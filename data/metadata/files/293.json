Though wholly unlike the first volume, it is\nwritten in furtherance of the same main idea, that every boy's life is\na campaign, more or less difficult, in which success depends upon\nintegrity and a steadfast adherence to duty.\n\nHow Paul Prescott gained strength by battling with adverse\ncircumstances, and, under all discouragements, kept steadily before him\nthe charge which he received from his dying father, is fully told; and\nthe author will be glad if the record shall prove an incentive and an\nencouragement to those boys who may have a similar campaign before them.\n\n\n\n\nPAUL PRESCOTT'S CHARGE.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nSQUIRE NEWCOME.\n\n\n“HANNAH!”\n\nThe speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge\nclose upon fifty. He was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair,\nand looked as if it would be quite impossible to deviate from his\nposition of unbending rigidity.\n\nSquire Benjamin Newcome, as he was called, in the right of his position\nas Justice of the Peace, Chairman of the Selectmen, and wealthiest\nresident of Wrenville, was a man of rule and measure. He was measured\nin his walk, measured in his utterance, and measured in all his\ntransactions. He might be called a dignified machine. He had a very\nexalted conception of his own position, and the respect which he felt to\nbe his due, not only from his own household, but from all who approached\nhim. If the President of the United States had called upon him, Squire\nNewcome would very probably have felt that he himself was the party who\nconferred distinction, and not received it.\n\nSquire Newcome was a widower. His wife, who was as different from\nhimself as could well be conceived, did not live long after marriage.\nShe was chilled to death, as it was thought, by the dignified iceberg\nof whose establishment she had become a part. She had left, however, a\nchild, who had now grown to be a boy of twelve. This boy was a thorn\nin the side of his father, who had endeavored in vain to mould him\naccording to his idea of propriety. But Ben was gifted with a spirit of\nfun, sometimes running into mischief, which was constantly bursting out\nin new directions, in spite of his father's numerous and rather prosy\nlectures.\n\n“Han-nah!” again called Squire Newcome, separating the two syllables by\na pause of deliberation, and strongly accenting the last syllable,--a\nhabit of his with all proper names.\n\nHannah was the Irish servant of all work, who was just then engaged in\nmixing up bread in the room adjoining, which was the kitchen.\n\nFeeling a natural reluctance to appear before her employer with her\nhands covered with dough, she hastily washed them. All this, however,\ntook time, and before she responded to the first summons, the second\n“Han-nah!” delivered with a little sharp emphasis, had been uttered.\n\nAt length she appeared at the door of the sitting-room.\n\n“Han-nah!” said Squire Newcome, fixing his cold gray eye upon her, “when\nyou hear my voice a calling you, it is your duty to answer the summons\nIMMEJIATELY.”\n\nI have endeavored to represent the Squire's pronunciation of the last\nword.\n\n“So I would have come IMMEJOUSLY,” said Hannah, displaying a most\nreprehensible ignorance, “but me hands were all covered with flour.”\n\n“That makes no difference,” interrupted the Squire. “Flour is an\naccidental circumstance.”\n\n“What's that?” thought Hannah, opening her eyes in amazement.\n\n“And should not be allowed to interpose an obstacle to an IMMEJIATE\nanswer to my summons.”\n\n“Sir,” said Hannah, who guessed at the meaning though she did not\nunderstand the words, “you wouldn't have me dirty the door-handle with\nme doughy hands?”\n\n“That could easily be remedied by ablution.”\n\n“There ain't any ablution in the house,” said the mystified Hannah.\n\n“I mean,” Squire Newcome condescended to explain, “the application of\nwater--in short, washing.”\n\n“Shure,” said Hannah, as light broke in upon her mind, “I never knew\nthat was what they called it before.”\n\n“Is Ben-ja-min at home?”\n\n“Yes, sir. He was out playin' in the yard a minute ago. I guess you can\nsee him from the winder.”\n\nSo saying she stepped forward, and looking out, all at once gave a\nshrill scream, and rushed from the room, leaving her employer in his\nbolt-upright attitude gazing after her with as much astonishment as he\nwas capable of.\n\nThe cause of her sudden exit was revealed on looking out of the window.\n\nMaster Benjamin, or Ben, as he was called everywhere except in his\nown family, had got possession of the black kitten, and appeared to be\nsubmerging her in the hogshead of rainwater.\n\n“O, you wicked, cruel boy, to drown poor Kitty!” exclaimed the indignant\nHannah, rushing into the yard and endeavoring to snatch her feline\nfavorite--an attempt which Ben stoutly resisted.\n\nDoubtless the poor kitten would have fared badly between the two, had\nnot the window opened, and the deliberate voice of his father, called\nout in tones which Ben saw fit to heed.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Come into my presence immejiately, and learn to answer me with more\nrespect.”\n\nBen came in looking half defiant.\n\nHis father, whose perpendicularity made him look like a sitting\ngrenadier, commenced the examination thus:--\n\n“I wish you to inform me what you was a doing of when I spoke to you.”\n\nIt will be observed that the Squire's dignified utterances were\nsometimes a little at variance with the rule of the best modern\ngrammarians.\n\n“I was trying to prevent Hannah from taking the kitten,” said Ben.\n\n“What was you a doing of before Hannah went out?”\n\n“Playing with Kitty.”\n\n“Why were you standing near the hogshead, Benjamin?”\n\n“Why,” said Ben, ingenuously, “the hogshead happened to be near me--that\nwas all.”\n\n“Were you not trying to drown the kitten?”\n\n“O, I wouldn't drown her for anything,” said Ben with an injured\nexpression, mentally adding, “short of a three-cent piece.”\n\n“Then, to repeat my interrogatory, what was you a doing of with the\nkitten in the hogshead?”\n\n“I was teaching her to swim,” said Ben, looking out of the corner of\nhis eye at his father, to see what impression this explanation made upon\nhim.\n\n“And what advantageous result do you think would be brought about by\nteaching of the kitten to swim, Benjamin?” persisted his father.\n\n“Advantageous result!” repeated Ben, demurely, pretending not to\nunderstand.\n\n“Certingly.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“Do you not study your dictionary at school, Benjamin?”\n\n“Yes, but I don't like it much.”\n\n“You are very much in error. You will never learn to employ your tongue\nwith elegance and precision, unless you engage in this beneficial\nstudy.”\n\n“I can use my tongue well enough, without studying grammar,” said Ben.\nHe proceeded to illustrate the truth of this assertion by twisting his\ntongue about in a comical manner.\n\n“Tongue,” exclaimed his father, “is but another name for language I mean\nyour native language.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\nBen was about to leave the room to avoid further questions of an\nembarrassing nature, when his father interrupted his exit by saying--\n\n“Stay, Benjamin, do not withdraw till I have made all the inquiries\nwhich I intend.”\n\nThe boy unwillingly returned.\n\n“You have not answered my question.”\n\n“I've forgotten what it was.”\n\n“What good would it do?” asked the Squire, simplifying his speech to\nreach Ben's comprehension, “what good would it do to teach the kitten to\nswim?”\n\n“O, I thought,” said Ben, hesitating, “that some time or other she might\nhappen to fall into the water, and might not be able to get out unless\nshe knew how.”\n\n“I think,” said his father with an unusual display of sagacity, “that\nshe will be in much greater hazard of drowning while learning to swim\nunder your direction than by any other chance likely to befall her.”\n\n“Shouldn't wonder,” was Ben's mental comment, “Pretty cute for you,\ndad.”\n\nFortunately, Ben did not express his thoughts aloud. They would have\nimplied such an utter lack of respect that the Squire would have been\nquite overwhelmed by the reflection that his impressive manners had\nproduced no greater effect on one who had so excellent a chance of being\nimpressed by them.\n\n“Benjamin,” concluded his father, “I have an errand for you to execute.\nYou may go to Mr. Prescott's and see if he is yet living. I hear that he\nis a lying on the brink of the grave.”\n\nAn expression of sadness stole over the usually merry face of Ben, as he\nstarted on his errand.\n\n“Poor Paul!” he thought, “what will he do when his father dies? He's\nsuch a capital fellow, too. I just wish I had a wagon load of money, I\ndo, and I'd give him half. That's so!”\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nPAUL PRESCOTT'S HOME.\n\n\nWe will precede Ben on his visit to the house of Mr. Prescott.\n\nIt was an old weather-beaten house, of one story, about half a mile\ndistant from 'Squire Newcome's residence. The Prescott family had lived\nhere for five years, or ever since they had removed to Wrenville. Until\nwithin a year they had lived comfortably, when two blows came in quick\nsuccession. The first was the death of Mrs. Prescott, an excellent\nwoman, whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son. Soon\nafterwards Mr. Prescott, a carpenter by trade, while at work upon the\nroof of a high building, fell off, and not only broke his leg badly, but\nsuffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature. He had\nnot been able to do a stroke of work since. After some months it became\nevident that he would never recover. A year had now passed. During\nthis time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had\nsucceeded in laying up previous to his sickness. It was clear that at\nhis death there would be nothing left. At thirteen years of age Paul\nwould have to begin the world without a penny.\n\nMr. Prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen.\nPaul, a thoughtful-looking boy sat beside it, ready to answer his call.\n\nThere had been silence for some time, when Mr. Prescott called feebly--\n\n“Paul!”\n\n“I am here, father,” said Paul.\n\n“I am almost gone, Paul, I don't think I shall last through the day.”\n\n“O, father,” said Paul, sorrowfully, “Don't leave me.”\n\n“That is the only grief I have in dying--I must leave you to struggle\nfor yourself, Paul. I shall be able to leave you absolutely nothing.”\n\n“Don't think of that, father. I am young and strong--I can earn my\nliving in some way.”\n\n“I hoped to live long enough to give you an education. I wanted you to\nhave a fairer start in the world than I had.”\n\n“Never mind, father,” said Paul, soothingly, “Don't be uneasy about me.\nGod will provide for me.”\n\nAgain there was a silence, broken only by the difficult breathing of the\nsick man.\n\nHe spoke again.\n\n“There is one thing, Paul, that I want to tell you before I die.”\n\nPaul drew closer to the bedside.\n\n“It is something which has troubled me as I lay here. I shall feel\neasier for speaking of it. You remember that we lived at Cedarville\nbefore we came here.”\n\n“Yes, father.”\n\n“About two years before we left there, a promising speculation was\nbrought to my notice. An agent of a Lake Superior mine visited our\nvillage and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of\nmy neighbors bought shares, fully expecting to double their money in a\nyear. Among the rest I was attacked with the fever of speculation. I had\nalways been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation, and had\nnot been able to do much more than support my family. This it seemed to\nme, afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something\nwhich might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of\nsickness. I had but about two hundred dollars, however, and from so\nscanty an investment I could not, of course, expect a large return;\naccordingly I went to Squire Conant; you remember him, Paul?”\n\n“Yes, father.”\n\n'I went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars. After some\nhesitation he agreed to lend it to me. He was fond of his money and not\nmuch given to lending, but it so happened that he had invested in the\nsame speculation, and had a high opinion of it, so he felt pretty\nsafe in advancing me the money. Well, this loan gave me seven hundred\ndollars, with which I purchased seven shares in the Lake Superior Grand\nCombination Mining Company. For some months afterwards, I felt like a\nrich man. I carefully put away my certificate of stock, looking upon\nit as the beginning of a competence. But at the end of six months the\nbubble burst--the stock proved to be utterly worthless,--Squire Conant\nlost five thousand dollars. I lost seven hundred, five hundred being\nborrowed money. The Squire's loss was much larger, but mine was the more\nserious, since I lost everything and was plunged into debt, while he had\nat least forty thousand dollars left.\n\n“Two days after the explosion, Squire Conant came into my shop and asked\nabruptly when I could pay him the amount I had borrowed. I told him that\nI could not fix a time. I said that I had been overwhelmed by a result\nso contrary to my anticipations, but I told him I would not rest till I\nhad done something to satisfy his claim. He was always an unreasonable\nman, and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless\nspeculation, as if I could foresee how it would end any better than he.”\n\n“Have you ever been able to pay back any part of the five hundred\ndollars, father?”\n\n“I have paid the interest regularly, and a year ago, just before I met\nwith my accident, I had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which I had\nintended to pay the Squire, but when my sickness came I felt obliged to\nretain it to defray our expenses, being cut off from earning anything.”\n\n“Then I suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last\nyear.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Have you heard from the Squire lately?”\n\n“Yes, I had a letter only last week. You remember bringing me one\npostmarked Cedarville?”\n\n“Yes, I wondered at the time who it could be from.”\n\n“You will find it on the mantelpiece. I should like to have you get it\nand read it.”\n\nPaul readily found the letter. It was enclosed in a brown envelope,\ndirected in a bold hand to “Mr. John Prescott, Wrenville.”\n\nThe letter was as follows:--\n\n\nCEDARVILLE, APRIL 15, 18--,\n\nMR. JOHN PRESCOTT:--\n\nSIR: I have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five\nhundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me, on account of a\nloan which I was fool enough to make you seven years since. I thought\nyou an honest man, but I have found, to my cost, that I was mistaken.\nFor the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated\nbetween us. Your intention is evident. I quite understand that you have\nmade up your mind to defraud me of what is rightfully mine. I don't know\nhow you may regard this, but I consider it as bad as highway robbery. I\ndo not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the\nPenitentiary. Let me advise you, if you wish to avoid further trouble,\nto make no delay in paying a portion of this debt. Yours, etc. EZEKIEL\nCONANT.\n\n\nPaul's face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel\nletter.\n\n“Does Squire Conant know that you are sick, father?” he inquired.\n\n“Yes, I wrote him about my accident, telling him at the same time that\nI regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must\noccasion in my payments.”\n\n“And knowing this, he wrote such a letter as that,” said Paul,\nindignantly, “what a hard, unfeeling wretch he must be!”\n\n“I suppose it is vexatious to him to be kept out of his money.”\n\n“But he has plenty more. He would never miss it if he had given it to\nyou outright.”\n\n“That is not the way to look at it, Paul. The money is justly his, and\nit is a great sorrow to me that I must die without paying it.”\n\n“Father,” said Paul, after a pause, “will it be any relief to you, if I\npromise to pay it,--that is, if I am ever able?”\n\nMr. Prescott's face brightened.\n\n“That was what I wanted to ask you, Paul. It will be a comfort to me to\nfeel that there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day.”\n\n“Then don't let it trouble you any longer, father. The debt shall be\nmine, and I will pay it.”\n\nAgain a shadow passed over the sick man's face, “Poor boy,” he said,\n“why should I burden your young life with such a load? You will have to\nstruggle hard enough as it is. No, Paul, recall your promise. I don't\nwant to purchase comfort at such a price.”\n\n“No, father,” said Paul sturdily, “it is too late now. I have made the\npromise and I mean to stick to it. Besides, it will give me something\nto live for. I am young--I may have a great many years before me. For\nthirteen years you have supported me. It is only right that I should\nmake what return I can. I'll keep my promise, father.”\n\n“May God help and prosper you, my boy,” said Mr. Prescott, solemnly.\n“You've been a good son; I pray that you may grow up to be a good man.\nBut, my dear, I feel tired. I think I will try to go to sleep.”\n\nPaul smoothed the comforter, adjusting it carefully about his father's\nneck, and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place\nupon the fire. Their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted, and Paul\nwas obliged to go into the woods near by, to obtain such loose fagots as\nhe might find upon the ground.\n\nHe was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a\nwhistle. Looking up he discovered Ben Newcome approaching him.\n\n“How are you, Paul?”\n\n“Pretty well, Ben.”\n\n“How precious lonesome you must be, mewed up in the house all the time.”\n\n“Yes, it is lonesome, but I wouldn't mind that if I thought father would\never get any better.”\n\n“How is he this morning?”\n\n“Pretty low; I expect he is asleep. He said he was tired just before I\nwent out.”\n\n“I brought over something for you,” said Ben, tugging away at his\npocket.\n\nOpening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown.\n\n“I found 'em in the closet,” he said.\n\n“Won't Hannah make a precious row when she finds 'em gone?”\n\n“Then I don't know as I ought to take them,” said Paul, though, to tell\nthe truth, they looked tempting to him.\n\n“O, nonsense,” said Ben; “they don't belong to Hannah. She only likes to\nscold a little; it does her good.”\n\nThe two boys sat on the doorstep and talked while Paul ate the\nturnovers. Ben watched the process with much satisfaction.\n\n“Ain't they prime?” he said.\n\n“First rate,” said Paul; “won't you have one?”\n\n“No,” said Ben; “you see I thought while I was about it I might as well\ntake four, so I ate two coming along.”\n\nIn about fifteen minutes Paul went into the house to look at his father.\nHe was lying very quietly upon the bed. Paul drew near and looked at him\nmore closely. There was something in the expression of his father's face\nwhich terrified him.\n\nBen heard his sudden cry of dismay, and hurriedly entered.\n\nPaul pointed to the bed, and said briefly, “Father's dead!”\n\nBen, who in spite of his mischievous propensities was gifted with a warm\nheart, sat down beside Paul, and passing his arm round his neck,\ngave him that silent sympathy which is always so grateful to the\ngrief-stricken heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nPAUL'S BRILLIANT PROSPECTS.\n\n\nTwo days later, the funeral of Mr. Prescott took place.\n\nPoor Paul! It seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow. His father\nand mother both gone, he felt that he was indeed left alone in the\nworld. No thought of the future had yet entered his mind. He was wholly\noccupied with his present sorrow. Desolate at heart he slipped away from\nthe graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over, and took his way back\nagain to the lonely dwelling which he had called home.\n\nAs he was sitting in the corner, plunged in sorrowful thought, there was\na scraping heard at the door, and a loud hem!\n\nLooking up, Paul saw entering the cottage the stiff form of Squire\nBenjamin Newcome, who, as has already been stated, was the owner.\n\n“Paul,” said the Squire, with measured deliberation.\n\n“Do you mean me, sir?” asked Paul, vaguely conscious that his name had\nbeen called.\n\n“Did I not address you by your baptismal appellation?” demanded the\nSquire, who thought the boy's question superfluous.\n\n“Paul,” pursued Squire Newcome, “have you thought of your future\ndestination?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Paul, “I suppose I shall live here.”\n\n“That arrangement would not be consistent with propriety. I suppose you\nare aware that your deceased parent left little or no worldly goods.”\n\n“I know he was poor.”\n\n“Therefore it has been thought best that you should be placed in charge\nof a worthy man, who I see is now approaching the house. You will\ntherefore accompany him without resistance. If you obey him and read the\nBible regularly, you will--ahem!--you will some time or other see the\nadvantage of it.”\n\nWith this consolatory remark Squire Newcome wheeled about and strode out\nof the house.\n\nImmediately afterwards there entered a rough-looking man arrayed in a\nfarmer's blue frock.\n\n“You're to come with me, youngster,” said Mr. Nicholas Mudge, for that\nwas his name.\n\n“With you?” said Paul, recoiling instinctively.\n\nIn fact there was nothing attractive in the appearance or manners of\nMr. Mudge. He had a coarse hard face, while his head was surmounted by\na shock of red hair, which to all appearance had suffered little\ninterference from the comb for a time which the observer would scarcely\nventure to compute. There was such an utter absence of refinement about\nthe man, that Paul, who had been accustomed to the gentle manners of his\nfather, was repelled by the contrast which this man exhibited.\n\n“To be sure you're to go with me,” said Mr. Mudge. “You did not\ncalc'late you was a goin' to stay here by yourself, did you? We've got a\nbetter place for you than that. But the wagon's waitin' outside, so just\nbe lively and bundle in, and I'll carry you to where you're a goin' to\nlive.”\n\n“Where's that?”\n\n“Wal, some folks call it the Poor House, but it ain't any the worse for\nthat, I expect. Anyhow, them as has no money may feel themselves lucky\nto get so good a home. So jest be a movin', for I can't be a waitin'\nhere all day.”\n\nPaul quietly submitted himself to the guidance of Mr. Mudge. He was so\noccupied with the thought of his sad loss that he did not realize the\nchange that was about to take place in his circumstances.\n\nAbout half a mile from the village in the bleakest and most desolate\npart of the town, stood the Poor House. It was a crazy old building of\nextreme antiquity, which, being no longer considered fit for an ordinary\ndwelling-house, had been selected as a suitable residence for the town's\npoor. It was bleak and comfortless to be sure, but on that very account\nhad been purchased at a trifling expense, and that was, of course, a\nprimary consideration. Connected with the house were some dozen acres of\nrough-looking land, plentifully overspread with stones, which might have\nfilled with despair the most enterprising agriculturist. However, it had\nthis recommendation at least, that it was quite in character with the\nbuildings upon it, which in addition to the house already described,\nconsisted of a barn of equal antiquity and a pig pen.\n\nThis magnificent domain was under the superintendence of Mr. Nicholas\nMudge, who in consideration of taking charge of the town paupers had\nthe use of the farm and buildings, rent free, together with a stipulated\nweekly sum for each of the inmates.\n\n“Well, Paul,” said Mr. Mudge, as they approached the house, in a tone\nwhich was meant to be encouraging, “this is goin' to be your home. How\ndo you like it?”\n\nThus addressed, Paul ventured a glance around him.\n\n“I don't know,” said he, doubtfully; “it don't look very pleasant.”\n\n“Don't look very pleasant!” repeated Mr. Mudge in a tone of mingled\namazement and indignation. “Well, there's gratitude for you. After the\ntown has been at the expense of providin' a nice, comfortable home for\nyou, because you haven't got any of your own, you must turn up your nose\nat it.”\n\n“I didn't mean to complain,” said Paul, feeling very little interest in\nthe matter.\n\n“Perhaps you expected to live in a marble palace,” pursued Mr. Mudge, in\nan injured tone. “We don't have any marble palaces in this neighborhood,\nwe don't.”\n\nPaul disclaimed any such anticipation.\n\nMr. Mudge deigned to accept Paul's apology, and as they had now reached\nthe door, unceremoniously threw it open, and led the way into a room\nwith floor unpainted, which, to judge from its appearance, was used as a\nkitchen.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nLIFE IN A NEW PHASE.\n\n\nEverything was “at sixes and sevens,” as the saying is, in the room Mr.\nMudge and Paul had just entered. In the midst of the scene was a large\nstout woman, in a faded calico dress, and sleeves rolled up, working as\nif her life or the world's destiny depended upon it.\n\nIt was evident from the first words of Mr. Mudge that this lady was his\nhelpmeet.\n\n“Well, wife,” he said, “I've brought you another boarder. You must try\nto make him as happy and contented as the rest of 'em are.”\n\nFrom the tone of the speaker, the last words might be understood to be\njocular.\n\nMrs. Mudge, whose style of beauty was not improved by a decided squint,\nfixed a scrutinizing gaze upon Paul, and he quite naturally returned it.\n\n“Haven't you ever seen anybody before, boy? I guess you'll know me next\ntime.”\n\n“Shouldn't wonder if he did,” chuckled Mr. Mudge.\n\n“I don't know where on earth we shall put him,” remarked the lady.\n“We're full now.”\n\n“Oh, put him anywhere. I suppose you won't be very particular about your\naccommodations?” said Mr. Mudge turning to Paul.\n\nPaul very innocently answered in the negative, thereby affording Mr.\nMudge not a little amusement.\n\n“Well, that's lucky,” he said, “because our best front chamber's\noccupied just now. We'd have got it ready for you if you'd only wrote a\nweek ago to tell us you were coming. You can just stay round here,” he\nsaid in a different tone as he was about leaving the room, “Mrs. Mudge\nwill maybe want you to do something for her. You can sit down till she\ncalls on you.”\n\nIt was washing day with Mrs. Mudge, and of course she was extremely\nbusy. The water was to be brought from a well in the yard, and to this\noffice Paul was at once delegated. It was no easy task, the full pails\ntugging most unmercifully at his arms. However, this was soon over, and\nMrs. Mudge graciously gave him permission to go into the adjoining room,\nand make acquaintance with his fellow-boarders.\n\nThere were nine of them in all, Paul, the newcomer making the tenth.\nThey were all advanced in years, except one young woman, who was\nprevented by mental aberration from supporting herself outside the walls\nof the Institution.\n\nOf all present, Paul's attention was most strongly attracted towards one\nwho appeared more neatly and scrupulously attired than any of the rest.\n\nAunt Lucy Lee, or plain Aunt Lucy, for in her present abode she had\nsmall use for her last name, was a benevolent-looking old lady, who both\nin dress and manners was distinguished from her companions. She rose\nfrom her knitting, and kindly took Paul by the hand. Children are\ninstinctive readers of character, and Paul, after one glance at her\nbenevolent face, seated himself contentedly beside her.\n\n“I suppose,” said the old lady, socially, “you've come to live with\nus. We must do all we can to make you comfortable. Your name is Paul\nPrescott, I think Mrs. Mudge said.”\n\n“Yes, ma'am,” answered Paul, watching the rapid movement of the old\nlady's fingers.\n\n“Mine is Aunt Lucy,” she continued, “that is what everybody calls me.\nSo now we know each other, and shall soon be good friends, I hope. I\nsuppose you have hardly been here long enough to tell how you shall like\nit.”\n\nPaul confessed that thus far he did not find it very pleasant.\n\n“No, I dare say not,” said Aunt Lucy, “I can't say I think it looks very\nattractive myself. However, it isn't wholly the fault of Mr. and Mrs.\nMudge. They can't afford to do much better, for the town allows them\nvery little.”\n\nAunt Lucy's remarks were here interrupted by the apparition of the\nworthy landlady at the door.\n\n“Dinner's ready, folks,” said that lady, with little ceremony, “and you\nmust come out quick if you want any, for I'm drove with work, and can't\nbe hindered long.”\n\nThe summons was obeyed with alacrity, and the company made all haste to\nthe dining-room, or rather the kitchen, for it was here that the meals\nwere eaten.\n\nIn the center of the room was set a table without a cloth, a table-cloth\nbeing considered a luxury quite superfluous. Upon this were placed\nseveral bowls of thin, watery liquid, intended for soup, but which, like\ncity milk, was diluted so as hardly to be distinguishable. Beside each\nbowl was a slice of bread.\n\nSuch was the bill of fare.\n\n“Now, folks, the sooner you fall to the better,” exclaimed the energetic\nMrs. Mudge, who was one of those driving characters, who consider any\ntime spent at the table beyond ten minutes as so much time wasted.\n\nThe present company appeared to need no second invitation. Their\nscanty diet had the positive advantage of giving them a good appetite;\notherwise the quality of their food might have daunted them.\n\nPaul took his place beside Aunt Lucy. Mechanically he did as the rest,\ncarrying to his mouth a spoonful of the liquid. But his appetite was not\nsufficiently accustomed to Poor House regime to enable him to relish its\nstanding dish, and he laid down his spoon with a disappointed look.\n\nHe next attacked the crust of bread, but found it too dry to be\npalatable.\n\n“Please, ma'am,” said he to Mrs. Mudge, “I should like some butter.”\n\nPaul's companions dropped their spoons in astonishment at his daring,\nand Mrs. Mudge let fall a kettle she was removing from the fire, in\nsheer amazement.\n\n“What did you ask for?” she inquired, as if to make sure that her ears\ndid not deceive her.\n\n“A little butter,” repeated Paul, unconscious of the great presumption\nof which he had been guilty.\n\n“You want butter, do you?” repeated Mr. Mudge. “Perhaps you'd like a\nslice of beefsteak and a piece of plum-pudding too, wouldn't you?”\n\n“I should very much,” said Paul, resolved to tell the truth, although he\nnow began to perceive the sarcasm in his landlady's tone.\n\n“There isn't anything more you would like, is there?” inquired the lady,\nwith mock politeness.\n\n“No, ma'am,” returned Paul after a pause, “I believe not, to-day.”\n\n“Very moderate, upon my word,” exclaimed Mrs. Mudge, giving vent at\nlength to her pentup indignation. “You'll be contented with butter and\nroast beef and plum-pudding! A mighty fine gentleman, to be sure. But\nyou won't get them here, I'll be bound.”\n\n“So will I,” thought Aunt Lucy.\n\n“If you ain't satisfied with what I give you,” pursued Mrs. Mudge,\n“you'd better go somewhere else. You can put up at some of the great\nhotels. Butter, forsooth!”\n\nHaving thus given expression to her feelings, she left the room, and\nPaul was left to finish his dinner with the best appetite he could\ncommand. He was conscious that he had offended Mrs. Mudge, but the\nthoughts of his recent great sorrow swallowed up all minor annoyances,\nso that the words of his estimable landlady were forgotten almost as\nsoon as they were uttered. He felt that he must henceforth look for far\ndifferent treatment from that to which he had been accustomed during his\nfather's lifetime.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted in a manner somewhat ludicrous, by the\ncrazy girl who sat next to him coolly appropriating to herself his bowl\nof soup, having already disposed of her own.\n\n“Look,” said Aunt Lucy, quickly, calling Paul's attention, “you are\nlosing your dinner.”\n\n“Never mind,” said Paul, amused in spite of his sadness, “she is quite\nwelcome to it if she likes it; I can't eat it.”\n\nSo the dinner began and ended. It was very brief and simple, occupying\nless than ten minutes, and comprising only one course--unless the soup\nwas considered the first course, and the bread the second. Paul left\nthe table as hungry as he came to it. Aunt Lucy's appetite had become\naccustomed to the Mudge diet, and she wisely ate what was set before\nher, knowing that there was no hope of anything better.\n\nAbout an hour after dinner Ben Newcome came to the door of the Poor\nHouse and inquired for Paul.\n\nMrs. Mudge was in one of her crusty moods.\n\n“You can't see him,” said she.\n\n“And why not?” said Ben, resolutely.\n\n“Because he's busy.”\n\n“You'd better let me see him,” said Ben, sturdily.\n\n“I should like to know what's going to happen if I don't,” said Mrs.\nMudge, with wrathful eyes, and arms akimbo.\n\n“I shall go home and report to my father,” said Ben, coolly.\n\n“Who is your father?” asked Mrs. Mudge, for she did not recognize her\nvisitor.\n\n“My father's name is Newcome--Squire Newcome, some call him.”\n\nNow it so happened that Squire Newcome was Chairman of the Overseers of\nthe Poor, and in that capacity might remove Mr. Mudge from office if he\npleased. Accordingly Mrs. Mudge softened down at once, on learning that\nBen was his son.\n\n“Oh,” said she, “I didn't know who it was. I thought it might be some\nidle boy from the village who would only take Paul from his work, but if\nyou have a message from your father----”\n\nThis she said to ascertain whether he really had any message or not, but\nBen, who had in fact come without his father's knowledge, only bowed,\nand said, in a patronizing manner, “I accept your apology, Mrs. Mudge.\nWill you have the goodness to send Paul out?”\n\n“Won't you step in?” asked Mrs. Mudge with unusual politeness.\n\n“No, I believe not.”\n\nPaul was accordingly sent out.\n\nHe was very glad to meet his schoolmate and playfellow, Ben, who by his\ngayety, spiced though it was with roguery, had made himself a general\nfavorite in school.\n\n“I say, Paul,” said Ben, “I'm sorry to find you in such a place.”\n\n“It isn't very pleasant,” said Paul, rather soberly.\n\n“And that woman--Mrs. Mudge--she looks as if she might be a regular\nspitfire, isn't she?”\n\n“Rather so.”\n\n“I only wish the old gentleman--meaning of course, the Squire--would\ntake you to live with me. I want a fellow to play with. But I say, Paul,\ngo and get your hat, and we'll go out for a walk.”\n\n“I don't know what Mrs. Mudge will say,” said Paul, who had just come\nfrom turning the handle of a churn.\n\n“Just call Mrs. Mudge, and I'll manage it.”\n\nMrs. Mudge being summoned, made her appearance at the door.\n\n“I presume, ma'am,” said Ben, confidently, “you will have no objection\nto Paul's taking a walk with me while I deliver the message I am\nentrusted with.”\n\n“Certainly,” said Mrs. Mudge, rather unwillingly, but not venturing to\nrefuse.\n\n“It takes me to come it over the old lady,” said Ben, when they were out\nof hearing.\n\n“Now, we'll go a fishing.”\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nA CRISIS.\n\n\nBefore sunrise the next morning Paul was awakened by a rude shake from\nMr. Mudge, with an intimation that he had better get up, as there was\nplenty of work before him.\n\nBy the light of the lantern, for as yet it was too dark to dispense with\nit, Paul dressed himself. Awakened from a sound sleep, he hardly had\ntime to collect his thoughts, and it was with a look of bewilderment\nthat he surveyed the scene about him. As Mrs. Mudge had said, they were\npretty full already, and accordingly a rude pallet had been spread for\nhim in the attic, of which, with the exception of nocturnal marauders,\nhe was the only occupant. Paul had not, to be sure, been used to very\nsuperior accommodations, and if the bed had not been quite so hard, he\nwould have got along very well. As it was he was separated from slats\nonly by a thin straw bed which did not improve matters much. It was\ntherefore with a sense of weariness which slumber had not dissipated,\nthat Paul arose at the summons of Mr. Mudge.\n\nWhen he reached the kitchen, he found that gentleman waiting for him.\n\n“Do you know how to milk?” was his first salutation.\n\n“I never learned,” said Paul.\n\n“Then you'll have to, in double-quick time,” was the reply, “for I don't\nrelish getting up so early, and you can take it off my hands.”\n\nThe two proceeded to the barn, where Paul received his first lesson in\nthis important branch of education.\n\nMr. Mudge kept five cows. One might have thought he could have afforded\na moderate supply of milk to his boarders, but all, with the exception\nof a single quart, was sold to the milkman who passed the door every\nmorning.\n\nAfter breakfast, which was on the same economical plan with the dinner\nof the day previous, Paul was set to work planting potatoes, at which he\nwas kept steadily employed till the dinner-hour.\n\nPoor Paul! his back ached dreadfully, for he had never before done any\nharder work than trifling services for his father. But the inexorable\nMr. Mudge was in sight, and however much he wished, he did not dare to\nlay aside his hoe even for a moment.\n\nTwelve o'clock found him standing beside the dinner-table. He ate more\nheartily than before, for his forenoon's labor made even poorhouse fare\npalatable.\n\nMrs. Mudge observed the change, and remarked in a satisfied tone. “Well,\nmy fine gentleman, I see you are coming to your appetite. I thought you\nwouldn't hold out long.”\n\nPaul, who had worn off something of his diffidence, could not help\nfeeling indignant at this speech; unaccustomed to be addressed in this\nway, the taunt jarred upon his feelings, but he only bit his lip and\npreserved silence.\n\nAunt Lucy, too, who had come to feel a strong interest in Paul, despite\nher natural mildness, could not resist the temptation of saying with\nsome warmth, “what's the use of persecuting the child? He has sorrows\nenough of his own without your adding to them.”\n\nMrs. Mudge was not a little incensed at this remonstrance.\n\n“I should like to know, ma'am, who requested you to put in your oar!”\n she said with arms akimbo. “Anybody wouldn't think from your lofty airs\nthat you lived in the poorhouse; I'll thank you to mind your own\nbusiness in the future, and not meddle with what don't concern you.”\n\nAunt Lucy was wise enough to abstain from provoking further the wrath of\nher amiable landlady, and continued to eat her soup in silence. But Mrs.\nMudge neer forgot this interference, nor the cause of it, and henceforth\nwith the malignity of a narrow-minded and spiteful woman, did what she\ncould to make Paul uncomfortable. Her fertile ingenuity always found\nsome new taunt, or some new reproach, to assail him with. But Paul,\nthough at first he felt indignant, learned at last to treat them as they\ndeserved, with silent disdain. Assured of the sympathy of those around\nhim, he did not allow his appetite to be spoiled by any remark which\nMrs. Mudge might offer.\n\nThis, of course, only provoked her the more, and she strove to have his\ndaily tasks increased, in the amiable hope that his “proud spirit” might\nbe tamed thereby.\n\nMr. Mudge, who was somewhat under petticoat government, readily acceded\nto his wife's wishes, and henceforth Paul's strength was taxed to its\nutmost limit. He was required to be up with the first gray tint of dawn\nand attend to the cattle. From this time until night, except the brief\ntime devoted to his meals, he was incessantly occupied. Aunt Lucy's\nsociety, his chief comfort, was thus taken from him; since, in order to\nrise early, he was obliged to go to bed as soon as possible after day's\nwork was finished.\n\nThe effects of such incessant labor without a sufficient supply of\nnourishing food, may easily be imagined. The dry bread and meagre soup\nwhich constituted the chief articles of diet in Mrs. Mudge's economical\nhousehold, had but one recommendation,--they were effectual preventives\nof gluttony. It was reported that on one occasion a beggar, apparently\nfamishing with hunger, not knowing the character of the house, made\napplication at the door for food. In an unusual fit of generosity, Mrs.\nMudge furnished him with a slice of bread and a bowl of soup, which,\nhowever, proved so far from tempting that the beggar, hungry as he was,\nleft them almost untouched.\n\nOne day, as Paul was working in the field at a little distance from\nMr. Mudge, he became conscious of a peculiar feeling of giddiness which\ncompelled him to cling to the hoe for support,--otherwise he must have\nfallen.\n\n“No laziness there,” exclaimed Mr. Mudge, observing Paul's cessation\nfrom labor, “We can't support you in idleness.”\n\nBut the boy paid no regard to this admonition, and Mr. Mudge, somewhat\nsurprised, advanced toward him to enforce the command.\n\nEven he was startled at the unusual paleness of Paul's face, and\ninquired in a less peremptory tone, “what's the matter?”\n\n“I feel sick,” gasped Paul.\n\nWithout another word, Mr. Mudge took Paul up in his arms and carried him\ninto the house.\n\n“What's the matter, now?” asked his wife, meeting him at the door.\n\n“The boy feels a little sick, but I guess he'll get over it by-and\nby. Haven't you got a little soup that you can give him? I reckon he's\nfaint, and that'll brighten him up.”\n\nPaul evidently did not think so, for he motioned away a bowl of the\ndelightful mixture, though it was proffered him by the fair hands of\nMrs. Mudge. The lady was somewhat surprised, and said, roughly, “I\nshouldn't wonder if he was only trying to shirk.”\n\nThis was too much even for Mr. Mudge; “The boy's sick,” said he, “that's\nplain enough; if he don't get better soon, I must send for the doctor,\nfor work drives, and I can't spare him.”\n\n“There's no more danger of his being sick than mine,” said Mrs. Mudge,\nemphatically; “however, if you're fool enough to go for a doctor, that's\nnone of my business. I've heard of feigning sickness before now, to\nget rid of work. As to his being pale, I've been as pale as that myself\nsometimes without your troubling yourself very much about me.”\n\n“'Twon't be any expense to us,” alleged Mr. Mudge, in a tone of\njustification, for he felt in some awe of his wife's temper, which was\nnone of the mildest when a little roused, “'Twon't be any expense to us;\nthe town has got to pay for it, and as long as it will get him ready for\nwork sooner, we might as well take advantage of it.”\n\nThis consideration somewhat reconciled Mrs. Mudge to the step proposed,\nand as Paul, instead of getting better, grew rapidly worse, Mr. Mudge\nthought it expedient to go immediately for the village physician.\nLuckily Dr. Townsend was at home, and an hour afterwards found him\nstanding beside the sick boy.\n\n“I don't know but you'll think it rather foolish, our sending for you,\ndoctor,” said Mrs. Mudge, “but Mudge would have it that the boy was sick\nand so he went for you.”\n\n“And he did quite right,” said Dr. Townsend, noticing the ghastly pallor\nof Paul's face. “He is a very sick boy, and if I had not been called I\nwould not have answered for the consequences. How do you feel, my boy?”\n he inquired of Paul.\n\n“I feel very weak, and my head swims,” was the reply.\n\n“How and when did this attack come on?” asked the doctor, turning to Mr.\nMudge.\n\n“He was taken while hoeing in the field,” was the reply.\n\n“Have you kept him at work much there lately?”\n\n“Well, yes, I've been drove by work, and he has worked there all day\nlatterly.”\n\n“At what time has he gone to work in the morning?”\n\n“He has got up to milk the cows about five o'clock. I used to do it, but\nsince he has learned, I have indulged myself a little.”\n\n“It would have been well for him if he had enjoyed the same privilege.\nIt is my duty to speak plainly. The sickness of this boy lies at your\ndoor. He has never been accustomed to hard labor, and yet you have\nobliged him to rise earlier and work later than most men. No wonder he\nfeels weak. Has he a good appetite?”\n\n“Well, rather middlin',” said Mrs. Mudge, “but it's mainly because he's\ntoo dainty to eat what's set before him. Why, only the first day he was\nhere he turned up his nose at the bread and soup we had for dinner.”\n\n“Is this a specimen of the soup?” asked Dr. Townsend, taking from the\ntable the bowl which had been proffered to Paul and declined by him.\n\nWithout ceremony he raised to his lips a spoonful of the soup and tasted\nit with a wry face.\n\n“Do you often have this soup on the table?” he asked abruptly.\n\n“We always have it once a day, and sometimes twice,” returned Mrs.\nMudge.\n\n“And you call the boy dainty because he don't relish such stuff as\nthis?” said the doctor, with an indignation he did not attempt to\nconceal. “Why, I wouldn't be hired to take the contents of that bowl. It\nis as bad as any of my own medicines, and that's saying a good deal.\nHow much nourishment do you suppose such a mixture would afford? And yet\nwith little else to sustain him you have worked this boy like a beast of\nburden,--worse even, for they at least have abundance of GOOD food.”\n\nMr. and Mrs. Mudge both winced under this plain speaking, but they did\nnot dare to give expression to their anger, for they knew well that Dr.\nTownsend was an influential man in town, and, by representing the affair\nin the proper quarter, might render their hold upon their present post\na very precarious one. Mr. Mudge therefore contented himself with\nmuttering that he guessed he worked as hard as anybody, and he didn't\ncomplain of his fare.\n\n“May I ask you, Mr. Mudge,” said the doctor, fixing his penetrating eye\nfull upon him, “whether you confine yourself to the food upon which you\nhave kept this boy?”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Mudge, in some confusion, moving uneasily in his\nseat, “I can't say but now and then I eat something a little different.”\n\n“Do you eat at the same table with the inmates of your house?”\n\n“Well, no,” said the embarrassed Mr. Mudge.\n\n“Tell me plainly,--how often do you partake of this soup?”\n\n“I aint your patient,” said the man, sullenly, “Why should you want to\nknow what I eat?”\n\n“I have an object in view. Are you afraid to answer?”\n\n“I don't know as there's anything to be afraid of. The fact is, I aint\npartial to soup; it don't agree with me, and so I don't take it.”\n\n“Did you ever consider that this might be the case with others as\nwell as yourself?” inquired the doctor with a glance expressive of his\ncontempt for Mr. Mudge's selfishness. Without waiting for a reply, Dr.\nTownsend ordered Paul to be put to bed immediately, after which he would\nleave some medicine for him to take.\n\nHere was another embarrassment for the worthy couple. They hardly knew\nwhere to put our hero. It would not do for them to carry him to his\npallet in the attic, for they felt sure that this would lead to some\nmore plain speaking on the part of Dr. Townsend. He was accordingly,\nthough with some reluctance, placed in a small bedroom upstairs, which,\nbeing more comfortable than those appropriated to the paupers, had been\nreserved for a son at work in a neighboring town, on his occasional\nvisits home.\n\n“Is there no one in the house who can sit in the chamber and attend to\nhis occasional wants?” asked Dr. Townsend. “He will need to take his\nmedicine at stated periods, and some one will be required to administer\nit.”\n\n“There's Aunt Lucy Lee,” said Mrs. Mudge, “she's taken a fancy to the\nboy, and I reckon she'll do as well as anybody.”\n\n“No one better,” returned the doctor, who well knew Aunt Lucy's kindness\nof disposition, and was satisfied that she would take all possible care\nof his patient.\n\nSo it was arranged that Aunt Lucy should take her place at Paul's\nbedside as his nurse.\n\nPaul was sick for many days,--not dangerously so, but hard work and\nscanty fare had weakened him to such a degree that exhausted nature\nrequired time to recruit its wasted forces. But he was not unhappy or\nrestless. Hour after hour he would lie patiently, and listen to the\nclicking of her knitting needles. Though not provided with luxurious\nfood, Dr. Townsend had spoken with so much plainness that Mrs. Mudge\nfelt compelled to modify her treatment, lest, through his influence, she\nwith her husband, might lose their situation. This forced forbearance,\nhowever, was far from warming her heart towards its object. Mrs.\nMudge was a hard, practical woman, and her heart was so encrusted with\nworldliness and self-interest that she might as well have been without\none.\n\nOne day, as Paul lay quietly gazing at Aunt Lucy's benevolent face,\nand mentally contrasting it with that of Mrs. Mudge, whose shrill voice\ncould be heard form below, he was seized with a sudden desire to learn\nsomething of her past history.\n\n“How long have you been here, Aunt Lucy?” he inquired.\n\nShe looked up from her knitting, and sighed as she answered, “A long and\nweary time to look back upon, Paul. I have been here ten years.”\n\n“Ten years,” repeated Paul, thoughtfully, “and I am thirteen. So you\nhave been here nearly all my lifetime. Has Mr. Mudge been here all that\ntime?”\n\n“Only the last two years. Before that we had Mrs. Perkins.”\n\n“Did she treat you any better than Mrs. Mudge?”\n\n“Any better than Mrs. Mudge!” vociferated that lady, who had ascended\nthe stairs without being heard by Aunt Lucy of Paul, and had thus\ncaught the last sentence. “Any better than Mrs. Mudge!” she repeated,\nthoroughly provoked. “So you've been talking about me, you trollop, have\nyou? I'll come up with you, you may depend upon that. That's to pay for\nmy giving you tea Sunday night, is it? Perhaps you'll get some more.\nIt's pretty well in paupers conspiring together because they aint\ntreated like princes and princesses. Perhaps you'd like to got boarded\nwith Queen Victoria.”\n\nThe old lady sat very quiet during this tirade. She had been the subject\nof similar invective before, and knew that it would do no good to oppose\nMrs. Mudge in her present excited state.\n\n“I don't wonder you haven't anything to say,” said the infuriated dame.\n“I should think you'd want to hide your face in shame, you trollop.”\n\nPaul was not quite so patient as his attendant. Her kindness had\nproduced such an impression on him, that Mrs. Mudge, by her taunts,\nstirred up his indignation.\n\n“She's no more of a trollop than you are,” said he, with spirit.\n\nMrs. Mudge whirled round at this unexpected attack, and shook her fist\nmenacingly at Paul--\n\n“So, you've put in your oar, you little jackanapes,” said she, “If\nyou're well enough to be impudent you're well enough to go to work.\nYou aint a goin' to lie here idle much longer, I can tell you. If\nyou deceive Dr. Townsend, and make him believe you're sick, you can't\ndeceive me. No doubt you feel mighty comfortable, lyin' here with\nnothing to do, while I'm a slavin' myself to death down stairs, waitin'\nupon you; (this was a slight exaggeration, as Aunt Lucy took the entire\ncharge of Paul, including the preparation of his food;) but you'd better\nmake the most of it, for you won't lie here much longer. You'll miss not\nbein' able to talk about me, won't you?”\n\nMrs. Mudge paused a moment as if expecting an answer to her highly\nsarcastic question, but Paul felt that no advantage would be gained by\nsaying more.. He was not naturally a quick-tempered buy, and had only\nbeen led to this little ebullition by the wanton attack by Mrs. Mudge.\n\nThis lady, after standing a moment as if defying the twain to a further\ncontest, went out, slamming the door violently after her.\n\n“You did wrong to provoke her, Paul,” said Aunt Lucy, gravely.\n\n“How could I help it?” asked Paul, earnestly. “If she had only abused\nME, I should not have cared so much, but when she spoke about you, who\nhave been so kind to me, I could not be silent.”\n\n“I thank you, Paul, for your kind feeling,” said the old lady, gently,\n“but we must learn to bear and forbear. The best of us have our faults\nand failings.”\n\n“What are yours, Aunt Lucy?”\n\n“O, a great many.”\n\n“Such as what?”\n\n“I am afraid I am sometimes discontented with the station which God has\nassigned me.”\n\n“I don't think you can be very much to blame for that. I should never\nlearn to be contented here if I lived to the age of Methuselah.”\n\nPaul lay quite still for an hour or more. During that time he formed a\ndetermination which will be announced in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nPAUL'S DETERMINATION\n\nAt the close of the last chapter it was stated that Paul had come to a\ndetermination.\n\nThis was,--TO RUN AWAY.\n\nThat he had good reason for this we have already seen.\n\nHe was now improving rapidly, and only waited till he was well enough to\nput his design into execution.\n\n“Aunt Lucy,” said he one day, “I've got something to tell you.”\n\nThe old lady looked up inquiringly.\n\n“It's something I've been thinking of a long time,--at least most of the\ntime since I've been sick. It isn't pleasant for me to stay here, and\nI've pretty much made up my mind that I sha'n't.”\n\n“Where will you go?” asked the old lady, dropping her work in surprise.\n\n“I don't know of any particular place, but I should be better off most\nanywhere than here.”\n\n“But you are so young, Paul.”\n\n“God will take care of me, Aunt Lucy,--mother used to tell me that.\nBesides, here I have no hope of learning anything or improving my\ncondition. Then again, if I stay here, I can never do what father wished\nme to do.”\n\n“What is that, Paul?”\n\nPaul told the story of his father's indebtedness to Squire Conant, and\nthe cruel letter which the Squire had written.\n\n“I mean to pay that debt,” he concluded firmly. “I won't let anybody say\nthat my father kept them out of their money. There is no chance here;\nsomewhere else I may find work and money.”\n\n“It is a great undertaking for a boy like you, Paul,” said Aunt Lucy,\nthoughtfully. “To whom is the money due?”\n\n“Squire Conant of Cedarville.”\n\nAunt Lucy seemed surprised and agitated by the mention of this name.\n\n“Paul,” said she, “Squire Conant is my brother.”\n\n“Your brother!” repeated he in great surprise. “Then why does he allow\nyou to live here? He is rich enough to take care of you.”\n\n“It is a long story,” said the old lady, sadly. “All that you will be\ninterested to know is that I married against the wishes of my family. My\nhusband died and I was left destitute. My brother has never noticed me\nsince.”\n\n“It is a great shame,” said Paul.\n\n“We won't judge him, Paul. Have you fixed upon any time to go?”\n\n“I shall wait a few days till I get stronger. Can you tell me how far it\nis to New York?”\n\n“O, a great distance; a hundred miles at least. You can't think of going\nso far as that?”\n\n“I think it would be the best plan,” said Paul. “In a great city like\nNew York there must be a great many things to do which I can't do here.\nI don't feel strong enough to work on a farm. Besides, I don't like it.\nO, it must be a fine thing to live in a great city. Then too,” pursued\nPaul, his face lighting up with the hopeful confidence of youth, “I\nmay become rich. If I do, Aunt Lucy, I will build a fine house, and you\nshall come and live with me.”\n\nAunt Lucy had seen more of life than Paul, and was less sanguine. The\nthought came to her that her life was already declining while his was\nbut just begun, and in the course of nature, even if his bright dreams\nshould be realized, she could hardly hope to live long enough to see it.\nBut of this she said nothing. She would not for the world have dimmed\nthe brightness of his anticipations by the expression of a single doubt.\n\n“I wish you all success, Paul, and I thank you for wishing me to share\nin your good fortune. God helps those who help themselves, and he will\nhelp you if you only deserve it. I shall miss you very much when you are\ngone. It will seem more lonely than ever.”\n\n“If it were not for you, Aunt Lucy, I should not mind going at all, but\nI shall be sorry to leave you behind.”\n\n“God will care for both of us, my dear boy. I shall hope to hear from\nyou now and then, and if I learn that you are prosperous and happy, I\nshall be better contented with my own lot. But have you thought of all\nthe labor and weariness that you will have to encounter? It is best to\nconsider well all this, before entering upon such an undertaking.”\n\n“I have thought of all that, and if there were any prospect of my being\nhappy here, I might stay for the present. But you know how Mrs. Mudge\nhas treated me, and how she feels towards me now.”\n\n“I acknowledge, Paul, that it has proved a hard apprenticeship, and\nperhaps it might be made yet harder if you should stay longer. You must\nlet me know when you are going, I shall want to bid you good-by.”\n\n“No fear that I shall forget that, Aunt Lucy. Next to my mother you have\nbeen most kind to me, and I love you for it.”\n\nLightly pressing her lips to Paul's forehead Aunt Lucy left the room to\nconceal the emotion called forth by his approaching departure. Of all\nthe inmates of the establishment she had felt most closely drawn to the\norphan boy, whose loneliness and bereavement had appealed to her woman's\nheart. This feeling had been strengthened by the care she had been\ncalled to bestow upon him in his illness, for it is natural to love\nthose whom we have benefited. But Aunt Lucy was the most unselfish of\nliving creatures, and the idea of dissuading Paul from a course which he\nfelt was right never occurred to her. She determined that she would\ndo what she could to further his plans, now that he had decided to go.\nAccordingly she commenced knitting him a pair of stockings, knowing that\nthis would prove a useful present. This came near being the means of\ndiscovering Paul's plan to Mrs. Mudge The latter, who notwithstanding\nher numerous duties, managed to see everything that was going on, had\nher attention directed to Aunt Lucy's work.\n\n“Have you finished the stockings that I set you to knitting for Mr.\nMudge?” she asked.\n\n“No,” said Aunt Lucy, in some confusion.\n\n“Then whose are those, I should like to know? Somebody of more\nimportance than my husband, I suppose.”\n\n“They are for Paul,” returned the old lady, in some uneasiness.\n\n“Paul!” repeated Mrs. Mudge, in her haste putting a double quantity\nof salaeratus into the bread she was mixing; “Paul's are they? And who\nasked you to knit him a pair, I should like to be informed?”\n\n“No one.”\n\n“Then what are you doing it for?”\n\n“I thought he might want them.”\n\n“Mighty considerate, I declare. And I shouldn't be at all surprised\nif you were knitting them with the yarn I gave you for Mr. Mudge's\nstockings.”\n\n“You are mistaken,” said Aunt Lucy, shortly.\n\n“Oh, you're putting on your airs, are you? I'll tell you what, Madam,\nyou'd better put those stockings away in double-quick time, and finish\nmy husband's, or I'll throw them into the fire, and Paul Prescott may\nwait till he goes barefoot before he gets them.”\n\nThere was no alternative. Aunt Lucy was obliged to obey, at least while\nher persecutor was in the room. When alone for any length of time she\ntook out Paul's stockings from under her apron, and worked on them till\nthe approaching steps of Mrs. Mudge warned her to desist.\n\n*****\n\n\nThree days passed. The shadows of twilight were already upon the earth.\nThe paupers were collected in the common room appropriated to their use.\nAunt Lucy had suspended her work in consequence of the darkness, for\nin this economical household a lamp was considered a useless piece of\nextravagance. Paul crept quietly to her side, and whispered in tones\naudible to her alone, “I AM GOING TO-MORROW.”\n\n“To-morrow! so soon?”\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, “I am as ready now as I shall ever be. I wanted to\ntell you, because I thought maybe you might like to know that this is\nthe last evening we shall spend together at present.”\n\n“Do you go in the morning?”\n\n“Yes, Aunt Lucy, early in the morning. Mr. Mudge usually calls me at\nfive; I must be gone an hour before that time. I suppose I must bid you\ngood-by to-night.”\n\n“Not to-night, Paul; I shall be up in the morning to see you go.”\n\n“But if Mrs. Mudge finds it out she will abuse you.”\n\n“I am used to that, Paul,” said Aunt Lucy, with a sorrowful smile. “I\nhave borne it many times, and I can again. But I can't lie quiet and let\nyou go without one word of parting. You are quite determined to go?”\n\n“Quite, Aunt Lucy. I never could stay here. There is no pleasure in the\npresent, and no hope for the future. I want to see something of life,”\n and Paul's boyish figure dilated with enthusiasm.\n\n“God grant that you do not see too much!” said Aunt Lucy, half to\nherself.\n\n“Is the world then, so very sad a place?” asked Paul.\n\n“Both joy and sorrow are mingled in the cup of human life,” said Aunt\nLucy, solemnly:\n\n“Which shall preponderate it is partly in our power to determine. He\nwho follows the path of duty steadfastly, cannot be wholly miserable,\nwhatever misfortunes may come upon him. He will be sustained by the\nconviction that his own errors have not brought them upon him.”\n\n“I will try to do right,” said Paul, placing his hand in that of his\ncompanion, “and if ever I am tempted to do wrong, I will think of you\nand of my mother, and that thought shall restrain me.”\n\n“It's time to go bed, folks,” proclaimed Mrs Mudge, appearing at the\ndoor. “I can't have you sitting up all night, as I've no doubt you'd\nlike to do.”\n\nIt was only eight o'clock, but no one thought of interposing an\nobjection. The word of Mrs. Mudge was law in her household, as even her\nhusband was sometimes made aware.\n\nAll quietly rose from their seats and repaired to bed. It was an\naffecting sight to watch the tottering gait of those on whose heads the\nsnows of many winters had drifted heavily, as they meekly obeyed the\nbehest of one whose coarse nature forbade her sympathizing with them in\ntheir clouded age, and many infirmities.\n\n“Come,” said she, impatient of their slow movements, “move a little\nquicker, if it's perfectly convenient. Anybody'd think you'd been hard\nat work all day, as I have. You're about the laziest set I ever had\nanything to do with. I've got to be up early in the morning, and can't\nstay here dawdling.”\n\n“She's got a sweet temper,” said Paul, in a whisper, to Aunt Lucy.\n\n“Hush!” said the old lady. “She may hear you.”\n\n“What's that you're whispering about?” said Mrs. Mudge, suspiciously.\n“Something you're ashamed to have heard, most likely.”\n\nPaul thought it best to remain silent.\n\n“To-morrow morning at four!” he whispered to Aunt Lucy, as he pressed\nher hand in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nPAUL BEGINS HIS JOURNEY.\n\n\nPaul ascended the stairs to his hard pallet for the last time. For the\nlast time! There is sadness in the thought, even when the future which\nlies before us glows with brighter colors than the past has ever worn.\nBut to Paul, whose future was veiled in uncertainty, and who was about\nto part with the only friend who felt an interest in his welfare, this\nthought brought increased sorrow.\n\nHe stood before the dirt-begrimed window through which alone the\nstruggling sunbeams found an inlet into the gloomy little attic,\nand looked wistfully out upon the barren fields that surrounded the\npoorhouse. Where would he be on the morrow at that time? He did not\nknow. He knew little or nothing of the great world without, yet his\nresolution did not for an instant falter. If it had, the thought of Mrs.\nMudge would have been enough to remove all his hesitation.\n\nHe threw himself on his hard bed, and a few minutes brought him that\ndreamless sleep which comes so easily to the young.\n\nMeanwhile Aunt Lucy, whose thoughts were also occupied with Paul's\napproaching departure, had taken from the pocket of her OTHER dress--for\nshe had but two--something wrapped in a piece of brown paper. One by one\nshe removed the many folds in which it was enveloped, and came at length\nto the contents.\n\nIt was a coin.\n\n“Paul will need some money, poor boy,” said she, softly to herself, “I\nwill give him this. It will never do me any good, and it may be of some\nservice to him.”\n\nSo saying she looked carefully at the coin in the moonlight.\n\nBut what made her start, and utter a half exclamation?\n\nInstead of the gold eagle, the accumulation of many years, which she had\nbeen saving for some extraordinary occasion like the presents she held\nin her hand--a copper cent.\n\n“I have been robbed,” she exclaimed indignantly in the suddenness of her\nsurprise.\n\n“What's the matter now?” inquired Mrs Mudge, appearing at the door, “Why\nare you not in bed, Aunt Lucy Lee? How dare you disobey my orders?”\n\n“I have been robbed,” exclaimed the old lady in unwonted excitement.\n\n“Of what, pray?” asked Mrs. Mudge, with a sneer.\n\n“I had a gold eagle wrapped up in that paper,” returned Aunt Lucy,\npointing to the fragments on the floor, “and now, to-night, when I come\nto open it, I find but this cent.”\n\n“A likely story,” retorted Mrs. Mudge, “very likely, indeed, that a\ncommon pauper should have a gold eagle. If you found a cent in the\npaper, most likely that's what you put there. You're growing old and\nforgetful, so don't get foolish and flighty. You'd better go to bed.”\n\n“But I did have the gold, and it's been stolen,” persisted Aunt Lucy,\nwhose disappointment was the greater because she intended the money for\nPaul.\n\n“Again!” exclaimed Mrs. Mudge. “Will you never have done with this\nfolly? Even if you did have the gold, which I don't for an instant\nbelieve, you couldn't keep it. A pauper has no right to hold property.”\n\n“Then why did the one who stole the little I had leave me this?” said\nthe old lady, scornfully, holding up the cent which had been substituted\nfor the gold.\n\n“How should I know?” exclaimed Mrs. Mudge, wrathfully. “You talk as if\nyou thought I had taken your trumpery money.”\n\n“So you did!” chimed in an unexpected voice, which made Mrs. Mudge start\nnervously.\n\nIt was the young woman already mentioned, who was bereft of reason,\nbut who at times, as often happens in such cases, seemed gifted with\npreternatural acuteness.\n\n“So you did. I saw you, I did; I saw you creep up when you thought\nnobody was looking, and search her pocket. You opened that paper and\ntook out the bright yellow piece, and put in another. You didn't think I\nwas looking at you, ha! ha! How I laughed as I stood behind the door and\nsaw you tremble for fear some one would catch you thieving. You didn't\nthink of me, dear, did you?”\n\nAnd the wild creature burst into an unmeaning laugh.\n\nMrs. Mudge stood for a moment mute, overwhelmed by this sudden\nrevelation. But for the darkness, Aunt Lucy could have seen the sudden\nflush which overspread her face with the crimson hue of detected guilt.\nBut this was only for a moment. It was quickly succeeded by a feeling\nof intense anger towards the unhappy creature who had been the means of\nexposing her.\n\n“I'll teach you to slander your betters, you crazy fool,” she exclaimed,\nin a voice almost inarticulate with passion, as she seized her rudely by\nthe arm, and dragged her violently from the room.\n\nShe returned immediately.\n\n“I suppose,” said she, abruptly, confronting Aunt Lucy, “that you are\nfool enough to believe her ravings?”\n\n“I bring no accusation,” said the old lady, calmly, “If your conscience\nacquits you, it is not for me to accuse you.”\n\n“But what do you think?” persisted Mrs. Mudge, whose consciousness of\nguilt did not leave her quite at ease.\n\n“I cannot read the heart,” said Aunt Lucy, composedly. “I can only say,\nthat, pauper as I am, I would not exchange places with the one who has\ndone this deed.”\n\n“Do you mean me?” demanded Mrs. Mudge.\n\n“You can tell best.”\n\n“I tell you what, Aunt Lucy Lee,” said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes blazing\nwith anger, “If you dare insinuate to any living soul that I stole your\npaltry money, which I don't believe you ever had, I will be bitterly\nrevenged upon you.”\n\nShe flaunted out of the room, and Aunt Lucy, the first bitterness of her\ndisappointment over, retired to bed, and slept more tranquilly than the\nunscrupulous woman who had robbed her.\n\nAt a quarter before four Paul started from his humble couch, and hastily\ndressed himself, took up a little bundle containing all his scanty stock\nof clothing, and noiselessly descended the two flights of stairs which\nseparated him from the lower story. Here he paused a moment for Aunt\nLucy to appear. Her sharp ears had distinguished his stealthy steps as\nhe passed her door, and she came down to bid him good-by. She had in her\nhands a pair of stockings which she slipped into his bundle.\n\n“I wish I had something else to give you, Paul,” she said, “but you know\nthat I am not very rich.”\n\n“Dear Aunt Lucy,” said Paul, kissing her, “you are my only friend on\nearth. You have been very kind to me, and I never will forget you,\nNEVER! By-and-by, when I am rich, I will build a fine house, and you\nwill come and live with me, won't you?”\n\nPaul's bright anticipations, improbable as they were, had the effect of\nturning his companion's thoughts into a more cheerful channel.\n\nShe bent down and kissed him, whispering softly, “Yes, I will, Paul.”\n\n“Then it's a bargain,” said he, joyously, “Mind you don't forget it. I\nshall come for you one of these days when you least expect it.”\n\n“Have you any money?” inquired Aunt Lucy.\n\nPaul shook his head.\n\n“Then,” said she, drawing from her finger a gold ring which had held\nits place for many long years, “here is something which will bring you a\nlittle money if you are ever in distress.”\n\nPaul hung back.\n\n“I would rather not take it, indeed I would,” he said, earnestly,\n“I would rather go hungry for two or three days than sell your ring.\nBesides, I shall not need it; God will provide for me.”\n\n“But you need not sell it,” urged Aunt Lucy, “unless it is absolutely\nnecessary. You can take it and keep it in remembrance of me. Keep it\ntill you see me again, Paul. It will be a pledge to me that you will\ncome back again some day.”\n\n“On that condition I will take it,” said Paul, “and some day I will\nbring it back.”\n\nA slight noise above, as of some one stirring in sleep, excited the\napprehensions of the two, and warned them that it was imprudent for them\nto remain longer in conversation.\n\nAfter a hurried good-by, Aunt Lucy quietly went upstairs again, and\nPaul, shouldering his bundle, walked rapidly away.\n\nThe birds, awakening from their night's repose, were beginning to carol\nforth their rich songs of thanksgiving for the blessing of a new day.\nFrom the flowers beneath his feet and the blossom-laden branches above\nhis head, a delicious perfume floated out upon the morning air, and\nfilled the heart of the young wanderer with a sense of the joyousness of\nexistence, and inspired him with a hopeful confidence in the future.\n\nFor the first time he felt that he belonged to himself. At the age of\nthirteen he had taken his fortune in his own hand, and was about to mold\nit as best he might.\n\nThere were care, and toil, and privations before him, no doubt, but\nin that bright morning hour he could harbor only cheerful and trusting\nthoughts. Hopefully he looked forward to the time when he could fulfil\nhis father's dying injunction, and lift from his name the burden of a\ndebt unpaid. Then his mind reverting to another thought, he could not\nhelp smiling at the surprise and anger of Mr. Mudge, when he should find\nthat his assistant had taken French leave. He thought he should like to\nbe concealed somewhere where he could witness the commotion excited\nby his own departure. But as he could not be in two places at the same\ntime, he must lose that satisfaction. He had cut loose from the Mudge\nhousehold, as he trusted, forever. He felt that a new and brighter life\nwas opening before him.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nA FRIEND IN NEED.\n\n\nOur hero did not stop till he had put a good five miles between himself\nand the poorhouse. He knew that it would not be long before Mr. Mudge\nwould discover his absence, and the thought of being carried back was\ndoubly distasteful to him now that he had, even for a short time, felt\nthe joy of being his own master. His hurried walk, taken in the fresh\nmorning air, gave him quite a sharp appetite. Luckily he had the means\nof gratifying it. The night before he had secreted half his supper,\nknowing that he should need it more the next morning. He thought he\nmight now venture to sit down and eat it.\n\nAt a little distance from the road was a spring, doubtless used for\ncattle, since it was situated at the lower end of a pasture. Close\nbeside and bending over it was a broad, branching oak, which promised a\ncool and comfortable shelter.\n\n“That's just the place for me,” thought Paul, who felt thirsty as well\nas hungry, “I think I will take breakfast here and rest awhile before I\ngo any farther.”\n\nSo saying he leaped lightly over the rail fence, and making his way to\nthe place indicated, sat down in the shadow of the tree. Scooping up\nsome water in the hollow of his hand, he drank a deep and refreshing\ndraught. He next proceeded to pull out of his pocket a small package,\nwhich proved to contain two small pieces of bread. His long morning walk\nhad given him such an appetite that he was not long in despatching all\nhe had. It is said by some learned physicians, who no doubt understand\nthe matter, that we should always rise from the table with an appetite.\nProbably Paul had never heard of this rule. Nevertheless, he seemed in\na fair way of putting it into practice, for the best of reasons, because\nhe could not help it.\n\nHis breakfast, though not the most inviting, being simply unbuttered\nbread and rather dry at that, seemed more delicious than ever before,\nbut unfortunately there was not enough of it. However, as there seemed\nlikely to be no more forthcoming, he concluded in default of breakfast\nto lie down under the tree for a few minutes before resuming his walk.\nThough he could not help wondering vaguely where his dinner was to come\nfrom, as that time was several hours distant, he wisely decided not to\nanticipate trouble till it came.\n\nLying down under the tree, Paul began to consider what Mr. Mudge would\nsay when he discovered that he had run away.\n\n“He'll have to milk the cows himself,” thought Paul. “He won't fancy\nthat much. Won't Mrs. Mudge scold, thought? I'm glad I shan't be within\nhearing.”\n\n“Holloa!”\n\nIt was a boy's voice that Paul heard.\n\nLooking up he saw a sedate company of cows entering the pasture single\nfile through an aperture made by letting down the bars. Behind them\nwalked a boy of about his own size, flourishing a stout hickory stick.\nThe cows went directly to the spring from which Paul had already drunk.\nThe young driver looked at our hero with some curiosity, wondering,\ndoubtless, what brought him there so early in the morning. After a\nlittle hesitation he said, remarking Paul's bundle, “Where are you\ntraveling?”\n\n“I don't know exactly,” said Paul, who was not quite sure whether it\nwould be politic to avow his destination.\n\n“Don't know?” returned the other, evidently surprised.\n\n“Not exactly; I may go to New York.”\n\n“New York! That's a great ways off. Do you know the way there?”\n\n“No, but I can find it.”\n\n“Are you going all alone?” asked his new acquaintance, who evidently\nthought Paul had undertaken a very formidable journey.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Are you going to walk all the way?”\n\n“Yes, unless somebody offers me a ride now and then.”\n\n“But why don't you ride in the stage, or in the cars? You would get\nthere a good deal quicker.”\n\n“One reason,” said Paul, hesitating a little, “is because I have no\nmoney to pay for riding.”\n\n“Then how do you expect to live? Have you had any breakfast, this\nmorning?”\n\n“I brought some with me, and just got through eating it when you came\nalong.”\n\n“And where do you expect to get any dinner?” pursued his questioner, who\nwas evidently not a little puzzled by the answers he received.\n\n“I don't know,” returned Paul.\n\nHis companion looked not a little confounded at this view of the matter,\nbut presently a bright thought struck him.\n\n“I shouldn't wonder,” he said, shrewdly, “if you were running away.”\n\nPaul hesitated a moment. He knew that his case must look a little\nsuspicious, thus unexplained, and after a brief pause for reflection\ndetermined to take the questioner into his confidence. He did this the\nmore readily because his new acquaintance looked very pleasant.\n\n“You've guessed right,” he said; “if you'll promise not to tell anybody,\nI'll tell you all about it.”\n\nThis was readily promised, and the boy who gave his name as John\nBurgess, sat down beside Paul, while he, with the frankness of\nboyhood, gave a circumstantial account of his father's death, and the\nill-treatment he had met with subsequently.\n\n“Do you come from Wrenville?” asked John, interested. “Why, I've got\nrelations there. Perhaps you know my cousin, Ben Newcome.”\n\n“Is Ben Newcome your cousin? O yes, I know him very well; he's a\nfirst-rate fellow.”\n\n“He isn't much like his father.”\n\n“Not at all. If he was”--\n\n“You wouldn't like him so well. Uncle talks a little too much out of\nthe dictionary, and walks so straight that he bends backward. But I say,\nPaul, old Mudge deserves to be choked, and Mrs. Mudge should be obliged\nto swallow a gallon of her own soup. I don't know but that would be\nworse than choking. I wouldn't have stayed so long if I had been in your\nplace.”\n\n“I shouldn't,” said Paul, “if it hadn't been for Aunt Lucy.”\n\n“Was she an aunt of yours?”\n\n“No, but we used to call her so, She's the best friend I've got, and I\ndon't know but the only one,” said Paul, a little sadly.\n\n“No, she isn't,” said John, quickly; “I'll be your friend, Paul.\nSometime, perhaps, I shall go to New York, myself, and then I will come\nand see you. Where do you expect to be?”\n\n“I don't know anything about the city,” said Paul, “but if you come, I\nshall be sure to see you somewhere. I wish you were going now.”\n\nNeither Paul nor his companion had much idea of the extent of the great\nmetropolis, or they would not have taken it so much as a matter of\ncourse that, being in the same place, they should meet each other.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from a\nfarmhouse within sight.\n\n“That's our breakfast-bell,” said John rising from the grass. “It is\nmeant for me. I suppose they wonder what keeps me so long. Won't you\ncome and take breakfast with me, Paul?”\n\n“I guess not,” said Paul, who would have been glad to do so had he\nfollowed the promptings of his appetite. “I'm afraid your folks would\nask me questions, and then it would be found out that I am running\naway.”\n\n“I didn't think of that,” returned John, after a pause. “You haven't got\nany dinner with you?” he said a moment after.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. Come with me as far as the fence, and\nlie down there till I've finished breakfast. Then I'll bring something\nout for you, and maybe I'll walk along a little way with you.”\n\n“You are very kind,” said Paul, gratefully.\n\n“Oh, nonsense,” said John, “that's nothing. Besides, you know we are\ngoing to be friends.”\n\n“John! breakfast's ready.”\n\n“There's Nelson calling me,” said John, hurriedly. “I must leave you;\nthere's the fence; lie down there, and I'll be back in a jiffy.”\n\n“John, I say, why don't you come?”\n\n“I'm coming. You mustn't think everybody's got such a thundering great\nappetite as you, Nelson.”\n\n“I guess you've got enough to keep you from pining away,” said Nelson,\ngood-naturedly, “you're twice as fat as I am.”\n\n“That's because I work harder,” said John, rather illogically.\n\nThe brothers went in to breakfast.\n\nBut a few minutes elapsed before John reappeared, bearing under his arm\na parcel wrapped up in an old newspaper. He came up panting with the\nhaste he had made.\n\n“It didn't take you long to eat breakfast,” said Paul.\n\n“No, I hurried through it; I thought you would get tired of waiting. And\nnow I'll walk along with you a little ways. But wait here's something\nfor you.”\n\nSo saying he unrolled the newspaper and displayed a loaf of bread,\nfresh and warm, which looked particularly inviting to Paul, whose scanty\nbreakfast had by no means satisfied his appetite. Besides this, there\nwas a loaf of molasses ginger-bread, with which all who were born in the\ncountry, or know anything of New England housekeeping, are familiar.\n\n“There,” said John, “I guess that'll be enough for your dinner.”\n\n“But how did you get it without having any questions asked?” inquired\nour hero.\n\n“Oh,” said John, “I asked mother for them, and when she asked what I\nwanted of them, I told her that I'd answer that question to-morrow.\nYou see I wanted to give you a chance to get off out of the way, though\nmother wouldn't tell, even if she knew.”\n\n“All right,” said Paul, with satisfaction.\n\nHe could not help looking wistfully at the bread, which looked very\ninviting to one accustomed to poorhouse fare.\n\n“If you wouldn't mind,” he said hesitating, “I would like to eat a\nlittle of the bread now.”\n\n“Mind, of course not,” said John, breaking off a liberal slice. “Why\ndidn't I think of that before? Walking must have given you a famous\nappetite.”\n\nJohn looked on with evident approbation, while Paul ate with great\napparent appetite.\n\n“There,” said he with a sigh of gratification, as he swallowed the last\nmorsel, “I haven't tasted anything so good for a long time.”\n\n“Is it as good as Mrs. Mudge's soup?” asked John, mischievously.\n\n“Almost,” returned Paul, smiling.\n\nWe must now leave the boys to pursue their way, and return to the\ndwelling from which our hero had so unceremoniously taken his departure,\nand from which danger now threatened him.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nA CLOUD IN THE MUDGE HORIZON.\n\n\nMr. Mudge was accustomed to call Paul at five o'clock, to milk the cows\nand perform other chores. He himself did not rise till an hour later.\nDuring Paul's sickness, he was obliged to take his place,--a thing he\ndid not relish overmuch. Now that our hero had recovered, he gladly\nprepared to indulge himself in an extra nap.\n\n“Paul!” called Mr. Mudge from the bottom of the staircase leading up\ninto the attic, “it's five o'clock; time you were downstairs.”\n\nMr. Mudge waited for an answer, but none came.\n\n“Paul!” repeated Mr. Mudge in a louder tone, “it's time to get up;\ntumble out there.”\n\nAgain there was no answer.\n\nAt first, Mr. Mudge thought it might be in consequence of Paul's\nsleeping so soundly, but on listening attentively, he could not\ndistinguish the deep and regular breathing which usually accompanies\nsuch slumber.\n\n“He must be sullen,” he concluded, with a feeling of irritation. “If he\nis, I'll teach him----”\n\nWithout taking time to finish the sentence, he bounded up the rickety\nstaircase, and turned towards the bed with the intention of giving our\nhero a smart shaking.\n\nHe looked with astonishment at the empty bed. “Is it possible,” he\nthought, “that Paul has already got up? He isn't apt to do so before he\nis called.”\n\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Mudge, surprised at her husband's prolonged\nabsence, called from below, “Mr. Mudge!”\n\n“Well, wife?”\n\n“What in the name of wonder keeps you up there so long?”\n\n“Just come up and see.”\n\nMrs. Mudge did come up. Her husband pointed to the empty bed.\n\n“What do you think of that?” he asked.\n\n“What about it?” she inquired, not quite comprehending.\n\n“About that boy, Paul. When I called him I got no answer, so I came up,\nand behold he is among the missing.”\n\n“You don't think he's run away, do you?” asked Mrs. Mudge startled.\n\n“That is more than I know.”\n\n“I'll see if his clothes are here,” said his wife, now fully aroused.\n\nHer search was unavailing. Paul's clothes had disappeared as\nmysteriously as their owner.\n\n“It's a clear case,” said Mr. Mudge, shaking his head; “he's gone.\nI wouldn't have lost him for considerable. He was only a boy, but I\nmanaged to get as much work out of him as a man. The question is now,\nwhat shall we do about it?”\n\n“He must be pursued,” said Mrs. Mudge, with vehemence, “I'll have him\nback if it costs me twenty dollars. I'll tell you what, husband,” she\nexclaimed, with a sudden light breaking in upon her, “if there's anybody\nin this house knows where he's gone, it is Aunt Lucy Lee. Only last week\nI caught her knitting him a pair of stockings. I might have known what\nit meant if I hadn't been a fool.”\n\n“Ha, ha! So you might, if you hadn't been a fool!” echoed a mocking\nvoice.\n\nTurning with sudden anger, Mrs. Mudge beheld the face of the crazy girl\npeering up at her from below.\n\nThis turned her thoughts into a different channel.\n\n“I'll teach you what I am,” she exclaimed, wrathfully descending the\nstairs more rapidly than she had mounted them, “and if you know anything\nabout the little scamp, I'll have it out of you.”\n\nThe girl narrowly succeeded in eluding the grasp of her pursuer. But,\nalas! for Mrs. Mudge. In her impetuosity she lost her footing, and fell\nbackward into a pail of water which had been brought up the night before\nand set in the entry for purposes of ablution. More wrathful than ever,\nMrs. Mudge bounced into her room and sat down in her dripping garments\nin a very uncomfortable frame of mind. As for Paul, she felt a personal\ndislike for him, and was not sorry on some accounts to have him out of\nthe house. The knowledge, however, that he had in a manner defied her\nauthority by running away, filled her with an earnest desire to get him\nback, if only to prove that it was not to be defied with impunity.\n\nHoping to elicit some information from Aunt Lucy, who, she felt sure,\nwas in Paul's confidence, she paid her a visit.\n\n“Well, here's a pretty goings on,” she commenced, abruptly. Finding that\nAunt Lucy manifested no curiosity on the subject, she continued, in a\nsignificant tone, “Of course, YOU don't know anything about it.”\n\n“I can tell better when I know what you refer to,” said the old lady\ncalmly.\n\n“Oh, you are very ignorant all at once. I suppose you didn't know Paul\nPrescott had run away?”\n\n“I am not surprised,” said the old lady, in the same quiet manner.\n\nMrs. Mudge had expected a show of astonishment, and this calmness\ndisconcerted her.\n\n“You are not surprised!” she retorted. “I presume not, since you\nknew all about it beforehand. That's why you were knitting him some\nstockings. Deny it, if you dare.”\n\n“I have no disposition to deny it.”\n\n“You haven't!” exclaimed the questioner, almost struck dumb with this\naudacity.\n\n“No,” said Aunt Lucy. “Why should I? There was no particular inducement\nfor him to stay here. Wherever he goes, I hope he will meet with good\nfriends and good treatment.”\n\n“As much as to say he didn't find them here. Is that what you mean?”\n\n“I have no charges to bring.”\n\n“But I have,” said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes lighting with malicious\nsatisfaction. “Last night you missed a ten-dollar gold piece, which you\nsaw was stolen from you. This morning it appears that Paul Prescott has\nrun away. I charge him with the theft.”\n\n“You do not, can not believe this,” said the old lady, uneasily.\n\n“Of course I do,” returned Mrs. Mudge, triumphantly, perceiving her\nadvantage. “I have no doubt of it, and when we get the boy back, he\nshall be made to confess it.”\n\nAunt Lucy looked troubled, much to the gratification of Mrs. Mudge.\nIt was but for a short time, however. Rising from her seat, she stood\nconfronting Mrs. Mudge, and said quietly, but firmly, “I have no doubt,\nMrs. Mudge, you are capable of doing what you say. I would advise you,\nhowever, to pause. You know, as well as I do, that Paul is incapable\nof this theft. Even if he were wicked enough to form the idea, he would\nhave no need, since it was my intention to GIVE him this money. Who did\nactually steal the gold, you PERHAPS know better than I. Should it be\nnecessary, I shall not hesitate to say so. I advise you not to render it\nnecessary.”\n\nThe threat which lay in these words was understood. It came with the\nforce of a sudden blow to Mrs. Mudge, who had supposed it would be no\ndifficult task to frighten and silence Aunt Lucy. The latter had always\nbeen so yielding in all matters relating to herself, that this intrepid\nchampionship of Paul's interests was unlooked for. The tables were\ncompletely turned. Pale with rage, and a mortified sense of having been\nfoiled with her own weapons, Mrs. Mudge left the room.\n\nMeanwhile her husband milked the cows, and was now occupied in\nperforming certain other duties that could not be postponed, being\nresolved, immediately after breakfast was over, to harness up and pursue\nthe runaway.\n\n“Well, did you get anything out of the old lady?” he inquired, as he\ncame from the barn with the full milk-pails.\n\n“She said she knew beforehand that he was going.”\n\n“Eh!” said Mr. Mudge, pricking up his ears, “did she say where?”\n\n“No, and she won't. She knit him a pair of stockings to help him off,\nand doesn't pretend to deny it. She's taken a wonderful fancy to the\nyoung scamp, and has been as obstinate as could be ever since he has\nbeen here.”\n\n“If I get him back,” said Mr. Mudge, “he shall have a good flogging, if\nI am able to give him one, and she shall be present to see it.”\n\n“That's right,” said Mrs. Mudge, approvingly, “when are you going to set\nout after him?”\n\n“Right after breakfast. So be spry, and get it ready as soon as you\ncan.”\n\nUnder the stimulus of this inspiring motive, Mrs. Mudge bustled about\nwith new energy, and before many minutes the meal was in readiness.\nIt did not take long to dispatch it. Immediately afterwards, Mr. Mudge\nharnessed up, as he had determined, and started off in pursuit of our\nhero.\n\n\nIn the meantime the two boys had walked leisurely along, conversing on\nvarious subjects.\n\n“When you get to the city, Paul,” said John, “I shall want to hear from\nyou. Will you write to me?”\n\nPaul promised readily.\n\n“You can direct to John Burges, Burrville. The postmaster knows me, and\nI shall be sure to get it.”\n\n“I wish you were going with me,” said Paul.\n\n“Sometimes when I think that I am all alone it discourages me. It would\nbe so much pleasanter to have some one with me.”\n\n“I shall come sometime,” said John, “when I am a little older. I heard\nfather say something the other day about my going into a store in the\ncity. So we may meet again.”\n\n“I hope we shall.”\n\nThey were just turning a bend of the road, when Paul chanced to look\nbackward. About a quarter of a mile back he descried a horse and wagon\nwearing a familiar look. Fixing his eyes anxiously upon them, he was\nsoon made aware that his suspicions were only too well founded. It was\nMr. Mudge, doubtless in quest of him.\n\n“What shall I do?” he asked, hurriedly of his companion.\n\n“What's the matter?”\n\nThis was quickly explained.\n\nJohn was quickwitted, and he instantly decided upon the course proper\nto be pursued. On either side of the road was a growth of underbrush so\nthick as to be almost impenetrable.\n\n“Creep in behind there, and be quick about it,” directed John, “there is\nno time to lose.”\n\n“There,” said he, after Paul had followed his advice, “if he can see you\nnow he must have sharp eyes.”\n\n“Won't you come in too?”\n\n“Not I,” said John, “I am anxious to see this Mr. Mudge, since you have\ntold me so much about him. I hope he will ask me some questions.”\n\n“What will you tell him?”\n\n“Trust me for that. Don't say any more. He's close by.”\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nMR. MUDGE MEETS HIS MATCH.\n\n\nJohn lounged along, appearing to be very busily engaged in making a\nwhistle from a slip of willow which he had a short time before cut from\nthe tree. He purposely kept in the middle of the road, apparently quite\nunaware of the approach of the vehicle, until he was aroused by the\nsound of a voice behind him.\n\n“Be a little more careful, if you don't want to get run over.”\n\nJohn assumed a look of surprise, and with comic terror ran to the side\nof the road.\n\nMr. Mudge checked his horse, and came to a sudden halt.\n\n“I say, youngster, haven't you seen a boy of about your own size walking\nalong, with a bundle in his hand?”\n\n“Tied up in a red cotton handkerchief?” inquired John.\n\n“Yes, I believe so,” said Mr. Mudge, eagerly, “where did you----”\n\n“With a blue cloth cap?”\n\n“Yes, where----”\n\n“Gray jacket and pants?”\n\n“Yes, yes. Where?”\n\n“With a patch on one knee?”\n\n“Yes, the very one. When did you see him?” said Mr. Mudge, getting ready\nto start his horse.\n\n“Perhaps it isn't the one you mean,” continued John, who took a\nmischievous delight in playing with the evident impatience of Mr. Mudge;\n“the boy that I saw looked thin, as if he hadn't had enough to eat.”\n\nMr. Mudge winced slightly, and looked at John with some suspicion.\nBut John put on so innocent and artless a look that Mr. Mudge at once\ndismissed the idea that there was any covert meaning in what he said.\nMeanwhile Paul, from his hiding-place in the bushes, had listened with\nanxiety to the foregoing colloquy. When John described his appearance so\nminutely, he was seized with a sudden apprehension that the boy meant\nto betray him. But he dismissed it instantly. In his own singleness of\nheart he could not believe such duplicity possible. Still, it was not\nwithout anxiety that he waited to hear what would be said next.\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Mudge, slowly, “I don't know but he is a little PEAKED.\nHe's been sick lately, and that's took off his flesh.”\n\n“Was he your son?” asked John, in a sympathizing tone; “you must feel\nquite troubled about him.”\n\nHe looked askance at Mr. Mudge, enjoying that gentleman's growing\nirritation.\n\n“My son? No. Where----”\n\n“Nephews perhaps?” suggested the imperturbable John, leisurely\ncontinuing the manufacture of a whistle.\n\n“No, I tell you, nothing of the kind. But I can't sit waiting here.”\n\n“Oh, I hope you'll excuse me,” said John, apologetically. “I hope you\nwon't stop on my account. I didn't know you were in a hurry.”\n\n“Well, you know it now,” said Mr. Mudge, crossly. “When and where did\nyou see the boy you have described? I am in pursuit of him.”\n\n“Has he run away?” inquired John in assumed surprise.\n\n“Are you going to answer my question or not?” demanded Mr. Mudge,\nangrily.\n\n“Oh, I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have asked so many questions, only I\nthought he was a nice-looking boy, and I felt interested in him.”\n\n“He's a young scamp,” said Mr. Mudge, impetuously, “and it's my belief\nthat you're another. Now answer my question. When and where did you see\nthis boy?”\n\nThis time Mr. Mudge's menacing look warned John that he had gone far\nenough. Accordingly he answered promptly, “He passed by our farm this\nmorning.”\n\n“How far back is that?”\n\n“About three miles.”\n\n“Did he stop there?”\n\n“Yes, he stopped a while to rest.”\n\n“Have you seen him since?”\n\n“Yes, I saw him about half a mile back.”\n\n“On this road?”\n\n“Yes, but he turned up the road that branches off there.”\n\n“Just what I wanted to find out,” said Mr. Mudge, in a tone of\nsatisfaction, “I'm sure to catch him.”\n\nSo saying, he turned about and put his horse to its utmost speed,\ndetermined to make up for lost time. When he was fairly out of sight,\nPaul came forth from his hiding-place.\n\n“How could you do so!” he asked in a reproachful tone.\n\n“Could I do what?” asked John, turning a laughing face towards Paul.\n“Didn't I tell old Mudge the exact truth? You know you did turn up that\nroad. To be sure you didn't go two rods before turning back. But he\ndidn't stop to ask about that. If he hadn't been in such a hurry,\nperhaps I should have told him. Success to him!”\n\n“You can't think how I trembled when you described me so particularly.”\n\n“You didn't think I would betray you?” said John, quickly.\n\n“No, but I was afraid you would venture too far, and get us both into\ntrouble.”\n\n“Trust me for that, Paul; I've got my eyes wide open, and ain't easily\ncaught. But wasn't it fun to see old Mudge fuming while I kept him\nwaiting. What would he have said if he had known the bird was so near at\nhand? He looked foolish enough when I asked him if you were his son.”\n\nJohn sat down and gave vent to his pent-up laughter which he had felt\nobliged to restrain in the presence of Mr. Mudge. He laughed so heartily\nthat Paul, notwithstanding his recent fright and anxiety, could not\nresist the infection. Together they laughed, till the very air seemed\nvocal with merriment.\n\nJohn was the first to recover his gravity.\n\n“I am sorry, Paul,” he said, “but I must bid you good-by. They will miss\nme from the house. I am glad I have got acquainted with you, and I hope\nI shall see you again some time before very long. Good-by, Paul.”\n\n“Good-by, John.”\n\nThe two boys shook hands and parted. One went in one direction, the\nother in the opposite. Each looked back repeatedly till the other was\nout of sight. Then came over Paul once more a feeling of sadness and\ndesolation, which the high spirits of his companion had for the time\nkept off. Occasionally he cast a glance backwards, to make sure that\nMr. Mudge was not following him. But Paul had no cause to fear on that\nscore. The object of his dread was already some miles distant in a\ndifferent direction.\n\nFor an hour longer, Paul trudged on. He met few persons, the road not\nbeing very much frequented. He was now at least twelve miles from his\nstarting-place, and began to feel very sensibly the effects of heat\nand fatigue combined. He threw himself down upon the grass under the\noverhanging branches of an appletree to rest. After his long walk repose\nseemed delicious, and with a feeling of exquisite enjoyment he stretched\nhimself out at full length upon the soft turf, and closed his eyes.\n\nInsensibly he fell asleep. How long he slept he could not tell. He was\nfinally roused from his slumber by something cold touching his cheek.\nStarting up he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment, and gradually became\naware that this something was the nose of a Newfoundland dog, whose keen\nscent had enabled him to discover the whereabouts of the small stock\nof provisions with which Paul had been supplied by his late companion.\nFortunately he awoke in time to save its becoming the prey of its canine\nvisitor.\n\n“I reckon you came nigh losing your dinner,” fell upon his ears in a\nrough but hearty tone.\n\nAt the same time he heard the noise of wheels, and looking up, beheld a\nspecimen of a class well known throughout New England--a tin pedler. He\nwas seated on a cart liberally stocked with articles of tin ware. From\nthe rear depended two immense bags, one of which served as a receptacle\nfor white rags, the other for bits of calico and whatever else may fall\nunder the designation of “colored.” His shop, for such it was, was\ndrawn at a brisk pace by a stout horse, who in this respect presented a\ncontrast to his master, who was long and lank. The pedler himself was\na man of perhaps forty, with a face in which shrewdness and good humor\nseemed alike indicated. Take him for all in all, you might travel some\ndistance without falling in with a more complete specimen of the Yankee.\n\n“So you came nigh losing your dinner,” he repeated, in a pleasant tone.\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, “I got tired and fell asleep, and I don't know when I\nshould have waked up but for your dog.”\n\n“Yes, Boney's got a keen scent for provisions,” laughed the pedler.\n“He's a little graspin', like his namesake. You see his real name is\nBonaparte; we only call him Boney, for short.”\n\nMeanwhile he had stopped his horse. He was about to start afresh, when a\nthought struck him.\n\n“Maybe you're goin' my way,” said he, turning to Paul; “if you are,\nyou're welcome to a ride.”\n\nPaul was very glad to accept the invitation. He clambered into the cart,\nand took a seat behind the pedler, while Boney, who took his recent\ndisappointment very good-naturedly, jogged on contentedly behind.\n\n“How far are you goin'?” asked Paul's new acquaintance, as he whipped up\nhis horse.\n\nPaul felt a little embarrassed. If he had been acquainted with the names\nof any of the villages on the route he might easily have answered. As it\nwas, only one name occurred to him.\n\n“I think,” said he, with some hesitation, “that I shall go to New York.”\n\n“New York!” repeated the pedler, with a whistle expressive of his\nastonishment.\n\n“Well, you've a journey before you. Got any relations there?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“No uncles, aunts, cousins, nor nothing?”\n\nPaul shook his head.\n\n“Then what makes you go? Haven't run away from your father and mother,\nhey?” asked the pedler, with a knowing look.\n\n“I have no father nor mother,” said Paul, sadly enough.\n\n“Well, you had somebody to take care of you, I calculate. Where did you\nlive?”\n\n“If I tell you, you won't carry me back?” said Paul, anxiously.\n\n“Not a bit of it. I've got too much business on hand for that.”\n\nRelieved by this assurance, Paul told his story, encouraged thereto\nby frequent questions from his companion, who seemed to take a lively\ninterest in the adventures of his young companion.\n\n“That's a capital trick you played on old Mudge,” he said with a hearty\nlaugh which almost made the tins rattle. “I don't blame you a bit for\nrunning away. I've got a story to tell you about Mrs. Mudge. She's a\nregular skinflint.”\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nWAYSIDE GOSSIP.\n\n\nThis was the pedler's promised story about Mrs. Mudge.\n\n“The last time I was round that way, I stopped, thinking maybe they\nmight have some rags to dispose of for tin-ware. The old lady seemed\nglad to see me, and pretty soon she brought down a lot of white rags.\nI thought they seemed quite heavy for their bulk,--howsomever, I wasn't\nlooking for any tricks, and I let it go. By-and-by, when I happened to\nbe ransacking one of the bags, I came across half a dozen pounds or more\nof old iron tied up in a white cloth. That let the cat out of the bag. I\nknew why they were so heavy, then, I reckon I shan't call on Mrs. Mudge\nnext time I go by.”\n\n“So you've run off,” he continued, after a pause, “I like your\nspunk,--just what I should have done myself. But tell me how you managed\nto get off without the old chap's finding it out.”\n\nPaul related such of his adventures as he had not before told, his\ncompanion listening with marked approval.\n\n“I wish I'd been there,” he said. “I'd have given fifty cents, right\nout, to see how old Mudge looked, I calc'late he's pretty well tired\nwith his wild-goose chase by this time.”\n\nIt was now twelve o'clock, and both the travelers began to feel the\npangs of hunger.\n\n“It's about time to bait, I calc'late,” remarked the pedler.\n\nThe unsophisticated reader is informed that the word “bait,” in New\nEngland phraseology, is applied to taking lunch or dining.\n\nAt this point a green lane opened out of the public road, skirted on\neither side by a row of trees. Carpeted with green, it made a very\npleasant dining-room. A red-and-white heifer browsing at a little\ndistance looked up from her meal and surveyed the intruders with mild\nattention, but apparently satisfied that they contemplated no invasion\nof her rights, resumed her agreeable employment. Over an irregular stone\nwall our travelers looked into a thrifty apple-orchard laden with fruit.\nThey halted beneath a spreading chestnut-tree which towered above its\nneighbors, and offered them a grateful shelter from the noonday sun.\n\nFrom the box underneath the seat, the pedler took out a loaf of bread,\na slice of butter, and a tin pail full of doughnuts. Paul, on his side,\nbrought out his bread and gingerbread.\n\n“I most generally carry round my own provisions,” remarked the pedler,\nbetween two mouthfuls. “It's a good deal cheaper and more convenient,\ntoo. Help yourself to the doughnuts. I always calc'late to have some\nwith me. I'd give more for 'em any day than for rich cake that ain't\nfit for anybody. My mother used to beat everybody in the neighborhood on\nmaking doughnuts. She made 'em so good that we never knew when to stop\neating. You wouldn't hardly believe it, but, when I was a little shaver,\nI remember eating twenty-three doughnuts at one time. Pretty nigh killed\nme.”\n\n“I should think it might,” said Paul, laughing.\n\n“Mother got so scared that she vowed she wouldn't fry another for three\nmonths, but I guess she kinder lost the run of the almanac, for in less\nthan a week she turned out about a bushel more.”\n\nAll this time the pedler was engaged in practically refuting the saying,\nthat a man cannot do two things at once. With a little assistance from\nPaul, the stock of doughnuts on which he had been lavishing encomiums,\ndiminished rapidly. It was evident that his attachment to this homely\narticle of diet was quite as strong as ever.\n\n“Don't be afraid of them,” said he, seeing that Paul desisted from his\nefforts, “I've got plenty more in the box.”\n\nPaul signified that his appetite was already appeased.\n\n“Then we might as well be jogging on. Hey, Goliah,” said he, addressing\nthe horse, who with an air of great content, had been browsing while his\nmaster was engaged in a similar manner. “Queer name for a horse, isn't\nit? I wanted something out of the common way, so I asked mother for a\nname, and she gave me that. She's great on scripture names, mother\nis. She gave one to every one of her children. It didn't make much\ndifference to her what they were as long as they were in the Bible. I\nbelieve she used to open the Bible at random, and take the first name\nshe happened to come across. There are eight of us, and nary a decent\nname in the lot. My oldest brother's name is Abimelech. Then there's\nPharaoh, and Ishmael, and Jonadab, for the boys, and Leah and Naomi, for\nthe girls; but my name beats all. You couldn't guess it?”\n\nPaul shook his head.\n\n“I don't believe you could,” said the pedler, shaking his head in comic\nindignation. “It's Jehoshaphat. Ain't that a respectable name for the\nson of Christian parents?”\n\nPaul laughed.\n\n“It wouldn't be so bad,” continued the pedler, “if my other name was\nlonger; but Jehoshaphat seems rather a long handle to put before Stubbs.\nI can't say I feel particularly proud of the name, though for use it'll\ndo as well as any other. At any rate, it ain't quite so bad as the name\nmother pitched on for my youngest sister, who was lucky enough to die\nbefore she needed a name.”\n\n“What was it?” inquired Paul, really curious to know what name could be\nconsidered less desirable than Jehoshaphat.\n\n“It was Jezebel,” responded the pedler.\n\n“Everybody told mother 'twould never do; but she was kind of\nsuperstitious about it, because that was the first name she came to\nin the Bible, and so she thought it was the Lord's will that that name\nshould be given to the child.”\n\nAs Mr. Stubbs finished his disquisition upon names, there came in sight\na small house, dark and discolored with age and neglect. He pointed this\nout to Paul with his whip-handle.\n\n“That,” said he, “is where old Keziah Onthank lives. Ever heard of him?”\n\nPaul had not.\n\n“He's the oldest man in these parts,” pursued his loquacious companion.\n“There's some folks that seem a dyin' all the time, and for all that\nmanage to outlive half the young folks in the neighborhood. Old Keziah\nOnthank is a complete case in p'int. As long ago as when I was cutting\nmy teeth he was so old that nobody know'd how old he was. He was so\nbowed over that he couldn't see himself in the looking-glass unless you\nput it on the floor, and I guess even then what he saw wouldn't pay\nhim for his trouble. He was always ailin' some way or other. Now it was\nrheumatism, now the palsy, and then again the asthma. He had THAT awful.\n\n“He lived in the same tumble-down old shanty we have just passed,--so\npoor that nobody'd take the gift of it. People said that he'd orter go\nto the poorhouse, so that when he was sick--which was pretty much all\nthe time--he'd have somebody to take care of him. But he'd got kinder\nattached to the old place, seein' he was born there, and never lived\nanywhere else, and go he wouldn't.\n\n“Everybody expected he was near his end, and nobody'd have been\nsurprised to hear of his death at any minute. But it's strange how some\nfolks are determined to live on, as I said before. So Keziah, though he\nlooked so old when I was a boy that it didn't seem as if he could look\nany older, kept on livin,' and livin', and arter I got married to Betsy\nSprague, he was livin' still.\n\n“One day, I remember I was passin' by the old man's shanty, when I heard\na dreadful groanin', and thinks I to myself, 'I shouldn't wonder if the\nold man was on his last legs.' So in I bolted. There he was, to be sure,\na lyin', on the bed, all curled up into a heap, breathin' dreadful hard,\nand lookin' as white and pale as any ghost. I didn't know exactly\nwhat to do, so I went and got some water, but he motioned it away, and\nwouldn't drink it, but kept on groanin'.\n\n“'He mustn't be left here to die without any assistance,' thinks I, so I\nran off as fast I could to find the doctor.\n\n“I found him eatin' dinner----\n\n“Come quick,” says I, “to old Keziah Onthank's. He's dyin', as sure as\nmy name is Jehoshaphat.”\n\n“Well,” said the doctor, “die or no die, I can't come till I've eaten my\ndinner.”\n\n“But he's dyin', doctor.”\n\n“Oh, nonsense. Talk of old Keziah Onthank's dyin'. He'll live longer\nthan I shall.”\n\n“I recollect I thought the doctor very unfeelin' to talk so of a fellow\ncreetur, just stepping into eternity, as a body may say. However, it's\nno use drivin' a horse that's made up his mind he won't go, so although\nI did think the doctor dreadful deliberate about eatin' his dinner (he\nalways would take half an hour for it), I didn't dare to say a word\nfor fear he wouldn't come at all. You see the doctor was dreadful\nindependent, and was bent on havin' his own way, pretty much, though for\nthat matter I think it's the case with most folks. However, to come back\nto my story, I didn't feel particularly comfortable while I was waitin'\nhis motions.\n\n“After a long while the doctor got ready. I was in such a hurry that I\nactilly pulled him along, he walked so slow; but he only laughed, and\nI couldn't help thinkin' that doctorin' had a hardinin' effect on the\nheart. I was determined if ever I fell sick I wouldn't send for him.\n\n“At last we got there. I went in all of a tremble, and crept to the bed,\nthinkin' I should see his dead body. But he wasn't there at all. I felt\na little bothered you'd better believe.”\n\n“Well,” said the doctor, turning to me with a smile, “what do you think\nnow?”\n\n“I don't know what to think,” said I.\n\n“Then I'll help you,” said he.\n\n“So sayin', he took me to the winder, and what do you think I see? As\nsure as I'm alive, there was the old man in the back yard, a squattin'\ndown and pickin' up chips.”\n\n“And is he still living?”\n\n“Yes, or he was when I come along last. The doctor's been dead these\nten years. He told me old Keziah would outlive him, but I didn't believe\nhim. I shouldn't be surprised if he lived forever.”\n\nPaul listened with amused interest to this and other stories with which\nhis companion beguiled the way. They served to divert his mind from\nthe realities of his condition, and the uncertainty which hung over his\nworldly prospects.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nON THE BRINK OF DISCOVERY.\n\n\n“If you're in no great hurry to go to New York,” said the pedler, “I\nshould like to have you stay with me for a day or two. I live about\ntwenty-five miles from here, straight ahead, so it will be on your way.\nI always manage to get home by Saturday night if it is any way possible.\nIt doesn't seem comfortable to be away Sunday. As to-day is Friday, I\nshall get there to-morrow. So you can lie over a day and rest yourself.”\n\nPaul felt grateful for this unexpected invitation. It lifted quite a\nload from his mind, since, as the day declined, certain anxious thoughts\nas to where he should find shelter, had obtruded themselves. Even now,\nthe same trouble would be experienced on Monday night, but it is the\ncharacteristic of youth to pay little regard to anticipated difficulties\nas long as the present is provided for.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the pedler neglected his business on\naccount of his companion. On the road he had been traveling the houses\nwere few and far between. He had, therefore, but few calls to make.\nPaul remarked, however, that when he did call he seldom failed to sell\nsomething.\n\n“Yes,” said Mr. Stubbs, on being interrogated, “I make it a p'int to\nsell something, if it's no more than a tin dipper. I find some hard\ncases sometimes, and sometimes I have to give it up altogether. I can't\nquite come up to a friend of mine, Daniel Watson, who used to be in\nthe same line of business. I never knew him to stop at a place without\nselling something. He had a good deal of judgment, Daniel had, and knew\njust when to use 'soft sodder,' and when not to. On the road that he\ntraveled there lived a widow woman, who had the reputation of being as\nugly, cross-grained a critter as ever lived. People used to say that\nit was enough to turn milk sour for her even to look at it. Well, it so\nhappened that Daniel had never called there. One night he was boasting\nthat he never called at a house without driving a bargain, when one\nof the company asked him, with a laugh, if he had ever sold the widow\nanything.\n\n“Why, no,” said Daniel, “I never called there; but I've no doubt I\ncould.”\n\n“What'll you bet of it?”\n\n“I'm not a betting man,” said Daniel, “but I feel so sure of it that I\ndon't mind risking five dollars.”\n\n“Agreed.”\n\n“The next morning Daniel drove leisurely up to the widow's door and\nknocked. She had a great aversion to pedlers, and declared they were\ncheats, every one of them. She was busy sweeping when Daniel knocked.\nShe came to the door in a dreadful hurry, hoping it might be an old\nwidower in the neighborhood that she was trying to catch. When she saw\nhow much she was mistaken she looked as black as a thundercloud.\n\n“Want any tin ware to-day, ma'am?” inquired Daniel, noways discomposed.\n\n“No, sir,” snapped she.\n\n“Got all kinds,--warranted the best in the market. Couldn't I sell you\nsomething?”\n\n“Not a single thing,” said she, preparing to shut the door; but Daniel,\nknowing all would then be lost, stepped in before she could shut it\nquite to, and began to name over some of the articles he had in his\nwagon.\n\n“You may talk till doomsday,” said the widow, as mad as could be, “and\nit won't do a particle of good. Now, you've got your answer, and you'd\nbetter leave the house before you are driven out.”\n\n“Brooms, brushes, lamps----”\n\n“Here the widow, who had been trying to keep in her anger, couldn't hold\nout any longer. She seized the broom she had been sweeping with, and\nbrought it down with a tremendous whack upon Daniel's back. You can\nimagine how hard it was, when I tell you that the force of the blow\nsnapped the broom in the middle. You might have thought Daniel would\nresent it, but he didn't appear to notice it, though it must have hurt\nhim awful. He picked up the pieces, and handing them, with a polite bow,\nto the widow, said, 'Now, ma'am, I'm sure you need a new broom. I've got\nsome capital ones out in the cart.'”\n\n“The widow seemed kind of overpowered by his coolness. She hardly knew\nwhat to say or what to think. However, she had broken her old broom,\nthat was certain, and must have a new one; so when Daniel ran out and\nbrought in a bundle of them, she picked out one and paid for it without\nsaying a word; only, when Daniel asked if he might have the pleasure\nof calling again, she looked a little queer, and told him that if he\nconsidered it a pleasure, she had no objection.”\n\n“And did he call again?”\n\n“Yes, whenever he went that way. The widow was always very polite to him\nafter that, and, though she had a mortal dislike to pedlers in general,\nshe was always ready to trade with him. Daniel used to say that he\ngained his bet and the widow's custom at ONE BLOW.”\n\nThey were now descending a little hill at the foot of which stood a\ncountry tavern. Here Mr. Stubbs declared his intention of spending the\nnight. He drove into the barn, the large door of which stood invitingly\nopen, and unharnessed his horse, taking especial care to rub him down\nand set before him an ample supply of provender.\n\n“I always take care of Goliah myself,” said he. “He's a good friend to\nme, and it's no more than right that I should take good care of him.\nNow, we'll go into the house, and see what we can get for supper.”\n\nHe was surprised to see that Paul hung back, and seemed disinclined to\nfollow.\n\n“What's the matter?” asked Mr. Stubbs, in surprise. “Why don't you\ncome?”\n\n“Because,” said Paul, looking embarrassed, “I've got no money.”\n\n“Well, I have,” said Mr. Stubbs, “and that will answer just as well, so\ncome along, and don't be bashful. I'm about as hungry as a bear, and I\nguess you are too.”\n\nBefore many minutes, Paul sat down to a more bountiful repast than\nhe had partaken of for many a day. There were warm biscuits and fresh\nbutter, such as might please the palate of an epicure, while at the\nother end of the table was a plate of cake, flanked on one side by an\napple-pie, on the other by one of pumpkin, with its rich golden hue,\nsuch as is to be found in its perfection, only in New England. It will\nscarcely be doubted that our hungry travellers did full justice to the\nfare set before them.\n\nWhen they had finished, they went into the public room, where were\nengaged some of the village worthies, intent on discussing the news\nand the political questions of the day. It was a time of considerable\npolitical excitement, and this naturally supplied the topic of\nconversation. In this the pedler joined, for his frequent travel on this\nroute had made him familiarly acquainted with many of those present.\n\nPaul sat in a corner, trying to feel interested in the conversation; but\nthe day had been a long one, and he had undergone an unusual amount of\nfatigue. Gradually, his drowsiness increased. The many voices fell upon\nhis ears like a lullaby, and in a few minutes he was fast asleep.\n\nEarly next morning they were up and on their way. It was the second\nmorning since Paul's departure. Already a sense of freedom gave his\nspirits unwonted elasticity, and encouraged him to hope for the best.\nHad his knowledge of the future been greater, his confidence might have\nbeen less. But would he have been any happier?\n\nSo many miles separated him from his late home, that he supposed himself\nquite safe from detection. A slight circumstance warned him that he must\nstill be watchful and cautious.\n\nAs they were jogging easily along, they heard the noise of wheels at a\nlittle distance. Paul looked up. To his great alarms he recognized\nin the driver of the approaching vehicle, one of the selectmen of\nWrenville.\n\n“What's the matter?” asked his companion, noticing his sudden look of\napprehension.\n\nPaul quickly communicated the ground of his alarm.\n\n“And you are afraid he will want to carry you back, are you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Not a bit of it. We'll circumvent the old fellow, unless he's sharper\nthan I think he is. You've only got to do as I tell you.”\n\nTo this Paul quickly agreed.\n\nThe selectman was already within a hundred rods. He had not yet\napparently noticed the pedler's cart, so that this was in our hero's\nfavor. Mr. Stubbs had already arranged his plan of operations.\n\n“This is what you are to do, Paul,” said he, quickly. “Cock your hat on\nthe side of your head, considerably forward, so that he can't see much\nof your face. Then here's a cigar to stick in your mouth. You can make\nbelieve that you are smoking. If you are the sort of boy I reckon you\nare, he'll never think it's you.”\n\nPaul instantly adopted this suggestion.\n\nSlipping his hat to one side in the jaunty manner characteristic of\nyoung America, he began to puff very gravely at a cigar the pedler\nhanded him, frequently taking it from his mouth, as he had seen older\npersons do, to knock away the ashes. Nothwithstanding his alarm, his\nlove of fun made him enjoy this little stratagem, in which he bore his\npart successfully.\n\nThe selectman eyed him intently. Paul began to tremble from fear of\ndiscovery, but his apprehensions were speedily dissipated by a remark of\nthe new-comer, “My boy, you are forming a very bad habit.”\n\nPaul did not dare to answer lest his voice should betray him. To his\nrelief, the pedler spoke----\n\n“Just what I tell him, sir, but I suppose he thinks he must do as his\nfather does.”\n\nBy this time the vehicles had passed each other, and the immediate peril\nwas over.\n\n“Now, Paul,” said his companion, laughing, “I'll trouble you for that\ncigar, if you have done with it. The old gentleman's advice was good. If\nI'd never learned to smoke, I wouldn't begin now.”\n\nOur hero was glad to take the cigar from his mouth. The brief time he\nhad held it was sufficient to make him slightly dizzy.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nPAUL REACHES THE CITY.\n\n\nTowards evening they drew up before a small house with a neat yard in\nfront.\n\n“I guess we'll get out here,” said Mr. Stubbs. “There's a gentleman\nlives here that I feel pretty well acquainted with. Shouldn't wonder if\nhe'd let us stop over Sunday. Whoa, Goliah, glad to get home, hey?” as\nthe horse pricked up his ears and showed manifest signs of satisfaction.\n\n“Now, youngster, follow me, and I guess I can promise you some supper,\nif Mrs. Stubbs hasn't forgotten her old tricks.”\n\nThey passed through the entry into the kitchen, where Mrs. Stubbs was\ndiscovered before the fire toasting slices of bread.\n\n“Lor, Jehoshaphat,” said she, “I didn't expect you so soon,” and she\nlooked inquiringly at his companion.\n\n“A young friend who is going to stay with us till Monday,” explained the\npedler. “His name is Paul Prescott.”\n\n“I'm glad to see you, Paul,” said Mrs. Stubbs with a friendly smile.\n“You must be tired if you've been traveling far. Take a seat. Here's a\nrocking-chair for you.”\n\nThis friendly greeting made Paul feel quite at home. Having no children,\nthe pedler and his wife exerted themselves to make the time pass\npleasantly to their young acquaintance. Paul could not help contrasting\nthem with Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, not very much to the advantage of\nthe latter. On Sunday he went to church with them, and the peculiar\ncircumstances in which he was placed, made him listen to the sermon with\nunusual attention. It was an exposition of the text, “My help cometh\nfrom the Lord,” and Paul could not help feeling that it was particularly\napplicable to his own case. It encouraged him to hope, that, however\nuncertain his prospects appeared, God would help him if he put his trust\nin Him.\n\nOn Monday morning Paul resumed his journey, with an ample stock of\nprovisions supplied by Mrs. Stubbs, in the list of which doughnuts\noccupied a prominent place; this being at the particular suggestion of\nMr. Stubbs.\n\nForty or fifty miles remained to be traversed before his destination\nwould be reached. The road was not a difficult one to find, and he made\nit out without much questioning. The first night, he sought permission\nto sleep in a barn.\n\nHe met with a decided refusal.\n\nHe was about to turn away in disappointment, when he was called back.\n\n“You are a little too fast, youngster. I said I wouldn't let you sleep\nin my barn, and I won't; but I've got a spare bed in the house, and if\nyou choose you shall occupy it.”\n\nUnder the guise of roughness, this man had a kind heart. He inquired\ninto the particulars of Paul's story, and at the conclusion terrified\nhim by saying that he had been very foolish and ought to be sent back.\nNevertheless, when Paul took leave of him the next morning, he did not\ngo away empty-handed.\n\n“If you must be so foolish as to set up for yourself, take this,” said\nthe farmer, placing half a dollar in his hand. “You may reach the city\nafter the banks are closed for the day, you know,” he added, jocularly.\n\nBut it was in the morning that Paul came in sight of the city. He\nclimbed up into a high tree, which, having the benefit of an elevated\nsituation, afforded him an extensive prospect. Before him lay the great\ncity of which he had so often heard, teeming with life and activity.\n\nHalf in eager anticipation, half in awe and wonder at its vastness, our\nyoung pilgrim stood upon the threshold of this great Babel.\n\nEverything looked new and strange. It had never entered Paul's mind,\nthat there could be so many houses in the whole State as now rose up\nbefore him. He got into Broadway, and walked on and on thinking that\nthe street must end somewhere. But the farther he walked the thicker the\nhouses seemed crowded together. Every few rods, too, he came to a cross\nstreet, which seemed quite as densely peopled as the one on which he was\nwalking. One part of the city was the same as another to Paul, since\nhe was equally a stranger to all. He wandered listlessly along, whither\nfancy led. His mind was constantly excited by the new and strange\nobjects which met him at every step.\n\nAs he was looking in at a shop window, a boy of about his own age,\nstopped and inquired confidentially, “when did you come from the\ncountry?”\n\n“This morning,” said Paul, wondering how a stranger should know that he\nwas a country boy.\n\n“Could you tell me what is the price of potatoes up your way?” asked the\nother boy, with perfect gravity.\n\n“I don't know,” said Paul, innocently.\n\n“I'm sorry for that,” said the other, “as I have got to buy some for my\nwife and family.”\n\nPaul stared in surprise for a moment, and then realizing that he was\nbeing made game of, began to grow angry.\n\n“You'd better go home to your wife and family,” he said with spirit, “or\nyou may get hurt.”\n\n“Bully for you, country!” answered the other with a laugh. “You're not\nas green as you look.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Paul, “I wish I could say as much for you.”\n\nTired with walking, Paul at length sat down in a doorway, and watched\nwith interest the hurrying crowds that passed before him. Everybody\nseemed to be in a hurry, pressing forward as if life and death depended\non his haste. There were lawyers with their sharp, keen glances;\nmerchants with calculating faces; speculators pondering on the chances\nof a rise or fall in stocks; errand boys with bundles under their arms;\nbusiness men hurrying to the slip to take the boat for Brooklyn or\nJersey City,--all seemed intent on business of some kind, even to the\nragged newsboys who had just obtained their supply of evening papers,\nand were now crying them at the top of their voices,--and very\ndiscordant ones at that, so Paul thought. Of the hundreds passing and\nrepassing before him, every one had something to do. Every one had a\nhome to go to. Perhaps it was not altogether strange that a feeling of\ndesolation should come over Paul as he recollected that he stood alone,\nhomeless, friendless, and, it might be, shelterless for the coming\nnight.\n\n“Yet,” thought he with something of hopefulness, “there must be\nsomething for me to do as well as the rest.”\n\nJust then a boy some two years older than Paul paced slowly by, and\nin passing, chanced to fix his eyes upon our hero. He probably saw\nsomething in Paul which attracted him, for he stepped up and extending\nhis hand, said, “why, Tom, how came you here?”\n\n“My name isn't Tom,” said Paul, feeling a little puzzled by this\naddress.\n\n“Why, so it isn't. But you look just like my friend, Tom Crocker.”\n\nTo this succeeded a few inquiries, which Paul unsuspiciously answered.\n\n“Do you like oysters?” inquired the new-comer, after a while.\n\n“Very much.”\n\n“Because I know of a tip top place to get some, just round the corner.\nWouldn't you like some?”\n\nPaul thanked his new acquaintance, and said he would.\n\nWithout more ado, his companion ushered him into a basement room near\nby. He led the way into a curtained recess, and both boys took seats one\non each side of a small table.\n\n“Just pull the bell, will you, and tell the waiter we'll have two\nstews.”\n\nPaul did so.\n\n“I suppose,” continued the other, “the governor wouldn't like it much if\nhe knew where I was.”\n\n“The governor!” repeated Paul. “Why, it isn't against the laws, is it?”\n\n“No,” laughed the other. “I mean my father. How jolly queer you are!” He\nmeant to say green, but had a purpose in not offending Paul.\n\n“Are you the Governor's son?” asked Paul in amazement.\n\n“To be sure,” carelessly replied the other.\n\nPaul's wonder had been excited many times in the course of the day, but\nthis was more surprising than anything which had yet befallen him. That\nhe should have the luck to fall in with the son of the Governor, on his\nfirst arrival in the city, and that the latter should prove so affable\nand condescending, was indeed surprising. Paul inwardly determined\nto mention it in his first letter to Aunt Lucy. He could imagine her\nastonishment.\n\nWhile he was busy with these thoughts, his companion had finished his\noysters.\n\n“Most through?” he inquired nonchalantly.\n\n“I've got to step out a minute; wait till I come back.”\n\nPaul unsuspectingly assented.\n\nHe heard his companion say a word to the barkeeper, and then go out.\n\nHe waited patiently for fifteen minutes and he did not return; another\nquarter of an hour, and he was still absent. Thinking he might have\nbeen unexpectedly detained, he rose to go, but was called back by the\nbarkeeper.\n\n“Hallo, youngster! are you going off without paying?”\n\n“For what?” inquired Paul, in surprise.\n\n“For the oysters, of course. You don't suppose I give 'em away, do you?”\n\n“I thought,” hesitated Paul, “that the one who was with me paid,--the\nGovernor's son,” he added, conscious of a certain pride in his intimacy\nwith one so nearly related to the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth.\n\n“The Governor's son,” laughed the barkeeper. “Why the Governor lives a\nhundred miles off and more. That wasn't the Governor's son any more than\nI am.”\n\n“He called his father governor,” said Paul, beginning to be afraid that\nhe had made some ridiculous blunder.\n\n“Well, I wouldn't advise you to trust him again, even if he's the\nPresident's son. He only got you in here to pay for his oysters. He told\nme when he went out that you would pay for them.”\n\n“And didn't he say he was coming back?” asked Paul, quite dumbfounded.\n\n“He said you hadn't quite finished, but would pay for both when you came\nout. It's two shillings.”\n\nPaul rather ruefully took out the half dollar which constituted his\nentire stock of money, and tendered it to the barkeeper who returned him\nthe change.\n\nSo Paul went out into the streets, with his confidence in human nature\nsomewhat lessened.\n\nHere, then, is our hero with twenty-five cents in his pocket, and his\nfortune to make.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nA STRANGE BED-CHAMBER.\n\n\nAlthough Paul could not help being vexed at having been so cleverly\ntaken in by his late companion, he felt the better for having eaten the\noysters. Carefully depositing his only remaining coin in his pocket, he\nresumed his wanderings. It is said that a hearty meal is a good promoter\nof cheerfulness. It was so in Paul's case, and although he had as yet\nhad no idea where he should find shelter for the night he did not allow\nthat consideration to trouble him.\n\nSo the day passed, and the evening came on. Paul's appetite returned to\nhim once more. He invested one-half of his money at an old woman's stall\nfor cakes and apples, and then he ate leisurely while leaning against\nthe iron railing which encircles the park.\n\nHe began to watch with interest the movements of those about him.\nAlready the lamplighter had started on his accustomed round, and with\nladder in hand was making his way from one lamp-post to another. Paul\nquite marvelled at the celerity with which the lamps were lighted, never\nbefore having witnessed the use of gas. He was so much interested in the\nprocess that he sauntered along behind the lamplighter for some time. At\nlength his eye fell upon a group common enough in our cities, but new to\nhim.\n\nAn Italian, short and dark-featured, with a velvet cap, was grinding out\nmusic from a hand-organ, while a woman with a complexion equally\ndark, and black sorrowful-looking eyes, accompanied her husband on the\ntambourine. They were playing a lively tune as Paul came up, but quickly\nglided into “Home, Sweet Home.”\n\nPaul listened with pleased, yet sad interest, for him “home” was only a\nsad remembrance.\n\nHe wandered on, pausing now and then to look into one of the brilliantly\nilluminated shop windows, or catching a glimpse through the open doors\nof the gay scene within, and as one after another of these lively scenes\npassed before him, he began to think that all the strange and wonderful\nthings in the world must be collected in these rich stores.\n\nNext, he came to a place of public amusement. Crowds were entering\nconstantly, and Paul, from curiosity, entered too. He passed on to a\nlittle wicket, when a man stopped him.\n\n“Where's your ticket?” he asked.\n\n“I haven't got any,” said Paul.\n\n“Then what business have you here?” said the man, roughly.\n\n“Isn't this a meeting-house?” asked Paul.\n\nThis remark seemed to amuse two boys who were standing by. Looking up\nwith some indignation, Paul recognized in one of them the boy who had\ncheated him out of the oysters.\n\n“Look here,” said Paul, “what made you go off and leave me to pay for\nthe oysters this morning?”\n\n“Which of us do you mean?” inquired the 'governor's son,' carelessly.\n\n“I mean you.”\n\n“Really, I don't understand your meaning. Perhaps you mistake me for\nsomebody else.”\n\n“What?” said Paul, in great astonishment. “Don't you remember me, and\nhow you told me you were the Governor's son?”\n\nBoth boys laughed.\n\n“You must be mistaken. I haven't the honor of being related to the\ndistinguished gentleman you name.”\n\nThe speaker made a mocking bow to Paul.\n\n“I know that,” said Paul, with spirit, “but you said you were, for all\nthat.”\n\n“It must have been some other good-looking boy, that you are mistaking\nme for. What are you going to do about it? I hope, by the way, that the\noysters agreed with you.”\n\n“Yes, they did,” said Paul, “for I came honestly by them.”\n\n“He's got you there, Gerald,” said the other boy.\n\nPaul made his way out of the theater. As his funds were reduced to\ntwelve cents, he could not have purchased a ticket if he had desired it.\n\nStill he moved on.\n\nSoon he came to another building, which was in like manner lighted up,\nbut not so brilliantly as the theater. This time, from the appearance\nof the building, and from the tall steeple,--so tall that his eye could\nscarcely reach the tapering spire,--he knew that it must be a church.\nThere was not such a crowd gathered about the door as at the place he\nhad just left, but he saw a few persons entering, and he joined them.\nThe interior of the church was far more gorgeous than the plain village\nmeeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend with his mother. He\ngazed about him with a feeling of awe, and sank quietly into a back\npew. As it was a week-day evening, and nothing of unusual interest was\nanticipated, there were but few present, here and there one, scattered\nthrough the capacious edifice.\n\nBy-and-by the organist commenced playing, and a flood of music, grander\nand more solemn than he had ever heard, filled the whole edifice. He\nlistened with rapt attention and suspended breath till the last note\ndied away, and then sank back upon the richly cushioned seat with a\nfeeling of enjoyment.\n\nIn the services which followed he was not so much interested. The\nofficiating clergyman delivered a long homily in a dull unimpassioned\nmanner, which failed to awaken his interest. Already disposed to be\ndrowsy, it acted upon him like a gentle soporific. He tried to pay\nattention as he had always been used to do, but owing to his occupying a\nback seat, and the low voice of the preacher, but few words reached him,\nand those for the most part were above his comprehension.\n\nGradually the feeling of fatigue--for he had been walking the streets\nall day--became so powerful that his struggles to keep awake became\nharder and harder. In vain he sat erect, resolved not to yield. The\nmoment afterwards his head inclined to one side; the lights began to\nswim before his eyes; the voice of the preacher subsided into a low and\nundistinguishable hum. Paul's head sank upon the cushion, his bundle,\nwhich had been his constant companion during the day, fell softly to the\nfloor, and he fell into a deep sleep.\n\nMeanwhile the sermon came to a close, and another hymn was sung, but\neven the music was insufficient to wake our hero now. So the benediction\nwas pronounced, and the people opened the doors of their pews and left\nthe church.\n\nLast of all the sexton walked up and down the aisles, closing such of\nthe pew doors as were open. Then he shut off the gas, and after\nlooking around to see that nothing was forgotten, went out, apparently\nsatisfied, and locked the outer door behind him.\n\nPaul, meanwhile, wholly unconscious of his situation, slept on as\ntranquilly as if there were nothing unusual in the circumstances in\nwhich he was placed. Through the stained windows the softened light fell\nupon his tranquil countenance, on which a smile played, as if his dreams\nwere pleasant. What would Aunt Lucy have thought if she could have seen\nher young friend at this moment?\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\nA TURN OF FORTUNE.\n\nNotwithstanding his singular bedchamber, Paul had a refreshing night's\nsleep from which he did not awake till the sun had fairly risen, and its\nrays colored by the medium through which they were reflected, streamed\nin at the windows and rested in many fantastic lines on the richly\ncarved pulpit and luxurious pews.\n\nPaul sprang to his feet and looked around him in bewilderment.\n\n“Where am I?” he exclaimed in astonishment.\n\nIn the momentary confusion of ideas which is apt to follow a sudden\nawakening, he could not remember where he was, or how he chanced to\nbe there. But in a moment memory came to his aid, and he recalled the\nevents of the preceding day, and saw that he must have been locked up in\nthe church.\n\n“How am I going to get out?” Paul asked himself in dismay.\n\nThis was the important question just now. He remembered that the village\nmeeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend was rarely opened\nexcept on Sundays. What if this should be the case here? It was Thursday\nmorning, and three days must elapse before his release. This would never\ndo. He must seek some earlier mode of deliverance.\n\nHe went first to the windows, but found them so secured that it was\nimpossible for him to get them open. He tried the doors, but found, as\nhe had anticipated, that they were fast. His last resource failing, he\nwas at liberty to follow the dictates of his curiosity.\n\nFinding a small door partly open, he peeped within, and found a flight\nof steep stairs rising before him. They wound round and round, and\nseemed almost interminable. At length, after he had become almost weary\nof ascending, he came to a small window, out of which he looked. At his\nfeet lay the numberless roofs of the city, while not far away his eye\nrested on thousands of masts. The river sparkled in the sun, and Paul,\nin spite of his concern, could not help enjoying the scene. The sound\nof horses and carriages moving along the great thoroughfare below came\nconfusedly to his ears. He leaned forward to look down, but the distance\nwas so much greater than he had thought, that he drew back in alarm.\n\n“What shall I do?” Paul asked himself, rather frightened. “I wonder if I\ncan stand going without food for three days? I suppose nobody would hear\nme if I should scream as loud as I could.”\n\nPaul shouted, but there was so much noise in the streets that nobody\nprobably heard him.\n\nHe descended the staircase, and once more found himself in the body\nof the church. He went up into the pulpit, but there seemed no hope of\nescape in that direction. There was a door leading out on one side, but\nthis only led to a little room into which the minister retired before\nservice.\n\nIt seemed rather odd to Paul to find himself the sole occupant of so\nlarge a building. He began to wonder whether it would not have been\nbetter for him to stay in the poorhouse, than come to New York to die of\nstarvation.\n\nJust at this moment Paul heard a key rattle in the outer door. Filled\nwith new hope, he ran down the pulpit stairs and out into the porch,\njust in time to see the entrance of the sexton.\n\nThe sexton started in surprise as his eye fell upon Paul standing before\nhim, with his bundle under his arm.\n\n“Where did you come from, and how came you here?” he asked with some\nsuspicion.\n\n“I came in last night, and fell asleep.”\n\n“So you passed the night here?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“What made you come in at all?” inquired the sexton, who knew enough of\nboys to be curious upon this point.\n\n“I didn't know where else to go,” said Paul.\n\n“Where do you live?”\n\nPaul answered with perfect truth, “I don't live anywhere.”\n\n“What! Have you no home?” asked the sexton in surprise.\n\nPaul shook his head.\n\n“Where should you have slept if you hadn't come in here?”\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure.”\n\n“And I suppose you don't know where you shall sleep to-night?”\n\nPaul signified that he did not.\n\n“I knew there were plenty of such cases,” said the sexton, meditatively;\n“but I never seemed to realize it before.”\n\n“How long have you been in New York?” was his next inquiry.\n\n“Not very long,” said Paul. “I only got here yesterday.”\n\n“Then you don't know anybody in the city?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why did you come here, then?”\n\n“Because I wanted to go somewhere where I could earn a living, and I\nthought I might find something to do here.”\n\n“But suppose you shouldn't find anything to do?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Paul, slowly. “I haven't thought much about that.”\n\n“Well, my lad,” said the sexton, not unkindly, “I can't say your\nprospects look very bright. You should have good reasons for entering on\nsuch an undertaking. I--I don't think you are a bad boy. You don't look\nlike a bad one,” he added, half to himself.\n\n“I hope not, sir,” said Paul.\n\n“I hope not, too. I was going to say that I wish I could help you to\nsome kind of work. If you will come home with me, you shall be welcome\nto a dinner, and perhaps I may be able to think of something for you.”\n\nPaul gladly prepared to follow his new acquaintance.\n\n“What is your name?” inquired the sexton.\n\n“Paul Prescott.”\n\n“That sounds like a good name. I suppose you haven't got much money?”\n\n“Only twelve cents.”\n\n“Bless me! only twelve cents. Poor boy! you are indeed poor.”\n\n“But I can work,” said Paul, spiritedly. “I ought to be able to earn my\nliving.”\n\n“Yes, yes, that's the way to feel. Heaven helps those who help\nthemselves.”\n\nWhen they were fairly out of the church, Paul had an opportunity of\nobserving his companion's external appearance. He was an elderly man,\nwith harsh features, which would have been forbidding, but for a certain\nair of benevolence which softened their expression.\n\nAs Paul walked along, he related, with less of detail, the story which\nis already known to the reader. The sexton said little except in the\nway of questions designed to elicit further particulars, till, at the\nconclusion he said, “Must tell Hester.”\n\nAt length they came to a small house, in a respectable but not\nfashionable quarter of the city. One-half of this was occupied by the\nsexton. He opened the door and led the way into the sitting-room. It\nwas plainly but neatly furnished, the only ornament being one or two\nengravings cheaply framed and hung over the mantel-piece. They were\nby no means gems of art, but then, the sexton did not claim to be a\nconnoisseur, and would probably not have understood the meaning of the\nword.\n\n“Sit here a moment,” said the sexton, pointing to a chair, “I'll go and\nspeak to Hester.”\n\nPaul whiled away the time in looking at the pictures in a copy of “The\nPilgrim's Progress,” which lay on the table.\n\nIn the next room sat a woman of perhaps fifty engaged in knitting. It\nwas very easy to see that she could never have possessed the perishable\ngift of beauty. Hers was one of the faces on which nature has written\nPLAIN, in unmistakable characters. Yet if the outward features had been\na reflex of the soul within, few faces would have been more attractive\nthan that of Hester Cameron. At the feet of the sexton's wife, for such\nshe was, reposed a maltese cat, purring softly by way of showing her\ncontentment. Indeed, she had good reason to be satisfied. In default of\nchildren, puss had become a privileged pet, being well fed and carefully\nshielded from all the perils that beset cat-hood.\n\n“Home so soon?” said Hester inquiringly, as her husband opened the door.\n\n“Yes, Hester, and I have brought company with me,” said the sexton.\n\n“Company!” repeated his wife. “Who is it?”\n\n“It is a poor boy, who was accidentally locked up in the church last\nnight.”\n\n“And he had to stay there all night?”\n\n“Yes; but perhaps it was lucky for him, for he had no other place to\nsleep, and not money enough to pay for one.”\n\n“Poor child!” said Hester, compassionately. “Is it not terrible to think\nthat any human creature should be without the comforts of a home which\neven our tabby possesses. It ought to make you thankful that you are so\nwell cared for, Tab.”\n\nThe cat opened her eyes and winked drowsily at her mistress.\n\n“So you brought the poor boy home, Hugh?”\n\n“Yes, Hester,--I thought we ought not to begrudge a meal to one less\nfavored by fortune than ourselves. You know we should consider ourselves\nthe almoners of God's bounties.”\n\n“Surely, Hugh.”\n\n“I knew you would feel so, Hester. And suppose we have the chicken for\ndinner that I sent in the morning. I begin to have a famous appetite. I\nthink I should enjoy it.”\n\nHester knew perfectly well that it was for Paul's sake, and not for his\nown, that her husband spoke. But she so far entered into his feelings,\nthat she determined to expend her utmost skill as cook upon the dinner,\nthat Paul might have at least one good meal.\n\n“Now I will bring the boy in,” said he. “I am obliged to go to work, but\nyou will find some way to entertain him, I dare say.”\n\n“If you will come out (this he said to Paul), I will introduce you to a\nnew friend.”\n\nPaul was kindly welcomed by the sexton's wife, who questioned him in\na sympathizing tone about his enforced stay in the church. To all her\nquestions Paul answered in a modest yet manly fashion, so as to produce\na decidedly favorable impression upon his entertainer.\n\nOur hero was a handsome boy. Just at present he was somewhat thin, not\nhaving entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness and poor fare\nwhile a member of Mr. Mudge's family; but he was well made, and bade\nfair to become a stout boy. His manner was free and unembarrassed, and\nhe carried a letter of recommendation in his face. It must be admitted,\nhowever that there were two points in which his appearance might have\nbeen improved. Both his hands and face had suffered from the dust of\ntravel. His clothes, too, were full of dust.\n\nA single glance told Hester all this, and she resolved to remedy it.\n\nShe quietly got some water and a towel, and requested Paul to pull off\nhis jacket, which she dusted while he was performing his ablutions.\nThen, with the help of a comb to arrange his disordered hair, he seemed\nquite like a new boy, and felt quite refreshed by the operation.\n\n“Really, it improves him very much,” said Hester to herself.\n\nShe couldn't help recalling a boy of her own,--the only child she ever\nhad,--who had been accidentally drowned when about the age of Paul.\n\n“If he had only lived,” she thought, “how different might have been our\nlives.”\n\nA thought came into her mind, and she looked earnestly at Paul.\n\n“I--yes I will speak to Hugh about it,” she said, speaking aloud,\nunconsciously.\n\n“Did you speak to me?” asked Paul.\n\n“No,--I was thinking of something.”\n\nShe observed that Paul was looking rather wistfully at a loaf of bread\non the table.\n\n“Don't you feel hungry?” she asked, kindly.\n\n“I dare say you have had no breakfast.”\n\n“I have eaten nothing since yesterday afternoon.”\n\n“Bless my soul! How hungry you must be!” said the good woman, as she\nbustled about to get a plate of butter and a knife.\n\nShe must have been convinced of it by the rapid manner in which the\nslices of bread and butter disappeared.\n\nAt one o'clock the sexton came home. Dinner was laid, and Paul partook\nof it with an appetite little affected by his lunch of the morning. As\nhe rose from the table, he took his cap, and saying, “Good-by, I thank\nyou very much for your kindness!” he was about to depart.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked the sexton, in surprise.\n\n“I don't know,” answered Paul.\n\n“Stop a minute. Hester, I want to speak to you.”\n\nThey went into the sitting-room together.\n\n“This boy, Hester,” he commenced with hesitation.\n\n“Well, Hugh?”\n\n“He has no home.”\n\n“It is a hard lot.”\n\n“Do you think we should be the worse off if we offered to share our home\nwith him?”\n\n“It is like your kind heart, Hugh. Let us go and tell him.”\n\n“We have been talking of you, Paul,” said the sexton. “We have thought,\nHester and myself, that as you had no home and we no child, we should\nall be the gainers by your staying with us. Do you consent?”\n\n“Consent!” echoed Paul in joyful surprise. “How can I ever repay your\nkindness?”\n\n“If you are the boy we take you for, we shall feel abundantly repaid.\nHester, we can give Paul the little bedroom where--where John used to\nsleep.”\n\nHis voice faltered a little, for John was the name of his boy, who had\nbeen drowned.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\nYOUNG STUPID.\n\n\nPaul found the sexton's dwelling very different from his last home, if\nthe Poorhouse under the charge of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge deserved such a\nname. His present home was an humble one, but he was provided with every\nneedful comfort, and the atmosphere of kindness which surrounded him,\ngave him a feeling of peace and happiness which he had not enjoyed for a\nlong time.\n\nPaul supposed that he would be at once set to work, and even then would\nhave accounted himself fortunate in possessing such a home.\n\nBut Mr. Cameron had other views for him.\n\n“Are you fond of studying?” asked the sexton, as they were all three\ngathered in the little sitting room, an evening or two after Paul first\ncame.\n\n“Very much!” replied our hero.\n\n“And would you like to go to school?”\n\n“What, here in New York?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Oh, very much indeed.”\n\n“I am glad to hear you say so, my lad. There is nothing like a good\neducation. If I had a son of my own, I would rather leave him that\nthan money, for while the last may be lost, the first never can be. And\nthough you are not my son, Paul, Providence has in a manner conducted\nyou to me, and I feel responsible for your future. So you shall go to\nschool next Monday morning, and I hope you will do yourself much credit\nthere.”\n\n“Thank you very much,” said Paul. “I feel very grateful, but----”\n\n“You surely are not going to object?” said the sexton.\n\n“No, but----”\n\n“Well, Paul, go on,” seeing that the boy hesitated.\n\n“Why,” said our hero, with a sense of delicacy which did him credit,\n“If I go to school, I shall not be able to earn my board, and shall be\nliving at your expense, though I have no claim upon you.”\n\n“Oh, is that all?” said the sexton cheerfully, “I was afraid that it was\nsomething more serious. As to that, I am not rich, and never expect to\nbe. But what little expense you will be will not ruin me. Besides, when\nyou are grown up and doing well, you can repay me, if I ever need it.”\n\n“That I will,” said Paul.\n\n“Mind, if I ever need it,--not otherwise. There, now, it's a bargain on\nthat condition. You haven't any other objection,” seeing that Paul still\nhesitated.\n\n“No, or at least I should like to ask your advice,” said Paul. “Just\nbefore my father died, he told me of a debt of five hundred dollars\nwhich he had not been able to pay. I saw that it troubled him, and I\npromised to pay it whenever I was able. I don't know but I ought to go\nto work so as to keep my promise.”\n\n“No,” said the sexton after a moment's reflection, “the best course will\nbe to go to school, at present. Knowledge is power, and a good education\nwill help you to make money by and by. I approve your resolution, my\nlad, and if you keep it resolutely in mind I have no doubt you will\naccomplish your object. But the quickest road to success is through the\nschoolroom. At present you are not able to earn much. Two or three years\nhence will be time enough.”\n\nPaul's face brightened as the sexton said this. He instinctively felt\nthat Mr. Cameron was right. He had never forgotten his father's dying\ninjunction, and this was one reason that impelled him to run away from\nthe Almshouse, because he felt that while he remained he never would\nbe in a situation to carry out his father's wishes. Now his duty was\nreconciled with his pleasure, and he gratefully accepted the sexton's\nsuggestions.\n\nThe next Monday morning, in accordance with the arrangement which had\njust been agreed upon, Paul repaired to school. He was at once placed in\na class, and lessons were assigned him.\n\nAt first his progress was not rapid. While living in Wrenville he had\nan opportunity only of attending a country school, kept less than six\nmonths in the year, and then not affording advantages to be compared\nwith those of a city school. During his father's sickness, besides, he\nhad been kept from school altogether. Of course all this lost time could\nnot be made up in a moment. Therefore it was that Paul lagged behind his\nclass.\n\nThere are generally some in every school, who are disposed to take\nunfair advantage of their schoolmates, or to ridicule those whom they\nconsider inferior to themselves.\n\nThere was one such in Paul's class. His name was George Dawkins.\n\nHe was rather a showy boy, and learned easily. He might have stood a\nclass above where he was, if he had not been lazy, and depended too much\non his natural talent. As it was, he maintained the foremost rank in his\nclass.\n\n“Better be the first man in a village than the second man in Rome,”\n he used to say; and as his present position not only gave him the\npre-eminence which he desired, but cost him very little exertion to\nmaintain, he was quite well satisfied with it.\n\nThis boy stood first in his class, while Paul entered at the foot.\n\nHe laughed unmercifully at the frequent mistakes of our hero, and\njeeringly dubbed him, “Young Stupid.”\n\n“Do you know what Dawkins calls you?” asked one of the boys.\n\n“No. What does he call me?” asked Paul, seriously.\n\n“He calls you 'Young Stupid.'”\n\nPaul's face flushed painfully. Ridicule was as painful to him as it is\nto most boys, and he felt the insult deeply.\n\n“I'd fight him if I were you,” was the volunteered advice of his\ninformant.\n\n“No,” said Paul. “That wouldn't mend the matter. Besides, I don't know\nbut he has some reason for thinking so.”\n\n“Don't call yourself stupid, do you?”\n\n“No, but I am not as far advanced as most boys of my age. That isn't my\nfault, though. I never had a chance to go to school much. If I had been\nto school all my life, as Dawkins has, it would be time to find out\nwhether I am stupid or not.”\n\n“Then you ain't going to do anything about it?”\n\n“Yes, I am.”\n\n“You said you wasn't going to fight him.”\n\n“That wouldn't do any good. But I'm going to study up and see if I can't\nget ahead of him. Don't you think that will be the best way of showing\nhim that he is mistaken?”\n\n“Yes, capital, but----”\n\n“But you think I can't do it, I suppose,” said Paul.\n\n“You know he is at the head of the class, and you are at the foot.”\n\n“I know that,” said Paul, resolutely. “But wait awhile and see.”\n\nIn some way George Dawkins learned that Paul had expressed the\ndetermination to dispute his place. It occasioned him considerable\namusement.\n\n“Halloa, Young Stupid,” he called out, at recess.\n\nPaul did not answer.\n\n“Why don't you answer when you are spoken to?” he asked angrily.\n\n“When you call me by my right name,” said Paul, quietly, “I will answer,\nand not before.”\n\n“You're mighty independent,” sneered Dawkins. “I don't know but I may\nhave to teach you manners.”\n\n“You had better wait till you are qualified,” said Paul, coolly.\n\nDawkins approached our hero menacingly, but Paul did not look in the\nleast alarmed, and he concluded to attack him with words only.\n\n“I understand you have set yourself up as my rival!” he said, mockingly.\n\n“Not just yet,” said Paul, “but in time I expect to be.”\n\n“So you expect my place,” said Dawkins, glancing about him.\n\n“We'll talk about that three months hence,” said Paul.\n\n“Don't hurt yourself studying,” sneered Dawkins, scornfully.\n\nTo this Paul did not deign a reply, but the same day he rose one in his\nclass.\n\nOur hero had a large stock of energy and determination. When he had once\nset his mind upon a thing, he kept steadily at work till he accomplished\nit. This is the great secret of success. It sometimes happens that a man\nwho has done nothing will at once accomplish a brilliant success by one\nspasmodic effort, but such cases are extremely rare.\n\n“Slow and sure wins the race,” is an old proverb that has a great deal\nof truth in it.\n\nPaul worked industriously.\n\nThe kind sexton and his wife, who noticed his assiduity, strove to\ndissuade him from working so steadily.\n\n“You are working too hard, Paul,” they said.\n\n“Do I look pale?” asked Paul, pointing with a smile to his red cheeks.\n\n“No, but you will before long.”\n\n“When I am, I will study less. But you know, Uncle Hugh,” so the sexton\ninstructed him to call him, “I want to make the most of my present\nadvantages. Besides, there's a particular boy who thinks I am stupid. I\nwant to convince him that he is mistaken.”\n\n“You are a little ambitious, then, Paul?”\n\n“Yes, but it isn't that alone. I know the value of knowledge, and I want\nto secure as much as I can.”\n\n“That is an excellent motive, Paul.”\n\n“Then you won't make me study less?”\n\n“Not unless I see you are getting sick.”\n\nPaul took good care of this. He knew how to play as well as to study,\nand his laugh on the playground was as merry as any. His cheerful,\nobliging disposition made him a favorite with his companions. Only\nGeorge Dawkins held out; he had, for some reason, imbibed a dislike for\nPaul.\n\nPaul's industry was not without effect. He gradually gained position in\nhis class.\n\n“Take care, Dawkins,” said one of his companions--the same one who had\nbefore spoken to Paul--“Paul Prescott will be disputing your place with\nyou. He has come up seventeen places in a month.”\n\n“Much good it'll do him,” said Dawkins, contemptuously.\n\n“For all that, you will have to be careful; I can tell you that.”\n\n“I'm not in the least afraid. I'm a little too firm in my position to be\nousted by Young Stupid.”\n\n“Just wait and see.”\n\nDawkins really entertained no apprehension. He had unbounded confidence\nin himself, and felt a sense of power in the rapidity with which he\ncould master a lesson. He therefore did not study much, and though he\ncould not but see that Paul was rapidly advancing, he rejected with\nscorn the idea that Young Stupid could displace him.\n\nThis, however, was the object at which Paul was aiming. He had not\nforgotten the nickname which Dawkins had given him, and this was the\nrevenge which he sought,--a strictly honorable one.\n\nAt length the day of his triumph came. At the end of the month the\nmaster read off the class-list, and, much to his disgust, George Dawkins\nfound himself playing second fiddle to Young Stupid.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\nBEN'S PRACTICAL JOKE.\n\n\nMrs. Mudge was in the back room, bending over a tub. It was washing-day,\nand she was particularly busy. She was a driving, bustling woman, and,\nwhatever might be her faults of temper, she was at least industrious and\nenergetic. Had Mr. Mudge been equally so, they would have been better\noff in a worldly point of view. But her husband was constitutionally\nlazy, and was never disposed to do more than was needful.\n\nMrs. Mudge was in a bad humor that morning. One of the cows had got\ninto the garden through a gap in the fence, and made sad havoc among the\ncabbages. Now if Mrs. Mudge had a weakness, it was for cabbages. She\nwas excessively fond of them, and had persuaded her husband to set out\na large number of plants from which she expected a large crop. They were\nplanted in one corner of the garden, adjoining a piece of land, which,\nsince mowing, had been used for pasturing the cows. There was a weak\nplace in the fence separating the two inclosures, and this Mrs. Mudge\nhad requested her husband to attend to. He readily promised this, and\nMrs. Mudge supposed it done, until that same morning, her sharp eyes had\ndetected old Brindle munching the treasured cabbages with a provoking\nair of enjoyment. The angry lady seized a broom, and repaired quickly to\nthe scene of devastation. Brindle scented the danger from afar, and beat\na disorderly retreat, trampling down the cabbages which she had hitherto\nspared. Leaping over the broken fence, she had just cleared the gap as\nthe broom-handle, missing her, came forcibly down upon the rail, and was\nsnapped in sunder by the blow.\n\nHere was a new vexation. Brindle had not only escaped scot-free, but the\nbroom, a new one, bought only the week before, was broken.\n\n“It's a plaguy shame,” said Mrs. Mudge, angrily. “There's my best broom\nbroken; cost forty-two cents only last week.”\n\nShe turned and contemplated the scene of devastation. This yielded her\nlittle consolation.\n\n“At least thirty cabbages destroyed by that scamp of a cow,” she\nexclaimed in a tone bordering on despair. “I wish I'd a hit her. If I'd\nbroken my broom over her back I wouldn't a cared so much. And it's all\nMudge's fault. He's the most shiftless man I ever see. I'll give him a\ndressing down, see if I don't.”\n\nMrs. Mudge's eyes snapped viciously, and she clutched the relics of the\nbroom with a degree of energy which rendered it uncertain what sort of a\ndressing down she intended for her husband.\n\nTen minutes after she had re-entered the kitchen, the luckless man made\nhis appearance. He wore his usual look, little dreaming of the storm\nthat awaited him.\n\n“I'm glad you've come,” said Mrs. Mudge, grimly.\n\n“What's amiss, now?” inquired Mudge, for he understood her look.\n\n“What's amiss?” blazed Mrs. Mudge. “I'll let you know. Do you see this?”\n\nShe seized the broken broom and flourished it in his face.\n\n“Broken your broom, have you? You must have been careless.”\n\n“Careless, was I?” demanded Mrs. Mudge, sarcastically. “Yes, of course,\nit's always I that am in fault.”\n\n“You haven't broken it over the back of any of the paupers, have you?”\n asked her husband, who, knowing his helpmeet's infirmity of temper,\nthought it possible she might have indulged in such an amusement.\n\n“If I had broken it over anybody's back it would have been yours,” said\nthe lady.\n\n“Mine! what have I been doing?”\n\n“It's what you haven't done,” said Mrs. Mudge. “You're about the laziest\nand most shiftless man I ever came across.”\n\n“Come, what does all this mean?” demanded Mr. Mudge, who was getting a\nlittle angry in his turn.\n\n“I'll let you know. Just look out of that window, will you?”\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Mudge, innocently, “I don't see anything in\nparticular.”\n\n“You don't!” said Mrs. Mudge with withering sarcasm. “Then you'd better\nput on your glasses. If you'd been here quarter of an hour ago, you'd\nhave seen Brindle among the cabbages.”\n\n“Did she do any harm?” asked Mr. Mudge, hastily.\n\n“There's scarcely a cabbage left,” returned Mrs. Mudge, purposely\nexaggerating the mischief done.\n\n“If you had mended that fence, as I told you to do, time and again, it\nwouldn't have happened.”\n\n“You didn't tell me but once,” said Mr. Mudge, trying to get up a feeble\ndefence.\n\n“Once should have been enough, and more than enough. You expect me to\nslave myself to death in the house, and see to all your work besides.\nIf I'd known what a lazy, shiftless man you were, at the time I married\nyou, I'd have cut off my right hand first.”\n\nBy this time Mr. Mudge had become angry.\n\n“If you hadn't married me, you'd a died an old maid,” he retorted.\n\nThis was too much for Mrs. Mudge to bear. She snatched the larger half\nof the broom, and fetched it down with considerable emphasis upon\nthe back of her liege lord, who, perceiving that her temper was up,\nretreated hastily from the kitchen; as he got into the yard he\ndescried Brindle, whose appetite had been whetted by her previous raid,\nre-entering the garden through the gap.\n\nIt was an unfortunate attempt on the part of Brindle. Mr. Mudge,\nangry with his wife, and smarting with the blow from the broomstick,\ndetermined to avenge himself upon the original cause of all the trouble.\nRevenge suggested craft. He seized a hoe, and crept stealthily to the\ncabbage-plot. Brindle, whose back was turned, did not perceive his\napproach, until she felt a shower of blows upon her back. Confused at\nthe unexpected attack she darted wildly away, forgetting the gap in the\nfence, and raced at random over beds of vegetables, uprooting beets,\nparsnips, and turnips, while Mr. Mudge, mad with rage, followed close in\nher tracks, hitting her with the hoe whenever he got a chance.\n\nBrindle galloped through the yard, and out at the open gate. Thence she\nran up the road at the top of her speed, with Mr. Mudge still pursuing\nher.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that Mr. Mudge was compelled to chase the\nterrified cow over two miles before he succeeded with the help of a\nneighbor in capturing her. All this took time. Meanwhile Mrs. Mudge at\nhome was subjected to yet another trial of her temper.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that Squire Newcome was Chairman of the\nOverseers of the Poor. In virtue of his office, he was expected to\nexercise a general supervision over the Almshouse and its management.\nIt was his custom to call about once a month to look after matters, and\nascertain whether any official action or interference was needed.\n\nBen saw his father take his gold-headed cane from behind the door, and\nstart down the road. He understood his destination, and instantly the\nplan of a stupendous practical joke dawned upon him.\n\n“It'll be jolly fun,” he said to himself, his eyes dancing with fun.\n“I'll try it, anyway.”\n\nHe took his way across the fields, so as to reach the Almshouse before\nhis father. He then commenced his plan of operations.\n\nMrs. Mudge had returned to her tub, and was washing away with bitter\nenergy, thinking over her grievances in the matter of Mr. Mudge, when a\nknock was heard at the front door.\n\nTaking her hands from the tub, she wiped them on her apron.\n\n“I wish folks wouldn't come on washing day!” she said in a tone of\nvexation.\n\nShe went to the door and opened it.\n\nThere was nobody there.\n\n“I thought somebody knocked,” thought she, a little mystified. “Perhaps\nI was mistaken.”\n\nShe went back to her tub, and had no sooner got her hands in the suds\nthan another knock was heard, this time on the back door.\n\n“I declare!” said she, in increased vexation, “There's another knock. I\nshan't get through my washing to-day.”\n\nAgain Mrs. Mudge wiped her hands on her apron, and went to the door.\n\nThere was nobody there.\n\nI need hardly say that it was Ben, who had knocked both times, and\ninstantly dodged round the corner of the house.\n\n“It's some plaguy boy,” said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes blazing with anger.\n“Oh, if I could only get hold of him!”\n\n“Don't you wish you could?” chuckled Ben to himself, as he caught a sly\nglimpse of the indignant woman.\n\nMeanwhile, Squire Newcome had walked along in his usual slow and\ndignified manner, until he had reached the front door of the Poorhouse,\nand knocked.\n\n“It's that plaguy boy again,” said Mrs. Mudge, furiously. “I won't go\nthis time, but if he knocks again, I'll fix him.”\n\nShe took a dipper of hot suds from the tub in which she had been\nwashing, and crept carefully into the entry, taking up a station close\nto the front door.\n\n“I wonder if Mrs. Mudge heard me knock,” thought Squire Newcome. “I\nshould think she might. I believe I will knock again.”\n\nThis time he knocked with his cane.\n\nRat-tat-tat sounded on the door.\n\nThe echo had not died away, when the door was pulled suddenly open, and\na dipper full of hot suds was dashed into the face of the astonished\nSquire, accompanied with, “Take that, you young scamp!”\n\n“Wh--what does all this mean?” gasped Squire Newcome, nearly strangled\nwith the suds, a part of which had found its way into his mouth.\n\n“I beg your pardon, Squire Newcome,” said the horrified Mrs. Mudge. “I\ndidn't mean it.”\n\n“What did you mean, then?” demanded Squire Newcome, sternly. “I think\nyou addressed me,--ahem!--as a scamp.”\n\n“Oh, I didn't mean you,” said Mrs. Mudge, almost out of her wits with\nperplexity.\n\n“Come in, sir, and let me give you a towel. You've no idea how I've been\ntried this morning.”\n\n“I trust,” said the Squire, in his stateliest tone, “you will be able\nto give a satisfactory explanation of this, ahem--extraordinary\nproceeding.”\n\nWhile Mrs. Mudge was endeavoring to sooth the ruffled dignity of the\naggrieved Squire, the “young scamp,” who had caused all the mischief,\nmade his escape through the fields.\n\n“Oh, wasn't it bully!” he exclaimed. “I believe I shall die of laughing.\nI wish Paul had been here to see it. Mrs. Mudge has got herself into a\nscrape, now, I'm thinking.”\n\nHaving attained a safe distance from the Poorhouse, Ben doubled himself\nup and rolled over and over upon the grass, convulsed with laughter.\n\n“I'd give five dollars to see it all over again,” he said to himself. “I\nnever had such splendid fun in my life.”\n\nPresently the Squire emerged, his tall dicky looking decidedly limp and\ndrooping, his face expressing annoyance and outraged dignity. Mrs. Mudge\nattended him to the door with an expression of anxious concern.\n\n“I guess I'd better make tracks,” said Ben to himself, “it won't do for\nthe old gentleman to see me here, or he may smell a rat.”\n\nHe accordingly scrambled over a stone wall and lay quietly hidden behind\nit till he judged it would be safe to make his appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\nMORE ABOUT BEN.\n\n\n“Benjamin,” said Squire Newcome, two days after the occurrence mentioned\nin the last chapter, “what made the dog howl so this morning? Was you a\ndoing anything to him?”\n\n“I gave him his breakfast,” said Ben, innocently. “Perhaps he was\nhungry, and howling for that.”\n\n“I do not refer to that,” said the Squire. “He howled as if in pain or\nterror. I repeat; was you a doing anything to him?”\n\nBen shifted from one foot to the other, and looked out of the window.\n\n“I desire a categorical answer,” said Squire Newcome.\n\n“Don't know what categorical means,” said Ben, assuming a perplexed\nlook.\n\n“I desire you to answer me IMMEGIATELY,” explained the Squire. “What was\nyou a doing to Watch?”\n\n“I was tying a tin-kettle to his tail,” said Ben, a little reluctantly.\n\n“And what was you a doing that for?” pursued the Squire.\n\n“I wanted to see how he would look,” said Ben, glancing demurely at his\nfather, out of the corner of his eye.\n\n“Did it ever occur to you that it must be disagreeable to Watch to have\nsuch an appendage to his tail?” queried the Squire.\n\n“I don't know,” said Ben.\n\n“How should you like to have a tin pail suspended to your--ahem! your\ncoat tail?”\n\n“I haven't got any coat tail,” said Ben, “I wear jackets. But I think I\nam old enough to wear coats. Can't I have one made, father?”\n\n“Ahem!” said the Squire, blowing his nose, “we will speak of that at\nsome future period.”\n\n“Fred Newell wears a coat, and he isn't any older than I am,” persisted\nBen, who was desirous of interrupting his father's inquiries.\n\n“I apprehend that we are wandering from the question,” said the Squire.\n“Would you like to be treated as you treated Watch?”\n\n“No,” said Ben, slowly, “I don't know as I should.”\n\n“Then take care not to repeat your conduct of this morning,” said his\nfather. “Stay a moment,” as Ben was about to leave the room hastily. “I\ndesire that you should go to the post-office and inquire for letters.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nBen left the room and sauntered out in the direction of the post-office.\n\nA chaise, driven by a stranger, stopped as it came up with him.\n\nThe driver looked towards Ben, and inquired, “Boy, is this the way to\nSparta?”\n\nBen, who was walking leisurely along the path, whistling as he went,\nnever turned his head.\n\n“Are you deaf, boy?” said the driver, impatiently. “I want to know if\nthis is the road to Sparta?”\n\nBen turned round.\n\n“Fine morning, sir,” he said politely.\n\n“I know that well enough without your telling me. Will you tell me\nwhether this is the road to Sparta?”\n\nBen put his hand to his ear, and seemed to listen attentively. Then he\nslowly shook his head, and said, “Would you be kind enough to speak a\nlittle louder, sir?”\n\n“The boy is deaf, after all,” said the driver to himself. “IS THIS THE\nROAD TO SPARTA?”\n\n“Yes, sir, this is Wrenville,” said Ben, politely.\n\n“Plague take it! he don't hear me yet. IS THIS THE ROAD TO SPARTA?”\n\n“Just a little louder, if you please,” said Ben, keeping his hand to his\near, and appearing anxious to hear.\n\n“Deaf as a post!” muttered the driver. “I couldn't scream any louder, if\nI should try. Go along.”\n\n“Poor man! I hope he hasn't injured his voice,” thought Ben, his eyes\ndancing with fun. “By gracious!” he continued a moment later, bursting\ninto a laugh, “if he isn't going to ask the way of old Tom Haven. He's\nas deaf as I pretended to be.”\n\nThe driver had reined up again, and inquired the way to Sparta.\n\n“What did you say?” said the old man, putting his hand to his ear. “I'm\nrather hard of hearing.”\n\nThe traveller repeated his question in a louder voice.\n\nThe old man shook his head.\n\n“I guess you'd better ask that boy,” he said, pointing to Ben, who by\nthis time had nearly come up with the chaise.\n\n“I have had enough of him,” said the traveller, disgusted. “I believe\nyou're all deaf in this town. I'll get out of it as soon as possible.”\n\nHe whipped up his horse, somewhat to the old man's surprise, and drove\nrapidly away.\n\nI desire my young readers to understand that I am describing Ben as he\nwas, and not as he ought to be. There is no doubt that he carried his\nlove of fun too far. We will hope that as he grows older, he will grow\nwiser.\n\nBen pursued the remainder of his way to the Post-office without any\nfurther adventure.\n\nEntering a small building appropriated to this purpose, he inquired for\nletters.\n\n“There's nothing for your father to-day,” said the post-master.\n\n“Perhaps there's something for me,--Benjamin Newcome, Esq.,” said Ben.\n\n“Let me see,” said the post-master, putting on his spectacles; “yes, I\nbelieve there is. Post-marked at New York, too. I didn't know you had\nany correspondents there.”\n\n“It's probably from the Mayor of New York,” said Ben, in a tone of\ncomical importance, “asking my advice about laying out Central Park.”\n\n“Probably it is,” said the postmaster. “It's a pretty thick\nletter,--looks like an official document.”\n\nBy this time, Ben, who was really surprised by the reception of the\nletter, had opened it. It proved to be from our hero, Paul Prescott, and\ninclosed one for Aunt Lucy.\n\n“Mr. Crosby,” said Ben, suddenly, addressing the postmaster, “you\nremember about Paul Prescott's running away from the Poorhouse?”\n\n“Yes, I didn't blame the poor boy a bit. I never liked Mudge, and they\nsay his wife is worse than he.”\n\n“Well, suppose the town should find out where he is, could they get him\nback again?”\n\n“Bless you! no. They ain't so fond of supporting paupers. If he's able\nto earn his own living, they won't want to interfere with him.”\n\n“Well, this letter is from him,” said Ben. “He's found a pleasant family\nin New York, who have adopted him.”\n\n“I'm glad of it,” said Mr. Crosby, heartily. “I always liked him. He was\na fine fellow.”\n\n“That's just what I think. I'll read his letter to you, if you would\nlike to hear it.”\n\n“I should, very much. Come in behind here, and sit down.”\n\nBen went inside the office, and sitting down on a stool, read Paul's\nletter. As our reader may be interested in the contents, we will take\nthe liberty of looking over Ben's shoulder while he reads.\n\nNew York, Oct. 10, 18--.\n\nDEAR BEN:--\n\nI have been intending to write to you before, knowing the kind interest\nwhich you take in me. I got safely to New York a few days after I left\nWrenville. I didn't have so hard a time as I expected, having fallen in\nwith a pedler, who was very kind to me, with whom I rode thirty or forty\nmiles. I wish I had time to tell all the adventures I met with on the\nway, but I must wait till I see you.\n\nWhen I got to the city, I was astonished to find how large it was. The\nfirst day I got pretty tired wandering about, and strayed into a church\nin the evening, not knowing where else to go. I was so tired I fell\nasleep there, and didn't wake up till morning. When I found myself\nlocked up in a great church, I was frightened, I can tell you. It was\nonly Thursday morning, and I was afraid I should have to stay there\ntill Sunday. If I had, I am afraid I should have starved to death. But,\nfortunately for me, the sexton came in the morning, and let me out. That\nwasn't all. He very kindly took me home with him, and then told me I\nmight live with him and go to school. I like him very much, and his wife\ntoo. I call them Uncle Hugh and Aunt Hester. When you write to me, you\nmust direct to the care of Mr. Hugh Cameron, 10 R---- Street. Then it\nwill be sure to reach me.\n\nI am going to one of the city schools. At first, I was a good deal\ntroubled because I was so far behind boys of my age. You know I hadn't\nbeen to school for a long time before I left Wrenville, on account of\nfather's sickness. But I studied pretty hard, and now I stand very well.\nI sometimes think, Ben, that you don't care quite so much about study\nas you ought to. I wish you would come to feel the importance of it. You\nmust excuse me saying this, as we have always been such good friends.\n\nI sometimes think of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, and wonder whether they miss\nme much. I am sure Mr. Mudge misses me, for now he is obliged to get up\nearly and milk, unless he has found another boy to do it. If he has, I\npity the boy. Write me what they said about my going away.\n\nI inclose a letter for Aunt Lucy Lee, which I should like to have you\ngive her with your own hands. Don't trust it to Mrs. Mudge, for she\ndoesn't like Aunt Lucy, and I don't think she would give it to her.\n\nWrite soon, Ben, and I will answer without delay, Your affectionate\nfriend, PAUL PRESCOTT.\n\n\n“That's a very good letter,” said Mr. Crosby; “I am glad Paul is doing\nso well. I should like to see him.”\n\n“So should I,” said Ben; “he was a prime fellow,--twice as good as I am.\nThat's true, what he said about my not liking study. I guess I'll try to\ndo better.”\n\n“You'll make a smart boy if you only try,” said the postmaster,\nwith whom Ben was rather a favorite, in spite of his mischievous\npropensities.\n\n“Thank you,” said Ben, laughing, “that's what my friend, the mayor of\nNew York, often writes me. But honestly, I know I can do a good deal\nbetter than I am doing now. I don't know but I shall turn over a new\nleaf. I suppose I like fun a little too well. Such jolly sport as I had\ncoming to the office this morning.”\n\nBen related the story of the traveller who inquired the way to Sparta,\nmuch to the amusement of the postmaster, who, in his enjoyment of the\njoke, forgot to tell Ben that his conduct was hardly justifiable.\n\n“Now,” said Ben, “as soon as I have been home, I must go and see my\nparticular friend, Mrs. Mudge. I'm a great favorite of hers,” he added,\nwith a sly wink.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\nMRS. MUDGE'S DISCOMFITURE.\n\n\nBen knocked at the door of the Poorhouse. In due time Mrs. Mudge\nappeared. She was a little alarmed on seeing Ben, not knowing how Squire\nNewcome might be affected by the reception she had given him on his last\nvisit. Accordingly she received him with unusual politeness.\n\n“How do you do, Master Newcome?” she inquired.\n\n“As well as could be expected,” said Ben, hesitatingly.\n\n“Why, is there anything the matter with you?” inquired Mrs. Mudge, her\ncuriosity excited by his manner of speaking.\n\n“No one can tell what I suffer from rheumatism,” said Ben, sadly.\n\nThis was very true, since not even Ben himself could have told.\n\n“You are very young to be troubled in that way,” said Mrs. Mudge, “and\nhow is your respected father, to-day?” she inquired, with some anxiety.\n\n“I was just going to ask you, Mrs. Mudge,” said Ben, “whether anything\nhappened to disturb him when he called here day before yesterday?”\n\n“Why,” said Mrs. Mudge, turning a little pale, “Nothing of any\nconsequence,--that is, not much. What makes you ask?”\n\n“I thought it might be so from his manner,” said Ben, enjoying Mrs.\nMudge's evident alarm.\n\n“There was a little accident,” said Mrs. Mudge, reluctantly. “Some\nmischievous boy had been knocking and running away; so, when your father\nknocked, I thought it might be he, and--and I believe I threw some\nwater on him. But I hope he has forgiven it, as it wasn't intentional.\nI should like to get hold of that boy,” said Mrs. Mudge, wrathfully, “I\nshould like to shake him up.”\n\n“Have you any idea who it was?” asked Ben, gravely.\n\n“No,” said Mrs. Mudge, “I haven't, but I shall try to find out. Whoever\nit is, he's a scamp.”\n\n“Very complimentary old lady,” thought Ben. He said in a sober\ntone, which would have imposed upon any one, “There are a good many\nmischievous boys around here.”\n\nMrs. Mudge grimly assented.\n\n“Oh, by the way, Mrs. Mudge,” asked Ben, suddenly, “have you ever heard\nanything of Paul Prescott since he left you?”\n\n“No,” snapped Mrs. Mudge, her countenance growing dark, “I haven't. But\nI can tell pretty well where he is.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“In the penitentiary. At any rate, if he isn't, he ought to be. But what\nwas you wanting?”\n\n“I want to see Mrs. Lee.”\n\n“Aunt Lucy Lee?”\n\n“Yes. I've got a letter for her.”\n\n“If you'll give me the letter I'll carry it to her.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Ben, “but I would like to see her.”\n\n“Never mind,” thought Mrs. Mudge, “I'll get hold of it yet. I shouldn't\nwonder at all if it was from that rascal, Paul.”\n\nPoor Paul! It was fortunate that he had some better friends than Mr. and\nMrs. Mudge, otherwise he would have been pretty poorly off.\n\nAunt Lucy came to the door. Ben placed the letter in her hands.\n\n“Is it from Paul?” she asked, hopefully.\n\n“Yes,” said Ben.\n\nShe opened it eagerly. “Is he well?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, well and happy,” said Ben, who treated the old lady, for whom he\nhad much respect, very differently from Mrs. Mudge.\n\n“I'm truly thankful for that,” said Aunt Lucy; “I've laid awake more\nthan one night thinking of him.”\n\n“So has Mrs. Mudge, I'm thinking,” said Ben, slyly.\n\nAunt Lucy laughed.\n\n“There isn't much love lost between them,” said Aunt Lucy, smiling. “He\nwas very badly treated here, poor boy.”\n\n“Was he, though?” repeated Mrs. Mudge? who had been listening at the\nkeyhole, but not in an audible voice. “Perhaps he will be again, if I\nget him back. I thought that letter was from Paul. I must get hold of it\nsome time to-day.”\n\n“I believe I must go,” said Ben. “If you answer the letter, I will put\nit into the office for you. I shall be passing here to-morrow.”\n\n“You are very kind,” said Aunt Lucy. “I am very much obliged to you for\nbringing me this letter to-day. You can't tell how happy it makes me. I\nhave been so afraid the dear boy might be suffering.”\n\n“It's no trouble at all,” said Ben.\n\n“She's a pretty good woman,” thought he, as he left the house. “I\nwouldn't play a trick on her for a good deal. But that Mrs. Mudge is a\nhard case. I wonder what she would have said if she had known that I was\nthe 'scamp' that troubled her so much Monday. If I had such a mother as\nthat, by jingo, I'd run away to sea.”\n\nMrs. Mudge was bent upon reading Aunt Lucy's letter. Knowing it to be\nfrom Paul, she had a strong curiosity to know what had become of him.\nIf she could only get him back! Her heart bounded with delight as she\nthought of the annoyances to which, in that case, she could subject him.\nIt would be a double triumph over him and Aunt Lucy, against whom she\nfelt that mean spite with which a superior nature is often regarded by\none of a lower order.\n\nAfter some reflection, Mrs. Mudge concluded that Aunt Lucy would\nprobably leave the letter in the little chest which was appropriated to\nher use, and which was kept in the room where she slept. The key of this\nchest had been lost, and although Aunt Lucy had repeatedly requested\nthat a new one should be obtained, Mrs. Mudge had seen fit to pay no\nattention to her request, as it would interfere with purposes of her\nown, the character of which may easily be guessed.\n\nAs she suspected, Paul's letter had been deposited in this chest.\n\nAccordingly, the same afternoon, she left her work in the kitchen in\norder to institute a search for it. As a prudent precaution, however,\nshe just opened the door of the common room, to make sure that Aunt Lucy\nwas at work therein.\n\nShe made her way upstairs, and entering the room in which the old lady\nlodged, together with two others, she at once went to the chest and\nopened it.\n\nShe began to rummage round among the old lady's scanty treasures, and at\nlength, much to her joy, happened upon the letter, laid carefully away\nin one corner of the chest. She knew it was the one she sought, from the\nrecent postmark, and the address, which was in the unformed handwriting\nof a boy. To make absolutely certain, she drew the letter from the\nenvelope and looked at the signature.\n\nShe was right, as she saw at a glance. It was from Paul.\n\n“Now I'll see what the little rascal has to say for himself,” she\nmuttered, “I hope he's in distress; oh, how I'd like to get hold of\nhim.”\n\nMrs. Mudge began eagerly to read the letter, not dreaming of\ninterruption. But she was destined to be disappointed. To account for\nthis we must explain that, shortly after Mrs. Mudge looked into the\ncommon room, Aunt Lucy was reminded of something essential, which she\nhad left upstairs. She accordingly laid down her work upon the chair in\nwhich she had been sitting, and went up to her chamber.\n\nMrs. Mudge was too much preoccupied to hear the advancing steps.\n\nAs the old lady entered the chamber, what was her mingled indignation\nand dismay at seeing Mrs. Mudge on her knees before _her_ chest, with\nthe precious letter, whose arrival had gladdened her so much, in her\nhands.\n\n“What are you doing there, Mrs. Mudge?” she said, sternly.\n\nMrs. Mudge rose from her knees in confusion. Even she had the grace to\nbe ashamed of her conduct.\n\n“Put down that letter,” said the old lady in an authoritative voice\nquite new to her.\n\nMrs. Mudge, who had not yet collected her scattered senses, did as she\nwas requested.\n\nAunt Lucy walked hastily to the chest, and closed it, first securing the\nletter, which she put in her pocket.\n\n“I hope it will be safe, now,” she said, rather contemptuously. “Ain't\nyou ashamed of yourself, Mrs. Mudge?”\n\n“Ashamed of myself!” shrieked that amiable lady, indignant with herself\nfor having quailed for a moment before the old lady.\n\n“What do you mean--you--you pauper?”\n\n“I may be a pauper,” said Aunt Lucy, calmly, “But I am thankful to\nsay that I mind my own business, and don't meddle with other people's\nchests.”\n\nA red spot glowed on either cheek of Mrs. Mudge. She was trying hard to\nfind some vantage-ground over the old lady.\n\n“Do you mean to say that I don't mind my business?” she blustered,\nfolding her arms defiantly.\n\n“What were you at my trunk for?” said the old lady, significantly.\n\n“Because it was my duty,” was the brazen reply.\n\nMrs. Mudge had rapidly determined upon her line of defense, and thought\nit best to carry the war into the enemy's country.\n\n“Yes, I felt sure that your letter was from Paul Prescott, and as he ran\naway from my husband and me, who were his lawful guardians, it was my\nduty to take that means of finding out where he is. I knew that you were\nin league with him, and would do all you could to screen him. This is\nwhy I went to your chest, and I would do it again, if necessary.”\n\n“Perhaps you have been before,” said Aunt Lucy, scornfully. “I think\nI understand, now, why you were unwilling to give me another key.\nFortunately there has been nothing there until now to reward your\nsearch.”\n\n“You impudent trollop!” shrieked Mrs. Mudge, furiously.\n\nHer anger was the greater, because Aunt Lucy was entirely correct in her\nsupposition that this was not the first visit her landlady had made to\nthe little green chest.\n\n“I'll give Paul the worst whipping he ever had, when I get him back,”\n said Mrs. Mudge, angrily.\n\n“He is beyond your reach, thank Providence,” said Aunt Lucy, whose\nequanimity was not disturbed by this menace, which she knew to be an\nidle one. “That is enough for you to know. I will take care that you\nnever have another chance to see this letter. And if you ever go to my\nchest again”--\n\n“Well, ma'am, what then?”\n\n“I shall appeal for protection to 'Squire Newcome.”\n\n“Hoity, toity,” said Mrs. Mudge, but she was a little alarmed,\nnevertheless, as such an appeal would probably be prejudicial to her\ninterest.\n\nSo from time to time Aunt Lucy received, through Ben, letters from Paul,\nwhich kept her acquainted with his progress at school. These letters\nwere very precious to the old lady, and she read them over many times.\nThey formed a bright link of interest which bound her to the outside\nworld, and enabled her to bear up with greater cheerfulness against the\ntyranny of Mrs. Mudge.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\nPAUL OBTAINS A SITUATION.\n\n\nThe month after Paul Prescott succeeded in reaching the head of his\nclass, George Dawkins exerted himself to rise above him. He studied\nbetter than usual, and proved in truth a formidable rival. But Paul's\nspirit was roused. He resolved to maintain his position if possible. He\nhad now become accustomed to study, and it cost him less effort. When\nthe end of the month came, there was considerable speculation in the\nminds of the boys as to the result of the rivalry. The majority had\nfaith in Paul, but there were some who, remembering how long Dawkins had\nbeen at the head of the class, thought he would easily regain his lost\nrank.\n\nThe eventful day, the first of the month, at length came, and the\nclass-list was read.\n\nPaul Prescott ranked first.\n\nGeorge Dawkins ranked second.\n\nA flush spread over the pale face of Dawkins, and he darted a malignant\nglance at Paul, who was naturally pleased at having retained his rank.\n\nDawkins had his satellites. One of these came to him at recess, and\nexpressed his regret that Dawkins had failed of success.\n\nDawkins repelled the sympathy with cold disdain.\n\n“What do you suppose I care for the head of the class?” he demanded,\nhaughtily.\n\n“I thought you had been studying for it.”\n\n“Then you thought wrong. Let the sexton's son have it, if he wants it.\nIt would be of no use to me, as I leave this school at the end of the\nweek.”\n\n“Leave school!”\n\nThe boys gathered about Dawkins, curiously.\n\n“Is it really so, Dawkins?” they inquired.\n\n“Yes,” said Dawkins, with an air of importance; “I shall go to a private\nschool, where the advantages are greater than here. My father does not\nwish me to attend a public school any longer.”\n\nThis statement was made on the spur of the moment, to cover the\nmortification which his defeat had occasioned him. It proved true,\nhowever. On his return home, Dawkins succeeded in persuading his father\nto transfer him to a private school, and he took away his books at the\nend of the week. Had he recovered his lost rank there is no doubt that\nhe would have remained.\n\nTruth to tell, there were few who mourned much for the departure of\nGeorge Dawkins. He had never been a favorite. His imperious temper and\narrogance rendered this impossible.\n\nAfter he left school, Paul saw little of him for two or three years.\nAt their first encounter Paul bowed and spoke pleasantly, but Dawkins\nlooked superciliously at him without appearing to know him.\n\nPaul's face flushed proudly, and afterwards he abstained from making\nadvances which were likely to be repulsed. He had too much self-respect\nto submit voluntarily to such slights.\n\nMeanwhile Paul's school life fled rapidly. It was a happy time,--happy\nin its freedom from care, and happy for him, though all school boys do\nnot appreciate that consideration, in the opportunities for improvement\nwhich it afforded. These opportunities, it is only just to Paul to say,\nwere fully improved. He left school with an enviable reputation, and\nwith the good wishes of his schoolmates and teachers.\n\nPaul was now sixteen years old, a stout, handsome boy, with a frank,\nopen countenance, and a general air of health which formed quite a\ncontrast to the appearance he presented when he left the hospitable\nmansion which Mr. Nicholas Mudge kept open at the public expense.\n\nPaul was now very desirous of procuring a situation. He felt that it was\ntime he was doing something for himself. He was ambitious to relieve the\nkind sexton and his wife of some portion, at least, of the burden of his\nsupport.\n\nBesides, there was the legacy of debt which his father had bequeathed\nhim. Never for a moment had Paul forgotten it. Never for a moment had he\nfaltered in his determination to liquidate it at whatever sacrifice to\nhimself.\n\n“My father's name shall be cleared,” he said to himself, proudly.\n“Neither Squire Conant nor any one else shall have it in his power to\ncast reproach upon his memory.”\n\nThe sexton applauded his purpose.\n\n“You are quite right, Paul,” he said. “But you need not feel in haste.\nObtain your education first, and the money will come by-and-by. As long\nas you repay the amount, principal and interest, you will have done all\nthat you are in honor bound to do. Squire Conant, as I understand from\nyou, is a rich man, so that he will experience no hardship in waiting.”\n\nPaul was now solicitous about a place. The sexton had little influence,\nso that he must depend mainly upon his own inquiries.\n\nHe went into the reading-room of the Astor House every day to look over\nthe advertised wants in the daily papers. Every day he noted down\nsome addresses, and presented himself as an applicant for a position.\nGenerally, however, he found that some one else had been before him.\n\nOne day his attention was drawn to the following advertisement.\n\n\n“WANTED. A smart, active, wide-awake boy, of sixteen or seventeen, in a\nretail dry-goods store. Apply immediately at--Broadway.”\n\nPaul walked up to the address mentioned. Over the door he read, “Smith &\nThompson.” This, then, was the firm that had advertised.\n\nThe store ran back some distance. There appeared to be six or eight\nclerks in attendance upon quite a respectable number of customers.\n\n“Is Mr. Smith in?” inquired Paul, of the nearest clerk.\n\n“You'll find him at the lower end of the store. How many yards, ma'am?”\n\nThis last was of course addressed to a customer.\n\nPaul made his way, as directed, to the lower end of the store.\n\nA short, wiry, nervous man was writing at a desk.\n\n“Is Mr. Smith in?” asked Paul.\n\n“My name; what can I do for you?” said the short man, crisply.\n\n“I saw an advertisement in the Tribune for a boy.”\n\n“And you have applied for the situation?” said Mr. Smith.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“How old are you?” with a rapid glance at our hero.\n\n“Sixteen--nearly seventeen.”\n\n“I suppose that means that you will be seventeen in eleven months and a\nhalf.”\n\n“No, sir,” said Paul, “I shall be seventeen in three months.”\n\n“All right. Most boys call themselves a year older. What's your name?”\n\n“Paul Prescott.”\n\n“P. P. Any relation to Fanny Fern?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Paul, rather astonished.\n\n“Didn't know but you might be. P. P. and F. F. Where do you live?”\n\nPaul mentioned the street and number.\n\n“That's well, you are near by,” said Mr. Smith. “Now, are you afraid of\nwork?”\n\n“No sir,” said Paul, smiling, “not much.”\n\n“Well, that's important; how much wages do you expect?”\n\n“I suppose,” said Paul, hesitating, “I couldn't expect very much at\nfirst.”\n\n“Of course not; green, you know. What do you say to a dollar a week?”\n\n“A dollar a week!” exclaimed Paul, in dismay, “I hoped to get enough to\npay for my board.”\n\n“Nonsense. There are plenty of boys glad enough to come for a dollar a\nweek. At first, you know. But I'll stretch a point with you, and offer\nyou a dollar and a quarter. What do you say?”\n\n“How soon could I expect to have my wages advanced?” inquired our hero,\nwith considerable anxiety.\n\n“Well,” said Smith, “at the end of a month or two.”\n\n“I'll go home and speak to my uncle about it,” said Paul, feeling\nundecided.\n\n“Can't keep the place open for you. Ah, there's another boy at the\ndoor.”\n\n“I'll accept,” said Paul, jumping to a decision. He had applied in so\nmany different quarters without success, that he could not make up his\nmind to throw away this chance, poor as it seemed.\n\n“When shall I come?”\n\n“Come to-morrow.”\n\n“At what time, sir?”\n\n“At seven o'clock.”\n\nThis seemed rather early. However, Paul was prepared to expect some\ndiscomforts, and signified that he would come.\n\nAs he turned to go away, another boy passed him, probably bent on the\nsame errand with himself.\n\nPaul hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry. He had expected at least\nthree dollars a week, and the descent to a dollar and a quarter was\nrather disheartening. Still, he was encouraged by the promise of a rise\nat the end of a month or two,--so on the whole he went home cheerful.\n\n“Well, Paul, what luck to-day?” asked Mr. Cameron, who had just got home\nas Paul entered.\n\n“I've got a place, Uncle Hugh.”\n\n“You have,--where?”\n\n“With Smith & Thompson, No.--Broadway.”\n\n“What sort of a store? I don't remember the name.”\n\n“It is a retail dry-goods store.”\n\n“Did you like the looks of your future employer?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Paul, hesitating, “He looked as if he might be a\npretty sharp man in business, but I have seen others that I would rather\nwork for. However, beggars mustn't be choosers. But there was one thing\nI was disappointed about.”\n\n“What was that, Paul?”\n\n“About the wages.”\n\n“How much will they give you?”\n\n“Only a dollar and a quarter a week, at first.”\n\n“That is small, to be sure.”\n\n“The most I think of, Uncle Hugh, is, that I shall still be an expense\nto you. I hoped to get enough to be able to pay my board from the\nfirst.”\n\n“My dear boy,” said the sexton, kindly, “don't trouble yourself on that\nscore. It costs little more for three than for two, and the little I\nexpend on your account is richly made up by the satisfaction we feel in\nyour society, and your good conduct.”\n\n“You say that to encourage me, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul. “You have done\nall for me. I have done nothing for you.”\n\n“No, Paul, I spoke the truth. Hester and I have both been happier since\nyou came to us. We hope you will long remain with us. You are already as\ndear to us as the son that we lost.”\n\n“Thank you, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, in a voice tremulous with feeling.\n“I will do all I can to deserve your kindness.”\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\nSMITH AND THOMPSON'S YOUNG MAN.\n\n\nAt seven o'clock the next morning Paul stood before Smith & Thompson's\nstore.\n\nAs he came up on one side, another boy came down on the other, and\ncrossed the street.\n\n“Are you the new boy?” he asked, surveying Paul attentively.\n\n“I suppose so,” said Paul. “I've engaged to work for Smith & Thompson.”\n\n“All right. I'm glad to see you,” said the other.\n\nThis looked kind, and Paul thanked him for his welcome.\n\n“O.” said the other, bursting into a laugh, “you needn't trouble\nyourself about thanking me. I'm glad you've come, because now I shan't\nhave to open the store and sweep out. Just lend a hand there; I'll help\nyou about taking down the shutters this morning, and to-morrow you'll\nhave to get along alone.”\n\nThe two boys opened the store.\n\n“What's your name?” asked Paul's new acquaintance.\n\n“Paul Prescott. What is yours?”\n\n“Nicholas Benton. You may call me MR. Benton.”\n\n“Mr. Benton?” repeated Paul in some astonishment.\n\n“Yes; I'm a young man now. I've been Smith & Thompson's boy till now.\nNow I'm promoted.”\n\nPaul looked at MR. Benton with some amusement. That young man was\nsomewhat shorter than himself, and sole proprietor of a stock of pale\nyellow hair which required an abundant stock of bear's grease to keep\nit in order. His face was freckled and expressionless. His eyebrows and\neyelashes were of the same faded color. He was dressed, however,\nwith some pretensions to smartness. He wore a blue necktie, of large\ndimensions, fastened by an enormous breast-pin, which, in its already\ntarnished splendor, suggested strong doubts as to the apparent gold\nbeing genuine.\n\n“There's the broom, Paul,” said Mr. Benton, assuming a graceful position\non the counter.\n\n“You'll have to sweep out; only look sharp about raising a dust, or\nSmith'll be into your wool.”\n\n“What sort of a man is Mr. Smith?” asked Paul, with some curiosity.\n\n“O, he's an out and outer. Sharp as a steel trap. He'll make you toe the\nmark.”\n\n“Do you like him?” asked Paul, not quite sure whether he understood his\nemployer's character from the description.\n\n“I don't like him well enough to advise any of my folks to trade with\nhim,” said Mr. Benton.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“He'd cheat 'em out of their eye teeth if they happened to have any,”\n said the young man coolly, beginning to pick his teeth with a knife.\n\nPaul began to doubt whether he should like Mr. Smith.\n\n“I say,” said Mr. Benton after a pause, “have you begun to shave yet?”\n\nPaul looked up to see if his companion were in earnest.\n\n“No,” said he; “I haven't got along as far as that. Have you?”\n\n“I,” repeated the young man, a little contemptuously, “of course I have.\nI've shaved for a year and a half.”\n\n“Do you find it hard shaving?” asked Paul, a little slyly.\n\n“Well, my beard is rather stiff,” said the late BOY, with an important\nair, “but I've got used to it.”\n\n“Ain't you rather young to shave, Nicholas?” asked Paul.\n\n“Mr. Benton, if you please.”\n\n“I mean, Mr. Benton.”\n\n“Perhaps I was when I begun. But now I am nineteen.”\n\n“Nineteen?”\n\n“Yes, that is to say, I'm within a few months of being nineteen. What do\nyou think of my moustache?”\n\n“I hadn't noticed it.”\n\n“The store's rather dark,” muttered Mr. Benton, who seemed a little\nannoyed by this answer. “If you'll come a little nearer you can see it.”\n\nDrawing near, Paul, after some trouble, descried a few scattering hairs.\n\n“Yes,” said he, wanting to laugh, “I see it.”\n\n“Coming on finely, isn't it?” asked Mr. Nicholas Benton, complacently.\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, rather doubtfully.\n\n“I don't mind letting you into a secret,” said Benton, affably, “if you\nwon't mention it. I've been using some of the six weeks' stuff.”\n\n“The what?” asked Paul, opening his eyes.\n\n“Haven't you heard of it?” inquired Benton, a little contemptuously.\n“Where have you been living all your life? Haven't you seen it\nadvertised,--warranted to produce a full set of whiskers or moustaches\nupon the smoothest face, etc. I got some a week ago, only a dollar. Five\nweeks from now you'll see something that'll astonish you.”\n\nPaul was not a little amused by his new companion, and would have\nlaughed, but that he feared to offend him.\n\n“You'd better get some,” said Mr. Benton. “I'll let you just try mine\nonce, if you want to.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Paul; “I don't think I want to have a moustache just\nyet.”\n\n“Well, perhaps you're right. Being a boy, perhaps it wouldn't be\nadvisable.”\n\n“When does Mr. Smith come in?”\n\n“Not till nine.”\n\n“And the other clerks?”\n\n“About eight o'clock. I shan't come till eight, to-morrow morning.”\n\n“There's one thing I should like to ask you,” said Paul. “Of course you\nwon't answer unless you like.”\n\n“Out with it.”\n\n“How much does Mr. Smith pay you?”\n\n“Ahem!” said Benton, “what does he pay you?”\n\n“A dollar and a quarter a week.”\n\n“He paid me a dollar and a half to begin with.”\n\n“Did he? He wanted me to come first at a dollar.”\n\n“Just like him. Didn't I tell you he was an out and outer? He'll be sure\nto take you in if you will let him.”\n\n“But,” said Paul, anxiously, “he said he'd raise it in a month or two.”\n\n“He won't offer to; you'll have to tease him. And then how much'll he\nraise it? Not more than a quarter. How much do you think I get now?”\n\n“How long have you been here?”\n\n“A year and a half.”\n\n“Five dollars a week,” guessed Paul.\n\n“Five! he only gives me two and a half. That is, he hasn't been paying\nme but that. Now, of course, he'll raise, as I've been promoted.”\n\n“How much do you expect to get now?”\n\n“Maybe four dollars, and I'm worth ten any day. He's a mean old\nskinflint, Smith is.”\n\nThis glimpse at his own prospects did not tend to make Paul feel very\ncomfortable. He could not repress a sigh of disappointment when he\nthought of this mortifying termination of all his brilliant prospects.\nHe had long nourished the hope of being able to repay the good sexton\nfor his outlay in his behalf, besides discharging the debt which his\nfather had left behind him. Now there seemed to be little prospect of\neither. He had half a mind to resign his place immediately upon the\nentrance of Mr. Smith, but two considerations dissuaded him; one, that\nthe sum which he was to receive, though small, would at least buy his\nclothes, and besides, he was not at all certain of obtaining another\nsituation.\n\nWith a sigh, therefore, he went about his duties.\n\nHe had scarcely got the store ready when some of the clerks entered, and\nthe business of the day commenced. At nine Mr. Smith appeared.\n\n“So you're here, Peter,” remarked he, as he caught sight of our hero.\n\n“Paul,” corrected the owner of that name.\n\n“Well, well, Peter or Paul, don't make much difference. Both were\napostles, if I remember right. All ready for work, eh?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Paul, neither very briskly nor cheerfully.\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Smith, after a pause, “I guess I'll put you into the\ncalico department. Williams, you may take him under your wing. And now\nPeter,--all the same, Paul,--I've got a word or two to say to you, as I\nalways do to every boy who comes into my store. Don't forget what you're\nhere for? It's to sell goods. Take care to sell something to every man,\nwoman, and child, that comes in your way. That's the way to do business.\nFollow it up, and you'll be a rich man some day.”\n\n“But suppose they don't want anything?” said Paul.\n\n“Make 'em want something,” returned Smith, “Don't let 'em off without\nbuying. That's my motto. However, you'll learn.”\n\nSmith bustled off, and began in his nervous way to exercise a general\nsupervision over all that was going on in the store. He seemed to be all\neyes. While apparently entirely occupied in waiting upon a customer, he\ntook notice of all the customers in the store, and could tell what they\nbought, and how much they paid.\n\nPaul listened attentively to the clerk under whom he was placed for\ninstruction.\n\n“What's the price of this calico?” inquired a common-looking woman.\n\n“A shilling a yard, ma'am,” (this was not in war times.)\n\n“It looks rather coarse.”\n\n“Coarse, ma'am! What can you be thinking of? It is a superfine piece of\ngoods. We sell more of it than of any other figure. The mayor's wife was\nin here yesterday, and bought two dress patterns off of it.”\n\n“Did she?” asked the woman, who appeared favorably impressed by this\ncircumstance.\n\n“Yes, and she promised to send her friends here after some of it. You'd\nbetter take it while you can get it.”\n\n“Will it wash?”\n\n“To be sure it will.”\n\n“Then I guess you may cut me off ten yards.”\n\nThis was quickly done, and the woman departed with her purchase.\n\nFive minutes later, another woman entered with a bundle of the same\nfigured calico.\n\nSeeing her coming, Williams hastily slipped the remnant of the piece out\nof sight.\n\n“I got this calico here,” said the newcomer, “one day last week. You\nwarranted it to wash, but I find it won't. Here's a piece I've tried.”\n\nShe showed a pattern, which had a faded look.\n\n“You've come to the wrong store,” said Williams, coolly. “You must have\ngot the calico somewhere else.”\n\n“No, I'm sure I got it here. I remember particularly buying it of you.”\n\n“You've got a better memory than I have, then. We haven't got a piece of\ncalico like that in the store.”\n\nPaul listened to this assertion with unutterable surprise.\n\n“I am quite certain I bought it here,” said the woman, perplexed.\n\n“Must have been the next store,--Blake & Hastings. Better go over\nthere.”\n\nThe woman went out.\n\n“That's the way to do business,” said Williams, winking at Paul.\n\nPaul said nothing, but he felt more than ever doubtful about retaining\nhis place.\n\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\nMR. BENTON'S ADVENTURE.\n\n\nOne evening, about a fortnight after his entrance into Smith &\nThompson's employment, Paul was putting up the shutters, the business\nof the day being over. It devolved upon him to open and close the store,\nand usually he was the last one to go home.\n\nThis evening, however, Mr. Nicholas Benton graciously remained behind\nand assisted Paul in closing the store. This was unusual, and surprised\nPaul a little. It was soon explained, however.\n\n“Good-night, Nicholas,--I mean, Mr. Benton,” said Paul.\n\n“Not quite yet. I want you to walk a little way with me this evening.”\n\nPaul hesitated.\n\n“Come, no backing out. I want to confide to you a very important\nsecret.”\n\nHe looked so mysterious that Paul's curiosity was aroused, and\nreflecting that it was yet early, he took his companion's proffered arm,\nand sauntered along by his side.\n\n“What's the secret?” he asked at length, perceiving that Nicholas was\nsilent.\n\n“Wait till we get to a more retired place.”\n\nHe turned out of Broadway into a side street, where the passers were\nless numerous.\n\n“I don't think you could guess,” said the young man, turning towards our\nhero.\n\n“I don't think I could.”\n\n“And yet,” continued Benton, meditatively, “it is possible that you may\nhave noticed something in my appearance just a little unusual, within\nthe last week. Haven't you, now?”\n\nPaul could not say that he had.\n\nMr. Benton looked a little disappointed.\n\n“Nobody can tell what has been the state of my feelings,” he resumed\nafter a pause.\n\n“You ain't sick?” questioned Paul, hastily.\n\n“Nothing of the sort, only my appetite has been a good deal affected.\nI don't think I have eaten as much in a week as you would in a day,” he\nadded, complacently.\n\n“If I felt that way I should think I was going to be sick,” said Paul.\n\n“I'll let you into the secret,” said Mr. Benton, lowering his voice, and\nlooking carefully about him, to make sure that no one was within hearing\ndistance--“I'M IN LOVE.”\n\nThis seemed so utterly ludicrous to Paul, that he came very near losing\nMr. Benton's friendship forever by bursting into a hearty laugh.\n\n“I didn't think of that,” he said.\n\n“It's taken away my appetite, and I haven't been able to sleep nights,”\n continued Mr. Benton, in a cheerful tone. “I feel just as Howard\nCourtenay did in the great story that's coming out in the Weekly Budget.\nYou've read it, haven't you?”\n\n“I don't think I have,” said Paul.\n\n“Then you ought to. It's tiptop. It's rather curious too that the lady\nlooks just as Miranda does, in the same story.”\n\n“How is that?”\n\n“Wait a minute, and I'll read the description.”\n\nMr. Benton pulled a paper from his pocket,--the last copy of the Weekly\nBudget,--and by the light of a street lamp read the following extract to\nhis amused auditor.\n\n“Miranda was just eighteen. Her form was queenly and majestic. Tall and\nstately, she moved among her handmaidens with a dignity which\nrevealed her superior rank. Her eyes were dark as night. Her luxuriant\ntresses,--there, the rest is torn off,” said Mr. Benton, in a tone of\nvexation.\n\n“She is tall, then?” said Paul.\n\n“Yes, just like Miranda.”\n\n“Then,” said our hero, in some hesitation, “I should think she would not\nbe very well suited to you.”\n\n“Why not?” asked Mr. Benton, quickly.\n\n“Because,” said Paul, “you're rather short, you know.”\n\n“I'm about the medium height,” said Mr. Benton, raising himself upon his\ntoes as he spoke.\n\n“Not quite,” said Paul, trying not to laugh.\n\n“I'm as tall as Mr. Smith,” resumed Mr. Benton, in a tone which warned\nPaul that this was a forbidden subject. “But you don't ask me who she\nis.”\n\n“I didn't know as you would be willing to tell.”\n\n“I shan't tell any one but you. It's Miss Hawkins,--firm of Hawkins &\nBrewer. That is, her father belongs to the firm, not she. And Paul,”\n here he clutched our hero's arm convulsively, “I've made a declaration\nof my love, and--and----”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“She has answered my letter.”\n\n“Has she?” asked Paul with some curiosity, “What did she say?”\n\n“She has written me to be under her window this evening.”\n\n“Why under her window? why didn't she write you to call?”\n\n“Probably she will, but it's more romantic to say, 'be under my\nwindow.'”\n\n“Well, perhaps it is; only you know I don't know much about such\nthings.”\n\n“Of course not, Paul,” said Mr. Benton; “you're only a boy, you know.”\n\n“Are you going to be under her window, Nich,--I mean Mr. Benton?”\n\n“Of course. Do you think I would miss the appointment? No earthly power\ncould prevent my doing it.”\n\n“Then I had better leave you,” said Paul, making a movement to go.\n\n“No, I want you to accompany me as far as the door. I feel--a little\nagitated. I suppose everybody does when they are in love,” added Mr.\nBenton, complacently.\n\n“Well,” said Paul, “I will see you to the door, but I can't stay, for\nthey will wonder at home what has become of me.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“Are we anywhere near the house?”\n\n“Yes, it's only in the next street,” said Mr. Benton, “O, Paul, how my\nheart beats! You can't imagine how I feel!”\n\nMr. Benton gasped for breath, and looked as if he had swallowed a fish\nbone, which he had some difficulty in getting down.\n\n“You'll know how to understand my feelings sometime, Paul,” said Mr.\nBenton; “when your time comes, I will remember your service of to-night,\nand I will stand by you.”\n\nPaul inwardly hoped that he should never fall in love, if it was likely\nto affect him in the same way as his companion, but he thought it best\nnot to say so.\n\nBy this time they had come in sight of a three-story brick house, with\nBenjamin Hawkins on the door-plate.\n\n“That's the house,” said Mr. Benton, in an agitated whisper.\n\n“Is it?”\n\n“Yes, and that window on the left-hand side is the window of her\nchamber.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“She told me in the letter.”\n\n“And where are you to stand?”\n\n“Just underneath, as the clock strikes nine. It must be about the time.”\n\nAt that moment the city clock struck nine.\n\nMr. Benton left Paul, and crossing the street, took up his position\nbeneath the window of his charmer, beginning to sing, in a thin, piping\nvoice, as preconcerted between them--\n\n     “Ever of thee,\n     I'm fo-o-ondly dreaming.”\n\nThe song was destined never to be finished.\n\nFrom his post in a doorway opposite, Paul saw the window softly open. He\ncould distinguish a tall female figure, doubtless Miss Hawkins herself.\nShe held in her hand a pitcher of water, which she emptied with\nwell-directed aim full upon the small person of her luckless admirer.\n\nThe falling column struck upon his beaver, thence spreading on all\nsides. His carefully starched collar became instantly as limp as a rag,\nwhile his coat suffered severely from the shower.\n\nHis tuneful accents died away in dismay.\n\n“Ow!” he exclaimed, jumping at least a yard, and involuntarily shaking\nhimself like a dog, “who did that?”\n\nThere was no answer save a low, musical laugh from the window above,\nwhich was involuntarily echoed by Paul.\n\n“What do you mean by laughing at me?” demanded Mr. Benton, smarting with\nmortification, as he strode across the street, trying to dry his hat\nwith the help of his handkerchief, “Is this what you call friendship?”\n\n“Excuse me,” gasped Paul, “but I really couldn't help it.”\n\n“I don't see anything to laugh at,” continued Mr. Benton, in a resentful\ntone; “because I have been subjected to unmanly persecution, you must\nlaugh at me, instead of extending to me the sympathy of a friend.”\n\n“I suppose you won't think of her any more,” said Paul, recovering\nhimself.\n\n“Think of her!” exclaimed Mr. Benton, “would you have me tear her from\nmy heart, because her mercenary parent chooses to frown upon our love,\nand follow me with base persecution.”\n\n“Her parent!”\n\n“Yes, it was he who threw the water upon me. But it shall not avail,”\n the young man continued, folding his arms, and speaking in a tone of\nresolution, “bolts and bars shall not keep two loving hearts asunder.”\n\n“But it wasn't her father,” urged Paul, perceiving that Mr. Benton was\nunder a mistake.\n\n“Who was it, then?”\n\n“It was the young lady herself.”\n\n“Who threw the water upon me? It is a base slander.”\n\n“But I saw her.”\n\n“Saw who?”\n\n“A tall young lady with black hair.”\n\n“And was it she who threw the water?” asked Mr. Benton, aghast at this\nunexpected revelation.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then she did it at the command of her proud parent.”\n\nPaul did not dispute this, since it seemed to comfort Mr. Benton. It is\ndoubtful, however, whether the young man believed it himself, since he\nstraightway fell into a fit of gloomy abstraction, and made no response\nwhen Paul bade him “good-night.”\n\n\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\nPAUL LOSES HIS SITUATION AND GAINS A FRIEND.\n\n\nPaul had a presentiment that he should not long remain in the employ\nof Smith & Thompson; it was not many weeks before this presentiment was\nverified.\n\nAfter having received such instruction as was necessary, the calico\ndepartment was left in Paul's charge. One day a customer in turning over\nthe patterns shown her took up a piece which Paul knew from complaints\nmade by purchasers would not wash.\n\n“This is pretty,” said she, “it is just what I have been looking for.\nYou may cut me off twelve yards.”\n\n“Yes, ma'am.”\n\n“Wait a minute, though,” interposed the lady, “will it wash?”\n\n“I don't think it will,” said Paul, frankly, “there have been some\ncomplaints made about that.”\n\n“Then I shall not want it. Let me see what else you have got.”\n\nThe customer finally departed, having found nothing to suit her.\n\nNo sooner had she left the store than Mr. Smith called Paul.\n\n“Well, did you sell that lady anything?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“And why not?” demanded Smith, harshly.\n\n“Because she did not like any of the pieces.”\n\n“Wouldn't she have ordered a dress pattern if you had not told her the\ncalico would not wash?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I suppose so,” said Paul, preparing for a storm.\n\n“Then why did you tell her?” demanded his employer, angrily.\n\n“Because she asked me.”\n\n“Couldn't you have told her that it would wash?”\n\n“That would not have been the truth,” said Paul, sturdily.\n\n“You're a mighty conscientious young man,” sneered Smith, “You're\naltogether too pious to succeed in business. I discharge you from my\nemployment.”\n\n“Very well, sir,” said Paul, his heart sinking, but keeping up a brave\nexterior, “then I have only to bid you good-morning.”\n\n“Good-morning, sir,” said his employer with mock deference, “I advise\nyou to study for the ministry, and no longer waste your talents in\nselling calico.”\n\nPaul made no reply, but putting on his cap walked out of the store. It\nwas the middle of the week, and Mr. Smith was, of course, owing him a\nsmall sum for his services; but Paul was too proud to ask for his money,\nwhich that gentleman did not see fit to volunteer.\n\n“I am sure I have done right,” thought Paul. “I had no right to\nmisrepresent the goods to that lady. I wonder what Uncle Hugh will say.”\n\n“You did perfectly right,” said the sexton, after Paul had related the\ncircumstances of his dismissal. “I wouldn't have had you act differently\nfor twenty situations. I have no doubt you will get a better position\nelsewhere.”\n\n“I hope so,” said Paul. “Now that I have lost the situation, Uncle Hugh,\nI don't mind saying that I never liked it.”\n\nNow commenced a search for another place. Day after day Paul went out,\nand day after day he returned with the same want of success.\n\n“Never mind, Paul,” said the sexton encouragingly. “When you do succeed,\nperhaps you'll get something worth waiting for.”\n\nOne morning Paul went out feeling that something was going to\nhappen,--he didn't exactly know what,--but he felt somehow that there\nwas to be a change in his luck. He went out, therefore, with more\nhopefulness than usual; yet, when four o'clock came, and nothing had\noccurred except failure and disappointment, which unhappily were not\nat all out of the ordinary course, Paul began to think that he was very\nfoolish to have expected anything.\n\nHe was walking listlessly along a narrow street, when, on a sudden, he\nheard an exclamation of terror, of which, on turning round, he easily\ndiscovered the cause.\n\nTwo spirited horses, attached to an elegant carriage, had been terrified\nin some way, and were now running at the top of their speed.\n\nThere was no coachman on the box; he had dismounted in order to ring\nat some door, when the horses started. He was now doing his best to\novertake the horses, but in a race between man and horse, it is easy to\npredict which will have the advantage.\n\nThere seemed to be but one person in the carriage. It was a lady,--whose\nface, pale with terror, could be seen from the carriage window. Her\nloud cries of alarm no doubt terrified the horses still more, and, by\naccelerating their speed, tended to make matters worse.\n\nPaul was roused from a train of despondent reflections by seeing the\nhorses coming up the street. He instantly comprehended the whole danger\nof the lady's situation.\n\nMost boys would have thought of nothing but getting out of the way, and\nleaving the carriage and its inmate to their fate. What, indeed, could a\nboy do against a pair of powerful horses, almost beside themselves with\nfright?\n\nBut our hero, as we have already had occasion to see, was brave and\nself-possessed, and felt an instant desire to rescue the lady, whose\nglance of helpless terror, as she leaned her head from the window, he\ncould see. Naturally quickwitted, it flashed upon him that the only way\nto relieve a horse from one terror, was to bring another to bear upon\nhim.\n\nWith scarcely a moment's premeditation, he rushed out into the middle of\nthe street, full in the path of the furious horses, and with his cheeks\npale, for he knew his danger, but with determined air, he waved his arms\naloft, and cried “Whoa!” at the top of his voice.\n\nThe horses saw the sudden movement. They saw the boy standing directly\nin front of them. They heard the word of command to which they had been\nused, and by a sudden impulse, relieved from the blind terror which had\nurged them on, they stopped suddenly, and stood still in the middle of\nthe street, still showing in their quivering limbs the agitation through\nwhich they had passed.\n\nJust then the coachman, panting with his hurried running, came up and\nseized them by the head.\n\n“Youngster,” said he, “you're a brave fellow. You've done us a good\nservice to-day. You're a pretty cool hand, you are. I don't know what\nthese foolish horses would have done with the carriage if it had not\nbeen for you.”\n\n“Let me get out,” exclaimed the lady, not yet recovered from her fright.\n\n“I will open the door,” said Paul, observing that the coachman was fully\noccupied in soothing the horses.\n\nHe sprang forward, and opening the door of the carriage assisted the\nlady to descend.\n\nShe breathed quickly.\n\n“I have been very much frightened,” she said; “and I believe I have been\nin very great danger. Are you the brave boy who stopped the horses?”\n\nPaul modestly answered in the affirmative.\n\n“And how did you do it? I was so terrified that I was hardly conscious\nof what was passing, till the horses stopped.”\n\nPaul modestly related his agency in the matter.\n\nThe lady gazed at his flushed face admiringly.\n\n“How could you have so much courage?” she asked. “You might have been\ntrampled to death under the hoofs of the horses.”\n\n“I didn't think of that. I only thought of stopping the horses.”\n\n“You are a brave boy. I shudder when I think of your danger and mine. I\nshall not dare to get into the carriage again this afternoon.”\n\n“Allow me to accompany you home?” said Paul, politely.\n\n“Thank you; I will trouble you to go with me as far as Broadway, and\nthen I can get into an omnibus.”\n\nShe turned and addressed some words to the coachman, directing him to\ndrive home as soon as the horses were quieted, adding that she would\ntrust herself to the escort of the young hero, who had rescued her from\nthe late peril.\n\n“You're a lucky boy,” thought John, the coachman. “My mistress is one\nthat never does anything by halves. It won't be for nothing that you\nhave rescued her this afternoon.”\n\nAs they walked along, the lady, by delicate questioning, succeeded in\ndrawing from our hero his hopes and wishes for the future. Paul, who\nwas of a frank and open nature, found it very natural to tell her all he\nfelt and wished.\n\n“He seems a remarkably fine boy,” thought the lady to herself. “I should\nlike to do something for him.”\n\nThey emerged into Broadway.\n\n“I will detain you a little longer,” said the lady; “and perhaps trouble\nyou with a parcel.”\n\n“I shall be very glad to take it,” said Paul politely.\n\nAppleton's bookstore was close at hand. Into this the lady went,\nfollowed by her young companion.\n\nA clerk advanced, and inquired her wishes.\n\n“Will you show me some writing-desks?”\n\n“I am going to purchase a writing-desk for a young friend of mine,” she\nexplained to Paul; “as he is a boy, like yourself, perhaps you can guide\nme in the selection.”\n\n“Certainly,” said Paul, unsuspiciously.\n\nSeveral desks were shown. Paul expressed himself admiringly of one made\nof rosewood inlaid with pearl.\n\n“I think I will take it,” said the lady.\n\nThe price was paid, and the desk was wrapped up.\n\n“Now,” said Mrs. Danforth, for this proved to be her name, “I will\ntrouble you, Paul, to take the desk for me, and accompany me in the\nomnibus, that is, if you have no other occupation for your time.”\n\n“I am quite at leisure,” said Paul. “I shall be most happy to do so.”\n\nPaul left the lady at the door of her residence in Fifth Avenue, and\npromised to call on his new friend the next day.\n\nHe went home feeling that, though he had met with no success in\nobtaining a place, he had been very fortunate in rendering so important\na service to a lady whose friendship might be of essential service to\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\nPAUL CALLS ON MRS. DANFORTH.\n\n\n“Mrs. Edward Danforth,” repeated the sexton, on hearing the story of\nPaul's exploit.\n\n“Why, she attends our church.”\n\n“Do you know Mr. Danforth?” asked Paul, with interest.\n\n“Only by sight. I know him by reputation, however.”\n\n“I suppose he is very rich.”\n\n“Yes, I should judge so. At any rate, he is doing an extensive\nbusiness.”\n\n“What is his business?”\n\n“He is a merchant.”\n\n“A merchant,” thought Paul; “that is just what I should like to be, but\nI don't see much prospect of it.”\n\n“How do you like Mrs. Danforth?” inquired the sexton.\n\n“Very much,” said Paul, warmly. “She was very kind, and made me feel\nquite at home in her company.”\n\n“I hope she may be disposed to assist you. She can easily do so, in her\nposition.”\n\nThe next day Paul did not as usual go out in search of a situation.\nHis mind was occupied with thoughts of his coming interview with Mrs.\nDanforth, and he thought he would defer his business plans till the\nsucceeding day.\n\nAt an early hour in the evening, he paused before an imposing residence\non Fifth Avenue, which he had seen but not entered the day previous.\n\nHe mounted the steps and pulled the bell.\n\nA smart-looking man-servant answered his ring.\n\n“Is Mrs. Danforth at home?” asked Paul.\n\n“Yes, I believe so.”\n\n“I have called to see her.”\n\n“Does she expect you?” asked the servant, looking surprised.\n\n“Yes; I come at her appointment,” said Paul.\n\n“Then I suppose it's all right,” said the man. “Will you come in?” he\nasked, a little doubtfully.\n\nPaul followed him into the house, and was shown into the drawing-room,\nthe magnificence of which somewhat dazzled his eyes; accustomed only to\nthe plain sitting-room of Mr. Cameron.\n\nThe servant reappeared after a brief absence, and with rather more\npoliteness than he had before shown, invited Paul to follow him to a\nprivate sitting-room upstairs, where he would see Mrs. Danforth.\n\nLooking at Paul's plain, though neat clothes, the servant was a little\npuzzled to understand what had obtained for Paul the honor of being on\nvisiting terms with Mrs. Danforth.\n\n“Good evening, Paul,” said Mrs. Danforth, rising from her seat and\nwelcoming our hero with extended hand. “So you did not forget your\nappointment.”\n\n“There was no fear of that,” said Paul, with his usual frankness. “I\nhave been looking forward to coming all day.”\n\n“Have you, indeed?” said the lady with a pleasant smile.\n\n“Then I must endeavor to make your visit agreeable to you. Do you\nrecognize this desk?”\n\nUpon a table close by, was the desk which had been purchased the day\nprevious, at Appleton's.\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, “it is the one you bought yesterday. I think it is\nvery handsome.”\n\n“I am glad you think so. I think I told you that I intended it for a\npresent. I have had the new owner's name engraved upon it.”\n\nPaul read the name upon the plate provided for the purpose. His face\nflushed with surprise and pleasure. That name was his own.\n\n“Do you really mean it for me,” he asked.\n\n“If you will accept it,” said Mrs. Danforth, smiling.\n\n“I shall value it very much,” said Paul, gratefully. “And I feel very\nmuch indebted to your kindness.”\n\n“We won't talk of indebtedness, for you remember mine is much the\ngreater. If you will open the desk you will find that it is furnished\nwith what will, I hope, prove of use to you.”\n\nThe desk being opened, proved to contain a liberal supply of stationery,\nsealing wax, postage stamps, and pens.\n\nPaul was delighted with his new present, and Mrs. Danforth seemed to\nenjoy the evident gratification with which it inspired him.\n\n“Now,” said she, “tell me a little about yourself. Have you always lived\nin New York?”\n\n“Only about three years,” said Paul.\n\n“And where did you live before?”\n\n“At Wrenville, in Connecticut.”\n\n“I have heard of the place. A small country town, is it not?”\n\nPaul answered in the affirmative.\n\n“How did you happen to leave Wrenville, and come to New York?”\n\nPaul blushed, and hesitated a moment.\n\n“I ran away,” he said at length, determined to keep nothing back.\n\n“Ran away! Not from home, I hope.”\n\n“I had no home,” said Paul, soberly. “I should never have left there, if\nmy father had not died. Then I was thrown upon the world. I was sent\nto the Poorhouse. I did not want to go, for I thought I could support\nmyself.”\n\n“That is a very honorable feeling. I suppose you did not fare very well\nat the Poorhouse.”\n\nIn reply, Paul detailed some of the grievances to which he had been\nsubjected. Mrs. Danforth listened with sympathizing attention.\n\n“You were entirely justified in running away,” she said, as he\nconcluded. “I can hardly imagine so great a lack of humanity as these\npeople showed. You are now, I hope, pleasantly situated?”\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, “Mr. and Mrs. Cameron treat me with as great kindness\nas if I were their own child.”\n\n“Cameron! Is not that the name of the sexton of our church?” said Mrs.\nDanforth, meditatively.\n\n“It is with him that I have a pleasant home.”\n\n“Indeed, I am glad to hear it. You have been attending school, I\nsuppose.”\n\n“Yes, it is not more than two months since I left off school.”\n\n“And now I suppose you are thinking of entering upon some business.”\n\n“Yes; I have been trying to obtain a place in some merchant's\ncounting-room.”\n\n“You think, then, that you would like the career of a merchant?”\n\n“There is nothing that would suit me better.”\n\n“You have not succeeded in obtaining a place yet, I suppose?”\n\n“No. They are very difficult to get, and I have no influential friends\nto assist me.”\n\n“I have heard Mr. Danforth say that he experienced equal difficulty when\nhe came to New York, a poor boy.”\n\nPaul looked surprised.\n\n“I see that you are surprised,” said Mrs. Danforth, smiling. “You think,\nperhaps, judging from what you see, that my husband was always rich. But\nhe was the son of a poor farmer, and was obliged to make his own way in\nthe world. By the blessing of God, he has been prospered in business and\nbecome rich. But he often speaks of his early discouragements and small\nbeginnings. I am sorry he is not here this evening. By the way, he left\nword for you to call at his counting-room to-morrow, at eleven o'clock.\nI will give you his address.”\n\nShe handed Paul a card containing the specified number, and soon\nafter he withdrew, bearing with him his handsome gift, and a cordial\ninvitation to repeat his call.\n\nHe looked back at the elegant mansion which he had just left, and could\nnot help feeling surprised that the owner of such a palace, should have\nstarted in life with no greater advantages than himself.\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n\nPaul slept late the next morning. He did not hear the breakfast-bell,\nand when the sexton came up to awaken him he rubbed his eyes with\nsuch an expression of bewilderment that Mr. Cameron could not forbear\nlaughing.\n\n“You must have had queer dreams, Paul,” said he.\n\n“Yes, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, laughing, “I believe I have.”\n\n“When you have collected your wits, which at present seem absent on\na wool-gathering expedition, perhaps you will tell what you have been\ndreaming about.”\n\n“So I will,” said Paul, “and perhaps you can interpret it for me. I\ndreamed that I was back again at Mr. Mudge's, and that he sent me out\ninto the field to dig potatoes. I worked away at the first hill, but\nfound no potatoes. In place of them were several gold pieces. I picked\nthem up in great surprise, and instead of putting them into the basket,\nconcluded to put them in my pocket. But as all the hills turned out\nin the same way I got my pockets full, and had to put the rest in the\nbasket. I was just wondering what they would do for potatoes, when all\nat once a great dog came up and seized me by the arm----”\n\n“And you opened your eyes and saw me,” said the sexton, finishing out\nhis narrative.\n\n“Upon my word, that's very complimentary to me. However, some of our\npotatoes have escaped transformation into gold pieces, but I am afraid\nyou will find them rather cold if you don't get down to breakfast pretty\nquick.”\n\n“All right, Uncle Hugh. I'll be down in a jiffy.”\n\nAbout half-past ten Paul started on his way to Mr. Danforth's\ncounting-room. It was located on Wall Street, as he learned from the\ncard which had been given him by Mrs. Danforth. He felt a little awkward\nin making this call. It seemed as if he were going to receive thanks for\nthe service which he had rendered, and he felt that he had already been\nabundantly repaid. However, he was bound in courtesy to call, since he\ndid so at the request of Mrs. Danforth.\n\nIt was a large stone building, divided up into offices, to which Paul\nhad been directed. Mr. Danforth's office he found after a little search,\nupon the second floor.\n\nHe opened the door with a little embarrassment, and looked about him.\n\nIn one corner was a small room, used as a more private office, the door\nof which was closed. In the larger room the only one whom he saw, was\na boy, apparently about his own age, who was standing at a desk and\nwriting.\n\nThis boy looked around as Paul entered, and he at once recognized in him\nan old acquaintance.\n\n“George Dawkins!” he exclaimed in surprise.\n\nThe latter answered in a careless indifferent tone, not exhibiting any\nvery decided pleasure at meeting his old schoolmate.\n\n“Oh, it's you, Prescott, is it?”\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, “I haven't met you since you left our school.”\n\n“No, I believe we have not met,” said Dawkins, in the same tone as\nbefore.\n\n“How long have you been in this office?” asked our hero.\n\n“I really can't say,” said Dawkins, not looking up.\n\n“You can't say!”\n\n“No, I'm rather forgetful.”\n\nPaul could not help feeling chilled at the indifferent manner in which\nhis advances were met. He had been really glad to see Dawkins, and had\naddressed him with cordiality. He could not conceal from himself that\nDawkins did not seem inclined to respond to it.\n\n“Still,” thought Paul, extenuatingly, “perhaps that is his way.”\n\nAs the conversation began to flag, Paul was reminded of his errand by\nDawkins saying, in a tone which was half a sneer, “Have you any business\nwith Mr. Danforth this morning, or did you merely come in out of\ncuriosity?”\n\n“I have called to see Mr. Danforth,” said Paul.\n\n“He is usually pretty busy in the morning,” said Dawkins.\n\n“He directed me to call in the morning,” said Paul, sturdily.\n\n“Oh, indeed!” said Dawkins, a little surprised. “I wonder,” he thought,\n“what business this fellow can have with Mr. Danforth. Can he be fishing\nfor a place?”\n\n“Mr. Danforth is engaged with a visitor just now,” he at length\ncondescended to say; “if your time is not too valuable to wait, you can\nsee him by-and-by.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Paul, rather nettled, “you are very polite.”\n\nTo this Dawkins made no reply, but resumed his pen, and for the next ten\nminutes seemed entirely oblivious of Paul's presence.\n\nOur hero took up the morning paper, and began, as he had so often done\nbefore, to look over the list of wants, thinking it possible he might\nfind some opening for himself.\n\nAbout ten minutes later the door of the inner office opened, and two\ngentlemen came out. One was a gentleman of fifty, a business friend of\nMr. Danforth's, the other was Mr. Danforth himself.\n\nThe former remarked, on seeing Paul, “Is this your son, Danforth?”\n\n“No,” said the merchant, nodding in a friendly manner to Paul.\n\n“That's a good joke,” thought Dawkins, chuckling to himself; “Mr.\nDanforth must be immensely flattered at having a sexton's adopted son\ntaken for his.”\n\nAfter a final word or two on business matters, and arrangements for\nanother interview, the visitor departed, and Mr. Danforth, now at\nleisure, turned to Paul.\n\n“Now my lad,” he said kindly, “if you will follow me, we shall have a\nchance to talk a little.”\n\nPaul followed the merchant into his office, the door of which was\nclosed, much to the regret of Dawkins, who had a tolerably large share\nof curiosity, and was very anxious to find out what business Paul could\npossibly have with his employer.\n\n“Take that seat, if you please;” said Mr. Danforth, motioning Paul to\nan arm-chair, and sitting down himself, “Mrs. Danforth told me from how\ngreat a peril you rescued her. You are a brave boy.”\n\n“I don't know,” said Paul, modestly, “I didn't think of the danger. If I\nhad, perhaps I should have hesitated.”\n\n“If you had not been brave you would have thought of your own risk. My\nwife and myself are under very great obligations to you.”\n\n“That more than repays me for all I did,” said Paul, in a tone of\nmingled modesty and manliness.\n\n“I like the boy,” thought Mr. Danforth; “he is certainly quite superior\nto the common run.”\n\n“Have you left school?” he inquired, after a pause.\n\n“Yes, sir. Last term closed my school life.”\n\n“Then you have never been in a situation.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Indeed! Before you left school?”\n\n“No, sir, since.”\n\n“You did not like it, then?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Paul.\n\n“And was that the reason of your leaving?”\n\n“No, sir; my employer was not satisfied with me,” said Paul, frankly.\n\n“Indeed! I am surprised to hear this! If you have no objection, will you\ntell me the circumstances?”\n\nPaul related in a straightforward manner the difficulty he had had with\nSmith & Thompson.\n\n“I hope you don't think I did wrong,” he concluded.\n\n“By no means,” said Mr. Danforth, warmly. “Your conduct was entirely\ncreditable. As for Smith, I know of him. He is a sharper. It would have\ndone you no good to remain in his employ.”\n\nPaul was pleased with this commendation. He had thought it possible that\nhis dismissal from his former situation might operate against him with\nthe merchant.\n\n“What are your present plans and wishes?” asked Mr. Danforth, after a\nslight pause.\n\n“I should like to enter a merchant's counting-room,” said Paul, “but as\nsuch places are hard to get, I think I shall try to get into a store.”\n\nMr. Danforth reflected a moment, then placing a piece of paper before\nour hero, he said, “Will you write your name and address on this piece\nof paper, that I may know where to find you, in case I hear of a place?”\n\nPaul did as directed. He had an excellent handwriting, a point on which\nthe merchant set a high value.\n\nThe latter surveyed the address with approval, and said, “I am glad you\nwrite so excellent a hand. It will be of material assistance to you in\nsecuring a place in a counting-room. Indeed, it has been already, for I\nhave just thought of a place which I can obtain for you.”\n\n“Can you, sir?” said Paul, eagerly.\n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“In my own counting-room,” said Mr. Danforth, smiling.\n\n“I am very much obliged to you,” said Paul, hardly believing his ears.\n\n“I was prepared to give it to you when you came in, in case I found you\nqualified. The superiority of your handwriting decides me. When can you\ncome?”\n\n“To-morrow, if you like, sir.”\n\n“I like your promptness. As it is the middle of the week, however, you\nmay take a vacation till Monday. Your salary will begin to-morrow.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“I will give you five dollars per week at first, and more as your\nservices become more valuable. Will that be satisfactory?”\n\n“I shall feel rich, sir. Mr. Smith only gave me a dollar and a quarter.”\n\n“I hope you will find other differences between me and Mr. Smith,” said\nthe merchant, smiling.\n\nThese preliminaries over, Mr. Danforth opened the door, and glancing\nat Dawkins, said, “Dawkins, I wish you to become acquainted with your\nfellow clerk, Paul Prescott.”\n\nDawkins looked surprised, and anything but gratified as he responded\nstiffly, “I have the honor of being already acquainted with Mr.\nPrescott.”\n\n“He is a little jealous of an interloper,” thought Mr. Danforth,\nnoticing the repellent manner of young Dawkins. “Never mind, they will\nget acquainted after awhile.”\n\nWhen George Dawkins went home to dinner, his father observed the\ndissatisfied look he wore.\n\n“Is anything amiss, my son?” he inquired.\n\n“I should think there was,” grumbled his son.\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“We've got a new clerk, and who do you think it is?”\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“The adopted son of old Cameron, the sexton.”\n\n“Indeed,” said Mrs. Dawkins. “I really wonder at Mr. Danforth's bad\ntaste. There are many boys of genteel family, who would have been glad\nof the chance. This boy is a low fellow of course.”\n\n“Certainly,” said her son, though he was quite aware that this was not\ntrue.\n\n“What could have brought the boy to Danforth's notice?” asked Dawkins,\nsenior.\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure. The boy has managed to get round him in some\nway. He is very artful.”\n\n“I really think, husband, that you ought to remonstrate with Mr.\nDanforth about taking such a low fellow into his counting-room with our\nGeorge.”\n\n“Pooh!” said Mr. Dawkins, who was a shade more sensible than his wife,\n“he'd think me a meddler.”\n\n“At any rate, George,” pursued his mother, “there's one thing that is\ndue to your family and bringing up,--not to associate with this low\nfellow any more than business requires.”\n\n“I certainly shall not,” said George, promptly.\n\nHe was the worthy son of such a mother.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\nA VULGAR RELATION.\n\n\nAt the end of the first week, Paul received five dollars, the sum which\nthe merchant had agreed to pay him for his services. With this he felt\nvery rich. He hurried home, and displayed to the sexton the crisp bank\nnote which had been given him.\n\n“You will soon be a rich man, Paul,” said Mr. Cameron, with a benevolent\nsmile, returning the bill.\n\n“But I want you to keep it, Uncle Hugh.”\n\n“Shall I put it in the Savings Bank, for you, Paul?”\n\n“I didn't mean that. You have been supporting me--giving me board and\nclothes--for three years. It is only right that you should have what I\nearn.”\n\n“The offer is an honorable one on your part, Paul,” said the sexton;\n“but I don't need it. If it will please you, I will take two dollars\na week for your board, now, and out of the balance you may clothe\nyourself, and save what you can.”\n\nThis arrangement seemed to be a fair one. Mr. Cameron deposited the five\ndollar note in his pocket-book, and passed one of three dollars to Paul.\nThis sum our hero deposited the next Monday morning, in a savings bank.\nHe estimated that he could clothe himself comfortably for fifty dollars\na year. This would leave him one hundred towards the payment of the debt\ndue to Squire Conant.\n\n“By-and-by my salary will be raised,” thought Paul. “Then I can save\nmore.”\n\nHe looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when he should be\nable to redeem his father's name, and no one would be entitled to cast\nreproach upon his memory.\n\nHe endeavored to perform his duties faithfully in the office, and to\nlearn as rapidly as he could the business upon which he had entered.\nHe soon found that he must depend mainly upon himself. George Dawkins\nseemed disposed to afford him no assistance, but repelled scornfully\nthe advances which Paul made towards cordiality. He was by no means as\nfaithful as Paul, but whenever Mr. Danforth was absent from the office,\nspent his time in lounging at the window, or reading a cheap novel, with\none of which he was usually provided.\n\nWhen Paul became satisfied that Dawkins was not inclined to accept his\novertures, he ceased to court his acquaintance, and confined himself to\nhis own desk.\n\nOne day as he was returning from dinner, he was startled by an\nunceremonious slap upon the shoulder.\n\nLooking up in some surprise, he found that this greeting had come from a\nman just behind him, whose good-humored face and small, twinkling eyes,\nhe at once recognized.\n\n“How do you do, Mr. Stubbs?” inquired Paul, his face lighting up with\npleasure.\n\n“I'm so's to be round. How be you?” returned the worthy pedler, seizing\nour hero's hand and shaking it heartily.\n\nMr. Stubbs was attired in all the glory of a blue coat with brass\nbuttons and swallow tails.\n\n“When did you come to New York?” asked Paul.\n\n“Just arrived; that is, I got in this mornin'. But I say, how you've\ngrown. I shouldn't hardly have known you.”\n\n“Shouldn't you, though?” said Paul, gratified as most boys are, on being\ntold that he had grown. “Have you come to the city on business?”\n\n“Well, kinder on business, and kinder not. I thought I'd like to have a\nvacation. Besides, the old lady wanted a silk dress, and she was sot on\nhavin' it bought in York. So I come to the city.”\n\n“Where are you stopping, Mr. Stubbs?”\n\n“Over to the Astor House. Pretty big hotel, ain't it?”\n\n“Yes, I see you are traveling in style.”\n\n“Yes, I suppose they charge considerable, but I guess I can stand it. I\nhain't been drivin' a tin-cart for nothin' the last ten years.\n\n“How have you been enjoying yourself since you arrived?”\n\n“Oh, pretty well. I've been round seeing the lions, and came pretty near\nseeing the elephant at one of them Peter Funk places.”\n\n“You did! Tell me about it.”\n\n“You see I was walkin' along when a fellow came out of one of them\nplaces, and asked me if I wouldn't go in. I didn't want to refuse such\na polite invitation, and besides I had a curiosity to see what there was\nto be seen, so I went in. They put up a silver watch, I could see that\nit was a good one, and so I bid on it. It ran up to eight dollars and\na quarter. I thought it was a pity it should go off so cheap, so I bid\neight and a half.”\n\n“'Eight and a half and sold,' said the man; 'shall I put it up for you?”\n\n“'No, I thank you,' said I, 'I'll take it as it is.'\n\n“'But I'll put it up in a nice box for you,' said he.\n\n“I told him I didn't care for the box. He seemed very unwilling to let\nit go, but I took it out of his hand and he couldn't help himself. Well,\nwhen they made out the bill, what do you suppose they charged?”\n\n“I don't know.”\n\n“Why, eighteen and a half.”\n\n“'Look here,' said I, 'I guess here's something of a mistake. You've got\nten dollars too much.'\n\n“'I think you must be mistaken,' said he, smiling a foxy smile.\n\n“'You know I am not,' said I, rather cross.\n\n“We can't let that watch go for any thing shorter,' said he, coolly.\n\n“Just then a man that was present stepped up and said, 'the man is\nright; don't attempt to impose upon him.'\n\n“With that he calmed right down. It seems it was a policeman who was\nsent to watch them, that spoke. So I paid the money, but as I went out\nI heard the auctioneer say that the sale was closed for the day. I\nafterwards learned that if I had allowed them to put the watch in a box,\nthey would have exchanged it for another that was only plated.”\n\n“Do you know anybody in the city?” asked Paul.\n\n“I've got some relations, but I don't know where they live.”\n\n“What is the name?” asked Paul, “we can look into the directory.”\n\n“The name is Dawkins,” answered the pedler.\n\n“Dawkins!” repeated Paul, in surprise.\n\n“Yes, do you happen to know anybody of the name?”\n\n“Yes, but I believe it is a rich family.”\n\n“Well, so are my relations,” said Jehoshaphat. “You didn't think\nJehoshaphat Stubbs had any rich relations, did you? These, as I've heard\ntell, hold their heads as high as anybody.”\n\n“Perhaps I may be mistaken,” said Paul.\n\n“What is the name--the Christian name, I mean--of your relation?”\n\n“George.”\n\n“It must be he, then. There is a boy of about my own age of that name.\nHe works in the same office.”\n\n“You don't say so! Well, that is curious, I declare. To think that I\nshould have happened to hit upon you so by accident too.”\n\n“How are you related to them?” inquired Paul.\n\n“Why, you see, I'm own cousin to Mr. Dawkins. His father and my mother\nwere brother and sister.”\n\n“What was his father's business?” asked Paul.\n\n“I don't know what his regular business was, but he was a sexton in some\nchurch.”\n\nThis tallied with the account Paul had received from Mr. Cameron, and\nhe could no longer doubt that, strange as it seemed, the wealthy Mr.\nDawkins was own cousin to the pedler.\n\n“Didn't you say the boy was in the same office with you, Paul?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, I've a great mind to go and see him, and find out where his\nfather lives. Perhaps I may get an invite to his house.”\n\n“How shocked Dawkins will be!” thought Paul, not, it must be confessed,\nwithout a feeling of amusement. He felt no compunction in being the\ninstrument of mortifying the false pride of his fellow clerk, and\nhe accordingly signified to Mr. Stubbs that he was on his way to the\ncounting-room.\n\n“Are you, though? Well, I guess I'll go along with you. Is it far off?”\n\n“Only in the next street.”\n\nThe pedler, it must be acknowledged, had a thoroughly countrified\nappearance. He was a genuine specimen of the Yankee,--a long, gaunt\nfigure, somewhat stooping, and with a long aquiline nose. His dress has\nalready been described.\n\nAs Dawkins beheld him entering with Paul, he turned up his nose in\ndisgust at what he considered Paul's friend.\n\nWhat was his consternation when the visitor, approaching him with\na benignant smile, extended his brown hand, and said, “How d'ye do,\nGeorge? How are ye all to hum?”\n\nDawkins drew back haughtily.\n\n“What do you mean?” he said, pale with passion.\n\n“Mr. Dawkins,” said Paul, with suppressed merriment, “allow me to\nintroduce your cousin, Mr. Stubbs.”\n\n“Jehoshaphat Stubbs,” explained that individual. “Didn't your father\nnever mention my name to you?”\n\n“Sir,” said Dawkins, darting a furious glance at Paul, “you are entirely\nmistaken if you suppose that any relationship exists between me and\nthat--person.”\n\n“No, it's you that are mistaken,” said Mr. Stubbs, persevering, “My\nmother was Roxana Jane Dawkins. She was own sister to your grandfather.\nThat makes me and your father cousins Don't you see?”\n\n“I see that you are intending to insult me,” said Dawkins, the more\nfuriously, because he began to fear there might be some truth in the\nman's claims. “Mr. Prescott, I leave you to entertain your company\nyourself.”\n\nAnd he threw on his hat and dashed out of the counting-room.\n\n“Well,” said the pedler, drawing a long breath, “that's cool,--denyin'\nhis own flesh and blood. Rather stuck up, ain't he?”\n\n“He is, somewhat,” said Paul; “if I were you, I shouldn't be disposed to\nown him as a relation.”\n\n“Darned ef I will!” said Jehoshaphat sturdily; “I have some pride, ef I\nam a pedler. Guess I'm as good as he, any day.”\n\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\nMR. MUDGE'S FRIGHT.\n\n\nSquire Newcome sat in a high-backed chair before the fire with his heels\non the fender. He was engaged in solemnly perusing the leading editorial\nin the evening paper, when all at once the table at his side gave a\nsudden lurch, the lamp slid into his lap, setting the paper on fire,\nand, before the Squire realized his situation, the flames singed his\nwhiskers, and made his face unpleasantly warm.\n\n“Cre-a-tion!” he exclaimed, jumping briskly to his feet.\n\nThe lamp had gone out, so that the cause of the accident remained\ninvolved in mystery. The Squire had little trouble in conjecturing,\nhowever, that Ben was at the bottom of it.\n\nOpening the door hastily, he saw, by the light in the next room, that\nyoung gentleman rising from his knees in the immediate vicinity of the\ntable.\n\n“Ben-ja-min,” said the Squire, sternly,\n\n“What have you been a-doing?”\n\nBen looked sheepish, but said nothing.\n\n“I repeat, Benjamin, what have you been a-doing?”\n\n“I didn't mean to,” said Ben.\n\n“That does not answer my interrogatory. What have you been a-doing?”\n\n“I was chasing the cat,” said Ben, “and she got under the table. I\nwent after her, and somehow it upset. Guess my head might have knocked\nagainst the legs.”\n\n“How old are you, Benjamin?”\n\n“Fifteen.”\n\n“A boy of fifteen is too old to play with cats. You may retire to your\ndormitory.”\n\n“It's only seven o'clock, father,” said Ben, in dismay.\n\n“Boys that play with cats are young enough to retire at seven,” remarked\nthe Squire, sagaciously.\n\nThere was nothing for Ben but to obey.\n\nAccordingly with reluctant steps he went up to his chamber and went\nto bed. His active mind, together with the early hour, prevented his\nsleeping. Instead, his fertile imagination was employed in devising\nsome new scheme, in which, of course, fun was to be the object attained.\nWhile he was thinking, one scheme flashed upon him which he at once\npronounced “bully.”\n\n“I wish I could do it to-night,” he sighed.\n\n“Why can't I?” he thought, after a moment's reflection.\n\nThe more he thought of it, the more feasible it seemed, and at length he\ndecided to attempt it.\n\nRising from his bed he quickly dressed himself, and then carefully took\nthe sheet, and folding it up in small compass put it under his arm.\n\nNext, opening the window, he stepped out upon the sloping roof of the\nell part, and slid down to the end where he jumped off, the height not\nbeing more than four feet from the ground. By some accident, a tub of\nsuds was standing under the eaves, and Ben, much to his disgust, jumped\ninto it.\n\n“Whew!” exclaimed he, “I've jumped into that plaguy tub. What possessed\nHannah to put it in a fellow's way?”\n\nAt this moment the back door opened, and Hannah called out, in a shrill\nvoice, “Who's there?” Ben hastily hid himself, and thought it best not\nto answer.\n\n“I guess 'twas the cat,” said Hannah, as she closed the door.\n\n“A two-legged cat,” thought Ben, to himself; “thunder, what sopping wet\nfeet I've got. Well, it can't be helped.”\n\nWith the sheet still under his arm, Ben climbed a fence and running\nacross the fields reached the fork of the road. Here he concealed\nhimself under a hedge, and waited silently till the opportunity for\nplaying his practical joke arrived.\n\nI regret to say that Mr. Mudge, with whom we have already had\nconsiderable to do, was not a member of the temperance society.\nLatterly, influenced perhaps by Mrs. Mudge's tongue, which made his home\nfar from a happy one, he had got into the habit of spending his\nevenings at the tavern in the village, where he occasionally indulged\nin potations that were not good for him. Generally, he kept within the\nbounds of moderation, but occasionally he exceeded these, as he had done\non the present occasion.\n\nSome fifteen minutes after Ben had taken his station, he saw, in the\nmoonlight, Mr. Mudge coming up the road, on his way home. Judging from\nhis zigzag course, he was not quite himself.\n\nBen waited till Mr. Mudge was close at hand, when all at once he started\nfrom his place of concealment completely enveloped in the sheet with\nwhich he was provided. He stood motionless before the astounded Mudge.\n\n“Who are you?” exclaimed Mudge, his knees knocking together in terror,\nclinging to an overhanging branch for support.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Who are you?” he again asked in affright.\n\n“Sally Baker,” returned Ben, in as sepulchral a voice as he could\ncommand.\n\nSally Baker was an old pauper, who had recently died. The name occurred\nto Ben on the spur of the moment. It was with some difficulty that he\nsucceeded in getting out the name, such was his amusement at Mr. Mudge's\nevident terror.\n\n“What do you want of me?” inquired Mudge, nervously.\n\n“You half starved me when I was alive,” returned Ben, in a hollow voice,\n“I must be revenged.”\n\nSo saying he took one step forward, spreading out his arms. This was too\nmuch for Mr. Mudge. With a cry he started and ran towards home at the\ntop of his speed, with Ben in pursuit.\n\n“I believe I shall die of laughing,” exclaimed Ben, pausing out of\nbreath, and sitting down on a stone, “what a donkey he is, to be sure,\nto think there are such things as ghosts. I'd like to be by when he\ntells Mrs. Mudge.”\n\nAfter a moment's thought, Ben wrapped up the sheet, took it under his\narm, and once more ran in pursuit of Mr. Mudge.\n\nMeanwhile Mrs. Mudge was sitting in the kitchen of the Poorhouse,\nmending stockings. She was not in the pleasantest humor, for one of the\npaupers had managed to break a plate at tea-table (if that can be called\ntea where no tea is provided), and trifles were sufficient to ruffle\nMrs. Mudge's temper.\n\n“Where's Mudge, I wonder?” she said, sharply; “over to the tavern, I\ns'pose, as usual. There never was such a shiftless, good-for-nothing\nman. I'd better have stayed unmarried all the days of my life than have\nmarried him. If he don't get in by ten, I'll lock the door, and it shall\nstay locked. 'Twill serve him right to stay out doors all night.”\n\nMinutes slipped away, and the decisive hour approached.\n\n“I'll go to the door and look out,” thought Mrs. Mudge, “if he ain't\nanywhere in sight I'll fasten the door.”\n\nShe laid down her work and went to the door.\n\nShe had not quite reached it when it was flung open violently, and Mr.\nMudge, with a wild, disordered look, rushed in, nearly overturning his\nwife, who gazed at him with mingled anger and astonishment.\n\n“What do you mean by this foolery, Mudge?” she demanded, sternly.\n\n“What do I mean?” repeated her husband, vaguely.\n\n“I needn't ask you,” said his wife, contemptuously. “I see how it is,\nwell enough. You're drunk!”\n\n“Drunk!”\n\n“Yes, drunk; as drunk as a beast.”\n\n“Well, Mrs. Mudge,” hiccoughed her husband, in what he endeavored to\nmake a dignified tone, “you'd be drunk too if you'd seen what I've\nseen.”\n\n“And what have you seen, I should like to know?” said Mrs. Mudge.\n\nMudge rose with some difficulty, steadied himself on his feet, and\napproaching his wife, whispered in a tragic tone, “Mrs. Mudge, I've seen\na sperrit.”\n\n“It's plain enough that you've seen spirit,” retorted his wife. “'Tisn't\nmany nights that you don't, for that matter. You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself, Mudge.”\n\n“It isn't that,” said her husband, shaking his hand, “it's a sperrit,--a\nghost, that I've seen.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Mrs. Mudge, sarcastically, “perhaps you can tell whose it\nis.”\n\n“It was the sperrit of Sally Baker,” said Mudge, solemnly.\n\n“What did she say?” demanded Mrs. Mudge, a little curiously.\n\n“She said that I--that we, half starved her, and then she started to run\nafter me--and--oh, Lordy, there she is now!”\n\nMudge jumped trembling to his feet. Following the direction of his\noutstretched finger, Mrs. Mudge caught a glimpse of a white figure\njust before the window. I need hardly say that it was Ben, who had just\narrived upon the scene.\n\nMrs. Mudge was at first stupefied by what she saw, but being a woman\nof courage she speedily recovered herself, and seizing the broom\nfrom behind the door, darted out in search of the “spirit.” But Ben,\nperceiving that he was discovered, had disappeared, and there was\nnothing to be seen.\n\n“Didn't I tell you so?” muttered Mudge, as his wife re-entered, baffled\nin her attempt, “you'll believe it's a sperrit, now.”\n\n“Go to bed, you fool!” retorted his wife.\n\nThis was all that passed between Mr. and Mrs. Mudge on the subject. Mr.\nMudge firmly believes, to this day, that the figure which appeared to\nhim was the spirit of Sally Baker.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\nHOW BEN GOT HOME.\n\n\nDelighted with the complete success of his practical joke, Ben took his\nway homeward with the sheet under his arm. By the time he reached his\nfather's house it was ten o'clock. The question for Ben to consider now\nwas, how to get in. If his father had not fastened the front door he\nmight steal in, and slip up stairs on tiptoe without being heard.\nThis would be the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty, and Ben,\nperceiving that the light was still burning in the sitting-room, had\nsome hopes that he would be able to adopt it. But while he was only\na couple of rods distant he saw the lamp taken up by his father, who\nappeared to be moving from the room.\n\n“He's going to lock the front door,” thought Ben, in disappointment; “if\nI had only got along five minutes sooner.”\n\nFrom his post outside he heard the key turn in the lock.\n\nThe 'Squire little dreamed that the son whom he imagined fast asleep in\nhis room was just outside the door he was locking.\n\n“I guess I'll go round to the back part of the house,” thought Ben,\n“perhaps I can get in the same way I came out.”\n\nAccordingly he went round and managed to clamber upon the roof, which\nwas only four feet from the ground. But a brief trial served to convince\nour young adventurer that it is a good deal easier sliding down a roof\nthan it is climbing up. The shingles being old were slippery, and though\nthe ascent was not steep, Ben found the progress he made was very much\nlike that of a man at the bottom of a well, who is reported as falling\nback two feet for every three that he ascended. What increased the\ndifficulty of his attempt was that the soles of his shoes were well\nworn, and slippery as well as the shingles.\n\n“I never can get up this way,” Ben concluded, after several fruitless\nattempts; “I know what I'll do,” he decided, after a moment's\nperplexity; “I'll pull off my shoes and stockings, and then I guess I\ncan get along better.”\n\nBen accordingly got down from the roof, and pulled off his shoes and\nstockings. As he wanted to carry these with him, he was at first\na little puzzled by this new difficulty. He finally tied the shoes\ntogether by the strings and hung them round his neck. He disposed of the\nstockings by stuffing one in each pocket.\n\n“Now,” thought Ben, “I guess I can get along better. I don't know what\nto do with the plaguy sheet, though.”\n\nBut necessity is the mother of invention, and Ben found that he could\nthrow the sheet over his shoulders, as a lady does with her shawl. Thus\naccoutered he recommenced the ascent with considerable confidence.\n\nHe found that his bare feet clung to the roof more tenaciously than\nthe shoes had done, and success was already within his grasp, when an\nunforeseen mishap frustrated his plans. He had accomplished about three\nquarters of the ascent when all at once the string which united the\nshoes which he had hung round his neck gave way, and both fell with a\ngreat thump on the roof. Ben made a clutch for them in which he lost his\nown hold, and made a hurried descent in their company, alighting with\nhis bare feet on some flinty gravel stones, which he found by no means\nagreeable.\n\n“Ow!” ejaculated Ben, limping painfully, “them plaguy gravel stones\nhurt like thunder. I'll move 'em away the first thing to-morrow. If that\nconfounded shoe-string hadn't broken I'd have been in bed by this time.”\n\nMeanwhile Hannah had been sitting over the kitchen fire enjoying a\nsocial chat with a “cousin” of hers from Ireland, a young man whom\nshe had never seen or heard of three months before. In what way he had\nsucceeded in convincing her of the relationship I have never been able\nto learn, but he had managed to place himself on familiar visiting terms\nwith the inmate of 'Squire Newcome's kitchen.\n\n“It's only me cousin, sir,” Hannah explained to the 'Squire, when he\nhad questioned her on the subject; “he's just from Ireland, sir, and it\nseems like home to see him.”\n\nOn the present occasion Tim Flaherty had outstayed his usual time, and\nwas still in the kitchen when Ben reached home. They did not at first\nhear him, but when he made his last abortive attempt, and the shoes came\nclattering down, they could not help hearing.\n\n“What's that?” asked Hannah, listening attentively.\n\nShe went to the door to look out, her cousin following.\n\nThere was nothing to be seen.\n\n“Perhaps you was dramin' Hannah,” said Tim, “more by token, it's time we\nwas both doin' that same, so I'll bid you good-night.”\n\n“Come again soon, Tim,” said Hannah, preparing to close the door.\n\nA new plan of entrance flashed upon Ben.\n\nHe quickly put on his shoes and stockings, unfolded the sheet and\nprepared to enact the part of a ghost once more,--this time for the\nspecial benefit of Hannah.\n\nAfter fully attiring himself he came to the back door which Hannah had\nalready locked, and tapped three times.\n\nHannah was engaged in raking out the kitchen fire.\n\n“Sure it's Tim come back,” thought she, as she went to the door.\n“Perhaps he's forgotten something.”\n\nShe opened the door unsuspiciously, fully expecting to see her Irish\ncousin standing before her.\n\nWhat was her terror on beholding a white-robed figure, with extended\narms.\n\n“Howly virgin, defend me!” she exclaimed, in paralyzing terror, which\nwas increased by a guttural sound which proceeded from the throat of\nthe ghost, who at the same time waved his arms aloft, and made a step\ntowards Hannah.\n\nHannah, with a wild howl dropped the lamp and fed towards the\nsitting-room, where 'Squire Newcome was still sitting.\n\nBen sped upstairs at the top of his speed, dashed into his own chamber,\nspread the sheet on the bed, and undressed so rapidly that he seemed\nonly to shake his clothes off, and jumped into bed. He closed his eyes\nand appeared to be in a profound slumber.\n\nHannah's sudden appearance in the sitting-room in such a state naturally\nastonished the 'Squire.\n\n“What's the matter?” he demanded of the affrighted servant.\n\n“Oh, sir,” she gasped, “I'm almost kilt entirely.”\n\n“Are you?” said the 'Squire, “you appear to be more frightened than\nhurt.”\n\n“Yes, sir, shure I am frightened, which indeed I couldn't help it, sir,\nfor I never saw a ghost before in all my life.”\n\n“A ghost! What nonsense are you talking, Hannah?”\n\n“Shure it's not nonsense, for it's just now that the ghost came to the\ndoor, sir, and knocked, and I went to the door thinking it might be me\ncousin, who's been passing the evening with me, when I saw a great white\nghost, ten foot tall, standing forninst me.”\n\n“Ten feet tall?”\n\n“Yes, sir, and he spread out his arms and spoke in a terrible voice, and\nwas going to carry me off wid him, but I dropped the lamp, and O sir,\nI'm kilt entirely.”\n\n“This is a strange story,” said 'Squire Newcome, rather suspiciously; “I\nhope you have not been drinking.”\n\nHannah protested vehemently that not a drop of liquor had passed her\nlips, which was true.\n\n“I'll go out and hunt for the ghost,” said the 'Squire.\n\n“Oh, don't sir. He'll carry you off,” said Hannah, terrified.\n\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the 'Squire. “Follow me, or you may stay here if\nyou are frightened.”\n\nThis Hannah would by no means do, since the 'Squire had taken the lamp\nand she would be left in the dark.\n\nAccordingly she followed him with a trembling step, as he penetrated\nthrough the kitchen into the back room, ready to run at the least alarm.\n\nThe back-door was wide open, but nothing was to be seen of the ghost.\n\n“Perhaps the ghost's up-stairs,” said Hannah, “I can't sleep up there\nthis night, shure.”\n\nBut something had attracted Squire Newcome's attention. It was quite\nmuddy out of doors, and Ben had tracked in considerable mud with him.\nThe footprints were very perceptible on the painted floor.\n\n“The ghost seems to have had muddy shoes,” said the 'Squire dryly; “I\nguess I can find him.”\n\nHe followed the tracks which witnessed so strongly against Ben, to whose\nchamber they led.\n\nBen, though still awake, appeared to be in a profound slumber.\n\n“Ben-ja-min!” said his father, stooping over the bed.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Ben-ja-min!” repeated his father, giving him a shake, “what does all\nthis mean?”\n\n“What?” inquired Ben, opening his eyes, and looking very innocent.\n\n“Where have you been, to-night?”\n\n“You sent me to bed,” said Ben, “and I came.”\n\nBut the 'Squire was not to be deceived. He was already in possession\nof too much information to be put off. So Ben, who with all his love\nof mischief was a boy of truth, finally owned up everything. His father\nsaid very little, but told him the next morning that he had made up his\nmind to send him to a military boarding-school, where the discipline was\nvery strict. Ben hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry, but finally,\nas boys like change and variety, came to look upon his new prospects\nwith considerable cheerfulness.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX.\n\nDAWKINS IN DIFFICULTIES.\n\n\nGeorge Dawkins was standing at his desk one morning, when a man entered\nthe office, and stepping up to him, unceremoniously tapped him on the\nshoulder.\n\nDawkins turned. He looked extremely annoyed on perceiving his visitor,\nwhose outward appearance was certainly far from prepossessing. His face\nexhibited unmistakable marks of dissipation, nor did the huge breast\npin and other cheap finery which he wore conceal the fact of his intense\nvulgarity. His eyes were black and twinkling, his complexion very dark,\nand his air that of a foreigner. He was, in fact, a Frenchman, though\nhis language would hardly have betrayed him, unless, as sometimes, he\nchose to interlard his discourse with French phrases.\n\n“How are you this morning, my friend?” said the newcomer.\n\n“What are you here for?” asked Dawkins, roughly.\n\n“That does not seem to me a very polite way of receiving your friends.”\n\n“Friends!” retorted Dawkins, scornfully, “who authorized you to call\nyourself my friend?”\n\n“Creditor, then, if it will suit you better, mon ami.”\n\n“Hush,” said Dawkins, in an alarmed whisper, “he will hear,” here he\nindicated Paul with his finger.\n\n“And why should I care? I have no secrets from the young man.”\n\n“Stop, Duval,” exclaimed Dawkins, in an angry whisper, “Leave the office\nat once. Your appearing here will injure me.”\n\n“But I am not your friend; why should I care?” sneered Duval.\n\n“Listen to reason. Leave me now, and I will meet you when and where you\nwill.”\n\n“Come, that sounds better.”\n\n“Now go. I'm afraid Mr. Danforth will be in.”\n\n“If he comes, introduce me.”\n\nDawkins would like to have knocked the fellow over.\n\n“Name your place and time, and be quick about it,” said he impatiently.\n\n“Eight o'clock this evening, you know where,” was the answer.\n\n“Very well. Good-morning.”\n\n“Mind you bring some money.”\n\n“Good-morning,” returned Dawkins, angrily.\n\nAt length, much to his relief, Duval left the office. Dawkins stole a\nside glance at Paul, to see what impression the interview had made upon\nhim, but our hero, who had overheard some portions of the dialogue,\nperceiving that Dawkins wished it to be private, took as little notice\nof the visitor as possible. He could not help thinking, however, that\nDuval was a man whose acquaintance was likely to be of little benefit to\nhis fellow clerk.\n\nThroughout the day Dawkins appeared unusually nervous, and made several\nblunders which annoyed Mr. Danforth. Evidently he had something on his\nmind. Not to keep the reader in suspense, George had fallen among bad\ncompanions, where he had learned both to drink and to gamble. In this\nway he had made the acquaintance of Duval, an unscrupulous sharper, who\nhad contrived to get away all his ready money, and persuading him to\nplay longer in the hope of making up his losses had run him into debt\none hundred and fifty dollars. Dawkins gave him an acknowledgment of\nindebtedness to that amount. This of course placed him in Duval's power,\nsince he knew of no means of raising such a sum. He therefore kept out\nof the Frenchman's way, avoiding the old haunts where he would have been\nlikely to meet him. Dawkins supposed Duval ignorant of the whereabouts\nof his employer's counting-room. So he had been, but he made it his\nbusiness to ascertain where it was. He had no idea of losing sight of so\nvaluable a prize.\n\nDawkins would willingly have broken the appointment he had made with\nDuval, but he did not dare to do so. He knew that the man was well\nable to annoy him, and he would not on any account have had the affair\ndisclosed to his father or Mr. Danforth.\n\nAs Trinity clock struck eight, he entered a low bar-room in the\nneighborhood of the docks.\n\nA young man with pale, sandy hair stood behind the counter with his\nsleeves rolled up. He was supplying the wants of a sailor who already\nappeared to have taken more drink than was good for him.\n\n“Good evening, Mr. Dawkins,” said he, “you're a stranger.”\n\n“Is Duval in?” inquired Dawkins, coldly. His pride revolted at the place\nand company. He had never been here but once before, having met Duval\nelsewhere.\n\n“He's up in his room. John show the young gentleman up to No. 9. Won't\nyou have a glass of something this evening?”\n\n“No,” said Dawkins, abruptly.\n\nThe boy preceded him up a dark and dirty staircase.\n\n“That's the room, sir,” he said.\n\n“Stop a minute,” said Dawkins, “he may not be in.”\n\nHe inwardly hoped he might not. But Duval answered his knock by coming\nto the door himself.\n\n“Delighted to see you, mon ami. John, may leave the lamp. That's all,\nunless Mr. Dawkins wishes to order something.”\n\n“I want nothing,” said Dawkins.\n\n“They have some capital brandy.”\n\n“I am not in the mood for drinking tonight.”\n\n“As you please,” said the Frenchman, disappointed; “be seated.”\n\nDawkins sat down in a wooden rocking-chair, minus an arm.\n\n“Well,” said Duval, “how much money have you brought me?”\n\n“None.”\n\nThe Frenchman frowned and stroked his mustache, fiercely.\n\n“What does all this mean? Are you going to put me off longer?”\n\n“I would pay it if I could,” said Dawkins, “but I haven't got the\nmoney.”\n\n“You could get it.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“Ask your father.”\n\n“My father would rave if he knew that I had lost money in such a way.”\n\n“But you need not tell him.”\n\n“If I ask for money, he will be sure to ask what I want it for.”\n\n“Tell him you want clothes, or a watch, or a hundred things.”\n\nDawkins shook his head; “it won't do,” said he. “He wouldn't give me a\nhundred and fifty dollars.”\n\n“Then ask seventy-five, and I will wait a month for the rest.”\n\n“Look here, Duval, you have no rightful claim to this money. You've got\nenough out of me. Just tear up the paper.”\n\nDuval laughed scornfully, “Aha, Mr. Dawkins,” he said, “that would be\na very pretty arrangement FOR YOU. But I don't see how it is going to\nbenefit me. No, no, I can't afford to throw away a hundred and fifty\ndollars so easily. If I was a rich man like your father it would make a\ndifference.”\n\n“Then you won't remit the debt,” said Dawkins, sullenly.\n\n“You would think me a great ninny, if I did.”\n\n“Then you may collect it the best way you can.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?” demanded the Frenchman, his face darkening.\n\n“I mean what I say,” said Dawkins, desperately, “Gambling debts are not\nrecognizable in law.”\n\n“Nothing is said about it's being a gambling debt. I have your note.”\n\n“Which is worth nothing, since I am a minor.”\n\nDuval's face became black with rage.\n\n“Aha, my friend,” said he showing his teeth, “this is a very nice game\nto cheat me out of my money. But it won't do, it won't do.”\n\n“Why won't it?”\n\n“I shall say a word in your father's ear, mon ami, and in the ear of\nyour worthy employer whom you were so anxious for me not to see, and\nperhaps that would be worse for you than to pay me my money.”\n\nDawkins's brief exultation passed away. He saw that he was indeed in the\npower of an unscrupulous man, who was disposed to push his advantage to\nthe utmost.\n\nHe subsided into a moody silence, which Duval watched with satisfaction.\n\n“Well, my friend, what will you do about it?”\n\n“I don't know what I can do.”\n\n“You will think of something. You will find it best,” said the\nFrenchman, in a tone which veiled a threat.\n\n“I will try,” said Dawkins, gloomily.\n\n“That is well. I thought you would listen to reason, mon ami. Now we\nwill have a pleasant chat. Hold, I will order some brandy myself.”\n\n“Not for me,” said Dawkins, rising from his chair, “I must be going.”\n\n“Will you not have one little game?” asked Duval, coaxingly.\n\n“No, no, I have had enough of that. Goodnight.”\n\n“Then you won't stop. And when shall I have the pleasure of seeing you\nat my little apartment once more?”\n\n“I don't know.”\n\n“If it is any trouble to you to come, I will call at your office,” said\nDuval, significantly.\n\n“Don't trouble yourself,” said Dawkins, hastily; “I will come here a\nweek from today.”\n\n“A week is a long time.”\n\n“Long or short, I must have it.”\n\n“Very well, mon ami. A week let it be. Good-night. Mind the stairs as\nyou go down.”\n\nDawkins breathed more freely as he passed out into the open air. He was\nbeginning to realize that the way of the transgressor is hard.\n\n\n\n\nXXX.\n\nA TRAP IS LAID FOR PAUL.\n\n\nThree months before, George Dawkins had made his first visit to a\ngambling house. At first, he had entered only from curiosity. He watched\nthe play with an interest which gradually deepened, until he was easily\npersuaded to try his own luck. The stakes were small, but fortune\nfavored him, and he came out some dollars richer than he entered. It\nwould have been fortunate for him if he had failed. As it was, his\ngood fortune encouraged him to another visit. This time he was less\nfortunate, but his gains about balanced his losses, so that he came out\neven. On the next occasion he left off with empty pockets. So it went on\nuntil at length he fell into the hands of Duval, who had no scruple in\nfleecing him to as great an extent as he could be induced to go.\n\nGeorge Dawkins's reflections were not of the most cheerful character as,\nleaving Duval, he slowly pursued his way homeward. He felt that he had\nfallen into the power of an unscrupulous villain, who would have no\nmercy upon him. He execrated his own folly, without which all the\nmachination of Duval would have been without effect.\n\nThe question now, however, was, to raise the money. He knew of no one\nto whom he could apply except his father, nor did he have much hope from\nthat quarter. Still, he would make the effort.\n\nReaching home he found his father seated in the library. He looked up\nfrom the evening paper as George entered.\n\n“Only half-past nine,” he said, with an air of sarcasm. “You spend your\nevenings out so systematically that your early return surprises me. How\nis it? Has the theater begun to lose its charm!”\n\nThere was no great sympathy between father and son, and if either felt\naffection for the other, it was never manifested. Mutual recrimination\nwas the rule between them, and George would now have made an angry\nanswer but that he had a favor to ask, and felt it politic to be\nconciliatory.\n\n“If I had supposed you cared for my society, sir, I would have remained\nat home oftener.”\n\n“Umph!” was the only reply elicited from his father.\n\n“However, there was a good reason for my not going to the theater\nto-night.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“I had no money.”\n\n“Your explanation is quite satisfactory,” said his father, with a slight\nsneer. “I sympathize in your disappointment.”\n\n“There is no occasion, sir,” said George, good humoredly, for him. “I\nhad no great desire to go.”\n\nDawkins took down a book from the library and tried to read, but\nwithout much success. His thoughts continually recurred to his pecuniary\nembarrassments, and the debt which he owed to Duval seemed to hang like\na millstone around his neck. How should he approach his father on the\nsubject? In his present humor he feared he would have little chance.\n\nAs his father laid down the newspaper Dawkins said, “Wouldn't you like a\ngame of checkers, sir?”\n\nThis, as he well knew, was a favorite game with his father.\n\n“I don't know but I should,” said Mr. Dawkins, more graciously than was\nhis wont.\n\nThe checker-board was brought, and the two commenced playing. Three\ngames were played all of which his father won. This appeared to put\nhim in a good humor, for as the two ceased playing, he drew a\nten-dollar-bill from his pocket-book, and handed to his son, with the\nremark, “There, George, I don't want you to be penniless. You are a\nlittle extravagant, though, I think. Your pay from Mr. Danforth ought to\nkeep you in spending money.”\n\n“Yes, sir, I have been rather extravagant, but I am going to reform.”\n\n“I am very glad to hear it.”\n\n“I wish, sir,” said George a moment afterwards, “that you would allow me\nto buy my own clothes.”\n\n“I've no sort of an objection, I am sure. You select them now, don't\nyou?”\n\n“Yes, sir, but I mean to suggest that you should make me an allowance\nfor that purpose,--about as much as it costs now,--and give me the money\nto spend where I please.”\n\nMr. Dawkins looked sharply at his son.\n\n“The result would probably be,” he said, “that the money would be\nexpended in other ways, and I should have to pay for the clothes twice\nover.”\n\nDawkins would have indignantly disclaimed this, if he had not felt that\nhe was not altogether sincere in the request he had made.\n\n“No,” continued his father, “I don't like the arrangement you propose.\nWhen you need clothing you can go to my tailor and order it, of course\nnot exceeding reasonable limits.”\n\n“But,” said Dawkins, desperately, “I don't like Bradshaw's style of\nmaking clothes. I would prefer trying some other tailor.”\n\n“What fault have you to find with Bradshaw? Is he not one of the most\nfashionable tailors in the city?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I suppose so, but----”\n\n“Come, sir, you are growing altogether too particular. All your garments\nset well, so far as I can judge.”\n\n“Yes, sir, but one likes a change sometimes,” persisted George, a little\nembarrassed for further objections.\n\n“Well,” said Mr. Dawkins, after a pause, “If you are so strongly bent\nupon a new tailor, select one, and order what you need. You can tell him\nto send in his bill to me.”\n\n“Thank you sir,” said his son, by no means pleased at the manner in\nwhich his request had been granted. He saw that it would in no manner\npromote the plan which he had in view, since it would give him no\ncommand of the ready money. It is hardly necessary to say that his\nalleged dissatisfaction with his father's tailor had all been trumped\nup for the occasion, and would never have been thought of but for the\npresent emergency.\n\n“What shall I do!” thought Dawkins, in perplexity, as he slowly\nundressed himself and retired to bed.\n\nThe only true course, undoubtedly, was to confess all to his father,\nto incur the storm of reproaches which would have followed as the just\npenalty of his transgression, and then the haunting fear of discovery\nwould have been once and forever removed. But Dawkins was not brave\nenough for this. He thought only of escaping from his present difficulty\nwithout his father's knowledge.\n\nHe rose the next morning with the burden of care still weighing upon\nhim. In the evening the thought occurred to him that he might retrieve\nhis losses where he had incurred them, and again he bent his steps to\nthe gambling house. He risked five dollars, being one-half of what he\nhad. This was lost. Desperately he hazarded the remaining five dollars,\nand lost again.\n\nWith a muttered oath he sprang to his feet, and left the brilliant room,\nmore gloomy and discouraged than ever. He was as badly off as before,\nand penniless beside. He would have finished the evening at the theater,\nbut his recent loss prevented that. He lounged about the streets till it\nwas time to go to bed, and then went home in a very unsatisfactory state\nof mind.\n\nA day or two after, he met on Broadway the man whom of all others he\nwould gladly have avoided.\n\n“Aha, my friend, I am glad to meet you,” said Duval, for it was he.\n\nDawkins muttered something unintelligible, and would have hurried on,\nbut Duval detained him.\n\n“Why are you in such a hurry, my friend?” he said.\n\n“Business,” returned Dawkins, shortly.\n\n“That reminds me of the little business affair between us, mon ami. Have\nyou got any money for me?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Not yet! It is three days since we saw each other. Could you not do\nsomething in three days?”\n\n“I told you I required a week,” said Dawkins, roughly, “Let go my arm. I\ntell you I am in haste.”\n\n“Very well, mon ami,” said Duval, slowly relinquishing his hold, “take\ncare that you do not forget. There are four days more to the week.”\n\nDawkins hurried on feeling very uncomfortable. He was quite aware that\nfour days hence he would be as unprepared to encounter the Frenchman as\nnow. Still, something might happen.\n\nSomething, unfortunately, did happen.\n\nThe next day Mr. Danforth was counting a roll of bills which had been\njust paid in, when he was unexpectedly called out of the counting-room.\nHe unguardedly left the bills upon his own desk. Dawkins saw them lying\nthere. The thought flashed upon him, “There lies what will relieve me\nfrom all my embarrassment.”\n\nAllowing himself scarcely a minute to think, he took from the roll four\nfifty dollar notes, thrust one into the pocket of Paul's overcoat, which\nhung up in the office, drew off his right boot and slipped the other\nthree into the bottom of it, and put it on again. He then nervously\nresumed his place at his desk. A moment afterwards, Paul, who had been\nto the post-office, entered with letters which he carried into the inner\noffice and deposited on Mr. Danforth's desk. He observed the roll\nof bills, and thought his employer careless in leaving so much money\nexposed, but said nothing on the subject to Dawkins, between whom and\nhimself there was little communication.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI.\n\nCONVICTED OF THEFT.\n\n\nHalf an hour later Mr. Danforth returned.\n\n“Has any one been here?” he asked as he passed through the outer office.\n\n“No, sir,” said Dawkins, with outward composure though his heart was\nbeating rapidly.\n\nWhile apparently intent upon his writing he listened attentively to what\nmight be going on in the next room. One,--two,--three minutes passed.\nMr. Danforth again showed himself.\n\n“Did you say that no one has been here?” he demanded, abruptly.\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Have either of you been into my office since I have been out?”\n\n“I have not, sir,” said Dawkins.\n\n“I went in to carry your letters,” said Paul.\n\n“Did you see a roll of bills lying on my desk?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Paul, a little surprised at the question.\n\n“I have just counted it over, and find but six hundred dollars instead\nof eight hundred. Can you account for the discrepancy?”\n\nMr. Danforth looked keenly at the two boys. Dawkins, who had schooled\nhimself to the ordeal, maintained his outward calmness. Paul, beginning\nto perceive that his honesty was called in question, flushed.\n\n“No, sir,” said the boys simultaneously.\n\n“It can hardly be possible, that Mr. Thompson, who is a very careful\nman, should have made such a mistake in paying me,” resumed Mr.\nDanforth.\n\n“As we have been the only persons here,” said Dawkins, “the only way to\nvindicate ourselves from suspicion is, to submit to a search.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Paul promptly.\n\nBoth boys turned their pockets inside out, but the missing money was not\nfound.\n\n“There is my overcoat, sir,” said Dawkins, “will you be kind enough to\nsearch it for yourself?”\n\nNext, of course, Paul's overcoat was searched.\n\nWhat was our hero's dismay when from one of the pockets Mr. Danforth\nproduced a fifty dollar bill.\n\n“Is it possible?” he exclaimed in as much grief as surprise, “Unhappy\nboy, how came you by this money in your pocket?”\n\n“I don't know, sir,” returned Paul, his cheek alternately flushing and\ngrowing pale.\n\n“I wish I could believe you,” said Mr. Danforth; “where have you put the\nother bills? Produce them, and I may overlook this first offense.”\n\n“Indeed, sir,” said Paul, in great distress, “I have not the slightest\nknowledge of how this bill came into my pocket. I hope you will believe\nme, sir.”\n\n“How can I? The money evidently did not go into your pocket without\nhands.”\n\nA sudden thought came to Paul. “Dawkins,” said he, “did you put that\nmoney into my pocket?”\n\n“What do you mean, sir?” returned Dawkins, haughtily. “Is it your\nintention to insult me?”\n\nDawkins could not prevent his face from flushing as he spoke, but this\nmight easily be referred to a natural resentment of the imputation cast\nupon him.\n\n“Paul,” said his employer, coldly, “you will not help your own cause\nby seeking to involve another. After what has happened you can hardly\nexpect me to retain you in my employment. I will not make public your\ndisgrace, nor will I inquire farther for the remainder of the money for\nwhich you have been willing to barter your integrity. I will pay your\nwages up to the end of this week, and----”\n\n“Mr. Danforth,” said Paul, manfully, though the tears almost choked his\nutterance, “I am sorry that you have no better opinion of me. I do not\nwant the balance of my wages. If I have taken so large a sum which did\nnot belong to me, I have no claim to them. Good-morning, sir. Sometime I\nhope you will think better of me.”\n\nPaul put on his coat, and taking his cap from the nail on which it hung,\nbowed respectfully to his employer and left the office.\n\nMr. Danforth looked after him, and seemed perplexed. Could Paul be\nguilty after all?\n\n“I never could have suspected him if I had not this evidence in my\nhand,” said Mr. Danforth, to himself, fixing his eyes upon the bill\nwhich he had drawn from Paul's overcoat.\n\n“Dawkins, did you observe whether Paul remained long in the office?” he\nasked.\n\n“Longer than sufficient to lay the letters on the desk?”\n\n“Yes, sir, I think he did.”\n\n“Did you notice whether he went to his overcoat after coming out?”\n\n“Yes, sir, he did,” said Dawkins, anxious to fix in Mr. Danforth's mind\nthe impression of Paul's guilt.\n\n“Then I am afraid it is true,” said his employer sadly. “And yet, what a\nfine, manly boy he is too. But it is a terrible fault.”\n\nMr. Danforth was essentially a kind-hearted man, and he cared much more\nfor Paul's dereliction from honesty than for the loss of the money.\nGoing home early to dinner, he communicated to his wife the unpleasant\ndiscovery which he had made respecting Paul.\n\nNow, from the first, Paul had been a great favorite with Mrs. Danforth,\nand she scouted at the idea of his dishonesty.\n\n“Depend upon it, Mr. Danforth,” she said decisively, “you have done the\nboy an injustice. I have some skill in reading faces, and I tell you\nthat a boy with Paul Prescott's open, frank expression is incapable of\nsuch a crime.”\n\n“So I should have said, my dear, but we men learn to be less trustful\nthan you ladies, who stay at home and take rose-colored views of life.\nUnfortunately, we see too much of the dark side of human nature.”\n\n“So that you conclude all to be dark.”\n\n“Not so bad as that.”\n\n“Tell me all the circumstances, and perhaps a woman's wit may help you.”\n\nMr. Danforth communicated all the details, with which the reader is\nalready familiar.\n\n“What sort of a boy is this Dawkins?” she asked, “Do you like him?”\n\n“Not particularly. He does his duties passably well. I took him into my\ncounting-room to oblige his father.”\n\n“Perhaps he is the thief.”\n\n“To tell the truth I would sooner have suspected him.”\n\n“Has he cleared himself from suspicion?”\n\n“He was the first to suggest a search.”\n\n“Precisely the thing he would have done, if he had placed the bill\nin Paul's pocket. Of course he would know that the search must result\nfavorably for him.”\n\n“There is something in that.”\n\n“Besides, what could have been more foolish, if Paul wished to hide the\nmoney, than to multiply his chances of detection by hiding it in two\ndifferent places, especially where one was so obvious as to afford no\nconcealment at all.”\n\n“Admitting this to be true, how am I to arrive at the proof of Paul's\ninnocence?”\n\n“My own opinion is, that George Dawkins has the greater part of the\nmoney stolen. Probably he has taken it for some particular purpose. What\nit is, you may learn, perhaps, by watching him.”\n\n“I will be guided by your suggestion. Nothing would afford me greater\npleasure than to find that I have been mistaken in assuming Paul's\nguilt, though on evidence that seemed convincing.”\n\nThis conversation took place at the dinner-table. Mr. Danforth\nunderstood that no time was to be lost if he expected to gain any\ninformation from the movements of his clerk.\n\nGeorge Dawkins had ventured upon a bold act, but he had been apparently\nfavored by fortune, and had succeeded. That he should have committed\nthis crime without compunction could hardly be expected. His uneasiness,\nhowever, sprang chiefly from the fear that in some way he might yet\nbe detected. He resolved to get rid of the money which he had\nobtained dishonestly, and obtain back from Duval the acknowledgment of\nindebtedness which he had given him.\n\nYou will perhaps ask whether the wrong which he had done Paul affected\nhim with uneasiness. On the contrary, it gratified the dislike which\nfrom the first he had cherished towards our hero.\n\n“I am well rid of him, at all events,” he muttered to himself, “that is\nworth risking some thing for.”\n\nWhen office hours were over Dawkins gladly threw down his pen, and left\nthe counting-room.\n\nHe bent his steps rapidly towards the locality where he had before met\nDuval. He had decided to wait some time before meeting that worthy. He\nhad to wait till another day, when as he was emerging from the tavern he\nencountered the Frenchman on the threshold.\n\n“Aha, my good friend,” said Duval, offering his hand, which Dawkins did\nnot appear to see, “I am very glad to see you. Will you come in?”\n\n“No, I have not time,” said Dawkins, shortly.\n\n“Have you brought me my money?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Aha, that is well. I was just about what you call cleaned out.”\n\n“Have you my note with you?”\n\nDuval fumbled in his pocket-book, and finally produced the desired\ndocument.\n\n“Give it to me.”\n\n“I must have the money first,” said the Frenchman, shrewdly.\n\n“Take it,” said Dawkins contemptuously. “Do you judge me by yourself?”\n\nHe tore the note which he received into small pieces, and left Duval\nwithout another word.\n\nSheltered by the darkness, Mr. Danforth, who had tracked the steps of\nDawkins, had been an unseen witness of this whole transaction.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII.\n\nRIGHT TRIUMPHANT.\n\n\nGeorge Dawkins resumed his duties the next morning as usual.\nNotwithstanding the crime he had committed to screen himself from the\nconsequences of a lighter fault, he felt immeasurably relieved at the\nthought that he had shaken himself free from the clutches of Duval. His\nsatisfaction was heightened by the disgrace and summary dismissal of\nPaul, whom he had never liked. He decided to ask the place for a cousin\nof his own, whose society would be more agreeable to him than that of\nhis late associate.\n\n“Good-morning, sir,” he said, as Mr. Danforth entered.\n\n“Good-morning,” returned his employer, coldly.\n\n“Have you selected any one in Prescott's place, yet, sir?”\n\n“Why do you ask?”\n\n“Because I have a cousin, Malcolm Harcourt, who would be glad to take\nit.”\n\n“Indeed!” said Mr. Danforth, whose manner somewhat puzzled Dawkins.\n\n“I should enjoy having him with me,” continued Dawkins.\n\n“Did you like Prescott?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Dawkins, promptly, “I didn't want to say so before, but\nnow, since he's turned out so badly, I don't mind saying that I never\nthought much of him.”\n\n“On the contrary,” said Mr. Danforth, “I liked him from the first.\nPerhaps we are wrong in thinking that he took the money.”\n\n“I should think there could be no doubt of it,” said Dawkins, not liking\nthe sympathy and returning good feeling for Paul which his employer\nmanifested.\n\n“I don't agree with you,” said Mr. Danforth, coldly. “I have decided to\nreinstate Paul in his former place.”\n\n“Then, if any more money is missing, you will know where it has gone,”\n said Dawkins, hastily.\n\n“I shall.”\n\n“Then there is no chance for my cousin?”\n\n“I am expecting to have a vacancy.”\n\nDawkins looked up in surprise.\n\n“I shall require some one to fill YOUR place,” said Mr. Danforth,\nsignificantly.\n\n“Sir!” exclaimed Dawkins, in astonishment and dismay.\n\nHis employer bent a searching glance upon him as he asked, sternly,\n“where did you obtain the money which you paid away last evening?”\n\n“I--don't--understand--you, sir,” gasped Dawkins, who understood only\ntoo well.\n\n“You met a man at the door of a low tavern in--Street, last evening, to\nwhom you paid one hundred and fifty dollars, precisely the sum which I\nlost yesterday.”\n\n“Who has been slandering me, sir?” asked Dawkins, very pale.\n\n“An eye-witness of the meeting, who heard the conversation between you.\nIf you want more satisfactory proof, here it is.”\n\nMr. Danforth took from his pocket-book the torn fragments of the note\nwhich Dawkins had given to Duval.\n\n“Here is an obligation to pay a certain Duval the sum of one hundred and\nfifty dollars. It bears your signature. How you could have incurred such\na debt to him you best know.”\n\nDawkins maintained a sullen silence.\n\n“I suppose you wish me to leave your employment,” he said at length.\n\n“You are right. Hold,” he added, as Dawkins was about leaving the room,\n“a word more. It is only just that you should make a restitution of the\nsum which you have taken. If you belonged to a poor family and there\nwere extenuating circumstances, I might forego my claim. But your father\nis abundantly able to make good the loss, and I shall require you to\nlay the matter before him without loss of time. In consideration of your\nyouth, I shall not bring the matter before the public tribunals, as I\nhave a right to do.”\n\nDawkins turned pale at this allusion, and muttering some words to the\neffect that he would do what he could, left the counting-room.\n\nThis threat proved not to be without its effect. The next day he came to\nMr. Danforth and brought the sum for which he had become responsible. He\nhad represented to his father that he had had his pocket picked of this\nsum belonging to Mr. Danforth, and in that manner obtained an equal\namount to replace it. It was some time before Mr. Dawkins learned the\ntruth. Then came a storm of reproaches in which all the bitterness of\nhis father's nature was fully exhibited. There had never been much love\nbetween father and son. Henceforth there was open hatred.\n\nWe must return to Paul, whom we left in much trouble.\n\nIt was a sad walk which he took homeward on the morning of his\ndismissal.\n\n“What brings you home so early?” asked Mrs. Cameron, looking up from her\nbaking, as Paul entered.\n\nPaul tried to explain, but tears came to his eyes, and sobs choked his\nutterance.\n\n“Are you sick, Paul?” exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, in alarm.\n\n“No, Aunt Hester.”\n\n“Then what is the matter?” she asked anxiously.\n\n“I have lost my place.”\n\n“Poor boy! I am very sorry to hear it. But it might have been worse.”\n\n“No, not very well, Aunt Hester, for Mr. Danforth thinks I have taken\nsome of his money.”\n\n“He is very unjust!” exclaimed Aunt Hester, indignantly, “he ought to\nhave known better than to think you would steal.”\n\n“Why, no,” said Paul, candidly, “I must confess the evidence was against\nme, and he doesn't know me as well as you do, Aunt Hester.”\n\n“Tell me all about it, Paul.”\n\nAunt Hester sat down and listened attentively to our hero's story.\n\n“How do you account for the money being found in your pocket?” she asked\nat length.\n\n“I think it must have been put there by some one else.”\n\n“Have you any suspicions?”\n\n“Yes,” said Paul, a little reluctantly, “but I don't know whether I\nought to have. I may be wronging an innocent person.”\n\n“At any rate it won't do any harm to tell me.”\n\n“You've heard me speak of George Dawkins?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I can't help thinking that he put the fifty dollars into my pocket, and\ntook the rest himself.”\n\n“How very wicked he must be!” exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, indignantly.\n\n“Don't judge him too hastily; Aunt Hester, he may not be guilty, and I\nknow from my own experience how hard it is to be accused when you are\ninnocent.”\n\nSoon after the sexton came in, and Paul of course, told his story over\nagain.\n\n“Never mind, Paul,” said Uncle Hugh, cheerily. “You know your own\ninnocence; that is the main thing. It's a great thing to have a clear\nconscience.”\n\n“But I liked Mr. Danforth and I think he liked me. It's hard to feel\nthat he and Mrs. Danforth will both think me guilty, especially after\nthe kindness which I have experienced from them.”\n\n“We all have our crosses, my boy,--some light and others heavy. Yours, I\nadmit is a heavy one for a boy to bear. But when men are unjust there is\nOne above who will deal justly with us. You have not forgotten him.”\n\n“No, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, reverently.\n\n“Trust in him, Paul, and all will come out right at last. He can prove\nyour innocence, and you may be sure he will, in his own good time. Only\nbe patient, Paul.”\n\n“I will try to be, Uncle Hugh.”\n\nThe simple, hearty trust in God, which the sexton manifested, was not\nlost upon Paul. Sustained by his own consciousness of innocence, and\nthe confidence reposed in him by those who knew him best, his mind soon\nregained its cheerful tone. He felt an inward conviction that God would\nvindicate his innocence.\n\nHis vindication came sooner than he anticipated.\n\nThe next day as the sexton's family were seated at their plain dinner, a\nknock was heard upon the outer door.\n\n“Sit still, Hester,” said Mr. Cameron. “I will go to the door.”\n\nOpening the door he recognized Mr. Danforth, who attended the same\nchurch.\n\n“Mr. Cameron, I believe,” said Mr. Danforth, pleasantly.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“May I come in? I am here on a little business.”\n\n“Certainly, Mr. Danforth. Excuse my not inviting you before; but in my\nsurprise at seeing you, I forgot my politeness.”\n\nThe sexton led the way into the plain sitting-room.\n\n“I believe Paul Prescott is an inmate of your family.”\n\n“Yes, sir. I am sorry----”\n\n“I know what you would say, sir; but it is needless. May I see Paul a\nmoment?”\n\nPaul was surprised at the summons, and still more surprised at finding\nwho it was that wished to see him.\n\nHe entered the room slowly, uncertain how to accost Mr. Danforth. His\nemployer solved the doubt in his mind by advancing cordially, and taking\nhis hand.\n\n“Paul,” he said pleasantly, “I have come here to ask your forgiveness\nfor an injustice, and to beg you to resume your place in my\ncounting-room.”\n\n“Have you found out who took the money, sir?” asked Paul, eagerly.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Who was it, sir?”\n\n“It was Dawkins.”\n\nMr. Danforth explained how he had become acquainted with the real thief.\nIn conclusion, he said, “I shall expect you back to-morrow morning,\nPaul.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“Dawkins of course leaves my employ. You will take his place, and\nreceive his salary, seven dollars a week instead of five. Have you any\nfriend whom you would like to have in your own place?”\n\nPaul reflected a moment and finally named a schoolmate of his, the son\nof poor parents, whom he knew to be anxiously seeking a situation, but\nwithout influential friends to help him.\n\n“I will take him on your recommendation,” said Mr. Danforth, promptly.\n“Can you see him this afternoon?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Paul.\n\nThe next day Paul resumed his place in Mr. Danforth's counting-room.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII.\n\nPAUL REDEEMS HIS PLEDGE.\n\n\nTwo years passed, unmarked by any incident of importance. Paul\ncontinued in Mr. Danforth's employment, giving, if possible, increased\nsatisfaction. He was not only faithful, but exhibited a rare aptitude\nfor business, which made his services of great value to his employer.\nFrom time to time Mr. Danforth increased his salary, so that, though\nonly nineteen, he was now receiving twelve dollars per week, with the\nprospect of a speedy increase. But with his increasing salary, he did\nnot increase his expenses. He continued as economical as ever. He had\nnot forgotten his father's dying injunction. He remained true to the\ncharge which he had taken upon himself, that of redeeming his father's\nmemory from reproach. This, at times subjected him to the imputation\nof meanness, but for this he cared little. He would not swerve from the\nline of duty which he had marked out.\n\nOne evening as he was walking down Broadway with an acquaintance, Edward\nHastings, who was employed in a counting-room near him, they paused\nbefore a transparency in front of a hall brilliantly lighted.\n\n“The Hutchinsons are going to sing to-night, Paul,” said Hastings. “Did\nyou ever hear them?”\n\n“No; but I have often wished to.”\n\n“Then suppose we go in.”\n\n“No, I believe not.”\n\n“Why not. Paul? It seems to me you never go anywhere. You ought to amuse\nyourself now and then.”\n\n“Some other time I will,--not now.”\n\n“You are not required to be at home in the evening, are you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then why not come in now? It's only twenty-five cents.”\n\n“To tell the truth, Ned, I am saving up my money for a particular\npurpose; and until that is accomplished, I avoid all unnecessary\nexpense.”\n\n“Going to invest in a house in Fifth Avenue? When you do, I'll call.\nHowever, never mind the expense. I'll pay you in.”\n\n“I'm much obliged to you, Ned, but I can't accept.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because at present I can't afford to return the favor.”\n\n“Never mind that.”\n\n“But I do mind it. By-and-by I shall feel more free. Good-night, if you\nare going in.”\n\n“Good-night, Paul.”\n\n“He's a strange fellow,” mused Hastings.\n\n“It's impossible to think him mean, and yet, it looks a great deal like\nit. He spends nothing for dress or amusements. I do believe that I've\nhad three coats since he's been wearing that old brown one. Yet, he\nalways looks neat. I wonder what he's saving up his money for.”\n\nMeanwhile Paul went home.\n\nThe sexton and his wife looked the same as ever. Paul sometimes fancied\nthat Uncle Hugh stooped a little more than he used to do; but his life\nmoved on so placidly and evenly, that he grew old but slowly. Aunt\nHester was the same good, kind, benevolent friend that she had always\nbeen. No mother could have been more devoted to Paul. He felt that he\nhad much to be grateful for, in his chance meeting with this worthy\ncouple.\n\nIt was the first of January,--a clear, cold day. A pleasant fire burned\nin the little stove. Mr. Cameron sat at one side, reading the evening\npaper; Mrs. Cameron at the other, knitting a stocking for Paul. A large,\ncomfortable-looking cat was dozing tranquilly on the hearth-rug. Paul,\nwho had been seated at the table, rose and lighted a candle.\n\n“Where are you going, Paul?” asked Aunt Hester.\n\n“Up-stairs for a moment.”\n\nPaul speedily returned, bearing in his hand a small blue bank-book, with\nhis name on the cover.\n\nHe took out his pencil and figured a few minutes.\n\n“Uncle Hugh,” said he, looking up, “when I get a hundred dollars more, I\nshall have enough to pay father's debt.”\n\n“Principal and interest?”\n\n“Yes, principal and interest; reckoning the interest for a year to\ncome.”\n\n“I did not suppose you had so much money, Paul. You must have been very\neconomical.”\n\n“Yes, Uncle Hugh more so than I have wanted to be, oftentimes; but\nwhenever I have been tempted to spend a cent unnecessarily, I have\nalways called to mind my promise made to father on his deathbed, and I\nhave denied myself.”\n\n“You have done well, Paul. There are few who would have had the\nresolution to do as you have.”\n\n“Oh yes, Uncle Hugh,” said Paul, modestly, “I think there are a great\nmany. I begin to feel repaid already. In a few months I shall be able to\npay up the whole debt.”\n\nAt this moment a knock was heard at the door. Mr. Cameron answered the\nsummons.\n\n“Does Mr. Paul Prescott live here?” inquired a boy.\n\n“Yes. Do you want to see him?”\n\n“Here is a letter for him. There is no answer.”\n\nThe messenger departed, leaving the letter in Mr. Cameron's hand.\n\nSomewhat surprised, he returned to the sitting-room and handed it to\nPaul.\n\nPaul opened it hastily, and discovered inclosed, a bank-note for one\nhundred dollars. It was accompanied with a note from his employer,\nstating that it was intended as a New Year's gift, but in the hurry of\nbusiness, he had forgotten to give it to him during the day.\n\nPaul's face lighted up with joy.\n\n“Oh, Uncle Hugh!” he exclaimed, almost breathless with delight. “Don't\nyou see that this will enable me to pay my debt at once?”\n\n“So it will, Paul. I wish you joy.”\n\n“And my father's memory will be vindicated,” said Paul, in a tone of\ndeep satisfaction. “If he could only have lived to see this day!”\n\nA fortnight later, Paul obtained permission from his employer to\nbe absent from the office for a week. It was his purpose to visit\nCedarville and repay 'Squire Conant the debt due him: and then, to go\nacross the country to Wrenville, thirty miles distant, to see Aunt Lucy\nLee. First, however, he ordered a new suit of a tailor, feeling a desire\nto appear to the best advantage on his return to the scene of his former\nhumiliation. I must not omit to say that Paul was now a fine-looking\nyoung fellow of nineteen, with a frank, manly face, that won favor\nwherever he went.\n\nIn due course of time, he arrived at Cedarville, and found his way\nwithout difficulty to the house of 'Squire Conant.\n\nIt was a large house, rather imposing in its exterior, being quite the\nfinest residence in the village.\n\nPaul went up the walk, and rang the bell.\n\n“Can I see 'Squire Conant?” he asked of the servant who answered the\nbell.\n\n“You'll find him in that room,” said the girl, pointing to a door on the\nleft hand of the hall.\n\n“As he doesn't know me, perhaps you had better go before.”\n\nThe door was opened, and Paul found himself in the presence of his\nfather's creditor. 'Squire Conant was looking pale and thin. He was just\nrecovering from a severe sickness.\n\n“I presume you don't recognize me, sir,” said Paul.\n\n“Did I ever see you before?”\n\n“Yes, sir; my name is Paul Prescott.”\n\n“Not the son of John Prescott?”\n\n“The same, sir. I believe my father died in your debt.”\n\n“Yes. I lent him five hundred dollars, which he never repaid.”\n\n“He tried to do so, sir. He had saved up a hundred and fifty dollars\ntowards it, but sickness came upon him, and he was obliged to use it.”\n\n'Squire Conant's temper had been subdued by the long and dangerous\nillness through which he had passed. It had made him set a smaller value\non his earthly possessions, from which he might be separated at any\nmoment. When he answered Paul, it was in a manner which our hero did not\nexpect.\n\n“Never mind. I can afford to lose it. I have no doubt he did what he\ncould.”\n\n“But I have come to pay it, sir,” said Paul.\n\n“You!” exclaimed 'Squire Conant, in the greatest astonishment.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Where did you get the money?”\n\n“I earned it, sir.”\n\n“But you are very young. How could you have earned so much?”\n\nPaul frankly told the story of his struggles; how for years he had\npractised a pinching economy, in order to redeem his father's memory\nfrom reproach.\n\n'Squire Conant listened attentively.\n\n“You are a good boy,” he said, at length.\n\n“Shall you have anything left after paying this money?”\n\n“No, sir; but I shall soon earn more.”\n\n“Still, you ought to have something to begin the world with. You shall\npay me half the money, and I will cancel the note.”\n\n“But, sir,----”\n\n“Not a word. I am satisfied, and that is enough. If I hadn't lent your\nfather the money, I might have invested it with the rest, and lost all.”\n\n'Squire Conant produced the note from a little trunk of papers, and\nhanded it to Paul, who paid him the amount which he had stipulated,\nexpressing at the same time his gratitude for his unexpected generosity.\n\n“Never mind about thanks, my boy,” said 'Squire Conant: “I am afraid I\nhave loved money too well heretofore. I hope I am not too old to turn\nover a new leaf.”\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV.\n\nHOW PAUL GOES BACK TO WRENVILLE.\n\n\nWhile 'Squire Conant was speaking, Paul formed a sudden resolution. He\nremembered that Aunt Lucy Lee was a sister of 'Squire Conant. Perhaps,\nin his present frame of mind, it might be possible to induce him to do\nsomething for her.\n\n“I believe I am acquainted with a sister of yours, 'Squire Conant,” he\ncommenced.\n\n“Ha!” exclaimed the 'Squire.\n\n“Mrs. Lucy Lee.”\n\n“Yes,” was the slow reply; “she is my sister. Where did you meet her?”\n\n“At the Wrenville Poorhouse.”\n\n“How long ago?”\n\n“About six years since.”\n\n“Is she there, still?”\n\n“Yes, sir. Since I have been in New York, I have heard from her\nfrequently. I am going from here to visit her. Have you any message,\nsir? I am sure she would be glad to hear from you.”\n\n“She shall hear from me,” said the 'Squire in a low voice. “Sit down,\nand I will write her a letter which, I hope, will not prove unwelcome.”\n\nFive minutes afterwards he handed Paul an open letter.\n\n“You may read it,” he said, abruptly.\n\n“You have been a better friend to my sister than I. You shall witness my\nlate reparation.”\n\nThe letter was as follows:----\n\nCEDARVILLE, JAN 13, 18--.\n\nMY DEAR SISTER:--\n\nI hope you will forgive me for my long neglect. It is not fitting that\nwhile I am possessed of abundant means you should longer remain the\ntenant of an almshouse. I send you by the bearer of this note, Paul\nPrescott, who, I understand, is a friend of yours, the sum of three\nhundred dollars. The same sum will be sent you annually. I hope it will\nbe sufficient to maintain you comfortably. I shall endeavor to call upon\nyou soon, and meanwhile remain, Your affectionate brother,\n\nEZEKIEL CONANT.\n\n\nPaul read this letter with grateful joy. It seemed almost to good to be\ntrue. Aunt Lucy would be released from the petty tyranny of Mrs. Mudge's\nhousehold, and perhaps--he felt almost sure Aunt Hester would be willing\nto receive her as a boarder, thus insuring her a peaceful and happy home\nin her declining years.\n\n“Oh, sir,” said he, seizing 'Squire Conant's hand, “you cannot tell how\nhappy you have made me.”\n\n“It is what I ought to have done before. Here is the money referred to\nin the letter,--three hundred dollars,--mind you don't lose it.”\n\n“I will take every care, sir.”\n\n“You may tell my sister that I shall be happy to have her write me.”\n\n“I will, sir.”\n\nPaul left 'Squire Conant's house, feeling that he had great cause for\njoy. The 'Squire's refusal to receive more than half the debt, left him\nmaster of over three hundred dollars. But I am not sure whether he did\nnot rejoice even more over the good fortune which had come to Aunt Lucy\nLee, whose kindness to him, in his unfriended boyhood, he would ever\nhold in grateful remembrance. He enjoyed in anticipation the joy\nwhich he knew Aunt Lucy would feel when the change in her fortunes was\ncommunicated to her. He knew also how great would be the chagrin of Mr.\nand Mrs. Mudge, when they found that the meek old lady whom they hated\nwas about to be rescued from their clutches. On the whole, Paul felt\nthat this was the happiest day of his life. It was a satisfaction to\nfeel that the good fortune of his early friend was all due to his own\nintercession.\n\nHe was able to take the cars to a point four miles distant from\nWrenville. On getting out on the platform he inquired whether there was\na livery stable near by. He was directed to one but a few rods distant.\nEntering he asked, “Can you let me have a horse and chaise to go to\nWrenville?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said the groom.\n\n“Let me have the best horse in the stable,” said Paul, “and charge me\naccordingly.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said the groom, respectfully, judging from Paul's dress and\ntone that he was a young gentleman of fortune.\n\nA spirited animal was brought out, and Paul was soon seated in the\nchaise driving along the Wrenville road. Paul's city friends would\nhardly have recognized their economical acquaintance in the well-dressed\nyoung man who now sat behind a fast horse, putting him through his best\npaces. It might have been a weakness in Paul, but he remembered the\nmanner in which he left Wrenville, an unfriended boy, compelled to fly\nfrom persecution under the cover of darkness, and he felt a certain\npride in showing the Mudges that his circumstances were now entirely\nchanged. It was over this very road that he had walked with his little\nbundle, in the early morning, six years before. It seemed to him almost\nlike a dream.\n\nAt length he reached Wrenville. Though he had not been there for six\nyears, he recognized the places that had once been familiar to him. But\neverything seemed to have dwindled. Accustomed to large city warehouses,\nthe houses in the village seemed very diminutive. Even 'Squire Benjamin\nNewcome's house, which he had once regarded as a stately mansion, now\nlooked like a very ordinary dwelling.\n\nAs he rode up the main street of the village, many eyes were fixed\nupon him and his carriage, but no one thought of recognizing, in\nthe well-dressed youth, the boy who had run away from the Wrenville\nPoorhouse.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nAt the very moment that Paul was driving through the village street,\nMr. Nicholas Mudge entered the Poorhouse in high spirits. Certainly\nill-fortune must have befallen some one to make the good man so\nexhilarant.\n\nTo explain, Mr. Mudge had just been to the village store to purchase\nsome groceries. One of his parcels was tied up in a stray leaf of a\nrecent New York Daily, in which he discovered an item which he felt\nsure would make Aunt Lucy unhappy. He communicated it to Mrs. Mudge,\nwho highly approved his design. She called the old lady from the common\nroom.\n\n“Here, Aunt Lucy,” she said, “is something that will interest you.”\n\nAunt Lucy came in, wondering a little at such an unusual mark of\nattention.\n\nMrs. Mudge immediately commenced reading with malicious emphasis a\nparagraph concerning a certain Paul Prescott, who had been arrested\nfor thieving, and sentenced to the House of Reformation for a term of\nmonths.\n\n“There,” said Mrs. Mudge, triumphantly, “what do you say to your\nfavorite now? Turned out well, hasn't he? Didn't I always say so? I\nalways knew that boy was bad at heart, and that he'd come to a bad end.”\n\n“I don't believe it's the same boy,” declared Aunt Lucy, who was\nnevertheless unpleasantly affected by the paragraph. She thought it\npossible that Paul might have yielded to a powerful temptation.\n\n“Perhaps you think I've been making it up. If you don't believe it look\nat the paper for yourself,” thrusting it into Aunt Lucy's hands.\n\n“Yes,” said the old lady. “I see that the name is the same; but, for\nall that, there is a mistake somewhere. I do not believe it is the same\nboy.”\n\n“You don't? Just as if there would be more than one boy of that name.\nThere may be other Prescotts, but there isn't but one Paul Prescott,\ntake my word for it.”\n\n“If it is he,” said Aunt Lucy, indignantly, “is it Christianlike to\nrejoice over the poor boy's misfortune?”\n\n“Misfortune!” retorted Mrs. Mudge with a sneer; “you call it a\nmisfortune to steal, then! I call it a crime.”\n\n“It's often misfortune that drives people to it, though,” continued the\nold lady, looking keenly at Mrs. Mudge. “I have known cases where they\ndidn't have that excuse.”\n\nMrs. Mudge colored.\n\n“Go back to your room,” said she, sharply; “and don't stay here accusing\nme and Mr. Mudge of unchristian conduct. You're the most troublesome\npauper we have on our hands; and I do wish the town would provide for\nyou somewhere else.”\n\n“So do I,” sighed the old lady to herself, though she did not think fit\nto give audible voice to her thoughts.\n\nIt was at this moment that Paul halted his chaise at the gate, and\nlightly jumping out, fastened his horse to a tree, and walked up to the\nfront door.\n\n“Who can it be?” thought Mrs. Mudge, hastily adjusting her cap, and\ntaking off her apron.\n\n“I don't know, I'm sure,” said Mr. Mudge, unsuspiciously.\n\n“I declare! I look like a fright.”\n\n“No worse than usual,” said her husband, gallantly.\n\nBy this time Paul had knocked.\n\n“Good-morning, sir,” said Mrs. Mudge, deferentially, her respect excited\nby Paul's dress and handsome chaise.\n\n“Is Mrs. Lee in?” inquired Paul, not caring to declare himself, yet, to\nhis old enemy.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Mudge, obsequiously, though not overpleased to find\nthat this was Aunt Lucy's visitor; “would you like to see her?”\n\n“If you please.”\n\n“What can he want of the old lady?” thought Mrs. Mudge, as she went to\nsummon her.\n\n“A visitor for me?” asked Aunt Lucy, looking at Mrs. Mudge somewhat\nsuspiciously.\n\n“Yes; and as he's come in a carriage, you'd better slick up a little;\nput on a clean cap or something.”\n\nAunt Lucy was soon ready.\n\nShe looked wonderingly at Paul, not recognizing him.\n\n“You are not very good at remembering your old friends,” said Paul, with\na smile.\n\n“What!” exclaimed Aunt Lucy, her face lighting up with joy; “are you\nlittle Paul?”\n\n“Not very little, now,” said our hero, laughing; “but I'm the same Paul\nyou used to know.”\n\nMrs. Mudge, who through the half open door had heard this revelation,\nwas overwhelmed with astonishment and confusion. She hurried to her\nhusband.\n\n“Wonders will never cease!” she exclaimed, holding up both hands. “If\nthat doesn't turn out to be Paul Prescott. Of course he's up in the\nworld, or he wouldn't dress so well, and ride in such a handsome\ncarriage.”\n\n“You don't say so!” returned Mr. Mudge, who looked as if he had heard of\na heavy misfortune.\n\n“Yes, I do; I heard him say so with his own lips. It's a pity you showed\nthat paragraph to Aunt Lucy, this morning.”\n\n“That you showed, you mean,” retorted her husband.\n\n“No, I don't. You know it was you that did it.”\n\n“Hush; they'll hear.”\n\nMeanwhile the two friends were conversing together happily.\n\n“I'm so glad you're doing so well, Paul,” said Aunt Lucy. “It was a\nlucky day when you left the Poorhouse behind you.”\n\n“Yes, Aunt Lucy, and to-day is a lucky day for you. There's room for two\nin that chaise, and I'm going to take you away with me.”\n\n“I should enjoy a ride, Paul. It's a long time since I have taken one.”\n\n“You don't understand me. You're going away not to return.”\n\nThe old lady smiled sadly.\n\n“No, no, Paul. I can't consent to become a burden upon your generosity.\nYou can't afford it, and it will not be right.”\n\n“O,” said Paul, smiling, “you give me credit for too much. I mean that\nyou shall pay your board.”\n\n“But you know I have no money.”\n\n“No, I don't. I don't consider that a lady is penniless, who has an\nincome of three hundred dollars a year.”\n\n“I don't understand you, Paul.”\n\n“Then, perhaps you will understand this,” said our hero, enjoying the\nold lady's astonishment.\n\nHe drew from his pocket a roll of bills, and passed them to Aunt Lucy.\n\nThe old lady looked so bewildered, that he lost no time in explaining\nthe matter to her. Then, indeed, Aunt Lucy was happy; not only because\nshe had become suddenly independent, but, because after years of\ncoldness and estrangement, her brother had at last become reconciled to\nher.\n\n“Now, Aunt Lucy,” resumed Paul, “I'll tell you what my plans are. You\nshall get into the chaise with me, and go at once to New York. I think\nAunt Hester will be willing to receive you as a boarder; if not, I will\nfind you a pleasant place near by. Will that suit you?”\n\n“It will make me very happy; but I cannot realize it. It seems like a\ndream.”\n\nAt this moment Mrs. Mudge entered the room, and, after a moment's\nscrutiny, pretended to recognize Paul. Her husband followed close behind\nher.\n\n“Can I believe my eyes?” she exclaimed. “Is this indeed Paul Prescott? I\nam very glad to see you back.”\n\n“Only a visit, Mrs. Mudge,” said Paul, smiling.\n\n“You'll stop to dinner, I hope?”\n\nPaul thought of the soup and dry bread which he used to find so\nuninviting, and said that he should not have time to do so.\n\n“We've thought of you often,” said Mr. Mudge, writhing his harsh\nfeatures into a smile. “There's scarcely a day that we haven't spoken of\nyou.”\n\n“I ought to feel grateful for your remembrance,” said Paul, his eyes\ntwinkling with mirth. “But I don't think, Mr. Mudge, you always thought\nso much of me.”\n\nMr. Mudge coughed in some embarrassment, and not thinking of anything in\nparticular to say, said nothing.\n\n“I am going to take from you another of your boarders,” said Paul. “Can\nyou spare Aunt Lucy?”\n\n“For how long?” asked Mrs. Mudge.\n\n“For all the time. She has just come into possession of a little\nproperty,--several hundred dollars a year,--and I have persuaded her to\ngo to New York to board.”\n\n“Is this true?” exclaimed Mrs. Mudge in astonishment.\n\n“Yes,” said the old lady, “God has been bountiful to me when I least\nexpected it.”\n\n“Can I be of any service in assisting you to pack up, Mrs. Lee?”\n asked Mrs. Mudge, with new-born politeness. She felt that as a lady of\nproperty, Aunt Lucy was entitled to much greater respect and deference\nthan before.\n\n“Thank you, Mrs. Mudge,” said Paul, answering for her.\n\n“She won't have occasion for anything in this house. She will get a\nsupply of new things when she gets to New York.”\n\nThe old lady looked very happy, and Mrs. Mudge, in spite of her outward\ndeference, felt thoroughly provoked at her good fortune.\n\nI will not dwell upon the journey to New York. Aunt Lucy, though\nsomewhat fatigued, bore it much better than she had anticipated. Mr. and\nMrs. Cameron entered very heartily into Paul's plans, and readily agreed\nto receive Aunt Lucy as an inmate of their happy and united household.\nThe old lady felt it to be a happy and blessed change from the\nPoorhouse, where scanty food and poor accommodations had been made\nharder to bear by the ill temper of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, to a home whose\natmosphere was peace and kindness.\n\n*****\n\nAnd now, dear reader, it behooves us to draw together the different\nthreads of our story, and bring all to a satisfactory end.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Mudge are no longer in charge of the Wrenville Poorhouse.\nAfter Aunt Lucy's departure, Mrs. Mudge became so morose and despotic,\nthat her rule became intolerable. Loud complaints came to the ears of\n'Squire Newcome, Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor. One fine morning\nhe was compelled to ride over and give the interesting couple warning\nto leave immediately. Mr. Mudge undertook the charge of a farm, but his\nhabits of intoxication increased upon him to such an extent, that he was\nfound dead one winter night, in a snow-drift, between his own house and\nthe tavern. Mrs. Mudge was not extravagant in her expressions of grief,\nnot having a very strong affection for her husband. At last accounts,\nshe was keeping a boarding-house in a manufacturing town. Some time\nsince, her boarders held an indignation meeting, and threatened to\nleave in a body unless she improved her fare,--a course to which she was\nobliged to submit.\n\nGeorge Dawkins, unable to obtain a recommendation from Mr. Danforth, did\nnot succeed in securing another place in New York. He finally prevailed\nupon his father to advance him a sum of money, with which he went to\nCalifornia. Let us hope that he may “turn over a new leaf” there, and\nestablish a better reputation than he did in New York.\n\nMr. Stubbs is still in the tin business. He is as happy as the day is\nlong, and so are his wife and children. Once a year he comes to New York\nand pays Paul a visit. This supplies him with something to talk about\nfor the rest of the year. He is frugal in his expenses, and is able\nto lay up a couple of hundred dollars every year, which he confides to\nPaul, in whose financial skill he has the utmost confidence.\n\nI am sure my boy readers would not forgive me for omitting to tell them\nsomething more about Ben Newcome. Although his mirthful spirit sometimes\nled him into mischief, he was good-hearted, and I have known him do many\nan act of kindness, even at considerable trouble to himself. It will be\nremembered that in consequence of his night adventure, during which\nhe personated a ghost, much to the terror of Mr. Mudge his father\ndetermined to send him to a military school. This proved to be a\nwise arrangement. The discipline was such as Ben needed, and he soon\ndistinguished himself by his excellence in the military drill. Soon\nafter he graduated, the Rebellion broke out, and Ben was at once, in\nspite of his youth, elected Captain of the Wrenville company. At the\nbattle of Antietam he acquitted himself with so much credit that he\nwas promoted to a major. He was again promoted, and when Richmond was\nevacuated, he was one of the first officers to enter the streets of the\nRebel capital, a colonel in command of his regiment. I have heard on\nhigh authority, that he is considered one of the best officers in the\nservice.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Cameron are still living. They are happy in the success and\nincreasing prosperity of Paul, whom they regard as a son. Between them\nand Aunt Lucy he would stand a very fair chance of being spoiled, if his\nown good sense and good judgment were not sufficient to save him from\nsuch a misfortune. Paul is now admitted to a small interest in the firm,\nwhich entitles him to a share in the profits. As Danforth and Co. have\ndone a very extensive business of late years, this interest brings him\nin a very handsome income. There is only one cause of difference between\nhim and the sexton. He insists that Uncle Hugh, who is getting infirm,\nshould resign his office, as he is abundantly able to support the whole\nfamily. But the good sexton loves his duties, and will continue to\ndischarge them as long as he is able.\n\nAnd now we must bid farewell to Paul. He has battled bravely with the\ndifficulties and discouragements that beset him in early life, he\nhas been faithful to the charge which he voluntarily assumed, and his\nfather's memory is free from reproach. He often wishes that his father\ncould have lived to witness his prosperity? but God has decreed it\notherwise. Happy in the love of friends, and in the enjoyment of all\nthat can make life desirable, so far as external circumstances have that\npower, let us all wish him God speed!"
