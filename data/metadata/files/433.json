 "text": "THE CONFLICT\n\n\nby\n\nDavid Graham Phillips\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nFour years at Wellesley; two years about equally divided among Paris,\nDresden and Florence.  And now Jane Hastings was at home again.  At\nhome in the unchanged house--spacious, old-fashioned--looking down from\nits steeply sloping lawns and terraced gardens upon the sooty, smoky\nactivities of Remsen City, looking out upon a charming panorama of\nhills and valleys in the heart of South Central Indiana.  Six years of\nstriving in the East and abroad to satisfy the restless energy she\ninherited from her father; and here she was, as restless as ever--yet\nwith everything done that a woman could do in the way of an active\ncareer.  She looked back upon her years of elaborate preparation; she\nlooked forward upon--nothing.  That is, nothing but marriage--dropping\nher name, dropping her personality, disappearing in the personality of\nanother.  She had never seen a man for whom she would make such a\nsacrifice; she did not believe that such a man existed.\n\nShe meditated bitterly upon that cruel arrangement of Nature's whereby\nthe father transmits his vigorous qualities in twofold measure to the\ndaughter, not in order that she may be a somebody, but solely in order\nthat she may transmit them to sons.  \"I don't believe it,\" she decided.\n\"There's something for ME to do.\"  But what?  She gazed down at Remsen\nCity, connected by factories and pierced from east, west and south by\nrailways.  She gazed out over the fields and woods.  Yes, there must be\nsomething for her besides merely marrying and breeding--just as much\nfor her as for a man.  But what?  If she should marry a man who would\nlet her rule him, she would despise him.  If she should marry a man she\ncould respect--a man who was of the master class like her father--how\nshe would hate him for ignoring her and putting her in her ordained\ninferior feminine place.  She glanced down at her skirts with an angry\nsense of enforced masquerade. And then she laughed--for she had a keen\nsense of humor that always came to her rescue when she was in danger of\ntaking herself too seriously.\n\nThrough the foliage between her and the last of the stretches of\nhighroad winding up from Remsen City she spied a man climbing in her\ndirection--a long, slim figure in cap, Norfolk jacket and\nknickerbockers.  Instantly--and long before he saw her--there was a\ngrotesque whisking out of sight of the serious personality upon which\nwe have been intruding.  In its stead there stood ready to receive the\nyoung man a woman of the type that possesses physical charm and knows\nhow to use it--and does not scruple to use it. For a woman to conquer\nman by physical charm is far and away the easiest, the most fleeting\nand the emptiest of victories.  But for woman thus to conquer without\nherself yielding anything whatsoever, even so little as an alluring\nglance of the eye--that is quite another matter.  It was this sort of\nconquest that Jane Hastings delighted in--and sought to gain with any\nman who came within range.  If the men had known what she was about,\nthey would have denounced her conduct as contemptible and herself as\nimmoral, even brazen.  But in their innocence they accused only their\nsophisticated and superbly masculine selves and regarded her as the\nsoul of innocence.  This was the more absurd in them because she\nobviously excelled in the feminine art of inviting display of charm.\nTo glance at her was to realize at once the beauty of her figure, the\nexceeding grace of her long back and waist.  A keen observer would have\nseen the mockery lurking in her light-brown eyes, and about the corners\nof her full red lips.\n\nShe arranged her thick dark hair to make a secret, half-revealed charm\nof her fascinating pink ears and to reveal in dazzling unexpectedness\nthe soft, round whiteness of the nape of her neck.\n\nBecause you are thus let into Miss Hastings' naughty secret, so well\nveiled behind an air of earnest and almost cold dignity, you must not\ndo her the injustice of thinking her unusually artful. Such artfulness\nis common enough; it secures husbands by the thousand and by the tens\nof thousands.  No, only in the skill of artfulness was Miss Hastings\nunusual.\n\nAs the long strides of the tall, slender man brought him rapidly\nnearer, his face came into plain view.  A refined, handsome face, dark\nand serious.  He had dark-brown eyes--and Miss Hastings did not like\nbrown eyes in a man.  She thought that men should have gray or blue or\ngreenish eyes, and if they were cruel in their love of power she liked\nit the better.\n\n\"Hello, Dave,\" she cried in a pleasant, friendly voice.  She was\nposed--in the most unconscious of attitudes--upon a rustic bench so\nthat her extraordinary figure was revealed at its most attractive.\n\nThe young man halted before her, his breath coming quickly--not\naltogether from the exertion of his steep and rapid climb. \"Jen, I'm\nmad about you,\" he said, his brown eyes soft and luminous with passion.\n\"I've done nothing but think about you in the week you've been back.  I\ndidn't sleep last night, and I've come up here as early as I dared to\ntell you--to ask you to marry me.\"\n\nHe did not see the triumph she felt, the joy in having subdued another\nof these insolently superior males.  Her eyes were discreetly veiled;\nher delightful mouth was arranged to express sadness.\n\n\"I thought I was an ambition incarnate,\" continued the young man,\nunwittingly adding to her delight by detailing how brilliant her\nconquest was.  \"I've never cared a rap about women--until I saw you.  I\nwas all for politics--for trying to do something to make my fellow men\nthe better for my having lived.  Now--it's all gone.  I want you, Jen.\nNothing else matters.\"\n\nAs he paused, gazing at her in speechless longing, she lifted her\neyes--simply a glance.  With a stifled cry he darted forward, dropped\nbeside her on the bench and tried to enfold her in his arms.  The veins\nstood out in his forehead; the expression of his eyes was terrifying.\n\nShe shrank, sprang up.  His baffled hands had not even touched her.\n\"David Hull!\" she cried, and the indignation and the repulsion in her\ntone and in her manner were not simulated, though her artfulness\nhastened to make real use of them.  She loved to rouse men to frenzy.\nShe knew that the sight of their frenzy would chill her--would fill her\nwith an emotion that would enable her to remain mistress of the\nsituation.\n\nAt sight of her aversion his eyes sank.  \"Forgive me,\" he muttered.\n\"You make me--CRAZY.\"\n\n\"I!\" she cried, laughing in angry derision.  \"What have I ever done to\nencourage you to be--impertinent?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he admitted.  \"That is, nothing but just being yourself.\"\n\n\"I can't help that, can I?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, adding doggedly:  \"But neither can men help going crazy\nabout you.\"\n\nShe looked at him sitting there at once penitent and impenitent; and\nher mind went back to the thoughts that had engaged it before he came\ninto view.  Marriage--to marry one of these men, with their coarse\nphysical ideas of women, with their pitiful weakness before an emotion\nthat seemed to her to have no charm whatever. And these were the\ncreatures who ruled the world and compelled women to be their\nplaythings and mere appendages!  Well--no doubt it was the women's own\nfault, for were they not a poor, spiritless lot, trembling with fright\nlest they should not find a man to lean on and then, having found the\nman, settling down into fat and stupid vacuity or playing the cat at\nthe silly game of social position?  But not Jane Hastings!  Her bosom\nheaved and her eyes blazed scorn as she looked at this person who had\ndared think the touch of his coarse hands would be welcome.  Welcome!\n\n\"And I have been thinking what a delightful friendship ours was,\" said\nshe, disgustedly.  \"And all the time, your talk about your\nambition--the speeches you were going to make--the offices you were\ngoing to hold--the good you were going to do in purifying politics--it\nwas all a blind!\"\n\n\"All a blind,\" admitted he.  \"From the first night that you came to our\nhouse to dinner--Jen, I'll never forget that dress you wore--or the way\nyou looked in it.\"\n\nMiss Jane had thought extremely well of that toilet herself.  She had\nheard how impervious this David Hull, the best catch in the town, was\nto feminine charm; and she had gone prepared to give battle.  But she\nsaid dejectedly, \"You don't know what a shock you've given me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" cried he.  \"I'm ashamed of myself.  But--I love you, Jen!\nCan't you learn to love me?\"\n\n\"I hadn't even thought of you in that way,\" said she.  \"I haven't\nbothered my head about marriage.  Of course, most girls have to think\nabout it, because they must get some one to support them----\"\n\n\"I wish to God you were one of that sort,\" interrupted he. \"Then I\ncould have some hope.\"\n\n\"Hope of what,\" said she disdainfully.  \"You don't mean that you'd\nmarry a girl who was marrying you because she had to have food,\nclothing and shelter?\"\n\n\"I'd marry the woman I loved.  Then--I'd MAKE her love me.  She simply\ncouldn't help it.\"\n\nJane Hastings shuddered.  \"Thank heaven, I don't have to marry!\"  Her\neyes flashed.  \"But I wouldn't, even if I were poor.  I'd rather go to\nwork.  Why shouldn't a woman work, anyhow?\"\n\n\"At what?\" inquired Hull.  \"Except the men who do manual labor, there\nare precious few men who can make a living honestly and\nself-respectingly.  It's fortunate the women can hold aloof and remain\npure.\"\n\nJane laughed unpleasantly.  \"I'm not so sure that the women who live\nwith men just for shelter are pure,\" said she.\n\n\"Jen,\" the young man burst out, \"you're ambitious--aren't you?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" replied she.\n\n\"And you like the sort of thing I'm trying to do--like it and approve\nof it?\"\n\n\"I believe a man ought to succeed--get to the top.\"\n\n\"So do I--if he can do it honorably.\"\n\nJane hesitated--dared.  \"To be quite frank,\" said she, \"I worship\nsuccess and I despise failure.  Success means strength. Failure means\nweakness--and I abominate weakness.\"\n\nHe looked quietly disapproving.  \"You don't mean that.  You don't\nunderstand what you're saying.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" she assured him.  \"I'm not a bit good.  Education has\ntaken all the namby-pamby nonsense out of me.\"\n\nBut he was not really hearing; besides, what had women to do with the\nrealities of life?  They were made to be the property of men--that was\nthe truth, though he would never have confessed it to any woman.  They\nwere made to be possessed.  \"And I must possess this woman,\" he\nthought, his blood running hot.  He said:\n\n\"Why not help me to make a career?  I can do it, Jen, with you to help.\"\n\nShe had thought of this before--of making a career for herself, of\ndoing the \"something\" her intense energy craved, through a man.  The\n\"something\" must be big if it were to satisfy her; and what that was\nbig could a woman do except through a man? But--this man.  Her eyes\nturned thoughtfully upon him--a look that encouraged him to go on:\n\n\"Politics interest you, Jen.  I've seen that in the way you listen and\nin the questions you ask.\"\n\nShe smiled--but not at the surface.  In fact, his political talk had\nbored her.  She knew nothing about the subject, and, so, had been as\none listening to an unknown language.  But, like all women, having only\nthe narrowest range of interests herself and the things that would\nenable her to show off to advantage, she was used to being bored by the\nconversational efforts of men and to concealing her boredom.  She had\nlistened patiently and had led the conversation by slow, imperceptible\nstages round to the interesting personal--to the struggle for dominion\nover this difficult male.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he went on, \"no intelligent person could fail to be\ninterested in politics, once he or she appreciated what it meant. And\npeople of our class owe it to society to take part in politics.  Victor\nDorn is a crank, but he's right about some things--and he's right in\nsaying that we of the upper class are parasites upon the masses.  They\nearn all the wealth, and we take a large part of it away from them.\nAnd it's plain stealing unless we give some service in return.  For\ninstance, you and I--what have we done, what are we doing that entitles\nus to draw so much?  Somebody must earn by hard labor all that is\nproduced. We are not earning.  So\"--he was looking handsome now in his\nmanly earnestness--\"Jen, it's up to us to do our share--to stop\nstealing--isn't it?\"\n\nShe was genuinely interested.  \"I hadn't thought of these things,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Victor Dorn says we ought to go to work like laborers,\" pursued David.\n\"But that's where he's a crank.  The truth is, we ought to give the\nservice of leadership--especially in politics.  And I'm going to do it,\nJane Hastings!\"\n\nFor the first time she had an interest in him other than that of\nconquest.  \"Just what are you going to do?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not upset everything and tear everything to pieces, as Victor Dorn\nwants to do,\" replied he.  \"But reform the abuses and wrongs--make it\nso that every one shall have a fair chance--make politics straight and\nhonest.\"\n\nThis sounded hazy to her.  \"And what will you get out of it?\" asked she.\n\nHe colored and was a little uneasy as he thus faced a direct demand for\nhis innermost secret--the secret of selfishness he tried to hide even\nfrom himself.  But there was no evading; if he would interest her he\nmust show her the practical advantages of his proposal.  \"If I'm to do\nany good,\" said he, putting the best face, and really not a bad face,\nupon a difficult and delicate matter--\"if I'm to do any good I must win\na commanding position--must get to be a popular leader--must hold high\noffices--and--and--all that.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said she.  \"That sounds attractive.  Yes, David, you\nought to make a career.  If I were a man that's the career I'd choose.\"\n\n\"You can choose it, though you're a woman,\" rejoined he. \"Marry me, and\nwe'll go up together.  You've no idea how exciting campaigns and\nelections are.  A little while, and you'll be crazy about it all.  The\nwomen are taking part, more and more.\"\n\n\"Who's Victor Dorn?\" she suddenly asked.\n\n\"You must remember him.  It was his father that was killed by the\nrailway the day we all went on that excursion to Indianapolis.\"\n\n\"Dorn the carpenter,\" said Jane.  \"Yes--I remember.\"  Her face grew\ndreamy with the effort of memory.  \"I see it all again.  And there was\na boy with a very white face who knelt and held his head.\"\n\n\"That was Victor,\" said Hull.\n\n\"Yes--I remember him.  He was a bad boy--always fighting and robbing\norchards and getting kept after school.\"\n\n\"And he's still a bad boy--but in a different way.  He's out against\neverything civilized and everybody that's got money.\"\n\n\"What does he do?  Keep a saloon?\"\n\n\"No, but he spends a lot of time at them.  I must say for him that he\ndoesn't drink--and professes not to believe in drink. When I pointed\nout to him what a bad example he set, loafing round saloons, he laughed\nat me and said he was spending his spare time exactly as Jesus Christ\ndid.  'You'll find, Davy, old man,' he said, 'if you'll take the\ntrouble to read your Bible, that Jesus traveled with publicans and\nsinners--and a publican is in plain English a saloonkeeper.'\"\n\n\"That was very original--wasn't it?\" said Jane.  \"I'm interested in\nthis man.  He's--different.  I like people who are different.\"\n\n\"I don't think you'd like him, Victor Dorn,\" said David.\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--in a way.  I admire him,\" graciously.  \"He's really a\nremarkable fellow, considering his opportunities.\"\n\n\"He calls you 'Davy, old man,'\" suggested Jane.\n\nHull flushed.  \"That's his way.  He's free and easy with every one.  He\nthinks conventionality is a joke.\"\n\n\"And it is,\" cried Miss Hastings.\n\n\"You'd not think so,\" laughed Hull, \"if he called you Jane or Jenny or\nmy dear Jenny half an hour after he met you.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't,\" said Miss Hastings in a peculiar tone.\n\n\"He would if he felt like it,\" replied Hull.  \"And if you resented it,\nhe'd laugh at you and walk away.  I suspect him of being a good deal of\na poseur and a fakir.  All those revolutionary chaps are.  But I\nhonestly think that he really doesn't care a rap for classes--or for\nmoney--or for any of the substantial things.\"\n\n\"He sounds common,\" said Miss Hastings.  \"I've lost interest in him.\"\nThen in the same breath:  \"How does he live?  Is he a carpenter?\"\n\n\"He was--for several years.  You see, he and his mother together\nbrought up the Dorn family after the father was killed.  They didn't\nget a cent of damages from the railroad.  It was an outrage----\"\n\n\"But my father was the largest owner of the railroad.\"\n\nHull colored violently.  \"You don't understand about business, Jen.\nThe railroad is a corporation.  It fought the case--and the Dorns had\nno money--and the railway owned the judge and bribed several jurors at\neach trial.  Dorn says that was what started him to thinking--to being\na revolutionist--though he doesn't call himself that.\"\n\n\"I should think it would!\" cried Miss Hastings.  \"If my father had\nknown----\"  She caught her breath.  \"But he MUST have known!  He was on\nthe train that day.\"\n\n\"You don't understand business, Jen.  Your father wouldn't interfere\nwith the management of the corporation .\"\n\n\"He makes money out of it--doesn't he?\"\n\n\"So do we all get money out of corporations that are compelled to do\nall sorts of queer things.  But we can't abolish the system--we've got\nto reform it.  That's why I'm in politics--and want you----\"\n\n\"Something must be done about that,\" interrupted Jane.  \"I shall talk\nto father----\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Jen,\" cried David in alarm, \"don't tell your father\nI'VE been stirring you up.  He's one of the powers in politics in this\nState, and----\"\n\n\"I'll not give you away, Davy,\" said Miss Hastings a little\ncontemptuously.  \"I want to hear more about this Victor Dorn. I'll get\nthat money for him and his mother.  Is he very poor?\"\n\n\"Well--you'd call him poor.  But he says he has plenty.  He runs a\nsmall paper.  I think he makes about twenty-five dollars a week out of\nit--and a little more out of lecturing.  Then--every once in a while he\ngoes back to his trade--to keep his hand in and enjoy the luxury of\nearning honest money, as he puts it.\"\n\n\"How queer!\" exclaimed Miss Hastings.  \"I would like to meet him.  Is\nhe--very ignorant?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no, indeed.  He's worked his way through college--and law\nschool afterward.  Supported the family all the time.\"\n\n\"He must be tremendously clever.\"\n\n\"I've given you an exaggerated idea of him,\" Davy hastened to say.\n\"He's really an ordinary sort of chap.\"\n\n\"I should think he'd get rich,\" said Miss Hastings.  \"Most of the men\nthat do--so far as I've met them--seem ordinary enough.\"\n\n\"He says he could get rich, but that he wouldn't waste time that way.\nBut he's fond of boasting.\"\n\n\"You don't think he could make money--after all he did--going to\ncollege and everything?\"\n\n\"Yes--I guess he could,\" reluctantly admitted Davy.  Then in a burst of\ncandor:  \"Perhaps I'm a little jealous of him.  If _I_ were thrown on\nmy own resources, I'm afraid I'd make a pretty wretched showing.\nBut--don't get an exaggerated idea of him. The things I've told you\nsound romantic and unusual.  If you met him--saw him every day--you'd\nrealize he's not at all--at least, not much--out of the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Miss Hastings shrewdly, \"perhaps I'm getting a better\nidea of him than you who see him so often.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll run across him sometime,\" said Davy, who was bearing up no\nbetter than would the next man under the strain of a woman's interest\nin and excitement about another man.  \"When you do, you'll get enough\nin about five minutes.  You see, he's not a gentleman .\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that I'm wildly crazy about gentlemen--AS gentlemen,\"\nreplied the girl.  \"Very few of the interesting people I've read about\nin history and biography have been gentlemen.\"\n\n\"And very few of them would have been pleasant to associate with,\"\nrejoined Hull.  \"You'll admire Victor as I do.  But you'll feel--as I\ndo--that there's small excuse for a man who has been educated, who has\nassociated with upper class people, turning round and inciting the\nlower classes against everything that's fine and improving.\"\n\nIt was now apparent to the girl that David Hull was irritatedly jealous\nof this queer Victor Dorn--was jealous of her interest in him.  Her\nobvious cue was to fan this flame.  In no other way could she get any\namusement out of Davy's society; for his tendency was to be heavily\nserious--and she wanted no more of the too strenuous love making, yet\nwanted to keep him \"on the string.\"  This jealousy was just the means\nfor her end.  Said she innocently:  \"If it irritates you, Davy, we\nwon't talk about him.\"\n\n\"Not at all--not at all,\" cried Hull.  \"I simply thought you'd be\ngetting tired of hearing so much about a man you'd never known.\"\n\n\"But I feel as if I did know him,\" replied she.  \"Your account of him\nwas so vivid.  I thought of asking you to bring him to call.\"\n\nHull laughed heartily.  \"Victor Dorn--calling!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"He doesn't do that sort of thing.  And if he did, how could I bring\nhim here?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well--in the first place, you are a lady--and he is not in your class.\nOf course, men can associate with each other in politics and business.\nBut the social side of life--that's different.\"\n\n\"But a while ago you were talking about my going in for politics,\" said\nMiss Hastings demurely.\n\n\"Still, you'd not have to meet SOCIALLY queer and rough characters----\"\n\n\"Is Victor Dorn very rough?\"\n\nThe interrupting question was like the bite of a big fly to a sweating\nhorse.  \"I'm getting sick of hearing about him from you,\" cried Hull\nwith the pettishness of the spoiled children of the upper class.\n\n\"In what way is he rough?\" persisted Miss Hastings.  \"If you didn't\nwish to talk about Victor Dorn, why did you bring the subject up?\"\n\n\"Oh--all right,\" cried Hull, restraining himself.  \"Victor isn't\nexactly rough.  He can act like a gentleman--when he happens to want\nto.  But you never can tell what he'll do next.\"\n\n\"You MUST bring him to call!\" exclaimed Miss Hastings.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Hull angrily.\n\n\"But he's the only man I've heard about since I've been home that I've\ntaken the least interest in.\"\n\n\"If he did come, your father would have the servants throw him off the\nplace.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Hiss Hastings haughtily.  \"My father wouldn't insult a\nguest of mine.\"\n\n\"But you don't know, Jen,\" cried David.  \"Why, Victor Dorn attacks your\nfather in the most outrageous way in his miserable little anarchist\npaper--calls him a thief, a briber, a blood-sucker--a--I'd not venture\nto repeat to you the things he says.\"\n\n\"No doubt he got a false impression of father because of that damage\nsuit,\" said Miss Hastings mildly.  \"That was a frightful thing.  I\ncan't be so unjust as to blame him, Davy--can you?\"\n\nHull was silent.\n\n\"And I guess father does have to do a lot of things in the course of\nbusiness----  Don't all the big men--the leaders?\"\n\n\"Yes--unfortunately they do,\" said Hull.  \"That's what gives\nplausibility to the shrieks of demagogues like Victor Dorn--though\nVictor is too well educated not to know better than to stir up the\nignorant classes.\"\n\n\"I wonder why he does it,\" said Miss Hastings, reflectively. \"I must\nask him.  I want to hear what he says to excuse himself.\"  In fact, she\nhad not the faintest interest in the views of this queer unknown; her\nchief reason for saying she had was to enjoy David Hull's jealousy.\n\n\"Before you try to meet Victor,\" said Hull, in a constrained, desperate\nway, \"please speak to your father about it.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall,\" replied the girl.  \"As soon as he comes home this\nafternoon, I'm going to talk to him about that damage suit.  That has\ngot to be straightened out.\"  An expression of resolution, of\ngentleness and justice abruptly transformed her face.  \"You may not\nbelieve it, but I have a conscience.\" Absently, \"A curious sort of a\nconscience--one that might become very troublesome, I'm afraid--in some\ncircumstances.\"\n\nInstantly the fine side of David Hull's nature was to the fore--the\ndominant side, for at the first appeal it always responded.  \"So have\nI, Jen,\" said he.  \"I think our similarity in that respect is what\ndraws me so strongly to you. And it's that that makes me hope I can win\nyou.  Oh, Jen--there's so much to be done in the world--and you and I\ncould have such a splendid happy life doing our share of it.\"\n\nShe was once more looking at him with an encouraging interest. But she\nsaid, gently:  \"Let's not talk about that any more to-day, Davy.\"\n\n\"But you'll think about it?\" urged he.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.  \"Let's be friends--and--and see what happens.\"\n\nHull strolled up to the house with her, but refused to stop for lunch.\nHe pleaded an engagement; but it was one that could--and in other\ncircumstances would--have been broken by telephone. His real reason for\nhurrying away was fear lest Jane should open out on the subject of\nVictor Dorn with her father, and, in her ignorance of the truth as to\nthe situation, should implicate him.\n\nShe found her father already at home and having a bowl of crackers and\nmilk in a shady corner of the west veranda.  He was chewing in the\nmanner of those whose teeth are few and not too secure.  His brows were\nknitted and he looked as if not merely joy but everything except\ndisagreeable sensation had long since fled his life beyond hope of\nreturn--an air not uncommon among the world's successful men.  However,\nat sight of his lovely young daughter his face cleared somewhat and he\nshot at her from under his wildly and savagely narrowed eyebrows a\nglance of admiration and tenderness--a quaint expression for those\ncold, hard features.\n\nEveryone spoke of him behind his back as \"Old Morton Hastings.\"\n\nIn fact, he was barely past sixty, was at an age at which city men of\nthe modern style count themselves young and even entertain--not without\nreason--hope of being desired of women for other than purely practical\nreasons.  He was born on a farm--was born with an aversion to physical\nexertion as profound as was his passion for mental exertion.  We never\nshall know how much of its progress the world owes to the physically\nlazy, mentally tireless men.  Those are they who, to save themselves\nphysical exertion, have devised all manner of schemes and machines to\nsave labor.  And, at bottom, what is progress but man's success in his\neffort to free himself from manual labor--to get everything for himself\nby the labor of other men and animals and of machines? Naturally his\nboyhood of toil on the farm did not lessen Martin Hastings' innate\nhorror of \"real work.\"  He was not twenty when he dropped tools never\nto take them up again.  He was shoeing a horse in the heat of the cool\nside of the barn on a frightful August day.  Suddenly he threw down the\nhammer and said loudly: \"A man that works is a damn fool.  I'll never\nwork again.\"  And he never did.\n\nAs soon as he could get together the money--and it was not long after\nhe set about making others work for him--he bought a buggy, a kind of\nphaeton, and a safe horse.  Thenceforth he never walked a step that\ncould be driven.  The result of thirty-five years of this life, so\nunnatural to an animal that is designed by Nature for walking and is\npunished for not doing so--the result of a lifetime of this folly was a\nbody shrivelled to a lean brown husk, legs incredibly meagre and so\ntottery that they scarcely could bear him about.  His head--large and\nfinely shaped--seemed so out of proportion that he looked at a glance\nsenile.  But no one who had business dealings with him suspected him of\nsenility or any degree of weakness.  He spoke in a thin dry voice,\nshrouded in sardonic humor.\n\n\"I don't care for lunch,\" said Jane, dropping to a chair near the side\nof the table opposite her father.  \"I had breakfast too late.  Besides,\nI've got to look out for my figure.  There's a tendency to fat in our\nfamily.\"\n\nThe old man chuckled.  \"Me, for instance,\" said he.\n\n\"Martha, for instance,\" replied Jane.  Martha was her one\nsister--married and ten years older than she and spaciously matronly.\n\n\"Wasn't that Davy Hull you were talking to, down in the woods?\"\ninquired her father.\n\nJane laughed.  \"You see everything,\" said she.\n\n\"I didn't see much when I saw him,\" said her father.\n\nJane was hugely amused.  Her father watched her laughter--the dazzling\ndisplay of fine teeth--with delighted eyes.  \"You've got mighty good\nteeth, Jenny,\" observed he.  \"Take care of 'em. You'll never know what\nmisery is till you've got no teeth--or next to none.\"  He looked\ndisgustedly into his bowl.  \"Crackers and milk!\" grunted he.  \"No teeth\nand no digestion.  The only pleasure a man of my age can have left is\neating, and I'm cheated out of that.\"\n\n\"So, you wouldn't approve of my marrying Davy?\" said the girl.\n\nHer father grunted--chuckled.  \"I didn't say that.  Does he want to\nmarry you?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" retorted Jane.  \"He's an unattached young man--and\nI, being merely a woman, have got to look out for a husband.\"\n\nMartin looked gloomy.  \"There's no hurry,\" said he.  \"You've been away\nsix years.  Seems to me you might stay at home a while.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd bring him here, popsy I've no intention of leaving you. You\nwere in an awful state, when I came home.  That mustn't ever happen\nagain.  And as you won't live with Martha and Hugo--why, I've got to be\nthe victim.\"\n\n\"Yes--it's up to you, Miss, to take care of me in my declining\nyears....  You can marry Davy--if you want to.  Davy--or anybody.  I\ntrust to your good sense.\"\n\n\"If I don't like him, I can get rid of him,\" said the girl.\n\nHer father smiled indulgently.  \"That's A LEETLE too up-to-date for an\nold man like me,\" observed he.  \"The world's moving fast nowadays.\nIt's got a long ways from where it was when your ma and I were young.\"\n\n\"Do you think Davy Hull will make a career?\" asked Jane.  She had heard\nfrom time to time as much as she cared to hear about the world of a\ngeneration before--of its bareness and discomfort, its primness, its\nrepulsive piety, its ignorance of all that made life bright and\nattractive--how it quite overlooked this life in its agitation about\nthe extremely problematic life to come.  \"I mean a career in politics,\"\nshe explained.\n\nThe old man munched and smacked for full a minute before he said,\n\"Well, he can make a pretty good speech.  Yes--I reckon he could be\ntaken in hand and pushed.  He's got a lot of fool college-bred ideas\nabout reforming things.  But he'd soon drop them, if he got into the\npractical swing.  As soon as he had a taste of success, he'd stop being\nfinicky.  Just now, he's one of those nice, pure chaps who stand off\nand tell how things ought to be done.  But he'd get over that.\"\n\nJane smiled peculiarly--half to herself.  \"Yes--I think he would.  In\nfact, I'm sure he would.\"  She looked at her father. \"Do you think he\namounts to as much as Victor Dorn?\" she asked, innocently.\n\nThe old man dropped a half raised spoonful of milk and crackers into\nthe bowl with a splash.  \"Dorn--he's a scoundrel!\" he exclaimed,\nshaking with passion.  \"I'm going to have that dirty little paper of\nhis stopped and him put out of town.  Impudent puppy!--foul-mouthed\ndemagogue!  I'll SHOW him!\"\n\n\"Why, he doesn't amount to anything, father,\" remonstrated the girl.\n\"He's nothing but a common working man--isn't he?\"\n\n\"That's all he is--the hound!\" replied Martin Hastings.   A look of\ncruelty, of tenacious cruelty, had come into his face. It would have\nstartled a stranger.  But his daughter had often seen it; and it did\nnot disturb her, as it had never appeared for anything that in any way\ntouched her life.  \"I've let him hang on here too long,\" went on the\nold man, to himself rather than to her.  \"First thing I know he'll be\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"If he's worth while I should think you'd hire him,\" remarked Jane\nshrewdly.\n\n\"I wouldn't have such a scoundrel in my employ,\" cried her father.\n\n\"Oh, maybe,\" pursued the daughter, \"maybe you couldn't hire him.\"\n\n\"Of course I could,\" scoffed Hastings.  \"Anybody can be hired.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the girl bluntly.\n\n\"One way or another,\" declared the old man.  \"That Dorn boy isn't worth\nthe price he'd want.\"\n\n\"What price would he want?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"How should I know?\" retorted her father angrily.\n\n\"You've tried to hire him--haven't you?\" persisted she.\n\nThe father concentrated on his crackers and milk.  Presently he said:\n\"What did that fool Hull boy say about Dorn to you?\"\n\n\"He doesn't like him,\" replied Jane.  \"He seems to be jealous of\nhim--and opposed to his political views.\"\n\n\"Dorn's views ain't politics.  They're--theft and murder and\nhighfalutin nonsense,\" said Hastings, not unconscious of his feeble\nanti-climax.\n\n\"All the same, he--or rather, his mother--ought to have got damages\nfrom the railway,\" said the girl.  And there was a sudden and startling\nshift in her expression--to a tenacity as formidable as her father's\nown, but a quiet and secret tenacity.\n\nOld Hastings wiped his mouth and began fussing uncomfortably with a\ncigar.\n\n\"I don't blame him for getting bitter and turning against society,\"\ncontinued she.  \"I'd have done the same thing--and so would you.\"\n\nHastings lit the cigar.  \"They wanted ten thousand dollars,\" he said,\nalmost apologetically.  \"Why, they never saw ten thousand cents they\ncould call their own.\"\n\n\"But they lost their bread-winner, father,\" pleaded the girl. \"And\nthere were young children to bring up and educate.  Oh, I hate to think\nthat--that we had anything to do with such a wrong.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a wrong, Jen--as I used to tell your ma,\" said the old man,\nmuch agitated and shrill of voice.  \"It was just the course of\nbusiness.  The law was with our company.\"\n\nJane said nothing.  She simply gazed steadily at her father.  He\navoided her glance.\n\n\"I don't want to hear no more about it,\" he burst out with abrupt\nviolence.  \"Not another word!\"\n\n\"Father, I want it settled--and settled right,\" said the girl. \"I ask\nit as a favor.  Don't do it as a matter of business, but as a matter of\nsentiment.\"\n\nHe shifted uneasily, debating.  When he spoke he was even more\nexplosive than before.  \"Not a cent!  Not a red!  Give that whelp money\nto run his crazy paper on?  Not your father, while he keeps his mind.\"\n\n\"But--mightn't that quiet him?\" pleaded she.  \"What's the use of having\nwar when you can have peace?  You've always laughed at people who let\ntheir prejudices stand in the way of their interests.  You've always\nlaughed at how silly and stupid and costly enmities and revenges are.\nNow's your chance to illustrate, popsy.\"  And she smiled charmingly at\nhim.\n\nHe was greatly softened by her manner--and by the wisdom of what she\nsaid--a wisdom in which, as in a mirror, he recognized with pleasure\nher strong resemblance to himself.  \"That wouldn't be a bad idea, Jen,\"\nsaid he after reflection, \"IF I could get a guarantee.\"\n\n\"But why not do it generously?\" urged the girl.  \"Generosity inspires\ngenerosity.  You'll make him ashamed of himself.\"\n\nWith a cynical smile on his shrivelled face the old man slowly shook\nhis big head that made him look as top-heavy as a newborn baby.  \"That\nisn't as smart, child, as what you said before. It's in them things\nthat the difference between theory and practice shows.  He'd take the\nmoney and laugh at me.  No, I'll try to get a guarantee.\"  He nodded\nand chuckled.  \"Yes, that was a good idea of yours, Jen.\"\n\n\"But--isn't it just possible that he is a man with--with principles of\na certain kind?\" suggested she.\n\n\"Of course, he THINKS so,\" said Hastings.  \"They all do.  But you don't\nsuppose a man of any sense at all could really care about and respect\nworking class people?--ignorant, ungrateful fools.  _I_ know 'em.\nDidn't I come from among 'em?  Ain't I dealt with 'em all my life?  No,\nthat there guy Dorn's simply trying to get up, and is using them to\nstep up on.  I did the same thing, only I did it in a decent,\nlaw-abiding way.  I didn't want to tear down those that was up.  I\nwanted to go up and join 'em.  And I did.\"\n\nAnd his eyes glistened fondly and proudly as he gazed at his daughter.\nShe represented the climax of his rising--she, the lady born and bred,\nin her beautiful clothes, with her lovely, delicate charms.  Yes, he\nhad indeed \"come up,\" and there before him was the superb tangible\nevidence of it.\n\nJane had the strongest belief in her father's worldly wisdom.  At the\nsame time, from what David Hull said she had got an impression of a\nsomething different from the ordinary human being in this queer Victor\nDorn.  \"You'd better move slowly,\" she said to her father.  \"There's no\nhurry, and you might be mistaken in him.\"\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" asserted her father.  \"There's never any need to\nhurry about giving up money.\"  Then, with one of those uncanny flashes\nof intuition for which he, who was never caught napping, was famous, he\nsaid to her sharply:  \"You keep your hands off, miss.\"\n\nShe was thrown into confusion--and her embarrassment enraged her\nagainst herself.  \"What could _I_ do?\" she retorted with a brave\nattempt at indifference.\n\n\"Well--keep your hands off, miss,\" said the old man.  \"No female\nmeddling in business.  I'll stand for most anything, but not for that.\"\n\nJane was now all eagerness for dropping the subject.  She wished no\nfurther prying of that shrewd mind into her secret thoughts. \"It's\nhardly likely I'd meddle where I know nothing about the circumstances,\"\nsaid she.  \"Will you drive me down to Martha's?\"\n\nThis request was made solely to change the subject, to shift her father\nto his favorite topic for family conversation--his daughter Martha,\nMrs. Hugo Galland, her weakness for fashionable pastimes, her incessant\nhints and naggings at her father about his dowdy dress, his vulgar\nmannerisms of speech and of conduct, especially at table.  Jane had not\nthe remotest intention of letting her father drive her to Mrs.\nGalland's, or anywhere, in the melancholy old phaeton-buggy, behind the\nfat old nag whose coat was as shabby as the coat of the master or as\nthe top and the side curtains of the sorrowful vehicle it drew along at\ncaterpillar pace.\n\nWhen her father was ready to depart for his office in the Hastings\nBlock--the most imposing office building in Remsen City, Jane announced\na change of mind.\n\n\"I'll ride, instead,\" said she.  \"I need the exercise, and the day\nisn't too warm.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Martin Hastings grumpily.  He soon got enough of\nanyone's company, even of his favorite daughter's.  Through years of\nhabit he liked to jog about alone, revolving in his mind his business\naffairs--counting in fancy his big bundles of securities, one by one,\ncalculating their returns past, present and prospective--reviewing the\nvarious enterprises in which he was dominant factor, working out\nschemes for getting more profit here, for paying less wages there, for\ntightening his grip upon this enterprise, for dumping his associates in\nthat, for escaping with all the valuable assets from another.  His\nappearance, as he and his nag dozed along the highroad, was as\ndeceptive as that of a hive of bees on a hot day--no signs of life\nexcept a few sleepy workers crawling languidly in and out at the low,\nbroad crack-door, yet within myriads toiling like mad.\n\nJane went up to dress.  She had brought an Italian maid with her from\nFlorence, and a mass of baggage that had given the station loungers at\nRemsen City something to talk about, when there was a dearth of new\nsubjects, for the rest of their lives.  She had transformed her own\nsuite in the second story of the big old house into an appearance of\nthe quarters of a twentieth century woman of wealth and leisure.  In\nthe sitting room were books in four languages; on the walls were\ntasteful reproductions of her favorite old masters.  The excellence of\nher education was attested not by the books and pictures but by the\nabsence of those fussy, commonplace draperies and bits of bric-a-brac\nwhere--with people of no taste and no imagination furnish their houses\nbecause they can think of nothing else to fill in the gaps.\n\nMany of Jane's ways made Sister Martha uneasy.  For Martha, while\nadmitting that Jane through superior opportunity ought to know, could\nnot believe that the \"right sort\" of people on the other side had\nthrown over all her beloved formalities and were conducting themselves\ndistressingly like tenement-house people. For instance, Martha could\nnot approve Jane's habit of smoking cigarettes--a habit which, by one\nof those curious freaks of character, enormously pleased her father.\nBut--except in one matter--Martha entirely approved Jane's style of\ndress.  She hastened to pronounce it \"just too elegant\" and repeated\nthat phrase until Jane, tried beyond endurance, warned her that the\nword elegant was not used seriously by people of the \"right sort\" and\nthat its use was regarded as one of those small but subtle signs of the\nloathsome \"middle class.\"\n\nThe one thing in Jane's dress that Martha disapproved--or, rather,\nshied at--was her riding suit.  This was an extremely noisy plaid man's\nsuit--for Jane rode astride.  Martha could not deny that Jane looked\n\"simply stunning\" when seated on her horse and dressed in that garb\nwith her long slim feet and graceful calves encased in a pair of riding\nboots that looked as if they must have cost \"something fierce.\"  But\nwas it really \"ladylike\"?  Hadn't Jane made a mistake and adopted a\ncostume worn only by the fashionables among the demi-mondaines of whom\nMartha had read and had heard such dreadful, delightful stories?\n\nIt was the lively plaid that Miss Hastings now clad herself in. She\nloved that suit.  Not only did it give her figure a superb opportunity\nbut also it brought out new beauties in her contour and coloring.  And\nher head was so well shaped and her hair grew so thickly about brow and\nears and nape of neck that it looked full as well plaited and done\nclose as when it was framing her face and half concealing, half\nrevealing her charming ears in waves of changeable auburn.  After a\nlingering--and pardonably pleased--look at herself in a long mirror,\nshe descended, mounted and rode slowly down toward town.\n\nThe old Galland homestead was at the western end of town--in a quarter\nthat had become almost poor.  But it was so dignified and its grounds\nwere so extensive that it suggested a manor house with the humble homes\nof the lord's dependents clustering about it for shelter.  To reach it\nJane had to ride through two filthy streets lined with factories.  As\nshe rode she glanced at the windows, where could be seen in dusty air\ngirls and boys busy at furiously driven machines--machines that\ncompelled their human slaves to strain every nerve in the monotonous\ntask of keeping them occupied.  Many of the girls and boys paused long\nenough for a glance at the figure of the man-clad girl on the big horse.\n\nJane, happy in the pleasant sunshine, in her beauty and health and fine\nraiment and secure and luxurious position in the world, gave a thought\nof pity to these imprisoned young people.  \"How lucky I am,\" she\nthought, \"not to have been born like that.  Of course, we all have our\nfalls now and then.  But while they always strike on the hard ground,\nI've got a feather bed to fall on.\"\n\nWhen she reached Martha's and was ushered into the cool upstairs\nsitting room, in somehow ghastly contrast to the hot rooms where the\nyoung working people sweated and strained, the subject persisted in its\nhold on her thoughts.  There was Martha, in comfortable, corsetless\nexpansiveness--an ideal illustration of the worthless idler fattening\nin purposelessness.  She was engaged with all her energies in preparing\nfor the ball Hugo Galland's sister, Mrs. Bertrand, was giving at the\nassembly rooms that night.\n\n\"I've been hard at it for several days now,\" said she.  \"I think at\nlast I see daylight.  But I want your opinion.\"\n\nJane gazed absently at the dress and accompanying articles that had\nbeen assembled with so much labor.  \"All right,\" said she. \"You'll look\nfine and dandy.\"\n\nMartha twitched.  \"Jane, dear--don't say that--don't use such an\nexpression.  I know it's your way of joking.  But lots of people would\nthink you didn't know any better.\"\n\n\"Let 'em think,\" said Jane.  \"I say and do as I please.\"\n\nMartha sighed.  Here was one member of her family who could be a\ncredit, who could make people forget the unquestionably common origin\nof the Hastingses and of the Morleys.  Yet this member was always\nbreaking out into something mortifying, something reminiscent of the\nfarm and of the livery stable--for the deceased Mrs. Hastings had been\ndaughter of a livery stable keeper--in fact, had caught Martin Hastings\nby the way she rode her father's horses at a sale at a county fair.\nSaid Martha:\n\n\"You haven't really looked at my clothes, Jane.  Why DID you go back to\ncalling yourself Jane?\"\n\n\"Because it's my name,\" replied her sister.\n\n\"I know that.  But you hated it and changed it to Jeanne, which is so\nmuch prettier.\"\n\n\"I don't think so any more,\" replied Miss Hastings.  \"My taste has\nimproved.  Don't be so horribly middle class, Martha--ashamed of\neverything simple and natural.\"\n\n\"You think you know it all--don't you?--just because you've lived\nabroad,\" said Martha peevishly.\n\n\"On the contrary, I don't know one-tenth as much as I thought I did,\nwhen I came back from Wellesley with a diploma.\"\n\n\"Do you like my costume?\" inquired Martha, eying her finery with the\nfond yet dubious expression of the woman who likes her own taste but is\nnot sure about its being good taste.\n\n\"What a lazy, worthless pair we are!\" exclaimed Jane, hitting her boot\nleg a tremendous rap with her little cane.\n\nMartha startled.  \"Good God--Jane--what is it?\" she cried.\n\n\"On the way here I passed a lot of factories,\" pursued Jane. \"Why\nshould those people have to work like--like the devil, while we sit\nabout planning ball dresses?\"\n\nMartha settled back comfortably.  \"I feel so sorry for those poor\npeople,\" said she, absently sympathetic.\n\n\"But why?\" demanded Jane.  \"WHY?  Why should we be allowed to idle\nwhile they have to slave?  What have we done--what are we doing--to\nentitle us to ease?  What have they done to condemn them to pain and\ntoil?\"\n\n\"You know very well, Jane, that we represent the finer side of life.\"\n\n\"Slop!\" ejaculated Jane.\n\n\"For pity's sake, don't let's talk politics,\" wailed Martha. \"I know\nnothing about politics.  I haven't any brains for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Is that politics?\" inquired Jane.  \"I thought politics meant whether\nthe Democrats or the Republicans or the reformers were to get the\noffices and the chance to steal.\"\n\n\"Everything's politics, nowadays,\" said Martha, comparing the color of\nthe material of her dress with the color of her fat white arm.  \"As\nHugo says, that Victor Dorn is dragging everything into politics--even\nour private business of how we make and spend our own money.\"\n\nJane sat down abruptly.  \"Victor Dorn,\" she said in a strange voice.\n\"WHO is Victor Dorn?  WHAT is Victor Dorn?  It seems that I can hear of\nnothing but Victor Dorn to-day.\"\n\n\"He's too low to talk about,\" said Martha, amiable and absent.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Politics,\" replied Martha.  \"Really, he is horrid, Jane.\"\n\n\"To look at?\"\n\n\"No--not to look at.  He's handsome in a way.  Not at all common\nlooking.  You might take him for a gentleman, if you didn't know.\nStill--he always dresses peculiarly--always wears soft hats.  I think\nsoft hats are SO vulgar--don't you?\"\n\n\"How hopelessly middle-class you are, Martha,\" mocked Jane.\n\n\"Hugo would as soon think of going in the street in a--in a--I don't\nknow what.\"\n\n\"Hugo is the finest flower of American gentleman.  That is, he's the\nquintessence of everything that's nice--and 'nasty.'  I wish I were\nmarried to him for a week.  I love Hugo, but he gives me the creeps.\"\nShe rose and tramped restlessly about the room. \"You both give me the\ncreeps.  Everything conventional gives me the creeps.  If I'm not\ncareful I'll dress myself in a long shirt, let down my hair and run\nwild.\"\n\n\"What nonsense you do talk,\" said Martha composedly.\n\nJane sat down abruptly.  \"So I do!\" she said.  \"I'm as poor a creature\nas you at bottom.  I simply like to beat against the bars of my cage to\nmake myself think I'm a wild, free bird by nature.  If you opened the\ndoor, I'd not fly out, but would hop meekly back to my perch and fall\nto smoothing my feathers.... Tell me some more about Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"I told you he isn't fit to talk about,\" said Martha.  \"Do you know,\nthey say now that he is carrying on with that shameless, brazen thing\nwho writes for his paper, that Selma Gordon?\"\n\n\"Selma Gordon,\" echoed Jane.  Her brows came down in a gesture\nreminiscent of her father, and there was a disagreeable expression\nabout her mouth and in her light brown eyes.  \"Who's Selma Gordon?\"\n\n\"She makes speeches--and writes articles against rich people--and--oh,\nshe's horrid.\"\n\n\"Pretty?\"\n\n\"No--a scrawny, black thing.  The men--some of them--say she's got a\nkind of uncanny fascination.  Some even insist that she's beautiful.\"\nMartha laughed.  \"Beautiful!  How could a woman with black hair and a\ndark skin and no flesh on her bones be beautiful?\"\n\n\"It has been known to happen,\" said Jane curtly.  \"Is she one of THE\nGordons?\"\n\n\"Mercy, no!\" cried Martha Galland.  \"She simply took the name of\nGordon--that is, her father did.  He was a Russian peasant--a Jew.  And\nhe fell in love with a girl who was of noble family--a princess, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Princess doesn't mean much in Russia,\" said Jane sourly.\n\n\"Anyhow, they ran away to this country.  And he worked in the rolling\nmill here--and they both died--and Selma became a factory girl--and\nthen took to writing for the New Day--that's Victor Dorn's paper, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"How romantic,\" said Jane sarcastically.  \"And now Victor Dorn's in\nlove with her?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" replied Martha, with a scandal-smile.\n\nJane Hastings went to the window and gazed out into the garden. Martha\nresumed her habitual warm day existence--sat rocking gently and fanning\nherself and looking leisurely about the room. Presently she said:\n\n\"Jane, why don't you marry Davy Hull?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"He's got an independent income--so there's no question of his marrying\nfor money.  And there isn't any family anywhere that's better than\nhis--mighty few as good.  And he's DEAD in love with you, Jen.\"\n\nWith her back still turned Jane snapped, \"I'd rather marry Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"What OUTRAGEOUS things you do say!\" cried Martha.\n\n\"I envy that black Jewess--that--what's her name?--that Selma Gordon.\"\n\n\"You don't even know them,\" said Martha.\n\nJane wheeled round with a strange laugh.  \"Don't I?\" cried she.\n\n\"I don't know anyone else.\"\n\nShe strode to her sister and tapped her lightly on the shoulder with\nthe riding stick.\n\n\"Be careful,\" cautioned Martha.  \"You know how easily my flesh\nmars--and I'm going to wear my low neck to-night.\"\n\nJane did not heed.  \"David Hull is a bore--and a fraud,\" she said.  \"I\ntell you I'd rather marry Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"Do be careful about my skin, dear,\" pleaded Martha.  \"Hugo'll be SO\nput out if there's a mark on it.  He's very proud of my skin.\"\n\nJane looked at her quizzically.  \"What a dear, fat old rotter of a\nrespectability it is, to be sure,\" said she--and strode from the room,\nand from the house.\n\nHer mood of perversity and defiance did not yield to a ten mile gallop\nover the gentle hills of that lovely part of Indiana, but held on\nthrough the afternoon and controlled her toilet for the ball.  She knew\nthat every girl in town would appear at that most fashionable party of\nthe summer season in the best clothing she could get together.  As she\nhad several dresses from Paris which she not without reason regarded as\nnotable works of art, the opportunity to outshine was hers--the sort of\nopportunity she took pleasure in using to the uttermost, as a rule.\nBut to be the best dressed woman at Mrs. Bertram's party was too easy\nand too commonplace.  To be the worst dressed would call for\ncourage--of just the sort she prided herself on having.  Also, it would\nlook original, would cause talk--would give her the coveted sense of\nachievement.\n\nWhen she descended to show herself to her father and say good night to\nhim, she was certainly dressed by the same pattern that caused him to\nbe talked about throughout that region.  Her gown was mussed, had been\nmended obviously in several places, had not been in its best day\nbecoming.  But this was not all.  Her hair looked stringy and\ndishevelled.  She was delighted with herself. Except during an illness\ntwo years before never had she come so near to being downright homely.\n\"Martha will die of shame,\" said she to herself.  \"And Mrs. Bertram\nwill spend the evening explaining me to everybody.\"  She did not\ndefinitely formulate the thought, \"And I shall be the most talked about\nperson of the evening\"; but it was in her mind none the less.\n\nHer father always smoked his after-dinner cigar in a little room just\noff the library.  It was filled up with the plain cheap furniture and\nthe chromos and mottoes which he and his wife had bought when they\nfirst went to housekeeping--in their early days of poverty and\nstruggle.  On the south wall was a crude and cheap, but startlingly\nlarge enlargement of an old daguerreotype of Letitia Hastings at\ntwenty-four--the year after her marriage and the year before the birth\nof the oldest child, Robert, called Dock, now piling up a fortune as an\ninsider in the Chicago \"brave\" game of wheat and pork, which it is\nabsurd to call gambling because gambling involves chance.  To smoke the\none cigar the doctor allowed him, old Martin Hastings always seated\nhimself before this picture.  He found it and his thoughts the best\ncompany in the world, just as he had found her silent self and her\nthoughts the best company in their twenty-one years of married life.\nAs he sat there, sometimes he thought of her--of what they had been\nthrough together, of the various advances in his fortune--how this one\nhad been made near such and such anniversary, and that one between two\nother anniversaries--and what he had said to her and what she had said\nto him. Again--perhaps oftener--he did not think of her directly, any\nmore than he had thought of her when they sat together evening after\nevening, year in and year out, through those twenty-one years of\ncontented and prosperous life.\n\nAs Jane entered he, seated back to the door, said:\n\n\"About that there Dorn damage suit----\"\n\nJane started, caught her breath.  Really, it was uncanny, this\ncontinual thrusting of Victor Dorn at her.\n\n\"It wasn't so bad as it looked,\" continued her father.  He was speaking\nin the quiet voice--quiet and old and sad--he always used when seated\nbefore the picture.\n\n\"You see, Jenny, in them days\"--also, in presence of the picture he\nlapsed completely into the dialect of his youth--\"in them days the\nrailroad was teetering and I couldn't tell which way things'd jump.\nEvery cent counted.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly, father,\" said Jane, her hands on his shoulders\nfrom behind.  She felt immensely relieved.  She did not realize that\nevery doer of a mean act always has an excellent excuse for it.\n\n\"Then afterwards,\" the old man went on, \"the family was getting along\nso well--the boy was working steady and making good money and pushing\nahead--and I was afeared I'd do harm instead of good.  It's mighty\ndangerous, Jen, to give money sudden to folks that ain't used to it.\nI've seen many a smash-up come that way. And your ma--she thought so,\ntoo--kind of.\"\n\nThe \"kind of\" was advanced hesitatingly, with an apologetic side glance\nat the big crayon portrait.  But Jane was entirely convinced.  She was\naverage human; therefore, she believed what she wished to believe.\n\n\"You were quite right, father,\" said she.  \"I knew you couldn't do a\nbad thing--wouldn't deliberately strike at weak, helpless people.  And\nnow, it can be straightened out and the Dorns will be all the better\nfor not having been tempted in the days when it might have ruined them.\"\n\nShe had walked round where her father could see her, as she delivered\nherself of this speech so redolent of the fumes of collegiate smugness.\nHe proceeded to examine her--with an expression of growing\ndissatisfaction.  Said he fretfully:\n\n\"You don't calculate to go out, looking like that?\"\n\n\"Out to the swellest blow-out of the year, popsy,\" said she.\n\nThe big heavy looking head wobbled about uneasily.  \"You look too much\nlike your old pappy's daughter,\" said he.\n\n\"I can afford to,\" replied she.\n\nThe head shook positively.  \"You ma wouldn't 'a liked it.  She was\nmighty partic'lar how she dressed.\"\n\nJane laughed gayly.  \"Why, when did you become a critic of women's\ndress?\" cried she.\n\n\"I always used to buy yer ma dresses and hats when I went to the city,\"\nsaid he.  \"And she looked as good as the best--not for these days, but\nfor them times.\"  He looked critically at the portrait.  \"I bought them\nclothes and awful dear they seemed to me.\"  His glance returned to his\ndaughter.  \"Go get yourself up proper,\" said he, between request and\ncommand.  \"SHE wouldn't 'a liked it.\"\n\nJane gazed at the common old crayon, suddenly flung her arms round the\nold man's neck.  \"Yes--father,\" she murmured.  \"To please HER.\"\n\nShe fled; the old man wiped his eyes, blew his nose and resumed the\ncareful smoking of the cheap, smelly cigar.  He said he preferred that\nbrand of his days of poverty; and it was probably true, as he would\nrefuse better cigars offered him by fastidious men who hoped to save\nthemselves from the horrors of his.  He waited restlessly, though it\nwas long past his bedtime; he yawned and pretended to listen while Davy\nHull, who had called for Jane in the Hull brougham, tried to make a\nfavorable impression upon him.  At last Jane reappeared--and certainly\nLetitia Hastings would have been more than satisfied.\n\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" said she to Hull, who was speechless and\ntremulous before her voluptuous radiance.  \"But father didn't like the\nway I was rigged out.  Maybe I'll have to change again.\"\n\n\"Take her along, Davy,\" said Hastings, his big head wagging with\ndelight.  \"She's a caution--SHE is!\"\n\nHull could not control himself to speak.  As they sat in the carriage,\nshe finishing the pulling on of her gloves, he stared out into the\nheavy rain that was deluging the earth and bending low the boughs.\nSaid she, half way down the hill:\n\n\"Well--can't you talk about anything but Victor Dorn?\"\n\n\"I saw him this afternoon,\" said Hull, glad that the tension of the\nsilence was broken.\n\n\"Then you've got something to talk about.\"\n\n\"The big street car strike is on.\"\n\n\"So father said at dinner.  I suppose Victor Dorn caused it.\"\n\n\"No--he's opposed to it.  He's queer.  I don't exactly understand his\nideas.  He says strikes are ridiculous--that it's like trying to cure\nsmallpox by healing up one single sore.\"\n\nJane gave a shiver of lady-like disgust.  \"How--nasty,\" said she.\n\n\"I'm telling you what he said.  But he says that the only way human\nbeings learn how to do things right is by doing them wrong--so while\nhe's opposed to strikes he's also in favor of them.\"\n\n\"Even _I_ understand that,\" said Jane.  \"I don't think it's difficult.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it strike you as--as inconsistent?\"\n\n\"Oh--bother consistency!\" scoffed the girl.  \"That's another middle\nclass virtue that sensible people loathe as a vice. Anyhow, he's\nhelping the strikers all he can--and fighting US. You know, your father\nand my father's estate are the two biggest owners of the street\nrailways.\"\n\n\"I must get his paper,\" said Jane.  \"I'll have a lot of fun reading the\ntruth about us.\"\n\nBut David wasn't listening.  He was deep in thought.  After a while he\nsaid:  \"It's amazing--and splendid--and terrible, what power he's\ngetting in our town.  Victor Dorn, I mean.\"\n\n\"Always Victor Dorn,\" mocked Jane.\n\n\"When he started--twelve years ago as a boy of twenty, just out of\ncollege and working as a carpenter--when he started, he was alone and\npoor, and without friends or anything.  He built up little by little,\nwinning one man at a time--the fellow working next him on his right,\nthen the chap working on his left--in the shop--and so on, one man\nafter another.  And whenever he got a man he held him--made him as\ndevoted--as--as fanatical as he is himself.  Now he's got a band of\nnearly a thousand.  There are ten thousand voters in this town.  So,\nhe's got only one in ten. But what a thousand!\"\n\nJane was gazing out into the rain, her eyes bright, her lips parted.\n\n\"Are you listening?\" asked Hull.  \"Or, am I boring you?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said she.\n\n\"They're a thousand missionaries--apostles--yes, apostle is the name\nfor them.  They live and breathe and think and talk only the ideas\nVictor Dorn believes and fights for.  And whenever he wants anything\ndone--anything for the cause--why, there are a thousand men ready to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Jane.\n\n\"Victor Dorn,\" said Hull.  \"Do you wonder that he interests me?  For\ninstance, to-night: you see how it's raining.  Well, Victor Dorn had\nthem print to-day fifty thousand leaflets about this strike--what it\nmeans to his cause.  And he has asked five hundred of his men to stand\non the corners and patrol the streets and distribute those dodgers.\nI'll bet not a man will be missing.\"\n\n\"But why?\" repeated Jane.  \"What for?\"\n\n\"He wants to conquer this town.  He says the world has to be\nconquered--and that the way to begin is to begin--and that he has\nbegun.\"\n\n\"Conquer it for what?\"\n\n\"For himself, I guess,\" said Hull.  \"Of course, he professes that it's\nfor the public good.  They all do.  But what's the truth?\"\n\n\"If I saw him I could tell you,\" said Jane in the full pride of her\nbelief in her woman's power of divination in character.\n\n\"However, he can't succeed,\" observed Hull.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he can,\" replied Jane.  \"And will.  Even if every idea he had\nwere foolish and wrong.  And it isn't--is it?\"\n\nDavid laughed peculiarly.  \"He's infernally uncomfortably right in most\nof the things he charges and proposes.  I don't like to think about\nit.\"  He shut his teeth together.  \"I WON'T think about it,\" he\nmuttered.\n\n\"No--you'd better stick to your own road, Davy,\" said Jane with\nirritating mockery.  \"You were born to be thoroughly conventional and\nrespectable.  As a reformer you're ideal.  As a--an imitator of Victor\nDorn, you'd be a joke.\"\n\n\"There's one of his men now,\" exclaimed Hull, leaning forward excitedly.\n\nJane looked.  A working man, a commonplace enough object, was standing\nunder the corner street lamp, the water running off his hat, his\nshoulders, his coat tail.  His package of dodgers was carefully\nshielded by an oilcloth from the wet which had full swing at the man.\nTo every passer-by he presented a dodger, accompanying the polite\ngesture with some phrase which seemed to move the man or woman to take\nwhat was offered and to put it away instead of dropping it.\n\nJane sank back in the carriage, disappointed.  \"Is that all?\" said she\ndisdainfully.\n\n\"ALL?\" cried Hull.  \"Use your imagination, Jen.  But I forgot--you're a\nwoman.  They see only surfaces.\"\n\n\"And are snared into marrying by complexions and pretty features and\ndresses and silly flirting tricks,\" retorted the girl sarcastically.\n\nHull laughed.  \"I spoke too quick that time,\" said he.  \"I suppose you\nexpected to see something out of a fifteenth century Italian old\nmaster!  Well--it was there, all right.\"\n\nJane shrugged her shoulders.  \"And your Victor Dorn,\" said she, \"no\ndoubt he's seated in some dry, comfortable place enjoying the thought\nof his men making fools of themselves for him.\"\n\nThey were drawing up to the curb before the Opera House where were the\nassembly rooms.  \"There he is now,\" cried Hull.\n\nJane, startled, leaned eagerly forward.  In the rain beyond the edge of\nthe awning stood a dripping figure not unlike that other which had so\ndisappointed her.  Underneath the brim of the hat she could see a\nsmooth-shaven youngish face--almost boyish.  But the rain streaming\nfrom the brim made satisfactory scrutiny impossible.\n\nJane again sank back.  \"How many carriages before us?\" she said.\n\n\"You're disappointed in him, too, I suppose,\" said Hull.  \"I knew you\nwould be.\"\n\n\"I thought he was tall,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Only middling,\" replied Hull, curiously delighted.\n\n\"I thought he was serious,\" said Jane.\n\n\"On the contrary, he's always laughing.  He's the best natured man I\nknow.\"\n\nAs they descended and started along the carpet under the middle of the\nawning, Jane halted.  She glanced toward the dripping figure whom the\npolice would not permit under the shelter.  Said she:  \"I want one of\nthose papers.\"\n\nDavy moved toward the drenched distributor of strike literature. \"Give\nme one, Dorn,\" he said in his most elegant manner.\n\n\"Sure, Davy,\" said Dorn in a tone that was a subtle commentary on\nHull's aristocratic tone and manner.  As he spoke he glanced at Jane;\nshe was looking at him.  Both smiled--at Davy's expense.\n\nDavy and Jane passed on in, Jane folding the dodger to tuck it away for\nfuture reading.  She said to him:  \"But you didn't tell me about his\neyes.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with them?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" replied she--and said no more.\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe dance was even more tiresome than Jane had anticipated. There had\nbeen little pleasure in outshining the easily outshone belles of Remsen\nCity.  She had felt humiliated by having to divide the honors with a\nbrilliantly beautiful and scandalously audacious Chicago girl, a Yvonne\nHereford--whose style, in looks, in dress and in wit, was more\ncomfortable to the standard of the best young men of Remsen City--a\nstandard which Miss Hastings, cultivated by foreign travel and social\nadventure, regarded as distinctly poor, not to say low.  Miss\nHereford's audacities were especially offensive to Jane.  Jane was\naudacious herself, but she flattered herself that she had a delicate\nsense of that baffling distinction between the audacity that is the\nhall mark of the lady and the audacity that proclaims the not-lady.\nFor example, in such apparently trifling matters as the way of smoking\na cigarette, the way of crossing the legs or putting the elbows on the\ntable or using slang, Jane found a difference, abysmal though narrow,\nbetween herself and Yvonne Hereford. \"But then, her very name gives her\naway,\" reflected Jane. \"There'd surely be a frightfully cheap streak in\na mother who in this country would name her daughter Yvonne--or in a\ngirl who would name herself that.\"\n\nHowever, Jane Hastings was not deeply annoyed either by the\nshortcomings of Remsen City young men or by the rivalry of Miss\nHereford.  Her dissatisfaction was personal--the feeling of futility,\nof cheapness, in having dressed herself in her best and spent a whole\nevening at such unworthy business.  \"Whatever I am or am not fit for,\"\nsaid she to herself, \"I'm not for society--any kind of society.  At\nleast I'm too much grown-up mentally for that.\"  Her disdainful\nthoughts about others were, on this occasion as almost always, merely a\nmode of expressing her self-scorn.\n\nAs she was undressing she found in her party bag the dodger Hull had\ngot for her from Victor Dorn.  She, sitting at her dressing table,\nstarted to read it at once.  But her attention soon wandered.  \"I'm not\nin the mood,\" she said.  \"To-morrow.\" And she tossed it into the top\ndrawer.  The fact was, the subject of politics interested her only when\nsome man in whom she was interested was talking it to her.  In a\ngeneral way she understood things political, but like almost all women\nand all but a few men she could fasten her attention only on things\ndirectly and clearly and nearly related to her own interests. Politics\nseemed to her to be not at all related to her--or, indeed, to anybody\nbut the men running for office.  This dodger was politics, pure and\nsimple.  A plea to workingmen to awaken to the fact that their STRIKES\nwere stupid and wasteful, that the way to get better pay and decent\nhours of labor was by uniting, taking possession of the power that was\nrightfully theirs and regulating their own affairs.\n\nShe resumed fixing her hair for the night.  Her glance bent steadily\ndownward at one stage of this performance, rested unseeingly upon the\nhandbill folded printed side out and on top of the contents of the open\ndrawer.  She happened to see two capital letters--S.G.--in a line by\nthemselves at the end of the print.  She repeated them mechanically\nseveral times--\"S.G.--S.G.--S.G.\"--then her hands fell from her hair\nupon the handbill.  She settled herself to read in earnest.\n\n\"Selma Gordon,\" she said.  \"That's different.\"\n\nShe would have had some difficulty in explaining to herself why it was\n\"different.\"  She read closely, concentratedly now.  She tried to read\nin an attitude of unfriendly criticism, but she could not.  A dozen\nlines, and the clear, earnest, honest sentences had taken hold of her.\nHow sensible the statements were, and how obviously true.  Why, it\nwasn't the writing of an \"anarchistic crank\" at all--on the contrary,\nthe writer was if anything more excusing toward the men who were giving\nthe drivers and motormen a dollar and ten cents a day for fourteen\nhours' work--\"fourteen hours!\" cried Jane, her cheeks burning--yes,\nSelma Gordon was more tolerant of the owners of the street car line\nthan Jane herself would have been.\n\nWhen Jane had read, she gazed at the print with sad envy in her eyes.\n\"Selma Gordon can think--and she can write, too,\" said she half aloud.\n\"I want to know her--too.\"\n\nThat \"too\" was the first admission to herself of a curiously intense\ndesire to meet Victor Dorn.\n\n\"Oh, to be in earnest about something!  To have a real interest! To\nfind something to do besides the nursery games disguised under new\nforms for the grown-up yet never to be grown-up infants of the world.\nAnd THAT kind of politics doesn't sound shallow and dull.  There's\nheart in it--and brains--real brains--not merely nasty little\nself-seeking cunning.\"  She took up the handbill again and read a\nparagraph set in bolder type:\n\n\"The reason we of the working class are slaves is because we haven't\nintelligence enough to be our own masters, let alone masters of anybody\nelse.  The talk of equality, workingmen, is nonsense to flatter your\nsilly, ignorant vanity.  We are not the equals of our masters.  They\nknow more than we do, and naturally they use that knowledge to make us\nwork for them.  So, even if you win in this strike or in all your\nstrikes, you will not much better yourselves.  Because you are ignorant\nand foolish, your masters will scheme around and take from you in some\nother way what you have wrenched from them in the strike.\n\n\"Organize!  Think!  Learn!  Then you will rise out of the dirt where\nyou wallow with your wives and your children.  Don't blame your\nmasters; they don't enslave you.  They don't keep you in slavery.  Your\nchains  are of your own forging and only you can strike them off!\"\n\nCertainly no tenement house woman could be lazier, emptier of head,\nmore inane of life than her sister Martha.  \"She wouldn't even keep\nclean if it wasn't the easiest thing in the world for her to do, and a\nhelp at filling in her long idle day.\" Yet--Martha Galland had every\ncomfort and most of the luxuries, was as sheltered from all the\nhardships as a hot-house flower. Then there was Hugo--to go no further\nafield than the family. Had he ever done an honest hour's work in his\nlife?  Could anyone have less brains than he?  Yet Hugo was rich and\nrespected, was a director in big corporations, was a member of a\nfirst-class law firm.  \"It isn't fair,\" thought the girl.  \"I've always\nfelt it.  I see now why.  It's a bad system of taking from the many for\nthe benefit of us few.  And it's kept going by a few clever, strong men\nlike father.  They work for themselves and their families and relatives\nand for their class--and the rest of the people have to suffer.\"\n\nShe did not fall asleep for several hours, such was the tumult in her\naroused brain.  The first thing the next morning she went down town,\nbought copies of the New Day--for that week and for a few preceding\nweeks--and retreated to her favorite nook in her father's grounds to\nread and to think--and to plan.  She searched the New Day in vain for\nany of the wild, wandering things Davy and her father had told her\nVictor Dorn was putting forth.  The four pages of each number were\ngiven over either to philosophical articles no more \"anarchistic\" than\nEmerson's essays, not so much so as Carlyle's, or to plain accounts of\nthe current stealing by the politicians of Remsen City, of the squalor\nand disease--danger in the tenements, of the outrages by the gas and\nwater and street car companies.  There was much that was terrible, much\nthat was sad, much that was calculated to make an honest heart burn\nwith indignation against those who were cheerily sacrificing the whole\ncommunity to their desire for profits and dividends and graft, public\nand private.  But there was also a great deal of humor--of rather a\nsardonic kind, but still seeing the fantastic side of this grand game\nof swindle.\n\nTwo paragraphs made an especial impression on her:\n\n\"Remsen City is no worse--and no better--than other American cities.\nIt's typical.  But we who live here needn't worry about the rest of the\ncountry.  The thing for us to do is to CLEAN UP AT HOME.\"\n\n\"We are more careful than any paper in this town about verifying every\nstatement we make, before we make it.  If we should publish a single\nstatement about anyone that was false even in part we would be\nsuppressed.  The judges, the bosses, the owners of the big\nblood-sucking public service corporations, the whole ruling class, are\neager to put us out of existence.  Don't forget this fact when you hear\nthe New Day called a lying, demagogical sheet.\"\n\nWith the paper beside her on the rustic bench, she fell to\ndreaming--not of a brighter and better world, of a wiser and freer\nrace, but of Victor Dorn, the personality that had unaided become such\na power in Remsen City, the personality that sparkled and glowed in the\ninteresting pages of the New Day, that made its sentences read as if\nthey were spoken into your very ears by an earnest, honest voice\nissuing from a fascinating, humor-loving, intensely human and natural\nperson before your very eyes.  But it was not round Victor Dorn's brain\nthat her imagination played.\n\n\"After all,\" thought she, \"Napoleon wasn't much over five feet.  Most\nof the big men have been little men.  Of course, there were\nAlexander--and Washington--and Lincoln, but--how silly to bother about\na few inches of height, more or less!  And he wasn't really SHORT.  Let\nme see--how high did he come on Davy when Davy was standing near him?\nAbove his shoulder--and Davy's six feet two or three.  He's at least as\ntall as I am--anyhow, in my ordinary heels.\"\n\nShe was attracted by both the personalities she discovered in the\nlittle journal.  She believed she could tell them apart.  About some of\nthe articles, the shorter ones, she was doubtful.  But in those of any\nlength she could feel that difference which enables one to distinguish\nthe piano touch of a player in another room--whether it is male or\nfemale.  Presently she was searching for an excuse for scraping\nacquaintance with this pair of pariahs--pariahs so far as her world was\nconcerned.  And soon she found it.  The New Day was taking\nsubscriptions for a fund to send sick children and their mothers to the\ncountry for a vacation from the dirt and heat of the tenements--for\nRemsen City, proud though it was and boastful of its prosperity, housed\nmost of its inhabitants in slums--though of course that low sort of\npeople oughtn't really to be counted--except for purposes of swelling\ncensus figures--and to do all the rough and dirty work necessary to\nkeep civilization going.\n\nShe would subscribe to this worthy charity--and would take her\nsubscription, herself.  Settled--easily and well settled.  She did not\ninvolve herself, or commit herself in any way.  Besides, those who\nmight find out and might think she had overstepped the bounds would\nexcuse her on the ground that she had not been back at home long and\ndid not realize what she was doing.\n\nWhat should she wear?\n\nHer instinct was for an elaborate toilet--a descent in state--or such\nstate as the extremely limited resources of Martin Hastings' stables\nwould permit.  The traps he had ordered for her had not yet come; she\nhad been glad to accept David Hull's offer of a lift the night before.\nStill, without a carriage or a motor she could make quite an impression\nwith a Paris walking dress and hat, properly supported by fashionable\naccessories of the toilet.\n\nGood sense and good taste forbade these promptings of nature. No, she\nwould dress most simply--in her very plainest things--taking care to\nmaintain all her advantages of face and figure.  If she overwhelmed\nDorn and Miss Gordon, she would defeat her own purpose--would not\nbecome acquainted with them.\n\nIn the end she rejected both courses and decided for the riding\ncostume.  The reason she gave for this decision--the reason she gave\nherself--was that the riding costume would invest the call with an air\nof accident, of impulse.  The real reason.\n\nIt may be that some feminine reader can guess why she chose the most\nstartling, the most gracefully becoming, the most artlessly physical\napparel in her wardrobe.\n\nShe said nothing to her father at lunch about her plans.  Why should\nshe speak of them?  He might oppose; also, she might change her mind.\nAfter lunch she set out on her usual ride, galloping away into the\nhills--but she had put twenty-five dollars in bills in her trousers\npocket.  She rode until she felt that her color was at its best, and\nthen she made for town--a swift, direct ride, her heart beating high as\nif she were upon a most daring and fateful adventure.  And, as a matter\nof fact, never in her life had she done anything that so intensely\ninterested her.  She felt that she was for the first time slackening\nrein upon those unconventional instincts, of unknown strength and\npurpose, which had been making her restless with their vague stirrings.\n\n\"How silly of me!\" she thought.  \"I'm doing a commonplace, rather\ncommon thing--and I'm trying to make it seem a daring, romantic\nadventure.  I MUST be hard up for excitement!\"\n\nToward the middle of the afternoon she dropped from her horse before\nthe office of the New Day and gave a boy the bridle. \"I'll be back in a\nminute,\" she explained.  It was a two-story frame building, dingy and\nin disrepair.  On the street floor was a grocery.  Access to the New\nDay was by a rickety stairway.  As she ascended this, making a great\nnoise on its unsteady boards with her boots, she began to feel cheap\nand foolish.  She recalled what Hull had said in the carriage.  \"No\ndoubt,\" replied she, \"I'd feel much the same way if I were going to see\nJesus Christ--a carpenter's son, sitting in some hovel, talking with\nhis friends the fishermen and camel drivers--not to speak of the women.\"\n\nThe New Day occupied two small rooms--an editorial work room, and a\nprinting work room behind it.  Jane Hastings, in the doorway at the\nhead of the stairs, was seeing all there was to see.  In the editorial\nroom were two tables--kitchen tables, littered with papers and\njournals, as was the floor, also.  At the table directly opposite the\ndoor no one was sitting--\"Victor Dorn's desk,\" Jane decided.  At the\ntable by the open window sat a girl, bent over her writing.  Jane saw\nthat the figure was below, probably much below, the medium height for\nwoman, that it was slight and strong, that it was clad in a simple,\nclean gray linen dress.  The girl's black hair, drawn into a plain but\ndistinctly graceful knot, was of that dense and wavy thickness which is\na characteristic and a beauty of the Hebrew race.  The skin at the nape\nof her neck, on her hands, on her arms bare to the elbows was of a\nbeautiful dead-white--the skin that so admirably compliments dead-black\nhair.\n\nBefore disturbing this busy writer Jane glanced round.  There was\nnothing to detain her in the view of the busy printing plant in the\nroom beyond.  But on the walls of the room before her were four\npictures--lithographs, cheap, not framed, held in place by a tack at\neach corner.  There was Washington--then Lincoln--then a copy of\nLeonardo's Jesus in the Last Supper fresco--and a fourth face, bearded,\npowerful, imperious, yet wonderfully kind and good humored--a face she\ndid not know.  Pointing her riding stick at it she said:\n\n\"And who is that?\"\n\nWith a quick but not in the least a startled movement the girl at the\ntable straightened her form, turned in her chair, saying, as she did\nso, without having seen the pointing stick:\n\n\"That is Marx--Karl Marx.\"\n\nJane was so astonished by the face she was now seeing--the face of the\ngirl--that she did not hear the reply.  The girl's hair and skin had\nreminded her of what Martha had told her about the Jewish, or\nhalf-Jewish, origin of Selma Gordon.  Thus, she assumed that she would\nsee a frankly Jewish face.  Instead, the face looking at her from\nbeneath the wealth of thick black hair, carelessly parted near the\ncentre, was Russian--was Cossack--strange and primeval, intense, dark,\nas superbly alive as one of those exuberant tropical flowers that seem\nto cry out the mad joy of life.  Only, those flowers suggest the\nevanescent, the flame burning so fiercely that it must soon burn out,\nwhile this Russian girl declared that life was eternal.  You could not\nthink of her as sick, as old, as anything but young and vigorous and\nvivid, as full of energy as a healthy baby that kicks its dresses into\nrags and wears out the strength of its strapping nurse.  Her nose was\nas straight as Jane's own particularly fine example of nose.  Her dark\ngray eyes, beneath long, slender, coal black lines of brow, were\nbrimming with life and with fun.  She had a wide, frank, scarlet mouth;\nher teeth were small and sharp and regular, and of the strong and\nhealthy shade of white.  She had a very small, but a very resolute\nchin.  With another quick, free movement she stood up.  She was indeed\nsmall, but formed in proportion.  She seemed out of harmony with her\nlinen dress.  She looked as if she ought to be careening on the steppes\nin some romantic, half-savage costume.  Jane's first and instant\nthought was, \"There's not another like her in the whole world.  She's\nthe only living specimen of her kind.\"\n\n\"Gracious!\" exclaimed Jane.  \"But you ARE healthy.\"\n\nThe smile took full advantage of the opportunity to broaden into a\nlaugh.  A most flattering expression of frank, childlike admiration\ncame into the dark gray eyes.  \"You're not sickly, yourself,\" replied\nSelma.  Jane was disappointed that the voice was not untamed Cossack,\nbut was musically civilized.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't flaunt it as you do,\" rejoined Jane.  \"You'd make\nanyone who was the least bit off, furious.\"\n\nSelma, still with the child-like expression, but now one of curiosity,\nwas examining Jane's masculine riding dress.  \"What a sensible suit!\"\nshe cried, delightedly.  \"I'd wear something like that all the time, if\nI dared.\"\n\n\"Dared?\" said Jane.  \"You don't look like the frightened sort.\"\n\n\"Not on account of myself,\" explained Selma.  \"On account of the cause.\nYou see, we are fighting for a new idea.  So, we have to be careful not\nto offend people's prejudices about ideas not so important.  If we went\nin for everything that's sensible, we'd be regarded as cranks.  One\nthing at a time.\"\n\nJane's glance shifted to the fourth picture.  \"Didn't you say that\nwas--Karl Marx?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He wrote a book on political economy.  I tried to read it at college.\nBut I couldn't.  It was too heavy for me.  He was a Socialist--wasn't\nhe?--the founder of Socialism?\"\n\n\"A great deal more than that,\" replied Selma.  \"He was the most\nimportant man for human liberty that ever lived--except perhaps one.\"\nAnd she looked at Leonardo's \"man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.\"\n\n\"Marx was a--a Hebrew--wasn't he?\"\n\nSelma's eyes danced, and Jane felt that she was laughing at her\nhesitation and choice of the softer word.  Selma said:\n\n\"Yes--he was a Jew.  Both were Jews.\"\n\n\"Both?\" inquired Jane, puzzled.\n\n\"Marx and Jesus,\" explained Selma.\n\nJane was startled.  \"So HE was a Jew--wasn't He?\"\n\n\"And they were both labor leaders--labor agitators.  The first one\nproclaimed the brotherhood of man.  But he regarded this world as\nhopeless and called on the weary and heavy laden masses to look to the\nnext world for the righting of their wrongs. Then--eighteen centuries\nafter--came that second Jew\"--Selma looked passionate, reverent\nadmiration at the powerful, bearded face, so masterful, yet so\nkind--\"and he said:  'No! not in the hereafter, but in the here.  Here\nand now, my brothers.  Let us make this world a heaven.  Let us redeem\nourselves and destroy the devil of ignorance who is holding us in this\nhell.'  It was three hundred years before that first Jew began to\ntriumph.  It won't be so long before there are monuments to Marx in\nclean and beautiful and free cities all over the earth.\"\n\nJane listened intensely.  There was admiring envy in her eyes as she\ncried:  \"How splendid!--to believe in something--and work for it and\nlive for it--as you do!\"\n\nSelma laughed, with a charming little gesture of the shoulders and the\nhands that reminded Jane of her foreign parentage. \"Nothing else seems\nworth while,\" said she.  \"Nothing else is worth while.  There are only\ntwo entirely great careers--to be a teacher of the right kind and work\nto ease men's minds--as those four did--or to be a doctor of the right\nkind and work to make mankind healthy.  All the suffering, all the\ncrime, all the wickedness, comes from ignorance or bad health--or both.\nUsually it's simply bad health.\"\n\nJane felt as if she were devoured of thirst and drinking at a fresh,\nsparkling spring.  \"I never thought of that before,\" said she.\n\n\"If you find out all about any criminal, big or little, you'll discover\nthat he had bad health--poisons in his blood that goaded him on.\"\n\nJane nodded.  \"Whenever I'm difficult to get on with, I'm always not\nquite well.\"\n\n\"I can see that your disposition is perfect, when you are well,\" said\nSelma.\n\n\"And yours,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Oh, I'm never out of humor,\" said Selma.  \"You see, I'm never\nsick--not the least bit.\"\n\n\"You are Miss Gordon, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes--I'm Selma Gordon.\"\n\n\"My name is Jane Hastings.\"  Then as this seemed to convey nothing to\nSelma, Jane added:  \"I'm not like you.  I haven't an individuality of\nmy own--that anybody knows about.  So, I'll have to identify myself by\nsaying that I'm Martin Hastings' daughter.\"\n\nJane confidently expected that this announcement would cause some sort\nof emotion--perhaps of awe, perhaps of horror, certainly of interest.\nShe was disappointed.  If Selma felt anything she did not show it--and\nJane was of the opinion that it would be well nigh impossible for so\ndirect and natural a person to conceal. Jane went on:\n\n\"I read in your paper about your fund for sick children.  I was riding\npast your office--saw the sign--and I've come in to give what I happen\nto have about me.\"  She drew out the small roll of bills and handed it\nto Selma.\n\nThe Russian girl--if it is fair thus to characterize one so intensely\nAmerican in manner, in accent and in speech--took the money and said:\n\n\"We'll acknowledge it in the paper next week.\"\n\nJane flushed and a thrill of alarm ran through her. \"Oh--please--no,\"\nshe urged.  \"I'd not like to have my name mentioned.  That would look\nas if I had done it to seem charitable.  Besides, it's such a trifle.\"\n\nSelma was calm and apparently unsuspicious.  \"Very well,\" said she.\n\"We'll write, telling what we did with the money, so that you can\ninvestigate.\"\n\n\"But I trust you entirely,\" cried Jane.\n\nSelma shook her head.  \"But we don't wish to be trusted,\" said she.\n\"Only dishonest people wish to be trusted when it's possible to avoid\ntrusting.  And we all need watching.  It helps us to keep straight.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't agree with you,\" protested Miss Hastings.  \"Lots of the\ntime I'd hate to be watched.  I don't want everybody to know all I do.\"\n\nSelma's eyes opened.  \"Why not?\" she said.\n\nJane cast about for a way to explain what seemed to her a self-evident\ntruth.  \"I mean--privacy,\" she said.  \"For instance, if you were in\nlove, you'd not want everybody to know about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" declared Selma.  \"I'd be tremendously proud of it.  It\nmust be wonderful to be in love.\"\n\nIn one of those curious twists of feminine nature, Miss Hastings\nsuddenly felt the glow of a strong, unreserved liking for this strange,\ncandid girl.\n\nSelma went on:  \"But I'm afraid I never shall be.  I get no time to\nthink about myself.  From rising till bed time my work pushes at me.\"\nShe glanced uneasily at her desk, apologetically at Miss Hastings.  \"I\nought to be writing this minute.  The strike is occupying Victor, and\nI'm helping out with his work.\"\n\n\"I'm interrupting,\" said Jane.  \"I'll go.\"  She put out her hand with\nher best, her sweetest smile.  \"We're going to be friends--aren't we?\"\n\nSelma clasped her hand heartily and said:  \"We ARE friends.  I like\neverybody.  There's always something to like in everyone--and the bad\npart isn't their fault.  But it isn't often that I like anyone so much\nas I do you.  You are so direct and honest--quite different from the\nother women of your class that I've met.\"\n\nJane felt unaccountably grateful and humble.  \"I'm afraid you're too\ngenerous.  I guess you're not a very good judge of people,\" she said.\n\n\"So Victor--Victor Dorn--says,\" laughed Selma.  \"He says I'm too\nconfiding.  Well--why not?  And really, he trusts everybody,\ntoo--except with the cause.  Then he's--he's\"--she glanced from face to\nface of the four pictures--\"he's like those men.\"\n\nJane's glance followed Selma's.  She said:  \"Yes--I should imagine\nso--from what I've heard.\"  She startled, flushed, hid behind a\nsomewhat constrained manner.  \"Will you come up to my house to lunch?\"\n\n\"If I can find time,\" said Selma.  \"But I'd rather come and take you\nfor a walk.  I have to walk two hours every day.  It's the only thing\nthat'll keep my head clear.\"\n\n\"When will you come?--to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Is nine o'clock too early?\"\n\nJane reflected that her father left for business at half-past eight.\n\"Nine to-morrow,\" she said.  \"Good-by again.\"\n\nAs she was mounting her horse, she saw \"the Cossack girl,\" as she was\ncalling her, writing away at the window hardly three feet above the\nlevel of Jane's head when she was mounted, so low was the first story\nof the battered old frame house.  But Selma did not see her; she was\nall intent upon the writing.  \"She's forgotten me already,\" thought\nJane with a pang of jealous vanity.  She added:  \"But SHE has SOMETHING\nto think about--she and Victor Dorn.\"\n\nShe was so preoccupied that she rode away with only an absent thank you\nfor the small boy, in an older and much larger and wider brother's\ncast-off shirt, suspenders and trousers.  At the corner of the avenue\nshe remembered and turned her horse.  There stood the boy gazing after\nher with a hypnotic intensity that made her smile.  She rode back\nfumbling in her pockets.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said she to the boy.\nThen she called up to Selma Gordon:\n\n\"Miss Gordon--please--will you lend me a quarter until to-morrow?\"\n\nSelma looked up, stared dazedly at her, smiled absently at Miss\nHastings--and Miss Hastings had the strongest confirmation of her\nsuspicion that Selma had forgotten her and her visit the instant she\nvanished from the threshold of the office.  Said Selma:  \"A\nquarter?--oh, yes--certainly.\"  She seemed to be searching a drawer or\na purse out of sight.  \"I haven't anything but a five dollar bill.  I'm\nso sorry\"--this in an absent manner, with most of her thoughts\nevidently still upon her work.  She rose, leaned from the window,\nglanced up the street, then down.  She went on:\n\n\"There comes Victor Dorn.  He'll lend it to you.\"\n\nAlong the ragged brick walk at a quick pace the man who had in such\nabrupt fashion stormed Jane Hasting's fancy and taken possession of her\ncuriosity was advancing with a basket on his arm.  He was indeed a man\nof small stature--about the medium height for a woman--about the height\nof Jane Hastings.  But his figure was so well put together and his walk\nso easy and free from self-consciousness that the question of stature\nno sooner arose than it was dismissed.  His head commanded all the\nattention--its poise and the remarkable face that fronted it. The\nfeatures were bold, the skin was clear and healthy and rather fair.\nHis eyes--gray or green blue and set neither prominently nor\nretreatedly--seemed to be seeing and understanding all that was going\non about him.  He had a strong, rather relentless mouth--the mouth of\nmen who make and compel sacrifices for their ambitions.\n\n\"Victor,\" cried Selma as soon as he was within easy range of her voice,\n\"please lend Miss Hastings a quarter.\"  And she immediately sat down\nand went to work again, with the incident dismissed from mind.\n\nThe young man--for he was plainly not far beyond thirty--halted and\nregarded the young woman on the horse.\n\n\"I wish to give this young gentleman here a quarter,\" said Jane.  \"He\nwas very good about holding my horse.\"\n\nThe words were not spoken before the young gentleman darted across the\nnarrow street and into a yard hidden by masses of clematis, morning\nglory and sweet peas.  And Jane realized that she had wholly mistaken\nthe meaning of that hypnotic stare.\n\nVictor laughed--the small figure, the vast clothes, the bare feet with\nvoluminous trousers about them made a ludicrous sight.  \"He doesn't\nwant it,\" said Victor.  \"Thank you just the same.\"\n\n\"But I want him to have it,\" said Jane.\n\nWith a significant unconscious glance at her costume Dorn said: \"Those\ncostumes haven't reached our town yet.\"\n\n\"He did some work for me.  I owe it to him.\"\n\n\"He's my sister's little boy,\" said Dorn, with his amiable, friendly\nsmile.  \"We mustn't start him in the bad way of expecting pay for\npoliteness.\"\n\nJane colored as if she had been rebuked, when in fact his tone forbade\nthe suggestion of rebuke.  There was an unpleasant sparkle in her eyes\nas she regarded the young man in the baggy suit, with the basket on his\narm.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said she coldly.  \"I naturally didn't know\nyour peculiar point of view.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Dorn carelessly.  \"Thank you, and good day.\"\nAnd with a polite raising of the hat and a manner of good humored\nfriendliness that showed how utterly unconscious he was of her being\noffended at him, he hastened across the street and went in at the gate\nwhere the boy had vanished.  And Jane had the sense that he had\nforgotten her.  She glanced nervously up at the window to see whether\nSelma Gordon was witnessing her humiliation--for so she regarded it.\nBut Selma was evidently lost in a world of her own.  \"She doesn't love\nhim,\" Jane decided.  \"For, even though she is a strange kind of person,\nshe's a woman--and if she had loved him she couldn't have helped\nwatching while he talked with another woman--especially with one of my\nappearance and class.\"\n\nJane rode slowly away.  At the corner--it was a long block--she glanced\ntoward the scene she had just quitted.  Involuntarily she drew rein.\nVictor and the boy had come out into the street and were playing\ncatches.  The game did not last long.  Dorn let the boy corner him and\nseize him, then gave him a great toss into the air, catching him as he\ncame down and giving him a hug and a kiss.  The boy ran shouting\nmerrily into the yard; Victor disappeared in the entrance to the\noffices of the New Day.\n\nThat evening, as she pretended to listen to Hull on national politics,\nand while dressing the following morning Jane reflected upon her\nadventure.  She decided that Dorn and the \"wild girl\" were a low,\nill-mannered pair with whom she had nothing in common, that her\nfantastic, impulsive interest in them had been killed, that for the\nfuture she would avoid \"all that sort of cattle.\"  She would receive\nSelma Gordon politely, of course--would plead headache as an excuse for\nnot walking, would get rid of her as soon as possible.  \"No doubt,\"\nthought Jane, with the familiar, though indignantly denied, complacence\nof her class, \"as soon as she gets in here she'll want to hang on.  She\nplayed it very well, but she must have been crazy with delight at my\nnoticing her and offering to take her up.\"\n\nThe postman came as Jane was finishing breakfast.  He brought a note\nfrom Selma--a hasty pencil scrawl on a sheet of printer's copy paper:\n\n\n\"Dear Miss Hastings:  For the present I'm too busy to take my walks.\nSo, I'll not be there to-morrow.  With best regards, S.G.\"\n\n\nSuch a fury rose up in Jane that the undigested breakfast went wrong\nand put her in condition to give such exhibition as chance might tempt\nof that ugliness of disposition which appears from time to time in all\nof us not of the meek and worm-like class, and which we usually\nattribute to any cause under the sun but the vulgar right one.  \"The\nimpertinence!\" muttered Jane, with a second glance at the note which\nconveyed; among other humiliating things, an impression of her own\nabsolute lack of importance to Selma Gordon.  \"Serves me right for\nlowering myself to such people.  If I wanted to try to do anything for\nthe working class I'd have to keep away from them.  They're so\nunattractive to look at and to associate with--not like those shrewd,\nrespectful, interesting peasants one finds on the other side.  They're\nbetter in the East.  They know their place in a way.  But out here\nthey're insufferable.\"\n\nAnd she spent the morning quarrelling with her maid and the other\nservants, issuing orders right and left, working herself into a\nhorrible mood dominated by a headache that was anything but a pretense.\nAs she wandered about the house and gardens, she trailed a beautiful\nnegligee with that carelessness which in a woman of clean and orderly\nhabits invariably indicates the possession of many clothes and of a\nmaid who can be counted on to freshen things up before they shall be\nused again.  Her father came home to lunch in high good humor.\n\n\"I'll not go down town again for a few days,\" said he.  \"I reckon I'd\nbest keep out of the way.  That scoundrelly Victor Dorn has done so\nmuch lying and inciting these last four or five years that it ain't\nsafe for a man like me to go about when there's trouble with the hands.\"\n\n\"Isn't it outrageous!\" exclaimed Jane.  \"He ought to be stopped.\"\n\nHastings chuckled and nodded.  \"And he will be,\" said he. \"Wait till\nthis strike's over.\"\n\n\"When will that be?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"Mighty soon,\" replied her father.  \"I was ready for 'em this\ntime--good and ready.  I've sent word to the governor that I want the\nmilitia down here tomorrow----\"\n\n\"Has there been a riot?\" cried Jane anxiously.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Hastings.  He was laughing to himself.  \"But there will\nbe to-night.  Then the governor'll send the troops in to-morrow\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"But maybe the men'll be quiet, and then----\" began Jane, sick inside\nand trembling.\n\n\"When I say a thing'll happen, it'll happen,\" interrupted her father.\n\"We've made up our minds it's time to give these fellows a lesson.\nIt's got to be done.  A milder lesson'll serve now, where later on it'd\nhave to be hard.  I tell you these things because I want you to\nremember 'em.  They'll come in handy--when you'll have to look after\nyour own property.\"\n\nShe knew how her father hated the thought of his own death; this was\nthe nearest he had ever come to speaking of it.  \"Of course, there's\nyour brother William,\" he went on.  \"William's a good boy--and a mighty\ngood business man--though he does take risks I'd never 'a took--not\neven when I was young and had nothing to lose.  Yes--and Billy's\nhonest.  BUT\"--the big head shook impressively--\"William's human,\nJenny--don't ever forget that. The love of money's an awful thing.\"  A\nlustful glitter like the shine of an inextinguishable fire made his\neyes fascinating and terrible.  \"It takes hold of a man and never lets\ngo.  To see the money pile up--and up--and up.\"\n\nThe girl turned away her gaze.  She did not wish to see so far into her\nfather's soul.  It seemed a hideous indecency.\n\n\"So, Jenny--don't trust William, but look after your own property.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care anything about it, popsy,\" she cried, fighting to\nthink of him and to speak to him as simply the living father she had\nalways insisted on seeing.\n\n\"Yes--you do care,\" said Hastings sharply.  \"You've got to have your\nmoney, because that's your foundation--what you're built on.  And I'm\ngoing to train you.  This here strike's a good time to begin.\"\n\nAfter a long silence she said:  \"Yes, money's what I'm built on. I\nmight as well recognize the truth and act accordingly.  I want you to\nteach me, father.\"\n\n\"I've got to educate you so as, when you get control, you won't go and\ndo fool sentimental things like some women--and some men that warn't\ntrained practically--men like that Davy Hull you think so well of.\nThings that'd do no good and 'd make you smaller and weaker.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the girl.  \"About this strike--WHY won't you give\nthe men shorter hours and better pay?\"\n\n\"Because the company can't afford it.  As things are now, there's only\nenough left for a three per cent dividend after the interest on the\nbonds is paid.\"\n\nShe had read in the New Day that by a series of tricks the \"traction\nring\" had quadrupled the bonded indebtedness of the roads and\nmultiplied the stock by six, and had pocketed the proceeds of the\nsteal; that three per cent on the enormously inflated capital was in\nfact eighteen per cent on the actual stock value; that seven per cent\non the bonds was in fact twenty-eight per cent on the actual bonded\nindebtedness; that this traction steal was a fair illustration of how\nin a score of ways in Remsen City, in a thousand and one ways in all\nparts of the country, the upper class was draining away the substance\nof the masses, was swindling them out of their just wages, was forcing\nthem to pay many times the just prices for every article of civilized\nuse.  She had read these things--she had thought about them--she had\nrealized that they were true.\n\nShe did not put to her father the question that was on her lips--the\nnext logical question after his answer that the company could not\nafford to cut the hours lower than fourteen or to raise wages to what\nwas necessary for a man to have if he and his family were to live, not\nin decency and comfort, but in something less than squalor.  She did\nnot put the question because she wished to spare her father--to spare\nherself the shame of hearing his tricky answer--to spare herself the\ndiscomfort of squarely facing a nasty truth.\n\nInstead she said:  \"I understand.  And you have got to look out for the\nrights of the people who have invested their money.\"\n\n\"If I didn't I'd be cheating them,\" said Hastings.  \"And if the men\ndon't like their jobs, why, they can quit and get jobs they do like.\"\nHe added, in absolute unconsciousness of his inconsistency, in absolute\nbelief in his own honesty and goodness, \"The truth is our company pays\nas high wages as can be got anywhere.  As for them hours--when _I_ was\nworking my way up, _I_ used to put in sixteen and eighteen hours a day,\nand was mighty glad to do it.  This lazy talk of cutting down hours\nmakes me sick.  And these fellows that're always kicking on their jobs,\nI'd like to know what'd become of them and their families if I and men\nlike me didn't provide work for 'em.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" cried Jane, eagerly seizing upon this attractive view of\nthe situation--and resolutely accepting it without question.\n\nIn came one of the maids, saying:  \"There's a man wants to see you, Mr.\nHastings.\"\n\n\"What's his name?  What does he want?\" inquired Hastings, while Jane\nmade a mental note that she must try to inject at least a little order\nand form into the manners of announcing visitors.\n\n\"He didn't give a name.  He just said, 'Tell the old man I want to see\nhim.'  I ain't sure, but I think it's Dick Kelly.\"\n\nAs Lizzie was an ardent Democrat, she spoke the name\ncontemptuously--for Dick Kelly was the Republican boss.  If it had been\nHouse, the Democratic boss and Kelly's secret dependent and henchman,\nshe would have said \"Mr. Joseph House\" in a tone of deep respect.\n\n\"Kelly,\" said Hastings.  \"Must be something important or he'd 'a\ntelephoned or asked me to see him at my office or at the Lincoln Club.\nHe never came out here before.  Bring him in, Lizzie.\"\n\nA moment and there appeared in the doorway a man of perhaps forty years\nwho looked like a prosperous contractor who had risen from the ranks.\nHis figure was notable for its solidity and for the power of the\nshoulders; but already there were indications that the solidity, come\nof hard manual labor in early life, was soon to soften into fat under\nthe melting influence of prosperity and the dissipation it put within\ntoo easy reach.  The striking features of his face were a pair of keen,\nhard, greenish eyes and a jaw that protruded uglily--the jaw of\naggressiveness, not the too prominent jaw of weakness.  At sight of\nJane he halted awkwardly.\n\n\"How're you, Mr. Hastings?\" said he.\n\n\"Hello, Dick,\" said the old man.  \"This is my daughter Jane.\"\n\nJane smiled a pleasant recognition of the introduction.  Kelly said\nstiffly, \"How're you, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Want to see me alone, I suppose?\" Hastings went on.  \"You go out on\nthe porch, Jenny.\"\n\nAs soon as Jane disappeared Kelly's stiffness and clumsiness vanished.\nTo head off Hastings' coming offer of a cigar, he drew one from his\npocket and lighted it.  \"There's hell to pay, Mr. Hastings,\" he began,\nseating himself near the old man, tilting back in his chair and\ncrossing his legs.\n\n\"Well, I reckon you can take care of it,\" said Hastings calmly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, we kin take care of it, all right.  Only, I don't want to do\nnothing without consulting you.\"\n\nIn these two statements Mr. Kelly summed up the whole of politics in\nRemsen City, in any city anywhere, in the country at large.\n\nKelly had started life as a blacksmith.  But he soon tired of the\ndullness and toil and started forth to find some path up to where men\nlive by making others work for them instead of plodding along at the\nhand-to-mouth existence that is the lot of those who live by their own\nlabors alone.  He was a safe blower for a while, but wisely soon\nabandoned that fascinating but precarious and unremunerative career.\nFrom card sharp following the circus and sheet-writer to a bookmaker he\ngraduated into bartender, into proprietor of a doggery.  As every\nsaloon is a political club, every saloon-keeper is of necessity a\npolitician.  Kelly's woodbox happened to be a convenient place for\ndirecting the floaters and the repeaters.  Kelly's political importance\ngrew apace.  His respectability grew more slowly.  But it had grown and\nwas growing.\n\nIf you had asked Lizzie, the maid, why she was a Democrat, she would\nhave given no such foolish reason as the average man gives.\n\nShe would not have twaddled about principles--when everyone with\neyeteeth cut ought to know that principles have departed from politics,\nnow that both parties have been harmonized and organized into agencies\nof the plutocracy.  She would not have said she was a Democrat because\nher father was, or because all her friends and associates were.  She\nwould have replied--in pleasantly Americanized Irish:\n\n\"I'm a Democrat because when my father got too old to work, Mr. House,\nthe Democrat leader, gave him a job on the elevator at the Court\nHouse--though that dirty thief and scoundrel, Kelly, the Republican\nboss, owned all the judges and county officers.  And when my brother\nlost his place as porter because he took a drink too many, Mr. House\ngave him a card to the foreman of the gas company, and he went to work\nat eight a week and is there yet.\"\n\nMr. Kelly and Mr. House belong to a maligned and much misunderstood\nclass.  Whenever you find anywhere in nature an activity of any kind,\nhowever pestiferous its activity may seem to you--or however good--you\nmay be sure that if you look deep enough you will find that that\nactivity has a use, arises from a need.  The \"robber trusts\" and the\npolitical bosses are interesting examples of this basic truth.  They\nhave arisen because science, revolutionizing human society, has\ncompelled it to organize.  The organization is crude and clumsy and\nstupid, as yet, because men are ignorant, are experimenting, are\nworking in the dark.  So, the organizing forces are necessarily crude\nand clumsy and stupid.\n\nMr. Hastings was--all unconsciously--organizing society industrially.\nMr. Kelly--equally unconscious of the true nature of his\nactivities--was organizing society politically.  And as industry and\npolitics are--and ever have been--at bottom two names for identically\nthe same thing, Mr. Hastings and Mr. Kelly were bound sooner or later\nto get together.\n\nRemsen City was organized like every other large or largish community.\nThere were two clubs--the Lincoln and the Jefferson--which well enough\nrepresented the \"respectable elements\"--that is, those citizens who\nwere of the upper class. There were two other clubs--the Blaine and the\nTilden--which were similarly representative of the \"rank and file\" and,\nrather, of the petty officers who managed the rank and file and voted\nit and told it what to think and what not to think, in exchange taking\ncare of the needy sick, of the aged, of those out of work and so on.\nMartin Hastings--the leading Republican citizen of Remsen City, though\nfor obvious reasons his political activities were wholly secret and\nstealthy--was the leading spirit in the Lincoln Club.  Jared\nOlds--Remsen City's richest and most influential Democrat, the head of\nthe gas company and the water company--was foremost in the Jefferson\nClub.  At the Lincoln and the Jefferson you rarely saw any but\n\"gentlemen\"--men of established position and fortune, deacons and\nvestrymen, judges, corporation lawyers and the like.  The Blaine and\nthe Tilden housed a livelier and a far less select class--the\n\"boys\"--the active politicians, the big saloon keepers, the criminal\nlawyers, the gamblers, the chaps who knew how to round up floaters and\nto handle gangs of repeaters, the active young sports working for\npolitical position, by pitching and carrying for the political leaders,\nby doing their errands of charity or crookedness or what not.  Joe\nHouse was the \"big shout\" at the Tilden; Dick Kelly could be found\nevery evening on the third--or \"wine,\" or plotting--floor of the\nBlaine--found holding court.  And very respectful indeed were even the\nmost eminent of Lincoln, or Jefferson, respectabilities who sought him\nout there to ask favors of him.\n\nThe bosses tend more and more to become mere flunkeys of the\nplutocrats.  Kelly belonged to the old school of boss, dating from the\ndays when social organization was in the early stages, when the\npolitical organizer was feared and even served by the industrial\norganizer, the embryo plutocrats.  He realized how necessary he was to\nhis plutocratic master, and he made that master treat him almost as an\nequal.  He was exacting ever larger pay for taking care of the voters\nand keeping them fooled; he was getting rich, and had as yet vague\naspirations to respectability and fashion.  He had stopped drinking,\nhad \"cut out the women,\" had made a beginning toward a less inelegant\nway of speaking the language.  His view of life was what is called\ncynical.  That is, he regarded himself as morally the equal of the\nrespectable rulers of society--or of the preachers who attended to the\nreligious part of the grand industry of \"keeping the cow quiet while it\nwas being milked.\"\n\nBut Mr. Kelly was explaining to Martin Hastings what he meant when he\nsaid that there was \"hell to pay\":\n\n\"That infernal little cuss, Victor Dorn,\" said he \"made a speech in the\nCourt House Square to-day.  Of course, none of the decent papers--and\nthey're all decent except his'n--will publish any of it.  Still, there\nwas about a thousand people there before he got through--and the\nthing'll spread.\"\n\n\"Speech?--what about?\" said Hastings.  \"He's always shooting off his\nmouth.  He'd better stop talking and go to work at some honest\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"He's got on to the fact that this strike is a put-up job--that the\ncompany hired labor detectives in Chicago last winter to come down here\nand get hold of the union.  He gave names--amounts paid--the whole damn\nthing.\"\n\n\"Um,\" said Hastings, rubbing his skinny hands along the shiny\npantaloons over his meagre legs.  \"Um.\"\n\n\"But that ain't all,\" pursued Kelly.  \"He read out a list of the men\ntold off to pretend to set fire to the car barns and start the\nriot--those Chicago chaps, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" said Hastings sharply.\n\nKelly smiled slightly--amused scorn.  It seemed absurd to him for the\nold man to keep up the pretense of ignorance.  In fact, Hastings was\nignorant--of the details.  He was not quite the aloof plutocrat of the\nmodern school, who permits himself to know nothing of details beyond\nthe dividend rate and similar innocent looking results of causes at\nwhich sometimes hell itself would shudder.  But, while he was more\nactive than the conscience-easing devices now working smoothly made\nnecessary, he never permitted himself to know any unnecessary criminal\nor wicked fact about his enterprises.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he repeated.  \"And I don't want to know.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, Dorn gave away the whole thing.  He even read a copy of your\nletter of introduction to the governor--the one you--according to\nDorn--gave Fillmore when you sent him up to the Capitol to arrange for\nthe invitation to come after the riot.\"\n\nHastings knew that the boss was deliberately \"rubbing it in\" because\nHastings--that is, Hastings' agents had not invited Kelly to assist in\nthe project for \"teaching the labor element a much needed lesson.\"  But\nknowledge of Kelly's motive did not make the truth he was telling any\nless true--the absurd mismanagement of the whole affair, with the\nresult that Dorn seemed in the way to change it from a lesson to labor\non the folly of revolt against their kind and generous but firm\nemployers into a provoker of fresh and fiercer revolt--effective\nrevolt--political revolt.  So, as Kelly \"rubbed,\" Hastings visibly\nwinced and writhed.\n\nKelly ended his recital with:  \"The speech created a hell of a\nsensation, Mr. Hastings.  That young chap can talk.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" snapped Hastings.  \"But he can't do anything else.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" replied Kelly, who was wise enough to\nrealize the value of a bogey like Dorn--its usefulness for purposes of\n\"throwing a scare into the silk-stocking crowd.\" \"Dorn's getting mighty\nstrong with the people.\"\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" retorted Hastings.  \"They'll listen to any slick\ntongued rascal that roasts those that are more prosperous than they\nare.  But when it comes to doing anything, they know better.  They envy\nand hate those that give them jobs, but they need the jobs.\"\n\n\"There's a good deal of truth in that, Mr. Hastings,\" said Kelly, who\nwas nothing if not judicial.  \"But Dorn's mighty plausible.  I hear\nsensible men saying there's something more'n hot air in his facts and\nfiggures.\"  Kelly paused, and made the pause significant.\n\n\"About that last block of traction stock, Mr. Hastings.  I thought you\nwere going to let me in on the ground floor.  But I ain't heard\nnothing.\"\n\n\"You ARE in,\" said Hastings, who knew when to yield.  \"Hasn't Barker\nbeen to see you?  I'll attend to it, myself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Hastings,\" said Kelly--dry and brief as always when\nreceipting with a polite phrase for pay for services rendered.  \"I've\nbeen a good friend to your people.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have, Dick,\" said the old man heartily.  \"And I want you to\njump in and take charge.\"\n\nHastings more than suspected that Kelly, to bring him to terms and to\nforce him to employ directly the high-priced Kelly or\nRepublico-Democratic machine as well as the State Republico-Democratic\nmachine, which was cheaper, had got together the inside information and\nhad ordered one of his henchmen to convey it to Dorn.  But of what use\nto quarrel with Kelly?  Of course, he could depose him; but that would\nsimply mean putting another boss in his place--perhaps one more\nexpensive and less efficient.  The time had been when he--and the\nplutocracy generally--were compelled to come to the political bosses\nalmost hat in hand.  That time was past, never to return.  But still a\ncompetent political agent was even harder to find than a competent\nbusiness manager--and was far more necessary; for, while a big business\nmight stagger along under poor financial or organizing management\nwithin, it could not live at all without political favors, immunities,\nand licenses.  A band of pickpockets might as well try to work a town\nwithout having first \"squared\" the police.  Not that Mr. Hastings and\nhis friends THEMSELVES compared themselves to a band of pickpockets.\nNo, indeed.  It was simply legitimate business to blackjack your\ncompetitors, corner a supply, create a monopoly and fix prices and\nwages to suit your own notions of what was your due for taking the\n\"hazardous risks of business enterprise.\"\n\n\"Leave everything to me,\" said Kelly briskly.  \"I can put the thing\nthrough.  Just tell your lawyer to apply late this afternoon to Judge\nLansing for an injunction forbidding the strikers to assemble anywhere\nwithin the county.  We don't want no more of this speechifying.  This\nis a peaceable community, and it won't stand for no agitators.\"\n\n\"Hadn't the lawyers better go to Judge Freilig?\" said Hastings.\n\n\"He's shown himself to be a man of sound ideas.\"\n\n\"No--Lansing,\" said Kelly.  \"He don't come up for re-election for five\nyears.  Freilig comes up next fall, and we'll have hard work to pull\nhim through, though House is going to put him on the ticket, too.\nDorn's going to make a hot campaign--concentrate on judges.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in that Dorn talk,\" said Hastings.  \"You can't scare\nme again, Dick, as you did with that Populist mare's nest ten years\nago.\"\n\nThat had been Kelly's first \"big killing\" by working on the fears of\nthe plutocracy.  Its success had put him in a position to buy a\ncarriage and a diamond necklace for Mrs. Kelly and to make first\npayments on a large block of real estate.  \"It was no mare's nest, Mr.\nHastings,\" gravely declared the boss.  \"If I hadn't 'a knowed just how\nto use the money we collected, there'd 'a been a crowd in office for\nfour years that wouldn't 'a been easy to manage, I can tell you.  But\nthey was nothing to this here Dorn crowd. Dorn is----\"\n\n\"We must get rid of him, Dick,\" interrupted Hastings.\n\nThe two men looked at each other--a curious glance--telegraphy. No\nmethod was suggested, no price was offered or accepted.  But in the\ncircumstances those matters became details that would settle\nthemselves; the bargain was struck.\n\n\"He certainly ought to be stopped,\" said Kelly carelessly. \"He's the\nworst enemy the labor element has had in my time.\" He rose.  \"Well, Mr.\nHastings, I must be going.\"  He extended his heavy, strong hand, which\nHastings rose to grasp.  \"I'm glad we're working together again without\nany hitches.  You won't forget about that there stock?\"\n\n\"I'll telephone about it right away, Dick--and about Judge Lansing.\nYou're sure Lansing's all right?  I didn't like those decisions of his\nlast year--the railway cases, I mean.\"\n\n\"That was all right, Mr. Hastings,\" said Kelly with a wave of the hand.\n\"I had to have 'em in the interests of the party.  I knowed the upper\ncourt'd reverse.  No, Lansing's a good party man--a good, sound man in\nevery way.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" said Hastings.\n\nBefore going into his private room to think and plan and telephone, he\nlooked out on the west veranda.  There sat his daughter; and a few feet\naway was David Hull, his long form stretched in a hammock while he\ndiscoursed of his projects for a career as a political reformer.  The\nsight immensely pleased the old man.  When he was a boy David Hull's\ngrandfather, Brainerd Hull, had been the great man of that region; and\nMartin Hastings, a farm hand and the son of a farm hand, had looked up\nat him as the embodiment of all that was grand and aristocratic.  As\nHastings had never travelled, his notions of rank and position all\ncentred about Remsen City.  Had he realized the extent of the world, he\nwould have regarded his ambition for a match between the daughter and\ngranddaughter of a farm hand and the son and grandson of a Remsen City\naristocrat as small and ridiculous. But he did not realize.\n\nDavy saw him and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"No--no--don't disturb yourselves,\" cried the old man.  \"I've got some\nthings to 'tend to.  You and Jenny go right ahead.\"\n\nAnd he was off to his own little room where he conducted his own\nbusiness in his own primitive but highly efficacious way.  A corps of\nexpert accountants could not have disentangled those crabbed,\ncriss-crossed figures; no solver of puzzles could have unravelled the\nmystery of those strange hieroglyphics.  But to the old man there\nwasn't a difficult--or a dull--mark in that entire set of dirty,\ndog-eared little account books.  He spent hours in poring over them.\nJust to turn the pages gave him keen pleasure; to read, and to\nreconstruct from those hints the whole story of some agitating and\nprofitable operation, made in comparison the delight of an imaginative\nboy in Monte Cristo or Crusoe seem a cold and tame emotion.\n\nDavid talked on and on, fancying that Jane was listening and admiring,\nwhen in fact she was busy with her own entirely different train of\nthought.  She kept the young man going because she did not wish to be\nbored with her own solitude, because a man about always made life at\nleast a little more interesting than if she were alone or with a woman,\nand because Davy was good to look at and had an agreeable voice.\n\n\"Why, who's that?\" she suddenly exclaimed, gazing off to the right.\n\nDavy turned and looked.  \"I don't know her,\" he said.  \"Isn't she queer\nlooking--yet I don't know just why.\"\n\n\"It's Selma Gordon,\" said Jane, who had recognized Selma the instant\nher eyes caught a figure moving across the lawn.\n\n\"The girl that helps Victor Dorn?\" said Davy, astonished. \"What's SHE\ncoming HERE for?  You don't know her--do you?\"\n\n\"Don't you?\" evaded Jane.  \"I thought you and Mr. Dorn were such pals.\"\n\n\"Pals?\" laughed Hull.  \"Hardly that.  We meet now and then at a\nworkingman's club I'm interested in--and at a cafe' where I go to get\nin touch with the people occasionally--and in the street.  But I never\ngo to his office.  I couldn't afford to do that.  And I've never seen\nMiss Gordon.\"\n\n\"Well, she's worth seeing,\" said Jane.  \"You'll never see another like\nher.\"\n\nThey rose and watched her advancing.  To the usual person, acutely\nconscious of self, walking is not easy in such circumstances.  But\nSelma, who never bothered about herself, came on with that matchless\nsteady grace which peasant girls often get through carrying burdens on\nthe head.  Jane called out:\n\n\"So, you've come, after all.\"\n\nSelma smiled gravely.  Not until she was within a few feet of the steps\ndid she answer:  \"Yes--but on business.\"  She was wearing the same\nlinen dress.  On her head was a sailor hat, beneath the brim of which\nher amazingly thick hair stood out in a kind of defiance.  This hat,\nthis further article of Western civilization's dress, added to the\nsuggestion of the absurdity of such a person in such clothing.  But in\nher strange Cossack way she certainly was beautiful--and as healthy and\nhardy as if she had never before been away from the high, wind-swept\nplateaus where disease is unknown and where nothing is thought of\nliving to be a hundred or a hundred and twenty-five.  Both before and\nafter the introduction Davy Hull gazed at her with fascinated curiosity\ntoo plainly written upon his long, sallow, serious face.  She, intent\nupon her mission, ignored him as the arrow ignores the other birds of\nthe flock in its flight to the one at which it is aimed.\n\n\"You'll give me a minute or two alone?\" she said to Jane.  \"We can walk\non the lawn here.\"\n\nHull caught up his hat.  \"I was just going,\" said he.  Then he\nhesitated, looked at Selma, stammered:  \"I'll go to the edge of the\nlawn and inspect the view.\"\n\nNeither girl noted this abrupt and absurd change of plan.  He departed.\nAs soon as he had gone half a dozen steps, Selma said in her quick,\ndirect fashion:\n\n\"I've come to see you about the strike.\"\n\nJane tried to look cool and reserved.  But that sort of expression\nseemed foolish in face of the simplicity and candor of Selma Gordon.\nAlso, Jane was not now so well pleased with her father's ideas and\nthose of her own interest as she had been while she was talking with\nhim.  The most exasperating thing about the truth is that, once one has\nbegun to see it--has begun to see what is for him the truth--the honest\ntruth--he can not hide from it ever again.  So, instead of looking cold\nand repellant, Jane looked uneasy and guilty.  \"Oh, yes--the strike,\"\nshe murmured.\n\n\"It is over,\" said Selma.  \"The union met a half hour ago and revoked\nits action--on Victor Dorn's advice.  He showed the men that they had\nbeen trapped into striking by the company--that a riot was to be\nstarted and blamed upon them--that the militia was to be called in and\nthey were to be shot down.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--not that!\" cried Jane eagerly.  \"It wouldn't have gone as far\nas that.\"\n\n\"Yes--as far as that,\" said Selma calmly.  \"That sort of thing is an\nold story.  It's been done so often--and worse.  You see, the\nrespectable gentlemen who run things hire disreputable creatures.  They\ndon't tell them what to do.  They don't need to. The poor wretches\nunderstand what's expected of them--and they do it.  So, the\nrespectable gentlemen can hold up white hands and say quite truthfully,\n'No blood-no filth on these--see!\"' Selma was laughing drearily.  Her\nsuperb, primitive eyes, set ever so little aslant, were flashing with\nan intensity of emotion that gave Jane Hastings a sensation of\nterror-much as if a man who has always lived where there were no\nstorms, but such gentle little rains with restrained and refined\nthunder as usually visit the British Isles, were to find himself in the\nmidst of one of those awful convulsions that come crashing down the\ngorges of the Rockies.  She marveled that one so small of body could\ncontain such big emotions.\n\n\"You mustn't be unjust,\" she pleaded.  \"WE aren't THAT wicked, my dear.\"\n\nSelma looked at her.  \"No matter,\" she said.  \"I am not trying to\nconvert you--or to denounce your friends to you.  I'll explain what\nI've come for.  In his speech to-day and in inducing the union to\nchange, Victor has shown how much power he has.  The men whose plans he\nhas upset will be hating him as men hate only those whom they fear.\"\n\n\"Yes--I believe that,\" said Jane.  \"So, you see, I'm not blindly\nprejudiced.\"\n\n\"For a long time there have been rumors that they might kill him----\"\n\n\"Absurd!\" cried Jane angrily.  \"Miss Gordon, no matter how prejudiced\nyou may be--and I'll admit there are many things to justify you in\nfeeling strongly--but no matter how you may feel, your good sense must\ntell you that men like my father don't commit murder.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" replied Selma.  \"They don't commit murder,\nand they don't order murder.  I'll even say that I don't think they\nwould tolerate murder, even for their benefit.  But you don't know how\nthings are done in business nowadays.  The men like your father have to\nuse men of the Kelly and the House sort--you know who they are?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jane.\n\n\"The Kellys and the Houses give general orders to their lieutenants.\nThe lieutenants pass the orders along--and down. And so on, until all\nsorts of men are engaged in doing all sorts of work.  Dirty, clean,\ncriminal--all sorts.  Some of these men, baffled in what they are\ntrying to do to earn their pay--baffled by Victor Dorn--plot against\nhim.\"  Again that sad, bitter laugh.  \"My dear Miss Hastings, to kill a\ncat there are a thousand ways besides skinning it alive.\"\n\n\"You are prejudiced,\" said Jane, in the manner of one who could not be\nconvinced.\n\nSelma made an impatient gesture.  \"Again I say, no matter. Victor\nlaughs at our fears----\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" said Jane triumphantly.  \"He is less foolish than his\nfollowers.\"\n\n\"He simply does not think about himself,\" replied Selma.  \"And he is\nright.  But it is our business to think about him, because we need him.\nWhere could we find another like him?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose your movement WOULD die out, if  he were not behind it.\"\n\nSelma smiled peculiarly.  \"I think you don't quite understand what we\nare about,\" said she.  \"You've accepted the ignorant notion of your\nclass that we are a lot of silly roosters trying to crow one sun out of\nthe heavens and another into it.  The facts are somewhat different.\nYour class is saying, 'To-day will last forever,' while we are saying,\n'No, to-day will run its course--will be succeeded by to-morrow.  Let\nus not live like the fool who thinks only of the day.  Let us be\nsensible, intelligent, let us realize that there will be to-morrow and\nthat it, too, must be lived.  Let us get ready to live it sensibly. Let\nus build our social system so that it will stand the wear and tear of\nanother day and will not fall in ruins about our heads.'\"\n\n\"I am terribly ignorant about all these things,\" said Jane. \"What a\nridiculous thing my education has been!\"\n\n\"But it hasn't spoiled your heart,\" cried Selma.  And all at once her\neyes were wonderfully soft and tender, and into her voice came a tone\nso sweet that Jane's eyes filled with tears. \"It was to your heart that\nI came to appeal,\" she went on. \"Oh, Miss Hastings--we will do all we\ncan to protect Victor Dorn--and we guard him day and night without his\nknowing it.  But I am afraid--afraid!  And I want you to help.  Will\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'll do anything I can,\" said Jane--a Jane very different from the\nvarious Janes Miss Hastings knew--a Jane who seemed to be conjuring of\nSelma Gordon's enchantments.\n\n\"I want you to ask your father to give him a fair show.  We don't ask\nany favors--for ourselves--for him.  But we don't want to see him--\"\nSelma shuddered and covered her eyes with her hands \"--lying dead in\nsome alley, shot or stabbed by some unknown thug!\"\n\nSelma made it so vivid that Jane saw the whole tragedy before her very\neyes.\n\n\"The real reason why they hate him,\" Selma went on, \"is because he\npreaches up education and preaches down violence--and is building his\nparty on intelligence instead of on force.  The masters want the\nworkingman who burns and kills and riots.  They can shoot him down.\nThey can make people accept any tyranny in preference to the danger of\nfire and murder let loose.  But Victor is teaching the workingmen to\nstop playing the masters' game for them.  No wonder they hate him!  He\nmakes them afraid of the day when the united workingmen will have their\nway by organizing and voting.  And they know that if Victor Dorn lives,\nthat day will come in this city very, very soon.\"  Selma saw Davy Hull,\nimpatient at his long wait, advancing toward them. She said:  \"You will\ntalk to your father?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jane.  \"And I assure you he will do what he can. You don't\nknow him, Miss Gordon.\"\n\n\"I know he loves you--I know he MUST love you,\" said Selma. \"Now, I\nmust go.  Good-by.  I knew you would be glad of the chance to do\nsomething worth while.\"\n\nJane had been rather expecting to be thanked for her generosity and\ngoodness.  Selma's remark seemed at first blush an irritating attempt\nto shift a favor asked into a favor given.  But it was impossible for\nher to fail to see Selma's sensible statement of the actual truth.  So,\nshe said honestly:\n\n\"Thank you for coming, Miss Gordon.  I am glad of the chance.\"\n\nThey shook hands.  Selma, holding her hand, looked up at her, suddenly\nkissed her.  Jane returned the kiss.  David Hull, advancing with his\ngaze upon them, stopped short.  Selma, without a glance--because\nwithout a thought--in his direction, hastened away.\n\nWhen David rejoined Jane, she was gazing tenderly after the small,\ngraceful figure moving toward the distant entrance gates. Said David:\n\n\"I think that girl has got you hypnotized.\"\n\nJane laughed and sent him home.  \"I'm busy,\" she said.  \"I've got\nsomething to do, at last.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nJane knocked at the door of her father's little office.  \"Are you\nthere, father?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes--come in, Jinny.\"  As she entered, he went on, \"But you must go\nright away again.  I've got to 'tend to this strike.\" He took on an\ninjured, melancholy tone.  \"Those fool workingmen! They're certain to\nlose.  And what'll come of it all?  Why, they'll be out their wages and\ntheir jobs, and the company lose so much money that it can't put on the\nnew cars the public's clamorin' for.  The old cars'll have to do for\nanother year, anyhow--maybe two.\"\n\nJane had heard that lugubrious tone from time to time, and she knew\nwhat it meant--an air of sorrow concealing secret joy.  So, here was\nanother benefit the company--she preferred to think of it as the\ncompany rather than as her father--expected to gain from the strike.\nIt could put off replacing the miserable old cars in which it was\ncompelling people to ride.  Instead of losing money by the strike, it\nwould make money by it.  This was Jane's first glimpse of one of the\nmost interesting and important truths of modern life--how it is often\nto the advantage of business men to have their own business crippled,\nhampered, stopped altogether.\n\n\"You needn't worry, father,\" said she cheerfully.  \"The strike's been\ndeclared off.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried her father.\n\n\"A girl from down town just called.  She says the union has called the\nstrike off and the men have accepted the company's terms.\"\n\n\"But them terms is withdrawn!\" cried Hastings, as if his daughter were\nthe union.  He seized the telephone.  \"I'll call up the office and\norder 'em withdrawn.\"\n\n\"It's too late,\" said she.\n\nJust then the telephone bell rang, and Hastings was soon hearing\nconfirmation of the news his daughter had brought him.  She could not\nbear watching his face as he listened.  She turned her back, stood\ngazing out at the window.  Her father, beside himself, was shrieking\ninto the telephone curses, denunciations, impossible orders.  The one\nemergency against which he had not provided was the union's ending the\nstrike.  When you have struck the line of battle of a general, however\nable and self-controlled, in the one spot where he has not arranged a\ndefense, you have thrown him--and his army--into a panic.  Some of the\ngreatest tactitians in history have given way in those circumstances;\nso, Martin Hastings' utter loss of self-control and of control of the\nsituation only proves that he had his share of human nature.  He had\nprovided against the unexpected; he had not provided against the\nimpossible.\n\nJane let her father rave on into the telephone until his voice grew\nhoarse and squeaky.  Then she turned and said:  \"Now, father--what's\nthe use of making yourself sick?  You can't do any good--can you?\"  She\nlaid one hand on his arm, with the other hand caressed his head.  \"Hang\nup the receiver and think of your health.\"\n\n\"I don't care to live, with such goings-on,\" declared he.  But he hung\nup the receiver and sank back in his chair, exhausted.\n\n\"Come out on the porch,\" she went on, tugging gently at him. \"The air's\nstuffy in here.\"\n\nHe rose obediently.  She led him to the veranda and seated him\ncomfortably, with a cushion in his back at the exact spot at which it\nwas most comfortable.  She patted his shrunken cheeks, stood off and\nlooked at him.\n\n\"Where's your sense of humor?\" she cried.  \"You used to be able to\nlaugh when things went against you.  You're getting to be as solemn and\nto take yourself as seriously as Davy Hull.\"\n\nThe old man made a not unsuccessful attempt to smile.  \"That there\nVictor Dorn!\" said he.  \"He'll be the death of me, yet.\"\n\n\"What has he done now?\" said Jane, innocently.\n\nHastings rubbed his big bald forehead with his scrawny hand. \"He's\ntryin' to run this town--to run it to the devil,\" replied he, by way of\nevasion.\n\n\"Something's got to be done about him--eh?\" observed she, in a fine\nimitation of a business-like voice.\n\n\"Something WILL be done,\" retorted he.\n\nJane winced--hid her distress--returned to the course she had mapped\nout for herself.  \"I hope it won't be something stupid,\" said she.\nThen she seated herself and went on.  \"Father--did you ever stop to\nwonder whether it is Victor Dorn or the changed times?\"\n\nThe old man looked up abruptly and sharply--the expression of a shrewd\nman when he catches a hint of a new idea that sounds as if it might\nhave something in it.\n\n\"You blame Victor Dorn,\" she went on to explain.  \"But if there were no\nVictor Dorn, wouldn't you be having just the same trouble?  Aren't men\nof affairs having them everywhere--in Europe as well as on this\nside--nowadays?\"\n\nThe old man rubbed his brow--his nose--his chin--pulled at the tufts of\nhair in his ears--fumbled with his cuffs.  All of these gestures\nindicated interest and attention.\n\n\"Isn't the real truth not Victor Dorn or Victor Dorns but a changed and\nchanging world?\" pursued the girl.  \"And if that's so, haven't you\neither got to adopt new methods or fall back? That's the way it looks\nto me--and we women have got intuitions if we haven't got sense.\"\n\n\"_I_ never said women hadn't got sense,\" replied the old man. \"I've\nsometimes said MEN ain't got no sense, but not women.  Not to go no\nfurther, the women make the men work for 'em--don't they?  THAT'S a\npretty good quality of sense, _I_ guess.\"\n\nBut she knew he was busily thinking all the time about what she had\nsaid.  So she did not hesitate to go on:  \"Instead of helping Victor\nDorn by giving him things to talk about, it seems to me I'd USE him,\nfather.\"\n\n\"Can't do anything with him.  He's crazy,\" declared Hastings.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" replied Jane.  \"I don't believe he's crazy.  And\nI don't believe you can't manage him.  A man like that--a man as clever\nas he is--doesn't belong with a lot of ignorant tenement-house people.\nHe's out of place.  And when anything or anybody is out of place, they\ncan be put in their right place.  Isn't that sense?\"\n\nThe old man shook his head--not in negation, but in uncertainty.\n\n\"These men are always edging you on against Victor Dorn--what's the\nmatter with them?\" pursued Jane.  \"_I_ saw, when Davy Hull talked about\nhim.  They're envious and jealous of him, father. They're afraid he'll\ndistance them.  And they don't want you to realize what a useful man he\ncould be--how he could help you if you helped him--made friends with\nhim--roused the right kind of ambition in him.\"\n\n\"When a man's ambitious,\" observed Hastings, out of the fullness of his\nown personal experience, \"it means he's got something inside him,\nteasing and nagging  at him--something that won't let him rest, but\nkeeps pushing and pulling--and he's got to keep fighting, trying to\nsatisfy it--and he can't wait to pick his ground or his weapons.\"\n\n\"And Victor Dorn,\" said Jane, to make it clearer to her father by\nputting his implied thought into words, \"Victor Dorn is doing the best\nhe can--fighting on the only ground that offers and with the only\nweapons he can lay hands on.\"\n\nThe old man nodded.  \"I never have blamed him--not really,\" declared\nhe.  \"A practical man--a man that's been through things--he understands\nhow these things are,\" in the tone of a philosopher.  \"Yes, I reckon\nVictor's doing the best he can--getting up by the only ladder he's got\na chance at.\"\n\n\"The way to get him off that ladder is to give him another,\" said Jane.\n\nA long silence, the girl letting her father thresh the matter out in\nhis slow, thorough way.  Finally her young impatience conquered her\nrestraint.  \"Well--what do you think, popsy?\" inquired she.\n\n\"That I've got about as smart a gel as there is in Remsen City,\"\nreplied he.\n\n\"Don't lay it on too thick,\" laughed she.\n\nHe understood why she was laughing, though he did not show it. He knew\nwhat his much-traveled daughter thought of Remsen City, but he held to\nhis own provincial opinion, nevertheless.  Nor, perhaps, was he so far\nwrong as she believed.  A cross section of human society, taken almost\nanywhere, will reveal about the same quantity of brain, and the quality\nof the mill is the thing, not of the material it may happen to be\ngrinding.\n\nShe understood that his remark was his way of letting her know that he\nhad taken her suggestion under advisement.  This meant that she had\nsaid enough.  And Jane Hastings had made herself an adept in the art of\nhandling her father--an accomplishment she could by no means have\nachieved had she not loved him; it is only when a woman deeply and\nstrongly loves a man that she can learn to influence him, for only love\ncan put the necessary sensitiveness into the nerves with which moods\nand prejudices and whims and such subtle uncertainties can be felt out.\n\nThe next day but one, coming out on the front veranda a few minutes\nbefore lunch time she was startled rather than surprised to see Victor\nDorn seated on a wicker sofa, hat off and gaze wandering delightedly\nover the extensive view of the beautiful farming country round Remsen\nCity.  She paused in the doorway to take advantage of the chance to\nlook at him when he was off his guard.  Certainly that profile view of\nthe young man was impressive.  It is only in the profile that we get a\nchance to measure the will or propelling force behind a character.  In\neach of the two main curves of Dorn's head--that from the top of the\nbrow downward over the nose, the lips, the chin and under, and that\nfrom the back of the head round under the ear and forward along the\nlower jaw--in each of these curves Dorn excelled.\n\nShe was about to draw back and make a formal entry, when he said,\nwithout looking toward her:\n\n\"Well--don't you think it would be safe to draw near?\"\n\nThe tone was so easy and natural and so sympathetic--the tone of Selma\nGordon--the tone of all natural persons not disturbed about themselves\nor about others--that Jane felt no embarrassment whatever.  \"I've heard\nyou were very clever,\" said she, advancing.  \"So, I wanted to have the\nadvantage of knowing you a little better at the outset than you would\nknow me.\"\n\n\"But Selma Gordon has told me all about you,\" said he--he had risen as\nshe advanced and was shaking hands with her as if they were old\nfriends.  \"Besides, I saw you the other day--in spite of your effort to\nprevent yourself from being seen.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, completely mystified.\n\n\"I mean your clothes,\" explained he.  \"They were unusual for this part\nof the world.  And when anyone wears unusual clothes, they act as a\ndisguise.  Everyone neglects the person to center on the clothes.\"\n\n\"I wore them to be comfortable,\" protested Jane, wondering why she was\nnot angry at this young man whose manner ought to be regarded as\npresuming and whose speech ought to be rebuked as impertinent.\n\n\"Altogether?\" said Dorn, his intensely blue eyes dancing.\n\nIn spite of herself she smiled.  \"No--not altogether,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Well, it may please you to learn that you scored tremendously as far\nas one person is concerned.  My small nephew talks of you all the\ntime--the 'lady in the lovely pants.'\"\n\nJane colored deeply and angrily.  She bent upon Victor a glance that\nought to have put him in his place--well down in his place.\n\nBut he continued to look at her with unchanged, laughing, friendly blue\neyes, and went on:  \"By the way, his mother asked me to apologize for\nHIS extraordinary appearance.  I suppose neither of you would recognize\nthe other in any dress but the one each had on that day.  He doesn't\nalways dress that way.  His mother has been ill.  He wore out his\nplay-clothes.  If you've had experience of children you'll know how\nsuddenly they demolish clothes.  She wasn't well enough to do any\ntailoring, so there was nothing to do but send Leonard forth in his big\nbrother's unchanged cast-offs.\"\n\nJane's anger had quite passed away before Dorn finished this simple,\ningenuous recital of poverty unashamed, this somehow fine laying open\nof the inmost family secrets.  \"What a splendid person your sister must\nbe!\" exclaimed she.\n\nShe more than liked the look that now came into his face.  He said:\n\"Indeed she is!--more so than anyone except us of the family can\nrealize.  Mother's getting old and almost helpless. My brother-in-law\nwas paralyzed by an accident at the rolling mill where he worked.  My\nsister takes care of both of them--and her two boys--and of me--keeps\nthe house in band-box order, manages a big garden that gives us most of\nwhat we eat--and has time to listen to the woes of all the neighbors\nand to give them the best advice I ever heard.\"\n\n\"How CAN she?\" cried Jane.  \"Why, the day isn't long enough.\"\n\nDorn laughed.  \"You'll never realize how much time there is in a day,\nMiss Jane Hastings, until you try to make use of it all. It's very\ninteresting--how much there is in a minute and in a dollar if you're\nintelligent about them.\"\n\nJane looked at him in undisguised wonder and admiration.  \"You don't\nknow what a pleasure it is,\" she said, \"to meet anyone whose sentences\nyou couldn't finish for him before he's a quarter the way through them.\"\n\nVictor threw back his head and laughed--a boyish outburst that would\nhave seemed boorish in another, but came as naturally from him as song\nfrom a bird.  \"You mean Davy Hull,\" said he.\n\nJane felt herself coloring even more.  \"I didn't mean him especially,\"\nreplied she.  \"But he's a good example.\"\n\n\"The best I know,\" declared Victor.  \"You see, the trouble with Davy is\nthat he is one kind of a person, wants to be another kind, thinks he\nought to be a third kind, and believes he fools people into thinking he\nis still a fourth kind.\"\n\nJane reflected on this, smiled understandingly.  \"That sounds like a\ndescription of ME,\" said she.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Victor.  \"It's a very usual type in the second\ngeneration in your class.\"\n\n\"My class?\" said Jane, somewhat affectedly.  \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The upper class,\" explained Victor.\n\nJane felt that this was an opportunity for a fine exhibition of her\ndemocracy.  \"I don't like that,\" said she.  \"I'm a good American, and I\ndon't believe in classes.  I don't feel--at least I try not to\nfeel--any sense of inequality between myself and those--those\nless--less--fortunately off.  I'm not expressing myself well, but you\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what you mean,\" rejoined Victor.  \"But that wasn't what I\nmeant, at all.  You are talking about social classes in the narrow\nsense.  That sort of thing isn't important. One associates with the\nkind of people that pleases one--and one has a perfect right to do so.\nIf I choose to have my leisure time with people who dress a certain\nway, or with those who have more than a certain amount of money, or\nmore than a certain number of servants or what not--why, that's my own\nlookout.\"\n\n\"I'm SO glad to hear you say that,\" cried Jane.  \"That's SO sensible.\"\n\n\"Snobbishness may be amusing,\" continued Dorn, \"or it may be\nrepulsive--or pitiful.  But it isn't either interesting or important.\nThe classes I had in mind were the economic classes--upper, middle,\nlower.  The upper class includes all those who live without\nwork--aristocrats, gamblers, thieves, preachers, women living off men\nin or out of marriage, grown children living off their parents or off\ninheritances.  All the idlers.\"\n\nJane looked almost as uncomfortable as she felt.  She had long taken a\nsecret delight in being regarded and spoken of as an \"upper class\"\nperson.  Henceforth this delight would be at least alloyed.\n\n\"The middle class,\" pursued Victor, \"is those who are in part parasites\nand in part workers.  The lower class is those who live by what they\nearn only.  For example, you are upper class, your father is middle\nclass and I am lower class.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Jane demurely, \"for an interesting lesson in\npolitical economy.\"\n\n\"You invited it,\" laughed Victor.  \"And I guess it wasn't much more\ntiresome to you than talk about the weather would have been. The\nweather's probably about the only other subject you and I have in\ncommon.\"\n\n\"That's rude,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Not as I meant it,\" said he.  \"I wasn't exalting my subjects or\nsneering at yours.  It's obvious that you and I lead wholly different\nlives.\"\n\n\"I'd much rather lead your life than my own,\" said Jane. \"But--you are\nimpatient to see father.  You came to see him?\"\n\n\"He telephoned asking me to come to dinner--that is, lunch.  I believe\nit's called lunch when it's second in this sort of house.\"\n\n\"Father calls it dinner, and I call it lunch, and the servants call it\nIT.  They simply say, 'It's ready.'\"\n\nJane went in search of her father, found him asleep in his chair in the\nlittle office, one of his dirty little account books clasped in his\nlong, thin fingers with their rheumatic side curve.  The maid had seen\nhim there and had held back dinner until he should awaken.  Perhaps\nJane's entrance roused him; or, perhaps it was the odor of the sachet\npowder wherewith her garments were liberally scented, for he had a\nsingularly delicate sense of smell.  He lifted his head and, after the\nmanner of aged and confirmed cat-nappers, was instantly wide awake.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me Victor Dorn was coming for dinner?\" said she.\n\n\"Oh--he's here, is he?\" said Hastings, chuckling.  \"You see I took your\nadvice.  Tell Lizzie to lay an extra plate.\"\n\nHastings regarded this invitation as evidence of his breadth of mind,\nhis freedom from prejudice, his disposition to do the generous and the\nhelpful thing.  In fact, it was evidence of little more than his\ndominant and most valuable trait--his shrewdness.  After one careful\nglance over the ruins of his plan, he appreciated that Victor Dorn was\nat last a force to be reckoned with.  He had been growing,\ngrowing--somewhat above the surface, a great deal more beneath the\nsurface.  His astonishing victory demonstrated his power over Remsen\nCity labor--in a single afternoon he had persuaded the street car union\nto give up without hesitation a strike it had been planning--at least,\nit thought it had been doing the planning--for months.  The Remsen City\nplutocracy was by no means dependent upon the city government of Remsen\nCity.  It had the county courts--the district courts--the State courts\neven, except where favoring the plutocracy would be too obviously\noutrageous for judges who still considered themselves men of honest and\njust mind to decide that way.  The plutocracy, further, controlled all\nthe legislative and executive machinery.  To dislodge it from these\nfortresses would mean a campaign of years upon years, conducted by men\nof the highest ability, and enlisting a majority of the voters of the\nState.  Still, possession of the Remsen City government was a most\nvaluable asset.  A hostile government could \"upset business,\" could\n\"hamper the profitable investment of capital,\" in other words could\nestablish justice to a highly uncomfortable degree.  This victory of\nDorn's made it clear to Hastings that at last Dorn was about to unite\nthe labor vote under his banner--which meant that he was about to\nconquer the city government.  It was high time to stop him and, if\npossible, to give his talents better employment.\n\nHowever, Hastings, after the familiar human fashion, honestly thought\nhe was showing generosity, was going out of his way to \"give a likely\nyoung fellow a chance.\"  When he came out on the veranda he stretched\nforth a graciously friendly hand and, looking shrewdly into Victor's\nboyishly candid eyes, said:\n\n\"Glad to see you, young man.  I want to thank you for ending that\nstrike.  I was born a working man, and I've been one all my life and,\nwhen I can't work any more, I want to quit the earth. So, being a\nworking man, I hate to see working men make fools of themselves.\"\n\nJane was watching the young man anxiously.  She instinctively knew that\nthis speech must be rousing his passion for plain and direct speaking.\nBefore he had time to answer she said: \"Dinner's waiting.  Let's go in.\"\n\nAnd on the way she made an opportunity to say to him in an undertone:\n\"I do hope you'll be careful not to say anything that'll upset father.\nI have to warn every one who comes here. His digestion's bad, and the\nleast thing makes him ill, and--\" she smiled charmingly at him--\"I HATE\nnursing.  It's too much like work to suit an upper-class person.\"\n\nThere was no resisting such an appeal as that.  Victor sat silent and\nate, and let the old man talk on and on.  Jane saw that it was a severe\ntrial to him to seem to be assenting to her father's views.  Whenever\nhe showed signs of casting off his restraint, she gave him a pleading\nglance.  And the old man, so weazened, so bent and shaky, with his bowl\nof crackers and milk, was--or seemed to be--proof that the girl was\nasking of him only what was humane.  Jane relieved the situation by\ntalking volubly about herself--her college experiences, what she had\nseen and done in Europe.\n\nAfter dinner Hastings said:\n\n\"I'll drive you back to town, young man.  I'm going in to work, as\nusual.  I never took a vacation in my life.  Can you beat that record?\"\n\n\"Oh, I knock off every once in a while for a month or so,\" said Dorn.\n\n\"The young fellows growing up nowadays ain't equal to us of the old\nstock,\" said Martin.  \"They can't stand the strain.  Well, if you're\nready, we'll pull out.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dorn's going to stop a while with me, father,\" interposed Jane\nwith a significant glance at Victor.  \"I want to show him the grounds\nand the views.\"\n\n\"All right--all right,\" said her father.  He never liked company in his\ndrives; company interfered with his thinking out what he was going to\ndo at the office.  \"I'm mighty glad to know you, young man.  I hope\nwe'll know each other better.  I think you'll find out that for a devil\nI'm not half bad--eh?\"\n\nVictor bowed, murmured something inarticulate, shook his host's hand,\nand when the ceremony of parting was over drew a stealthy breath of\nrelief--which Jane observed.  She excused herself to accompany her\nfather to his trap.  As he was climbing in she said:\n\n\"Didn't you rather like him, father?\"\n\nOld Hastings gathered the reins in his lean, distorted hands. \"So so,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"He's got brains, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes; he's smart; mighty smart.\"  The old man's face relaxed in a\nshrewd grin.  \"Too damn smart.  Giddap, Bet.\"\n\nAnd he was gone.  Jane stood looking after the ancient phaeton with an\nexpression half of amusement, half of discomfiture.  \"I might have\nknown,\" reflected she, \"that popsy would see through it all.\"\n\nWhen she reappeared in the front doorway Victor Dorn was at the edge of\nthe veranda, ready to depart.  As soon as he saw her he said gravely:\n\"I must be off, Miss Hastings.  Thank you for the very interesting\ndinner.\"  He extended his hand.  \"Good day.\"\n\nShe put her hands behind her back, and stood smiling gently at him.\n\"You mustn't go--not just yet.  I'm about to show you the trees and the\ngrass, the bees, the chickens and the cows.  Also, I've something\nimportant to say to you.\"\n\nHe shook his head.  \"I'm sorry, but I must go.\"\n\nShe stiffened slightly; her smile changed from friendly to cold.\n\"Oh--pardon me,\" she said.  \"Good-by.\"\n\nHe bowed, and was on the walk, and running rapidly toward the entrance\ngates.\n\n\"Mr. Dorn!\" she called.\n\nHe turned.\n\nShe was afraid to risk asking him to come back for a moment.  He might\nrefuse.  Standing there, looking so resolute, so completely master of\nhimself, so devoid of all suggestion of need for any one or anything,\nhe seemed just the man to turn on his heel and depart.  She descended\nto the walk and went to him.  She said:\n\n\"Why are you acting so peculiarly?  Why did you come?\"\n\n\"Because I understood that your father wished to propose some changes\nin the way of better hours and better wages for the men,\" replied he.\n\"I find that the purpose was--not that.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"I do not care to go into that.\"\n\nHe was about to go on--on out of her life forever, she felt. \"Wait,\"\nshe cried.  \"The men will get better hours and wages. You don't\nunderstand father's ways.  He was really discussing that very thing--in\nhis own mind.  You'll see.  He has a great admiration for you.  You can\ndo a lot with him.  You owe it to the men to make use of his liking.\"\n\nHe looked at her in silence for a moment.  Then he said:  \"I'll have to\nbe at least partly frank with you.  In all his life no one has ever\ngotten anything out of your father.  He uses men. They do not use him.\"\n\n\"Believe me, that is unjust,\" cried Jane.  \"I'll tell you another thing\nthat was on his mind.  He wants to--to make reparation for--that\naccident to your father.  He wants to pay your mother and you the money\nthe road didn't pay you when it ought.\"\n\nDorn's candid face showed how much he was impressed.  This beautiful,\nearnest girl, sweet and frank, seemed herself to be another view of\nMartin Hastings' character--one more in accord with her strong belief\nin the essential goodness of human nature.\n\nSaid he:  \"Your father owes us nothing.  As for the road--its debt\nnever existed legally--only morally.  And it has been outlawed long\nago--for there's a moral statute of limitations, too.  The best thing\nthat ever happened to us was our not getting that money.  It put us on\nour mettle.  It might have crushed us. It happened to be just the thing\nthat was needed to make us.\"\n\nJane marveled at this view of his family, at the verge of poverty, as\nsuccessful.  But she could not doubt his sincerity. Said she sadly,\n\"But it's not to the credit of the road--or of father.  He must\npay--and he knows he must.\"\n\n\"We can't accept,\" said Dorn--a finality.\n\n\"But you could use it to build up the paper,\" urged Jane, to detain him.\n\n\"The paper was started without money.  It lives without money--and it\nwill go on living without money, or it ought to die.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Jane.  \"But I want to understand. I want to\nhelp.  Won't you let me?\"\n\nHe shook his head laughingly.  \"Help what?\" inquired he. \"Help raise\nthe sun?  It doesn't need help.\"\n\nJane began to see.  \"I mean, I want to be helped,\" she cried.\n\n\"Oh, that's another matter,\" said he.  \"And very simple.\"\n\n\"Will YOU help me?\"\n\n\"I can't.  No one can.  You've got to help yourself.  Each one of us is\nworking for himself--working not to be rich or to be famous or to be\nenvied, but to be free.\"\n\n\"Working for himself--that sounds selfish, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"If you are wise, Jane Hastings,\" said Dorn, \"you will\ndistrust--disbelieve in--anything that is not selfish.\"\n\nJane reflected.  \"Yes--I see,\" she cried.  \"I never thought of that!\"\n\n\"A friend of mine, Wentworth,\" Victor went on, \"has put it wonderfully\nclearly.  He said, 'Some day we shall realize that no man can be free\nuntil all men are free.'\"\n\n\"You HAVE helped me--in spite of your fierce refusal,\" laughed Jane.\n\"You are very impatient to go, aren't you?  Well, since you won't stay\nI'll walk with you--as far as the end of the shade.\"\n\nShe was slightly uneasy lest her overtures should be misunderstood.  By\nthe time they reached the first long, sunny stretch of the road down to\ntown she was so afraid that those overtures would not be\n\"misunderstood\" that she marched on beside him in the hot sun.  She did\nnot leave him until they reached the corner of Pike avenue--and then it\nwas he that left her, for she could cudgel out no excuse for going\nfurther in his direction.  The only hold she had got upon him for a\nfuture attempt was slight indeed--he had vaguely agreed to lend her\nsome books.\n\nPeople who have nothing to do get rid of a great deal of time in trying\nto make impressions and in speculating as to what impressions they have\nmade.  Jane--hastening toward Martha's to get out of the sun which\ncould not but injure a complexion so delicately fine as hers--gave\nherself up to this form of occupation.  What did he think of her?  Did\nhe really have as little sense of her physical charm as he seemed?  No\nwoman could hope to be attractive to every man.  Still--this man surely\nmust be at least not altogether insensible.  \"If he sends me those\nbooks to-day--or tomorrow--or even next day,\" thought Jane, \"it will be\na pretty sure sign that he was impressed--whether he knows it or not.\"\n\nShe had now definitely passed beyond the stage where she wondered at\nherself--and reproached herself--for wishing to win a man of such\ncommon origin and surroundings.  She could not doubt Victor Dorn's\nsuperiority.  Such a man as that didn't need birth or wealth or even\nfame.  He simply WAS the man worth while--worth any woman's while.  How\ncould Selma be associated so intimately with him without trying to get\nhim in love with her?  Perhaps she had tried and had given up?\nNo--Selma was as strange in her way as he was in his way.  What a\nstrange--original--INDIVIDUAL pair they were!\n\n\"But,\" concluded Jane, \"he belongs with US.  I must take him away from\nall that.  It will be interesting to do it--so interesting that I'll be\nsorry when it's done, and I'll be looking about for something else to\ndo.\"\n\nShe was not without hope that the books would come that same evening.\nBut they did not.  The next day passed, and the next, and still no\nbooks.  Apparently he had meant nothing by his remark, \"I've some books\nyou'd be interested to read.\"  Was his silence indifference, or was it\nshyness?  Probably she could only faintly appreciate the effect her\nposition, her surroundings produced in this man whose physical\nsurroundings had always been as poor as her mental surroundings--those\ncreated by that marvelous mind of his--had been splendid.\n\nShe tried to draw out her father on the subject of the young man, with\na view to getting a hint as to whether he purposed doing anything\nfurther.  But old Hastings would not talk about it; he was still\ndebating, was looking at the matter from a standpoint where his\ndaughter's purely theoretical acumen could not help him to a decision.\nJane rather feared that where her father was evidently so doubtful he\nwould follow his invariable rule in doubtful cases.\n\nOn the fourth day, being still unable to think of anything but her\nproject for showing her prowess by conquering this man with no time for\nwomen, she donned a severely plain walking costume and went to his\noffice.\n\nAt the threshold of the \"Sanctum\" she stopped short.  Selma, pencil\npoised over her block of copy paper and every indication of impatience,\nalbeit polite impatience, in her fascinating Cossack face, was talking\nto--or, rather, listening to--David Hull.  Like not a few young\nmen--and young women--brought up in circumstances that surround them\nwith people deferential for the sake of what there is, or may possibly\nbe, in it--Davy Hull had the habit of assuming that all the world was\nas fond of listening to him as he was of listening to himself.  So it\ndid not often occur to him to observe his audience for signs of a\nwillingness to end the conversation.\n\nSelma, turning a little further in her nervousness, saw Jane and sprang\nup with a radiant smile of welcome.\n\n\"I'm SO glad!\" she cried, rushing toward her and kissing her. \"I've\nthought about you often, and wished I could find time to come to see\nyou.\"\n\nJane was suddenly as delighted as Selma.  For Selma's burst of\nfriendliness, so genuine, so unaffected, in this life of blackness and\ncold always had the effect of sun suddenly making summer out of a chill\nautumnal day.  Nor, curiously enough, was her delight lessened by Davy\nHull's blundering betrayal of himself.  His color, his eccentric\ntwitchings of the lips and the hands would have let a far less astute\nyoung woman than Jane Hastings into the secret of the reason for his\npresence in that office when he had said he couldn't \"afford\" to go.\nSo guilty did he feel that he stammered out:\n\n\"I dropped in to see Dorn.\"\n\n\"You wished to see Victor?\" exclaimed the guileless Selma. \"Why didn't\nyou say so?  I'd have told you at once that he was in Indianapolis and\nwouldn't be back for two or three days.\"\n\nJane straightway felt still better.  The disgusting mystery of the\nbooks that did not come was now cleared up.  Secure in the certainty of\nSelma's indifference to Davy she proceeded to punish him.  \"What a\nstupid you are, Davy!\" she cried mockingly. \"The instant I saw your\nface I knew you were here to flirt with Miss Gordon.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Miss Hastings,\" protested Selma with quaint intensity of\nseriousness, \"I assure you he was not flirting.  He was telling me\nabout the reform movement he and his friends are organizing.\"\n\n\"That is his way of flirting,\" said Jane.  \"Every animal has its own\nway--and an elephant's way is different from a mosquito's.\"\n\nSelma was eyeing Hull dubiously.  It was bad enough for him to have\ntaken her time in a well-meaning attempt to enlighten her as to a new\nphase of local politics; to take her time, to waste it, in\nflirting--that was too exasperating!\n\n\"Miss Hastings has a sense of humor that runs riot at times,\" said Hull.\n\n\"You can't save yourself, Davy,\" mocked Jane.  \"Come along. Miss Gordon\nhas no time for either of us.\"\n\n\"I do want YOU to stay,\" she said to Jane.  \"But, unfortunately, with\nVictor away----\"  She looked disconsolately at the half-finished page\nof copy.\n\n\"I came only to snatch Davy away,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Next thing we know, he'll be one of Mr. Dorn's lieutenants.\"\n\nThus Jane escaped without having to betray why she had come.  In the\nstreet she kept up her raillery.  \"And a WORKING girl, Davy! What would\nour friends say!  And you who are always boasting of your\nfastidiousness!  Flirting with a girl who--I've seen her three times,\nand each time she has had on exactly the same plain, cheap little\ndress.\"\n\nThere was a nastiness, a vulgarity in this that was as unworthy of Jane\nas are all the unlovely emotions of us who are always sweet and refined\nwhen we are our true selves--but have a bad habit of only too often not\nbeing what we flatter ourselves is our true selves.  Jane was growing\nangry as she, away from Selma, resumed her normal place in the world\nand her normal point of view.  Davy Hull belonged to her; he had no\nright to be hanging about another, anyway--especially an attractive\nwoman.  Her anger was not lessened by Davy's retort.  Said he:\n\n\"Her dress may have been the same.  But her face wasn't--and her mind\nwasn't.  Those things are more difficult to change than a dress.\"\n\nShe was so angry that she did not take warning from this reminder that\nDavy was by no means merely a tedious retailer of stale commonplaces.\nShe said with fine irony--and with no show of anger:  \"It is always a\nshock to a lady to realize how coarse men are--how they don't\ndiscriminate.\"\n\nDavy laughed.  \"Women get their rank from men,\" said he coolly.\n\n\"In themselves they have none.  That's the philosophy of the\npeculiarity you've noted.\"\n\nThis truth, so galling to a lady, silenced Jane, made her bite her lips\nwith rage.  \"I beg your pardon,\" she finally said. \"I didn't realize\nthat you were in love with Selma.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am in love with her,\" was Davy's astounding reply. \"She's the\nnoblest and simplest creature I've ever met.\"\n\n\"You don't mean you want to marry her!\" exclaimed Jane, so amazed that\nshe for the moment lost sight of her own personal interest in this\naffair.\n\nDavy looked at her sadly, and a little contemptuously.\n\n\"What a poor opinion at bottom you women--your sort of women--have of\nwoman,\" said he.\n\n\"What a poor opinion of men you mean,\" retorted she.  \"After a little\nexperience of them a girl--even a girl--learns that they are incapable\nof any emotion that isn't gross.\"\n\n\"Don't be so ladylike, Jane,\" said Hull.\n\nMiss Hastings was recovering control of herself.  She took a new tack.\n\"You haven't asked her yet?\"\n\n\"Hardly.  This is the second time I've seen her.  I suspected that she\nwas the woman for me the moment I saw her.  To-day I confirmed my idea.\nShe is all that I thought--and more.  And, Jane, I know that you\nappreciate her, too.\"\n\nJane now saw that Davy was being thus abruptly and speedily confiding\nbecause he had decided it was the best way out of his entanglement with\nher.  Behind his coolness she could see an uneasy watchfulness--the\nfear that she might try to hold him.  Up boiled her rage--the higher\nbecause she knew that if there were any possible way of holding Davy,\nshe would take it--not because she wished to, or would, marry him, but\nbecause she had put her mark upon him.  But this new rage was of the\nkind a clever woman has small difficulty in dissembling.\n\n\"Indeed I do appreciate her, Davy,\" said she sweetly.  \"And I hope you\nwill be happy with her.\"\n\n\"You think I can get her?\" said he, fatuously eager.  \"You think she\nlikes me?  I've been rather hoping that because it seized me so\nsuddenly and so powerfully it must have seized her, too.  I think often\nthings occur that way.\"\n\n\"In novels,\" said Jane, pleasantly judicial.  \"But in real life about\nthe hardest thing to do is for a man to make a woman care for\nhim--really care for him.\"\n\n\"Well, no matter how hard I have to try----\"\n\n\"Of course,\" pursued Miss Hastings, ignoring his interruption, \"when a\nman who has wealth and position asks a woman who hasn't to marry him,\nshe usually accepts--unless he happens to be downright repulsive, or\nshe happens to be deeply and hopefully in love with another man.\"\n\nDavy winced satisfactorily.  \"Do you suspect,\" he presently asked,\n\"that she's in love with Victor Dorn?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Jane reflectively.  \"Probably.  But I'd not feel\ndiscouraged by that if I were you.\"\n\n\"Dorn's a rather attractive chap in some ways.\"\n\nDavy's manner was so superior that Jane almost laughed in his face.\nWhat fools men were.  If Victor Dorn had position, weren't surrounded\nby his unquestionably, hopelessly common family, weren't deliberately\nkeeping himself common--was there a woman in the world who wouldn't\nchoose him without a second thought being necessary, in preference to a\nDavy Hull?  How few men there were who could reasonably hope to hold\ntheir women against all comers.\n\nVictor Dorn might possibly be of those few.  But Davy Hull--the idea\nwas ridiculous.  All his advantages--height, looks, money,\nposition--were excellent qualities in a show piece; but they weren't\nthe qualities that make a woman want to live her life with a man, that\nmake her hope he will be able to give her the emotions woman-nature\ncraves beyond anything.\n\n\"He is very attractive,\" said Jane, \"and I've small doubt that Selma\nGordon is infatuated with him.  But--I shouldn't let that worry me if I\nwere you.\"  She paused to enjoy his anxiety, then proceeded:  \"She is a\nlevel-headed girl.  The girls of the working class--the intelligent\nones--have had the silly sentimentalities knocked out of them by\nexperience.  So, when you ask her to marry you, she will accept.\"\n\n\"What a low opinion you have of her!\" exclaimed Davy.  \"What a low view\nyou take of life!\"--most inconsistent of him, since he was himself more\nthan half convinced that Jane's observations were not far from the\ntruth.\n\n\"Women are sensible,\" said Jane tranquilly.  \"They appreciate that\nthey've got to get a man to support them.  Don't forget, my dear Davy,\nthat marriage is a woman's career.\"\n\n\"You lived abroad too long,\" said Hull bitterly.\n\n\"I've lived at home and abroad long enough and intelligently enough not\nto think stupid hypocrisies, even if I do sometimes imitate other\npeople and SAY them.\"\n\n\"I am sure that Selma Gordon would no more think of marrying me for any\nother reason but love--would no more think of it than--than YOU would!\"\n\n\"No more,\" was Jane's unruffled reply.  \"But just as much.  I didn't\nabsolutely refuse you, when you asked me the other day, partly because\nI saw no other way of stopping your tiresome talk--and your\nunattractive way of trying to lay hands on me.  I DETEST being handled.\"\n\nDavy was looking so uncomfortable that he attracted the attention of\nthe people they were passing in wide, shady Lincoln Avenue.\n\n\"But my principal reason,\" continued Jane, mercilessly amiable and\ncandid, \"was that I didn't know but that you might prove to be about\nthe best I could get, as a means to realizing my ambition.\"  She looked\nlaughingly at the unhappy young man. \"You didn't think I was in love\nwith you, did you, Davy dear?\" Then, while the confusion following this\nblow was at its height, she added:  \"You'll remember one of your chief\narguments for my accepting you was ambition.  You didn't think it low\nthen--did you?\"\n\nHull was one of the dry-skinned people.  But if he had been sweating\nprofusely he would have looked and would have been less wretched than\nburning up in the smothered heat of his misery.\n\nThey were nearing Martha's gates.  Jane said:  \"Yes, Davy, you've got a\ngood chance.  And as soon as she gets used to our way of living, she'll\nmake you a good wife.\"  She laughed gayly.\n\n\"She'll not be quite so pretty when she settles down and takes on\nflesh.  I wonder how she'll look in fine clothes and jewels.\"\n\nShe measured Hull's stature with a critical eye.  \"She's only about\nhalf as tall as you.  How funny you'll look together!\" With sudden\nsoberness and sweetness, \"But, seriously, David, I'm proud of your\ncourage in taking a girl for herself regardless of her surroundings.\nSo few men would be willing to face the ridicule and the criticism, and\nall the social difficulties.\" She nodded encouragingly.  \"Go in and\nwin!  You can count on my friendship--for I'm in love with her myself.\"\n\nShe left him standing dazedly, looking up and down the street as if it\nwere some strange and pine-beset highway in a foreign land.\n\nAfter taking a few steps she returned to the gates and called him:  \"I\nforgot to ask do you want me to regard what you've told me as\nconfidential?  I was thinking of telling Martha and Hugo, and it\noccurred to me that you might not like it.\"\n\n\"Please don't say anything about it,\" said he with panicky eagerness.\n\"You see--nothing's settled yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, she'll accept you.\"\n\n\"But I haven't even asked her,\" pleaded Hull.\n\n\"Oh--all right--as you please.\"\n\nWhen she was safely within doors she dropped to a chair and burst out\nlaughing.  It was part of Jane's passion for the sense of triumph over\nthe male sex to felt that she had made a \"perfect jumping jack of a\nfool\" of David Hull.  \"And I rather think,\" said she to herself, \"that\nhe'll soon be back where he belongs.\"  This with a glance at the tall\nheels of the slippers on the good-looking feet she was thrusting out\nfor her own inspection.  \"How absurd for him to imagine he could do\nanything unconventional.  Is there any coward anywhere so cowardly as\nan American conventional man?  No wonder I hate to think of marrying\none of them.  But--I suppose I'll have to do it some day.  What's a\nwoman to do?  She's GOT to marry.\"\n\nSo pleased with herself was she that she behaved with unusual\nforbearance toward Martha whose conduct of late had been most trying.\nNot Martha's sometimes peevish, sometimes plaintive criticisms of her;\nthese she did not mind.  But Martha's way of ordering her own life.\nJane, moving about in the world with a good mind eager to improve, had\ngot a horror of a woman's going to pieces--and that was what Martha was\ndoing.\n\n\"I'm losing my looks rapidly,\" was her constant complaint.  As she had\njust passed thirty there was, in Jane's opinion, not the smallest\nexcuse for this.  The remedy, the preventive, was obvious--diet and\nexercise.  But Martha, being lazy and self-indulgent and not\nimaginative enough to foresee to what a pass a few years more of\nlounging and stuffing would bring her, regarded exercise as unladylike\nand dieting as unhealthful.  She would not weaken her system by taking\nless than was demanded by \"nature's infallible guide, the healthy\nappetite.\"  She would not give up the venerable and aristocratic\ntradition that a lady should ever be reposeful.\n\n\"Another year or so,\" warned Jane, \"and you'll be as steatopygous as\nthe bride of a Hottentot chief.\"\n\n\"What does steat--that word mean?\" said Martha suspiciously.\n\n\"Look in the dictionary,\" said Jane.  \"Its synonyms aren't used by\nrefined people.\"\n\n\"I knew it was something insulting,\" said Martha with an injured sniff.\n\nThe only concessions Martha would make to the latter-day craze of women\nfor youthfulness were buying a foolish chin-strap of a beauty quack and\nconsulting him as to whether, if her hair continued to gray, she would\nbetter take to peroxide or to henna.\n\nJane had come down that day with a severe lecture on fat and wrinkles\nlaid out in her mind for energetic delivery to the fast-seeding Martha.\nShe put off the lecture and allowed the time to be used by Martha in\ntelling Jane what were her (Jane's) strongest and less strong--not\nweaker but less strong, points of physical charm.\n\nIt was cool and beautiful in the shade of the big gardens behind the\nold Galland house.  Jane, listening to Martha's honest and just\ncompliments and to the faint murmurs of the city's dusty, sweaty toil,\nhad a delicious sense of the superiority of her lot--a feeling that\nsomehow there must be something in the theory of rightfully superior\nand inferior classes--that in taking what she had not earned she was\nnot robbing those who had earned it, as her reason so often asserted,\nbut was being supported by the toil of others for high purposes of\naesthetic beauty.  Anyhow, why heat one's self wrestling with these\nproblems?\n\nWhen she was sure that Victor Dorn must have returned she called him on\nthe telephone.  \"Can't you come out to see me to-night?\" said she.\n\"I've something important--something YOU'LL think important--to consult\nyou about.\"  She felt a refusal forming at the other end of the wire\nand hastened to add:  \"You must know I'd not ask this if I weren't\ncertain you would be glad you came.\"\n\n\"Why not drop in here when you're down town?\" suggested Victor.\n\nShe wondered why she did not hang up the receiver and forget him.\n\nBut she did not.  She murmured, \"In due time I'll punish you for this,\nsir,\" and said to him:  \"There are reasons why it's impossible for me\nto go there just now.  And you know I can't meet you in a saloon or on\na street corner.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" laughed he.  \"Let me see.  I'm very busy.\nBut I could come for half an hour this afternoon.\"\n\nShe had planned an evening session, being well aware of the favorable\nqualities of air and light after the matter-of-fact sun has withdrawn\nhis last rays.  But she promptly decided to accept what offered.  \"At\nthree?\"\n\n\"At four,\" replied he.\n\n\"You haven't forgotten those books?\"\n\n\"Books?  Oh, yes--yes, I remember.  I'll bring them.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" said she sweetly.  \"Good-by.\"\n\nAnd at four she was waiting for him on the front veranda in a house\ndress that was--well, it was not quite the proper costume for such an\noccasion, but no one else was to see, and he didn't know about that\nsort of thing--and the gown gave her charms their best possible\nexposure except evening dress, which was out of the question.  She had\nnot long to wait.  One of the clocks within hearing had struck and\nanother was just beginning to strike when she saw him coming toward the\nhouse.  She furtively watched him, admiring his walk without quite\nknowing why.  You may perhaps know the walk that was Victor's--a steady\nforward advance of the whole body held firmly, almost rigidly--the walk\nof a man leading another to the scaffold, or of a man being led there\nin conscious innocence, or of a man ready to go wherever his purposes\nmay order--ready to go without any heroics or fuss of any kind, but\nsimply in the course of the day's business.  When a man walks like\nthat, he is worth observing--and it is well to think twice before\nobstructing his way.\n\nThat steady, inevitable advance gave Jane Hastings an absurd feeling of\nnervousness.  She had an impulse to fly, as from some oncoming danger.\nYet what was coming, in fact?  A clever young man of the working class,\ndressed in garments of the kind his class dressed in on Sunday, and\nplebeianly carrying a bundle under his arm.\n\n\"Our clock says you are three seconds late,\" cried she, laughing and\nextending her hand in a friendly, equal way that would have immensely\nflattered almost any man of her own class. \"But another protests that\nyou are one second early.\"\n\n\"I'm one of those fools who waste their time and their nerves by being\npunctual,\" said he.\n\nHe laid the books on the wicker sofa.  But instead of sitting Jane\nsaid:  \"We might be interrupted here.  Come to the west veranda.\"\n\nThere she had him in a leafy solitude--he facing her as she posed in\nfascinating grace in a big chair.  He looked at her--not the look of a\nman at a woman, but the look of a busy person at one who is about to\nshow cause for having asked for a portion of his valuable time.  She\nlaughed--and laughter was her best gesture. \"I can never talk to you if\nyou pose like that,\" said she. \"Honestly now, is your time so\npricelessly precious?\"\n\nHe echoed her laugh and settled himself more at his ease.  \"What did\nyou want of me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I intend to try to get better hours and better wages for the street\ncar men,\" said she.  \"To do it, I must know just what is right--what I\ncan hope to get.  General talk is foolish.  If I go at father I must\nhave definite proposals to make, with reasons for them.  I don't want\nhim to evade.  I would have gotten my information  elsewhere, but I\ncould think of no one but you who might not mislead me.\"\n\nShe had confidently expected that this carefully thought out scheme\nwould do the trick.  He would admire her, would be interested, would be\ndrawn into a position where she could enlist him as a constant adviser.\nHe moved toward the edge of his chair as if about to rise.  He said,\npleasantly enough but without a spark of enthusiasm:\n\n\"That's very nice of you, Miss Hastings.  But I can't advise\nyou--beyond saying that if I were you, I shouldn't meddle.\"\n\nShe--that is, her vanity--was cut to the quick.  \"Oh!\" said she with\nirony, \"I fancied you wished the laboring men to have a better sort of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he.  \"But I'm not in favor of running hysterically about\nwith a foolish little atomizer in the great stable.  You are talking\ncharity.  I am working for justice.  It will not really benefit the\nworking man for the company, at the urging of a sweet and lovely young\nLady Bountiful, to deign graciously to grant a little less slavery to\nthem.  In fact, a well fed, well cared for slave is worse off than one\nwho's badly treated--worse off because farther from his freedom.  The\nonly things that do our class any good, Miss Hastings, are the things\nthey COMPEL--compel by their increased intelligence and increased unity\nand power.  They get what they deserve.  They won't deserve more until\nthey compel more.  Gifts won't help--not even gifts from--\"  His\nintensely blue eyes danced--\"from such charming white hands so\nbeautifully manicured.\"\n\nShe rose with an angry toss of the head.  \"I didn't ask you here to\nannoy me with impertinences about my finger nails.\"\n\nHe rose, at his ease, good-humored, ready to go.  \"Then you should have\nworn gloves,\" said he carelessly, \"for I've been able to think only of\nyour finger nails--and to wonder WHAT can be done with hands like that.\nThank you for a pleasant talk.\" He bowed and smiled.  \"Good-by.\nOh--Miss Gordon sent you her love.\"\n\n\"What IS the matter, Mr. Dorn?\" cried the girl desperately. \"I want\nyour friendship--your respect.  CAN'T I get it?  Am I utterly hopeless\nin your eyes?\"\n\nA curious kind of color rose in his cheeks.  His eyes regarded her with\na mysterious steadiness.  \"You want neither my respect nor my\nfriendship,\" said he.  \"You want to amuse yourself.\" He pointed at her\nhands.  \"Those nails betray you.\"  He shrugged his shoulders, laughed,\nsaid as if to a child:  \"You are a nice girl, Jane Hastings.  It's a\npity you weren't brought up to be of some use.  But you weren't--and\nit's too late.\"\n\nHer eyes flashed, her bosom heaved.  \"WHY do I take these things from\nyou?  WHY do I invite them?\"\n\n\"Because you inherit your father's magnificent persistence--and you've\nset your heart on the whim of making a fool of me--and you hate to give\nup.\"\n\n\"You wrong me--indeed you do,\" cried she.  \"I want to learn--I want to\nbe of use in the world.  I want to have some kind of a real life.\"\n\n\"Really?\" mocked he good-humoredly.\n\n\"Really,\" said she with all her power of sweet earnestness.\n\n\"Then--cut your nails and go to work.  And when you have become a\ngenuine laborer, you'll begin to try to improve not the condition of\nothers, but your own.  The way to help workers is to abolish the idlers\nwho hang like a millstone about their necks. You can help only by\nabolishing the one idler under your control.\"\n\nShe stood nearer him, very near him.  She threw out her lovely arms in\na gesture of humility.  \"I will do whatever you say,\" she said.\n\nThey looked each into the other's eyes.  The color fled from her face,\nthe blood poured into his--wave upon wave, until he was like a man who\nhas been set on fire by the furious heat of long years of equatorial\nsun.  He muttered, wheeled about and strode away--in resolute and\nrelentless flight.  She dropped down where he had been sitting and hid\nher face in her perfumed hands.\n\n\"I care for him,\" she moaned, \"and he saw and he despises me! How COULD\nI--how COULD I!\"\n\nNevertheless, within a quarter of an hour she was in her dressing room,\nstanding at the table, eyes carefully avoiding her mirrored eyes--as\nshe cut her finger nails.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nJane was mistaken in her guess at the cause of Victor Dorn's agitation\nand abrupt flight.  If he had any sense whatever of the secret she had\nbetrayed to him and to herself at the same instant it was wholly\nunconscious.  He had become panic-stricken and had fled because he,\nfaced with her exuberance and tempting wealth of physical charm, had\nbecome suddenly conscious of her and of himself in a way as new to him\nas if he had been fresh from a monkery where no woman had ever been\nseen.  Thus far the world had been peopled for him with human beings\nwithout any reference to sex.  The phenomena of sex had not interested\nhim because his mind had been entirely taken up with the other aspects\nof life; and he had not yet reached the stage of development where a\nthinker grasps the truth that all questions are at bottom questions of\nthe sex relation, and that, therefore, no question can be settled right\nuntil the sex relations are settled right.\n\nJane Hastings was the first girl he had met in his whole life who was\nin a position to awaken that side of his nature.  And when his brain\nsuddenly filled with a torrent of mad longings and of sensuous\nappreciations of her laces and silk, of her perfume and smoothness and\nroundness, of the ecstasy that would come from contact with those warm,\nrosy lips--when Victor Dorn found himself all in a flash eager\nimpetuosity to seize this woman whom he did not approve of, whom he did\nnot even like, he felt bowed with shame.  He would not have believed\nhimself capable of such a thing.  He fled.\n\nHe fled, but she pursued.  And when he sat down in the garden behind\nhis mother's cottage, to work at a table where bees and butterflies had\nbeen his only disturbers, there was this SHE before him--her soft,\nshining gaze fascinating his gaze, her useless but lovely white hands\nextended tantalizingly toward him.\n\nAs he continued to look at her, his disapproval and dislike melted.  \"I\nwas brutally harsh to her,\" he thought repentantly.\n\n\"She was honestly trying to do the decent thing.  How was she to know?\nAnd wasn't I as much wrong as right in advising her not to help the\nmen?\"\n\nBeyond question, it was theoretically best for the two opposing forces,\ncapital and labor, to fight their battle to its inevitable end without\ninterference, without truce, with quarter neither given nor taken on\neither side.  But practically--wasn't there something to be said for\nsuch humane proposals of that of Jane Hastings?  They would put off the\nday of right conditions rightly and therefore permanently\nfounded--conditions in which master and slave or serf or wage-taker\nwould be no more; but, on the other hand, slaves with shorter hours of\ntoil and better surroundings could be enlightened  more easily.\nPerhaps.  He was by no means sure; he could not but fear that anything\nthat tended to make the slave comfortable in his degradation must of\nnecessity weaken his aversion to degradation.  Just as the worst kings\nwere the best kings because they hastened the fall of monarchy, so the\nworst capitalists, the most rapacious, the most rigid enforcers of the\neconomic laws of a capitalistic society were the best capitalists, were\nhelping to hasten the day when men would work for what they earned and\nwould earn what they worked for--when every man's pay envelope would\ncontain his wages, his full wages, and nothing but his wages.\n\nStill, where judgment was uncertain, he certainly had been unjust to\nthat well meaning girl.  And was she really so worthless as he had on\nfirst sight adjudged her?  There might be exceptions to the rule that a\nparasite born and bred can have no other instructor or idea but those\nof parasitism.  She was honest and earnest, was eager to learn the\ntruth.  She might be put to some use.  At any rate he had been unworthy\nof his own ideals when he, assuming without question that she was the\nusual capitalistic snob with the itch for gratifying vanity by\npatronizing the \"poor dear lower classes,\" had been almost insultingly\ncurt and mocking.\n\n\"What was the matter with me?\" he asked himself.  \"I never acted in\nthat way before.\"  And then he saw that his brusqueness had been the\ncover for fear of of her--fear of the allure of her luxury and her\nbeauty.  In love with her?  He knew that he was not.  No, his feeling\ntoward her was merely the crudest form of the tribute of man to\nwoman--though apparently woman as a rule preferred this form to any\nother.\n\n\"I owe her an apology,\" he said to himself.  And so it came to pass\nthat at three the following afternoon he was once more facing her in\nthat creeper-walled seclusion whose soft lights were almost equal to\nlight of gloaming or moon or stars in romantic charm.\n\nSaid he--always direct and simple, whether dealing with man or woman,\nwith devious person or straight:\n\n\"I've come to beg your pardon for what I said yesterday.\"\n\n\"You certainly were wild and strange,\" laughed she.\n\n\"I was supercilious,\" said he.  \"And worse than that there is not.\nHowever, as I have apologized, and you have accepted my apology, we\nneed waste no more time about that.  You wished to persuade your father\nto----\"\n\n\"Just a moment!\" interrupted she.  \"I've a question to ask. WHY did you\ntreat me--why have you been treating me so--so harshly?\"\n\n\"Because I was afraid of you,\" replied he.  \"I did not realize it, but\nthat was the reason.\"\n\n\"Afraid of ME,\" said she.  \"That's very flattering.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, coloring.  \"In some mysterious way I had been betrayed\ninto thinking of you as no man ought to think of a woman unless he is\nin love with her and she with him.  I am ashamed of myself.  But I\nshall conquer that feeling--or keep away from you.... Do you understand\nwhat the street car situation is?\"\n\nBut she was not to be deflected from the main question, now that it had\nbeen brought to the front so unexpectedly and in exactly the way most\nfavorable to her purposes.  \"You've made me uneasy,\" said she.  \"I\ndon't in the least understand what you mean.  I have wanted, and I\nstill want, to be friends with you--good friends--just as you and Selma\nGordon are--though of course I couldn't hope to be as close a friend as\nshe is.  I'm too ignorant--too useless.\"\n\nHe shook his head--with him, a gesture that conveyed the full strength\nof negation.  \"We are on opposite sides of a line across which\nfriendship is impossible.  I could not be your friend without being\nfalse to myself.  You couldn't be mine unless you were by some accident\nflung into the working class and forced to adopt it as your own.  Even\nthen you'd probably remain what you are.  Only a small part of the\nworking class as yet is at heart of the working class.  Most of us\nsecretly--almost openly--despise the life of work, and dream and hope a\ntime of fortune that will put us up among the masters and the idlers.\"\nHis expressive eyes became eloquent.  \"The false and shallow ideas that\nhave been educated into us for ages can't be uprooted in a few brief\nyears.\"\n\nShe felt the admiration she did not try to conceal.  She saw the proud\nand splendid conception of the dignity of labor--of labor as a\nblessing, not a curse, as a badge of aristocracy and not of slavery and\nshame.  \"You really believe that, don't you?\" she said.  \"I know it's\ntrue.  I say I believe it--who doesn't SAY so?  But I don't FEEL it.\"\n\n\"That's honest,\" said he heartily.  \"That's some thing to build on.\"\n\n\"And I'm going to build!\" cried she.  \"You'll help me--won't you?  I\nknow, it's a great deal to ask.  Why should you take the time and the\ntrouble to bother with one single unimportant person.\"\n\n\"That's the way I spend my life--in adding one man or one woman to our\nparty--one at a time.  It's slow building, but it's the only kind that\nendures.  There are twelve hundred of us now--twelve hundred voters, I\nmean.  Ten years ago there were only three hundred.  We'd expand much\nmore rapidly if it weren't for the constant shifts of population.  Our\nmen are forced to go elsewhere as the pressure of capitalism gets too\nstrong.  And in place of them come raw emigrants, ignorant, full of\ndreams of becoming capitalists and exploiters of their fellow men and\nidlers.  Ambition they call it.  Ambition!\"  He laughed.  \"What a\nvulgar, what a cruel notion of rising in the world!  To cease to be\nuseful, to become a burden to others!  ...  Did you ever think how many\npoor creatures have to toil longer hours, how many children have to go\nto the factory instead of to school, in order that there may be two\nhundred and seven automobiles privately kept in this town and\nseventy-four chauffeurs doing nothing but wait upon their masters?\nMoney doesn't grow on bushes, you know. Every cent of it has to be\nearned by somebody--and earned by MANUAL labor.\"\n\n\"I must think about that,\" she said--for the first time as much\ninterested in what he was saying as in the man himself.  No small\ntriumph for Victor over the mind of a woman dominated, as was Jane\nHastings, by the sex instinct that determines the thoughts and actions\nof practically the entire female sex.\n\n\"Yes--think about it,\" he urged.  \"You will never see it--or\nanything--until you see it for yourself.\"\n\n\"That's the way your party is built--isn't it?\" inquired she. \"Of those\nwho see it for themselves.\"\n\n\"Only those,\" replied he.  \"We want no others.\"\n\n\"Not even their votes?\" said she shrewdly.\n\n\"Not even their votes,\" he answered.  \"We've no desire to get the\noffices until we get them to keep.  And when we shall have conquered\nthe city, we'll move on to the conquest of the county--then of the\ndistrict--then of the state.  Our kind of movement is building in every\ncity now, and in most of the towns and many of the villages.  The old\nparties are falling to pieces because they stand for the old politics\nof the two factions of the upper class quarreling over which of them\nshould superintend the exploiting of the people.  Very few of us\nrealize what is going on before our very eyes--that we're seeing the\ndeath agonies of one form of civilization and the birth-throes of a\nnewer form.\"\n\n\"And what will it be?\" asked the girl.\n\nShe had been waiting for some sign of the \"crank,\" the impractical\ndreamer.  She was confident that this question would reveal the man she\nhad been warned against--that in answering it he would betray his true\nself.  But he disappointed and surprised her.\n\n\"How can I tell what it will be?\" said he.  \"I'm not a prophet.  All I\ncan say is I am sure it will be human, full of imperfections, full of\nopportunities for improvements--and that I hope it will be better than\nwhat we have now.  Probably not much better, but a little--and that\nlittle, however small it may be, will be a gain.  Doesn't history show\na slow but steady advance of the idea that the world is for the people\nwho live in it, a slow retreat of the idea that the world and the\npeople and all its and their resources are for a favored few of some\nkind of an upper class?  Yes--I think it is reasonable to hope that out\nof the throes will come a freer and a happier and a more intelligent\nrace.\"\n\nSuddenly she burst out, apparently irrelevantly:  \"But I can't--I\nreally can't agree with you that everyone ought to do physical labor.\nThat would drag the world down--yes, I'm sure it would.\"\n\n\"I guess you haven't thought about that,\" said he.  \"Painters do\nphysical labor--and sculptors--and writers--and all the scientific\nmen--and the inventors--and--\"  He laughed at her--\"Who doesn't do\nphysical labor that does anything really useful?  Why, you yourself--at\ntennis and riding and such things--do heavy physical labor.  I've only\nto look at your body to see that.  But it's of a foolish kind--foolish\nand narrowly selfish.\"\n\n\"I see I'd better not try to argue with you,\" said she.\n\n\"No--don't argue--with me or with anybody,\" rejoined he.  \"Sit down\nquietly and think about life--about your life.  Think how it is best to\nlive so that you may get the most out of life--the most substantial\nhappiness.  Don't go on doing the silly customary things simply because\na silly customary world says they are amusing and worth while.\nThink--and do--for yourself, Jane Hastings.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly and thoughtfully.  \"I'll try to,\" she said. She\nlooked at him with the expression of the mind aroused.  It was an\nexpression that often rewarded him after a long straight talk with a\nfellow being.  She went on:  \"I probably shan't do what you'd approve.\nYou see, I've got to be myself--got to live to a certain extent the\nkind of a life fate has made for me.\"\n\n\"You couldn't successfully live any other,\" said he.\n\n\"But, while it won't be at all what you'd regard as a model life--or\neven perhaps useful--it'll be very different--very much better--than it\nwould have been, if I hadn't met you--Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've done nothing,\" said he.  \"All I try to do is to encourage my\nfellow beings to be themselves.  So--live your own life--the life you\ncan live best--just as you wear the clothes that fit and become you....\nAnd now--about the street car question.  What do you want of me?\"\n\n\"Tell me what to say to father.\"\n\nHe shook his head.  \"Can't do it,\" said he.  \"There's a good place for\nyou to make a beginning.  Put on an old dress and go down town and get\nacquainted with the family life of the street-car men.  Talk to their\nwives and their children.  Look into the whole business yourself.\"\n\n\"But I'm not--not competent to judge,\" objected she.\n\n\"Well, make yourself competent,\" advised he.\n\n\"I might get Miss Gordon to go with me,\" suggested she.\n\n\"You'll learn more thoroughly if you go alone,\" declared he.\n\nShe hesitated--ventured with a winning smile:  \"You won't go with\nme--just to get me started right?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"You've got to learn for yourself--or not at all.  If I\ngo with you, you'll get my point of view, and it will take you so much\nthe longer to get your own.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd prefer I didn't go.\"\n\n\"It's not a matter of much importance, one way or the other--except\nperhaps to yourself,\" replied he.\n\n\"Any one individual can do the human race little good by learning the\ntruth about life.  The only benefit is to himself. Don't forget that in\nyour sweet enthusiasm for doing something noble and generous and\nhelpful.  Don't become a Davy Hull.  You know, Davy is on earth for the\nbenefit of the human race.  Ever since he was born he has been taken\ncare of--supplied with food, clothing, shelter, everything.  Yet he\nimagines that he is somehow a God-appointed guardian of the people who\nhave gathered and cooked his food, made his clothing, served him in\nevery way. It's very funny, that attitude of your class toward mine.\"\n\n\"They look up to us,\" said Jane.  \"You can't blame us for allowing\nit--for becoming pleased with ourselves.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of it--we do look up to you,\" admitted he.\n\"But--we're learning better.\"\n\n\"YOU'VE already learned better--you personally, I mean.  I think that\nwhen you compare me, for instance, with a girl like Selma Gordon, you\nlook down on me.\"\n\n\"Don't you, yourself, feel that any woman who is self-supporting and\nfree is your superior?\"\n\n\"In some moods, I do,\" replied Jane.  \"In other moods, I feel as I was\nbrought up to feel.\"\n\nThey talked on and on, she detaining him without seeming to do so.  She\nfelt proud of her adroitness.  But the truth was that his stopping on\nfor nearly two hours was almost altogether a tribute to her physical\ncharm--though Victor was unconscious of it.  When the afternoon was\ndrawing on toward the time for her father to come, she reluctantly let\nhim go.  She said:\n\n\"But you'll come again?\"\n\n\"I can't do that,\" replied he regretfully.  \"I could not come to your\nfather's house and continue free.  I must be able to say what I\nhonestly think, without any restraint.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said she.  \"And I want you to say and to write what you\nbelieve to be true and right.  But--we'll see each other again.  I'm\nsure we are going to be friends.\"\n\nHis expression as he bade her good-by told her that she had won his\nrespect and his liking.  She had a suspicion that she did not deserve\neither; but she was full of good resolutions, and assured herself she\nsoon would be what she had pretended--that her pretenses were not\nexactly false, only somewhat premature.\n\nAt dinner that evening she said to her father:\n\n\"I think I ought to do something beside enjoy myself.  I've decided to\ngo down among the poor people and see whether I can't help them in some\nway.\"\n\n\"You'd better keep away from that part of town,\" advised her father.\n\"They live awful dirty, and you might catch some disease.  If you want\nto do anything for the poor, send a check to our minister or to the\ncharity society.  There's two kinds of poor--those that are working\nhard and saving their money and getting up out of the dirt, and those\nthat haven't got no spunk or get-up.  The first kind don't need help,\nand the second don't deserve it.\"\n\n\"But there are the children, popsy,\" urged Jane.  \"The children of the\nno-account poor ought to have a chance.\"\n\n\"I don't reckon there ever was a more shiftless, do-easy pair than my\nfather and mother,\" rejoined Martin Hastings.  \"They were what set me\nto jumping.\"\n\nShe saw that his view was hopelessly narrow--that, while he regarded\nhimself justly as an extraordinary man, he also, for purposes of\nprejudice and selfishness, regarded his own achievements in overcoming\nwhat would have been hopeless handicaps to any but a giant in character\nand in physical endurance as an instance of what any one could do if he\nwould but work.  She never argued with him when she wished to carry her\npoint.  She now said:\n\n\"It seems to me that, in our own interest, we ought to do what we can\nto make the poor live better.  As you say, it's positively dangerous to\ngo about in the tenement part of town--and those people are always\ncoming among us.  For instance, our servants have relatives living in\nCooper Street, where there's a pest of consumption.\"\n\nOld Hastings nodded.  \"That's part of Davy Hull's reform programme,\"\nsaid he.  \"And I'm in favor of it.  The city government ought to make\nthem people clean up.\"\n\n\"Victor Dorn wants that done, too--doesn't he?\" said Jane.\n\n\"No,\" replied the old man sourly.  \"He says it's no use to clean up the\nslums unless you raise wages--and that then the slum people'd clean\nthemselves up.  The idea of giving those worthless trash more money to\nspend for beer and whisky and finery for their fool daughters.  Why,\nthey don't earn what we give 'em now.\"\n\nJane couldn't resist the temptation to say, \"I guess the laziest of\nthem earn more than Davy Hull or I.\"\n\n\"Because some gets more than they earn ain't a reason why others\nshould.\"  He grinned.  \"Maybe you and Davy ought to have less, but\nVictor Dorn and his riff-raff oughtn't to be pampered.... Do you want\nme to cut your allowance down?\"\n\nShe was ready for him.  \"If you can get as satisfactory a housekeeper\nfor less, you're a fool to overpay the one you have.\"\n\nThe old man was delighted.  \"I've been cheating you,\" said he. \"I'll\ndouble your pay.\"\n\n\"You're doing it just in time to stop a strike,\" laughed the girl.\n\nAfter a not unknown fashion she was most obedient to her father when\nhis commands happened to coincide with her own inclinations.\n\nHer ardor for an excursion into the slums and the tenements died almost\nwith Victor Dorn's departure.  Her father's reasons for forbidding her\nto go did not impress her as convincing, but she felt that she owed it\nto him to respect his wishes.  Anyhow, what could she find out that she\ndid not know already?  Yes, Dorn and her father were right in the\nconclusion each reached by a different road.  She would do well not to\nmeddle where she could not possibly accomplish any good.  She could\nquestion the servants and could get from them all the facts she needed\nfor urging her father at least to cut down the hours of labor.\n\nThe more she thought about Victor Dorn the more uneasy she became.  She\nhad made more progress with him than she had hoped to make in so short\na time.  But she had made it at an unexpected cost.  If she had\nsoftened him, he had established a disquieting influence over her.  She\nwas not sure, but she was afraid, that he was stronger than she--that,\nif she persisted in her whim, she would soon be liking him entirely too\nwell for her own comfort. Except as a pastime, Victor Dorn did not fit\ninto her scheme of life.  If she continued to see him, to yield to the\ndelight of his magnetic voice, of his fresh and original mind, of his\nenergetic and dominating personality, might he not become\naroused--begin to assert power over her, compel her to--to--she could\nnot imagine what; only, it was foolish to deny that he was a dangerous\nman.  \"If I've got good sense,\" decided she, \"I'll let him alone.  I've\nnothing to gain and everything to lose.\"\n\nHer motor--the one her father had ordered as a birthday present--came\nthe next day; and on the following  day two girl friends from\nCincinnati arrived for a long visit.  So, Jane Hastings had the help\nshe felt she perhaps needed in resisting the temptings of her whim.\n\nTo aid her in giving her friends a good time she impressed Davy Hull,\nin spite of his protests that his political work made social fooling\nabout impossible.  The truth was that the reform movement, of which he\nwas one of the figureheads, was being organized by far more skillful\nand expert hands than his--and for purposes of which he had no notion.\nSo, he really had all the time in the world to look after Ellen\nClearwater and Josie Arthur, and to pose as a serious man bent upon\ndoing his duty as an upper class person of leisure.  All that the\nreform machine wished of him was to talk and to pose--and to ride on\nthe show seat of the pretty, new political wagon.\n\nThe new movement had not yet been \"sprung\" upon the public.  It was\nstill an open secret among the young men of the \"better element\" in the\nLincoln, the Jefferson and the University clubs.\n\nMoney was being subscribed liberally by persons of good family who\nhoped for political preferment and could not get it from the old\nparties, and by corporations tired of being \"blackmailed\" by Kelly and\nHouse, and desirous of getting into office men who would give them what\nthey wanted because it was for the public good that they should not be\nhampered in any way.  With plenty of money an excellent machine could\nbe built and set to running. Also, there was talk of a fusion with the\nDemocratic machine, House to order the wholesale indorsement of the\nreform ticket in exchange for a few minor places.\n\nWhen the excitement among the young gentlemen over the approaching\nmoral regeneration of Remsen City politics was at the boiling point\nVictor Dorn sent for David Hull--asked him to come to the Baker Avenue\ncafe', which was the social headquarters of Dorn's Workingmen's League.\nAs Hull was rather counting on Dorn's support, or at least neutrality,\nin the approaching contest, he accepted promptly.  As he entered the\ncafe' he saw Dorn seated at a table in a far corner listening calmly to\na man who was obviously angrily in earnest.  At second glance he\nrecognized Tony Rivers, one of Dick Kelly's shrewdest lieutenants and a\nlabor leader of great influence in the unions of factory workers.\nAmong those in \"the know\" it was understood that Rivers could come\nnearer to delivering the labor vote than any man in Remsen City.  He\nknew whom to corrupt with bribes and whom to entrap by subtle appeals\nto ignorant prejudice.  As a large part of his herd was intensely\nCatholic, Rivers was a devout Catholic.  To quote his own phrase, used\nin a company on whose discretion he could count, \"Many's the pair of\npants I've worn out doing the stations of the Cross.\"  In fact, Rivers\nhad been brought up a Presbyterian, and under the name of Blake--his\ncorrect name--had \"done a stretch\" in Joliet for picking pockets.\n\nDorn caught sight of Davy Hull, hanging uncertainly  in the offing.  He\nrose at once, said a few words in a quiet, emphatic way to\nRivers--words of conclusion and dismissal--and advanced to meet Hull.\n\n\"I don't want to interrupt.  I can wait,\" said Hull, who saw Rivers'\nangry scowl at him.  He did not wish to offend the great labor leader.\n\n\"That fellow pushed himself on me,\" said Dorn.  \"I've nothing to say to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Tony Rivers--wasn't it?\" said Davy as they seated themselves at\nanother table.\n\n\"I'm going to expose him in next week's New Day,\" replied Victor.\n\"When I sent him a copy of the article for his corrections, if he could\nmake any, he came threatening.\"\n\n\"I've heard he's a dangerous man,\" said Davy.\n\n\"He'll not be so dangerous after Saturday,\" replied Victor. \"One by one\nI'm putting the labor agents of your friends out of business.  The best\nones--the chaps like Rivers--are hard to catch.  And if I should attack\none of them before I had him dead to rights, I'd only strengthen him.\"\n\n\"You think you can destroy Rivers' influence?\" said Davy incredulously.\n\n\"If I were not sure of it I'd not publish a line,\" said Victor.\n\n\"But to get to the subject I wish to talk to you about.  You are to be\nthe reform candidate for Mayor in the fall?\"\n\nDavy looked important and self-conscious.  \"There has been some talk\nof----\" he began.\n\n\"I've sent for you to ask you to withdraw from the movement, Hull,\"\ninterrupted Victor.\n\nHull smiled.  \"And I've come to ask you to support it,\" said Hull.\n\"We'll win, anyhow.  But I'd like to see all the forces against\ncorruption united in this campaign.  I am even urging my people to put\none or two of your men on the ticket.\"\n\n\"None of us would accept,\" said Victor.  \"That isn't our kind of\npolitics.  We'll take nothing until we get everything.... What do you\nknow about this movement you're lending your name to?\"\n\n\"I organized it,\" said Hull proudly.\n\n\"Pardon me--Dick Kelly organized it,\" replied Victor. \"They're simply\nusing you, Davy, to play their rotten game. Kelly knew he was certain\nto be beaten this fall.  He doesn't care especially for that, because\nHouse and his gang are just as much Kelly as Kelly himself.  But he's\nalarmed about the judgeship.\"\n\nDavy Hull reddened, though he tried hard to look indifferent.\n\n\"He's given up hope of pulling through the scoundrel who's on the bench\nnow.  He knows that our man would be elected, though his tool had the\nsupport of the Republicans, the Democrats and the new reform crowd.\"\n\nDorn had been watching Hull's embarrassed face keenly.  He now said:\n\"You understand, I see, why Judge Freilig changed his mind and decided\nthat he must stop devoting himself to the public and think of the\nwelfare of his family and resume the practice of the law?\"\n\n\"Judge Freilig is an honorable gentleman,\" said Davy with much dignity.\n\"I'm sorry, Dorn, that you listen to the lies of demagogues.\"\n\n\"If Freilig had persisted in running,\" said Victor, \"I should have\npublished the list of stocks and bonds of corporations benefiting by\nhis decisions that his brother and his father have come into possession\nof during his two terms on the bench.  Many of our judges are simply\nmentally crooked.  But Freilig is a bribe taker.  He probably believes\nhis decisions are just.  All you fellows believe that upper-class rule\nis really best for the people----\"\n\n\"And so it is,\" said Davy.  \"And you, an educated man, know it.\"\n\n\"I'll not argue that now,\" said Victor.  \"As I was saying, while\nFreilig decides for what he honestly thinks is right, he also feels he\nis entitled to a share of the substantial benefits. Most of the judges,\nafter serving the upper class faithfully for years, retire to an old\nage of comparative poverty.  Freilig thinks that is foolish.\"\n\n\"I suppose you agree with him,\" said Hull sarcastically.\n\n\"I sympathize with him,\" said Victor.  \"He retires with reputation\nunstained and with plenty of money.  If I should publish the truth\nabout him, would he lose a single one of his friends?  You know he\nwouldn't.  That isn't the way the world is run at present.\"\n\n\"No doubt it would be run much better if your crowd were in charge,\"\nsneered Hull.\n\n\"On the contrary, much worse,\" replied Victor unruffled.  \"But we're\neducating ourselves so that, when our time comes, we'll not do so\nbadly.\"\n\n\"You'll have plenty of time for education,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Victor.  \"But why are you angry?  Because you realize\nnow that your reform candidate for judge is of Dick Kelly's selecting?\"\n\n\"Kelly didn't propose Hugo Galland,\" cried Davy hotly.  \"I proposed him\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Was his the first name you proposed?\"\n\nSomething in Dorn's tone made Davy feel that it would be unwise to\nyield to the impulse to tell a lie--for the highly moral purpose of\nsilencing this agitator and demagogue.\n\n\"You will remember,\" pursued Victor, \"that Galland was the sixth or\nseventh name you proposed--and that Joe House rejected the others.  He\ndid it, after consulting with Kelly.  You recall--don't you?--that\nevery time you brought him a name he took time to consider?\"\n\n\"How do you know so much about all this?\" cried Davy, his tone\nsuggesting that Victor was wholly mistaken, but his manner betraying\nthat he knew Victor was right.\n\n\"Oh, politicians are human,\" replied Dorn.  \"And the human race is\nloose-mouthed.  I saw years ago that if I was to build my party I must\nhave full and accurate information as to all that was going on.  I made\nmy plans accordingly.\"\n\n\"Galland is an honest man--rich--above suspicion--above corruption--an\nideal candidate,\" said Davy.\n\n\"He is a corporation owner, a corporation lawyer--and a fool,\" said\nVictor.  \"As I've told you, all Dick Kelly's interest in this fall's\nlocal election is that judgeship.\"\n\n\"Galland is my man.  I want to see him elected.  If Kelly's for\nGalland, so much the better.  Then we're sure of electing him--of\ngetting the right sort of a man on the bench.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to argue with you about politics, Davy,\" said Victor.  \"I\nbrought you here because I like you--believe in your honesty--and don't\nwant to see you humiliated.  I'm giving you a chance to save yourself .\"\n\n\"From what?\" inquired Hull, not so valiant as he pretended to be.\n\n\"From the ridicule and disgrace that will cover this reform movement,\nif you persist in it.\"\n\nHull burst out laughing.  \"Of all the damned impudence!\" he exclaimed.\n\"Dorn, I think you've gone crazy .\"\n\n\"You can't irritate me, Hull.  I've been giving you the benefit of the\ndoubt.  I think you are falling into the commonest kind of error--doing\nevil and winking at evil in order that a good end may be gained.  Now,\nlisten.  What are the things you reformers are counting on to get you\nvotes this fall.\"\n\nDavy maintained a haughty silence.\n\n\"The traction scandals, the gas scandals and the paving scandals--isn't\nthat it?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Then--why have the gas crowd, the traction crowd and the paving crowd\neach contributed twenty-five thousand dollars to your campaign fund?\"\n\nHull stared at Victor Dorn in amazement.  \"Who told you that lie?\" he\nblustered.\n\nDorn looked at him sadly.  \"Then you knew?  I hoped you didn't, Hull.\nBut--now that you're facing the situation squarely, don't you see that\nyou're being made a fool of?  Would those people put up for your\nelection if they weren't SURE you and your crowd were THEIR crowd?\"\n\n\"They'll find out!\" cried Hull.\n\n\"You'll find out, you mean,\" replied Victor.  \"I see your whole\nprogramme, Davy.  They'll put you in, and they'll say, 'Let us alone\nand we'll make you governor of the State.  Annoy us, and you'll have no\npolitical future.'  And you'll say to yourself, 'The wise thing for me\nto do is to wait until I'm governor before I begin to serve the people.\nTHEN I can really do something.' And so, you'll be THEIR mayor--and\nafterward THEIR governor--because they'll hold out another inducement.\nAnyhow, by that time you'll be so completely theirs that you'll have no\nhope of a career except through them.\"\n\nAfter reading how some famous oration wrought upon its audience we turn\nto it and wonder that such tempests of emotion could have been produced\nby such simple, perhaps almost commonplace words. The key to the\nmystery is usually a magic quality in the tone of the orator, evoking\nbefore its hypnotized hearers a series of vivid pictures, just as the\nnotes of a violin, with no aid from words or even from musical form\nseem to materialize into visions.\n\nThis uncommon yet by no means rare power was in Victor Dorn's voice,\nand explained his extraordinary influence over people of all kinds and\nclasses; it wove a spell that enmeshed even those who disliked him for\nhis detestable views.  Davy Hull, listening to Victor's simple recital\nof his prospective career, was so wrought upon that he sat staring\nbefore him in a kind of terror.\n\n\"Davy,\" said Victor gently, \"you're at the parting of the ways.  The\ntime for honest halfway reformers--for political amateurs has passed.\n'Under which king, Bezonian?  Speak or die!'--that's the situation\ntoday.\"\n\nAnd Hull knew that it was so.  \"What do you propose, Dorn?\" he said.\n\"I want to do what's right--what's best for the people.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the people, Hull,\" said Victor.\n\n\"Upper classes come and pass, but the people remain--bigger and\nstronger and more aggressive with every century.  And they dictate\nlanguage and art, and politics and religion--what we shall all eat and\nwear and think and do.  Only what they approve, only that yoke even\nwhich they themselves accept, has any chance of enduring.  Don't worry\nabout the people, Davy.  Worry about yourself.\"\n\n\"I admit,\" said Hull, \"that I don't like a lot of things about the--the\nforces I find I've got to use in order to carry through my plans.  I\nadmit that even the sincere young fellows I've grouped together to head\nthis movement are narrow--supercilious--self-satisfied--that they\nirritate me and are not trustworthy.  But I feel that, if I once get\nthe office, I'll be strong enough to put my plans through.\"  Nervously,\n\"I'm giving you my full confidence--as I've given it to no one else.\"\n\n\"You've told me nothing I didn't know already,\" said Victor.\n\n\"I've got to choose between this reform party and your party,\"\ncontinued Hull.  \"That is, I've got no choice.  For, candidly, I've no\nconfidence in the working class.  It's too ignorant to do the ruling.\nIt's too credulous to build on--for its credulity makes it fickle.  And\nI believe in the better class, too.  It may be sordid and greedy and\ntyrannical, but by appealing to its good instincts--and to its fear of\nthe money kings and the monopolists, something good can be got through\nit.\"\n\n\"If you want to get office,\" said Dorn, \"you're right.  But if you want\nto BE somebody, if you want to develop yourself, to have the joy of\nbeing utterly unafraid in speech and in action--why, come with us.\"\n\nAfter a pause Hull said, \"I'd like to do it.  I'd like to help you.\"\n\nVictor laid his hand on Davy's arm.  \"Get it straight, Davy,\" he said.\n\"You can't help us.  We don't need you.  It's you that needs us.  We'll\nmake an honest man of you--instead of a trimming politician, trying to\nsay or to do something more or less honest once in a while and winking\nat or abetting crookedness most of the time.\"\n\n\"I've done nothing, and I'll do nothing, to be ashamed of,\" protested\nHull.\n\n\"You are not ashamed of the way your movement is financed?\"\n\nDavy moved uncomfortably.  \"The money's ours now,\" said he. \"They gave\nit unconditionally.\"\n\nBut he could not meet Victor's eyes.  Victor said:  \"They paid a\nhundred thousand dollars for a judgeship and for a blanket mortgage on\nyour party.  And if you should win, you'd find you could do little\nshowy things that were of no value, but nothing that would seriously\ndisturb a single leech sucking the blood of this community.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said Davy.  He roused himself into anger--his\nonly remaining refuge.  \"Your prejudices blind you to all the\nmeans--the PRACTICAL means--of doing good, Dorn.  I've listened\npatiently to you because I respect your sincerity.  But I'm not going\nto waste my life in mere criticism.  I'm going to DO something.\"\n\nAn expression of profound sadness came into Victor's face. \"Don't\ndecide now,\" he said.  \"Think it over.  Remember what I've told you\nabout what we'll be compelled to do if you launch this party.\"\n\nHull was tempted to burst out violently.  Was not this swollen-headed\nupstart trying to intimidate him by threats?  But his strong instinct\nfor prudence persuaded him to conceal his resentment.  \"Why the devil\nshould you attack US?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Surely we're nearer your kind of thing than the old parties--and we,\ntoo, are against them--their rotten machines.\"\n\n\"We purpose to keep the issue clear in this town,\" replied Victor.\n\"So, we can't allow a party to grow up that PRETENDS to be just as good\nas ours but is really a cover behind which the old parties we've been\nbattering to pieces can reorganize.\"\n\n\"That is, you'll tolerate in this market no brand of honest politics\nbut your own?\"\n\n\"If you wish to put it that way,\" replied Victor coolly.\n\n\"I suppose you'd rather see Kelly or House win?\"\n\n\"We'll see that House does win,\" replied Victor.  \"When we have shot\nyour movement full of holes and sunk it, House will put up a straight\nDemocratic ticket, and it will win.\"\n\n\"And House means Kelly--and Kelly means corruption rampant.\"\n\n\"And corruption rampant means further and much needed education in the\nschool of hard experience for the voters,\" said Dorn. \"And the more\neducation, the larger our party and the quicker its triumph.\"\n\nHull laughed angrily.  \"Talk about low self-seeking!  Talk about rotten\npractical politics!\"\n\nBut Dorn held his good humor of the man who has the power and knows it.\n\"Think it over, Davy,\" counseled he.  \"You'll see you've got to come\nwith us or join Kelly.  For your own sake I'd like to see you with us.\nFor the party's sake you'd better be with Kelly, for you're not really\na workingman, and our fellows would be uneasy about you for a long\ntime.  You see, we've had experience of rich young men whose hearts\nbeat for the wrongs of the working class--and that experience has not\nbeen fortunate.\"\n\n\"Before you definitely decide to break with the decent element of the\nbetter class, Victor, I want YOU to think it over,\" said Davy.  \"We--I,\nmyself--have befriended you more than once.  But for a few of us who\nstill have hope that demagoguery will die of itself, your paper would\nhave been suppressed long ago.\"\n\nVictor laughed.  \"I wish they would suppress it,\" said he. \"The result\nwould give the 'better element' in this town a very bad quarter of an\nhour, at least.\"  He rose.  \"We've both said all we've got to say to\neach other.  I see I've done no good.  I feared it would be so.\"  He\nwas looking into Hull's eyes--into his very soul.  \"When we meet again,\nyou will probably be my open and bitter enemy.  It's a pity.  It makes\nme sad.  Good-by, and--do think it over, Davy.\"\n\nDorn moved rapidly away.  Hull looked after him in surprise.  At first\nblush he was astonished that Dorn should care so much about him as this\ncurious interview and his emotion at its end indicated.  But on\nreflecting his astonishment disappeared, and he took the view that Dorn\nwas simply impressed by his personality and by his ability--was perhaps\ncraftily trying to disarm him and to destroy his political movement\nwhich was threatening to destroy the Workingmen's League.  \"A very\nshrewd chap is Dorn,\" thought Davy--why do we always generously concede\nat least acumen to those we suspect of having a good opinion of us?--\"A\nVERY shrewd chap.  It's unfortunate he's cursed with that miserable\nenvy of those better born and better off than he is.\"\n\nDavy spent the early evening at the University Club, where he was an\nimportant figure.  Later on he went to a dance at Mrs. Venable's--and\nthere he was indeed a lion, as an unmarried man with money cannot but\nbe in a company of ladies--for money to a lady is what soil and sun and\nrain are to a flower--is that without which she must cease to exist.\nBut still later, when he was alone in bed--perhaps with the supper he\nate at Mrs. Venable's not sitting as lightly as comfort required--the\nthings Victor Dorn had said came trailing drearily through his mind.\nWhat kind of an article would Dorn print?  Those facts about the\ncampaign fund certainly would look badly in cold type--especially if\nDorn had the proofs.  And Hugo Galland--  Beyond question the mere list\nof the corporations in which Hugo was director or large stockholder\nwould make him absurd as a judge, sitting in that district.  And Hugo\nthe son-in-law of the most offensive capitalist in that section of the\nState!  And the deal with House, endorsed by Kelly--how nasty that\nwould look, IF Victor had the proofs.  IF Victor had the proofs.  But\nhad he?\n\n\"I MUST have a talk with Kelly,\" said Davy, aloud.\n\nThe words startled him--not his voice suddenly sounding in the profound\nstillness of his bedroom, but the words themselves.  It was his first\nadmission to himself of the vicious truth he had known from the outset\nand had been pretending to himself that he did not know--the truth that\nhis reform movement was a fraud contrived by Dick Kelly to further the\ninterests of the company of financiers and the gang of\npolitico-criminal thugs who owned the party machinery.  It is a nice\nquestion whether a man is ever allowed to go in HONEST self-deception\ndecisively far along a wrong road.  However this may be, certain it is\nthat David Hull, reformer, was not so allowed.  And he was glad of the\ndarkness that hid him at least physically from himself as he strove to\nconvince himself that, if he was doing wrong, it was from the highest\nmotives and for the noblest purposes and would result in the public\ngood--and not merely in fame and office for David Hull.\n\nThe struggle ended as struggles usually end in the famous arena of\nmoral sham battles called conscience; and toward the middle of the\nfollowing morning Davy, at peace with himself and prepared to make any\nsacrifice of personal squeamishness or moral idealism for the sake of\nthe public good, sought out Dick Kelly.\n\nKelly's original headquarters had, of course, been the doggery in and\nthrough which he had established himself as a political power.  As his\npower grew and his relations with more respectable elements of society\nextended he shifted to a saloon and beer garden kept by a reputable\nGerman and frequented by all kinds of people--a place where his friends\nof the avowedly criminal class and his newer friends of the class that\ndoes nothing legally criminal, except in emergencies, would feel\nequally at ease.  He retained ownership of the doggery, but took his\nname down and put up that of his barkeeper.  When he won his first big\npolitical fight and took charge of the public affairs of Remsen City\nand made an arrangement with Joe House where--under Remsen City,\nwhenever it wearied or sickened of Kelly, could take instead Kelly\ndisguised as Joe House--when he thus became a full blown boss he\nestablished a secondary headquarters in addition to that at Herrmann's\nGarden.  Every morning at ten o'clock he took his stand in the main\ncorridor of the City Hall, really a thoroughfare and short cut for the\nbusiest part of town.  With a cigar in his mouth he stood there for an\nhour or so, holding court, making appointments, attending to all sorts\nof political business.\n\nPresently his importance and his ideas of etiquette expanded to such an\nextent that he had to establish the Blaine Club.  Joe House's Tilden\nClub was established two years later, in imitation of Kelly.  If you\nhad very private and important business with Kelly--business of the\nkind of which the public must get no inkling, you made--preferably by\ntelephone--an appointment to meet him in his real estate offices in the\nHastings Building--a suite with entrances and exits into three\nseparated corridors. If you wished to see him about ordinary matters\nand were a person who could \"confer\" with Kelly without its causing\ntalk you met him at the Blaine Club.  If you wished to cultivate him,\nto pay court to him, you saw him at Herrmann's--or in the general rooms\nof the club.  If you were a busy man and had time only to exchange\ngreetings with him--to \"keep in touch\"--you passed through the City\nHall now and then at his hour.  Some bosses soon grow too proud for the\nvulgar democracy of such a public stand; but Kelly, partly through\nshrewdness, partly through inclination, clung to the City Hall stand\nand encouraged the humblest citizens to seek him there and tell him the\nnews or ask his aid or his advice.\n\nIt was at the City Hall that Davy Hull sought him, and found him.\n\nTwice he walked briskly to the boss; the third time he went by slowly.\nKelly, who saw everything, had known from the first glance at Hull's\ngrave, anxious face, that the young leader of the \"holy boys\" was there\nto see him.  But he ignored Davy until Davy addressed him directly.\n\n\"Howdy, Mr. Hull!\" said he, observing the young man with eyes that\ntwinkled cynically.  \"What's the good word?\"\n\n\"I want to have a little talk with you,\" Davy blurted out. \"Where could\nI see you?\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Kelly.  \"Talk away.\"\n\n\"Couldn't I see you at some--some place where we'd not be interrupted?\nI saw Victor Dorn yesterday, and he said some things that I think you\nought to know about.\"\n\n\"I do know about 'em,\" replied Kelly.\n\n\"Are you sure?  I mean his threats to--to----\"\n\nAs Davy paused in an embarrassed search for a word that would not hurt\nhis own but recently soothed conscience, Kelly laughed. \"To expose you\nholy boys?\" inquired he.  \"To upset the nice moral campaign you and Joe\nHouse have laid out?  Yes, I know all about Mr. Victor Dorn.  But--Joe\nHouse is the man you want to see.  You boys are trying to do me\nup--trying to break up the party.  You can't expect ME to help you.\nI've got great respect for you personally, Mr. Hull.  Your father--he\nwas a fine old Republican wheel-horse.  He stood by the party through\nthick and thin--and the party stood by him.  So, I respect his\nson--personally.  But politically--that's another matter. Politically I\nrespect straight organization men of either party, but I've got no use\nfor amateurs and reformers.  So--go to Joe House.\"  All this in perfect\ngood humor, and in a tone of banter that might have ruffled a man with\na keener sense of humor than Davy's.\n\nDavy was red to his eyes, not because Kelly was laughing at him, but\nbecause he stood convicted of such a stupid political blunder as coming\ndirect to Kelly when obviously he should have gone to Kelly's secret\npartner.  \"Dorn means to attack us all--Republicans, Democrats and\nCitizens' Alliance,\" stammered Davy, trying to justify himself.\n\nKelly shifted his cigar and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Don't worry about his attacks on me--on US,\" said he.  \"We're used to\nbeing attacked.  We haven't got no reputation for superior virtue to\nlose.\"\n\n\"But he says he can prove that our whole campaign is simply a deal\nbetween you and House and me to fool the people and elect a bad judge.\"\n\n\"So I've heard,\" said Kelly.  \"But what of it?  You know it ain't so.\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Mr. Kelly,\" replied Hull, desperately.  \"On the contrary,\nI think it is so.  And I may add I think we are justified in making\nsuch a deal, when that's the only way to save the community from Victor\nDorn and his crowd of--of anarchists.\"\n\nKelly looked at him silently with amused eyes.\n\n\"House can't do anything,\" pursued Davy.  \"Maybe YOU can.  So I came\nstraight to you.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're getting a little political sense, my boy,\" said Kelly.\n\"Perhaps you're beginning to see that a politician has got to be\npractical--that it's the organizations that keeps this city from being\nthe prey to Victor Dorns.\"\n\n\"I see that,\" said Davy.  \"I'm willing to admit that I've misjudged\nyou, Mr. Kelly--that the better classes owe you a heavy debt--and that\nyou are one of the men we've got to rely on chiefly to stem the tide of\nanarchy that's rising--the attack on the propertied classes--the\nintelligent classes.\"\n\n\"I see your eyes are being opened, my boy,\" said Kelly in a kindly tone\nthat showed how deeply he appreciated this unexpected recognition of\nhis own notion of his mission.  \"You young silk stocking fellows up at\nthe University Club, and the Lincoln and the Jefferson, have been\nindulging in a lot of loose talk against the fellows that do the hard\nwork in politics--the fellows that helped your fathers to make fortunes\nand that are helping you boys to keep 'em.  If I didn't have a pretty\nlevel head on me, I'd take my hands off and give Dorn and his gang a\nchance at you. I tell you, when you fool with that reform nonsense, you\nplay with fire in a powder mill.\"\n\n\"But I--I had an idea that you wanted me to go ahead,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Not the way you started last spring,\" replied Kelly. \"Not the way\nyou'd 'a gone if I hadn't taken hold.  I've been saving you in spite of\nyourselves.  Thanks to me, your party's on a sound, conservative basis\nand won't do any harm and may do some good in teaching a lesson to\nthose of our boys that've been going a little too far.  It ain't good\nfor an organization to win always.\"\n\n\"Victor Dorn seemed to be sure--absolutely sure,\" said Hull. \"And he's\npretty shrewd at politics--isn't he?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about him, I tell you,\" replied Kelly.\n\nThe sudden hardening of his voice and of his never notably soft face\nwas tribute stronger than any words to Dorn's ability as a politician,\nto his power as an antagonist.  Davy felt a sinister intent--and he\nknew that Dick Kelly had risen because he would stop at nothing.  He\nwas as eager to get away from the boss as the boss was to be rid of\nhim.  The intrusion of a henchman, to whom Kelly had no doubt signaled,\ngave him the excuse.  As soon as he had turned from the City Hall into\nMorton Street he slackened to as slow a walk as his length of leg would\npermit. Moving along, absorbed in uncomfortable thoughts, he startled\nviolently when he heard Selma Gordon's voice:\n\n\"How d'you do, Mr. Hull?  I was hoping I'd see you to-day.\"\n\nShe was standing before him--the same fascinating embodiment of life\nand health and untamed energy; the direct, honest glance.\n\n\"I want to talk to you,\" she went on, \"and I can't, walking beside you.\nYou're far too tall.  Come into the park and we'll sit on that bench\nunder the big maple.\"\n\nHe had mechanically lifted his hat, but he had not spoken.  He did not\nfind words until they were seated side by side, and then all he could\nsay was:\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you again--very glad, indeed.\"\n\nIn fact, he was the reverse of glad, for he was afraid of her, afraid\nof himself when under the spell of her presence.  He who prided himself\non his self-control, he could not account for the effect this girl had\nupon him.  As he sat there beside her the impulse Jane Hastings had so\nadroitly checked came surging back. He had believed, had hoped it was\ngone for good and all.  He found that in its mysterious hiding place it\nhad been gaining strength.  Quite clearly he saw how absurd was the\nidea of making this girl his wife--he tall and she not much above the\nbend of his elbow; he conventional, and she the incarnation of\npassionate revolt against the restraints of class and form and custom\nwhich he not only conformed to but religiously believed in.  And she\nset stirring in him all kinds of vague, wild longings to run amuck\nsocially and politically--longings that, if indulged, would ruin him\nfor any career worthy of the name.\n\nHe stood up.  \"I must go--I really must,\" he said, confusedly.\n\nShe laid her small, strong hand on his arm--a natural, friendly gesture\nwith her, and giving no suggestion of familiarity.  Even as she was\nsaying, \"Please--only a moment,\" he dropped back to the seat.\n\n\"Well--what is it?\" he said abruptly, his gaze resolutely away from her\nface.\n\n\"Victor was telling me this morning about his talk with you,\" she said\nin her rapid, energetic way.  \"He was depressed because he had failed.\nBut I felt sure--I feel sure--that he hasn't. In our talk the other\nday, Mr. Hull, I got a clear idea of your character.  A woman\nunderstands better.  And I know that, after Victor told you the plain\ntruth about the situation, you couldn't go on.\"\n\nDavid looked round rather wildly, swallowed hard several times, said\nhoarsely:  \"I won't, if you'll marry me.\"\n\nBut for a slight change of expression or of color Davy would have\nthought she had not heard--or perhaps that he had imagined he was\nuttering the words that forced themselves to his lips in spite of his\nefforts to suppress them.  For she went on in the same impetuous,\nfriendly way:\n\n\"It seemed to me that you have an instinct for the right that's unusual\nin men of your class.  At least, I think it's unusual.  I confess I've\nnot known any man of your class except you--and I know you very\nslightly.  It was I that persuaded Victor to go to you.  He believes\nthat a man's class feeling controls him--makes his moral sense--compels\nhis actions.  But I thought you were an exception--and he yielded after\nI urged him a while.\"\n\n\"I don't know WHAT I am,\" said Hull gloomily.  \"I think I want to do\nright.  But--what is right?  Not theoretical right, but the practical,\nworkable thing?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" conceded Selma.  \"We can't always be certain what's\nright.  But can't we always know what's wrong?  And, Mr. Hull, it is\nwrong--altogether wrong--and YOU know it's wrong--to lend your name and\nyour influence and your reputation to that crowd.  They'd let you do a\nlittle good--why?  To make their professions of reform seem plausible.\nTo fool the people into trusting them again.  And under cover of the\nlittle good you were showily doing, how much mischief they'd do!  If\nyou'll go back over the history of this town--of any town--of any\ncountry--you'll find that most of the wicked things--the things that\npile the burdens on the shoulders of the poor--the masses--most of the\nwicked things have been done under cover of just such men as you, used\nas figureheads.\"\n\n\"But I want to build up a new party--a party of honest men, honestly\nled,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Led by your sort of young men?  I mean young men of your class. Led by\nyoung lawyers and merchants and young fellows living on inherited\nincomes?  Don't you see that's impossible,\" cried Selma.  \"They are all\nliving off the labor of others.  Their whole idea of life is exploiting\nthe masses--is reaping where they have not sown or reaping not only\nwhat they've sown but also what others have sown--for they couldn't buy\nluxury and all the so-called refinements of life for themselves and\ntheir idle families merely with what they themselves could earn.  How\ncan you build up a really HONEST party with such men?  They may mean\nwell.  They no doubt are honest, up to a certain point.  But they will\nside with their class, in every crisis.  And their class is the\nexploiting class.\"\n\n\"I don't agree with you,\" said Davy.  \"You are not fair to us.\"\n\n\"How!\" demanded Selma.\n\n\"I couldn't argue with you,\" replied Hull.  \"All I'll say is that\nyou've seen only the one side--only the side of the working class.\"\n\n\"That toils without ceasing--its men, its women, its children--\" said\nthe girl with heaving bosom and flashing eyes--\"only to have most of\nwhat it earns filched away from it by your class to waste in foolish\nluxury!\"\n\n\"And whose fault is that?\" pleaded Hull.\n\n\"The fault of my class,\" replied she.  \"Their ignorance, their\nstupidity--yes, and their foolish cunning that overreaches itself.  For\nthey tolerate the abuses of the present system because each man--at\nleast, each man of the ones who think themselves 'smart'--imagines that\nthe day is coming when he can escape from the working class and gain\nthe ranks of the despoilers.\"\n\n\"And you ask ME to come into the party of those people!\" scoffed Davy.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Hull,\" said she--and until then he had not appreciated how\nlovely her voice was.  \"Yes--that is the party for you--for all honest,\nsincere men who want to have their own respect through and through.  To\nteach those people--to lead them right--to be truthful and just with\nthem--that is the life worth while.\"\n\n\"But they won't learn.  They won't be led right.  They are as\nungrateful as they are foolish.  If they weren't, men like me trying to\nmake a decent career wouldn't have to compromise with the Kellys and\nthe Houses and their masters.  What are Kelly and House but leaders of\nyour class?  And they lead ten to Victor Dorn's one.  Why, any day\nDorn's followers may turn on him--and you know it.\"\n\n\"And what of that?\" cried Selma.  \"He's not working to be their leader,\nbut to do what he thinks is right, regardless of consequences.  Why is\nhe a happy man, as happiness goes?  Why has he gone on his way steadily\nall these years, never minding setbacks and failures and defeats and\ndangers?  I needn't tell you why.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Hull, powerfully moved by her earnestness.  \"I understand.\"\n\n\"The finest sentence that ever fell from human lips,\" Selma went on,\n\"was 'Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.'  Forgive\nthem--forgive us all--for when we go astray it is because we are in the\ndark.  And I want you to come with us, Mr. Hull, and help to make it a\nlittle less dark.  At least, you will then be looking toward the\nlight--and every one turned in that direction counts.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, Hull said:\n\n\"Miss Gordon, may I ask you a very personal question?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.\n\n\"Are you in love with Victor Dorn?\"\n\nSelma laughed merrily.  \"Jane Hastings had that same curiosity,\" said\nshe.  \"I'll answer you as I answered her--though she didn't ask me\nquite so directly.  No, I am not in love with him.  We are too busy to\nbother about those things.  We have too much to do to think about\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Then--there is no reason why I should not ask you to be my wife--why I\nshould not hope--and try?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a peculiar smile.  \"Yes, there is a very good\nreason.  I do not love you, and I shall not love you.  I shall not have\ntime for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe in love?\"\n\n\"I don't believe in much else,\" said she.  \"But--not the kind of love\nyou offer me.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" cried he.  \"I have not told you yet how I feel\ntoward you.  I have not----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you have,\" interrupted she.  \"This is the second--no, the\nthird time you have seen me.  So, the love you offer me can only be of\na kind it is not in the least flattering to a woman to inspire.  You\nneedn't apologize,\" she went on, laughingly.  \"I've no doubt you mean\nwell.  You simply don't understand me--my sort of woman.\"\n\n\"It's you that don't understand, Selma,\" cried he.  \"You don't realize\nhow wonderful you are--how much you reveal of yourself at once.  I was\nall but engaged to another woman when I saw you. I've been fighting\nagainst my love for you--fighting against the truth that suddenly came\nto me that you were the only woman I had ever seen who appealed to and\naroused and made strong all that is brave and honest in me.  Selma, I\nneed you.  I am not infatuated. I am clearer-headed than I ever was in\nmy life.  I need you. You can make a man of me.\"\n\nShe was regarding him with a friendly and even tender sympathy. \"I\nunderstand now,\" she said.  \"I thought it was simply the ordinary\noutburst of passion.  But I see that it was the result of your struggle\nwith yourself about which road to take in making a career.\"\n\nIf she had not been absorbed in developing her theory she might have\nseen that Davy was not altogether satisfied with this analysis of his\nfeelings.  But he deemed it wise to hold his peace.\n\n\"You do need some one--some woman,\" she went on.  \"And I am anxious to\nhelp you all I can.  I couldn't help you by marrying you.  To me\nmarriage means----\"  She checked herself abruptly. \"No matter.  I can\nhelp you, I think, as a friend.  But if you wish to marry, you should\ntake some one in your own class--some one who's in sympathy with you.\nThen you and she could work it out together--could help each other.\nYou see, I don't need you--and there's nothing in one-sided\nmarriages....  No, you couldn't give me anything I need, so far as I\ncan see.\"\n\n\"I believe that's true,\" said Davy miserably.\n\nShe reflected, then continued:  \"But there's Jane Hastings.  Why not\nmarry her?  She is having the same sort of struggle with herself.  You\nand she could help each other.  And you're, both of you, fine\ncharacters.  I like each of you for exactly the same reasons....\nYes--Jane needs you, and you need her.\"  She looked at him with her\nsweet, frank smile like a breeze straight from the sweep of a vast\nplateau.  \"Why, it's so obvious that I wonder you and she haven't\nbecome engaged long ago.  You ARE fond of her, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Selma,\" cried Davy, \"I LOVE you.  I want YOU.\"\n\nShe shook her head with a quaint, fascinating expression of\npositiveness.  \"Now, my friend,\" said she, \"drop that fancy. It isn't\nsensible.  And it threatens to become silly.\"  Her smile suddenly\nexpanded into a laugh.  \"The idea of you and me married--of ME married\nto YOU!  I'd drive you crazy.  No, I shouldn't stay long enough for\nthat.  I'd be of on the wings of the wind to the other end of the earth\nas soon as you tried to put a halter on me.\"\n\nHe did not join in her laugh.  She rose.  \"You will think again before\nyou go in with those people--won't you, David?\" she said, sober and\nearnest.\n\n\"I don't care what becomes of me,\" he said boyishly.\n\n\"But _I_ do,\" she said.  \"I want to see you the man you can be.\"\n\n\"Then--marry me,\" he cried.\n\nHer eyes looked gentle friendship; her passionate lips curled in scorn.\n\"I might marry the sort of man you could be,\" she said, \"but I never\ncould marry a man so weak that, without me to bolster him up, he'd\nbecome a stool-pigeon.\"\n\nAnd she turned and walked away.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nA few days later, after she had taken her daily two hours' walk, Selma\nwent into the secluded part of Washington Park and spent the rest of\nthe morning writing.  Her walk was her habitual time for thinking out\nher plans for the day.  And when it was writing that she had to do, and\nthe weather was fine, that particular hillside with its splendid shade\nso restful for the eyes and so stimulating to the mind became her\nwork-shop.  She thought that she was helped as much by the colors of\ngrass and foliage as by the softened light and the tranquil view out\nover hills and valleys.\n\nWhen she had finished her article she consulted the little nickel watch\nshe carried in her bag and discovered that it was only one o'clock.\nShe had counted on getting through at three or half past.  Two hours\ngained.  How could she best use them.  The part of the Park where she\nwas sitting was separated from the Hastings grounds only by the winding\nhighroad making its last reach for the top of the hill.  She decided\nthat she would go to see Jane Hastings--would try to make tactful\nprogress in her project of helping Jane and David Hull by marrying them\nto each other.  Once she had hit upon this project her interest in both\nof them had equally increased.  Yes, these gained two hours was an\nopportunity not to be neglected.\n\nShe put her papers into her shopping bag and went straight up the steep\nhill.  She arrived at the top, at the edge of the lawn before Jane's\nhouse, with somewhat heightened color and brightened eyes, but with no\nquickening of the breath.  Her slim, solid little body had all the\nqualities of endurance of those wiry ponies that come from the regions\nher face and walk and the careless grace of her hair so delightfully\nsuggested.  As she advanced toward the house she saw a gay company\nassembled on the wide veranda.  Jane was giving a farewell luncheon for\nher visitors, had asked almost a dozen of the most presentable girls in\nthe town.  It was a very fashionable affair, and everyone had dressed\nfor it in the best she had to wear at that time of day.\n\nSelma saw the company while there was still time for her to draw back\nand descend into the woods.  But she knew little about\nconventionalities, and she cared not at all about them.  She had come\nto see Jane; she conducted herself precisely as she would have expected\nany one to act who came to see her at any time. She marched straight\nacross the lawn.  The hostess, the fashionable visitors, the\nfashionable guests soon centered upon the extraordinary figure moving\ntoward them under that blazing sun.  The figure was extraordinary not\nfor dress--the dress was plain and unconspicuous--but for that\nexpression of the free and the untamed, the lack of self-consciousness\nso rarely seen except in children and animals.  Jane rushed to the\nsteps to welcome her, seized her extended hands and kissed her with as\nmuch enthusiasm as she kissed Jane.  There was sincerity in this\ngreeting of Jane's; but there was pose, also.  Here was one of those\nchances to do the unconventional, the democratic thing.\n\n\"What a glorious surprise!\" cried Jane.  \"You'll stop for lunch, of\ncourse?\"  Then to the girls nearest them:  \"This is Selma Gordon, who\nwrites for the New Day.\"\n\nPronouncing of names--smiles--bows--veiled glances of\ncuriosity--several young women exchanging whispered comments of\namusement.  And to be sure, Selma, in that simple costume, gloveless,\nwith dusty shoes and blown hair, did look very much out of place.  But\nthen Selma would have looked, in a sense, out of place anywhere but in\na wilderness with perhaps a few tents and a half-tamed herd as\nbackground.  In another sense, she seemed in place anywhere as any\nnatural object must.\n\n\"I don't eat lunch,\" said Selma.  \"But I'll stay if you'll put me next\nto you and let me talk to you.\"\n\nShe did not realize what an upsetting of order and precedence this\nrequest, which seemed so simple to her, involved.  Jane hesitated, but\nonly for a fraction of a second.  \"Why, certainly,\" said she.  \"Now\nthat I've got you I'd not let you go in any circumstances.\"\n\nSelma was gazing around at the other girls with the frank and pleased\ncuriosity of a child.  \"Gracious, what pretty clothes!\" she cried--she\nwas addressing Miss Clearwater, of Cincinnati. \"I've read about this\nsort of thing in novels and in society columns of newspapers.  But I\nnever saw it before.  ISN'T it interesting!\"\n\nMiss Clearwater, whose father was a United States Senator--by\npurchase--had had experience of many oddities, male and female. She\nalso was attracted by Selma's sparkling delight, and by the magnetic\ncharm which she irradiated as a rose its perfume. \"Pretty clothes are\nattractive, aren't they?\" said she, to be saying something.\n\n\"I don't know a thing about clothes,\" confessed Selma.  \"I've never\nowned at the same time more than two dresses fit to wear--usually only\none.  And quite enough for me.  I'd only be fretted by a lot of things\nof that kind.  But I like to see them on other people.  If I had my way\nthe whole world would be well dressed.\"\n\n\"Except you?\" said Ellen Clearwater with a smile.\n\n\"I couldn't be well dressed if I tried,\" replied Selma.  \"When I was a\nchild I was the despair of my mother.  Most of the people in the\ntenement where we lived were very dirty and disorderly--naturally\nenough, as they had no knowledge and no money and no time.  But mother\nhad ideas of neatness and cleanliness, and she used to try to keep me\nlooking decent.  But it was of no use.  Ten minutes after she had\nsmoothed me down I was flying every which way again.\"\n\n\"You were brought up in a tenement?\" said Miss Clearwater. Several of\nthe girls within hearing were blushing for Selma and were feeling how\ndistressed Jane Hastings must be.\n\n\"I had a wonderfully happy childhood,\" replied Selma.  \"Until I was old\nenough to understand and to suffer.  I've lived in tenements all my\nlife--among very poor people.  I'd not feel at home anywhere else.\"\n\n\"When I was born,\" said Miss Clearwater, \"we lived in a log cabin up in\nthe mining district of Michigan.\"\n\nSelma showed the astonishment the other girls were feeling.  But while\ntheir astonishment was in part at a girl of Ellen Clearwater's position\nmaking such a degrading confession, hers had none of that element in\nit.  \"You don't in the least suggest a log cabin or poverty of any\nkind,\" said she.  \"I supposed you had always been rich and beautifully\ndressed.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Ellen.  She gazed calmly round at the other girls\nwho were listening.  \"I doubt if any of us here was born to what you\nsee.  Of course we--some of us--make pretenses--all sorts of silly\npretenses.  But as a matter of fact there isn't one of us who hasn't\nnear relatives in the cabins or the tenements at this very moment.\"\n\nThere was a hasty turning away from this dangerous conversation. Jane\ncame back from ordering the rearrangement of her luncheon table.  Said\nSelma:\n\n\"I'd like to wash my hands, and smooth my hair a little.\"\n\n\"You take her up, Ellen,\" said Jane.  \"And hurry.  We'll be in the\ndining-room when you come down.\"\n\nSelma's eyes were wide and roving as she and Ellen went through the\ndrawing-room, the hall, up stairs and into the very prettily furnished\nsuite which Ellen was occupying.  \"I never saw anything like this\nbefore!\" exclaimed Selma.  \"It's the first time I was ever in a grand\nhouse.  This is a grand house, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No--it's only comfortable,\" replied Ellen.  \"Mr. Hastings--and Jane,\ntoo, don't go in for grandeur.\"\n\n\"How beautiful everything is--and how convenient!\" exclaimed Selma.  \"I\nhaven't felt this way since the first time I went to the circus.\"  She\npointed to a rack from which were suspended thin silk dressing gowns of\nvarious rather gay patterns.  \"What are those?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Dressing gowns,\" said Ellen.  \"Just to wear round while one is\ndressing or undressing.\"\n\nSelma advanced and felt and examined them.  \"But why so many?\" she\ninquired.\n\n\"Oh, foolishness,\" said Ellen.  \"Indulgence!  To suit different moods.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" murmured Selma.  \"Lovely!\"\n\n\"I suspect you of a secret fondness for luxury,\" said Ellen slyly.\n\nSelma laughed.  \"What would I do with such things?\" she inquired.\n\"Why, I'd have no time to wear them.  I'd never dare put on anything so\ndelicate.\"\n\nShe roamed through dressing-room, bedroom, bath-room, marveling,\ninquiring, admiring.  \"I'm so glad I came,\" said she.  \"This will give\nme a fresh point of view.  I can understand the people of your class\nbetter, and be more tolerant about them.  I understand now why they are\nso hard and so indifferent.  They're quite removed from the common lot.\nThey don't realize; they can't.  How narrow it must make one to have\none's life filled with these pretty little things for luxury and show.\nWhy, if I lived this life, I'd cease to be human after a short time.\"\n\nEllen was silent.\n\n\"I didn't mean to say anything rude or offensive,\" said Selma,\nsensitive to the faintest impressions.  \"I was speaking my thoughts\naloud....  Do you know David Hull?\"\n\n\"The young reformer?\" said Ellen with a queer little smile. \"Yes--quite\nwell.\"\n\n\"Does he live like this?\"\n\n\"Rather more grandly,\" said Ellen.\n\nSelma shook her head.  A depressed expression settled upon her\nfeatures.  \"It's useless,\" she said.  \"He couldn't possibly become a\nman.\"\n\nEllen laughed.  \"You must hurry,\" she said.  \"We're keeping everyone\nwaiting.\"\n\nAs Selma was making a few passes at her rebellious thick hair--passes\nthe like of which Miss Clearwater had never before seen--she explained:\n\n\"I've been somewhat interested in David Hull of late--have been hoping\nhe could graduate from a fake reformer into a useful citizen.  But--\"\nShe looked round expressively at the luxury surrounding them--\"one\nmight as well try to grow wheat in sand.\"\n\n\"Davy is a fine fraud,\" said Ellen.  \"Fine--because he doesn't in the\nleast realize that he's a fraud.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he is a fraud,\" said Selma setting on her hat again.  \"What\na pity?  He might have been a man, if he'd been brought up properly.\"\nShe gazed at Ellen with sad, shining eyes.  \"How many men and women\nluxury blights!\" she cried.\n\n\"It certainly has done for Davy,\" said Ellen lightly.  \"He'll never be\nanything but a respectable fraud.\"\n\n\"Why do YOU think so?\" Selma inquired.\n\n\"My father is a public man,\" Miss Clearwater explained.  \"And I've seen\na great deal of these reformers.  They're the ordinary human variety of\npolitician plus a more or less conscious hypocrisy.  Usually they're\nmen who fancy themselves superior to the common run in birth and\nbreeding.  My father has taught me to size them up.\"\n\nThey went down, and Selma, seated between Jane and Miss Clearwater,\namused both with her frank comments on the scene so strange to her--the\nbeautiful table, the costly service, the variety and profusion of\nelaborate food.  In fact, Jane, reaching out after the effects got\neasily in Europe and almost as easily in the East, but overtaxed the\nresources of the household which she was only beginning to get into\nwhat she  regarded as satisfactory order.  The luncheon, therefore, was\na creditable and promising attempt rather than a success, from the\nstandpoint of fashion.  Jane was a little ashamed, and at times\nextremely nervous--this when she saw signs of her staff falling into\ndisorder that might end in rout.  But Selma saw none of the defects.\nShe was delighted with the dazzling spectacle--for two or three\ncourses.  Then she lapsed into quiet and could not be roused to speak.\n\nJane and Ellen thought she was overwhelmed and had been seized of\nshyness in this company so superior to any in which she had ever found\nherself.  Ellen tried to induce her to eat, and, failing, decided that\nher refraining was not so much firmness in the two meals-a-day system\nas fear of making a \"break.\"  She felt genuinely sorry for the silent\ngirl growing moment by moment more ill-at-ease.  When the luncheon was\nabout half over Selma said abruptly to Jane:\n\n\"I must go now.  I've stayed longer than I should.\"\n\n\"Go?\" cried Jane.  \"Why, we haven't begun to talk yet.\"\n\n\"Another time,\" said Selma, pushing back her chair.  \"No, don't rise.\"\nAnd up she darted, smiling gayly round at the company.  \"Don't anybody\ndisturb herself,\" she pleaded. \"It'll be useless, for I'll be gone.\"\n\nAnd she was as good as her word.  Before any one quite realized what\nshe was about, she had escaped from the dining-room and from the house.\nShe almost ran across the lawn and into the woods. There she drew a\nlong breath noisily.\n\n\"Free!\" she cried, flinging out her arms.  \"Oh--but it was DREADFUL!\"\n\nMiss Hastings and Miss Clearwater had not been so penetrating as they\nfancied.  Embarrassment had nothing to do with the silence that had\ntaken possession of the associate editor of the New Day.\n\nShe was never self-conscious enough to be really shy.  She hastened to\nthe office, meeting Victor Dorn in the street doorway.  She cried:\n\n\"Such an experience!\"\n\n\"What now?\" said Victor.  He was used to that phrase from the ardent\nand impressionable Selma.  For her, with her wide-open eyes and ears,\nher vivid imagination and her thirsty mind, life was one closely packed\nseries of adventures.\n\n\"I had an hour to spare,\" she proceeded to explain.  \"I thought it was\na chance to further a little scheme I've got for marrying Jane Hastings\nand David Hull.\"\n\n\"Um!\" said Victor with a quick change of expression--which, however,\nSelma happened not to observe.\n\n\"And,\" she went on, \"I blundered into a luncheon party Jane was giving.\nYou never saw--you never dreamed of such style--such dresses and dishes\nand flowers and hats!  And I was sitting there with them, enjoying it\nall as if it were a circus or a ballet, when--Oh, Victor, what a silly,\nwhat a pitiful waste of time and money!  So much to do in the world--so\nmuch that is thrillingly interesting and useful--and those intelligent\nyoung people dawdling there at nonsense a child would weary of!  I had\nto run away.  If I had stayed another minute I should have burst out\ncrying--or denouncing them--or pleading with them to behave themselves.\"\n\n\"What else can they do?\" said Victor.  \"They don't know any better.\nThey've never been taught.  How's the article?\"\n\nAnd he led the way up to the editorial room and held her to the subject\nof the article he had asked her to write.  At the first opportunity she\nwent back to the subject uppermost in her mind. Said she:\n\n\"I guess you're right--as usual.  There's no hope for any people of\nthat class.  The busy ones are thinking only of making money for\nthemselves, and the idle ones are too enfeebled by luxury to think at\nall.  No, I'm afraid there's no hope for Hull--or for Jane either.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure about Miss Hastings,\" said Victor.\n\n\"You would have been if you'd seen her to-day,\" replied Selma. \"Oh, she\nwas lovely, Victor--really wonderful to look at.  But so obviously the\nidler.  And--body and soul she belongs to the upper class.  She\nunderstands charity, but she doesn't understand justice, and never\ncould understand it.  I shall let her alone hereafter.\"\n\n\"How harsh you women are in your judgments of each other,\" laughed\nDorn, busy at his desk.\n\n\"We are just,\" replied Selma.  \"We are not fooled by each other's\npretenses.\"\n\nDorn apparently had not heard.  Selma saw that to speak would be to\ninterrupt.  She sat at her own table and set to work on the editorial\nparagraphs.  After perhaps an hour she happened to glance at Victor.\nHe was leaning back in his chair, gazing past her out into the open; in\nhis face was an expression she had never seen--a look in the eyes, a\nrelaxing of the muscles round the mouth that made her think of him as a\nman instead of as a leader.  She was saying to herself.  \"What a\nfascinating man he would have been, if he had not been an incarnate\ncause.\"\n\nShe felt that he was not thinking of his work.  She longed to talk to\nhim, but she did not venture to interrupt.  Never in all the years she\nhad known him had he spoken to her--or to any one--a severe or even an\nimpatient word.  His tolerance, his good humor were infinite.\nYet--she, and all who came into contact with him, were afraid of him.\nThere could come, and on occasion there did come--into those\nextraordinary blue eyes an expression beside which the fiercest flash\nof wrath would be easy to face.\n\nWhen she glanced at him again, his normal expression had returned--the\nface of the leader who aroused in those he converted into\nfellow-workers a fanatical devotion that was the more formidable\nbecause it was not infatuated.  He caught her eye and said:\n\n\"Things are in such good shape for us that it frightens me.  I spend\nmost of my time in studying the horizon in the hope that I can foresee\nwhich way the storm's coming from and what it will be.\"\n\n\"What a pessimist you are!\" laughed Selma.\n\n\"That's why the Workingmen's League has a thick-and-thin membership of\nthirteen hundred and fifty,\" replied Victor. \"That's why the New Day\nhas twenty-two hundred paying subscribers.  That's why we grow faster\nthan the employers can weed our men out and replace them with\nimmigrants and force them to go to other towns for work.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said the girl, \"no matter what happens we can't be\nweeded out.\"\n\nVictor shook his head.  \"Our danger period has just begun,\" he replied.\n\"The bosses realize our power.  In the past we've been annoyed a little\nfrom time to time.  But they thought us hardly worth bothering with.\nIn the future we will have to fight.\"\n\n\"I hope they will prosecute us,\" said Selma.  \"Then, we'll grow the\nfaster.\"\n\n\"Not if they do it intelligently,\" replied Victor.  \"An intelligent\npersecution--if it's relentless enough--always succeeds.  You forget\nthat this isn't a world of moral ideas but of force....  I am afraid of\nDick Kelly.  He is something more than a vulgar boss.  He SEES.  My\nhope is that he won't be able to make the others see.  I saw him a\nwhile ago.  He was extremely polite to me--more so than he ever has\nbeen before.  He is up to something.  I suspect----\"\n\nVictor paused, reflecting.  \"What?\" asked Selma eagerly.\n\n\"I suspect that he thinks he has us.\"  He rose, preparing to go out.\n\"Well--if he has--why, he has.  And we shall have to begin all over\nagain.\"\n\n\"How stupid they are!\" exclaimed the girl.  \"To fight us who are simply\ntrying to bring about peaceably and sensibly what's bound to come about\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"Yes--the rain is bound to come,\" said Victor.  \"And we say, 'Here's an\numbrella and there's the way to shelter.'  And they laugh at OUR\numbrella and, with the first drops plashing on their foolish faces,\ndeny that it's going to rain.\"\n\nThe Workingmen's League, always first in the field with its ticket, had\nbeen unusually early that year.  Although it was only the first week in\nAugust and the election would not be until the third of October, the\nLeague had nominated.  It was a ticket made up entirely of skilled\nworkers who had lived all their lives in Remsen City and who had\nacquired an independence--Victor Dorn was careful not to expose to the\nfalling fire of the opposition any of his men who could be ruined by\nthe loss of a job or could be compelled to leave town in search of\nwork.  The League always went early into campaign because it pursued a\nmuch slower and less expensive method of electioneering than either of\nthe old parties--or than any of the \"upper class\" reform parties that\nsprang up from time to time and died away as they accomplished or\nfailed of their purpose--securing recognition for certain personal\nambitions not agreeable to the old established bosses. Besides, the\nLeague was, like the bosses and their henchmen, in politics every day\nin every year.  The League theory was that politics was as much a part\nof a citizen's daily routine as his other work or his meals.\n\nIt was the night of the League's great ratification meeting.  The next\nday the first campaign number--containing the biographical sketch of\nTony Rivers, Kelly's right-hand man ... would go upon the press, and on\nthe following day it would reach the public.\n\nMarket Square in Remsen City was on the edge of the power quarter, was\nsurrounded by cheap hotels, boarding houses and saloons.  A few years\nbefore, the most notable citizens, market basket on arm, could have\nbeen seen three mornings in the week, making the rounds of the stalls\nand stands, both those in the open and those within the Market House.\nBut customs had rapidly changed in Remsen City, and with the exception\nof a few old fogies only the poorer classes went to market.  The\nmasters of houses were becoming gentlemen, and the housewives were\nelevating into ladies--and it goes without saying that no gentleman and\nno lady would descend to a menial task even in private, much less in\npublic.\n\nMarket Square had even become too common for any but the inferior\nmeetings of the two leading political parties.  Only the Workingmen's\nLeague held to the old tradition that a political meeting of the first\nrank could be properly held nowhere but in the natural assembling place\nof the people--their market.  So, their first great rally of the\ncampaign was billed for Market Square.  And at eight o'clock, headed by\na large and vigorous drum corps, the Victor Dorn cohorts at their full\nstrength marched into the centre of the Square, where one of the stands\nhad been transformed with flags, bunting and torches into a speaker's\nplatform.  A crowd of many thousands accompanied and followed the\nprocession.  Workingmen's League meetings were popular, even among\nthose who believed their interests lay elsewhere.  At League meetings\none heard the plain truth, sometimes extremely startling plain truth.\nThe League had no favors to ask of anybody, had nothing to conceal, was\nstrongly opposed to any and all political concealments.  Thus, its\nspeakers enjoyed a freedom not usual in political speaking--and Dorn\nand his fellow-leaders were careful that no router, no exaggerator or\nwell intentioned wild man of any kind should open his mouth under a\nleague banner.  THAT was what made the League so dangerous--and so\nsteadily prosperous.\n\nThe chairman, Thomas Colman, the cooper, was opening the meeting in a\nspeech which was an instance of how well a man of no platform talent\ncan acquit himself when he believes something and believes it is his\nduty to convey it to his fellow-men.  Victor Dorn, to be the fourth\nspeaker and the orator of the evening, was standing at the rear of the\nplatform partially concealed by the crowd of men and women leaders of\nthe party grouped behind Colman.  As always at the big formal\ndemonstrations of the League, Victor was watching every move.  This\nevening his anxiety was deeper than ever before.  His trained political\nsagacity warned him that, as he had suggested to Selma, the time of his\nparty's first great crisis was at hand.  No movement could become\nformidable with out a life and death struggle, when its aim frankly was\nto snatch power from the dominant class and to place it where that\nclass could not hope to prevail either by direct means of force or by\nits favorite indirect means of bribery. What would Kelly do?  What\nwould be his stroke at the very life of the League?--for Victor had\nmeasured Kelly and knew he was not one to strike until he could destroy.\n\nLike every competent man of action, Victor had measured his own\nabilities, and had found that they were to be relied upon.  But the\ncontest between him and Kelly--the contest in the last ditch--was so\nappallingly unequal.  Kelly had the courts and the police, the moneyed\nclass, the employers of labor, had the clergy and well-dressed\nrespectability, the newspapers, all the customary arbiters of public\nsentiment.  Also, he had the criminal and the semi-criminal classes.\nAnd what had the League?\n\nThe letter of the law, guaranteeing freedom of innocent speech and\naction, guaranteeing the purity of the ballot--no, not guaranteeing,\nbut simply asserting those rights, and leaving the upholding of them\nto--Kelly's allies and henchmen!  Also, the League had the power of\nbetween a thousand and fifteen hundred intelligent and devoted men and\nabout the same number of women--a solid phalanx of great might, of\nmight far beyond its numbers. Finally, it had Victor Dorn.  He had no\nmean opinion of his value to the movement; but he far and most modestly\nunderestimated it. The human way of rallying to an abstract principle\nis by way of a standard bearer--a man--personality--a real or fancied\nincarnation of the ideal to be struggled for.  And to the Workingmen's\nLeague, to the movement for conquering Remsen City for the mass of its\ncitizens, Victor Dorn was that incarnation.\n\nKelly could use violence--violence disguised as law, violence candidly\nand brutally lawless.  Victor Dorn could only use lawful means--clearly\nand cautiously lawful means.  He must at all costs prevent the use of\nforce against him and his party--must give Kelly no pretext for using\nthe law lawlessly.  If Kelly used force against him, whether the\nperverted law of the courts or open lawlessness, he must meet it with\npeace.  If Kelly smote him on the right cheek he must give him the left\nto be smitten.\n\nWhen the League could outvote Kelly, then--another policy, still of\ncalmness and peace and civilization, but not so meek.  But until the\nLeague could outvote Kelly, nothing but patient endurance.\n\nEvery man in the League had been drilled in this strategy.  Every man\nunderstood--and to be a member of the League meant that one was\npolitically educated.  Victor believed in his associates as he believed\nin himself.  Still, human nature was human nature. If Kelly should\nsuddenly offer some adroit outrageous provocation--would the League be\nable to resist?\n\nVictor, on guard, studied the crowd spreading out from the platform in\na gigantic fan.  Nothing there to arouse suspicion; ten or twelve\nthousand of working class men and women.  His glance pushed on out\ntoward the edges of the crowd--toward the saloons and alleys of the\ndisreputable south side of Market Square.  His glance traveled slowly\nalong, pausing upon each place where these loungers, too far away to\nhear, were gathered into larger groups.  Why he did not know, but\nsuddenly his glance wheeled to the right, and then as suddenly to the\nleft--the west and the east ends of the square.  There, on either side\nhe recognized, in the farthest rim of the crowd, several of the men who\ndid Kelly's lowest kinds of dirty work--the brawlers, the repeaters,\nthe leaders of gangs, the false witnesses for petty corporation damage\ncases.  A second glance, and he saw or, perhaps, divined--purpose in\nthose sinister presences.  He looked for the police--the detail of a\ndozen bluecoats always assigned to large open-air meetings.  Not a\npoliceman was to be seen.\n\nVictor pushed through the crowd on the platform, advanced to the side\nof Colman.  \"Just a minute, Tom,\" he said.  \"I've got to say a word--at\nonce.\"\n\nColman had fallen back; Victor Dorn was facing the crowd--HIS\ncrowd--the men and women who loved him.  In the clear, friendly,\nnatural voice that marked him for the leader born, the honest leader of\nan honest cause, he said:\n\n\"My friends, if there is an attempt to disturb this meeting, remember\nwhat we of the League stand for.  No violence.  Draw away from every\ndisturber, and wait for the police to act.  If the police stop our\nmeeting, let them--and be ready to go to court and testify to the exact\nwords of the speaker on which the meeting was stopped.  Remember, we\nmust be more lawful than the law itself!\"\n\nHe was turning away.  A cheer was rising--a belated cheer, because his\nwords had set them all to thinking and to observing. From the left of\nthe crowd, a dozen yards away from the platform, came a stone heavily\nrather than swiftly flung, as from an impeded hand.  In full view of\nall it curved across the front of the platform and struck Victor Dorn\nfull in the side of the head.\n\nHe threw up his hands.\n\n\"Boys--remember!\" he shouted with a terrible energy--then, he staggered\nforward and fell from the platform into the crowd.\n\nThe stone was a signal.  As it flew, into the crowd from every\ndirection the Beech Hollow gangs tore their way, yelling and cursing\nand striking out right and left--trampling children, knocking down\nwomen, pouring out the foulest insults.  The street lamps all round\nMarket Square went out, the torches on the platform were torn down and\nextinguished.  And in a dimness almost pitch dark a riot that involved\nthat whole mass of people raged hideously.  Yells and screams and\ngroans, the shrieks of women, the piteous appeals of children--benches\ntorn up for weapons--mad slashing about--snarls and singings of\npain-stricken groups--then police whistles, revolvers fired in the air,\nand the quick, regular tramp of disciplined forces.  The\npolice--strangely ready, strangely inactive until the mischief had all\nbeen done entered the square from the north and, forming a double line\nacross it from east to west, swept it slowly clean.  The fighting ended\nas abruptly as it had begun.  Twenty minutes after the flight of that\nstone, the square was empty save a group of perhaps fifty men and women\nformed about Victor Dorn's body in the shelter of the platform.\n\nSelma Gordon was holding his head.  Jane Hastings and Ellen Clearwater\nwere kneeling beside him, and Jane was wiping his face with a\nhandkerchief wet with whisky from the flask of the man who had escorted\nthem there.\n\n\"He is only stunned,\" said Selma.  \"I can feel the beat of his blood.\nHe is only stunned.\"\n\nA doctor came, got down on his knees, made a rapid examination with\nexpert hands.  As he felt, one of the relighted torches suddenly lit up\nVictor's face and the faces of those bending over him.\n\n\"He is only stunned, Doctor,\" said Selma.\n\n\"I think so,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"We left our carriage in the side street just over there,\" said Jane\nHastings.  \"It will take him to the hospital.\"\n\n\"No--home,\" said Selma, who was calm.  \"He must be taken home.\"\n\n\"The hospital is the place for him,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"No--home,\" repeated Selma.  She glanced at the men standing round.\n\"Tom--Henry--and you, Ed--help me lift him.\"\n\n\"Please, Selma,\" whispered Jane.  \"Let him be taken to the hospital.\"\n\n\"Among our enemies?\" said Selma with a strange and terrible little\nlaugh.  \"Oh, no.  After this, we trust no one.  They may have arranged\nto finish this night's work there.  He goes home--doesn't he, boys?\"\n\n\"That's right, Miss Gordon,\" replied one of them.\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.  \"Here's where I drop the case,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" cried Jane imperiously.  \"I am Jane\nHastings--Martin Hastings' daughter.  You will come with us, please--or\nI shall see to it that you are not let off easily for such a shameful\nneglect of duty.\"\n\n\"Let him go, Jane,\" said Selma.  \"There will be a doctor waiting.  And\nhe is only stunned.  Come, boys--lift him up.\"\n\nThey laid him on a bench top, softened with the coats of his followers.\nAt the carriage, standing in Farwell Street, they laid him across the\ntwo seats.  Selma got in with him.  Tom Colman climbed to the box\nbeside the coachman.  Jane and Miss Clearwater, their escorts and about\na score of the Leaguers followed on foot.  As the little procession\nturned into Warner Street it was stopped by a policeman.\n\n\"Can't go down this way,\" he said.\n\n\"It's Mr. Dorn.  We're taking him home.  He was hurt,\" explained Colman.\n\n\"Fire lines.  Street's closed,\" said the policeman gruffly.\n\nSelma thrust her head out.  \"We must get him home----\"\n\n\"House across the street burning--and probably his house, too,\" cut in\nthe policeman.  \"He's been raising hell--he has.  But it's coming home\nto him at last.  Take him to the hospital.\"\n\n\"Jane,\" cried Selma, \"make this man pass us!\"\n\nJane faced the policeman, explained who she was.  He became humbly\ncivil at once.  \"I've just told her, ma'am,\" said he, \"that his house\nis burning.  The mob's gutting the New Day office and setting fire to\neverything.\"\n\n\"My house is in the next street,\" said Colman.  \"Drive there. Some of\nyou people get Dr. Charlton--and everything.  Get busy. Whip up,\ndriver.  Here, give me the lines!\"\n\nThus, within five minutes, Victor was lying upon a couch in the parlor\nof Colman's cottage, and within ten minutes Dr. Charlton was beside him\nand was at work.  Selma and Jane and Mrs. Colman were in the room.  The\nothers--a steadily increasing crowd--were on the steps outside, in the\nfront yard, were filling the narrow street.  Colman had organized fifty\nLeaguers into a guard, to be ready for any emergencies.  Over the tops\nof the low houses could be seen the vast cloud of smoke from the fire;\nthe air was heavy with the odors of burning wood; faintly came sounds\nof engines, of jubilant drunken shouts.\n\n\"A fracture of the skull and of the jaw-bone.  Not necessarily\nserious,\" was Dr. Charlton's verdict.\n\nThe young man, unconscious, ghastly pale, with his thick hair mussed\nabout his brow and on the right side clotted with blood, lay breathing\nheavily.  Ellen Clearwater came in and Mrs. Colman whispered to her the\ndoctor's cheering statement.  She went to Jane and said in an undertone:\n\n\"We can go now, Jane.  Come on.\"\n\nJane seemed not to hear.  She was regarding the face of the young man\non the couch.\n\nEllen touched her arm.  \"We're intruding on these people,\" she\nwhispered.  \"Let's go.  We've done all we can.\"\n\nSelma did not hear, but she saw and understood.\n\n\"Yes--you'd better go, Jane,\" she said.  \"Mrs. Colman and I will do\neverything that's necessary.\"\n\nJane did not heed.  She advanced a step nearer the couch.  \"You are\nsure, doctor?\" she said, and her voice sounded unnatural.\n\n\"Yes, miss----\"  He glanced at her face.  \"Yes, Miss Hastings. He'll be\nout in less than ten days, as good as ever.  It's a very simple affair.\"\n\nJane glanced round.  \"Is there a telephone?  I wish to send for Dr.\nAlban.\"\n\n\"I'd be glad to see him,\" said Dr. Charlton.  \"But I assure you it's\nunnecessary.\"\n\n\"We don't want Dr. Alban,\" said Selma curtly.  \"Go home, Jane, and let\nus alone.\"\n\n\"I shall go bring Dr. Alban,\" said Jane.\n\nSelma took her by the arm and compelled her into the hall, and closed\nthe door into the room where Victor lay.  \"You must go home, Jane,\" she\nsaid quietly.  \"We know what to do with our leader.  And we could not\nallow Dr. Alban here.\"\n\n\"Victor must have the best,\" said Jane.\n\nShe and Selma looked at each other, and Selma understood.\n\n\"He HAS  the best,\" said she, gentle with an effort.\n\n\"Dr. Alban is the best,\" said Jane.\n\n\"The most fashionable,\" said Selma.  \"Not the best.\"  With restraint,\n\"Go home.  Let us alone.  This is no place for you--for Martin\nHastings' daughter.\"\n\nJane, looking and acting like one in a trance, tried  to push past her\nand reenter the room.  Selma stood firm.  She said: \"If you do not go I\nshall have these men take you to your carriage.  You do not know what\nyou are doing.\"\n\nJane looked at her.  \"I love him,\" she said.\n\n\"So do we,\" said Selma.  \"And he belongs to US.  You must go. Come!\"\nShe seized her by the arm, and beckoning one of the waiting Leaguers to\nher assistance she pushed her quietly but relentlessly along the hall,\nout of the house, out of the yard and into the carriage.  Then she\nclosed the door, while Jane sank back against the cushions.\n\n\"Yes, he belongs to you,\" said Jane; \"but I love him.  Oh, Selma!\"\n\nSelma suddenly burst into tears.  \"Go, Jane, dear.  You MUST go,\" she\ncried.\n\n\"At least I'll wait here until--until they are sure,\" said Jane.  \"You\ncan't refuse me that, Selma.\"\n\n\"But they are sure,\" said Selma.  \"You must go with your friends.  Here\nthey come.\"\n\nWhen Ellen Clearwater and Joe Wetherbe--the second son of the chief\nowner of the First National--reached the curb, Selma said to Wetherbe:\n\n\"Please stand aside.  I've something to say to this lady.\"\n\nWhen Wetherbe had withdrawn, she said:  \"Miss Hastings is--not quite\nherself.  You had better take her home alone.\"\n\nJane leaned from the open carriage window.  \"Ellen,\" said she, \"I am\ngoing to stay here until Victor recovers consciousness, and I am SURE.\"\n\n\"He has just come around,\" said Ellen.  \"He is certain to get well.\nHis mind is clear.\"\n\n\"I must see for myself,\" cried Jane.\n\nSelma was preventing her leaving the carriage when Ellen quietly\ninterfered with a significant look for Selma.  \"Jane,\" she said, \"you\ncan't go in.  The doctor has just put every one out but his assistant\nand a nurse that has come.\"\n\nJane hesitated, drew back into the corner of the carriage. \"Tell Mr.\nWetherbe to go his own way,\" said Ellen aside to Selma, and she got in\nbeside Jane.\n\n\"To Mr. Hastings',\" said Selma to the driver.  The carriage drove away.\n\nShe gave Ellen's message to Wetherbe and returned to the house. Victor\nwas still unconscious; he did not come to himself until toward\ndaylight.  And then it was clear to them all that Dr. Charlton's\nencouraging diagnosis was correct.\n\nPublic opinion in Remsen City was publicly articulate by means of three\ndaily newspapers--the Pioneer, the Star, and the Free Press.  The Star\nand the Free Press were owned by the same group of capitalists who\ncontrolled the gas company and the water works.  The Pioneer was owned\nby the traction interests.  Both groups of capitalists were jointly\ninterested in the railways, the banks and in the principal factories.\nThe Pioneer was Republican, was regarded as the organ of Dick Kelly.\nThe Star was Democratic, spoke less cordially of Kelly and always\ncalled for House, Mr. House, or Joseph House, Esquire.  The Free Press\nposed as independent with Democratic leanings.  It indulged in\nadmirable essays against corruption, gang rule and bossism.  But it was\nnever specific and during campaigns was meek and mild. For nearly a\ndozen years there had not been a word of truth upon any subject\nimportant to the people of Remsen City in the columns of any of the\nthree.  During wars between rival groups of capitalists a half-truth\nwas now and then timidly uttered, but never a word of \"loose talk,\" of\n\"anarchy,\" of anything but the entirely \"safe, sane and conservative.\"\n\nThus, any one who might have witnessed the scenes in Market Square on\nThursday evening would have been not a little astonished to read the\naccounts presented the next day by the three newspapers.  According to\nall three the Workingmen's League, long a menace to the public peace,\nhad at last brought upon Remsen City the shame of a riot in which two\nmen, a woman and four children had lost their lives and more than a\nhundred, \"including the notorious Victor Dorn,\" had been injured.  And\nafter the riot the part of the mob that was hostile to \"the Dorn gang\"\nhad swept down upon the office of the New Day, had wrecked it, and had\nset fire to the building, with the result that five houses were burned\nbefore the flames could be put out.  The Free Press published, as a\nmere rumor, that the  immediate cause of the outbreak had been an\nimpending \"scurrilous attack\" in the New Day upon one of the political\ngangs of the slums and its leader.  The Associated Press, sending forth\nan account of the riot to the entire country, represented it as a fight\nbetween rival gangs of workmen precipitated by the insults and menaces\nof a \"socialistic party led by a young operator named Dorn.\" Dorn's\nfaction had aroused in the mass of the workingmen a fear that this\nspread of \"socialistic and anarchistic ideas\" would cause a general\nshut down of factories and a flight of the capital that was \"giving\nemployment to labor.\"\n\nA version of the causes and the events, somewhat nearer the truth, was\ntalked about Remsen City.  But all the respectable classes were well\ncontent with what their newspapers printed. And, while some\nbroad-minded respectabilities spoke of the affair as an outrage, none\nof them was disposed to think that any real wrong had been done.\nVictor Dorn and his crowd of revolutionists had got, after all, only\ntheir deserts.\n\nAfter forty-eight hours of careful study of public opinion, Dick Kelly\ndecided that Remsen City was taking the dose as he had anticipated.  He\nfelt emboldened to proceed to his final move in the campaign against\n\"anarchy\" in his beloved city.  On the second morning after the riot,\nall three newspapers published double-headed editorials calling upon\nthe authorities to safeguard the community against another such\ndegrading and dangerous upheaval.  \"It is time that the distinction\nbetween liberty and license be sharply drawn.\"  After editorials in\nthis vein had been repeated for several days, after sundry bodies of\neminently respectable citizens--the Merchants' Association, the\nTaxpayers' League, the Chamber of Commerce--had passed indignant and\nappealing resolutions, after two priests, a clergyman and four\npreachers had sermonized against \"the leniency of constituted authority\nwith criminal anarchy,\" Mr. Kelly had the City Attorney go before Judge\nLansing and ask for an injunction.\n\nJudge Lansing promptly granted the injunction.  The New Day was\nenjoined from appearing.  The Workingmen's League was enjoined from\nholding meetings.\n\nThen the County Prosecutor, also a henchman of Kelly's, secured from\nthe Grand Jury--composed of farmers, merchants and owners of\nfactories--indictments against Thomas Colman and Victor Dorn for\ninciting a riot.\n\nMeanwhile Victor Dorn was rapidly recovering.  With rare restraint\nyoung Dr. Charlton did not fuss and fret and meddle, did not hamper\nnature with his blundering efforts to assist, did not stuff\n\"nourishment\" into his patient to decay and to produce poisonous blood.\nHe let the young man's superb vitality work the inevitable and speedy\ncure.  Thus, wounds and shocks, that have often been mistreated by\ndoctors into mortal, passed so quickly that only Selma Gordon and the\ndoctor himself realized how grave Victor's case had been.  The day he\nwas indicted--just a week from the riot--he was sitting up and was\ntalking freely.\n\n\"Won't it set him back if I tell him all that has occurred?\" said Selma.\n\n\"Talk to him as you would to me,\" replied Charlton.  \"He is a sensible\nman.  I've already told him pretty much everything.  It has kept him\nfrom fretting, to be able to lie there quietly and make his plans.\"\n\nHad you looked in upon Victor and Selma, in Colman's little transformed\nparlor, you would rather have thought Selma the invalid.  The man in\nthe bed was pale and thin of face, but his eyes had the expression of\nhealth and of hope.  Selma had great circles under her eyes and her\nexpression was despair struggling to conceal itself.  Those\nindictments, those injunctions--how powerful the enemy were!  How could\nsuch an enemy, aroused new and inflexibly resolved, be\ncombatted?--especially when one had no money, no way of reaching the\npeople, no chance to organize.\n\n\"Dr. Charlton has told you?\" said Selma.\n\n\"Day before yesterday,\" replied Victor.  \"Why do you look so\ndown-in-the-mouth, Selma?\"\n\n\"It isn't easy to be cheerful, with you ill and the paper destroyed,\"\nreplied she.\n\n\"But I'm not ill, and the paper isn't destroyed,\" said Victor. \"Never\nwere either I or it doing such good work as now.\"  His eyes were\ndancing.  \"What more could one ask than to have such stupid enemies as\nwe've got?\"\n\nSelma did not lift her eyes.  To her those enemies seemed anything but\nstupid.  Had they not ruined the League?\n\n\"I see you don't understand,\" pursued Victor.  \"No matter. You'll wear\na very different face two weeks from now.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Selma, \"exactly what you said you were afraid of has\noccurred.  And now you say you're glad of it.\"\n\n\"I told you I was afraid Dick Kelly would make the one move that could\ndestroy us.\"\n\n\"But he has!\" cried Selma.\n\nVictor smiled.  \"No, indeed!\" replied he.\n\n\"What worse could he have done?\"\n\n\"I'll not tell you,\" said Victor.  \"I'd not venture to say aloud such a\ndangerous thing as what I'd have done if I had been in his place.\nInstead of doing that, he made us.  We shall win this fall's election.\"\n\nSelma lifted her head with a sudden gesture of hope.  She had unbounded\nconfidence in Victor Dorn, and his tone was the tone of absolute\nconfidence.\n\n\"I had calculated on winning in five years.  I had left the brutal\nstupidity of our friend Kelly out of account.\"\n\n\"Then you see how you can hold meetings and start up the paper?\"\n\n\"I don't want to do either,\" said Victor.  \"I want those injunctions to\nstand.  Those fools have done at a stroke what we couldn't have done in\nyears.  They have united the working class. They--the few--have\nforbidden us, the many, to unite or to speak. If those injunctions hold\nfor a month, nothing could stop our winning this fall....  I can't\nunderstand how Dick Kelly could be so stupid.  Five years ago these\nmoves of his would have been bad for us--yes, even three years ago.\nBut we've got too strong--and he doesn't realize!  Selma, when you want\nto win, always pray that your opponent will underestimate you.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand,\" said Selma.  \"None of us does. You must\nexplain to me, so that I'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"Do nothing,\" said Victor.  \"I shall be out a week from to-day.  I\nshall not go into the streets until I not only am well but look well.\"\n\n\"They arrested Tom Colman to-day,\" said Selma.  \"But they put the case\nover until you'd be able to plead at the same time.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Victor.  \"They are playing into our hands!\"  And\nhe laughed as heartily as his bandages would permit.\n\n\"Oh, I don't understand--I don't understand at all!\" cried Selma.\n\"Maybe you are all wrong about it.\"\n\n\"I was never more certain in my life,\" replied Victor.  \"Stop worrying\nabout it, my dear.\"  And he patted her hands gently as they lay folded\nin her lap.  \"I want you--all our people--to go round looking sad these\nnext few days.  I want Dick Kelly to feel that he is on the right\ntrack.\"\n\nThere came a knock at the door, and Mrs. Colman entered.  She had been\na school teacher, and of all the occupations there is no other that\nleaves such plain, such indelible traces upon manner, mind and soul.\nSaid she:\n\n\"Miss Jane Hastings is outside in her carriage--and wants to know if\nshe can see you.\"\n\nSelma frowned.  Victor said with alacrity:  \"Certainly.  Bring her in,\nMrs. Colman.\"\n\nSelma rose.  \"Wait until I can get out of the way,\" she cried.\n\n\"Sit down, and sit still,\" commanded Victor.\n\nSelma continued to move toward the door.  \"No--I don't wish to see\nher,\" she said.\n\nVictor chagrined her by acquiescing without another word. \"You'll look\nin after supper?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you want me,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Come back here,\" said Victor.  \"Wait, Mrs. Colman.\"  When Selma was\nstanding by the bed he took her hand.  \"Selma,\" he said, \"don't let\nthese things upset you.  Believe me, I'm right. Can't you trust me?\"\n\nSelma had the look of a wild creature detained against its will. \"I'm\nnot worried about the party--and the paper,\" she burst out.  \"I'm\nworried about you.\"\n\n\"But I'm all right.  Can't you see I'm almost well?\"\n\nSelma drew her hand away.  \"I'll be back about half-past seven,\" she\nsaid, and bolted from the room.\n\nVictor's good-natured, merry smile followed her to the door. When the\nsound of her retreat by way of the rear of the house was dying away he\nsaid to Mrs. Colman:\n\n\"Now--bring in the young lady.  And please warn her that she must stay\nat most only half an hour by that clock over there on the mantel.\"\n\nEvery day Jane had been coming to inquire, had been bringing or sending\nflowers and fruit--which, by Dr. Charlton's orders, were not supposed\nto enter the invalid's presence.  Latterly she had been asking to see\nVictor; she was surprised when Mrs. Colman returned with leave for her\nto enter.  Said Mrs. Colman:\n\n\"He's alone.  Miss Gordon has just gone.  You will see a clock on the\nmantel in his room.  You must not stay longer than half an hour.\"\n\n\"I shall be very careful what I say,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Oh, you needn't bother,\" said the ex-school teacher.  \"Dr. Charlton\ndoesn't believe in sick-room atmosphere.  You must treat Mr. Dorn\nexactly as you would a well person.  If you're going to take on, or put\non, you'd better not go in at all.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" said Jane, rather haughtily, for she did not like\nMrs. Colman's simple and direct manner.  She was used to being treated\nwith deference, especially by the women of Mrs. Colman's class; and\nwhile she disapproved of deference in theory, in practice she craved\nit, and expected it, and was irritated if she did not get it.  But, as\nshe realized how unattractive this weakness was, she usually took\nperhaps more pains than does the average person to conceal it.  That\nday her nerves were too tense for petty precautions.  However, Mrs.\nColman was too busy inspecting the details of Miss Hastings' toilet to\nnote Miss Hastings' manners.\n\nJane's nervousness vanished the instant she was in the doorway of the\nparlor with Victor Dorn looking at her in that splendidly simple and\nnatural way of his.  \"So glad to see you,\" he said. \"What a delightful\nperfume you bring with you.  I've noticed it before.  I know it isn't\nflowers, but it smells like flowers. With most perfumes you can smell\nthrough the perfume to something that's the very reverse of sweet.\"\n\nThey were shaking hands.  She said:  \"That nice woman who let me in\ncautioned me not to put on a sick-room manner or indulge in sick-room\ntalk.  It was quite unnecessary.  You're looking fine.\"\n\n\"Ain't I, though?\" exclaimed Victor.  \"I've never been so comfortable.\nJust weak enough to like being waited on.  You were very good to me the\nnight that stone knocked me over.  I want to thank you, but I don't\nknow how.  And the flowers, and the fruit--You have been so kind.\"\n\n\"I could do very little,\" said Jane, blushing and faltering. \"And I\nwanted to do--everything.\"  Suddenly all energy, \"Oh, Mr. Dorn, I heard\nand saw it all.  It was--INFAMOUS!  And the lying newspapers--and all\nthe people I meet socially.  They keep me in a constant rage.\"\n\nVictor was smiling gayly.  \"The fortunes of war,\" said he.  \"I expect\nnothing else.  If they fought fair they couldn't fight at all.  We, on\nthis side of the struggle, can afford to be generous and tolerant.\nThey are fighting the losing battle; they're trying to hold on to the\npast, and of course it's slipping from them inch by inch.  But we--we\nare in step with the march of events.\"\n\nWhen she was with him Jane felt that his cause was hers, also--was the\nonly cause.  \"When do you begin publishing your paper again?\" she\nasked.  \"As soon as you are sitting up?\"\n\n\"Not for a month or so,\" replied he.  \"Not until after the election.\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot about that injunction.  You think that as soon as Davy\nHull's crowd is in they will let you begin again?\"\n\nHe hesitated.  \"Not exactly that,\" he said.  \"But after the election\nthere will be a change.\"\n\nHer eyes flashed.  \"And they have indicted you!  I heard the newsboys\ncrying it and stopped and bought a paper.  But I shall do something\nabout that.  I am going straight from here to father.  Ellen Clearwater\nand I and Joe Wetherbe SAW.  And Ellen and I will testify if it's\nnecessary--and will make Joe tell the truth.  Do you know, he actually\nhad the impudence to try to persuade Ellen and me the next day that we\nsaw what the papers reported?\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" said Victor.  \"So I believe that Joe convinced himself.\"\n\n\"You are too charitable,\" replied Jane.  \"He's afraid of his father.\"\n\n\"Miss Hastings,\" said Victor, \"you suggested a moment ago that you\nwould influence your father to interfere in this matter of the\nindictment.\"\n\n\"I'll promise you now that he will have it stopped,\" said Jane.\n\n\"You want to help the cause, don't you?\"\n\nJane's eyes shifted, a little color came into her cheeks.  \"The\ncause--and you,\" she said.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Victor.  \"Then you will not interfere.  And if your\nfather talks of helping me you will discourage him all you can.\"\n\n\"You are saying that out of consideration for me.  You're afraid I will\nquarrel with my father.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Victor.  \"I can't tell you what I have\nin mind.  But I'll have to say this much--that if you did anything to\nhinder those fellows from carrying out their plans against me and\nagainst the League to the uttermost you'd be doing harm instead of\ngood.\"\n\n\"But they may send you to jail....  No, I forgot.  You can give bail.\"\n\nVictor's eyes had a quizzical expression.  \"Yes, I could give bail.\nBut even if I don't give bail, Miss Hastings--even if I am sent to\njail--Colman and I--still you must not interfere.  You promise me?\"\n\nJane hesitated.  \"I can't promise,\" she finally said.\n\n\"You must,\" said Victor.  \"You'll make a mess of my plans, if you\ndon't.\"\n\n\"You mean that?\"\n\n\"I mean that.  Your intentions are good.  But you would only do\nmischief--serious mischief.\"\n\nThey looked at each other.  Said Jane:  \"I promise--on one condition.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"That if you should change your mind and should want my help, you'd\npromptly and freely ask for it.\"\n\n\"I agree to that,\" said Victor.  \"Now, let's get it clearly in mind.\nNo matter what is done about me or the League, you promise not to\ninterfere in any way, unless I ask you to.\"\n\nAgain Jane hesitated.  \"No matter what they do?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"No matter what they do,\" insisted he.\n\nSomething in his expression gave her a great thrill of confidence in\nhim, of enthusiasm.  \"I promise,\" she said.  \"You know best.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do,\" said he.  \"Thank you.\"\n\nA moment's silence, then she exclaimed:  \"That was why you let me in\nto-day--because you wanted to get that promise from me.\"\n\n\"That was one of the reasons,\" confessed he.  \"In fact, it was the\nchief reason.\"  He smiled at her.  \"There's nothing I'm so afraid of as\nof enthusiasm.  I'm going to be still more cautious and exact another\npromise from you.  You must not tell any one that you have promised not\nto interfere.\"\n\n\"I can easily promise that,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Be careful,\" warned Victor.  \"A promise easily made is a promise\neasily forgotten.\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" said Jane.  \"You want them to attack you as\nsavagely as possible.  And you don't want them to get the slightest\nhint of your plan.\"\n\n\"A good guess,\" admitted Victor.  He looked at her gravely.\n\"Circumstances have let you farther into my confidence than any one\nelse is.  I hope you will not abuse it.\"\n\n\"You can rely upon me,\" said Jane.  \"I want your friendship and your\nrespect as I never wanted anything in my life before. I'm not afraid to\nsay these things to you, for I know I'll not be misunderstood.\"\n\nVictor's smile thrilled her again.  \"You were born one of us,\" he said.\n\"I felt it the first time we talked together.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I do want to be somebody,\" replied the girl.  \"I can't content\nmyself in a life of silly routine ... can't do things that have no\npurpose, no result.  And if it wasn't for my father I'd come out openly\nfor the things I believe in.  But I've got to think of him.  It may be\na weakness, but I couldn't overcome it. As long as my father lives I'll\ndo nothing that would grieve him. Do you despise me for that?\"\n\n\"I don't despise anybody for anything,\" said Victor.  \"In your place I\nshould put my father first.\"  He laughed.  \"In your place I'd probably\nbe a Davy Hull or worse.  I try never to forget that I owe everything\nto the circumstances in which I was born and brought up.  I've simply\ngot the ideas of my class, and it's an accident that I am of the class\nto which the future belongs--the working class that will possess the\nearth as soon as it has intelligence enough to enter into its kingdom.\"\n\n\"But,\" pursued Jane, returning to herself, \"I don't intend to be\naltogether useless.  I can do something and he--my father, I\nmean--needn't know.  Do you think that is dreadful?\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" said Victor.  But he said it in such a way that she\ndid not feel rebuked or even judged.\n\n\"Nor do I,\" said she.  \"I'd rather lead the life I wish to lead--say\nthe things I believe--do the things I believe in--all openly.  But I\ncan't.  And all I can do is to spend the income of my money my mother\nleft me--spend it as I please.\"  With a quick embarrassed gesture she\ntook an envelope from a small bag in which she was carrying it.\n\"There's some of it,\" she said. \"I want to give that to your campaign\nfund.  You are free to use it in any way you please--any way, for\neverything you are and do is your cause.\"\n\nVictor was lying motionless, his eyes closed.\n\n\"Don't refuse,\" she begged.  \"You've no right to refuse.\"\n\nA long silence, she watching him uneasily.  At last he said, \"No--I've\nno right to refuse.  If I did, it would be from a personal motive.  You\nunderstand that when you give the League this money you are doing what\nyour father would regard as an act of personal treachery to him?\"\n\n\"You don't think so, do you?\" cried she.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said he deliberately.\n\nHer face became deathly pale, then crimson.  She thrust the envelope\ninto the bag, closed it hastily.  \"Then I can't give it,\" she murmured.\n\"Oh--but you are hard!\"\n\n\"If you broke with your father and came with us--and it killed him, as\nit probably would,\" Victor Dorn went on, \"I should respect you--should\nregard you as a wonderful, terrible woman.  I should envy you having a\nheart strong enough to do a thing so supremely right and so supremely\nrelentless.  And I should be glad you were not of my blood--should\nthink you hardly human. Yet that is what you ought to do.\"\n\n\"I am not up to it,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Then you mustn't do the other,\" said Victor.  \"We need the money.  I\nam false to the cause in urging you not to give it. But--I'm human.\"\n\nHe was looking away, an expression in his eyes and about his mouth that\nmade him handsomer than she would have believed a man could be.  She\nwas looking at him longingly, her beautiful eyes swimming.  Her lips\nwere saying inaudibly, \"I love you--I love you.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" he asked, his thoughts returning from their far\njourney.\n\n\"My time is up,\" she exclaimed, rising.\n\n\"There are better ways of helping than money,\" said he, taking her\nhand.  \"And already you've helped in those ways.\"\n\n\"May I come again?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like.  But--what would your father say?\"\n\n\"Then you don't want me to come again?\"\n\n\"It's best not,\" said he.  \"I wish fate had thrown us on the same side.\nBut it has put us in opposite camps--and we owe it to ourselves to\nsubmit.\"\n\nTheir hands were still clasped.  \"You are content to have it so?\" she\nsaid sadly.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" cried he, dropping her hand.  \"But we are helpless.\"\n\n\"We can always hope,\" said she softly.\n\nOn impulse she laid her hand in light caress upon his brow, then\nswiftly departed.  As she stood in Mrs. Colman's flowery little front\nyard and looked dazedly about, it seemed to her that she had been away\nfrom the world--away from herself--and was reluctantly but inevitably\nreturning.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAs Jane drove into the grounds of the house on the hilltop she saw her\nfather and David Hull in an obviously intimate and agitated\nconversation on the front veranda.  She made all haste to join them;\nnor was she deterred by the reception she got--the reception given to\nthe unwelcome interrupter.  Said she:\n\n\"You are talking about those indictments, aren't you?  Everyone else\nis.  There's a group on every corner down town, and people are calling\ntheir views to each other from windows across the streets.\"\n\nDavy glanced triumphantly at her father.  \"I told you so,\" said he.\n\nOld Hastings was rubbing his hand over his large, bony, wizened face in\nthe manner that indicates extreme perplexity.\n\nDavy turned to Jane.  \"I've been trying to show your father what a\nstupid, dangerous thing Dick Kelly has done.  I want him to help me\nundo it.  It MUST be undone or Victor Dorn will sweep the town on\nelection day.\"\n\nJane's heart was beating wildly.  She continued to say carelessly, \"You\nthink so?\"\n\n\"Davy's got a bad attack of big red eye to-day,\" said her father.\n\"It's a habit young men have.\"\n\n\"I'm right, Mr. Hastings,\" cried Hull.  \"And, furthermore, you know I'm\nright, Jane; you saw that riot the other night.  Joe Wetherbe told me\nso.  You said that it was an absolutely unprovoked assault of the gangs\nof Kelly and House.  Everyone in town knows it was.  The middle and the\nupper class people are pretending to believe what the papers\nprinted--what they'd like to believe.  But they KNOW better.  The\nworking people are apparently silent.  They usually are apparently\nsilent.  But they know the truth--they are talking it among themselves.\nAnd these indictments will make Victor Dorn a hero.\"\n\n\"What of it?  What of it?\" said Hastings impatiently.  \"The working\npeople don't count.\"\n\n\"Not as long as we can keep them divided,\" retorted Davy. \"But if they\nunite----\"\n\nAnd he went on to explain what he had in mind.  He gave them an\nanalysis of Remsen City.  About fifty thousand inhabitants, of whom\nabout ten thousand were voters.  These voters were divided into three\nclasses--upper class, with not more than three or four hundred votes,\nand therefore politically of no importance AT THE POLLS, though\noverwhelmingly the most influential in any other way; the middle class,\nthe big and little merchants, the lawyers and doctors, the agents and\nfiremen and so on, mustering in all about two thousand votes; finally,\nthe working class with no less than eight thousand votes out of a total\nof ten thousand.\n\n\"By bribery and cajolery and browbeating and appeal to religious\nprejudice and to fear of losing jobs--by all sorts of chicane,\" said\nDavy, \"about seven of these eight thousand votes are kept divided\nbetween the Republican or Kelly party and the Democratic or House\nparty.  The other ten or twelve hundred belong to Victor Dorn's League.\nNow, the seven thousand workingmen voters who follow Kelly and House\nlike Victor Dorn, like his ideas, are with him at heart.  But they are\nafraid of him.  They don't trust each other.  Workingmen despise the\nworkingman as an ignorant fool.\"\n\n\"So he is,\" said Hastings.\n\n\"So he is,\" agreed Davy.  \"But Victor Dorn has about got the workingmen\nin this town persuaded that they'd fare better with Dorn and the League\nas their leaders than with Kelly and House as their leaders.  And if\nKelly goes on to persecute Victor Dorn, the workingmen will be\nfrightened for their rights to free speech and free assembly.  And\nthey'll unite.  I appeal to you, Jane--isn't that common sense?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about politics,\" said Jane, looking bored.  \"You\nmust go in and lie down before dinner, father.  You look tired.\"\n\nHastings got ready to rise.\n\n\"Just a minute, Mr. Hastings,\" pleaded Hull.  \"This must be settled\nnow--at once.  I must be in a position not only to denounce this thing,\nbut also to stop it.  Not to-morrow, but to-day ... so that the morning\npapers will have the news.\"\n\nJane's thoughts were flying--but in circles.  Everybody habitually\njudges everybody else as both more and less acute than he really is.\nJane had great respect for Davy as a man of college education.  But\nbecause he had no sense of humor and because he abounded in lengthy\nplatitudes she had thought poorly indeed of his abilities.  She had\nbeen realizing her mistake in these last few minutes.  The man who had\nmade that analysis of politics--an analysis which suddenly enlighted\nher as to what political power meant and how it was wielded everywhere\non earth as well as in Remsen City--the man was no mere dreamer and\ntheorist.  He had seen the point no less clearly than had Victor Dorn.\nBut what concerned her, what set her to fluttering, was that he was\nabout to checkmate Victor Dorn.  What should she say and do to help\nVictor?\n\nShe must get her father away.  She took him gently by the arm, kissed\nthe top of his head.  \"Come on, father,\" she cried. \"I'll let Davy work\nhis excitement off on me.  You must take care of your health.\"\n\nBut Hastings resisted.  \"Wait a minute, Jenny,\" said he.  \"I must\nthink.\"\n\n\"You can think lying down,\" insisted his daughter Davy was about to\ninterpose again, but she frowned him into silence.\n\n\"There's something in what Davy says,\" persisted her father. \"If that\nthere Victor Dorn should carry the election, there'd be no living in\nthe same town with him.  It'd put him away up out of reach.\"\n\nJane abruptly released her father's arm.  She had not thought of\nthat--of how much more difficult Victor would be if he won now. She\nwanted him to win ultimately--yes, she was sure she did. But--now?\nWouldn't that put him beyond her reach--beyond need of her?\n\nShe said:  \"Please come, father!\"  But it was perfunctory loyalty to\nVictor.  Her father settled back; Davy Hull began afresh, pressing home\nhis point, making his contention so clear that even Martin Hastings'\nprejudice could not blind him to the truth.  And Jane sat on the arm of\na big veranda chair and listened and made no further effort to\ninterfere.\n\n\"I don't agree with you, Hull,\" said the old man at last. \"Victor\nDorn's run up agin the law at last, and he ought to get the\nconsequences good and hard.  But----\"\n\n\"Mr. Hastings,\" interrupted Davy eagerly--too fond of talking to\nrealize that the old man was agreeing with him, \"Your daughter saw----\"\n\n\"Fiddle-fiddle,\" cried the old man.  \"Don't bring sentimental women\ninto this, Davy.  As I was saying, Victor ought to be punished for the\nway he's been stirring up idle, lazy, ignorant people against the men\nthat runs the community and gives 'em jobs and food for their children.\nBut maybe it ain't wise to give him his deserts--just now.  Anyhow,\nwhile you've been talking away like a sewing machine I've been\nthinking.  I don't see as how it can do any serious HARM to stop them\nthere indictments.\"\n\n\"That's it, Mr. Hastings,\" cried Hull.  \"Even if I do exaggerate, as\nyou seem to think, still where's the harm in doing it?\"\n\n\"It looks as if the respectable people were afraid of the lower\nclasses,\" said Hastings doubtfully.  \"And that's always bad.\"\n\n\"But it won't look that way,\" replied Davy, \"if my plan is followed.\"\n\n\"And what might be your plan?\" inquired Hastings.\n\n\"I'm to be the reform candidate for Mayor.  Your son-in-law, Hugo, is\nto be the reform candidate for judge.  The way to handle this is for me\nto come out in a strong statement denouncing the indictments, and the\ninjunction against the League and the New Day, too.  And I'll announce\nthat Hugo Galland is trying to join in the fight against them and that\nhe is indignant and as determined as I am.  Then early to-morrow\nmorning we can go before Judge Lansing and can present arguments, and\nhe will denounce the other side for misleading him as to the facts, and\nwill quash the indictments and vacate the injunctions.\"\n\nHastings nodded reflectively.  \"Pretty good,\" said he with a sly grin.\n\"And Davy Hull and my son-in-law will be popular heroes.\"\n\nDavy reddened.  \"Of course.  I want to get all the advantage I can for\nour party,\" said he.  \"I don't represent myself.  I represent the\nparty.\"\n\nMartin grinned more broadly.  He who had been representing \"honest\ntaxpayers\" and \"innocent owners\" of corrupt stock and bonds all his\nlife understood perfectly.  \"It's hardly human to be as unselfish as\nyou and I are, Davy,\" said he.  \"Well, I'll go in and do a little\ntelephoning.  You go ahead and draw up your statement and get it to the\npapers--and see Hugo.\"  He rose, stood leaning on his cane, all bent\nand shrivelled and dry.  \"I reckon Judge Lansing'll be expecting you\nto-morrow morning.\"  He turned to enter the house, halted, crooked his\nhead round for a piercing look at young Hull.  \"Don't go talking round\namong your friends about what you're going to do,\" said he sharply.\n\"Don't let NOBODY know until it's done.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Davy.\n\n\"I could see you hurrying down to that there University Club to sit\nthere and tell it all to those smarties that are always blowing about\nwhat they're going to do.  You'll be right smart of a man some day,\nDavy, if you'll learn to keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nDavy looked abashed.  He did not know which of his many indiscretions\nof self-glorifying talkativeness Mr. Hastings had immediately in mind.\nBut he could recall several, any one of which was justification for the\nrather savage rebuke--the more humiliating that Jane was listening.  He\nglanced covertly at her.\n\nPerhaps she had not heard; she was gazing into the distance with a\nstrange expression upon her beautiful face, an expression that fastened\nhis attention, absorbed though he was in his project for his own\nambitions.  As her father disappeared, he said:\n\n\"What are you thinking about, Jane?\"\n\nJane startled guiltily.  \"I?  Oh--I don't know--a lot of things.\"\n\n\"Your look suggested that you were having a--a severe attack of\nconscience,\" said he, laughingly.  He was in soaring good humor now,\nfor he saw his way clear to election.\n\n\"I was,\" said Jane, suddenly stern.  A pause, then she laughed--rather\nhollowly.  \"Davy, I guess I'm almost as big a fraud as you are.  What\nfakirs we human beings are?--always posing as doing for others and\nalways doing for our selfish selves.\"\n\nDavy's face took on its finest expression.  \"Do you think it's\naltogether selfishness for me to fight for Victor Dorn and give him a\nchance to get out his paper again--when he has warned me that he is\ngoing to print things that may defeat me?\"\n\n\"You know he'll not print them now,\" retorted Jane.\n\n\"Indeed I don't.  He's not so forbearing.\"\n\n\"You know he'll not print them now,\" repeated Jane.  \"He'd not be so\nfoolish.  Every one would forget to ask whether what he said about you\nwas true or false.  They'd think only of how ungenerous and ungrateful\nhe was.  He wouldn't be either.  But he'd seem to be--and that comes to\nthe same thing.\"  She glanced mockingly at Hull.  \"Isn't that your\ncalculation?\"\n\n\"You are too cynical for a woman, Jane,\" said Davy.  \"It's not\nattractive.\"\n\n\"To your vanity?\" retorted Jane.  \"I should think not.\"\n\n\"Well--good-by,\" said Davy, taking his hat from the rail. \"I've got a\nhard evening's work before me.  No time for dinner.\"\n\n\"Another terrible sacrifice for public duty,\" mocked Jane.\n\n\"You must be frightfully out of humor with yourself, to be girding at\nme so savagely,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Good-by, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\n\"I shall be--in six weeks.\"\n\nJane's face grew sombre.  \"Yes--I suppose so,\" said she.  \"The people\nwould rather have one of us than one of their own kind. They do look up\nto us, don't they?  It's ridiculous of them, but they do.  The idea of\nchoosing you, when they might have Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"He isn't running for Mayor,\" objected Hull.  \"The League's candidate\nis Harbinger, the builder.\"\n\n\"No, it's Victor Dorn,\" said Jane.  \"The best man in a party--the\nstrongest man--is always the candidate for all the offices.  I don't\nknow much about politics, but I've learned that much....  It's Victor\nDorn against--Dick Kelly--or Kelly and father.\"\n\nHull reddened.  She had cut into quick.  \"You will see who is Mayor\nwhen I'm elected,\" said he with all his dignity.\n\nJane laughed in the disagreeably mocking way that was the climax of her\nability to be nasty when she was thoroughly out of humor. \"That's\nright, Davy.  Deceive yourself.  It's far more comfortable.  So long!\"\n\nAnd she went into the house.\n\n\nDavy's conduct of the affair was masterly.  He showed those rare\nqualities of judgment and diplomacy that all but insure a man a\ndistinguished career.  His statement for the press was a model of\ndignity, of restrained indignation, of good common sense.  The most\ndifficult part of his task was getting Hugo Galland into condition for\na creditable appearance in court.  In so far as Hugo's meagre\nintellect, atrophied by education and by luxury, permitted him to be a\nlawyer at all, he was of that now common type called the corporation\nlawyer.  That is, for him human beings had ceased to exist, and of\ncourse human rights, also; the world as viewed from the standpoint of\nlaw contained only corporations, only interests.  Thus, a man like\nVictor Dorn was in his view the modern form of the devil--was a\ncombination of knave and lunatic who had no right to live except in the\nrestraint of an asylum or a jail.\n\nFortunately, while Hugo despised the \"hoi polloi\" as only a stupid,\nmiseducated snob can despise, he appreciated that they had votes and so\nmust be conciliated; and he yearned with the snob's famished yearning\nfor the title and dignity of judge. Davy found it impossible to\nconvince him that the injunctions and indictments ought to be attacked\nuntil he had convinced him that in no other way could he become Judge\nGalland.  As Hugo was fiercely prejudiced and densely stupid and\nreverent of the powers of his own intellect, to convince him was not\neasy.  In fact, Davy did not begin to succeed until he began to suggest\nthat whoever appeared before Judge Lansing the next morning in defense\nof free speech would be the Alliance and Democratic and Republican\ncandidate for judge, and that if Hugo couldn't see his way clear to\nappearing he might as well give up for the present his political\nambitions.\n\nHugo came round.  Davy left him at one o'clock in the morning and went\ngloomily home.  He had known what a prejudiced ass Galland was, how\nunfit he was for the office of judge; but he had up to that time hidden\nthe full truth from himself.  Now, to hide it was impossible.  Hugo had\nfully exposed himself in all his unfitness of the man of narrow upper\nclass prejudices, the man of no instinct or enthusiasm for right,\njustice and liberty. \"Really, it's a crime to nominate such a chap as\nthat,\" he muttered.  \"Yet we've got to do it.  How Selma Gordon's eyes\nwould shame me, if she could see me now!\"\n\nDavy had the familiar fondness for laying on the secret penitential\nscourge--wherewith we buy from our complacent consciences license to\nindulge in the sins our appetites or ambitions crave.\n\nJudge Lansing--you have never seen a man who LOOKED the judge more\nideally than did gray haired, gray bearded, open browed Robert\nLansing--Judge Lansing was all ready for his part in the farce.  He\nknew Hugo and helped him over the difficult places and cut him short as\nsoon as he had made enough of his speech to give an inkling of what he\nwas demanding.  The Judge was persuaded to deliver himself of a\nhigh-minded and eloquent denunciation of those who had misled the court\nand the county prosecutor.  He pointed out--in weighty judicial\nlanguage--that Victor Dorn had by his conduct during several years\ninvited just such a series of calamities as had beset him.  But he went\non to say that Dorn's reputation and fondness for speech and action\nbordering on the lawless did not withdraw from him the protection of\nthe law.  In spite of himself the law would protect him.  The\ninjunctions were dissolved and the indictments were quashed.\n\nThe news of the impending application, published in the morning papers,\nhad crowded the court room.  When the Judge finished a tremendous cheer\nwent up.  The cheer passed on to the throng outside, and when Davy and\nHugo appeared in the corridor they were borne upon the shoulders of\nworkingmen and were not released until they had made speeches.  Davy's\nmanly simplicity and clearness covered the stammering vagueness of hero\nGalland.\n\nAs Davy was gradually clearing himself of the eager handshakers and\nback-slappers, Selma suddenly appeared before him.  Her eyes were\nshining and her whole body seemed to be irradiating emotion of\nadmiration and gratitude.  \"Thank you--oh, thank you!\" she said,\npressing his hand.  \"How I have misjudged you!\"\n\nDavy did not wince.  He had now quite forgotten the part selfish\nambition had played in his gallant rush to the defense of imperilled\nfreedom--had forgotten it as completely as the now ecstatic Hugo had\nforgotten his prejudices against the \"low, smelly working people.\"  He\nlooked as exalted as he felt.  \"I only did my plain duty,\" replied he.\n\"How could any decent American have done less?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen Victor since yesterday afternoon,\" pursued Selma.  \"But\nI know how grateful he'll be--not so much for what you did as that YOU\ndid it.\"\n\nThe instinct of the crowd--the universal human instinct--against\nintruding upon a young man and young woman talking together soon\ncleared them of neighbors.  An awkward silence fell.  Said he\nhesitatingly:\n\n\"Are you ready to give your answer?--to that question I asked you the\nother day.\"\n\n\"I gave you my answer then,\" replied she, her glance seeking a way of\nescape.\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"For you said then that you would not marry me.  And I\nshall never take no for an answer until you have married some one else.\"\n\nShe looked up at him with eyes large and grave and puzzled. \"I'm sure\nyou don't want to marry me,\" she said.  \"I wonder why you keep asking\nme.\"\n\n\"I have to be honest with you,\" said Davy.  \"Somehow you bring out all\nthe good there is in me.  So, I can't conceal anything from you.  In a\nway I don't want to marry you.  You're not at all the woman I have\nalways pictured as the sort I ought to marry and would marry.\nBut--Selma, I love you.  I'd give up anything--even my career--to get\nyou.  When I'm away from you I seem to regain control of myself.  But\njust as soon as I see you, I'm as bad as ever again.\"\n\n\"Then we mustn't see each other,\" said she.\n\nSuddenly she nodded, laughed up at him and darted away--and Hugo\nGalland, long since abandoned by the crowd, had seized him by the arm.\n\nSelma debated whether to take Victor the news or to continue her walk.\nShe decided for the walk.  She had been feeling peculiarly toward\nVictor since the previous afternoon.  She had not gone back in the\nevening, but had sent an excuse by one of the Leaguers.  It was plain\nto her that Jane Hastings was up to mischief, and she had begun to\nfear--sacrilegious though she felt it to be to harbor such a\nsuspicion--that there was man enough, weak, vain, susceptible man\nenough, in Victor Dorn to make Jane a danger.  The more she had thought\nabout Jane and her environment, the clearer it had become that there\ncould be no permanent and deep sincerity in Jane's aspirations after\nemancipation from her class.  It was simply the old, old story of a\nwoman of the upper class becoming infatuated with a man of a genuine\nkind of manhood rarely found in the languor-producing surroundings of\nher own class.  Would Victor yield?  No! her loyalty indignantly\nanswered.  But he might allow this useless idler to hamper him, to\nweaken his energies for the time--and during a critical period.\n\nShe did not wish to see Victor again until she should have decided what\ncourse to take.  To think at her ease she walked out Monroe Avenue on\nher way to the country.  It was a hot day, but walking along in the\nbeautiful shade Selma felt no discomfort, except a slight burning of\nthe eyes from the fierce glare of the white highway.  In the distance\nshe heard the sound of an engine.\n\nA few seconds, and past her at high speed swept an automobile. Its\nheavy flying wheels tore up the roadway, raised an enormous cloud of\ndust.  The charm of the walk was gone; the usefulness of roadway and\nfootpaths was destroyed for everybody for the fifteen or twenty minutes\nthat it would take for the mass of dust to settle--on the foliage, in\nthe grass, on the bodies and clothing of passers-by and in their lungs.\nSelma halted and gazed after the auto.  Who was tearing along at this\nmad speed?  Who was destroying the comfort of all using that road, and\nannoying them and making the air unfit to breathe!  Why, an idle,\nluxuriously dressed woman, not on an errand of life or death, but going\ndown town to amuse herself shopping or calling.\n\nThe dust had not settled before a second auto, having a young man and\nyoung woman apparently on the way to play tennis, rushed by, swirling\nup even vaster clouds of dust and all but colliding with a baby\ncarriage a woman was trying to push across the street. Selma's blood\nwas boiling!  The infamy of it!  These worthless idlers!  What utter\nlack of manners, of consideration for their fellow beings.  A GENTLEMAN\nand a LADY insulting and bullying everyone who happened not to have an\nautomobile.  Then--she laughed.  The ignorant, stupid masses!  They\ndeserved to be treated thus contemptuously, for they could stop it if\nthey would.  \"Some day we shall learn,\" philosophized she.  \"Then these\nbrutalities of men toward each other, these brutalities big and little,\nwill cease.\"  This matter of the insulting automobiles, with insolent\nhorns and criminal folly of speed and hurling dust at passers-by, worse\nthan if the occupants had spat upon them in passing--this matter was a\ntrifle beside the hideous brutalities of men compelling masses of their\nfellow beings, children no less than grown people, to toil at things\nkilling soul, mind and body simply in order that fortunes might be\nmade! THERE was lack of consideration worth thinking about.\n\nThree more autos passed--three more clouds of dust, reducing Selma to\nextreme physical discomfort.  Her philosophy was severely strained.\nShe was in the country now; but even there she was pursued by these\ninsolent and insulting hunters of pleasure utterly indifferent to the\ncomfort of their fellows. And when a fourth auto passed, bearing Jane\nHastings in a charming new dress and big, becoming hat--Selma, eyes and\nthroat full of dust and face and neck and hands streaked and dirty,\nquite lost her temper.  Jane spoke; she turned her head away,\npretending not to see!\n\nPresently she heard an auto coming at a less menacing pace from the\nopposite direction.  It drew up to the edge of the road abreast of her.\n\"Selma,\" called Jane.\n\nSelma paused, bent a frowning and angry countenance upon Jane.\n\nJane opened the door of the limousine, descended, said to her\nchauffeur:  \"Follow us, please.\"  She advanced to Selma with a timid\nand deprecating smile.  \"You'll let me walk with you?\" she said.\n\n\"I am thinking out a very important matter,\" replied Selma, with frank\nhostility.  \"I prefer not to be interrupted.\"\n\n\"Selma!\" pleaded Jane.  \"What have I done to turn you against me?\"\n\nSelma stood, silent, incarnation of freedom and will.  She looked\nsteadily at Jane.  \"You haven't done anything,\" she replied. \"On\nimpulse I liked you.  On sober second thought I don't. That's all.\"\n\n\"You gave me your friendship,\" said Jane.  \"You've no right to withdraw\nit without telling me why.\"\n\n\"You are not of my class.  You are of the class that is at war with\nmine--at war upon it.  When you talk of friendship to me, you are\neither false to your own people or false in your professions to me.\"\n\nSelma's manner was rudely offensive--as rude as Jane's dust, to which\nit was perhaps a retort.  Jane showed marvelous restraint. She told\nherself that she felt compassionate toward this attractive, honest,\nreally nice girl.  It is possible, however, that an instinct of\nprudence may have had something to do with her ultra-conciliatory\nattitude toward the dusty little woman in the cheap linen dress.  The\nenmity of one so near to Victor Dorn was certainly not an advantage.\nInstead of flaring up, Jane said:\n\n\"Now, Selma--do be human--do be your sweet, natural self.  It isn't my\nfault that I am what I am.  And you know that I really belong heart and\nsoul with you.\"\n\n\"Then come with us,\" said Selma.  \"If you think the life you lead is\nfoolish--why, stop leading it.\"\n\n\"You know I can't,\" said Jane mournfully.\n\n\"I know you could,\" retorted Selma.  \"Don't be a hypocrite, Jane.\"\n\n\"Selma--how harsh you are!\" cried Jane.\n\n\"Either come with us or keep away from us,\" said the girl inflexibly.\n\"You may deceive yourself--and men--with that talk of broad views and\nhigh aspirations.  But you can't deceive another woman.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to deceive anybody,\" exclaimed Jane angrily. \"Permit me\nto say, Selma, that your methods won't make many converts to your\ncause.\"\n\n\"Who ever gave you the idea that we were seeking converts in your\nclass?\" inquired Selma.  \"Our whole object is to abolish your\nclass--and end its drain upon us--and its bad example--and make its\nmembers useful members of our class, and more contented and happier\nthan they are now.\"  She laughed--a free and merry laugh, but not\npleasant in Jane's ears.  \"The idea of US trying to induce young ladies\nand young gentlemen with polished finger nails to sit round in\ndrawing-rooms talking patronizingly of doing something for the masses!\nYou've got a very queer notion of us, my dear Miss Hastings.\"\n\nJane's eyes were flashing.  \"Selma, there's a devil in you to-day.\nWhat is it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"There's a great deal of dust from your automobile in me and on me,\"\nsaid Selma.  \"I congratulate you on your good manners in rushing about\nspattering and befouling your fellow beings and threatening their\nlives.\"\n\nJane colored and lowered her head.  \"I--I never thought of that\nbefore,\" she said humbly.\n\nSelma's anger suddenly dissolved.  \"I'm ashamed of myself,\" she cried.\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\nWhat she had said about the automobile had made an instant deep\nimpression upon Jane, who was honestly trying to live up to her\naspirations--when she wasn't giving up the effort as hopelessly beyond\nher powers and trying to content herself with just aspiring.  She was\nnot hypocritical in her contrition.  The dust disfiguring the foliage,\nstreaking Selma's face and hair, was forcing the lesson in manners\nvigorously home.  \"I'm much obliged to you for teaching me what I ought\nto have learned for myself,\" she said.  \"I don't blame you for scorning\nme.  I am a pretty poor excuse.  But\"--with her most charming\nsmile--\"I'll do better--all the faster if you'll help me.\"\n\nSelma looked at her with a frank, dismayed contrition, like a child\nthat realizes it has done something very foolish.  \"Oh, I'm so horribly\nimpulsive!\" she cried.  \"It's always getting me into trouble.  You\ndon't know how I try Victor Dorn's patience--though he never makes the\nleast sign.\"  She laughed up at Jane.  \"I wish you'd give me a\nwhipping.  I'd feel lots better.\"\n\n\"It'd take some of my dust off you,\" said Jane.  \"Let me take you to\nthe house in the auto--you'll never see it going at that speed again, I\npromise.  Come to the house and I'll dust you off--and we'll go for a\nwalk in the woods.\"\n\nSelma felt that she owed it to Jane to accept.  As they were climbing\nthe hill in the auto, Selma said:\n\n\"My, how comfortable this is!  No wonder the people that have autos\nstop exercising and get fat and sick and die.  I couldn't trust myself\nwith one.\"\n\n\"It's a daily fight,\" confessed Jane.  \"If I were married and didn't\nhave to think about my looks and my figure I'm afraid I'd give up.\"\n\n\"Victor says the only time one ought ever to ride in a carriage is to\nhis own funeral.\"\n\n\"He's down on show and luxury of every kind--isn't he?\" said Jane.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Selma.  \"Victor isn't 'down on' anything.  He\nthinks show and luxury are silly.  He could be rich if he wished, for\nhe has wonderful talent for managing things and for making money.  He\nhas refused some of the most wonderful offers--wonderful in that way.\nBut he thinks money-making a waste of time.  He has all he wants, and\nhe says he'd as soon think of eating a second dinner when he'd just had\none as of exchanging time that could be LIVED for a lot of foolish\ndollars.\"\n\n\"And he meant it, too,\" said Jane.  \"In some men that would sound like\npretense.  But not in him.  What a mind he has--and what a character!\"\n\nSelma was abruptly overcast and ominously silent.  She wished she had\nnot been turned so far by her impulse of penitence--wished she had held\nto the calm and deliberate part of her resolve about Jane--the part\nthat involved keeping aloof from her.  However, Jane, the\ntactful--hastened to shift the conversation to generalities of the\nsoftest kinds--talked about her college life--about the inane and\nuseless education they had given her--drew Selma out to talk about her\nown  education--in the tenement--in the public school, at night school,\nin factory and shop.  Not until they had been walking in the woods\nnearly two hours and Selma was about to go home, did Victor, about whom\nboth were thinking all the time, come into the conversation again.  It\nwas Jane who could no longer keep away from the subject--the one\nsubject that wholly interested her nowadays.  Said she:\n\n\"Victor Dorn is REALLY almost well, you think?\"\n\nAfter a significant pause Selma said in a tone that was certainly not\nencouraging, \"Obviously.\"\n\n\"I was altogether wrong about Doctor Charlton,\" said Jane. \"I'm\nconvinced now that he's the only really intelligent doctor in town.\nI'm trying to persuade father to change to him.\"\n\n\"Well, good-by,\" said Selma.  She was eager to get away, for she\nsuddenly felt that Jane was determined to talk about Victor before\nletting her go.\n\n\"You altered toward me when I made that confession--the night of the\nriot,\" said Jane abruptly.  \"Are you in love with him, too?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Selma.\n\n\"I don't see how you could help being,\" cried Jane.\n\n\"That's because you don't know what it is to be busy,\" retorted Selma.\n\"Love--what you call love--is one of the pastimes with your sort of\npeople.  It's a lazy, easy way of occupying the thoughts.\"\n\n\"You don't know me as well as you think you do,\" said Jane. Her\nexpression fascinated Selma--and made her more afraid than ever.\n\nImpulsively Selma took Jane by the arm.  \"Keep away from us,\" she said.\n\"You will do no good.  You can only cause unhappiness--perhaps most of\nall to yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't I know that!\" exclaimed Jane.  \"I'm fighting it as hard as I\ncan.  But how little control one has over oneself when one has always\nbeen indulged and self-indulgent.\"\n\n\"The man for you is David Hull,\" said Selma.\n\n\"You could help him--could make a great deal of a person out of him.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" replied Jane.  \"But I don't want him, and he--perhaps you\ndidn't know that he is in love with you?\"\n\n\"No more than you are with Victor Dorn,\" said Selma.  \"I'm different\nfrom the women he has known, just as Victor is different from the men\nyou meet in your class.  But this is a waste of time.\"\n\n\"You don't believe in me at all,\" cried Jane.  \"In some ways you are\nvery unjust and narrow, Selma.\"\n\nSelma looked at her in that grave way which seemed to compel frankness.\n\"Do YOU believe in yourself?\" she asked.\n\nJane's glance shifted.\n\n\"You know you do not,\" proceeded Selma.  \"The women of your class\nrarely have sincere emotions because they do not lead sincere lives.\nPart of your imaginary love for Victor Dorn is desire to fill up idle\nhours.  The rest of it is vanity--the desire to show your power over a\nman who seems to be woman-proof.\"  She laughed a little, turned away,\npaused.  \"My mother used to quote a French proverb--'One cannot trifle\nwith love.'  Be careful, Jane--for your own sake.  I don't know whether\nyou could conquer Victor Dorn or not.  But I do know IF you could\nconquer him it would be only at the usual price of those conquests to a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" said Jane.\n\n\"Your own complete surrender,\" said Selma.\n\n\"How wise you are!\" laughed Jane.  \"Who would have suspected you of\nknowing so much!\"\n\n\"How could I--a woman--and not unattractive to men--grow up to be\ntwenty-one years old, in the free life of a working woman, without\nlearning all there is to know about sex relations?\"\n\nJane looked at her with a new interest.\n\n\"And,\" she went on, \"I've learned--not by experience, I'm glad to say,\nbut by observation--that my mother's proverb is true.  I shall not\nthink about love until I am compelled to.  That is a peril a sensible\nperson does not seek.\"\n\n\"I did not seek it,\" cried Jane--and then she halted and flushed.\n\n\"Good-by, Jane,\" said Selma, waving her hand and moving away rapidly.\nShe called back--\"On ne badine pas avec l'amour!\"\n\nShe went straight to Colman's cottage--to Victor, lying very pale with\nhis eyes shut, and big Tom Colman sitting by his bed.  There was a\nstillness in the room that Selma felt was ominous. Victor's\nhand--strong, well-shaped, useful-looking, used-looking--not\nABUSED-looking, but USED-looking-was outside the covers upon the white\ncounterpane.  The fingers were drumming softly; Selma knew that\ngesture--a certain sign that Victor was troubled in mind.\n\n\"You've told him,\" said Selma to Colman as she paused in the doorway.\n\nVictor turned his head quickly, opened his eyes, gave her a look of\nwelcome that made her thrill with pride.  \"Oh--there you are!\" he\nexclaimed.  \"I was hoping you'd come.\"\n\n\"I saw David Hull just after it was done,\" said Selma.  \"And I thanked\nhim for you.\"\n\nVictor's eyes had a look of amusement, of mockery.  \"Thank you,\" he\nsaid.\n\nShe, the sensitive, was on the alert at once.  \"Didn't you want me to\nthank him?\"\n\nVictor did not answer.  In the same amused way he went on:  \"So they\ncarried him on their shoulders--him and that other defender of the\nrights of the people, Hugo Galland?  I should like to have seen.  It\nwas a memorable spectacle.\"\n\n\"You are laughing at it,\" exclaimed the girl.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"You certainly are taking the news very queer, Victor,\" said Colman.\nThen to Selma, \"When I told him he got white and I thought I'd have to\nsend for Doctor Charlton.\"\n\n\"Well--joy never kills,\" said Victor mockingly.  \"I don't want to keep\nyou, Tom--Selma'll sit with me.\"\n\nWhen they were alone, Victor again closed his eyes and resumed that\nsilent drumming upon the counterpane.  Selma watched the restless\nfingers as if she hoped they would disclose to her the puzzling secret\nof Victor's thoughts.  But she did not interrupt.\n\nThat was one lesson in restraint that Victor had succeeded in teaching\nher--never to interrupt.  At last he heaved a great sigh and said:\n\n\"Well, Selma, old girl--we've probably lost again. I was glad you came\nbecause I wanted to talk--and I can't say what's in my mind before dear\nold Tom--or any of them but my sister and you.\"\n\n\"You didn't want those injunctions and indictments out of the way?\"\nsaid Selma.\n\n\"If they had stood, we'd have won--in a walk,\" replied Victor. \"As the\ncards lie now, David Hull will win.  And he'll make a pretty good show\nmayor, probably--good enough to fool a large majority of our fellow\ncitizens, who are politically as shallow and credulous as nursery\nchildren.  And so--our work of educating them will be the harder and\nslower.  Oh, these David Hulls!--these good men who keep their mantles\nspotless in order to make them the more useful as covers for the dirty\nwork of others!\" Suddenly his merry smile burst out.  \"And they carried\nHugo Galland on their shoulders?\"\n\n\"Then you don't think Hull's motives were honorable?\" inquired Selma,\nperplexed and anxious.\n\n\"How could I know his motives?--any man's motives?\" replied Victor.\n\"No one can read men's hearts.  All I ever consider is actions.  And\nthe result of his actions is probably the defeat of the League and the\nelection of Dick Kelly.\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" said Selma thoughtfully.  \"But--I do believe\nhis motive was altogether good.\"\n\n\"My dear girl,\" said Victor, \"the primer lesson in the life of action\nis:  'Never--NEVER look at motives.  Action--only actions--always\nactions.'  The chief reason the human race is led patiently round by\nthe nose is its fondness for fussing about motives.  We are interested\nonly in men's actions and the results to our cause.  Davy Hull's\nmotives concern only himself--and those who care for him.\"  Victor's\neyes, twinkling mischievously, shot a shrewd glance at Selma.  \"You're\nnot by any chance in love with Davy?\"\n\nSelma colored high.  \"Certainly not!\" she exclaimed indignantly.\n\n\"Why not?  Why not?\" teased Victor.  \"He's tall and handsome--and\nsuperbly solemn--and women always fancy a solemn man has intellect and\ncharacter.  Not that Davy is a fool--by no means.  I'd be the last man\nto say that--I whom he has just cleverly checkmated in one move.\"\n\n\"You intended not to give bail!  You intended to go to jail!\" exclaimed\nSelma abruptly.  \"I see it all!  How stupid I was! Oh, I could cry,\nVictor!  What a chance.\"\n\n\"Spilt milk,\" said Victor.  \"We must forget it, and plan to meet the\nnew conditions.  We'll start the paper at once.  We can't attack him.\nVery clever of him--very clever!  If he were as brave as he is shrewd,\nI'd almost give up hope of winning this town while he was in politics\nhere.  But he lacks courage.  And he daren't think and speak honestly.\nHow that does cripple a man!\"\n\n\"He'll be one of us before very long,\" said Selma.  \"You misjudge him,\nVictor.\"\n\nDorn smiled.  \"Not so long as his own class gratifies his ambitions,\"\nreplied Victor.  \"If he came with us it'd be because his own class had\nfailed him and he hoped to rise through and upon--ours.\"\n\nSelma did not agree with him.  But as she always felt presumptuous and\neven foolish in disagreeing with Victor, she kept silent.  And\npresently Victor began to lay out her share in the task of starting up\nthe New Day.  \"I shall be all right within a week,\" said he, \"and we\nmust get the first number out the week following.\"  She was realizing\nnow that Hull's move had completely upset an elaborate plan of campaign\ninto which Victor had put all his intelligence and upon which he had\nstaked all his hopes.  She marvelled as he talked, unfolding rapidly an\nentirely new campaign, different in every respect from what the other\nwould have been.  How swiftly his mind had worked, and how well! How\nlittle time he had wasted in vain regrets!  How quickly he had\nrecovered from a reverse that would have halted many a strong man.\n\nAnd then she remembered how they all, his associates, were like him,\nproof against the evil effects of set-back and defeat.  And why were\nthey so?  Because Victor Dorn had trained them to fight for the cause,\nand not for victory.  \"Our cause is the right, and in the end right is\nbound to win because the right is only another name for the\nsensible\"--that had been his teaching.  And a hardy army he had\ntrained.  The armies trained by victory are strong; but the armies\nschooled by defeat--they are invincible.\n\nWhen he had explained his new campaign--as much of it as he deemed it\nwise at that time to withdraw from the security of his own brain--she\nsaid:\n\n\"But it seems to me we've got a good chance to win, anyhow.\"\n\n\"A chance, perhaps,\" replied he.  \"But we'll not bother about that.\nAll we've got to do is to keep on strengthening ourselves.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it!\" she cried.  \"One added here--five there--ten yonder.\nEvery new stone fitted solidly against the ones already in place.\"\n\n\"We must never forget that we aren't merely building a new party,\" said\nDorn.  \"We're building a new civilization--one to fit the new\nconditions of life.  Let the Davy Hulls patch and tinker away at trying\nto keep the old structure from falling in. We know it's bound to fall\nand that it isn't fit for decent civilized human beings to live in.\nAnd we're getting the new house ready.  So--to us, election day is no\nmore important than any of the three hundred and sixty-five.\"\n\n\nIt was into the presence of a Victor Dorn restored in mind as well as\nin body that Jane Hastings was shown by his sister, Mrs. Sherrill, one\nafternoon a week or so later.\n\nAll that time Jane had been searching for an excuse for going to see\nhim.  She had haunted the roads and the woods where he and Selma\nhabitually walked.  She had seen neither of them.  When the pretext for\na call finally came to her, as usual, the most obvious thing in the\nworld.  He must be suspecting her of having betrayed his confidence and\nbrought about the vacating of those injunctions and the quashing of the\nindictments.  She must go to him and clear herself of suspicion.\n\nShe felt that the question of how she should dress for this crucial\ninterview, this attempt to establish some sort of friendly relations\nwith him, was of the very highest importance. Should she wear something\nplain, something that would make her look as nearly as might be like\none of his own class?  HIS class!\n\nNo--no, indeed.  The class in which he was accidentally born and bred,\nbut to which he did not belong.  Or, should she go dressed frankly as\nof her own class--wearing the sort of things that made her look her\nfinest and most superior and most beautiful? Having nothing else to do,\nshe spent several hours in trying various toilets.  She was not long in\ndeciding against disguising herself as a working woman.  That garb\nmight win his mental and moral approval; but not by mental and moral\nways did women and men prevail with each other.  In plain garb--so Jane\ndecided, as she inspected herself--she was no match for Selma Gordon;\nshe looked awkward, out of her element.  So much being settled, there\nremained to choose among her various toilets.  She decided for an\nembroidered white summer dress, extremely simple, but in the way that\ncosts beyond the power of any but the very rich to afford. When she was\nready to set forth, she had never looked so well in her life.  Her\ntoilet SEEMED a mere detail.  In fact, it was some such subtlety as\nthose arrangements of lines and colors in great pictures, whereby the\nglance of the beholder is unconsciously compelled toward the central\nfigure, just as water in a funnel must go toward the aperture at the\nbottom.  Jane felt, not without reason, that she had executed a stroke\nof genius.  She was wearing nothing that could awaken Victor Dorn's\nprejudices about fine clothes, for he must have those prejudices.  Yet\nshe was dressed in conformity with all that centuries, ages of\nexperience, have taught the dressmaking art on the subject of feminine\nallure.  And, when a woman feels that she is so dressed, her natural\nallure becomes greatly enhanced.\n\nShe drove down to a point in Monroe Avenue not far from the house where\nVictor and his family lived.  The day was hot; boss-ridden Remsen City\nhad dusty and ragged streets and sidewalks.  It, therefore, would not\ndo to endanger the freshness of the toilet. But she would arrive as if\nshe had come all the way on foot. Arrival in a motor at so humble a\nhouse would look like ostentation; also, if she were seen going through\nthat street afoot, people would think she was merely strolling a little\nout of her way to view the ruins of the buildings set on fire by the\nmob.  She did pause to look at these ruins; the air of the neighborhood\nstill had a taint of burnt wood and paper. Presently, when she was sure\nthe street was clear of people of the sort who might talk--she hastily\nentered the tiny front yard of Victor's house, and was pleased to find\nherself immediately screened from the street by the luxuriant bushes\nand creepers.\n\nThere was nothing in the least pretentious about the appearance of the\nlittle house.  It was simply a well built cottage--but of brick,\ninstead of the usual wood, and the slate roof descended at attractive\nangles.  The door she was facing was superior to the usual\nflimsy-looking door.  Indeed, she at once became conscious of a highly\nattractive and most unexpected air of substantiality and good taste.\nThe people who lived here seemed to be permanent people--long resident,\nand looking forward to long residence. She had never seen such\nbeautiful or such tastefully grouped sun flowers, and the dahlias and\nmarigolds were far above the familiar commonplace kitchen garden\nflowers.\n\nThe door opened, and a handsome, extremely intelligent looking woman,\nobviously Victor's sister, was looking pleasantly at her. Said she:\n\"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.  But I was busy in the kitchen.\nThis is Miss Hastings, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jane, smiling friendlily.\n\n\"I've heard my brother and Selma talk of you.\"  (Jane wondered WHAT\nthey had said.)  \"You wish to see Victor?\"\n\n\"If I'd not be interrupting,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Come right in.  He's used to being interrupted.  They don't give him\nfive minutes to himself all day long--especially now that the\ncampaign's on.  He always does his serious work very early in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThey went through a hall, pleasantly odorous of baking in which good\nflour and good butter and good eggs were being manufactured into\nsomething probably appetizing, certainly wholesome.  Jane caught a\nglimpse through open doors on either side of a neat and reposeful\nlittle library-sitting room, a plain delightfully simple little\nbedroom, a kitchen where everything shone.  She arrived at the rear\ndoor somehow depressed, bereft of the feeling of upper-class\nsuperiority which had, perhaps unconsciously, possessed her as she came\ntoward the house.  At the far end of an arbor on which the grape vines\nwere so trellised that their broad leaves cast a perfect shade, sat\nVictor writing at a table under a tree.  He was in his shirt sleeves,\nand his shirt was open at the throat.  His skin was smooth and\nhealthily white below the collar line.  The forearms exposed by his\nrolled up sleeves were strong but slender, and the faint fair hair upon\nthem suggested a man, but not an animal.\n\nNever had she seen his face and head so fine.  He was writing rapidly,\nhis body easily erect, his head and neck in a poise of grace and\nstrength.  Jane grew pale and trembled--so much so that she was afraid\nthe keen, friendly eyes of Alice Sherrill were seeing.  Said Mrs.\nSherrill, raising her voice:\n\n\"Victor--here's Miss Hastings come to see you.\"  Then to Jane: \"Excuse\nme, please.  I don't dare leave that kitchen long.\"\n\nShe departed.  Jane waited while Victor, his pencil reluctantly\nslackening and his glance lingeringly rising from the paper, came back\nto sense of his surroundings.  He stared at her blankly, then colored a\nlittle.  He rose--stiff, for him formal.  Said he:\n\n\"How d'you do, Miss Hastings?\"\n\nShe came down the arbor, recovering her assurance as she again became\nconscious of herself, so charmingly dressed and no doubt beautiful in\nhis eyes.  \"I know you're not glad to see me,\" said she.  \"But I'm only\nstopping a very little minute.\"\n\nHis eyes had softened--softened under the influence of the emotion no\nman can ever fail to feel at least in some degree at sight of a lovely\nwoman.  \"Won't you sit?\" said he, with a glance at the wooden chair\nnear the other side of the table.\n\nShe seated herself, resting one gloved hand on the prettily carved end\nof her white-sunshade.  She was wearing a big hat of rough black straw,\nwith a few very gorgeous white plumes.  \"What a delightful place to\nwork,\" exclaimed she, looking round, admiring the flowers, the slow\nripening grapes, the delicious shade.  \"And you--how WELL you look!\"\n\n\"I've forgotten I was ever anything but well,\" said he.\n\n\"You're impatient for me to go,\" she cried laughing.  \"It's very rude\nto show it so plainly.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied he.  \"I am not impatient for you to go.  But I ought to\nbe, for I'm very busy.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall be gone in a moment.  I came only to tell you that you\nare suspecting me wrongly.\"\n\n\"Suspecting you?--of what?\"\n\n\"Of having broken my word.  I know you must think I got father to set\nDavy Hull on to upsetting your plans.\"\n\n\"The idea never entered my head,\" said he.  \"You had promised--and I\nknow you are honest.\"\n\nJane colored violently and lowered her eyes.  \"I'm not--not up to what\nyou say,\" she protested.  \"But at least I didn't break my promise.\nDavy thought of that himself.\"\n\n\"I have been assuming so.\"\n\n\"And you didn't suspect me?\"\n\n\"Not for an instant,\" Victor assured her.  \"Davy simply made the move\nthat was obviously best for him.\"\n\n\"And now he will be elected,\" said Jane regretfully.\n\n\"It looks that way,\" replied Victor.  And he had the air of one who has\nnothing more to say.\n\nSuddenly Jane looked at him with eyes shining and full of appeal.\n\n\"Don't send me away so quickly,\" she pleaded.  \"I've not been telling\nthe exact truth.  I came only partly because I feared you were\nsuspecting me.  The real reason was that--that I couldn't stay away any\nlonger.  I know you're not in the least interested in me----\"\n\nShe was watching him narrowly for signs of contradiction.  She hoped\nshe had not watched in vain.\n\n\"Why should you be?\" she went on.  \"But ever since you opened my eyes\nand set me to thinking, I can do nothing but think about the things you\nhave said to me, and long to come to you and ask you questions and hear\nmore.\"\n\nVictor was staring hard into the wall of foliage.  His face was set.\nShe thought she had never seen anything so resolute, so repelling as\nthe curve of his long jaw bone.\n\n\"I'll go now,\" she said, making a pretended move toward rising.\n\n\"I've no right to annoy you.\"\n\nHe stood up abruptly, without looking at her.  \"Yes, you'd better go,\"\nhe said curtly.\n\nShe quivered--and it was with a pang of genuine pain.\n\nHis gaze was not so far from her as it seemed.  For he must have noted\nher expression, since he said hurriedly:  \"I beg your pardon.  It isn't\nthat I mean to be rude.  I--I--it is best that I do not see you.\"\n\nShe sank back in the chair with a sigh.  \"And I--I know that I ought to\nkeep away from you.  But--I can't.  It's too strong for me.\"\n\nHe looked at her slowly.  \"I have made up my mind to put you out of my\nhead,\" he said.  \"And I shall.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried.  \"Victor--don't!\"\n\nHe sat again, rested his forearms upon the table, leaned toward her.\n\"Look at me,\" he said.\n\nShe slowly lifted her gaze to his, met it steadily.  \"I thought so,\nVictor,\" she said tenderly.  \"I knew I couldn't care so much unless you\ncared at least a little .\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said he.  \"I don't know.  I doubt if either of us is in love\nwith the other.  Certainly, you are not the sort of woman I could\nlove--deeply love.  What I feel for you is the sort of thing that\npasses.  It is violent while it lasts, but it passes.\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" cried she recklessly.  \"Whatever it is I want it!\"\n\nHe shook his head resolutely.  \"No,\" he said.  \"You don't want it, and\nI don't want it.  I know the kind of life you've mapped out for\nyourself--as far as women of your class map out anything. It's the only\nkind of life possible to you.  And it's of a kind with which I could,\nand would, have nothing to do.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" protested she.  \"You could make of me what you\npleased.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"I couldn't make a suit of overalls out of a length of\nsilk.  Anyhow, I have made up my life with love and marriage left out.\nThey are excellent things for some people, for most people.  But not\nfor me.  I must be free, absolutely free.  Free to think only of the\ncause I've enlisted in, free to do what it commands.\"\n\n\"And I?\" she said with tremendous life.  \"What is to become of me,\nVictor?\"\n\nHe laughed quietly.  \"You are going to keep away from me--find some one\nelse to amuse your leisure.  That's what's going to become of you, Jane\nHastings.\"\n\nShe winced and quivered again.  \"That--hurts,\" she said.\n\n\"Your vanity?  Yes.  I suppose it does.  But those wounds are\nhealthful--when the person is as sensible as you are.\"\n\n\"You think I am not capable of caring!  You think I am vain and shallow\nand idle.  You refuse me all right to live, simply because I happen to\nlive in surroundings you don't approve of.\"\n\n\"I'm not such an egotistical ass as to imagine a woman of your sort\ncould be genuinely in love with a man of my sort,\" replied he.  \"So,\nI'll see to it that we keep away from each other.  I don't wish to be\ntempted to do you mischief.\"\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly.\n\nBut he did not explain.  He said:  \"And you are going now.  And we\nshall not meet again except by accident.\"\n\nShe gave a sigh of hopelessness.  \"I suppose I have lowered myself in\nyour eyes by being so frank--by showing and speaking what I felt,\" she\nsaid mournfully.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" rejoined he.  \"A man who is anybody or has anything\nsoon gets used to frankness in women.  I could hardly have gotten past\nthirty, in a more or less conspicuous position, without having had some\nexperience.... and without learning not to attach too much importance\nto--to frankness in women.\"\n\nShe winced again.  \"You wouldn't say those things if you knew how they\nhurt,\" she said.  \"If I didn't care for you, could I sit here and let\nyou laugh at me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you could,\" answered he.  \"Hoping somehow or other to turn the\nlaugh upon me later on.  But really I was not laughing at you.  And you\ncan spare yourself the effort of convincing me that you're sincere.\"\nHe was frankly laughing at her now. \"You don't understand the\nsituation--not at all.  You fancy that I am hanging back because I am\noverwhelmed or shy or timid.  I assure you I've never been shy or timid\nabout anything I wanted. If I wanted you--I'd--TAKE you.\"\n\nShe caught her breath and shrank.  Looking at him as he said that,\ncalmly and confidently, she, for the first time, was in love--and was\nafraid.  Back to her came Selma's warnings:  \"One may not trifle with\nlove.  A woman conquers only by surrender.\"\n\n\"But, as I said to you a while ago,\" he went on, \"I don't want you--or\nany woman.  I've no time for marriage--no time for a flirtation.  And\nthough you tempt me strongly, I like you too well to--to treat you as\nyou invite.\"\n\nJane sat motionless, stunned by the sudden turning of the tables.\n\nShe who had come to conquer--to amuse herself, to evoke a strong,\nhopeless passion that would give her a delightful sense of warmth as\nshe stood safely by its bright flames--she had been conquered.\n\nShe belonged to this man; all he had to do was to claim her.\n\nIn a low voice, sweet and sincere beyond any that had ever come from\nher lips before, she said:\n\n\"Anything, Victor--anything--but don't send me away.\"\n\nAnd he, seeing and hearing, lost his boasted self-control. \"Go--go,\" he\ncried harshly.  \"If you don't go----\"  He came round the table, seizing\nher as she rose, kissed her upon the lips, upon the eyes.  \"You are\nlovely--lovely!\" he murmured. \"And I who can't have flowers on my table\nor in sight when I've got  anything serious to do--I love your perfume\nand your color and the wonderful softness of you----\"\n\nHe pushed her away.  \"Now--will you go?\" he cried.\n\nHis eyes were flashing.  And she was trembling from head to foot.\n\nShe was gazing at him with a fascinated expression.  \"I understand what\nyou meant when you warned me to go,\" she said. \"I didn't believe it,\nbut it was so.\"\n\n\"Go--I tell you!\" he ordered.\n\n\"It's too late,\" said she.  \"You can't send me away now--for you have\nkissed me.  If I'm in your power, you're in my power, too.\"\n\nMoved by the same impulse both looked up the arbor toward the rear door\nof the house.  There stood Selma Gordon, regarding them with an\nexpression of anger as wild as the blood of the steppes that flowed in\nher veins.  Victor, with what composure he could master, put out his\nhand in farewell to Jane.  He had been too absorbed in the emotions\nraging between him and her to note Selma's expression.  But Jane, the\nwoman, had seen.  As she shook hands with Victor, she said neither high\nnor low:\n\n\"Selma knows that I care.  I told her the night of the riot.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" said Victor in a tone she thought it wise not to dispute.\n\n\"I'll be in the woods above the park at ten tomorrow,\"  she said in an\nundertone.  Then to Selma, unsmilingly:  \"You're not interrupting.  I'm\ngoing.\"  Selma advanced.  The two girls looked frank hostility into\neach other's eyes.  Jane did not try to shake hands with her.  With a\nnod and a forced smile of conventional friendliness upon her lips, she\npassed her and went through the house and into the street.\n\nShe lingered at the gate, opening and closing it in a most leisurely\nfashion--a significantly different exit from her furtive and ashamed\nentrance.  Love and revolt were running high and hot in her veins.  She\nlonged openly to defy the world--her world.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nImpulse was the dominant strain in Selma Gordon's character--impulse\nand frankness.  But she was afraid of Victor Dorn as we all are afraid\nof those we deeply respect--those whose respect is the mainstay of our\nself-confidence.  She was moving toward him to pour out the violence\nthat was raging in her on the subject of this flirtation of Jane\nHastings.  The spectacle of a useless and insincere creature like that\ntrifling with her deity, and being permitted to trifle, was more than\nshe could endure. But Victor, dropping listlessly to his chair and\nreaching for his pencil, was somehow a check upon her impetuousness.\nShe paused long enough to think the sobering second thought.  To speak\nwould be both an impertinence and a folly.  She owed it to the cause\nand to her friend Victor to speak; but to speak at the wrong time and\nin the wrong way would be worse than silence.\n\nSaid he:  \"I was finishing this when she came.  I'll be done in a\nminute.  Please read what I've written and tell me what you think.\"\n\nSelma took up the loose sheets of manuscript and stood reading his\ninaugural of the new New Day.  As she read she forgot the petty matter\nthat had so agitated her a moment before.  This salutatory--this\naddress to the working class--this plan of a campaign to take Remsen\nCity out of the hands of its exploiters and despoilers and make it a\ncity fit for civilized residence and worthy of its population of\nintelligent, progressive workingmen--this leading editorial for the\nfirst number was Victor Dorn at his greatest and best.  The man of\naction with all the enthusiasm of a dreamer.  The shrewd, practical\npolitician with the outlook of a statesman.  How honest and impassioned\nhe was; yet how free from folly and cant.  Several times as she read\nSelma lifted her eyes to look at him in generous, worshipful\nadmiration.  She would not have dared let him see; she would not have\ndared speak the phrases of adoration of his genius that crowded to her\nlips.  How he would have laughed at her--he who thought about himself\nas a personality not at all, but only as an instrument.\n\n\"Here's the rest of it,\" said he, throwing himself back in his chair\nand relighting his pipe.\n\nShe finished a moment later, said as she laid the manuscript on the\ntable:  \"That's the best you've ever done.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" agreed he.  \"It seems to me I've got a new grip on\nthings.  I needed a turn such as your friend Davy Hull gave me.\nNothing like rivalry to spur a man on.  The old crowd was so\nstupid--cunning, but stupid.  But Hull injects a new element into the\nstruggle.  To beat him we've got to use our best brains.\"\n\n\"We've got to attack him,\" said Selma.  \"After all, he is the enemy.\nWe can't let him disarm us by an act of justice.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Victor.  \"But we'll have to be careful. Here's what\nI'm going to carry on the first page.\"\n\nHe held up a sheet of paper on which he had written with a view to\neffective display the names of the four most offensive local\ncorporations with their contribution--$25,000 each--to the campaign\nfund of the Citizens' Alliance.  \"Under it, in big type,\" proceeded he,\n\"we'll carry a line asking, 'Is the Citizens' Alliance fooling these\nfour corporations or is it fooling the people?'  I think that will be\nmore effective than columns of attack.\"\n\n\"We ought to get that out on wall-bills and dodgers,\" suggested Selma,\n\"and deluge the town with it once or twice a week until election.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" exclaimed Victor.  \"I'll make a practical politician of you\nyet.\"\n\nColman and Harbinger and Jocelyn and several others of the League\nleaders came in one at a time, and the plan of campaign was developed\nin detail.  But the force they chiefly relied upon was the influence of\ntheir twelve hundred men, their four or five thousand women and young\nmen and girls, talking every day and evening, each man or woman or\nyouth with those with whom he came into contact.  This \"army of\neducation\" was disciplined, was educated, knew just what arguments to\nuse, had been cautioned against disputes, against arousing foolish\nantagonisms.  The League had nothing to conceal, no object to gain but\nthe government of Remsen City by and for its citizens--well paved, well\nlighted, clean streets, sanitary houses, good and clean street car\nservice, honest gas, pure water, plenty of good schools--that first of\nall.  The \"reform crowd\"--the Citizens' Alliance--like every reform\nparty of the past, proposed to do practically the same things.  But the\nLeague met this with: \"Why should we elect an upper class government to\ndo for us what we ought to do for ourselves?  And how can they redeem\ntheir promises when they are tied up in a hundred ways to the very\npeople who have been robbing and cheating us?\"\n\nThere were to be issues of the New Day; there were to be posters and\ndodgers, public meetings in halls, in squares, on street corners.  But\nthe main reliance now as always was this educated \"army of\neducation\"--these six thousand missionaries, each one of them in\nresolute earnest and bent upon converting his neighbors on either side,\nand across the street as well.  A large part of the time the leaders\ncould spare from making a living was spent in working at this army, in\nteaching it new arguments or better ways of presenting old arguments,\nin giving the enthusiasm, in talking with each individual soldier of it\nand raising his standard of efficiency.  Nor could the employers of\nthese soldiers of Victor Dorn's complain that they shirked their work\nfor politics.  It was a fact that could not be denied that the members\nof the Workingmen's League were far and away the best workers in Remsen\nCity, got the best pay, and earned it, drank less, took fewer days off\non account of sickness.  One of the sneers of the Kelly-House gang was\nthat \"those Dorn cranks think they are aristocrats, a little better\nthan us common, ordinary laboring men.\"  And the sneer was not without\neffect.  The truth was, Dorn and his associates had not picked out the\nbest of the working class and drawn it into the League, but had made\nthose who joined the League better workers, better family men, better\ncitizens.\n\n\"We are saying that the working class ought to run things,\" Dorn said\nagain and again in his talks, public and private. \"Then, we've got to\nshow the community that we're fit to run things.  That is why the\nLeague expels any man who shirks or is a drunkard or a crook or a bad\nhusband and father.\"\n\nThe great fight of the League--the fight that was keeping it from\npower--was with the trades unions, which were run by secret agents of\nthe Kelly-House oligarchy.  Kelly and the Republican party rather\nfavored \"open shop\" or \"scab\" labor--the right of an American to let\nhis labor to whom he pleased on what terms he pleased.  The Kelly\norators waxed almost tearful as they contemplated the outrage of any\ninterference with the ancient liberty of the American citizen.  Kelly\ndisguised as House was a hot union man.  He loathed the \"scab.\"  He\njeered at the idea that a laborer ought to be at the mercy of the\npowerful employer who could dictate his own terms, which the laborers\nmight not refuse under stress of hunger.  Thus the larger part of the\n\"free\" labor in Remsen City voted with Kelly--was bought by him at so\nmuch a head.  The only organization it had was under the Kelly district\ncaptains.  Union labor was almost solidly Democratic--except in\nPresidential elections, when it usually divided on the tariff question.\n\nAlthough almost all the Leaguers were members of the unions, Kelly and\nHouse saw to it that they had no influence in union councils.  That is,\nuntil recently Kelly-House had been able to accomplish this.  But they\nwere seeing the approaching end of their domination.  The \"army of\neducation\" was proving too powerful for them.  And they felt that at\nthe coming election the decline of their power would be\napparent--unless something drastic were done.\n\nThey had attempted it in the riot.  The riot had been a fizzle--thanks\nto the interposition of the personal ambition of the until then\ndespised \"holy boy,\" David Hull.  Kelly, the shrewd, at once saw the\nmark of the man of force.  He resolved that Hull should be elected.  He\nhad intended simply to use him to elect Hugo Galland judge and to split\nup the rest of the tickets in such a way that some Leaguers and some\nreformers would get in, would be powerless, would bring discredit and\nridicule upon their parties.  But Hull was a man who could be useful;\nhis cleverness in upsetting the plot against Dorn and turning all to\nhis advantage demonstrated that.  Therefore, Hull should be elected and\npassed up higher.  It did not enter his calculations that Hull might\nprove refractory, might really be all that he professed; he had talked\nwith Davy, and while he had underestimated his intelligence, he knew he\nhad not misjudged his character.  He knew that it was as easy to \"deal\"\nwith the Hull stripe of honest, high minded men as it was difficult to\n\"deal\" with the Victor Dorn stripe.  Hull he called a \"sensible\nfellow\"; Victor Dorn he called a crank.  But--he respected Dorn, while\nHull he held in much such esteem as he held his cigar-holder and pocket\nknife, or Tony Rivers and Joe House.\n\nWhen Victor Dorn had first begun to educate and organize the people of\nRemsen City, the boss industry was in its early form. That is, Kelly\nand House were really rivals in the collecting of big campaign funds by\nvarious forms of blackmail, in struggling for offices for themselves\nand their followers, in levying upon vice and crime through the police.\nIn these ways they made the money, the lion's share of which naturally\nfell to them as leaders, as organizers of plunder.  But that stage had\nnow passed in Remsen City as it had passed elsewhere, and the boss\nindustry had taken a form far more difficult to combat.  Kelly and\nHouse no longer especially cared whether Republican party or Democratic\nwon.  Their business--their source of revenue--had ceased to be through\ncarrying elections, had become a matter of skill in keeping the people\nmore or less evenly divided between the two \"regular\" parties, with an\noccasional fake third party to discourage and bring into contempt\nreform movers and to make the people say, \"Well, bad as they are, at\nleast the regulars aren't addle-headed, damn fools doing nothing except\nto make business bad.\"  Both Kelly and House were supported and\nenriched by the corporations and by big public contracting companies\nand by real estate deals.  Kelly still appropriated a large part of the\n\"campaign fund.\"  House, in addition, took a share of the money raised\nby the police from dives.  But these sums were but a small part of\ntheir income, were merely pin money for their wives and children.\n\nYet--at heart and in all sincerity Kelly was an ardent Republican and\nHouse was a ferocious Democrat.  If you had asked either what\nRepublican and Democrat meant he would have been as vague and\nunsatisfactory in his reply as would have been any of his followers\nbearing torch and oilcloth cape in political processions, with no hope\nof gain--beyond the exquisite pleasure of making a shouting ass of\nhimself in the most public manner. But for all that, Kelly was a\nRepublican and House a Democrat. It is not a strange, though it is a\nprofoundly mysterious, phenomenon, that of the priest who arranges the\ntrick mechanism of the god, yet being a devout believer, ready to die\nfor his \"faith.\"\n\nDifficult though the task was of showing the average Remsen City man\nthat Republican and Democrat, Kelly and House, were one and the same\nthing, and that thing a blood-sucking, blood-heavy leech upon his\nveins--difficult though this task was, Victor Dorn knew that he had\nabout accomplished it, when David Hull appeared.  A new personality; a\nplausible personality, deceptive because self-deceiving--yet not so\nthoroughly self-deceived that it was in danger of hindering its own\nambition.  David Hull--just the kind of respectable, popular figurehead\nand cloak the desperate Kelly-House conspiracy needed.\n\nHow far had the \"army of education\" prepared the people for seeing\nthrough this clever new fraud upon them?  Victor Dorn could not judge.\nHe hoped for the best; he was prepared for the worst.\n\nThe better to think out the various problems of the new situation,\ncomplicated by his apparent debt of gratitude to Davy, Victor went\nforth into the woods very early the next morning.  He wandered far, but\nten o'clock found him walking in the path in the strip of woods near\nthe high road along the upper side of the park.  And when Jane Hastings\nappeared, he was standing looking in the direction from which she would\nhave to come.  It was significant of her state of mind that she had\ngiven small attention to her dress that morning.  Nor was she looking\nher best in expression or in color.  Her eyes and her skin suggested an\nalmost sleepless night.\n\nHe did not advance.  She came rapidly as if eager to get over that\nembarrassing space in which each could see the other, yet neither could\nspeak without raising the voice.  When she was near she said:\n\n\"You think you owe something to Davy Hull for what he did?\"\n\n\"The people think so,\" said he.  \"And that's the important thing.\"\n\n\"Well--you owe him nothing,\" pursued she.\n\n\"Nothing that would interfere with the cause,\" replied he. \"And that\nwould be true, no matter what he had done.\"\n\n\"I mean he did nothing for you,\" she explained.  \"I forgot to tell you\nyesterday.  The whole thing was simply a move to further his ambition.\nI happened to be there when he talked with father and enlisted him.\"\n\nVictor laughed.  \"It was your father who put it through.  I might have\nknown!\"\n\n\"At first I tried to interpose.  Then--I stopped.\"  She stood before\nhim with eyes down.  \"It came to me that for my own sake it would be\nbetter that you should lose this fall.  It seemed to me that if you won\nyou would be farther out of my reach.\"  She paused, went steadily on:\n\"It was a bad feeling I had that you must not get anything except with\nmy help.  Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said he cheerfully.  \"You are your father's own daughter.\"\n\n\"I love power,\" said she.  \"And so do you.  Only, being a woman, I'd\nstoop to things to get it, that a man--at least your sort of man--would\nscorn.  Do you despise me for that?  You oughtn't to.  And you will\nteach me better.  You can make of me what you please, as I told you\nyesterday.  I only half meant it then.  Now--it's true, through and\nthrough.\"\n\nVictor glanced round, saw near at hand the bench he was seeking. \"Let's\nsit down here,\" said he.  \"I'm rather tired.  I slept little and I've\nbeen walking all morning.  And you look tired, also.\"\n\n\"After yesterday afternoon I couldn't sleep,\" said she.\n\nWhen they were seated he looked at her with an expression that seemed\nto say:  \"I have thrown open the windows of my soul. Throw open yours;\nand let us look at each other as we are, and speak of things as they\nare.\"  She suddenly flung herself against his breast and as he clasped\nher she said:\n\n\"No--no!  Let's not reason coldly about things, Victor.  Let's\nfeel--let's LIVE!\"\n\nIt was several minutes--and not until they had kissed many\ntimes--before he regained enough self-control to say:  \"This simply\nwill not do, Jane.  How can we discuss things calmly?  You sit\nthere\"--he pushed her gently to one end of the bench--\"and I'll sit at\nthis end.  Now!\"\n\n\"I love you, Victor!  With your arms round me I am happy--and SO\nstrong!\"\n\n\"With my arms round you I'm happy, I'll admit,\" said he. \"But--oh, so\nweak!  I have the sense that I am doing wrong--that we are both doing\nwrong.\"\n\n\"Why?  Aren't you free?\"\n\n\"No, I am not free.  As I've told you, I belong to a cause--to a\ncareer.\"\n\n\"But I won't hinder you there.  I'll help you.\"\n\n\"Why go over that again?  You know better--I know better.\" Abruptly,\n\"Your father--what time does he get home for dinner?\"\n\n\"He didn't go down town to-day,\" replied Jane.  \"He's not well--not at\nall well.\"\n\nVictor looked baffled.  \"I was about to propose that we go straight to\nhim.\"\n\nIf he had been looking at Jane, he might have seen the fleeting flash\nof an expression that betrayed that she had suspected the object of his\ninquiry.\n\n\"You will not go with me to your father?\"\n\n\"Not when he is ill,\" said she.  \"If we told him, it might kill him.\nHe has ambitions--what he regards as ambitions--for me.  He admires\nyou, but--he doesn't admire your ideas.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Victor, following his own train of thought, \"we must fight\nthis out between ourselves.  I was hoping I'd have your father to help\nme.  I'm sure, as soon as you faced him with me, you'd realize that\nyour feeling about me is largely a delusion.\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Jane softly.  \"Your feeling about me--the feeling that\nmade you kiss me--was that delusion?\"\n\n\"It was--just what you saw,\" replied he, \"and nothing more. The idea of\nmarrying you--of living my life with you doesn't attract me in the\nleast.  I can't see you as my wife.\"  He looked at her impatiently.\n\"Have you no imagination?  Can't you see that you could not change, and\nbecome what you'd have to be if you lived with me?\"\n\n\"You can make of me what you please,\" repeated she with loving\nobstinacy.\n\n\"That is not sincere!\" cried he.  \"You may think it is, but it isn't.\nLook at me, Jane.\"\n\n\"I haven't been doing anything else since we met,\" laughed she.\n\n\"That's better,\" said he.  \"Let's not be solemn.  Solemnity is pose,\nand when people are posing they get nowhere.  You say I can make of you\nwhat I please.  Do you mean that you are willing to become a woman of\nmy class--to be that all your life--to bring up your children in that\nway--to give up your fashionable friends--and maid--and carriages--and\nParis clothes--to be a woman who would not make my associates and their\nfamilies uncomfortable and shy?\"\n\nShe was silent.  She tried to speak, but lifting her eyes before she\nbegan her glance encountered his and her words died upon her lips.\n\n\"You know you did not mean that,\" pursued he.  \"Now, I'll tell you what\nyou did mean.  You meant that after you and I were married--or\nengaged--perhaps you did not intend to go quite so far as marriage just\nyet.\"\n\nThe color crept into her averted face.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he commanded laughingly.\n\nWith an effort she forced her eyes to meet his.\n\n\"Now--smile, Jane!\"\n\nHis smile was contagious.  The curve of her lips changed; her eyes\ngleamed.\n\n\"Am I not reading your thoughts?\" said he.\n\n\"You are very clever, Victor,\" admitted she.\n\n\"Good.  We are getting on.  You believed that, once we were engaged, I\nwould gradually begin to yield, to come round to your way of thinking.\nYou had planned for me a career something like Davy Hull's--only freer\nand bolder.  I would become a member of your class, but would pose as a\nrepresentative of the class I had personally abandoned.  Am I right?\"\n\n\"Go on, Victor,\" she said.\n\n\"That's about all.  Now, there are just two objections to your plan.\nThe first is, it wouldn't work.  My associates would be 'on to' me in a\nvery short time.  They are shrewd, practical, practically educated\nmen--not at all the sort that follow Davy Hull or are wearing Kelly's\nand House's nose rings.  In a few months I'd find myself a leader\nwithout a following--and what is more futile and ridiculous than that?\"\n\n\"They worship you,\" said Jane.  \"They trust you implicitly. They know\nthat whatever you did would be for their good.\"\n\nHe laughed heartily.  \"How little you know my friends,\" said he.  \"I am\ntheir leader only because I am working with them, doing what we all see\nmust be done, doing it in the way in which we all see it must be done.\"\n\n\"But THAT is not power!\" cried Jane.\n\n\"No,\" replied Victor.  \"But it is the career I wish--the only one I'd\nhave.  Power means that one's followers are weak or misled or ignorant.\nTo be first among equals--that's worth while.  The other thing is the\npoor tawdriness that kings and bosses crave and that shallow, snobbish\npeople admire.\"\n\n\"I see that,\" said Jane.  \"At least, I begin to see it.  How wonderful\nyou are!\"\n\nVictor laughed.  \"Is it that I know so much, or is it that you know so\nlittle?\"\n\n\"You don't like for me to tell you that I admire you?\" said Jane,\nsubtle and ostentatiously timid.\n\n\"I don't care much about it one way or the other,\" replied Victor, who\nhad, when he chose, a rare ability to be blunt without being rude.\n\"Years ago, for my own safety, I began to train myself to care little\nfor any praise or blame but my own, and to make myself a very searching\ncritic of myself.  So, I am really flattered only when I win my own\npraise--and I don't often have that pleasure.\"\n\n\"Really, I don't see why you bother with me,\" said she with sly\ninnocence--which was as far as she dared let her resentments go.\n\n\"For two reasons,\" replied he promptly.  \"It flatters me that you are\ninterested in me.  The second reason is that, when I lost control of\nmyself yesterday, I involved myself in certain responsibilities to you.\nIt has seemed to me that I owe it to myself and to you to make you see\nthat there is neither present nor future in any relations between us.\"\n\nShe put out her hand, and before he knew what he was doing he had\nclasped it.  With a gentle, triumphant smile she said:  \"THERE'S the\nanswer to all your reasoning, Victor.\"\n\nHe released her hand.  \"AN answer,\" he said, \"but not the correct\nanswer.\"  He eyed her thoughtfully.  \"You have done me a great\nservice,\" he went on.  \"You have shown me an unsuspected, a dangerous\nweakness in myself.  At another time--and coming in another way, I\nmight have made a mess of my career--and of the things that have been\nentrusted to me.\"  A long pause, then he added, to himself rather than\nto her, \"I must look out for that.  I must do something about it.\"\n\nJane turned toward him and settled herself in a resolute attitude and\nwith a resolute expression.  \"Victor,\" she said, \"I've listened to you\nvery patiently.  Now I want you to listen to me. What is the truth\nabout us?  Why, that we are as if we had been made for each other.  I\ndon't know as much as you do.  I've led a much narrower life.  I've\nbeen absurdly mis-educated.  But as soon as I saw you I felt that I had\nfound the man I was looking for.  And I believe--I feel--I KNOW you\nwere drawn to me in the same way.  Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"You--fascinated me,\" confessed he.  \"You--or your clothes--or your\nperfume.\"\n\n\"Explain it as you like,\" said she.  \"The fact remains that we were\ndrawn together.  Well--Victor, _I_ am not afraid to face the future, as\nfate maps it out for us.  Are you?\"\n\nHe did not answer.\n\n\"You--AFRAID,\" she went on.  \"No--you couldn't be afraid.\"\n\nA long silence.  Then he said abruptly:  \"IF we loved each other.  But\nI know that we don't.  I know that you would hate me when you realized\nthat you couldn't move me.  And I know that I should soon get over the\ninfatuation for you.  As soon as it became a question of\nsympathies--common tastes--congeniality--I'd find you hopelessly\nlacking.\"\n\nShe felt that he was contrasting her with some one else--with a certain\nsome one.  And she veiled her eyes to hide their blazing jealousy.  A\nmovement on his part made her raise them in sudden alarm.  He had\nrisen.  His expression told her that the battle was lost--for the day.\nNever had she loved him as at that moment, and never had longing to\npossess him so dominated her willful, self-indulgent, spoiled nature.\nYet she hated him, too; she longed to crush him, to make him suffer--to\nrepay him with interest for the suffering he was inflicting upon\nher--the humiliation.  But she dared not show her feelings.  It would\nbe idle to try upon this man any of the coquetries indicated for such\ncases--to dismiss him coldly, or to make an appeal through an\nexhibition of weakness or reckless passion.\n\n\"You will see the truth, for yourself, as you think things over,\" said\nhe.\n\nShe rose, stood before him with downcast eyes, with mouth sad and\nsweet.  \"No,\" she said, \"It's you who are hiding the truth from\nyourself.  I hope--for both our sakes--that you'll see it before long.\nGood-by--dear.\"  She stretched out her hand.\n\nHesitatingly he took it.  As their hands met, her pulse beating against\nhis, she lifted her eyes.  And once more he was holding her close, was\nkissing her.  And she was lying in his arms unresisting, with two large\ntears shining in the long lashes of her closed eyes.\n\n\"Oh, Jane--forgive me!\" he cried, releasing her.  \"I must keep away\nfrom you.  I will--I WILL!\"  And he was rushing down the steep\nslope--direct, swift, relentless.  But she, looking after him with a\ntender, dreamy smile, murmured:  \"He loves me.  He will come again.  If\nnot--I'll go and get him!\"\n\n\nTo Jane Victor Dorn's analysis of his feeling toward her and of the\nreasons against yielding to it seemed of no importance whatever.  Side\nby side with Selma's \"One may not trifle with love\" she would have put\n\"In matters of love one does not reason,\" as equally axiomatic.  Victor\nwas simply talking; love would conquer him as it had conquered every\nman and every woman it had ever entered.  Love--blind, unreasoning,\nirresistible--would have its will and its way.\n\nAnd about most men she would have been right--about any man\npractically, of the preceding generation.  But Victor represented a new\ntype of human being--the type into whose life reason enters not merely\nas a theoretical force, to be consulted and disregarded, but as an\nauthority, a powerful influence, dominant in all crucial matters.  Only\nin our own time has science begun to make a notable impression upon the\nfog which formerly lay over the whole human mind, thicker here, thinner\nthere, a mere haze yonder, but present everywhere.  This fog made clear\nvision impossible, usually made seeing of any kind difficult; there was\nno such thing as finding a distinct line between truth and error as to\nany subject.  And reason seemed almost as faulty a guide as\nfeeling--was by many regarded as more faulty, not without justification.\n\nBut nowadays for some of us there are clear or almost clear horizons,\nand such fog banks as there are conceal from them nothing that is of\nimportance in shaping a rational course of life.  Victor Dorn was one\nof these emancipated few.  All successful men form their lives upon a\nsystem of some kind.  Even those who seem to live at haphazard, like\nthe multitude, prove to have chart and compass and definite port in\nobjective when their conduct is more attentively examined.  Victor\nDorn's system was as perfect as it was simple, and he held himself to\nit as rigidly as the father superior of a Trappist monastery holds his\nmonks to their routine.  Also, Victor had learned to know and to be on\nguard against those two arch-enemies of the man who wishes to \"get\nsomewhere\"--self-excuse and optimism.  He had got a good strong leash\nupon his vanity--and a muzzle, too.  When things went wrong he\ninstantly blamed HIMSELF, and did not rest until he had ferreted out\nthe stupidity or folly of which HE had been guilty.  He did not grieve\nover his failures; he held severely scientific post mortems upon them\nto discover the reason why--in order that there should not again be\nthat particular kind of failure at least.  Then, as to the other\narch-enemy, optimism, he simply cut himself off from indulgence in it.\nHe worked for success; he assumed failure.  He taught himself to care\nnothing about success, but only about doing as intelligently and as\nthoroughly as he could the thing next at hand.\n\nWhat has all this to do with his infatuation for Jane?  It serves to\nshow not only why the Workingmen's League was growing like a plague of\ngypsy moth, but also why Victor Dorn was not the man to be conquered by\npassion.  Naturally, Jane, who had only the vaguest conception of the\nsize and power of Victor Dorn's mind, could not comprehend wherein lay\nthe difference between him and the men she read about in novels or met\nin her wanderings among the people of her own class in various parts of\nthe earth.  It is possible for even the humblest of us to understand\ngenius, just as it is possible to view a mountain from all sides and\nget a clear idea of it bulk and its dominion.  But the hasty traveler\ncontents himself with a glance, a \"How superb,\" and a quick passing on;\nand most of us are hasty travelers in the scenic land of\nintellectuality.  Jane saw that he was a great man.  But she was\ndeceived by his frankness and his simplicity.  She evoked in him only\nthe emotional side of his nature, only one part of that.\n\nBecause it--the only phase of him she attentively examined--was so\nimpressive, she assumed that it was the chief feature of the man.\n\nAlso, young and inexperienced women--and women not so young, and with\nopportunity to become less inexperienced but without the ability to\nlearn by experience--always exaggerate the importance of passion.\nAlmost without exception, it is by way of passion that a man and a\nwoman approach each other.  It is, of necessity, the exterior that\nfirst comes into view.  Thus, all that youth and inexperience can know\nabout love is its aspect of passion. Because Jane had again and again\nin her five grown-up years experienced men falling passionately in love\nwith her, she fancied she was an expert in matters of love.  In fact,\nshe had still everything to learn.\n\nOn the way home she, assuming that the affair was as good as settled,\nthat she and Victor Dorn were lovers, was busy with plans for the\nfuture.  Victor Dorn had made a shrewd guess at the state of her mind.\nShe had no intention of allowing him to pursue his present career.\nThat was merely foundation.  With the aid of her love and council, and\nof her father's money and influence, he--he and she--would mount to\nsomething really worth while--something more than the petty politics of\na third rate city in the West.  Washington was the proper arena for his\ntalents; they would take the shortest route to Washington.  No trouble\nabout bringing him around; a man so able and so sensible as he would\nnot refuse the opportunity to do good on a grand scale.  Besides--he\nmust be got away from his family, from these doubtless good and kind\nbut certainly not very high class associates of his, and from Selma\nGordon.  The idea of his comparing HER with Selma Gordon!  He had not\ndone so aloud, but she knew what was in his mind.  Yes, he must be\ntaken far away from all these provincial and narrowing associations.\n\nBut all this was mere detail.  The big problem was how to bring her\nfather round.  He couldn't realize what Victor Dorn would be after she\nhad taken him in hand.  He would see only Victor Dorn, the labor\nagitator of Remsen City, the nuisance who put mischievous motives into\nthe heads of \"the hands\"--the man who made them think they had heads\nwhen they were intended by the Almighty to be simply hands.  How\nreconcile him to the idea of accepting this nuisance,  this poor,\ncommon member of the working class as a son-in-law, as the husband of\nthe daughter he wished to see married to some one of the \"best\"\nfamilies?\n\nOn the face of it, the thing was impossible.  Why, then, did not Jane\ndespair?  For two reasons.  In the first place, she was in love, and\nthat made her an optimist.  Somehow love would find the way.  But the\nsecond reason--the one she hid from herself deep in the darkest\nsub-cellar of her mind, was the real reason.  It is one matter to wish\nfor a person's death.  Only a villainous nature can harbor such a wish,\ncan admit it except as a hastily and slyly in-crawling impulse, to be\nflung out the instant it is discovered.  It is another matter to\ncalculate--very secretly, very unconsciously--upon a death that seems\ninevitable anyhow. Jane had only to look at her father to feel that he\nwould not be spared to her long.  The mystery was how he had kept alive\nso long, how he continued to live from day to day.  His stomach was\ngone; his whole digestive apparatus was in utter disorder.  His body\nhad shriveled until he weighed no more than a baby.  His pulse was so\nfeeble that even in the hot weather he complained of the cold and had\nto be wrapped in the heaviest winter garments. Yet he lived on, and his\nmind worked with undiminished vigor.\n\nWhen Jane reached home, the old man was sitting on the veranda in the\nfull sun.  On his huge head was a fur cap pulled well down over his\nears and intensifying  the mortuary, skull-like appearance of his face.\nOver his ulster was an old-fashioned Scotch shawl such as men used to\nwear in the days before overcoats came into fashion.  About his wasted\nlegs was wrapped a carriage robe, and she knew that there was a\nhot-water bag under his feet.  Beside him sat young Doctor Charlton,\nwhom Jane had at last succeeded in inducing her father to try.\nCharlton did not look or smell like a doctor.  He rather suggested a\nprofessional athlete, perhaps a better class prize fighter.  The\nweazened old financier was gazing at him with a fascinated\nexpression--admiring, envious, amused.\n\nCharlton was saying:\n\n\"Yes, you do look like a dead one.  But that's only another of your\ntricks for fooling people.  You'll live a dozen years unless you commit\nsuicide.  A dozen years?  Probably twenty.\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed to make sport of a poor old invalid,\" said\nHastings with a grin.\n\n\"Any man who could stand a lunch of crackers and milk for ten years\ncould outlive anything,\" retorted Charlton.  \"No, you belong to the old\nstock.  You used to see 'em around when you were a boy.  They usually\ncoughed and wheezed, and every time they did it, the family used to get\nready to send for the undertaker.  But they lived on and on.  When did\nyour mother die?\"\n\n\"Couple of years ago,\" said Hastings.\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"He was killed by a colt he was breaking at sixty-seven.\"\n\nCharlton laughed uproariously.  \"If you took walks and rides instead of\nalways sitting round, you never would die,\" said he. \"But you're like\nlots of women I know.  You'd rather die than take exercise.  Still,\nI've got you to stop that eating that was keeping you on the verge all\nthe time.\"\n\n\"You're trying to starve me to death,\" grumbled Hastings.\n\n\"Don't you feel better, now that you've got used to it and don't feel\nhungry?\"\n\n\"But I'm not getting any nourishment.\"\n\n\"How would eating help you?  You can't digest any more than what I'm\nallowing you.  Do you think you were better off when you were full of\nrotting food?  I guess not.\"\n\n\"Well--I'm doing as you say,\" said the old man resignedly.\n\n\"And if you keep it up for a year, I'll put you on a horse.  If you\ndon't keep it up, you'll find yourself in a hearse.\"\n\nJane stood silently by, listening with a feeling of depression which\nshe could not have accounted for, if she would--and would not if she\ncould.  Not that she wished her father to die; simply that Charlton's\nconfidence in his long life forced her to face the only\nalternative--bringing him round to accept Victor Dorn.\n\nAt her father's next remark she began to listen with a high beating\nheart.  He said to Charlton:\n\n\"How about that there friend of yours--that young Dorn?  You ain't\ntalked about him to-day as much as usual.\"\n\n\"The last time we talked about him we quarreled,\" said Charlton.  \"It's\nirritating to see a man of your intelligence a slave to silly\nprejudices.\"\n\n\"I like Victor Dorn,\" replied Hastings in a most conciliatory tone.  \"I\nthink he's a fine young man.  Didn't I have him up here at my house not\nlong ago?  Jane'll tell you that I like him. She likes him, too.  But\nthe trouble with him--and with you, too--is that you're dreaming all\nthe time.  You don't recognize facts.  And, so, you make a lot of\ntrouble for us conservative men.\"\n\n\"Please don't use that word conservative,\" said Charlton.  \"It gags me\nto hear it.  YOU'RE not a conservative.  If you had been you'd still be\na farm hand.  You've been a radical all your life--changing things\nround and round, always according to your idea of what was to your\nadvantage.  The only difference between radicals like you robber\nfinanciers and radicals like Victor and me is that our ideas of what's\nto our advantage differ.  To you life means money; to us it means\nhealth and comfort and happiness.  You want the world changed--laws\nupset, liberty destroyed, wages lowered, and so on--so that you can get\nall the money.  We want the world changed so that we can be healthy and\ncomfortable and happy--securely so--which we can't be unless everybody\nis, or is in the way to being.\"\n\nJane was surprised to see that her father, instead of being offended,\nwas amused and pleased.  He liked his new doctor so well that he liked\neverything he said and did.  Jane looked at Charlton in her friendliest\nway.  Here might be an ally, and a valuable ally.\n\n\"Human nature doesn't change,\" said Hastings in the tone of a man who\nis stating that which cannot be disputed.\n\n\"The mischief it doesn't,\" said Charlton in prompt and vigorous\ndissent.  \"When conditions change, human nature has to change, has to\nadapt itself.  What you mean is that human nature doesn't change\nitself.  But conditions change it.  They've been changing it very\nrapidly these last few years.  Science--steam, electricity, a thousand\ninventions and discoveries, crowding one upon another--science has\nbrought about entirely new and unprecedented conditions so rapidly that\nthe changes in human nature now making and that must be made in the\nnext few years are resulting in a series of convulsions.  You\nold-fashioned fellows--and the political parties and the\npoliticians--are in danger of being stranded.  Leaders like Victor\nDorn--movements like our Workingmen's League--they seem new and radical\nto-day. By to-morrow they'll be the commonplace thing, found\neverywhere--and administering the public affairs.\"\n\nJane was not surprised to see an expression of at least partial\nadmission upon her father's face.  Charlton's words were of the kind\nthat set the imagination to work, that remind those who hear of a\nthousand and one familiar related facts bearing upon the same points.\n\"Well,\" said Hastings, \"I don't expect to see any radical changes in my\ntime.\"\n\n\"Then you'll not live as long as I think,\" said Charlton.  \"We\nAmericans advance very slowly because this is a big country and\nundeveloped, and because we shift about so much that no one stays in\none place long enough to build up a citizenship and get an education in\npolitics--which is nothing more or less than an education in the art of\nliving.  But slow though we are, we do advance.  You'll soon see the\nlast of Boss Kelly and Boss House--and of such gentle, amiable frauds\nas our friend Davy Hull.\"\n\nJane laughed merrily.  \"Why do you call him a fraud?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because he is a fraud,\" said Charlton.  \"He is trying to confuse the\nissue.  He says the whole trouble is petty dishonesty in public life.\nBosh!  The trouble is that the upper and middle classes are milking the\nlower class--both with and without the aid of the various governments,\nlocal, state and national. THAT'S the issue.  And the reason it is\nbeing forced is because the lower class, the working class, is slowly\nawakening to the truth.  When it completely awakens----\" Charlton made\na large gesture and laughed.\n\n\"What then?\" said Hastings.\n\n\"The end of the upper and the middle classes.  Everybody will have to\nwork for a living.\"\n\n\"Who's going to be elected this fall?\" asked Jane.  \"Your man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Doctor Charlton.  \"Victor Dorn thinks not.  But he always\ntakes the gloomy view.  And he doesn't meet and talk with the fellows\non the other side, as I do.\"\n\nHastings was looking out from under the vizor of his cap with a\npeculiar grin.  It changed to a look of startled inquiry as Charlton\nwent on to say:\n\n\"Yes, we'll win.  But the Davy Hull gang will get the offices.\"\n\n\"Why do you think that?\" asked old Hastings sharply.\n\nCharlton eyed his patient with a mocking smile.  \"You didn't think any\none knew but you and Kelly--did you?\" laughed he.\n\n\"Knew what?\" demanded Hastings, with a blank stare.\n\n\"No matter,\" said Charlton.  \"I know what you intend to do. Well,\nyou'll get away with the goods.  But you'll wish you hadn't.  You\nold-fashioned fellows, as I've been telling you, don't realize that\ntimes have changed.\"\n\n\"Do you mean, Doctor, that the election is to be stolen away from you?\"\ninquired Jane.\n\n\"Was that what I meant, Mr. Hastings?\" said Charlton.\n\n\"The side that loses always shouts thief at the side that wins,\" said\nthe old man indifferently.  \"I don't take any interest in politics.\"\n\n\"Why should you?\" said the Doctor audaciously.  \"You own both sides.\nSo, it's heads you win, tails I lose.\"\n\nHastings laughed heartily.  \"Them political fellows are a lot of\nblackmailers,\" said he.\n\n\"That's ungrateful,\" said Charlton.  \"Still, I don't blame you for\nliking the Davy Hull crowd better.  From them you can get what you want\njust the same, only you don't have to pay for it.\"\n\nHe rose and stretched his big frame, with a disregard of conventional\ngood manners so unconscious that it was inoffensive.\n\nBut Charlton had a code of manners of his own, and somehow it seemed to\nsuit him where the conventional code would have made him seem cheap.\n\"I didn't mean to look after your political welfare, too,\" said he.\n\"But I'll make no charge for that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I like to hear you young fellows talk,\" said Martin. \"You'll sing\na different song when you're as old as I am and have found out what a\nlot of damn fools the human race is.\"\n\n\"As I told you before,\" said Charlton, \"it's conditions that make the\nhuman animal whatever it is.  It's in the harness of conditions--the\ntreadmill of conditions--the straight jacket of conditions.  Change the\nconditions and you change the animal.\"\n\nWhen he was swinging his big powerful form across the lawns toward the\nfringe of woods, Jane and her father looking after him, Jane said:\n\n\"He's wonderfully clever, isn't he?\"\n\n\"A dreamer--a crank,\" replied the old man.\n\n\"But what he says sounds reasonable,\" suggested the daughter.\n\n\"It SOUNDS sensible,\" admitted the old man peevishly.  \"But it ain't\nwhat _I_ was brought up to call sensible.  Don't you get none of those\nfool ideas into your head.  They're all very well for men that haven't\ngot any property or any responsibilities--for flighty fellows like\nCharlton and that there Victor Dorn.  But as soon as anybody gets\nproperty and has interests to look after, he drops that kind of talk.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that property makes a man too blind or too cowardly to\nspeak the truth?\" asked Jane with an air of great innocence.\n\nThe old man either did not hear or had no answer ready.  He said:\n\n\"You heard him say that Davy Hull was going to win?\"\n\n\"Why, he said Victor Dorn was going to win,\" said Jane, still simple\nand guileless.\n\nHastings frowned impatiently.  \"That was just loose talk.  He admitted\nDavy was to be the next mayor.  If he is--and I expect Charlton was\nabout right--if Davy is elected, I shouldn't be surprised to see him\nnominated for governor next year.  He's a sensible, knowing fellow.\nHe'll make a good mayor, and he'll be elected governor on his record.\"\n\n\"And on what you and the other men who run things will do for him,\"\nsuggested Jane slyly.\n\nHer father grinned expressively.  \"I like to see a sensible, ambitious\nyoung fellow from my town get on,\" said he.  \"And I'd like to see my\ngirl married to a fellow of that sort, and settled.\"\n\n\"I think more could be done with a man like Victor Dorn,\" said Jane.\n\"It seems to me the Davy Hull sort of politics is--is about played out.\nDon't you think so?\"\n\nJane felt that her remark was a piece of wild audacity.  But she was\ndesperate.  To her amazement her father did not flare up but kept\nsilent, wearing the look she knew meant profound reflection.\n\nAfter a moment he said:\n\n\"Davy's a knowing boy.  He showed that the other day when he jumped in\nand made himself a popular hero.  He'd never 'a' been able to come\nanywheres near election but for that.  Dorn'd 'a' won by a vote so big\nthat Dick Kelly wouldn't 'a' dared even try to count him out....\nDorn's a better man than Davy.  But Dorn's got a foolish streak in him.\nHe believes the foolishness he talks, instead of simply talking it to\ngain his end.  I've been looking him over and thinking him over.  He\nwon't do, Jinny.\"\n\nWas her father discussing the matter abstractly, impersonally, as he\nseemed?  Or, had he with that uncanny shrewdness of his somehow\npenetrated to her secret--or to a suspicion of it?  Jane was so\nagitated that she sat silent and rigid, trying to look unconcerned.\n\n\"I had a strong notion to try to do something for him,\" continued the\nold man.  \"But it'd be no use.  He'd not rise to a chance that was\noffered him.  He's set on going his own way.\"\n\nJane trembled--dared.  \"I believe _I_ could do something with him,\"\nsaid she--and she was pleased with the coolness of her voice, the\ncomplete absence of agitation or of false note.\n\n\"Try if you like,\" said her father.  \"But I'm sure you'll find I'm\nright.  Be careful not to commit yourself in any way.  But I needn't\nwarn you.  You know how to take care of yourself.  Still, maybe you\ndon't realize how set up he'd be over being noticed by a girl in your\nposition.  And if you gave him the notion that there was a chance for\nhim to marry you, he'd be after you hammer and tongs.  The idea of\ngetting hold of so much money'd set him crazy.\"\n\n\"I doubt if he cares very much--or at all--about money,\" said Jane,\njudicially.\n\nHastings grinned satirically.  \"There ain't nobody that don't care\nabout money,\" said he, \"any more than there's anybody that don't care\nabout air to breathe.  Put a pin right there, Jinny.\"\n\n\"I hate to think that,\" she said, reluctantly, \"but I'm\nafraid--it's--so.\"\n\n\nAs she was taking her ride one morning she met David Hull also on\nhorseback and out for his health.  He turned and they rode together,\nfor several miles, neither breaking the silence except with an\noccasional remark about weather or scenery.  Finally Davy said:\n\n\"You seem to be down about something, too?\"\n\n\"Not exactly down,\" replied Jane.  \"Simply--I've been doing a lot of\nthinking--and planning--or attempt at planning--lately.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Davy.\n\n\"Naturally.  How's politics?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't hear anything but that I'm going to be elected.  If\nyou want to become convinced that the whole world is on the graft, take\npart in a reform campaign.  We've attracted every broken-down political\ncrook in this region.  It's hard to say which crowd is the more\nworthless, the college amateurs at politics or these rotten old\nin-goods who can't get employment with either Kelly or House and, so,\nhave joined us.  By Jove, I'd rather be in with the out and out\ngrafters--the regulars that make no bones of being in politics for the\nspoils.  There's slimy hypocrisy over our crowd that revolts me.  Not a\nparticle of sincerity or conviction.  Nothing but high moral guff.\"\n\n\"Oh, but YOU'RE sincere, Davy,\" said Jane with twinkling eyes.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Davy angrily.  \"I'm not so damn sure of it.\" Hastily, \"I\ndon't mean that.  Of course, I'm sincere--as sincere as a man can be\nand get anywhere in this world.  You've got to humbug the people,\nbecause they haven't sense enough to want the truth.\"\n\n\"I guess, Davy,\" said Jane shrewdly, \"if you told them the whole truth\nabout yourself and your party they'd have sense enough--to vote for\nVictor Dorn.\"\n\n\"He's a demagogue,\" said Davy with an angry jerk at his rein. \"He knows\nthe people aren't fit to rule.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" said Jane.  \"I've yet to see any human creature who could run\nanything without making more or less of a mess of it. And--well,\npersonally, I'd prefer incompetent honest servants to competent ones\nwho were liars or thieves.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think,\" said Davy, \"that the only thing to do is to burn\nthe world up and start another one.\"\n\n\"You don't talk like a man who expected to be elected,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Oh--I'm worrying about myself--not about the election,\" said Hull,\nlapsing into sullen silence.  And certainly he had no reason to worry\nabout the election.  He had the Citizen's Alliance and the Democratic\nnominations.  And, as a further aid to him, Dick Kelly had given the\nRepublican nomination to Alfred Sawyer, about the most unpopular\nmanufacturer in that region. Sawyer, a shrewd money maker, was an ass\nin other ways, was strongly seized of the itch for public office.\nKelly, seeking the man who would be the weakest, combined business with\ngood politics; he forced Sawyer to pay fifty thousand dollars into the\n\"campaign fund\" in a lump sum, and was counting confidently upon\n\"milking\" him for another fifty thousand in installments during the\ncampaign.  Thus, in the natural order of things, Davy could safely\nassume that he would be the next mayor of Remsen City by a gratifyingly\nlarge majority.  The last vote of the Workingmen's League had been made\nfifteen hundred.  Though it should quadruple its strength at the coming\nelection--which was most improbable--it would still be a badly beaten\nsecond. Politically, Davy was at ease.\n\nJane waited ten minutes, then asked abruptly:\n\n\"What's become of Selma Gordon?\"\n\n\"Did you see this week's New Day?\"\n\n\"Is it out?  I've seen no one, and haven't been down town.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of stuff in it against me.  Most of it demagoguing, of\ncourse, but more or less hysterical campaigning. The only nasty article\nabout me--a downright personal attack on my sincerity--was signed\n'S.G.'\"\n\n\"Oh--to be sure,\" said Jane, with smiling insincerity.  \"I had almost\nforgotten what you told me.  Well, it's easy enough to bribe her to\nsilence.  Go offer yourself to her.\"\n\nA long silence, then Davy said:  \"I don't believe she'd accept me.\"\n\n\"Try it,\" said Jane.\n\nAgain a long pause.  David said sullenly:  \"I did.\"\n\nSelma Gordon had refused David Hull!  Half a dozen explanations of this\nastounding occurrence rapidly suggested themselves.  Jane rejected each\nin turn at a glance.  \"You're sure she understood you?\"\n\n\"I made myself as clear as I did when I proposed to you,\" replied Davy\nwith a lack of tact which a woman of Jane's kind would never forget or\nforgive.\n\nJane winced, ignored.  Said she:  \"You must have insisted on some\nconditions she hesitated to accept.\"\n\n\"On her own terms,\" said Davy.\n\nJane gave up trying to get the real reason from him, sought it in\nSelma's own words and actions.  She inquired:  \"What did she say?  What\nreason did she give?\"\n\n\"That she owed it to the cause of her class not to marry a man of my\nclass,\" answered Hull, believing that he was giving the exact and the\nonly reason she assigned or had.\n\nJane gave a faint smile of disdain.  \"Women don't act from a sense of\nduty,\" she said.\n\n\"She's not the ordinary woman,\" said Hull.  \"You must remember she\nwasn't brought up as you and I were--hasn't our ideas of life.  The\nthings that appeal to us most strongly don't touch her.  She knows\nnothing about them.\"  He added, \"And that's her great charm for me.\"\n\nJane nodded sympathetically.  Her own case exactly.  After a brief\nhesitation she suggested:\n\n\"Perhaps Selma's in love with--some one else.\"  The pause before the\nvague \"some one else\" was almost unnoticeable.\n\n\"With Victor Dorn, you mean?\" said Davy.  \"I asked her about that.  No,\nshe's not in love with him.\"\n\n\"As if she'd tell you!\"\n\nDavy looked at her a little scornfully.  \"Don't insinuate,\" he said.\n\"You know she would.  There's nothing of the ordinary tricky, evasive,\nfaking woman about her.  And although she's got plenty of excuse for\nbeing conceited, she isn't a bit so.  She isn't always thinking about\nherself, like the girls of our class.\"\n\n\"I don't in the least wonder at your being in love with her, Davy,\"\nsaid Jane sweetly.  \"Didn't I tell you I admired your taste--and your\ncourage?\"\n\n\"You're sneering at me,\" said Davy.  \"All the same, it did take\ncourage--for I'm a snob at bottom--like you--like all of us who've been\nbrought up so foolishly--so rottenly.  But I'm proud that I had the\ncourage.  I've had a better opinion of myself ever since.  And if you\nhave any unspoiled womanhood in you, you agree with me.\"\n\n\"I do agree with you,\" said Jane softly.  She reached out and laid her\nhand on his arm for an instant.  \"That's honest, Davy.\"\n\nHe gave her a grateful look.  \"I know it,\" said he.  \"The reason I\nconfide things to you is because I know you're a real woman at bottom,\nJane--the only real person I've ever happened across in our class.\"\n\n\"It took more courage for you to do that sort of thing than it would\nfor a woman,\" said Jane.  \"It's more natural, easier for a woman to\nstake everything in love.  If she hasn't the man she wants she hasn't\nanything, while a man's wife can be a mere detail in his life.  He can\nforget he's married, most of the time.\"\n\n\"That isn't the way I intend to be married,\" said Davy.  \"I want a wife\nwho'll be half, full half, of the whole.  And I'll get her.\"\n\n\"You mean you haven't given up?\"\n\n\"Why should I?  She doesn't love another man.  So, there's hope. Don't\nyou think so?\"\n\nJane was silent.  She hastily debated whether it would be wiser to say\nyes or to say no.\n\n\"Don't you think so?\" repeated he.\n\n\"How can I tell?\" replied Jane, diplomatically.  \"I'd have to see her\nwith you--see how she feels toward you.\"\n\n\"I think she likes me,\" said Davy, \"likes me a good deal.\"\n\nJane kept her smile from the surface.  What a man always thought, no\nmatter how plainly a woman showed that she detested him.  \"No doubt she\ndoes,\" said Jane.  She had decided upon a course of action.  \"If I were\nyou, Davy, I'd keep away from her for the present--give her time to\nthink it over, to see all the advantages.  If a man forces himself on a\nqueer, wild sort of girl such as Selma is, he's likely to drive her\nfurther away.\"\n\nDavy reflected.  \"Guess you're right,\" said he finally.  \"My instinct\nis always to act--to keep on acting until I get results. But it's\ndangerous to do that with Selma.  At least, I think so. I don't know.\nI don't understand her.  I've got nothing to offer her--nothing that\nshe wants--as she frankly told me.  Even if she loved me, I doubt if\nshe'd marry me--on account of her sense of duty.  What you said awhile\nago--about women never doing things from a sense of duty--that shows\nhow hard it is for a woman to understand what's perfectly simple to a\nman.  Selma isn't the sheltered woman sort--the sort whose moral\nobligations are all looked after by the men of her family.  The\nold-fashioned woman always belonged to some man--or else was an\noutcast.  This new style of woman looks at life as a man does.\"\n\nJane listened with a somewhat cynical expression. No doubt, in theory,\nthere was a new style of woman. But practically, the new style of woman\nmerely TALKED differently; at least, she was still the old-fashioned\nwoman, longing for dependence upon some man and indifferent to the\nobligations men made such a fuss about--probably not so sincerely as\nthey fancied.  But her expression changed when Davy went on to say:\n\n\"She'd look at a thing of that sort much as I--or Victor Dorn would.\"\n\nJane's heart suddenly sank.  Because the unconscious blow had hurt she\nstruck out, struck back with the first weapon she could lay hold of.\n\"But you said a minute ago that Victor was a hypocritical demagogue.\"\n\nDavy flushed with confusion.  He was in a franker mood now, however.\n\"I'd like to think that,\" he replied.  \"But I don't honestly believe\nit.\"\n\n\"You think that if Victor Dorn loved a woman of our class he'd put her\nout of his life?\"\n\n\"That's hardly worth discussing,\" said Davy.  \"No woman of our\nclass--no woman he'd be likely to look at--would encourage him to the\npoint where he'd presume upon it.\"\n\n\"How narrow you are!\" cried Jane, derisive but even more angry.\n\n\"It's different--entirely different--with a man, even in our class.\nBut a woman of our class--she's a lady or she's nothing at all.  And a\nlady couldn't be so lacking in refinement as to descend to a man\nsocially beneath her.\"\n\n\"I can see how ANY woman might fall in love with Victor Dorn.\"\n\n\"You're just saying that to be argumentative,\" said Davy with\nconviction.  \"Take yourself, for example.\"\n\n\"I confess I don't see any such contrast between Victor and you--except\nwhere the comparison's altogether in his favor,\" said Jane pleasantly.\n\"You don't know as much as he does.  You haven't the independence of\ncharacter--or the courage--or the sincerity.  You couldn't be a real\nleader, as he is.  You have to depend on influence, and on trickery.\"\n\nA covert glance at the tall, solemn-looking young man riding silently\nbeside her convinced her that he was as uncomfortable as she had hoped\nto make him.\n\n\"As for manners--and the things that go to make a gentleman,\" she went\non, \"I'm not sure but that there, too, the comparison is against you.\nYou always suggest to me that if you hadn't the pattern set for men of\nour class and didn't follow it, you'd be absolutely lost, Davy, dear.\nWhile Victor--he's a fine, natural person, with the manners that grow\nas naturally out of his personality as oak leaves grow out of an oak.\"\n\nJane was astonished and delighted by this eloquence of hers about the\nman she loved--an eloquence far above her usual rather commonplace mode\nof speech and thought.  Love was indeed an inspirer!  What a person she\nwould become when she had Victor always stimulating her.  She went on:\n\n\"A woman would never grow tired of Victor.  He doesn't talk stale stuff\nsuch as all of us get from the stale little professors and stale,\ndreary text-books at our colleges.\"\n\n\"Why don't you fall in love with him?\" said Davy sourly.\n\n\"I do believe you're envious of Victor Dorn,\" retorted Jane.\n\n\"What a disagreeable mood you're in to-day,\" said Davy.\n\n\"So a man always thinks when a woman speaks well of another man in his\npresence.\"\n\n\"I didn't suspect you of being envious of Selma.  Why should you\nsuspect me of feeling ungenerously about Victor?  Fall in love with him\nif you like.  Heaven knows, I'd do nothing to stop it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall,\" said Jane, with unruffled amiability. \"You're\nsetting a dangerous example of breaking down class lines.\"\n\n\"Now, Jane, you know perfectly well that while, if I married Selma\nshe'd belong to my class, a woman of our class marrying Victor Dorn\nwould sink to his class.  Why quarrel about anything so obviously true?\"\n\n\"Victor Dorn belongs to a class by himself,\" replied Jane. \"You forget\nthat men of genius are not regarded like you poor ordinary mortals.\"\n\nDavy was relieved that they had reached the turning at which they had\nto separate.  \"I believe you are in love with him,\" said he as a\nparting shot.\n\nJane, riding into her lane, laughed gayly, mockingly.  She arrived at\nhome in fine humor.  It pleased her that Davy, for all his love for\nSelma, could yet be jealous of Victor Dorn on her account.  And more\nthan ever, after this talk with him--the part of it that preceded the\nquarrel--she felt that she was doing a fine, brave, haughtily\naristocratic thing in loving Victor Dorn. Only a woman with a royal\nsoul would venture to be thus audacious.\n\nShould she encourage or discourage the affair between Davy and Selma?\nThere was much to be said for this way of removing Selma from her path;\nalso, if a man of Davy Hull's position married beneath him, less would\nbe thought of her doing the same thing. On the other hand, she felt\nthat she had a certain property right in David Hull, and that Selma was\ntaking what belonged to her. This, she admitted to herself, was mean\nand small, was unworthy of the woman who was trying to be worthy of\nVictor Dorn, of such love as she professed for him.  Yes, mean and\nsmall.  She must try to conquer it.\n\nBut--when she met Selma in the woods a few mornings later, her dominant\nemotions were anything but high-minded and generous. Selma was looking\nher most fascinating--wild and strange and unique.  They caught sight\nof each other at the same instant. Jane came composedly on--Selma made\na darting movement toward a by-path opening near her, hesitated, stood\nlike some shy, lovely bird of the deep wilderness ready to fly away\ninto hiding.\n\n\"Hello, Selma!\" said Jane carelessly.\n\nSelma looked at her with wide, serious eyes.\n\n\"Where have you been keeping yourself of late?  Busy with the writing,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"I owe you an apology,\" said Selma, in a queer, suppressed voice.  \"I\nhave been hating you, and trying to think of some way to keep you and\nVictor Dorn apart.  I thought it was from my duty to the cause.  I've\nfound out that it was a low, mean personal reason.\"\n\nJane had stopped short, was regarding her with eyes that glowed in a\npallid face.  \"Because you are in love with him?\" she said.\n\nSelma gave a quick, shamed nod.  \"Yes,\" she said--the sound was\nscarcely audible.\n\nSelma's frank and generous--and confiding--self-sacrifice aroused no\nresponse in Jane Hastings.  For the first time in her life she was\nknowing what it meant to hate.\n\n\"And I've got to warn you,\" Selma went on, \"that I am going to do\nwhatever I can to keep you from hindering him.  Not because I love him,\nbut because I owe it to the cause.  He belongs to it, and I must help\nhim be single-hearted for it.  You could only be a bad influence in his\nlife.  I think you would like to be a sincere woman; but you can't.\nYour class is too strong for you. So--it would be wrong for Victor Dorn\nto love and to marry you. I think he realizes it and is struggling to\nbe true to himself. I intend to help him, if I can.\"\n\nJane smiled cruelly.  \"What hypocrisy!\" she said, and turned and walked\naway.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIn America we have been bringing up our women like men, and treating\nthem like children.  They have active minds with nothing to act upon.\nThus they are driven to think chiefly about themselves.  With Jane\nHastings, self-centering took the form of self-analysis most of the\ntime.  She was intensely interested in what she regarded as the new\ndevelopment of her character.  This definite and apparently final\ndecision for the narrow and the ungenerous.  In fact, it was no new\ndevelopment, but simply a revelation to herself of her own real\ncharacter.  She was seeing at last the genuine Jane Hastings,\ninevitable product of a certain heredity in a certain environment.  The\nhigh thinking and talking, the idealistic aspiration were pose and\npretense.  Jane Hastings was a selfish, self-absorbed person, ready to\ndo almost any base thing to gain her ends, ready to hate to the\nuttermost any one who stood between her and her object.\n\n\"I'm certainly not a lovely person--not a lovable person,\" thought she,\nwith that gentle tolerance wherewith we regard our ownselves, whether\nin the dress of pretense or in the undress of deformed humanness.\n\"Still--I am what I am, and I've got to make the best of it.\"\n\nAs she thought of Selma's declaration of war she became less and less\ndisturbed about it.  Selma neither would nor could do anything sly.\nWhatever she attempted in the open would only turn Victor Dorn more\nstrongly toward herself.  However, she must continue to try to see him,\nmust go to see him in a few days if she did not happen upon him in her\nrides or walks.  How poorly he would think of her if he knew the truth\nabout her!  But then, how poor most women--and men, too--would look in\na strong and just light.  Few indeed could stand idealizing; except\nVictor, no one she knew.  And he was human enough not to make her\nuncomfortable in his presence.\n\nBut it so happened that before she could see Victor Dorn her father\ndisobeyed Dr. Charlton and gave way to the appetite that was the chief\ncause of his physical woes.  He felt so well that he ate the family\ndinner, including a peach cobbler with whipped cream, which even the\nrobust Jane adventured warily.  Martha was dining with them.  She\nabetted her father.  \"It's light,\" said she.  \"It couldn't harm\nanybody.\"\n\n\"You mustn't touch it, popsy,\" said Jane.\n\nShe unthinkingly spoke a little too commandingly.  Her father, in a\nperverse and reckless mood, took Martha's advice.  An hour later Dr.\nCharlton was summoned, and had he not arrived promptly----\n\n\"Another fifteen or twenty minutes,\" said he to the old man when he had\nhim out of immediate danger, \"and I'd have had nothing to do but sign a\ncertificate of natural death.\"\n\n\"Murder would have been nearer the truth,\" said Martin feebly. \"That\nthere fool Martha!\"\n\n\"Come out from behind that petticoat!\" cried Charlton. \"Didn't I spend\nthe best part of three days in giving you the correct ideas as to\nhealth and disease--in showing you that ALL disease comes from\nindigestion--ALL disease, from falling hair and sore eyes to weak\nankles and corns?  And didn't I convince you that you could eat only\nthe things I told you about?\"\n\n\"Don't hit a man when he's down,\" groaned Hastings.\n\n\"If I don't, you'll do the same idiotic trick again when I get you\nup--if I get you up.\"\n\nHastings looked quickly at him.  This was the first time Charlton had\never expressed a doubt about his living.  \"Do you mean that?\" he said\nhoarsely.  \"Or are you just trying to scare me?\"\n\n\"Both,\" said Charlton.  \"I'll do my best, but I can't promise. I've\nlost confidence in you.  No wonder doctors, after they've been in\npractice a few years, stop talking food and digestion to their\npatients.  I've never been able to convince a single human being that\nappetite is not the sign of health, and yielding to it the way to\nhealth.  But I've made lots of people angry and have lost their trade.\nI had hopes of you.  You were such a hopeless wreck.  But no.  And you\ncall yourself an intelligent man!\"\n\n\"I'll never do it again,\" said Hastings, pleading, but smiling,\ntoo--Charlton's way of talking delighted him.\n\n\"You think this is a joke,\" said Charlton, shaking his bullet head.\n\"Have you any affairs to settle?  If you have, send for your lawyer in\nthe morning.\"\n\nFear--the Great Fear--suddenly laid its icy long fingers upon the\nthroat of the old man.  He gasped and his eyes rolled.  \"Don't trifle\nwith me, Charlton,\" he muttered.  \"You know you will pull me through.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" said Charlton.  \"I promise nothing.  I'm serious\nabout the lawyer.\"\n\n\"I don't want no lawyer hanging round my bed,\" growled the old man.\n\"It'd kill me.  I've got nothing to settle.  I don't run things with\nloose ends.  And there's Jinny and Marthy and the boy--share and share\nalike.\"\n\n\"Well--you're in no immediate danger.  I'll come early to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Wait till I get to sleep.\"\n\n\"You'll be asleep as soon as the light's down.  But I'll stop a few\nminutes and talk to your daughter.\"\n\nCharlton found Jane at the window in the dressing room next her\nfather's bedroom.  He said loudly enough for the old man to overhear:\n\n\"Your father's all right for the present, so you needn't worry. Come\ndownstairs with me.  He's to go to sleep now.\"\n\nJane went in and kissed the bulging bony forehead.  \"Good night, popsy.\"\n\n\"Good night, Jinny dear,\" he said in a softer voice than she had ever\nheard from him.  \"I'm feeling very comfortable now, and sleepy.  If\nanything should happen, don't forget what I said about not temptin'\nyour brother by trustin' him too fur.  Look after your own affairs.\nTake Mr. Haswell's advice.  He's stupid, but he's honest and careful\nand safe.  You might talk to Dr. Charlton about things, too.  He's\nstraight, and knows what's what.  He's one of them people that gives\neverybody good advice but themselves.  If anything should happen----\"\n\n\"But nothing's going to happen, popsy.\"\n\n\"It might.  I don't seem to care as much as I did.  I'm so tarnation\ntired.  I reckon the goin' ain't as bad as I always calculated.  I\ndidn't know how tired they felt and anxious to rest.\"\n\n\"I'll turn down the light.  The nurse is right in there.\"\n\n\"Yes--turn the light.  If anything should happen, there's an envelope\nin the top drawer in my desk for Dr. Charlton.  But don't tell him till\nI'm gone.  I don't trust nobody, and if he knowed there was something\nwaiting, why, there's no telling----\"\n\nThe old man had drowsed off.  Jane lowered the light and went down to\njoin Charlton on the front veranda, where he was smoking a cigarette.\nShe said:\n\n\"He's asleep.\"\n\n\"He's all right for the next few days,\" said Charlton.  \"After that--I\ndon't know.  I'm very doubtful.\"\n\nJane was depressed, but not so depressed as she would have been had not\nher father so long looked like death and so often been near dying.\n\n\"Stay at home until I see how this is going to turn out. Telephone your\nsister to be within easy call.  But don't let her come here.  She's not\nfit to be about an ill person.  The sight of her pulling a long, sad\nface might carry him off in a fit of rage.\"\n\nJane observed him with curiosity in the light streaming from the front\nhall.  \"You're a very practical person aren't you?\" she said.\n\n\"No romance, no idealism, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe laughed in his plain, healthy way.  \"Not a frill,\" said he. \"I'm\ninterested only in facts.  They keep me busy enough.\"\n\n\"You're not married, are you?\"\n\n\"Not yet.  But I shall be as soon as I find a woman I want.\"\n\n\"IF you can get her.\"\n\n\"I'll get her, all right,\" replied he.  \"No trouble about that.  The\nwoman I want'll want me.\"\n\n\"I'm eager to see her,\" said Jane.  \"She'll be a queer one.\"\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" said he.  \"But I'll make her a queer one before I\nget through with her--queer, in my sense, meaning sensible and useful.\"\n\n\"You remind me so often of Victor Dorn, yet you're not at all like him.\"\n\n\"We're in the same business--trying to make the human race fit to\nassociate with.  He looks after the minds; I look after the bodies.\nMine's the humbler branch of the business, perhaps--but it's equally\nnecessary, and it comes first.  The chief thing that's wrong with human\nnature is bad health.  I'm getting the world ready for Victor.\"\n\n\"You like him?\"\n\n\"I worship him,\" said Charlton in his most matter-of-fact way.\n\n\"Yet he's just the opposite of you.  He's an idealist.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" laughed Charlton.  \"He's the most practical,\nsensible man in this town.  You people think he's a crank because he\nisn't crazy about money or about stepping round on the necks of his\nfellow beings.  The truth is, he's got a sense of proportion--and a\nsense of humor--and an idea of a rational happy life.  You're still\nbarbarians, while he's a civilized man.  Ever seen an ignorant yap jeer\nwhen a neat, clean, well-dressed person passed by?  Well, you people\njeering at Victor Dorn are like that yap.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said Jane hastily and earnestly.\n\n\"No, you don't,\" replied Charlton, tossing away the end of his\ncigarette.  \"And so much the worse for you.  Good-night, lady.\"\n\nAnd away he strode into the darkness, leaving her amused, yet with a\npeculiar sense of her own insignificance.\n\nCharlton was back again early the next morning and spent that day--and\na large part of many days there-after--in working at the wreck, Martin\nHastings, inspecting known weak spots, searching for unknown ones,\npatching here and there, trying all the schemes teeming in his\ningenious and supremely sensible mind in the hope of setting the wreck\nafloat again.  He could not comprehend why the old man remained alive.\nHe had seen many a human being go who was in health, in comparison with\nthis conglomerate of diseases and frailties; yet life there was, and a\nmost tenacious life.  He worked and watched, and from day to day put\noff suggesting that they telegraph for the son.  The coming of his son\nmight shake Martin's conviction that he would get well; it seemed to\nCharlton that that conviction was the one thread holding his patient\nfrom the abyss where darkness and silence reign supreme.\n\nJane could not leave the grounds.  If she had she would have seen\nVictor Dorn either not at all or at a distance.  For the campaign was\nnow approaching its climax.\n\nThe public man is always two wholly different personalities. There is\nthe man the public sees--and fancies it knows.  There is the man known\nonly to his intimates, known imperfectly to them, perhaps an unknown\nquantity even to himself until the necessity for decisive action\nreveals him to himself and to those in a position to see what he really\ndid.  Unfortunately, it is not the man the public sees but the hidden\nman who is elected to the office.  Nothing could be falser than the old\nsaw that sooner or later a man stands revealed.  Sometimes, as we well\nknow, history has not found out a man after a thousand years of\nstudying him. And the most familiar, the most constantly observed men\nin public life often round out a long career without ever having\naroused in the public more than a faint and formless suspicion as to\nthe truth about them.\n\nThe chief reason for this is that, in studying a character, no one is\ncontent with the plain and easy way of reaching an understanding of\nit--the way of looking only at its ACTS.  We all love to dabble in the\nmetaphysical, to examine and weigh motives and intentions, to compare\nourselves and make wildly erroneous judgment inevitable by listening to\nthe man's WORDS--his professions, always more or less dishonest, though\nperhaps not always deliberately so.\n\nIn that Remsen City campaign the one party that could profit by the\nfull and clear truth, and therefore was eager for the truth as to\neverything and everybody, was the Workingmen's League.  The Kelly\ncrowd, the House gang, the Citizens' Alliance, all had their ugly\nsecrets, their secret intentions different from their public\nprofessions.  All these were seeking office and power with a view to\nincreasing or perpetuating or protecting various abuses, however\nardently they might attack, might perhaps honestly intend to end,\ncertain other and much smaller abuses. The Workingmen's League said\nthat it would end every abuse existing law did not securely protect,\nand it meant what it said.\n\nIts campaign fund was the dues paid in by its members and the profits\nfrom the New Day.  Its financial books were open for free inspection.\nNot so the others--and that in itself was proof enough of sinister\nintentions.\n\nUnder Victor Dorn's shrewd direction, the League candidates published,\neach man in a sworn statement, a complete description of all the\nproperty owned by himself and by his wife.  \"The character of a man's\nproperty,\" said the New Day, \"is an indication of how that man will act\nin public affairs. Therefore, every candidate for public trust owes it\nto the people to tell them just what his property interests are.  The\nLeague candidates do this--and an effective answer the schedules make\nto the charge that the League's candidates are men who have 'no stake\nin the community.'  Now, let Mr. Sawyer, Mr. Hull, Mr. Galland and the\nrest of the League's opponents do likewise.  Let us read how many\nshares of water and ice stock Mr. Sawyer owns. Let us hear from Mr.\nHull about his traction holdings--those of the Hull estate from which\nhe draws his entire income.  As for Mr. Galland, it would be easier for\nhim to give the list of public and semi-public corporations in which he\nis not largely interested.  But let him be specific, since he asks the\npeople to trust him as judge between them and those corporations of\nwhich he is almost as large an owner as is his father-in-law.\"\n\nThis line of attack--and the publication of the largest contributors to\nthe Republican and Democratic-Reform campaign fund--caused a great deal\nof public and private discussion. Large crowds cheered Hull when he,\nwithout doing the charges the honor of repeating them,  denounced the\n\"undignified and demagogic methods of our desperate opponents.\"  The\nsmaller Sawyer crowds applauded Sawyer when he waxed indignant over the\nattempts of those \"socialists and anarchists, haters of this free\ncountry and spitters upon its glorious flag, to set poor against rich,\nto destroy our splendid American tradition of a free field and no\nfavors, and let the best man win!\"\n\nSawyer, and Davy, all the candidates of the machines and the reformers\nfor that matter, made excellent public appearances. They discoursed\neloquently about popular rights and wrongs.  They denounced corruption;\nthey stood strongly for the right and renounced and denounced the devil\nand all his works.  They promised to do far more for the people than\ndid the Leaguers; for Victor Dorn had trained his men to tell the exact\ntruth--the difficulty of doing anything for the people at any near time\nor in any brief period because at a single election but a small part of\nthe effective offices could be changed, and sweeping changes must be\nmade before there could be sweeping benefits.  \"We'll do all we can,\"\nwas their promise.  \"Their county government and their state government\nand their courts won't let us do much. But a beginning has to be made.\nLet's make it!\"\n\nDavid Hull's public appearance was especially good.  Not so effective\nas it has now become, because he was only a novice at campaigning in\nthat year.  But he looked, well--handsome, yet not too handsome, upper\nclass, but not arrogant, serious, frank and kindly.  And he talked in a\nplain, honest way--you felt that no interest, however greedy, desperate\nand powerful, would dare approach that man with an improper\nproposal--and you quite forgot in real affairs the crude improper\nproposal is never the method of approach.  When Davy, with grave\nemotion, referred to the \"pitiful efforts to smirch the personal\ncharacter of candidates,\" you could not but burn with scorn of the\nVictor Dorn tactics.  What if Hull did own gas and water and ice and\ntraction and railway stocks?  Mustn't a rich man invest his money\nsomehow?  And how could he more creditably invest it than in local\nenterprises and in enterprises that opened up the country and gave\nemployment to labor?  What if the dividends were improperly, even\ncriminally, earned?  Must he therefore throw the dividends paid him\ninto the street?  As for a man of such associations and financial\ninterests being unfit fairly to administer public affairs, what\nbalderdash!  Who could be more fit than this educated, high minded man,\nof large private means, willing to devote himself to the public service\ninstead of drinking himself to death or doing nothing at all.  You\nwould have felt, as you looked at Davy and listened to him, that it was\nlittle short of marvelous that a man could be so self-sacrificing as to\nconsent to run the gauntlet of low mudslingers for no reward but an\noffice with a salary of three thousand a year.  And you would have been\nafraid that, if something was not done to stop these mudslingers, such\nmen as David Hull would abandon their patriotic efforts to save their\ncountry--and then WHAT would become of the country?\n\nBut Victor and his associates--on the platform, in the paper, in\nposters and dodgers and leaflets--continued to press home the ugly\nquestions--and continued to call attention to the fact that, while\nthere had been ample opportunity, none of the candidates had answered\nany of the questions.  And presently--keeping up this line of\nattack--Victor opened out in another.  He had Falconer, the League\ncandidate for judge, draw up a careful statement of exactly what each\npublic officer could do under existing law to end or to check the most\nflagrant of the abuses from which the people of Remsen City were\nsuffering.  With this statement as a basis, he formulated a series of\nquestions--\"Yes or no?  If you are elected, will you or will you not?\"\nThe League candidates promptly gave the specific pledges.  Sawyer\ndodged.  David Hull was more adroit.  He held up a copy of the list of\nquestions at a big meeting in Odd Fellows' Hall.\n\n\"Our opponents have resorted to a familiar trick--the question and the\npledge.\"  (Applause.  Sensation.  Fear lest \"our candidate\" was about\nto \"put his foot in it.\")  \"We need resort to no tricks.  I promptly\nand frankly, for our whole ticket, answer their questions.  I say, 'We\nwill lay hold of ANY and EVERY abuse, as soon as it presents itself,\nand WILL SMASH IT.\"\n\nApplause, cheers, whistlings--a demonstration lasting nearly five\nminutes by a watch held by Gamaliel Tooker, who had a mania for\ngathering records of all kinds and who had voted for every Republican\ncandidate for President since the party was founded. Davy did not again\nrefer to Victor Dorn's questions.  But Victor continued to press them\nand to ask whether a public officer ought not to go and present himself\nto abuses, instead of waiting for them to hunt him out and present\nthemselves to him.\n\nSuch was the campaign as the public saw it.  And such was in reality\nthe campaign of the Leaguers.  But the real campaign--the one conducted\nby Kelly and House--was entirely different.  They were not talking;\nthey were working.\n\nThey were working on a plan based somewhat after this fashion:\n\nIn former and happier days, when people left politics to politicians\nand minded their own business, about ninety-five per cent. of the\nvoters voted their straight party tickets like good soldiers.  Then\npolitics was a high-class business, and politicians devoted themselves\nto getting out the full party vote and to buying or cajoling to one\nside or the other the doubtful ten per cent that held the balance of\npower.  That golden age, however, had passed.  People had gotten into\nthe habit of fancying that, because certain men had grown very, very\nrich through their own genius for money-making, supplemented perhaps by\naccidental favors from law and public officials, therefore politics in\nsome way might possibly concern the private citizen, might account for\nthe curious discrepancy between his labor and its reward.  The\nimpression was growing that, while the energy of the citizen determined\nthe PRODUCTION of wealth, it was politics that determined the\ndistribution of wealth.  And under the influence of this impression,\nthe percentage of sober, steady, reliable voters who \"stood by the\ngrand old party\" had shrunk to about seventy, while the percentage of\nvoters who had to be worried about had grown to about thirty.\n\nThe Kelly-House problem was, what shall we do as to that annoying\nthirty per cent?\n\nKelly--for he was THE brain of the bi-partisan machine, proposed to\nthrow the election to the House-Reform \"combine.\"  His henchmen and\nHouse's made a careful poll, and he sat up all night growing haggard\nand puffy-eyed over the result.  According to this poll, not only was\nthe League's entire ticket to be elected, but also Galland, despite his\nhaving the Republican, the Democratic and the Reform nominations, was\nto be beaten by the League's Falconer.  He couldn't understand it.  The\nSawyer meetings were quite up to his expectations and indicated that\nthe Republican rank and file was preparing to swallow the Sawyer dose\nwithout blinking.  The Alliance and the Democratic meetings were\nequally satisfactory.  Hull was \"making a hit.\"  Everywhere he had big\ncrowds and enthusiasm.  The League meetings were only slightly better\nattended than during the last campaign; no indication there of the\nLeague \"landslide.\"\n\nYet Kelly could not, dared not, doubt that poll.  It was his only safe\nguide.  And it assured him that the long-dreaded disaster was at hand.\nIn vain was the clever trick of nominating a popular, \"clean\" young\nreformer and opposing him with an unpopular regular of the most\noffensive type--more offensive even than a professional politician of\nunsavory record.  At last victory was to reward the tactics of Victor\nDorn, the slow, patient building which for several years now had been\nrasping the nerves of Boss Kelly.\n\nWhat should he do?\n\nIt was clear to him that the doom of the old system was settled. The\nplutocrats, the upper-class crowd--the \"silk stockings,\" as they had\nbeen called from the days when men wore knee-breeches--they fancied\nthat this nation-wide movement was sporadic, would work out in a few\nyears, and that the people would return to their allegiance.  Kelly had\nno such delusions. Issuing from the depths of the people, he\nunderstood.  They were learning a little something at last.  They were\ndiscovering that the ever higher prices for everything and stationary\nor falling wages and salaries had some intimate relation with politics;\nthat at the national capitol, at the state capitol, in the county\ncourthouse, in the city hall their share of the nation's vast annual\nproduction of wealth was being determined--and that the persons doing\nthe dividing, though elected by them, were in the employ of the\nplutocracy.  Kelly, seeing and comprehending, felt that it behooved him\nto get for his masters--and for himself--all that could be got in the\nbrief remaining time.  Not that he was thinking of giving up the game;\nnothing so foolish as that.  It would be many a year before the\nplutocracy could be routed out, before the people would have the\nintelligence and the persistence to claim and to hold their own.  In\nthe meantime, they could be fooled and robbed by a hundred tricks.  He\nwas not a constitutional lawyer, but he had practical good sense, and\ncould enjoy the joke upon the people in their entanglement in the toils\nof their own making.  Through fear of governmental tyranny they had\ndivided authority among legislators, executives and judges, national,\nstate, local.  And, behold, outside of the government, out where they\nhad never dreamed of looking, had grown up a tyranny that was\nperpetuating itself by dodging from one of these divided authorities to\nanother, eluding capture, wearing out the not too strong perseverance\nof popular pursuit.\n\nBut, thanks to Victor Dorn, the local graft was about to be taken away\nfrom the politicians and the plutocracy.  How put off that unpleasant\nevent?  Obviously, in the only way left unclosed.  The election must be\nstolen.\n\nIt is a very human state of mind to feel that what one wants somehow\nhas already become in a sense one's property.  It is even more\nprofoundly human to feel that what one has had, however wrongfully,\ncannot justly be taken away.  So Mr. Kelly did not regard himself as a\nthief, taking what did not belong to him; no, he was holding on to and\ndefending his own.\n\nVictor Dorn had not been in politics since early boyhood without\nlearning how the political game is conducted in all its branches.\n\nBecause there had never been the remotest chance of victory, Victor had\nnever made preelection polls of his party.  So the first hint that he\ngot of there being a real foundation for the belief of some of his\nassociates in an impending victory was when he found out that Kelly and\nHouse were \"colonizing\" voters, and were selecting election officers\nwith an eye to \"dirty work.\" These preparations, he knew, could not be\nmaking for the same reason as in the years before the \"gentlemen's\nagreement\" between the Republican and the Democratic machines.  Kelly,\nhe knew, wanted House and the Alliance to win.  Therefore, the\ncolonizations in the slums and the appointing of notorious buckos to\npositions where they would control the ballot boxes could be directed\nonly against the Workingmen's League.  Kelly must have accurate\ninformation that the League was likely, or at least not unlikely, to\nwin.\n\nVictor had thought he had so schooled himself that victory and defeat\nwere mere words to him.  He soon realized how he had overestimated the\npower of philosophy over human nature.  During that campaign he had\nbeen imagining that he was putting all his ability, all his energy, all\nhis resourcefulness into the fight. He now discovered his mistake.\nHope--definite hope--of victory had hardly entered his mind before he\nwas organizing and leading on such a campaign as Remsen City had never\nknown in all its history--and Remsen City was in a state where politics\nis the chief distraction of the people.  Sleep left him; he had no need\nof sleep.  Day and night his brain worked, pouring out a steady stream\nof ideas.  He became like a gigantic electric storage battery to which\na hundred, a thousand small batteries come for renewal.  He charged his\nassociates afresh each day.  And they in turn became amazingly more\npowerful forces for acting upon the minds of the people.\n\nIn the last week of the campaign it became common talk throughout the\ncity that the \"Dorn crowd\" would probably carry the election.  Kelly\nwas the only one of the opposition leaders who could maintain a calm\nfront.  Kelly was too seasoned a gambler even to show his feelings in\nhis countenance, but, had he been showing them, his following would not\nhave been depressed, for he had made preparations to meet and overcome\nany majority short of unanimity which the people might roll up against\nhim.  The discouragement in the House-Alliance camps became so apparent\nthat Kelly sent his chief lieutenant, Wellman, successor to the\nfugitive Rivers, to House and to David Hull with a message.  It was\ndelivered to Hull in this form:\n\n\"The old man says he wants you to stop going round with your chin\nknocking against your knees.  He says everybody is saying you have\ngiven up the fight.\"\n\n\"Our meetings these last few days are very discouraging,\" said Davy\ngloomily.\n\n\"What's meetin's?\" retorted Wellman.  \"You fellows that shoot off your\nmouths think you're doing the campaigning.  But the real stuff is being\ndoped up by us fellows who ain't seen or heard. The old man says you\nare going to win.  That's straight.  He knows.  It's only a question of\nthe size of your majority.  So pull yourself together, Mr. Hull, and\nput the ginger back into your speeches, and stir up that there gang of\ndudes.  What a gang of Johnnies and quitters they are!\"\n\nHull was looking directly and keenly at the secret messenger. Upon his\nlips was a question he dared not ask.  Seeing the impudent, disdainful\nsmile in Wellman's eyes, he hastily shifted his glance.  It was most\nuncomfortable, this suspicion of the hidden meaning of the Kelly\nmessage--a suspicion ALMOST confirmed by that mocking smile of the\nmessenger.  Hull said with embarrassment:\n\n\"Tell Mr. Kelly I'm much obliged.\"\n\n\"And you'll begin to make a fight again?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Davy impatiently.\n\nWhen he was alone he became once more involved in one of those internal\nstruggles to prevent himself from seeing--and smelling--a hideous and\nmalodorous truth.  These struggles were painfully frequent.  The only\nconsolation the young reformer found was that they were increasingly\nless difficult to end in the way such struggles  must be ended if a\nhigh-minded young man is to make a career in \"practical\" life.\n\nOn election day after he had voted he went for a long walk in the woods\nto the south of the town, leaving word at his headquarters what\ndirection he had taken.  After walking two hours he sat down on a log\nin the shade near where the highroad crossed Foaming Creek.  He became\nso absorbed in his thoughts that he sprang to his feet with a wild look\nwhen Selma's voice said, close by:\n\n\"May I interrupt a moment, Mr. Hull?\"\n\nHe recovered slowly.  His cheeks were pale and his voice uncertain as\nhe replied:\n\n\"You?  I beg your pardon.  This campaign has played smash with my\nnerves.\"\n\nHe now noted that she was regarding him with a glance so intense that\nit seemed to concentrate all the passion and energy in that slim,\nnervous body of hers.  He said uncomfortably:\n\n\"You wished to see me?\"\n\n\"I wonder what you were thinking about,\" she said in her impetuous,\ndirect way.  \"It makes me almost afraid to ask what I came to ask.\"\n\n\"Won't you sit?\" said he.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" replied she.\n\n\"Then you'll compel me to stand.  And I'm horribly tired.\"\n\nShe seated herself upon the log.  He made himself comfortable at its\nother end.\n\n\"I've just come from Victor Dorn's house,\" said she.  \"There was a\nconsultation among the leaders of our party.  We have learned that your\npeople--Kelly and House--are going to steal the election on the count\nthis evening.  They are committing wholesale frauds now--sending round\ngangs of repeaters, intimidating our voters, openly buying votes at the\npolling places--paying men as much not to vote as they usually pay for\nvotes.\"\n\nDavy, though latterly he had grown so much older and graver that no one\nnow thought of him as Davy, contrived to muster a smile of amusement.\n\"You oughtn't to let them deceive you with that silly talk, Miss\nGordon.  The losers always indulge in it.  Your good sense must tell\nyou how foolish it is.  The police are on guard, and the courts of\njustice are open.\"\n\n\"Yes--the police are on guard--to protect fraud and to drive us away\nfrom the polls.  And the courts are open--but not for us.\"\n\nDavid was gentle with her.  \"I know how sincere you are, Selma,\" said\nhe.  \"No doubt you believe those things.  Perhaps Dorn believes them,\nalso--from repeating them so often.  But all the same I'm sorry to hear\nyou say them.\"\n\nHe tried to look at her.  He found that his eyes were more comfortable\nwhen his glance was elsewhere.\n\n\"This has been a sad campaign to me,\" he went on.  \"I did not\nappreciate before what demagogery meant--how dangerous it is--how\nwicked, how criminally wicked it is for men to stir up the lower\nclasses against the educated leadership of the community.\"\n\nSelma laughed contemptuously.  \"What nonsense, David Hull--and from\nYOU!\" she cried.  \"By educated leadership do you mean the traction and\ngas and water and coal and iron and produce thieves? Or do you mean the\nofficials and the judges who protect them and license them to rob?\"\nHer eyes flashed.  \"At this very moment, in our town, those thieves and\ntheir agents, the police and the courts, are committing the most\nfrightful crime known to a free people.  Yet the masses are submitting\npeaceably.  How long the upper class has to indulge in violence, and\nhow savagely cruel it has to be, before the people even murmur.  But I\ndidn't come here to remind you of what you already know.  I came to ask\nyou, as a man whom I have respected, to assert his manhood--if there is\nany of it left after this campaign of falsehood and shifting.\"\n\n\"Selma!\" he protested energetically, but still avoiding her eyes.\n\n\"Those wretches are stealing that election for you, David Hull. Are you\ngoing to stand for it?  Or, will you go into town and force Kelly to\nstop?\"\n\n\"If anything wrong is being done by Kelly,\" said David, \"it must be for\nSawyer.\"\n\nSelma rose.  \"At our consultation,\" said she quietly and even with no\nsuggestion of repressed emotion, \"they debated coming to you and laying\nthe facts before you.  They decided against it. They were right; I was\nwrong.  I pity you, David Hull. Good-by.\"\n\nShe walked away.  He hesitated, observing her.  His eyes lighted up\nwith the passion he believed his good sense had conquered. \"Selma,\ndon't misjudge me!\" he cried, following her.  \"I am not the scoundrel\nthey're making you believe me.  I love you!\"\n\nShe wheeled upon him so fiercely that he started back.  \"How dare you!\"\nshe said, her voice choking with anger.  \"You miserable fraud!  You\nbellwether for the plutocracy, to lead reform movements off on a false\nscent, off into the marshes where they'll be suffocated.\"  She looked\nat him from head to foot with a withering glance.  \"No doubt, you'll\nhave what's called a successful career.  You'll be their traitor leader\nfor the radicals they want to bring to confusion.  When the people cry\nfor a reform you'll shout louder than anybody else--and you'll be made\nleader--and you'll lead--into the marshes.  Your followers will perish,\nbut you'll come back, ready for the next treachery for which the\nplutocracy needs you.  And you'll look honest and respectable--and\nyou'll talk virtue and reform and justice.  But you'll know what you\nare yourself.  David Hull, I despise you as much as you despise\nyourself.\"\n\nHe did not follow as she walked away.  He returned to the log, and\nslowly reseated himself.  He was glad of the violent headache that made\nthought impossible.\n\n\nRemsen City, boss-ridden since the Civil War, had experienced many a\nturbulent election day and night.  The rivalries of the two bosses,\ncontending for the spoils where the electorate was evenly divided, had\nmade the polling places in the poorer quarters dangerous all day and\nscenes of rioting at night.  But latterly there had been a notable\nimprovement.  People who entertained the pleasant and widespread\ndelusion that statute laws offset the habits and customs of men,\nrestrain the strong and protect the weak, attributed the improvement to\nsundry vigorously worded enactments of the legislature on the subject\nof election frauds.  In fact, the real bottom cause of the change was\nthe \"gentlemen's agreement\" between the two party machines whereunder\nboth entered the service of the same master, the plutocracy.\n\nNever in Remsen City history had there been grosser frauds than those\nof this famous election day, and never had the frauds been so open.  A\nday of scandal was followed by an evening of shame; for to overcome the\nLeague the henchmen of Kelly and House had to do a great deal of\ncounting out and counting in, of mutilating ballots, of destroying\nboxes with their contents.  Yet never had Remsen City seen so peaceful\nan election.  Representatives of the League were at every polling\nplace.  They protested; they took names of principals and witnesses in\neach case of real or suspected fraud.  They appealed to the courts from\ntime to time and got rulings--always against them, even where the\nletter of the decision was in their favor.  They did all this in the\nquietest manner conceivable, without so much as an expression of\nindignation.  And when the results were announced--a sweeping victory\nfor Hull and the fusion ticket, Hugo Galland elected by five hundred\nover Falconer--the Leaguers made no counter demonstration as the\ndrunken gangs of machine heelers paraded in the streets with bands and\ntorches.\n\nKelly observed and was uneasy.  What could be the meaning of this meek\nacceptance of a theft so flagrant that the whole town was talking about\nit?  What was Victor Dorn's \"game\"?\n\nHe discovered the next day.  The executive committee of the League\nworked all night; the League's printers and presses worked from six\no'clock in the morning until ten.  At half-past ten Remsen City was\nflooded with a special edition of the New Day, given away by Leaguers\nand their wives and sons and daughters--a monster special edition paid\nfor with the last money in the League's small campaign chest.  This\nspecial was a full account of the frauds that had been committed.  No\nindictment could have been more complete, could have carried within\nitself more convincing proofs of the truth of its charges.  The New Day\ndeclared that the frauds were far more extensive than it was able to\nprove; but it insisted upon, and took into account, only those frauds\nthat could be proved in a \"court of justice--if Remsen City had a court\nof justice, which the treatment of the League's protectors at the\nCourthouse yesterday shows that it has not.\" The results of the\nLeague's investigations were tabulated.  The New Day showed:\n\nFirst, that while Harbinger, the League candidate for Mayor, had\nactually polled 5,280 votes at least, and David Hull had polled less\nthan 3,950, the election had been so manipulated that in the official\ncount 4,827 votes were given to Hull and 3,980 votes to Harbinger.\n\nSecond, that in the actual vote Falconer had beaten Hugo Galland by\n1,230 at least; that in the official count Galland was declared elected\nby a majority of 672.\n\nThird, that these results were brought about by wholesale fraudulent\nvoting, one gang of twenty-two repeaters casting upwards of a thousand\nvotes at the various polling places; also by false counting, the number\nof votes reported exceeding the number cast by between two and three\nthousand.\n\nAs a piece of workmanship the document was an amazing illustration of\nthe genius of Victor Dorn.  Instead of violence against violence,\ninstead of vague accusation, here was a calm, orderly proof of the\nLeague's case, of the outrage that had been done the city and its\ncitizens.  Before night fell the day after the election there was no\none in Remsen City who did not know the truth.\n\nThe three daily newspapers ignored the special.  They continued to\ncongratulate Remsen City upon the \"vindication of the city's fame for\nsound political sense,\" as if there had been no protest against the\nofficial version of the election returns.  Nor did the press of the\nstate or the country contain any reference to the happenings at Remsen\nCity.  But Remsen City knew, and that was the main point sought by\nVictor Dorn.\n\nA committee of the League with copies of the special edition and\ntranscripts of the proofs in the possession of the League went in\nsearch of David Hull and Hugo Galland.  Both were out of town, \"resting\nin retirement from the fatigue of the campaign.\"  The prosecuting\nattorney of the county was seen, took the documents, said he would look\ninto the matter, bowed the committee out--and did as Kelly counted on\nhis doing.  The grand jury heard, but could not see its way clear to\nreturning indictments; no one was upon a grand jury in that county\nunless he had been passed by Kelly or House.  Judge Freilig and Judge\nLansing referred the committee to the grand jury and to the county\nprosecutor.\n\nWhen the League had tried the last avenue to official justice and had\nfound the way barred, House meeting Kelly in the Palace Hotel cafe',\nsaid:\n\n\"Well, Richard, I guess it's all over.\" Kelly nodded.  \"You've got away\nwith the goods.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised at Dorn's taking it so quietly,\" said House. \"I rather\nexpected he'd make trouble.\"\n\nKelly vented a short, grunting laugh.  \"Trouble--hell!\" ejaculated he.\n\"If he'd 'a' kicked up a fight we'd 'a' had him. But he was too 'cute\nfor that, damn him.  So next time he wins.\"\n\n\"Oh, folks ain't got no memories--especially for politics,\" said House\neasily.\n\n\"You'll see,\" retorted Kelly.  \"The next mayor of this town'll be a\nLeaguer, and by a majority that can't be trifled with.  So make hay\nwhile the sun shines, Joe.  After this administration there'll be a\nlong stretch of bad weather for haying.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to get hold of Hull,\" said House, and it was not difficult\nto read his train of thought.  \"I was a LEETLE afraid he was going to\nbe scared by that document of Dorn's--and was going to do something\ncrazy.\"\n\nAgain Kelly emitted his queer grunting laugh.  \"I guess he was a LEETLE\nafraid he would, too, and ran away and hid to get back his nerve.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's all right.  He's a pushing, level-headed fellow, and won't\nmake no trouble.  Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Trouble?  I should say not.  How can he--if he takes the job?\"\n\nTo which obvious logic no assent was necessary.\n\nDavy's abrupt departure was for the exact reason Mr. Kelly ascribed.\nAnd he had taken Hugo with him because he feared that he would say or\ndo something to keep the scandal from dying the quick death of all\nscandals.  There was the less difficulty in dissuading him from staying\nto sun himself in the glories of his new rank and title because his\nwife had cast him adrift for the time and was stopping at the house of\nher father, whose death was hourly expected.\n\nOld Hastings had been in a stupor for several weeks.  He astonished\neverybody, except Dr. Charlton, by rousing on election night and asking\nhow the battle had gone.\n\n\"And he seemed to understand what I told him,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Certainly he understood,\" replied Charlton.  \"The only part of him\nthat's in any sort of condition is his mind, because it's the only part\nof him that's been properly exercised.  Most people die at the top\nfirst because they've never in all their lives used their minds when\nthey could possibly avoid it.\"\n\nIn the week following the election he came out of his stupor again.  He\nsaid to the nurse:\n\n\"It's about supper time, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered she.  \"They're all down at din--supper. Shall I call\nthem?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"I want to go down to her room.\"\n\n\"To Miss Jane's room?\" asked the puzzled nurse.\n\n\"To my wife's room,\" said Hastings crossly.\n\nThe nurse, a stranger, thought his mind was wandering. \"Certainly,\"\nsaid she soothingly.  \"In a few minutes--as soon as you've rested a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"You're a fool!\" mumbled Hastings.  \"Call Jinny.\"\n\nThe nurse obeyed.  When he repeated his request to Jane, she hesitated.\nThe tears rolled down his cheeks.  \"I know what I'm about,\" he pleaded.\n\"Send for Charlton.  He'll tell you to let me have my way.\"\n\nJane decided that it was best to yield.  The shrunken figure, weighing\nso little that it was terrifying to lift it, was wrapped warmly, and\nput in an invalid chair.  With much difficulty the chair was got out\ninto the hall and down the stairs.  Then they wheeled it into the room\nwhere he was in the habit of sitting after supper.  When he was\nopposite the atrocious crayon enlargement of his wife an expression of\nsupreme content settled upon his features.  Said he:\n\n\"Go back to your supper, Jinny.  Take the nurse woman with you. I want\nto be by myself.\"\n\nThe nurse glanced stealthily in from time to time during the next hour.\nShe saw that his eyes were open, were fixed upon the picture.  When\nJane came she ventured to enter.  She said:\n\n\"Do you mind my sitting with you, father?\"\n\nHe did not answer.  She went to him, touched him.  He was dead.\n\nAs a rule death is not without mitigations, consolations even. Where it\nis preceded by a long and troublesome illness, disrupting the routine\nof the family and keeping everybody from doing the things he or she\nwishes, it comes as a relief.  In this particular case not only was the\ndeath a relief, but also the estate of the dead man provided all the\nchief mourners with instant and absorbing occupation.  If he had left a\nwill, the acrimony of the heirs would have been caused by\ndissatisfaction with his way of distributing the property.  Leaving no\nwill, he plunged the three heirs--or, rather, the five heirs, for the\nhusband of Martha and the wife of the son were most important\nfactors--he plunged the five heirs into a ferment of furious dispute as\nto who was to have what.  Martha and her husband and the\ndaughter-in-law were people of exceedingly small mind. Trifles,\ntherefore, agitated them to the exclusion of larger matters.  The three\nfell to quarreling violently over the division of silverware, jewelry\nand furniture.  Jane was so enraged by the \"disgusting spectacle\" that\nshe proceeded to take part in it and to demand everything which she\nthought it would irritate Martha Galland or Irene Hastings to have to\ngive up.\n\nThe three women and Hugo--for Hugo loved petty wrangling--spent day\nafter day in the bitterest quarrels.  Each morning Jane, ashamed\novernight, would issue from her room resolved to have no part in the\nvulgar rowdyism.  Before an hour had passed she would be the angriest\nof the disputants.  Except her own unquestioned belongings there wasn't\na thing in the house or stables about which she cared in the least.\nBut there was a principle at stake--and for principle she would fight\nin the last ditch.\n\nNone of them wished to call in arbitrators or executors; why go to that\nexpense?  So, the bickering and wrangling, the insults and tears and\nsneers went on from day to day.  At last they settled the whole matter\nby lot--and by a series of easily arranged exchanges where the results\nof the drawings were unsatisfactory.  Peace was restored, but not\nliking.  Each of the three groups--Hugo and Martha, Will and Irene,\nJane in a group by herself--detested the other two.  They felt that\nthey had found each other out.  As Martha said to Hugo, \"It takes a\nthing of this kind to show people up in their true colors.\"  Or, as\nJane said to Doctor Charlton, \"What beasts human beings are!\"\n\nSaid he:  \"What beasts circumstance makes of some of them sometimes.\"\n\n\"You are charitable,\" said Jane.\n\n\"I am scientific,\" replied he.  \"It's very intelligent to go about\ndistributing praise and blame.  To do that is to obey a slightly higher\ndevelopment of the instinct that leads one to scowl at and curse the\nstone he stumps his toe on.  The sensible thing to do is to look at the\ncauses of things--of brutishness in human beings, for example--and to\nremove those causes.\"\n\n\"It was wonderful, the way you dragged father back to life and almost\nsaved him.  That reminds me.  Wait a second, please.\"\n\nShe went up to her room and got the envelope addressed to Charlton\nwhich she had found in the drawer, as her father directed.  Charlton\nopened it, took out five bank notes each of a thousand dollars.  She\nglanced at the money, then at his face. It did not express the emotion\nshe was expecting.  On the contrary, its look was of pleased curiosity.\n\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" he said, reflectively.  \"Your father certainly\nwas a queer mixture of surprises and contradictions. Now, who would\nhave suspected him of a piece of sentiment like this?  Pure sentiment.\nHe must have felt that I'd not be able to save him, and he knew my bill\nwouldn't be one-tenth this sum.\"\n\n\"He liked you, and admired you,\" said Jane.\n\n\"He was very generous where he liked and admired.\"\n\nCharlton put the money back in the envelope, put the envelope in his\npocket.  \"I'll give the money to the Children's Hospital,\" said he.\n\"About six months ago I completed the sum I had fixed on as necessary\nto my independence; so, I've no further use for money--except to use it\nup as it comes in.\"\n\n\"You may marry some day,\" suggested Jane.\n\n\"Not a woman who wishes to be left richer than independent,\" replied\nhe.  \"As for the children, they'll be brought up to earn their own\nindependence.  I'll leave only incubators and keepsakes when I die.\nBut no estate.  I'm not that foolish and inconsiderate.\"\n\n\"What a queer idea!\" exclaimed Jane.\n\n\"On the contrary, it's simplest common sense.  The idea of giving\npeople something they haven't earned--that's the queer idea.\"\n\n\"You are SO like Victor Dorn!\"\n\n\"That reminds me!\" exclaimed Charlton.  \"It was very negligent of me to\nforget.  The day your father died I dropped in on Victor and told\nhim--him and Selma Gordon--about it.  And both asked me to take you\ntheir sympathy.  They said a great deal about your love for your\nfather, and how sad it was to lose him.  They were really distressed.\"\n\nJane's face almost brightened.  \"I've been rather hurt because I hadn't\nreceived a word of sympathy from--them,\" she said.\n\n\"They'd have come, themselves, except that politics has made a very\nugly feeling against them--and Galland's your brother-in-law.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Jane.  \"But I'm not Galland--and not of that\nparty.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you are of that party,\" replied Charlton.  \"You draw your\nincome from it, and one belongs to whatever he draws his income from.\nCivilization means property--as yet.  And it doesn't mean men and\nwomen--as yet.  So, to know the man or the woman we look at the\nproperty.\"\n\n\"That's hideously unjust,\" cried Jane.\n\n\"Don't be utterly egotistical,\" said Charlton.  \"Don't attach so much\nimportance to your little, mortal, WEAK personality.  Try to realize\nthat you're a mere chip in the great game of chance. You're a chip with\nthe letter P on it--which stands for Plutocracy.  And you'll be played\nas you're labeled.\"\n\n\"You make it very hard for any one to like you.\"\n\n\"Well--good-by, then.\"\n\nAnd ignoring her hasty, half-laughing, half-serious protests he took\nhimself away.  She was intensely irritated.  A rapid change in her\noutward character had been going forward since her father's death--a\nchange in the direction of intensifying the traits that had always been\nreally dominant, but had been less apparent because softened by other\ntraits now rapidly whithering.\n\nThe cause of the change was her inheritance.\n\nMartin Hastings, remaining all his life in utter ignorance of the showy\nuses of wealth and looking on it with the eyes of a farm hand, had\nremained the enriched man of the lower classes, at heart a member of\nhis original class to the end.  The effect of this upon Jane had been\nto keep in check all the showy and arrogant, all the upper class,\ntendencies which education and travel among the upper classes of the\nEast and of Europe had implanted in her.  So long as plain old Martin\nlived, she could not FEEL the position she had--or, rather, would some\nday have--in the modern social system.  But just as soon as he passed\naway, just as soon as she became a great heiress, actually in\npossession of that which made the world adore, that which would buy\nservility, flattery, awe--just so soon did she begin to be an\nupper-class lady.\n\nShe had acquired a superficial knowledge of business--enough to enable\nher to understand what the various items in the long, long schedule of\nher holdings meant.  Symbols of her importance, of her power.  She had\nstudied the \"great ladies\" she had met in her travels and visitings.\nShe had been impressed by the charm of the artistic, carefully\ncultivated air of simplicity and equality affected by the greatest of\nthese great ladies as those born to wealth and position.  To be gentle\nand natural, to be gracious--that was the \"proper thing.\"  So, she now\nadopted a manner that was if anything too kindly.  Her pose, her mask,\nbehind which she was concealing her swollen and still swelling pride\nand sense of superiority, as yet fitted badly.  She \"overacted,\" as\nyouth is apt to do.  She would have given a shrewd observer--one not\ndazzled by her wealth beyond the power of clear sight--the impression\nthat she was pitying the rest of mankind, much as we all pity and\nforbear with a hopeless cripple.\n\nBut the average observer would simply have said:  \"What a sweet,\nnatural girl, so unspoiled by her wealth!\"--just as the hopeless\ncripple says, \"What a polite person,\" as he gets the benefit of\neffusive good manners that would, if he were shrewd, painfully remind\nhim that he was an unfortunate creature.\n\nOf all the weeds that infest the human garden snobbishness, the\ncommonest, is the most prolific, and it is a mighty cross breeder,\ntoo--modifying every flower in the garden, changing colors from rich to\nglaring, changing odors from perfumes to sickening-sweet or to\nstenches.  The dead hands of Martin Hastings scattered showers of\nshining gold upon his daughter's garden; and from these seeds was\nspringing a heavy crop of that most prolific of weeds.\n\nShe was beginning to resent Charlton's manner--bluff, unceremonious,\ncandid, at times rude.  He treated women exactly as he treated men, and\nhe treated all men as intimates, free and easy fellow travelers afoot\nupon a dusty, vulgar highway.  She had found charm in that manner, so\nnatural to the man of no pretense, of splendid physical proportions, of\nthe health of a fine tree.  She was beginning to get into the state of\nmind at which practically all very rich people in a civilized society\nsooner or later arrive--a state of mind that makes it impossible for\nany to live with or near them except hirelings and dependents.  The\nhabit of power of any kind breeds intolerance of equality of level\nintercourse.  This is held in check, often held entirely in check,\nwhere the power is based upon mental superiority; for the very\nsuperiority of the mind keeps alive the sense of humor and the sense of\nproportion.  Not so the habit of money power.  For money power is\nbrutal, mindless.  And as it is the only real power in any and all\naristocracies, aristocracies are inevitably brutal and brutalizing.\n\nIf Jane had been poor, or had remained a few years longer--until her\ncharacter was better set--under the restraining influence of her\nunfrilled and unfrillable father, her passion for power, for\nsuperiority would probably have impelled her to develop her mind into a\nsource of power and position.  Fate abruptly gave her the speediest and\neasiest means to power known in our plutocratic civilization.  She\nwould have had to be superhuman in beauty of character or a genius in\nmind to have rejected the short and easy way to her goal and struggled\non in the long and hard--and doubtful--way.\n\nShe did not herself appreciate the change within herself.  She fancied\nshe was still what she had been two weeks before.  For as yet nothing\nhad occurred to enable her to realize her changed direction, her\nchanged view of life.  Thus, she was still thinking of Victor Dorn as\nshe had thought of him; and she was impatient to see him.  She was now\nfree FREE!  She could, without consulting anybody, have what she\nwanted.  And she wanted Victor Dorn.\n\nShe had dropped from her horse and with her arm through the bridle was\nstrolling along one of the quieter roads which Victor often took in his\nrambles.  It was a tonic October day, with floods of sunshine upon the\ngorgeous autumnal foliage, never more gorgeous than in that fall of the\nhappiest alternations of frost and warmth.  She heard the pleasant\nrustle of quick steps in the fallen leaves that carpeted the byroad.\nShe knew it was he before she glanced; and his first view of her face\nwas of its beauty enhanced by a color as delicate and charming as that\nin the leaves about them.\n\nShe looked at his hands in which he was holding something half\nconcealed.  \"What is it?\" she said, to cover her agitation.\n\nHe opened his hands a little wider.  \"A bird,\" said he.  \"Some hunter\nhas broken its wing.  I'm taking it to Charlton for repairs and a fair\nstart for its winter down South.\"\n\nHis eyes noted for an instant significantly her sombre riding costume,\nthen sought her eyes with an expression of simple and friendly\nsympathy.  The tears came to her eyes, and she turned her face away.\nShe for the first time had a sense of loss, a moving memory of her\nfather's goodness to her, of an element of tenderness that had passed\nout of her life forever.  And she felt abjectly ashamed--ashamed of her\nrelief at the lifting of the burden of his long struggle against death,\nashamed of her miserable wranglings with Martha and Billy's wife,\nashamed of her forgetfulness of her father in the exultation over her\nwealth, ashamed of the elaborately fashionable mourning she was\nwearing--and of the black horse she had bought to match.  She hoped he\nwould not observe these last flauntings of the purely formal character\nof a grief that was being utilized to make a display of fashionableness.\n\n\"You always bring out the best there is in me,\" said she.\n\nHe stood silently before her--not in embarrassment, for he was rarely\nself-conscious enough to be embarrassed, but refraining from speech\nsimply because there was nothing to say.\n\n\"I haven't heard any of the details of the election,\" she went on.\n\"Did you come out as well as you hoped?\"\n\n\"Better,\" said he.  \"As a result of the election the membership of the\nLeague has already a little more than doubled. We could have quadrupled\nit, but we are somewhat strict in our requirements.  We want only those\nwho will stay members as long as they stay citizens of Remsen City.\nBut I must go on to Charlton or he'll be out on his rounds.\"\n\nShe caught his glance, which was inclined to avoid hers.  She gave him\na pleading look.  \"I'll walk with you part of the way,\" she said.\n\nHe seemed to be searching for an excuse to get away.  Whether because\nhe failed to find it or because he changed his mind, he said:  \"You'll\nnot mind going at a good gait?\"\n\n\"I'll ride,\" said she.  \"It's not comfortable, walking fast in these\nboots.\"\n\nHe stood by to help her, but let her get into the saddle alone. She\nsmiled down at him with a little coquetry.  \"Are you afraid to touch\nme--to-day?\" she asked.\n\nHe laughed:  \"The bird IS merely an excuse,\" he admitted. \"I've got\nback my self-control, and I purpose to keep it.\"\n\nShe flushed angrily.  His frankness now seemed to her to be flavored\nwith impertinent assurance.  \"That's amusing,\" said she, with an\nunpleasant smile.  \"You have an extraordinary opinion of yourself,\nhaven't you?\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders as if the subject did not interest him and\nset off at a gait that compelled her horse to a rapid walk. She said\npresently:\n\n\"I'm going to live at the old place alone for the present. You'll come\nto see me?\"\n\nHe looked at her.  \"No,\" he said.  \"As I told you a moment ago, that's\nover.  You'll have to find some one else to amuse you--for, I\nunderstand perfectly, Jane, that you were only doing what's called\nflirting.  That sort of thing is a waste of time--for me.  I'm not\ncompetent to judge whether it's a waste for you.\"\n\nShe looked coldly down at him.  \"You have changed since I last saw\nyou,\" she said.  \"I don't mean the change in your manner toward me.  I\nmean something deeper.  I've often heard that politics makes a man\ndeteriorate.  You must be careful, Victor.\"\n\n\"I must think about that,\" said he.  \"Thank you for warning me.\"\n\nHis prompt acceptance of her insincere criticism made her straightway\nrepentant.  \"No, it's I that have changed,\" she said.  \"Oh, I'm\nhorrid!--simply horrid.  I'm in despair about myself.\"\n\n\"Any one who thinks about himself is bound to be,\" said he\nphilosophically.  \"That's why one has to keep busy in order to keep\ncontented.\"  He halted.  \"I can save a mile and half an hour by\ncrossing these fields.\"  He held the wounded bird in one hand very\ncarefully while he lifted his hat.\n\nShe colored deeply.  \"Victor,\" she said, \"isn't there any way that you\nand I can be friends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he.  \"As I told you before, by becoming one of us.\nThose are impossible terms, of course.  But that's the only way by\nwhich we could be of use to each other.  Jane, if I, professing what I\ndo profess, offered to be friends with you on any other terms, you'd be\nvery foolish not to reject my offer. For, it would mean that I was a\nfraud.  Don't you see that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted.  \"But when I am with you I see everything exactly\nas you represent it.\"\n\n\"It's fortunate for you that I'm not disposed to take advantage of\nthat--isn't it?\" said he, with good-humored irony.\n\n\"You don't believe me!\"\n\n\"Not altogether,\" he confessed.  \"To be quite candid, I think that for\nsome reason or other I rouse in you an irresistible desire to pose.  I\ndoubt if you realize it--wholly.  But you'd be hard pressed just where\nto draw the line between the sincere and the insincere, wouldn't\nyou--honestly?\"\n\nShe sat moodily combing at her horse's mane.\n\n\"I know it's cruel,\" he went on lightly, \"to deny anything, however\nsmall, to a young lady who has always had her own way. But in\nself-defense I must do it.\"\n\n\"Why DO I take these things from you?\" she cried, in sudden\nexasperation.  And touching her horse with her stick, she was off at a\ngallop.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nFrom anger against Victor Dorn, Jane passed to anger against herself.\nThis was soon followed by a mood of self-denunciation, by astonishment\nat the follies of which she had been guilty, by shame for them.  She\ncould not scoff or scorn herself out of the infatuation.  But at least\nshe could control herself against yielding to it.  Recalling and\nreviewing all he had said, she--that is, her vanity--decided that the\nmost important remark, the only really important remark, was his\ndeclaration of disbelief in her sincerity.  \"The reason he has repulsed\nme--and a very good reason it is--is that he thinks I am simply amusing\nmyself.  If he thought I was in earnest, he would act very differently.\nVery shrewd of him!\"\n\nDid she believe this?  Certainly not.  But she convinced herself that\nshe believed it, and so saved her pride.  From this point she proceeded\nby easy stages to doubting whether, if Victor had taken her at her\nword, she would have married him.  And soon she had convinced herself\nthat she had gone so far only through her passion for conquest, that at\nthe first sign of his yielding her good sense would have asserted\nitself and she could have retreated.\n\n\"He knew me better than I knew myself,\" said she--not so thoroughly\nconvinced as her pride would have liked, but far better content with\nherself than in those unhappy hours of humiliation after her last talk\nwith him.\n\nFrom the beginning of her infatuation there had been only a few days,\nhardly more than a few hours, when the voice of prudence and good sense\nhad been silenced.  Yes, he was right; they were not suited to each\nother, and a marriage between them would have been absurd.  He did\nbelong to a different, to a lower class, and he could never have\nunderstood her.  Refinement, taste, the things of the life of luxury\nand leisure were incomprehensible to him.  It might be unjust that the\nmany had to toil in squalor and sordidness while the few were\nprivileged to cultivate and to enjoy the graces and the beauties; but,\nunjust or in some mysterious way just, there was the fact.  Her life\nwas marked out for her; she was of the elect.  She would do well to\naccept her good fortune and live as the gods had ordained for her.\n\nIf Victor had been different in that one respect!  ...  The\ninfatuation, too, was a fact.  The wise course was flight--and she fled.\n\nThat winter, in Chicago and in New York, Jane amused herself--in the\nways devised by latter day impatience with the folly of wasting a\nprecious part of the one brief life in useless grief or pretense of\ngrief.  In Remsen City she would have had to be very quiet indeed,\nunder penalty of horrifying public sentiment.  But Chicago and New York\nknew nothing of her grief, cared nothing about grief of any kind.\nPeople in deep mourning were found in the theaters, in the gay\nrestaurants, wherever any enjoyment was to be had; and very sensible it\nwas of them, and proof of the sincerity of their sorrow--for sincere\nsorrow seeks consolation lest it go mad and commit suicide--does it not?\n\nJane, young, beautiful, rich, clever, had a very good time indeed--so\ngood that in the spring, instead of going back to Remsen City to rest,\nshe went abroad.  More enjoyment--or, at least, more of the things that\nfill in the time and spare one the necessity of thinking.\n\nIn August she suddenly left her friends at St. Moritz and journeyed\nback to Remsen City as fast as train and boat and train could take her.\nAnd on the front veranda of the old house she sat herself down and\nlooked out over the familiar landscape and listened to the katydids\nlulling the woods and the fields, and was bored and wondered why she\nhad come.\n\nIn a reckless mood she went down to see Victor Dorn.  \"I am cured,\" she\nsaid to herself.  \"I must be cured.  I simply can't be small and silly\nenough to care for a country town labor agitator after all I've been\nthrough--after the attentions I've had and the men of the world I've\nmet.  I'm cured, and I must prove it to myself .\"\n\nIn the side yard Alice Sherrill and her children and several neighbor\ngirls were putting up pears and peaches, blackberries and plums.  The\nair was heavy with delicious odors of ripe and perfect fruit, and the\nlaughter, the bright healthy faces, the strong graceful bodies in all\nmanner of poses at the work required made a scene that brought tears to\nJane's eyes.  Why tears she could not have explained, but there they\nwere.  At far end of the arbor, looking exactly as he had in the same\nplace the year before, sat Victor Dorn, writing.  He glanced up, saw\nher! Into his face came a look of welcome that warmed her chilled heart.\n\n\"Hel-LO!\" he cried, starting up.  \"I AM glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I'm mighty glad to be back,\" said she, lapsing with keen pleasure into\nher native dialect.\n\nHe took both her hands and shook them cordially, then looked at her\nfrom head to foot admiringly.  \"The latest from the Rue de la Paix, I\nsuppose?\" said he.\n\nThey seated themselves with the table between them.  She, under cover\nof commonplaces about her travels, examined him with the utmost\ncalmness.  She saw every point wherein he fell short of the men of her\nclass--the sort of men she ought to like and admire.  But, oh, how dull\nand stale and narrow and petty they were, beside this man.  She knew\nnow why she had fled.  She didn't want to love Victor Dorn, or to marry\nhim--or his sort of man.  But he, his intense aliveness, his keen,\nsupple mind, had spoiled her for those others.  One of them she could\nnot marry. \"I should go mad with boredom.  One can no more live\nintimately with fashion than one can eat gold and drink diamonds.  And,\noh, but I am hungry and thirsty!\"\n\n\"So you've had a good time?\" he was saying.\n\n\"Superb,\" replied she.  \"Such scenery--such variety of people. I love\nEurope.  But--I'm glad to be home again.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can stand it,\" said Victor.\n\n\"Why?\" inquired she in surprise.\n\n\"Unless I had an intense personal interest in the most active kind of\nlife in a place like this, I should either fly or take to drink,\"\nreplied he.  \"In this world you've either got to invent occupation for\nyourself or else keep where amusements and distractions are thrust at\nyou from rising till bed-time.  And no amusements are thrust at you in\nRemsen City.\"\n\n\"But I've been trying the life of being amused,\" said Jane, \"and I've\ngot enough.\"\n\n\"For the moment,\" said Victor, laughing.  \"You'll go back. You've got\nto.  What else is there for you?\"\n\nHer eyes abruptly became serious.  \"That's what I've come home to find\nout,\" said she.  Hesitatingly, \"That's why I've come here to-day.\"\n\nHe became curiously quiet--stared at the writing before him on the\ntable.  After a while he said:\n\n\"Jane, I was entirely too glad to see you to-day.  I had----\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" she pleaded.  \"Victor, it isn't a weakness----\"\n\nHis hand resting upon the table clenched into a fist and his brows drew\ndown.  \"There can be no question but that it is a weakness and a\nfolly,\" he pushed on.  \"I will not spoil your life and mine.  You are\nnot for me, and I am not for you.  The reason we hang on to this is\nbecause each of us has a streak of tenacity.  We don't want each other,\nbut we are so made that we can't let go of an idea once it has gotten\ninto our heads.\"\n\n\"There is another reason,\" she said gently.  \"We are, both of us,\nalone--and lonesome, Victor.\"\n\n\"But I'm not alone.  I'm not lonesome----\"  And there he abruptly\nhalted, to gaze at her with the expression of awakening and\nastonishment.  \"I believe I'm wrong.  I believe you're right,\" he\nexclaimed.  \"I had never thought of that before.\"\n\n\"You've been imagining your work, your cause was enough,\" she went on\nin a quiet rational way that was a revelation--and a\nself-revelation--of the real Jane Hastings.  \"But it isn't. There's a\nwhole other side of your nature--the--the--the private side--that's the\nexpression--the private side.  And you've been denying to it its\nrights.\"\n\nHe reflected, nodded slowly.  \"I believe that's the truth,\" he said.\n\"It explains a curious feeling I've had--a sort of shriveling\nsensation.\"  He gazed thoughtfully at her, his face gradually relaxing\ninto a merry smile.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked she, smiling in turn.\n\n\"We've both got to fall in love and marry,\" said he.  \"Not with each\nother, of course--for we're not in any way mated.  But love and\nmarriage and the rest of it--that's the solution.  I don't need it\nquite as much as you do, for I've got my work.  But I need it.  Now\nthat I see things in the right light I wonder that I've been so\nstupidly blind.  Why do we human beings always overlook the obvious?\"\n\n\"It isn't easy to marry,\" said Jane, rather drearily.  \"It isn't easy\nto find some one with whom one would be willing to pass one's life.\nI've had several chances--one or two of them not entirely mercenary, I\nthink.  But not one that I could bring myself to accept.\"\n\n\"Vanity--vanity,\" said Victor.  \"Almost any human being is interesting\nand attractive if one will stop thinking about oneself and concentrate\non him or her.\"\n\nShe smiled.  \"It's evident you've never tried to fall in love.\"\n\n\"The nearest I ever came to it was with you,\" replied he. \"But that\nwas, of course, out of the question.\"\n\n\"I don't admit that,\" said she, with an amusing kind of timid obstinacy.\n\n\"Let's be honest and natural with each other,\" urged he. \"Now, Jane,\nadmit that in your heart of hearts you feel you ought not to marry me.\"\n\nHer glance avoided his.\n\n\"Come--own up!\" cried he.\n\n\"I have thought of that side of it,\" she conceded.\n\n\"And if I hadn't piqued you by thinking of it, too, you'd never have\nlingered on any other side of it,\" said he.  \"Well!  Now that we've\ncleared the ground--there's Davy.  He's to be nominated by the\nRepublicans for Governor next week.\"\n\n\"Davy?  I had almost forgotten him.  I'll think of Davy--and let you\nknow ...  And you?  Who is there for you?\"\n\n\"Oh--no one you know.  My sister has recommended several girls from\ntime to time.  I'll see.\"\n\nJane gave the freest and heartiest laugh that had passed her lips in\nmore than a year.  It was thus free and unrestrained because he had not\nsaid what she was fearing he would say--had not suggested the woman\nnearest him, the obvious woman.  So eager was she to discover what he\nthought of Selma, that she could hardly restrain herself from\nsuggesting her.  Before they could say anything more, two men came to\ntalk with him.  Jane could not but leave.\n\nShe dined that night at Mrs. Sherlock's--Mrs. Sherlock was Davy's\noldest sister.  Davy took her in, they talked--about his\ncareer--through dinner, and he walked home with her in the moonlight.\nHe was full of his approaching nomination.  He had been making what is\nknown as a good record, as mayor.  That is, he had struck out boldly at\nsundry petty abuses practised by a low and comparatively uninfluential\nclass of exploiters of the people.  He had been so busy with these\nshowy trifles that there had been no time for the large abuses.  True,\nhe had publicly warned the gas company about its poor gas, and the\nwater company about its unwholesome water for the low-lying tenement\ndistricts, and the traction company about the fewness and filthiness of\nits cars.  The gas company had talked of putting in improved machinery;\nthe water company had invited estimates on a filtration plant; the\ntraction company had said a vague something about new cars as soon as\ncar manufacturers could make definite promises as to delivery.  But\nnothing had been done--as yet. Obviously a corporation, a large\ninvestment of capital, must be treated with consideration.  It would\nnot do for a conservative, fair minded mayor to rush into demagogery.\nSo, Davy was content to point proudly to his record of having \"made the\nbig corporations awaken to a sense of their duty.\"  An excellent\nrecord, as good as a reform politician, with a larger career in\nprospect, could be expected to make.  People spoke well of Mayor Hull\nand the three daily papers eulogized him.  Davy no longer had qualms of\nconscience.  He read the eulogies, he listened to the flatteries of the\nconservative leading citizens he met at the Lincoln and at the\nUniversity, and he felt that he was all that he in young enthusiasm had\nset out to be.\n\nWhen he went to other cities and towns and to county fairs to make\naddresses he was introduced as the man who had redeemed Remsen City, as\na shining example of the honest SANE man in politics, as a man the\nbosses were afraid of, yet dared not try to down.  \"You can't fool the\npeople.\"  And were not the people, notably those who didn't live in\nRemsen City and had only read in their newspapers about the reform\nRepublican mayor--weren't they clamorous for Mayor Hull for governor!\nThus, Davy was high in his own esteem, was in that mood of profound\nresponsibility to righteousness and to the people wherein a man can get\nthe enthusiastic endorsement of his conscience for any act he deems it\nexpedient to commit in safeguarding and advancing his career.  His\nperson had become valuable to his country.  His opponents were\ntherefore anathema maranatha.\n\nAs he and Jane walked side by side in the tender moonlight, Jane said:\n\n\"What's become of Selma Gordon?\"\n\nA painful pause; then Davy, in a tone that secretly amused Jane:\n\"Selma?  I see her occasionally--at a distance.  She still writes for\nVictor Dorn's sheet, I believe.  I never see it.\"\n\nJane felt she could easily guess why.  \"Yes--it is irritating to read\ncriticisms of oneself,\" said she sweetly.  Davy's self-complacence had\nbeen most trying to her nerves.\n\nAnother long silence, then he said:  \"About--Miss Gordon.  I suppose\nyou were thinking of the things I confided to you last year?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was,\" confessed Jane.\n\n\"That's all over,\" said Mayor and prospective Governor Hull. \"I found I\nwas mistaken in her.\"\n\n\"Didn't you tell me that she refused you?\" pressed Jane, most unkindly.\n\n\"We met again after that,\" said Davy--by way of proving that even the\nmost devoted apostle of civic righteousness is yet not without his\nshare of the common humanity, \"and from that time I felt differently\ntoward her....  I've never been able to understand my folly....  I\nwonder if you could forgive me for it?\"\n\nDavy was a good deal of a bore, she felt.  At least, he seemed so in\nthis first renewing of old acquaintance.  But he was a man of purpose,\na man who was doing much and would do more.  And she liked him, and had\nfor him that feeling of sympathy and comprehension which exists among\npeople of the same region, brought up in much the same way.  Instead of\ncutting him off, she temporized.  Said she with a serenely careless\nlaugh that might have let a man more expert in the ways of women into\nthe secret of how little she cared about him:  \"You mean forgive you\nfor dropping me so abruptly and running after her?\"\n\n\"That's not exactly the way to put it,\" objected he.\n\n\"Put it any way you like,\" said Jane.  \"I forgive you.  I didn't care\nat the time, and I don't care now.\"\n\nJane was looking entrancing in that delicate light.  Davy was\nnoting--was feeling--this.  Also, he was reflecting--in a high-minded\nway--upon the many material, mental and spiritual advantages of a\nmarriage with her.  Just the woman to be a governor's wife--a senator's\nwife--a president's wife.  Said he:\n\n\"Jane, my feeling for you has never changed.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Jane.  \"Why, I thought you told me at one time that you\nwere in love with me?\"\n\n\"And I always have been, dear--and am,\" said Davy, in his deepest,\ntenderest tones.  \"And now that I am winning a position worthy of\nyou----\"\n\n\"I'll see,\" cut in Jane.  \"Let's not talk about it tonight.\" She felt\nthat if he kept on she might yield to the temptation to say something\nmocking, something she would regret if it drove him away finally.\n\nHe was content.  The ice had been broken.  The Selma Gordon business\nhad been disposed of.  The way was clear for straight-away love-making\nthe next time they met.  Meanwhile he would think about her, would get\nsteam up, would have his heart blazing and his words and phrases all in\nreadiness.\n\n\nEvery human being has his or her fundamental vanity that must be kept\nalive, if life is to be or to seem to be worth living.  In man this\nvanity is usually some form of belief in his mental ability, in woman\nsome form of belief in her physical charm. Fortunately--or, rather,\nnecessarily--not much is required to keep this vanity alive--or to\nrestore it after a shock, however severe.  Victor Dorn had been\ncompelled to give Jane Hastings' vanity no slight shock.  But it\nrecovered at once.  Jane saw that his failure to yield was due not to\nlack of potency in her charms, but to extraordinary strength of purpose\nin his character.  Thus, not only was she able to save herself from any\nsense of humiliation, but also she was without any feeling of\nresentment against him.  She liked him and admired him more than ever.\nShe saw his point of view; she admitted that he was right--IF it were\ngranted that a life such as he had mapped for himself was better for\nhim than the career he could have made with her help.\n\nHer heart, however, was hastily, even rudely thrust to the background\nwhen she discovered that her brother had been gambling in wheat with\npractically her entire fortune.  With an adroitness that irritated her\nagainst herself, as she looked back, he had continued to induce her to\ndisregard their father's cautionings and to ask him to take full charge\nof her affairs.  He had not lost her fortune, but he had almost lost\nit.  But for an accidental stroke, a week of weather destructive to\ncrops all over the country, she would have been reduced to an income of\nnot more than ten or fifteen thousand a year--twenty times the income\nof the average American family of five, but for Miss Hastings\nstraitened subsistence and a miserable state of shornness of all the\nradiance of life.  And, pushing her inquiries a little farther, she\nlearned that her brother would still have been rich, because he had\ntaken care to settle a large sum on his wife--in such a way that if she\ndivorced him it would pass back to him.\n\nIn the course of her arrangings to meet this situation and to prevent\nits recurrence she saw much of Doctor Charlton.  He gave her excellent\nadvice and found for her a man to take charge of her affairs so far as\nit was wise for her to trust any one.  The man was a bank cashier,\nRobert Headley by name--one of those rare beings who care nothing for\nriches for themselves and cannot invest their own money wisely, but\nhave a genius for fidelity and wise counsel.\n\n\"It's a pity he's married,\" said Charlton.  \"If he weren't I'd urge you\nto take him as a husband.\"\n\nJane laughed.  A plainer, duller man than Headley it would have been\nhard to find, even among the respectabilities of Remsen City.\n\n\"Why do you laugh?\" said Charlton.  \"What is there absurd in a sensible\nmarriage?\"\n\n\"Would you marry a woman because she was a good housekeeper?\"\n\n\"That would be one of the requirements,\" said Charlton.  \"I've sense\nenough to know that, no matter how much I liked a woman before\nmarriage, it couldn't last long if she were incompetent. She'd irritate\nme every moment in the day.  I'd lie awake of nights despising her.\nAnd how she would hate me!\"\n\n\"I can't imagine you a husband,\" laughed Jane.\n\n\"That doesn't speak well for your imagination,\" rejoined Charlton.  \"I\nhave perfect health--which means that I have a perfect disposition, for\nonly people with deranged interiors are sour and snappy and moody.  And\nI am sympathetic and understanding.  I appreciate that women are\nrottenly brought up and have everything to learn--everything that's\nworth while if one is to live comfortably and growingly.  So, I\nshouldn't expect much at the outset beyond a desire to improve and a\ncapacity to improve.  Yes, I've about all the virtues for a model\nhusband--a companionable, helpful mate for a woman who wants to be more\nof a person every day she lives.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Jane, mockingly.  \"The advertisement reads well, but\nI don't care to invest.\"\n\n\"Oh, I looked you over long ago,\" said Charlton with a coolness that\nboth amused and exasperated her.  \"You wouldn't do at all. You are very\nattractive to look at and to talk with.  Your money would be useful to\nsome plans I've got for some big sanatoriums along the line of\nSchulze's up at Saint Christopher.  But---\" He shook his head, smiling\nat her through a cloud of cigarette smoke.\n\n\"Go on,\" urged Jane.  \"What's wrong with me?\"\n\n\"You've been miseducated too far and too deeply.  You KNOW too much\nthat isn't so.  You've got the upper class American woman habit of\nthinking about yourself all the time.  You are an indifferent\nhousekeeper, and you think you are good at it.  You don't know the\npractical side of life--cooking, sewing, house furnishing, marketing.\nYou're ambitious for a show career--the sort Davy Hull--excuse me,\nGovernor David Hull--is making so noisily.  There's just the man for\nyou.  You ought to marry. Marry Hull.\"\n\nJane was furiously angry.  She did not dare show it; Charlton would\nmerely laugh and walk away, and perhaps refuse to be friends with her.\nIt exasperated her to the core, the narrow limitations of the power of\nmoney.  She could, through the power of her money, do exactly as she\npleased to and with everybody except the only kind of people she cared\nabout dominating; these she was apparently the less potent with\nbecause of her money. It seemed to put them on their mettle and on\ntheir guard.\n\nShe swallowed her anger.  \"Yes, I've got to get married,\" said she.\n\"And I don't know what to do about it.\"\n\n\"Hull,\" said Charlton.\n\n\"Is that the best advice you can give?\" said she disdainfully.\n\n\"He needs you, and you need him.  You like him--don't you?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Then--the thing's done.  Davy isn't the man to fail to seize an\nopportunity so obviously to his advantage.  Not that he hasn't a heart.\nHe has a big one--does all sorts of gracious, patronizing, kind\nthings--does no end of harm.  But he'd no more let his emotions rule\nhis life than--than--Victor Dorn--or I, for that matter.\"\n\nJane colored; a pathetic sadness tinged the far-away expression of her\neyes.\n\n\"No doubt he's half in love with you already.  Most men are who know\nyou.  A kindly smile and he'll be kneeling.\"\n\n\"I don't want David Hull,\" cried Jane.  \"Ever since I can remember\nthey've been at me to marry him.  He bores me.  He doesn't make me\nrespect him.  He never could control me--or teach me--or make me look\nup to him in any way.  I don't want him, and I won't have him.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you've got to do it,\" said Charlton.  \"You act as if you\nrealized it and were struggling and screaming against manifest destiny\nlike a child against a determined mother.\"\n\nJane's eyes had a look of terror.  \"You are joking,\" said she. \"But it\nfrightens me, just the same.\"\n\n\"I am not joking,\" replied he.  \"I can hear the wedding bells--and so\ncan you.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" pleaded Jane.  \"I've so much confidence in your insight that I\ncan't bear to hear you saying such things even to tease me....  Why\nhaven't you told me about these sanatoriums you want?\"\n\n\"Because I've been hoping I could devise some way of getting them\nwithout the use of money.  Did it ever occur to you that almost nothing\nthat's been of real and permanent value to the world was built with\nmoney?  The things that money has done have always been badly done.\"\n\n\"Let me help you,\" said Jane earnestly.  \"Give me something to do.\nTeach me how to do something.  I am SO bored!--and so eager to have an\noccupation.  I simply can't lead the life of my class.\n\n\"You want to be a lady patroness--a lady philanthropist,\" said\nCharlton, not greatly impressed by her despair.  \"That's only another\nform of the life of your class--and a most offensive form.\"\n\n\"Your own terms--your own terms, absolutely,\" cried Jane in desperation.\n\n\"No--marry Hull and go into upper and middle class politics. You'll be\na lady senator or a lady ambassador or cabinet officer, at least.\"\n\n\"I will not marry David Hull--or anybody, just yet,\" cried Jane.  \"Why\nshould I?  I've still got ten years where there's a chance of my being\nable to attract some man who--attracts me. And after that I can buy as\ngood a husband as any that offers now.  Doctor Charlton, I'm in\ndesperate, deadly earnest.  And I ask you to help me.\"\n\n\"My own terms?\"\n\n\"I give you my word.\"\n\n\"You'll have to give your money outright.  No strings attached. No\nchance to be a philanthropist.  Also, you'll have to work--have to\neducate yourself as I instruct you.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.  Whatever you say.\"\n\nCharlton looked at her dubiously.  \"I'm a fool to have anything to do\nwith this,\" he said.  \"You aren't in any way a suitable person--any\nmore than I'm the sort of man you want to assist you in your schemes.\nYou don't realize what tests you're to be put through.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Jane.\n\n\"It's a chance to try my theory,\" mused he.  \"You know, I insist we are\nall absolutely the creatures of circumstance--that character adapts\nitself to circumstance--that to change a man or a town or a nation--or\na world--you have only to change their fundamental circumstances.\"\n\n\"You'll try me?\"\n\n\"I'll think about it,\" said Charlton.  \"I'll talk with Victor Dorn\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, don't talk to him,\" cried Jane, in terror. \"He has no\nfaith in me--\"  She checked herself, hastily added--\"in anybody outside\nhis own class.\"\n\n\"I never do anything serious without consulting Victor,\" said Charlton\nfirmly.  \"He's got the best mind of any one I know, and it is foolish\nto act without taking counsel of the best.\"\n\n\"He'll advise against it,\" said Jane bitterly.\n\n\"But I may not take his advice literally,\" said Charlton. \"I'm not in\nmental slavery to him.  I often adapt his advice to my needs instead of\nadopting it outright.\"\n\nAnd with that she had to be content.\n\nShe passed a day and night of restlessness, and called him on the\ntelephone early the following morning.  As she heard his voice she said:\n\n\"Did you see Victor Dorn last night?\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" asked Charlton.\n\n\"In my room,\" was her impatient answer.\n\n\"In bed?\"\n\n\"I haven't gotten up yet,\" said she.  \"What IS the matter?\"\n\n\"Had your breakfast?\"\n\n\"No.  I've rung for it.  It'll be here in a few minutes.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Charlton.\n\n\"This is very mysterious--or very absurd,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Please ring off and call your kitchen and tell them to put your\nbreakfast on the dining-room table for you in three-quarters of an\nhour.  Then get up, take your bath and your exercises--dress yourself\nfor the day--and go down and eat your breakfast.  How can you hope to\namount to anything unless you live by a rational system?  And how can\nyou have a rational system unless you begin the day right?\"\n\n\"DID you see Victor Dorn?\" said Jane--furious at his impertinence but\nrestraining herself.\n\n\"And after you have breakfasted,\" continued Charlton, \"call me up\nagain, and I'll answer your questions.\"\n\nWith that he hung up his receiver.  Jane threw herself angrily back\nagainst her pillow.  She would lie there for an hour, then call him\nagain.  But--if he should ask her whether she had obeyed his orders?\nTrue, she might lie to him; but wouldn't that be too petty?  She\ndebated with herself for a few minutes, then obeyed him to the letter.\nAs she was coming through the front hall after breakfast, he appeared\nin the doorway.\n\n\"You didn't trust me!\" she cried reproachfully.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied he.  \"But I preferred to talk with you face to face.\"\n\n\"DID you see Mr. Dorn?\"\n\nCharlton nodded.  \"He refused to advise me.  He said he had a personal\nprejudice in your favor that would make his advice worthless.\"\n\nJane glowed--but not quite so thrillingly as she would have glowed in\nthe same circumstances a year before.\n\n\"Besides, he's in no state of mind to advise anybody about anything\njust now,\" said Charlton.\n\nJane glanced sharply at him.  \"What do you mean?\" she said.\n\n\"It's not my secret,\" replied Charlton.\n\n\"You mean he has fallen in love?\"\n\n\"That's shrewd,\" said Charlton.  \"But women always assume a love\naffair.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" persisted Jane.\n\n\"Oh, a very nice girl.  No matter.  I'm not here to talk about\nanybody's affairs but yours--and mine.\"\n\n\"Answer just one question,\" said Jane, impulsively.  \"Did he tell you\nanything about--me?\"\n\nCharlton stared--then whistled.  \"Are YOU in love with him, too?\" he\ncried.\n\nJane flushed--hesitated--then met his glance frankly.  \"I WAS,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"WAS?\"\n\n\"I mean that I'm over it,\" said she.  \"What have you decided to do\nabout me?\"\n\nCharlton did not answer immediately.  He eyed her narrowly--an\nexamination which she withstood well.  Then he glanced away and seemed\nto be reflecting.  Finally he came back to her question. Said he:\n\n\"To give you a trial.  To find out whether you'll do.\"\n\nShe drew a long sigh of relief.\n\n\"Didn't you guess?\" he went on, smilingly, nodding his round,\nprize-fighter head at her.  \"Those suggestions about bed and\nbreakfast--they were by way of a beginning.\"\n\n\"You must give me a lot to do,\" urged she.  \"I mustn't have a minute of\nidle time.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"Trust me,\" he said.\n\n\nWhile Jane was rescuing her property from her brother and was\nsafeguarding it against future attempts by him, or by any of that\nnumerous company whose eyes are ever roving in search of the most\ninviting of prey, the lone women with baggage--while Jane was thus\noccupied, David Hull was, if possible, even busier and more absorbed.\nHe was being elected governor.  His State was being got ready to say to\nthe mayor of Remsen City, \"Well done, good and faithful servant.  Thou\nhast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many.\"\n\nThe nomination was not obtained for him without difficulty.  The\nRepublican party--like the Democratic--had just been brought back under\n\"safe and sane and conservative\" leadership after a prolonged debauch\nunder the influence of that once famous and revered reformer, Aaron\nWhitman, who had not sobered up or released the party for its sobering\nuntil his wife's extravagant entertaining at Washington had forced him\nto accept large \"retainers\" from the plutocracy.  The machine leaders\nhad in the beginning forwarded the ambitions of Whitman under the\nimpression that his talk of a \"square deal\" was \"just the usual dope\"\nand that Aaron was a \"level-headed fellow at bottom.\"  It had\ndeveloped--after they had let Aaron become a popular idol, not to be\ntrifled with--it had developed that he was almost sincere--as sincere\nas can be expected of an ambitious, pushing fellow.  Now came David\nHull, looking suspiciously like Whitman at his worst-and a more\nhopeless case, because he had money a plenty, while Whitman was luckily\npoor and blessed with an extravagant wife.  True, Hull had the backing\nof Dick Kelly--and Kelly was not the man \"to hand the boys a lemon.\"\nStill Hull looked like a \"holy boy,\" talked like one, had the popular\nreputation of having acted like one as mayor--and the \"reform game\" was\ncertainly one to attract a man who could afford it and was in politics\nfor position only.  Perhaps Dick wanted to be rid of Hull for the rest\nof his term, and was \"kicking him upstairs.\"  It would be a shabby\ntrick upon his fellow leaders, but justifiable if there should be some\nbig \"job\" at Remsen City that could be \"pulled off\" only if Hull were\nout of the way.\n\nThe leaders were cold until Dick got his masters in the Remsen City\nbranch of the plutocracy to pass the word to the plutocracy's general\nagents at Indianapolis--a certain well-known firm of political bankers.\nUntil that certification came the leaders, having no candidate who\nstood a chance of winning, were ready to make a losing campaign and\nthrow the election to the Democrats--not a serious misfortune at a time\nwhen the machines of the two parties had become simply friendly rival\nagents for the same rich master.\n\nThere was a sharp fight in the convention.  The anti-machine element,\nrepudiating Whitman under the leadership of a shrewd and honest young\nman named Joe Bannister, had attacked Hull in the most shocking way.\nBannister had been reading Victor Dorn's New Day and had got a notion\nof David Hull as man and mayor different from the one made current by\nthe newspapers.  He made a speech on the floor of the convention which\nalmost caused a riot and nearly cost Davy the nomination.  That\ncatastrophe was averted by adjournment.  Davy gave Dick Kelly's second\nlieutenant, Osterman, ten thousand in cash, of which Osterman said\nthere was pressing need \"for perfectly legitimate purposes, I assure\nyou, Mr. Mayor.\"  Next day the Bannister faction lost forty and odd\nsturdy yeomen from districts where the crops had been painfully short,\nand Davy was nominated.\n\nIn due time the election was held, and Mayor Hull became Governor Hull\nby a satisfactory majority for so evenly divided a State. He had\nspent--in contributions to the machine campaign fund--upwards of one\nhundred thousand dollars.  But that seemed a trifling sacrifice to make\nfor reform principles and for keeping the voice of the people the voice\nof God.  He would have been elected if he had not spent a cent, for the\nDemocratic machine, bent on reorganizing back to a sound basis with all\nreal reformers or reformers tainted with sincerity eliminated, had\nnominated a straight machine man--and even the politicians know that\nthe people who decide elections will not elect a machine man if they\nhave a chance to vote for any one else.  It saddened David Hull, in the\nmidst of victory, that his own town and county went against him,\npreferring the Democrat, whom it did not know, as he lived at the other\nend of the State.  Locally the offices at stake were all captured by\nthe \"Dorn crowd.\"  At last the Workingmen's League had a judge; at last\nit could have a day in court.  There would not be a repetition of the\ngreat frauds of the Hull-Harbinger campaign.\n\nBy the time David had sufficient leisure to reopen the heart department\nof his ambition, Jane was deep in the effort to show Doctor Charlton\nhow much intelligence and character she had.  She was serving an\napprenticeship as trained nurse in the Children's Hospital, where he\nwas chief of the staff, and was taking several extra courses with his\nyoung assistants.  It was nearly two weeks after David's first attempt\nto see her when her engagements and his at last permitted this meeting.\nSaid he:\n\n\"What's this new freak?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you yet,\" replied she.  \"I'm not sure, myself.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you can endure that fellow Charlton.  They say he's as\nbig a crank in medicine as he is in politics.\"\n\n\"It's all of a piece,\" said Jane, tranquilly.  \"He says he gets his\npolitical views from his medicine and his medical ideas from his\npolitics.\"\n\n\"Don't you think he's a frightful bounder?\"\n\n\"Frightful,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Fresh, impudent--conceited.  And he looks like a prize fighter.\"\n\n\"At some angles--yes,\" conceded Jane.  \"At others, he's almost\nhandsome.\"\n\n\"The other day, when I called at the hospital and they wouldn't take my\nname in to you--\"  David broke off to vent his indignation--\"Did you\never hear of such impertinence!\"\n\n\"And you the governor-elect,\" laughed Jane.  \"Shall I tell you what\nDoctor Charlton said?  He said that a governor was simply a public\nservant, and anything but a public representative--usually a public\ndisgrace.  He said that a servant's business was attending to his own\njob and not hanging round preventing his fellow servants from attending\nto their jobs.\"\n\n\"I knew he had low and vulgar views of public affairs,\" said David.\n\"What I started to say was that I saw him talking to you that day,\nacross the court, and you seemed to be enjoying his conversation.\"\n\n\n\"ENJOYING it?  I love it,\" cried Jane.  \"He makes me laugh, he makes me\ncold with rage, he gives me a different sensation every time I see him.\"\n\n\"You LIKE--him?\"\n\n\"Immensely.  And I've never been so interested or so happy in my life.\"\nShe looked steadily at him.  \"Nothing could induce me to give it up.\nI've put everything else out of my mind.\"\n\nSince the dismal end of his adventure with Selma Gordon, David had\nbecome extremely wary in his dealings with the female sex. He never\nagain would invite a refusal; he never again would put himself in a\nposition where a woman might feel free to tell him her private opinion\nof him.  He reflected upon Jane's words. They could have but the one\nmeaning.  Not so calmly as he would have liked, but without any\nembarrassing constraint, he said:\n\n\"I'm glad you've found what suits you, at last.  It isn't exactly the\nline I'd have thought a girl such as you would choose.  You're sure you\nare not making a mistake?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Jane.\n\n\"I should think you'd prefer marriage--and a home--and a social\ncircle--and all that,\" ventured David.\n\n\"I'll probably not marry.\"\n\n\"No.  You'd hardly take a doctor.\"\n\n\"The only one I'd want I can't get,\" said Jane.\n\nShe wished to shock David, and she saw with pleasure that she had\nsucceeded.  Indeed so shocked was he that in a few minutes he took\nleave.  And as he passed from her sight he passed from her mind.\n\n\nVictor Dorn described Davy Hull's inaugural address as \"an\nuninteresting sample of the standard reform brand of artificial milk\nfor political infants.\"  The press, however, was enthusiastic, and\nsubstantial people everywhere spoke of it as having the \"right ring,\"\nas being the utterance of a \"safe, clean man whom the politicians can't\nfrighten or fool.\"  In this famous speech David urged everybody who was\ndoing right to keep on doing so, warned everybody who was doing wrong\nthat they would better look out for themselves, praised those who were\ntrying to better conditions in the right way, condemned those who were\ntrying to do so in the wrong way.  It was all most eloquent, most\nearnest.  Some few people were disappointed that he had not explained\nexactly what and whom he meant by right and by wrong; but these carping\nmurmurs were drowned in the general acclaim.  A man whose fists\nclenched and whose eyes flashed as did David Hull's must \"mean\nbusiness\"--and if no results came of these words, it wouldn't be his\nfault, but the machinations of wicked plutocrats and their political\nagents.\n\n\"Isn't it disgusting!\" exclaimed Selma, reading an impassioned\nparagraph aloud to Victor Dorn.  \"It almost makes me despair when I see\nhow people--our sort of people, too--are taken in by such guff.  And\nthey stand with their empty picked pockets and cheer this man, who's\nnothing but a stool pigeon for pickpockets.\"\n\n\"It's something gained,\" observed Victor tranquilly, \"when politicians\nhave to denounce the plutocracy in order to get audiences and offices.\nThe people are beginning to know what's wrong.  They read into our\nfriend Hull's generalities what they think he ought to mean--what they\nbelieve he does mean.  The next step is--he'll have to do something or\nthey'll find him out.\"\n\n\"He do anything?\" Selma laughed derisively.  \"He hasn't the courage--or\nthe honesty.\"\n\n\"Well--'patience and shuffle the cards,' as Sancho Panza says. We're\nwinning Remsen City.  And our friends are winning a little ground here,\nand a little there and a little yonder--and soon--only too soon--this\ncrumbling false politics will collapse and disappear.  Too soon, I\nfear.  Before the new politics of a work-compelling world for the\nworking class only is ready to be installed.\"\n\nSelma had been only half attending.  She now said abruptly, with a\nfluttering movement that suggested wind blowing strongly across open\nprairies under a bright sky:\n\n\"I've decided to go away.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must take a vacation,\" said Victor.  \"I've been telling you\nthat for several years.  And you must go away to the sea or the\nmountains where you'll not be harassed by the fate of the human race\nthat you so take to heart.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean a vacation,\" said Selma.  \"I meant to Chicago--to work\nthere.\"\n\n\"You've had a good offer?\" said Victor.  \"I knew it would come.  You've\ngot to take it.  You need the wider experience--the chance to have a\npaper of your own--or a work of your own of some kind.  It's been\nselfishness, my keeping you all this time.\"\n\nSelma had turned away.  With her face hidden from him she said, \"Yes, I\nmust go.\"\n\n\"When?\" said Victor.\n\n\"As soon as you can arrange for some one else.\"\n\n\"All right.  I'll look round.  I've no hope of finding any one to take\nyour place, but I can get some one who will do.\"\n\n\"You can train any one,\" said Selma.  \"Just as you trained me.\"\n\n\"I'll see what's to be done,\" was all he said.\n\nA week passed--two weeks.  She waited; he did not bring up the subject.\nBut she knew he was thinking of it; for there had been a change in his\nmanner toward her--a constraint, a self-consciousness theretofore\nutterly foreign to him in his relations with any one.  Selma was\nwretched, and began to show it first in her appearance, then in her\nwork.  At last she burst out:\n\n\"Give that article back to me,\" she cried.  \"It's rotten.  I can't\nwrite any more.  Why don't you tell me so frankly?  Why don't you send\nme away?\"\n\n\"You're doing better work than I am,\" said he.  \"You're eager to be\noff--aren't you?  Will you stay a few days longer?  I must get away to\nthe country--alone--to get a fresh grip on myself. I'll come back as\nsoon as I can, and you'll be free.  There'll be no chance for vacations\nafter you're gone.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said she.  She felt that he would think this curtness\nungracious, but more she could not say.\n\nHe was gone four days.  When he reappeared at the office he was\nbronzed, but under the bronze showed fatigue--in a man of his youth and\nstrength sure sign of much worry and loss of sleep.  He greeted her\nalmost awkwardly, his eyes avoiding hers, and sat down to opening his\naccumulated mail.  Although she was furtively observing him she started\nwhen he abruptly said:\n\n\"You know you are free to go--at any time.\"\n\n\"I'll wait until you catch up with your work,\" she suggested.\n\n\"No--never mind.  I'll get along.  I've kept you out of all reason....\nThe sooner you go the better.  I've got to get used to it, and--I hate\nsuspense.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go in the morning,\" said Selma.  \"I've no arrangements to\nmake--except a little packing that'll take less than an hour.  Will you\nsay good-by for me to any one who asks? I hate fusses, and I'll be back\nhere from time to time.\"\n\nHe looked at her curiously, started to speak, changed his mind and\nresumed reading the letter in his hand.  She turned to her work, sat\npretending to write.  In fact she was simply scribbling.  Her eyes were\nburning and she was fighting against the sobs that came surging.  He\nrose and began to walk up and down the room.  She hastily crumpled and\nflung away the sheet on which she had be scrawling; he might happen to\nglance at her desk and see.  She bent closer to the paper and began to\nwrite--anything that came into her head.  Presently the sound of his\nstep ceased.  An uncontrollable impulse to fly seized her. She would\nget up--would not put on her hat--would act as if she were simply going\nto the street door for a moment.  And she would not return--would\nescape the danger of a silly breakdown.  She summoned all her courage,\nsuddenly rose and moved swiftly toward the door.  At the threshold she\nhad to pause; she could not control her heart from a last look at him.\n\nHe was seated at his table, was staring at its litter of letters,\npapers and manuscripts with an expression so sad that it completely\ntransformed him.  She forgot herself.  She said softly:\n\n\"Victor!\"\n\nHe did not hear.\n\n\"Victor,\" she repeated a little more loudly.\n\nHe roused himself, glanced at her with an attempt at his usual friendly\nsmile of the eyes.\n\n\"Is there something wrong that you haven't told me about?\" she asked.\n\n\"It'll pass,\" said he.  \"I'll get used to it.\"  With an attempt at the\nmanner of the humorous philosopher, \"Man is the most adaptable of all\nthe animals.  That's why he has distanced all his relations.  I didn't\nrealize how much our association meant to me until you set me to\nthinking about it by telling me you were going.  I had been taking you\nfor granted--a habit we easily fall into with those who simply work\nwith and for us and don't insist upon themselves.\"\n\nShe was leaning against the frame of the open door into the hall, her\nhands behind her back.  She was gazing out of the window across the\nroom.\n\n\"You,\" he went on, \"are as I'd like to be--as I imagined I was.  Your\nsense of duty to the cause orders you elsewhere, and you go--like a\ngood soldier, with never a backward glance.\"\n\nShe shook her head, but did not speak.\n\n\"With never a backward glance,\" he repeated.  \"While I--\"  He shut his\nlips together firmly and settled himself with fierce resolution to his\nwork.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he said.  \"This is--cowardly.  As I said\nbefore, I shall get myself in hand again, and go on.\"\n\nShe did not move.  The breeze of the unseasonably warm and brilliant\nday fluttered her thick, loosely gathered hair about her brow.  Her\nstrange, barbaric little face suggested that the wind was blowing\nacross it a throng of emotions like the clouds of a driven storm.\n\nA long silence.  He suddenly flung out his arms in a despairing gesture\nand let them fall to the table.  At the crash she startled, gazed\nwildly about.\n\n\"Selma!\" he cried.  \"I must say it.  I love you.\"\n\nA profound silence fell.  After a while she went softly across the room\nand sat down at her desk.\n\n\"I think I've loved you from the first months of your coming here to\nwork--to the old office, I mean.  But we were always together--every\nday--all day long--working together--I thinking and doing nothing\nwithout your sharing in it.  So, I never realized.  Don't\nmisunderstand.  I'm not trying to keep you here. It's simply that I've\ngot the habit of telling you everything--of holding back nothing from\nyou.\"\n\n\"I was going,\" she said, \"because I loved you.\"\n\nHe looked at her in amazement.\n\n\"That day you told me you had decided to get married--and asked my\nadvice about the girls among our friends--that was the day I began to\nfeel I'd have to go.  It's been getting worse ever since.\"\n\nOnce more silence, both looking uneasily about, their glances avoiding\neach other.  The door of the printing room opened, and Holman, the\nprinter, came in, his case in his grimy hand.  Said he:\n\n\"Where's the rest of that street car article?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Selma, starting up and taking some manuscript\nfrom her desk and handing it to him.\n\n\"Louis,\" said Victor, as Holmes was retreating, \"Selma and I are going\nto be married.\"\n\nLouis paused, but did not look round.  \"That ain't what'd be called\nnews,\" said he.  \"I've known it for more than three years.\"\n\nHe moved on toward his room.  \"I'll be ready for that leading article\nin half an hour.  So, you'd better get busy.\"\n\nHe went out, closing the door behind him.  Selma and Victor looked at\neach other and burst out laughing.  Then--still laughing--they took\nhold of hands like two children.  And the next thing they knew they\nwere tight in each other's arms, and Selma was sobbing wildly.\n\n\n\nX\n\nWhen Jane had finished her apprenticeship, Doctor Charlton asked her to\nmarry him.  Said Jane:\n\n\"I never knew you to be commonplace before.  I've felt this coming for\nsome time, but I expected it would be in the form of an offer to marry\nme.\"\n\nShe promptly accepted him--and she has not, and will not regret it.  So\nfar as a single case can prove a theory, Jane's case has proved\nCharlton's theory that environment determines character. His\nalternations of tenderness and brusqueness, of devotion to her and\ndevotion to his work, his constant offering of something new and his\nunremitting insistence upon something new from her each day make it\nimpossible for her to develop the slightest tendency toward that\nsleeping sickness wherewith the germ of conventionality inflicts any\nmind it seizes upon.\n\nDavid Hull, now temporarily in eclipse through over caution in radical\nutterance, is gathering himself for a fresh spurt that will doubtless\nplace him at the front in politics again.  He has never married.  The\nbelief in Remsen City is that he is a victim of disappointed love for\nJane Hastings.  But the truth is that he is unable to take his mind off\nhimself long enough to be come sufficiently interested in another human\nbeing.  There is no especial reason why he has thus far escaped the\nmany snares that have been set for him because of his wealth and\nposition.  Who can account for the vagaries of chance?\n\nThe Workingmen's League now controls the government of Remsen City.  It\ngives an honest and efficient administration, and keeps the public\nservice corporations as respectful of the people as the laws will\npermit.  But, as Victor Dorn always warned the people, little can be\ndone until the State government is conquered--and even then there will\nbe the national government to see that all the wrongs of vested rights\nare respected and that the people shall have little to say, in the\nmanagement of their own affairs.  As all sensible people know, any\ncorrupt politician, or any greedy plutocrat, or any agent of either is\na safer and better administrator of the people's affairs than the\npeople themselves.\n\nThe New Day is a daily with a circulation for its weekly edition that\nis national.  And Victor and Selma are still its editors, though they\nhave two little boys to bring up.\n\nJane and Selma see a great deal of each other, and are friendly, and\ntry hard to like each other.  But they are not friends.\n\nDick Kelly's oldest son, graduated from Harvard, is the leader of the\nRemsen City fashionable set.  Joe House's only son is a professional\ngambler and sets the pace among the sports."
