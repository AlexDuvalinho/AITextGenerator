Chesterton\n\n                  Contents\n\n\n                  The Blue Cross\n                  The Secret Garden\n                  The Queer Feet\n                  The Flying Stars\n                  The Invisible Man\n                  The Honour of Israel Gow\n                  The Wrong Shape\n                  The Sins of Prince Saradine\n                  The Hammer of God\n                  The Eye of Apollo\n                  The Sign of the Broken Sword\n                  The Three Tools of Death\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blue Cross\n\nBetween the silver ribbon of morning and the green glittering ribbon of\nsea, the boat touched Harwich and let loose a swarm of folk like flies,\namong whom the man we must follow was by no means conspicuous--nor\nwished to be. There was nothing notable about him, except a slight\ncontrast between the holiday gaiety of his clothes and the official\ngravity of his face. His clothes included a slight, pale grey jacket,\na white waistcoat, and a silver straw hat with a grey-blue ribbon. His\nlean face was dark by contrast, and ended in a curt black beard that\nlooked Spanish and suggested an Elizabethan ruff. He was smoking a\ncigarette with the seriousness of an idler. There was nothing about him\nto indicate the fact that the grey jacket covered a loaded revolver,\nthat the white waistcoat covered a police card, or that the straw hat\ncovered one of the most powerful intellects in Europe. For this was\nValentin himself, the head of the Paris police and the most famous\ninvestigator of the world; and he was coming from Brussels to London to\nmake the greatest arrest of the century.\n\nFlambeau was in England. The police of three countries had tracked the\ngreat criminal at last from Ghent to Brussels, from Brussels to the Hook\nof Holland; and it was conjectured that he would take some advantage of\nthe unfamiliarity and confusion of the Eucharistic Congress, then\ntaking place in London. Probably he would travel as some minor clerk\nor secretary connected with it; but, of course, Valentin could not be\ncertain; nobody could be certain about Flambeau.\n\nIt is many years now since this colossus of crime suddenly ceased\nkeeping the world in a turmoil; and when he ceased, as they said after\nthe death of Roland, there was a great quiet upon the earth. But in\nhis best days (I mean, of course, his worst) Flambeau was a figure as\nstatuesque and international as the Kaiser. Almost every morning the\ndaily paper announced that he had escaped the consequences of one\nextraordinary crime by committing another. He was a Gascon of gigantic\nstature and bodily daring; and the wildest tales were told of his\noutbursts of athletic humour; how he turned the juge d’instruction\nupside down and stood him on his head, “to clear his mind”; how he ran\ndown the Rue de Rivoli with a policeman under each arm. It is due to him\nto say that his fantastic physical strength was generally employed in\nsuch bloodless though undignified scenes; his real crimes were chiefly\nthose of ingenious and wholesale robbery. But each of his thefts was\nalmost a new sin, and would make a story by itself. It was he who ran\nthe great Tyrolean Dairy Company in London, with no dairies, no cows, no\ncarts, no milk, but with some thousand subscribers. These he served by\nthe simple operation of moving the little milk cans outside people’s\ndoors to the doors of his own customers. It was he who had kept up an\nunaccountable and close correspondence with a young lady whose whole\nletter-bag was intercepted, by the extraordinary trick of photographing\nhis messages infinitesimally small upon the slides of a microscope. A\nsweeping simplicity, however, marked many of his experiments. It is said\nthat he once repainted all the numbers in a street in the dead of night\nmerely to divert one traveller into a trap. It is quite certain that\nhe invented a portable pillar-box, which he put up at corners in quiet\nsuburbs on the chance of strangers dropping postal orders into it.\nLastly, he was known to be a startling acrobat; despite his huge figure,\nhe could leap like a grasshopper and melt into the tree-tops like a\nmonkey. Hence the great Valentin, when he set out to find Flambeau, was\nperfectly aware that his adventures would not end when he had found him.\n\nBut how was he to find him? On this the great Valentin’s ideas were\nstill in process of settlement.\n\nThere was one thing which Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise,\ncould not cover, and that was his singular height. If Valentin’s quick\neye had caught a tall apple-woman, a tall grenadier, or even a tolerably\ntall duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. But all along his\ntrain there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than\na cat could be a disguised giraffe. About the people on the boat he had\nalready satisfied himself; and the people picked up at Harwich or on\nthe journey limited themselves with certainty to six. There was a short\nrailway official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short\nmarket gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow\nlady going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic\npriest going up from a small Essex village. When it came to the last\ncase, Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. The little priest was so\nmuch the essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull\nas a Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had\nseveral brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting.\nThe Eucharistic Congress had doubtless sucked out of their local\nstagnation many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles\ndisinterred. Valentin was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and\ncould have no love for priests. But he could have pity for them, and\nthis one might have provoked pity in anybody. He had a large, shabby\numbrella, which constantly fell on the floor. He did not seem to know\nwhich was the right end of his return ticket. He explained with a\nmoon-calf simplicity to everybody in the carriage that he had to be\ncareful, because he had something made of real silver “with blue stones”\n in one of his brown-paper parcels. His quaint blending of Essex flatness\nwith saintly simplicity continuously amused the Frenchman till the\npriest arrived (somehow) at Tottenham with all his parcels, and came\nback for his umbrella. When he did the last, Valentin even had the good\nnature to warn him not to take care of the silver by telling everybody\nabout it. But to whomever he talked, Valentin kept his eye open for\nsomeone else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or poor, male or\nfemale, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four inches above\nit.\n\nHe alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure\nthat he had not missed the criminal so far. He then went to Scotland\nYard to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he\nthen lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of\nLondon. As he was walking in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he\npaused suddenly and stood. It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical\nof London, full of an accidental stillness. The tall, flat houses round\nlooked at once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrubbery in\nthe centre looked as deserted as a green Pacific islet. One of the four\nsides was much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this\nside was broken by one of London’s admirable accidents--a restaurant\nthat looked as if it had strayed from Soho. It was an unreasonably\nattractive object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of\nlemon yellow and white. It stood specially high above the street, and in\nthe usual patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street\nran up to meet the front door almost as a fire-escape might run up to\na first-floor window. Valentin stood and smoked in front of the\nyellow-white blinds and considered them long.\n\nThe most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. A few\nclouds in heaven do come together into the staring shape of one human\neye. A tree does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the\nexact and elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. I have seen both\nthese things myself within the last few days. Nelson does die in the\ninstant of victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally\nmurder a man named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide.\nIn short, there is in life an element of elfin coincidence which people\nreckoning on the prosaic may perpetually miss. As it has been well\nexpressed in the paradox of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen.\n\nAristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence\nis intelligence specially and solely. He was not “a thinking machine”;\nfor that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. A\nmachine only is a machine because it cannot think. But he was a thinking\nman, and a plain man at the same time. All his wonderful successes, that\nlooked like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear\nand commonplace French thought. The French electrify the world not by\nstarting any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. They\ncarry a truism so far--as in the French Revolution. But exactly because\nValentin understood reason, he understood the limits of reason. Only a\nman who knows nothing of motors talks of motoring without petrol; only\na man who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong,\nundisputed first principles. Here he had no strong first principles.\nFlambeau had been missed at Harwich; and if he was in London at all,\nhe might be anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall\ntoast-master at the Hotel Metropole. In such a naked state of nescience,\nValentin had a view and a method of his own.\n\nIn such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen. In such cases, when he\ncould not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully\nfollowed the train of the unreasonable. Instead of going to the right\nplaces--banks, police stations, rendezvous--he systematically went to\nthe wrong places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de\nsac, went up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent\nthat led him uselessly out of the way. He defended this crazy course\nquite logically. He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way;\nbut if one had no clue at all it was the best, because there was just\nthe chance that any oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be\nthe same that had caught the eye of the pursued. Somewhere a man must\nbegin, and it had better be just where another man might stop. Something\nabout that flight of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude\nand quaintness of the restaurant, roused all the detective’s rare\nromantic fancy and made him resolve to strike at random. He went up the\nsteps, and sitting down at a table by the window, asked for a cup of\nblack coffee.\n\nIt was half-way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the\nslight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind\nhim of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he proceeded\nmusingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the\ntime about Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a\npair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to\npay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through\na telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his\ndetective brain as good as the criminal’s, which was true. But he fully\nrealised the disadvantage. “The criminal is the creative artist; the\ndetective only the critic,” he said with a sour smile, and lifted his\ncoffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put\nsalt in it.\n\nHe looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it\nwas certainly a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a\nchampagne-bottle for champagne. He wondered why they should keep salt in\nit. He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there\nwere two salt-cellars quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in\nthe condiment in the salt-cellars. He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he\nlooked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see\nif there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which\nputs the sugar in the salt-cellars and the salt in the sugar-basin.\nExcept for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered\nwalls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the\nbell for the waiter.\n\nWhen that official hurried up, fuzzy-haired and somewhat blear-eyed at\nthat early hour, the detective (who was not without an appreciation of\nthe simpler forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if\nit was up to the high reputation of the hotel. The result was that the\nwaiter yawned suddenly and woke up.\n\n“Do you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?”\n inquired Valentin. “Does changing the salt and sugar never pall on you\nas a jest?”\n\nThe waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stammeringly assured him that\nthe establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most\ncurious mistake. He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he\npicked up the salt-cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and\nmore bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying\naway, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also\nexamined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also\nlooked bewildered.\n\nSuddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words.\n\n“I zink,” he stuttered eagerly, “I zink it is those two clergy-men.”\n\n“What two clergymen?”\n\n“The two clergymen,” said the waiter, “that threw soup at the wall.”\n\n“Threw soup at the wall?” repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be\nsome singular Italian metaphor.\n\n“Yes, yes,” said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash\non the white paper; “threw it over there on the wall.”\n\nValentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with\nfuller reports.\n\n“Yes, sir,” he said, “it’s quite true, though I don’t suppose it has\nanything to do with the sugar and salt. Two clergymen came in and drank\nsoup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. They were\nboth very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went\nout; the other, who seemed a slower coach altogether, was some minutes\nlonger getting his things together. But he went at last. Only, the\ninstant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up\nhis cup, which he had only half emptied, and threw the soup slap on the\nwall. I was in the back room myself, and so was the waiter; so I could\nonly rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. It\ndon’t do any particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried\nto catch the men in the street. They were too far off though; I only\nnoticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street.”\n\nThe detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. He had\nalready decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could\nonly follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd\nenough. Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was\nsoon swinging round into the other street.\n\nIt was fortunate that even in such fevered moments his eye was cool and\nquick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet\nhe went back to look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and\nfruiterer’s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly\nticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent\ncompartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On\nthe heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold,\nblue chalk, “Best tangerine oranges, two a penny.” On the oranges was\nthe equally clear and exact description, “Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. a lb.”\n M. Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this\nhighly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He\ndrew the attention of the red-faced fruiterer, who was looking\nrather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his\nadvertisements. The fruiterer said nothing, but sharply put each\ncard into its proper place. The detective, leaning elegantly on his\nwalking-cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. At last he said, “Pray\nexcuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask\nyou a question in experimental psychology and the association of ideas.”\n\nThe red-faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he\ncontinued gaily, swinging his cane, “Why,” he pursued, “why are two\ntickets wrongly placed in a greengrocer’s shop like a shovel hat that\nhas come to London for a holiday? Or, in case I do not make myself\nclear, what is the mystical association which connects the idea of nuts\nmarked as oranges with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other\nshort?”\n\nThe eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail’s; he\nreally seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger.\nAt last he stammered angrily: “I don’t know what you ‘ave to do with it,\nbut if you’re one of their friends, you can tell ‘em from me that I’ll\nknock their silly ‘eads off, parsons or no parsons, if they upset my\napples again.”\n\n“Indeed?” asked the detective, with great sympathy. “Did they upset your\napples?”\n\n“One of ‘em did,” said the heated shopman; “rolled ‘em all over the\nstreet. I’d ‘ave caught the fool but for havin’ to pick ‘em up.”\n\n“Which way did these parsons go?” asked Valentin.\n\n“Up that second road on the left-hand side, and then across the square,”\n said the other promptly.\n\n“Thanks,” replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. On the other side\nof the second square he found a policeman, and said: “This is urgent,\nconstable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?”\n\nThe policeman began to chuckle heavily. “I ‘ave, sir; and if you arst\nme, one of ‘em was drunk. He stood in the middle of the road that\nbewildered that--”\n\n“Which way did they go?” snapped Valentin.\n\n“They took one of them yellow buses over there,” answered the man; “them\nthat go to Hampstead.”\n\nValentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: “Call up two\nof your men to come with me in pursuit,” and crossed the road with such\ncontagious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile\nobedience. In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the\nopposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes.\n\n“Well, sir,” began the former, with smiling importance, “and what\nmay--?”\n\nValentin pointed suddenly with his cane. “I’ll tell you on the top of\nthat omnibus,” he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of\nthe traffic. When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow\nvehicle, the inspector said: “We could go four times as quick in a\ntaxi.”\n\n“Quite true,” replied their leader placidly, “if we only had an idea of\nwhere we were going.”\n\n“Well, where are you going?” asked the other, staring.\n\nValentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his\ncigarette, he said: “If you know what a man’s doing, get in front of\nhim; but if you want to guess what he’s doing, keep behind him. Stray\nwhen he strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he. Then you may\nsee what he saw and may act as he acted. All we can do is to keep our\neyes skinned for a queer thing.”\n\n“What sort of queer thing do you mean?” asked the inspector.\n\n“Any sort of queer thing,” answered Valentin, and relapsed into\nobstinate silence.\n\nThe yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like\nhours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps\nhis assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps,\nalso, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours\ncrept long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the\nNorth London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like\nan infernal telescope. It was one of those journeys on which a man\nperpetually feels that now at last he must have come to the end of the\nuniverse, and then finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell\nPark. London died away in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then\nwas unaccountably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels.\nIt was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all\njust touching each other. But though the winter twilight was already\nthreatening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat\nsilent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on\neither side. By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen\nwere nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as\nValentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man’s shoulder, and shouted\nto the driver to stop.\n\nThey tumbled down the steps into the road without realising why they\nhad been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found\nValentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left\nside of the road. It was a large window, forming part of the long\nfacade of a gilt and palatial public-house; it was the part reserved for\nrespectable dining, and labelled “Restaurant.” This window, like all the\nrest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass;\nbut in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice.\n\n“Our cue at last,” cried Valentin, waving his stick; “the place with the\nbroken window.”\n\n“What window? What cue?” asked his principal assistant. “Why, what proof\nis there that this has anything to do with them?”\n\nValentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage.\n\n“Proof!” he cried. “Good God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of\ncourse, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with\nthem. But what else can we do? Don’t you see we must either follow one\nwild possibility or else go home to bed?” He banged his way into the\nrestaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a\nlate luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass\nfrom the inside. Not that it was very informative to them even then.\n\n“Got your window broken, I see,” said Valentin to the waiter as he paid\nthe bill.\n\n“Yes, sir,” answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to\nwhich Valentin silently added an enormous tip. The waiter straightened\nhimself with mild but unmistakable animation.\n\n“Ah, yes, sir,” he said. “Very odd thing, that, sir.”\n\n“Indeed?” Tell us about it,” said the detective with careless curiosity.\n\n“Well, two gents in black came in,” said the waiter; “two of those\nforeign parsons that are running about. They had a cheap and quiet\nlittle lunch, and one of them paid for it and went out. The other was\njust going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found\nhe’d paid me more than three times too much. ‘Here,’ I says to the chap\nwho was nearly out of the door, ‘you’ve paid too much.’ ‘Oh,’ he says,\nvery cool, ‘have we?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, and picks up the bill to show him.\nWell, that was a knock-out.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked his interlocutor.\n\n“Well, I’d have sworn on seven Bibles that I’d put 4s. on that bill. But\nnow I saw I’d put 14s., as plain as paint.”\n\n“Well?” cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, “and\nthen?”\n\n“The parson at the door he says all serene, ‘Sorry to confuse your\naccounts, but it’ll pay for the window.’ ‘What window?’ I says. ‘The\none I’m going to break,’ he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his\numbrella.”\n\nAll three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under\nhis breath, “Are we after escaped lunatics?” The waiter went on with\nsome relish for the ridiculous story:\n\n“I was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn’t do anything. The man\nmarched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner.\nThen they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn’t catch them,\nthough I ran round the bars to do it.”\n\n“Bullock Street,” said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as\nquickly as the strange couple he pursued.\n\nTheir journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels;\nstreets with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed\nbuilt out of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. Dusk was\ndeepening, and it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess\nin what exact direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was\npretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead\nHeath. Abruptly one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like\na bull’s-eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little\ngarish sweetstuff shop. After an instant’s hesitation he went in; he\nstood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravity\nand bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care. He was clearly\npreparing an opening; but he did not need one.\n\nAn angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant\nappearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door\nbehind him blocked with the blue uniform of the inspector, her eyes\nseemed to wake up.\n\n“Oh,” she said, “if you’ve come about that parcel, I’ve sent it off\nalready.”\n\n“Parcel?” repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring.\n\n“I mean the parcel the gentleman left--the clergyman gentleman.”\n\n“For goodness’ sake,” said Valentin, leaning forward with his first\nreal confession of eagerness, “for Heaven’s sake tell us what happened\nexactly.”\n\n“Well,” said the woman a little doubtfully, “the clergymen came in about\nhalf an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then\nwent off towards the Heath. But a second after, one of them runs\nback into the shop and says, ‘Have I left a parcel!’ Well, I looked\neverywhere and couldn’t see one; so he says, ‘Never mind; but if it\nshould turn up, please post it to this address,’ and he left me the\naddress and a shilling for my trouble. And sure enough, though I thought\nI’d looked everywhere, I found he’d left a brown paper parcel, so I\nposted it to the place he said. I can’t remember the address now; it\nwas somewhere in Westminster. But as the thing seemed so important, I\nthought perhaps the police had come about it.”\n\n“So they have,” said Valentin shortly. “Is Hampstead Heath near here?”\n\n“Straight on for fifteen minutes,” said the woman, “and you’ll come\nright out on the open.” Valentin sprang out of the shop and began to\nrun. The other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot.\n\nThe street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when\nthey came out unexpectedly into the void common and vast sky they were\nstartled to find the evening still so light and clear. A perfect dome\nof peacock-green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark\nviolet distances. The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick\nout in points of crystal one or two stars. All that was left of the\ndaylight lay in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that\npopular hollow which is called the Vale of Health. The holiday makers\nwho roam this region had not wholly dispersed; a few couples sat\nshapelessly on benches; and here and there a distant girl still shrieked\nin one of the swings. The glory of heaven deepened and darkened around\nthe sublime vulgarity of man; and standing on the slope and looking\nacross the valley, Valentin beheld the thing which he sought.\n\nAmong the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially\nblack which did not break--a group of two figures clerically clad.\nThough they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of\nthem was much smaller than the other. Though the other had a student’s\nstoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well\nover six feet high. He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his\nstick impatiently. By the time he had substantially diminished the\ndistance and magnified the two black figures as in a vast microscope,\nhe had perceived something else; something which startled him, and yet\nwhich he had somehow expected. Whoever was the tall priest, there could\nbe no doubt about the identity of the short one. It was his friend of\nthe Harwich train, the stumpy little cure of Essex whom he had warned\nabout his brown paper parcels.\n\nNow, so far as this went, everything fitted in finally and rationally\nenough. Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a Father\nBrown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires, a\nrelic of considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the\ncongress. This undoubtedly was the “silver with blue stones”; and Father\nBrown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. Now there\nwas nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out\nFlambeau had also found out; Flambeau found out everything. Also there\nwas nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire\ncross he should try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all\nnatural history. And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about\nthe fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly\nsheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels. He was the sort of\nman whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not\nsurprising that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could\nlead him to Hampstead Heath. So far the crime seemed clear enough; and\nwhile the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost\ndespised Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim. But when\nValentin thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had\nled him to his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or\nreason in it. What had the stealing of a blue-and-silver cross from a\npriest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper? What had it\nto do with calling nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and\nbreaking them afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet\nsomehow he had missed the middle of it. When he failed (which was\nseldom), he had usually grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the\ncriminal. Here he had grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp\nthe clue.\n\nThe two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies\nacross the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in\nconversation, and perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they\nwere certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath.\nAs their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified\nattitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and\neven to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the\nhunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the\ndiscussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word “reason”\n recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over\nan abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives\nactually lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the\ntrail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow\nof a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate\nsunset scenery. Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was\nan old ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in\nserious speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to\nthe darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from\npeacock-green to peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more\nand more like solid jewels. Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin\ncontrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there\nin deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first\ntime.\n\nAfter he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a\ndevilish doubt. Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the\nwastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on\nits thistles. For the two priests were talking exactly like priests,\npiously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of\ntheology. The little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round\nface turned to the strengthening stars; the other talked with his\nhead bowed, as if he were not even worthy to look at them. But no more\ninnocently clerical conversation could have been heard in any white\nItalian cloister or black Spanish cathedral.\n\nThe first he heard was the tail of one of Father Brown’s sentences,\nwhich ended: “... what they really meant in the Middle Ages by the\nheavens being incorruptible.”\n\nThe taller priest nodded his bowed head and said:\n\n“Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason; but who can\nlook at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be\nwonderful universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable?”\n\n“No,” said the other priest; “reason is always reasonable, even in the\nlast limbo, in the lost borderland of things. I know that people charge\nthe Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. Alone\non earth, the Church makes reason really supreme. Alone on earth, the\nChurch affirms that God himself is bound by reason.”\n\nThe other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said:\n\n“Yet who knows if in that infinite universe--?”\n\n“Only infinite physically,” said the little priest, turning sharply\nin his seat, “not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of\ntruth.”\n\nValentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury.\nHe seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom\nhe had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the\nmetaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons. In his impatience he lost\nthe equally elaborate answer of the tall cleric, and when he listened\nagain it was again Father Brown who was speaking:\n\n“Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. Look\nat those stars. Don’t they look as if they were single diamonds and\nsapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please.\nThink of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. Think the moon\nis a blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. But don’t fancy that all\nthat frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason\nand justice of conduct. On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of\npearl, you would still find a notice-board, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’”\n\nValentin was just in the act of rising from his rigid and crouching\nattitude and creeping away as softly as might be, felled by the one\ngreat folly of his life. But something in the very silence of the tall\npriest made him stop until the latter spoke. When at last he did speak,\nhe said simply, his head bowed and his hands on his knees:\n\n“Well, I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our\nreason. The mystery of heaven is unfathomable, and I for one can only\nbow my head.”\n\nThen, with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his\nattitude or voice, he added:\n\n“Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours, will you? We’re all alone\nhere, and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll.”\n\nThe utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to\nthat shocking change of speech. But the guarder of the relic only seemed\nto turn his head by the smallest section of the compass. He seemed still\nto have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars. Perhaps he had not\nunderstood. Or, perhaps, he had understood and sat rigid with terror.\n\n“Yes,” said the tall priest, in the same low voice and in the same still\nposture, “yes, I am Flambeau.”\n\nThen, after a pause, he said:\n\n“Come, will you give me that cross?”\n\n“No,” said the other, and the monosyllable had an odd sound.\n\nFlambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions. The great\nrobber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long.\n\n“No,” he cried, “you won’t give it me, you proud prelate. You won’t give\nit me, you little celibate simpleton. Shall I tell you why you won’t\ngive it me? Because I’ve got it already in my own breast-pocket.”\n\nThe small man from Essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the\ndusk, and said, with the timid eagerness of “The Private Secretary”:\n\n“Are--are you sure?”\n\nFlambeau yelled with delight.\n\n“Really, you’re as good as a three-act farce,” he cried. “Yes, you\nturnip, I am quite sure. I had the sense to make a duplicate of the\nright parcel, and now, my friend, you’ve got the duplicate and I’ve got\nthe jewels. An old dodge, Father Brown--a very old dodge.”\n\n“Yes,” said Father Brown, and passed his hand through his hair with the\nsame strange vagueness of manner. “Yes, I’ve heard of it before.”\n\nThe colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a\nsort of sudden interest.\n\n“You have heard of it?” he asked. “Where have you heard of it?”\n\n“Well, I mustn’t tell you his name, of course,” said the little man\nsimply. “He was a penitent, you know. He had lived prosperously for\nabout twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels. And so,\nyou see, when I began to suspect you, I thought of this poor chap’s way\nof doing it at once.”\n\n“Began to suspect me?” repeated the outlaw with increased intensity.\n“Did you really have the gumption to suspect me just because I brought\nyou up to this bare part of the heath?”\n\n“No, no,” said Brown with an air of apology. “You see, I suspected you\nwhen we first met. It’s that little bulge up the sleeve where you people\nhave the spiked bracelet.”\n\n“How in Tartarus,” cried Flambeau, “did you ever hear of the spiked\nbracelet?”\n\n“Oh, one’s little flock, you know!” said Father Brown, arching his\neyebrows rather blankly. “When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were\nthree of them with spiked bracelets. So, as I suspected you from the\nfirst, don’t you see, I made sure that the cross should go safe, anyhow.\nI’m afraid I watched you, you know. So at last I saw you change the\nparcels. Then, don’t you see, I changed them back again. And then I left\nthe right one behind.”\n\n“Left it behind?” repeated Flambeau, and for the first time there was\nanother note in his voice beside his triumph.\n\n“Well, it was like this,” said the little priest, speaking in the same\nunaffected way. “I went back to that sweet-shop and asked if I’d left a\nparcel, and gave them a particular address if it turned up. Well, I knew\nI hadn’t; but when I went away again I did. So, instead of running after\nme with that valuable parcel, they have sent it flying to a friend of\nmine in Westminster.” Then he added rather sadly: “I learnt that, too,\nfrom a poor fellow in Hartlepool. He used to do it with handbags he\nstole at railway stations, but he’s in a monastery now. Oh, one gets to\nknow, you know,” he added, rubbing his head again with the same sort of\ndesperate apology. “We can’t help being priests. People come and tell us\nthese things.”\n\nFlambeau tore a brown-paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it\nin pieces. There was nothing but paper and sticks of lead inside it. He\nsprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture, and cried:\n\n“I don’t believe you. I don’t believe a bumpkin like you could manage\nall that. I believe you’ve still got the stuff on you, and if you don’t\ngive it up--why, we’re all alone, and I’ll take it by force!”\n\n“No,” said Father Brown simply, and stood up also, “you won’t take it\nby force. First, because I really haven’t still got it. And, second,\nbecause we are not alone.”\n\nFlambeau stopped in his stride forward.\n\n“Behind that tree,” said Father Brown, pointing, “are two strong\npolicemen and the greatest detective alive. How did they come here, do\nyou ask? Why, I brought them, of course! How did I do it? Why, I’ll tell\nyou if you like! Lord bless you, we have to know twenty such things\nwhen we work among the criminal classes! Well, I wasn’t sure you were\na thief, and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our\nown clergy. So I just tested you to see if anything would make you show\nyourself. A man generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his\ncoffee; if he doesn’t, he has some reason for keeping quiet. I changed\nthe salt and sugar, and you kept quiet. A man generally objects if\nhis bill is three times too big. If he pays it, he has some motive for\npassing unnoticed. I altered your bill, and you paid it.”\n\nThe world seemed waiting for Flambeau to leap like a tiger. But he was\nheld back as by a spell; he was stunned with the utmost curiosity.\n\n“Well,” went on Father Brown, with lumbering lucidity, “as you wouldn’t\nleave any tracks for the police, of course somebody had to. At every\nplace we went to, I took care to do something that would get us talked\nabout for the rest of the day. I didn’t do much harm--a splashed wall,\nspilt apples, a broken window; but I saved the cross, as the cross will\nalways be saved. It is at Westminster by now. I rather wonder you didn’t\nstop it with the Donkey’s Whistle.”\n\n“With the what?” asked Flambeau.\n\n“I’m glad you’ve never heard of it,” said the priest, making a face.\n“It’s a foul thing. I’m sure you’re too good a man for a Whistler. I\ncouldn’t have countered it even with the Spots myself; I’m not strong\nenough in the legs.”\n\n“What on earth are you talking about?” asked the other.\n\n“Well, I did think you’d know the Spots,” said Father Brown, agreeably\nsurprised. “Oh, you can’t have gone so very wrong yet!”\n\n“How in blazes do you know all these horrors?” cried Flambeau.\n\nThe shadow of a smile crossed the round, simple face of his clerical\nopponent.\n\n“Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose,” he said. “Has it never\nstruck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins\nis not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a matter of\nfact, another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren’t a priest.”\n\n“What?” asked the thief, almost gaping.\n\n“You attacked reason,” said Father Brown. “It’s bad theology.”\n\nAnd even as he turned away to collect his property, the three policemen\ncame out from under the twilight trees. Flambeau was an artist and a\nsportsman. He stepped back and swept Valentin a great bow.\n\n“Do not bow to me, mon ami,” said Valentin with silver clearness. “Let\nus both bow to our master.”\n\nAnd they both stood an instant uncovered while the little Essex priest\nblinked about for his umbrella.\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\n\nAristide Valentin, Chief of the Paris Police, was late for his dinner,\nand some of his guests began to arrive before him. These were, however,\nreassured by his confidential servant, Ivan, the old man with a scar,\nand a face almost as grey as his moustaches, who always sat at a table\nin the entrance hall--a hall hung with weapons. Valentin’s house was\nperhaps as peculiar and celebrated as its master. It was an old house,\nwith high walls and tall poplars almost overhanging the Seine; but the\noddity--and perhaps the police value--of its architecture was this: that\nthere was no ultimate exit at all except through this front door, which\nwas guarded by Ivan and the armoury. The garden was large and elaborate,\nand there were many exits from the house into the garden. But there was\nno exit from the garden into the world outside; all round it ran a tall,\nsmooth, unscalable wall with special spikes at the top; no bad garden,\nperhaps, for a man to reflect in whom some hundred criminals had sworn\nto kill.\n\nAs Ivan explained to the guests, their host had telephoned that he\nwas detained for ten minutes. He was, in truth, making some last\narrangements about executions and such ugly things; and though these\nduties were rootedly repulsive to him, he always performed them with\nprecision. Ruthless in the pursuit of criminals, he was very mild about\ntheir punishment. Since he had been supreme over French--and largely\nover European--policial methods, his great influence had been honourably\nused for the mitigation of sentences and the purification of prisons.\nHe was one of the great humanitarian French freethinkers; and the only\nthing wrong with them is that they make mercy even colder than justice.\n\nWhen Valentin arrived he was already dressed in black clothes and the\nred rosette--an elegant figure, his dark beard already streaked with\ngrey. He went straight through his house to his study, which opened on\nthe grounds behind. The garden door of it was open, and after he had\ncarefully locked his box in its official place, he stood for a few\nseconds at the open door looking out upon the garden. A sharp moon\nwas fighting with the flying rags and tatters of a storm, and Valentin\nregarded it with a wistfulness unusual in such scientific natures as\nhis. Perhaps such scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the\nmost tremendous problem of their lives. From any such occult mood,\nat least, he quickly recovered, for he knew he was late, and that his\nguests had already begun to arrive. A glance at his drawing-room when he\nentered it was enough to make certain that his principal guest was not\nthere, at any rate. He saw all the other pillars of the little party;\nhe saw Lord Galloway, the English Ambassador--a choleric old man with a\nrusset face like an apple, wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter. He\nsaw Lady Galloway, slim and threadlike, with silver hair and a face\nsensitive and superior. He saw her daughter, Lady Margaret Graham, a\npale and pretty girl with an elfish face and copper-coloured hair. He\nsaw the Duchess of Mont St. Michel, black-eyed and opulent, and with\nher her two daughters, black-eyed and opulent also. He saw Dr. Simon,\na typical French scientist, with glasses, a pointed brown beard, and a\nforehead barred with those parallel wrinkles which are the penalty\nof superciliousness, since they come through constantly elevating\nthe eyebrows. He saw Father Brown, of Cobhole, in Essex, whom he had\nrecently met in England. He saw--perhaps with more interest than any\nof these--a tall man in uniform, who had bowed to the Galloways without\nreceiving any very hearty acknowledgment, and who now advanced alone to\npay his respects to his host. This was Commandant O’Brien, of the\nFrench Foreign Legion. He was a slim yet somewhat swaggering figure,\nclean-shaven, dark-haired, and blue-eyed, and, as seemed natural in an\nofficer of that famous regiment of victorious failures and successful\nsuicides, he had an air at once dashing and melancholy. He was by birth\nan Irish gentleman, and in boyhood had known the Galloways--especially\nMargaret Graham. He had left his country after some crash of debts, and\nnow expressed his complete freedom from British etiquette by swinging\nabout in uniform, sabre and spurs. When he bowed to the Ambassador’s\nfamily, Lord and Lady Galloway bent stiffly, and Lady Margaret looked\naway.\n\nBut for whatever old causes such people might be interested in each\nother, their distinguished host was not specially interested in them. No\none of them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. Valentin\nwas expecting, for special reasons, a man of world-wide fame, whose\nfriendship he had secured during some of his great detective tours and\ntriumphs in the United States. He was expecting Julius K. Brayne, that\nmulti-millionaire whose colossal and even crushing endowments of small\nreligions have occasioned so much easy sport and easier solemnity for\nthe American and English papers. Nobody could quite make out whether Mr.\nBrayne was an atheist or a Mormon or a Christian Scientist; but he was\nready to pour money into any intellectual vessel, so long as it was\nan untried vessel. One of his hobbies was to wait for the American\nShakespeare--a hobby more patient than angling. He admired Walt Whitman,\nbut thought that Luke P. Tanner, of Paris, Pa., was more “progressive”\n than Whitman any day. He liked anything that he thought “progressive.”\n He thought Valentin “progressive,” thereby doing him a grave injustice.\n\nThe solid appearance of Julius K. Brayne in the room was as decisive\nas a dinner bell. He had this great quality, which very few of us\ncan claim, that his presence was as big as his absence. He was a huge\nfellow, as fat as he was tall, clad in complete evening black, without\nso much relief as a watch-chain or a ring. His hair was white and well\nbrushed back like a German’s; his face was red, fierce and cherubic,\nwith one dark tuft under the lower lip that threw up that otherwise\ninfantile visage with an effect theatrical and even Mephistophelean. Not\nlong, however, did that salon merely stare at the celebrated American;\nhis lateness had already become a domestic problem, and he was sent with\nall speed into the dining-room with Lady Galloway on his arm.\n\nExcept on one point the Galloways were genial and casual enough. So long\nas Lady Margaret did not take the arm of that adventurer O’Brien, her\nfather was quite satisfied; and she had not done so, she had decorously\ngone in with Dr. Simon. Nevertheless, old Lord Galloway was restless and\nalmost rude. He was diplomatic enough during dinner, but when, over the\ncigars, three of the younger men--Simon the doctor, Brown the priest,\nand the detrimental O’Brien, the exile in a foreign uniform--all melted\naway to mix with the ladies or smoke in the conservatory, then the\nEnglish diplomatist grew very undiplomatic indeed. He was stung\nevery sixty seconds with the thought that the scamp O’Brien might be\nsignalling to Margaret somehow; he did not attempt to imagine how. He\nwas left over the coffee with Brayne, the hoary Yankee who believed\nin all religions, and Valentin, the grizzled Frenchman who believed in\nnone. They could argue with each other, but neither could appeal to\nhim. After a time this “progressive” logomachy had reached a crisis of\ntedium; Lord Galloway got up also and sought the drawing-room. He lost\nhis way in long passages for some six or eight minutes: till he heard\nthe high-pitched, didactic voice of the doctor, and then the dull voice\nof the priest, followed by general laughter. They also, he thought with\na curse, were probably arguing about “science and religion.” But the\ninstant he opened the salon door he saw only one thing--he saw what\nwas not there. He saw that Commandant O’Brien was absent, and that Lady\nMargaret was absent too.\n\nRising impatiently from the drawing-room, as he had from the\ndining-room, he stamped along the passage once more. His notion of\nprotecting his daughter from the Irish-Algerian n’er-do-well had become\nsomething central and even mad in his mind. As he went towards the back\nof the house, where was Valentin’s study, he was surprised to meet his\ndaughter, who swept past with a white, scornful face, which was a second\nenigma. If she had been with O’Brien, where was O’Brien! If she had\nnot been with O’Brien, where had she been? With a sort of senile and\npassionate suspicion he groped his way to the dark back parts of the\nmansion, and eventually found a servants’ entrance that opened on to the\ngarden. The moon with her scimitar had now ripped up and rolled away all\nthe storm-wrack. The argent light lit up all four corners of the garden.\nA tall figure in blue was striding across the lawn towards the study\ndoor; a glint of moonlit silver on his facings picked him out as\nCommandant O’Brien.\n\nHe vanished through the French windows into the house, leaving Lord\nGalloway in an indescribable temper, at once virulent and vague. The\nblue-and-silver garden, like a scene in a theatre, seemed to taunt him\nwith all that tyrannic tenderness against which his worldly authority\nwas at war. The length and grace of the Irishman’s stride enraged him as\nif he were a rival instead of a father; the moonlight maddened him.\nHe was trapped as if by magic into a garden of troubadours, a Watteau\nfairyland; and, willing to shake off such amorous imbecilities by\nspeech, he stepped briskly after his enemy. As he did so he tripped over\nsome tree or stone in the grass; looked down at it first with irritation\nand then a second time with curiosity. The next instant the moon and the\ntall poplars looked at an unusual sight--an elderly English diplomatist\nrunning hard and crying or bellowing as he ran.\n\nHis hoarse shouts brought a pale face to the study door, the beaming\nglasses and worried brow of Dr. Simon, who heard the nobleman’s first\nclear words. Lord Galloway was crying: “A corpse in the grass--a\nblood-stained corpse.” O’Brien at last had gone utterly out of his mind.\n\n“We must tell Valentin at once,” said the doctor, when the other had\nbrokenly described all that he had dared to examine. “It is fortunate\nthat he is here;” and even as he spoke the great detective entered the\nstudy, attracted by the cry. It was almost amusing to note his typical\ntransformation; he had come with the common concern of a host and a\ngentleman, fearing that some guest or servant was ill. When he was\ntold the gory fact, he turned with all his gravity instantly bright and\nbusinesslike; for this, however abrupt and awful, was his business.\n\n“Strange, gentlemen,” he said as they hurried out into the garden, “that\nI should have hunted mysteries all over the earth, and now one comes and\nsettles in my own back-yard. But where is the place?” They crossed the\nlawn less easily, as a slight mist had begun to rise from the river; but\nunder the guidance of the shaken Galloway they found the body sunken\nin deep grass--the body of a very tall and broad-shouldered man. He lay\nface downwards, so they could only see that his big shoulders were clad\nin black cloth, and that his big head was bald, except for a wisp or\ntwo of brown hair that clung to his skull like wet seaweed. A scarlet\nserpent of blood crawled from under his fallen face.\n\n“At least,” said Simon, with a deep and singular intonation, “he is none\nof our party.”\n\n“Examine him, doctor,” cried Valentin rather sharply. “He may not be\ndead.”\n\nThe doctor bent down. “He is not quite cold, but I am afraid he is dead\nenough,” he answered. “Just help me to lift him up.”\n\nThey lifted him carefully an inch from the ground, and all doubts as\nto his being really dead were settled at once and frightfully. The head\nfell away. It had been entirely sundered from the body; whoever had\ncut his throat had managed to sever the neck as well. Even Valentin\nwas slightly shocked. “He must have been as strong as a gorilla,” he\nmuttered.\n\nNot without a shiver, though he was used to anatomical abortions, Dr.\nSimon lifted the head. It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw,\nbut the face was substantially unhurt. It was a ponderous, yellow face,\nat once sunken and swollen, with a hawk-like nose and heavy lids--a face\nof a wicked Roman emperor, with, perhaps, a distant touch of a Chinese\nemperor. All present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of\nignorance. Nothing else could be noted about the man except that, as\nthey had lifted his body, they had seen underneath it the white gleam of\na shirt-front defaced with a red gleam of blood. As Dr. Simon said,\nthe man had never been of their party. But he might very well have been\ntrying to join it, for he had come dressed for such an occasion.\n\nValentin went down on his hands and knees and examined with his closest\nprofessional attention the grass and ground for some twenty yards round\nthe body, in which he was assisted less skillfully by the doctor, and\nquite vaguely by the English lord. Nothing rewarded their grovellings\nexcept a few twigs, snapped or chopped into very small lengths, which\nValentin lifted for an instant’s examination and then tossed away.\n\n“Twigs,” he said gravely; “twigs, and a total stranger with his head cut\noff; that is all there is on this lawn.”\n\nThere was an almost creepy stillness, and then the unnerved Galloway\ncalled out sharply:\n\n“Who’s that! Who’s that over there by the garden wall!”\n\nA small figure with a foolishly large head drew waveringly near them in\nthe moonlit haze; looked for an instant like a goblin, but turned out to\nbe the harmless little priest whom they had left in the drawing-room.\n\n“I say,” he said meekly, “there are no gates to this garden, do you\nknow.”\n\nValentin’s black brows had come together somewhat crossly, as they did\non principle at the sight of the cassock. But he was far too just a man\nto deny the relevance of the remark. “You are right,” he said. “Before\nwe find out how he came to be killed, we may have to find out how he\ncame to be here. Now listen to me, gentlemen. If it can be done without\nprejudice to my position and duty, we shall all agree that certain\ndistinguished names might well be kept out of this. There are ladies,\ngentlemen, and there is a foreign ambassador. If we must mark it down as\na crime, then it must be followed up as a crime. But till then I can use\nmy own discretion. I am the head of the police; I am so public that I\ncan afford to be private. Please Heaven, I will clear everyone of my own\nguests before I call in my men to look for anybody else. Gentlemen, upon\nyour honour, you will none of you leave the house till tomorrow at noon;\nthere are bedrooms for all. Simon, I think you know where to find my\nman, Ivan, in the front hall; he is a confidential man. Tell him to\nleave another servant on guard and come to me at once. Lord Galloway,\nyou are certainly the best person to tell the ladies what has happened,\nand prevent a panic. They also must stay. Father Brown and I will remain\nwith the body.”\n\nWhen this spirit of the captain spoke in Valentin he was obeyed like a\nbugle. Dr. Simon went through to the armoury and routed out Ivan, the\npublic detective’s private detective. Galloway went to the drawing-room\nand told the terrible news tactfully enough, so that by the time the\ncompany assembled there the ladies were already startled and already\nsoothed. Meanwhile the good priest and the good atheist stood at the\nhead and foot of the dead man motionless in the moonlight, like symbolic\nstatues of their two philosophies of death.\n\nIvan, the confidential man with the scar and the moustaches, came out\nof the house like a cannon ball, and came racing across the lawn to\nValentin like a dog to his master. His livid face was quite lively\nwith the glow of this domestic detective story, and it was with almost\nunpleasant eagerness that he asked his master’s permission to examine\nthe remains.\n\n“Yes; look, if you like, Ivan,” said Valentin, “but don’t be long. We\nmust go in and thrash this out in the house.”\n\nIvan lifted the head, and then almost let it drop.\n\n“Why,” he gasped, “it’s--no, it isn’t; it can’t be. Do you know this\nman, sir?”\n\n“No,” said Valentin indifferently; “we had better go inside.”\n\nBetween them they carried the corpse to a sofa in the study, and then\nall made their way to the drawing-room.\n\nThe detective sat down at a desk quietly, and even without hesitation;\nbut his eye was the iron eye of a judge at assize. He made a few rapid\nnotes upon paper in front of him, and then said shortly: “Is everybody\nhere?”\n\n“Not Mr. Brayne,” said the Duchess of Mont St. Michel, looking round.\n\n“No,” said Lord Galloway in a hoarse, harsh voice. “And not Mr. Neil\nO’Brien, I fancy. I saw that gentleman walking in the garden when the\ncorpse was still warm.”\n\n“Ivan,” said the detective, “go and fetch Commandant O’Brien and Mr.\nBrayne. Mr. Brayne, I know, is finishing a cigar in the dining-room;\nCommandant O’Brien, I think, is walking up and down the conservatory. I\nam not sure.”\n\nThe faithful attendant flashed from the room, and before anyone could\nstir or speak Valentin went on with the same soldierly swiftness of\nexposition.\n\n“Everyone here knows that a dead man has been found in the garden, his\nhead cut clean from his body. Dr. Simon, you have examined it. Do you\nthink that to cut a man’s throat like that would need great force? Or,\nperhaps, only a very sharp knife?”\n\n“I should say that it could not be done with a knife at all,” said the\npale doctor.\n\n“Have you any thought,” resumed Valentin, “of a tool with which it could\nbe done?”\n\n“Speaking within modern probabilities, I really haven’t,” said the\ndoctor, arching his painful brows. “It’s not easy to hack a neck through\neven clumsily, and this was a very clean cut. It could be done with a\nbattle-axe or an old headsman’s axe, or an old two-handed sword.”\n\n“But, good heavens!” cried the Duchess, almost in hysterics, “there\naren’t any two-handed swords and battle-axes round here.”\n\nValentin was still busy with the paper in front of him. “Tell me,” he\nsaid, still writing rapidly, “could it have been done with a long French\ncavalry sabre?”\n\nA low knocking came at the door, which, for some unreasonable reason,\ncurdled everyone’s blood like the knocking in Macbeth. Amid that frozen\nsilence Dr. Simon managed to say: “A sabre--yes, I suppose it could.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Valentin. “Come in, Ivan.”\n\nThe confidential Ivan opened the door and ushered in Commandant Neil\nO’Brien, whom he had found at last pacing the garden again.\n\nThe Irish officer stood up disordered and defiant on the threshold.\n“What do you want with me?” he cried.\n\n“Please sit down,” said Valentin in pleasant, level tones. “Why, you\naren’t wearing your sword. Where is it?”\n\n“I left it on the library table,” said O’Brien, his brogue deepening in\nhis disturbed mood. “It was a nuisance, it was getting--”\n\n“Ivan,” said Valentin, “please go and get the Commandant’s sword from\nthe library.” Then, as the servant vanished, “Lord Galloway says he saw\nyou leaving the garden just before he found the corpse. What were you\ndoing in the garden?”\n\nThe Commandant flung himself recklessly into a chair. “Oh,” he cried in\npure Irish, “admirin’ the moon. Communing with Nature, me bhoy.”\n\nA heavy silence sank and endured, and at the end of it came again that\ntrivial and terrible knocking. Ivan reappeared, carrying an empty steel\nscabbard. “This is all I can find,” he said.\n\n“Put it on the table,” said Valentin, without looking up.\n\nThere was an inhuman silence in the room, like that sea of inhuman\nsilence round the dock of the condemned murderer. The Duchess’s weak\nexclamations had long ago died away. Lord Galloway’s swollen hatred was\nsatisfied and even sobered. The voice that came was quite unexpected.\n\n“I think I can tell you,” cried Lady Margaret, in that clear, quivering\nvoice with which a courageous woman speaks publicly. “I can tell you\nwhat Mr. O’Brien was doing in the garden, since he is bound to\nsilence. He was asking me to marry him. I refused; I said in my family\ncircumstances I could give him nothing but my respect. He was a little\nangry at that; he did not seem to think much of my respect. I wonder,”\n she added, with rather a wan smile, “if he will care at all for it now.\nFor I offer it him now. I will swear anywhere that he never did a thing\nlike this.”\n\nLord Galloway had edged up to his daughter, and was intimidating her in\nwhat he imagined to be an undertone. “Hold your tongue, Maggie,” he said\nin a thunderous whisper. “Why should you shield the fellow? Where’s his\nsword? Where’s his confounded cavalry--”\n\nHe stopped because of the singular stare with which his daughter was\nregarding him, a look that was indeed a lurid magnet for the whole\ngroup.\n\n“You old fool!” she said in a low voice without pretence of piety, “what\ndo you suppose you are trying to prove? I tell you this man was innocent\nwhile with me. But if he wasn’t innocent, he was still with me. If he\nmurdered a man in the garden, who was it who must have seen--who must\nat least have known? Do you hate Neil so much as to put your own\ndaughter--”\n\nLady Galloway screamed. Everyone else sat tingling at the touch of those\nsatanic tragedies that have been between lovers before now. They saw\nthe proud, white face of the Scotch aristocrat and her lover, the Irish\nadventurer, like old portraits in a dark house. The long silence was\nfull of formless historical memories of murdered husbands and poisonous\nparamours.\n\nIn the centre of this morbid silence an innocent voice said: “Was it a\nvery long cigar?”\n\nThe change of thought was so sharp that they had to look round to see\nwho had spoken.\n\n“I mean,” said little Father Brown, from the corner of the room, “I\nmean that cigar Mr. Brayne is finishing. It seems nearly as long as a\nwalking-stick.”\n\nDespite the irrelevance there was assent as well as irritation in\nValentin’s face as he lifted his head.\n\n“Quite right,” he remarked sharply. “Ivan, go and see about Mr. Brayne\nagain, and bring him here at once.”\n\nThe instant the factotum had closed the door, Valentin addressed the\ngirl with an entirely new earnestness.\n\n“Lady Margaret,” he said, “we all feel, I am sure, both gratitude\nand admiration for your act in rising above your lower dignity and\nexplaining the Commandant’s conduct. But there is a hiatus still.\nLord Galloway, I understand, met you passing from the study to the\ndrawing-room, and it was only some minutes afterwards that he found the\ngarden and the Commandant still walking there.”\n\n“You have to remember,” replied Margaret, with a faint irony in her\nvoice, “that I had just refused him, so we should scarcely have come\nback arm in arm. He is a gentleman, anyhow; and he loitered behind--and\nso got charged with murder.”\n\n“In those few moments,” said Valentin gravely, “he might really--”\n\nThe knock came again, and Ivan put in his scarred face.\n\n“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, “but Mr. Brayne has left the house.”\n\n“Left!” cried Valentin, and rose for the first time to his feet.\n\n“Gone. Scooted. Evaporated,” replied Ivan in humorous French. “His hat\nand coat are gone, too, and I’ll tell you something to cap it all. I ran\noutside the house to find any traces of him, and I found one, and a big\ntrace, too.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Valentin.\n\n“I’ll show you,” said his servant, and reappeared with a flashing naked\ncavalry sabre, streaked with blood about the point and edge. Everyone in\nthe room eyed it as if it were a thunderbolt; but the experienced Ivan\nwent on quite quietly:\n\n“I found this,” he said, “flung among the bushes fifty yards up the road\nto Paris. In other words, I found it just where your respectable Mr.\nBrayne threw it when he ran away.”\n\nThere was again a silence, but of a new sort. Valentin took the sabre,\nexamined it, reflected with unaffected concentration of thought, and\nthen turned a respectful face to O’Brien. “Commandant,” he said, “we\ntrust you will always produce this weapon if it is wanted for police\nexamination. Meanwhile,” he added, slapping the steel back in the\nringing scabbard, “let me return you your sword.”\n\nAt the military symbolism of the action the audience could hardly\nrefrain from applause.\n\nFor Neil O’Brien, indeed, that gesture was the turning-point of\nexistence. By the time he was wandering in the mysterious garden again\nin the colours of the morning the tragic futility of his ordinary mien\nhad fallen from him; he was a man with many reasons for happiness. Lord\nGalloway was a gentleman, and had offered him an apology. Lady Margaret\nwas something better than a lady, a woman at least, and had perhaps\ngiven him something better than an apology, as they drifted among the\nold flowerbeds before breakfast. The whole company was more lighthearted\nand humane, for though the riddle of the death remained, the load of\nsuspicion was lifted off them all, and sent flying off to Paris with the\nstrange millionaire--a man they hardly knew. The devil was cast out of\nthe house--he had cast himself out.\n\nStill, the riddle remained; and when O’Brien threw himself on a garden\nseat beside Dr. Simon, that keenly scientific person at once resumed\nit. He did not get much talk out of O’Brien, whose thoughts were on\npleasanter things.\n\n“I can’t say it interests me much,” said the Irishman frankly,\n“especially as it seems pretty plain now. Apparently Brayne hated this\nstranger for some reason; lured him into the garden, and killed him with\nmy sword. Then he fled to the city, tossing the sword away as he went.\nBy the way, Ivan tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his\npocket. So he was a countryman of Brayne’s, and that seems to clinch it.\nI don’t see any difficulties about the business.”\n\n“There are five colossal difficulties,” said the doctor quietly; “like\nhigh walls within walls. Don’t mistake me. I don’t doubt that Brayne\ndid it; his flight, I fancy, proves that. But as to how he did it.\nFirst difficulty: Why should a man kill another man with a great hulking\nsabre, when he can almost kill him with a pocket knife and put it back\nin his pocket? Second difficulty: Why was there no noise or outcry?\nDoes a man commonly see another come up waving a scimitar and offer\nno remarks? Third difficulty: A servant watched the front door all the\nevening; and a rat cannot get into Valentin’s garden anywhere. How did\nthe dead man get into the garden? Fourth difficulty: Given the same\nconditions, how did Brayne get out of the garden?”\n\n“And the fifth,” said Neil, with eyes fixed on the English priest who\nwas coming slowly up the path.\n\n“Is a trifle, I suppose,” said the doctor, “but I think an odd one. When\nI first saw how the head had been slashed, I supposed the assassin had\nstruck more than once. But on examination I found many cuts across the\ntruncated section; in other words, they were struck after the head was\noff. Did Brayne hate his foe so fiendishly that he stood sabring his\nbody in the moonlight?”\n\n“Horrible!” said O’Brien, and shuddered.\n\nThe little priest, Brown, had arrived while they were talking, and had\nwaited, with characteristic shyness, till they had finished. Then he\nsaid awkwardly:\n\n“I say, I’m sorry to interrupt. But I was sent to tell you the news!”\n\n“News?” repeated Simon, and stared at him rather painfully through his\nglasses.\n\n“Yes, I’m sorry,” said Father Brown mildly. “There’s been another\nmurder, you know.”\n\nBoth men on the seat sprang up, leaving it rocking.\n\n“And, what’s stranger still,” continued the priest, with his dull eye\non the rhododendrons, “it’s the same disgusting sort; it’s another\nbeheading. They found the second head actually bleeding into the river,\na few yards along Brayne’s road to Paris; so they suppose that he--”\n\n“Great Heaven!” cried O’Brien. “Is Brayne a monomaniac?”\n\n“There are American vendettas,” said the priest impassively. Then he\nadded: “They want you to come to the library and see it.”\n\nCommandant O’Brien followed the others towards the inquest, feeling\ndecidedly sick. As a soldier, he loathed all this secretive carnage;\nwhere were these extravagant amputations going to stop? First one\nhead was hacked off, and then another; in this case (he told himself\nbitterly) it was not true that two heads were better than one. As he\ncrossed the study he almost staggered at a shocking coincidence. Upon\nValentin’s table lay the coloured picture of yet a third bleeding head;\nand it was the head of Valentin himself. A second glance showed him it\nwas only a Nationalist paper, called The Guillotine, which every week\nshowed one of its political opponents with rolling eyes and writhing\nfeatures just after execution; for Valentin was an anti-clerical of some\nnote. But O’Brien was an Irishman, with a kind of chastity even in his\nsins; and his gorge rose against that great brutality of the intellect\nwhich belongs only to France. He felt Paris as a whole, from the\ngrotesques on the Gothic churches to the gross caricatures in the\nnewspapers. He remembered the gigantic jests of the Revolution. He saw\nthe whole city as one ugly energy, from the sanguinary sketch lying on\nValentin’s table up to where, above a mountain and forest of gargoyles,\nthe great devil grins on Notre Dame.\n\nThe library was long, low, and dark; what light entered it shot from\nunder low blinds and had still some of the ruddy tinge of morning.\nValentin and his servant Ivan were waiting for them at the upper end of\na long, slightly-sloping desk, on which lay the mortal remains, looking\nenormous in the twilight. The big black figure and yellow face of the\nman found in the garden confronted them essentially unchanged. The\nsecond head, which had been fished from among the river reeds that\nmorning, lay streaming and dripping beside it; Valentin’s men were still\nseeking to recover the rest of this second corpse, which was supposed\nto be afloat. Father Brown, who did not seem to share O’Brien’s\nsensibilities in the least, went up to the second head and examined it\nwith his blinking care. It was little more than a mop of wet white hair,\nfringed with silver fire in the red and level morning light; the face,\nwhich seemed of an ugly, empurpled and perhaps criminal type, had been\nmuch battered against trees or stones as it tossed in the water.\n\n“Good morning, Commandant O’Brien,” said Valentin, with quiet\ncordiality. “You have heard of Brayne’s last experiment in butchery, I\nsuppose?”\n\nFather Brown was still bending over the head with white hair, and he\nsaid, without looking up:\n\n“I suppose it is quite certain that Brayne cut off this head, too.”\n\n“Well, it seems common sense,” said Valentin, with his hands in his\npockets. “Killed in the same way as the other. Found within a few yards\nof the other. And sliced by the same weapon which we know he carried\naway.”\n\n“Yes, yes; I know,” replied Father Brown submissively. “Yet, you know, I\ndoubt whether Brayne could have cut off this head.”\n\n“Why not?” inquired Dr. Simon, with a rational stare.\n\n“Well, doctor,” said the priest, looking up blinking, “can a man cut off\nhis own head? I don’t know.”\n\nO’Brien felt an insane universe crashing about his ears; but the doctor\nsprang forward with impetuous practicality and pushed back the wet white\nhair.\n\n“Oh, there’s no doubt it’s Brayne,” said the priest quietly. “He had\nexactly that chip in the left ear.”\n\nThe detective, who had been regarding the priest with steady and\nglittering eyes, opened his clenched mouth and said sharply: “You seem\nto know a lot about him, Father Brown.”\n\n“I do,” said the little man simply. “I’ve been about with him for some\nweeks. He was thinking of joining our church.”\n\nThe star of the fanatic sprang into Valentin’s eyes; he strode towards\nthe priest with clenched hands. “And, perhaps,” he cried, with a\nblasting sneer, “perhaps he was also thinking of leaving all his money\nto your church.”\n\n“Perhaps he was,” said Brown stolidly; “it is possible.”\n\n“In that case,” cried Valentin, with a dreadful smile, “you may indeed\nknow a great deal about him. About his life and about his--”\n\nCommandant O’Brien laid a hand on Valentin’s arm. “Drop that slanderous\nrubbish, Valentin,” he said, “or there may be more swords yet.”\n\nBut Valentin (under the steady, humble gaze of the priest) had already\nrecovered himself. “Well,” he said shortly, “people’s private opinions\ncan wait. You gentlemen are still bound by your promise to stay; you\nmust enforce it on yourselves--and on each other. Ivan here will tell\nyou anything more you want to know; I must get to business and write to\nthe authorities. We can’t keep this quiet any longer. I shall be writing\nin my study if there is any more news.”\n\n“Is there any more news, Ivan?” asked Dr. Simon, as the chief of police\nstrode out of the room.\n\n“Only one more thing, I think, sir,” said Ivan, wrinkling up his grey\nold face, “but that’s important, too, in its way. There’s that old\nbuffer you found on the lawn,” and he pointed without pretence of\nreverence at the big black body with the yellow head. “We’ve found out\nwho he is, anyhow.”\n\n“Indeed!” cried the astonished doctor, “and who is he?”\n\n“His name was Arnold Becker,” said the under-detective, “though he went\nby many aliases. He was a wandering sort of scamp, and is known to have\nbeen in America; so that was where Brayne got his knife into him. We\ndidn’t have much to do with him ourselves, for he worked mostly in\nGermany. We’ve communicated, of course, with the German police. But,\noddly enough, there was a twin brother of his, named Louis Becker,\nwhom we had a great deal to do with. In fact, we found it necessary to\nguillotine him only yesterday. Well, it’s a rum thing, gentlemen, but\nwhen I saw that fellow flat on the lawn I had the greatest jump of my\nlife. If I hadn’t seen Louis Becker guillotined with my own eyes,\nI’d have sworn it was Louis Becker lying there in the grass. Then, of\ncourse, I remembered his twin brother in Germany, and following up the\nclue--”\n\nThe explanatory Ivan stopped, for the excellent reason that nobody was\nlistening to him. The Commandant and the doctor were both staring at\nFather Brown, who had sprung stiffly to his feet, and was holding his\ntemples tight like a man in sudden and violent pain.\n\n“Stop, stop, stop!” he cried; “stop talking a minute, for I see half.\nWill God give me strength? Will my brain make the one jump and see all?\nHeaven help me! I used to be fairly good at thinking. I could paraphrase\nany page in Aquinas once. Will my head split--or will it see? I see\nhalf--I only see half.”\n\nHe buried his head in his hands, and stood in a sort of rigid torture\nof thought or prayer, while the other three could only go on staring at\nthis last prodigy of their wild twelve hours.\n\nWhen Father Brown’s hands fell they showed a face quite fresh and\nserious, like a child’s. He heaved a huge sigh, and said: “Let us get\nthis said and done with as quickly as possible. Look here, this will\nbe the quickest way to convince you all of the truth.” He turned to the\ndoctor. “Dr. Simon,” he said, “you have a strong head-piece, and I heard\nyou this morning asking the five hardest questions about this business.\nWell, if you will ask them again, I will answer them.”\n\nSimon’s pince-nez dropped from his nose in his doubt and wonder, but\nhe answered at once. “Well, the first question, you know, is why a man\nshould kill another with a clumsy sabre at all when a man can kill with\na bodkin?”\n\n“A man cannot behead with a bodkin,” said Brown calmly, “and for this\nmurder beheading was absolutely necessary.”\n\n“Why?” asked O’Brien, with interest.\n\n“And the next question?” asked Father Brown.\n\n“Well, why didn’t the man cry out or anything?” asked the doctor;\n“sabres in gardens are certainly unusual.”\n\n“Twigs,” said the priest gloomily, and turned to the window which looked\non the scene of death. “No one saw the point of the twigs. Why should\nthey lie on that lawn (look at it) so far from any tree? They were not\nsnapped off; they were chopped off. The murderer occupied his enemy\nwith some tricks with the sabre, showing how he could cut a branch in\nmid-air, or what-not. Then, while his enemy bent down to see the result,\na silent slash, and the head fell.”\n\n“Well,” said the doctor slowly, “that seems plausible enough. But my\nnext two questions will stump anyone.”\n\nThe priest still stood looking critically out of the window and waited.\n\n“You know how all the garden was sealed up like an air-tight chamber,”\n went on the doctor. “Well, how did the strange man get into the garden?”\n\nWithout turning round, the little priest answered: “There never was any\nstrange man in the garden.”\n\nThere was a silence, and then a sudden cackle of almost childish\nlaughter relieved the strain. The absurdity of Brown’s remark moved Ivan\nto open taunts.\n\n“Oh!” he cried; “then we didn’t lug a great fat corpse on to a sofa last\nnight? He hadn’t got into the garden, I suppose?”\n\n“Got into the garden?” repeated Brown reflectively. “No, not entirely.”\n\n“Hang it all,” cried Simon, “a man gets into a garden, or he doesn’t.”\n\n“Not necessarily,” said the priest, with a faint smile. “What is the\nnest question, doctor?”\n\n“I fancy you’re ill,” exclaimed Dr. Simon sharply; “but I’ll ask the\nnext question if you like. How did Brayne get out of the garden?”\n\n“He didn’t get out of the garden,” said the priest, still looking out of\nthe window.\n\n“Didn’t get out of the garden?” exploded Simon.\n\n“Not completely,” said Father Brown.\n\nSimon shook his fists in a frenzy of French logic. “A man gets out of a\ngarden, or he doesn’t,” he cried.\n\n“Not always,” said Father Brown.\n\nDr. Simon sprang to his feet impatiently. “I have no time to spare on\nsuch senseless talk,” he cried angrily. “If you can’t understand a man\nbeing on one side of a wall or the other, I won’t trouble you further.”\n\n“Doctor,” said the cleric very gently, “we have always got on very\npleasantly together. If only for the sake of old friendship, stop and\ntell me your fifth question.”\n\nThe impatient Simon sank into a chair by the door and said briefly: “The\nhead and shoulders were cut about in a queer way. It seemed to be done\nafter death.”\n\n“Yes,” said the motionless priest, “it was done so as to make you assume\nexactly the one simple falsehood that you did assume. It was done to\nmake you take for granted that the head belonged to the body.”\n\nThe borderland of the brain, where all the monsters are made, moved\nhorribly in the Gaelic O’Brien. He felt the chaotic presence of all\nthe horse-men and fish-women that man’s unnatural fancy has begotten. A\nvoice older than his first fathers seemed saying in his ear: “Keep out\nof the monstrous garden where grows the tree with double fruit. Avoid\nthe evil garden where died the man with two heads.” Yet, while these\nshameful symbolic shapes passed across the ancient mirror of his Irish\nsoul, his Frenchified intellect was quite alert, and was watching the\nodd priest as closely and incredulously as all the rest.\n\nFather Brown had turned round at last, and stood against the window,\nwith his face in dense shadow; but even in that shadow they could see\nit was pale as ashes. Nevertheless, he spoke quite sensibly, as if there\nwere no Gaelic souls on earth.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “you did not find the strange body of Becker in\nthe garden. You did not find any strange body in the garden. In face\nof Dr. Simon’s rationalism, I still affirm that Becker was only partly\npresent. Look here!” (pointing to the black bulk of the mysterious\ncorpse) “you never saw that man in your lives. Did you ever see this\nman?”\n\nHe rapidly rolled away the bald, yellow head of the unknown, and put in\nits place the white-maned head beside it. And there, complete, unified,\nunmistakable, lay Julius K. Brayne.\n\n“The murderer,” went on Brown quietly, “hacked off his enemy’s head and\nflung the sword far over the wall. But he was too clever to fling the\nsword only. He flung the head over the wall also. Then he had only to\nclap on another head to the corpse, and (as he insisted on a private\ninquest) you all imagined a totally new man.”\n\n“Clap on another head!” said O’Brien staring. “What other head? Heads\ndon’t grow on garden bushes, do they?”\n\n“No,” said Father Brown huskily, and looking at his boots; “there\nis only one place where they grow. They grow in the basket of the\nguillotine, beside which the chief of police, Aristide Valentin, was\nstanding not an hour before the murder. Oh, my friends, hear me a minute\nmore before you tear me in pieces. Valentin is an honest man, if being\nmad for an arguable cause is honesty. But did you never see in that\ncold, grey eye of his that he is mad! He would do anything, anything, to\nbreak what he calls the superstition of the Cross. He has fought for\nit and starved for it, and now he has murdered for it. Brayne’s crazy\nmillions had hitherto been scattered among so many sects that they did\nlittle to alter the balance of things. But Valentin heard a whisper that\nBrayne, like so many scatter-brained sceptics, was drifting to us; and\nthat was quite a different thing. Brayne would pour supplies into the\nimpoverished and pugnacious Church of France; he would support six\nNationalist newspapers like The Guillotine. The battle was already\nbalanced on a point, and the fanatic took flame at the risk. He resolved\nto destroy the millionaire, and he did it as one would expect the\ngreatest of detectives to commit his only crime. He abstracted the\nsevered head of Becker on some criminological excuse, and took it home\nin his official box. He had that last argument with Brayne, that Lord\nGalloway did not hear the end of; that failing, he led him out into the\nsealed garden, talked about swordsmanship, used twigs and a sabre for\nillustration, and--”\n\nIvan of the Scar sprang up. “You lunatic,” he yelled; “you’ll go to my\nmaster now, if I take you by--”\n\n“Why, I was going there,” said Brown heavily; “I must ask him to\nconfess, and all that.”\n\nDriving the unhappy Brown before them like a hostage or sacrifice, they\nrushed together into the sudden stillness of Valentin’s study.\n\nThe great detective sat at his desk apparently too occupied to hear\ntheir turbulent entrance. They paused a moment, and then something in\nthe look of that upright and elegant back made the doctor run forward\nsuddenly. A touch and a glance showed him that there was a small box of\npills at Valentin’s elbow, and that Valentin was dead in his chair; and\non the blind face of the suicide was more than the pride of Cato.\n\n\n\n\nThe Queer Feet\n\n\nIf you meet a member of that select club, “The Twelve True Fishermen,”\n entering the Vernon Hotel for the annual club dinner, you will observe,\nas he takes off his overcoat, that his evening coat is green and not\nblack. If (supposing that you have the star-defying audacity to address\nsuch a being) you ask him why, he will probably answer that he does it\nto avoid being mistaken for a waiter. You will then retire crushed. But\nyou will leave behind you a mystery as yet unsolved and a tale worth\ntelling.\n\nIf (to pursue the same vein of improbable conjecture) you were to meet\na mild, hard-working little priest, named Father Brown, and were to ask\nhim what he thought was the most singular luck of his life, he would\nprobably reply that upon the whole his best stroke was at the Vernon\nHotel, where he had averted a crime and, perhaps, saved a soul, merely\nby listening to a few footsteps in a passage. He is perhaps a little\nproud of this wild and wonderful guess of his, and it is possible that\nhe might refer to it. But since it is immeasurably unlikely that you\nwill ever rise high enough in the social world to find “The Twelve\nTrue Fishermen,” or that you will ever sink low enough among slums and\ncriminals to find Father Brown, I fear you will never hear the story at\nall unless you hear it from me.\n\nThe Vernon Hotel at which The Twelve True Fishermen held their annual\ndinners was an institution such as can only exist in an oligarchical\nsociety which has almost gone mad on good manners. It was that\ntopsy-turvy product--an “exclusive” commercial enterprise. That is, it\nwas a thing which paid not by attracting people, but actually by turning\npeople away. In the heart of a plutocracy tradesmen become cunning\nenough to be more fastidious than their customers. They positively\ncreate difficulties so that their wealthy and weary clients may spend\nmoney and diplomacy in overcoming them. If there were a fashionable\nhotel in London which no man could enter who was under six foot, society\nwould meekly make up parties of six-foot men to dine in it. If there\nwere an expensive restaurant which by a mere caprice of its proprietor\nwas only open on Thursday afternoon, it would be crowded on Thursday\nafternoon. The Vernon Hotel stood, as if by accident, in the corner of a\nsquare in Belgravia. It was a small hotel; and a very inconvenient\none. But its very inconveniences were considered as walls protecting a\nparticular class. One inconvenience, in particular, was held to be of\nvital importance: the fact that practically only twenty-four people\ncould dine in the place at once. The only big dinner table was the\ncelebrated terrace table, which stood open to the air on a sort of\nveranda overlooking one of the most exquisite old gardens in London.\nThus it happened that even the twenty-four seats at this table could\nonly be enjoyed in warm weather; and this making the enjoyment yet more\ndifficult made it yet more desired. The existing owner of the hotel was\na Jew named Lever; and he made nearly a million out of it, by making it\ndifficult to get into. Of course he combined with this limitation in the\nscope of his enterprise the most careful polish in its performance.\nThe wines and cooking were really as good as any in Europe, and the\ndemeanour of the attendants exactly mirrored the fixed mood of the\nEnglish upper class. The proprietor knew all his waiters like the\nfingers on his hand; there were only fifteen of them all told. It was\nmuch easier to become a Member of Parliament than to become a waiter in\nthat hotel. Each waiter was trained in terrible silence and smoothness,\nas if he were a gentleman’s servant. And, indeed, there was generally at\nleast one waiter to every gentleman who dined.\n\nThe club of The Twelve True Fishermen would not have consented to dine\nanywhere but in such a place, for it insisted on a luxurious privacy;\nand would have been quite upset by the mere thought that any other club\nwas even dining in the same building. On the occasion of their annual\ndinner the Fishermen were in the habit of exposing all their treasures,\nas if they were in a private house, especially the celebrated set\nof fish knives and forks which were, as it were, the insignia of the\nsociety, each being exquisitely wrought in silver in the form of a fish,\nand each loaded at the hilt with one large pearl. These were always\nlaid out for the fish course, and the fish course was always the most\nmagnificent in that magnificent repast. The society had a vast number\nof ceremonies and observances, but it had no history and no object; that\nwas where it was so very aristocratic. You did not have to be anything\nin order to be one of the Twelve Fishers; unless you were already a\ncertain sort of person, you never even heard of them. It had been in\nexistence twelve years. Its president was Mr. Audley. Its vice-president\nwas the Duke of Chester.\n\nIf I have in any degree conveyed the atmosphere of this appalling hotel,\nthe reader may feel a natural wonder as to how I came to know anything\nabout it, and may even speculate as to how so ordinary a person as my\nfriend Father Brown came to find himself in that golden galley. As far\nas that is concerned, my story is simple, or even vulgar. There is in\nthe world a very aged rioter and demagogue who breaks into the most\nrefined retreats with the dreadful information that all men are\nbrothers, and wherever this leveller went on his pale horse it was\nFather Brown’s trade to follow. One of the waiters, an Italian, had\nbeen struck down with a paralytic stroke that afternoon; and his Jewish\nemployer, marvelling mildly at such superstitions, had consented to send\nfor the nearest Popish priest. With what the waiter confessed to Father\nBrown we are not concerned, for the excellent reason that that cleric\nkept it to himself; but apparently it involved him in writing out a note\nor statement for the conveying of some message or the righting of some\nwrong. Father Brown, therefore, with a meek impudence which he would\nhave shown equally in Buckingham Palace, asked to be provided with a\nroom and writing materials. Mr. Lever was torn in two. He was a kind\nman, and had also that bad imitation of kindness, the dislike of any\ndifficulty or scene. At the same time the presence of one unusual\nstranger in his hotel that evening was like a speck of dirt on something\njust cleaned. There was never any borderland or anteroom in the Vernon\nHotel, no people waiting in the hall, no customers coming in on chance.\nThere were fifteen waiters. There were twelve guests. It would be as\nstartling to find a new guest in the hotel that night as to find a\nnew brother taking breakfast or tea in one’s own family. Moreover,\nthe priest’s appearance was second-rate and his clothes muddy; a mere\nglimpse of him afar off might precipitate a crisis in the club. Mr.\nLever at last hit on a plan to cover, since he might not obliterate, the\ndisgrace. When you enter (as you never will) the Vernon Hotel, you pass\ndown a short passage decorated with a few dingy but important pictures,\nand come to the main vestibule and lounge which opens on your right\ninto passages leading to the public rooms, and on your left to a similar\npassage pointing to the kitchens and offices of the hotel. Immediately\non your left hand is the corner of a glass office, which abuts upon\nthe lounge--a house within a house, so to speak, like the old hotel bar\nwhich probably once occupied its place.\n\nIn this office sat the representative of the proprietor (nobody in this\nplace ever appeared in person if he could help it), and just beyond the\noffice, on the way to the servants’ quarters, was the gentlemen’s cloak\nroom, the last boundary of the gentlemen’s domain. But between the\noffice and the cloak room was a small private room without other outlet,\nsometimes used by the proprietor for delicate and important matters,\nsuch as lending a duke a thousand pounds or declining to lend him\nsixpence. It is a mark of the magnificent tolerance of Mr. Lever that\nhe permitted this holy place to be for about half an hour profaned by a\nmere priest, scribbling away on a piece of paper. The story which Father\nBrown was writing down was very likely a much better story than this\none, only it will never be known. I can merely state that it was very\nnearly as long, and that the last two or three paragraphs of it were the\nleast exciting and absorbing.\n\nFor it was by the time that he had reached these that the priest began a\nlittle to allow his thoughts to wander and his animal senses, which were\ncommonly keen, to awaken. The time of darkness and dinner was drawing\non; his own forgotten little room was without a light, and perhaps the\ngathering gloom, as occasionally happens, sharpened the sense of sound.\nAs Father Brown wrote the last and least essential part of his document,\nhe caught himself writing to the rhythm of a recurrent noise outside,\njust as one sometimes thinks to the tune of a railway train. When he\nbecame conscious of the thing he found what it was: only the ordinary\npatter of feet passing the door, which in an hotel was no very unlikely\nmatter. Nevertheless, he stared at the darkened ceiling, and listened to\nthe sound. After he had listened for a few seconds dreamily, he got to\nhis feet and listened intently, with his head a little on one side.\nThen he sat down again and buried his brow in his hands, now not merely\nlistening, but listening and thinking also.\n\nThe footsteps outside at any given moment were such as one might hear in\nany hotel; and yet, taken as a whole, there was something very strange\nabout them. There were no other footsteps. It was always a very silent\nhouse, for the few familiar guests went at once to their own apartments,\nand the well-trained waiters were told to be almost invisible until\nthey were wanted. One could not conceive any place where there was less\nreason to apprehend anything irregular. But these footsteps were so\nodd that one could not decide to call them regular or irregular. Father\nBrown followed them with his finger on the edge of the table, like a man\ntrying to learn a tune on the piano.\n\nFirst, there came a long rush of rapid little steps, such as a light man\nmight make in winning a walking race. At a certain point they stopped\nand changed to a sort of slow, swinging stamp, numbering not a quarter\nof the steps, but occupying about the same time. The moment the last\nechoing stamp had died away would come again the run or ripple of light,\nhurrying feet, and then again the thud of the heavier walking. It was\ncertainly the same pair of boots, partly because (as has been said)\nthere were no other boots about, and partly because they had a small\nbut unmistakable creak in them. Father Brown had the kind of head that\ncannot help asking questions; and on this apparently trivial question\nhis head almost split. He had seen men run in order to jump. He had seen\nmen run in order to slide. But why on earth should a man run in order\nto walk? Or, again, why should he walk in order to run? Yet no other\ndescription would cover the antics of this invisible pair of legs. The\nman was either walking very fast down one-half of the corridor in order\nto walk very slow down the other half; or he was walking very slow\nat one end to have the rapture of walking fast at the other. Neither\nsuggestion seemed to make much sense. His brain was growing darker and\ndarker, like his room.\n\nYet, as he began to think steadily, the very blackness of his cell\nseemed to make his thoughts more vivid; he began to see as in a kind of\nvision the fantastic feet capering along the corridor in unnatural or\nsymbolic attitudes. Was it a heathen religious dance? Or some entirely\nnew kind of scientific exercise? Father Brown began to ask himself with\nmore exactness what the steps suggested. Taking the slow step first: it\ncertainly was not the step of the proprietor. Men of his type walk\nwith a rapid waddle, or they sit still. It could not be any servant or\nmessenger waiting for directions. It did not sound like it. The poorer\norders (in an oligarchy) sometimes lurch about when they are slightly\ndrunk, but generally, and especially in such gorgeous scenes, they stand\nor sit in constrained attitudes. No; that heavy yet springy step, with\na kind of careless emphasis, not specially noisy, yet not caring what\nnoise it made, belonged to only one of the animals of this earth. It was\na gentleman of western Europe, and probably one who had never worked for\nhis living.\n\nJust as he came to this solid certainty, the step changed to the quicker\none, and ran past the door as feverishly as a rat. The listener remarked\nthat though this step was much swifter it was also much more noiseless,\nalmost as if the man were walking on tiptoe. Yet it was not associated\nin his mind with secrecy, but with something else--something that he\ncould not remember. He was maddened by one of those half-memories that\nmake a man feel half-witted. Surely he had heard that strange, swift\nwalking somewhere. Suddenly he sprang to his feet with a new idea in\nhis head, and walked to the door. His room had no direct outlet on the\npassage, but let on one side into the glass office, and on the other\ninto the cloak room beyond. He tried the door into the office, and\nfound it locked. Then he looked at the window, now a square pane full of\npurple cloud cleft by livid sunset, and for an instant he smelt evil as\na dog smells rats.\n\nThe rational part of him (whether the wiser or not) regained its\nsupremacy. He remembered that the proprietor had told him that he should\nlock the door, and would come later to release him. He told himself that\ntwenty things he had not thought of might explain the eccentric sounds\noutside; he reminded himself that there was just enough light left to\nfinish his own proper work. Bringing his paper to the window so as to\ncatch the last stormy evening light, he resolutely plunged once more\ninto the almost completed record. He had written for about twenty\nminutes, bending closer and closer to his paper in the lessening light;\nthen suddenly he sat upright. He had heard the strange feet once more.\n\nThis time they had a third oddity. Previously the unknown man had\nwalked, with levity indeed and lightning quickness, but he had walked.\nThis time he ran. One could hear the swift, soft, bounding steps coming\nalong the corridor, like the pads of a fleeing and leaping panther.\nWhoever was coming was a very strong, active man, in still yet tearing\nexcitement. Yet, when the sound had swept up to the office like a sort\nof whispering whirlwind, it suddenly changed again to the old slow,\nswaggering stamp.\n\nFather Brown flung down his paper, and, knowing the office door to\nbe locked, went at once into the cloak room on the other side. The\nattendant of this place was temporarily absent, probably because the\nonly guests were at dinner and his office was a sinecure. After groping\nthrough a grey forest of overcoats, he found that the dim cloak room\nopened on the lighted corridor in the form of a sort of counter or\nhalf-door, like most of the counters across which we have all handed\numbrellas and received tickets. There was a light immediately above\nthe semicircular arch of this opening. It threw little illumination on\nFather Brown himself, who seemed a mere dark outline against the dim\nsunset window behind him. But it threw an almost theatrical light on the\nman who stood outside the cloak room in the corridor.\n\nHe was an elegant man in very plain evening dress; tall, but with an air\nof not taking up much room; one felt that he could have slid along like\na shadow where many smaller men would have been obvious and obstructive.\nHis face, now flung back in the lamplight, was swarthy and vivacious,\nthe face of a foreigner. His figure was good, his manners good humoured\nand confident; a critic could only say that his black coat was a shade\nbelow his figure and manners, and even bulged and bagged in an odd\nway. The moment he caught sight of Brown’s black silhouette against the\nsunset, he tossed down a scrap of paper with a number and called out\nwith amiable authority: “I want my hat and coat, please; I find I have\nto go away at once.”\n\nFather Brown took the paper without a word, and obediently went to look\nfor the coat; it was not the first menial work he had done in his\nlife. He brought it and laid it on the counter; meanwhile, the strange\ngentleman who had been feeling in his waistcoat pocket, said laughing:\n“I haven’t got any silver; you can keep this.” And he threw down half a\nsovereign, and caught up his coat.\n\nFather Brown’s figure remained quite dark and still; but in that instant\nhe had lost his head. His head was always most valuable when he had lost\nit. In such moments he put two and two together and made four million.\nOften the Catholic Church (which is wedded to common sense) did not\napprove of it. Often he did not approve of it himself. But it was real\ninspiration--important at rare crises--when whosoever shall lose his\nhead the same shall save it.\n\n“I think, sir,” he said civilly, “that you have some silver in your\npocket.”\n\nThe tall gentleman stared. “Hang it,” he cried, “if I choose to give you\ngold, why should you complain?”\n\n“Because silver is sometimes more valuable than gold,” said the priest\nmildly; “that is, in large quantities.”\n\nThe stranger looked at him curiously. Then he looked still more\ncuriously up the passage towards the main entrance. Then he looked back\nat Brown again, and then he looked very carefully at the window beyond\nBrown’s head, still coloured with the after-glow of the storm. Then he\nseemed to make up his mind. He put one hand on the counter, vaulted\nover as easily as an acrobat and towered above the priest, putting one\ntremendous hand upon his collar.\n\n“Stand still,” he said, in a hacking whisper. “I don’t want to threaten\nyou, but--”\n\n“I do want to threaten you,” said Father Brown, in a voice like a\nrolling drum, “I want to threaten you with the worm that dieth not, and\nthe fire that is not quenched.”\n\n“You’re a rum sort of cloak-room clerk,” said the other.\n\n“I am a priest, Monsieur Flambeau,” said Brown, “and I am ready to hear\nyour confession.”\n\nThe other stood gasping for a few moments, and then staggered back into\na chair.\n\nThe first two courses of the dinner of The Twelve True Fishermen had\nproceeded with placid success. I do not possess a copy of the menu; and\nif I did it would not convey anything to anybody. It was written in\na sort of super-French employed by cooks, but quite unintelligible to\nFrenchmen. There was a tradition in the club that the hors d’oeuvres\nshould be various and manifold to the point of madness. They were taken\nseriously because they were avowedly useless extras, like the whole\ndinner and the whole club. There was also a tradition that the soup\ncourse should be light and unpretending--a sort of simple and austere\nvigil for the feast of fish that was to come. The talk was that strange,\nslight talk which governs the British Empire, which governs it in\nsecret, and yet would scarcely enlighten an ordinary Englishman even if\nhe could overhear it. Cabinet ministers on both sides were alluded to\nby their Christian names with a sort of bored benignity. The Radical\nChancellor of the Exchequer, whom the whole Tory party was supposed to\nbe cursing for his extortions, was praised for his minor poetry, or his\nsaddle in the hunting field. The Tory leader, whom all Liberals\nwere supposed to hate as a tyrant, was discussed and, on the whole,\npraised--as a Liberal. It seemed somehow that politicians were very\nimportant. And yet, anything seemed important about them except their\npolitics. Mr. Audley, the chairman, was an amiable, elderly man who\nstill wore Gladstone collars; he was a kind of symbol of all that\nphantasmal and yet fixed society. He had never done anything--not even\nanything wrong. He was not fast; he was not even particularly rich.\nHe was simply in the thing; and there was an end of it. No party could\nignore him, and if he had wished to be in the Cabinet he certainly would\nhave been put there. The Duke of Chester, the vice-president, was a\nyoung and rising politician. That is to say, he was a pleasant youth,\nwith flat, fair hair and a freckled face, with moderate intelligence and\nenormous estates. In public his appearances were always successful and\nhis principle was simple enough. When he thought of a joke he made it,\nand was called brilliant. When he could not think of a joke he said that\nthis was no time for trifling, and was called able. In private, in a\nclub of his own class, he was simply quite pleasantly frank and silly,\nlike a schoolboy. Mr. Audley, never having been in politics, treated\nthem a little more seriously. Sometimes he even embarrassed the company\nby phrases suggesting that there was some difference between a Liberal\nand a Conservative. He himself was a Conservative, even in private life.\nHe had a roll of grey hair over the back of his collar, like certain\nold-fashioned statesmen, and seen from behind he looked like the man the\nempire wants. Seen from the front he looked like a mild, self-indulgent\nbachelor, with rooms in the Albany--which he was.\n\nAs has been remarked, there were twenty-four seats at the terrace table,\nand only twelve members of the club. Thus they could occupy the terrace\nin the most luxurious style of all, being ranged along the inner side of\nthe table, with no one opposite, commanding an uninterrupted view of\nthe garden, the colours of which were still vivid, though evening was\nclosing in somewhat luridly for the time of year. The chairman sat in\nthe centre of the line, and the vice-president at the right-hand end\nof it. When the twelve guests first trooped into their seats it was the\ncustom (for some unknown reason) for all the fifteen waiters to stand\nlining the wall like troops presenting arms to the king, while the fat\nproprietor stood and bowed to the club with radiant surprise, as if he\nhad never heard of them before. But before the first chink of knife and\nfork this army of retainers had vanished, only the one or two required\nto collect and distribute the plates darting about in deathly silence.\nMr. Lever, the proprietor, of course had disappeared in convulsions of\ncourtesy long before. It would be exaggerative, indeed irreverent,\nto say that he ever positively appeared again. But when the important\ncourse, the fish course, was being brought on, there was--how shall I\nput it?--a vivid shadow, a projection of his personality, which told\nthat he was hovering near. The sacred fish course consisted (to the eyes\nof the vulgar) in a sort of monstrous pudding, about the size and shape\nof a wedding cake, in which some considerable number of interesting\nfishes had finally lost the shapes which God had given to them. The\nTwelve True Fishermen took up their celebrated fish knives and fish\nforks, and approached it as gravely as if every inch of the pudding cost\nas much as the silver fork it was eaten with. So it did, for all I know.\nThis course was dealt with in eager and devouring silence; and it was\nonly when his plate was nearly empty that the young duke made the ritual\nremark: “They can’t do this anywhere but here.”\n\n“Nowhere,” said Mr. Audley, in a deep bass voice, turning to the speaker\nand nodding his venerable head a number of times. “Nowhere, assuredly,\nexcept here. It was represented to me that at the Cafe Anglais--”\n\nHere he was interrupted and even agitated for a moment by the removal\nof his plate, but he recaptured the valuable thread of his thoughts. “It\nwas represented to me that the same could be done at the Cafe Anglais.\nNothing like it, sir,” he said, shaking his head ruthlessly, like a\nhanging judge. “Nothing like it.”\n\n“Overrated place,” said a certain Colonel Pound, speaking (by the look\nof him) for the first time for some months.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know,” said the Duke of Chester, who was an optimist, “it’s\njolly good for some things. You can’t beat it at--”\n\nA waiter came swiftly along the room, and then stopped dead. His\nstoppage was as silent as his tread; but all those vague and kindly\ngentlemen were so used to the utter smoothness of the unseen machinery\nwhich surrounded and supported their lives, that a waiter doing anything\nunexpected was a start and a jar. They felt as you and I would feel if\nthe inanimate world disobeyed--if a chair ran away from us.\n\nThe waiter stood staring a few seconds, while there deepened on every\nface at table a strange shame which is wholly the product of our time.\nIt is the combination of modern humanitarianism with the horrible\nmodern abyss between the souls of the rich and poor. A genuine historic\naristocrat would have thrown things at the waiter, beginning with empty\nbottles, and very probably ending with money. A genuine democrat would\nhave asked him, with comrade-like clearness of speech, what the devil he\nwas doing. But these modern plutocrats could not bear a poor man near\nto them, either as a slave or as a friend. That something had gone wrong\nwith the servants was merely a dull, hot embarrassment. They did not\nwant to be brutal, and they dreaded the need to be benevolent. They\nwanted the thing, whatever it was, to be over. It was over. The waiter,\nafter standing for some seconds rigid, like a cataleptic, turned round\nand ran madly out of the room.\n\nWhen he reappeared in the room, or rather in the doorway, it was in\ncompany with another waiter, with whom he whispered and gesticulated\nwith southern fierceness. Then the first waiter went away, leaving the\nsecond waiter, and reappeared with a third waiter. By the time a fourth\nwaiter had joined this hurried synod, Mr. Audley felt it necessary to\nbreak the silence in the interests of Tact. He used a very loud cough,\ninstead of a presidential hammer, and said: “Splendid work young\nMoocher’s doing in Burmah. Now, no other nation in the world could\nhave--”\n\nA fifth waiter had sped towards him like an arrow, and was whispering in\nhis ear: “So sorry. Important! Might the proprietor speak to you?”\n\nThe chairman turned in disorder, and with a dazed stare saw Mr. Lever\ncoming towards them with his lumbering quickness. The gait of the good\nproprietor was indeed his usual gait, but his face was by no means\nusual. Generally it was a genial copper-brown; now it was a sickly\nyellow.\n\n“You will pardon me, Mr. Audley,” he said, with asthmatic\nbreathlessness. “I have great apprehensions. Your fish-plates, they are\ncleared away with the knife and fork on them!”\n\n“Well, I hope so,” said the chairman, with some warmth.\n\n“You see him?” panted the excited hotel keeper; “you see the waiter who\ntook them away? You know him?”\n\n“Know the waiter?” answered Mr. Audley indignantly. “Certainly not!”\n\nMr. Lever opened his hands with a gesture of agony. “I never send him,”\n he said. “I know not when or why he come. I send my waiter to take away\nthe plates, and he find them already away.”\n\nMr. Audley still looked rather too bewildered to be really the man the\nempire wants; none of the company could say anything except the man of\nwood--Colonel Pound--who seemed galvanised into an unnatural life. He\nrose rigidly from his chair, leaving all the rest sitting, screwed his\neyeglass into his eye, and spoke in a raucous undertone as if he had\nhalf-forgotten how to speak. “Do you mean,” he said, “that somebody has\nstolen our silver fish service?”\n\nThe proprietor repeated the open-handed gesture with even greater\nhelplessness and in a flash all the men at the table were on their feet.\n\n“Are all your waiters here?” demanded the colonel, in his low, harsh\naccent.\n\n“Yes; they’re all here. I noticed it myself,” cried the young duke,\npushing his boyish face into the inmost ring. “Always count ‘em as I\ncome in; they look so queer standing up against the wall.”\n\n“But surely one cannot exactly remember,” began Mr. Audley, with heavy\nhesitation.\n\n“I remember exactly, I tell you,” cried the duke excitedly. “There never\nhave been more than fifteen waiters at this place, and there were no\nmore than fifteen tonight, I’ll swear; no more and no less.”\n\nThe proprietor turned upon him, quaking in a kind of palsy of surprise.\n“You say--you say,” he stammered, “that you see all my fifteen waiters?”\n\n“As usual,” assented the duke. “What is the matter with that!”\n\n“Nothing,” said Lever, with a deepening accent, “only you did not. For\none of zem is dead upstairs.”\n\nThere was a shocking stillness for an instant in that room. It may be\n(so supernatural is the word death) that each of those idle men looked\nfor a second at his soul, and saw it as a small dried pea. One of\nthem--the duke, I think--even said with the idiotic kindness of wealth:\n“Is there anything we can do?”\n\n“He has had a priest,” said the Jew, not untouched.\n\nThen, as to the clang of doom, they awoke to their own position. For a\nfew weird seconds they had really felt as if the fifteenth waiter might\nbe the ghost of the dead man upstairs. They had been dumb under that\noppression, for ghosts were to them an embarrassment, like beggars. But\nthe remembrance of the silver broke the spell of the miraculous; broke\nit abruptly and with a brutal reaction. The colonel flung over his chair\nand strode to the door. “If there was a fifteenth man here, friends,” he\nsaid, “that fifteenth fellow was a thief. Down at once to the front\nand back doors and secure everything; then we’ll talk. The twenty-four\npearls of the club are worth recovering.”\n\nMr. Audley seemed at first to hesitate about whether it was gentlemanly\nto be in such a hurry about anything; but, seeing the duke dash down the\nstairs with youthful energy, he followed with a more mature motion.\n\nAt the same instant a sixth waiter ran into the room, and declared that\nhe had found the pile of fish plates on a sideboard, with no trace of\nthe silver.\n\nThe crowd of diners and attendants that tumbled helter-skelter down the\npassages divided into two groups. Most of the Fishermen followed the\nproprietor to the front room to demand news of any exit. Colonel Pound,\nwith the chairman, the vice-president, and one or two others darted down\nthe corridor leading to the servants’ quarters, as the more likely line\nof escape. As they did so they passed the dim alcove or cavern of\nthe cloak room, and saw a short, black-coated figure, presumably an\nattendant, standing a little way back in the shadow of it.\n\n“Hallo, there!” called out the duke. “Have you seen anyone pass?”\n\nThe short figure did not answer the question directly, but merely said:\n“Perhaps I have got what you are looking for, gentlemen.”\n\nThey paused, wavering and wondering, while he quietly went to the back\nof the cloak room, and came back with both hands full of shining silver,\nwhich he laid out on the counter as calmly as a salesman. It took the\nform of a dozen quaintly shaped forks and knives.\n\n“You--you--” began the colonel, quite thrown off his balance at last.\nThen he peered into the dim little room and saw two things: first, that\nthe short, black-clad man was dressed like a clergyman; and, second,\nthat the window of the room behind him was burst, as if someone had\npassed violently through. “Valuable things to deposit in a cloak room,\naren’t they?” remarked the clergyman, with cheerful composure.\n\n“Did--did you steal those things?” stammered Mr. Audley, with staring\neyes.\n\n“If I did,” said the cleric pleasantly, “at least I am bringing them\nback again.”\n\n“But you didn’t,” said Colonel Pound, still staring at the broken\nwindow.\n\n“To make a clean breast of it, I didn’t,” said the other, with some\nhumour. And he seated himself quite gravely on a stool. “But you know\nwho did,” said the, colonel.\n\n“I don’t know his real name,” said the priest placidly, “but I know\nsomething of his fighting weight, and a great deal about his spiritual\ndifficulties. I formed the physical estimate when he was trying to\nthrottle me, and the moral estimate when he repented.”\n\n“Oh, I say--repented!” cried young Chester, with a sort of crow of\nlaughter.\n\nFather Brown got to his feet, putting his hands behind him. “Odd, isn’t\nit,” he said, “that a thief and a vagabond should repent, when so many\nwho are rich and secure remain hard and frivolous, and without fruit for\nGod or man? But there, if you will excuse me, you trespass a little upon\nmy province. If you doubt the penitence as a practical fact, there are\nyour knives and forks. You are The Twelve True Fishers, and there are\nall your silver fish. But He has made me a fisher of men.”\n\n“Did you catch this man?” asked the colonel, frowning.\n\nFather Brown looked him full in his frowning face. “Yes,” he said, “I\ncaught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long\nenough to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring\nhim back with a twitch upon the thread.”\n\nThere was a long silence. All the other men present drifted away\nto carry the recovered silver to their comrades, or to consult the\nproprietor about the queer condition of affairs. But the grim-faced\ncolonel still sat sideways on the counter, swinging his long, lank legs\nand biting his dark moustache.\n\nAt last he said quietly to the priest: “He must have been a clever\nfellow, but I think I know a cleverer.”\n\n“He was a clever fellow,” answered the other, “but I am not quite sure\nof what other you mean.”\n\n“I mean you,” said the colonel, with a short laugh. “I don’t want to get\nthe fellow jailed; make yourself easy about that. But I’d give a good\nmany silver forks to know exactly how you fell into this affair, and how\nyou got the stuff out of him. I reckon you’re the most up-to-date devil\nof the present company.”\n\nFather Brown seemed rather to like the saturnine candour of the soldier.\n“Well,” he said, smiling, “I mustn’t tell you anything of the man’s\nidentity, or his own story, of course; but there’s no particular reason\nwhy I shouldn’t tell you of the mere outside facts which I found out for\nmyself.”\n\nHe hopped over the barrier with unexpected activity, and sat beside\nColonel Pound, kicking his short legs like a little boy on a gate. He\nbegan to tell the story as easily as if he were telling it to an old\nfriend by a Christmas fire.\n\n“You see, colonel,” he said, “I was shut up in that small room there\ndoing some writing, when I heard a pair of feet in this passage doing a\ndance that was as queer as the dance of death. First came quick, funny\nlittle steps, like a man walking on tiptoe for a wager; then came slow,\ncareless, creaking steps, as of a big man walking about with a cigar.\nBut they were both made by the same feet, I swear, and they came in\nrotation; first the run and then the walk, and then the run again. I\nwondered at first idly and then wildly why a man should act these two\nparts at once. One walk I knew; it was just like yours, colonel. It\nwas the walk of a well-fed gentleman waiting for something, who strolls\nabout rather because he is physically alert than because he is mentally\nimpatient. I knew that I knew the other walk, too, but I could not\nremember what it was. What wild creature had I met on my travels that\ntore along on tiptoe in that extraordinary style? Then I heard a clink\nof plates somewhere; and the answer stood up as plain as St. Peter’s. It\nwas the walk of a waiter--that walk with the body slanted forward, the\neyes looking down, the ball of the toe spurning away the ground, the\ncoat tails and napkin flying. Then I thought for a minute and a half\nmore. And I believe I saw the manner of the crime, as clearly as if I\nwere going to commit it.”\n\nColonel Pound looked at him keenly, but the speaker’s mild grey eyes\nwere fixed upon the ceiling with almost empty wistfulness.\n\n“A crime,” he said slowly, “is like any other work of art. Don’t look\nsurprised; crimes are by no means the only works of art that come from\nan infernal workshop. But every work of art, divine or diabolic, has\none indispensable mark--I mean, that the centre of it is simple, however\nmuch the fulfilment may be complicated. Thus, in Hamlet, let us say,\nthe grotesqueness of the grave-digger, the flowers of the mad girl, the\nfantastic finery of Osric, the pallor of the ghost and the grin of\nthe skull are all oddities in a sort of tangled wreath round one plain\ntragic figure of a man in black. Well, this also,” he said, getting\nslowly down from his seat with a smile, “this also is the plain tragedy\nof a man in black. Yes,” he went on, seeing the colonel look up in some\nwonder, “the whole of this tale turns on a black coat. In this, as in\nHamlet, there are the rococo excrescences--yourselves, let us say. There\nis the dead waiter, who was there when he could not be there. There is\nthe invisible hand that swept your table clear of silver and melted\ninto air. But every clever crime is founded ultimately on some one quite\nsimple fact--some fact that is not itself mysterious. The mystification\ncomes in covering it up, in leading men’s thoughts away from it. This\nlarge and subtle and (in the ordinary course) most profitable crime, was\nbuilt on the plain fact that a gentleman’s evening dress is the same as\na waiter’s. All the rest was acting, and thundering good acting, too.”\n\n“Still,” said the colonel, getting up and frowning at his boots, “I am\nnot sure that I understand.”\n\n“Colonel,” said Father Brown, “I tell you that this archangel of\nimpudence who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty\ntimes in the blaze of all the lamps, in the glare of all the eyes. He\ndid not go and hide in dim corners where suspicion might have searched\nfor him. He kept constantly on the move in the lighted corridors, and\neverywhere that he went he seemed to be there by right. Don’t ask me\nwhat he was like; you have seen him yourself six or seven times tonight.\nYou were waiting with all the other grand people in the reception room\nat the end of the passage there, with the terrace just beyond. Whenever\nhe came among you gentlemen, he came in the lightning style of a waiter,\nwith bent head, flapping napkin and flying feet. He shot out on to the\nterrace, did something to the table cloth, and shot back again towards\nthe office and the waiters’ quarters. By the time he had come under the\neye of the office clerk and the waiters he had become another man in\nevery inch of his body, in every instinctive gesture. He strolled among\nthe servants with the absent-minded insolence which they have all seen\nin their patrons. It was no new thing to them that a swell from the\ndinner party should pace all parts of the house like an animal at the\nZoo; they know that nothing marks the Smart Set more than a habit of\nwalking where one chooses. When he was magnificently weary of walking\ndown that particular passage he would wheel round and pace back past\nthe office; in the shadow of the arch just beyond he was altered as by\na blast of magic, and went hurrying forward again among the Twelve\nFishermen, an obsequious attendant. Why should the gentlemen look at\na chance waiter? Why should the waiters suspect a first-rate walking\ngentleman? Once or twice he played the coolest tricks. In the\nproprietor’s private quarters he called out breezily for a syphon of\nsoda water, saying he was thirsty. He said genially that he would carry\nit himself, and he did; he carried it quickly and correctly through the\nthick of you, a waiter with an obvious errand. Of course, it could not\nhave been kept up long, but it only had to be kept up till the end of\nthe fish course.\n\n“His worst moment was when the waiters stood in a row; but even then he\ncontrived to lean against the wall just round the corner in such a way\nthat for that important instant the waiters thought him a gentleman,\nwhile the gentlemen thought him a waiter. The rest went like winking. If\nany waiter caught him away from the table, that waiter caught a languid\naristocrat. He had only to time himself two minutes before the fish was\ncleared, become a swift servant, and clear it himself. He put the plates\ndown on a sideboard, stuffed the silver in his breast pocket, giving it\na bulgy look, and ran like a hare (I heard him coming) till he came to\nthe cloak room. There he had only to be a plutocrat again--a plutocrat\ncalled away suddenly on business. He had only to give his ticket to\nthe cloak-room attendant, and go out again elegantly as he had come in.\nOnly--only I happened to be the cloak-room attendant.”\n\n“What did you do to him?” cried the colonel, with unusual intensity.\n“What did he tell you?”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said the priest immovably, “that is where the story\nends.”\n\n“And the interesting story begins,” muttered Pound. “I think I\nunderstand his professional trick. But I don’t seem to have got hold of\nyours.”\n\n“I must be going,” said Father Brown.\n\nThey walked together along the passage to the entrance hall, where they\nsaw the fresh, freckled face of the Duke of Chester, who was bounding\nbuoyantly along towards them.\n\n“Come along, Pound,” he cried breathlessly. “I’ve been looking for you\neverywhere. The dinner’s going again in spanking style, and old Audley\nhas got to make a speech in honour of the forks being saved. We want to\nstart some new ceremony, don’t you know, to commemorate the occasion. I\nsay, you really got the goods back, what do you suggest?”\n\n“Why,” said the colonel, eyeing him with a certain sardonic approval, “I\nshould suggest that henceforward we wear green coats, instead of\nblack. One never knows what mistakes may arise when one looks so like a\nwaiter.”\n\n“Oh, hang it all!” said the young man, “a gentleman never looks like a\nwaiter.”\n\n“Nor a waiter like a gentleman, I suppose,” said Colonel Pound, with the\nsame lowering laughter on his face. “Reverend sir, your friend must have\nbeen very smart to act the gentleman.”\n\nFather Brown buttoned up his commonplace overcoat to the neck, for the\nnight was stormy, and took his commonplace umbrella from the stand.\n\n“Yes,” he said; “it must be very hard work to be a gentleman; but, do\nyou know, I have sometimes thought that it may be almost as laborious to\nbe a waiter.”\n\nAnd saying “Good evening,” he pushed open the heavy doors of that palace\nof pleasures. The golden gates closed behind him, and he went at a brisk\nwalk through the damp, dark streets in search of a penny omnibus.\n\n\n\n\nThe Flying Stars\n\n\n“The most beautiful crime I ever committed,” Flambeau would say in his\nhighly moral old age, “was also, by a singular coincidence, my last.\nIt was committed at Christmas. As an artist I had always attempted to\nprovide crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which I\nfound myself, choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe,\nas if for a statuary group. Thus squires should be swindled in long\nrooms panelled with oak; while Jews, on the other hand, should rather\nfind themselves unexpectedly penniless among the lights and screens of\nthe Cafe Riche. Thus, in England, if I wished to relieve a dean of his\nriches (which is not so easy as you might suppose), I wished to frame\nhim, if I make myself clear, in the green lawns and grey towers of some\ncathedral town. Similarly, in France, when I had got money out of a rich\nand wicked peasant (which is almost impossible), it gratified me to get\nhis indignant head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars,\nand those solemn plains of Gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of\nMillet.\n\n“Well, my last crime was a Christmas crime, a cheery, cosy, English\nmiddle-class crime; a crime of Charles Dickens. I did it in a good old\nmiddle-class house near Putney, a house with a crescent of carriage\ndrive, a house with a stable by the side of it, a house with the name\non the two outer gates, a house with a monkey tree. Enough, you know the\nspecies. I really think my imitation of Dickens’s style was dexterous\nand literary. It seems almost a pity I repented the same evening.”\n\nFlambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside; and\neven from the inside it was odd. Seen from the outside it was perfectly\nincomprehensible, and it is from the outside that the stranger must\nstudy it. From this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when\nthe front doors of the house with the stable opened on the garden with\nthe monkey tree, and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds\non the afternoon of Boxing Day. She had a pretty face, with brave brown\neyes; but her figure was beyond conjecture, for she was so wrapped up in\nbrown furs that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur. But\nfor the attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear.\n\nThe winter afternoon was reddening towards evening, and already a ruby\nlight was rolled over the bloomless beds, filling them, as it were, with\nthe ghosts of the dead roses. On one side of the house stood the stable,\non the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden\nbehind. The young lady, having scattered bread for the birds (for\nthe fourth or fifth time that day, because the dog ate it), passed\nunobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation\nof evergreens behind. Here she gave an exclamation of wonder, real or\nritual, and looking up at the high garden wall above her, beheld it\nfantastically bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure.\n\n“Oh, don’t jump, Mr. Crook,” she called out in some alarm; “it’s much\ntoo high.”\n\nThe individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse was a tall,\nangular young man, with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush,\nintelligent and even distinguished lineaments, but a sallow and almost\nalien complexion. This showed the more plainly because he wore an\naggressive red tie, the only part of his costume of which he seemed to\ntake any care. Perhaps it was a symbol. He took no notice of the girl’s\nalarmed adjuration, but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside\nher, where he might very well have broken his legs.\n\n“I think I was meant to be a burglar,” he said placidly, “and I have no\ndoubt I should have been if I hadn’t happened to be born in that nice\nhouse next door. I can’t see any harm in it, anyhow.”\n\n“How can you say such things!” she remonstrated.\n\n“Well,” said the young man, “if you’re born on the wrong side of the\nwall, I can’t see that it’s wrong to climb over it.”\n\n“I never know what you will say or do next,” she said.\n\n“I don’t often know myself,” replied Mr. Crook; “but then I am on the\nright side of the wall now.”\n\n“And which is the right side of the wall?” asked the young lady,\nsmiling.\n\n“Whichever side you are on,” said the young man named Crook.\n\nAs they went together through the laurels towards the front garden\na motor horn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of\nsplendid speed, great elegance, and a pale green colour swept up to the\nfront doors like a bird and stood throbbing.\n\n“Hullo, hullo!” said the young man with the red tie, “here’s somebody\nborn on the right side, anyhow. I didn’t know, Miss Adams, that your\nSanta Claus was so modern as this.”\n\n“Oh, that’s my godfather, Sir Leopold Fischer. He always comes on Boxing\nDay.”\n\nThen, after an innocent pause, which unconsciously betrayed some lack of\nenthusiasm, Ruby Adams added:\n\n“He is very kind.”\n\nJohn Crook, journalist, had heard of that eminent City magnate; and\nit was not his fault if the City magnate had not heard of him; for in\ncertain articles in The Clarion or The New Age Sir Leopold had been\ndealt with austerely. But he said nothing and grimly watched the\nunloading of the motor-car, which was rather a long process. A large,\nneat chauffeur in green got out from the front, and a small, neat\nmanservant in grey got out from the back, and between them they\ndeposited Sir Leopold on the doorstep and began to unpack him, like some\nvery carefully protected parcel. Rugs enough to stock a bazaar, furs\nof all the beasts of the forest, and scarves of all the colours of\nthe rainbow were unwrapped one by one, till they revealed something\nresembling the human form; the form of a friendly, but foreign-looking\nold gentleman, with a grey goat-like beard and a beaming smile, who\nrubbed his big fur gloves together.\n\nLong before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch\nhad opened in the middle, and Colonel Adams (father of the furry young\nlady) had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside. He was a\ntall, sunburnt, and very silent man, who wore a red smoking-cap like a\nfez, making him look like one of the English Sirdars or Pashas in Egypt.\nWith him was his brother-in-law, lately come from Canada, a big and\nrather boisterous young gentleman-farmer, with a yellow beard, by name\nJames Blount. With him also was the more insignificant figure of the\npriest from the neighbouring Roman Church; for the colonel’s late wife\nhad been a Catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had\nbeen trained to follow her. Everything seemed undistinguished about\nthe priest, even down to his name, which was Brown; yet the colonel had\nalways found something companionable about him, and frequently asked him\nto such family gatherings.\n\nIn the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for\nSir Leopold and the removal of his wraps. Porch and vestibule, indeed,\nwere unduly large in proportion to the house, and formed, as it were, a\nbig room with the front door at one end, and the bottom of the staircase\nat the other. In front of the large hall fire, over which hung the\ncolonel’s sword, the process was completed and the company, including\nthe saturnine Crook, presented to Sir Leopold Fischer. That venerable\nfinancier, however, still seemed struggling with portions of his\nwell-lined attire, and at length produced from a very interior tail-coat\npocket, a black oval case which he radiantly explained to be his\nChristmas present for his god-daughter. With an unaffected vain-glory\nthat had something disarming about it he held out the case before them\nall; it flew open at a touch and half-blinded them. It was just as if a\ncrystal fountain had spurted in their eyes. In a nest of orange velvet\nlay like three eggs, three white and vivid diamonds that seemed to set\nthe very air on fire all round them. Fischer stood beaming benevolently\nand drinking deep of the astonishment and ecstasy of the girl, the grim\nadmiration and gruff thanks of the colonel, the wonder of the whole\ngroup.\n\n“I’ll put ‘em back now, my dear,” said Fischer, returning the case to\nthe tails of his coat. “I had to be careful of ‘em coming down. They’re\nthe three great African diamonds called ‘The Flying Stars,’ because\nthey’ve been stolen so often. All the big criminals are on the track;\nbut even the rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have\nkept their hands off them. I might have lost them on the road here. It\nwas quite possible.”\n\n“Quite natural, I should say,” growled the man in the red tie. “I\nshouldn’t blame ‘em if they had taken ‘em. When they ask for bread, and\nyou don’t even give them a stone, I think they might take the stone for\nthemselves.”\n\n“I won’t have you talking like that,” cried the girl, who was in a\ncurious glow. “You’ve only talked like that since you became a horrid\nwhat’s-his-name. You know what I mean. What do you call a man who wants\nto embrace the chimney-sweep?”\n\n“A saint,” said Father Brown.\n\n“I think,” said Sir Leopold, with a supercilious smile, “that Ruby means\na Socialist.”\n\n“A radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes,” remarked Crook,\nwith some impatience; “and a Conservative does not mean a man who\npreserves jam. Neither, I assure you, does a Socialist mean a man who\ndesires a social evening with the chimney-sweep. A Socialist means a\nman who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney-sweeps paid for\nit.”\n\n“But who won’t allow you,” put in the priest in a low voice, “to own\nyour own soot.”\n\nCrook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect. “Does one\nwant to own soot?” he asked.\n\n“One might,” answered Brown, with speculation in his eye. “I’ve heard\nthat gardeners use it. And I once made six children happy at Christmas\nwhen the conjuror didn’t come, entirely with soot--applied externally.”\n\n“Oh, splendid,” cried Ruby. “Oh, I wish you’d do it to this company.”\n\nThe boisterous Canadian, Mr. Blount, was lifting his loud voice in\napplause, and the astonished financier his (in some considerable\ndeprecation), when a knock sounded at the double front doors. The priest\nopened them, and they showed again the front garden of evergreens,\nmonkey-tree and all, now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet\nsunset. The scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint, like a back\nscene in a play, that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure\nstanding in the door. He was dusty-looking and in a frayed coat,\nevidently a common messenger. “Any of you gentlemen Mr. Blount?” he\nasked, and held forward a letter doubtfully. Mr. Blount started, and\nstopped in his shout of assent. Ripping up the envelope with evident\nastonishment he read it; his face clouded a little, and then cleared,\nand he turned to his brother-in-law and host.\n\n“I’m sick at being such a nuisance, colonel,” he said, with the cheery\ncolonial conventions; “but would it upset you if an old acquaintance\ncalled on me here tonight on business? In point of fact it’s Florian,\nthat famous French acrobat and comic actor; I knew him years ago out\nWest (he was a French-Canadian by birth), and he seems to have business\nfor me, though I hardly guess what.”\n\n“Of course, of course,” replied the colonel carelessly--“My dear chap,\nany friend of yours. No doubt he will prove an acquisition.”\n\n“He’ll black his face, if that’s what you mean,” cried Blount, laughing.\n“I don’t doubt he’d black everyone else’s eyes. I don’t care; I’m not\nrefined. I like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top\nhat.”\n\n“Not on mine, please,” said Sir Leopold Fischer, with dignity.\n\n“Well, well,” observed Crook, airily, “don’t let’s quarrel. There are\nlower jokes than sitting on a top hat.”\n\nDislike of the red-tied youth, born of his predatory opinions and\nevident intimacy with the pretty godchild, led Fischer to say, in his\nmost sarcastic, magisterial manner: “No doubt you have found something\nmuch lower than sitting on a top hat. What is it, pray?”\n\n“Letting a top hat sit on you, for instance,” said the Socialist.\n\n“Now, now, now,” cried the Canadian farmer with his barbarian\nbenevolence, “don’t let’s spoil a jolly evening. What I say is, let’s\ndo something for the company tonight. Not blacking faces or sitting on\nhats, if you don’t like those--but something of the sort. Why couldn’t\nwe have a proper old English pantomime--clown, columbine, and so on. I\nsaw one when I left England at twelve years old, and it’s blazed in my\nbrain like a bonfire ever since. I came back to the old country\nonly last year, and I find the thing’s extinct. Nothing but a lot of\nsnivelling fairy plays. I want a hot poker and a policeman made into\nsausages, and they give me princesses moralising by moonlight, Blue\nBirds, or something. Blue Beard’s more in my line, and him I like best\nwhen he turned into the pantaloon.”\n\n“I’m all for making a policeman into sausages,” said John Crook. “It’s a\nbetter definition of Socialism than some recently given. But surely the\nget-up would be too big a business.”\n\n“Not a scrap,” cried Blount, quite carried away. “A harlequinade’s the\nquickest thing we can do, for two reasons. First, one can gag to any\ndegree; and, second, all the objects are household things--tables and\ntowel-horses and washing baskets, and things like that.”\n\n“That’s true,” admitted Crook, nodding eagerly and walking about.\n“But I’m afraid I can’t have my policeman’s uniform? Haven’t killed a\npoliceman lately.”\n\nBlount frowned thoughtfully a space, and then smote his thigh. “Yes,\nwe can!” he cried. “I’ve got Florian’s address here, and he knows every\ncostumier in London. I’ll phone him to bring a police dress when he\ncomes.” And he went bounding away to the telephone.\n\n“Oh, it’s glorious, godfather,” cried Ruby, almost dancing. “I’ll be\ncolumbine and you shall be pantaloon.”\n\nThe millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity. “I\nthink, my dear,” he said, “you must get someone else for pantaloon.”\n\n“I will be pantaloon, if you like,” said Colonel Adams, taking his cigar\nout of his mouth, and speaking for the first and last time.\n\n“You ought to have a statue,” cried the Canadian, as he came back,\nradiant, from the telephone. “There, we are all fitted. Mr. Crook shall\nbe clown; he’s a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes. I can\nbe harlequin, that only wants long legs and jumping about. My friend\nFlorian ‘phones he’s bringing the police costume; he’s changing on the\nway. We can act it in this very hall, the audience sitting on those\nbroad stairs opposite, one row above another. These front doors can be\nthe back scene, either open or shut. Shut, you see an English interior.\nOpen, a moonlit garden. It all goes by magic.” And snatching a chance\npiece of billiard chalk from his pocket, he ran it across the hall\nfloor, half-way between the front door and the staircase, to mark the\nline of the footlights.\n\nHow even such a banquet of bosh was got ready in the time remained\na riddle. But they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and\nindustry that lives when youth is in a house; and youth was in that\nhouse that night, though not all may have isolated the two faces and\nhearts from which it flamed. As always happens, the invention grew\nwilder and wilder through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions\nfrom which it had to create. The columbine looked charming in an\noutstanding skirt that strangely resembled the large lamp-shade in the\ndrawing-room. The clown and pantaloon made themselves white with flour\nfrom the cook, and red with rouge from some other domestic, who remained\n(like all true Christian benefactors) anonymous. The harlequin, already\nclad in silver paper out of cigar boxes, was, with difficulty, prevented\nfrom smashing the old Victorian lustre chandeliers, that he might cover\nhimself with resplendent crystals. In fact he would certainly have done\nso, had not Ruby unearthed some old pantomime paste jewels she had worn\nat a fancy dress party as the Queen of Diamonds. Indeed, her uncle,\nJames Blount, was getting almost out of hand in his excitement; he was\nlike a schoolboy. He put a paper donkey’s head unexpectedly on Father\nBrown, who bore it patiently, and even found some private manner of\nmoving his ears. He even essayed to put the paper donkey’s tail to the\ncoat-tails of Sir Leopold Fischer. This, however, was frowned down.\n“Uncle is too absurd,” cried Ruby to Crook, round whose shoulders she\nhad seriously placed a string of sausages. “Why is he so wild?”\n\n“He is harlequin to your columbine,” said Crook. “I am only the clown\nwho makes the old jokes.”\n\n“I wish you were the harlequin,” she said, and left the string of\nsausages swinging.\n\nFather Brown, though he knew every detail done behind the scenes,\nand had even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a\npantomime baby, went round to the front and sat among the audience\nwith all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. The\nspectators were few, relations, one or two local friends, and the\nservants; Sir Leopold sat in the front seat, his full and still\nfur-collared figure largely obscuring the view of the little cleric\nbehind him; but it has never been settled by artistic authorities\nwhether the cleric lost much. The pantomime was utterly chaotic, yet not\ncontemptible; there ran through it a rage of improvisation which came\nchiefly from Crook the clown. Commonly he was a clever man, and he was\ninspired tonight with a wild omniscience, a folly wiser than the world,\nthat which comes to a young man who has seen for an instant a particular\nexpression on a particular face. He was supposed to be the clown, but\nhe was really almost everything else, the author (so far as there was an\nauthor), the prompter, the scene-painter, the scene-shifter, and, above\nall, the orchestra. At abrupt intervals in the outrageous performance\nhe would hurl himself in full costume at the piano and bang out some\npopular music equally absurd and appropriate.\n\nThe climax of this, as of all else, was the moment when the two front\ndoors at the back of the scene flew open, showing the lovely moonlit\ngarden, but showing more prominently the famous professional guest; the\ngreat Florian, dressed up as a policeman. The clown at the piano played\nthe constabulary chorus in the “Pirates of Penzance,” but it was drowned\nin the deafening applause, for every gesture of the great comic actor\nwas an admirable though restrained version of the carriage and manner\nof the police. The harlequin leapt upon him and hit him over the helmet;\nthe pianist playing “Where did you get that hat?” he faced about in\nadmirably simulated astonishment, and then the leaping harlequin hit him\nagain (the pianist suggesting a few bars of “Then we had another one”).\nThen the harlequin rushed right into the arms of the policeman and fell\non top of him, amid a roar of applause. Then it was that the strange\nactor gave that celebrated imitation of a dead man, of which the fame\nstill lingers round Putney. It was almost impossible to believe that a\nliving person could appear so limp.\n\nThe athletic harlequin swung him about like a sack or twisted or tossed\nhim like an Indian club; all the time to the most maddeningly ludicrous\ntunes from the piano. When the harlequin heaved the comic constable\nheavily off the floor the clown played “I arise from dreams of thee.”\n When he shuffled him across his back, “With my bundle on my shoulder,”\n and when the harlequin finally let fall the policeman with a most\nconvincing thud, the lunatic at the instrument struck into a jingling\nmeasure with some words which are still believed to have been, “I sent a\nletter to my love and on the way I dropped it.”\n\nAt about this limit of mental anarchy Father Brown’s view was obscured\naltogether; for the City magnate in front of him rose to his full height\nand thrust his hands savagely into all his pockets. Then he sat down\nnervously, still fumbling, and then stood up again. For an instant it\nseemed seriously likely that he would stride across the footlights; then\nhe turned a glare at the clown playing the piano; and then he burst in\nsilence out of the room.\n\nThe priest had only watched for a few more minutes the absurd but not\ninelegant dance of the amateur harlequin over his splendidly unconscious\nfoe. With real though rude art, the harlequin danced slowly backwards\nout of the door into the garden, which was full of moonlight and\nstillness. The vamped dress of silver paper and paste, which had been\ntoo glaring in the footlights, looked more and more magical and silvery\nas it danced away under a brilliant moon. The audience was closing in\nwith a cataract of applause, when Brown felt his arm abruptly touched,\nand he was asked in a whisper to come into the colonel’s study.\n\nHe followed his summoner with increasing doubt, which was not dispelled\nby a solemn comicality in the scene of the study. There sat Colonel\nAdams, still unaffectedly dressed as a pantaloon, with the knobbed\nwhalebone nodding above his brow, but with his poor old eyes sad enough\nto have sobered a Saturnalia. Sir Leopold Fischer was leaning against\nthe mantelpiece and heaving with all the importance of panic.\n\n“This is a very painful matter, Father Brown,” said Adams. “The truth\nis, those diamonds we all saw this afternoon seem to have vanished from\nmy friend’s tail-coat pocket. And as you--”\n\n“As I,” supplemented Father Brown, with a broad grin, “was sitting just\nbehind him--”\n\n“Nothing of the sort shall be suggested,” said Colonel Adams, with a\nfirm look at Fischer, which rather implied that some such thing had been\nsuggested. “I only ask you to give me the assistance that any gentleman\nmight give.”\n\n“Which is turning out his pockets,” said Father Brown, and proceeded to\ndo so, displaying seven and sixpence, a return ticket, a small silver\ncrucifix, a small breviary, and a stick of chocolate.\n\nThe colonel looked at him long, and then said, “Do you know, I should\nlike to see the inside of your head more than the inside of your\npockets. My daughter is one of your people, I know; well, she has\nlately--” and he stopped.\n\n“She has lately,” cried out old Fischer, “opened her father’s house to\na cut-throat Socialist, who says openly he would steal anything from a\nricher man. This is the end of it. Here is the richer man--and none the\nricher.”\n\n“If you want the inside of my head you can have it,” said Brown rather\nwearily. “What it’s worth you can say afterwards. But the first thing I\nfind in that disused pocket is this: that men who mean to steal diamonds\ndon’t talk Socialism. They are more likely,” he added demurely, “to\ndenounce it.”\n\nBoth the others shifted sharply and the priest went on:\n\n“You see, we know these people, more or less. That Socialist would no\nmore steal a diamond than a Pyramid. We ought to look at once to the one\nman we don’t know. The fellow acting the policeman--Florian. Where is he\nexactly at this minute, I wonder.”\n\nThe pantaloon sprang erect and strode out of the room. An interlude\nensued, during which the millionaire stared at the priest, and the\npriest at his breviary; then the pantaloon returned and said, with\nstaccato gravity, “The policeman is still lying on the stage. The\ncurtain has gone up and down six times; he is still lying there.”\n\nFather Brown dropped his book and stood staring with a look of blank\nmental ruin. Very slowly a light began to creep in his grey eyes, and\nthen he made the scarcely obvious answer.\n\n“Please forgive me, colonel, but when did your wife die?”\n\n“Wife!” replied the staring soldier, “she died this year two months. Her\nbrother James arrived just a week too late to see her.”\n\nThe little priest bounded like a rabbit shot. “Come on!” he cried in\nquite unusual excitement. “Come on! We’ve got to go and look at that\npoliceman!”\n\nThey rushed on to the now curtained stage, breaking rudely past the\ncolumbine and clown (who seemed whispering quite contentedly), and\nFather Brown bent over the prostrate comic policeman.\n\n“Chloroform,” he said as he rose; “I only guessed it just now.”\n\nThere was a startled stillness, and then the colonel said slowly,\n“Please say seriously what all this means.”\n\nFather Brown suddenly shouted with laughter, then stopped, and\nonly struggled with it for instants during the rest of his speech.\n“Gentlemen,” he gasped, “there’s not much time to talk. I must run after\nthe criminal. But this great French actor who played the policeman--this\nclever corpse the harlequin waltzed with and dandled and threw about--he\nwas--” His voice again failed him, and he turned his back to run.\n\n“He was?” called Fischer inquiringly.\n\n“A real policeman,” said Father Brown, and ran away into the dark.\n\nThere were hollows and bowers at the extreme end of that leafy garden,\nin which the laurels and other immortal shrubs showed against sapphire\nsky and silver moon, even in that midwinter, warm colours as of the\nsouth. The green gaiety of the waving laurels, the rich purple indigo\nof the night, the moon like a monstrous crystal, make an almost\nirresponsible romantic picture; and among the top branches of the garden\ntrees a strange figure is climbing, who looks not so much romantic as\nimpossible. He sparkles from head to heel, as if clad in ten million\nmoons; the real moon catches him at every movement and sets a new inch\nof him on fire. But he swings, flashing and successful, from the short\ntree in this garden to the tall, rambling tree in the other, and only\nstops there because a shade has slid under the smaller tree and has\nunmistakably called up to him.\n\n“Well, Flambeau,” says the voice, “you really look like a Flying Star;\nbut that always means a Falling Star at last.”\n\nThe silver, sparkling figure above seems to lean forward in the laurels\nand, confident of escape, listens to the little figure below.\n\n“You never did anything better, Flambeau. It was clever to come from\nCanada (with a Paris ticket, I suppose) just a week after Mrs. Adams\ndied, when no one was in a mood to ask questions. It was cleverer to\nhave marked down the Flying Stars and the very day of Fischer’s coming.\nBut there’s no cleverness, but mere genius, in what followed. Stealing\nthe stones, I suppose, was nothing to you. You could have done it by\nsleight of hand in a hundred other ways besides that pretence of putting\na paper donkey’s tail to Fischer’s coat. But in the rest you eclipsed\nyourself.”\n\nThe silvery figure among the green leaves seems to linger as if\nhypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; he is staring at the\nman below.\n\n“Oh, yes,” says the man below, “I know all about it. I know you not\nonly forced the pantomime, but put it to a double use. You were going\nto steal the stones quietly; news came by an accomplice that you were\nalready suspected, and a capable police officer was coming to rout you\nup that very night. A common thief would have been thankful for the\nwarning and fled; but you are a poet. You already had the clever notion\nof hiding the jewels in a blaze of false stage jewellery. Now, you saw\nthat if the dress were a harlequin’s the appearance of a policeman\nwould be quite in keeping. The worthy officer started from Putney police\nstation to find you, and walked into the queerest trap ever set in this\nworld. When the front door opened he walked straight on to the stage of\na Christmas pantomime, where he could be kicked, clubbed, stunned and\ndrugged by the dancing harlequin, amid roars of laughter from all\nthe most respectable people in Putney. Oh, you will never do anything\nbetter. And now, by the way, you might give me back those diamonds.”\n\nThe green branch on which the glittering figure swung, rustled as if in\nastonishment; but the voice went on:\n\n“I want you to give them back, Flambeau, and I want you to give up this\nlife. There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don’t fancy\nthey will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but\nno man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes\ndown and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills\nand lies about it. Many a man I’ve known started like you to be an\nhonest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\nMaurice Blum started out as an anarchist of principle, a father of the\npoor; he ended a greasy spy and tale-bearer that both sides used and\ndespised. Harry Burke started his free money movement sincerely enough;\nnow he’s sponging on a half-starved sister for endless brandies and\nsodas. Lord Amber went into wild society in a sort of chivalry; now he’s\npaying blackmail to the lowest vultures in London. Captain Barillon\nwas the great gentleman-apache before your time; he died in a madhouse,\nscreaming with fear of the “narks” and receivers that had betrayed\nhim and hunted him down. I know the woods look very free behind you,\nFlambeau; I know that in a flash you could melt into them like a monkey.\nBut some day you will be an old grey monkey, Flambeau. You will sit up\nin your free forest cold at heart and close to death, and the tree-tops\nwill be very bare.”\n\nEverything continued still, as if the small man below held the other in\nthe tree in some long invisible leash; and he went on:\n\n“Your downward steps have begun. You used to boast of doing nothing\nmean, but you are doing something mean tonight. You are leaving\nsuspicion on an honest boy with a good deal against him already; you are\nseparating him from the woman he loves and who loves him. But you will\ndo meaner things than that before you die.”\n\nThree flashing diamonds fell from the tree to the turf. The small man\nstooped to pick them up, and when he looked up again the green cage of\nthe tree was emptied of its silver bird.\n\nThe restoration of the gems (accidentally picked up by Father Brown, of\nall people) ended the evening in uproarious triumph; and Sir Leopold, in\nhis height of good humour, even told the priest that though he himself\nhad broader views, he could respect those whose creed required them to\nbe cloistered and ignorant of this world.\n\n\n\n\nThe Invisible Man\n\n\nIn the cool blue twilight of two steep streets in Camden Town, the shop\nat the corner, a confectioner’s, glowed like the butt of a cigar. One\nshould rather say, perhaps, like the butt of a firework, for the light\nwas of many colours and some complexity, broken up by many mirrors and\ndancing on many gilt and gaily-coloured cakes and sweetmeats. Against\nthis one fiery glass were glued the noses of many gutter-snipes, for\nthe chocolates were all wrapped in those red and gold and green metallic\ncolours which are almost better than chocolate itself; and the huge\nwhite wedding-cake in the window was somehow at once remote and\nsatisfying, just as if the whole North Pole were good to eat.\nSuch rainbow provocations could naturally collect the youth of the\nneighbourhood up to the ages of ten or twelve. But this corner was also\nattractive to youth at a later stage; and a young man, not less than\ntwenty-four, was staring into the same shop window. To him, also,\nthe shop was of fiery charm, but this attraction was not wholly to be\nexplained by chocolates; which, however, he was far from despising.\n\nHe was a tall, burly, red-haired young man, with a resolute face but\na listless manner. He carried under his arm a flat, grey portfolio of\nblack-and-white sketches, which he had sold with more or less success\nto publishers ever since his uncle (who was an admiral) had disinherited\nhim for Socialism, because of a lecture which he had delivered against\nthat economic theory. His name was John Turnbull Angus.\n\nEntering at last, he walked through the confectioner’s shop to the back\nroom, which was a sort of pastry-cook restaurant, merely raising his hat\nto the young lady who was serving there. She was a dark, elegant, alert\ngirl in black, with a high colour and very quick, dark eyes; and after\nthe ordinary interval she followed him into the inner room to take his\norder.\n\nHis order was evidently a usual one. “I want, please,” he said with\nprecision, “one halfpenny bun and a small cup of black coffee.” An\ninstant before the girl could turn away he added, “Also, I want you to\nmarry me.”\n\nThe young lady of the shop stiffened suddenly and said, “Those are jokes\nI don’t allow.”\n\nThe red-haired young man lifted grey eyes of an unexpected gravity.\n\n“Really and truly,” he said, “it’s as serious--as serious as the\nhalfpenny bun. It is expensive, like the bun; one pays for it. It is\nindigestible, like the bun. It hurts.”\n\nThe dark young lady had never taken her dark eyes off him, but seemed\nto be studying him with almost tragic exactitude. At the end of her\nscrutiny she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down\nin a chair.\n\n“Don’t you think,” observed Angus, absently, “that it’s rather cruel to\neat these halfpenny buns? They might grow up into penny buns. I shall\ngive up these brutal sports when we are married.”\n\nThe dark young lady rose from her chair and walked to the window,\nevidently in a state of strong but not unsympathetic cogitation. When at\nlast she swung round again with an air of resolution she was bewildered\nto observe that the young man was carefully laying out on the table\nvarious objects from the shop-window. They included a pyramid of highly\ncoloured sweets, several plates of sandwiches, and the two decanters\ncontaining that mysterious port and sherry which are peculiar to\npastry-cooks. In the middle of this neat arrangement he had carefully\nlet down the enormous load of white sugared cake which had been the huge\nornament of the window.\n\n“What on earth are you doing?” she asked.\n\n“Duty, my dear Laura,” he began.\n\n“Oh, for the Lord’s sake, stop a minute,” she cried, “and don’t talk to\nme in that way. I mean, what is all that?”\n\n“A ceremonial meal, Miss Hope.”\n\n“And what is that?” she asked impatiently, pointing to the mountain of\nsugar.\n\n“The wedding-cake, Mrs. Angus,” he said.\n\nThe girl marched to that article, removed it with some clatter, and put\nit back in the shop window; she then returned, and, putting her elegant\nelbows on the table, regarded the young man not unfavourably but with\nconsiderable exasperation.\n\n“You don’t give me any time to think,” she said.\n\n“I’m not such a fool,” he answered; “that’s my Christian humility.”\n\nShe was still looking at him; but she had grown considerably graver\nbehind the smile.\n\n“Mr. Angus,” she said steadily, “before there is a minute more of this\nnonsense I must tell you something about myself as shortly as I can.’”\n\n“Delighted,” replied Angus gravely. “You might tell me something about\nmyself, too, while you are about it.”\n\n“Oh, do hold your tongue and listen,” she said. “It’s nothing that I’m\nashamed of, and it isn’t even anything that I’m specially sorry about.\nBut what would you say if there were something that is no business of\nmine and yet is my nightmare?”\n\n“In that case,” said the man seriously, “I should suggest that you bring\nback the cake.”\n\n“Well, you must listen to the story first,” said Laura, persistently.\n“To begin with, I must tell you that my father owned the inn called the\n‘Red Fish’ at Ludbury, and I used to serve people in the bar.”\n\n“I have often wondered,” he said, “why there was a kind of a Christian\nair about this one confectioner’s shop.”\n\n“Ludbury is a sleepy, grassy little hole in the Eastern Counties, and\nthe only kind of people who ever came to the ‘Red Fish’ were occasional\ncommercial travellers, and for the rest, the most awful people you can\nsee, only you’ve never seen them. I mean little, loungy men, who had\njust enough to live on and had nothing to do but lean about in bar-rooms\nand bet on horses, in bad clothes that were just too good for them.\nEven these wretched young rotters were not very common at our house; but\nthere were two of them that were a lot too common--common in every sort\nof way. They both lived on money of their own, and were wearisomely idle\nand over-dressed. But yet I was a bit sorry for them, because I half\nbelieve they slunk into our little empty bar because each of them had a\nslight deformity; the sort of thing that some yokels laugh at. It wasn’t\nexactly a deformity either; it was more an oddity. One of them was\na surprisingly small man, something like a dwarf, or at least like a\njockey. He was not at all jockeyish to look at, though; he had a round\nblack head and a well-trimmed black beard, bright eyes like a bird’s; he\njingled money in his pockets; he jangled a great gold watch chain; and\nhe never turned up except dressed just too much like a gentleman to\nbe one. He was no fool though, though a futile idler; he was curiously\nclever at all kinds of things that couldn’t be the slightest use; a sort\nof impromptu conjuring; making fifteen matches set fire to each other\nlike a regular firework; or cutting a banana or some such thing into a\ndancing doll. His name was Isidore Smythe; and I can see him still, with\nhis little dark face, just coming up to the counter, making a jumping\nkangaroo out of five cigars.\n\n“The other fellow was more silent and more ordinary; but somehow he\nalarmed me much more than poor little Smythe. He was very tall and\nslight, and light-haired; his nose had a high bridge, and he might\nalmost have been handsome in a spectral sort of way; but he had one of\nthe most appalling squints I have ever seen or heard of. When he looked\nstraight at you, you didn’t know where you were yourself, let alone what\nhe was looking at. I fancy this sort of disfigurement embittered the\npoor chap a little; for while Smythe was ready to show off his monkey\ntricks anywhere, James Welkin (that was the squinting man’s name) never\ndid anything except soak in our bar parlour, and go for great walks\nby himself in the flat, grey country all round. All the same, I think\nSmythe, too, was a little sensitive about being so small, though he\ncarried it off more smartly. And so it was that I was really puzzled, as\nwell as startled, and very sorry, when they both offered to marry me in\nthe same week.\n\n“Well, I did what I’ve since thought was perhaps a silly thing. But,\nafter all, these freaks were my friends in a way; and I had a horror of\ntheir thinking I refused them for the real reason, which was that they\nwere so impossibly ugly. So I made up some gas of another sort, about\nnever meaning to marry anyone who hadn’t carved his way in the world. I\nsaid it was a point of principle with me not to live on money that\nwas just inherited like theirs. Two days after I had talked in this\nwell-meaning sort of way, the whole trouble began. The first thing I\nheard was that both of them had gone off to seek their fortunes, as if\nthey were in some silly fairy tale.\n\n“Well, I’ve never seen either of them from that day to this. But I’ve\nhad two letters from the little man called Smythe, and really they were\nrather exciting.”\n\n“Ever heard of the other man?” asked Angus.\n\n“No, he never wrote,” said the girl, after an instant’s hesitation.\n“Smythe’s first letter was simply to say that he had started out walking\nwith Welkin to London; but Welkin was such a good walker that the little\nman dropped out of it, and took a rest by the roadside. He happened to\nbe picked up by some travelling show, and, partly because he was nearly\na dwarf, and partly because he was really a clever little wretch, he\ngot on quite well in the show business, and was soon sent up to the\nAquarium, to do some tricks that I forget. That was his first letter.\nHis second was much more of a startler, and I only got it last week.”\n\nThe man called Angus emptied his coffee-cup and regarded her with mild\nand patient eyes. Her own mouth took a slight twist of laughter as\nshe resumed, “I suppose you’ve seen on the hoardings all about this\n‘Smythe’s Silent Service’? Or you must be the only person that hasn’t.\nOh, I don’t know much about it, it’s some clockwork invention for doing\nall the housework by machinery. You know the sort of thing: ‘Press a\nButton--A Butler who Never Drinks.’ ‘Turn a Handle--Ten Housemaids who\nNever Flirt.’ You must have seen the advertisements. Well, whatever\nthese machines are, they are making pots of money; and they are making\nit all for that little imp whom I knew down in Ludbury. I can’t help\nfeeling pleased the poor little chap has fallen on his feet; but the\nplain fact is, I’m in terror of his turning up any minute and telling me\nhe’s carved his way in the world--as he certainly has.”\n\n“And the other man?” repeated Angus with a sort of obstinate quietude.\n\nLaura Hope got to her feet suddenly. “My friend,” she said, “I think\nyou are a witch. Yes, you are quite right. I have not seen a line of the\nother man’s writing; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or\nwhere he is. But it is of him that I am frightened. It is he who is all\nabout my path. It is he who has half driven me mad. Indeed, I think he\nhas driven me mad; for I have felt him where he could not have been, and\nI have heard his voice when he could not have spoken.”\n\n“Well, my dear,” said the young man, cheerfully, “if he were Satan\nhimself, he is done for now you have told somebody. One goes mad all\nalone, old girl. But when was it you fancied you felt and heard our\nsquinting friend?”\n\n“I heard James Welkin laugh as plainly as I hear you speak,” said the\ngirl, steadily. “There was nobody there, for I stood just outside the\nshop at the corner, and could see down both streets at once. I had\nforgotten how he laughed, though his laugh was as odd as his squint. I\nhad not thought of him for nearly a year. But it’s a solemn truth that a\nfew seconds later the first letter came from his rival.”\n\n“Did you ever make the spectre speak or squeak, or anything?” asked\nAngus, with some interest.\n\nLaura suddenly shuddered, and then said, with an unshaken voice, “Yes.\nJust when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe\nannouncing his success. Just then, I heard Welkin say, ‘He shan’t have\nyou, though.’ It was quite plain, as if he were in the room. It is\nawful, I think I must be mad.”\n\n“If you really were mad,” said the young man, “you would think you must\nbe sane. But certainly there seems to me to be something a little rum\nabout this unseen gentleman. Two heads are better than one--I spare you\nallusions to any other organs and really, if you would allow me, as\na sturdy, practical man, to bring back the wedding-cake out of the\nwindow--”\n\nEven as he spoke, there was a sort of steely shriek in the street\noutside, and a small motor, driven at devilish speed, shot up to the\ndoor of the shop and stuck there. In the same flash of time a small man\nin a shiny top hat stood stamping in the outer room.\n\nAngus, who had hitherto maintained hilarious ease from motives of mental\nhygiene, revealed the strain of his soul by striding abruptly out of\nthe inner room and confronting the new-comer. A glance at him was quite\nsufficient to confirm the savage guesswork of a man in love. This\nvery dapper but dwarfish figure, with the spike of black beard carried\ninsolently forward, the clever unrestful eyes, the neat but very nervous\nfingers, could be none other than the man just described to him: Isidore\nSmythe, who made dolls out of banana skins and match-boxes; Isidore\nSmythe, who made millions out of undrinking butlers and unflirting\nhousemaids of metal. For a moment the two men, instinctively\nunderstanding each other’s air of possession, looked at each other with\nthat curious cold generosity which is the soul of rivalry.\n\nMr. Smythe, however, made no allusion to the ultimate ground of their\nantagonism, but said simply and explosively, “Has Miss Hope seen that\nthing on the window?”\n\n“On the window?” repeated the staring Angus.\n\n“There’s no time to explain other things,” said the small millionaire\nshortly. “There’s some tomfoolery going on here that has to be\ninvestigated.”\n\nHe pointed his polished walking-stick at the window, recently depleted\nby the bridal preparations of Mr. Angus; and that gentleman was\nastonished to see along the front of the glass a long strip of paper\npasted, which had certainly not been on the window when he looked\nthrough it some time before. Following the energetic Smythe outside into\nthe street, he found that some yard and a half of stamp paper had been\ncarefully gummed along the glass outside, and on this was written in\nstraggly characters, “If you marry Smythe, he will die.”\n\n“Laura,” said Angus, putting his big red head into the shop, “you’re not\nmad.”\n\n“It’s the writing of that fellow Welkin,” said Smythe gruffly. “I\nhaven’t seen him for years, but he’s always bothering me. Five times in\nthe last fortnight he’s had threatening letters left at my flat, and I\ncan’t even find out who leaves them, let alone if it is Welkin himself.\nThe porter of the flats swears that no suspicious characters have been\nseen, and here he has pasted up a sort of dado on a public shop window,\nwhile the people in the shop--”\n\n“Quite so,” said Angus modestly, “while the people in the shop were\nhaving tea. Well, sir, I can assure you I appreciate your common sense\nin dealing so directly with the matter. We can talk about other things\nafterwards. The fellow cannot be very far off yet, for I swear there was\nno paper there when I went last to the window, ten or fifteen minutes\nago. On the other hand, he’s too far off to be chased, as we don’t even\nknow the direction. If you’ll take my advice, Mr. Smythe, you’ll put\nthis at once in the hands of some energetic inquiry man, private rather\nthan public. I know an extremely clever fellow, who has set up in\nbusiness five minutes from here in your car. His name’s Flambeau, and\nthough his youth was a bit stormy, he’s a strictly honest man now, and\nhis brains are worth money. He lives in Lucknow Mansions, Hampstead.”\n\n“That is odd,” said the little man, arching his black eyebrows. “I live,\nmyself, in Himylaya Mansions, round the corner. Perhaps you might care\nto come with me; I can go to my rooms and sort out these queer Welkin\ndocuments, while you run round and get your friend the detective.”\n\n“You are very good,” said Angus politely. “Well, the sooner we act the\nbetter.”\n\nBoth men, with a queer kind of impromptu fairness, took the same sort of\nformal farewell of the lady, and both jumped into the brisk little\ncar. As Smythe took the handles and they turned the great corner of the\nstreet, Angus was amused to see a gigantesque poster of “Smythe’s\nSilent Service,” with a picture of a huge headless iron doll, carrying a\nsaucepan with the legend, “A Cook Who is Never Cross.”\n\n“I use them in my own flat,” said the little black-bearded man,\nlaughing, “partly for advertisements, and partly for real convenience.\nHonestly, and all above board, those big clockwork dolls of mine do\nbring your coals or claret or a timetable quicker than any live servants\nI’ve ever known, if you know which knob to press. But I’ll never deny,\nbetween ourselves, that such servants have their disadvantages, too.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Angus; “is there something they can’t do?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Smythe coolly; “they can’t tell me who left those\nthreatening letters at my flat.”\n\nThe man’s motor was small and swift like himself; in fact, like his\ndomestic service, it was of his own invention. If he was an advertising\nquack, he was one who believed in his own wares. The sense of something\ntiny and flying was accentuated as they swept up long white curves of\nroad in the dead but open daylight of evening. Soon the white curves\ncame sharper and dizzier; they were upon ascending spirals, as they say\nin the modern religions. For, indeed, they were cresting a corner of\nLondon which is almost as precipitous as Edinburgh, if not quite so\npicturesque. Terrace rose above terrace, and the special tower of flats\nthey sought, rose above them all to almost Egyptian height, gilt by\nthe level sunset. The change, as they turned the corner and entered the\ncrescent known as Himylaya Mansions, was as abrupt as the opening of a\nwindow; for they found that pile of flats sitting above London as above\na green sea of slate. Opposite to the mansions, on the other side of the\ngravel crescent, was a bushy enclosure more like a steep hedge or dyke\nthan a garden, and some way below that ran a strip of artificial water,\na sort of canal, like the moat of that embowered fortress. As the car\nswept round the crescent it passed, at one corner, the stray stall of\na man selling chestnuts; and right away at the other end of the curve,\nAngus could see a dim blue policeman walking slowly. These were the only\nhuman shapes in that high suburban solitude; but he had an irrational\nsense that they expressed the speechless poetry of London. He felt as if\nthey were figures in a story.\n\nThe little car shot up to the right house like a bullet, and shot out\nits owner like a bomb shell. He was immediately inquiring of a tall\ncommissionaire in shining braid, and a short porter in shirt sleeves,\nwhether anybody or anything had been seeking his apartments. He was\nassured that nobody and nothing had passed these officials since his\nlast inquiries; whereupon he and the slightly bewildered Angus were shot\nup in the lift like a rocket, till they reached the top floor.\n\n“Just come in for a minute,” said the breathless Smythe. “I want to show\nyou those Welkin letters. Then you might run round the corner and fetch\nyour friend.” He pressed a button concealed in the wall, and the door\nopened of itself.\n\nIt opened on a long, commodious ante-room, of which the only arresting\nfeatures, ordinarily speaking, were the rows of tall half-human\nmechanical figures that stood up on both sides like tailors’ dummies.\nLike tailors’ dummies they were headless; and like tailors’ dummies\nthey had a handsome unnecessary humpiness in the shoulders, and a\npigeon-breasted protuberance of chest; but barring this, they were not\nmuch more like a human figure than any automatic machine at a station\nthat is about the human height. They had two great hooks like arms, for\ncarrying trays; and they were painted pea-green, or vermilion, or\nblack for convenience of distinction; in every other way they were only\nautomatic machines and nobody would have looked twice at them. On\nthis occasion, at least, nobody did. For between the two rows of\nthese domestic dummies lay something more interesting than most of the\nmechanics of the world. It was a white, tattered scrap of paper scrawled\nwith red ink; and the agile inventor had snatched it up almost as soon\nas the door flew open. He handed it to Angus without a word. The red ink\non it actually was not dry, and the message ran, “If you have been to\nsee her today, I shall kill you.”\n\nThere was a short silence, and then Isidore Smythe said quietly, “Would\nyou like a little whiskey? I rather feel as if I should.”\n\n“Thank you; I should like a little Flambeau,” said Angus, gloomily.\n“This business seems to me to be getting rather grave. I’m going round\nat once to fetch him.”\n\n“Right you are,” said the other, with admirable cheerfulness. “Bring him\nround here as quick as you can.”\n\nBut as Angus closed the front door behind him he saw Smythe push back a\nbutton, and one of the clockwork images glided from its place and slid\nalong a groove in the floor carrying a tray with syphon and decanter.\nThere did seem something a trifle weird about leaving the little man\nalone among those dead servants, who were coming to life as the door\nclosed.\n\nSix steps down from Smythe’s landing the man in shirt sleeves was doing\nsomething with a pail. Angus stopped to extract a promise, fortified\nwith a prospective bribe, that he would remain in that place until the\nreturn with the detective, and would keep count of any kind of stranger\ncoming up those stairs. Dashing down to the front hall he then laid\nsimilar charges of vigilance on the commissionaire at the front door,\nfrom whom he learned the simplifying circumstances that there was no\nback door. Not content with this, he captured the floating policeman\nand induced him to stand opposite the entrance and watch it; and finally\npaused an instant for a pennyworth of chestnuts, and an inquiry as to\nthe probable length of the merchant’s stay in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe chestnut seller, turning up the collar of his coat, told him he\nshould probably be moving shortly, as he thought it was going to snow.\nIndeed, the evening was growing grey and bitter, but Angus, with all his\neloquence, proceeded to nail the chestnut man to his post.\n\n“Keep yourself warm on your own chestnuts,” he said earnestly. “Eat\nup your whole stock; I’ll make it worth your while. I’ll give you a\nsovereign if you’ll wait here till I come back, and then tell me\nwhether any man, woman, or child has gone into that house where the\ncommissionaire is standing.”\n\nHe then walked away smartly, with a last look at the besieged tower.\n\n“I’ve made a ring round that room, anyhow,” he said. “They can’t all\nfour of them be Mr. Welkin’s accomplices.”\n\nLucknow Mansions were, so to speak, on a lower platform of that hill\nof houses, of which Himylaya Mansions might be called the peak. Mr.\nFlambeau’s semi-official flat was on the ground floor, and presented\nin every way a marked contrast to the American machinery and cold\nhotel-like luxury of the flat of the Silent Service. Flambeau, who was\na friend of Angus, received him in a rococo artistic den behind his\noffice, of which the ornaments were sabres, harquebuses, Eastern\ncuriosities, flasks of Italian wine, savage cooking-pots, a plumy\nPersian cat, and a small dusty-looking Roman Catholic priest, who looked\nparticularly out of place.\n\n“This is my friend Father Brown,” said Flambeau. “I’ve often wanted you\nto meet him. Splendid weather, this; a little cold for Southerners like\nme.”\n\n“Yes, I think it will keep clear,” said Angus, sitting down on a\nviolet-striped Eastern ottoman.\n\n“No,” said the priest quietly, “it has begun to snow.”\n\nAnd, indeed, as he spoke, the first few flakes, foreseen by the man of\nchestnuts, began to drift across the darkening windowpane.\n\n“Well,” said Angus heavily. “I’m afraid I’ve come on business, and\nrather jumpy business at that. The fact is, Flambeau, within a stone’s\nthrow of your house is a fellow who badly wants your help; he’s\nperpetually being haunted and threatened by an invisible enemy--a\nscoundrel whom nobody has even seen.” As Angus proceeded to tell the\nwhole tale of Smythe and Welkin, beginning with Laura’s story, and\ngoing on with his own, the supernatural laugh at the corner of two empty\nstreets, the strange distinct words spoken in an empty room, Flambeau\ngrew more and more vividly concerned, and the little priest seemed to be\nleft out of it, like a piece of furniture. When it came to the scribbled\nstamp-paper pasted on the window, Flambeau rose, seeming to fill the\nroom with his huge shoulders.\n\n“If you don’t mind,” he said, “I think you had better tell me the rest\non the nearest road to this man’s house. It strikes me, somehow, that\nthere is no time to be lost.”\n\n“Delighted,” said Angus, rising also, “though he’s safe enough for the\npresent, for I’ve set four men to watch the only hole to his burrow.”\n\nThey turned out into the street, the small priest trundling after them\nwith the docility of a small dog. He merely said, in a cheerful way,\nlike one making conversation, “How quick the snow gets thick on the\nground.”\n\nAs they threaded the steep side streets already powdered with silver,\nAngus finished his story; and by the time they reached the crescent with\nthe towering flats, he had leisure to turn his attention to the four\nsentinels. The chestnut seller, both before and after receiving a\nsovereign, swore stubbornly that he had watched the door and seen no\nvisitor enter. The policeman was even more emphatic. He said he had had\nexperience of crooks of all kinds, in top hats and in rags; he wasn’t so\ngreen as to expect suspicious characters to look suspicious; he looked\nout for anybody, and, so help him, there had been nobody. And when all\nthree men gathered round the gilded commissionaire, who still stood\nsmiling astride of the porch, the verdict was more final still.\n\n“I’ve got a right to ask any man, duke or dustman, what he wants in\nthese flats,” said the genial and gold-laced giant, “and I’ll swear\nthere’s been nobody to ask since this gentleman went away.”\n\nThe unimportant Father Brown, who stood back, looking modestly at the\npavement, here ventured to say meekly, “Has nobody been up and down\nstairs, then, since the snow began to fall? It began while we were all\nround at Flambeau’s.”\n\n“Nobody’s been in here, sir, you can take it from me,” said the\nofficial, with beaming authority.\n\n“Then I wonder what that is?” said the priest, and stared at the ground\nblankly like a fish.\n\nThe others all looked down also; and Flambeau used a fierce exclamation\nand a French gesture. For it was unquestionably true that down the\nmiddle of the entrance guarded by the man in gold lace, actually between\nthe arrogant, stretched legs of that colossus, ran a stringy pattern of\ngrey footprints stamped upon the white snow.\n\n“God!” cried Angus involuntarily, “the Invisible Man!”\n\nWithout another word he turned and dashed up the stairs, with Flambeau\nfollowing; but Father Brown still stood looking about him in the\nsnow-clad street as if he had lost interest in his query.\n\nFlambeau was plainly in a mood to break down the door with his big\nshoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition,\nfumbled about on the frame of the door till he found the invisible\nbutton; and the door swung slowly open.\n\nIt showed substantially the same serried interior; the hall had grown\ndarker, though it was still struck here and there with the last crimson\nshafts of sunset, and one or two of the headless machines had been moved\nfrom their places for this or that purpose, and stood here and there\nabout the twilit place. The green and red of their coats were all\ndarkened in the dusk; and their likeness to human shapes slightly\nincreased by their very shapelessness. But in the middle of them all,\nexactly where the paper with the red ink had lain, there lay something\nthat looked like red ink spilt out of its bottle. But it was not red\nink.\n\nWith a French combination of reason and violence Flambeau simply said\n“Murder!” and, plunging into the flat, had explored, every corner and\ncupboard of it in five minutes. But if he expected to find a corpse he\nfound none. Isidore Smythe was not in the place, either dead or alive.\nAfter the most tearing search the two men met each other in the outer\nhall, with streaming faces and staring eyes. “My friend,” said Flambeau,\ntalking French in his excitement, “not only is your murderer invisible,\nbut he makes invisible also the murdered man.”\n\nAngus looked round at the dim room full of dummies, and in some Celtic\ncorner of his Scotch soul a shudder started. One of the life-size dolls\nstood immediately overshadowing the blood stain, summoned, perhaps,\nby the slain man an instant before he fell. One of the high-shouldered\nhooks that served the thing for arms, was a little lifted, and Angus had\nsuddenly the horrid fancy that poor Smythe’s own iron child had struck\nhim down. Matter had rebelled, and these machines had killed their\nmaster. But even so, what had they done with him?\n\n“Eaten him?” said the nightmare at his ear; and he sickened for an\ninstant at the idea of rent, human remains absorbed and crushed into all\nthat acephalous clockwork.\n\nHe recovered his mental health by an emphatic effort, and said to\nFlambeau, “Well, there it is. The poor fellow has evaporated like a\ncloud and left a red streak on the floor. The tale does not belong to\nthis world.”\n\n“There is only one thing to be done,” said Flambeau, “whether it belongs\nto this world or the other. I must go down and talk to my friend.”\n\nThey descended, passing the man with the pail, who again asseverated\nthat he had let no intruder pass, down to the commissionaire and the\nhovering chestnut man, who rigidly reasserted their own watchfulness.\nBut when Angus looked round for his fourth confirmation he could not see\nit, and called out with some nervousness, “Where is the policeman?”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Father Brown; “that is my fault. I just sent\nhim down the road to investigate something--that I just thought worth\ninvestigating.”\n\n“Well, we want him back pretty soon,” said Angus abruptly, “for the\nwretched man upstairs has not only been murdered, but wiped out.”\n\n“How?” asked the priest.\n\n“Father,” said Flambeau, after a pause, “upon my soul I believe it is\nmore in your department than mine. No friend or foe has entered the\nhouse, but Smythe is gone, as if stolen by the fairies. If that is not\nsupernatural, I--”\n\nAs he spoke they were all checked by an unusual sight; the big blue\npoliceman came round the corner of the crescent, running. He came\nstraight up to Brown.\n\n“You’re right, sir,” he panted, “they’ve just found poor Mr. Smythe’s\nbody in the canal down below.”\n\nAngus put his hand wildly to his head. “Did he run down and drown\nhimself?” he asked.\n\n“He never came down, I’ll swear,” said the constable, “and he wasn’t\ndrowned either, for he died of a great stab over the heart.”\n\n“And yet you saw no one enter?” said Flambeau in a grave voice.\n\n“Let us walk down the road a little,” said the priest.\n\nAs they reached the other end of the crescent he observed abruptly,\n“Stupid of me! I forgot to ask the policeman something. I wonder if they\nfound a light brown sack.”\n\n“Why a light brown sack?” asked Angus, astonished.\n\n“Because if it was any other coloured sack, the case must begin over\nagain,” said Father Brown; “but if it was a light brown sack, why, the\ncase is finished.”\n\n“I am pleased to hear it,” said Angus with hearty irony. “It hasn’t\nbegun, so far as I am concerned.”\n\n“You must tell us all about it,” said Flambeau with a strange heavy\nsimplicity, like a child.\n\nUnconsciously they were walking with quickening steps down the long\nsweep of road on the other side of the high crescent, Father Brown\nleading briskly, though in silence. At last he said with an almost\ntouching vagueness, “Well, I’m afraid you’ll think it so prosy. We\nalways begin at the abstract end of things, and you can’t begin this\nstory anywhere else.\n\n“Have you ever noticed this--that people never answer what you say? They\nanswer what you mean--or what they think you mean. Suppose one lady says\nto another in a country house, ‘Is anybody staying with you?’ the lady\ndoesn’t answer ‘Yes; the butler, the three footmen, the parlourmaid, and\nso on,’ though the parlourmaid may be in the room, or the butler behind\nher chair. She says ‘There is nobody staying with us,’ meaning nobody of\nthe sort you mean. But suppose a doctor inquiring into an epidemic asks,\n‘Who is staying in the house?’ then the lady will remember the butler,\nthe parlourmaid, and the rest. All language is used like that; you never\nget a question answered literally, even when you get it answered truly.\nWhen those four quite honest men said that no man had gone into the\nMansions, they did not really mean that no man had gone into them. They\nmeant no man whom they could suspect of being your man. A man did go\ninto the house, and did come out of it, but they never noticed him.”\n\n“An invisible man?” inquired Angus, raising his red eyebrows. “A\nmentally invisible man,” said Father Brown.\n\nA minute or two after he resumed in the same unassuming voice, like a\nman thinking his way. “Of course you can’t think of such a man, until\nyou do think of him. That’s where his cleverness comes in. But I came\nto think of him through two or three little things in the tale Mr. Angus\ntold us. First, there was the fact that this Welkin went for long walks.\nAnd then there was the vast lot of stamp paper on the window. And then,\nmost of all, there were the two things the young lady said--things that\ncouldn’t be true. Don’t get annoyed,” he added hastily, noting a sudden\nmovement of the Scotchman’s head; “she thought they were true. A person\ncan’t be quite alone in a street a second before she receives a letter.\nShe can’t be quite alone in a street when she starts reading a letter\njust received. There must be somebody pretty near her; he must be\nmentally invisible.”\n\n“Why must there be somebody near her?” asked Angus.\n\n“Because,” said Father Brown, “barring carrier-pigeons, somebody must\nhave brought her the letter.”\n\n“Do you really mean to say,” asked Flambeau, with energy, “that Welkin\ncarried his rival’s letters to his lady?”\n\n“Yes,” said the priest. “Welkin carried his rival’s letters to his lady.\nYou see, he had to.”\n\n“Oh, I can’t stand much more of this,” exploded Flambeau. “Who is this\nfellow? What does he look like? What is the usual get-up of a mentally\ninvisible man?”\n\n“He is dressed rather handsomely in red, blue and gold,” replied the\npriest promptly with precision, “and in this striking, and even showy,\ncostume he entered Himylaya Mansions under eight human eyes; he killed\nSmythe in cold blood, and came down into the street again carrying the\ndead body in his arms--”\n\n“Reverend sir,” cried Angus, standing still, “are you raving mad, or am\nI?”\n\n“You are not mad,” said Brown, “only a little unobservant. You have not\nnoticed such a man as this, for example.”\n\nHe took three quick strides forward, and put his hand on the shoulder of\nan ordinary passing postman who had bustled by them unnoticed under the\nshade of the trees.\n\n“Nobody ever notices postmen somehow,” he said thoughtfully; “yet they\nhave passions like other men, and even carry large bags where a small\ncorpse can be stowed quite easily.”\n\nThe postman, instead of turning naturally, had ducked and tumbled\nagainst the garden fence. He was a lean fair-bearded man of very\nordinary appearance, but as he turned an alarmed face over his shoulder,\nall three men were fixed with an almost fiendish squint.\n\n              * * * * *\n\nFlambeau went back to his sabres, purple rugs and Persian cat, having\nmany things to attend to. John Turnbull Angus went back to the lady at\nthe shop, with whom that imprudent young man contrives to be extremely\ncomfortable. But Father Brown walked those snow-covered hills under the\nstars for many hours with a murderer, and what they said to each other\nwill never be known.\n\n\n\n\nThe Honour of Israel Gow\n\n\nA stormy evening of olive and silver was closing in, as Father Brown,\nwrapped in a grey Scotch plaid, came to the end of a grey Scotch valley\nand beheld the strange castle of Glengyle. It stopped one end of the\nglen or hollow like a blind alley; and it looked like the end of the\nworld. Rising in steep roofs and spires of seagreen slate in the manner\nof the old French-Scotch chateaux, it reminded an Englishman of the\nsinister steeple-hats of witches in fairy tales; and the pine woods\nthat rocked round the green turrets looked, by comparison, as black\nas numberless flocks of ravens. This note of a dreamy, almost a sleepy\ndevilry, was no mere fancy from the landscape. For there did rest on\nthe place one of those clouds of pride and madness and mysterious sorrow\nwhich lie more heavily on the noble houses of Scotland than on any other\nof the children of men. For Scotland has a double dose of the poison\ncalled heredity; the sense of blood in the aristocrat, and the sense of\ndoom in the Calvinist.\n\nThe priest had snatched a day from his business at Glasgow to meet his\nfriend Flambeau, the amateur detective, who was at Glengyle Castle with\nanother more formal officer investigating the life and death of the late\nEarl of Glengyle. That mysterious person was the last representative\nof a race whose valour, insanity, and violent cunning had made them\nterrible even among the sinister nobility of their nation in the\nsixteenth century. None were deeper in that labyrinthine ambition, in\nchamber within chamber of that palace of lies that was built up around\nMary Queen of Scots.\n\nThe rhyme in the country-side attested the motive and the result of\ntheir machinations candidly:\n\n     As green sap to the simmer trees\n     Is red gold to the Ogilvies.\n\nFor many centuries there had never been a decent lord in Glengyle\nCastle; and with the Victorian era one would have thought that all\neccentricities were exhausted. The last Glengyle, however, satisfied his\ntribal tradition by doing the only thing that was left for him to do; he\ndisappeared. I do not mean that he went abroad; by all accounts he was\nstill in the castle, if he was anywhere. But though his name was in the\nchurch register and the big red Peerage, nobody ever saw him under the\nsun.\n\nIf anyone saw him it was a solitary man-servant, something between a\ngroom and a gardener. He was so deaf that the more business-like\nassumed him to be dumb; while the more penetrating declared him to be\nhalf-witted. A gaunt, red-haired labourer, with a dogged jaw and chin,\nbut quite blank blue eyes, he went by the name of Israel Gow, and was\nthe one silent servant on that deserted estate. But the energy with\nwhich he dug potatoes, and the regularity with which he disappeared\ninto the kitchen gave people an impression that he was providing for the\nmeals of a superior, and that the strange earl was still concealed in\nthe castle. If society needed any further proof that he was there, the\nservant persistently asserted that he was not at home. One morning the\nprovost and the minister (for the Glengyles were Presbyterian) were\nsummoned to the castle. There they found that the gardener, groom and\ncook had added to his many professions that of an undertaker, and had\nnailed up his noble master in a coffin. With how much or how little\nfurther inquiry this odd fact was passed, did not as yet very plainly\nappear; for the thing had never been legally investigated till Flambeau\nhad gone north two or three days before. By then the body of Lord\nGlengyle (if it was the body) had lain for some time in the little\nchurchyard on the hill.\n\nAs Father Brown passed through the dim garden and came under the\nshadow of the chateau, the clouds were thick and the whole air damp\nand thundery. Against the last stripe of the green-gold sunset he saw\na black human silhouette; a man in a chimney-pot hat, with a big spade\nover his shoulder. The combination was queerly suggestive of a sexton;\nbut when Brown remembered the deaf servant who dug potatoes, he thought\nit natural enough. He knew something of the Scotch peasant; he knew the\nrespectability which might well feel it necessary to wear “blacks” for\nan official inquiry; he knew also the economy that would not lose an\nhour’s digging for that. Even the man’s start and suspicious stare as\nthe priest went by were consonant enough with the vigilance and jealousy\nof such a type.\n\nThe great door was opened by Flambeau himself, who had with him a lean\nman with iron-grey hair and papers in his hand: Inspector Craven from\nScotland Yard. The entrance hall was mostly stripped and empty; but the\npale, sneering faces of one or two of the wicked Ogilvies looked down\nout of black periwigs and blackening canvas.\n\nFollowing them into an inner room, Father Brown found that the allies\nhad been seated at a long oak table, of which their end was covered with\nscribbled papers, flanked with whisky and cigars. Through the whole of\nits remaining length it was occupied by detached objects arranged at\nintervals; objects about as inexplicable as any objects could be. One\nlooked like a small heap of glittering broken glass. Another looked like\na high heap of brown dust. A third appeared to be a plain stick of wood.\n\n“You seem to have a sort of geological museum here,” he said, as he sat\ndown, jerking his head briefly in the direction of the brown dust and\nthe crystalline fragments.\n\n“Not a geological museum,” replied Flambeau; “say a psychological\nmuseum.”\n\n“Oh, for the Lord’s sake,” cried the police detective laughing, “don’t\nlet’s begin with such long words.”\n\n“Don’t you know what psychology means?” asked Flambeau with friendly\nsurprise. “Psychology means being off your chump.”\n\n“Still I hardly follow,” replied the official.\n\n“Well,” said Flambeau, with decision, “I mean that we’ve only found out\none thing about Lord Glengyle. He was a maniac.”\n\nThe black silhouette of Gow with his top hat and spade passed the\nwindow, dimly outlined against the darkening sky. Father Brown stared\npassively at it and answered:\n\n“I can understand there must have been something odd about the man, or\nhe wouldn’t have buried himself alive--nor been in such a hurry to bury\nhimself dead. But what makes you think it was lunacy?”\n\n“Well,” said Flambeau, “you just listen to the list of things Mr. Craven\nhas found in the house.”\n\n“We must get a candle,” said Craven, suddenly. “A storm is getting up,\nand it’s too dark to read.”\n\n“Have you found any candles,” asked Brown smiling, “among your\noddities?”\n\nFlambeau raised a grave face, and fixed his dark eyes on his friend.\n\n“That is curious, too,” he said. “Twenty-five candles, and not a trace\nof a candlestick.”\n\nIn the rapidly darkening room and rapidly rising wind, Brown went along\nthe table to where a bundle of wax candles lay among the other scrappy\nexhibits. As he did so he bent accidentally over the heap of red-brown\ndust; and a sharp sneeze cracked the silence.\n\n“Hullo!” he said, “snuff!”\n\nHe took one of the candles, lit it carefully, came back and stuck it in\nthe neck of the whisky bottle. The unrestful night air, blowing through\nthe crazy window, waved the long flame like a banner. And on every side\nof the castle they could hear the miles and miles of black pine wood\nseething like a black sea around a rock.\n\n“I will read the inventory,” began Craven gravely, picking up one of\nthe papers, “the inventory of what we found loose and unexplained in the\ncastle. You are to understand that the place generally was dismantled\nand neglected; but one or two rooms had plainly been inhabited in a\nsimple but not squalid style by somebody; somebody who was not the\nservant Gow. The list is as follows:\n\n“First item. A very considerable hoard of precious stones, nearly\nall diamonds, and all of them loose, without any setting whatever. Of\ncourse, it is natural that the Ogilvies should have family jewels; but\nthose are exactly the jewels that are almost always set in particular\narticles of ornament. The Ogilvies would seem to have kept theirs loose\nin their pockets, like coppers.\n\n“Second item. Heaps and heaps of loose snuff, not kept in a horn, or\neven a pouch, but lying in heaps on the mantelpieces, on the sideboard,\non the piano, anywhere. It looks as if the old gentleman would not take\nthe trouble to look in a pocket or lift a lid.\n\n“Third item. Here and there about the house curious little heaps of\nminute pieces of metal, some like steel springs and some in the form of\nmicroscopic wheels. As if they had gutted some mechanical toy.\n\n“Fourth item. The wax candles, which have to be stuck in bottle necks\nbecause there is nothing else to stick them in. Now I wish you to note\nhow very much queerer all this is than anything we anticipated. For the\ncentral riddle we are prepared; we have all seen at a glance that there\nwas something wrong about the last earl. We have come here to find out\nwhether he really lived here, whether he really died here, whether that\nred-haired scarecrow who did his burying had anything to do with his\ndying. But suppose the worst in all this, the most lurid or melodramatic\nsolution you like. Suppose the servant really killed the master, or\nsuppose the master isn’t really dead, or suppose the master is dressed\nup as the servant, or suppose the servant is buried for the master;\ninvent what Wilkie Collins’ tragedy you like, and you still have not\nexplained a candle without a candlestick, or why an elderly gentleman of\ngood family should habitually spill snuff on the piano. The core of\nthe tale we could imagine; it is the fringes that are mysterious. By no\nstretch of fancy can the human mind connect together snuff and diamonds\nand wax and loose clockwork.”\n\n“I think I see the connection,” said the priest. “This Glengyle was\nmad against the French Revolution. He was an enthusiast for the ancien\nregime, and was trying to re-enact literally the family life of the last\nBourbons. He had snuff because it was the eighteenth century luxury;\nwax candles, because they were the eighteenth century lighting; the\nmechanical bits of iron represent the locksmith hobby of Louis XVI; the\ndiamonds are for the Diamond Necklace of Marie Antoinette.”\n\nBoth the other men were staring at him with round eyes. “What a\nperfectly extraordinary notion!” cried Flambeau. “Do you really think\nthat is the truth?”\n\n“I am perfectly sure it isn’t,” answered Father Brown, “only you said\nthat nobody could connect snuff and diamonds and clockwork and candles.\nI give you that connection off-hand. The real truth, I am very sure,\nlies deeper.”\n\nHe paused a moment and listened to the wailing of the wind in the\nturrets. Then he said, “The late Earl of Glengyle was a thief. He lived\na second and darker life as a desperate housebreaker. He did not have\nany candlesticks because he only used these candles cut short in the\nlittle lantern he carried. The snuff he employed as the fiercest French\ncriminals have used pepper: to fling it suddenly in dense masses in\nthe face of a captor or pursuer. But the final proof is in the curious\ncoincidence of the diamonds and the small steel wheels. Surely that\nmakes everything plain to you? Diamonds and small steel wheels are the\nonly two instruments with which you can cut out a pane of glass.”\n\nThe bough of a broken pine tree lashed heavily in the blast against the\nwindowpane behind them, as if in parody of a burglar, but they did not\nturn round. Their eyes were fastened on Father Brown.\n\n“Diamonds and small wheels,” repeated Craven ruminating. “Is that all\nthat makes you think it the true explanation?”\n\n“I don’t think it the true explanation,” replied the priest placidly;\n“but you said that nobody could connect the four things. The true\ntale, of course, is something much more humdrum. Glengyle had found,\nor thought he had found, precious stones on his estate. Somebody had\nbamboozled him with those loose brilliants, saying they were found in\nthe castle caverns. The little wheels are some diamond-cutting affair.\nHe had to do the thing very roughly and in a small way, with the help of\na few shepherds or rude fellows on these hills. Snuff is the one great\nluxury of such Scotch shepherds; it’s the one thing with which you can\nbribe them. They didn’t have candlesticks because they didn’t want them;\nthey held the candles in their hands when they explored the caves.”\n\n“Is that all?” asked Flambeau after a long pause. “Have we got to the\ndull truth at last?”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Father Brown.\n\nAs the wind died in the most distant pine woods with a long hoot as of\nmockery Father Brown, with an utterly impassive face, went on:\n\n“I only suggested that because you said one could not plausibly\nconnect snuff with clockwork or candles with bright stones. Ten false\nphilosophies will fit the universe; ten false theories will fit Glengyle\nCastle. But we want the real explanation of the castle and the universe.\nBut are there no other exhibits?”\n\nCraven laughed, and Flambeau rose smiling to his feet and strolled down\nthe long table.\n\n“Items five, six, seven, etc.,” he said, “and certainly more varied than\ninstructive. A curious collection, not of lead pencils, but of the lead\nout of lead pencils. A senseless stick of bamboo, with the top rather\nsplintered. It might be the instrument of the crime. Only, there isn’t\nany crime. The only other things are a few old missals and little\nCatholic pictures, which the Ogilvies kept, I suppose, from the Middle\nAges--their family pride being stronger than their Puritanism. We\nonly put them in the museum because they seem curiously cut about and\ndefaced.”\n\nThe heady tempest without drove a dreadful wrack of clouds across\nGlengyle and threw the long room into darkness as Father Brown picked up\nthe little illuminated pages to examine them. He spoke before the drift\nof darkness had passed; but it was the voice of an utterly new man.\n\n“Mr. Craven,” said he, talking like a man ten years younger, “you have\ngot a legal warrant, haven’t you, to go up and examine that grave?\nThe sooner we do it the better, and get to the bottom of this horrible\naffair. If I were you I should start now.”\n\n“Now,” repeated the astonished detective, “and why now?”\n\n“Because this is serious,” answered Brown; “this is not spilt snuff or\nloose pebbles, that might be there for a hundred reasons. There is only\none reason I know of for this being done; and the reason goes down to\nthe roots of the world. These religious pictures are not just dirtied\nor torn or scrawled over, which might be done in idleness or bigotry, by\nchildren or by Protestants. These have been treated very carefully--and\nvery queerly. In every place where the great ornamented name of God\ncomes in the old illuminations it has been elaborately taken out. The\nonly other thing that has been removed is the halo round the head of the\nChild Jesus. Therefore, I say, let us get our warrant and our spade and\nour hatchet, and go up and break open that coffin.”\n\n“What do you mean?” demanded the London officer.\n\n“I mean,” answered the little priest, and his voice seemed to rise\nslightly in the roar of the gale. “I mean that the great devil of the\nuniverse may be sitting on the top tower of this castle at this moment,\nas big as a hundred elephants, and roaring like the Apocalypse. There is\nblack magic somewhere at the bottom of this.”\n\n“Black magic,” repeated Flambeau in a low voice, for he was too\nenlightened a man not to know of such things; “but what can these other\nthings mean?”\n\n“Oh, something damnable, I suppose,” replied Brown impatiently. “How\nshould I know? How can I guess all their mazes down below? Perhaps you\ncan make a torture out of snuff and bamboo. Perhaps lunatics lust after\nwax and steel filings. Perhaps there is a maddening drug made of lead\npencils! Our shortest cut to the mystery is up the hill to the grave.”\n\nHis comrades hardly knew that they had obeyed and followed him till a\nblast of the night wind nearly flung them on their faces in the garden.\nNevertheless they had obeyed him like automata; for Craven found\na hatchet in his hand, and the warrant in his pocket; Flambeau was\ncarrying the heavy spade of the strange gardener; Father Brown was\ncarrying the little gilt book from which had been torn the name of God.\n\nThe path up the hill to the churchyard was crooked but short; only under\nthat stress of wind it seemed laborious and long. Far as the eye could\nsee, farther and farther as they mounted the slope, were seas beyond\nseas of pines, now all aslope one way under the wind. And that universal\ngesture seemed as vain as it was vast, as vain as if that wind were\nwhistling about some unpeopled and purposeless planet. Through all that\ninfinite growth of grey-blue forests sang, shrill and high, that ancient\nsorrow that is in the heart of all heathen things. One could fancy that\nthe voices from the under world of unfathomable foliage were cries of\nthe lost and wandering pagan gods: gods who had gone roaming in that\nirrational forest, and who will never find their way back to heaven.\n\n“You see,” said Father Brown in low but easy tone, “Scotch people before\nScotland existed were a curious lot. In fact, they’re a curious lot\nstill. But in the prehistoric times I fancy they really worshipped\ndemons. That,” he added genially, “is why they jumped at the Puritan\ntheology.”\n\n“My friend,” said Flambeau, turning in a kind of fury, “what does all\nthat snuff mean?”\n\n“My friend,” replied Brown, with equal seriousness, “there is one mark\nof all genuine religions: materialism. Now, devil-worship is a perfectly\ngenuine religion.”\n\nThey had come up on the grassy scalp of the hill, one of the few bald\nspots that stood clear of the crashing and roaring pine forest. A mean\nenclosure, partly timber and partly wire, rattled in the tempest to tell\nthem the border of the graveyard. But by the time Inspector Craven had\ncome to the corner of the grave, and Flambeau had planted his spade\npoint downwards and leaned on it, they were both almost as shaken as the\nshaky wood and wire. At the foot of the grave grew great tall\nthistles, grey and silver in their decay. Once or twice, when a ball\nof thistledown broke under the breeze and flew past him, Craven jumped\nslightly as if it had been an arrow.\n\nFlambeau drove the blade of his spade through the whistling grass into\nthe wet clay below. Then he seemed to stop and lean on it as on a staff.\n\n“Go on,” said the priest very gently. “We are only trying to find the\ntruth. What are you afraid of?”\n\n“I am afraid of finding it,” said Flambeau.\n\nThe London detective spoke suddenly in a high crowing voice that was\nmeant to be conversational and cheery. “I wonder why he really did hide\nhimself like that. Something nasty, I suppose; was he a leper?”\n\n“Something worse than that,” said Flambeau.\n\n“And what do you imagine,” asked the other, “would be worse than a\nleper?”\n\n“I don’t imagine it,” said Flambeau.\n\nHe dug for some dreadful minutes in silence, and then said in a choked\nvoice, “I’m afraid of his not being the right shape.”\n\n“Nor was that piece of paper, you know,” said Father Brown quietly, “and\nwe survived even that piece of paper.”\n\nFlambeau dug on with a blind energy. But the tempest had shouldered away\nthe choking grey clouds that clung to the hills like smoke and revealed\ngrey fields of faint starlight before he cleared the shape of a rude\ntimber coffin, and somehow tipped it up upon the turf. Craven stepped\nforward with his axe; a thistle-top touched him, and he flinched. Then\nhe took a firmer stride, and hacked and wrenched with an energy like\nFlambeau’s till the lid was torn off, and all that was there lay\nglimmering in the grey starlight.\n\n“Bones,” said Craven; and then he added, “but it is a man,” as if that\nwere something unexpected.\n\n“Is he,” asked Flambeau in a voice that went oddly up and down, “is he\nall right?”\n\n“Seems so,” said the officer huskily, bending over the obscure and\ndecaying skeleton in the box. “Wait a minute.”\n\nA vast heave went over Flambeau’s huge figure. “And now I come to think\nof it,” he cried, “why in the name of madness shouldn’t he be all right?\nWhat is it gets hold of a man on these cursed cold mountains? I think\nit’s the black, brainless repetition; all these forests, and over all\nan ancient horror of unconsciousness. It’s like the dream of an atheist.\nPine-trees and more pine-trees and millions more pine-trees--”\n\n“God!” cried the man by the coffin, “but he hasn’t got a head.”\n\nWhile the others stood rigid the priest, for the first time, showed a\nleap of startled concern.\n\n“No head!” he repeated. “No head?” as if he had almost expected some\nother deficiency.\n\nHalf-witted visions of a headless baby born to Glengyle, of a headless\nyouth hiding himself in the castle, of a headless man pacing those\nancient halls or that gorgeous garden, passed in panorama through their\nminds. But even in that stiffened instant the tale took no root in them\nand seemed to have no reason in it. They stood listening to the loud\nwoods and the shrieking sky quite foolishly, like exhausted animals.\nThought seemed to be something enormous that had suddenly slipped out of\ntheir grasp.\n\n“There are three headless men,” said Father Brown, “standing round this\nopen grave.”\n\nThe pale detective from London opened his mouth to speak, and left it\nopen like a yokel, while a long scream of wind tore the sky; then he\nlooked at the axe in his hands as if it did not belong to him, and\ndropped it.\n\n“Father,” said Flambeau in that infantile and heavy voice he used very\nseldom, “what are we to do?”\n\nHis friend’s reply came with the pent promptitude of a gun going off.\n\n“Sleep!” cried Father Brown. “Sleep. We have come to the end of the\nways. Do you know what sleep is? Do you know that every man who sleeps\nbelieves in God? It is a sacrament; for it is an act of faith and it is\na food. And we need a sacrament, if only a natural one. Something has\nfallen on us that falls very seldom on men; perhaps the worst thing that\ncan fall on them.”\n\nCraven’s parted lips came together to say, “What do you mean?”\n\nThe priest had turned his face to the castle as he answered: “We have\nfound the truth; and the truth makes no sense.”\n\nHe went down the path in front of them with a plunging and reckless\nstep very rare with him, and when they reached the castle again he threw\nhimself upon sleep with the simplicity of a dog.\n\nDespite his mystic praise of slumber, Father Brown was up earlier than\nanyone else except the silent gardener; and was found smoking a big\npipe and watching that expert at his speechless labours in the kitchen\ngarden. Towards daybreak the rocking storm had ended in roaring rains,\nand the day came with a curious freshness. The gardener seemed even\nto have been conversing, but at sight of the detectives he planted\nhis spade sullenly in a bed and, saying something about his breakfast,\nshifted along the lines of cabbages and shut himself in the kitchen.\n“He’s a valuable man, that,” said Father Brown. “He does the potatoes\namazingly. Still,” he added, with a dispassionate charity, “he has his\nfaults; which of us hasn’t? He doesn’t dig this bank quite regularly.\nThere, for instance,” and he stamped suddenly on one spot. “I’m really\nvery doubtful about that potato.”\n\n“And why?” asked Craven, amused with the little man’s hobby.\n\n“I’m doubtful about it,” said the other, “because old Gow was doubtful\nabout it himself. He put his spade in methodically in every place but\njust this. There must be a mighty fine potato just here.”\n\nFlambeau pulled up the spade and impetuously drove it into the place.\nHe turned up, under a load of soil, something that did not look like a\npotato, but rather like a monstrous, over-domed mushroom. But it struck\nthe spade with a cold click; it rolled over like a ball, and grinned up\nat them.\n\n“The Earl of Glengyle,” said Brown sadly, and looked down heavily at the\nskull.\n\nThen, after a momentary meditation, he plucked the spade from Flambeau,\nand, saying “We must hide it again,” clamped the skull down in the\nearth. Then he leaned his little body and huge head on the great handle\nof the spade, that stood up stiffly in the earth, and his eyes were\nempty and his forehead full of wrinkles. “If one could only conceive,”\n he muttered, “the meaning of this last monstrosity.” And leaning on\nthe large spade handle, he buried his brows in his hands, as men do in\nchurch.\n\nAll the corners of the sky were brightening into blue and silver; the\nbirds were chattering in the tiny garden trees; so loud it seemed as if\nthe trees themselves were talking. But the three men were silent enough.\n\n“Well, I give it all up,” said Flambeau at last boisterously. “My brain\nand this world don’t fit each other; and there’s an end of it. Snuff,\nspoilt Prayer Books, and the insides of musical boxes--what--”\n\nBrown threw up his bothered brow and rapped on the spade handle with an\nintolerance quite unusual with him. “Oh, tut, tut, tut, tut!” he\ncried. “All that is as plain as a pikestaff. I understood the snuff\nand clockwork, and so on, when I first opened my eyes this morning. And\nsince then I’ve had it out with old Gow, the gardener, who is neither so\ndeaf nor so stupid as he pretends. There’s nothing amiss about the loose\nitems. I was wrong about the torn mass-book, too; there’s no harm in\nthat. But it’s this last business. Desecrating graves and stealing dead\nmen’s heads--surely there’s harm in that? Surely there’s black magic\nstill in that? That doesn’t fit in to the quite simple story of the\nsnuff and the candles.” And, striding about again, he smoked moodily.\n\n“My friend,” said Flambeau, with a grim humour, “you must be careful\nwith me and remember I was once a criminal. The great advantage of that\nestate was that I always made up the story myself, and acted it as quick\nas I chose. This detective business of waiting about is too much for my\nFrench impatience. All my life, for good or evil, I have done things at\nthe instant; I always fought duels the next morning; I always paid bills\non the nail; I never even put off a visit to the dentist--”\n\nFather Brown’s pipe fell out of his mouth and broke into three pieces\non the gravel path. He stood rolling his eyes, the exact picture of\nan idiot. “Lord, what a turnip I am!” he kept saying. “Lord, what a\nturnip!” Then, in a somewhat groggy kind of way, he began to laugh.\n\n“The dentist!” he repeated. “Six hours in the spiritual abyss, and all\nbecause I never thought of the dentist! Such a simple, such a beautiful\nand peaceful thought! Friends, we have passed a night in hell; but now\nthe sun is risen, the birds are singing, and the radiant form of the\ndentist consoles the world.”\n\n“I will get some sense out of this,” cried Flambeau, striding forward,\n“if I use the tortures of the Inquisition.”\n\nFather Brown repressed what appeared to be a momentary disposition to\ndance on the now sunlit lawn and cried quite piteously, like a child,\n“Oh, let me be silly a little. You don’t know how unhappy I have been.\nAnd now I know that there has been no deep sin in this business at all.\nOnly a little lunacy, perhaps--and who minds that?”\n\nHe spun round once more, then faced them with gravity.\n\n“This is not a story of crime,” he said; “rather it is the story of a\nstrange and crooked honesty. We are dealing with the one man on earth,\nperhaps, who has taken no more than his due. It is a study in the savage\nliving logic that has been the religion of this race.\n\n“That old local rhyme about the house of Glengyle--\n\n     As green sap to the simmer trees\n     Is red gold to the Ogilvies--\n\nwas literal as well as metaphorical. It did not merely mean that the\nGlengyles sought for wealth; it was also true that they literally\ngathered gold; they had a huge collection of ornaments and utensils in\nthat metal. They were, in fact, misers whose mania took that turn.\nIn the light of that fact, run through all the things we found in the\ncastle. Diamonds without their gold rings; candles without their gold\ncandlesticks; snuff without the gold snuff-boxes; pencil-leads without\nthe gold pencil-cases; a walking stick without its gold top; clockwork\nwithout the gold clocks--or rather watches. And, mad as it sounds,\nbecause the halos and the name of God in the old missals were of real\ngold; these also were taken away.”\n\nThe garden seemed to brighten, the grass to grow gayer in the\nstrengthening sun, as the crazy truth was told. Flambeau lit a cigarette\nas his friend went on.\n\n“Were taken away,” continued Father Brown; “were taken away--but not\nstolen. Thieves would never have left this mystery. Thieves would have\ntaken the gold snuff-boxes, snuff and all; the gold pencil-cases, lead\nand all. We have to deal with a man with a peculiar conscience, but\ncertainly a conscience. I found that mad moralist this morning in the\nkitchen garden yonder, and I heard the whole story.\n\n“The late Archibald Ogilvie was the nearest approach to a good man\never born at Glengyle. But his bitter virtue took the turn of the\nmisanthrope; he moped over the dishonesty of his ancestors, from which,\nsomehow, he generalised a dishonesty of all men. More especially he\ndistrusted philanthropy or free-giving; and he swore if he could\nfind one man who took his exact rights he should have all the gold of\nGlengyle. Having delivered this defiance to humanity he shut himself\nup, without the smallest expectation of its being answered. One day,\nhowever, a deaf and seemingly senseless lad from a distant village\nbrought him a belated telegram; and Glengyle, in his acrid pleasantry,\ngave him a new farthing. At least he thought he had done so, but when\nhe turned over his change he found the new farthing still there and a\nsovereign gone. The accident offered him vistas of sneering speculation.\nEither way, the boy would show the greasy greed of the species. Either\nhe would vanish, a thief stealing a coin; or he would sneak back with\nit virtuously, a snob seeking a reward. In the middle of that night Lord\nGlengyle was knocked up out of his bed--for he lived alone--and forced\nto open the door to the deaf idiot. The idiot brought with him, not\nthe sovereign, but exactly nineteen shillings and eleven-pence\nthree-farthings in change.\n\n“Then the wild exactitude of this action took hold of the mad lord’s\nbrain like fire. He swore he was Diogenes, that had long sought an\nhonest man, and at last had found one. He made a new will, which I have\nseen. He took the literal youth into his huge, neglected house, and\ntrained him up as his solitary servant and--after an odd manner--his\nheir. And whatever that queer creature understands, he understood\nabsolutely his lord’s two fixed ideas: first, that the letter of right\nis everything; and second, that he himself was to have the gold of\nGlengyle. So far, that is all; and that is simple. He has stripped the\nhouse of gold, and taken not a grain that was not gold; not so much as\na grain of snuff. He lifted the gold leaf off an old illumination, fully\nsatisfied that he left the rest unspoilt. All that I understood; but I\ncould not understand this skull business. I was really uneasy about that\nhuman head buried among the potatoes. It distressed me--till Flambeau\nsaid the word.\n\n“It will be all right. He will put the skull back in the grave, when he\nhas taken the gold out of the tooth.”\n\nAnd, indeed, when Flambeau crossed the hill that morning, he saw that\nstrange being, the just miser, digging at the desecrated grave, the\nplaid round his throat thrashing out in the mountain wind; the sober top\nhat on his head.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wrong Shape\n\n\nCertain of the great roads going north out of London continue far into\nthe country a sort of attenuated and interrupted spectre of a street,\nwith great gaps in the building, but preserving the line. Here will be a\ngroup of shops, followed by a fenced field or paddock, and then a famous\npublic-house, and then perhaps a market garden or a nursery garden, and\nthen one large private house, and then another field and another inn,\nand so on. If anyone walks along one of these roads he will pass a house\nwhich will probably catch his eye, though he may not be able to explain\nits attraction. It is a long, low house, running parallel with the road,\npainted mostly white and pale green, with a veranda and sun-blinds, and\nporches capped with those quaint sort of cupolas like wooden umbrellas\nthat one sees in some old-fashioned houses. In fact, it is an\nold-fashioned house, very English and very suburban in the good old\nwealthy Clapham sense. And yet the house has a look of having been built\nchiefly for the hot weather. Looking at its white paint and sun-blinds\none thinks vaguely of pugarees and even of palm trees. I cannot trace\nthe feeling to its root; perhaps the place was built by an Anglo-Indian.\n\nAnyone passing this house, I say, would be namelessly fascinated by it;\nwould feel that it was a place about which some story was to be told.\nAnd he would have been right, as you shall shortly hear. For this is the\nstory--the story of the strange things that did really happen in it in\nthe Whitsuntide of the year 18--:\n\nAnyone passing the house on the Thursday before Whit-Sunday at about\nhalf-past four p.m. would have seen the front door open, and Father\nBrown, of the small church of St. Mungo, come out smoking a large pipe\nin company with a very tall French friend of his called Flambeau, who\nwas smoking a very small cigarette. These persons may or may not be of\ninterest to the reader, but the truth is that they were not the only\ninteresting things that were displayed when the front door of the\nwhite-and-green house was opened. There are further peculiarities about\nthis house, which must be described to start with, not only that the\nreader may understand this tragic tale, but also that he may realise\nwhat it was that the opening of the door revealed.\n\nThe whole house was built upon the plan of a T, but a T with a very long\ncross piece and a very short tail piece. The long cross piece was the\nfrontage that ran along in face of the street, with the front door\nin the middle; it was two stories high, and contained nearly all\nthe important rooms. The short tail piece, which ran out at the back\nimmediately opposite the front door, was one story high, and consisted\nonly of two long rooms, the one leading into the other. The first of\nthese two rooms was the study in which the celebrated Mr. Quinton wrote\nhis wild Oriental poems and romances. The farther room was a glass\nconservatory full of tropical blossoms of quite unique and almost\nmonstrous beauty, and on such afternoons as these glowing with gorgeous\nsunlight. Thus when the hall door was open, many a passer-by literally\nstopped to stare and gasp; for he looked down a perspective of rich\napartments to something really like a transformation scene in a fairy\nplay: purple clouds and golden suns and crimson stars that were at once\nscorchingly vivid and yet transparent and far away.\n\nLeonard Quinton, the poet, had himself most carefully arranged this\neffect; and it is doubtful whether he so perfectly expressed his\npersonality in any of his poems. For he was a man who drank and bathed\nin colours, who indulged his lust for colour somewhat to the neglect\nof form--even of good form. This it was that had turned his genius\nso wholly to eastern art and imagery; to those bewildering carpets\nor blinding embroideries in which all the colours seem fallen into a\nfortunate chaos, having nothing to typify or to teach. He had attempted,\nnot perhaps with complete artistic success, but with acknowledged\nimagination and invention, to compose epics and love stories reflecting\nthe riot of violent and even cruel colour; tales of tropical heavens\nof burning gold or blood-red copper; of eastern heroes who rode with\ntwelve-turbaned mitres upon elephants painted purple or peacock green;\nof gigantic jewels that a hundred negroes could not carry, but which\nburned with ancient and strange-hued fires.\n\nIn short (to put the matter from the more common point of view), he\ndealt much in eastern heavens, rather worse than most western hells; in\neastern monarchs, whom we might possibly call maniacs; and in eastern\njewels which a Bond Street jeweller (if the hundred staggering negroes\nbrought them into his shop) might possibly not regard as genuine.\nQuinton was a genius, if a morbid one; and even his morbidity appeared\nmore in his life than in his work. In temperament he was weak and\nwaspish, and his health had suffered heavily from oriental experiments\nwith opium. His wife--a handsome, hard-working, and, indeed, over-worked\nwoman objected to the opium, but objected much more to a live Indian\nhermit in white and yellow robes, whom her husband insisted on\nentertaining for months together, a Virgil to guide his spirit through\nthe heavens and the hells of the east.\n\nIt was out of this artistic household that Father Brown and his friend\nstepped on to the door-step; and to judge from their faces, they stepped\nout of it with much relief. Flambeau had known Quinton in wild student\ndays in Paris, and they had renewed the acquaintance for a week-end; but\napart from Flambeau’s more responsible developments of late, he did not\nget on well with the poet now. Choking oneself with opium and writing\nlittle erotic verses on vellum was not his notion of how a gentleman\nshould go to the devil. As the two paused on the door-step, before\ntaking a turn in the garden, the front garden gate was thrown open with\nviolence, and a young man with a billycock hat on the back of his head\ntumbled up the steps in his eagerness. He was a dissipated-looking youth\nwith a gorgeous red necktie all awry, as if he had slept in it, and he\nkept fidgeting and lashing about with one of those little jointed canes.\n\n“I say,” he said breathlessly, “I want to see old Quinton. I must see\nhim. Has he gone?”\n\n“Mr. Quinton is in, I believe,” said Father Brown, cleaning his pipe,\n“but I do not know if you can see him. The doctor is with him at\npresent.”\n\nThe young man, who seemed not to be perfectly sober, stumbled into the\nhall; and at the same moment the doctor came out of Quinton’s study,\nshutting the door and beginning to put on his gloves.\n\n“See Mr. Quinton?” said the doctor coolly. “No, I’m afraid you can’t. In\nfact, you mustn’t on any account. Nobody must see him; I’ve just given\nhim his sleeping draught.”\n\n“No, but look here, old chap,” said the youth in the red tie, trying\naffectionately to capture the doctor by the lapels of his coat. “Look\nhere. I’m simply sewn up, I tell you. I--”\n\n“It’s no good, Mr. Atkinson,” said the doctor, forcing him to fall back;\n“when you can alter the effects of a drug I’ll alter my decision,” and,\nsettling on his hat, he stepped out into the sunlight with the other\ntwo. He was a bull-necked, good-tempered little man with a small\nmoustache, inexpressibly ordinary, yet giving an impression of capacity.\n\nThe young man in the billycock, who did not seem to be gifted with any\ntact in dealing with people beyond the general idea of clutching hold of\ntheir coats, stood outside the door, as dazed as if he had been thrown\nout bodily, and silently watched the other three walk away together\nthrough the garden.\n\n“That was a sound, spanking lie I told just now,” remarked the medical\nman, laughing. “In point of fact, poor Quinton doesn’t have his sleeping\ndraught for nearly half an hour. But I’m not going to have him bothered\nwith that little beast, who only wants to borrow money that he wouldn’t\npay back if he could. He’s a dirty little scamp, though he is Mrs.\nQuinton’s brother, and she’s as fine a woman as ever walked.”\n\n“Yes,” said Father Brown. “She’s a good woman.”\n\n“So I propose to hang about the garden till the creature has cleared\noff,” went on the doctor, “and then I’ll go in to Quinton with the\nmedicine. Atkinson can’t get in, because I locked the door.”\n\n“In that case, Dr. Harris,” said Flambeau, “we might as well walk round\nat the back by the end of the conservatory. There’s no entrance to it\nthat way, but it’s worth seeing, even from the outside.”\n\n“Yes, and I might get a squint at my patient,” laughed the doctor, “for\nhe prefers to lie on an ottoman right at the end of the conservatory\namid all those blood-red poinsettias; it would give me the creeps. But\nwhat are you doing?”\n\nFather Brown had stopped for a moment, and picked up out of the long\ngrass, where it had almost been wholly hidden, a queer, crooked Oriental\nknife, inlaid exquisitely in coloured stones and metals.\n\n“What is this?” asked Father Brown, regarding it with some disfavour.\n\n“Oh, Quinton’s, I suppose,” said Dr. Harris carelessly; “he has all\nsorts of Chinese knickknacks about the place. Or perhaps it belongs to\nthat mild Hindoo of his whom he keeps on a string.”\n\n“What Hindoo?” asked Father Brown, still staring at the dagger in his\nhand.\n\n“Oh, some Indian conjuror,” said the doctor lightly; “a fraud, of\ncourse.”\n\n“You don’t believe in magic?” asked Father Brown, without looking up.\n\n“O crickey! magic!” said the doctor.\n\n“It’s very beautiful,” said the priest in a low, dreaming voice; “the\ncolours are very beautiful. But it’s the wrong shape.”\n\n“What for?” asked Flambeau, staring.\n\n“For anything. It’s the wrong shape in the abstract. Don’t you ever feel\nthat about Eastern art? The colours are intoxicatingly lovely; but the\nshapes are mean and bad--deliberately mean and bad. I have seen wicked\nthings in a Turkey carpet.”\n\n“Mon Dieu!” cried Flambeau, laughing.\n\n“They are letters and symbols in a language I don’t know; but I know\nthey stand for evil words,” went on the priest, his voice growing lower\nand lower. “The lines go wrong on purpose--like serpents doubling to\nescape.”\n\n“What the devil are you talking about?” said the doctor with a loud\nlaugh.\n\nFlambeau spoke quietly to him in answer. “The Father sometimes gets this\nmystic’s cloud on him,” he said; “but I give you fair warning that I\nhave never known him to have it except when there was some evil quite\nnear.”\n\n“Oh, rats!” said the scientist.\n\n“Why, look at it,” cried Father Brown, holding out the crooked knife at\narm’s length, as if it were some glittering snake. “Don’t you see it is\nthe wrong shape? Don’t you see that it has no hearty and plain purpose?\nIt does not point like a spear. It does not sweep like a scythe. It does\nnot look like a weapon. It looks like an instrument of torture.”\n\n“Well, as you don’t seem to like it,” said the jolly Harris, “it had\nbetter be taken back to its owner. Haven’t we come to the end of this\nconfounded conservatory yet? This house is the wrong shape, if you\nlike.”\n\n“You don’t understand,” said Father Brown, shaking his head. “The shape\nof this house is quaint--it is even laughable. But there is nothing\nwrong about it.”\n\nAs they spoke they came round the curve of glass that ended the\nconservatory, an uninterrupted curve, for there was neither door nor\nwindow by which to enter at that end. The glass, however, was clear, and\nthe sun still bright, though beginning to set; and they could see not\nonly the flamboyant blossoms inside, but the frail figure of the poet\nin a brown velvet coat lying languidly on the sofa, having, apparently,\nfallen half asleep over a book. He was a pale, slight man, with loose,\nchestnut hair and a fringe of beard that was the paradox of his face,\nfor the beard made him look less manly. These traits were well known\nto all three of them; but even had it not been so, it may be doubted\nwhether they would have looked at Quinton just then. Their eyes were\nriveted on another object.\n\nExactly in their path, immediately outside the round end of the glass\nbuilding, was standing a tall man, whose drapery fell to his feet in\nfaultless white, and whose bare, brown skull, face, and neck gleamed in\nthe setting sun like splendid bronze. He was looking through the glass\nat the sleeper, and he was more motionless than a mountain.\n\n“Who is that?” cried Father Brown, stepping back with a hissing intake\nof his breath.\n\n“Oh, it is only that Hindoo humbug,” growled Harris; “but I don’t know\nwhat the deuce he’s doing here.”\n\n“It looks like hypnotism,” said Flambeau, biting his black moustache.\n\n“Why are you unmedical fellows always talking bosh about hypnotism?”\n cried the doctor. “It looks a deal more like burglary.”\n\n“Well, we will speak to it, at any rate,” said Flambeau, who was always\nfor action. One long stride took him to the place where the Indian\nstood. Bowing from his great height, which overtopped even the\nOriental’s, he said with placid impudence:\n\n“Good evening, sir. Do you want anything?”\n\nQuite slowly, like a great ship turning into a harbour, the great yellow\nface turned, and looked at last over its white shoulder. They were\nstartled to see that its yellow eyelids were quite sealed, as in sleep.\n“Thank you,” said the face in excellent English. “I want nothing.” Then,\nhalf opening the lids, so as to show a slit of opalescent eyeball,\nhe repeated, “I want nothing.” Then he opened his eyes wide with a\nstartling stare, said, “I want nothing,” and went rustling away into the\nrapidly darkening garden.\n\n“The Christian is more modest,” muttered Father Brown; “he wants\nsomething.”\n\n“What on earth was he doing?” asked Flambeau, knitting his black brows\nand lowering his voice.\n\n“I should like to talk to you later,” said Father Brown.\n\nThe sunlight was still a reality, but it was the red light of evening,\nand the bulk of the garden trees and bushes grew blacker and blacker\nagainst it. They turned round the end of the conservatory, and walked in\nsilence down the other side to get round to the front door. As they went\nthey seemed to wake something, as one startles a bird, in the deeper\ncorner between the study and the main building; and again they saw the\nwhite-robed fakir slide out of the shadow, and slip round towards the\nfront door. To their surprise, however, he had not been alone.\nThey found themselves abruptly pulled up and forced to banish their\nbewilderment by the appearance of Mrs. Quinton, with her heavy golden\nhair and square pale face, advancing on them out of the twilight. She\nlooked a little stern, but was entirely courteous.\n\n“Good evening, Dr. Harris,” was all she said.\n\n“Good evening, Mrs. Quinton,” said the little doctor heartily. “I am\njust going to give your husband his sleeping draught.”\n\n“Yes,” she said in a clear voice. “I think it is quite time.” And she\nsmiled at them, and went sweeping into the house.\n\n“That woman’s over-driven,” said Father Brown; “that’s the kind of woman\nthat does her duty for twenty years, and then does something dreadful.”\n\nThe little doctor looked at him for the first time with an eye of\ninterest. “Did you ever study medicine?” he asked.\n\n“You have to know something of the mind as well as the body,” answered\nthe priest; “we have to know something of the body as well as the mind.”\n\n“Well,” said the doctor, “I think I’ll go and give Quinton his stuff.”\n\nThey had turned the corner of the front facade, and were approaching the\nfront doorway. As they turned into it they saw the man in the white robe\nfor the third time. He came so straight towards the front door that\nit seemed quite incredible that he had not just come out of the study\nopposite to it. Yet they knew that the study door was locked.\n\nFather Brown and Flambeau, however, kept this weird contradiction to\nthemselves, and Dr. Harris was not a man to waste his thoughts on the\nimpossible. He permitted the omnipresent Asiatic to make his exit, and\nthen stepped briskly into the hall. There he found a figure which he had\nalready forgotten. The inane Atkinson was still hanging about, humming\nand poking things with his knobby cane. The doctor’s face had a spasm of\ndisgust and decision, and he whispered rapidly to his companion: “I must\nlock the door again, or this rat will get in. But I shall be out again\nin two minutes.”\n\nHe rapidly unlocked the door and locked it again behind him, just\nbalking a blundering charge from the young man in the billycock. The\nyoung man threw himself impatiently on a hall chair. Flambeau looked at\na Persian illumination on the wall; Father Brown, who seemed in a sort\nof daze, dully eyed the door. In about four minutes the door was opened\nagain. Atkinson was quicker this time. He sprang forward, held the door\nopen for an instant, and called out: “Oh, I say, Quinton, I want--”\n\nFrom the other end of the study came the clear voice of Quinton, in\nsomething between a yawn and a yell of weary laughter.\n\n“Oh, I know what you want. Take it, and leave me in peace. I’m writing a\nsong about peacocks.”\n\nBefore the door closed half a sovereign came flying through the\naperture; and Atkinson, stumbling forward, caught it with singular\ndexterity.\n\n“So that’s settled,” said the doctor, and, locking the door savagely, he\nled the way out into the garden.\n\n“Poor Leonard can get a little peace now,” he added to Father Brown;\n“he’s locked in all by himself for an hour or two.”\n\n“Yes,” answered the priest; “and his voice sounded jolly enough when we\nleft him.” Then he looked gravely round the garden, and saw the loose\nfigure of Atkinson standing and jingling the half-sovereign in his\npocket, and beyond, in the purple twilight, the figure of the Indian\nsitting bolt upright upon a bank of grass with his face turned towards\nthe setting sun. Then he said abruptly: “Where is Mrs. Quinton!”\n\n“She has gone up to her room,” said the doctor. “That is her shadow on\nthe blind.”\n\nFather Brown looked up, and frowningly scrutinised a dark outline at the\ngas-lit window.\n\n“Yes,” he said, “that is her shadow,” and he walked a yard or two and\nthrew himself upon a garden seat.\n\nFlambeau sat down beside him; but the doctor was one of those energetic\npeople who live naturally on their legs. He walked away, smoking, into\nthe twilight, and the two friends were left together.\n\n“My father,” said Flambeau in French, “what is the matter with you?”\n\nFather Brown was silent and motionless for half a minute, then he said:\n“Superstition is irreligious, but there is something in the air of this\nplace. I think it’s that Indian--at least, partly.”\n\nHe sank into silence, and watched the distant outline of the Indian, who\nstill sat rigid as if in prayer. At first sight he seemed motionless,\nbut as Father Brown watched him he saw that the man swayed ever so\nslightly with a rhythmic movement, just as the dark tree-tops swayed\never so slightly in the wind that was creeping up the dim garden paths\nand shuffling the fallen leaves a little.\n\nThe landscape was growing rapidly dark, as if for a storm, but they\ncould still see all the figures in their various places. Atkinson was\nleaning against a tree with a listless face; Quinton’s wife was still\nat her window; the doctor had gone strolling round the end of the\nconservatory; they could see his cigar like a will-o’-the-wisp; and the\nfakir still sat rigid and yet rocking, while the trees above him began\nto rock and almost to roar. Storm was certainly coming.\n\n“When that Indian spoke to us,” went on Brown in a conversational\nundertone, “I had a sort of vision, a vision of him and all his\nuniverse. Yet he only said the same thing three times. When first he\nsaid ‘I want nothing,’ it meant only that he was impenetrable, that Asia\ndoes not give itself away. Then he said again, ‘I want nothing,’ and\nI knew that he meant that he was sufficient to himself, like a cosmos,\nthat he needed no God, neither admitted any sins. And when he said the\nthird time, ‘I want nothing,’ he said it with blazing eyes. And I knew\nthat he meant literally what he said; that nothing was his desire and\nhis home; that he was weary for nothing as for wine; that annihilation,\nthe mere destruction of everything or anything--”\n\nTwo drops of rain fell; and for some reason Flambeau started and looked\nup, as if they had stung him. And the same instant the doctor down by\nthe end of the conservatory began running towards them, calling out\nsomething as he ran.\n\nAs he came among them like a bombshell the restless Atkinson happened to\nbe taking a turn nearer to the house front; and the doctor clutched him\nby the collar in a convulsive grip. “Foul play!” he cried; “what have\nyou been doing to him, you dog?”\n\nThe priest had sprung erect, and had the voice of steel of a soldier in\ncommand.\n\n“No fighting,” he cried coolly; “we are enough to hold anyone we want\nto. What is the matter, doctor?”\n\n“Things are not right with Quinton,” said the doctor, quite white. “I\ncould just see him through the glass, and I don’t like the way he’s\nlying. It’s not as I left him, anyhow.”\n\n“Let us go in to him,” said Father Brown shortly. “You can leave Mr.\nAtkinson alone. I have had him in sight since we heard Quinton’s voice.”\n\n“I will stop here and watch him,” said Flambeau hurriedly. “You go in\nand see.”\n\nThe doctor and the priest flew to the study door, unlocked it, and fell\ninto the room. In doing so they nearly fell over the large mahogany\ntable in the centre at which the poet usually wrote; for the place was\nlit only by a small fire kept for the invalid. In the middle of this\ntable lay a single sheet of paper, evidently left there on purpose. The\ndoctor snatched it up, glanced at it, handed it to Father Brown, and\ncrying, “Good God, look at that!” plunged toward the glass room beyond,\nwhere the terrible tropic flowers still seemed to keep a crimson memory\nof the sunset.\n\nFather Brown read the words three times before he put down the paper.\nThe words were: “I die by my own hand; yet I die murdered!” They were\nin the quite inimitable, not to say illegible, handwriting of Leonard\nQuinton.\n\nThen Father Brown, still keeping the paper in his hand, strode towards\nthe conservatory, only to meet his medical friend coming back with a\nface of assurance and collapse. “He’s done it,” said Harris.\n\nThey went together through the gorgeous unnatural beauty of cactus\nand azalea and found Leonard Quinton, poet and romancer, with his head\nhanging downward off his ottoman and his red curls sweeping the ground.\nInto his left side was thrust the queer dagger that they had picked up\nin the garden, and his limp hand still rested on the hilt.\n\nOutside the storm had come at one stride, like the night in Coleridge,\nand garden and glass roof were darkened with driving rain. Father Brown\nseemed to be studying the paper more than the corpse; he held it close\nto his eyes; and seemed trying to read it in the twilight. Then he held\nit up against the faint light, and, as he did so, lightning stared at\nthem for an instant so white that the paper looked black against it.\n\nDarkness full of thunder followed, and after the thunder Father Brown’s\nvoice said out of the dark: “Doctor, this paper is the wrong shape.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Doctor Harris, with a frowning stare.\n\n“It isn’t square,” answered Brown. “It has a sort of edge snipped off at\nthe corner. What does it mean?”\n\n“How the deuce should I know?” growled the doctor. “Shall we move this\npoor chap, do you think? He’s quite dead.”\n\n“No,” answered the priest; “we must leave him as he lies and send for\nthe police.” But he was still scrutinising the paper.\n\nAs they went back through the study he stopped by the table and picked\nup a small pair of nail scissors. “Ah,” he said, with a sort of relief,\n“this is what he did it with. But yet--” And he knitted his brows.\n\n“Oh, stop fooling with that scrap of paper,” said the doctor\nemphatically. “It was a fad of his. He had hundreds of them. He cut all\nhis paper like that,” as he pointed to a stack of sermon paper still\nunused on another and smaller table. Father Brown went up to it and held\nup a sheet. It was the same irregular shape.\n\n“Quite so,” he said. “And here I see the corners that were snipped off.”\n And to the indignation of his colleague he began to count them.\n\n“That’s all right,” he said, with an apologetic smile. “Twenty-three\nsheets cut and twenty-two corners cut off them. And as I see you are\nimpatient we will rejoin the others.”\n\n“Who is to tell his wife?” asked Dr. Harris. “Will you go and tell her\nnow, while I send a servant for the police?”\n\n“As you will,” said Father Brown indifferently. And he went out to the\nhall door.\n\nHere also he found a drama, though of a more grotesque sort. It showed\nnothing less than his big friend Flambeau in an attitude to which he\nhad long been unaccustomed, while upon the pathway at the bottom of the\nsteps was sprawling with his boots in the air the amiable Atkinson, his\nbillycock hat and walking cane sent flying in opposite directions along\nthe path. Atkinson had at length wearied of Flambeau’s almost paternal\ncustody, and had endeavoured to knock him down, which was by no means a\nsmooth game to play with the Roi des Apaches, even after that monarch’s\nabdication.\n\nFlambeau was about to leap upon his enemy and secure him once more, when\nthe priest patted him easily on the shoulder.\n\n“Make it up with Mr. Atkinson, my friend,” he said. “Beg a mutual pardon\nand say ‘Good night.’ We need not detain him any longer.” Then, as\nAtkinson rose somewhat doubtfully and gathered his hat and stick and\nwent towards the garden gate, Father Brown said in a more serious voice:\n“Where is that Indian?”\n\nThey all three (for the doctor had joined them) turned involuntarily\ntowards the dim grassy bank amid the tossing trees purple with twilight,\nwhere they had last seen the brown man swaying in his strange prayers.\nThe Indian was gone.\n\n“Confound him,” cried the doctor, stamping furiously. “Now I know that\nit was that nigger that did it.”\n\n“I thought you didn’t believe in magic,” said Father Brown quietly.\n\n“No more I did,” said the doctor, rolling his eyes. “I only know that\nI loathed that yellow devil when I thought he was a sham wizard. And I\nshall loathe him more if I come to think he was a real one.”\n\n“Well, his having escaped is nothing,” said Flambeau. “For we could\nhave proved nothing and done nothing against him. One hardly goes to\nthe parish constable with a story of suicide imposed by witchcraft or\nauto-suggestion.”\n\nMeanwhile Father Brown had made his way into the house, and now went to\nbreak the news to the wife of the dead man.\n\nWhen he came out again he looked a little pale and tragic, but what\npassed between them in that interview was never known, even when all was\nknown.\n\nFlambeau, who was talking quietly with the doctor, was surprised to see\nhis friend reappear so soon at his elbow; but Brown took no notice, and\nmerely drew the doctor apart. “You have sent for the police, haven’t\nyou?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” answered Harris. “They ought to be here in ten minutes.”\n\n“Will you do me a favour?” said the priest quietly. “The truth is, I\nmake a collection of these curious stories, which often contain, as in\nthe case of our Hindoo friend, elements which can hardly be put into a\npolice report. Now, I want you to write out a report of this case for\nmy private use. Yours is a clever trade,” he said, looking the doctor\ngravely and steadily in the face. “I sometimes think that you know some\ndetails of this matter which you have not thought fit to mention. Mine\nis a confidential trade like yours, and I will treat anything you write\nfor me in strict confidence. But write the whole.”\n\nThe doctor, who had been listening thoughtfully with his head a little\non one side, looked the priest in the face for an instant, and said:\n“All right,” and went into the study, closing the door behind him.\n\n“Flambeau,” said Father Brown, “there is a long seat there under the\nveranda, where we can smoke out of the rain. You are my only friend in\nthe world, and I want to talk to you. Or, perhaps, be silent with you.”\n\nThey established themselves comfortably in the veranda seat; Father\nBrown, against his common habit, accepted a good cigar and smoked it\nsteadily in silence, while the rain shrieked and rattled on the roof of\nthe veranda.\n\n“My friend,” he said at length, “this is a very queer case. A very queer\ncase.”\n\n“I should think it was,” said Flambeau, with something like a shudder.\n\n“You call it queer, and I call it queer,” said the other, “and yet\nwe mean quite opposite things. The modern mind always mixes up two\ndifferent ideas: mystery in the sense of what is marvellous, and mystery\nin the sense of what is complicated. That is half its difficulty about\nmiracles. A miracle is startling; but it is simple. It is simple because\nit is a miracle. It is power coming directly from God (or the devil)\ninstead of indirectly through nature or human wills. Now, you mean that\nthis business is marvellous because it is miraculous, because it is\nwitchcraft worked by a wicked Indian. Understand, I do not say that\nit was not spiritual or diabolic. Heaven and hell only know by what\nsurrounding influences strange sins come into the lives of men. But for\nthe present my point is this: If it was pure magic, as you think,\nthen it is marvellous; but it is not mysterious--that is, it is not\ncomplicated. The quality of a miracle is mysterious, but its manner\nis simple. Now, the manner of this business has been the reverse of\nsimple.”\n\nThe storm that had slackened for a little seemed to be swelling again,\nand there came heavy movements as of faint thunder. Father Brown let\nfall the ash of his cigar and went on:\n\n“There has been in this incident,” he said, “a twisted, ugly, complex\nquality that does not belong to the straight bolts either of heaven\nor hell. As one knows the crooked track of a snail, I know the crooked\ntrack of a man.”\n\nThe white lightning opened its enormous eye in one wink, the sky shut up\nagain, and the priest went on:\n\n“Of all these crooked things, the crookedest was the shape of that piece\nof paper. It was crookeder than the dagger that killed him.”\n\n“You mean the paper on which Quinton confessed his suicide,” said\nFlambeau.\n\n“I mean the paper on which Quinton wrote, ‘I die by my own hand,’”\n answered Father Brown. “The shape of that paper, my friend, was the\nwrong shape; the wrong shape, if ever I have seen it in this wicked\nworld.”\n\n“It only had a corner snipped off,” said Flambeau, “and I understand\nthat all Quinton’s paper was cut that way.”\n\n“It was a very odd way,” said the other, “and a very bad way, to my\ntaste and fancy. Look here, Flambeau, this Quinton--God receive his\nsoul!--was perhaps a bit of a cur in some ways, but he really was an\nartist, with the pencil as well as the pen. His handwriting, though hard\nto read, was bold and beautiful. I can’t prove what I say; I can’t prove\nanything. But I tell you with the full force of conviction that he could\nnever have cut that mean little piece off a sheet of paper. If he had\nwanted to cut down paper for some purpose of fitting in, or binding\nup, or what not, he would have made quite a different slash with the\nscissors. Do you remember the shape? It was a mean shape. It was a wrong\nshape. Like this. Don’t you remember?”\n\nAnd he waved his burning cigar before him in the darkness, making\nirregular squares so rapidly that Flambeau really seemed to see them as\nfiery hieroglyphics upon the darkness--hieroglyphics such as his friend\nhad spoken of, which are undecipherable, yet can have no good meaning.\n\n“But,” said Flambeau, as the priest put his cigar in his mouth again\nand leaned back, staring at the roof, “suppose somebody else did use the\nscissors. Why should somebody else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper,\nmake Quinton commit suicide?”\n\nFather Brown was still leaning back and staring at the roof, but he took\nhis cigar out of his mouth and said: “Quinton never did commit suicide.”\n\nFlambeau stared at him. “Why, confound it all,” he cried, “then why did\nhe confess to suicide?”\n\nThe priest leant forward again, settled his elbows on his knees, looked\nat the ground, and said, in a low, distinct voice: “He never did confess\nto suicide.”\n\nFlambeau laid his cigar down. “You mean,” he said, “that the writing was\nforged?”\n\n“No,” said Father Brown. “Quinton wrote it all right.”\n\n“Well, there you are,” said the aggravated Flambeau; “Quinton wrote, ‘I\ndie by my own hand,’ with his own hand on a plain piece of paper.”\n\n“Of the wrong shape,” said the priest calmly.\n\n“Oh, the shape be damned!” cried Flambeau. “What has the shape to do\nwith it?”\n\n“There were twenty-three snipped papers,” resumed Brown unmoved, “and\nonly twenty-two pieces snipped off. Therefore one of the pieces had\nbeen destroyed, probably that from the written paper. Does that suggest\nanything to you?”\n\nA light dawned on Flambeau’s face, and he said: “There was something\nelse written by Quinton, some other words. ‘They will tell you I die by\nmy own hand,’ or ‘Do not believe that--’”\n\n“Hotter, as the children say,” said his friend. “But the piece was\nhardly half an inch across; there was no room for one word, let alone\nfive. Can you think of anything hardly bigger than a comma which the man\nwith hell in his heart had to tear away as a testimony against him?”\n\n“I can think of nothing,” said Flambeau at last.\n\n“What about quotation marks?” said the priest, and flung his cigar far\ninto the darkness like a shooting star.\n\nAll words had left the other man’s mouth, and Father Brown said, like\none going back to fundamentals:\n\n“Leonard Quinton was a romancer, and was writing an Oriental romance\nabout wizardry and hypnotism. He--”\n\nAt this moment the door opened briskly behind them, and the doctor came\nout with his hat on. He put a long envelope into the priest’s hands.\n\n“That’s the document you wanted,” he said, “and I must be getting home.\nGood night.”\n\n“Good night,” said Father Brown, as the doctor walked briskly to the\ngate. He had left the front door open, so that a shaft of gaslight fell\nupon them. In the light of this Brown opened the envelope and read the\nfollowing words:\n\n\n\n    DEAR FATHER BROWN,--Vicisti Galilee. Otherwise, damn your\n    eyes, which are very penetrating ones. Can it be possible that\n    there is something in all that stuff of yours after all?\n\n\n    I am a man who has ever since boyhood believed in Nature and\n    in all natural functions and instincts, whether men called them\n    moral or immoral. Long before I became a doctor, when I was a\n    schoolboy keeping mice and spiders, I believed that to be a good\n    animal is the best thing in the world. But just now I am shaken;\n    I have believed in Nature; but it seems as if Nature could betray\n    a man. Can there be anything in your bosh? I am really getting\n    morbid.\n\n\n    I loved Quinton’s wife. What was there wrong in that? Nature\n    told me to, and it’s love that makes the world go round. I also\n    thought quite sincerely that she would be happier with a clean\n    animal like me than with that tormenting little lunatic. What was\n    there wrong in that? I was only facing facts, like a man of\n    science. She would have been happier.\n\n\n    According to my own creed I was quite free to kill Quinton,\n    which was the best thing for everybody, even himself. But as a\n    healthy animal I had no notion of killing myself. I resolved,\n    therefore, that I would never do it until I saw a chance that\n    would leave me scot free. I saw that chance this morning.\n\n\n    I have been three times, all told, into Quinton’s study today.\n    The first time I went in he would talk about nothing but the weird\n    tale, called “The Cure of a Saint,” which he was writing, which\n    was all about how some Indian hermit made an English colonel kill\n    himself by thinking about him. He showed me the last sheets, and\n    even read me the last paragraph, which was something like this:\n    “The conqueror of the Punjab, a mere yellow skeleton, but still\n    gigantic, managed to lift himself on his elbow and gasp in his\n    nephew’s ear: ‘I die by my own hand, yet I die murdered!’” It so\n    happened by one chance out of a hundred, that those last words\n    were written at the top of a new sheet of paper. I left the room,\n    and went out into the garden intoxicated with a frightful\n    opportunity.\n\n\n    We walked round the house; and two more things happened in my\n    favour. You suspected an Indian, and you found a dagger which the\n    Indian might most probably use. Taking the opportunity to stuff\n    it in my pocket I went back to Quinton’s study, locked the door,\n    and gave him his sleeping draught. He was against answering\n    Atkinson at all, but I urged him to call out and quiet the fellow,\n    because I wanted a clear proof that Quinton was alive when I left\n    the room for the second time. Quinton lay down in the conservatory,\n    and I came through the study. I am a quick man with my hands, and\n    in a minute and a half I had done what I wanted to do. I had\n    emptied all the first part of Quinton’s romance into the fireplace,\n    where it burnt to ashes. Then I saw that the quotation marks\n    wouldn’t do, so I snipped them off, and to make it seem likelier,\n    snipped the whole quire to match. Then I came out with the\n    knowledge that Quinton’s confession of suicide lay on the front\n    table, while Quinton lay alive but asleep in the conservatory\n    beyond.\n\n\n    The last act was a desperate one; you can guess it: I pretended\n    to have seen Quinton dead and rushed to his room. I delayed you\n    with the paper, and, being a quick man with my hands, killed\n    Quinton while you were looking at his confession of suicide. He\n    was half-asleep, being drugged, and I put his own hand on the\n    knife and drove it into his body. The knife was of so queer a\n    shape that no one but an operator could have calculated the angle\n    that would reach his heart. I wonder if you noticed this.\n\n\n    When I had done it, the extraordinary thing happened. Nature\n    deserted me. I felt ill. I felt just as if I had done something\n    wrong. I think my brain is breaking up; I feel some sort of\n    desperate pleasure in thinking I have told the thing to somebody;\n    that I shall not have to be alone with it if I marry and have\n    children. What is the matter with me?... Madness... or can one\n    have remorse, just as if one were in Byron’s poems! I cannot\n    write any more.\n\n                   James Erskine Harris.\n\n\nFather Brown carefully folded up the letter, and put it in his breast\npocket just as there came a loud peal at the gate bell, and the wet\nwaterproofs of several policemen gleamed in the road outside.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sins of Prince Saradine\n\n\nWhen Flambeau took his month’s holiday from his office in Westminster\nhe took it in a small sailing-boat, so small that it passed much of its\ntime as a rowing-boat. He took it, moreover, in little rivers in the\nEastern counties, rivers so small that the boat looked like a magic\nboat, sailing on land through meadows and cornfields. The vessel was\njust comfortable for two people; there was room only for necessities,\nand Flambeau had stocked it with such things as his special philosophy\nconsidered necessary. They reduced themselves, apparently, to four\nessentials: tins of salmon, if he should want to eat; loaded revolvers,\nif he should want to fight; a bottle of brandy, presumably in case he\nshould faint; and a priest, presumably in case he should die. With this\nlight luggage he crawled down the little Norfolk rivers, intending to\nreach the Broads at last, but meanwhile delighting in the overhanging\ngardens and meadows, the mirrored mansions or villages, lingering to\nfish in the pools and corners, and in some sense hugging the shore.\n\nLike a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, like a\ntrue philosopher, he had an excuse. He had a sort of half purpose, which\nhe took just so seriously that its success would crown the holiday, but\njust so lightly that its failure would not spoil it. Years ago, when he\nhad been a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had\noften received wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even\nlove; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of\na visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark. On the back of\nthe card was written in French and in green ink: “If you ever retire and\nbecome respectable, come and see me. I want to meet you, for I have met\nall the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one\ndetective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French\nhistory.” On the front of the card was engraved in the formal fashion,\n“Prince Saradine, Reed House, Reed Island, Norfolk.”\n\nHe had not troubled much about the prince then, beyond ascertaining that\nhe had been a brilliant and fashionable figure in southern Italy. In his\nyouth, it was said, he had eloped with a married woman of high rank; the\nescapade was scarcely startling in his social world, but it had clung to\nmen’s minds because of an additional tragedy: the alleged suicide of the\ninsulted husband, who appeared to have flung himself over a precipice in\nSicily. The prince then lived in Vienna for a time, but his more recent\nyears seemed to have been passed in perpetual and restless travel. But\nwhen Flambeau, like the prince himself, had left European celebrity\nand settled in England, it occurred to him that he might pay a surprise\nvisit to this eminent exile in the Norfolk Broads. Whether he should\nfind the place he had no idea; and, indeed, it was sufficiently small\nand forgotten. But, as things fell out, he found it much sooner than he\nexpected.\n\nThey had moored their boat one night under a bank veiled in high grasses\nand short pollarded trees. Sleep, after heavy sculling, had come to them\nearly, and by a corresponding accident they awoke before it was light.\nTo speak more strictly, they awoke before it was daylight; for a large\nlemon moon was only just setting in the forest of high grass above their\nheads, and the sky was of a vivid violet-blue, nocturnal but bright.\nBoth men had simultaneously a reminiscence of childhood, of the elfin\nand adventurous time when tall weeds close over us like woods. Standing\nup thus against the large low moon, the daisies really seemed to\nbe giant daisies, the dandelions to be giant dandelions. Somehow it\nreminded them of the dado of a nursery wall-paper. The drop of the\nriver-bed sufficed to sink them under the roots of all shrubs and\nflowers and make them gaze upwards at the grass. “By Jove!” said\nFlambeau, “it’s like being in fairyland.”\n\nFather Brown sat bolt upright in the boat and crossed himself. His\nmovement was so abrupt that his friend asked him, with a mild stare,\nwhat was the matter.\n\n“The people who wrote the mediaeval ballads,” answered the priest, “knew\nmore about fairies than you do. It isn’t only nice things that happen in\nfairyland.”\n\n“Oh, bosh!” said Flambeau. “Only nice things could happen under such an\ninnocent moon. I am for pushing on now and seeing what does really come.\nWe may die and rot before we ever see again such a moon or such a mood.”\n\n“All right,” said Father Brown. “I never said it was always wrong to\nenter fairyland. I only said it was always dangerous.”\n\nThey pushed slowly up the brightening river; the glowing violet of the\nsky and the pale gold of the moon grew fainter and fainter, and faded\ninto that vast colourless cosmos that precedes the colours of the dawn.\nWhen the first faint stripes of red and gold and grey split the horizon\nfrom end to end they were broken by the black bulk of a town or village\nwhich sat on the river just ahead of them. It was already an easy\ntwilight, in which all things were visible, when they came under the\nhanging roofs and bridges of this riverside hamlet. The houses, with\ntheir long, low, stooping roofs, seemed to come down to drink at the\nriver, like huge grey and red cattle. The broadening and whitening\ndawn had already turned to working daylight before they saw any living\ncreature on the wharves and bridges of that silent town. Eventually they\nsaw a very placid and prosperous man in his shirt sleeves, with a face\nas round as the recently sunken moon, and rays of red whisker around the\nlow arc of it, who was leaning on a post above the sluggish tide. By\nan impulse not to be analysed, Flambeau rose to his full height in the\nswaying boat and shouted at the man to ask if he knew Reed Island or\nReed House. The prosperous man’s smile grew slightly more expansive,\nand he simply pointed up the river towards the next bend of it. Flambeau\nwent ahead without further speech.\n\nThe boat took many such grassy corners and followed many such reedy and\nsilent reaches of river; but before the search had become monotonous\nthey had swung round a specially sharp angle and come into the silence\nof a sort of pool or lake, the sight of which instinctively arrested\nthem. For in the middle of this wider piece of water, fringed on every\nside with rushes, lay a long, low islet, along which ran a long, low\nhouse or bungalow built of bamboo or some kind of tough tropic cane.\nThe upstanding rods of bamboo which made the walls were pale yellow, the\nsloping rods that made the roof were of darker red or brown, otherwise\nthe long house was a thing of repetition and monotony. The early morning\nbreeze rustled the reeds round the island and sang in the strange ribbed\nhouse as in a giant pan-pipe.\n\n“By George!” cried Flambeau; “here is the place, after all! Here is Reed\nIsland, if ever there was one. Here is Reed House, if it is anywhere. I\nbelieve that fat man with whiskers was a fairy.”\n\n“Perhaps,” remarked Father Brown impartially. “If he was, he was a bad\nfairy.”\n\nBut even as he spoke the impetuous Flambeau had run his boat ashore in\nthe rattling reeds, and they stood in the long, quaint islet beside the\nodd and silent house.\n\nThe house stood with its back, as it were, to the river and the only\nlanding-stage; the main entrance was on the other side, and looked down\nthe long island garden. The visitors approached it, therefore, by a\nsmall path running round nearly three sides of the house, close under\nthe low eaves. Through three different windows on three different sides\nthey looked in on the same long, well-lit room, panelled in light wood,\nwith a large number of looking-glasses, and laid out as for an elegant\nlunch. The front door, when they came round to it at last, was flanked\nby two turquoise-blue flower pots. It was opened by a butler of the\ndrearier type--long, lean, grey and listless--who murmured that Prince\nSaradine was from home at present, but was expected hourly; the house\nbeing kept ready for him and his guests. The exhibition of the card with\nthe scrawl of green ink awoke a flicker of life in the parchment face of\nthe depressed retainer, and it was with a certain shaky courtesy that\nhe suggested that the strangers should remain. “His Highness may be here\nany minute,” he said, “and would be distressed to have just missed any\ngentleman he had invited. We have orders always to keep a little cold\nlunch for him and his friends, and I am sure he would wish it to be\noffered.”\n\nMoved with curiosity to this minor adventure, Flambeau assented\ngracefully, and followed the old man, who ushered him ceremoniously into\nthe long, lightly panelled room. There was nothing very notable about\nit, except the rather unusual alternation of many long, low windows with\nmany long, low oblongs of looking-glass, which gave a singular air\nof lightness and unsubstantialness to the place. It was somehow like\nlunching out of doors. One or two pictures of a quiet kind hung in the\ncorners, one a large grey photograph of a very young man in uniform,\nanother a red chalk sketch of two long-haired boys. Asked by Flambeau\nwhether the soldierly person was the prince, the butler answered shortly\nin the negative; it was the prince’s younger brother, Captain Stephen\nSaradine, he said. And with that the old man seemed to dry up suddenly\nand lose all taste for conversation.\n\nAfter lunch had tailed off with exquisite coffee and liqueurs,\nthe guests were introduced to the garden, the library, and the\nhousekeeper--a dark, handsome lady, of no little majesty, and rather\nlike a plutonic Madonna. It appeared that she and the butler were\nthe only survivors of the prince’s original foreign menage the other\nservants now in the house being new and collected in Norfolk by the\nhousekeeper. This latter lady went by the name of Mrs. Anthony, but\nshe spoke with a slight Italian accent, and Flambeau did not doubt that\nAnthony was a Norfolk version of some more Latin name. Mr. Paul,\nthe butler, also had a faintly foreign air, but he was in tongue and\ntraining English, as are many of the most polished men-servants of the\ncosmopolitan nobility.\n\nPretty and unique as it was, the place had about it a curious luminous\nsadness. Hours passed in it like days. The long, well-windowed rooms\nwere full of daylight, but it seemed a dead daylight. And through all\nother incidental noises, the sound of talk, the clink of glasses, or the\npassing feet of servants, they could hear on all sides of the house the\nmelancholy noise of the river.\n\n“We have taken a wrong turning, and come to a wrong place,” said Father\nBrown, looking out of the window at the grey-green sedges and the silver\nflood. “Never mind; one can sometimes do good by being the right person\nin the wrong place.”\n\nFather Brown, though commonly a silent, was an oddly sympathetic little\nman, and in those few but endless hours he unconsciously sank deeper\ninto the secrets of Reed House than his professional friend. He had that\nknack of friendly silence which is so essential to gossip; and saying\nscarcely a word, he probably obtained from his new acquaintances all\nthat in any case they would have told. The butler indeed was naturally\nuncommunicative. He betrayed a sullen and almost animal affection\nfor his master; who, he said, had been very badly treated. The chief\noffender seemed to be his highness’s brother, whose name alone would\nlengthen the old man’s lantern jaws and pucker his parrot nose into a\nsneer. Captain Stephen was a ne’er-do-well, apparently, and had drained\nhis benevolent brother of hundreds and thousands; forced him to fly from\nfashionable life and live quietly in this retreat. That was all Paul,\nthe butler, would say, and Paul was obviously a partisan.\n\nThe Italian housekeeper was somewhat more communicative, being, as Brown\nfancied, somewhat less content. Her tone about her master was faintly\nacid; though not without a certain awe. Flambeau and his friend were\nstanding in the room of the looking-glasses examining the red sketch\nof the two boys, when the housekeeper swept in swiftly on some domestic\nerrand. It was a peculiarity of this glittering, glass-panelled place\nthat anyone entering was reflected in four or five mirrors at once; and\nFather Brown, without turning round, stopped in the middle of a sentence\nof family criticism. But Flambeau, who had his face close up to the\npicture, was already saying in a loud voice, “The brothers Saradine, I\nsuppose. They both look innocent enough. It would be hard to say which\nis the good brother and which the bad.” Then, realising the lady’s\npresence, he turned the conversation with some triviality, and strolled\nout into the garden. But Father Brown still gazed steadily at the red\ncrayon sketch; and Mrs. Anthony still gazed steadily at Father Brown.\n\nShe had large and tragic brown eyes, and her olive face glowed darkly\nwith a curious and painful wonder--as of one doubtful of a stranger’s\nidentity or purpose. Whether the little priest’s coat and creed touched\nsome southern memories of confession, or whether she fancied he knew\nmore than he did, she said to him in a low voice as to a fellow plotter,\n“He is right enough in one way, your friend. He says it would be hard\nto pick out the good and bad brothers. Oh, it would be hard, it would be\nmighty hard, to pick out the good one.”\n\n“I don’t understand you,” said Father Brown, and began to move away.\n\nThe woman took a step nearer to him, with thunderous brows and a sort of\nsavage stoop, like a bull lowering his horns.\n\n“There isn’t a good one,” she hissed. “There was badness enough in the\ncaptain taking all that money, but I don’t think there was much goodness\nin the prince giving it. The captain’s not the only one with something\nagainst him.”\n\nA light dawned on the cleric’s averted face, and his mouth formed\nsilently the word “blackmail.” Even as he did so the woman turned an\nabrupt white face over her shoulder and almost fell. The door had opened\nsoundlessly and the pale Paul stood like a ghost in the doorway. By\nthe weird trick of the reflecting walls, it seemed as if five Pauls had\nentered by five doors simultaneously.\n\n“His Highness,” he said, “has just arrived.”\n\nIn the same flash the figure of a man had passed outside the first\nwindow, crossing the sunlit pane like a lighted stage. An instant\nlater he passed at the second window and the many mirrors repainted in\nsuccessive frames the same eagle profile and marching figure. He was\nerect and alert, but his hair was white and his complexion of an odd\nivory yellow. He had that short, curved Roman nose which generally\ngoes with long, lean cheeks and chin, but these were partly masked by\nmoustache and imperial. The moustache was much darker than the beard,\ngiving an effect slightly theatrical, and he was dressed up to the same\ndashing part, having a white top hat, an orchid in his coat, a yellow\nwaistcoat and yellow gloves which he flapped and swung as he walked.\nWhen he came round to the front door they heard the stiff Paul open it,\nand heard the new arrival say cheerfully, “Well, you see I have come.”\n The stiff Mr. Paul bowed and answered in his inaudible manner; for a\nfew minutes their conversation could not be heard. Then the butler said,\n“Everything is at your disposal;” and the glove-flapping Prince Saradine\ncame gaily into the room to greet them. They beheld once more that\nspectral scene--five princes entering a room with five doors.\n\nThe prince put the white hat and yellow gloves on the table and offered\nhis hand quite cordially.\n\n“Delighted to see you here, Mr. Flambeau,” he said. “Knowing you very\nwell by reputation, if that’s not an indiscreet remark.”\n\n“Not at all,” answered Flambeau, laughing. “I am not sensitive. Very few\nreputations are gained by unsullied virtue.”\n\nThe prince flashed a sharp look at him to see if the retort had any\npersonal point; then he laughed also and offered chairs to everyone,\nincluding himself.\n\n“Pleasant little place, this, I think,” he said with a detached air.\n“Not much to do, I fear; but the fishing is really good.”\n\nThe priest, who was staring at him with the grave stare of a baby, was\nhaunted by some fancy that escaped definition. He looked at the grey,\ncarefully curled hair, yellow white visage, and slim, somewhat foppish\nfigure. These were not unnatural, though perhaps a shade prononcé, like\nthe outfit of a figure behind the footlights. The nameless interest\nlay in something else, in the very framework of the face; Brown was\ntormented with a half memory of having seen it somewhere before. The\nman looked like some old friend of his dressed up. Then he suddenly\nremembered the mirrors, and put his fancy down to some psychological\neffect of that multiplication of human masks.\n\nPrince Saradine distributed his social attentions between his guests\nwith great gaiety and tact. Finding the detective of a sporting turn and\neager to employ his holiday, he guided Flambeau and Flambeau’s boat down\nto the best fishing spot in the stream, and was back in his own canoe\nin twenty minutes to join Father Brown in the library and plunge equally\npolitely into the priest’s more philosophic pleasures. He seemed to know\na great deal both about the fishing and the books, though of these not\nthe most edifying; he spoke five or six languages, though chiefly the\nslang of each. He had evidently lived in varied cities and very motley\nsocieties, for some of his cheerfullest stories were about gambling\nhells and opium dens, Australian bushrangers or Italian brigands. Father\nBrown knew that the once-celebrated Saradine had spent his last few\nyears in almost ceaseless travel, but he had not guessed that the\ntravels were so disreputable or so amusing.\n\nIndeed, with all his dignity of a man of the world, Prince Saradine\nradiated to such sensitive observers as the priest, a certain atmosphere\nof the restless and even the unreliable. His face was fastidious, but\nhis eye was wild; he had little nervous tricks, like a man shaken by\ndrink or drugs, and he neither had, nor professed to have, his hand\non the helm of household affairs. All these were left to the two old\nservants, especially to the butler, who was plainly the central pillar\nof the house. Mr. Paul, indeed, was not so much a butler as a sort of\nsteward or, even, chamberlain; he dined privately, but with almost\nas much pomp as his master; he was feared by all the servants; and he\nconsulted with the prince decorously, but somewhat unbendingly--rather\nas if he were the prince’s solicitor. The sombre housekeeper was a mere\nshadow in comparison; indeed, she seemed to efface herself and wait only\non the butler, and Brown heard no more of those volcanic whispers which\nhad half told him of the younger brother who blackmailed the elder.\nWhether the prince was really being thus bled by the absent captain,\nhe could not be certain, but there was something insecure and secretive\nabout Saradine that made the tale by no means incredible.\n\nWhen they went once more into the long hall with the windows and the\nmirrors, yellow evening was dropping over the waters and the willowy\nbanks; and a bittern sounded in the distance like an elf upon his\ndwarfish drum. The same singular sentiment of some sad and evil\nfairyland crossed the priest’s mind again like a little grey cloud. “I\nwish Flambeau were back,” he muttered.\n\n“Do you believe in doom?” asked the restless Prince Saradine suddenly.\n\n“No,” answered his guest. “I believe in Doomsday.”\n\nThe prince turned from the window and stared at him in a singular\nmanner, his face in shadow against the sunset. “What do you mean?” he\nasked.\n\n“I mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry,” answered\nFather Brown. “The things that happen here do not seem to mean anything;\nthey mean something somewhere else. Somewhere else retribution will come\non the real offender. Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person.”\n\nThe prince made an inexplicable noise like an animal; in his shadowed\nface the eyes were shining queerly. A new and shrewd thought exploded\nsilently in the other’s mind. Was there another meaning in Saradine’s\nblend of brilliancy and abruptness? Was the prince--Was he perfectly\nsane? He was repeating, “The wrong person--the wrong person,” many more\ntimes than was natural in a social exclamation.\n\nThen Father Brown awoke tardily to a second truth. In the mirrors before\nhim he could see the silent door standing open, and the silent Mr. Paul\nstanding in it, with his usual pallid impassiveness.\n\n“I thought it better to announce at once,” he said, with the same stiff\nrespectfulness as of an old family lawyer, “a boat rowed by six men\nhas come to the landing-stage, and there’s a gentleman sitting in the\nstern.”\n\n“A boat!” repeated the prince; “a gentleman?” and he rose to his feet.\n\nThere was a startled silence punctuated only by the odd noise of the\nbird in the sedge; and then, before anyone could speak again, a new\nface and figure passed in profile round the three sunlit windows, as\nthe prince had passed an hour or two before. But except for the accident\nthat both outlines were aquiline, they had little in common. Instead\nof the new white topper of Saradine, was a black one of antiquated or\nforeign shape; under it was a young and very solemn face, clean shaven,\nblue about its resolute chin, and carrying a faint suggestion of the\nyoung Napoleon. The association was assisted by something old and odd\nabout the whole get-up, as of a man who had never troubled to change\nthe fashions of his fathers. He had a shabby blue frock coat, a red,\nsoldierly looking waistcoat, and a kind of coarse white trousers common\namong the early Victorians, but strangely incongruous today. From all\nthis old clothes-shop his olive face stood out strangely young and\nmonstrously sincere.\n\n“The deuce!” said Prince Saradine, and clapping on his white hat he went\nto the front door himself, flinging it open on the sunset garden.\n\nBy that time the new-comer and his followers were drawn up on the lawn\nlike a small stage army. The six boatmen had pulled the boat well up on\nshore, and were guarding it almost menacingly, holding their oars erect\nlike spears. They were swarthy men, and some of them wore earrings. But\none of them stood forward beside the olive-faced young man in the red\nwaistcoat, and carried a large black case of unfamiliar form.\n\n“Your name,” said the young man, “is Saradine?”\n\nSaradine assented rather negligently.\n\nThe new-comer had dull, dog-like brown eyes, as different as possible\nfrom the restless and glittering grey eyes of the prince. But once\nagain Father Brown was tortured with a sense of having seen somewhere a\nreplica of the face; and once again he remembered the repetitions of\nthe glass-panelled room, and put down the coincidence to that. “Confound\nthis crystal palace!” he muttered. “One sees everything too many times.\nIt’s like a dream.”\n\n“If you are Prince Saradine,” said the young man, “I may tell you that\nmy name is Antonelli.”\n\n“Antonelli,” repeated the prince languidly. “Somehow I remember the\nname.”\n\n“Permit me to present myself,” said the young Italian.\n\nWith his left hand he politely took off his old-fashioned top-hat; with\nhis right he caught Prince Saradine so ringing a crack across the\nface that the white top hat rolled down the steps and one of the blue\nflower-pots rocked upon its pedestal.\n\nThe prince, whatever he was, was evidently not a coward; he sprang at\nhis enemy’s throat and almost bore him backwards to the grass. But his\nenemy extricated himself with a singularly inappropriate air of hurried\npoliteness.\n\n“That is all right,” he said, panting and in halting English. “I have\ninsulted. I will give satisfaction. Marco, open the case.”\n\nThe man beside him with the earrings and the big black case proceeded\nto unlock it. He took out of it two long Italian rapiers, with splendid\nsteel hilts and blades, which he planted point downwards in the lawn.\nThe strange young man standing facing the entrance with his yellow and\nvindictive face, the two swords standing up in the turf like two crosses\nin a cemetery, and the line of the ranked towers behind, gave it all an\nodd appearance of being some barbaric court of justice. But everything\nelse was unchanged, so sudden had been the interruption. The sunset gold\nstill glowed on the lawn, and the bittern still boomed as announcing\nsome small but dreadful destiny.\n\n“Prince Saradine,” said the man called Antonelli, “when I was an infant\nin the cradle you killed my father and stole my mother; my father was\nthe more fortunate. You did not kill him fairly, as I am going to kill\nyou. You and my wicked mother took him driving to a lonely pass in\nSicily, flung him down a cliff, and went on your way. I could imitate\nyou if I chose, but imitating you is too vile. I have followed you all\nover the world, and you have always fled from me. But this is the end\nof the world--and of you. I have you now, and I give you the chance you\nnever gave my father. Choose one of those swords.”\n\nPrince Saradine, with contracted brows, seemed to hesitate a moment,\nbut his ears were still singing with the blow, and he sprang forward\nand snatched at one of the hilts. Father Brown had also sprung forward,\nstriving to compose the dispute; but he soon found his personal presence\nmade matters worse. Saradine was a French freemason and a fierce\natheist, and a priest moved him by the law of contraries. And for the\nother man neither priest nor layman moved him at all. This young man\nwith the Bonaparte face and the brown eyes was something far sterner\nthan a puritan--a pagan. He was a simple slayer from the morning of the\nearth; a man of the stone age--a man of stone.\n\nOne hope remained, the summoning of the household; and Father Brown ran\nback into the house. He found, however, that all the under servants\nhad been given a holiday ashore by the autocrat Paul, and that only the\nsombre Mrs. Anthony moved uneasily about the long rooms. But the moment\nshe turned a ghastly face upon him, he resolved one of the riddles of\nthe house of mirrors. The heavy brown eyes of Antonelli were the heavy\nbrown eyes of Mrs. Anthony; and in a flash he saw half the story.\n\n“Your son is outside,” he said without wasting words; “either he or the\nprince will be killed. Where is Mr. Paul?”\n\n“He is at the landing-stage,” said the woman faintly. “He is--he\nis--signalling for help.”\n\n“Mrs. Anthony,” said Father Brown seriously, “there is no time for\nnonsense. My friend has his boat down the river fishing. Your son’s boat\nis guarded by your son’s men. There is only this one canoe; what is Mr.\nPaul doing with it?”\n\n“Santa Maria! I do not know,” she said; and swooned all her length on\nthe matted floor.\n\nFather Brown lifted her to a sofa, flung a pot of water over her,\nshouted for help, and then rushed down to the landing-stage of the\nlittle island. But the canoe was already in mid-stream, and old Paul\nwas pulling and pushing it up the river with an energy incredible at his\nyears.\n\n“I will save my master,” he cried, his eyes blazing maniacally. “I will\nsave him yet!”\n\nFather Brown could do nothing but gaze after the boat as it struggled\nup-stream and pray that the old man might waken the little town in time.\n\n“A duel is bad enough,” he muttered, rubbing up his rough dust-coloured\nhair, “but there’s something wrong about this duel, even as a duel. I\nfeel it in my bones. But what can it be?”\n\nAs he stood staring at the water, a wavering mirror of sunset, he\nheard from the other end of the island garden a small but unmistakable\nsound--the cold concussion of steel. He turned his head.\n\nAway on the farthest cape or headland of the long islet, on a strip of\nturf beyond the last rank of roses, the duellists had already crossed\nswords. Evening above them was a dome of virgin gold, and, distant as\nthey were, every detail was picked out. They had cast off their coats,\nbut the yellow waistcoat and white hair of Saradine, the red waistcoat\nand white trousers of Antonelli, glittered in the level light like the\ncolours of the dancing clockwork dolls. The two swords sparkled from\npoint to pommel like two diamond pins. There was something frightful\nin the two figures appearing so little and so gay. They looked like two\nbutterflies trying to pin each other to a cork.\n\nFather Brown ran as hard as he could, his little legs going like a\nwheel. But when he came to the field of combat he found he was born too\nlate and too early--too late to stop the strife, under the shadow of the\ngrim Sicilians leaning on their oars, and too early to anticipate any\ndisastrous issue of it. For the two men were singularly well matched,\nthe prince using his skill with a sort of cynical confidence, the\nSicilian using his with a murderous care. Few finer fencing matches can\never have been seen in crowded amphitheatres than that which tinkled and\nsparkled on that forgotten island in the reedy river. The dizzy fight\nwas balanced so long that hope began to revive in the protesting priest;\nby all common probability Paul must soon come back with the police. It\nwould be some comfort even if Flambeau came back from his fishing, for\nFlambeau, physically speaking, was worth four other men. But there was\nno sign of Flambeau, and, what was much queerer, no sign of Paul or the\npolice. No other raft or stick was left to float on; in that lost\nisland in that vast nameless pool, they were cut off as on a rock in the\nPacific.\n\nAlmost as he had the thought the ringing of the rapiers quickened to a\nrattle, the prince’s arms flew up, and the point shot out behind between\nhis shoulder-blades. He went over with a great whirling movement, almost\nlike one throwing the half of a boy’s cart-wheel. The sword flew from\nhis hand like a shooting star, and dived into the distant river. And\nhe himself sank with so earth-shaking a subsidence that he broke a\nbig rose-tree with his body and shook up into the sky a cloud of red\nearth--like the smoke of some heathen sacrifice. The Sicilian had made\nblood-offering to the ghost of his father.\n\nThe priest was instantly on his knees by the corpse; but only to make\ntoo sure that it was a corpse. As he was still trying some last hopeless\ntests he heard for the first time voices from farther up the river, and\nsaw a police boat shoot up to the landing-stage, with constables and\nother important people, including the excited Paul. The little priest\nrose with a distinctly dubious grimace.\n\n“Now, why on earth,” he muttered, “why on earth couldn’t he have come\nbefore?”\n\nSome seven minutes later the island was occupied by an invasion\nof townsfolk and police, and the latter had put their hands on the\nvictorious duellist, ritually reminding him that anything he said might\nbe used against him.\n\n“I shall not say anything,” said the monomaniac, with a wonderful and\npeaceful face. “I shall never say anything more. I am very happy, and I\nonly want to be hanged.”\n\nThen he shut his mouth as they led him away, and it is the strange but\ncertain truth that he never opened it again in this world, except to say\n“Guilty” at his trial.\n\nFather Brown had stared at the suddenly crowded garden, the arrest of\nthe man of blood, the carrying away of the corpse after its examination\nby the doctor, rather as one watches the break-up of some ugly dream; he\nwas motionless, like a man in a nightmare. He gave his name and address\nas a witness, but declined their offer of a boat to the shore, and\nremained alone in the island garden, gazing at the broken rose bush\nand the whole green theatre of that swift and inexplicable tragedy. The\nlight died along the river; mist rose in the marshy banks; a few belated\nbirds flitted fitfully across.\n\nStuck stubbornly in his sub-consciousness (which was an unusually\nlively one) was an unspeakable certainty that there was something still\nunexplained. This sense that had clung to him all day could not be fully\nexplained by his fancy about “looking-glass land.” Somehow he had not\nseen the real story, but some game or masque. And yet people do not get\nhanged or run through the body for the sake of a charade.\n\nAs he sat on the steps of the landing-stage ruminating he grew conscious\nof the tall, dark streak of a sail coming silently down the shining\nriver, and sprang to his feet with such a backrush of feeling that he\nalmost wept.\n\n“Flambeau!” he cried, and shook his friend by both hands again and\nagain, much to the astonishment of that sportsman, as he came on shore\nwith his fishing tackle. “Flambeau,” he said, “so you’re not killed?”\n\n“Killed!” repeated the angler in great astonishment. “And why should I\nbe killed?”\n\n“Oh, because nearly everybody else is,” said his companion rather\nwildly. “Saradine got murdered, and Antonelli wants to be hanged, and\nhis mother’s fainted, and I, for one, don’t know whether I’m in this\nworld or the next. But, thank God, you’re in the same one.” And he took\nthe bewildered Flambeau’s arm.\n\nAs they turned from the landing-stage they came under the eaves of the\nlow bamboo house, and looked in through one of the windows, as they\nhad done on their first arrival. They beheld a lamp-lit interior well\ncalculated to arrest their eyes. The table in the long dining-room\nhad been laid for dinner when Saradine’s destroyer had fallen like a\nstormbolt on the island. And the dinner was now in placid progress, for\nMrs. Anthony sat somewhat sullenly at the foot of the table, while at\nthe head of it was Mr. Paul, the major domo, eating and drinking of the\nbest, his bleared, bluish eyes standing queerly out of his face, his\ngaunt countenance inscrutable, but by no means devoid of satisfaction.\n\nWith a gesture of powerful impatience, Flambeau rattled at the window,\nwrenched it open, and put an indignant head into the lamp-lit room.\n\n“Well,” he cried. “I can understand you may need some refreshment,\nbut really to steal your master’s dinner while he lies murdered in the\ngarden--”\n\n“I have stolen a great many things in a long and pleasant life,” replied\nthe strange old gentleman placidly; “this dinner is one of the few\nthings I have not stolen. This dinner and this house and garden happen\nto belong to me.”\n\nA thought flashed across Flambeau’s face. “You mean to say,” he began,\n“that the will of Prince Saradine--”\n\n“I am Prince Saradine,” said the old man, munching a salted almond.\n\nFather Brown, who was looking at the birds outside, jumped as if he were\nshot, and put in at the window a pale face like a turnip.\n\n“You are what?” he repeated in a shrill voice.\n\n“Paul, Prince Saradine, A vos ordres,” said the venerable person\npolitely, lifting a glass of sherry. “I live here very quietly, being\na domestic kind of fellow; and for the sake of modesty I am called Mr.\nPaul, to distinguish me from my unfortunate brother Mr. Stephen. He\ndied, I hear, recently--in the garden. Of course, it is not my fault\nif enemies pursue him to this place. It is owing to the regrettable\nirregularity of his life. He was not a domestic character.”\n\nHe relapsed into silence, and continued to gaze at the opposite wall\njust above the bowed and sombre head of the woman. They saw plainly\nthe family likeness that had haunted them in the dead man. Then his old\nshoulders began to heave and shake a little, as if he were choking, but\nhis face did not alter.\n\n“My God!” cried Flambeau after a pause, “he’s laughing!”\n\n“Come away,” said Father Brown, who was quite white. “Come away from\nthis house of hell. Let us get into an honest boat again.”\n\nNight had sunk on rushes and river by the time they had pushed off from\nthe island, and they went down-stream in the dark, warming themselves\nwith two big cigars that glowed like crimson ships’ lanterns. Father\nBrown took his cigar out of his mouth and said:\n\n“I suppose you can guess the whole story now? After all, it’s a\nprimitive story. A man had two enemies. He was a wise man. And so he\ndiscovered that two enemies are better than one.”\n\n“I do not follow that,” answered Flambeau.\n\n“Oh, it’s really simple,” rejoined his friend. “Simple, though anything\nbut innocent. Both the Saradines were scamps, but the prince, the\nelder, was the sort of scamp that gets to the top, and the younger, the\ncaptain, was the sort that sinks to the bottom. This squalid officer\nfell from beggar to blackmailer, and one ugly day he got his hold upon\nhis brother, the prince. Obviously it was for no light matter, for\nPrince Paul Saradine was frankly ‘fast,’ and had no reputation to lose\nas to the mere sins of society. In plain fact, it was a hanging matter,\nand Stephen literally had a rope round his brother’s neck. He had\nsomehow discovered the truth about the Sicilian affair, and could prove\nthat Paul murdered old Antonelli in the mountains. The captain raked in\nthe hush money heavily for ten years, until even the prince’s splendid\nfortune began to look a little foolish.\n\n“But Prince Saradine bore another burden besides his blood-sucking\nbrother. He knew that the son of Antonelli, a mere child at the time of\nthe murder, had been trained in savage Sicilian loyalty, and lived only\nto avenge his father, not with the gibbet (for he lacked Stephen’s legal\nproof), but with the old weapons of vendetta. The boy had practised arms\nwith a deadly perfection, and about the time that he was old enough to\nuse them Prince Saradine began, as the society papers said, to travel.\nThe fact is that he began to flee for his life, passing from place\nto place like a hunted criminal; but with one relentless man upon his\ntrail. That was Prince Paul’s position, and by no means a pretty one.\nThe more money he spent on eluding Antonelli the less he had to silence\nStephen. The more he gave to silence Stephen the less chance there was\nof finally escaping Antonelli. Then it was that he showed himself a\ngreat man--a genius like Napoleon.\n\n“Instead of resisting his two antagonists, he surrendered suddenly to\nboth of them. He gave way like a Japanese wrestler, and his foes fell\nprostrate before him. He gave up the race round the world, and he gave\nup his address to young Antonelli; then he gave up everything to his\nbrother. He sent Stephen money enough for smart clothes and easy travel,\nwith a letter saying roughly: ‘This is all I have left. You have cleaned\nme out. I still have a little house in Norfolk, with servants and a\ncellar, and if you want more from me you must take that. Come and take\npossession if you like, and I will live there quietly as your friend\nor agent or anything.’ He knew that the Sicilian had never seen the\nSaradine brothers save, perhaps, in pictures; he knew they were somewhat\nalike, both having grey, pointed beards. Then he shaved his own face\nand waited. The trap worked. The unhappy captain, in his new clothes,\nentered the house in triumph as a prince, and walked upon the Sicilian’s\nsword.\n\n“There was one hitch, and it is to the honour of human nature. Evil\nspirits like Saradine often blunder by never expecting the virtues of\nmankind. He took it for granted that the Italian’s blow, when it came,\nwould be dark, violent and nameless, like the blow it avenged; that the\nvictim would be knifed at night, or shot from behind a hedge, and so\ndie without speech. It was a bad minute for Prince Paul when Antonelli’s\nchivalry proposed a formal duel, with all its possible explanations. It\nwas then that I found him putting off in his boat with wild eyes. He was\nfleeing, bareheaded, in an open boat before Antonelli should learn who\nhe was.\n\n“But, however agitated, he was not hopeless. He knew the adventurer and\nhe knew the fanatic. It was quite probable that Stephen, the adventurer,\nwould hold his tongue, through his mere histrionic pleasure in playing a\npart, his lust for clinging to his new cosy quarters, his rascal’s\ntrust in luck, and his fine fencing. It was certain that Antonelli, the\nfanatic, would hold his tongue, and be hanged without telling tales\nof his family. Paul hung about on the river till he knew the fight\nwas over. Then he roused the town, brought the police, saw his two\nvanquished enemies taken away forever, and sat down smiling to his\ndinner.”\n\n“Laughing, God help us!” said Flambeau with a strong shudder. “Do they\nget such ideas from Satan?”\n\n“He got that idea from you,” answered the priest.\n\n“God forbid!” ejaculated Flambeau. “From me! What do you mean!”\n\nThe priest pulled a visiting-card from his pocket and held it up in the\nfaint glow of his cigar; it was scrawled with green ink.\n\n“Don’t you remember his original invitation to you?” he asked, “and the\ncompliment to your criminal exploit? ‘That trick of yours,’ he says,\n‘of getting one detective to arrest the other’? He has just copied your\ntrick. With an enemy on each side of him, he slipped swiftly out of the\nway and let them collide and kill each other.”\n\nFlambeau tore Prince Saradine’s card from the priest’s hands and rent it\nsavagely in small pieces.\n\n“There’s the last of that old skull and crossbones,” he said as he\nscattered the pieces upon the dark and disappearing waves of the stream;\n“but I should think it would poison the fishes.”\n\nThe last gleam of white card and green ink was drowned and darkened;\na faint and vibrant colour as of morning changed the sky, and the moon\nbehind the grasses grew paler. They drifted in silence.\n\n“Father,” said Flambeau suddenly, “do you think it was all a dream?”\n\nThe priest shook his head, whether in dissent or agnosticism, but\nremained mute. A smell of hawthorn and of orchards came to them through\nthe darkness, telling them that a wind was awake; the next moment it\nswayed their little boat and swelled their sail, and carried them onward\ndown the winding river to happier places and the homes of harmless men.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hammer of God\n\n\nThe little village of Bohun Beacon was perched on a hill so steep\nthat the tall spire of its church seemed only like the peak of a small\nmountain. At the foot of the church stood a smithy, generally red with\nfires and always littered with hammers and scraps of iron; opposite to\nthis, over a rude cross of cobbled paths, was “The Blue Boar,” the only\ninn of the place. It was upon this crossway, in the lifting of a leaden\nand silver daybreak, that two brothers met in the street and spoke;\nthough one was beginning the day and the other finishing it. The Rev.\nand Hon. Wilfred Bohun was very devout, and was making his way to some\naustere exercises of prayer or contemplation at dawn. Colonel the Hon.\nNorman Bohun, his elder brother, was by no means devout, and was sitting\nin evening dress on the bench outside “The Blue Boar,” drinking what\nthe philosophic observer was free to regard either as his last glass on\nTuesday or his first on Wednesday. The colonel was not particular.\n\nThe Bohuns were one of the very few aristocratic families really dating\nfrom the Middle Ages, and their pennon had actually seen Palestine.\nBut it is a great mistake to suppose that such houses stand high\nin chivalric tradition. Few except the poor preserve traditions.\nAristocrats live not in traditions but in fashions. The Bohuns had been\nMohocks under Queen Anne and Mashers under Queen Victoria. But like more\nthan one of the really ancient houses, they had rotted in the last two\ncenturies into mere drunkards and dandy degenerates, till there had even\ncome a whisper of insanity. Certainly there was something hardly\nhuman about the colonel’s wolfish pursuit of pleasure, and his chronic\nresolution not to go home till morning had a touch of the hideous\nclarity of insomnia. He was a tall, fine animal, elderly, but with\nhair still startlingly yellow. He would have looked merely blonde and\nleonine, but his blue eyes were sunk so deep in his face that they\nlooked black. They were a little too close together. He had very long\nyellow moustaches; on each side of them a fold or furrow from nostril to\njaw, so that a sneer seemed cut into his face. Over his evening clothes\nhe wore a curious pale yellow coat that looked more like a very light\ndressing gown than an overcoat, and on the back of his head was stuck an\nextraordinary broad-brimmed hat of a bright green colour, evidently some\noriental curiosity caught up at random. He was proud of appearing in\nsuch incongruous attires--proud of the fact that he always made them\nlook congruous.\n\nHis brother the curate had also the yellow hair and the elegance, but\nhe was buttoned up to the chin in black, and his face was clean-shaven,\ncultivated, and a little nervous. He seemed to live for nothing but his\nreligion; but there were some who said (notably the blacksmith, who was\na Presbyterian) that it was a love of Gothic architecture rather than of\nGod, and that his haunting of the church like a ghost was only another\nand purer turn of the almost morbid thirst for beauty which sent his\nbrother raging after women and wine. This charge was doubtful, while the\nman’s practical piety was indubitable. Indeed, the charge was mostly an\nignorant misunderstanding of the love of solitude and secret prayer, and\nwas founded on his being often found kneeling, not before the altar, but\nin peculiar places, in the crypts or gallery, or even in the belfry.\nHe was at the moment about to enter the church through the yard of\nthe smithy, but stopped and frowned a little as he saw his brother’s\ncavernous eyes staring in the same direction. On the hypothesis that the\ncolonel was interested in the church he did not waste any speculations.\nThere only remained the blacksmith’s shop, and though the blacksmith was\na Puritan and none of his people, Wilfred Bohun had heard some scandals\nabout a beautiful and rather celebrated wife. He flung a suspicious look\nacross the shed, and the colonel stood up laughing to speak to him.\n\n“Good morning, Wilfred,” he said. “Like a good landlord I am watching\nsleeplessly over my people. I am going to call on the blacksmith.”\n\nWilfred looked at the ground, and said: “The blacksmith is out. He is\nover at Greenford.”\n\n“I know,” answered the other with silent laughter; “that is why I am\ncalling on him.”\n\n“Norman,” said the cleric, with his eye on a pebble in the road, “are\nyou ever afraid of thunderbolts?”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the colonel. “Is your hobby meteorology?”\n\n“I mean,” said Wilfred, without looking up, “do you ever think that God\nmight strike you in the street?”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said the colonel; “I see your hobby is folk-lore.”\n\n“I know your hobby is blasphemy,” retorted the religious man, stung in\nthe one live place of his nature. “But if you do not fear God, you have\ngood reason to fear man.”\n\nThe elder raised his eyebrows politely. “Fear man?” he said.\n\n“Barnes the blacksmith is the biggest and strongest man for forty\nmiles round,” said the clergyman sternly. “I know you are no coward or\nweakling, but he could throw you over the wall.”\n\nThis struck home, being true, and the lowering line by mouth and nostril\ndarkened and deepened. For a moment he stood with the heavy sneer on his\nface. But in an instant Colonel Bohun had recovered his own cruel good\nhumour and laughed, showing two dog-like front teeth under his yellow\nmoustache. “In that case, my dear Wilfred,” he said quite carelessly,\n“it was wise for the last of the Bohuns to come out partially in\narmour.”\n\nAnd he took off the queer round hat covered with green, showing that\nit was lined within with steel. Wilfred recognised it indeed as a light\nJapanese or Chinese helmet torn down from a trophy that hung in the old\nfamily hall.\n\n“It was the first hat to hand,” explained his brother airily; “always\nthe nearest hat--and the nearest woman.”\n\n“The blacksmith is away at Greenford,” said Wilfred quietly; “the time\nof his return is unsettled.”\n\nAnd with that he turned and went into the church with bowed head,\ncrossing himself like one who wishes to be quit of an unclean spirit.\nHe was anxious to forget such grossness in the cool twilight of his tall\nGothic cloisters; but on that morning it was fated that his still round\nof religious exercises should be everywhere arrested by small shocks.\nAs he entered the church, hitherto always empty at that hour, a kneeling\nfigure rose hastily to its feet and came towards the full daylight of\nthe doorway. When the curate saw it he stood still with surprise. For\nthe early worshipper was none other than the village idiot, a nephew of\nthe blacksmith, one who neither would nor could care for the church or\nfor anything else. He was always called “Mad Joe,” and seemed to have\nno other name; he was a dark, strong, slouching lad, with a heavy white\nface, dark straight hair, and a mouth always open. As he passed the\npriest, his moon-calf countenance gave no hint of what he had been doing\nor thinking of. He had never been known to pray before. What sort of\nprayers was he saying now? Extraordinary prayers surely.\n\nWilfred Bohun stood rooted to the spot long enough to see the idiot go\nout into the sunshine, and even to see his dissolute brother hail him\nwith a sort of avuncular jocularity. The last thing he saw was the\ncolonel throwing pennies at the open mouth of Joe, with the serious\nappearance of trying to hit it.\n\nThis ugly sunlit picture of the stupidity and cruelty of the earth sent\nthe ascetic finally to his prayers for purification and new thoughts.\nHe went up to a pew in the gallery, which brought him under a coloured\nwindow which he loved and always quieted his spirit; a blue window\nwith an angel carrying lilies. There he began to think less about the\nhalf-wit, with his livid face and mouth like a fish. He began to think\nless of his evil brother, pacing like a lean lion in his horrible\nhunger. He sank deeper and deeper into those cold and sweet colours of\nsilver blossoms and sapphire sky.\n\nIn this place half an hour afterwards he was found by Gibbs, the village\ncobbler, who had been sent for him in some haste. He got to his feet\nwith promptitude, for he knew that no small matter would have brought\nGibbs into such a place at all. The cobbler was, as in many villages,\nan atheist, and his appearance in church was a shade more extraordinary\nthan Mad Joe’s. It was a morning of theological enigmas.\n\n“What is it?” asked Wilfred Bohun rather stiffly, but putting out a\ntrembling hand for his hat.\n\nThe atheist spoke in a tone that, coming from him, was quite startlingly\nrespectful, and even, as it were, huskily sympathetic.\n\n“You must excuse me, sir,” he said in a hoarse whisper, “but we didn’t\nthink it right not to let you know at once. I’m afraid a rather dreadful\nthing has happened, sir. I’m afraid your brother--”\n\nWilfred clenched his frail hands. “What devilry has he done now?” he\ncried in voluntary passion.\n\n“Why, sir,” said the cobbler, coughing, “I’m afraid he’s done nothing,\nand won’t do anything. I’m afraid he’s done for. You had really better\ncome down, sir.”\n\nThe curate followed the cobbler down a short winding stair which brought\nthem out at an entrance rather higher than the street. Bohun saw the\ntragedy in one glance, flat underneath him like a plan. In the yard\nof the smithy were standing five or six men mostly in black, one in\nan inspector’s uniform. They included the doctor, the Presbyterian\nminister, and the priest from the Roman Catholic chapel, to which the\nblacksmith’s wife belonged. The latter was speaking to her, indeed,\nvery rapidly, in an undertone, as she, a magnificent woman with red-gold\nhair, was sobbing blindly on a bench. Between these two groups, and\njust clear of the main heap of hammers, lay a man in evening dress,\nspread-eagled and flat on his face. From the height above Wilfred could\nhave sworn to every item of his costume and appearance, down to the\nBohun rings upon his fingers; but the skull was only a hideous splash,\nlike a star of blackness and blood.\n\nWilfred Bohun gave but one glance, and ran down the steps into the yard.\nThe doctor, who was the family physician, saluted him, but he scarcely\ntook any notice. He could only stammer out: “My brother is dead. What\ndoes it mean? What is this horrible mystery?” There was an unhappy\nsilence; and then the cobbler, the most outspoken man present, answered:\n“Plenty of horror, sir,” he said; “but not much mystery.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked Wilfred, with a white face.\n\n“It’s plain enough,” answered Gibbs. “There is only one man for forty\nmiles round that could have struck such a blow as that, and he’s the man\nthat had most reason to.”\n\n“We must not prejudge anything,” put in the doctor, a tall,\nblack-bearded man, rather nervously; “but it is competent for me to\ncorroborate what Mr. Gibbs says about the nature of the blow, sir; it\nis an incredible blow. Mr. Gibbs says that only one man in this district\ncould have done it. I should have said myself that nobody could have\ndone it.”\n\nA shudder of superstition went through the slight figure of the curate.\n“I can hardly understand,” he said.\n\n“Mr. Bohun,” said the doctor in a low voice, “metaphors literally fail\nme. It is inadequate to say that the skull was smashed to bits like an\neggshell. Fragments of bone were driven into the body and the ground\nlike bullets into a mud wall. It was the hand of a giant.”\n\nHe was silent a moment, looking grimly through his glasses; then he\nadded: “The thing has one advantage--that it clears most people of\nsuspicion at one stroke. If you or I or any normally made man in the\ncountry were accused of this crime, we should be acquitted as an infant\nwould be acquitted of stealing the Nelson column.”\n\n“That’s what I say,” repeated the cobbler obstinately; “there’s only one\nman that could have done it, and he’s the man that would have done it.\nWhere’s Simeon Barnes, the blacksmith?”\n\n“He’s over at Greenford,” faltered the curate.\n\n“More likely over in France,” muttered the cobbler.\n\n“No; he is in neither of those places,” said a small and colourless\nvoice, which came from the little Roman priest who had joined the group.\n“As a matter of fact, he is coming up the road at this moment.”\n\nThe little priest was not an interesting man to look at, having stubbly\nbrown hair and a round and stolid face. But if he had been as splendid\nas Apollo no one would have looked at him at that moment. Everyone\nturned round and peered at the pathway which wound across the plain\nbelow, along which was indeed walking, at his own huge stride and with\na hammer on his shoulder, Simeon the smith. He was a bony and gigantic\nman, with deep, dark, sinister eyes and a dark chin beard. He was\nwalking and talking quietly with two other men; and though he was never\nspecially cheerful, he seemed quite at his ease.\n\n“My God!” cried the atheistic cobbler, “and there’s the hammer he did it\nwith.”\n\n“No,” said the inspector, a sensible-looking man with a sandy moustache,\nspeaking for the first time. “There’s the hammer he did it with over\nthere by the church wall. We have left it and the body exactly as they\nare.”\n\nAll glanced round and the short priest went across and looked down in\nsilence at the tool where it lay. It was one of the smallest and the\nlightest of the hammers, and would not have caught the eye among the\nrest; but on the iron edge of it were blood and yellow hair.\n\nAfter a silence the short priest spoke without looking up, and there was\na new note in his dull voice. “Mr. Gibbs was hardly right,” he said, “in\nsaying that there is no mystery. There is at least the mystery of why so\nbig a man should attempt so big a blow with so little a hammer.”\n\n“Oh, never mind that,” cried Gibbs, in a fever. “What are we to do with\nSimeon Barnes?”\n\n“Leave him alone,” said the priest quietly. “He is coming here of\nhimself. I know those two men with him. They are very good fellows from\nGreenford, and they have come over about the Presbyterian chapel.”\n\nEven as he spoke the tall smith swung round the corner of the church,\nand strode into his own yard. Then he stood there quite still, and the\nhammer fell from his hand. The inspector, who had preserved impenetrable\npropriety, immediately went up to him.\n\n“I won’t ask you, Mr. Barnes,” he said, “whether you know anything about\nwhat has happened here. You are not bound to say. I hope you don’t know,\nand that you will be able to prove it. But I must go through the form\nof arresting you in the King’s name for the murder of Colonel Norman\nBohun.”\n\n“You are not bound to say anything,” said the cobbler in officious\nexcitement. “They’ve got to prove everything. They haven’t proved yet\nthat it is Colonel Bohun, with the head all smashed up like that.”\n\n“That won’t wash,” said the doctor aside to the priest. “That’s out of\nthe detective stories. I was the colonel’s medical man, and I knew his\nbody better than he did. He had very fine hands, but quite peculiar\nones. The second and third fingers were the same length. Oh, that’s the\ncolonel right enough.”\n\nAs he glanced at the brained corpse upon the ground the iron eyes of the\nmotionless blacksmith followed them and rested there also.\n\n“Is Colonel Bohun dead?” said the smith quite calmly. “Then he’s\ndamned.”\n\n“Don’t say anything! Oh, don’t say anything,” cried the atheist cobbler,\ndancing about in an ecstasy of admiration of the English legal system.\nFor no man is such a legalist as the good Secularist.\n\nThe blacksmith turned on him over his shoulder the august face of a\nfanatic.\n\n“It’s well for you infidels to dodge like foxes because the world’s law\nfavours you,” he said; “but God guards His own in His pocket, as you\nshall see this day.”\n\nThen he pointed to the colonel and said: “When did this dog die in his\nsins?”\n\n“Moderate your language,” said the doctor.\n\n“Moderate the Bible’s language, and I’ll moderate mine. When did he\ndie?”\n\n“I saw him alive at six o’clock this morning,” stammered Wilfred Bohun.\n\n“God is good,” said the smith. “Mr. Inspector, I have not the slightest\nobjection to being arrested. It is you who may object to arresting me.\nI don’t mind leaving the court without a stain on my character. You do\nmind perhaps leaving the court with a bad set-back in your career.”\n\nThe solid inspector for the first time looked at the blacksmith with a\nlively eye; as did everybody else, except the short, strange priest, who\nwas still looking down at the little hammer that had dealt the dreadful\nblow.\n\n“There are two men standing outside this shop,” went on the blacksmith\nwith ponderous lucidity, “good tradesmen in Greenford whom you all know,\nwho will swear that they saw me from before midnight till daybreak and\nlong after in the committee room of our Revival Mission, which sits all\nnight, we save souls so fast. In Greenford itself twenty people could\nswear to me for all that time. If I were a heathen, Mr. Inspector, I\nwould let you walk on to your downfall. But as a Christian man I feel\nbound to give you your chance, and ask you whether you will hear my\nalibi now or in court.”\n\nThe inspector seemed for the first time disturbed, and said, “Of course\nI should be glad to clear you altogether now.”\n\nThe smith walked out of his yard with the same long and easy stride, and\nreturned to his two friends from Greenford, who were indeed friends of\nnearly everyone present. Each of them said a few words which no one ever\nthought of disbelieving. When they had spoken, the innocence of Simeon\nstood up as solid as the great church above them.\n\nOne of those silences struck the group which are more strange and\ninsufferable than any speech. Madly, in order to make conversation, the\ncurate said to the Catholic priest:\n\n“You seem very much interested in that hammer, Father Brown.”\n\n“Yes, I am,” said Father Brown; “why is it such a small hammer?”\n\nThe doctor swung round on him.\n\n“By George, that’s true,” he cried; “who would use a little hammer with\nten larger hammers lying about?”\n\nThen he lowered his voice in the curate’s ear and said: “Only the kind\nof person that can’t lift a large hammer. It is not a question of force\nor courage between the sexes. It’s a question of lifting power in the\nshoulders. A bold woman could commit ten murders with a light hammer and\nnever turn a hair. She could not kill a beetle with a heavy one.”\n\nWilfred Bohun was staring at him with a sort of hypnotised horror,\nwhile Father Brown listened with his head a little on one side, really\ninterested and attentive. The doctor went on with more hissing emphasis:\n\n“Why do these idiots always assume that the only person who hates the\nwife’s lover is the wife’s husband? Nine times out of ten the person\nwho most hates the wife’s lover is the wife. Who knows what insolence or\ntreachery he had shown her--look there!”\n\nHe made a momentary gesture towards the red-haired woman on the bench.\nShe had lifted her head at last and the tears were drying on her\nsplendid face. But the eyes were fixed on the corpse with an electric\nglare that had in it something of idiocy.\n\nThe Rev. Wilfred Bohun made a limp gesture as if waving away all desire\nto know; but Father Brown, dusting off his sleeve some ashes blown from\nthe furnace, spoke in his indifferent way.\n\n“You are like so many doctors,” he said; “your mental science is really\nsuggestive. It is your physical science that is utterly impossible. I\nagree that the woman wants to kill the co-respondent much more than the\npetitioner does. And I agree that a woman will always pick up a small\nhammer instead of a big one. But the difficulty is one of physical\nimpossibility. No woman ever born could have smashed a man’s skull\nout flat like that.” Then he added reflectively, after a pause: “These\npeople haven’t grasped the whole of it. The man was actually wearing an\niron helmet, and the blow scattered it like broken glass. Look at that\nwoman. Look at her arms.”\n\nSilence held them all up again, and then the doctor said rather sulkily:\n“Well, I may be wrong; there are objections to everything. But I stick\nto the main point. No man but an idiot would pick up that little hammer\nif he could use a big hammer.”\n\nWith that the lean and quivering hands of Wilfred Bohun went up to his\nhead and seemed to clutch his scanty yellow hair. After an instant they\ndropped, and he cried: “That was the word I wanted; you have said the\nword.”\n\nThen he continued, mastering his discomposure: “The words you said were,\n‘No man but an idiot would pick up the small hammer.’”\n\n“Yes,” said the doctor. “Well?”\n\n“Well,” said the curate, “no man but an idiot did.” The rest stared\nat him with eyes arrested and riveted, and he went on in a febrile and\nfeminine agitation.\n\n“I am a priest,” he cried unsteadily, “and a priest should be no shedder\nof blood. I--I mean that he should bring no one to the gallows. And I\nthank God that I see the criminal clearly now--because he is a criminal\nwho cannot be brought to the gallows.”\n\n“You will not denounce him?” inquired the doctor.\n\n“He would not be hanged if I did denounce him,” answered Wilfred with\na wild but curiously happy smile. “When I went into the church this\nmorning I found a madman praying there--that poor Joe, who has been\nwrong all his life. God knows what he prayed; but with such strange folk\nit is not incredible to suppose that their prayers are all upside down.\nVery likely a lunatic would pray before killing a man. When I last saw\npoor Joe he was with my brother. My brother was mocking him.”\n\n“By Jove!” cried the doctor, “this is talking at last. But how do you\nexplain--”\n\nThe Rev. Wilfred was almost trembling with the excitement of his\nown glimpse of the truth. “Don’t you see; don’t you see,” he cried\nfeverishly; “that is the only theory that covers both the queer things,\nthat answers both the riddles. The two riddles are the little hammer and\nthe big blow. The smith might have struck the big blow, but would not\nhave chosen the little hammer. His wife would have chosen the little\nhammer, but she could not have struck the big blow. But the madman might\nhave done both. As for the little hammer--why, he was mad and might have\npicked up anything. And for the big blow, have you never heard, doctor,\nthat a maniac in his paroxysm may have the strength of ten men?”\n\nThe doctor drew a deep breath and then said, “By golly, I believe you’ve\ngot it.”\n\nFather Brown had fixed his eyes on the speaker so long and steadily\nas to prove that his large grey, ox-like eyes were not quite so\ninsignificant as the rest of his face. When silence had fallen he said\nwith marked respect: “Mr. Bohun, yours is the only theory yet propounded\nwhich holds water every way and is essentially unassailable. I think,\ntherefore, that you deserve to be told, on my positive knowledge, that\nit is not the true one.” And with that the old little man walked away\nand stared again at the hammer.\n\n“That fellow seems to know more than he ought to,” whispered the doctor\npeevishly to Wilfred. “Those popish priests are deucedly sly.”\n\n“No, no,” said Bohun, with a sort of wild fatigue. “It was the lunatic.\nIt was the lunatic.”\n\nThe group of the two clerics and the doctor had fallen away from\nthe more official group containing the inspector and the man he had\narrested. Now, however, that their own party had broken up, they heard\nvoices from the others. The priest looked up quietly and then looked\ndown again as he heard the blacksmith say in a loud voice:\n\n“I hope I’ve convinced you, Mr. Inspector. I’m a strong man, as you say,\nbut I couldn’t have flung my hammer bang here from Greenford. My hammer\nhasn’t got wings that it should come flying half a mile over hedges and\nfields.”\n\nThe inspector laughed amicably and said: “No, I think you can be\nconsidered out of it, though it’s one of the rummiest coincidences I\never saw. I can only ask you to give us all the assistance you can in\nfinding a man as big and strong as yourself. By George! you might be\nuseful, if only to hold him! I suppose you yourself have no guess at the\nman?”\n\n“I may have a guess,” said the pale smith, “but it is not at a man.”\n Then, seeing the scared eyes turn towards his wife on the bench, he put\nhis huge hand on her shoulder and said: “Nor a woman either.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the inspector jocularly. “You don’t think cows\nuse hammers, do you?”\n\n“I think no thing of flesh held that hammer,” said the blacksmith in a\nstifled voice; “mortally speaking, I think the man died alone.”\n\nWilfred made a sudden forward movement and peered at him with burning\neyes.\n\n“Do you mean to say, Barnes,” came the sharp voice of the cobbler, “that\nthe hammer jumped up of itself and knocked the man down?”\n\n“Oh, you gentlemen may stare and snigger,” cried Simeon; “you clergymen\nwho tell us on Sunday in what a stillness the Lord smote Sennacherib. I\nbelieve that One who walks invisible in every house defended the honour\nof mine, and laid the defiler dead before the door of it. I believe the\nforce in that blow was just the force there is in earthquakes, and no\nforce less.”\n\nWilfred said, with a voice utterly undescribable: “I told Norman myself\nto beware of the thunderbolt.”\n\n“That agent is outside my jurisdiction,” said the inspector with a\nslight smile.\n\n“You are not outside His,” answered the smith; “see you to it,” and,\nturning his broad back, he went into the house.\n\nThe shaken Wilfred was led away by Father Brown, who had an easy and\nfriendly way with him. “Let us get out of this horrid place, Mr. Bohun,”\n he said. “May I look inside your church? I hear it’s one of the oldest\nin England. We take some interest, you know,” he added with a comical\ngrimace, “in old English churches.”\n\nWilfred Bohun did not smile, for humour was never his strong point. But\nhe nodded rather eagerly, being only too ready to explain the\nGothic splendours to someone more likely to be sympathetic than the\nPresbyterian blacksmith or the atheist cobbler.\n\n“By all means,” he said; “let us go in at this side.” And he led the way\ninto the high side entrance at the top of the flight of steps. Father\nBrown was mounting the first step to follow him when he felt a hand on\nhis shoulder, and turned to behold the dark, thin figure of the doctor,\nhis face darker yet with suspicion.\n\n“Sir,” said the physician harshly, “you appear to know some secrets\nin this black business. May I ask if you are going to keep them to\nyourself?”\n\n“Why, doctor,” answered the priest, smiling quite pleasantly, “there is\none very good reason why a man of my trade should keep things to himself\nwhen he is not sure of them, and that is that it is so constantly his\nduty to keep them to himself when he is sure of them. But if you think\nI have been discourteously reticent with you or anyone, I will go to the\nextreme limit of my custom. I will give you two very large hints.”\n\n“Well, sir?” said the doctor gloomily.\n\n“First,” said Father Brown quietly, “the thing is quite in your\nown province. It is a matter of physical science. The blacksmith is\nmistaken, not perhaps in saying that the blow was divine, but certainly\nin saying that it came by a miracle. It was no miracle, doctor, except\nin so far as man is himself a miracle, with his strange and wicked and\nyet half-heroic heart. The force that smashed that skull was a force\nwell known to scientists--one of the most frequently debated of the laws\nof nature.”\n\nThe doctor, who was looking at him with frowning intentness, only said:\n“And the other hint?”\n\n“The other hint is this,” said the priest. “Do you remember the\nblacksmith, though he believes in miracles, talking scornfully of the\nimpossible fairy tale that his hammer had wings and flew half a mile\nacross country?”\n\n“Yes,” said the doctor, “I remember that.”\n\n“Well,” added Father Brown, with a broad smile, “that fairy tale was the\nnearest thing to the real truth that has been said today.” And with that\nhe turned his back and stumped up the steps after the curate.\n\nThe Reverend Wilfred, who had been waiting for him, pale and impatient,\nas if this little delay were the last straw for his nerves, led him\nimmediately to his favourite corner of the church, that part of the\ngallery closest to the carved roof and lit by the wonderful window\nwith the angel. The little Latin priest explored and admired everything\nexhaustively, talking cheerfully but in a low voice all the time.\nWhen in the course of his investigation he found the side exit and the\nwinding stair down which Wilfred had rushed to find his brother dead,\nFather Brown ran not down but up, with the agility of a monkey, and his\nclear voice came from an outer platform above.\n\n“Come up here, Mr. Bohun,” he called. “The air will do you good.”\n\nBohun followed him, and came out on a kind of stone gallery or balcony\noutside the building, from which one could see the illimitable plain\nin which their small hill stood, wooded away to the purple horizon\nand dotted with villages and farms. Clear and square, but quite small\nbeneath them, was the blacksmith’s yard, where the inspector still stood\ntaking notes and the corpse still lay like a smashed fly.\n\n“Might be the map of the world, mightn’t it?” said Father Brown.\n\n“Yes,” said Bohun very gravely, and nodded his head.\n\nImmediately beneath and about them the lines of the Gothic building\nplunged outwards into the void with a sickening swiftness akin to\nsuicide. There is that element of Titan energy in the architecture of\nthe Middle Ages that, from whatever aspect it be seen, it always seems\nto be rushing away, like the strong back of some maddened horse. This\nchurch was hewn out of ancient and silent stone, bearded with old\nfungoids and stained with the nests of birds. And yet, when they saw it\nfrom below, it sprang like a fountain at the stars; and when they saw\nit, as now, from above, it poured like a cataract into a voiceless pit.\nFor these two men on the tower were left alone with the most terrible\naspect of Gothic; the monstrous foreshortening and disproportion, the\ndizzy perspectives, the glimpses of great things small and small things\ngreat; a topsy-turvydom of stone in the mid-air. Details of stone,\nenormous by their proximity, were relieved against a pattern of fields\nand farms, pygmy in their distance. A carved bird or beast at a corner\nseemed like some vast walking or flying dragon wasting the pastures and\nvillages below. The whole atmosphere was dizzy and dangerous, as if men\nwere upheld in air amid the gyrating wings of colossal genii; and the\nwhole of that old church, as tall and rich as a cathedral, seemed to sit\nupon the sunlit country like a cloudburst.\n\n“I think there is something rather dangerous about standing on these\nhigh places even to pray,” said Father Brown. “Heights were made to be\nlooked at, not to be looked from.”\n\n“Do you mean that one may fall over,” asked Wilfred.\n\n“I mean that one’s soul may fall if one’s body doesn’t,” said the other\npriest.\n\n“I scarcely understand you,” remarked Bohun indistinctly.\n\n“Look at that blacksmith, for instance,” went on Father Brown calmly; “a\ngood man, but not a Christian--hard, imperious, unforgiving. Well, his\nScotch religion was made up by men who prayed on hills and high crags,\nand learnt to look down on the world more than to look up at heaven.\nHumility is the mother of giants. One sees great things from the valley;\nonly small things from the peak.”\n\n“But he--he didn’t do it,” said Bohun tremulously.\n\n“No,” said the other in an odd voice; “we know he didn’t do it.”\n\nAfter a moment he resumed, looking tranquilly out over the plain with\nhis pale grey eyes. “I knew a man,” he said, “who began by worshipping\nwith others before the altar, but who grew fond of high and lonely\nplaces to pray from, corners or niches in the belfry or the spire. And\nonce in one of those dizzy places, where the whole world seemed to turn\nunder him like a wheel, his brain turned also, and he fancied he was\nGod. So that, though he was a good man, he committed a great crime.”\n\nWilfred’s face was turned away, but his bony hands turned blue and white\nas they tightened on the parapet of stone.\n\n“He thought it was given to him to judge the world and strike down the\nsinner. He would never have had such a thought if he had been kneeling\nwith other men upon a floor. But he saw all men walking about like\ninsects. He saw one especially strutting just below him, insolent and\nevident by a bright green hat--a poisonous insect.”\n\nRooks cawed round the corners of the belfry; but there was no other\nsound till Father Brown went on.\n\n“This also tempted him, that he had in his hand one of the most awful\nengines of nature; I mean gravitation, that mad and quickening rush by\nwhich all earth’s creatures fly back to her heart when released. See,\nthe inspector is strutting just below us in the smithy. If I were to\ntoss a pebble over this parapet it would be something like a bullet\nby the time it struck him. If I were to drop a hammer--even a small\nhammer--”\n\nWilfred Bohun threw one leg over the parapet, and Father Brown had him\nin a minute by the collar.\n\n“Not by that door,” he said quite gently; “that door leads to hell.”\n\nBohun staggered back against the wall, and stared at him with frightful\neyes.\n\n“How do you know all this?” he cried. “Are you a devil?”\n\n“I am a man,” answered Father Brown gravely; “and therefore have all\ndevils in my heart. Listen to me,” he said after a short pause. “I know\nwhat you did--at least, I can guess the great part of it. When you left\nyour brother you were racked with no unrighteous rage, to the extent\neven that you snatched up a small hammer, half inclined to kill him with\nhis foulness on his mouth. Recoiling, you thrust it under your buttoned\ncoat instead, and rushed into the church. You pray wildly in many\nplaces, under the angel window, upon the platform above, and a higher\nplatform still, from which you could see the colonel’s Eastern hat like\nthe back of a green beetle crawling about. Then something snapped in\nyour soul, and you let God’s thunderbolt fall.”\n\nWilfred put a weak hand to his head, and asked in a low voice: “How did\nyou know that his hat looked like a green beetle?”\n\n“Oh, that,” said the other with the shadow of a smile, “that was common\nsense. But hear me further. I say I know all this; but no one else shall\nknow it. The next step is for you; I shall take no more steps; I will\nseal this with the seal of confession. If you ask me why, there are many\nreasons, and only one that concerns you. I leave things to you because\nyou have not yet gone very far wrong, as assassins go. You did not help\nto fix the crime on the smith when it was easy; or on his wife, when\nthat was easy. You tried to fix it on the imbecile because you knew that\nhe could not suffer. That was one of the gleams that it is my business\nto find in assassins. And now come down into the village, and go your\nown way as free as the wind; for I have said my last word.”\n\nThey went down the winding stairs in utter silence, and came out into\nthe sunlight by the smithy. Wilfred Bohun carefully unlatched the wooden\ngate of the yard, and going up to the inspector, said: “I wish to give\nmyself up; I have killed my brother.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Eye of Apollo\n\n\nThat singular smoky sparkle, at once a confusion and a transparency,\nwhich is the strange secret of the Thames, was changing more and more\nfrom its grey to its glittering extreme as the sun climbed to the zenith\nover Westminster, and two men crossed Westminster Bridge. One man\nwas very tall and the other very short; they might even have been\nfantastically compared to the arrogant clock-tower of Parliament and the\nhumbler humped shoulders of the Abbey, for the short man was in clerical\ndress. The official description of the tall man was M. Hercule Flambeau,\nprivate detective, and he was going to his new offices in a new pile of\nflats facing the Abbey entrance. The official description of the short\nman was the Reverend J. Brown, attached to St. Francis Xavier’s Church,\nCamberwell, and he was coming from a Camberwell deathbed to see the new\noffices of his friend.\n\nThe building was American in its sky-scraping altitude, and American\nalso in the oiled elaboration of its machinery of telephones and lifts.\nBut it was barely finished and still understaffed; only three tenants\nhad moved in; the office just above Flambeau was occupied, as also\nwas the office just below him; the two floors above that and the three\nfloors below were entirely bare. But the first glance at the new tower\nof flats caught something much more arresting. Save for a few relics of\nscaffolding, the one glaring object was erected outside the office\njust above Flambeau’s. It was an enormous gilt effigy of the human eye,\nsurrounded with rays of gold, and taking up as much room as two or three\nof the office windows.\n\n“What on earth is that?” asked Father Brown, and stood still. “Oh, a\nnew religion,” said Flambeau, laughing; “one of those new religions that\nforgive your sins by saying you never had any. Rather like Christian\nScience, I should think. The fact is that a fellow calling himself Kalon\n(I don’t know what his name is, except that it can’t be that) has taken\nthe flat just above me. I have two lady typewriters underneath me, and\nthis enthusiastic old humbug on top. He calls himself the New Priest of\nApollo, and he worships the sun.”\n\n“Let him look out,” said Father Brown. “The sun was the cruellest of all\nthe gods. But what does that monstrous eye mean?”\n\n“As I understand it, it is a theory of theirs,” answered Flambeau, “that\na man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady. Their two great\nsymbols are the sun and the open eye; for they say that if a man were\nreally healthy he could stare at the sun.”\n\n“If a man were really healthy,” said Father Brown, “he would not bother\nto stare at it.”\n\n“Well, that’s all I can tell you about the new religion,” went on\nFlambeau carelessly. “It claims, of course, that it can cure all\nphysical diseases.”\n\n“Can it cure the one spiritual disease?” asked Father Brown, with a\nserious curiosity.\n\n“And what is the one spiritual disease?” asked Flambeau, smiling.\n\n“Oh, thinking one is quite well,” said his friend.\n\nFlambeau was more interested in the quiet little office below him than\nin the flamboyant temple above. He was a lucid Southerner, incapable\nof conceiving himself as anything but a Catholic or an atheist; and new\nreligions of a bright and pallid sort were not much in his line. But\nhumanity was always in his line, especially when it was good-looking;\nmoreover, the ladies downstairs were characters in their way. The office\nwas kept by two sisters, both slight and dark, one of them tall and\nstriking. She had a dark, eager and aquiline profile, and was one of\nthose women whom one always thinks of in profile, as of the clean-cut\nedge of some weapon. She seemed to cleave her way through life. She had\neyes of startling brilliancy, but it was the brilliancy of steel rather\nthan of diamonds; and her straight, slim figure was a shade too stiff\nfor its grace. Her younger sister was like her shortened shadow,\na little greyer, paler, and more insignificant. They both wore a\nbusiness-like black, with little masculine cuffs and collars. There are\nthousands of such curt, strenuous ladies in the offices of London,\nbut the interest of these lay rather in their real than their apparent\nposition.\n\nFor Pauline Stacey, the elder, was actually the heiress of a crest\nand half a county, as well as great wealth; she had been brought up in\ncastles and gardens, before a frigid fierceness (peculiar to the modern\nwoman) had driven her to what she considered a harsher and a higher\nexistence. She had not, indeed, surrendered her money; in that there\nwould have been a romantic or monkish abandon quite alien to her\nmasterful utilitarianism. She held her wealth, she would say, for use\nupon practical social objects. Part of it she had put into her business,\nthe nucleus of a model typewriting emporium; part of it was distributed\nin various leagues and causes for the advancement of such work among\nwomen. How far Joan, her sister and partner, shared this slightly\nprosaic idealism no one could be very sure. But she followed her leader\nwith a dog-like affection which was somehow more attractive, with its\ntouch of tragedy, than the hard, high spirits of the elder. For Pauline\nStacey had nothing to say to tragedy; she was understood to deny its\nexistence.\n\nHer rigid rapidity and cold impatience had amused Flambeau very much on\nthe first occasion of his entering the flats. He had lingered outside\nthe lift in the entrance hall waiting for the lift-boy, who generally\nconducts strangers to the various floors. But this bright-eyed falcon\nof a girl had openly refused to endure such official delay. She said\nsharply that she knew all about the lift, and was not dependent on\nboys--or men either. Though her flat was only three floors above, she\nmanaged in the few seconds of ascent to give Flambeau a great many of\nher fundamental views in an off-hand manner; they were to the general\neffect that she was a modern working woman and loved modern working\nmachinery. Her bright black eyes blazed with abstract anger against\nthose who rebuke mechanic science and ask for the return of romance.\nEveryone, she said, ought to be able to manage machines, just as she\ncould manage the lift. She seemed almost to resent the fact of Flambeau\nopening the lift-door for her; and that gentleman went up to his own\napartments smiling with somewhat mingled feelings at the memory of such\nspit-fire self-dependence.\n\nShe certainly had a temper, of a snappy, practical sort; the gestures of\nher thin, elegant hands were abrupt or even destructive.\n\nOnce Flambeau entered her office on some typewriting business, and found\nshe had just flung a pair of spectacles belonging to her sister into the\nmiddle of the floor and stamped on them. She was already in the rapids\nof an ethical tirade about the “sickly medical notions” and the morbid\nadmission of weakness implied in such an apparatus. She dared her sister\nto bring such artificial, unhealthy rubbish into the place again. She\nasked if she was expected to wear wooden legs or false hair or glass\neyes; and as she spoke her eyes sparkled like the terrible crystal.\n\nFlambeau, quite bewildered with this fanaticism, could not refrain from\nasking Miss Pauline (with direct French logic) why a pair of spectacles\nwas a more morbid sign of weakness than a lift, and why, if science\nmight help us in the one effort, it might not help us in the other.\n\n“That is so different,” said Pauline Stacey, loftily. “Batteries and\nmotors and all those things are marks of the force of man--yes, Mr.\nFlambeau, and the force of woman, too! We shall take our turn at these\ngreat engines that devour distance and defy time. That is high and\nsplendid--that is really science. But these nasty props and plasters the\ndoctors sell--why, they are just badges of poltroonery. Doctors stick\non legs and arms as if we were born cripples and sick slaves. But I\nwas free-born, Mr. Flambeau! People only think they need these things\nbecause they have been trained in fear instead of being trained in power\nand courage, just as the silly nurses tell children not to stare at the\nsun, and so they can’t do it without blinking. But why among the stars\nshould there be one star I may not see? The sun is not my master, and I\nwill open my eyes and stare at him whenever I choose.”\n\n“Your eyes,” said Flambeau, with a foreign bow, “will dazzle the sun.”\n He took pleasure in complimenting this strange stiff beauty, partly\nbecause it threw her a little off her balance. But as he went upstairs\nto his floor he drew a deep breath and whistled, saying to himself: “So\nshe has got into the hands of that conjurer upstairs with his golden\neye.” For, little as he knew or cared about the new religion of Kalon,\nhe had heard of his special notion about sun-gazing.\n\nHe soon discovered that the spiritual bond between the floors above and\nbelow him was close and increasing. The man who called himself Kalon was\na magnificent creature, worthy, in a physical sense, to be the pontiff\nof Apollo. He was nearly as tall even as Flambeau, and very much better\nlooking, with a golden beard, strong blue eyes, and a mane flung back\nlike a lion’s. In structure he was the blonde beast of Nietzsche,\nbut all this animal beauty was heightened, brightened and softened by\ngenuine intellect and spirituality. If he looked like one of the great\nSaxon kings, he looked like one of the kings that were also saints. And\nthis despite the cockney incongruity of his surroundings; the fact that\nhe had an office half-way up a building in Victoria Street; that the\nclerk (a commonplace youth in cuffs and collars) sat in the outer room,\nbetween him and the corridor; that his name was on a brass plate,\nand the gilt emblem of his creed hung above his street, like the\nadvertisement of an oculist. All this vulgarity could not take away from\nthe man called Kalon the vivid oppression and inspiration that came\nfrom his soul and body. When all was said, a man in the presence of\nthis quack did feel in the presence of a great man. Even in the loose\njacket-suit of linen that he wore as a workshop dress in his office he\nwas a fascinating and formidable figure; and when robed in the white\nvestments and crowned with the golden circlet, in which he daily saluted\nthe sun, he really looked so splendid that the laughter of the street\npeople sometimes died suddenly on their lips. For three times in the day\nthe new sun-worshipper went out on his little balcony, in the face\nof all Westminster, to say some litany to his shining lord: once at\ndaybreak, once at sunset, and once at the shock of noon. And it\nwas while the shock of noon still shook faintly from the towers of\nParliament and parish church that Father Brown, the friend of Flambeau,\nfirst looked up and saw the white priest of Apollo.\n\nFlambeau had seen quite enough of these daily salutations of Phoebus,\nand plunged into the porch of the tall building without even looking\nfor his clerical friend to follow. But Father Brown, whether from a\nprofessional interest in ritual or a strong individual interest in\ntomfoolery, stopped and stared up at the balcony of the sun-worshipper,\njust as he might have stopped and stared up at a Punch and Judy. Kalon\nthe Prophet was already erect, with argent garments and uplifted hands,\nand the sound of his strangely penetrating voice could be heard all the\nway down the busy street uttering his solar litany. He was already\nin the middle of it; his eyes were fixed upon the flaming disc. It is\ndoubtful if he saw anything or anyone on this earth; it is substantially\ncertain that he did not see a stunted, round-faced priest who, in the\ncrowd below, looked up at him with blinking eyes. That was perhaps the\nmost startling difference between even these two far divided men. Father\nBrown could not look at anything without blinking; but the priest of\nApollo could look on the blaze at noon without a quiver of the eyelid.\n\n“O sun,” cried the prophet, “O star that art too great to be allowed\namong the stars! O fountain that flowest quietly in that secret spot\nthat is called space. White Father of all white unwearied things, white\nflames and white flowers and white peaks. Father, who art more innocent\nthan all thy most innocent and quiet children; primal purity, into the\npeace of which--”\n\nA rush and crash like the reversed rush of a rocket was cloven with a\nstrident and incessant yelling. Five people rushed into the gate of\nthe mansions as three people rushed out, and for an instant they all\ndeafened each other. The sense of some utterly abrupt horror seemed for\na moment to fill half the street with bad news--bad news that was all\nthe worse because no one knew what it was. Two figures remained still\nafter the crash of commotion: the fair priest of Apollo on the balcony\nabove, and the ugly priest of Christ below him.\n\nAt last the tall figure and titanic energy of Flambeau appeared in the\ndoorway of the mansions and dominated the little mob. Talking at the top\nof his voice like a fog-horn, he told somebody or anybody to go for a\nsurgeon; and as he turned back into the dark and thronged entrance his\nfriend Father Brown dipped in insignificantly after him. Even as he\nducked and dived through the crowd he could still hear the magnificent\nmelody and monotony of the solar priest still calling on the happy god\nwho is the friend of fountains and flowers.\n\nFather Brown found Flambeau and some six other people standing round the\nenclosed space into which the lift commonly descended. But the lift had\nnot descended. Something else had descended; something that ought to\nhave come by a lift.\n\nFor the last four minutes Flambeau had looked down on it; had seen\nthe brained and bleeding figure of that beautiful woman who denied the\nexistence of tragedy. He had never had the slightest doubt that it was\nPauline Stacey; and, though he had sent for a doctor, he had not the\nslightest doubt that she was dead.\n\nHe could not remember for certain whether he had liked her or disliked\nher; there was so much both to like and dislike. But she had been a\nperson to him, and the unbearable pathos of details and habit stabbed\nhim with all the small daggers of bereavement. He remembered her pretty\nface and priggish speeches with a sudden secret vividness which is all\nthe bitterness of death. In an instant like a bolt from the blue, like\na thunderbolt from nowhere, that beautiful and defiant body had been\ndashed down the open well of the lift to death at the bottom. Was it\nsuicide? With so insolent an optimist it seemed impossible. Was it\nmurder? But who was there in those hardly inhabited flats to murder\nanybody? In a rush of raucous words, which he meant to be strong and\nsuddenly found weak, he asked where was that fellow Kalon. A voice,\nhabitually heavy, quiet and full, assured him that Kalon for the last\nfifteen minutes had been away up on his balcony worshipping his god.\nWhen Flambeau heard the voice, and felt the hand of Father Brown, he\nturned his swarthy face and said abruptly:\n\n“Then, if he has been up there all the time, who can have done it?”\n\n“Perhaps,” said the other, “we might go upstairs and find out. We have\nhalf an hour before the police will move.”\n\nLeaving the body of the slain heiress in charge of the surgeons,\nFlambeau dashed up the stairs to the typewriting office, found it\nutterly empty, and then dashed up to his own. Having entered that, he\nabruptly returned with a new and white face to his friend.\n\n“Her sister,” he said, with an unpleasant seriousness, “her sister seems\nto have gone out for a walk.”\n\nFather Brown nodded. “Or, she may have gone up to the office of that sun\nman,” he said. “If I were you I should just verify that, and then let\nus all talk it over in your office. No,” he added suddenly, as if\nremembering something, “shall I ever get over that stupidity of mine? Of\ncourse, in their office downstairs.”\n\nFlambeau stared; but he followed the little father downstairs to the\nempty flat of the Staceys, where that impenetrable pastor took a large\nred-leather chair in the very entrance, from which he could see the\nstairs and landings, and waited. He did not wait very long. In about\nfour minutes three figures descended the stairs, alike only in\ntheir solemnity. The first was Joan Stacey, the sister of the dead\nwoman--evidently she had been upstairs in the temporary temple of\nApollo; the second was the priest of Apollo himself, his\nlitany finished, sweeping down the empty stairs in utter\nmagnificence--something in his white robes, beard and parted hair had\nthe look of Dore’s Christ leaving the Pretorium; the third was Flambeau,\nblack browed and somewhat bewildered.\n\nMiss Joan Stacey, dark, with a drawn face and hair prematurely touched\nwith grey, walked straight to her own desk and set out her papers with a\npractical flap. The mere action rallied everyone else to sanity. If Miss\nJoan Stacey was a criminal, she was a cool one. Father Brown regarded\nher for some time with an odd little smile, and then, without taking his\neyes off her, addressed himself to somebody else.\n\n“Prophet,” he said, presumably addressing Kalon, “I wish you would tell\nme a lot about your religion.”\n\n“I shall be proud to do it,” said Kalon, inclining his still crowned\nhead, “but I am not sure that I understand.”\n\n“Why, it’s like this,” said Father Brown, in his frankly doubtful way:\n“We are taught that if a man has really bad first principles, that must\nbe partly his fault. But, for all that, we can make some difference\nbetween a man who insults his quite clear conscience and a man with a\nconscience more or less clouded with sophistries. Now, do you really\nthink that murder is wrong at all?”\n\n“Is this an accusation?” asked Kalon very quietly.\n\n“No,” answered Brown, equally gently, “it is the speech for the\ndefence.”\n\nIn the long and startled stillness of the room the prophet of Apollo\nslowly rose; and really it was like the rising of the sun. He filled\nthat room with his light and life in such a manner that a man felt he\ncould as easily have filled Salisbury Plain. His robed form seemed to\nhang the whole room with classic draperies; his epic gesture seemed to\nextend it into grander perspectives, till the little black figure of the\nmodern cleric seemed to be a fault and an intrusion, a round, black blot\nupon some splendour of Hellas.\n\n“We meet at last, Caiaphas,” said the prophet. “Your church and mine are\nthe only realities on this earth. I adore the sun, and you the darkening\nof the sun; you are the priest of the dying and I of the living God.\nYour present work of suspicion and slander is worthy of your coat and\ncreed. All your church is but a black police; you are only spies and\ndetectives seeking to tear from men confessions of guilt, whether by\ntreachery or torture. You would convict men of crime, I would convict\nthem of innocence. You would convince them of sin, I would convince them\nof virtue.\n\n“Reader of the books of evil, one more word before I blow away your\nbaseless nightmares for ever. Not even faintly could you understand\nhow little I care whether you can convict me or no. The things you\ncall disgrace and horrible hanging are to me no more than an ogre in a\nchild’s toy-book to a man once grown up. You said you were offering the\nspeech for the defence. I care so little for the cloudland of this life\nthat I will offer you the speech for the prosecution. There is but one\nthing that can be said against me in this matter, and I will say it\nmyself. The woman that is dead was my love and my bride; not after such\nmanner as your tin chapels call lawful, but by a law purer and sterner\nthan you will ever understand. She and I walked another world from\nyours, and trod palaces of crystal while you were plodding through\ntunnels and corridors of brick. Well, I know that policemen, theological\nand otherwise, always fancy that where there has been love there\nmust soon be hatred; so there you have the first point made for the\nprosecution. But the second point is stronger; I do not grudge it you.\nNot only is it true that Pauline loved me, but it is also true that this\nvery morning, before she died, she wrote at that table a will leaving me\nand my new church half a million. Come, where are the handcuffs? Do you\nsuppose I care what foolish things you do with me? Penal servitude will\nonly be like waiting for her at a wayside station. The gallows will only\nbe going to her in a headlong car.”\n\nHe spoke with the brain-shaking authority of an orator, and Flambeau\nand Joan Stacey stared at him in amazed admiration. Father Brown’s face\nseemed to express nothing but extreme distress; he looked at the ground\nwith one wrinkle of pain across his forehead. The prophet of the sun\nleaned easily against the mantelpiece and resumed:\n\n“In a few words I have put before you the whole case against me--the\nonly possible case against me. In fewer words still I will blow it\nto pieces, so that not a trace of it remains. As to whether I have\ncommitted this crime, the truth is in one sentence: I could not have\ncommitted this crime. Pauline Stacey fell from this floor to the\nground at five minutes past twelve. A hundred people will go into the\nwitness-box and say that I was standing out upon the balcony of my own\nrooms above from just before the stroke of noon to a quarter-past--the\nusual period of my public prayers. My clerk (a respectable youth from\nClapham, with no sort of connection with me) will swear that he sat\nin my outer office all the morning, and that no communication passed\nthrough. He will swear that I arrived a full ten minutes before the\nhour, fifteen minutes before any whisper of the accident, and that I did\nnot leave the office or the balcony all that time. No one ever had so\ncomplete an alibi; I could subpoena half Westminster. I think you had\nbetter put the handcuffs away again. The case is at an end.\n\n“But last of all, that no breath of this idiotic suspicion remain in the\nair, I will tell you all you want to know. I believe I do know how my\nunhappy friend came by her death. You can, if you choose, blame me for\nit, or my faith and philosophy at least; but you certainly cannot\nlock me up. It is well known to all students of the higher truths that\ncertain adepts and illuminati have in history attained the power of\nlevitation--that is, of being self-sustained upon the empty air. It is\nbut a part of that general conquest of matter which is the main element\nin our occult wisdom. Poor Pauline was of an impulsive and ambitious\ntemper. I think, to tell the truth, she thought herself somewhat deeper\nin the mysteries than she was; and she has often said to me, as we went\ndown in the lift together, that if one’s will were strong enough, one\ncould float down as harmlessly as a feather. I solemnly believe that in\nsome ecstasy of noble thoughts she attempted the miracle. Her will, or\nfaith, must have failed her at the crucial instant, and the lower law\nof matter had its horrible revenge. There is the whole story, gentlemen,\nvery sad and, as you think, very presumptuous and wicked, but certainly\nnot criminal or in any way connected with me. In the short-hand of the\npolice-courts, you had better call it suicide. I shall always call\nit heroic failure for the advance of science and the slow scaling of\nheaven.”\n\nIt was the first time Flambeau had ever seen Father Brown vanquished. He\nstill sat looking at the ground, with a painful and corrugated brow, as\nif in shame. It was impossible to avoid the feeling which the prophet’s\nwinged words had fanned, that here was a sullen, professional suspecter\nof men overwhelmed by a prouder and purer spirit of natural liberty and\nhealth. At last he said, blinking as if in bodily distress: “Well, if\nthat is so, sir, you need do no more than take the testamentary paper\nyou spoke of and go. I wonder where the poor lady left it.”\n\n“It will be over there on her desk by the door, I think,” said Kalon,\nwith that massive innocence of manner that seemed to acquit him wholly.\n“She told me specially she would write it this morning, and I actually\nsaw her writing as I went up in the lift to my own room.”\n\n“Was her door open then?” asked the priest, with his eye on the corner\nof the matting.\n\n“Yes,” said Kalon calmly.\n\n“Ah! it has been open ever since,” said the other, and resumed his\nsilent study of the mat.\n\n“There is a paper over here,” said the grim Miss Joan, in a somewhat\nsingular voice. She had passed over to her sister’s desk by the doorway,\nand was holding a sheet of blue foolscap in her hand. There was a sour\nsmile on her face that seemed unfit for such a scene or occasion, and\nFlambeau looked at her with a darkening brow.\n\nKalon the prophet stood away from the paper with that loyal\nunconsciousness that had carried him through. But Flambeau took it\nout of the lady’s hand, and read it with the utmost amazement. It did,\nindeed, begin in the formal manner of a will, but after the words “I\ngive and bequeath all of which I die possessed” the writing abruptly\nstopped with a set of scratches, and there was no trace of the name of\nany legatee. Flambeau, in wonder, handed this truncated testament to his\nclerical friend, who glanced at it and silently gave it to the priest of\nthe sun.\n\nAn instant afterwards that pontiff, in his splendid sweeping draperies,\nhad crossed the room in two great strides, and was towering over Joan\nStacey, his blue eyes standing from his head.\n\n“What monkey tricks have you been playing here?” he cried. “That’s not\nall Pauline wrote.”\n\nThey were startled to hear him speak in quite a new voice, with a Yankee\nshrillness in it; all his grandeur and good English had fallen from him\nlike a cloak.\n\n“That is the only thing on her desk,” said Joan, and confronted him\nsteadily with the same smile of evil favour.\n\nOf a sudden the man broke out into blasphemies and cataracts of\nincredulous words. There was something shocking about the dropping of\nhis mask; it was like a man’s real face falling off.\n\n“See here!” he cried in broad American, when he was breathless with\ncursing, “I may be an adventurer, but I guess you’re a murderess. Yes,\ngentlemen, here’s your death explained, and without any levitation. The\npoor girl is writing a will in my favour; her cursed sister comes in,\nstruggles for the pen, drags her to the well, and throws her down before\nshe can finish it. Sakes! I reckon we want the handcuffs after all.”\n\n“As you have truly remarked,” replied Joan, with ugly calm, “your clerk\nis a very respectable young man, who knows the nature of an oath; and\nhe will swear in any court that I was up in your office arranging some\ntypewriting work for five minutes before and five minutes after my\nsister fell. Mr. Flambeau will tell you that he found me there.”\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n“Why, then,” cried Flambeau, “Pauline was alone when she fell, and it\nwas suicide!”\n\n“She was alone when she fell,” said Father Brown, “but it was not\nsuicide.”\n\n“Then how did she die?” asked Flambeau impatiently.\n\n“She was murdered.”\n\n“But she was alone,” objected the detective.\n\n“She was murdered when she was all alone,” answered the priest.\n\nAll the rest stared at him, but he remained sitting in the same\nold dejected attitude, with a wrinkle in his round forehead and an\nappearance of impersonal shame and sorrow; his voice was colourless and\nsad.\n\n“What I want to know,” cried Kalon, with an oath, “is when the police\nare coming for this bloody and wicked sister. She’s killed her flesh and\nblood; she’s robbed me of half a million that was just as sacredly mine\nas--”\n\n“Come, come, prophet,” interrupted Flambeau, with a kind of sneer;\n“remember that all this world is a cloudland.”\n\nThe hierophant of the sun-god made an effort to climb back on his\npedestal. “It is not the mere money,” he cried, “though that would equip\nthe cause throughout the world. It is also my beloved one’s wishes. To\nPauline all this was holy. In Pauline’s eyes--”\n\nFather Brown suddenly sprang erect, so that his chair fell over flat\nbehind him. He was deathly pale, yet he seemed fired with a hope; his\neyes shone.\n\n“That’s it!” he cried in a clear voice. “That’s the way to begin. In\nPauline’s eyes--”\n\nThe tall prophet retreated before the tiny priest in an almost mad\ndisorder. “What do you mean? How dare you?” he cried repeatedly.\n\n“In Pauline’s eyes,” repeated the priest, his own shining more and more.\n“Go on--in God’s name, go on. The foulest crime the fiends ever prompted\nfeels lighter after confession; and I implore you to confess. Go on, go\non--in Pauline’s eyes--”\n\n“Let me go, you devil!” thundered Kalon, struggling like a giant in\nbonds. “Who are you, you cursed spy, to weave your spiders’ webs round\nme, and peep and peer? Let me go.”\n\n“Shall I stop him?” asked Flambeau, bounding towards the exit, for Kalon\nhad already thrown the door wide open.\n\n“No; let him pass,” said Father Brown, with a strange deep sigh that\nseemed to come from the depths of the universe. “Let Cain pass by, for\nhe belongs to God.”\n\nThere was a long-drawn silence in the room when he had left it, which\nwas to Flambeau’s fierce wits one long agony of interrogation. Miss Joan\nStacey very coolly tidied up the papers on her desk.\n\n“Father,” said Flambeau at last, “it is my duty, not my curiosity\nonly--it is my duty to find out, if I can, who committed the crime.”\n\n“Which crime?” asked Father Brown.\n\n“The one we are dealing with, of course,” replied his impatient friend.\n\n“We are dealing with two crimes,” said Brown, “crimes of very different\nweight--and by very different criminals.”\n\nMiss Joan Stacey, having collected and put away her papers, proceeded to\nlock up her drawer. Father Brown went on, noticing her as little as she\nnoticed him.\n\n“The two crimes,” he observed, “were committed against the same weakness\nof the same person, in a struggle for her money. The author of the\nlarger crime found himself thwarted by the smaller crime; the author of\nthe smaller crime got the money.”\n\n“Oh, don’t go on like a lecturer,” groaned Flambeau; “put it in a few\nwords.”\n\n“I can put it in one word,” answered his friend.\n\nMiss Joan Stacey skewered her business-like black hat on to her head\nwith a business-like black frown before a little mirror, and, as the\nconversation proceeded, took her handbag and umbrella in an unhurried\nstyle, and left the room.\n\n“The truth is one word, and a short one,” said Father Brown. “Pauline\nStacey was blind.”\n\n“Blind!” repeated Flambeau, and rose slowly to his whole huge stature.\n\n“She was subject to it by blood,” Brown proceeded. “Her sister would\nhave started eyeglasses if Pauline would have let her; but it was her\nspecial philosophy or fad that one must not encourage such diseases by\nyielding to them. She would not admit the cloud; or she tried to dispel\nit by will. So her eyes got worse and worse with straining; but the\nworst strain was to come. It came with this precious prophet, or\nwhatever he calls himself, who taught her to stare at the hot sun with\nthe naked eye. It was called accepting Apollo. Oh, if these new pagans\nwould only be old pagans, they would be a little wiser! The old pagans\nknew that mere naked Nature-worship must have a cruel side. They knew\nthat the eye of Apollo can blast and blind.”\n\nThere was a pause, and the priest went on in a gentle and even broken\nvoice. “Whether or no that devil deliberately made her blind, there is\nno doubt that he deliberately killed her through her blindness. The very\nsimplicity of the crime is sickening. You know he and she went up and\ndown in those lifts without official help; you know also how smoothly\nand silently the lifts slide. Kalon brought the lift to the girl’s\nlanding, and saw her, through the open door, writing in her slow,\nsightless way the will she had promised him. He called out to her\ncheerily that he had the lift ready for her, and she was to come out\nwhen she was ready. Then he pressed a button and shot soundlessly up to\nhis own floor, walked through his own office, out on to his own balcony,\nand was safely praying before the crowded street when the poor girl,\nhaving finished her work, ran gaily out to where lover and lift were to\nreceive her, and stepped--”\n\n“Don’t!” cried Flambeau.\n\n“He ought to have got half a million by pressing that button,” continued\nthe little father, in the colourless voice in which he talked of such\nhorrors. “But that went smash. It went smash because there happened\nto be another person who also wanted the money, and who also knew the\nsecret about poor Pauline’s sight. There was one thing about that will\nthat I think nobody noticed: although it was unfinished and without\nsignature, the other Miss Stacey and some servant of hers had already\nsigned it as witnesses. Joan had signed first, saying Pauline could\nfinish it later, with a typical feminine contempt for legal forms.\nTherefore, Joan wanted her sister to sign the will without real\nwitnesses. Why? I thought of the blindness, and felt sure she had wanted\nPauline to sign in solitude because she had wanted her not to sign at\nall.\n\n“People like the Staceys always use fountain pens; but this was\nspecially natural to Pauline. By habit and her strong will and memory\nshe could still write almost as well as if she saw; but she could not\ntell when her pen needed dipping. Therefore, her fountain pens were\ncarefully filled by her sister--all except this fountain pen. This was\ncarefully not filled by her sister; the remains of the ink held out\nfor a few lines and then failed altogether. And the prophet lost\nfive hundred thousand pounds and committed one of the most brutal and\nbrilliant murders in human history for nothing.”\n\nFlambeau went to the open door and heard the official police ascending\nthe stairs. He turned and said: “You must have followed everything\ndevilish close to have traced the crime to Kalon in ten minutes.”\n\nFather Brown gave a sort of start.\n\n“Oh! to him,” he said. “No; I had to follow rather close to find out\nabout Miss Joan and the fountain pen. But I knew Kalon was the criminal\nbefore I came into the front door.”\n\n“You must be joking!” cried Flambeau.\n\n“I’m quite serious,” answered the priest. “I tell you I knew he had done\nit, even before I knew what he had done.”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“These pagan stoics,” said Brown reflectively, “always fail by their\nstrength. There came a crash and a scream down the street, and the\npriest of Apollo did not start or look round. I did not know what it\nwas. But I knew that he was expecting it.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Sign of the Broken Sword\n\n\nThe thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers\nsilver. In a sky of dark green-blue-like slate the stars were bleak\nand brilliant like splintered ice. All that thickly wooded and sparsely\ntenanted countryside was stiff with a bitter and brittle frost. The\nblack hollows between the trunks of the trees looked like bottomless,\nblack caverns of that Scandinavian hell, a hell of incalculable cold.\nEven the square stone tower of the church looked northern to the point\nof heathenry, as if it were some barbaric tower among the sea rocks of\nIceland. It was a queer night for anyone to explore a churchyard. But,\non the other hand, perhaps it was worth exploring.\n\nIt rose abruptly out of the ashen wastes of forest in a sort of hump or\nshoulder of green turf that looked grey in the starlight. Most of the\ngraves were on a slant, and the path leading up to the church was\nas steep as a staircase. On the top of the hill, in the one flat and\nprominent place, was the monument for which the place was famous. It\ncontrasted strangely with the featureless graves all round, for it was\nthe work of one of the greatest sculptors of modern Europe; and yet his\nfame was at once forgotten in the fame of the man whose image he had\nmade. It showed, by touches of the small silver pencil of starlight, the\nmassive metal figure of a soldier recumbent, the strong hands sealed\nin an everlasting worship, the great head pillowed upon a gun. The\nvenerable face was bearded, or rather whiskered, in the old, heavy\nColonel Newcome fashion. The uniform, though suggested with the few\nstrokes of simplicity, was that of modern war. By his right side lay a\nsword, of which the tip was broken off; on the left side lay a Bible. On\nglowing summer afternoons wagonettes came full of Americans and cultured\nsuburbans to see the sepulchre; but even then they felt the vast forest\nland with its one dumpy dome of churchyard and church as a place oddly\ndumb and neglected. In this freezing darkness of mid-winter one would\nthink he might be left alone with the stars. Nevertheless, in the\nstillness of those stiff woods a wooden gate creaked, and two dim\nfigures dressed in black climbed up the little path to the tomb.\n\nSo faint was that frigid starlight that nothing could have been\ntraced about them except that while they both wore black, one man was\nenormously big, and the other (perhaps by contrast) almost startlingly\nsmall. They went up to the great graven tomb of the historic warrior,\nand stood for a few minutes staring at it. There was no human, perhaps\nno living, thing for a wide circle; and a morbid fancy might well have\nwondered if they were human themselves. In any case, the beginning of\ntheir conversation might have seemed strange. After the first silence\nthe small man said to the other:\n\n“Where does a wise man hide a pebble?”\n\nAnd the tall man answered in a low voice: “On the beach.”\n\nThe small man nodded, and after a short silence said: “Where does a wise\nman hide a leaf?”\n\nAnd the other answered: “In the forest.”\n\nThere was another stillness, and then the tall man resumed: “Do you mean\nthat when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to\nhide it among sham ones?”\n\n“No, no,” said the little man with a laugh, “we will let bygones be\nbygones.”\n\nHe stamped his cold feet for a second or two, and then said: “I’m\nnot thinking of that at all, but of something else; something rather\npeculiar. Just strike a match, will you?”\n\nThe big man fumbled in his pocket, and soon a scratch and a flare\npainted gold the whole flat side of the monument. On it was cut in black\nletters the well-known words which so many Americans had reverently\nread: “Sacred to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St. Clare, Hero and\nMartyr, who Always Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them, and\nWas Treacherously Slain by Them At Last. May God in Whom he Trusted both\nReward and Revenge him.”\n\nThe match burnt the big man’s fingers, blackened, and dropped. He was\nabout to strike another, but his small companion stopped him. “That’s\nall right, Flambeau, old man; I saw what I wanted. Or, rather, I didn’t\nsee what I didn’t want. And now we must walk a mile and a half along\nthe road to the next inn, and I will try to tell you all about it. For\nHeaven knows a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a\nstory.”\n\nThey descended the precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, and\nset off at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road. They\nhad gone a full quarter of a mile before the smaller man spoke again. He\nsaid: “Yes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach. But what does he\ndo if there is no beach? Do you know anything of that great St. Clare\ntrouble?”\n\n“I know nothing about English generals, Father Brown,” answered the\nlarge man, laughing, “though a little about English policemen. I only\nknow that you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines\nof this fellow, whoever he is. One would think he got buried in\nsix different places. I’ve seen a memorial to General St. Clare in\nWestminster Abbey. I’ve seen a ramping equestrian statue of General\nSt. Clare on the Embankment. I’ve seen a medallion of St. Clare in the\nstreet he was born in, and another in the street he lived in; and now\nyou drag me after dark to his coffin in the village churchyard. I am\nbeginning to be a bit tired of his magnificent personality, especially\nas I don’t in the least know who he was. What are you hunting for in all\nthese crypts and effigies?”\n\n“I am only looking for one word,” said Father Brown. “A word that isn’t\nthere.”\n\n“Well,” asked Flambeau; “are you going to tell me anything about it?”\n\n“I must divide it into two parts,” remarked the priest. “First there is\nwhat everybody knows; and then there is what I know. Now, what everybody\nknows is short and plain enough. It is also entirely wrong.”\n\n“Right you are,” said the big man called Flambeau cheerfully. “Let’s\nbegin at the wrong end. Let’s begin with what everybody knows, which\nisn’t true.”\n\n“If not wholly untrue, it is at least very inadequate,” continued Brown;\n“for in point of fact, all that the public knows amounts precisely to\nthis: The public knows that Arthur St. Clare was a great and successful\nEnglish general. It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns\nboth in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great\nBrazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum. It knows that on that\noccasion St. Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very\nlarge one, and was captured after heroic resistance. And it knows that\nafter his capture, and to the abhorrence of the civilised world, St.\nClare was hanged on the nearest tree. He was found swinging there after\nthe Brazilians had retired, with his broken sword hung round his neck.”\n\n“And that popular story is untrue?” suggested Flambeau.\n\n“No,” said his friend quietly, “that story is quite true, so far as it\ngoes.”\n\n“Well, I think it goes far enough!” said Flambeau; “but if the popular\nstory is true, what is the mystery?”\n\nThey had passed many hundreds of grey and ghostly trees before the\nlittle priest answered. Then he bit his finger reflectively and said:\n“Why, the mystery is a mystery of psychology. Or, rather, it is a\nmystery of two psychologies. In that Brazilian business two of the most\nfamous men of modern history acted flat against their characters. Mind\nyou, Olivier and St. Clare were both heroes--the old thing, and no\nmistake; it was like the fight between Hector and Achilles. Now, what\nwould you say to an affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was\ntreacherous?”\n\n“Go on,” said the large man impatiently as the other bit his finger\nagain.\n\n“Sir Arthur St. Clare was a soldier of the old religious type--the type\nthat saved us during the Mutiny,” continued Brown. “He was always more\nfor duty than for dash; and with all his personal courage was decidedly\na prudent commander, particularly indignant at any needless waste of\nsoldiers. Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a baby\ncould see was absurd. One need not be a strategist to see it was as wild\nas wind; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way\nof a motor-bus. Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the\nEnglish general’s head? The second riddle is, what had become of the\nBrazilian general’s heart? President Olivier might be called a visionary\nor a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to\nthe point of knight errantry. Almost every other prisoner he had ever\ncaptured had been set free or even loaded with benefits. Men who had\nreally wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness.\nWhy the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his\nlife; and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him?\nWell, there you have it. One of the wisest men in the world acted like\nan idiot for no reason. One of the best men in the world acted like a\nfiend for no reason. That’s the long and the short of it; and I leave it\nto you, my boy.”\n\n“No, you don’t,” said the other with a snort. “I leave it to you; and\nyou jolly well tell me all about it.”\n\n“Well,” resumed Father Brown, “it’s not fair to say that the public\nimpression is just what I’ve said, without adding that two things have\nhappened since. I can’t say they threw a new light; for nobody can make\nsense of them. But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the\ndarkness in new directions. The first was this. The family physician\nof the St. Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a\nviolent series of articles, in which he said that the late general was\na religious maniac; but as far as the tale went, this seemed to mean\nlittle more than a religious man.\n\n“Anyhow, the story fizzled out. Everyone knew, of course, that St. Clare\nhad some of the eccentricities of puritan piety. The second incident was\nmuch more arresting. In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made\nthat rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith,\nwho was at that time engaged to St. Clare’s daughter, and who afterwards\nmarried her. He was one of those who were captured by Olivier, and,\nlike all the rest except the general, appears to have been bounteously\ntreated and promptly set free. Some twenty years afterwards this man,\nthen Lieutenant-Colonel Keith, published a sort of autobiography called\n‘A British Officer in Burmah and Brazil.’ In the place where the reader\nlooks eagerly for some account of the mystery of St. Clare’s disaster\nmay be found the following words: ‘Everywhere else in this book I\nhave narrated things exactly as they occurred, holding as I do the\nold-fashioned opinion that the glory of England is old enough to take\ncare of itself. The exception I shall make is in this matter of\nthe defeat by the Black River; and my reasons, though private, are\nhonourable and compelling. I will, however, add this in justice to the\nmemories of two distinguished men. General St. Clare has been accused\nof incapacity on this occasion; I can at least testify that this action,\nproperly understood, was one of the most brilliant and sagacious of\nhis life. President Olivier by similar report is charged with savage\ninjustice. I think it due to the honour of an enemy to say that he acted\non this occasion with even more than his characteristic good feeling. To\nput the matter popularly, I can assure my countrymen that St. Clare was\nby no means such a fool nor Olivier such a brute as he looked. This is\nall I have to say; nor shall any earthly consideration induce me to add\na word to it.’”\n\nA large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball began to show through the\ntangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator had\nbeen able to refresh his memory of Captain Keith’s text from a scrap of\nprinted paper. As he folded it up and put it back in his pocket Flambeau\nthrew up his hand with a French gesture.\n\n“Wait a bit, wait a bit,” he cried excitedly. “I believe I can guess it\nat the first go.”\n\nHe strode on, breathing hard, his black head and bull neck forward, like\na man winning a walking race. The little priest, amused and interested,\nhad some trouble in trotting beside him. Just before them the trees fell\nback a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a\nclear, moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall\nof another wood. The entrance to the farther forest looked small and\nround, like the black hole of a remote railway tunnel. But it was within\nsome hundred yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again.\n\n“I’ve got it,” he cried at last, slapping his thigh with his great hand.\n“Four minutes’ thinking, and I can tell your whole story myself.”\n\n“All right,” assented his friend. “You tell it.”\n\nFlambeau lifted his head, but lowered his voice. “General Sir Arthur St.\nClare,” he said, “came of a family in which madness was hereditary; and\nhis whole aim was to keep this from his daughter, and even, if possible,\nfrom his future son-in-law. Rightly or wrongly, he thought the final\ncollapse was close, and resolved on suicide. Yet ordinary suicide would\nblazon the very idea he dreaded. As the campaign approached the clouds\ncame thicker on his brain; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his\npublic duty to his private. He rushed rashly into battle, hoping to fall\nby the first shot. When he found that he had only attained capture and\ndiscredit, the sealed bomb in his brain burst, and he broke his own\nsword and hanged himself.”\n\nHe stared firmly at the grey facade of forest in front of him, with the\none black gap in it, like the mouth of the grave, into which their path\nplunged. Perhaps something menacing in the road thus suddenly swallowed\nreinforced his vivid vision of the tragedy, for he shuddered.\n\n“A horrid story,” he said.\n\n“A horrid story,” repeated the priest with bent head. “But not the real\nstory.”\n\nThen he threw back his head with a sort of despair and cried: “Oh, I\nwish it had been.”\n\nThe tall Flambeau faced round and stared at him.\n\n“Yours is a clean story,” cried Father Brown, deeply moved. “A sweet,\npure, honest story, as open and white as that moon. Madness and despair\nare innocent enough. There are worse things, Flambeau.”\n\nFlambeau looked up wildly at the moon thus invoked; and from where he\nstood one black tree-bough curved across it exactly like a devil’s horn.\n\n“Father--father,” cried Flambeau with the French gesture and stepping\nyet more rapidly forward, “do you mean it was worse than that?”\n\n“Worse than that,” said Paul like a grave echo. And they plunged into\nthe black cloister of the woodland, which ran by them in a dim tapestry\nof trunks, like one of the dark corridors in a dream.\n\nThey were soon in the most secret entrails of the wood, and felt close\nabout them foliage that they could not see, when the priest said again:\n\n“Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. But what does he do\nif there is no forest?”\n\n“Well, well,” cried Flambeau irritably, “what does he do?”\n\n“He grows a forest to hide it in,” said the priest in an obscure voice.\n“A fearful sin.”\n\n“Look here,” cried his friend impatiently, for the dark wood and the\ndark saying got a little on his nerves; “will you tell me this story or\nnot? What other evidence is there to go on?”\n\n“There are three more bits of evidence,” said the other, “that I have\ndug up in holes and corners; and I will give them in logical rather\nthan chronological order. First of all, of course, our authority for the\nissue and event of the battle is in Olivier’s own dispatches, which\nare lucid enough. He was entrenched with two or three regiments on the\nheights that swept down to the Black River, on the other side of which\nwas lower and more marshy ground. Beyond this again was gently rising\ncountry, on which was the first English outpost, supported by others\nwhich lay, however, considerably in its rear. The British forces as a\nwhole were greatly superior in numbers; but this particular regiment was\njust far enough from its base to make Olivier consider the project of\ncrossing the river to cut it off. By sunset, however, he had decided to\nretain his own position, which was a specially strong one. At daybreak\nnext morning he was thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of\nEnglish, entirely unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves\nacross the river, half by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a\nford higher up, and were massed upon the marshy bank below him.\n\n“That they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a\nposition was incredible enough; but Olivier noticed something yet more\nextraordinary. For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground,\nthis mad regiment, having put the river in its rear by one wild charge,\ndid nothing more, but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle.\nNeedless to say, the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery,\nwhich they could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire. Yet\nthey never broke; and Olivier’s curt account ends with a strong tribute\nof admiration for the mystic valour of these imbeciles. ‘Our line then\nadvanced finally,’ writes Olivier, ‘and drove them into the river;\nwe captured General St. Clare himself and several other officers. The\ncolonel and the major had both fallen in the battle. I cannot resist\nsaying that few finer sights can have been seen in history than the last\nstand of this extraordinary regiment; wounded officers picking up the\nrifles of dead soldiers, and the general himself facing us on horseback\nbareheaded and with a broken sword.’ On what happened to the general\nafterwards Olivier is as silent as Captain Keith.”\n\n“Well,” grunted Flambeau, “get on to the next bit of evidence.”\n\n“The next evidence,” said Father Brown, “took some time to find, but it\nwill not take long to tell. I found at last in an almshouse down in the\nLincolnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black\nRiver, but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when\nhe died. This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy, a big bull of an\nIrishman; and it would seem that he died almost as much of rage as of\nbullets. He, at any rate, was not responsible for that ridiculous raid;\nit must have been imposed on him by the general. His last edifying\nwords, according to my informant, were these: ‘And there goes the damned\nold donkey with the end of his sword knocked off. I wish it was his\nhead.’ You will remark that everyone seems to have noticed this detail\nabout the broken sword blade, though most people regard it somewhat\nmore reverently than did the late Colonel Clancy. And now for the third\nfragment.”\n\nTheir path through the woodland began to go upward, and the speaker\npaused a little for breath before he went on. Then he continued in the\nsame business-like tone:\n\n“Only a month or two ago a certain Brazilian official died in England,\nhaving quarrelled with Olivier and left his country. He was a well-known\nfigure both here and on the Continent, a Spaniard named Espado; I knew\nhim myself, a yellow-faced old dandy, with a hooked nose. For various\nprivate reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left; he\nwas a Catholic, of course, and I had been with him towards the end.\nThere was nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St. Clare\nbusiness, except five or six common exercise books filled with the diary\nof some English soldier. I can only suppose that it was found by the\nBrazilians on one of those that fell. Anyhow, it stopped abruptly the\nnight before the battle.\n\n“But the account of that last day in the poor fellow’s life was\ncertainly worth reading. I have it on me; but it’s too dark to read it\nhere, and I will give you a resume. The first part of that entry is full\nof jokes, evidently flung about among the men, about somebody called the\nVulture. It does not seem as if this person, whoever he was, was one of\nthemselves, nor even an Englishman; neither is he exactly spoken of as\none of the enemy. It sounds rather as if he were some local go-between\nand non-combatant; perhaps a guide or a journalist. He has been closeted\nwith old Colonel Clancy; but is more often seen talking to the major.\nIndeed, the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier’s narrative;\na lean, dark-haired man, apparently, of the name of Murray--a north of\nIreland man and a Puritan. There are continual jests about the contrast\nbetween this Ulsterman’s austerity and the conviviality of\nColonel Clancy. There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing\nbright-coloured clothes.\n\n“But all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the\nnote of a bugle. Behind the English camp and almost parallel to the\nriver ran one of the few great roads of that district. Westward the road\ncurved round towards the river, which it crossed by the bridge before\nmentioned. To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds, and some\ntwo miles along it was the next English outpost. From this direction\nthere came along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of\nlight cavalry, in which even the simple diarist could recognise with\nastonishment the general with his staff. He rode the great white horse\nwhich you have seen so often in illustrated papers and Academy pictures;\nand you may be sure that the salute they gave him was not merely\nceremonial. He, at least, wasted no time on ceremony, but, springing\nfrom the saddle immediately, mixed with the group of officers, and fell\ninto emphatic though confidential speech. What struck our friend the\ndiarist most was his special disposition to discuss matters with Major\nMurray; but, indeed, such a selection, so long as it was not marked, was\nin no way unnatural. The two men were made for sympathy; they were men\nwho ‘read their Bibles’; they were both the old Evangelical type of\nofficer. However this may be, it is certain that when the general\nmounted again he was still talking earnestly to Murray; and that as\nhe walked his horse slowly down the road towards the river, the tall\nUlsterman still walked by his bridle rein in earnest debate. The\nsoldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a clump of trees\nwhere the road turned towards the river. The colonel had gone back to\nhis tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the diary lingered\nfor another four minutes, and saw a marvellous sight.\n\n“The great white horse which had marched slowly down the road, as it had\nmarched in so many processions, flew back, galloping up the road towards\nthem as if it were mad to win a race. At first they thought it had run\naway with the man on its back; but they soon saw that the general, a\nfine rider, was himself urging it to full speed. Horse and man swept up\nto them like a whirlwind; and then, reining up the reeling charger, the\ngeneral turned on them a face like flame, and called for the colonel\nlike the trumpet that wakes the dead.\n\n“I conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled\non top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our\nfriend with the diary. With the dazed excitement of a dream, they found\nthemselves falling--literally falling--into their ranks, and learned\nthat an attack was to be led at once across the river. The general and\nthe major, it was said, had found out something at the bridge, and there\nwas only just time to strike for life. The major had gone back at once\nto call up the reserve along the road behind; it was doubtful if even\nwith that prompt appeal help could reach them in time. But they must\npass the stream that night, and seize the heights by morning. It is with\nthe very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary\nsuddenly ends.”\n\nFather Brown had mounted ahead; for the woodland path grew smaller,\nsteeper, and more twisted, till they felt as if they were ascending\na winding staircase. The priest’s voice came from above out of the\ndarkness.\n\n“There was one other little and enormous thing. When the general urged\nthem to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard;\nand then, as if ashamed of such melodrama, thrust it back again. The\nsword again, you see.”\n\nA half-light broke through the network of boughs above them, flinging\nthe ghost of a net about their feet; for they were mounting again to the\nfaint luminosity of the naked night. Flambeau felt truth all round him\nas an atmosphere, but not as an idea. He answered with bewildered brain:\n“Well, what’s the matter with the sword? Officers generally have swords,\ndon’t they?”\n\n“They are not often mentioned in modern war,” said the other\ndispassionately; “but in this affair one falls over the blessed sword\neverywhere.”\n\n“Well, what is there in that?” growled Flambeau; “it was a twopence\ncoloured sort of incident; the old man’s blade breaking in his last\nbattle. Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it, as they have.\nOn all these tombs and things it’s shown broken at the point. I hope you\nhaven’t dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men\nwith an eye for a picture saw St. Clare’s broken sword.”\n\n“No,” cried Father Brown, with a sharp voice like a pistol shot; “but\nwho saw his unbroken sword?”\n\n“What do you mean?” cried the other, and stood still under the stars.\nThey had come abruptly out of the grey gates of the wood.\n\n“I say, who saw his unbroken sword?” repeated Father Brown obstinately.\n“Not the writer of the diary, anyhow; the general sheathed it in time.”\n\nFlambeau looked about him in the moonlight, as a man struck blind\nmight look in the sun; and his friend went on, for the first time with\neagerness:\n\n“Flambeau,” he cried, “I cannot prove it, even after hunting through the\ntombs. But I am sure of it. Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips\nthe whole thing over. The colonel, by a strange chance, was one of the\nfirst struck by a bullet. He was struck long before the troops came to\nclose quarters. But he saw St. Clare’s sword broken. Why was it broken?\nHow was it broken? My friend, it was broken before the battle.”\n\n“Oh!” said his friend, with a sort of forlorn jocularity; “and pray\nwhere is the other piece?”\n\n“I can tell you,” said the priest promptly. “In the northeast corner of\nthe cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast.”\n\n“Indeed?” inquired the other. “Have you looked for it?”\n\n“I couldn’t,” replied Brown, with frank regret. “There’s a great marble\nmonument on top of it; a monument to the heroic Major Murray, who fell\nfighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River.”\n\nFlambeau seemed suddenly galvanised into existence. “You mean,” he cried\nhoarsely, “that General St. Clare hated Murray, and murdered him on the\nfield of battle because--”\n\n“You are still full of good and pure thoughts,” said the other. “It was\nworse than that.”\n\n“Well,” said the large man, “my stock of evil imagination is used up.”\n\nThe priest seemed really doubtful where to begin, and at last he said\nagain:\n\n“Where would a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.”\n\nThe other did not answer.\n\n“If there were no forest, he would make a forest. And if he wished to\nhide a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.”\n\nThere was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and\nquietly:\n\n“And if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead\nbodies to hide it in.”\n\nFlambeau began to stamp forward with an intolerance of delay in time\nor space; but Father Brown went on as if he were continuing the last\nsentence:\n\n“Sir Arthur St. Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read\nhis Bible. That was what was the matter with him. When will people\nunderstand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also\nreads everybody else’s Bible? A printer reads a Bible for misprints. A\nMormon reads his Bible, and finds polygamy; a Christian Scientist\nreads his, and finds we have no arms and legs. St. Clare was an old\nAnglo-Indian Protestant soldier. Now, just think what that might\nmean; and, for Heaven’s sake, don’t cant about it. It might mean a man\nphysically formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society,\nand soaking himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book. Of\ncourse, he read the Old Testament rather than the New. Of course, he\nfound in the Old Testament anything that he wanted--lust, tyranny,\ntreason. Oh, I dare say he was honest, as you call it. But what is the\ngood of a man being honest in his worship of dishonesty?\n\n“In each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a\nharem, he tortured witnesses, he amassed shameful gold; but certainly\nhe would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the\nLord. My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord?\nAnyhow, there is this about such evil, that it opens door after door\nin hell, and always into smaller and smaller chambers. This is the real\ncase against crime, that a man does not become wilder and wilder, but\nonly meaner and meaner. St. Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of\nbribery and blackmail; and needed more and more cash. And by the time of\nthe Battle of the Black River he had fallen from world to world to that\nplace which Dante makes the lowest floor of the universe.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked his friend again.\n\n“I mean that,” retorted the cleric, and suddenly pointed at a puddle\nsealed with ice that shone in the moon. “Do you remember whom Dante put\nin the last circle of ice?”\n\n“The traitors,” said Flambeau, and shuddered. As he looked around at the\ninhuman landscape of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines,\nhe could almost fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a\nvoice was, indeed, a Virgil leading him through a land of eternal sins.\n\nThe voice went on: “Olivier, as you know, was quixotic, and would not\npermit a secret service and spies. The thing, however, was done, like\nmany other things, behind his back. It was managed by my old friend\nEspado; he was the bright-clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the\nVulture. Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front, he felt his\nway through the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one\ncorrupt man--please God!--and that man at the top. St. Clare was in foul\nneed of money, and mountains of it. The discredited family doctor was\nthreatening those extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and\nwere broken off; tales of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane;\nthings done by an English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and\nhordes of slaves. Money was wanted, too, for his daughter’s dowry; for\nto him the fame of wealth was as sweet as wealth itself. He snapped the\nlast thread, whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the\nenemies of England. But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as\nwell as he. Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed\nthe hideous truth; and when they walked slowly together down that road\ntowards the bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign\ninstantly, or be court-martialled and shot. The general temporised with\nhim till they came to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and\nthere by the singing river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the\npicture) the general drew his sabre and plunged it through the body of\nthe major.”\n\nThe wintry road curved over a ridge in cutting frost, with cruel black\nshapes of bush and thicket; but Flambeau fancied that he saw beyond it\nfaintly the edge of an aureole that was not starlight and moonlight, but\nsome fire such as is made by men. He watched it as the tale drew to its\nclose.\n\n“St. Clare was a hell-hound, but he was a hound of breed. Never, I’ll\nswear, was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump\nat his feet. Never in all his triumphs, as Captain Keith said truly, was\nthe great man so great as he was in this last world-despised defeat. He\nlooked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood; he saw the point he\nhad planted between his victim’s shoulders had broken off in the body.\nHe saw quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow.\nHe saw that men must find the unaccountable corpse; must extract\nthe unaccountable sword-point; must notice the unaccountable broken\nsword--or absence of sword. He had killed, but not silenced. But his\nimperious intellect rose against the facer; there was one way yet. He\ncould make the corpse less unaccountable. He could create a hill of\ncorpses to cover this one. In twenty minutes eight hundred English\nsoldiers were marching down to their death.”\n\nThe warmer glow behind the black winter wood grew richer and brighter,\nand Flambeau strode on to reach it. Father Brown also quickened his\nstride; but he seemed merely absorbed in his tale.\n\n“Such was the valour of that English thousand, and such the genius of\ntheir commander, that if they had at once attacked the hill, even their\nmad march might have met some luck. But the evil mind that played with\nthem like pawns had other aims and reasons. They must remain in the\nmarshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a\ncommon sight there. Then for the last grand scene; the silver-haired\nsoldier-saint would give up his shattered sword to save further\nslaughter. Oh, it was well organised for an impromptu. But I think (I\ncannot prove), I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody\nmire that someone doubted--and someone guessed.”\n\nHe was mute a moment, and then said: “There is a voice from nowhere that\ntells me the man who guessed was the lover... the man to wed the old\nman’s child.”\n\n“But what about Olivier and the hanging?” asked Flambeau.\n\n“Olivier, partly from chivalry, partly from policy, seldom encumbered\nhis march with captives,” explained the narrator. “He released everybody\nin most cases. He released everybody in this case.”\n\n“Everybody but the general,” said the tall man.\n\n“Everybody,” said the priest.\n\nFlambeau knit his black brows. “I don’t grasp it all yet,” he said.\n\n“There is another picture, Flambeau,” said Brown in his more mystical\nundertone. “I can’t prove it; but I can do more--I can see it. There is\na camp breaking up on the bare, torrid hills at morning, and Brazilian\nuniforms massed in blocks and columns to march. There is the red\nshirt and long black beard of Olivier, which blows as he stands, his\nbroad-brimmed hat in his hand. He is saying farewell to the great enemy\nhe is setting free--the simple, snow-headed English veteran, who\nthanks him in the name of his men. The English remnant stand behind\nat attention; beside them are stores and vehicles for the retreat.\nThe drums roll; the Brazilians are moving; the English are still like\nstatues. So they abide till the last hum and flash of the enemy have\nfaded from the tropic horizon. Then they alter their postures all at\nonce, like dead men coming to life; they turn their fifty faces upon the\ngeneral--faces not to be forgotten.”\n\nFlambeau gave a great jump. “Ah,” he cried, “you don’t mean--”\n\n“Yes,” said Father Brown in a deep, moving voice. “It was an English\nhand that put the rope round St. Clare’s neck; I believe the hand that\nput the ring on his daughter’s finger. They were English hands that\ndragged him up to the tree of shame; the hands of men that had adored\nhim and followed him to victory. And they were English souls (God pardon\nand endure us all!) who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on\nthe green gallows of palm, and prayed in their hatred that he might drop\noff it into hell.”\n\nAs the two topped the ridge there burst on them the strong scarlet light\nof a red-curtained English inn. It stood sideways in the road, as if\nstanding aside in the amplitude of hospitality. Its three doors stood\nopen with invitation; and even where they stood they could hear the hum\nand laughter of humanity happy for a night.\n\n“I need not tell you more,” said Father Brown. “They tried him in the\nwilderness and destroyed him; and then, for the honour of England and\nof his daughter, they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the\ntraitor’s purse and the assassin’s sword blade. Perhaps--Heaven help\nthem--they tried to forget it. Let us try to forget it, anyhow; here is\nour inn.”\n\n“With all my heart,” said Flambeau, and was just striding into the\nbright, noisy bar when he stepped back and almost fell on the road.\n\n“Look there, in the devil’s name!” he cried, and pointed rigidly at the\nsquare wooden sign that overhung the road. It showed dimly the crude\nshape of a sabre hilt and a shortened blade; and was inscribed in false\narchaic lettering, “The Sign of the Broken Sword.”\n\n“Were you not prepared?” asked Father Brown gently. “He is the god of\nthis country; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him\nand his story.”\n\n“I thought we had done with the leper,” cried Flambeau, and spat on the\nroad.\n\n“You will never have done with him in England,” said the priest, looking\ndown, “while brass is strong and stone abides. His marble statues will\nerect the souls of proud, innocent boys for centuries, his village tomb\nwill smell of loyalty as of lilies. Millions who never knew him shall\nlove him like a father--this man whom the last few that knew him dealt\nwith like dung. He shall be a saint; and the truth shall never be told\nof him, because I have made up my mind at last. There is so much good\nand evil in breaking secrets, that I put my conduct to a test. All these\nnewspapers will perish; the anti-Brazil boom is already over; Olivier\nis already honoured everywhere. But I told myself that if anywhere, by\nname, in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids, Colonel\nClancy, or Captain Keith, or President Olivier, or any innocent man was\nwrongly blamed, then I would speak. If it were only that St. Clare was\nwrongly praised, I would be silent. And I will.”\n\nThey plunged into the red-curtained tavern, which was not only cosy, but\neven luxurious inside. On a table stood a silver model of the tomb of\nSt. Clare, the silver head bowed, the silver sword broken. On the\nwalls were coloured photographs of the same scene, and of the system\nof wagonettes that took tourists to see it. They sat down on the\ncomfortable padded benches.\n\n“Come, it’s cold,” cried Father Brown; “let’s have some wine or beer.”\n\n“Or brandy,” said Flambeau.\n\n\n\n\nThe Three Tools of Death\n\n\nBoth by calling and conviction Father Brown knew better than most of us,\nthat every man is dignified when he is dead. But even he felt a pang of\nincongruity when he was knocked up at daybreak and told that Sir Aaron\nArmstrong had been murdered. There was something absurd and unseemly\nabout secret violence in connection with so entirely entertaining and\npopular a figure. For Sir Aaron Armstrong was entertaining to the point\nof being comic; and popular in such a manner as to be almost legendary.\nIt was like hearing that Sunny Jim had hanged himself; or that Mr.\nPickwick had died in Hanwell. For though Sir Aaron was a philanthropist,\nand thus dealt with the darker side of our society, he prided himself\non dealing with it in the brightest possible style. His political and\nsocial speeches were cataracts of anecdotes and “loud laughter”; his\nbodily health was of a bursting sort; his ethics were all optimism; and\nhe dealt with the Drink problem (his favourite topic) with that immortal\nor even monotonous gaiety which is so often a mark of the prosperous\ntotal abstainer.\n\nThe established story of his conversion was familiar on the more\npuritanic platforms and pulpits, how he had been, when only a boy, drawn\naway from Scotch theology to Scotch whisky, and how he had risen out of\nboth and become (as he modestly put it) what he was. Yet his wide\nwhite beard, cherubic face, and sparkling spectacles, at the numberless\ndinners and congresses where they appeared, made it hard to believe,\nsomehow, that he had ever been anything so morbid as either a\ndram-drinker or a Calvinist. He was, one felt, the most seriously merry\nof all the sons of men.\n\nHe had lived on the rural skirt of Hampstead in a handsome house, high\nbut not broad, a modern and prosaic tower. The narrowest of its narrow\nsides overhung the steep green bank of a railway, and was shaken by\npassing trains. Sir Aaron Armstrong, as he boisterously explained, had\nno nerves. But if the train had often given a shock to the house, that\nmorning the tables were turned, and it was the house that gave a shock\nto the train.\n\nThe engine slowed down and stopped just beyond that point where an angle\nof the house impinged upon the sharp slope of turf. The arrest of most\nmechanical things must be slow; but the living cause of this had been\nvery rapid. A man clad completely in black, even (it was remembered)\nto the dreadful detail of black gloves, appeared on the ridge above\nthe engine, and waved his black hands like some sable windmill. This in\nitself would hardly have stopped even a lingering train. But there came\nout of him a cry which was talked of afterwards as something utterly\nunnatural and new. It was one of those shouts that are horridly distinct\neven when we cannot hear what is shouted. The word in this case was\n“Murder!”\n\nBut the engine-driver swears he would have pulled up just the same if he\nhad heard only the dreadful and definite accent and not the word.\n\nThe train once arrested, the most superficial stare could take in many\nfeatures of the tragedy. The man in black on the green bank was Sir\nAaron Armstrong’s man-servant Magnus. The baronet in his optimism had\noften laughed at the black gloves of this dismal attendant; but no one\nwas likely to laugh at him just now.\n\nSo soon as an inquirer or two had stepped off the line and across the\nsmoky hedge, they saw, rolled down almost to the bottom of the bank, the\nbody of an old man in a yellow dressing-gown with a very vivid\nscarlet lining. A scrap of rope seemed caught about his leg, entangled\npresumably in a struggle. There was a smear or so of blood, though very\nlittle; but the body was bent or broken into a posture impossible to any\nliving thing. It was Sir Aaron Armstrong. A few more bewildered moments\nbrought out a big fair-bearded man, whom some travellers could salute\nas the dead man’s secretary, Patrick Royce, once well known in Bohemian\nsociety and even famous in the Bohemian arts. In a manner more vague,\nbut even more convincing, he echoed the agony of the servant. By the\ntime the third figure of that household, Alice Armstrong, daughter of\nthe dead man, had come already tottering and waving into the garden, the\nengine-driver had put a stop to his stoppage. The whistle had blown and\nthe train had panted on to get help from the next station.\n\nFather Brown had been thus rapidly summoned at the request of Patrick\nRoyce, the big ex-Bohemian secretary. Royce was an Irishman by birth;\nand that casual kind of Catholic that never remembers his religion\nuntil he is really in a hole. But Royce’s request might have been less\npromptly complied with if one of the official detectives had not been a\nfriend and admirer of the unofficial Flambeau; and it was impossible to\nbe a friend of Flambeau without hearing numberless stories about Father\nBrown. Hence, while the young detective (whose name was Merton) led\nthe little priest across the fields to the railway, their talk was more\nconfidential than could be expected between two total strangers.\n\n“As far as I can see,” said Mr. Merton candidly, “there is no sense\nto be made of it at all. There is nobody one can suspect. Magnus is a\nsolemn old fool; far too much of a fool to be an assassin. Royce has\nbeen the baronet’s best friend for years; and his daughter undoubtedly\nadored him. Besides, it’s all too absurd. Who would kill such a cheery\nold chap as Armstrong? Who could dip his hands in the gore of an\nafter-dinner speaker? It would be like killing Father Christmas.”\n\n“Yes, it was a cheery house,” assented Father Brown. “It was a cheery\nhouse while he was alive. Do you think it will be cheery now he is\ndead?”\n\nMerton started a little and regarded his companion with an enlivened\neye. “Now he is dead?” he repeated.\n\n“Yes,” continued the priest stolidly, “he was cheerful. But did he\ncommunicate his cheerfulness? Frankly, was anyone else in the house\ncheerful but he?”\n\nA window in Merton’s mind let in that strange light of surprise in which\nwe see for the first time things we have known all along. He had often\nbeen to the Armstrongs’, on little police jobs of the philanthropist;\nand, now he came to think of it, it was in itself a depressing house.\nThe rooms were very high and very cold; the decoration mean and\nprovincial; the draughty corridors were lit by electricity that was\nbleaker than moonlight. And though the old man’s scarlet face and silver\nbeard had blazed like a bonfire in each room or passage in turn, it did\nnot leave any warmth behind it. Doubtless this spectral discomfort in\nthe place was partly due to the very vitality and exuberance of its\nowner; he needed no stoves or lamps, he would say, but carried his own\nwarmth with him. But when Merton recalled the other inmates, he was\ncompelled to confess that they also were as shadows of their lord.\nThe moody man-servant, with his monstrous black gloves, was almost a\nnightmare; Royce, the secretary, was solid enough, a big bull of a\nman, in tweeds, with a short beard; but the straw-coloured beard was\nstartlingly salted with grey like the tweeds, and the broad forehead was\nbarred with premature wrinkles. He was good-natured enough also, but it\nwas a sad sort of good-nature, almost a heart-broken sort--he had the\ngeneral air of being some sort of failure in life. As for Armstrong’s\ndaughter, it was almost incredible that she was his daughter; she was so\npallid in colour and sensitive in outline. She was graceful, but there\nwas a quiver in the very shape of her that was like the lines of an\naspen. Merton had sometimes wondered if she had learnt to quail at the\ncrash of the passing trains.\n\n“You see,” said Father Brown, blinking modestly, “I’m not sure that the\nArmstrong cheerfulness is so very cheerful--for other people. You say\nthat nobody could kill such a happy old man, but I’m not sure; ne nos\ninducas in tentationem. If ever I murdered somebody,” he added quite\nsimply, “I dare say it might be an Optimist.”\n\n“Why?” cried Merton amused. “Do you think people dislike cheerfulness?”\n\n“People like frequent laughter,” answered Father Brown, “but I don’t\nthink they like a permanent smile. Cheerfulness without humour is a very\ntrying thing.”\n\nThey walked some way in silence along the windy grassy bank by the rail,\nand just as they came under the far-flung shadow of the tall Armstrong\nhouse, Father Brown said suddenly, like a man throwing away a\ntroublesome thought rather than offering it seriously: “Of course, drink\nis neither good nor bad in itself. But I can’t help sometimes feeling\nthat men like Armstrong want an occasional glass of wine to sadden\nthem.”\n\nMerton’s official superior, a grizzled and capable detective named\nGilder, was standing on the green bank waiting for the coroner, talking\nto Patrick Royce, whose big shoulders and bristly beard and hair towered\nabove him. This was the more noticeable because Royce walked always\nwith a sort of powerful stoop, and seemed to be going about his small\nclerical and domestic duties in a heavy and humbled style, like a\nbuffalo drawing a go-cart.\n\nHe raised his head with unusual pleasure at the sight of the priest, and\ntook him a few paces apart. Meanwhile Merton was addressing the\nolder detective respectfully indeed, but not without a certain boyish\nimpatience.\n\n“Well, Mr. Gilder, have you got much farther with the mystery?”\n\n“There is no mystery,” replied Gilder, as he looked under dreamy eyelids\nat the rooks.\n\n“Well, there is for me, at any rate,” said Merton, smiling.\n\n“It is simple enough, my boy,” observed the senior investigator,\nstroking his grey, pointed beard. “Three minutes after you’d gone for\nMr. Royce’s parson the whole thing came out. You know that pasty-faced\nservant in the black gloves who stopped the train?”\n\n“I should know him anywhere. Somehow he rather gave me the creeps.”\n\n“Well,” drawled Gilder, “when the train had gone on again, that man had\ngone too. Rather a cool criminal, don’t you think, to escape by the very\ntrain that went off for the police?”\n\n“You’re pretty sure, I suppose,” remarked the young man, “that he really\ndid kill his master?”\n\n“Yes, my son, I’m pretty sure,” replied Gilder drily, “for the trifling\nreason that he has gone off with twenty thousand pounds in papers that\nwere in his master’s desk. No, the only thing worth calling a difficulty\nis how he killed him. The skull seems broken as with some big weapon,\nbut there’s no weapon at all lying about, and the murderer would have\nfound it awkward to carry it away, unless the weapon was too small to be\nnoticed.”\n\n“Perhaps the weapon was too big to be noticed,” said the priest, with an\nodd little giggle.\n\nGilder looked round at this wild remark, and rather sternly asked Brown\nwhat he meant.\n\n“Silly way of putting it, I know,” said Father Brown apologetically.\n“Sounds like a fairy tale. But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant’s\nclub, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the\nearth. He was broken against this green bank we are standing on.”\n\n“How do you mean?” asked the detective quickly.\n\nFather Brown turned his moon face up to the narrow facade of the house\nand blinked hopelessly up. Following his eyes, they saw that right at\nthe top of this otherwise blind back quarter of the building, an attic\nwindow stood open.\n\n“Don’t you see,” he explained, pointing a little awkwardly like a child,\n“he was thrown down from there?”\n\nGilder frowningly scrutinised the window, and then said: “Well, it is\ncertainly possible. But I don’t see why you are so sure about it.”\n\nBrown opened his grey eyes wide. “Why,” he said, “there’s a bit of rope\nround the dead man’s leg. Don’t you see that other bit of rope up there\ncaught at the corner of the window?”\n\nAt that height the thing looked like the faintest particle of dust\nor hair, but the shrewd old investigator was satisfied. “You’re quite\nright, sir,” he said to Father Brown; “that is certainly one to you.”\n\nAlmost as he spoke a special train with one carriage took the curve\nof the line on their left, and, stopping, disgorged another group\nof policemen, in whose midst was the hangdog visage of Magnus, the\nabsconded servant.\n\n“By Jove! they’ve got him,” cried Gilder, and stepped forward with quite\na new alertness.\n\n“Have you got the money!” he cried to the first policeman.\n\nThe man looked him in the face with a rather curious expression and\nsaid: “No.” Then he added: “At least, not here.”\n\n“Which is the inspector, please?” asked the man called Magnus.\n\nWhen he spoke everyone instantly understood how this voice had stopped\na train. He was a dull-looking man with flat black hair, a colourless\nface, and a faint suggestion of the East in the level slits in his eyes\nand mouth. His blood and name, indeed, had remained dubious, ever since\nSir Aaron had “rescued” him from a waitership in a London restaurant,\nand (as some said) from more infamous things. But his voice was as vivid\nas his face was dead. Whether through exactitude in a foreign language,\nor in deference to his master (who had been somewhat deaf), Magnus’s\ntones had a peculiarly ringing and piercing quality, and the whole group\nquite jumped when he spoke.\n\n“I always knew this would happen,” he said aloud with brazen blandness.\n“My poor old master made game of me for wearing black; but I always said\nI should be ready for his funeral.”\n\nAnd he made a momentary movement with his two dark-gloved hands.\n\n“Sergeant,” said Inspector Gilder, eyeing the black hands with wrath,\n“aren’t you putting the bracelets on this fellow; he looks pretty\ndangerous.”\n\n“Well, sir,” said the sergeant, with the same odd look of wonder, “I\ndon’t know that we can.”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the other sharply. “Haven’t you arrested him?”\n\nA faint scorn widened the slit-like mouth, and the whistle of an\napproaching train seemed oddly to echo the mockery.\n\n“We arrested him,” replied the sergeant gravely, “just as he was coming\nout of the police station at Highgate, where he had deposited all his\nmaster’s money in the care of Inspector Robinson.”\n\nGilder looked at the man-servant in utter amazement. “Why on earth did\nyou do that?” he asked of Magnus.\n\n“To keep it safe from the criminal, of course,” replied that person\nplacidly.\n\n“Surely,” said Gilder, “Sir Aaron’s money might have been safely left\nwith Sir Aaron’s family.”\n\nThe tail of his sentence was drowned in the roar of the train as it went\nrocking and clanking; but through all the hell of noises to which that\nunhappy house was periodically subject, they could hear the syllables of\nMagnus’s answer, in all their bell-like distinctness: “I have no reason\nto feel confidence in Sir Aaron’s family.”\n\nAll the motionless men had the ghostly sensation of the presence of some\nnew person; and Merton was scarcely surprised when he looked up and saw\nthe pale face of Armstrong’s daughter over Father Brown’s shoulder. She\nwas still young and beautiful in a silvery style, but her hair was of so\ndusty and hueless a brown that in some shadows it seemed to have turned\ntotally grey.\n\n“Be careful what you say,” said Royce gruffly, “you’ll frighten Miss\nArmstrong.”\n\n“I hope so,” said the man with the clear voice.\n\nAs the woman winced and everyone else wondered, he went on: “I am\nsomewhat used to Miss Armstrong’s tremors. I have seen her trembling off\nand on for years. And some said she was shaking with cold and some she\nwas shaking with fear, but I know she was shaking with hate and wicked\nanger--fiends that have had their feast this morning. She would have\nbeen away by now with her lover and all the money but for me. Ever since\nmy poor old master prevented her from marrying that tipsy blackguard--”\n\n“Stop,” said Gilder very sternly. “We have nothing to do with your\nfamily fancies or suspicions. Unless you have some practical evidence,\nyour mere opinions--”\n\n“Oh! I’ll give you practical evidence,” cut in Magnus, in his hacking\naccent. “You’ll have to subpoena me, Mr. Inspector, and I shall have to\ntell the truth. And the truth is this: An instant after the old man was\npitched bleeding out of the window, I ran into the attic, and found\nhis daughter swooning on the floor with a red dagger still in her hand.\nAllow me to hand that also to the proper authorities.” He took from his\ntail-pocket a long horn-hilted knife with a red smear on it, and handed\nit politely to the sergeant. Then he stood back again, and his slits of\neyes almost faded from his face in one fat Chinese sneer.\n\nMerton felt an almost bodily sickness at the sight of him; and he\nmuttered to Gilder: “Surely you would take Miss Armstrong’s word against\nhis?”\n\nFather Brown suddenly lifted a face so absurdly fresh that it looked\nsomehow as if he had just washed it. “Yes,” he said, radiating\ninnocence, “but is Miss Armstrong’s word against his?”\n\nThe girl uttered a startled, singular little cry; everyone looked at\nher. Her figure was rigid as if paralysed; only her face within its\nframe of faint brown hair was alive with an appalling surprise. She\nstood like one of a sudden lassooed and throttled.\n\n“This man,” said Mr. Gilder gravely, “actually says that you were found\ngrasping a knife, insensible, after the murder.”\n\n“He says the truth,” answered Alice.\n\nThe next fact of which they were conscious was that Patrick Royce strode\nwith his great stooping head into their ring and uttered the singular\nwords: “Well, if I’ve got to go, I’ll have a bit of pleasure first.”\n\nHis huge shoulder heaved and he sent an iron fist smash into Magnus’s\nbland Mongolian visage, laying him on the lawn as flat as a starfish.\nTwo or three of the police instantly put their hands on Royce; but to\nthe rest it seemed as if all reason had broken up and the universe were\nturning into a brainless harlequinade.\n\n“None of that, Mr. Royce,” Gilder had called out authoritatively. “I\nshall arrest you for assault.”\n\n“No, you won’t,” answered the secretary in a voice like an iron gong,\n“you will arrest me for murder.”\n\nGilder threw an alarmed glance at the man knocked down; but since that\noutraged person was already sitting up and wiping a little blood off a\nsubstantially uninjured face, he only said shortly: “What do you mean?”\n\n“It is quite true, as this fellow says,” explained Royce, “that Miss\nArmstrong fainted with a knife in her hand. But she had not snatched the\nknife to attack her father, but to defend him.”\n\n“To defend him,” repeated Gilder gravely. “Against whom?”\n\n“Against me,” answered the secretary.\n\nAlice looked at him with a complex and baffling face; then she said in a\nlow voice: “After it all, I am still glad you are brave.”\n\n“Come upstairs,” said Patrick Royce heavily, “and I will show you the\nwhole cursed thing.”\n\nThe attic, which was the secretary’s private place (and rather a small\ncell for so large a hermit), had indeed all the vestiges of a violent\ndrama. Near the centre of the floor lay a large revolver as if flung\naway; nearer to the left was rolled a whisky bottle, open but not quite\nempty. The cloth of the little table lay dragged and trampled, and a\nlength of cord, like that found on the corpse, was cast wildly across\nthe windowsill. Two vases were smashed on the mantelpiece and one on the\ncarpet.\n\n“I was drunk,” said Royce; and this simplicity in the prematurely\nbattered man somehow had the pathos of the first sin of a baby.\n\n“You all know about me,” he continued huskily; “everybody knows how my\nstory began, and it may as well end like that too. I was called a clever\nman once, and might have been a happy one; Armstrong saved the remains\nof a brain and body from the taverns, and was always kind to me in his\nown way, poor fellow! Only he wouldn’t let me marry Alice here; and it\nwill always be said that he was right enough. Well, you can form your\nown conclusions, and you won’t want me to go into details. That is my\nwhisky bottle half emptied in the corner; that is my revolver quite\nemptied on the carpet. It was the rope from my box that was found on the\ncorpse, and it was from my window the corpse was thrown. You need not\nset detectives to grub up my tragedy; it is a common enough weed in this\nworld. I give myself to the gallows; and, by God, that is enough!”\n\nAt a sufficiently delicate sign, the police gathered round the large man\nto lead him away; but their unobtrusiveness was somewhat staggered by\nthe remarkable appearance of Father Brown, who was on his hands and\nknees on the carpet in the doorway, as if engaged in some kind of\nundignified prayers. Being a person utterly insensible to the social\nfigure he cut, he remained in this posture, but turned a bright round\nface up at the company, presenting the appearance of a quadruped with a\nvery comic human head.\n\n“I say,” he said good-naturedly, “this really won’t do at all, you know.\nAt the beginning you said we’d found no weapon. But now we’re finding\ntoo many; there’s the knife to stab, and the rope to strangle, and the\npistol to shoot; and after all he broke his neck by falling out of a\nwindow! It won’t do. It’s not economical.” And he shook his head at the\nground as a horse does grazing.\n\nInspector Gilder had opened his mouth with serious intentions, but\nbefore he could speak the grotesque figure on the floor had gone on\nquite volubly.\n\n“And now three quite impossible things. First, these holes in the\ncarpet, where the six bullets have gone in. Why on earth should anybody\nfire at the carpet? A drunken man lets fly at his enemy’s head, the\nthing that’s grinning at him. He doesn’t pick a quarrel with his feet,\nor lay siege to his slippers. And then there’s the rope”--and having\ndone with the carpet the speaker lifted his hands and put them in his\npocket, but continued unaffectedly on his knees--“in what conceivable\nintoxication would anybody try to put a rope round a man’s neck and\nfinally put it round his leg? Royce, anyhow, was not so drunk as that,\nor he would be sleeping like a log by now. And, plainest of all, the\nwhisky bottle. You suggest a dipsomaniac fought for the whisky bottle,\nand then having won, rolled it away in a corner, spilling one half and\nleaving the other. That is the very last thing a dipsomaniac would do.”\n\nHe scrambled awkwardly to his feet, and said to the self-accused\nmurderer in tones of limpid penitence: “I’m awfully sorry, my dear sir,\nbut your tale is really rubbish.”\n\n“Sir,” said Alice Armstrong in a low tone to the priest, “can I speak to\nyou alone for a moment?”\n\nThis request forced the communicative cleric out of the gangway, and\nbefore he could speak in the next room, the girl was talking with\nstrange incisiveness.\n\n“You are a clever man,” she said, “and you are trying to save Patrick,\nI know. But it’s no use. The core of all this is black, and the more\nthings you find out the more there will be against the miserable man I\nlove.”\n\n“Why?” asked Brown, looking at her steadily.\n\n“Because,” she answered equally steadily, “I saw him commit the crime\nmyself.”\n\n“Ah!” said the unmoved Brown, “and what did he do?”\n\n“I was in this room next to them,” she explained; “both doors were\nclosed, but I suddenly heard a voice, such as I had never heard on\nearth, roaring ‘Hell, hell, hell,’ again and again, and then the two\ndoors shook with the first explosion of the revolver. Thrice again the\nthing banged before I got the two doors open and found the room full of\nsmoke; but the pistol was smoking in my poor, mad Patrick’s hand; and I\nsaw him fire the last murderous volley with my own eyes. Then he leapt\non my father, who was clinging in terror to the window-sill, and,\ngrappling, tried to strangle him with the rope, which he threw over his\nhead, but which slipped over his struggling shoulders to his feet. Then\nit tightened round one leg and Patrick dragged him along like a maniac.\nI snatched a knife from the mat, and, rushing between them, managed to\ncut the rope before I fainted.”\n\n“I see,” said Father Brown, with the same wooden civility. “Thank you.”\n\nAs the girl collapsed under her memories, the priest passed stiffly\ninto the next room, where he found Gilder and Merton alone with Patrick\nRoyce, who sat in a chair, handcuffed. There he said to the Inspector\nsubmissively:\n\n“Might I say a word to the prisoner in your presence; and might he take\noff those funny cuffs for a minute?”\n\n“He is a very powerful man,” said Merton in an undertone. “Why do you\nwant them taken off?”\n\n“Why, I thought,” replied the priest humbly, “that perhaps I might have\nthe very great honour of shaking hands with him.”\n\nBoth detectives stared, and Father Brown added: “Won’t you tell them\nabout it, sir?”\n\nThe man on the chair shook his tousled head, and the priest turned\nimpatiently.\n\n“Then I will,” he said. “Private lives are more important than public\nreputations. I am going to save the living, and let the dead bury their\ndead.”\n\nHe went to the fatal window, and blinked out of it as he went on\ntalking.\n\n“I told you that in this case there were too many weapons and only one\ndeath. I tell you now that they were not weapons, and were not used to\ncause death. All those grisly tools, the noose, the bloody knife, the\nexploding pistol, were instruments of a curious mercy. They were not\nused to kill Sir Aaron, but to save him.”\n\n“To save him!” repeated Gilder. “And from what?”\n\n“From himself,” said Father Brown. “He was a suicidal maniac.”\n\n“What?” cried Merton in an incredulous tone. “And the Religion of\nCheerfulness--”\n\n“It is a cruel religion,” said the priest, looking out of the window.\n“Why couldn’t they let him weep a little, like his fathers before him?\nHis plans stiffened, his views grew cold; behind that merry mask was\nthe empty mind of the atheist. At last, to keep up his hilarious public\nlevel, he fell back on that dram-drinking he had abandoned long ago. But\nthere is this horror about alcoholism in a sincere teetotaler: that he\npictures and expects that psychological inferno from which he has warned\nothers. It leapt upon poor Armstrong prematurely, and by this morning\nhe was in such a case that he sat here and cried he was in hell, in so\ncrazy a voice that his daughter did not know it. He was mad for death,\nand with the monkey tricks of the mad he had scattered round him death\nin many shapes--a running noose and his friend’s revolver and a knife.\nRoyce entered accidentally and acted in a flash. He flung the knife\non the mat behind him, snatched up the revolver, and having no time to\nunload it, emptied it shot after shot all over the floor. The suicide\nsaw a fourth shape of death, and made a dash for the window. The rescuer\ndid the only thing he could--ran after him with the rope and tried to\ntie him hand and foot. Then it was that the unlucky girl ran in, and\nmisunderstanding the struggle, strove to slash her father free. At first\nshe only slashed poor Royce’s knuckles, from which has come all the\nlittle blood in this affair. But, of course, you noticed that he left\nblood, but no wound, on that servant’s face? Only before the poor woman\nswooned, she did hack her father loose, so that he went crashing through\nthat window into eternity.”\n\nThere was a long stillness slowly broken by the metallic noises of\nGilder unlocking the handcuffs of Patrick Royce, to whom he said: “I\nthink I should have told the truth, sir. You and the young lady are\nworth more than Armstrong’s obituary notices.”\n\n“Confound Armstrong’s notices,” cried Royce roughly. “Don’t you see it\nwas because she mustn’t know?”\n\n“Mustn’t know what?” asked Merton.\n\n“Why, that she killed her father, you fool!” roared the other. “He’d\nhave been alive now but for her. It might craze her to know that.”\n\n“No, I don’t think it would,” remarked Father Brown, as he picked up his\nhat. “I rather think I should tell her. Even the most murderous blunders\ndon’t poison life like sins; anyhow, I think you may both be the happier\nnow. I’ve got to go back to the Deaf School.”\n\nAs he went out on to the gusty grass an acquaintance from Highgate\nstopped him and said:\n\n“The Coroner has arrived. The inquiry is just going to begin.”\n\n“I’ve got to get back to the Deaf School,” said Father Brown. “I’m sorry\nI can’t stop for the inquiry.”"
