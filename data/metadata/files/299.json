He passed through the\nstraight and narrow gate where he was asked his name, birthplace, and\nhow much money he had,--at which he grew very much frightened.\n\n“And your destination?”--demanded the gruff-looking functionary at the\ndesk.\n\n“America,” said the youth, and touched his hat politely.\n\n“Do you think I have time for joking?” roared the official, with an\noath.\n\nThe Norseman ran his hand through his hair, smiled his timidly\nconciliatory smile, and tried his best to look brave; but his hand\ntrembled and his heart thumped away at an alarmingly quickened tempo.\n\n“Put him down for Nebraska!” cried a stout red-cheeked individual\n(inwrapped in the mingled fumes of tobacco and whisky) whose function it\nwas to open and shut the gate.\n\n“There ain’t many as go to Nebraska.”\n\n“All right, Nebraska.”\n\nThe gate swung open and the pressure from behind urged the timid\ntraveler on, while an extra push from the gate-keeper sent him flying in\nthe direction of a board fence, where he sat down and tried to realize\nthat he was now in the land of liberty.\n\nHalfdan Bjerk was a tall, slender-limbed youth of very delicate frame;\nhe had a pair of wonderfully candid, unreflecting blue eyes, a smooth,\nclear, beardless face, and soft, wavy light hair, which was pushed back\nfrom his forehead without parting. His mouth and chin were well cut, but\ntheir lines were, perhaps, rather weak for a man. When in repose, the\nensemble of his features was exceedingly pleasing and somehow reminded\none of Correggio’s St. John. He had left his native land because he was\nan ardent republican and was abstractly convinced that man, generically\nand individually, lives more happily in a republic than in a monarchy.\nHe had anticipated with keen pleasure the large, freely breathing life\nhe was to lead in a land where every man was his neighbor’s brother,\nwhere no senseless traditions kept a jealous watch over obsolete\nsystems and shrines, and no chilling prejudice blighted the spontaneous\nblossoming of the soul.\n\nHalfdan was an only child. His father, a poor government official, had\ndied during his infancy, and his mother had given music lessons, and\nkept boarders, in order to gain the means to give her son what is\ncalled a learned education. In the Latin school Halfdan had enjoyed the\nreputation of being a bright youth, and at the age of eighteen, he had\nentered the university under the most promising auspices. He could make\nvery fair verses, and play all imaginable instruments with equal ease,\nwhich made him a favorite in society. Moreover, he possessed that very\nold-fashioned accomplishment of cutting silhouettes; and what was more,\nhe could draw the most charmingly fantastic arabesques for embroidery\npatterns, and he even dabbled in portrait and landscape painting.\nWhatever he turned his hand to, he did well, in fact, astonishingly\nwell for a dilettante, and yet not well enough to claim the title of an\nartist. Nor did it ever occur to him to make such a claim. As one of\nhis fellow-students remarked in a fit of jealousy, “Once when Nature had\nmade three geniuses, a poet, a musician, and a painter, she took all the\nremaining odds and ends and shook them together at random and the result\nwas Halfdan Bjerk.” This agreeable melange of accomplishments, however,\nproved very attractive to the ladies, who invited the possessor to\ninnumerable afternoon tea-parties, where they drew heavy drafts on his\nunflagging patience, and kept him steadily engaged with patterns and\ndesigns for embroidery, leather flowers, and other dainty knickknacks.\nAnd in return for all his exertions they called him “sweet” and\n“beautiful,” and applied to him many other enthusiastic adjectives\nseldom heard in connection with masculine names. In the university,\ntalents of this order gained but slight recognition, and when Halfdan\nhad for three years been preparing himself in vain for the examen\nphilosophicum, he found himself slowly and imperceptibly drifting into\nthe ranks of the so-called studiosi perpetui, who preserve a solemn\nsilence at the examination tables, fraternize with every new generation\nof freshmen, and at last become part of the fixed furniture of their\nAlma Mater. In the larger American colleges, such men are mercilessly\ndropped or sent to a Divinity School; but the European universities,\nwhose tempers the centuries have mellowed, harbor in their spacious\nGothic bosoms a tenderer heart for their unfortunate sons. There the\nprofessors greet them at the green tables with a good-humored smile of\nrecognition; they are treated with gentle forbearance, and are allowed\nto linger on, until they die or become tutors in the families of remote\nclergymen, where they invariably fall in love with the handsomest\ndaughter, and thus lounge into a modest prosperity.\n\nIf this had been the fate of our friend Bjerk, we should have dismissed\nhim here with a confident “vale” on his life’s pilgrimage. But,\nunfortunately, Bjerk was inclined to hold the government in some\nway responsible for his own poor success as a student, and this, in\nconnection with an aesthetic enthusiasm for ancient Greece, gradually\nconvinced him that the republic was the only form of government under\nwhich men of his tastes and temperament were apt to flourish. It was,\nlike everything that pertained to him, a cheerful, genial conviction,\nwithout the slightest tinge of bitterness. The old institutions were\nobsolete, rotten to the core, he said, and needed a radical renovation.\nHe could sit for hours of an evening in the Students’ Union, and\ndiscourse over a glass of mild toddy, on the benefits of universal\nsuffrage and trial by jury, while the picturesqueness of his language,\nhis genial sarcasms, or occasional witty allusions would call forth\nuproarious applause from throngs of admiring freshmen. These were the\nsunny days in Halfdan’s career, days long to be remembered. They came to\nan abrupt end when old Mrs. Bjerk died, leaving nothing behind her but\nher furniture and some trifling debts. The son, who was not an eminently\npractical man, underwent long hours of misery in trying to settle up her\naffairs, and finally in a moment of extreme dejection sold his entire\ninheritance in a lump to a pawnbroker (reserving for himself a few rings\nand trinkets) for the modest sum of 250 dollars specie. He then took\nformal leave of the Students’ Union in a brilliant speech, in which\nhe traced the parallelisms between the lives of Pericles and\nWashington,--in his opinion the two greatest men the world had ever\nseen,--expounded his theory of democratic government, and explained the\ncauses of the rapid rise of the American Republic. The next morning he\nexchanged half of his worldly possessions for a ticket to New York, and\nwithin a few days set sail for the land of promise, in the far West.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nFrom Castle Garden, Halfdan made his way up through Greenwich street,\npursued by a clamorous troop of confidence men and hotel runners.\n\n“Kommen Sie mit mir. Ich bin auch Deutsch,” cried one. “Voila, voila,\nje parle Francais,” shouted another, seizing hold of his valise. “Jeg\ner Dansk. Tale Dansk,” [1] roared a third, with an accent which seriously\nimpeached his truthfulness. In order to escape from these importunate\nrascals, who were every moment getting bolder, he threw himself into the\nfirst street-car which happened to pass; he sat down, gazed out of the\nwindows and soon became so thoroughly absorbed in the animated scenes\nwhich moved as in a panorama before his eyes, that he quite forgot where\nhe was going. The conductor called for fares, and received an English\nshilling, which, after some ineffectual expostulation, he pocketed, but\ngave no change. At last after about an hour’s journey, the car stopped,\nthe conductor called out “Central Park,” and Halfdan woke up with\na start. He dismounted with a timid, deliberate step, stared in dim\nbewilderment at the long rows of palatial residences, and a chill sense\nof loneliness crept over him. The hopeless strangeness of everything\nhe saw, instead of filling him with rapture as he had once anticipated,\nSent a cold shiver to his heart. It is a very large affair, this world\nof ours--a good deal larger than it appeared to him gazing out upon\nit from his snug little corner up under the Pole; and it was as\nunsympathetic as it was large; he suddenly felt what he had never been\naware of before--that he was a very small part of it and of very little\naccount after all. He staggered over to a bench at the entrance to the\npark, and sat long watching the fine carriages as they dashed past him;\nhe saw the handsome women in brilliant costumes laughing and chatting\ngayly; the apathetic policemen promenading in stoic dignity up and down\nupon the smooth pavements; the jauntily attired nurses, whom in his\nNorse innocence he took for mothers or aunts of the children, wheeling\nbaby-carriages which to Norse eyes seemed miracles of dainty ingenuity,\nunder the shady crowns of the elm-trees. He did not know how long he\nhad been sitting there, when a little bright-eyed girl with light kid\ngloves, a small blue parasol and a blue polonaise, quite a lady of\nfashion en miniature, stopped in front of him and stared at him in shy\nwonder. He had always been fond of children, and often rejoiced in their\naffectionate ways and confidential prattle, and now it suddenly touched\nhim with a warm sense of human fellowship to have this little daintily\nbefrilled and crisply starched beauty single him out for notice among\nthe hundreds who reclined in the arbors, or sauntered to and fro under\nthe great trees.\n\n“What is your name, my little girl?” he asked, in a tone of friendly\ninterest.\n\n“Clara,” answered the child, hesitatingly; then, having by another look\nassured herself of his harmlessness, she added: “How very funny you\nspeak!”\n\n“Yes,” he said, stooping down to take he tiny begloved hand. “I do not\nspeak as well as you do, yet; but I shall soon learn.”\n\nClara looked puzzled.\n\n“How old are you?” she asked, raising her parasol, and throwing back her\nhead with an air of superiority.\n\n“I am twenty-four years old.”\n\nShe began to count half aloud on her fingers: “One, two, three, four,”\n but, before she reached twenty, she lost her patience.\n\n“Twenty-four,” she exclaimed, “that is a great deal. I am only seven,\nand papa gave me a pony on my birthday. Have you got a pony?”\n\n“No; I have nothing but what is in this valise, and you know I could not\nvery well get a pony into it.”\n\nClara glanced curiously at the valise and laughed; then suddenly she\ngrew serious again, put her hand into her pocket and seemed to be\nsearching eagerly for something. Presently she hauled out a small\nporcelain doll’s head, then a red-painted block with letters on it, and\nat last a penny.\n\n“Do you want them?” she said, reaching him her treasures in both hands.\n“You may have them all.”\n\nBefore he had time to answer, a shrill, penetrating voice cried out:\n\n“Why, gracious! child, what are you doing?”\n\nAnd the nurse, who had been deeply absorbed in “The New York Ledger,”\n came rushing up, snatched the child away, and retreated as hastily as\nshe had come.\n\nHalfdan rose and wandered for hours aimlessly along the intertwining\nroads and footpaths. He visited the menageries, admired the statues,\ntook a very light dinner, consisting of coffee, sandwiches, and ice, at\nthe Chinese Pavilion, and, toward evening, discovered an inviting leafy\narbor, where he could withdraw into the privacy of his own thoughts,\nand ponder upon the still unsolved problem of his destiny. The little\nincident with the child had taken the edge off his unhappiness and\nturned him into a more conciliatory mood toward himself and the great\npitiless world, which seemed to take so little notice of him. And he,\nwho had come here with so warm a heart and so ardent a will to join\nin the great work of human advancement--to find himself thus harshly\nignored and buffeted about, as if he were a hostile intruder! Before\nhim lay the huge unknown city where human life pulsated with large,\nfull heart-throbs, where a breathless, weird intensity, a cold, fierce\npassion seemed to be hurrying everything onward in a maddening whirl,\nwhere a gentle, warm-blooded enthusiast like himself had no place and\ncould expect naught but a speedy destruction. A strange, unconquerable\ndread took possession of him, as if he had been caught in a swift,\nstrong whirlpool, from which he vainly struggled to escape. He crouched\ndown among the foliage and shuddered. He could not return to the city.\nNo, no: he never would return. He would remain here hidden and unseen\nuntil morning, and then he would seek a vessel bound for his dear native\nland, where the great mountains loomed up in serene majesty toward the\nblue sky, where the pine-forests whispered their dreamily sympathetic\nlegends, in the long summer twilights, where human existence flowed\non in calm beauty with the modest aims, small virtues, and small vices\nwhich were the happiness of modest, idyllic souls. He even saw himself\nin spirit recounting to his astonished countrymen the wonderful things\nhe had heard and seen during his foreign pilgrimage, and smiled to\nhimself as he imagined their wonder when he should tell them about the\nbeautiful little girl who had been the first and only one to offer him a\nfriendly greeting in the strange land. During these reflections he fell\nasleep, and slept soundly for two or three hours. Once, he seemed to\nhear footsteps and whispers among the trees, and made an effort to rouse\nhimself, but weariness again overmastered him and he slept on. At last,\nhe felt himself seized violently by the shoulders, and a gruff voice\nshouted in his ear:\n\n“Get up, you sleepy dog.”\n\nHe rubbed his eyes, and, by the dim light of the moon, saw a Herculean\npoliceman lifting a stout stick over his head. His former terror came\nupon him with increased violence, and his heart stood for a moment\nstill, then, again, hammered away as if it would burst his sides.\n\n“Come along!” roared the policeman, shaking him vehemently by the collar\nof his coat.\n\nIn his bewilderment he quite forgot where he was, and, in hurried\nNorse sentences, assured his persecutor that he was a harmless, honest\ntraveler, and implored him to release him. But the official Hercules was\ninexorable.\n\n“My valise, my valise;” cried Halfdan. “Pray let me get my valise.”\n\nThey returned to the place where he had slept, but the valise was\nnowhere to be found. Then, with dumb despair he resigned himself to his\nfate, and after a brief ride on a street-car, found himself standing in\na large, low-ceiled room; he covered his face with his hands and burst\ninto tears.\n\n“The grand-the happy republic,” he murmured, “spontaneous blossoming of\nthe soul. Alas! I have rooted up my life; I fear it will never blossom.”\n\nAll the high-flown adjectives he had employed in his parting speech in\nthe Students’ Union, when he paid his enthusiastic tribute to the Grand\nRepublic, now kept recurring to him, and in this moment the paradox\nseemed cruel. The Grand Republic, what did it care for such as he? A\npair of brawny arms fit to wield the pick-axe and to steer the plow it\nreceived with an eager welcome; for a child-like, loving heart and a\ngenerously fantastic brain, it had but the stern greeting of the law.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe next morning, Halfdan was released from the Police Station, having\nfirst been fined five dollars for vagrancy. All his money, with the\nexception of a few pounds which he had exchanged in Liverpool, he\nhad lost with his valise, and he had to his knowledge not a single\nacquaintance in the city or on the whole continent. In order to increase\nhis capital he bought some fifty “Tribunes,” but, as it was already\nlate in the day, he hardly succeeded in selling a single copy. The next\nmorning, he once more stationed himself on the corner of Murray street\nand Broadway, hoping in his innocence to dispose of the papers he\nhad still on hand from the previous day, and actually did find a few\ncustomers among the people who were jumping in and out of the omnibuses\nthat passed up and down the great thoroughfare. To his surprise,\nhowever, one of these gentlemen returned to him with a very wrathful\ncountenance, shook his fist at him, and vociferated with excited\ngestures something which to Halfdan’s ears had a very unintelligible\nsound. He made a vain effort to defend himself; the situation appeared\nso utterly incomprehensible to him, and in his dumb helplessness he\nlooked pitiful enough to move the heart of a stone. No English phrase\nsuggested itself to him, only a few Norse interjections rose to his\nlips. The man’s anger suddenly abated; he picked up the paper which\nhe had thrown on the sidewalk, and stood for a while regarding Halfdan\ncuriously.\n\n“Are you a Norwegian?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, I came from Norway yesterday.”\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“Halfdan Bjerk.”\n\n“Halfdan Bjerk! My stars! Who would have thought of meeting you here!\nYou do not recognize me, I suppose.”\n\nHalfdan declared with a timid tremor in his voice that he could not at\nthe moment recall his features.\n\n“No, I imagine I must have changed a good deal since you saw me,” said\nthe man, suddenly dropping into Norwegian. “I am Gustav Olson, I used to\nlive in the same house with you once, but that is long ago now.”\n\nGustav Olson--to be sure, he was the porter’s son in the house,\nwhere his mother had once during his childhood, taken a flat. He well\nremembered having clandestinely traded jack-knives and buttons with him,\nin spite of the frequent warnings he had received to have nothing to\ndo with him; for Gustav, with his broad freckled face and red hair, was\nlooked upon by the genteel inhabitants of the upper flats as rather a\ndisreputable character. He had once whipped the son of a colonel who\nhad been impudent to him, and thrown a snow-ball at the head of a\nnew-fledged lieutenant, which offenses he had duly expiated at a house\nof correction. Since that time he had vanished from Halfdan’s horizon.\nHe had still the same broad freckled face, now covered with a lusty\ngrowth of coarse red beard, the same rebellious head of hair, which\nrefused to yield to the subduing influences of the comb, the same\nplebeian hands and feet, and uncouth clumsiness of form. But his linen\nwas irreproachable, and a certain dash in his manner, and the\nloud fashionableness of his attire, gave unmistakable evidences of\nprosperity.\n\n“Come, Bjerk,” said he in a tone of good-fellowship, which was not\nwithout its sting to the idealistic republican, “you must take up a\nbetter business than selling yesterday’s `Tribune.’ That won’t pay here,\nyou know. Come along to our office and I will see if something can’t be\ndone for you.”\n\n“But I should be sorry to give you trouble,” stammered Halfdan, whose\nnative pride, even in his present wretchedness, protested against\naccepting a favor from one whom he had been wont to regard as his\ninferior.\n\n“Nonsense, my boy. Hurry up, I haven’t much time to spare. The office\nis only two blocks from here. You don’t look as if you could afford to\nthrow away a friendly offer.”\n\nThe last words suddenly roused Halfdan from his apathy; for he felt\nthat they were true. A drowning man cannot afford to make nice\ndistinctions--cannot afford to ask whether the helping hand that is\nextended to him be that of an equal or an inferior. So he swallowed\nhis humiliation and threaded his way through the bewildering turmoil of\nBroadway, by the side of his officious friend.\n\nThey entered a large, elegantly furnished office, where clerks with\nsleek and severely apathetic countenances stood scribbling at their\ndesks.\n\n“You will have to amuse yourself as best you can,” said Olson. “Mr. Van\nKirk will be here in twenty minutes. I haven’t time to entertain you.”\n\nA dreary half hour passed. Then the door opened and a tall, handsome\nman, with a full grayish beard, and a commanding presence, entered and\ntook his seat at a desk in a smaller adjoining office. He opened, with\ngreat dispatch, a pile of letters which lay on the desk before him,\ncalled out in a sharp, ringing tone for a clerk, who promptly appeared,\nhanded him half-a-dozen letters, accompanying each with a brief\ndirection, took some clean paper from a drawer and fell to writing.\nThere was something brisk, determined, and business-like in his manner,\nwhich made it seem very hopeless to Halfdan to appear before him as a\npetitioner. Presently Olson entered the private office, closing the door\nbehind him, and a few minutes later re-appeared and summoned Halfdan\ninto the chief’s presence.\n\n“You are a Norwegian, I hear,” said the merchant, looking around over\nhis shoulder at the supplicant, with a preoccupied air. “You want work.\nWhat can you do?”\n\nWhat can you do? A fatal question. But here was clearly no opportunity\nfor mental debate. So, summoning all his courage, but feeling\nnevertheless very faint, he answered:\n\n“I have passed both examen artium and philosophicum, [2] and got my laud\nclear in the former, but in the latter haud on the first point.”\n\nMr. Van Kirk wheeled round on his chair and faced the speaker:\n\n“That is all Greek to me,” he said, in a severe tone. “Can you keep\naccounts?”\n\n“No. I am afraid not.”\n\nKeeping accounts was not deemed a classical accomplishment in Norway. It\nwas only “trade-rats” who troubled themselves about such gross things,\nand if our Norseman had not been too absorbed with the problem of his\ndestiny, he would have been justly indignant at having such a question\nput to him.\n\n“Then you don’t know book-keeping?”\n\n“I think not. I never tried it.”\n\n“Then you may be sure you don’t know it. But you must certainly have\ntried your hand at something. Is there nothing you can think of which\nmight help you to get a living?”\n\n“I can play the piano--and--and the violin.”\n\n“Very well, then. You may come this afternoon to my house. Mr. Olson\nwill tell you the address. I will give you a note to Mrs. Van Kirk.\nPerhaps she will engage you as a music teacher for the children. Good\nmorning.”\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nAt half-past four o’clock in the afternoon, Halfdan found himself\nstanding in a large, dimly lighted drawing-room, whose brilliant\nupholstery, luxurious carpets, and fantastically twisted furniture\ndazzled and bewildered his senses. All was so strange, so strange;\nnowhere a familiar object to give rest to the wearied eye. Wherever he\nlooked he saw his shabbily attired figure repeated in the long crystal\nmirrors, and he became uncomfortably conscious of his threadbare coat,\nhis uncouth boots, and the general incongruity of his appearance. With\nevery moment his uneasiness grew; and he was vaguely considering the\npropriety of a precipitate flight, when the rustle of a dress at the\nfarther end of the room startled him, and a small, plump lady, of a\ndaintily exquisite form, swept up toward him, gave a slight inclination\nof her head, and sank down into an easy-chair:\n\n“You are Mr. ----, the Norwegian, who wishes to give music lessons?”\n she said, holding a pair of gold-framed eyeglasses up to her eyes, and\nrunning over the note which she held in her hand. It read as follows:\n\n\nDEAR MARTHA,--The bearer of this note is a young Norwegian, I forgot to\nascertain his name, a friend of Olson’s. He wishes to teach music.\nIf you can help the poor devil and give him something to do, you will\noblige,               Yours,              H. V. K.\n\n\nMrs. Van Kirk was evidently, by at least twelve years, her husband’s\njunior, and apparently not very far advanced in the forties. Her blonde\nhair, which was freshly crimped, fell lightly over her smooth, narrow\nforehead; her nose, mouth and chin had a neat distinctness of outline;\nher complexion was either naturally or artificially perfect, and\nher eyes, which were of the purest blue, had, owing to their\nnear-sightedness, a certain pinched and scrutinizing look. This look,\nwhich was without the slightest touch of severity, indicating merely\na lively degree of interest, was further emphasized by three small\nperpendicular wrinkles, which deepened and again relaxed according to\nthe varying intensity of observation she bestowed upon the object which\nfor the time engaged her attention.\n\n“Your name, if you please?” said Mrs. Van Kirk, having for awhile\nmeasured her visitor with a glance of mild scrutiny.\n\n“Halfdan Bjerk.”\n\n“Half-dan B----, how do you spell that?”\n\n“B-j-e-r-k.”\n\n“B-jerk. Well, but I mean, what is your name in English?”\n\nHalfdan looked blank, and blushed to his ears.\n\n“I wish to know,” continued the lady energetically, evidently anxious\nto help him out, “what your name would mean in plain English. Bjerk, it\ncertainly must mean something.”\n\n“Bjerk is a tree--a birch-tree.”\n\n“Very well, Birch,--that is a very respectable name. And your first\nname? What did you say that was?\n\n“H-a-l-f-d-a-n.”\n\n“Half Dan. Why not a whole Dan and be done with it? Dan Birch, or rather\nDaniel Birch. Indeed, that sounds quite Christian.”\n\n“As you please, madam,” faltered the victim, looking very unhappy.\n\n“You will pardon my straightforwardness, won’t you? B-jerk. I could\nnever pronounce that, you know.”\n\n“Whatever may be agreeable to you, madam, will be sure to please me.”\n\n“That is very well said. And you will find that it always pays to try to\nplease me. And you wish to teach music? If you have no objection I will\ncall my oldest daughter. She is an excellent judge of music, and if\nyour playing meets with her approval, I will engage you, as my husband\nsuggests, not to teach Edith, you understand, but my youngest child,\nClara.”\n\nHalfdan bowed assent, and Mrs. Van Kirk rustled out into the hall where\nshe rang a bell, and re-entered. A servant in dress-coat appeared, and\nagain vanished as noiselessly as he had come. To our Norseman there was\nsome thing weird and uncanny about these silent entrances and exits;\nhe could hardly suppress a shudder. He had been accustomed to hear the\nclatter of people’s heels upon the bare floors, as they approached, and\nthe audible crescendo of their footsteps gave one warning, and prevented\none from being taken by surprise. While absorbed in these reflections,\nhis senses must have been dormant; for just then Miss Edith Van Kirk\nentered, unheralded by anything but a hovering perfume, the effect of\nwhich was to lull him still deeper into his wondering abstraction.\n\n“Mr. Birch,” said Mrs. Van Kirk, “this is my daughter Miss Edith,” and\nas Halfdan sprang to his feet and bowed with visible embarrassment, she\ncontinued:\n\n“Edith, this is Mr. Daniel Birch, whom your father has sent here to know\nif he would be serviceable as a music teacher for Clara. And now, dear,\nyou will have to decide about the merits of Mr. Birch. I don’t know\nenough about music to be anything of a judge.”\n\n“If Mr. Birch will be kind enough to play,” said Miss Edith with a\nlanguidly musical intonation,” I shall be happy to listen to him.”\n\nHalfdan silently signified his willingness and followed the ladies to a\nsmaller apartment which was separated from the drawing-room by folding\ndoors. The apparition of the beautiful young girl who was walking at\nhis side had suddenly filled him with a strange burning and shuddering\nhappiness; he could not tear his eyes away from her; she held him as\nby a powerful spell. And still, all the while he had a painful\nsub-consciousness of his own unfortunate appearance, which was thrown\ninto cruel relief by her splendor. The tall, lithe magnificence of her\nform, the airy elegance of her toilet, which seemed the perfection of\nself-concealing art, the elastic deliberateness of her step--all wrought\nlike a gentle, deliciously soothing opiate upon the Norseman’s fancy and\nlifted him into hitherto unknown regions of mingled misery and bliss.\nShe seemed a combination of the most divine contradictions, one moment\nsupremely conscious, and in the next adorably child-like and simple, now\nfull of arts and coquettish innuendoes, then again naïve, unthinking\nand almost boyishly blunt and direct; in a word, one of those miraculous\nNew York girls whom abstractly one may disapprove of, but in the\nconcrete must abjectly adore. This easy predominance of the masculine\nheart over the masculine reason in the presence of an impressive woman,\nhas been the motif of a thousand tragedies in times past, and will\ninspire a thousand more in times to come.\n\nHalfdan sat down at the grand piano and played Chopin’s Nocturne in G\nmajor, flinging out that elaborate filigree of sound with an impetuosity\nand superb ABANDON which caused the ladies to exchange astonished\nglances behind his back. The transitions from the light and ethereal\ntexture of melody to the simple, more concrete theme, which he rendered\nwith delicate shadings of articulation, were sufficiently startling to\nimpress even a less cultivated ear than that of Edith Van Kirk, who had,\nindeed, exhausted whatever musical resources New York has to offer. And\nshe was most profoundly impressed. As he glided over the last pianissimo\nnotes toward the two concluding chords (an ending so characteristic\nof Chopin) she rose and hurried to his side with a heedless eagerness,\nwhich was more eloquent than emphatic words of praise.\n\n“Won’t you please repeat this passage?” she said, humming the air with\nsoft modulations; “I have always regarded the monotonous repetition of\nthis strain” (and she indicated it lightly by a few touches of the keys)\n“as rather a blemish of an otherwise perfect composition. But as you\nplay it, it is anything but monotonous. You put into this single phrase\na more intense meaning and a greater variety of thought than I ever\nsuspected it was capable of expressing.”\n\n“It is my favorite composition,” answered he, modestly. “I have bestowed\nmore thought upon it than upon anything I have ever played, unless\nperhaps it be the one in G minor, which, with all its difference of mood\nand phraseology, expresses an essentially kindred thought.”\n\n“My dear Mr. Birch,” exclaimed Mrs. Van Kirk, whom his skillful\nemployment of technical terms (in spite of his indifferent accent)\nhad impressed even more than his rendering of the music,--“you are a\ncomsummate{sic} artist, and we shall deem it a great privilege if\nyou will undertake to instruct our child. I have listened to you with\nprofound satisfaction.”\n\nHalfdan acknowledged the compliment by a bow and a blush, and repeated\nthe latter part of the nocturne according to Edith’s request.\n\n“And now,” resumed Edith, “may I trouble you to play the G minor, which\nhas even puzzled me more than the one you have just played.”\n\n“It ought really to have been played first,” replied Halfdan. “It is\nfar intenser in its coloring and has a more passionate ring, but its\nconclusion does not seem to be final. There is no rest in it, and it\nseems oddly enough to be a mere transition into the major, which is its\nproper supplement and completes the fragmentary thought.”\n\nMother and daughter once more telegraphed wondering looks at each\nother, while Halfdan plunged into the impetuous movements of the minor\nnocturne, which he played to the end with ever-increasing fervor and\nanimation.\n\n“Mr. Birch,” said Edith, as he arose from the piano with a flushed face,\nand the agitation of the music still tingling through his nerves. “You\nare a far greater musician than you seem to be aware of. I have not\nbeen taking lessons for some time, but you have aroused all my musical\nambition, and if you will accept me too, as a pupil, I shall deem it a\nfavor.”\n\n“I hardly know if I can teach you anything,” answered he, while his\neyes dwelt with keen delight on her beautiful form. “But in my present\nposition I can hardly afford to decline so flattering an offer.”\n\n“You mean to say that you would decline it if you were in a position to\ndo so,” said she, smiling.\n\n“No, only that I should question my convenience more closely.”\n\n“Ah, never mind. I take all the responsibility. I shall cheerfully\nconsent to being imposed upon by you.”\n\nMrs. Van Kirk in the mean while had been examining the contents of a\nfragrant Russia-leather pocket-book, and she now drew out two crisp\nten-dollar notes, and held them out toward him.\n\n“I prefer to make sure of you by paying you in advance,” said she, with\na cheerfully familiar nod, and a critical glance at his attire, the\nmeaning of which he did not fail to detect. “Somebody else might make\nthe same discovery that we have made to-day, and outbid us. And we do\nnot want to be cheated out of our good fortune in having been the first\nto secure so valuable a prize.”\n\n“You need have no fear on that score, madam,” retorted Halfdan, with a\nvivid blush, and purposely misinterpreting the polite subterfuge. “You\nmay rely upon my promise. I shall be here again, as soon as you wish me\nto return.”\n\n“Then, if you please, we shall look for you to-morrow morning at ten\no’clock.”\n\nAnd Mrs. Van Kirk hesitatingly folded up her notes and replaced them in\nher pocket-book.\n\nTo our idealist there was something extremely odious in this sudden\noffer of money. It was the first time any one had offered to pay him,\nand it seemed to put him on a level with a common day-laborer. His first\nimpulse was to resent it as a gratuitous humiliation, but a glance\nat Mrs. Van Kirk’s countenance, which was all aglow with officious\nbenevolence, re-assured him, and his indignation died away.\n\nThat same afternoon Olson, having been informed of his friend’s good\nfortune, volunteered a loan of a hundred dollars, and accompanied him to\na fashionable tailor, where he underwent a pleasing metamorphosis.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nIn Norway the ladies dress with the innocent purpose of protecting\nthemselves against the weather; if this purpose is still remotely\npresent in the toilets of American women of to-day, it is, at all\nevents, sufficiently disguised to challenge detection, very much like a\nprimitive Sanscrit root in its French and English derivatives. This was\nthe reflection which was uppermost in Halfdan’s mind as Edith, ravishing\nto behold in the airy grace of her fragrant morning toilet, at the\nappointed time took her seat at his side before the piano. Her presence\nseemed so intense, so all-absorbing, that it left no thought for\nthe music. A woman, with all the spiritual mysteries which that name\nimplies, had always appeared to him rather a composite phenomenon,\neven apart from those varied accessories of dress, in which as by an\ninevitable analogy, she sees fit to express the inner multiformity of\nher being. Nevertheless, this former conception of his, when compared\nto that wonderful complexity of ethereal lines, colors, tints and\nhalf-tints which go to make up the modern New York girl, seemed\ninexpressibly simple, almost what plain arithmetic must appear to a man\nwho has mastered calculus.\n\nEdith had opened one of those small red-covered volumes of Chopin where\nthe rich, wondrous melodies lie peacefully folded up like strange exotic\nflowers in an herbarium. She began to play the fantasia impromtu, which\nought to be dashed off at a single “heat,” whose passionate impulse\nhurries it on breathlessly toward its abrupt finale. But Edith toiled\nconsiderably with her fingering, and blurred the keen edges of each\nswift phrase by her indistinct articulation. And still there was a\nsufficiently ardent intention in her play to save it from being a\nfailure. She made a gesture of disgust when she had finished, shut the\nbook, and let her hands drop crosswise in her lap.\n\n“I only wanted to give you a proof of my incapacity,” she said, turning\nher large luminous gaze upon her instructor, “in order to make you duly\nappreciate what you have undertaken. Now, tell me truly and honestly,\nare you not discouraged?”\n\n“Not by any means,” replied he, while the rapture of her presence\nrippled through his nerves, “you have fire enough in you to make an\nadmirable musician. But your fingers, as yet, refuse to carry out your\nfine intentions. They only need discipline.”\n\n“And do you suppose you can discipline them? They are a fearfully\nobstinate set, and cause me infinite mortification.”\n\n“Would you allow me to look at your hand?”\n\nShe raised her right hand, and with a sort of impulsive heedlessness let\nit drop into his. An exclamation of surprise escaped him.\n\n“If you will pardon me,” he said, “it is a superb hand--a hand capable\nof performing miracles--musical miracles I mean. Only look here”--(and\nhe drew the fore and second fingers apart)--“so firmly set in the joint\nand still so flexible. I doubt if Liszt himself can boast a finer row of\nfingers. Your hands will surely not prevent you from becoming a second\nVon Bulow, which to my mind means a good deal more than a second Liszt.”\n\n“Thank you, that is quite enough,” she exclaimed, with an incredulous\nlaugh; “you have done bravely. That at all events throws the whole\nburden of responsibility upon myself, if I do not become a second\nsomebody. I shall be perfectly satisfied, however, if you can only make\nme as good a musician as you are yourself, so that I can render a not\ntoo difficult piece without feeling all the while that I am committing\nsacrilege in mutilating the fine thoughts of some great composer.”\n\n“You are too modest; you do not--”\n\n“No, no, I am not modest,” she interrupted him with an impetuosity which\nstartled him. “I beg of you not to persist in paying me compliments. I\nget too much of that cheap article elsewhere. I hate to be told that\nI am better than I know I am. If you are to do me any good by your\ninstruction, you must be perfectly sincere toward me, and tell me\nplainly of my short-comings. I promise you beforehand that I shall never\nbe offended. There is my hand. Now, is it a bargain?”\n\nHis fingers closed involuntarily over the soft beautiful hand, and once\nmore the luxury of her touch sent a thrill of delight through him.\n\n“I have not been insincere,” he murmured, “but I shall be on my guard in\nfuture, even against the appearance of insincerity.”\n\n“And when I play detestably, you will say so, and not smooth it over\nwith unmeaning flatteries?”\n\n“I will try.”\n\n“Very well, then we shall get on well together. Do not imagine that this\nis a mere feminine whim of mine. I never was more in earnest. Men, and\nI believe foreigners, to a greater degree than Americans, have the idea\nthat women must be treated with gentle forbearance; that their follies,\nif they are foolish, must be glossed over with some polite name. They\nexert themselves to the utmost to make us mere playthings, and, as such,\ncontemptible both in our own eyes and in theirs. No sincere respect can\nexist where the truth has to be avoided. But the majority of American\nwomen are made of too stern a stuff to be dealt with in that way. They\nfeel the lurking insincerity even where politeness forbids them to\nshow it, and it makes them disgusted both with themselves, and with the\nflatterer. And now you must pardon me for having spoken so plainly to\nyou on so short an acquaintance; but you are a foreigner, and it may be\nan act of friendship to initiate you as soon as possible into our ways\nand customs.”\n\nHe hardly knew what to answer. Her vehemence was so sudden, and\nthe sentiments she had uttered so different from those which he had\nhabitually ascribed to women, that he could only sit and gaze at her\nin mute astonishment. He could not but admit that in the main she had\njudged him rightly, and that his own attitude and that of other men\ntoward her sex, were based upon an implied assumption of superiority.\n\n“I am afraid I have shocked you,” she resumed, noticing the startled\nexpression of his countenance. “But really it was quite inevitable,\nif we were at all to understand each other. You will forgive me, won’t\nyou?”\n\n“Forgive!” stammered he, “I have nothing to forgive. It was only your\nmerciless truthfulness which startled me. I rather owe you thanks,\nif you will allow me to be grateful to you. It seems an enviable\nprivilege.”\n\n“Now,” interrupted Edith, raising her forefinger in playful threat,\n“remember your promise.”\n\nThe lesson was now continued without further interruption. When it was\nfinished, a little girl, with her hair done up in curl-papers, and\na very stiffly starched dress, which stood out on all sides almost\nhorizontally, entered, accompanied by Mrs. Van Kirk. Halfdan immediately\nrecognized his acquaintance from the park, and it appeared to him a\ngood omen that this child, whose friendly interest in him had warmed his\nheart in a moment when his fortunes seemed so desperate, should\ncontinue to be associated with his life on this new continent. Clara was\nevidently greatly impressed by the change in his appearance, and could\nwith difficulty be restrained from commenting upon it.\n\nShe proved a very apt scholar in music, and enjoyed the lessons the more\nfor her cordial liking of her teacher.\n\nIt will be necessary henceforth to omit the less significant details in\nthe career of our friend “Mr. Birch.” Before a month was past, he had\nfirmly established himself in the favor of the different members of the\nVan Kirk family. Mrs. Van Kirk spoke of him to her lady visitors as “a\nperfect jewel,” frequently leaving them in doubt as to whether he was a\ncook or a coachman. Edith apostrophized him to her fashionable friends\nas “a real genius,” leaving a dim impression upon their minds of flowing\nlocks, a shiny velvet jacket, slouched hat, defiant neck-tie and a\ngeneral air of disreputable pretentiousness. Geniuses of the foreign\ntype were never, in the estimation of fashionable New York society, what\nyou would call “exactly nice,” and against prejudices of this order\nno amount of argument will ever prevail. Clara, who had by this time\ndiscovered that her teacher possessed an inexhaustible fund of fairy\nstories, assured her playmates across the street that he was “just\nsplendid,” and frequently invited them over to listen to his wonderful\ntales. Mr. Van Kirk himself, of course, was non-committal, but paid the\nbills unmurmuringly.\n\nHalfdan in the meanwhile was vainly struggling against his growing\npassion for Edith; but the more he rebelled the more hopelessly he found\nhimself entangled in its inextricable net. The fly, as long as it keeps\nquiet in the spider’s web, may for a moment forget its situation; but\nthe least effort to escape is apt to frustrate itself and again reveal\nthe imminent peril. Thus he too “kicked against the pricks,” hoped,\nfeared, rebelled against his destiny, and again, from sheer weariness,\nrelapsed into a dull, benumbed apathy. In spite of her friendly\nsympathy, he never felt so keenly his alienism as in her presence. She\naccepted the spontaneous homage he paid her, sometimes with impatience,\nas something that was really beneath her notice; at other times she\nfrankly recognized it, bantered him with his “Old World chivalry,” which\nwould soon evaporate in the practical American atmosphere, and called\nhim her Viking, her knight and her faithful squire. But it never\noccurred to her to regard his devotion in a serious light, and to look\nupon him as a possible lover had evidently never entered her head. As\ntheir intercourse grew more intimate, he had volunteered to read his\nfavorite poets with her, and had gradually succeeded in imparting to her\nsomething of his own passionate liking for Heine and Björnson. She\nhad in return called his attention to the works of American authors\nwho had hitherto been little more than names to him, and they had thus\nmanaged to be of mutual benefit to each other, and to spend many a\npleasant hour during the long winter afternoons in each other’s company.\nBut Edith had a very keen sense of humor, and could hardly restrain her\nsecret amusement when she heard him reading Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life”\n and Poe’s “Raven” (which had been familiar to her from her babyhood),\noften with false accent, but always with intense enthusiasm. The\nreflection that he had had no part of his life in common with her,--that\nhe did not love the things which she loved,--could not share her\nprejudices (and women have a feeling akin to contempt for a man who does\nnot respond to their prejudices)--removed him at times almost beyond\nthe reach of her sympathy. It was interesting enough as long as the\nexperience was novel, to be thus unconsciously exploring another\nperson’s mind and finding so many strange objects there; but after a\nwhile the thing began to assume an uncomfortably serious aspect, and\nthen there seemed to be something almost terrible about it. At such\ntimes a call from a gentleman of her own nation, even though he were\none of the placidly stupid type, would be a positive relief; she could\nabandon herself to the secure sense of being at home; she need fear\nno surprises, and in the smooth shallows of their talk there were no\nunsuspected depths to excite and to baffle her ingenuity. And, again,\nreverting in her thought to Halfdan, his conversational brilliancy would\nalmost repel her, as something odious and un-American, the cheap result\nof outlandish birth and unrepublican education. Not that she had ever\nvalued republicanism very highly; she was one of those who associated\npolitics with noisy vulgarity in speech and dress, and therefore thanked\nfortune that women were permitted to keep aloof from it. But in the\npresence of this alien she found herself growing patriotic; that\nmuch-discussed abstraction, which we call our country (and which is\nnothing but the aggregate of all the slow and invisible influences which\ngo toward making up our own being), became by degrees a very palpable\nand intelligible fact to her.\n\nFrequently while her American self was thus loudly asserting itself,\nEdith inflicted many a cruel wound upon her foreign adorer. Once,--it\nwas the Fourth of July, more than a year after Halfdan’s arrival,\na number of young ladies and gentlemen, after having listened to a\npatriotic oration, were invited in to an informal luncheon. While\nwaiting, they naturally enough spent their time in singing national\nsongs, and Halfdan’s clear tenor did good service in keeping the\nstraggling voices together. When they had finished, Edith went up to him\nand was quite effusive in her expressions of gratitude.\n\n“I am sure we ought all to be very grateful to you, Mr. Birch,” she\nsaid, “and I, for my part, can assure you that I am.”\n\n“Grateful? Why?” demanded Halfdan, looking quite unhappy.\n\n“For singing OUR national songs, of course. Now, won’t you sing one\nof your own, please? We should all be so delighted to hear how a\nSwedish--or Norwegian, is it?--national song sounds.”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Birch, DO sing a Swedish song,” echoed several voices.\n\nThey, of course, did not even remotely suspect their own cruelty. He\nhad, in his enthusiasm for the day allowed himself to forget that he\nwas not made of the same clay as they were, that he was an exile and a\nstranger, and must ever remain so, that he had no right to share their\njoy in the blessing of liberty. Edith had taken pains to dispel the\nhappy illusion, and had sent him once more whirling toward his cold\nnative Pole. His passion came near choking him, and, to conceal his\nimpetuous emotion, he flung himself down on the piano-stool, and struck\nsome introductory chords with perhaps a little superfluous emphasis.\nSuddenly his voice burst out into the Swedish national anthem, “Our\nLand, our Land, our Fatherland,” and the air shook and palpitated\nwith strong martial melody. His indignation, his love and his misery,\nimparted strength to his voice, and its occasional tremble in the PIANO\npassages was something more than an artistic intention. He was loudly\napplauded as he arose, and the young ladies thronged about him to ask if\nhe “wouldn’t please write out the music for them.”\n\nThus month after month passed by, and every day brought its own misery.\nMrs. Van Kirk’s patronizing manners, and ostentatious kindness, often\ntested his patience to the utmost. If he was guilty of an innocent\nwitticism or a little quaintness of expression, she always assumed it\nto be a mistake of terms and corrected him with an air of benign\nsuperiority. At times, of course, her corrections were legitimate, as\nfor instance, when he spoke of WEARING a cane, instead of CARRYING\none, but in nine cases out of ten the fault lay in her own lack of\nimagination and not in his ignorance of English. On such occasions Edith\noften took pity on him, defended him against her mother’s criticism, and\ninsisted that if this or that expression was not in common vogue,\nthat was no reason why it should not be used, as it was perfectly\ngrammatical, and, moreover, in keeping with the spirit of the language.\nAnd he, listening passively in admiring silence to her argument, thanked\nher even for the momentary pain because it was followed by so great a\nhappiness. For it was so sweet to be defended by Edith, to feel that\nhe and she were standing together side by side against the outer world.\nCould he only show her in the old heroic manner how much he loved\nher! Would only some one that was dear to her die, so that he, in that\nbreaking down of social barriers which follows a great calamity, might\ncomfort her in her sorrow. Would she then, perhaps, weeping, lean her\nwonderful head upon his breast, feeling but that he was a fellow-mortal,\nwho had a heart that was loyal and true, and forgetting, for one\nbrief instant, that he was a foreigner. Then, to touch that delicate\nElizabethan frill which wound itself so daintily about Edith’s\nneck--what inconceivable rapture! But it was quite impossible. It could\nnever be. These were selfish thoughts, no doubt, but they were a lover’s\nselfishness, and, as such, bore a close kinship to all that is purest\nand best in human nature.\n\nIt is one of the tragic facts of this life, that a relation so unequal\nas that which existed between Halfdan and Edith, is at all possible. As\nfor Edith, I must admit that she was well aware that her teacher was in\nlove with her. Women have wonderfully keen senses for phenomena of that\nkind, and it is an illusion if any one imagines, as our Norseman did,\nthat he has locked his secret securely in the hidden chamber of his\nheart. In fleeting intonations, unconscious glances and attitudes,\nand through a hundred other channels it will make its way out, and the\nbereaved jailer may still clasp his key in fierce triumph, never knowing\nthat he has been robbed. It was of course no fault of Edith’s that she\nhad become possessed of Halfdan’s heart-secret. She regarded it as on\nthe whole rather an absurd affair, and prized it very lightly. That\na love so strong and yet so humble, so destitute of hope and still so\nunchanging, reverent and faithful, had something grand and touching in\nit, had never occurred to her. It is a truism to say that in our social\ncode the value of a man’s character is determined by his position; and\nfine traits in a foreigner (unless he should happen to be something very\ngreat) strike us rather as part of a supposed mental alienism, and as\nsuch, naturally suspicious. It is rather disgraceful than otherwise\nto have your music teacher in love with you, and critical friends will\nnever quite banish the suspicion that you have encouraged him.\n\nEdith had, in her first delight at the discovery of Halfdan’s talent,\nfrankly admitted him to a relation of apparent equality. He was a man\nof culture, had the manners and bearing of a gentleman, and had none\nof those theatrical airs which so often raise a sort of invisible wall\nbetween foreigners and Americans. Her mother, who loved to play the\npatron, especially to young men, had invited him to dinner-parties and\nintroduced him to their friends, until almost every one looked upon him\nas a protege of the family. He appeared so well in a parlor, and had\nreally such a distinguished presence, that it was a pleasure to look\nat him. He was remarkably free from those obnoxious traits which\ngeneralizing American travelers have led us to believe were inseparable\nfrom foreign birth; his finger-nails were in no way conspicuous; he did\nnot, as a French count, a former adorer of Edith’s, had done, indulge an\nunmasculine taste for diamond rings (possibly because he had none); his\npoliteness was unobtrusive and subdued, and of his accent there was just\nenough left to give an agreeable color of individuality to his speech.\nBut, for all that, Edith could never quite rid herself of the impression\nthat he was intensely un-American. There was a certain idyllic\nquiescence about him, a child-like directness and simplicity, and a\ntotal absence of “push,” which were startlingly at variance with the\nspirit of American life. An American could never have been content to\nremain in an inferior position without trying, in some way, to better\nhis fortunes. But Halfdan could stand still and see, without the\nfaintest stirring of envy, his plebeian friend Olson, whose education\nand talents could bear no comparison with his own, rise rapidly above\nhim, and apparently have no desire to emulate him. He could sit on a\ncricket in a corner, with Clara on his lap, and two or three little\ngirls nestling about him, and tell them fairy stories by the hour, while\nhis kindly face beamed with innocent happiness. And if Clara, to coax\nhim into continuing the entertainment, offered to kiss him, his measure\nof joy was full. This fair child, with her affectionate ways, and her\nconfiding prattle, wound herself ever more closely about his homeless\nheart, and he clung to her with a touching devotion. For she was the\nonly one who seemed to be unconscious of the difference of blood, who\nhad not yet learned that she was an American and he--a foreigner.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nThree years had passed by and still the situation was unchanged. Halfdan\nstill taught music and told fairy stories to the children. He had a\ngood many more pupils now than three years ago, although he had made no\neffort to solicit patronage, and had never tried to advertise his talent\nby what he regarded as vulgar and inartistic display. But Mrs. Van Kirk,\nwho had by this time discovered his disinclination to assert\nhimself, had been only the more active; had “talked him up” among her\naristocratic friends; had given musical soirees, at which she had coaxed\nhim to play the principal role, and had in various other ways exerted\nherself in his behalf. It was getting to be quite fashionable to admire\nhis quiet, unostentatious style of playing, which was so far removed\nfrom the noisy bravado and clap-trap then commonly in vogue. Even\nprofessional musicians began to indorse him, and some, who had\ndiscovered that “there was money in him,” made him tempting offers for a\npublic engagement. But, with characteristic modesty, he distrusted\ntheir verdict; his sensitive nature shrank from anything which had the\nappearance of self-assertion or display.\n\nBut Edith--ah, if it had not been for Edith he might have found courage\nto enter at the door of fortune, which was now opened ajar. That fame,\nif he should gain it, would bring him any nearer to her, was a thought\nthat was alien to so unworldly a temperament as his. And any action that\nhad no bearing upon his relation to her, left him cold--seemed unworthy\nof the effort. If she had asked him to play in public; if she had\nrequired of him to go to the North Pole, or to cut his own throat, I\nverily believe he would have done it. And at last Edith did ask him to\nplay. She and Olson had plotted together, and from the very friendliest\nmotives agreed to play into each other’s hands.\n\n“If you only WOULD consent to play,” said she, in her own persuasive\nway, one day as they had finished their lesson, “we should all be so\nhappy. Only think how proud we should be of your success, for you know\nthere is nothing you can’t do in the way of music if you really want\nto.”\n\n“Do you really think so?” exclaimed he, while his eyes suddenly grew\nlarge and luminous.\n\n“Indeed I do,” said Edith, emphatically.\n\n“And if--if I played well,” faltered he, “would it really please you?”\n\n“Of course it would,” cried Edith, laughing; “how can you ask such a\nfoolish question?”\n\n“Because I hardly dared to believe it.”\n\n“Now listen to me,” continued the girl, leaning forward in her chair,\nand beaming all over with kindly officiousness; “now for once you must\nbe rational and do just what I tell you. I shall never like you again if\nyou oppose me in this, for I have set my heart upon it; you must promise\nbeforehand that you will be good and not make any objection. Do you\nhear?”\n\nWhen Edith assumed this tone toward him, she might well have made him\npromise to perform miracles. She was too intent upon her benevolent\nscheme to heed the possible inferences which he might draw from her\nsudden display of interest.\n\n“Then you promise?” repeated she, eagerly, as he hesitated to answer.\n\n“Yes, I promise.”\n\n“Now, you must not be surprised; but mamma and I have made arrangements\nwith Mr. S---- that you are to appear under his auspices at a concert\nwhich is to be given a week from to-night. All our friends are going,\nand we shall take up all the front seats, and I have already told my\ngentlemen friends to scatter through the audience, and if they care\nanything for my favor, they will have to applaud vigorously.”\n\nHalfdan reddened up to his temples, and began to twist his watch-chain\nnervously.\n\n“You must have small confidence in my ability,” he murmured, “since you\nresort to precautions like these.”\n\n“But my dear Mr. Birch,” cried Edith, who was quick to discover that she\nhad made a mistake, “it is not kind in you to mistrust me in that way.\nIf a New York audience were as highly cultivated in music as you are,\nI admit that my precautions would be superfluous. But the papers, you\nknow, will take their tone from the audience, and therefore we must make\nuse of a little innocent artifice to make sure of it. Everything depends\nupon the success of your first public appearance, and if your friends\ncan in this way help you to establish the reputation which is nothing\nbut your right, I am sure you ought not to bind their hands by your\nfoolish sensitiveness. You don’t know the American way of doing things\nas well as I do, therefore you must stand by your promise, and leave\neverything to me.”\n\nIt was impossible not to believe that anything Edith chose to do was\nabove reproach. She looked so bewitching in her excited eagerness for\nhis welfare that it would have been inhuman to oppose her. So he meekly\nsuccumbed, and began to discuss with her the programme for the concert.\n\nDuring the next week there was hardly a day that he did not read some\nstartling paragraph in the newspapers about “the celebrated Scandinavian\npianist,” whose appearance at S---- Hall was looked forward to as the\nprincipal event of the coming season. He inwardly rebelled against\nthe well-meant exaggerations; but as he suspected that it was Edith’s\ninfluence which was in this way asserting itself in his behalf, he set\nhis conscience at rest and remained silent.\n\nThe evening of the concert came at last, and, as the papers stated the\nnext morning, “the large hall was crowded to its utmost capacity with\na select and highly appreciative audience.” Edith must have played her\npart of the performance skillfully, for as he walked out upon the stage,\nhe was welcomed with an enthusiastic burst of applause, as if he had\nbeen a world-renowned artist. At Edith’s suggestion, her two favorite\nnocturnes had been placed first upon the programme; then followed one\nof those ballads of Chopin, whose rhythmic din and rush sweep onward,\nbeleaguering the ear like eager, melodious hosts, charging in thickening\nranks and columns, beating impetuous retreats, and again uniting\nwith one grand emotion the wide-spreading army of sound for the\nfinal victory. Besides these, there was one of Liszt’s “Rhapsodies\nHongroises,” an impromptu by Schubert, and several orchestral pieces;\nbut the greater part of the programme was devoted to Chopin, because\nHalfdan, with his great, hopeless passion laboring in his breast, felt\nthat he could interpret Chopin better than he could any other composer.\nHe carried his audience by storm. As he retired to the dressing-room,\nafter having finished the last piece, his friends, among whom Edith and\nMrs. Van Kirk were the most conspicuous, thronged about him, showering\ntheir praises and congratulations upon him. They insisted with much\nfriendly urging upon taking him home in their carriage; Clara kissed\nhim, Mrs. Van Kirk introduced him to her lady acquaintances as “our\nfriend, Mr. Birch,” and Edith held his hand so long in hers that he came\nnear losing his presence of mind and telling her then and there that he\nloved her. As his eyes rested on her, they became suddenly suffused with\ntears, and a vast bewildering happiness vibrated through his frame.\nAt last he tore himself away and wandered aimlessly through the long,\nlonely streets. Why could he not tell Edith that he loved her? Was there\nany disgrace in loving? This heavenly passion which so suddenly had\ntransfused his being, and year by year deadened the substance of his old\nself, creating in its stead something new and wild and strange which he\nnever could know, but still held infinitely dear--had it been sent to\nhim merely as a scourge to test his capacity for suffering?\n\nOnce, while he was a child, his mother had told him that somewhere in\nthis wide world there lived a maiden whom God had created for him, and\nfor him alone, and when he should see her, he should love her, and his\nlife should thenceforth be all for her. It had hardly occurred to him,\nthen, to question whether she would love him in return, it had appeared\nso very natural that she should. Now he had found this maiden, and she\nhad been very kind to him; but her kindness had been little better than\ncruelty, because he had demanded something more than kindness. And still\nhe had never told her of his love. He must tell her even this very night\nwhile the moon rode high in the heavens and all the small differences\nbetween human beings seemed lost in the vast starlit stillness. He knew\nwell that by the relentless glare of the daylight his own insignificance\nwould be cruelly conspicuous in the presence of her splendor; his\nscruples would revive, and his courage fade.\n\nThe night was clear and still. A clock struck eleven in some church\ntower near by. The Van Kirk mansion rose tall and stately in the\nmoonlight, flinging a dense mass of shadow across the street. Up in the\nthird story he saw two windows lighted; the curtains were drawn, but the\nblinds were not closed. All the rest of the house was dark. He raised\nhis voice and sang a Swedish serenade which seemed in perfect concord\nwith his own mood. His clear tenor rose through the silence of the\nnight, and a feeble echo flung it back from the mansion opposite:\n\n     [3] “Star, sweet star, that brightly beamest,\n          Glittering on the skies nocturnal,\n          Hide thine eye no more from me,\n          Hide thine eye no more from me!”\n\nThe curtain was drawn aside, the window cautiously raised, and the\noutline of Edith’s beautiful head appeared dark and distinct against the\nlight within. She instantly recognized him.\n\n“You must go away, Mr. Birch,” came her voice in an anxious whisper out\nof the shadow. “Pray go away. You will wake up the people.”\n\nHer words were audible enough, but they failed to convey any meaning\nto his excited mind. Once more his voice floated upward to her opened\nwindow:\n\n     “And I yearn to reach thy dwelling,\n       Yearn to rise from earth’s fierce turmoil;\n       Sweetest star upward to thee,\n       Yearn to rise, bright star to thee.”\n\n\n“Dear Mr. Birch,” she whispered once more in tones of distress. “Pray DO\ngo away. Or perhaps,” she interrupted herself “--wait one moment and I\nwill come down.”\n\nPresently the front door was noiselessly opened, and Edith’s tall, lithe\nform, dressed in a white flowing dress, and with her blonde hair rolling\nloosely over her shoulders, appeared for an instant, and then again\nvanished. With one leap Halfdan sprang up the stairs and pushed through\nthe half-opened door. Edith closed the door behind him, then with rapid\nsteps led the way to the back parlor where the moon broke feebly through\nthe bars of the closed shutters.\n\n“Now Mr. Birch,” she said, seating herself upon a lounge, “you may\nexplain to me what this unaccountable behavior of yours means. I should\nhardly think I had deserved to be treated in this way by you.”\n\nHalfdan was utterly bewildered; a nervous fit of trembling ran through\nhim, and he endeavored in vain to speak. He had been prepared for\npassionate reproaches, but this calm severity chilled him through, and\nhe could only gasp and tremble, but could utter no word in his defense.\n\n“I suppose you are aware,” continued Edith, in the same imperturbable\nmanner, “that if I had not interrupted you, the policeman would have\nheard you, and you would have been arrested for street disturbance.\nThen to-morrow we should have seen it in all the newspapers, and I\nshould have been the laughing-stock of the whole town.”\n\nNo, surely he had never thought of it in that light; the idea struck\nhim as entirely new. There was a long pause. A cock crowed with a\ndrowsy remoteness in some neighboring yard, and the little clock on the\nmantel-piece ticked on patiently in the moonlit dusk.\n\n“If you have nothing to say,” resumed Edith, while the stern\nindifference in her voice perceptibly relaxed, “then I will bid you\ngood-night.”\n\nShe arose, and with a grand sweep of her drapery, moved toward the door.\n\n“Miss Edith,” cried he, stretching his hands despairingly after her,\n“you must not leave me.”\n\nShe paused, tossed her hair back with her hands, and gazed at him over\nher shoulder. He threw himself on his knees, seized the hem of\nher dress, and pressed it to his lips. It was a gesture of such\ninexpressible humility that even a stone would have relented.\n\n“Do not be foolish, Mr. Birch,” she said, trying to pull her dress away\nfrom him. “Get up, and if you have anything rational to say to me, I\nwill stay and listen.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” he whispered, hoarsely, “I shall be rational. Only do not\nleave me.”\n\nShe again sank down wearily upon the lounge, and looked at him in\nexpectant silence.\n\n“Miss Edith,” pleaded he in the same hoarse, passionate undertone, “have\npity on me, and do not despise me. I love you--oh--if you would but\nallow me to die for you, I should be the happiest of men.”\n\nAgain he shuddered, and stood long gazing at her with a mute, pitiful\nappeal. A tear stole into Edith’s eye and trickled down over her cheek.\n\n“Ah, Mr. Birch,” she murmured, while a sigh shook her bosom, “I am\nsorry--very sorry that this misfortune has happened to you. You have\ndeserved a better fate than to love me--to love a woman who can never\ngive you anything in return for what you give her.”\n\n“Never?” he repeated mournfully, “never?”\n\n“No, never! You have been a good friend to me, and as such I value you\nhighly, and I had hoped that you would always remain so. But I see that\nit cannot be. It will perhaps be best for you henceforth not to see\nme, at least not until--pardon the expression--you have outlived this\ngenerous folly. And now, you know, you will need me no more. You have\nmade a splendid reputation, and if you choose to avail yourself of it,\nyour fortune is already made. I shall always rejoice to hear of your\nsuccess, and--and if you should ever need a FRIEND, you must come to no\none but me. I know that these are feeble words, Mr. Birch, and if they\nseem cold to you, you must pardon me. I can say nothing more.”\n\nThey were indeed feeble words, although most cordially spoken. He\ntried to weigh them, to measure their meaning, but his mind was as if\nbenumbed, and utterly incapable of thought. He walked across the floor,\nperhaps only to do something, not feeling where he trod, but still with\nan absurd sensation that he was taking immoderately long steps. Then\nhe stopped abruptly, wrung his hands, and gazed at Edith. And suddenly,\nlike a flash in a vacuum, the thought shot through his brain that he had\nseen this very scene somewhere--in a dream, in a remote childhood, in a\nprevious existence, he did not know when or where. It seemed strangely\nfamiliar, and in the next instant strangely meaningless and unreal.\nThe walls, the floor--everything began to move, to whirl about him;\nhe struck his hands against his forehead, and sank down into a\ndamask-covered easy-chair. With a faint cry of alarm, Edith sprang up,\nseized a bottle of cologne which happened to be within reach, and knelt\ndown at his side. She put her arm around his neck, and raised his head.\n\n“Mr. Birch, dear Mr. Birch,” she cried, in a frightened whisper, “for\nGod’s sake come to yourself! O God, what have I done?”\n\nShe blew the eau-de-cologne into his face, and, as he languidly opened\nhis eyes, he felt the touch of her warm hand upon his cheeks and his\nforehead.\n\n“Thank heaven! he is better,” she murmured, still continuing to bathe\nhis temples. “How do you feel now, Mr. Birch?” she added, in a tone of\nanxious inquiry.\n\n“Thank you, it was an unpardonable weakness,” he muttered, without\nchanging his attitude. “Do not trouble yourself about me. I shall soon\nbe well.”\n\nIt was so sweet to be conscious of her gentle ministry, that it required\na great effort, an effort of conscience, to rouse him once more, as his\nstrength returned.\n\n“Had you not better stay?” she asked, as he rose to put on his overcoat.\n“I will call one of the servants and have him show you a room. We will\nsay to-morrow morning that you were taken ill, and nobody will wonder.”\n\n“No, no,” he responded, energetically. “I am perfectly strong now.” But\nhe still had to lean on a chair, and his face was deathly pale.\n\n“Farewell, Miss Edith,” he said; and a tender sadness trembled in his\nvoice. “Farewell. We shall--probably--never meet again.”\n\n“Do not speak so,” she answered, seizing his hand. “You will try to\nforget this, and you will still be great and happy. And when fortune\nshall again smile upon you, and--and--you will be content to be my\nfriend, then we shall see each other as before.”\n\n“No, no,” he broke forth, with a sudden hoarseness. “It will never be.”\n\nHe walked toward the door with the motions of one who feels death in his\nlimbs; then stopped once more and his eyes lingered with inexpressible\nsadness on the wonderful, beloved form which stood dimly outlined before\nhim in the twilight. Then Edith’s measure of misery, too, seemed full.\nWith the divine heedlessness which belongs to her sex, she rushed up\ntoward him, and remembering only that he was weak and unhappy, and that\nhe suffered for her sake, she took his face between her hands and kissed\nhim. He was too generous a man to misinterpret the act; so he whispered\nbut once more: “Farewell,” and hastened away.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nAfter that eventful December night, America was no more what it had been\nto Halfdan Bjerk. A strange torpidity had come over him; every rising\nday gazed into his eyes with a fierce unmeaning glare. The noise of the\nstreet annoyed him and made him childishly fretful, and the solitude\nof his own room seemed still more dreary and depressing. He went\nmechanically through the daily routine of his duties as if the soul\nhad been taken out of his work, and left his life all barrenness and\ndesolation. He moved restlessly from place to place, roamed at all times\nof the day and night through the city and its suburbs, trying vainly to\nexhaust his physical strength; gradually, as his lethargy deepened\ninto a numb, helpless despair, it seemed somehow to impart a certain\ntoughness to his otherwise delicate frame. Olson, who was now a junior\npartner in the firm of Remsen, Van Kirk and Co., stood by him faithfully\nin these days of sorrow. He was never effusive in his sympathy, but was\npatiently forbearing with his friend’s whims and moods, and humored\nhim as if he had been a sick child intrusted to his custody. That Edith\nmight be the moving cause of Olson’s kindness was a thought which,\nstrangely enough, had never occurred to Halfdan.\n\nAt last, when spring came, the vacancy of his mind was suddenly invaded\nwith a strong desire to revisit his native land. He disclosed his plan\nto Olson, who, after due deliberation and several visits to the Van Kirk\nmansion, decided that the pleasure of seeing his old friends and the\nscenes of his childhood might push the painful memories out of sight,\nand renew his interest in life. So, one morning, while the May sun\nshone with a soft radiance upon the beautiful harbor, our Norseman found\nhimself standing on the deck of a huge black-hulled Cunarder, shivering\nin spite of the warmth, and feeling a chill loneliness creeping over him\nat the sight of the kissing and affectionate leave-takings which were\ngoing on all around him. Olson was running back and forth, attending\nto his baggage; but he himself took no thought, and felt no more\nresponsibility than if he had been a helpless child. He half regretted\nthat his own wish had prevailed, and was inclined to hold his friend\nresponsible for it; and still he had not energy enough to protest now\nwhen the journey seemed inevitable. His heart still clung to the place\nwhich held the corpse of his ruined life, as a man may cling to the spot\nwhich hides his beloved dead.\n\nAbout two weeks later Halfdan landed in Norway. He was half reluctant to\nleave the steamer, and the land of his birth excited no emotion in his\nbreast. He was but conscious of a dim regret that he was so far away\nfrom Edith. At last, however, he betook himself to a hotel, where he\nspent the afternoon sitting with half-closed eyes at a window, watching\nlistlessly the drowsy slow-pulsed life which dribbled languidly through\nthe narrow thoroughfare. The noisy uproar of Broadway chimed remotely\nin his ears, like the distant roar of a tempest-tossed sea, and what had\nonce been a perpetual annoyance was now a sweet memory. How often with\nEdith at his side had he threaded his way through the surging crowds\nthat pour, on a fine afternoon, in an unceasing current up and down the\nstreet between Union and Madison Squares. How friendly, and sweet, and\ngracious, Edith had been at such times; how fresh her voice, how witty\nand animated her chance remarks when they stopped to greet a passing\nacquaintance; and, above all, how inspiring the sight of her heavenly\nbeauty. Now that was all past. Perhaps he should never see Edith again.\n\nThe next day he sauntered through the city, meeting some old friends,\nwho all seemed changed and singularly uninteresting. They were all\nengaged or married, and could talk of nothing but matrimony, and\ntheir prospects of advancement in the Government service. One had\nan influential uncle who had been a chum of the present minister of\nfinance; another based his hopes of future prosperity upon the family\nconnections of his betrothed, and a third was waiting with a patient\nperseverance, worthy of a better cause, for the death or resignation of\nan antiquated chef-de-bureau, which, according to the promise of some\nmighty man, would open a position for him in the Department of Justice.\nAll had the most absurd theories about American democracy, and indulged\nfreely in prophecies of coming disasters; but about their own government\nthey had no opinion whatever. If Halfdan attempted to set them right,\nthey at once grew excited and declamatory; their opinions were based\nupon conviction and a charming ignorance of facts, and they were not to\nbe moved. They knew all about Tweed and the Tammany Ring, and believed\nthem to be representative citizens of New York, if not of the United\nStates; but of Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz they had never heard.\nHalfdan, who, in spite of his misfortunes in the land of his adoption,\ncherished a very tender feeling for it, was often so thoroughly aroused\nat the foolish prejudices which everywhere met him, that his torpidity\ngradually thawed away, and he began to look more like his former self.\n\nToward autumn he received an invitation to visit a country clergyman in\nthe North, a distant relative of his father’s, and there whiled away\nhis time, fishing and shooting, until winter came. But as Christmas drew\nnear, and the day wrestled feebly with the all-conquering night, the old\nsorrow revived. In the darkness which now brooded over land and sea,\nthe thoughts needed no longer be on guard against themselves; they could\nroam far and wide as they listed. Where was Edith now, the sweet, the\nwonderful Edith? Was there yet the same dancing light in her beautiful\neyes, the same golden sheen in her hair, the same merry ring in her\nvoice? And had she not said that when he was content to be only her\nfriend, he might return to her, and she would receive him in the old\njoyous and confiding way? Surely there was no life to him apart from\nher: why should he not be her friend? Only a glimpse of her lovely\nface--ah, it was worth a lifetime; it would consecrate an age of misery,\na glimpse of Edith’s face. Thus ran his fancies day by day, and the\nnight only lent a deeper intensity to the yearnings of the day. He\nwalked about as in a dream, seeing nothing, heeding nothing, while this\none strong desire--to see Edith once more--throbbed and throbbed with a\nslow, feverish perseverance within him. Edith--Edith, the very name had\na strange, potent fascination. Every thought whispered “Edith,”--his\npulse beat “Edith,”--and his heart repeated the beloved name. It was his\npulse-beat,--his heartbeat,--his life-beat.\n\nAnd one morning as he stood absently looking at his fingers against the\nlight--and they seemed strangely wan and transparent--the thought at\nlast took shape. It rushed upon him with such vehemence, that he could\nno more resist it. So he bade the clergyman good-bye, gathered his few\nworldly goods together and set out for Bergen. There he found an English\nsteamer which carried him to Hull, and a few weeks later, he was once\nmore in New York.\n\nIt was late one evening in January that a tug-boat arrived and took the\ncabin passengers ashore. The moon sailed tranquilly over the deep blue\ndome of the sky, the stars traced their glittering paths of light from\nthe zenith downward, and it was sharp, bitter cold. Northward over the\nriver lay a great bank of cloud, dense, gray and massive, the spectre\nof the coming snow-storm. There it lay so huge and fantastically human,\nruffling itself up, as fowls do, in defense against the cold. Halfdan\nwalked on at a brisk rate--strange to say, all the street-cars he met\nwent the wrong way--startling every now and then some precious memory,\nsome word or look or gesture of Edith’s which had hovered long\nover those scenes, waiting for his recognition. There was the great\njewel-store where Edith had taken him so often to consult his taste\nwhenever a friend of hers was to be married. It was there that they had\nhad an amicable quarrel over that bronze statue of Faust which she\nhad found beautiful, while he, with a rudeness which seemed now quite\nincomprehensible, had insisted that it was not. And when he had\nfailed to convince her, she had given him her hand in token of\nreconciliation--and Edith had a wonderful way of giving her hand, which\nmade any one feel that it was a peculiar privilege to press it--and they\nhad walked out arm in arm into the animated, gas-lighted streets, with\na delicious sense of snugness and security, being all the more closely\nunited for their quarrel. Here, farther up the avenue, they had once\nbeen to a party, and he had danced for the first time in his life\nwith Edith. Here was Delmonico’s, where they had had such fascinating\nluncheons together; where she had got a stain on her dress, and he had\nbeen forced to observe that her dress was then not really a part of\nherself, since it was a thing that could not be stained. Her dress had\nalways seemed to him as something absolute and final, exalted above\ncriticism, incapable of improvement.\n\nAs I have said, Halfdan walked briskly up the avenue, and it was\nsomething after eleven when he reached the house which he sought. The\ngreat cloud-bank in the north had then begun to expand and stretched its\nlong misty arms eastward and westward over the heavens. The windows on\nthe ground-floor were dark, but the sleeping apartments in the upper\nstories were lighted. In Edith’s room the inside shutters were closed,\nbut one of the windows was a little down at the top. And as he stood\ngazing with tremulous happiness up to that window, a stanza from Heine\nwhich he and Edith had often read together, came into his head. It was\nthe story of the youth who goes to the Madonna at Kevlar and brings her\nas a votive offering a heart of wax, that she may heal him of his love\nand his sorrow.\n\n     “I bring this waxen image,\n       The image of my heart,\n       Heal thou my bitter sorrow,\n       And cure my deadly smart!” [4]\n\nThen came the thought that for him, too, as for the poor youth of\nCologne, there was healing only in death. And still in this moment\nhe was so near Edith, should see her perhaps, and the joy at this was\nstronger than all else, stronger even than death. So he sat down beside\nthe steps of the mansion opposite, where there was some shelter from the\nwind, and waited patiently till Edith should close her window. He was\ncold, perhaps, but, if so, he hardly knew it, for the near joy of seeing\nher throbbed warmly in his veins. Ah, there--the blinds were thrown\nopen; Edith, in all the lithe magnificence of her wonderful form, stood\nout clear and beautiful against the light within; she pushed up the\nlower window in order to reach the upper one, and for a moment leaned\nout over the sill. Once more her wondrous profile traced itself in\nstrong relief against the outer gloom. There came a cry from the street\nbelow, a feeble involuntary one, but still distinctly audible. Edith\npeered anxiously out into the darkness, but the darkness had grown\ndenser and she could see nothing. The window was fastened, the shutters\nclosed, and the broad pathway of light which she had flung out upon the\nnight had vanished.\n\nHalfdan closed his eyes trying to retain the happy vision. Yes, there\nshe stood still, and there was a heavenly smile upon her lips--ugh, he\nshivered--the snow swept in a wild whirl up the street. He wrapped his\nplaid more closely about him, and strained his eyes to catch one more\nglimpse of the beloved Edith. Ah, yes; there she was again; she came\nnearer and nearer, and she touched his cheek, gently, warily smiling\nall the while with a strange wistful smile which was surely not Edith’s.\nThere, she bent over him,--touched him again,--how cold her hands were;\nthe touch chilled him to the heart. The snow had now begun to fall in\nlarge scattered flakes, whirling fitfully through the air, following\nevery chance gust of wind, but still falling, falling, and covering the\nearth with its white, death-like shroud.\n\nBut surely--there was Edith again,--how wonderful!--in a long snow-white\nrobe, grave and gracious, still with the wistful smile on her lips. See,\nshe beckons to him with her hand, and he rises to follow, but something\nheavy clings to his feet and he cannot stir from the spot. He tries to\ncry for help, but he cannot,--can only stretch out his hands to her, and\nfeel very unhappy that he cannot follow her. But now she pauses in her\nflight, turns about, and he sees that she wears a myrtle garland in her\nhair like a bride. She comes toward him, her countenance all radiant\nwith love and happiness, and she stoops down over him and speaks:\n\n“Come; they are waiting for us. I will follow thee in life and in death,\nwherever thou goest. Come,” repeats Edith, “they have long been waiting.\nThey are all here.”\n\nAnd he imagines he knows who they all are, although he has never heard\nof them, nor can he recall their names.\n\n“But--but,” he stammers, “I--I--am a foreigner ”\n\nIt appeared then that for some reason this was an insurmountable\nobjection. And Edith’s happiness dies out of her beautiful face, and she\nturns away weeping.\n\n“Edith, beloved!”\n\nThen she is once more at his side.\n\n“Thou art no more a foreigner to me, beloved. Whatever thou art, I am.”\n\nAnd she presses her lips to his--it was the sweetest kiss of his\nlife--the kiss of death.\n\nThe next morning, as Edith, after having put the last touch to her\ntoilet, threw the shutters open, a great glare of sun-smitten snow burst\nupon her and for a moment blinded her eyes. On the sidewalk opposite,\nhalf a dozen men with snow-shovels in their hands and a couple of\npoliceman had congregated, and, judging by their manner, were discussing\nsome object of interest. Presently they were joined by her father, who\nhad just finished his breakfast and was on his way to the office. Now\nhe stooped down and gazed at something half concealed in the snow, then\nsuddenly started back, and as she caught a glimpse of his face, she saw\nthat it was ghastly white. A terrible foreboding seized her. She threw\na shawl about her shoulders and rushed down-stairs. In the hall she was\nmet by her father, who was just entering, followed by four men, carrying\nsomething between them. She well knew what it was. She would fain have\nturned away, but she could not: grasping her father’s arm and pressing\nit hard, she gazed with blank, frightened eyes at the white face, the\nlines of which Death had so strangely emphasized. The snow-flakes which\nhung in his hair had touched him with their sudden age, as if to bridge\nthe gulf between youth and death. And still he was beautiful--the clear\nbrow, the peaceful, happy indolence, the frozen smile which death had\nperpetuated. Smiling, he had departed from the earth which had no place\nfor him, and smiling entered the realm where, among the many mansions,\nthere is, perhaps, also one for a gentle, simple-hearted enthusiast.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF AN OUTCAST.\n\nTHERE was an ancient feud between the families; and Bjarne Blakstad\nwas not the man to make it up, neither was Hedin Ullern. So they looked\naskance at each other whenever they met on the highway, and the one\ntook care not to cross the other’s path. But on Sundays, when the\nchurch-bells called the parishioners together, they could not very well\navoid seeing each other on the church-yard; and then, one day, many\nyears ago, when the sermon had happened to touch Bjarne’s heart, he had\nnodded to Hedin and said: “Fine weather to-day;” and Hedin had returned\nthe nod and answered: “True is that.” “Now I have done my duty before\nGod and men,” thought Bjarne, “and it is his turn to take the next\nstep.” “The fellow is proud,” said Hedin to himself, “and he wants to\nshow off his generosity. But I know the wolf by his skin, even if he has\nlearned to bleat like a ewe-lamb.”\n\nWhat the feud really was about, they had both nearly forgotten. All they\nknew was that some thirty years ago there had been a quarrel between the\npastor and the parish about the right of carrying arms to the church.\nAnd then Bjarne’s father had been the spokesman of the parish, while\nHedin’s grandsire had been a staunch defender of the pastor. There was a\nrumor, too, that they had had a fierce encounter somewhere in the woods,\nand that the one had stabbed the other with a knife; but whether that\nwas really true, no one could tell.\n\nBjarne was tall and grave, like the weather-beaten fir-trees in his\nmast-forest. He had a large clean-shaven face, narrow lips, and small\nfierce eyes. He seldom laughed, and when he did, his laugh seemed even\nfiercer than his frown. He wore his hair long, as his fathers had\ndone, and dressed in the styles of two centuries ago; his breeches were\nclasped with large silver buckles at the knees, and his red jerkin was\ngathered about his waist with a leathern girdle. He loved everything\nthat was old, in dress as well as in manners, took no newspapers, and\nregarded railroads and steamboats as inventions of the devil. Bjarne had\nmarried late in life, and his marriage had brought him two daughters,\nBrita and Grimhild.\n\nHedin Ullern was looked upon as an upstart. He could only count three\ngenerations back, and he hardly knew himself how his grandfather had\nearned the money that had enabled him to buy a farm and settle down\nin the valley. He had read a great deal, and was well informed on\nthe politics of the day; his name had even been mentioned for\nstorthingsmand, or member of parliament from the district, and it\nwas the common opinion, that if Bjarne Blakstad had not so vigorously\nopposed him, he would have been elected, being the only “cultivated”\n peasant in the valley. Hedin was no unwelcome guest in the houses of\ngentlefolks, and he was often seen at the judge’s and the pastor’s\nomber parties. And for all this Bjarne Blakstad only hated him the more.\nHedin’s wife, Thorgerda, was fair-haired, tall and stout, and it was\nshe who managed the farm, while her husband read his books, and studied\npolitics in the newspapers; but she had a sharp tongue and her neighbors\nwere afraid of her. They had one son, whose name was Halvard.\n\nBrita Blakstad, Bjarne’s eldest daughter, was a maid whom it was a joy\nto look upon. They called her “Glitter-Brita,” because she was fond of\nrings and brooches, and everything that was bright; while she was\nstill a child, she once took the old family bridal-crown out from the\nstorehouse and carried it about on her head. “Beware of that crown,\nchild,” her father had said to her, “and wear it not before the time.\nThere is not always blessing in the bridal silver.” And she looked\nwonderingly up into his eyes and answered: “But it glitters, father;”\n and from that time forth they had named her Glitter-Brita.\n\nAnd Glitter-Brita grew up to be a fair and winsome maiden, and wherever\nshe went the wooers flocked on her path. Bjarne shook his head at\nher, and often had harsh words upon his lips, when he saw her braiding\nfield-flowers into her yellow tresses or clasping the shining brooches\nto her bodice; but a look of hers or a smile would completely disarm\nhim. She had a merry way of doing things which made it all seem like\nplay; but work went rapidly from her hands, while her ringing laughter\nechoed through the house, and her sunny presence made it bright in the\ndusky ancestral halls. In her kitchen the long rows of copper pots and\npolished kettles shone upon the walls, and the neatly scoured milk-pails\nstood like soldiers on parade about the shelves under the ceiling.\nBjarne would often sit for hours watching her, and a strange\nspring-feeling would steal into his heart. He felt a father’s pride in\nher stately growth and her rich womanly beauty. “Ah!” he would say to\nhimself, “she has the pure blood in her veins and, as true as I live,\nthe farm shall be hers.” And then, quite contrary to his habits, he\nwould indulge in a little reverie, imagining the time when he, as an\naged man, should have given the estate over into her hands, and seeing\nher as a worthy matron preside at the table, and himself rocking his\ngrandchildren on his knee. No wonder, then, that he eyed closely the\nyoung lads who were beginning to hover about the house, and that he\nlooked with suspicion upon those who selected Saturday nights for their\nvisits. [5] When Brita was twenty years old, however, her father thought\nthat it was time for her to make her choice. There were many fine, brave\nlads in the valley, and, as Bjarne thought, Brita would have the good\nsense to choose the finest and the bravest. So, when the winter came, he\nsuddenly flung his doors open to the youth of the parish, and began to\ngive parties with ale and mead in the grand old style. He even talked\nwith the young men, at times, encouraged them to manly sports, and urged\nthem to taste of his home-brewed drinks and to tread the spring-dance\nbriskly. And Brita danced and laughed so that her hair flew around her\nand the silver brooches tinkled and rang on her bosom. But when the\nmerriment was at an end, and any one of the lads remained behind to\noffer her his hand, she suddenly grew grave, told him she was too young,\nthat she did not know herself, and that she had had no time as yet to\ndecide so serious a question. Thus the winter passed and the summer drew\nnear.\n\nIn the middle of June, Brita went to the saeter [6] with the cattle; and\nher sister, Grimhild, remained at home to keep house on the farm. She\nloved the life in the mountains; the great solitude sometimes made her\nfeel sad, but it was not an unpleasant sadness, it was rather a gentle\ntoning down of all the shrill and noisy feelings of the soul. Up there,\nin the heart of the primeval forest, her whole being seemed to herself\na symphony of melodious whispers with a vague delicious sense of\nremoteness and mystery in them, which she only felt and did not attempt\nto explain. There, those weird legends which, in former days, still held\ntheir sway in the fancy of every Norsewoman, breathed their secrets into\nher ear, and she felt her nearness and kinship to nature, as at no other\ntime.\n\nOne night, as the sun was low, and a purple bluish smoke hung like a\nthin veil over the tops of the forest, Brita had taken out her knitting\nand seated herself on a large moss-grown stone, on the croft. Her eyes\nwandered over the broad valley which was stretched out below, and she\ncould see the red roofs of the Blakstad mansion peeping forth between\nthe fir-trees. And she wondered what they were doing down there, whether\nGrimhild had done milking, and whether her father had returned from the\nford, where it was his habit at this hour to ride with the footmen\nto water the horses. As she sat thus wondering, she was startled by a\ncreaking in the dry branches hard by, and lifting her eye, she saw a\ntall, rather clumsily built, young man emerging from the thicket. He\nhad a broad but low forehead, flaxen hair which hung down over a pair of\ndull ox-like eyes; his mouth was rather large and, as it was half open,\ndisplayed two massive rows of shining white teeth. His red peaked cap\nhung on the back of his head and, although it was summer, his thick\nwadmal vest was buttoned close up to his throat; over his right arm he\nhad flung his jacket, and in his hand he held a bridle.\n\n“Good evening,” said Brita, “and thanks for last meeting;” although she\nwas not sure that she had ever seen him before.\n\n“It was that bay mare, you know,” stammered the man in a half apologetic\ntone, and shook the bridle, as if in further explanation.\n\n“Ah, you have lost your mare,” said the girl, and she could not help\nsmiling at his helplessness and his awkward manner.\n\n“Yes, it was the bay mare,” answered he, in the same diffident tone;\nthen, encouraged by her smile, he straightened himself a little and\ncontinued rather more fluently: “She never was quite right since the\ntime the wolves were after her. And then since they took the colt away\nfrom her the milk has been troubling her, and she hasn’t been quite like\nherself.”\n\n“I haven’t seen her anywhere hereabouts,” said Brita; “you may have to\nwander far, before you get on the track of her.”\n\n“Yes, that is very likely. And I am tired already.”\n\n“Won’t you sit down and rest yourself?”\n\nHe deliberately seated himself in the grass, and gradually gained\ncourage to look her straight in the face; and his dull eye remained\nsteadfastly fixed on her in a way which bespoke unfeigned surprise and\nadmiration. Slowly his mouth broadened into a smile; but his smile had\nmore of sadness than of joy in it. She had, from the moment she saw him,\nbeen possessed of a strangely patronizing feeling toward him. She could\nnot but treat him as if he had been a girl or some person inferior to\nher in station. In spite of his large body, the impression he made upon\nher was that of weakness; but she liked the sincerity and kindness which\nexpressed themselves in his sad smile and large, honest blue eyes.\nHis gaze reminded her of that of an ox, but it had not only the ox’s\ndullness, but also its simplicity and good-nature.\n\nThey sat talking on for a while about the weather, the cattle, and the\nprospects of the crops.\n\n“What is your name?” she asked, at last.\n\n“Halvard Hedinson Ullern.”\n\nA sudden shock ran through her at the sound of that name; in the next\nmoment a deep blush stole over her countenance.\n\n“And my name,” she said, slowly, “is Brita Bjarne’s daughter Blakstad.”\n\nShe fixed her eyes upon him, as if to see what effect her words\nproduced. But his features wore the same sad and placid expression; and\nno line in his face seemed to betray either surprise or ill-will. Then\nher sense of patronage grew into one of sympathy and pity. “He must\neither be weak-minded or very unhappy,” thought she, “and what right\nhave I then to treat him harshly.” And she continued her simple,\nstraightforward talk with the young man, until he, too, grew almost\ntalkative, and the sadness of his smile began to give way to something\nwhich almost resembled happiness. She noticed the change and rejoiced.\nAt last, when the sun had sunk behind the western mountain tops,\nshe rose and bade him good-night; in another moment the door of the\nsaeter-cottage closed behind her, and he heard her bolting it on the\ninside. But for a long time he remained sitting on the grass, and\nstrange thoughts passed through his head. He had quite forgotten his bay\nmare.\n\nThe next evening when the milking was done, and the cattle were gathered\nwithin the saeter enclosure, Brita was again sitting on the large stone,\nlooking out over the valley. She felt a kind of companionship with the\npeople when she saw the smoke whirling up from their chimneys, and she\ncould guess what they were going to have for supper. As she sat there,\nshe again heard a creaking in the branches, and Halvard Ullern stood\nagain before her, with his jacket on his arm, and the same bridle in his\nhand.\n\n“You have not found your bay mare yet?” she exclaimed, laughingly. “And\nyou think she is likely to be in this neighborhood?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he answered; “and I don’t care if she isn’t.”\n\nHe spread his jacket on the grass, and sat down on the spot where he\nhad sat the night before. Brita looked at him in surprise and remained\nsilent; she didn’t know how to interpret this second visit.\n\n“You are very handsome,” he said, suddenly, with a gravity which left no\ndoubt as to his sincerity.\n\n“Do you think so?” she answered, with a merry laugh. He appeared to her\nalmost a child, and it never entered her mind to feel offended. On the\ncontrary, she was not sure but that she felt pleased.\n\n“I have thought of you ever since yesterday,” he continued, with the\nsame imperturbable manner. “And if you were not angry with me, I thought\nI would like to look at you once more. You are so different from other\nfolks.”\n\n“God bless your foolish talk,” cried Brita, with a fresh burst of\nmerriment. “No, indeed I am not angry with you; I should just as soon\nthink of being angry with--with that calf,” she added for want of\nanother comparison.\n\n“You think I don’t know much,” he stammered. “And I don’t.” The sad\nsmile again settled on his countenance.\n\nA feeling of guilt sent the blood throbbing through her veins. She saw\nthat she had done him injustice. He evidently possessed more sense, or\nat least a finer instinct, than she had given him credit for.\n\n“Halvard,” she faltered, “if I have offended you, I assure you I didn’t\nmean to do it; and a thousand times I beg your pardon.”\n\n“You haven’t offended me, Brita,” answered he, blushing like a girl.\n“You are the first one who doesn’t make me feel that I am not so wise as\nother folks.”\n\nShe felt it her duty to be open and confiding with him in return; and in\norder not to seem ungenerous, or rather to put them on an equal footing\nby giving him also a peep into her heart, she told him about her daily\nwork, about the merry parties at her father’s house, and about the\nlusty lads who gathered in their halls to dance the Halling and the\nspring-dance. He listened attentively while she spoke, gazing earnestly\ninto her face, but never interrupting her. In his turn he described to\nher in his slow deliberate way, how his father constantly scolded him\nbecause he was not bright, and did not care for politics and newspapers,\nand how his mother wounded him with her sharp tongue by making merry\nwith him, even in the presence of the servants and strangers. He did not\nseem to imagine that there was anything wrong in what he said, or that\nhe placed himself in a ludicrous light; nor did he seem to speak\nfrom any unmanly craving for sympathy. His manner was so simple and\nstraightforward that what Brita probably would have found strange in\nanother, she found perfectly natural in him.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when they parted{.} She hardly slept at all that\nnight, and she was half vexed with herself for the interest she took\nin this simple youth. The next morning her father came up to pay her a\nvisit and to see how the flocks were thriving. She understood that it\nwould be dangerous to say anything to him about Halvard, for she knew\nhis temper and feared the result, if he should ever discover her secret.\nTherefore, she shunned an opportunity to talk with him, and only busied\nherself the more with the cattle and the cooking. Bjarne soon noticed\nher distraction, but, of course, never suspected the cause. Before he\nleft her, he asked her if she did not find it too lonely on the saeter,\nand if it would not be well if he sent her one of the maids for a\ncompanion. She hastened to assure him that that was quite unnecessary;\nthe cattle-boy who was there to help her was all the company she wanted.\nToward evening, Bjarne Blakstad loaded his horses with buckets, filled\nwith cheese and butter, and started for the valley. Brita stood long\nlooking after him as he descended the rocky slope, and she could hardly\nconceal from herself that she felt relieved, when, at last, the forest\nhid him from her sight. All day she had been walking about with a heavy\nheart; there seemed to be something weighing on her breast, and she\ncould not throw it off. Who was this who had come between her and her\nfather? Had she ever been afraid of him before, had she been glad to\nhave him leave her? A sudden bitterness took possession of her, for in\nher distress, she gave Halvard the blame for all that had happened.\nShe threw herself down on the grass and burst into a passionate fit of\nweeping; she was guilty, wretchedly miserable, and all for the sake of\none whom she had hardly known for two days. If he should come in this\nmoment, she would tell him what he had done toward her; and her wish\nmust have been heard, for as she raised her eyes, he stood there at her\nside, the sad feature about his mouth and his great honest eyes gazing\nwonderingly at her. She felt her purpose melt within her; he looked so\ngood and so unhappy. Then again came the thought of her father and of\nher own wrong, and the bitterness again revived.\n\n“Go away,” cried she, in a voice half reluctantly tender and half\ndefiant. “Go away, I say; I don’t want to see you any more.”\n\n“I will go to the end of the world if you wish it,” he answered, with a\nstrange firmness.\n\nHe picked up his jacket which he had dropped on the ground, then turned\nslowly, gave her mother long look, an infinitely sad and hopeless one,\nand went. Her bosom heaved violently--remorse, affection and filial duty\nwrestled desperately in her heart.\n\n“No, no,” she cried, “why do you go? I did not mean it so. I only\nwanted--”\n\nHe paused and returned as deliberately as he had gone.\n\nWhy should I dwell upon the days that followed--how her heart grew ever\nmore restless, how she would suddenly wake up at nights and see those\nlarge blue eyes sadly gazing at her, how by turns she would condemn\nherself and him, and how she felt with bitter pain that she was growing\naway from those who had hitherto been nearest and dearest to her. And\nstrange to say, this very isolation from her father made her cling\nonly the more desperately to him. It seemed to her as if Bjarne had\ndeliberately thrown her off; that she herself had been the one who\ntook the first step had hardly occurred to her. Alas, her grief was as\nirrational as her love. By what strange devious process of reasoning\nthese convictions became settled in her mind, it is difficult to tell.\nIt is sufficient to know that she was a woman and that she loved. She\neven knew herself that she was irrational, and this very sense drew her\nmore hopelessly into the maze of the labyrinth from which she saw no\nescape.\n\nHis visits were as regular as those of the sun. She knew that there was\nonly a word of hers needed to banish him from her presence forever. And\nhow many times did she not resolve to speak that word? But the word was\nnever spoken. At times a company of the lads from the valley would come\nto spend a merry evening at the saeter; but she heeded them not, and\nthey soon disappeared. Thus the summer went amid passing moods of joy\nand sorrow. She had long known that he loved her, and when at last\nhis slow confession came, it added nothing to her happiness; it only\nincreased her fears for the future. They laid many plans together in\nthose days; but winter came as a surprise to both, the cattle were\nremoved from the mountains, and they were again separated.\n\nBjarne Blakstad looked long and wistfully at his daughter that morning,\nwhen he came to bring her home. She wore no more rings and brooches,\nand it was this which excited Bjarne’s suspicion that everything was not\nright with her. Formerly he was displeased because she wore too many;\nnow he grumbled because she wore none.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe winter was half gone; and in all this time Brita had hardly once\nseen Halvard. Yes, once,--it was Christmas-day,--she had ventured to\npeep over to his pew in the church, and had seen him, sitting at his\nfather’s side, and gazing vacantly out into the empty space; but as he\nhad caught her glance, he had blushed, and began eagerly to turn the\nleaves of his hymn-book. It troubled her that he made no effort to see\nher; many an evening she had walked alone down at the river-side, hoping\nthat he might come; but it was all in vain. She could not but believe\nthat his father must have made some discovery, and that he was watched.\nIn the mean time the black cloud thickened over her head; for a secret\ngnawed at the very roots of her heart. It was a time of terrible\nsuspense and suffering--such as a man never knows, such as only a woman\ncan endure. It was almost a relief when the cloud burst, and the storm\nbroke loose, as presently it did.\n\nOne Sunday, early in April, Bjarne did not return at the usual hour from\nchurch. His daughters waited in vain for him with the dinner, and at\nlast began to grow uneasy. It was not his habit to keep irregular hours.\nThere was a great excitement in the valley just then; the America-fever\nhad broken out. A large vessel was lying out in the fjord, ready to take\nthe emigrants away; and there was hardly a family that did not mourn the\nloss of some brave-hearted son, or of some fair and cherished daughter.\nThe old folks, of course, had to remain behind; and when the children\nwere gone, what was there left for them but to lie down and die? America\nwas to them as distant as if it were on another planet. The family\nfeeling, too, has ever been strong in the Norseman’s breast; he lives\nfor his children, and seems to live his life over again in them. It is\nhis greatest pride to be able to trace his blood back into the days of\nSverre and St. Olaf, and with the same confidence he expects to see his\nrace spread into the future in the same soil where once it has struck\nroot. Then comes the storm from the Western seas, wrestles with the\nsturdy trunk, and breaks it; and the shattered branches fly to all the\nfour corners of the heavens. No wonder, then, like a tree that has lost\nits crown, his strength is broken and he expects but to smoulder into\nthe earth and die.\n\nBjarne Blakstad, like the sturdy old patriot that he was, had always\nfiercely denounced the America rage; and it was now the hope of his\ndaughters that, perhaps, he had stayed behind to remind the restless\nones among the youth of their duty toward their land, or to frighten\nsome bold emigration agent who might have been too loud in his\ndeclamations. But it was already eight o’clock and Bjarne was not yet to\nbe seen. The night was dark and stormy; a cold sleet fiercely lashed the\nwindow-panes, and the wind roared in the chimney. Grimhild, the younger\nsister, ran restlessly out and in and slammed the doors after her. Brita\nsat tightly pressed up against the wall in the darkest corner of the\nroom. Every time the wind shook the house she started up; then again\nseated herself and shuddered. Dark forebodings filled her soul.\n\nAt last,--the clock had just struck ten,--there was a noise heard in\nthe outer hall. Grimhild sprang to the door and tore it open. A tall,\nstooping figure entered, and by the dress she at once recognized her\nfather.\n\n“Good God,” cried she, and ran up to him.\n\n“Go away, child,” muttered he, in a voice that sounded strangely\nunfamiliar, and he pushed her roughly away. For a moment he stood still,\nthen stalked up to the table, and, with a heavy thump, dropped down into\na chair. There he remained with his elbows resting on his knees, and\nabsently staring on the floor. His long hair hung in wet tangles down\nover his face, and the wrinkles about his mouth seemed deeper and\nfiercer than usual. Now and then he sighed, or gave vent to a deep\ngroan. In a while his eyes began to wander uneasily about the room; and\nas they reached the corner where Brita was sitting, he suddenly darted\nup, as if stung by something poisonous, seized a brand from the hearth,\nand rushed toward her.\n\n“Tell me I did not see it,” he broke forth, in a hoarse whisper, seizing\nher by the arm and thrusting the burning brand close up to her face.\n“Tell me it is a lie--a black, poisonous lie.”\n\nShe raised her eyes slowly to his and gazed steadfastly into his face.\n“Ah,” he continued in the same terrible voice, “it was what I told\nthem down there at the church--a lie--an infernal lie. And I drew\nblood--blood, I say--I did--from the slanderer. Ha, ha, ha! What a lusty\nsprawl that was!”\n\nThe color came and departed from Brita’s cheeks. And still she was\nstrangely self possessed. She even wondered at her own calmness. Alas,\nshe did not know that it was a calmness that is more terrible than pain,\nthe corpse of a forlorn and hopeless heart.\n\n“Child,” continued Bjarne, and his voice assumed a more natural tone,\n“why dost thou not speak? They have lied about thee, child, because thou\nart fair, they have envied thee.” Then, almost imploringly, “Open thy\nmouth, Brita, and tell thy father that thou art pure--pure as the snow,\nchild--my own--my beautiful child.”\n\nThere was a long and painful pause, in which the crackling of the brand,\nand the heavy breathing of the old man were the only sounds to break\nthe silence. Pale like a marble image stood she before him; no word\nof excuse, no prayer for forgiveness escaped her; only a convulsive\nquivering of the lips betrayed the life that struggled within her. With\nevery moment the hope died in Bjarne’s bosom. His visage was fearful to\nbehold. Terror and fierce indomitable hatred had grimly distorted his\nfeatures, and his eyes burned like fire-coals beneath his bushy brows.\n\n“Harlot,” he shrieked, “harlot!”\n\nA cold gust of wind swept through the room. The windows shook, the doors\nflew open, as if touched by a strong invisible hand--and the old man\nstood alone, holding the flickering brand above his head.\n\nIt was after midnight, the wind had abated, but the snow still fell,\nthick and silent, burying paths and fences under its cold white mantle.\nOnward she fled--onward and ever onward. And whither, she knew not.\nA cold numbness had chilled her senses, but still her feet drove her\nirresistibly onward. A dark current seemed to have seized her, she only\nfelt that she was adrift, and she cared not whither it bore her. In\nspite of the stifling dullness which oppressed her, her body seemed as\nlight as air. At last,--she knew not where,--she heard the roar of the\nsea resounding in her ears, a genial warmth thawed the numbness of\nher senses, and she floated joyfully among the clouds--among golden,\nsun-bathed clouds. When she opened her eyes, she found herself lying\nin a comfortable bed, and a young woman with a kind motherly face was\nsitting at her side. It was all like a dream, and she made no effort to\naccount for what appeared so strange and unaccountable.\n\nWhat she afterward heard was that a fisherman had found her in a\nsnow-drift on the strand, and that he had carried her home to his\ncottage and had given her over to the charge of his wife. This was the\nsecond day since her arrival. They knew who she was, but had kept the\ndoors locked and had told no one that she was there. She heard the story\nof the good woman without emotion; it seemed an intolerable effort\nto think. But on the third day, when her child was born, her mind was\nsuddenly aroused from its lethargy, and she calmly matured her plans;\nand for the child’s sake she resolved to live and to act. That same\nevening there came a little boy with a bundle for her. She opened it and\nfound therein the clothes she had left behind, and--her brooches. She\nknew that it was her sister who had sent them; then there was one who\nstill thought of her with affection. And yet her first impulse was to\nsend it all back, or to throw it into the ocean; but she looked at her\nchild and forbore.\n\nA week passed, and Brita recovered. Of Halvard she had heard nothing.\nOne night, as she lay in a half doze, she thought she had Seen a pale,\nfrightened face pressed up against the window-pane, and staring fixedly\nat her and her child; but, after all, it might have been merely a dream.\nFor her fevered fancy had in these last days frequently beguiled her\ninto similar visions. She often thought of him, but, strangely enough,\nno more with bitterness, but with pity. Had he been strong enough to be\nwicked, she could have hated him, but he was weak, and she pitied him.\nThen it was that; one evening, as she heard that the American vessel was\nto sail at daybreak, she took her little boy and wrapped him carefully\nin her own clothes, bade farewell to the good fisherman and his wife,\nand walked alone down to the strand. Huge clouds of fantastic shapes\nchased each other desperately along the horizon, and now and then the\nslender new moon glanced forth from the deep blue gulfs between. She\nchose a boat at random and was about to unmoor it, when she saw the\nfigure of a man tread carefully over the stones and hesitatingly\napproach her.\n\n“Brita,” came in a whisper from the strand.\n\n“Who’s there?”\n\n“It is I. Father knows it all, and he has nearly killed me; and mother,\ntoo.”\n\n“Is that what you have come to tell me?”\n\n“No, I would like to help you some. I have been trying to see you these\nmany days.” And he stepped close up to the boat.\n\n“Thank you; I need no help.”\n\n“But, Brita,” implored he, “I have sold my gun and my dog, and\neverything I had, and this is what I have got for it.” He stretched out\nhis hand and reached her a red handkerchief with something heavy bound\nup in a corner. She took it mechanically, held it in her hand for\na moment, then flung it far out into the water. A smile of profound\ncontempt and pity passed over her countenance.\n\n“Farewell, Halvard,” said she, calmly, and pushed the boat into the\nwater.\n\n“But, Brita,” cried he, in despair, “what would you have me do?”\n\nShe lifted the child in her arms, then pointed to the vacant seat at\nher side. He understood what she meant, and stood for a moment wavering.\nSuddenly, he covered his face with his hands and burst into tears.\nWithin half an hour, Brita boarded the vessel, and as the first red\nstripe of the dawn illumined the horizon, the wind filled the sails, and\nthe ship glided westward toward that land where there is a home for them\nwhom love and misfortune have exiled.\n\nIt was a long and wearisome voyage. There was an old English clergyman\non board, who collected curiosities; to him she sold her rings and\nbrooches, and thereby obtained more than sufficient money to pay her\npassage. She hardly spoke to any one except her child. Those of her\nfellow-parishioners who knew her, and perhaps guessed her history, kept\naloof from her, and she was grateful to them that they did. From morning\ntill night, she sat in a corner between a pile of deck freight and the\nkitchen skylight, and gazed at her little boy who was lying in her lap.\nAll her hopes, her future, and her life were in him. For herself, she\nhad ceased to hope.\n\n“I can give thee no fatherland, my child,” she said to him. “Thou shalt\nnever know the name of him who gave thee life. Thou and I, we shall\nstruggle together, and, as true as there is a God above, who sees us,\nHe will not leave either of us to perish. But let us ask no questions,\nchild, about that which is past. Thou shalt grow and be strong, and thy\nmother must grow with thee.”\n\nDuring the third week of the voyage, the English clergyman baptized the\nboy, and she called him Thomas, after the day in the almanac on which he\nwas born. He should never know that Norway had been his mother’s home;\ntherefore she would give him no name which might betray his race. One\nmorning, early in the month of June, they hailed land, and the great New\nWorld lay before them.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWhy should I speak of the ceaseless care, the suffering, and the hard\ntoil, which made the first few months of Brita’s life on this continent\na mere continued struggle for existence? They are familiar to every\nemigrant who has come here with a brave heart and an empty purse.\nSuffice it to say that at the end of the second month, she succeeded in\nobtaining service as milkmaid with a family in the neighborhood of\nNew York. With the linguistic talent peculiar to her people, she\nsoon learned the English language and even spoke it well. From her\ncountrymen, she kept as far away as possible, not for her own sake,\nbut for that of her boy; for he was to grow great and strong, and the\nknowledge of his birth might shatter his strength and break his courage.\nFor the same reason she also exchanged her picturesque Norse costume for\nthat of the people among whom she was living. She went commonly by the\nname of Mrs. Brita, which pronounced in the English way, sounded very\nmuch like Mrs. Bright, and this at last became the name by which she was\nknown in the neighborhood.\n\nThus five years passed; then there was a great rage for emigrating to\nthe far West, and Brita, with many others, started for Chicago. There\nshe arrived in the year 1852, and took up her lodgings with an Irish\nwidow, who was living in a little cottage in what was then termed the\noutskirts of the city. Those who saw her in those days, going about the\nlumber-yards and doing a man’s work, would hardly have recognized in her\nthe merry Glitter-Brita, who in times of old trod the spring-dance so\ngayly in the well-lighted halls of the Blakstad mansion. And, indeed,\nshe was sadly changed! Her features had become sharper, and the firm\nlines about her mouth expressed severity, almost sternness. Her clear\nblue eyes seemed to have grown larger, and their glance betrayed secret,\never-watchful care. Only her yellow hair had resisted the force of time\nand sorrow; for it still fell in rich and wavy folds over a smooth white\nforehead. She was, indeed, half ashamed of it, and often took pains to\nforce it into a sober, matronly hood. Only at nights, when she sat alone\ntalking with her boy, she would allow it to escape from its prison; and\nhe would laugh and play with it, and in his child’s way even wonder at\nthe contrast between her stern face and her youthful maidenly tresses.\n\nThis Thomas, her son, was a strange child. He had a Norseman’s taste for\nthe fabulous and fantastic, and although he never heard a tale of Necken\nor the Hulder, he would often startle his mother by the most fanciful\ncombinations of imagined events, and by bolder personifications than\never sprung from the legendary soil of the Norseland. She always took\ncare to check him whenever he indulged in these imaginary flights, and\nhe at last came to look upon them as something wrong and sinful. The\nboy, as he grew up, often strikingly reminded her of her father,\nas, indeed, he seemed to have inherited more from her own than from\nHalvard’s race. Only the bright flaxen hair and his square, somewhat\nclumsy stature might have told him to be the latter’s child. He had a\nhot temper, and often distressed his mother by his stubbornness; and\nthen there would come a great burst of repentance afterwards, which\ndistressed her still more. For she was afraid it might be a sign of\nweakness. “And strong he must be,” said she to herself, “strong enough\nto overcome all resistance, and to conquer a great name for himself,\nstrong enough to bless a mother who brought him into the world\nnameless.”\n\nStrange to say, much as she loved this child, she seldom caressed him.\nIt was a penance she had imposed upon herself to atone for her guilt.\nOnly at times, when she had been sitting up late, and her eyes would\nfall, as it were, by accident upon the little face on the pillow,\nwith the sweet unconsciousness of sleep resting upon it like a soft,\ninvisible veil, would she suddenly throw herself down over him, kiss\nhim, and whisper tender names in his ear, while her tears fell hot and\nfast on his yellow hair and his rosy countenance. Then the child would\ndream that he was sailing aloft over shining forests, and that his\nmother, beaming with all the beauty of her lost youth, flew before him,\nshowering golden flowers on his path. These were the happiest moments of\nBrita’s joyless life, and even these were not unmixed with bitterness;\nfor into the midst of her joy would steal a shy anxious thought which\nwas the more terrible because it came so stealthily, so soft-footed\nand unbidden. Had not this child been given her as a punishment for her\nguilt? Had she then a right to turn God’s scourge into a blessing? Did\nshe give to God “that which belongeth unto God,” as long as all her\nhopes, her thoughts, and her whole being revolved about this one earthly\nthing, her son, the child of her sorrow? She was not a nature to shrink\nfrom grave questions; no, she met them boldly, when once they were\nthere, wrestled fiercely with them, was defeated, and again with a\nmartyr’s zeal rose to renew the combat. God had Himself sent her this\nperplexing doubt and it was her duty to bear His burden. Thus ran\nBrita’s reasoning. In the mean while the years slipped by, and great\nchanges were wrought in the world about her.\n\nThe few hundred dollars which Brita had been able to save, during the\nfirst three years of her stay in Chicago, she had invested in a piece of\nland. In the mean while the city had grown, and in the year 1859 she was\noffered five thousand dollars for her lot; this offer she accepted and\nagain bought a small piece of property at a short distance from the\ncity. The boy had since his eighth year attended the public school, and\nhad made astonishing progress. Every day when school was out, she would\nmeet him at the gate, take him by the hand and lead him home. If any\nof the other boys dared to make sport of her, or to tease him for his\ndependence upon her, it was sure to cost that boy a black eye{.} He soon\nsucceeded in establishing himself in the respect of his school-mates,\nfor he was the strongest boy of his own age, and ever ready to protect\nand defend the weak and defenseless. When Thomas Bright (for that was\nthe name by which he was known) was fifteen years old he was offered\na position as clerk in the office of a lumber-merchant, and with his\nmother’s consent he accepted it. He was a fine young lad now, large and\nwell-knit, and with a clear earnest countenance. In the evening he would\nbring home books to read, and as it had always been Brita’s habit to\ninterest herself in whatever interested him, she soon found herself\nstudying and discussing with him things which had in former years been\nfar beyond the horizon of her mind. She had at his request reluctantly\ngiven up her work in the lumber-yards, and now spent her days at home,\nbusying herself with sewing and reading and such other things as women\nfind to fill up a vacant hour.\n\nOne evening, when Thomas was in his nineteenth year, he returned\nfrom his office with a graver face than usual. His mother’s quick eye\nimmediately saw that something had agitated him, but she forbore to ask.\n\n“Mother,” said he at last, “who is my father? Is he dead or alive?”\n\n“God is your father, my son,” answered she, tremblingly. “If you love\nme, ask me no more.”\n\n“I do love you, mother,” he said, and gave her a grave look, in which\nshe thought she detected a mingling of tenderness and reproach. “And it\nshall be as you have said.”\n\nIt was the first time she had had reason to blush before him, and\nher emotion came near overwhelming her; but with a violent effort she\nstifled it, and remained outwardly calm. He began pacing up and down the\nfloor with his head bent and his hands on his back. It suddenly occurred\nto her that he was a grown man, and that she could no longer hold the\nsame relation to him as his supporter and protector. “Alas,” thought\nshe, “if God will but let me remain his mother, I shall bless and thank\nHim.”\n\nIt was the first time this subject had been broached, and it gave rise\nto many a doubt and many a question in the anxious mother’s mind. Had\nshe been right in concealing from him that which he might justly claim\nto know? What had been her motive in keeping him ignorant of his origin\nand of the land of his birth? She had wished him to grow to the strength\nof manhood, unconscious of guilt, so that he might bear his head\nupright, and look the world fearlessly in the face. And still, had there\nnot in all this been a lurking thought of herself, a fear of losing his\nlove, a desire to stand pure and perfect in his eye? She hardly dared\nto answer these questions, for, alas, she knew not that even our purest\nmotives are but poorly able to bear a searching scrutiny. She began to\nsuspect that her whole course with her son had been wrong from the very\nbeginning. Why had she not told him the stern truth, even if he should\ndespise her for it, even if she should have to stand a blushing culprit\nin his presence? Often, when she heard his footsteps in the hall, as\nhe returned from the work of the day, she would man herself up and the\nwords hovered upon her lips: “Son, thou art a bastard born, a child of\nguilt, and thy mother is an outcast upon the earth.” But when she met\nthose calm blue eyes of his, saw the unsuspecting frankness of his\nmanner and the hopefulness with which he looked to the future, her\nwomanly heart shrank from its duty, and she hastened out of the room,\nthrew herself on her bed, and wept. Fiercely she wrestled with God in\nprayer, until she thought that even God had deserted her. Thus months\npassed and years, and the constant care and anxiety began to affect her\nhealth. She grew pale and nervous, and the slightest noise would annoy\nher. In the mean while, her manner toward the young man had become\nstrangely altered, and he soon noticed it, although he forbore to speak.\nShe was scrupulously mindful of his comfort, anxiously anticipated his\nwants, and observed toward him an ever vigilant consideration, as if he\nhad been her master instead of her son.\n\nWhen Thomas was twenty-two years of age, he was offered a partnership in\nhis employer’s business, and with every year his prospects brightened.\nThe sale of his mother’s property brought him a very handsome little\nfortune, which enabled him to build a fine and comfortable house in one\nof the best portions of the city. Thus their outward circumstances were\ngreatly improved, and of comfort and luxury Brita had all and more than\nshe had ever desired; but her health was broken down, and the physicians\ndeclared that a year of foreign travel and a continued residence in\nItaly might possibly restore her. At last, Thomas, too, began to urge\nher, until she finally yielded. It was on a bright morning in May that\nthey both started for New York, and three days later they took the boat\nfor Europe. What countries they were to visit they had hardly decided,\nbut after a brief stay in England we find them again on a steamer bound\nfor Norway.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nWarm and gentle as it is, June often comes to the fjord-valleys of\nNorway with the voice and the strength of a giant. The glaciers\ntotter and groan, as if in anger at their own weakness, and send huge\navalanches of stones and ice down into the valleys. The rivers swell and\nrush with vociferous brawl out over the mountainsides, and a thousand\ntiny brooks join in the general clamor, and dance with noisy chatter\nover the moss-grown birch-roots. But later, when the struggle is at an\nend, and June has victoriously seated herself upon her throne, her voice\nbecomes more richly subdued and brings rest and comfort to the ear and\nto the troubled heart. It was while the month was in this latter mood\nthat Brita and her son entered once more the valley whence, twenty-five\nyears ago, they had fled. Many strange, turbulent emotions stirred the\nmother’s bosom, as she saw again the great snow-capped mountains, and\nthe calm, green valley, her childhood’s home, lying so snugly sheltered\nin their mighty embrace. Even Thomas’s breast was moved with vaguely\nsympathetic throbs, as this wondrous scene spread itself before him.\nThey soon succeeded in hiring a farm-house, about half an hour’s walk\nfrom Blakstad, and, according to Brita’s wish, established themselves\nthere for the summer. She had known the people well, when she was young,\nbut they never thought of identifying her with the merry maid, who had\nonce startled the parish by her sudden flight; and she, although she\nlonged to open her heart to them, let no word fall to betray her real\ncharacter. Her conscience accused her of playing a false part, but for\nher son’s sake she kept silent.\n\nThen, one day,--it was the second Sunday after their arrival,--she rose\nearly in the morning, and asked Thomas to accompany her on a walk up\nthrough the valley. There was Sabbath in the air; the soft breath of\nsummer, laden with the perfume of fresh leaves and field-flowers,\ngently wafted into their faces. The sun glittered in the dewy grass, the\ncrickets sung with a remote voice of wonder, and the air seemed to be\nhalf visible, and moved in trembling wavelets on the path before them.\nResting on her son’s arm, Brita walked slowly up through the flowering\nmeadows; she hardly knew whither her feet bore her, but her heart\nbeat violently, and she often was obliged to pause and press her hands\nagainst her bosom, as if to stay the turbulent emotions.\n\n“You are not well, mother,” said the son. “It was imprudent in me to\nallow you to exert yourself in this way.”\n\n“Let us sit down on this stone,” answered she. “I shall soon be better.\nDo not look so anxiously at me. Indeed, I am not sick.”\n\nHe spread his light summer coat on the stone and carefully seated her.\nShe lifted her veil and raised her eyes to the large red-roofed mansion,\nwhose dark outlines drew themselves dimly on the dusky background of the\npine forest. Was he still alive, he whose life-hope she had wrecked, he\nwho had once driven her out into the night with all but a curse upon his\nlips? How would he receive her, if she were to return? Ah, she knew him,\nand she trembled at the very thought of meeting him. But was not the\nguilt hers? Could she depart from this valley, could she die in peace,\nwithout having thrown herself at his feet and implored his forgiveness?\nAnd there, on the opposite side of the valley, lay the home of him who\nhad been the cause of all her misery. What had been his fate, and did he\nstill remember those long happy summer days, ah! so long, long ago? She\nhad dared to ask no questions of the people with whom she lived, but\nnow a sudden weakness had overtaken her, and she felt that to-day must\ndecide her fate; she could no longer bear this torture of uncertainty.\nThomas remained standing at her side and looked at her with anxiety\nand wonder. He knew that she had concealed many things from him, but\nwhatever her reasons might be, he was confident that they were just and\nweighty. It was not for him to question her about what he might have no\nright to know. He felt as if he had never loved her as in this\nmoment, when she seemed to be most in need of him, and an overwhelming\ntenderness took possession of his heart. He suddenly stooped down, took\nher pale, thin face between his hands and kissed her. The long pent-up\nemotion burst forth in a flood of tears; she buried her face in her lap\nand wept long and silently. Then the church-bells began to peal down in\nthe valley, and the slow mighty sound floated calmly and solemnly up to\nthem. How many long-forgotten memories of childhood and youth did\nthey not wake in her bosom--memories of the time when the merry\nGlitter-Brita, decked with her shining brooches, wended her way to the\nchurch among the gayly-dressed lads and maidens of the parish?\n\nA cluster of white-stemmed birches threw its shadow over the stone where\nthe penitent mother was sitting, and the tall grass on both sides of\nthe path nearly hid her from sight. Presently the church-folk began to\nappear, and Brita raised her head and drew her veil down over her face.\nNo one passed without greeting the strangers, and the women and maidens,\naccording to old fashion, stopped and courtesied. At last, there came\nan old white-haired man, leaning on the arm of a middle-aged woman. His\nwhole figure was bent forward, and he often stopped and drew his breath\nheavily.\n\n“Oh, yes, yes,” he said, ill a hoarse, broken voice, as he passed before\nthem, “age is gaining on me fast. I can’t move about any more as of old.\nBut to church I must this day. God help me! I have done much wrong and\nneed to pray for forgiveness.”\n\n“You had better sit down and rest, father,” said the woman. “Here is a\nstone, and the fine lady, I am sure, will allow a weak old man to sit\ndown beside her.”\n\nThomas rose and made a sign to the old man to take his seat.\n\n“O yes, yes,” he went on murmuring, as if talking to himself. “Much\nwrong--much forgiveness. God help us all--miserable sinners. He who\nhateth not father and mother--and daughter is not worthy of me. O,\nyes--yes--God comfort us all. Help me up, Grimhild. I think I can move\non again, now.”\n\nThomas, of course, did not understand a word of what he said, but seeing\nthat he wished to rise, he willingly offered his assistance, supported\nhis arm and raised him.\n\n“Thanks to you, young man,” said the peasant. “And may God reward your\nkindness.”\n\nAnd the two, father and daughter, moved on, slowly and laboriously, as\nthey had come. Thomas stood following them with his eyes, until a low,\nhalf-stifled moan suddenly called him to his mother’s side. Her frame\ntrembled violently.\n\n“Mother, mother,” implored he, stooping over her, “what has happened?\nWhy are you no more yourself?”\n\n“Ah, my son, I can bear it no longer,” sobbed she. “God forgive me--thou\nmust know it all.”\n\nHe sat down at her side and drew her closely up to him and she hid her\nface on his bosom. There was a long silence, only broken by the loud\nchirruping of the crickets.\n\n“My son,” she began at last, still hiding her face, “thou art a child of\nguilt.”\n\n“That has been no secret to me, mother,” answered he, gravely and\ntenderly, “since I was old enough to know what guilt was.”\n\nShe quickly raised her head, and a look of amazement, of joyous\nsurprise, shone through the tears that veiled her eyes. She could read\nnothing but filial love and confidence in those grave, manly features,\nand she saw in that moment that all her doubts had been groundless, that\nher long prayerful struggle had been for naught.\n\n“I brought thee into the world nameless,” she whispered, “and thou hast\nno word of reproach for me?”\n\n“With God’s help, I am strong enough to conquer a name for myself,\nmother,” was his answer.\n\nIt was the very words of her own secret wish, and upon his lips they\nsounded like a blessed assurance, like a miraculous fulfillment of her\nmotherly prayer.\n\n“Still, another thing, my child,” she went on in a more confident voice.\n“This is thy native land,--and the old man who was just sitting here at\nmy side was--my father.”\n\nAnd there, in the shadow of the birch-trees, in the summer stillness of\nthat hour, she told him the story of her love, of her flight, and of the\nmisery of these long, toilsome five and twenty years.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Brita and her son were seen returning to\nthe farm-house. A calm, subdued happiness beamed from the mother’s\ncountenance; she was again at peace with the world and herself, and her\nheart was as light as in the days of her early youth. But her bodily\nstrength had given out, and her limbs almost refused to support her. The\nstrain upon her nerves and the constant effort had hitherto enabled\nher to keep up, but now, when that strain was removed, exhausted nature\nclaimed its right. The next day--she could not leave her bed, and\nwith every hour her strength failed. A physician was sent for. He gave\nmedicine, but no hope. He shook his head gravely, as he went, and both\nmother and son knew what that meant.\n\nToward evening, Bjarne Blakstad was summoned, and came at once. Thomas\nleft the room, as the old man entered, and what passed in that hour\nbetween father and daughter, only God knows. When the door was again\nopened, Brita’s eyes shone with a strange brilliancy, and Bjarne lay on\nhis knees before the bed, pressing her hand convulsively between both of\nhis.\n\n“This is my son, father,” said she, in a language which her son did not\nunderstand; and a faint smile of motherly pride and happiness flitted\nover her pale features. “I would give him to thee in return for what\nthou hast lost; but God has laid his future in another land.”\n\nBjarne rose, grasped his grandson’s hand, and pressed it; and two heavy\ntears ran down his furrowed cheeks. “Alas,” murmured he, “my son, that\nwe should meet thus.”\n\nThere they stood, bound together by the bonds of blood, but, alas, there\nlay a world between them.\n\nAll night they sat together at the dying woman’s bedside. Not a word\nwas spoken. Toward morning, as the sun stole into the darkened chamber,\nBrita murmured their names, and they laid their hands in hers.\n\n“God be praised,” whispered she, scarcely audibly, “I have found you\nboth--my father and my son.” A deep pallor spread over her countenance.\nShe was dead.\n\nTwo days later, when the body was laid out, Thomas stood alone in the\nroom. The windows were covered with white sheets, and a subdued light\nfell upon the pale, lifeless countenance. Death had dealt gently with\nher, she seemed younger than before, and her light wavy hair fell softly\nover the white forehead. Then there came a middle-aged man, with a dull\neye, and a broad forehead, and timidly approached the lonely mourner.\nHe walked on tip-toe and his figure stooped heavily. For a long while\nhe stood gazing at the dead body, then he knelt down at the foot of the\ncoffin, and began to sob violently. At last he arose, took two steps\ntoward the young man, paused again, and departed silently as he had\ncome. It was Halvard.\n\nClose under the wall of the little red-painted church, they dug the\ngrave; and a week later her father was laid to rest at his daughter’s\nside.\n\nBut the fresh winds blew over the Atlantic and beckoned the son to new\nfields of labor in the great land of the future.\n\n\n\n\nA GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.\n\nRALPH GRIM was born a gentleman. He had the misfortune of coming into\nthe world some ten years later than might reasonably have been expected.\nColonel Grim and his lady had celebrated twelve anniversaries of their\nwedding-day, and had given up all hopes of ever having a son and heir,\nwhen this late-comer startled them by his unexpected appearance. The\nonly previous addition to the family had been a daughter, and she was\nthen ten summers old.\n\nRalph was a very feeble child, and could only with great difficulty be\npersuaded to retain his hold of the slender thread which bound him to\nexistence. He was rubbed with whisky, and wrapped in cotton, and given\nmare’s milk to drink, and God knows what not, and the Colonel swore a\nround oath of paternal delight when at last the infant stopped gasping\nin that distressing way and began to breathe like other human beings.\nThe mother, who, in spite of her anxiety for the child’s life, had found\ntime to plot for him a career of future magnificence, now suddenly set\nhim apart for literature, because that was the easiest road to fame, and\ndisposed of him in marriage to one of the most distinguished families of\nthe land. She cautiously suggested this to her husband when he came to\ntake his seat at her bedside; but to her utter astonishment she found\nthat he had been indulging a similar train of thought, and had already\ndestined the infant prodigy for the army. She, however, could not give\nup her predilection for literature, and the Colonel, who could not bear\nto be contradicted in his own house, as he used to say, was getting\nevery minute louder and more flushed, when, happily, the doctor’s\narrival interrupted the dispute.\n\nAs Ralph grew up from infancy to childhood, he began to give decided\npromise of future distinction. He was fond of sitting down in a corner\nand sucking his thumb, which his mother interpreted as the sign of that\nbrooding disposition peculiar to poets and men of lofty genius. At the\nage of five, he had become sole master in the house. He slapped his\nsister Hilda in the face, or pulled her hair, when she hesitated to\nobey him, tyrannized over his nurse, and sternly refused to go to bed in\nspite of his mother’s entreaties. On such occasions, the Colonel would\nhide his face behind his newspaper, and chuckle with delight; it was\nevident that nature had intended his son for a great military commander.\nAs soon as Ralph himself was old enough to have any thoughts about his\nfuture destiny, he made up his mind that he would like to be a pirate.\nA few months later, having contracted an immoderate taste for candy, he\ncontented himself with the comparatively humble position of a baker; but\nwhen he had read “Robinson Crusoe,” he manifested a strong desire to go\nto sea in the hope of being wrecked on some desolate island. The parents\nspent long evenings gravely discussing these indications of uncommon\ngenius, and each interpreted them in his or her own way.\n\n“He is not like any other child I ever knew,” said the mother.\n\n“To be sure,” responded the father, earnestly. “He is a most\nextraordinary child. I was a very remarkable child too, even if I do say\nit myself; but, as far as I remember, I never aspired to being wrecked\non an uninhabited is land.”\n\nThe Colonel probably spoke the truth; but he forgot to take into account\nthat he had never read “Robinson Crusoe.”\n\nOf Ralph’s school-days there is but little to report, for, to tell the\ntruth, he did not fancy going to school, as the discipline annoyed him.\nThe day after his having entered the gymnasium, which was to prepare\nhim for the Military Academy, the principal saw him waiting at the gate\nafter his class had been dismissed. He approached him, and asked why he\ndid not go home with the rest.\n\n“I am waiting for the servant to carry my books,” was the boy’s answer.\n\n“Give me your books,” said the teacher.\n\nRalph reluctantly obeyed. That day the Colonel was not a little\nsurprised to see his son marching up the street, and every now and then\nglancing behind him with a look of discomfort at the principal, who\nwas following quietly in his train, carrying a parcel of school-books.\nColonel Grim and his wife, divining the teacher’s intention, agreed that\nit was a great outrage, but they did not mention the matter to Ralph.\nHenceforth, however, the boy refused to be accompanied by his servant. A\nweek later he was impudent to the teacher of gymnastics, who whipped him\nin return. The Colonel’s rage knew no bounds; he rode in great haste to\nthe gymnasium, reviled the teacher for presuming to chastise HIS son,\nand committed the boy to the care of a private tutor.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, Ralph went to the capital with the intention of\nentering the Military Academy. He was a tall, handsome youth, slender of\nstature, and carried himself as erect as a candle. He had a light, clear\ncomplexion of almost feminine delicacy; blonde, curly hair, which he\nalways kept carefully brushed; a low forehead, and a straight, finely\nmodeled nose. There was an expression of extreme sensitiveness about\nthe nostrils, and a look of indolence in the dark-blue eyes. But the\nensemble of his features was pleasing, his dress irreproachable, and his\nmanners bore no trace of the awkward self-consciousness peculiar to his\nage. Immediately on his arrival in the capital he hired a suite of\nrooms in the aristocratic part of the city, and furnished them rather\nexpensively, but in excellent taste. From a bosom friend, whom he met\nby accident in the restaurant’s pavilion in the park, he learned that\na pair of antlers, a stuffed eagle, or falcon, and a couple of swords,\nwere indispensable to a well-appointed apartment. He accordingly bought\nthese articles at a curiosity-shop. During the first weeks of his\nresidence in the city he made some feeble efforts to perfect himself in\nmathematics, in which he suspected he was somewhat deficient. But when\nthe same officious friend laughed at him, and called him “green,” he\ndetermined to trust to fortune, and henceforth devoted himself the\nmore assiduously to the French ballet, where he had already made some\ninteresting acquaintances.\n\nThe time for the examination came; the French ballet did not prove a\ngood preparation; Ralph failed. It quite shook him for the time, and\nhe felt humiliated. He had not the courage to tell his father; so he\nlingered on from day to day, sat vacantly gazing out of his window, and\ntried vainly to interest himself in the busy bustle down on the street.\nIt provoked him that everybody else should be so light-hearted, when\nhe was, or at least fancied himself, in trouble. The parlor grew\nintolerable; he sought refuge in his bedroom. There he sat one evening\n(it was the third day after the examination), and stared out upon the\ngray stone walls which on all sides enclosed the narrow court-yard.\nThe round stupid face of the moon stood tranquilly dozing like a great\nLimburger cheese suspended under the sky.\n\nRalph, at least, could think of a no more fitting simile. But the\nbright-eyed young girl in the window hard by sent a longing look up to\nthe same moon, and thought of her distant home on the fjords, where the\nglaciers stood like hoary giants, and caught the yellow moonbeams on\ntheir glittering shields of snow. She had been reading “Ivanhoe” all the\nafternoon, until the twilight had overtaken her quite unaware, and\nnow she suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to write her German\nexercise. She lifted her face and saw a pair of sad, vacant eyes, gazing\nat her from the next window in the angle of the court. She was a little\nstartled at first, but in the next moment she thought of her German\nexercise and took heart.\n\n“Do you know German?” she said; then immediately repented that she had\nsaid it.\n\n“I do,” was the answer.\n\nShe took up her apron and began to twist it with an air of\nembarrassment.\n\n“I didn’t mean anything,” she whispered, at last. “I only wanted to\nknow.”\n\n“You are very kind.”\n\nThat answer roused her; he was evidently making sport of her.\n\n“Well, then, if you do, you may write my exercise for me. I have marked\nthe place in the book.”\n\nAnd she flung her book over to his window, and he caught it on the edge\nof the sill, just as it was falling.\n\n“You are a very strange girl,” he remarked, turning over the leaves of\nthe book, although it was too dark to read. “How old are you?”\n\n“I shall be fourteen six weeks before Christmas,” answered she, frankly.\n\n“Then I excuse you.”\n\n“No, indeed,” cried she, vehemently. “You needn’t excuse me at all. If\nyou don’t want to write my exercise, you may send the book back again. I\nam very sorry I spoke to you, and I shall never do it again.”\n\n“But you will not get the book back again without the exercise,” replied\nhe, quietly. “Good-night.”\n\nThe girl stood long looking after him, hoping that he would return.\nThen, with a great burst of repentance, she hid her face in her lap, and\nbegan to cry.\n\n“Oh, dear, I didn’t mean to be rude,” she sobbed. “But it was Ivanhoe\nand Rebecca who upset me.”\n\nThe next morning she was up before daylight, and waited for two long\nhours in great suspense before the curtain of his window was raised. He\ngreeted her politely; threw a hasty glance around the court to see if he\nwas observed, and then tossed her book dexterously over into her hands.\n\n“I have pinned the written exercise to the fly-leaf,” he said. “You will\nprobably have time to copy it before breakfast.”\n\n“I am ever so much obliged to you,” she managed to stammer.\n\nHe looked so tall and handsome, and grown-up, and her remorse stuck in\nher throat, and threatened to choke her. She had taken him for a boy as\nhe sat there in his window the evening before.\n\n“By the way, what is your name?” he asked, carelessly, as he turned to\ngo.\n\n“Bertha.”\n\n“Well, my dear Bertha, I am happy to have made your acquaintance.”\n\nAnd he again made her a polite bow, and entered his parlor.\n\n“How provokingly familiar he is,” thought she; “but no one can deny that\nhe is handsome.”\n\nThe bright roguish face of the young girl haunted Ralph during the whole\nnext week. He had been in love at least ten times before, of course;\nbut, like most boys, with young ladies far older than himself. He found\nhimself frequently glancing over to her window in the hope of catching\nanother glimpse of her face; but the curtain was always drawn down,\nand Bertha remained invisible. During the second week, however, she\nrelented, and they had many a pleasant chat together. He now volunteered\nto write all her exercises, and she made no objections. He learned that\nshe was the daughter of a well-to-do peasant in the sea-districts of\nNorway (and it gave him quite a shock to hear it), and that she was\ngoing to school in the city, and boarded with an old lady who kept a\npension in the house adjoining the one in which he lived.\n\nOne day in the autumn Ralph was surprised by the sudden arrival of his\nfather, and the fact of his failure in the examination could no longer\nbe kept a secret. The old Colonel flared up at once when Ralph made\nhis confession; the large veins upon his forehead swelled; he grew\ncoppery-red in his face, and stormed up and down the floor, until his\nson became seriously alarmed; but, to his great relief, he was soon made\naware that his father’s wrath was not turned against him personally, but\nagainst the officials of the Military Academy who had rejected him. The\nColonel took it as an insult to his own good name and irreproachable\nstanding as an officer; he promptly refused any other explanation, and\nvainly racked his brain to remember if any youthful folly of his could\npossibly have made him enemies among the teachers of the Academy. He\nat last felt satisfied that it was envy of his own greatness and rapid\nadvancement which had induced the rascals to take vengeance on his son.\nRalph reluctantly followed his father back to the country town where\nthe latter was stationed, and the fair-haired Bertha vanished from his\nhorizon. His mother’s wish now prevailed, and he began, in his own easy\nway, to prepare himself for the University. He had little taste for\nCicero, and still less for Virgil, but with the use of a “pony” he soon\ngained sufficient knowledge of these authors to be able to talk in a\nsort of patronizing way about them, to the great delight of his fond\nparents. He took quite a fancy, however, to the ode in Horace ending\nwith the lines:\n\n Dulce ridentem,\n Dulce loquentem,\n Lalagen amabo.\n\nAnd in his thought he substituted for Lalage the fair-haired Bertha,\nquite regardless of the requirements of the metre.\n\nTo make a long story short, three years later Ralph returned to the\ncapital, and, after having worn out several tutors, actually succeeded\nin entering the University.\n\nThe first year of college life is a happy time to every young man, and\nRalph enjoyed its processions, its parliamentary gatherings, and\nits leisure, as well as the rest. He was certainly not the man to be\nsentimental over the loss of a young girl whom, moreover, he had only\nknown for a few weeks. Nevertheless, he thought of her at odd times, but\nnot enough to disturb his pleasure. The standing of his family, his own\nhandsome appearance, and his immaculate linen opened to him the best\nhouses of the city, and he became a great favorite in society. At\nlectures he was seldom seen, but more frequently in the theatres, where\nhe used to come in during the middle of the first act, take his station\nin front of the orchestra box, and eye, through his lorgnettes, by\nturns, the actresses and the ladies of the parquet.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nTwo months passed, and then came the great annual ball which the\nstudents give at the opening of the second semester. Ralph was a man of\nimportance that evening; first, because he belonged to a great family;\nsecondly, because he was the handsomest man of his year. He wore a large\ngolden star on his breast (for his fellow-students had made him a Knight\nof the Golden Boar), and a badge of colored ribbons in his button-hole.\n\nThe ball was a brilliant affair, and everybody was in excellent spirits,\nespecially the ladies. Ralph danced incessantly, twirled his soft\nmustache, and uttered amiable platitudes. It was toward midnight, just\nas the company was moving out to supper, that he caught the glance of a\npair of dark-blue eyes, which suddenly drove the blood to his cheeks\nand hastened the beating of his heart. But when he looked once more the\ndark-blue eyes were gone, and his unruly heart went on hammering against\nhis side. He laid his hand on his breast and glanced furtively at his\nfair neighbor, but she looked happy and unconcerned, for the flavor of\nthe ice-cream was delicious. It seemed an endless meal, but, when it\nwas done, Ralph rose, led his partner back to the ball-room, and hastily\nexcused himself. His glance wandered round the wide hall, seeking the\nwell-remembered eyes once more, and, at length, finding them in a remote\ncorner, half hid behind a moving wall of promenaders. In another moment\nhe was at Bertha’s side.\n\n“You must have been purposely hiding yourself, Miss Bertha,” said he,\nwhen the usual greetings were exchanged. “I have not caught a glimpse of\nyou all this evening, until a few moments ago.”\n\n“But I have seen you all the while,” answered the girl, frankly. “I knew\nyou at once as I entered the hall.”\n\n“If I had but known that you were here,” resumed Ralph, as it were,\ninvisibly expanding with an agreeable sense of dignity, “I assure you,\nyou would have been the very first one I should have sought.”\n\nShe raised her large grave eyes to his, as if questioning his sincerity;\nbut she made no answer.\n\n“Good gracious!” thought Ralph. “She takes things terribly in earnest.”\n\n“You look so serious, Miss Bertha,” said he, after a moment’s pause. “I\nremember you as a bright-eyed, flaxen-haired little girl, who threw her\nGerman exercise-book to me across the yard, and whose merry laughter\nstill rings pleasantly in my memory. I confess I don’t find it quite\neasy to identify this grave young lady with my merry friend of three\nyears ago.”\n\n“In other words, you are disappointed at not finding me the same as I\nused to be.”\n\n“No, not exactly that; but--”\n\nRalph paused and looked puzzled. There was something in the earnestness\nof her manner which made a facetious compliment seem grossly\ninappropriate, and in the moment no other escape suggested itself.\n\n“But what?” demanded Bertha, mercilessly.\n\n“Have you ever lost an old friend?” asked he, abruptly.\n\n“Yes; how so?”\n\n“Then,” answered he, while his features lighted up with a happy\ninspiration--“then you will appreciate my situation. I fondly cherished\nmy old picture of you in my memory. Now I have lost it, and I cannot\nhelp regretting the loss. I do not mean, however, to imply that this new\nacquaintance--this second edition of yourself, so to speak--will prove\nless interesting.”\n\nShe again sent him a grave, questioning look, and began to gaze intently\nupon the stone in her bracelet.\n\n“I suppose you will laugh at me,” began she, while a sudden blush\nflitted over her countenance. “But this is my first ball, and I feel\nas if I had rushed into a whirlpool, from which I have, since the first\nrash plunge was made, been vainly trying to escape. I feel so dreadfully\nforlorn. I hardly know anybody here except my cousin, who invited me,\nand I hardly think I know him either.”\n\n“Well, since you are irredeemably committed,” replied Ralph, as the\nmusic, after some prefatory flourishes, broke into the delicious rhythm\nof a Strauss waltz, “then it is no use struggling against fate. Come,\nlet us make the plunge together. Misery loves company.”\n\nHe offered her his arm, and she arose, somewhat hesitatingly, and\nfollowed.\n\n“I am afraid,” she whispered, as they fell into line with the procession\nthat was moving down the long hall, “that you have asked me to dance\nmerely because I said I felt forlorn. If that is the case, I should\nprefer to be led back to my seat.”\n\n“What a base imputation!” cried Ralph.\n\nThere was something so charmingly naïve in this self-depreciation--\nsomething so altogether novel in his experience, and, he could not help\nadding, just a little bit countrified. His spirits rose; he began to\nrelish keenly his position as an experienced man of the world, and, in\nthe agreeable glow of patronage and conscious superiority, chatted with\nhearty ABANDON with his little rustic beauty.\n\n“If your dancing is as perfect as your German exercises were,” said she,\nlaughing, as they swung out upon the floor, “then I promise myself a\ngood deal of pleasure from our meeting.”\n\n“Never fear,” answered he, quickly reversing his step, and whirling with\nmany a capricious turn away among the thronging couples.\n\nWhen Ralph drove home in his carriage toward morning he briefly summed\nup his impressions of Bertha in the following adjectives: intelligent,\ndelightfully unsophisticated, a little bit verdant, but devilish pretty.\n\nSome weeks later Colonel Grim received an appointment at the fortress of\nAggershuus, and immediately took up his residence in the capital. He saw\nthat his son cut a fine figure in the highest circles of society, and\nexpressed his gratification in the most emphatic terms. If he had\nknown, however, that Ralph was in the habit of visiting, with alarming\nregularity, at the house of a plebeian merchant in a somewhat obscure\nstreet, he would, no doubt, have been more chary of his praise. But the\nColonel suspected nothing, and it was well for the peace of the family\nthat he did not. It may have been cowardice in Ralph that he\nnever mentioned Bertha’s name to his family or to his aristocratic\nacquaintances; for, to be candid, he himself felt ashamed of the power\nshe exerted over him, and by turns pitied and ridiculed himself for\npursuing so inglorious a conquest. Nevertheless it wounded his egotism\nthat she never showed any surprise at seeing him, that she received\nhim with a certain frank unceremoniousness, which, however, was very\nbecoming to her; that she invariably went on with her work heedless\nof his presence, and in everything treated him as if she had been his\nequal. She persisted in talking with him in a half sisterly fashion\nabout his studies and his future career, warned him with great\nsolicitude against some of his reprobate friends, of whose merry\nadventures he had told her; and if he ventured to compliment her on\nher beauty or her accomplishments, she would look up gravely from\nher sewing, or answer him in a way which seemed to banish the idea of\nlove-making into the land of the impossible. He was constantly tormented\nby the suspicion that she secretly disapproved of him, and that from a\nmere moral interest in his welfare she was conscientiously laboring\nto make him a better man. Day after day he parted from her feeling\nhumiliated, faint-hearted, and secretly indignant both at himself and\nher, and day after day he returned only to renew the same experience.\nAt last it became too intolerable, he could endure it no longer. Let it\nmake or break, certainty, at all risks, was at least preferable to this\nsickening suspense. That he loved her, he could no longer doubt; let his\nparents foam and fret as much as they pleased; for once he was going to\nstand on his own legs. And in the end, he thought, they would have to\nyield, for they had no son but him.\n\nBertha was going to return to her home on the sea-coast in a week.\nRalph stood in the little low-ceiled parlor, as she imagined, to bid her\ngood-bye. They had been speaking of her father, her brothers, and the\nfarm, and she had expressed the wish that if he ever should come to that\npart of the country he might pay them a visit. Her words had kindled\na vague hope in his breast, but in their very frankness and friendly\nregard there was something which slew the hope they had begotten. He\nheld her hand in his, and her large confiding eyes shone with an emotion\nwhich was beautiful, but was yet not love.\n\n“If you were but a peasant born like myself,” said she, in a voice which\nsounded almost tender, “then I should like to talk to you as I would to\nmy own brother; but--”\n\n“No, not brother, Bertha,” cried he, with sudden vehemence; “I love you\nbetter than I ever loved any earthly being, and if you knew how firmly\nthis love has clutched at the roots of my heart, you would perhaps--you\nwould at least not look so reproachfully at me.”\n\nShe dropped his hand, and stood for a moment silent.\n\n“I am sorry that it should have come to this, Mr. Grim,” said she,\nvisibly struggling for calmness. “And I am perhaps more to blame than\nyou.”\n\n“Blame,” muttered he, “why are you to blame?”\n\n“Because I do not love you; although I sometimes feared that this might\ncome. But then again I persuaded myself that it could not be so.”\n\nHe took a step toward the door, laid his hand on the knob, and gazed\ndown before him.\n\n“Bertha,” began he, slowly, raising his head, “you have always\ndisapproved of me, you have despised me in your heart, but you thought\nyou would be doing a good work if you succeeded in making a man of me.”\n\n“You use strong language,” answered she, hesitatingly; “but there is\ntruth in what you say.”\n\nAgain there was a long pause, in which the ticking of the old parlor\nclock grew louder and louder.\n\n“Then,” he broke out at last, “tell me before we part if I can do\nnothing to gain--I will not say your love--but only your regard? What\nwould you do if you were in my place?”\n\n“My advice you will hardly heed, and I do not even know that it would\nbe well if you did. But if I were a man in your position, I should break\nwith my whole past, start out into the world where nobody knew me, and\nwhere I should be dependent only upon my own strength, and there I would\nconquer a place for myself, if it were only for the satisfaction of\nknowing that I was really a man. Here cushions are sewed under your\narms, a hundred invisible threads bind you to a life of idleness and\nvanity, everybody is ready to carry you on his hands, the road is\nsmoothed for you, every stone carefully moved out of your path, and you\nwill probably go to your grave without having ever harbored one earnest\nthought, without having done one manly deed.”\n\nRalph stood transfixed, gazing at her with open mouth; he felt a kind of\nstupid fright, as if some one had suddenly seized him by the shoulders\nand shaken him violently. He tried vainly to remove his eyes from\nBertha. She held him as by a powerful spell. He saw that her face was\nlighted with an altogether new beauty; he noticed the deep glow upon her\ncheek, the brilliancy of her eye, the slight quiver of her lip. But he\nsaw all this as one sees things in a half-trance, without attempting to\naccount for them; the door between his soul and his senses was closed.\n\n“I know that I have been bold in speaking to you in this way,” she said\nat last, seating herself in a chair at the window. “But it was yourself\nwho asked me. And I have felt all the time that I should have to tell\nyou this before we parted.”\n\n“And,” answered he, making a strong effort to appear calm, “if I follow\nyour advice, will you allow me to see you once more before you go?”\n\n“I shall remain here another week, and shall, during that time, always\nbe ready to receive you.”\n\n“Thank you. Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye.”\n\nRalph carefully avoided all the fashionable thoroughfares; he felt\ndegraded before himself, and he had an idea that every man could read\nhis humiliation in his countenance. Now he walked on quickly, striking\nthe sidewalk with his heels; now, again, he fell into an uneasy,\nreckless saunter, according as the changing moods inspired defiance\nof his sentence, or a qualified surrender. And, as he walked on, the\nbitterness grew within him, and he pitilessly reviled himself for having\nallowed himself to be made a fool of by “that little country goose,”\n when he was well aware that there were hundreds of women of the best\nfamilies of the land who would feel honored at receiving his attentions.\nBut this sort of reasoning he knew to be both weak and contemptible, and\nhis better self soon rose in loud rebellion.\n\n“After all,” he muttered, “in the main thing she was right. I am a\nmiserable good-for-nothing, a hot-house plant, a poor stick, and if I\nwere a woman myself, I don’t think I should waste my affections on a man\nof that calibre.”\n\nThen he unconsciously fell to analyzing Bertha’s character, wondering\nvaguely that a person who moved so timidly in social life, appearing\nso diffident, from an ever-present fear of blundering against the\nestablished forms of etiquette, could judge so quickly, and with such a\nmerciless certainty, whenever a moral question, a question of right\nand wrong, was at issue. And, pursuing the same train of thought, he\ncontrasted her with himself, who moved in the highest spheres of society\nas in his native element, heedless of moral scruples, and conscious of\nno loftier motive for his actions than the immediate pleasure of the\nmoment.\n\nAs Ralph turned the corner of a street, he heard himself hailed from the\nother sidewalk by a chorus of merry voices.\n\n“Ah, my dear Baroness,” cried a young man, springing across the street\nand grasping Ralph’s hand (all his student friends called him the\nBaroness), “in the name of this illustrious company, allow me to salute\nyou. But why the deuce--what is the matter with you? If you have the\nKatzenjammer, [7] soda-water is the thing. Come along,--it’s my treat!”\n\nThe students instantly thronged around Ralph, who stood distractedly\nswinging his cane and smiling idiotically.\n\n“I am not quite well,” said he; “leave me alone.”\n\n“No, to be sure, you don’t look well,” cried a jolly youth, against\nwhom Bertha had frequently warned him; “but a glass of sherry will soon\nrestore you. It would be highly immoral to leave you in this condition\nwithout taking care of you.”\n\nRalph again vainly tried to remonstrate; but the end was, that he\nreluctantly followed.\n\nHe had always been a conspicuous figure in the student world; but that\nnight he astonished his friends by his eloquence, his reckless humor,\nand his capacity for drinking. He made a speech for “Woman,” which\nbristled with wit, cynicism, and sarcastic epigrams. One young man,\nnamed Vinter, who was engaged, undertook to protest against his sweeping\ncondemnation, and declared that Ralph, who was a Universal favorite\namong the ladies, ought to be the last to revile them.\n\n“If,” he went on, “the Baroness should propose to six well-known\nladies here in this city whom I could mention, I would wager six\nJohannisbergers, and an equal amount of champagne, that every one of\nthem would accept him.”\n\nThe others loudly applauded this proposal, and Ralph accepted the wager.\nThe letters were written on the spot, and immediately dispatched. Toward\nmorning, the merry carousal broke up, and Ralph was conducted in triumph\nto his home.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nTwo days later, Ralph again knocked on Bertha’s door. He looked paler\nthan usual, almost haggard; his immaculate linen was a little crumpled,\nand he carried no cane; his lips were tightly compressed, and his face\nwore an air of desperate resolution.\n\n“It is done,” he said, as he seated himself opposite her. “I am going.”\n\n“Going!” cried she, startled at his unusual appearance. “How, where?”\n\n“To America. I sail to-night. I have followed your advice, you see. I\nhave cut off the last bridge behind me.”\n\n“But, Ralph,” she exclaimed, in a voice of alarm. “Something dreadful\nmust have happened. Tell me quick; I must know it.”\n\n“No; nothing dreadful,” muttered he, smiling bitterly. “I have made\na little scandal, that is all. My father told me to-day to go to the\ndevil, if I chose, and my mother gave me five hundred dollars to help me\nalong on the way. If you wish to know, here is the explanation.”\n\nAnd he pulled from his pocket six perfumed and carefully folded notes,\nand threw them into her lap.\n\n“Do you wish me to read them?” she asked, with growing surprise.\n\n“Certainly. Why not?”\n\nShe hastily opened one note after the other, and read.\n\n“But, Ralph,” she cried, springing up from her seat, while her eyes\nflamed with indignation, “what does this mean? What have you done?”\n\n“I didn’t think it needed any explanation,” replied he, with feigned\nindifference. “I proposed to them all, and, you see, they all accepted\nme. I received all these letters to-day. I only wished to know whether\nthe whole world regarded me as such a worthless scamp as you told me I\nwas.”\n\nShe did not answer, but sat mutely staring at him, fiercely crumpling a\nrose-colored note in her hand. He began to feel uncomfortable under her\ngaze, and threw himself about uneasily in his chair.\n\n“Well,” said he, at length, rising, “I suppose there is nothing more.\nGood-bye.”\n\n“One moment, Mr. Grim,” demanded she, sternly. “Since I have already\nsaid so much, and you have obligingly revealed to me a new side of your\ncharacter, I claim the right to correct the opinion I expressed of you\nat our last meeting.”\n\n“I am all attention.”\n\n“I did think, Mr. Grim,” began she, breathing hard, and steadying\nherself against the table at which she stood, “that you were a very\nselfish man--an embodiment of selfishness, absolute and supreme, but I\ndid not believe that you were wicked.”\n\n“And what convinced you that I was selfish, if I may ask?”\n\n“What convinced me?” repeated she, in a tone of inexpressible contempt.\n“When did you ever act from any generous regard for others? What good\ndid you ever do to anybody?”\n\n“You might ask, with equal justice, what good I ever did to myself.”\n\n“In a certain sense, yes; because to gratify a mere momentary wish is\nhardly doing one’s self good.”\n\n“Then I have, at all events, followed the Biblical precept, and treated\nmy neighbor very much as I treat myself.”\n\n“I did think,” continued Bertha, without heeding the remark, “that you\nwere at bottom kind-hearted, but too hopelessly well-bred ever to commit\nan act of any decided complexion, either good or bad. Now I see that\nI have misjudged you, and that you are capable of outraging the most\nsacred feelings of a woman’s heart in mere wantonness, or for the sake\nof satisfying a base curiosity, which never could have entered the mind\nof an upright and generous man.”\n\nThe hard, benumbed look in Ralph’s face thawed in the warmth of her\npresence, and her words, though stern, touched a secret spring in his\nheart. He made two or three vain attempts to speak, then suddenly broke\ndown, and cried:\n\n“Bertha, Bertha, even if you scorn me, have patience with me, and\nlisten.”\n\nAnd he told her, in rapid, broken sentences, how his love for her had\ngrown from day to day, until he could no longer master it; and how, in\nan unguarded moment, when his pride rose in fierce conflict against\nhis love, he had done this reckless deed of which he was now heartily\nashamed. The fervor of his words touched her, for she felt that they\nwere sincere. Large mute tears trembled in her eyelashes as she sat\ngazing tenderly at him, and in the depth of her soul the wish awoke that\nshe might have been able to return this great and strong love of his;\nfor she felt that in this love lay the germ of a new, of a stronger and\nbetter man. She noticed, with a half-regretful pleasure, his handsome\nfigure, his delicately shaped hands, and the noble cast of his features;\nan overwhelming pity for him rose within her, and she began to reproach\nherself for having spoken so harshly, and, as she now thought, so\nunjustly. Perhaps he read in her eyes the unspoken wish. He seized her\nhand, and his words fell with a warm and alluring cadence upon her ear.\n\n“I shall not see you for a long time to come, Bertha,” said he, “but if,\nat the end of five or six years your hand is still free, and I\nreturn another man--a man to whom you could safely intrust your\nhappiness--would you then listen to what I may have to say to you? For I\npromise, by all that we both hold sacred--”\n\n“No, no,” interrupted she, hastily. “Promise nothing. It would be unjust\nto--yourself, and perhaps also to me; for a sacred promise is a terrible\nthing, Ralph. Let us both remain free; and, if you return and still love\nme, then come, and I shall receive you and listen to you. And even if\nyou have outgrown your love, which is, indeed, more probable, come still\nto visit me wherever I may be, and we shall meet as friends and rejoice\nin the meeting.”\n\n“You know best,” he murmured. “Let it be as you have said.”\n\nHe arose, took her face between his hands, gazed long and tenderly into\nher eyes, pressed a kiss upon her forehead, and hastened away.\n\nThat night Ralph boarded the steamer for Hull, and three weeks later\nlanded in New York.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe first three months of Ralph’s sojourn in America were spent in vain\nattempts to obtain a situation. Day after day he walked down Broadway,\ncalling at various places of business and night after night he returned\nto his cheerless room with a faint heart and declining spirits. It was,\nafter all, a more serious thing than he had imagined, to cut the cable\nwhich binds one to the land of one’s birth. There a hundred subtile\ninfluences, the existence of which no one suspects until the moment they\nare withdrawn, unite to keep one in the straight path of rectitude, or\nat least of external respectability; and Ralph’s life had been all in\nsociety; the opinion of his fellow-men had been the one force to which\nhe implicitly deferred, and the conscience by which he had been wont\nto test his actions had been nothing but the aggregate judgment of his\nfriends. To such a man the isolation and the utter irresponsibility of a\nlife among strangers was tenfold more dangerous; and Ralph found, to his\nhorror, that his character contained innumerable latent possibilities\nwhich the easygoing life in his home probably never would have revealed\nto him. It often cut him to the quick, when, on entering an office in\nhis daily search for employment, he was met by hostile or suspicious\nglances, or when, as it occasionally happened, the door was slammed in\nhis face, as if he were a vagabond or an impostor. Then the wolf was\noften roused within him, and he felt a momentary wild desire to become\nwhat the people here evidently believed him to be. Many a night he\nsauntered irresolutely about the gambling places in obscure streets,\nand the glare of light, the rude shouts and clamors in the same moment\nrepelled and attracted him. If he went to the devil, who would care? His\nfather had himself pointed out the way to him; and nobody could blame\nhim if he followed the advice. But then again a memory emerged from that\nchamber of his soul which still he held sacred; and Bertha’s deep-blue\neyes gazed upon him with their earnest look of tender warning and\nregret.\n\nWhen the summer was half gone, Ralph had gained many a hard victory over\nhimself, and learned many a useful lesson; and at length he swallowed\nhis pride, divested himself of his fine clothes, and accepted a\nposition as assistant gardener at a villa on the Hudson. And as he stood\nperspiring with a spade in his hand, and a cheap broad-brimmed straw hat\non his head, he often took a grim pleasure in picturing to himself\nhow his aristocratic friends at home would receive him, if he should\nintroduce himself to them in this new costume.\n\n“After all, it was only my position they cared for,” he reflected,\nbitterly; “without my father’s name what would I be to them?”\n\nThen, again, there was a certain satisfaction in knowing that, for\nhis present situation, humble as it was, he was indebted to nobody but\nhimself; and the thought that Bertha’s eyes, if they could have seen him\nnow would have dwelt upon him with pleasure and approbation, went far to\nconsole him for his aching back, his sunburned face, and his swollen and\nblistered hands.\n\nOne day, as Ralph was raking the gravel-walks in the garden, his\nemployer’s daughter, a young lady of seventeen, came out and spoke to\nhim. His culture and refinement of manner struck her with wonder, and\nshe asked him to tell her his history; but then he suddenly grew very\ngrave, and she forbore pressing him. From that time she attached a kind\nof romantic interest to him, and finally induced her father to obtain\nhim a situation that would be more to his taste. And, before winter\ncame, Ralph saw the dawn of a new future glimmering before him. He had\nwrestled bravely with fate, and had once more gained a victory. He began\nthe career in which success and distinction awaited him, as proof-reader\non a newspaper in the city. He had fortunately been familiar with the\nEnglish language before he left home, and by the strength of his will he\nconquered all difficulties. At the end of two years he became attached\nto the editorial staff; new ambitious hopes, hitherto foreign to his\nmind, awoke within him; and with joyous tumult of heart he saw life\nopening its wide vistas before him, and he labored on manfully to repair\nthe losses of the past, and to prepare himself for greater usefulness in\ntimes to come. He felt in himself a stronger and fuller manhood, as if\nthe great arteries of the vast universal world-life pulsed in his own\nbeing. The drowsy, indolent existence at home appeared like a dull\nremote dream from which he had awaked, and he blessed the destiny which,\nby its very sternness, had mercifully saved him; he blessed her, too,\nwho, from the very want of love for him, had, perhaps, made him worthier\nof love.\n\nThe years flew rapidly. Society had flung its doors open to him, and\nwhat was more, he had found some warm friends, in whose houses he\ncould come and go at pleasure. He enjoyed keenly the privilege of daily\nassociation with high-minded and refined women; their eager activity\nof intellect stimulated him, their exquisite ethereal grace and their\ndelicately chiseled beauty satisfied his aesthetic cravings, and the\nresponsive vivacity of their nature prepared him ever new surprises.\nHe felt a strange fascination in the presence of these women, and the\nconviction grew upon him that their type of womanhood was superior to\nany he had hitherto known. And by way of refuting his own argument, he\nwould draw from his pocket-book the photograph of Bertha, which had\na secret compartment there all to itself, and, gazing tenderly at it,\nwould eagerly defend her against the disparaging reflections which the\ninvoluntary comparison had provoked. And still, how could he help seeing\nthat her features, though well molded, lacked animation; that her eye,\nwith its deep, trustful glance, was not brilliant, and that the calm\nearnestness of her face, when compared with the bright, intellectual\nbeauty of his present friends, appeared pale and simple, like a violet\nin a bouquet of vividly colored roses? It gave him a quick pang, when,\nat times, he was forced to admit this; nevertheless, it was the truth.\n\nAfter six years of residence in America, Ralph had gained a very high\nreputation as a journalist of rare culture and ability, and, in 1867\nhe was sent to the World’s Exhibition in Paris, as correspondent of the\npaper on which he had during all these years been employed. What wonder,\nthen, that he started for Europe a few weeks before his presence was\nneeded in the imperial city, and that he steered his course directly\ntoward the fjord valley where Bertha had her home? It was she who had\nbidden him Godspeed when he fled from the land of his birth, and she,\ntoo, should receive his first greeting on his return.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe sun had fortified itself behind a citadel of flaming clouds, and the\nupper forest region shone with a strange ethereal glow, while the\nlower plains were wrapped in shadow; but the shadow itself had a\nstrong suffusion of color. The mountain peaks rose cold and blue in the\ndistance.\n\nRalph, having inquired his way of the boatman who had landed him at the\npier, walked rapidly along the beach, with a small valise in his hand,\nand a light summer overcoat flung over his shoulder. Many half-thoughts\ngrazed his mind, and ere the first had taken shape, the second, and the\nthird came and chased it away. And still they all in some fashion had\nreference to Bertha; for in a misty, abstract way, she filled his whole\nmind; but for some indefinable reason, he was afraid to give free rein\nto the sentiment which lurked in the remoter corners of his soul.\n\nOnward he hastened, while his heart throbbed with the quickening tempo\nof mingled expectation and fear. Now and then one of those chill gusts\nof air which seem to be careering about aimlessly in the atmosphere\nduring early summer, would strike into his face, and recall him to a\nkeener self-consciousness.\n\nRalph concluded, from his increasing agitation, that he must be very\nnear Bertha’s home. He stopped and looked around him. He saw a large\nmaple at the roadside, some thirty steps from where he was standing,\nand the girl who was sitting under it, resting her head in her hand and\ngazing out over the sea, he recognized in an instant to be Bertha. He\nsprang up on the road, not crossing, however, her line of vision, and\napproached her noiselessly from behind.\n\n“Bertha,” he whispered.\n\nShe gave a little joyous cry, sprang up, and made a gesture as if\nto throw herself in his arms; then suddenly checked herself, blushed\ncrimson, and moved a step backward.\n\n“You came so suddenly,” she murmured.\n\n“But, Bertha,” cried he (and the full bass of his voice rang through her\nvery soul), “have I gone into exile and waited these many years for so\ncold a welcome?”\n\n“You have changed so much, Ralph,” she answered, with that old grave\nsmile which he knew so well, and stretched out both her hands toward\nhim. “And I have thought of you so much since you went away, and blamed\nmyself because I had judged you so harshly, and wondered that you could\nlisten to me so patiently, and never bear me any malice for what I\nsaid.”\n\n“If you had said a word less,” declared Ralph, seating himself at\nher side on the greensward, “or if you had varnished it over with\npoliteness, then you would probably have failed to produce any effect\nand I should not have been burdened with that heavy debt of gratitude\nwhich I now owe you. I was a pretty thick-skinned animal in those days,\nBertha. You said the right word at the right moment; you gave me a hold\nand a good piece of advice, which my own ingenuity would never have\nsuggested to me. I will not thank you, because, in so grave a case as\nthis, spoken thanks sound like a mere mockery. Whatever I am, Bertha,\nand whatever I may hope to be, I owe it all to that hour.”\n\nShe listened with rapture to the manly assurance of his voice; her eyes\ndwelt with unspeakable joy upon his strong, bronzed features, his full\nthick blonde beard, and the vigorous proportions of his frame. Many and\nmany a time during his absence had she wondered how he would look if\nhe ever came back, and with that minute conscientiousness which, as it\nwere, pervaded her whole character, she had held herself responsible\nbefore God for his fate, prayed for him, and trembled lest evil powers\nshould gain the ascendency over his soul.\n\nOn their way to the house they talked together of many things, but in\na guarded, cautious fashion, and without the cheerful abandonment of\nformer years. They both, as it were, groped their way carefully in each\nother’s minds, and each vaguely felt that there was something in the\nother’s thought which it was not well to touch unbidden. Bertha saw\nthat all her fears for him had been groundless, and his very appearance\nlifted the whole weight of responsibility from her breast; and still,\ndid she rejoice at her deliverance from her burden? Ah, no, in this\nmoment she knew that that which she had foolishly cherished as the best\nand noblest part of herself, had been but a selfish need of her own\nheart. She feared that she had only taken that interest in him which one\nfeels in a thing of one’s own making; and now, when she saw that he had\nrisen quite above her; that he was free and strong, and could have no\nmore need of her, she had, instead of generous pleasure at his success,\nbut a painful sense of emptiness, as if something very dear had been\ntaken from her.\n\nRalph, too, was loath to analyze the impression his old love made upon\nhim. His feelings were of so complex a nature, he was anxious to keep\nhis more magnanimous impulses active, and he strove hard to convince\nhimself that she was still the same to him as she had been before they\nhad ever parted. But, alas! though the heart be warm and generous, the\neye is a merciless critic. And the man who had moved on the wide arena\nof the world, whose mind had housed the large thoughts of this century,\nand expanded with its invigorating breath,--was he to blame because he\nhad unconsciously outgrown his old provincial self, and could no more\njudge by its standards?\n\nBertha’s father was a peasant, but he had, by his lumber trade, acquired\nwhat in Norway was called a very handsome fortune. He received his guest\nwith dignified reserve, and Ralph thought he detected in his eyes a\nlurking look of distrust. “I know your errand,” that look seemed to say,\n“but you had better give it up at once. It will be of no use for you to\ntry.”\n\nAnd after supper, as Ralph and Bertha sat talking confidingly with each\nother at the window, he sent his daughter a quick, sharp glance, and\nthen, without ceremony, commanded her to go to bed. Ralph’s heart gave\na great thump within him; not because he feared the old man, but because\nhis words, as well as his glances, revealed to him the sad history of\nthese long, patient years. He doubted no longer that the love which he\nhad once so ardently desired was his at last; and he made a silent vow\nthat, come what might, he would remain faithful.\n\nAs he came down to breakfast the next morning, he found Bertha sitting\nat the window, engaged in hemming what appeared to be a rough kitchen\ntowel. She bent eagerly over her work, and only a vivid flush upon her\ncheek told him that she had noticed his coming. He took a chair, seated\nhimself opposite her, and bade her “good-morning.” She raised her head,\nand showed him a sweet, troubled countenance, which the early sunlight\nillumined with a high spiritual beauty. It reminded him forcibly of\nthose pale, sweet-faced saints of Fra Angelico, with whom the frail\nflesh seems ever on the point of yielding to the ardent aspirations of\nthe spirit. And still, even in this moment he could not prevent his eyes\nfrom observing that one side of her forefinger was rough from sewing,\nand that the whiteness of her arm, which the loose sleeves displayed,\ncontrasted strongly with the browned and sun-burned complexion of her\nhands.\n\nAfter breakfast they again walked together on the beach, and Ralph,\nhaving once formed his resolution, now talked freely of the New\nWorld--of his sphere of activity there; of his friends and of his plans\nfor the future; and she listened to him with a mild, perplexed look in\nher eyes, as if trying vainly to follow the flight of his thoughts. And\nhe wondered, with secret dismay, whether she was still the same strong,\nbrave-hearted girl whom he had once accounted almost bold; whether the\nlife in this narrow valley, amid a hundred petty and depressing cares,\nhad not cramped her spiritual growth, and narrowed the sphere of her\nthought. Or was she still the same, and was it only he who had changed?\nAt last he gave utterance to his wonder, and she answered him in those\ngrave, earnest tones which seemed in themselves to be half a refutation\nof his doubts.\n\n“It was easy for me to give you daring advice, then, Ralph,” she said.\n“Like most school-girls, I thought that life was a great and glorious\nthing, and that happiness was a fruit which hung within reach of every\nhand. Now I have lived for six years trying single-handed to relieve the\nwant and suffering of the needy people with whom I come in contact,\nand their squalor and wretchedness have sickened me, and, what is still\nworse, I feel that all I can do is as a drop in the ocean, and after\nall, amounts to nothing. I know I am no longer the same reckless girl,\nwho, with the very best intention, sent you wandering through the wide\nworld; and I thank God that it proved to be for your good, although the\nwhole now appears quite incredible to me. My thoughts have moved so long\nwithin the narrow circle of these mountains that they have lost their\nyouthful elasticity, and can no more rise above them.”\n\nRalph detected, in the midst of her despondency, a spark of her former\nfire, and grew eloquent in his endeavors to persuade her that she was\nunjust to herself, and that there was but a wider sphere of life needed\nto develop all the latent powers of her rich nature.\n\nAt the dinner-table, her father again sat eyeing his guest with that\nsame cold look of distrust and suspicion. And when the meal was at\nan end, he rose abruptly and called his daughter into another room.\nPresently Ralph heard his angry voice resounding through the house,\ninterrupted now and then by a woman’s sobs, and a subdued, passionate\npleading. When Bertha again entered the room, her eyes were very\nred, and he saw that she had been weeping. She threw a shawl over her\nshoulders, beckoned to him with her hand, and he arose and followed her.\nShe led the way silently until they reached a thick copse of birch and\nalder near the strand. She dropped down upon a bench between two trees,\nand he took his seat at her side.\n\n“Ralph,” began she, with a visible effort, “I hardly know what to say to\nyou; but there is something which I must tell you--my father wishes you\nto leave us at once.”\n\n“And YOU, Bertha?”\n\n“Well--yes--I wish it too.”\n\nShe saw the painful shock which her words gave him, and she strove hard\nto speak. Her lips trembled, her eyes became suffused with tears, which\ngrew and grew, but never fell; she could not utter a word.\n\n“Well, Bertha,” answered he, with a little quiver in his voice, “if you,\ntoo, wish me to go, I shall not tarry. Good-bye.”\n\nHe rose quickly, and, with averted face, held out his hand to her; but\nas she made no motion to grasp the hand, he began distractedly to button\nhis coat, and moved slowly away.\n\n“Ralph.”\n\nHe turned sharply, and, before he knew it, she lay sobbing upon his\nbreast.\n\n“Ralph,” she murmured, while the tears almost choked her words, “I could\nnot have you leave me thus. It is hard enough--it is hard enough--”\n\n“What is hard, beloved?”\n\nShe raised her head abruptly, and turned upon him a gaze full of hope\nand doubt, and sweet perplexity.\n\n“Ah, no, you do not love me,” she whispered, sadly.\n\n“Why should I come to seek you, after these many years, dearest, if I\ndid not wish to make you my wife before God and men? Why should I--”\n\n“Ah, yes, I know,” she interrupted him with a fresh fit of weeping, “you\nare too good and honest to wish to throw me away, now when you have seen\nhow my soul has hungered for the sight of you these many years, how even\nnow I cling to you with a despairing clutch. But you cannot disguise\nyourself, Ralph, and I saw from the first moment that you loved me no\nmore.”\n\n“Do not be such an unreasonable child,” he remonstrated, feebly. “I do\nnot love you with the wild, irrational passion of former years; but I\nhave the tenderest regard for you, and my heart warms at the sight of\nyour sweet face, and I shall do all in my power to make you as happy as\nany man can make you who--”\n\n“Who does not love me,” she finished.\n\nA sudden shudder seemed to shake her whole frame, and she drew herself\nmore tightly up to him.\n\n“Ah, no,” she continued, after a while, sinking back upon her seat.\n“It is a hopeless thing to compel a reluctant heart. I will accept no\nsacrifice from you. You owe me nothing, for you have acted toward me\nhonestly and uprightly, and I shall be a stronger, or--at least--a\nbetter woman for what you gave me--and--for what you could not give me,\neven though you would.”\n\n“But, Bertha,” exclaimed he, looking mournfully at her, “it is not true\nwhen you say that I owe you nothing. Six years ago, when first I wooed\nyou, you could not return my love, and you sent me out into the world,\nand even refused to accept any pledge or promise for the future.”\n\n“And you returned,” she responded, “a man, such as my hope had pictured\nyou; but, while I had almost been standing still, you had outgrown me,\nand outgrown your old self, and, with your old self, outgrown its love\nfor me, for your love was not of your new self, but of the old. Alas! it\nis a sad tale, but it is true.”\n\nShe spoke gravely now, and with a steadier voice, but her eyes hung upon\nhis face with an eager look of expectation, as if yearning to detect\nthere some gleam of hope, some contradiction of the dismal truth. He\nread that look aright, and it pierced him like a sharp sword. He made a\nbrave effort to respond to its appeal, but his features seemed hard as\nstone, and he could only cry out against his destiny, and bewail his\nmisfortune and hers.\n\nToward evening, Ralph was sitting in an open boat, listening to the\nmeasured oar-strokes of the boatmen who were rowing him out to the\nnearest stopping-place of the steamer. The mountains lifted their great\nplacid heads up among the sun-bathed clouds, and the fjord opened its\ncool depths as if to make room for their vast reflections. Ralph felt as\nif he were floating in the midst of the blue infinite space, and, with\nthe strength which this feeling inspired, he tried to face boldly the\nthought from which he had but a moment ago shrunk as from something\nhopelessly sad and perplexing.\n\nAnd in that hour he looked fearlessly into the gulf which separates the\nNew World from the Old. He had hoped to bridge it; but, alas! it cannot\nbe bridged.\n\n\n\n\nA SCIENTIFIC VAGABOND.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nTHE steamer which as far back as 1860 passed every week on its northward\nway up along the coast of Norway, was of a very sociable turn of mind.\nIt ran with much shrieking and needless bluster in and out the calm,\nwinding fjords, paid unceremonious little visits in every out-of-the-way\nnook and bay, dropped now and then a black heap of coal into the\nshining water, and sent thick volleys of smoke and shrill little echoes\ncareering aimlessly among the mountains. It seemed, on the whole, from\nan aesthetic point of view, an objectionable phenomenon--a blot upon the\nperfect summer day. By the inhabitants, however, of these remote regions\n(with the exception of a few obstinate individuals, who had at first\nlooked upon it as the sure herald of dooms-day, and still were vaguely\nwondering what the world was coming to,) it was regarded in a very\ndifferent light. This choleric little monster was to them a friendly\nand welcome visitor, which established their connection with the outside\nworld, and gave them a proud consciousness of living in the very heart\nof civilization. Therefore, on steamboat days they flocked en masse\ndown on the piers, and, with an ever-fresh sense of novelty, greeted the\napproaching boat with lively cheers, with firing of muskets and waving\nof handkerchiefs. The men of condition, as the judge, the sheriff, and\nthe parson, whose dignity forbade them to receive the steamer in person,\ncontented themselves with watching it through an opera-glass from their\nbalconies; and if a high official was known to be on board, they perhaps\ndisplayed the national banner from their flag-poles, as a delicate\ncompliment to their superior.\n\nBut the Rev. Mr. Oddson, the parson of whom I have to speak, had this\nday yielded to the gentle urgings of his daughters (as, indeed, he\nalways did), and had with them boarded the steamer to receive his\nnephew, Arnfinn Vording, who was returning from the university for\nhis summer vacation. And now they had him between them in their pretty\nwhite-painted parsonage boat, with the blue line along the gunwale,\nbeleaguering him with eager questions about friends and relatives in\nthe capital, chums, university sports, and a medley of other things\ninteresting to young ladies who have a collegian for a cousin. His uncle\nwas charitable enough to check his own curiosity about the nephew’s\nprogress in the arts and sciences, and the result of his recent\nexaminations, till he should have become fairly settled under his roof;\nand Arnfinn, who, in spite of his natural brightness and ready humor,\nwas anything but a “dig,” was grateful for the respite.\n\nThe parsonage lay snugly nestled at the end of the bay, shining\ncontentedly through the green foliage from a multitude of small\nsun-smitten windows. Its pinkish whitewash, which was peeling off from\nlong exposure to the weather, was in cheerful contrast to the broad\nblack surface of the roof, with its glazed tiles, and the starlings’\nnests under the chimney-tops. The thick-leaved maples and walnut-trees\nwhich grew in random clusters about the walls seemed loftily conscious\nof standing there for purposes of protection; for, wherever their\nlong-fingered branches happened to graze the roof, it was always with a\ntouch, light, graceful, and airily caressing. The irregularly paved yard\nwas inclosed on two sides by the main building, and on the third by\na species of log cabin, which, in Norway, is called a brew-house; but\ntoward the west the view was but slightly obscured by an elevated\npigeon cot and a clump of birches, through whose sparse leaves the\nfjord beneath sent its rapid jets and gleams of light, and its strange\nsuggestions of distance, peace and unaccountable gladness.\n\nArnfinn Vording’s career had presented that subtle combination of farce\nand tragedy which most human lives are apt to be; and if the tragic\nelement had during his early years been preponderating, he was hardly\nhimself aware of it; for he had been too young at the death of his\nparents to feel that keenness of grief which the same privation would\nhave given him at a later period of his life. It might have been\nhumiliating to confess it, but it was nevertheless true that the terror\nhe had once sustained on being pursued by a furious bull was much more\nvivid in his memory than the vague wonder and depression which had\nfilled his mind at seeing his mother so suddenly stricken with age, as\nshe lay motionless in her white robes in the front parlor. Since then\nhis uncle, who was his guardian and nearest relative, had taken him into\nhis family, had instructed him with his own daughters, and finally sent\nhim to the University, leaving the little fortune which he had\ninherited to accumulate for future use. Arnfinn had a painfully distinct\nrecollection of his early hardships in trying to acquire that soft\npronunciation of the r which is peculiar to the western fjord districts\nof Norway, and which he admired so much in his cousins; for the\nmerry-eyed Inga, who was less scrupulous by a good deal than her older\nsister, Augusta, had from the beginning persisted in interpreting their\nrelation of cousinship as an unbounded privilege on her part to ridicule\nhim for his personal peculiarities, and especially for his harsh r and\nhis broad eastern accent. Her ridicule was always very good-natured, to\nbe sure, but therefore no less annoying.\n\nBut--such is the perverseness of human nature--in spite of a series\nof apparent rebuffs, interrupted now and then by fits of violent\nattachment, Arnfinn had early selected this dimpled and yellow-haired\nyoung girl, with her piquant little nose, for his favorite cousin.\nIt was the prospect of seeing her which, above all else, had lent,\nin anticipation, an altogether new radiance to the day when he should\npresent himself in his home with the long-tasseled student cap on\nhis head, the unnecessary “pinchers” on his nose, and with the other\ntraditional paraphernalia of the Norwegian student. That great day had\nnow come; Arnfinn sat at Inga’s side playing with her white fingers,\nwhich lay resting on his knee, and covering the depth of his feeling\nwith harmless banter about her “amusingly unclassical little nose.”\n He had once detected her, when a child, standing before a mirror, and\npinching this unhappy feature in the middle, in the hope of making\nit “like Augusta’s;” and since then he had no longer felt so utterly\ndefenseless whenever his own foibles were attacked.\n\n“But what of your friend, Arnfinn?” exclaimed Inga, as she ran up the\nstairs of the pier. “He of whom you have written so much. I have been\nbusy all the morning making the blue guest-chamber ready for him.”\n\n“Please, cousin,” answered the student, in a tone of mock entreaty,\n“only an hour’s respite! If we are to talk about Strand we must make a\nday of it, you know. And just now it seems so grand to be at home, and\nwith you, that I would rather not admit even so genial a subject as\nStrand to share my selfish happiness.”\n\n“Ah, yes, you are right. Happiness is too often selfish. But tell me\nonly why he didn’t come and I’ll release you.”\n\n“He IS coming.”\n\n“Ah! And when?”\n\n“That I don’t know. He preferred to take the journey on foot, and he\nmay be here at almost any time. But, as I have told you, he is very\nuncertain. If he should happen to make the acquaintance of some\ninteresting snipe, or crane, or plover, he may prefer its company to\nours, and then there is no counting on him any longer. He may be as\nlikely to turn up at the North Pole as at the Gran Parsonage.”\n\n“How very singular. You don’t know how curious I am to see him.”\n\nAnd Inga walked on in silence under the sunny birches which grew along\nthe road, trying vainly to picture to herself this strange phenomenon of\na man.\n\n“I brought his book,” remarked Arnfinn, making a gigantic effort to be\ngenerous, for he felt dim stirrings of jealousy within him. “If you care\nto read it, I think it will explain him to you better than anything I\ncould say.”\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Oddsons were certainly a happy family though not by any means a\nharmonious one. The excellent pastor, who was himself neutrally good,\northodox, and kind-hearted, had often, in the privacy of his own\nthought, wondered what hidden ancestral influences there might have\nbeen at work in giving a man so peaceable and inoffensive as himself two\ndaughters of such strongly defined individuality. There was Augusta, the\nelder, who was what Arnfinn called “indiscriminately reformatory,” and\nhad a universal desire to improve everything, from the Government down\nto agricultural implements and preserve jars. As long as she was content\nto expend the surplus energy, which seemed to accumulate within her\nthrough the long eventless winters, upon the Zulu Mission, and other\nlegitimate objects, the pastor thought it all harmless enough; although,\nto be sure, her enthusiasm for those naked and howling savages did at\ntimes strike him as being somewhat extravagant. But when occasionally,\nin her own innocent way, she put both his patience and his orthodoxy to\nthe test by her exceedingly puzzling questions, then he could not, in\nthe depth of his heart, restrain the wish that she might have been more\nlike other young girls, and less ardently solicitous about the fate of\nher kind. Affectionate and indulgent, however, as the pastor was,\nhe would often, in the next moment, do penance for his unregenerate\nthought, and thank God for having made her so fair to behold, so pure,\nand so noble-hearted.\n\nToward Arnfinn, Augusta had, although of his own age, early assumed a\nkind of elder-sisterly relation; she had been his comforter during all\nthe trials of his boyhood; had yielded him her sympathy with that eager\nimpulse which lay so deep in her nature, and had felt forlorn when life\nhad called him away to where her words of comfort could not reach him.\nBut when once she had hinted this to her father, he had pedantically\nconvinced her that her feeling was unchristian, and Inga had playfully\nremarked that the hope that some one might soon find the open Polar Sea\nwould go far toward consoling her for her loss; for Augusta had glorious\nvisions at that time of the open Polar Sea. Now, the Polar Sea, and\nmany other things, far nearer and dearer, had been forced into uneasy\nforgetfulness; and Arnfinn was once more with her, no longer a child,\nand no longer appealing to her for aid and sympathy; man enough,\napparently, to have outgrown his boyish needs and still boy enough to be\nashamed of having ever had them.\n\nIt was the third Sunday after Arnfinn’s return. He and Augusta were\nclimbing the hillside to the “Giant’s Hood,” from whence they had a wide\nview of the fjord, and could see the sun trailing its long bridge of\nflame upon the water. It was Inga’s week in the kitchen, therefore her\nsister was Arnfinn’s companion. As they reached the crest of the “Hood,”\n Augusta seated herself on a flat bowlder, and the young student flung\nhimself on a patch of greensward at her feet. The intense light of the\nlate sun fell upon the girl’s unconscious face, and Arnfinn lay, gazing\nup into it, and wondering at its rare beauty; but he saw only the clean\ncut of its features and the purity of its form, being too shallow to\nrecognize the strong and heroic soul which had struggled so long\nfor utterance in the life of which he had been a blind and unmindful\nwitness.\n\n“Gracious, how beautiful you are, cousin!” he broke forth, heedlessly,\nstriking his leg with his slender cane; “pity you were not born a queen;\nyou would be equal to almost anything, even if it were to discover the\nPolar Sea.”\n\n“I thought you were looking at the sun, Arnfinn,” answered she, smiling\nreluctantly.\n\n“And so I am, cousin,” laughed he, with an other-emphatic slap of his\nboot.\n\n“That compliment is rather stale.”\n\n“But the opportunity was too tempting.”\n\n“Never mind, I will excuse you from further efforts. Turn around and\nnotice that wonderful purple halo which is hovering over the forests\nbelow. Isn’t it glorious?”\n\n“No, don’t let us be solemn, pray. The sun I have seen a thousand\ntimes before, but you I have seen very seldom of late. Somehow, since\nI returned this time, you seem to keep me at a distance. You no longer\nconfide to me your great plans for the abolishment of war, and the\nimprovement of mankind generally. Why don’t you tell me whether you\nhave as yet succeeded in convincing the peasants that cleanliness is\na cardinal virtue, that hawthorn hedges are more picturesque than rail\nfences, and that salt meat is a very indigestible article?”\n\n“You know the fate of my reforms, from long experience,” she answered,\nwith the same sad, sweet smile. “I am afraid there must be some thing\nradically wrong about my methods; and, moreover, I know that your\naspirations and mine are no longer the same, if they ever have been, and\nI am not ungenerous enough to force you to feign an interest which you\ndo not feel.”\n\n“Yes, I know you think me flippant and boyish,” retorted he, with sudden\nenergy, and tossing a stone down into the gulf below. “But, by the way,\nmy friend Strand, if he ever comes, would be just the man for you.\nHe has quite as many hobbies as you have, and, what is more, he has a\nprofound respect for hobbies in general, and is universally charitable\ntoward those of others.”\n\n“Your friend is a great man,” said the girl, earnestly. “I have read his\nbook on `The Wading Birds of the Norwegian Highlands,’ and none but a\ngreat man could have written it.”\n\n“He is an odd stick, but, for all that, a capital fellow; and I have no\ndoubt you would get on admirably with him.”\n\nAt this moment the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the\npastor’s man, Hans, who came to tell the “young miss” that there was\na big tramp hovering about the barns in the “out-fields,” where he\nhad been sleeping during the last three nights. He was a dangerous\ncharacter, Hans thought, at least judging from his looks, and it was\nhardly safe for the young miss to be roaming about the fields at night\nas long as he was in the neighborhood.\n\n“Why don’t you speak to the pastor, and have him arrested?” said\nArnfinn, impatient of Hans’s long-winded recital.\n\n“No, no, say nothing to father,” demanded Augusta, eagerly. “Why should\nyou arrest a poor man as long as he does nothing worse than sleep in the\nbarns in the out-fields?”\n\n“As you say, miss,” retorted Hans, and departed.\n\nThe moon came up pale and mist-like over the eastern mountain ridges,\nstruggled for a few brief moments feebly with the sunlight, and then\nvanished.\n\n“It is strange,” said Arnfinn, “how everything reminds me of Strand\nto-night. What gloriously absurd apostrophes to the moon he could make!\nI have not told you, cousin, of a very singular gift which he possesses.\nHe can attract all kinds of birds and wild animals to himself; he can\nimitate their voices, and they flock around him, as if he were one of\nthem, without fear of harm.”\n\n“How delightful,” cried Augusta, with sudden animation. “What a glorious\nman your friend must be!”\n\n“Because the snipes and the wild ducks like him? You seem to have\ngreater confidence in their judgment than in mine.”\n\n“Of course I have--at least as long as you persist in joking. But,\njesting aside, what a wondrously beautiful life he must lead whom\nNature takes thus into her confidence; who has, as it were, an inner and\nsubtler sense, corresponding to each grosser and external one; who is\nkeen-sighted enough to read the character of every individual beast, and\nhas ears sensitive to the full pathos of joy or sorrow in the song of\nthe birds that inhabit our woodlands.”\n\n“Whether he has any such second set of senses as you speak of, I\ndon’t know; but there can be no doubt that his familiarity, not to\nsay intimacy, with birds and beasts gives him a great advantage as a\nnaturalist. I suppose you know that his little book has been translated\ninto French, and rewarded with the gold medal of the Academy.”\n\n“Hush! What is that?” Augusta sprang up, and held her hand to her ear.\n\n“Some love-lorn mountain-cock playing yonder in the pine copse,”\n suggested Arnfinn, amused at his cousin’s eagerness.\n\n“You silly boy! Don’t you know the mountain-cock never plays except at\nsunrise?”\n\n“He would have a sorry time of it now, then, when there IS no sunrise.”\n\n“And so he has; he does not play except in early spring.”\n\nThe noise, at first faint, now grew louder. It began with a series of\nmellow, plaintive clucks that followed thickly one upon another, like\nsmooth pearls of sound that rolled through the throat in a continuous\ncurrent; then came a few sharp notes as of a large bird that snaps his\nbill; then a long, half-melodious rumbling, intermingled with cacklings\nand snaps, and at last, a sort of diminuendo movement of the same round,\npearly clucks. There was a whizzing of wing-beats in the air; two large\nbirds swept over their heads and struck down into the copse whence the\nsound had issued.\n\n“This is indeed a most singular thing,” said Augusta, under her breath,\nand with wide-eyed wonder. “Let us go nearer, and see what it can be.”\n\n“I am sure I can go if you can,” responded Arnfinn, not any too eagerly.\n“Give me your hand, and we can climb the better.”\n\nAs they approached the pine copse, which projected like a promontory\nfrom the line of the denser forest, the noise ceased, and only the\nplaintive whistling of a mountain-hen, calling her scattered young\ntogether, and now and then the shrill response of a snipe to the cry of\nits lonely mate, fell upon the summer night, not as an interruption, but\nas an outgrowth of the very silence. Augusta stole with soundless tread\nthrough the transparent gloom which lingered under those huge black\ncrowns, and Arnfinn followed impatiently after. Suddenly she motioned to\nhim to stand still, and herself bent forward in an attitude of surprise\nand eager observation. On the ground, some fifty steps from where she\nwas stationed, she saw a man stretched out full length, with a knapsack\nunder his head, and surrounded by a flock of downy, half-grown birds,\nwhich responded with a low, anxious piping to his alluring cluck, then\nscattered with sudden alarm, only to return again in the same curious,\ncautious fashion as before. Now and then there was a great flapping of\nwings in the trees overhead, and a heavy brown and black speckled\nmountain-hen alighted close to the man’s head, stretched out her neck\ntoward him, cocked her head, called her scattered brood together, and\ndeparted with slow and deliberate wing-beats.\n\nAgain there was a frightened flutter overhead, a shrill anxious whistle\nrose in the air, and all was silence. Augusta had stepped on a dry\nbranch--it had broken under her weight--hence the sudden confusion and\nflight. The unknown man had sprung up, and his eye, after a moment’s\nsearch, had found the dark, beautiful face peering forth behind the red\nfir-trunk. He did not speak or salute her; he greeted her with silent\njoy, as one greets a wondrous vision which is too frail and bright for\nconsciousness to grasp, which is lost the very instant one is conscious\nof seeing. But, while to the girl the sight, as it were, hung trembling\nin the range of mere physical perception, while its suddenness held it\naloof from moral reflection, there came a great shout from behind, and\nArnfinn, whom in her surprise she had quite forgotten, came bounding\nforward, grasping the stranger by the hand with much vigor,\nlaughing heartily, and pouring forth a confused stream of delighted\ninterjections, borrowed from all manner of classical and unclassical\ntongues.\n\n“Strand! Strand!” he cried, when the first tumult of excitement had\nsubsided; “you most marvelous and incomprehensible Strand! From\nwhat region of heaven or earth did you jump down into our prosaic\nneighborhood? And what in the world possessed you to choose our barns\nas the centre of your operations, and nearly put me to the necessity of\nhaving you arrested for vagrancy? How I do regret that Cousin Augusta’s\nentreaties mollified my heart toward you. Pardon me, I have not\nintroduced you. This is my cousin, Miss Oddson, and this is my\nmiraculous friend, the world-renowned author, vagrant, and naturalist,\nMr. Marcus Strand.”\n\nStrand stepped forward, made a deep but somewhat awkward bow, and was\ndimly aware that a small soft hand was extended to him, and, in the next\nmoment, was enclosed in his own broad and voluminous palm. He grasped it\nfirmly, and, in one of those profound abstractions into which he was\napt to fall when under the sway of a strong impression, pressed it with\nincreasing cordiality, while he endeavored to find fitting answers to\nArnfinn’s multifarious questions.\n\n“To tell the truth, Vording,” he said, in a deep, full-ringing bass,\n“I didn’t know that these were your cousin’s barns--I mean that your\nuncle”--giving the unhappy hand an emphatic shake--“inhabited these\nbarns.”\n\n“No, thank heaven, we are not quite reduced to that,” cried Arnfinn,\ngayly; “we still boast a parsonage, as you will presently discover,\nand a very bright and cozy one, to boot. But, whatever you do, have the\ngoodness to release Augusta’s hand. Don’t you see how desperately she is\nstruggling, poor thing?”\n\nStrand dropped the hand as if it had been a hot coal, blushed to the\nedge of his hair, and made another profound reverence. He was a tall,\nhuge-limbed youth, with a frame of gigantic mold, and a large, blonde,\nshaggy head, like that of some good-natured antediluvian animal, which\nmight feel the disadvantages of its size amid the puny beings of this\nlater stage of creation. There was a frank directness in his gaze, and\nan unconsciousness of self, which made him very winning, and which could\nnot fail of its effect upon a girl who, like Augusta, was fond of the\nuncommon, and hated smooth, facile and well-tailored young men, with\nthe labels of society and fashion upon their coats, their mustaches,\nand their speech. And Strand, with his large sun-burned face, his\nwild-growing beard, blue woolen shirt, top boots, and unkempt appearance\ngenerally, was a sufficiently startling phenomenon to satisfy even so\nexacting a fancy as hers; for, after reading his book about the\nWading Birds, she had made up her mind that he must have few points of\nresemblance to the men who had hitherto formed part of her own small\nworld, although she had not until now decided just in what way he was to\ndiffer.\n\n“Suppose I help you carry your knapsack,” said Arnfinn, who was flitting\nabout like a small nimble spaniel trying to make friends with some\nlarge, good-natured Newfoundland. “You must be very tired, having roamed\nabout in this Quixotic fashion!”\n\n“No, I thank you,” responded Strand, with an incredulous laugh, glancing\nalternately from Arnfinn to the knapsack, as if estimating their\nproportionate weight. “I am afraid you would rue your bargain if I\naccepted it.”\n\n“I suppose you have a great many stuffed birds at home,” remarked the\ngirl, looking with self-forgetful admiration at the large brawny figure.\n\n“No, I have hardly any,” answered he, seating himself on the ground,\nand pulling a thick note-book from his pocket. “I prefer live creatures.\nTheir anatomical and physiological peculiarities have been studied\nby others, and volumes have been written about them. It is their\npsychological traits, ii you will allow the expression, which interest\nme, and those I can only get at while they are alive.”\n\n“How delightful!”\n\nSome minutes later they were all on their way to the Parsonage. The sun,\nin spite of its mid-summer wakefulness, was getting red-eyed and drowsy,\nand the purple mists which hung in scattered fragments upon the forest\nbelow had lost something of their deep-tinged brilliancy. But Augusta,\nquite blind to the weakened light effects, looked out upon the broad\nlandscape in ecstasy, and, appealing to her more apathetic companions,\ninvited them to share her joy at the beauty of the faint-flushed summer\nnight.\n\n“You are getting quite dithyrambic, my dear,” remarked Arnfinn, with\nan air of cousinly superiority, which he felt was eminently becoming to\nhim; and Augusta looked up with quick surprise, then smiled in an absent\nway, and forgot what she had been saying. She had no suspicion but that\nher enthusiasm had been all for the sunset.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nIn a life so outwardly barren and monotonous as Augusta’s--a life in\nwhich the small external events were so firmly interwoven with the\nsubtler threads of yearnings, wants, and desires--the introduction of\nso large and novel a fact as Marcus Strand would naturally produce some\nperceptible result. It was that deplorable inward restlessness of hers,\nshe reasoned, which had hitherto made her existence seem so empty and\nunsatisfactory; but now his presence filled the hours, and the newness\nof his words, his manner, and his whole person afforded inexhaustible\nmaterial for thought. It was now a week since his arrival, and while\nArnfinn and Inga chatted at leisure, drew caricatures, or read aloud to\neach other in some shady nook of the garden, she and Strand would roam\nalong the beach, filling the vast unclouded horizon with large\nglowing images of the future of the human race. He always listened\nin sympathetic silence while she unfolded to him her often childishly\ndaring schemes for the amelioration of suffering and the righting of\nsocial wrongs; and when she had finished, and he met the earnest appeal\nof her dark eye, there would often be a pause, during which each, with\na half unconscious lapse from the impersonal, would feel more keenly the\njoy of this new and delicious mental companionship. And when at length\nhe answered, sometimes gently refuting and sometimes assenting to her\nproposition, it was always with a slow, deliberate earnestness, as if\nhe felt but her deep sincerity, and forgot for the moment her sex, her\nyouth, and her inexperience. It was just this kind of fellowship for\nwhich she had hungered so long, and her heart went out with a great\ngratitude toward this strong and generous man, who was willing to\nrecognize her humanity, and to respond with an ever-ready frankness,\nunmixed with petty suspicions and second thoughts, to the eager needs of\nher half-starved nature. It is quite characteristic, too, of the type of\nwomanhood which Augusta represents (and with which this broad continent\nof ours abounds), that, with her habitual disregard of appearances, she\nwould have scorned the notion that their intercourse had any ultimate\nend beyond that of mutual pleasure and instruction.\n\nIt was early in the morning in the third week of Strand’s stay at\nthe Parsonage. A heavy dew had fallen during the night, and each tiny\ngrass-blade glistened in the sun, bending under the weight of its liquid\ndiamond. The birds were improvising a miniature symphony in the\nbirches at the end of the garden; the song-thrush warbled with a sweet\nmelancholy his long-drawn contralto notes; the lark, like a prima donna,\nhovering conspicuously in mid air, poured forth her joyous soprano solo;\nand the robin, quite unmindful of the tempo, filled out the pauses with\nhis thoughtless staccato chirp. Augusta, who was herself the early bird\nof the pastor’s family, had paid a visit to the little bath-house\ndown at the brook, and was now hurrying homeward, her heavy black hair\nconfined in a delicate muslin hood, and her lithe form hastily wrapped\nin a loose morning gown. She had paused for a moment under the birches\nto listen to the song of the lark, when suddenly a low, half articulate\nsound, very unlike the voice of a bird, arrested her attention; she\nraised her eyes, and saw Strand sitting in the top of a tree, apparently\nconversing with himself, or with some tiny thing which he held in his\nhands.\n\n“Ah, yes, you poor little sickly thing!” she heard him mutter. “Don’t\nyou make such an ado now. You shall soon be quite well, if you will only\nmind what I tell you. Stop, stop! Take it easy. It is all for your own\ngood, you know. If you had only been prudent, and not stepped on your\nlame leg, you might have been spared this affliction. But, after all, it\nwas not your fault--it was that foolish little mother of yours. She will\nremember now that a skein of hemp thread is not the thing to line her\nnest with. If she doesn’t, you may tell her that it was I who said so.”\n\nAugusta stood gazing on in mute astonishment; then, suddenly remembering\nher hasty toilet, she started to run; but, as chance would have it, a\ndry branch, which hung rather low, caught at her hood, and her hair fell\nin a black wavy stream down over her shoulders. She gave a little\ncry, the tree shook violently, and Strand was at her side. She blushed\ncrimson over neck and face, and, in her utter bewilderment, stood like a\nculprit before him, unable to move, unable to speak, and only returning\nwith a silent bow his cordial greeting. It seemed to her that she had\nungenerously intruded upon his privacy, watching him, while he thought\nhimself unobserved. And Augusta was quite unskilled in those social\naccomplishments which enable young ladies to hide their inward emotions\nunder a show of polite indifference, for, however hard she strove,\nshe could not suppress a slight quivering of her lips, and her intense\nself-reproach made Strand’s words fall dimly on her ears, and prevented\nher from gathering the meaning of what he was saying. He held in his\nhands a young bird with a yellow line along the edge of its bill (and\nthere was something beautifully soft and tender in the way those large\npalms of his handled any living thing), and he looked pityingly at it\nwhile he spoke.\n\n“The mother of this little linnet,” he said, smiling, “did what\nmany foolish young mothers are apt to do. She took upon her the\nresponsibility of raising offspring without having acquired the\nnecessary knowledge of housekeeping. So she lined her nest with hemp,\nand the consequence was, that her first-born got his legs entangled, and\nwas obliged to remain in the nest long after his wings had reached their\nfull development. I saw her feeding him about a week ago, and, as my\ncuriosity prompted me to look into the case, I released the little\ncripple, cleansed the deep wound which the threads had cut in his flesh,\nand have since been watching him during his convalescence. Now he is\nquite in a fair way, but I had to apply some salve, and to cut off the\nfeathers about the wound, and the little fool squirmed under the pain,\nand grew rebellious. Only notice this scar, if you please, Miss Oddson,\nand you may imagine what the poor thing must have suffered.”\n\nAugusta gave a start; she timidly raised her eyes, and saw Strand’s\ngrave gaze fixed upon her. She felt as if some intolerable spell had\ncome over her, and, as her agitation increased, her power of speech\nseemed utterly to desert her.\n\n“Ah, you have not been listening to me?” said Strand, in a tone of\nwondering inquiry. “Pardon me for presuming to believe that my little\ninvalid could be as interesting to you as he is to me.”\n\n“Mr. Strand,” stammered the girl, while the invisible tears came near\nchoking her voice. “Mr. Strand--I didn’t mean--really--”\n\nShe knew that if she said another word she should burst into tears. With\na violent effort, she gathered up her wrapper, which somehow had got\nunbuttoned at the neck, and, with heedlessly hurrying steps, darted away\ntoward the house.\n\nStrand stood looking after her, quite unmindful of his feathered\npatient, which flew chirping about him in the grass. Two hours later\nArnfinn found him sitting under the birches with his hands clasped\nover the top of his head, and his surgical instruments scattered on the\nground around him.\n\n“Corpo di Baccho,” exclaimed the student, stooping to pick up the\nprecious tools; “have you been amputating your own head, or is it I who\nam dreaming?”\n\n“Ah,” murmured Strand, lifting a large, strange gaze upon his friend,\n“is it you?”\n\n“Who else should it be? I come to call you to breakfast.”\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n“I wonder what is up between Strand and Augusta?” said Arnfinn to his\ncousin Inga. The questioner was lying in the grass at her feet, resting\nhis chin on his palms, and gazing with roguishly tender eyes up into\nher fresh, blooming face; but Inga, who was reading aloud from “David\nCopperfield,” and was deep in the matrimonial tribulations of that noble\nhero, only said “hush,” and continued reading. Arnfinn, after a minute’s\nsilence, repeated his remark, whereupon his fair cousin wrenched his\ncane out of his hand, and held it threateningly over his head.\n\n“Will you be a good boy and listen?” she exclaimed, playfully\nemphasizing each word with a light rap on his curly pate.\n\n“Ouch! that hurts,” cried Arnfinn, and dodged.\n\n“It was meant to hurt,” replied Inga, with mock severity, and returned\nto “Copperfield.”\n\nPresently the seed of a corn-flower struck the tip of her nose, and\nagain the cane was lifted; but Dora’s housekeeping experiences were\ntoo absorbingly interesting, and the blue eyes could not resist their\nfascination.\n\n“Cousin Inga,” said Arnfinn, and this time with as near an approach\nto earnestness as he was capable of at that moment, “I do believe that\nStrand is in love with Augusta.”\n\nInga dropped the book, and sent him what was meant to be a glance of\nsevere rebuke, and then said, in her own amusingly emphatic way:\n\n“I do wish you wouldn’t joke with such things, Arnfinn.”\n\n“Joke! Indeed I am not joking. I wish to heaven that I were. What a pity\nit is that she has taken such a dislike to him!”\n\n“Dislike! Oh, you are a profound philosopher, you are! You think that\nbecause she avoids--”\n\nHere Inga abruptly clapped her hand over her mouth, and, with sudden\nchange of voice and expression, said:\n\n“I am as silent as the grave.”\n\n“Yes, you are wonderfully discreet,” cried Arnfinn, laughing, while the\ngirl bit her under lip with an air of penitence and mortification which,\nin any other bosom than a cousin’s would have aroused compassion.\n\n“Aha! So steht’s!” he broke forth, with another burst of merriment;\nthen, softened by the sight of a tear that was slowly gathering beneath\nher eyelashes, he checked his laughter, crept up to her side, and in a\nhalf childishly coaxing, half caressing tone, he whispered:\n\n“Dear little cousin, indeed I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. You are\nnot angry with me, are you? And if you will only promise me not to tell,\nI have something here which I should like to show you.”\n\nHe well knew that there was nothing which would sooner soothe Inga’s\nwrath than confiding a secret to her; and while he was a boy, he had,\nin cases of sore need, invented secrets lest his life should be made\nmiserable by the sense that she was displeased with him. In this\ninstance her anger was not strong enough to resist the anticipation of\na secret, probably relating to that little drama which had, during\nthe last weeks, been in progress under her very eyes. With a resolute\nmovement, she brushed her tears away, bent eagerly forward, and, in the\nnext moment, her face was all expectancy and animation.\n\nArnfinn pulled a thick black note-book from his breast pocket, opened it\nin his lap, and read:\n\n“August 3, 5 A. M.--My little invalid is doing finely; he seemed to\nrelish much a few dozen flies which I brought him in my hand. His pulse\nis to-day, for the first time, normal. He is beginning to step on the\ninjured leg without apparent pain.\n\n“10 A. M.--Miss Augusta’s eyes have a strange, lustrous brilliancy\nwhenever she speaks of subjects which seem to agitate the depths of\nher being. How and why is it that an excessive amount of feeling always\nfinds its first expression in the eye? One kind of emotion seems to\nwiden the pupil, another kind to contract it. TO be noticed in future,\nhow particular emotions affect the eye.\n\n“6 P. M.--I met a plover on the beach this afternoon. By imitating his\ncry, I induced him to come within a few feet of me. The plover, as\nhis cry indicates, is a very melancholy bird. In fact I believe the\nmelancholy temperament to be prevailing among the wading birds, as\nthe phlegmatic among birds of prey. The singing birds are choleric\nor sanguine. Tease a thrush, or even a lark, and you will soon be\nconvinced. A snipe, or plover, as far as my experience goes, seldom\nshows anger; you cannot tease them. To be considered, how far the voice\nof a bird may be indicative of its temperament.\n\n“August 5, 9 P. M.--Since the unfortunate meeting yesterday morning,\nwhen my intense pre-occupation with my linnet, which had torn its wound\nopen again, probably made me commit some breach of etiquette, Miss\nAugusta avoids me.\n\n“August 7--I am in a most singular state. My pulse beats 85, which is\na most unheard-of thing for me, as my pulse is naturally full and slow.\nAnd, strangely enough, I do not feel at all unwell. On the contrary, my\nphysical well-being is rather heightened than otherwise. The life of a\nwhole week is crowded into a day, and that of a day into an hour.”\n\nInga, who, at several points of this narrative, had been struggling hard\nto preserve her gravity, here burst into a ringing laugh.\n\n“That is what I call scientific love-making,” said Arnfinn, looking up\nfrom the book with an expression of subdued amusement.\n\n“But Arnfinn,” cried the girl, while the laughter quickly died out of\nher face, “does Mr. Strand know that you are reading this?”\n\n“To be sure he does. And that is just what to my mind makes the\nsituation so excessively comical. He has himself no suspicion that this\nbook contains anything but scientific notes. He appears to prefer the\nempiric method in love as in philosophy. I verily believe that he is\ninnocently experimenting with himself, with a view to making some great\nphysiological discovery.”\n\n“And so he will, perhaps,” rejoined the girl, the mixture of gayety and\ngrave solicitude making her face, as her cousin thought, particularly\ncharming.\n\n“Only not a physiological, but possibly a psychological one,” remarked\nArnfinn. “But listen to this. Here is something rich:\n\n“August 9--Miss Augusta once said something about the possibility of\nanimals being immortal. Her eyes shone with a beautiful animation as she\nspoke. I am longing to continue the subject with her. It haunts me\nthe whole day long. There may be more in the idea than appears to a\nsuperficial observer.”\n\n“Oh, how charmingly he understands how to deceive himself,” cried Inga.\n\n“Merely a quid pro quo,” said Arnfinn.\n\n“I know what I shall do!”\n\n“And so do I.”\n\n“Won’t you tell me, please?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then I sha’n’t tell you either.”\n\nAnd they flew apart like two thoughtless little birds (“sanguine,” as\nStrand would have called them), each to ponder on some formidable plot\nfor the reconciliation of the estranged lovers.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nDuring the week that ensued, the multifarious sub-currents of Strand’s\npassion seemed slowly to gather themselves into one clearly defined\nstream, and, after much scientific speculation, he came to the\nconclusion that he loved Augusta. In a moment of extreme discouragement,\nhe made a clean breast of it to Arnfinn, at the same time informing him\nthat he had packed his knapsack, and would start on his wanderings again\nthe next morning. All his friend’s entreaties were in vain; he would and\nmust go. Strand was an exasperatingly headstrong fellow, and persuasions\nnever prevailed with him. He had confirmed himself in the belief that he\nwas very unattractive to women, and that Augusta, of all women, for\nsome reason which was not quite clear to him, hated and abhorred him.\nInexperienced as he was, he could see no reason why she should avoid\nhim, if she did not hate him. They sat talking until midnight, each\nentangling himself in those passionate paradoxes and contradictions\npeculiar to passionate and impulsive youth. Strand paced the floor with\nlarge steps, pouring out his long pent-up emotion in violent tirades\nof self-accusation and regret; while Arnfinn sat on the bed, trying to\nsoothe his excitement by assuring him that he was not such a monster as,\nfor the moment, he had believed himself to be, but only succeeding,\nin spite of all his efforts, in pouring oil on the flames. Strand\nwas scientifically convinced that Nature, in accordance with some\ninscrutable law of equilibrium, had found it necessary to make him\nphysically unattractive, perhaps to indemnify mankind for that excess of\nintellectual gifts which, at the expense of the race at large, she had\nbestowed upon him.\n\nEarly the next morning, as a kind of etherealized sunshine broke\nthrough the white muslin curtains of Arnfinn’s room, and long streaks\nof sun-illumined dust stole through the air toward the sleeper’s pillow,\nthere was a sharp rap at the door, and Strand entered. His knapsack was\nstrapped over his shoulders, his long staff was in his hand, and there\nwas an expression of conscious martyrdom in his features. Arnfinn\nraised himself on his elbows, and rubbed his eyes with a desperate\ndetermination to get awake, but only succeeded in gaining a very dim\nimpression of a beard, a blue woolen shirt, and a disproportionately\nlarge shoe buckle. The figure advanced to the bed, extended a broad,\nsun-burned hand, and a deep bass voice was heard to say:\n\n“Good-bye, brother.”\n\nArnfinn, who was a hard sleeper, gave another rub, and, in a querulously\nsleepy tone, managed to mutter:\n\n“Why,--is it as late as that--already?”\n\nThe words of parting were more remotely repeated, the hand closed about\nArnfinn’s half-unfeeling fingers, the lock on the door gave a little\nsharp click, and all was still. But the sunshine drove the dust in a\ndumb, confused dance through the room.\n\nSome four hours later, Arnfinn woke up with a vague feeling as if some\ngreat calamity had happened; he was not sure but that he had slept a\nfortnight or more. He dressed with a sleepy, reckless haste, being but\ndimly conscious of the logic of the various processes of ablution which\nhe underwent. He hurried up to Strand’s room, but, as he had expected,\nfound it empty.\n\nDuring all the afternoon, the reading of “David Copperfield” was\ninterrupted by frequent mutual condolences, and at times Inga’s hand\nwould steal up to her eye to brush away a treacherous tear. But then she\nonly read the faster, and David and Agnes were already safe in the\nhaven of matrimony before either she or Arnfinn was aware that they\nhad struggled successfully through the perilous reefs and quicksands of\ncourtship.\n\nAugusta excused herself from supper, Inga’s forced devices at merriment\nwere too transparent, Arnfinn’s table-talk was of a rambling, incoherent\nsort, and he answered dreadfully malapropos, if a chance word was\naddressed to him, and even the good-natured pastor began, at last, to\ngrumble; for the inmates of the Gran Parsonage seemed to have but one\nlife and one soul in common, and any individual disturbance immediately\ndisturbed the peace and happiness of the whole household. Now gloom\nhad, in some unaccountable fashion, obscured the common atmosphere. Inga\nshook her small wise head, and tried to extract some little consolation\nfrom the consciousness that she knew at least some things which Arnfinn\ndid not know, and which it would be very unsafe to confide to him.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nFour weeks after Strand’s departure, as the summer had already assumed\nthat tinge of sadness which impresses one as a foreboding of coming\ndeath, Augusta was walking along the beach, watching the flight of\nthe sea-birds. Her latest “aberration,” as Arnfinn called it, was an\nextraordinary interest in the habits of the eider-ducks, auks, and\nsea-gulls, the noisy monotony of whose existence had, but a few months\nago, appeared to her the symbol of all that was vulgar and coarse\nin human and animal life. Now she had even provided herself with a\nnote-book, and (to use once more the language of her unbelieving cousin)\naffected a half-scientific interest in their clamorous pursuits. She had\nmade many vain attempts to imitate their voices and to beguile them\ninto closer intimacy, and had found it hard at times to suppress her\nindignation when they persisted in viewing her in the light of an\nintruder, and in returning her amiable approaches with shy suspicion, as\nif they doubted the sincerity of her intentions.\n\nShe was a little paler now, perhaps, than before, but her eyes had still\nthe same lustrous depth, and the same sweet serenity was still diffused\nover her features, and softened, like a pervading tinge of warm color,\nthe grand simplicity of her presence. She sat down on a large rock,\npicked up a curiously twisted shell, and seeing a plover wading in the\nsurf, gave a soft, low whistle, which made the bird turn round and gaze\nat her with startled distrust. She repeated the call, but perhaps a\nlittle too eagerly, and the bird spread its wings with a frightened cry,\nand skimmed, half flying, half running, out over the glittering surface\nof the fjord. But from the rocks close by came a long melancholy whistle\nlike that of a bird in distress, and the girl rose and hastened with\neager steps toward the spot. She climbed up on a stone, fringed all\naround with green slimy seaweeds, in order to gain a wider view of the\nbeach. Then suddenly some huge figure started up between the rocks at\nher feet; she gave a little scream, her foot slipped, and in the next\nmoment she lay--in Strand’s arms. He offered no apology, but silently\ncarried her over the slippery stones, and deposited her tenderly upon\nthe smooth white sand. There it occurred to her that his attention\nwas quite needless, but at the moment she was too startled to make any\nremonstrance.\n\n“But how in the world, Mr. Strand, did you come here?” she managed at\nlast to stammer. “We all thought that you had gone away.”\n\n“I hardly know myself,” said Strand, in a beseeching undertone, quite\ndifferent from his usual confident bass. “I only know that--that I was\nvery wretched, and that I had to come back.”\n\nThen there was a pause, which to both seemed quite interminable, and, in\norder to fill it out in some way, Strand began to move his head and arms\nuneasily, and at length seated himself at Augusta’s side. The blood was\nbeating with feverish vehemence in her temples, and for the first time\nin her life she felt something akin to pity for this large, strong man,\nwhose strength and cheerful self-reliance had hitherto seemed to\nraise him above the need of a woman’s aid and sympathy. Now the very\nshabbiness of his appearance, and the look of appealing misery in his\nfeatures, opened in her bosom the gate through which compassion could\nenter, and, with that generous self-forgetfulness which was the chief\nfactor of her character, she leaned over toward him, and said:\n\n“You must have been very sick, Mr. Strand. Why did you not come to us\nand allow us to take care of you, instead of roaming about here in this\nstony wilderness?”\n\n“Yes; I have been sick,” cried Strand, with sudden vehemence, seizing\nher hand; “but it is a sickness of which I shall never, never be\nhealed.”\n\nAnd with that world-old eloquence which is yet ever new, he poured forth\nhis passionate confession in her ear, and she listened, hungrily at\nfirst, then with serene, wide-eyed happiness. He told her how, driven by\nhis inward restlessness, he had wandered about in the mountains, until\none evening at a saeter, he had heard a peasant lad singing a song, in\nwhich this stanza occurred:\n\n     “A woman’s frown, a woman’s smile,\n          Nor hate nor fondness prove;\n       For maidens smile on him they hate,\n          And fly from him they love.”\n\n\nThen it had occurred to him for the first time in his life that a\nwoman’s behavior need not be the logical indicator of her deepest\nfeelings, and, enriched with this joyful discovery, inspired with new\nhope, he had returned, but had not dared at once to seek the Parsonage,\nuntil he could invent some plausible reason for his return; but his\nimagination was very poor, and he had found none, except that he loved\nthe pastor’s beautiful daughter.\n\nThe evening wore on. The broad mountain-guarded valley, flooded now to\nthe brim with a soft misty light, spread out about them, and filled\nthem with a delicious sense of security. The fjord lifted its grave gaze\ntoward the sky, and deepened responsively with a bright, ever-receding\nimmensity. The young girl felt this blessed peace gently stealing over\nher; doubt and struggle were all past, and the sun shone ever serene and\nunobscured upon the widening expanses of the future. And in his breast,\ntoo, that mood reigned in which life looks boundless and radiant, human\nwoes small or impossible, and one’s own self large and all-conquering.\nIn that hour they remodeled this old and obstinate world of ours, never\ndoubting that, if each united his faith and strength with the other’s,\nthey could together lift its burden.\n\nThat night was the happiest and most memorable night in the history of\nthe Gran Parsonage. The pastor walked up and down on the floor,\nrubbing his hands in quiet contentment. Inga, to whom an engagement was\nessentially a solemn affair, sat in a corner and gazed at her sister and\nStrand with tearful radiance. Arnfinn gave vent to his joy by bestowing\nembraces promiscuously upon whomsoever chanced to come in his way.\n\nThis story, however, has a brief but not unimportant sequel. It was not\nmany weeks after this happy evening that Arnfinn and the maiden with the\n“amusingly unclassical nose” presented themselves in the pastor’s study\nand asked for his paternal and unofficial blessing. But the pastor, I\nam told, grew very wroth, and demanded that his nephew should first\ntake his second and third degrees, attaching, besides, some very odious\nstipulations regarding average in study and college standing, before\nthere could be any talk about engagement or matrimony. So, at present,\nArnfinn is still studying, and the fair-haired Inga is still waiting.\n\n\n\n\nTRULS, THE NAMELESS.\n\nHE was born in the houseman’s lodge; she in the great mansion. He did\nnot know who his father was; she was the daughter of Grim of Skogli, and\nshe was the only daughter he had. They were carried to baptism on\nthe same day, and he was called Truls, because they had to call him\nsomething; she received the name of Borghild, because that had been the\nname of every eldest born daughter in the family for thirty generations.\nThey both cried when the pastor poured the water on their heads; his\nmother hushed him, blushed, and looked timidly around her; but the woman\nwho carried Borghild lifted her high up in her arms so that everybody\ncould see her, and the pastor smiled benignly, and the parishioners said\nthat they had never seen so beautiful a child. That was the way in which\nthey began life--he as a child of sin, she as the daughter of a mighty\nrace.\n\nThey grew up together. She had round cheeks and merry eyes, and her lips\nwere redder than the red rose. He was of slender growth, his face was\nthin and pale, and his eyes had a strange, benumbed gaze, as if they\nwere puzzling themselves with some sad, life-long riddle which they\nnever hoped to solve. On the strand where they played the billows came\nand went, and they murmured faintly with a sound of infinite remoteness.\nBorghild laughed aloud, clapped her hands and threw stones out into\nthe water, while he sat pale and silent, and saw the great white-winged\nsea-birds sailing through the blue ocean of the sky.\n\n“How would you like to live down there in the deep green water?” she\nasked him one day, as they sat watching the eider-ducks which swam and\ndived, and stood on their heads among the sea-weeds.\n\n“I should like it very well,” he answered, “if you would follow me.”\n\n“No, I won’t follow you,” she cried. “It is cold and wet down in the\nwater. And I should spoil the ribbons on my new bodice. But when I grow\nup and get big and can braid my hair, then I shall row with the young\nlads to the church yonder on the headland, and there the old pastor will\nmarry me, and I shall wear the big silver crown which my mother wore\nwhen she was married.”\n\n“And may I go with you?” asked he, timidly.\n\n“Yes, you may steer my boat and be my helmsman, or--you may be my\nbridegroom, if you would like that better.”\n\n“Yes, I think I should rather be your bridegroom,” and he gave her a\nlong, strange look which almost frightened her.\n\nThe years slipped by, and before Borghild knew it, she had grown into\nwomanhood. The down on Truls’s cheeks became rougher, and he, too, began\nto suspect that he was no longer a boy. When the sun was late and the\nbreeze murmured in the great, dark-crowned pines, they often met by\nchance, at the well, on the strand, or on the saeter-green. And the\noftener they met the more they found to talk about; to be sure, it was\nshe who did the talking, and he looked at her with his large wondering\neyes and listened. She told him of the lamb which had tumbled down\nover a steep precipice and still was unhurt, of the baby who pulled\nthe pastor’s hair last Sunday during the baptismal ceremony, or of the\nlumberman, Lars, who drank the kerosene his wife gave him for brandy,\nand never knew the difference. But, when the milkmaids passed by, she\nwould suddenly forget what she had been saying, and then they sat gazing\nat each other in silence. Once she told him of the lads who danced with\nher at the party at Houg; and she thought she noticed a deeper color on\nhis face, and that he clinched both his fists and--thrust them into\nhis pockets. That set her thinking, and the more she thought, the more\ncurious she grew. He played the violin well; suppose she should ask him\nto come and fiddle at the party her father was to give at the end of the\nharvest. She resolved to do it, and he, not knowing what moved her,\ngave his promise eagerly. It struck her, afterward, that she had done\na wicked thing, but, like most girls, she had not the heart to wrestle\nwith an uncomfortable thought; she shook it off and began to hum a\nsnatch of an old song.\n\n     “O’er the billows the fleet-footed storm-wind rode,\n       The billows blue are the merman’s abode,\n       So strangely that harp was sounding.”\n\n\nThe memory of old times came back to her, the memory of the morning long\nyears ago, when they sat together on the strand, and he said; “I think I\nwould rather be your bridegroom, Borghild.” The memory was sweet but it\nwas bitter too; and the bitterness rose and filled her heart. She threw\nher head back proudly, and laughed a strange, hollow laugh. “A bastard’s\nbride, ha, ha! A fine tale were that for the parish gossips.” A yellow\nbutterfly lighted on her arm, and with a fierce frown on her face she\ncaught it between her fingers. Then she looked pityingly on the dead\nwings, as they lay in her hand, and murmured between her teeth: “Poor\nthing! Why did you come in my way, unbidden?”\n\nThe harvest was rich, and the harvest party was to keep pace with the\nharvest. The broad Skogli mansion was festively lighted (for it was\nalready late in September); the tall, straight tallow candles, stuck in\nmany-armed candlesticks, shone dimly through a sort of misty halo, and\nonly suffused the dusk with a faint glimmering of light. And every\ntime a guest entered, the flames of the candles flickered and twisted\nthemselves with the wind, struggling to keep erect. And Borghild’s\ncourage, too, rose and fell with the flickering motion of a flame which\nwrestles with the wind. Whenever the latch clicked she lifted her eyes\nand looked for Truls, and one moment she wished that she might never\nsee his face again, and in the next she sent an eager glance toward\nthe door. Presently he came, threw his fiddle on a bench, and with a\nreckless air walked up to her and held out his hand. She hesitated to\nreturn his greeting, but when she saw the deep lines of suffering in\nhis face, her heart went forward with a great tenderness toward him,\na tenderness such as one feels for a child who is sick, and suffers\nwithout hope of healing. She laid her hand in his, and there it lay for\na while listlessly; for neither dared trust the joy which the sight of\nthe other enkindled. But when she tried to draw her hand away, he caught\nit quickly, and with a sudden fervor of voice he said:\n\n“The sight of you, Borghild, stills the hunger which is raging in my\nsoul. Beware that you do not play with a life, Borghild, even though it\nbe a worthless one.”\n\nThere was something so hopelessly sad in his words, that they stung her\nto the quick. They laid bare a hidden deep in her heart, and she shrank\nback st the sight of her own vileness. How could she repair the injury\nshe had done him? How could she heal the wound she had inflicted? A\nnumber of guests came up to greet her and among them Syvert Stein, a\nbold-looking young man, who, during that summer, had led her frequently\nin the dance. He had a square face, strong features, and a huge crop of\ntowy hair. His race was far-famed for wit and daring.\n\n“Tardy is your welcome, Borghild of Skogli,” quoth he. “But what a faint\nheart does not give a bold hand can grasp, and what I am not offered I\ntake unbidden.”\n\nSo saying, he flung his arm about her waist, lifted her from the floor\nand put her down in the middle of the room. Truls stood and gazed at\nthem with large, bewildered eyes. He tried hard to despise the braggart,\nbut ended with envying him.\n\n“Ha, fiddler, strike up a tune that shall ring through marrow and bone,”\n shouted Syvert Stein, who struck the floor with his heels and moved his\nbody to the measure of a spring-dance.\n\nTruls still followed them with his eyes; suddenly he leaped up, and\na wild thought burned in his breast. But with an effort he checked\nhimself, grasped his violin, and struck a wailing chord of lament. Then\nhe laid his ear close to the instrument, as if he were listening to\nsome living voice hidden there within, ran warily with the bow over the\nstrings, and warbled, and caroled, and sang with maddening glee, and\nstill with a shivering undercurrent of woe. And the dusk which slept\nupon the black rafters was quickened and shook with the weird sound;\nevery pulse in the wide hall beat more rapidly, and every eye kindled\nwith a bolder fire. Pressently{sic} a Strong male voice sang out to the\nmeasure of the violin:\n\n\n     “Come, fairest maid, tread the dance with me;\n                    O heigh ho!”\n\n     And a clear, tremulous treble answered:\n\n     “So gladly tread I the dance with thee;\n                    O heigh ho!”\n\n\nTruls knew the voices only too well; it was Syvert Stein and Borghild\nwho were singing a stave. [8]\n\n     Syvert--Like brier-roses thy red cheeks blush,\n     Borghild--And thine are rough like the thorny bush;\n                    Both--An’ a heigho!\n\n     Syvert--So fresh and green is the sunny lea;\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Borghild--The fiddle twangeth so merrily;\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Syvert--So lightly goeth the lusty reel,\n     Borghild--And round we whirl like a spinning-wheel;\n                    Both--An’ a heigho!\n\n     Syvert--Thine eyes are bright like the sunny fjord;\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Borghild--And thine do flash like a Viking’s sword;\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Syvert--So lightly trippeth thy foot along,\n     Borghild--The air is teeming with joyful song;\n                    Both--An’ a heigh ho!\n\n     Syvert--Then fairest maid, while the woods are green,\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Borghild--And thrushes sing the fresh leaves between;\n                    O heigh ho!\n     Syvert--Come, let us dance in the gladsome day,\n     Borghild--Dance hate, and sorrow, and care away;\n                    Both--An’ a heigh ho!\n\n\nThe stave was at an end. The hot and flushed dancers straggled over the\nfloor by twos and threes, and the big beer-horns were passed from hand\nto hand. Truls sat in his corner hugging his violin tightly to\nhis bosom, only to do something, for he was vaguely afraid of\nhimself--afraid of the thoughts that might rise--afraid of the deed they\nmight prompt. He ran his fingers over his forehead, but he hardly\nfelt the touch of his own hand. It was as if something was dead within\nhim--as if a string had snapped in his breast, and left it benumbed and\nvoiceless.\n\nPresently he looked up and saw Borghild standing before him; she held\nher arms akimbo, her eyes shone with a strange light, and her features\nwore an air of recklessness mingled with pity.\n\n“Ah, Borghild, is it you?” said he, in a hoarse voice. “What do you want\nwith me? I thought you had done with me now.”\n\n“You are a very unwitty fellow,” answered she, with a forced laugh. “The\nbranch that does not bend must break.”\n\nShe turned quickly on her heel and was lost in the crowd. He sat long\npondering on her words, but their meaning remained hidden to him. The\nbranch that does not bend must break. Was he the branch, and must he\nbend or break? By-and-by he put his hands on his knees, rose with a\nslow, uncertain motion, and stalked heavily toward the door. The fresh\nnight air would do him good. The thought breathes more briskly in God’s\nfree nature, under the broad canopy of heaven. The white mist rose from\nthe fields, and made the valley below appear like a white sea whose\nnearness you feel, even though you do not see it. And out of the mist\nthe dark pines stretched their warning hands against the sky, and the\nmoon was swimming, large and placid, between silvery islands of cloud.\nTruls began to beat his arms against his sides, and felt the warm blood\nspreading from his heart and thawing the numbness of his limbs. Not\ncaring whither he went, he struck the path leading upward to the\nmountains. He took to humming an old air which happened to come into his\nhead, only to try if there was life enough left in him to sing. It was\nthe ballad of Young Kirsten and the Merman:\n\n “The billows fall and the billows swell,\n   In the night so lone,\n   In the billows blue doth the merman dwell,\n   And strangely that harp was sounding.”\n\n\nHe walked on briskly for a while, and, looking back upon the pain he had\nendured but a moment ago, he found it quite foolish and irrational. An\nabsurd merriment took possession of him; but all the while he did\nnot know where his foot stepped; his head swam, and his pulse beat\nfeverishly. About midway between the forest and the mansion, where the\nfield sloped more steeply, grew a clump of birch-trees, whose slender\nstems glimmered ghostly white in the moonlight. Something drove Truls to\nleave the beaten road, and, obeying the impulse, he steered toward the\nbirches. A strange sound fell upon his ear, like the moan of one in\ndistress. It did not startle him; indeed, he was in a mood when nothing\ncould have caused him wonder. If the sky had suddenly tumbled down upon\nhim, with moon and all, he would have taken it as a matter of course.\nPeering for a moment through the mist, he discerned the outline of a\nhuman figure. With three great strides he reached the birch-tree; at\nhis feet sat Borghild rocking herself to and fro and weeping piteously.\nWithout a word he seated himself at her side and tried to catch a\nglimpse of her face; but she hid it from him and went on sobbing. Still\nthere could be no doubt that it was Borghild--one hour ago so merry,\nreckless, and defiant, now cowering at his feet and weeping like a\nbroken-hearted child.\n\n“Borghild,” he said, at last, putting his arm gently about her waist,\n“you and I, I think, played together when we were children.”\n\n“So we did, Truls,” answered she, struggling with her tears.\n\n“And as we grew up, we spent many a pleasant hour with each other.”\n\n“Many a pleasant hour.”\n\nShe raised her head, and he drew her more closely to him.\n\n“But since then I have done you a great wrong,” began she, after a\nwhile.\n\n“Nothing done that cannot yet be undone,” he took heart to answer.\n\nIt was long before her thoughts took shape, and, when at length they\ndid, she dared not give them utterance. Nevertheless, she was all the\ntime conscious of one strong desire, from which her conscience shrank as\nfrom a crime; and she wrestled ineffectually with her weakness until her\nweakness prevailed.\n\n“I am glad you came,” she faltered. “I knew you would come. There was\nsomething I wished to say to you.”\n\n“And what was it, Borghild?”\n\n“I wanted to ask you to forgive me--”\n\n“Forgive you--”\n\nHe sprang up as if something had stung him.\n\n“And why not?” she pleaded, piteously.\n\n“Ah, girl, you know not what you ask,” cried he, with a sternness which\nstartled her. “If I had more than one life to waste--but you caress with\none hand and stab with the other. Fare thee well, Borghild, for here our\npaths separate.”\n\nHe turned his back upon her and began to descend the slope.\n\n“For God’s sake, stay, Truls,” implored she, and stretched her arms\nappealingly toward him; “tell me, oh, tell me all.”\n\nWith a leap he was again at her side, stooped down over her, and, in a\nhoarse, passionate whisper, spoke the secret of his life in her ear. She\ngazed for a moment steadily into his face, then, in a few hurried words,\nshe pledged him her love, her faith, her all. And in the stillness of\nthat summer night they planned together their flight to a greater and\nfreer land, where no world-old prejudice frowned upon the union of two\nkindred souls. They would wait in patience and silence until spring;\nthen come the fresh winds from the ocean, and, with them, the birds of\npassage which awake the longings in the Norsemen’s breasts, and the\nAmerican vessels which give courage to many a sinking spirit, strength\nto the wearied arm, hope to the hopeless heart.\n\nDuring that winter Truls and Borghild seldom saw each other. The parish\nwas filled with rumors, and after the Christmas holiday it was told for\ncertain that the proud maiden of Skogli had been promised in marriage to\nSyvert Stein. It was the general belief that the families had made the\nmatch, and that Borghild, at least, had hardly had any voice in the\nmatter. Another report was that she had flatly refused to listen to any\nproposal from that quarter, and that, when she found that resistance was\nvain, she had cried three days and three nights, and refused to take any\nfood. When this rumor reached the pastor’s ear, he pronounced it an\nidle tale; “for,” said he, “Borghild has always been a proper and\nwell-behaved maiden, and she knows that she must honor father and\nmother, that it may be well with her, and she live long upon the land.”\n\nBut Borghild sat alone in her gable window and looked longingly toward\nthe ocean. The glaciers glittered, the rivers swelled, the buds of the\nforest burst, and great white sails began to glimmer on the far western\nhorizon.\n\nIf Truls, the Nameless, as scoffers were wont to call him, had been a\ngreater personage in the valley, it would, no doubt, have shocked the\ngossips to know that one fine morning he sold his cow, his gun and his\ndog, and wrapped sixty silver dollars in a leathern bag, which he sewed\nfast to the girdle he wore about his waist. That same night some one was\nheard playing wildly up in the birch copse above the Skogli mansion; now\nit sounded like a wail of distress, then like a fierce, defiant laugh,\nand now again the music seemed to hush itself into a heart-broken,\nsorrowful moan, and the people crossed themselves, and whispered: “Our\nFather;” but Borghild sat at her gable window and listened long to the\nweird strain. The midnight came, but she stirred not. With the hour\nof midnight the music ceased. From the windows of hall and kitchen the\nlight streamed out into the damp air, and the darkness stood like a wall\non either side; within, maids and lads were busy brewing, baking, and\nwashing, for in a week there was to be a wedding on the farm.\n\nThe week went and the wedding came. Truls had not closed his eyes all\nthat night, and before daybreak he sauntered down along the beach and\ngazed out upon the calm fjord, where the white-winged sea-birds whirled\nin great airy surges around the bare crags. Far up above the noisy\nthrong an ospray sailed on the blue expanse of the sky, and quick as\nthought swooped down upon a halibut which had ventured to take a peep\nat the rising sun. The huge fish struggled for a moment at the water’s\nedge, then, with a powerful stroke of its tail, which sent the spray\nhissing through the air, dived below the surface. The bird of prey gave\na loud scream, flapped fiercely with its broad wings, and for several\nminutes a thickening cloud of applauding ducks and seagulls and\nshowers of spray hid the combat from the observer’s eye. When the birds\nscattered, the ospray had vanished, and the waters again glittered\ncalmly in the morning sun. Truls stood long, vacantly staring out upon\nthe scene of the conflict, and many strange thoughts whirled through his\nhead.\n\n“Halloo, fiddler!” cried a couple of lads who had come to clear the\nwedding boats, “you are early on foot to-day. Here is a scoop. Come on\nand help us bail the boats.”\n\nTruls took the scoop, and looked at it as if he had never seen such a\nthing before; he moved about heavily, hardly knowing what he did, but\nconscious all the while of his own great misery. His limbs seemed half\nfrozen, and a dull pain gathered about his head and in his breast--in\nfact, everywhere and nowhere.\n\nAbout ten o’clock the bridal procession descended the slope to the\nfjord. Syvert Stein, the bridegroom, trod the earth with a firm, springy\nstep, and spoke many a cheery word to the bride, who walked, silent and\nwith downcast eyes, at his side. She wore the ancestral bridal crown on\nher head, and the little silver disks around its edge tinkled and shook\nas she walked. They hailed her with firing of guns and loud hurrahs\nas she stepped into the boat; still she did not raise her eyes, but\nremained silent. A small cannon, also an heir-loom in the family, was\nplaced amidships, and Truls, with his violin, took his seat in the prow.\nA large solitary cloud, gold-rimmed but with thunder in its breast,\nsailed across the sky and threw its shadow over the bridal boat as it\nwas pushed out from the shore, and the shadow fell upon the bride’s\ncountenance too; and when she lifted it, the mother of the bridegroom,\nwho sat opposite her, shrank back, for the countenance looked hard, as\nif carved in stone--in the eyes a mute, hopeless appeal; on the lips a\nfrozen prayer. The shadow of thunder upon a life that was opening--it\nwas an ill omen, and its gloom sank into the hearts of the wedding\nguests. They spoke in undertones and threw pitying glances at the bride.\nThen at length Syvert Stein lost his patience.\n\n“In sooth,” cried he, springing up from his seat, “where is to-day the\ncheer that is wont to abide in the Norseman’s breast? Methinks I see but\nsullen airs and ill-boding glances. Ha, fiddler, now move your strings\nlustily! None of your funeral airs, my lad, but a merry tune that shall\nsing through marrow and bone, and make the heart leap in the bosom.”\n\nTruls heard the words, and in a slow, mechanical way he took the violin\nout of its case and raised it to his chin. Syvert in the mean while put\na huge silver beer-jug to his mouth, and, pledging his guests, emptied\nit even to the dregs. But the bride’s cheek was pale; and it was so\nstill in the boat that every man could hear his own breathing.\n\n“Ha, to-day is Syvert Stein’s wedding-day!” shouted the bridegroom,\ngrowing hot with wrath. “Let us try if the iron voice of the cannon can\nwake my guests from their slumber.”\n\nHe struck a match and put it to the touch-hole of the cannon; a long\nboom rolled away over the surface of the waters and startled the echoes\nof the distant glaciers. A faint hurrah sounded from the nearest craft,\nbut there came no response from the bridal boat. Syvert pulled the\npowder-horn from his pocket, laughed a wild laugh, and poured the whole\ncontents of the horn into the mouth of the cannon.\n\n“Now may the devil care for his own,” roared he, and sprang up upon the\nrow-bench. Then there came a low murmuring strain as of wavelets that\nripple against a sandy shore. Borghild lifted her eyes, and they met\nthose of the fiddler.\n\n“Ah, I think I should rather be your bridegroom,” whispered she, and a\nray of life stole into her stony visage.\n\nAnd she saw herself as a little rosy-cheeked girl sitting at his side\non the beach fifteen years ago. But the music gathered strength from\nher glance, and onward it rushed through the noisy years of boyhood,\nshouting with wanton voice in the lonely glen, lowing with the cattle\non the mountain pastures, and leaping like the trout at eventide in the\nbrawling rapids; but through it all there ran a warm strain of boyish\nloyalty and strong devotion, and it thawed her frozen heart; for she\nknew that it was all for her and for her only. And it seemed such a\nbeautiful thing, this long faithful life, which through sorrow and joy,\nthrough sunshine and gloom, for better for worse, had clung so fast to\nher. The wedding guests raised their heads, and a murmur of applause ran\nover the waters.\n\n“Bravo!” cried the bridegroom. “Now at last the tongues are loosed.”\n\nTruls’s gaze dwelt with tender sadness on the bride. Then came from the\nstrings some airy quivering chords, faintly flushed like the petals of\nthe rose, and fragrant like lilies of the valley; and they swelled with\na strong, awakening life, and rose with a stormy fullness until they\nseemed on the point of bursting, when again they hushed themselves and\nsank into a low, disconsolate whisper. Once more the tones stretched\nout their arms imploringly, and again they wrestled despairingly with\nthemselves, fled with a stern voice of warning, returned once more,\nwept, shuddered, and were silent.\n\n“Beware that thou dost not play with a life!” sighed the bride, “even\nthough it be a worthless one.”\n\nThe wedding guests clapped their hands and shouted wildly against the\nsky. The bride’s countenance burned with a strange feverish glow. The\nfiddler arose in the prow of the boat, his eyes flamed, he struck the\nstrings madly, and the air trembled with melodious rapture. The voice\nof that music no living tongue can interpret. But the bride fathomed its\nmeaning; her bosom labored vehemently, her lips quivered for an instant\nconvulsively, and she burst into tears. A dark suspicion shot through\nthe bridegroom’s mind. He stared intently upon the weeping Borghild then\nturned his gaze to the fiddler, who, still regarding her, stood playing,\nwith a half-frenzied look and motion.\n\n“You cursed wretch!” shrieked Syvert, and made a leap over two benches\nto where Truls was standing. It came so unexpectedly that Truls had\nno time to prepare for defense; so he merely stretched out the hand in\nwhich he held the violin to ward off the blow which he saw was coming;\nbut Syvert tore the instrument from his grasp and dashed it against\nthe cannon, and, as it happened, just against the touch-hole. With a\ntremendous crash something black darted through the air and a white\nsmoke brooded over the bridal boat. The bridegroom stood pale and\nstunned. At his feet lay Borghild--lay for a moment still, as if\nlifeless, then rose on her elbows, and a dark red current broke from her\nbreast. The smoke scattered. No one saw how it was done; but a moment\nlater Truls, the Nameless, lay kneeling at Borghild’s side.\n\n“It WAS a worthless life, beloved,” whispered he, tenderly. “Now it is\nat an end.”\n\nAnd he lifted her up in his arms as one lifts a beloved child, pressed\na kiss on her pale lips, and leaped into the water. Like lead they fell\ninto the sea. A throng of white bubbles whirled up to the surface. A\nloud wail rose from the bridal fleet, and before the day was at an end\nit filled the valley; but the wail did not recall Truls, the Nameless,\nor Borghild his bride.\n\nWhat life denied them, would to God that death may yield them!\n\n\n\n\nASATHOR’S VENGEANCE.\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nIT was right up under the steel mountain wall where the farm of Kvaerk\nlay. How any man of common sense could have hit upon the idea of\nbuilding a house there, where none but the goat and the hawk had easy\naccess, had been, and I am afraid would ever be, a matter of wonder to\nthe parish people. However, it was not Lage Kvaerk who had built\nthe house, so he could hardly be made responsible for its situation.\nMoreover, to move from a place where one’s life has once struck deep\nroot, even if it be in the chinks and crevices of stones and rocks, is\nabout the same as to destroy it. An old tree grows but poorly in a new\nsoil. So Lage Kvaerk thought, and so he said, too, whenever his wife\nElsie spoke of her sunny home at the river.\n\nGloomy as Lage usually was, he had his brighter moments, and people\nnoticed that these were most likely to occur when Aasa, his daughter,\nwas near. Lage was probably also the only being whom Aasa’s presence\ncould cheer; on other people it seemed to have the very opposite effect;\nfor Aasa was--according to the testimony of those who knew her--the most\npeculiar creature that ever was born. But perhaps no one did know her;\nif her father was right, no one really did--at least no one but himself.\n\nAasa was all to her father; she was his past and she was his future, his\nhope and his life; and withal it must be admitted that those who judged\nher without knowing her had at least in one respect as just an opinion\nof her as he; for there was no denying that she was strange, very\nstrange. She spoke when she ought to be silent, and was silent when it\nwas proper to speak; wept when she ought to laugh, and laughed when it\nwas proper to weep; but her laughter as well as her tears, her speech\nlike her silence, seemed to have their source from within her own soul,\nto be occasioned, as it were, by something which no one else could see\nor hear. It made little difference where she was; if the tears came, she\nyielded to them as if they were something she had long desired in vain.\nFew could weep like her, and “weep like Aasa Kvaerk,” was soon also\nadded to the stock of parish proverbs. And then her laugh! Tears may\nbe inopportune enough, when they come out of time, but laughter is far\nworse; and when poor Aasa once burst out into a ringing laughter in\nchurch, and that while the minister was pronouncing the benediction, it\nwas only with the greatest difficulty that her father could prevent\nthe indignant congregation from seizing her and carrying her before the\nsheriff for violation of the church-peace. Had she been poor and homely,\nthen of course nothing could have saved her; but she happened to be both\nrich and beautiful, and to wealth and beauty much is pardoned. Aasa’s\nbeauty, however, was also of a very unusual kind; not the tame sweetness\nso common in her sex, but something of the beauty of the falcon, when it\nswoops down upon the unwatchful sparrow or soars round the lonely\ncrags; something of the mystic depth of the dark tarn, when with bodeful\ntrembling you gaze down into it, and see its weird traditions rise from\nits depth and hover over the pine-tops in the morning fog. Yet, Aasa was\nnot dark; her hair was as fair and yellow as a wheat-field in August,\nher forehead high and clear, and her mouth and chin as if cut with a\nchisel; only her eyes were perhaps somewhat deeper than is common in the\nNorth, and the longer you looked at them the deeper they grew, just like\nthe tarn, which, if you stare long enough into it, you will find is as\ndeep as the heavens above, that is, whose depth only faith and fancy can\nfathom. But however long you looked at Aasa, you could never be quite\nsure that she looked at you; she seemed but to half notice whatever went\non around her; the look of her eye was always more than half inward,\nand when it shone the brightest, it might well happen that she could not\nhave told you how many years she had lived, or the name her father gave\nher in baptism.\n\nNow Aasa was eighteen years old, and could knit, weave, and spin, and it\nwas full time that wooers should come. “But that is the consequence of\nliving in such an out-of-the-way place,” said her mother; “who will risk\nhis limbs to climb that neck-breaking rock? and the round-about way over\nthe forest is rather too long for a wooer.” Besides handling the loom\nand the spinning-wheel, Aasa had also learned to churn and make cheese\nto perfection, and whenever Elsie grieved at her strange behavior she\nalways in the end consoled herself with the reflection that after all\nAasa would make the man who should get her an excellent housewife.\n\nThe farm of Kvaerk was indeed most singularly situated. About a hundred\nfeet from the house the rough wall of the mountain rose steep and\nthreatening; and the most remarkable part of it was that the rock itself\ncaved inward and formed a lofty arch overhead, which looked like a huge\ndoor leading into the mountain. Some short distance below, the slope of\nthe fields ended in an abrupt precipice; far underneath lay the other\nfarm-houses of the valley, scattered like small red or gray dots, and\nthe river wound onward like a white silver stripe in the shelter of the\ndusky forest. There was a path down along the rock, which a goat or a\nbrisk lad might be induced to climb, if the prize of the experiment were\ngreat enough to justify the hazard. The common road to Kvaerk made a\nlarge circuit around the forest, and reached the valley far up at its\nnorthern end.\n\nIt was difficult to get anything to grow at Kvaerk. In the spring all\nthe valley lay bare and green, before the snow had begun to think of\nmelting up there; and the night-frost would be sure to make a visit\nthere, while the fields along the river lay silently drinking the summer\ndew. On such occasions the whole family at Kvaerk would have to stay\nup during all the night and walk back and forth on either side of the\nwheat-fields, carrying a long rope between them and dragging it slowly\nover the heads of the rye, to prevent the frost from settling; for as\nlong as the ears could be kept in motion, they could not freeze. But\nwhat did thrive at Kvaerk in spite of both snow and night-frost was\nlegends, and they throve perhaps the better for the very sterility of\nits material soil. Aasa of course had heard them all and knew them\nby heart; they had been her friends from childhood, and her only\ncompanions. All the servants, however, also knew them and many others\nbesides, and if they were asked how the mansion of Kvaerk happened to be\nbuilt like an eagle’s nest on the brink of a precipice, they would tell\nyou the following:\n\nSaint Olaf, Norway’s holy king, in the time of his youth had sailed as\na Viking over the wide ocean, and in foreign lands had learned the\ndoctrine of Christ the White. When he came home to claim the throne of\nhis hereditary kingdom, he brought with him tapers and black priests,\nand commanded the people to overthrow the altars of Odin and Thor and\nto believe alone in Christ the White. If any still dared to slaughter\na horse to the old gods, he cut off their ears, burned their farms,\nand drove them houseless from the smoking ruins. Here in the valley old\nThor, or, as they called him, Asathor, had always helped us to vengeance\nand victory, and gentle Frey for many years had given us fair and\nfertile summers. Therefore the peasants paid little heed to King Olaf’s\ngod, and continued to bring their offerings to Odin and Asathor. This\nreached the king’s ear, and he summoned his bishop and five black\npriests, and set out to visit our valley. Having arrived here, he called\nthe peasants together, stood up on the Ting-stone, told them of the\ngreat things that the White Christ had done, and bade them choose\nbetween him and the old gods. Some were scared, and received baptism\nfrom the king’s priests; others bit their lips and were silent; others\nagain stood forth and told Saint Olaf that Odin and Asathor had always\nserved them well, and that they were not going to give them up for\nChrist the White, whom they had never seen and of whom they knew\nnothing. The next night the red cock crew [9] over ten farms in the\nvalley, and it happened to be theirs who had spoken against King Olaf’s\ngod. Then the peasants flocked to the Ting-stone and received the\nbaptism of Christ the White. Some few, who had mighty kinsmen in the\nNorth, fled and spread the evil tidings. Only one neither fled nor\nwas baptized, and that one was Lage Ulfson Kvaerk, the ancestor of\nthe present Lage. He slew his best steed before Asathor’s altar, and\npromised to give him whatever he should ask, even to his own life, if he\nwould save him from the vengeance of the king. Asathor heard his prayer.\nAs the sun set, a storm sprung up with thick darkness and gloom, the\nearth shook, Asathor drove his chariot over the heavens with deafening\nthunder and swung his hammer right and left, and the crackling lightning\nflew through the air like a hail-storm of fire. Then the peasants\ntrembled, for they knew that Asathor was wroth. Only the king sat calm\nand fearless with his bishop and priests, quaffing the nut-brown mead.\nThe tempest raged until morn. When the sun rose, Saint Olaf called his\nhundred swains, sprang into the saddle and rode down toward the river.\nFew men who saw the angry fire in his eye, and the frown on his royal\nbrow, doubted whither he was bound. But having reached the ford, a\nwondrous sight met his eye. Where on the day before the highway had\nwound itself up the slope toward Lage Kvaerk’s mansion, lay now a wild\nravine; the rock was shattered into a thousand pieces, and a deep gorge,\nas if made by a single stroke of a huge hammer, separated the king from\nhis enemy. Then Saint Olaf made the sign of the cross, and mumbled the\nname of Christ the White; but his hundred swains made the sign of the\nhammer under their cloaks, and thought, Still is Asathor alive.\n\nThat same night Lage Ulfson Kvaerk slew a black ram, and thanked Asathor\nfor his deliverance; and the Saga tells that while he was sprinkling\nthe blood on the altar, the thundering god himself appeared to him,\nand wilder he looked than the fiercest wild Turk. Rams, said he, were\nevery-day fare; they could redeem no promise. Brynhild, his daughter,\nwas the reward Asathor demanded. Lage prayed and besought him to ask\nfor something else. He would gladly give him one of his sons; for he had\nthree sons, but only one daughter. Asathor was immovable; but so long\nLage continued to beg, that at last he consented to come back in a\nyear, when Lage perchance would be better reconciled to the thought of\nBrynhild’s loss.\n\nIn the mean time King Olaf built a church to Christ the White on the\nheadland at the river, where it stands until this day. Every evening,\nwhen the huge bell rumbled between the mountains, the parishioners\nthought they heard heavy, half-choked sighs over in the rocks at Kvaerk;\nand on Sunday mornings, when the clear-voiced chimes called them to\nhigh-mass, a suppressed moan would mingle with the sound of the bells,\nand die away with the last echo. Lage Ulfson was not the man to be\nafraid; yet the church-bells many a time drove the blood from his\ncheeks; for he also heard the moan from the mountain.\n\nThe year went, and Asathor returned. If he had not told his name,\nhowever, Lage would not have recognized him. That a year could work so\ngreat a change in a god, he would hardly have believed, if his own eyes\nhad not testified to it. Asathor’s cheeks were pale and bloodless, the\nlustre of his eye more than half quenched, and his gray hair hung in\ndisorder down over his forehead.\n\n“Methinks thou lookest rather poorly to-day,” said Lage.\n\n“It is only those cursed church-bells,” answered the god; “they leave me\nno rest day or night.”\n\n“Aha,” thought Lage, “if the king’s bells are mightier than thou, then\nthere is still hope of safety for my daughter.”\n\n“Where is Brynhild, thy daughter?” asked Asathor.\n\n“I know not where she is,” answered the father; and straightway he\nturned his eyes toward the golden cross that shone over the valley from\nSaint Olaf’s steeple, and he called aloud on the White Christ’s name.\nThen the god gave a fearful roar, fell on the ground, writhed and foamed\nand vanished into the mountain. In the next moment Lage heard a hoarse\nvoice crying from within, “I shall return, Lage Ulfson, when thou shalt\nleast expect me!”\n\nLage Ulfson then set to work clearing a way through the forest; and when\nthat was done, he called all his household together, and told them of\nthe power of Christ the White. Not long after he took his sons and his\ndaughter, and hastened with them southward, until he found King Olaf.\nAnd, so the Saga relates, they all fell down on their knees before him,\nprayed for his forgiveness, and received baptism from the king’s own\nbishop.\n\nSo ends the Saga of Lage Ulfson Kvaerk.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAasa Kvaerk loved her father well, but especially in the winter. Then,\nwhile she sat turning her spinning-wheel in the light of the crackling\nlogs, his silent presence always had a wonderfully soothing and calming\neffect upon her. She never laughed then, and seldom wept; when she felt\nhis eyes resting on her, her thoughts, her senses, and her whole being\nseemed by degrees to be lured from their hiding-place and concentrate on\nhim; and from him they ventured again, first timidly, then more boldly,\nto grasp the objects around him. At such times Aasa could talk and\njest almost like other girls, and her mother, to whom “other girls”\n represented the ideal of womanly perfection, would send significant\nglances, full of hope and encouragement, over to Lage, and he would\nquietly nod in return, as if to say that he entirely agreed with her.\nThen Elsie had bright visions of wooers and thrifty housewives, and even\nLage dreamed of seeing the ancient honor of the family re-established.\nAll depended on Aasa. She was the last of the mighty race. But when\nsummer came, the bright visions fled; and the spring winds, which to\nothers bring life and joy, to Kvaerk brought nothing but sorrow. No\nsooner had the mountain brooks begun to swell, than Aasa began to laugh\nand to weep; and when the first birches budded up in the glens, she\ncould no longer be kept at home. Prayers and threats were equally\nuseless. From early dawn until evening she would roam about in forests\nand fields, and when late at night she stole into the room and slipped\naway into some corner, Lage drew a deep sigh and thought of the old\ntradition.\n\nAasa was nineteen years old before she had a single wooer. But when she\nwas least expecting it, the wooer came to her.\n\nIt was late one summer night; the young maiden was sitting on the brink\nof the ravine, pondering on the old legend and peering down into the\ndeep below. It was not the first time she had found her way hither,\nwhere but seldom a human foot had dared to tread. To her every alder and\nbramble-bush, that clothed the naked wall of the rock, were as familiar\nas were the knots and veins in the ceiling of the chamber where from\nher childhood she had slept; and as she sat there on the brink of the\nprecipice, the late summer sun threw its red lustre upon her and upon\nthe fogs that came drifting up from the deep. With her eyes she followed\nthe drifting masses of fog, and wondered, as they rose higher and\nhigher, when they would reach her; in her fancy she saw herself dancing\nover the wide expanse of heaven, clad in the sun-gilded evening fogs;\nand Saint Olaf, the great and holy king, came riding to meet her,\nmounted on a flaming steed made of the glory of a thousand sunsets; then\nSaint Olaf took her hand and lifted her up, and she sat with him on the\nflaming steed: but the fog lingered in the deep below, and as it rose\nit spread like a thin, half-invisible gauze over the forests and the\nfields, and at last vanished into the infinite space. But hark! a huge\nstone rolls down over the mountain-side, then another, and another; the\nnoise grows, the birches down there in the gorge tremble and shake.\nAasa leaned out over the brink of the ravine, and, as far as she could\ndistinguish anything from her dizzying height, thought she saw something\ngray creeping slowly up the neck-breaking mountain path; she watched\nit for a while, but as it seemed to advance no farther she again took\nrefuge in her reveries. An hour might have passed, or perhaps more, when\nsuddenly she heard a noise only a few feet distant, and, again stooping\nout over the brink, saw the figure of a man struggling desperately to\nclimb the last great ledge of the rock. With both his hands he clung to\na little birch-tree which stretched its slender arms down over the black\nwall, but with every moment that passed seemed less likely to accomplish\nthe feat. The girl for a while stood watching him with unfeigned\ncuriosity, then, suddenly reminding herself that the situation to him\nmust be a dangerous one, seized hold of a tree that grew near the brink,\nand leaned out over the rock to give him her assistance. He eagerly\ngrasped her extended hand, and with a vigorous pull she flung him up\non the grassy level, where he remained lying for a minute or two,\napparently utterly unable to account for his sudden ascent, and gazing\naround him with a half-frightened, half-bewildered look. Aasa, to whom\nhis appearance was no less strange than his demeanor, unluckily hit\nupon the idea that perhaps her rather violent treatment had momentarily\nstunned him, and when, as answer to her sympathizing question if he was\nhurt, the stranger abruptly rose to his feet and towered up before her\nto the formidable height of six feet four or five, she could no longer\nmaster her mirth, but burst out into a most vehement fit of laughter.\nHe stood calm and silent, and looked at her with a timid but strangely\nbitter smile. He was so very different from any man she had ever seen\nbefore; therefore she laughed, not necessarily because he amused her,\nbut because his whole person was a surprise to her; and there he stood,\ntall and gaunt and timid, and said not a word, only gazed and gazed. His\ndress was not the national costume of the valley, neither was it like\nanything that Aasa had ever known. On his head he wore a cap that hung\nall on one side, and was decorated with a long, heavy silk tassel. A\nthreadbare coat, which seemed to be made expressly not to fit him, hung\nloosely on his sloping shoulders, and a pair of gray pantaloons, which\nwere narrow where they ought to have been wide, and wide where it was\ntheir duty to be narrow, extended their service to a little more than\nthe upper half of the limb, and, by a kind of compromise with the tops\nof the boots, managed to protect also the lower half. His features were\ndelicate, and would have been called handsome had they belonged to a\nproportionately delicate body; in his eyes hovered a dreamy vagueness\nwhich seemed to come and vanish, and to flit from one feature to\nanother, suggesting the idea of remoteness, and a feeling of hopeless\nstrangeness to the world and all its concerns.\n\n“Do I inconvenience you, madam?” were the first words he uttered, as\nAasa in her usual abrupt manner stayed her laughter, turned her back on\nhim, and hastily started for the house.\n\n“Inconvenience?” said she, surprised, and again slowly turned on her\nheel; “no, not that I know.”\n\n“Then tell me if there are people living here in the neighborhood, or if\nthe light deceived me, which I saw from the other side of the river.”\n\n“Follow me,” answered Aasa, and she naïvely reached him her hand; “my\nfather’s name is Lage Ulfson Kvaerk; he lives in the large house you see\nstraight before you, there on the hill; and my mother lives there too.”\n\nAnd hand in hand they walked together, where a path had been made\nbetween two adjoining rye-fields; his serious smile seemed to grow\nmilder and happier, the longer he lingered at her side, and her eye\ncaught a ray of more human intelligence, as it rested on him.\n\n“What do you do up here in the long winter?” asked he, after a pause.\n\n“We sing,” answered she, as it were at random, because the word came\ninto her mind; “and what do you do, where you come from?”\n\n“I gather song.”\n\n“Have you ever heard the forest sing?” asked she, curiously.\n\n“That is why I came here.”\n\nAnd again they walked on in silence.\n\nIt was near midnight when they entered the large hall at Kvaerk. Aasa\nwent before, still leading the young man by the hand. In the twilight\nwhich filled the house, the space between the black, smoky rafters\nopened a vague vista into the region of the fabulous, and every object\nin the room loomed forth from the dusk with exaggerated form and\ndimensions. The room appeared at first to be but the haunt of the\nspirits of the past; no human voice, no human footstep, was heard; and\nthe stranger instinctively pressed the hand he held more tightly; for he\nwas not sure but that he was standing on the boundary of dream-land,\nand some elfin maiden had reached him her hand to lure him into her\nmountain, where he should live with her forever. But the illusion was of\nbrief duration; for Aasa’s thoughts had taken a widely different course;\nit was but seldom she had found herself under the necessity of making a\ndecision; and now it evidently devolved upon her to find the stranger\na place of rest for the night; so instead of an elf-maid’s kiss and a\nsilver palace, he soon found himself huddled into a dark little alcove\nin the wall, where he was told to go to sleep, while Aasa wandered over\nto the empty cow-stables, and threw herself down in the hay by the side\nof two sleeping milkmaids.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThere was not a little astonishment manifested among the servant-maids\nat Kvaerk the next morning, when the huge, gaunt figure of a man was\nseen to launch forth from Aasa’s alcove, and the strangest of all was,\nthat Aasa herself appeared to be as much astonished as the rest. And\nthere they stood, all gazing at the bewildered traveler, who indeed was\nno less startled than they, and as utterly unable to account for his\nown sudden apparition. After a long pause, he summoned all his courage,\nfixed his eyes intently on the group of the girls, and with a few rapid\nsteps advanced toward Aasa, whom he seized by the hand and asked, “Are\nyou not my maiden of yester-eve?”\n\nShe met his gaze firmly, and laid her hand on her forehead as if to\nclear her thoughts; as the memory of the night flashed through her mind,\na bright smile lit up her features, and she answered, “You are the man\nwho gathers song. Forgive me, I was not sure but it was all a dream; for\nI dream so much.”\n\nThen one of the maids ran out to call Lage Ulfson, who had gone to the\nstables to harness the horses; and he came and greeted the unknown man,\nand thanked him for last meeting, as is the wont of Norse peasants,\nalthough they had never seen each other until that morning. But when the\nstranger had eaten two meals in Lage’s house, Lage asked him his name\nand his father’s occupation; for old Norwegian hospitality forbids the\nhost to learn the guest’s name before he has slept and eaten under his\nroof. It was that same afternoon, when they sat together smoking their\npipes under the huge old pine in the yard,--it was then Lage inquired\nabout the young man’s name and family; and the young man said that his\nname was Trond Vigfusson, that he had graduated at the University of\nChristiania, and that his father had been a lieutenant in the army; but\nboth he and Trond’s mother had died, when Trond was only a few years\nold. Lage then told his guest Vigfusson something about his family, but\nof the legend of Asathor and Saint Olaf he spoke not a word. And while\nthey were sitting there talking together, Aasa came and sat down at\nVigfusson’s feet; her long golden hair flowed in a waving stream down\nover her back and shoulders, there was a fresh, healthful glow on her\ncheeks, and her blue, fathomless eyes had a strangely joyous, almost\ntriumphant expression. The father’s gaze dwelt fondly upon her, and\nthe collegian was but conscious of one thought: that she was wondrously\nbeautiful. And still so great was his natural timidity and awkwardness\nin the presence of women, that it was only with the greatest difficulty\nhe could master his first impulse to find some excuse for leaving her.\nShe, however, was aware of no such restraint.\n\n“You said you came to gather song,” she said; “where do you find it? for\nI too should like to find some new melody for my old thoughts; I have\nsearched so long.”\n\n“I find my songs on the lips of the people,” answered he, “and I write\nthem down as the maidens or the old men sing them.”\n\nShe did not seem quite to comprehend that. “Do you hear maidens sing\nthem?” asked she, astonished. “Do you mean the troll-virgins and the\nelf-maidens?”\n\n“By troll-virgins and elf-maidens, or what the legends call so, I\nunderstand the hidden and still audible voices of nature, of the dark\npine forests, the legend-haunted glades, and the silent tarns; and this\nwas what I referred to when I answered your question if I had ever heard\nthe forest sing.”\n\n“Oh, oh!” cried she, delighted, and clapped her hands like a child;\nbut in another moment she as suddenly grew serious again, and sat\nsteadfastly gazing into his eye, as if she were trying to look into his\nvery soul and there to find something kindred to her own lonely heart. A\nminute ago her presence had embarrassed him; now, strange to say, he met\nher eye, and smiled happily as he met it.\n\n“Do you mean to say that you make your living by writing songs?” asked\nLage.\n\n“The trouble is,” answered Vigfusson, “that I make no living at all; but\nI have invested a large capital, which is to yield its interest in the\nfuture. There is a treasure of song hidden in every nook and corner of\nour mountains and forests, and in our nation’s heart. I am one of the\nminers who have come to dig it out before time and oblivion shall\nhave buried every trace of it, and there shall not be even the\nwill-o’-the-wisp of a legend to hover over the spot, and keep alive the\nsad fact of our loss and our blamable negligence.”\n\nHere the young man paused; his eyes gleamed, his pale cheeks flushed,\nand there was a warmth and an enthusiasm in his words which alarmed\nLage, while on Aasa it worked like the most potent charm of the ancient\nmystic runes; she hardly comprehended more than half of the speaker’s\nmeaning, but his fire and eloquence were on this account none the less\npowerful.\n\n“If that is your object,” remarked Lage, “I think you have hit upon the\nright place in coming here. You will be able to pick up many an odd bit\nof a story from the servants and others hereabouts, and you are welcome\nto stay here with us as long as you choose.”\n\nLage could not but attribute to Vigfusson the merit of having kept Aasa\nat home a whole day, and that in the month of midsummer. And while he\nsat there listening to their conversation, while he contemplated the\ndelight that beamed from his daughter’s countenance and, as he thought,\nthe really intelligent expression of her eyes, could he conceal from\nhimself the paternal hopes that swelled his heart? She was all that was\nleft him, the life or the death of his mighty race. And here was one who\nwas likely to understand her, and to whom she seemed willing to yield\nall the affection of her warm but wayward heart. Thus ran Lage Ulfson’s\nreflections; and at night he had a little consultation with Elsie, his\nwife, who, it is needless to add, was no less sanguine than he.\n\n“And then Aasa will make an excellent housewife, you know,” observed\nElsie. “I will speak to the girl about it to-morrow.”\n\n“No, for Heaven’s sake, Elsie!” exclaimed Lage, “don’t you know your\ndaughter better than that? Promise me, Elsie, that you will not say a\nsingle word; it would be a cruel thing, Elsie, to mention anything to\nher. She is not like other girls, you know.”\n\n“Very well, Lage, I shall not say a single word. Alas, you are right,\nshe is not like other girls.” And Elsie again sighed at her husband’s\nsad ignorance of a woman’s nature, and at the still sadder fact of her\ndaughter’s inferiority to the accepted standard of womanhood.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nTrond Vigfusson must have made a rich harvest of legends at Kvaerk, at\nleast judging by the time he stayed there; for days and weeks passed,\nand he had yet said nothing of going. Not that anybody wished him to\ngo; no, on the contrary, the longer he stayed the more indispensable he\nseemed to all; and Lage Ulfson could hardly think without a shudder of\nthe possibility of his ever having to leave them. For Aasa, his only\nchild, was like another being in the presence of this stranger; all that\nweird, forest-like intensity, that wild, half supernatural tinge in her\ncharacter which in a measure excluded her from the blissful feeling of\nfellowship with other men, and made her the strange, lonely creature\nshe was,--all this seemed to vanish as dew in the morning sun when\nVigfusson’s eyes rested upon her; and with every day that passed, her\nhuman and womanly nature gained a stronger hold upon her. She followed\nhim like his shadow on all his wanderings, and when they sat down\ntogether by the wayside, she would sing, in a clear, soft voice, an\nancient lay or ballad, and he would catch her words on his paper, and\nsmile at the happy prospect of perpetuating what otherwise would\nhave been lost. Aasa’s love, whether conscious or not, was to him an\neverlasting source of strength, was a revelation of himself to himself,\nand a clearing and widening power which brought ever more and more of\nthe universe within the scope of his vision. So they lived on from\nday to day and from week to week, and, as old Lage remarked, never had\nKvaerk been the scene of so much happiness. Not a single time during\nVigfusson’s stay had Aasa fled to the forest, not a meal had she missed,\nand at the hours for family devotion she had taken her seat at the big\ntable with the rest and apparently listened with as much attention and\ninterest. Indeed, all this time Aasa seemed purposely to avoid the dark\nhaunts of the woods, and, whenever she could, chose the open highway;\nnot even Vigfusson’s entreaties could induce her to tread the tempting\npaths that led into the forest’s gloom.\n\n“And why not, Aasa?” he would say; “summer is ten times summer there\nwhen the drowsy noonday spreads its trembling maze of shadows between\nthose huge, venerable trunks. You can feel the summer creeping into your\nvery heart and soul, there!”\n\n“Oh, Vigfusson,” she would answer, shaking her head mournfully, “for a\nhundred paths that lead in, there is only one that leads out again, and\nsometimes even that one is nowhere to be found.”\n\nHe understood her not, but fearing to ask, he remained silent.\n\nHis words and his eyes always drew her nearer and nearer to him; and the\nforest and its strange voices seemed a dark, opposing influence, which\nstrove to take possession of her heart and to wrest her away from him\nforever; she helplessly clung to him; every thought and emotion of\nher soul clustered about him, and every hope of life and happiness was\nstaked on him.\n\nOne evening Vigfusson and old Lage Ulfson had been walking about the\nfields to look at the crop, both smoking their evening pipes. But as\nthey came down toward the brink whence the path leads between the two\nadjoining rye-fields, they heard a sweet, sad voice crooning some old\nditty down between the birch-trees at the precipice; they stopped to\nlisten, and soon recognized Aasa’s yellow hair over the tops the\nrye; the shadow as of a painful emotion flitted over the father’s\ncountenance, and he turned his back on his guest and started to go; then\nagain paused, and said, imploringly, “Try to get her home if you can,\nfriend Vigfusson.”\n\nVigfusson nodded, and Lage went; the song had ceased for a moment, now\nit began again:\n\n  “Ye twittering birdlings, in forest and glen\n    I have heard you so gladly before;\n    But a bold knight hath come to woo me,\n    I dare listen to you no more.\n  For it is so dark, so dark in the forest.\n\n   “And the knight who hath come a-wooing to me,\n    He calls me his love and his own;\n    Why then should I stray through the darksome woods,\n    Or dream in the glades alone?\n  For it is so dark, so dark in the forest.”\n\n\nHer voice fell to a low unintelligible murmur; then it rose, and the\nlast verses came, clear, soft, and low, drifting on the evening breeze:\n\n   “Yon beckoning world, that shimmering lay\n     O’er the woods where the old pines grow,\n     That gleamed through the moods of the summer day\n     When the breezes were murmuring low\n  (And it is so dark, so dark in the forest);\n\n   “Oh let me no more in the sunshine hear\n     Its quivering noonday call;\n     The bold knight’s love is the sun of my heart--\n     Is my life, and my all in all.\n  But it is so dark, so dark in the forest.”\n\n\nThe young man felt the blood rushing to his face--his heart beat\nviolently. There was a keen sense of guilt in the blush on his cheek, a\nloud accusation in the throbbing pulse and the swelling heart-beat. Had\nhe not stood there behind the maiden’s back and cunningly peered into\nher soul’s holy of holies? True, he loved Aasa; at least he thought he\ndid, and the conviction was growing stronger with every day that passed.\nAnd now he had no doubt that he had gained her heart. It was not so much\nthe words of the ballad which had betrayed the secret; he hardly knew\nwhat it was, but somehow the truth had flashed upon him, and he could no\nlonger doubt.\n\nVigfusson sat down on the moss-grown rock and pondered. How long he\nsat there he did not know, but when he rose and looked around, Aasa\nwas gone. Then remembering her father’s request to bring her home, he\nhastened up the hill-side toward the mansion, and searched for her in\nall directions. It was near midnight when he returned to Kvaerk, where\nAasa sat in her high gable window, still humming the weird melody of the\nold ballad.\n\nBy what reasoning Vigfusson arrived at his final conclusion is difficult\nto tell. If he had acted according to his first and perhaps most\ngenerous impulse, the matter would soon have been decided; but he was\nall the time possessed of a vague fear of acting dishonorably, and it\nwas probably this very fear which made him do what, to the minds of\nthose whose friendship and hospitality he had accepted, had something\nof the appearance he wished so carefully to avoid. Aasa was rich; he had\nnothing; it was a reason for delay, but hardly a conclusive one. They\ndid not know him; he must go out in the world and prove himself worthy\nof her. He would come back when he should have compelled the world to\nrespect him; for as yet he had done nothing. In fact, his arguments were\ngood and honorable enough, and there would have been no fault to find\nwith him, had the object of his love been as capable of reasoning as he\nwas himself. But Aasa, poor thing, could do nothing by halves; a nature\nlike hers brooks no delay; to her love was life or it was death.\n\nThe next morning he appeared at breakfast with his knapsack on his back,\nand otherwise equipped for his journey. It was of no use that Elsie\ncried and begged him to stay, that Lage joined his prayers to hers, and\nthat Aasa stood staring at him with a bewildered gaze. Vigfusson\nshook hands with them all, thanked them for their kindness to him,\nand promised to return; he held Aasa’s hand long in his, but when he\nreleased it, it dropped helplessly at her side.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nFar up in the glen, about a mile from Kvaerk, ran a little brook; that\nis, it was little in summer and winter, but in the spring, while the\nsnow was melting up in the mountains, it overflowed the nearest land\nand turned the whole glen into a broad and shallow river. It was easy to\ncross, however; a light foot might jump from stone to stone, and be over\nin a minute. Not the hind herself could be lighter on her foot than Aasa\nwas; and even in the spring-flood it was her wont to cross and recross\nthe brook, and to sit dreaming on a large stone against which the water\nbroke incessantly, rushing in white torrents over its edges.\n\nHere she sat one fair summer day--the day after Vigfusson’s departure.\nIt was noon, and the sun stood high over the forest. The water murmured\nand murmured, babbled and whispered, until at length there came a sudden\nunceasing tone into its murmur, then another, and it sounded like a\nfaint whispering song of small airy beings. And as she tried to listen,\nto fix the air in her mind, it all ceased again, and she heard but\nthe monotonous murmuring of the brook. Everything seemed so empty and\nworthless, as if that faint melody had been the world of the moment. But\nthere it was again; it sung and sung, and the birch overhead took up the\nmelody and rustled it with its leaves, and the grasshopper over in the\ngrass caught it and whirred it with her wings. The water, the trees, the\nair, were full of it. What a strange melody!\n\nAasa well knew that every brook and river has its Neck, besides hosts\nof little water-sprites. She had heard also that in the moonlight at\nmidsummer, one might chance to see them rocking in bright little\nshells, playing among the pebbles, or dancing on the large leaves of the\nwater-lily. And that they could sing also, she doubted not; it was their\nvoices she heard through the murmuring of the brook. Aasa eagerly bent\nforward and gazed down into the water: the faint song grew louder,\npaused suddenly, and sprang into life again; and its sound was so sweet,\nso wonderfully alluring! Down there in the water, where a stubborn\npebble kept chafing a precipitous little side current, clear tiny\npearl-drops would leap up from the stream, and float half-wonderingly\ndownward from rapid to rapid, until they lost themselves in the whirl\nof some stronger current. Thus sat Aasa and gazed and gazed, and in one\nmoment she seemed to see what in the next moment she saw not. Then a\nsudden great hush stole through the forest, and in the hush she could\nhear the silence calling her name. It was so long since she had been in\nthe forest, it seemed ages and ages ago. She hardly knew herself; the\nlight seemed to be shining into her eyes as with a will and purpose,\nperhaps to obliterate something, some old dream or memory, or to impart\nsome new power--the power of seeing the unseen. And this very thought,\nthis fear of some possible loss, brought the fading memory back, and she\npressed her hands against her throbbing temples as if to bind and chain\nit there forever; and it was he to whom her thought returned. She heard\nhis voice, saw him beckoning to her to follow him, and she rose to obey,\nbut her limbs were as petrified, and the stone on which she was sitting\nheld her with the power of a hundred strong arms. The sunshine smote\nupon her eyelids, and his name was blotted out from her life; there was\nnothing but emptiness all around her. Gradually the forest drew nearer\nand nearer, the water bubbled and rippled, and the huge, bare-stemmed\npines stretched their long gnarled arms toward her. The birches waved\ntheir heads with a wistful nod, and the profile of the rock grew into a\nface with a long, hooked nose, and a mouth half open as if to speak.\nAnd the word that trembled on his lips was, “Come.” She felt no fear nor\nreluctance, but rose to obey. Then and not until then she saw an old man\nstanding at her side; his face was the face of the rock, his white beard\nflowed to his girdle, and his mouth was half open, but no word came from\nhis lips. There was something in the wistful look of his eye which she\nknew so well, which she had seen so often, although she could not\ntell when or where. The old man extended his hand; Aasa took it, and\nfearlessly or rather spontaneously followed. They approached the steep,\nrocky wall; as they drew near, a wild, fierce laugh rang through the\nforest. The features of the old man were twisted as it were into a grin;\nso also were the features of the rock; but the laugh blew like a mighty\nblast through the forest.\n\nAasa clung to the old man’s hand and followed him--she knew not whither.\n\nAt home in the large sitting-room at Kvaerk sat Lage, brooding over the\nwreck of his hopes and his happiness. Aasa had gone to the woods again\nthe very first day after Vigfusson’s departure. What would be the end of\nall this? It was already late in the evening, and she had not returned.\nThe father cast anxious glances toward the door, every time he heard the\nlatch moving. At last, when it was near midnight, he roused all his\nmen from their sleep, and commanded them to follow him. Soon the dusky\nforests resounded far and near with the blast of horns, the report of\nguns, and the calling and shouting of men. The affrighted stag crossed\nand recrossed the path of the hunters, but not a rifle was leveled at\nits head. Toward morning--it was before the sun had yet risen--Lage,\nweary and stunned, stood leaning up against a huge fir. Then suddenly a\nfierce, wild laugh rang through the forest. Lage shuddered, raised his\nhand slowly and pressed it hard against his forehead, vainly struggling\nto clear his thoughts. The men clung fearfully together; a few of the\nmore courageous ones drew their knives and made the sign of the cross\nwith them in the air. Again the same mad laugh shook the air, and swept\nover the crowns of the pine-trees. Then Lage lifted his eyes toward\nheaven and wrung his hands: for the awful truth stood before him. He\nremained a long while leaning against that old fir as in a dead stupor;\nand no one dared to arouse him. A suppressed murmur reached the men’s\nears. “But deliver us from evil” were the last words they heard.\n\nWhen Lage and his servants came home to Kvaerk with the mournful tidings\nof Aasa’s disappearance, no one knew what to do or say. There could be\nno doubt that Aasa was “mountain-taken,” as they call it; for there were\nTrolds and dwarfs in all the rocks and forests round about, and they\nwould hardly let slip the chance of alluring so fair a maiden as Aasa\nwas into their castles in the mountains. Elsie, her mother, knew a good\ndeal about the Trolds, their tricks, and their way of living, and\nwhen she had wept her fill, she fell to thinking of the possibility of\nregaining her daughter from their power. If Aasa had not yet tasted of\nfood or drink in the mountain, she was still out of danger; and if the\npastor would allow the church-bell to be brought up into the forest and\nrung near the rock where the laugh had been heard, the Trolds could be\ncompelled to give her back. No sooner had this been suggested to Lage,\nthan the command was given to muster the whole force of men and horses,\nand before evening on the same day the sturdy swains of Kvaerk were seen\nclimbing the tower of the venerable church, whence soon the huge old\nbell descended, to the astonishment of the throng of curious women and\nchildren who had flocked together to see the extraordinary sight. It was\nlaid upon four large wagons, which had been joined together with ropes\nand planks, and drawn away by twelve strong horses. Long after the\nstrange caravan had vanished in the twilight, the children stood gazing\nup into the empty bell-tower.\n\nIt was near midnight, when Lage stood at the steep, rocky wall in the\nforest; the men were laboring to hoist the church-bell up to a staunch\ncross-beam between two mighty fir-trees, and in the weird light of their\ntorches, the wild surroundings looked wilder and more fantastic. Anon,\nthe muffled noise and bustle of the work being at an end, the laborers\nwithdrew, and a strange, feverish silence seemed to brood over the\nforest. Lage took a step forward, and seized the bell-rope; the clear,\nconquering toll of the metal rung solemnly through the silence, and from\nthe rocks, the earth, and the tree-tops, rose a fierce chorus of howls,\ngroans, and screams. All night the ringing continued; the old trees\nswayed to and fro, creaked, and groaned, the roots loosened their holds\nin the fissures of the rock, and the bushy crowns bowed low under their\nunwonted burden.\n\nIt was well-nigh morn, but the dense fog still brooded over the woods,\nand it was dark as night. Lage was sitting on the ground, his head\nleaning on both his elbows; at his side lay the flickering torch, and\nthe huge bell hung dumb overhead. In the dark he felt a hand touch\nhis shoulder; had it happened only a few hours before, he would have\nshuddered; now the physical sensation hardly communicated itself to his\nmind, or, if it did, had no power to rouse him from his dead, hopeless\napathy. Suddenly--could he trust his own ears?--the church-bell gave a\nslow, solemn, quivering stroke, and the fogs rolled in thick masses to\nthe east and to the west, as if blown by the breath of the sound. Lage\nseized his torch, sprang to his feet, and saw--Vigfusson. He stretched\nhis arm with the blazing torch closer to the young man’s face, stared\nat him with large eyes, and his lip quivered; but he could not utter a\nword.\n\n“Vigfusson?” faltered he at last.\n\n“It is I;” and the second stroke followed, stronger and more solemn than\nthe first. The same fierce, angry voices chorused forth from every\nnook of the rock and the woods. Then came the third--the noise grew;\nfourth--and it sounded like a hoarse, angry hiss; when the twelfth\nstroke fell, silence reigned again in the forest. Vigfusson dropped the\nbell-rope, and with a loud voice called Lage Kvaerk and his men. He\nlit a torch, held it aloft over his head, and peered through the dusky\nnight. The men spread through the highlands to search for the lost\nmaiden; Lage followed close in Vigfusson’s footsteps. They had not\nwalked far when they heard the babbling of the brook only a few feet\naway. Thither they directed their steps. On a large stone in the middle\nof the stream the youth thought he saw something white, like a large\nkerchief. Quick as thought he was at its side, bowed down with his\ntorch, and--fell backward. It was Aasa, his beloved, cold and dead;\nbut as the father stooped over his dead child the same mad laugh echoed\nwildly throughout the wide woods, but madder and louder than ever\nbefore, and from the rocky wall came a fierce, broken voice:\n\n“I came at last.”\n\n\nWhen, after an hour of vain search, the men returned to the place whence\nthey had started, they saw a faint light flickering between the birches\nnot fifty feet away; they formed a firm column, and with fearful hearts\ndrew nearer. There lay Lage Kvaerk, their master, still bending down\nover his child’s pale features, and staring into her sunken eyes as if\nhe could not believe that she were really dead. And at his side stood\nVigfusson, pale and aghast, with the burning torch in his hand. The\nfootsteps of the men awakened the father, but when he turned his face on\nthem they shuddered and started back. Then Lage rose, lifted the maiden\nfrom the stone, and silently laid her in Vigfusson’s arms; her rich\nyellow hair flowed down over his shoulder. The youth let his torch\nfall into the waters, and with a sharp, serpent-like hiss its flame\nwas quenched. He crossed the brook; the men followed, and the dark\npine-trees closed over the last descendant of Lage Ulfson’s mighty race.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n[1] “I am a Dane.
