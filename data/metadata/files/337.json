EARLIEST RECOLLECTIONS\n\n\n\n\nI. Hadakah, “The Pitiful Last”\n\nWHAT boy would not be an Indian for a while when he thinks of the freest\nlife in the world? This life was mine. Every day there was a real hunt.\nThere was real game. Occasionally there was a medicine dance away off in\nthe woods where no one could disturb us, in which the boys impersonated\ntheir elders, Brave Bull, Standing Elk, High Hawk, Medicine Bear, and\nthe rest. They painted and imitated their fathers and grandfathers to\nthe minutest detail, and accurately too, because they had seen the real\nthing all their lives.\n\nWe were not only good mimics but we were close students of nature. We\nstudied the habits of animals just as you study your books. We watched\nthe men of our people and represented them in our play; then learned to\nemulate them in our lives.\n\nNo people have a better use of their five senses than the children of\nthe wilderness. We could smell as well as hear and see. We could feel\nand taste as well as we could see and hear. Nowhere has the memory been\nmore fully developed than in the wild life, and I can still see wherein\nI owe much to my early training.\n\n\nOf course I myself do not remember when I first saw the day, but my\nbrothers have often recalled the event with much mirth; for it was a\ncustom of the Sioux that when a boy was born his brother must plunge\ninto the water, or roll in the snow naked if it was winter time; and if\nhe was not big enough to do either of these himself, water was thrown\non him. If the new-born had a sister, she must be immersed. The idea\nwas that a warrior had come to camp, and the other children must display\nsome act of hardihood.\n\nI was so unfortunate as to be the youngest of five children who, soon\nafter I was born, were left motherless. I had to bear the humiliating\nname “Hakadah,” meaning “the pitiful last,” until I should earn a more\ndignified and appropriate name. I was regarded as little more than a\nplaything by the rest of the children.\n\nMy mother, who was known as the handsomest woman of all the Spirit Lake\nand Leaf Dweller Sioux, was dangerously ill, and one of the medicine men\nwho attended her said: “Another medicine man has come into existence,\nbut the mother must die. Therefore let him bear the name ‘Mysterious\nMedicine.’” But one of the bystanders hastily interfered, saying that an\nuncle of the child already bore that name, so, for the time, I was only\n“Hakadah.”\n\nMy beautiful mother, sometimes called the “Demi-Goddess” of the Sioux,\nwho tradition says had every feature of a Caucasian descent with the\nexception of her luxuriant black hair and deep black eyes, held me\ntightly to her bosom upon her death-bed, while she whispered a few words\nto her mother-in-law. She said: “I give you this boy for your own. I\ncannot trust my own mother with him; she will neglect him and he will\nsurely die.”\n\nThe woman to whom these words were spoken was below the average in\nstature, remarkably active for her age (she was then fully sixty), and\npossessed of as much goodness as intelligence. My mother’s judgment\nconcerning her own mother was well founded, for soon after her death\nthat old lady appeared, and declared that Hakadah was too young to live\nwithout a mother. She offered to keep me until I died, and then she\nwould put me in my mother’s grave. Of course my other grandmother\ndenounced the suggestion as a very wicked one, and refused to give me\nup.\n\nThe babe was done up as usual in a movable cradle made from an oak board\ntwo and a half feet long and one and a half feet wide. On one side of\nit was nailed with brass-headed tacks the richly-embroidered sack, which\nwas open in front and laced up and down with buckskin strings. Over\nthe arms of the infant was a wooden bow, the ends of which were firmly\nattached to the board, so that if the cradle should fall the child’s\nhead and face would be protected. On this bow were hung curious\nplaythings--strings of artistically carved bones and hoofs of deer,\nwhich rattled when the little hands moved them.\n\nIn this upright cradle I lived, played and slept the greater part of the\ntime during the first few months of my life. Whether I was made to lean\nagainst a lodge pole or was suspended from a bough of a tree, while\nmy grandmother cut wood, or whether I was carried on her back, or\nconveniently balanced by another child in a similar cradle hung on the\nopposite side of a pony, I was still in my oaken bed.\n\nThis grandmother, who had already lived through sixty years of\nhardships, was a wonder to the young maidens of the tribe. She showed\nno less enthusiasm over Hakadah than she had done when she held her\nfirst-born, the boy’s father, in her arms. Every little attention that\nis due to a loved child she performed with much skill and devotion. She\nmade all my scanty garments and my tiny moccasins with a great deal of\ntaste. It was said by all that I could not have had more attention had\nmy mother been living.\n\nUncheedah (grandmother) was a great singer. Sometimes, when Hakadah\nwakened too early in the morning, she would sing to him something like\nthe following lullaby:\n\n\n    Sleep, sleep, my boy, the Chippewas\n\n      Are far away--are far away.\n\n    Sleep, sleep, my boy; prepare to meet\n\n      The foe by day--the foe by day!\n\n    The cowards will not dare to fight\n\n      Till morning break--till morning break.\n\n    Sleep, sleep, my child, while still ‘tis night;\n\n      Then bravely wake--then bravely wake!\n\n\nThe Dakota women were wont to cut and bring their fuel from the woods\nand, in fact, to perform most of the drudgery of the camp. This of\nnecessity fell to their lot, because the men must follow the game\nduring the day. Very often my grandmother carried me with her on these\nexcursions; and while she worked it was her habit to suspend me from a\nwild grape vine or a springy bough, so that the least breeze would swing\nthe cradle to and fro.\n\nShe has told me that when I had grown old enough to take notice, I\nwas apparently capable of holding extended conversations in an unknown\ndialect with birds and red squirrels. Once I fell asleep in my cradle,\nsuspended five or six feet from the ground, while Uncheedah was some\ndistance away, gathering birch bark for a canoe. A squirrel had found it\nconvenient to come upon the bow of my cradle and nibble his hickory nut,\nuntil he awoke me by dropping the crumbs of his meal. My disapproval\nof his intrusion was so decided that he had to take a sudden and quick\nflight to another bough, and from there he began to pour out his wrath\nupon me, while I continued my objections to his presence so audibly that\nUncheedah soon came to my rescue, and compelled the bold intruder to\ngo away. It was a common thing for birds to alight on my cradle in the\nwoods.\n\nMy food was, at first, a troublesome question for my kind foster-mother.\nShe cooked some wild rice and strained it, and mixed it with broth made\nfrom choice venison. She also pounded dried venison almost to a flour,\nand kept it in water till the nourishing juices were extracted, then\nmixed with it some pounded maize, which was browned before pounding.\nThis soup of wild rice, pounded venison and maize was my main-stay. But\nsoon my teeth came--much earlier than the white children usually cut\ntheirs; and then my good nurse gave me a little more varied food, and I\ndid all my own grinding.\n\nAfter I left my cradle, I almost walked away from it, she told me. She\nthen began calling my attention to natural objects. Whenever I heard\nthe song of a bird, she would tell me what bird it came from, something\nafter this fashion:\n\n“Hakadah, listen to Shechoka (the robin) calling his mate. He says he\nhas just found something good to eat.” Or “Listen to Oopehanska (the\nthrush); he is singing for his little wife. He will sing his best.” When\nin the evening the whippoorwill started his song with vim, no further\nthan a stone’s throw from our tent in the woods, she would say to me:\n\n“Hush! It may be an Ojibway scout!”\n\nAgain, when I waked at midnight, she would say:\n\n“Do not cry! Hinakaga (the owl) is watching you from the tree-top.”\n\nI usually covered up my head, for I had perfect faith in my\ngrandmother’s admonitions, and she had given me a dreadful idea of this\nbird. It was one of her legends that a little boy was once standing just\noutside of the teepee (tent), crying vigorously for his mother, when\nHinakaga swooped down in the darkness and carried the poor little\nfellow up into the trees. It was well known that the hoot of the owl was\ncommonly imitated by Indian scouts when on the war-path. There had been\ndreadful massacres immediately following this call. Therefore it was\ndeemed wise to impress the sound early upon the mind of the child.\n\nIndian children were trained so that they hardly ever cried much in the\nnight. This was very expedient and necessary in their exposed life. In\nmy infancy it was my grandmother’s custom to put me to sleep, as she\nsaid, with the birds, and to waken me with them, until it became a\nhabit. She did this with an object in view. An Indian must always\nrise early. In the first place, as a hunter, he finds his game best at\ndaybreak. Secondly, other tribes, when on the war-path, usually make\ntheir attack very early in the morning. Even when our people are moving\nabout leisurely, we like to rise before daybreak, in order to travel\nwhen the air is cool, and unobserved, perchance, by our enemies.\n\nAs a little child, it was instilled into me to be silent and reticent.\nThis was one of the most important traits to form in the character\nof the Indian. As a hunter and warrior it was considered absolutely\nnecessary to him, and was thought to lay the foundations of patience and\nself-control. There are times when boisterous mirth is indulged in by\nour people, but the rule is gravity and decorum.\n\nAfter all, my babyhood was full of interest and the beginnings of life’s\nrealities. The spirit of daring was already whispered into my ears. The\nvalue of the eagle feather as worn by the warrior had caught my eye.\nOne day, when I was left alone, at scarcely two years of age, I took my\nuncle’s war bonnet and plucked out all its eagle feathers to decorate my\ndog and myself. So soon the life that was about me had made its impress,\nand already I desired intensely to comply with all of its demands.\n\n\n\n\nII. Early Hardships\n\nONE of the earliest recollections of my adventurous childhood is the\nride I had on a pony’s side. I was passive in the whole matter. A little\ngirl cousin of mine was put in a bag and suspended from the horn of an\nIndian saddle; but her weight must be balanced or the saddle would not\nremain on the animal’s back. Accordingly, I was put into another sack\nand made to keep the saddle and the girl in position! I did not object\nat all, for I had a very pleasant game of peek-aboo with the little\ngirl, until we came to a big snow-drift, where the poor beast was stuck\nfast and began to lie down. Then it was not so nice!\n\nThis was the convenient and primitive way in which some mothers packed\ntheir children for winter journeys. However cold the weather might be,\nthe inmate of the fur-lined sack was usually very comfortable--at least\nI used to think so. I believe I was accustomed to all the precarious\nIndian conveyances, and, as a boy, I enjoyed the dog-travaux ride as\nmuch as any. The travaux consisted of a set of rawhide strips securely\nlashed to the tent-poles, which were harnessed to the sides of the\nanimal as if he stood between shafts, while the free ends were allowed\nto drag on the ground. Both ponies and large dogs were used as beasts of\nburden, and they carried in this way the smaller children as well as the\nbaggage.\n\nThis mode of travelling for children was possible only in the summer,\nand as the dogs were sometimes unreliable, the little ones were exposed\nto a certain amount of danger. For instance, whenever a train of dogs\nhad been travelling for a long time, almost perishing with the heat and\ntheir heavy loads, a glimpse of water would cause them to forget all\ntheir responsibilities. Some of them, in spite of the screams of the\nwomen, would swim with their burdens into the cooling stream, and I was\nthus, on more than one occasion, made to partake of an unwilling bath.\n\nI was a little over four years old at the time of the “Sioux massacre”\n in Minnesota. In the general turmoil, we took flight into British\nColumbia, and the journey is still vividly remembered by all our family.\nA yoke of oxen and a lumber-wagon were taken from some white farmer and\nbrought home for our conveyance.\n\nHow delighted I was when I learned that we were to ride behind those\nwise-looking animals and in that gorgeously painted wagon! It seemed\nalmost like a living creature to me, this new vehicle with four legs,\nand the more so when we got out of axle-grease and the wheels went along\nsquealing like pigs!\n\nThe boys found a great deal of innocent fun in jumping from the high\nwagon while the oxen were leisurely moving along. My elder brothers soon\nbecame experts. At last, I mustered up courage enough to join them in\nthis sport. I was sure they stepped on the wheel, so I cautiously\nplaced my moccasined foot upon it. Alas! before I could realize what had\nhappened, I was under the wheels, and had it not been for the neighbor\nimmediately behind us, I might have been run over by the next team as\nwell.\n\nThis was my first experience with a civilized vehicle. I cried out\nall possible reproaches on the white man’s team and concluded that a\ndog-travaux was good enough for me. I was really rejoiced that we were\nmoving away from the people who made the wagon that had almost ended my\nlife, and it did not occur to me that I alone was to blame. I could not\nbe persuaded to ride in that wagon again and was glad when we finally\nleft it beside the Missouri river.\n\nThe summer after the “Minnesota massacre,” General Sibley pursued our\npeople across this river. Now the Missouri is considered one of the most\ntreacherous rivers in the world. Even a good modern boat is not safe\nupon its uncertain current. We were forced to cross in buffalo-skin\nboats--as round as tubs!\n\nThe Washechu (white men) were coming in great numbers with their big\nguns, and while most of our men were fighting them to gain time, the\nwomen and the old men made and equipped the temporary boats, braced with\nribs of willow. Some of these were towed by two or three women or men\nswimming in the water and some by ponies. It was not an easy matter to\nkeep them right side up, with their helpless freight of little children\nand such goods as we possessed.\n\nIn our flight, we little folks were strapped in the saddles or held in\nfront of an older person, and in the long night marches to get away from\nthe soldiers, we suffered from loss of sleep and insufficient food. Our\nmeals were eaten hastily, and sometimes in the saddle. Water was not\nalways to be found. The people carried it with them in bags formed of\ntripe or the dried pericardium of animals.\n\nNow we were compelled to trespass upon the country of hostile tribes\nand were harassed by them almost daily and nightly. Only the strictest\nvigilance saved us.\n\nOne day we met with another enemy near the British lines. It was a\nprairie fire. We were surrounded. Another fire was quickly made, which\nsaved our lives.\n\nOne of the most thrilling experiences of the following winter was a\nblizzard, which overtook us in our wanderings. Here and there, a family\nlay down in the snow, selecting a place where it was not likely to drift\nmuch. For a day and a night we lay under the snow. Uncle stuck a long\npole beside us to tell us when the storm was over. We had plenty of\nbuffalo robes and the snow kept us warm, but we found it heavy. After\na time, it became packed and hollowed out around our bodies, so that we\nwere as comfortable as one can be under those circumstances.\n\nThe next day the storm ceased, and we discovered a large herd of\nbuffaloes almost upon us. We dug our way out, shot some of the\nbuffaloes, made a fire and enjoyed a good dinner.\n\nI was now an exile as well as motherless; yet I was not unhappy. Our\nwanderings from place to place afforded us many pleasant experiences and\nquite as many hardships and misfortunes. There were times of plenty\nand times of scarcity, and we had several narrow escapes from death. In\nsavage life, the early spring is the most trying time and almost all the\nfamines occurred at this period of the year.\n\nThe Indians are a patient and a clannish people; their love for one\nanother is stronger than that of any civilized people I know. If this\nwere not so, I believe there would have been tribes of cannibals among\nthem. White people have been known to kill and eat their companions in\npreference to starving; but Indians--never!\n\nIn times of famine, the adults often denied themselves in order to make\nthe food last as long as possible for the children, who were not able to\nbear hunger as well as the old. As a people, they can live without food\nmuch longer than any other nation.\n\nI once passed through one of these hard springs when we had nothing\nto eat for several days. I well remember the six small birds which\nconstituted the breakfast for six families one morning; and then we had\nno dinner or supper to follow! What a relief that was to me--although I\nhad only a small wing of a small bird for my share! Soon after this, we\ncame into a region where buffaloes were plenty, and hunger and scarcity\nwere forgotten.\n\nSuch was the Indian’s wild life! When game was to be had and the sun\nshone, they easily forgot the bitter experiences of the winter before.\nLittle preparation was made for the future. They are children of Nature,\nand occasionally she whips them with the lashes of experience, yet they\nare forgetful and careless. Much of their suffering might have been\nprevented by a little calculation.\n\nDuring the summer, when Nature is at her best, and provides abundantly\nfor the savage, it seems to me that no life is happier than his! Food is\nfree--lodging free--everything free! All were alike rich in the summer,\nand, again, all were alike poor in the winter and early spring. However,\ntheir diseases were fewer and not so destructive as now, and the\nIndian’s health was generally good. The Indian boy enjoyed such a life\nas almost all boys dream of and would choose for themselves if they were\npermitted to do so.\n\nThe raids made upon our people by other tribes were frequent, and we had\nto be constantly on the watch. I remember at one time a night attack was\nmade upon our camp and all our ponies stampeded. Only a few of them were\nrecovered, and our journeys after this misfortune were effected mostly\nby means of the dog-travaux.\n\nThe second winter after the massacre, my father and my two older\nbrothers, with several others, were betrayed by a half-breed at Winnipeg\nto the United States authorities. As I was then living with my uncle in\nanother part of the country, I became separated from them for ten\nyears. During all this time we believed that they had been killed by the\nwhites, and I was taught that I must avenge their deaths as soon as I\nwas able to go upon the war-path.\n\nI must say a word in regard to the character of this uncle, my father’s\nbrother, who was my adviser and teacher for many years. He was a man\nabout six feet two inches in height, very erect and broad-shouldered. He\nwas known at that time as one of the best hunters and bravest warriors\namong the Sioux in British America, where he still lives, for to this\nday we have failed to persuade him to return to the United States.\n\nHe is a typical Indian--not handsome, but truthful and brave. He had a\nfew simple principles from which he hardly ever departed. Some of these\nI shall describe when I speak of my early training.\n\nIt is wonderful that any children grew up through all the exposures\nand hardships that we suffered in those days! The frail teepee pitched\nanywhere, in the winter as well as in the summer, was all the protection\nthat we had against cold and storms. I can recall times when we were\nsnowed in and it was very difficult to get fuel. We were once three\ndays without much fire and all of this time it stormed violently. There\nseemed to be no special anxiety on the part of our people; they rather\nlooked upon all this as a matter of course, knowing that the storm would\ncease when the time came.\n\nI could once endure as much cold and hunger as any of them; but now if I\nmiss one meal or accidentally wet my feet, I feel it as much as if I\nhad never lived in the manner I have described, when it was a matter of\ncourse to get myself soaking wet many a time. Even if there was plenty\nto eat, it was thought better for us to practice fasting sometimes; and\nhard exercise was kept up continually, both for the sake of health and\nto prepare the body for the extraordinary exertions that it might, at\nany moment, be required to undergo. In my own remembrance, my uncle used\noften to bring home a deer on his shoulder. The distance was sometimes\nconsiderable; yet he did not consider it any sort of a feat.\n\nThe usual custom with us was to eat only two meals a day and these were\nserved at each end of the day. This rule was not invariable, however,\nfor if there should be any callers, it was Indian etiquette to offer\neither tobacco or food, or both. The rule of two meals a day was more\nclosely observed by the men--especially the younger men--than by the\nwomen and children. This was when the Indians recognized that a true\nmanhood, one of physical activity and endurance, depends upon dieting\nand regular exercise. No such system is practised by the reservation\nIndians of to-day.\n\n\n\n\nIII. My Indian Grandmother\n\nAS a motherless child, I always regarded my good grandmother as the\nwisest of guides and the best of protectors. It was not long before I\nbegan to realize her superiority to most of her contemporaries. This\nidea was not gained entirely from my own observation, but also from a\nknowledge of the high regard in which she was held by other women.\nAside from her native talent and ingenuity, she was endowed with a truly\nwonderful memory. No other midwife in her day and tribe could compete\nwith her in skill and judgment. Her observations in practice were all\npreserved in her mind for reference, as systematically as if they had\nbeen written upon the pages of a note-book.\n\nI distinctly recall one occasion when she took me with her into the\nwoods in search of certain medicinal roots.\n\n“Why do you not use all kinds of roots for medicines?” said I.\n\n“Because,” she replied, in her quick, characteristic manner, “the\nGreat Mystery does not will us to find things too easily. In that case\neverybody would be a medicine-giver, and Ohiyesa must learn that there\nare many secrets which the Great Mystery will disclose only to the most\nworthy. Only those who seek him fasting and in solitude will receive his\nsigns.”\n\nWith this and many similar explanations she wrought in my soul wonderful\nand lively conceptions of the “Great Mystery” and of the effects of\nprayer and solitude. I continued my childish questioning.\n\n“But why did you not dig those plants that we saw in the woods, of the\nsame kind that you are digging now?”\n\n“For the same reason that we do not like the berries we find in the\nshadow of deep woods as well as the ones which grow in sunny places. The\nlatter have more sweetness and flavor. Those herbs which have medicinal\nvirtues should be sought in a place that is neither too wet nor too\ndry, and where they have a generous amount of sunshine to maintain their\nvigor.\n\n“Some day Ohiyesa will be old enough to know the secrets of medicine;\nthen I will tell him all. But if you should grow up to be a bad man, I\nmust withhold these treasures from you and give them to your brother,\nfor a medicine man must be a good and wise man. I hope Ohiyesa will be\na great medicine man when he grows up. To be a great warrior is a noble\nambition; but to be a mighty medicine man is a nobler!”\n\nShe said these things so thoughtfully and impressively that I cannot but\nfeel and remember them even to this day.\n\nOur native women gathered all the wild rice, roots, berries and fruits\nwhich formed an important part of our food. This was distinctively\na woman’s work. Uncheedah (grandmother) understood these matters\nperfectly, and it became a kind of instinct with her to know just where\nto look for each edible variety and at what season of the year. This\nsort of labor gave the Indian women every opportunity to observe and\nstudy Nature after their fashion; and in this Uncheedah was more acute\nthan most of the men. The abilities of her boys were not all inherited\nfrom their father; indeed, the stronger family traits came obviously\nfrom her. She was a leader among the native women, and they came to her,\nnot only for medical aid, but for advice in all their affairs.\n\nIn bravery she equaled any of the men. This trait, together with her\ningenuity and alertness of mind, more than once saved her and her people\nfrom destruction. Once, when we were roaming over a region occupied by\nother tribes, and on a day when most of the men were out upon the hunt,\na party of hostile Indians suddenly appeared. Although there were a few\nmen left at home, they were taken by surprise at first and scarcely knew\nwhat to do, when this woman came forward and advanced alone to meet our\nfoes. She had gone some distance when some of the men followed her.\nShe met the strangers and offered her hand to them. They accepted\nher friendly greeting; and as a result of her brave act we were left\nunmolested and at peace.\n\nAnother story of her was related to me by my father. My grandfather, who\nwas a noted hunter, often wandered away from his band in search of game.\nIn this instance he had with him only his own family of three boys and\nhis wife. One evening, when he returned from the chase, he found to his\nsurprise that she had built a stockade around her teepee.\n\nShe had discovered the danger-sign in a single foot-print, which she saw\nat a glance was not that of her husband, and she was also convinced that\nit was not the foot-print of a Sioux, from the shape of the moccasin.\nThis ability to recognize footprints is general among the Indians, but\nmore marked in certain individuals.\n\nThis courageous woman had driven away a party of five Ojibway warriors.\nThey approached the lodge cautiously, but her dog gave timely warning,\nand she poured into them from behind her defences the contents of a\ndouble-barrelled gun, with such good effect that the astonished braves\nthought it wise to retreat.\n\nI was not more than five or six years old when the Indian soldiers came\none day and destroyed our large buffalo-skin teepee. It was charged\nthat my uncle had hunted alone a large herd of buffaloes. This was\nnot exactly true. He had unfortunately frightened a large herd while\nshooting a deer in the edge of the woods. However, it was customary to\npunish such an act severely, even though the offense was accidental.\n\nWhen we were attacked by the police, I was playing in the teepee, and\nthe only other person at home was Uncheedah. I had not noticed their\napproach, and when the war-cry was given by thirty or forty Indians with\nstrong lungs, I thought my little world was coming to an end. Instantly\ninnumerable knives and tomahawks penetrated our frail home, while\nbullets went through the poles and tent-fastenings up above our heads.\n\nI hardly know what I did, but I imagine it was just what any other\nlittle fellow would have done under like circumstances. My first clear\nrealization of the situation was when Uncheedah had a dispute with the\nleader, claiming that the matter had not been properly investigated,\nand that none of the policemen had attained to a reputation in war which\nwould justify them in touching her son’s teepee. But alas! our poor\ndwelling was already an unrecognizable ruin; even the poles were broken\ninto splinters.\n\nThe Indian women, after reaching middle age, are usually heavy and lack\nagility, but my grandmother was in this also an exception. She was fully\nsixty when I was born; and when I was seven years old she swam across a\nswift and wide stream, carrying me on her back, because she did not wish\nto expose me to accident in one of the clumsy round boats of bull-hide\nwhich were rigged up to cross the rivers which impeded our way,\nespecially in the springtime. Her strength and endurance were\nremarkable. Even after she had attained the age of eighty-two, she one\nday walked twenty-five miles without appearing much fatigued.\n\nI marvel now at the purity and elevated sentiment possessed by this\nwoman, when I consider the customs and habits of her people at the time.\nWhen her husband died she was still comparatively a young woman--still\nactive, clever and industrious. She was descended from a haughty\nchieftain of the “Dwellers among the Leaves.” Although women of her\nage and position were held to be eligible to re-marriage, and she had\nseveral persistent suitors who were men of her own age and chiefs, yet\nshe preferred to cherish in solitude the memory of her husband.\n\nI was very small when my uncle brought home two Ojibway young women. In\nthe fight in which they were captured, none of the Sioux war party had\nbeen killed; therefore they were sympathized with and tenderly treated\nby the Sioux women. They were apparently happy, although of course they\nfelt deeply the losses sustained at the time of their capture, and they\ndid not fail to show their appreciation of the kindnesses received at\nour hands.\n\nAs I recall now the remarks made by one of them at the time of their\nfinal release, they appear to me quite remarkable. They lived in my\ngrandmother’s family for two years, and were then returned to their\npeople at a great peace council of the two nations. When they were about\nto leave my grandmother, the elder of the two sisters first embraced\nher, and then spoke somewhat as follows:\n\n“You are a brave woman and a true mother. I understand now why your son\nso bravely conquered our band, and took my sister and myself captive.\nI hated him at first, but now I admire him, because he did just what my\nfather, my brother or my husband would have done had they opportunity.\nHe did even more. He saved us from the tomahawks of his fellow-warriors,\nand brought us to his home to know a noble and a brave woman.\n\n“I shall never forget your many favors shown to us. But I must go. I\nbelong to my tribe and I shall return to them. I will endeavor to be a\ntrue woman also, and to teach my boys to be generous warriors like your\nson.”\n\nHer sister chose to remain among the Sioux all her life, and she married\none of our young men.\n\n“I shall make the Sioux and the Ojibways,” she said, “to be as\nbrothers.”\n\nThere are many other instances of intermarriage with captive women.\nThe mother of the well-known Sioux chieftain, Wabashaw, was an Ojibway\nwoman. I once knew a woman who was said to be a white captive. She was\nmarried to a noted warrior, and had a fine family of five boys. She was\nwell accustomed to the Indian ways, and as a child I should not have\nsuspected that she was white. The skins of these people became so\nsunburned and full of paint that it required a keen eye to distinguish\nthem from the real Indians.\n\n\n\n\nIV. An Indian Sugar Camp\n\nWITH the first March thaw the thoughts of the Indian women of my\nchildhood days turned promptly to the annual sugarmaking. This industry\nwas chiefly followed by the old men and women and the children. The rest\nof the tribe went out upon the spring fur-hunt at this season, leaving\nus at home to make the sugar.\n\nThe first and most important of the necessary utensils were the huge\niron and brass kettles for boiling. Everything else could be made, but\nthese must be bought, begged or borrowed. A maple tree was felled and\na log canoe hollowed out, into which the sap was to be gathered. Little\ntroughs of basswood and birchen basins were also made to receive the\nsweet drops as they trickled from the tree.\n\nAs soon as these labors were accomplished, we all proceeded to the bark\nsugar house, which stood in the midst of a fine grove of maples on the\nbank of the Minnesota river. We found this hut partially filled with the\nsnows of winter and the withered leaves of the preceding autumn, and it\nmust be cleared for our use. In the meantime a tent was pitched outside\nfor a few days’ occupancy. The snow was still deep in the woods, with a\nsolid crust upon which we could easily walk; for we usually moved to the\nsugar house before the sap had actually started, the better to complete\nour preparations.\n\nMy grandmother worked like a beaver in these days (or rather like\na muskrat, as the Indians say; for this industrious little animal\nsometimes collects as many as six or eight bushels of edible roots for\nthe winter, only to be robbed of his store by some of our people). If\nthere was prospect of a good sugaring season, she now made a second\nand even a third canoe to contain the sap. These canoes were afterward\nutilized by the hunters for their proper purpose.\n\nDuring our last sugar-making in Minnesota, before the “outbreak,” my\ngrandmother was at work upon a canoe with her axe, while a young aunt\nof mine stood by. We boys were congregated within the large, oval\nsugar house, busily engaged in making arrows for the destruction of the\nrabbits and chipmunks which we knew would come in numbers to drink the\nsap. The birds also were beginning to return, and the cold storms of\nMarch would drive them to our door. I was then too young to do much\nexcept look on; but I fully entered into the spirit of the occasion,\nand rejoiced to see the bigger boys industriously sharpen their arrows,\nresting them against the ends of the long sticks which were burning\nin the fire, and occasionally cutting a chip from the stick. In their\neagerness they paid little attention to this circumstance, although they\nwell knew that it was strictly forbidden to touch a knife to a burning\nember.\n\nSuddenly loud screams were heard from without and we all rushed out to\nsee what was the matter. It was a serious affair. My grandmother’s axe\nhad slipped, and by an upward stroke nearly severed three of the fingers\nof my aunt, who stood looking on, with her hands folded upon her waist.\nAs we ran out the old lady, who had already noticed and reproved our\ncarelessness in regard to the burning embers, pursued us with loud\nreproaches and threats of a whipping. This will seem mysterious to my\nreaders, but is easily explained by the Indian superstition, which holds\nthat such an offense as we had committed is invariably punished by the\naccidental cutting of some one of the family.\n\nMy grandmother did not confine herself to canoe-making. She also\ncollected a good supply of fuel for the fires, for she would not have\nmuch time to gather wood when the sap began to flow. Presently the\nweather moderated and the snow began to melt. The month of April brought\nshowers which carried most of it off into the Minnesota river. Now the\nwomen began to test the trees-moving leisurely among them, axe in hand,\nand striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. The\ntrees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to\nyield up their life-blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of\nthe birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven\ndeep into the cut which the axe had made. From the corners of this\nchip--at first drop by drop, then more freely-the sap trickled into the\nlittle dishes.\n\nIt is usual to make sugar from maples, but several other trees were also\ntapped by the Indians. From the birch and ash was made a dark-colored\nsugar, with a somewhat bitter taste, which was used for medicinal\npurposes. The box-elder yielded a beautiful white sugar, whose only\nfault was that there was never enough of it!\n\nA long fire was now made in the sugar house, and a row of brass kettles\nsuspended over the blaze. The sap was collected by the women in tin or\nbirchen buckets and poured into the canoes, from which the kettles\nwere kept filled. The hearts of the boys beat high with pleasant\nanticipations when they heard the welcome hissing sound of the boiling\nsap! Each boy claimed one kettle for his especial charge. It was his\nduty to see that the fire was kept up under it, to watch lest it boil\nover, and finally, when the sap became sirup, to test it upon the snow,\ndipping it out with a wooden paddle. So frequent were these tests that\nfor the first day or two we consumed nearly all that could be made; and\nit was not until the sweetness began to pall that my grandmother set\nherself in earnest to store up sugar for future use. She made it into\ncakes of various forms, in birchen molds, and sometimes in hollow canes\nor reeds, and the bills of ducks and geese. Some of it was pulverized\nand packed in rawhide cases. Being a prudent woman, she did not give it\nto us after the first month or so, except upon special occasions, and it\nwas thus made to last almost the year around. The smaller candies were\nreserved as an occasional treat for the little fellows, and the sugar\nwas eaten at feasts with wild rice or parched corn, and also with\npounded dried meat. Coffee and tea, with their substitutes, were all\nunknown to us in those days.\n\nEvery pursuit has its trials and anxieties. My grandmother’s special\ntribulations, during the sugaring season, were the upsetting and gnawing\nof holes in her birch-bark pans. The transgressors were the rabbit and\nsquirrel tribes, and we little boys for once became useful, in shooting\nthem with our bows and arrows. We hunted all over the sugar camp,\nuntil the little creatures were fairly driven out of the neighborhood.\nOccasionally one of my older brothers brought home a rabbit or two, and\nthen we had a feast.\n\nThe sugaring season extended well into April, and the returning birds\nmade the precincts of our camp joyful with their songs. I often followed\nmy older brothers into the woods, although I was then but four or five\nyears old. Upon one of these excursions they went so far that I ventured\nback alone. When within sight of our hut, I saw a chipmunk sitting upon\na log, and uttering the sound he makes when he calls to his mate. How\nglorious it would be, I thought, if I could shoot him with my tiny bow\nand arrows! Stealthily and cautiously I approached, keeping my eyes upon\nthe pretty little animal, and just as I was about to let fly my shaft,\nI heard a hissing noise at my feet. There lay a horrid snake, coiled and\nready to spring! Forgetful that I was a warrior, I gave a loud scream\nand started backward; but soon recollecting myself, looked down with\nshame, although no one was near. However, I retreated to the inclined\ntrunk of a fallen tree, and there, as I have often been told, was\noverheard soliloquizing in the following words: “I wonder if a snake can\nclimb a tree!”\n\nI remember on this occasion of our last sugar bush in Minnesota, that\nI stood one day outside of our hut and watched the approach of a\nvisitor--a bent old man, his hair almost white, and carrying on his back\na large bundle of red willow, or kinnikinick, which the Indians use for\nsmoking. He threw down his load at the door and thus saluted us: “You\nhave indeed perfect weather for sugar-making.”\n\nIt was my great-grandfather, Cloud Man, whose original village was on\nthe shores of Lakes Calhoun and Harriet, now in the suburbs of the city\nof Minneapolis. He was the first Sioux chief to welcome the Protestant\nmissionaries among his people, and a well-known character in those\npioneer days. He brought us word that some of the peaceful sugar-makers\nnear us on the river had been attacked and murdered by roving Ojibways.\nThis news disturbed us not a little, for we realized that we too might\nbecome the victims of an Ojibway war party. Therefore we all felt some\nuneasiness from this time until we returned heavy laden to our village.\n\n\n\n\n\nV. A Midsummer Feast\n\nIT was midsummer. Everything that the Santee Sioux had undertaken during\nthe year had been unusually successful. The spring fur-hunters had been\nfortunate, and the heavy winter had proved productive of much\nmaple sugar. The women’s patches of maize and potatoes were already\nsufficiently advanced to use. The Wahpetonwan band of Sioux, the\n“Dwellers among the Leaves,” were fully awakened to the fact that it was\nalmost time for the midsummer festivities of the old, wild days.\n\nThe invitations were bundles of tobacco, and acceptances were sent back\nfrom the various bands--the “Light Lodges”, “Dwellers back from the\nRiver,” and many others, in similar fashion. Blue Earth, chief of the\n“Dwellers among the Leaves,” was the host.\n\nThere were to be many different kinds of athletic games; indeed, the\nfestival was something like a State fair, in that there were many side\nshows and competitive events. For instance, supposing that (Miss) White\nRabbit should desire to give a “maidens’ feast,” she would employ a\ncrier to go among the different bands announcing the fact in a sing-song\nmanner:\n\n“Miss White Rabbit will receive her maiden friends to-day at noon,\ninside of the circular encampment of the Kaposia band.”\n\nAgain, should (Mr.) Sleepy Eye wish to have his child’s ears\npierced publicly, he would have to give away a great deal of savage\nwealth--namely, otter, bear and beaver skins and ponies--or the child\nwould not be considered as belonging to a family in good standing.\n\nBut the one all-important event of the occasion was the lacrosse game,\nfor which it had been customary to select those two bands which could\nboast the greater number of fast runners.\n\nThe Wahpetonwan village on the banks of the Minnesota river was alive\nwith the newly-arrived guests and the preparations for the coming event.\nMeat of wild game had been put away with much care during the previous\nfall in anticipation of this feast. There was wild rice and the choicest\nof dried venison that had been kept all winter, as well as freshly dug\nturnips, ripe berries and an abundance of fresh meat.\n\nAlong the edge of the woods the teepees were pitched in groups or\nsemi-circles, each band distinct from the others. The teepee of Mankato\nor Blue Earth was pitched in a conspicuous spot. Just over the entrance\nwas painted in red and yellow a picture of a pipe, and directly opposite\nthis the rising sun. The painting was symbolic of welcome and good will\nto men under the bright sun.\n\nA meeting was held to appoint some “medicine man” to make the balls\nthat were to be used in the lacrosse contest; and presently the herald\nannounced that this honor had been conferred upon old Chankpee-yuhah,\nor “Keeps the Club,” while every other man of his profession was\ndisappointed. He was a powerful man physically, who had apparently won\nthe confidence of the people by his fine personal appearance and by\nworking upon superstitious minds.\n\nTowards evening he appeared in the circle, leading by the hand a boy\nabout four years old. Closely the little fellow observed every motion\nof the man; nothing escaped his vigilant black eyes, which seemed\nconstantly to grow brighter and larger, while his exuberant glossy black\nhair was plaited and wound around his head like that of a Celestial. He\nwore a bit of swan’s down in each ear, which formed a striking contrast\nwith the child’s complexion. Further than this, the boy was painted\naccording to the fashion of the age. He held in his hands a miniature\nbow and arrows.\n\nThe medicine man drew himself up in an admirable attitude, and proceeded\nto make his short speech:\n\n“Wahpetonwans, you boast that you run down the elk; you can outrun the\nOjibways. Before you all, I dedicate to you this red ball. Kaposias, you\nclaim that no one has a lighter foot than you; you declare that you can\nendure running a whole day without water. To you I dedicate this black\nball. Either you or the Leaf-Dwellers will have to drop your eyes and\nbow your head when the game is over. I wish to announce that if the\nWahpetonwans should win, this little warrior shall bear the name Ohiyesa\n(winner) through life; but if the Light Lodges should win, let the name\nbe given to any child appointed by them.”\n\nThe ground selected for the great final game was on a narrow strip of\nland between a lake and the river. It was about three quarters of a mile\nlong and a quarter of a mile in width. The spectators had already ranged\nthemselves all along the two sides, as well as at the two ends, which\nwere somewhat higher than the middle. The soldiers appointed to keep\norder furnished much of the entertainment of the day. They painted\nartistically and tastefully, according to the Indian fashion, not only\ntheir bodies but also their ponies and clubs. They were so strict in\nenforcing the laws that no one could venture with safety within a few\nfeet of the limits of the field.\n\nNow all of the minor events and feasts, occupying several days’ time,\nhad been observed. Heralds on ponies’ backs announced that all who\nintended to participate in the final game were requested to repair to\nthe ground; also that if any one bore a grudge against another, he was\nimplored to forget his ill-feeling until the contest should be over.\n\nThe most powerful men were stationed at the half-way ground, while\nthe fast runners were assigned to the back. It was an impressive\nspectacle--a fine collection of agile forms, almost stripped of garments\nand painted in wild imitation of the rainbow and sunset sky on human\ncanvas. Some had undertaken to depict the Milky Way across their tawny\nbodies, and one or two made a bold attempt to reproduce the lightning.\nOthers contented themselves with painting the figure of some fleet\nanimal or swift bird on their muscular chests.\n\nThe coiffure of the Sioux lacrosse player has often been unconsciously\nimitated by the fashionable hair-dressers of modern times. Some banged\nand singed their hair; others did a little more by adding powder. The\nGrecian knot was located on the wrong side of the head, being tied\ntightly over the forehead. A great many simply brushed back their long\nlocks and tied them with a strip of otter skin.\n\nAt the middle of the ground were stationed four immense men,\nmagnificently formed. A fifth approached this group, paused a moment,\nand then threw his head back, gazed up into the sky in the manner of a\ncock and gave a smooth, clear operatic tone. Instantly the little black\nball went up between the two middle rushers, in the midst of yells,\ncheers and war-whoops. Both men endeavored to catch it in the air;\nbut alas! each interfered with the other; then the guards on each side\nrushed upon them. For a time, a hundred lacrosse sticks vied with each\nother, and the wriggling human flesh and paint were all one could see\nthrough the cloud of dust. Suddenly there shot swiftly through the\nair toward the south, toward the Kaposias’ goal, the ball. There was\na general cheer from their adherents, which echoed back from the white\ncliff on the opposite side of the Minnesota.\n\nAs the ball flew through the air, two adversaries were ready to receive\nit. The Kaposia quickly met the ball, but failed to catch it in his\nnetted bag, for the other had swung his up like a flash. Thus it struck\nthe ground, but had no opportunity to bound up when a Wahpeton pounced\nupon it like a cat and slipped out of the grasp of his opponents. A\nmighty cheer thundered through the air.\n\nThe warrior who had undertaken to pilot the little sphere was risking\nmuch, for he must dodge a host of Kaposias before he could gain any\nground. He was alert and agile; now springing like a panther, now\nleaping like a deer over a stooping opponent who tried to seize him\naround the waist. Every opposing player was upon his heels, while those\nof his own side did all in their power to clear the way for him. But it\nwas all in vain. He only gained fifty paces.\n\nThus the game went. First one side, then the other would gain an\nadvantage, and then it was lost, until the herald proclaimed that it was\ntime to change the ball. No victory was in sight for either side.\n\nAfter a few minutes’ rest, the game was resumed. The red ball was now\ntossed in the air in the usual way. No sooner had it descended than\none of the rushers caught it and away it went northward; again it was\nfortunate, for it was advanced by one of the same side. The scene was\nnow one of the wildest excitement and confusion. At last, the northward\nflight of the ball was checked for a moment and a desperate struggle\nensued. Cheers and war-whoops became general, such as were never equaled\nin any concourse of savages, and possibly nowhere except at a college\ngame of football.\n\nThe ball had not been allowed to come to the surface since it reached\nthis point, for there were more than a hundred men who scrambled for\nit. Suddenly a warrior shot out of the throng like the ball itself!\nThen some of the players shouted: “Look out for Antelope! Look out for\nAntelope!” But it was too late. The little sphere had already nestled\ninto Antelope’s palm and that fleetest of Wahpetons had thrown down his\nlacrosse stick and set a determined eye upon the northern goal.\n\nSuch a speed! He had cleared almost all the opponents’ guards--there\nwere but two more. These were exceptional runners of the Kaposias. As\nhe approached them in his almost irresistible speed, every savage heart\nthumped louder in the Indian’s dusky bosom. In another moment there\nwould be a defeat for the Kaposias or a prolongation of the game. The\ntwo men, with a determined look approached their foe like two panthers\nprepared to spring; yet he neither slackened his speed nor deviated from\nhis course. A crash--a mighty shout!--the two Kaposias collided, and the\nswift Antelope had won the laurels!\n\nThe turmoil and commotion at the victors’ camp were indescribable. A\nfew beats of a drum were heard, after which the criers hurried along the\nlines, announcing the last act to be performed at the camp of the “Leaf\nDwellers.”\n\nThe day had been a perfect one. Every event had been a success; and, as\na matter of course, the old people were happy, for they largely profited\nby these occasions. Within the circle formed by the general assembly sat\nin a group the members of the common council. Blue Earth arose, and in a\nfew appropriate and courteous remarks assured his guests that it was\nnot selfishness that led his braves to carry off the honors of the last\nevent, but that this was a friendly contest in which each band must\nassert its prowess. In memory of this victory, the boy would now receive\nhis name. A loud “Ho-o-o” of approbation reverberated from the edge of\nthe forest upon the Minnesota’s bank.\n\nHalf frightened, the little fellow was now brought into the circle,\nlooking very much as if he were about to be executed. Cheer after cheer\nwent up for the awe-stricken boy. Chankpee-yuhah, the medicine man,\nproceeded to confer the name.\n\n“Ohiyesa (or Winner) shall be thy name henceforth. Be brave, be patient\nand thou shalt always win! Thy name is Ohivesa.”\n\n\n\n\nII. AN INDIAN BOY’S TRAINING\n\nIT is commonly supposed that there is no systematic education of their\nchildren among the aborigines of this country. Nothing could be farther\nfrom the truth. All the customs of this primitive people were held to\nbe divinely instituted, and those in connection with the training\nof children were scrupulously adhered to and transmitted from one\ngeneration to another.\n\nThe expectant parents conjointly bent all their efforts to the task\nof giving the new-comer the best they could gather from a long line\nof ancestors. A pregnant Indian woman would often choose one of the\ngreatest characters of her family and tribe as a model for her child.\nThis hero was daily called to mind. She would gather from tradition all\nof his noted deeds and daring exploits, rehearsing them to herself when\nalone. In order that the impression might be more distinct, she avoided\ncompany. She isolated herself as much as possible, and wandered in\nsolitude, not thoughtlessly, but with an eye to the impress given by\ngrand and beautiful scenery.\n\nThe Indians believed, also, that certain kinds of animals would confer\npeculiar gifts upon the unborn, while others would leave so strong an\nadverse impression that the child might become a monstrosity. A case\nof hare-lip was commonly attributed to the rabbit. It was said that a\nrabbit had charmed the mother and given to the babe its own features.\nEven the meat of certain animals was denied the pregnant woman, because\nit was supposed to influence the disposition or features of the child.\n\nScarcely was the embyro warrior ushered into the world, when he was met\nby lullabies that speak of wonderful exploits in hunting and war. Those\nideas which so fully occupied his mother’s mind before his birth are now\nput into words by all about the child, who is as yet quite unresponsive\nto their appeals to his honor and ambition. He is called the future\ndefender of his people, whose lives may depend upon his courage and\nskill. If the child is a girl, she is at once addressed as the future\nmother of a noble race.\n\nIn hunting songs, the leading animals are introduced; they come to the\nboy to offer their bodies for the sustenance of his tribe. The animals\nare regarded as his friends, and spoken of almost as tribes of people,\nor as his cousins, grandfathers and grandmothers. The songs of wooing,\nadapted as lullabies, were equally imaginative, and the suitors were\noften animals personified, while pretty maidens were represented by the\nmink and the doe.\n\nVery early, the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and\ntransmitting the legends of his ancestors and his race. Almost every\nevening a myth, or a true story of some deed done in the past, was\nnarrated by one of the parents or grandparents, while the boy listened\nwith parted lips and glistening eyes. On the following evening, he\nwas usually required to repeat it. If he was not an apt scholar, he\nstruggled long with his task; but, as a rule, the Indian boy is a good\nlistener and has a good memory, so that the stories were tolerably well\nmastered. The household became his audience, by which he was alternately\ncriticized and applauded.\n\nThis sort of teaching at once enlightens the boy’s mind and stimulates\nhis ambition. His conception of his own future career becomes a vivid\nand irresistible force. Whatever there is for him to learn must be\nlearned; whatever qualifications are necessary to a truly great man he\nmust seek at any expense of danger and hardship. Such was the feeling\nof the imaginative and brave young Indian. It became apparent to him in\nearly life that he must accustom himself to rove alone and not to fear\nor dislike the impression of solitude.\n\nIt seems to be a popular idea that all the characteristic skill of\nthe Indian is instinctive and hereditary. This is a mistake. All the\nstoicism and patience of the Indian are acquired traits, and continual\npractice alone makes him master of the art of wood-craft. Physical\ntraining and dieting were not neglected. I remember that I was not\nallowed to have beef soup or any warm drink. The soup was for the old\nmen. General rules for the young were never to take their food very hot,\nnor to drink much water.\n\nMy uncle, who educated me up to the age of fifteen years, was a strict\ndisciplinarian and a good teacher. When I left the teepee in the\nmorning, he would say: “Hakadah, look closely to everything you see”;\nand at evening, on my return, he used often to catechize me for an hour\nor so.\n\n“On which side of the trees is the lighter-colored bark? On which side\ndo they have most regular branches?”\n\nIt was his custom to let me name all the new birds that I had seen\nduring the day. I would name them according to the color or the shape\nof the bill or their song or the appearance and locality of the nest--in\nfact, anything about the bird that impressed me as characteristic. I\nmade many ridiculous errors, I must admit. He then usually informed me\nof the correct name. Occasionally I made a hit and this he would warmly\ncommend.\n\nHe went much deeper into this science when I was a little older, that\nis, about the age of eight or nine years. He would say, for instance:\n\n“How do you know that there are fish in yonder lake?”\n\n“Because they jump out of the water for flies at mid-day.”\n\nHe would smile at my prompt but superficial reply.\n\n“What do you think of the little pebbles grouped together under the\nshallow water? and what made the pretty curved marks in the sandy bottom\nand the little sand-banks? Where do you find the fish-eating birds? Have\nthe inlet and the outlet of a lake anything to do with the question?”\n\nHe did not expect a correct reply at once to all the voluminous\nquestions that he put to me on these occasions, but he meant to make me\nobservant and a good student of nature.\n\n“Hakadah,” he would say to me, “you ought to follow the example of the\nshunktokecha (wolf). Even when he is surprised and runs for his life,\nhe will pause to take one more look at you before he enters his final\nretreat. So you must take a second look at everything you see.\n\n“It is better to view animals unobserved. I have been a witness to their\ncourtships and their quarrels and have learned many of their secrets in\nthis way. I was once the unseen spectator of a thrilling battle between\na pair of grizzly bears and three buffaloes--a rash act for the bears,\nfor it was in the moon of strawberries, when the buffaloes sharpen and\npolish their horns for bloody contests among themselves.\n\n“I advise you, my boy, never to approach a grizzly’s den from the front,\nbut to steal up behind and throw your blanket or a stone in front of the\nhole. He does not usually rush for it, but first puts his head out and\nlistens and then comes out very indifferently and sits on his haunches\non the mound in front of the hole before he makes any attack. While he\nis exposing himself in this fashion, aim at his heart. Always be as cool\nas the animal himself.” Thus he armed me against the cunning of savage\nbeasts by teaching me how to outwit them.\n\n“In hunting,” he would resume, “you will be guided by the habits of the\nanimal you seek. Remember that a moose stays in swampy or low land or\nbetween high mountains near a spring or lake, for thirty to sixty days\nat a time. Most large game moves about continually, except the doe in\nthe spring; it is then a very easy matter to find her with the fawn.\nConceal yourself in a convenient place as soon as you observe any signs\nof the presence of either, and then call with your birchen doe-caller.\n\n“Whichever one hears you first will soon appear in your neighborhood.\nBut you must be very watchful, or you may be made a fawn of by a large\nwild-cat. They understand the characteristic call of the doe perfectly\nwell.\n\n“When you have any difficulty with a bear or a wild-cat--that is, if\nthe creature shows signs of attacking you--you must make him fully\nunderstand that you have seen him and are aware of his intentions. If\nyou are not well equipped for a pitched battle, the only way to make him\nretreat is to take a long sharp-pointed pole for a spear and rush toward\nhim. No wild beast will face this unless he is cornered and already\nwounded, These fierce beasts are generally afraid of the common weapon\nof the larger animals--the horns, and if these are very long and sharp,\nthey dare not risk an open fight.\n\n“There is one exception to this rule--the grey wolf will attack fiercely\nwhen very hungry. But their courage depends upon their numbers; in this\nthey are like white men. One wolf or two will never attack a man. They\nwill stampede a herd of buffaloes in order to get at the calves; they\nwill rush upon a herd of antelopes, for these are helpless; but they are\nalways careful about attacking man.”\n\nOf this nature were the instructions of my uncle, who was widely known\nat that time as among the greatest hunters of his tribe.\n\nAll boys were expected to endure hardship without complaint. In\nsavage warfare, a young man must, of course, be an athlete and used to\nundergoing all sorts of privations. He must be able to go without food\nand water for two or three days without displaying any weakness, or to\nrun for a day and a night without any rest. He must be able to traverse\na pathless and wild country without losing his way either in the day or\nnight time. He cannot refuse to do any of these things if he aspires to\nbe a warrior.\n\nSometimes my uncle would waken me very early in the morning and\nchallenge me to fast with him all day. I had to accept the challenge.\nWe blackened our faces with charcoal, so that every boy in the village\nwould know that I was fasting for the day. Then the little tempters\nwould make my life a misery until the merciful sun hid behind the\nwestern hills.\n\nI can scarcely recall the time when my stern teacher began to give\nsudden war-whoops over my head in the morning while I was sound asleep.\nHe expected me to leap up with perfect presence of mind, always ready\nto grasp a weapon of some sort and to give a shrill whoop in reply. If\nI was sleepy or startled and hardly knew what I was about, he would\nridicule me and say that I need never expect to sell my scalp dear.\nOften he would vary these tactics by shooting off his gun just\noutside of the lodge while I was yet asleep, at the same time giving\nblood-curdling yells. After a time I became used to this.\n\nWhen Indians went upon the war-path, it was their custom to try the new\nwarriors thoroughly before coming to an engagement. For instance, when\nthey were near a hostile camp, they would select the novices to go after\nthe water and make them do all sorts of things to prove their courage.\nIn accordance with this idea, my uncle used to send me off after water\nwhen we camped after dark in a strange place. Perhaps the country was\nfull of wild beasts, and, for aught I knew, there might be scouts from\nhostile bands of Indians lurking in that very neighborhood.\n\nYet I never objected, for that would show cowardice. I picked my way\nthrough the woods, dipped my pail in the water and hurried back, always\ncareful to make as little noise as a cat. Being only a boy, my heart\nwould leap at every crackling of a dry twig or distant hooting of an\nowl, until, at last, I reached our teepee. Then my uncle would perhaps\nsay: “Ah, Hakadah, you are a thorough warrior,” empty out the precious\ncontents of the pail, and order me to go a second time.\n\nImagine how I felt! But I wished to be a brave man as much as a white\nboy desires to be a great lawyer or even President of the United States.\nSilently I would take the pail and endeavor to retrace my footsteps in\nthe dark.\n\nWith all this, our manners and morals were not neglected. I was made to\nrespect the adults and especially the aged. I was not allowed to join in\ntheir discussions, nor even to speak in their presence, unless requested\nto do so. Indian etiquette was very strict, and among the requirements\nwas that of avoiding the direct address. A term of relationship or some\ntitle of courtesy was commonly used instead of the personal name by\nthose who wished to show respect. We were taught generosity to the poor\nand reverence for the “Great Mystery.” Religion was the basis of all\nIndian training.\n\nI recall to the present day some of the kind warnings and reproofs\nthat my good grandmother was wont to give me. “Be strong of heart--be\npatient!” she used to say. She told me of a young chief who was noted\nfor his uncontrollable temper. While in one of his rages he attempted to\nkill a woman, for which he was slain by his own band and left unburied\nas a mark of disgrace--his body was simply covered with green grass. If\nI ever lost my temper, she would say:\n\n“Hakadah, control yourself, or you will be like that young man I told\nyou of, and lie under a green blanket!”\n\nIn the old days, no young man was allowed to use tobacco in any form\nuntil he had become an acknowledged warrior and had achieved a\nrecord. If a youth should seek a wife before he had reached the age of\ntwenty-two or twenty-three, and been recognized as a brave man, he was\nsneered at and considered an ill-bred Indian. He must also be a skillful\nhunter. An Indian cannot be a good husband unless he brings home plenty\nof game.\n\nThese precepts were in the line of our training for the wild life.\n\n\n\n\nIII. MY PLAYS AND PLAYMATES\n\n\n\n\nI. Games and Sports\n\nTHE Indian boy was a prince of the wilderness. He had but very little\nwork to do during the period of his boyhood. His principal occupation\nwas the practice of a few simple arts in warfare and the chase. Aside\nfrom this, he was master of his time.\n\nWhatever was required of us boys was quickly performed: then the field\nwas clear for our games and plays. There was always keen competition\namong us. We felt very much as our fathers did in hunting and war--each\none strove to excel all the others.\n\nIt is true that our savage life was a precarious one, and full of\ndreadful catastrophes; however, this never prevented us from enjoying\nour sports to the fullest extent. As we left our teepees in the morning,\nwe were never sure that our scalps would not dangle from a pole in the\nafternoon! It was an uncertain life, to be sure. Yet we observed that\nthe fawns skipped and played happily while the gray wolves might be\npeeping forth from behind the hills, ready to tear them limb from limb.\n\nOur sports were molded by the life and customs of our people; indeed, we\npracticed only what we expected to do when grown. Our games were feats\nwith the bow and arrow, foot and pony races, wrestling, swimming and\nimitation of the customs and habits of our fathers. We had sham fights\nwith mud balls and willow wands; we played lacrosse, made war upon bees,\nshot winter arrows (which were used only in that season), and coasted\nupon the ribs of animals and buffalo robes.\n\nNo sooner did the boys get together than, as a usual thing, they divided\ninto squads and chose sides; then a leading arrow was shot at random\ninto the air. Before it fell to the ground a volley from the bows of the\nparticipants followed. Each player was quick to note the direction and\nspeed of the leading arrow and he tried to send his own at the same\nspeed and at an equal height, so that when it fell it would be closer to\nthe first than any of the others.\n\nIt was considered out of place to shoot by first sighting the object\naimed at. This was usually impracticable in actual life, because the\nobject was almost always in motion, while the hunter himself was often\nupon the back of a pony at full gallop. Therefore, it was the off-hand\nshot that the Indian boy sought to master. There was another game with\narrows that was characterized by gambling, and was generally confined to\nthe men.\n\nThe races were an every-day occurrence. At noon the boys were usually\ngathered by some pleasant sheet of water and as soon as the ponies were\nwatered, they were allowed to graze for an hour or two, while the boys\nstripped for their noonday sports. A boy might say to some other whom he\nconsidered his equal:\n\n“I can’t run; but I will challenge you to fifty paces.”\n\nA former hero, when beaten, would often explain his defeat by saying: “I\ndrank too much water.”\n\nBoys of all ages were paired for a “spin,” and the little red men\ncheered on their favorites with spirit.\n\nAs soon as this was ended, the pony races followed. All the speedy\nponies were picked out and riders chosen. If a boy declined to ride,\nthere would be shouts of derision.\n\nLast of all came the swimming. A little urchin would hang to his pony’s\nlong tail, while the latter, with only his head above water, glided\nsportively along. Finally the animals were driven into a fine field of\ngrass and we turned our attention to other games.\n\nLacrosse was an older game and was confined entirely to the Sisseton and\nSantee Sioux. Shinny, such as is enjoyed by white boys on the ice, is\nstill played on the open prairie by the western Sioux. The “moccasin\ngame,” although sometimes played by the boys, was intended mainly for\nadults.\n\nThe “mud-and-willow” fight was rather a severe and dangerous sport. A\nlump of soft clay was stuck on the end of a limber and springy willow\nwand and thrown as boys throw apples from sticks, with considerable\nforce. When there were fifty or a hundred players on each side, the\nbattle became warm; but anything to arouse the bravery of Indian boys\nseemed to them a good and wholesome diversion.\n\nWrestling was largely indulged in by us all. It may seem odd,, but\nwrestling was done by a great many boys at once--from ten to any number\non a side. It was really a battle, in which each one chose his opponent.\nThe rule was that if a boy sat down, he was let alone, but as long as\nhe remained standing within the field, he was open to an attack. No one\nstruck with the hand, but all manner of tripping with legs and feet\nand butting with the knees was allowed. Altogether it was an exhausting\npastime--fully equal to the American game of football and only the young\nathlete could really enjoy it.\n\nOne of our most curious sports was a war upon the nests of wild bees.\nWe imagined ourselves about to make an attack upon the Ojibways or some\ntribal foe. We all painted and stole cautiously upon the nest; then,\nwith a rush and warwhoop, sprang upon the object of our attack and\nendeavored to destroy it. But it seemed that the bees were always on the\nalert and never entirely surprised, for they always raised quite as many\nscalps as did their bold assailants! After the onslaught upon the nest\nwas ended, we usually followed it by a pretended scalp dance.\n\nOn the occasion of my first experience in this mode of warfare,\nthere were two other little boys who were also novices. One of them\nparticularly was really too young to indulge in an exploit of that kind.\nAs it was the custom of our people, when they killed or wounded an enemy\non the battle field, to announce the act in a loud voice, we did the\nsame. My friend, Little Wound (as I will call him, for I do not remember\nhis name), being quite small, was unable to reach the nest until it had\nbeen well trampled upon and broken and the insects had made a counter\ncharge with such vigor as to repulse and scatter our numbers in every\ndirection. However, he evidently did not want to retreat without any\nhonors; so he bravely jumped upon the nest and yelled:\n\n“I, the brave Little Wound, to-day kill the only fierce enemy!”\n\nScarcely were the last words uttered when he screamed as if stabbed to\nthe heart. One of his older companions shouted:\n\n“Dive into the water! Run! Dive into the water!” for there was a lake\nnear by. This advice he obeyed.\n\nWhen we had reassembled and were indulging in our mimic dance,\nLittle Wound was not allowed to dance. He was considered not to be in\nexistence--he had been killed by our enemies, the Bee tribe. Poor little\nfellow! His swollen face was sad and ashamed as he sat on a fallen log\nand watched the dance. Although he might well have styled himself one of\nthe noble dead who had died for their country, yet he was not unmindful\nthat he had screamed, and this weakness would be apt to recur to him\nmany times in the future.\n\nWe had some quiet plays which we alternated with the more severe and\nwarlike ones. Among them were throwing wands and snow-arrows. In the\nwinter we coasted much. We had no “double-rippers” or toboggans, but six\nor seven of the long ribs of a buffalo, fastened together at the larger\nend, answered all practical purposes. Sometimes a strip of bass-wood\nbark, four feet long and about six inches wide, was used with\nconsiderable skill. We stood on one end and held the other, using the\nslippery inside of the bark for the outside, and thus coasting down long\nhills with remarkable speed.\n\nThe spinning of tops was one of the all-absorbing winter sports. We made\nour tops heartshaped of wood, horn or bone. We whipped them with a\nlong thong of buckskin. The handle was a stick about a foot long and\nsometimes we whittled the stick to make it spoon-shaped at one end.\n\nWe played games with these tops--two to fifty boys at one time. Each\nwhips his top until it hums; then one takes the lead and the rest follow\nin a sort of obstacle race. The top must spin all the way through. There\nwere bars of snow over which we must pilot our top in the spoon end of\nour whip; then again we would toss it in the air on to another open spot\nof ice or smooth snowcrust from twenty to fifty paces away. The top that\nholds out the longest is the winner.\n\nSometimes we played “medicine dance.” This, to us, was almost what\n“playing church” is among white children, but our people seemed to think\nit an act of irreverence to imitate these dances, therefore performances\nof this kind were always enjoyed in secret. We used to observe all the\nimportant ceremonies and it required something of an actor to reproduce\nthe dramatic features of the dance. The real dances occupied a day and\na night, and the program was long and varied, so that it was not easy\nto execute all the details perfectly; but the Indian children are born\nimitators.\n\nThe boys built an arbor of pine boughs in some out-of-the-way place\nand at one end of it was a rude lodge. This was the medicine lodge\nor headquarters. All the initiates were there. At the further end or\nentrance were the door-keepers or soldiers, as we called them. The\nmembers of each lodge entered in a body, standing in single file and\nfacing the headquarters. Each stretched out his right hand and a prayer\nwas offered by the leader, after which they took the places assigned to\nthem.\n\nWhen the preliminaries had been completed, our leader sounded the big\ndrum and we all said “A-ho-ho-ho!” as a sort of amen. Then the choir\nbegan their song and whenever they ended a verse, we all said again\n“A-ho-ho-ho!” At last they struck up the chorus and we all got upon\nour feet and began to dance, by simply lifting up one foot and then the\nother, with a slight swing to the body.\n\nEach boy was representing or imitating some one of the medicine men.\nWe painted and decorated ourselves just as they did and carried bird or\nsquirrel skins, or occasionally live birds and chipmunks as our medicine\nbags and small white shells or pebbles for medicine charms.\n\nThen the persons to be initiated were brought in and seated, with much\nceremony, upon a blanket or buffalo robe. Directly in front of them\nthe ground was levelled smooth and here we laid an old pipe filled with\ndried leaves for tobacco. Around it we placed the variously colored\nfeathers of the birds we had killed, and cedar and sweetgrass we burned\nfor incense.\n\nFinally those of us who had been selected to perform this ceremony\nstretched out our arms at full length, holding the sacred medicine bags\nand aiming them at the new members. After swinging them four times, we\nshot them suddenly forward, but did not let go. The novices then fell\nforward on their faces as if dead. Quickly a chorus was struck up and\nwe all joined in a lively dance around the supposed bodies. The girls\ncovered them up with their blankets, thus burying the dead. At last we\nresurrected them with our charms and led them to their places among the\naudience. Then came the last general dance and the final feast.\n\nI was often selected as choir-master on these occasions, for I had\nhappened to learn many of the medicine songs and was quite an apt mimic.\nMy grandmother, who was a noted medicine woman of the Turtle lodge, on\nhearing of these sacrilegious acts (as she called them) warned me that\nif any of the medicine men should discover them, they would punish me\nterribly by shriveling my limbs with slow disease.\n\nOccasionally, we also played “white man.” Our knowledge of the pale-face\nwas limited, but we had learned that he brought goods whenever he came\nand that our people exchanged furs for his merchandise. We also knew\nthat his complexion was pale, that he had short hair on his head and\nlong hair on his face and that he wore coat, trousers, and hat, and\ndid not patronize blankets in the daytime. This was the picture we had\nformed of the white man.\n\nSo we painted two or three of our number with white clay and put on them\nbirchen hats which we sewed up for the occasion; fastened a piece of\nfur to their chins for a beard and altered their costumes as much as\nlay within our power. The white of the birch-bark was made to answer for\ntheir white shirts. Their merchandise consisted of sand for sugar, wild\nbeans for coffee, dried leaves for tea, pulverized earth for gun-powder,\npebbles for bullets and clear water for the dangerous “spirit water.” We\ntraded for these goods with skins of squirrels, rabbits and small birds.\n\nWhen we played “hunting buffalo” we would send a few good runners off on\nthe open prairie with a supply of meat; then start a few equally swift\nboys to chase them and capture the food. Once we were engaged in this\nsport when a real hunt by the men was in progress; yet we did not\nrealize that it was so near until, in the midst of our play, we saw\nan immense buffalo coming at full speed directly toward us. Our mimic\nbuffalo hunt turned into a very real buffalo scare. Fortunately, we were\nnear the edge of the woods and we soon disappeared among the leaves\nlike a covey of young prairie-chickens and some hid in the bushes while\nothers took refuge in tall trees.\n\nWe loved to play in the water. When we had no ponies, we often had\nswimming matches of our own and sometimes made rafts with which we\ncrossed lakes and rivers. It was a common thing to “duck” a young or\ntimid boy or to carry him into deep water to struggle as best he might.\n\nI remember a perilous ride with a companion on an unmanageable log, when\nwe were both less than seven years old. The older boys had put us on\nthis uncertain bark and pushed us out into the swift current of the\nriver. I cannot speak for my comrade in distress, but I can say now that\nI would rather ride on a swift bronco any day than try to stay on and\nsteady a short log in a river. I never knew how we managed to prevent a\nshipwreck on that voyage and to reach the shore.\n\nWe had many curious wild pets. There were young foxes, bears, wolves,\nraccoons, fawns, buffalo calves and birds of all kinds, tamed by various\nboys. My pets were different at different times, but I particularly\nremember one. I once had a grizzly bear for a pet and so far as he and I\nwere concerned, our relations were charming and very close. But I hardly\nknow whether he made more enemies for me or I for him. It was his habit\nto treat every boy unmercifully who injured me. He was despised for his\nconduct in my interest and I was hated on account of his interference.\n\n\n\n\nII. My Playmates\n\nCHATANNA was the brother with whom I passed much of my early childhood.\nFrom the time that I was old enough to play with boys, this brother was\nmy close companion. He was a handsome boy, and an affectionate comrade.\nWe played together, slept together and ate together; and as Chatanna was\nthree years the older, I naturally looked up to him as to a superior.\n\nOesedah was a beautiful little character. She was my cousin, and four\nyears younger than myself. Perhaps none of my early playmates are more\nvividly remembered than is this little maiden.\n\nThe name given her by a noted medicine-man was Makah-oesetopah-win.\nIt means The-four-corners-of-the-earth. As she was rather small,\nthe abbreviation with a diminutive termination was considered more\nappropriate, hence Oesedah became her common name.\n\nAlthough she had a very good mother, Uncheedah was her efficient teacher\nand chaperon Such knowledge as my grandmother deemed suitable to a\nmaiden was duly impressed upon her susceptible mind. When I was not in\nthe woods with Chatanna, Oesedah was my companion at home; and when I\nreturned from my play at evening, she would have a hundred questions\nready for me to answer. Some of these were questions concerning our\nevery-day life, and others were more difficult problems which had\nsuddenly dawned upon her active little mind. Whatever had occurred to\ninterest her during the day was immediately repeated for my benefit.\n\nThere were certain questions upon which Oesedah held me to be authority,\nand asked with the hope of increasing her little store of knowledge. I\nhave often heard her declare to her girl companions: “I know it is true;\nOhiyesa said so!” Uncheedah was partly responsible for this, for when\nany questions came up which lay within the sphere of man’s observation,\nshe would say:\n\n“Ohiyesa ought to know that: he is a man-I am not! You had better ask\nhim.”\n\nThe truth was that she had herself explained to me many of the subjects\nunder discussion.\n\nI was occasionally referred to little Oesedah in the same manner, and I\nalways accepted her childish elucidations of any matter upon which I had\nbeen advised to consult her, because I knew the source of her wisdom. In\nthis simple way we were made to be teachers of one another.\n\nVery often we discussed some topic before our common instructor, or\nanswered her questions together, in order to show which had the readier\nmind.\n\n“To what tribe does the lizard belong?” inquired Uncheedah, upon one of\nthese occasions.\n\n“To the four-legged tribe,” I shouted.\n\nOesedah, with her usual quickness, flashed out the answer:\n\n“It belongs to the creeping tribe.”\n\nThe Indians divided all animals into four general classes: 1st, those\nthat walk upon four legs; 2nd, those that fly; 3rd, those that swim with\nfins; 4th, those that creep.\n\nOf course I endeavored to support my assertion that the lizard belongs\nwhere I had placed it, be-. cause he has four distinct legs which propel\nhim everywhere, on the ground or in the water. But my opponent claimed\nthat the creature under dispute does not walk, but creeps. My strongest\nargument was that it had legs; but Oesedah insisted that its body\ntouches the ground as it moves. As a last resort, I volunteered to go\nfind one, and demonstrate the point in question.\n\nThe lizard having been brought, we smoothed off the ground and strewed\nashes on it so that we could see the track. Then I raised the question:\n“What constitutes creeping, and what constitutes walking?”\n\nUncheedah was the judge, and she stated, without any hesitation, that\nan animal must stand clear of the ground on the support of its legs, and\nwalk with the body above the legs, and not in contact with the ground,\nin order to be termed a walker; while a creeper is one that, regardless\nof its legs, if it has them, drags its body upon the ground. Upon\nhearing the judge’s decision, I yielded at once to my opponent.\n\nAt another time, when I was engaged in a similar discussion with my\nbrother Chatanna, Oesedah came to my rescue. Our grandmother had asked\nus:\n\n“What bird shows most judgment in caring for its young?”\n\nChatanna at once exclaimed:\n\n“The eagle!” but I held my peace for a moment, because I was\nconfused--so many birds came into my mind at once. I finally declared:\n\n“It is the oriole!”\n\nChatanna was asked to state all the evidence that he had in support of\nthe eagle’s good sense in rearing its young. He proceeded with an air of\nconfidence:\n\n“The eagle is the wisest of all birds. Its nest is made in the safest\npossible place, upon a high and inaccessible cliff. It provides its\nyoung with an abundance of fresh meat. They have the freshest of air.\nThey are brought up under the spell of the grandest scenes, and inspired\nwith lofty feelings and bravery. They see that all other beings live\nbeneath them, and that they are the children of the King of Birds. A\nyoung eagle shows the spirit of a warrior while still in the nest.\n\n“Being exposed to the inclemency of the weather the young eaglets are\nhardy. They are accustomed to hear the mutterings of the Thunder Bird\nand the sighings of the Great Mystery. Why, the little eagles cannot\nhelp being as noble as they are, because their parents selected for them\nso lofty and inspiring a home! How happy they must be when they find\nthemselves above the clouds, and behold the zigzag flashes of lightning\nall about them! It must be nice to taste a piece of fresh meat up in\ntheir cool home, in the burning summer-time! Then when they drop down\nthe bones of the game they feed upon, wolves and vultures gather beneath\nthem, feeding upon their refuse. That alone would show them their\nchieftainship over all the other birds. Isn’t that so, grandmother?”\n Thus triumphantly he concluded his argument.\n\nI was staggered at first by the noble speech of Chatannna, but I soon\nrecovered from its effects. The little Oesedah came to my aid by saying:\n“Wait until Ohiyesa tells of the loveliness of the beautiful Oriole’s\nhome!” This timely remark gave me courage and I began:\n\n“My grandmother, who was it said that a mother who has a gentle and\nsweet voice will have children of a good disposition? I think the oriole\nis that kind of a parent. It provides both sunshine and shadow for\nits young. Its nest is suspended from the prettiest bough of the most\ngraceful tree, where it is rocked by the gentle winds; and the one we\nfound yesterday was beautifully lined with soft things, both deep and\nwarm, so that the little featherless birdies cannot suffer from the cold\nand wet.”\n\nHere Chatanna interrupted me to exclaim: “That is just like the white\npeople--who cares for them? The eagle teaches its young to be accustomed\nto hardships, like young warriors!”\n\nOhiyesa was provoked; he reproached his brother and appealed to the\njudge, saying that he had not finished yet.\n\n“But you would not have lived, Chatanna, if you had been exposed like\nthat when you were a baby! The oriole shows wisdom in providing for its\nchildren a good, comfortable home! A home upon a high rock would not be\npleasant-it would be cold! We climbed a mountain once, and it was cold\nthere; and who would care to stay in such a place when it storms? What\nwisdom is there in having a pile of rough sticks upon a bare rock,\nsurrounded with ill-smelling bones of animals, for a home? Also,\nmy uncle says that the eaglets seem always to be on the point of\nstarvation. You have heard that whoever lives on game killed by some one\nelse is compared to an eagle. Isn’t that so, grandmother?\n\n“The oriole suspends its nest from the lower side of a horizontal\nbough so that no enemy can approach it. It enjoys peace and beauty and\nsafety.”\n\nOesedah was at Ohiyesa’s side during the discussion, and occasionally\nwhispered into his ear. Uncheedah decided this time in favor of Ohiyesa.\n\nWe were once very short of provisions in the winter time. My uncle, our\nonly means of support, was sick; and besides, we were separated from\nthe rest of the tribe and in a region where there was little game of any\nkind. Oesedah had a pet squirrel, and as soon as we began to economize\nour food had given portions of her allowance to her pet.\n\nAt last we were reduced very much, and the prospect of obtaining\nanything soon being gloomy, my grandmother reluctantly suggested that\nthe squirrel should be killed for food. Thereupon my little cousin\ncried, and said:\n\n“Why cannot we all die alike wanting? The squirrel’s life is as dear to\nhim as ours to us,” and clung to it. Fortunately, relief came in time to\nsave her pet.\n\nOesedah lived with us for a portion of the year, and as there were no\nother girls in the family she played much alone, and had many imaginary\ncompanions. At one time there was a small willow tree which she visited\nregularly, holding long conversations, a part of which she would\nafterward repeat to me. She said the willow tree was her husband, whom\nsome magic had compelled to take that form; but no grown person was ever\nallowed to share her secret.\n\nWhen I was about eight years old I had for a playmate the adopted son of\na Sioux, who was a white captive. This boy was quite a noted personage,\nalthough he was then only about ten or eleven years of age. When I\nfirst became acquainted with him we were on the upper Missouri river. I\nlearned from him that he had been taken on the plains, and that both of\nhis parents were killed.\n\nHe was at first sad and lonely, but soon found plenty of\nconsolation in his new home. The name of his adopted father was\n“Keeps-the-Spotted-Ponies.” He was known to have an unusual number of the\npretty calico ponies; indeed, he had a passion for accumulating property\nin the shape of ponies, painted tents, decorated saddles and all sorts\nof finery. He had lost his only son; but the little pale-face became the\nadopted brother of two handsome young women, his daughters. This made\nhim quite popular among the young warriors. He was not slow to adopt the\nIndian customs, and he acquired the Sioux language in a short time.\n\nI well remember hearing of his first experience of war. He was not more\nthan sixteen when he joined a war-party against the Gros-Ventres and\nMandans. My uncle reported that he was very brave until he was wounded\nin the ankle; then he begged with tears to be taken back to a safe\nplace. Fortunately for him, his adopted father came to the rescue, and\nsaved him at the risk of his own life. He was called the “pale-face\nIndian.” His hair grew very long and he lavished paint on his face and\nhair so that no one might suspect that he was a white man.\n\nOne day this boy was playing a gambling game with one of the Sioux\nwarriors. He was an expert gambler, and won everything from the Indian.\nAt a certain point a dispute arose. The Indian was very angry, for\nhe discovered that his fellow-player had deliberately cheated him. The\nIndians were strictly honest in those days, even in their gambling.\n\nThe boy declared that he had merely performed a trick for the benefit of\nhis friend, but it nearly cost him his life. The indignant warrior had\nalready drawn his bow-string with the intention of shooting the captive,\nbut a third person intervened and saved the boy’s life. He at once\nexplained his trick; and in order to show himself an honorable gambler,\ngave back all the articles that he had won from his opponent. In the\nmidst of the confusion, old “Keeps-the-Spotted-Ponies” came rushing\nthrough the crowd in a state of great excitement. He thought his\npale-face son had been killed. When he saw how matters stood, he gave\nthe aggrieved warrior a pony, “in order,” as he said, “that there may be\nno shadow between him and my son.”\n\nOne spring my uncle took Chatanna to the Canadian trading-post on the\nAssiniboine river, where he went to trade off his furs for ammunition\nand other commodities. When he came back, my brother was not with him!\n\nAt first my fears were even worse than the reality. The facts were\nthese: A Canadian with whom my uncle had traded much had six daughters\nand no son; and when he saw this handsome and intelligent little fellow,\nhe at once offered to adopt him.\n\n“I have no boy in my family,” said he, “and I will deal with him as with\na son. I am always in these regions trading; so you can see him two or\nthree times in a year.”\n\nHe further assured my uncle that the possession of the boy would greatly\nstrengthen their friendship. The matter was finally agreed upon. At\nfirst Chatanna was unwilling, but as we were taught to follow the advice\nof our parents and guardians, he was obliged to yield.\n\nThis was a severe blow to me, and for a long time I could not be\nconsoled. Uncheedah was fully in sympathy with my distress. She argued\nthat the white man’s education was not desirable for her boys; in fact,\nshe urged her son so strongly to go back after Chatanna that he promised\non his next visit to the post to bring him home again.\n\nBut the trader was a shrewd man. He immediately moved to another part of\nthe country; and I never saw my Chatanna, the companion of my childhood,\nagain! We learned afterward that he grew up and was married; but one day\nhe lost his way in a blizzard and was frozen to death.\n\nMy little cousin and I went to school together in later years; but she\ncould not endure the confinement of the school-room. Although apparently\nvery happy, she suffered greatly from the change to an indoor life, as\nhave many of our people, and died six months after our return to the\nUnited States.\n\n\n\n\nIII: The Boy Hunter\n\nIT will be no exaggeration to say that the life of the Indian hunter was\na life of fascination. From the moment that he lost sight of his rude\nhome in the midst of the forest, his untutored mind lost itself in the\nmyriad beauties and forces of nature. Yet he never forgot his personal\ndanger from some lurking foe or savage beast, however absorbing was his\npassion for the chase.\n\nThe Indian youth was a born hunter. Every motion, every step expressed\nan inborn dignity and, at the same time, a depth of native caution.\nHis moccasined foot fell like the velvet paw of a cat--noiselessly; his\nglittering black eyes scanned every object that appeared within their\nview. Not a bird, not even a chipmunk, escaped their piercing glance.\n\nI was scarcely over three years old when I stood one morning just\noutside our buffalo-skin teepee, with my little bow and arrows in my\nhand, and gazed up among the trees. Suddenly the instinct to chase and\nkill seized me powerfully. Just then a bird flew over my head and then\nanother caught my eye, as it balanced itself upon a swaying bough.\nEverything else was forgotten and in that moment I had taken my first\nstep as a hunter.\n\nThere was almost as much difference between the Indian boys who were\nbrought up on the open prairies and those of the woods, as between city\nand country boys. The hunting of the prairie boys was limited and their\nknowledge of natural history imperfect. They were, as a rule, good\nriders, but in all-round physical development much inferior to the red\nmen of the forest.\n\nOur hunting varied with the season of the year, and the nature of the\ncountry which was for the time our home. Our chief weapon was the bow\nand arrows, and perhaps, if we were lucky, a knife was possessed by some\none in the crowd. In the olden times, knives and hatchets were made from\nbone and sharp stones.\n\nFor fire we used a flint with a spongy piece of dry wood and a stone to\nstrike with. Another way of starting fire was for several of the boys\nto sit down in a circle and rub two pieces of dry, spongy wood together,\none after another, until the wood took fire.\n\nWe hunted in company a great deal, though it was a common thing for a\nboy to set out for the woods quite alone, and he usually enjoyed himself\nfully as much. Our game consisted mainly of small birds, rabbits,\nsquirrels and grouse. Fishing, too, occupied much of our time. We hardly\never passed a creek or a pond without searching for some signs of fish.\nWhen fish were present, we always managed to get some. Fish-lines were\nmade of wild hemp, sinew or horse-hair. We either caught fish with\nlines, snared or speared them, or shot them with bow and arrows. In the\nfall we charmed them up to the surface by gently tickling them with a\nstick and quickly threw them out. We have sometimes dammed the brooks\nand driven the larger fish into a willow basket made for that purpose.\n\nIt was part of our hunting to find new and strange things in the woods.\nWe examined the slightest sign of life; and if a bird had scratched the\nleaves off the ground, or a bear dragged up a root for his morning meal,\nwe stopped to speculate on the time it was done. If we saw a large old\ntree with some scratches on its bark, we concluded that a bear or some\nraccoons must be living there. In that case we did not go any nearer\nthan was necessary, but later reported the incident at home. An old\ndeer-track would at once bring on a warm discussion as to whether it was\nthe track of a buck or a doe. Generally, at noon, we met and compared\nour game, noting at the same time the peculiar characteristics of\neverything we had killed. It was not merely a hunt, for we combined with\nit the study of animal life. We also kept strict account of our game,\nand thus learned who were the best shots among the boys.\n\nI am sorry to say that we were merciless toward the birds. We often took\ntheir eggs and their young ones. My brother Chatanna and I once had a\ndisagreeable adventure while bird-hunting. We were accustomed to catch\nin our hands young ducks and geese during the summer, and while doing\nthis we happened to find a crane’s nest. Of course, we were delighted\nwith our good luck. But, as it was already midsummer, the young\ncranes--two in number--were rather large and they were a little way\nfrom the nest; we also observed that the two old cranes were in a swampy\nplace near by; but, as it was moulting-time, we did not suppose that\nthey would venture on dry land. So we proceeded to chase the young\nbirds; but they were fleet runners and it took us some time to come up\nwith them.\n\nMeanwhile, the parent birds had heard the cries of their little ones and\ncome to their rescue. They were chasing us, while we followed the birds.\nIt was really a perilous encounter! Our strong bows finally gained the\nvictory in a hand-to-hand struggle with the angry cranes; but after\nthat we hardly ever hunted a crane’s nest. Almost all birds make some\nresistance when their eggs or young are taken, but they will seldom\nattack man fearlessly.\n\nWe used to climb large trees for birds of all kinds; but we never\nundertook to get young owls unless they were on the ground. The hooting\nowl especially is a dangerous bird to attack under these circumstances.\nI was once trying to catch a yellow-winged woodpecker in its nest when\nmy arm became twisted and lodged in the deep hole so that I could not\nget it out without the aid of a knife; but we were a long way from home\nand my only companion was a deaf mute cousin of mine. I was about fifty\nfeet up in the tree, in a very uncomfortable position, but I had to wait\nthere for more than an hour before he brought me the knife with which I\nfinally released myself.\n\nOur devices for trapping small animals were rude, but they were often\nsuccessful. For instance, we used to gather up a peck or so of large,\nsharp-pointed burrs and scatter them in the rabbit’s furrow-like path.\nIn the morning, we would find the little fellow sitting quietly in his\ntracks, unable to move, for the burrs stuck to his feet.\n\nAnother way of snaring rabbits and grouse was the following: We made\nnooses of twisted horsehair, which we tied very firmly to the top of a\nlimber young tree, then bent the latter down to the track and fastened\nthe whole with a slip-knot, after adjusting the noose. When the rabbit\nruns his head through the noose, he pulls the slip-knot and is quickly\ncarried up by the spring of the young tree. This is a good plan, for the\nrabbit is out of harm’s way as he swings high in the air.\n\nPerhaps the most enjoyable of all was the chipmunk hunt. We killed these\nanimals at any time of year, but the special time to hunt them was in\nMarch. After the first thaw, the chipmunks burrow a hole through the\nsnow crust and make their first appearance for the season. Sometimes\nas many as fifty will come together and hold a social reunion. These\ngatherings occur early in the morning, from daybreak to about nine\no’clock.\n\nWe boys learned this, among other secrets of nature, and got our\nblunt-headed arrows together in good season for the chipmunk expedition.\n\nWe generally went in groups of six to a dozen or fifteen, to see which\nwould get the most. On the evening before, we selected several boys who\ncould imitate the chipmunk’s call with wild oatstraws and each of these\nprovided himself with a supply of straws.\n\nThe crust will hold the boys nicely at this time of the year. Bright and\nearly, they all come together at the appointed place, from which each\ngroup starts out in a different direction, agreeing to meet somewhere at\na given position of the sun.\n\nMy first experience of this kind is still well remembered. It was a fine\ncrisp March morning, and the sun had not yet shown himself among\nthe distant tree-tops as we hurried along through the ghostly wood.\nPresently we arrived at a place where there were many signs of the\nanimals. Then each of us selected a tree and took up his position behind\nit. The chipmunk caller sat upon a log as motionless as he could, and\nbegan to call.\n\nSoon we heard the patter of little feet on the hard snow; then we saw\nthe chipmunks approaching from all directions. Some stopped and\nran experimentally up a tree or a log, as if uncertain of the exact\ndirection of the call; others chased one another about.\n\nIn a few minutes, the chipmunk-caller was besieged with them. Some ran\nall over his person, others under him and still others ran up the tree\nagainst which he was sitting. Each boy remained immovable until their\nleader gave the signal; then a great shout arose, and the chipmunks in\ntheir flight all ran up the different trees.\n\nNow the shooting-match began. The little creatures seemed to realize\ntheir hopeless position; they would try again and again to come down\nthe trees and flee away from the deadly aim of the youthful hunters.\nBut they were shot down very fast; and whenever several of them rushed\ntoward the ground, the little red-skin hugged the tree and yelled\nfrantically to scare them up again.\n\nEach boy shoots always against the trunk of the tree, so that the arrow\nmay bound back to him every time; otherwise, when he had shot away all\nof them, he would be helpless, and another, who had cleared his own\ntree, would come and take away his game, so there was warm competition.\nSometimes a desperate chipmunk would jump from the top of the tree in\norder to escape, which was considered a joke on the boy who lost it and\na triumph for the brave little animal. At last all were killed or gone,\nand then we went on to another place, keeping up the sport until the sun\ncame out and the chipmunks refused to answer the call.\n\nWhen we went out on the prairies we had a different and less lively kind\nof sport. We used to snare with horse-hair and bow-strings all the small\nground animals, including the prairie-dog. We both snared and shot them.\nOnce a little boy set a snare for one, and lay flat on the ground a\nlittle way from the hole, holding the end of the string. Presently he\nfelt something move and pulled in a huge rattlesnake; and to this day,\nhis name is “Caught-the-Rattlesnake.” Very often a boy got a new name\nin some such manner. At another time, we were playing in the woods and\nfound a fawn’s track. We followed and caught it while asleep; but in\nthe struggle to get away, it kicked one boy, who is still called\n“Kicked-by-the-Fawn.”\n\nIt became a necessary part of our education to learn to prepare a meal\nwhile out hunting. It is a fact that most Indians will eat the liver and\nsome other portions of large animals raw, but they do not eat fish or\nbirds uncooked. Neither will they eat a frog, or an eel. On our boyish\nhunts, we often went on until we found ourselves a long way from our\ncamp, when we would kindle a fire and roast a part of our game.\n\nGenerally we broiled our meat over the coals on a stick. We roasted some\nof it over the open fire. But the best way to cook fish and birds is in\nthe ashes, under a big fire. We take the fish fresh from the creek or\nlake, have a good fire on the sand, dig in the sandy ashes and bury it\ndeep. The same thing is done in case of a bird, only we wet the feathers\nfirst. When it is done, the scales or feathers and skin are stripped\noff whole, and the delicious meat retains all its juices and flavor. We\npulled it off as we ate, leaving the bones undisturbed.\n\nOur people had also a method of boiling without pots or kettles. A large\npiece of tripe was thoroughly washed and the ends tied, then suspended\nbetween four stakes driven into the ground and filled with cold water.\nThe meat was then placed in this novel receptacle and boiled by means of\nthe addition of red-hot stones.\n\nChatanna was a good hunter. He called the doe and fawn beautifully by\nusing a thin leaf of birchbark between two flattened sticks. One morning\nwe found the tracks of a doe and fawn who had passed within the hour,\nfor the light dew was brushed from the grass.\n\n“What shall we do?” I asked. “Shall we go back to the teepee and tell\nuncle to bring his gun?”\n\n“No, no!” exclaimed Chatanna. “Did not our people kill deer and buffalo\nlong ago without guns? We will entice her into this open space, and,\nwhile she stands bewildered, I can throw my lasso line over her head.”\n\nHe had called only a few seconds when the fawn emerged from the thick\nwoods and stood before us, prettier than a picture. Then I uttered the\ncall, and she threw her tobacco-leaf-like ears toward me, while Chatanna\nthrew his lasso. She gave one scream and launched forth into the air,\nalmost throwing the boy hunter to the ground. Again and again she flung\nherself desperately into the air, but at last we led her to the nearest\ntree and tied her securely.\n\n“Now,” said he, “go and get our pets and see what they will do.”\n\nAt that time he had a good-sized black bear partly tamed, while I had\na young red fox and my faithful Ohitika or Brave. I untied Chagoo, the\nbear, and Wanahon, the fox, while Ohitika got up and welcomed me by\nwagging his tail in a dignified way.\n\n“Come,” I said, “all three of you. I think we have something you would\nall like to see.”\n\nThey seemed to understand me, for Chagoo began to pull his rope with\nboth paws, while Wanahon undertook the task of digging up by the roots\nthe sapling to which I had tied him.\n\nBefore we got to the open spot, we already heard Ohitika’s joyous bark,\nand the two wild pets began to run, and pulled me along through the\nunderbrush. Chagoo soon assumed the utmost precaution and walked as if\nhe had splinters in his soles, while Wanahon kept his nose down low and\nsneaked through the trees.\n\nOut into the open glade we came, and there, before the three rogues,\nstood the little innocent fawn. She visibly trembled at the sight of the\nmotley group. The two human rogues looked to her, I presume, just as bad\nas the other three. Chagoo regarded her with a mixture of curiosity\nand defiance, while Wanahon stood as if rooted to the ground, evidently\nplanning how to get at her. But Ohitika (Brave), generous Ohitika,\nhis occasional barking was only in jest. He did not care to touch the\nhelpless thing.\n\nSuddenly the fawn sprang high into the air and then dropped her pretty\nhead on the ground.\n\n“Ohiyesa, the fawn is dead,” cried Chatanna. “I wanted to keep her.”\n\n“It is a shame;” I chimed in.\n\nWe five guilty ones came and stood around her helpless form. We all\nlooked very sorry; even Chagoo’s eyes showed repentance and regret.\nAs for Ohitika, he gave two great sighs and then betook himself to a\nrespectful distance. Chatanna had two big tears gradually swamping his\nlong, black eye-lashes; and I thought it was time to hide my face, for I\ndid not want him to look at me.\n\n\n\n\nIV. Hakadah’s First Offering\n\n“HAKADAH, coowah!” was the sonorous call that came from a large teepee\nin the midst of the Indian encampment. In answer to the summons there\nemerged from the woods, which were only a few steps away, a boy,\naccompanied by a splendid black dog. There was little in the appearance\nof the little fellow to distinguish him from the other Sioux boys.\n\nHe hastened to the tent from which he had been summoned, carrying in\nhis hands a bow and arrows gorgeously painted, while the small birds and\nsquirrels that he had killed with these weapons dangled from his belt.\n\nWithin the tent sat two old women, one on each side of the fire.\nUncheedah was the boy’s grandmother, who had brought up the motherless\nchild. Wahchewin was only a caller, but she had been invited to remain\nand assist in the first personal offering of Hakadah to the “Great\nMystery.”\n\nThis was a matter which had, for several days, pretty much monopolized\nUncheedah’s mind. It was her custom to see to this when each of her\nchildren attained the age of eight summers. They had all been celebrated\nas warriors and hunters among their tribe, and she had not hesitated to\nclaim for herself a good share of the honors they had achieved, because\nshe had brought them early to the notice of the “Great Mystery.”\n\nShe believed that her influence had helped to regulate and develop the\ncharacters of her sons to the height of savage nobility and strength of\nmanhood.\n\nIt had been whispered through the teepee village that Uncheedah intended\nto give a feast in honor of her grandchild’s first sacrificial offering.\nThis was mere speculation, however, for the clearsighted old woman had\ndetermined to keep this part of the matter secret until the offering\nshould be completed, believing that the “Great Mystery” should be met in\nsilence and dignity.\n\nThe boy came rushing into the lodge, followed by his dog Ohitika who was\nwagging his tail promiscuously, as if to say: “Master and I are really\nhunters!”\n\nHakadah breathlessly gave a descriptive narrative of the killing of each\nbird and squirrel as he pulled them off his belt and threw them before\nhis grandmother.\n\n“This blunt-headed arrow,” said he, “actually had eyes this morning.\nBefore the squirrel can dodge around the tree it strikes him in the\nhead, and, as he falls to the ground, my Ohitika is upon him.”\n\nHe knelt upon one knee as he talked, his black eyes shining like evening\nstars.\n\n“Sit down here,” said Uncheedah to the boy; “I have something to say to\nyou. You see that you are now almost a man. Observe the game you have\nbrought me! It will not be long before you will leave me, for a warrior\nmust seek opportunities to make him great among his people.\n\n“You must endeavor to equal your father and grandfather,” she went on.\n“They were warriors and feast-makers. But it is not the poor hunter who\nmakes many feasts. Do you not remember the ‘Legend of the Feast-Maker,’\nwho gave forty feasts in twelve moons? And have you forgotten the story\nof the warrior who sought the will of the Great Mystery? To-day you will\nmake your first offering to him.”\n\nThe concluding sentence fairly dilated the eyes of the young hunter, for\nhe felt that a great event was about to occur, in which he would be the\nprincipal actor. But Uncheedah resumed her speech.\n\n“You must give up one of your belongings-whichever is dearest to\nyou--for this is to be a sacrificial offering.”\n\nThis somewhat confused the boy; not that he was selfish, but rather\nuncertain as to what would be the most appropriate thing to give. Then,\ntoo, he supposed that his grandmother referred to his ornaments and\nplaythings only. So he volunteered:\n\n“I can give up my best bow and arrows, and all the paints I have,\nand--and my bear’s claws necklace, grandmother!”\n\n“Are these the things dearest to you?” she demanded.\n\n“Not the bow and arrows, but the paints will be very hard to get, for\nthere are no white people near; and the necklace--it is not easy to get\none like it again. I will also give up my otterskin head-dress, if you\nthink that is not enough.”\n\n“But think, my boy, you have not yet mentioned the thing that will be a\npleasant offering to the Great Mystery.”\n\nThe boy looked into the woman’s face with a puzzled expression.\n\n“I have nothing else as good as those things I have named, grandmother,\nunless it is my spotted pony; and I am sure that the Great Mystery will\nnot require a little boy to make him so large a gift. Besides, my uncle\ngave three otter-skins and five eagle-feathers for him and I promised to\nkeep him a long while, if the Blackfeet or the Crows do not steal him.”\n\nUncheedah was not fully satisfied with the boy’s free offerings. Perhaps\nit had not occurred to him what she really wanted. But Uncheedah\nknew where his affection was vested. His faithful dog, his pet and\ncompanion--Hakadah was almost inseparable from the loving beast.\n\nShe was sure that it would be difficult to obtain his consent to\nsacrifice the animal, but she ventured upon a final appeal.\n\n“You must remember,” she said, “that in this offering you will call\nupon him who looks at you from every creation. In the wind you hear him\nwhisper to you. He gives his war-whoop in the thunder. He watches you\nby day with his eye, the sun; at night, he gazes upon your sleeping\ncountenance through the moon. In short, it is the Mystery of Mysteries,\nwho controls all things to whom you will make your first offering. By\nthis act, you will ask him to grant to you what he has granted to few\nmen. I know you wish to be a great warrior and hunter. I am not prepared\nto see my Hakadah show any cowardice, for the love of possessions is a\nwoman’s trait and not a brave’s.”\n\nDuring this speech, the boy had been completely aroused to the spirit\nof manliness, and in his excitement was willing to give up anything he\nhad--even his pony! But he was unmindful of his friend and companion,\nOhitika, the dog! So, scarcely had Uncheedah finished speaking, when he\nalmost shouted:\n\n“Grandmother, I will give up any of my possessions for the offering to\nthe Great Mystery! You may select what you think will be most pleasing\nto him.”\n\nThere were two silent spectators of this little dialogue. One was\nWahchewin; the other was Ohitika. The woman had been invited to stay,\nalthough only a neighbor. The dog, by force of habit, had taken up his\nusual position by the side of his master when they entered the teepee.\nWithout moving a muscle, save those of his eyes, he had been a very\nclose observer of what passed.\n\nHad the dog but moved once to attract the attention of his little\nfriend, he might have been dissuaded from that impetuous exclamation:\n“Grandmother, I will give up any of my possessions!”\n\nIt was hard for Uncheedah to tell the boy that he must part with his\ndog, but she was equal to the situation.\n\n“Hakadah,” she proceeded cautiously, “you are a young brave. I know,\nthough young, your heart is strong and your courage is great. You\nwill be pleased to give up the dearest thing you have for your first\noffering. You must give up Ohitika. He is brave; and you, too,\nare brave. He will not fear death; you will bear his loss bravely.\nCome--here are four bundles of paints and a filled pipe--let us go to\nthe place.”\n\nWhen the last words were uttered, Hakadah did not seem to hear them. He\nwas simply unable to speak. To a civilized eye, he would have appeared\nat that moment like a little copper statue. His bright black eyes were\nfast melting in floods of tears, when he caught his grandmother’s\neye and recollected her oft-repeated adage: “Tears for woman and the\nwar-whoop for man to drown sorrow!”\n\nHe swallowed two or three big mouthfuls of heart-ache and the little\nwarrior was master of the situation.\n\n“Grandmother, my Brave will have to die! Let me tie together two of the\nprettiest tails of the squirrels that he and I killed this morning, to\nshow to the Great Mystery what a hunter he has been. Let me paint him\nmyself.”\n\nThis request Uncheedah could not refuse and she left the pair alone for\na few minutes, while she went to ask Wacoota to execute Ohitika.\n\nEvery Indian boy knows that, when a warrior is about to meet death, he\nmust sing a death dirge. Hakadah thought of his Ohitika as a person who\nwould meet his death without a struggle, so he began to sing a dirge\nfor him, at the same time hugging him tight to himself. As if he were a\nhuman being, he whispered in his ear:\n\n“Be brave, my Ohitika! I shall remember you the first time I am upon the\nwar-path in the Ojibway country.”\n\nAt last he heard Uncheedah talking with a man outside the teepee, so he\nquickly took up his paints. Ohitika was a jet-black dog, with a silver\ntip on the end of his tail and on his nose, beside one white paw and a\nwhite star upon a protuberance between his ears. Hakadah knew that a\nman who prepares for death usually paints with red and black. Nature\nhad partially provided Ohitika in this respect, so that only red was\nrequired and this Hakadah supplied generously.\n\nThen he took off a piece of red cloth and tied it around the dog’s neck;\nto this he fastened two of the squirrels’ tails and a wing from the\noriole they had killed that morning.\n\nJust then it occurred to him that good warriors always mourn for their\ndeparted friends and the usual mourning was black paint. He loosened his\nblack braided locks, ground a dead coal, mixed it with bear’s oil and\nrubbed it on his entire face.\n\nDuring this time every hole in the tent was occupied with an eye. Among\nthe lookers-on was his grandmother. She was very near relenting. Had she\nnot feared the wrath of the Great Mystery, she would have been happy to\ncall out to the boy: “Keep your dear dog, my child!”\n\nAs it was, Hakadah came out of the teepee with his face looking like an\neclipsed moon, leading his beautiful dog, who was even handsomer than\never with the red touches on his specks of white.\n\nIt was now Uncheedah’s turn to struggle with the storm and burden in\nher soul. But the boy was emboldened by the people’s admiration of his\nbravery, and did not shed a tear. As soon as she was able to speak, the\nloving grandmother said:\n\n“No, my young brave, not so! You must not mourn for your first offering.\nWash your face and then we will go.”\n\nThe boy obeyed, submitted Ohitika to Wacoota with a smile, and walked\noff with his grandmother and Wahchewin.\n\nThey followed a well-beaten foot-path leading along the bank of the\nAssiniboine river, through a beautiful grove of oak, and finally around\nand under a very high cliff. The murmuring of the river came up from\njust below. On the opposite side was a perpendicular white cliff, from\nwhich extended back a gradual slope of land, clothed with the majestic\nmountain oak. The scene was impressive and wild.\n\nWahchewin had paused without a word when the little party reached the\nedge of the cliff. It had been arranged between her and Uncheedah that\nshe should wait there for Wacoota, who was to bring as far as that the\nportion of the offering with which he had been entrusted.\n\nThe boy and his grandmother descended the bank, following a tortuous\nfoot-path until they reached the water’s edge. Then they proceeded to\nthe mouth of an immense cave, some fifty feet above the river, under\nthe cliff. A little stream of limpid water trickled down from a spring\nwithin the cave. The little watercourse served as a sort of natural\nstaircase for the visitors. A cool, pleasant atmosphere exhaled from\nthe mouth of the cavern. Really it was a shrine of nature and it is not\nstrange that it was so regarded by the tribe.\n\nA feeling of awe and reverence came to the boy. “It is the home of the\nGreat Mystery,” he thought to himself; and the impressiveness of his\nsurroundings made him forget his sorrow.\n\nVery soon Wahchewin came with some difficulty to the steps. She placed\nthe body of Ohitika upon the ground in a life-like position and again\nleft the two alone.\n\nAs soon as she disappeared from view, Uncheedah, with all solemnity\nand reverence, unfastened the leather strings that held the four small\nbundles of paints and one of tobacco, while the filled pipe was laid\nbeside the dead Ohitika.\n\nShe scattered paints and tobacco all about. Again they stood a few\nmoments silently; then she drew a deep breath and began her prayer to\nthe Great Mystery:\n\n“O, Great Mystery, we hear thy voice in the rushing waters below us! We\nhear thy whisper in the great oaks above! Our spirits are refreshed with\nthy breath from within this cave. O, hear our prayer! Behold this little\nboy and bless him! Make him a warrior and a hunter as great as thou\ndidst make his father and grandfather.”\n\nAnd with this prayer the little warrior had completed his first\noffering.\n\n\n\n\nV. FAMILY TRADITIONS\n\n\n\n\nI: A Visit to Smoky Day\n\nSMOKY DAY was widely known among us as a preserver of history and\nlegend. He was a living book of the traditions and history of his\npeople. Among his effects were bundles of small sticks, notched and\npainted. One bundle contained the number of his own years. Another was\ncomposed of sticks representing the important events of history, each\nof which was marked with the number of years since that particular event\noccurred. For instance, there was the year when so many stars fell from\nthe sky, with the number of years since it happened cut into the wood.\nAnother recorded the appearance of a comet; and from these heavenly\nwonders the great national catastrophes and victories were reckoned.\n\nBut I will try to repeat some of his favorite narratives as I heard them\nfrom his own lips. I went to him one day with a piece of tobacco and\nan eagle-feather; not to buy his MSS., but hoping for the privilege\nof hearing him tell of some of the brave deeds of our people in remote\ntimes.\n\nThe tall and large old man greeted me with his usual courtesy and\nthanked me for my present. As I recall the meeting, I well remember his\nunusual stature, his slow speech and gracious manner.\n\n“Ah, Ohiyesa!” said he, “my young warrior--for such you will be some\nday! I know this by your seeking to hear of the great deeds of your\nancestors. That is a good sign, and I love to repeat these stories to\none who is destined to be a brave man. I do not wish to lull you\nto sleep with sweet words; but I know the conduct of your paternal\nancestors. They have been and are still among the bravest of our\ntribe. To prove this, I will relate what happened in your paternal\ngrandfather’s family, twenty years ago.\n\n“Two of his brothers were murdered by a jealous young man of their\nown band. The deed was committed without just cause; therefore all\nthe braves were agreed to punish the murderer with death. When your\ngrandfather was approached with this suggestion, he replied that he and\nthe remaining brothers could not condescend to spill the blood of such a\nwretch, but that the others might do whatever they thought just with the\nyoung man. These men were foremost among the warriors of the Sioux, and\nno one questioned their courage; yet when this calamity was brought upon\nthem by a villain, they refused to touch him! This, my boy, is a test of\ntrue bravery. Self-possession and self-control at such a moment is proof\nof a strong heart.\n\n“You have heard of Jingling Thunder the elder, whose brave deeds are\nwell known to the Villagers of the Lakes. He sought honor ‘in the gates\nof the enemy,’ as we often say. The Great Mystery was especially kind to\nhim, because he was obedient.\n\n“Many winters ago there was a great battle, in which Jingling Thunder\nwon his first honors. It was forty winters before the falling of many\nstars, which event occurred twenty winters after the coming of the\nblack-robed white priest; and that was fourteen winters before the\nannihilation by our people of thirty lodges of the Sac and Fox Indians.\nI well remember the latter event--it was just fifty winters ago.\nHowever, I will count my sticks again.”\n\nSo saying, Smoky Day produced his bundle of variously colored sticks,\nabout five inches long. He counted and gave them to me to verify his\ncalculation.\n\n“But you,” he resumed, “do not care to remember the winters that have\npassed. You are young, and care only for the event and the deed. It was\nvery many years ago that this thing happened that I am about to tell\nyou, and yet our people speak of it with as much enthusiasm as if it\nwere only yesterday. Our heroes are always kept alive in the minds of\nthe nation.\n\n“Our people lived then on the east bank of the Mississippi, a little\nsouth of where Imnejah-skah, or White Cliff (St. Paul, Minnesota), now\nstands. After they left Mille Lacs they founded several villages,\nbut finally settled in this spot, whence the tribes have gradually\ndispersed. Here a battle occurred which surpassed all others in history.\nIt lasted one whole day--the Sacs and Foxes and the Dakotas against the\nOjibways.\n\n“An invitation in the usual form of a filled pipe was brought to the\nSioux by a brave of the Sac and Fox tribe, to make a general attack\nupon their common enemy. The Dakota braves quickly signified their\nwillingness in the same manner, and it having been agreed to meet upon\nthe St. Croix river, preparations were immediately begun to despatch a\nlarge war-party.\n\n“Among our people there were many tried warriors whose names were known,\nand every youth of a suitable age was desirous of emulating them. As\nthese young novices issued from every camp and almost every teepee,\ntheir mothers, sisters, grandfathers and grandmothers were singing\nfor them the ‘strong-heart’ songs. An old woman, living with her only\ngrandchild, the remnant of a once large band who had all been killed\nat three different times by different parties of the Ojibways, was\nconspicuous among the singers.\n\n“Everyone who heard, cast toward her a sympathetic glance, for it was\nwell known that she and her grandson constituted the remnant of a\nband of Sioux, and that her song indicated that her precious child had\nattained the age of a warrior, and was now about to join the war-party,\nand to seek a just revenge for the annihilation of his family. This was\nJingling Thunder, also familiarly known as ‘The Little Last.’ He was\nseen to carry with him some family relics in the shape of war-clubs and\nlances.\n\n“The aged woman’s song was something like this:\n\n    “Go, my brave Jingling Thunder!\n    Upon the silvery path\n    Behold that glittering track--\n\n    “And yet, my child, remember\n    How pitiful to live\n    Survivor of the young!\n    ‘Stablish our name and kin!”\n\n\n“The Sacs and Foxes were very daring and confident upon this occasion.\nThey proposed to the Sioux that they should engage alone with the enemy\nat first, and let us see how their braves can fight! To this our people\nassented, and they assembled upon the hills to watch the struggle\nbetween their allies and the Ojibways. It seemed to be an equal fight,\nand for a time no one could tell how the contest would end. Young\nJingling Thunder was an impatient spectator, and it was The Milky\nWay--believed by the Dakotas to be the road travelled by the spirits of\ndeparted braves hard to keep him from rushing forward to meet his foes.\n\n“At last a great shout went up, and the Sacs and Foxes were seen to be\nretreating with heavy loss. Then the Sioux took the field, and were fast\nwinning the day, when fresh reinforcements came from the north for the\nOjibways. Up to this time Jingling Thunder had been among the foremost\nin the battle, and had engaged in several close encounters. But this\nfresh attack of the Ojibways was unexpected, and the Sioux were somewhat\ntired. Besides, they had told the Sacs and Foxes to sit upon the hills\nand rest their weary limbs and take lessons from their friends the\nSioux; therefore no aid was looked for from any quarter.\n\n“A great Ojibway chief made a fierce onslaught on the Dakotas. This\nman Jingling Thunder now rushed forward to meet. The Ojibway boastfully\nshouted to his warriors that he had met a tender fawn and would reserve\nto himself the honor of destroying it. Jingling Thunder, on his side,\nexclaimed that he had met the aged bear of whom he had heard so much,\nbut that he would need no assistance to overcome him.\n\n“The powerful man flashed his tomahawk in the air over the youthful\nwarrior’s head, but the brave sprang aside as quick as lightning, and\nin the same instant speared his enemy to the heart. As the Ojibway chief\ngave a gasping yell and fell in death, his people lost courage; while\nthe success of the brave Jingling Thunder strengthened the hearts of the\nSioux, for they immediately followed up their advantage and drove the\nenemy out of their territory.\n\n“This was the beginning of Jingling Thunder’s career as a warrior. He\nafterwards performed even greater acts of valor. He became the ancestor\nof a famous band of the Sioux, of whom your own father, Ohiyesa, was a\nmember. You have doubtless heard his name in connection with many great\nevents. Yet he was a patient man, and was never known to quarrel with\none of his own nation.”\n\nThat night I lay awake a long time committing to memory the tradition\nI had heard, and the next day I boasted to my playmate, Little Rainbow,\nabout my first lesson from the old storyteller. To this he replied:\n\n“I would rather have Weyuhah for my teacher. I think he remembers more\nthan any of the others. When Weyuhah tells about a battle you can see\nit yourself; you can even hear the war-whoop,” he went on with much\nenthusiasm.\n\n“That is what his friends say of him; but those who are not his friends\nsay that he brings many warriors into the battle who were not there,”\n I answered indignantly, for I could not admit that old Smoky Day could\nhave a rival.\n\nBefore I went to him again Uncheedah had thoughtfully prepared a nice\nvenison roast for the teacher, and I was proud to take him something\ngood to eat before beginning his story.\n\n“How,” was his greeting, “so you have begun already, Ohiyesa? Your\nfamily were ever feastmakers as well as warriors.”\n\nHaving done justice to the tender meat, he wiped his knife by sticking\nit into the ground several times, and put it away in its sheath, after\nwhich he cheerfully recommenced:\n\n“It came to pass not many winters ago that Wakinyan-tonka, the great\nmedicine man, had a vision; whereupon a war-party set out for the\nOjibway country. There were three brothers of your family among them,\nall of whom were noted for valor and the chase.\n\n“Seven battles were fought in succession before they turned to come\nback. They had secured a number of the enemy’s birch canoes, and the\nwhole party came floating down the Mississippi, joyous and happy because\nof their success.\n\n“But one night the war-chief announced that there was misfortune at\nhand. The next day no one was willing to lead the fleet. The youngest of\nthe three brothers finally declared that he did not fear death, for it\ncomes when least expected and he volunteered to take the lead.\n\n“It happened that this young man had left a pretty maiden behind him,\nwhose choice needlework adorned his quiver. He was very handsome as well\nas brave.\n\n“At daybreak the canoes were again launched upon the bosom of the great\nriver. All was quiet--a few birds beginning to sing. Just as the sun\npeeped through the eastern tree-tops a great warcry came forth from the\nnear shores, and there was a rain of arrows. The birchen canoes were\npierced, and in the excitement many were capsized.\n\n“The Sioux were at a disadvantage. There was no shelter. Their\nbow-strings and the feathers on their arrows were wet. The bold Ojibways\nsaw their advantage and pressed closer and closer; but our men fought\ndesperately, half in and half out of the water, until the enemy was\nforced at last to retreat. Nevertheless that was a sad day for the\nWahpeton Sioux; but saddest of all was Winona’s fate!\n\n“Morning Star, her lover, who led the canoe fleet that morning, was\namong the slain. For two days the Sioux braves searched in the water for\ntheir dead, but his body was not recovered.\n\n“At home, meanwhile, the people had been alarmed by ill omens. Winona,\neldest daughter of the great chief, one day entered her birch canoe\nalone and paddled up the Mississippi, gazing now into the water around\nher, now into the blue sky above. She thought she heard some young men\ngiving courtship calls in the distance, just as they do at night when\napproaching the teepee of the beloved; and she knew the voice of Morning\nStar well! Surely she could distinguish his call among the others!\nTherefore she listened yet more intently, and looked skyward as her\nlight canoe glided gently up stream.\n\n“Ah, poor Winona! She saw only six sandhill cranes, looking no larger\nthan mosquitoes, as they flew in circles high up in the sky, going east\nwhere all spirits go. Something said to her: ‘Those are the spirits\nof some of the Sioux braves, and Morning Star is among them!’ Her eye\nfollowed the birds as they traveled in a chain of circles.\n\n“Suddenly she glanced downward. ‘What is this?’ she screamed in despair.\nIt was Morning Star’s body, floating down the river; his quiver, worked\nby her own hands and now dyed with his blood, lay upon the surface of\nthe water.\n\n“‘Ah, Great Mystery! why do you punish a poor girl so? Let me go with\nthe spirit of Morning Star!’\n\n“It was evening. The pale moon arose in the east and the stars were\nbright. At this very hour the news of the disaster was brought home by\na returning scout, and the village was plunged in grief, but Winona’s\nspirit had flown away. No one ever saw her again.\n\n“This is enough for to-day, my boy. You may come again to-morrow.”\n\n\n\n\nII. The Stone Boy\n\n“Ho, mita koda!” (welcome, friend!) was Smoky Day’s greeting, as I\nentered his lodge on the third day. “I hope you did not dream of a\nwatery combat with the Ojibways, after the history I repeated to you\nyesterday,” the old sage continued, with a complaisant smile playing\nupon his face.\n\n“No,” I said, meekly, “but, on the other hand, I have wished that the\nsun might travel a little faster, so that I could come for another\nstory.”\n\n“Well, this time I will tell you one of the kind we call myths or fairy\nstories. They are about men and women who do wonderful things--things\nthat ordinary people cannot do at all. Sometimes they are not exactly\nhuman beings, for they partake of the nature of men and beasts, or of\nmen and gods. I tell you this beforehand, so that you may not ask any\nquestions, or be puzzled by the inconsistency of the actors in these old\nstories.\n\n“Once there were ten brothers who lived with their only sister, a young\nmaiden of sixteen summers. She was very skilful at her embroidery, and\nher brothers all had beautifully worked quivers and bows embossed with\nporcupine quills. They loved and were kind to her, and the maiden in\nher turn loved her brothers dearly, and was content with her position as\ntheir housekeeper. They were great hunters, and scarcely ever remained\nat home during the day, but when they returned at evening they would\nrelate to her all their adventures.\n\n“One night they came home one by one with their game, as usual, all but\nthe eldest, who did not return. It was supposed by the other brothers\nthat he had pursued a deer too far from the lodge, or perhaps shot more\ngame than he could well carry; but the sister had a presentiment that\nsomething dreadful had befallen him. She was partially consoled by the\nsecond brother, who offered to find the lost one in the morning.\n\n“Accordingly, he went in search of him, while the rest set out on the\nhunt as usual. Toward evening all had returned safely, save the brother\nwho went in search of the absent. Again, the next older brother went\nto look for the others, and he too returned no more. All the young men\ndisappeared one by one in this manner, leaving their sister alone.\n\n“The maiden’s sorrow was very great. She wandered everywhere, weeping\nand looking for her brothers, but found no trace of them. One day she\nwas walking beside a beautiful little stream, whose clear waters went\nlaughing and singing on their way. She could see the gleaming pebbles at\nthe bottom, and one in particular seemed so lovely to her tear-bedimmed\neyes, that she stooped and picked it up, dropping it within her skin\ngarment into her bosom. For the first time since her misfortunes she had\nforgotten herself and her sorrow.\n\n“At last she went home, much happier than she had been, though she could\nnot have told the reason why. On the following day she sought again the\nplace where she had found the pebble, and this time she fell asleep on\nthe banks of the stream, When she awoke, there lay a beautiful babe in\nher bosom.\n\n“She took it up and kissed it many times. And the child was a boy, but\nit was heavy like a stone, so she called him a ‘Little Stone Boy.’ The\nmaiden cried no more, for she was very happy with her baby. The child\nwas unusually knowing, and walked almost from its birth.\n\n“One day Stone Boy discovered the bow and arrows of one of his uncles,\nand desired to have them; but his mother cried, and said:\n\n“‘Wait, my son, until you are a young man.’ She made him some little\nones, and with these he soon learned to hunt, and killed small game\nenough to support them both. When he had grown to be a big boy, he\ninsisted upon knowing whose were the ten bows that still hung upon the\nwalls of his mother’s lodge.\n\n“At last she was obliged to tell him the sad story of her loss.\n\n“‘Mother, I shall go in search of my uncles,’ exclaimed the Stone Boy.\n\n“‘But you will be lost like them,’ she replied, ‘and then I shall die of\ngrief.’\n\n“‘No, I shall not be lost. I shall bring your ten brothers back to you.\nLook, I will give you a sign. I will take a pillow, and place it upon\nend. Watch this, for as long as I am living the pillow will stay as\nI put it. Mother, give me some food and some moccasins with which to\ntravel!’\n\n“Taking the bow of one of his uncles, with its quiver full of arrows,\nthe Stone Boy departed. As he journeyed through the forest he spoke to\nevery animal he met, asking for news of his lost uncles. Sometimes he\ncalled to them at the top of his voice. Once he thought he heard an\nanswer, so he walked in the direction of the sound. But it was only a\ngreat grizzly bear who had wantonly mimicked the boy’s call. Then Stone\nBoy was greatly provoked.\n\n“‘Was it you who answered my call, you longface?’ he exclaimed.\n\n“Upon this the latter growled and said:\n\n“‘You had better be careful how you address me, or you may be sorry for\nwhat you say!’\n\n“‘Who cares for you, you red-eyes, you ugly thing!’ the boy replied;\nwhereupon the grizzly immediately set upon him.\n\n“But the boy’s flesh became as hard as stone, and the bear’s great teeth\nand claws made no impression upon it. Then he was so dreadfully heavy;\nand he kept laughing all the time as if he were being tickled, which\ngreatly aggravated the bear. Finally Stone Boy pushed him aside and sent\nan arrow to his heart.\n\n“He walked on for some distance until he came to a huge fallen pine\ntree, which had evidently been killed by lightning. The ground near by\nbore marks of a struggle, and Stone Boy picked up several arrows exactly\nlike those of his uncles, which he himself carried.\n\n“While he was examining these things, he heard a sound like that of a\nwhirlwind, far up in the heavens. He looked up and saw a black speck\nwhich grew rapidly larger until it became a dense cloud. Out of it came\na flash and then a thunderbolt. The boy was obliged to wink; and when he\nopened his eyes, behold! a stately man stood before him and challenged\nhim to single combat.\n\n“Stone Boy accepted the challenge and they grappled with one another.\nThe man from the clouds was gigantic in stature and very powerful. But\nStone Boy was both strong and unnaturally heavy and hard to hold. The\ngreat warrior from the sky sweated from his exertions, and there came a\nheavy shower. Again and again the lightnings flashed about them as\nthe two struggled there. At last Stone Boy threw his opponent, who lay\nmotionless. There was a murmuring sound throughout the heavens and the\nclouds rolled swiftly away.\n\n“‘Now,’ thought the hero, ‘this man must have slain all my uncles. I\nshall go to his home and find out what has become of them.’ With this\nhe unfastened from the dead man’s scalp-lock a beautiful bit of scarlet\ndown. He breathed gently upon it, and as it floated upward he followed\ninto the blue heavens.\n\n“Away went Stone Boy to the country of the Thunder Birds. It was a\nbeautiful land, with lakes, rivers, plains and mountains. The young\nadventurer found himself looking down from the top of a high mountain,\nand the country appeared to be very populous, for he saw lodges all\nabout him as far as the eye could reach. He particularly noticed a\nmajestic tree which towered above all the others, and in its bushy top\nbore an enormous nest. Stone Boy descended from the mountain and soon\narrived at the foot of the tree; but there were no limbs except those\nat the top and it was so tall that he did not attempt to climb it. He\nsimply took out his bit of down, breathed upon it and floated gently\nupward.\n\n“When he was able to look into the nest he saw there innumerable eggs of\nvarious sizes, and all of a remarkable red color. He was nothing but a\nboy after all, and had all a boy’s curiosity and recklessness. As he\nwas handling the eggs carelessly, his notice was attracted to a sudden\nconfusion in the little village below. All of the people seemed to be\nrunning toward the tree. He mischievously threw an egg at them, and\nin the instant that it broke he saw one of the men drop dead. Then all\nbegan to cry out pitifully, ‘Give me my heart!’\n\n“‘Ah,’ exclaimed Stone Boy, exulting,’ so these are the hearts of the\npeople who destroyed my uncles! I shall break them all!’\n\n“And he really did break all of the eggs but four small ones which he\ntook in his hand. Then he descended the tree, and wandered among the\nsilent and deserted lodges in search of some trace of his lost uncles.\nHe found four little boys, the sole survivors of their race, and these\nhe commanded to tell him where their bones were laid.\n\n“They showed him the spot where a heap of bones was bleaching on the\nground. Then he bade one of the boys bring wood, a second water, a third\nstones, and the fourth he sent to cut willow wands for the sweat lodge.\nThey obeyed, and Stone Boy built the lodge, made a fire, heated the\nstones and collected within the lodge all the bones of his ten uncles.\n\n“As he poured the water upon the hot stones faint sounds could be heard\nfrom within the magic bath. These changed to the murmuring of voices,\nand finally to the singing of medicine songs. Stone Boy opened the door\nand his ten uncles came forth in the flesh, thanking him and blessing\nhim for restoring them to life. Only the little finger of the youngest\nuncle was missing. Stone Boy now heartlessly broke the four remaining\neggs, and took the little finger of the largest boy to supply the\nmissing bone.\n\n“They all returned to earth again and Stone Boy conducted his uncles to\nhis mother’s lodge. She had never slept during his entire absence, but\nwatched incessantly the pillow upon which her boy was wont to rest his\nhead, and by which she was to know of his safety. Going a little in\nadvance of the others, he suddenly rushed forward into her teepee,\nexclaiming: ‘Mother, your ten brothers are coming--prepare a feast!’\n\n“For some time after this they all lived happily together. Stone Boy\noccupied himself with solitary hunting. He was particularly fond of\nhunting the fiercer wild animals. He killed them wantonly and brought\nhome only the ears, teeth and claws as his spoil, and with these he\nplayed as he laughingly recounted his exploits. His mother and uncles\nprotested, and begged him at least to spare the lives of those animals\nheld sacred by the Dakotas, but Stone Boy relied upon his supernatural\npowers to protect him from harm.\n\n“One evening, however, he was noticeably silent and upon being pressed\nto give the reason, replied as follows:\n\n“‘For some days past I have heard the animals talking of a conspiracy\nagainst us. I was going west the other morning when I heard a crier\nannouncing a general war upon Stone Boy and his people. The crier was\na Buffalo, going at full speed from west to east. Again, I heard the\nBeaver conversing with the Musk-rat, and both said that their services\nwere already promised to overflow the lakes and rivers and cause a\ndestructive flood. I heard, also, the little Swallow holding a secret\ncouncil with all the birds of the air. He said that he had been\nappointed a messenger to the Thunder Birds, and that at a certain signal\nthe doors of the sky would be opened and rains descend to drown Stone\nBoy. Old Badger and the Grizzly Bear are appointed to burrow underneath\nour fortifications.\n\n“‘However, I am not at all afraid for myself, but I am anxious for you,\nMother, and for my uncles.’\n\n“‘Ugh!’ grunted all the uncles, ‘we told you that you would get into\ntrouble by killing so many of our sacred animals for your own amusement.\n\n“‘But,’ continued Stone Boy, ‘I shall make a good resistance, and I\nexpect you all to help me.’\n\n“Accordingly they all worked under his direction in preparing for the\ndefence. First of all, he threw a pebble into the air, and behold a\ngreat rocky wall around their teepee. A second, third, fourth and fifth\npebble became other walls without the first. From the sixth and seventh\nwere formed two stone lodges, one upon the other. The uncles meantime,\nmade numbers of bows and quivers full of arrows, which were ranged at\nconvenient distances along the tops of the walls. His mother prepared\ngreat quantities of food and made many moccasins for her boy, who\ndeclared that he would defend the fortress alone.\n\n“At last they saw the army of beasts advancing, each tribe by itself\nand commanded by a leader of extraordinary size. The onset was terrific.\nThey flung themselves against the high walls with savage cries, while\nthe badgers and other burrowing animals ceaselessly worked to undermine\nthem. Stone Boy aimed his sharp arrows with such deadly effect that his\nenemies fell by thousands. So great was their loss that the dead bodies\nof the animals formed a barrier higher than the first, and the armies\nretired in confusion.\n\n“But reinforcements were at hand. The rain fell in torrents; the beavers\nhad dammed all the rivers and there was a great flood. The besieged all\nretreated into the innermost lodge, but the water poured in through\nthe burrows made by the badgers and gophers, and rose until Stone Boy’s\nmother and his ten uncles were all drowned. Stone Boy himself could not\nbe entirely destroyed, but he was overcome by his enemies and left half\nburied in the earth, condemned never to walk again, and there we find\nhim to this day.\n\n“This was because he abused his strength, and destroyed for mere\namusement the lives of the creatures given him for use only.”\n\n\n\n\nVI. EVENING IN THE LODGE\n\n\n\n\nI: Evening in the Lodge\n\nI HAD been skating on that part of the lake where there was an overflow,\nand came home somewhat cold. I cannot say just how cold it was, but it\nmust have been intensely so, for the trees were cracking all about\nme like pistol shots. I did not mind, because I was wrapped up in my\nbuffalo robe with the hair inside, and a wide leather belt held it about\nmy loins. My skates were nothing more than strips of basswood bark bound\nupon my feet.\n\nI had taken off my frozen moccasins and put on dry ones in their places.\n\n“Where have you been and what have you been doing?” Uncheedah asked as\nshe placed before me some roast venison in a wooden bowl. “Did you see\nany tracks of moose or bear?”\n\n“No, grandmother, I have only been playing at the lower end of the\nlake. I have something to ask you,” I said, eating my dinner and supper\ntogether with all the relish of a hungry boy who has been skating in the\ncold for half a day.\n\n“I found this feather, grandmother, and I could not make out what tribe\nwear feathers in that shape.”\n\n“Ugh, I am not a man; you had better ask your uncle. Besides, you should\nknow it yourself by this time. You are now old enough to think about\neagle feathers.”\n\nI felt mortified by this reminder of my ignorance. It seemed a\nreflection on me that I was not ambitious enough to have found all such\nmatters out before.\n\n“Uncle, you will tell me, won’t you?” I said, in an appealing tone.\n\n“I am surprised, my boy, that you should fail to recognize this feather.\nIt is a Cree medicine feather, and not a warrior’s.”\n\n“Then,” I said, with much embarrassment, “you had better tell me again,\nuncle, the language of the feathers. I have really forgotten it all.”\n\nThe day was now gone; the moon had risen; but the cold had not lessened,\nfor the trunks of the trees were still snapping all around our teepee,\nwhich was lighted and warmed by the immense logs which Uncheedah’s\nindustry had provided. My uncle, White Foot-print, now undertook to\nexplain to me the significance of the eagle’s feather.\n\n“The eagle is the most war-like bird,” he began, “and the most kingly\nof all birds; besides, his feathers are unlike any others, and these are\nthe reasons why they are used by our people to signify deeds of bravery.\n\n“It is not true that when a man wears a feather bonnet, each one of\nthe feathers represents the killing of a foe or even a coup. When a man\nwears an eagle feather upright upon his head, he is supposed to have\ncounted one of four coups upon his enemy.”\n\n“Well, then, a coup does not mean the killing of an enemy?”\n\n“No, it is the after-stroke or touching of the body after he falls. It\nis so ordered, because oftentimes the touching of an enemy is much more\ndifficult to accomplish than the shooting of one from a distance. It\nrequires a strong heart to face the whole body of the enemy, in order to\ncount the coup on the fallen one, who lies under cover of his kinsmen’s\nfire. Many a brave man has been lost in the attempt.\n\n“When a warrior approaches his foe, dead or alive, he calls upon the\nother warriors to witness by saying: ‘I, Fearless Bear, your brave,\nagain perform the brave deed of counting the first (or second or\nthird or fourth) coup upon the body of the bravest of your enemies.’\nNaturally, those who are present will see the act and be able to testify\nto it. When they return, the heralds, as you know, announce publicly all\nsuch deeds of valor, which then become a part of the man’s war record.\nAny brave who would wear the eagle’s feather must give proof of his\nright to do so.\n\n“When a brave is wounded in the same battle where he counted his coup,\nhe wears the feather hanging downward. When he is wounded, but makes no\ncount, he trims his feather and in that case, it need not be an eagle\nfeather. All other feathers are merely ornaments. When a warrior wears\na feather with a round mark, it means that he slew his enemy. When the\nmark is cut into the feather and painted red, it means that he took the\nscalp.\n\n“A brave who has been successful in ten battles is entitled to a\nwar-bonnet; and if he is a recognized leader, he is permitted to wear\none with long, trailing plumes. Also those who have counted many coups\nmay tip the ends of the feathers with bits of white or colored down.\nSometimes the eagle feather is tipped with a strip of weasel skin; that\nmeans the wearer had the honor of killing, scalping and counting the\nfirst coup upon the enemy all at the same time.\n\n“This feather you have found was worn by a Cree--it is indiscriminately\npainted. All other feathers worn by the common Indians mean nothing,” he\nadded.\n\n“Tell me, uncle, whether it would be proper for me to wear any feathers\nat all if I have never gone upon the war-path.”\n\n“You could wear any other kind of feathers, but not an eagle’s,” replied\nmy uncle, “although sometimes one is worn on great occasions by the\nchild of a noted man, to indicate the father’s dignity and position.”\n\nThe fire had gone down somewhat, so I pushed the embers together and\nwrapped my robe more closely about me. Now and then the ice on the\nlake would burst with a loud report like thunder. Uncheedah was busy\nre-stringing one of uncle’s old snow-shoes. There were two different\nkinds that he wore; one with a straight toe and long; the other shorter\nand with an upturned toe. She had one of the shoes fastened toe down,\nbetween sticks driven into the ground, while she put in some new strings\nand tightened the others. Aunt Four Stars was beading a new pair of\nmoccasins.\n\nWabeda, the dog, the companion of my boyhood days, was in trouble\nbecause he insisted upon bringing his extra bone into the teepee, while\nUncheedah was determined that he should not. I sympathized with him,\nbecause I saw the matter as he did. If he should bury it in the snow\noutside, I knew Shunktokecha (the coyote) would surely steal it. I knew\njust how anxious Wabeda was about his bone. It was a fat bone--I mean a\nbone of a fat deer; and all Indians know how much better they are than\nthe other kind.\n\nWabeda always hated to see a good thing go to waste. His eyes spoke\nwords to me, for he and I had been friends for a long time. When I was\nafraid of anything in the woods, he would get in front of me at once and\ngently wag his tail. He always made it a point to look directly in my\nface. His kind, large eyes gave me a thousand assurances. When I was\nperplexed, he would hang about me until he understood the situation.\nMany times I believed he saved my life by uttering the dog word in time.\n\nMost animals, even the dangerous grizzly, do not care to be seen when\nthe two-legged kind and his dog are about. When I feared a surprise by\na bear or a grey wolf, I would say to Wabeda: “Now, my dog, give your\nwar-whoop:” and immediately he would sit up on his haunches and bark\n“to beat the band” as you white boys say. When a bear or wolf heard the\nnoise, he would be apt to retreat.\n\nSometimes I helped Wabeda and gave a warwhoop of my own. This drove the\ndeer away as well, but it relieved my mind.\n\nWhen he appealed to me on this occasion, therefore, I said: “Come, my\ndog, let us bury your bone so that no Shunktokecha will take it.”\n\nHe appeared satisfied with my suggestion, so we went out together.\n\nWe dug in the snow and buried our bone wrapped up in a piece of old\nblanket, partly burned; then we covered it up again with snow. We knew\nthat the coyote would not touch anything burnt. I did not put it up a\ntree because Wabeda always objected to that, and I made it a point to\nconsult his wishes whenever I could.\n\nI came in and Wabeda followed me with two short rib bones in his mouth.\nApparently he did not care to risk those delicacies.\n\n“There,” exclaimed Uncheedah, “you still insist upon bringing in some\nsort of bone!” but I begged her to let him gnaw them inside because it\nwas so cold. Having been granted this privilege, he settled himself at\nmy back and I became absorbed in some specially nice arrows that uncle\nwas making.\n\n“O, uncle, you must put on three feathers to all of them so that they\ncan fly straight,” I suggested.\n\n“Yes, but if there are only two feathers, they will fly faster,” he\nanswered.\n\n“Woow!” Wabeda uttered his suspicions.\n\n“Woow!” he said again, and rushed for the entrance of the teepee. He\nkicked me over as he went and scattered the burning embers.\n\n“En na he na!” Uncheedah exclaimed, but he was already outside.\n\n“Wow, wow, wow! Wow, Wow, wow!”\n\nA deep guttural voice answered him.\n\nOut I rushed with my bow and arrows in my hand.\n\n“Come, uncle, come! A big cinnamon bear!” I shouted as I emerged from\nthe teepee.\n\nUncle sprang out and in a moment he had sent a swift arrow through the\nbear’s heart. The animal fell dead. He had just begun to dig up Wabeda’s\nbone, when the dog’s quick ear had heard the sound.\n\n“Ah, uncle, Wabeda and I ought to have at least a little eaglet’s\nfeather for this. I too sent my small arrow into the bear before he\nfell,” I exclaimed. “But I thought all bears ought to be in their lodges\nin the winter time. What was this one doing at this time of the year and\nnight?”\n\n“Well,” said my uncle, “I will tell you. Among the tribes, some are\nnaturally lazy. The cinnamon bear is the lazy one of his tribe. He alone\nsleeps out of doors in the winter and because he has not a warm bed, he\nis soon hungry. Sometimes he lives in the hollow trunk of a tree, where\nhe has made a bed of dry grass; but when the night is very cold, like\nto-night, he has to move about to keep himself from freezing and as he\nprowls around, he gets hungry.”\n\nWe dragged the huge carcass within our lodge. “O, what nice claws he\nhas, uncle!” I exclaimed eagerly. “Can I have them for my necklace?”\n\n“It is only the old medicine men who wear them regularly. The son of\na great warrior who has killed a grizzly may wear them upon a public\noccasion,” he explained.\n\n“And you are just like my father and are considered the best hunter\namong the Santees and Sissetons. You have killed many grizzlies so that\nno one can object to my bear’s-claws necklace,” I said appealingly.\n\nWhite Foot-print smiled. “My boy, you shall have them,” he said, “but it\nis always better to earn them yourself.” He cut the claws off carefully\nfor my use.\n\n“Tell me, uncle, whether you could wear these claws all the time?” I\nasked.\n\n“Yes, I am entitled to wear them, but they are so heavy and\nuncomfortable,” he replied, with a superior air.\n\nAt last the bear had been skinned and dressed and we all resumed our\nusual places. Uncheedah was particularly pleased to have some more fat\nfor her cooking.\n\n“Now, grandmother, tell me the story of the bear’s fat. I shall be so\nhappy if you will,” I begged.\n\n“It is a good story and it is true. You should know it by heart and gain\na lesson from it,” she replied. “It was in the forests of Minnesota,\nin the country that now belongs to the Ojibways. From the Bedawakanton\nSioux village a young married couple went into the woods to get fresh\nvenison. The snow was deep; the ice was thick. Far away in the woods\nthey pitched their lonely teepee. The young man was a well-known hunter\nand his wife a good maiden of the village.\n\n“He hunted entirely on snow-shoes, because the snow was very deep. His\nwife had to wear snow-shoes too, to get to the spot where they pitched\ntheir tent. It was thawing the day they went out, so their path was\ndistinct after the freeze came again.\n\n“The young man killed many deer and bears. His wife was very busy curing\nthe meat and trying out the fat while he was away hunting each day.\nIn the evenings she kept on trying the fat. He sat on one side of the\nteepee and she on the other.\n\n“One evening, she had just lowered a kettle of fat to cool, and as she\nlooked into the hot fat she saw the face of an Ojibway scout looking\ndown at them through the smoke-hole. She said nothing, nor did she\nbetray herself in any way.\n\n“After a little she said to her husband in a natural voice:\n‘Marpeetopah, some one is looking at us through the smoke hole, and I\nthink it is an enemy’s scout.’\n\n“Then Marpeetopah (Four-skies) took up his bow and arrows and began to\nstraighten and dry them for the next day’s hunt, talking and laughing\nmeanwhile. Suddenly he turned and sent an arrow upward, killing the\nOjibway, who fell dead at their door.\n\n“‘Quick, Wadutah!’ he exclaimed; ‘you must hurry home upon our trail. I\nwill stay here. When this scout does not return, the warparty may come\nin a body or send another scout. If only one comes, I can soon dispatch\nhim and then I will follow you. If I do not do that, they will overtake\nus in our flight.’\n\n“Wadutah (Scarlet) protested and begged to be allowed to stay with her\nhusband, but at last she came away to get reinforcements.\n\n“Then Marpeetopah (Four-skies) put more sticks on the fire so that the\nteepee might be brightly lit and show him the way. He then took the\nscalp of the enemy and proceeded on his track, until he came to the\nupturned root of a great tree. There he spread out his arrows and laid\nout his tomahawk.\n\n“Soon two more scouts were sent by the Ojibway war-party to see what was\nthe trouble and why the first one failed to come back. He heard them as\nthey approached. They were on snowshoes. When they came close to him, he\nshot an arrow into the foremost. As for the other, in his effort to\nturn quickly his snow-shoes stuck in the deep snow and detained him, so\nMarpeetopah killed them both.\n\n“Quickly he took the scalps and followed Wadutah. He ran hard. But the\nOjibways suspected something wrong and came to the lonely teepee,\nto find all their scouts had been killed. They followed the path of\nMarpeetopah and Wadutah to the main village, and there a great battle\nwas fought on the ice. Many were killed on both sides. It was after this\nthat the Sioux moved to the Mississippi river.”\n\nI was sleepy by this time and I rolled myself up in my buffalo robe and\nfell asleep.\n\n\n\n\nII. Adventures of My Uncle\n\nIT was a beautiful fall day--‘a gopher’s last look back,’ as we used to\nsay of the last warm days of the late autumn. We were encamped beside\na wild rice lake, where two months before we had harvested our watery\nfields of grain, and where we had now returned for the duck-hunting.\nAll was well with us. Ducks were killed in countless numbers, and in the\nevenings the men hunted deer in canoes by torchlight along the shores of\nthe lake. But alas! life is made up of good times and bad times, and it\nis when we are perfectly happy that we should expect some overwhelming\nmisfortune.\n\n“So it was that upon this peaceful and still morning, all of a sudden a\nharsh and terrible war-cry was heard! Your father was then quite a young\nman, and a very ambitious warrior, so that I was always frightened on\nhis account whenever there was a chance of fighting. But I did not think\nof your uncle, Mysterious Medicine, for he was not over fifteen at the\ntime; besides, he had never shown any taste for the field.\n\n“Our camp was thrown into great excitement; and as the warriors advanced\nto meet the enemy, I was almost overcome by the sight of your uncle\namong them! It was of no use for me to call him back--I think I prayed\nin that moment to the Great Mystery to bring my boy safely home.\n\n“I shall never forget, as long as I live, the events of that day. Many\nbrave men were killed; among them two of your uncle’s intimate friends.\nBut when the battle was over, my boy came back; only his face was\nblackened in mourning for his friends, and he bore several wounds in his\nbody. I knew that he had proved himself a true warrior.\n\n“This was the beginning of your uncle’s career, He has surpassed your\nfather and your grandfather; yes, all his ancestors except Jingling\nThunder, in daring and skill.”\n\nSuch was my grandmother’s account of the maiden battle of her third\nson, Mysterious Medicine. He achieved many other names; among them Big\nHunter, Long Rifle and White Footprint. He had a favorite Kentucky rifle\nwhich he carried for many years. The stock was several times broken,\nbut he always made another. With this gun he excelled most of\nhis contemporaries in accuracy of aim. He used to call the weapon\nIshtahbopopa--a literal translation would be “Pops-the-eye.”\n\nMy uncle, who was a father to me for ten years of my life, was almost a\ngiant in his proportions, very symmetrical and “straight as an arrow.”\n His face was not at all handsome. He had very quiet and reserved manners\nand was a man of action rather than of unnecessary words. Behind the\nveil of Indian reticence he had an inexhaustible fund of wit and humor;\nbut this part of his character only appeared before his family and very\nintimate friends. Few men know nature more thoroughly than he. Nothing\nirritated him more than to hear some natural fact misrepresented. I\nhave often thought that with education he might have made a Darwin or an\nAgassiz.\n\nHe was always modest and unconscious of self in relating his adventures.\n“I have often been forced to realize my danger,” he used to say, “but\nnot in such a way as to overwhelm me. Only twice in my life have I been\nreally frightened, and for an instant lost my presence of mind.\n\n“Once I was in full pursuit of a large buck deer that I had wounded.\nIt was winter, and there was a very heavy fall of fresh snow upon the\nground. All at once I came upon the body of the deer lying dead on the\nsnow. I began to make a hasty examination, but before I had made any\ndiscoveries, I spied the tips of two ears peeping just above the surface\nof the snow about twenty feet from me. I made a feint of not seeing\nanything at all, but moved quickly in the direction of my gun, which was\nleaning against a tree. Feeling, somehow, that I was about to be taken\nadvantage of, I snatched at the same moment my knife from my belt.\n\n“The panther (for such it was) made a sudden and desperate spring.\nI tried to dodge, but he was too quick for me. He caught me by the\nshoulder with his great paw, and threw me down. Somehow, he did not\nretain his hold, but made another leap and again concealed himself in\nthe snow. Evidently he was preparing to make a fresh attack.\n\n“I was partially stunned and greatly confused by the blow; therefore I\nshould have been an easy prey for him at the moment. But when he left\nme, I came to my senses; and I had been thrown near my gun! I arose and\naimed between the tips of his ears--all that was visible of him--and\nfired. I saw the fresh snow fly from the spot. The panther leaped about\nsix feet straight up into the air, and fell motionless. I gave two good\nwarwhoops, because I had conquered a very formidable enemy. I sat down\non the dead body to rest, and my heart beat as if it would knock out all\nmy ribs. I had not been expecting any danger, and that was why I was so\ntaken by surprise.\n\n“The other time was on the plains, in summer. I was accustomed to\nhunting in the woods, and never before had hunted buffalo on horseback.\nBeing a young man, of course I was eager to do whatever other men did.\nTherefore I saddled my pony for the hunt. I had a swift pony and a good\ngun, but on this occasion I preferred a bow and arrows.\n\n“It was the time of year when the buffalo go in large herds and the\nbulls are vicious. But this did not trouble me at all; indeed, I thought\nof nothing but the excitement and honor of the chase.\n\n“A vast plain near the Souris river was literally covered with an\nimmense herd. The day was fair, and we came up with them very easily. I\nhad a quiver full of arrows, with a sinew-backed bow.\n\n“My pony carried me in far ahead of all the others. I found myself in\nthe midst of the bulls first, for they are slow. They threw toward\nme vicious glances, so I hastened my pony on to the cows. Soon I was\nenveloped in a thick cloud of dust, and completely surrounded by the\nherd, who were by this time in the act of fleeing, their hoofs making a\nnoise like thunder.\n\n“I could not think of anything but my own situation, which confused me\nfor the moment. It seemed to me to be a desperate one. If my pony, which\nwas going at full speed, should step into a badger hole, I should be\nthrown to the ground and trampled under foot in an instant. If I were to\nstop, they would knock me over, pony and all. Again, it seemed as if my\nhorse must fall from sheer exhaustion; and then what would become of me?\n\n“At last I awoke to a calm realization of my own power. I uttered a yell\nand began to shoot right and left. Very soon there were only a few old\nbulls who remained near me. The herd had scattered, and I was miles away\nfrom my companions.\n\n“It is when we think of our personal danger that we are apt to be at\na loss to do the best thing under the circumstances. One should be\nunconscious of self in order to do his duty. We are very apt to think\nourselves brave, when we are most timid. I have discovered that half our\nyoung men give the war-whoop when they are frightened, because they fear\nlest their silence may betray their state of mind. I think we are really\nbravest when most calm and slow to action.”\n\nI urged my uncle to tell me more of his adventures.\n\n“Once,” said he, “I had a somewhat peculiar experience, which I think\nI never related to you before. It was at the time of the fall hunt. One\nafternoon when I was alone I discovered that I was too far away to reach\nthe camp before dark, so I looked about for a good place to spend the\nnight. This was on the Upper Missouri, before there were any white\npeople there, and when we were in constant danger from wild beasts as\nwell as from hostile Indians. It was necessary to use every precaution\nand the utmost vigilance.\n\n“I selected a spot which appeared to be well adapted to defense. I had\nkilled two deer, and I hung up pieces of the meat at certain distances\nin various directions. I knew that any wolf would stop for the meat, A\ngrizzly bear would sometimes stop, but not a mountain lion or a panther.\nTherefore I made a fire. Such an animal would be apt to attack a\nsolitary fire. There was a full moon that night, which was much in my\nfavor.\n\n“Having cooked and eaten some of the venison, I rolled myself in my\nblanket and lay down by the fire, taking my Ishtahbopopa for a bed\nfellow. I hugged it very closely, for I felt that I should need it\nduring the night. I had scarcely settled myself when I heard what seemed\nto be ten or twelve coyotes set up such a howling that I was quite sure\nof a visit from them. Immediately after-. ward I heard another sound,\nwhich was like the screaming of a small child. This was a porcupine,\nwhich had doubtless smelled the meat.\n\n“I watched until a coyote appeared upon a flat rock fifty yards away.\nHe sniffed the air in every direction; then, sitting partly upon his\nhaunches, swung round in a circle with his hind legs sawing the air, and\nhowled and barked in many different keys. It was a great feat! I could\nnot help wondering whether I should be able to imitate him. What had\nseemed to be the voices of many coyotes was in reality only one animal.\nHis mate soon appeared and then they both seemed satisfied, and showed\nno signs of a wish to invite another to join them. Presently they both\nsuddenly and quietly disappeared.\n\n“At this moment a slight noise attracted my attention, and I saw that\nthe porcupine had arrived. He had climbed up to the piece of meat\nnearest me, and was helping himself without any ceremony. I thought it\nwas fortunate that he came, for he would make a good watch dog for me.\nVery soon, in fact, he interrupted his meal, and caused all his quills\nto stand out in defiance. I glanced about me and saw the two coyotes\nslyly approaching my open camp from two different directions.\n\n“I took the part of the porcupine! I rose in a sitting posture, and sent\na swift arrow to each of my unwelcome visitors. They both ran away with\nhowls of surprise and pain.\n\n“The porcupine saw the whole from his perch, but his meal was not at all\ndisturbed, for he began eating again with apparent relish. Indeed, I was\nsoon furnished with another of these unconscious protectors. This one\ncame from the opposite direction to a point where I had hung a splendid\nham of venison. He cared to go no further, but seated himself at once on\na convenient branch and began his supper.\n\n“The canon above me was full of rocks and trees. From this direction\ncame a startling noise, which caused me more concern than anything I had\nthus far heard. It sounded much like a huge animal stretching himself,\nand giving a great yawn which ended in a scream. I knew this for the\nvoice of a mountain lion, and it decided me to perch upon a limb for the\nrest of the night.\n\n“I got up and climbed into the nearest large tree, taking my weapons\nwith me; but first I rolled a short log of wood in my blanket and laid\nit in my place by the fire.\n\n“As I got up, the two porcupines began to descend, but I paid no\nattention to them, and they soon returned to their former positions.\nVery soon I heard a hissing sound from one of them, and knew that an\nintruder was near. Two grey wolves appeared.\n\n“I had hung the hams by the ham strings, and they were fully eight\nfeet from the ground. At first the wolves came boldly forward, but the\nwarning of the porcupines caused them to stop, and hesitate to jump for\nthe meat. However, they were hungry, and began to leap savagely for the\nhams, although evidently they proved good targets for the quills of the\nprickly ones, for occasionally one of them would squeal and rub his nose\ndesperately against the tree.\n\n“At last one of the wolves buried his teeth too deeply in a tough\nportion of the flesh, and having jumped to reach it, his own weight\nmade it impossible for him to loosen his upper jaw. There the grey wolf\ndangled, kicking and yelping, until the tendon of the ham gave way, and\nboth fell heavily to the ground. From my hiding-place I sent two arrows\ninto his body, which ended his life. The other one ran away to a little\ndistance and remained there a long time, as if waiting for her mate.\n\n“I was now very weary, but I had seen many grizzly bears’ tracks in the\nvicinity, and besides, I had not forgotten the dreadful scream of the\nmountain lion. I determined to continue my watch.\n\n“As I had half expected, there came presently a sudden heavy fall, and\nat the same time the burning embers were scattered about and the fire\nalmost extinguished. My blanket with the log in it was rolled over\nseveral times, amid snarls and growls. Then the assailant of my camp--a\npanther--leaped back into the thick underbrush, but not before my arrow\nhad penetrated his side. He snarled and tried to bite off the shaft, but\nafter a time became exhausted and lay still.\n\n“I could now distinguish the grey dawn in the east. I was exceedingly\ndrowsy, so I fastened myself by a rope of raw-hide to the trunk of the\ntree against which I leaned. I was seated on a large limb, and soon fell\nasleep.\n\n“I was rudely awakened by the report of a gun directly under me. At\nthe same time, I thought some one was trying to shake me off the tree,\nInstantly I reached for my gun. Alas! it was gone! At the first shake\nof the tree by my visitor, a grizzly bear, the gun had fallen, and as it\nwas cocked, it went off.\n\n“The bear picked up the weapon and threw it violently away; then he\nagain shook the tree with all his strength. I shouted:\n\n“‘I have still a bow and a quiver full of arrows; you had better let me\nalone.’\n\n“He replied to this with a rough growl. I sent an arrow into his side,\nand he groaned like a man as he tried hard to pull it out. I had to give\nhim several more before he went a short distance away, and died. It was\nnow daylight, so I came down from my perch. I was stiff, and scarcely\nable to walk. I found that the bear had killed both of my little\nfriends, the porcupines, and eaten most of the meat.\n\n“Perhaps you wonder, Ohiyesa, why I did not use my gun in the beginning;\nbut I had learned that if I once missed my aim with it, I had no second\nchance. I have told of this particular adventure, because it was an\nunusual experience to see so many different animals in one night. I have\noften been in similar places, and killed one or two. Once a common black\nbear stole a whole deer from me without waking me. But all this life is\nfast disappearing, and the world is becoming different.”\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE END OF THE BEAR DANCE\n\nIT was one of the superstitions of the Santee Sioux to treat disease\nfrom the standpoint of some animal or inanimate thing. That person who,\naccording to their belief, had been commissioned to become a medicine\nman or a war chief, must not disobey the bear or other creature or\nthing which gave him his commission. If he ever ventured to do so, the\noffender must pay for his insubordination with his life, or that of his\nown child or dearest friend. It was supposed to be necessary that the\nsupernatural orders be carried into effect at a particular age and a\ncertain season of the year. Occasionally a very young man, who excused\nhimself on the ground of youth and modesty, might be forgiven.\n\nOne of my intimate friends had been a sufferer from what, I suppose,\nmust have been consumption. He, like myself, had a grandmother in whom\nhe had unlimited faith. But she was a very ambitious and pretentious\nwoman. Among her many claims was that of being a great “medicine woman,”\n and many were deceived by it; but really she was a fraud, for she did\nnot give any medicine, but “conjured” the sick exclusively.\n\nAt this time my little friend was fast losing ground, in spite of\nhis grandmother’s great pretensions. At last I hinted to him that my\ngrandmother was a herbalist, and a skilful one. But he hinted back to me\nthat ‘most any old woman who could dig roots could be a herbalist, and\nthat without a supernatural commission there was no power that could\ncope with disease. I defended my ideal on the ground that there are\nsupernatural powers in the herbs themselves; hence those who understand\nthem have these powers at their command.\n\n“But,” insisted my friend, “one must get his knowledge from the Great\nMystery!”\n\nThis completely silenced my argument, but did not shake my faith in my\ngrandmother’s ability.\n\nRedhorn was a good boy, and I loved him. I visited him often, and found\nhim growing weaker day by day.\n\n“Ohiyesa,” he said to me one day, “my grandmother has discovered the\ncause of my sickness.”\n\nI eagerly interrupted him by shouting: “And can she cure you now,\nRedhorn?”\n\n“Of course,” he replied, “she cannot until I have fulfilled the\ncommandment. I have confessed to her that two years ago I received my\ncommission, and I should have made a Bear Dance and proclaimed myself a\nmedicine man last spring, when I had seen thirteen winters. You see, I\nwas ashamed to proclaim myself a medicine man, being so young; and for\nthis I am punished. However, my grandmother says it is not yet too late.\nBut, Ohiyesa, I am as weak now as a rheumatic old man. I can scarcely\nstand up. They say that I can appoint some one else to act for me. He\nwill be the active bear--I shall have to remain in the hole. Would you,\nOhiyesa, be willing to act the bear for me? You know he has to chase the\ndancers away from his den.”\n\n“Redhorn,” I replied with much embarrassment, “I should be happy to do\nanything that I could for you, but I cannot be a bear. I feel that I\nam not fit. I am not large enough; I am not strong enough; and I don’t\nunderstand the habits of the animal well enough. I do not think you\nwould be pleased with me as your substitute.”\n\nRedhorn finally decided that he would engage a larger boy to perform\nfor him. A few days later, it was announced by the herald that my friend\nwould give a Bear Dance, at which he was to be publicly proclaimed a\nmedicine man. It would be the great event of his short existence, for\nthe disease had already exhausted his strength and vitality. Of course,\nwe all understood that there would be an active youth to exhibit the\nferocious nature of the beast after which the dance is named.\n\nThe Bear Dance was an entertainment, a religious rite, a method of\ntreating disease--all in one. A strange thing about it was that no woman\nwas allowed to participate in the orgies, unless she was herself the\nbear.\n\nThe den was usually dug about two hundred yards from the camp, on some\nconspicuous plain. It was about two feet deep and six feet square and\nover it was constructed an arbor of boughs with four openings. When the\nbear man sang, all the men and boys would gather and dance about the\nden; and when he came out and pursued them there was a hasty retreat. It\nwas supposed that whoever touched the bear without being touched by him\nwould overcome a foe in the field. If one was touched, the reverse was\nto be expected. The thing which caused most anxiety among the dancers\nwas the superstition that if one of them should accidentally trip and\nfall while pursued by the bear, a sudden death would visit him or his\nnearest relative.\n\nBoys of my age were disposed to run some risk in this dance; they would\ntake every opportunity to strike at the bear man with a short switch,\nwhile the older men shot him with powder. It may as well be admitted\nthat one reason for my declining the honor offered me by my friend\nRedhorn was that I was afraid of powder, and I much preferred to be\none of the dancers and take my chances of touching the bear man without\nbeing touched.\n\nIt was a beautiful summer’s day. The forest behind our camp was sweet\nwith the breath of blossoming flowers. The teepees faced a large lake,\nwhich we called Bedatanka. Its gentle waves cooled the atmosphere.\nThe water-fowl disported themselves over its surface, and the birds of\npassage overhead noisily expressed their surprise at the excitement and\nconfusion in our midst.\n\nThe herald, with his brassy voice, again went the rounds, announcing the\nday’s event and the tardy fulfillment of the boy’s commission. Then\ncame the bustle of preparation. The out-door toilet of the people\nwas performed with care. I cannot describe just how I was attired or\npainted, but I am under the impression that there was but little of my\nbrown skin that was not uncovered. The others were similarly dressed in\nfeathers, paint and tinkling ornaments.\n\nI soon heard the tom-tom’s doleful sound from the direction of the\nbear’s den, and a few warwhoops from the throats of the youthful\nwarriors. As I joined the motley assembly, I noticed that the bear man’s\ndrum was going in earnest, and soon after he began to sing. This was the\ninvitation to the dance.\n\nAn old warrior gave the signal and we all started for the den, very much\nlike a group of dogs attacking a stranger. Frantically we yelled and\nwhooped, running around the sheltering arbor in a hop, skip and jump\nfashion. In spite of the apparent confusion, however, every participant\nwas on the alert for the slightest movement of the bear man.\n\nAll of a sudden, a brave gave the warning, and we scattered in an\ninstant over the little plain between the den and our village. Everybody\nseemed to be running for dear life, and I soon found myself some yards\nbehind the rest. I had gone in boldly, partly because of conversations\nwith certain boys who proposed to participate, and whom I usually\noutdistanced in foot races. But it seemed that they had not carried\nout their intentions and I was left alone. I looked back once or twice,\nalthough I was pretty busy with my legs, and I imagined that my pursuer,\nthe bear man, looked twice as fearful as a real bear. He was dressed and\npainted up with a view to terrify the crowd. I did not want the others\nto guess that I was at all dismayed, so I tried to give the war-whoop;\nbut my throat was so dry at the moment that I am sure I must have given\nit very poorly.\n\nJust as it seemed that I was about to be overtaken, the dancers who\nhad deserted me suddenly slackened their speed, and entered upon the\namusement of tormenting the bear man with gunpowder and switches, with\nwhich they touched him far from gently upon his naked body. They now\nchased him in turn, and he again retreated to his den.\n\nWe rested until we heard the tom-tom and the song once more, and then\nwe rushed forth with fresh eagerness to the mimic attack. This time I\nobserved all necessary precautions for my own safety. I started in\nmy flight even before the warning was given, for I saw the bear man\ngathering himself up to spring upon the dancers. Thus I had plenty of\nleeway to observe what occurred. The bear man again pursued the yelling\nand retreating mob, and was dealt with unmercifully by the swift-footed.\nHe became much excited as he desperately chased a middle-aged man, who\noccasionally turned and fired off his gun, but was suddenly tripped by\nan ant-hill and fell to the ground, with the other on top of him. The\nexcitement was intense. The bear man returned to his companion, and the\ndancers gathered in little knots to exchange whispers.\n\n“Is it not a misfortune?” “The most surefooted of us all!” “Will he\ndie?” “Must his beautiful daughter be sacrificed?”\n\nThe man who was the subject of all this comment did not speak a word.\nHis head hung down. Finally he raised it and said in a resolute voice:\n\n“We all have our time to go, and when the Great Mystery calls us we must\nanswer as cheerfully as at the call of one of our own war-chiefs here\non earth. I am not sad for myself, but my heart is not willing that my\nWinona (first-born daughter) should be called.”\n\nNo one replied. Presently the last tom-tom was heard and the dancers\nrallied once more. The man who had fallen did not join them, but turned\nto the council lodge, where the wise old men were leisurely enjoying the\ncalumet. They beheld him enter with some surprise; but he threw himself\nupon a buffalo robe, and resting his head upon his right hand, related\nwhat had happened to him. Thereupon the aged men exclaimed as with one\nvoice: “It never fails!” After this, he spoke no more.\n\nMeanwhile, we were hilariously engaged in our last dance, and when the\nbear man finally retired, we gathered about the arbor to congratulate\nthe sick bear man. But, to our surprise, his companion did not re-enter\nthe den. “He is dead! Redhorn, the bear man, is dead!” We all rushed to\nthe spot. My poor friend, Redhorn, lay dead in the den.\n\nAt this instant there was another commotion in the camp. Everybody was\nrunning toward the council lodge. A well-known medicine man was loudly\nsummoned thither. But, alas! the man who fell in the dance had suddenly\ndropped dead.\n\nTo the people, another Indian superstition had been verified.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE MAIDENS’ FEAST\n\nTHERE were many peculiar customs among the Indians of an earlier period,\nsome of which tended to strengthen the character of the people and\npreserve their purity. Perhaps the most unique of these was the annual\n“feast of maidens.” The casual observer would scarcely understand the\nfull force and meaning of this ceremony.\n\nThe last one that I ever witnessed was given at Fort Ellis, Manitoba,\nabout the year 1871. Upon the table land just back of the old trading\npost and fully a thousand feet above the Assiniboine river, surrounded\nby groves, there was a natural amphitheatre. At one end stood the old\nfort where since 1830 the northern tribes had come to replenish their\npowder horns and lead sacks and to dispose of their pelts.\n\nIn this spot there was a reunion of all the renegade Sioux on the one\nhand and of the Assiniboines and Crees, the Canadian tribes, on the\nother. They were friendly. The matter was not formally arranged, but it\nwas usual for all the tribes to meet here in the month of July.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company always had a good supply of red, blue, green and\nwhite blankets, also cloth of brilliant dye, so that when their summer\nfestival occurred the Indians did not lack gayly colored garments.\nPaints were bought by them at pleasure. Short sleeves were the fashion\nin their buckskin dresses, and beads and porcupine quills were the\nprincipal decorations.\n\nWhen circumstances are favorable, the Indians are the happiest people in\nthe world. There were entertainments every single day, which everybody\nhad the fullest opportunity to see and enjoy. If anything, the poorest\nprofited the most by these occasions, because a feature in each case was\nthe giving away of savage wealth to the needy in honor of the event. At\nany public affair, involving the pride and honor of a prominent family,\nthere must always be a distribution of valuable presents.\n\nOne bright summer morning, while we were still at our meal of jerked\nbuffalo meat, we heard the herald of the Wahpeton band upon his calico\npony as he rode around our circle.\n\n\n“White Eagle’s daughter, the maiden Red Star, invites all the maidens\nof all the tribes to come and partake of her feast. It will be in the\nWahpeton camp, before the sun reaches the middle of the sky. All pure\nmaidens are invited. Red Star also invites the young men to be present,\nto see that no unworthy maiden should join in the feast.”\n\nThe herald soon completed the rounds of the different camps, and it was\nnot long before the girls began to gather in great numbers. The fort\nwas fully alive to the interest of these savage entertainments. This\nparticular feast was looked upon as a semi-sacred affair. It would be\ndesecration for any to attend who was not perfectly virtuous. Hence\nit was regarded as an opportune time for the young men to satisfy\nthemselves as to who were the virtuous maids of the tribe.\n\nThere were apt to be surprises before the end of the day. Any young man\nwas permitted to challenge any maiden whom he knew to be unworthy. But\nwoe to him who could not prove his case. It meant little short of death\nto the man who endeavored to disgrace a woman without cause.\n\nThe youths had a similar feast of their own, in which the eligibles were\nthose who had never spoken to a girl in the way of courtship. It was\nconsidered ridiculous so to do before attaining some honor as a warrior,\nand the novices prided themselves greatly upon their self control.\n\nFrom the various camps the girls came singly or in groups, dressed in\nbright-colored calicoes or in heavily fringed and beaded buckskin. Their\nsmooth cheeks and the central part of their glossy hair was touched with\nvermilion. All brought with them wooden basins to eat from. Some who\ncame from a considerable distance were mounted upon ponies; a few, for\ncompany or novelty’s sake, rode double.\n\nThe maidens’ circle was formed about a coneshaped rock which stood upon\nits base. This was painted red. Beside it two new arrows were lightly\nstuck into the ground. This is a sort of altar, to which each maiden\ncomes before taking her assigned place in the circle, and lightly\ntouches first the stone and then the arrows. By this oath she declares\nher purity. Whenever a girl approaches the altar there is a stir among\nthe spectators, and sometimes a rude youth would call out:\n\n“Take care! You will overturn the rock, or pull out the arrows!”\n\nSuch a remark makes the girls nervous, and especially one who is not\nsure of her composure.\n\nImmediately behind the maidens’ circle is the old women’s or chaperons’\ncircle. This second circle is almost as interesting to look at as the\ninner one. The old women watched every movement of their respective\ncharges with the utmost concern, having previously instructed them how\nthey should conduct themselves in any event.\n\nThere was never a more gorgeous assembly of the kind than this one.\nThe day was perfect. The Crees, displaying their characteristic\nhorsemanship, came in groups; the Assiniboines, with their curious\npompadour well covered with red paint. The various bands of Sioux all\ncarefully observed the traditional peculiarities of dress and behavior.\nThe attaches of the fort were fully represented at the entertainment,\nand it was not unusual to see a pale-face maiden take part in the feast.\n\nThe whole population of the region had assembled, and the maidens came\nshyly into the circle. The simple ceremonies observed prior to the\nserving of the food were in progress, when among a group of Wahpeton\nSioux young men there was a stir of excitement. All the maidens glanced\nnervously toward the scene of the disturbance. Soon a tall youth emerged\nfrom the throng of spectators and advanced toward the circle. Every one\nof the chaperons glared at him as if to deter him from his purpose. But\nwith a steady step he passed them by and approached the maidens’ circle.\n\nAt last he stopped behind a pretty Assiniboine maiden of good family and\nsaid:\n\n“I am sorry, but, according to custom, you should not be here.”\n\nThe girl arose in confusion, but she soon recovered her self-control.\n\n“What do you mean?” she demanded, indignantly. “Three times you have\ncome to court me, but each time I have refused to listen to you. I\nturned my back upon you. Twice I was with Mashtinna. She can tell the\npeople that this is true. The third time I had gone for water when you\nintercepted me and begged me to stop and listen. I refused because I did\nnot know you. My chaperon, Makatopawee, knows that I was gone but a few\nminutes. I never saw you anywhere else.”\n\nThe young man was unable to answer this unmistakable statement of facts,\nand it became apparent that he had sought to revenge himself for her\nrepulse.\n\n“Woo! woo! Carry him out!” was the order of the chief of the Indian\npolice, and the audacious youth was hurried away into the nearest ravine\nto be chastised.\n\nThe young woman who had thus established her good name returned to the\ncircle, and the feast was served. The “maidens’ song” was sung, and four\ntimes they danced in a ring around the altar. Each maid as she departed\nonce more took her oath to remain pure until she should meet her\nhusband.\n\n\n\n\nIX. MORE LEGENDS\n\n\n\n\nI: A Legend of Devil’s Lake\n\nAFTER the death of Smoky Day, old Weyuha was regarded as the greatest\nstory-teller among the Wahpeton Sioux.\n\n“Tell me, good Weyuha, a legend of your father’s country,” I said to him\none evening, for I knew the country which is now known as North Dakota\nand Southern Manitoba was their ancient hunting-ground. I was prompted\nby Uncheedah to make this request, after the old man had eaten in our\nlodge.\n\n“Many years ago,” he began, as he passed the pipe to uncle, “we traveled\nfrom the Otter-tail to Minnewakan (Devil’s Lake). At that time the\nmound was very distinct where Chotanka lies buried. The people of his\nimmediate band had taken care to preserve it.\n\n“This mound under which lies the great medicine man is upon the summit\nof Minnewakan Chantay, the highest hill in all that region. It is shaped\nlike an animal’s heart placed on its base, with the apex upward.\n\n“The reason why this hill is called Minnewakan Chantay, or the Heart of\nthe Mysterious Land, I will now tell you. It has been handed down\nfrom generation to generation, far beyond the memory of our\ngreat-grandparents. It was in Chotanka’s line of descent that these\nlegends were originally kept, but when he died the stories became\neverybody’s, and then no one believed in them. It was told in this way.”\n\nI sat facing him, wholly wrapped in the words of the story-teller, and\nnow I took a deep breath and settled myself so that I might not disturb\nhim by the slightest movement while he was reciting his tale. We were\ntaught this courtesy to our elders, but I was impulsive and sometimes\nforgot.\n\n“A long time ago,” resumed Weyuha, “the red people were many in number,\nand they inhabited all the land from the coldest place to the region of\nperpetual summer time. It seemed that they were all of one tongue, and\nall were friends.\n\n“All the animals were considered people in those days. The buffalo, the\nelk, the antelope, were tribes of considerable importance. The bears\nwere a smaller band, but they obeyed the mandates of the Great Mystery\nand were his favorites, and for this reason they have always known more\nabout the secrets of medicine. So they were held in much honor. The\nwolves, too, were highly regarded at one time. But the buffalo, elk,\nmoose, deer and antelope were the ruling people.\n\n“These soon became conceited and considered themselves very important,\nand thought no one could withstand them. The buffalo made war upon the\nsmaller tribes, and destroyed many. So one day the Great Mystery thought\nit best to change the people in form and in language.\n\n“He made a great tent and kept it dark for ten days. Into this tent he\ninvited the different bands, and when they came out they were greatly\nchanged, and some could not talk at all after that. However, there is\na sign language given to all the animals that no man knows except some\nmedicine men, and they are under a heavy penalty if they should tell it.\n\n“The buffalo came out of the darkened tent the clumsiest of all\nthe animals. The elk and moose were burdened with their heavy and\nmany-branched horns, while the antelope and deer were made the most\ndefenseless of animals, only that they are fleet of foot. The bear and\nthe wolf were made to prey upon all the others.\n\n“Man was alone then. When the change came, the Great Mystery allowed him\nto keep his own shape and language. He was king over all the animals,\nbut they did not obey him. From that day, man’s spirit may live with the\nbeasts before he is born a man. He will then know the animal language\nbut he cannot tell it in human speech. He always retains his sympathy\nwith them, and can converse with them in dreams.\n\n“I must not forget to tell you that the Great Mystery pitched his tent\nin this very region. Some legends say that the Minnewakan Chantay was\nthe tent itself, which afterward became earth and stones. Many of\nthe animals were washed and changed in this lake, the Minnewakan, or\nMysterious Water. It is the only inland water we know that is salt. No\nanimal has ever swum in this lake and lived.”\n\n“Tell me,” I eagerly asked, “is it dangerous to man also?”\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “we think so; and no Indian has ever ventured in that\nlake to my knowledge. That is why the lake is called Mysterious,” he\nrepeated.\n\n“I shall now tell you of Chotanka. He was the greatest of medicine\nmen. He declared that he was a grizzly bear before he was born in human\nform.” Weyuha seemed to become very earnest when he reached this point\nin his story. “Listen to Chotanka’s life as a grizzly bear.”\n\n“‘As a bear,’ he used to say, ‘my home was in sight of the Minnewakan\nChantay. I lived with my mother only one winter, and I only saw my\nfather when I was a baby. Then we lived a little way from the Chantay\nto the north, among scattered oak upon a hillside overlooking the\nMinnewakan.\n\n“‘When I first remember anything, I was playing outside of our home with\na buffalo skull that I had found near by. I saw something that looked\nstrange. It walked upon two legs, and it carried a crooked stick, and\nsome red willows with feathers tied to them. It threw one of the willows\nat me, and I showed my teeth and retreated within our den.\n\n“‘Just then my father and mother came home with a buffalo calf. They\nthrew down the dead calf, and ran after the queer thing. He had long\nhair upon a round head. His face was round, too. He ran and climbed up\ninto a small oak tree.\n\n“‘My father and mother shook him down, but not before he had shot some\nof his red willows into their sides. Mother was very sick, but she\ndug some roots and ate them and she was well again.’ It was thus that\nChotanka was first taught the use of certain roots for curing wounds and\nsickness,” Weyuha added.\n\n“‘One day’”--he resumed the grizzly’s story--“‘when I was out hunting\nwith my mother-my father had gone away and never came back--we found\na buffalo cow with her calf in a ravine. She advised me to follow her\nclosely, and we crawled along on our knees. All at once mother crouched\ndown under the grass, and I did the same. We saw some of those queer\nbeings that we called “two legs,” riding upon big-tail deer (ponies).\nThey yelled as they rode toward us. Mother growled terribly and rushed\nupon them. She caught one, but many more came with their dogs and drove\nus into a thicket. They sent the red willows singing after us, and two\nof them stuck in mother’s side. When we got away at last she tried to\npull them out, but they hurt her terribly. She pulled them both out at\nlast, but soon after she lay down and died.\n\n“‘I stayed in the woods alone for two days then I went around the\nMinnewakan Chantay on the south side and there made my lonely den. There\nI found plenty of hazel nuts, acorns and wild plums. Upon the plains the\nteepsinna were abundant, and I saw nothing of my enemies.\n\n“‘One day I found a footprint not unlike my own. I followed it to\nsee who the stranger might be. Upon the bluffs among the oak groves\nI discovered a beautiful young female gathering acorns. She was of a\ndifferent band from mine, for she wore a jet black dress.\n\n“‘At first she was disposed to resent my intrusion; but when I told her\nof my lonely life she agreed to share it with me. We came back to my\nhome on the south side of the hill. There we lived happy for a whole\nyear. When the autumn came again Woshepee, for this was her name, said\nthat she must make a warm nest for the winter, and I was left alone\nagain.’\n\n“Now,” said Weyuha, “I have come to a part of my story that few people\nunderstand. All the long winter Chotanka slept in his den, and with\nthe early spring there came a great thunder storm. He was aroused by a\nfrightful crash that seemed to shake the hills; and lo! a handsome young\nman stood at his door. He looked, but was not afraid, for he saw that\nthe stranger carried none of those red willows with feathered tips. He\nwas unarmed and smiling.\n\n“‘I come,’ said he, ‘with a challenge to run a race. Whoever wins will\nbe the hero of his kind, and the defeated must do as the winner says\nthereafter. This is a rare honor that I have brought you. The whole\nworld will see the race. The animal world will shout for you, and the\nspirits will cheer me on. You are not a coward, and therefore you will\nnot refuse my challenge.’\n\n“‘No,’ replied Chotanka, after a short hesitation. The young man was\nfine-looking, but lightly built.\n\n“‘We shall start from the Chantay, and that will be our goal. Come, let\nus go, for the universe is waiting!’ impatiently exclaimed the stranger.\n\n“He passed on in advance, and just then an old, old wrinkled man came to\nChotanka’s door. He leaned forward upon his staff.\n\n“‘My son,’ he said to him, ‘I don’t want to make you a coward, but\nthis young man is the greatest gambler of the universe. He has powerful\nmedicine. He gambles for life; be careful! My brothers and I are the\nonly ones who have ever beaten him. But he is safe, for if he is killed\nhe can resurrect himself--I tell you he is great medicine.\n\n“‘However, I think that I can save you--listen! He will run behind you\nall the way until you are within a short distance of the goal. Then he\nwill pass you by in a flash, for his name is ZigZag Fire! (lightning).\nHere is my medicine.’ So speaking, he gave me a rabbit skin and the gum\nof a certain plant. ‘When you come near the goal, rub yourself with the\ngum, and throw the rabbit skin between you. He cannot pass you.’\n\n“‘And who are you, grandfather?’ Chotanka inquired.\n\n“‘I am the medicine turtle,’ the old man replied. ‘The gambler is a\nspirit from heaven, and those whom he outruns must shortly die. You have\nheard, no doubt, that all animals know beforehand when they are to be\nkilled; and any man who understands these mysteries may also know when\nhe is to die.’\n\n“The race was announced to the world. The buffalo, elk, wolves and all\nthe animals came to look on. All the spirits of the air came also to\ncheer for their comrade. In the sky the trumpet was sounded--the great\nmedicine drum was struck. It was the signal for a start. The course\nwas around the Minnewakan. (That means around the earth or the ocean.)\nEverywhere the multitude cheered as the two sped by.\n\n“The young man kept behind Chotanka all the time until they came once\nmore in sight of the Chantay. Then he felt a slight shock and he threw\nhis rabbit skin back. The stranger tripped and fell. Chotanka rubbed\nhimself with the gum, and ran on until he reached the goal. There was\na great shout that echoed over the earth, but in the heavens there was\nmuttering and grumbling. The referee declared that the winner would live\nto a good old age, and Zig-Zag Fire promised to come at his call. He was\nindeed great medicine,” Weyuha concluded.\n\n“But you have not told me how Chotanka became a man,” I said.\n\n“One night a beautiful woman came to him in his sleep. She enticed him\ninto her white teepee to see what she had there. Then she shut the door\nof the teepee and Chotanka could not get out. But the woman was kind\nand petted him so that he loved to stay in the white teepee. Then it was\nthat he became a human born. This is a long story, but I think, Ohiyesa,\nthat you will remember it,” said Weyuha, and so I did.\n\n\n\n\nII. Manitoshaw’s Hunting\n\nIT was in the winter, in the Moon of Difficulty (January). We had eaten\nour venison roast for supper, and the embers were burning brightly.\nOur teepee was especially cheerful. Uncheedah sat near the entrance, my\nuncle and his wife upon the opposite side, while I with my pets occupied\nthe remaining space.\n\nWabeda, the dog, lay near the fire in a half doze, watching out of the\ncorners of his eyes the tame raccoon, which snuggled back against\nthe walls of the teepee, his shrewd brain, doubtless, concocting some\nmischief for the hours of darkness. I had already recited a legend of\nour people. All agreed that I had done well. Having been generously\npraised, I was eager to earn some more compliments by learning a new\none, so I begged my uncle to tell me a story. Musingly he replied:\n\n“I can give you a Sioux-Cree tradition,” and immediately began:\n\n“Many winters ago, there were six teepees standing on the southern slope\nof Moose mountain in the Moon of Wild Cherries (September). The men to\nwhom these teepees belonged had been attacked by the Sioux while hunting\nbuffalo, and nearly all killed. Two or three who managed to get home\nto tell their sad story were mortally wounded, and died soon afterward.\nThere was only one old man and several small boys left to hunt and\nprovide for this unfortunate little band of women and children.\n\n“They lived upon teepsinna (wild turnips) and berries for many days.\nThey were almost famished for meat. The old man was too feeble to hunt\nsuccessfully. One day in this desolate camp a young Cree maiden--for\nsuch they were--declared that she could no longer sit still and see her\npeople suffer. She took down her dead father’s second bow and quiver\nfull of arrows, and begged her old grandmother to accompany her to Lake\nWanagiska, where she knew that moose had oftentimes been found. I forgot\nto tell you that her name was Manitoshaw.\n\n“This Manitoshaw and her old grandmother, Nawakewee, took each a pony\nand went far up into the woods on the side of the mountain. They pitched\ntheir wigwam just out of sight of the lake, and hobbled their ponies.\nThen the old woman said to Manitoshaw:\n\n“‘Go, my granddaughter, to the outlet of the Wanagiska, and see if there\nare any moose tracks there. When I was a young woman, I came here with\nyour father’s father, and we pitched our tent near this spot. In the\nnight there came three different moose. Bring me leaves of the birch and\ncedar twigs; I will make medicine for moose,’ she added.\n\n“Manitoshaw obediently disappeared in the woods. It was a grove of\nbirch and willow, with two good springs. Down below was a marshy place.\nNawakewee had bidden the maiden look for nibbled birch and willow twigs,\nfor the moose loves to eat them, and to have her arrow ready upon the\nbow-string. ‘I have seen this very place many a time,’ added my uncle,\nand this simple remark gave to the story an air of reality.\n\n“The Cree maiden went first to the spring, and there found fresh tracks\nof the animal she sought. She gathered some cedar berries and chewed\nthem, and rubbed some of them on her garments so that the moose might\nnot scent her. The sun was already set, and she felt she must return to\nNawakewee.\n\n“Just then Hinhankaga, the hooting owl, gave his doleful night call. The\ngirl stopped and listened attentively.\n\n“‘I thought it was a lover’s call,’ she whispered to herself. A singular\nchallenge pealed across the lake. She recognized the alarm call of the\nloon, and fancied that the bird might have caught a glimpse of her game.\n\n“Soon she was within a few paces of the temporary lodge of pine boughs\nand ferns which the grandmother had constructed. The old woman met her\non the trail.\n\n“‘Ah, my child, you have returned none too soon. I feared you had\nventured too far away; for the Sioux often come to this place to hunt.\nYou must not expose yourself carelessly on the shore.’\n\n“As the two women lay down to sleep they could hear the ponies munch\nthe rich grass in an open spot near by. Through the smoke hole of the\npine-bough wigwam Manitoshaw gazed up into the starry sky, and dreamed\nof what she would do on the morrow when she should surprise the wily\nmoose. Her grandmother was already sleeping so noisily that it was\nenough to scare away the game. At last the maiden, too, lost herself in\nsleep.\n\n“Old Nawakewee awoke early. First of all she made a fire and burned\ncedar and birch so that the moose might not detect the human smell. Then\nshe quickly prepared a meal of wild turnips and berries, and awoke the\nmaiden, who was surprised to see that the sun was already up. She ran\ndown to the spring and hastily splashed handsful of the cold water in\nher face; then she looked for a moment in its mirror-like surface.\nThere was the reflection of two moose by the open shore and beyond them\nManitoshaw seemed to see a young man standing. In another moment all\nthree had disappeared.\n\n“‘What is the matter with my eyes? I am not fully awake yet, and I\nimagine things. Ugh, it is all in my eyes,’ the maiden repeated to\nherself. She hastened back to Nawakewee. The vision was so unexpected\nand so startling that she could not believe in its truth, and she said\nnothing to the old woman.\n\n“Breakfast eaten, Manitoshaw threw off her robe and appeared in her\nscantily cut gown of buckskin with long fringes, and moccasins and\nleggings trimmed with quills of the porcupine. Her father’s bow and\nquiver were thrown over one shoulder, and the knife dangled from her\nbelt in its handsome sheath. She ran breathlessly along the shore toward\nthe outlet.\n\n“Way off near the island Medoza the loon swam with his mate,\noccasionally uttering a cry of joy. Here and there the playful Hogan,\nthe trout, sprang gracefully out of the water, in a shower of falling\ndew. As the maiden hastened along she scared up Wadawasee, the\nkingfisher, who screamed loudly.\n\n“‘Stop, Wadawasee, stop--you will frighten my game!’\n\n“At last she had reached the outlet. She saw at once that the moose\nhad been there during the night. They had torn up the ground and broken\nbirch and willow twigs in a most disorderly way.”\n\n“Ah!” I exclaimed, “I wish I had been with Manitoshaw then!”\n\n“Hush, my boy; never interrupt a storyteller.”\n\nI took a stick and began to level off the ashes in front of me, and to\ndraw a map of the lake, the outlet, the moose and Manitoshaw. Away off\nto one side was the solitary wigwam, Nawakewee and the ponies.\n\n“Manitoshaw’s heart was beating so loud that she could not hear\nanything,” resumed my uncle. “She took some leaves of the wintergreen\nand chewed them to calm herself. She did not forget to throw in passing\na pinch of pulverized tobacco and paint into the spring for Manitou, the\nspirit.\n\n“Among the twinkling leaves of the birch her eye was caught by a moving\nform, and then another. She stood motionless, grasping her heavy bow.\nThe moose, not suspecting any danger, walked leisurely toward the\nspring. One was a large female moose; the other a yearling.\n\n“As they passed Manitoshaw, moving so naturally and looking so harmless,\nshe almost forgot to let fly an arrow. The mother moose seemed to\nlook in her direction, but did not see her. They had fairly passed her\nhiding-place when she stepped forth and sent a swift arrow into the side\nof the larger moose. Both dashed into the thick woods, but it was too\nlate. The Cree maiden had already loosened her second arrow. Both fell\ndead before reaching the shore.”\n\n“Uncle, she must have had a splendid aim, for in the woods the many\nlittle twigs make an arrow bound off to one side,” I interrupted in\ngreat excitement.\n\n“Yes, but you must remember she was very near the moose.”\n\n“It seems to me, then, uncle, that they must have scented her, for\nyou have told me that they possess the keenest nose of any animal,” I\npersisted.\n\n“Doubtless the wind was blowing the other way. But, nephew, you must let\nme finish my story.\n\n“Overjoyed by her success, the maiden hastened back to Nawakawee, but she\nwas gone! The ponies were gone, too, and the wigwam of branches had been\ndemolished. While Manitoshaw stood there, frightened and undecided what\nto do, a soft voice came from behind a neighboring thicket:\n\n“‘Manitoshaw! Manitoshaw! I am here!’\n\n“She at once recognized, the voice and found it to be Nawakeewee, who\ntold a strange story. That morning a canoe had crossed the Wanagiska\ncarrying two men. They were Sioux. The old grandmother had seen them\ncoming, and to deceive them she at once pulled down her temporary\nwigwam, and drove the ponies off toward home. Then she hid herself in\nthe bushes near by, for she knew that Manitoshaw must return there.\n\n“‘Come, my granddaughter, we must hasten home by another way,’ cried the\nold woman.\n\n“But the maiden said, ‘No, let us go first to my two moose that I killed\nthis morning and take some meat with us.’\n\n“‘No, no, my child; the Sioux are cruel. They have killed many of\nour people. If we stay here they will find us. I fear, I fear them,\nManitoshaw!’\n\n“At last the brave maid convinced her grandmother, and the more easily\nas she too was hungry for meat. They went to where the big game lay\namong the bushes, and began to dress the moose.”\n\n“I think, if I were they, I would hide all day. I would wait until the\nSioux had gone; then I would go back to my moose,” I interrupted for the\nthird time.\n\n“I will finish the story first; then you may tell us what you would do,”\n said my uncle reprovingly.\n\n“The two Sioux were father and son. They too had come to the lake for\nmoose; but as the game usually retreated to the island, Chatansapa had\nlanded his son Kangiska to hunt them on the shore while he returned in\nhis canoe to intercept their flight. The young man sped along the sandy\nbeach and soon discovered their tracks. He followed them up and found\nblood on the trail. This astonished him. Cautiously he followed on until\nhe found them both lying dead. He examined them and found that in each\nmoose there was a single Cree arrow. Wishing to surprise the hunter if\npossible, Kangiska lay hidden in the bushes.\n\n“After a little while the two women returned to the spot. They passed\nhim as close as the moose had passed the maiden in the morning. He saw\nat once that the maiden had arrows in her quiver like those that had\nslain the big moose. He lay still.\n\n“Kangiska looked upon the beautiful Cree maiden and loved her. Finally\nhe forgot himself and made a slight motion. Manitoshaw’s quick eye\ncaught the little stir among the bushes, but she immediately looked the\nother way and Kangiska believed that she had not seen anything, At last\nher eyes met his, and something told both that all was well. Then the\nmaiden smiled, and the young man could not remain still any longer.\nHe arose suddenly and the old woman nearly fainted from fright. But\nManitoshaw said:\n\n“‘Fear not, grandmother; we are two and he is only one.’\n\n“While the two women continued to cut up the meat, Kangiska made a fire\nby rubbing cedar chips together, and they all ate of the moose meat.\nThen the old woman finished her work, while the young people sat down\nupon a log in the shade, and told each other all their minds.\n\n“Kangiska declared by signs that he would go home with Manitoshaw to the\nCree camp, for he loved her. They went home, and the young man hunted\nfor the unfortunate Cree band during the rest of his life.\n\n“His father waited a long time on the island and afterward searched the\nshore, but never saw him again. He supposed that those footprints he saw\nwere made by Crees who had killed his son.”\n\n“Is that story true, uncle?” I asked eagerly.\n\n“‘Yes, the facts are well known. There are some Sioux mixed bloods among\nthe Crees to this day who are descendants of Kangiska.”\n\n\n\n\nX. INDIAN LIFE AND ADVENTURE\n\n\n\n\nI: Life in the Woods\n\nTHE month of September recalls to every Indian’s mind the season of the\nfall hunt. I remember one such expedition which is typical of many. Our\nparty appeared on the northwestern side of Turtle mountain; for we had\nbeen hunting buffaloes all summer, in the region of the Mouse river,\nbetween that mountain and the upper Missouri.\n\nAs our cone-shaped teepees rose in clusters along the outskirts of the\nheavy forest that clothes the sloping side of the mountain, the scene\nbelow was gratifying to a savage eye. The rolling yellow plains were\ncheckered with herds of buffaloes. Along the banks of the streams that\nran down from the mountains were also many elk, which usually appear\nat morning and evening, and disappear into the forest during the warmer\npart of the day. Deer, too, were plenty, and the brooks were alive with\ntrout. Here and there the streams were dammed by the industrious beaver.\n\nIn the interior of the forest there were lakes with many islands, where\nmoose, elk, deer and bears were abundant. The water-fowl were wont to\ngather here in great numbers, among them the crane, the swan, the loon,\nand many of the smaller kinds. The forest also was filled with a great\nvariety of birds. Here the partridge drummed his loudest, while the\nwhippoorwill sang with spirit, and the hooting owl reigned in the night.\n\nTo me, as a boy, this wilderness was a paradise. It was a land of\nplenty. To be sure, we did not have any of the luxuries of civilization,\nbut we had every convenience and opportunity and luxury of Nature. We\nhad also the gift of enjoying our good fortune, whatever dangers might\nlurk about us; and the truth is that we lived in blessed ignorance of\nany life that was better than our own.\n\nAs soon as hunting in the woods began, the customs regulating it were\nestablished. The council teepee no longer existed. A hunting bonfire was\nkindled every morning at day-break, at which each brave must appear and\nreport. The man who failed to do this before the party set out on the\nday’s hunt was harassed by ridicule. As a rule, the hunters started\nbefore sunrise, and the brave who was announced throughout the camp as\nthe first one to return with a deer on his back, was a man to be envied.\n\nThe legend-teller, old Smoky Day, was chosen herald of the camp, and it\nwas he who made the announcements. After supper was ended, we heard his\npowerful voice resound among the teepees in the forest. He would then\nname a man to kindle the bonfire the next morning. His suit of fringed\nbuckskin set off his splendid physique to advantage.\n\nScarcely had the men disappeared in the woods each morning than all the\nboys sallied forth, apparently engrossed in their games and sports,\nbut in reality competing actively with one another in quickness of\nobservation. As the day advanced, they all kept the sharpest possible\nlookout. Suddenly there would come the shrill “Woo-coohoo!” at the top\nof a boy’s voice, announcing the bringing in of a deer. Immediately all\nthe other boys took up the cry, each one bent on getting ahead of the\nrest. Now we all saw the brave Wacoota fairly bent over by his burden, a\nlarge deer which he carried on his shoulders. His fringed buckskin shirt\nwas besprinkled with blood. He threw down the deer at the door of his\nwife’s mother’s home, according to custom, and then walked proudly\nto his own. At the door of his father’s teepee he stood for a moment\nstraight as a pine-tree, and then entered.\n\nWhen a bear was brought in, a hundred or more of these urchins were wont\nto make the woods resound with their voices: “Wah! wah! wah! Wah! wah!\nwah! The brave White Rabbit brings a bear! Wah! wah! wah!”\n\nAll day these sing-song cheers were kept up, as the game was brought\nin. At last, toward the close of the afternoon, all the hunters had\nreturned, and happiness and contentment reigned absolute, in a fashion\nwhich I have never observed among the white people, even in the best\nof circumstances. The men were lounging and smoking; the women actively\nengaged in the preparation of the evening meal, and the care of the\nmeat. The choicest of the game was cooked and offered to the Great\nMystery, with all the accompanying ceremonies. This we called the\n“medicine feast.” Even the women, as they lowered the boiling pot,\nor the fragrant roast of venison ready to serve, would first whisper:\n“Great Mystery, do thou partake of this venison, and still be gracious!”\n This was the commonly said “grace.”\n\nEverything went smoothly with us, on this occasion, when we first\nentered the woods. Nothing was wanting to our old way of living. The\nkilling of deer and elk and moose had to be stopped for a time, since\nmeat was so abundant that we had no use for them any longer. Only the\nhunting for pelts, such as those of the bear, beaver, marten, and otter\nwas continued. But whenever we lived in blessed abundance, our braves\nwere wont to turn their thoughts to other occupations--especially the\nhot-blooded youths whose ambition it was to do something noteworthy.\n\nAt just such moments as this there are always a number of priests in\nreadiness, whose vocation it is to see into the future, and each of whom\nconsults his particular interpreter of the Great Mystery. (This ceremony\nis called by the white people “making medicine.”) To the priests the\nyouthful braves hint their impatience for the war-path. Soon comes the\ndesired dream or prophecy or vision to favor their departure.\n\nOur young men presently received their sign, and for a few days all was\nhurry and excitement. On the appointed morning we heard the songs of the\nwarriors and the wailing of the women, by which they bade adieu to\neach other, and the eligible braves, headed by an experienced man--old\nHotanka or Loud-Voiced Raven--set out for the Gros Ventre country.\n\nOur older heads, to be sure, had expressed some disapproval of the\nundertaking, for the country in which we were roaming was not our own,\nand we were likely at any time to be taken to task by its rightful\nowners. The plain truth of the matter was that we were intruders. Hence\nthe more thoughtful among us preferred to be at home, and to achieve\nwhat renown they could get by defending their homes and families. The\nyoung men, however, were so eager for action and excitement that they\nmust needs go off in search of it.\n\nFrom the early morning when these braves left us, led by the old\nwar-priest, Loud-Voiced Raven, the anxious mothers, sisters and\nsweethearts counted the days. Old Smoky Day would occasionally get up\nearly in the morning, and sing a “strong-heart” song for his absent\ngrandson. I still seem to hear the hoarse, cracked voice of the ancient\nsinger as it resounded among the woods. For a long time our roving\ncommunity enjoyed unbroken peace, and we were spared any trouble or\ndisturbance. Our hunters often brought in a deer or elk or bear for\nfresh meat. The beautiful lakes furnished us with fish and wild-fowl\nfor variety. Their placid waters, as the autumn advanced, reflected the\nvariegated colors of the changing foliage.\n\nIt is my recollection that we were at this time encamped in the vicinity\nof the “Turtle Mountain’s Heart.” It is to the highest cone-shaped peak\nthat the Indians aptly give this appellation. Our camping-ground for two\nmonths was within a short distance of the peak, and the men made it a\npoint to often send one of their number to the top. It was understood\nbetween them and the war party that we were to remain near this spot;\nand on their return trip the latter were to give the “smoke sign,” which\nwe would answer from the top of the hill.\n\nOne day, as we were camping on the shore of a large lake with several\nislands, signs of moose were discovered, and the men went off to them on\nrafts, carrying their flint-lock guns in anticipation of finding two or\nthree of the animals. We little fellows, as usual, were playing down by\nthe sandy shore, when we spied what seemed like the root of a great tree\nfloating toward us. But on a closer scrutiny we discovered our error.\nIt was the head of a huge moose, swimming for his life! Fortunately for\nhim, none of the men had remained at home.\n\nAccording to our habit, we little urchins disappeared in an instant,\nlike young prairie chickens, in the long grass. I was not more than\neight years old, yet I tested the strength of my bowstring and adjusted\nmy sharpest and best arrow for immediate service. My heart leaped\nviolently as the homely but imposing animal neared the shore. I was\nundecided for a moment whether I would not leave my hiding-place and\ngive a war-whoop as soon as he touched the sand. Then I thought I would\nkeep still and let him have my boy weapon; and the only regret that\nI had was that he would, in all probability, take it with him, and I\nshould be minus one good arrow.\n\n“Still,” I thought, “I shall claim to be the smallest boy whose arrow\nwas ever carried away by a moose.” That was enough. I gathered myself\ninto a bunch, all ready to spring. As the long-legged beast pulled\nhimself dripping out of the water, and shook off the drops from his long\nhair, I sprang to my feet. I felt some of the water in my face! I gave\nhim my sharpest arrow with all the force I could master, right among the\nfloating ribs. Then I uttered my warwhoop.\n\nThe moose did not seem to mind the miniature weapon, but he was very\nmuch frightened by our shrill yelling. He took to his long legs, and in\na minute was out of sight.\n\nThe leaves had now begun to fall, and the heavy frosts made the nights\nvery cold. We were forced to realize that the short summer of that\nregion had said adieu! Still we were gay and lighthearted, for we had\nplenty of provisions, and no misfortune had yet overtaken us in our\nwanderings over the country for nearly three months.\n\nOne day old Smoky Day returned from the daily hunt with an alarm. He had\nseen a sign-a “smoke sign.” This had not appeared in the quarter that\nthey were anxiously watching--it came from the east. After a long\nconsultation among the men, it was concluded from the nature and\nduration of the smoke that it proceeded from an accidental fire. It was\nfurther surmised that the fire was not made by Sioux, since it was out\nof their country, but by a war-party of Ojibways, who were accustomed\nto use matches when lighting their pipes, and to throw them carelessly\naway. It was thought that a little time had been spent in an attempt to\nput it out.\n\nThe council decreed that a strict look-out should be established in\nbehalf of our party. Every day a scout was appointed to reconnoitre in\nthe direction of the smoke. It was agreed that no gun should be fired\nfor twelve days. All our signals were freshly rehearsed among the men.\nThe women and old men went so far as to dig little convenient holes\naround their lodges, for defense in case of a sudden attack. And yet an\nOjibway scout would not have suspected, from the ordinary appearance of\nthe camp, that the Sioux had become aware of their neighborhood! Scouts\nwere stationed just outside of the village at night. They had been so\ntrained as to rival an owl or a cat in their ability to see in the dark.\n\nThe twelve days passed by, however, without bringing any evidence of\nthe nearness of the supposed Ojibway war-party, and the “lookout”\n established for purposes of protection was abandoned. Soon after this,\none morning at dawn, we were aroused by the sound of the unwelcome\nwarwhoop. Although only a child, I sprang up and was about to rush out,\nas I had been taught to do; but my good grandmother pulled me down, and\ngave me a sign to lay flat on the ground. I sharpened my ears and lay\nstill.\n\nAll was quiet in camp, but at some little distance from us there was a\nlively encounter. I could distinctly hear the old herald, shouting and\nyelling in exasperation. “Whoo! whoo!” was the signal of distress, and I\ncould almost hear the pulse of my own blood-vessels.\n\nCloser and closer the struggle came, and still the women appeared to\ngrow more and more calm. At last a tremendous charge by the Sioux put\nthe enemy to flight; there was a burst of yelling; alas! my friend and\nteacher, old Smoky Day, was silent. He had been pierced to the heart by\nan arrow from the Ojibways.\n\nAlthough successful, we had lost two of our men, Smoky Day and White\nCrane, and this incident, although hardly unexpected, darkened our\npeaceful sky. The camp was filled with songs of victory, mingled with\nthe wailing of the relatives of the slain. The mothers of the youths who\nwere absent on the war-path could no longer conceal their anxiety.\n\nOne frosty morning--for it was then near the end of October--the weird\nsong of a solitary brave was heard. In an instant the camp was thrown\ninto indescribable confusion. The meaning of this was clear as day to\neverybody--all of our war-party were killed, save the one whose mournful\nsong announced the fate of his companions. The lonely warrior was Bald\nEagle.\n\nThe village was convulsed with grief; for in sorrow, as in joy, every\nIndian shares with all the others. The old women stood still, wherever\nthey might be, and wailed dismally, at intervals chanting the praises\nof the departed warriors. The wives went a little way from their teepees\nand there audibly mourned; but the young maidens wandered further away\nfrom the camp, where no one could witness their grief. The old men\njoined in the crying and singing. To all appearances the most unmoved of\nall were the warriors, whose tears must be poured forth in the country\nof the enemy to embitter their vengeance. These sat silently within\ntheir lodges, and strove to conceal their feelings behind a stoical\ncountenance; but they would probably have failed had not the soothing\nweed come to their relief.\n\nThe first sad shock over, then came the change of habiliments. In\nsavage usage, the outward expression of mourning surpasses that of\ncivilization. The Indian mourner gives up all his good clothing, and\ncontents himself with scanty and miserable garments. Blankets are cut in\ntwo, and the hair is cropped short. Often a devoted mother would\nscarify her arms or legs; a sister or a young wife would cut off all her\nbeautiful hair and disfigure herself by undergoing hardships. Fathers\nand brothers blackened their faces, and wore only the shabbiest\ngarments. Such was the spectacle that our people presented when the\nbright autumn was gone and the cold shadow of winter and misfortune\nhad fallen upon us. “We must suffer,” said they--“the Great Mystery is\noffended.”\n\n\n\n\nII. A Winter Camp\n\nWHEN I was about twelve years old we wintered upon the Mouse river, west\nof Turtle mountain. It was one of the coldest winters I ever knew, and\nwas so regarded by the old men of the tribe. The summer before there had\nbeen plenty of buffalo upon that side of the Missouri, and our people\nhad made many packs of dried buffalo meat and cached them in different\nplaces, so that they could get them in case of need. There were many\nblack-tailed deer and elk along the river, and grizzlies were to be\nfound in the open country. Apparently there was no danger of starvation,\nso our people thought to winter there; but it proved to be a hard\nwinter.\n\nThere was a great snow-fall, and the cold was intense. The snow was\ntoo deep for hunting, and the main body of the buffalo had crossed the\nMissouri, where it was too far to go after them. But there were some\nsmaller herds of the animals scattered about in our vicinity, therefore\nthere was still fresh meat to be had, but it was not secured without a\ngreat deal of difficulty.\n\nNo ponies could be used. The men hunted on snow-shoes until after the\nMoon of Sore Eyes (March), when after a heavy thaw a crust was formed\non the snow which would scarcely hold a man. It was then that our people\nhunted buffalo with dogs--an unusual expedient.\n\nSleds were made of buffalo ribs and hickory saplings, the runners bound\nwith rawhide with the hair side down. These slipped smoothly over the\nicy crust. Only small men rode on the sleds. When buffalo were reported\nby the hunting-scouts, everybody had his dog team ready. All went under\norders from the police, and approached the herd under cover until they\ncame within charging distance.\n\nThe men had their bows and arrows, and a few had guns. The huge animals\ncould not run fast in the deep snow. They all followed a leader,\ntrampling out a narrow path. The dogs with their drivers soon caught up\nwith them on each side, and the hunters brought many of them down.\n\nI remember when the party returned, late in the night. The men came\nin single file, well loaded, and each dog following his master with an\nequally heavy load. Both men and animals were white with frost.\n\nWe boys had waited impatiently for their arrival. As soon as we spied\nthem coming a buffalo hunting whistle was started, and every urchin in\nthe village added his voice to the weird sound, while the dogs who had\nbeen left at home joined with us in the chorus. The men, wearing their\nbuffalo moccasins with the hair inside and robes of the same, came home\nhungry and exhausted.\n\nIt is often supposed that the dog in the Indian camp is a useless member\nof society, but it is not so in the wild life. We found him one of the\nmost useful of domestic animals, especially in an emergency.\n\nWhile at this camp a ludicrous incident occurred that is still told\nabout the camp-fires of the Sioux. One day the men were hunting on\nsnow-shoes, and contrived to get within a short distance of the buffalo\nbefore they made the attack. It was impossible to run fast, but the huge\nanimals were equally unable to get away. Many were killed. Just as the\nherd reached an open plain one of the buffaloes stopped and finally lay\ndown. Three of the men who were pursuing him shortly came up. The animal\nwas severely wounded, but not dead.\n\n“I shall crawl up to him from behind and stab him,” said Wamedee; “we\ncannot wait here for him to die.” The others agreed. Wamedee was not\nconsidered especially brave; but he took out his knife and held it\nbetween his teeth. He then approached the buffalo from behind and\nsuddenly jumped astride his back.\n\nThe animal was dreadfully frightened and struggled to his feet.\nWamedee’s knife fell to the ground, but he held on by the long shaggy\nhair. He had a bad seat, for he was upon the buffalo’s hump. There was\nno chance to jump off; he had to stay on as well as he could.\n\n“Hurry! hurry! shoot! shoot!” he screamed, as the creature plunged and\nkicked madly in the deep snow. Wamedee’s face looked deathly, they said;\nbut his two friends could not help laughing. He was still calling upon\nthem to shoot, but when the others took aim he would cry: “Don’t shoot!\ndon’t shoot! you will kill me!” At last the animal fell down with him;\nbut Wamedee’s two friends also fell down exhausted with laughter. He was\nridiculed as a coward thereafter.\n\nIt was on this very hunt that the chief Mato was killed by a buffalo. It\nhappened in this way. He had wounded the animal, but not fatally; so\nhe shot two more arrows at him from a distance. Then the buffalo became\ndesperate and charged upon him. In his flight Mato was tripped by\nsticking one of his snow-shoes into a snowdrift, from which he could not\nextricate himself in time. The bull gored him to death. The creek upon\nwhich this happened is now called Mato creek.\n\nA little way from our camp there was a log village of French Canadian\nhalf-breeds, but the two villages did not intermingle. About the Moon of\nDifficulty (January) we were initiated into some of the peculiar customs\nof our neighbors. In the middle of the night there was a firing of\nguns throughout their village. Some of the people thought they had been\nattacked, and went over to assist them, but to their surprise they were\ntold that this was the celebration of the birth of the new year!\n\nOur men were treated to minnewakan or “spirit water,” and they came home\ncrazy and foolish. They talked loud and sang all the rest of the night.\nFinally our head chief ordered his young men to tie these men up and put\nthem in a lodge by themselves. He gave orders to untie them “when the\nevil spirit had gone away.”\n\nDuring the next day all our people were invited to attend the\nhalf-breeds’ dance. I never knew before that a new year begins in\nmid-winter. We had always counted that the year ends when the winter\nends, and a new year begins with the new life in the springtime.\n\nI was now taken for the first time to a white man’s dance in a log\nhouse. I thought it was the dizziest thing I ever saw. One man sat in\na corner, sawing away at a stringed board, and all the while he was\nstamping the floor with his foot and giving an occasional shout. When he\ncalled out, the dancers seemed to move faster.\n\nThe men danced with women--something that we Indians never do--and when\nthe man in the corner shouted they would swing the women around. It\nlooked very rude to me, as I stood outside with the other boys and\npeeped through the chinks in the logs. At one time a young man and woman\nfacing each other danced in the middle of the floor. I thought they\nwould surely wear their moccasins out against the rough boards; but\nafter a few minutes they were relieved by another couple.\n\nThen an old man with long curly hair and a fox-skin cap danced alone in\nthe middle of the room, slapping the floor with his moccasined foot in\na lightning fashion that I have never seen equalled. He seemed to be\na leader among them. When he had finished, the old man invited our\nprincipal chief into the middle of the floor, and after the Indian had\ngiven a great whoop, the two drank in company. After this, there was so\nmuch drinking and loud talking among the men, that it was thought best\nto send us children back to the camp.\n\nIt was at this place that we found many sand boulders like a big “white\nman’s house.” There were holes in them like rooms, and we played in\nthese cave-like holes. One day, in the midst of our game, we found the\nskeleton of a great bear. Evidently he had been wounded and came there\nto die, for there were several arrows on the floor of the cave.\n\nThe most exciting event of this year was the attack that the Gros\nVentres made upon us just as we moved our camp upon the table land back\nof the river in the spring. We had plenty of meat then and everybody was\nhappy. The grass was beginning to appear and the ponies to grow fat.\n\nOne night there was a war dance. A few of our young men had planned to\ninvade the Gros Ventres country, but it seemed that they too had been\nthinking of us. Everybody was interested in the proposed war party.\n\n“Uncle, are you going too?” I eagerly asked him.\n\n“No,” he replied, with a long sigh. “It is the worst time of year to go\non the war-path. We shall have plenty of fighting this summer, as we are\ngoing to trench upon their territory in our hunts,” he added.\n\nThe night was clear and pleasant. The war drum was answered by the howls\nof coyotes on the opposite side of the Mouse river. I was in the throng,\nwatching the braves who were about to go out in search of glory. “I wish\nI were old enough; I would surely go with this party,” I thought. My\nfriend Tatanka was to go. He was several years older than I, and a\nhero in my eyes. I watched him as he danced with the rest until nearly\nmidnight. Then I came back to our teepee and rolled myself in my buffalo\nrobe and was soon lost in sleep.\n\nSuddenly I was aroused by loud war cries. “‘Woo! woo! hay-ay! hay-ay! U\nwe do! U we do!’” I jumped upon my feet, snatched my bow and arrows and\nrushed out of the teepee, frantically yelling as I went.\n\n“Stop! stop!” screamed Uncheedah, and caught me by my long hair.\n\nBy this time the Gros Ventres had encircled our camp, sending volleys\nof arrows and bullets into our midst. The women were digging ditches in\nwhich to put their children.\n\nMy uncle was foremost in the battle. The Sioux bravely withstood the\nassault, although several of our men had already fallen. Many of the\nenemy were killed in the field around our teepees. The Sioux at last got\ntheir ponies and made a counter charge, led by Oyemakasan (my uncle).\nThey cut the Gros Ventre party in two, and drove them off.\n\nMy friend Tatanka was killed. I took one of his eagle feathers, thinking\nI would wear it the first time that I ever went upon the war-path. I\nthought I would give anything for the opportunity to go against the Gros\nVentres, because they killed my friend. The war songs, the wailing for\nthe dead, the howling of the dogs was intolerable to me. Soon after this\nwe broke up our camp and departed for new scenes.\n\n\n\n\nIII. Wild Harvests\n\nWHEN our people lived in Minnesota, a good part of their natural\nsubsistence was furnished by the wild rice, which grew abundantly in all\nof that region. Around the shores and all over some of the innumerable\nlakes of the “Land of Sky-blue Water” was this wild cereal found.\nIndeed, some of the watery fields in those days might be compared\nin extent and fruitfulness with the fields of wheat on Minnesota’s\nmagnificent farms to-day.\n\nThe wild rice harvesters came in groups of fifteen to twenty families\nto a lake, depending upon the size of the harvest. Some of the Indians\nhunted buffalo upon the prairie at this season, but there were more who\npreferred to go to the lakes to gather wild rice, fish, gather berries\nand hunt the deer. There was an abundance of water-fowls among the\ngrain; and really no season of the year was happier than this.\n\nThe camping-ground was usually an attractive spot, with shade and cool\nbreezes off the water. The people, while they pitched their teepees upon\nthe heights, if possible, for the sake of a good outlook, actually lived\nin their canoes upon the placid waters. The happiest of all, perhaps,\nwere the young maidens, who were all day long in their canoes, in twos\nor threes, and when tired of gathering the wild cereal, would sit in the\nboats doing their needle-work.\n\nThese maidens learned to imitate the calls of the different water-fowls\nas a sort of signal to the members of a group. Even the old women and\nthe boys adopted signals, so that while the population of the village\nwas lost to sight in a thick field of wild rice, a meeting could be\narranged without calling any one by his or her own name. It was a great\nconvenience for those young men who sought opportunity to meet certain\nmaidens, for there were many canoe paths through the rice.\n\nAugust is the harvest month. There were many preliminary feasts of fish,\nducks and venison, and offerings in honor of the “Water Chief,” so\nthat there might not be any drowning accident during the harvest. The\npreparation consisted of a series of feasts and offerings for many days,\nwhile women and men were making birch canoes, for nearly every member\nof the family must be provided with one for this occasion. The blueberry\nand huckleberry-picking also preceded the rice-gathering.\n\nThere were social events which enlivened the camp of the harvesters;\nsuch as maidens’ feasts, dances and a canoe regatta or two, in which not\nonly the men were participants, but women and young girls as well.\n\nOn the appointed day all the canoes were carried to the shore and placed\nupon the water with prayer and propitiatory offerings. Each family took\npossession of the allotted field, and tied all the grain in bundles of\nconvenient size, allowing it to stand for a few days. Then they again\nentered the lake, assigning two persons to each canoe. One manipulated\nthe paddle, while the foremost one gently drew the heads of each bundle\ntoward him and gave it a few strokes with a light rod. This caused the\nrice to fall into the bottom of the craft. The field was traversed in\nthis manner back and forth until finished.\n\nThis was the pleasantest and easiest part of the harvest toil. The real\nwork was when they prepared the rice for use. First of all, it must be\nmade perfectly dry. They would spread it upon buffalo robes and mats,\nand sometimes upon layers of coarse swamp grass, and dry it in the sun.\nIf the time was short, they would make a scaffold and spread upon it a\ncertain thickness of the green grass and afterward the rice. Under this\na fire was made, taking care that the grass did not catch fire.\n\nWhen all the rice is gathered and dried, the hulling begins. A round\nhole is dug about two feet deep and the same in diameter. Then the rice\nis heated over a fire-place, and emptied into the hole while it is hot.\nA young man, having washed his feet and put on a new pair of moccasins,\ntreads upon it until all is hulled. The women then pour it upon a robe\nand begin to shake it so that the chaff will be separated by the wind.\nSome of the rice is browned before being hulled.\n\nDuring the hulling time there were prizes offered to the young men who\ncan hull quickest and best. There were sometimes from twenty to fifty\nyouths dancing with their feet in these holes.\n\nPretty moccasins were brought by shy maidens to the youths of their\nchoice, asking them to hull rice. There were daily entertainments which\ndeserved some such name as “hulling bee”--at any rate, we all enjoyed\nthem hugely. The girls brought with them plenty of good things to eat.\n\nWhen all the rice was prepared for the table, the matter of storing it\nmust be determined. Caches were dug by each family in a concealed\nspot, and carefully lined with dry grass and bark. Here they left their\nsurplus stores for a time of need. Our people were very ingenious in\ncovering up all traces of the hidden food. A common trick was to build\na fire on top of the mound. As much of the rice as could be carried\nconveniently was packed in par-fleches, or cases made of rawhide, and\nbrought back with us to our village.\n\nAfter all, the wild Indians could not be justly termed improvident, when\ntheir manner of life is taken into consideration. They let nothing go\nto waste, and labored incessantly during the summer and fall to lay\nup provision for the inclement season. Berries of all kinds were\nindustriously gathered, and dried in the sun. Even the wild cherries\nwere pounded up, stones and all, made into small cakes and dried for use\nin soups and for mixing with the pounded jerked meat and fat to form a\nmuch-prized Indian delicacy.\n\nOut on the prairie in July and August the women were wont to dig\nteepsinna with sharpened sticks, and many a bag full was dried and put\naway. This teepsinna is the root of a certain plant growing mostly upon\nhigh sandy soil. It is starchy but solid, with a sweetish taste, and is\nvery fattening. The fully grown teepsinna is two or three inches long,\nand has a dark-brown bark not unlike the bark of a young tree. It can be\neaten raw or stewed, and is always kept in a dried state, except when it\nis first dug.\n\nThere was another root that our people gathered in small quantities. It\nis a wild sweet potato, found in bottom lands or river beds.\n\nThe primitive housekeeper exerted herself much to secure a variety of\nappetizing dishes; she even robbed the field mouse and the muskrat to\naccomplish her end. The tiny mouse gathers for her winter use several\nexcellent kinds of food. Among these is a wild bean which equals in\nflavor any domestic bean that I have ever tasted. Her storehouse is\nusually under a peculiar mound, which the untrained eye would be unable\nto distinguish from an ant-hill. There are many pockets underneath, into\nwhich she industriously gathers the harvest of the summer.\n\nShe is fortunate if the quick eye of a native woman does not detect her\nhiding-place. About the month of September, while traveling over the\nprairie, a woman is occasionally observed to halt suddenly and waltz\naround a suspected mound. Finally the pressure of her heel causes a\nplace to give way, and she settles contentedly down to rob the poor\nmouse of the fruits of her labor.\n\nThe different kinds of beans are put away in different pockets, but\nit is the oomenechah she wants. The field mouse loves this savory\nvegetable, for she always gathers it more than any other. There is also\nsome of the white star-like manakcahkcah, the root of the wild lily.\nThis is a good medicine and good to eat.\n\nWhen our people were gathering the wild rice, they always watched for\nanother plant that grows in the muddy bottom of lakes and ponds. It is\na white bulb about the size of an ordinary onion. This is stored away\nby the muskrats in their houses by the waterside, and there is often a\nbushel or more of the psinchinchah to be found within. It seemed as if\neverybody was good to the wild Indian; at least we thought so then.\n\nI have referred to the opportunities for courting upon the wild rice\nfields. Indian courtship is very peculiar in many respects; but when you\nstudy their daily life you will see the philosophy of their etiquette\nof love-making. There was no parlor courtship; the life was largely\nout-of-doors, which was very favorable to the young men\n\nIn a nomadic life where the female members of the family have entire\ncontrol of domestic affairs, the work is divided among them all. Very\noften the bringing of the wood and water devolves upon the young maids,\nand the spring or the woods become the battle-ground of love’s warfare.\nThe nearest water may be some distance from the camp, which is all the\nbetter. Sometimes, too, there is no wood to be had; and in that case,\none would see the young women scattered all over the prairie, gathering\nbuffalo chips for fuel.\n\nThis is the way the red men go about to induce the aboriginal maids\nto listen to their suit. As soon as the youth has returned from the\nwar-path or the chase, he puts on his porcupine-quill embroidered\nmoccasins and leggings, and folds his best robe about him. He brushes\nhis long, glossy hair with a brush made from the tail of the porcupine,\nperfumes it with scented grass or leaves, then arranges it in two plaits\nwith an otter skin or some other ornament. If he is a warrior, he adds\nan eagle feather or two.\n\nIf he chooses to ride, he takes his best pony. He jumps upon its bare\nback, simply throwing a part of his robe under him to serve as a saddle,\nand holding the end of a lariat tied about the animal’s neck. He guides\nhim altogether by the motions of his body. These wily ponies seem to\nenter into the spirit of the occasion, and very often capture the eyes\nof the maid by their graceful movements, in perfect obedience to their\nmaster.\n\nThe general custom is for the young men to pull their robes over their\nheads, leaving only a slit to look through. Sometimes the same is done\nby the maiden--especially in public courtship.\n\nHe approaches the girl while she is coming from the spring. He takes up\nhis position directly in her path. If she is in a hurry or does not care\nto stop, she goes around him; but if she is willing to stop and listen\nshe puts down on the ground the vessel of water she is carrying.\n\nVery often at the first meeting the maiden does not know who her lover\nis. He does not introduce himself immediately, but waits until a second\nmeeting. Sometimes she does not see his face at all; and then she will\ntry to find out who he is and what he looks like before they meet again.\nIf he is not a desirable suitor, she will go with her chaperon and end\nthe affair there.\n\nThere are times when maidens go in twos, and then there must be two\nyoung men to meet them.\n\nThere is some courtship in the night time; either in the early part of\nthe evening, on the outskirts of dances and other public affairs, or\nafter everybody is supposed to be asleep. This is the secret courtship.\nThe youth may pull up the tentpins just back of his sweetheart and\nspeak with her during the night. He must be a smart young man to do that\nundetected, for the grandmother, her chaperon, is usually “all ears.”\n\nElopements are common. There are many reasons for a girl or a youth to\ndefer their wedding. It may be from personal pride of one or both. The\nwell-born are married publicly, and many things are given away in their\nhonor. The maiden may desire to attend a certain number of maidens’\nfeasts before marrying. The youth may be poor, or he may wish to achieve\nanother honor before surrendering to a woman.\n\nSometimes a youth is so infatuated with a maiden that he will follow\nher to any part of the country, even after their respective bands have\nseparated for the season. I knew of one such case. Patah Tankah had\ncourted a distant relative of my uncle for a long time. There seemed to\nbe some objection to him on the part of the girl’s parents, although the\ngirl herself was willing.\n\nThe large camp had been broken up for the fall hunt, and my uncle’s band\nwent one way, while the young man’s family went in the other direction.\nAfter three days’ travelling, we came to a good hunting-ground, and made\ncamp. One evening somebody saw the young man. He had been following his\nsweetheart and sleeping out-of-doors all that time, although the nights\nwere already frosty and cold. He met her every day in secret and she\nbrought him food, but he would not come near the teepee. Finally her\npeople yielded, and she went back with him to his band.\n\nWhen we lived our natural life, there was much singing of war songs,\nmedicine, hunting and love songs. Sometimes there were few words or\nnone, but everything was understood by the inflection. From this I have\noften thought that there must be a language of dumb beasts.\n\nThe crude musical instrument of the Sioux, the flute, was made to appeal\nto the susceptible ears of the maidens late into the night. There comes\nto me now the picture of two young men with their robes over their\nheads, and only a portion of the hand-made and carved chotanka, the\nflute, protruding from its folds. I can see all the maidens slyly turn\ntheir heads to listen. Now I hear one of the youths begin to sing a\nplaintive serenade as in days gone by:\n\n\n    “Hay-ay-ay! Hay-ay-ay! a-ahay-ay!” (This\n    “Listen! you will hear of him--\n     Maiden, you will hear of him--\n     Listen! he will shortly go\n\nWasula feels that she must come out, but she has no good excuse, so she\nstirs up the embers of the fire and causes an unnecessary smoke in the\nteepee. Then she has an excuse to come out and fix up the tent flaps.\nShe takes a long time to adjust these pointed ears of the teepee, with\ntheir long poles, for the wind seems to be unsettled.\n\nFinally Chotanka ceases to be heard. In a moment a young man appears\nghost-like at the maiden’s side.\n\n“So it is you, is it?” she asks.\n\n“Is your grandmother in?” he inquires.\n\n“What a brave man you are, to fear an old woman! We are free; the\ncountry is wide. We can go away, and come back when the storm is over.”\n\n“Ho,” he replies. “It is not that I fear her, or the consequences of an\nelopement. I fear nothing except that we may be separated!”\n\nThe girl goes into the lodge for a moment, then slips out once more.\n“Now,” she exclaims, “to the wood or the prairie! I am yours!” They\ndisappear in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nIV. A Meeting on the Plains\n\nWE were encamped at one time on the Souris or Mouse river, a tributary\nof the Assiniboine. The buffaloes were still plenty; hence we were\nliving on the “fat of the land.” One afternoon a scout came in with the\nannouncement that a body of United States troops was approaching! This\nreport, of course, caused much uneasiness among our people.\n\nA council was held immediately, in the course of which the scout was put\nthrough a rigid examination. Before a decision had been reached, another\nscout came in from the field. He declared that the moving train reported\nas a body of troops was in reality a train of Canadian carts.\n\nThe two reports differed so widely that it was deemed wise to send\nout more runners to observe this moving body closely, and ascertain\ndefinitely its character. These soon returned with the positive\ninformation that the Canadians were at hand, “for,” said they, “there\nare no bright metals in the moving train to send forth flashes of light.\nThe separate bodies are short, like carts with ponies, and not like the\nlong, four-wheeled wagon drawn by four or six mules, that the soldiers\nuse. They are not buffaloes, and they cannot be mounted troops, with\npack-mules, because the individual bodies are too long for that.\nBesides, the soldiers usually have their chief, with his guards, leading\nthe train; and the little chiefs are also separated from the main body\nand ride at one side!”\n\nFrom these observations it was concluded that we were soon to meet with\nthe bois brules, as the French call their mixed-bloods, presumably from\nthe color of their complexions. Some say that they are named from the\n“burned forests” which, as wood-cutters, they are accustomed to leave\nbehind them. Two or three hours later, at about sunset, our ears began\nto distinguish the peculiar music that always accompanied a moving train\nof their carts. It is like the grunting and squealing of many animals,\nand is due to the fact that the wheels and all other parts of these\nvehicles are made of wood. Our dogs gleefully augmented the volume of\ninharmonious sound.\n\nThey stopped a little way from our camp, upon a grassy plain, and the\nponies were made to wheel their clumsy burdens into a perfect\ncircle, the shafts being turned inward. Thus was formed a sort of\nbarricade--quite a usual and necessary precaution in their nomadic and\nadventurous life. Within this circle the tents were pitched, and many\ncheerful fires were soon kindled. The garcons were hurriedly driving\nthe ponies to water, with much cracking of whips and outbursting of\nimpatient oaths.\n\nOur chief and his principal warriors briefly conferred with the\nstrangers, and it was understood by both parties that no thought of\nhostilities lurked in the minds of either.\n\nAfter having observed the exchange of presents that always follows\na “peace council,” there were friendly and hospitable feasts in both\ncamps. The bois brules had been long away from any fort or trading-post,\nand it so happened that their inevitable whiskey keg was almost empty.\nThey had diluted the few gills remaining with several large kettles full\nof water. In order to have any sort of offensive taste, it was necessary\nto add cayenne pepper and a little gentian.\n\nOur men were treated to this concoction; and seeing that two or three\nof the half-breeds pretended to become intoxicated, our braves followed\ntheir example. They made night intolerable with their shouts and singing\nuntil past midnight, when gradually all disturbance ceased, and both\ncamps appeared to be wrapped in deep slumber.\n\nSuddenly the loud report of a gun stirred the sleepers. Many more\nreports were heard in quick succession, all coming from the camp of the\nbois brules. Every man among the Sioux sprang to his feet, weapon in\nhand, and many ran towards their ponies. But there was one significant\npoint about the untimely firing of the guns--they were all directed\nheavenward! One of our old men, who understood better than any one else\nthe manners of the half-breeds, thus proclaimed at the top of his voice:\n\n“Let the people sleep! This that we have heard is the announcement of\na boy’s advent into the world! It is their custom to introduce with\ngunpowder a new-born boy!”\n\nAgain quiet was restored in the neighboring camps, and for a time the\nnight reigned undisturbed. But scarcely had we fallen into a sound sleep\nwhen we were for the second time rudely aroused by the firing of guns\nand the yelling of warriors. This time it was discovered that almost all\nthe ponies, including those of our neighbors, had been stealthily driven\noff by horse-thieves of another tribe.\n\nThese miscreants were adepts in their profession, for they had\naccomplished their purpose with much skill, almost under the very eyes\nof the foe, and had it not been for the invincible superstition of Slow\nDog, they would have met with complete success. As it was, they caused\nus no little trouble and anxiety, but after a hot pursuit of a whole\nday, with the assistance of the halfbreeds our horses were recaptured.\n\nSlow Dog was one of those Indians who are filled with conceit, and\nboasting loudly their pretensions as medicine men, without any success,\nonly bring upon themselves an unnecessary amount of embarrassment and\nridicule. Yet there is one quality always possessed by such persons,\namong a savage people as elsewhere--namely, great perseverance and\ntenacity in their self-assertion. So the blessing of ignorance kept Slow\nDog always cheerful; and he seemed, if anything, to derive some pleasure\nfrom the endless insinuations and ridicule of the people!\n\nNow Slow Dog had loudly proclaimed, on the night before this event, that\nhe had received the warning of a bad dream, in which he had seen all the\nponies belonging to the tribe stampeded and driven westward.\n\n“But who cares for Slow Dog’s dream?” said everybody; “none of the\nreally great medicine men have had any such visions!”\n\nTherefore our little community, given as they were to superstition,\nanticipated no special danger. It is true that when the first scout\nreported the approach of troops some of the people had weakened, and\nsaid to one another:\n\n“After all, perhaps poor Slow Dog may be right; but we are always too\nready to laugh at him!”\n\nHowever, this feeling quickly passed away when the jovial Canadians\narrived, and the old man was left alone to brood upon his warning.\n\nHe was faithful to his dream. During all the hilarity of the feast and\nthe drinking of the mock whiskey, be acted as self-constituted sentinel.\nFinally, when everybody else had succumbed to sleep, he gathered\ntogether several broken and discarded lariats of various\nmaterials--leather, buffalo’s hair and horse’s hair. Having lengthened\nthis variegated rope with innumerable knots, he fastened one end of it\naround the neck of his old war-horse, and tied the other to his wrist.\nInstead of sleeping inside the tent as usual, he rolled himself in a\nbuffalo robe and lay down in its shadow. From this place he watched\nuntil the moon had disappeared behind the western horizon; and just as\nthe grey dawn began to appear in the east his eyes were attracted to\nwhat seemed to be a dog moving among the picketed ponies. Upon a closer\nscrutiny, he saw that its actions were unnatural.\n\n“Toka abe do! toka abe do!” (the enemy! the enemy!) exclaimed Slow Dog.\nWith a warwhoop he sprang toward the intruder, who rose up and leaped\nupon the back of Slow Dog’s warsteed. He had cut the hobble, as well as\nthe device of the old medicine man.\n\nThe Sioux now bent his bow to shoot, but it was too late. The other\nquickly dodged behind the animal, and from under its chest he sent a\ndeadly arrow to Slow Dog’s bosom. Then he remounted the pony and set off\nat full speed after his comrades, who had already started.\n\nAs the Sioux braves responded to the alarm, and passed by the daring old\nwarrior in pursuit of their enemies, who had stampeded most of the loose\nponies, the old man cried out:\n\n“I, brave Slow Dog, who have so often made a path for you on the field\nof battle, am now about to make one to the land of spirits!”\n\nSo speaking, the old man died. The Sioux were joined in the chase by the\nfriendly mixedbloods, and in the end the Blackfeet were compelled to pay\ndearly for the blood of the poor old man.\n\nOn that beautiful morning all Nature seemed brilliant and smiling, but\nthe Sioux were mourning and wailing for the death of one who had been\nan object of ridicule during most of his life. They appreciated the part\nthat Slow Dog had played in this last event, and his memory was honored\nby all the tribe.\n\n\n\n\nV. An Adventurous Journey\n\nIT must now be about thirty years since our long journey in search of\nnew hunting-grounds, from the Assiniboine river to the Upper Missouri.\nThe buffalo, formerly so abundant between the two rivers, had begun to\nshun their usual haunts, on account of the great numbers of Canadian\nhalfbreeds in that part of the country. There was also the first influx\nof English sportsmen, whose wholesale methods of destruction wrought\nsuch havoc with the herds. These seemingly intelligent animals correctly\nprophesied to the natives the approach of the pale-face.\n\nAs we had anticipated, we found game very scarce as we travelled slowly\nacross the vast plains. There were only herds of antelope and sometimes\nflocks of waterfowl, with here and there a lonely bull straggling\naimlessly along. At first our party was small, but as we proceeded\non our way we fell in with some of the western bands of Sioux and\nAssiniboines, who are close connections.\n\nEach day the camp was raised and marched from ten to twenty miles.\nOne might wonder how such a cavalcade would look in motion. The only\nvehicles were the primitive travaux drawn by ponies and large Esquimaux\ndogs. These are merely a pair of shafts fastened on either side of the\nanimal, and trailing on the ground behind. A large basket suspended\nbetween the poles, just above the ground, supplied a place for goods and\na safe nest for the babies, or an occasional helpless old woman. Most of\nour effects were carried by pack ponies; and an Indian packer excels all\nothers in quickness and dexterity.\n\nThe train was nearly a mile long, headed by a number of old warriors on\nfoot, who carried the filled pipe, and decided when and where to stop.\nA very warm day made much trouble for the women who had charge of the\nmoving household. The pack dogs were especially unmanageable. They\nwould become very thirsty and run into the water with their loads. The\nscolding of the women, the singing of the old men and the yelps of the\nIndian dudes made our progress a noisy one, and like that of a town in\nmotion rather than an ordinary company of travelers.\n\nThis journey of ours was not without its exciting episodes. My uncle had\nleft the main body and gone off to the south with a small party, as he\nwas accustomed to do every summer, to seek revenge of some sort on the\nwhites for all the injuries that they had inflicted upon our family.\nThis time he met with a company of soldiers between Fort Totten and Fort\nBerthold, in North Dakota. Somehow, these seven Indians surprised the\ntroopers in broad daylight, while eating their dinner, and captured the\nwhole outfit, including nearly all their mules and one white horse, with\nsuch of their provisions as they cared to carry back with them. No doubt\nthese soldiers reported at the fort that they had been attacked by a\nlarge party of Indians, and I dare say some promotions rewarded their\ntale of a brave defense! However, the facts are just as I have stated\nthem. My uncle brought home the white horse, and the fine Spanish mules\nwere taken by the others. Among the things they brought back with them\nwere several loaves of raised bread, the first I had ever seen, and a\ngreat curiosity. We called it aguyape tachangu, or lung bread, from its\nspongy consistency.\n\nAlthough when a successful war-party returns with so many trophies,\nthere is usually much dancing and hilarity, there was almost nothing\nof the kind on this occasion. The reason was that the enemy made little\nresistance; and then there was our old tradition with regard to the\nwhites that there is no honor in conquering them, as they fight only\nunder compulsion. Had there really been a battle, and some of our men\nbeen killed, there would have been some enthusiasm.\n\nIt was upon this journey that a hunter performed the feat of shooting\nan arrow through three antelopes. This statement may perhaps be doubted,\nyet I can vouch for its authenticity. He was not alone at the time, and\nthose who were with him are reliable witnesses. The animals were driven\nupon a marshy peninsula, where they were crowded together and almost\nhelpless. Many were despatched with knives and arrows; and a man by the\nname of Grey-foot, who was large and tall and an extraordinarily fine\nhunter, actually sent his arrow through three of them. This feat was not\naccomplished by mere strength, for it requires a great deal of skill as\nwell.\n\nA misfortune occurred near the river which deprived us of one of our\nbest young men. There was no other man, except my own uncle, for whom I\nhad at that time so great an admiration. Very strangely, as it appeared\nto me, he bore a Christian name. He was commonly called Jacob. I did not\ndiscover how he came by such a curious and apparently meaningless name\nuntil after I had returned to the United States. His father had been\nconverted by one of the early missionaries, before the Minnesota\nmassacre in 1862, and the boy had been baptized Jacob. He was an ideal\nwoodsman and hunter and really a hero in my eyes. He was one of the\nparty of seven who had attacked and put to rout the white soldiers.\n\nThe trouble arose thus. Jacob had taken from the soldiers two good\nmules, and soon afterward we fell in with some Canadian half-breeds\nwho were desirous of trading for them. However, the young man would not\ntrade; he was not at all disposed to part with his fine mules. A certain\none of the mixed-bloods was intent upon getting possession of these\nanimals by fair or unfair means. He invited Jacob to dinner, and treated\nhim to whiskey; but the Indian youth declined the liquor. The half-breed\npretended to take this refusal to drink as an insult. He seized his gun\nand shot his guest dead.\n\nIn a few minutes the scene was one of almost unprecedented excitement.\nEvery adult Indian, female as well as male, was bent upon invading the\ncamp of the bois brules, to destroy the murderer. The confusion was\nmade yet more intolerable by the wailing of the women and the singing of\ndeath-songs.\n\nOur number was now ten to one of the halfbreeds. Within the circle\nformed by their carts they prepared for a desperate resistance. The\nhills about their little encampment were covered with warriors, ready to\npounce upon them at the signal of their chief.\n\nThe older men, however, were discussing in council what should be\ndemanded of the halfbreeds. It was determined that the murderer must be\ngiven up to us, to be punished according to the laws of the plains. If,\nhowever, they should refuse to give him up, the mode of attack decided\nupon was to build a fire around the offenders and thus stampede their\nhorses, or at the least divide their attention. Meanwhile, the braves\nwere to make a sudden onset.\n\nJust then a piece of white, newly-tanned deerskin was hoisted up in\nthe center of the bois brule encampment. It was a flag of truce. One of\ntheir number approached the council lodge, unarmed and making the sign\nfor a peaceful communication. He was admitted to the council, which\nwas still in session, and offered to give up the murderer. It was also\nproposed, as an alternative, that he be compelled to give everything he\nhad to the parents of the murdered man.\n\nThe parents were allowed no voice whatever in the discussion which\nfollowed, for they were regarded as incompetent judges, under the\ncircumstances. It was finally decreed by the council that the man’s\nlife should be spared, but that he must be exposed to the indignity of\na public whipping, and resign all his earthly possessions to the parents\nof his victim. This sentence was carried into effect.\n\nIn our nomadic life there were a few unwritten laws by which our people\nwere governed. There was a council, a police force, and an executive\nofficer, who was not always the chief, but a member of the tribe\nappointed to this position for a given number of days. There were also\nthe wise old men who were constantly in attendance at the council lodge,\nand acted as judges in the rare event of the commission of a crime.\n\nThis simple government of ours was supported by the issue of little\nsticks about five inches long. There were a hundred or so of these, and\nthey were distributed every few days by the police or soldiers, who kept\naccount of them. Whoever received one of these sticks must return it\nwithin five or ten days, with a load of provisions. If one was held\nbeyond the stipulated time the police would call the delinquent warrior\nto account. In case he did not respond, they could come and destroy his\ntent or take away his weapons. When all the sticks had been returned,\nthey were reissued to other men; and so the council lodge was supported.\n\nIt was the custom that no man who had not distinguished himself upon\nthe war-path could destroy the home of another. This was a necessary\nqualification for the office of an Indian policeman. These policemen\nmust also oversee the hunt, lest some individuals should be well\nprovided with food while others were in want. No man might hunt\nindependently. The game must be carefully watched by the game scouts,\nand the discovery of a herd reported at once to the council, after which\nthe time and manner of the hunt were publicly announced.\n\nI well recall how the herald announced the near approach of buffaloes.\nIt was supposed that if the little boys could trip up the old man while\ngoing his rounds, the success of the hunt was assured. The oftener he\nwas tripped, the more successful it would be! The signal or call for\nbuffaloes was a peculiar whistle. As soon as the herald appeared, all\nthe boys would give the whistle and follow in crowds after the poor old\nman. Of course he tried to avoid them, but they were generally too quick\nfor him.\n\nThere were two kinds of scouts, for hunting and for war. In one sense\nevery Indian was a scout; but there were some especially appointed to\nserve for a certain length of time. An Indian might hunt every day,\nbesides the regularly organized hunt; but he was liable to punishment at\nany time. If he could kill a solitary buffalo or deer without disturbing\nthe herd, it was allowed. He might also hunt small game.\n\nIn the movable town under such a government as this, there was apt to\nbe inconvenience and actual suffering, since a great body of people were\nsupported only by the daily hunt. Hence there was a constant disposition\nto break up into smaller parties, in order to obtain food more easily\nand freely. Yet the wise men of the Dakotas would occasionally form\nlarge bands of from two to five thousand people, who camped and moved\nabout together for a period of some months. It is apparent that so large\na body could not be easily supplied with the necessaries of life; but,\non the other hand, our enemies respected such a gathering! Of course\nthe nomadic government would do its utmost to hold together as long as\npossible. The police did all they could to keep in check those parties\nwho were intent upon stealing away.\n\nThere were many times, however, when individual bands and even families\nwere justified in seeking to separate themselves from the rest, in order\nto gain a better support. It was chiefly by reason of this food\nquestion that the Indians never established permanent towns or organized\nthemselves into a more formidable nation.\n\nThere was a sad misfortune which, although it happened many generations\nago, was familiarly quoted among us. A certain band became very\nindependent and unruly; they went so far as to wilfully disobey the\norders of the general government. The police were directed to punish\nthe leader severely; whereupon the rest defended him and resisted the\npolice. But the latter were competent to enforce their authority, and as\na result the entire band was annihilated.\n\nOne day, as we were following along the bank of the Upper Missouri,\nthere appeared to be a great disturbance at the head of the\ncavalcade--so much so that we thought our people had been attacked by a\nwar-party of the Crows or some of the hostile tribes of that region. In\nspite of the danger, even the women and children hurried forward to join\nthe men--that is to say, as many as were not upon the hunt. Most of the\nwarriors were out, as usual, and only the large boys and the old men\nwere travelling with the women and their domestic effects and little\nones.\n\nAs we approached the scene of action, we heard loud shouts and\nthe report of fire-arms; but our party was scattered along for a\nconsiderable distance, and all was over before we could reach the\nspot. It was a great grizzly bear who had been bold enough to oppose,\nsingle-handed, the progress of several hundred Indians. The council-men,\nwho usually walked a little in advance of the train, were the first to\nmeet the bear, and he was probably deceived by the sight of this advance\nbody, and thus audaciously defied them.\n\nAmong these council-men--all retired chiefs and warriors whose ardent\nzeal for the display of courage had long been cooled, and whose present\nduties were those of calm deliberation for their people’s welfare--there\nwere two old, distinguished war-chiefs. Each of these men still carried\nhis war-lance, wrapped up in decorated buckskin. As the bear advanced\nboldly toward them, the two old men promptly threw off their robes--an\nevidence that there still lurked within their breasts the spirit of\nchivalry and ready courage. Spear in hand, they both sprang forward to\ncombat with the ferocious animal, taking up their positions about ten\nfeet apart.\n\nAs they had expected, the fearful beast, after getting up on his\nhaunches and growling savagely, came forward with widely opened jaws.\nHe fixed his eyes upon the left-hand man, who was ready to meet him with\nuplifted spear, but with one stroke of his powerful paw the weapon was\nsent to the ground. At the same moment the right-hand man dealt him a\nstab that penetrated the grizzly’s side.\n\nThe bear uttered a groan not unlike that of a man, and seized the spear\nso violently that its owner was thrown to the ground. As the animal\ndrew the lance from its body, the first man, having recovered his own,\nstabbed him with it on the other side. Upon this, he turned and knocked\nthe old man down, and again endeavored to extract the spear.\n\nBy this time all the dogs and men were at hand. Many arrows and balls\nwere sent into the tough hide of the bear. Yet he would probably have\nkilled both his assailants, had it not been for the active small dogs\nwho were constantly upon his heels and annoying him. A deadly rifle shot\nat last brought him down.\n\nThe old men were badly bruised and torn, but both of them recovered,\nto bear from that day the high-sounding titles of “Fought-the-Bear” and\n“Conquered-the-Grizzly.”\n\n\n\n\nXI. The Laughing Philosopher\n\nTHERE is scarcely anything so exasperating to me as the idea that the\nnatives of this country have no sense of humor and no faculty for mirth.\nThis phase of their character is well understood by those whose fortune\nor misfortune it has been to live among them day in and day out at their\nhomes. I don’t believe I ever heard a real hearty laugh away from the\nIndians’ fireside. I have often spent an entire evening in laughing with\nthem until I could laugh no more. There are evenings when the recognized\nwit or story-teller of the village gives a free entertainment which\nkeeps the rest of the community in a convulsive state until he leaves\nthem. However, Indian humor consists as much in the gestures and\ninflections of the voice as in words, and is really untranslatable.\n\nMatogee (Yellow Bear) was a natural humorous speaker, and a very\ndiffident man at other times. He usually said little, but when he was\nin the mood he could keep a large company in a roar. This was especially\nthe case whenever he met his brother-in-law, Tamedokah.\n\nIt was a custom with us Indians to joke more particularly with our\nbrothers- and sisters-in-law. But no one ever complained, or resented\nany of these jokes, however personal they might be. That would be an\nunpardonable breach of etiquette.\n\n“Tamedokah, I heard that you tried to capture a buck by holding on\nto his tail,” said Matogee, laughing. “I believe that feat cannot be\nperformed any more; at least, it never has been since the pale-face\nbrought us the knife, the ‘mysterious iron,’ and the pulverized coal\nthat makes bullets fly. Since our ancestors hunted with stone knives and\nhatchets, I say, that has never been done.”\n\nThe fact was that Tamedokah had stunned a buck that day while hunting,\nand as he was about to dress him the animal got up and attempted to\nrun, whereupon the Indian launched forth to secure his game. He only\nsucceeded in grasping the tail of the deer, and was pulled about all\nover the meadows and the adjacent woods until the tail came off in his\nhands. Matogee thought this too good a joke to be lost.\n\nI sat near the door of the tent, and thoroughly enjoyed the story of the\ncomical accident.\n\n“Yes,” Tamedokah quietly replied, “I thought I would do something to\nbeat the story of the man who rode a young elk, and yelled frantically\nfor help, crying like a woman.”\n\n“Ugh! that was only a legend,” retorted Matogee, for it was he who was\nthe hero of this tale in his younger days. “But this is a fresh feat of\nto-day. Chankpayuhah said he could not tell which was the most scared,\nthe buck or you,” he continued. “He said the deer’s eyes were bulging\nout of their sockets, while Tamedokah’s mouth was constantly enlarging\ntoward his ears, and his hair floated on the wind, shaking among the\nbranches of the trees. That will go down with the traditions of our\nfathers,” he concluded with an air of satisfaction.\n\n“It was a singular mishap,” admitted Tamedokah.\n\nThe pipe had been filled by Matogee and passed to Tamedokah\ngood-naturedly, still with a broad smile on his face. “It must be\nacknowledged,” he resumed, “that you have the strongest kind of a grip,\nfor no one else could hold on as long as you did, and secure such a\ntrophy besides. That tail will do for an eagle feather holder.”\n\nBy this time the teepee was packed to overflowing. Loud laughter had\nbeen heard issuing from the lodge of Matogee, and everybody suspected\nthat he had something good, so many had come to listen.\n\n“I think we should hear the whole matter,” said one of the late comers.\n\nThe teepee was brightly lit by the burning embers, and all the men were\nsitting with their knees up against their chests, held in that position\nby wrapping their robes tightly around loins and knees. This fixed them\nsomething in the fashion of a rocking-chair.\n\n“Well, no one saw him except Chankpayuhah,” Matogee remarked.\n\n“Yes, yes, he must tell us about it,” exclaimed a chorus of voices.\n\n“This is what I saw,” the witness began. “I was tracking a buck and a\ndoe. As I approached a small opening at the creek side ‘boom!’ came a\nreport of the mysterious iron. I remained in a stooping position, hoping\nto see a deer cross the opening. In this I was not disappointed, for\nimmediately after the report a fine buck dashed forth with Tamedokah\nclose behind him. The latter was holding on to the deer’s tail with\nboth hands and his knife was in his mouth, but it soon dropped out.\n‘Tamedokah,’ I shouted, ‘haven’t you got hold of the wrong animal?’ but\nas I spoke they disappeared into the woods.\n\n“In a minute they both appeared again, and then it was that I began\nto laugh. I could not stop. It almost killed me. The deer jumped the\nlongest jumps I ever saw. Tamedokah walked the longest paces and was\nvery swift. His hair was whipping the trees as they went by. Water\npoured down his face. I stood bent forward because I could not\nstraighten my back-bone, and was ready to fall when they again\ndisappeared.\n\n“When they came out for the third time it seemed as if the woods and the\nmeadow were moving too. Tamedokah skipped across the opening as if he\nwere a grasshopper learning to hop. I fell down.\n\n“When I came to he was putting water on my face and head, but when I\nlooked at him I fell again, and did not know anything until the sun had\npassed the mid-sky.\n\n“The company was kept roaring all the way through this account, while\nTamedokah himself heartily joined in the mirth.\n\n“Ho, ho, ho!” they said; “he has made his name famous in our annals.\nThis will be told of him henceforth.”\n\n“It reminds me of Chadozee’s bear story,” said one.\n\n“His was more thrilling, because it was really dangerous,” interposed\nanother.\n\n“You can tell it to us, Bobdoo,” remarked a third.\n\nThe man thus addressed made no immediate reply. He was smoking\ncontentedly. At last he silently returned the pipe to Matogee, with whom\nit had begun its rounds. Deliberately he tightened his robe around him,\nsaying as he did so:\n\n“Ho (Yes). I was with him. It was by a very little that he saved his\nlife. I will tell you how it happened.\n\n“I was hunting with these two men, Nageedah and Chadozee. We came to\nsome wild cherry bushes. I began to eat of the fruit when I saw a large\nsilver-tip crawling toward us. ‘Look out! there is a grizzly here,’ I\nshouted, and I ran my pony out on to the prairie; but the others had\nalready dismounted.\n\n“Nageedah had just time to jump upon his pony and get out of the way,\nbut the bear seized hold of his robe and pulled it off. Chadozee\nstood upon the verge of a steep bank, below which there ran a deep and\nswift-flowing stream. The bear rushed upon him so suddenly that when he\ntook a step backward, they both fell into the creek together. It was a\nfall of about twice the height of a man.”\n\n“Did they go out of sight?” some one inquired.\n\n“Yes, both fell headlong. In his excitement Chadozee laid hold of the\nbear in the water, and I never saw a bear try so hard to get away from a\nman as this one did.”\n\n“Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!” they all laughed.\n\n“When they came to the surface again they were both so eager to get to\nthe shore that each let go, and they swam as quickly as they could to\nopposite sides. Chadozee could not get any further, so he clung to a\nstray root, still keeping a close watch of the bear, who was forced to\ndo the same. There they both hung, regarding each other with looks of\ncontempt and defiance.”\n\n“Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!” they all laughed again.\n\n“At last the bear swam along the edge to a lower place, and we pulled\nChadozee up by means of our lariats. All this time he had been groaning\nso loud that we supposed he was badly torn; but when I looked for his\nwounds I found a mere scratch.”\n\nAgain the chorus of appreciation from his hearers.\n\n“The strangest thing about this affair of mine,” spoke up Tamedokah, “is\nthat I dreamed the whole thing the night before.”\n\n“There are some dreams come true, and I am a believer in dreams,” one\nremarked.\n\n“Yes, certainly, so are we all. You know Hachah almost lost his life by\nbelieving in dreams,” commented Matogee.\n\n“Let us hear that story,” was the general request.\n\n“You have all heard of Hachah, the great medicine man, who did many\nwonderful things. He once dreamed four nights in succession of flying\nfrom a high cliff over the Minnesota river. He recollected every\nparticular of the scene, and it made a great impression upon his mind.\n\n“The next day after he had dreamed it for the fourth time, he proposed\nto his wife that they go down to the river to swim, but his real purpose\nwas to see the place of his dream.\n\n“He did find the place, and it seemed to Hachah exactly like. A crooked\ntree grew out of the top of the cliff, and the water below was very\ndeep.”\n\n“Did he really fly?” I called impatiently from the doorway, where I had\nbeen listening and laughing with the rest.\n\n“Ugh, that is what I shall tell you. He was swimming about with his\nwife, who was a fine swimmer; but all at once Hachah disappeared.\nPresently he stood upon the very tree that he had seen in his dream,\nand gazed out over the water. The tree was very springy, and Hachah felt\nsure that he could fly; so before long he launched bravely forth from\nthe cliff. He kicked out vigorously and swung both arms as he did so,\nbut nevertheless he came down to the bottom of the water like a crow\nthat had been shot on the wing.”\n\n“Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!” and the whole company laughed unreservedly.\n\n“His wife screamed loudly as Hachah whirled downward and went out\nof sight like a blue heron after a fish. Then she feared he might be\nstunned, so she swam to him and dragged him to the shore. He could not\nspeak, but the woman overwhelmed him with reproaches.\n\n“‘What are you trying to do, you old idiot? Do you want to kill\nyourself?’ she screamed again and again.\n\n“‘Woman, be silent,’ he replied, and he said nothing more. He did not\ntell his dream for many years afterward. Not until he was a very old man\nand about to die, did Hachah tell any one how he thought he could fly.”\n\nAnd at this they all laughed louder than ever.\n\n\n\n\nXII. FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF CIVILIZATION\n\nI WAS scarcely old enough to know anything definite about the “Big\nKnives,” as we called the white men, when the terrible Minnesota\nmassacre broke up our home and I was carried into exile. I have already\ntold how I was adopted into the family of my father’s younger brother,\nwhen my father was betrayed and imprisoned. We all supposed that he had\nshared the fate of those who were executed at Mankato, Minnesota.\n\nNow the savage philosophers looked upon vengeance in the field of battle\nas a lofty virtue. To avenge the death of a relative or of a dear friend\nwas considered a great deed. My uncle, accordingly, had spared no pains\nto instill into my young mind the obligation to avenge the death of my\nfather and my older brothers. Already I looked eagerly forward to\nthe day when I should find an opportunity to carry out his teachings.\nMeanwhile, he himself went upon the war-path and returned with scalps\nevery summer. So it may be imagined how I felt toward the Big Knives!\n\nOn the other hand, I had heard marvelous things of this people. In\nsome things we despised them; in others we regarded them as wakan\n(mysterious), a race whose power bordered upon the supernatural. I\nlearned that they had made a “fireboat.” I could not understand how\nthey could unite two elements which cannot exist together. I thought the\nwater would put out the fire, and the fire would consume the boat if\nit had the shadow of a chance. This was to me a preposterous\nthing! But when I was told that the Big Knives had created a\n“fire-boat-walks-on-mountains” (a locomotive) it was too much to\nbelieve.\n\n“Why,” declared my informant, “those who saw this monster move said that\nit flew from mountain to mountain when it seemed to be excited. They\nsaid also that they believed it carried a thunder-bird, for they\nfrequently heard his usual war-whoop as the creature sped along!”\n\nSeveral warriors had observed from a distance one of the first trains\non the Northern Pacific, and had gained an exaggerated impression of the\nwonders of the pale-face. They had seen it go over a bridge that spanned\na deep ravine and it seemed to them that it jumped from one bank to the\nother. I confess that the story almost quenched my ardor and bravery.\n\nTwo or three young men were talking together about this fearful\ninvention.\n\n“However,” said one, “I understand that this\nfire-boat-walks-on-mountains cannot move except on the track made for\nit.”\n\nAlthough a boy is not expected to join in the conversation of his\nelders, I ventured to ask: “Then it cannot chase us into any rough\ncountry?”\n\n“No, it cannot do that,” was the reply, which I heard with a great deal\nof relief.\n\nI had seen guns and various other things brought to us by the French\nCanadians, so that I had already some notion of the supernatural gifts\nof the white man; but I had never before heard such tales as I listened\nto that morning. It was said that they had bridged the Missouri and\nMississippi rivers, and that they made immense houses of stone and\nbrick, piled on top of one another until they were as high as high\nhills. My brain was puzzled with these things for many a day. Finally\nI asked my uncle why the Great Mystery gave such power to the Washechu\n(the rich)-sometimes we called them by this name--and not to us Dakotas.\n\n“For the same reason,” he answered, “that he gave to Duta the skill to\nmake fine bows and arrows, and to Wachesne no skill to make anything.”\n\n“And why do the Big Knives increase so much more in number than the\nDakotas?” I continued.\n\n“It has been said, and I think it must be true, that they have larger\nfamilies than we do. I went into the house of an Eashecha (a German),\nand I counted no less than nine children. The eldest of them could not\nhave been over fifteen. When my grandfather first visited them, down\nat the mouth of the Mississippi, they were comparatively few; later my\nfather visited their Great Father at Washington, and they had already\nspread over the whole country.”\n\n“Certainly they are a heartless nation. They have made some of their\npeople servants--yes, slaves! We have never believed in keeping slaves,\nbut it seems that these Washechu do! It is our belief that they painted\ntheir servants black a long time ago, to tell them from the rest, and\nnow the slaves have children born to them of the same color!\n\n“The greatest object of their lives seems to be to acquire\npossessions--to be rich. They desire to possess the whole world. For\nthirty years they were trying to entice us to sell them our land.\nFinally the outbreak gave them all, and we have been driven away from\nour beautiful country.\n\n“They are a wonderful people. They have divided the day into hours, like\nthe moons of the year. In fact, they measure everything. Not one of them\nwould let so much as a turnip go from his field unless he received full\nvalue for it. I understand that their great men make a feast and invite\nmany, but when the feast is over the guests are required to pay for what\nthey have eaten before leaving the house. I myself saw at White Cliff\n(the name given to St. Paul, Minnesota) a man who kept a brass drum and\na bell to call people to his table; but when he got them in he would\nmake them pay for the food!\n\n“I am also informed,” said my uncle, “but this I hardly believe, that\ntheir Great Chief (President) compels every man to pay him for the\nland he lives upon and all his personal goods--even for his own\nexistence--every year!” (This was his idea of taxation.) “I am sure we\ncould not live under such a law.\n\n“When the outbreak occurred, we thought that our opportunity had come,\nfor we had learned that the Big Knives were fighting among themselves,\non account of a dispute over their slaves. It was said that the Great\nChief had allowed slaves in one part of the country and not in another,\nso there was jealousy, and they had to fight it out. We don’t know how\ntrue this was.\n\n“There were some praying-men who came to us some time before the trouble\narose. They observed every seventh day as a holy day. On that day they\nmet in a house that they had built for that purpose, to sing, pray, and\nspeak of their Great Mystery. I was never in one of these meetings.\nI understand that they had a large book from which they read. By all\naccounts they were very different from all other white men we have\nknown, for these never observed any such day, and we never knew them to\npray, neither did they ever tell us of their Great Mystery.\n\n“In war they have leaders and war-chiefs of different grades. The common\nwarriors are driven forward like a herd of antelopes to face the foe. It\nis on account of this manner of fighting--from compulsion and not from\npersonal bravery--that we count no coup on them. A lone warrior can do\nmuch harm to a large army of them in a bad country.”\n\nIt was this talk with my uncle that gave me my first clear idea of the\nwhite man.\n\nI was almost fifteen years old when my uncle presented me with a\nflint-lock gun. The possession of the “mysterious iron,” and the\nexplosive dirt, or “pulverized coal,” as it is called, filled me with\nnew thoughts. All the war-songs that I had ever heard from childhood\ncame back to me with their heroes. It seemed as if I were an entirely\nnew being--the boy had become a man!\n\n“I am now old enough,” said I to myself, “and I must beg my uncle to\ntake me with him on his next war-path. I shall soon be able to go among\nthe whites whenever I wish, and to avenge the blood of my father and my\nbrothers.”\n\nI had already begun to invoke the blessing of the Great Mystery.\nScarcely a day passed that I did not offer up some of my game, so that\nhe might not be displeased with me. My people saw very little of me\nduring the day, for in solitude I found the strength I needed. I groped\nabout in the wilderness, and determined to assume my position as a man.\nMy boyish ways were departing, and a sullen dignity and composure was\ntaking their place.\n\nThe thought of love did not hinder my ambitions. I had a vague dream of\nsome day courting a pretty maiden, after I had made my reputation, and\nwon the eagle feathers.\n\nOne day, when I was away on the daily hunt, two strangers from the\nUnited States visited our camp. They had boldly ventured across\nthe northern border. They were Indians, but clad in the white man’s\ngarments. It was as well that I was absent with my gun.\n\nMy father, accompanied by an Indian guide, after many days’ searching\nhad found us at last. He had been imprisoned at Davenport, Iowa, with\nthose who took part in the massacre or in the battles following, and\nhe was taught in prison and converted by the pioneer missionaries, Drs.\nWilliamson and Riggs. He was under sentence of death, but was among the\nnumber against whom no direct evidence was found, and who were finally\npardoned by President Lincoln.\n\nWhen he was released, and returned to the new reservation upon the\nMissouri river, he soon became convinced that life on a government\nreservation meant physical and moral degradation. Therefore he\ndetermined, with several others, to try the white man’s way of gaining a\nlivelihood. They accordingly left the agency against the persuasions of\nthe agent, renounced all government assistance, and took land under the\nUnited States Homestead law, on the Big Sioux river. After he had\nmade his home there, he desired to seek his lost child. It was then a\ndangerous undertaking to cross the line, but his Christian love prompted\nhim to do it. He secured a good guide, and found his way in time through\nthe vast wilderness.\n\nAs for me, I little dreamed of anything unusual to happen on my return.\nAs I approached our camp with my game on my shoulder, I had not the\nslightest premonition that I was suddenly to be hurled from my savage\nlife into a life unknown to me hitherto.\n\nWhen I appeared in sight my father, who had patiently listened to my\nuncle’s long account of my early life and training, became very much\nexcited. He was eager to embrace the child who, as he had just been\ninformed, made it already the object of his life to avenge his father’s\nblood. The loving father could not remain in the teepee and watch the\nboy coming, so he started to meet him. My uncle arose to go with his\nbrother to insure his safety.\n\nMy face burned with the unusual excitement caused by the sight of a man\nwearing the Big Knives’ clothing and coming toward me with my uncle.\n\n“What does this mean, uncle?”\n\n“My boy, this is your father, my brother, whom we mourned as dead. He\nhas come for you.”\n\nMy father added: “I am glad that my son is strong and brave. Your\nbrothers have adopted the white man’s way; I came for you to learn this\nnew way, too; and I want you to grow up a good man.”\n\nHe had brought me some civilized clothing, At first, I disliked very\nmuch to wear garments made by the people I had hated so bitterly. But\nthe thought that, after all, they had not killed my father and brothers,\nreconciled me, and I put on the clothes.\n\nIn a few days we started for the States. I felt as if I were dead and\ntraveling to the Spirit Land; for now all my old ideas were to give\nplace to new ones, and my life was to be entirely different from that of\nthe past.\n\nStill, I was eager to see some of the wonderful inventions of the\nwhite people. When we reached Fort Totten, I gazed about me with lively\ninterest and a quick imagination.\n\nMy father had forgotten to tell me that the fire-boat-walks-on-mountains\nhad its track at Jamestown, and might appear at any moment. As I was\nwatering the ponies, a peculiar shrilling noise pealed forth from just\nbeyond the hills. The ponies threw back their heads and listened; then\nthey ran snorting over the prairie. Meanwhile, I too had taken alarm. I\nleaped on the back of one of the ponies, and dashed off at full\nspeed. It was a clear day; I could not imagine what had caused such an\nunearthly noise. It seemed as if the world were about to burst in two!\n\nI got upon a hill as the train appeared. “O!” I said to myself, “that is\nthe fire-boat-walkson-mountains that I have heard about!” Then I drove\nback the ponies.\n\nMy father was accustomed every morning to read from his Bible, and\nsing a stanza of a hymn. I was about very early with my gun for several\nmornings; but at last he stopped me as I was preparing to go out, and\nbade me wait.\n\nI listened with much astonishment. The hymn contained the word Jesus.\nI did not comprehend what this meant; and my father then told me that\nJesus was the Son of God who came on earth to save sinners, and that it\nwas because of him that he had sought me. This conversation made a deep\nimpression upon my mind.\n\nLate in the fall we reached the citizen settlement at Flandreau, South\nDakota, where my father and some others dwelt among the whites. Here my\nwild life came to an end, and my school days began."
