 "text": "BLIX\n\nby Frank Norris\n\n1899\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\nIt had just struck nine from the cuckoo clock that hung over the\nmantelpiece in the dining-room, when Victorine brought in the halved\nwatermelon and set it in front of Mr. Bessemer's plate.  Then she went\ndown to the front door for the damp, twisted roll of the Sunday\nmorning's paper, and came back and rang the breakfast-bell for the\nsecond time.\n\nAs the family still hesitated to appear, she went to the bay window at\nthe end of the room, and stood there for a moment looking out.  The\nview was wonderful.  The Bessemers lived upon the Washington Street\nhill, almost at its very summit, in a flat in the third story of the\nbuilding.  The contractor had been clever enough to reverse the\nposition of kitchen and dining-room, so that the latter room was at the\nrear of the house.  From its window one could command a sweep of San\nFrancisco Bay and the Contra Costa shore, from Mount Diablo, along past\nOakland, Berkeley, Sausalito, and Mount Tamalpais, out to the Golden\nGate, the Presidio, the ocean, and even--on very clear days--to the\nFarrallone islands.\n\nFor some time Victorine stood looking down at the great expanse of land\nand sea, then faced about with an impatient exclamation.\n\nOn Sundays all the week-day regime of the family was deranged, and\nbreakfast was a movable feast, to be had any time after seven or before\nhalf-past nine.  As Victorine was pouring the ice-water, Mr. Bessemer\nhimself came in, and addressed himself at once to his meal, without so\nmuch as a thought of waiting for the others.\n\nHe was a little round man.  He wore a skull-cap to keep his bald spot\nwarm, and read his paper through a reading-glass.  The expression of\nhis face, wrinkled and bearded, the eyes shadowed by enormous gray\neyebrows, was that of an amiable gorilla.\n\nBessemer was one of those men who seem entirely disassociated from\ntheir families.  Only on rare and intense occasions did his paternal\nspirit or instincts assert themselves.  At table he talked but little.\nThough devotedly fond of his eldest daughter, she was a puzzle and a\nstranger to him.  His interests and hers were absolutely dissimilar.\nThe children he seldom spoke to but to reprove; while Howard, the son,\nthe ten-year-old and terrible infant of the household, he always\nreferred to as \"that boy.\"\n\nHe was an abstracted, self-centred old man, with but two\nhobbies--homoeopathy and the mechanism of clocks.  But he had a strange\nway of talking to himself in a low voice, keeping up a running,\nhalf-whispered comment upon his own doings and actions; as, for\ninstance, upon this occasion: \"Nine o'clock--the clock's a little fast.\nI think I'll wind my watch.  No, I've forgotten my watch.  Watermelon\nthis morning, eh? Where's a knife? I'll have a little salt.\nVictorine's forgot the spoons--ha, here's a spoon! No, it's a knife I\nwant.\"\n\nAfter he had finished his watermelon, and while Victorine was pouring\nhis coffee, the two children came in, scrambling to their places, and\ndrumming on the table with their knife-handles.\n\nThe son and heir, Howard, was very much a boy.  He played baseball too\nwell to be a very good boy, and for the sake of his own self-respect\nmaintained an attitude of perpetual revolt against his older sister,\nwho, as much as possible, took the place of the mother, long since\ndead.  Under her supervision, Howard blacked his own shoes every\nmorning before breakfast, changed his underclothes twice a week, and\nwas dissuaded from playing with the dentist's son who lived three doors\nbelow and who had St. Vitus' dance.\n\nHis little sister was much more tractable.  She had been christened\nAlberta, and was called Snooky.  She promised to be pretty when she\ngrew up, but was at this time in that distressing transitional stage\nbetween twelve and fifteen; was long-legged, and endowed with all the\nawkwardness of a colt.  Her shoes were still innocent of heels; but on\nthose occasions when she was allowed to wear her tiny first pair of\ncorsets she was exalted to an almost celestial pitch of silent ecstasy.\nThe clasp of the miniature stays around her small body was like the\nembrace of a little lover, and awoke in her ideas that were as vague,\nas immature and unformed as the straight little figure itself.\n\nWhen Snooky and Howard had seated themselves, but one chair--at the end\nof the breakfast-table, opposite Mr. Bessemer--remained vacant.\n\n\"Is your sister--is Miss Travis going to have her breakfast now?  Is\nshe got up yet?\" inquired Victorine of Howard and Snooky, as she pushed\nthe cream pitcher out of Howard's reach.  It was significant of Mr.\nBessemer's relations with his family that Victorine did not address her\nquestion to him.\n\n\"Yes, yes, she's coming,\" said both the children, speaking together;\nand Howard added: \"Here she comes now.\"\n\nTravis Bessemer came in.  Even in San Francisco, where all women are\nmore or less beautiful, Travis passed for a beautiful girl.  She was\nyoung, but tall as most men, and solidly, almost heavily built.  Her\nshoulders were broad, her chest was deep, her neck round and firm.  She\nradiated health; there were exuberance and vitality in the very touch\nof her foot upon the carpet, and there was that cleanliness about her,\nthat freshness, that suggested a recent plunge in the surf and a\n\"constitutional\" along the beach.  One felt that here was stamina, good\nphysical force, and fine animal vigor.  Her arms were large, her wrists\nwere large, and her fingers did not taper.  Her hair was of a brown so\nlight as to be almost yellow.  In fact, it would be safer to call it\nyellow from the start--not golden nor flaxen, but plain, honest yellow.\nThe skin of her face was clean and white, except where it flushed to a\nmost charming pink upon her smooth, cool cheeks.  Her lips were full\nand red, her chin very round and a little salient.  Curiously enough,\nher eyes were small--small, but of the deepest, deepest brown, and\nalways twinkling and alight, as though she were just ready to smile or\nhad just done smiling, one could not say which.  And nothing could have\nbeen more delightful than these sloe-brown, glinting little eyes of\nhers set off by her white skin and yellow hair.\n\nShe impressed one as being a very normal girl: nothing morbid about\nher, nothing nervous or false or overwrought.  You did not expect to\nfind her introspective.  You felt sure that her mental life was not at\nall the result of thoughts and reflections germinating from within, but\nrather of impressions and sensations that came to her from without.\nThere was nothing extraordinary about Travis.  She never had her\nvagaries, was not moody--depressed one day and exalted the next.  She\nwas just a good, sweet, natural, healthy-minded, healthy-bodied girl,\nhonest, strong, self-reliant, and good-tempered.\n\nThough she was not yet dressed for church, there was style in her to\nthe pointed tips of her patent-leather slippers.  She wore a heavy\nblack overskirt that rustled in delicious fashion over the colored silk\nskirt beneath, and a white shirt-waist, striped black, and starched to\na rattling stiffness.  Her neck was swathed tight and high with a broad\nribbon of white satin, while around her waist, in place of a belt, she\nwore the huge dog-collar of a St. Bernard--a chic little idea which was\nall her own, and of which she was very proud.\n\nShe was as trig and trim and crisp as a crack yacht: not a pin was\nloose, not a seam that did not fall in its precise right line; and with\nevery movement there emanated from her a barely perceptible delicious\nfeminine odor--an odor that was in part perfume, but mostly a subtle,\nvague smell, charming beyond words, that came from her hair, her neck,\nher arms--her whole sweet personality.  She was nineteen years old.\n\nShe sat down to breakfast and ate heartily, though with her attention\ndivided between Howard--who was atrociously bad, as usual of a Sunday\nmorning--and her father's plate.  Mr. Bessemer was as like as not to\nleave the table without any breakfast at all unless his fruit, chops,\nand coffee were actually thrust under his nose.\n\n\"Papum,\" she called, speaking clear and distinct, as though to the\ndeaf, \"there's your coffee there at your elbow; be careful, you'll tip\nit over.  Victorine, push his cup further on the table.  Is it strong\nenough for you, Papum?\"\n\n\"Eh? Ah, yes--yes--yes,\" murmured the old man, looking vaguely about\nhim; \"coffee, to be sure\"--and he emptied the cup at a single draught,\nhardly knowing whether it was coffee or tea.  \"Now I'll take a roll,\"\nhe continued, in a monotonous murmur.  \"Where are the rolls? Here they\nare.  Hot rolls are bad for my digestion--I ought to eat bread.  I\nthink I eat too much.  Where's my place in the paper?--always lose my\nplace in the paper.  Clever editorials this fellow Eastman writes,\nunbiassed by party prejudice--unbiassed--unbiassed.\" His voice died to\na whisper.\n\nThe breakfast proceeded, Travis supervising everything that went\nforward, even giving directions to Victorine as to the hour for serving\ndinner.  It was while she was talking to Victorine as to this matter\nthat Snooky began to whine.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\n\"And tell Maggie,\" pursued Travis, \"to fricassee her chicken, and not\nto have it too well done--\"\n\n\"Sto-o-op!\" whined Snooky again.\n\n\"And leave the heart out for Papum.  He likes the heart--\"\n\n\"Sto-o-op!\"\n\n\"Unbiassed by prejudice,\" murmured Mr. Bessemer, \"vigorous and to the\npoint.  I'll have another roll.\"\n\n\"Pa, make Howard stop!\"\n\n\"Howard!\" exclaimed Travis; \"what is it now?\"\n\n\"Howard's squirting watermelon-seeds at me,\" whined Snooky, \"and Pa\nwon't make him stop.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't so!\" vociferated Howard.  \"I only held one between my\nfingers, and it just kind of shot out.\"\n\n\"You'll come upstairs with me in just five minutes,\" announced Travis,\n\"and get ready for Sunday-school.\"\n\nHoward knew that his older sister's decisions were as the laws of the\nPersians, and found means to finish his breakfast within the specified\ntime, though not without protest.  Once upstairs, however, the usual\nSunday morning drama of despatching him to Sunday-school in presentable\ncondition was enacted.  At every moment his voice could be heard\nuplifted in shrill expostulation and debate.  No, his hands were clean\nenough, and he didn't see why he had to wear that little old pink tie;\nand, oh! his new shoes were too tight and hurt his sore toe; and he\nwouldn't, he wouldn't--no, not if he were killed for it, change his\nshirt.  Not for a moment did Travis lose her temper with him.  But\n\"very well,\" she declared at length, \"the next time she saw that little\nMiner girl she would tell her that he had said she was his beau-heart.\nNOW would he hold still while she brushed his hair?\"\n\nAt a few minutes before eleven Travis and her father went to church.\nThey were Episcopalians, and for time out of mind had rented a half-pew\nin the church of their denomination on California Street, not far from\nChinatown.  By noon the family reassembled at dinner-table, where Mr.\nBessemer ate his chicken-heart--after Travis had thrice reminded him of\nit--and expressed himself as to the sermon and the minister's theology:\nsometimes to his daughter and sometimes to himself.\n\nAfter dinner Howard and Snooky foregathered in the nursery with their\nbeloved lead soldiers; Travis went to her room to write letters; and\nMr. Bessemer sat in the bay window of the dining-room reading the paper\nfrom end to end.\n\nAt five Travis bestirred herself.  It was Victorine's afternoon out.\nTravis set the table, spreading a cover of blue denim edged with white\nbraid, which showed off the silver and the set of delft--her great and\nnever-ending joy--to great effect.  Then she tied her apron about her,\nand went into the kitchen to make the mayonnaise dressing for the\npotato salad, to slice the ham, and to help the cook (a most\ninefficient Irish person, taken on only for that month during the\nabsence of the family's beloved and venerated Sing Wo) in the matter of\npreparing the Sunday evening tea.\n\nTea was had at half-past five.  Never in the history of the family had\nits menu varied: cold ham, potato salad, pork and beans, canned fruit,\nchocolate, and the inevitable pitcher of ice-water.\n\nIn the absence of Victorine, Maggie waited on the table, very\nuncomfortable in her one good dress and stiff white apron.  She stood\noff from the table, making awkward dabs at it from time to time.  In\nher excess of deference she developed a clumsiness that was beyond all\nexpression.  She passed the plates upon the wrong side, and remembered\nherself with a broken apology at inopportune moments.  She dropped a\nspoon, she spilled the ice-water.  She handled the delft cups and\nplatters with an exaggerated solicitude, as though they were glass\nbombs.  She brushed the crumbs into their laps instead of into the\ncrumb-tray, and at last, when she had sat even Travis' placid nerves in\na jangle, was dismissed to the kitchen, and retired with a gasp of\nunspeakable relief.\n\nSuddenly there came a prolonged trilling of the electric bell, and\nHoward flashed a grin at Travis.  Snooky jumped up and pushed back,\ncrying out: \"I'll go! I'll go!\"\n\nMr. Bessemer glanced nervously at Travis.  \"That's Mr. Rivers, isn't\nit, daughter?\" Travis smiled.  \"Well, I think I'll--I think I'd\nbetter--\" he began.\n\n\"No,\" said Travis, \"I don't want you to, Papum; you sit right where you\nare.  How absurd!\"\n\nThe old man dropped obediently back into his seat.\n\n\"That's all right, Maggie,\" said Travis as the cook reappeared from the\npantry.  \"Snooky went.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed Howard, his grin widening.  \"Huh!\"\n\n\"And remember one thing, Howard,\" remarked Travis calmly, \"don't you\never again ask Mr. Rivers for a nickel to put in your bank.\"\n\nMr. Bessemer roused up.  \"Did that boy do that?\" he inquired sharply of\nTravis.\n\n\"Well, well, he won't do it again,\" said Travis soothingly.  The old\nman glared for an instant at Howard, who shifted uneasily in his seat.\nBut meanwhile Snooky had clambered down to the outside door, and before\nanything further could be said young Rivers came into the dining-room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nFor some reason, never made sufficiently clear, Rivers' parents had\nhandicapped him from the baptismal font with the prenomen of Conde,\nwhich, however, upon Anglo-Saxon tongues, had been promptly modified to\nCondy, or even, among his familiar and intimate friends, to Conny.\nAsked as to his birthplace--for no Californian assumes that his\nneighbor is born in the State--Condy was wont to reply that he was\n\"bawn 'n' rais'\" in Chicago; \"but,\" he always added, \"I couldn't help\nthat, you know.\" His people had come West in the early eighties, just\nin time to bury the father in alien soil.  Condy was an only child.  He\nwas educated at the State University, had a finishing year at Yale, and\na few months after his return home was taken on the staff of the San\nFrancisco \"Daily Times\" as an associate editor of its Sunday\nsupplement.  For Condy had developed a taste and talent in the matter\nof writing.  Short stories were his mania.  He had begun by an\ninoculation of the Kipling virus, had suffered an almost fatal attack\nof Harding Davis, and had even been affected by Maupassant.  He \"went\nin\" for accuracy of detail; held that if one wrote a story involving\nfiremen one should have, or seem to have, every detail of the\ndepartment at his fingers' ends, and should \"bring in\" to the tale all\nmanner of technical names and cant phrases.\n\nMuch of his work on the Sunday supplement of \"The Times\" was of the\nhack order--special articles, write-ups, and interviews.  About once a\nmonth, however, he wrote a short story, and of late, now that he was\nconvalescing from Maupassant and had begun to be somewhat himself,\nthese stories had improved in quality, and one or two had even been\ncopied in the Eastern journals.  He earned $100 a month.\n\nWhen Snooky had let him in, Rivers dashed up the stairs of the\nBessemers' flat, two at a time, tossed his stick into a porcelain\ncane-rack in the hall, wrenched off his overcoat with a single\nmovement, and precipitated himself, panting, into the dining-room,\ntugging at his gloves.\n\nHe was twenty-eight years old--nearly ten years older than Travis; tall\nand somewhat lean; his face smooth-shaven and pink all over, as if he\nhad just given it a violent rubbing with a crash towel.  Unlike most\nwriting folk, he dressed himself according to prevailing custom.  But\nCondy overdid the matter.  His scarfs and cravats were too bright, his\ncolored shirt-bosoms were too broadly barred, his waistcoats too\nextreme.  Even Travis, as she rose to his abrupt entrance? told herself\nthat of a Sunday evening a pink shirt and scarlet tie were a\ncombination hardly to be forgiven.\n\nCondy shook her hand in both of his, then rushed over to Mr. Bessemer,\nexclaiming between breaths: \"Don't get up, sir--don't THINK of it!\nHeavens! I'm disgustingly late.  You're all through.  My watch--this\nbeastly watch of mine--I can't imagine how I came to be so late.  You\ndid quite right not to wait.\"\n\nThen as his morbidly keen observation caught a certain look of\nblankness on Travis' face, and his rapid glance noted no vacant chair\nat table, he gave a quick gasp of dismay.\n\n\"Heavens and earth! didn't you EXPECT me?\" he cried.  \"I thought you\nsaid--I thought--I must have forgotten--I must have got it mixed up\nsomehow.  What a hideous mistake, what a blunder! What a fool I am!\"\n\nHe dropped into a chair against the wall and mopped his forehead with a\nblue-bordered handkerchief.\n\n\"Well, what difference does it make, Condy?\" said Travis quietly.\n\"I'll put another place for you.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" he vociferated, jumping up.  \"I won't hear of it, I won't\npermit it! You'll think I did it on purpose!\"\n\nTravis ignored his interference, and made a place for him opposite the\nchildren, and had Maggie make some more chocolate.\n\nCondy meanwhile covered himself with opprobrium.\n\n\"And all this trouble--I always make trouble everywhere I go.  Always a\nround man in a square hole, or a square man in a round hole.\"\n\nHe got up and sat down again, crossed and recrossed his legs, picked up\nlittle ornaments from the mantelpiece, and replaced them without\nconsciousness of what they were, and finally broke the crystal of his\nwatch as he was resetting it by the cuckoo clock.\n\n\"Hello!\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"where did you get that clock?  Where\ndid you get that clock? That's new to me.  Where did that come from?\"\n\n\"That cuckoo clock?\" inquired Travis, with a stare.  \"Condy Rivers,\nyou've been here and in this room at least twice a week for the last\nyear and a half, and that clock, and no other, has always hung there.\"\n\nBut already Condy had forgotten or lost interest in the clock.\n\n\"Is that so? is that so?\" he murmured absent-mindedly, seating himself\nat the table.\n\nMr. Bessemer was murmuring: \"That clock's a little fast.  I can not\nmake that clock keep time.  Victorine has lost the key.  I have to wind\nit with a monkey-wrench.  Now I'll try some more beans.  Maggie has put\nin too much pepper.  I'll have to have a new key made to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Hey? Yes--yes.  Is that so?\" answered Condy Rivers, bewildered,\nwishing to be polite, yet unable to follow the old man's mutterings.\n\n\"He's not talking to you,\" remarked Travis, without lowering her voice.\n\"You know how Papum goes on.  He won't hear a word you say.  Well, I\nread your story in this morning's 'Times.'\"\n\nA few moments later, while Travers and Condy were still discussing this\nstory, Mr. Bessemer rose.  \"Well, Mr. Rivers,\" he announced, \"I guess\nI'll say good-night.  Come, Snooky.\"\n\n\"Yes, take her with you, Papum,\" said Travis.  \"She'll go to sleep on\nthe lounge here if you don't.  Howard, have you got your lessons for\nto-morrow?\"\n\nIt appeared that he had not.  Snooky whined to stay up a little longer,\nbut at last consented to go with her father.  They all bade Condy\ngood-night and took themselves away, Howard lingering a moment in the\ndoor in the hope of the nickel he dared not ask for.  Maggie reappeared\nto clear away the table.\n\n\"Let's go in the parlor,\" suggested Travis, rising.  \"Don't you want\nto?\"\n\nThe parlor was the front room overlooking the street, and was reached\nby the long hall that ran the whole length of the flat, passing by the\ndoor of each one of its eight rooms in turn.\n\nTravis preceded Condy, and turned up one of the burners in colored\nglobe of the little brass chandelier.\n\nThe parlor was a small affair, peopled by a family of chairs and sofas\nrobed in white drugget.  A gold-and-white effect had been striven for\nthroughout the room.  The walls had been tinted instead of papered, and\nbunches of hand-painted pink flowers tied up with blue ribbons\nstraggled from one corner of the ceiling.  Across one angle of the room\nstraddled a brass easel upholding a crayon portrait of Travis at the\nage of nine, \"enlarged from a photograph.\" A yellow drape ornamented\none corner of the frame, while another drape of blue depended from one\nend of the mantelpiece.\n\nThe piano, upon which nobody ever played, balanced the easel in an\nopposite corner.  Over the mantelpiece hung in a gilded frame a steel\nengraving of Priscilla and John Alden; and on the mantel itself two\nbisque figures of an Italian fisher boy and girl kept company with the\nclock, a huge timepiece, set in a red plush palette, that never was\nknown to go.  But at the right of the fireplace, and balancing the tuft\nof pampa-grass to the left, was an inverted section of a sewer-pipe\npainted blue and decorated with daisies.  Into it was thrust a sheaf of\ncat-tails, gilded, and tied with a pink ribbon.\n\nTravis dropped upon the shrouded sofa, and Condy set himself carefully\ndown on one of the frail chairs with its spindling golden legs, and\nthey began to talk.\n\nCondy had taken her to the theatre the Monday night of that week, as\nhad been his custom ever since he had known her well, and there was\nsomething left for them to say on that subject.  But in ten minutes\nthey had exhausted it.  An engagement of a girl known to both of them\nhad just been announced.  Condy brought that up, and kept conversation\ngoing for another twenty minutes, and then filled in what threatened to\nbe a gap by telling her stories of the society reporters, and how they\ngot inside news by listening to telephone party wires for days at a\ntime.  Travis' condemnation of this occupied another five or ten\nminutes; and so what with this and with that they reached nine o'clock.\nThen decidedly the evening began to drag.  It was too early to go.\nCondy could find no good excuse for taking himself away, and, though\nTravis was good-natured enough, and met him more than half-way, their\ntalk lapsed, and lapsed, and lapsed.  The breaks became more numerous\nand lasted longer.  Condy began to wonder if he was boring her.  No\nsooner had the suspicion entered his head than it hardened into a\ncertainty, and at once what little fluency and freshness he yet\nretained forsook him on the spot.  What made matters worse was his\nrecollection of other evenings that of late he had failed in precisely\nthe same manner.  Even while he struggled to save the situation Condy\nwas wondering if they two were talked out--if they had lost charm for\neach other.  Did he not know Travis through and through by now--her\nopinions, her ideas, her convictions? Was there any more freshness in\nher for him? Was their little flirtation of the last eighteen months,\ncharming as it had been, about to end?  Had they played out the play,\nhad they come to the end of each other's resources? He had never\nconsidered the possibility of this before, but all at once as he looked\nat Travis--looked fairly into her little brown-black eyes--it was borne\nin upon him that she was thinking precisely the same thing.\n\nCondy Rivers had met Travis at a dance a year and a half before this,\nand, because she was so very pretty, so unaffected, and so\ngood-natured, had found means to see her three or four times a week\never since.  They two \"went out\" not a little in San Francisco society,\nand had been in a measure identified with what was known as the Younger\nSet; though Travis was too young to come out, and Rivers too old to\nfeel very much at home with girls of twenty and boys of eighteen.\n\nThey had known each other in the conventional way (as conventionality\ngoes in San Francisco); during the season Rivers took her to the\ntheatres Monday nights, and called regularly Wednesdays and Sundays.\nThen they met at dances, and managed to be invited to the same houses\nfor teas and dinners.  They had flirted rather desperately, and at\ntimes Condy even told himself that he loved this girl so much younger\nthan he--this girl with the smiling eyes and robust figure and yellow\nhair, who was so frank, so straightforward, and so wonderfully pretty.\n\nBut evidently they had come to the last move in the game, and as Condy\nreflected that after all he had never known the real Travis, that the\ngirl whom he told himself he knew through and through was only the\nTravis of dinner parties and afternoon functions, he was suddenly\nsurprised to experience a sudden qualm of deep and genuine regret.  He\nhad never been NEAR to her, after all.  They were as far apart as when\nthey had first met.  And yet he knew enough of her to know that she was\n\"worth while.\" He had had experience--all the experience he\nwanted--with other older women and girls of society.  They were\nsophisticated, they were all a little tired, they had run the gamut of\namusements--in a word, they were jaded.  But Travis, this girl of\nnineteen, who was not yet even a debutante, had been fresh and\nunspoiled, had been new and strong and young.\n\n\"Of course, you may call it what you like.  He was nothing more nor\nless than intoxicated--yes, drunk.\"\n\n\"Hah! who--what--wh--what are you talking about?\" gasped Condy sitting\nbolt upright.\n\n\"Jack Carter,\" answered Travis.  \"No,\" she added, shaking her head at\nhim helplessly, \"he hasn't been listening to a word.  I'm talking about\nJack Carter and the 'Saturday Evening' last night.\"\n\n\"No, no, I haven't heard.  Forgive me; I was thinking--thinking of\nsomething else.  Who was drunk?\"\n\nTravis paused a moment, settling her side-combs in her hair; then:\n\n\"If you will try to listen, I'll tell it all over again, because it's\nserious with me, and I'm going to take a very decided stand about it.\nYou know,\" she went on--\"you know what the 'Saturday Evening' is.\nPlenty of the girls who are not 'out' belong, and a good many of last\nyear's debutantes come, as well as the older girls of three or four\nseasons' standing.  You could call it representative couldn't you?\nWell, they always serve punch; and you know yourself that you have seen\nmen there who have taken more than they should.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" admitted Condy.  \"I know Carter and the two Catlin boys\nalways do.\"\n\n\"It gets pretty bad sometimes, doesn't it?\" she said.\n\n\"It does, it does--and it's shameful.  But most of the girls--MOST of\nthem don't seem to mind.\"\n\nMiss Bessemer stiffened a bit.  \"There are one or two girls that do,\"\nshe said quietly.  \"Frank Catlin had the decency to go home last\nnight,\" she continued; \"and his brother wasn't any worse than usual.\nBut Jack Carter must have been drinking before he came.  He was very\nbad indeed--as bad,\" she said between her teeth, \"as he could be and\nyet walk straight.  As you say, most of the girls don't mind.  They\nsay, 'It's only Johnnie Carter; what do you expect?' But one of the\ngirls--you know her, Laurie Flagg--cut a dance with him last night and\ntold him exactly why.  Of course, Carter was furious.  He was sober\nenough to think he had been insulted; and what do you suppose he did?\"\n\n\"What? what?\" exclaimed Condy, breathless, leaning toward her.\n\n\"Went about the halls and dressing-rooms circulating some dirty little\nlie about Laurie.  Actually trying to--to\"--Travis hesitated--\"to make\na scandal about her.\"\n\nCondy bounded in his seat.  \"Beast, cad, swine!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I didn't think,\" said Travis, \"that Carter would so much as dare to\nask me to dance with him--\"\n\n\"Did he? did--did--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she interrupted.  \"So I wasn't at all prepared for what\nhappened.  During the german, before I knew it, there he was in front\nof me.  It was a break, and he wanted it.  I hadn't time to think.  The\nonly idea I had was that if I refused him he might tell some dirty\nlittle lie about me.  I was all confused--mixed up.  I felt just as\nthough it were a snake that I had to humor to get rid of.  I gave him\nthe break.\"\n\nCondy sat speechless.  Suddenly he arose.\n\n\"Well, now, let's see,\" he began, speaking rapidly, his hands twisting\nand untwisting till the knuckles cracked.  \"Now, let's see.  You leave\nit to me.  I know Carter.  He's going to be at a stag dinner where I am\ninvited to-morrow night, and I--I--\"\n\n\"No, you won't, Condy,\" said Travis placidly.  \"You'll pay no attention\nto it, and I'll tell you why.  Suppose you should make a scene with Mr.\nCarter--I don't know how men settle these things.  Well, it would be\ntold in all the clubs and in all the newspaper offices that two men had\nquarreled over a girl; and my name is mentioned, discussed, and handed\naround from one crowd of men to another, from one club to another; and\nthen, of course, the papers take it up.  By that time Mr. Carter will\nhave told his side of the story and invented another dirty little lie,\nand I'm the one who suffers the most in the end.  And remember, Condy,\nthat I haven't any mother in such an affair, not even an older sister.\nNo, we'll just let the matter drop.  It would be more dignified,\nanyhow.  Only I have made up my mind what I am going to do.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"I'm not coming out.  If that's the sort of thing one has to put up\nwith in society\"--Travis drew a little line on the sofa at her side\nwith her finger-tip--\"I am going to--stop--right--there.  It's\nnot\"--Miss Bessemer stiffened again--\"that I'm afraid of Jack Carter\nand his dirty stories; I simply don't want to know the kind of people\nwho have made Jack Carter possible.  The other girls don't mind it, nor\nmany men besides you, Condy; and I'm not going to be associated with\npeople who take it as a joke for a man to come to a function drunk.\nAnd as for having a good time, I'll find my amusements somewhere else.\nI'll ride a wheel, take long walks, study something.  But as for\nleading the life of a society girl--no! And whether I have a good time\nor not, I'll keep my own self-respect.  At least I'll never have to\ndance with a drunken man.  I won't have to humiliate myself like that a\nsecond time.\"\n\n\"But I presume you will still continue to go out somewhere,\" protested\nCondy Rivers.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I have thought it all over, and I've talked about it with Papum.\nThere's no half way about it.  The only way to stop is to stop short.\nJust this afternoon I've regretted three functions for next week, and I\nshall resign from the 'Saturday Evening.' Oh, it's not the Jack Carter\naffair alone!\" she exclaimed; \"the whole thing tires me.  Mind, Condy,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"I'm not going to break with it because I have any\n'purpose in life,' or that sort of thing.  I want to have a good time,\nand I'm going to see if I can't have it in my own way.  If the kind of\nthing that makes Jack Carter possible is conventionality, then I'm done\nwith conventionality for good.  I am going to try, from this time on,\nto be just as true to myself as I can be.  I am going to be sincere,\nand not pretend to like people and things that I don't like; and I'm\ngoing to do the things that I like to do--just so long as they are the\nthings a good girl can do.  See, Condy?\"\n\n\"You're fine,\" murmured Condy breathless.  \"You're fine as gold,\nTravis, and I--I love you all the better for it.\"\n\n\"Ah, NOW!\" exclaimed Travis, with a brusque movement, \"there's mother\nthing we must talk about.  No more foolishness between us.  We've had a\njolly little flirtation, I know, and it's been good fun while it\nlasted.  I know you like me, and you know that I like you; but as for\nloving each other, you know we don't.  Yes, you say that you love me\nand that I'm the only girl.  That's part of the game.  I can play\nit\"--her little eyes began to dance--\"quite as well as you.  But it's\nplaying with something that's quite too serious to be played\nwith--after all, isn't it, now? It's insincere, and, as I tell you,\nfrom now on I'm going to be as true and as sincere and as honest as I\ncan.\"\n\n\"But I tell you that I DO love you,\" protested Condy, trying to make\nthe words ring true.\n\nTravis looked about the room an instant as if in deliberation; then\nabruptly: \"Ah! what am I going to DO with such a boy as you are, after\nall--a great big, overgrown boy? Condy Rivers, look at me straight in\nthe eye.  Tell me, do you honestly love me? You know what I mean when I\nsay 'love.' Do you love me?\"\n\n\"No, I don't!\" he exclaimed blankly, as though he had just discovered\nthe fact.\n\n\"There!\" declared Travis--\"and I don't love you.\" They both began to\nlaugh.\n\n\"Now,\" added Travis, \"we don't need to have the burden and trouble of\nkeeping up the pretences any more.  We understand each other, don't we?\"\n\n\"This is queer enough,\" said Condy drolly.\n\n\"But isn't it an improvement?\"\n\nCondy scoured his head.\n\n\"Tell me the truth,\" she insisted; \"YOU be sincere.\"\n\n\"I do believe it is.  Why--why--Travis by Jingo! Travis, I think I'm\ngoing to like you better than ever now.\"\n\n\"Never mind.  Is it an agreement?\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"That we don't pretend to love each other any more?\"\n\n\"All right--yes--you're right; because the moment I began to love you I\nshould like you so much less.\"\n\nShe put out her hand.  \"That's an agreement, then.\"\n\nCondy took her hand in his.  \"Yes, it's an agreement.\" But when, as had\nbeen his custom, he made as though to kiss her hand, Travis drew it\nquickly away.\n\n\"No! no!\" she said firmly, smiling for all that--\"no more foolishness.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" he protested, \"it's not so radical as that, is it?  You're\nnot going to overturn such time-worn, time-honored customs as that?\nWhy, this is a regular rebellion.\"\n\n\"No, sire,\" quoted Travis, trying not to laugh, \"it is a revolution.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nAlthough Monday was practically a holiday for the Sunday-supplement\nstaff of \"The Times,\" Condy Rivers made a point to get down to the\noffice betimes the next morning.  There were reasons why a certain\narticle descriptive of a great whaleback steamer taking on grain for\nfamine-stricken India should be written that day, and Rivers wanted his\nafternoon free in order to go to Laurie Flagg's coming-out tea.\n\nBut as he came into his room at \"The Times\" office, which he shared\nwith the exchange and sporting editors, and settled himself at his\ndesk, he suddenly remembered that, under the new order of things, he\nneed not expect to see Travis at the Flaggs'.\n\n\"Well,\" he muttered, \"maybe it doesn't make so much difference, after\nall.  She was a corking fine girl, but--might as well admit it--the\nplay is played out.  Of course, I don't love her--any more than she\nloves me.  I'll see less and less of her now.  It's inevitable, and\nafter a while we'll hardly even meet.  In a way, it's a pity; but, of\ncourse, one has to be sensible about these things. . . .  Well, this\nwhaleback now.\"\n\nHe rang up the Chamber of Commerce, and found out that the \"City of\nEverett,\" which was the whaleback's name, was at the Mission Street\nwharf.  This made it possible for him to write the article in two ways.\nHe either could fake his copy from a clipping on the subject which the\nexchange editor had laid on his desk, or he could go down in person to\nthe wharf, interview the captain, and inspect the craft for himself.\nThe former was the short and easy method.  The latter was more\ntroublesome, but would result in a far more interesting article.\n\nCondy debated the subject a few minutes, then decided to go down to the\nwharf.  San Francisco's water-front was always interesting, and he\nmight get hold of a photograph of the whaleback.  All at once the\n\"idea\" of the article struck him, the certain underlying notion that\nwould give importance and weight to the mere details and descriptions.\nCondy's enthusiasm flared up in an instant.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed; \"by Jove!\"\n\nHe clapped on his hat wrong side foremost, crammed a sheaf of\ncopy-paper into his pocket, and was on the street again in another\nmoment.  Then it occurred to him that he had forgotten to call at his\nclub that morning for his mail, as was his custom, on the way to the\noffice.  He looked at his watch.  It was early yet, and his club was\nbut two blocks' distance.  He decided that he would get his letters at\nthe club, and read them on the way down to the wharf.\n\nFor Condy had joined a certain San Francisco club of artists,\njournalists, musicians, and professional men that is one of the\ninstitutions of the city, and, in fact, famous throughout the United\nStates.  He was one of the younger members, but was popular and well\nliked, and on more than one occasion had materially contributed to the\nfun of the club's \"low jinks.\"\n\nIn his box this morning he found one letter that he told himself he\nmust read upon the instant.  It bore upon the envelope the name of a\nNew York publishing house to whom Condy had sent a collection of his\nshort stories about a month before.  He took the letter into the \"round\nwindow\" of the club, overlooking the street, and tore it open\nexcitedly.  The fact that he had received a letter from the firm\nwithout the return of his manuscript seemed a good omen.  This was what\nhe read:\n\nConde Rivers, Esq., Bohemian Club, San Francisco, Cal.\n\nDEAR SIR: We return to you by this mail the manuscript of your stories,\nwhich we do not consider as available for publication at the present\nmoment.  We would say, however, that we find in several of them\nindications of a quite unusual order of merit.  The best-selling book\njust now is the short novel--say thirty thousand words--of action and\nadventure.  Judging from the stories of your collection, we suspect\nthat your talent lies in this direction, and we would suggest that you\nwrite such a novel and submit the same to us.\n             Very respectfully,\n                    THE CENTENNIAL CO.,\n                                  New York.\n\nCondy shoved the letter into his pocket and collapsed limply into his\nchair.\n\n\"What's the good of trying to do anything anyhow!\" he muttered, looking\ngloomily down into the street.  \"My level is just the hack-work of a\nlocal Sunday supplement, and I am a fool to think of anything else.\"\n\nHis enthusiasm in the matter of the \"City of Everett\" was cold and dead\nin a moment.  He could see no possibilities in the subject whatever.\nHis \"idea\" of a few minutes previous seemed ridiculous and overwrought.\nHe would go back to the office and grind out his copy from the exchange\neditor's clipping.\n\nJust then his eye was caught by a familiar figure in trim, well-fitting\nblack halted on the opposite corner waiting for the passage of a cable\ncar.  It was Travis Bessemer.  No one but she could carry off such\nrigorous simplicity in the matter of dress so well: black skirt, black\nRussian blouse, tiny black bonnet and black veil, white kids with black\nstitching.  Simplicity itself.  Yet the style of her, as Condy Rivers\ntold himself, flew up and hit you in the face; and her figure--was\nthere anything more perfect? and the soft pretty effect of her yellow\nhair seen through the veil--could anything be more fetching? and her\nsmart carriage and the fling of her fine broad shoulders, and--no, it\nwas no use; Condy had to run down to speak to her.\n\n\"Come, come!\" she said as he pretended to jostle against her on the\ncurbstone without noticing her; \"you had best go to work.  Loafing at\nten o'clock on the street corners--the idea!\"\n\n\"It IS not--it can not be--and yet it is--it is SHE,\" he burlesqued;\n\"and after all these years!\" Then in his natural voice: \"Hello T.B.\"\n\n\"Hello, C.R.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?'\n\n\"Home.  I've just run down for half an hour to have the head of my\nbanjo tightened.\"\n\n\"If I put you on the car, will you expect me to pay your car-fare?\"\n\n\"Condy Rivers, I've long since got over the idea of ever expecting you\nto have any change concealed about your person.\"\n\n\"Huh! no, it all goes for theatre tickets, and flowers, and boxes of\ncandy for a certain girl I know.  But\"--and he glared at her\nsignificantly--\"no more foolishness.\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"What are you 'on' this morning, Condy?\"\n\nCondy told her as they started to walk toward Kearney Street.\n\n\"But why DON'T you go to the dock and see the vessel, if you can make a\nbetter article that way?\"\n\n\"Oh, what's the good! The Centennial people have turned down my\nstories.\"\n\nShe commiserated him for this; then suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\"No, you must go down to the dock! You ought to, Condy. Oh, I tell you,\nlet me go down with you!\"\n\nIn an instant Condy leaped to the notion.  \"Splendid! splendid! no\nreason why you shouldn't!\" he exclaimed.  And within fifteen minutes\nthe two were treading the wharves and quays of the city's water-front.\n\nShips innumerable nuzzled at the endless line of docks, mast\noverspiring mast, and bowsprit overlapping bowsprit, till the eye was\nbewildered, as if by the confusion of branches in a leafless forest.\nIn the distance the mass of rigging resolved itself into a solid gray\nblur against the sky.  The great hulks, green and black and slate gray,\nlaid themselves along the docks, straining leisurely at their mammoth\nchains, their flanks opened, their cargoes, as it were their entrails,\nspewed out in a wild disarray of crate and bale and box.  Sailors and\nstevedores swarmed them like vermin.  Trucks rolled along the wharves\nlike peals of ordnance, the horse-hoofs beating the boards like heavy\ndrum-taps.  Chains clanked, a ship's dog barked incessantly from a\ncompanionway, ropes creaked in complaining pulleys, blocks rattled,\nhoisting-engines coughed and strangled, while all the air was redolent\nof oakum, of pitch, of paint, of spices, of ripe fruit, of clean cool\nlumber, of coffee, of tar, of bilge, and the brisk, nimble odor of the\nsea.\n\nTravis was delighted, her little brown eyes snapping, her cheeks\nflushing, as she drank in the scene.\n\n\"To think,\" she cried, \"where all these ships have come from! Look at\ntheir names; aren't they perfect? Just the names, see: the 'Mary\nBaker,' Hull; and the 'Anandale,' Liverpool; and the 'Two Sisters,'\nCalcutta, and see that one they're calking, the 'Montevideo,' Callao;\nand there, look! look! the very one you're looking for, the 'City of\nEverett,' San Francisco.\"\n\nThe whaleback, an immense tube of steel plates, lay at her wharf,\nsucking in entire harvests of wheat from the San Joaquin\nvalley--harvests that were to feed strangely clad skeletons on the\nsouthern slopes of the Himalaya foot-hills.  Travis and Condy edged\ntheir way among piles of wheat-bags, dodging drays and rumbling trucks,\nand finally brought up at the after gangplank, where a sailor halted\nthem.  Condy exhibited his reporter's badge.\n\n\"I represent 'The Times,'\" he said, with profound solemnity, \"and I\nwant to see the officer in charge.\"\n\nThe sailor fell back upon the instant.\n\n\"Power of the press,\" whispered Condy to Travis as the two gained the\ndeck.\n\nA second sailor directed them to the mate, whom they found in the\nchart-room, engaged, singularly enough, in trimming the leaves of a\nscraggly geranium.\n\nCondy explained his mission with flattering allusions to the whaleback\nand the novelty of the construction.  The mate--an old man with a\npatriarchal beard--softened at once, asked them into his own cabin aft,\nand even brought out a camp-stool for Travis, brushing it with his\nsleeve before setting it down.\n\nWhile Condy was interviewing the old fellow, Travis was examining, with\nthe interest of a child, the details of the cabin: the rack-like bunk,\nthe washstand, ingeniously constructed so as to shut into the bulkhead\nwhen not in use, the alarm-clock screwed to the wall, and the array of\nphotographs thrust into the mirror between frame and glass.  One, an\nold daguerreotype, particularly caught her fancy.  It was the portrait\nof a very beautiful girl, wearing the old-fashioned side curls and high\ncomb of a half-century previous.  The old mate noticed the attention\nshe paid to it, and, as soon as he had done giving information to\nCondy, turned and nodded to Travis, and said quietly: \"She was pretty,\nwasn't she?\"\n\n\"Oh, very!\" answered Travis, without looking away.\n\nThere was a silence.  Then the mate, his eyes wide and thoughtful, said\nwith a long breath:\n\n\"And she was just about your age, miss, when I saw her; and you favor\nher, too.\"\n\nCondy and Travis held their breaths in attention.  There in the cabin\nof that curious nondescript whaleback they had come suddenly to the\nedge of a romance--a romance that had been lived through before they\nwere born.  Then Travis said in a low voice, and sweetly:\n\n\"She died?\"\n\n\"Before I ever set eyes on her, miss.  That is, MAYBE she died.  I\nsometimes think--fact is, I really believe she's alive yet, and waiting\nfor me.\" He hesitated awkwardly.  \"I dunno,\" he said pulling his beard.\n\"I don't usually tell that story to strange folk, but you remind me so\nof her that I guess I will.\"\n\nCondy sat down on the edge of the bunk, and the mate seated himself on\nthe plush settle opposite the door, his elbows on his knees, his eyes\nfixed on a patch of bright sunlight upon the deck outside.\n\n\"I began life,\" he said, \"as a deep-sea diver--began pretty young, too.\nI first put on the armor when I was twenty, nothing but a lad; but I\ncould take the pressure up to seventy pounds even then.  One of my very\nfirst dives was off Trincomalee, on the coast of Ceylon.  A mail packet\nhad gone down in a squall with all on board.  Six of the bodies had\ncome up and had been recovered, but the seventh hadn't.  It was the\nbody of the daughter of the governor of the island, a beautiful young\ngirl of nineteen, whom everybody loved.  I was sent for to go down and\nbring the body up.  Well, I went down.  The packet lay in a hundred\nfeet of water, and that's a wonder deep dive.  I had to go down twice.\nThe first time I couldn't find anything, though I went all through the\nberth-deck.  I came up to the wrecking-float and reported that I had\nseen nothing.  There were a lot of men there belonging to the wrecking\ngang, and some correspondents of London papers.  But they would have it\nthat she was below, and had me go down again.  I did, and this time I\nfound her.\"\n\nThe mate paused a moment\n\n\"I'll have to tell you,\" he went on, \"that when a body don't come to\nthe surface it will stand or sit in a perfectly natural position until\na current or movement of the water around touches it.  When that\nhappens--well, you'd say the body was alive; and old divers have a\nsuperstition--no, it AIN'T just a superstition, I believe it's so--that\ndrowned people really don't die till they come to the surface, and the\nair touches them.  We say that the drowned who don't come up still have\nsome sort of life of their own way down there in all that green\nwater . . . some kind of life . . . surely . . . surely.  When I went\ndown the second time, I came across the door of what I thought at first\nwas the linen-closet.  But it turned out to be a little stateroom.  I\nopened it.  There was the girl.  She was sitting on the sofa opposite\nthe door, with a little hat on her head, and holding a satchel in her\nlap, just as if she was ready to go ashore.  Her eyes were wide open,\nand she was looking right at me and smiling.  It didn't seem terrible\nor ghastly in the least.  She seemed very sweet.  When I opened the\ndoor it set the water in motion, and she got up and dropped the\nsatchel, and came toward me smiling and holding out her arms.\n\n\"I stepped back quick and shut the door, and sat down in one of the\nsaloon chairs to fetch my breath, for it had given me a start.  The\nnext thing to do was to send her up.  But I began to think.  She seemed\nso pretty as she was.  What was the use of bringing her up--up there on\nthe wrecking float with that crowd of men--up where the air would get\nat her, and where they would put her in the ground along o' the worms?\nIf I left her there she'd always be sweet and pretty--always be\nnineteen; and I remembered what old divers said about drowned people\nliving just so long as they stayed below.  You see, I was only a lad\nthen, and things like that impress you when you're young.  Well, I\nsignaled to be hauled up.  They asked me on the float if I'd seen\nanything, and I said no.  That was all there was to the affair.  They\nnever raised the ship, and in a little while it was all forgotten.\n\n\"But I never forgot it, and I always remembered her, way down there in\nall that still green water, waiting there in that little state-room for\nme to come back and open the door.  And I've growed to be an old man\nremembering her; but she's always stayed just as she was the first day\nI saw her, when she came toward me smiling and holding out her arms.\nShe's always stayed young and fresh and pretty.  I never saw her but\nthat once.  Only afterward I got her picture from a native woman of\nTrincomalee who was house-keeper at the Residency where the governor of\nthe island lived.  Somehow I never could care for other women after\nthat, and I ain't never married for that reason.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not! exclaimed Travis, in a low voice as the old\nfellow paused.\n\n\"Fine, fine; oh, fine as gold!\" murmured Condy, under his breath.\n\n\"Well,\" said the mate, getting up and rubbing his knee, \"that's the\nstory.  Now you know all about that picture.  Will you have a glass of\nMadeira, miss?\"\n\nHe got out a bottle of wine bearing the genuine Funchal label and\nfilled three tiny glasses.  Travis pushed up her veil, and she and\nCondy rose.\n\n\"This is to HER,\" said Travis gravely.\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" answered the mate, and the three drank in silence.\n\nAs Travis and Condy were going down the gangplank they met the captain\nof the whaleback coming up.\n\n\"I saw you in there talking to old McPherson,\" he explained.  \"Did you\nget what you wanted from him?\"\n\n\"More, more!\" exclaimed Condy.\n\n\"My hand in the fire, he told you that yarn about the girl who was\ndrowned off Trincomalee.  Of course, I knew it.  The old boy's wits are\nturned on that subject.  He WILL have it that the body hasn't\ndecomposed in all this time.  Good seaman enough, and a first-class\nnavigator, but he's soft in that one spot.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\"Oh, but the STORY of it!\" exclaimed Condy as he and Travis regained\nthe wharf--\"the story of it! Isn't it a ripper.  Isn't it a corker! His\nleaving her that way, and never caring for any other girl afterward.\"\n\n\"And so original,\" she commented, quite as enthusiastic as he.\n\n\"Original?--why, it's new as paint! It's--it's--Travis, I'll make a\nstory out of this that will be copied in every paper between the two\noceans.\"\n\nThey were so interested in the mate's story that they forgot to take a\ncar, and walked up Clay Street talking it over, suggesting,\nrearranging, and embellishing; and Condy was astonished and delighted\nto note that she \"caught on\" to the idea as quickly as he, and knew the\ntelling points and what details to leave out.\n\n\"And I'll make a bang-up article out of the whaleback herself,\"\ndeclared Condy.  The \"idea\" of the article had returned to him, and all\nhis enthusiasm with it.\n\n\"And look here,\" he said, showing her the letter from the Centennial\nCompany.  \"They turned down my book, but see what they say.\n\n\"Quite an unusual order of merit!\" cried Travis.  \"Why, that's fine!\nWhy didn't you show this to me before?--and asking you like this to\nwrite them a novel of adventure! What MORE can you want?  Oh!\" she\nexclaimed impatiently, \"that's so like you; you would tell everybody\nabout your reverses, and carry on about them yourself, but never say a\nword when you get a little boom.  Have you an idea for a\nthirty-thousand-word novel? Wouldn't that diver's story do?\"\n\n\"No, there's not enough in that for thirty thousand words.  I haven't\nany idea at all--never wrote a story of adventure--never wrote anything\nlonger than six thousand words.  But I'll keep my eye open for\nsomething that will do.  By the way--by Jove! Travis, where are we?\"\n\nThey looked briskly around them, and the bustling, breezy waterfront\nfaded from their recollections.  They were in a world of narrow\nstreets, of galleries and overhanging balconies.  Craziest structures,\nriddled and honeycombed with stairways and passages, shut out the sky,\nthough here and there rose a building of extraordinary richness and\nmost elaborate ornamentation.  Color was everywhere.  A thousand little\nnotes of green and yellow, of vermilion and sky blue, assaulted the\neye.  Here it was a doorway, here a vivid glint of cloth or hanging,\nhere a huge scarlet sign lettered with gold, and here a kaleidoscopic\neffect in the garments of a passer-by.  Directly opposite, and two\nstories above their heads, a sort of huge \"loggia,\" one blaze of\ngilding and crude vermilions, opened in the gray cement of a crumbling\nfacade, like a sudden burst of flame.  Gigantic pot-bellied lanterns of\nred and gold swung from its ceiling, while along its railing stood a\nrow of pots--brass, ruddy bronze, and blue porcelain--from which were\ngrowing red saffron, purple, pink, and golden tulips without number.\nThe air was vibrant with unfamiliar noises.  From one of the balconies\nnear at hand, though unseen, a gong, a pipe, and some kind of stringed\ninstrument wailed and thundered in unison.  There was a vast shuffling\nof padded soles and a continuous interchange of singsong monosyllables,\nhigh-pitched and staccato, while from every hand rose the strange\naromas of the East--sandalwood, punk, incense, oil, and the smell of\nmysterious cookery.\n\n\"Chinatown!\" exclaimed Travis.  \"I hadn't the faintest idea we had come\nup so far.  Condy Rivers, do you know what time it is?\" She pointed a\nwhite kid finger through the doorway of a drug-store, where, amid\nlacquer boxes and bronze urns of herbs and dried seeds, a round Seth\nThomas marked half-past two.\n\n\"And your lunch?\" cried Condy.  \"Great heavens! I never thought.\"\n\n\"It's too late to get any at home.  Never mind; I'll go somewhere and\nhave a cup of tea.\"\n\n\"Why not get a package of Chinese tea, now that you're down here, and\ntake it home with you?\"\n\n\"Or drink it here.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In one of the restaurants.  There wouldn't be a soul there at this\nhour.  I know they serve tea any time.  Condy, let's try it.  Wouldn't\nit be fun?\"\n\nCondy smote his thigh.  \"Fun!\" he vociferated; \"fun! It is--by Jove--it\nwould be HEAVENLY! Wait a moment.  I'll tell you what we will do.  Tea\nwon't be enough.  We'll go down to Kearney Street, or to the market,\nand get some crackers to go with it.\"\n\nThey hurried back to the California market, a few blocks distant, and\nbought some crackers and a wedge of new cheese.  On the way back to\nChinatown Travis stopped at a music store on Kearney Street to get her\nbanjo, which she had left to have its head tightened; and thus burdened\nthey regained the \"town,\" Condy grieving audibly at having to carry\n\"brown-paper bundles through the street.\"\n\n\"First catch your restaurant,\" said Travis as they turned into Dupont\nStreet with its thronging coolies and swarming, gayly clad children.\nBut they had not far to seek.\n\n\"Here you are!\" suddenly exclaimed Condy, halting in front of a\nwholesale tea-house bearing a sign in Chinese and English.  \"Come on,\nTravis!\"\n\nThey ascended two flights of a broad, brass-bound staircase leading up\nfrom the ground floor, and gained the restaurant on the top story of\nthe building.  As Travis had foretold, it was deserted.  She clasped\nher gloved hands gayly, crying: \"Isn't it delightful! We've the whole\nplace to ourselves.\"\n\nThe restaurant ran the whole depth of the building, and was finished\noff at either extremity with a gilded balcony, one overlooking Dupont\nStreet and the other the old Plaza.  Enormous screens of gilded ebony,\nintricately carved and set with colored glass panes, divided the room\ninto three, and one of these divisions, in the rear part, from which\nthey could step out upon the balcony that commanded the view of the\nPlaza, they elected as their own.\n\nIt was charming.  At their backs they had the huge, fantastic screen,\nbrave and fine with its coat of gold.  In front, through the\nglass-paned valves of a pair of folding doors, they could see the roofs\nof the houses beyond the Plaza, and beyond these the blue of the bay\nwith its anchored ships, and even beyond this the faint purple of the\nOakland shore.  On either side of these doors, in deep alcoves, were\ndivans with mattings and head-rests for opium smokers.  The walls were\npainted blue and hung with vertical Cantonese legends in red and\nsilver, while all around the sides of the room small ebony tables\nalternated with ebony stools, each inlaid with a slab of mottled\nmarble.  A chandelier, all a-glitter with tinsel, swung from the centre\nof the ceiling over a huge round table of mahogany.\n\nAnd not a soul was there to disturb them.  Below them, out there around\nthe old Plaza, the city drummed through its work with a lazy, soothing\nrumble.  Nearer at hand, Chinatown sent up the vague murmur of the life\nof the Orient.  In the direction of the Mexican quarter, the bell of\nthe cathedral knolled at intervals.  The sky was without a cloud and\nthe afternoon was warm.\n\nCondy was inarticulate with the joy of what he called their\n\"discovery.\" He got up and sat down.  He went out into the other room\nand came back again.  He dragged up a couple of the marble-seated\nstools to the table.  He took off his hat, lighted a cigarette, let it\ngo out, lighted it again, and burned his fingers.  He opened and closed\nthe folding-doors, pushed the table into a better light, and finally\nbrought Travis out upon the balcony to show her the \"points of\nhistorical interest\" in and around the Plaza.\n\n\"There's the Stevenson memorial ship in the centre, see; and right\nthere, where the flagstaff is, General Baker made the funeral oration\nover the body of Terry.  Broderick killed him in a duel--or was it\nTerry killed Broderick? I forget which.  Anyhow, right opposite, where\nthat pawnshop is, is where the Overland stages used to start in '49.\nAnd every other building that fronts on the Plaza, even this one we're\nin now, used to be a gambling-house in bonanza times; and, see, over\nyonder is the Morgue and the City Prison.\"\n\nThey turned back into the room, and a great, fat Chinaman brought them\ntea on Condy's order.  But besides tea, he brought dried almonds,\npickled watermelon rinds, candied quince, and \"China nuts.\"\n\nTravis cut the cheese into cubes with Condy's penknife, and arranged\nthe cubes in geometric figures upon the crackers.\n\n\"But, Condy,\" she complained, \"why in the world did you get so many\ncrackers? There's hundreds of them here--enough to feed a regiment.\nWhy didn't you ask me?\"\n\n\"Huh! what? what? I don't know.  What's the matter with the crackers?\nYou were dickering with the cheese, and the man said, 'How many\ncrackers?' I didn't know.  I said, 'Oh, give me a quarter's worth!'\"\n\n\"And we couldn't possibly have eaten ten cents' worth! Oh, Condy, you\nare--you are--But never mind, here's your tea.  I wonder if this green,\npasty stuff is good.\"\n\nThey found that it was, but so sweet that it made their tea taste\nbitter.  The watermelon rinds were flat to their Western palates, but\nthe dried almonds were a great success.  Then Condy promptly got the\nhiccoughs from drinking his tea too fast, and fretted up and down the\nroom like a chicken with the pip till Travis grew faint and weak with\nlaughter.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he exclaimed aggrievedly--\"laugh, that's right! I don't\nlaugh.  It isn't such fun when you've got 'em yoursel'--HULP.\"\n\n\"But sit down, for goodness' sake! You make me so nervous.  You can't\nwalk them off.  Sit down and hold your breath while you count nine.\nCondy, I'm going to take off my gloves and veil.  What do you think?\"\n\n\"Sure, of course; and I'll have a cigarette.  Do you mind if I smoke?\"\n\n\"Well, what's that in your hand now?\"\n\n\"By Jove, I have been smoking! I--I beg your pardon.  I'm a regular\nstable boy.  I'll throw it away.\"\n\nTravis caught his wrist.  \"What nonsense! I would have told you before\nif I'd minded.\"\n\n\"But it's gone out!\" he exclaimed.  \"I'll have another.\"\n\nAs he reached into his pocket for his case, his hand encountered a\npaper-covered volume, and he drew it out in some perplexity.\n\n\"Now, how in the wide world did that book come in my pocket?\" he\nmuttered, frowning.  \"What have I been carrying it around for?  I've\nforgotten.  I declare I have.\"\n\n\"What book is it?\"\n\n\"Hey? book? . . . h'm,\" he murmured, staring.\n\nTravis pounded on the table.  \"Wake up, Condy, I'm talking to you,\" she\ncalled.\n\n\"It's 'Life's Handicap,'\" he answered, with a start; \"but why and but\nwhy have I--\"\n\n\"What's it about? I never heard of it,\" she declared.\n\n\"You never heard of 'Life's Handicap'?\" he shouted; \"you never\nheard--you never--you mean to say you never heard--but here, this won't\ndo.  Sit right still, and I'll read you one of these yarns before\nyou're another minute older.  Any one of them--open the book at random.\nHere we are--'The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes'; and it's a\nstem-winder, too.\"\n\nAnd then for the first time in her life, there in that airy, golden\nChinese restaurant, in the city from which he hasted to flee, Travis\nBessemer fell under the charm of the little spectacled colonial, to\nwhose song we all must listen and to whose pipe we all must dance.\n\nThere was one \"point\" in the story of Jukes' strange ride that Condy\nprided himself upon having discovered.  So far as he knew, all critics\nhad overlooked it.  It is where Jukes is describing the man-trap of the\nCity of the Dead who are alive, and mentions that the slope of the\ninclosing sandhills was \"about forty-five degrees.\" Jukes was a civil\nengineer, and Condy held that it was a capital bit of realism on the\npart of the author to have him speak of the pitch of the hills in just\nsuch technical terms.  At first he thought he would call Travis'\nattention to this bit of cleverness; but as he read he abruptly changed\nhis mind.  He would see if she would find it out for herself.  It would\nbe a test of her quickness, he told himself; almost an unfair test,\nbecause the point was extremely subtle and could easily be ignored by\nthe most experienced of fiction readers.  He read steadily on, working\nhimself into a positive excitement as he approached the passage.  He\ncame to it and read it through without any emphasis, almost slurring\nover it in his eagerness to be perfectly fair.  But as he began to read\nthe next paragraph, Travis, her little eyes sparkling with interest and\nattention, exclaimed:\n\n\"Just as an engineer would describe it.  Isn't that good!\"\n\n\"Glory hallelujah!\" cried Condy, slamming down the book joyfully.\n\"Travis, you are one in a thousand!\"\n\n\"What--what is it?' she inquired blankly.\n\n\"Never mind, never mind; you're a wonder, that's all\"--and he finished\nthe tale without further explanation.  Then, while he smoked another\ncigarette and she drank another cup of tea, he read to her \"The Return\nof Imri\" and the \"Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney.\" He found her an\neasy and enrapt convert to the little Englishman's creed, and for\nhimself tasted the intense delight of revealing to another an\nappreciation of a literature hitherto ignored.\n\n\"Isn't he strong!\" cried Travis.  \"Just a LITTLE better than Marie\nCorelli and the Duchess!\"\n\n\"And to think of having all those stories to read! You haven't read any\nof them yet?\"\n\n\"Not a one.  I've been reading only the novels we take up in the\nWednesday class.\"\n\n\"Lord!\" muttered Condy.\n\nCondy's spirits had been steadily rising since the incident aboard the\nwhaleback.  The exhilaration of the water-front, his delight over the\nstory he was to make out of the old mate's yarn, Chinatown, the\ncharming unconventionality of their lunch in the Chinese restaurant,\nthe sparkling serenity of the afternoon, and the joy of discovering\nTravis' appreciation of his adored and venerated author, had put him\ninto a mood bordering close upon hilarity.\n\n\"The next event upon our interesting programme,\" he announced, \"will be\na banjosephine obligato in A-sia minor, by that justly renowned\nimpresario, Signor Conde Tin-pani Rivers, specially engaged for this\nperformance; with a pleasing and pan-hellenic song-and-dance turn by\nMiss Travis Bessemer, the infant phenomenon, otherwise known as 'Babby\nBessie.'\"\n\n\"You're not going to play that banjo here?\" said Travis, as he stripped\naway the canvas covering.\n\n\"Order in the gallery!\" cried Condy, beginning to tune up.  Then in a\nrapid, professional monotone: \"Ladies-and-gentlemen - with - your -\nkind - permission - I - will - endeavor - to - give - you - an -\nimitation - of - a - Carolina - coon - song\"--and without more ado,\nsinging the words to a rattling, catchy accompaniment, swung off into--\n\n\n    \"F--or MY gal's a high-born leddy,\n    SHE'S brack, but not too shady.\"\n\n\nHe did not sing loud, and the clack and snarl of the banjo carried\nhardly further than the adjoining room; but there was no one to hear,\nand, as he went along, even Travis began to hum the words, but at that,\nCondy stopped abruptly, laid the instrument across his knees with\nexaggerated solicitude, and said deliberately:\n\n\"Travis, you are a good, sweet girl, and what you lack in beauty you\nmake up in amiability, and I've no doubt you are kind to your aged\nfather; but you--can--not--sing.\"\n\nTravis was cross in a moment, all the more so because Condy had spoken\nthe exact truth.  It was quite impossible for her to carry a tune half\na dozen bars without entangling herself in as many different keys.\nWhat voice she had was not absolutely bad; but as she persisted in\nsinging in spite of Condy's guying, he put back his head and began a\nmournful and lugubrious howling.\n\n\"Ho!\" she exclaimed, grabbing the banjo from his knees, \"if I can't\nsing, I can play better than some smart people.\"\n\n\"Yes, by note,\" rallied Condy, as Travis executed a banjo \"piece\" of no\nlittle intricacy.  \"That's just like a machine--like a hand-piano.\n\n\"Order in the gallery!\" she retorted, without pausing in her playing.\nShe finished with a great flourish and gazed at him in triumph, only to\nfind him pretending a profound slumber.  \"O--o--o!\" she remarked\nbetween her teeth, \"I just hate you, Condy Rivers.\"\n\n\"There are others,\" he returned airily.\n\n\"Talk about slang.\"\n\n\"NOW what will we do?\" he cried.  \"Let's DO something.  Suppose we\nbreak something--just for fun.\"\n\nThen suddenly the gayety went out of his face, and he started up and\nclapped his hand to his head with a gasp of dismay.  \"Great Heavens!\"\nhe exclaimed.\n\n\"Condy,\" cried Travis in alarm, \"what is it\"'\n\n\"The Tea!\" he vociferated.  \"Laurie Flagg's Tea.  I ought to be\nthere--right this minute.\"\n\nTravis fetched a sigh of relief.  \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"All!\" he retorted.  \"All! Why, it's past four now--and I'd forgotten\nevery last thing.\" Then suddenly falling calm again, and quietly\nresuming his seat: \"I don't see as it makes any difference.  I won't\ngo, that's all.  Push those almonds here, will you, Miss Lady?--But we\naren't DOING anything,\" he exclaimed, with a brusque return of\nexuberance.  \"Let's do things.  What'll we do? Think of something.  Is\nthere anything we can break?\" Then, without any transition, he vaulted\nupon the table and began to declaim, with tremendous gestures:\n\n\n  \"There once was a beast called an Ounce,\n   Who went with a spring and a bounce.\n     His head was as flat\n     As the head of a cat,\n   This quadrupetantical Ounce,\n          ---tical Ounce,\n   This quadrupetantical Ounce.\n\n  \"You'd think from his name he was small,\n   But that was not like him at all.\n     He weighed, I'll be bound,\n     Three or four hundred pound,\n   And he looked most uncommonly tall,\n          --monly tall,\n   And he looked most uncommonly tall.\"\n\n\n\"Bravo! bravo!\" cried Travis, pounding on the table.  \"Hear,\nhear--none, Brutus, none.\"\n\nCondy sat down on the table and swung his legs But during the next few\nmoments, while they were eating the last of their cheese, his good\nspirits fell rapidly away from him.  He heaved a sigh, and thrust both\nhands gloomily into his pockets.\n\n\"Cheese, Condy?\" asked Travis.\n\nHe shook his head with a dark frown, muttering: \"No cheese, no cheese.\"\n\n\"What's wrong, Condy--what's the matter?\" asked Travis, with concern.\n\nFor some time he would not tell her, answering all her inquiries by\nclosing his eyes and putting his chin in the air, nodding his head in\nknowing fashion.\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"You don't respect me,\" he muttered; and for a long time this was all\nthat could be got from him.  No, no, she did not respect him; no, she\ndid not take him seriously.\n\n\"But of course I do.  Why don't I? Condy Rivers, what's got into you\nNOW?\"\n\n\"No, no; I know it.  I can tell.  You don't take me seriously.  You\ndon't respect me.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Make a blooming buffoon of myself,\" he mumbled tragically.\n\nIn great distress Travis labored to contradict him.  Why, they had just\nbeen having a good time, that was all.  Why, she had been just as silly\nas he.  Condy caught at the word.\n\n\"Silly! There.  I knew it.  I told you.  I'm silly.  I'm a\nbuffoon.--But haven't we had a great afternoon?\" he added, with a\nsudden grin.\n\n\"I never remember,\" announced Travis emphatically, \"when I've had a\nbetter time than I've had to-day; and I know just why it's been such a\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Why, then?\"\n\n\"Because we've had no foolishness.  We've just been ourselves, and\nhaven't pretended we were in love with each other when we are not.\nCondy, let's do this lots.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Go round to queer little, interesting little places.  We've had a\nglorious time to-day, haven't we?--and we haven't been talked out once.\n\n\"As we were last night, for instance,\" he hazarded.\n\n\"I THOUGHT you felt it, the same as I did.  It WAS a bit awful wasn't\nit?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"From now on, let's make a resolution.  I know you've had a good time\nto-day.  Haven't you had a better time than if you had gone to the\nTea?'\"\n\n\"Well, RATHER.  I don't know when I've had a better, jollier afternoon.\"\n\n\"Well, now, we're going to try to have lots more good times, but just\nas chums.  We've tried the other, and it failed.  Now be sincere;\ndidn't it fail?\"\n\n\"It worked out.  It DID work out.\"\n\n\"Now from this time on, no more foolishness.  We'll just be chums.\"\n\n\"Chums it is.  No more foolishness.\"\n\n\"The moment you begin to pretend you're in love with me, it will spoil\neverything.  It's funny,\" said Travis, drawing on her gloves.  \"We're\ndoing a funny thing, Condy.  With ninety-nine people out of one\nhundred, this little affair would have been all ended after our\n'explanation' of last night--confessing, as we did, that we didn't love\neach other.  Most couples would have 'drifted apart'; but here we are,\nplanning to be chums, and have good times in our own original,\nunconventional way--and we can do it, too.  There, there, he's a\nthousand miles away.  He's not heard a single word I've said.  Condy,\nare you listening to me?\"\n\n\"Blix,\" he murmured, staring at her vaguely.  \"Blix--you look that way;\nI don't know, look kind of blix.  Don't you feel sort of blix?\" he\ninquired anxiously.\n\n\"Blix?\"\n\nHe smote the table with his palm.  \"Capital!\" he cried; \"sounds bully,\nand snappy, and crisp, and bright, and sort of sudden.  Sounds--don't\nyou know, THIS way?\"--and he snapped his fingers.  \"Don't you see what\nI mean? Blix, that's who you are.  You've always been Blix, and I've\njust found it out.  Blix,\" he added, listening to the sound of the\nname.  \"Blix, Blix.  Yes, yes; that's your name.\"\n\n\"Blix?\" she repeated; \"but why Blix?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't know why not.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" he declared, as though that settled the question.  They\nmade ready to go, as it was growing late.\n\n\"Will you tie that for me, Condy,\" she asked, rising and turning the\nback of her head toward him, the ends of the veil held under her\nfingers.  \"Not too tight.  Condy, don't pull it so tight.  There,\nthere, that will do.  Have you everything that belongs to you? I know\nyou'll go away and leave something here.  There's your cigarette case,\nand your book, and of course the banjo.\"\n\nAs if warned by a mysterious instinct, the fat Chinaman made his\nappearance in the outer room.  Condy put his fingers into his vest\npocket, then dropped back upon his stool with a suppressed exclamation\nof horror.\n\n\"Condy!\" exclaimed Blix in alarm, \"are you sick?\"--for he had turned a\npositive white.\n\n\"I haven't a cent of money,\" he murmured faintly.  \"I spent my last\nquarter for those beastly crackers.  What's to be done? What is to be\ndone? I'll--I'll leave him my watch.  Yes, that's the only thing.\"\n\nBlix calmly took out her purse.  \"I expected it,\" she said resignedly.\n\"I knew this would happen sooner or later, and I always have been\nprepared.  How much is it, John?\" she asked of the Chinaman.\n\n\"Hefahdollah.\"\n\n\"I'll never be able to look you in the face again,\" protested Condy.\n\"I'll pay you back to-night.  I will! I'll send it up by a messenger\nboy.\"\n\n\"Then you WOULD be a buffoon.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" he exclaimed.  \"Don't, it humiliates me to the dust.\"\n\n\"Oh, come along and don't be so absurd.  It must be after five.\"\n\nHalf-way down the brass-bound stairs, he clapped his hand to his head\nwith a start.\n\n\"And NOW what is it?\" she inquired meekly.\n\n\"Forgotten, forgotten!\" he exclaimed.  \"I knew I would forget\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I knew it, you mean.\"\n\nHe ran back, and returned with the great bag of crackers, and thrust it\ninto her hands.  \"Here, here, take these.  We mustn't leave these,\" he\ndeclared earnestly.  \"It would be a shameful waste of money;\" and in\nspite of all her protests, he insisted upon taking the crackers along.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Blix, as the two skirted the Plaza, going down to\nKearney Street; \"I wonder if I ought to ask him to supper?\"\n\n\"Ask who--me?--how funny to--\"\n\n\"I wonder if we are talked out--if it would spoil the day?\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I'm going to have supper at the Club; and I've got to write my\narticle some time to-night.\"\n\nBlix fixed him with a swift glance of genuine concern.  \"Don't play\nto-night, Condy,\" she said, with a sudden gravity.\n\n\"Fat lot I can play! What money have I got to play with?\"\n\n\"You might get some somewheres.  But, anyhow, promise me you won't\nplay.\"\n\n\"Well, of course I'll promise.  How can I, if I haven't any money?  And\nbesides, I've got my whaleback stuff to write.  I'll have supper at the\nClub, and go up in the library and grind out copy for a while.\"\n\n\"Condy,\" said Blix, \"I think that diver's story is almost too good for\n'The Times.' Why don't you write it and send it East? Send it to the\nCentennial Company, why don't you? They've paid some attention to you\nnow, and it would keep your name in their minds if you sent the story\nto them, even if they didn't publish it.  Why don't you think of that?\"\n\n\"Fine--great idea! I'll do that.  Only I'll have to write it out of\nbusiness hours.  It will be extra work.\"\n\n\"Never mind, you do it; and,\" she added, as he put her on the cable\ncar, \"keep your mind on that thirty-thousand-word story of adventure.\nGood-by, Condy; haven't we had the jolliest day that ever was?\"\n\n\"Couldn't have been better.  Good-by, Blix.\"\n\nCondy returned to his club., It was about six o'clock. In response to\nhis question, the hall-boy told him that Tracy Sargeant had arrived a\nfew moments previous, and had been asking for him.\n\nThe Saturday of the week before, Condy had made an engagement with\nyoung Sargeant to have supper together that night, and perhaps go to\nthe theatre afterward.  And now at the sight of Sargeant in the \"round\nwindow\" of the main room, buried in the file of the \"Gil Blas,\" Condy\nwas pleased to note that neither of them had forgotten the matter.\n\nSargeant greeted him with extreme cordiality as he came up, and at once\nproposed a drink.  Sargeant was a sleek, well-groomed, well-looking\nfellow of thirty, just beginning to show the effects of a certain\namount of dissipation in the little puffs under the eyes and the faint\nblueness of the temples.  The sudden death of his father for which\nevent Sargeant was still mourning, had left him in such position that\nhis monthly income was about five times as large as Condy's salary.\nThe two had supper together, and Sargeant proposed the theatre.\n\n\"No, no; I've got to work to-night,\" asserted Condy.\n\nAfter dinner, while they were smoking their cigars in a window of the\nmain room, one of the hall-boys came up and touched Condy on the arm.\n\n\"Mr. Eckert, and Mr. Hendricks, and Mr. George Hands, and several other\nof those gentlemen are up in the card-room, and are asking for you and\nMr. Sargeant.\"\n\n\"Why, I didn't know the boys were here! They've got a game going,\nCondy.  Let's go up and get in.  Shall we?\"\n\nCondy remembered that he had no money.  \"I'm flat broke, Tracy,\" he\nannounced, for he knew Sargeant well enough to make the confession\nwithout wincing.  \"No, I'll not get in; but I'll go up and watch you a\nfew minutes.\"\n\nThey ascended to the card-room, where the air was heavy and acrid with\ncigar smoke, and where the silence was broken only by the click of\npoker-chips.  At the end of twenty minutes Condy was playing, having\nborrowed enough money of Sargeant to start him in the game.\n\nUnusually talkative and restless, he had suddenly hardened and\nstiffened to a repressed, tense calm; speechless, almost rigid in his\nchair.  Excitable under even ordinary circumstances, his every faculty\nwas now keyed to its highest pitch.  The nervous strain upon him was\nlike the stretching and tightening of harp-strings, too taut to quiver.\nThe color left his face, and the moisture fled his lips.  His projected\narticle, his promise to Blix, all the jollity of the afternoon, all\nthought of time or place, faded away as the one indomitable, evil\npassion of the man leaped into life within him, and lashed and roweled\nhim with excitement.  His world resolved itself to a round green table,\ncolumns of tri-colored chips, and five ever-changing cards that came\nand went and came again before his tired eyes like the changing,\nweaving colors of the kaleidoscope.  Midnight struck, then one o'clock,\nthen two, three, and four.  Still his passion rode him like a hag,\nspurring the jaded body, rousing up the wearied brain.\n\nFinally, at half-past four, at a time when Condy was precisely where he\nhad started, neither winner nor loser by so much as a dime, a round of\nJack-pots was declared, and the game broke up.  Condy walked home to\nthe uptown hotel where he lived with his mother, and went to bed as the\nfirst milk-wagons began to make their appearance and the newsboys to\ncry the morning papers.\n\nThen, as his tired eyes closed at last, occurred that strange trick of\npicture-making that the overtaxed brain plays upon the retina.  A swift\nseries of pictures of the day's doings began to whirl THROUGH rather\nthan BEFORE the pupils of his shut eyes.  Condy saw again a brief\nvision of the street, and Blix upon the corner waiting to cross; then\nit was the gay, brisk confusion of the water-front, the old mate's\ncabin aboard the whaleback, Chinatown, and a loop of vermilion cloth\nover a gallery rail, the golden balcony, the glint of the Stevenson\nship upon the green Plaza, Blix playing the banjo, the delightful and\npicturesque confusion of the deserted Chinese restaurant; Blix again,\nturning her head for him to fasten her veil, holding the ends with her\nwhite-kid fingers; Blix once more, walking at his side with her trim\nblack skirt, her round little turban hat, her yellow hair, and her\nsmall dark, dancing eyes.\n\nThen, suddenly, he remembered the promise he had made her in the matter\nof playing that night.  He winced sharply at this, and the remembrance\nof his fault harried and harassed him.  In spite of himself, he felt\ncontemptible.  Yet he had broken his promises to her in this very\nmatter of playing before--before that day of their visit to the Chinese\nrestaurant--and had felt no great qualm of self-reproach.  Had their\nrelations changed? Rather the reverse for they had done with\n\"foolishness.\"\n\n\"Never worried me before,\" muttered Condy, as he punched up his\npillow--\"never worried me before.  Why should it worry me now--worry me\nlike the devil;--and she caught on to that 'point' about the slope of\nforty-five degrees.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nCondy began his week's work for the supplement behindhand.  Naturally\nhe overslept himself Tuesday morning, and, not having any change in his\npockets, was obliged to walk down to the office.  He arrived late, to\nfind the compositors already fretting for copy.  His editor promptly\nasked for the whaleback stuff, and Condy was forced into promising it\nwithin a half-hour.  It was out of the question to write the article\naccording to his own idea in so short a time; so Condy faked the stuff\nfrom the exchange clipping, after all.  His description of the boat and\nhis comments upon her mission--taken largely at second hand--served\nonly to fill space in the paper.  They were lacking both in interest\nand in point.  There were no illustrations.  The article was a failure.\n\nBut Condy redeemed himself by a witty interview later in the week with\nan emotional actress, and by a solemn article compiled after an hour's\nreading in Lafcadio Hearn and the Encyclopedia--on the \"Industrial\nRenaissance in Japan.\"\n\nBut the idea of the diver's story came back to him again and again, and\nThursday night after supper he went down to his club, and hid himself\nat a corner desk in the library, and, in a burst of enthusiasm, wrote\nout some two thousand words of it.  In order to get the \"technical\ndetails,\" upon which he set such store, he consulted the Encyclopedias\nagain, and \"worked in\" a number of unfamiliar phrases and odd-sounding\nnames.  He was so proud of the result that he felt he could not wait\nuntil the tale was finished and in print to try its effect.  He wanted\nappreciation and encouragement upon the instant.  He thought of Blix.\n\n\"She saw the point in Morrowbie Jukes' description of the slope of the\nsandhill,\" he told himself; and the next moment had resolved to go up\nand see her the next evening, and read to her what he had written.\n\nThis was on Thursday.  All through that week Blix had kept much to\nherself, and for the first time in two years had begun to spend every\nevening at home.  In the morning of each day she helped Victorine with\nthe upstairs work, making the beds, putting the rooms to rights; or\nconsulted with the butcher's and grocer's boys at the head of the back\nstairs, or chaffered with urbane and smiling Chinamen with their\nbalanced vegetable baskets.  She knew the house and its management at\nher fingers' ends, and supervised everything that went forward.  Laurie\nFlagg coming to call upon her, on Wednesday afternoon, to remonstrate\nupon her sudden defection, found her in the act of tacking up a curtain\nacross the pantry window.\n\nBut Blix had the afternoons and evenings almost entirely to herself.\nThese hours, heretofore taken up with functions and the discharge of\nobligations, dragged not a little during the week that followed upon\nher declaration of independence.  Wednesday afternoon, however, was\nwarm and fine, and she went to the Park with Snooky.  Without looking\nfor it or even expecting it, Blix came across a little Japanese\ntea-house, or rather a tiny Japanese garden, set with almost toy\nJapanese houses and pavilions, where tea was served and thin sweetish\nwafers for five cents.  Blix and Snooky went in.  There was nobody\nabout but the Japanese serving woman.  Snooky was in raptures, and Blix\nspent a delightful half-hour there, drinking Japanese tea, and feeding\nthe wafers to the carp and gold-fish in the tiny pond immediately below\nwhere she sat.  A Chinaman, evidently of the merchant class, came in,\nwith a Chinese woman following.  As he took his place and the Japanese\ngirl came up to get his order, Blix overheard him say in English:\n\"Bring tea for-um leddy.\"\n\n\"He had to speak in English to her,\" she whispered; \"isn't that\nsplendid! Did you notice that, Snooky?\"\n\nOn the way home Blix was wondering how she should pass her evening.\nShe was to have made one of a theatre party where Jack Carter was to be\npresent.  Then she suddenly remembered \"Morrowbie Jukes,\" \"The Return\nof Imri,\" and \"Krishna Mulvaney.\" She continued on past her home,\ndowntown, and returned late for supper with \"Plain Tales\" and \"Many\nInventions.\"\n\nToward half-past eight there came a titter of the electric bell.  At\nthe moment Blix was in the upper chamber of the house of Suddhoo,\nquaking with exquisite horror at the Seal-cutter's magic.  She looked\nup quickly as the bell rang.  It was not Condy Rivers' touch.  She\nswiftly reflected that it was Wednesday night, and that she might\nprobably expect Frank Catlin.  He was a fair specimen of the Younger\nSet, a sort of modified Jack Carter, and called upon her about once a\nfortnight.  No doubt he would hint darkly as to his riotous living\nduring the past few days and refer to his diet of bromo-seltzers.  He\nwould be slangy, familiar, call her by her first name as many times as\nhe dared, discuss the last dance of the Saturday cotillion, and try to\nmake her laugh over Carter's drunkenness.  Blix knew the type.  Catlin\nwas hardly out of college; but the older girls, even the young women of\ntwenty-five or six, encouraged and petted these youngsters, driven to\nthe alternative by the absolute dearth of older men.\n\n\"I'm not at home, Victorine,\" announced Blix, intercepting the maid in\nthe hall.  It chanced that it was not Frank Catlin, but another boy of\nprecisely the same breed; and Blix returned to Suddhoo, Mrs. Hawksbee,\nand Mulvaney with a little cuddling movement of satisfaction.\n\n\"There is only one thing I regret about this,\" she said to Condy Rivers\non the Friday night of that week; \"that is, that I never thought of\ndoing it before.\" Then suddenly she put up her hand to shield her eyes,\nas though from an intense light, turning away her head abruptly.\n\n\"I say, what is it? What--what's the matter?\" he exclaimed.\n\nBlix peeped at him fearfully from between her fingers.  \"He's got it\non,\" she whispered--\"that awful crimson scarf.\"\n\n\"Hoh!\" said Condy, touching his scarf nervously, \"it's--it's very\nswell.  Is it too loud?\" he asked uneasily.\n\nBlix put her fingers in her ears; then:\n\n\"Condy, you're a nice, amiable young man, and, if you're not brilliant,\nyou're good and kind to your aged mother; but your scarfs and neckties\nare simply impossible.\"\n\n\"Well, look at this room!\" he shouted--they were in the parlor.  \"You\nneedn't talk about bad taste.  Those drapes--oh-h! those drapes!!\nYellow, s'help me! And those bisque figures that you get with every\npound of tea you buy; and this, this, THIS,\" he whimpered, waving his\nhands at the decorated sewer-pipe with its gilded cat-tails.  \"Oh,\nspeak to me of this; speak to me of art; speak to me of aesthetics.\nCat-tails, GILDED.  Of course, why not GILDED!\" He wrung his hands.\n\"'Somewhere people are happy.  Somewhere little children are at play--'\"\n\n\"Oh, hush!\" she interrupted.  \"I know it's bad; but we've always had it\nso, and I won't have it abused.  Let's go into the dining-room, anyway.\nWe'll sit in there after this.  We've always been stiff and constrained\nin here.\"\n\nThey went out into the dining-room, and drew up a couple of armchairs\ninto the bay window, and sat there looking out.  Blix had not yet\nlighted the gas--it was hardly dark enough for that; and for upward of\nten minutes they sat and watched the evening dropping into night.\n\nBelow them the hill fell away so abruptly that the roofs of the nearest\nhouses were almost at their feet; and beyond these the city tumbled\nraggedly down to meet the bay in a confused, vague mass of roofs,\ncornices, cupolas, and chimneys, blurred and indistinct in the\ntwilight, but here and there pierced by a new-lighted street lamp.\nThen came the bay.  To the east they could see Goat Island, and the\nfleet of sailing-ships anchored off the water-front; while directly in\ntheir line of vision the island of Alcatraz, with its triple crown of\nforts, started from the surface of the water.  Beyond was the Contra\nCosta shore, a vast streak of purple against the sky.  The eye followed\nits sky-line westward till it climbed, climbed, climbed up a long slope\nthat suddenly leaped heavenward with the crest of Tamalpais, purple and\nstill, looking always to the sunset like a great watching sphinx.\nThen, further on, the slope seemed to break like the breaking of an\nadvancing billow, and go tumbling, crumbling downward to meet the\nGolden Gate--the narrow inlet of green tide-water with its flanking\nPresidio.  But, further than this, the eye was stayed.  Further than\nthis there was nothing, nothing but a vast, illimitable plain of\ngreen--the open Pacific.  But at this hour the color of the scene was\nits greatest charm.  It glowed with all the sombre radiance of a\ncathedral.  Everything was seen through a haze of purple--from the low\ngreen hills in the Presidio Reservation to the faint red mass of Mount\nDiablo shrugging its rugged shoulder over the Contra Costa foot-hills.\nAs the evening faded, the west burned down to a dull red glow that\noverlaid the blue of the bay with a sheen of ruddy gold.  The\nfoot-hills of the opposite shore, Diablo, and at last even Tamalpais,\nresolved themselves in the velvet gray of the sky.  Outlines were lost.\nOnly the masses remained, and these soon began to blend into one\nanother.  The sky, and land, and the city's huddled roofs were one.\nOnly the sheen of dull gold remained, piercing the single vast mass of\npurple like the blade of a golden sword.\n\n\"There's a ship!\" said Blix in a low tone.\n\nA four-master was dropping quietly through the Golden Gate, swimming on\nthat sheen of gold, a mere shadow, specked with lights red and green.\nIn a few moments her bows were shut from sight by the old fort at the\nGate.  Then her red light vanished, then the mainmast.  She was gone.\nBy midnight she would be out of sight of land, rolling on the swell of\nthe lonely ocean under the moon's white eye.\n\nCondy and Blix sat quiet and without speech, not caring to break the\ncharm of the evening.  For quite five minutes they sat thus, watching\nthe stars light one by one, and the immense gray night settle and\nbroaden and widen from mountain-top to horizon.  They did not feel the\nnecessity of making conversation.  There was no constraint in their\nsilence now.\n\nGently, and a little at a time, Condy turned his head and looked at\nBlix.  There was just light enough to see.  She was leaning back in her\nchair, her hands fallen into her lap, her head back and a little to one\nside.  As usual, she was in black; but now it was some sort of\ndinner-gown that left her arms and neck bare.  The line of the chin and\nthe throat and the sweet round curve of the shoulder had in it\nsomething indescribable--something that was related to music, and that\neluded speech.  Her hair was nothing more than a warm colored mist\nwithout form or outline.  The sloe-brown of her little eyes and the\nflush of her cheek were mere inferences--like the faintest stars that\nare never visible when looked at directly; and it seemed to him that\nthere was disengaged from her something for which there was no name;\nsomething that appealed to a mysterious sixth sense--a sense that only\nstirred at such quiet moments as this; something that was now a dim,\nsweet radiance, now a faint aroma, and now again a mere essence, an\ninfluence, an impression--nothing more.  It seemed to him as if her\nsweet, clean purity and womanliness took a form of its own which his\naccustomed senses were too gross to perceive.  Only a certain vague\ntenderness in him went out to meet and receive this impalpable\npresence; a tenderness not for her only, but for all the good things of\nthe world.  Often he had experienced the same feeling when listening to\nmusic.  Her sweetness, her goodness, appealed to what he guessed must\nbe the noblest in him.  And she was only nineteen.  Suddenly his heart\nswelled, the ache came to his throat and the smart to his eyes.\n\n\"Blixy,\" he said, just above a whisper; \"Blixy, wish I was a better\nsort of chap.\"\n\n\"That's the beginning of being better, isn't it, Condy?\" she answered,\nturning toward him, her chin on her hand.\n\n\"It does seem a pity,\" he went on, \"that when you WANT to do the right,\nstraight thing, and be clean and fine, that you can't just BE it, and\nhave it over with.  It's the keeping it up that's the grind.\"\n\n\"But it's the keeping it up, Condy, that makes you WORTH BEING GOOD\nwhen you finally get to be good; don't you think? It's the keeping it\nup that makes you strong; and then when you get to be good you can make\nyour goodness count.  What's a good man if he's weak?--if his goodness\nis better than he is himself? It's the good man who is strong--as\nstrong as his goodness, and who can make his goodness count--who is the\nright kind of man.  That's what I think.\"\n\n\"There's something in that, there's something in that.\" Then, after a\npause: \"I played Monday night, after all, Blix, after promising I\nwouldn't.\"\n\nFor a time she did not answer, and when she spoke, she spoke quietly:\n\"Well--I'm glad you told me\"; and after a little she added, \"Can't you\nstop, Condy?\"\n\n\"Why, yes--yes, of course--I--oh, Blix, sometimes I don't know!  You\ncan't understand! How could a girl understand the power of it?  Other\nthings, I don't say; but when it comes to gambling, there seems to be\nanother me that does precisely as he chooses, whether I will or not.\nBut I'm going to do my best.  I haven't played since, although there\nwas plenty of chance.  You see, this card business is only a part of\nthis club life, this city life--like drinking and--other vices of men.\nIf I didn't have to lead the life, or if I didn't go with that\ncrowd--Sargeant and the rest of those men--it would be different;\neasier, maybe.\"\n\n\"But a man ought to be strong enough to be himself and master of\nhimself anywhere.  Condy, IS there anything in the world better or\nfiner than a strong man?\"\n\n\"Not unless it is a good woman, Blix.\"\n\n\"I suppose I look at it from a woman's point of view; but for me a\nSTRONG man--strong in everything--is the grandest thing in the world.\nWomen love strong men, Condy.  They can forgive a strong man almost\nanything.\"\n\nCondy did not immediately answer, and in the interval an idea occurred\nto Blix that at once hardened into a determination.  But she said\nnothing at the moment.  The spell of the sunset was gone and they had\nevidently reached the end of that subject of their talk.  Blix rose to\nlight the gas.  \"Will you promise me one thing, Condy?\" she said.\n\"Don't if you don't want to.  But will you promise me that you will\ntell me whenever you do play?\"\n\n\"That I'll promise you!\" exclaimed Condy; \"and I'll keep that, too.\"\n\n\"And now, let's hear the story--or what you've done of it.\"\n\nThey drew up to the dining-room table with its cover of blue denim\nedged with white cord, and Condy unrolled his manuscript and read\nthrough what he had written.  She approved, and, as he had foreseen,\n\"caught on\" to every one of his points.  He was almost ready to burst\ninto cheers when she said:\n\n\"Any one reading that would almost believe you had been a diver\nyourself, or at least had lived with divers.  Those little details\ncount, don't they? Condy, I've an idea.  See what you think of it.\nInstead of having the story end with his leaving her down there and\ngoing away, do it this way.  Let him leave her there, and then go back\nafter a long time when he gets to be an old man.  Fix it up some way to\nmake it natural.  Have him go down to see her and never come up again,\nsee? And leave the reader in doubt as to whether it was an accident or\nwhether he did it on purpose.\"\n\nCondy choked back a whoop and smote his knee.  \"Blix, you're the eighth\nwonder! Magnificent--glorious! Say!\"--he fixed her with a glance of\ncuriosity--\"you ought to take to story-writing yourself.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she retorted significantly.  \"I'll just stay with my singing\nand be content with that.  But remember that story don't go to 'The\nTimes' supplement.  At least not until you have tried it East--with the\nCentennial Company, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess NOT!\" snorted Condy.  \"Why, this is going to be one of\nthe best yarns I ever wrote.\"\n\nA little later on he inquired with sudden concern: \"Have you got\nanything to eat in the house?\"\n\n\"I never saw such a man!\" declared Blix; \"you are always hungry.\"\n\n\"I love to eat,\" he protested.\n\n\"Well, we'll make some creamed oysters; how would that do?\" suggested\nBlix.\n\nCondy rolled his eyes.  \"Oh, speak to me of creamed oysters!\" Then,\nwith abrupt solemnity: \"Blix, I never in my life had as many oysters as\nI could eat.\"\n\nShe made the creamed oysters in the kitchen over the gas-stove, and\nthey ate them there--Condy sitting on the washboard of the sink, his\nplate in his lap.\n\nCondy had a way of catching up in his hands whatever happened to be\nnearest him, and, while still continuing to talk, examining it with\napparent deep interest.  Just now it happened to be the morning's paper\nthat Victorine had left on the table.  For five minutes Condy had been\npicking it up and laying it down, frowning abstractedly at it during\nthe pauses in the conversation.  Suddenly he became aware of what it\nwas, and instantly read aloud the first item that caught his glance:\n\n\"'Personal.--Young woman, thirty-one, good housekeeper, desires\nacquaintance respectable middle-aged gentleman.  Object, matrimony.\nAddress K. D. B., this office.'--Hum!\" he commented, \"nothing equivocal\nabout K. D. B.; has the heroism to call herself young at thirty-one.\nI'll bet she IS a good housekeeper.  Right to the point.  If K. D. B.\ndon't see what she wants, she asks for it.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" mused Blix, \"what kind of people they are who put personals\nin the papers.  K. D. B., for instance; who is she, and what is she\nlike?\"\n\n\"They're not tough,\" Condy assured her.  \"I see 'em often down at 'The\nTimes' office.  They are usually a plain, matter-of-fact sort, quite\nconscientious, you know; generally middle-aged--or thirty-one; outgrown\ntheir youthful follies and illusions, and want to settle down.\"\n\n\"Read some more,\" urged Blix.  Condy went on.\n\n\"'Bachelor, good habits, twenty-five, affectionate disposition,\naccomplishments, money, desires acquaintance pretty, refined girl.\nObject, matrimony.  McB., this office.'\"\n\n\"No, I don't like McB.,\" said Blix.  \"He's too--ornamental, somehow.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't do for K. D. B., would he?\"\n\n\"Oh, my, no! He'd make her very unhappy.\"\n\n\"'Widower, two children, home-loving disposition, desires introduction\nto good, honest woman to make home for his children.  Matrimony, if\nsuitable.  B. P. T., Box A, this office.'\"\n\n\"He's not for K. D. B., that's flat,\" declared Blix; \"the idea,\n'matrimony if suitable'--patronizing enough! I know just what kind of\nan old man B. P. T. is.  I know he would want K. D. B. to warm his\nslippers, and would be fretful and grumpy.  B. P. T., just an\nabbreviation of bumptious.  No, he can't have her.\"\n\nCondy read the next two or three to himself, despite her protests.\n\n\"Condy, don't be mean! Read them to--\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"here's one for K. D. B.  Behold, the bridegroom\ncometh! Listen.\"\n\n\"'Bachelor, thirty-nine, sober and industrious, retired sea captain,\ndesires acquaintance respectable young woman, good housekeeper and\nmanager.  Object, matrimony.  Address Captain Jack, office this paper.\"\n\n\"I know he's got a wooden leg!\" cried Blix.  \"Can't you just see it\nsticking out between the lines? And he lives all alone somewhere down\nnear the bay with a parrot--\"\n\n\"And makes a glass of grog every night.\"\n\n\"And smokes a long clay pipe.\"\n\n\"But he chews tobacco.\"\n\n\"Yes, isn't it a pity he will chew that nasty, smelly tobacco? But K.\nD. B. will break him of that.\"\n\n\"Oh, is he for K. D. B.?\"\n\n\"Sent by Providence!\" declared Blix.  \"They were born for each other.\nJust see, K. D. B. is a good housekeeper, and wants a respectable\nmiddle-aged gentleman.  Captain Jack is a respectable middle-aged\ngentleman, and wants a good housekeeper.  Oh, and besides, I can read\nbetween the lines! I just feel they would be congenial.  If they know\nwhat's best for themselves, they would write to each other right away.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't you love to be there and see them meet!\" exclaimed Condy.\n\n\"Can't we fix it up some way,\" said Blix, \"to bring these two\ntogether--to help them out in some way?\"\n\nCondy smote the table and jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Write to 'em!\" he shouted.  \"Write to K. D. B. and sign it Captain\nJack, and write to Captain Jack--\"\n\n\"And sign it K. D. B.,\" she interrupted, catching his idea.\n\n\"And have him tell her, and her tell him,\" he added, \"to meet at some\nplace; and then we can go to that place and hide, and watch.\"\n\n\"But how will we know them? How would they know each other?  They've\nnever met.\"\n\n\"We'll tell them both to wear a kind of flower.  Then we can know them,\nand they can know each other.  Of course as soon as they began to talk\nthey would find out they hadn't written.\"\n\n\"But they wouldn't care.\"\n\n\"No--they want to meet each other.  They would be thankful to us for\nbringing them together.\"\n\n\"Won't it be the greatest fun?\"\n\n\"Fun! Why, it will be a regular drama.  Only we are running the show,\nand everything is real.  Let's get at it!\"\n\nBlix ran into her room and returned with writing material.  Condy\nlooked at the note-paper critically.  \"This kind's too swell.  K. D. B.\nwouldn't use Irish linen--never! Here, this is better, glazed with blue\nlines and a flying bird stamped in the corner.  Now I'll write for the\nCaptain, and you write for K. D. B.\"\n\n\"But where will we have them meet?\"\n\nThis was a point.  They considered the Chinese restaurant, the Plaza,\nLotta's fountain, the Mechanics' Library, and even the cathedral over\nin the Mexican quarter, but arrived at no decision.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of Luna's restaurant?\" said Condy.  \"By Jove, it's\njust the place! It's the restaurant where you get Mexican dinners;\nright in the heart of the Latin quarter; quiet little old-fashioned\nplace, below the level of the street, respectable as a tomb.  I was\nthere just once.  We'll have 'em meet there at seven in the evening.\nNo one is there at that hour.  The place isn't patronized much, and it\nshuts up at eight.  You and I can go there and have dinner at six, say,\nand watch for them to come.\"\n\nThen they set to work at their letters.\n\n\"Now,\" said Condy, \"we must have these sound perfectly natural, because\nif either of these people smell the smallest kind of a rat, you won't\ncatch 'em.  You must write not as YOU would write, but as you think\nTHEY would.  This is an art, a kind of fiction, don't you see? We must\nimagine a certain character, and write a letter consistent with that\ncharacter.  Then it'll sound natural.  Now, K. D. B.  Well, K. D. B.,\nshe's prim.  Let's have her prim, and proud of using correct, precise,\n'elegant' language.  I guess she wears mits, and believes in cremation.\nLet's have her believe in cremation.  And Captain Jack; oh! he's got a\nterrible voice, like this, ROW-ROW-ROW see? and whiskers, very fierce;\nand he says, 'Belay there!' and 'Avast!' and is very grandiloquent and\norotund and gallant when it comes to women.  Oh, he's the devil of a\nman when it comes to women, is Captain Jack!\"\n\nAfter countless trials and failures, they evolved the two following\nmissives, which Condy posted that night:\n\n\n\"Captain Jack.\n\n\"SIR:--I have perused with entire satisfaction your personal in 'The\nTimes.' I should like to know more of you.  I read between the lines,\nand my perception ineradicably convinces me that you are honest and\nrespectable.  I do not believe I should compromise my self-esteem at\nall in granting you an interview.  I shall be at Luna's restaurant at\nseven precisely, next Monday eve, and will bear a bunch of white\nmarguerites.  Will you likewise, and wear a marguerite in your lapel?\n\n\"Trusting this will find you in health, I am\n\n                \"Respectfully yours,\n\n                                   \"K. D. B.\"\n\n\n\n\"Miss K. D. B.\n\n\"DEAR MISS:--From the modest and retiring description of your qualities\nand character, I am led to believe that I will find in you an agreeable\nlife companion.  Will you not accord me the great favor of a personal\ninterview? I shall esteem it a high honor.  I will be at Luna's Mexican\nrestaurant at seven of the clock P.M. on Monday evening next.  May I\nexpress the fervent hope that you also will be there? I name the\nlocality because it is quiet and respectable.  I shall wear a white\nmarguerite in my buttonhole.  Will you also carry a bunch of the same\nflower?\n\n                 \"Yours to command,\n\n                             \"CAPTAIN JACK.\"\n\n\nSo great was her interest in the affair that Blix even went out with\nCondy while he mailed the letters in the nearest box, for he was quite\ncapable of forgetting the whole matter as soon as he was out of the\nhouse.\n\n\"Now let it work!\" she exclaimed as the iron flap clanked down upon the\ndisappearing envelopes.  But Condy was suddenly smitten with nameless\nmisgiving.  \"Now we've done it! now we've done it!\" he cried aghast.\n\"I wish we hadn't.  We're in a fine fix now.\"\n\nStill uneasy, he saw Blix back to the flat, and bade her good-by at the\ndoor.\n\nBut before she went to bed that night, Blix sought out her father, who\nwas still sitting up tinkering with the cuckoo clock, which he had\ntaken all to pieces under the pretext that it was out of order and went\ntoo fast.\n\n\"Papum,\" said Blix, sitting down on the rug before him, \"did you\never--when you were a pioneer, when you first came out here in the\nfifties--did you ever play poker?\"\n\n\"I--oh, well! it was the only amusement the miners had for a long time.\"\n\n\"I want you to teach me.\"\n\nThe old man let the clock fall into his lap and stared.  But Blix\nexplained her reasons.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nThe next day was Saturday, and Blix had planned a walk out to the\nPresidio.  But at breakfast, while she was debating whether she should\ntake with her Howard and Snooky, or \"Many Inventions,\" she received a\nnote from Condy, sent by special messenger:\n\n\n\"'All our fun is spoiled,' he wrote.  'I've got ptomaine poisoning from\neating the creamed oysters last night, and am in for a solid fortnight\nspent in bed.  Have passed a horrible night.  Can't you look in at the\nhotel this afternoon? My mother will be here at the time.'\"\n\n\n\"Ptomaine poisoning!\" The name had an ugly sound, and Condy's use of\nthe term inferred the doctor's visit.  Blix decided that she would put\noff her walk until the afternoon, and call on Mrs. Rivers at once, and\nask how Condy did.\n\nShe got away from the flat about ten o'clock, but on the steps outside\nmet Condy dressed as if for bicycling, and smoking a cigarette.\n\n\"I've got eleven dollars!\" he announced cheerily.\n\n\"But I thought it was ptomaine poisoning!\" she cried with sudden\nvexation.\n\n\"Pshaw! that's what the doctor says.  He's a flapdoodle; nothing but a\nkind of a sort of a pain.  It's all gone now.  I'm as fit as a\nfiddle--and I've got eleven dollars.  Let's go somewhere and do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"But your work?\"\n\n\"They don't expect me.  When I thought I was going to be sick, I\ntelephoned the office, and they said all right, that they didn't need\nme.  Now I've got eleven dollars, and there are three holidays of\nperfect weather before us: to-day, to-morrow, and Monday.  What will we\ndo? What must we do to be saved? Our matrimonial objects don't\nmaterialize till Monday night.  In the meanwhile, what? Shall we go\ndown to Chinatown--to the restaurant, or to the water-front again?\nMaybe the mate on the whaleback would invite us to lunch.  Or,\" added\nCondy, his eye caught by a fresh-fish peddler who had just turned into\nthe street, \"we can go fishing.\"\n\n\"For oysters, perhaps.\"\n\nBut the idea had caught Condy's fancy.\n\n\"Blix!\" he exclaimed, \"let's go fishing.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  Where DO people fish around here? Where there's water,\nI presume.\"\n\n\"No, is it possible?\" she asked with deep concern.  \"I thought they\nfished in their back yards, or in their front parlors perhaps.\"\n\n\"Oh, you be quiet! you're all the time guying me,\" he answered.  \"Let\nme think--let me think,\" he went on, frowning heavily, scouring at his\nhair.  Suddenly he slapped a thigh.\n\n\"Come on,\" he cried, \"I've an idea!\" He was already half-way down the\nsteps, when Blix called him back.\n\n\"Leave it all to me,\" he assured her; \"trust me IMPLICITLY.  Don't you\nwant to go?\" he demanded with abrupt disappointment.\n\n\"Want to!\" she exclaimed.  \"Why, it would be the very best kind of fun,\nbut--\"\n\n\"Well, then, come along.\"\n\nThey took a downtown car.\n\n\"I've got a couple of split bamboo rods,\" he explained as the car slid\ndown the terrific grade of the Washington-Street hill.  \"I haven't used\n'em in years--not since we lived East; but they're hand-made, and are\ntip-top.  I haven't any other kind of tackle; but it's just as well,\nbecause the tackle will all depend upon where we are going to fish.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"Don't know yet; am going down now to find out.\"\n\nHe took her down to the principal dealer in sporting goods on Market\nStreet.  It was a delicious world, whose atmosphere and charm were not\nto be resisted.  There were shot-guns in rows, their gray barrels\nlooking like so many organ-pipes; sheaves of fishing-rods, from the\nfour-ounce whisp of the brook-trout up to the rigid eighteen-ounce\nlance of the king-salmon and sea-bass; showcases of wicked revolvers,\nswelling by calibres into the thirty-eight and forty-four man-killers\nof the plainsmen and Arizona cavalry; hunting knives and dirks, and the\nslender steel whips of the fencers; files of Winchesters, sleeping\nquietly in their racks, waiting patiently for the signal to speak the\none grim word they knew; swarms of artificial flies of every\nconceivable shade, brown, gray, black, gray-brown, gray-black, with\nhere and there a brisk vermilion note; coils of line, from the\nthickness of a pencil, spun to hold the sullen plunges of a jew-fish\noff the Catalina Islands, down to the sea-green gossamers that a\nvigorous fingerling might snap; hooks, snells, guts, leaders, gaffs,\ncartridges, shells, and all the entrancing munitions of the sportsman,\nthat savored of lonely canons, deer-licks, mountain streams, quail\nuplands, and the still reaches of inlet and marsh grounds, gray and\ncool in the early autumn dawn.\n\nCondy and Blix got the attention of a clerk, and Condy explained.\n\n\"I want to go fishing--we want to go fishing.  We want some place where\nwe can go and come in the same day, and we want to catch fair-sized\nfish--no minnows.\"\n\nThe following half-hour was charming.  Never was there a clerk more\ndelightful.  It would appear that his one object in life was that Condy\nand Blix should catch fish.  The affairs of the nation stood still\nwhile he pondered, suggested, advised, and deliberated.  He told them\nwhere to go, how to get there, what train to take coming back, and who\nto ask for when they arrived.  They would have to wait till Monday\nbefore going, but could return long before the fated hour of 7 P.M.\n\n\"Ask for Richardson,\" said the clerk; \"and here, give him my card.\nHe'll put you on to the good spots; some places are A-1 to-day, and\nto-morrow in the same place you can't kill a single fish.\"\n\nCondy nudged Blix as the Mentor turned away to get his card.\n\n\"Notice that,\" he whispered: \"KILL a fish.  You don't say 'catch,' you\nsay 'kill'--technical detail.\"\n\nThen they bought their tackle: a couple of cheap reels, lines, leaders,\nsinkers, a book of assorted flies that the delightful clerk suggested,\nand a beautiful little tin box painted green, and stenciled with a\ngorgeous gold trout upon the lid, in which they were to keep the pint\nof salted shrimps to be used as bait in addition to the flies.  Blix\nwould get these shrimps at a little market near her home.\n\n\"But,\" said the clerk, \"you got to get a permit to fish in that lake.\nHave you got a pull with the Water Company? Are you a stockholder?\"\n\nCondy's face fell, and Blix gave a little gasp of dismay.  They looked\nat each other.  Here was a check, indeed.\n\n\"Well,\" said the sublime being in shirt sleeves from behind the\ncounter, \"see what you can do; and if you can't make it, come back here\nan' lemmeno, and we'll fix you up in some other place.  But Lake San\nAndreas has been bang-up this last week--been some great kills there;\nhope to the deuce you can make it.\"\n\nEverything now hinged upon this permit.  It was not until their\nexpedition had been in doubt that Condy and Blix realized how alluring\nhad been its prospects.\n\n\"Oh, I guess you can get a permit,\" said the clerk soothingly.  \"An' if\nyou make any good kills, lemmeno and I'll put it in the paper.  I'm the\neditor of the 'Sport-with-Gun-and-Rod' column in 'The Press,'\" he added\nwith a flush of pride.\n\nToward the middle of the afternoon Blix, who was waiting at home, in\ngreat suspense, for that very purpose, received another telegram from\nCondy:\n\n\n\"Tension of situation relieved.  Unconditional permission obtained.\nDon't forget the shrimps.\"\n\n\nIt had been understood that Condy was to come to the flat on Sunday\nafternoon to talk over final arrangements with Blix.  But as it was,\nSaturday evening saw him again at the Bessemers.\n\nHe had been down at his club in the library, writing the last\nparagraphs of his diver's story, when, just as he finished, Sargeant\ndiscovered him.\n\n\"Why, Conny, old man, all alone here? Let's go downstairs and have a\ncigar.  Hendricks and George Hands are coming around in half an hour.\nThey told me not to let you get away.\"\n\nCondy stirred nervously in his chair.  He knew what that meant.  He had\nenough money in his pockets to play that night, and in an instant the\nenemy was all awake.  The rowel was in his flank again, and the scourge\nat his back.  Sargeant stood there, the well-groomed clubman of thirty;\na little cynical perhaps, but a really good fellow for all that, and\nundeniably fond of Condy.  But somewhere with the eyes of some second\nself Condy saw the girl of nineteen, part child and part woman; saw her\ngoodness, her fine, sweet feminine strength as it were a dim radiance;\n\"What's a good man worth, Condy,\" she had said, \"if he's not a strong\nman?\"\n\n\"I suppose we'll have a game going before midnight,\" admitted Sargeant\nresignedly, smiling good-humoredly nevertheless.\n\nCondy set his teeth.  \"I'll join you later.  Wait a few moments,\" he\nsaid.  He hurried to the office of the club, and sent a despatch to\nBlix--the third since morning:\n\n\n\"Can I come up right away? It's urgent.  Send answer by this messenger.\"\n\n\nHe got his answer within three-quarters of an hour, and left the club\nas Hendricks and George Hands arrived by the elevator entrance.\n\nSitting in the bay window of the dining-room, he told Blix why he had\ncome.\n\n\"Oh, you were right!\" she told him.  \"Always, ALWAYS come, when--when\nyou feel you must.\"\n\n\"It gets so bad sometimes, Blix,\" he confessed with abject\nself-contempt, \"that when I can't get some one to play against I'll sit\ndown and deal dummy hands, and bet on them.  Just the touch of the\ncards--just the FEEL of the chips.  Faugh! it's shameful.\"\n\nThe day following, Sunday, Condy came to tea as usual; and after the\nmeal, as soon as the family and Victorine had left the pair alone in\nthe dining-room, they set about preparing for their morrow's excursion.\nBlix put up their lunch--sandwiches of what Condy called \"devilish\"\nham, hard-boiled eggs, stuffed olives, and a bottle of claret.\n\nCondy took off his coat and made a great show of stringing the tackle:\nwinding the lines from the spools on to the reels, and attaching the\nsinkers and flies to the leaders, smoking the while, and scowling\nfiercely.  He got the lines fearfully and wonderfully snarled, he\ncaught the hooks in the table-cloth, he lost the almost invisible gut\nleaders on the floor and looped the sinkers on the lines when they\nshould have gone on the leaders.  In the end Blix had to help him out,\ndisentangling the lines foot by foot with a patience that seemed to\nCondy little short of superhuman.\n\nAt nine o'clock she said decisively:\n\n\"Do you know what time we must get up in the morning if we are to have\nbreakfast and get the seven-forty train? Quarter of six by the latest,\nand YOU must get up earlier than that, because you're at the hotel and\nhave further to go.  Come here for breakfast, and--listen--be here by\nhalf-past six--are you LISTENING, Condy?--and we'll go down to the\ndepot from here.  Don't forget to bring the rods.\"\n\n\"I'll wear my bicycle suit,\" he said, \"and one of those golf scarfs\nthat wrap around your neck.\"\n\n\"No,\" she declared, \"I won't have it.  Wear the oldest clothes you've\ngot, but look fairly respectable, because we're to go to Luna's when we\nget back, remember.  And now go home; you need all the sleep you can\nget if you are to get up at six o'clock.\"\n\nInstead of being late, as Blix had feared, Condy was absurdly ahead of\ntime the next morning.  For a wonder, he had not forgotten the rods;\nbut he was one tremor of nervousness.  He would eat no breakfast.\n\n\"We're going to miss that train,\" he would announce from time to time;\n\"I just know it.  Blix, look what time it is.  We ought to be on the\nway to the depot now.  Come on; you don't want any more coffee.  Have\nyou got everything? Did you put the reels in the lunch-basket?--and the\nfly-book? Lord, if we should forget the fly-book!\"\n\nHe managed to get her to the depot over half an hour ahead of time.\nThe train had not even backed in, nor the ticket office opened.\n\n\"I told you, Condy, I told you,\" complained Blix, sinking helplessly\nupon a bench in the waiting-room.\n\n\"No--no--no,\" he answered vaguely, looking nervously about, his head in\nthe air.  \"We're none too soon--have more time to rest now.  I wonder\nwhat track the train leaves from.  I wonder if it stops at San Bruno.\nI wonder how far it is from San Bruno to Lake San Andreas.  I'm afraid\nit's going to rain.  Heavens and earth, Blix, we forgot the shrimps!\"\n\n\"No, NO! Sit down, I've got the shrimps.  Condy, you make me so nervous\nI shall scream in a minute.\"\n\nSome three-quarters of an hour later the train had set them down at San\nBruno--nothing more than a road-house, the headquarters for\nduck-shooters and fishermen from the city.  However, Blix and Condy\nwere the only visitors.  Everybody seemed to be especially nice to them\non that wonderful morning.  Even the supercilious ticket-seller at the\nSan Francisco depot had unbent, and wished them good luck.  The\nconductor of the train had shown himself affable.  The very brakeman\nhad gone out of his way to apprise them, quite five minutes ahead of\ntime, that \"the next stop was their place.\" And at San Bruno the\nproprietor of the road-house himself hitched up to drive them over to\nthe lake, announcing that he would call for them at \"Richardson's\" in\ntime for the evening train.\n\n\"And he only asked me four bits for both trips,\" whispered Condy to\nBlix as they jogged along.\n\nThe country was beautiful.  It was hardly eight o'clock, and the\nmorning still retained much of the brisk effervescence of the early\ndawn.  Great bare, rolling hills of gray-green, thinly scattered with\nlive-oak, bore back from the road on either hand.  The sky was pale\nblue.  There was a smell of cows in the air, and twice they heard an\nunseen lark singing.  It was very still.  The old buggy and complacent\nhorse were embalmed in a pungent aroma of old leather and of stables\nthat was entrancing; and a sweet smell of grass and sap came to them in\noccasional long whiffs.  There was exhilaration in the very thought of\nbeing alive on that odorous, still morning.  The young blood went\nspanking in the veins.  Blix's cheeks were ruddy, her little dark-brown\neyes fairly coruscating with pleasure.\n\n\"Condy, isn't it all splendid?\" she suddenly burst out.\n\n\"I feel regularly bigger,\" he declared solemnly.  \"I could do anything\na morning like this.\"\n\nThen they came to the lake, and to Richardson's, where the farmer lived\nwho was also the custodian of the lake.  The complacent horse jogged\nback, and Condy and Blix set about the serious business of the day.\nCondy had no need to show Richardson the delightful sporting clerk's\ncard.  The old Yankee--his twang and dry humor singularly incongruous\non that royal morning--was solicitude itself.  He picked out the best\nboat on the beach for them, loaned them his own anchor of railroad\niron, indicated minutely the point on the opposite shore off which the\nlast big trout had been \"killed,\" and wetted himself to his ankles as\nhe pushed off the boat.\n\nCondy took the oars.  Blix sat in the stern, jointing the rods and\nrunning the lines through the guides.  She even baited the hooks with\nthe salt shrimp herself, and by nine o'clock they were at anchor some\nforty feet off shore, and fishing, according to Richardson's advice, \"a\nleetle mite off the edge o' the weeds.\"\n\n\"If we don't get a bite the whole blessed day,\" said Condy, as he paid\nout his line to the ratchet music of the reel, \"we'll have fun just the\nsame.  Look around--isn't this great?\"\n\nThey were absolutely alone.  The day was young yet.  The lake, smooth\nand still as gray silk, widened to the west and south without so much\nas a wrinkle to roughen the surface.  Only to the east, where the sun\nlooked over a shoulder of a higher hill, it flamed up into a blinding\ndiamond iridescence.  The surrounding land lay between sky and water,\nhushed to a Sunday stillness.  Far off across the lake by Richardson's\nthey heard a dog bark, and the sound came fine and small and delicate.\nAt long intervals the boat stirred with a gentle clap-clapping of the\nwater along its sides.  From the nearby shore in the growth of\nmanzanita bushes quail called and clucked comfortably to each other; a\nbewildered yellow butterfly danced by over their heads, and slim blue\ndragon-flies came and poised on their lines and fishing-rods, bowing\ntheir backs.\n\nFrom his seat in the bow, Condy cast a glance at Blix.  She was holding\nher rod in both hands, absorbed, watchful, very intent.  She was as\ntrim as ever, even in the old clothes she had worn for the occasion.\nHer round, strong neck was as usual swathed high and tight in white,\nand the huge dog-collar girdled her waist according to her custom.  She\nhad taken off her hat.  Her yellow hair rolled back from her round\nforehead and cool pink cheeks like a veritable nimbus, and for the\nfiftieth time Condy remarked the charming contrast of her small,\ndeep-brown eyes in the midst of this white satin, yellow hair, white\nskin, and exquisite pink cheeks.\n\nAn hour passed.  Then two.\n\n\"No fish,\" murmured Condy, drawing in his line to examine the bait.\nBut, as he was fumbling with the flies he was startled by a sharp\nexclamation from Blix.\n\n\"Oh-Condy-I've-got-a-bite!\"\n\nHe looked up just in time to see the tip of her rod twitch, twitch,\ntwitch.  Then the whole rod arched suddenly, the reel sang, the line\ntautened and cut diagonally through the water.\n\n\"You got him! you got him!\" he shouted, palpitating with excitement.\n\"And he's a good one!\"\n\nBlix rose, reeling in as rapidly as was possible, the butt of the\ntwitching, living rod braced against her belt.  All at once the rod\nstraightened out again, the strain was released, and the line began to\nslant rapidly away from the boat.\n\n\"He's off!\" she cried.\n\n\"Off, nothing! HE'S GOING TO JUMP.  Look out for him, now!\"\n\nAnd then the two watching from the boat, tense and quivering with the\ndrama of the moment, saw that most inspiriting of sights--the \"break\"\nof a salmon-trout.  Up he went, from a brusque explosion of ripples and\nfoam--up into the gray of the morning from out the gray of the water:\nscales all gleaming, hackles all a-bristle; a sudden flash of silver, a\nsweep as of a scimitar in gray smoke, with a splash, a turmoil, an\nabrupt burst of troubled sound that stabbed through the silence of the\nmorning, and in a single instant dissipated all the placid calm of the\nprevious hours.\n\n\"Keep the line taut,\" whispered Condy, gritting his teeth.  \"When he\ncomes toward you, reel him in; an' if he pulls too hard, give him his\nhead.\"\n\nBlix was breathing fast, her cheeks blazing, her eyes all alight.\n\n\"Oh,\" she gasped, \"I'm so afraid I'll lose him! Oh, look at that!\" she\ncried, as the trout darted straight for the bottom, bending the rod\ntill the tip was submerged.  \"Condy, I'll lose him--I know I shall;\nyou, YOU take the rod!\"\n\n\"Not for a thousand dollars! Steady, there, he's away again! Oh, talk\nabout SPORT!\"\n\nYard by yard Blix reeled in until they began to see the silver glint of\nthe trout's flanks through the green water.  She brought him nearer.\nSwimming parallel with the boat, he was plainly visible from his\nwide-opened mouth--the hook and fly protruding from his lower jaw--to\nthe red, quivering flanges of the tail.  His sides were faintly\nspeckled, his belly white as chalk.  He was almost as long as Condy's\nforearm.\n\n\"Oh, he's a beauty! Oh, isn't he a beauty!\" murmured Condy.  \"Now,\ncareful, careful; bring him up to the boat where I can reach him;\ne-easy, Blix.  If he bolts again, let him run.\"\n\nTwice the trout shied from the boat's shadow, and twice, as Blix gave\nhim his head, the reel sang and hummed like a watch-man's rattle.  But\nthe third time he came to the surface and turned slowly on his side,\nthe white belly and one red fin out of the water, the gills opening and\nshutting.  He was tired out.  A third time Blix drew him gently to the\nboat's side.  Condy reached out and down into the water till his very\nshoulder was wet, hooked two fingers under the distended gills, and\nwith a long, easy movement of the arm swung him into the boat.\n\nTheir exultation was that of veritable children.  Condy whooped like an\nApache, throwing his hat into the air; Blix was hardly articulate, her\nhands clasped, her hair in disarray, her eyes swimming with tears of\nsheer excitement.  They shook each other's hands; they talked wildly at\nthe same time: they pounded on the boat's thwarts with their fists;\nthey laughed at their own absurdity; they looked at the trout again and\nagain, guessed at his weight, and recalled to each other details of the\nstruggle.\n\n\"When he broke that time, wasn't it grand?\"\n\n\"And when I first felt him bite! It was so sudden--why, it actually\nfrightened me.  I never--no, never in my life!\" exclaimed Blix, \"was so\nhappy as I am at this moment.  Oh, Condy, to think--just to THINK!\"\n\n\"Isn't it glory hallelujah?\"\n\n\"Isn't it better than teas, and dancing, and functions?\"\n\n\"Blix--how old are we?\"\n\n\"I don't care how old we are; I think that trout will weigh two pounds.\"\n\nWhen they were calm again, they returned to their fishing.  The morning\npassed, and it was noon before they were aware of it.  By half-past\ntwelve Blix had caught three trout, though the first was by far the\nheaviest.  Condy had not had so much as a bite.  At one o'clock they\nrowed ashore and had lunch under a huge live-oak in a little\namphitheatre of manzanita.\n\nNever had a lunch tasted so delicious.  What if the wine was warm and\nthe stuffed olives oily? What if the pepper for the hard-boiled eggs\nhad sifted all over the \"devilish\" ham sandwiches?  What if the eggs\nthemselves had not been sufficiently cooked, and the corkscrew\nforgotten? They COULD not be anything else but inordinately happy,\nsublimely gay.  Nothing short of actual tragedy could have marred the\njoy of that day.\n\nBut after they were done eating, and Blix had put away the forks and\nspoons, and while Condy was stretched upon his back smoking a cigar,\nshe said to him:\n\n\"Now, Condy, what do you say to a little game of cards with me?\"\n\nThe cigar dropped from Condy's lips, and he sat suddenly upright,\nbrushing the fallen leaves from his hair.  Blix had taken a deck of\ncards from the lunch-basket, and four rolls of chips wrapped in tissue\npaper.  He stared at her in speechless amazement.\n\n\"What do you say?\" she repeated, looking at him and smiling.\n\n\"Why, Blix!\" he exclaimed in amazement, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I say.  I want you to play cards with me.\"\n\n\"I'll not to do it,\" he declared, almost coldly.\n\n\"Listen to me, Condy,\" answered Blix; and for quite five minutes, while\nhe interrupted and protested and pshawed and argued, she talked to him\ncalmly and quietly.\n\n\"I don't ask you to stop playing, Condy,\" she said, as she finished; \"I\njust ask you that when you feel you must play--or--I mean, when you\nwant to very bad, you will come and play with me, instead of playing at\nyour club.\"\n\n\"But it's absurd, it's preposterous.  I hate to see a girl\ngambling--and you of all girls!\"\n\n\"It's no worse for me than it is for you and--well, do you suppose I\nwould play with any one else? Maybe you think I can't play well enough\nto make it interesting for you,\" she said gayly.  \"Is that it? I can\nsoon show you, Condy Rivers--never mind when I learned how.\"\n\n\"But, Blix, you don't know how often we play, those men and I.  Why, it\nis almost every--you don't know how often we play.\"\n\n\"Condy, whenever you want to play, and will play with ME, no matter\nwhat I've got in hand, I'll stop everything and play with you.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because I think, Condy, that THIS way perhaps you won't play quite so\noften at first; and then little by little perhaps--perhaps--well, never\nmind that now.  I want to play; put it that way.  But I want you to\npromise me never to play with any one else--say for six months.\"\n\nAnd in the end, whipped by a sense of shame, Condy made her the\npromise.  They became very gay upon the instant.\n\n\"Hoh!\" exclaimed Condy; \"what do YOU know of poker? I think we had best\nplay old sledge or cassino.\"\n\nBlix had dealt a hand and partitioned the chips.\n\n\"Straights and flushes BEFORE the draw,\" she announced calmly.\n\nCondy started and stared; then, looking at her askance, picked up his\nhand.\n\n\"It's up to you.\"\n\n\"I'll make it five to play.\"\n\n\"Five? Very well.  How many cards?\"\n\n\"Three.\"\n\n\"I'll take two.\"\n\n\"Bet you five more.\"\n\nBlix looked at her hand.  Then, without trace of expression in her\nvoice or face, said:\n\n\"There's your five, and I'll raise you five.\"\n\n\"Five better.\"\n\n\"And five better than that.\"\n\n\"Call you.\"\n\n\"Full house.  Aces on tens,\" said Blix, throwing down her cards.\n\n\"Heavens! they're good as gold,\" muttered Condy as Blix gathered in the\nchips.\n\nAn hour later she had won all the chips but five.\n\n\"Now we'll stop and get to fishing again; don't you want to?\"\n\nHe agreed, and she counted the chips.\n\n\"Condy, you owe me seven dollars and a half,\" she announced.\n\nCondy began to smile.  \"Well,\" he said jocosely, \"I'll send you around\na check to-morrow.\"\n\nBut at this Blix was cross upon the instant.  \"You wouldn't do\nthat--wouldn't talk that way with one of your friends at the club!\" she\nexclaimed; \"and it's not right to do it with me.  Condy, give me seven\ndollars and a half.  When you play cards with me it's just as though it\nwere with another man.  I would have paid you if you had won.\"\n\n\"But I haven't got more than nine dollars.  Who'll pay for the supper\nto-night at Luna's, and our railroad fare going home?\"\n\n\"I'll pay.\"\n\n\"But I--I can't afford to lose money this way.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't have played, then.  I took the same chances as you.  Condy,\nI want my money.\"\n\n\"You--you--why you've regularly flimflammed me.\"\n\n\"Will you give me my money?\"\n\n\"Oh, take your money then!\"\n\nBlix shut the money in her purse, and rose, dusting her dress.\n\n\"Now,\" she said--\"now that the pastime of card-playing is over, we will\nreturn to the serious business of life, which is the catching--no,\n'KILLING' of lake trout.\"\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon, Condy pulled up the anchor of\nrailroad iron and rowed back to Richardson's.  Blix had six trout to\nher credit, but Condy's ill-luck had been actually ludicrous.\n\n\"I can hold a string in the water as long as anybody,\" he complained,\n\"but I'd like to have the satisfaction of merely changing the bait\nOCCASIONALLY.  I've not had a single bite--not a nibble, y' know, all\nday.  Never mind, you got the big trout, Blix; that first one.  That\nfive minutes was worth the whole day.  It's been glorious, the whole\nthing.  We'll come down here once a week right along now.\"\n\nBut the one incident that completed the happiness of that wonderful day\noccurred just as they were getting out of the boat on the shore by\nRichardson's.  In a mud-hole between two rocks they discovered a tiny\nstriped snake, hardly bigger than a lead pencil, in the act of\nswallowing a little green frog, and they passed a rapt ten minutes in\nwitnessing the progress of this miniature drama, which culminated\nhappily in the victim's escape, and triumph of virtue.\n\n\"That,\" declared Blix as they climbed into the old buggy which was to\ntake them to the train, \"was the one thing necessary.  That made the\nday perfect.\"\n\nThey reached the city at dusk, and sent their fish, lunch-basket, and\nrods up to the Bessemers' flat by a messenger boy with an explanatory\nnote for Blix's father.\n\n\"Now,\" said Condy, \"for Luna's and the matrimonial objects.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nLuna's Mexican restaurant has no address.  It is on no particular\nstreet, at no particular corner; even its habitues, its most\nenthusiastic devotees, are unable to locate it upon demand.  It is\n\"over there in the quarter,\" \"not far from the cathedral there.\" One\ncould find it if one started out with that intent; but to direct\nanother there--no, that is out of the question.  It CAN be reached by\nfollowing the alleys of Chinatown.  You will come out of the last\nalley--the one where the slave girls are--upon the edge of the Mexican\nquarter, and by going straight forward a block or two and by keeping a\nsharp lookout to right and left you will hit upon it.  It is always to\nbe searched for.  Always to be discovered.\n\nOn that particular Monday evening Blix and Condy arrived at Luna's some\nfifteen minutes before seven.  Condy had lost himself and all sense of\ndirection in the strange streets of the quarter, and they were on the\nvery brink of despair when Blix discovered the sign upon an opposite\ncorner.\n\nAs Condy had foretold, they had the place to themselves.  They went\ninto the back room with its one mirror, six tables, and astonishing\ncurtains of Nottingham lace; and the waiter, whose name was Richard or\nRiccardo, according to taste, began to officiate at the solemn rites of\nthe \"supper Mexican.\" Condy and Blix ate with their eyes continually\nwandering to the door; and as the FRIJOLES were being served, started\nsimultaneously and exchanged glances.\n\nA man wearing two marguerites in the lapel of his coat had entered\nabruptly, and sat down to a table close at hand.\n\nCondy drew a breath of suppressed excitement.\n\n\"There he is,\" he whispered--\"Captain Jack!\"\n\nThey looked at the newcomer with furtive anxiety, and told themselves\nthat they were disappointed.  For a retired sea captain he was\ndesperately commonplace.  His hair was red, he was younger than they\nhad expected, and, worst of all, he did look tough.\n\n\"Oh, poor K. D. B.!\" sighed Blix, shaking her head.  \"He'll never do,\nI'm afraid.  Perhaps he has a good heart, though; red-headed people are\nSOMETIMES affectionate.\"\n\n\"They are impulsive,\" hazarded Condy.\n\nAs he spoke the words, a second man entered the little room.  He, too,\nsat down at a nearby table.  He, too, ordered the \"supper Mexican.\" He,\ntoo, wore marguerites in his buttonhole.\n\n\"Death and destruction!\" gasped Condy, turning pale.\n\nBlix collapsed helplessly in her chair, her hands dropping in her lap.\nThey stared at each other in utter confusion.\n\n\"Here's a how-do-you-do,\" murmured Condy, pretending to strip a TAMALE\nthat Richard had just set before him.  But Blix had pushed hers aside.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" whispered Condy across the table.  \"In Heaven's\nname, what does it mean?\"\n\n\"It can only mean one thing,\" Blix declared; \"one of them is the\ncaptain, and one is a coincidence.  Anybody might wear a marguerite; we\nought to have thought of that.\"\n\n\"But which is which?\"\n\n\"If K. D. B. should come now!\"\n\n\"But the last man looks more like the captain.\"\n\nThe last man was a sturdy, broad-shouldered fellow, who might have been\nforty.  His heavy mustache was just touched with gray, and he did have\na certain vaguely \"sober and industrious\" appearance.  But the\ndifference between the two men was slight, after all; the red-headed\nman could easily have been a sea captain, and he certainly was over\nthirty-five.\n\n\"Which? which? which?--how can we tell? We might think of some way to\nget rid of the coincidence, if we could only tell which the coincidence\nwas.  We owe it to K. D. B. In a way, Condy, it's our duty.  We brought\nher here, or we are going to, and we ought to help her all we can; and\nshe may be here at any moment.  What time is it now?\"\n\n\"Five minutes after seven.  But, Blix, I should think the right\none--the captain--would be all put out himself by seeing another chap\nhere wearing marguerites.  Does either one of 'em seem put out to you?\nLook.  I should think the captain, whichever one he is, would kind of\nGLARE at the coincidence.\"\n\nStealthily they studied the two men for a moment.\n\n\"No, no,\" murmured Blix, \"you can't tell.  Neither of them seems to\nglare much.  Oh, Condy\"--her voice dropped to a faint whisper.  \"The\nred-headed one has put his hat on a chair, just behind him, notice? Do\nyou suppose if you stood up you could see inside?\"\n\n\"What good would that do?\"\n\n\"He might have his initials inside the crown, or his whole name even;\nand you could see if he had a 'captain' before it.\"\n\nCondy made a pretence of rising to get a match in a ribbed, truncated\ncone of china that stood upon an adjacent table, and Blix held her\nbreath as he glanced down into the depths of the hat.  He resumed his\nseat.\n\n\"Only initials,\" he breathed--\"W. J. A.  It might be Jack, that J., and\nit might be Joe, or Jeremiah, or Joshua; and even if he was a captain\nhe might not use the title.  We're no better off than we were before.\"\n\n\"And K. D. B. may come at any moment.  Maybe she has come already and\nlooked through the windows, and saw TWO men with marguerites and went\naway.  She'd be just that timid.  What can we do?\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, look here,\" murmured Condy.  \"I've an idea. I'LL find\nout which the captain is.  You see that picture, that chromo, on the\nwall opposite?\"\n\nBlix looked as he indicated.  The picture was a gorgeously colored\nlithograph of a pilot-boat, schooner-rigged, all sails set, dashing\nbravely through seas of emerald green color.\n\n\"You mean that schooner?\" asked Blix.\n\n\"That schooner, exactly.  Now, listen.  You ask me in a loud voice what\nkind of a boat that is; and when I answer, you keep your eye on the two\nmen.\"\n\n\"Why, what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"You'll see.  Try it now; we've no time to lose.\"\n\nBlix shifted in her seat and cleared her throat.  Then:\n\n\"What a pretty boat that is up there, that picture on the wall.  See\nover there, on the wall opposite? Do you notice it? Isn't she pretty?\nCondy, tell me what kind of a boat is that?\"\n\nCondy turned about in his place with great deliberation, fixed the\npicture with a judicial eye, and announced decisively:\n\n\"That?--why, that's a BARKENTINE.\"\n\nCondy had no need to wait for Blix's report.  The demonstration came\nfar too quickly for that.  The red-headed man at his loud declaration\nmerely   glanced in the direction of the chromo and returned to his\nenchellados.  But he of the black mustache followed Condy's glance,\nnoted the picture of which he spoke, and snorted contemptuously.  They\neven heard him mutter beneath his mustache:\n\n\"BARKENTINE your eye!\"\n\n\"No doubt as to which is the captain now,\" whispered Condy so soon as\nthe other had removed from him a glance of withering scorn.\n\nThey could hardly restrain their gayety; but their gravity promptly\nreturned when Blix kicked Condy's foot under the table and murmured:\n\"He's looking at his watch, the captain is.  K. D.  B. isn't here yet,\nand the red-headed man, the coincidence, is.  We MUST get rid of him.\nCondy, can't you think of something?\"\n\n\"Well, he won't go till he's through his supper, you can depend upon\nthat.  If he's here when K. D. B. arrives, it will spoil everything.\nShe wouldn't stay a moment.  She wouldn't even come in.\"\n\n\"Isn't it disappointing? And I had so counted upon bringing these two\ntogether! And Captain Jack is a nice man!\"\n\n\"You can see that with one hand tied behind you,\" whispered Condy.\n\"The other chap's tough.\"\n\n\"Looks just like the kind of man to get into jail sooner or later.\"\n\n\"Maybe he's into some mischief now; you never can tell.  And the\nMexican quarter of San Francisco is just the place for 'affairs.' I'll\nwarrant he's got PALS.\"\n\n\"Well, here he is--that's the main point--just keeping those people\napart, spoiling a whole romance.  Maybe ruining their lives.  It's\nQUITE possible; really it is.  Just stop and think.  This is a positive\ncrisis we're looking at now.\"\n\n\"Can't we get rid of him SOMEHOW?\"\n\n\"O-oh!\" whispered Blix, all at once, in a quiver of excitement.  \"There\nis a way, if we'd ever have the courage to do it.  It might work; and\nif it didn't, he'd never know the difference, never would suspect us.\nOh! but we wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"What? what? In Heaven's name what is it, Blix?\"\n\n\"We wouldn't dare--we couldn't.  Oh! but it would be such--\"\n\n\"K. D. B. may come in that door at any second.\"\n\n\"I'm half afraid, but all the same--Condy, let me have a pencil.\" She\ndashed off a couple of lines on the back of the bill of fare, and her\nhand trembled like a leaf as she handed him what she had written.\n\n\"Send him--the red-headed man--that telegram.  There's an office just\ntwo doors below here, next the drug-store.  I saw it as we came by.\nYou know his initials: remember, you saw them in his hat.  W. J. A.,\nLuna's restaurant.  That's all you want.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" muttered Condy, as he gazed upon what Blix had written.\n\n\"Do you dare?\" she whispered, with a little hysterical shudder.\n\n\"If it failed we've nothing to lose.\"\n\n\"And K. D. B. is coming nearer every instant!\"\n\n\"But would he go--that is, at once?\"\n\n\"We can only try.  You won't be gone a hundred seconds.  You can leave\nme here that length of time.  Quick, Condy; decide one way or the\nother.  It's getting desperate.\"\n\nCondy reached for his hat.\n\n\"Give me some money, then,\" he said.  \"You won all of mine.\"\n\nA few moments later he was back again and the two sat, pretending to\neat their chili peppers, their hearts in their throats, hardly daring\nto raise their eyes from their plates.  Condy was actually sick with\nexcitement, and all but tipped the seltzer bottle to the floor when a\nmessenger boy appeared in the outer room.  The boy and the proprietor\nheld a conference over the counter.  Then Richard appeared between the\nportieres of Nottingham lace, the telegram in his hand and the boy at\nhis heels.\n\nEvidently Richard knew the red-headed man, for he crossed over to him\nat once with the words:\n\n\"I guess this is for you, Mr. Atkins?\"\n\nHe handed him the despatch and retired.  The red-headed man signed the\nreceipt; the boy departed.  Blix and Condy heard the sound of torn\npaper as the red-headed man opened the telegram.\n\nTen seconds passed, then fifteen, then twenty.  There was a silence.\nCondy dared to steal a glance at the red-headed man's reflection in the\nmirror.  He was studying the despatch, frowning horribly.  He put it\naway in his pocket, took it out again with a fierce movement of\nimpatience, and consulted it a second time.  His \"supper Mexican\"\nremained untasted before him; Condy and Blix heard him breathing loud\nthrough his nose.  That he was profoundly agitated, they could not\ndoubt for a single moment.  All at once a little panic terror seemed to\ntake possession of him.  He rose, seized his hat, jammed it over his\nears, slapped a half-dollar upon the table, and strode from the\nrestaurant.\n\nThis is what the read-headed man had read in the despatch; this is what\nBlix had written:\n\n\n\"ALL IS DISCOVERED.  FLY AT ONCE.\"\n\n\nAnd never in all their subsequent rambles about the city did Blix or\nCondy set eyes upon the red-headed man again, nor did Luna's\nrestaurant, where he seemed to have been a habitue, ever afterward know\nhis presence.  He disappeared; he was swallowed up.  He had left the\nrestaurant, true.  Had he also left that neighborhood?  Had he fled the\ncity, the State, the country even? What skeleton in the red-headed\nman's closet had those six words called to life and the light of day.\nHad they frightened him forth to spend the rest of his days fleeing\nfrom an unnamed, unknown avenger--a veritable wandering Jew? What\nmystery had they touched upon there in the bald, bare back room of the\nQuarter's restaurant? What dark door had they opened, what red-headed\nphantom had they evoked? Had they broken up a plot, thwarted a\nconspiracy, prevented a crime?  They never knew.  One thing only was\ncertain.  The red-headed man had had a past.\n\nMeanwhile the minutes were passing, and K. D. B. still failed to\nappear.  Captain Jack was visibly growing impatient, anxious.  By now\nhe had come to the fiery liqueur called mescal.  He was nearly through\nhis supper.  At every moment he consulted his watch and fixed the\noutside door with a scowl.  It was already twenty minutes after seven.\n\n\"I know the red-headed man spoiled it, after all,\" murmured Blix.  \"K.\nD. B. saw the two of them in here and was frightened.\"\n\n\"We could send Captain Jack a telegram from her,\" suggested Condy.\n\"I'm ready for anything now.\"\n\n\"What could you say?\"\n\n\"Oh, that she couldn't come.  Make another appointment.\"\n\n\"He'd be offended with her.  He'd never make another appointment.  Sea\ncaptains are always so punctilious, y' know.\"\n\nRichard brought them their coffee and kirsch, and Condy showed Blix how\nto burn a lump of sugar and sweeten the coffee with syrup.  But they\nwere disappointed.  Captain Jack was getting ready to leave.  K. D. B.\nhad evidently broken the appointment.\n\nThen all at once she appeared.\n\nThey knew it upon the instant by a brisk opening and shutting of the\nstreet door, and by a sudden alertness on the part of Captain Jack,\nwhich he immediately followed by a quite inexplicable move.  The street\ndoor in the outside room had hardly closed before his hand shot to his\ncoat lapel and tore out the two marguerites.\n\nThe action was instinctive; Blix knew it for such immediately.  The\nretired captain had not premeditated it.  He had not seen the face of\nthe newcomer.  She had not time to come into the back room, or even to\nclose the street door.  But the instant that the captain had recognized\na bunch of white marguerites in her belt he had, without knowing why,\nbeen moved to conceal his identity.\n\n\"He's afraid,\" whispered Blix.  \"Positively, I believe he's afraid.\nHow absolutely stupid men are!\"\n\nBut meanwhile, K. D. B., the looked-for, the planned-for and\nintrigued-for; the object of so much diplomacy, such delicate\nmanoeuvring; the pivot upon which all plans were to turn, the\nstorm-centre round which so many conflicting currents revolved, and for\nwhose benefit the peace of mind of the red-headed man had been forever\nbroken up--had entered the room.\n\n\"Why, she's PRETTY!\" was Blix's first smothered exclamation, as if she\nhad expected a harridan.\n\nK. D. B. looked like a servant-girl of the better sort, and was really\nvery neatly dressed.  She was small, little even.  She had snappy black\neyes, a resolute mouth, and a general air of being very quiet, very\nmatter-of-fact and complacent.  She would be disturbed at nothing,\nexcited at nothing; Blix was sure of that.  She was placid, but it was\nthe placidity not of the absence of emotion, but of emotion disdained.\nNot the placidity of the mollusk, but that of a mature and\ncontemplative cat.\n\nQuietly she sat down at a corner table, quietly she removed her veil\nand gloves, and quietly she took in the room and its three occupants.\n\nCondy and Blix glued their eyes upon their coffee cups like guilty\nconspirators; but a crash of falling crockery called their attention to\nthe captain's table.\n\nCaptain Jack was in a tremor.  Hitherto he had acted the role of a sane\nand sensible gentleman of middle age, master of himself and of the\nsituation.  The entrance of K. D. B. had evidently reduced him to a\nsemi-idiotic condition.  He enlarged himself; he eased his neck in his\ncollar with a rotary movement of head and shoulders.  He frowned\nterribly at trifling objects in corners of the room.  He cleared his\nthroat till the glassware jingled.  He pulled at his mustache.  He\nperspired, fumed, fretted, and was suddenly seized with an insane\ndesire to laugh.  Once only he caught the eye of K. D. B., calmly\nsitting in her corner, picking daintily at her fish, whereupon he\nimmediately overturned the vinegar and pepper casters upon the floor.\nJust so might have behaved an overgrown puppy in the presence of a\nsleepy, unperturbed chessy-cat, dozing by the fire.\n\n\"He ought to be shaken,\" murmured Blix at the end of her patience.\n\"Does he think SHE is going to make the first move?\"\n\n\"Ha, ah'm!\" thundered the captain, clearing his throat for the\ntwentieth time, twirling his mustache, and burying his scarlet face in\nan enormous pocket handkerchief.\n\nFive minutes passed and he was still in his place.  From time to time\nK. D. B. fixed him with a quiet, deliberate look, and resumed her\ndelicate picking.\n\n\"Do you think she knows it's he, now that he's taken off his\nmarguerites?\" whispered Condy.\n\n\"Know it?--of course she does! Do you think women are absolutely BLIND,\nor so imbecile as men are? And, then, if she didn't think it was he,\nshe'd go away.  And she's so really pretty, too.  He ought to thank his\nstars alive.  Think what a fright she might have been! She doesn't LOOK\nthirty-one.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" returned Condy.  \"As long as she SAID she was thirty-one, you\ncan bet everything you have that she is; that's as true as revealed\nreligion.\"\n\n\"Well, it's something to have seen the kind of people who write the\npersonals,\" said Blix.  \"I had always imagined that they were kind of\ntough.\"\n\n\"You see they are not,\" he answered.  \"I told you they were not.\nMaybe, however, we have been exceptionally fortunate.  At any rate,\nthese are respectable enough.\"\n\n\"Not the least doubt about that.  But why don't he do something, that\ncaptain?\" mourned Blix.  \"Why WILL he act like such a ninny?\"\n\n\"He's waiting for us to go,\" said Condy; \"I'm sure of it.  They'll\nnever meet so long as we're here.  Let's go and give 'em a chance.  If\nyou leave the two alone here, one or the other will HAVE to speak.  The\nsuspense would become too terrible.  It would be as though they were on\na desert island.\"\n\n\"But I wanted to SEE them meet,\" she protested.\n\n\"You wouldn't hear what they said.\"\n\n\"But we'd never know if they did meet, and oh--and WHO spoke first?\"\n\n\"She'll speak first,\" declared Condy.\n\n\"Never!\" returned Blix, in an indignant whisper.\n\n\"I tell you what.  We could go and then come back in five minutes.\nI'll forget my stick here.  Savvy?\"\n\n\"You would probably do it anyhow,\" she told him.\n\nThey decided this would be the better course.  They got together their\nthings, and Condy neglected his stick, hanging upon a hook on the wall.\n\nAt the counter in the outside room, Blix, to the stupefaction of\nRichard, the waiter, paid the bill.  But as she was moving toward the\ndoor, Condy called her back.\n\n\"Remember the waiter,\" he said severely, while Richard grinned and\nbobbed.  \"Fifty cents is the very least you could tip him.\" Richard\nactually protested, but Condy was firm, and insisted upon a half-dollar\ntip.\n\n\"Noblesse oblige,\" he declared with vast solemnity.\n\nThey walked as far as the cathedral, listened for a moment to the bell\nstriking the hour of eight; then as they remembered that the restaurant\nclosed at that time, hurried back and entered the outside room in\nfeigned perturbation.\n\n\"Did I, could I have possibly left my stick here?\" exclaimed Condy to\nRichard, who was untying his apron behind the counter.  But Richard had\nnot noticed.\n\n\"I think I must have left it back here where we were sitting.\"\n\nCondy stepped into the back room, Blix following.  They got his stick\nand returned to the outside room.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I did leave it,\" he said, as he showed it to Richard.  \"I'm\nalways leaving that stick wherever I go.\"\n\n\"Come again,\" said Richard, as he bowed them out of the door.\n\nOn the curb outside Condy and Blix shook hands and congratulated each\nother on the success of all their labors.  In the back room, seated at\nthe same table, a bunch of wilting marguerites between them, they had\nseen their \"matrimonial objects\" conferring earnestly together,\nabsorbed in the business of getting acquainted.\n\nBlix heaved a great sigh of relief and satisfaction, exclaiming:\n\n\"At last K. D. B. and Captain Jack have met!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n\"But,\" she added, as they started to walk, \"we will never know which\none spoke first.\"\n\nBut Condy was already worrying.\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know!\" he murmured anxiously.  \"Perhaps we've\ndone an awful thing.  Suppose they aren't happy together after they're\nmarried? I wish we hadn't; I wish we hadn't now.  We've been playing a\ngame of checkers with human souls.  We've an awful responsibility.\nSuppose he kills her some time?\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks, Condy! And, besides, if we've done wrong with our\nmatrimonial objects, we've offset it by doing well with our red-headed\ncoincidence.  How do you know, you may have 'foiled a villain' with\nthat telegram--prevented a crime?\"\n\nCondy grinned at the recollection of the incident.\n\n\"'Fly at once,'\" he repeated.  \"I guess he's flying yet.  'All is\ndiscovered.' I'd give a dollar and a half--\"\n\n\"If you had it?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if I had it--to know just what it was we have discovered.\"\n\nSuddenly Blix caught his arm.\n\n\"Condy, here they come!\"\n\n\"Who? Who?\"\n\n\"Our objects, Captain Jack and K. D. B.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.  They couldn't stay.  The restaurant shuts up at\neight.\"\n\nBlix and Condy had been walking slowly in the direction of Pacific\nStreet, and K. D. B. and her escort soon overtook them going in the\nsame direction.  As they passed, the captain was saying:\n\n\"--jumped on my hatches, and says we'll make it an international\naffair.  That didn't--\"\n\nA passing wagon drowned the sound of his voice.\n\n\"He was telling her of his adventures!\" cried Blix.  \"Splendid!\nOthello and Desdemona.  They're getting on.\"\n\n\"Let's follow them!\" exclaimed Condy.\n\n\"Should we? Wouldn't it be indiscreet?\"\n\n\"No.  We are the arbiters of their fate; we MUST take an interest.\"\n\nThey allowed their objects to get ahead some half a block and then fell\nin behind.  There was little danger of their being detected.  The\ncaptain and K. D. B. were absorbed in each other.  She had even taken\nhis arm.\n\n\"They make a fine-looking couple, really,\" said Blix.  \"Where do you\nsuppose they are going? To another restaurant?\"\n\nBut this was not the case.  Blix and Condy followed them as far as\nWashington Square, where the Geodetic Survey stone stands, and the\nenormous flagstaff; and there in front of a commonplace little house,\ntwo doors above the Russian church with its minarets like inverted\nballoons K. D. B. and the captain halted.  For a few moments they\nconversed in low tones at the gate, then said good-night, K. D. B.\nentering the house, the captain bowing with great deference, his hat in\nhis hand.  Then he turned about, glanced once or twice at the house,\nset his hat at an angle, and disappeared across the square, whistling a\ntune, his chin in the air.\n\n\"Very good, excellent, highly respectable,\" approved Blix; and Condy\nhimself fetched a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it might have been worse.\"\n\n\"We'll never see them again, our 'Matrimonial Objects,'\" said Blix,\n\"and they'll never know about us; but we have brought them together.\nWe've started a romance.  Yes, I think we've done a good day's work.\nAnd now, Condy, I think we had best be thinking of home ourselves.  I'm\njust beginning to get most awfully sleepy.  What a day we've had!\"\n\nA sea fog, or rather THE sea fog--San Francisco's old and inseparable\ncompanion--had gathered by the time they reached the top of the\nWashington Street hill.  Everything was wet with it.  The asphalt was\nlike varnished ebony.  Indistinct masses and huge dim shadows stood for\nthe houses on either side.  From the eucalyptus trees and the palms the\nwater dripped like rain.  Far off oceanward, the fog-horn was lowing\nlike a lost gigantic bull.  The gray bulk of a policeman--the light\nfrom the street lamp reflected in his star--loomed up on the corner as\nthey descended from the car.\n\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\n\nCondy had intended to call his diver's story \"A Submarine Romance,\" but\nBlix had disapproved.\n\n\"It's too 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,'\" she had said.  \"You\nwant something much more dignified.  There is that about you, Condy,\nyou like to be too showy; you don't know when to stop.  But you have\nleft off red-and-white scarfs, and I am very glad to see you wearing\nwhite shirt-fronts instead of pink ones.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I thought it would be quieter,\" he had answered, as though\nthe idea had come from him.  Blix allowed him to think so.\n\nBut \"A Victory Over Death,\" as the story was finally called, was a\nsuccess.  Condy was too much of a born story-teller not to know when he\nhad done something distinctly good.  When the story came back from the\ntypewriter's, with the additional strength that print lends to fiction,\nand he had read it over, he could not repress a sense of jubilation.\nThe story rang true.\n\n\"Bully, bully!\" he muttered between his teeth as he finished the last\nparagraph.  \"It's a corker! If it's rejected everywhere, it's an\nout-of-sight yarn just the same.\"\n\nAnd there Condy's enthusiasm in the matter began to dwindle.  The fine\nfire which had sustained him during the story's composition had died\nout.  He was satisfied with his work.  He had written a good story, and\nthat was the end of it.  No doubt he would send it East--to the\nCentennial Company--to-morrow or the day after--some time that week.\nTo mail the manuscript meant quite half an hour's effort.  He would\nhave to buy stamps for return postage; a letter would have to be\nwritten, a large envelope procured, the accurate address ascertained.\nFor the moment his supplement work demanded his attention.  He put off\nsending the story from day to day.  His interest in it had abated.  And\nfor that matter he soon discovered he had other things to think of.\n\nIt had been easy to promise Blix that he would no longer gamble at his\nclub with the other men of his acquaintance; but it was \"death and the\ndevil,\" as he told himself, to abide by that promise.  More than once\nin the fortnight following upon his resolution he had come up to the\nlittle flat on the Washington Street hill as to a place of refuge; and\nBlix, always pretending that it was all a huge joke and part of their\ngood times, had brought out the cards and played with him.  But she\nknew very well the fight he was making against the enemy, and how hard\nit was for him to keep from the round green tables and group of silent\nshirt-sleeved men in the card-rooms of his club.  She looked forward to\nthe time when Condy would cease to play even with her.  But she was too\nsensible and practical a girl to expect him to break a habit of years'\nstanding in a couple of weeks.  The thing would have to be accomplished\nlittle by little.  At times she had misgivings as to the honesty of the\ncourse she had adopted.  But nowadays, playing as he did with her only,\nCondy gambled but two or three evenings in the week, and then not for\nmore than two hours at a time.  Heretofore hardly an evening that had\nnot seen him at the round table in his club's card-room, whence he had\nnot risen until long after midnight.\n\nCondy had told young Sargeant that he had \"reformed\" in the matter of\ngambling, and intended to swear off for a few months.  Sargeant, like\nthe thoroughbred he was, never urged him to play after that, and never\nspoke of the previous night's game when Condy was about.  The other men\nof his \"set\" were no less thoughtful, and, though they rallied him a\nlittle at first upon his defection, soon let the matter drop.  Condy\ntold himself that there were plenty of good people in the world, after\nall.  Every one seemed conspiring to make it easy for him, and he swore\nat himself for a weak-kneed cad.\n\nOn a certain Tuesday, about a week after the fishing excursion and the\naffair of the \"Matrimonial Objects,\" toward half-past six in the\nevening, Condy was in his room, dressing for a dinner engagement.\nYoung Sargeant's sister had invited him to be one of a party who were\nto dine at the University Club, and later on fill a box at a charity\nplay, given by amateurs at one of the downtown theatres.  But as he was\nwashing his linen shirt-studs with his tooth-brush his eye fell upon a\nnote, in Laurie Flagg's handwriting, that lay on his writing-desk, and\nthat he had received some ten days previous.  Condy turned cold upon\nthe instant, hurled the tooth-brush across the room, and dropped into a\nchair with a groan of despair.  Miss Flagg was giving a theatre party\nfor the same affair, and he remembered now that he had promised to join\nher party as well, forgetting all about the engagement he had made with\nMiss Sargeant.  It was impossible at this late hour to accept either\none of the young women's invitations without offending the other.\n\n\"Well, I won't go to EITHER, that's all,\" he vociferated aloud to the\nopposite wall.  \"I'll send 'em each a wire, and say that I'm sick or\nhave got to go down to the office, and--and, by George!  I'll go up and\nsee Blix, and we'll read and make things to eat.\"\n\nAnd no sooner had this alternative occurred to him than it appeared too\nfascinating to be resisted.  A weight seemed removed from his mind.\nWhen it came to that, what amusement would he have at either affair?\n\n\"Sit up there with your shirt-front starched like a board,\" he\nblustered, \"and your collar throttling you, and smile till your face is\nsore, and reel off small talk to a girl whose last name you can't\nremember! Do I have any fun, does it do me any good, do I get ideas for\nyarns? What do I do it for? I don't know.\"\n\nWhile speaking he had been kicking off his tight shoes and such of his\nfull dress as he had already put on, and with a feeling of enormous\nrelief turned again to his sack suit of tweed.  \"Lord, these feel\nbetter!\" he exclaimed, as he substituted the loose business suit for\nthe formal rigidity of his evening dress.  It was with a sensation of\npositive luxury that he put on a \"soft\" shirt of blue cheviot and his\ntan walking-shoes.\n\n\"But no more red scarfs,\" he declared, as he knotted his black satin\n\"club\" before the mirror.  \"She WAS right there.\" He put his cigarettes\nin his pocket, caught up his gloves and stick, clapped on his hat, and\nstarted for the Bessemers' flat with a feeling of joyous expectancy he\nhad not known for days.\n\nEvidently Blix had seen him coming, for she opened the door herself;\nand it suited her humor for the moment to treat him as a peddler or\nbook-agent.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said airily, her head in the air as she held the door.\n\"No, we don't want any to-day.  We HAVE the biography of Abraham\nLincoln.  Don't want to subscribe to any Home Book of Art.  We're not\nartistic; we use drapes in our parlors.  Don't want 'The Wives and\nMothers of Great Men.'\"\n\nBut Condy had noticed a couple of young women on the lower steps of the\nadjacent flat, quite within ear-shot, and at once he began in a loud,\nharsh voice:\n\n\"Well, y' know, we can't wait for our rent forever; I'm only the\ncollector, and I've nothing to do with repairs.  Pay your rent that's\nthree months overdue, and then--\"\n\nBut Blix pulled him within the house and clapped to the door.\n\n\"Condy RIVERS!\" she exclaimed, her cheeks flaming, \"those are our\nneighbors.  They heard every word.  What do you suppose they think?\"\n\n\"Huh! I'd rather have 'em think I was a rent-collector than a\nbook-agent.  You began it.  'Evenin', Miss Lady.\"\n\n\"'Evenin', Mister Man.\"\n\nBut Condy's visit, begun thus gayly, soon developed along much more\nserious lines.  After supper, while the light still lasted, Blix read\nstories to him while he smoked cigarettes in the bay window of the\ndining-room.  But as soon as the light began to go she put the book\naside, and the two took their accustomed places in the window, and\nwatched the evening burning itself out over the Golden Gate.\n\nIt was just warm enough to have one of the windows opened, and for a\nlong time after the dusk they sat listening to the vague clamor of the\ncity, lapsing by degrees, till it settled into a measured, soothing\nmurmur, like the breathing of some vast monster asleep.  Condy's\ncigarette was a mere red point in the half-darkness.  The smoke drifted\nout of the open window in long, blue strata.  At his elbow Blix was\nleaning forward, looking down upon the darkening, drowsing city, her\nround, strong chin propped upon her hand. She was just close enough for\nCandy to catch the sweet, delicious feminine perfume that came\nindefinitely from her clothes, her hair, her neck.  From where Condy\nsat he could see the silhouette of her head and shoulders against the\ndull golden blur of the open window; her round, high forehead, with the\nthick yellow hair rolling back from her temples and ears, her pink,\nclean cheeks, her little dark-brown, scintillating eyes, and her firm\nred mouth, made all the firmer by the position of her chin upon her\nhand.  As ever, her round, strong neck was swathed high and tight in\nwhite satin; but between the topmost fold of the satin and the rose of\none small ear-lobe was a little triangle of white skin, that was partly\nher neck and partly her cheek, and that Condy knew should be softer\nthan down, smoother than satin, warm and sweet and redolent as new\napples.  Condy imagined himself having the right to lean toward her\nthere and kiss that little spot upon her neck or her cheek; and as he\nfancied it, was surprised to find his breath come suddenly quick, and a\nbarely perceptible qualm, as of a certain faintness, thrill him to his\nfinger-tips; and then, he thought, how would it be if he could, without\nfear of rebuff, reach out his arm and put it about her trim, firm\nwaist, and draw her very close to him, till he should feel the satiny\ncoolness of her smooth cheek against his; till he could sink his face\nin the delicious, fragrant confusion of her hair, then turn that face\nto his--that face with its strong, calm mouth and sweet, full lips--\nthe face of this dear young girl of nineteen, and then--\n\n\"I say--I--shall we--let's read again.  Let's--let's do something.\"\n\n\"Condy, how you frightened me!\" exclaimed Blix, with a great start.\n\"No, listen: I want to talk to you, to tell you something.  Papum and I\nhave been having some very long and serious talks since you were last\nhere.  What do you think, I may go away.\"\n\n\"The deuce you say!\" exclaimed Condy, sitting suddenly upright.  \"Where\nto, in Heaven's name?\" he added--\"and when? and what for?\"\n\n\"To New York, to study medicine.\"\n\nThere was a silence; then Condy exclaimed, waving his hands at her:\n\n\"Oh, go right on! Don't mind me.  Little thing like going to New\nYork--to study medicine.  Of course, that happens every day, a mere\ndetail.  I presume you'll go back and forth for your meals?\"\n\nThen Blix began to explain.  It appeared that she had two aunts, both\nsisters of her father--one a widow, the other unmarried.  The widow, a\ncertain Mrs. Kihm, lived in New York, and was wealthy, and had views on\n\"women's sphere of usefulness.\" The other, Miss Bessemer, a little old\nmaid of fifty, Condy had on rare occasions seen at the flat, where\nevery one called her Aunt Dodd.  She lived in that vague region of the\ncity known as the Mission, where she owned a little property.\n\nFrom what Blix told him that evening, Condy learned that Mrs. Kihm had\nvisited the coast a few winters previous and had taken a great fancy to\nBlix.  Even then she had proposed to Mr. Bessemer to take Blix back to\nNew York with her, and educate her to some woman's profession; but at\nthat time the old man would not listen to it.  Now it seemed that the\nopportunity had again presented itself.\n\n\"She's a dear old lady,\" Blix said; \"not a bit strong-minded, as you\nwould think, and ever so much cleverer than most men.  She manages all\nher property herself.  For the last month she's been writing again to\nPapum for me to come on and stay with her three, or four years.  She\nhasn't a chick nor a child, and she don't entertain or go out any, so\nmaybe she feels lonesome.  Of course if I studied there, Papum wouldn't\nthink of Aunt Kihm--don't you know--paying for it all.  I wouldn't go\nif it was that way.  But I could stay with her and she could make a\nhome for me while I was there--if I should study--anything--study\nmedicine.\"\n\n\"But why!\" he exclaimed.  \"What do you want to study to be a doctor\nfor? It isn't as though you had to support yourself.\"\n\n\"I know, I know I've not got to support myself.  But why shouldn't I\nhave a profession just like a man--just like you, Condy? You stop and\nthink.  It seemed strange to me when I first thought of it; but I got\nthinking about it and talking it over with Papum, and I should LOVE it.\nI'd do it, not because I would have to do it, but because it would\ninterest me.  Condy, you know that I'm not a bit strong-minded, and\nthat I hate a masculine, unfeminine girl as much as you do.\"\n\n\"But a medical college, Blix! You don't know what you are talking\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.  There's a college in New York just for women.  Aunt Kihm\nsent me the prospectus, and it's one of the best in the country.  I\ndon't dream of practicing, you know; at least, I don't think about that\nnow.  But one must have some occupation; and isn't studying medicine,\nCondy, better than piano-playing, or French courses, or literary\nclasses and Browning circles? Oh, I've no patience with that kind of\ngirl! And look at the chance I have now; and Aunt Kihm is such a dear!\nThink, she writes, I could go to and from the college in her coupe\nevery day, and I would see New York; and just being in a big city like\nthat is an education.\"\n\n\"You're right, it would be a big thing for you,\" assented Condy, \"and I\nlike the idea of you studying something.  It would be the making of\nsuch a girl as you, Blix.\"\n\nAnd then Blix, seeing him thus acquiescent, said:\n\n\"Well, it's all settled; Papum and I both wrote last night.\"\n\n\"When are you going?\"\n\n\"The first week in January.\"\n\n\"Well, that's not so AWFULLY soon.  But who will take your place here?\nHowever in the world would your father get along without you--and\nSnooky and Howard?\"\n\n\"Aunt Dodd is going to come.\"\n\n\"Sudden enough,\" said Condy, \"but it IS a great thing for you, Blix,\nand I'm mighty glad for you.  Your future is all cut out for you now.\nOf course your aunt, if she's so fond of you and hasn't any children,\nwill leave you everything--maybe settle something on you right away;\nand you'll marry some one of those New York chaps, and be great big\npeople before you know it.\"\n\n\"The idea, Condy!\" she protested.  \"No; I'm going there to study\nmedicine.  Oh, you don't know how enthusiastic I am over the idea!\nI've bought some of the first-year books already, and have been reading\nthem.  Really, Condy, they are even better than 'Many Inventions.'\"\n\n\"Wish I could get East,\" muttered Condy gloomily.  Blix forgot her own\ngood fortune upon the instant.\n\n\"I do so wish you COULD, Condy!\" she exclaimed.  \"You are too good for\na Sunday supplement. I know it and YOU know it, and I've heard ever so\nmany people who have read your stories say the same thing.  You could\nspend twenty years working as you are now, and at the end what would\nyou be? Just an assistant editor of a Sunday supplement, and still in\nthe same place; and worse, you'd come to be contented with that, and\nthink you were only good for that and nothing better.  You've got it in\nyou, Condy, to be a great story-teller.  I believe in you, and I've\nevery confidence in you.  But just so long as you stay here and are\nwilling to do hack work, just so long you will be a hack writer.  You\nmust break from it; you MUST get away.  I know you have a good time\nhere; but there are so many things better than that and more worth\nwhile.  You ought to make up your mind to get East, and work for that\nand nothing else.  I know you want to go, but wanting isn't enough.\nEnthusiasm without energy isn't enough.  You have enthusiasm, Condy;\nbut you MUST have energy.  You must be willing to give up things; you\nmust make up your mind that you will go East, and then set your teeth\ntogether and do it.  Oh, I LOVE a man that can do that--make up his\nmind to a thing and then put it through!\"\n\nCondy watched her as she talked, her brown-black eyes coruscating, her\ncheeks glowing, her small hands curled into round pink fists.\n\n\"Blix, you're splendid!\" he exclaimed; \"you're fine! You could put life\ninto a dead man.  You're the kind of girl that are the making of men.\nBy Jove, you'd back a man up, wouldn't you? You'd stand by him till the\nlast ditch.  Of course,\" he went on after a pause--\"of course I ought\nto go to New York.  But, Blix, suppose I went--well, then what? It\nisn't as though I had any income of my own, or rich aunt.  Suppose I\ndidn't find something to do--and the chances are that I wouldn't for\nthree or four months--what would I live on in the meanwhile? 'What\nwould the robin do then, poor thing?' I'm a poor young man, Miss\nBessemer, and I've got to eat.  No; my only chance is 'to be\ndiscovered' by a magazine or a publishing house or somebody, and get a\nbid of some kind.\"\n\n\"Well, there is the Centennial Company.  They have taken an interest in\nyou, Condy.  You must follow that right up and keep your name before\nthem all the time.  Have you sent them 'A Victory Over Death' yet?\"\n\nCondy sat down to his eggs and coffee the next morning in the hotel,\nharried with a certain sense of depression and disappointment for which\nhe could assign no cause.  Nothing seemed to interest him.  The\nnewspaper was dull.  He could look forward to no pleasure in his day's\nwork; and what was the matter with the sun that morning? As he walked\ndown to the office he noted no cloud in the sky, but the brightness was\ngone from the day.  He sat down to his desk and attacked his work, but\n\"copy\" would not come.  The sporting editor and his inane jokes\nharassed him beyond expression.  Just the sight of the clipping\neditor's back was an irritation.  The office boy was a mere incentive\nto profanity.  There was no spring in Condy that morning, no\nelasticity, none of his natural buoyancy.  As the day wore on, his\nennui increased; his luncheon at the club was tasteless, tobacco had\nlost its charm.  He ordered a cocktail in the wine-room, and put it\naside with a wry face.\n\nThe afternoon was one long tedium.  At every hour he flung his pencil\ndown, utterly unable to formulate the next sentence of his article,\nand, his hands in his pockets, gazed gloomily out of the window over\nthe wilderness of roofs--grimy, dirty, ugly roofs that spread out\nbelow.  He craved diversion, amusement, excitement.  Something there\nwas that he wanted with all his heart and soul; yet he was quite unable\nto say what it was.  Something was gone from him to-day that he had\npossessed yesterday, and he knew he would not regain it on the morrow,\nnor the next day, nor the day after that.  What was it? He could not\nsay.  For half an hour he imagined he was going to be sick.  His mother\nwas not to be at home that evening, and Condy dined at his club in the\nhopes of finding some one with whom he could go to the theatre later on\nin the evening.  Sargeant joined him over his coffee and cigarette, but\ndeclined to go with him to the theatre.\n\n\"Another game on to-night?\" asked Condy.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" admitted the other.\n\n\"I guess I'll join you to-night,\" said Condy. \"I've had the blue devils\nsince morning, and I've got to have something to drive them off.\"\n\n\"Don't let me urge you, you know,\" returned Sargeant.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right!\" Condy assured him.  \"My time's about up,\nanyways.\"\n\nAn hour later, just as he, Sargeant, and the other men of their \"set\"\nwere in the act of going upstairs to the card-rooms, a hall-boy gave\nCondy a note, at that moment brought by a messenger, who was waiting\nfor an answer.  It was from Blix.  She wrote:\n\n\n\"Don't you want to come up and play cards with me to-night? We haven't\nhad a game in over a week?\"\n\n\n\"How did she know?\" thought Condy to himself--\"how could she tell?\"\nAloud, he said:\n\n\"I can't join you fellows, after all.  'Despatch from the managing\neditor.' Some special detail or other.\"\n\nFor the first time since the previous evening Condy felt his spirits\nrise as he set off toward the Washington Street hill.  But though he\nand Blix spent as merry an evening as they remembered in a long time,\nhis nameless, formless irritation returned upon him almost as soon as\nhe had bidden her good-night.  It stayed with him all through the week,\nand told upon his work.  As a result, three of his articles were thrown\nout by the editor.\n\n\"We can't run such rot as that in the paper,\" the chief had said.\n\"Can't you give us a story?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've got a kind of a yarn you can run if you like,\" answered\nCondy, his week's depression at its very lowest.\n\n\"A Victory Over Death\" was published in the following Sunday's\nsupplement of the \"Times,\" with illustrations by one of the staff\nartists.  It attracted not the least attention.\n\nJust before he went to bed the Sunday evening of its appearance, Condy\nread it over again for the last time.\n\n\"It's a rotten failure,\" he muttered gloomily as he cast the paper from\nhim.  \"Simple drivel.  I wonder what Blix will think of it.  I wonder\nif I amount to a hill of beans.  I wonder WHAT she wants to go East\nfor, anyway.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nThe old-fashioned Union Street cable car, with its low, comfortable\noutside seats, put Blix and Condy down just inside the Presidio\nGovernment Reservation.  Condy asked a direction of a sentry nursing\nhis Krag-Jorgensen at the terminus of the track, and then with Blix set\noff down the long board walk through the tunnel of overhanging\nevergreens.\n\nThe day could not have been more desirable.  It was a little after ten\nof a Monday morning, Condy's weekly holiday.  The air was neither cool\nnor warm, effervescent merely, brisk and full of the smell of grass and\nof the sea.  The sky was a speckless sheen of pale blue.  To their\nright, and not far off, was the bay, blue as indigo.  Alcatraz seemed\nclose at hand; beyond was the enormous green, red, and purple pyramid\nof Tamalpais climbing out of the water, head and shoulders above the\nlittle foothills, and looking out to the sea and to the west.\n\nThe Reservation itself was delightful.  There were rows of the\nofficers' houses, all alike, drawn up in lines like an assembly of the\nstaff; there were huge barracks, most like college dormitories; and on\ntheir porches enlisted men in shirt sleeves and overalls were cleaning\nsaddles, and polishing the brass of head-stalls and bridles, whistling\nthe while or smoking corn-cob pipes.  Here on the parade-ground a\nsoldier, his coat and vest removed, was batting grounders and flies to\na half-dozen of his fellows.  Over by the stables, strings of horses,\nall of the same color, were being curried and cleaned.  A young\nlieutenant upon a bicycle spun silently past.  An officer came from his\nfront gate, his coat unbuttoned and a briar in his teeth.  The walks\nand roads were flanked with lines of black-painted cannon-balls;\ninverted pieces of abandoned ordnance stood at corners.  From a\ndistance came the mellow snarling of a bugle.\n\nBlix and Condy had planned a long walk for that day.  They were to go\nout through the Presidio Reservation, past the barracks and officers'\nquarters, and on to the old fort at the Golden Gate.  Here they would\nturn and follow the shore-line for a way, then strike inland across the\nhills for a short half-mile, and regain the city and the street-car\nlines by way of the golf-links.  Condy had insisted upon wearing his\nbicycle outfit for the occasion, and, moreover, carried a little\nsatchel, which, he said, contained a pair of shoes.\n\nBut Blix was as sweet as a rose that morning, all in tailor-made black\nbut for the inevitable bands of white satin wrapped high and tight\nabout her neck.  The St. Bernard dog-collar did duty as a belt.  She\nhad disdained a veil, and her yellow hair was already blowing about her\nsmooth pink cheeks.  She walked at his side, her step as firm and solid\nas his own, her round, strong arms swinging, her little brown eyes\nshining with good spirits and vigor, and the pure, clean animal joy of\nbeing alive on that fine cool Western morning.  She talked almost\nincessantly.  She was positively garrulous.  She talked about the fine\nday that it was, about the queer new forage caps of the soldiers, about\nthe bare green hills of the Reservation, about the little cemetery they\npassed just beyond the limits of the barracks, about a rabbit she saw,\nand about the quail they both heard whistling and calling in the\nhollows under the bushes.\n\nCondy walked at her side in silence, yet no less happy than she,\nsmoking his pipe and casting occasional glances at a great ship--a\nfour-master that was being towed out toward the Golden Gate.  At every\nmoment and at every turn they noted things that interested them, and to\nwhich they called each other's attention.\n\n\"Look, Blix!\"\n\n\"Oh, Condy, look at that!\"\n\nThey were soon out of the miniature city of the Post, and held on down\nthrough the low reach of tules and sand-dunes that stretch between the\nbarracks and the old red fort.\n\n\"Look, Condy!\" said Blix.  \"What's that building down there on the\nshore of the bay--the one with the flagstaff?\"\n\n\"I think that must be the lifeboat station.\"\n\n\"I wonder if we could go down and visit it.  I think it would be good\nfun.\"\n\n\"Idea!\" exclaimed Condy.\n\nThe station was close at hand.  To reach it they had but to leave the\ncrazy board walk that led on toward the fort, and cross a few hundred\nyards of sand-dune.  Condy opened the gate that broke the line of\nevergreen hedge around the little two-story house, and promptly\nunchained a veritable pandemonium of dogs.\n\nInside, the place was not without a certain charm of its own.  A brick\nwall, bordered with shells, led to the front of the station, which gave\ndirectly upon the bay; a little well-kept lawn opened to right and\nleft, and six or eight gaily-painted old rowboats were set about, half\nfilled with loam in which fuchsias, geraniums, and mignonettes were\nflowering.  A cat or two dozed upon the window-sills in the sun.  Upon\na sort of porch overhead, two of the crew paced up and down in a manner\nthat at once suggested the poop.  Here and there was a gleam of highly\npolished red copper or brass trimmings.  The bay was within two steps\nof the front door, while a little further down the beach was the house\nwhere the surf-boat was kept, and the long runway leading down from it\nto the water.  Condy rapped loudly at the front door.  It was opened by\nCaptain Jack.\n\nCaptain Jack, and no other; only now he wore a blue sweater and a\nleather-visored cap, with the letters U. S. L. B. S. around the band.\n\nNot an instant was given them for preparation.  The thing had happened\nwith the abruptness of a transformation scene at a theatre.  Condy's\nknock had evoked a situation.  Speech was stricken from their mouths.\nFor a moment they were bereft even of action, and stood there on the\nthreshold, staring open-mouthed and open-eyed at the sudden\nreappearance of their \"matrimonial object.\" Condy was literally dumb;\nin the end it was Blix who tided them over the crisis.\n\n\"We were just going by--just taking a walk,\" she explained, \"and we\nthought we'd like to see the station.  Is it all right? Can we look\naround?\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" assented the Captain with great cordiality.  \"Come\nright in.  This is visitors' day.  You just happened to hit it--only\nit's mighty few visitors we ever have,\" he added.\n\nWhile Condy was registering for himself and Blix, they managed to\nexchange a lightning glance.  It was evident the Captain did not\nrecognize them.  The situation readjusted itself, even promised to be\nof extraordinary interest.  And for that matter it made little\ndifference whether the captain remembered them or not.\n\n\"No, we don't get many visitors,\" the Captain went on, as he led them\nout of the station and down the small gravel walk to the house where\nthe surf-boat was kept.  \"This is a quiet station.  People don't fetch\nout this way very often, and we're not called out very often, either.\nWe're an inside post, you see, and usually we don't get a call unless\nthe sea's so high that the Cliff House station can't launch their boat.\nSo, you see, we don't go out much, but when we DO, it means business\nwith a great big B.  Now, this here, you see,\" continued the Captain,\nrolling back the sliding doors of the house, \"is the surf-boat.  By the\nway, let's see; I ain't just caught your names yet.\"\n\n\"Well, my name's Rivers,\" said Condy, \"and this is Miss Bessemer.\nWe're both from the city.\"\n\n\"Happy to know you, sir; happy to know you, miss,\" he returned, pulling\noff his cap.  \"My name's Hoskins, but you can just call me Captain\nJack.  I'm so used to it that I don't kind of answer to the other.\nWell, now, Miss Bessemer, this here's the surf-boat; she's\nself-rightin', self-bailin', she can't capsize, and if I was to tell\nyou how many thousands of dollars she cost, you wouldn't believe me.\"\n\nCondy and Blix spent a delightful half-hour in the boat-house while\nCaptain Jack explained and illustrated, and told them anecdotes of\nwrecks, escapes, and rescues till they held their breaths like\nten-year-olds.\n\nIt did not take Condy long to know that he had discovered what the\nstory-teller so often tells of but so seldom finds, and what, for want\nof a better name, he elects to call \"a character.\"\n\nCaptain Jack had been everywhere, had seen everything, and had done\nmost of the things worth doing, including a great many things that he\nhad far better have left undone.  But on this latter point the Captain\nseemed to be innocently and completely devoid of a moral sense of right\nand wrong.  It was quite evident that he saw no matter for conscience\nin the smuggling of Chinamen across the Canadian border at thirty\ndollars a head--a venture in which he had had the assistance of the\nprodigal son of an American divine of international renown.  The trade\nto Peruvian insurgents of condemned rifles was to be regretted only\nbecause the ring manipulating it was broken up.  The appropriation of a\nschooner in the harbor of Callao was a story in itself; while the\nrobbery of thirty thousand dollars' worth of sea-otter skins from a\nRussian trading-post in Alaska, accomplished chiefly through the agency\nof a barrel of rum manufactured from sugar-cane, was a veritable\nachievement.\n\nHe had been born, so he told them, in Winchester, in England, and--\nHeaven save the mark!--had been brought up with a view of taking\norders.  For some time he was a choir boy in the great Winchester\nCathedral; then, while yet a lad, had gone to sea.  He had been\nboat-steerer on a New Bedford whaler, and struck his first whale when\nonly sixteen.  He had filibustered down to Chili; had acted as ice\npilot on an Arctic relief expedition; had captained a crew of Chinamen\nshark-fishing in Magdalena Bay, and had been nearly murdered by his\nmen; had been a deep-sea diver, and had burst his ear-drums at the\nbusiness, so that now he could blow tobacco smoke out of his ears; he\nhad been shipwrecked in the Gilberts, fought with the Seris on the\nlower California Islands, sold champagne--made from rock candy,\neffervescent salts, and Reisling wine--to the Coreans, had dreamed of\n\"holding up\" a Cunard liner, and had ridden on the Strand in a hansom\nwith William Ewart Gladstone.  But the one thing of which he was proud,\nthe one picture of his life he most delighted to recall, was himself as\nmanager of a negro minstrel troupe, in a hired drum-major's uniform,\nmarching down the streets of Sacramento at the head of the brass band\nin burnt cork and regimentals.\n\n\"The star of the troupe,\" he told them, \"was the lady with the iron\njore.  We busted in Stockton, and she gave me her diamonds to pawn.  I\npawned 'em, and kept back something in the hand for myself and hooked\nit to San Francisco.  Strike me straight if she didn't follow me, that\niron-jored piece; met me one day in front of the Bush Street Theatre,\nand horsewhipped me properly.  Now, just think of that\"--and he laughed\nas though it was the best kind of a joke.\n\n\"But,\" hazarded Blix, \"don't you find it rather dull out here--\nlonesome? I should think you would want to have some one with you to\nkeep you company--to--to do your cooking for you?\"\n\nBut Condy, ignoring her diplomacy and thinking only of possible\nstories, blundered off upon another track.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"you've led such a life of action, I should think this\nstation would be pretty dull for you.  How did you happen to choose it?\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" answered the Captain, leaning against the smooth white\nflank of the surf-boat, his hands in his pockets, \"I'm lying low just\nnow.  I got into a scrape down at Libertad, in Mexico, that made talk,\nand I'm waiting for that to die down some.  You see, it was this way.\"\n\nMindful of their experience with the mate of the whaleback, Condy and\nBlix were all attention in an instant.  Blix sat down upon an upturned\nbox, her elbows on her knees, leaning forward, her little eyes fixed\nand shining with interest and expectation; Condy, the story-teller all\nalive and vibrant in him, stood at her elbow, smoking cigarette after\ncigarette, his fingers dancing with excitement and animation as the\nCaptain spoke.\n\nAnd then it was that Condy and Blix, in that isolated station, the bay\nlapping at the shore within ear-shot, in that atmosphere redolent of\npaint and oakum and of seaweed decaying upon the beach outside, first\nheard the story of \"In Defiance of Authority.\"\n\nCaptain Jack began it with his experience as a restaurant keeper during\nthe boom days in Seattle, Washington.  He told them how he was the\ncashier of a dining-saloon whose daily net profits exceeded eight\nhundred dollars; how its proprietor suddenly died, and how he, Captain\nJack, continued the management of the restaurant pending a settlement\nof the proprietor's affairs and an appearance of heirs; how in the\nconfusion and excitement of the boom no settlement was ever made; and\nhow, no heirs appearing, he assumed charge of the establishment\nhimself, paying bills, making contracts, and signing notes, until he\ncame to consider the business and all its enormous profits as his own;\nand how at last, when the restaurant was burned, he found himself some\nforty thousand dollars \"ahead of the game.\"\n\nThen he told them of the strange club of the place, called \"The\nExiles,\" made up chiefly of \"younger sons\" of English and\nBritish-Canadian families, every member possessed of a \"past\" more or\nless disreputable; men who had left their country for their country's\ngood, and for their family's peace of mind--adventurers, wanderers,\nsoldiers of fortune, gentlemen-vagabonds, men of hyphenated names and\neven noble birth, whose appellations were avowedly aliases.  He told\nthem of his meeting with Billy Isham, one of the club's directors, and\nof the happy-go-lucky, reckless, unpractical character of the man; of\ntheir acquaintance, intimacy, and subsequent partnership; of how the\nfilibustering project was started with Captain Jack's forty thousand,\nand the never-to-be-forgotten interview in San Francisco with Senora\nEstrada, the agent of the insurgents; of the incident of her\ncalling-card--how she tore it in two and gave one-half to Isham; of\ntheir outfitting, and the broken sextant that was to cause their\nultimate discomfiture and disaster, and of the voyage to the rendezvous\non a Panama liner.\n\n\"Strike me!\" continued Captain Jack, \"you should have seen Billy Isham\non that Panama dough-dish; a passenger ship she was, and Billy was the\nlife of her from stem to stern-post.  There was a church pulpit aboard\nthat they were taking down to Mazatlan for some chapel or other, and\nthis here pulpit was lashed on deck aft.  Well, Billy had been most\nkinds of a fool in his life, and among others a play-actor; called\nhimself Gaston Maundeville, and was clean daft on his knowledge of\nShakespeare and his own power of interpretin' the hidden meanin' of the\nlines.  I ain't never going to forgit the day he gave us Portia's\nspeech.  We were just under the tropic, and the day was a scorcher.\nThere was mostly men folk aboard, and we lay around the deck in our\npajamas, while Billy--Gaston Maundeville, dressed in striped red and\nwhite pajamas--clum up in that bally pulpit, with the ship's\nShakespeare in his hands, an' let us have--'The quality o' mercy isn't\nstrained; it droppeth as the genteel dew from heavun.' Laugh, I tell\nyou I was sore with it.  Lord, how we guyed him! An' the more we guyed\nand the more we laughed, the more serious he got and the madder he\ngrew.  He said he was interpretin' the hidden meanin' of the lines.\"\n\nAnd so the Captain ran through that wild, fiery tale--of fighting and\nloving, buccaneering and conspiring; mandolins tinkling, knives\nclicking; oaths mingling with sonnets, and spilled wine with spilled\nblood.  He told them of Isham's knife duel with the Mexican lieutenant,\ntheir left wrists lashed together; of the \"battle of the thirty\" in the\npitch dark of the Custom House cellar; of Senora Estrada's love for\nIsham; and all the roll and plunge of action that make up the story of\n\"In Defiance of Authority.\"\n\nAt the end, Blix's little eyes were snapping like sparks; Condy's face\nwas flaming, his hands were cold, and he was shifting his weight from\nfoot to foot, like an excited thoroughbred horse.\n\n\"Heavens and earth, what a yarn!\" he exclaimed almost in a whisper.\n\nBlix drew a long, tremulous breath and sat back upon the upturned box,\nlooking around her as though she had but that moment been awakened.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the Captain, rolling a cigarette.  \"Yes, sir, those\nwere great days.  Get down there around the line in those little,\nout-o'-the-way republics along the South American coast, and things\nhappen to you.  You hold a man's life in the crook of your forefinger,\nan' nothing's done by halves.  If you hate a man, you lay awake nights\nbiting your mattress, just thinking how you hate him; an' if you love a\nwoman--good Lord, how you do LOVE her!\"\n\n\"But--but!\" exclaimed Condy, \"I don't see how you can want to do\nanything else.  Why, you're living sixty to the minute when you're\nplaying a game like that!\"\n\n\"Oh, I ain't dead yet!\" answered the Captain.  \"I got a few schemes\nleft that I could get fun out of.\"\n\n\"How can you wait a minute!\" exclaimed Blix breathlessly.  \"Why don't\nyou get a ship right away--to-morrow--and go right off on some other\nadventure?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't just now,\" returned the Captain, blowing the smoke from\nhis cigarette through his ears.  \"There's a good many reasons; one of\n'em is that I've just been married.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nMum--mar--married! gasped Condy, swallowing something in his throat.\n\nBlix rose to her feet.\n\n\"Just been MARRIED!\" she repeated, a little frightened.\n\"Why--why--why; how DELIGHTFUL!\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" mumbled Condy.  \"How delightful.  I congratulate you!\"\n\n\"Come in--come back to the station,\" said the Captain jovially, \"and\nI'll introduce you to m' wife.  We were married only last Sunday.\"\n\n\"Why, yes--yes, of course, we'd be delighted,\" vociferated the two\nconspirators a little hysterically.\n\n\"She's a mighty fine little woman,\" declared the Captain, as he rolled\nthe door of the boat-house to its place and preceded them up the gravel\nwalk to the station.\n\n\"Of course she is,\" responded Blix.  Behind Captain Jack's back she\nfixed Condy with a wide-eyed look, and nudged him fiercely with an\nelbow to recall him to himself; for Condy's wits were scattered like a\nflock of terrified birds, and he was gazing blankly at the Captain's\ncoat collar with a vacant, maniacal smile.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, Condy!\" she had time to whisper before they arrived\nin the hallway of the station.\n\nBut fortunately they were allowed a minute or so to recover themselves\nand prepare for what was coming.  Captain Jack ushered them into what\nwas either the parlor, office, or sitting-room of the station, and left\nthem with the words:\n\n\"Just make yourselves comfortable here, an' I'll go fetch the little\nwoman.\"\n\nNo sooner had he gone than the two turned to each other.\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"WELL!\"\n\n\"We're in for it now.\"\n\n\"But we must see it through, Condy; act just as natural as you can, and\nwe're all right.\"\n\n\"But supposing SHE recognizes us!\"\n\n\"Supposing she does--what then.  How ARE they to know that we wrote the\nletters?\"\n\n\"Sh, Blix, not so loud! They know by now that THEY didn't.\"\n\n\"But it seems that it hasn't made any difference to them; they are\nmarried.  And besides, they wouldn't speak about putting 'personals' in\nthe paper to us.  They would never let anybody know that.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose they could possibly suspect?\"\n\n\"I'm sure they couldn't.\"\n\n\"Here they come.\"\n\n\"Keep perfectly calm, and we're saved.\"\n\n\"Suppose it isn't K. D. B., after all?\"\n\nBut it was, of course, and she recognized them in an instant.  She and\nthe Captain--the latter all grins--came in from the direction of the\nkitchen, K. D. B. wearing a neat blue calico gown and an apron that was\nreally a marvel of cleanliness and starch.\n\n\"Kitty!\" exclaimed Captain Jack, seized again with an unexplainable\nmirth, \"here's some young folks come out to see the place an' I want\nyou to know 'em.  Mr. Rivers, this is m' wife, Kitty, and--lessee,\nmiss, I don't rightly remember your name.\"\n\n\"Bessemer!\" exclaimed Condy and Blix in a breath.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed K. D. B., \"you were in the restaurant the night that\nthe Captain and I--I--that is--yes, I'm quite sure I've seen you\nbefore.\" She turned from one to the other, beginning to blush furiously.\n\n\"Yes, yes, in Luna's restaurant, wasn't it?\" said Condy desperately.\n\"It seems to me I do just barely remember.\"\n\n\"And wasn't the Captain there?\" Blix ventured.\n\n\"I forgot my stick, I remember,\" continued Condy.  \"I came back for it;\nand just as I was going out it seems to me I saw you two at a table\nnear the door.\"\n\nHe thought it best to allow their \"matrimonial objects\" to believe he\nhad not seen them before.\n\n\"Yes, yes, we were there,\" answered K. D. B. tactfully.  \"We dine there\nalmost every Monday night.\"\n\nBlix guessed that K. D. B. would prefer to have the real facts of the\nsituation ignored, and determined she should have the chance to change\nthe conversation if she wished.\n\n\"What a delicious supper one has there!\" she said.\n\n\"Can't say I like Mexican cooking myself,\" answered K. D. B.,\nforgetting that they dined there every Monday night.  \"Plain United\nStates is good enough for me.\"\n\nSuddenly Captain Jack turned abruptly to Condy, exclaiming: \"Oh, you\nwas the chap that called the picture of that schooner a barkentine.\"\n\n\"Yes; WASN'T that a barkentine?\" he answered innocently.\n\n\"Barkentine your EYE!\" spluttered the Captain.  \"Why, that was a\nschooner as plain as a pie plate.\"\n\nBut ten minutes later the ordeal was over, and Blix and Condy, once\nmore breathing easily, were on their walk again.  The Captain and K. D.\nB. had even accompanied them to the gate of the station, and had\nstrenuously urged them to \"come in and see them again the next time\nthey were out that way.\"\n\n\"Married!\" murmured Condy, putting both hands to his head.  \"We've done\nit, we've done it now.\"\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" declared Blix, a little defiantly.  \"I think it's\nall right.  You can see the Captain is in love with her, and she with\nhim.  No, we've nothing to reproach ourselves with.\"\n\n\"But--but--but so sudden!\" whispered Condy, all aghast.  \"That's what\nmakes me faint--the suddenness of it.\"\n\n\"It shows how much they are in love, how--how readily they--adapted\nthemselves to each other.  No, it's all right.\"\n\n\"They seemed to like us--actually.\"\n\n\"Well, they had better--if they knew the truth.  Without us they never\nwould have met.\"\n\n\"They both asked us to come out and see them again, did you notice\nthat? Let's do it, Blix,\" Condy suddenly exclaimed; \"let's get to know\nthem!\"\n\n\"Of course we must.  Wouldn't it be fun to call on them--to get\nregularly acquainted with them!\"\n\n\"They might ask us to dinner some time.\"\n\n\"And think of the stories he could tell you!\"\n\nThey enthused immediately upon this subject, both talking excitedly at\nthe same time, going over the details of the Captain's yarns, recalling\nthe incidents to each other.\n\n\"Fancy!\" exclaimed Condy--\"fancy Billy Isham in his pajamas, red and\nwhite stripes, reading Shakespeare from that pulpit on board the ship,\nand the other men guying him! Isn't that a SCENE for you? Can't you\njust SEE it?\n\n\"I wonder if the Captain wasn't making all those things up as he went\nalong.  He don't seem to have any sense of right and wrong at all.  He\nmight have been lying, Condy.\"\n\n\"What difference would that make?\"\n\nAnd so they went along in that fine, clear, Western morning, on the\nedge of the Continent, both of them young and strong and vigorous, the\nPacific under their eyes, the great clean Trades blowing in their\nfaces, the smell of the salt sea coming in long aromatic whiffs to\ntheir nostrils.  Young and strong and fresh, their imaginations\nthronging with pictures of vigorous action and adventure, buccaneering,\nfilibustering, and all the swing, the leap, the rush and gallop, the\nexuberant, strong life of the great, uncharted world of Romance.\n\nAnd all unknowingly they were a Romance in themselves.  Cynicism, old\nage, and the weariness of all things done had no place in the world in\nwhich they walked.  They still had their illusions, all the keenness of\ntheir sensations, all the vividness of their impressions.  The simple\nthings of the world, the great, broad, primal emotions of the race\nstirred in them.  As they swung along, going toward the ocean, their\nbrains were almost as empty of thought or of reflection as those of two\nfine, clean animals.  They were all for the immediate sensation; they\ndid not think--they FELT.  The intellect was dormant; they looked at\nthings, they heard things, they smelled the smell of the sea, and of\nthe seaweed, of the fat, rank growth of cresses in the salt marshes;\nthey turned their cheeks to the passing wind, and filled their mouths\nand breasts with it.  Their life was sweet to them; every hour was one\nglad effervescence.  The fact that the ocean was blue was a matter for\nrejoicing.  It was good to be alive on that royal morning.  Just to be\nyoung was an exhilaration; and everything was young with them--the day\nwas young, the country was young, and the civilization to which they\nbelonged, teeming there upon the green, Western fringe of the\ncontinent, was young and heady and tumultuous with the boisterous, red\nblood of a new race.\n\nCondy even forgot, or rather disdained on such a morning as that, to\npiece together and rearrange Captain Jack's yarns into story form.  To\nlook at the sea and the green hills, to watch the pink on Blix's cheek\nand her yellow hair blowing across her eyes and lips, was better than\nthinking.  Life was better than literature.  To live was better than to\nread; one live human being was better than ten thousand Shakespeares;\nan act was better than a thought.  Why, just to love Blix, to be with\nher, to see the sweet, clean flush of her cheek, to know that she was\nthere at his side, and to have the touch of her elbow as they walked,\nwas better than the best story, the greatest novel he could ever hope\nto write.  Life was better than literature, and love was the best thing\nin life.  To love Blix and to be near her--what else was worth while?\nCould he ever think of finding anything in life sweeter and finer than\nthis dear young girl of nineteen?\n\nSuddenly Condy came to himself with an abrupt start.  What was this he\nwas thinking--what was this he was telling himself? Love Blix! He loved\nBlix! Why, of COURSE he loved her--loved her so, that with the thought\nof it there came a great, sudden clutch at the heart and a strange\nsense of tenderness, so vague and yet so great that it eluded speech\nand all expression.  Love her! Of course he loved her! He had, all\nunknowing, loved her even before this wonderful morning: had loved her\nthat day at the lake, and that never-to-be-forgotten, delicious\nafternoon in the Chinese restaurant; all those long, quiet evenings\nspent in the window of the little dining-room, looking down upon the\ndarkening city, he had loved her.  Why, all his days for the last few\nmonths had been full of the love of her.\n\nHow else had he been so happy? how else did it come about that little\nby little he was withdrawing from the society and influence of his\nartificial world, as represented by such men as Sargeant?  how else was\nhe slowly loosening the grip of the one evil and vicious habit that had\nclutched him so long? how else was his ambition stirring? how else was\nhis hitherto aimless enthusiasm hardening to energy and determination?\nShe had not always so influenced him.  In the days when they had just\nknown each other, and met each other in the weekly course of their\nformal life, it had not been so, even though they pretended a certain\namount of affection.  He remembered the evening when Blix had brought\nthose days to an abrupt end, and how at the moment he had told himself\nthat after all he had never known the real Blix.  Since then, in the\ncharming, unconventional life they had led, everything had been\nchanged.  He had come to know her for what she was, to know her genuine\ngoodness, her sincerity, her contempt of affectations, her comradeship,\nher calm, fine strength and unbroken good nature; and day by day, here\na little and there a little, his love for her had grown so quietly, so\nevenly, that he had never known it, until now, behold! it was suddenly\ncome to flower, full and strong--a flower whose fragrance had suddenly\nfilled all his life and all his world with its sweetness.\n\nHalf an hour after leaving the lifeboat station, Condy and Blix reached\nthe old, red-brick fort, deserted, abandoned, and rime-incrusted, at\nthe entrance of the Golden Gate.  They turned its angle, and there\nrolled the Pacific, a blue floor of shifting water, stretching out\nthere forever and forever over the curve of the earth, over the\nshoulder of the world, with never a sail in view and never a break from\nhorizon to horizon.\n\nThey followed down the shore, sometimes upon the old and broken flume\nthat runs along the seaward face of the hills that rise from the beach,\nor sometimes upon the beach itself, stepping from bowlder to bowlder,\nor holding along at the edge of the water upon reaches of white, hard\nsand.\n\nThe beach was solitary; not a soul was in sight.  Close at hand, to\nlandward, great hills, bare and green, shut off the sky; and here and\nthere the land came tumbling down into the sea in great, jagged, craggy\nrocks, knee-deep in swirling foam, and all black with wet.  The air was\nfull of the prolonged thunder of the surf, and at intervals sea-birds\npassed overhead with an occasional piping cry.  Wreckage was tumbled\nabout here and there; and innumerable cocoanut shards, huge, brown cups\nof fuzzy bark, lay underfoot and in the crevices of the rocks.  They\nfound a jellyfish--a pulpy translucent mass; and once even caught a\nsight of a seal in the hollow of a breaker, with sleek and shining\nhead, his barbels bristling, and heard his hoarse croaking bark as he\nhunted the off-shore fish.\n\nBlix refused to allow Condy to help her in the least.  She was quite as\nactive and strong as he, and clambered from rock to rock and over the\nshattered scantling of the flume with the vigor and agility of a young\nboy.  She muddied her shoes to the very tops scratched her hands, tore\nher skirt, and even twisted her ankle; but her little eyes were never\nso bright, nor was the pink flush of her cheeks ever more adorable.\nAnd she was never done talking--a veritable chatterbox.  She saw\neverything and talked about everything she saw, quite indifferent as to\nwhether or no Condy listened.  Now it was a queer bit of seaweed, now\nit was a group of gulls clamoring over a dead fish, now a purple\nstarfish, now a breaker of unusual size.  Her splendid vitality carried\nher away.  She was excited, alive to her very finger-tips, vibrant to\nthe least sensation, quivering to the least impression.\n\n\"Let's get up here and sit down somewhere,\" said Condy, at length.\n\nThey left the beach and climbed up the slope of the hills, near a point\nwhere a long arm of land thrust out into the sea and shut off the wind;\na path was there, and they followed it for a few yards, till they had\ncome to a little amphitheatre surrounded with blackberry bushes.\n\nHere they sat down, Blix settling herself on an old log with a little\nsigh of contentment, Condy stretching himself out, a new-lighted pipe\nin his teeth, his head resting on the little handbag he had\npersistently carried ever since morning.  Then Blix fell suddenly\nsilent, and for a long time the two sat there without speaking,\nabsorbed in the enjoyment of looking at the enormous green hills\nrolling down to the sea, the breakers thundering at the beach, the\ngashed pinnacles of rock, the vast reach of the Pacific, and the\ndistant prospect of the old fort at the entrance of the Golden Gate.\n\n\"We might be a thousand miles away from the city, for all the looks of\nit, mightn't we, Condy?\" said Blix, after a while.  \"And I'm that\nHUNGRY! It must be nearly noon.\"\n\nFor answer, Condy sat up with profound gravity, and with a great air of\nnonchalance opened the handbag, and, instead of shoes took out, first,\na pint bottle of claret, then \"devilish\" ham sandwiches in oiled paper,\na bottle of stuffed olives, a great bag of salted almonds, two little\ntumblers, a paper-covered novel, and a mouth organ.\n\nBlix fairly crowed with delight, clasping her hands upon her knees, and\nrocking to and fro where she sat upon the log.\n\n\"Oh, Condy, and you thought of a LUNCH--you said it was shoes--and you\nremembered I loved stuffed olives, too; and a book to read.  What is\nit--'The Seven Seas.' No, I never WAS so happy.  But the mouth\norgan--what's that for?\"\n\n\"To play on.  What did you think--think it was a can-opener?\"\n\nBlix choked with merriment over his foolery, and Condy added proudly:\n\n\"Look there! I made those sandwiches!\"\n\nThey looked as though he had--great, fat chunks of bread, the crust\nstill on; the \"devilish\" ham in thick strata between; and, positively,\nhe had BUTTERED the bread.  But it was all one with them; they ate as\nthough at a banquet, and Blix even took off her hat and hung it upon\none of the nearby bushes.  Of course Condy had forgotten a corkscrew.\nHe tried to dig out the cork of the claret bottle with his knife, until\nhe had broken both blades and was about to give up in despair, when\nBlix, at the end of her patience, took the bottle from him and pushed\nin the cork with her finger.\n\n\"Wine, music, literature, and feasting,\" observed Condy.  \"We're\ngetting regularly luxurious, just like Sardine-apalus.\"\n\nBut Condy himself had suddenly entered into an atmosphere of happiness,\nthe like of which he had never known or dreamed of before.  He loved\nBlix--he had just discovered it.  He loved her because she was so\ngenuine, so radiantly fresh and strong; loved her because she liked the\nthings that he liked, because they two looked at the world from\nprecisely the same point of view, hating shams and affectations, happy\nin the things that were simple and honest and natural.  He loved her\nbecause she liked his books, appreciating the things therein that he\nappreciated, liking what he liked, disapproving of what he condemned.\nHe loved her because she was nineteen, and because she was so young and\nunspoiled and was happy just because the ocean was blue and the morning\nfine.  He loved her because she was so pretty, because of the softness\nof her yellow hair, because of her round, white forehead and pink\ncheeks, because of her little, dark-brown eyes, with that look in them\nas if she were just done smiling or just about to smile, one could not\nsay which; loved her because of her good, firm mouth and chin, because\nof her full neck and its high, tight bands of white satin.  And he\nloved her because her arms were strong and round, and because she wore\nthe great dog-collar around her trim, firm-corseted waist, and because\nthere emanated from her with every movement a barely perceptible,\ndelicious, feminine odor, that was in part perfume, but mostly a\nsubtle, vague aroma, charming beyond words, that came from her mouth,\nher hair, her neck, her arms, her whole sweet personality.  And he\nloved her because she was herself, because she was Blix, because of\nthat strange, sweet influence that was disengaged from her in those\nquiet moments when she seemed so close to him, when some unnamed,\nmysterious sixth sense in him stirred and woke and told him of her\ngoodness, of her clean purity and womanliness; and that certain, vague\ntenderness in him went out toward her, a tenderness not for her only,\nbut for all the good things of the world; and he felt his nobler side\nrousing up and the awakening of the desire to be his better self.\n\nCovertly he looked at her, as she sat near him, her yellow hair rolling\nand blowing back from her forehead, her hands clasped over her knee,\nlooking out over the ocean, thoughtful, her eyes wide.\n\nShe had told him she did not love him.  Condy remembered that perfectly\nwell.  She was sincere in the matter; she did not love him.  That\nsubject had been once and for all banished from their intercourse.  And\nit was because of that very reason that their companionship of the last\nthree or four months had been so charming.  She looked upon him merely\nas a chum.  She had not changed in the least from that time until now,\nwhereas he--why, all his world was new for him that morning! Why, he\nloved her so, she had become so dear to him, that the very thought of\nher made his heart swell and leap.\n\nBut he must keep all this to himself.  If he spoke to her, told her of\nhow he loved her, it would spoil and end their companionship upon the\ninstant.  They had both agreed upon that; they had tried the other, and\nit had worked out.  As lovers they had wearied of each other; as chums\nthey had been perfectly congenial, thoroughly and completely happy.\n\nCondy set his teeth.  It was a hard situation.  He must choose between\nbringing an end to this charming comradeship of theirs, or else fight\nback all show of love for her, keep it down and under hand, and that at\na time when every nerve of him quivered like a smitten harp-string.  It\nwas not in him or in his temperament to love her calmly, quietly, or at\na distance; he wanted the touch of her hand, the touch of her cool,\nsmooth cheek, the delicious aroma of her breath in his nostrils her\nlips against his, her hair and all its fragrance in his face.\n\n\"Condy, what's the matter?\" Blix was looking at him with an expression\nof no little concern.  \"What are you frowning so about, and clinching\nyour fists? And you're pale, too.  What's gone wrong?\"\n\nHe shot a glance at her, and bestirred himself sharply.\n\n\"Isn't this a jolly little corner?\" he said.  \"Blix, how long is it\nbefore you go?\"\n\n\"Six weeks from to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And you're going to be gone four years--four years! Maybe you never\nwill come back.  Can't tell what will happen in four years.  Where's\nthe blooming mouth-organ?\"\n\nBut the mouth-organ was full of crumbs.  Condy could not play on it.\nTo all his efforts it responded only by gasps, mournfulest\ndeath-rattles, and lamentable wails.  Condy hurled it into the sea.\n\n\"Well, where's the blooming book, then?\" he demanded.  \"You're sitting\non it, Blix.  Here, read something in it.  Open it anywhere.\"\n\n\"No; you read to me.\"\n\n\"I will not.  Haven't I done enough? Didn't I buy the book and get the\nlunch, and make the sandwiches, and pay the car-fare? I think this\nexpedition will cost me pretty near three dollars before we're through\nwith the day.  No; the least you can do is to read to me.  Here, we'll\nmatch for it.\"\n\nCondy drew a dime from his pocket, and Blix a quarter from her purse.\n\n\"You're matching me,\" she said.\n\nCondy tossed the coin and lost, and Blix said, as he picked up the book:\n\n\"For a man that has such unvarying bad luck as you, gambling is just\nsimple madness.  You and I have never played a game of poker yet that\nI've not won every cent of money you had.\"\n\n\"Yes; and what are you doing with it all?\"\n\n\"Spending it,\" she returned loftily; \"gloves and veils and lace\npins--all kinds of things.\"\n\nBut Condy knew the way she spoke that this was not true.\n\nFor the next hour or so he read to her from \"The Seven Seas,\" while the\nafternoon passed, the wind stirring the chaparral and blackberry bushes\nin the hollows of the huge, bare hills, the surf rolling and grumbling\non the beach below, the sea-birds wheeling overhead.  Blix listened\nintently, but Condy could not have told of what he was reading.  Living\nwas better than reading, life was better than literature, and his\nnew-found love for her was poetry enough for him.  He read so that he\nmight not talk to her or look at her, for it seemed to him at times as\nthough some second self in him would speak and betray him in spite of\nhis best efforts.  Never before in all his life had he been so happy;\nnever before had he been so troubled.  He began to jumble the lines and\nwords as he read, over-running periods, even turning two pages at once.\n\n\"What a splendid line!\" Blix exclaimed.\n\n\"What line--what--what are you talking about? Blix, let's always\nremember to-day.  Let's make a promise, no matter what happens or where\nwe are, let's always write to each other on the anniversary of to-day.\nWhat do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes; I'll promise--and you--\"\n\n\"I'll promise faithfully.  Oh, I'll never forget to-day nor--yes, yes,\nI'll promise--why, to-day--Blix--where's that damn book gone?\"\n\n\"Condy!\"\n\n\"Well, I can't find the book.  You're sitting on it again.  Confound\nthe book, anyway! Let's walk some more.\"\n\n\"We've a long ways to go if we're to get home in time for supper.\nLet's go to Luna's for supper.\"\n\n\"I never saw such a girl as you to think of ways for spending money.\nWhat kind of a purse-proud plutocrat do you think I am?  I've only\nseventy-five cents left.  How much have you got?\"\n\nBlix had fifty-five cents in her purse, and they had a grave council\nover their finances.  They had just enough for car-fare and two\n\"suppers Mexican,\" with ten cents left over.\n\n\"That's for Richard's tip,\" said Blix.\n\n\"That's for my CIGAR,\" he retorted.\n\n\"You made ME give him fifty cents.  You said it was the least I could\noffer him--noblesse oblige.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I COULDN'T offer him a dime, don't you see? I'll tell him\nwe are broke this time.\"\n\nThey started home, not as they had come, but climbing the hill and\ngoing across a breezy open down, radiant with blue iris, wild\nheliotrope, yellow poppies, and even a violet here and there.  A little\nfurther on they gained one of the roads of the Reservation, red earth\nsmooth as a billiard table; and just at an angle where the road made a\nsharp elbow and trended cityward, they paused for a moment and looked\ndown and back at the superb view of the ocean, the vast half-moon of\nland, and the rolling hills in the foreground tumbling down toward the\nbeach and all spangled with wild flowers.\n\nSome fifteen minutes later they reached the golf-links.\n\n\"We can go across the links,\" said Condy, \"and strike any number of car\nlines on the other side.\"\n\nThey left the road and struck across the links, Condy smoking his\nnew-lighted pipe.  But as they came around the edge of a long line of\neucalyptus trees near the teeing ground, a warning voice suddenly\ncalled out:\n\n\"Fore!\"\n\nCondy and Blix looked up sharply, and there in a group not twenty feet\naway, in tweeds and \"knickers,\" in smart, short golfing skirts and\nplaid cloaks, they saw young Sargeant and his sister, two other girls\nwhom they knew as members of the fashionable \"set,\" and Jack Carter in\nthe act of swinging his driving iron.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nAs the clock in the library of the club struck midnight, Condy laid\ndown his pen, shoved the closely written sheets of paper from him, and\nleaned back in his chair, his fingers to his tired eyes.  He was\nsitting at a desk in one of the further corners of the room and shut\noff by a great Japanese screen.  He was in his shirt-sleeves, his hair\nwas tumbled, his fingers ink-stained, and his face a little pale.\n\nSince late in the evening he had been steadily writing.  Three chapters\nof \"In Defiance of Authority\" were done, and he was now at work on the\nfourth.  The day after the excursion to the Presidio--that wonderful\nevent which seemed to Condy to mark the birthday of some new man within\nhim--the idea had suddenly occurred to him that Captain Jack's story of\nthe club of the exiles, the boom restaurant, and the filibustering\nexpedition was precisely the novel of adventure of which the Centennial\nCompany had spoken.  At once he had set to work upon it, with an\nenthusiasm that, with shut teeth, he declared would not be lacking in\nenergy.  The story would have to be written out of his business hours.\nThat meant he would have to give up his evenings to it.  But he had\ndone this, and for nearly a week had settled himself to his task in the\nquiet corner of the club at eight o'clock, and held to it resolutely\nuntil twelve.\n\nThe first two chapters had run off his pen with delightful ease.  The\nthird came harder; the events and incidents of the story became\nconfused and contradictory; the character of Billy Isham obstinately\nrefused to take the prominent place which Condy had designed for him;\nand with the beginning of the fourth chapter, Condy had finally come to\nknow the enormous difficulties, the exasperating complications, the\ndiscouragements that begin anew with every paragraph, the obstacles\nthat refuse to be surmounted, and all the pain, the labor, the\ndownright mental travail and anguish that fall to the lot of the writer\nof novels.\n\nTo write a short story with the end in plain sight from the beginning\nwas an easy matter compared to the upbuilding, grain by grain, atom by\natom, of the fabric of \"In Defiance of Authority.\" Condy soon found\nthat there was but one way to go about the business.  He must shut his\neyes to the end of his novel--that far-off, divine event--and take his\ntask chapter by chapter, even paragraph by paragraph; grinding out the\ntale, as it were, by main strength, driving his pen from line to line,\nhating the effort, happy only with the termination of each chapter, and\nworking away, hour by hour, minute by minute, with the dogged, sullen,\nhammer-and-tongs obstinacy of the galley-slave, scourged to his daily\ntoil.\n\nAt times the tale, apparently out of sheer perversity, would come to a\nfull stop.  To write another word seemed beyond the power of human\ningenuity, and for an hour or more Condy would sit scowling at the\nhalf-written page, gnawing his nails, scouring his hair, dipping his\npen into the ink-well, and squaring himself to the sheet of paper, all\nto no purpose.\n\nThere was no pleasure in it for him.  A character once fixed in his\nmind, a scene once pictured in his imagination, and even before he had\nwritten a word the character lost the charm of its novelty, the scene\nthe freshness of its original conception.  Then, with infinite\npainstaking and with a patience little short of miraculous, he must\nslowly build up, brick by brick, the plan his brain had outlined in a\nsingle instant.  It was all work--hard, disagreeable, laborious work;\nand no juggling with phrases, no false notions as to the \"delight of\ncreation,\" could make it appear otherwise.  \"And for what,\" he muttered\nas he rose, rolled up his sheaf of manuscript, and put on his coat;\n\"what do I do it for, I don't know.\"\n\nIt was beyond question that, had he begun his novel three months before\nthis time, Condy would have long since abandoned the hateful task.  But\nBlix had changed all that.  A sudden male force had begun to develop in\nCondy.  A master-emotion had shaken him, and he had commenced to see\nand to feel the serious, more abiding, and perhaps the sterner side of\nlife.  Blix had steadied him, there was no denying that.  He was not\nquite the same boyish, hairbrained fellow who had made \"a buffoon of\nhimself\" in the Chinese restaurant, three months before.\n\nThe cars had stopped running by the time Condy reached the street.  He\nwalked home and flung himself to bed, his mind tired, his nerves\nunstrung, and all the blood of his body apparently concentrated in his\nbrain.  Working at night after writing all day long was telling upon\nhim, and he knew it.\n\nWhat with his work and his companionship with Blix, Condy soon began to\ndrop out of his wonted place in his \"set.\"  He was obliged to decline\none invitation after another that would take him out in the evening,\nand instead of lunching at his club with Sargeant or George Hands, as\nhe had been accustomed to do at one time, he fell into another habit of\nlunching with Blix at the flat on Washington Street, and spending the\ntwo hours allowed to him in the middle of the day in her company.\n\nCondy's desertion of them was often spoken of by the men of his club\nwith whom he had been at one time so intimate, and the subject happened\nto be brought up again one noon when Jack Carter was in the club as\nGeorge Hands' guest.  Hands, Carter, and Eckert were at one of the\nwindows over their after-dinner cigars and liqueurs.\n\n\"I say,\" said Eckert suddenly, \"who's that girl across the street\nthere--the one in black, just going by that furrier's sign? I've seen\nher somewhere before.  Know who it is?\"\n\n\"That's Miss Bessemer, isn't it?\" said George Hands, leaning forward.\n\"Rather a stunning-looking girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's Travis Bessemer,\" assented Jack Carter; adding, a moment\nlater, \"it's too bad about that girl.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Eckert.\n\nCarter lifted a shoulder.  \"Isn't ANYTHING the matter as far as I know,\nonly somehow the best people have dropped her.  She USED to be received\neverywhere.\"\n\n\"Come to think, I HAVEN'T seen her out much this season,\" said Eckert.\n\"But I heard she had bolted from 'Society' with the big S, and was\ngoing East--going to study medicine, I believe.\"\n\n\"I've always noticed,\" said Carter, with a smile, \"that so soon as a\ngirl is declassee, she develops a purpose in life and gets earnest, and\nall that sort of thing.\n\n\"Oh, well, come,\" growled George Hands, \"Travis Bessemer is not\ndeclassee.\"\n\n\"I didn't say she was,\" answered Carter; \"but she has made herself\ntalked about a good deal lately.  Going around with Rivers, as she\ndoes, isn't the most discreet thing in the world.  Of course, it's all\nright, but it all makes talk, and I came across them by a grove of\ntrees out on the links the other day--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed Sargeant, leaning on the back of Carter's armchair;\n\"yes; and I noticed, too, that she cut you dead.  You fellows should\nhave been there,\" he went on, in perfect good humor, turning to the\nothers.  \"You missed a good little scene.  Rivers and Miss Bessemer had\nbeen taking a tramp over the Reservation--and, by the way, it's a great\nplace to walk, so my sister tells me; she and Dick Forsythe take a\nconstitutional out there every Saturday morning--well, as I was saying,\nRivers and Miss Bessemer came upon our party rather unexpectedly.  We\nwere all togged out in our golfing bags, and I presume we looked more\nlike tailor's models, posing for the gallery, than people who were\ntaking an outing; but Rivers and Miss Bessemer had been regularly\nexercising; looked as though they had done their fifteen miles since\nmorning.  They had their old clothes on, and they were dusty and muddy.\n\n\"You would have thought that a young girl such as Miss Bessemer is--for\nshe's very young--would have been a little embarrassed at running up\nagainst such a spick and span lot as we were.  Not a bit of it; didn't\nlose her poise for a moment.  She bowed to my sister and to me, as\nthough from the top of a drag, by Jove! and as though she were fresh\nfrom Redfern and Virot.  You know a girl that can manage herself that\nway is a thoroughbred.  She even remembered to cut little Johnnie\nCarter here, because Johnnie forced himself upon her one night at a\ndance when he was drunk; didn't she, Johnnie? Johnnie came up to her\nthere, out on the links, fresh as a daisy, and put out his hand, with,\n'Why, how do you do, Miss Bessemer?' and 'wherever did you come from?'\nand 'I haven't seen you in so long'; and she says, 'No, not since our\nlast dance, I believe, Mr. Carter,' and looked at his hand as though it\nwas something funny.\n\n\"Little Johnnie mumbled and flushed and stammered and backed off; and\nit was well that he did, because Rivers had begun to get red around the\nwattles.  I say the little girl is a thoroughbred, and my sister wants\nto give her a dinner as soon as she comes out.  But Johnnie says she's\ndeclassee, so may be my sister had better think it over.\"\n\n\"I didn't say she was declassee,\" exclaimed Carter.  \"I only said she\nwould do well to be more careful.\"\n\nSargeant shifted his cigar to the other corner of his mouth, one eye\nshut to avoid the smoke.\n\n\"One might say as much of lots of people,\" he answered.\n\n\"I don't like your tone!\" Carter flared out.\n\n\"Oh, go to the devil, Johnnie!  Shall we all have a drink?\"\n\nOn the Friday evening of that week, Condy set himself to his work at\nhis accustomed hour.  But he had had a hard day on the \"Times,\"\nSupplement, and his brain, like an overdriven horse, refused to work.\nIn half an hour he had not written a paragraph.\n\n\"I thought it would be better, in the end, to loaf for one evening,\" he\nexplained to Blix, some twenty minutes later, as they settled\nthemselves in the little dining-room.  \"I can go at it better\nto-morrow.  See how you like this last chapter.\"\n\nBlix was enthusiastic over \"In Defiance of Authority.\" Condy had told\nher the outline of the story, and had read to her each chapter as he\nfinished it.\n\n\"It's the best thing you have ever done, Condy, and you know it.  I\nsuppose it has faults, but I don't care anything about them.  It's the\nstory itself that's so interesting.  After that first chapter of the\nboom restaurant and the exiles' club, nobody would want to lay the book\ndown.  You're doing the best work of your life so far, and you stick to\nit.\"\n\n\"It's grinding out copy for the Supplement at the same time that takes\nall the starch out of me.  You've no idea what it means to write all\nday, and then sit down and write all evening.\"\n\n\"I WISH you could get off the 'Times,'\" said Blix.  \"You're just giving\nthe best part of your life to hack work, and NOW it's interfering with\nyour novel.  I know you could do better work on your novel if you\ndidn't have to work on the 'Times,' couldn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, if you come to that, of course I could,\" he answered.  \"But they\nwon't give me a vacation.  I was sounding the editor on it day before\nyesterday.  No; I'll have to manage somehow to swing the two together.\"\n\n\"Well, let's not talk shop now.  Condy.  You need a rest.  Do you want\nto play poker?\"\n\nThey played for upward of an hour that evening, and Condy, as usual,\nlost.  His ill-luck was positively astonishing.  During the last two\nmonths he had played poker with Blix on an average of three or four\nevenings in the week, and at the close of every game it was Blix who\nhad all the chips.\n\nBlix had come to know the game quite as well, if not better, than he.\nShe could almost invariably tell when Condy held a good hand, but on\nher part could assume an air of indifference absolutely inscrutable.\n\n\"Cards?\" said Condy, picking up the deck after the deal.\n\n\"I'll stand pat, Condy.\"\n\n\"The deuce you say,\" he answered, with a stare.  \"I'll take three.\"\n\n\"I'll pass it up to you,\" continued Blix gravely.\n\n\"Well--well, I'll bet you five chips.\"\n\n\"Raise you twenty.\"\n\nCondy studied his hand, laid down the cards, picked them up again,\nscratched his head, and moved uneasily in his place.  Then he threw\ndown two high pairs.\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"I won't see you.  What did you have? Let's see, just\nfor the fun of it.\"\n\nBlix spread her cards on the table.\n\n\"Not a blessed thing!\" exclaimed Condy.  \"I might have known it.\nThere's my last dollar gone, too.  Lend me fifty cents, Blix.\"\n\nBlix shook her head.\n\n\"Why, what a little niggard!\" he exclaimed aggrievedly.  \"I'll pay them\nall back to you.\"\n\n\"Now, why should I lend you money to play against me? I'll not give you\na chip; and, besides, I don't want to play any more.  Let's stop.\"\n\n\"I've a mind to stop for good; stop playing even with you.\"\n\nBlix gave a little cry of joy.\n\n\"Oh, Condy, will you, could you? and never, never touch a card again?\nnever play for money? I'd be so happy--but don't unless you know you\nwould keep your promise.  I would much rather have you play every\nnight, down there at your club, than break your promise.\"\n\nCondy fell silent, biting thoughtfully at the knuckle of a forefinger.\n\n\"Think twice about it, Condy,\" urged Blix; \"because this would be for\nalways.\"\n\nCondy hesitated; then, abstractedly and as though speaking to himself:\n\n\"It's different now.  Before we took that--three months ago, I don't\nsay.  It was harder for me to quit then, but now--well, everything is\ndifferent now; and it would please you, Blixy!\"\n\n\"More than anything else I can think of, Condy.\"\n\nHe gave her his hand.\n\n\"That settles it,\" he said quietly.  \"I'll never gamble again, Blix.\"\n\nBlix gripped his hand hard, then jumped up, and, with a quick breath of\nsatisfaction, gathered up the cards and chips and flung them into the\nfireplace.\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad that's over with,\" she exclaimed, her little eyes\ndancing.  \"I've pretended to like it, but I've hated it all the time.\nYou don't know HOW I've hated it! What men can see in it to make them\nsit up all night long is beyond me.  And you truly mean, Condy, that\nyou never will gamble again? Yes, I know you mean it this time.  Oh,\nI'm so happy I could sing!\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, don't do that!\" he cried quickly.  \"You're a nice,\namiable girl, Blix, even if you're not pretty, and you--\"\n\n\"Oh, bother you!\" she retorted; \"but you promise?\"\n\n\"On my honor.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" she said quietly.\n\nBut even when \"loafing\" as he was this evening, Condy could not rid\nhimself of the thought and recollection of his novel; resting or\nwriting, it haunted him.  Otherwise he would not have been the\nstory-writer that he was.  From now on until he should set down the\nlast sentence, the \"thing\" was never to let him alone, never to allow\nhim a moment's peace.  He could think of nothing else, could talk of\nnothing else; every faculty of his brain, every sense of observation or\nimagination incessantly concentrated themselves upon this one point.\n\nAs they sat in the bay window watching the moon rise, his mind was\nstill busy with it, and he suddenly broke out:\n\n\"I ought to work some kind of a TREASURE into the yarn.  What's a story\nof adventure without a treasure? By Jove, Blix, I wish I could give my\nwhole time to this stuff! It's ripping good material, and it ought to\nbe handled as carefully as glass.  Ought to be worked up, you know.\"\n\n\"Condy,\" said Blix, looking at him intently, \"what is it stands in your\nway of leaving the 'Times'? Would they take you back if you left them\nlong enough to write your novel? You could write it in a month,\ncouldn't you, if you had nothing else to do? Suppose you left them for\na month--would they hold your place for you?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I think they would; but in the meanwhile, Blix--there's the\nrub.  I've never saved a cent out of my salary.  When I stop, my pay\nstops, and wherewithal would I be fed? What are you looking for in that\ndrawer--matches? Here, I've got a match.\"\n\nBlix faced about at the sideboard, shutting the drawer by leaning\nagainst it.  In both hands she held one of the delft sugar-bowls.  She\ncame up to the table, and emptied its contents upon the blue denim\ntable-cover--two or three gold pieces, some fifteen silver dollars, and\na handful of small change.\n\nDisregarding all Condy's inquiries, she counted it, making little piles\nof the gold and silver and nickel pieces.\n\n\"Thirty-five and seven is forty-two,\" she murmured, counting off on her\nfingers, \"and six is forty-eight, and ten is fifty-eight, and ten is\nsixty-eight; and here is ten, twenty, thirty, fifty-five cents in\nchange.\" She thrust it all toward him, across the table.  \"There,\" she\nsaid, \"is your wherewithal.\"\n\nCondy stared.  \"My wherewithal!\" he muttered.\n\n\"It ought to be enough for over a month.\"\n\n\"Where did you get all that? Whose is it?\"\n\n\"It's your money, Condy.  You loaned it to me, and now it has come in\nvery handy.\"\n\n\"I LOANED it to you?\"\n\n\"It's the money I won from you during the time you've been playing\npoker with me.  You didn't know it would amount to so much, did you?\"\n\n\"Pshaw, I'll not touch it!\" he exclaimed, drawing back from the money\nas though it was red-hot.\n\n\"Yes, you will,\" she told him.  \"I've been saving it up for you, Condy,\nevery penny of it, from the first day we played down there at the lake;\nand I always told myself that the moment you made up your mind to quit\nplaying, I would give it back to you.\"\n\n\"Why, the very idea!\" he vociferated, his hands deep in his pockets,\nhis face scarlet.  \"It's--it's preposterous, Blix! I won't let you TALK\nabout it even--I won't touch a nickel of that money.  But, Blix,\nyou're--you're--the finest woman I ever knew.  You're a man's woman,\nthat's what you are.\" He set his teeth.  \"If you loved a man, you'd be\na regular pal to him; you'd back him up, you'd stand by him till the\nlast gun was fired.  I could do ANYTHING if a WOMAN like you cared for\nme.  Why, Blix, I--you haven't any idea--\" He cleared his throat,\nstopping abruptly.\n\n\"But you must take this money,\" she answered; \"YOUR money.  If you\ndidn't, Condy, it would make me out nothing more nor less than a\ngambler.  I wouldn't have dreamed of playing cards with you if I had\never intended to keep one penny of your money.  From the very start I\nintended to keep it for you, and give it back to you so soon as you\nwould stop; and now you have a chance to put this money to a good use.\nYou don't have to stay on the 'Times' now.  You can't do your novel\njustice while you are doing your hack work at the same time, and I do\nso want 'In Defiance of Authority' to be a success.  I've faith in you,\nCondy.  I know if you got the opportunity you would make a success.\"\n\n\"But you and I have played like two men playing,\" exclaimed Condy.\n\"How would it look if Sargeant, say, should give me back the money he\nhad won from me? What a cad I would be to take it!\"\n\n\"That's just it--we've not played like two men.  Then I WOULD have been\na gambler.  I've played with you because I thought it would make a way\nfor you to break off with the habit; and knowing as I did how fond you\nwere of playing cards and how bad it was for you, how wicked it would\nhave been for me to have played with you in any other spirit! Don't you\nsee? And as it has turned out, you've given up playing, and you've\nenough money to make it possible for you to write your novel.  The\nCentennial Company have asked you to try a story of adventure for them,\nyou've found one that is splendid, you're just the man who could handle\nit, and now you've got the money to make it possible.  Condy,\" she\nexclaimed suddenly, \"don't you see your CHANCE? Aren't you a big enough\nman to see your chance when it comes? And, besides, do you think I\nwould take MONEY from you? Can't you understand? If you don't take this\nmoney that belongs to you, you would insult me.  That is just the way I\nwould feel about it.  You must see that.  If you care for me at all,\nyou'll take it.\"\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\nThe editor of the Sunday Supplement put his toothpick behind his ear\nand fixed Condy with his eyeglasses.\n\n\"Well, it's like this, Rivers,\" he said.  \"Of course, you know your own\nbusiness best.  If you stay on here with us, it will be all right.  But\nI may as well tell you that I don't believe I can hold your place for a\nmonth.  I can't get a man in here to do your work for just a month, and\nthen fire him out at the end of that time.  I don't like to lose you,\nbut if you have an opportunity to get in on another paper during this\nvacation of yours, you're at liberty to do so, for all of me.\"\n\n\"Then you think my chance of coming back here would be pretty slim if I\nleave for a month now?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nThere was a silence.  Condy hesitated; then he rose.\n\n\"I'll take the chance,\" he announced.\n\nTo Blix, that evening, as he told her of the affair, he said: \"It's\nneck or nothing now, Blix.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nBut did Blix care for him?\n\nIn the retired corner of his club, shut off by the Japanese screen, or\ngoing up and down the city to and from his work, or sitting with her in\nthe bay window of the little dining-room looking down upon the city,\nblurred in the twilight or radiant with the sunset, Condy asked himself\nthe question.  A score of times each day he came to a final, definite,\nnegative decision; and a score of times reopened the whole subject.\nBeyond the fact that Blix had enjoyed herself in his company during the\nlast months, Condy could find no sign or trace of encouragement; and\nfor that matter he told himself that the indications pointed rather in\nthe other direction.  She had no compunction in leaving him to go away\nto New York, perhaps never to return.  In less than a month now all\ntheir companionship was to end, and he would probably see the last of\nher.\n\nHe dared not let her know that at last he had really come to love\nher--that it was no pretence now; for he knew that with such\ndeclaration their \"good times\" would end even before she should go\naway.  But every day; every hour that they were together made it harder\nfor him to keep himself within bounds.\n\nWhat with this trouble on his mind and the grim determination with\nwhich he held to his work, Condy changed rapidly.  Blix had steadied\nhim, and a certain earnestness and seriousness of purpose, a certain\nSTRENGTH he had not known before, came swiftly into being.\n\nWas Blix to go away, leave him, perhaps for all time, and not know how\nmuch he cared? Would he speak before she went? Condy did not know.  It\nwas a question that circumstances would help him to decide.  He would\nnot speak, so he resolved, unless he was sure that she cared herself;\nand if she did, she herself would give him a cue, a hint whereon to\nspeak.  But days went by, the time set for Blix's departure drew nearer\nand nearer, and yet she gave him not the slightest sign.\n\nThese two interests had now absorbed his entire life for the\nmoment--his love for Blix, and his novel.  Little by little \"In\nDefiance of Authority\" took shape.  The boom restaurant and the club of\nthe exiles were disposed of, Billy Isham began to come to the front,\nthe filibustering expedition and Senora Estrada (with her torn calling\ncard) had been introduced, and the expedition was ready to put to sea.\nBut here a new difficulty was encountered.\n\n\"What do I know about ships?\" Condy confessed to Blix.  \"If Billy Isham\nis going to command a filibustering schooner, I've got to know\nsomething about a schooner--appear to, anyhow.  I've got to know\nnautical lingo, the real thing, you know.  I don't believe a REAL\nsailor ever in his life said 'belay there,' or 'avast.' We'll have to\ngo out and see Captain Jack; get some more technical detail.\"\n\nThis move was productive of the most delightful results.  Captain Jack\nwas all on fire with interest the moment that Condy and Blix told him\nof the idea.\n\n\"An' you're going to put Billy Isham in a book.  Well, strike me\nstraight, that's a snorkin' good idea.  I've always said that all Billy\nneeded was a ticket seller an' an advance agent, an' he was a whole\nshow in himself.\"\n\n\"We're going to send it East,\" said Blix, \"as soon as it's finished,\nand have it published.\"\n\n\"Well, it ought to make prime readin', Miss; an' that's a good fetchin'\ntitle, 'In Defiance of Authority.'\"\n\nRegularly Wednesday and Sunday afternoons, Blix and Condy came out to\nthe lifeboat station.  Captain Jack received them in sweater and\nvisored cap, and ushered them into the front room.\n\n\"Well, how's the yarn getting on?\" Captain Jack would ask.\n\nThen Condy would read the last chapter while the Captain paced the\nfloor, frowning heavily, smoking cigars, listening to every word.\nCondy told the story in the first person, as if Billy Isham's partner\nwere narrating scenes and events in which he himself had moved.  Condy\ncalled this protagonist \"Burke Cassowan,\" and was rather proud of the\nname.  But the captain would none of it.  Cassowan, the protagonist,\nwas simply \"Our Mug.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Condy would say, notebook in hand, \"now, Cap., we've got down to\nMazatlan.  Now I want to sort of organize the expedition in this next\nchapter.\"\n\n\"I see, I see,\" Captain Jack would exclaim, interested at once.  \"Wait\na bit till I take off my shoes.  I can think better with my shoes off\";\nand having removed his shoes, he would begin to pace the room in his\nstocking feet, puffing fiercely on his cigar as he warmed to the tale,\nblowing the smoke out through either ear, gesturing savagely, his face\nflushed and his eyes kindling.\n\n\"Well, now, lessee.  First thing Our Mug does when he gets to Mazatlan\nis to communicate his arrival to Senora Estrada--telegraphs, you know;\nand, by the way, have him use a cipher.\"\n\n\"What kind of cipher?\"\n\n\"Count three letters on from the right letter, see.  If you were\nspelling 'boat,' for instance, you would begin with an E, the third\nletter after B; then R for the O, being the third letter from O.  So\nyou'd spell 'boat,' ERDW; and Senora Estrada knows when she gets that\ndespatch that she must count three letters BACK from each letter to get\nthe right ones.  Take now such a cipher word as ULIOH.  That means\nRIFLE.  Count three letters back from each letter of ULIOH, and it'll\nspell RIFLE.  You can make up a lot of despatches like that, just to\nhave the thing look natural; savvy?\"\n\n\"Out of sight!\" muttered Condy, making a note.\n\n\"Then Our Mug and Billy Isham start getting a crew.  And Our Mug, he\nbuys the sextant there in Mazatlan--the sextant, that got out of order\nand spoiled everything.  Or, no; don't have it a sextant; have it a\nquadrant--an old-fashioned, ebony quadrant.  Have Billy Isham buy it\nbecause it was cheap.\"\n\n\"How did it get out of order, Captain Jack?\" inquired Blix.  \"That\nwould be a good technical detail, wouldn't it, Condy?\"\n\n\"Well, it's like this.  Our Mug an' Billy get a schooner that's so\nbally small that they have to do their cooking in the cabin; quadrant's\non a rack over the stove, and the heat warps the joints, so when Our\nMug takes his observation he gets fifty miles off his course and raises\nthe land where the government forces are watching for him.\"\n\n\"And here's another point, Cap.,\" said Condy.  \"We ought to work some\nkind of a treasure into this yarn; can't you think up something new and\noriginal in the way of a treasure? I don't want the old game of a\nburied chest of money.  Let's have him get track of something that's\nworth a fortune--something novel.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I see the idea,\" answered the Captain, striding over the\nfloor with great thuds of his stockinged feet.  \"Now, lessee; let me\nthink,\" he began, rubbing all his hair the wrong way.  \"We want\nsomething new and queer, something that ain't ever been written up\nbefore.  I tell you what! Here it is! Have Our Mug get wind of a little\nriver schooner that sunk fifty years before his time in one of the big\nSouth American rivers, during a flood--I heard of this myself.\nSchooner went down and was buried twenty feet under mud and sand; and\nsince that time--you know how the big rivers act--the whole blessed\ncourse of the river has changed at that point, and the schooner is on\ndry land, or rather twenty feet under it, and as sound as the day she\nwas chartered.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, have it that when she sank she had aboard of her a cargo of five\nhundred cases of whiskey, prime stuff, seven thousand quart bottles,\nsealed up tight as drums.  Now Our Mug--nor Billy Isham either--they\nain't born yesterday.  No, sir; they're right next to themselves! They\nfigure this way.  This here whiskey's been kept fifty years without\nbeing moved.  Now, what do you suppose seven thousand quart bottles of\nfifty-year-old whiskey would be worth?  Why, twenty dollars a quart\nwouldn't be too fancy.  So there you are; there's your treasure.  Our\nMug and Billy Isham have only got to dig through twenty feet of sand to\npick up a hundred thousand dollars, IF THEY CAN FIND THE SCHOONER.\"\n\nBlix clapped her hands with a little cry of delight, and Condy smote a\nknee, exclaiming:\n\n\"By Jove! that's as good as Loudon Dodds' opium ship! Why, Cap., you're\na treasure in yourself for a fellow looking for stories.\"\n\nThen after the notes were taken and the story talked over, Captain\nJack, especially if the day happened to be Sunday, would insist upon\ntheir staying to dinner--boiled beef and cabbage, smoking coffee and\npickles--that K. D. B. served in the little, brick-paved kitchen in the\nback of the station.  The crew messed in their quarters overhead.\n\nK. D. B. herself was not uninteresting.  Her respectability incased her\nlike armor plate, and she never laughed without putting three fingers\nto her lips.  She told them that she had at one time been a \"costume\nreader.\"\n\n\"A costume reader?\"\n\n\"Yes; reading extracts from celebrated authors in the appropriate\ncostume of the character.  It used to pay very well, and it was very\nrefined.  I used to do 'In a Balcony,' by Mister Browning, and 'Laska,'\nthe same evening! and it always made a hit.  I'd do 'In a Balcony'\nfirst, and I'd put on a Louis-Quinze-the-fifteenth gown and\nwig-to-match over a female cowboy outfit.  When I'd finished 'In a\nBalcony,' I'd do an exit, and shunt the gown and wig-to-match, and come\non as 'Laska,' with thunder noises off.  It was one of the strongest\neffects in my repertoire, and it always got me a curtain call.\"\n\nAnd Captain Jack would wag his head and murmur:\n\n\"Extraordinary! extraordinary!\"\n\nBlix and Condy soon noted that upon the occasion of each one of their\nvisits, K. D. B. found means to entertain them at great length with\nlong discussions upon certain subjects of curiously diversified\ncharacter.  Upon their first visit she elected to talk upon the Alps\nmountains.  The Sunday following it was bacteriology; on the next\nWednesday it was crystals; while for two hours during their next visit\nto the station, Condy and Blix were obliged to listen to K. D. B.'s\ninterminable discourse on the origin, history, and development of the\nkingdom of Denmark.  Condy was dumfounded.\n\n\"I never met such a person, man or woman, in all my life.  Talk about\neducation! Why, I think she knows everything!\"\n\n\"In Defiance of Authority\" soon began to make good progress, but Condy,\nonce launched upon technical navigation, must have Captain Jack at his\nelbow continually, to keep him from foundering.  In some sea novel he\nremembered to have come across the expression \"garboard streak,\" and\nfrom the context guessed it was to be applied to a detail of a vessel's\nconstruction.  In an unguarded moment he had written that his\nschooner's name \"was painted in showy gilt letters upon her garboard\nstreak.\"\n\n\"What's the garboard streak, Condy?\" Blix had asked, when he had read\nthe chapter to her.\n\n\"That's where they paint her name,\" he declared promptly.  \"I don't\nknow exactly, but I like the sound of it.\"\n\nBut the next day, when he was reading this same chapter to Captain\nJack, the latter suddenly interrupted with an exclamation as of acute\nphysical anguish.\n\n\"What's that? Read that last over again,\" he demanded.\n\n\"'When they had come within a few boat's lengths,'\" read Condy, \"'they\nwere able to read the schooner's name, painted in showy gilt letters\nupon her garboard streak.'\"\n\n\"My God!\" gasped the Captain, clasping his head.  Then, with a shout:\n\"Garboard streak! garboard streak? Don't you know that the garboard\nstreak is the last plank next the keel? You mean counter, not garboard\nstreak.  That regularly graveled me, that did!\"\n\nThey stayed to dinner with the couple that afternoon, and for half an\nhour afterward K. D. B. told them of the wonders of the caves of\nElephantis.  One would have believed that she had actually been at the\nplace.  But when she changed the subject to the science of\nfortification, Blix could no longer restrain herself.\n\n\"But it is really wonderful that you should know all these things!\nWhere did you find time to study so much?\"\n\n\"One must have an education,\" returned K. D. B. primly.\n\nBut Condy had caught sight of a half-filled book-shelf against the\nopposite wall, and had been suddenly smitten with an inspiration.  On a\nleaf of his notebook he wrote: \"Try her on the G's and H's,\" and found\nmeans to show it furtively to Blix.  But Blix was puzzled, and at the\nearliest opportunity Condy himself said to the retired costume reader:\n\n\"Speaking of fortifications, Mrs. Hoskins, Gibraltar now--that's a\nwonderful rock, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Rock!\" she queried.  \"I thought it was an island.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; it's a fortress.  They have a castle there--a castle,\nsomething like--well, like the old Schloss at Heidelberg.  Did you ever\nhear about or read about Heidelberg University?\"\n\nBut K. D. B. was all abroad now.  Gibraltar and Heidelberg were unknown\nsubjects to her, as were also inoculation, Japan, and Kosciusko.  Above\nthe G's she was sound; below that point her ignorance was benighted.\n\n\"But what is it, Condy?\" demanded Blix, as soon as they were alone.\n\n\"I've the idea,\" he answered, chuckling.  \"Wait till after Sunday to\nsee if I'm right; then I'll tell you.  It's a dollar to a paper dime,\nK. D. B. will have something for us by Sunday, beginning with an I.\"\n\nAnd she had.  It was Internal Revenue.\n\n\"Right! right!\" Condy shouted gleefully, as he and Blix were on their\nway home.  \"I knew it.  She's done with Ash--Bol, Bol--Car, and all\nthose, and has worked through Cod--Dem, and Dem--Eve.  She's down to\nHor--Kin now, and she'll go through the whole lot before she's\ndone--Kin--Mag, Mag--Mot, Mot--Pal, and all the rest.\"\n\n\"The Encyclopaedia?\"\n\n\"Don't you see it? No wonder she didn't know beans about Gibraltar! She\nhadn't come to the G's by then.\"\n\n\"She's reading the Encyclopaedia.\"\n\n\"And she gets the volumes on the installment plan, don't you see?\nReads the leading articles, and then springs 'em on us.  To know things\nand talk about em, that's her idea of being cultured.  'One must have\nan education.' Do you remember her saying that 'Oh, our matrimonial\nobjects are panning out beyond all expectation!\"\n\nWhat a delicious, never-to-be-forgotten month it was for those two!\nThere in the midst of life they were as much alone as upon a tropic\nisland.  Blix had deliberately freed herself from a world that had\ngrown distasteful to her; Condy little by little had dropped away from\nhis place among the men and the women of his acquaintance, and the two\ncame and went together, living in a little world of their own creation,\nhappy in each other's society, living only in the present, and asking\nnothing better than to be left alone and to their own devices.\n\nThey saw each other every day.  In the morning from nine till twelve,\nand in the afternoon until three, Condy worked away upon his novel, but\nnot an evening passed that did not see him and Blix in the dining-room\nof the little flat.  Thursdays and Sunday afternoons they visited the\nlife-boat station, and at other times prowled about the unfrequented\ncorners of the city, now passing an afternoon along the water front,\nwatching the departure of a China steamer or the loading of the great,\nsteel wheat ships; now climbing the ladder-like streets of Telegraph\nHill, or revisiting the Plaza, Chinatown, and the restaurant; or taking\nlong walks in the Presidio Reservation, watching cavalry and artillery\ndrills; or sitting for hours on the rocks by the seashore, watching the\nceaseless roll and plunge of the surf, the wheeling sea-birds, and the\nsleek-headed seals hunting the offshore fish, happy for a half-hour\nwhen they surprised one with his prey in his teeth.\n\nOne day, some three weeks before the end of the year, toward two in the\nafternoon, Condy sat in his usual corner of the club, behind the\nscreen, writing rapidly.  His coat was off and the stump of a cigar was\nbetween his teeth.  At his elbow was the rectangular block of his\nmanuscript.  During the last week the story had run from him with a\nfacility that had surprised and delighted him; words came to him\nwithout effort, ranging themselves into line with the promptitude of\nwell-drilled soldiery; sentences and paragraphs marched down the\nclean-swept spaces of his paper, like companies and platoons defiling\nupon review; his chapters were brigades that he marshaled at will,\nfalling them in one behind the other, each preceded by its\nchapter-head, like an officer in the space between two divisions.  In\nthe guise of a commander-in-chief sitting his horse upon an eminence\nthat overlooked the field of operations, Condy at last took in the\nentire situation at a glance, and, with the force and precision of a\nmachine, marched his forces straight to the goal he had set for himself\nso long a time before.\n\nThen at length he took a fresh penful of ink, squared his elbows, drew\ncloser to the desk, and with a single swift spurt of the pen wrote the\nlast line of his novel, dropping the pen upon the instant and pressing\nthe blotter over the words as though setting a seal of approval upon\nthe completed task.\n\n\"There!\" he muttered, between his teeth; \"I've done for YOU!\"\n\nThat same afternoon he read the last chapter to Blix, and she helped\nhim to prepare the manuscript for expressage.  She insisted that it\nshould go off that very day, and herself wrote the directions upon the\noutside wrapper.  Then the two went down together to the Wells Fargo\noffice, and \"In Defiance of Authority\" was sent on its journey across\nthe continent.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, as they came out of the express office and stood for a\nmoment upon the steps, \"now there's nothing to do but wait for the\nCentennial Company.  I do so hope we'll get their answer before I go\naway.  They OUGHT to take it.  It's just what they asked for.  Don't\nyou think they'll take it, Condy?\"\n\n\"Oh, bother that!\" answered Condy.  \"I don't care whether they take it\nor not.  How long now is it before you go, Blix?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nA week passed; then another.  The year was coming to a close.  In ten\ndays Blix would be gone.  Letters had been received from Aunt Kihm, and\nalso an exquisite black leather traveling-case, a present to her niece,\nfull of cut-glass bottles, ebony-backed brushes, and shell combs.  Blix\nwas to leave on the second day of January.  In the meanwhile she had\nbeen reading far into her first-year text-books, underscoring and\nannotating, studying for hours upon such subjects as she did not\nunderstand, so that she might get hold of her work the readier when it\ncame to class-room routine and lectures.  Hers was a temperament\nadmirably suited to the study she had chosen--self-reliant, cool, and\nrobust.\n\nBut it was not easy for her to go.  Never before had Blix been away\nfrom her home; never for longer than a week had she been separated from\nher father, nor from Howard and Snooky.  That huge city upon the\nAtlantic seaboard, with its vast, fierce life, where beat the heart of\nthe nation, and where beyond Aunt Kihm she knew no friend, filled Blix\nwith a vague sense of terror and of oppression.  She was going out into\na new life, a life of work and of study, a harsher life than she had\nyet known.  Her father, her friends, her home--all these were to be\nleft behind.  It was not surprising that Blix should be daunted at the\nprospect of so great a change in her life, now so close at hand.  But\nif the tears did start at times, no one ever saw them fall, and with a\ncourage that was all her own Blix watched the last days of the year\ntrooping past and the approach of the New Year that was to begin the\nnew life.\n\nBut Condy was thoroughly unhappy.  Those wonderful three months were at\nan end.  Blix was going.  In less than a week now she would be gone.\nHe would see the last of her.  Then what? He pictured himself--when he\nhad said good-by to her and the train had lessened to a smoky blur in\nthe distance--facing about, facing the life that must then begin for\nhim, returning to the city alone, picking up the routine again.  There\nwould be nothing to look forward to then; he would not see Blix in the\nafternoon; would not sit with her in the evening in the little\ndining-room of the flat overlooking the city and the bay; would not\nwake in the morning with the consciousness that before the sun would\nset he would see her again, be with her, and hear the sound of her\nvoice.  The months that were to follow would be one long ache, one\nlong, harsh, colorless grind without her.  How was he to get through\nthat first evening that he must pass alone? And she did not care for\nhim.  Condy at last knew this to be so.  Even the poor solace of\nknowing that she, too, was unhappy was denied him.  She had never loved\nhim, and never would.  He was a chum to her, nothing more.  Condy was\ntoo clear-headed to deceive himself upon this point.  The time was come\nfor her to go away, and she had given him no sign, no cue.\n\nThe last days passed; Blix's trunk was packed, her half section\nengaged, her ticket bought.  They said good-by to the old places they\nhad come to know so well--Chinatown, the Golden Balcony, the\nwater-front, the lake of San Andreas, Telegraph Hill, and Luna's--and\nhad bade farewell to Riccardo and to old Richardson.  They had left K.\nD. B. and Captain Jack until the last day.  Blix was to go on the\nsecond of January.  On New Year's Day she and Condy were to take their\nlast walk, were to go out to the lifeboat station, and then on around\nthe shore to the little amphitheatre of blackberry bushes--where they\nhad promised always to write one another on the anniversary of their\nfirst visit--and then for the last time climb the hill, and go across\nthe breezy downs to the city.\n\nThen came the last day of the old year, the last day but one that they\nwould be together.  They spent it in a long ramble along the\nwater-front, following the line of the shipping even as far as Meiggs's\nWharf.  They had come back to the flat for supper, and afterward, as\nsoon as the family had left them alone, had settled themselves in the\nbay window to watch the New Year in.\n\nThe little dining-room was dark, but for the indistinct blur of light\nthat came in through the window--a light that was a mingling of the\nafterglow, the new-risen moon, and the faint haze that the city threw\noff into the sky from its street lamps and electrics.  From where they\nsat they could look down, almost as from a tower, into the city's\nstreets.  Here a corner came into view; further on a great puff of\ngreen foliage--palms and pines side by side--overlooked a wall.  Here a\nstreet was visible for almost its entire length, like a stream of\nasphalt flowing down the pitch of the hill, dammed on either side by\nrows upon rows of houses; while further on the vague confusion of roofs\nand facades opened out around a patch of green lawn, the garden of some\nlarger residence.\n\nAs they looked and watched, the afterglow caught window after window,\ntill all that quarter of the city seemed to stare up at them from a\nthousand ruddy eyes.  The windows seemed infinite in number, the\nstreets endless in their complications: yet everything was deserted.\nAt this hour the streets were empty, and would remain so until\ndaylight.  Not a soul was stirring; no face looked from any of those\nmyriads of glowing windows; no footfall disturbed the silence of those\nasphalt streets.  There, almost within call behind those windows, shut\noff from those empty streets, a thousand human lives were teeming, each\nthe centre of its own circle of thoughts and words and actions; and yet\nthe solitude was profound, the desolation complete, the stillness\nunbroken by a single echo.\n\nThe night--the last night of the old year--was fine; the white, clear\nlight from a moon they could not see grew wide and clear over the city,\nas the last gleam of the sunset faded.  It was just warm enough for the\nwindow to be open, and for nearly three hours Condy and Blix sat\nlooking down upon the city in these last moments of the passing year,\nfeeling upon their faces an occasional touch of the breeze, that\ncarried with it the smell of trees and flowers from the gardens below\nthem, and the faint fine taint of the ocean from far out beyond the\nHeads.  But the scene was not in reality silent.  At times when they\nlistened intently, especially when they closed their eyes, there came\nto them a subdued, steady bourdon, profound, unceasing, a vast, numb\nmurmur, like no other sound in all the gamut of nature--the sound of a\ncity at night, the hum of a great, conglomerate life, wrought out there\nfrom moment to moment under the stars and under the moon, while the\nlast hours of the old year dropped quietly away.\n\nA star fell.\n\nSitting in the window, the two noticed it at once, and Condy stirred\nfor the first time in fifteen minutes.\n\n\"That was a very long one,\" he said, in a low voice.  \"Blix, you must\nwrite to me--we must write each other often.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she answered.  \"We must not forget each other; we have had\ntoo good a time for that.\"\n\n\"Four years is a long time,\" he went on.  \"Lots can happen in four\nyears.  Wonder what I'll be doing at the end of four years? We've had a\npleasant time while it lasted, Blix.\"\n\n\"Haven't we?\" she said, her chin on her hand, the moonlight shining in\nher little, dark-brown eyes.\n\nWell, he was going to lose her.  He had found out that he loved her\nonly in time to feel the wrench of parting from her all the more\nkeenly.  What was he to do with himself after she was gone?  What could\nhe turn to in order to fill up the great emptiness that her going would\nleave in his daily life? And was she never to know how dear she was to\nhim? Why not speak to her, why not tell her that he loved her? But\nCondy knew that Blix did not love him, and the knowledge of that must\nkeep him silent; he must hug his secret to him, like the Spartan boy\nwith his stolen fox, no matter how grievously it hurt him to do so.  He\nand Blix had lived through two months of rarest, most untroubled\nhappiness, with hardly more self-consciousness than two young and\nhealthy boys.  To bring that troublous, disquieting element of love\nbetween them--unrequited love, of all things--would be a folly.  She\nwould tell him--must in all honesty tell him that she did not love him,\nand all their delicious camaraderie would end in a \"scene.\" Condy,\nabove everything, wished to look back on those two months, after she\nhad gone, without being able to remember therein one single note that\njarred.  If the memory of her was all that he was to have, he resolved\nthat at least that memory should be perfect.\n\nAnd the love of her had made a man of him--he could not forget that;\nhad given to him just the strength that made it possible for him to\nkeep that resolute, grim silence now.  In those two months he had grown\nfive years; he was more masculine, more virile.  The very set of his\nmouth was different; between the eye-brows the cleft had deepened; his\nvoice itself vibrated to a heavier note.  No, no; so long as he should\nlive, he, man grown as he was, could never forget this girl of nineteen\nwho had come into his life so quietly, so unexpectedly, who had\ninfluenced it so irresistibly and so unmistakably for its betterment,\nand who had passed out of it with the passing of the year.\n\nFor a few moments Condy had been absent-mindedly snapping the lid of\nhis cigarette case, while he thought; now he selected a cigarette,\nreturned the case to his pocket, and fumbled for a match.  But the\nlittle gun-metal case he carried was empty.  Blix rose and groped for a\nmoment upon the mantel-shelf, then returned and handed him a match, and\nstood over him while he scraped it under the arm of the chair wherein\nhe sat.  Even when his cigarette was lighted she still stood there,\nlooking at him, the fingers of her hands clasped in front of her, her\nhair, one side of her cheek, her chin, and sweet, round neck outlined\nby the faint blur of light that came from the open window.  Then\nquietly she said:\n\n\"Well, Condy?\"\n\n\"Well, Blix?\"\n\n\"Just 'well'?\" she repeated.  \"Is that all? Is that all you have to say\nto me?\"\n\nHe gave a great start.\n\n\"Blix!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Is that all? And you are going to let me go away from you for so long,\nand say nothing more than that to me? You think you have been so\ncareful, think you have kept your secret so close! Condy, don't you\nsuppose I know? Do you suppose women are so blind? No, you don't need\nto tell me; I know--I've known it--oh, for weeks!\"\n\n\"You know--know--know what?\" he exclaimed, breathless.\n\n\"That you have been pretending that you did not love me.  I know that\nyou do love me--I know you have been trying to keep it from me for fear\nit would spoil our good times, and because we had made up our minds to\nbe chums, and have 'no more foolishness.' Once--in those days when we\nfirst knew each other--I knew you did not love me when you said you\ndid; but now, since--oh, since that afternoon in the Chinese\nrestaurant, remember?--I've known that you did love me, although you\npretended you didn't.  It was the pretence I wanted to be rid of; I\nwanted to be rid of it when you said you loved me and didn't, and I\nwant to be rid of it now when YOU pretend not to love me and I KNOW you\ndo,\" and Blix leaned back her head as she spoke that \"know,\" looking at\nhim from under her lids, a smile upon her lips.  \"It's the pretence\nthat I won't have,\" she added.  \"We must be sincere with each other,\nyou and I.\"\n\n\"Blix, do YOU love ME?\"\n\nCondy had risen to his feet, his breath was coming quick, his cigarette\nwas flung away, and his hands opened and shut swiftly.\n\n\"Oh, Blixy, little girl, do YOU love ME?\"\n\nThey stood there for a moment in the half dark, facing one another,\ntheir hearts beating, their breath failing them in the tension of the\ninstant.  There in that room, high above the city, a little climax had\ncome swiftly to a head, a crisis in two lives had suddenly developed.\nThe moment that had been in preparation for the last few months, the\nlast few years, the last few centuries, behold! it had arrived.\n\n\"Blix, do you love me?\"\n\nSuddenly it was the New Year.  Somewhere close at hand a chorus of\nchiming church bells sang together.  Far off in the direction of the\nwharves, where the great ocean steamships lay, came the glad, sonorous\nshouting of a whistle; from a nearby street a bugle called aloud.  And\nthen from point to point, from street to roof top, and from roof to\nspire, the vague murmur of many sounds grew and spread and widened,\nslowly, grandly; that profound and steady bourdon, as of an invisible\norgan swelling, deepening, and expanding to the full male diapason of\nthe city aroused and signaling the advent of another year.\n\nAnd they heard it, they two heard it, standing there face to face,\nlooking into each other's eyes, that unanswered question yet between\nthem, the question that had come to them with the turning of the year.\nIt was the old year yet when Condy had asked that question.  In that\nmoment's pause, while Blix hesitated to answer him, the New Year had\ncome.  And while the huge, vast note of the city swelled and vibrated,\nshe still kept silent.  But only for a moment.  Then she came closer to\nhim, and put a hand on each of his shoulders.\n\n\"Happy New Year, dear,\" she said.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\nOn New Year's Day, the last day they were to be together, Blix and\nCondy took \"their walk,\" as they had come to call it--the walk that\nincluded the lifeboat station, the Golden Gate, the ocean beach beyond\nthe old fort, the green, bare, flower-starred hills and downs, and the\nsmooth levels of the golf links.  Blix had been busy with the last\ndetails of her packing, and they did not get started until toward two\nin the afternoon.\n\n\"Strike me!\" exclaimed Captain Jack, as Blix informed him that she had\ncome to say good-by.  \"Why, ain't this very sudden-like, Miss Bessemer?\nHey, Kitty, come in here.  Here's Miss Bessemer come to say good-by;\ngoing to New York to-morrow.\"\n\n\"We'll regularly be lonesome without you, miss,\" said K. D. B., as she\ncame into the front room, bringing with her a brisk, pungent odor of\nboiled vegetables.  \"New York--such a town as it must be!  It was\ncalled Manhattan at first, you know, and was settled by the Dutch.\"\n\nEvidently K. D. B. had reached the N's.\n\nWith such deftness as she possessed, Blix tried to turn the\nconversation upon the first meeting of the retired sea captain and the\none-time costume reader, but all to no purpose.  The \"Matrimonial\nObjects\" were perhaps a little ashamed of their \"personals\" by now, and\nneither Blix nor Condy were ever to hear their version of the meeting\nin the back dining-room of Luna's Mexican restaurant.  Captain Jack\nwas, in fact, anxious to change the subject.\n\n\"Any news of the yarn yet?\" he suddenly inquired of Condy \"What do\nthose Eastern publishin' people think of Our Mug and Billy Isham and\nthe whiskey schooner?\"\n\nCondy had received the rejected manuscript of \"In Defiance of\nAuthority\" that morning, accompanied by a letter from the Centennial\nCompany.\n\n\"Well,\" he said in answer, \"they're not, as you might say, falling over\nthemselves trying to see who'll be the first to print it.  It's been\nreturned.\"\n\n\"The devil you say!\" responded the Captain.  \"Well, that's kind of\ndisappointin' to you, ain't it?\"\n\n\"But,\" Blix hastened to add, \"we're not at all discouraged.  We're\ngoing to send it off again right away.\"\n\nThen she said good-by to them.\n\n\"I dunno as you'll see me here when you come back, miss,\" said the\nCaptain, at the gate, his arm around K. D. B. \"I've got to schemin'\nagain.  Do you know,\" he added, in a low, confidential tone, \"that all\nthe mines in California send their clean-ups and gold bricks down to\nthe Selby smeltin' works once every week? They send 'em to San\nFrancisco first, and they are taken up to Selby's Wednesday afternoons\non a little stern-wheel steamer called the \"Monticello.\" All them\nbricks are in a box--dumped in like so much coal--and that box sets\njust under the wheel-house, for'ard.  How much money do you suppose\nthem bricks represent? Well, I'll tell you; last week they represented\nseven hundred and eighty thousand dollars.  Well, now, I got a chart of\nthe bay near Vallejo; the channel's all right, but there are mudflats\nthat run out from shore three miles.  Enough water for a whitehall, but\nnot enough for--well, for the patrol boat, for instance.  Two or three\nslick boys, of a foggy night--of course, I'm not in that kind of game,\nbut strike! it would be a deal now, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Don't you believe him, miss,\" put in K. D. B. \"He's just talking to\nshow off.\"\n\n\"I think your scheme of holding up a Cunard liner,\" said Condy, with\ngreat earnestness, \"is more feasible.  You could lay across her course\nand fly a distress signal.  She'd have to heave to.\"\n\n\"Yes, I been thinkin' o' that; but look here--what's to prevent the\nliner taking right after your schooner after you've got the stuff\naboard--just followin' you right around an' findin' out where you land?\"\n\n\"She'd be under contract to carry Government mails,\" contradicted\nCondy.  \"She couldn't do that.  You'd leave her mails aboard for just\nthat reason.  You wouldn't rob her of her mails; just so long as she\nwas carrying government mails she couldn't stop.\"\n\nThe Captain clapped his palm down upon the gate-post.\n\n\"Strike me straight! I never thought of that.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\nBlix and Condy went on; on along the narrow road upon the edge of the\nsalt marshes and tules that lay between the station and the Golden\nGate; on to the Golden Gate itself, and around the old grime-incrusted\nfort to the ocean shore, with its reaches of hard, white sand, where\nthe bowlders lay tumbled and the surf grumbled incessantly.\n\nThe world seemed very far away from them here on the shores of the\nPacific, on that first afternoon of the New Year.  They were supremely\nhappy, and they sufficed to themselves.  Condy had forgotten all about\nthe next day, when he must say good-by to Blix.\n\nIt did not seem possible, it was not within the bounds of possibility,\nthat she was to go away--that they two were to be separated.  And for\nthat matter, to-morrow was to-morrow.  It was twenty-four hours away.\nThe present moment was sufficient.\n\nThe persistence with which they clung to the immediate moment, their\nhappiness in living only in the present, had brought about a rather\ncurious condition of things between them.\n\nIn their love for each other there was no thought of marriage; they\nwere too much occupied with the joy of being together at that\nparticular instant to think of the future.  They loved each other, and\nthat was enough.  They did not look ahead further than the following\nday, and then but furtively, and only in order that their morrow's\nparting might intensify their happiness of to-day.  That New Year's Day\nwas to be the end of everything.  Blix was going; she and Condy would\nnever see each other again.  The thought of marriage--with its certain\nresponsibilities, its duties, its gravity, its vague, troublous\nseriousness, its inevitable disappointments--was even a little\ndistasteful to them.  Their romance had been hitherto without a flaw;\nthey had been genuinely happy in little things.  It was as well that it\nshould end that day, in all its pristine sweetness, unsullied by a\nsingle bitter moment, undimmed by the cloud of a single disillusion or\ndisappointment.  Whatever chanced to them in later years, they could at\nleast cherish this one memory of a pure, unselfish affection, young and\nunstained and almost without thought of sex, come and gone on the very\nthreshold of their lives.  This was the end, they both understood.\nThey were glad that it was to be so.  They did not even speak again of\nwriting to each other.\n\nThey found once more the little semicircle of blackberry bushes and the\nfallen log, half-way up the hill above the shore, and sat there a\nwhile, looking down upon the long green rollers, marching incessantly\ntoward the beach, and there breaking in a prolonged explosion of solid\ngreen water and flying spume.  And their glance followed their\nsucceeding ranks further and further out to sea, till the multitude\nblended into the mass--the vast, green, shifting mass that drew the eye\non and on, to the abrupt, fine line of the horizon.\n\nThere was no detail in the scene.  There was nothing but the great\nreach of the ocean floor, the unbroken plane of blue sky, and the bare\ngreen slope of land--three immensities, gigantic, vast, primordial.  It\nwas no place for trivial ideas and thoughts of little things.  The mind\nharked back unconsciously to the broad, simpler, basic emotions, the\nfundamental instincts of the race.  The huge spaces of earth and air\nand water carried with them a feeling of kindly but enormous\nforce--elemental force, fresh, untutored, new, and young.  There was\nbuoyancy in it; a fine, breathless sense of uplifting and exhilaration;\na sensation as of bigness and a return to the homely, human, natural\nlife, to the primitive old impulses, irresistible, changeless, and\nunhampered; old as the ocean, stable as the hills, vast as the\nunplumbed depths of the sky.\n\nCondy and Blix sat still, listening, looking, and watching--the\nintellect drowsy and numb; the emotions, the senses, all alive and\nbrimming to the surface.  Vaguely they felt the influence of the\nmoment.  Something was preparing for them.  From the lowest, untouched\ndepths in the hearts of each of them something was rising steadily to\nconsciousness and the light of day.  There is no name for such things,\nno name for the mystery that spans the interval between man and\nwoman--the mystery that bears no relation to their love for each other,\nbut that is something better than love, and whose coming savors of the\nmiraculous.\n\nThe afternoon had waned and the sun had begun to set when Blix rose.\n\n\"We should be going, Condy,\" she told him.\n\nThey started up the hill, and Condy said: \"I feel as though I had been\nsomehow asleep with my eyes wide open.  What a glorious sunset! It\nseems to me as though I were living double every minute; and oh! Blix,\nisn't it the greatest thing in the world to love each other as we do?\"\n\nThey had come to the top of the hill by now, and went on across the\nopen, breezy downs, all starred with blue iris and wild heliotrope.\nBlix drew his arm about her waist, and laid her cheek upon his shoulder\nwith a little caressing motion.\n\n\"And I do love you, dear,\" she said--\"love you with all my heart.  And\nit's for always, too; I know that.  I've been a girl until within the\nlast three or four days--just a girl, dearest; not very serious, I'm\nafraid, and not caring for anything else beyond, what was happening\nclose around me--don't you understand? But since I've found out how\nmuch I loved you and knew that you loved me--why, everything is changed\nfor me.  I'm not the same, I enjoy things that I never thought of\nenjoying before, and I feel so--oh, LARGER, don't you know?--and\nstronger, and so much more serious.  Just a little while ago I was only\nnineteen, but I think, dear, that by loving you I have become--all of a\nsudden and without knowing it--a woman.\"\n\nA little trembling ran through her with the words.  She stopped and put\nboth arms around his neck, her head tipped back, her eyes half closed,\nher sweet yellow hair rolling from her forehead.  Her whole dear being\nradiated with that sweet, clean perfume that seemed to come alike from\nher clothes, her neck, her arms, her hair, and mouth--the delicious,\nalmost divine, feminine aroma that was part of herself.\n\n\"You do love me, Condy, don't you, just as I love you?\"\n\nSuch words as he could think of seemed pitifully inadequate.  For\nanswer he could only hold her the closer.  She understood.  Her eyes\nclosed slowly, and her face drew nearer to his.  Just above a whisper,\nshe said:\n\n\"I love you, dear!\"\n\n\"I love you, Blix!\"\n\nAnd they kissed each other then upon the mouth.\n\nMeanwhile the sun had been setting.  Such a sunset! The whole world,\nthe three great spaces of sea and land and sky, were incarnadined with\nthe glory of it.  The ocean floor was a blinding red radiance, the\nhills were amethyst, the sky one gigantic opal, and they two seemed\npoised in the midst of all the chaotic glory of a primitive world.  It\nwas New Year's Day; the earth was new, the year was new, and their love\nwas new and strong.  Everything was before them.  There was no longer\nany past, no longer any present.  Regrets and memories had no place in\ntheir new world.  It was Hope, Hope, Hope, that sang to them and called\nto them and smote into life the new keen blood of them.\n\nThen suddenly came the miracle, like the flashing out of a new star,\nwhose radiance they felt but could not see, like a burst of music whose\nharmony they felt but could not hear.  And as they stood there alone in\nall that simple glory of sky and earth and sea, they knew all in an\ninstant that THEY WERE FOR EACH OTHER, forever and forever, for better\nor for worse, till death should them part.  Into their romance, into\ntheir world of little things, their joys of the moment, their happiness\nof the hour, had suddenly descended a great and lasting joy, the\nhappiness of the great, grave issues of life--a happiness so deep, so\nintense, as to thrill them with a sense of solemnity and wonder.\nInstead of being the end, that New Year's Day was but the\nbeginning--the beginning of their real romance.  All the fine, virile,\nmasculine energy of him was aroused and rampant.  All her sweet, strong\nwomanliness had been suddenly deepened and broadened.  In fine, he had\nbecome a man, and she woman.  Youth, life, and the love of man and\nwoman, the strength of the hills, the depth of the ocean, and the\nbeauty of the sky at sunset; that was what the New Year had brought to\nthem.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n\"It's good-by, dear, isn't it?\" said Blix.\n\nBut Condy would not have it so.\n\n\"No, no,\" he told her; \"no, Blix; no matter how often we separate after\nthis wonderful New Year's Day, no matter how far we are apart, WE two\nshall never, never say good-by.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're right, you're right!\" she answered, the tears beginning to\nshine in her little dark-brown eyes.  \"No; so long as we love each\nother, nothing matters.  There's no such thing as distance for us, is\nthere? Just think, you will be here on the shores of the Pacific, and I\non the shores of the Atlantic, but the whole continent can't come\nbetween US.\"\n\n\"And we'll be together again, Blix,\" he said; \"and it won't be very\nlong now.  Just give me time--a few years now.\"\n\n\"But so long as we love each other, TIME won't matter either.\"\n\n\"What are the tears for, Blixy?\" he asked, pressing his handkerchief to\nher cheek.\n\n\"Because this is the saddest and happiest day of my life,\" she\nanswered.  Then she pulled from him with a little laugh, adding: \"Look,\nCondy, you've dropped your letter.  You pulled it out just now with\nyour handkerchief.\"\n\nAs Condy picked it up, she noted the name of the Centennial Company\nupon the corner.\n\n\"It's the letter I got with the manuscript of the novel when they sent\nit back,\" he explained.\n\n\"What did they say?\"\n\n\"Oh, the usual thing.  I haven't read it yet.  Here's what they say.\"\nHe opened it and read:\n\n\n\"We return to you herewith the MS. of your novel, 'In Defiance of\nAuthority,' and regret that our reader does not recommend it as\navailable for publication at present.  We have, however, followed your\nwork with considerable interest, and have read a story by you, copied\nin one of our exchanges, under the title, 'A Victory Over Death,' which\nwe would have been glad to publish ourselves, had you given us the\nchance.\n\n\"Would you consider the offer of the assistant editorship of our\nQUARTERLY, a literary and critical pamphlet, that we publish in New\nYork, and with which we presume you are familiar? We do not believe\nthere would be any difficulty in the matter of financial arrangements.\nIn case you should decide to come on, we inclose R. R. passes via the\nA. T. & S. F., C. & A., and New York Central.\n\n\"Very truly,\n\n             \"THE CENTENNIAL PUBLISHING COMPANY,\n                                      \"NEW YORK.\"\n\n\nThe two exchanged glances.  But Blix was too excited to speak, and\ncould only give vent to a little, quivering, choking sigh.  The letter\nwas a veritable god from the machine, the one thing lacking to complete\ntheir happiness.\n\n\"I don't know how this looks to you,\" Condy began, trying to be calm,\n\"but it seems to me that this is--that this--this--\"\n\nBut what they said then they could never afterward remember.  The\ngolden haze of the sunset somehow got into their recollection of the\nmoment, and they could only recall the fact that they had been gayer in\nthat moment than ever before in all their lives.\n\nPerhaps as gay as they ever were to be again.  They began to know the\ndifference between gayety and happiness.  That New Year's Day, that\nsunset, marked for them an end and a beginning.  It was the end of\ntheir gay, irresponsible, hour-to-hour life of the past three months;\nand it was the beginning of a new life, whose possibilities of sorrow\nand of trouble, of pleasure and of happiness, were greater than aught\nthey had yet experienced.  They knew this--they felt it instinctively,\nas with a common impulse they turned and looked back upon the glowing\nearth and sea and sky, the breaking surf, the beach, the distant,\nrime-incrusted, ancient fort--all that scene that to their eyes stood\nfor the dear, free, careless companionship of those last few months.\nTheir new-found happiness was not without its sadness already.  All was\nover now; their solitary walks, the long, still evenings in the little\ndining-room overlooking the sleeping city, their excursions to Luna's,\ntheir afternoons spent in the golden Chinese balcony, their mornings on\nthe lake, calm and still and hot.  Forever and forever they had said\ngood-by to that life.  Already the sunset was losing its glory.\n\nThen, with one last look, they turned about and set their faces from it\nto the new life, to the East, where lay the Nation.  Out beyond the\npurple bulwarks of the Sierras, far off, the great, grim world went\nclashing through its grooves--the world that now they were to know, the\nworld that called to them, and woke them, and roused them.  Their\nlittle gayeties were done; the life of little things was all behind.\nNow for the future.  The sterner note had struck--work was to be done;\nthat, too, the New Year had brought to them--work for each of them,\nwork and the world of men.\n\nFor a moment they shrank from it, loth to take the first step beyond\nthe confines of the garden wherein they had lived so joyously and\nlearned to love each other; and as they stood there, facing the gray\nand darkening Eastern sky, their backs forever turned to the sunset,\nBlix drew closer to him, putting her hand in his, looking a little\ntimidly into his eyes.  But his arm was around her, and the strong\nyoung force that looked into her eyes from his gave her courage.\n\n\"A happy New Year, dear,\" she said.\n\n\"A very, very happy New Year, Blix,\" he answered.\n\n\n\n\n[The End]"
