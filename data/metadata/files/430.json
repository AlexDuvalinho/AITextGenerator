The firm was about the\nmost important and most famous--radical orators often said infamous--in\nNew York. The girl seemed, at a glance, about as unimportant and obscure\nan atom as the city hid in its vast ferment. She was blonde--tawny hair,\nfair skin, blue eyes. Aside from this hardly conclusive mark of identity\nthere was nothing positive, nothing definite, about her. She was neither\ntall nor short, neither fat nor thin, neither grave nor gay. She gave\nthe impression of a young person of the feminine gender--that, and\nnothing more. She was plainly dressed, like thousands of other girls,\nin darkish blue jacket and skirt and white shirt waist. Her boots and\ngloves were neat, her hair simply and well arranged. Perhaps in these\nrespects--in neatness and taste--she did excel the average, which is\ndepressingly low. But in a city where more or less strikingly pretty\nwomen, bent upon being seen, are as plentiful as the blackberries of\nKentucky's July--in New York no one would have given her a second look,\nthis quiet young woman screened in an atmosphere of self-effacement.\n\nShe applied to the head clerk. It so happened that need for another\ntypewriter had just arisen. She got a trial, showed enough skill to\nwarrant the modest wage of ten dollars a week; she became part of the\noffice force of twenty or twenty-five young men and women similarly\nemployed. As her lack of skill was compensated by industry and\nregularity, she would have a job so long as business did not slacken.\nWhen it did, she would be among the first to be let go. She shrank into\nher obscure niche in the great firm, came and went in mouse-like\nfashion, said little, obtruded herself never, was all but forgotten.\n\nNothing could have been more commonplace, more trivial than the whole\nincident. The name of the girl was Hallowell--Miss Hallowell. On the\nchief clerk's pay roll appeared the additional information that her\nfirst name was Dorothea. The head office boy, in one of his occasional\nspells of \"freshness,\" addressed her as Miss Dottie. She looked at him\nwith a puzzled expression; it presently changed to a slight, sweet\nsmile, and she went about her business. There was no rebuke in her\nmanner, she was far too self-effacing for anything so positive as the\nmildest rebuke. But the head office boy blushed awkwardly--why he did\nnot know and could not discover, though he often cogitated upon it. She\nremained Miss Hallowell.\n\nOpposites suggest each other. The dimmest personality in those offices\nwas the girl whose name imaged to everyone little more than a pencil,\nnotebook, and typewriting machine. The vividest personality was\nFrederick Norman. In the list of names upon the outer doors of the\nfirm's vast labyrinthine suite, on the seventeenth floor of the\nSyndicate Building, his name came last--and, in the newest lettering,\nsuggesting recentness of partnership. In age he was the youngest of the\npartners. Lockyer was archaic, Sanders an antique; Benchley, actually\nonly about fifty-five, had the air of one born in the grandfather class.\nLockyer the son dyed his hair and affected jauntiness, but was in fact\nnot many years younger than Benchley and had the stiffening jerky legs\nof one paying for a lively youth. Norman was thirty-seven--at the age\nthe Greeks extolled as divine because it means all the best of youth\ncombined with all the best of manhood. Some people thought Norman\nyounger, almost boyish. Those knew him uptown only, where he hid the man\nof affairs beneath the man of the world-that-amuses-itself. Some people\nthought he looked, and was, older than the age with which the\nbiographical notices credited him. They knew him down town only--where\nhe dominated by sheer force of intellect and will.\n\nAs has been said, the firm ranked among the greatest in New York.\nIt was a trusted counselor in large affairs--commercial, financial,\npolitical--in all parts of America, in all parts of the globe, for many\nof its clients were international traffickers. Yet this young man, this\nyoungest and most recent of the partners, had within the month forced a\nreorganization of the firm--or, rather, of its profits--on a basis that\ngave him no less than one half of the whole.\n\nHis demand threw his four associates into paroxysms of rage and\nfear--the fear serving as a wholesome antidote to the rage.\n\nIt certainly was infuriating that a youth, admitted to partnership\nbarely three years ago, should thus maltreat his associates. Ingrate\nwas precisely the epithet for him. At least, so they honestly thought,\nafter the quaint human fashion; for, because they had given him the\npartnership, they looked on themselves as his benefactors, and neglected\nas unimportant detail the sole and entirely selfish reason for their\ngraciousness. But enraged though these worthy gentlemen were, and\neagerly though they longed to treat the \"conceited and grasping upstart\"\nas he richly deserved, they accepted his ultimatum. Even the venerable\nand venerated Lockyer--than whom a more convinced self-deceiver on the\nsubject of his own virtues never wore white whiskers, black garments,\nand the other badges of eminent respectability--even old Joseph Lockyer\ncould not twist the acceptance into another manifestation of the\nbenevolence of himself and his associates. They had to stare the\ngrimacing truth straight in the face; they were yielding because they\ndared not refuse. To refuse would mean the departure of Norman with the\nfirm's most profitable business. It costs heavily to live in New York;\nthe families of successful men are extravagant; so conduct unbecoming a\ngentleman may not there be resented if to resent is to cut down one's\nincome. The time was, as the dignified and nicely honorable Sanders\nobserved, when these and many similar low standards did not prevail in\nthe legal profession. But such is the frailty of human nature--or so\nsavage the pressure of the need of the material necessities of civilized\nlife, let a profession become profitable or develop possibilities of\nprofit--even the profession of statesman, even that of lawyer--or\ndoctor--or priest--or wife--and straightway it begins to tumble down\ntoward the brawl and stew of the market place.\n\nIn a last effort to rouse the gentleman in Norman or to shame him into\npretense of gentlemanliness, Lockyer expostulated with him like a\nprophet priest in full panoply of saintly virtue. And Lockyer was\npassing good at that exalted gesture. He was a Websterian figure,\nwith the venality of the great Daniel in all its pompous dignity\nmodernized--and correspondingly expanded. He abounded in those idealist\nsonorosities that are the stock-in-trade of all solemn old-fashioned\nfrauds. The young man listened with his wonted attentive courtesy until\nthe dolorous appeal disguised as fatherly counsel came to an end. Then\nin his blue-gray eyes appeared the gleam that revealed the tenacity and\nthe penetration of his mind. He said:\n\n\"Mr. Lockyer, you have been absent six years--except an occasional two\nor three weeks--absent as American Ambassador to France. You have done\nnothing for the firm in that time. Yet you have not scorned to take\nprofits you did not earn. Why should I scorn to take profits I do earn?\"\n\nMr. Lockyer shook his picturesque head in sad remonstrance at this\nvulgar, coarse, but latterly frequent retort of insurgent democracy upon\nindignant aristocracy. But he answered nothing.\n\n\"Also,\" proceeded the graceless youth in the clear and concise way that\nwon the instant attention of juries and Judges, \"also, our profession\nis no longer a profession but a business.\" His humorous eyes twinkled\nmerrily. \"It divides into two parts--teaching capitalists how to loot\nwithout being caught, and teaching them how to get off if by chance\nthey have been caught. There are other branches of the profession, but\nthey're not lucrative, so we do not practice them. Do I make myself\nclear?\"\n\nMr. Lockyer again shook his head and sighed.\n\n\"I am not an Utopian,\" continued young Norman. \"Law and custom\npermit--not to say sanctify--our sort of business. So--I do my best. But\nI shall not conceal from you that it's distasteful to me. I wish to get\nout of it. I shall get out as soon as I've made enough capital to assure\nme the income I have and need. Naturally, I wish to gather in the\nnecessary amount as speedily as possible.\"\n\n\"Fred, my boy, I regret that you take such low views of our noble\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Yes--as a profession it is noble. But not as a practice. _My_ regret is\nthat it invites and compels such low views.\"\n\n\"You will look at these things more--more mellowly when you are older.\"\n\n\"I doubt if I'll ever rise very high in the art of self-deception,\"\nreplied Norman. \"If I'd had any bent that way I'd not have got so far so\nquickly.\"\n\nIt was a boastful remark--of a kind he, and other similar young men,\nhave the habit of making. But from him it did not sound boastful--simply\na frank and timely expression of an indisputable truth, which indeed it\nwas. Once more Mr. Lockyer sighed. \"I see you are incorrigible,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"I have not acted without reflection,\" said Norman.\n\nAnd Lockyer knew that to persist was simply to endanger his dignity.\n\"I am getting old,\" said he. \"Indeed, I am old. I have gotten into the\nhabit of leaning on you, my boy. I can't consent to your going, hard\nthough you make it for us to keep you. I shall try to persuade our\ncolleagues to accept your terms.\"\n\nNorman showed neither appreciation nor triumph. He merely bowed\nslightly. And so the matter was settled. Instead of moving into the\nsuite of offices in the Mills Building on which he had taken an option,\nyoung Norman remained where he had been toiling for twelve years.\n\nAfter this specimen of Norman's quality, no one will be surprised to\nlearn that in figure he was one of those solidly built men of medium\nheight who look as if they were made to sustain and to deliver shocks,\nto bear up easily under heavy burdens; or that his head thickly covered\nwith fairish hair, was hatchet-shaped with the helve or face suggesting\nthat while it could and would cleave any obstacle, it would wear a merry\nif somewhat sardonic smile the while. No one had ever seen Norman angry,\nthough a few persevering offenders against what he regarded as his\nrights had felt the results of swift and powerful action of the same\nsort that is usually accompanied--and weakened--by outward show of\nanger. Invariably good-humored, he was soon seen to be more dangerous\nthan the men of flaring temper. In most instances good humor of\nthus unbreakable species issues from weakness, from a desire to\nconciliate--usually with a view to plucking the more easily. Norman's\ngood humor arose from a sense of absolute security which in turn was the\nproduct of confidence in himself and amiable disdain for his fellow men.\nThe masses he held in derision for permitting the classes to rule and\nrob and spit upon them. The classes he scorned for caring to occupy\nthemselves with so cheap and sordid a game as the ruling, robbing, and\nspitting aforesaid. Coming down to the specific, he despised men as\nindividuals because he had always found in each and everyone of them a\nweakness that made it easy for him to use them as he pleased.\n\nNot an altogether pleasant character, this. But not so unpleasant as it\nmay seem to those unable impartially to analyze human character, even\ntheir own--especially their own. And let anyone who is disposed to\ncondemn Norman first look within himself--in some less hypocritical and\nself-deceiving moment, if he have such moments--and let him note what\nare the qualities he relies upon and uses in his own struggle to save\nhimself from being submerged and sunk. Further, there were in Norman\nmany agreeable qualities, important, but less fundamental, therefore\nless deep-hidden--therefore generally regarded as the real man and as\nthe cause of his success in which they in fact had almost no part. He\nwas, for example, of striking physical appearance, was attractively\ndressed and mannered, was prodigally generous. Neither as lawyer nor as\nman did he practice justice. But while as lawyer he practiced injustice,\nas man he practiced mercy. Whenever a weakling appealed to him for\nprotection, he gave it--at times with splendid recklessness as to the\ncost to himself in antagonisms and enmities. Indeed, so great were\nthe generosities of his character that, had he not been arrogant,\ndisdainful, self-confident, resolutely and single-heartedly ambitious,\nhe must inevitably have ruined himself--if he had ever been able to rise\nhigh enough to be worthy the dignity of catastrophe.\n\nSuccessful men are usually trying persons to know well. Lambs, asses,\nand chickens do not associate happily with lions, wolves, and hawks--nor\ndo birds and beasts of prey get on well with one another. Norman was\nregarded as \"difficult\" by his friends--by those of them who happened to\nget into the path of his ambition, in front of instead of behind him,\nand by those who fell into the not unnatural error of misunderstanding\nhis good nature and presuming upon it. His clients regarded him as\ninsolent. The big businesses, seeking the rich spoils of commerce,\nfrequent highly perilous waters. They need skillful pilots. Usually\nthese lawyer-pilots \"know their place\" and put on no airs upon the\nquarter-deck while they are temporarily in command. Not so Norman. He\ntook the full rank, authority--and emoluments--of commander. And as his\npower, fame, and income were swiftly growing, it is fair to assume that\nhe knew what he was about.\n\nHe was admired--extravagantly admired--by young men with not too broad a\nvein of envy. He was no woman hater--anything but that. Indeed, those\nwho wished him ill had from time to time hoped to see him tumble down,\nthrough miscalculation in some of his audacities with women. No--he did\nnot hate women. But there were several women who hated him--or tried to;\nand if wounded vanity and baffled machination be admitted as just causes\nfor hatred, they had cause. He liked--but he did not wholly trust. When\nhe went to sleep, it was not where Delilah could wield the shears. A\nmost irritating prudence--irritating to friends and intimates of all\ndegrees and kinds, in a race of beings with a mania for being trusted\nimplicitly but with no balancing mania for deserving trust of the\nimplicit variety.\n\nAnd he ate hugely--and whatever he pleased. He could drink beyond\nbelief, all sorts of things, with no apparent ill effect upon either\nbody or brain. He had all the appetites developed abnormally, and\nabnormal capacity for gratifying them. Where there was one man who\nenvied him his eminence, there were a dozen who envied him his physical\ncapacities. We cannot live and act without doing mischief, as well as\nthat which most of us would rather do, provided that in the doing we are\nnot ourselves undone. Probably in no direction did Norman do so much\nmischief as in unconsciously leading men of his sets down town and up to\nimitate his colossal dissipations--which were not dissipation for him\nwho was abnormal.\n\nWithal, he was a monster for work. There is not much truth in men's\nunending talk of how hard they work or are worked. The ravages from\ntheir indulgences in smoking, drinking, gallantry, eating too much and\ntoo fast and too often, have to be explained away creditably, to\nthemselves and to others--notably to the wives or mothers who nurse them\nand suffer from their diminishing incomes. Hence the wailing about work.\nBut once in a while a real worker appears--a man with enormous ingenuity\nat devising difficult tasks for himself and with enormous persistence in\ndoing them. Frederick Norman was one of these blue-moon prodigies.\n\nObviously, such a man could not but be observed and talked about.\nEndless stories, some of them more or less true, most of them\napocryphal, were told of him--stories of his shrewd, unexpected moves in\nbig cases, of his witty retorts, of his generosities, of his\npeculiarities of dress, of eating and drinking; stories of his\nadventures with women. Whatever he did, however trivial, took color and\ncharm from his personality, so easy yet so difficult, so simple yet so\ncomplex, so baffling. Was he wholly selfish? Was he a friend to almost\nanybody or to nobody? Did he ever love? No one knew, not even himself,\nfor life interested him too intensely and too incessantly to leave him\ntime for self-analysis. One thing he was certain of; he hated nobody,\nenvied nobody. He was too successful for that.\n\nHe did as he pleased. And, on the whole, he pleased to do far less\ninconsiderately than his desires, his abilities, and his opportunities\ntempted. Have not men been acclaimed good for less?\n\nIn the offices, where he was canvased daily by partners, clerks,\neveryone down to the cleaners whose labors he so often delayed, opinion\nvaried from day to day. They worshiped him; they hated him. They loved\nhim; they feared him. They regarded him as more than human, as less than\nhuman; but never as just human--though always as endowed with fine human\nvirtues and even finer human weaknesses. Miss Tillotson, next to the\nhead clerk in rank and pay--and a pretty and pushing young\nperson--dreamed of getting acquainted with him--really well acquainted.\nIt was a vain dream. For him, between up town and down town a great gulf\nwas fixed. Also, he had no interest in or ammunition for sparrows.\n\nIt was in December that Miss Hallowell--Miss Dorothea Hallowell--got her\ntemporary place at ten dollars a week--that obscure event, somewhat like\na field mouse taking quarters in a horizon-bounded grain field. It was\nnot until mid-February that she, the palest of personalities, came into\ndirect contact with Norman, about the most refulgent. This is how it\nhappened.\n\nLate in that February afternoon, an hour or more after the last of the\noffice force should have left, Norman threw open the door of his private\noffice and glanced round at the rows on rows of desks. The lights in the\nbig room were on, apparently only because he was still within. With an\nexclamation of disappointment he turned to re-enter his office. He heard\nthe click of typewriter keys. Again he looked round, but could see no\none.\n\n\"Isn't there some one here?\" he cried. \"Don't I hear a typewriter?\"\n\nThe noise stopped. There was a slight rustling from a far corner, beyond\nhis view, and presently he saw advancing a slim and shrinking slip of a\ngirl with a face that impressed him only as small and insignificant. In\na quiet little voice she said, \"Yes, sir. Do you wish anything?\"\n\n\"Why, what are you doing here?\" he asked. \"I don't think I've ever seen\nyou before.\"\n\n\"Yes. I took dictation from you several times,\" replied she.\n\nHe was instantly afraid he might have hurt her feelings, and he, who in\nthe days when he was far, far less than now, had often suffered from\nthat commonplace form of brutality, was most careful not to commit it.\n\"I never know what's going on round me when I'm thinking,\" explained he,\nthough he was saying to himself that the next time he would probably\nagain be unable to remember one with nothing distinctive to fix\nidentity. \"You are--Miss----?\"\n\n\"Miss Hallowell.\"\n\n\"How do you happen to be here? I've given particular instructions that\nno one is ever to be detained after hours.\"\n\nA little color appeared in the pale, small face--and now he saw that she\nhad a singularly fair and smooth skin, singularly beautiful--and he\nwondered why he had not noticed it before. Being a close observer, he\nhad long ago noted and learned to appreciate the wonders of that most\namazing of tissues, the human skin; and he had come to be a connoisseur.\n\"I'm staying of my own accord,\" said she.\n\n\"They ought not to give you so much work,\" said he. \"I'll speak about\nit.\"\n\nInto the small face came the look of the frightened child--a fascinating\nlook. And suddenly he saw that she had lovely eyes, clear, expressive,\ninnocent. \"Please don't,\" she pleaded, in the gentle quiet voice. \"It\nisn't overwork. I did a brief so badly that I was ashamed to hand it in.\nI'm doing it again.\"\n\nHe laughed, and a fine frank laugh he had when he was in the mood.\nAt once a smile lighted up her face, danced in her eyes, hovered\nbewitchingly about her lips--and he wondered why he had not at first\nglance noted how sweet and charmingly fresh her mouth was. \"Why, she's\nbeautiful,\" he said to himself, the manly man's inevitable interest\nin feminine charm wide awake. \"Really beautiful. If she had a\nfigure--and were tall--\" As he thought thus, he glanced at her figure.\nA figure? Tall? She certainly was tall--no, she wasn't--yes, she\nwas. No, not tall from head to foot, but with the most captivating\nlong lines--long throat, long bust, long arms, long in body and in\nlegs--long and slender--yet somehow not tall. He--all this took but an\ninstant--returned his glance to her face. He was startled. The beauty\nhad fled, leaving not a trace behind. Before him wavered once more a\nsmall insignificance. Even her skin now seemed commonplace.\n\nShe was saying, \"Did you wish me to do something?\"\n\n\"Yes--a letter. Come in,\" he said abruptly.\n\nOnce more the business in hand took possession of his mind. He became\nunconscious of her presence. He dictated slowly, carefully choosing his\nwords, for perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then he stopped and paced up\nand down, revolving a new idea, a new phase of the business, that had\nflashed upon him. When he had his thoughts once more in form he turned\ntoward the girl, the mere machine. He gazed at her in amazement. When he\nhad last looked, he had seen an uninteresting nonentity. But that was\nnot this person, seated before him in the same garments and with the\nsame general blondness. That person had been a girl. This time the\ntransformation was not into the sweet innocence of lovely childhood, but\ninto something incredibly different. He was gazing now at a woman, a\nbeautiful world-weary woman, one who had known the joys and then the\nsorrows of life and love. Heavy were the lids of the large eyes gazing\nmournfully into infinity--gazing upon the graves of a life, the long,\nlong vista of buried joys. Never had he seen anything so sad or so\nlovely as her mouth. The soft, smooth skin was not merely pale; its\npallor was that of wakeful nights, of weeping until there were no more\ntears to drain away.\n\n\"Miss Hallowell--\" he began.\n\nShe startled; and like the flight of an interrupted dream, the woman he\nhad been seeing vanished. There sat the commonplace young person he had\nfirst seen. He said to himself: \"I must be a little off my base\nto-night,\" and went on with the dictation. When he finished she withdrew\nto transcribe the letter on the typewriter. He seated himself at his\ndesk and plunged into the masses of documents. He lost the sense of his\nsurroundings until she stood beside him holding the typewritten pages.\nHe did not glance up, but seized the sheets to read and sign.\n\n\"You may go,\" said he. \"I am very much obliged to you.\" And he\ncontrived, as always, to put a suggestion of genuineness into the\ncustomary phrase.\n\n\"I'm afraid it's not good work,\" said she. \"I'll wait to see if I am to\ndo any of it over.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said he. And he looked up--to find himself gazing at\nstill another person, wholly different from any he had seen before. The\nothers had all been women--womanly women, full of the weakness, the\ndelicateness rather, that distinguishes the feminine. This woman he was\nlooking at now had a look of strength. He had thought her frail. He was\nseeing a strong woman--a splendidly healthy body, with sinews of steel\nmost gracefully covered by that fair smooth skin of hers. And her\nfeatures, too--why, this girl was a person of character, of will.\n\nHe glanced through the pages. \"All right--thank you,\" he said hastily.\n\"Please don't stay any longer. Leave the other thing till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No--it has to be done to-night.\"\n\n\"But I insist upon your going.\"\n\nShe hesitated, said quietly, \"Very well,\" and turned to go.\n\n\"And you mustn't do it at home, either.\"\n\nShe made no reply, but waited respectfully until it was evident he\nwished to say no more, then went out. He bundled together his papers,\nsealed and stamped and addressed his letter, put on his overcoat and hat\nand crossed the outer office on his way to the door. It was empty; she\nwas gone. He descended in the elevator to the street, remembered that he\nhad not locked one of his private cases, returned. As he opened the\nouter door he heard the sound of typewriter keys. In the corner, the\nobscure, sheltered corner, sat the girl, bent with childlike gravity\nover her typewriter. It was an amusing and a touching sight--she looked\nso young and so solemnly in earnest.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you to go home?\" he called out, with mock sternness.\n\nUp she sprang, her hand upon her heart. And once more she was beautiful,\nbut once more it was in a way startlingly, unbelievably different from\nany expression he had seen before.\n\n\"Now, really. Miss--\" He had forgotten her name. \"You must not stay on\nhere. We aren't such slave drivers as all that. Go home, please. I'll\ntake the responsibility.\"\n\nShe had recovered her equanimity. In her quiet, gentle voice--but it no\nlonger sounded weak or insignificant--she said, \"You are very kind, Mr.\nNorman. But I must finish my work.\"\n\n\"Haven't I said I'd take the blame?\"\n\n\"But you can't,\" replied she. \"I work badly. I seem to learn slowly. If\nI fall behind, I shall lose my place--sooner or later. It was that way\nwith the last place I had. If you interfered, you'd only injure me. I've\nhad experience. And--I must not lose my place.\"\n\nOne of the scrub women thrust her mussy head and ragged, shapeless body\nin at the door. With a start Norman awoke to the absurdity of his\nsituation--and to the fact that he was placing the girl in a\ncompromising position. He shrugged his shoulders, went in and locked the\ncabinet, departed.\n\n\"What a queer little insignificance she is!\" thought he, and dismissed\nher from mind.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nMany and fantastic are the illusions the human animal, in its ignorance\nand its optimism, devises to change life from a pleasant journey along a\nplain road into a fumbling and stumbling and struggling about in a fog.\nOf these hallucinations the most grotesque is that the weak can come\ntogether, can pass a law to curb the strong, can set one of their number\nto enforce it, may then disperse with no occasion further to trouble\nabout the strong. Every line of every page of history tells how the\nstrong--the nimble-witted, the farsighted, the ambitious--have worked\ntheir will upon their feebler and less purposeful fellow men, regardless\nof any and all precautions to the contrary. Conditions have improved\nonly because the number of the strong has increased. With so many lions\nat war with each other not a few rabbits contrive to avoid perishing in\nthe nest.\n\nNorman's genius lay in ability to take away from an adversary the legal\nweapons implicitly relied upon and to arm his client with them. No man\nunderstood better than he the abysmal distinction between law and\njustice; no man knew better than he how to compel--or to assist--courts\nto apply the law, so just in the general, to promoting injustice in the\nparticular. And whenever he permitted conscience a voice in his internal\ndebates--it was not often--he heard from it its usual servile\napprobation: How can the reign of justice be more speedily brought about\nthan by making the reign of law--lawyer law--intolerable?\n\nAbout a fortnight after the trifling incident related in the previous\nchapter, Norman had to devise a secret agreement among several of the\nmost eminent of his clients. They wished to band together, to do a thing\nexpressly forbidden by the law; they wished to conspire to lower wages\nand raise prices in several railway systems under their control. But\nnone would trust the others; so there must be something in writing, laid\naway in a secret safety deposit box along with sundry bundles of\nsecurities put up as forfeit, all in the custody of Norman. When he had\nworked out in his mind and in fragmentary notes the details of their\nagreement, he was ready for some one to do the clerical work. The some\none must be absolutely trustworthy, as the plain language of the\nagreement would make clear to the dullest mind dazzling opportunities\nfor profit--not only in stock jobbing but also in blackmail. He rang for\nTetlow, the head clerk. Tetlow--smooth and sly and smug, lacking only\ncourageous initiative to make him a great lawyer, but, lacking that,\nlacking all--Tetlow entered and closed the door behind him.\n\nNorman leaned back in his desk chair and laced his fingers behind his\nhead. \"One of your typewriters is a slight blonde girl--sits in the\ncorner to the far left--if she's still here.\"\n\n\"Miss Hallowell,\" said Tetlow. \"We are letting her go at the end of this\nweek. She's nice and ladylike, and willing--in fact, most anxious to\nplease. But the work's too difficult for her. She's rather--rather--well,\nnot exactly stupid, but slow.\"\n\n\"Um,\" said Norman reflectively. \"There's Miss Bostwick--perhaps she'll\ndo.\"\n\n\"Miss Bostwick got married last week.\"\n\nNorman smiled. He remembered the girl because she was the oldest and\nhomeliest in the office. \"There's somebody for everybody--eh, Tetlow?\"\n\n\"He was a lighthouse keeper,\" said Tetlow. \"There's a story that he\nadvertised for a wife. But that may be a joke.\"\n\n\"Why not that Miss--Miss Halloway?\" mused Norman.\n\n\"Miss Hallowell,\" corrected Tetlow.\n\n\"Hallowell--yes. Is she--_very_ incompetent?\n\n\"Not exactly that. But business is slackening--and she's been only\ntemporary--and----\"\n\nNorman cut him off with, \"Send her in.\"\n\n\"You don't wish her dismissed? I haven't told her yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not interfering in your department. Do as you like. . . .\nNo--in this case--let her stay on for the present.\"\n\n\"I can use her,\" said Tetlow. \"And she gets only ten a week.\"\n\nNorman frowned. He did not like to _hear_ that an establishment in which\nhe had control paid less than decent living wages--even if the market\nprice did excuse--yes, compel it. \"Send her in,\" he repeated. Then, as\nTetlow was about to leave, \"She is trustworthy?\"\n\n\"All our force is. I see to that, Mr. Norman.\"\n\n\"Has she a young man--steady company, I think they call it?\"\n\n\"She has no friends at all. She's extremely shy--at least, reserved.\nLives with her father, an old crank of an analytical chemist over in\nJersey City. She hasn't even a lady friend.\"\n\n\"Well, send her in.\"\n\nA moment later Norman, looking up from his work, saw the dim slim\nnonentity before him. Again he leaned back and, as he talked with her,\nstudied her face to make sure that his first judgment was correct. \"Do\nyou stay late every night?\" asked he smilingly.\n\nShe colored a little, but enough to bring out the exquisite fineness of\nher white skin. \"Oh, I don't mind,\" said she, and there was no\nembarrassment in her manner. \"I've got to learn--and doing things over\nhelps.\"\n\n\"Nothing equal to it,\" declared Norman. \"You've been to school?\"\n\n\"Only six weeks,\" confessed she. \"I couldn't afford to stay longer.\"\n\n\"I mean the other sort of school--not the typewriting.\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes,\" said she. And once more he saw that extraordinary\ntransformation. She became all in an instant delicately, deliciously\nlovely, with the moving, in a way pathetic loveliness of sweet children\nand sweet flowers. Her look was mystery; but not a mystery of guile. She\nevidently did not wish to have her past brought to view; but it was\nequally apparent that behind it lay hid nothing shameful, only the sad,\nperhaps the painful. Of all the periods of life youth is the best fitted\nto bear deep sorrows, for then the spirit has its full measure of\nelasticity. Yet a shadow upon youth is always more moving than the\nshadows of maturer years--those shadows that do not lie upon the surface\nbut are heavy and corroding stains. When Norman saw this shadow upon her\nyouth, so immature-looking, so helpless-looking, he felt the first\nimpulse of genuine interest in her. Perhaps, had that shadow happened to\nfall when he was seeing her as the commonplace and colorless little\nstruggler for bread, and seeming doomed speedily to be worsted in the\nstruggle--perhaps, he would have felt no interest, but only the brief\nqualm of pity that we dare not encourage in ourselves, on a journey so\nbeset with hopeless pitiful things as is the journey through life.\n\nBut he had no impulse to question her. And with some surprise he noted\nthat his reason for refraining was not the usual reason--unwillingness\nuselessly to add to one's own burdens by inviting the mournful\nconfidences of another. No, he checked himself because in the manner of\nthis frail and mouselike creature, dim though she once more was, there\nappeared a dignity, a reserve, that made intrusion curiously impossible.\nWith an apologetic note in his voice--a kind and friendly voice--he\nsaid:\n\n\"Please have your typewriter brought in here. I want you to do some work\nfor me--work that isn't to be spoken of--not even to Mr. Tetlow.\" He\nlooked at her with grave penetrating eyes. \"You will not speak of it?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she, and nothing more. But she accompanied the simple\nnegative with a clear and honest sincerity of the eyes that set his mind\ncompletely at rest. He felt that this girl had never in her life told a\nreal lie.\n\nOne of the office boys installed the typewriter, and presently Norman\nand the quiet nebulous girl at whom no one would trouble to look a\nsecond time were seated opposite each other with the broad table desk\nbetween, he leaning far back in his desk chair, fingers interlocked\nbehind his proud, strong-looking head, she holding sharpened pencil\nsuspended over the stenographic notebook. Long before she seated herself\nhe had forgotten her except as machine. There followed a troubled hour,\nas he dictated, ordered erasure, redictated, ordered re-readings,\nskipped back and forth, in the effort to frame the secret agreement in\nthe fewest and simplest, and least startlingly unlawful, words. At last\nhe leaned forward with the shine of triumph in his eyes.\n\n\"Read straight through,\" he commanded.\n\nShe read, interrupted occasionally by a sharp order from him to correct\nsome mistake in her notes.\n\n\"Again,\" he commanded, when she translated the last of her notes.\n\nThis time she was not interrupted once. When she ended, he exclaimed:\n\"Good! I don't see how you did it so well.\"\n\n\"Nor do I,\" said she.\n\n\"You say you are only a beginner.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have done it so well for anyone else,\" said she. \"You\nare--different.\"\n\nThe remark was worded most flatteringly, but it did not sound so. He saw\nthat she did not herself understand what she meant by \"different.\" _He_\nunderstood, for he knew the difference between the confused and\nconfusing ordinary minds and such an intelligence as his own--simple,\nluminous, enlightening all minds, however dark, so long as they were in\nthe light-flooded region around it.\n\n\"Have I made the meaning clear?\" he asked.\n\nHe hoped she would reply that he had not, though this would have\nindicated a partial defeat in the object he had--to put the complex\nthing so plainly that no one could fail to understand. But she answered,\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe congratulated himself that his overestimate of her ignorance of\naffairs had not lured him into giving her the names of the parties at\ninterest to transcribe. But did she really understand? To test her, he\nsaid:\n\n\"What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"That it's wicked,\" replied she, without hesitation and in her small,\nquiet voice.\n\nHe laughed. In a way this girl, sitting there--this inconsequential and\nnegligible atom--typefied the masses of mankind against whom that secret\nagreement was directed. They, the feeble and powerless ones, with their\nnecks ever bent under the yoke of the mighty and their feet ever\nstumbling into the traps of the crafty--they, too, would utter an\nimpotent \"Wicked!\" if they knew. His voice had the note of gentle\nraillery in it as he said:\n\n\"No--not wicked. Just business.\"\n\nShe was looking down at her book, her face expressionless. A few moments\nbefore he would have said it was an empty face. Now it seemed to him\nsphynxlike.\n\n\"Just business,\" he repeated. \"It is going to take money from those who\ndon't know how to keep or to spend it and give it to those who do know\nhow. The money will go for building up civilization, instead of for beer\nand for bargain-trough finery to make working men's wives and daughters\nlook cheap and nasty.\"\n\nShe was silent.\n\n\"Now, do you understand?\"\n\n\"I understand what you said.\" She looked at him as she spoke. He\nwondered how he could have fancied those lack-luster eyes beautiful or\ncapable of expression.\n\n\"You don't believe it?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" said she. And suddenly in those eyes, gazing now into space, there\ncame the unutterably melancholy look--heavy-lidded from heartache,\nweary-wise from long, long and bitter, experiences. Yet she still looked\nyoung--girlishly young--but it was the youthful look the classic Greek\nsculptors tried to give their young goddesses--the youth without\nbeginning or end--younger than a baby's, older than the oldest of the\nsons of men. He mocked himself for the fancies this queer creature\ninspired in him; but she none the less made him uneasy.\n\n\"You don't believe it?\" he repeated.\n\n\"No,\" she answered again. \"My father has taught me--some things.\"\n\nHe drummed impatiently on the table. He resented her impertinence--for,\nlike all men of clear and positive mind, he regarded contradiction as in\none aspect impudent, in another aspect evidence of the folly of his\ncontradictor. Then he gave a short laugh--the confessing laugh of the\nclever man who has tried to believe his own sophistries and has failed.\n\"Well--neither do I believe it,\" said he. \"Now, to get the thing\ntypewritten.\"\n\nShe seated herself at the machine and set to work. As his mind was full\nof the agreement he could not concentrate on anything else. From time to\ntime he glanced at her. Then he gave up trying to work and sat furtively\nobserving her. What a quaint little mystery it was! There was in\nit--that is, in her--not the least charm for him. But, in all his\nexperience with women, he could recall no woman with a comparable\ndevelopment of this curious quality of multiple personalities, showing\nand vanishing in swift succession.\n\nThere had been a time when woman had interested him as a puzzle to be\nworked out, a maze to be explored, a temple to be penetrated--until one\nreached the place where the priests manipulated the machinery for the\nwonders and miracles to fool the devotees into awe. Some men never get\nto this stage, never realize that their own passions, working upon the\nuniversal human love of the mysterious, are wholly responsible for the\ncult of woman the sphynx and the sibyl. But Norman, beloved of women,\nhad been let by them into their ultimate secret--the simple humanness of\nwoman; the clap-trappery of the oracles, miracles, and wonders. He had\ndiscovered that her \"divine intuitions\" were mere shrewd guesses, where\nthey had any meaning at all; that her eloquent silences were screens for\nignorance or boredom--and so on through the list of legends that prop\nthe feminist cult.\n\nBut this girl--this Miss Hallowell--here was a tangible mystery--a\nmystery of physics, of chemistry. He sat watching her--watching the\nchanges as she bent to her work, or relaxed, or puzzled over the meaning\nof one of her own hesitating stenographic hieroglyphics--watched her as\nthe waning light of the afternoon varied its intensity upon her skin.\nWhy, her very hair partook of this magical quality and altered its tint,\nits degree of vitality even, in harmony with the other changes. . . . What\nwas the explanation? By means of what rare mechanism did her nerve force\nebb and flow from moment to moment, bringing about these fascinating\nsurface changes in her body? Could anything, even any skin, be better\nmade than that superb skin of hers--that master work of delicacy and\nstrength, of smoothness and color? How had it been possible for him to\nfail to notice it, when he was always looking for signs of a good skin\ndown town--and up town, too--in these days of the ravages of pastry and\ncandy? . . . What long graceful fingers she had--yet what small hands!\nCertainly here was a peculiarity that persisted. No--absurd though it\nseemed, no! One way he looked at those hands, they were broad and\nstrong, another way narrow and gracefully weak.\n\nHe said to himself: \"The man who gets that girl will have Solomon's\nwives rolled into one. A harem at the price of a wife--or a--\" He left\nthe thought unfinished. It seemed an insult to this helpless little\ncreature, the more rather than the less cowardly for being unspoken;\nfor, no doubt her ideas of propriety were firmly conventional.\n\n\"About done?\" he asked impatiently.\n\nShe glanced up. \"In a moment. I'm sorry to be so slow.\"\n\n\"You're not,\" he assured her truthfully. \"It's my impatience. Let me see\nthe pages you've finished.\"\n\nWith them he was able to concentrate his mind. When she laid the last\npage beside his arm he was absorbed, did not look at her, did not think\nof her. \"Take the machine away,\" said he abruptly.\n\nHe was leaving for the day when he remembered her again. He sent for\nher. \"I forgot to thank you. It was good work. You will do well. All you\nneed is practice--and confidence. Especially confidence.\" He looked at\nher. She seemed frail--touchingly frail. \"You are not strong?\"\n\nShe smiled, and in an instant the frailty seemed to have been mere\ndelicacy of build--the delicacy that goes with the strength of steel\nwires, or rather of the spider's weaving thread which sustains weights\nand shocks out of all proportion to its appearance. \"I've never been ill\nin my life,\" said she. \"Not a day.\"\n\nAgain, because she was standing before him in full view, he noted the\npeculiar construction of her frame--the beautiful lines of length so\ndextrously combined that her figure as a whole was not tall. He said, \"A\nworking woman--or man--needs health above all. Thank you again.\" And he\nnodded a somewhat curt dismissal. When she glided away and he was alone\nbehind the closed door, he reflected for a moment upon the extraordinary\namount of thinking--and the extraordinary kind of thinking--into which\nthis poor little typewriter girl had beguiled him. He soon found the\nexplanation for this vagary into a realm so foreign to a man of his high\ntastes and ambitions. \"It's because I'm so in love with Josephine,\" he\ndecided. \"I've fallen into the sentimental state of all lovers. The\nwhole sex becomes novel and interesting and worth while.\"\n\nAs he left the office, unusually late, he saw her still at work--no\ndoubt doing over again some bungled piece of copying. She had her normal\nand natural look and air--the atomic little typewriter, unattractive and\nuninteresting. With another smile for his romantic imaginings, he forgot\nher. But when he reached the street he remembered her again. The\nthreatened blizzard had changed into a heavy rain. The swift and sudden\ncurrents of air, that have made of New York a cave of the winds since\nthe coming of the skyscrapers, were darting round corners, turning\numbrellas inside out, tossing women's skirts about their heads, reducing\nall who were abroad to the same level of drenched and sullen\nwretchedness. Norman's limousine was waiting at the curb. He, pausing in\nthe doorway, glanced up and down the street, had an impulse to return\nand take the girl home. Then he smiled satirically at himself. Her lot\ncondemned her to be out in all weathers. It would not be a kindness but\nan exhibition of smug vanity to shelter her this one night; also, there\nwas the question of her reputation--and the possibility of turning her\nhead, perhaps just enough to cause her ruin. He sprang across the\nwind-swept, rain-swept sidewalk and into the limousine whose door was\nbeing held open by an obsequious attendant. \"Home,\" he said, and the\ndoor slammed.\n\nUsually these journeys between office and home or club in the evening\ngave Norman a chance for ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. He had\ndiscovered that this brief dropping of the thread of consciousness gave\nhim a wonderful fresh grip upon the day, enabled him to work or play\nuntil late into the night without fatigue. But that evening his mind was\nwide awake. Nor could he fix it upon business. It would interest itself\nonly in the hurrying throngs of foot passengers and the ideas they\nsuggested: Here am I--so ran his thoughts--here am I, tucked away\ncomfortably while all those poor creatures have to plod along in the\nstorm. I could afford to be sick. They can't. And what have I done to\ndeserve this good fortune? Nothing. Worse than nothing. If I had made my\ncareer along the lines of what is honest and right and beneficial to my\nfellow men, I'd probably be plugging home under an umbrella--and to a\npretty poor excuse for a home. But I was too wise to do that. I've spent\nthis day, as I spend all my days, in helping the powerful rich to add to\ntheir wealth and power, to add to the burdens those poor devils out\nthere in the rain must bear. And I'm rewarded with a limousine, and all\nthe rest of it.\n\nThese thoughts neither came from nor produced a mood of penitence, or of\nregret even. Norman was simply indulging in his favorite\npastime--following without prejudice the leading of a chain of pure\nlogic. He despised self-deceivers. He always kept himself free from\nprejudice and all its wiles. He took life as he found it; but he did not\nexcuse it and himself with the familiar hypocrisies that make the\ncomfortable classes preen themselves on being the guardians and saviours\nof the ignorant, incapable masses. When old Lockyer said one day that\nthis was the function of the \"upper classes,\" Norman retorted: \"Perhaps.\nBut, if so, how do they perform it? Like the brutal old-fashioned farm\nfamily that takes care of its insane member by keeping him chained in\nfilth in the cellar.\" And once at the Federal Club--By the way, Norman\nhad joined it, had compelled it to receive him just to show his\nassociates how a strong man could break even such a firmly established\ntradition as that no one who amounted to anything could be elected to a\nfashionable club in New York. Once at the Federal Club old Galloway\nquoted with approval some essayist's remark that every clever human\nbeing was looking after and holding above the waves at least fifteen of\nhis weaker fellows. Norman smiled satirically round at the complacently\nnodding circle of gray heads and white heads. \"My observation has been,\"\nsaid he, \"that every clever chap is shrewd enough to compel at least\nfifteen of his fellows to wait on him, to take care of him--do his\nchores--and his dirty work.\" The nodding stopped. Scowls appeared,\nexcept on the face of old Galloway. He grinned. He was one of the few\nexamples of a very rich man with a sense of humor. Norman always thought\nit was this slight incident that led to his getting the extremely\nprofitable--and shady--Galloway business.\n\nNo, Norman's mood, as he watched the miserable crowds afoot and\nreflected upon them, was neither remorseful nor triumphant. He simply\nnoted an interesting fact--a commonplace fact--of the methods of that\nsardonic practical joker, Life. Because the scheme of things was unjust\nand stupid, because others, most others, were uncomfortable or\nworse--why should he make himself uncomfortable? It would be an\nabsurdity to get out of his limousine and trudge along in the wet and\nthe wind. It would be equally absurd to sit in his limousine and be\nunhappy about the misery of the world. \"I didn't create it, and I can't\nrecreate it. And if I'm helping to make it worse, I'm also hastening the\ntime when it'll be better. The Great Ass must have brains and spirit\nkicked and cudgeled into it.\"\n\nAt his house in Madison Avenue, just at the crest of Murray Hill, there\nwas an awning from front door to curb and a carpet beneath it. He\npassed, dry and comfortable, up the steps. A footman in quiet rich\nlivery was waiting to receive him. From rising until bedtime, up town\nand down town, wherever he went and whatever he was about, every\npossible menial detail of his life was done for him. He had nothing to\ndo but think about his own work and keep himself in health. Rarely did\nhe have even to open or to close a door. He used a pen only in signing\nhis name or marking a passage in a law book for some secretary to make a\ntypewritten copy.\n\nUpon most human beings this sort of luxury, carried beyond the ordinary\nand familiar uses of menial service, has a speedily enervating effect.\nThinking being the most onerous of all, they have it done, also. They\nsink into silliness and moral and mental sloth. They pass the time at\nfoolish purposeless games indoors and out; or they wander aimlessly\nabout the earth chattering with similar mental decrepits, much like\nmonkeys adrift in the boughs of a tropical forest. But Norman had the\ntenacity and strength to concentrate upon achievement all the powers\nemancipated by the use of menials wherever menials could be used. He\nemployed to advantage the time saved in putting in shirt buttons and\nlacing shoes and carrying books to and from shelves. In this lay one of\nthe important secrets of his success. \"Never do for yourself what you\ncan get some one else to do for you as well. Save yourself for the\nthings only _you_ can do.\"\n\nIn his household there were three persons, and sixteen servants to wait\nupon them. His sister--she and her husband, Clayton Fitzhugh, were the\nother two persons--his sister was always complaining that there were not\nenough servants, and Frederick, the most indulgent of brothers, was\nalways letting her add to the number. It seemed to him that the more\nhelp there was, the less smoothly the household ran. But that did not\nconcern him; his mind was saved for more important matters. There was no\nreason why it should concern him; could he not compel the dollars to\nflood in faster than she could bail them out?\n\nThis brother and sister had come to New York fifteen years before, when\nhe was twenty-two and she nineteen. They were from Albany, where their\nfamily had possessed some wealth and much social position for many\ngenerations. There was the usual \"queer streak\" in the Norman family--an\nintermittent but fixed habit of some one of them making a \"low\nmarriage.\" One view of this aberration might have been that there was in\nthe Norman blood a tenacious instinct of sturdy and self-respecting\nindependence that caused a Norman occasionally to do as he pleased\ninstead of as he conventionally ought. Each time the thing occurred\nthere was a mighty and horrified hubbub throughout the connection. But\nin the broad, as the custom is, the Normans were complacent about the\n\"queer streak.\" They thought it kept the family from rotting out and\nrunning to seed. \"Nothing like an occasional infusion of common blood,\"\nAunt Ursula Van Bruyten (born Norman) used to say. For her Norman's\nsister was named.\n\nNorman's father had developed the \"queer streak.\" Their mother was the\ndaughter of a small farmer and, when she met their father, was\nchambermaid in a Troy hotel, Troy then being a largish village. As soon\nas she found herself married and in a position with whose duties she was\nunfamiliar, she set about fitting herself for them with the same\ndiligence and thoroughness which she had shown in learning chamber work\nin a village hotel. She educated herself, selected not without\nshrewdness and carefully put on an assortment of genteel airs, finally\ncontrived to make a most creditable appearance--was more aristocratic in\ntastes and in talk than the high mightiest of her relatives by marriage.\nBut her son Fred was a Pinkey in character. In boyhood he was noted for\nhis rough and low associates. His bosom friends were the son of a Jewish\njunk dealer, the son of a colored wash-woman, and the son of an Irish\nday laborer. Also, the commonness persisted as he grew up. Instead of\nseeking aristocratic ease, he aspired to a career. He had choice of\nseveral rich and well-born girls; but he developed a strong distaste for\nmarriage of any sort and especially for a rich marriage. A fortune he\nwas resolved to have, but it should be one that belonged to him. When he\nwas about ready to enter a law office, his father and mother died\nleaving less than ten thousand dollars in all for his sister and\nhimself. His sister hesitated, half inclined to marry a stupid second\ncousin who had thirty thousand a year.\n\n\"Don't do it, Ursula,\" Fred advised. \"If you must sell out, sell for\nsomething worth while.\" He laughed in his frank, ironical way. \"Fact is,\nwe've both made up our minds to sell. Let's go to the best market--New\nYork. If you don't like it, you can come back and marry that fat-wit any\ntime you please.\"\n\nUrsula inspected herself in the glass, saw a face and form exceeding\nfair to look upon; she decided to take her brother's advice. At twenty\nshe threw over a multi-millionaire and married Clayton Fitzhugh for\nlove--Clayton with only seventeen thousand a year. Of course, from the\nstandpoint of fashionable ambition, seventeen thousand a year in New\nYork is but one remove from tenement house poverty. As Clayton had no\nmore ability at making money than had Ursula herself, there was nothing\nto do but live with Norman and \"take care of him.\" But for this\nself-sacrifice of sisterly affection Norman would have been rich at\nthirty-seven. As he had to make her rich as well as himself, progress\ntoward luxurious independence was slower--and there was the house,\ncosting nearly fifty thousand a year to keep up.\n\nThere had been a time in Norman's career--a brief and very early\ntime--when, with the maternal peasant blood hot in his veins, he had\nentertained the quixotic idea of going into politics on the poor or\npeople's side and fighting for glory only. The pressure of expensive\nliving had soon driven this notion clean off. Norman had almost\nforgotten that he ever had it, was no longer aware how strong it had\nbeen in the last year at law school. Young men of high intelligence and\nardent temperament always pass through this period. With some--a\nfew--its glory lingers long after the fire has flickered out before the\ncool, steady breath of worldliness.\n\nAll this time Norman has been dressing for dinner. He now leaves the\nthird floor and descends toward the library, as it still lacks twenty\nminutes of the dinner hour.\n\nAs he walked along the hall of the second floor a woman's voice called\nto him, \"That you, Fred?\"\n\nHe turned in at his sister's sitting room. She was standing at a table\nsmoking a cigarette. Her tall, slim figure looked even taller and\nslimmer in the tight-fitting black satin evening dress. Her features\nfaintly suggested her relationship to Norman. She was a handsome woman,\nwith a voluptuous discontented mouth.\n\n\"What are you worried about, sis?\" inquired he.\n\n\"How did you know I was worried?\" returned she.\n\n\"You always are.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"But you're unusually worried to-night.\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"You never smoke just before dinner unless your nerves are ragged. . . .\nWhat is it?\"\n\n\"Money.\"\n\n\"Of course. No one in New York worries about anything else.\"\n\n\"But _this_ is serious,\" protested she. \"I've been thinking--about your\nmarriage--and what'll become of Clayton and me?\" She halted, red with\nembarrassment.\n\nNorman lit a cigarette himself. \"I ought to have explained,\" said he.\n\"But I assumed you'd understand.\"\n\n\"Fred, you know Clayton can't make anything. And when you\nmarry--why--what _will_ become of us!\"\n\n\"I've been taking care of Clayton's money--and of yours. I'll continue\nto do it. I think you'll find you're not so badly of. You see, my\nposition enables me to compel a lot of the financiers to let me in on\nthe ground floor--and to warn me in good time before the house falls.\nYou'll not miss me, Ursula.\"\n\nShe showed her gratitude in her eyes, in a slight quiver of the lips, in\nan unsteadiness of tone as she said, \"You're the real thing, Freddie.\"\n\n\"You can go right on as you are now. Only--\" He was looking at her with\nmeaning directness.\n\nShe moved uneasily, refused to meet his gaze. \"Well?\" she said, with a\nsuggestion of defiance.\n\n\"It's all very natural to get tired of Clayton,\" said her brother. \"I\nknew you would when you married him. But--Sis, I mind my own business.\nStill--Why make a fool of yourself?\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she exclaimed passionately. And the light in her\neyes, the color in her cheeks, restored to her for the moment the beauty\nof her youth that was almost gone.\n\n\"Understand what?\" inquired he in a tone of gentle mockery.\n\n\"Love. You are all ambition--all self control. You can be\naffectionate--God knows, you have been to me, Fred. But love you know\nnothing about--nothing.\"\n\nHis was the smile a man gives when in earnest and wishing to be thought\njesting--or when in jest and wishing to be thought in earnest.\n\n\"You mean Josephine? Oh, yes, I suppose you do care for her in a way--in\na nice, conventional way. She is a fine handsome piece--just the sort to\nfill the position of wife to a man like you. She's sweet and charming,\nshe appreciates, she flatters you. I'm sure she loves you as much as a\n_girl_ knows how to love. But it's all so conventional, so proper. Your\nposition--her money. You two are of the regulation type even in that\nyou're suited to each other in height and figure. Everybody'll say,\n'What a fine couple--so well matched!'\"\n\n\"Maybe _you_ don't understand,\" said Norman.\n\n\"If Josephine were poor and low-born--weren't one of us--and all\nthat--would you have her?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" was his prompt and amused answer. \"I can only\nsay that I know what I want, she being what she is.\"\n\nUrsula shook her head. \"I have only to see you and her together to know\nthat you at least don't understand love.\"\n\n\"It might be well if _you_ didn't,\" said Norman dryly. \"You might be less\nunhappy--and Clayton less uneasy.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I can't help myself. Don't you see it in me, Fred? I'm not a\nfool. Yet see what a fool I act.\"\n\n\"Spoiled child--that's all. No self-control.\"\n\n\"You despise everyone who isn't as strong as you.\" She looked at him\nintently. \"I wonder if you _are_ as self-controlled as you imagine.\nSometimes I wish you'd get a lesson. Then you'd be more sympathetic. But\nit isn't likely you will--not through a woman. Oh, they're such\npitifully easy game for a man like you. But then men are the same way\nwith you--quite as easy. You get anything you want. . . . You're really\ngoing to stick to Josephine?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It's time for me to settle down.\"\n\n\"Yes--I think it is,\" she went on thoughtfully. \"I can hardly believe\nyou're to marry. Of course, she's the grand prize. Still--I never\nimagined you'd come in and surrender. I guess you _do_ care for her.\"\n\n\"Why else should I marry?\" argued he. \"She's got nothing I need--except\nherself, Ursula.\"\n\n\"What _is_ it you see in her?\"\n\n\"What you see--what everyone sees,\" replied Fred, with quiet, convincing\nenthusiasm. \"What no one could help seeing. As you say, she's the grand\nprize.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is sweet and handsome--and intelligent--very superior,\nwithout making others feel that they're outclassed. Still--there's\nsomething lacking--not in her perhaps, but in you. You have it for\nher--she's crazy about you. But she hasn't it for you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you. It isn't a thing that can be put into words.\"\n\n\"Then it doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes it does,\" cried Ursula. \"If the engagement were to be\nbroken--or if anything were to happen to her--why, you'd get over\nit--would go on as if nothing had happened. If she didn't fit in with\nyour plans and ambitions, she'd be sacrificed so quick she'd not know\nwhat had taken off her head. But if you felt what I mean--then you'd\ngive up everything--do the wildest, craziest things.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" scoffed Norman. \"I can imagine myself making a fool\nof myself about a woman as easily as about anything else. But I can't\nimagine myself playing the fool for anything whatsoever.\"\n\nThere was mysterious fire in Ursula's absent eyes. \"You remember me as a\ngirl--how mercenary I was--how near I came to marrying Cousin Jake?\"\n\n\"I saved you from that.\"\n\n\"Yes--and for what? I fell in love.\"\n\n\"And out again.\"\n\n\"I was deceived in Clayton--deceived myself--naturally. How is a woman\nto know, without experience?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not criticising,\" said the brother.\n\n\"Besides, a love marriage that fails is different from a mercenary\nmarriage that fails.\"\n\n\"Very--very,\" agreed he. \"Just the difference between an honorable and a\ndishonorable bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"Anyhow--it's bankrupt--my marriage. But I've learned what love is--that\nthere is such a thing--and that it's valuable. Yes, Fred, I've got the\ntaste for that wine--the habit of it. Could I go back to water or milk?\"\n\n\"Spoiled baby--that's the whole story. If you had a nursery full of\nchildren--or did the heavy housework--you'd never think of these\nfoolish moonshiny things.\"\n\n\"Yet you say you love!\"\n\n\"Clayton is as good as any you're likely to run across--is better than\n_some_ I've seen about.\"\n\n\"How can _you_ say?\" cried she. \"It's for me to judge.\"\n\n\"If you would only _judge_!\"\n\nUrsula sighed. \"It's useless to talk to you. Let's go down.\"\n\nNorman, following her from the room, stopped her in the doorway to give\nher a brotherly hug and kiss. \"You won't make an out-and-out idiot of\nyourself, will you, Ursula?\" he said, in his winning manner.\n\nThe expression of her eyes as she looked at him showed how strong was\nhis influence over her. \"You know I'll come to you for advice before I\ndo anything final,\" said she. \"Oh, I don't know what I want! I only know\nwhat I don't want. I wish I were well balanced--as you are, Fred.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'You won't make an out-and-out idiot of yourself, will\nyou Ursula?'\"]\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe brother and sister dined alone. Clayton was, finding his club a more\ncomfortable place than his home, in those days of his wife's\ndisillusionment and hesitation about the future. Many weak creatures are\ncuriously armed for the unequal conflict of existence--some with\nfleetness of foot, some with a pole-cat weapon of malignance, some with\nporcupine quills, some with a 'possumlike instinct for \"playing dead.\"\nOf these last was Fitzhugh. He knew when to be silent, when to keep out\nof the way, when to \"sit tight\" and wait. His wife had discovered that\nhe was a fool--that he perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other\nsingle factor for the success of his splendid pose of the thorough\ngentleman. Yet she did not realize what an utter fool he was, so clever\nhad he been in the use of the art of discreet silence. Norman suspected\nhim, but could not believe a human being capable of such fathomless\nvacuity as he found whenever he tried to explore his brother-in-law's\nbrain.\n\nAfter dinner Norman took Ursula to the opera, to join the Seldins, and\nafter the first act went to Josephine, who had come with only a deaf old\naunt. Josephine loved music, and to hear an opera from a box one must be\nalone. Norman entered as the lights went up. It always gave him a\nfeeling of dilation, this spectacle of material splendor--the women,\nwhose part it is throughout civilization to-day to wear for public\nadmiration and envy the evidences of the prowess of the males to whom\nthey belong. A truer version of Dr. Holmes's aphorism would be that it\ntakes several generations in oil to make a deep-dyed snob--wholly to\ndestroy a man's or a woman's point of view, sense of the kinship of all\nflesh, and to make him or her over into the genuine believer in caste\nand worshiper of it. For all his keenness of mind, of humor, Norman had\nthe fast-dyed snobbishness of his family and friends. He knew that caste\nwas silly, that such displays as this vulgar flaunting of jewels and\ncostly dresses were in atrocious bad taste. But it is one thing to know,\nanother thing to feel; and his feeling was delight in the spectacle,\npride in his own high rank in the aristocracy.\n\nHis eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl he was to marry. And\nshe was indeed a person to appeal to the passion of pride. Simply and\nmost expensively dressed in pearl satin, with only a little jewelry, she\nsat in the front of her parterre box, a queen by right of her father's\nwealth, her family's position, her own beauty. She was a large\nwoman--tall, a big frame but not ungainly. She had brilliant dark eyes,\na small proud head set upon shoulders that were slenderly young now and,\neven when they should became matronly, would still be beautiful. She had\ngood teeth, an exquisite smile, the gentle good humor of those who,\ncomfortable themselves, would not have the slightest objection to all\nothers being equally so. Because she laughed appreciatively and repeated\namusingly she had great reputation for wit. Because she industriously\npicked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk about politics,\nreligion, art and the like, she was renowned as clever verging on\nprofound. And she believed herself both witty and wise--as do thousands,\nmale and female, with far less excuse.\n\nShe had selected Norman for the same reason that he had selected her;\neach recognized the other as the \"grand prize.\" Pity is not nearly so\nclose kin to love as is the feeling that the other person satisfies to\nthe uttermost all one's pet vanities. It would have been next door to\nimpossible for two people so well matched not to find themselves drawn\nto each other and filled with sympathy and the sense of comradeship, so\nfar as there can be comradeship where two are driving luxuriously along\nthe way of life, with not a serious cause for worry. People without half\nthe general fitness of these two for each other have gone through to the\nend, regarding themselves and regarded as the most devoted of lovers.\nIndeed, they were lovers. Only one of those savage tests, to which in\nall probability they would never be exposed, would or could reveal just\nhow much, or how little, that vague, variable word lovers meant when\napplied to them.\n\nAs their eyes met, into each pair leaped the fine, exalted light of\npride in possession. \"This wonderful woman is mine!\" his eyes said. And\nher eyes answered, \"And you--you most wonderful of men--you are mine!\"\nIt always gave each of them a thrill like intoxication to meet, after a\nday's separation. All the joy of their dazzling good fortune burst upon\nthem afresh.\n\n\"I'll venture you haven't thought of me the whole day,\" said she as he\ndropped to the chair behind her.\n\nIt was a remark she often made--to give him the opportunity to say,\n\"I've thought of little else, I'm sorry to say--I, who have a career to\nlook after.\" He made the usual answer, and they smiled happily at each\nother. \"And you?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I? What else has a woman to think about?\"\n\nHer statement was as true as his was false. He was indeed all she had to\nthink about--all worth wasting the effort of thought upon. But\nhe--though he did not realize it--had thought of her only in the\nincidental way in which an ambition-possessed man must force himself to\nthink of a woman. The best of his mind was commandeered to his career.\nAn amiable but shakily founded theory that it was \"our\" career enabled\nhim to say without sense of lying that his chief thought had been she.\n\n\"How those men down town would poke fun at you,\" said she, \"if they knew\nyou had me with you all the time, right beside you.\"\n\nThis amused him. \"Still, I suspect there are lots of men who'd be\nexposed in the same way if there were a general and complete show-down.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I wish I really were with you--working with you--helping you.\nYou have girls--a girl--to be your secretary--or whatever you call\nit--don't you?\"\n\n\"You should have seen the one I had to-day. But there's always something\npathetic about every girl who has to make her own living.\"\n\n\"Pathetic!\" protested Miss Burroughs. \"Not at all. I think it's fine.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't say that if you had tried it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I should,\" she declared with spirit. \"You men are entirely too\nsoft about women. You don't realize how strong they are. And, of course,\nwomen don't resist the temptation to use their sex when they see how\neasy it is to fool men that way. The sad thing about it is that the\nwoman who gets along by using her sex and by appealing to the\nsoft-heartedness of men never learns to rely on herself. She's likely to\ncome to grief sooner or later.\"\n\n\"There's truth in all that,\" said Norman. \"Enough to make it dangerously\nunjust. There's so much lying done about getting on that it's no wonder\nthose who've never tried to do for themselves get a wholly false notion\nof the situation. It is hard--bitterly hard--for a man to get on. Most\nmen don't. Most men? All but a mere handful. And if those who do get on\nwere to tell the truth--the _whole_ truth--about how they\nsucceeded--well, it'd not make a pleasant story.\"\n\n\"But _you've_ got on,\" retorted the girl.\n\n\"So I have. And how?\" Norman smiled with humorous cynicism. \"I'll never\ntell--not all--only the parts that sound well. And those parts are the\nleast important. However, let's not talk about that. What I set out to\nsay was that, while it's hard for a man to make a decent living--unless\nhe has luck--and harder still--much harder--for him to rise to\nindependence----\"\n\n\"It wasn't so dreadfully hard for _you_,\" interrupted Josephine, looking\nat him with proud admiration. \"But then, you had a wonderful brain.\"\n\n\"That wasn't what did it,\" replied he. \"And, in spite of all my\nadvantages--friendships, education, enough money to tide me over the\nbeginnings--in spite of all that, I had a frightful time. Not the work.\nOf course, I had to work, but I like that. No, it was the--the\nmaneuvering, let's call it--the hardening process.\"\n\n\"You!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Everyone who succeeds--in active life. You don't understand the system,\ndear. It's a cutthroat game. It isn't at all what the successful\nhypocrites describe in their talks to young men!\" He laughed. \"If I had\nfollowed the 'guides to success,' I'd not be here. Oh, yes, I've made\nterrible sacrifices, but--\" his look at her made her thrill with\nexaltation--\"it was worth doing. . . . I understand and sympathize with\nthose who scorn to succeed. But I'm glad I happened not to be born with\ntheir temperament, at least not with enough of it to keep me down.\"\n\n\"You're too hard on yourself, too generous to the failures.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean the men who were too lazy to do the work or too\ncowardly to dare the--the unpleasant things. And I'm not hard with\nmyself--only frank. But we were talking of the women. Poor things, what\nchance have they got? You scorn them for using their sex. Wait till\nyou're drowning, dear, before you criticise another for what he does to\nsave himself when he's sinking for the last time. I used everything I\nhad in making my fight. If I could have got on better or quicker by the\naid of my sex, I'd have used that.\"\n\n\"Don't say those things, Fred,\" cried Josephine, smiling but half in\nearnest.\n\n\"Why not? Aren't you glad I'm here?\"\n\nShe gave him a long look of passionate love and lowered her eyes.\n\n\"At whatever cost?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said in a low voice. \"But I'm _sure_ you exaggerate.\"\n\n\"I've done nothing _you_ wouldn't approve of--or find excuses for. But\nthat's because you--I--all of us in this class--and in most other\nclasses--have been trained to false ideas--no, to perverted ideas--to a\nsystem of morality that's twisted to suit the demands of practical life.\nOn Sundays we go to a magnificent church to hear an expensive preacher\nand choir, go in expensive dress and in carriages, and we never laugh at\nourselves. Yet we are going in the name of One who was born in a stable\nand who said that we must give everything to the poor, and so on.\"\n\n\"But I don't see what we could do about it--\" she said hesitatingly.\n\n\"We couldn't do anything. Only--don't you see my point?--the difference\nbetween theory and practice? Personally, I've no objection--no strong\nobjection--to the practice. All I object to is the lying and faking\nabout it, to make it seem to fit the theory. But we were talking of\nwomen--women who work.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt you're right,\" admitted she. \"I suppose they aren't to\nblame for using their sex. I ought to be ashamed of myself, to sneer at\nthem.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, their sex does few of them any good. The reverse.\nYou see, an attractive woman--one who's attractive _as_ a woman--can\nskirmish round and find some one to support her. But most of the working\nwomen--those who keep on at it--don't find the man. They're not\nattractive, not even at the start. After they've been at it a few years\nand lose the little bloom they ever had--why, they've got to take their\nchances at the game, precisely like a man. Only, they're handicapped by\nalways hoping that they'll be able to quit and become married women. I'd\nlike to see how men would behave if they could find or could imagine any\nalternative to 'root hog or die.'\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you this evening, Fred? I never saw you in such\na bitter mood.\"\n\n\"We never happened to get on this subject before.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we have. And you always have scoffed at the men who fail.\"\n\n\"And I still scoff at them--most of them. A lot of lazy cowards. Or\nelse, so bent on self-indulgence--petty self-indulgence--that they\nrefuse to make the small sacrifice to-day for the sake of the large\nadvantage day after to-morrow. Or else so stuffed with vanity that they\nnever see their own mistakes. However, why blame them? They were born\nthat way, and can't change. A man who has the equipment of success and\nsucceeds has no more right to sneer at one less lucky than you would\nhave to laugh at a poor girl because she wasn't dressed as well as you.\"\n\n\"What a mood! _Something_ must have happened.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said he reflectively. \"Possibly that girl set me off.\"\n\n\"What girl?\"\n\n\"The one I told you about. The unfortunate little creature who was\ntypewriting for me this afternoon. Not so very little, either. A curious\nfigure she had. She was tall yet she wasn't. She seemed thin, and when\nyou looked again, you saw that she was really only slender, and\nbeautifully shaped throughout.\"\n\nMiss Burroughs laughed. \"She must have been attractive.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Absolutely without charm--and so homely--no, not\nhomely--commonplace. No, that's not right, either. She had a startling\nway of fading and blazing out. One moment she seemed a blank--pale,\nlifeless, colorless, a nobody. The next minute she became--amazingly\ndifferent. Not the same thing every time, but different things.\"\n\nFrederick Norman was too experienced a dealer with women deliberately to\nmake the mistake--rather, to commit the breach of tact and\ncourtesy--involved in praising one woman to another. But in this case it\nnever occurred to him that he was talking to a woman of a woman.\nJosephine Burroughs was a lady; the other was a piece of office\nmachinery--and a very trivial piece at that. But he saw and instantly\nunderstood the look in her eyes--the strained effort to keep the\ntelltale upper lip from giving its prompt and irrepressible signal of\ninward agitation.\n\n\"I'm very much interested,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, she was a curiosity,\" said he carelessly.\n\n\"Has she been there--long?\" inquired Josephine, with a feigned\nindifference that did not deceive him.\n\n\"Several months, I believe. I never noticed her until a few days ago.\nAnd until to-day I had forgotten her. She's one of the kind it's\ndifficult to remember.\"\n\nHe fell to glancing round the house, pretending to be unconscious of the\nfurtive suspicion with which she was observing him. She said:\n\n\"She's your secretary now?\"\n\n\"Merely a general office typewriter.\"\n\nThe curtain went up for the second act. Josephine fixed her attention on\nthe stage--apparently undivided attention. But Norman felt rather than\nsaw that she was still worrying about the \"curiosity.\" He marveled at\nthis outcropping of jealousy. It seemed ridiculous--it _was_ ridiculous.\nHe laughed to himself. If she could see the girl--the obscure,\nuninteresting cause of her agitation--how she would mock at herself!\nThen, too, there was the absurdity of thinking him capable of such a\nstoop. A woman of their own class--or a woman of its corresponding\nclass, on the other side of the line--yes. No doubt she had heard\nthings that made her uneasy, or, at least, ready to be uneasy. But this\npoorly dressed obscurity, with not a charm that could attract even a man\nof her own lowly class--It was such a good joke that he would have\nteased Josephine about it but for his knowledge of the world--a\nknowledge in whose primer it was taught that teasing is both bad taste\nand bad judgment. Also, it was beneath his dignity, it was offense to\nhis vanity, to couple his name with the name of one so beneath him that\neven the matter of sex did not make the coupling less intolerable.\n\nWhen the curtain fell several people came into the box, and he went to\nmake a few calls round the parterre. He returned after the second act.\nThey were again alone--the deaf old aunt did not count. At once\nJosephine began upon the same subject. With studied indifference--how\namusing for a woman of her inexperience to try to fool a man of his\nexperience!--she said:\n\n\"Tell me some more about that typewriter girl. Women who work always\ninterest me.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't,\" said Norman. The subject had been driven clean out of\nhis mind, and he didn't wish to return to it. \"Some day they will\nventure to make judicious long cuts in Wagner's operas, and then they'll\nbe interesting. It always amuses me, this reverence of little people for\nthe great ones--as if a great man were always great. No--he _is_ always\ngreat. But often it's in a dull way. And the dull parts ought to be\nskipped.\"\n\n\"I don't like the opera this evening,\" said she. \"What you said a while\nago has set me to thinking. Is that girl a lady?\"\n\n\"She works,\" laughed he.\n\n\"But she might have been a lady.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't you know _anything_ about her?\"\n\n\"Except that she's trustworthy--and insignificant and not too good at\nher business.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think you could afford to keep incompetent people,\" said\nthe girl shrewdly.\n\n\"Perhaps they won't keep her,\" parried Norman gracefully. \"The head\nclerk looks after those things.\"\n\n\"He probably likes her.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Norman, too indifferent to be cautious. \"She has no\n'gentlemen friends.'\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" said the girl, and she could not keep a certain\nsharpness out of her voice.\n\n\"Tetlow, the head clerk, told me. I asked him a few questions about her.\nI had some confidential work to do and didn't want to trust her without\nbeing sure.\"\n\nHe saw that she was now prey to her jealous suspicion. He was uncertain\nwhether to be amused or irritated. She had to pause long and with\nvisible effort collect herself before venturing:\n\n\"Oh, she does confidential work for you? I thought you said she was\nincompetent.\"\n\nHe, the expert cross-examiner, had to admire her skill at that high\nscience and art. \"I felt sorry for her,\" he said. \"She seemed such a\nforlorn little creature.\"\n\nShe laughed with a constrained attempt at raillery. \"I never should have\nsuspected you of such weakness. To give confidential things to a forlorn\nlittle incompetent, out of pity.\"\n\nHe was irritated, distinctly. The whole thing was preposterous. It\nreminded him of feats of his own before a jury. By clever questioning,\nJosephine had made about as trifling an incident as could be imagined\ntake on really quite imposing proportions. There was annoyance in his\nsmile as he said:\n\n\"Shall I send her up to see you? You might find it amusing, and maybe\nyou could do something for her.\"\n\nJosephine debated. \"Yes,\" she finally said. \"I wish you would send\nher--\" with a little sarcasm--\"if you can spare her for an hour or so.\"\n\n\"Don't make it longer than that,\" laughed he. \"Everything will stop\nwhile she's gone.\"\n\nIt pleased him, in a way, this discovery that Josephine had such a\ncommon, commonplace weakness as jealousy. But it also took away\nsomething from his high esteem for her--an esteem born of the lover's\nidealizings; for, while he was not of the kind of men who are on their\nknees before women, he did have a deep respect for Josephine,\nincarnation of all the material things that dazzled him--a respect with\nsomething of the reverential in it, and something of awe--more than he\nwould have admitted to himself. To-day, as of old, the image-makers are\nas sincere worshipers as visit the shrines. In our prostrations and\ngenuflections in the temple we do not discriminate against the idols we\nourselves have manufactured; on the contrary, them we worship with\npeculiar gusto. Norman knew his gods were frauds, that their divine\nqualities were of the earth earthy. But he served them, and what most\nappealed to him in Josephine was that she incorporated about all their\ndivine qualities.\n\nHe and his sister went home together. Her first remark in the auto was:\n\"What were you and Josie quarreling about?\"\n\n\"Quarreling?\" inquired he in honest surprise.\n\n\"I looked at her through my glasses and saw that the was all upset--and\nyou, too.\"\n\n\"This is too ridiculous,\" cried he.\n\n\"She looked--jealous.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! What an imagination you have!\"\n\n\"I saw what I saw,\" Ursula maintained. \"Well, I suppose she has heard\nsomething--something recent. I thought you had sworn off, Fred. But I\nmight have known.\"\n\nNorman was angry. He wondered at his own exasperation, out of all\nproportion to any apparent provoking cause. And it was most unusual for\nhim to feel temper, all but unprecedented for him to show it, no matter\nhow strong the temptation.\n\n\"It's a good idea, to make her jealous,\" pursued his sister. \"Nothing\nlike jealousy to stimulate interest.\"\n\n\"Josephine is not that sort of woman.\"\n\n\"You know better. All women are that sort. All men, too. Of course, some\nmen and women grow angry and go away when they get jealous while others\nstick closer. So one has to be judicious.\"\n\n\"Josephine and I understand each other far too well for such pettiness.\"\n\n\"Try her. No, you needn't. You have.\"\n\n\"Didn't I tell you----\"\n\n\"Then what was she questioning you about?\"\n\n\"Just to show you how wrong you were, I'll tell you. She was asking me\nabout a poor little girl down at the office--one she wants to help.\"\n\nUrsula laughed. \"To help out of your office, I guess. I thought you'd\nlived long enough, Fred, to learn that no woman trusts _any_ man about\n_any_ woman. Who is this 'poor little girl'?\"\n\n\"I don't even know her name. One of the typewriters.\"\n\n\"What made Josephine jealous of her?\"\n\n\"Haven't I told you Josephine was not----\"\n\n\"But I saw. Who is this girl?--pretty?\"\n\nNorman pretended to stifle a yawn. \"Josephine bored me half to death\ntalking about her. Now it's you. I never heard so much about so little.\"\n\n\"Is there something up between you and the girl?\" teased Ursula.\n\n\"Now, that's an outrage!\" cried Norman. \"She's got nothing but her\nreputation, poor child. Do leave her that.\"\n\n\"Is she very young?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"Youth is a charm in itself.\"\n\n\"What sort of rot is this!\" exclaimed he. \"Do you think I'd drop down to\nanything of that kind--in _any_ circumstances? A little working girl--and\nin my own office?\"\n\n\"Why do you heat so, Fred?\" teased the sister. \"Really, I don't wonder\nJosephine was torn up.\"\n\nAn auto almost ran into them--one of those innumerable hairbreadth\nescapes that make the streets of New York as exciting as a battle--and\nas dangerous. For a few minutes Ursula's mind was deflected. But a\nfatality seemed to pursue the subject of the pale obscurity whose very\nname he was uncertain whether he remembered aright.\n\nSaid Ursula, as they entered the house, \"A girl working in the office\nwith a man has a magnificent chance at him. It's lucky for the men that\nwomen don't know their business, but are amateurs and too stuck on\nthemselves to set and bait their traps properly. Is that girl trying to\nget round you?\"\n\n\"What possesses everybody to-night!\" cried Norman. \"I tell you the\ngirl's as uninteresting a specimen as you could find.\"\n\n\"Then why are _you_ so interested in her?\" teased the sister.\n\nNorman shrugged his shoulders, laughed with his normal easy good humor\nand went to his own floor.\n\nOn top of the pile of letters beside his plate, next morning, lay a note\nfrom Josephine:\n\n  \"Don't forget your promise about that girl, dear. I've an hour before\n  lunch, and could see her then. I was out of humor last night. I'm very\n  penitent this morning. Please forgive me. Maybe I can do something for\n  her. JOSEPHINE.\"\n\n\nNorman read with amused eyes. \"Well!\" soliloquized he, \"I'm not likely\nto forget that poor little creature again. What a fuss about nothing!\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMany men, possibly a majority, have sufficient equipment for at least a\nfair measure of success. Yet all but a few are downright failures,\npassing their lives in helpless dependence, glad to sell themselves for\na small part of the value they create. For this there are two main\nreasons. The first is, as Norman said, that only a few men have the\nself-restraint to resist the temptings of a small pleasure to-day in\norder to gain a larger to-morrow or next day. The second is that few men\npossess the power of continuous concentration. Most of us cannot\nconcentrate at all; any slight distraction suffices to disrupt and\ndestroy the whole train of thought. A good many can concentrate for a\nfew hours, for a week or so, for two or three months. But there comes a\nsmall achievement and it satisfies, or a small discouragement and it\ndisheartens. Only to the rare few is given the power to concentrate\nsteadily, year in and year out, through good and evil event or report.\n\nAs Norman stepped into his auto to go to the office--he had ridden a\nhorse in the park before breakfast until its hide was streaked with\nlather--the instant he entered his auto, he discharged his mind of\neverything but the business before him down town--or, rather, business\nfilled his mind so completely that everything else poured out and away.\nA really fine mind--a perfect or approximately perfect instrument to the\npurposes of its possessor--is a marvelous spectacle of order. It is like\na vast public library constantly used by large numbers. There are\nalcoves, rows on rows, shelves on shelves, with the exactest system\neverywhere prevailing, with the attendants moving about in list-bottomed\nshoes, fulfilling without the least hesitation or mistake the multitude\nof directions from the central desk. It is like an admirably drilled\narmy, where there is the nice balance of freedom and discipline that\ngives mobility without confusion; the divisions, down to files and even\nunits, can be disposed along the line of battle wherever needed, or can\nbe marshaled in reserve for use at the proper moment. Such a mind may be\nused for good purpose or bad--or for mixed purposes, after the usual\nfashion in human action. But whatever the service to which it is put, it\nacts with equal energy and precision. Character--that is a thing apart.\nThe character determines the morality of action; but only the intellect\ndetermines the skill of action.\n\nIn the offices of that great law firm one of the keenest pleasures of\nthe more intelligent of the staff was watching the workings of Frederick\nNorman's mind--its ease of movement, its quickness and accuracy, its\nobedience to the code of mental habits he had fixed for himself. In\nlarge part all this was born with the man; but it had been brought to a\nstate of perfection by the most painful labor, by the severest\ndiscipline, by years of practice of the sacrifice of small\ntemptations--temptations to waste time and strength on the little\npleasant things which result in such heavy bills--bills that bankrupt a\nman in middle life and send him in old age into the deserts of poverty\nand contempt.\n\nSuch an unique and trivial request as that of Josephine Burroughs being\nwholly out of his mental habit for down town, he forgot it along with\neverything else having to do with uptown only--along with Josephine\nherself, to tell a truth which may pique the woman reader and may be\nwholly misunderstood by the sentimentalists. By merest accident he was\nreminded.\n\nAs the door of his private office opened to admit an important client he\nhappened to glance up. And between the edge of the door frame and his\nclient's automobile-fattened and carefully dressed body, he caught a\nglimpse of the \"poor little forlornness\" who chanced to be crossing the\nouter office. A glint of sunlight on her hair changed it from\nlifelessness to golden vital vividness; the same chance sunbeam touched\nher pale skin with a soft yellow radiation--and her profile was\ndelicately fine and regular. Thus Norman, who observed everything, saw\na head of finely wrought gold--a startling cameo against the dead white\nof office wall. It was only with the second thought that he recognized\nher. The episode of the night before came back and Josephine's penitent\nyet persistent note.\n\nHe glanced at the clock. Said the client in the amusing tone of one who\nwould like to take offense if he only dared, \"I'll not detain you long,\nMr. Norman. And really the matter is extremely important.\"\n\nThere are not many lawyers, even of the first rank, with whom their big\nclients reverse the attitude of servant and master. Norman might well\nhave been flattered. In that restrained tone from one used to servility\nand fond of it and easily miffed by lack of it was the whole story of\nNorman's long battle and splendid victory. But he was not in the mood to\nbe flattered; he was thinking of other things. And it presently annoyed\nhim that his usually docile mind refused to obey his will's order to\nconcentrate on the client and the business--said business being one of\nthose huge schemes through which a big monster of a corporation is\nconstructed by lawyers out of materials supplied by great capitalists\nand controllers of capital, is set to eating in enormous meals the\nsubstance of the people; at some obscure point in all the principal\nveins small but leechlike parasite corporations are attached,\nindustriously to suck away the surplus blood so that the owners of the\nbeast may say, \"It is eating almost nothing. See how lean it is, poor\nthing! Why, the bones fairly poke through its meager hide.\"\n\nAn interesting and highly complicated enterprise is such a construction.\nIt was of the kind in which Norman's mind especially delighted; Hercules\nis himself only in presence of an herculean labor. But on that day he\ncould not concentrate, and because of a trifle! He felt like a giant\ndisabled by a grain of dust in the eye--yes, a mere grain of dust! \"I\nmust love Josephine even more than I realize, to be fretted by such a\npaltry thing,\" thought he. And after patiently enduring the client for\nhalf an hour without being able to grasp the outlines of the project, he\nrose abruptly and said: \"I must get into my mind the points you've given\nme before we can go further. So I'll not waste your time.\"\n\nThis sounded very like \"Clear out--you've bored me to my limit of\nendurance.\" But the motions of a mind such as he knew Norman had were\nbeyond and high above the client's mere cunning at dollar-trapping. He\nfelt that it was the part of wisdom--also soothing to vanity--to assume\nthat Norman meant only what his words conveyed. When Norman was alone he\nrang for an office boy and said:\n\n\"Please ask Miss Halliday to come here.\"\n\nThe boy hesitated. \"Miss Hallowell?\" he suggested.\n\n\"Hallowell--thanks--Hallowell,\" said Norman.\n\nAnd it somehow pleased him that he had not remembered her name. How\nsignificant it was of her insignificance that so accurate a memory as\nhis should make the slip. When she, impassive, colorless, nebulous,\nstood before him the feeling of pleasure was, queerly enough, mingled\nwith a sense of humiliation. What absurd vagaries his imagination had\nindulged in! For it must have been sheer hallucination, his seeing those\nwonders in her. How he would be laughed at if those pictures he had made\nof her could be seen by any other eyes! \"They must be right when they\nsay a man in love is touched in the head. Only, why the devil should I\nhave happened to get these crazy notions about a person I've no interest\nin?\" However, the main point--and most satisfactory--was that Josephine\nwould be at a glance convinced--convicted--made ashamed of her absurd\nattack. A mere grain of dust.\n\n\"Just a moment, please,\" he said to Miss Hallowell. \"I want to give you\na note of introduction.\"\n\nHe wrote the note to Josephine Burroughs: \"Here she is. I've told her\nyou wish to talk with her about doing some work for you.\" When he\nfinished he looked up. She was standing at the window, gazing out upon\nthe tremendous panorama of skyscrapers that makes New York the most\nastounding of the cities of men. He was about to speak. The words fell\nback unuttered. For once more the hallucination--or whatever it\nwas--laid hold of him. That figure by the window--that beautiful girl,\nwith the great dreamy eyes and the soft and languorous nuances of golden\nhaze over her hair, over the skin of perfectly rounded cheek and\nperfectly moulded chin curving with ideal grace into the whitest and\nfirmest of throats----\n\n\"Am I mad? or do I really see what I see?\" he muttered.\n\nHe turned away to clear his eyes for a second view, for an attempt to\nsettle it whether he saw or imagined. When he looked again, she was\nobserving him--and once more she was the obscure, the cipherlike Miss\nHallowell, ten-dollar-a-week typewriter and not worth it. Evidently she\nnoted his confusion and was vaguely alarmed by it. He recovered himself\nas best he could and debated whether it was wise to send her to\nJosephine. Surely those transformations were not altogether his own\nhallucinations; and Josephine might see, might humiliate him by\nsuspecting more strongly--... Ridiculous! He held out the letter.\n\n\"The lady to whom this is addressed wishes to see you. Will you go\nthere, right away, please? It may be that you'll get the chance to make\nsome extra money. You've no objection, I suppose?\"\n\nShe took the letter hesitatingly.\n\n\"You will find her agreeable, I think,\" continued he. \"At any rate, the\ntrip can do no harm.\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment longer, as if weighing what he had said. \"No, it\nwill do no harm,\" she finally said. Then, with a delightful color and a\nquick transformation into a vision of young shyness, \"Thank you, Mr.\nNorman. Thank you so much.\"\n\n\"Not at all--not in the least,\" he stammered, the impulse strong to take\nthe note back and ask her to return to her desk.\n\nWhen the door closed behind her he rose and paced about the room\nuneasily. He was filled with disquiet, with hazy apprehension. His\nnerves were unsteady, as if he were going through an exhausting strain.\nHe sat and tried to force himself to work. Impossible. \"What sort of\ndamn fool attack is this?\" he exclaimed, pacing about again. He searched\nhis mind in vain for any cause adequate to explain his unprecedented\nstate. \"If I did not know that I was well--absolutely well--I'd think I\nwas about to have an illness--something in the brain.\"\n\nHe appealed to that friend in any trying hour, his sense of humor. He\nlaughed at himself; but his nerves refused to return to the normal. He\nrushed from his private office on various pretexts, each time lingered\nin the general room, talking aimlessly with Tetlow--and watching the\ndoor. When she at last appeared, he guiltily withdrew, feeling that\neveryone was observing his perturbation and was wondering at it and\njesting about it. \"And what the devil am I excited about?\" he demanded\nof himself. What indeed? He seated himself, rang the bell.\n\n\"If Miss Hallowell has got back,\" he said to the office boy, \"please ask\nher to come in.\"\n\n\"I think she's gone out to lunch,\" said the boy. \"I know she came in a\nwhile ago. She passed along as you was talking to Mr. Tetlow.\"\n\nNorman felt himself flushing. \"Any time will do,\" he said, bending over\nthe papers spread out before him--the papers in the case of the General\nTraction Company resisting the payment of its taxes. A noisome odor\nseemed to be rising from the typewritten sheets. He made a wry face and\nflung the papers aside with a gesture of disgust. \"They never do\nanything honest,\" he said to himself. \"From the stock-jobbing owners\ndown to the nickel-filching conductors they steal--steal--steal!\" And\nthen he wondered at, laughed at, his heat. What did it matter? An ant\npilfering from another ant and a sparrow stealing the crumb found by\nanother sparrow--a man robbing another man--all part of the universal\nscheme. Only a narrow-minded ignoramus would get himself wrought up over\nit; a philosopher would laugh--and take what he needed or happened to\nfancy.\n\nThe door opened. Miss Hallowell entered, a small and demure hat upon her\nmasses of thick fair hair arranged by anything but unskillful fingers.\n\"You wished to see me?\" came in the quiet little voice, sweet and frank\nand shy.\n\nHe roused himself from pretended abstraction.\n\n\"Oh--it's you?\" he said pleasantly. \"They said you were out.\"\n\n\"I was going to lunch. But if you've anything for me to do, I'll be glad\nto stay.\"\n\n\"No--no. I simply wished to say that if Miss Burroughs wished to make an\narrangement with you, we'd help you about carrying out your part of it.\"\n\nShe was pale--so pale that it brought out strongly the smooth dead-white\npurity of her skin. Her small features wore an expression of pride, of\nhaughtiness even. And in the eyes that regarded him steadily there shone\na cold light--the light of a proud and lonely soul that repels intrusion\neven as the Polar fastnesses push back without effort assault upon their\nsolitudes. \"We made no arrangement,\" said she.\n\n\"You are not more than eighteen, are you?\" inquired he abruptly.\n\nThe irrelevant question startled her. She looked as if she thought she\nhad not heard aright. \"I am twenty,\" she said.\n\n\"You have a most--most unusual way of shifting to various ages and\npersonalities,\" explained he, with some embarrassment.\n\nShe simply looked at him and waited.\n\nHis embarrassment increased. It was a novel sensation to him, this\nfeeling ill at ease with a woman--he who was at ease with everyone and\nput others at their ease or not as he pleased. \"I'm sorry you and Miss\nBurroughs didn't arrange something. I suppose she found the hours\ndifficult.\"\n\n\"She made me an offer,\" replied the girl. \"I refused it.\"\n\n\"But, as I told you, we can let you off--anything within reason.\"\n\n\"Thank you, but I do not care to do that kind of work. No doubt any kind\nof work for wages classes one as a servant. But those people up\nthere--they make one _feel_ it--feel menial.\"\n\n\"Not Miss Burroughs, I assure you.\"\n\nA satirical smile hovered round the girl's lips. Her face was altogether\nlovely now, and no lily ever rose more gracefully from its stem than did\nher small head from her slender form. \"She meant to be kind, but she was\ninsulting. Those people up there don't understand. They're vain and\nnarrow. Oh, I don't blame them. Only, I don't care to be brought into\ncontact with them.\"\n\nHe looked at her in wonder. She talked of Josephine as if she were\nJosephine's superior, and her expression and accent were such that they\ncontrived to convey an impression that she had the right to do it. He\ngrew suddenly angry at her, at himself for listening to her. \"I am\nsorry,\" he said stiffly, and took up a pen to indicate that he wished\nher to go.\n\nHe rather expected that she would be alarmed. But if she was, she wholly\nconcealed it. She smiled slightly and moved toward the door. Looking\nafter her, he relented. She seemed so young--was so young--and was\nevidently poor. He said:\n\n\"It's all right to be proud, Miss Hallowell. But there is such a thing\nas supersensitiveness. You are earning your living. If you'll pardon me\nfor thrusting advice upon you, I think you've made a mistake. I'm sure\nMiss Burroughs meant well. If you had been less sensitive you'd soon\nhave realized it.\"\n\n\"She patronized me,\" replied the girl, not angrily, but with amusement.\n\"It was all I could do not to laugh in her face. The idea of a woman who\nprobably couldn't make five dollars a week fancying she was the superior\nof any girl who makes her own living, no matter how poor a living it\nis.\"\n\nNorman laughed. It had often appealed to his own sense of humor, the\ndelusion that the tower one happened to be standing upon was part of\none's own stature. But he said: \"You're a very foolish young person.\nYou'll not get far in the world if you keep to that road. It winds\nthrough Poverty Swamps to the Poor House.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied she. \"One can always die.\"\n\nAgain he laughed. \"But why die? Why not be sensible and live?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied she. She was looking away dreamily, and her eyes\nwere wonderful to see. \"There are many things I feel and do--and I don't\nat all understand why. But--\" An expression of startling resolution\nflashed across her face. \"But I do them, just the same.\"\n\nA brief silence; then, as she again moved toward the door, he said, \"You\nhave been working for some time?\"\n\n\"Four years.\"\n\n\"You support yourself?\"\n\n\"I work to help out father's income. He makes almost enough, but not\nquite.\"\n\nAlmost enough! The phrase struck upon Norman's fancy as both amusing and\nsad. Almost enough for what? For keeping body and soul together; for\nkeeping body barely decently clad. Yet she was content. He said:\n\n\"You like to work?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But I think I shall when I learn this business. One feels\nsecure when one has a trade.\"\n\n\"It doesn't impress me as an interesting life for a girl of your age,\"\nhe suggested.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not unhappy. And at home, of evenings and Sundays, I'm happy.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Reading and talking with father and--doing the housework--and all the\nrest of it.\"\n\nWhat a monotonous narrow little life! He wanted to pity her, but somehow\nhe could not. There was no suggestion in her manner that she was an\nobject of pity. \"What did Miss Burroughs say to you--if I may ask?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You sent me, and I'm much obliged to you. I realize it was\nan opportunity--for another sort of girl. I half tried to accept because\nI knew refusing was only my--queerness.\" She smiled charmingly. \"You are\nnot offended because I couldn't make myself take it?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\" And all at once he felt that it was true. This girl\nwould have been out of place in service. \"What was the offer?\"\n\nSuddenly before him there appeared a clever, willful child, full of the\nchildish passion for imitation and mockery. And she proceeded to \"take\noff\" the grand Miss Burroughs--enough like Josephine to give the satire\npoint and barb. He could see Josephine resolved to be affable and equal,\nto make this doubtless bedazzled stray from the \"lower classes\" feel\ncomfortable in those palatial surroundings. She imitated Josephine's\nwalk, her way of looking, her voice for the menials--gracious and\ncondescending. The exhibition was clever, free from malice, redolent of\nhumor. Norman laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\"You ought to go on the stage,\" said he. \"How Josephine--Miss Burroughs\nwould appreciate it! For she's got a keen sense of humor.\"\n\n\"Not for the real jokes--like herself,\" replied Miss Hallowell.\n\n\"You're prejudiced.\"\n\n\"No. I see her as she is. Probably everyone else--those around her--see\nher money and her clothes and all that. But I saw--just her.\"\n\nHe nodded thoughtfully. Then he looked penetratingly at her. \"How did\nyou happen to learn to do that?\" he asked. \"To see people as they are?\"\n\n\"Father taught me.\" Her eyes lighted up, her whole expression changed.\nShe became beautiful with the beauty of an intense and adoring love.\n\"Father is a wonderful man--one of the most wonderful that ever lived.\nHe----\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door. She startled, he looked confused. Both\nawakened to a sense of their forgotten surroundings, of who and what\nthey were. She went and Mr. Sanders entered. But even in his confusion\nNorman marveled at the vanishing of the fascinating personality who had\nbeen captivating him into forgetting everything else, at the\nreappearance of the blank, the pale and insignificant personality\nattached to a typewriting machine at ten dollars a week. No, not\ninsignificant, not blank--never again that, for him. He saw now the full\nreality--and also why he, everyone, was so misled. She made him think of\nthe surface of the sea when the sky is gray and the air calm. It lies\nsmooth and flat and expressionless--inert, monotonous. But let sunbeam\nstrike or breeze ever so faint start up, and what a commotion of\nunending variety! He could never look at her again without being\nreminded of those infinite latent possibilities, without wondering what\nnew and perhaps more charming, more surprising varieties of look and\ntone and manner could be evoked.\n\nAnd while Sanders was talking--prosing on and on about things Norman\neither already knew or did not wish to know--he was thinking of her. \"If\nshe happens to meet a man with enough discernment to fall in love with\nher,\" he said to himself, \"he certainly will never weary. What a pity\nthat such a girl shouldn't have had a chance, should be wasted on some\nunappreciative chucklehead of her class! What a pity she hasn't\nambition--or the quality, whatever it is--that makes those who have it\nget on, whether they wish or no.\"\n\nDuring the rest of the day he revolved from time to time indistinct\nideas of somehow giving this girl a chance. He wished Josephine would\nand could help, or perhaps his sister Ursula. It was not a matter that\ncould be settled, or even taken up, in haste. No man of his mentality\nand experience fails to learn how perilous it is in the least to\ninterfere in the destiny of anyone. And his notion involved not slight\ninterference with advice or suggestion or momentarily extended helping\nhand, but radical change of the whole current of destiny. Also, he\nappreciated how difficult it is for a man to do anything for a young\nwoman--anything that would not harm more than it would help. Only one\nthing seemed clear to him--the \"clever child\" ought to have a chance.\n\nHe went to see Josephine after dinner that night His own house, while\nrichly and showily furnished, as became his means and station,\nseemed--and indeed was--merely an example of simple, old-fashioned\n\"solid comfort\" in comparison with the Burroughs palace. He had never\nliked, but, being a true New Yorker, had greatly admired the splendor of\nthat palace, its costly art junk, its rotten old tapestries, its\nunlovely genuine antiques, its room after room of tasteless\nmagnificence, suggesting a museum, or rather the combination home and\nsalesroom of an art dealer. This evening he found himself curious,\ncritical, disposed to license a long-suppressed sense of humor. While\nhe was waiting for Josephine to come down to the small salon into which\nhe had been shown, her older sister drifted in, on the way to a late\ndinner and ball. She eyed him admiringly from head to foot.\n\n\"You've _such_ an air, Fred,\" said she. \"You should hear the butler on the\nsubject of you. He says that of all the men who come to the house you\nare most the man of the world. He says he could tell it by the way you\nwalk in and take off your hat and coat and throw them at him.\"\n\nNorman laughed and said, \"I didn't know. I must stop that.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Mrs. Bellowes. \"You'll break his heart. He adores it. You\nknow, servants dearly love to be treated as servants. Anyone who thinks\nthe world loves equality knows very little about human nature. Most\npeople love to look up, just as most women love to be ruled. No, you\nmust continue to be the master, the man of the world, Fred.\"\n\nShe was busy with her gorgeous and trailing wraps and with her cigarette\nor she would have seen his confusion. He was recalling his scene with\nthe typewriter girl. Not much of the man of the world, then and there,\ncertainly. What a grotesque performance for a man of his position, for a\nserious man of any kind! And how came he to permit such a person to\nmimic Josephine Burroughs, a lady, the woman to whom he was engaged? In\nthese proud and pretentious surroundings he felt contemptibly\nguilty--and dazed wonder at his own inexplicable folly and weakness.\n\nMrs. Bellowes departed before Josephine came down. So there was no\nrelief for his embarrassment. He saw that she too felt constrained.\nInstead of meeting him half way in embrace and kiss, as she usually did,\nshe threw him a kiss and pretended to be busy lighting a cigarette and\narranging the shades of the table lamp. \"Well, I saw your 'poor little\ncreature,'\" she began. She was splendidly direct in all her dealings,\nafter the manner of people who have never had to make their own way--to\ncajole or conciliate or dread the consequences of frankness.\n\n\"I told you you'd not find her interesting.\"\n\n\"Oh, she was a nice little girl,\" replied Josephine with elaborate\ngraciousness--and Norman, the \"take off\" fresh in his mind, was acutely\ncritical of her manner, of her mannerisms. \"Of course,\" she went on,\n\"one does not expect much of people of that class. But I thought her\nunusually well-mannered--and quite clean.\"\n\n\"Tetlow makes 'em clean up,\" said Norman, a gleam of sarcasm in his\ncareless glance and tone. And into his nostrils stole an odor of\nfreshness and health and youth, the pure, sweet odor that is the base of\nall the natural perfumes. It startled him, his vivid memory of a feature\nof her which he had not been until now aware that he had ever noted.\n\n\"I offered her some work,\" continued Josephine, \"but I guess you keep\nher too busy down there for her to do anything else.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Norman. \"Why do you sit on the other side of the room?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" laughed Josephine. \"I feel queer to-night. And it\nseems to me you're queer, too.\"\n\n\"I? Perhaps rather tired, dear--that's all.\"\n\n\"Did you and Miss Hallowell work hard to-day?\"\n\n\"Oh, bother Miss Hallowell. Let's talk about ourselves.\" And he drew her\nto the sofa at one end of the big fireplace. \"I wish we hadn't set the\nwedding so far off.\" And suddenly he found himself wondering whether\nthat remark had been prompted by eagerness--a lover's eagerness--or by\nimpatience to have the business over and settled.\n\n\"You don't act a bit natural to-night, Fred. You touch me as if I were a\nstranger.\"\n\n\"I like that!\" mocked he. \"A stranger hold your hand like\nthis?--and--kiss you--like this?\"\n\nShe drew away, suddenly laid her hands on his shoulders, kissed him upon\nthe lips passionately, then looked into his eyes. \"_Do_ you love me,\nFred?--_really_?\"\n\n\"Why so earnest?\"\n\n\"You've had a great deal of experience?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"Have you ever loved any woman as you love me?\"\n\n\"I've never loved any woman but you. I never before wanted to marry a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"But you may be doing it because--well, you might be tired and want to\nsettle down.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. But I want to hear you say it isn't so.\"\n\n\"Well--it isn't so. Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"I'm frightfully jealous of you, Fred.\"\n\n\"What a waste of time!\"\n\n\"I've got something to confess--something I'm ashamed of.\"\n\n\"Don't confess,\" cried he, laughing but showing that he meant it.\n\"Just--don't be wicked again That's much better than confession.\"\n\n\"But I must confess,\" insisted she. \"I had evil thoughts evil suspicions\nabout you. I've had them all day--until you came. As soon as I saw you I\nfelt bowed into the dust. A man like you, doing anything so vulgar as I\nsuspected you of--oh, dearest, I'm _so_ ashamed!\"\n\nHe put his arms round her and drew her to his shoulder. And the scene of\nmimicry in his office flashed into his mind, and the blood burned in his\ncheeks. But he had no such access of insanity as to entertain the idea\nof confession.\n\n\"It was that typewriter girl,\" continued Josephine. She drew away again\nand once more searched his face. \"You told me she was homely.\"\n\n\"Not exactly that.\"\n\n\"Insignificant then.\"\n\n\"Isn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes--in a way,\" said Josephine, the condescending note in her voice\nagain--and in his mind Miss Hallowell's clever burlesque of that note.\n\"But, in another way--Men are different from women. Now I--a woman of\nmy sort--couldn't stoop to a man of her class. But men seem not to feel\nthat way.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, irritated. \"They've the courage to take what they want\nwherever they find it. A man will take gold out of the dirt, because\ngold is always gold. But a woman waits until she can get it at a\nfashionable jeweler's, and makes sure it's made up in a fashionable way.\nI don't like to hear _you_ say those things.\"\n\nHer eyes flashed. \"Then you _do_ like that Hallowell girl!\" she cried--and\nnever before had her voice jarred upon him.\n\n\"That Hallowell girl has nothing to do with this,\" he rejoined. \"I like\nto feel that you really love me--that you'd have taken me wherever you\nhappened to find me--and that you'd stick to me no matter how far I\nmight drop.\"\n\n\"I would! I would!\" she cried, tears in her eyes. \"Oh, I didn't mean\nthat, Fred. You know I didn't--don't you?\"\n\nShe tried to put her arms round his neck, but he took her hands and held\nthem. \"Would you like to think I was marrying you for what you have?--or\nfor any other reason whatever but for what you are?\"\n\nIt being once more a question of her own sex, the obstinate line\nappeared round her mouth. \"But, Fred, I'd not be _me_, if I were--a\nworking girl,\" she replied.\n\n\"You might be something even better if you were,\" retorted he coldly.\n\"The only qualities I don't like about you are the surface qualities\nthat have been plated on in these surroundings. And if I thought it was\nanything but just you that I was marrying, I'd lose no time about\nleaving you. I'd not let myself degrade myself.\"\n\n\"Fred--that tone--and don't--please don't look at me like that!\" she\nbegged.\n\n[Illustration: \"'Would you like to think I was marrying you for what you\nhave?--or for any other reason whatever but for what you are?'\"]\n\nBut his powerful glance searched on. He said, \"Is it possible that you\nand I are deceiving ourselves--and that we'll marry and wake up--and be\nbored and dissatisfied--like so many of our friends?\"\n\n\"No--no,\" she cried, wildly agitated. \"Fred, dear we love each other.\nYou know we do. I don't use words as well as you do--and my mind works\nin a queer way--Perhaps I didn't mean what I said. No matter. If my\nlove were put to the test--Fred, I don't ask anything more than that\nyour love for me would stand the tests my love for you would stand.\"\n\nHe caught her in his arms and kissed her with more passion than he had\never felt for her before. \"I believe you, Jo,\" he said. \"I believe you.\"\n\n\"I love you so--that I could be jealous even of her--of that little girl\nin your office. Fred, I didn't confess all the truth. It isn't true that\nI thought her--a nobody. When she first came in here--it was in this\nvery room--I thought she was as near nothing as any girl I'd ever seen.\nThen she began to change--as you said. And--oh, dearest, I can't help\nhating her! And when I tried to get her away from you, and she wouldn't\ncome----\"\n\n\"Away from me!\" he cried, laughing.\n\n\"I felt as if it were like that,\" she pleaded. \"And she wouldn't\ncome--and treated me as if she were queen and I servant--only politely,\nI must say, for Heaven knows I don't want to injure her----\"\n\n\"Shall I have her discharged?\"\n\n\"Fred!\" exclaimed she indignantly. \"Do you think I could do such a\nthing?\"\n\n\"She'd easily get another job as good. Tetlow can find her one. Does\nthat satisfy you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she confessed. \"It makes me feel meaner than ever.\"\n\n\"Now, Jo, let's drop this foolish seriousness about nothing at all.\nLet's drop it for good.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all--that's exactly it. I can't understand, Fred. What is\nthere about her that makes her haunt me? That makes me afraid she'll\nhaunt you?\"\n\nNorman felt a sudden thrill. He tightened his hold upon her hands\nbecause his impulse had been to release them. \"How absurd!\" he said,\nrather noisily.\n\n\"Isn't it, though?\" echoed she. \"Think of you and me almost quarreling\nabout such a trivial person.\" Her laugh died away. She shivered, cried,\n\"Fred, I'm superstitious about her. I'm--I'm--_afraid_!\" And she flung\nherself wildly into his arms.\n\n\"She _is_ somewhat uncanny,\" said he, with a lightness he was far from\nfeeling. \"But, dear--it isn't complimentary to me, is it?\"\n\n\"Forgive me, dearest--I don't mean that. I couldn't mean that. But--I\n_love_ you so. Ever since I began to love you I've been looking round for\nsomething to be afraid of. And this is the first chance you've given\nme.\"\n\n\"_I've_ given you!\" mocked he.\n\nShe laughed hysterically. \"I mean the first chance I've had. And I'm\ndoing the best I can with it.\"\n\nThey were in good spirits now, and for the rest of the evening were as\nloverlike as always, the nearer together for the bit of rough sea they\nhad weathered so nicely. Neither spoke of Miss Hallowell. Each had\nprivately resolved never to speak of her to the other again. Josephine\nwas already regretting the frankness that had led her to expose a not\ntoo attractive part of herself--and to exaggerate in his eyes the\nimportance of a really insignificant chit of a typewriter. When he went\nto bed that night he was resolved to have Tetlow find Miss Hallowell a\njob in another office.\n\n\"She certainly _is_ uncanny,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder why--I wonder\nwhat the secret of her is. She's the first woman I ever ran across who\nhad a real secret. _Is_ it real? I wonder.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nToward noon the following day Norman, suddenly in need of a\nstenographer, sent out for Miss Purdy, one of the three experts at\neighteen dollars a week who did most of the important and very\nconfidential work for the heads of the firm. When his door opened again\nhe saw not Miss Purdy but Miss Hallowell.\n\n\"Miss Purdy is sick to-day,\" said she. \"Mr. Tetlow wishes to know if I\nwould do.\"\n\nNorman shifted uneasily in his chair. \"Just as\nwell--perfectly--certainly,\" he stammered. He was not looking at\nher--seemed wholly occupied with the business he was preparing to\ndispatch.\n\nShe seated herself in the usual place, at the opposite side of the broad\ntable. With pencil poised she fixed her gaze upon the unmarred page of\nher open notebook. Instead of abating, his confusion increased. He could\nnot think of the subject about which he wished to dictate. First, he\nnoted how long her lashes were--and darker than her hair, as were her\nwell-drawn eyebrows also. Never had he seen so white a skin or one so\nsmooth. She happened to be wearing a blouse with a Dutch neck that day.\nWhat a superb throat! What a line of beauty its gently swelling curve\nmade. Then his glance fell upon her lips, rosy-red, slightly pouted. And\nwhat masses of dead gold hair--no, not gold, but of the white-gray of\nwood ashes, and tinted with gold! No wonder it was difficult to tell\njust what color her hair was. Hair like that was ready to be of any\ncolor. And there were her arms, so symmetrical in her rather tight\nsleeves, and emerging into view in the most delicate wrists. What a\nmarvelous skin!\n\n\"Have you ever posed?\"\n\nShe startled and the color flamed in her cheeks. Her eyes shot a glance\nof terror at him. \"I--I,\" she stammered. Then almost defiantly, \"Yes, I\ndid--for a while. But I didn't suppose anyone knew. At the time we\nneeded the money badly.\"\n\nNorman felt deep disgust with himself for bursting out with such a\nquestion, and for having surprised her secret. \"There's nothing to be\nashamed of,\" he said gently.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not ashamed,\" she returned. Her agitation had subsided. \"The\nonly reason I quit was because the work was terribly hard and the pay\nsmall and uncertain. I was confused because they discharged me at the\nlast place I had, when they found out I had been a model. It was a\nchurch paper office.\"\n\nAgain she poised her pencil and lowered her eyes. But he did not take\nthe hint. \"Is there anything you would rather do than this sort of\nwork?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing I could afford,\" replied she.\n\n\"If you had been kind to Miss Burroughs yesterday she would have helped\nyou.\"\n\n\"I couldn't afford to do that,\" said the girl in her quiet, reticent\nway.\n\n\"To do what?\"\n\n\"To be nice to anyone for what I could get out of it.\"\n\nNorman smiled somewhat cynically. Probably the girl fancied she was\ntruthful; but human beings rarely knew anything about their real selves.\n\"What would you like to do?\"\n\nShe did not answer his question until she had shrunk completely within\nherself and was again thickly veiled with the expression which made\neveryone think her insignificant. \"Nothing I could afford to do,\" said\nshe. It was plain that she did not wish to be questioned further along\nthat line.\n\n\"The stage?\" he persisted.\n\n\"I hadn't thought of it,\" was her answer.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"I don't think about things I can't have. I never made any definite\nplans.\"\n\n\"But isn't it a good idea always to look ahead? As long as one has to be\nmoving, one might as well move in a definite direction.\"\n\nShe was waiting with pencil poised.\n\n\"There isn't much of a future at this business.\"\n\nShe shrank slightly. He felt that she regarded his remark as preparation\nfor a kindly hint that she was not giving satisfaction. . . . Well, why not\nleave it that way? Perhaps she would quit of her own accord--would spare\nhim the trouble--and embarrassment--of arranging with Tetlow for another\nplace for her. He began to dictate--gave her a few sentences mockingly\ndifferent from his usual terse and clear statements--interrupted himself\nwith:\n\n\"You misunderstood me a while ago. I didn't mean you weren't doing your\nwork well. On the contrary, I think you'll soon be expert. But I thought\nperhaps I might be able to help you to something you'd like better.\"\n\nHe listened to his own words in astonishment. What new freak of madness\nwas this? Instead of clearing himself of this uncanny girl, he was\nproposing things to her that would mean closer relations. And what\nreason had he to think she was fitted for anything but just what she was\nnow doing--doing indifferently well?\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, so quietly that it seemed coldly, \"but I'm\nsatisfied as I am.\"\n\nHer manner seemed to say with polite and restrained plainness that she\nwas not in the least appreciative of his interest or of himself. But\nthis could not be. No girl in her position could fail to be grateful for\nhis interest. No woman, in all his life, had ever failed to respond to\nhis slightest advance. No, it simply could not be. She was merely shy,\nand had a peculiar way of showing it. He said:\n\n\"You have no ambition?\"\n\n\"That's not for a woman.\"\n\nShe was making her replies as brief as civility permitted. He observed\nher narrowly. She was not shy, not embarrassed. What kind of game was\nthis? It could not be in sincere nature for a person in her position\nthus to treat overtures, friendly and courteous overtures, from one in\nhis position. And never before--never--had a woman been thus\nunresponsive. Instead of feeling relief that she had disentangled him\nfrom the plight into which his impulsive offer had flung him, he was\npiqued--angered--and his curiosity was inflamed as never before about\nany woman.\n\nThe relations of the sexes are for the most part governed by traditions\nof sex allurements and sex tricks so ancient that they have ceased to be\nconscious and have become instinctive. One of these venerable first\nprinciples is that mystery is the arch provoker. Norman, an old and\nexpert student of the great game--the only game for which the staidest\nand most serious will abandon all else to follow its merry call--Norman\nknew this trick of mystery. The woman veils herself and makes believe to\nfly--an excellent trick, as good to-day as ever after five thousand\nyears of service. And he knew that in it lay the explanation for the\nsudden and high upflaming of his interest in this girl. \"What an ass I'm\nmaking of myself!\" reflected he. \"When I care nothing about the girl,\nwhy should I care about the mystery of her? Of course, it's some poor\nlittle affair, a puzzle not worth puzzling out.\"\n\nAll true and clear enough. Yet seeing it did not abate his interest a\nparticle. She had veiled herself; she was pretending--perhaps\nhonestly--to fly. He rose and went to the window, stood with his back to\nher, resumed dictating. But the sentences would not come. He whirled\nabruptly. \"I'm not ready to do the thing yet,\" he said. \"I'll send for\nyou later.\"\n\nWithout a word or a glance she stood, took her book and went toward the\ndoor. He gazed after her. He could not refrain from speaking again. \"I'm\nafraid you misunderstood my offer a while ago,\" said he, neither curt\nnor friendly. \"I forgot how such things from a man to a young woman\nmight be misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" replied she unembarrassed. \"It was simply\nthat I can't put myself under obligation to anyone.\"\n\nAs she stood there, her full beauty flashed upon him--the exquisite\nform, the subtly graceful poise of her body, of her head--the loveliness\nof that golden-hued white skin--the charm of her small rosy mouth--the\ndelicate, sensitive, slightly tilted nose--and her eyes--above all, her\neyes!--so clear, so sweet. Her voice had seemed thin and faint to him;\nits fineness now seemed the rarest delicacy--the exactly fitting kind\nfor so evasive and delicate a beauty as hers. He made a slight bow of\ndismissal, turned abruptly away. Never in all his life, strewn with\ngallant experiences--never had a woman thus treated him, and never had a\nwoman thus affected him. \"I am mad--stark mad!\" he muttered. \"A\nten-dollar-a-week typewriter, whom nobody on earth but myself would look\nat a second time!\" But something within him hurled back this scornful\nfling. Though no one else on earth saw or appreciated--what of it? She\naffected _him_ thus--and that was enough. \"_I_ want her! . . . I _want_\nher! I have never wanted a woman before.\"\n\nHe rushed into the dressing room attached to his office, plunged his\nface into ice-cold water. This somewhat eased the burning sensation that\nwas becoming intolerable. Many were the unaccountable incidents in his\nacquaintance with this strange creature; the most preposterous was this\nsudden seizure. He realized now that his feeling for her had been like\nthe quiet, steady, imperceptible filling of a reservoir that suddenly\nannounces itself by the thunder and roar of a mighty cascade over the\ndam. \"This is madness--sheer madness! I am still master within myself. I\nwill make short work of this rebellion.\" And with an air of calmness so\nconvincing that he believed in it he addressed himself to the task of\nsanity and wisdom lying plain before him. \"A man of my position caught\nby a girl like that! A man such as I am, caught by _any_ woman whatever!\"\nIt was grotesque. He opened his door to summon Tetlow.\n\nThe gate in the outside railing was directly opposite, and about thirty\nfeet away. Tetlow and Miss Hallowell were going out--evidently to lunch\ntogether. She was looking up at the chief clerk with laughing eyes--they\nseemed coquettish to the infuriated Norman. And Tetlow--the serious and\nsquab young ass was gazing at her with the expression men of the stupid\nsquab sort put on when they wish to impress a woman. At this spectacle,\nat the vision of that slim young loveliness, that perfect form and\ndeliciously smooth soft skin, white beyond belief beneath its faintly\ngolden tint--the hot blood steamed up into Norman's brain, blinded his\nsight, reddened it with desire and jealousy. He drew back, closed his\ndoor with a bang.\n\n\"This is not I,\" he muttered. \"What has happened? Am I insane?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Tetlow returned from lunch the office boy on duty at the gate told\nhim that Mr. Norman wished to see him at once. Like all men trying to\nadvance along ways where their fellow men can help or hinder, the head\nclerk was full of more or less clever little tricks thought out with a\nview to making a good impression. One of them was to stamp upon all\nminds his virtue of promptness--of what use to be prompt unless you\nforced every one to feel how prompt you were? He went in to see Norman,\nwith hat in hand and overcoat on his back and one glove off, the other\nstill on. Norman was standing at a window, smoking a cigarette. His\nappearance--dress quite as much as manner--was the envy of his\nsubordinate--as, indeed, it was of hundreds of the young men struggling\nto rise down town. It was so exactly what the appearance of a man of\nvigor and power and high position should be. Tetlow practiced it by the\nquarter hour before his glass at home--not without progress in the\ndirection of a not unimpressive manner of his own.\n\nAs Tetlow stood at attention, Norman turned and advanced toward him.\n\"Mr. Tetlow,\" he began, in his good-humored voice with the never wholly\nsubmerged under-note of sharpness, \"is it your habit to go out to lunch\nwith the young ladies employed here? If so, I wish to suggest--simply to\nsuggest--that it may be bad for discipline.\"\n\nTetlow's jaw dropped a little. He looked at Norman, was astonished to\ndiscover beneath a thin veneer of calm signs of greater agitation than\nhe had ever seen in him. \"To-day was the first time, sir,\" he said. \"And\nI can't quite account for my doing it. Miss Hallowell has been here\nseveral months. I never specially noticed her until the last few\ndays--when the question of discharging her came up. You may remember it\nwas settled by you.\" Norman flung his cigarette away and stalked to the\nwindow.\n\n\"Mr. Norman,\" pursued Tetlow, \"you and I have been together many years.\nI esteem it my greatest honor that I am able--that you permit me--to\nclass you as my friend. So I'm going to give you a confidence--one that\nreally startles me. I called on Miss Hallowell last night.\"\n\nNorman's back stiffened.\n\n\"She is even more charming in her own home. And--\" Tetlow blushed and\ntrembled--\"I am going to make her my wife if I can.\"\n\nNorman turned, a mocking satirical smile unpleasantly sparkling in his\neyes and curling his mouth \"Old man,\" he said, \"I think you've gone\ncrazy.\"\n\nTetlow made a helpless gesture. \"I think so myself. I didn't intend to\nmarry for ten years--and then--I had quite a different match in mind.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you, Billy?\" inquired Norman, inspecting him\nwith smiling, cruelly unfriendly eyes.\n\n\"I'm damned if I know, Norman,\" said the head clerk, assuming that his\nfriend was sympathetic and dropping into the informality of the old days\nwhen they were clerks together in a small firm. \"I'd have proposed to\nher last night if I hadn't been afraid I'd lose her by being in such a\nhurry. . . . You're in love yourself.\"\n\nNorman startled violently.\n\n\"You're going to get married. Probably you can sympathize. You know how\nit is to meet the woman you want and must have.\"\n\nNorman turned away.\n\n\"I've had--or thought I had--rather advanced ideas on the subject of\nwomen. I've always had a horror of being married for a living or for a\nhome or as an experiment or a springboard. My notion's been that I\nwouldn't trust a woman who wasn't independent. And theoretically I still\nthink that's sound. But it doesn't work out in practice. A man has to\nhave been in love to be able to speak the last word on the sex\nquestion.\"\n\nNorman dropped heavily into his desk chair and rumpled his hair into\ndisorder. He muttered something--the head clerk thought it was an oath.\n\n\"I'd marry her,\" Tetlow went on, \"if I knew she was simply using me in\nthe coldest, most calculating way. My only fear is that I shan't be able\nto get her--that she won't marry me.\"\n\nNorman sneered. \"That's not likely,\" he said.\n\n\"No, it isn't,\" admitted Tetlow. \"They--the Hallowells--are nice\npeople--of as good family as there is. But they're poor--very poor.\nThere's only her father and herself. The old man is a scientist--spends\nmost of his time at things that won't pay a cent--utterly impractical. A\ngentleman--an able man, if a little cracked--at least he seemed so to me\nwho don't know much about scientific matters. But getting poorer\nsteadily. So I think she will accept me.\"\n\nA gloomy, angry frown, like a black shadow, passed across Norman's face\nand disappeared. \"You'd marry her--on those terms?\" he sneered.\n\n\"Of course I _hope_ for better terms----\"\n\nNorman sprang up, strode to the window and turned his back.\n\n\"But I'm prepared for the worst. The fact is, she treats me as if she\ndidn't care a rap for the honor of my showing her attention.\"\n\n\"A trick, Billy. An old trick.\"\n\n\"Maybe so. But--I really believe she doesn't realize. She's queer--has\nbeen queerly brought up. Yes, I think she doesn't appreciate. Then, too,\nshe's young and light--almost childish in some ways. . . . I don't blame\nyou for being disgusted with me, Fred. But--damn it, what's a man to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Cure himself!\" exploded Norman, wheeling violently on his friend. \"You\nmust act like a man. Billy, such a marriage is ruin for you. How can we\ntake you into partnership next year? When you marry, you must marry in\nthe class you're moving toward, not in any of those you're leaving\nbehind.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I haven't thought of all that?\" rejoined Tetlow\nbitterly. \"But I can't help myself. It's useless for me to say I'll try.\nI shan't try.\"\n\n\"Don't you want to get over this?\" demanded Norman fiercely.\n\n\"Of course--No--I don't. Fred, you'd think better of me if you knew\nher. You've never especially noticed her. She's beautiful.\"\n\nNorman dropped to his chair again.\n\n\"Really--beautiful,\" protested Tetlow, assuming that the gesture was one\nof disgusted denial. \"Take a good look at her, Norman, before you\ncondemn her. I never was so astonished as when I discovered how\ngood-looking she is. I don't quite know how it is, but I suppose nobody\never happened to see how--how lovely she is until I just chanced to see\nit.\" At a rudely abrupt gesture from Norman he hurried on, eagerly\napologetic, \"And if you talk with her--She's very reserved. But she's\nthe lady through and through--and has a good mind. . . . At least, I\nthink she has. I'll admit a man in love is a poor judge of a woman's\nmind. But, anyhow, I _know_ she's lovely to look at. You'll see it\nyourself, now that I've called your attention to it. You can't fail to\nsee it.\"\n\nNorman threw himself back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his\nhead. \"_Why_ do you want to marry her?\" he inquired, in a tone his\nsensitive ear approved as judicial.\n\n\"How can I tell?\" replied the head clerk irritably. \"Does a man ever\nknow?\"\n\n\"Always--when he's sensibly in love.\"\n\n\"But when he's just in love? That's what ails me,\" retorted Tetlow, with\na sheepish look and laugh.\n\n\"Billy, you've got to get over this. I can't let you make a fool of\nyourself.\"\n\nTetlow's fat, smooth, pasty face of the overfed, underexercised\nprofessional man became a curious exhibit of alarm and obstinacy.\n\n\"You've got to promise me you'll keep away from her--except at the\noffice--for say, a week. Then--we'll see.\"\n\nTetlow debated.\n\n\"It's highly improbable that anyone else will discover these\nirresistible charms. There's no one else hanging round?\"\n\n\"No one, as I told you the other day, when you questioned me about her.\"\n\nNorman shifted, looked embarrassed.\n\n\"I hope I didn't give you the impression I was ashamed of loving her or\nwould ever be ashamed of her anywhere?\" continued Tetlow, a very\nloverlike light in his usually unromantic eyes. \"If I did, it wasn't\nwhat I meant--far from it. You'll see, when I marry her, Norman. You'll\nbe congratulating me.\"\n\nNorman sprang up again. \"This is plain lunacy, Tetlow. I am amazed at\nyou--amazed!\"\n\n\"Get acquainted with her, Mr. Norman,\" pleaded the subordinate. \"Do it,\nto oblige me. Don't condemn us----\"\n\n\"I wish to hear nothing more!\" cried Norman violently. \"Another thing.\nYou must find her a place in some other office--at once.\"\n\n\"You're right, sir,\" assented Tetlow. \"I can readily do that.\"\n\nNorman scowled at him, made an imperious gesture of dismissal. Tetlow,\nchopfallen but obdurate, got himself speedily out of sight.\n\nNorman, with hands deep in his pockets, stared out among the skyscrapers\nand gave way to a fit of remorse. It was foreign to his nature to do\npetty underhanded tricks. Grand strategy--yes. At that he was an adept,\nand not the shiftiest, craftiest schemes he had ever devised had given\nhim a moment's uneasiness. But to be driving a ten-dollar-a-week\ntypewriter out of her job--to be maneuvering to deprive her of a for\nher brilliant marriage--to be lying to an old and loyal retainer who had\nhelped Norman full as much and as often as Norman had helped him--these\nsneaking bits of skullduggery made him feel that he had sunk indeed. But\nhe ground his teeth together and his eyes gleamed wickedly. \"He shan't\nhave her, damn him!\" he muttered. \"She's not for him.\"\n\nHe summoned Tetlow, who was obviously low in mind as the result of\nrevolving the things that had been said to him. \"Billy,\" he began in a\ntone so amiable that he was ashamed for himself, \"you'll not forget I\nhave your promise?\"\n\n\"What did I promise?\" cried Tetlow, his voice shrill with alarm.\n\n\"Not to see her, except at the office, for a week.\"\n\n\"But I've promised her father I'd call this evening. He's going to show\nme some experiments.\"\n\n\"You can easily make an excuse--business.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to,\" protested the head clerk. \"What's the use? I've\ngot my mind made up. Norman, I'd hang on after her if you fired me out\nof this office for it. And I can't rest--I'm fit for nothing--until\nthis matter's settled. I came very near taking her aside and proposing\nto her, just after I went out of here a while ago.\"\n\n\"You _damn_ fool!\" cried Norman, losing all control of himself. \"Take the\nafternoon express for Albany instead of Harcott and attend to those\nregistrations and arrange for those hearings. I'll do my best to save\nyou. I'll bring the girl in here and keep her at work until you get out\nof the way.\"\n\nTetlow glanced at his friend; then the tears came into his eyes. \"You're\na hell of a friend!\" he ejaculated. \"And I thought you'd sympathize\nbecause you were in love.\"\n\n\"I do sympathize, Billy,\" Norman replied with an abrupt change to\nshamefaced apology. \"I sympathize more than you know. I feel like a dog,\ndoing this. But it can't result in any harm, and I want you to get a\nlittle fresh air in that hot brain of yours before you commit yourself.\nBe reasonable, old man. Suppose you rushed ahead and proposed--and she\naccepted--and then, after a few days, you came to. What about her? You\nmust act on the level, Tetlow. Do the fair thing by yourself and by\nher.\"\n\nNorman had often had occasion to feel proud of the ingenuity and\nresourcefulness of his brain. He had never been quite so proud as he was\nwhen he finished that speech. It pacified Tetlow; it lightened his own\nsense of guilt; it gave him a respite.\n\nTetlow rewarded Norman with the look that in New York is the equivalent\nof the handclasp friend seeks from friend in times of stress. \"You're\nright, Fred. I'm much obliged to you. I haven't been considering _her_\nside of it enough. A man ought always to think of that. The women--poor\nthings--have a hard enough time to get on, at best.\"\n\nNorman's smile was characteristically cynical. Sentimentality amused\nhim. \"I doubt if there are more female wrecks than male wrecks scattered\nabout the earth,\" rejoined he. \"And I suspect the fact isn't due to the\ngentleness of man with woman, either. Don't fret for the ladies, Tetlow.\nThey know how to take care of themselves. They know how to milk with a\nsure and a steady hand. You may find it out by depressing experience\nsome day.\"\n\nTetlow saw the aim. His obstinate, wretched expression came back. \"I\ndon't care. I've got----\"\n\n\"You went over that ground,\" interrupted Norman impatiently. \"You'd\nbetter be catching the train.\"\n\nAs Tetlow withdrew, he rang for an office boy and sent him to summon\nMiss Hallowell.\n\nNorman had been reasoning with himself--with the aid of the self that\nwas both better and more worldly wise. He felt that his wrestlings had\nnot been wholly futile. He believed he had got the strength to face the\ngirl with a respectful mind, with a mind resolute in duty--if not\nlove--toward Josephine Burroughs. \"I _love_ Josephine,\" he said to\nhimself. \"My feeling for this girl is some sort of physical attraction.\nI certainly shall be able to control it enough to keep it within myself.\nAnd soon it will die out. No doubt I've felt much the same thing as\nstrongly before. But it didn't take hold because I was never bound\nbefore--never had the sense of the necessity for restraint. That sense\nis always highly dangerous for my sort of man.\"\n\nThis sounded well. He eyed the entering girl coldly, said in a voice\nthat struck him as excellent indifference, \"Bring your machine in here,\nMiss Hallowell, and recopy these papers. I've made some changes. If you\nspoil any sheets, don't throw them away, but return everything to me.\"\n\n\"I'm always careful about the waste-paper baskets,\" said she, \"since\nthey warned me that there are men who make a living searching the waste\nthrown out of offices.\"\n\nHe made no reply. He could not have spoken if he had tried. Once more\nthe spell had seized him--the spell of her weird fascination for him. As\nshe sat typewriting, with her back almost toward him, he sat watching\nher and analyzing his own folly. He knew that diagnosing a disease does\nnot cure it; but he found an acute pleasure in lingering upon all the\ndetails of the effect she had upon his nerves. He did not dare move from\nhis desk, from the position that put a huge table and a revolving case\nof reference books between them. He believed that if he went nearer he\nwould be unable to resist seizing her in his arms and pouring out the\npassion that was playing along his nerves as the delicate, intense flame\nflits back and forth along the surface of burning alcohol.\n\nA knock at the door. He plunged into his papers. \"Come!\" he called.\n\nTetlow thrust in his head. Miss Hallowell did not look up. \"I'm off,\"\nthe head clerk said. His gaze was upon the unconscious girl--a gaze that\nfilled Norman with longing to strangle him.\n\n\"Telegraph me from Albany as soon as you get there,\" said Norman.\n\"Telegraph me at my club.\"\n\nTetlow was gone. The machine tapped monotonously on. The barette which\nheld the girl's hair at the back was so high that the full beauty of the\nnape of her neck was revealed. That wonderful white skin with the golden\ntint! How soft--yet how firm--her flesh looked! How slender yet how\nstrong was her build----\n\n\"How do you like Tetlow?\" he asked, because speak to her he must.\n\nShe glanced up, turned in her chair. He quivered before the gaze from\nthose enchanting eyes of hers. \"I beg pardon,\" she said. \"I didn't\nhear.\"\n\n\"Tetlow--how do you like him?\"\n\n\"He is very kind to me--to everyone.\"\n\n\"How did your father like him?\"\n\nHe confidently expected some sign of confusion, but there was no sign.\n\"Father was delighted with him,\" she said merrily. \"He took an interest\nin the work father's doing--and that was enough.\"\n\nShe was about to turn back to her task. He hastened to ask another\nquestion. \"Couldn't I meet your father some time? What Tetlow told me\ninterested me greatly.\"\n\n\"Father would be awfully pleased,\" replied she. \"But--unless you really\ncare about--biology, I don't think you'd like coming.\"\n\n\"I'm interested in everything interesting,\" replied Norman dizzily. What\nwas he saying? What was he doing? What folly was his madness plunging\nhim into?\n\n\"You can come with Mr. Tetlow when he gets back.\"\n\n\"I'd prefer to talk with him alone,\" said Norman. \"Perhaps I might see\nsome way to be of service to him.\"\n\nHer expression was vividly different from what it had been when he\noffered to help _her_. She became radiant with happiness. \"I do hope\nyou'll come,\" she said--her voice very low and sweet, in the effort she\nwas making to restrain yet express her feelings.\n\n\"When? This evening?\"\n\n\"He's always at home.\"\n\n\"You'll be there?\"\n\n\"I'm always there, too. We have no friends. It's not easy to make\nacquaintances in the East--congenial acquaintances.\"\n\n\"I'd want you to be there,\" he explained with great care, \"because you\ncould help him and me in getting acquainted.\"\n\n\"Oh, he'll talk freely--to anyone. He talks only the one subject. He\nnever thinks of anything else.\"\n\nShe was resting her crossed arms on the back of her chair and, with her\nchin upon them, was looking at him--a childlike pose and a childlike\nexpression. He said: \"You are _sure_ you are twenty?\"\n\nShe smiled gayly. \"Nearly twenty-one.\"\n\n\"Old enough to be in love.\"\n\nShe lifted her head and laughed. She had charming white teeth--small and\nsharp and with enough irregularity to carry out her general suggestion\nof variability. \"Yes, I shall like that, when it comes,\" she said; \"But\nthe chances are against it just now.\"\n\n\"There's Tetlow.\"\n\nShe was much amused. \"Oh, he's far too old and serious.\"\n\nNorman felt depressed. \"Why, he's only thirty-five.\"\n\n\"But I'm not twenty-one,\" she reminded him. \"I'd want some one of my own\nage. I'm tired of being so solemn. If I had love, I'd expect it to\nchange all that.\"\n\nEvidently a forlorn and foolish person--and doubtless thinking of him,\ntwo years the senior of Tetlow and far more serious, as an elderly\nperson, in the same class with her father. \"But you like biology?\" he\nsaid. The way to a cure was to make her talk on.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" said she, looking as frivolous as a\nbutterfly or a breeze-bobbed blossom. \"I listen to father, but it's all\nbeyond me.\"\n\nYes--a light-weight. They could have nothing in common. She was a mere\nsurface--a thrillingly beautiful surface, but not a full-fledged woman.\nSo little did conversation with him interest her, she had taken\nadvantage of the short pause to resume her work. No, she had not the\nfaintest interest in him. It wasn't a trick of coquetry; it was genuine.\nHe whom women had always bowed before was unable to arouse in her a\nspark of interest. She cared neither for what he had nor for what he\nwas, in himself. This offended and wounded him. He struggled sulkily\nwith his papers for half an hour. Then he fell to watching her again\nand----\n\n\"You must not neglect to give me your address,\" he said. \"Write it on a\nslip of paper after you finish. I might forget it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she replied, but did not turn round.\n\n\"Why, do you think, did Tetlow come to see you?\" he asked. He felt\ncheapened in his own eyes--he, the great man, the arrived man, the\nfiance of Josephine Burroughs, engaged in this halting and sneaking\nflirtation! But he could not restrain himself.\n\nShe turned to answer. \"Mr. Tetlow works very hard and has few friends.\nHe had heard of my father and wanted to meet him--just like you.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" murmured Norman, in confusion. \"I thought--perhaps--he was\ninterested in _you_.\"\n\nShe laughed outright--and he had an entrancing view of the clean rosy\ninterior of her mouth. \"In _me_?--Mr. Tetlow? Why, he's too serious and\nimportant for a girl like me.\"\n\n\"Then he bored you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I like him. He is a good man--thoroughly good.\"\n\nThis pleased Norman immensely. It may be fine to be good, but to be\ncalled good--that is somehow a different matter. It removes a man at\nonce from the jealousy-provoking class. \"Good exactly describes him,\"\nsaid Norman. \"He wouldn't harm a fly. In love he'd be ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Not with a woman of his own age and kind,\" protested she. \"But I'm\nneglecting my work.\"\n\nAnd she returned to it with a resolute manner that made him ashamed to\ninterrupt again--especially after the unconscious savage rebukes she had\nadministered. He sat there fighting against the impulse to watch\nher--denouncing himself--appealing to pride, to shame, to prudence--to\nhis love for Josephine--to the sense of decency that restrains a hunter\nfrom aiming at a harmless tame song bird. But all in vain. He\nconcentrated upon her at last, stared miserably at her, filled with\nlonging and dread and shame--and longing, and yet more longing.\n\nWhen she finished and stood at the other side of the desk, waiting for\nhim to pass upon her work, she must have thought he was in a profound\nabstraction. He did not speak, made a slight motion with his hand to\nindicate that she was to go. Shut in alone, he buried his face in his\narms. \"What madness!\" he groaned. \"If I loved her, there'd be some\nexcuse for me. But I don't. I couldn't. Yet I seem ready to ruin\neverything, merely to gratify a selfish whim--an insane whim.\"\n\nOn top of the papers she had left he saw a separate slip. He drew it\ntoward him, spread it out before him. Her address. An unknown street in\nJersey City!\n\n\"I'll not go,\" he said aloud, pushing the slip away. Go? Certainly not.\nHe had never really meant to go. He would, of course, keep his\nengagement with Josephine. \"And I'll not come down town until she has\ntaken another job and has caught Tetlow. I'll stop this idiocy of trying\nto make an impression on a person not worth impressing. What weak\nvanity--to be piqued by this girl's lack of interest!\"\n\nNevertheless--he at six o'clock telephoned to the Burroughs' house that\nhe was detained down town. He sent away his motor, dined alone in the\nstation restaurant in Jersey City. And at half past seven he set out in\na cab in search of--what? He did not dare answer that interrogation.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nLike many another chance explorer from New York, Norman was surprised to\ndiscover that, within a few minutes of leaving the railway station, his\ncab was moving through a not unattractive city. He expected to find the\nHallowells in a tenement in some more or less squalid street overhung\nwith railway smoke and bedaubed with railway grime. He was delighted\nwhen the driver assured him that there was no mistake, that the\ncomfortable little cottage across the width of the sidewalk and a small\nfront yard was the sought-for destination.\n\n\"Wait, please,\" he said to the cabman. \"Or, if you like, you can go to\nthat corner saloon down there. I'll know where to find you.\" And he gave\nhim half a dollar.\n\nThe cabman hesitated between two theories of this conduct--whether it\nwas the generosity it seemed or was a ruse to \"side step\" payment.\nHe--or his thirst--decided for the decency of human nature; he drove\nconfidingly away. Norman went up the tiny stoop and rang. The sound of a\npiano, in the room on the ground floor where there was light, abruptly\nceased. The door opened and Miss Hallowell stood before him. She was\nthroughout a different person from the girl of the office. She had\nchanged to a tight-fitting pale-blue linen dress made all in one piece.\nNorman could now have not an instant's doubt about the genuineness, the\nbewitching actuality, of her beauty. The wonder was how she could\ncontrive to conceal so much of it for the purposes of business. It was a\npeculiar kind of beauty--not the radiant kind, but that which shines\nwith a soft glow and gives him who sees it the delightful sense of being\nits original and sole discoverer. An artistic eye--or an eye that\ndiscriminates in and responds to feminine loveliness--would have been\ncaptivated, as it searched in vain for flaw.\n\nIf Norman anticipated that she would be nervous before the task of\nreceiving in her humbleness so distinguished a visitor, he must have\nbeen straightway disappointed. Whether from a natural lack of that sense\nof social differences which is developed to the most pitiful\nsnobbishness in New York or from her youth and inexperience, she\nreceived him as if he had been one of the neighbors dropping in after\nsupper. And it was Norman who was ill at ease. Nothing is more\ndisconcerting to a man accustomed to be received with due respect to his\nimportance than to find himself put upon the common human level and\ncompelled to \"make good\" all over again from the beginning. He felt--he\nknew--that he was an humble candidate for her favor--a candidate with\nthe chances perhaps against him.\n\nThe tiny parlor had little in it beside the upright piano because there\nwas no space. But the paper, the carpet and curtains, the few pieces of\nfurniture, showed no evidence of bad taste, of painful failure at the\neffort to \"make a front.\" He was in the home of poor people, but they\nwere obviously people who made a highly satisfactory best of their\npoverty. And in the midst of it all the girl shone like the one evening\nstar in the mystic opalescence of twilight.\n\n\"We weren't sure you were coming,\" said she. \"I'll call father. . . .\nNo, I'll take you back to his workshop. He's easier to get acquainted\nwith there.\"\n\n\"Won't you play something for me first? Or--perhaps you sing?\"\n\n\"A very little,\" she admitted. \"Not worth hearing.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'd like it. I want to get used to my surroundings before I\ntackle the--the biology.\"\n\nWithout either hesitation or shyness, she seated herself at the piano.\n\"I'll sing the song I've just learned.\" And she began. Norman moved to\nthe chair that gave him a view of her in profile. For the next five\nminutes he was witness to one of those rare, altogether charming visions\nthat linger in the memory in freshness and fragrance until memory itself\nfades away. She sat very straight at the piano, and the position brought\nout all the long lines of her figure--the long, round white neck and\nthroat, the long back and bosom, the long arms and legs--a series of\nlovely curves. It has been scientifically demonstrated that pale blue is\npre-eminently the sex color. It certainly was pre-eminently _her_ color,\nsetting off each and every one of her charms and suggesting the\nroundness and softness and whiteness her drapery concealed. She was one\nof those rare beings whose every pose is instinct with grace. And her\nvoice--It was small, rather high, at times almost shrill. But in every\nnote of its register there sounded a mysterious, melancholy-sweet call\nto the responding nerves of man.\n\nBefore she got halfway through the song Norman was fighting against the\nsame mad impulse that had all but overwhelmed him as he watched her in\nthe afternoon. And when her last note rose, swelled, slowly faded into\nsilence, it seemed to him that had she kept on for one note more he\nwould have disclosed to her amazed eyes the insanity raging within him.\n\nShe turned on the piano stool, her hands dropped listlessly in her lap.\n\"Aren't those words beautiful?\" she said in a dreamy voice. She was not\nlooking at him. Evidently she was hardly aware of his presence.\n\nHe had not heard a word. He was in no mood for mere words. \"I've never\nliked anything so well,\" he said. And he lowered his eyes that she might\nnot see what they must be revealing.\n\nShe rose. He made a gesture of protest. \"Won't you sing another?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Not after that,\" she said. \"It's the best I know. It has put me out of\nthe mood for the ordinary songs.\"\n\n\"You are a dreamer--aren't you?\"\n\n\"That's my real life,\" replied she. \"I go through the other part just to\nget to the dreams.\"\n\n\"What do you dream?\"\n\nShe laughed carelessly. \"Oh, you'd not be interested. It would seem\nfoolish to you.\"\n\n\"You're mistaken there,\" cried he. \"The only thing that ever has\ninterested me in life is dreams--and making them come true.\"\n\n\"But not _my_ kind of dreams. The only kind I like are the ones that\ncouldn't possibly come true.\"\n\n\"There isn't any dream that can't be made to come true.\"\n\nShe looked at him eagerly. \"You think so?\"\n\n\"The wildest ones are often the easiest.\" He had a moving voice himself,\nand it had been known to affect listening ears hypnotically when he was\ndeeply in earnest, was possessed by one of those desires that conquer\nmen of will and then make them irresistible instruments. \"What is your\ndream?--happiness? . . . love?\"\n\nShe gazed past him with swimming eyes, with a glance that seemed like a\nbrave bright bird exploring infinity. \"Yes,\" she said under her breath.\n\"But it could never--never come true. It's too perfect.\"\n\n\"Don't doubt,\" he said, in a tone that fitted her mood as the rhythm of\nthe cradle fits the gentle breathing of the sleeping child. \"Don't ever\ndoubt. And the dream will come true.\"\n\n\"You have been in love?\" she said, under the spell of his look and tone.\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"I am,\" he replied, and he was under the spell of her\nbeauty.\n\n\"Is it--wonderful?\"\n\n\"Like nothing else on earth. Everything else seems--poor and\ncheap--beside it.\"\n\nHe drew a step nearer. \"But you couldn't love--not yet,\" he said. \"You\nhaven't had the experience. You will have to learn.\"\n\n\"You don't know me,\" she cried. \"I have been teaching myself ever since\nI was a little girl. I've thought of nothing else most of the time.\nOh--\" she clasped her white hands against her small bosom--\"if I ever\nhave the chance, how much I shall give!\"\n\n\"I know it! I know it!\" he replied. \"You will make some man happier than\never man was before.\" His infatuation did not blind him to the fact that\nshe cared nothing about him, looked on him in the most unpersonal way.\nBut that knowledge seemed only to inflame him the more, to lash him on\nto the folly of an ill-timed declaration. \"I have felt how much you will\ngive--how much you will love--I've felt it from the second time I saw\nyou--perhaps from the first. I've never seen any woman who interested me\nas you do--who drew me as you do--against my ambition--against my will.\nI--I----\"\n\nHe had been fighting against the words that would come in spite of him.\nHe halted now because the food of emotion suffocated speech. He stood\nbefore her, ghastly pale and trembling. She did not draw back. She\nseemed compelled by his will, by the force of his passion, to stay where\nshe was. But in her eyes was a fascinated terror--a fear of him--of the\npassion that dominated him, a passion like the devils that made men gash\nthemselves and leap from precipices into the sea. To unaccustomed eyes\nthe first sight of passion is always terrifying and is usually\nrepellent. One must learn to adventure the big wave, the great hissing,\ntowering billow that conceals behind its menace the wild rapture of\ninfinite longing realized.\n\n\"I have frightened you?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" was her whispered reply.\n\n\"But it is your dream come true.\"\n\nShe shrank back--not in aversion, but gently. \"No--it isn't my dream,\"\nshe replied.\n\n\"You don't realize it yet, but you will.\"\n\nShe shook her head positively. \"I couldn't ever think of you in that\nway.\"\n\nHe did not need to ask why. She had already explained when they were\ntalking of Tetlow. There was a finality in her tone that filled him with\ndespair. It was his turn to look at her in terror. What power this slim\ndelicate girl had over him! What a price she could exact if she but\nknew! Knew? Why, he had told her--was telling her in look and tone and\ngesture--was giving himself frankly into captivity--was prostrate,\ninviting her to trample. His only hope of escape lay in her\ninexperience--that she would not realize. In the insanities of passion,\nas in some other forms of dementia, there is always left a streak of\nreason--of that craft which leads us to try to get what we want as\ncheaply as possible. Men, all but beside themselves with love, will\nbargain over the terms, if they be of the bargaining kind by nature.\nNorman was not a haggler. But common prudence was telling him how unwise\nhis conduct was, how he was inviting the defeat of his own purposes.\n\nHe waved his hand impatiently. \"We'll see, my dear,\" he said with a\nlight good-humored laugh. \"I mustn't forget that I came to see your\nfather.\"\n\nShe looked at him doubtfully. She did not understand--did not quite\nlike--this abrupt change of mood. It suggested to her simplicity a lack\nof seriousness, of sincerity. \"Do you really wish to see my father?\" she\ninquired.\n\n\"Why else should I come away over to Jersey City? Couldn't I have talked\nwith you at the office?\"\n\nThis seemed convincing. She continued to study his face for light upon\nthe real character of this strange new sort of man. He regarded her with\na friendly humorous twinkle in his eyes. \"Then I'll take you to him,\"\nshe said at length. She was by no means satisfied, but she could not\ndiscover why she was dissatisfied.\n\n\"I can't possibly do you any harm,\" he urged, with raillery.\n\n\"No, I think not,\" replied she gravely. \"But you mustn't say those\nthings!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Into his eyes came their strongest, most penetrating look. \"I\nwant you. And I don't intend to give you up. It isn't my habit to give\nup. So, sooner or later I get what I go after.\"\n\n\"You make me--afraid,\" she said nervously.\n\n\"Of what?\" laughed he. \"Not of me, certainly. Then it must be of\nyourself. You are afraid you will end by wanting me to want you.\"\n\n\"No--not that,\" declared she, confused by his quick cleverness of\nspeech. \"I don't know what I'm afraid of.\"\n\n\"Then let's go to your father. . . . You'll not tell Tetlow what I've\nsaid?\"\n\n\"No.\" And once more her simple negation gave him a sense of her absolute\ntruthfulness.\n\n\"Or that I've been here?\"\n\nShe looked astonished. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh--office reasons. It wouldn't do for the others to know.\"\n\nShe reflected on this. \"I don't understand,\" was the result of her\nthinking. \"But I'll do as you ask. Only, you must not come again.\"\n\n\"Why not? If they knew at the office, they'd simply talk--unpleasantly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted hesitatingly after reflecting. \"So you mustn't come\nagain. I don't like some kinds of secrets.\"\n\n\"But your father will know,\" he urged. \"Isn't that enough for--for\npropriety?\"\n\n\"I can't explain. I don't understand, myself. I do a lot of things by\ninstinct.\" She, standing with her hands behind her back and with clear,\nchildlike eyes gravely upon him, looked puzzled but resolved. \"And my\ninstinct tells me not to do anything secret about you.\"\n\nThis answer made him wonder whether after all he might not be too\npositive in his derisive disbelief in women's instincts. He laughed.\n\"Well--now for your father.\"\n\nThe workshop proved to be an annex to the rear, reached by a passage\nleading past a cosy little dining room and a kitchen where the order and\nthe shine of cleanness were notable even to masculine eyes. \"You are\nwell taken care of,\" he said to her--she was preceding him to show the\nway.\n\n\"We take care of ourselves,\" replied she. \"I get breakfast before I\nleave and supper after I come home. Father has a cold lunch in the\nmiddle of the day, when he eats at all--which isn't often. And on\nSaturday afternoons and Sundays I do the heavy work.\"\n\n\"You _are_ a busy lady!\"\n\n\"Oh, not so very busy. Father is a crank about system and order. He has\ntaught me to plan everything and work by the plans.\"\n\nFor the first time Norman had a glimmer of real interest in meeting her\nfather. For in those remarks of hers he recognized at once the rare\nsuperior man--the man who works by plan, where the masses of mankind\neither drift helplessly or are propelled by some superior force behind\nthem without which they would be, not the civilized beings they seem,\nbut even as the savage in the dugout or as the beast of the field. The\ngirl opened a door; a bright light streamed into the dim hallway.\n\n\"Father!\" she called. \"Here's Mr. Norman.\"\n\nNorman saw, beyond the exquisite profile of the girl's head and figure,\na lean tallish old man, dark and gray, whose expression proclaimed him\nat first glance no more in touch with the affairs of active life in the\nworld than had he been an inhabitant of Mars.\n\nMr. Hallowell gave his caller a polite glance and handshake--evidence of\nmerest surface interest in him, of amiable patience with an intruder.\nNorman saw in the neatness of his clothing and linen further proof of\nthe girl's loving care. For no such abstracted personality as this would\never bother about such things for himself. These details, however,\ndetained Norman only for a moment. In the presence of Hallowell it was\nimpossible not to concentrate upon him.\n\nAs we grow older what we are inside, the kind of thoughts we admit as\nour intimates, appears ever more strongly in the countenance. This had\noften struck Norman, observing the men of importance about him, noting\nhow as they aged the look of respectability, of intellectual\ndistinction, became a thinner and ever thinner veneer over the\nselfishness and greediness, the vanity and sensuality and falsehood. But\nnever before had he been so deeply impressed by its truth. Evidently\nHallowell during most of his fifty-five or sixty years had lived the\npurely intellectual life. The result was a look of spiritual beauty, the\nlook of the soul living in the high mountain, with serenity and vast\nviews constantly before it. Such a face fills with awe the ordinary\nfollower of the petty life of the world if he have the brains to know or\nto suspect the ultimate truth about existence. It filled Norman with\nawe. He hastily turned his eyes upon the girl--and once more into his\nface came the resolute, intense, white-hot expression of a man doggedly\nset upon an earthy purpose.\n\nThere was an embarrassed silence. Then the girl said, \"Show him the\nworms, father.\"\n\nMr. Hallowell smiled. \"My little girl thinks no one has seen that sort\nof thing,\" said he. \"I can't make her believe it is one of the\ncommonplaces.\"\n\n\"You've never had anyone here more ignorant than I, sir,\" said Norman.\n\"The only claim on your courtesy I can make is that I'm interested and\nthat I perhaps know enough in a general way to appreciate.\"\n\nHallowell waved his hand toward a row of large glass bottles on one of\nthe many shelves built against the rough walls of the room. \"Here they\nare,\" said he. \"It's the familiar illustration of how life may be\ncontrolled.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Norman, eying the bottled worms curiously.\n\n\"Oh, it's simply the demonstration that life is a mere chemical\nprocess----\"\n\nNorman had ceased to listen. The girl was moving toward the door by\nwhich they had entered--was in the doorway--was gone! He stood in an\nattitude of attention; Hallowell talked on and on, passing from one\nthing to another, forgetting his caller and himself, thinking only of\nthe subject, the beloved science, that has brought into the modern world\na type of men like those who haunted the deserts and mountain caves in\nthe days when Rome was falling to pieces. With those saintly hermits of\nthe Dark Ages religion was the all-absorbing subject. And seeking their\nown salvation was the goal upon which their ardent eyes were necessarily\nbent. With these modern devotees, science--the search for the truth\nabout the world in which they live--is their religion; and their goal\nis the redemption of the world. They are resolved--step by step, each\nworker contributing his mite of discovery--to transform the world from a\nhell of discomfort and pain and death to a heaven where men and women,\nfree and enlightened and perhaps immortal, shall live in happiness. They\neven dream that perhaps this race of gods shall learn to construct the\nmeans to take them to another and younger planet, when this Earth has\nbecome too old and too cold and too nakedly clad in atmosphere properly\nto sustain life.\n\nFrom time to time Norman caught a few words of what Hallowell\nsaid--words that made him respect the intelligence that had uttered\nthem. But he neither cared nor dared to listen. He refused to be\ndeflected from his one purpose. When he was as old as Hallowell, it\nwould be time to think of these matters. When he had snatched the things\nhe needed, it would be time to take the generous, wide, philosopher view\nof life. But not yet. He was still young; he could--and he would!--drink\nof the sparkling heady life of the senses, typefied now for him in this\ngirl. How her loveliness flamed in his blood--flamed as fiercely when he\ncould not see the actual, tangible charms as when they were radiating\ntheir fire into his eyes and through his skin! First he must live that\nglorious life of youth, of nerves aquiver with ecstasy. Also, he must\nshut out the things of the intellect--must live in brain as well as in\nbody the animal life--in brain the life of cunning and strategy. For the\nintellectual life would make it impossible to pursue such ignoble\nthings. First, material success and material happiness. Then, in its own\ntime, this intellectual life to which such men as Hallowell ever beckon,\nfrom their heights, such men as Norman, deep in the wallow that seems to\nthem unworthy of them, even as they roll in it.\n\nAs soon as there came a convenient pause in Hallowell's talk, Norman\nsaid, \"And you devote your whole life to these things?\"\n\nHallowell's countenance lost its fine glow of enthusiasm. \"I have to\nmake a living. I do chemical analyses for doctors and druggists. That\ntakes most of my time.\"\n\n\"But you can dispatch those things quickly.\"\n\nHallowell shook his head. \"There's only one way to do things. My clients\ntrust me. I can't shirk.\"\n\nNorman smiled. He admired this simplicity. But it amused him, too; in a\nworld of shirking and shuffling, not to speak of downright dishonesty,\nit struck the humorous note of the incongruous. He said:\n\n\"But if you could give all your time you would get on faster.\"\n\n\"Yes--if I had the time--_and_ the money. To make the search exhaustive\nwould take money--five or six thousand a year, at the least. A great\ndeal more than I shall ever have.\"\n\n\"Have you tried to interest capitalists?\"\n\nHallowell smiled ironically. \"There is much talk about capitalists and\ncapital opening up things. But I have yet to learn of an instance of\ntheir touching anything until they were absolutely sure of large\nprofits. Their failed enterprises are not miscarriage of noble purpose\nbut mistaken judgment, judgment blinded by hope and greed.\"\n\n\"I see that a philosopher can know life without living it,\" said Norman.\n\"But couldn't you put your scheme in such a way that some capitalist\nwould be led to hope?\"\n\n\"I'd have to tell them the truth. Possibly I might discover something\nwith commercial value, but I couldn't promise. I don't think it is\nlikely.\"\n\nNorman's eyes were on the door. His thoughts were reaching out to the\ndistant and faint sound of a piano. \"Just what do you propose to search\nfor?\" inquired he.\n\nHe tried to listen, because it was necessary that he have some knowledge\nof Hallowell's plans. But he could not fix his attention. After a few\nmoments he glanced at his watch, interrupted with, \"I think I understand\nenough for the present. I've stayed longer than I intended. I must go\nnow. When I come again I may perhaps have some plan to propose.\"\n\n\"Plan?\" exclaimed Hallowell, his eyes lighting up.\n\n\"I'm not sure--not at all sure,\" hastily added Norman. \"I don't wish to\ngive you false hopes. The matter is extremely difficult. But I'll try.\nI've small hope of success, but I'll try.\"\n\n\"My daughter didn't explain to me,\" said the scientist. \"She simply said\none of the gentlemen for whom she worked was coming to look at my place.\nI thought it was mere curiosity.\"\n\n\"So it was, Mr. Hallowell,\" said Norman. \"But I have been interested. I\ndon't as yet see what can be done. I'm only saying that I'll think it\nover.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Hallowell. He was trying to seem calm and\nindifferent. But his voice had the tremulous note of excitement in it\nand his hands fumbled nervously, touching evidence of the agitated\ngropings of his mind in the faint, perhaps illusory, light of a\nnew-sprung hope. \"Yes, I understand perfectly. Still--it is pleasant to\nthink about such a thing, even if there's no chance of it. I am very\nfond of dreaming. That has been my life, you know.\"\n\nNorman colored, moved uneasily. The fineness of this man's character\nmade him uncomfortable. He could pity Hallowell as a misguided failure.\nHe could dilate himself as prosperous, successful, much the more\nimposing and important figure in the contrast. Yet there was somehow a\npoint of view at which, if one looked carefully, his own sort of man\nshriveled and the Hallowell sort towered.\n\n\"I _must_ be going,\" Norman said. \"No--don't come with me. I know the way.\nI've interrupted you long enough.\" And he put out his hand and, by those\nlittle clevernesses of manner which he understood so well, made it\nimpossible for Hallowell to go with him to Dorothy.\n\nHe was glad when he shut the door between him and her father. He paused\nin the hall to dispel the vague, self-debasing discomfort--and listening\nto _her_ voice as she sang helped wonderfully. There is no more trying\ntest of a personality than to be estimated by the voice alone. That test\nproduces many strange and startling results. Again and again it\ncompletely reverses our judgment of the personality, either destroys or\nenhances its charm. The voice of this girl, floating out upon the quiet\nof the cottage--the voice, soft and sweet, full of the virginal passion\nof dreams unmarred by experience--It was while listening to her voice,\nas he stood there in the dimly lighted hall, that Frederick Norman\npassed under the spell in all its potency. In taking an anaesthetic\nthere is the stage when we reach out for its soothing effects; then\ncomes the stage when we half desire, half fear; then a stage in which\nfear is dominant, and we struggle to retain our control of the senses.\nLast comes the stage when we feel the full power of the drug and relax\nand yield or are beaten down into quiet. Her voice drew him into the\nfinal stage, was the blow of the overwhelming wave's crest that crushed\nhim into submission.\n\nShe glanced toward the door. He was leaning there, an ominous calm in\nhis pale, resolute face. She gazed at him with widening eyes. And her\nlook was the look of helplessness before a force that may, indeed must,\nbe struggled against, but with the foregone certainty of defeat.\n\nA gleam of triumph shone in his eyes. Then his expression changed to one\nmore conventional. \"I stopped a moment to listen, on my way out,\" said\nhe.\n\nHer expression changed also. The instinctive, probably unconscious\nresponse to his look faded into the sweet smile, serious rather than\nmerry, that was her habitual greeting. \"Mr. Tetlow didn't get away from\nfather so soon.\"\n\n\"I stayed longer than I intended. I found it even more interesting than\nI had expected. . . . Would you be glad if your father could be free to\ndo as he likes and not be worried about anything?\"\n\n\"That is one of my dreams.\"\n\n\"Well, it's certainly one that might come true. . . . And you--It's a\nshame that you should have to do so much drudgery--both here and in New\nYork.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind about myself. It's all I'm fit for. I haven't any\ntalent--except for dreaming.\"\n\n\"And for making--_some_ man's dreams come true.\"\n\nHer gaze dropped. And as she hid herself she looked once more almost as\ninsignificant and colorless as he had once believed her to be.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly without raising her eyes or emerging from the\ndeep recess of her reserve.\n\n\"You are a mystery to me. I can't decide whether you are very innocent\nor very--concealing.\"\n\nShe glanced inquiringly at him. \"I don't understand,\" she said.\n\nHe smiled. \"No more do I. I've seen so much of faking--in women as well\nas in men--that it's hard for me to believe anyone is genuine.\"\n\n\"Do you think I am trying to deceive you? About what?\"\n\nHe made an impatient gesture--impatience with his credulity where she\nwas concerned. \"No matter. I want to make you happy--because I want you\nto make me happy.\"\n\nHer eyes became as grave as a wondering child's. \"You are laughing at\nme,\" she said.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"Because I could not make you happy.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"What could a serious man like you find in me?\"\n\nHis intense, burning gaze held hers. \"Some time I will tell you.\"\n\nShe shut herself within herself like a flower folding away its beauty\nand leaving exposed only the underside of its petals. It was impossible\nto say whether she understood or was merely obeying an instinct.\n\nHe watched her a moment in silence. Then he said:\n\n\"I am mad about you--mad. You _must_ understand. I can think only of you.\nI am insane with jealousy of you. I want you--I must have you.\"\n\nHe would have seized her in his arms, but the look of sheer amazement\nshe gave him protected her where no protest or struggle would. \"You?\"\nshe said. \"Did you really mean it? I thought you were just talking.\"\n\n\"Can't you see that I mean it?\"\n\n\"Yes--you look as if you did. But I can't believe it. I could never\nthink of you in that way.\"\n\nOnce more that frank statement of indifference infuriated him. He _must_\ncompel her to feel--he must give that indifference the lie--and at once!\nHe caught her in his arms. He rained kisses upon her pale face. She made\nnot the least resistance, but seemed dazed. \"I will teach you to love\nme,\" he cried, drunk now with the wine of her lips, with the perfume of\nher exquisite youth. \"I will make you happy. We shall be mad with\nhappiness.\"\n\nShe gently freed herself. \"I don't believe I could ever think of you in\nthat way.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling--you will. You can't help loving where you are loved so\nutterly.\"\n\nShe gazed at him wonderingly--the puzzled wonder of a child.\n\"You--love--me?\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Call it what you like. I am mad about you. I have forgotten\neverything--pride--position--things you can't imagine--and I care for\nnothing but you.\"\n\nAnd again he was kissing her with the soft fury of fire; and again she\nwas submitting with the passive, dazed expression that seemed to add to\nhis passion. To make her feel! To make her respond! He, whom so many\nwomen had loved--women of position, of fame for beauty, of social\ndistinction or distinction as singers, players--women of society and\nwomen of talent all kinds of worth-while women--they had cared, had run\nafter him, had given freely all he had asked and more. And this\ngirl--nobody at all--she had nothing for him.\n\nHe held her away from him, cried angrily: \"What is the matter with you?\nWhat is the matter with me?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"I wish you wouldn't kiss me so much.\"\n\nHe released her, laughed satirically. \"Oh--you are playing a game. I\nmight have known.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said she. \"A while ago you said you loved me. Now\nyou act as if you didn't like me at all.\" And she smiled gayly at him,\npouting her lips a little. Once more her beauty was shining. It made his\nnerves quiver to see the color in her pure white skin where he had\nkissed her.\n\n\"I don't care whether it is a game or not,\" he cried. And he was about\nto seize her again, when she repulsed him. He crushed her resistance,\nheld her tight in his arms.\n\n\"You frighten me,\" she murmured. \"You--hurt me.\"\n\nHe released her. \"What do you want?\" he cried. \"Don't you care at all?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I like you--very much. I have from the first time I saw you.\nBut you seem older--and more serious.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that. We are going to love each other--and I am going\nto make you and your father happy.\"\n\n\"If you make father happy I will do anything for you. I don't want\nanything myself--but he is getting old and sometimes his despair is\nterrible.\" There were tears in her voice--tears and the most touching\ntenderness. \"He has some great secret that he wants to discover, and he\nis afraid he will die without having had the chance.\"\n\n\"You will love me if I make your father happy?\"\n\nHe knew it was the question of a fool, but he so longed to hear from her\nlips some word to give him hope that he could not help asking it. She\nsaid:\n\n\"Love you as--as you seem to love me? Not that same way. I don't feel\nthat way toward you. But I will love you in my own way.\"\n\nHe observed her with penetrating eyes. Was this speech of hers innocence\nor calculation? He could get no clue to the truth. He saw nothing but\ninnocence; the teaching of experience warned him to believe in nothing\nbut guile. He hid his doubt and chagrin behind a mocking smile. \"As you\nplease,\" said he. \"I will do my part. Then--we'll see. . . . Do you care\nabout anyone else--in _my_ way of loving, I mean?\"\n\nIt was again the question of an infatuated fool, and put in an\ninfatuated fool's way. For, if she were a \"deep one,\" how could he hope\nto get the truth? But her answer reassured him. \"No,\" she said--her\nsimple, direct negation that had a convincing power he had never seen\nequaled.\n\n\"If I ever knew of another man's touching you,\" he said, \"I'd feel like\nstrangling him.\" He laughed at himself. \"Not that I should strangle him.\nThat sort of thing isn't done any more. But I'd do something devilish.\"\n\n\"But I haven't promised not to kiss anyone else,\" she said. \"Why should\nI? I don't love you.\"\n\nHe looked at her strangely. \"But you're going to love me,\" he said.\n\nShe shrank within herself again. She looked at him with uneasy eyes.\n\"You won't kiss me any more until I tell you that I do love you?\" she\nasked with the gravity and pathos and helplessness of a child.\n\n\"Don't you want to learn to love me?--to learn to love?\"\n\nShe was silent--a silence that maddened him.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to speak,\" he said irritably. \"What are you thinking?\"\n\n\"That I don't want you to kiss me--and that I do want father to be\nhappy.\"\n\nWas this guile? Was it innocence? He put his arms round her. \"Look at\nme,\" he said.\n\nShe gazed at him frankly.\n\n\"You like me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why don't you want me to kiss you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It makes me--dislike you.\"\n\nHe released her. She laid her hand on his arm eagerly. \"Please--\" she\nimplored. \"I don't mean to hurt you. I wouldn't offend you for anything.\nOnly--when you ask me a question--mustn't I tell you the truth?\"\n\n\"Always,\" he said, believing in her, in spite of the warnings of cynical\nworldliness. \"I don't know whether you are sincere or not--as yet. So\nfor the present I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.\" He stood back\nand looked at her from head to foot. \"You are beautiful!--perfect,\" he\nsaid in a low voice. He laughed. \"I'll resist the temptation to kiss you\nagain. I must go now. About your father--I'll see what can be done.\"\n\nShe stood with her hands behind her back, looking up at him with an\nexpression he could not fathom. Suddenly she advanced, put up her lips\nand said gravely,\n\n\"Won't you kiss me?\"\n\nHe eyed her quizzically. \"Oh--you've changed your mind?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Then why do you ask me to kiss you?\"\n\n\"Because of what you said about father.\"\n\nHe laughed and kissed her. And then she, too, laughed. He said, \"Not for\nmy own sake--not a little bit?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she cried, \"when you kiss me that way. I like to be kissed. I\nam very affectionate.\"\n\nHe laughed again. \"You _are_ a queer one. If it's a game, it's a good one.\nIs it a game?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said she gayly. \"Good night. This is dreadfully late for\nme.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" he said, and they shook hands. \"Do you like me better--or\nless?\"\n\n\"Better,\" was her prompt, apparently honest reply.\n\n\"Curiously enough, I'm beginning to _like_ you,\" said he. \"Now don't ask\nme what I mean by that. If you don't know already, you'll not find out\nfrom me.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I do know,\" cried she. \"The way you kissed me--that was one\nthing. The way you feel toward me now--that's a different thing. Isn't\nit so?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I see we are going to get on.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\nThey shook hands again in friendliest fashion, and she opened the front\ndoor for him. And her farewell smile was bright and happy.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nIn the cold clear open he proceeded to take the usual account of\nstock--with dismal results. She had wound him round her fingers, had\nmade him say only the things he should not have said, and leave unsaid\nthe things that might have furthered his purposes. He had conducted the\naffair ridiculously--\"just what is to be expected of an infatuated\nfool.\" However, there was no consolation in the discovery that he was\nreduced, after all these years of experience, to the common level--man\nweak and credulous in his dealings with woman. He hoped that his disgust\nwith himself would lead on to disgust, or, rather, distaste for her. It\nis the primal instinct of vanity to dislike and to shun those who have\nwitnessed its humiliation.\n\n\"I believe I am coming to my senses,\" he said. And he ventured to call\nher up before him for examination and criticism. This as he stood upon\nthe forward deck of the ferry with the magnificent panorama of New York\nbefore him. New York! And he, of its strong men, of the few in all that\nmultitude who had rank and power--he who had won as his promised wife\nthe daughter of one of the dozen mighty ones of the nation! What an\nill-timed, what an absurd, what a crazy step down this excursion of\nhis! And for what? There he summoned her before him. And at the first\nglance of his fancy at her fair sweet face and lovely figure, he\nquailed. He was hearing her voice again. He was feeling the yield of her\nsmooth, round form to his embrace, the yield of her smooth white cheek\nto his caress. In his nostrils was the fragrance of her youth, the\nmatchless perfume of nature, beyond any of the distillations of art in\nits appeal to his normal and healthy nerves. And he burned with the fire\nonly she could quench. \"I must--I must.--My God, I _must_!\" he muttered.\n\nWhen he reached home, he asked whether his sister was in. The butler\nsaid that Mrs. Fitzhugh had just come from the theater. In search of\nher, he went to the library, found her seated there with a book and a\ncigarette, her wrap thrown back upon her chair. \"Come out to supper with\nme, Ursula,\" he said. \"I'm starved and bored.\"\n\n\"Why, you're not dressed!\" exclaimed his sister. \"I thought you were at\nthe Cameron dance with Josephine.\"\n\n\"Had to cut it out,\" replied he curtly. \"Will you come?\"\n\n\"I can't eat, but I'll drink. Yes, let's have a spree. It's been years\nsince we had one--not since we were poor. Let's not go to a _deadly_\nrespectable place. Let's go where there are some of the other kind,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"But I must have food. Why not the Martin?\"\n\n\"That'll do--though I'd prefer something a little farther up Broadway.\"\n\n\"The Martin is gay enough. The truth is, there's nothing really gay any\nmore. There's too much money. Money suffocates gayety.\"\n\nTo the Martin they went, and he ordered an enormous supper--one of those\nincredible meals for which he was famous. They dispatched a quart of\nchampagne before the supper began to come, he drinking at least two\nthirds of it. He drank as much while he was eating--and called for a\nthird bottle when the coffee was served. He had eaten half a dozen big\noysters, a whole guinea hen, a whole portion of salad, another of\nBoniface cheese, with innumerable crackers.\n\n\"If I could eat as you do!\" sighed Ursula enviously. \"Yet it's only one\nof your accomplishments.\"\n\n\"I'm not eating much nowadays,\" said he gloomily. \"I'm losing my\nappetite.\" And he lit a long black cigar and swallowed half a large\nglass of the champagne. \"Nothing tastes good--not even champagne.\"\n\n\"There _is_ something wrong with you,\" said Ursula. \"Did you ask me out\nfor confidences, or for advice--or for both?\"\n\n\"None of them,\" replied he. \"Only for company. I knew I'd not be able to\nsleep for hours, and I wanted to put off the time when I'd be alone.\"\n\n\"I wish I had as much influence with you as you have with me,\" said\nUrsula, by way of preparation for confidences.\n\n\"Influence? Don't I do whatever you say?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Nobody has influence over you,\" she said.\n\n\"Not even myself,\" replied he morosely.\n\n\"Well--that talking-to you gave me has had its effect,\" proceeded Mrs.\nFitzhugh. \"It set me to thinking. There are other things besides\nlove--man and woman love. I've decided to--to behave myself and give\npoor Clayton a chance to rest.\" She smiled, a little maliciously. \"He's\nhad a horrible fright. But it's over now. What a fine thing it is for a\nwoman to have a sensible brother!\"\n\nNorman grunted, took another liberal draught of the champagne.\n\n\"If I had a mind like yours!\" pursued Ursula. \"Now, you simply couldn't\nmake a fool of yourself.\"\n\nHe looked at her sharply. He felt as if she had somehow got wind of his\neccentric doings.\n\n\"I've always resented your rather contemptuous attitude toward women,\"\nshe went on. \"But you are right--really you are. We're none of us worth\nthe excitement men make about us.\"\n\n\"It isn't the woman who makes a fool of the man,\" said Norman. \"It's the\nman who makes a fool of himself. A match can cause a terrific explosion\nif it's in the right place--but not if it isn't.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That's it. We're simply matches--and most of us of the\npoor sputtering kind that burns with a bad odor and goes out right away.\nA very inferior quality of matches.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Norman, \"it's the man who does the whole business.\"\n\nA mocking smile curled her lips. \"I knew you weren't in love with\nJosephine.\"\n\nHe stared gloomily at his cigar.\n\n\"But you're going to marry her?\"\n\n\"I'm in love with her,\" he said angrily. \"And I'm going to marry her.\"\n\nShe eyed him shrewdly. \"Fred--are you in love with some one else?\"\n\nHe did not answer immediately. When he did it was with a \"No\" that\nseemed the more emphatic for the delay.\n\n\"Oh, just one of your little affairs.\" And she began to poke fun at him.\n\"I thought you had dropped that sort of thing for good and all. I hope\nJosie won't hear of it. She'd not understand. Women never do--unless\nthey don't care a rap about the man. . . . Is she on the stage? I know\nyou'll not tell me, but I like to ask.\"\n\nHer brother looked at her rather wildly. \"Let's go home,\" he said. He\nwas astounded and alarmed by the discovery that his infatuation had\nwhirled him to the lunacy of longing to confide--and he feared lest, if\nhe should stay on, he would blurt out his disgraceful secret. \"Waiter,\nthe bill.\"\n\n\"Don't let's go yet,\" urged his sister. \"The most interesting people are\nbeginning to come. Besides, I want more champagne.\"\n\nHe yielded. While she gazed round with the air of a visitor to a Zoo\nthat is affected by fashionable people, and commented on the faces,\nfigures, and clothes of the women, he stared at his plate and smoked and\ndrank. Finally she said, \"I'd give anything to see you make a fool of\nyourself, just once.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Things are in the way to having your wish gratified,\" he\nsaid. \"It looks to me as if my time had come.\"\n\nShe tried to conceal her anxiety. \"Are you serious?\" she asked. Then\nadded: \"Of course not. You simply couldn't. Especially now--when\nJosephine might hear. I suppose you've noticed how Joe Culver is hanging\nround her?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"There's no danger--unless----\"\n\n\"I shall marry Josephine.\"\n\n\"Not if she hears.\"\n\n\"She's not going to hear.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure. Women love to boast. It tickles their vanity to have\na man. Yes, they pretend to be madly in love simply to give themselves\nthe excuse for tattling.\"\n\n\"She'll not hear.\"\n\n\"You can't be sure.\"\n\n\"I want you to help me out. I'm going to tell her I'm tremendously busy\nthese few next days--or weeks.\"\n\n\"Weeks!\" Ursula Fitzhugh laughed. \"My, it must be serious!\"\n\n\"Weeks,\" repeated her brother. \"And I want you to say things that'll\nhelp out--and to see a good deal of her.\" He flung down his cigar. \"You\nwomen don't understand how it is with a man.\"\n\n\"Don't we though! Why, it's a very ordinary occurrence for a woman to be\nreally in love with several men at once.\"\n\nHis eyes gleamed jealously. \"I don't believe it,\" he cried.\n\n\"Not Josephine,\" she said reassuringly. \"She's one of those\nsingle-hearted, untemperamental women. They concentrate. They have no\nimagination.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of Josephine,\" said he sullenly. \"To go back to what\nI was saying, I am in love with Josephine and with no one else. I can't\nexplain to you how or why I'm entangled. But I'll get myself untangled\nall right--and very shortly.\"\n\n\"I know that, Fred. You aren't the permanent damn-fool sort.\"\n\n\"I should say not!\" exclaimed he. \"It's a hopeful sign that I know\nexactly how big a fool I am.\"\n\nShe shook her head in strong dissent. \"On the contrary,\" said she,\n\"it's a bad sign. I didn't realize I was making a fool of myself until\nyou pointed it out to me. That stopped me. If I had been doing it with\nmy eyes open, your jacking me up would only have made me go ahead.\"\n\n\"A woman's different. It doesn't take much to stop a woman. She's about\nhalf stopped when she begins.\"\n\nUrsula was thoroughly alarmed. \"Fred,\" she said earnestly, \"you're\nrunning bang into danger. The time to stop is right now.\"\n\n\"Can't do it,\" he said. \"Let's not talk about it.\"\n\n\"Can't? That word from _you_?\"\n\n\"From me,\" replied he. \"Don't forget helping out with Josephine. Let's\ngo.\"\n\nAnd he refused to be persuaded to stay on--or to be cajoled or baited\ninto talking further of this secret his sister saw was weighing heavily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was down town half an hour earlier than usual the next morning. But\nno one noted it because his habit had always been to arrive among the\nfirst--not to set an example but to give his prodigious industry the\nfullest swing. There was in Turkey a great poet of whom it is said that\nhe must have written twenty-five hours a day. Norman's accomplishment\nbulked in that same way before his associates. He had not slept the\nwhole night. But, thanks to his enormous vitality, no trace of this\nserious dissipation showed. The huge supper he had eaten--and drunk--the\nsleepless night and the giant breakfast of fruit and cereal and chops\nand wheat cakes and coffee he had laid in to stay him until lunch time,\nwould together have given pause to any but such a physical organization\nas his. The only evidence of it was a certain slight irritability--but\nthis may have been due to his state of intense self-dissatisfaction.\n\nAs he entered the main room his glance sought the corner where Miss\nHallowell was ensconced. She happened to look up at that instant. With a\nradiant smile she bowed to him in friendliest fashion. He colored\ndeeply, frowned with annoyance, bowed coldly and strode into his room.\nHe fussed and fretted about with his papers for a few minutes, then rang\nthe bell.\n\n\"Send in Miss Pritchard--no, Mr. Gowdy--no, Miss Hallowell,\" he said to\nthe office boy. And then he looked sharply at the pert young face for\npossible signs of secret cynical amusement. He saw none such, but was\nnot convinced. He knew too well how by a sort of occult process the\nservants, all the subordinates, round a person like himself discover the\nmost intimate secrets, almost get the news before anything has really\noccurred.\n\nMiss Hallowell appeared, and very cold and reserved she looked as she\nstood waiting.\n\n\"I sent for you because--\" he began. He glanced at the door to make sure\nthat it was closed--\"because I wanted to hear your voice.\" And he\nlaughed boyishly. He was in high good humor now.\n\n\"Why did you speak to me as you did when you came in?\" said she.\n\nThere was certainly novelty in this direct attack, this equal to equal\ncriticism of his manners. He was not pleased with the novelty; but at\nthe same time he felt a lack of the courage to answer her as she\ndeserved, even if she was playing a clever game. \"It isn't necessary\nthat the whole office should know our private business,\" said he.\n\nShe seemed astonished. \"What private business?\"\n\n\"Last night,\" said he, uncertain whether she was trifling with him or\nwas really the innocent she pretended to be. \"If I were you, I'd not\nspeak as friendlily as you did this morning--not before people.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired she, her sweet young face still more perplexed.\n\n\"This isn't a small town out West,\" explained he. \"It's New York. People\nmisunderstand--or rather--\" He gave her a laughing, mischievous\nglance--\"or rather--they don't.\"\n\n\"I can't see anything to make a mystery about,\" declared the girl. \"Why,\nyou act as if there were something to be ashamed of in coming to see\nme.\"\n\nHe was observing her sharply. How could a girl live in the New York\natmosphere several years without getting a sensible point of view? Yet,\nso far as he could judge, this girl was perfectly honest in her\nignorance. \"Don't be foolish,\" said he. \"Please accept the fact as I\ngive it to you. You mustn't let people see everything.\"\n\nShe made no attempt to conceal her dislike for this. \"I won't be mixed\nup in anything like that,\" said she, quite gently and without a\nsuggestion of pique or anger. \"It makes me feel low--and it's horribly\ncommon. Either we are going to be friends or we aren't. And if we are,\nwhy, we're friends whenever we meet. I'm not ashamed of you. And if you\nare ashamed of me, you can cut me out altogether.\"\n\nHis color deepened until his face was crimson. His eyes avoided hers. \"I\nwas thinking chiefly of you,\" he said--and he honestly thought he was\nspeaking the whole truth.\n\n\"Then please don't do so any more,\" said she, turning to go. \"I\nunderstand about New York snobbishness. I want nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHe disregarded the danger of the door being opened at any moment. He\nrushed to her and took her reluctant hand. \"You mustn't blame me for the\nways of the world. I can't change them. Do be sensible, dearest. You're\nonly going to be here a few days longer. I've got that plan for you and\nyour father all thought out. I'll put it through at once. I don't want\nthe office talking scandal about us--do you?\"\n\nShe looked at him pityingly. His eyes fell before hers. \"I know it's a\nweakness,\" he said, giving up trying to deceive her and himself. \"But I\ncan't help it. I was brought up that way.\"\n\n\"Well--I wasn't. I see we can never be friends.\"\n\nWhat a mess he had made of this affair! This girl must be playing upon\nhim. In his folly he had let her see how completely he was in her power,\nand she was using that power to establish relations between them that\nwere the very opposite of what he desired--and must have. He must\ncontrol himself. \"As you please,\" he said coldly, dropping her hand.\n\"I'm sorry, but unless you are reasonable I can do nothing for you.\" And\nhe went to his desk.\n\nShe hesitated a moment; as her back was toward him, he could not see her\nexpression. Without looking round she went out of his office. It took\nall his strength to let her go. \"She's bluffing,\" he muttered. \"And\nyet--perhaps she isn't. There may be people like that left in New York.\"\nWhatever the truth, he simply must make a stand. He knew women; no woman\nhad the least respect for a man who let her rule--and this woman,\nrelying upon his weakness for her, was bent upon ruling. If he did not\nmake a stand, she was lost to him. If he did make a stand, he could no\nmore than lose her. Lose her! That thought made him sick at heart. \"What\na fool I am about her!\" he cried. \"I must hurry things up. I must get\nenough of her--must get through it and back to my sober senses.\"\n\nThat was a time of heavy pressure of important affairs. He furiously\nattacked one task after another, only to abandon each in turn. His mind,\nwhich had always been his obedient, very humble servant, absolutely\nrefused to obey. He turned everything over to his associates or to\nsubordinates, fighting all morning against the longing to send for her.\nAt half past twelve he strode out of the office, putting on the air of\nthe big man absorbed in big affairs. He descended to the street. But\ninstead of going up town to keep an appointment at a business lunch he\nhung round the entrance to the opposite building.\n\nShe did not appear until one o'clock. Then out she came--with the head\noffice boy!--the good-looking, young head office boy.\n\nNorman's contempt for himself there reached its lowest ebb. For his\nblood boiled with jealousy--jealousy of his head office boy!--and about\nan obscure little typewriter! He followed the two, keeping to the other\nside of the street. Doubtless those who saw and recognized him fancied\nhim deep in thought about some mighty problem of corporate law or\npolicy, as he moved from and to some meeting with the great men who\ndictated to a nation of ninety millions what they should buy and how\nmuch they should pay for it. He saw the two enter a quick-lunch\nrestaurant--struggled with a crack-brained impulse to join them--dragged\nhimself away to his appointment.\n\nHe was never too amiable in dealing with his clients, because he had\nfound that, in self-protection, to avoid being misunderstood and largely\nincreasing the difficulties of amicable intercourse, he must keep the\nfeel of iron very near the surface. That day he was for the first time\nirascible. If the business his clients were engaged in had been less\nperilous and his acute intelligence not indispensable, he would have\ncost the firm dear. But in business circles, where every consideration\nyields to that of material gain, the man with the brain may conduct\nhimself as he pleases--and usually does so, when he has strength of\ncharacter.\n\nAll afternoon he wrestled with himself to keep away from the office. He\nwon, but it was the sort of victory that gives the winner the chagrin\nand despondency of defeat. At home, late in the afternoon, he found\nJosephine in the doorway, just leaving. \"You'll walk home with me--won't\nyou?\" she said. And, taken unawares and intimidated by guilt, he could\nthink of no excuse.\n\nSome one--probably a Frenchman--has said that there are always in a\nman's life three women--the one on the way out, the one that is, and the\none that is to be. Norman--ever the industrious trafficker with the\nfeminine that the man of the intense vitality necessary to a great\ncareer of action is apt to be--was by no means new to the situation in\nwhich he now found himself. But never before had the circumstances been\nso difficult. Josephine in no way resembled any woman with whom he had\nbeen involved; she was the first he had taken seriously. Nor did the\nother woman resemble the central figure in any of his affairs. He did\nnot know what she was like, how to classify her; but he did know that\nshe was unlike any woman he had ever known and that his feeling for her\nwas different--appallingly different--from any emotion any other woman\nhad inspired in him. So--a walk alone with Josephine--a first talk with\nher after his secret treachery--was no light matter. \"Deeper and\ndeeper,\" he said to himself. \"Where is this going to end?\"\n\nShe began by sympathizing with him for having so much to do--\"and father\nsays you can get through more work than any man he ever knew, not\nexcluding himself.\" She was full of tenderness and compliment, of a kind\nof love that made him feel as the dirt beneath his feet. She respected\nhim so highly; she believed in him so entirely. The thought of her\ndiscovering the truth, or any part of it, gave him a sensation of\nnausea. He was watching her out of the corner of his eye. Never had he\nseen her more statelily beautiful. If he should lose her! \"I'm\nmad--_mad_!\" he said to himself.\n\n\"Josephine is as high above her as heaven above earth. What is there to\nher, anyhow? Not brains--nor taste--nor such miraculous beauty. Why do\nI make an ass of myself about her? I ought to go to my doctor.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you're listening to what I'm saying,\" laughed\nJosephine.\n\n\"My head's in a terrible state,\" replied he. \"I can't think of\nanything.\"\n\n\"Don't try to talk or to listen, dearest,\" said she in the sweet and\nsoothing tone that is neither sweet nor soothing to a man in a certain\nspecies of unresponsive mood. \"This air will do you good. It doesn't\nannoy you for me to talk to you, does it?\"\n\nThe question was one of those which confidently expects, even demands, a\nsincere and strenuous negative for answer. It fretted him, this\nmatter-of-course assumption of hers that she could not but be altogether\npleasing, not to say enchanting to him. Her position, her wealth, the\nattentions she had received, the flatteries--In her circumstances could\nit be in human nature not to think extremely well of oneself? And he\nadmitted that she had the right so to think. Still--For the first time\nshe scraped upon his nerves. His reply, \"Annoy me? The contrary,\" was\ndistinctly crisp. To an experienced ear there would have sounded the\nfaint warning under-note of sullenness.\n\nBut she, believing in his love and in herself, saw nothing, suspected\nnothing. \"We know each other so thoroughly,\" she went on, \"that we don't\nneed to make any effort. How congenial we are! I always understand you.\nI feel such a sense of the perfect freedom and perfect frankness between\nus. Don't you?\"\n\n\"You have wonderful intuitions,\" said he.\n\nIt was the time to alarm him by coldness, by capriciousness. But how\ncould she know it? And she was in love--really in love--not with\nherself, not with love, but with him. Thus, she made the mistake of all\ntrue lovers in those difficult moments. She let him see how absolutely\nshe was his. Nor did the spectacle of her sincerity, of her belief in\nhis sincerity put him in any better humor with himself.\n\nThe walk was a mere matter of a dozen blocks. He thought it would never\nend. \"You are sure you aren't ill?\" she said, when they were at her\ndoor--a superb bronze door it was, opening into a house of the splendor\nthat for the acclimated New Yorker quite conceals and more than\ncompensates absence of individual taste. \"You don't look ill. But you\nact queerly.\"\n\n\"I'm often this way when they drive me too hard down town.\"\n\nShe looked at him with fond admiration; he might have been better\npleased had there not been in the look a suggestion of the possessive.\n\"How they do need you! Father says--But I mustn't make you any vainer\nthan you are.\"\n\nHe usually loved compliment, could take it in its rawest form with fine\nhuman gusto. Now, he did not care enough about that \"father says\" to\nrise to her obvious bait. \"I'm horribly tired,\" he said. \"Shall I see\nyou to-morrow? No, I guess not--not for several days. You understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied she. \"I'll miss you dreadfully, but my father has\ntrained me well. I know I mustn't be selfish--and tempt you to neglect\nthings.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he. \"I must be off.\"\n\n\"You'll come in--just a moment?\" Her eyes sparkled. \"The butler will\nhave sense enough to go straight away--and the small reception room will\nbe quite empty as usual.\"\n\nHe could not escape. A few seconds and he was alone with her in the\nlittle room--how often had he--they--been glad of its quiet and\nseclusion on such occasions! She laid her hand upon his shoulders, gazed\nat him proudly. \"It was here,\" said she, \"that you first kissed me. Do\nyou remember?\"\n\nTo take her gaze from his face and to avoid seeing her look of loving\ntrust, he put his arms round her. \"I don't deserve you,\" he said--one of\nthose empty pretenses of confession that yet give the human soul a sense\nof truthfulness.\n\n\"You'd not say that if you knew how happy you make me,\" murmured she.\n\nThe welcome sound of a step in the hall give him his release. When he\nwas in the street, he wiped his hot face with his handkerchief. \"And I\nthought I had no moral sense left!\" he reflected--not the first man, in\nthis climax day of the triumph of selfish philosophies, to be astonished\nby the discovery that the dead hands of heredity and tradition have a\npower that can successfully defy reason.\n\nHe started to walk back home, on impulse took a passing taxi and went to\nhis club. It was the Federal. They said of it that no man who amounted\nto anything in New York could be elected a member, because any man on\nhis way up could not but offend one or more of the important persons in\ncontrol. Most of its members were nominated at birth or in childhood and\nelected as soon as they were twenty-one. Norman was elected after he\nbecame a man of consequence. He regarded it as one of the signal\ntriumphs of his career; and beyond question it was proof of his power,\nof the eagerness of important men, despite their jealousy, to please him\nand to be in a position to get the benefit of his brains should need\narise. Norman's whole career, like every career great and small, in the\narena of action, was a derision of the ancient moralities, a\ndemonstration of the value of fear as an aid to success. Even his\nfriends--and he had as many as he cared to have--had been drawn to him\nby the desire to placate him, to stand well where there was danger in\nstanding ill.\n\nUntil dinner time he stood at the club bar, drinking one cocktail after\nanother with that supreme indifference to consequences to health which\nmade his fellow men gape and wonder--and cost an occasional imitator\nhealth, and perhaps life. Nor did the powerful liquor have the least\neffect upon him, apparently. Possibly he was in a better humor, but not\nnoticeably so. He dined at the club and spent the evening at bridge,\nwinning several hundred dollars. He enjoyed the consideration he\nreceived at that club, for his fellow members being men of both social\nand financial consequence, their conspicuous respect for him was a\nconcentrated essence of general adulation. He lingered on, eating a\ngreat supper with real appetite. He went home in high good humor with\nhimself. He felt that he was a conqueror born, that such things of his\ndesire as did not come could be forced to come. He no longer regarded\nhis passion for the nebulous girl of many personalities as a descent\nfrom dignity. Was he not king? Did not his favor give her whatever rank\nhe pleased? Might not a king pick and choose, according to his fancy?\nLet the smaller fry grow nervous about these matters of caste. They did\nwell to take care lest they should fall. But not he! He had won thus far\nby haughtiness, never by cringing. His mortal day would be that in which\nhe should abandon his natural tactics for the modes of lesser men. True,\nonly a strong head could remain steady in these giddy altitudes of\nself-confidence. But was not his head strong?\n\nAnd without hesitation he called up the vision that made him\ndelirious-and detained it and reveled in it until sleep came.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThe longer he thought of it the stronger grew his doubt that the little\nHallowell girl could be so indifferent to him as she seemed. Not that\nshe was a fraud--that is, a conscious fraud--even so much of a fraud as\nthe sincerest of the other women he had known. Simply that she was\ncarrying out a scheme of coquetry. Could it be in human nature, even in\nthe nature of the most indiscriminating of the specimens of young\nfeminine ignorance and folly, not to be flattered by the favor of such a\nman as he? Common sense answered that it could not be--but neglected to\npoint out to him that almost any vagary might be expected of human\nnature, when it could produce such a deviation from the recognized types\nas a man of his position agitated about such an unsought obscurity as\nMiss Hallowell. He continued to debate the state of her mind as if it\nwere an affair of mightiest moment--which, indeed, it was to him. And\npresently his doubt strengthened into conviction. She must be secretly\npleased, flattered, responsive. She had been in the office long enough\nto be impressed by his position. Yes, there must be more or less\npretense in her apparently complete indifference--more or less pretense,\nmore or less coquetry, probably not a little timidity.\n\nShe would come down from her high horse--with help and encouragement\nfrom him. He was impatient to get to the office and see just how she\nwould do it--what absurd, amusing attractive child's trick she would\nthink out, imagining she could fool him, as lesser intelligences are\never fatuously imagining they can outwit greater.\n\nHe rather thought she would come in to see him on some pretext, would\nmaneuver round like a bird pretending to flutter away from the trap it\nhas every intention of entering. But eleven o'clock of a wasted morning\ncame and she did not appear. He went out to see if she was there--she\nmust be sick; she could not be there or he would have heard from her. . . .\nYes, she was at her desk, exactly as always. No, not exactly the same.\nShe was obviously attractive now; the air of insignificance had gone,\nand not the dullest eyes in that office could fail to see at least\nsomething of her beauty. And Tetlow was hanging over her, while the\ngirls and boys grinned and whispered. Clearly, the office was \"on to\"\nTetlow. . . . Norman, erect and coldly infuriate, called out:\n\n\"Mr. Tetlow--one moment, please.\"\n\nHe went back to his den, Tetlow startling and following like one on the\nway to the bar for sentence. \"Mr. Tetlow,\" he said, when they were shut\nin together, \"you are making a fool of yourself before the whole\noffice.\"\n\n\"Be a little patient with me, Mr. Norman,\" said the head clerk humbly.\n\"I've got another place for her. She's going to take it to-morrow.\nThen--there'll be no more trouble.\"\n\nNorman paled. \"She wishes to leave?\" he contrived to articulate.\n\n\"She spoke to me about leaving before I told her I had found her another\njob.\"\n\nNorman debated--but for only a moment. \"I do not wish her to leave,\" he\nsaid coldly. \"I find her useful and most trustworthy.\"\n\nTetlow's eyes were fixed strangely upon him.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked Norman, the under-note of danger but\nthinly covered.\n\n\"Then she was right,\" said Tetlow slowly. \"I thought she was mistaken. I\nsee that she is right.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Norman--a mere inquiry, devoid of bluster or\nany other form of nervousness.\n\n\"You know very well what I mean, Fred Norman,\" said Tetlow. \"And you\nought to be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\n\"Don't stand there scowling and grimacing like an idiot,\" said Norman\nwith an amused smile. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"She told me--about your coming to see her--about your offer to do\nsomething for her father--about your acting in a way that made her\nuneasy.\"\n\nFor an instant Norman was panic-stricken. Then his estimate of her\nreassured him. \"I took your advice,\" said he. \"I went to see for myself.\nHow did I act that she was made uneasy?\"\n\n\"She didn't say. But a woman can tell what a man has in the back of his\nhead--when it concerns her. And she is a good woman--so innocent that\nyou ought to be ashamed of yourself for even thinking of her in that\nway. God has given innocence instincts, and she felt what you were\nabout.\"\n\nNorman laughed--a deliberate provocation. \"Love has made a fool of you,\nold man,\" he said.\n\n\"I notice you don't deny,\" retorted Tetlow shrewdly.\n\n\"Deny what? There's nothing to deny.\" He felt secure now that he knew\nshe had been reticent with Tetlow as to the happenings in the cottage.\n\n\"Maybe I'm wronging you,\" said Tetlow, but not in the tone of belief.\n\"However that may be, I know you'll not refuse to listen to my appeal. I\nlove her, Norman. I'm going to make her my wife if I can. And I ask\nyou--for the sake of our old friendship--to let her alone. I've no\ndoubt you could dazzle her. You couldn't make a bad woman of her. But\nyou could make her very miserable.\"\n\nNorman pushed about the papers before him. His face wore a cynical\nsmile; but Tetlow, who knew him in all his moods, saw that he was deeply\nagitated.\n\n\"I don't know that I can win her, Fred,\" he pleaded. \"But I feel that I\nmight if I had a fair chance.\"\n\n\"You think she'd refuse _you_?\" said Norman.\n\n\"Like a flash, unless I'd made her care for me. That's the kind she is.\"\n\n\"That sounds absurd. Why, there isn't a woman in New York who would\nrefuse a chance to take a high jump up.\"\n\n\"I'd have said so, too. But since I've gotten acquainted with her I've\nlearned better. She may be spoiled some day, but she hasn't been yet.\nGod knows, I wish I could tempt her. But I can't.\"\n\n\"You're entirely too credulous, old man. She'll make a fool of you.\"\n\n\"I know better,\" Tetlow stubbornly maintained. \"Anyhow, I don't care. I\nlove her, and I'd marry her, no matter what her reason for marrying me\nwas.\"\n\nWhat pitiful infatuation!--worse than his own. Poor Tetlow!--he deserved\na better fate than to be drawn into this girl's trap--for, of course,\nshe never could care for such a heavy citizen--heavy and homely--the\nloosely fat kind of homely that is admired by no one, not even by a\nwoman with no eye at all for the physical points of the male. It would\nbe a real kindness to save worthy Tetlow. What a fool she'd make of\nhim!--how she'd squander his money--and torment him with jealousy--and\nunfit him for his career. Poor Tetlow! If he could get what he wanted,\nhe'd be well punished for his imprudence in wanting it. Really, could\nfriendship do him a greater service than to save him?\n\nNorman gave Tetlow a friendly, humorous glance. \"You're a hopeless case,\nBilly,\" he said. \"But at least don't rush into trouble. Take your time.\nYou can always get in, you know; and you may not get in quite so deep.\"\n\n\"You promise to let her alone?\" said Tetlow eagerly.\n\nAgain his distinguished friend laughed. \"Don't be an ass, old man. Why\nimagine that, just because you've taken a fancy to a girl, everyone\nwants her?\" He clapped him on the shoulder, gave him a push toward the\ndoor. \"I've wasted enough time on this nonsense.\"\n\nTetlow did not venture to disregard a hint so plain. He went with his\ndoubt still unsolved--his doubt whether his jealousy was right or his\nhigh opinion of his hero friend whose series of ever-mounting successes\nhad filled him with adoration. He knew the way of success, knew no man\ncould tread it unless he had, or acquired, a certain hardness of heart\nthat made him an uncomfortable not to say dangerous associate. He\nregretted his own inability to acquire that indispensable hardness, and\nenvied and admired it in Fred Norman. But, at the same time that he\nadmired, he could not help distrusting.\n\nNorman battled with his insanity an hour, then sent for Miss Hallowell.\n\nThe girl had lost her look of strength and vitality. She seemed frail\nand dim--so unimportant physically that he wondered why her charm for\nhim persisted. Yet it did persist. If he could take her in his arms,\ncould make her drooping beauty revive!--through love for him if\npossible; if not, then through anger and hate! He must make her feel,\nmust make her acknowledge, that he had power. It seemed to him another\ninstance of the resistless fascination which the unattainable, however\nunworthy, has ever had for the conqueror temperament.\n\n\"You are leaving?\" he said curtly, both a question and an affirmation.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are making a mistake--a serious mistake.\"\n\nShe stood before him listlessly, as if she had no interest either in\nwhat he was saying or in him. That maddening indifference!\n\n\"It was a mistake to tattle your trouble to Tetlow.\"\n\n\"I did not tattle,\" said she quietly, colorlessly. \"I said only enough\nto make him help me.\"\n\n\"And what did he say about me?\"\n\n\"That I had misjudged you--that I must be mistaken.\"\n\nNorman laughed. \"How seriously the little people of the world do take\nthemselves!\"\n\nShe looked at him. His amused eyes met hers frankly. \"You didn't mean\nit?\" she said.\n\nHe beamed on her. \"Certainly I did. But I'm not a lunatic or a wild\nbeast. Do you think I would take advantage of a girl in your position?\"\n\nHer eyes seemed to grow large and weary, and an expression of experience\nstole over her young face, giving it a strange appearance of\nage-in-youth. \"It has been done,\" said she.\n\nHow reconcile such a look with the theory of her childlike innocence?\nBut then how reconcile any two of the many varied personalities he had\nseen in her? He said: \"Yes--it has been done. But not by me. I shall\ntake from you only what you gladly give.\"\n\n\"You will get nothing else,\" said she with quiet strength.\n\n\"That being settled--\" he went on, holding up a small package of papers\nbound together by an elastic--\"Here are the proposed articles of\nincorporation of the Chemical Research Company. How do you like the\nname?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The company that is to back your father. Capital stock, twenty-five\nthousand dollars, one half paid up. Your father to be employed as\ndirector of the laboratories at five thousand a year, with a fund of ten\nthousand to draw upon. You to be employed as secretary and treasurer at\nfifteen hundred a year. I will take the paid-up stock, and your father\nand you will have the privilege of buying it back at par within five\nyears. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"I think I understand,\" was her unexpected reply. Her replies were\nusually unexpected, like the expressions of her face and figure; she was\ncontinually comprehending where one would have said she would not, and\nnot comprehending where it seemed absurd that she should not. \"Yes, I\nunderstand. . . . What else?\"\n\n\"Nothing else.\"\n\nShe looked intently at him, and her eyes seemed to be reading his soul\nto the bottom.\n\n\"Nothing else,\" he repeated.\n\n\"No obligation--for money--or--for anything?\"\n\n\"No obligation. A hope perhaps.\" He was smiling with the gayest good\nhumor. \"But not the kind of hope that ever becomes a disagreeable demand\nfor payment.\"\n\nShe seated herself, her hands in her lap, her eyes down--a lovely\npicture of pensive repose. He waited patiently, feasting his senses upon\nher delicate, aromatic loveliness. At last she said:\n\n\"I accept.\"\n\nHe had anticipated an argument. This promptness took him by surprise. He\nfelt called upon to explain, to excuse her acceptance. \"I am taking a\nlittle flyer--making a gamble,\" said he. \"Your father may turn up\nnothing of commercial value. Again the company may pay big----\"\n\nShe gave him a long look through half-closed eyes, a queer smile\nflitting round her lips. \"I understand perfectly why you are doing it,\"\nshe said. \"Do you understand why I am accepting?\"\n\n\"Why should you refuse?\" rejoined he. \"It is a good business prop----\"\n\n\"You know very well why I should refuse. But--\" She gave a quiet laugh\nof experience; it made him feel that she was making a fool of him--\"I\nshall not refuse. I am able to take care of myself. And I want father to\nhave his chance. Of course, I shan't explain to him.\" She gave him a\nmischievous glance. \"And I don't think _you_ will.\"\n\nHe contrived to cover his anger, doubt, chagrin, general feeling of\nhaving been outwitted. \"No, I shan't tell him,\" laughed he. \"You are\nmaking a great fool of me.\"\n\n\"Do you want to back out?\"\n\nWhat audacity! He hesitated--did not dare. Her indifference to him--her\npersonal, her physical indifference gave her the mastery. His teeth\nclenched and his passion blazed in his eyes as he said: \"No--you witch!\nI'll see it through.\"\n\nShe smiled lightly. \"I suppose you'll come to the offices of the\ncompany--occasionally?\" She drew nearer, stood at the corner of the\ndesk. Into her exquisite eyes came a look of tenderness. \"And I shall be\nglad to see you.\"\n\n\"You mean that?\" he said, despising himself for his humble eagerness,\nand hating her even as he loved her.\n\n\"Indeed I do.\" She smiled bewitchingly. \"You are a lot better man than\nyou think.\"\n\n\"I am an awful fool about you,\" retorted he. \"You see, I play my game\nwith all my cards on the table. I wish I could say the same of you.\"\n\n\"I am not playing a game,\" replied she. \"You make a mystery where there\nisn't any. And--all your cards aren't on the table.\" She laughed\nmockingly. \"At least, you think there's one that isn't--though, really,\nit is.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"About your engagement.\"\n\nHe covered superbly. \"Oh,\" said he in the most indifferent tone. \"Tetlow\ntold you.\"\n\n\"As soon as I heard that,\" she went on, \"I felt better about you. I\nunderstand how it is with men--the passing fancies they have for\nwomen.\"\n\n\"How did you learn?\" demanded he.\n\n\"Do you think a girl could spend several years knocking about down town\nin New York without getting experience?\"\n\nHe smiled--a forced smile of raillery, hiding sudden fierce suspicion\nand jealousy. \"I should say not. But you always pretend innocence.\"\n\n\"I can't be held responsible for what you read into my looks and into\nwhat I say,\" observed she with her air of a wise old infant. \"But I was\nso glad to find out that you were seriously in love with a nice girl up\ntown.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing. She gazed at him in childlike surprise. \"Why are\nyou laughing at me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing,\" he assured her. He would have found it difficult to\nexplain why he was so intensely amused at hearing the grand Josephine\nBurroughs called \"a nice girl up town.\"\n\n\"You are in love with her? You are engaged to her?\" she inquired, her\ngrave eyes upon him with an irresistible appeal for truth in them.\n\n\"Tetlow didn't lie to you,\" evaded he. \"You don't know it, but Tetlow is\ngoing to ask you to marry him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew,\" replied she indifferently.\n\n\"How? Did he tell you?\"\n\n\"No. Just as I knew you were not going to ask me to marry you.\"\n\nThe mere phrase, even when stated as a negation, gave him a sensation of\nice suddenly laid against the heart.\n\n\"It's quite easy to tell the difference between the two kinds of\nmen--those that care for me more than they care for themselves and those\nthat care for themselves more than they care for me.\"\n\n\"That's the way it looks to you--is it?\"\n\n\"That's the way it is,\" said she.\n\n\"There are some things you don't understand. This is one of them.\"\n\n\"Maybe I don't,\" said she. \"But I've my own idea--and I'm going to stick\nto it.\"\n\nThis amused him. \"You are a very opinionated and self-confident young\nlady,\" said he.\n\nShe laughed roguishly. \"I'm taking up a lot of your time.\"\n\n\"Don't think of it. You haven't asked when the new deal is to begin.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--and I shall have to tell Mr. Tetlow I'm not taking the place\nhe got for me.\"\n\n\"Be careful what you say to him,\" cautioned Norman. \"You must see it\nwouldn't be well to tell him what you are going to do. There's no reason\non earth why he should know your business--is there?\"\n\nShe did not reply; she was reflecting.\n\n\"You are not thinking of marrying Tetlow--are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I don't love him--and couldn't learn to.\"\n\nWith a sincerely judicial air, now that he felt secure, he said: \"Why\nnot? It would be a good match.\"\n\n\"I don't love him,\" she repeated, as if that were a sufficient and\ncomplete answer. And he was astonished to find that he so regarded it,\nalso, in spite of every assault of all that his training had taught him\nto regard as common sense about human nature.\n\n\"You can simply say to Tetlow that you've decided to stay at home and\ntake care of your father. The offices of the company will be at your\nhouse. Your official duties practically amount to taking care of your\nfather. So you'll be speaking the truth.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't exactly lying, to keep something from somebody who has no\nright to know it. What you suggest isn't quite the truth. But it's near\nenough, and I'll say it to him.\"\n\nHis own view of lying was the same as that she had expressed. Also, he\nhad no squeamishness about saying what was in no sense true, if the\nfalsehood were necessary to his purposes. Yet her statement of her code,\nmoral though he thought it and eminently sensible as well, lowered her\nonce more in his estimation. He was eager to find reason or plausible\nexcuse for believing her morally other and less than she seemed to be.\nImmediately the prospects of his ultimate projects--whatever they might\nprove to be--took on a more hopeful air. \"And I'd advise you to have\nTetlow keep away from you. We don't want him nosing round.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said she. \"He is a nice man, but tiresome. And if I\nencouraged him ever so little, he'd be sentimental. The most tiresome\nthing in the world to a girl is a man who talks that sort of thing when\nshe doesn't want to hear it--from him.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Meaning me?\" he suggested.\n\nShe nodded, much pleased. \"Perhaps,\" she replied.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" mocked he.\n\n\"I shan't till I have to,\" she assured him. \"And I don't think I'll have\nto.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the Monday morning following, Tetlow came in to see Norman as soon as\nhe arrived. \"I want a two weeks' leave,\" he said. \"I'm going to Bermuda\nor down there somewhere.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" cried Norman. \"You do look ill, old man.\"\n\n\"I saw her last night,\" replied the chief clerk, dropping an effort at\nconcealing his dejection. \"She--she turned me down.\"\n\n\"Really? You?\" Norman's tone of sympathetic surprise would not have\ndeceived half attentive ears. But Tetlow was securely absorbed. \"Why,\nBilly, she can't hope to make as good a match.\"\n\n\"That's what I told her--when I saw the game was going against me. But\nit was no use.\"\n\nNorman trifled nervously with the papers before him. Presently he said,\n\"Is it some one else?\"\n\nTetlow shook his head.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because she said so,\" replied the head clerk.\n\n\"Oh--if she said so, that settles it,\" said Norman with raillery.\n\n\"She's given up work--thank God,\" pursued Tetlow. \"She's getting more\nbeautiful all the time--Norman, if you had seen her last night, you'd\nunderstand why I'm stark mad about her.\"\n\nNorman's eyes were down. His hands, the muscles of his jaw were\nclinched.\n\n\"But, I mustn't think of that,\" Tetlow went on. \"As I was about to say,\nif she were to stay on in the offices some one--some attractive man like\nyou, only with the heart of a scoundrel----\"\n\nNorman laughed cynically.\n\n\"Yes, a scoundrel!\" reiterated the fat head-clerk. \"Some scoundrel would\ntempt her beyond her power to resist. Money and clothes and luxury will\ndo anything. We all get to be harlots here in New York. Some of us know\nit, and some don't. But we all look it and act it. And she'd go the way\nof the rest--with or without marriage. It's just as well she didn't\nmarry me. I know what'd have become of her.\"\n\nNorman nodded.\n\nTetlow gave a weary sigh. \"Anyhow, she's safe at home with her father.\nHe's found a backer for his experiments.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said Norman.\n\n\"You can spare me for ten days,\" Tetlow went on. \"I'd be of no use if I\nstayed.\"\n\nThere was a depth of misery in his kind gray eyes that moved Norman to\nget up and lay a friendly hand on his shoulder. \"It's the best thing,\nold man. She wasn't for you.\"\n\nTetlow dropped into a chair and sobbed. \"It has killed me,\" he groaned.\n\"I don't mean I'll commit suicide or die. I mean I'm dead inside--dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Billy--where's your good sense?\"\n\n\"I know what I'm talking about,\" said he. \"Norman, God help the man who\nmeets the woman he really wants--God help him if she doesn't want him.\nYou don't understand. You'll never have the experience. Any woman you\nwanted would be sure to want you.\"\n\nNorman, his hand still on Tetlow's shoulder, was staring ahead with a\nterrible expression upon his strong features.\n\n\"If she could see the inside of me--the part that's the real me--I think\nshe would love me--or learn to love me. But she can only see the\noutside--this homely face and body of mine. It's horrible, Fred--to have\na mind and a heart fit for love and for being loved, and an outside that\nrepels it. And how many of us poor devils of that sort there are--men\nand women both!\"\n\nNorman was at the window now, his back to the room, to his friend. After\na while Tetlow rose and made a feeble effort to straighten himself. \"Is\nit all right about the vacation?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Norman, without turning.\n\n\"Thank you, Fred. You're a good friend.\"\n\n\"I'll see you before you go,\" said Norman, still facing the window.\n\"You'll come back all right.\"\n\nTetlow did not answer. When Norman turned he was alone.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIn no way was Norman's luck superior to most men's more splendidly than\nin that his inborn tendency to arrogant and extravagant desires was\nmatched by an inborn capacity to get the necessary money. His luxurious\ntastes were certainly not moderated by his associations--enormously rich\npeople who, while they could be stingy enough in some respects, at the\nsame time could and did fling away fortunes in gratifying selfish\nwhims--for silly showy houses, for retinues of wasteful servants, for\ngewgaws that accentuated the homeliness of their homely women and\ncoarsened and vulgarized their pretty women--or perhaps for a night's\ngambling or entertaining, or for the forced smiles and contemptuous\ncaresses of some belle of the other world. Norman fortunately cared not\nat all for the hugely expensive pomp of the life of the rich; if he had,\nhe would have hopelessly involved himself, as after all he was not a\nmoney-grubber but a lawyer. But when there appeared anything for which\nhe did care, he was ready to bid for it like the richest of the rich.\n\nTherefore the investment of a few thousand dollars seemed a small matter\nto him. He had many a time tossed away far more for far less. He did not\ndole out the sum he had agreed to provide. He paid it into the Jersey\nCity bank to the credit of the Chemical Research Company and informed\nits secretary and treasurer that she could draw freely against it. \"If\nyou will read the by-laws of the company,\" said he, \"you will see that\nyou've the right to spend exactly as you see fit. When the money runs\nlow, let me know.\"\n\n\"I'll be very careful,\" said Dorothea Hallowell, secretary and\ntreasurer.\n\n\"That's precisely what we don't want,\" replied he. He glanced round the\ntiny parlor of the cottage. \"We want everything to be run in first-class\nshape. That's the only way to get results. First of all, you must take a\nproper house--a good-sized one, with large grounds--room for building\nyour father a proper laboratory.\"\n\nHer dazed and dazzled expression delighted him.\n\n\"And you must live better. You must keep at least two servants.\"\n\n\"But we can't afford it.\"\n\n\"Your father has five thousand a year. You have fifteen hundred. That\nmakes sixty-five hundred. The rent of the house and the wages and keep\nof the servants are a charge against the corporation. So, you can well\nafford to make yourselves comfortable.\"\n\n\"I haven't got used to the idea as yet,\" said Dorothea. \"Yes--we _are_\nbetter off than we were.\"\n\n\"And you must live better. I want you to get some clothes--and things of\nthat sort.\"\n\nShe shrank within herself and sat quiet, her gaze fixed upon her hands\nlying limp in her lap.\n\n\"There is no reason why your father shouldn't be made absolutely\ncomfortable and happy. That's the way to get the best results from a man\nof his sort.\"\n\nShe faded on toward the self-effacing blank he had first known.\n\n\"Think it out, Dorothy,\" he said in his frankest, kindliest way. \"You'll\nsee I'm right.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.\n\n\"No? What does that mean?\"\n\n\"I've an instinct against it,\" replied she. \"I'd rather father and I\nkept on as we are.\"\n\n\"But that's impossible. You've no right to live in this small, cramping\nway. You must broaden out and give _him_ room to grow. . . . Isn't that\nsensible?\"\n\n\"It sounds so,\" she admitted. \"But--\" She gazed round helplessly--\"I'm\nafraid!\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Then don't bother about it.\"\n\n\"I'll have to be very--careful,\" she said thoughtfully.\n\n\"As you please,\" replied he. \"Only, don't live and think on a\nten-dollar-a-week basis. That isn't the way to get on.\"\n\nHe never again brought up the matter in direct form. But most of his\nconversation was indirect and more or less subtle suggestions as to ways\nof branching out. She moved cautiously for a few days, then timidly\nbegan to spend money.\n\nThere is a notion widely spread abroad that people who have little money\nknow more about the art of spending money and the science of economizing\nthan those who have much. It would be about as sensible to say that the\nbest swimmers are those who have never been near the water, or no nearer\nthan a bath tub. Anyone wishing to be convinced need only make an\nexcursion into the poor tenement district and observe the garbage\nbarrels overflowing with spoiled food--or the trashy goods exposed for\nsale in the shops and the markets. Those who have had money and have\nlost it are probably, as a rule, the wisest in thrift. Those who have\nnever had money are almost invariably prodigal--because they are\nignorant. When Dorothea Hallowell was a baby the family had had money.\nBut never since she could remember had they been anything but poor.\n\nShe did not know how to spend money. She did not know prices or\nvalues--being in that respect precisely like the mass of mankind--and\nwomankind--who imagine they are economical because they hunt so-called\nbargains and haggle with merchants who have got doubly ready for them by\nlaying in inferior goods and by putting up prices in advance. She knew\nhow much ten dollars a week was, the meaning of the twenty to thirty\ndollars a week her father had made. But she had only a faint--and\nexaggeratedly mistaken--notion about sixty-five hundred a year--six and\na half thousands. It seemed wealth to her, so vast that a hundred\nthousand a year would have seemed no more. As soon as she drifted away\nfrom the known course--the thirty to forty dollars a week upon which\nthey had been living--Dorothea Hallowell was in a trackless sea, with a\nbroken compass and no chart whatever. A common enough experience in\nAmerica, the land of sudden changes of fortune, of rosiest hopes about\n\"striking it rich,\" of carelessness and ignorance as to values, of eager\nand untrained appetite for luxury and novelty of any and every kind.\n\nAt first any expenditure, however small, for the plainest comfort which\nhad been beyond their means seemed a giddy extravagance. But a bank\naccount--_and_ a check book--soon dissipated that nervousness. A few\ncharge accounts, a little practice in the simple easy gesture of drawing\na check, and she was almost at her ease. With people who have known only\nsqualor or with those who have earned their better fortune by privation\nand slow accumulation, the spreading out process is usually slow--not so\nslow as it used to be when our merchants had not learned the art of\ntempting any and every kind of human nature, but still far from rapid. A\npiece of money reminds them vividly and painfully of the toil put into\nacquiring it; and they shy away from the pitfall of the facile check.\nWith those born and bred as Dorothy was and elevated into what seems to\nthem affluence by no effort of their own, the spreading is a tropical,\novernight affair.\n\nCounting all she spent and arranged to spend in those first few weeks,\nyou had no great total. But it was great for a girl who had been making\nten dollars a week. Also there were sown in her mind broadcast and thick\nthe seeds of desire for more luxurious comfort, of need for it, that\ncould never be uprooted.\n\nNorman came over almost every evening. He got a new and youthful and\nyouth-restoring kind of pleasure out of this process of expansion. He\nliked to hear each trifling detail, and he was always making suggestions\nthat bore immediate fruit in further expenditure. When he again brought\nup the subject of a larger house, she listened with only the faintest\nprotests. Her ideas of such a short time before seemed small, laughably\nsmall now. \"Father was worrying only this morning because he is so\ncramped,\" she admitted.\n\n\"We must remedy that at once,\" said Norman.\n\n[Illustration: \"'It has killed me,' he groaned.\"]\n\nAnd on the following Sunday he and she went house hunting. They found a\nsatisfactory place--peculiarly satisfactory to Norman because it was\nnear the Hudson tunnel, and so only a few minutes from his office. To\nDorothy it loomed a mansion, almost a palace. In fact it was a modestly\nroomy old-fashioned brick house, with a brick stable at the side that,\nwith a little changing, would make an admirable laboratory.\n\n\"You haven't the time--or the experience--to fit this place up,\" said\nNorman. \"I'll attend to it--that is, I'll have it attended to.\" Seeing\nher uneasy expression, he added: \"I can get much better terms. They'd\ncertainly overcharge you. There's no sense in wasting money--is there?\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted, convinced.\n\nHe gave the order to a firm of decorators. It was a moderate order,\nconsidering the amount of work that had to be done. But if the girl had\nseen the estimates Norman indorsed, she would have been terrified.\nHowever, he saw to it that she did not see them; and she, ignorant of\nvalues, believed him when he told her the general account of the\ncorporation must be charged with two thousand dollars.\n\nHer alarm took him by surprise. The sum seemed small to him--and it was\nonly about one fifth what the alterations and improvements had cost.\nCried she, \"Why, that's more than our whole income for a year has been!\"\n\n\"You are forgetting these improvements add to the value of the property.\nI've bought it.\"\n\nThat quieted her. \"You are sure you didn't pay those decorators and\nfurnishers too much?\" said she.\n\n\"You don't like their work?\" inquired he, chagrined.\n\n\"Oh, yes--yes, indeed,\" she assured him. \"I like plain, solid-looking\nthings. But--two thousand dollars is a lot of money.\"\n\nNorman regretted that, as his whole object had been to please her, he\nhad not ordered the more showy cheaper stuff but had insisted upon the\nsimplest, plainest-looking appointments throughout. Even her bedroom\nfurniture, even her dressing table set, was of the kind that suggests\ncost only to the experienced, carefully and well educated in values and\nin taste.\n\n\"But I'm sure it isn't fair to charge _all_ these things to the company,\"\nshe protested. \"I can't allow it. Not the things for my personal use.\"\n\n\"You _are_ a fierce watchdog of a treasurer,\" said Norman, laughing at her\nbut noting and respecting the fine instinct of good breeding shown in\nher absence of greediness, of desire to get all she could. \"But I'm\nletting the firm of decorators take over what you leave behind in the\nold house. I'll see what they'll allow for it. Maybe that will cover the\nexpense you object to.\"\n\nThis contented her. Nor was she in the least suspicious when he\nannounced that the decorators had made such a liberal allowance that the\ndeficit was but three hundred dollars. \"Those chaps,\" he explained,\n\"have a wide margin of profit. Besides, they're eager to get more and\nbigger work from me.\"\n\nA few weeks, and he was enjoying the sight of her ensconced with her\nfather in luxurious comfort--with two servants, with a well-run house,\nwith pleasant gardens, with all that is at the command of an income of\nsix thousand a year in a comparatively inexpensive city. Only\noccasionally--and then not deeply--was he troubled by the reflection\nthat he was still far from his goal--and had made apparently absurdly\nlittle progress toward it through all this maneuvering. The truth was,\nhe preferred to linger when lingering gave him so many new kinds of\npleasure. Of those in the large and motley company that sit down to the\nbanquet of the senses, the most are crude, if not coarse, gluttons. They\neat fast and furiously, having a raw appetite. Now and then there is one\nwho has some idea of the art of enjoyment--the art of prolonging and\nvarying both the joys of anticipation and the joys of realization.\n\nHe turned his attention to tempting her to extravagance in dress. But\nhis success there was not all he could have wished. She wore better\nclothes--much better. She no longer looked the poor working girl,\nstruggling desperately to be neat and clean. She had almost immediately\ntaken on the air of the comfortable classes. But everything she got for\nherself was inexpensive and she made dresses for herself, and trimmed\nall her hats. With the hats Norman found no fault. There her good taste\nproduced about as satisfactory results as could have been got at the\nfashionable milliners--more satisfactory than are got by the women who\ngo there, with no taste of their own beyond a hazy idea that they want\n\"something like what Mrs. So-and-So is wearing.\" But homemade dresses\nwere a different matter.\n\nNorman longed to have her in toilettes that would bring out the full\nbeauty of her marvelous figure. He, after the manner of the more\nintelligent and worldly-wise New York men, had some knowledge of\nwomen's clothes. His sister knew how to dress; Josephine knew how,\nthough her taste was somewhat too sober to suit Norman--at least to suit\nhim in Dorothy. He thought out and suggested dresses to Dorothy, and\ntold her where to get them. Dorothy tried to carry out at home such of\nhis suggestions as pleased her--for, like all women, she believed she\nknew how to dress herself. Her handiwork was creditable. It would have\ncontented a less exacting and less trained taste than Norman's. It would\nhave contented him had he not been infatuated with her beauty of face\nand form. As it was, the improvement in her appearance only served to\nintensify his agitation. He now saw in her not only all that had first\nconquered him, but also those unsuspected beauties and graces--and\npossibilities of beauty and grace yet more entrancing, were she but\ndressed properly.\n\n\"You don't begin to appreciate how beautiful you are,\" said he. It had\never been one of his rules in dealing with women to feed their physical\nvanity sparingly and cautiously, lest it should blaze up into one of\nthose consuming flames that produce a very frenzy of conceit. But this\nrule, like all the others, had gone by the board. He could not conceal\nhis infatuation from her, not even when he saw that it was turning her\nhead and making his task harder and harder. \"If you would only go over\nto New York to several dressmakers whose names I'll give you, I know\nyou'd get clothes from them that you could touch up into something\nuncommon.\"\n\n\"I can't afford it,\" said she. \"What I have is good enough--and costs\nmore than I've the right to pay.\" And her tone silenced him; it was the\ntone of finality, and he had discovered that she had a will.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever before had Frederick Norman let any important thing drift. And\nwhen he started in with Dorothy he had no idea of changing that fixed\npolicy. He would have scoffed if anyone had foretold to him that he\nwould permit the days and the weeks to go by with nothing definite\naccomplished toward any definite purpose. Yet that was what occurred.\nEvery time he came he had in mind a fixed resolve to make distinct\nprogress with the girl. Every time he left he had a furious quarrel with\nhimself for his weakness. \"She is making a fool of me,\" he said to\nhimself. \"She _must_ be laughing at me.\" But he returned only to repeat\nhis folly, to add one more to the lengthening, mocking series of lost\nopportunities.\n\nThe truth lay deeper than he saw. He recognized only his own weakness of\nthe infatuated lover's fatuous timidity. He did not realize how potent\nher charm for him was, how completely content she made him when he was\nwith her, just from the fact that they were together. After a time an\nunsatisfied passion often thus diffuses itself, ceases to be a narrow\ntorrent, becomes a broad river whose resistless force is hidden beneath\nan appearance of sparkling calm. Her ingenuousness amused him; her\ndeveloping taste and imagination interested him; her freshness, her\nfreedom from any sense of his importance in the world fascinated him,\nand there was a keener pleasure than he dreamed in the novel sensation\nof breathing the perfume of what he, the one time cynic, would have\nstaked his life on being unsullied purity. Their relations were to him a\ndelightful variation upon the intimacy of master and pupil. Either he\nwas listening to her or was answering her questions--and the time flew.\nAnd there never was a moment when he could have introduced the subject\nthat most concerned him when he was not with her. To have introduced it\nwould have been rudely to break the charm of a happy afternoon or\nevening.\n\nWas she leading him on and on nowhere deliberately? Or was it the sweet\nand innocent simplicity it seemed? He could not tell. He would have\nbroken the charm and put the matter to the test had he not been afraid\nof the consequences. What had he to fear? Was she not in his power? Was\nshe not his, whenever he should stretch forth his hand and claim her?\nYes--no doubt--not the slightest doubt. But--He was afraid to break\nthe charm; it was such a satisfying charm.\n\nThen--there was her father.\n\nMen who arrive anywhere in any direction always have the habit of\nignoring the nonessential more or less strongly developed. One\nreason--perhaps the chief reason--why Norman had got up to the high\nplaces of material success at so early an age was that he had an\nunerring instinct for the essential and wasted no time or energy upon\nthe nonessential. In his present situation Dorothy's father, the\nabstracted man of science, was one of the factors that obviously fell\ninto the nonessential class. Norman knew little about him, and cared\nless. Also, he took care to avoid knowing him. Knowing the father would\nopen up possibilities of discomfort--But, being a wise young man,\nNorman gave this matter the least possible thought.\n\nStill, it was necessary that the two men see something of each other.\nHallowell discovered nothing about Norman, not enough about his personal\nappearance to have recognized him in the street far enough away from the\nlaboratory to dissociate the two ideas. Human beings--except his\ndaughter--did not interest Hallowell; and his feeling for her was\nsomewhat in the nature of an abstraction. Norman, on the other hand, was\nintensely interested in human beings; indeed, he was interested in\nlittle else. He was always thrusting through surfaces, probing into\nminds and souls. He sought thoroughly to understand the living machines\nhe used in furthering his ambitions and desires. So it was not long\nbefore he learned much about old Newton Hallowell--and began to admire\nhim--and with a man of Norman's temperament to admire is to like.\n\nHe had assumed at the outset that the scientist was more or less the\ncrank. He had not talked with him many times before he discovered that,\nfar from being in any respect a crank, he was a most able and\nwell-balanced mentality--a genius. The day came when, Dorothy not having\nreturned from a shopping tour, he lingered in the laboratory talking\nwith the father, or, rather, listening while the man of great ideas\nunfolded to him conceptions of the world that set his imagination to\nsoaring.\n\nMost of us see but dimly beyond the ends of our noses, and visualize\nwhat lies within our range of sight most imperfectly. We know little\nabout ourselves, less about others. We fancy that the world and the\nhuman race always have been about as they now are, and always will be.\nHistory reads to us like a fairy tale, to which we give conventional\nacceptance as truth. As to the future, we can conceive nothing but the\ncontinuation of just what we see about us in the present. Norman,\npractical man though he was, living in and for the present, had yet an\nimagination. He thought Hallowell a kind of fool for thinking only of\nthe future and working only for it--but he soon came to think him a\ndivine fool. And through Hallowell's spectacles he was charmed for many\nan hour with visions of the world that is to be when, in the slow but\nsteady processes of evolution, the human race will become intelligent,\nwill conquer the universe with the weapons of science and will make it\nover.\n\nWhen he first stated his projects to Norman, the young man had\ndifficulty in restraining his amusement. A new idea, in any line of\nthought with which we are not familiar, always strikes us as ridiculous.\nNorman had been educated in the ignorant conventional way still in high\nrepute among the vulgar and among those whose chief delight is to make\nthe vulgar gape in awe. He therefore had no science, that is, no\nknowledge--outside his profession--but only what is called learning,\nthough tommyrot would be a fitter name for it. He had only the most\nmeager acquaintance with that great fundamental of a sound and sane\neducation, embryology. He knew nothing of what science had already done\nto destroy all the still current notions about the mystery of life and\nbirth. He still laughed, as at a clever bit of legerdemain, when\nHallowell showed him how far science had progressed toward mastery of\nthe life of the lower forms of existence--how those \"worms\" could be\nartificially created, could be aged, made young again, made diseased and\ndecrepit, restored to perfect health, could be swung back and forth or\nsideways or sinuously along the span of existence--could even be killed\nand brought back to vigor.\n\n\"We've been at this sort of thing only a few years,\" said Hallowell. \"I\nrather think it will not be many years now before we shall not even need\nthe initial germ of life to enable us to create but can do it by pure\nchemical means, just as a taper is lighted by holding a match to it.\"\n\nNorman ceased to think of sleight-of-hand.\n\n\"Life,\" continued the juggler, transformed now into practical man,\nleader of men, \"life has been demonstrated to be simply one of the forms\nof energy, or one of the consequences of energy. The final discovery is\nscientifically not far away. Then--\" His eyes lighted up.\n\n\"Then what?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"Then immortality--in the body. Eternal youth and health. A body that is\nrenewable much as any of our inanimate machines of the factory is\nrenewable. Why not? So far as we know, no living thing ever dies except\nby violence. Disease--old age--they are quite as much violence as the\nknife and the bullet. What science can now do with these 'worms,' as my\ndaughter calls them--that it will be able to do with the higher\norganisms.\"\n\n\"And the world would soon be jammed to the last acre,\" objected Norman.\n\nHallowell shrugged his shoulders. \"Not at all. There will be no\nnecessity to create new people, except to take the place of those who\nmay be accidentally obliterated.\"\n\n\"But the world is dying--the earth, itself, I mean.\"\n\n\"True. But science may learn how to arrest that cooling process--or to\nadapt man to it. Or, it may be that when the world ceases to be\ninhabitable we shall have learned how to cross the star spaces, as I\nthink I've suggested before. Then--we should simply find a planet in its\nyouth somewhere, and migrate to it, as a man now moves to a new house\nwhen the old ceases to please him.\"\n\n\"That is a long flight of the fancy,\" said Norman.\n\n\"Long--but no stronger than the telegraph or the telephone. The trouble\nwith us is that we have been long stupefied by the ignorant theological\nideas of the universe--ideas that have come down to us from the\nchildhood of the race. We haven't got used to the new era--the\nscientific era. And that is natural. Why, until less than three\ngenerations ago there was really no such thing as science.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" admitted Norman. \"We certainly have got on\nvery fast in those three generations.\"\n\n\"Rather fast. Not so fast, however, as we shall in the next three.\nScience--chemistry--is going speedily to change all the conditions of\nlife because it will turn topsy-turvy all the ways of producing\nthings--food, clothing, shelter. Less than two generations ago men lived\nmuch as they had for thousands of years. But it's very different to-day.\nIt will be inconceivably different to-morrow.\"\n\nNorman could not get these ideas out of his brain. He began to\nunderstand why Hallowell cared nothing about the active life of the\nday--about its religion, politics, modes of labor, its habits of one\ncreature preying upon another. To-morrow, not religion, not politics,\nbut chemistry, not priests nor politicians, but chemists, would change\nall that--and change it by the only methods that compel. An abstract\nidea of liberty or justice can be rejected, evaded, nullified. But a\ntelephone, a steam engine, a mode of prolonging life--those realizations\nof ideas _compel_.\n\nWhen Dorothy came, Norman went into the garden with her in a frame of\nmind so different from any he had ever before experienced that he\nscarcely recognized himself. As the influence of the father's glowing\nimagination of genius waned before the daughter's physical loveliness\nand enchantment for him, he said to himself, \"I'll keep away from him.\"\nWhy? He did not permit himself to go on to examine into his reasons. But\nhe could not conceal them from himself quickly enough to hide the\nknowledge that they were moral.\n\n\"What is the matter with you to-day?\" said Dorothy. \"You are not a bit\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Interested, you mean,\" he said with a smile of raillery, for he had\nlong since discovered that she was not without the feminine vanity that\ncommands the centering of all interest in the woman herself and resents\nany wandering of thought as a slur upon her own powers of fascination.\n\n\"Well, interested then,\" said she. \"You are thinking about something\nelse.\"\n\n\"Not now,\" he assured her.\n\nBut he left early. No sooner had he got away from the house than the\nscientific dreaming vanished and he wished himself back with her\nagain--back where every glance at her gave him the most exquisite\nsensations. And when he came the following day he apparently had once\nmore restored her father to his proper place of a nonessential. All that\ndefinitely remained of the day before's impression was a certain\nsatisfaction that he was aiding with his money an enterprise of greater\nvalue and of less questionable character than merely his own project.\nBut the powerful influences upon our life and conduct are rarely direct\nand definite. He, quite unconsciously, had a wholly different feeling\nabout Dorothy because of her father, because of what his new knowledge\nof and respect for her father had revealed and would continue to reveal\nto him as to the girl herself--her training, her inheritance, her\ncharacter that could not but be touched with the splendor of the\nfather's noble genius. And long afterward, when the father as a distinct\npersonality had been almost forgotten, Norman was still, altogether\nunconsciously, influenced by him--powerfully, perhaps decisively\ninfluenced. Norman had no notion of it, but ever after that talk in the\nlaboratory, Dorothy Hallowell was to him Newton Hallowell's daughter.\n\nWhen he came the following day, with his original purposes and plans\nonce more intact, as he thought, he found that she had made more of a\ntoilet than usual, had devised a new way of doing her hair that enabled\nhim to hang a highly prized addition in his memory gallery of widely\nvaried portraits of her.\n\nThe afternoon was warm. They sat under a big old tree at the end of the\ngarden. He saw that she was much disturbed--and that it had to do with\nhim. From time to time she looked at him, studying his face when she\nthought herself unobserved. As he had learned that it is never wise to\nopen up the disagreeable, he waited. After making several futile efforts\nat conversation, she abruptly said:\n\n\"I saw Mr. Tetlow this morning--in Twenty-third Street. I was coming out\nof a chemical supplies store where father had sent me.\"\n\nShe paused. But Norman did not help her. He continued to wait.\n\n\"He--Mr. Tetlow--acted very strangely,\" she went on. \"I spoke to him. He\nstared at me as if he weren't going to speak--as if I weren't fit to\nspeak to.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Norman.\n\n\"Then he came hurrying after me. And he said, 'Do you know that Norman\nis to be married in two weeks?'\"\n\n\"So!\" said Norman.\n\n\"And I said, 'What of it? How does that interest me?'\"\n\n\"It didn't interest you?\"\n\n\"I was surprised that you hadn't spoken of it,\" replied she. \"But I was\nmore interested in Mr. Tetlow's manner. What do you think he said next?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" said Norman.\n\n\"Why--that I was even more shameless than he thought. He said: 'Oh, I\nknow all about you. I found out by accident. I shan't tell anyone, for I\ncan't help loving you still. But it has killed my belief in woman to\nfind out that _you_ would sell yourself.'\"\n\nShe was looking at Norman with eyes large and grave. \"And what did you\nsay?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I didn't say anything. I looked at him as if he weren't there and\nstarted on. Then he said, 'When Norman abandons you, as he soon will,\nyou can count on me, if you need a friend.'\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then Norman said, \"And that was all?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied she.\n\nAnother pause. Norman said musingly: \"Poor Tetlow! I've not seen him\nsince he went away to Bermuda--at least he said he was going there. One\nday he sent the firm a formal letter of resignation. . . . Poor Tetlow!\nDo you regret not having married him?\"\n\n\"I couldn't marry a man I didn't love.\" She looked at him with sweet\nfriendly eyes. \"I couldn't even marry you, much as I like you.\"\n\nNorman laughed--a dismal attempt at ease and raillery.\n\n\"When he told me about your marrying,\" she went on, \"I knew how I felt\nabout you. For I was not a bit jealous. Why haven't you ever said\nanything about it?\"\n\nHe disregarded this. He leaned forward and with curious deliberateness\ntook her hand. She let it lie gently in his. He put his arm round her\nand drew her close to him. She did not resist. He kissed her upturned\nface, kissed her upon the lips. She remained passive, looking at him\nwith calm eyes.\n\n\"Kiss me,\" he said.\n\nShe kissed him--without hesitation and without warmth.\n\n\"Why do you look at me so?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I can't understand.\"\n\n\"Understand what?\"\n\n\"Why you should wish to kiss me when you love another woman. What would\nshe say if she knew?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know. And I rather think I don't care. You are the\nonly person on earth that interests me.\"\n\n\"Then why are you marrying?\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about ourselves.\" He clasped her\npassionately, kissed her at first with self-restraint, then in a kind of\nfrenzy. \"How can you be so cruel!\" he cried. \"Are you utterly cold?\"\n\n\"I do not love you,\" she said.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"There's no reason. I--just don't. I've sometimes thought perhaps it was\nbecause you don't love me.\"\n\n\"Good God, Dorothy! What do you want me to say or do?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied she calmly. \"You asked me why I didn't love you, and\nI was trying to explain. I don't want anything more than I'm getting. I\nam content--aren't you?\"\n\n\"Content!\" He laughed sardonically. \"As well ask Tantalus if he is\ncontent, with the water always before his eyes and always out of reach.\nI want you--all you have to give. I couldn't be content with less.\"\n\n\"You ought not to talk to me this way,\" she reproved gently, \"when you\nare engaged.\"\n\nHe flung her hand into her lap. \"You are making a fool of me. And I\ndon't wonder. I've invited it. Surely, never since man was created has\nthere been such another ass as I.\" He drew her to her feet, seized her\nroughly by the shoulders. \"When are you coming to your senses?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she inquired, in her childlike puzzled way.\n\nHe shook her, kissed her violently, held her at arm's length. \"Do you\nthink it wise to trifle with me?\" he asked. \"Don't your good sense tell\nyou there's a limit even to such folly as mine?\"\n\n\"What _is_ the matter?\" she asked pathetically. \"What do you want? I can't\ngive you what I haven't got to give.\"\n\n\"No,\" he cried. \"But I want what you _have_ got to give.\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly. \"Really, I haven't, Mr. Norman.\"\n\nHe eyed her with cynical amused suspicion. \"Why did you call me _Mr._\nNorman just then? Usually you don't call me at all. It's been weeks\nsince you have called me Mister. Was your doing it just then one of\nthose subtle, adroit, timely tricks of yours?\"\n\nShe was the picture of puzzled innocence. \"I don't understand,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Well--perhaps you don't,\" said he doubtfully. \"At any rate, don't call\nme Mr. Norman. Call me Fred.\"\n\n\"I can't. It isn't natural. You seem Mister to me. I always think of you\nas Mr. Norman.\"\n\n\"That's it. And it must stop!\"\n\nShe smiled with innocent gayety. \"Very well--Fred. . . . Fred. . . . Now\nthat I've said it, I don't find it strange.\" She looked at him with an\nexpression between appeal and mockery. \"If you'd only let me get\nacquainted with you. But you don't. You make me feel that I've got to be\ncareful with you--that I must be on my guard. I don't know against\nwhat--for you are certainly the very best friend that I've ever had--the\nonly real friend.\"\n\nHe frowned and bit his lip--and felt uncomfortable, though he protested\nto himself that he was simply irritated at her slyness. Yes, it must be\nslyness.\n\n\"So,\" she went on, \"there's no _reason_ for being on guard. Still, I feel\nthat way.\" She looked at him with sweet gravity. \"Perhaps I shouldn't if\nyou didn't talk about love to me and kiss me in a way I feel you've no\nright to.\"\n\nAgain he laid his hands upon her shoulders. This time he gazed angrily\ninto her eyes. \"Are you a fool? Or are you making a fool of me?\" he\nsaid. \"I can't decide which.\"\n\n\"I certainly am very foolish,\" was her apologetic answer. \"I don't know\na lot of things, like you and father. I'm only a girl.\"\n\nAnd he had the maddening sense of being baffled again--of having got\nnowhere, of having demonstrated afresh to himself and to her his own\nweakness where she was concerned. What unbelievable weakness! Had there\never been such another case? Yes, there must have been. How little he\nhad known of the possibilities of the relations of men and women--he\nwho had prided himself on knowing all!\n\nShe said, \"You are going to marry?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" replied he sourly.\n\n\"Are you worried about the expense? Is it costing you too much, this\nhelping father? Are you sorry you went into it?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"You are sorry?\" she exclaimed. \"You feel that you are wasting your\nmoney?\"\n\nHis generosity forbade him to keep up the pretense that might aid him in\nhis project. \"No,\" he said hastily. \"No, indeed. This expense--it's\nnothing.\" He flushed, hung his head in shame before his own weakness, as\nhe added, in complete surrender, \"I'm very glad to be helping your\nfather.\"\n\n\"I knew you would be!\" she cried triumphantly. \"I knew it!\" And she\nflung her arms round his neck and kissed him.\n\n\"That's better!\" he said with a foolishly delighted laugh. \"I believe we\nare beginning to get acquainted.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I feel quite different already.\"\n\n\"I hoped so. You are coming to your senses?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Only--\" She laid a beautiful white pleading hand upon his\nshoulder and gazed earnestly into his eyes--\"please don't frighten me\nwith that talk--and those other kisses.\"\n\nHe looked at her uncertainly. \"Come round in your own way,\" he said at\nlast. \"I don't want to hurry you. I suppose every bird has its own way\nof dropping from a perch.\"\n\n\"You don't like my way?\" she inquired.\n\nIt was said archly but also in the way that always made him vaguely\nuneasy, made him feel like one facing a mystery which should be explored\ncautiously. \"It is graceful,\" he admitted, with a smile since he could\nnot venture to frown. \"Graceful--but slow.\"\n\nShe laughed--and he could not but feel that the greater laughter in her\ntoo innocent eyes was directed at him. She talked of other things--and\nhe let her--charmed, yet cursing his folly, his slavery, the while.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nMany a time he had pitied a woman for letting him get away from her,\nwhen she obviously wished to hold him and failed solely because she did\nnot understand her business. Like every other man, he no sooner began to\nbe attracted by a woman than he began to invest her with a mystery and\nawe which she either could dissipate by forcing him to see the truth of\nher commonplaceness or could increase into a power that would enslave\nhim by keeping him agitated and interested and ever satisfied yet ever\nbaffled. But no woman had shown this supreme skill in the art of\nlove--until Dorothy Hallowell. She exasperated him. She fascinated him.\nShe kept him so restless that his professional work was all but\nneglected. Was it her skill? Was it her folly? Was she simply leading\nhim on and on, guided blindly by woman's instinct to get as much as she\ncould and to give as little as she dared? Or was she protected by a real\nindifference to him--the strongest, indeed the only invulnerable armor a\nwoman can wear? Was she protecting herself? Or was it merely that he,\nweakened by his infatuation, was doing the protecting for her?\n\nBeside these distracting questions, the once all-important matter of\nprofessional and worldly ambition seemed not worth troubling about. They\neven so vexed him that he had become profoundly indifferent as to\nJosephine. He saw her rarely. When they were alone he either talked\nneutral subjects or sat almost mute, hardly conscious of her presence.\nHe received her efforts at the customary caressings with such stolidity\nthat she soon ceased to annoy him. They reduced their outward show of\naffection to a kiss when they met, another when they separated. He was\ntired--always tired--worn out--half sick--harassed by business\nconcerns. He did not trouble himself about whether his listless excuses\nwould be accepted or not. He did not care what she thought--or might\nthink--or might do.\n\nJosephine was typical of the women of the comfortable class. For them\nthe fundamentally vital matters of life--the profoundly harassing\nquestions of food, clothing, and shelter--are arranged and settled. What\nis there left to occupy their minds? Little but the idle emotions they\nmanufacture and spread foglike over their true natures to hide the\nbarrenness, the monotony. They fool with phrases about art or love or\nreligion or charity--for none of those things can be vivid realities to\nthose who are swathed and stupefied in a luxury they have not to take\nthe least thought to provide for themselves. Like all those women,\nJosephine fancied herself complex--fancied she was a person of variety\nand of depth because she repeated with a slight change of wording the\nthings she read in clever books or heard from clever men. There seemed\nto Norman to be small enough originality, personality, to the ordinary\nman of the comfortable class; but there was some, because his necessity\nof struggling with and against his fellow men in the several arenas of\nactive life compelled him to be at least a little of a person. In the\nwomen there seemed nothing at all--not even in Josephine. When he\nlistened to her, when he thought of her, now--he was calmly critical. He\njudged her as a human specimen--judged much as would have old Newton\nHallowell to whom the whole world was mere laboratory.\n\nShe bored him now--and he made no effort beyond bare politeness to\nconceal the fact from her. The situation was saved from becoming\nintolerable by that universal saver of intolerable situations, vanity.\nShe had the ordinary human vanity. In addition, she had the peculiar\nvanity of woman, the creation of man's flatteries lavished upon the sex\nhe alternately serves and spurns. In further addition, she had the\nvanity of her class--the comfortable class that feels superior to the\nmass of mankind in fortune, in intellect, in taste, in everything\ndesirable. Heaped upon all these vanities was her vanity of high social\nrank--and atop the whole her vanity of great wealth. None but the\nsweetest and simplest of human beings can stand up and remain human\nunder such a weight as this. If we are at all fair in our judgments of\nour fellow men, we marvel that the triumphant class--especially the\nwomen, whose point of view is never corrected by the experiences of\npractical life--are not more arrogant, more absurdly forgetful of the\noneness and the feebleness of humanity.\n\nJosephine was by nature one of the sweet and simple souls. And her love\nfor Norman, after the habit of genuine love, had destroyed all the\ninstinct of coquetry. The woman--or, the man--has to be indeed\ninteresting, indeed an individuality, to remain interesting when\nsincerely in love, and so elevated above the petty but potent sex\ntrickeries. Josephine, deeply in love, was showing herself to Norman in\nher undisguised natural sweet simplicity--and monotony. But, while men\nadmire and reverence a sweet and simple feminine soul--and love her in\nplays and between the covers of a book and when she is talking\nhighfaluting abstractions of morality--and wax wroth with any other man\nwho ignores or neglects her--they do not in their own persons become\ninfatuated with her. Passion is too much given to moods for that; it has\na morbid craving for variety, for the mysterious and the baffling.\n\nThe only thing that saves the race from ruin through passion is the\nrarity of those by nature or by art expert in using it. Norman felt that\nhe was paying the penalty for his persistent search for this rarity; one\nof the basest tricks of destiny upon man is to give him what he\nwants--wealth, or fame, or power, or the woman who enslaves. Norman\nfelt that destiny had suddenly revealed its resolve to destroy him by\ngiving him not one of the things he wanted, but all.\n\nThe marriage was not quite two weeks away. About the time that the\nordinary plausible excuses for Norman's neglect, his abstraction, his\nseeming indifference were exhausted, Josephine's vanity came forward to\nexplain everything to her, all to her own glory. As the elysian hour\napproached--so vanity assured her--the man who loved her as her complex\nsoul and many physical and social advantages deserved was overcome with\nthat shy terror of which she had read in the poets and the novelists. A\nlarge income, fashionable attire and surroundings, a carriage and a\nmaid--these things gave a woman a subtle and superior intellect and\nsoul. How? Why? No one knew. But everyone admitted, indeed saw, the\ntruth. Further, these beings--these great ladies--according to all the\naccredited poets, novelists, and other final authorities upon\nlife--always inspired the most awed and worshipful and diffident\nfeelings in their lovers. Therefore, she--the great lady--was getting\nbut her due. She would have liked something else--something common and\nhuman--much better. But, having always led her life as the conventions\ndictated, never as the common human heart yearned, she had no keen sense\nof dissatisfaction to rouse her to revolt and to question. Also, she was\nbreathlessly busy with trousseau and the other arrangements for the\ngrand wedding.\n\nOne afternoon she telephoned Norman asking him to come on his way home\nthat evening. \"I particularly wish to see you,\" she said. He thought her\nvoice sounded rather queer, but he did not take sufficient interest to\nspeculate about it. When he was with her in the small drawing room on\nthe second floor, he noted that her eyes were regarding him strangely.\nHe thought he understood why when she said:\n\n\"Aren't you going to kiss me, Fred?\"\n\nHe put on his good-natured, slightly mocking smile. \"I thought you were\ntoo busy for that sort of thing nowadays.\" And he bent and kissed her\nwaiting lips. Then he lit a cigarette and seated himself on the sofa\nbeside her--the sofa at right angles to the open fire. \"Well?\" he said.\n\nShe gazed into the fire for full a minute before she said in a voice of\nconstraint, \"What became of that--that girl--the Miss Hallowell----\"\n\nShe broke off abruptly. There was a pause choked with those dizzy\npulsations that fill moments of silence and strain. Then with a sob she\nflung herself against his breast and buried her face in his shoulder.\n\"Don't answer!\" she cried. \"I'm ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed--ashamed!\"\n\nHe put his arm about her shoulders. \"But why shouldn't I answer?\" said\nhe in the kindly gentle tone we can all assume when a matter that\nagitates some one else is wholly indifferent to us.\n\n\"Because--it was a--a trap,\" she answered hysterically. \"Fred--there was\na man here this afternoon--a man named Tetlow. He got in only because\nhe said he came from you.\"\n\nNorman laughed quietly. \"Poor Tetlow!\" he said. \"He used to be your head\nclerk--didn't he?\"\n\n\"And one of my few friends.\"\n\n\"He's not your friend, Fred!\" she cried, sitting upright and speaking\nwith energy that quivered in her voice and flashed in her fine brown\neyes. \"He's your enemy--a snake in the grass--a malicious,\npoisonous----\"\n\nNorman's quiet, even laugh interrupted. \"Oh, no,\" said he. \"Tetlow's a\ngood fellow. Anything he said would be what he honestly\nbelieved--anything he said about me.\"\n\n\"He pleaded that he was doing it for your good,\" she went on with scorn.\n\"They always do--like the people that write father wicked anonymous\nletters. He--this man Tetlow--he said he wanted me for the sake of my\nlove for you to save you from yourself.\"\n\nNorman glanced at her with amused eyes. \"Well, why don't you? But then\nyou _are_ doing it. You're marrying me, aren't you?\"\n\nAgain she put her head upon his shoulder. \"Indeed I am!\" she cried. \"And\nI'd be a poor sort if I let a sneak shake my confidence in you.\"\n\nHe patted her shoulder, and there was laughter in his voice as he said,\n\"But I never professed to be trustworthy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know you _used_ to--\" She laughed and kissed his cheek. \"Never\nmind. I've heard. But while you were engaged to me--about to marry\nme--why, you simply couldn't!\"\n\n\"Couldn't what?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Do you want me to tell you what he said?\"\n\n\"I think I know. But do as you like.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd better tell you. I seem to want to get rid of it.\"\n\n\"Then do.\"\n\n\"It was about that girl.\" She sat upright and looked at him for\nencouragement. He nodded. She went on: \"He said that if I asked you, you\nwould not dare deny you were--were--giving her money.\"\n\n\"Her and her father.\"\n\nShe shrank, startled. Then her lips smiled bravely, and she said, \"He\ndidn't say anything about her father.\"\n\n\"No. That was my own correction of his story.\"\n\nShe looked at him with wonder and doubt. \"You aren't--_doing_ it, Fred!\"\nshe exclaimed.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes, indeed.\" He looked at her placidly. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"You are _supporting_ her?\"\n\n\"If you wish to put it that way,\" said he carelessly. \"My money pays the\nbills--all the bills.\"\n\n\"Fred!\"\n\n\"Yes? What is it? Why are you so agitated?\" He studied her face, then\nrose, took a final pull at the cigarette, tossed it in the fire. \"I must\nbe going,\" he said, in a cool, even voice.\n\nShe started up in a panic. \"Fred! What do you mean? Are you angry with\nme?\"\n\nHis calm regard met hers. \"I do not like--this sort of thing,\" he said.\n\n\"But surely you'll explain. Surely I'm entitled to an explanation.\"\n\n\"Why should I explain? You have evidently found an explanation that\nsatisfies you.\" He drew himself up in a quiet gesture of haughtiness.\n\"Besides, it has never been my habit to allow myself to be questioned or\nto explain myself.\"\n\nHer eyes widened with terror. \"Fred!\" she gasped. \"What _do_ you mean?\"\n\n\"Precisely what I say,\" said he, in the same cool, inevitable way. \"A\nman came to you with a story about me. You listened. A sufficient answer\nto the story was that I am marrying you. That answer apparently does not\ncontent you. Very well. I shall make no other.\"\n\nShe gazed at him uncertainly. She felt him going--and going finally.\nShe seized him with desperate fingers, cried: \"I _am_ content. Oh,\nFred--don't frighten me this way!\"\n\nHe smiled satirically. \"Are you afraid of the scandal--because\neverything for the wedding has gone so far?\"\n\n\"How can you think that!\" cried she--perhaps too vigorously, a woman\nwould have thought.\n\n\"What else is there for me to think? You certainly haven't shown any\nconsideration for me.\"\n\n\"But you told me yourself that you were false to me.\"\n\n\"Really? When?\"\n\nShe forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of\nwhat she was doing--of how leniently and weakly and without pride she\nwas dealing with this man. \"Didn't you admit----\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said he, and his manner might well have calmed the wildest\ntempest of anger. \"I did not admit. I never admit. I leave that to\npeople of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize. I simply told\nyou I was paying the expenses of a family named Hallowell.\"\n\n\"But _why_ should you do it, Fred?\"\n\nHis smile was gently satirical. \"I thought Tetlow told you why.\"\n\n\"I don't believe him!\"\n\n\"Then why this excitement?\"\n\nOne could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him. \"I\ndon't know just why,\" she stammered. \"It seemed to me you were\nadmitting--I mean, you were confirming what that man accused you of.\"\n\n\"And of what did he accuse me? I might say, of what do _you_ accuse me?\"\nWhen she remained silent he went on: \"I am trying to be reasonable,\nJosephine. I am trying to keep my temper.\"\n\nThe look in her eyes--the fear, the timidity--was a startling revelation\nof character--of the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest\nnature. \"I know I've been foolish and incoherent, Fred,\" she pleaded.\n\"But--I love you! And you remember how I always was afraid of that\ngirl.\"\n\n\"Just what do you wish to know?\"\n\n\"Nothing, dear--nothing. I am not sillily jealous. I ought to be\nadmiring you for your generosity--your charity.\"\n\n\"It's neither the one nor the other,\" said he with exasperating\ndeliberateness.\n\nShe quivered. \"Then _what_ is it?\" she cried. \"You are driving me crazy\nwith your evasions.\" Pleadingly, \"You must admit they _are_ evasions.\"\n\nHe buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart. She instantly\ntook alarm. \"I don't mean that. It's my fault, not asking you straight\nout. Fred, tell me--won't you? But if you are too cross with me,\nthen--don't tell me.\" She laughed nervously, hiding her submission\nbeneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility. \"I'll be good.\nI'll behave.\"\n\nA man who admired her as a figure, a man who liked her, a man who had no\nfeeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty\nnearly everybody--in brief, any man but one who had loved her and had\ngotten over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her. Fred\nNorman said, his look and his tone coolly calm:\n\n\"I am backing Mr. Hallowell in a company for which he is doing chemical\nresearch work. We are hatching eggs, out of the shell, so to speak. Also\nwe are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like. So far we have\ndeclared no dividends. But we have hopes.\"\n\nShe gave a hysterical sob of relief. \"Then it's only business--not the\ngirl at all!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's the girl, too,\" replied he. \"She's an officer of the\ncompany. In fact, it was to make a place for her that I went into the\nenterprise originally.\" With an engaging air of frankness he inquired,\n\"Anything more?\"\n\nShe was gazing soberly, almost somberly, into the fire. \"You'll not be\noffended if I ask you one question?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Is there anything between you and--her?\"\n\n\"You mean, am I having an affair with her?\"\n\nShe hung her head, but managed to make a slight nod of assent.\n\nHe laughed. \"No.\" He laughed again. \"No--not thus far, my dear.\" He\nlaughed a third time, with still stronger and stranger mockery. \"She\ncongratulated me on my engagement with a sincerity that would have\npiqued a man who was interested in her.\"\n\n\"Will you forgive me?\" Josephine said. \"What I've just been feeling and\nsaying and putting you through--it's beneath both of us. I suppose a\nwoman--no woman--can help being nasty where another woman is\nconcerned.\"\n\nWith his satirical good-humored smile, \"I don't in the least blame you.\"\n\n\"And you'll not think less of me for giving way to a thing so vulgar?\"\n\nHe kissed her with a carelessness that made her wince But she felt that\nshe deserved it--and was grateful. He said: \"Why don't you go over and\nsee for yourself? No doubt Tetlow gave you the address--and no doubt\nyou have remembered it.\"\n\nShe colored and hastily turned her head. \"Don't punish me,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Punish you? What nonsense! . . . Do you want me to take you over? The\nlaboratory would interest you--and Miss Hallowell is lovelier than ever.\nShe has an easier life now. Office work wears on women terribly.\"\n\nJosephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of love and trust. \"You\nwish to be sure I'm cured. Well, can't you see that I am?\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should be. I've said nothing one way or the other.\"\n\nShe laughed gayly. \"You can't tempt me. I'm really cured. I think the\nonly reason I had the attack was because Mr. Tetlow so evidently\nbelieved he was speaking the truth.\"\n\n\"No doubt he did think he was. I'm sure, in the same circumstances, I'd\nthink of anyone else just what he thinks of me.\"\n\n\"Then why do you do it, Fred?\" urged she with ill-concealed eagerness.\n\"It isn't fair to the girl, is it?\"\n\n\"No one but you and Tetlow knows I'm doing it.\"\n\n\"You're mistaken there, dear. Tetlow says a great many people down town\nare talking about it--that they say you go almost every day to Jersey\nCity to see her. He accuses you of having ruined her reputation. He says\nshe is quite innocent. He blames the whole thing upon you.\"\n\nNorman, standing with arms folded upon his broad chest, was gazing\nthoughtfully into the fire.\n\n\"You don't mind my telling you these things?\" she said anxiously. \"Of\ncourse, I know they are lies----\"\n\n\"So everyone is talking about it,\" interrupted he, so absorbed that he\nhad not heard her.\n\n\"You don't realize how conspicuous you are.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"You can't afford to be mixed up in a scandal,\" she ventured, \"or to\ninjure a poor little creature--I'm afraid you'll have to--to stop it.\"\n\n\"Stop it.\" His eyes gleamed with mirth and something else. \"It isn't my\nhabit to heed gossip.\"\n\n\"But think of _her_, Fred!\"\n\nHe smiled ironically. \"What a generous, thoughtful dear you are!\" said\nhe.\n\nShe blushed. \"I'll admit I don't like it. I'm not jealous--but I wish\nyou weren't doing it.\"\n\n\"So do I!\" he exclaimed, with sudden energy that astonished and\ndisquieted her. \"So do I! But since it can't be helped I shall go on.\"\n\nNever had she respected him so profoundly. For the first time she had\nmeasured strength with him and had been beaten and routed. She fancied\nherself enormously proud; for she labored under the common delusion\nwhich mistakes for pride the silly vanity of class, or birth, or wealth,\nor position. She had imagined she would never lower that cherished pride\nof hers to any man. And she had lowered it into the dust. No wonder\nwomen had loved him, she said to herself; couldn't he do with them, even\nthe haughtiest of them, precisely as he pleased? He had not tried to\ncalm, much less to end her jealousy; on the contrary, he had let it\nflame as high as it would, had urged it higher. And she did not dare ask\nhim, even as a loving concession to her weakness, to give up an affair\nupon which everybody was putting the natural worst possible\nconstruction! On the contrary, she had given him leave to go on--because\nshe feared--yes, knew--that if she tried to interfere he would take it\nas evidence that they could not get on together. What a man!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was more to come that day. As he was finishing dressing for\ndinner his sister Ursula knocked. \"May I come, Frederick?\" she said.\n\n\"Sure,\" he cried. \"I'm fixing my tie.\"\n\nUrsula, in a gown that displayed the last possible--many of the\nhomelier women said impossible--inch of her beautiful shoulders, came\nstrolling sinuously in and seated herself on the arm of the divan. She\nwatched him, in his evening shirt, as he with much struggling did his\ntie. \"How young you do look, Fred!\" said she. \"Especially in just that\nmuch clothes. Not a day over thirty.\"\n\n\"I'm not exactly a nonogenarian,\" retorted he.\n\n\"But usually your face--in spite of its smoothness and no wrinkles--has\na kind of an old young--or do I mean young old?--look. You've led such a\nserious life.\"\n\n\"Um. That's the devil of it.\"\n\n\"You're looking particularly young to-night.\"\n\n\"Same to you, Urse.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not bad for thirty-four. People half believe me when I say I'm\ntwenty-nine.\" She glanced complacently down at her softly glistening\nshoulders. \"I've still got my skin.\"\n\n\"And a mighty good one it is. Best I ever saw--except one.\"\n\nShe reflected a moment, then smiled. \"I know it isn't Josephine's. Hers\nis good but not notable. Eyes and teeth are her strongholds. I suppose\nit's--the other lady's.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"I mean the one in Jersey City.\"\n\nHe went on brushing his hair with not a glance at the bomb she had\nexploded under his very nose.\n\n\"You're a cool one,\" she said admiringly.\n\n\"Cool?\"\n\n\"I thought you'd jump. I'm sure you never dreamed I knew.\"\n\nHe slid into his white waistcoat and began to button it.\n\n\"Though you might know I'd find out,\" she went on, \"when everyone's\ntalking.\"\n\n\"Everyone's always talking,\" said he indifferently.\n\n\"And they rattle on to beat the band when they get a chance at a man\nlike you. Do you know what they're saying?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Loosen these straps in the back of my waistcoat--the upper\nones, won't you?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"She glanced complacently down at her softly glistening\nshoulders.\"]\n\nAs she fussed with the buckles she said: \"But you don't know that they\nsay you're going to pieces--neglecting your cases--keeping away from\nyour office--wasting about half of your day with your lady love. They\nsay that you have gone stark mad--that you are rushing to ruin.\"\n\n\"A little looser. That's better. Thanks.\"\n\n\"And everyone's wondering when Josephine will hear and go on the\nrampage. She's so proud and so stuck on herself that they're betting\nshe'll give you the bounce.\"\n\n\"Well--\" getting into his coat--\"you'd delight in that. For you don't\nlike her.\"\n\n\"Oh--so--so,\" replied Ursula. \"She's all right, as women go. You know we\nwomen don't ever think any too well of each other. We're 'on.' Now, I'm\nfrank to admit I'm not worth the powder to blow me up. I can't do\nanything worth doing. I don't know anything worth knowing--except how to\ndress and make a fool of an occasional man. I'm not a good house-keeper,\nnor a good wife--and I'd as lief go to jail for two years as have a\nbaby. But I admit I'm n. g. Most women are as poor excuses as I am, yet\nthey think they're _grand_!\"\n\nNorman, standing before his sister and smiling mysteriously, said: \"My\ndear Urse, let me give you a great truth in a sentence. The value of\nanything is not its value to itself or in itself, but its value to some\none else. A woman--even as incompetent a person as you----\"\n\n\"Or Josephine.\"\n\n\"--or Josephine--may seem to some man to be pricelessly valuable. And if\nshe happens to seem so to him, why, she _is_ so.\"\n\n\"Meaning--Jersey City?\"\n\nHis eyes glittered curiously. \"Meaning Jersey City,\" he said.\n\nA long silence. Then Ursula: \"But suppose Josephine hears?\"\n\nHe stood beside the doorway, waiting for her to pass out. His face\nexpressed nothing. \"Let's go down. I'm hungry. We were talking about it\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"You and Jo!\"\n\n\"Josephine and I.\"\n\n\"And it's all right?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You fooled her?\"\n\n\"I don't stoop to that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" she laughed. \"You rise to heights of deception that would\nmake anyone else giddy. Oh, I'd give anything to have heard.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to deceive about,\" said he.\n\nShe shook her head. \"You can't put it over me, Fred. You've never before\nmade a fool of yourself about a woman. I'd like to see her. I suppose\nI'd be amazed. I've observed that the women who do the most\nextraordinary things with men are the most ordinary sort of women.\"\n\n\"Not to the men,\" said he bitterly. \"Not while they're doing it.\"\n\n\"Does _she_ seem extraordinary to _you_ still?\"\n\nHe thrust his hands deep in his pockets. \"What you heard is true. I'm\nletting everything slide--work--career--everything. I think of nothing\nelse. Ursula, I'm mad about her--mad!\"\n\nShe threw back her head, looked at him admiringly. Never had she so\nutterly worshiped this wonderful, powerful brother of hers. He was in\nlove--really--madly in love--at last. So he was perfect! \"How long do\nyou think it will hold, Fred?\" she said, all sympathy.\n\n\"God knows!\"\n\n\"Yet--caring for her you can go on and marry another woman!\"\n\nHe looked at his sister cynically. \"You wouldn't have me marry _her_,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" protested she hastily. Her passion for romance did not\ncarry her to that idiocy. \"You couldn't. She's a sort of working\ngirl--isn't she?--anyhow, that class. No, you couldn't marry her. But\nhow can you marry another woman?\"\n\n\"How could I give up Josephine?--and give her up probably to Bob\nCulver?\"\n\nUrsula nodded understandingly. \"But--what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"How should I know? Perhaps break it off when I marry--if you can call\nit breaking off, when there's nothing to break but--me.\"\n\n\"You don't mean--\" she cried, stopping when her tone had carried her\nmeaning.\n\nHe laughed. \"Yes--that's the kind of damn fool I've been.\"\n\n\"You must have let her see how crazy you were about her.\"\n\n\"Was anyone ever able to hide that sort of insanity?\"\n\nUrsula gazed wonderingly at him, drew a long breath. \"You!\" she\nexclaimed. \"Of all men--you!\"\n\n\"Let's go down.\"\n\n\"She must be a deep one--dangerous,\" said Ursula, furious against the\nwoman who was daring to resist her matchless brother. \"Fred, I'm wild to\nsee her. Maybe I'd see something that'd help cure you.\"\n\n\"You keep out of it,\" he replied, curtly but not with ill humor.\n\n\"It can't last long.\"\n\n\"It'd do for me, if it did.\"\n\n\"The marriage will settle everything,\" said Ursula with confidence.\n\n\"It's got to,\" said he grimly.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThe next day or the next but one Dorothy telephoned him. He often called\nher up on one pretext or another, or frankly for no reason at all beyond\nthe overwhelming desire to hear her voice. But she had never before\n\"disturbed\" him. He had again and again assured her that he would not\nregard himself as \"disturbed,\" no matter what he might be doing. She\nwould not have it so. As he was always watching for some faint sign that\nshe was really interested in him, this call gave him a thrill of hope--a\nspecimen of the minor absurdities of those days of extravagant folly.\n\n\"Are you coming over to-day?\" she asked.\n\n\"Right away, if you wish.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Any time will do.\"\n\n\"I'll come at once. I'm not busy.\"\n\n\"No. Late this afternoon. Father asked me to call up and make sure. He\nwants to see you.\"\n\n\"Oh--not you?\"\n\n\"I'm a business person,\" retorted she. \"I know better than to annoy you,\nas I've often said.\"\n\nHe knew it was foolish, tiresome; yet he could not resist the impulse to\nsay, \"Now that I've heard your voice I can't stay away. I'll come over\nto lunch.\"\n\nHer answering voice was irritated. \"Please don't. I'm cleaning house.\nYou'd be in the way.\"\n\nHe shrank and quivered like a boy who has been publicly rebuked. \"I'll\ncome when you say,\" he replied.\n\n\"Not a minute before four o'clock.\"\n\n\"That's a long time--now you've made me crazy to see you.\"\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I must go back to work.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked, to detain her.\n\n\"Dusting and polishing. Molly did the sweeping and is cleaning windows\nnow.\"\n\n\"What have you got on?\"\n\n\"How silly you are!\"\n\n\"No one knows that better than I. But I want to have a picture of you to\nlook at.\"\n\n\"I've got on an old white skirt and an old shirt waist, both dirty, and\na pair of tennis shoes that were white once but are gray now, where they\naren't black. And I've got a pink chiffon rag tied round my hair.\"\n\n\"Pink is wonderful when you wear it.\"\n\n\"I look a fright. And my face is streaked--and my arms.\"\n\n\"Oh, you've got your sleeves rolled up. That's an important detail.\"\n\n\"You're making fun of me.\"\n\n\"No, I'm thinking of your arms. They are--ravishing.\"\n\n\"That's quite enough. Good-by.\"\n\nAnd she rang off. He was used to her treating compliment and flattery\nfrom him in that fashion. He could not--or was it would not?--understand\nwhy. He had learned that she was not at all the indifferent and unaware\nperson in the matter of her physical charms he had at first fancied her.\nOn the contrary, she had more than her share of physical vanity--not\nmore than was her right, in view of her charms, but more than she could\ncarry off well. With many a secret smile he had observed that she\nthought herself perfect physically. This did not repel him; it never\ndoes repel a man--when and so long as he is under the enchantment of the\ncharms the woman more or less exaggerates. But, while he had often seen\nwomen with inordinate physical vanity, so often that he had come to\nregarding it as an essential part of feminine character, never before\nhad he seen one so content with her own good opinion of herself that she\nwas indifferent to appreciation from others.\n\nHe did not go back to the office after lunch. Several important matters\nwere coming up; if he got within reach they might conspire to make it\nimpossible for him to be with her on time. If his partners, his clients\nknew! He the important man of affairs kneeling at the feet of a\nnobody!--and why? Chiefly because he was unable to convince her that he\namounted to anything. His folly nauseated him. He sat in a corner in the\ndining room of the Lawyers' Club and drank one whisky and soda after\nanother and brooded over his follies and his unhappiness, muttering\nmonotonously from time to time: \"No wonder she makes a fool of me. I\ninvite it, I beg for it, damned idiot that I am!\" By three o'clock he\nhad drunk enough liquor to have dispatched the average man for several\ndays. It had produced no effect upon him beyond possibly a slight\naggravation of his moodiness.\n\nIt took only twenty minutes to get from New York to her house. He set\nout at a few minutes after three; arrived at twenty minutes to four. As\nexperience of her ways had taught him that she was much less friendly\nwhen he disobeyed her requests, he did not dare go to the house, but,\nafter looking at it from a corner two blocks away, made a detour that\nwould use up some of the time he had to waste. And as he wandered he\nindulged in his usual alternations between self-derision and passion. He\nappeared at the house at five minutes to four. Patrick, who with Molly\nhis wife looked after the domestic affairs, was at the front gate gazing\ndown the street in the direction from which he always came. At sight of\nhim Pat came running. Norman quickened his pace, and every part of his\nnervous system was in turmoil.\n\n\"Mr. Hallowell--he's--_dead_,\" gasped Pat.\n\n\"Dead?\" echoed Norman.\n\n\"Three quarters of an hour ago, sir. He came from the lobatry, walked in\nthe sitting room where Miss Dorothy was oiling the furniture and I was\noiling the floor. And he sets down--and he looks at her--as cool and\ncalm as could be--and he says, 'Dorothy, my child, I'm dying.' And she\nstands up straight and looks at him curious like--just curious like. And\nhe says, 'Dorothy, good-by.' And he shivers, and I jumps up just in time\nto catch him from rolling to the floor. He was dead then--so the doctor\nsays.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" repeated Norman, looking round vaguely.\n\nHe went on to the house, Pat walking beside him and chattering on and\non--a stream of words Norman did not hear. As he entered the open front\ndoor Dorothy came down the stairs. He had thought he knew how white her\nskin was. But he did not know until then. And from that ghostly pallor\nlooked the eyes of grief beyond tears. He advanced toward her. But she\nseemed to be wrapped in an atmosphere of aloofness. He felt himself a\nstranger and an alien. After a brief silence she said: \"I don't realize\nit. I've been upstairs where Pat carried him--but I don't realize it. It\nsimply can't be.\"\n\n\"Do you know what he wished to say to me?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. I guess he felt this coming. Probably it came quicker than he\nexpected. Now I can see that he hasn't been well for several days. But\nhe would never let anything about illness be said. He thought talking of\nthose things made them worse.\"\n\n\"You have relatives--somebody you wish me to telegraph?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No one. Our relatives out West are second cousins\nor further away. They care nothing about us. No, I'm all alone.\"\n\nThe tears sprang to his eyes. But there were no tears in her eyes, no\nforlornness in her voice. She was simply stating a fact. He said: \"I'll\nlook after everything. Don't give it a moment's thought.\"\n\n\"No, I'll arrange,\" replied she. \"It'll give me something to\ndo--something to do for him. You see, it's my last chance.\" And she\nturned to ascend the stairs. \"Something to do,\" she repeated dully. \"I\nwish I hadn't cleaned house this morning. That would be something more\nto do.\"\n\nThis jarred on him--then brought the tears to his eyes again. How\nchildish she was!--and how desolate! \"But you'll let me stay?\" he\npleaded. \"You'll need me. At any rate, I want to feel that you do.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you didn't stay,\" she said, in the same calm, remote way.\n\"I'd rather be alone with him, this last time. I'll go up and sit there\nuntil they take him away. And then--in a few days I'll see what to\ndo--I'll send for you.\"\n\n\"I can't leave you at such a time,\" he cried. \"You haven't realized yet.\nWhen you do you will need some one.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she interrupted. \"He and I understood each other\nin some ways. I know he'd not want--anyone round.\"\n\nAt her slight hesitation before \"anyone\" he winced.\n\n\"I must be alone with him,\" she went on. \"Thank you, but I want to go\nnow.\"\n\n\"Not just yet,\" he begged. Then, seeing the shadow of annoyance on her\nbeautiful white face, he rose and said: \"I'm going. I only want to help\nyou.\" He extended his hand impulsively, drew it back before she had the\nchance to refuse it. For he felt that she would refuse it. He said, \"You\nknow you can rely on me.\"\n\n\"But I don't need anybody,\" replied she. \"Good-by.\"\n\n\"If I can do anything----\"\n\n\"Pat will telephone.\" She was already halfway upstairs.\n\nHe found Pat in the front yard, and arranged with him to get news and to\nsend messages by way of the drug store at the corner, so that she would\nknow nothing about it. He went to a florist's in New York and sent\nmasses of flowers. And then--there was nothing more to do. He stopped in\nat the club and drank and gambled until far into the morning. He fretted\ngloomily about all the next day, riding alone in the Park, driving with\nhis sister, drinking and gambling at the club again and smiling\ncynically to himself at the covert glances his acquaintances exchanged.\nHe was growing used to those glances. He cared not the flip of a penny\nfor them.\n\nOn the third day came the funeral, and he went. He did not let his\ncabman turn in behind the one carriage that followed the hearse. At the\ngraveyard he stood afar off, watching her in her simple new black,\nnoting her calm. She seemed thinner, but he thought it might be simply\nher black dress. He could see no change in her face. As she was leaving\nthe grave, she looked in his direction but he was uncertain whether she\nhad seen him. Pat and Molly were in the big, gloomy looking carriage\nwith her.\n\nHe ventured to go to the front gate an hour later. Pat came out. \"It's\nno use to go in, Mr. Norman,\" he said. \"She'll not see you. She's shut\nup in her own room.\"\n\n\"Hasn't she cried yet, Pat?\"\n\n\"Not yet. We're waiting for it, sir. We're afraid her mind will give\nway. At least, Molly is. I don't think so. She's a queer young lady--as\nqueer as she looks--though at first you'd never think it. She's always\nlooking different. I never seen so many persons in one.\"\n\n\"Can't Molly _make_ her cry?--by talking about him?\"\n\n\"She's tried, sir. It wasn't no use. Why, Miss Dorothy talks about him\njust as if he was still here.\" Pat wiped the sweat from his forehead.\n\"I've been in many a house of mourning, but never through such a strain\nas this. Somehow I feel as if I'd never before been round where there\nwas anyone that'd lost somebody they _really_ cared about. Weeping and\nmoaning don't amount to much beside what she's doing.\"\n\nNorman stayed round for an hour or more, then rushed away distracted. He\ndrank like a madman--drank himself into a daze, and so got a few hours\nof a kind of sleep. He was looking haggard and wild now, and everyone\navoided him, though in fact there was not the least danger of an\noutburst of temper. His sister--Josephine--the office--several clients\ntelephoned for him. To all he sent the same refusal--that he was too ill\nto see anyone. Not until the third day after the funeral did Dorothy\ntelephone for him.\n\nHe took an ice-cold bath, got himself together as well as he could, and\nreached the house in Jersey City about half past three in the afternoon.\nShe came gliding into the room like a ghost, trailing a black negligee\nthat made the whiteness of her skin startling. Her eyelids were heavy\nand dark, but unreddened. She gazed at him with calm, clear melancholy,\nand his heart throbbed and ached for her. She seated herself, clasped\nher hands loosely in her lap, and said:\n\n\"I've sent for you so that I could settle things up.\"\n\n\"Your father's affairs? Can't I do it better?\"\n\n\"He had arranged everything. There are only the papers--his notes--and\nhe wrote out the addresses of the men they were to be sent to. No, I\nmean settle things up with you.\"\n\n\"You mustn't bother about that,\" said he. \"Besides, there's nothing to\nsettle.\"\n\n\"I shan't pretend I'm going to try to pay you back,\" she went on, as if\nhe had not spoken. \"I never could do it. But you will get part at least\nby selling this furniture and the things at the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Dorothy--please,\" he implored. \"Don't you understand you're to stay on\nhere, just the same? What sort of man do you think I am? I did this for\nyou, and you know it.\"\n\n\"But I did it for my father,\" replied she, \"and he's gone.\" She was\nresting her melancholy gaze upon him. \"I couldn't take anything from\nyou. You didn't think I was that kind?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"I cared nothing about the scandal--what people said--so long as I was\ndoing it for him. . . . I'd have done _anything_ for him. Sometimes I\nthought you were going to compel me to do things I'd have hated to do. I\nhope I wronged you, but I feared you meant that.\" She sat thinking\nseveral minutes, sighed wearily. \"It's all over now. It doesn't matter.\nI needn't bother about it any more.\"\n\n\"Dorothy, let's not talk of these things now,\" said Norman. \"There's no\nhurry. I want you to wait until you are calm and have thought everything\nover. Then I'm sure you'll see that you ought to stay on.\"\n\n\"How could I?\" she asked wonderingly.\n\n\"Why not? Am I demanding anything of you? You know I'm not--and that I\nnever shall.\"\n\n\"But there's no reason on earth why _you_ should support _me_. I can work.\nWhy shouldn't I? And if I didn't, if I stayed on here, what sort of\nwoman would I be?\"\n\nHe was unable to find an answer. He was trying not to see a look in her\nface--or was it in her soul, revealed through her eyes?--a look that\nmade him think for the first time of a resemblance between her and her\nfather.\n\n\"You see yourself I've got to go. Any money I could earn wouldn't more\nthan pay for a room and board somewhere.\"\n\n\"You can let me advance you money while you--\" He hesitated, had an idea\nwhich he welcomed eagerly--\"while you study for the stage. Yes, that's\nthe sensible thing. You can learn to act. Then you will be able to make\na decent living.\"\n\nShe slowly shook her head. \"I've no talent for it--and no liking. No,\nMr. Norman, I must go back to work--and right away.\"\n\n\"But at least wait until you've looked into the stage business,\" he\nurged. \"You may find that you like it and that you have talent for it.\"\n\n\"I can't take any more from you,\" she said.\n\n\"You think I am not to be trusted. I'm not going to say now how I feel\ntoward you. But I can honestly say one thing. Now that you are all alone\nand unprotected, you needn't have the least fear of me.\"\n\nShe smiled faintly. \"I see you don't believe me. Well, it doesn't\nmatter. I've seen Mr. Tetlow and he has given me a place at twelve a\nweek in his office.\"\n\nNorman sank back in his chair. \"He is in for himself now?\"\n\n\"No. He's head clerk for Pitchley & Culver.\"\n\n\"Culver!\" exclaimed Norman. \"I don't want you to go into Culver's\noffice. He's a scoundrel.\"\n\nAgain Dorothy smiled faintly. Norman colored. \"I know he stands well--as\nwell as I do. But I can't trust you with him. That sounds ridiculous\nbut--it's true.\"\n\n\"I think I can trust myself,\" she said quietly. Her grave regard fixed\nhis. \"Don't you?\" she asked.\n\nHis eyes lowered. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"But--why shouldn't you come back\nwith us? I'll see that you get a much better position than Culver's\ngiving you.\"\n\nOver her face crept one of those mysterious transformations that made\nher so bafflingly fascinating to him. Behind that worldly-wise,\nsatirical mask was she mocking at him? All she said was: \"I couldn't\nwork there. I've settled it with Mr. Tetlow. I go to work to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\" he cried, starting up.\n\n\"And I've found a place to live. Pat and Molly; will take care of things\nfor you here.\"\n\n\"Dorothy! You don't _mean_ this? You're not going to break off?\"\n\n\"I shan't see you again--except as we may meet by accident.\"\n\n\"Do you realize what you're saying means to me?\" he cried. \"Don't you\nknow how I love you?\" He advanced toward her. She stood and waited\npassively, looking at him. \"Dorothy--my love--do you want to kill me?\"\n\n\"When are you to be married?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"You are playing with me!\" he cried. \"You are tormenting me. What have I\never done that you should treat me this way?\" He caught her unresisting\nhands and kissed them. \"Dear--my dear--don't you care for me at all?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said placidly. \"I've always told you so.\"\n\nHe seized her in his arms, kissed her with a frenzy that was savage,\nferocious. \"You will drive me mad. You _have_ driven me mad!\" he muttered.\nAnd he added, unconscious that he was speaking his thoughts, so\ndistracted was he: \"You _must_ love me--you _must_! No woman has ever\nresisted me. You cannot.\"\n\nShe drew herself away from him, stood before him like snow, like ice.\n\"One thing I have never told you. I'll tell you now,\" she said\ndeliberately. \"I despise you.\"\n\nHe fell back a step and the chill of her coldness seemed to be freezing\nthe blood in his veins.\n\n\"I've always despised you,\" she went on, and he shivered before that\ncontemptuous word--it seemed only the more contemptuous for her\ncalmness. \"Sometimes I've despised you thoroughly--again only a\nlittle--but always that feeling.\"\n\nFor a moment he thought she had at last stung his pride into the\nsemblance of haughtiness. He was able to look at her with mocking eyes\nand to say, \"I congratulate you on your cleverness in concealing your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my cleverness,\" she said wearily. \"It was your blindness. I\nnever deceived you.\"\n\n\"No, you never have,\" he replied sincerely. \"Perhaps I deserve to be\ndespised. Again, perhaps if you knew the world--the one I live\nin--better, you'd think less harshly of me.\"\n\n\"I don't think harshly of you. How could I--after all you did for my\nfather?\"\n\n\"Dorothy, if you'll stay here and study for the stage--or anything you\nchoose--I promise you I'll never speak of my feeling for you--or show it\nin any way--unless you yourself give me leave.\"\n\nShe smiled with childlike pathos. \"You ought not to tempt me. Do you\nwant me to keep on despising you? Can't you ever be fair with me?\"\n\nThe sad, frank gentleness of the appeal swung his unhinged mind to the\nother extreme--from the savagery of passion to a frenzy of remorse.\n\"Fair to _you_? No,\" he cried, \"because I love you. Oh, I'm\nashamed--bitterly ashamed. I'm capable of any baseness to get you.\nYou're right. You can't trust me. In going you're saving me from\nmyself.\" He hesitated, stared wildly, appalled at the words that were\nfighting for utterance--the words about marriage--about marrying her! He\nsaid hoarsely: \"I am mad--mad! I don't know what I'm saying.\nGood-by--For God's sake, don't think the worst of me, Dorothy. Good-by.\nI _will_ be a man again--I will!\"\n\nAnd he wrung her hand and, talking incoherently, he rushed from the room\nand from the house.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nHe went straight home and sought his sister. She had that moment come in\nfrom tea after a matinee. She talked about the play--how badly it was\nacted--and about the women she had seen at tea--how badly dressed they\nwere. \"It's hard to say which is the more dreadful--the ugly, misshapen\nhuman race without clothes or in the clothes it insists on wearing. And\nthe talk at that tea! Does no one ever say a pleasant thing about\nanyone? Doesn't anyone ever do a pleasant thing that can be spoken\nabout? I read this morning Tolstoy's advice about resolving to think all\nday only nice thoughts and sticking to it. That sounded good to me, and\nI decided to try it.\" Ursula laughed and squirmed about in her\ntight-fitting dress that made an enchanting display of her figure. \"What\nis one to do? _I_ can't be a fraud, for one. And if I had stuck to my\nresolution I'd have spent the day in lying. What's the matter, Fred?\"\nNow that her attention was attracted she observed more closely. \"What\n_have_ you been doing? You look--frightful!\"\n\n\"I've broken with her,\" replied he.\n\n\"With Jo?\" she cried. \"Why, Fred, you can't--you can't--with the\nwedding only five days away!\"\n\n\"Not with Jo.\"\n\nUrsula breathed noisy relief. She said cheerfully: \"Oh--with the other.\nWell, I'm glad it's over.\"\n\n\"Over?\" said he sardonically. \"Over? It's only begun.\"\n\n\"But you'll stick it out, Fred. You've made a fool of yourself long\nenough. What was the girl playing for? Marriage?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I guess so.\" He laughed curtly. \"And she almost won.\"\n\nUrsula smiled with fine mockery. \"Almost, but not quite. I know you men.\nWomen do that sort of fool thing. But men--never--at least not the\nambitious, snobbish New York men.\"\n\n\"She almost won,\" he repeated. \"At least, I almost did it. If I had\nstayed a minute longer I'd have done it.\"\n\n\"You like to think you would,\" mocked Ursula. \"But if you had tried to\nsay the words your lungs would have collapsed, your vocal chords snapped\nand your tongue shriveled.\"\n\n\"I am not so damn sure I shan't do it yet,\" he burst out fiercely.\n\n\"But I am,\" said Ursula, calm, brisk, practical. \"What's she going to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Going to work.\"\n\nUrsula laughed joyously. \"What a joke! A woman go to work when she\nneedn't!\"\n\n\"She is going to work.\"\n\n\"To work another man.\"\n\n\"She meant it.\"\n\n\"How easily women fool men!--even the wise men like you.\"\n\n\"She meant it.\"\n\n\"She still hopes to marry you--or she has heard of your marriage----\"\n\nNorman lifted his head. Into his face came the cynical, suspicious\nexpression.\n\n\"And has fastened on some other man. Or perhaps she's found some good\nprovider who's willing to marry her.\"\n\nNorman sprang up, his eyes blazing, his mouth working cruelly. \"By God!\"\nhe cried. \"If I thought that!\"\n\nHis sister was alarmed. Such a man--in such a delirium--might commit any\nabsurdity. He flung himself down in despair. \"Urse, why can't I get rid\nof this thing? It's ruining me. It's killing me!\"\n\n\"Your good sense tells you if you had her you'd be over it--\" She\nsnapped her fingers--\"like that.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--I know it! But--\" He groaned--\"she has broken with me.\"\n\nUrsula went to him and kissed him and took his head in her arms. \"What a\n_boy_-boy it is!\" she said tenderly. \"Oh, it must be dreadful to have\nalways had whatever one wanted and then to find something one can't\nhave. We women are used to it--and the usual sort of man. But not your\nsort, Freddy--and I'm so sorry for you.\"\n\n\"I want her, Urse--I want her,\" he groaned, and he was almost sobbing.\n\"My God, I _can't_ get on without her.\"\n\n\"Now, Freddy dear, listen to me. You know she's 'way, 'way beneath\nyou--that she isn't at all what you've got in the habit of picturing\nher--that it's all delusion and nonsense----\"\n\n\"I want her,\" he repeated. \"I want her.\"\n\n\"You'd be ashamed if you had her as a wife--wouldn't you?\"\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"She isn't a _lady_.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied he.\n\n\"She hasn't any sense. A low sort of cunning, yes. But not brains--not\nenough to hold you.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied he. \"She's got enough for a woman. And--I _want_\nher.\"\n\n\"She isn't to be compared with Josephine.\"\n\n\"But I don't want Josephine. I want _her_.\"\n\n\"But which do you want to _marry_?--to bring forward as your wife?--to\nspend your life with?\"\n\n\"I know. I'm a mad fool. But, Urse, I can't help it.\" He stood up\nsuddenly. \"I've used every weapon I've got. Even pride--and it skulked\naway. My sense of humor--and it weakened. My will--and it snapped.\"\n\n\"Is she so wonderful?\"\n\n\"She is so--elusive. I can't understand her--I can't touch her. I can't\nfind her. She keeps me going like a man chasing an echo.\"\n\n\"Like a man chasing an echo,\" repeated Ursula reflectively. \"I\nunderstand. It is maddening. She must be clever--in her way.\"\n\n\"Or very simple. God knows which; I don't--and sometimes I think she\ndoesn't, either.\" He made a gesture of dismissal. \"Well, it's finished.\nI must pull myself together--or try to.\"\n\n\"You will,\" said his sister confidently. \"A fortnight from now you'll be\nlaughing at yourself.\"\n\n\"I am now. I have been all along. But--it does no good.\"\n\nShe had to go and dress. But she could not leave until she had tried to\nmake him comfortable. He was drinking brandy and soda and staring at his\nfeet which were stretched straight out toward the fire. \"Where's your\nsense of humor?\" she demanded. \"Throw yourself on your sense of humor.\nIt's a friend that sticks when all others fail.\"\n\n\"It's my only hope,\" he said with a grim smile. \"I can see myself. No\nwonder she despises me.\"\n\n\"Despises you?\" scoffed Ursula. \"A _woman_ despise _you_! She's crazy\nabout you, I'll bet anything you like. Before you're through with this\nyou'll find out I'm right. And then--you'll have no use for her.\"\n\n\"She despises me.\"\n\n\"Well--what of it? Really, Fred, it irritates me to see you absolutely\nunlike yourself. Why, you're as broken-spirited as a henpecked old\nhusband.\"\n\n\"Just that,\" he admitted, rising and looking drearily about. \"I don't\nknow what the devil to do next. Everything seems to have stopped.\"\n\n\"Going to see Josephine this evening?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" was his indifferent reply.\n\n\"You'll have to dress after dinner. There's no time now.\"\n\n\"Dress?\" he inquired vaguely. \"Why dress? Why do anything?\"\n\nShe thought he would not go to Josephine but would hide in his club and\ndrink. But she was mistaken. Toward nine o'clock he, in evening dress,\nwith the expression of a horse in a treadmill, rang the bell of\nJosephine's house and passed in at the big bronze doors. The butler must\nhave particularly admired the way he tossed aside his coat and hat. As\nsoon as he was in the presence of his fiancee he saw that she was again\nin the throes of some violent agitation.\n\nShe began at once: \"I've just had the most frightful scene with father,\"\nshe said. \"He's been hearing a lot of stuff about you down town and it\nset him wild.\"\n\n\"Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?\" said he, looking at her unseeingly\nwith haggard, cold eyes. \"And may I have some whisky?\"\n\nShe rang. \"I hope the servants didn't hear him,\" she said. Then, as a\nstep sounded outside she put on an air of gayety, as if she were still\nlaughing at some jest he had made. In the doorway appeared her father\none of those big men who win half the battle in advance on personal\nappearance of unconquerable might. Burroughs was noted for his\ngenerosity and for his violent temper. As a rule men of the largeness\nnecessary to handling large affairs are free from petty vindictiveness.\nThey are too busy for hatred. They do not forgive; they are most careful\nnot to forget; they simply stand ready at any moment to do whatever it\nis to their interest to do, regardless of friendships or animosities.\nBurroughs was an exception in that he got his highest pleasure out of\npursuing his enemies. He enjoyed this so keenly that several times--so\nit was said--he had sacrificed real money to satisfy a revenge. But\nthese rumors may have wronged him. It is hardly probable that a man who\nwould let a weakness carry him to that pitch of folly could have escaped\ndestruction. For of all the follies revenge is the most dangerous--as\nwell as the most fatuous.\n\nBurroughs had a big face. Had he looked less powerful the bigness of his\nfeatures, the spread of cheek and jowl, would have been grotesque. As it\nwas, the face was impressive, especially when one recalled how many,\nmany millions he owned and how many more he controlled. The control was\nbetter than the ownership. The millions he owned made him a coward--he\nwas afraid he might lose them. The millions he controlled, and of course\nused for his own enrichment, made him brave, for if they were lost in\nthe daring ventures in which he freely staked them, why, the loss was\nnot his, and he could shift the blame. Usually Norman treated him with\ngreat respect, for his business gave the firm nearly half its total\nincome, and it was his daughter and his wealth, prestige and power, that\nNorman was marrying. But this evening he looked at the great man with a\nsuperciliousness that was peculiarly disrespectful from so young a man\nto one well advanced toward old age. Norman had been feeling relaxed,\nlanguid, exhausted. The signs of battle in that powerful face nerved\nhim, keyed him up at once. He waited with a joyful impatience while the\nservant was bringing cigars and whisky. The enormous quantities of\nliquor he had drunk in the last few days had not been without effect.\nAlcohol, the general stimulant, inevitably brings out in strong relief a\nman's dominant qualities. The dominant quality of Norman was love of\ncombat.\n\n\"Josephine tells me you are in a blue fury,\" said Norman pleasantly when\nthe door was closed and the three were alone. \"No--not a blue fury. A\nblack fury.\"\n\nAt the covert insolence of his tone Josephine became violently agitated.\n\"Father,\" she said, with the imperiousness of an only and indulged\nchild, \"I have asked you not to interfere between Fred and me. I thought\nI had your promise.\"\n\n\"I said I'd think about it,\" replied her father. He had a heavy voice\nthat now and then awoke some string of the lower octaves of the piano in\nthe corner to a dismal groan. \"I've decided to speak out.\"\n\n\"That's right, sir,\" said Norman. \"Is your quarrel with me?\"\n\nJosephine attempted an easy laugh. \"It's that silly story we were\ntalking about the other day, Fred.\"\n\n\"I supposed so,\" said he. \"You are not smoking, Mr. Burroughs--\" He\nlaughed amiably--\"at least not a cigar.\"\n\n\"The doctor only allows me one, and I've had it,\" replied Burroughs, his\neyes sparkling viciously at this flick of the whip. \"What is the truth\nabout that business, Norman?\"\n\nNorman's amused glance encountered the savage glare mockingly. \"Why do\nyou ask?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Because my daughter's happiness is at stake. Because I cannot but\nresent a low scandal about a man who wishes to marry my daughter.\"\n\n\"Very proper, sir,\" said Norman graciously.\n\n\"My daughter,\" continued Burroughs with accelerating anger, \"tells me\nyou have denied the story.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'Father ... I have asked you not to interfere between\nFred and me.'\"]\n\nNorman interrupted with an astonished look at Josephine. She colored,\ngazed at him imploringly. His face terrified her. When body and mind are\nin health and at rest the fullness of the face hides the character to a\ngreat extent. But when a human being is sick or very tired the\nconcealing roundness goes and in the clearly marked features the true\ncharacter is revealed. In Norman's face, haggard by his wearing\nemotions, his character stood forth--the traits of strength, of\ntenacity, of inevitable purpose. And Josephine saw and dreaded.\n\n\"But,\" Burroughs went on, \"I have it on the best authority that it is\ntrue.\"\n\nNorman, looking into the fascinating face of danger, was thrilled. \"Then\nyou wish to break off the engagement?\" he said in the gentlest,\nsmoothest tone.\n\nBurroughs brought his fist down on the table--and Norman recognized the\ngesture of the bluffer. \"I wish you to break off with that woman!\" he\ncried. \"I insist upon it--upon positive assurances from you.\"\n\n\"Fred!\" pleaded Josephine. \"Don't listen to him. Remember, I have said\nnothing.\"\n\nHe had long been looking for a justifying grievance against her. It now\nseemed to him that he had found it. \"Why should you?\" he said genially\nbut with subtle irony, \"since you are getting your father to speak for\nyou.\"\n\nThere was just enough truth in this to entangle her and throw her into\ndisorder. She had been afraid of the consequences of her father's\ninterfering with a man so spirited as Norman, but at the same time she\nhad longed to have some one put a check upon him. Norman's suave remark\nmade her feel that he could see into her inmost soul--could see the\nanger, the jealousy, the doubt, the hatred-tinged love, the\nlove-saturated hate seething and warring there.\n\nBurroughs was saying: \"If we had not committed ourselves so deeply, I\nshould deal very differently with this matter.\"\n\n\"Why should that deter you?\" said Norman--and Josephine gave a piteous\ngasp. \"If this goes much farther, I assure you I shall not be deterred.\"\n\nBurroughs, firmly planted in a big leather chair, looked at the young\nman in puzzled amazement. \"I see you think you have us in your power,\"\nhe said at last. \"But you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" rejoined the young man, \"I see you believe you have\nme in your power. And in a sense you are _not_ mistaken.\"\n\n\"Father, he is right,\" cried Josephine agitatedly. \"I shouldn't love and\nrespect him as I do if he would submit to this hectoring.\"\n\n\"Hectoring!\" exclaimed Burroughs. \"Josephine, leave the room. I cannot\ndiscuss this matter properly before you.\"\n\n\"I hope you will not leave, Josephine,\" said Norman. \"There is nothing\nto be said that you cannot and ought not to hear.\"\n\n\"I'm not an infant, father,\" said Josephine. \"Besides, it is as Fred\nsays. He has done nothing--improper.\"\n\n\"Then why does he not say so?\" demanded Burroughs, seeing a chance to\nrecede from his former too advanced position. \"That's all I ask.\"\n\n\"But I told you all about it, father,\" said Josephine angrily. \"They've\nbeen distorting the truth, and the truth is to his credit.\"\n\nNorman avoided the glance she sent to him; it was only a glance and\naway, for more formidably than ever his power was enthroned in his\nhaggard face. He stood with his back to the fire and it was plain that\nthe muscles of his strong figure were braced to give and to receive a\nshock. \"Mr. Burroughs,\" he said, \"your daughter is mistaken. Perhaps it\nis my fault--in having helped her to mislead herself. The plain truth\nis, I have become infatuated with a young woman. She cares nothing about\nme--has repulsed me. I have been and am making a fool of myself about\nher. I've been hoping to cure myself. I still hope. But I am not cured.\"\n\nThere was absolute silence in the room. Norman stole a glance at\nJosephine. She was sitting erect, a greenish pallor over her ghastly\nface.\n\nHe said: \"If she will take me, now that she knows the truth, I shall be\ngrateful--and I shall make what effort I can to do my best.\"\n\nHe looked at her and she at him. And for an instant her eyes softened.\nThere was the appeal of weak human heart to weak human heart in his\ngaze. Her lip quivered. A brief struggle between vanity and love--and\nvanity, the stronger, the strongest force in her life, dominating it\nsince earliest babyhood and only seeming to give way to love when love\ncame--it was vanity that won. She stiffened herself and her mouth curled\nwith proud scorn. She laughed--a sneer of jealous rage. \"Father,\" she\nsaid, \"the lady in the case is a common typewriter in his office.\"\n\nBut to men--especially to practical men--differences of rank and\nposition among women are not fundamentally impressive. Man is in the\nhabit of taking what he wants in the way of womankind wherever he finds\nit, and he understands that habit in other men. He was furious with\nNorman, but he did not sympathize with his daughter's extreme attitude.\nHe said to Norman sharply:\n\n\"You say you have broken with the woman?\"\n\n\"She has broken with me,\" replied Norman.\n\n\"At any rate, everything is broken off.\"\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\n\"Then there is no reason why the marriage should not go on.\" He turned\nto his daughter. \"If you understood men, you would attach no importance\nto this matter. As you yourself said, the woman isn't a lady--isn't in\nour class. That sort of thing amounts to nothing. Norman has acted well.\nHe has shown the highest kind of honesty--has been truthful where most\nmen would have shifted and lied. Anyhow, things have gone too far.\" Not\nwithout the soundest reasons had Burroughs accepted Norman as his\nson-in-law; and he had no fancy for giving him up, when men of his\npre-eminent fitness were so rare.\n\nThere was another profound silence. Josephine looked at Norman. Had he\nreturned her gaze, the event might have been different; for within her\nthere was now going on a struggle between two nearly evenly matched\nvanities--the vanity of her own outraged pride and the vanity of what\nthe world would say and think, if the engagement were broken off at that\ntime and in those circumstances. But he did not look at her. He kept his\neyes fixed upon the opposite wall, and there was no sign of emotion of\nany kind in his stony features. Josephine rose, suppressed a sob, looked\narrogant scorn from eyes shining with tears--tears of self-pity. \"Send\nhim away, father,\" she said. \"He has tried to degrade _me_! I am done with\nhim.\" And she rushed from the room, her father half starting from his\nchair to detain her.\n\nHe turned angrily on Norman. \"A hell of a mess you've made!\" he cried.\n\n\"A hell of a mess,\" replied the young man.\n\n\"Of course she'll come round. But you've got to do your part.\"\n\n\"It's settled,\" said Norman. And he threw his cigar into the fireplace.\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried Burroughs. \"Before you go, you must see Josie alone and\ntalk with her.\"\n\n\"It would be useless,\" said Norman. \"You know her.\"\n\nBurroughs laid his hand friendlily but heavily upon the young man's\nshoulder. \"This outburst of nonsense might cost you two young people\nyour happiness for life. This is no time for jealousy and false pride.\nWait a moment.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Norman. \"But it is useless.\" He understood Josephine\nnow--he who had become a connoisseur of love. He knew that her\nvanity-founded love had vanished.\n\nBurroughs disappeared in the direction his daughter had taken. Norman\nwaited several minutes--long enough slowly to smoke a cigarette. Then he\nwent into the hall and put on his coat with deliberation. No one\nappeared, not even a servant. He went out into the street.\n\nIn the morning papers he found the announcement of the withdrawal of the\ninvitations--and from half a column to several columns of comment, much\nof it extremely unflattering to him.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nWhen a \"high life\" engagement such as that of Norman and Miss Burroughs,\ncollapses on the eve of the wedding, the gossip and the scandal, however\ngreat, are but a small part of the mess. Doubtless many a marriage--and\nnot in high life alone, either--has been put through, although the one\nparty or the other or both have discovered that disaster was\ninevitable--solely because of the appalling muddle the sensible course\nwould precipitate. In the case of the Norman-Burroughs fiasco, there\nwere--to note only a few big items--such difficulties as several car\nloads of presents from all parts of the earth to be returned, a house\nfurnished throughout and equipped to the last scullery maid and stable\nboy to be disposed of, the entire Burroughs domestic economy which had\nbeen reconstructed to be put back upon its former basis.\n\nIt is not surprising that, as Ursula Fitzhugh was credibly informed,\nJosephine almost decided to send for Bob Culver and marry him on the day\nbefore the day appointed for her marriage to Fred. The reason given for\nher not doing this sounded plausible. Culver, despairing of making the\nmatch on which his ambition--and therefore his heart was set--and\nseeing a chance to get suddenly rich, had embarked for a career as a\nblackmailer of corporations. That is, he nosed about for a big\ncorporation stealthily doing or arranging to do some unlawful but highly\nprofitable acts; he bought a few shares of its stock, using a fake\nclient as a blind; he then proceeded to threaten it with exposure,\nexpensive hindrances and the like, unless it bought him off at a huge\nprofit to himself. This business was regarded as most disreputable\nand--thanks to the power of the big corporations over the courts--had\nresulted in the sending of several of its practisers to jail or on hasty\njourneys to foreign climes. But Culver, almost if not quite as good a\nlawyer as Norman, was too clever to be caught in that way. However,\nwhile he was getting very rich rapidly, he was as yet far from rich\nenough to overcome the detestation of old Burroughs, and to be eligible\nfor the daughter.\n\nSo, Josephine sailed away to Europe, with the consolation that her\nfather was so chagrined by the fizzle that he had withdrawn his veto\nupon the purchase of a foreign title--that veto having been the only\nreason she had looked at home for a husband. Strange indeed are the ways\nof love--never stranger than when it comes into contact with the\nvanities of wealth and social position and the other things that cause a\nhuman being to feel that he or she is lifted clear of and high above the\nhuman condition. Josephine had her consolation. For Norman the only\nconsolation was escape from a marriage which had become so irksome in\nanticipation that he did not dare think what it would be in the reality.\nOver against this consolation was set a long list of disasters. He found\nhimself immediately shunned by all his friends. Their professed reason\nwas that he had acted shabbily in the breaking of the engagement; for,\nwhile it was assumed that Josephine must have done the actual breaking,\nit was also assumed that he must have given her provocation and to\nspare. This virtuous indignation was in large part mere pretext, as\nvirtuous indignation in frail mortals toward frail mortals is apt to be.\nThe real reason for shying off from Norman was his atmosphere of\nimpending downfall. And certainly that atmosphere had eaten away and\ndissipated all his former charm. He looked dull and boresome--and he\nwas.\n\nBut the chief disaster was material. As has been said, old Burroughs, in\nhis own person and in the enterprises he controlled, gave Norman's firm\nabout half its income. The day Josephine sailed, Lockyer, senior partner\nof the firm, got an intimation that unless Norman left, Burroughs would\ntake his law business elsewhere, and would \"advise\" others of their\nclients to follow his example. Lockyer no sooner heard than he began to\nbestir himself. He called into consultation the learned Benchley and the\nastute Sanders and the soft and sly Lockyer junior. There could be no\nquestion that Norman must be got rid of. The only point was, who should\ninform the lion that he had been deposed?\n\nAfter several hours of anxious discussion, Lockyer, his inward\nperturbations hid beneath that mask of smug and statesmanlike\nrespectability, entered the lion's den--a sick lion, sick unto death\nprobably, but not a dead lion. \"When you're ready to go uptown,\nFrederick,\" said he in his gentlest, most patriarchal manner, \"let me\nknow. I want to have a little talk with you.\"\n\nNorman, heavy eyed and listless, looked at the handsome old fraud. As he\nlooked something of the piercing quality and something of the humorous\ncame back into his eyes. \"Sit down and say it now,\" said he.\n\n\"I'd prefer to talk where we can be quiet.\"\n\nNorman rang his bell and when an office boy appeared, said \"No one is to\ndisturb me until I ring again.\" Then as the boy withdrew he said to\nLockyer: \"Now, sir, what is it?\"\n\nLockyer strolled to the window, looked out as if searching for something\nhe failed to find, came back to the chair on the opposite side of the\ndesk from Norman, seated himself. \"I don't know how to begin,\" said he.\n\"It is hard to say painful things to anyone I have such an affection for\nas I have for you.\"\n\nNorman pushed a sheet of letter paper across the desk toward his\npartner. \"Perhaps that will help you,\" observed he carelessly.\n\nLockyer put on his nose glasses with the gesture of grace and intellect\nthat was famous. He read--a brief demand for a release from the\npartnership and a request for an immediate settlement. Lockyer blinked\noff his glasses with the gesture that was as famous and as admiringly\nimitated by lesser legal lights as was his gesture of be-spectacling\nhimself. \"This is most astounding, my boy,\" said he. \"It is\nmost--most----\"\n\n\"Gratifying?\" suggested Norman with a sardonic grin.\n\n\"Not in the least, Frederick. The very reverse--the exact reverse.\"\n\nNorman gave a shrug that said \"Why do you persist in those frauds--and\nwith _me_?\" But he did not speak.\n\n\"I know,\" pursued Lockyer, \"that you would not have taken this step\nwithout conclusive reasons. And I shall not venture the impertinence of\nprying or of urging.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Norman drily. \"Now, as to the terms of settlement.\"\n\nLockyer, from observation and from gossip, had a pretty shrewd notion of\nthe state of his young partner's mind, and drew the not unwarranted\nconclusion that he would be indifferent about terms--would be \"easy.\"\nWith the suavity of Mr. Great-and-Good-Heart he said: \"My dear boy,\nthere can't be any question of money with us. We'll do the generously\nfair thing--for, we're not hucksterers but gentlemen.\"\n\n\"That sounds terrifying,\" observed the young man, with a faint ironic\nsmile. \"I feel my shirt going and the cold winds whistling about my bare\nbody. To save time, let _me_ state the terms. You want to be rid of me. I\nwant to go. It's a whim with me. It's a necessity for you.\"\n\nLockyer shifted uneasily at these evidences of unimpaired mentality and\nundaunted spirit.\n\n\"Here are my terms,\" proceeded Norman. \"You are to pay me forty thousand\na year for five years--unless I open an office or join another firm. In\nthat case, payments are to cease from the date of my re-entering\npractice.\"\n\nLockyer leaned back and laughed benignantly. \"My dear Norman,\" he said\nwith a gently remonstrant shake of the head, \"those terms are\nimpossible. Forty thousand a year! Why that is within ten thousand of\nthe present share of any of us but you. It is the income of nearly three\nquarters of a million at six per cent--of a million at four per cent!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Norman, settling back in his chair. \"Then I stand\npat.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear Norman, permit me to propose terms that are fair to\nall----\"\n\n\"When I said I stood pat I meant that I would stay on.\" His eyes laughed\nat Lockyer. \"I guess we can live without Burroughs and his dependents.\nMaybe they will find they can't live without us.\" He slowly leaned\nforward until, with his forearms against the edge of his desk, he was\nconcentrating a memorable gaze upon Lockyer. \"Mr. Lockyer,\" said he, \"I\nhave been exercising my privilege as a free man to make a damn fool of\nmyself. I shall continue to exercise it so long as I feel disposed that\nway. But let me tell you something. I can afford to do it. If a man's\nasset is money, or character or position or relatives and friends or\npopular favor or any other perishable article, he must take care how he\ntrifles with it. He may find himself irretrievably ruined. But my asset\nhappens to be none of those things. It is one that can be lost or\ndamaged only by insanity or death. Do you follow me?\"\n\nThe old man looked at him with the sincere and most flattering tribute\nof compelled admiration. \"What a mind you've got, Frederick--and what\ncourage!\"\n\n\"You accept my terms?\"\n\n\"If the others agree--and I think they will.\"\n\n\"They will,\" said Norman.\n\nThe old man was regarding him with eyes that had genuine anxiety in\nthem. \"Why _do_ you do it, Fred?\" he said.\n\n\"Because I wish to be free,\" replied Norman. He would never have told\nthe full truth to that incredulous old cynic of a time-server--the truth\nthat he was resigning at the dictation of a pride which forbade him to\ninvolve others in the ruin he, in his madness, was bent upon.\n\n\"I don't mean, why do you resign,\" said Lockyer. \"I mean the\nother--the--woman.\"\n\nNorman laughed harshly.\n\n\"I've seen too much of the world not to understand,\" continued Lockyer.\n\"The measureless power of woman over man--especially--pardon me, my dear\nNorman--especially a bad woman!\"\n\n\"The measureless power of a man's imagination over himself,\" rejoined\nNorman. \"Did you ever see or hear of a man without imagination being\nupset by a woman? It's in here, Mr. Lockyer\"--he rapped his\nforehead--\"altogether in here.\"\n\n\"You realize that. Yet you go on--and for such a--pardon me, my boy,\nfor saying it--for such a trifling object.\"\n\n\"What does 'trifling' mean, sir?\" replied the young man. \"What is\ntrifling and what is important? It depends upon the point of view. What\nI want--that is vital. What I do not want--that is paltry. It's my\nnature to go for what I happen to want--to go for it with all there is\nin me. I will take nothing else--nothing else.\"\n\nThere was in his eyes the glitter called insanity--the glitter that\nreflects the state of mind of any strong man when possessed of one of\nthose fixed ideas that are the idiosyncrasy of the strong. It would have\nbeen impossible for Lockyer to be possessed in that way; he had not the\ncourage nor the concentration nor the independence of soul; like most\nmen, even able men, he dealt only in the conventional. Not in his\nwildest youth could he have wrecked or injured himself for a woman;\nwomen, for him, occupied their conventional place in the scheme of\nthings, and had no allure beyond the conventionally proper and the\nconventionally improper--for, be it remembered, vice has its beaten\ntrack no less than virtue and most of the vicious are as tame and\nunimaginative as the plodders in the high roads of propriety. Still,\nLockyer had associated with strong men, men of boundless desires; thus,\nhe could in a measure sympathize with his young associate. What a pity\nthat these splendid powers should be perverted from the ordinary desires\nof strong men!\n\nNorman rose, to end the interview. \"My address is my house. They will\nforward--if I go away.\"\n\nLockyer gave him a hearty handclasp, made a few phrases about good\nwishes and the like, left him alone. The general opinion was that Norman\nwas done for. But Lockyer could not see it. He had seen too many men\nfall only to rise out of lowest depths to greater heights than they had\nfallen from. And Norman was only thirty-seven. Perhaps this would prove\nto be merely a dip in a securely brilliant career and not a fall at all.\nIn that case--with such a brain, such a genius for the lawlessness of\nthe law, what a laughing on the other side of the mouth there might yet\nbe among young Norman's enemies--and friends!\n\nHe spent most of the next few days--the lunch time, the late afternoon,\nfinally the early morning hours--lurking about the Equitable Building,\nin which were the offices of Pytchley and Culver. As that building had\nentrances on four streets, the best he could do was to walk round and\nround, with an occasional excursion through the corridors and past the\nelevators. He had written her, asking to see her; he had got no answer.\nHe ceased to wait at the elevators after he had twice narrowly escaped\nbeing seen by Tetlow. He was indifferent to Tetlow, except as meeting\nhim might make it harder to see Dorothy. He drank hard. But drink never\naffected him except to make him more grimly tenacious in whatever he had\ndeliberately and soberly resolved. Drink did not explain--neither wholly\nnor in any part--this conduct of his. It, and the more erratic vagaries\nto follow, will seem incredible conduct for a man of Norman's character\nand position to feeble folk with their feeble desires, their dread of\ncriticism and ridicule, their exaggerated and adoring notions of the\nmaster men. In fact, it was the natural outcome of the man's\nnature--arrogant, contemptuous of his fellowmen and of their opinions,\nand, like all the master men, capable of such concentration upon a\ndesire that he would adopt any means, high or low, dignified or the\nreverse, if only it promised to further his end. Fred Norman, at these\nvulgar vigils, took the measure of his own self-abasement to a hair's\nbreadth. But he kept on, with the fever of his infatuation burning like\na delirium, burning higher and deeper with each baffled day.\n\nAt noon, one day, as he swung into Broadway from Cedar street, he ran\nstraight into Tetlow. It was raining and his umbrella caught in\nTetlow's. It was a ludicrous situation, but there was no answering smile\nin his former friend's eyes. Tetlow glowered.\n\n\"I've heard you were hanging about,\" he said. \"How low you have sunk!\"\n\nNorman laughed in his face. \"Poor Tetlow,\" he said. \"I never expected to\nsee you develop into a crusader. And what a Don Quixote you look. Cheer\nup, old man. Don't take it so hard.\"\n\n\"I warn you to keep away from her,\" said Tetlow in subdued, tense tones,\nhis fat face quivering with emotion. \"Hasn't she shown you plainly that\nshe'll have nothing to do with you?\"\n\n\"I want only five minutes' talk with her, Tetlow,\" said Norman, dropping\ninto an almost pleading tone. \"And I guarantee I'll say nothing you\nwouldn't approve, if you heard. You are advising her badly. You are\ndoing her an injury.\"\n\n\"I am protecting her from a scoundrel,\" retorted Tetlow.\n\n\"She'll not thank you for it, when she finds out the truth.\"\n\n\"You can write to her. What a shallow liar you are!\"\n\n\"I cannot write what I must say,\" said Norman. It had never been\ndifficult for him, however provoked, to keep his temper--outwardly.\nTetlow's insults were to him no more than the barkings of a watch dog,\nand one not at all dangerous, but only amusing. \"I must see her. If you\nare her friend, and not merely a jealous, disappointed lover, you'll\nadvise her to see me.\"\n\n\"You shall not see her, if I can help it,\" cried his former friend. \"And\nif you persist in annoying her----\"\n\n\"Don't make futile threats, Tetlow,\" Norman interrupted. \"You've done me\nall the mischief you can do. I see you hate me for the injuries you've\ndone me. That's the way it always is. But I don't hate you. It was at my\nsuggestion that the Lockyer firm is trying to get you back as a\npartner.\" Then, as Tetlow colored--\"Oh, I see you're accepting their\noffer.\"\n\n\"If I had thought----\"\n\n\"Nonsense. You're not a fool. How does it matter whose the hand, if only\nit's a helping hand? And you may be sure they'd never have made you the\noffer if they didn't need you badly. All the credit I claim is having\nthe intelligence to enlighten their stupidity with the right\nsuggestion.\"\n\nIn spite of himself Tetlow was falling under the spell of Norman's\npersonality, of the old and deep admiration the lesser man had for the\ngreater.\n\n\"Norman,\" he said, \"how can you be such a combination of bigness and\npetty deviltry? You are a monster of self-indulgence. It's a God's mercy\nthere aren't more men with your selfishness and your desires.\"\n\nNorman laughed sardonically. \"The difference between me and most men,\"\nsaid he, \"isn't in selfishness or in desires, but in courage. Courage,\nBilly--there's what most of you lack. And even in courage I'm not alone.\nMy sort fill most of the high places.\"\n\nTetlow looked dismal confession of a fear that Norman was right.\n\n\"Yes,\" pursued Norman, \"in this country there are enough wolves to\nattend to pretty nearly all the sheep--though it's amazing how much\nmutton there is.\" With an abrupt shift from raillery, \"You'll help me\nwith her, Billy?\"\n\n\"Why don't you let her alone, Fred?\" pleaded Tetlow. \"It isn't worthy of\nyou--a big man like you. Let her alone, Fred!--the poor child, trying to\nearn her own living in an honest way.\"\n\n\"Let her alone? Tetlow, I shall never let her alone--as long as she and\nI are both alive.\"\n\nThe fat man, with his premature wrinkles and his solemn air of law books\nthat look venerable though fresh from the press, took on an added\npastiness. \"Fred--for God's sake, can't you love her in a noble way--a\nway worthy of you?\"\n\nNorman gave him a penetrating glance. \"Is love--such love as mine--_and_\nyours--\" There Tetlow flushed guiltily--\"is it ever noble?--whatever\nthat means. No, it's human--human. But I'm not trying to harm her. I\ngive you my word. . . . Will you help me--and her?\"\n\nTetlow hesitated. His heavy cheeks quivered. \"I don't trust you,\" he\ncried violently--the violence of a man fighting against an enemy within.\n\"Don't ever speak to me again.\" And he rushed away through the rain,\nknocking umbrellas this way and that.\n\nAbout noon two days later, as Norman was making one of his excursions\npast the Equitable elevators, he saw Bob Culver at the news stand. It so\nhappened that as he recognized Culver, Culver cast in the direction of\nthe elevators the sort of look that betrays a man waiting for a woman.\nUnseen by Culver, Norman stopped short. Into his face blazed the fury of\nsuspicion, jealousy, and hate--one of the cyclones of passion that swept\nhim from time to time and revealed to his own appalled self the full\nintensity of his feeling, the full power of the demon that possessed\nhim. Culver was of those glossy, black men who are beloved of women. He\nwas much handsomer than Norman, who, indeed, was not handsome at all,\nbut was regarded as handsome because he had the air of great\ndistinction. Many times these two young men had been pitted against each\nother in legal battles. Every time Norman had won. Twice they had\ncontended for the favor of the same lady. Each had scored once. But as\nCulver's victory was merely for a very light and empty-headed lady of\nthe stage while he had won Josephine Burroughs away from Culver, the\nbalance was certainly not against him.\n\nAs Norman slipped back and into the cross corridor to avoid meeting\nCulver, Dorothy Hallowell hurried from a just descended elevator and,\nwith a quick, frightened glance toward Culver, in profile, almost ran\ntoward Norman. It was evident that she had only one thought--to escape\nbeing seen by her new employer. When she realized that some one was\nstanding before her and moved to one side to pass, she looked up. \"Oh!\"\nshe gasped, starting back. And then she stood there white and shaking.\n\n\"Is that beast Culver hounding you?\" demanded Norman.\n\nShe recovered herself quickly. With flashing eyes, she cried: \"How dare\nyou! How dare you!\"\n\nNorman, possessed by his rage against Culver, paid no attention. \"If he\ndon't let you alone,\" he said, \"I'll thrash him into a hospital for six\nmonths. You must leave his office at once. You'll not go back there.\"\n\n\"You must be crazy,\" replied she, calm again. \"I've no complaint to make\nof the way I'm being treated. I never was so well off in my life. And\nMr. Culver is very kind and polite.\"\n\n\"You know what that means,\" said Norman harshly.\n\n\"Everyone isn't like you,\" retorted she.\n\nHe was examining her from head to foot, as if to make sure that it was\nshe with no charm missing. He noted that she was much less poorly\ndressed than when she worked for his firm. In those days she often\nlooked dowdy, showed plainly the girl who has to make a hasty toilet in\na small bedroom, with tiny wash-stand and looking-glass, in the early,\ncoldest hours of a cold morning. Now she looked well taken care of\nphysically, not so well, not anything like so well as the women\nuptown--the ladies with nothing to do but make toilettes; still,\nunusually well looked after for a working girl. At first glance after\nthose famished and ravening days of longing for her and seeking her, she\nbefore him in rather dim reality of the obvious office-girl, seemed\ndisappointing. It could not be that this insignificance was the cause of\nall his fever and turmoil. He began to hope that he was recovering, that\nthe cloud of insane desire was clearing from his sky. But a second\nglance killed that hope. For, once more he saw her mystery, her beauties\nthat revealed their perfection and splendor only to the observant.\n\nWhile he looked she was regaining her balance, as the fading color in\nher white skin and the subsidence of the excitement in her eyes\nevidenced. \"Let me pass, please,\" she said coldly--for, she was against\nthe wall with him standing before her in such a way that she could not\ngo until he moved aside.\n\n\"We'll lunch together,\" he said. \"I want to talk with you. Did that\nwell-meaning ass--Tetlow--tell you?\"\n\n\"There is nothing you can say that I wish to hear,\" was her quiet reply.\n\n\"Your eyes--the edges of the lids are red. You have been crying?\"\n\nShe lifted her glance to his and he had the sense of a veil drawing\naside to reveal a desolation. \"For my father,\" she said.\n\nHis face flushed. He looked steadily at her. \"Now that he is gone, you\nhave no one to protect you. I am----\"\n\n\"I need no one,\" said she with a faintly contemptuous smile.\n\n\"You do need some one--and I am going to undertake it.\"\n\nHer face lighted up. He thought it was because of what he had said. But\nshe immediately undeceived him. She said in a tone of delighted relief,\n\"Here comes Mr. Tetlow. You must excuse me.\"\n\n\"Dorothy--listen!\" he cried. \"We are going to be married at once.\"\n\nThe words exploded dizzily in his ears. He assumed they would have a far\nmore powerful effect upon her. But her expression did not change. \"No,\"\nshe said hastily. \"I must go with Mr. Tetlow.\" Tetlow was now at hand,\nhis heavy face almost formidable in its dark ferocity. She said to him:\n\"I was waiting for you. Come on\"\n\nNorman turned eagerly to his former friend. He said: \"Tetlow, I have\njust asked Miss Hallowell to be my wife.\"\n\nTetlow stared. Then pain and despair seemed to flood and ravage his\nwhole body.\n\n\"I told you the other day,\" Norman went on, \"that I was ready to do the\nfair thing. I have just been saying to Miss Hallowell that she must have\nsome one to protect her. You agree with me, don't you?\"\n\nTetlow, fumbling vaguely with his watch chain, gazed straight ahead.\n\"Yes,\" he said with an effort. \"Yes, you are right, Norman. An office is\nno place for an attractive girl as young as she is.\"\n\n\"Has Culver been annoying her?\" inquired Norman.\n\nTetlow started. \"Ah--she's told you--has she? I rather hoped she hadn't\nnoticed or understood.\"\n\nBoth men now looked at the girl. She had shrunk into herself until she\nwas almost as dim and unimpressive, as cipher-like as when Norman first\nbeheld her. Also she seemed at least five years less than her twenty.\n\"Dorothy,\" said Norman, \"you will let me take care of you--won't you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said--and the word carried all the quiet force she was somehow\nable to put into her short, direct answers.\n\nTetlow's pasty sallowness took on a dark red tinge. He looked at her in\nsurprise. \"You don't understand, Miss Dorothy,\" he said. \"He wants to\nmarry you.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" replied she, with the far-away look in her\nblue eyes. \"But I'll not marry him. I despise him. He frightens me. He\nsickens me.\"\n\nNorman clinched his hands and the muscles of his jaw in the effort to\ncontrol himself. \"Dorothy,\" he said, \"I've not acted as I should. Tetlow\nwill tell you that there is good excuse for me. I know you don't\nunderstand about those things--about the ways of the world----\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" she interrupted. \"It's you that don't\nunderstand. I never saw anyone so conceited. Haven't I told you I don't\nlove you, and don't want anything to do with you?\"\n\nTetlow, lover though he was--or perhaps because he was lover, of the\nhopeless kind that loves generously--could not refrain from protest.\nThe girl was flinging away a dazzling future. It wasn't fair to her to\nlet her do it when if she appreciated she would be overwhelmed with joy\nand gratitude. \"I believe you ought to listen to Norman, Miss Dorothy,\"\nhe said pleadingly. \"At any rate, think it over--don't answer right\naway. He is making you an honorable proposal--one that's advantageous in\nevery way----\"\n\nDorothy regarded him with innocent eyes, wide and wondering. \"I didn't\nthink you could talk like that, Mr. Tetlow!\" she exclaimed. \"You heard\nwhat I said to him--about the way I felt. How could I be his wife? He\ntried everything else--and, now, though he's ashamed of it, he's trying\nto get me by marriage. Oh, I understand. I wish I didn't. I'd not feel\nso low.\" She looked at Norman. \"Can't you realize _ever_ that I don't want\nany of the grand things you're so crazy about--that I want something\nvery different--something you could never give me--or get for me?\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything I can do, Dorothy, to make you forget and\nforgive?\" he cried, like a boy, an infatuated boy. \"For God's sake,\nTetlow, help me! Tell her I'm not so rotten as she thinks. I'll be\nanything you like, my darling--_anything_--if only you'll take me. For I\nmust have you. You're the only thing in the world I care for--and,\nwithout you, I've no interest in life--none--none!\"\n\nHe was so impassioned that passersby began to observe them curiously.\nTetlow became uneasy. But Norman and Dorothy were unconscious of what\nwas going on around them. The energy of his passion compelled her,\nthough the passion itself was unwelcome. \"I'm sorry,\" she said gently.\n\"Though you would have hurt me, if you could, I don't want to hurt\nyou. . . . I'm sorry. I can't love you. . . . I'm sorry. Come on, Mr.\nTetlow.\"\n\nNorman stood aside. She and Tetlow went on out of the building. He\nremained in the same place, oblivious of the crowd streaming by, each\nman or woman with a glance at his vacant stare.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThan Fred Norman no man ever had better reason to feel securely\nentrenched upon the heights of success. It was no silly vaunt of\noptimism for him to tell Lockyer that only loss of life or loss of mind\ncould dislodge him. And a few days after Dorothy had extinguished the\nlast spark of hope he got ready to pull himself together and show the\nworld that it was indulging too soon in its hypocritical headshakings\nover his ruin.\n\n\"I am going to open an office of my own at once,\" he said to his sister.\n\nShe did not wish to discourage him, but she could not altogether keep\nher thoughts from her face. She had, in a general way, a clear idea of\nthe complete system of tollgates, duly equipped with strong barriers,\nwhich the mighty few have established across practically all the\nhighroads to material success. Also, she felt in her brother's manner\nand tone a certain profound discouragement, a lack of the unconquerable\nspirit which had carried him so far so speedily. It is not a baseless\nnotion that the man who has never been beaten is often destroyed by his\nfirst reverse. Ursula feared the spell of success had been broken for\nhim.\n\n\"You mean,\" she suggested, with apparent carelessness, \"that you will\ngive up your forty thousand a year?\"\n\nHe made a disdainful gesture. \"I can make more than that,\" said he.\n\"It's a second rate lawyer who can't in this day.\"\n\n\"Of course you can,\" replied she tactfully. \"But why not take a rest\nfirst? Then there's old Burroughs--on the war path. Wouldn't it be wise\nto wait till he calms down?\"\n\n\"If Burroughs or any other man is necessary to me,\" rejoined Fred, \"the\nsooner I find it out the better. I ought to know just where I--I\nmyself--stand.\"\n\n\"No one is necessary to you but yourself,\" said Ursula, proudly and\nsincerely. \"But, Fred--Are you yourself just now?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" admitted he. \"But the way to become so again isn't by\nwaiting but by working.\" An expression of sheer wretchedness came into\nhis listless, heavy eyes. \"Urse, I've got to conquer my weakness now, or\ngo under.\"\n\nShe was eager to hold on to the secure forty thousand a year--for his\nsake no less than for her own. She argued with him with all the\nadroitness of a mind as good in its way as his own. But she could not\nshake his resolution. And she in prudence, desisted when he said\nbitterly: \"I see you've lost confidence in me. Well, I don't blame\nyou. . . . So have I.\" Then after a moment, violently rather than strongly:\n\"But I've got to get it back. If I don't I'm only putting off the\nsmash--a complete smash.\"\n\n\"I don't see quite how it's to be arranged,\" said she, red and\nhesitating. For, she feared he would think her altogether selfish in her\nanxiety. He certainly would have been justified in so thinking; he knew\nhow rarely generosity survived in the woman who leads the soft and idle\nlife.\n\n\"How long can we keep on as we're living now--if there's nothing, or\nlittle, coming in?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed she. She was as poor at finance as he, and had\ncertainly not been improved by his habit of giving her whatever she\nhappened to think was necessary. \"I can't say. Perhaps a few months--I\ndon't know--Not long, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Six months?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. You see--the fact is--I've been rather careless about the\nbills. You're so generous, Fred--and one is so busy in New York. I\nguess we owe a good deal--here and there and yonder. And--the last few\ndays some of the tradespeople have been pressing for payment.\"\n\n\"You see!\" exclaimed he. \"The report is going round that I'm ruined and\ndone for. I've simply got to make good. If you can't keep up a front,\nshut up the house and go abroad. You can stay till I've got my foot back\non its neck.\"\n\nShe believed in him, at bottom. She could not conceive how appearances\nand her forebodings could be true. Such strength as his could not be\noverwhelmed thus suddenly. And by so slight a thing!--by an unsatisfied\npassion for a woman, and an insignificant woman, at that. For, like all\nwomen, like all the world for that matter, she measured a passion by the\nwoman who was the object of it, instead of by the man who fabricated it.\n\"Yes--I'll go abroad,\" said she, hopefully.\n\n\"Quietly arrange for a long stay,\" he advised. \"I _hope_ it won't be long.\nBut I never plan on hope.\"\n\nThus, with his sister and Fitzhugh out of the way and the heaviest of\nhis burdens of expense greatly lightened, he set about rehabitating\nhimself. He took an office, waited for clients. And clients\ncame--excellent clients. Came and precipitately left him.\n\nThere were two reasons for it. The first--the one most often heard--was\nthe story going round that he had been, and probably still was, out of\nhis mind. No deadlier or crueler weapon can be used against a man than\nthat same charge as to his sanity. It has been known to destroy, or\nseriously maim, brilliant and able men with no trace of any of the\nuntrustworthy kinds of insanity. Where the man's own conduct gives color\nto the report, the attack is usually mortal. And Norman had acted the\ncrazy man. The second reason was the hostility of Burroughs, reinforced\nby all the hatreds and jealousies Norman's not too respectful way of\ndealing with his fellow men had been creating through fifteen years.\n\nThe worst moment in the life of a man who has always proudly regarded\nhimself as above any need whatever from his fellow men is when he\ndiscovers all in a flash, that the timid animal he spurned as it fawned\nhas him upon his back, has its teeth and claws at his helpless throat.\n\nFor four months he stood out against the isolation, the suspicion as to\nhis sanity, the patronizing pity of men who but a little while before\nhad felt honored when he spoke to them. For four months he gave battle\nto unseen and silent foes compassing him on every side. He had no spirit\nfor the fight; his love of Dorothy Hallowell and his complete rout there\nhad taken the spirit out of him--and with it had gone that confidence in\nhimself and in his luck which had won him so many critical battles.\nThen--He had been keeping up a large suite of offices, a staff of\nclerks and stenographers and all the paraphernalia of the great and\nsuccessful lawyer. He had been spreading out the little business he got\nin a not unsuccessful effort to make it appear big and growing. He now\ngave up these offices and the costly pride, pomp and circumstance--left\nwith several thousand dollars owing. He took two small rooms in a\nbuilding tenanted by beginners and cheap shysters. He continued to live\nat his club, where even the servants were subtly insolent to him; he\ncould see the time approaching when he might have to let himself be\ndropped for failing to pay dues and bills.\n\nHe stared at his ruin in stupid and dazed amazement. Usually, to hear or\nto read about such a catastrophe as this is to get a vague, rather\nimpressive notion of something picturesque and romantic. Ruined, like\nall the big fateful words, has a dignified sound. But the historians and\nnovelists and poets and other keepers of human records have a pleasant,\nbut not very honest way, of omitting practically all the essentials from\ntheir records and substituting glittering imaginings that delight the\nreader--and wofully mislead him as to the truth about life. What wonder\nthat we learn slowly--and improve slowly. How wofully we have been, and\nare, misled by all upon whom we have relied as teachers.\n\nAlready one of these charming tales of majestic downfall was in process\nof manufacture, with Frederick Norman as the central figure. It was only\nawaiting his suicide or some other mode of complete submergence for its\nfinal glose of glamor. In this manufacture, the truth, as usual, had\nbeen almost omitted; such truth as was retained for this artistic\nversion of a human happening was so perverted that it was falser than\nthe simon pure fictions with which it was interwoven. Just as the\nliteral truth about his success was far from being altogether to his\ncredit, so the literal truth as to his fall gave him little of the\nvesture of the hero, and that little ill fitting, to cover his naked\nhumanness. Let him who has risen to material success altogether by\nmethods approved by the idealists, let him who has fallen from on high\nwith graceful majesty, without hysterical clutchings and desperate\nattempts at self-salvation in disregard of the safety of others--let\neither of these superhuman beings come forward with the first stone for\nNorman.\n\nThose at some distance from the falling man could afford to be romantic\nand piteous over his fate. Those in his dangerous neighborhood were too\nbusy getting out of the way. \"Man falling--stand from under!\" was the\ncry--how familiar it is!--and acquaintances and friends fled in mad\nskedaddle. He would surely be asking favors--would be trying to borrow\nmoney. It is no peculiarity of rats to desert a sinking ship; it is\nsimply an inevitable precaution in a social system modeled as yet upon\nnature's cruel law of the survival of the fittest. A falling man is\nfirst of all a warning to all other men high enough up to be able to\nfall--a warning to them to take care lest they fall also where footing\nis so insecure and precipices and steeps beset every path.\n\nNorman, falling, falling, gazed round him and up and down, in dazed\nwonder. He had seen many others fall. He had seen just where and just\nwhy they missed their footing. And he had been confident that with him\nno such misstep was possible. He could not believe; a little while, and\nluck would turn, and up he would go again--higher than before. Many a\nlawyer--to look no farther than his own profession--had through\nrecklessness or pride or inadvertence got the big men down on him. But\nafter a time they had relented or had found an exact use for him; and\nfall had been succeeded by rise. Was there a single instance where a man\nof good brain had been permanently downed? No, not one. Stay--Some of\nthese unfortunates had failed to reappear on the heights of success.\nYes, thinking of the matter, he recalled several such. Had he been\naltogether right in assuming, in his days of confidence and success,\nthat they stayed down because they belonged down? Perhaps he had judged\nthem harshly? Yes, he was sure he had judged them harshly. There was\nsuch a thing as breaking a proud spirit--and he found within himself\napparent proof that precisely this calamity had befallen him.\n\nThere came a time--and it came soon--when he had about exhausted his\ndesperate ingenuity at cornering acquaintances and former friends and\n\"sticking them up\" for loans of five hundred, a hundred, fifty,\ntwenty-five--Because these vulgar and repulsive facts are not found in\nthe usual records of the men who have dropped and come up again, do not\nimagine that only the hopeless and never-reappearing failures pass\nthrough such experiences. On the contrary, they are part of the common\nhuman lot, and few indeed are the men who have not had them--and\nworse--if they could but be brought to tell the truth. Destiny rarely\npermits any one of us to go from cradle to grave without doing many a\nthing shameful and universally condemned. How could it be otherwise\nunder our social system? When Norman was about at the end of all his\nresources Tetlow called on him--Tetlow, now a partner in the Lockyer\nfirm.\n\nHe came with an air of stealth. \"I don't want anyone to know I'm doing\nthis,\" said he frankly. \"If it got out, I'd be damaged and you'd not\nprofit.\"\n\nRarely does anyone, however unworthy--and Fred Norman was far from\nunworthy, as we humans go--rarely does anyone find himself absolutely\nwithout a friend. There is a saying that no man ever sunk so low, ever\nbecame so vile and squalid in soul and body, but that if he were dying,\nand the fact were noised throughout the world, some woman somewhere\nwould come--perhaps from a sense of duty, perhaps from love, perhaps for\nthe sake of a moment of happiness long past but never equaled, and so\nnever forgotten--but from whatever motive, she would come. In the same\nmanner, anyone in dire straits can be sure of some friend. There were\nseveral others whom Norman had been expecting--men he had saved by his\nlegal ingenuity at turning points in their careers. None of these was so\nimprudent as uselessly to involve himself. It was Tetlow who\ncame--Tetlow, with whom his accounts were more than balanced, with the\nbalance against him. Tetlow, whom he did not expect.\n\nNorman did not welcome him effusively. He said at once: \"How is--she?\"\n\nTetlow shifted uneasily. \"I don't know. She's not with us. I gave her a\nplace there--to get her away from Culver. But she didn't stay long. No\ndoubt she's doing well.\"\n\n\"I thought you cared about her,\" said Norman, who in estimating Tetlow's\npassion had measured it by his own, had neglected to consider that the\ndesires of most men soon grow short of breath and weary of leg.\n\n\"Yes--so I did care for her,\" said Tetlow, in the voice of a man who has\nbeen ill but is now well. \"But that's all over. Women aren't worth\nbothering about much. They're largely vanity. The way they soon take a\nman for granted if he's at all kind to them discourages any but the\npoorest sort of fool. At least that's my opinion.\"\n\n\"Then you don't come from her?\" said Norman with complete loss of\ninterest in his caller.\n\n\"No. I've come--Fred, I hear you're in difficulties.\"\n\nNorman's now deep-set eyes gleamed humorously in his haggard and\nfailed-looking face. \"_In_ difficulties? Not at all. I'm _under_\nthem--drowned forty fathoms deep.\"\n\n\"Then you'll not resent my coming straight to the point and asking if I\ncan help you?\"\n\n\"That's a rash offer, Tetlow. I never suspected rashness was one of your\nqualities.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to offer you a loan or anything of that sort,\" pursued\nTetlow. \"There's only one thing that can help a man in your position. He\nmust either be saved outright or left to drown. I've come with something\nthat may save you.\"\n\nThere was so much of the incongruous in a situation where _he_ was\nlistening to an offer of salvation from such a man as Billy Tetlow that\nNorman smiled.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" he said.\n\n\"There's a chance that within six months or so--perhaps\nsooner--Burroughs and Galloway may end their truce and declare war on\neach other. If so, Galloway will win. Anyhow, the Galloway connection\nwould be better than the Burroughs connection.\"\n\nNorman looked at Tetlow shrewdly. \"How do you know this?\" he asked.\n\nTetlow's eyes shifted. \"Can't tell you. But I know.\"\n\n\"Galloway hates me.\"\n\nTetlow nodded. \"You were the one who forced him into a position where he\nhad to make peace with Burroughs. But Galloway's a big man, big enough\nto admire ability wherever he sees it. He has admired you ever since.\"\n\n\"And has given his business to another firm.\"\n\n\"But if the break comes he'll need you. And he's the sort of man who\ndoesn't hesitate to take what he needs.\"\n\n\"Too remote,\" said Norman, and his despondent gesture showed how quickly\nhope had lighted up. \"Besides, Billy, I've lost my nerve. I'm no good.\"\n\n\"But you've gotten over that--that attack of insanity.\"\n\nNorman shook his head.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" ejaculated Tetlow.\n\n\"Of course you can't,\" said Norman. \"But--there it is.\"\n\n\"You haven't seen her lately?\"\n\n\"Not since that day ... Billy, she hasn't--\" Norman stopped, and\nTetlow saw that his hands were trembling with agitation, and marveled.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Tetlow. \"So far as I know, she's still respectable.\nBut--why don't you go to see her? I think you'd be cured.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" demanded Norman, the veins in his forehead\nbulging with the fury he was ready to release.\n\n\"For no especial reason--on my honor, Fred,\" replied Tetlow. \"Simply\nbecause time works wonders in all sorts of ways, including infatuations.\nAlso--well, the fact is, it didn't seem to me that young lady improved\non acquaintance. Maybe I got tired, or piqued--I don't know. If she\nhadn't been a silly little fool, would she have refused you? I know it\nsounds well--in a novel or a play--for a poor girl to refuse a good\noffer, just from sentiment. But, all the same, only a fool girl does\nit--in life--eh? But go to see her. You'll understand what I mean, I\nthink. I want you to brace up. That may help.\"\n\n\"What's she doing?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'll send you her address. I can get it. About\nGalloway--If that break comes, I propose that we get his business--you\nand I. I want you for a partner. I always did. I think I know how to get\nwork out of you. I understand you better, than anyone else. That's why\nI'm here.\"\n\n\"It's useless,\" said Norman.\n\n\"I'm willing to take the risk. Now, here's what I propose. I'll stake\nyou to the extent of a thousand dollars a month for the next six months,\nyou to keep on as you are and not to tie yourself up to any other\nlawyer, or to any client likely to hamper us if we get the Galloway\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"I've been borrowing right and left----\"\n\n\"I know about that,\" interrupted Tetlow. \"I'm not interested. If you'll\nagree to my proposal, I'll take my chances.\"\n\n\"You are throwing away six thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"I owe you a position where I make five times that much.\"\n\nNorman shrugged his shoulders. \"Very well. Can I have five hundred at\nonce?\"\n\n\"I'll send you a check to-day. I'll send two checks a month--the first\nand the fifteenth.\"\n\n\"I am drinking a great deal.\"\n\n\"You always did.\"\n\n\"Not until recently. I never knew what drinking meant until these last\nfew months.\"\n\n\"Well, do as you like with the money. Drink it all, if you please. I'm\nmaking no conditions beyond the two I stated.\"\n\n\"You will send me that address?\"\n\n\"In the letter with the check.\"\n\n\"Will she see me, do you think?\"\n\n\"I haven't an idea,\" replied Tetlow.\n\n\"What's the mystery?\" asked Norman. \"Why do you speak of her so\nindifferently?\"\n\n\"It's the way I feel.\" Then, in answer to the unspoken suspicion once\nmore appearing in Norman's eyes, he added: \"She's a very nice, sweet\ngirl, Norman--so far as I know or believe. Beyond that--Go to see\nher.\"\n\nIt had been many a week since Norman had heard a friendly voice. The\nvery sound of the human voice had become hateful to him, because he was\nconstantly detecting the note of nervousness, the scarcely concealed\nfear of being entangled in his misfortunes. As Tetlow rose to go, Norman\ntried to detain him. The sound of an unconstrained voice, the sight of a\nbelieving face that did not express one or more of the shadings of\ncontempt between pity and aversion--the sight and sound of this friend\nTetlow was acting upon him like one of those secret, unexpected,\npowerful tonics which nature at times suddenly injects into a dying man\nto confound the doctors and cheat death.\n\n\"Tetlow,\" said he, \"I'm down--probably down for good. But if I ever get\nup again, I'll not make one mistake--the one that cost me this fall. Do\nyou know what that mistake was?\"\n\n\"I suppose you mean Miss Hallowell?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Norman, to his surprise. \"I mean my lack of money, of\ncapital, of a large and secure income. I used to imagine that brains\nwere the best, the only sure asset. I was guilty of the stupidity of\novervaluing my own possessions.\"\n\n\"Brains are a mighty good asset, Fred.\"\n\n\"Yes--and necessary. But a man of action must have under his brains\nanother asset--_must_ have it, Billy. The one secure asset is a big\ncapital. Money rules this world. Some men have been lucky enough to rise\nand stay risen, without money. But not a man of all the men who have\nbeen knocked out could have been dislodged if he had been armed and\narmored with money. My prodigality was my fatal mistake. I shan't make\nit again--if I get the chance. You don't know, Tetlow, how hard it is to\nget money when you are tumbling and must have it. I never dreamed what a\nfactor it is in calamities of _every_ sort. It's _the_ factor.\"\n\n\"I don't like to hear you talk that way, Norman,\" said Tetlow earnestly.\n\"I've always most admired in you the fact that you weren't mercenary.\"\n\n\"And I never shall be,\" said Norman, with the patient smile of a swift,\nkeen mind at one that is slow and hard to make understand. \"It isn't my\nnature. But, if I'm resurrected, I'll seem to be mercenary until I get a\nfull suit of the only armor that's invulnerable in this world. Why, I\nbuilt my fort like a fool. It was impregnable except for one thing--one\nobvious thing. It hadn't a supply of water. If I build again it'll be\nround a spring--an income big enough for my needs and beyond anybody's\npower to cut off.\"\n\nTetlow showed that he was much cheered by Norman's revived interest in\nlife. But he went away uneasy; for the last thing Norman said to him\nwas:\n\n\"Don't forget that address!\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nBut it chanced that Norman met her in the street about an hour after\nTetlow's call.\n\nHe was on the way to lunch at the Lawyer's Club--one of those apparent\nluxuries that are the dire and pitiful necessities of men in New York\nfighting to maintain the semblance and the reputation of prosperity. It\nmust not be imagined by those who are here let into Norman's inmost\nsecrets that his appearance betrayed the depth to which he had fallen.\nAt least to the casual eye he seemed the same rich and powerful\npersonage. An expert might have got at a good part of the truth from his\nsomber eyes and haggard face, from the subtle transformation of the\nformer look of serene pride into the bravado of pretense. And as, in a\ngeneral way, the facts of his fall were known far and wide, all his\nacquaintances understood that his seeming of undiminished success was\nsimply the familiar \"bluff.\" Its advantage to him with them lay in its\nraising a doubt as to just what degree of disaster it hid--no small\nadvantage. Nor was this \"bluff\" altogether for the benefit of the\noutside world. It made his fall less hideously intolerable to himself.\nIn the bottom of his heart he knew that when drink and no money should\nfinally force him to release his relaxing hold upon his fashionable\nclubs, upon luxurious attire and habits, he would suddenly and with\naccelerated speed drop into the abyss--We have all caught glimpses of\nthat abyss--frayed fine linen cheaply laundered, a tie of one time\nsmartness showing signs of too long wear, a suit from the best kind of\ntailor with shiny spot glistening here, patch peeping there, a queer\nunkemptness about the hair and skin--these the beginnings of a road that\nleads straight and short to the barrel-house, the park bench, and the\npolice station. Because, when a man strikes into that stretch of the\nroad to perdition, he ceases to be one of our friends, passes from view\nentirely, we have the habit of _saying_ that such things rarely if ever\nhappen. But we _know_ better. Many's the man now high who has had the sort\nof drop Norman was taking. We remember when he was making a bluff such\nas Norman was making in those days; but we think now that we were\nmistaken in having suspected it of being bluff.\n\nNorman, dressed with more than ordinary care--how sensitive a man\nbecomes about those things when there is neither rustle nor jingle in\nhis pockets, and his smallest check would be returned with the big black\nstamp \"No Funds\"--Norman, groomed to the last button, was in Broadway\nnear Rector Street. Ahead of him he saw the figure of a girl--a trim,\nattractive figure, slim and charmingly long of line. A second glance,\nand he recognized her. What was the change that had prevented his\nrecognizing her at once? He had not seen that particular lightish-blue\ndress before--nor the coquettish harmonizing hat. But that was not the\nreason. No, it was the coquetry in her toilet--the effort of the girl\nto draw attention to her charms by such small devices as are within the\nreach of extremely modest means. He did not like this change. It\noffended his taste; it alarmed his jealousy.\n\nHe quickened his step, and when almost at her side spoke her name--\"Miss\nHallowell.\"\n\nShe stopped, turned. As soon as she recognized him there came into her\nquiet, lovely face a delightful smile. He could not conceal his\namazement. She was glad to see him! Instantly, following the invariable\nhabit of an experienced analytical mind, he wondered for what\nunflattering reason this young woman who did not like him was no longer\nshowing it, was seeming more than a little pleased to see him. \"Why, how\nd'ye do, Mr. Norman?\" said she. And her friendliness and assurance of\nmanner jarred upon him. There was not a suggestion of forwardness; but\nhe, used to her old-time extreme reserve, felt precisely as if she were\nbold and gaudy, after the fashion of so many of the working girls who\nwere popular with the men.\n\nThis unfavorable impression disappeared--or, rather, retired to the\nbackground--even as it became definite. And once more he was seeing the\ncharms of physical loveliness, of physical--and moral, and\nmental--mystery that had a weird power over him. As they shook hands, a\nquiver shot through him as at the shock of a terrific stimulant; and he\nstood there longing to take her in his arms, to feel the delicate yet\nperfect and vividly vital life of that fascinating form--longing to kiss\nthat sensitive, slightly pouted rosy mouth, to try to make those clear\neyes grow soft and dreamy----\n\nShe was saying: \"I've been wondering what had become of you.\"\n\n\"I saw Tetlow,\" he said. \"He promised to send me your address.\"\n\nAt Tetlow's name she frowned slightly; then a gleam of ridicule flitted\ninto her eyes. \"Oh, that silly, squeamish old maid! How sick I got of\nhim!\"\n\nNorman winced, and his jealousy stirred. \"Why?\" he asked.\n\n\"Always warning me against everybody. Always giving me advice. It was\ntoo tiresome. And at last he began to criticize me--the way I\ndressed--the way I talked--said I was getting too free in my manner. The\nimpudence of him!\"\n\nNorman tried to smile.\n\n\"He'd have liked me to stay a silly little mouse forever.\"\n\n\"So you've been--blossoming out?\" said Norman.\n\n\"In a quiet way,\" replied she, with a smile of self-content, so lovely\nas a smile that no one would have minded its frank egotism. \"There isn't\nmuch chance for fun--unless a girl goes too far. But at the same time I\ndon't intend life to be Sunday when it isn't work. I got very cross with\nhim--Mr. Tetlow, I mean. And I took another position. It didn't pay\nquite so well--only fifteen a week. But I couldn't stand being\nwatched--and guyed by all the other girls and boys for it.\"\n\n\"Where are you working?\"\n\n\"With an old lawyer named Branscombe. It's awful slow, as I'm the only\none, and he's old and does everything in an old-fashioned way. But the\nhours are easy, and I don't have to get down till nine--which is nice\nwhen you've been out at a dance the night before.\"\n\nNorman kept his eyes down to hide from her the legion of devils of\njealousy. \"You _have_ changed,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm growing up,\" replied she with a charming toss of her small\nhead--what beautiful effects the sunlight made in among those wavy\nstrands and strays!\n\n\"And you're as lovely as ever--lovelier,\" he said--and his eyes were\nthe eyes of the slave she had spurned.\n\nShe did not spurn him now--and it inflamed his jealousy that she did\nnot. She said: \"Oh, what's the good of looks? The town's full of pretty\ngirls. And so many of them have money--which I haven't. To make a hit in\nNew York a girl's got to have both looks and dress. But I must be going.\nI've an engagement to lunch--\" She gave a proud little smile--\"at the\nAstor House. It's nice upstairs there.\"\n\n\"With Bob Culver?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I haven't seen him since I left his office. You know, Mr.\nTetlow took me with him--back to your old firm. I didn't like Mr.\nCulver. I don't care for those black men. They are bad-tempered and\ntwo-faced. Anyhow, I'd not have anything to do with a man who wanted to\nslip round with me as if he were ashamed of me.\"\n\nShe was looking at Norman pleasantly enough. He wasn't sure that the hit\nwas for him as well as for Culver, but he flushed deeply. \"Will you\nlunch with me at the Astor House at one to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I've got an engagement,\" said she. \"And I must be going. I'm awfully\nlate.\" He had an instinct that her engagement on both days was with the\nsame man. \"I'm glad to have seen you----\"\n\n\"Won't you let me call on you?\" he said imploringly, but with the\nsuggestion that he had no hope of being permitted to come.\n\n\"Certainly,\" responded she with friendly promptness. She opened the\nshopping bag swinging on her arm. \"Here is one of my cards.\"\n\n\"When? This evening?\"\n\nHer laugh showed the beautiful deep pink and dazzling white behind her\nlips. \"No--I'm going to a party.\"\n\n\"Let me take you.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"You wouldn't like it. Only young people.\"\n\n\"But I'm not so old.\"\n\nShe looked at him critically. \"No--you're not. It always puzzled me. You\naren't old--you look like a boy lots of the time. But you always _seem_\nold to me.\"\n\n\"I'll try to do better. To-night?\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" laughed she. \"Let's see--to-morrow's Sunday. Come\nto-morrow--about half past two.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said so gratefully that he cursed himself for his folly\nas he heard his voice--the idiotic folly of so plainly betraying his\nfeelings. No wonder she despised him! Beginning again--and beginning;\nwrong.\n\n\"Good-by.\" Her eyes, her smile flashed and he was alone, watching her\nslender grace glide through the throngs of lower Broadway.\n\nAt his office again at three, he found a note from Tetlow inclosing\nanother of Dorothy's cards and also the promised check. Into his face\ncame the look that always comes into the faces of the prisoners of\ndespair when the bolts slide back and the heavy door swings and hope\nstands on the threshold instead of the familiar grim figure of the\njailer. \"This looks like the turn of the road,\" he muttered. Yes, a turn\nit certainly was--but was it _the_ turn? \"I'll know more as to that,\" said\nhe with a glance at the clock, \"about this time to-morrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a boarding house on the west side. And when the slovenly, smelly\nmaid said, \"Go right up to her room,\" he knew it was--probably\nrespectable, but not rigidly respectable. However, working girls must\nreceive, and they cannot afford parlors and chaperons. Still--It was no\nplace for a lovely young girl, full of charm and of love of life--and\nnot brought up in the class where the women are trained from babyhood to\nprotect themselves.\n\nHe ascended two flights, knocked at the door to the rear. \"Come!\" called\na voice, and he entered. It was a small neat room, arranged comfortably\nand with some taste. He recognized at first glance many little things\nfrom her room in the Jersey City house--things he had provided for her.\nOn the chimney piece was a large photograph of her father--Norman's eyes\nhastily shifted from that. The bed was folded away into a couch--for\nspace and for respectability. At first he did not see her. But when he\nadvanced a step farther, she was disclosed in the doorway of a deep\ncloset that contained a stationary washstand.\n\nHe had never seen her when she was not fully dressed. He was now seeing\nher in a kind of wrapper--of pale blue, clean but not fresh. It was\nopen at the throat; its sleeves fell away from her arms. And, to cap the\nclimax of his agitation, her hair, her wonderful hair, was flowing\nloosely about her face and shoulders.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she cried laughingly. Her eyes sparkled\nand danced; the waves of her hair, each hair standing out as if it were\nalive, sparkled and danced. It was a smile never to be forgotten. \"Why\nare you so embarrassed?\"\n\nHe was embarrassed. He was thrilled. He was enraged--enraged because, if\nshe would thus receive him whom she did not like, she would certainly\nthus receive any man.\n\n\"I don't mind you,\" she went on, mockingly. \"I'd have to be careful if\nit was one of the boys.\"\n\n\"Do you receive the--boys--here?\" demanded he glumly, his voice arrogant\nwith the possessive rights a man feels when he cares for a woman,\nwhether she cares for him or not.\n\n\"Why not?\" scoffed she. \"Where else would I see them? I don't make\nstreet corner dates, thank you. You're as bad as fat, foolish Mr.\nTetlow.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said he humbly.\n\nShe straightway relented, saying: \"Of course I'd not let one of the boys\ncome up when I was dressed like this. But I didn't mind _you_.\" He winced\nat this amiable, unconscious reminder of her always exasperating and\ntantalizing and humiliating indifference to him--\"And as I'm going to a\ngrand dance to-night I simply had to wash my hair. Does that satisfy\nyou, Mr. Primmey?\"\n\nHe hid the torment of his reopened wound and seated himself at the\ncenter table. She returned to a chair in the window where the full force\nof the afternoon sun would concentrate upon her hair. And he gazed spell\nbound. He had always known that her hair was fine. He had never dreamed\nit was like this. It was thick, it was fine and soft. In color, as the\nsunbeams streamed upon it, it was all the shades of gold and all the\nother beautiful shades between brown and red. It fell about her face,\nabout her neck, about her shoulders in a gorgeous veil. And her pure\nwhite skin--It was an even more wonderful white below the line of her\ncollar--where he had never seen it before. Such exquisitely modeled\nears--such a delicate nose--and the curve of her cheeks--and the glory\nof her eyes! He clinched his teeth and his hands, sat dumb with his gaze\ndown.\n\n\"How do you like my room?\" she chattered on. \"It's not so bad--really\nquite comfortable--though I'm afraid I'll be cold when the weather\nchanges. But it's the best I can do. As it is, I don't see how I'm going\nto make ends meet. I pay twelve of my fifteen for this room and two\nmeals. The rest goes for lunch and car fare. As soon as I have to get\nclothes--\" She broke off, laughing.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"what then?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" replied she carelessly. \"Perhaps old Mr.\nBranscombe'll give me a raise. Still, eighteen or twenty is the most I\ncould hope for--and that wouldn't mean enough for clothes.\"\n\nShe shook her head vigorously and her hair stood out yet more vividly\nand the sunbeams seemed to go mad with joy as they danced over and under\nand through it. He had ventured to glance up; again he hastily looked\ndown.\n\n\"You spoiled me,\" she went on. \"Those few months over there in Jersey\nCity. It made _such_ a change in me, though I didn't realize it at the\ntime. You see, I hadn't known since I was a tiny little girl what it was\nto live really decently, and so I was able to get along quite\ncontentedly. I didn't know any better.\" She made a wry face. \"How I\nloathe the canned and cold storage stuff I have to eat nowadays. And how\nI do miss the beautiful room I had in that big house over there! and how\nI miss Molly and Pat--and the garden--and doing as I pleased--and the\nclothes I had: I thought I was being careful and not spoiling myself.\nYou may not believe it, but I was really conscientious about spending\nmoney.\" She laughed in a queer, absent way. \"I had such a funny idea of\nwhat I had a right to do and what I hadn't. And I didn't spend so very\nmuch on out-and-out luxury. But--enough to spoil me for this life.\"\n\nAs Norman listened, as he noted--in her appearance, manner, way of\ntalking--the many meaning signs of the girl hesitating at the fork of\nthe roads--he felt within him the twinges of fear, of jealousy--and\nthrough fear and jealousy, the twinges of conscience. She was telling\nthe truth. He had undermined her ability to live in purity the life to\nwhich her earning power assigned her. . . . _Why_ had she been so friendly\nto him? Why had she received him in this informal, almost if not quite\ninviting fashion?\n\n\"So you think I've changed?\" she was saying. \"Well--I have. Gracious,\nwhat a little fool I was!\"\n\nHis eyes lifted with an agonized question in them.\n\nShe flushed, glanced away, glanced at him again with the old, sweet\nexpression of childlike innocence which had so often made him wonder\nwhether it was merely a mannerism, or was a trick, or was indeed a beam\nfrom a pure soul. \"I'm foolish still--in certain ways,\" she said\nsignificantly.\n\n\"And you always intend to be?\" suggested he with a forced smile.\n\n\"Oh--yes,\" replied she--positively enough, yet it somehow had not the\nfull force of her simple short statements in the former days.\n\nHe believed her. Perhaps because he wished to believe, must believe,\nwould have been driven quite mad by disbelief. Still, he believed. As\nyet she was good. But it would not last much longer. With him--or with\nsome other. If with him, then certainly afterward with another--with\nothers. No matter how jealously he might guard her, she would go that\nroad, if once she entered it. If he would have her for his very own he\nmust strengthen her, not weaken her, must keep her \"foolish still--in\ncertain ways.\"\n\nHe said: \"There's nothing in the other sort of life.\"\n\n\"That's what they say,\" replied she, with ominous irritation.\n\"Still--some girls--_lots_ of girls seem to get on mighty well without\nbeing so terribly particular.\"\n\n\"You ought to see them after a few years.\"\n\n\"I'm only twenty-one,\" laughed she. \"I've got lots of time before I'm\nold. . . . You haven't--married?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"I thought I'd have heard, if you had.\" She laughed queerly--again shook\nout her hair, and it shimmered round her face and over her head and out\nfrom her shoulders like flames. \"You've got a kind of a--Mr. Tetlow way\nof talking. It doesn't remind me of you as you were in Jersey City.\"\n\nShe said nothing, she suggested nothing that had the least impropriety\nin it, or faintest hint of impropriety. It was nothing positive, nothing\naggressive, but a certain vague negative something that gave him the\nimpression of innocence still innocent but looking or trying to look\ntolerantly where it should not. And he felt dizzy and sick, stricken\nwith shame and remorse and jealous fear. Yes--she was sliding slowly,\ngently, unconsciously down to the depth in which he had been lying, sick\nand shuddering--no, to deeper depths--to the depths where there is no\nlight, no trace of a return path. And he had started her down. He had\ndone it when he, in his pride and selfishness, had ignored what the\nsuccess of his project would mean for her. But he knew now; in\nbitterness and shame and degradation he had learned. \"I was infamous!\"\nhe said to himself.\n\nShe began to talk in a low, embarrassed voice:\n\n\"Sometimes I think of getting married. There's a young man--a young\nlawyer--he makes twenty-five a week, but it'll be years and years before\nhe has a good living. A man doesn't get on fast in New York unless he\nhas pull.\"\n\nNorman, roused from his remorse, blazed inside. \"You are in love with\nhim?\"\n\nShe laughed, and he could not tell whether it was to tease him or to\nevade.\n\n\"You'd not care about him long,\" said Norman, \"unless there were more\nmoney coming in than he'd be likely to get soon. Love without money\ndoesn't go--at least, not in New York.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I don't know that?\" said she with the irritation of one\nfaced by a hateful fact. \"Still--I don't see what to do.\"\n\nNorman, biting his lip and fuming and observing her with jealous eyes,\nsaid in the best voice he could command, \"How long have you been in love\nwith him?\"\n\n\"Did I say I was in love?\" mocked she.\n\n\"You didn't say you weren't. Who is he?\"\n\n\"If you'll stay on about half an hour or so, you'll see him. No--you\ncan't. I've got to get dressed before I let him up. He has very strict\nideas--where I'm concerned.\"\n\n\"Then why did you let _me_ come up?\" Norman said, with a penetrating\nglance.\n\nShe lowered her gaze and a faint flush stole into her cheeks. Was it\nconfession of the purpose he suspected? Or, was it merely embarrassment?\n\n\"I heard of a case once,\" continued Norman, his gaze significantly\ndirect, \"the case of a girl who was in love with a poor young fellow.\nShe wanted money--luxury. Also, she wanted the poor young fellow.\"\n\nThe color flamed into the girl's face, then left it pale. Her white\nfingers fluttered with nervous grace into her masses of hair and back to\nher lap again, to rest there in timid quiet.\n\n\"She knew another man,\" pursued Norman, \"one who was able to give her\nwhat she wanted in the way of comfort. So, she decided to make an\narrangement with the man, and keep it hidden from her lover--and in that\nway get along pleasantly until her lover was in better circumstances .\"\n\nHer gaze was upon her hands, listless in her lap. He felt that he had\nspoken her unspoken, probably unformed thoughts. Yes, unformed. Men and\nwomen, especially women, habitually pursued these unacknowledged\nand--even unformed purposes, in their conflicts of the desire to get\nwhat they wanted and their desire to appear well to themselves.\n\n\"What would you think of an arrangement like that?\" asked he, determined\nto draw her secret heart into the open where he could see, where she\ncould see.\n\nShe lifted frank, guileless eyes to his. \"I suppose the girl was trying\nto do the best she could.\"\n\n\"What do you think of a girl who'd do that?\"\n\n\"I don't judge anybody--any more. I've found out that this world isn't\nat all as I thought--as I was taught.\"\n\n\"Would _you_ do it?\"\n\nShe smiled faintly. \"No,\" she replied uncertainly. Then she restored his\nwavering belief in her essential honesty and truthfulness by adding:\n\"That is to say, I don't think I would.\"\n\nShe busied herself with her hair, feeling it to see whether it was not\nyet dry, spreading it out. He looked at her unseeingly. At last she\nsaid: \"You must go. I've got to get dressed.\"\n\n\"Yes--I must be going,\" said he absently, rising and reaching for his\nhat on the center table.\n\nShe stood up, put out her hand. \"I'm glad you came.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he, still in the same abstraction. He shook hands with\nher, moved hesitatingly toward the door. With his hand on the knob he\nturned and glanced keenly at her. He surprised in her face a look of\nmystery--of seriousness, of sadness--was there anxiety in it, also? And\nthen he saw a certain elusive reminder of her father--and it brought to\nhim with curious force the memory of how she had been brought up, of\nwhat must be hers by inheritance and by training--she, the daughter of a\ngreat and simple and noble man----\n\n\"You'll come again?\" she said, and there was the note in her voice that\nmade his nerves grow tense and vibrate.\n\nBut he seemed not to have heard her question. Still at the unopened\ndoor, he folded his arms upon his chest and said, speaking rapidly yet\nwith the deliberation of one who has thought out his words in advance:\n\n\"I don't know what kind of girl you are. I never have known. I've never\nwanted to know. If you told me you were--what is called good, I'd doubt\nit. If you told me you weren't, I'd want to kill you and myself. They\nsay there's a fatal woman for every man and a fatal man for every woman.\nI always laughed at the idea--until you. I don't know what to make of\nmyself.\"\n\nShe suddenly laid her finger on her lips. It irritated him, to discover\nthat, as he talked, speaking the things that came from the very depths\nof his soul, she had been giving him only part of her attention, had\nbeen listening for a step on the stairs. He was hearing the ascending\nstep now. He frowned. \"Can't you send him away?\" he asked.\n\n\"I must,\" said she in a low tone. \"It wouldn't do for him to know you\nwere here. He has strict ideas--and is terribly jealous.\"\n\nA few seconds of silence, then a knock on the other side of the door.\n\n\"Who's there?\" she called.\n\n\"I'm a little early,\" came in an agreeable, young man's voice. \"Aren't\nyou ready?\"\n\n\"Not nearly,\" replied she, in a laughing, innocent voice. \"You'll have\nto go away for half an hour.\"\n\n\"I'll wait out here on the steps.\"\n\nHer eyes were sparkling. A delicate color had mounted to her skin.\nNorman, watching her jealously, clinched his strong jaws. She said:\n\"No--you must go clear away. I don't want to feel that I'm being\nhurried. Don't come back until a quarter past four.\"\n\n\"All right. I'm crazy to see you.\" This in the voice of a lover. She\nsmiled radiantly at Norman, as if she thought he would share in her\nhappiness at these evidences of her being well loved. The unseen young\nman said: \"Exactly a quarter past. What time does your clock say it is\nnow?\"\n\n\"A quarter to,\" replied she.\n\n\"That's what my watch says. So there'll be no mistake. For half an\nhour--good-by!\"\n\n\"Half an hour!\" she called.\n\nShe and Norman stood in silence until the footsteps died away. Then she\nsaid crossly to Norman: \"You ought to have gone before. I don't like to\ndo these things.\"\n\n\"You do them well,\" said he, with a savage gleam.\n\nShe was prompt and sure with his punishment. She said, simply and\nsweetly: \"I'd do anything to keep _his_ good opinion of me.\"\n\nNorman felt and looked cowed. \"You don't know how it makes me suffer to\nsee you fond of another man,\" he cried.\n\nShe seemed not in the least interested, went to the mirror of the bureau\nand began to inspect her hair with a view to doing it up. \"You can go in\nfive minutes,\" said she. \"By that time he'll be well out of the way.\nAnyhow, if he saw you leaving the house he'd not know but what you had\nbeen to see some one else. He knows you by reputation but not by sight.\"\n\nNorman went to her, took her by the shoulders gently but strongly. \"Look\nat me,\" he said.\n\nShe looked at him with an expression, or perhaps absence of expression,\nthat was simple listening.\n\n\"If you meant awhile ago some such thing as I hinted--I will have\nnothing to do with it. You must marry me--or it's nothing at all.\"\n\nHer gaze did not wander, but before his wondering eyes she seemed to\nfade, fade toward colorlessness insignificance. The light died from\nher eyes, the flush of health from her white skin, the freshness from\nher lips, the sparkle and vitality from her hair. A slow, gradual\ntransformation, which he watched with a frightened tightening at the\nheart.\n\nShe said slowly: \"You--want--me--to--_marry_--you?\"\n\n\"I've always wanted it, though I didn't realize,\" replied he. \"How else\ncould I be sure of you? Besides--\" He flushed, added hurriedly, almost\nin an undertone--\"I owe it to you.\"\n\nShe seated herself deliberately.\n\nAfter he had waited in vain for her to speak, he went on: \"If you\nmarried me, I know you'd play square. I could trust you absolutely. I\ndon't know--can't find out much about you--but at least I know that.\"\n\n\"But I don't love you,\" said she.\n\n\"You needn't remind me of it,\" rejoined he curtly.\n\n\"I don't think so--so poorly of you as I used to,\" she went on. \"I\nunderstand a lot of things better than I did. But I don't love you, and\nI feel that I never could.\"\n\n\"I'll risk that,\" said Norman. Through his clinched teeth, \"I've got to\nrisk it.\"\n\n\"I'd be marrying you because I don't feel able to--to make my own way.\"\n\n\"That's the reason most girls have for marrying,\" said he. \"Love comes\nafterward--if it comes. And it's the more likely to come for the girl\nnot having faked the man and herself beforehand.\"\n\nShe glanced at the clock. He frowned. She started up. \"You _must_ go,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"What is your answer?\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't decide so quickly. I must think.\"\n\n\"You mean you must see your young man again--see whether there isn't\nsome way of working it out with him.\"\n\n\"That, too,\" replied she simply. \"But--it's nearly four o'clock----\"\n\n\"I'll come back at seven for my answer.\"\n\n\"No, I'll write you to-night.\"\n\n\"I must know at once. This suspense has got to end. It unfits me for\neverything.\"\n\n\"I'll--I'll decide--to-night,\" she said, with a queer catch in her\nvoice. \"You'll get the letter in the morning mail.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" And he gave her his club address.\n\nShe opened the door in her impatience to be rid of him. He went with a\nhasty \"Good-by\" which she echoed as she closed the door.\n\nWhen he left the house he saw standing on the curb before it a tall,\ngood-looking young man--with a frank amiable face. He hesitated,\nglowering at the young man's profile. Then he went his way, suffocating\nwith jealous anger, depressed, despondent, fit for nothing but to drink\nand to brood in fatuous futility.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nUntil very recently indeed psychology was not an ology at all but an\nindefinite something or other \"up in the air,\" the sport of the winds\nand fogs of transcendental tommy rot. Now, however, science has drawn it\ndown, has fitted it in its proper place as a branch of physiology. And\nwe are beginning to have a clearer understanding of the thoughts and the\nthought-producing actions of ourselves and our fellow beings. Soon it\nwill be no longer possible for the historian and the novelist, the\ndramatist, the poet, the painter or sculptor to present in all\nseriousness as instances of sane human conduct, the aberrations\nresulting from various forms of disease ranging from indigestion in its\nmild, temper-breeding forms to acute homicidal or suicidal mania. In\nthat day of greater enlightenment a large body of now much esteemed art\nwill become ridiculous. Practically all the literature of strenuous\npassion will go by the board or will be relegated to the medical library\nwhere it belongs; and it, and the annals of violence found in the daily\nnewspapers of our remote time will be cited as documentary proof of the\nlow economic and hygienic conditions prevailing in that almost barbarous\nperiod. For certain it is that the human animal when healthy and well\nfed is invariably peaceable and kindly and tolerant--up to the limits of\nselfishness, and even encroaching upon those limits.\n\nOf writing rubbish about love and passion there is no end--and will be\nno end until the venerable traditional nonsense about those interesting\nemotions shares the fate that should overtake all the cobwebs of\nignorance thickly clogging the windows and walls of the human mind. Of\nall the fiddle-faddle concerning passion probably none is more\nshudderingly admired than the notion that one possessed of an\noverwhelming desire for another longs to destroy that other. It is true\nthere is a form of murderous mania that involves practically all the\nemotions, including of course the passions--which are as readily subject\nto derangement as any other part of the human organism. But passion in\nitself--even when it is so powerful that it dominates the whole life, as\nin the case of Frederick Norman--passion in itself is not a form of\nmental derangement in the medical sense. And it does not produce acute\nselfishness, paranoiac egotism, but a generous and beautiful kind of\nunselfishness. Not from the first moment of Fred Norman's possession did\nhe wish to injure or in any way to make unhappy the girl he loved. He\nlonged to be happy with her, to have her happy with and through him. He\nrepresented his plotting to himself as a plan to make her happier than\nshe ever had been; as for ultimate consequences, he refused to consider\nthem. The most hardened rake, when passion possesses him, wishes all\nhappiness to the woman of his pursuit. Indifference, coldness--the\nnatural hard-heartedness of the normal man--returns only when the\ninspiration and elevation of passion disappear in satiety. The man or\nthe woman who continues to inspire passion continues to inspire\ntenderness and considerateness.\n\nSo when Norman left Dorothy that Sunday afternoon, he, being a normal if\nsore beset human being, was soon in the throes of an agonized remorse.\nThere may have been some hypocrisy in it, some struggling to cover up\nthe baser elements in his infatuation for her. What human emotion of\nupward tendency has not at least a little of the varnish of hypocrisy on\ncertain less presentable spots in it? But in the main it was a\ncreditable, a manly remorse, and not altogether the writhings of\njealousy and jealous fear of losing her.\n\nHe saw clearly that she was telling the truth, and telling it too\ngently, when she said he was responsible for her having standards of\nliving which she could not unaided hope to attain. It is a dreadful\nthing to interfere in the destiny of a fellow being. We do it all the\ntime; we do it lightly. Nevertheless, it is a dreadful thing--not one\nthat ought not to be done, but one that ought to be done only under\nimperative compulsion, and then with every precaution. He had interfered\nin Dorothy Hallowell's destiny. He had lifted her out of the dim obscure\nniche where she was ensconced in comparative contentment. He had lifted\nher up where she had seen and felt the pleasures of a life of luxury.\n\n\"But for me,\" he said to himself, \"she would now be marrying this poor\nyoung lawyer, or some chap of the same sort, and would be looking\nforward to a life of happiness in a little flat or suburban cottage.\"\n\nIf she should refuse his offer--what then? Clearly he ought to do his\nbest to help her to happiness with the other man. He smiled cynically at\nthe moral height to which his logic thus pointed the way. Nevertheless,\nhe did not turn away but surveyed it--and there formed in his mind an\nimpulse to make an effort to attempt that height, if Fate should rule\nagainst him with her. \"If I were a really decent man,\" thought he, \"I'd\nsit down now and write her that I would not marry her but would give her\nyoung man a friendly hand in the law if she wished to marry him.\" But he\nknew that such utter generosity was far beyond him. \"Only a hero could\ndo it,\" said he; he added with what a sentimentalist might have called a\nreturn of his normal cynicism, \"only a hero who really in the bottom of\nhis heart didn't especially want the girl.\" And a candid person of\nexperience might possibly admit that there was more truth than cynicism\nin his look askance at the grand army of martyrs of renunciation, most\nof whom have simply given up something they didn't really want.\n\n\"If she accepts me, I'll make it impossible for her not to be happy,\" he\nsaid to himself, in all the fine unselfishness of passion--not divine\nunselfishness but human--not the kind we read about and pretend to\nhave--and get a savage attack of bruised vanity if we are accused of not\nhaving it--no, but just the kind we have and show in our daily\nlives--the unselfishness of longing to make happy those whom it would\nmake us happier to see happy. \"She may think she cares for this young\nclerk--\" so ran his thoughts--\"but she doesn't know her own mind. When\nshe is mine, I'll take her in hand as a gardener does a delicate rare\nflower--and, by Heaven, how I shall make her blossom and bloom!\"\n\nIt would hardly be possible for a human being to pass a stormier night\nthan was that night of his. Alternations between hope and\ndespair--fantastic pictures of future with and without her, wild\npleadings with her--those delirious transports to which our imaginations\ngive way if we happen to be blessed and cursed with imaginations--in the\nsecurity of the darkness and aloneness of night and bed. And through it\nall he was tormented body and soul by her loveliness--her hair, her\nskin, her eyes, the shy, slender graces of her form--He tossed about\nuntil his bed was so wildly disheveled that he had to rise and remake\nit.\n\nWhen day came and the first mail, there was her letter on the salver of\nthe boy entering the room. He reached for it with eager, trembling arm,\ndrew back. \"Put it on the table,\" he said.\n\nThe boy left. He was alone. Leaning upon his elbow in the bed he stared\nat the letter with hollow, terrified eyes. It contained his destiny. If\nshe accepted, he would go up, for his soul sickness would be cured. If\nshe refused, he would cease to struggle. He rose, took from a locked\ndrawer a bottle of rye whisky. He poured a tall glass--the kind called a\nbar glass--half full, drank it straight down without a pause or a\nquiver. The shock brought him up standing. He looked and acted like his\nformer self as he went to the table, took the letter, opened it, and\nread:\n\n  \"I am willing to marry you, if you really want me. I am so tired of\n  struggling, and I don't see anything but dark ahead.--D. H.\"\n\n\nNorman struggled over to the bed, threw himself down, flat upon his\nback, arms and legs extended wide and whole body relaxed. He felt the\nblood whirl up into his brain like the great red and black tongues of\nflame and smoke in a conflagration, and then he slept soundly until\nnearly one o'clock.\n\nTo an outsider there would have been a world of homely commonplace\npathos in that little letter of the girl's if read aright, that is to\nsay, if read with what was between the lines supplied. It is impossible\nto live in cities any length of time and with any sort of eyes without\nlearning the bitter unromantic truths about poverty--city poverty. In\nquiet, desolate places one may be poor, very poor, without much\nconscious suffering. There are no teasing contrasts, no torturing\ntemptations. But in a city, if one knows anything at all of the\npossibilities of civilized life, of the joys and comforts of good food,\nclothing, and shelter, of theater and concert and excursion, of\nentertaining and being entertained, poverty becomes a hell. In the\ncountry, in the quiet towns, the innocent people wonder at the\ngreediness of the more comfortable kinds of city people, at their love\nof money, their incessant dwelling upon it, their reverence for those\nwho have it, their panic-like flight from those who have it not. They\nwonder how folk, apparently human, can be so inhuman. Let them be\ncareful how they judge. If you discover any human being anywhere acting\nas you think a human being should not, investigate all the\ncircumstances, look thoroughly into all the causes of his or her\nconduct, before you condemn him or her as inhuman, unworthy of your\nkinship and your sympathy.\n\nIn her brief letter the girl showed that, young though she was and not\nwidely experienced in life, she yet had seen the horrors of city\npoverty, how it poisons and kills all the fine emotions. She had seen\nmany a loving young couple start out confidently, with a few hundred\ndollars of debt for furniture--had seen the love fade and wither,\nshrivel, die--had seen appear peevishness and hatred and unfaithfulness\nand all the huge, foul weeds that choke the flowers of married life. She\nknew what her lover's salary would buy--and what it would not buy--for\ntwo. She could imagine their fate if there should be three or more. She\nshowed frankly her selfishness of renunciation. But there could be read\nbetween the lines--concealed instead of vaunted--perhaps\nunsuspected--her unselfishness of renunciation for the sake of her lover\nand for the sake of the child or the children that might be. In our love\nof moral sham and glitter, we overlook the real beauties of human\nmorality; we even are so dim or vulgar sighted that we do not see them\nwhen they are shown to us.\n\nAs Norman awakened, he reached for the telephone, said to the boy in\ncharge of the club exchange: \"Look in the book, find the number of a\nlawyer named Branscombe, and connect me with his office.\" After some\nconfusion and delay he got the right office, but Dorothy was out at\nlunch. He left a message that she was to call him up at the club as soon\nas she came in. He was shaving when the bell rang.\n\nHe was at the receiver in a bound. \"Is it you?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" came in her quiet, small voice.\n\n\"Will you resign down there to-day? Will you marry me this afternoon?\"\n\nA brief silence, then--\"Yes.\"\n\nThus it came about that they met at the City Hall license bureau, got\ntheir license, and half an hour later were married at the house of a\nminister in East Thirty-third Street, within a block of the Subway\nstation. He was feverish, gay, looked years younger than his\nthirty-seven. She was quiet, dim, passive, neither grave nor gay, but\ngoing through her part without hesitation, with much the same patient,\nplodding expression she habitually bore as she sat working at her\nmachine--as if she did not quite understand, but was doing her best and\nhoped to get through not so badly.\n\n\"I've had nothing to eat,\" said he as they came out of the parsonage.\n\n\"Nor I,\" said she.\n\n\"We'll go to Delmonico's,\" said he, and hailed a passing taxi.\n\nOn the way, he sitting in one corner explained to her, shrunk into the\nother corner: \"I can confess now that I married you under false\npretenses. I am not prosperous, as I used to be. To be brief and plain,\nI'm down and out, professionally.\"\n\nShe did not move. Apparently she did not change expression. Yet he,\nspeaking half banteringly, felt some frightful catastrophe within her.\n\"You are--poor?\" she said in her usual quiet way.\n\n\"_We_ are poor,\" corrected he. \"I have at present only a thousand dollars\na month--a little more, but not enough to talk about.\"\n\nShe did not move or change expression. Yet he felt that her heart, her\nblood were going on again.\n\n\"Are you--angry?\" he asked.\n\n\"A thousand dollars a month seems an awful lot of money to me,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"It's nothing--nothing to what we'll soon have. Trust me.\" And back into\nhis eyes flashed their former look. \"I've been sick. I'm well again. I\nshall get what I want. If you want anything, you've only to ask for it.\nI'll get it. I know how. . . . I don't prey, myself--I've no fancy for\nthe brutal sports. But I teach lions how to prey, and I make them pay\nfor the lessons.\" He laughed with an effervescing of young vitality and\nself-confidence that made him look handsome and powerful. \"In the future\nthey'll have to pay still higher prices.\"\n\nShe was looking at him with weary, wondering, pathetic eyes that gazed\nfrom the pallor of her dead-white face mysteriously.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" he asked.\n\n\"I was listening,\" replied she.\n\n\"Doesn't it make you happy--what you are going to have?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied she. \"But it makes me content.\"\n\nWith eyes suddenly suffused, he took her hand--so gently. \"Dorothy,\" he\nsaid, \"you will try to love me?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said she. \"You'll be kind to me?\"\n\n\"I couldn't be anything else,\" he cried. And in a gust of passion he\ncaught her to his breast and kissed her triumphantly. \"I love you--and\nyou're mine--mine!\"\n\nShe released herself with the faint insistent push that seemed weak, but\nalways accomplished its purpose. Her lip was trembling. \"You said you'd\nbe kind,\" she murmured.\n\nHe gazed at her with a baffled expression. \"Oh--I understand,\" he said.\n\"And I shall be kind. But I must teach you to love me.\"\n\nHer trembling lip steadied. \"You must be careful or you may teach me to\nhate you,\" said she.\n\nHe studied her in a puzzled way, laughed. \"What a mystery you are!\" he\ncried with raillery. \"Are you child or are you woman? No matter. We\nshall be happy.\"\n\nThe taxicab was swinging to the curb. In the restaurant he ordered an\nenormous meal. And he ate enormously, and drank in due proportion. She\nate and drank a good deal herself--a good deal for her. And the results\nwere soon apparent in a return of the spirits that are normal to\ntwenty-one years, regardless of what may be lurking in the heart, in a\ndark corner, to come forth and torment when there is nothing to distract\nthe attention.\n\n\"We shall have to live quietly for a while,\" said he. \"Of course you\nmust have clothes-at once. I'll take you shopping to-morrow.\" He laughed\ngrimly. \"Just at present we can get only what we pay cash for. Still,\nyou won't need much. Later on I'll take you over to Paris. Does that\nattract you?\"\n\nHer eyes shone. \"How soon?\" she asked.\n\n\"I can tell you in a week or ten days.\" He became abstracted for a\nmoment. \"I can't understand how I let them get me down so easily--that\nis, I can't understand it now. I suppose it's just the difference\nbetween being weak with illness and strong with health.\" His eyes\nconcentrated on her. \"Is it really you?\" he cried gaily. \"And are you\nreally mine? No wonder I feel strong! It was always that way with me. I\nnever could leave a thing until I had conquered it.\"\n\nShe gave him a sweet smile. \"I'm not worth all the trouble you seem to\nhave taken about me,\" said she.\n\nHe laughed; for he knew the intense vanity so pleasantly hidden beneath\nher shy and modest exterior. \"On the contrary,\" said he good-humoredly,\n\"you in your heart think yourself worth any amount of trouble. It's a\nhabit we men have got you women into. And you--One of the many things\nthat fascinate me in you is your supreme self-control. If the king were\nto come down from his throne and fall at your feet, you'd take it as a\nmatter of course.\"\n\nShe gazed away dreamily. And he understood that her indifference to\nmatters of rank and wealth and power was not wholly vanity but was, in\npart at least, due to a feeling that love was the only essential. Nor\ndid he wonder how she was reconciling this belief of high and pure\nsentiment with what she was doing in marrying him. He knew that human\nbeings are not consistent, cannot be so in a universe that compels them\nto face directly opposite conditions often in the same moment. But just\nas all lines are parallel in infinity, so all actions are profoundly\nconsistent when referred to the infinitely broad standard of the\nnecessity that every living thing shall look primarily to its own well\nbeing. Disobedience to this fundamental carries with it inevitable\npunishment of disintegration and death; and those catastrophes are\nserious matters when one has but the single chance at life, that will be\nrepeated never again in all the eternities.\n\nAfter their late lunch or early dinner, they drove to her lodgings. He\nwent up with her and helped her to pack--not a long process, as she had\nfew belongings. He noted that the stockings and underclothes she took\nfrom the bureau drawers were in anything but good condition, that the\nhalf dozen dresses she took from the closet and folded on the couch were\nabout done for. Presently she said, cheerfully and with no trace of\nfalse shame:\n\n\"You see, I'm pretty nearly in rags.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's soon arranged,\" replied he. \"Why bother to take these\nthings? Why not give them to the maid?\"\n\nShe debated with herself. \"I think you're right,\" she decided. \"Yes,\nI'll give them to Jennie.\"\n\n\"The underclothes, too,\" he urged. \"And the hats.\"\n\nIt ended in her having left barely enough loosely to fill the bottom of\na small trunk with two trays.\n\nThey drove to the Knickerbocker Hotel, and he took a small suite, one of\nthe smallest and least luxurious in the house, for with all his desire\nto make her feel the contrast of her change of circumstances sharply, he\ncould not forget how limited his income was, and how unwise it would be\nto have to move in a few days to humbler quarters. He hoped that the\nrooms, englamoured by the hotel's general air of costly luxury, would\nsufficiently impress her. And while she gave no strong indication but\naccepted everything in her wonted quiet, passive manner, he was shrewd\nenough to see that she was content. \"To-morrow,\" he said to himself,\n\"after she has done some shopping, the last regret will leave her, and\nher memory of that clerk will begin to fade fast. I'll give her too much\nelse to think about.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe following morning, when they faced each other at breakfast in their\nsitting room, he glanced at her from time to time in wonder and terror.\nShe looked not merely insignificant, but positively homely. Her skin had\na sickly pallor; her hair seemed to be of many different and\ndisagreeable shades of uninteresting dead yellow. Her eyes suggested\nfaded blue china dishes, with colorless lashes and reddened edges of the\nlids. Her lips had lost their rosy freshness, her teeth their sparkling\nwhiteness.\n\nHis heavy heart seemed to be resting nauseously upon the pit of his\nstomach. Was his infatuation sheer delusion, with no basis of charm in\nher at all? Was she, indeed, nothing but this unattractive, faded little\ncommonplaceness?--a poor specimen of an inferior order of working girl?\nWhat an awakening! And she was his _wife_!--was his companion for the yet\nmore brilliant career he had resolved and was planning! He must\nintroduce her everywhere, must see the not to be concealed amazement in\nthe faces of his acquaintances, must feel the cruel covert laughter and\njeering at his weak folly! Was there ever in history or romance a\nparallel to such fatuity as his? Why, people would be right in thinking\nhim a sham, a mere bluffer at the high and strong qualities he was\nreputed to have.\n\nHad Norman been, in fact, the man of ice and iron the compulsions of a\ncareer under the social system made him seem, the homely girl opposite\nhim that morning would speedily have had something to think about other\nthan her unhappiness of the woman who has given her person to one man\nand her heart to another. Instead, the few words he addressed to her\nwere all gentleness and forbearance. Stronger than his chagrin was his\npity for her--the poor, unconscious victim of his mad hallucination.\nIf she thought about the matter at all, she assumed that he was still\nthe slave of her charms--for, the florid enthusiasm of man's passion\ninevitably deludes the woman into fancying it objective instead of\nwholly subjective; and, only the rare very wise woman, after much\nexperience, learns to be suspicious of the validity of her own charms\nand to concentrate upon keeping up the man's delusions.\n\nAt last he rose and kissed her on the brow and let his hand rest gently\non her shoulder--what a difference between those caresses and the\ncaresses that had made her beg him to be \"kind\" to her! Said he:\n\n\"Do you mind if I leave you alone for a while? I ought to go to the club\nand have the rest of my things packed and sent. I'll not be gone\nlong--about an hour.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said she lifelessly.\n\n\"I'll telephone my office that I'll not be down to-day.\"\n\nWith an effort she said, \"There's no reason for doing that. I don't want\nto interfere with your business.\"\n\n\"I'm neglecting nothing. And that shopping must be done.\"\n\nShe made no reply, but went to the window, and from the height looked\ndown and out upon the mighty spread of the city. He observed her a\nmoment with a dazed pitying expression, took his hat and departed.\n\nIt was nearly two hours before he got together sufficient courage to\nreturn. He had been hoping--had been saying to himself with vigorous\neffort at confidence--that he had simply seen one more of the many\ntransformations, each of which seemed to present her as a wholly\ndifferent personality. When he should see her again, she would have\nwiped out the personality that had shocked and saddened him, would\nappear as some new variety of enchantress, perhaps even more potent over\nhis senses than ever before. But a glance as he entered demolished that\nhope. She was no different than when he left. Evidently she had been\ncrying, and spasms of that sort always accentuate every unloveliness. He\ndid not try to nerve himself to kiss her, but said:\n\n\"It'll not take you long to get ready?\"\n\nShe moved to rise from her languid rest upon the sofa. She sank back.\n\"Perhaps we'd better not go to-day,\" suggested she.\n\n\"Don't you feel well?\" he asked, and his tone was more sympathetic than\nit would have been had his sympathy been genuine.\n\n\"Not very,\" replied she, with a faint deprecating smile. \"And not\nvery--not very----\"\n\n\"Not very what?\" he said, in a tone of encouragement.\n\n\"Not very happy,\" she confessed. \"I'm afraid I've made a--a dreadful\nmistake.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Evidently she had been crying.\"]\n\nHe looked at her in silence. She could have said nothing that would have\ncaused a livelier response within himself. His cynicism noted the fact\nthat while he had mercifully concealed his discontent, she was thinking\nonly of herself. But he did not blame her. It was only the familiar\nhabit of the sex, bred of man's assiduous cultivation of its egotism. He\nsaid: \"Oh, you'll feel differently about it later. Let's get some fresh\nair and see what the shops have to offer.\"\n\nA pause, then she, timidly: \"Would you mind very much if I--if I\ndidn't--go on?\"\n\n\"You mean, if you left me?\"\n\nShe nodded without looking at him. He could not understand himself, but\nas he sat observing her, so young, so inexperienced and so undesirable,\na pity of which he would not have dreamed his nature capable welled up\nin him, choking his throat with sobs he could scarcely restrain and\nfilling his eyes with tears he had secretly to wipe away. And he felt\nhimself seized of a sense of responsibility for her as strong in its\nsolemn, still way as any of the paroxysms of his passion had been.\n\nHe said: \"My dear--you mustn't decide anything so important to you in a\nhurry.\"\n\nA tremor passed over her, and he thought she was going to dissolve in\nhysterics. But she exhibited once more that marvelous and mysterious\nself-control, whose secret had interested and baffled him. She said in\nher dim, quiet way:\n\n\"It seems to me I just can't stay on.\"\n\n\"You can always go, you know. Why not try it a few days?\"\n\nHe could feel the trend of her thoughts, and in the way things often\namuse us without in the least moving us to wish to laugh, he was amused\nby noting that she was trying to bring herself to stay on, out of\nconsideration for _his_ feelings! He said with a kind of paternal\ntenderness:\n\n\"Whenever you want to go, I am willing to arrange things for you--so\nthat you needn't worry about money. But I feel that, as I am older than\nyou, I ought to do all I can to keep you from making a mistake you might\nsoon regret.\"\n\nShe studied him dubiously. He saw that she--naturally enough--did not\nbelieve in his disinterestedness, that she hadn't a suspicion of his\nchange, or, rather collapse, of feeling. She said:\n\n\"If you ask it, I'll stay a while. But you must promise to--to be kind\nto me.\"\n\nThere was only gentleness in his smile. But what a depth of satirical\nself-mockery and amusement at her innocent young egotism it concealed!\n\"You'll never have reason to speak of that again, my dear,\" said he.\n\n\"I--can--trust you?\" she said.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" replied he. \"I'll have another room opened into this\nsuite. Would you like that?\"\n\n\"If you--if you don't mind.\"\n\nHe stood up with sudden boyish buoyance. \"Now--let's go shopping. Let's\namuse ourselves.\"\n\nShe rose with alacrity. She eyed him uncertainly, then flung her arms\nround his neck and kissed him.\n\n\"You are _so_ good to me!\" she cried. \"And I'm not a bit nice.\"\n\nHe did not try to detain her, but sent her to finish dressing, with an\nencouraging pat on the shoulder and a cheerful, \"Don't worry about\nyourself--or me.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nAbout half an hour later the door into the bedroom opened and she\nappeared on the threshold of the sitting room, ready for the street. He\nstared at her in the dazed amazement of a man faced by the impossible,\nand uncertain whether it is sight or reason that is tricking him. She\nhad gone into the bedroom not only homely but commonplace, not only\ncommonplace but common, a dingy washed-out blonde girl whom it would be\na humiliation to present as his wife. She was standing there, in the\nmajesty of such proud pale beauty as poets delight to ascribe to a\nsorrowful princess. Her wonderful skin was clear and translucent, giving\nher an ethereal look. Her hair reminded him again of what marvels he had\nseen in the sunlight of Sunday afternoon. And looking at her form and\nthe small head so gracefully capping it, he could think only of the\nsimile that had always come to him in his moments of ecstasy--the lily\non its tall stem.\n\nAnd once more, like a torrent, the old infatuation sprang from its dried\nsources and came rushing and overwhelming through vein and nerve. \"Am I\nmad now?--was I mad a few moments ago?--is it she or is it my own\ndisordered senses?\"\n\nShe was drawing on her gloves, was unconscious of his confusion. He\ncontrolled himself and said: \"You have a most disconcerting way of\nchanging your appearance.\"\n\nShe glanced down at her costume. \"No, it's the same dress. I've only the\none, you know.\"\n\nHe longed to take her in his arms, but could not trust himself. And this\nwonder-girl, his very own, was talking of leaving him! And he--not an\nhour before--he, apparently in his right senses had been tolerating\nsuch preposterous talk! Give her up? Never! He must see to it that the\nsubject did not find excuse for intruding again. \"I have frightened\nher--have disgusted her. I must restrain myself. I must be patient--and\nteach her slowly--and win her gradually.\"\n\nThey spent an interesting and even exciting afternoon, driving from shop\nto shop and selecting the first beginnings of her wardrobe. He had only\nabout three hundred dollars. Some of the things they ordered were ready\nfor delivery, and so had to be paid for at once. When they returned to\nthe hotel he had but fifty dollars left--and had contracted debts that\nmade it necessary for him to raise at least a thousand dollars within a\nweek. He saw that his freedom with sums of money which terrified her\nfilled her with awe and admiration--and that he was already more\nsuccessful than he had expected to be, in increasing her hesitation\nabout leaving him. Among the things they had bought were a simple black\nchiffon dress and a big plumed black hat to match. These needed no\nalterations and were delivered soon after they returned. Some silk\nstockings came also and a pair of slippers bought for the dinner toilet.\n\n\"You can dress to-night,\" said he, \"and I'll take you to Sherry's, and\nto the theater afterwards.\"\n\nShe was delighted. At last she was going to look like the women of whom\nshe had been dreaming these last few months. She set about dressing\nherself, he waiting in the sitting room in a state of acute nervousness.\nWhat would be the effect of such a toilet? Would she look like a\nlady--or like--what she had suggested that morning? She was so\nchangeable, had such a wide range of variability that he dared not hope.\nWhen she finally appeared, he was ready to fall down and worship. He was\nabout to take her where his world would see her, where every inch of her\nwould be subjected to the cruelest, most hostile criticism. One glance\nat her, and he knew a triumph awaited him. No man and no woman would\nwonder that he had lost his head over such beauty as hers. Hat and dress\nseemed just what had been needed to bring out the full glory of her\ncharms.\n\n\"You are incredibly beautiful,\" he said in an awed tone. \"I am proud of\nyou.\"\n\nA little color came into her cheeks. She looked at herself in the mirror\nwith her quiet intense secret, yet not covert vanity. He laughed in\nboyish pleasure. \"This is only the small beginning,\" said he. \"Wait a\nfew months.\"\n\nAt dinner and in a box at the theater afterwards, he had the most\nexquisite pleasure of his life. She had been seen by many of his former\nfriends, and he was certain they knew who she was. He felt that he would\nhave no difficulty in putting her in the place his wife should occupy. A\nwoman with such beauty as hers was a sensation, one fashionable society\nwould not deny itself. She had good manners, an admirable manner. With a\nlittle coaching she would be as much at home in grandeur as were those\nwho had always had it.\n\nThe last fear of losing her left him. On the way back to the hotel he,\nin a delirium of pride and passion, crushed her in his arms and caressed\nher with the frenzy that had always terrified her. She resisted only\nfaintly, was almost passive. \"She is mine!\" he said to himself,\nexultantly. \"She is really mine!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he awoke in the morning she was still asleep--looked like a tired\nlovely child. Several times, while he was dressing, he went in to feast\nhis eyes upon her beauty. How could he possibly have thought her homely,\nin whatever moment of less beauty or charm she might have had? The\ncrowning charm of infinite variety! She had a delightfully sweet\ndisposition. He was not sure how much or how little intelligence she\nhad--probably more than most women. But what did that matter? It would\nbe impossible ever to grow weary or to be anything but infatuated lover\nwhen she had such changeful beauty.\n\nHe kissed her lightly on her thick braids, as he was about to go. He\nleft a note explaining that he did not wish to disturb her and that it\nwas necessary for him to be at the office earlier. And that morning in\nall New York no man left his home for the day's struggle for dollars\nwith a freer or happier heart, or readier to play the game boldly,\nskillfully, with success.\n\nCertainly he needed all his courage and all his skill.\n\nTo most of the people who live in New York and elsewhere throughout the\ncountry--or the world, for that matter--an income of a thousand dollars\na month seems extremely comfortable, to say the least of it. The average\nAmerican family of five has to scrape along on about half that sum a\nyear. But among the comfortable classes in New York--and perhaps in one\nor two other cities--a thousand dollars a month is literally genteel\npoverty. To people accustomed to what is called luxury nowadays--people\nwith the habit of the private carriage, the private automobile, and\nseveral servants--to such people a thousand dollars a month is an absurd\nlittle sum. It would not pay for the food alone. It would not buy for a\nman and his wife, with no children, clothing enough to enable them to\nmake a decent appearance.\n\nNorman, living alone and living very quietly indeed, might have got\nalong for a while on that sum, if he had taken much thought about\nexpenditures, had persisted in such severe economies as using street\ncars instead of taxicabs and drinking whisky at dinner instead of his\ncustomary quart of six-dollar champagne. Norman, the married man, could\nnot escape disaster for a single month on an income so pitiful.\n\nProbably on the morning on which he set out for downtown in search of\nmoney enough to enable him to live decently, not less than ten thousand\nmen on Manhattan Island left comfortable or luxurious homes faced with\nprecisely the same problem. And each and every one of them knew that on\nthat day or some day soon they must find the money demanded imperiously\nby their own and their families' tastes and necessities or be\nruined--flung out, trampled upon, derided as failures, hated by the\n\"loved ones\" they had caused to be humiliated. And every man of that\nlegion had a fine, an unusually fine brain--resourceful, incessant,\nteeming with schemes for wresting from those who had dollars the dollars\nthey dared not go home without. And those ten thousand quickest and most\nenergetic brains, by their mode of thought and action, determined the\nthought and action of the entire country--gave the mercenary and\nunscrupulous cast to the whole social system. Themselves the victims of\nconditions, they were the bellwethers to millions of victims compelled\nto follow their leadership.\n\nNorman, by the roundabout mode of communication he and Tetlow had\nestablished, summoned his friend and backer to his office. \"Tetlow,\" he\nbegan straight off, \"I've got to have more money.\"\n\n\"How much?\" said Tetlow.\n\n\"More than you can afford to advance me.\"\n\n\"How much?\" repeated Tetlow.\n\n\"Three thousand a month right away--at the least.\"\n\n\"That's a big sum,\" said Tetlow.\n\n\"Yes, for a man used to dealing in small figures. But in reality it's a\nmoderate income.\"\n\n\"Few large families spend more.\"\n\n\"Few large or small families in my part of New York pinch along on so\nlittle.\"\n\n\"What has happened to you?\" said Tetlow, dropping into a chair and\nfolding his fat hands on his stomach.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"It's in your voice--in your face--in your cool demand for a big\nincome.\"\n\n\"Let's start right, old man,\" said Norman. \"Don't _call_ thirty-six\nthousand a year big or you'll _think_ it big. And if you think it big, you\nwill stay little.\"\n\nTetlow nodded. \"I'm ready to grow,\" said he. \"Now what's happened to\nyou?\"\n\n\"I've got married,\" replied Norman.\n\n\"I thought so. To Miss--Hallowell?\"\n\n\"To Miss Hallowell. So my way's clear, and I'm going to resume the\nmarch.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I've two plans. Either will serve. The first is yours--the one you\npartly revealed to me the other day.\"\n\n\"Partly?\" said Tetlow.\n\n\"Partly,\" repeated Norman, laughing. \"I know you, Billy, and that means\nI know you're absolutely incapable of plotting as big a scheme as you\nsuggested to me. It came either from Galloway or from some one of his\nclique.\"\n\n\"I said all I'm at liberty to say, Fred.\"\n\n\"I don't wish you to break your promise. All I want to know is, can I\nget the three thousand a month and assurance of its lasting and leading\nto something bigger?\"\n\n\"What is your other scheme?\" said Tetlow, and it was plain to the\nshrewder young lawyer that the less shrewd young lawyer wished to gain\ntime.\n\n\"Simple and sure,\" replied Norman. \"We will buy ten shares of Universal\nFuel Company through a dummy and bring suit to dissolve it. I looked\ninto the matter for Burroughs once when he was after the Fosdick-Langdon\ngroup. Universal Fuel wouldn't dare defend the action I could bring. We\ncould get what we pleased for our ten shares to let up on the suit. The\nmoment their lawyers saw the papers I'd draw, they'd advise it.\"\n\nTetlow shook his large, impressively molded head. \"Shady,\" said he.\n\"Shady.\"\n\nNorman smiled with good-natured patience. \"You sound like Burroughs or\nGalloway when they are denouncing a man for trying to get rich by the\nsame methods they pursued. My dear Bill, don't be one of those lawyers\nwho will do the queer work for a client but not for themselves. There's\nno sense, no morality, no intelligent hypocrisy even, in that. We didn't\ncreate the commercial morality of the present day. For God's sake, let's\nnot be of the poor fools who practice it but get none of its benefits.\"\n\nTetlow shifted uneasily. \"I don't like to hear that sort of thing,\" said\nhe, apologetic and nervous.\n\n\"Is it true?\"\n\n\"Yes. But--damn it, I don't like to hear it.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you're willing to pay the price of remaining small and\nobscure just for the pleasure of indulging in a wretched hypocrisy of a\nself-deception. Bill, come out of the small class. Whether you go in\nwith me or not, come out of the class of understrappers. What's the\ndifference between the big men and their little followers? Why, the big\nmen _see_. They don't deceive themselves with the cant they pour out for\nthe benefit of the ignorant mob.\"\n\nTetlow was listening like a pupil to a teacher. That was always his\nattitude toward Norman.\n\n\"The big men,\" continued Norman, \"know that canting is necessary--that\none must always profess high and disinterested motives, and so on, and\nso on. But they don't let their hypocritical talk influence their\nactions. How is it with the little fellows? Why, they believe the\nflapdoodle the leaders talk. They go into the enterprise, do all the\nsmall dirty work, lie and cheat and steal, and hand over the proceeds to\nthe big fellows, for the sake of a pat on the back and a noisy 'Honest\nfellow! Here are a few crumbs for you.' And crumbs are all that a weak,\nsilly, hypocritical fool deserves. Can you deny it?\"\n\n\"No doubt you're right, Fred,\" conceded Tetlow. \"But I'm afraid I\nhaven't the nerve.\"\n\n\"Come in behind me. I've got nerve for two--_now_!\"\n\nAt that triumphant \"now\" Tetlow looked curiously at his friend. \"Yes, _it_\nhas changed you--changed you back to what you were. I don't understand.\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary that you understand,\" rejoined Norman.\"\n\n\"Do you think you could really carry through that scheme you've just\noutlined?\"\n\n\"I see it fascinates you.\"\n\n\"I've no objection to rising to the class of big men,\" said Tetlow. \"But\naren't you letting your confidence in yourself deceive you?\"\n\n\"Did I ever let it deceive me?\"\n\n\"No,\" confessed Tetlow. \"I've often watched you, and thought you'd fall\nthrough it, or stumble at least. But you never did.\"\n\n\"And shall I tell you why? Because I use my self-confidence and my\nhopefulness and all my optimistic qualities only to create an atmosphere\nof success. But when it comes to planning a move of any kind, when I\nassemble my lieutenants round the council board in my brain, I never\npermit a single cheerful one to speak, or even to enter. It's a serious,\ngloomy circle of faces, Bill.\"\n\nTetlow nodded reminiscently. \"Yes, you always were like that, Fred.\"\n\n\"And the one who does the most talking at my council is the gloomiest of\nall. He's Lieutenant Flawpicker. He can't see any hope for anything.\nHe sees all the possibilities of failure. He sees all the chances\nagainst success. And what's the result? Why, when the council rises it\nhas taken out of the plan every chance of mishap that my intelligence\ncould foresee and it has provided not one but several safe lines of\norderly retreat in case success proves impossible.\"\n\nTetlow gazed at Norman in worshipful admiration. \"What a brain! What\na mind!\" he ejaculated. \"And to think that _you_ could be upset by a\n_woman_!\"\n\nNorman leaned back in his chair smiling broadly. \"Not by a woman,\" he\ncorrected. \"By a girl--an inexperienced girl of twenty.\"\n\n\"It seems incredible.\"\n\n\"A grain of dust, dropped into a watch movement in just the right\nplace--you know what happens.\"\n\nTetlow nodded. Then, with a sharp, anxious look, \"But it's all over?\"\n\nNorman hesitated. \"I believe so,\" he said.\n\nTetlow rose and rubbed his thighs. He had been sitting long in the same\nposition, and he was now stout enough to suffer from fat man's cramp.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"we needn't bother about that Universal Fuel scheme at\npresent. I can guarantee you the three thousand dollars, and the other\nthings.\"\n\nNorman shook his head. \"Not enough,\" he said.\n\n\"You want more money?\"\n\n\"No. But I will not work, or rather, wait, in the dark. Tell your\nprincipals that I must be let in.\"\n\nTetlow hesitated, walking about the office. Finally he said, \"Look here,\nFred--you think I deceived you the other day--posed as your friend when\nin reality I was simply acting as agent for people who wanted you.\"\n\nNorman gave Tetlow a look that made him redden with pleasure. \"No, I\ndon't, old man,\" said he. \"I know you recommended me--and that they were\nshy of me because of the way I've been acting--and that you stood\nsponsor for me. Isn't that right?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" admitted Tetlow. \"But they were eager to get you.\nIt was only a question of trusting you. I was able to do you a good turn\nthere.\"\n\n\"And I'll make a rich man, and a famous one, of you,\" said Norman.\n\n\"Yes. I believe you will,\" cried Tetlow, tears in his prominent studious\neyes. \"I'll see those people in a day or two, and let you know. Do you\nneed money right away? Of course you do.\" And down he sat and drew a\ncheck for fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nNorman laughed as he glanced to see if it was correctly drawn. \"I'd not\nhave dared return to my bride with empty pockets. That's what it means\nto live in New York.\"\n\nTetlow grinned. \"A sentimental town, isn't it? Especially the women.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't blame them,\" said Norman. \"They need the money, and the\nonly way they've got of making it is out of sentiment. And you must\nadmit they give a bully good quality, if the payment is all right.\"\n\nTetlow shrugged his shoulders. \"I'm glad I don't need them,\" said he.\n\"It gives me the creeps to see them gliding about with their beautiful\ndresses and their sweet, soft faces.\"\n\nHe and Norman lunched together in an out-of-the way restaurant. After a\nbusy and a happy afternoon, Norman returned early to the hotel. He had\ncashed his check. He was in funds. He would give her another and more\nthrilling taste of the joy that was to be hers through him--and soon she\nwould be giving even as she got--for he would teach her not to fear\nlove, not to shrink from it, but to rejoice in it and to let it permeate\nand complete all her charms.\n\nHe ascended to the apartment and knocked. There was no answer. He\nsearched in vain for a chambermaid to let him in. He descended to the\noffice. \"Oh, Mr. Norman,\" said one of the clerks. \"Your wife left this\nnote for you.\"\n\nNorman took it. \"She went out?\"\n\n\"About three o'clock--with a young gentleman who called on her. They\ncame back a while ago and she left the note.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Norman. He took his key, went up to the apartment. Not\nuntil he had closed and locked the door did he open the note. He read:\n\n  \"Last night you broke your promise. So I am going away. Don't look for\n  me. It won't be any use. When I decide what to do I'll send you word.\"\n\n\nHe was standing at the table. He tossed the note on the marble, threw\nopen the bedroom door. The black chiffon dress, the big plumed hat, and\nall the other articles they had bought were spread upon the bed,\narranged with the obvious intention that he should see at a glance she\nhad taken nothing away with her.\n\n\"Hell!\" he said aloud. \"Why didn't I let her go yesterday morning?\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nA few days later, Tetlow, having business with Norman, tried to reach\nhim by telephone. After several failures he went to the hotel, and in\nthe bar learned enough to enable him to guess that Norman was of on a\nmad carouse. He had no difficulty in finding the trail or in following\nit; the difficulty lay in catching up, for Norman was going fast. Not\nuntil late at night--that is, early in the morning--of the sixth day\nfrom the beginning of his search did he get his man.\n\nHe was prepared to find a wreck, haggard, wildly nervous and\ndisreputably disheveled; for, so far as he could ascertain Norman had\nnot been to bed, but had gone on and on from one crowd of revelers to\nanother, in a city where it is easy to find companions in dissipation at\nany hour of the twenty-four. Tetlow was even calculating upon having to\nput off their business many weeks while the crazy man was pulling\nthrough delirium tremens or some other form of brain fever.\n\nAn astonishing sight met his eyes in the Third Avenue oyster house\nbefore which the touring car Norman had been using was drawn up. At a\nlong table, eating oysters as fast as the opener could work, sat Norman\nand his friend Gaskill, a fellow member of the Federal Club, and about a\nscore of broken and battered tramps. The supper or breakfast was going\nforward in admirable order. Gaskill, whom Norman had picked up a few\nhours before, showed signs of having done some drinking. But not Norman.\nIt is true his clothing might have looked fresher; but hardly the man\nhimself.\n\n\"Just in time!\" he cried out genially, at sight of Tetlow. \"Sit down\nwith us. Waiter, a chair next to mine. Gentlemen, Mr. Tetlow. Mr.\nTetlow, gentlemen. What'll you have, old man?\"\n\nTetlow declined champagne, accepted half a dozen of the huge oysters.\n\"I've been after you for nearly a week,\" said he to Norman.\n\n\"Pity you weren't _with_ me,\" said Norman. \"I've been getting acquainted\nwith large numbers of my fellow citizens.\"\n\n\"From the Bowery to Yonkers.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Don't fall asleep, Gaskill.\"\n\nBut Gaskill was snoring with his head on the back of his chair and his\nthroat presented as if for the as of the executioner. \"He's all in,\"\nsaid Tetlow.\n\n\"That's the way it goes,\" complained Norman. \"I can't find anyone to\nkeep me company.\"\n\nTetlow laughed. \"You look as if you had just started out,\" said he.\n\"Tell me--_where_ have you slept?\"\n\n\"I haven't had time to sleep as yet.\"\n\n\"I dropped in to suggest that a little sleep wouldn't do any harm.\"\n\n\"Not quite yet. Watch our friends eat. It gives me an appetite. Waiter,\nanother dozen all round--and some more of this carbonated white wine\nyou've labeled champagne.\"\n\nAs he called out this order, a grunt of satisfaction ran round the row\nof human derelicts. Tetlow shuddered, yet was moved and thrilled, too,\nas he glanced from face to face--those hideous hairy countenances,\nbegrimed and beslimed, each countenance expressing in its own repulsive\nway the one emotion of gratified longing for food and drink. \"Where did\nyou get 'em?\" inquired he.\n\n\"From the benches in Madison Square,\" replied Norman. He laughed\nqueerly. \"Recognize yourself in any of those mugs, Tetlow?\" he asked.\n\nTetlow shivered. \"I should say not!\" he exclaimed.\n\nNorman's eyes gleamed. \"I see myself in all of 'em,\" said he.\n\n\"Poor wretches!\" muttered Tetlow.\n\n\"Pity wasted,\" he rejoined. \"You might feel sorry for a man on the way\nto where they've got. But once arrived--as well pity a dead man sleeping\nquietly in his box with three feet of solid earth between him and\nworries of every kind.\"\n\n\"Shake this crowd,\" said Tetlow impatiently. \"I want to talk with you.\"\n\n\"All right, if it bores you.\" He sent the waiter out for enough\nlodging-house tickets to provide for all. He distributed them himself,\nto make sure that the proprietor of the restaurant did not attempt to\ngraft. Then he roused Gaskill and bundled him into the car and sent it\naway to his address. The tramps gathered round and gave Norman three\ncheers--they pressed close while four of them tried to pick his and\nTetlow's pockets. Norman knocked them away good-naturedly, and he and\nTetlow climbed into Tetlow's hansom.\n\n\"To my place,\" suggested Tetlow.\n\n\"No, to mine--the Knickerbocker,\" replied Norman.\n\n\"I'd rather you went to my place first,\" said Tetlow uneasily.\n\n\"My wife isn't with me. She has left me,\" said Norman calmly.\n\nTetlow hesitated, extremely nervous, finally acquiesced. They drove a\nwhile in silence, then Norman said, \"What's the business?\"\n\n\"Galloway wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Tell him to come to my office to-morrow--that means to-day--at any time\nafter eleven.\"\n\n\"But that gives you no chance to pull yourself together,\" objected\nTetlow.\n\nNorman's face, seen in the light of the street lamp they happened to be\npassing, showed ironic amusement. \"Never mind about me, Billy. Tell him\nto come.\"\n\nTetlow cleared his throat nervously. \"Don't you think, old man, that\nyou'd better go to see him? I'll arrange the appointment.\"\n\nNorman said quietly: \"Tetlow, I've dropped pretty far. But not so far\nthat I go to my clients. The rule of calls is that the man seeking the\nfavor goes to the man who can grant it.\"\n\n\"But it isn't the custom nowadays for a lawyer to deal that way with a\nman like Galloway.\"\n\n\"And neither is it the custom for anyone to have any self-respect. Does\nGalloway need my brains more than I need his money, or do I need his\nmoney more than he needs my brains? You know what the answer to that is,\nBilly. We are partners--you and I. I'm training you for the position.\"\n\n\"Galloway won't come,\" said Tetlow curtly.\n\n\"So much the worse for him,\" retorted Norman placidly. \"No--I've not\nbeen drinking too much, old man--as your worried--old-maid look\nsuggests. Do a little thinking. If Galloway doesn't get me, whom will he\nget?\"\n\n\"You know very well, Norman, there are scores of lawyers, good ones,\nwho'd crawl at his feet for his business. Nowadays, most lawyers are\nalways looking round for a pair of rich man's boots to lick.\"\n\n\"But I am not 'most lawyers,'\" said Norman. \"Of course, if Galloway\ncould make me come to him, he'd be a fool to come to me. But when he\nfinds I'm not coming, why, he'll behave himself--if his business is\nimportant enough for me to bother with.\"\n\n\"But if he doesn't come, Fred?\"\n\n\"Then--my Universal Fuel scheme, or some other equally good. But you\nwill never see me limbering my knees in the anteroom of a rich man, when\nhe needs me and I don't need him.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see,\" said Tetlow, with the air of a sober man patient with\none who is not sober.\n\n\"By the way,\" continued Norman, \"if Galloway says he's too ill to\ncome--or anything of that sort--tell him I'd not care to undertake the\naffairs of a man too old or too feeble to attend to business, as he\nmight die in the midst of it.\"\n\nTetlow's face was such a wondrous exhibit of discomfiture that Norman\nlaughed outright. Evidently he had forestalled his fat friend in a\nscheme to get him to Galloway in spite of himself. \"All right--all\nright,\" said Tetlow fretfully. \"We'll sleep on this. But I don't see why\nyou're so opposed to going to see the man. It looks like snobbishness to\nme--false pride--silly false pride.\"\n\n\"It _is_ snobbishness,\" said Norman. \"But you forget that snobbishness\nrules the world. The way to rule fools is to make them respect you. And\nthe way to make them respect you is by showing them that they are your\ninferiors. I want Galloway's respect because I want his money. And I'll\nnot get his money--as much of it as belongs to me--except by showing\nhim my value. Not my value as a lawyer, for he knows that already, but\nmy value as a man. Do you see?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" snapped Tetlow.\n\n\"That's what it means to be Tetlow. Now, I do see--and that's why I'm\nNorman.\"\n\nTetlow looked at him doubtfully, uncertain whether he had been listening\nto wisdom put in a jocose form of audacious egotism or to the\neffervescings of intoxication. The hint of a smile lurking in the\nsobriety of the powerful features of his extraordinary friend only\nincreased his doubt. Was Norman mocking him, and himself as well? If so,\nwas it the mockery of sober sense or of drunkenness?\n\n\"You seem to be puzzled, Billy,\" said Norman, and Tetlow wondered how he\nhad seen. \"Don't get your brains in a stew trying to understand me. I'm\nacting the way I've always acted--except in one matter. You know that I\nknow what I'm about?\"\n\n\"I certainly do,\" replied his admirer.\n\n\"Then, let it go at that. If you could understand me--the sort of man I\nam, the sort of thing I do--you'd not need me, but would be the whole\nshow yourself--eh? That being true, don't show yourself a commonplace\nnobody by deriding and denying what your brain is unable to comprehend.\nShow yourself a somebody by seeing the limitations of your ability. The\nworld is full of little people who criticise and judge and laugh at and\nmisunderstand the few real intelligences. And very tedious interruptions\nof the scenery those little people are. Don't be one of them. . . . Did\nyou know my wife's father?\"\n\nTetlow startled. \"No--that is, yes,\" he stammered. \"That is, I met him a\nfew times.\"\n\n\"Often enough to find out that he was crazy?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. He explained some of his ideas to me. Yes--he was quite mad,\npoor fellow.\"\n\nNorman gave way to a fit of silent laughter. \"I can imagine,\" he\npresently said, \"what you'd have thought if Columbus or Alexander or\nNapoleon or Stevenson or even the chaps who doped out the telephone and\nthe telegraph--if they had talked to you before they arrived. Or even\nafter they arrived, if they had been explaining some still newer and\nbigger idea not yet accomplished.\"\n\n\"You don't think Mr. Hallowell was mad?\"\n\n\"He was mad, assuming that you are the standard of sanity. Otherwise, he\nwas a great man. There'll be statues erected and pages of the book of\nfame devoted to the men who carry out his ideas.\"\n\n\"His death was certainly a great loss to his daughter,\" said Tetlow in\nhis heaviest, most bourgeois manner.\n\n\"I said he was a great man,\" observed Norman. \"I didn't say he was a\ngreat father. A great man is never a great father. It takes a small man\nto be a great father.\"\n\n\"At any rate, her having no parents or relatives doesn't matter, now\nthat she has you,\" said Tetlow, his manner at once forced and\nconstrained.\n\n\"Um,\" muttered Norman.\n\nSaid Tetlow: \"Perhaps you misunderstood why I--I acted as I did about\nher, toward the last.\"\n\n\"It was of no importance,\" said Norman brusquely. \"I wish to hear\nnothing about it.\"\n\n\"But I must explain, Fred. She piqued me by showing so plainly that she\ndespised me. I must admit the truth, though I've got as much vanity as\nthe next man, and don't like to admit it. She despised me, and it made\nme mad.\"\n\nAn expression of grim satire passed over Norman's face. Said he: \"She\ndespised me, too.\"\n\n\"Yes, she did,\" said Tetlow. \"And both of us were certainly greatly her\nsuperiors--in every substantial way. It seemed to me most--most----\"\n\n\"Most impertinent of her?\" suggested Norman.\n\n\"Precisely. _Most_ impertinent.\"\n\n\"Rather say, ignorant and small. My dear Tetlow, let me tell you\nsomething. Anybody, however insignificant, can be loved. To be loved\nmeans nothing, except possibly a hallucination in the brain of the\nlover. But to _love_--that's another matter. Only a great soul is capable\nof a great love.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" murmured Tetlow sentimentally, preening in a quiet,\ngentle way.\n\nSaid Norman sententiously: \"_You_ stopped loving. It was _I_ that kept\non.\"\n\nTetlow looked uncomfortable. \"Yes--yes,\" he said. \"But we were talking\nof her--of her not appreciating the love she got. And I was about to\nsay--\" Earnestly--\"Fred, she's not to be blamed for her folly! She's\nvery, very young--and has all the weaknesses and vanities of youth----\"\n\n\"Here we are,\" interrupted Norman.\n\nThe hansom had stopped in Forty-second Street before the deserted but\nstill brilliantly lighted entrances to the great hotel. Norman sprang\nout so lightly and surely that Tetlow wondered how it was possible for\nthis to be the man who had been racketing and roistering day after day,\nnight after night for nearly a week. He helped the heavy and awkward\nTetlow to descend, said:\n\n\"You'll have to pay, Bill. I've got less than a dollar left. And I\ntouched Gaskill for a hundred and fifty to-night. You can imagine how\ndrunk he was, to let me have it. How they've been shying off from _me_\nthese last few months!\"\n\n\"And you want _Galloway_ to come to _you_,\" thrust Tetlow, as he counted\nout the money.\n\n\"Don't go back and chew on that,\" laughed Norman. \"It's settled.\" He\ntook the money, gave it to the driver. \"Thanks,\" he said to Tetlow.\n\"I'll pay you to-morrow--that is, later to-day--when you send me another\ncheck.\"\n\n\"Why should you pay for my cab?\" rejoined Tetlow.\n\n\"Because it's easier for me to make money than it is for you,\" replied\nNorman. \"If you were in my position--the position I've been in for\nmonths--would anybody on earth give you three thousand dollars a month?\"\n\nTetlow looked sour. His good nature was rubbing thin in spots.\n\n\"Don't lose your temper,\" laughed Norman. \"I'm pounding away at you\nabout my superiority, partly because I've been drinking, but chiefly for\nyour own good--so that you'll realize I'm right and not mess things with\nGalloway.\"\n\nThey went up to Norman's suite. Norman tried to unlock the door, found\nit already unlocked. He turned the knob, threw the door wide for Tetlow\nto enter first. Then, over Tetlow's shoulder he saw on the marble-topped\ncenter table Dorothy's hat and jacket, the one she had worn away, the\nonly one she had. He stared at them, then at Tetlow. A confused look in\nthe fat, slow face made him say sharply:\n\n\"What does this mean, Tetlow?\"\n\n\"Not so loud, Fred,\" said Tetlow, closing the door into the public hall.\n\"She's in the bedroom--probably asleep. She's been here since\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"You brought her back?\" demanded Norman.\n\n\"She wanted to come. I simply----\"\n\nNorman made a silencing gesture. Tetlow's faltering voice stopped short.\nNorman stood near the table, his hands deep in his trousers' pockets,\nhis gaze fixed upon the hat and jacket. When Tetlow's agitation could\nbear the uncertainties of that silence no longer, he went on:\n\n\"Fred, you mustn't forget how young and inexperienced she is. She's been\nfoolish, but nothing more. She's as pure as when she came into the\nworld. And it's the truth that she wanted to come back. I saw it as soon\nas I began to talk with her.\"\n\n\"What are you chattering about?\" said Norman fiercely. \"Why did you\nmeddle in my affairs? Why did you bring her back?\"\n\n\"I knew she needed you,\" pleaded Tetlow. \"Then, too--I was afraid--I\nknew how you acted before, and I thought you'd not get your gait again\nuntil you had her.\"\n\nNorman gave a short sardonic laugh. \"If you'd only stop trying to\nunderstand me!\" he said.\n\nTetlow was utterly confused. \"But, Fred, you don't realize--not all,\" he\ncried imploringly. \"She discovered--she thinks, I believe--that\nis--she--she--that probably--that in a few months you'll be something\nmore than a husband--and she something more than a wife--that\nyou--that--you and she will be a father and a mother.\"\n\nTetlow's meaning slowly dawned on Norman. He seated himself in his\nfavorite attitude, legs sprawled, fingers interlaced behind his head.\n\n\"Wasn't I right to bring her back--to tell her she needn't fear to\ncome?\" pleaded Tetlow.\n\nNorman made no reply. After a brief silence he said: \"Well, good night,\nold man. Come round to my office any time after ten.\" He rose and gave\nTetlow his hand. \"And arrange for Galloway whenever you like. Good\nnight.\"\n\nTetlow hesitated. \"Fred--you'll not be harsh to her?\" he said.\n\nNorman smiled--a satirical smile, yet exquisitely gentle. \"If you _only_\nwouldn't try to understand me, Bill,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was alone he sat lost in thought. At last he rang for a bell\nboy. And when the boy came, he said: \"That door there\"--indicating one\nin the opposite wall of the sitting room--\"what does it lead into?\"\n\n\"Another bedroom, sir.\"\n\n\"Unlock it, and tell them at the office I wish that room added to my\nsuite.\"\n\nAs soon as the additional bedroom was at his disposal, he went in and\nbegan to undress. When he had taken off coat and waistcoat he paused to\ntelephone to the office a call for eight o'clock. As he finished and\nhung up the receiver, a sound from the direction of the sitting room\nmade him glance in there. On the threshold of the other bedroom stood\nhis wife. She was in her nightgown; her hair, done in a single thick\nbraid, hung down across her bosom. There was in the room and upon her\nchildish loveliness the strange commingling of lights and shadows that\nfalls when the electricity is still on and the early morning light is\npushing in at the windows. They looked at each other in silence for some\ntime. If she was frightened or in the least embarrassed she did not show\nit. She simply looked at him, while ever so slowly a smile dawned--a\ngleam in the eyes, a flutter round the lips, growing merrier and\nmerrier. He did not smile. He continued to regard her gravely.\n\n\"I heard you and Mr. Tetlow come in,\" she said. \"Then--you talked so\nlong--I fell asleep again. I only this minute awakened.\"\n\n\"Well, now you can go to sleep again,\" said he.\n\n\"But I'm not a bit sleepy. What are you doing in that room?\"\n\nShe advanced toward his door. He stood aside. She peeped in. She was so\nclose to him that her nightgown brushed the bosom of his shirt. \"Another\nbedroom!\" she exclaimed. \"Just like ours.\"\n\n\"I didn't wish to disturb you,\" said he, calm and grave.\n\n\"But you wouldn't have been disturbing me,\" protested she, leaning\nagainst the door frame, less than two feet away and directly facing him.\n\n\"I'll stay on here,\" said he.\n\nShe gazed at him with great puzzled eyes. \"Aren't you glad I'm back?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said he with a polite smile. \"But I must get some sleep.\"\nAnd he moved away.\n\n\"You must let me tell you how I happened to go and why I came----\"\n\n\"Please,\" he interrupted, looking at her with a piercing though not in\nthe least unfriendly expression that made her grow suddenly pale and\nthoughtful. \"I do not wish to hear about it--not now--not ever. Tetlow\ntold me all that it's necessary for me to know. You have come to stay, I\nassume?\"\n\n\"Yes--if\"--her lip quivered--\"if you'll let me.\"\n\n\"There can be no question of that,\" said he with the same polite gravity\nhe had maintained throughout.\n\n\"You want me to leave you alone?\"\n\n\"Please. I need sleep badly--and I've only three hours.\"\n\n\"You are--angry with me?\"\n\nHe looked placidly into her lovely, swimming eyes. \"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"But how can you help being? I acted dreadfully.\"\n\nHe smiled gently. \"But you are back--and the incident is closed.\"\n\nShe looked down at the carpet, her fingers playing with her braid,\ntwisting and untwisting its strands. He stood waiting to close the door.\nShe said, without lifting her eyes--said in a quiet, expressionless way,\n\"I have killed your love?\"\n\n\"I'll not trouble you any more,\" evaded he. And he laid his hand\nsignificantly upon the knob.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she murmured. Then, with a quick apologetic glance\nat him, \"But I'm very inconsiderate. You want to sleep. Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" said he, beginning to close the door.\n\nShe impulsively stood close before him, lifted her small white face, as\nif for a kiss. \"Do you forgive me?\" she asked. \"I was foolish. I didn't\nunderstand--till I went back. Then--nothing was the same. And I knew I\nwasn't fitted for that life--and didn't really care for him--and----\"\n\nHe kissed her on the brow. \"Don't agitate yourself,\" said he. \"And we\nwill never speak of this again.\"\n\nShe shrank as if he had struck her. Her head drooped, and her shoulders.\nWhen she was clear of the door, he quietly closed it.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nIt was not many minutes after ten when Tetlow hurried into Norman's\noffice. \"Galloway's coming at eleven!\" said he, with an air of triumph.\n\n\"So you mulled over what I said and decided that I was not altogether\ndrunk?\"\n\n\"I wasn't sure of that,\" replied Tetlow. \"But I was afraid you'd be\noffended if I didn't try to get him. He gave me no trouble at all. As\nsoon as I told him you'd be glad to see him at your office, he astounded\nme by saying he'd come.\"\n\n\"He and I have had dealings,\" said Norman. \"He understood at once. I\nalways know my way when I'm dealing with a big man. It's only the little\npeople that are muddled and complex. I hope you'll not forget this\nlesson, Billy.\"\n\n\"I shan't,\" promised Tetlow.\n\n\"We are to be partners,\" pursued Norman. \"We shall be intimately\nassociated for years. You'll save me a vast amount of time and energy\nand yourself a vast amount of fuming and fretting, if you'll simply\naccept what I say, without discussion. When I want discussion I'll ask\nyour advice.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't think it's worth much,\" said Tetlow humbly, \"and I\nguess it isn't.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, invaluable,\" declared Norman with flattering emphasis.\n\"Where you lack and I excel is in decision and action. I'll often get\nyou to tell me what ought to be done, and then I'll make you do\nit--which you'd never dare, by yourself.\"\n\nAt eleven sharp Galloway came, looking as nearly like a dangerous old\neagle as a human being well could. Rapacious, merciless, tyrannical; a\nfamous philanthropist. Stingy to pettiness; a giver away of millions.\nRigidly honest, yet absolutely unscrupulous; faithful to the last letter\nof his given word, yet so treacherous where his sly mind could nose out\na way to evade the spirit of his agreements that his name was a synonym\nfor unfaithfulness. An assiduous and groveling snob, yet so militantly\ndemocratic that, unless his interest compelled, he would not employ any\nmember of the \"best families\" in any important capacity. He seemed a\nbundle of contradictions. In fact he was profoundly consistent. That is\nto say, he steadily pursued in every thought and act the gratification\nof his two passions--wealth and power. He lost no seen opportunity,\nhowever shameful, to add to his fortune or to amuse himself with the\nhuman race, which he regarded with the unpitying contempt characteristic\nof every cold nature born or risen to success.\n\nHis theory of life--and it is the theory that explains most great\nfinancial successes, however they may pretend or believe--his theory of\nlife was that he did not need friends because the friends of a strong\nman weaken and rob him, but that he did need enemies because he could\ngrow rich and powerful destroying and despoiling them. To him friends\nsuggested the birds living in a tree. They might make the tree more\nromantic to the unthinking observer; but they in fact ate its budding\nleaves and its fruit and rotted its bough joints with their filthy\nnests.\n\nWe Americans are probably nearest to children of any race in\ncivilization. The peculiar conditions of life--their almost Arcadian\nsimplicity--up to a generation or so ago, gave us a false training in\nthe study of human nature. We believe what the good preacher, the\nnovelist and the poet, all as ignorant of life as nursery books, tell us\nabout the human heart. We fancy that in a social system modeled upon the\ncruel and immoral system of Nature, success is to the good and kind.\nLife is like the pious story in the Sunday-school library; evil is the\nexception and to practice the simple virtues is to tread with sure step\nthe highway to riches and fame. This sort of ignorance is taught, is\nproclaimed, is apparently accepted throughout the world. Literature and\nthe drama, representing life as it is dreamed by humanity, life as it\nperhaps may be some day, create an impression which defies the plain\ndaily and hourly mockings of experience. Because weak and petty\noffenders are often punished, the universe is pictured as sternly\nenforcing the criminal codes enacted by priests or lawyers. But, while\nall the world half inclines to this agreeable mendacity about life, only\nin America of all civilization is the mendacity accepted as gospel, and\nsuspicion about it frowned upon as the heresy of cynicism. So the\nGalloways prosper and are in high moral repute. Some day we shall learn\nthat a social system which is merely a slavish copy of Nature's\nbarbarous and wasteful sway of the survival of the toughest could be and\nought to be improved upon by the intelligence of the human race. Some\nday we shall put Nature in its proper place as kindergarten teacher, and\ndrop it from godship and erect enlightened human understanding instead.\nBut that is a long way off. Meanwhile the Galloways will reign, and will\nassure us that they won their success by the Decalogue and the Golden\nRule--and will be believed by all who seek to assure for themselves in\nadvance almost certain failure at material success in the arena of\naction.\n\nBut they will not be believed by men of ambition, pushing resolutely for\npower and wealth. So Frederick Norman knew precisely what he was facing\nwhen Galloway's tall gaunt figure and face of the bird of prey appeared\nbefore him. Galloway had triumphed and was triumphing not through\nobedience to the Sunday sermons and the silly novels, poems, plays, and\nthe nonsense chattered by the obscure multitudes whom the mighty few\nexploit, but through obedience to the conditions imposed by our social\nsystem. If he raised wages a little, it was in order that he might have\nexcuse for raising prices a great deal. If he gave away millions, it was\nfor his fame, and usually to quiet the scandal over some particularly\nwicked wholesale robbery. No, Galloway was not a witness to the might of\naltruistic virtue as a means to triumph. Charity and all the other forms\nof chicanery by which the many are defrauded and fooled by the few--those\n\"virtues\" he understood and practiced. But justice--humanity's ages-long\ndream that at last seems to glitter as a hope in the horizon of the\nfuture--justice--not legal justice, nor moral justice, but human\njustice--that idea would have seemed to him ridiculous, Utopian,\nsomething for the women and the children and the socialists.\n\nNorman understood Galloway, and Galloway understood Norman. Galloway,\nwith an old man's garrulity and a confirmed moral poseur's eagerness\nabout appearances, began to unfold his virtuous reasons for the\nimpending break with Burroughs--the industrial and financial war out of\nwhich he expected to come doubly rich and all but supreme. Midway he\nstopped.\n\n\"You are not listening,\" said he sharply to the young man.\n\nTheir eyes met. Norman's eyes were twinkling. \"No,\" said he, \"I am\nwaiting.\"\n\nThere was the suggestion of an answering gleam of sardonic humor in\nGalloway's cold gray eyes. \"Waiting for what?\"\n\n\"For you to finish with me as father confessor, to begin with me as\nlawyer. Pray don't hurry. My time is yours.\" This with a fine air of\nutmost suavity and respect.\n\nIn fact, while Galloway was doddering on and on with his fake\nmoralities, Norman was thinking of his own affairs, was wondering at his\nindifference about Dorothy. The night before--the few hours before--when\nhe had dealt with her so calmly, he, even as he talked and listened and\nacted, had assumed that the enormous amount of liquor he had been\nconsuming was in some way responsible. He had said to himself, \"When I\nam over this, when I have had sleep and return to the normal, I shall\nagain be the foolish slave of all these months.\" But here he was, sober,\nhaving taken only enough whisky to prevent an abrupt let-down--here he\nwas viewing her in the same tranquil light. No longer all his life; no\nlonger even dominant; only a part of life--and he was by no means\ncertain that she was an important part.\n\nHow explain the mystery of the change? Because she had voluntarily come\nback, did he feel that she was no longer baffling but was definitely\nhis? Or had passion running madly on and on dropped--perhaps not dead,\nbut almost dead--from sheer exhaustion?--was it weary of racing and\ncontent to saunter and to stroll? . . . He could not account for the\nchange. He only knew that he who had been quite mad was now quite\nsane. . . . Would he like to be rid of her? Did he regret that they were\ntied together? No, curiously enough. It was high time he got married;\nshe would do as well as another. She had beauty, youth, amiability,\nphysical charm for him. There was advantage in the fact that her\ninferiority to him, her dependence on him, would enable him to take as\nmuch or as little of her as he might feel disposed, to treat her as the\nwarrior must ever treat his entire domestic establishment from wife down\nto pet dog or cat or baby. . . . No, he did not regret Josephine. He could\nsee now disadvantages greater than her advantages. All of value she\nwould have brought him he could get for himself, and she would have been\ntroublesome--exacting, disputing his sway, demanding full value or more\nin return for the love she was giving with such exalted notions of its\nworth.\n\n\"You are married?\" Galloway suddenly said, interrupting his own speech\nand Norman's thought.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Norman.\n\n\"Just married, I believe?\"\n\n\"Just.\"\n\nYoung and old, high and low, successful and failed, we are a race of\nadvice-givers. As for Galloway, he was not one to neglect that showy\nform of inexpensive benevolence. \"Have plenty of children,\" said he.\n\n\"And keep your family in the country till they grow up. Town's no place\nfor women. They go crazy. Women--and most men--have no initiative. They\nthink only about whatever's thrust at them. In the country it'll be\ntheir children and domestic things. In town it'll be getting and\nspending money.\"\n\nNorman was struck by this. \"I think I'll take your advice,\" said he.\n\n\"A man's home ought to be a retreat, not an inn. We are humoring the\nwomen too much. They are forgetting who earns what they spend in\nexhibiting themselves. If a woman wants that sort of thing, let her get\nout and earn it. Why should she expect it from the man who has\nundertaken her support because he wanted a wife to take care of his\nhouse and a mother for his children? If a woman doesn't like the job,\nall right. But if she takes it and accepts its pay, why, she should do\nits work.\"\n\n\"Flawless logic,\" said Norman.\n\n\"When I hire a man to work, he doesn't expect to idle about showing\nother people how handsome he is in the clothes my money pays for. Not\nthat marriage is altogether a business--not at all. But, my dear sir--\"\nAnd Galloway brought his cane down with the emphasis of one speaking\nfrom a heart full of bitter experience--\"unless it is a business at\nbottom, organized and conducted on sound business principles, there's no\nsentiment either. We are human beings--and that means we are first of\nall _business_ beings, engaged in getting food, clothing, shelter. No\nsentiment--_no_ sentiment, sir, is worth while that isn't firmly grounded.\nIt's a house without a foundation. It's a steeple without a church under\nit.\"\n\nNorman looked at the old man with calm penetrating eyes. \"I shall\nconduct my married life on a sound, business basis, or not at all,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Galloway. \"That's what I said forty years ago--No, I\ndidn't. I had no sense about such matters then. In my youth the men knew\nnothing about the woman question.\" He smiled grimly. \"I see signs that\nthey are learning.\"\n\nThen as abruptly as he had left the affairs he was there to discuss he\nreturned to them. His mind seemed to have freed itself of all\nirrelevancy and superfluity, as a stream often runs from a faucet with\nmuch spluttering and rather muddy at first, then steadies and clears.\nNorman gave him the attention one can get only from a good mind that is\ninterested in the subject and understands it thoroughly. Such attention\nnot merely receives the words and ideas as they fall from the mouth of\nhim who utters them, but also seems to draw them by a sort of suction\nfaster and in greater abundance. It was this peculiar ability of giving\nattention, as much as any other one quality, that gave Norman's clients\ntheir confidence in him. Galloway, than whom no man was shrewder judge\nof men, showed in his gratified eyes and voice, long before he had\nfinished, how strongly his conviction of Norman's high ability was\nconfirmed.\n\nWhen Galloway ended, Norman rapidly and in clear and simple sentences\nsummarized what Galloway had said. \"That is right?\" he asked.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Galloway admiringly. \"What a gift of clear statement\nyou have, young man!\"\n\n\"It has won me my place,\" said Norman. \"As to your campaign, I can tell\nyou now that the legal part of it can be arranged. That is what the law\nis for--to enable a man to do whatever he wants. The penalties are for\nthose who have the stupidity to try to do things in an unlawful way.\"\n\nGalloway laughed. \"I had heard that they were for doing unlawful\nthings.\"\n\n\"Nothing is unlawful,\" said Norman, \"except in method.\"\n\n\"That's an interesting view of courts of justice.\"\n\n\"But we have no courts of justice. We have only courts of law.\"\n\nGalloway threw back his head and laughed till the tears rolled down his\ncheeks. \"What a gift for clear statement!\" he cried.\n\nNorman beamed appreciation of a compliment so flattering. But he went\nback to business. \"As I was saying, you can do what you want to do. You\nwish me to show you how. In our modern way of doing things, the relation\nof lawyer and client has somewhat changed. To illustrate by this case,\nyou are the bear with the taste for honey and the strength to rob the\nbees. I am the honey bird--that is, the modern lawyer--who can show you\nthe way to the hive. Most of the honey birds--as yet--are content with a\nvery small share of the honey--whatever the bear happens to be unable to\nfind room for. But I--\" Norman's eyes danced and his strong mouth curved\nin a charming smile--\"I am a honey bird with a bear appetite.\"\n\nGalloway was sitting up stiffly. \"I don't quite follow you, sir,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Yet I am plain enough. My ability at clear statement has not deserted\nme. If I show you the way through the tangled forest of the law to this\nhive you scent--I must be a partner in the honey.\"\n\nGalloway rose. \"Your conceptions of your profession--and of me, I may\nsay--are not attractive. I have always been, and am willing and anxious\nto pay liberally--more liberally than anyone else--for legal advice. But\nmy business, sir, is my own.\"\n\nNorman rose, his expression one of apology and polite disappointment. \"I\nsee I misunderstood your purpose in coming to me,\" said he. \"Let us take\nno more of each other's time.\"\n\n\"And what did you think my object was in coming?\" demanded Galloway.\n\n\"To get from me what you realized you could get nowhere else--which\nmeant, as an old experienced trader like you must have known, that you\nwere ready to pay my price. Of course, if you can get elsewhere the\nassistance you need, why, you would be most unwise to come to me.\"\n\nGalloway moved toward the door. \"And you might have charged practically\nany fee you wished,\" said he, laughing satirically. \"Young man, you are\nmaking the mistake that is ruining this generation. You wish to get rich\nall at once. You are not willing to be patient and to work and to build\nyour fortune solidly and slowly.\"\n\nNorman smiled as at a good joke. \"What an asset to you strong men has\nbeen the vague hope in the minds of the masses that each poor devil of\nthem will have his turn to loot and grow rich. I used to think ignorance\nkept the present system going. But I have discovered that it is that\nsly, silly, corrupt hope. But, sir, it does not catch me. I shall not\nwork for you and the other strong men, and patiently wait my turn that\nwould never come. My time is _now_.\"\n\n\"You threaten me!\" cried Galloway furiously.\n\n\"Threaten you?\" exclaimed Norman, amazed.\n\n\"You think, because I have given you, my lawyer, my secrets, that you\ncan compel me----\"\n\nWith an imperious gesture Norman stopped him. \"Good day, sir,\" he said\nhaughtily. \"Your secrets are safe with me. I am a lawyer, not a\nfinancier.\"\n\nGalloway was disconcerted. \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Norman,\" he said. \"I\nmisunderstood you. I thought I heard you say in effect that you purposed\nto be rich, and that you purposed to compel me to make you so.\"\n\n\"So I did,\" replied Norman. \"But not by the methods you financiers are\nso adept at using. Not by high-class blackmail and blackjacking. I meant\nthat my abilities were such that you and your fellow masters of modern\nsociety would be compelled to employ me on my own terms. A few moments\nago you outlined to me a plan. It may be you can find other lawyers\ncompetent to steer it through the channel of the law. I doubt it. I may\nexaggerate my value. But--\" He smiled pleasantly--\"I don't think so.\"\n\nIn this modern world of ours there is no more delicate or more important\nbranch of the art of material success than learning to play one's own\ntune on the trumpets of fame. To those who watch careers intelligently\nand critically, and not merely with mouth agape and ears awag for\nwhatever sounds the winds of credulity bear, there is keen interest in\nnoting how differently this high art is practiced by the\nfame-seekers--how well some modest heroes disguise themselves before\nessaying the trumpet, how timidly some play, how brazenly others. It is\nan art of infinite variety. How many there are who can echo\nShakespeare's sad lament, through Hamlet's lips--\"I lack advancement!\"\nThose are they who have wholly neglected, as did Shakespeare, this\nessential part of the art of advancement--Shakespeare, who lived almost\nobscure and was all but forgotten for two centuries after his death.\n\nNorman, frankly seeking mere material success, and with the colossal\negotism that disdains egotism and shrugs at the danger of being accused\nof it--Norman did not hesitate to proclaim his own merits. He reasoned\nthat he had the wares, that crying them would attract attention to them,\nthat he whose attention was attracted, if he were a judge of wares and a\nseeker of the best, would see that the Norman wares were indeed as\nNorman cried them. At first blush Galloway was amused by Norman's candid\nself-esteem. But he had often heard of Norman's conceit--and in a long\nand busy life he had not seen an able man who was unaware of his\nability; any more than he had seen a pretty woman unaware of her\nprettiness. So, at second blush, Galloway was tempted by Norman's calm\nstrong blast upon his own trumpet to look again at the wares.\n\n\"I always have had a high opinion of you, young man,\" said he, with\nlaughing eyes. \"Almost as high an opinion as you have of yourself. Think\nover the legal side of my plan. When you get your thoughts in order, let\nme know--and make me a proposition as to your own share. Does that\nsatisfy you?\"\n\n\"It's all I ask,\" said Norman.\n\nAnd they parted on the friendliest terms--and Norman knew that his\nfortune was assured, if Galloway lived another nine months. When he was\nalone, the sweat burst out upon him and, trembling from head to foot, he\nlocked his door and flung himself at full length upon the rug. It was\nhalf an hour before the fit of silent hysterical reaction passed\nsufficiently to let him gather strength to rise. He tottered to his desk\nchair, and sat with his head buried in his arms upon the desk. After a\nwhile the telephone at his side rang insistently. He took the receiver\nin a hand he could not steady.\n\n\"Yes?\" he called.\n\n\"It's Tetlow. How'd you come out?\"\n\n\"Oh--\" He paused to stiffen his throat to attack the words\nnaturally--\"all right. We go ahead.\"\n\n\"With G.?\"\n\n\"Certainly. But keep quiet. Don't let him know you've heard, if you see\nhim or he sends for you. Remember, it's in my hands entirely.\"\n\n\"Trust me.\" Tetlow's voice, suppressed and jubilant, suggested a fat,\nhoarse rooster trying to finish a crow before a coming stone from a farm\nboy reaches him. \"It seems natural and easy to you, old man. But I'm\nabout crazy with joy. I'll come right over.\"\n\n\"No. I'm going home.\"\n\n\"Can't I see you there?\"\n\n\"No. I've other matters to attend to. Come about lunch time\nto-morrow--to the office, here.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Tetlow disappointedly, and Norman rang off.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nIn the faces of men who have dominion of whatever kind over their fellow\nmen--be it the brutal rule of the prize fighter over his gang or the\napparently gentle sway of the apparently meek bishop over his loving\nflock--in the faces of all men of power there is a dangerous look. They\nmay never lose their tempers. They may never lift their voices. They may\nbe ever suave and civil. The dangerous look is there--and the danger\nbehind it. And the sense of that look and of its cause has a certain\nrestraining effect upon all but the hopelessly impudent or solidly\ndense. Norman was one of the men without fits of temper. In his moments\nof irritation, no one ever felt that a storm of violent language might\nbe impending. But the danger signal flaunted from his face. Danger of\nwhat? No one could have said. Most people would have laughed at the idea\nthat so even tempered a man, pleased with himself and with the world,\ncould ever be dangerous. Yet everyone had instinctively respected that\ndanger flag--until Dorothy.\n\nPerhaps it had struck for her--had really not been there when she looked\nat him. Perhaps she had been too inexperienced, perhaps too\nself-centered, to see it. Perhaps she had never before seen his face in\nan hour of weariness and relaxation--when the true character, the\ndominating and essential trait or traits, shows nakedly upon the\nsurface, making the weak man or woman look pitiful, the strong man or\nwoman formidable.\n\nHowever that may be, when he walked into the sitting room, greeted her\nplacidly and kissed her on the brow, she, glancing uncertainly up at\nhim, saw that danger signal for the first time. She studied his face,\nher own face wearing her expression of the puzzled child. No, not quite\nthat expression as it always had been theretofore, but a modified form\nof it. To any self-centered, self-absorbed woman--there comes in her\nmarried life, unless she be married to a booby, a time, an hour, a\nmoment even--for it can be narrowed down to a point--when she takes her\nfirst _seeing_ look at the man upon whom she is dependent for protection,\nwhether spiritual or material, or both. In her egotism and vanity she\nhas been regarding him as her property. Suddenly, and usually\ndisagreeably, it has been revealed to her that she is his property. That\nhour had come for Dorothy Norman. And she was looking at her husband,\nwas wondering who and what he was.\n\n\"You've had your lunch?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" replied she.\n\n\"You have been out for the air?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You didn't tell me what to do.\"\n\nHe smiled good humoredly. \"Oh, you had no money.\"\n\n\"Yes--a little. But I--\" She halted.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You hadn't told me what to do,\" she repeated, as if on mature thought\nthat sentence expressed the whole matter.\n\nHe felt in his pockets, found a small roll of bills. He laid twenty-five\ndollars on the table. \"I'll keep thirty,\" he said, \"as I shan't have any\nmore till I see Tetlow to-morrow. Now, fly out and amuse yourself. I'm\ngoing to sleep. Don't wake me till you're ready for dinner.\"\n\nAnd he went into his bedroom and closed the door. When he awoke, he saw\nthat it was dark outside, and some note in the din of street noises from\nfar below made him feel that it was late. He wrapped a bathrobe round\nhim, opened the door into the sitting room. It was dark.\n\n\"Dorothy!\" he called.\n\n\"Yes,\" promptly responded the small quiet voice, so near that he started\nback.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed, and switched on the light. \"There you are--by the\nwindow. What were you doing, in the dark?\"\n\nShe was dressed precisely as when he had last seen her. She was sitting\nwith her hands listless in her lap and her face a moving and beautiful\nexpression of melancholy dreams. On the table were the bills--where he\nhad laid them. \"You've been out?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I've been--waiting.\"\n\n\"For what?\" laughed he.\n\n\"For--I don't know,\" she replied. \"Just waiting.\"\n\n\"But there's nothing to wait for.\"\n\nShe looked at him interrogatively. \"No--I suppose not,\" she said.\n\nHe went back into his room and glanced at his watch. \"Eleven o'clock!\"\nhe cried. \"Why didn't you wake me? You must be nearly starved.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am hungry,\" said she.\n\nHer patient, passive resignation irritated him. \"I'm ravenous,\" he said.\n\"I'll dress--and you dress, too. We'll go downstairs to supper.\"\n\nWhen he reappeared in the sitting room, in a dinner jacket, she was\nagain seated near the window, hands listless in her lap and eyes gazing\ndreamily into vacancy. But she was now dressed in the black chiffon and\nthe big black hat. He laughed. \"You are prompt and obedient,\" said he.\n\"Nothing like hunger to subdue.\"\n\nA faint flush tinged her lovely skin; the look of the child that has\nbeen struck appeared in her eyes.\n\nHe cast about in his mind for the explanation. Did she think he meant it\nwas need that had brought her meekly back to him? That was true enough,\nbut he had not intended to hint it. In high good humor because he was so\ndelightfully hungry and was about to get food, he cried: \"Do cheer up!\nThere's nothing to be sad about--nothing.\"\n\nShe lifted her large eyes and gazed at him timidly. \"What are you going\nto do with me?\"\n\n\"Take you downstairs and feed you.\"\n\n\"But I mean--afterward?\"\n\n\"Bring--or send--you up here to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Are you going away?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Away from me.\"\n\nHe looked at her with amused eyes. She was exquisitely lovely; never had\nhe seen her lovelier. It delighted him to note her charms--the charms\nthat had enslaved him--not a single charm missing--and to feel that he\nwas no longer their slave, was his own master again.\n\nA strange look swept across her uncannily mobile face--a look of wonder,\nof awe, of fear, of dread. \"You don't even like me any more,\" she said\nin her colorless way.\n\n\"What have I done to make you think I dislike you?\" said he pleasantly.\n\nShe gazed down in silence.\n\n\"You need have no fear,\" said he. \"You are my wife. You will be well\ntaken care of, and you will not be annoyed. What more can I say?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she murmured.\n\nHe winced. She had made him feel like an unpleasant cross between an\nalms-giver and a bully. \"Now,\" said he, with forced but resolute\ncheerfulness, \"we will eat, drink and be merry.\"\n\nOn the way down in the elevator he watched her out of the corner of his\neye. When they reached the hall leading to the supper room he touched\nher arm and halted her. \"My dear,\" said he in the pleasant voice which\nyet somehow never failed to secure attention and obedience, \"there will\nbe some of my acquaintances in there at supper. I don't want them to see\nyou with that whipped dog look. There's no occasion for it.\"\n\nHer lip trembled. \"I'll do my best,\" said she.\n\n\"Let's see you smile,\" laughed he. \"You have often shown me that you\nknow the woman's trick of wearing what feelings you choose on the\noutside. So don't pretend that you've got to look as if you were about\nto be hung for a crime you didn't commit. There!--that's better.\"\n\nAnd indeed to a casual glance she looked the happy bride trying--not\nvery successfully--to seem used to her husband and her new status.\n\n\"Hold it!\" he urged gayly. \"I've no fancy for leading round a lovely\nmartyr in chains. Especially as you're about as healthy and well placed\na person as I know. And you'll feel as well as you look when you've had\nsomething to eat.\"\n\nWhether it was obedience or the result of a decision to drop an\nunprofitable pose he could not tell, but as soon as they were seated and\nshe had a bill of fare before her and was reading it, her expression of\nhappiness lost its last suggestion of being forced. \"Crab meat!\" she\nsaid. \"I love it!\"\n\n\"Two portions of crab meat,\" he said to the waiter with pad and pencil\nat attention.\n\n\"Oh, I don't want that much,\" she protested.\n\n\"You forget that I am hungry,\" rejoined he. \"And when I am hungry, the\nprice of food begins to go up.\" He addressed himself to the waiter:\n\"After that a broiled grouse--with plenty of hominy--and grilled sweet\npotatoes--and a salad of endive and hothouse tomatoes--and I know the\ndifference between hothouse tomatoes and the other kinds. Next--some\ncheese--Coullomieres--yes, you have it--I got the steward to get it--and\ntoasted crackers--the round kind, not the square--and not the hard ones\nthat unsettle the teeth--and--what kind of ice, my dear?--or would you\nprefer a fresh peach flambee?\"\n\n\"Yes--I think so,\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"You hear, waiter?--and a bottle of--there's the head waiter--ask\nhim--he knows the champagne I like.\"\n\nAs Norman had talked, in the pleasant, insistent voice, the waiter had\nroused from the air of mindless, mechanical sloth characteristic of the\nNew York waiter--unless and until a fee below his high expectation is\noffered. When he said the final \"very good, sir,\" it was with the accent\nof real intelligence.\n\nDorothy was smiling, with the amusement of youth and inexperience. \"What\na lot of trouble you took about it,\" said she.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Anything worth doing at all is worth taking\ntrouble about. You will see. We shall get results. The supper will be\nthe best this house can put together.\"\n\n\"You can have anything you want in this world, if you only can pay for\nit,\" said she.\n\n\"That's what most people think,\" replied he. \"But the truth is, the\npaying is only a small part of the art of getting what one wants.\"\n\nShe glanced nervously at him. \"I'm beginning to realize that I'm\ndreadfully inexperienced,\" said she.\n\n\"There's nothing discouraging in that,\" said he. \"Lack of experience can\nbe remedied. But not lack of judgment. It takes the great gift of\njudgment to enable one to profit by mistakes, to decide what is the real\nlesson of an experience.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I haven't any judgment, either,\" confessed she.\n\n\"That remains to be seen.\"\n\nShe hesitated--ventured: \"What do you think is my worst fault?\"\n\nHe shook his head laughingly. \"We are going to have a happy supper.\"\n\n\"Do you think I am very vain?\" persisted she.\n\n\"Who's been telling you so?\"\n\n\"Mr. Tetlow. He gave me an awful talking to, just before I--\" She paused\nat the edge of the forbidden ground. \"He didn't spare me,\" she went on.\n\"He said I was a vain, self-centered little fool.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I was very angry. I told him he had no right to accuse me of that. I\nreminded him that he had never heard me say a word about myself.\"\n\n\"And did he say that the vainest people were just that way--never\nspeaking of themselves, never thinking of anything else?\"\n\n\"Oh, he told you what he said,\" cried she.\n\n\"No,\" laughed he.\n\nShe reddened. \"_You_ think I'm vain?\"\n\nHe made a good-humoredly satirical little bow. \"I think you are\ncharming,\" said he. \"It would be a waste of time to look at or to think\nof anyone else when oneself is the most charming and interesting person\nin the world. Still--\" He put into his face and voice a suggestion of\ngravity that caught her utmost attention--\"if one is to get anywhere, is\nto win consideration from others--and happiness for oneself--one simply\nmust do a little thinking about others--occasionally.\"\n\nHer eyes lowered. A faint color tinged her cheeks.\n\n\"The reason most of us are so uncomfortable--downright unhappy most of\nthe time--is that we never really take our thoughts off our precious\nfascinating selves. The result is that some day we find that the\nliking--and friendship--and love--of those around us has limits--and we\nare left severely alone. Of course, if one has a great deal of money,\none can buy excellent imitations of liking and friendship and even\nlove--I ought to say, especially love----\"\n\nThe color flamed in her face.\n\n\"But,\" he went on, \"if one is in modest circumstances or poor, one has\nto take care.\"\n\n\"Or dependent,\" she said, with one of those unexpected flashes of subtle\nintelligence that so complicated the study of her character. He had been\ntalking to amuse himself rather than with any idea of her understanding.\nHer sudden bright color and her two words--\"or dependent\"--roused him to\nsee that she thought he was deliberately giving her a savage lecture\nfrom the cover of general remarks. \"With the vanity of the typical\nwoman,\" he said to himself, \"she always imagines _she_ is the subject of\neveryone's thought and talk.\"\n\n\"Or dependent,\" said he to her, easily. \"I wasn't thinking of you, but\nyours _is_ a case in point. Come, now--nothing to look blue about! Here's\nsomething to eat. No, it's for the next table.\"\n\n\"You won't let me explain,\" she protested, between the prudence of\nreproach and the candor of anger.\n\n\"There's nothing to explain,\" replied he. \"Don't bother about the\nmistakes of yesterday. Remember them--yes. If one has a good memory, to\nforget is impossible--not to say unwise. But there ought to be no more\nheat or sting in the memory of past mistakes than in the memory of last\nyear's mosquito bites.\"\n\nThe first course of the supper arrived. Her nervousness vanished, and he\ngot far away from the neighborhood of the subjects that, even in\nremotest hint, could not but agitate her. And as the food and the wine\nasserted their pacific and beatific sway, she and he steadily moved into\nbetter and better humor with each other. Her beauty grew until it had\nhim thinking that never, not in the most spiritual feminine conceptions\nof the classic painters, had he seen a loveliness more ethereal. Her\nskin was so exquisite, the coloring of her hair and eyes and of her lips\nwas so delicately fine that it gave her the fragility of things\nbordering upon the supernal--of rare exotics, of sunset and moonbeam\neffects. No, he had been under no spell of illusion as to her beauty. It\nwas a reality--the more fascinating because it waxed and waned not with\nregularity of period but capriciously.\n\nHe began to look round furtively, to see what effect this wife of his\nwas producing on others. These last few months, through prudence as much\nas through pride, he had been cultivating the habit of ignoring his\nsurroundings; he would not invite cold salutations or obvious avoidance\nof speaking. He now discovered many of his former associates--and his\nvanity dilated as he noted how intensely they were interested in his\nwife.\n\nSome men of ability have that purest form of egotism which makes one\nprofoundly content with himself, genuinely indifferent to the approval\nor the disapproval of others. Norman's vanity had a certain amount of\nalloy. He genuinely disdained his fellow-men--their timidity, their\nhypocrisy, their servility, their limited range of ideas. He was\nindifferent to the verge of insensibility as to their adverse criticism.\nBut at the same time it was necessary to his happiness that he get from\nthem evidences of their admiration and envy. With that amusing hypocrisy\nwhich tinges all human nature, he concealed from himself the\nsatisfaction, the joy even, he got out of the showy side of his\nposition. And no feature of his infatuation for Dorothy surprised him so\nmuch as the way it rode rough shod and reckless over his snobbishness.\n\nWith the fading of infatuation had come many reflections upon the\npractical aspects of what he had done. It pleased him with himself to\nfind that, in this first test, he had not the least regret, but on the\ncontrary a genuine pride in the courageous independence he had\nshown--another and strong support to his conviction of his superiority\nto his fellow-men. He might be somewhat snobbish--who was not?--who else\nin his New York was less than supersaturated with snobbishness? But\nsnobbishness, the determining quality in the natures of all the women\nand most of the men he knew, had shown itself one of the incidental\nqualities in his own nature. After all, reflected he, it took a man, a\ngood deal of a man, to do what he had done, and not to regret it, even\nin the hour of disillusionment. And it must be said for this egotistic\nself-approval of his that like all his judgments there was sound merit\nof truth in it. The vanity of the nincompoop is ridiculous. The vanity\nof the man of ability is amusing and no doubt due to a defective point\nof view upon the proportions of the universe; but it is not without\nexcuse, and those who laugh might do well to discriminate even as they\nguffaw.\n\nLooking discreetly about, Norman was suddenly confronted by the face of\nJosephine Burroughs, only two tables away.\n\nUntil their eyes squarely met he did not know she was there, or even in\nAmerica. Before he could make a beginning of glancing away, she gave him\nher sweetest smile and her friendliest bow. And Dorothy, looking to see\nto whom he was speaking, was astonished to receive the same radiance of\ncordiality. Norman was pleased at the way his wife dealt with the\nsituation. She returned both bow and smile in her own quiet, slightly\nreserved way of gentle dignity.\n\n\"Who was that, speaking?\" asked she.\n\n\"Miss Burroughs. You must remember her.\"\n\nHe noted it as characteristic that she said, quite sincerely: \"Oh, so it\nis. I didn't remember her. That is the girl you were engaged to.\"\n\n\"Yes--'the nice girl uptown,'\" said he.\n\n\"I didn't like her,\" said Dorothy, with evident small interest in the\nsubject. \"She was vain.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't like her way of being vain,\" suggested Norman.\n\"Everyone is vain; so, if we disliked for vanity we should dislike\neveryone.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was her way. And just now she spoke to us both, as if she were\ndoing us a favor.\"\n\n\"Gracious, it's called,\" said he. \"What of it? It does us no harm and\ngives her about the only happiness she's got.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"At Josephine's right sat a handsome young foreigner.\"]\n\nNorman, without seeming to do so, noted the rest of the Burroughs party.\nAt Josephine's right sat a handsome young foreigner, and it took small\nexperience of the world to discover that he was paying court to her, and\nthat she was pleased and flattered. Norman asked the waiter who he was,\nand learned that he came from the waiter's own province of France, was\nthe Duc de Valdome. At first glance Norman had thought him\ndistinguished. Afterward he discriminated. There are several kinds or\ndegrees of distinction. There is distinction of race, of class, of\nfamily, of dress, of person. As Frenchman, as aristocrat, as a scion of\nthe ancient family of Valdome, as a specimen of tailoring and valeting,\nMiss Burroughs's young man was distinguished. But in his own proper\nperson he was rather insignificant. The others at the table were\nAmericans. Following Miss Burroughs's cue, they sought an opportunity to\nspeak friendlily to Norman--and he gave it them. His acknowledgment of\nthose effusive salutations was polite but restrained.\n\n\"They are friends of yours?\" said Dorothy.\n\n\"They were,\" said he. \"And they may be again--when they are friends of\n_ours_.\"\n\n\"I'm not very good at making friends,\" she warned him. \"I don't like\nmany people.\" This time her unconscious and profound egotism pleased\nhim. Evidently it did not occur to her that she should be eager to be\nfriends with those people on any terms, that the only question was\nwhether they would receive her.\n\nShe asked: \"Why was Miss--Miss Burroughs so friendly?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she be?\"\n\n\"But I thought you threw her over.\"\n\nHe winced at this crude way of putting it. \"On the contrary, she threw\nme over.\"\n\nDorothy laughed incredulously. \"I know better. Mr. Tetlow told me.\"\n\n\"She threw me over,\" repeated he coldly. \"Tetlow was repeating malicious\nand ignorant gossip.\"\n\nDorothy laughed again--it was her second glass of champagne. \"You say\nthat because it's the honorable thing to say. But I know.\"\n\n\"I say it because it's true,\" said he.\n\nHe spoke quietly, but if she had drunk many more than two glasses of an\nunaccustomed and heady liquor she would have felt his intonation. She\npaled and shrank and her slim white fingers fluttered nervously at the\ncollar of her dress. \"I was only joking,\" she murmured.\n\nHe laughed good-naturedly. \"Don't look as if I had given you a\nwhipping,\" said he. \"Surely you're not afraid of me.\"\n\nShe glanced shyly at him, a smile dancing in her eyes and upon her lips.\n\"Yes,\" she said. And after a pause she added: \"I didn't used to be. But\nthat was because I didn't know you--or much of anything.\" The smile\nirradiated her whole face. \"You used to be afraid of me. But you aren't,\nany more.\"\n\n\"No,\" said he, looking straight at her. \"No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"I always told you you were mistaken in what you thought of me. I really\ndon't amount to much. A man as serious and as important as you are\ncouldn't--couldn't care about me.\"\n\n\"It's true you don't amount to much, as yet,\" said he. \"And if you never\ndo amount to much, you'd be no less than most women and most men. But\nI've an idea--at times--that you _could_ amount to something.\"\n\nHe saw that he had wounded her vanity, that her protestations of\nhumility were precisely what he had suspected. He laughed at her: \"I see\nyou thought I'd contradict you. But I can't afford to be so amiable now.\nAnd the first thing you've got to get rid of is the part of your vanity\nthat prevents you from growing. Vanity of belief in one's possibilities\nis fine. No one gets anywhere without it. But vanity of belief in one's\npresent perfection--no one but a god could afford that luxury.\"\n\nObserving her closely he was amused--and pleased--to note that she was\nstruggling to compose herself to endure his candors as a necessary part\nof the duties and obligations she had taken on herself when she gave up\nand returned to him.\n\n\"What _you_ thought of _me_ used to be the important thing in our\nrelations,\" he went on, in his way of raillery that took all or nearly\nall the sting out of what he said, but none of its strength. \"Now, the\nimportant thing is what I think of you. You are much younger than I,\nespecially in experience. You are going to school to life with me as\nteacher. You'll dislike the teacher for the severity of the school. That\nisn't just, but it's natural--perhaps inevitable. And please--my dear--when\nyou are bitterest over what _you_ have to put up with from _me_--don't\nforget what _I_ have to put up with from _you_.\"\n\nShe was fighting bravely against angry tears. As for him, he had\nsuddenly become indifferent to what the people around them might be\nthinking. With all his old arrogance come back in full flood, he was\nfeeling that he would live his own life in his own way and that those\nwho didn't approve--yes, including Dorothy--might do as they saw fit.\nShe said:\n\n\"I don't blame you for regretting that you didn't marry Miss Burroughs.\"\n\n\"But I don't regret it,\" replied he. \"On the contrary, I'm glad.\"\n\nShe glanced hopefully at him. But the hopeful expression faded as he\nwent on:\n\n\"Whether or not I made a mistake in marrying you, I certainly had an\nescape from disaster when she decided she preferred a foreigner and a\ntitle. There's a good sensible reason why so many girls of her\nclass--more and more all the time--marry abroad. They are not fit to be\nthe wives of hard-working American husbands. In fact I've about reached\nthe conclusion that of the girls growing up nowdays very few in any\nclass are fit to be American wives. They're not big enough. They're too\ncoarse and crude in their tastes. They're only fit for the shallow,\nshowy sort of thing--and the European aristocracy is their hope--and\ntheir place.\"\n\nHer small face had a fascinating expression of a\nchild trying to understand things far beyond its depth. He was\ninterested in his own thoughts, however, and went on--for, if he had\nbeen in the habit of stopping when his hearers failed to understand, or\nwhen they misunderstood, either he would have been silent most of the\ntime in company or his conversation would have been as petty and narrow\nand devoid of originality or imagination as is the mentality of most\nhuman beings--as is the talk and reading that impress them as\ninteresting--and profound!\n\n\"The American man of the more ambitious sort,\" he went on, \"either has\nto live practically if not physically apart from his wife or else has to\neducate some not too difficult woman to be his wife.\"\n\nShe understood that. \"You are really going to educate me?\" she said,\nwith an arch smile. Now that Norman had her attention, now that she was\ncentering upon him instead of upon herself, she was interested in him,\nand in what he said, whether she understood it or not, whether it\npleased her vanity or wounded it. The intellects of women work to an\nunsuspected extent only through the sex charm. Their appreciations of\nbooks, of art, of men are dependant, often in the most curious indirect\nways, upon the fact that the author, the artist, the politician or what\nnot is betrousered. Thus, Dorothy was patient, respectful, attentive,\nwas not offended by Norman's didactic way of giving her the lessons in\nlife. Her smile was happy as well as coquettish, as she asked him to\neducate her.\n\nHe returned her smile. \"That depends,\" answered he.\n\n\"You're not sure I'm worth the trouble?\"\n\n\"You may put it that way, if you like. But I'd say, rather, I'm not sure\nI can spare the time--and you're not sure you care to fit yourself for\nthe place.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I do!\" cried she.\n\n\"We'll see--in a few weeks or months,\" replied he.\n\nThe Burroughs party were rising. Josephine had choice of two ways to the\ndoor. She chose the one that took her past Norman and his bride. She\nadvanced, beaming. Norman rose, took her extended hand. Said she:\n\n\"So glad to see you.\" Then, turning the radiant smile upon Dorothy, \"And\nis this your wife? Is this the pretty little typewriter girl?\"\n\nDorothy nodded--a charming, ingenuous bend of the head. Norman felt a\nthrill of pride in her, so beautifully unconscious of the treacherous\nattempt at insult. It particularly delighted him that she had not made\nthe mistake of rising to return Josephine's greeting but had remained\nseated. Surely this wife of his had the right instincts that never fail\nto cause right manners. For Josephine's benefit, he gazed down at\nDorothy with the proudest, fondest eyes. \"Yes--this is she,\" said he.\n\"Can you blame me?\"\n\nJosephine paled and winced visibly, as if the blow she had aimed at him\nhad, after glancing off harmlessly, returned to crush her. She touched\nDorothy's proffered hand, murmured a few stammering phrases of vague\ncompliment, rejoined her friends. Said Dorothy, when she and Norman were\nsettled again:\n\n\"I shall never like her. Nor she me.\"\n\n\"But you do like this cheese? Waiter, another bottle of that same.\"\n\n\"Why did she put you in such a good humor?\" inquired his wife.\n\n\"It wasn't she. It was you!\" replied he. But he refused to explain.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nGalloway accepted Norman's terms. He would probably have accepted terms\nfar less easy. But Norman as yet knew with the thoroughness which must\nprecede intelligent plan and action only the legal side of financial\noperations; he had been as indifferent to the commercial side as a pilot\nto the value of the cargo in the ship he engages to steer clear of\nshoals and rocks. So with the prudence of the sagacious man's audacities\nhe contented himself with a share of this first venture that would\nsimply make a comfortable foundation for the fortune he purposed to\nbuild. As the venture could not fail outright, even should Galloway die,\nhe rented a largish place at Hempstead, with the privilege of purchase,\nand installed his wife and himself with a dozen servants and a\nhousekeeper.\n\n\"This housekeeper, this Mrs. Lowell,\" said he to Dorothy, \"is a good\nenough person as housekeepers go. But you will have to look sharply\nafter her.\"\n\nDorothy seemed to fade and shrink within herself, which was her way of\nconfessing lack of courage and fitness to face a situation: \"I don't\nknow anything about those things,\" she confessed.\n\n\"I understand perfectly,\" said he. \"But you learned something at the\nplace in Jersey City--quite enough for the start. Really, all you need\nto know just now is whether the place is clean or not, and whether the\nfood comes on the table in proper condition. The rest you'll pick up\ngradually.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said she, looking doubtful and helpless; these new\nmagnitudes were appalling, especially now that she was beginning to get\na point of view upon life.\n\n\"At any rate, don't bother me for these few next months,\" said he. \"I'm\ngoing to be very busy--shall leave early in the morning and not be back\nuntil near dinner time--if I come at all. No, you'll not be annoyed by\nme. You'll be absolute mistress of your time.\"\n\nShe tried to look as if this contented her. But he could not have failed\nto see how dissatisfied and disquieted she really was. He had the best\nof reasons for thinking that she was living under the same roof with him\nonly because she preferred the roof he could provide to such a one as\nshe could provide for herself whether by her own earnings or by marrying\na man more to her liking personally. Yet here she was, piqued and\ndepressed because of his indifference--because he was not thrusting upon\nher gallantries she would tolerate only through prudence!\n\n\"You will be lonely at times, I'm afraid,\" said he. \"But I can't provide\nfriends or even acquaintances for you for several months--until my\naffairs are in better order and my sister and her husband come back from\nEurope.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shan't be lonely,\" cried she. \"I've never cared for people.\"\n\n\"You've your books, and your music--and riding--and shopping trips to\ntown--and the house and grounds to look after.\"\n\n\"Yes--and my dreams,\" said she hopefully, her eyes suggesting the dusky\nstar depths.\n\n\"Oh--the dreams. You'll have little time for them,\" said he drily. \"And\nlittle inclination, I imagine, as you wake up to the sense of how much\nthere is to be learned. Dreaming is the pastime of people who haven't\nthe intelligence or the energy to accomplish anything. If you wish to\nplease me--and you do--don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured. She forced her rebellious lips to the laconic\nassent. She drooped the lids over her rebellious eyes, lest he should\ndetect her wounded feelings and her resentment.\n\n\"I assumed so,\" said he, with a secret smile. \"Well, if you wish to\nplease me, you'll give your time to practical things--things that'll\nmake you more interesting and make us both more comfortable. It was all\nvery well to dream, while you had little to do and small opportunity.\nBut now--Try to cut it out.\"\n\nIt is painful to an American girl of any class to find that she has to\nearn her position as wife. The current theory, a tradition from an early\nand woman-revering day, is that the girl has done her share and more\nwhen she has consented to the suit of the ardent male and has intrusted\nher priceless charms to his exclusive keeping. According to that same\ntheory, it is the husband who must earn his position--must continue to\nearn it. He is a humble creature, honored by the presence of a wonderful\nbeing, a cross between a queen and a goddess. He cannot do enough to\nshow his gratitude. Perhaps--but only perhaps--had Norman married\nJosephine Burroughs, he might have assented, after a fashion, to this\nidea of the relations of the man and the woman. No doubt, had he\nremained under the spell of Dorothy's mystery and beauty, he would have\nfelt and acted the slave he had made of himself at the outset. But in\nthe circumstances he was looking at their prospective life together with\nsane eyes. And so she had, in addition to all her other reasons for\nheartache, a sense that she, the goddess-queen, the American woman, with\nthe birthright of dominion over the male, was being cheated, humbled,\ndegraded.\n\nAt first he saw that this sense of being wronged made it impossible for\nher to do anything at all toward educating herself for her position. But\ntime brought about the change he had hoped for. A few weeks, and she\nbegan to cheer up, almost in spite of herself. What was the use in\nsulking or sighing or in self-pitying, when it brought only unhappiness\nto oneself? The coarse and brutal male in the case was either unaware or\nindifferent. There was no one and no place to fly to--unless she wished\nto be much worse off than her darkest mood of self-pity represented her\nto her sorrowing self. The housekeeper, Mrs. Lowell, was a \"broken down\ngentlewoman\" who had been chastened by misfortune into a wholesome state\nof practical good sense about the relative values of the real and the\nromantic. Mrs. Lowell diagnosed the case of the young wife--as Norman\nhad shrewdly guessed she would--and was soon adroitly showing her the\nmany advantages of her lot. Before they had been three months at\nHempstead, Dorothy had discovered that she, in fact, was without a\nsingle ground for serious complaint. She had a husband who was generous\nabout money, and left her as absolutely alone as if he were mere\noccasional visitor at the house. She had her living--and such a\nliving!--she had plenty of interesting occupation--she had not a single\nsordid care--and perfect health.\n\nThe dreams, too--It was curious about those dreams. She would now have\nfound it an intolerable bore to sit with hands idle in her lap and eyes\nupon vacancy, watching the dim, luminous shadows flit aimlessly by. Yet\nthat was the way she used to pass hours--entire days. She used to fight\noff sleep at night the longer to enjoy her one source of pure happiness.\nThere was no doubt about it, the fire of romance was burning low, and\nshe was becoming commonplace, practical, resigned. Well, why not? Was\nnot life over for her?--that is, the life a girl's fancy longs for. In\nplace of hope of romance, there was an uneasy feeling of a necessity of\npleasing this husband of hers--of making him comfortable. What would\nbefall her if she neglected trying to please him or if she, for all her\ntrying, failed? She did not look far in that direction. Her uneasiness\nremained indefinite--yet definite enough to keep her working from waking\nuntil bedtime. And she dropped into the habit of watching his face with\nthe same anxiety with which a farmer watches the weather. When he\nhappened one day to make a careless, absent-minded remark in disapproval\nof something in the domestic arrangements, she was thrown into such a\nnervous flutter that he observed it.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing,\" replied she in the hurried tone of one who is trying\nhastily to cover his thoughts.\n\nHe reflected, understood, burst into a fit of hearty laughter. \"So, you\nare trying to make a bogey of me?\"\n\nShe colored, protested faintly.\n\n\"Don't you know I'm about the least tyrannical, least exacting person in\nthe world?\"\n\n\"You've been very patient with me,\" said she.\n\n\"Now--now,\" cried he in a tone of raillery, \"you might as well drop\nthat. Don't you know there's no reason for being afraid of me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I _know_ it,\" replied she. \"But I _feel_ afraid, just the same. I\ncan't help it.\"\n\nIt was impossible for him to appreciate the effect of his personality\nupon others--how, without his trying or even wishing, it made them dread\na purely imaginary displeasure and its absurdly imaginary consequences.\nBut this confession of hers was not the first time he had heard of the\neffect of potential and latent danger he had upon those associated with\nhim. And, as it was most useful, he was not sorry that he had it. He\nmade no further attempt to convince her that he was harmless. He knew\nthat he was harmless where she was concerned. Was it not just as well\nthat she should not know it, when vaguely dreading him was producing\nexcellent results? As with a Christian the fear of the Lord was the\nbeginning of wisdom, so with a wife the fear of her husband was the\nbeginning of wisdom. In striving to please him, to fit herself for the\nposition of wife, she was using up the time she would otherwise have\nspent in making herself miserable with self-pity--that supreme curse of\nthe idle both male and female, that most prolific of the breeders of\nunhappy wives. Yes, wives were unhappy not because their husbands\nneglected them, for busy people have no time to note whether they are\nneglected or not, but because they gave their own worthless, negligent,\nincapable selves too much attention.\n\nOne evening, she, wearing the look of the timid but resolute intruder,\ncame into his room while he was dressing for dinner and hung about with\nan air no man of his experience could fail to understand.\n\n\"Something wrong about the house?\" said he finally. \"Need more money?\"\n\n\"No--nothing,\" she replied, with a slight flush. He saw that she was\nmustering all her courage for some grand effort. He waited, only mildly\ncurious, as his mind was busy with some new business he and Tetlow had\nundertaken. Presently she stood squarely before him, her hands behind\nher back and her face upturned. \"Won't you kiss me?\" she said.\n\n\"Sure!\" said he. And he kissed her on the cheek and resumed operations\nwith his military brushes.\n\n\"I didn't mean that--that kind of a kiss,\" said she dejectedly.\n\nHe paused with a quick characteristic turn of the head, looked keenly at\nher, resumed his brushing. A quizzical smile played over his face. \"Oh,\nI see,\" said he. \"You've been thinking about duty. And you've decided to\ndo yours. . . . Eh?\"\n\n\"I think--It seems to me--I don't think--\" she stammered, then said\ndesperately, \"I've not been acting right by you. I want to--to do\nbetter.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said he briskly, with a nod of approval--and never a\nglance in her direction. \"You think you'll let me have a kiss now and\nthen--eh? All right, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, you _won't_ understand me!\" she cried, ready to weep with vexation.\n\n\"You mean I won't misunderstand you,\" replied he amiably, as he set\nabout fixing his tie. \"You've been mulling things over in your mind.\nYou've decided I'm secretly pining for you. You've resolved to be good\nand kind and dutiful--generous--to feed old dog Tray a few crumbs now\nand then. . . . That's nice and sweet of you--\" He paused until the\ncrisis in tying was passed--\"very nice and sweet of you--but--There's\nnothing in it. All I ask of you for myself is to see that I'm\ncomfortable--that Mrs. Lowell and the servants treat me right. If I\ndon't like anything, I'll speak out--never fear.\"\n\n\"But--Fred--I want to be your wife--I really do,\" she pleaded.\n\nHe turned on her, and his eyes seemed to pierce into the chamber of her\nthoughts. \"Drop it, my dear,\" he said quietly. \"Neither of us is in love\nwith the other. So there's not the slightest reason for pretending. If I\never want to be free of you, I'll tell you so. If you ever want to get\nrid of me, all you have to do is to ask--and it'll be arranged.\nMeanwhile, let's enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nHis good humor, obviously unfeigned, would have completely discouraged a\nmore experienced woman, though as vain as Dorothy and with as much\nground as he had given her for self-confidence where he was concerned.\nBut Dorothy was depressed rather than profoundly discouraged. A few\nmoments and she found courage to plead: \"But you used to care for me.\nDon't I attract you any more?\"\n\n\"You say that quite pathetically,\" said he, in good-humored amusement.\n\"I'm willing to do anything within reason for your happiness. But\nreally--just to please your vanity I can't make myself over again into\nthe fool I used to be about you. You'd hate it yourself. Why, then, this\npathetic air?\"\n\n\"I feel so useless--and as if I were shirking,\" she persisted. \"And if\nyou did care for me, it wouldn't offend me now as it used to. I've grown\nmuch wiser--more sensible. I understand things--and I look at them\ndifferently. And--I always did _like_ you.\"\n\n\"Even when you despised me?\" mocked he. It irritated him a little\nvividly to recall what a consummate fool he had made of himself for her,\neven though he had every reason to be content with the event of his\nfolly.\n\n\"A girl always thinks she despises a man when she can do as she pleases\nwith him,\" replied she. \"As Mr. Tetlow said, I was a fool.\"\n\n\"_I_ was the fool,\" said he. \"Where did that man of mine lay the\nhandkerchief?\"\n\n\"I, too,\" cried she, eagerly. \"You were foolish to bother about a little\nsilly like me. But, oh, what a _fool_ I was not to realize----\"\n\n\"You're not trying to tell me you're in love with me?\" said he sharply.\n\n\"Oh, no--no, indeed,\" she protested in haste, alarmed by his\noverwhelming manner. \"I'm not trying to deceive you in any way.\"\n\n\"Never do,\" said he. \"It's the one thing I can't stand.\"\n\n\"But I thought--it seemed to me--\" she persisted, \"that perhaps if we\ntried to--to care for each other, we'd maybe get to--to caring--more or\nless. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" was his careless reply. He added, \"But I, for one, am well\ncontent with things as they are. I confess I don't look back with any\nsatisfaction on those months when I was making an ass of myself about\nyou. I was ruining my career. Now I'm happy, and everything is going\nfine in my business. No experiments, if you please.\" He shook his head,\nlooking at her with smiling raillery. \"It might turn out that I'd care\nfor you in the same crazy way again, and that you didn't like it. Again\nyou might get excited about me and I'd remain calm about you. That would\ngive me a handsome revenge, but I'm not looking for revenge.\"\n\nHe finished his toilet, she standing quiet and thoughtful in an attitude\nof unconscious grace.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" resumed he, as he prepared to descend for dinner, \"let's\nhave a peaceful, cheerful married life, with no crazy excitements.\nLet's hang on to what we've got, and take no unnecessary risks.\" He\npatted her on the shoulder. \"Isn't that sensible?\"\n\nShe looked at him with serious, appealing eyes. \"You are _sure_ you aren't\nunhappy?\"\n\nIt was amusing to him--though he concealed it--to see how tenaciously\nher feminine egotism held to the idea that she was the important person.\nAnd, when women of experience thus deluded themselves, it was not at all\nstrange that this girl should be unable to grasp the essential truth as\nto the relations of men and women--that, while a woman who makes her sex\nher profession must give to a man, to some man, a dominant place in her\nlife, a man need give a woman--at least, any one woman--little or no\nplace. But he would not wantonly wound her harmless vanity. \"Don't worry\nabout me, please,\" said he in the kindest, friendliest way. \"I am\ntelling you the truth.\"\n\nAnd they descended to the dining room. Usually he was preoccupied and\nshe did most of the talking--not a difficult matter for her, as she was\none of those who by nature have much to say, who talk on and on, giving\nlively, pleasant recitals of commonplace daily happenings. That evening\nit was her turn to be abstracted, or, at least, silent. He talked\nvolubly, torrentially, like a man of teeming mind in the highest\nspirits. And he was in high spirits. The Galloway enterprise had\ndeveloped into a huge success; also, it did not lessen his sense of the\npleasantness of life to have learned that his wife was feeling about as\nwell disposed toward him as he cared to have her feel, had come round to\nthat state of mind which he, as a practical man, wise in the art of\nlife, regarded as ideal for a wife.\n\nA successful man, with a quiet and comfortable home, well enough looked\nafter by an agreeable wife, exceeding good to look at and interested\nonly in her home and her husband--what more could a man ask?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat more could a man ask? Only one thing more--a baby. The months soon\npassed and that rounding out of the home side of his life was\nconsummated with no mishap. The baby was a girl, which contented him and\ndelighted Dorothy. He wished it to be named after her, she preferred his\nsister's name--Ursula. It was Ursula who decided the question. \"She\nlooks like you, Fred,\" she declared, after an earnest scanning of the\nweird little face. \"Why not call her Frederica?\"\n\nNorman thought this clumsy, but Dorothy instantly assented--and the baby\nwas duly christened Frederica.\n\nPerhaps it was because he was having less pressing business in town, but\nwhatever the reason, he began to stay at home more--surprisingly more.\nAnd, being at home, he naturally fell into the habit of fussing with the\nbaby, he having the temperament that compels a man to be always at\nsomething, and the baby being convenient and in the nature of a\ncuriosity. Ursula, who was stopping in the house, did not try to conceal\nher amazement at this extraordinary development of her brother's\ncharacter.\n\nSaid she: \"I never before knew you to take the slightest interest in a\nchild.\"\n\nSaid he: \"I never before saw a child worth taking the slightest interest\nin.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Ursula, \"it won't last. You'll soon grow tired of your\nplaything.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" said Norman. \"I hope you're wrong.\" He\nreflected, added: \"In fact, I'm almost certain you're wrong. I'm too\nselfish to let myself lose such a pleasure. If you had observed my life\nclosely, you'd have discovered that I have never given up a single thing\nI found a source of pleasure. That is good sense. That is why the\nsuperior sort of men and women retain something of the boy and the girl\nall their lives. I still like a lot of the games I played as a boy. For\nsome years I've had no chance to indulge in them. I'll be glad when Rica\nis old enough to give me the chance again.\"\n\nShe was much amused. \"Who'd have suspected that _you_ were a born father!\"\n\n\"Not I, for one,\" confessed he. \"We never know what there is in us until\ncircumstances bring it out.\"\n\n\"A devoted father and a doting husband,\" pursued Ursula. \"I must say I\nrather sympathize with you as a doting husband. Of course, I, a woman,\ncan't see her as you do. I can't imagine a man--especially a man of your\nsort--going stark mad about a mere woman. But, as women go, I'll admit\nshe is a good specimen. Not the marvel of intelligence and complex\ncharacter you imagine, but still a good specimen. And physically--\" She\nlaughed--\"_That's_ what caught you. That's what holds you--and will hold\nyou as long as it lasts.\"\n\n\"Was there ever a woman who didn't think that?--and didn't like to\nthink it, though I believe many of them make strong pretense at scorning\nthe physical.\" Fred was regarding his sister with a quizzical\nexpression. \"You approve of her?\" he said.\n\n\"More than I'd have thought possible. And after I've taken her about in\nthe world a while she'll be perfect.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Norman. \"But, alas, she'll never be perfect. For,\nyou're not going to take her about.\"\n\n\"So she says when I talk of it to her,\" replied Ursula. \"But I know\nyou'll insist. You needn't be uneasy as to how she'll be received.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said Norman dryly.\n\n\"You've got back all you lost--and more. How we Americans do worship\nsuccess!\"\n\n\"Don't suggest to Dorothy anything further about society,\" said Norman.\n\"I've no time or taste for it, and I don't wish to be annoyed by\nintrusions into my home.\"\n\n\"But you'll not be satisfied always with just her,\" urged his sister.\n\"Besides, you've got a position to maintain.\"\n\nNorman's smile was cynically patient. \"I want my home and I want my\ncareer,\" said he. \"And I don't want any society nonsense. I had the good\nluck to marry a woman who knows and cares nothing about it. I don't\npurpose to give up the greatest advantage of my marriage.\"\n\nUrsula was astounded. She knew the meaning of his various tones and\nmanners, and his way of rejecting her plans for Dorothy--and,\nincidentally, for her own amusement--convinced her that he was through\nand through in earnest. \"It will be dreadfully lonesome for her, Fred,\"\nshe pleaded.\n\n\"We'll wait till that trouble faces us,\" replied he, not a bit\nimpressed. \"And don't forget--not a word of temptation to her from you.\"\nThis with an expression that warned her how well he knew her indirect\nways of accomplishing what she could not gain directly.\n\n\"Oh, I shan't interfere,\" said she in a tone that made it a binding\npromise. \"But you can't expect me to sympathize with your plans for an\nold-fashioned domestic life.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Norman. \"You don't understand. Women of your sort\nnever do. That's why you're not fit to be the wives of men worth while.\nA serious man and a society woman can't possibly hit it off together.\nFor a serious man the outside world is a place to work, and home is a\nplace to rest. For a society woman, the world is a place to idle and\nhome is a work shop, an entertainment factory. It's impossible to\nreconcile those two opposite ideas.\"\n\nShe saw his point at once, and it appealed to her intelligence. And she\nhad his own faculty for never permitting prejudice to influence\njudgment. She said in a dubious tone, \"Do you think Dorothy will\nsympathize with your scheme?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" replied he.\n\n\"If she doesn't--\" Ursula halted there.\n\nHer brother shrugged his shoulders. \"If she proves to be the wrong sort\nof woman for me, she'll go her way and I mine.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought you loved her!\"\n\n\"What have I said that leads you to change your mind?\" said he.\n\n\"A man does not take the high hand with the woman he adores.\"\n\n\"So?\" said Norman tranquilly.\n\n\"Well,\" said his puzzled sister by way of conclusion, \"if you persist in\nbeing the autocrat----\"\n\n\"Autocrat?--I?\" laughed he. \"Am I trying to compel her to do anything\nshe doesn't wish to do? Didn't I say she would be free to go if she were\ndissatisfied with me and my plan--if she didn't adopt it gladly as her\nown plan, also?\"\n\n\"But you know very well she's dependent upon you, Fred.\"\n\n\"Is that my fault? Does a man force a woman to become dependent? And\njust because she is dependent, should he therefore yield to her and let\nher make of his life a waste and a folly?\"\n\n\"You're far too clever for me to argue with. Anyhow, as I was saying, if\nyou persist in what I call tyranny----\"\n\n\"When a woman cries tyranny, it means she's furious because she is not\ngetting _her_ autocratic way.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" admitted Ursula cheerfully. \"At any rate, if you\npersist--unless she loves you utterly, your life will be miserable.\"\n\n\"She may make her own life miserable, but not mine,\" replied he. \"If I\nwere the ordinary man--counting himself lucky to have induced any woman\nto marry him--afraid if he lost his woman he'd not be able to get\nanother--able to give his woman only an indifferent poor support, and so\non--if I were one of those men, what you say might be true. But what\ndeep and permanent mischief can a frail woman do a strong man?\"\n\n\"There's instance after instance in history----\"\n\n\"Of strong men wrecking _themselves_ through various kinds of madness,\nincluding sex madness. But, my dear Ursula, not an instance--not\none--where the woman was responsible. If history were truth, instead of\nlies--you women might have less conceit.\"\n\n\"You--talking this way!\" mocked Ursula.\n\n\"Meaning, I suppose, my late infatuation?\" inquired he, unruffled.\n\n\"I never saw or read of a worse case.\"\n\n\"Am I ruined?\"\n\n\"No. But why not? Because you got her. If you hadn't--\" Ursula blew out\na large cloud of cigarette smoke with a \"Pouf!\"\n\n\"If I hadn't got her,\" said Norman, \"I'd have got well, just the same,\nin due time. A sick _weak_ man goes down; a sick _strong_ man gets well.\nWhen a man who's reputed to be strong doesn't get well, it's because he\nmerely seemed strong but wasn't. The poets and novelists and the\nhistorians and the rest of the nature fakers fail to tell _all_ the facts,\ndear sister. All the facts would spoil a pretty story.\"\n\nUrsula thought a few minutes, suddenly burst out with, \"Do you think\nDorothy loves you now?\"\n\nNorman rose to go out doors. \"I don't think about such unprofitable\nthings,\" said he. \"As long as we suit each other and get along\npleasantly--why bother about a name for it?\"\n\nIn the French window he paused, stood looking out with an expression so\npeculiar that Ursula, curious, came to see the cause. A few yards away,\nunder a big symmetrical maple in full leaf sat Dorothy with the baby on\nher lap. She was dressed very simply in white. There was a little\nsunlight upon her hair, a sheen of gold over her skin. She was looking\ndown at the baby. Her expression----\n\nSaid Ursula: \"Several of the great painters have tried to catch that\nexpression. But they've failed.\"\n\nNorman made no reply. He had not heard. All in an instant there had been\nrevealed to him a whole new world--a view of man and woman--of woman--of\nsex--its meaning so different from what he had believed and lived.\n\n\"What're you thinking about, Fred?\" inquired his sister.\n\nHe shook his head, with a mysterious smile, and strolled away.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nThe baby grew and thrived, as the habit is with healthy children well\ntaken care of. Mrs. Norman soon got back her strength, her figure, and\nperhaps more than her former beauty--as the habit is with healthy women\nwell taken care of. Norman's career continued to prosper, likewise\naccording to the habit of all healthy things well taken care of. In a\nworld where nothing happens by chance, mischance, to be serious, must\nhave some grave fault as its hidden cause. We mortals, who love to live\nat haphazard and to blame God or destiny or \"bad luck\" for our\ncalamities, hate to take this modern and scientific view of the world\nand life. But, whether we like it or not, it is the truth--and, as we\ncan't get round it, why not accept it cheerfully and, so appear a little\nless ignorant and ridiculous?\n\nDuring their first year at the Hempstead place the results in luxury and\ncomfort had at no time accounted for the money it cost and the servants\nit employed--that is to say, paid. But Norman was neither unreasonable\nnor impatient. Also, in his years of experience with his sister's\nhousekeeping, and of observation of the other women, he had grown\nexceedingly moderate in his estimate of the ability of women and in his\nexpectations from them. He had reached the conclusion that the women who\nwere sheltered and pampered by the men of the successful classes were\nproficient only in those things that call for no skill or effort beyond\nthe wagging of the tongue. He saw that Dorothy was making honest\nendeavor to learn her business, and he knew that learning takes\ntime--much time.\n\nHe believed that in the end she would do better than any other wife of\nhis acquaintance, at the business of wife and mother.\n\nBefore the baby was two years old, his belief was rewarded. Things began\nto run better--began to run well, even. Dorothy--a serious person,\nunhampered of a keen sense of humor, had taught herself the duties of\nher new position in much the same slow plodding way in which she had\nformerly made of herself a fair stenographer and a tolerable typewriter.\nMrs. Lowell had helped--and Ursula, too--and Norman not a little. But\nDorothy, her husband discovered, was one of those who thoroughly\nassimilate what they take in--who make it over into part of themselves.\nSo, her manner of keeping house, of arranging the gardens, of bringing\nup the baby, of dressing herself, was peculiarly her own. It was not by\nany means the best imaginable way. It was even what many energetic,\nsystematic and highly competent persons would speak contemptuously of.\nBut it satisfied Norman--and that was all Dorothy had in mind.\n\nIf those who have had any considerable opportunity to observe married\nlife will forget what they have read in novels and will fix their minds\non what they have observed at first hand, they will recognize the Norman\nmarriage, with the husband and wife living together yet apart as not\npeculiar but of a rather common type. Neither Fred nor Dorothy had any\nespecial reason on any given day to try to alter their relations; so the\nlaw of inertia asserted itself and matters continued as they had begun.\nIt was, perhaps, a chance remark of Tetlow's that was the remote but\nefficient cause of a change, as the single small stone slipping high up\non the mountain side results in a vast landslide into the valley miles\nbelow. Tetlow said one day, in connection with some estate they were\nsettling:\n\n\"I've always pitied the only child. It must be miserably lonesome.\"\n\nNo sooner were the words out of his mouth than he colored violently;\nfor, he remembered that the Normans had but one child and he knew the\nprobable reason for it. Norman seemed not to have heard or seen. Tetlow\nhoped he hadn't, but, knowing the man, feared otherwise. And he was\nright.\n\nIn the press of other matters Norman forgot Tetlow's remark--remembered\nit again a few days later when he was taking the baby out for an airing\nin the motor--forgot it again--finally, when he took a several days'\nrest at home, remembered it and kept it in mind. He began to think of\nDorothy once more in a definite, personal way, began to observe her as\nhis wife, instead of as mere part of his establishment. An intellectual\nperson she certainly was not. She had a quaint individual way of\nspeaking and of acting. She had the marvelous changeable beauty that had\nonce caused him to take the bit in his teeth and run wild. But he would\nno more think of talking with her about the affairs that really\ninterested him than--well, than the other men of large career in his\nacquaintance would think of talking those matters to their wives.\n\nBut--He was astonished to discover that he liked this slim, quiet,\nunobtrusive little wife of his better than he liked anyone else in the\nworld, that he eagerly turned away from the clever and amusing\ncompanionship he might have at his clubs to come down to the country and\nbe with her and the baby--not the baby alone, but her also. Why? He\ncould not find a satisfactory reason. He saw that she created at that\nHempstead place an atmosphere of rest, of tranquility. But this merely\nthrust the mystery one step back. _How_ did she create this\natmosphere--and for a man of his varied and discriminating tastes? To\nthat question he could work out no answer. She had for him now a charm\nas different from the infatuation of former days as calm sea is from\ntempest-racked sea--utterly different, yet fully as potent. As he\nobserved her and wondered at these discoveries of his, the ghost of a\ndelight he had thought forever dead stirred in his heart, in his fancy.\nYes, it was a pleasure, a thrilling pleasure to watch her. There was\nmusic in those quiet, graceful movements of hers, in that quiet, sweet\nvoice. Not the wild, blood-heating music of the former days, but a kind\nfar more melodious--tender, restful to nerves sorely tried by the\ntensions of ambition. He made some sort of an attempt to define his\nfeeling for her, but could not. It seemed to fit into none of the usual\nclassifications.\n\nThen, he wondered--\"What is _she_ thinking of _me_?\"\n\nTo find out he resorted to various elaborate round about methods that\ndid credit to the ingenuity of his mind. But he made at every cunning\ncast a barren water-haul. Either she was not thinking of him at all or\nwhat she thought swam too deep for any casts he knew how to make in\nthose hidden and unfamiliar waters. Or, perhaps she did not herself know\nwhat she thought, being too busy with the baby and the household to have\ntime for such abstract and not pressing, perhaps not important, matters.\nHe moved slowly in his inquiries into her state of mind because there\nwas all the time in the world and no occasion for haste. He moved\ncautiously because he wished to do nothing that might disturb the\npresent serenity of their home life. Did she dislike him? Was she\nindifferent? Had she developed a habit of having him about that was in a\nway equivalent to liking?\n\nThese languid but delightful investigations--not unlike the pastimes one\nspins out when one has a long, long lovely summer day with hours on\nhours for luxurious happy idling--these investigations were abruptly\nsuspended by a suddenly compelled trip to Europe. He arranged for\nDorothy to send him a cable every day--\"about yourself and the\nbaby\"--and he sent an occasional cabled bulletin about himself in reply.\nBut neither wrote to the other; their relationship was not of the\nletter-exchanging kind--and had no need of pretense at what it was not.\n\nIn the third month of his absence, his sister Ursula came over for\ndresses, millinery and truly aristocratic society. She had little time\nfor him, or he for her, but they happened to lunch alone about a week\nafter his arrival.\n\n\"You're looking cross and unhappy,\" said she. \"What's the matter?\nBusiness?\"\n\n\"No--everything's going well.\"\n\n\"Same thing that's troubling Dorothy, then?\"\n\n\"Is Dorothy ill?\" inquired he, suddenly as alert as he had been absent.\n\"She hasn't let me know anything about it.\"\n\n\"Ill? Of course not,\" reassured Ursula. \"She's never ill. But--I've not\nanywhere or ever seen two people as crazy about each other as you and\nshe.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Norman had relapsed into interest in what he was eating.\n\n\"You live all alone down there in the country. You treat anyone who\ncomes to see you as intruder. And as soon as darling husband goes away,\ndarling wife wanders about like a damned soul. Honestly, it gave me the\nblues to look at her eyes. And I used to think she cared more about the\nbaby than about you.\"\n\n\"She's probably worried about something else,\" said Norman. \"More salad?\nNo? There's no dessert--at least I've ordered none. But if you'd like\nsome strawberries----\"\n\n\"I thought of that,\" replied Ursula, not to be deflected. \"I mean of her\nbeing upset about something beside you. I'm slow to suspect anyone of\nreally caring about any _one_ else. But, although she didn't confess, I\nsoon saw that it was your absence. And she wasn't putting on for my\nbenefit, either. My maid hears the same thing from all the servants.\"\n\n\"This is pleasant,\" said Norman in his mocking good-humored way.\n\n\"And you're in the same state,\" she charged with laughing but\nsympathetic eyes. \"Why, Fred, you're as madly in love with her as ever.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said he reflectively.\n\n\"Why didn't you bring her with you?\"\n\nHe stared at his sister like a man who has just discovered that he, with\nincredible stupidity, had overlooked the obvious. \"I didn't think I'd\nbe away long,\" evaded he.\n\nHe saw Ursula off for the Continent, half promised to join her in a few\nweeks at Aix. A day or so after her departure he had a violent fit of\nblues, was haunted by a vision of the baby and the comfortable, peaceful\nhouse on Long Island. He had expected to stay about two months longer.\n\"I'm sick of England and of hotels,\" he said, and closed up his business\nand sailed the following week.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe and the baby were at the pier to meet him. He looked for signs of\nthe mourning Ursula had described, but he looked in vain. Never had he\nseen her lovelier, or so sparkling. And how she did talk!--rattling on\nand on, with those interesting commonplaces of domestic event--the baby,\nthe household, the garden, the baby--the horses, the dogs, the\nbaby--the servants, her new dresses, the baby--and so on, and so on--and\nthe baby.\n\nBut when they got into the motor at Hempstead station for the drive\nhome, silence fell upon her--he had been almost silent from the start of\nthe little journey. As the motor swung into the grounds, looking their\nmost beautiful for his homecoming, an enormous wave of pure delight\nbegan to surge up in him, to swell, to rush, to break, dashing its spray\nof tears into his eyes. He turned his head away to hide the too obvious\ndisplay of feeling. They went into the house, he carrying the baby. He\ngave it to the nurse--and he and she were alone.\n\n\"It certainly is good to be home again,\" he said.\n\nThe words were the tamest commonplace. We always speak in the old\nstereotyped commonplaces when we speak directly from the heart. His tone\nmade her glance quickly at him.\n\n\"Why, I believe you _are_ glad,\" said she.\n\nHe took her hand. They looked at each other. Suddenly she flung herself\nwildly into his arms and clung to him in an agony of joy and fear. \"Oh,\nI missed you so!\" she sobbed. \"I missed you so!\"\n\n\"It was frightful,\" said he. \"It shall never happen again.\""
