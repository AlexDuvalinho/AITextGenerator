[1]\n     --Prior.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO IVANHOE.\n\n\nThe Author of the Waverley Novels had hitherto proceeded in an unabated\ncourse of popularity, and might, in his peculiar district of literature,\nhave been termed “L'Enfant Gate” of success. It was plain, however, that\nfrequent publication must finally wear out the public favour, unless\nsome mode could be devised to give an appearance of novelty to\nsubsequent productions. Scottish manners, Scottish dialect, and\nScottish characters of note, being those with which the author was most\nintimately, and familiarly acquainted, were the groundwork upon which he\nhad hitherto relied for giving effect to his narrative. It was, however,\nobvious, that this kind of interest must in the end occasion a degree of\nsameness and repetition, if exclusively resorted to, and that the reader\nwas likely at length to adopt the language of Edwin, in Parnell's Tale:\n\n“'Reverse the spell,' he cries, 'And let it fairly now suffice. The\ngambol has been shown.'”\n\nNothing can be more dangerous for the fame of a professor of the fine\narts, than to permit (if he can possibly prevent it) the character of a\nmannerist to be attached to him, or that he should be supposed capable\nof success only in a particular and limited style. The public are, in\ngeneral, very ready to adopt the opinion, that he who has pleased them\nin one peculiar mode of composition, is, by means of that very talent,\nrendered incapable of venturing upon other subjects. The effect of this\ndisinclination, on the part of the public, towards the artificers of\ntheir pleasures, when they attempt to enlarge their means of amusing,\nmay be seen in the censures usually passed by vulgar criticism upon\nactors or artists who venture to change the character of their efforts,\nthat, in so doing, they may enlarge the scale of their art.\n\nThere is some justice in this opinion, as there always is in such as\nattain general currency. It may often happen on the stage, that an\nactor, by possessing in a preeminent degree the external qualities\nnecessary to give effect to comedy, may be deprived of the right to\naspire to tragic excellence; and in painting or literary composition, an\nartist or poet may be master exclusively of modes of thought, and powers\nof expression, which confine him to a single course of subjects. But\nmuch more frequently the same capacity which carries a man to popularity\nin one department will obtain for him success in another, and that must\nbe more particularly the case in literary composition, than either in\nacting or painting, because the adventurer in that department is not\nimpeded in his exertions by any peculiarity of features, or conformation\nof person, proper for particular parts, or, by any peculiar mechanical\nhabits of using the pencil, limited to a particular class of subjects.\n\nWhether this reasoning be correct or otherwise, the present author felt,\nthat, in confining himself to subjects purely Scottish, he was not only\nlikely to weary out the indulgence of his readers, but also greatly to\nlimit his own power of affording them pleasure. In a highly polished\ncountry, where so much genius is monthly employed in catering for public\namusement, a fresh topic, such as he had himself had the happiness to\nlight upon, is the untasted spring of the desert;--\n\n“Men bless their stars and call it luxury.”\n\nBut when men and horses, cattle, camels, and dromedaries, have poached\nthe spring into mud, it becomes loathsome to those who at first drank of\nit with rapture; and he who had the merit of discovering it, if he would\npreserve his reputation with the tribe, must display his talent by a\nfresh discovery of untasted fountains.\n\nIf the author, who finds himself limited to a particular class of\nsubjects, endeavours to sustain his reputation by striving to add a\nnovelty of attraction to themes of the same character which have been\nformerly successful under his management, there are manifest reasons\nwhy, after a certain point, he is likely to fail. If the mine be not\nwrought out, the strength and capacity of the miner become necessarily\nexhausted. If he closely imitates the narratives which he has before\nrendered successful, he is doomed to “wonder that they please no more.”\n If he struggles to take a different view of the same class of subjects,\nhe speedily discovers that what is obvious, graceful, and natural,\nhas been exhausted; and, in order to obtain the indispensable charm of\nnovelty, he is forced upon caricature, and, to avoid being trite, must\nbecome extravagant.\n\nIt is not, perhaps, necessary to enumerate so many reasons why the\nauthor of the Scottish Novels, as they were then exclusively termed,\nshould be desirous to make an experiment on a subject purely English.\nIt was his purpose, at the same time, to have rendered the experiment as\ncomplete as possible, by bringing the intended work before the public as\nthe effort of a new candidate for their favour, in order that no degree\nof prejudice, whether favourable or the reverse, might attach to it,\nas a new production of the Author of Waverley; but this intention was\nafterwards departed from, for reasons to be hereafter mentioned.\n\nThe period of the narrative adopted was the reign of Richard I., not\nonly as abounding with characters whose very names were sure to attract\ngeneral attention, but as affording a striking contrast betwixt the\nSaxons, by whom the soil was cultivated, and the Normans, who still\nreigned in it as conquerors, reluctant to mix with the vanquished, or\nacknowledge themselves of the same stock. The idea of this contrast was\ntaken from the ingenious and unfortunate Logan's tragedy of Runnamede,\nin which, about the same period of history, the author had seen the\nSaxon and Norman barons opposed to each other on different sides of the\nstage. He does not recollect that there was any attempt to contrast the\ntwo races in their habits and sentiments; and indeed it was obvious,\nthat history was violated by introducing the Saxons still existing as a\nhigh-minded and martial race of nobles.\n\nThey did, however, survive as a people, and some of the ancient Saxon\nfamilies possessed wealth and power, although they were exceptions to\nthe humble condition of the race in general. It seemed to the author,\nthat the existence of the two races in the same country, the vanquished\ndistinguished by their plain, homely, blunt manners, and the free spirit\ninfused by their ancient institutions and laws; the victors, by the\nhigh spirit of military fame, personal adventure, and whatever could\ndistinguish them as the Flower of Chivalry, might, intermixed with other\ncharacters belonging to the same time and country, interest the reader\nby the contrast, if the author should not fail on his part.\n\nScotland, however, had been of late used so exclusively as the scene\nof what is called Historical Romance, that the preliminary letter of Mr\nLaurence Templeton became in some measure necessary. To this, as to an\nIntroduction, the reader is referred, as expressing author's purpose and\nopinions in undertaking this species of composition, under the necessary\nreservation, that he is far from thinking he has attained the point at\nwhich he aimed.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that there was no idea or wish to\npass off the supposed Mr Templeton as a real person. But a kind of\ncontinuation of the Tales of my Landlord had been recently attempted by\na stranger, and it was supposed this Dedicatory Epistle might pass for\nsome imitation of the same kind, and thus putting enquirers upon a false\nscent, induce them to believe they had before them the work of some new\ncandidate for their favour.\n\nAfter a considerable part of the work had been finished and printed,\nthe Publishers, who pretended to discern in it a germ of popularity,\nremonstrated strenuously against its appearing as an absolutely\nanonymous production, and contended that it should have the advantage\nof being announced as by the Author of Waverley. The author did not make\nany obstinate opposition, for he began to be of opinion with Dr Wheeler,\nin Miss Edgeworth's excellent tale of “Maneuvering,” that “Trick upon\nTrick” might be too much for the patience of an indulgent public, and\nmight be reasonably considered as trifling with their favour.\n\nThe book, therefore, appeared as an avowed continuation of the Waverley\nNovels; and it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge, that it met with\nthe same favourable reception as its predecessors.\n\nSuch annotations as may be useful to assist the reader in comprehending\nthe characters of the Jew, the Templar, the Captain of the mercenaries,\nor Free Companions, as they were called, and others proper to the\nperiod, are added, but with a sparing hand, since sufficient information\non these subjects is to be found in general history.\n\nAn incident in the tale, which had the good fortune to find favour in\nthe eyes of many readers, is more directly borrowed from the stores of\nold romance. I mean the meeting of the King with Friar Tuck at the cell\nof that buxom hermit. The general tone of the story belongs to all ranks\nand all countries, which emulate each other in describing the rambles of\na disguised sovereign, who, going in search of information or amusement,\ninto the lower ranks of life, meets with adventures diverting to the\nreader or hearer, from the contrast betwixt the monarch's outward\nappearance, and his real character. The Eastern tale-teller has for his\ntheme the disguised expeditions of Haroun Alraschid with his faithful\nattendants, Mesrour and Giafar, through the midnight streets of Bagdad;\nand Scottish tradition dwells upon the similar exploits of James V.,\ndistinguished during such excursions by the travelling name of the\nGoodman of Ballengeigh, as the Commander of the Faithful, when he\ndesired to be incognito, was known by that of Il Bondocani. The French\nminstrels are not silent on so popular a theme. There must have been\na Norman original of the Scottish metrical romance of Rauf Colziar, in\nwhich Charlemagne is introduced as the unknown guest of a charcoal-man.\n[2]\n\nIt seems to have been the original of other poems of the kind.\n\nIn merry England there is no end of popular ballads on this theme. The\npoem of John the Reeve, or Steward, mentioned by Bishop Percy, in\nthe Reliques of English Poetry, [3] is said to have turned on such an\nincident; and we have besides, the King and the Tanner of Tamworth, the\nKing and the Miller of Mansfield, and others on the same topic. But\nthe peculiar tale of this nature to which the author of Ivanhoe has to\nacknowledge an obligation, is more ancient by two centuries than any of\nthese last mentioned.\n\nIt was first communicated to the public in that curious record of\nancient literature, which has been accumulated by the combined exertions\nof Sir Egerton Brydges. and Mr Hazlewood, in the periodical work\nentitled the British Bibliographer. From thence it has been transferred\nby the Reverend Charles Henry Hartsborne, M.A., editor of a very curious\nvolume, entitled “Ancient Metrical Tales, printed chiefly from original\nsources, 1829.” Mr Hartshorne gives no other authority for the present\nfragment, except the article in the Bibliographer, where it is entitled\nthe Kyng and the Hermite. A short abstract of its contents will show its\nsimilarity to the meeting of King Richard and Friar Tuck.\n\nKing Edward (we are not told which among the monarchs of that name, but,\nfrom his temper and habits, we may suppose Edward IV.) sets forth with\nhis court to a gallant hunting-match in Sherwood Forest, in which, as\nis not unusual for princes in romance, he falls in with a deer of\nextraordinary size and swiftness, and pursues it closely, till he has\noutstripped his whole retinue, tired out hounds and horse, and finds\nhimself alone under the gloom of an extensive forest, upon which\nnight is descending. Under the apprehensions natural to a situation so\nuncomfortable, the king recollects that he has heard how poor men, when\napprehensive of a bad nights lodging, pray to Saint Julian, who, in the\nRomish calendar, stands Quarter-Master-General to all forlorn travellers\nthat render him due homage. Edward puts up his orisons accordingly, and\nby the guidance, doubtless, of the good Saint, reaches a small path,\nconducting him to a chapel in the forest, having a hermit's cell in its\nclose vicinity. The King hears the reverend man, with a companion of his\nsolitude, telling his beads within, and meekly requests of him quarters\nfor the night. “I have no accommodation for such a lord as ye be,” said\nthe Hermit. “I live here in the wilderness upon roots and rinds, and may\nnot receive into my dwelling even the poorest wretch that lives, unless\nit were to save his life.” The King enquires the way to the next\ntown, and, understanding it is by a road which he cannot find without\ndifficulty, even if he had daylight to befriend him, he declares, that\nwith or without the Hermit's consent, he is determined to be his guest\nthat night. He is admitted accordingly, not without a hint from the\nRecluse, that were he himself out of his priestly weeds, he would care\nlittle for his threats of using violence, and that he gives way to him\nnot out of intimidation, but simply to avoid scandal.\n\nThe King is admitted into the cell--two bundles of straw are shaken\ndown for his accommodation, and he comforts himself that he is now under\nshelter, and that\n\n     “A night will soon be gone.”\n\nOther wants, however, arise. The guest becomes clamorous for supper,\nobserving,\n\n     “For certainly, as I you say,\n     I ne had never so sorry a day,\n     That I ne had a merry night.”\n\nBut this indication of his taste for good cheer, joined to the\nannunciation of his being a follower of the Court, who had lost himself\nat the great hunting-match, cannot induce the niggard Hermit to produce\nbetter fare than bread and cheese, for which his guest showed little\nappetite; and “thin drink,” which was even less acceptable. At length\nthe King presses his host on a point to which he had more than once\nalluded, without obtaining a satisfactory reply:\n\n     “Then said the King, 'by God's grace,\n     Thou wert in a merry place,\n     To shoot should thou here\n     When the foresters go to rest,\n     Sometyme thou might have of the best,\n     All of the wild deer;\n     I wold hold it for no scathe,\n     Though thou hadst bow and arrows baith,\n     Althoff thou best a Frere.'”\n\nThe Hermit, in return, expresses his apprehension that his guest means\nto drag him into some confession of offence against the forest laws,\nwhich, being betrayed to the King, might cost him his life. Edward\nanswers by fresh assurances of secrecy, and again urges on him the\nnecessity of procuring some venison. The Hermit replies, by once more\ninsisting on the duties incumbent upon him as a churchman, and continues\nto affirm himself free from all such breaches of order:\n\n     “Many day I have here been,\n     And flesh-meat I eat never,\n     But milk of the kye;\n     Warm thee well, and go to sleep,\n     And I will lap thee with my cope,\n     Softly to lye.”\n\nIt would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not find\nthe reasons which finally induce the curtal Friar to amend the King's\ncheer. But acknowledging his guest to be such a “good fellow” as has\nseldom graced his board, the holy man at length produces the best his\ncell affords. Two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked\npasties are displayed by the light, besides choice of venison, both salt\nand fresh, from which they select collops. “I might have eaten my bread\ndry,” said the King, “had I not pressed thee on the score of archery,\nbut now have I dined like a prince--if we had but drink enow.”\n\nThis too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite, who dispatches an\nassistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner near his\nbed, and the whole three set in to serious drinking. This amusement\nis superintended by the Friar, according to the recurrence of certain\nfustian words, to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he\ndrank--a species of High Jinks, as it were, by which they regulated\ntheir potations, as toasts were given in latter times. The one toper\nsays “fusty bandias”, to which the other is obliged to reply, “strike\npantnere”, and the Friar passes many jests on the King's want of memory,\nwho sometimes forgets the words of action. The night is spent in this\njolly pastime. Before his departure in the morning, the King invites his\nreverend host to Court, promises, at least, to requite his hospitality,\nand expresses himself much pleased with his entertainment. The jolly\nHermit at length agrees to venture thither, and to enquire for Jack\nFletcher, which is the name assumed by the King. After the Hermit has\nshown Edward some feats of archery, the joyous pair separate. The King\nrides home, and rejoins his retinue. As the romance is imperfect, we are\nnot acquainted how the discovery takes place; but it is probably much\nin the same manner as in other narratives turning on the same subject,\nwhere the host, apprehensive of death for having trespassed on the\nrespect due to his Sovereign, while incognito, is agreeably surprised by\nreceiving honours and reward.\n\nIn Mr Hartshorne's collection, there is a romance on the same\nfoundation, called King Edward and the Shepherd, [4]\n\nwhich, considered as illustrating manners, is still more curious than\nthe King and the Hermit; but it is foreign to the present purpose.\nThe reader has here the original legend from which the incident in the\nromance is derived; and the identifying the irregular Eremite with the\nFriar Tuck of Robin Hood's story, was an obvious expedient.\n\nThe name of Ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. All novelists have\nhad occasion at some time or other to wish with Falstaff, that they knew\nwhere a commodity of good names was to be had. On such an occasion the\nauthor chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of the\nmanors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking\nthe Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis:\n\n     “Tring, Wing, and Ivanhoe,\n     For striking of a blow,\n     Hampden did forego,\n     And glad he could escape so.”\n\nThe word suited the author's purpose in two material respects,--for,\nfirst, it had an ancient English sound; and secondly, it conveyed no\nindication whatever of the nature of the story. He presumes to hold\nthis last quality to be of no small importance. What is called a taking\ntitle, serves the direct interest of the bookseller or publisher, who by\nthis means sometimes sells an edition while it is yet passing the press.\nBut if the author permits an over degree of attention to be drawn to\nhis work ere it has appeared, he places himself in the embarrassing\ncondition of having excited a degree of expectation which, if he\nproves unable to satisfy, is an error fatal to his literary reputation.\nBesides, when we meet such a title as the Gunpowder Plot, or any other\nconnected with general history, each reader, before he has seen the\nbook, has formed to himself some particular idea of the sort of manner\nin which the story is to be conducted, and the nature of the amusement\nwhich he is to derive from it. In this he is probably disappointed, and\nin that case may be naturally disposed to visit upon the author or the\nwork, the unpleasant feelings thus excited. In such a case the literary\nadventurer is censured, not for having missed the mark at which he\nhimself aimed, but for not having shot off his shaft in a direction he\nnever thought of.\n\nOn the footing of unreserved communication which the Author has\nestablished with the reader, he may here add the trifling circumstance,\nthat a roll of Norman warriors, occurring in the Auchinleck Manuscript,\ngave him the formidable name of Front-de-Boeuf.\n\nIvanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance, and may be said to\nhave procured for its author the freedom of the Rules, since he has ever\nsince been permitted to exercise his powers of fictitious composition in\nEngland, as well as Scotland.\n\nThe character of the fair Jewess found so much favour in the eyes of\nsome fair readers, that the writer was censured, because, when arranging\nthe fates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned the hand\nof Wilfred to Rebecca, rather than the less interesting Rowena. But, not\nto mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost\nimpossible, the author may, in passing, observe, that he thinks a\ncharacter of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is degraded rather than\nexalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity. Such\nis not the recompense which Providence has deemed worthy of suffering\nmerit, and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons,\nthe most common readers of romance, that rectitude of conduct and of\nprinciple are either naturally allied with, or adequately rewarded by,\nthe gratification of our passions, or attainment of our wishes. In a\nword, if a virtuous and self-denied character is dismissed with temporal\nwealth, greatness, rank, or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or\nill assorted passion as that of Rebecca for Ivanhoe, the reader will be\napt to say, verily Virtue has had its reward. But a glance on the great\npicture of life will show, that the duties of self-denial, and the\nsacrifice of passion to principle, are seldom thus remunerated; and\nthat the internal consciousness of their high-minded discharge of duty,\nproduces on their own reflections a more adequate recompense, in the\nform of that peace which the world cannot give or take away.\n\nAbbotsford, 1st September, 1830.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATORY EPISTLE\n\nTO\n\nTHE REV. DR DRYASDUST, F.A.S.\n\nResiding in the Castle-Gate, York.\n\n\nMuch esteemed and dear Sir,\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention the various and concurring reasons\nwhich induce me to place your name at the head of the following\nwork. Yet the chief of these reasons may perhaps be refuted by the\nimperfections of the performance. Could I have hoped to render it worthy\nof your patronage, the public would at once have seen the propriety of\ninscribing a work designed to illustrate the domestic antiquities of\nEngland, and particularly of our Saxon forefathers, to the learned\nauthor of the Essays upon the Horn of King Ulphus, and on the Lands\nbestowed by him upon the patrimony of St Peter. I am conscious, however,\nthat the slight, unsatisfactory, and trivial manner, in which the result\nof my antiquarian researches has been recorded in the following pages,\ntakes the work from under that class which bears the proud motto,\n“Detur digniori”. On the contrary, I fear I shall incur the censure of\npresumption in placing the venerable name of Dr Jonas Dryasdust at the\nhead of a publication, which the more grave antiquary will perhaps class\nwith the idle novels and romances of the day. I am anxious to vindicate\nmyself from such a charge; for although I might trust to your friendship\nfor an apology in your eyes, yet I would not willingly stand conviction\nin those of the public of so grave a crime, as my fears lead me to\nanticipate my being charged with.\n\nI must therefore remind you, that when we first talked over together\nthat class of productions, in one of which the private and family\naffairs of your learned northern friend, Mr Oldbuck of Monkbarns, were\nso unjustifiably exposed to the public, some discussion occurred between\nus concerning the cause of the popularity these works have attained\nin this idle age, which, whatever other merit they possess, must be\nadmitted to be hastily written, and in violation of every rule assigned\nto the epopeia. It seemed then to be your opinion, that the charm lay\nentirely in the art with which the unknown author had availed himself,\nlike a second M'Pherson, of the antiquarian stores which lay scattered\naround him, supplying his own indolence or poverty of invention, by the\nincidents which had actually taken place in his country at no distant\nperiod, by introducing real characters, and scarcely suppressing real\nnames. It was not above sixty or seventy years, you observed, since the\nwhole north of Scotland was under a state of government nearly as simple\nand as patriarchal as those of our good allies the Mohawks and Iroquois.\nAdmitting that the author cannot himself be supposed to have witnessed\nthose times, he must have lived, you observed, among persons who had\nacted and suffered in them; and even within these thirty years, such\nan infinite change has taken place in the manners of Scotland, that\nmen look back upon the habits of society proper to their immediate\nancestors, as we do on those of the reign of Queen Anne, or even the\nperiod of the Revolution. Having thus materials of every kind lying\nstrewed around him, there was little, you observed, to embarrass the\nauthor, but the difficulty of choice. It was no wonder, therefore, that,\nhaving begun to work a mine so plentiful, he should have derived from\nhis works fully more credit and profit than the facility of his labours\nmerited.\n\nAdmitting (as I could not deny) the general truth of these conclusions,\nI cannot but think it strange that no attempt has been made to excite an\ninterest for the traditions and manners of Old England, similiar to\nthat which has been obtained in behalf of those of our poorer and\nless celebrated neighbours. The Kendal green, though its date is more\nancient, ought surely to be as dear to our feelings, as the variegated\ntartans of the north. The name of Robin Hood, if duly conjured with,\nshould raise a spirit as soon as that of Rob Roy; and the patriots of\nEngland deserve no less their renown in our modern circles, than the\nBruces and Wallaces of Caledonia. If the scenery of the south be less\nromantic and sublime than that of the northern mountains, it must be\nallowed to possess in the same proportion superior softness and beauty;\nand upon the whole, we feel ourselves entitled to exclaim with the\npatriotic Syrian--“Are not Pharphar and Abana, rivers of Damascus,\nbetter than all the rivers of Israel?”\n\nYour objections to such an attempt, my dear Doctor, were, you may\nremember, two-fold. You insisted upon the advantages which the Scotsman\npossessed, from the very recent existence of that state of society\nin which his scene was to be laid. Many now alive, you remarked, well\nremembered persons who had not only seen the celebrated Roy\nM'Gregor, but had feasted, and even fought with him. All those minute\ncircumstances belonging to private life and domestic character, all that\ngives verisimilitude to a narrative, and individuality to the persons\nintroduced, is still known and remembered in Scotland; whereas in\nEngland, civilisation has been so long complete, that our ideas of our\nancestors are only to be gleaned from musty records and chronicles, the\nauthors of which seem perversely to have conspired to suppress in their\nnarratives all interesting details, in order to find room for flowers of\nmonkish eloquence, or trite reflections upon morals. To match an English\nand a Scottish author in the rival task of embodying and reviving the\ntraditions of their respective countries, would be, you alleged, in the\nhighest degree unequal and unjust. The Scottish magician, you said, was,\nlike Lucan's witch, at liberty to walk over the recent field of battle,\nand to select for the subject of resuscitation by his sorceries, a body\nwhose limbs had recently quivered with existence, and whose throat\nhad but just uttered the last note of agony. Such a subject even the\npowerful Erictho was compelled to select, as alone capable of being\nreanimated even by “her” potent magic--\n\n     ----gelidas leto scrutata medullas,\n     Pulmonis rigidi stantes sine vulnere fibras\n     Invenit, et vocem defuncto in corpore quaerit.\n\nThe English author, on the other hand, without supposing him less of\na conjuror than the Northern Warlock, can, you observed, only have the\nliberty of selecting his subject amidst the dust of antiquity, where\nnothing was to be found but dry, sapless, mouldering, and disjointed\nbones, such as those which filled the valley of Jehoshaphat. You\nexpressed, besides, your apprehension, that the unpatriotic prejudices\nof my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of\nwhich I endeavoured to demonstrate the probable success. And this, you\nsaid, was not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of\nthat which is foreign, but that it rested partly upon improbabilities,\narising out of the circumstances in which the English reader is placed.\nIf you describe to him a set of wild manners, and a state of primitive\nsociety existing in the Highlands of Scotland, he is much disposed to\nacquiesce in the truth of what is asserted. And reason good. If he be\nof the ordinary class of readers, he has either never seen those remote\ndistricts at all, or he has wandered through those desolate regions in\nthe course of a summer tour, eating bad dinners, sleeping on truckle\nbeds, stalking from desolation to desolation, and fully prepared to\nbelieve the strangest things that could be told him of a people, wild\nand extravagant enough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary.\nBut the same worthy person, when placed in his own snug parlour, and\nsurrounded by all the comforts of an Englishman's fireside, is not half\nso much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different\nlife from himself; that the shattered tower, which now forms a vista\nfrom his window, once held a baron who would have hung him up at his\nown door without any form of trial; that the hinds, by whom his little\npet-farm is managed, a few centuries ago would have been his slaves;\nand that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended over the\nneighbouring village, where the attorney is now a man of more importance\nthan the lord of the manor.\n\nWhile I own the force of these objections, I must confess, at the same\ntime, that they do not appear to me to be altogether insurmountable. The\nscantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difficulty; but no one\nknows better than Dr Dryasdust, that to those deeply read in antiquity,\nhints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie scattered\nthrough the pages of our various historians, bearing, indeed, a slender\nproportion to the other matters of which they treat, but still, when\ncollected together, sufficient to throw considerable light upon the “vie\nprive” of our forefathers; indeed, I am convinced, that however I myself\nmay fail in the ensuing attempt, yet, with more labour in collecting, or\nmore skill in using, the materials within his reach, illustrated as they\nhave been by the labours of Dr Henry, of the late Mr Strutt, and, above\nall, of Mr Sharon Turner, an abler hand would have been successful;\nand therefore I protest, beforehand, against any argument which may be\nfounded on the failure of the present experiment.\n\nOn the other hand, I have already said, that if any thing like a true\npicture of old English manners could be drawn, I would trust to the\ngood-nature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable\nreception.\n\nHaving thus replied, to the best of my power, to the first class of\nyour objections, or at least having shown my resolution to overleap the\nbarriers which your prudence has raised, I will be brief in noticing\nthat which is more peculiar to myself. It seems to be your opinion, that\nthe very office of an antiquary, employed in grave, and, as the\nvulgar will sometimes allege, in toilsome and minute research, must be\nconsidered as incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale of\nthis sort. But permit me to say, my dear Doctor, that this objection\nis rather formal than substantial. It is true, that such slight\ncompositions might not suit the severer genius of our friend Mr Oldbuck.\nYet Horace Walpole wrote a goblin tale which has thrilled through many a\nbosom; and George Ellis could transfer all the playful fascination of\na humour, as delightful as it was uncommon, into his Abridgement of the\nAncient Metrical Romances. So that, however I may have occasion to rue\nmy present audacity, I have at least the most respectable precedents in\nmy favour.\n\nStill the severer antiquary may think, that, by thus intermingling\nfiction with truth, I am polluting the well of history with modern\ninventions, and impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of the\nage which I describe. I cannot but in some sense admit the force of this\nreasoning, which I yet hope to traverse by the following considerations.\n\nIt is true, that I neither can, nor do pretend, to the observation of\ncomplete accuracy, even in matters of outward costume, much less in the\nmore important points of language and manners. But the same motive\nwhich prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece in Anglo-Saxon or in\nNorman-French, and which prohibits my sending forth to the public this\nessay printed with the types of Caxton or Wynken de Worde, prevents my\nattempting to confine myself within the limits of the period in which my\nstory is laid. It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that\nthe subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners,\nas well as the language, of the age we live in. No fascination has\never been attached to Oriental literature, equal to that produced by Mr\nGalland's first translation of the Arabian Tales; in which, retaining\non the one hand the splendour of Eastern costume, and on the other the\nwildness of Eastern fiction, he mixed these with just so much ordinary\nfeeling and expression, as rendered them interesting and intelligible,\nwhile he abridged the long-winded narratives, curtailed the monotonous\nreflections, and rejected the endless repetitions of the Arabian\noriginal. The tales, therefore, though less purely Oriental than in\ntheir first concoction, were eminently better fitted for the European\nmarket, and obtained an unrivalled degree of public favour, which they\ncertainly would never have gained had not the manners and style been\nin some degree familiarized to the feelings and habits of the western\nreader.\n\nIn point of justice, therefore, to the multitudes who will, I trust,\ndevour this book with avidity, I have so far explained our ancient\nmanners in modern language, and so far detailed the characters and\nsentiments of my persons, that the modern reader will not find himself,\nI should hope, much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere\nantiquity. In this, I respectfully contend, I have in no respect\nexceeded the fair license due to the author of a fictitious composition.\nThe late ingenious Mr Strutt, in his romance of Queen-Hoo-Hall, [5]\nacted upon another principle; and in distinguishing between what was\nancient and modern, forgot, as it appears to me, that extensive neutral\nground, the large proportion, that is, of manners and sentiments which\nare common to us and to our ancestors, having been handed down unaltered\nfrom them to us, or which, arising out of the principles of our common\nnature, must have existed alike in either state of society. In this\nmanner, a man of talent, and of great antiquarian erudition, limited the\npopularity of his work, by excluding from it every thing which was not\nsufficiently obsolete to be altogether forgotten and unintelligible.\n\nThe license which I would here vindicate, is so necessary to the\nexecution of my plan, that I will crave your patience while I illustrate\nmy argument a little farther.\n\nHe who first opens Chaucer, or any other ancient poet, is so much\nstruck with the obsolete spelling, multiplied consonants, and antiquated\nappearance of the language, that he is apt to lay the work down in\ndespair, as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity, to permit his\njudging of its merits or tasting its beauties. But if some intelligent\nand accomplished friend points out to him, that the difficulties by\nwhich he is startled are more in appearance than reality, if, by\nreading aloud to him, or by reducing the ordinary words to the modern\northography, he satisfies his proselyte that only about one-tenth part\nof the words employed are in fact obsolete, the novice may be easily\npersuaded to approach the “well of English undefiled,” with the\ncertainty that a slender degree of patience will enable him to to enjoy\nboth the humour and the pathos with which old Geoffrey delighted the age\nof Cressy and of Poictiers.\n\nTo pursue this a little farther. If our neophyte, strong in the new-born\nlove of antiquity, were to undertake to imitate what he had learnt to\nadmire, it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously, if he were\nto select from the Glossary the obsolete words which it contains, and\nemploy those exclusively of all phrases and vocables retained in modern\ndays. This was the error of the unfortunate Chatterton. In order to give\nhis language the appearance of antiquity, he rejected every word that\nwas modern, and produced a dialect entirely different from any that\nhad ever been spoken in Great Britain. He who would imitate an ancient\nlanguage with success, must attend rather to its grammatical character,\nturn of expression, and mode of arrangement, than labour to collect\nextraordinary and antiquated terms, which, as I have already averred, do\nnot in ancient authors approach the number of words still in use, though\nperhaps somewhat altered in sense and spelling, in the proportion of one\nto ten.\n\nWhat I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to\nsentiments and manners. The passions, the sources from which these must\nspring in all their modifications, are generally the same in all ranks\nand conditions, all countries and ages; and it follows, as a matter\nof course, that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions, however\ninfluenced by the peculiar state of society, must still, upon the whole,\nbear a strong resemblance to each other. Our ancestors were not more\ndistinct from us, surely, than Jews are from Christians; they had “eyes,\nhands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions;” were “fed with\nthe same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases,\nwarmed and cooled by the same winter and summer,” as ourselves. The\ntenor, therefore, of their affections and feelings, must have borne the\nsame general proportion to our own.\n\nIt follows, therefore, that of the materials which an author has to\nuse in a romance, or fictitious composition, such as I have ventured\nto attempt, he will find that a great proportion, both of language and\nmanners, is as proper to the present time as to those in which he has\nlaid his time of action. The freedom of choice which this allows him,\nis therefore much greater, and the difficulty of his task much more\ndiminished, than at first appears. To take an illustration from a sister\nart, the antiquarian details may be said to represent the peculiar\nfeatures of a landscape under delineation of the pencil. His feudal\ntower must arise in due majesty; the figures which he introduces must\nhave the costume and character of their age; the piece must represent\nthe peculiar features of the scene which he has chosen for his subject,\nwith all its appropriate elevation of rock, or precipitate descent of\ncataract. His general colouring, too, must be copied from Nature: The\nsky must be clouded or serene, according to the climate, and the general\ntints must be those which prevail in a natural landscape. So far the\npainter is bound down by the rules of his art, to a precise imitation of\nthe features of Nature; but it is not required that he should descend to\ncopy all her more minute features, or represent with absolute exactness\nthe very herbs, flowers, and trees, with which the spot is decorated.\nThese, as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow, are\nattributes proper to scenery in general, natural to each situation, and\nsubject to the artist's disposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.\n\nIt is true, that this license is confined in either case within\nlegitimate bounds. The painter must introduce no ornament inconsistent\nwith the climate or country of his landscape; he must not plant cypress\ntrees upon Inch-Merrin, or Scottish firs among the ruins of Persepolis;\nand the author lies under a corresponding restraint. However far he may\nventure in a more full detail of passions and feelings, than is to be\nfound in the ancient compositions which he imitates, he must introduce\nnothing inconsistent with the manners of the age; his knights, squires,\ngrooms, and yeomen, may be more fully drawn than in the hard, dry\ndelineations of an ancient illuminated manuscript, but the character and\ncostume of the age must remain inviolate; they must be the same figures,\ndrawn by a better pencil, or, to speak more modestly, executed in an age\nwhen the principles of art were better understood. His language must\nnot be exclusively obsolete and unintelligible; but he should admit, if\npossible, no word or turn of phraseology betraying an origin directly\nmodern. It is one thing to make use of the language and sentiments which\nare common to ourselves and our forefathers, and it is another to\ninvest them with the sentiments and dialect exclusively proper to their\ndescendants.\n\nThis, my dear friend, I have found the most difficult part of my task;\nand, to speak frankly, I hardly expect to satisfy your less partial\njudgment, and more extensive knowledge of such subjects, since I have\nhardly been able to please my own.\n\nI am conscious that I shall be found still more faulty in the tone of\nkeeping and costume, by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine\nmy Tale, with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my\nactors flourished: It may be, that I have introduced little which can\npositively be termed modern; but, on the other hand, it is extremely\nprobable that I may have confused the manners of two or three centuries,\nand introduced, during the reign of Richard the First, circumstances\nappropriated to a period either considerably earlier, or a good deal\nlater than that era. It is my comfort, that errors of this kind will\nescape the general class of readers, and that I may share in the\nill-deserved applause of those architects, who, in their modern Gothic,\ndo not hesitate to introduce, without rule or method, ornaments proper\nto different styles and to different periods of the art. Those\nwhose extensive researches have given them the means of judging my\nbackslidings with more severity, will probably be lenient in proportion\nto their knowledge of the difficulty of my task. My honest and neglected\nfriend, Ingulphus, has furnished me with many a valuable hint; but the\nlight afforded by the Monk of Croydon, and Geoffrey de Vinsauff, is\ndimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and unintelligible\nmatter, that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful pages of the\ngallant Froissart, although he flourished at a period so much more\nremote from the date of my history. If, therefore, my dear friend, you\nhave generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt, to frame for\nmyself a minstrel coronet, partly out of the pearls of pure antiquity,\nand partly from the Bristol stones and paste, with which I have\nendeavoured to imitate them, I am convinced your opinion of the\ndifficulty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect manner of its\nexecution.\n\nOf my materials I have but little to say. They may be chiefly found in\nthe singular Anglo-Norman MS., which Sir Arthur Wardour preserves with\nsuch jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet, scarcely\nallowing any one to touch it, and being himself not able to read one\nsyllable of its contents. I should never have got his consent, on my\nvisit to Scotland, to read in those precious pages for so many hours,\nhad I not promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing,\nas {The Wardour Manuscript}; giving it, thereby, an individuality\nas important as the Bannatyne MS., the Auchinleck MS., and any other\nmonument of the patience of a Gothic scrivener. I have sent, for your\nprivate consideration, a list of the contents of this curious piece,\nwhich I shall perhaps subjoin, with your approbation, to the third\nvolume of my Tale, in case the printer's devil should continue impatient\nfor copy, when the whole of my narrative has been imposed.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend; I have said enough to explain, if not to\nvindicate, the attempt which I have made, and which, in spite of your\ndoubts, and my own incapacity, I am still willing to believe has not\nbeen altogether made in vain.\n\nI hope you are now well recovered from your spring fit of the gout, and\nshall be happy if the advice of your learned physician should recommend\na tour to these parts. Several curiosities have been lately dug up near\nthe wall, as well as at the ancient station of Habitancum. Talking of\nthe latter, I suppose you have long since heard the news, that a sulky\nchurlish boor has destroyed the ancient statue, or rather bas-relief,\npopularly called Robin of Redesdale. It seems Robin's fame attracted\nmore visitants than was consistent with the growth of the heather, upon\na moor worth a shilling an acre. Reverend as you write yourself, be\nrevengeful for once, and pray with me that he may be visited with such\na fit of the stone, as if he had all the fragments of poor Robin in that\nregion of his viscera where the disease holds its seat. Tell this not in\nGath, lest the Scots rejoice that they have at length found a parallel\ninstance among their neighbours, to that barbarous deed which demolished\nArthur's Oven. But there is no end to lamentation, when we betake\nourselves to such subjects. My respectful compliments attend Miss\nDryasdust; I endeavoured to match the spectacles agreeable to her\ncommission, during my late journey to London, and hope she has received\nthem safe, and found them satisfactory. I send this by the blind\ncarrier, so that probably it may be some time upon its journey. [6]\n\nThe last news which I hear from Edinburgh is, that the gentleman who\nfills the situation of Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of\nScotland, [7] is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom, and that\nmuch is expected from his skill and zeal in delineating those specimens\nof national antiquity, which are either mouldering under the slow\ntouch of time, or swept away by modern taste, with the same besom of\ndestruction which John Knox used at the Reformation. Once more adieu;\n“vale tandem, non immemor mei”. Believe me to be,\n\nReverend, and very dear Sir,\n\nYour most faithful humble Servant.\n\nLaurence Templeton.\n\nToppingwold, near Egremont, Cumberland, Nov. 17, 1817.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIVANHOE.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n     Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome,\n     The full-fed swine return'd with evening home;\n     Compell'd, reluctant, to the several sties,\n     With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.\n     Pope's Odyssey\n\n\nIn that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the\nriver Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering\nthe greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between\nSheffield and the pleasant town of Doncaster. The remains of this\nextensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of\nWarncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the fabulous\nDragon of Wantley; here were fought many of the most desperate battles\nduring the Civil Wars of the Roses; and here also flourished in ancient\ntimes those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so\npopular in English song.\n\nSuch being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period\ntowards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his\nlong captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his\ndespairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjected to every species\nof subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become exorbitant\nduring the reign of Stephen, and whom the prudence of Henry the Second\nhad scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown, had now\nresumed their ancient license in its utmost extent; despising the feeble\ninterference of the English Council of State, fortifying their castles,\nincreasing the number of their dependants, reducing all around them to a\nstate of vassalage, and striving by every means in their power, to place\nthemselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a\nfigure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending.\n\nThe situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were called,\nwho, by the law and spirit of the English constitution, were entitled\nto hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually\nprecarious. If, as was most generally the case, they placed themselves\nunder the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity,\naccepted of feudal offices in his household, or bound themselves by\nmutual treaties of alliance and protection, to support him in his\nenterprises, they might indeed purchase temporary repose; but it must\nbe with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to every\nEnglish bosom, and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in\nwhatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him\nto undertake. On the other hand, such and so multiplied were the means\nof vexation and oppression possessed by the great Barons, that they\nnever wanted the pretext, and seldom the will, to harass and pursue,\neven to the very edge of destruction, any of their less powerful\nneighbours, who attempted to separate themselves from their authority,\nand to trust for their protection, during the dangers of the times, to\ntheir own inoffensive conduct, and to the laws of the land.\n\nA circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the\nnobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from\nthe consequences of the Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four\ngenerations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the Normans\nand Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests,\ntwo hostile races, one of which still felt the elation of triumph, while\nthe other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power had\nbeen completely placed in the hands of the Norman nobility, by the event\nof the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories assure\nus, with no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and nobles\nhad been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were\nthe numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers,\neven as proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal\npolicy had long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the\nstrength of a part of the population which was justly considered as\nnourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor. All the\nmonarchs of the Norman race had shown the most marked predilection for\ntheir Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and many others equally\nunknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxon constitution,\nhad been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants, to add\nweight, as it were, to the feudal chains with which they were loaded. At\ncourt, and in the castles of the great nobles, where the pomp and state\nof a court was emulated, Norman-French was the only language employed;\nin courts of law, the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same\ntongue. In short, French was the language of honour, of chivalry, and\neven of justice, while the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon\nwas abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds, who knew no other. Still,\nhowever, the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil,\nand those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated,\noccasioned the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded betwixt\nthe French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render themselves\nmutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity arose by\ndegrees the structure of our present English language, in which the\nspeech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended\ntogether; and which has since been so richly improved by importations\nfrom the classical languages, and from those spoken by the southern\nnations of Europe.\n\nThis state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the\ninformation of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that,\nalthough no great historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark\nthe existence of the Anglo-Saxons as a separate people subsequent to the\nreign of William the Second; yet the great national distinctions betwixt\nthem and their conquerors, the recollection of what they had formerly\nbeen, and to what they were now reduced, continued down to the reign\nof Edward the Third, to keep open the wounds which the Conquest had\ninflicted, and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants\nof the victor Normans and the vanquished Saxons.\n\nThe sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest,\nwhich we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. Hundreds of\nbroad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed\nperhaps the stately march of the Roman soldiery, flung their gnarled\narms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward; in some\nplaces they were intermingled with beeches, hollies, and copsewood of\nvarious descriptions, so closely as totally to intercept the level beams\nof the sinking sun; in others they receded from each other, forming\nthose long sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the eye delights\nto lose itself, while imagination considers them as the paths to yet\nwilder scenes of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun shot a\nbroken and discoloured light, that partially hung upon the shattered\nboughs and mossy trunks of the trees, and there they illuminated in\nbrilliant patches the portions of turf to which they made their way. A\nconsiderable open space, in the midst of this glade, seemed formerly to\nhave been dedicated to the rites of Druidical superstition; for, on\nthe summit of a hillock, so regular as to seem artificial, there still\nremained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones, of large dimensions.\nSeven stood upright; the rest had been dislodged from their places,\nprobably by the zeal of some convert to Christianity, and lay, some\nprostrate near their former site, and others on the side of the hill.\nOne large stone only had found its way to the bottom, and in stopping\nthe course of a small brook, which glided smoothly round the foot of\nthe eminence, gave, by its opposition, a feeble voice of murmur to the\nplacid and elsewhere silent streamlet.\n\nThe human figures which completed this landscape, were in number two,\npartaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild and rustic\ncharacter, which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of\nYorkshire at that early period. The eldest of these men had a\nstern, savage, and wild aspect. His garment was of the simplest form\nimaginable, being a close jacket with sleeves, composed of the tanned\nskin of some animal, on which the hair had been originally left, but\nwhich had been worn off in so many places, that it would have been\ndifficult to distinguish from the patches that remained, to what\ncreature the fur had belonged. This primeval vestment reached from\nthe throat to the knees, and served at once all the usual purposes\nof body-clothing; there was no wider opening at the collar, than\nwas necessary to admit the passage of the head, from which it may be\ninferred, that it was put on by slipping it over the head and shoulders,\nin the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk. Sandals, bound\nwith thongs made of boars' hide, protected the feet, and a roll of thin\nleather was twined artificially round the legs, and, ascending above the\ncalf, left the knees bare, like those of a Scottish Highlander. To make\nthe jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was gathered at the middle\nby a broad leathern belt, secured by a brass buckle; to one side of\nwhich was attached a sort of scrip, and to the other a ram's horn,\naccoutred with a mouthpiece, for the purpose of blowing. In the same\nbelt was stuck one of those long, broad, sharp-pointed, and two-edged\nknives, with a buck's-horn handle, which were fabricated in the\nneighbourhood, and bore even at this early period the name of a\nSheffield whittle. The man had no covering upon his head, which was\nonly defended by his own thick hair, matted and twisted together, and\nscorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty dark-red colour,\nforming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks, which was\nrather of a yellow or amber hue. One part of his dress only remains, but\nit is too remarkable to be suppressed; it was a brass ring, resembling a\ndog's collar, but without any opening, and soldered fast round his neck,\nso loose as to form no impediment to his breathing, yet so tight as to\nbe incapable of being removed, excepting by the use of the file. On this\nsingular gorget was engraved, in Saxon characters, an inscription of the\nfollowing purport:--“Gurth, the son of Beowulph, is the born thrall of\nCedric of Rotherwood.”\n\nBeside the swine-herd, for such was Gurth's occupation, was seated, upon\none of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person about ten years younger\nin appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companion's in\nform, was of better materials, and of a more fantastic appearance. His\njacket had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had\nbeen some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours. To\nthe jacket he added a short cloak, which scarcely reached half way down\nhis thigh; it was of crimson cloth, though a good deal soiled, lined\nwith bright yellow; and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the\nother, or at his pleasure draw it all around him, its width, contrasted\nwith its want of longitude, formed a fantastic piece of drapery. He had\nthin silver bracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar of the\nsame metal bearing the inscription, “Wamba, the son of Witless, is the\nthrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.” This personage had the same sort of\nsandals with his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong,\nhis legs were cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the\nother yellow. He was provided also with a cap, having around it more\nthan one bell, about the size of those attached to hawks, which jingled\nas he turned his head to one side or other; and as he seldom remained a\nminute in the same posture, the sound might be considered as incessant.\nAround the edge of this cap was a stiff bandeau of leather, cut at the\ntop into open work, resembling a coronet, while a prolonged bag arose\nfrom within it, and fell down on one shoulder like an old-fashioned\nnightcap, or a jelly-bag, or the head-gear of a modern hussar. It was to\nthis part of the cap that the bells were attached; which circumstance,\nas well as the shape of his head-dress, and his own half-crazed,\nhalf-cunning expression of countenance, sufficiently pointed him out as\nbelonging to the race of domestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the\nhouses of the wealthy, to help away the tedium of those lingering\nhours which they were obliged to spend within doors. He bore, like\nhis companion, a scrip, attached to his belt, but had neither horn nor\nknife, being probably considered as belonging to a class whom it is\nesteemed dangerous to intrust with edge-tools. In place of these, he\nwas equipped with a sword of lath, resembling that with which Harlequin\noperates his wonders upon the modern stage.\n\nThe outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger\ncontrast than their look and demeanour. That of the serf, or bondsman,\nwas sad and sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance\nof deep dejection, which might be almost construed into apathy, had\nnot the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that\nthere slumbered, under the appearance of sullen despondency, a sense of\noppression, and a disposition to resistance. The looks of Wamba, on\nthe other hand, indicated, as usual with his class, a sort of vacant\ncuriosity, and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose, together\nwith the utmost self-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and the\nappearance which he made. The dialogue which they maintained between\nthem, was carried on in Anglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was\nuniversally spoken by the inferior classes, excepting the Norman\nsoldiers, and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal\nnobles. But to give their conversation in the original would convey but\nlittle information to the modern reader, for whose benefit we beg to\noffer the following translation:\n\n“The curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!” said the\nswine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together\nthe scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes\nequally melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from the\nluxurious banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened,\nor to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet, where several of them,\nhalf plunged in mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether regardless\nof the voice of their keeper. “The curse of St Withold upon them and\nupon me!” said Gurth; “if the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them\nere nightfall, I am no true man. Here, Fangs! Fangs!” he ejaculated at\nthe top of his voice to a ragged wolfish-looking dog, a sort of lurcher,\nhalf mastiff, half greyhound, which ran limping about as if with the\npurpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters;\nbut which, in fact, from misapprehension of the swine-herd's signals,\nignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense, only drove them hither\nand thither, and increased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy.\n“A devil draw the teeth of him,” said Gurth, “and the mother of mischief\nconfound the Ranger of the forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs,\nand makes them unfit for their trade! [8] Wamba, up and help me an thou\nbe'st a man; take a turn round the back o' the hill to gain the wind\non them; and when thous't got the weather-gage, thou mayst drive them\nbefore thee as gently as so many innocent lambs.”\n\n“Truly,” said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, “I have consulted\nmy legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion, that\nto carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of\nunfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore,\nGurth, I advise thee to call off Fangs, and leave the herd to their\ndestiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers,\nor of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to\nbe converted into Normans before morning, to thy no small ease and\ncomfort.”\n\n“The swine turned Normans to my comfort!” quoth Gurth; “expound that\nto me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read\nriddles.”\n\n“Why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four\nlegs?” demanded Wamba.\n\n“Swine, fool, swine,” said the herd, “every fool knows that.”\n\n“And swine is good Saxon,” said the Jester; “but how call you the sow\nwhen she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,\nlike a traitor?”\n\n“Pork,” answered the swine-herd.\n\n“I am very glad every fool knows that too,” said Wamba, “and pork, I\nthink, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives, and is in\nthe charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a\nNorman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to\nfeast among the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth, ha?”\n\n“It is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy\nfool's pate.”\n\n“Nay, I can tell you more,” said Wamba, in the same tone; “there is old\nAlderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while he is under the\ncharge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a fiery\nFrench gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are\ndestined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau\nin the like manner; he is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a\nNorman name when he becomes matter of enjoyment.”\n\n“By St Dunstan,” answered Gurth, “thou speakest but sad truths; little\nis left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have been\nreserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to\nendure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The finest and the fattest\nis for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and\nbravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant\nlands with their bones, leaving few here who have either will or the\npower to protect the unfortunate Saxon. God's blessing on our master\nCedric, he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap; but\nReginald Front-de-Boeuf is coming down to this country in person, and we\nshall soon see how little Cedric's trouble will avail him.--Here, here,”\n he exclaimed again, raising his voice, “So ho! so ho! well done, Fangs!\nthou hast them all before thee now, and bring'st them on bravely, lad.”\n\n“Gurth,” said the Jester, “I know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou\nwouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. One word to\nReginald Front-de-Boeuf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast\nspoken treason against the Norman,--and thou art but a cast-away\nswineherd,--thou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all\nevil speakers against dignities.”\n\n“Dog, thou wouldst not betray me,” said Gurth, “after having led me on\nto speak so much at disadvantage?”\n\n“Betray thee!” answered the Jester; “no, that were the trick of a wise\nman; a fool cannot half so well help himself--but soft, whom have we\nhere?” he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which\nbecame then audible.\n\n“Never mind whom,” answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before him,\nand, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim\nvistas which we have endeavoured to describe.\n\n“Nay, but I must see the riders,” answered Wamba; “perhaps they are come\nfrom Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.”\n\n“A murrain take thee,” rejoined the swine-herd; “wilt thou talk of such\nthings, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within\na few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain,\nI never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the\noaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their\ngreat boughs as if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the rational if\nthou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to\nrage, for the night will be fearful.”\n\nWamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his\ncompanion, who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff\nwhich lay upon the grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily\ndown the forest glade, driving before him, with the assistance of Fangs,\nthe whole herd of his inharmonious charge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n     A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,\n     An outrider that loved venerie;\n     A manly man, to be an Abbot able,\n     Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:\n     And whan he rode, men might his bridle hear\n     Gingeling in a whistling wind as clear,\n     And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,\n     There as this lord was keeper of the cell.\n     --Chaucer.\n\nNotwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion,\nthe noise of the horsemen's feet continuing to approach, Wamba could\nnot be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every\npretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of\nhalf-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden\nwho crossed their path. The horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on\nthe road.\n\nTheir numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost\nseemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others\ntheir attendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and\ncharacter of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic\nof high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of\nmaterials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted.\nHis mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample,\nand not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent\nperson. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his\nhabit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have\nbeen called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye,\nthat sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary.\nIn other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready\ncommand over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into\nsolemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured\nsocial indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of\npopes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned\nup with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden\nclasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and\nornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while\nshe retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its\nsimplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them,\na certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the\nvanities of the world.\n\nThis worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture\nwas highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the\nday, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the\nawkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of\na well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance\nas a mule, in however good case, and however well broken to a pleasant\nand accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for\ntravelling on the road. A lay brother, one of those who followed in the\ntrain, had, for his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome\nSpanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that\ntime to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of\nwealth and distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey\nwere covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground,\nand on which were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other\necclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded\nprobably with his superior's baggage; and two monks of his own order,\nof inferior station, rode together in the rear, laughing and conversing\nwith each other, without taking much notice of the other members of the\ncavalcade.\n\nThe companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin,\nstrong, tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and\nconstant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the\nhuman form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which\nhad sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more.\nHis head was covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur--of that kind\nwhich the French call “mortier”, from its resemblance to the shape of an\ninverted mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its\nexpression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of\nfear, upon strangers. High features, naturally strong and powerfully\nexpressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant\nexposure to the tropical sun, and might, in their ordinary state, be\nsaid to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the\nprojection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which the\nupper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest\nemotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily\nawakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history\nof difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge\nopposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road\nby a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow\ngave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinister expression\nto one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the same\noccasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a slight and\npartial degree distorted.\n\nThe upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in\nshape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet,\nshowed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of\nmonks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white\ncloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at\nfirst view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely, of\nlinked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and\ninterwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought in\nthe stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of his\nthighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen, were\nalso covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by\nsplints, or thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each\nother; and mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually\nprotected the legs, and completed the rider's defensive armour. In\nhis girdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only\noffensive weapon about his person.\n\nHe rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the\nroad, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully\naccoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his\nhead, having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of the\nsaddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving;\non the other the rider's plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long\ntwo-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire\nheld aloft his master's lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a\nsmall banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that\nembroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular\nshield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence\ndiminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which\nprevented the device from being seen.\n\nThese two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages,\nwhite turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to\nbe natives of some distant Eastern country. [9]\n\nThe whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and\noutlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern\nattendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the\nsame metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former were\nnaked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and\nembroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and\nimportance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking\ncontrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed\nwith crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and\nmatched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of\nthem bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four\nfeet in length, having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among\nthe Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial\nexercise called “El Jerrid”, still practised in the Eastern countries.\n\nThe steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their\nriders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian\ndescent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and\neasy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed,\nheavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in\nNormandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply\nof plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern\ncoursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of\nshadow.\n\nThe singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the\ncuriosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile\ncompanion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx\nAbbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of\nthe banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures\nstill more inconsistent with his monastic vows.\n\nYet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the\nclergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a\nfair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial\ntemper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all\nordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and\nprincipal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of\na distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not\ndisposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed\nadmirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the\nennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an\nancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with\nmore than due eagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained\nhawks, and the fleetest greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances\nwhich strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry. With the old,\nhe had another part to play, which, when needful, he could sustain\nwith great decorum. His knowledge of books, however superficial, was\nsufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed\nlearning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high\ntone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church\nand of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his\nsanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of\ntheir betters, had commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He\nwas generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a multitude\nof sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in\nScripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at\nhis disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very\nconsiderable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed\namong the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the\ndistresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or\nremained long at the banquet,--if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early\npeep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home\nfrom some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men\nonly shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his\nirregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many\nof his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for\nthem. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to\nour Saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his\n“benedicite, mes filz,” in return.\n\nBut the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants,\narrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could\nscarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulx' question, when he demanded if\nthey knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they\nsurprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy\nstranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants.\nIt is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was\nconferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious, though not\nprobably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.\n\n“I asked you, my children,” said the Prior, raising his voice, and using\nthe lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon\nraces conversed with each other, “if there be in this neighbourhood any\ngood man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church,\nwill give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a night's\nhospitality and refreshment?”\n\nThis he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong\ncontrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.\n\n“Two of the humblest servants of Mother Church!” repeated Wamba to\nhimself,--but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation\naudible; “I should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and\nother principal domestics!”\n\nAfter this internal commentary on the Prior's speech, he raised his\neyes, and replied to the question which had been put.\n\n“If the reverend fathers,” he said, “loved good cheer and soft lodging,\nfew miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where\ntheir quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception;\nor if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn\ndown yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of\nCopmanhurst, where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the\nnight of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers.”\n\nThe Prior shook his head at both proposals.\n\n“Mine honest friend,” said he, “if the jangling of thy bells had not\ndizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know “Clericus clericum non\ndecimat”; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other's\nhospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus\nan opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed\nservants.”\n\n“It is true,” replied Wamba, “that I, being but an ass, am,\nnevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence's\nmule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church\nand her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.”\n\n“A truce to thine insolence, fellow,” said the armed rider, breaking in\non his prattle with a high and stern voice, “and tell us, if thou canst,\nthe road to--How call'd you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?”\n\n“Cedric,” answered the Prior; “Cedric the Saxon.--Tell me, good fellow,\nare we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?”\n\n“The road will be uneasy to find,” answered Gurth, who broke silence for\nthe first time, “and the family of Cedric retire early to rest.”\n\n“Tush, tell not me, fellow,” said the military rider; “'tis easy for\nthem to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who\nwill not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.”\n\n“I know not,” said Gurth, sullenly, “if I should show the way to my\nmaster's house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most\nare fain to ask as a favour.”\n\n“Do you dispute with me, slave!” said the soldier; and, setting spurs\nto his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at\nthe same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose\nof chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.\n\nGurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,\nyet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the\ninterference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion\nand the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.\n\n“Nay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in\nPalestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we\nislanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom\nshe loveth.--Tell me, good fellow,” said he to Wamba, and seconded his\nspeech by a small piece of silver coin, “the way to Cedric the Saxon's;\nyou cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the wanderer\neven when his character is less sanctified than ours.”\n\n“In truth, venerable father,” answered the Jester, “the Saracen head of\nyour right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home--I\nam not sure I shall get there to-night myself.”\n\n“Tush,” said the Abbot, “thou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend\nbrother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens\nfor the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights\nTemplars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a\nsoldier.”\n\n“If he is but half a monk,” said the Jester, “he should not be wholly\nunreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should\nbe in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.”\n\n“I forgive thy wit,” replied the Abbot, “on condition thou wilt show me\nthe way to Cedric's mansion.”\n\n“Well, then,” answered Wamba, “your reverences must hold on this path\ntill you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit's length\nremains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are\nfour which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain\nshelter before the storm comes on.”\n\nThe Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to\ntheir horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the\nbursting of a night-storm. As their horses' hoofs died away, Gurth\nsaid to his companion, “If they follow thy wise direction, the reverend\nfathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.”\n\n“No,” said the Jester, grinning, “but they may reach Sheffield if they\nhave good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a\nwoodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he\nshould chase him.”\n\n“Thou art right,” said Gurth; “it were ill that Aymer saw the Lady\nRowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most\nlikely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us\nhear and see, and say nothing.”\n\nWe return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind\nthem, and who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French\nlanguage, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception\nof the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.\n\n“What mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?” said the\nTemplar to the Benedictine, “and why did you prevent me from chastising\nit?”\n\n“Marry, brother Brian,” replied the Prior, “touching the one of them, it\nwere hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his\nfolly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race,\nsome of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the\ndescendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is\nto testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their\nconquerors.”\n\n“I would soon have beat him into courtesy,” observed Brian; “I am\naccustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as fierce\nand intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my\nhousehold, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made\nthem humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry,\nsir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either\nwith free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.”\n\n“Ay, but,” answered Prior Aymer, “every land has its own manners and\nfashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no\ninformation respecting the road to Cedric's house, it would have been\nsure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our\nway thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,\nfierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even\nof his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are\nno babies to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of\nhis race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a\nrenowned champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric\nthe Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom\nmany others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a\nshare of the 'vae victis,' or severities imposed upon the vanquished.”\n\n“Prior Aymer,” said the Templar, “you are a man of gallantry, learned\nin the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters\nconcerning the 'arrets' of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this\ncelebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance\nwhich I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl\nas you have described her father Cedric.”\n\n“Cedric is not her father,” replied the Prior, “and is but of remote\nrelation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to,\nand is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however,\nhe is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as\nif she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if\nthe purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a\nmild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of\nPalestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahound's paradise, I am an infidel,\nand no true son of the church.”\n\n“Should your boasted beauty,” said the Templar, “be weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting, you know our wager?”\n\n“My gold collar,” answered the Prior, “against ten butts of Chian\nwine;--they are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent\nvaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.”\n\n“And I am myself to be judge,” said the Templar, “and am only to be\nconvicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful\nsince Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?--Prior, your collar\nis in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of\nAshby-de-la-Zouche.”\n\n“Win it fairly,” said the Prior, “and wear it as ye will; I will trust\nyour giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman.\nYet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more\ncourtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives\nand Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if\noffended,--and he is noway slack in taking offence,--is a man who,\nwithout respect to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity\nof either, would clear his house of us, and send us to lodge with the\nlarks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on\nRowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care; an he take the\nleast alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished\nhis only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of\naffection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a\ndistance, but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as\nwe bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.”\n\n“Well, you have said enough,” answered the Templar; “I will for a night\nput on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but\nas for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires,\nwith Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt\nnot that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.”\n\n“We must not let it come so far,” answered the Prior; “but here is the\nclown's sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see\nwhich of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the\nleft.”\n\n“To the right,” said Brian, “to the best of my remembrance.”\n\n“To the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his\nwooden sword.”\n\n“Ay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his\nbody with it,” said the Templar.\n\nEach maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in\nall such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been\nnear enough to hear Wamba's directions. At length Brian remarked, what\nhad at first escaped him in the twilight; “Here is some one either\nasleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross--Hugo, stir him with the\nbutt-end of thy lance.”\n\nThis was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good\nFrench, “Whosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my\nthoughts.”\n\n“We did but wish to ask you,” said the Prior, “the road to Rotherwood,\nthe abode of Cedric the Saxon.”\n\n“I myself am bound thither,” replied the stranger; “and if I had a\nhorse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though\nperfectly well known to me.”\n\n“Thou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,” said the Prior, “if\nthou wilt bring us to Cedric's in safety.”\n\nAnd he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give\nthat upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve\nfor a guide.\n\nTheir conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had\nrecommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led\ndeeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach\nto which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed;\nbut the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground\nand the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention,\nbrought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet\nseen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper\nextremity, he said to the Prior, “Yonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of\nCedric the Saxon.”\n\nThis was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the\nstrongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course\nof passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the\ncuriosity to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at his\nease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of\nthe guide who and what he was.\n\n“A Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,” was the answer.\n\n“You had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy\nSepulchre,” said the Templar.\n\n“True, Reverend Sir Knight,” answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance\nof the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; “but when those who are under\noath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance\nfrom the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant\nlike me should decline the task which they have abandoned?”\n\nThe Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the\nPrior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after\nsuch long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of\nthe forest.\n\n“I was born a native of these parts,” answered their guide, and as he\nmade the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;--a low irregular\nbuilding, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over\na considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the\ninhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,\nturretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility\nresided, and which had become the universal style of architecture\nthroughout England.\n\nRotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in\nthat disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being\nplundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch,\nwas drawn round the whole building, and filled with water from a\nneighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed\nbeams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner\nbank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west through the\nouter stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a similar\nopening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to\nplace those entrances under the protection of projecting angles, by\nwhich they might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers.\n\nBefore this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain,\nwhich had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n     Then (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears\n     The German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,\n     And yellow hair'd, the blue-eyed Saxon came.\n     Thomson's Liberty\n\nIn a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its\nextreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks\nrough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish,\nstood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof,\ncomposed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from\nthe sky excepting the planking and thatch; there was a huge fireplace at\neither end of the hall, but as the chimneys were constructed in a very\nclumsy manner, at least as much of the smoke found its way into the\napartment as escaped by the proper vent. The constant vapour which this\noccasioned, had polished the rafters and beams of the low-browed hall,\nby encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the sides of the\napartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there were at\neach corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the\nextensive building.\n\nThe other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity\nof the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining.\nThe floor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard\nsubstance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For\nabout one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised\nby a step, and this space, which was called the dais, was occupied only\nby the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction.\nFor this purpose, a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed\ntransversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the\nlonger and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior persons fed,\ndown towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form of the\nletter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the\nsame principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or\nCambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the\ndais, and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a\ncanopy of cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries\nwho occupied that distinguished station from the weather, and\nespecially from the rain, which in some places found its way through the\nill-constructed roof.\n\nThe walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended,\nwere covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a\ncarpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or\nembroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the\nlower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering;\nthe rough plastered walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was\nuncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches\nsupplied the place of chairs.\n\nIn the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated\nthan the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided\nover the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon\ntitle of honour, which signifies “the Dividers of Bread.”\n\nTo each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and\ninlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One\nof these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though\nbut in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at\nthe delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have\nbecome an alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.\n\nIt appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he\nwas of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the\nmiddle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made,\nlike one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his\nface was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine\nteeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of\ngood-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and\njealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been spent in asserting\nrights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, fiery,\nand resolute disposition of the man, had been kept constantly upon the\nalert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was\nequally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed\ndown on each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little\ntendency to grey, although Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.\n\nHis dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs\nwith what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to\nermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel.\nThis doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat\ntight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach\nbelow the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His\nfeet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of finer\nmaterials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had bracelets\nof gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal\naround his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in\nwhich was stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so\ndisposed as to hang almost perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat\nwas hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same\nmaterials richly embroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent\nlandholder when he chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad\nand bright steel head, also reclined against the back of his chair,\nwhich served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or\nof a weapon, as chance might require.\n\nSeveral domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the\nrichness of their master's, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth\nthe swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon\ndignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their\nmaster upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall.\nOther attendants there were of a different description; two or three\nlarge and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the\nstag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick\nnecks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs,\nnow called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the\nsupper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to\ntheir race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master,\napprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric's\ntrencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged\ndependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an\nindulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and\noccasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head\nupon his master's knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was\nrepelled by the stern command, “Down, Balder, down! I am not in the\nhumour for foolery.”\n\nIn fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of\nmind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at\na distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,\nwhich had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of\nGurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from\nthe forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it\nprobable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the\noutlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence\nof some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made\nhim equally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of\nconsequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon\nproprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in\nforest-land, where those animals easily found their food.\n\nBesides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the\npresence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were,\nserved for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep\ndraughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying\nit. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper\nhour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires,\nboth in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in\nbroken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the\ndomestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who\noffered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled\nwith wine--“Why tarries the Lady Rowena?”\n\n“She is but changing her head-gear,” replied a female attendant, with as\nmuch confidence as the favourite lady's-maid usually answers the master\nof a modern family; “you would not wish her to sit down to the banquet\nin her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in\narraying herself than my mistress.”\n\nThis undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the\npart of the Saxon, with the addition, “I wish her devotion may choose\nfair weather for the next visit to St John's Kirk;--but what, in the\nname of ten devils,” continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising\nhis voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert\nhis indignation without fear or control--“what, in the name of ten\ndevils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil\naccount of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge,\nand I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have\nmade him one of my warders.” [11]\n\nOswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, “that it was scarce an hour\nsince the tolling of the curfew;” an ill-chosen apology, since it turned\nupon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.\n\n“The foul fiend,” exclaimed Cedric, “take the curfew-bell, and the\ntyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who\nnames it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!” he added,\npausing, “ay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their\nlights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!--Ay,\nthe curfew;--Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the\nuse of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e'er a\nNorman adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess,\nthat my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry\nbanditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful\nslave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and Wamba--where\nis Wamba? Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?”\n\nOswald replied in the affirmative.\n\n“Ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon\nfool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them,\nand fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born\nwith but half our wits. But I will be avenged,” he added, starting from\nhis chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his\nboar-spear; “I will go with my complaint to the great council; I have\nfriends, I have followers--man to man will I appeal the Norman to the\nlists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can render\ncowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger\nfence than three of their war shields!--Haply they think me old; but\nthey shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is\nin the veins of Cedric.--Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!” he exclaimed in a lower\ntone, “couldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father\nhad not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out\nits shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the\ntempest!” The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated\nfeelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks\ndownward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.\n\nFrom his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn,\nwhich was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs\nin the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other\nparts of the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon,\nwell seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine\nclamour.\n\n“To the gate, knaves!” said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult\nwas so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. “See what\ntidings that horn tells us of--to announce, I ween, some hership [12]\nand robbery which has been done upon my lands.”\n\nReturning in less than three minutes, a warder announced “that the Prior\nAymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander\nof the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small\nretinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on\ntheir way to a tournament which was to be held not far from\nAshby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from the present.”\n\n“Aymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”--muttered Cedric;\n“Normans both;--but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood must\nnot be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt--more\nwelcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way--But it\nwere unworthy to murmur for a night's lodging and a night's food; in\nthe quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their\ninsolence.--Go, Hundebert,” he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood\nbehind him with a white wand; “take six of the attendants, and introduce\nthe strangers to the guests' lodging. Look after their horses and mules,\nand see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of vestments if\nthey require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and ale; and bid\nthe cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and let it\nbe put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say to\nthem, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is\nunder a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own\nhall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see\nthem carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl\nhas shown at once his poverty and his avarice.”\n\nThe major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his master's\ncommands.\n\n“The Prior Aymer!” repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, “the brother, if\nI mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?”\n\nOswald made a respectful sign of assent. “His brother sits in the\nseat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of\nMiddleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they\nsay, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn\nbetter than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How\nnamed ye the Templar?”\n\n“Brian de Bois-Guilbert.”\n\n“Bois-Guilbert,” said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,\nwhich the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,\nand which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those\naround him--“Bois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for\ngood and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;\nbut stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and\nvoluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,\nnor awe of heaven. So say the few warriors who have returned from\nPalestine.--Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome\ntoo.--Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the\nmightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most\nodoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns [13]\n--Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure.--Elgitha, let\nthy Lady Rowena, know we shall not this night expect her in the hall,\nunless such be her especial pleasure.”\n\n“But it will be her especial pleasure,” answered Elgitha, with great\nreadiness, “for she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from\nPalestine.”\n\nCedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but\nRowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from\nhis anger. He only replied, “Silence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy\ndiscretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure.\nHere, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.”\n Elgitha left the apartment.\n\n“Palestine!” repeated the Saxon; “Palestine! how many ears are turned\nto the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring\nfrom that fatal land! I too might ask--I too might enquire--I too might\nlisten with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise\nto cheat us into hospitality--but no--The son who has disobeyed me is no\nlonger mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that\nof the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on\ntheir shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it\nan accomplishment of the will of God.”\n\nHe knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as\nhe raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast\nwide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics\nbearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the\napartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n     With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,\n     And the proud steer was on the marble spread;\n     With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,\n     Wine rosy bright the brimming goblets crown'd.\n     * * * * *\n     Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;\n     A trivet table and ignobler seat,\n     The Prince assigns--\n     --Odyssey, Book XXI\n\nThe Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his\nriding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore\na cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring,\nwhich marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary\nto the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the\nfinest leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as\nsmall dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven\ncrown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.\n\nThe appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though\nless studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and\nhis appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had\nexchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk,\ngarnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white,\nin ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the\nshoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested\nhis brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of\na raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion.\nNothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner,\nhad they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily\nacquired by the exercise of unresisted authority.\n\nThese two dignified persons were followed by their respective\nattendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure\nhad nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a\npilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole\nbody. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar,\nhaving similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a “Sclaveyn”,\nor “Sclavonian”. Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet;\na broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and\na long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a\nbranch of palm, completed the palmer's attire. He followed modestly the\nlast of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower\ntable scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of Cedric and\nthe retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and\nalmost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in\ndrying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room\nat the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with\nrefreshments in the place he had chosen apart.\n\nCedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality,\nand, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three\nsteps towards them, and then awaited their approach.\n\n“I grieve,” he said, “reverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance\nno farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests\nas you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has\nexpounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray,\nthat you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that\nyou will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I\nsufficiently understand Norman to follow your meaning.”\n\n“Vows,” said the Abbot, “must be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit\nme rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows\nare the knots which tie us to Heaven--they are the cords which bind\nthe sacrifice to the horns of the altar,--and are therefore,--as I said\nbefore,--to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church\nshall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly\nhold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda\nof Middleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may\npresume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of\nWhitby, God be gracious to her soul!”\n\nWhen the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue,\nhis companion said briefly and emphatically, “I speak ever French,\nthe language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English\nsufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country.”\n\nCedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,\nwhich comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call\nforth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed\nfurther show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his\nguests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close\nbeside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed\nupon the board.\n\nWhile the attendants hastened to obey Cedric's commands, his eye\ndistinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had\njust entered the hall. “Send these loitering knaves up hither,” said the\nSaxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the dais,--“How\ncomes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast\nthou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou left them to\nrobbers and marauders?”\n\n“The herd is safe, so please ye,” said Gurth.\n\n“But it does not please me, thou knave,” said Cedric, “that I should be\nmade to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising vengeance\nagainst my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee,\nshackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this\nkind.”\n\nGurth, knowing his master's irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;\nbut the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric's tolerance, by virtue\nof his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; “In troth, uncle\nCedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.”\n\n“'How, sir?” said his master; “you shall to the porter's lodge, and\ntaste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.”\n\n“First let your wisdom tell me,” said Wamba, “is it just and reasonable\nto punish one person for the fault of another?”\n\n“Certainly not, fool,” answered Cedric.\n\n“Then why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog\nFangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had\ngot our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the\nvesper-bell.”\n\n“Then hang up Fangs,” said Cedric, turning hastily towards the\nswineherd, “if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.”\n\n“Under favour, uncle,” said the Jester, “that were still somewhat on the\nbow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was lame\nand could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off\ntwo of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had\nbeen consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.”\n\n“And who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?” said\nthe Saxon, kindling in wrath.\n\n“Marry, that did old Hubert,” said Wamba, “Sir Philip de Malvoisin's\nkeeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said\nhe chased the deer contrary to his master's right, as warden of the\nwalk.”\n\n“The foul fiend take Malvoisin,” answered the Saxon, “and his keeper\nboth! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of\nthe great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy\nplace--and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare\nto touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head,\nif I strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!--he shall draw\nbowstring no more.--I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset\nhere with neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land.\nBut your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends\nfor hard fare.”\n\nThe feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies\nfrom the lord of the mansion. Swine's flesh, dressed in several modes,\nappeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer,\ngoats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves\nand cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey.\nThe smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were\nnot served up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or\nbroaches, and offered by the pages and domestics who bore them, to each\nguest in succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased.\nBeside each person of rank was placed a goblet of silver; the lower\nboard was accommodated with large drinking horns.\n\nWhen the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward,\nsuddenly raising his wand, said aloud,--“Forbear!--Place for the Lady\nRowena.”\n\nA side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet\ntable, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the\napartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether\nagreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion, hastened\nto meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the\nelevated seat at his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of the\nmansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by\na mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her\nplace at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to\nthe Prior, “I shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament.\nThe Chian wine is your own.”\n\n“Said I not so?” answered the Prior; “but check your raptures, the\nFranklin observes you.”\n\nUnheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the\nimmediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept\nhis eyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his\nimagination, because differing widely from those of the Eastern\nsultanas.\n\nFormed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature,\nyet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior\nheight. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her\nhead and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches\nto fair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a\ngraceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the\nforehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well\nas to beseech. If mildness were the more natural expression of such a\ncombination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance, the\nexercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general homage,\nhad given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and\nqualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt\nbrown and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in\nnumerous ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These\nlocks were braided with gems, and, being worn at full length, intimated\nthe noble birth and free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain,\nto which was attached a small reliquary of the same metal, hung round\nher neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which were bare. Her dress was\nan under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green silk, over which hung a long\nloose robe, which reached to the ground, having very wide sleeves, which\ncame down, however, very little below the elbow. This robe was crimson,\nand manufactured out of the very finest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven\nwith gold, was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at\nthe wearer's pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom after the\nSpanish fashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders.\n\nWhen Rowena perceived the Knight Templar's eyes bent on her with an\nardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved,\ngave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil\naround her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of his\nglance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. “Sir\nTemplar,” said he, “the cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little\nof the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader.”\n\n“If I have offended,” replied Sir Brian, “I crave your pardon,--that\nis, I crave the Lady Rowena's pardon,--for my humility will carry me no\nlower.”\n\n“The Lady Rowena,” said the Prior, “has punished us all, in chastising\nthe boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the\nsplendid train which are to meet at the tournament.”\n\n“Our going thither,” said Cedric, “is uncertain. I love not these\nvanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free.”\n\n“Let us hope, nevertheless,” said the Prior, “our company may determine\nyou to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of\nSir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.”\n\n“Sir Prior,” answered the Saxon, “wheresoever I have travelled in this\nland, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword\nand faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At present,\nif we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my noble\nneighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a\ntrain as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.--I drink\nto you, Sir Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will\napprove, and I thank you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid\nin adhering to monastic rule,” he added, “as to prefer your acid\npreparation of milk, I hope you will not strain courtesy to do me\nreason.”\n\n“Nay,” said the Priest, laughing, “it is only in our abbey that we\nconfine ourselves to the 'lac dulce' or the 'lac acidum' either.\nConversing with, the world, we use the world's fashions, and therefore\nI answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the weaker liquor to\nmy lay-brother.”\n\n“And I,” said the Templar, filling his goblet, “drink wassail to the\nfair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England,\nhas never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could\npardon the unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now witness,\nfor making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.”\n\n“I will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,” said Rowena with dignity, and\nwithout unveiling herself; “or rather I will tax it so far as to require\nof you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our\nEnglish ears than the compliments which your French breeding teaches.”\n\n“I have little of importance to say, lady,” answered Sir Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, “excepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with\nSaladin.”\n\nHe was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon\na chair, the back of which was decorated with two ass's ears, and which\nwas placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time\nto time, supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour,\nhowever, which the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we\nhave already noticed, there were several in attendance. Here sat Wamba,\nwith a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of\nthe chair, his cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble a pair\nof nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with alertness\nevery opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery.\n\n“These truces with the infidels,” he exclaimed, without caring how\nsuddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, “make an old man of me!”\n\n“Go to, knave, how so?” said Cedric, his features prepared to receive\nfavourably the expected jest.\n\n“Because,” answered Wamba, “I remember three of them in my day, each\nof which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by\ncomputation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.”\n\n“I will warrant you against dying of old age, however,” said the\nTemplar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; “I will assure\nyou from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to\nwayfarers, as you did this night to the Prior and me.”\n\n“How, sirrah!” said Cedric, “misdirect travellers? We must have you\nwhipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool.”\n\n“I pray thee, uncle,” answered the Jester, “let my folly, for once,\nprotect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and\nmy left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his\ncounsellor and guide.”\n\nConversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter's\npage, who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring\nadmittance and hospitality.\n\n“Admit him,” said Cedric, “be he who or what he may;--a night like that\nwhich roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and to\nseek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by\nthe elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care--look to it,\nOswald.”\n\nAnd the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his\npatron obeyed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n  Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,\n  senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with\n  the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the\n  same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as\n  a Christian is?\n  --Merchant of Venice\n\nOswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, “It is a Jew,\nwho calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into\nthe hall?”\n\n“Let Gurth do thine office, Oswald,” said Wamba with his usual\neffrontery; “the swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew.”\n\n“St Mary,” said the Abbot, crossing himself, “an unbelieving Jew, and\nadmitted into this presence!”\n\n“A dog Jew,” echoed the Templar, “to approach a defender of the Holy\nSepulchre?”\n\n“By my faith,” said Wamba, “it would seem the Templars love the Jews'\ninheritance better than they do their company.”\n\n“Peace, my worthy guests,” said Cedric; “my hospitality must not be\nbounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of\nstiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may\nendure the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no man\nto converse or to feed with him.--Let him have a board and a morsel\napart,--unless,” he said smiling, “these turban'd strangers will admit\nhis society.”\n\n“Sir Franklin,” answered the Templar, “my Saracen slaves are true\nMoslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a\nJew.”\n\n“Now, in faith,” said Wamba, “I cannot see that the worshippers of\nMahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people\nonce chosen of Heaven.”\n\n“He shall sit with thee, Wamba,” said Cedric; “the fool and the knave\nwill be well met.”\n\n“The fool,” answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon,\n“will take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.”\n\n“Hush,” said Cedric, “for here he comes.”\n\nIntroduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation,\nand many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who, however, had\nlost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the\nlower end of the board. His features, keen and regular, with an aquiline\nnose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long\ngrey hair and beard, would have been considered as handsome, had they\nnot been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race, which, during\nthose dark ages, was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced\nvulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility, and who,\nperhaps, owing to that very hatred and persecution, had adopted a\nnational character, in which there was much, to say the least, mean and\nunamiable.\n\nThe Jew's dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the\nstorm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple\ntunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his\nwaist, which sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing\nmaterials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar\nfashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish them from Christians, and\nwhich he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.\n\nThe reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such\nas might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of\nIsrael. Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew's repeated\nsalutations, and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the\ntable, where, however, no one offered to make room for him. On the\ncontrary, as he passed along the file, casting a timid supplicating\nglance, and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of\nthe board, the Saxon domestics squared their shoulders, and continued\nto devour their supper with great perseverance, paying not the least\nattention to the wants of the new guest. The attendants of the Abbot\ncrossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen\nSaracens, as Isaac drew near them, curled up their whiskers with\nindignation, and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to\nrid themselves by the most desperate means from the apprehended\ncontamination of his nearer approach.\n\nProbably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this\nson of a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants\nreceiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment,\nengaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character\nof his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for matters\nof much greater importance than that of a Jew going to bed supperless.\nWhile Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society, like his\npeople among the nations, looking in vain for welcome or resting\nplace, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him, and\nresigned his seat, saying briefly, “Old man, my garments are dried,\nmy hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting.” So saying, he\ngathered together, and brought to a flame, the decaying brands which\nlay scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger board a mess of\npottage and seethed kid, placed it upon the small table at which he had\nhimself supped, and, without waiting the Jew's thanks, went to the\nother side of the hall;--whether from unwillingness to hold more close\ncommunication with the object of his benevolence, or from a wish to draw\nnear to the upper end of the table, seemed uncertain.\n\nHad there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject,\nthe Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his chilled and\ntrembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical\npersonification of the Winter season. Having dispelled the cold, he\nturned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and\nate with a haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to betoken long\nabstinence from food.\n\nMeanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting;\nthe Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant\nfemales; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to\nthe Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to\ninterest him.\n\n“I marvel, worthy Cedric,” said the Abbot, as their discourse proceeded,\n“that, great as your predilection is for your own manly language, you do\nnot receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at least as the\nmystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely no tongue is so\nrich in the various phrases which the field-sports demand, or furnishes\nmeans to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art.”\n\n“Good Father Aymer,” said the Saxon, “be it known to you, I care not\nfor those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take my\npleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast\neither a 'recheate' or a 'morte'--I can cheer my dogs on the prey, and\nI can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without using\nthe newfangled jargon of 'curee, arbor, nombles', and all the babble of\nthe fabulous Sir Tristrem.” [14]\n\n“The French,” said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous\nand authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, “is not only\nthe natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in which\nladies should be won and enemies defied.”\n\n“Pledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,” said Cedric, “and fill\nanother to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you\nanother tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale\nneeded no garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear\nof beauty; and the field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy\nStandard, could tell whether the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far\nwithin the ranks of the Scottish host as the 'cri de guerre' of\nthe boldest Norman baron. To the memory of the brave who fought\nthere!--Pledge me, my guests.” He drank deep, and went on with\nincreasing warmth. “Ay, that was a day of cleaving of shields, when a\nhundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and\nblood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight.\nA Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords--a gathering of the\neagles to the prey--the clashing of bills upon shield and helmet, the\nshouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our\nbards are no more,” he said; “our deeds are lost in those of another\nrace--our language--our very name--is hastening to decay, and none\nmourns for it save one solitary old man--Cupbearer! knave, fill the\ngoblets--To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language\nwhat it will, who now bear them best in Palestine among the champions of\nthe Cross!”\n\n“It becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,” said Sir Brian de\nBois-Guilbert; “yet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy\nSepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?”\n\n“To the Knights Hospitallers,” said the Abbot; “I have a brother of\ntheir order.”\n\n“I impeach not their fame,” said the Templar; “nevertheless---”\n\n“I think, friend Cedric,” said Wamba, interfering, “that had Richard\nof the Lion's Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool's advice,\nhe might have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the\nrecovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the\nloss of it.”\n\n“Were there, then, none in the English army,” said the Lady Rowena,\n“whose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple,\nand of St John?”\n\n“Forgive me, lady,” replied De Bois-Guilbert; “the English monarch did,\nindeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to\nthose whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed\nland.”\n\n“Second to NONE,” said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear,\nand had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All turned\ntoward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.\n\n“I say,” repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice, “that the\nEnglish chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in defence of\nthe Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself,\nand five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St\nJohn-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that\nday, each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three\nantagonists. I add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the\nTemple--and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I\ntell you.”\n\nIt is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage\nwhich rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In the\nextremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped\ntowards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the\nconsciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that\nplace and presence. Cedric, whose feelings were all of a right onward\nand simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one object at\nonce, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of\nhis countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; “I would\ngive thee this golden bracelet, Pilgrim,” he said, “couldst thou tell me\nthe names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry\nEngland.”\n\n“That will I do blithely,” replied the Pilgrim, “and without guerdon; my\noath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.”\n\n“I will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,” said\nWamba.\n\n“The first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,” said the\nPilgrim, “was the brave Richard, King of England.”\n\n“I forgive him,” said Cedric; “I forgive him his descent from the tyrant\nDuke William.”\n\n“The Earl of Leicester was the second,” continued the Pilgrim; “Sir\nThomas Multon of Gilsland was the third.”\n\n“Of Saxon descent, he at least,” said Cedric, with exultation.\n\n“Sir Foulk Doilly the fourth,” proceeded the Pilgrim.\n\n“Saxon also, at least by the mother's side,” continued Cedric, who\nlistened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his\nhatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and\nhis islanders. “And who was the fifth?” he demanded.\n\n“The fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham.”\n\n“Genuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!” shouted Cedric--“And the\nsixth?” he continued with eagerness--“how name you the sixth?”\n\n“The sixth,” said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to\nrecollect himself, “was a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,\nassumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than\nto make up their number--his name dwells not in my memory.”\n\n“Sir Palmer,” said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, “this assumed\nforgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to\nserve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before\nwhose lance fortune and my horse's fault occasioned my falling--it was\nthe Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years,\nhad more renown in arms.--Yet this will I say, and loudly--that were he\nin England, and durst repeat, in this week's tournament, the challenge\nof St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would give him\nevery advantage of weapons, and abide the result.”\n\n“Your challenge would soon be answered,” replied the Palmer, “were your\nantagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall\nwith vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot\ntake place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his surety\nthat he meets you.”\n\n“A goodly security!” said the Knight Templar; “and what do you proffer\nas a pledge?”\n\n“This reliquary,” said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his\nbosom, and crossing himself, “containing a portion of the true cross,\nbrought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.”\n\nThe Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in\nwhich all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the\nTemplar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying\nany reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck\na gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying--“Let Prior Aymer\nhold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the\nKnight of Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies\nthe challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, which, if he answer not, I will\nproclaim him as a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in Europe.”\n\n“It will not need,” said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; “My voice\nshall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the\nabsent Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge.\nCould my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this\nholy pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud\nknight the meeting he desires.”\n\nA crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and\nkept him silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment,\nembarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the\nshadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants,\non whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost\nelectrical, hung in suspense upon their master's looks. But when Rowena\nspoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.\n\n“Lady,” said Cedric, “this beseems not; were further pledge necessary, I\nmyself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my honour\nfor the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even\naccording to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry--Is it not,\nFather Aymer?”\n\n“It is,” replied the Prior; “and the blessed relic and rich chain will I\nbestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision of this\nwarlike challenge.”\n\nHaving thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after\nmany genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to\nBrother Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less\nceremony, but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden\nchain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which\nopened under his arm. “And now, Sir Cedric,” he said, “my ears are\nchiming vespers with the strength of your good wine--permit us another\npledge to the welfare of the Lady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to\npass to our repose.”\n\n“By the rood of Bromholme,” said the Saxon, “you do but small credit to\nyour fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear\nthe matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to\nhave shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of twelve,\nin my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.”\n\nThe Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course\nof temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional\npeacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was\nnot altogether from a love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from\na mixture of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive\napprehension of the fiery temper of the Saxon, and saw the danger that\nthe reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had\nalready given so many proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable\nexplosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native\nof any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl\nwith the hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but\nslightly, about his own holy character, and ended by pressing his\nproposal to depart to repose.\n\nThe grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making\ndeep obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose and\nmingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors,\nretired with their attendants.\n\n“Unbelieving dog,” said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him\nin the throng, “dost thou bend thy course to the tournament?”\n\n“I do so propose,” replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, “if it please\nyour reverend valour.”\n\n“Ay,” said the Knight, “to gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury,\nand to gull women and boys with gauds and toys--I warrant thee store of\nshekels in thy Jewish scrip.”\n\n“Not a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling--so help me the God\nof Abraham!” said the Jew, clasping his hands; “I go but to seek the\nassistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which\nthe Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me--Father Jacob be my\nspeed! I am an impoverished wretch--the very gaberdine I wear is\nborrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster.” [15]\n\nThe Templar smiled sourly as he replied, “Beshrew thee for a\nfalse-hearted liar!” and passing onward, as if disdaining farther\nconference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to\nthe bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address\nof the military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity\nof the hall ere he raised his head from the humble posture which he had\nassumed, so far as to be sensible of his departure. And when he did\nlook around, it was with the astonished air of one at whose feet a\nthunderbolt has just burst, and who hears still the astounding report\nringing in his ears.\n\nThe Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping\napartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two\ntorchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of\ninferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests\ntheir respective places of repose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n     To buy his favour I extend this friendship:\n     If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;\n     And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.\n     --Merchant of Venice\n\nAs the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the\nintricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion,\nthe cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had\nno objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were many\ndomestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought\nfrom the Holy Land, and particularly that which concerned the Knight of\nIvanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing\nthat a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew. Without\ndisputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer thanked them\nfor their courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious\nvow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were\nprohibited in the hall. “That vow,” said Wamba to the cupbearer, “would\nscarce suit a serving-man.”\n\nThe cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. “I thought to\nhave lodged him in the solere chamber,” said he; “but since he is so\nunsocial to Christians, e'en let him take the next stall to Isaac the\nJew's.--Anwold,” said he to the torchbearer, “carry the Pilgrim to the\nsouthern cell.--I give you good-night,” he added, “Sir Palmer, with\nsmall thanks for short courtesy.”\n\n“Good-night, and Our Lady's benison,” said the Palmer, with composure;\nand his guide moved forward.\n\nIn a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was\nlighted by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the\nwaiting-maid of Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her\nmistress desired to speak with the Palmer, took the torch from the hand\nof Anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the\nPalmer to follow. Apparently he did not think it proper to decline this\ninvitation as he had done the former; for, though his gesture\nindicated some surprise at the summons, he obeyed it without answer or\nremonstrance.\n\nA short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was\ncomposed of a solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of the Lady\nRowena, the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which\nwas paid to her by the lord of the mansion. The walls were covered with\nembroidered hangings, on which different-coloured silks, interwoven with\ngold and silver threads, had been employed with all the art of which the\nage was capable, to represent the sports of hunting and hawking. The bed\nwas adorned with the same rich tapestry, and surrounded with curtains\ndyed with purple. The seats had also their stained coverings, and one,\nwhich was higher than the rest, was accommodated with a footstool of\nivory, curiously carved.\n\nNo fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches,\nserved to illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beauty envy the\nmagnificence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill\nfinished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook in the\nnight blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect\nthem from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the\nair, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. Magnificence there was,\nwith some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was little, and,\nbeing unknown, it was unmissed.\n\nThe Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and\narranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of\nthrone already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage.\nThe Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.\n\n“Rise, Palmer,” said she graciously. “The defender of the absent has\na right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour\nmanhood.” She then said to her train, “Retire, excepting only Elgitha; I\nwould speak with this holy Pilgrim.”\n\nThe maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further\nextremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they\nremained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers\ncould not have interrupted the conversation of their mistress.\n\n“Pilgrim,” said the lady, after a moment's pause, during which she\nseemed uncertain how to address him, “you this night mentioned a name--I\nmean,” she said, with a degree of effort, “the name of Ivanhoe, in\nthe halls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded most\nacceptably; and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many\nwhose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, I, only, dare ask you\nwhere, and in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?--We heard,\nthat, having remained in Palestine, on account of his impaired health,\nafter the departure of the English army, he had experienced the\npersecution of the French faction, to whom the Templars are known to be\nattached.”\n\n“I know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,” answered the Palmer, with\na troubled voice. “I would I knew him better, since you, lady, are\ninterested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution\nof his enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning to England,\nwhere you, lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of\nhappiness.”\n\nThe Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the\nKnight of Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether\nhe would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. On the first\npoint, the Palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the\nvoyage might be safely made by the way of Venice and Genoa, and from\nthence through France to England. “Ivanhoe,” he said, “was so well\nacquainted with the language and manners of the French, that there was\nno fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.”\n\n“Would to God,” said the Lady Rowena, “he were here safely arrived, and\nable to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the chivalry\nof this land are expected to display their address and valour. Should\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoe is like to hear\nevil tidings when he reaches England.--How looked he, stranger, when\nyou last saw him? Had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and\ncomeliness?”\n\n“He was darker,” said the Palmer, “and thinner, than when he came from\nCyprus in the train of Coeur-de-Lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on\nhis brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to\nme.”\n\n“He will,” said the lady, “I fear, find little in his native land to\nclear those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, for your\ninformation concerning the companion of my childhood.--Maidens,” she\nsaid, “draw near--offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom I will\nno longer detain from repose.”\n\nOne of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of\nwine and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It was then offered\nto the Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.\n\n“Accept this alms, friend,” continued the lady, offering a piece of\ngold, “in acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines thou\nhast visited.”\n\nThe Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed\nEdwina out of the apartment.\n\nIn the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch\nfrom the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than\nceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number\nof small apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the\nlower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.\n\n“In which of these sleeps the Jew?” said the Pilgrim.\n\n“The unbelieving dog,” answered Anwold, “kennels in the cell next your\nholiness.--St Dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be\nagain fit for a Christian!”\n\n“And where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?” said the stranger.\n\n“Gurth,” replied the bondsman, “sleeps in the cell on your right, as the\nJew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision\nseparate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have occupied a\nmore honourable place had you accepted of Oswald's invitation.”\n\n“It is as well as it is,” said the Palmer; “the company, even of a Jew,\ncan hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.”\n\nSo saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch\nfrom the domestic's hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. Having\nshut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of\nwood, and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which\nwas of the most simple kind. It consisted of a rude wooden stool,\nand still ruder hutch or bed-frame, stuffed with clean straw, and\naccommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.\n\nThe Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking\noff any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or at least\nretained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their\nway through the little grated window, which served at once to admit both\nair and light to his uncomfortable cell. He then started up, and after\nrepeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, he left it, and entered\nthat of Isaac the Jew, lifting the latch as gently as he could.\n\nThe inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on\nwhich the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such parts of his dress\nas the Jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed\ncarefully around his person, as if to prevent the hazard of their\nbeing carried off during his slumbers. There was a trouble on his brow\namounting almost to agony. His hands and arms moved convulsively, as\nif struggling with the nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in\nHebrew, the following were distinctly heard in the Norman-English, or\nmixed language of the country: “For the sake of the God of Abraham,\nspare an unhappy old man! I am poor, I am penniless--should your irons\nwrench my limbs asunder, I could not gratify you!”\n\nThe Palmer awaited not the end of the Jew's vision, but stirred him with\nhis pilgrim's staff. The touch probably associated, as is usual, with\nsome of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started\nup, his grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and huddling some\npart of his garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with\nthe tenacious grasp of a falcon, he fixed upon the Palmer his keen black\neyes, expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension.\n\n“Fear nothing from me, Isaac,” said the Palmer, “I come as your friend.”\n\n“The God of Israel requite you,” said the Jew, greatly relieved; “I\ndreamed--But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a dream.” Then,\ncollecting himself, he added in his usual tone, “And what may it be your\npleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor Jew?”\n\n“It is to tell you,” said the Palmer, “that if you leave not this\nmansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may\nprove a dangerous one.”\n\n“Holy father!” said the Jew, “whom could it interest to endanger so poor\na wretch as I am?”\n\n“The purpose you can best guess,” said the Pilgrim; “but rely on this,\nthat when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his\nMussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and\ncharged them this morning to watch the journey of the Jew, to seize upon\nhim when at a convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct\nhim to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin, or to that of Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf.”\n\nIt is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon\nthe Jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole\nfaculties. His arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his\nbreast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his\nframe seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of\nthe Palmer, not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops, kneels,\nor prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man borne down on\nall sides by the pressure of some invisible force, which crushes him to\nthe earth without the power of resistance.\n\n“Holy God of Abraham!” was his first exclamation, folding and elevating\nhis wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the pavement;\n“Oh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed for nought,\nand the vision cometh not in vain! I feel their irons already tear my\nsinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows,\nand axes of iron over the men of Rabbah, and of the cities of the\nchildren of Ammon!”\n\n“Stand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,” said the Palmer, who viewed\nthe extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was\nlargely mingled; “you have cause for your terror, considering how your\nbrethren have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards, both\nby princes and nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out to you\nthe means of escape. Leave this mansion instantly, while its inmates\nsleep sound after the last night's revel. I will guide you by the secret\npaths of the forest, known as well to me as to any forester that ranges\nit, and I will not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some\nchief or baron going to the tournament, whose good-will you have\nprobably the means of securing.”\n\nAs the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech\nintimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise\nhimself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees,\nthrowing back his long grey hair and beard, and fixing his keen black\neyes upon the Palmer's face, with a look expressive at once of hope and\nfear, not unmingled with suspicion. But when he heard the concluding\npart of the sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full\nforce, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming, “'I' possess the\nmeans of securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour\nof a Christian, and how can the poor Jew find it, whom extortions have\nalready reduced to the misery of Lazarus?” Then, as if suspicion had\noverpowered his other feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, “For the love of\nGod, young man, betray me not--for the sake of the Great Father who\nmade us all, Jew as well as Gentile, Israelite and Ishmaelite--do me no\ntreason! I have not means to secure the good-will of a Christian beggar,\nwere he rating it at a single penny.” As he spoke these last words, he\nraised himself, and grasped the Palmer's mantle with a look of the\nmost earnest entreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if there were\ncontamination in the touch.\n\n“Wert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,” he said, “what\ninterest have I to injure thee?--In this dress I am vowed to poverty,\nnor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet think\nnot that I care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it;\nremain here if thou wilt--Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.”\n\n“Alas!” said the Jew, “he will not let me travel in his train--Saxon or\nNorman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and to travel\nby myself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf--Good youth, I will go with you!--Let us haste--let\nus gird up our loins--let us flee!--Here is thy staff, why wilt thou\ntarry?”\n\n“I tarry not,” said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his\ncompanion; “but I must secure the means of leaving this place--follow\nme.”\n\nHe led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,\nwas occupied by Gurth the swineherd.--“Arise, Gurth,” said the Pilgrim,\n“arise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and me.”\n\nGurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much\nconsequence in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus in Ithaca, was offended\nat the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. “The Jew\nleaving Rotherwood,” said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking\nsuperciliously at him without quitting his pallet, “and travelling in\ncompany with the Palmer to boot--”\n\n“I should as soon have dreamt,” said Wamba, who entered the apartment at\nthe instant, “of his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.”\n\n“Nevertheless,” said Gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log\nwhich served him for a pillow, “both Jew and Gentile must be content to\nabide the opening of the great gate--we suffer no visitors to depart by\nstealth at these unseasonable hours.”\n\n“Nevertheless,” said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, “you will not, I\nthink, refuse me that favour.”\n\nSo saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and\nwhispered something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as if\nelectrified. The Pilgrim, raising his finger in an attitude as if to\nexpress caution, added, “Gurth, beware--thou are wont to be prudent. I\nsay, undo the postern--thou shalt know more anon.”\n\nWith hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed,\nboth wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd's demeanour. “My\nmule, my mule!” said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.\n\n“Fetch him his mule,” said the Pilgrim; “and, hearest thou,--let me have\nanother, that I may bear him company till he is beyond these parts--I\nwill return it safely to some of Cedric's train at Ashby. And do\nthou”--he whispered the rest in Gurth's ear.\n\n“Willingly, most willingly shall it be done,” said Gurth, and instantly\ndeparted to execute the commission.\n\n“I wish I knew,” said Wamba, when his comrade's back was turned, “what\nyou Palmers learn in the Holy Land.”\n\n“To say our orisons, fool,” answered the Pilgrim, “to repent our sins,\nand to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.”\n\n“Something more potent than that,” answered the Jester; “for when would\nrepentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil\npersuade him to lend you a mule?--I trow you might as well have told his\nfavourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten\nas civil an answer.”\n\n“Go to,” said the Pilgrim, “thou art but a Saxon fool.”\n\n“Thou sayst well,” said the Jester; “had I been born a Norman, as I\nthink thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been next door to\na wise man.”\n\nAt this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the\nmules. The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two\nplanks breadth, the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness\nof the postern, and with a little wicket in the exterior palisade, which\ngave access to the forest. No sooner had they reached the mules, than\nthe Jew, with hasty and trembling hands, secured behind the saddle\na small bag of blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak,\ncontaining, as he muttered, “a change of raiment--only a change of\nraiment.” Then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste\nthan could have been anticipated from his years, he lost no time in so\ndisposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from\nobservation the burden which he had thus deposited “en croupe”.\n\nThe Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,\nhis hand to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.\nThe swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost\nunder the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his\nreverie by the voice of Wamba.\n\n“Knowest thou,” said the Jester, “my good friend Gurth, that thou art\nstrangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? I\nwould I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy\nunwonted zeal and courtesy--certes, I would make more out of it than a\nkiss of the hand.”\n\n“Thou art no fool thus far, Wamba,” answered Gurth, “though thou arguest\nfrom appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more--But it is time to\nlook after my charge.”\n\nSo saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.\n\nMeanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a\ndispatch which argued the extremity of the Jew's fears, since persons at\nhis age are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every path\nand outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the\nmost devious paths, and more than once excited anew the suspicion of\nthe Israelite, that he intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his\nenemies.\n\nHis doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the\nflying fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or\nthe waters, who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and\nrelentless persecution as the Jews of this period. Upon the slightest\nand most unreasonable pretences, as well as upon accusations the most\nabsurd and groundless, their persons and property were exposed to every\nturn of popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Briton, however\nadverse these races were to each other, contended which should look with\ngreatest detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a point of\nreligion to hate, to revile, to despise, to plunder, and to persecute.\nThe kings of the Norman race, and the independent nobles, who followed\ntheir example in all acts of tyranny, maintained against this devoted\npeople a persecution of a more regular, calculated, and self-interested\nkind. It is a well-known story of King John, that he confined a wealthy\nJew in one of the royal castles, and daily caused one of his teeth to\nbe torn out, until, when the jaw of the unhappy Israelite was half\ndisfurnished, he consented to pay a large sum, which it was the tyrant's\nobject to extort from him. The little ready money which was in the\ncountry was chiefly in possession of this persecuted people, and the\nnobility hesitated not to follow the example of their sovereign, in\nwringing it from them by every species of oppression, and even personal\ntorture. Yet the passive courage inspired by the love of gain, induced\nthe Jews to dare the various evils to which they were subjected, in\nconsideration of the immense profits which they were enabled to realize\nin a country naturally so wealthy as England. In spite of every kind\nof discouragement, and even of the special court of taxations already\nmentioned, called the Jews' Exchequer, erected for the very purpose of\ndespoiling and distressing them, the Jews increased, multiplied, and\naccumulated huge sums, which they transferred from one hand to another\nby means of bills of exchange--an invention for which commerce is said\nto be indebted to them, and which enabled them to transfer their wealth\nfrom land to land, that when threatened with oppression in one country,\ntheir treasure might be secured in another.\n\nThe obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed\nin opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they\nlived, seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which\nthey were visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in\ncommerce, while it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times\nused to extend their influence, and to secure to them a certain\ndegree of protection. On these terms they lived; and their character,\ninfluenced accordingly, was watchful, suspicious, and timid--yet\nobstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading the dangers to which they\nwere exposed.\n\nWhen the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious\npaths, the Palmer at length broke silence.\n\n“That large decayed oak,” he said, “marks the boundaries over which\nFront-de-Boeuf claims authority--we are long since far from those of\nMalvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.”\n\n“May the wheels of their chariots be taken off,” said the Jew, “like\nthose of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!--But leave me\nnot, good Pilgrim--Think but of that fierce and savage Templar, with\nhis Saracen slaves--they will regard neither territory, nor manor, nor\nlordship.”\n\n“Our road,” said the Palmer, “should here separate; for it beseems not\nmen of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must\nbe. Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful Pilgrim,\nagainst two armed heathens?”\n\n“O good youth,” answered the Jew, “thou canst defend me, and I know thou\nwouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it--not with money, for money, so\nhelp me my Father Abraham, I have none--but---”\n\n“Money and recompense,” said the Palmer, interrupting him, “I have\nalready said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it may be,\neven in some sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a Saracen,\ncan scarce be accounted unworthy of a Christian. Therefore, Jew, I will\nsee thee safe under some fitting escort. We are now not far from the\ntown of Sheffield, where thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with\nwhom to take refuge.”\n\n“The blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!” said the Jew; “in\nSheffield I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and find some means of\ntravelling forth with safety.”\n\n“Be it so,” said the Palmer; “at Sheffield then we part, and\nhalf-an-hour's riding will bring us in sight of that town.”\n\nThe half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim\nperhaps disdaining to address the Jew, except in case of absolute\nnecessity, and the Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a\nperson whose journey to the Holy Sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to\nhis character. They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the\nPilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield, which lay beneath them,\nrepeated the words, “Here, then, we part.”\n\n“Not till you have had the poor Jew's thanks,” said Isaac; “for I\npresume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zareth's, who might\naid me with some means of repaying your good offices.”\n\n“I have already said,” answered the Pilgrim, “that I desire no\nrecompense. If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for my\nsake, spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who\nstands in thy danger, I shall hold this morning's service to thee well\nbestowed.”\n\n“Stay, stay,” said the Jew, laying hold of his garment; “something\nwould I do more than this, something for thyself.--God knows the Jew\nis poor--yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe--but forgive me should I\nguess what thou most lackest at this moment.”\n\n“If thou wert to guess truly,” said the Palmer, “it is what thou canst\nnot supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.”\n\n“As I say?” echoed the Jew; “O! believe it, I say but the truth; I am\na plundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrung from me my\ngoods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed--Yet I can tell thee\nwhat thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. Thy wish even now is\nfor a horse and armour.”\n\nThe Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:--“What fiend\nprompted that guess?” said he, hastily.\n\n“No matter,” said the Jew, smiling, “so that it be a true one--and, as I\ncan guess thy want, so I can supply it.”\n\n“But consider,” said the Palmer, “my character, my dress, my vow.”\n\n“I know you Christians,” replied the Jew, “and that the noblest of you\nwill take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and walk afoot\nto visit the graves of dead men.”\n\n“Blaspheme not, Jew,” said the Pilgrim, sternly.\n\n“Forgive me,” said the Jew; “I spoke rashly. But there dropt words from\nyou last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint, showed\nthe metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmer's gown, is hidden a\nknight's chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as you stooped over my\nbed in the morning.”\n\nThe Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. “Were thy garments searched by as\ncurious an eye, Isaac,” said he, “what discoveries might not be made?”\n\n“No more of that,” said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth his\nwriting materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, he began to\nwrite upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his\nyellow cap, without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he\ndelivered the scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the Pilgrim,\nsaying, “In the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew, Kirjath\nJairam of Lombardy; give him this scroll--he hath on sale six Milan\nharnesses, the worst would suit a crowned head--ten goodly steeds, the\nworst might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of these\nhe will give thee thy choice, with every thing else that can furnish\nthee forth for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt return them\nsafely--unless thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the\nowner.”\n\n“But, Isaac,” said the Pilgrim, smiling, “dost thou know that in these\nsports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to\nhis victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace\nor repay.”\n\nThe Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting\nhis courage, he replied hastily. “No--no--no--It is impossible--I will\nnot think so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon thee. Thy lance\nwill be powerful as the rod of Moses.”\n\nSo saying, he was turning his mule's head away, when the Palmer, in his\nturn, took hold of his gaberdine. “Nay, but Isaac, thou knowest not all\nthe risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured--for I will spare\nneither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for\nnothing; something there must be paid for their use.”\n\nThe Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the colic;\nbut his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar\nto him. “I care not,” he said, “I care not--let me go. If there is\ndamage, it will cost you nothing--if there is usage money, Kirjath\nJairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee\nwell!--Yet hark thee, good youth,” said he, turning about, “thrust\nthyself not too forward into this vain hurly-burly--I speak not for\nendangering the steed, and coat of armour, but for the sake of thine own\nlife and limbs.”\n\n“Gramercy for thy caution,” said the Palmer, again smiling; “I will use\nthy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I will requite\nit.”\n\nThey parted, and took different roads for the town of Sheffield.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n     Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,\n     In gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;\n     One laced the helm, another held the lance,\n     A third the shining buckler did advance.\n     The courser paw'd the ground with restless feet,\n     And snorting foam'd and champ'd the golden bit.\n     The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,\n     Files in their hands, and hammers at their side;\n     And nails for loosen'd spears, and thongs for shields provide.\n     The yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands;\n     And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.\n     --Palamon and Arcite\n\nThe condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently\nmiserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of\nthe perfidious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his\ncaptivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the\ngenerality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every\nspecies of subaltern oppression.\n\nPrince John, in league with Philip of France, Coeur-de-Lion's mortal\nenemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria, to\nprolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted\nfor so many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his own\nfaction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession,\nin case of the King's death, with the legitimate heir, Arthur Duke of\nBrittany, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This\nusurpation, it is well known, he afterwards effected. His own character\nbeing light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his\nperson and faction, not only all who had reason to dread the resentment\nof Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the\nnumerous class of “lawless resolutes,” whom the crusades had turned back\non their country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished\nin substance, and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes\nof harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public distress and\napprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven\nto despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severe\nexercise of the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and,\nkeeping possession of the forests and the wastes, set at defiance the\njustice and magistracy of the country. The nobles themselves, each\nfortified within his own castle, and playing the petty sovereign over\nhis own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and\noppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To maintain these\nretainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence which their\npride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of money from\nthe Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates\nlike consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when circumstances\ngave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their\ncreditors some act of unprincipled violence.\n\nUnder the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs,\nthe people of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet\nmore dreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a\ncontagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land; and,\nrendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and\nthe wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept off many whose fate the\nsurvivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils which\nwere to come.\n\nYet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the\nvulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which was the\ngrand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved\ncitizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his\nfamily, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor infirmity\ncould keep youth or age from such exhibitions. The Passage of Arms,\nas it was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in the county of\nLeicester, as champions of the first renown were to take the field\nin the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected to grace the\nlists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense confluence of\npersons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of\ncombat.\n\nThe scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which\napproached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive\nmeadow, of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one\nside by the forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees,\nsome of which had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned\non purpose for the martial display which was intended, sloped gradually\ndown on all sides to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists\nwith strong palisades, forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length,\nand about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an oblong square,\nsave that the corners were considerably rounded off, in order to afford\nmore convenience for the spectators. The openings for the entry of the\ncombatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists,\naccessible by strong wooden gates, each wide enough to admit two\nhorsemen riding abreast. At each of these portals were stationed two\nheralds, attended by six trumpets, as many pursuivants, and a strong\nbody of men-at-arms for maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality\nof the knights who proposed to engage in this martial game.\n\nOn a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural\nelevation of the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions,\nadorned with pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the five\nknights challengers. The cords of the tents were of the same colour.\nBefore each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it\nwas occupied, and beside it stood his squire, quaintly disguised as a\nsalvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic dress, according to\nthe taste of his master, and the character he was pleased to assume\nduring the game. [16]\n\nThe central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian\nbe Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than\nhis connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of\nArms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the\nchallengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had\nso recently joined them. On one side of his tent were pitched those of\nReginald Front-de-Boeuf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was\nthe pavilion of Hugh de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity,\nwhose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the\nConqueror, and his son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St\nJohn of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called\nHeather, near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. From the\nentrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in breadth,\nled up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was strongly\nsecured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in front of the\npavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.\n\nThe northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of\nthirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed\nspace for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the\nchallengers, behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of\nevery kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other\nattendants, in readiness to give their services wherever they might be\nnecessary.\n\nThe exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries,\nspread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for the\nconvenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the\ntournament. A narrow space, betwixt these galleries and the lists, gave\naccommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than\nthe mere vulgar, and might be compared to the pit of a theatre. The\npromiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf\nprepared for the purpose, which, aided by the natural elevation of the\nground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view\ninto the lists. Besides the accommodation which these stations afforded,\nmany hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees which\nsurrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country church, at some\ndistance, was crowded with spectators.\n\nIt only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that\none gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and\nconsequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat\nwas to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly\ndecorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the\nroyal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen in rich liveries,\nwaited around this place of honour, which was designed for Prince John\nand his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was another, elevated\nto the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if\nless sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the Prince himself.\nA train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be\nselected, gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded\na throne decorated in the same colours. Among pennons and flags bearing\nwounded hearts, burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers,\nand all the commonplace emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned\ninscription informed the spectators, that this seat of honour was\ndesigned for “La Royne de las Beaulte et des Amours”. But who was to\nrepresent the Queen of Beauty and of Love on the present occasion no one\nwas prepared to guess.\n\nMeanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy\ntheir respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning\nthose which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by\nthe men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes,\nand pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to\nconvince the more refractory. Others, which involved the rival claims\nof more elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two\nmarshals of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who,\narmed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve\ngood order among the spectators.\n\nGradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their\nrobes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with\nthe gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater\nproportion than even the men themselves, thronged to witness a sport,\nwhich one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their\nsex much pleasure. The lower and interior space was soon filled by\nsubstantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as, from\nmodesty, poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume any higher place.\nIt was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for\nprecedence occurred.\n\n“Dog of an unbeliever,” said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore\nwitness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain\nintimated his pretensions to rank,--“whelp of a she-wolf! darest\nthou press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of\nMontdidier?”\n\nThis rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance\nIsaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine\nornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place\nin the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful\nRebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now hanging on her\nfather's arm, not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which\nseemed generally excited by her parent's presumption. But Isaac, though\nwe have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions, knew well that\nat present he had nothing to fear. It was not in places of general\nresort, or where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or\nmalevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such meetings the Jews\nwere under the protection of the general law; and if that proved a\nweak assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons\nassembled some barons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready\nto act as their protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more\nthan usually confident, being aware that Prince John was even then in\nthe very act of negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, to\nbe secured upon certain jewels and lands. Isaac's own share in this\ntransaction was considerable, and he well knew that the Prince's eager\ndesire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in\nthe dilemma in which he stood.\n\nEmboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and\njostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent,\nquality, or religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited\nthe indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set\nyeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his\nbelt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length\nin his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his\nconstant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew\ndarker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth\nhe had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but\nswelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he\nkept in a corner, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light.\nThis intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and\na stern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; and he would have probably\nwithdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the\nattention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of Prince\nJohn, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and\ngay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light in\ntheir dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Among\nthe latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a\ndignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not\nspared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding\nthe preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to\nbe attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and\neffectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. This,\nhowever, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who,\nperhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished\nhorsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex,\ndispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. The rest\nof Prince John's retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his\nmercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon\nthe court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.\n\nIt may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were\naccounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip\nof France in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine\nbetwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England. It was the\nwell-known consequence of this discord that Richard's repeated victories\nhad been rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege Jerusalem\ndisappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had\ndwindled into an uncertain truce with the Sultan Saladin. With the same\npolicy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the Holy\nLand, the Templars and Hospitallers in England and Normandy attached\nthemselves to the faction of Prince John, having little reason to desire\nthe return of Richard to England, or the succession of Arthur, his\nlegitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and\ncontemned the few Saxon families of consequence which subsisted in\nEngland, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them;\nbeing conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them,\nas well as by the greater part of the English commons, who feared\nfarther innovation upon their rights and liberties, from a sovereign of\nJohn's licentious and tyrannical disposition.\n\nAttended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly\ndressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and\nhaving his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of\nprecious stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread\nhis shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey,\ncaracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing\nloud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism\nthe beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.\n\nThose who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute\naudacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the\nfeelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of\ncomeliness which belongs to an open set of features, well formed by\nnature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far\nfrank and honest, that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the\nnatural workings of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for\nmanly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference\nof a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of\nwealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected\nwith personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they were\nthe greater number by a hundred to one, the splendour of Prince John's\n“rheno”, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with the\nmost costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs, together with\nthe grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufficient to merit\nclamorous applause.\n\nIn his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince\nwas called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the\nambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly.\nThe quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised the Jew, but was\nmuch more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who,\nterrified by the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.\n\nThe figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest\nbeauties of England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a\nconnoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical,\nand was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore\naccording to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban\nof yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The\nbrilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed\naquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her\nsable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted\ncurls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre\nof the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours\nembossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible--all these\nconstituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most\nbeautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the\ngolden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat\nto the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of\nthe heat, which somewhat enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A\ndiamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means\nalso made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened in her\nturban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of\nthe beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat\nabove her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.\n\n“By the bald scalp of Abraham,” said Prince John, “yonder Jewess must be\nthe very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest\nking that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?--By the Temple\nof that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable to\nrecover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!”\n\n“The Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,”--answered the Prior, in\na sort of snuffling tone; “but your Grace must remember she is still but\na Jewess.”\n\n“Ay!” added Prince John, without heeding him, “and there is my Mammon\nof unrighteousness too--the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants,\ncontesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have\nnot a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing\nthere. By the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely\nJewess, shall have a place in the gallery!--What is she, Isaac? Thy wife\nor thy daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as\nthou wouldst thy treasure-casket?”\n\n“My daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,” answered Isaac, with a\nlow congee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince's salutation, in which,\nhowever, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.\n\n“The wiser man thou,” said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his\ngay followers obsequiously joined. “But, daughter or wife, she should\nbe preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.--Who sits above\nthere?” he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. “Saxon churls,\nlolling at their lazy length!--out upon them!--let them sit close, and\nmake room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter. I'll make\nthe hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with\nthose whom the synagogue properly belongs to.”\n\nThose who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite\nspeech was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of\nhis ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on\naccount of his descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was held\nin the highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England.\nBut with the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities\nhad descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance, bulky\nand strong in person, and in the flower of his age--yet inanimate in\nexpression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his\nmotions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his\nancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called\nAthelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as\nCedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish\ntemper arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision;\nothers alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his\nfaculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage\nand meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a\ncharacter that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all the\nvaluable parts had flown off in the progress of a long course of brutal\ndebauchery.\n\nIt was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince\naddressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca.\nAthelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and\nfeelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to\nobey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the “vis inertiae” to\nthe will of John; and, without stirring or making any motion whatever of\nobedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the Prince with\nan astonishment which had in it something extremely ludicrous. But the\nimpatient John regarded it in no such light.\n\n“The Saxon porker,” he said, “is either asleep or minds me not--Prick\nhim with your lance, De Bracy,” speaking to a knight who rode near him,\nthe leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of\nmercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time\nto any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the\nattendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from\nall scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated\nthe gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of\nthe Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind\nsufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric,\nas prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of\nlightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed\nthe point of the lance from the handle. The blood rushed into the\ncountenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and\nwas about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was\ndiverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered\naround him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation\nof the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of\nCedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some\nsafe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the\nsame archer whom we have already noticed, and who seemed to persist\nin his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the\nPrince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.\n\n“I always add my hollo,” said the yeoman, “when I see a good shot, or a\ngallant blow.”\n\n“Sayst thou?” answered the Prince; “then thou canst hit the white\nthyself, I'll warrant.”\n\n“A woodsman's mark, and at woodsman's distance, I can hit,” answered the\nyeoman.\n\n“And Wat Tyrrel's mark, at a hundred yards,” said a voice from behind,\nbut by whom uttered could not be discerned.\n\nThis allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once\nincensed and alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with\ncommanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on\nthe braggart, pointing to the yeoman.\n\n“By St Grizzel,” he added, “we will try his own skill, who is so ready\nto give his voice to the feats of others!”\n\n“I shall not fly the trial,” said the yeoman, with the composure which\nmarked his whole deportment.\n\n“Meanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,” said the fiery Prince; “for, by\nthe light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have his seat\namongst ye!”\n\n“By no means, an it please your Grace!--it is not fit for such as we\nto sit with the rulers of the land,” said the Jew; whose ambition for\nprecedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated\nand impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means\nstimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy\nSaxons.\n\n“Up, infidel dog when I command you,” said Prince John, “or I will have\nthy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.”\n\nThus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led\nup to the gallery.\n\n“Let me see,” said the Prince, “who dare stop him,” fixing his eye on\nCedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jew down\nheadlong.\n\nThe catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing\nbetwixt his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Prince's\ndefiance, “Marry, that will I!” opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield\nof brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which,\ndoubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have\nproved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. Finding the\nabomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the Jester,\nat the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his head, the Jew\nrecoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,--an excellent\njest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which Prince John\nand his attendants heartily joined.\n\n“Deal me the prize, cousin Prince,” said Wamba; “I have vanquished my\nfoe in fair fight with sword and shield,” he added, brandishing the\nbrawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.\n\n“Who, and what art thou, noble champion?” said Prince John, still\nlaughing.\n\n“A fool by right of descent,” answered the Jester; “I am Wamba, the\nson of Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of an\nAlderman.”\n\n“Make room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,” said Prince John,\nnot unwilling perhaps to, seize an apology to desist from his original\npurpose; “to place the vanquished beside the victor were false\nheraldry.”\n\n“Knave upon fool were worse,” answered the Jester, “and Jew upon bacon\nworst of all.”\n\n“Gramercy! good fellow,” cried Prince John, “thou pleasest me--Here,\nIsaac, lend me a handful of byzants.”\n\nAs the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling\nto comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and\nwas perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a\nhandful, the Prince stooped from his jennet and settled Isaac's doubts\nby snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a\ncouple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career\nround the lists, leaving the Jew to the derision of those around him,\nand himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had\ndone some honest and honourable action.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n     At this the challenger with fierce defy\n     His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:\n     With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.\n     Their visors closed, their lances in the rest,\n     Or at the helmet pointed or the crest,\n     They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,\n     And spurring see decrease the middle space.\n     Palamon and Arcite\n\nIn the midst of Prince John's cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and\nappealing to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of\nthe day had been forgotten.\n\n“By my halidom,” said he, “we have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the\nfair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is to\nbe distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if\nI give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.”\n\n“Holy Virgin,” answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, “a\nJewess!--We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I am not\nyet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint, that\nshe is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.”\n\n“Saxon or Jew,” answered the Prince, “Saxon or Jew, dog or hog, what\nmatters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon\nchurls.”\n\nA murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.\n\n“This passes a jest, my lord,” said De Bracy; “no knight here will lay\nlance in rest if such an insult is attempted.”\n\n“It is the mere wantonness of insult,” said one of the oldest and most\nimportant of Prince John's followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, “and if your\nGrace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.”\n\n“I entertained you, sir,” said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily,\n“for my follower, but not for my counsellor.”\n\n“Those who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,” said\nWaldemar, but speaking in a low voice, “acquire the right of\ncounsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than\ntheir own.”\n\nFrom the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of\nacquiescence “I did but jest,” he said; “and you turn upon me like\nso many adders! Name whom you will, in the fiend's name, and please\nyourselves.”\n\n“Nay, nay,” said De Bracy, “let the fair sovereign's throne remain\nunoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him choose\nthe lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his\ntriumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who\ncan exalt them to such distinction.”\n\n“If Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,” said the Prior, “I will gage\nmy rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty.”\n\n“Bois-Guilbert,” answered De Bracy, “is a good lance; but there are\nothers around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter\nhim.”\n\n“Silence, sirs,” said Waldemar, “and let the Prince assume his seat.\nThe knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and\nhighly fit it is that the sports should commence.”\n\nPrince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the\ninconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,\nmust always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however,\nalthough his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be\nobstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded\nby his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the\ntournament, which were briefly as follows:\n\nFirst, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.\n\nSecondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select\na special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his shield.\nIf he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made\nwith what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with lances at\nwhose extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed, so that no danger\nwas encountered, save from the shock of the horses and riders. But if\nthe shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance, the combat was\nunderstood to be at “outrance”, that is, the knights were to fight with\nsharp weapons, as in actual battle.\n\nThirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of\nthem breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in the\nfirst day's tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite\nbeauty and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour,\nit was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the\nQueen of Love and Beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the\nensuing day.\n\nFourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a\ngeneral tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous\nto win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of\nequal numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given\nby Prince John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and Beauty\nwas then to crown the knight whom the Prince should adjudge to have\nborne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin\ngold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. On this second day\nthe knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow, feats of\narchery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be\npractised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this\nmanner did Prince John endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity,\nwhich he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of\nwanton aggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people.\n\nThe lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries\nwere crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful\nin the northern and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the\nvarious dresses of these dignified spectators, rendered the view as\ngay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space, filled with the\nsubstantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England, formed, in their more\nplain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant\nembroidery, relieving, and, at the same time, setting off its splendour.\n\nThe heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of\n“Largesse, largesse, gallant knights!” and gold and silver pieces were\nshowered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry\nto exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the\nsecretaries and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators\nwas acknowledged by the customary shouts of “Love of Ladies--Death of\nChampions--Honour to the Generous--Glory to the Brave!” To which the\nmore humble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band of\ntrumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds\nhad ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering\nprocession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the\nfield, who, armed cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues,\nat the opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the\nnorthern extremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely\ncrowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the\nchallengers, and, when viewed from the galleries, presented the\nappearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening\nhelmets, and tall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many\ncases, attached small pennons of about a span's breadth, which,\nfluttering in the air as the breeze caught them, joined with the\nrestless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene.\n\nAt length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot,\nadvanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and\nthe other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my\nSaxon authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at great length\ntheir devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse\ntrappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. To\nborrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but too little:\n\n     “The knights are dust,\n     And their good swords are rust,\n     Their souls are with the saints, we trust.” [17]\n\nTheir escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles.\nTheir castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins--the\nplace that once knew them, knows them no more--nay, many a race since\ntheirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they\noccupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal\nlords. What, then, would it avail the reader to know their names, or the\nevanescent symbols of their martial rank!\n\nNow, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their\nnames and feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining\ntheir fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the\nsame time, they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and\ndexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the\nsound of a wild Barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the\nchallengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern\norigin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the\ncymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the\nknights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of\nspectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform\nupon which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating\nthemselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance,\nthe shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The\nlower orders of spectators in general--nay, many of the higher class,\nand it is even said several of the ladies, were rather disappointed\nat the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For the same sort\nof persons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the deepest\ntragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to\nthe danger incurred by the champions engaged.\n\nHaving intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated\nto the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line;\nwhile the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their\nhorses, and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the\nplatform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had\ntouched their respective shields.\n\nAt the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against\neach other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or\ngood fortune of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert,\nMalvoisin, and Front-de-Boeuf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of\nGrantmesnil, instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest\nor the shield of his enemy, swerved so much from the direct line as\nto break the weapon athwart the person of his opponent--a circumstance\nwhich was accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually\nunhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident, whereas the\nformer evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of\nthe horse. The fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party,\nand parted fairly with the Knight of St John, both splintering their\nlances without advantage on either side.\n\nThe shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the\nheralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the\nvictors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to\ntheir pavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could,\nwithdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their\nvictors concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses, which,\naccording to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The fifth\nof their number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted\nby the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to the\naggravation, doubtless, of his companions' mortification.\n\nA second and a third party of knights took the field; and although\nthey had various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly\nremained with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or\nswerved from his charge--misfortunes which befell one or two of their\nantagonists in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed\nto them, seemed to be considerably damped by their continued success.\nThree knights only appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the\nshields of Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-Boeuf, contented themselves\nwith touching those of the three other knights, who had not altogether\nmanifested the same strength and dexterity. This politic selection\ndid not alter the fortune of the field, the challengers were still\nsuccessful: one of their antagonists was overthrown, and both the others\nfailed in the “attaint”, [18] that is, in striking the helmet and shield\nof their antagonist firmly and strongly, with the lance held in a direct\nline, so that the weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown.\n\nAfter this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did\nit appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest.\nThe spectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers,\nMalvoisin and Front-de-Boeuf were unpopular from their characters,\nand the others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and\nforeigners.\n\nBut none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as\nCedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman\nchallengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own\neducation had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry, although,\nwith the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on\nmany occasions, a brave and determined soldier. He looked anxiously\nto Athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if\ndesiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory\nwhich was passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates.\nBut, though both stout of heart, and strong of person, Athelstane had a\ndisposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which Cedric\nseemed to expect from him.\n\n“The day is against England, my lord,” said Cedric, in a marked tone;\n“are you not tempted to take the lance?”\n\n“I shall tilt to-morrow” answered Athelstane, “in the 'melee'; it is not\nworth while for me to arm myself to-day.”\n\nTwo things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman\nword “melee”, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced\nsome indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by\nAthelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not\ntrust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had\nno time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing, “It\nwas better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred,\nthan the best man of two.”\n\nAthelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric,\nwho better understood the Jester's meaning, darted at him a severe and\nmenacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and\nplace prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service,\nmore sensible marks of his master's resentment.\n\nThe pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by\nthe voices of the heralds exclaiming--“Love of ladies, splintering of\nlances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!”\n\nThe music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts\nexpressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday\nwhich seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles\nlamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs\nof their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames\nof such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times.\nPrince John began to talk to his attendants about making ready\nthe banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and\nfoiled a third.\n\nAt length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of\nthose long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of\nthe lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note\nof defiance from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see\nthe new champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the\nbarriers opened than he paced into the lists. As far as could be judged\nof a man sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly exceed\nthe middle size, and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made.\nHis suit of armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold, and the\ndevice on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled up by the roots, with\nthe Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was mounted on\na gallant black horse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully\nsaluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his lance. The dexterity\nwith which he managed his steed, and something of youthful grace which\nhe displayed in his manner, won him the favour of the multitude, which\nsome of the lower classes expressed by calling out, “Touch Ralph de\nVipont's shield--touch the Hospitallers shield; he has the least sure\nseat, he is your cheapest bargain.”\n\nThe champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the\nplatform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and,\nto the astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central\npavilion, struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his\npresumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus\ndefied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge,\nwas standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.\n\n“Have you confessed yourself, brother,” said the Templar, “and have you\nheard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?”\n\n“I am fitter to meet death than thou art” answered the Disinherited\nKnight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books\nof the tourney.\n\n“Then take your place in the lists,” said Bois-Guilbert, “and look your\nlast upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.”\n\n“Gramercy for thy courtesy,” replied the Disinherited Knight, “and to\nrequite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by\nmy honour you will need both.”\n\nHaving expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward\ndown the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same\nmanner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the\nnorthern extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his\nantagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of\nthe multitude.\n\nHowever incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he\nrecommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for\nhis honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means\nwhich might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed\nhis horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He\nchose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have\nbeen strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly,\nhe laid aside his shield, which had received some little damage, and\nreceived another from his squires. His first had only borne the general\ndevice of his rider, representing two knights riding upon one horse, an\nemblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars,\nqualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth\nthat finally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbert's new shield\nbore a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing\nthe motto, “Gare le Corbeau”.\n\nWhen the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two\nextremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the\nhighest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could\nterminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and\ngallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.\n\nThe trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished\nfrom their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre\nof the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into\nshivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both\nknights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards\nupon its haunches. The address of the riders recovered their steeds\nby use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on each other for an\ninstant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the bars of their\nvisors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of the\nlists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.\n\nA loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs,\nand general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators\nin this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which\nhad graced the day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their station,\nthan the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so\ndead, that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe.\n\nA few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their\nhorses might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to\nthe trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from\ntheir stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same\nspeed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal\nfortune as before.\n\nIn this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his\nantagonist's shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear\nwent to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle.\nOn the other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career,\ndirected the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbert's shield, but,\nchanging his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it\nto the helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,\nrendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit the Norman on\nthe visor, where his lance's point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even at\nthis disadvantage, the Templar sustained his high reputation; and had\nnot the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As\nit chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground under\na cloud of dust.\n\nTo extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the\nTemplar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at\nhis disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the\nspectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror.\nThe Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his\nsword. The marshals of the field, however, spurred their horses between\nthem, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the\npresent occasion, permit this species of encounter.\n\n“We shall meet again, I trust,” said the Templar, casting a resentful\nglance at his antagonist; “and where there are none to separate us.”\n\n“If we do not,” said the Disinherited Knight, “the fault shall not be\nmine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I am\nalike ready to encounter thee.”\n\nMore and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals,\ncrossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The\nDisinherited Knight returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert\nto his tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of\ndespair.\n\nWithout alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of\nwine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced\nthat he quaffed it, “To all true English hearts, and to the confusion of\nforeign tyrants.” He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance\nto the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he\nshould make no election, but was willing to encounter them in the order\nin which they pleased to advance against him.\n\nThe gigantic Front-de-Boeuf, armed in sable armour, was the first who\ntook the field. He bore on a white shield a black bull's head, half\ndefaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing\nthe arrogant motto, “Cave, Adsum”. Over this champion the Disinherited\nKnight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke\ntheir lances fairly, but Front-de-Boeuf, who lost a stirrup in the\nencounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.\n\nIn the stranger's third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was\nequally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that\nthe laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by\nbeing unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.\n\nIn his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed\nas much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De\nGrantmesnil's horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged\nin the course of the career so as to disturb the rider's aim, and the\nstranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded\nhim, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching\nhim, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists,\noffering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounter.\nThis De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself vanquished as much by the\ncourtesy as by the address of his opponent.\n\nRalph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger's triumphs, being\nhurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his\nnose and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.\n\nThe acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the\nPrince and marshals, announcing that day's honours to the Disinherited\nKnight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n     ----In the midst was seen\n     A lady of a more majestic mien,\n     By stature and by beauty mark'd their sovereign Queen.\n     * * * * *\n     And as in beauty she surpass'd the choir,\n     So nobler than the rest was her attire;\n     A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,\n     Plain without pomp, and rich without a show;\n     A branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,\n     She bore aloft her symbol of command.\n     The Flower and the Leaf\n\nWilliam de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field,\nwere the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying\nhim, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least,\nthat he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive\nthe prize of the day's tourney from the hands of Prince John. The\nDisinherited Knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their request,\nalleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for\nreasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists.\nThe marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for amidst the\nfrequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind\nthemselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than\nthose by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space, or\nuntil some particular adventure was achieved. The marshals, therefore,\npressed no farther into the mystery of the Disinherited Knight, but,\nannouncing to Prince John the conqueror's desire to remain unknown, they\nrequested permission to bring him before his Grace, in order that he\nmight receive the reward of his valour.\n\nJohn's curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;\nand, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which\nthe challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one\nknight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, “By the light of Our\nLady's brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his\ncourtesy as of his lands, since he desires to appear before us without\nuncovering his face.--Wot ye, my lords,” he said, turning round to his\ntrain, “who this gallant can be, that bears himself thus proudly?”\n\n“I cannot guess,” answered De Bracy, “nor did I think there had been\nwithin the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down\nthese five knights in one day's jousting. By my faith, I shall never\nforget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller\nwas hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.”\n\n“Boast not of that,” said a Knight of St John, who was present;\n“your Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance,\nBois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at\nevery turn.”\n\nDe Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was\nprevented by Prince John. “Silence, sirs!” he said; “what unprofitable\ndebate have we here?”\n\n“The victor,” said De Wyvil, “still waits the pleasure of your\nhighness.”\n\n“It is our pleasure,” answered John, “that he do so wait until we learn\nwhether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and\nquality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough\nto keep him warm.”\n\n“Your Grace,” said Waldemar Fitzurse, “will do less than due honour to\nthe victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that\nwhich we cannot know; at least I can form no guess--unless he be one of\nthe good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are\nnow straggling homeward from the Holy Land.”\n\n“It may be the Earl of Salisbury,” said De Bracy; “he is about the same\npitch.”\n\n“Sir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,” said Fitzurse;\n“Salisbury is bigger in the bones.” A whisper arose among the train,\nbut by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. “It might be the\nKing--it might be Richard Coeur-de-Lion himself!”\n\n“Over God's forbode!” said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the\nsame time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of\nlightning; “Waldemar!--De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember\nyour promises, and stand truly by me!”\n\n“Here is no danger impending,” said Waldemar Fitzurse; “are you so\nlittle acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father's son, as\nto think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit\nof armour?--De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by\nbringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has\nconjured all the blood from his cheeks.--Look at him more closely,” he\ncontinued, “your highness will see that he wants three inches of King\nRichard's height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very\nhorse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King\nRichard through a single course.”\n\nWhile he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited\nKnight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent\nfrom the lists to Prince John's throne. Still discomposed with the idea\nthat his brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted,\nhad suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions\npointed out by Fitzurse did not altogether remove the Prince's\napprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his\nvalour, he caused to be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the\nprize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before\nhim, an answer might be returned, in the deep and awful accents of\nRichard the Lion-hearted.\n\nBut the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment\nof the Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.\n\nThe horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the\nanimal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture;\nwhich, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the\neyes of those who were judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of the\nsaddle, the Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of the\nsteed without making use of the stirrup, and, brandishing aloft his\nlance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of\nthe horse with the skill of a perfect horseman.\n\nThe appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to\nthis display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the\nbest advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured,\nand the Knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all present.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince\nJohn, in a whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment,\ninstead of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced\nthe galleries a lady, who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty\nand of Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day.\nThe Prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the Knight\npassed him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned\ntowards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within\na foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting John's\ncommands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly\nreduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high\nexcitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.\n\n“Sir Disinherited Knight,” said Prince John, “since that is the only\ntitle by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as\nprivilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love,\nis to preside over next day's festival. If, as a stranger in our land,\nyou should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we\ncan only say that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar\nFitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in\nplace. Nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom\nyou please this crown, by the delivery of which to the lady of\nyour choice, the election of to-morrow's Queen will be formal and\ncomplete.--Raise your lance.”\n\nThe Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of\ngreen satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge\nof which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably,\nlike the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.\n\nIn the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar\nFitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,\nwhich was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low\nartifice and cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry\naround him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess\nRebecca; he was desirous of conciliating Alicia's father Waldemar,\nof whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself\ndissatisfied during the course of the day's proceedings. He had also a\nwish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for John was\nat least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition.\nBut besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against\nthe Disinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong\ndislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse, who was\nlikely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in\ncase, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.\n\nAnd so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery\nclose to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the\nfull pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he\nhad hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his\nright of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid\ncircle.\n\nIt was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who\nunderwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some\nblushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight\nforward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on,\nsome drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured to\nforbear smiling, and there were two or three who laughed outright. There\nwere also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as the\nWardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing, it\nmay be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they\nwere willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to\nthe rising beauties of the age.\n\nAt length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady\nRowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to\nthe utmost.\n\nIt must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could\nhave bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which\nhe paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at\nthe discomfiture of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of\nhis two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, had, with\nhis body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each\ncourse, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. The\nLady Rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,\nthough without openly betraying the same intense interest. Even the\nunmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,\ncalling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health\nof the Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under the gallery\noccupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the\nday.\n\n“Father Abraham!” said Isaac of York, when the first course was run\nbetwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, “how fiercely that\nGentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way\nfrom Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass's\ncolt--and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph\nPareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of\nprofits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the\nhighways!”\n\n“If he risks his own person and limbs, father,” said Rebecca, “in doing\nsuch a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and\narmour.”\n\n“Child!” replied Isaac, somewhat heated, “thou knowest not what thou\nspeakest--His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour\nbelong to--Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!--Nevertheless, it is\na good youth--See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to battle\nagainst the Philistine--Pray, child--pray for the safety of the good\nyouth,--and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.--God of my\nfathers!” he again exclaimed, “he hath conquered, and the uncircumcised\nPhilistine hath fallen before his lance,--even as Og the King of\nBashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our\nfathers!--Surely he shall take their gold and their silver, and their\nwar-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for a\nspoil.”\n\nThe same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was\nrun, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value\nof the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each\nnew success. There had been therefore no small interest taken in the\nsuccess of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part of\nthe lists before which he now paused.\n\nWhether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the\nchampion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while\nthe eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then,\ngradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited\nthe coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The\ntrumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the Lady Rowena\nthe Queen of Beauty and of Love for the ensuing day, menacing with\nsuitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority.\nThey then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric, in the height\nof his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which Athelstane,\nthough less promptly, added one equally large.\n\nThere was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were\nas much unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the\nNorman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they\nthemselves had introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were drowned\nby the popular shout of “Long live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and\nlawful Queen of Love and of Beauty!” To which many in the lower area\nadded, “Long live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal\nAlfred!”\n\nHowever unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to\nthose around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the\nnomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left\nhis throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again\nentered the lists. The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of\nthe Lady Alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the same\ntime, to those around him--“By my halidome, sirs! if the Knight's feats\nin arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath no\nless proved that his eyes are none of the clearest.”\n\nIt was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John's misfortune,\nnot perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to\nconciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the\nPrince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been\nslighted.\n\n“I know no right of chivalry,” he said, “more precious or inalienable\nthan that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own\njudgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own\ncharacter, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full\nproportion of that which is her due.”\n\nPrince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent\nto his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where\nRowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.\n\n“Assume,” he said, “fair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which\nnone vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if\nit please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our\nbanquet in the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to\nwhose service we devote to-morrow.”\n\nRowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.\n\n“The Lady Rowena,” he said, “possesses not the language in which to\nreply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I also,\nand the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and\npractise only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore decline with\nthanks your Highness's courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow,\nthe Lady Rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been\ncalled by the free election of the victor Knight, confirmed by the\nacclamations of the people.”\n\nSo saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena's head, in\ntoken of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.\n\n“What says he?” said Prince John, affecting not to understand the\nSaxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of\nCedric's speech was repeated to him in French. “It is well,” he said;\n“to-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of\ndignity.--You, at least, Sir Knight,” he added, turning to the victor,\nwho had remained near the gallery, “will this day share our banquet?”\n\nThe Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice,\nexcused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for\nto-morrow's encounter.\n\n“It is well,” said Prince John, haughtily; “although unused to such\nrefusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though\nungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of\nBeauty.”\n\nSo saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and\nhis turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking\nup and dispersion of the spectators.\n\nYet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially\nwhen combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded\nthree paces, ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern\nresentment upon the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of\nthe day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near--“On\nyour life, suffer not that fellow to escape.”\n\nThe yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried\nsteadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile,\n“I have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow--I\nmust see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw their bows--the\nforests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers.”\n\n“I,” said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply,--“I\nwill see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill\nshould prove some apology for his insolence!”\n\n“It is full time,” said De Bracy, “that the 'outrecuidance' [19] of\nthese peasants should be restrained by some striking example.”\n\nWaldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the\nreadiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.\nPrince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of\nthe multitude became general.\n\nIn various routes, according to the different quarters from which\nthey came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen\nretiring over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards\nthe town of Ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged\nin the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself.\nAmong these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the\ntournament, or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as\nthey rode slowly along, talking over the events of the day, were greeted\nwith loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were bestowed\nupon Prince John, although he was indebted for them rather to the\nsplendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his\ncharacter.\n\nA more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited\nacclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw\nhimself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of\nthose pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of\nwhich was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field. On his\nretiring to his tent, many who had lingered in the lists, to look upon\nand form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.\n\nThe signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded\ntogether in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were now\nexchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating\nin all directions, and these speedily died away in silence. No other\nsounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the\ngalleries of their cushions and tapestry, in order to put them in safety\nfor the night, and wrangled among themselves for the half-used bottles\nof wine and relics of the refreshment which had been served round to the\nspectators.\n\nBeyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and\nthese now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of\nthe armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order\nto repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.\n\nA strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to\ntwo hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n     Thus, like the sad presaging raven, that tolls\n     The sick man's passport in her hollow beak,\n     And in the shadow of the silent night\n     Doth shake contagion from her sable wings;\n     Vex'd and tormented, runs poor Barrabas,\n     With fatal curses towards these Christians.\n     --Jew of Malta\n\nThe Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires\nand pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring\nfresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal\non this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one\ndesired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet\nhad refused, even at the command of Prince John, to lift his visor or\nto name his name. But their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified.\nThe Disinherited Knight refused all other assistance save that of his\nown squire, or rather yeoman--a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a\ncloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and face half-buried\nin a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito\nas much as his master. All others being excluded from the tent, this\nattendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his\narmour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the\nday rendered very acceptable.\n\nThe Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced\nto him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with\nhim. The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe\nusually worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished with a\nhood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the\nwearer, almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the\ntwilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered\na disguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an\nindividual chanced to be particularly well known.\n\nThe Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of\nhis tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom\nhe easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led\nhis master's charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day\nfought.\n\n“According to the laws of chivalry,” said the foremost of these men, “I,\nBaldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\nmake offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the Disinherited\nKnight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian de Bois-Guilbert\nin this day's Passage of Arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain\nor to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law\nof arms.”\n\nThe other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to\nawait the decision of the Disinherited Knight.\n\n“To you four, sirs,” replied the Knight, addressing those who had last\nspoken, “and to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one common\nreply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should\ndo ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by\nbraver cavaliers.--I would I could here end my message to these\ngallant knights; but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the\nDisinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will,\nof their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since\nthat which I wear I can hardly term mine own.”\n\n“We stand commissioned, each of us,” answered the squire of Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf, “to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses\nand suits of armour.”\n\n“It is sufficient,” said the Disinherited Knight. “Half the sum\nmy present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,\ndistribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the\nother half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and\nattendants.”\n\nThe squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep\nsense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a\nscale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse\nto Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. “From your master,”\n said he, “I will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name,\nthat our strife is not ended--no, not till we have fought as well with\nswords as with lances--as well on foot as on horseback. To this\nmortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and I shall not forget the\nchallenge.--Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one of\nhis companions, with whom I can with pleasure exchange courtesies; but\nrather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal defiance.”\n\n“My master,” answered Baldwin, “knows how to requite scorn with scorn,\nand blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you\ndisdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have\nrated the arms of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his\nhorse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one\nnor wear the other.”\n\n“You have spoken well, good squire,” said the Disinherited Knight,\n“well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent\nmaster. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to\nthy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend,\nfor thine own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you\nfreely.”\n\nBaldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the\nDisinherited Knight entered the pavilion.\n\n“Thus far, Gurth,” said he, addressing his attendant, “the reputation of\nEnglish chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.”\n\n“And I,” said Gurth, “for a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the\npersonage of a Norman squire-at-arms.”\n\n“Yea, but,” answered the Disinherited Knight, “thou hast ever kept me in\nanxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.”\n\n“Tush!” said Gurth, “I fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,\nWamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were most\nknave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master\npassed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his\nporkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I\nam discovered---”\n\n“Enough,” said the Disinherited Knight, “thou knowest my promise.”\n\n“Nay, for that matter,” said Gurth, “I will never fail my friend for\nfear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife or\nscourge as well as any boar's hide in my herd.”\n\n“Trust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,” said the\nKnight. “Meanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold.”\n\n“I am richer,” said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, “than ever was\nswineherd or bondsman.”\n\n“Take this bag of gold to Ashby,” continued his master, “and find out\nIsaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms\nwith which his credit supplied me.”\n\n“Nay, by St Dunstan,” replied Gurth, “that I will not do.”\n\n“How, knave,” replied his master, “wilt thou not obey my commands?”\n\n“So they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,” replied Gurth;\n“but this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would be\ndishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it\nwere the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a\nbeliever to enrich an infidel.”\n\n“See him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,” said the\nDisinherited Knight.\n\n“I will do so,” said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving\nthe apartment; “and it will go hard,” he muttered, “but I content him\nwith one-half of his own asking.” So saying, he departed, and left the\nDisinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more\naccounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a\nnature peculiarly agitating and painful.\n\nWe must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a\ncountry house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with\nwhom Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the\nJews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of\nhospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to\nbe reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they\ntermed Gentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little\nhospitality at their hand.\n\nIn an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of\nan Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions,\nwhich, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served,\nlike the estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. She\nwas watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and\nfilial affection, while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien\nand disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together--sometimes\ncasting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under\ngreat mental tribulation. “O, Jacob!” he exclaimed--“O, all ye twelve\nHoly Fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who\nhath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses--Fifty zecchins\nwrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!”\n\n“But, father,” said Rebecca, “you seemed to give the gold to Prince John\nwillingly.”\n\n“Willingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!--Willingly, saidst thou?--Ay,\nas willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise\nto lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest--robed the\nseething billows in my choice silks--perfumed their briny foam with\nmyrrh and aloes--enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And\nwas not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made the\nsacrifice?”\n\n“But it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives,”\n answered Rebecca, “and the God of our fathers has since blessed your\nstore and your gettings.”\n\n“Ay,” answered Isaac, “but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did\nto-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?--O, daughter,\ndisinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our\nrace is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs\naround, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to\nsmile tamely, when we would revenge bravely.”\n\n“Think not thus of it, my father,” said Rebecca; “we also have\nadvantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in\nsome sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise\nand persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish\nforth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold\nwhich we lend them returns with increase to our coffers. We are like the\nherb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this day's\npageant had not proceeded without the consent of the despised Jew, who\nfurnished the means.”\n\n“Daughter,” said Isaac, “thou hast harped upon another string of sorrow.\nThe goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my\nadventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester--there is a dead loss\ntoo--ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the space\nbetween two Sabbaths--and yet it may end better than I now think, for\n'tis a good youth.”\n\n“Assuredly,” said Rebecca, “you shall not repent you of requiting the\ngood deed received of the stranger knight.”\n\n“I trust so, daughter,” said Isaac, “and I trust too in the rebuilding\nof Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls\nand battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very\nbest of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the\njudge and jailor.”\n\nSo saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and\nRebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to\nawaken new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing\nefforts--a prudential line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set\nup for comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.\n\nThe evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the\napartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with perfumed\noil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the\nsame time displayed by another Israelitish domestic on a small ebony\ntable, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their houses, the\nJews refused themselves no expensive indulgences. At the same time the\nservant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed Christians,\nwhile conversing among themselves) desired to speak with him. He that\nwould live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of every one\nclaiming business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the\nuntasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and\nsaying hastily to his daughter, “Rebecca, veil thyself,” commanded the\nstranger to be admitted.\n\nJust as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver\ngauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered,\nwrapt in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather\nsuspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his\nbonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.\n\n“Art thou Isaac the Jew of York?” said Gurth, in Saxon.\n\n“I am,” replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had\nrendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)--“and who art\nthou?”\n\n“That is not to the purpose,” answered Gurth.\n\n“As much as my name is to thee,” replied Isaac; “for without knowing\nthine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?”\n\n“Easily,” answered Gurth; “I, being to pay money, must know that I\ndeliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, I\nthink, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.”\n\n“O,” said the Jew, “you are come to pay moneys?--Holy Father Abraham!\nthat altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost thou bring\nit?”\n\n“From the Disinherited Knight,” said Gurth, “victor in this day's\ntournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by Kirjath\nJairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to thy\nstable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay for the\narmour.”\n\n“I said he was a good youth!” exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation. “A\ncup of wine will do thee no harm,” he added, filling and handing to the\nswineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. “And how\nmuch money,” continued Isaac, “has thou brought with thee?”\n\n“Holy Virgin!” said Gurth, setting down the cup, “what nectar these\nunbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as\nmuddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!--What money have I\nbrought with me?” continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil\nejaculation, “even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What,\nIsaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one.”\n\n“Nay, but,” said Isaac, “thy master has won goodly steeds and rich\narmours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand--but 'tis\na good youth--the Jew will take these in present payment, and render him\nback the surplus.”\n\n“My master has disposed of them already,” said Gurth.\n\n“Ah! that was wrong,” said the Jew, “that was the part of a fool. No\nChristians here could buy so many horses and armour--no Jew except\nmyself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins\nwith thee in that bag,” said Isaac, prying under Gurth's cloak, “it is a\nheavy one.”\n\n“I have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,” said Gurth, readily.\n\n“Well, then”--said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love\nof gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance, “if\nI should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and\nthe rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder's profit, have you money\nto pay me?”\n\n“Barely,” said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than\nhe expected, “and it will leave my master nigh penniless. Nevertheless,\nif such be your least offer, I must be content.”\n\n“Fill thyself another goblet of wine,” said the Jew. “Ah! eighty\nzecchins is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the\nmoneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this\nday's encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed\nrushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but\nhave had wrong.”\n\n“And I say,” replied Gurth, “he is sound, wind and limb; and you may\nsee him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy\nzecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian's word is as\ngood as a Jew's. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this bag”\n (and he shook it till the contents jingled) “back to my master.”\n\n“Nay, nay!” said Isaac; “lay down the talents--the shekels--the eighty\nzecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally.”\n\nGurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the\ntable, the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and\nsuit of armour. The Jew's hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the\nfirst seventy pieces of gold. The last ten he told over with much\ndeliberation, pausing, and saying something as he took each piece from\nthe table, and dropt it into his purse. It seemed as if his avarice were\nstruggling with his better nature, and compelling him to pouch zecchin\nafter zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore some part at\nleast to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His whole speech\nran nearly thus:\n\n“Seventy-one--seventy-two; thy master is a good youth--seventy-three,\nan excellent youth--seventy-four--that piece hath been clipt\nwithin the ring--seventy-five--and that looketh light of\nweight--seventy-six--when thy master wants money, let him come to Isaac\nof York--seventy-seven--that is, with reasonable security.” Here he made\na considerable pause, and Gurth had good hope that the last three pieces\nmight escape the fate of their comrades; but the enumeration\nproceeded.--“Seventy-eight--thou art a good fellow--seventy-nine--and\ndeservest something for thyself---”\n\nHere the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,\ndoubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his\nfinger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too\nflat, or had it felt a hair's breadth too light, generosity had carried\nthe day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the\nzecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not\nfind in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in\nabsence of mind, with the words, “Eighty completes the tale, and I trust\nthy master will reward thee handsomely.--Surely,” he added, looking\nearnestly at the bag, “thou hast more coins in that pouch?”\n\nGurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,\n“About the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully.”\n He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,--“Peril\nof thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!” He filled himself\nunbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without\nceremony.\n\n“Rebecca,” said the Jew, “that Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.\nNevertheless his master is a good youth--ay, and I am well pleased that\nhe hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed\nof his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of\nGoliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver's beam.”\n\nAs he turned to receive Rebecca's answer, he observed, that during his\nchattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the\ndark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance,\nwhen a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in\nher hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. Gurth had some reluctance\nto obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only\nearthly force was to be apprehended, he had all the characteristic\nterrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends, white women, and\nthe whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had brought with them\nfrom the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in the\nhouse of a Jew, a people who, besides the other unamiable qualities\nwhich popular report ascribed to them, were supposed to be profound\nnecromancers and cabalists. Nevertheless, after a moment's pause, he\nobeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition, and followed her into\nthe apartment which she indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise\nthat his fair guide was the beautiful Jewess whom he had seen at the\ntournament, and a short time in her father's apartment.\n\nShe asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he\ndetailed accurately.\n\n“My father did but jest with thee, good fellow,” said Rebecca; “he owes\nthy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were\ntheir value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?”\n\n“Eighty zecchins,” said Gurth, surprised at the question.\n\n“In this purse,” said Rebecca, “thou wilt find a hundred. Restore to\nthy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder.\nHaste--begone--stay not to render thanks! and beware how you pass\nthrough this crowded town, where thou mayst easily lose both thy burden\nand thy life.--Reuben,” she added, clapping her hands together, “light\nforth this stranger, and fail not to draw lock and bar behind him.”\n Reuben, a dark-brow'd and black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her summons,\nwith a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the house, and\nconducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket in\nthe entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains\nas would well have become that of a prison.\n\n“By St Dunstan,” said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, “this\nis no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave young\nmaster--twenty from this pearl of Zion--Oh, happy day!--Such another,\nGurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as free of thy\nguild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherd's horn and staff,\nand take the freeman's sword and buckler, and follow my young master to\nthe death, without hiding either my face or my name.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n     1st Outlaw: Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;\n     If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you.\n     Speed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villains\n     That all the travellers do fear so much.\n     Val: My friends,--\n     1st Out: That's not so, sir, we are your enemies.\n     2d Out: Peace! we'll hear him.\n     3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we;\n     For he's a proper man.\n     --Two Gentlemen of Verona\n\nThe nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he\nhimself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two\nstraggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found\nhimself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel\nand holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether\nacross the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the\ncarriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to\nthe tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted\nthe light of the harvest moon.\n\nFrom the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed\noccasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and\nsometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds, intimating\nthe disorderly state of the town, crowded with military nobles and\ntheir dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. “The Jewess was\nright,” he said to himself. “By heaven and St Dunstan, I would I were\nsafe at my journey's end with all this treasure! Here are such numbers,\nI will not say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights and errant\nsquires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant\njesters, that a man with a single merk would be in danger, much more a\npoor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. Would I were out of\nthe shade of these infernal bushes, that I might at least see any of St\nNicholas's clerks before they spring on my shoulders.”\n\nGurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common\nto which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his\nobject. Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the\nunderwood was thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears\nanticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast,\nthat resistance, if at first practicable, would have been now too\nlate.--“Surrender your charge,” said one of them; “we are the deliverers\nof the commonwealth, who ease every man of his burden.”\n\n“You should not ease me of mine so lightly,” muttered Gurth, whose\nsurly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate\nviolence,--“had I it but in my power to give three strokes in its\ndefence.”\n\n“We shall see that presently,” said the robber; and, speaking to his\ncompanions, he added, “bring along the knave. I see he would have his\nhead broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins\nat once.”\n\nGurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been\ndragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the\nlane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and\nthe open common. He was compelled to follow his rough conductors into\nthe very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an\nirregular open space, free in a great measure from trees, and on which,\ntherefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from\nboughs and leaves. Here his captors were joined by two other persons,\napparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their sides,\nand quarter-staves in their hands, and Gurth could now observe that\nall six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no\nquestion, even had their former proceedings left it in doubt.\n\n“What money hast thou, churl?” said one of the thieves.\n\n“Thirty zecchins of my own property,” answered Gurth, doggedly.\n\n“A forfeit--a forfeit,” shouted the robbers; “a Saxon hath thirty\nzecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and\nunredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.”\n\n“I hoarded it to purchase my freedom,” said Gurth.\n\n“Thou art an ass,” replied one of the thieves “three quarts of double\nale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he be\na Saxon like thyself.”\n\n“A sad truth,” replied Gurth; “but if these same thirty zecchins will\nbuy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to you.”\n\n“Hold,” said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others;\n“this bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak, contains\nmore coin than thou hast told us of.”\n\n“It is the good knight my master's,” answered Gurth, “of which,\nassuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with\nworking your will upon mine own property.”\n\n“Thou art an honest fellow,” replied the robber, “I warrant thee; and we\nworship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet\nescape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust\nfor a time.” So saying, he took from Gurth's breast the large leathern\npouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well as\nthe rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.--“Who is\nthy master?”\n\n“The Disinherited Knight,” said Gurth.\n\n“Whose good lance,” replied the robber, “won the prize in to-day's\ntourney? What is his name and lineage?”\n\n“It is his pleasure,” answered Gurth, “that they be concealed; and from\nme, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.”\n\n“What is thine own name and lineage?”\n\n“To tell that,” said Gurth, “might reveal my master's.”\n\n“Thou art a saucy groom,” said the robber, “but of that anon. How comes\nthy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means hath\nit accrued to him?”\n\n“By his good lance,” answered Gurth.--“These bags contain the ransom of\nfour good horses, and four good suits of armour.”\n\n“How much is there?” demanded the robber.\n\n“Two hundred zecchins.”\n\n“Only two hundred zecchins!” said the bandit; “your master hath dealt\nliberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name those\nwho paid the gold.”\n\nGurth did so.\n\n“The armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what\nransom were they held?--Thou seest thou canst not deceive me.”\n\n“My master,” replied Gurth, “will take nought from the Templar save\nhis life's-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold\ncourteous intercourse together.”\n\n“Indeed!”--repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the\nword. “And what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in thy\ncustody?”\n\n“I went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,” replied Gurth,\n“the price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this\ntournament.”\n\n“And how much didst thou pay to Isaac?--Methinks, to judge by weight,\nthere is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.”\n\n“I paid to Isaac,” said the Saxon, “eighty zecchins, and he restored me\na hundred in lieu thereof.”\n\n“How! what!” exclaimed all the robbers at once; “darest thou trifle with\nus, that thou tellest such improbable lies?”\n\n“What I tell you,” said Gurth, “is as true as the moon is in heaven. You\nwill find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch, and\nseparate from the rest of the gold.”\n\n“Bethink thee, man,” said the Captain, “thou speakest of a Jew--of an\nIsraelite,--as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts to\nreturn the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.”\n\n“There is no more mercy in them,” said another of the banditti, “than in\nan unbribed sheriffs officer.”\n\n“It is, however, as I say,” said Gurth.\n\n“Strike a light instantly,” said the Captain; “I will examine this said\npurse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew's bounty is little\nless miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the\nwilderness.”\n\nA light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine\nthe purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of\nGurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the\nissue of the search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden\nexertion of strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their\nhold, and might have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his\nmaster's property behind him. But such was no part of his intention.\nHe wrenched a quarter-staff from one of the fellows, struck down the\nCaptain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh\nrepossessed himself of the pouch and treasure. The thieves, however,\nwere too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty\nGurth.\n\n“Knave!” said the Captain, getting up, “thou hast broken my head;\nand with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy\ninsolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of\nthy master; the knight's matters must go before the squire's, according\nto the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime--if\nthou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy\nlife--Comrades!” he then said, addressing his gang, “this purse is\nembroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe the yeoman's tale\nis true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us toll-free. He\nis too like ourselves for us to make booty of him, since dogs should not\nworry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in abundance.”\n\n“Like us?” answered one of the gang; “I should like to hear how that is\nmade good.”\n\n“Why, thou fool,” answered the Captain, “is he not poor and disinherited\nas we are?--Doth he not win his substance at the sword's point as we\ndo?--Hath he not beaten Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, even as we would\nbeat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life and death of Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And were all\nthis otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an\nunbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?”\n\n“Nay, that were a shame,” muttered the other fellow; “and yet, when I\nserved in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples of\nconscience. And this insolent peasant,--he too, I warrant me, is to be\ndismissed scatheless?”\n\n“Not if THOU canst scathe him,” replied the Captain.--“Here, fellow,”\n continued he, addressing Gurth, “canst thou use the staff, that thou\nstarts to it so readily?”\n\n“I think,” said Gurth, “thou shouldst be best able to reply to that\nquestion.”\n\n“Nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,” replied the Captain;\n“do as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou\ndost not--why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think\nI must pay thy ransom myself.--Take thy staff, Miller,” he added, “and\nkeep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a\nstaff--there is light enough to lay on load by.”\n\nThe two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward\ninto the centre of the open space, in order to have the full benefit of\nthe moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their\ncomrade, “Miller! beware thy toll-dish.” The Miller, on the other hand,\nholding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round\nhis head after the fashion which the French call “faire le moulinet”,\nexclaimed boastfully, “Come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel\nthe strength of a miller's thumb!”\n\n“If thou be'st a miller,” answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon\nplay around his head with equal dexterity, “thou art doubly a thief, and\nI, as a true man, bid thee defiance.”\n\nSo saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they\ndisplayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting\nand returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid\ndexterity, while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person\nat a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons\nengaged on each side. Less obstinate, and even less dangerous combats,\nhave been described in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth and the\nMiller must remain unsung, for want of a sacred poet to do justice to\nits eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff play be out of date,\nwhat we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.\n\nLong they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at\nfinding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his\ncompanions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was\nnot a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in\nwhich, as in ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite;\nand it gave Gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the\nopportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of\nwhich he displayed great mastery.\n\nThe Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of\nhis weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance,\nwhile Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about\na yard asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great\ncelerity, so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain\nthe defensive, making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time, until,\nobserving his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face\nwith his left hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured to parry the thrust,\nhe slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the\nweapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head, who instantly\nmeasured his length upon the green sward.\n\n“Well and yeomanly done!” shouted the robbers; “fair play and Old\nEngland for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and\nthe Miller has met his match.”\n\n“Thou mayst go thy ways, my friend,” said the Captain, addressing Gurth,\nin special confirmation of the general voice, “and I will cause two of\nmy comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master's pavilion, and\nto guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender consciences\nthan ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night\nas this. Take heed, however,” he added sternly; “remember thou hast\nrefused to tell thy name--ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover\nwho or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou wilt come\nby worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.”\n\nGurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to\nhis recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves,\nand desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward\nalong a by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground\nadjacent to it. On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his\nconductors, and receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the\nwood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced\nGurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers, and that they\nkept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.\n\nWhen they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some\ntrouble in finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to\nthe top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him\nin the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions\npitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them fluttering\nin the moonbeams, and from which could be heard the hum of the song with\nwhich the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.\n\nHere the thieves stopt.\n\n“We go with you no farther,” said they; “it were not safe that we should\ndo so.--Remember the warning you have received--keep secret what has\nthis night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it--neglect\nwhat is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not protect you\nagainst our revenge.”\n\n“Good night to you, kind sirs,” said Gurth; “I shall remember your\norders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an\nhonester trade.”\n\nThus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence\nthey had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,\nnotwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the\nwhole adventures of the evening.\n\nThe Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the\ngenerosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not\nprofit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality\nseemed totally foreign. His course of reflections upon these singular\ncircumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking\nrepose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety\nof refreshing himself for the morrow's encounter, rendered alike\nindispensable.\n\nThe knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch\nwith which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending\nhis hardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the\npavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one\ncould enter without awakening him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n     The heralds left their pricking up and down,\n     Now ringen trumpets loud and clarion.\n     There is no more to say, but east and west,\n     In go the speares sadly in the rest,\n     In goth the sharp spur into the side,\n     There see men who can just and who can ride;\n     There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,\n     He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;\n     Up springen speares, twenty feet in height,\n     Out go the swordes to the silver bright;\n     The helms they to-hewn and to-shred;\n     Out burst the blood with stern streames red.\n     Chaucer.\n\nMorning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the\nhorizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the\ncommon, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a\nfavourable situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.\n\nThe marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together\nwith the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights\nwho intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This\nwas a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two\nbodies who should be opposed to each other.\n\nAccording to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered\nas leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had been\nrated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first\nchampion of the other band. Those who had concurred in the challenge\nadhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his\nfall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. There was no want\nof distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either\nside.\n\nIn fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought\nat once, was more dangerous than single encounters, they were,\nnevertheless, more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age.\nMany knights, who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to\ndefy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous\nof displaying their valour in the general combat, where they might\nmeet others with whom they were more upon an equality. On the present\noccasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of combating\nupon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could be\nadmitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in\npreferring their claim to be included.\n\nAbout the hour of ten o'clock, the whole plain was crowded with\nhorsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;\nand shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John\nand his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take\nshare in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.\n\nAbout the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena,\nunattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his\ntall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the\ncombatants; and, considerably to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to\nenlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had\nremonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had\nmade of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually\ngiven by those who are more obstinate in following their own course,\nthan strong in justifying it.\n\nHis best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though\nhis apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend\nhimself to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible\nto her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already\nfixed beyond doubt, by the assent of Cedric and her other friends. It\nhad therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though\nindolent Lord of Coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day\nselect Rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege\nto confer. In order to punish him for a preference which seemed to\ninterfere with his own suit, Athelstane, confident of his strength,\nand to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had\ndetermined not only to deprive the Disinherited Knight of his powerful\nsuccour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the\nweight of his battle-axe.\n\nDe Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to\na hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being\ndesirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the\nother hand, many other knights, both English and Norman, natives and\nstrangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that\nthe opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the\nDisinherited Knight had approved himself.\n\nAs soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had\narrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well\nupon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet\nher, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the Lady\nRowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time,\nand one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.\n\n“It is thus,” said Prince John, “that we set the dutiful example of\nloyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide to\nthe throne which she must this day occupy.--Ladies,” he said, “attend\nyour Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like\nhonours.”\n\nSo saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite\nhis own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded\nafter her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary\nsovereign.\n\nNo sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by\nthe shouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun\nshone fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either\nside, who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager\nconference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of\nbattle, and supporting the conflict.\n\nThe heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should\nbe rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers\nof the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict was to be\nmaintained with sharp swords and pointed lances.\n\nThe champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and\nwere confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace\nor battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A\nknight unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the\nopposite side in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that\ncase forbidden to assail him. When any knight could force his antagonist\nto the extremity of the lists, so as to touch the palisade with his\nperson or arms, such opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished,\nand his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror.\nA knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the\ncombat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to recover his\nfeet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag his master out\nof the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and\nhis arms and horse declared forfeited. The combat was to cease as\nsoon as Prince John should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon;\nanother precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion\nof blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate. Any knight\nbreaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise transgressing the\nrules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript of his arms, and,\nhaving his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the\nbars of the palisade, and exposed to public derision, in punishment of\nhis unknightly conduct. Having announced these precautions, the heralds\nconcluded with an exhortation to each good knight to do his duty, and to\nmerit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.\n\nThis proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their\nstations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in long\nprocession, arranged themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to\neach other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost\nrank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled\nthe ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his place.\n\nIt was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so\nmany gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready\nprepared for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles\nlike so many pillars of iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with\nthe same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing\nthe ground, gave signal of their impatience.\n\nAs yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points\nglancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated\nfluttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the\nmarshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness,\nlest either party had more or fewer than the appointed number. The tale\nwas found exactly complete. The marshals then withdrew from the lists,\nand William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder, pronounced the signal\nwords--“Laissez aller!” The trumpets sounded as he spoke--the spears of\nthe champions were at once lowered and placed in the rests--the spurs\nwere dashed into the flanks of the horses, and the two foremost ranks\nof either party rushed upon each other in full gallop, and met in the\nmiddle of the lists with a shock, the sound of which was heard at a\nmile's distance. The rear rank of each party advanced at a slower pace\nto sustain the defeated, and follow up the success of the victors of\ntheir party.\n\nThe consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust\nraised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was\na minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter.\nWhen the fight became visible, half the knights on each side were\ndismounted, some by the dexterity of their adversary's lance,--some by\nthe superior weight and strength of opponents, which had borne down\nboth horse and man,--some lay stretched on earth as if never more to\nrise,--some had already gained their feet, and were closing hand to hand\nwith those of their antagonists who were in the same predicament,--and\nseveral on both sides, who had received wounds by which they were\ndisabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring to\nextricate themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose lances\nhad been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now\nclosely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and\nexchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the\ncombat.\n\nThe tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank\non either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their\ncompanions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted--“Ha!\nBeau-seant! Beau-seant! [20]\n\n“--For the Temple--For the Temple!” The opposite party shouted in\nanswer--“Desdichado! Desdichado!”--which watch-word they took from the\nmotto upon their leader's shield.\n\nThe champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and\nwith alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the\nsouthern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one\nor the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and\nthe shouts of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the\ntrumpets, and drowned the groans of those who fell, and lay rolling\ndefenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the\ncombatants was now defaced with dust and blood, and gave way at every\nstroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the\ncrests, drifted upon the breeze like snow-flakes. All that was beautiful\nand graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what was now\nvisible was only calculated to awake terror or compassion.\n\nYet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators,\nwho are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of\ndistinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a thrilling\ninterest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a\nsight so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale,\nor a faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or a husband,\nwas struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies around encouraged\nthe combatants, not only by clapping their hands and waving their veils\nand kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, “Brave lance! Good sword!” when\nany successful thrust or blow took place under their observation.\n\nSuch being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game,\nthat of the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in\nloud acclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so\nriveted on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if they themselves\nhad dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed.\nAnd between every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming,\n“Fight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!--Fight on--death\nis better than defeat!--Fight on, brave knights!--for bright eyes behold\nyour deeds!”\n\nAmid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to\ndiscover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the\nfight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both\ndisplayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the\nDisinherited Knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who\ncould be termed their unquestioned match. They repeatedly endeavoured to\nsingle out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the\nfall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory. Such,\nhowever, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part\nof the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they were\nrepeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom\nwas anxious to win honour, by measuring his strength against the leader\nof the opposite party.\n\nBut when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had\nyielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity\nof the lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the\nstrife, the Templar and the Disinherited Knight at length encountered\nhand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry\nof honour, could inspire. Such was the address of each in parrying\nand striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and\ninvoluntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.\n\nBut at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst;\nthe gigantic arm of Front-de-Boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous\nstrength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing\nthose immediately exposed to them. Finding themselves freed from their\nimmediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights\nat the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage\nto their party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival.\nTurning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the Norman spurred\nagainst the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the\nother. It was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and\nunexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a\ngeneral cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one\nexposed to such disadvantage.\n\n“Beware! beware! Sir Disinherited!” was shouted so universally, that\nthe knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the\nTemplar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape\nthe charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Boeuf. These knights, therefore,\ntheir aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the\nobject of their attack and the Templar, almost running their horses\nagainst each other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their\nhorses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their\nunited purpose of bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.\n\nNothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and\nactivity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.\n\nThis stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was\nwounded, and those of Front-de-Boeuf and Athelstane were both tired with\nthe weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with\nthe preceding exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the\nDisinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he\nmounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword's point his\nthree antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon\nthe wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing\nnow against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with\nhis sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in\nreturn.\n\nBut although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it\nwas evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around\nPrince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to\nsave so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.\n\n“Not I, by the light of Heaven!” answered Prince John; “this\nsame springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered\nhospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to\nlet others have their turn.” As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident\nchanged the fortune of the day.\n\nThere was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in\nblack armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all\nappearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted.\nThis knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto\nevinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off with\nseeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing\nhis advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto\nacted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in the tournament,\na circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of “Le\nNoir Faineant”, or the Black Sluggard.\n\nAt once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered\nthe leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to\nhis horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a\nthunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, “Desdichado,\nto the rescue!” It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was\npressing upon the Templar, Front-de-Boeuf had got nigh to him with his\nuplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight dealt\na stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted\nwith violence scarcely abated on the “chamfron” of the steed, and\nFront-de-Boeuf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally stunned\nby the fury of the blow. “Le Noir Faineant” then turned his horse upon\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh; and his own sword having been broken in his\nencounter with Front-de-Boeuf, he wrenched from the hand of the bulky\nSaxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with\nthe use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest, that\nAthelstane also lay senseless on the field. Having achieved this double\nfeat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally\nunexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of\nhis character, returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists,\nleaving his leader to cope as he best could with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\nThis was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. The\nTemplars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the\nDisinherited Knight's charge. Brian de Bois-Guilbert rolled on the\nfield, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his\nfoot. His antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over\nthe head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when\nPrince John, more moved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had\nbeen by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing\nhimself vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to\nthe conflict.\n\nIt was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued\nto burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the\ngreater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time,\nleaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.\n\nThe squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to\nattend their masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists\nto pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with\nthe utmost care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the\nquarters prepared for them in the adjoining village.\n\nThus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most\ngallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four\nknights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had\ndied upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded,\nfour or five of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for\nlife; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to\nthe grave with them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as\nthe Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms of Ashby.\n\nIt being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done\nbest, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight\nwhom the popular voice had termed “Le Noir Faineant.” It was pointed out\nto the Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been\nin fact won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the\nday, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally\nunhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince\nJohn adhered to his own opinion, on the ground that the Disinherited\nKnight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance\nof the Knight of the Black Armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in\nawarding the prize.\n\nTo the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was\nnowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the conflict\nceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of\nthe forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent\nmanner which had procured him the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After\nhe had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of\nthe heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours\nwhich had been assigned to him. Prince John had now no further excuse\nfor resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom, therefore, he\nnamed the champion of the day.\n\nThrough a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour\nand the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists\nagain conducted the victor to the foot of Prince John's throne.\n\n“Disinherited Knight,” said Prince John, “since by that title only\nyou will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the\nhonours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and\nreceive from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of\nHonour which your valour has justly deserved.” The Knight bowed low and\ngracefully, but returned no answer.\n\nWhile the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in\nproclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor--while ladies\nwaved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks\njoined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the\nDisinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of\nhonour which was occupied by the Lady Rowena.\n\nOn the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.\nIndeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have\nbeen upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will;\nand it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time\nacross the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with a graceful\nand dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she held in her\nhand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed with\none voice, “It must not be thus--his head must be bare.” The knight\nmuttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow of his\nhelmet, but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque might\nnot be removed.\n\nWhether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no\nattention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting\nthe laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When\nthe helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a\nyoung man of twenty-five were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair\nhair. His countenance was as pale as death, and marked in one or two\nplaces with streaks of blood.\n\nRowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at\nonce summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling herself,\nas it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence\nof sudden emotion, she placed upon the drooping head of the victor\nthe splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day, and\npronounced, in a clear and distinct tone, these words: “I bestow on thee\nthis chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this day's\nvictor:” Here she paused a moment, and then firmly added, “And upon\nbrows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed!”\n\nThe knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign\nby whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet farther\nforward, lay prostrate at her feet.\n\nThere was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by\nthe sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to\nseparate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the\nmarshals of the field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoe's swoon, had\nhastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had\npenetrated his breastplate, and inflicted a wound in his side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n     “Heroes, approach!” Atrides thus aloud,\n     “Stand forth distinguish'd from the circling crowd,\n     Ye who by skill or manly force may claim,\n     Your rivals to surpass and merit fame.\n     This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,\n     For him who farthest sends the winged reed.”\n      --Iliad\n\nThe name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth\nto mouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and\ncuriosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the\nPrince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him,\nhowever, with an air of scorn, “My Lords,” said he, “and especially you,\nSir Prior, what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us, concerning\ninnate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence\nof my brother's minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder suit of\narmour enclosed.”\n\n“Front-de-Boeuf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe,” said De\nBracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had\nlaid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Prince's\nretinue.\n\n“Ay,” answered Waldemar Fitzurse, “this gallant is likely to reclaim\nthe castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your\nHighness's generosity has since given to Front-de-Boeuf.”\n\n“Front-de-Boeuf,” replied John, “is a man more willing to swallow three\nmanors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the rest,\nsirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the\ncrown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to\nperform the usual military service, in the room of those who have\nwandered to foreign Countries, and can neither render homage nor service\nwhen called upon.”\n\nThe audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce\nthe Prince's assumed right altogether indubitable. “A generous\nPrince!--a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of\nrewarding his faithful followers!”\n\nSuch were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of\nthem of similar grants at the expense of King Richard's followers and\nfavourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer\nalso assented to the general proposition, observing, however, “That the\nblessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She\nwas 'communis mater'--the mother of all Christians. But he saw not,”\n he declared, “how the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from\nthis, since he” (the Prior) “was assured that the crusaders, under\nRichard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all\nthe world knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of\nthe privileges of the Holy City.”\n\nWaldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe\nhad fallen to the ground, now returned. “The gallant,” said he,\n“is likely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave\nFront-de-Boeuf in the quiet possession of his gains--he is severely\nwounded.”\n\n“Whatever becomes of him,” said Prince John, “he is victor of the day;\nand were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,\nwhich is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to--our own\nphysician shall attend him.”\n\nA stern smile curled the Prince's lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse\nhastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and\nin the custody of his friends.\n\n“I was somewhat afflicted,” he said, “to see the grief of the Queen of\nLove and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into\nmourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman's lament for her lover,\nbut this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of\nmanner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her\ntearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form\nbefore her.”\n\n“Who is this Lady Rowena,” said Prince John, “of whom we have heard so\nmuch?”\n\n“A Saxon heiress of large possessions,” replied the Prior Aymer; “a rose\nof loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a\nbundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.”\n\n“We shall cheer her sorrows,” said Prince John, “and amend her blood, by\nwedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be at our\nroyal disposal in marriage.--How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst thou\nof gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the fashion\nof the followers of the Conqueror?”\n\n“If the lands are to my liking, my lord,” answered De Bracy, “it will be\nhard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold myself bound\nto your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in\nfavour of your servant and vassal.”\n\n“We will not forget it,” said Prince John; “and that we may instantly go\nto work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the\nLady Rowena and her company--that is, the rude churl her guardian, and\nthe Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament, upon\nthis evening's banquet.--De Bigot,” he added to his seneschal, “thou\nwilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the\npride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;\nalthough, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls\nbefore swine.”\n\nPrince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for\nretiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.\n\n“From whence?” said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was\ndelivered.\n\n“From foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not” replied his\nattendant. “A Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden night\nand day to put it into the hands of your highness.”\n\nThe Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the\nseal, placed so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was\nsurrounded, and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis.\nJohn then opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and\ngreatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were expressed\nin these words:\n\n“Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!”\n\nThe Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and\nthen up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of\nexecution has been passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects of\nhis surprise, he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put\nthe billet into their hands successively. “It means,” he added, in a\nfaltering voice, “that my brother Richard has obtained his freedom.”\n\n“This may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,” said De Bracy.\n\n“It is France's own hand and seal,” replied Prince John.\n\n“It is time, then,” said Fitzurse, “to draw our party to a head, either\nat York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it will be\nindeed too late. Your highness must break short this present mummery.”\n\n“The yeomen and commons,” said De Bracy, “must not be dismissed\ndiscontented, for lack of their share in the sports.”\n\n“The day,” said Waldemar, “is not yet very far spent--let the archers\nshoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. This will\nbe an abundant fulfilment of the Prince's promises, so far as this herd\nof Saxon serfs is concerned.”\n\n“I thank thee, Waldemar,” said the Prince; “thou remindest me, too, that\nI have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our\nperson. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. Were\nthis my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and\nto pleasure--let new cares come with to-morrow's new day.”\n\nThe sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already\nbegun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince John,\nsuddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself\nobliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow's festival:\nNevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without\na trial of skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the\nground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for\nthe morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being a\nbugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented\nwith a medallion of St Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.\n\nMore than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors,\nseveral of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of\nNeedwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom\nthey were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the\ncontest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat.\nFor in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well\nknown for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at\nNewmarket are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.\n\nThe diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to\neight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the\npersons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery.\nHaving satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the\nobject of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot,\nand with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the\npreceding day.\n\n“Fellow,” said Prince John, “I guessed by thy insolent babble that thou\nwert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not adventure\nthy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.”\n\n“Under favour, sir,” replied the yeoman, “I have another reason for\nrefraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace.”\n\n“And what is thy other reason?” said Prince John, who, for some cause\nwhich perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful\ncuriosity respecting this individual.\n\n“Because,” replied the woodsman, “I know not if these yeomen and I are\nused to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not how\nyour Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has\nunwittingly fallen under your displeasure.”\n\nPrince John coloured as he put the question, “What is thy name, yeoman?”\n\n“Locksley,” answered the yeoman.\n\n“Then, Locksley,” said Prince John, “thou shalt shoot in thy turn, when\nthese yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize,\nI will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt\nbe stript of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with\nbowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.”\n\n“And how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?” said the yeoman.--“Your\nGrace's power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed\neasily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my\nbow.”\n\n“If thou refusest my fair proffer,” said the Prince, “the Provost of the\nlists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel thee\nfrom the presence as a faint-hearted craven.”\n\n“This is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,” said the yeoman,\n“to compel me to peril myself against the best archers of Leicester And\nStaffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me.\nNevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.”\n\n“Look to him close, men-at-arms,” said Prince John, “his heart is\nsinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.--And do you,\ngood fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready\nfor your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.”\n\nA target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led\nto the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the\nbottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the\nmark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers. The\narchers, having previously determined by lot their order of precedence,\nwere to shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports were regulated\nby an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the Games; for the\nhigh rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded,\nhad they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry.\n\nOne by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts\nyeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession,\nten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,\nconsidering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. Of\nthe ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot\nby Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly\npronounced victorious.\n\n“Now, Locksley,” said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter\nsmile, “wilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up\nbow, baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?”\n\n“Sith it be no better,” said Locksley, “I am content to try my fortune;\non condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of\nHubert's, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose.”\n\n“That is but fair,” answered Prince John, “and it shall not be refused\nthee.--If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle\nwith silver-pennies for thee.”\n\n“A man can do but his best,” answered Hubert; “but my grandsire drew a\ngood long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory.”\n\nThe former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size\nplaced in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill,\nhad the right to shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation,\nlong measuring the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his\nbended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a\nstep forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm,\ntill the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he\ndrew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and\nlighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the\ncentre.\n\n“You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,” said his antagonist,\nbending his bow, “or that had been a better shot.”\n\nSo saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his\naim, Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as\ncarelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He\nwas speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring,\nyet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which\nmarked the centre than that of Hubert.\n\n“By the light of heaven!” said Prince John to Hubert, “an thou suffer\nthat runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!”\n\nHubert had but one set speech for all occasions. “An your highness\nwere to hang me,” he said, “a man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my\ngrandsire drew a good bow--”\n\n“The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!” interrupted\nJohn, “shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for\nthee!”\n\nThus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the\ncaution which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary\nallowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and\nshot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the\ntarget.\n\n“A Hubert! a Hubert!” shouted the populace, more interested in a known\nperson than in a stranger. “In the clout!--in the clout!--a Hubert for\never!”\n\n“Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,” said the Prince, with an\ninsulting smile.\n\n“I will notch his shaft for him, however,” replied Locksley.\n\nAnd letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it\nlighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers.\nThe people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful\ndexterity, that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their\nusual clamour. “This must be the devil, and no man of flesh and blood,”\n whispered the yeomen to each other; “such archery was never seen since a\nbow was first bent in Britain.”\n\n“And now,” said Locksley, “I will crave your Grace's permission to plant\nsuch a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome every brave\nyeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he\nloves best.”\n\nHe then turned to leave the lists. “Let your guards attend me,” he said,\n“if you please--I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.”\n\nPrince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in\ncase of his escape: but the cry of “Shame! shame!” which burst from the\nmultitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.\n\nLocksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in\nlength, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man's thumb. He\nbegan to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time,\nthat to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had\nhitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. “For his own part,”\n he said, “and in the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for\ntheir mark King Arthur's round-table, which held sixty knights around\nit. A child of seven years old,” he said, “might hit yonder target with\na headless shaft; but,” added he, walking deliberately to the other end\nof the lists, and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground, “he\nthat hits that rod at five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear\nboth bow and quiver before a king, an it were the stout King Richard\nhimself.”\n\n“My grandsire,” said Hubert, “drew a good bow at the battle of Hastings,\nand never shot at such a mark in his life--and neither will I. If this\nyeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers--or rather, I yield\nto the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man\ncan but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I\nmight as well shoot at the edge of our parson's whittle, or at a wheat\nstraw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can\nhardly see.”\n\n“Cowardly dog!” said Prince John.--“Sirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but,\nif thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever\ndid so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of\nsuperior skill.”\n\n“I will do my best, as Hubert says,” answered Locksley; “no man can do\nmore.”\n\nSo saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked\nwith attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought\nwas no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former\nshots. He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude\nawaited the event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their\nopinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it\nwas aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in\nadmiration of Locksley's skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his\nperson. “These twenty nobles,” he said, “which, with the bugle, thou\nhast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt\ntake livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be\nnear to our person. For never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so\ntrue an eye direct a shaft.”\n\n“Pardon me, noble Prince,” said Locksley; “but I have vowed, that if\never I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard.\nThese twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave\na bow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the\ntrial, he would have hit the wand as well I.”\n\nHubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the\nstranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed\nwith the crowd, and was seen no more.\n\nThe victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John's attention\nso easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more\nimportant meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called\nupon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists,\nand commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the\nJew. “Tell the dog,” he said, “to send me, before sun-down, two thousand\ncrowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a\ntoken. The rest of the money must be paid at York within six days. If\nhe neglects, I will have the unbelieving villain's head. Look that thou\npass him not on the way; for the circumcised slave was displaying his\nstolen finery amongst us.”\n\nSo saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the\nwhole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n     In rough magnificence array'd,\n     When ancient Chivalry display'd\n     The pomp of her heroic games,\n     And crested chiefs and tissued dames\n     Assembled, at the clarion's call,\n     In some proud castle's high arch'd hall.\n     --Warton\n\nPrince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was\nnot the same building of which the stately ruins still interest the\ntraveller, and which was erected at a later period by the Lord Hastings,\nHigh Chamberlain of England, one of the first victims of the tyranny\nof Richard the Third, and yet better known as one of Shakspeare's\ncharacters than by his historical fame. The castle and town of Ashby, at\nthis time, belonged to Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, who, during\nthe period of our history, was absent in the Holy Land. Prince John, in\nthe meanwhile, occupied his castle, and disposed of his domains without\nscruple; and seeking at present to dazzle men's eyes by his hospitality\nand magnificence, had given orders for great preparations, in order to\nrender the banquet as splendid as possible.\n\nThe purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions\nthe full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could\nbe collected which was esteemed fit for their master's table. Guests\nalso were invited in great numbers; and in the necessity in which he\nthen found himself of courting popularity, Prince John had extended his\ninvitation to a few distinguished Saxon and Danish families, as well as\nto the Norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. However\ndespised and degraded on ordinary occasions, the great numbers of\nthe Anglo-Saxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil\ncommotions which seemed approaching, and it was an obvious point of\npolicy to secure popularity with their leaders.\n\nIt was accordingly the Prince's intention, which he for some time\nmaintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which they\nhad been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple\nmade his ordinary habits and feelings bend to his interest, it was\nthe misfortune of this Prince, that his levity and petulance were\nperpetually breaking out, and undoing all that had been gained by his\nprevious dissimulation.\n\nOf this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent\nthither by his father, Henry the Second, with the purpose of buying\ngolden opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition\nto the English crown. Upon this occasion the Irish chieftains contended\nwhich should first offer to the young Prince their loyal homage and\nthe kiss of peace. But, instead of receiving their salutations with\ncourtesy, John and his petulant attendants could not resist the\ntemptation of pulling the long beards of the Irish chieftains; a\nconduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented by these\ninsulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences to the English\ndomination in Ireland. It is necessary to keep these inconsistencies\nof John's character in view, that the reader may understand his conduct\nduring the present evening.\n\nIn execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler\nmoments, Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane with distinguished\ncourtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the\nindisposition of Rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her\nnot attending upon his gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were both\ndressed in the ancient Saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in\nitself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was\nso remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that\nPrince John took great credit to himself with Waldemar Fitzurse for\nrefraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day\nrendered ridiculous. Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close\ntunic and long mantle of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a\nmore convenient dress, than the garb of the Normans, whose under garment\nwas a long doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggoner's frock,\ncovered by a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither fit to defend the\nwearer from cold or from rain, and the only purpose of which appeared\nto be to display as much fur, embroidery, and jewellery work, as the\ningenuity of the tailor could contrive to lay upon it. The Emperor\nCharlemagne, in whose reign they were first introduced, seems to have\nbeen very sensible of the inconveniences arising from the fashion of\nthis garment. “In Heaven's name,” said he, “to what purpose serve these\nabridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are no cover, on horseback they\nare no protection from the wind and rain, and when seated, they do not\nguard our legs from the damp or the frost.”\n\nNevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks\ncontinued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, and\nparticularly among the princes of the House of Anjou. They were\ntherefore in universal use among Prince John's courtiers; and the\nlong mantle, which formed the upper garment of the Saxons, was held in\nproportional derision.\n\nThe guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of\ngood cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on the Prince's progress,\nhaving exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary\nprovisions were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern\nprofessors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their\nnatural appearance. Besides these dishes of domestic origin, there were\nvarious delicacies brought from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich\npastry, as well as of the simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only\nused at the tables of the highest nobility. The banquet was crowned with\nthe richest wines, both foreign and domestic.\n\nBut, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking\nan intemperate race. While indulging themselves in the pleasures of\nthe table, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to\nattribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished Saxons, as vices\npeculiar to their inferior station. Prince John, indeed, and those who\ncourted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to\nexcess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is\nwell known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and\nnew ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners\nof his countrymen.\n\nWith sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the\nNorman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of Athelstane\nand Cedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were\nunaccustomed. And while their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic\nobservation, the untaught Saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the\narbitrary rules established for the regulation of society. Now, it is\nwell known, that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual\nbreach either of real good breeding or of good morals, than appear\nignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette. Thus Cedric,\nwho dried his hands with a towel, instead of suffering the moisture to\nexhale by waving them gracefully in the air, incurred more ridicule than\nhis companion Athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share\nthe whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign\ndelicacies, and termed at that time a “Karum-Pie”. When, however, it\nwas discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that the Thane of\nConingsburgh (or Franklin, as the Normans termed him) had no idea\nwhat he had been devouring, and that he had taken the contents of the\nKarum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact beccaficoes\nand nightingales, his ignorance brought him in for an ample share of the\nridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his gluttony.\n\nThe long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated\nfreely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,--of\nthe unknown victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose\nself-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had\nwon,--and of the gallant Ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours\nof the day. The topics were treated with military frankness, and the\njest and laugh went round the hall. The brow of Prince John alone was\noverclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed\nagitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints\nfrom his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing\naround him. On such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine\nas if to raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by some\nobservation made abruptly or at random.\n\n“We drink this beaker,” said he, “to the health of Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\nchampion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his wound renders him\nabsent from our board--Let all fill to the pledge, and especially Cedric\nof Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.”\n\n“No, my lord,” replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his\nuntasted cup, “I yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth, who\nat once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs\nof his fathers.”\n\n“'Tis impossible,” cried Prince John, with well-feigned astonishment,\n“that so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son!”\n\n“Yet, my lord,” answered Cedric, “so it is with this Wilfred. He left my\nhomely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brother's court,\nwhere he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so\nhighly. He left it contrary to my wish and command; and in the days\nof Alfred that would have been termed disobedience--ay, and a crime\nseverely punishable.”\n\n“Alas!” replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy,\n“since your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not\nbe enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial\ndisobedience.”\n\nThus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of\nHenry the Second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself had\nbeen most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.\n\n“I think,” said he, after a moment's pause, “that my brother proposed to\nconfer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.”\n\n“He did endow him with it,” answered Cedric; “nor is it my least quarrel\nwith my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the very\ndomains which his fathers possessed in free and independent right.”\n\n“We shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,” said Prince\nJohn, “to confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not\nbe diminished by holding land of the British crown.--Sir Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf,” he said, turning towards that Baron, “I trust you will\nso keep the goodly Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur\nhis father's farther displeasure by again entering upon that fief.”\n\n“By St Anthony!” answered the black-brow'd giant, “I will consent that\nyour highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric or Wilfred, or the\nbest that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the gift with\nwhich your highness has graced me.”\n\n“Whoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,” replied Cedric, offended\nat a mode of expression by which the Normans frequently expressed their\nhabitual contempt of the English, “will do thee an honour as great as it\nis undeserved.”\n\nFront-de-Boeuf would have replied, but Prince John's petulance and\nlevity got the start.\n\n“Assuredly,” said be, “my lords, the noble Cedric speaks truth; and\nhis race may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their\npedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.”\n\n“They go before us indeed in the field--as deer before dogs,” said\nMalvoisin.\n\n“And with good right may they go before us--forget not,” said the Prior\nAymer, “the superior decency and decorum of their manners.”\n\n“Their singular abstemiousness and temperance,” said De Bracy,\nforgetting the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.\n\n“Together with the courage and conduct,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\n“by which they distinguished themselves at Hastings and elsewhere.”\n\nWhile, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn,\nfollowed their Prince's example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at\nCedric, the face of the Saxon became inflamed with passion, and\nhe glanced his eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick\nsuccession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in\nturn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at\na loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge.\nAt length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion; and, addressing\nhimself to Prince John as the head and front of the offence which he had\nreceived, “Whatever,” he said, “have been the follies and vices of our\nrace, a Saxon would have been held 'nidering',” [21] (the most emphatic\nterm for abject worthlessness,) “who should in his own hall, and while\nhis own wine-cup passed, have treated, or suffered to be treated, an\nunoffending guest as your highness has this day beheld me used; and\nwhatever was the misfortune of our fathers on the field of Hastings,\nthose may at least be silent,” here he looked at Front-de-Boeuf and the\nTemplar, “who have within these few hours once and again lost saddle and\nstirrup before the lance of a Saxon.”\n\n“By my faith, a biting jest!” said Prince John. “How like you it,\nsirs?--Our Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd\nin wit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times--What say ye,\nmy lords?--By this good light, I hold it best to take our galleys, and\nreturn to Normandy in time.”\n\n“For fear of the Saxons?” said De Bracy, laughing; “we should need no\nweapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.”\n\n“A truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,” said Fitzurse;--“and it\nwere well,” he added, addressing the Prince, “that your highness should\nassure the worthy Cedric there is no insult intended him by jests, which\nmust sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.”\n\n“Insult?” answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; “I\ntrust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any, to be\noffered in my presence. Here! I fill my cup to Cedric himself, since he\nrefuses to pledge his son's health.”\n\nThe cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,\nwhich, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the Saxon\nthat had been designed. He was not naturally acute of perception,\nbut those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this\nflattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. He\nwas silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, “To Sir\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh.”\n\nThe knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by\ndraining a huge goblet in answer to it.\n\n“And now, sirs,” said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the wine\nwhich he had drank, “having done justice to our Saxon guests, we\nwill pray of them some requital to our courtesy.--Worthy Thane,” he\ncontinued, addressing Cedric, “may we pray you to name to us some Norman\nwhose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet\nof wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?”\n\nFitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of\nthe Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an\nend to unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The\nSaxon replied not to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and\nfilling his cup to the brim, he addressed Prince John in these words:\n“Your highness has required that I should name a Norman deserving to\nbe remembered at our banquet. This, perchance, is a hard task, since\nit calls on the slave to sing the praises of the master--upon the\nvanquished, while pressed by all the evils of conquest, to sing the\npraises of the conqueror. Yet I will name a Norman--the first in arms\nand in place--the best and the noblest of his race. And the lips that\nshall refuse to pledge me to his well-earned fame, I term false and\ndishonoured, and will so maintain them with my life.--I quaff this\ngoblet to the health of Richard the Lion-hearted!”\n\nPrince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed\nthe Saxon's speech, started when that of his injured brother was so\nunexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his\nlips, then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company\nat this unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe\nto oppose as to comply with. Some of them, ancient and experienced\ncourtiers, closely imitated the example of the Prince himself, raising\nthe goblet to their lips, and again replacing it before them. There\nwere many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed, “Long live King\nRichard! and may he be speedily restored to us!” And some few, among\nwhom were Front-de-Boeuf and the Templar, in sullen disdain suffered\ntheir goblets to stand untasted before them. But no man ventured\ndirectly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning\nmonarch.\n\nHaving enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his\ncompanion, “Up, noble Athelstane! we have remained here long enough,\nsince we have requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince John's banquet.\nThose who wish to know further of our rude Saxon manners must henceforth\nseek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal\nbanquets, and enough of Norman courtesy.”\n\nSo saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by\nAthelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxon\nlineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and his\ncourtiers.\n\n“By the bones of St Thomas,” said Prince John, as they retreated, “the\nSaxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated with\ntriumph!”\n\n“'Conclamatum est, poculatum est',” said Prior Aymer; “we have drunk and\nwe have shouted,--it were time we left our wine flagons.”\n\n“The monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such\na hurry to depart,” said De Bracy.\n\n“Not so, Sir Knight,” replied the Abbot; “but I must move several miles\nforward this evening upon my homeward journey.”\n\n“They are breaking up,” said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse; “their\nfears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the first to shrink\nfrom me.”\n\n“Fear not, my lord,” said Waldemar; “I will show him such reasons as\nshall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at York.--Sir\nPrior,” he said, “I must speak with you in private, before you mount\nyour palfrey.”\n\nThe other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those\nimmediately attached to Prince John's faction, and his retinue.\n\n“This, then, is the result of your advice,” said the Prince, turning\nan angry countenance upon Fitzurse; “that I should be bearded at my\nown board by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my\nbrother's name, men should fall off from me as if I had the leprosy?”\n\n“Have patience, sir,” replied his counsellor; “I might retort your\naccusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my\ndesign, and misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for\nrecrimination. De Bracy and I will instantly go among these shuffling\ncowards, and convince them they have gone too far to recede.”\n\n“It will be in vain,” said Prince John, pacing the apartment with\ndisordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to which the\nwine he had drank partly contributed--“It will be in vain--they have\nseen the handwriting on the wall--they have marked the paw of the\nlion in the sand--they have heard his approaching roar shake the\nwood--nothing will reanimate their courage.”\n\n“Would to God,” said Fitzurse to De Bracy, “that aught could reanimate\nhis own! His brother's very name is an ague to him. Unhappy are the\ncounsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in\ngood and in evil!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n     And yet he thinks,--ha, ha, ha, ha,--he thinks\n     I am the tool and servant of his will.\n     Well, let it be; through all the maze of trouble\n     His plots and base oppression must create,\n     I'll shape myself a way to higher things,\n     And who will say 'tis wrong?\n     --Basil, a Tragedy\n\nNo spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his\nweb, than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered\nmembers of Prince John's cabal. Few of these were attached to him from\ninclination, and none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary,\nthat Fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind\nthem of those which they at present enjoyed. To the young and wild\nnobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled\nrevelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of\nincreased wealth and extended domains. The leaders of the mercenaries\nreceived a donation in gold; an argument the most persuasive to their\nminds, and without which all others would have proved in vain. Promises\nwere still more liberally distributed than money by this active agent;\nand, in fine, nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering,\nor animate the disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of\nas an event altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when\nhe observed, from the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he\nreceived, that this was the apprehension by which the minds of his\naccomplices were most haunted, he boldly treated that event, should\nit really take place, as one which ought not to alter their political\ncalculations.\n\n“If Richard returns,” said Fitzurse, “he returns to enrich his needy and\nimpoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow him\nto the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who,\nduring his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or\nencroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of\nthe crown. He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the\nHospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during\nthe wars in the Holy Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel\nevery adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?”\n continued the artful confident of that Prince, “we acknowledge him a\nstrong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur,\nwhen a champion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back,\nit must be alone,--unfollowed--unfriended. The bones of his gallant army\nhave whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have\nreturned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared\nand broken men.--And what talk ye of Richard's right of birth?” he\nproceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. “Is\nRichard's title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of\nDuke Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror's eldest son? And yet William\nthe Red, and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively\npreferred to him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit\nwhich can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader,\ngenerous to his friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a\ncrusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind\nand miserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed\nhimself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule\nover them. It is our right,” he said, “to choose from the blood royal\nthe prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme power--that is,”\n said he, correcting himself, “him whose election will best promote the\ninterests of the nobility. In personal qualifications,” he added, “it\nwas possible that Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard;\nbut when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of\nvengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities,\nprivileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted which was the\nking whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support.”\n\nThese, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar\ncircumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with\nthe nobles of Prince John's faction. Most of them consented to attend\nthe proposed meeting at York, for the purpose of making general\narrangements for placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.\n\nIt was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various\nexertions, however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to\nthe Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting\ngarments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and\ncolour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over\nhis shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows stuck in\nhis belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment, he would\nhave passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the guard; but\nfinding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and\nrecognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English yeoman.\n\n“What mummery is this, De Bracy?” said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; “is\nthis a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of\nour master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou\nnot been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name\nof King Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the\nSaracens?”\n\n“I have been attending to mine own business,” answered De Bracy calmly,\n“as you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.”\n\n“I minding mine own business!” echoed Waldemar; “I have been engaged in\nthat of Prince John, our joint patron.”\n\n“As if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,” said De Bracy,\n“than the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse,\nwe know each other--ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they\nbecome our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that\nhe is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy\nmonarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too\nfickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch\nby whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you\naid him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions.”\n\n“A hopeful auxiliary,” said Fitzurse impatiently; “playing the fool in\nthe very moment of utter necessity.--What on earth dost thou purpose by\nthis absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?”\n\n“To get me a wife,” answered De Bracy coolly, “after the manner of the\ntribe of Benjamin.”\n\n“The tribe of Benjamin?” said Fitzurse; “I comprehend thee not.”\n\n“Wert thou not in presence yester-even,” said De Bracy, “when we heard\nthe Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by\nthe Minstrel?--He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud arose\nbetween the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish nation;\nand how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and\nhow they swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not permit those\nwho remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for\ntheir vow, and sent to consult his holiness the Pope how they might be\nabsolved from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy Father, the youth\nof the tribe of Benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the\nladies who were there present, and thus won them wives without the\nconsent either of their brides or their brides' families.”\n\n“I have heard the story,” said Fitzurse, “though either the Prior or\nthou has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances.”\n\n“I tell thee,” said De Bracy, “that I mean to purvey me a wife after the\nfashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say, that in\nthis same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who\nhave this night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely\nRowena.”\n\n“Art thou mad, De Bracy?” said Fitzurse. “Bethink thee that, though the\nmen be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more\nrespect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of\nfew of Saxon descent.”\n\n“And should belong to none,” said De Bracy; “the work of the Conquest\nshould be completed.”\n\n“This is no time for it at least,” said Fitzurse “the approaching crisis\nrenders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and Prince John\ncannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.”\n\n“Let him grant it, if he dare,” said De Bracy; “he will soon see the\ndifference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine,\nand that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate\ndiscovery of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever\nblew horn? The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the\nYorkshire forests. I have sure spies on the Saxon's motions--To-night\nthey sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they\ncall that churl of a Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next day's march\nbrings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them\nat once. Presently after I will appear in mine own shape, play the\ncourteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the\nhands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to Front-de-Boeuf's Castle, or\nto Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her\nkindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy.”\n\n“A marvellously sage plan,” said Fitzurse, “and, as I think, not\nentirely of thine own device.--Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided\nthee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I\nthink, thine own band lies as far off as York.”\n\n“Marry, if thou must needs know,” said De Bracy, “it was the Templar\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the\nadventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in\nthe onslaught, and he and his followers will personate the outlaws, from\nwhom my valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady.”\n\n“By my halidome,” said Fitzurse, “the plan was worthy of your united\nwisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in the\nproject of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou\nmayst, I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but how\nthou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems\nconsiderably more doubtful--He is a falcon well accustomed to pounce on\na partridge, and to hold his prey fast.”\n\n“He is a Templar,” said De Bracy, “and cannot therefore rival me in\nmy plan of wedding this heiress;--and to attempt aught dishonourable\nagainst the intended bride of De Bracy--By Heaven! were he a whole\nChapter of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an\ninjury!”\n\n“Then since nought that I can say,” said Fitzurse, “will put this\nfolly from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy\ndisposition,) at least waste as little time as possible--let not thy\nfolly be lasting as well as untimely.”\n\n“I tell thee,” answered De Bracy, “that it will be the work of a few\nhours, and I shall be at York--at the head of my daring and valorous\nfellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to\nform one.--But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping\nand neighing in the outer court.--Farewell.--I go, like a true knight,\nto win the smiles of beauty.”\n\n“Like a true knight?” repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; “like a\nfool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most serious and\nneedful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives\npast him.--But it is with such tools that I must work;--and for whose\nadvantage?--For that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as\nlikely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious\nson and an unnatural brother.--But he--he, too, is but one of the tools\nwith which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate\nhis interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.”\n\nThe meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice\nof the Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, “Noble Waldemar\nFitzurse!” and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such\nhigh preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the\norders of the future sovereign.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n     Far in a wild, unknown to public view,\n     From youth to age a reverend hermit grew;\n     The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,\n     His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well\n     Remote from man, with God he pass'd his days,\n     Prayer all his business--all his pleasure praise.\n     --Parnell\n\nThe reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was\ndecided by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, on account of the\npassive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former\npart of the day, the spectators had entitled, “Le Noir Faineant”. This\nknight had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved; and\nwhen he was called upon to receive the reward of his valour, he was\nnowhere to be found. In the meantime, while summoned by heralds and\nby trumpets, the knight was holding his course northward, avoiding all\nfrequented paths, and taking the shortest road through the woodlands.\nHe paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary\nroute, where, however, he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of the\nevent of the tourney.\n\nOn the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention\nof making a long journey; the condition of his horse, which he had\ncarefully spared during the preceding morning, being such as enabled him\nto travel far without the necessity of much repose. Yet his purpose was\nbaffled by the devious paths through which he rode, so that when evening\nclosed upon him, he only found himself on the frontiers of the\nWest Riding of Yorkshire. By this time both horse and man required\nrefreshment, and it became necessary, moreover, to look out for\nsome place in which they might spend the night, which was now fast\napproaching.\n\nThe place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for\nobtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be reduced\nto the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned\ntheir horses to graze, and laid themselves down to meditate on their\nlady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. But the Black Knight\neither had no mistress to meditate upon, or, being as indifferent\nin love as he seemed to be in war, was not sufficiently occupied by\npassionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to be able to\nparry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as\na substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. He felt\ndissatisfied, therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply\ninvolved in woods, through which indeed there were many open glades,\nand some paths, but such as seemed only formed by the numerous herds of\ncattle which grazed in the forest, or by the animals of chase, and the\nhunters who made prey of them.\n\nThe sun, by which the knight had chiefly directed his course, had now\nsunk behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effort which he\nmight make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his\nroad as to advance him on his route. After having in vain endeavoured\nto select the most beaten path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage of\nsome herdsman, or the silvan lodge of a forester, and having repeatedly\nfound himself totally unable to determine on a choice, the knight\nresolved to trust to the sagacity of his horse; experience having,\non former occasions, made him acquainted with the wonderful talent\npossessed by these animals for extricating themselves and their riders\non such emergencies.\n\nThe good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a day's journey under\na rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackened reins,\nthat he was abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new\nstrength and spirit; and whereas, formerly he had scarce replied to the\nspur, otherwise than by a groan, he now, as if proud of the confidence\nreposed in him, pricked up his ears, and assumed, of his own accord, a\nmore lively motion. The path which the animal adopted rather turned off\nfrom the course pursued by the knight during the day; but as the horse\nseemed confident in his choice, the rider abandoned himself to his\ndiscretion.\n\nHe was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared\na little wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the\nknight to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or\nhermitage.\n\nAccordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side\nof which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered\nits grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides\nin some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found\nnourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below,\nlike the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to\nthat whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the rock,\nand leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut, built\nchiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and\nsecured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss\nmingled with clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its branches,\nwith a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by\nthe door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on\nthe right hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the\nrock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a\nrustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured down the descent\nby a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the\nlittle plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.\n\nBeside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which\nthe roof had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, had never been\nabove sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof, low\nin proportion, rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from\nthe four corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy\npillar. The ribs of two of these arches remained, though the roof\nhad fallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. The\nentrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round\narch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling\nshark's teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient Saxon\narchitecture. A belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars,\nwithin which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of\nwhich had been some time before heard by the Black Knight.\n\nThe whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before\nthe eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the\nnight; since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in\nthe woods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered\npassengers.\n\nAccordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the\nparticulars which we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (the\npatron of travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from\nhis horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his\nlance, in order to arouse attention and gain admittance.\n\nIt was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when\nmade, was unpropitious.\n\n“Pass on, whosoever thou art,” was the answer given by a deep hoarse\nvoice from within the hut, “and disturb not the servant of God and St\nDunstan in his evening devotions.”\n\n“Worthy father,” answered the knight, “here is a poor wanderer\nbewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of exercising\nthy charity and hospitality.”\n\n“Good brother,” replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, “it has pleased\nOur Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object of those virtues,\ninstead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here which even a\ndog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would\ndespise my couch--pass therefore on thy way, and God speed thee.”\n\n“But how,” replied the knight, “is it possible for me to find my way\nthrough such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you,\nreverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least\npoint out to me my road.”\n\n“And I pray you, good Christian brother,” replied the anchorite, “to\ndisturb me no more. You have already interrupted one 'pater', two\n'aves', and a 'credo', which I, miserable sinner that I am, should,\naccording to my vow, have said before moonrise.”\n\n“The road--the road!” vociferated the knight, “give me directions for\nthe road, if I am to expect no more from thee.”\n\n“The road,” replied the hermit, “is easy to hit. The path from the wood\nleads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains have\nabated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou\nwilt take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat\nprecipitous; and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I\nlearn, (for I seldom leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in sundry\nplaces. Thou wilt then keep straight forward---”\n\n“A broken path--a precipice--a ford, and a morass!” said the knight\ninterrupting him,--“Sir Hermit, if you were the holiest that ever wore\nbeard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road\nto-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the\ncountry--ill deserved, as I doubt it is--hast no right to refuse shelter\nto the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the door quickly, or, by\nthe rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.”\n\n“Friend wayfarer,” replied the hermit, “be not importunate; if thou\nputtest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be e'en\nthe worse for you.”\n\nAt this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the\ntraveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious,\nand made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of\nmaking forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to\naid him in his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been\nkennelled. Incensed at this preparation on the hermit's part for making\ngood his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously\nwith his foot, that posts as well as staples shook with violence.\n\nThe anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock,\nnow called out aloud, “Patience, patience--spare thy strength, good\ntraveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my\ndoing so will be little to thy pleasure.”\n\nThe door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built\nman, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood\nbefore the knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in\nthe other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well\nbe termed a club. Two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff,\nstood ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be\nopened. But when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs\nof the knight, who stood without, the hermit, altering probably his\noriginal intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and,\nchanging his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the knight\nto enter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge\nafter sunset, by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were\nabroad, and who gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those\nholy men who spent life in their service.\n\n“The poverty of your cell, good father,” said the knight, looking around\nhim, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely carved\nin oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two\nclumsy articles of furniture--“the poverty of your cell should seem a\nsufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid\nof two trusty dogs, large and strong enough, I think, to pull down a\nstag, and of course, to match with most men.”\n\n“The good keeper of the forest,” said the hermit, “hath allowed me\nthe use of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times shall\nmend.”\n\nHaving said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which\nserved for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet before the\nembers of the fire, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a\nstool upon one side of the table, and beckoned to the knight to do the\nsame upon the other.\n\nThey sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking\nin his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure\nthan was placed opposite to him.\n\n“Reverend hermit,” said the knight, after looking long and fixedly at\nhis host, “were it not to interrupt your devout meditations, I would\npray to know three things of your holiness; first, where I am to put my\nhorse?--secondly, what I can have for supper?--thirdly, where I am to\ntake up my couch for the night?”\n\n“I will reply to you,” said the hermit, “with my finger, it being\nagainst my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose.”\n So saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. “Your\nstable,” said he, “is there--your bed there; and,” reaching down a\nplatter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring\nshelf, and placing it upon the table, he added, “your supper is here.”\n\nThe knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his\nhorse, (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,) unsaddled him\nwith much attention, and spread upon the steed's weary back his own\nmantle.\n\nThe hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as\nwell as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse; for,\nmuttering something about provender left for the keeper's palfrey, he\ndragged out of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before the\nknight's charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of\ndried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the rider's couch.\nThe knight returned him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty done,\nboth resumed their seats by the table, whereon stood the trencher of\npease placed between them. The hermit, after a long grace, which had\nonce been Latin, but of which original language few traces remained,\nexcepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or\nphrase, set example to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large\nmouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a\nboar both in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a\nmiserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill.\n\nThe knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his\nhelmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to\nthe hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue\neyes, remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an\nupper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing\naltogether the look of a bold, daring, and enterprising man, with which\nhis strong form well corresponded.\n\nThe hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest,\nthrew back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man\nin the prime of life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle\nof stiff curled black hair, had something the appearance of a parish\npinfold begirt by its high hedge. The features expressed nothing of\nmonastic austerity, or of ascetic privations; on the contrary, it was\na bold bluff countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned\nforehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter,\nfrom which descended a long and curly black beard. Such a visage,\njoined to the brawny form of the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and\nhaunches, than of pease and pulse. This incongruity did not escape the\nguest. After he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication\nof a mouthful of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary\nto request his pious entertainer to furnish him with some liquor; who\nreplied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest\nwater from the fountain.\n\n“It is from the well of St Dunstan,” said he, “in which, betwixt sun and\nsun, he baptized five hundred heathen Danes and Britons--blessed be his\nname!” And applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a draught\nmuch more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to warrant.\n\n“It seems to me, reverend father,” said the knight, “that the small\nmorsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin\nbeverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more\nfit to win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at\nquarter-staff, or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your\ntime in this desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living upon parched\npease and cold water.”\n\n“Sir Knight,” answered the hermit, “your thoughts, like those of the\nignorant laity, are according to the flesh. It has pleased Our Lady and\nmy patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even\nas the pulse and water was blessed to the children Shadrach, Meshech,\nand Abednego, who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the\nwine and meats which were appointed them by the King of the Saracens.”\n\n“Holy father,” said the knight, “upon whose countenance it hath pleased\nHeaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy\nname?”\n\n“Thou mayst call me,” answered the hermit, “the Clerk of Copmanhurst,\nfor so I am termed in these parts--They add, it is true, the\nepithet holy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such\naddition.--And now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name of my\nhonourable guest?”\n\n“Truly,” said the knight, “Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, men call me in\nthese parts the Black Knight,--many, sir, add to it the epithet of\nSluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.”\n\nThe hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest's reply.\n\n“I see,” said he, “Sir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man of prudence\nand of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monastic fare likes\nthee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of\ncourts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now I bethink me,\nSir Sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left\nthose dogs for my protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left\nme also some food, which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection\nof it had escaped me amid my more weighty meditations.”\n\n“I dare be sworn he did so,” said the knight; “I was convinced that\nthere was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you first doffed\nyour cowl.--Your keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who beheld thy\ngrinders contending with these pease, and thy throat flooded with this\nungenial element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and\nhorse-beverage,” (pointing to the provisions upon the table,) “and\nrefrain from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeper's bounty,\ntherefore, without delay.”\n\nThe hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was\na sort of comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how far he\nshould act prudently in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much\nof bold frankness in the knight's countenance as was possible to be\nexpressed by features. His smile, too, had something in it irresistibly\ncomic, and gave an assurance of faith and loyalty, with which his host\ncould not refrain from sympathizing.\n\nAfter exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further\nside of the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealed with great care\nand some ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into which\nthis aperture gave admittance, he brought a large pasty, baked in a\npewter platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed before\nhis guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost no time in making\nhimself acquainted with its contents.\n\n“How long is it since the good keeper has been here?” said the knight\nto his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this\nreinforcement to the hermit's good cheer.\n\n“About two months,” answered the father hastily.\n\n“By the true Lord,” answered the knight, “every thing in your hermitage\nis miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been sworn that the fat buck\nwhich furnished this venison had been running on foot within the week.”\n\nThe hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and,\nmoreover, he made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of\nthe pasty, on which his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare\nin which his previous profession of abstinence left him no pretext for\njoining.\n\n“I have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,” said the knight, stopping short\nof a sudden, “and I bethink me it is a custom there that every host who\nentertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food, by\npartaking of it along with him. Far be it from me to suspect so holy a\nman of aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you\nwould you comply with this Eastern custom.”\n\n“To ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart\nfrom my rule,” replied the hermit. And as there were no forks in those\ndays, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.\n\nThe ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry\nbetween the guest and the entertainer which should display the best\nappetite; and although the former had probably fasted longest, yet the\nhermit fairly surpassed him.\n\n“Holy Clerk,” said the knight, when his hunger was appeased, “I would\ngage my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that that same honest\nkeeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of\nwine, or a runlet of canary, or some such trifle, by way of ally to this\nnoble pasty. This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally unworthy\nto dwell in the memory of so rigid an anchorite; yet, I think, were you\nto search yonder crypt once more, you would find that I am right in my\nconjecture.”\n\nThe hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he\nproduced a leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts. He\nalso brought forth two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of\nthe urus, and hooped with silver. Having made this goodly provision\nfor washing down the supper, he seemed to think no farther ceremonious\nscruple necessary on his part; but filling both cups, and saying, in the\nSaxon fashion, “'Waes hael', Sir Sluggish Knight!” he emptied his own at\na draught.\n\n“'Drink hael', Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!” answered the warrior, and did\nhis host reason in a similar brimmer.\n\n“Holy Clerk,” said the stranger, after the first cup was thus swallowed,\n“I cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and sinews as\nthine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a trencher-man,\nshould think of abiding by himself in this wilderness. In my judgment,\nyou are fitter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the fat and\ndrinking of the strong, than to live here upon pulse and water, or even\nupon the charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I should find\nmyself both disport and plenty out of the king's deer. There is many a\ngoodly herd in these forests, and a buck will never be missed that goes\nto the use of Saint Dunstan's chaplain.”\n\n“Sir Sluggish Knight,” replied the Clerk, “these are dangerous words,\nand I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the king and law,\nand were I to spoil my liege's game, I should be sure of the prison,\nand, an my gown saved me not, were in some peril of hanging.”\n\n“Nevertheless, were I as thou,” said the knight, “I would take my walk\nby moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed, and ever\nand anon,--as I pattered my prayers,--I would let fly a shaft among the\nherds of dun deer that feed in the glades--Resolve me, Holy Clerk, hast\nthou never practised such a pastime?”\n\n“Friend Sluggard,” answered the hermit, “thou hast seen all that can\nconcern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than he deserves who\ntakes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy\nthe good which God sends thee, than to be impertinently curious how it\ncomes. Fill thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further\nimpertinent enquiries, put me to show that thou couldst hardly have made\ngood thy lodging had I been earnest to oppose thee.”\n\n“By my faith,” said the knight, “thou makest me more curious than ever!\nThou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I will know more of\nthee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to\none whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met with.”\n\n“Sir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,” said the hermit; “respecting thy\nvalour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thy discretion. If thou\nwilt take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all friendship and\nbrotherly love, such sufficing penance and complete absolution, that\nthou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of\ncuriosity.”\n\nThe knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.\n\n“There is none,” replied the hermit, “from the scissors of Delilah, and\nthe tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which I am not\na match for thee--But, if I am to make the election, what sayst thou,\ngood friend, to these trinkets?”\n\nThus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple\nof broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by the yeomanry of the\nperiod. The knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second\nplace of concealment was furnished with two or three good long-bows, a\ncross-bow, a bundle of bolts for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves of\narrows for the former. A harp, and other matters of a very uncanonical\nappearance, were also visible when this dark recess was opened.\n\n“I promise thee, brother Clerk,” said he, “I will ask thee no more\noffensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answer to all\nmy enquiries; and I see a weapon there” (here he stooped and took out\nthe harp) “on which I would more gladly prove my skill with thee, than\nat the sword and buckler.”\n\n“I hope, Sir Knight,” said the hermit, “thou hast given no good reason\nfor thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspect thee\ngrievously. Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy\nmanhood to the proof without thine own free will. Sit thee down, then,\nand fill thy cup; let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest ever\na good lay, thou shalt be welcome to a nook of pasty at Copmanhurst so\nlong as I serve the chapel of St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be\ntill I change my grey covering for one of green turf. But come, fill a\nflagon, for it will crave some time to tune the harp; and nought pitches\nthe voice and sharpens the ear like a cup of wine. For my part, I\nlove to feel the grape at my very finger-ends before they make the\nharp-strings tinkle.” [22]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n     At eve, within yon studious nook,\n     I ope my brass-embossed book,\n     Portray'd with many a holy deed\n     Of martyrs crown'd with heavenly meed;\n     Then, as my taper waxes dim,\n     Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.\n     * * * * *\n     Who but would cast his pomp away,\n     To take my staff and amice grey,\n     And to the world's tumultuous stage,\n     Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?\n     --Warton\n\nNotwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his\nguest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp\nto harmony.\n\n“Methinks, holy father,” said he, “the instrument wants one string, and\nthe rest have been somewhat misused.”\n\n“Ay, mark'st thou that?” replied the hermit; “that shows thee a master\nof the craft. Wine and wassail,” he added, gravely casting up his\neyes--“all the fault of wine and wassail!--I told Allan-a-Dale, the\nnorthern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touched it after\nthe seventh cup, but he would not be controlled--Friend, I drink to thy\nsuccessful performance.”\n\nSo saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time\nshaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.\n\nThe knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order,\nand after a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a\n“sirvente” in the language of “oc”, or a “lai” in the language of “oui”,\nor a “virelai”, or a ballad in the vulgar English. [23]\n\n“A ballad, a ballad,” said the hermit, “against all the 'ocs' and 'ouis'\nof France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downright English\nwas my patron St Dunstan, and scorned 'oc' and 'oui', as he would have\nscorned the parings of the devil's hoof--downright English alone shall\nbe sung in this cell.”\n\n“I will assay, then,” said the knight, “a ballad composed by a Saxon\nglee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.”\n\nIt speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of\nthe minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under\nthe best instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice\nwhich had little compass, and was naturally rough rather than mellow,\nand, in short, had done all that culture can do in supplying natural\ndeficiencies. His performance, therefore, might have been termed very\nrespectable by abler judges than the hermit, especially as the knight\nthrew into the notes now a degree of spirit, and now of plaintive\nenthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the verses which he sung.\n\n\n     THE CRUSADER'S RETURN.\n\n     1.\n\n     High deeds achieved of knightly fame,\n     From Palestine the champion came;\n     The cross upon his shoulders borne,\n     Battle and blast had dimm'd and torn.\n     Each dint upon his batter'd shield\n     Was token of a foughten field;\n     And thus, beneath his lady's bower,\n     He sung as fell the twilight hour:--\n\n     2.\n\n     “Joy to the fair!--thy knight behold,\n     Return'd from yonder land of gold;\n     No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,\n     Save his good arms and battle-steed\n     His spurs, to dash against a foe,\n     His lance and sword to lay him low;\n     Such all the trophies of his toil,\n     Such--and the hope of Tekla's smile!\n\n     3.\n\n     “Joy to the fair! whose constant knight\n     Her favour fired to feats of might;\n     Unnoted shall she not remain,\n     Where meet the bright and noble train;\n     Minstrel shall sing and herald tell--\n     'Mark yonder maid of beauty well,\n     'Tis she for whose bright eyes were won\n     The listed field at Askalon!\n\n     4.\n\n     “'Note well her smile!--it edged the blade\n     Which fifty wives to widows made,\n     When, vain his strength and Mahound's spell,\n     Iconium's turban'd Soldan fell.\n     Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glow\n     Half shows, half shades, her neck of snow?\n     Twines not of them one golden thread,\n     But for its sake a Paynim bled.'\n\n     5.\n\n     “Joy to the fair!--my name unknown,\n     Each deed, and all its praise thine own\n     Then, oh! unbar this churlish gate,\n     The night dew falls, the hour is late.\n     Inured to Syria's glowing breath,\n     I feel the north breeze chill as death;\n     Let grateful love quell maiden shame,\n     And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.”\n\nDuring this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a\nfirst-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back\nupon his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and\ntwisting his thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon,\nbalancing his expanded palms, he gently flourished them in time to the\nmusic. At one or two favourite cadences, he threw in a little assistance\nof his own, where the knight's voice seemed unable to carry the air\nso high as his worshipful taste approved. When the song was ended, the\nanchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well sung.\n\n“And yet,” said he, “I think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough\nwith the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties.\nWhat took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to\nfind his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his\nserenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a\ncat in the gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee,\nto the success of all true lovers--I fear you are none,” he added, on\nobserving that the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these\nrepeated draughts) qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.\n\n“Why,” said the knight, “did you not tell me that this water was from\nthe well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?”\n\n“Ay, truly,” said the hermit, “and many a hundred of pagans did he\nbaptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing\nshould be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well\nas any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.”\n\nAnd so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with\nthe following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus,\nappropriate to an old English ditty. [24]\n\n\n     THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.\n\n     1.\n\n     I'll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,\n     To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;\n     But ne'er shall you find, should you search till you tire,\n     So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.\n\n     2.\n\n     Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career,\n     And is brought home at even-song prick'd through with a spear;\n     I confess him in haste--for his lady desires\n     No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar's.\n\n     3.\n\n     Your monarch?--Pshaw! many a prince has been known\n     To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,\n     But which of us e'er felt the idle desire\n     To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!\n\n     4.\n\n     The Friar has walk'd out, and where'er he has gone,\n     The land and its fatness is mark'd for his own;\n     He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,\n     For every man's house is the Barefooted Friar's.\n\n     5.\n\n     He's expected at noon, and no wight till he comes\n     May profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums\n     For the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,\n     Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.\n\n     6.\n\n     He's expected at night, and the pasty's made hot,\n     They broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot,\n     And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,\n     Ere he lack'd a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.\n\n     7.\n\n     Long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,\n     The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;\n     For to gather life's roses, unscathed by the briar,\n     Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.\n\n\n“By my troth,” said the knight, “thou hast sung well and lustily, and in\nhigh praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy Clerk,\nare you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your\nuncanonical pastimes?”\n\n“I uncanonical!” answered the hermit; “I scorn the charge--I scorn it\nwith my heels!--I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly--Two masses\ndaily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, 'aves, credos,\npaters'---”\n\n“Excepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,” said his\nguest.\n\n“'Exceptis excipiendis'” replied the hermit, “as our old abbot taught me\nto say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept every punctilio\nof mine order.”\n\n“True, holy father,” said the knight; “but the devil is apt to keep\nan eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring\nlion.”\n\n“Let him roar here if he dares,” said the friar; “a touch of my cord\nwill make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I\nnever feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint\nDunstan, Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert,\nSaint Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor\nmerits to speed, I defy every devil of them, come cut and long\ntail.--But to let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects,\nmy friend, until after morning vespers.”\n\nHe changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the\nparties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels\nwere interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.\n\nThe occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the\nadventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we\ndo not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with\nany one personage of our drama.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n     Away! our journey lies through dell and dingle,\n     Where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,\n     Where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,\n     Chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley--\n     Up and away!--for lovely paths are these\n     To tread, when the glad Sun is on his throne\n     Less pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthia's lamp\n     With doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.\n     --Ettrick Forest\n\nWhen Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at\nAshby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of\nhis own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not\nbring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son\nwhom he had renounced and disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to\nkeep an eye upon him; and directed that officer, with two of his serfs,\nto convey Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. Oswald,\nhowever, was anticipated in this good office. The crowd dispersed,\nindeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt was in vain that Cedric's cupbearer looked around for his young\nmaster--he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but\nhimself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him\nfrom the spot. Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons were very superstitious)\nmight have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoe's\ndisappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired\nlike a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant\nGurth. Anxious concerning his master's fate, and in despair at his\nsudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him\neverywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which\nhis own safety depended. Oswald deemed it his duty to secure Gurth, as a\nfugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.\n\nRenewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only\ninformation which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders\nwas, that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired\ngrooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators,\nwhich had immediately transported him out of the press. Oswald, on\nreceiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his master for\nfarther instructions, carrying along with him Gurth, whom he considered\nin some sort as a deserter from the service of Cedric.\n\nThe Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions\nconcerning his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the\npatriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he\ninformed that Ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands,\nthan the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his\nfate, gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at\nwhat he termed Wilfred's filial disobedience.\n\n“Let him wander his way,” said he--“let those leech his wounds for whose\nsake he encountered them. He is fitter to do the juggling tricks of\nthe Norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his English\nancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his\ncountry.”\n\n“If to maintain the honour of ancestry,” said Rowena, who was present,\n“it is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution--to be\nboldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I know no voice,\nsave his father's---”\n\n“Be silent, Lady Rowena!--on this subject only I hear you not. Prepare\nyourself for the Prince's festival: we have been summoned thither with\nunwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty\nNormans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of Hastings.\nThither will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little\nthe fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a Saxon.”\n\n“Thither,” said Rowena, “do I NOT go; and I pray you to beware, lest\nwhat you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of\nheart.”\n\n“Remain at home, then, ungrateful lady,” answered Cedric; “thine is the\nhard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an\nidle and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and with\nhim attend the banquet of John of Anjou.”\n\nHe went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned\nthe principal events. Immediately upon retiring from the castle, the\nSaxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the\nbustle which attended their doing so, that Cedric, for the first time,\ncast his eyes upon the deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned from\nthe banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a\npretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.\n\n“The gyves!” he said, “the gyves!--Oswald--Hundibert!--Dogs and\nvillains!--why leave ye the knave unfettered?”\n\nWithout daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with\na halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. He submitted to the\noperation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful\nlook at his master, he said, “This comes of loving your flesh and blood\nbetter than mine own.”\n\n“To horse, and forward!” said Cedric.\n\n“It is indeed full time,” said the noble Athelstane; “for, if we\nride not the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoff's preparations for a\nrere-supper [25] will be altogether spoiled.”\n\nThe travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St\nWithold's before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot, himself of\nancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and\nexuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late,\nor rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host\nthe next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection.\n\nAs the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened\nsomewhat alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people of Europe, were most\naddicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions\ncan be traced most of those notions upon such subjects, still to be\nfound among our popular antiquities. For the Normans being a mixed race,\nand better informed according to the information of the times, had lost\nmost of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought\nfrom Scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such\ntopics.\n\nIn the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired\nby no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which,\nsitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the\ngate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro,\nseemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.\n\n“I like not that music, father Cedric,” said Athelstane; for by this\ntitle of respect he was accustomed to address him.\n\n“Nor I either, uncle,” said Wamba; “I greatly fear we shall have to pay\nthe piper.”\n\n“In my mind,” said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbot's good\nale (for Burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a\nfavourable impression,--“in my mind we had better turn back, and abide\nwith the Abbot until the afternoon. It is unlucky to travel where your\npath is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have\neaten your next meal.”\n\n“Away!” said Cedric, impatiently; “the day is already too short for\nour journey. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runaway slave\nGurth, a useless fugitive like its master.”\n\nSo saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the\ninterruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor Fangs--for\nFangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen\nexpedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way,\nrejoicing at his reappearance. The javelin inflicted a wound upon the\nanimal's shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and\nFangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurth's heart\nswelled within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful\nadherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself\nreceived. Having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes,\nhe said to Wamba, who, seeing his master's ill humour had prudently\nretreated to the rear, “I pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes\nwith the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will\nnot let me help myself one way or another.”\n\nWamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for\nsome time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence. At length he\ncould repress his feelings no longer.\n\n“Friend Wamba,” said he, “of all those who are fools enough to serve\nCedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to\nhim. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear\nwill Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the head from me--he may\nscourge me--he may load me with irons--but henceforth he shall never\ncompel me either to love or to obey him. Go to him, then, and tell him\nthat Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.”\n\n“Assuredly,” said Wamba, “fool as I am, I shall not do your fool's\nerrand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou\nknowest he does not always miss his mark.”\n\n“I care not,” replied Gurth, “how soon he makes a mark of me. Yesterday\nhe left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day he has striven to\nkill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me\nkindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold, St Edward the Confessor,\nand every other Saxon saint in the calendar,” (for Cedric never swore\nby any that was not of Saxon lineage, and all his household had the same\nlimited devotion,) “I will never forgive him!”\n\n“To my thinking now,” said the Jester, who was frequently wont to act\nas peace-maker in the family, “our master did not propose to hurt Fangs,\nbut only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups,\nas thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have done,\nbut Fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch,\nwhich I will be bound to heal with a penny's breadth of tar.”\n\n“If I thought so,” said Gurth--“if I could but think so--but no--I saw\nthe javelin was well aimed--I heard it whizz through the air with all\nthe wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it\nhad pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark.\nBy the hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!”\n\nAnd the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts\nof the Jester could again induce him to break.\n\nMeanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed\ntogether on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal\nfamily, on the feuds and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the\nchance which there was that the oppressed Saxons might be able to\nfree themselves from the yoke of the Normans, or at least to elevate\nthemselves into national consequence and independence, during the civil\nconvulsions which were likely to ensue. On this subject Cedric was all\nanimation. The restoration of the independence of his race was the idol\nof his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness\nand the interests of his own son. But, in order to achieve this great\nrevolution in favour of the native English, it was necessary that they\nshould be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head.\nThe necessity of choosing their chief from the Saxon blood-royal was not\nonly evident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those\nwhom Cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes. Athelstane\nhad this quality at least; and though he had few mental accomplishments\nor talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a goodly person,\nwas no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises, and seemed\nwilling to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than himself.\nAbove all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be\ngood-natured. But whatever pretensions Athelstane had to be considered\nas head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed\nto prefer to the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her descent from\nAlfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom,\ncourage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed\ncountrymen.\n\nIt would have been no difficult thing for Cedric, had he been so\ndisposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as\nformidable at least as any of the others. To counterbalance their royal\ndescent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted\nattachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of The Saxon,\nand his birth was inferior to none, excepting only that of Athelstane\nand his ward. These qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest\nshade of selfishness; and, instead of dividing yet farther his weakened\nnation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of\nCedric's plan to extinguish that which already existed, by promoting a\nmarriage betwixt Rowena and Athelstane. An obstacle occurred to this his\nfavourite project, in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and\nhence the original cause of the banishment of Wilfred from the house of\nhis father.\n\nThis stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfred's\nabsence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he was\ndisappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the\nmode in which his ward had been educated. Cedric, to whom the name of\nAlfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of\nthat great monarch with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps, was\nin those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. Rowena's will had\nbeen in almost all cases a law to his household; and Cedric himself, as\nif determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within\nthat little circle at least, seemed to take a pride in acting as the\nfirst of her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise not only of free\nwill, but despotic authority, Rowena was, by her previous education,\ndisposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her\naffections, or dispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to\nassert her independence in a case in which even those females who have\nbeen trained up to obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to\ndispute the authority of guardians and parents. The opinions which she\nfelt strongly, she avowed boldly; and Cedric, who could not free himself\nfrom his habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally at a loss how\nto enforce his authority of guardian.\n\nIt was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a\nvisionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered\nhis plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned,\ncould it have been achieved. Without attempting to conceal her avowed\npreference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured\nknight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than\nshare a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now\nbegan, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly\nto detest.\n\nNevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of women's constancy was far from\nstrong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the\nproposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important\nservice to the Saxon cause. The sudden and romantic appearance of his\nson in the lists at Ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a death's\nblow to his hopes. His paternal affection, it is true, had for an\ninstant gained the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had\nreturned in full force, and under their joint operation, he was now bent\nupon making a determined effort for the union of Athelstane and Rowena,\ntogether with expediting those other measures which seemed necessary to\nforward the restoration of Saxon independence.\n\nOn this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without\nhaving reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur, that he\nshould have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an\naction. Athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and loved to have\nhis ears tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right\nby inheritance to homage and sovereignty. But his petty vanity was\nsufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his\nimmediate attendants, and of the Saxons who approached him. If he had\nthe courage to encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going\nto seek it; and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by\nCedric concerning the claim of the Saxons to independence, and was still\nmore easily convinced of his own title to reign over them when that\nindependence should be attained, yet when the means of asserting these\nrights came to be discussed, he was still “Athelstane the Unready,”\n slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising. The warm and\nimpassioned exhortations of Cedric had as little effect upon his\nimpassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the water, which produce\na little sound and smoke, and are instantly extinguished.\n\nIf, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade,\nor to hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his ward Rowena, he\nreceived little more satisfaction from conferring with her. For, as his\npresence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite\nattendant upon the gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha failed not to\nrevenge both her mistress and herself, by recurring to the overthrow of\nAthelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject which could greet\nthe ears of Cedric. To this sturdy Saxon, therefore, the day's journey\nwas fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort; so that\nhe more than once internally cursed the tournament, and him who had\nproclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever thinking of going\nthither.\n\nAt noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a\nwoodland shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partake of some\nprovisions, with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter mule.\nTheir repast was a pretty long one; and these several interruptions\nrendered it impossible for them to hope to reach Rotherwood without\ntravelling all night, a conviction which induced them to proceed on\ntheir way at a more hasty pace than they had hitherto used.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n     A train of armed men, some noble dame\n     Escorting, (so their scatter'd words discover'd,\n     As unperceived I hung upon their rear,)\n     Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night\n     Within the castle.\n     --Orra, a Tragedy\n\nThe travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were\nabout to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the\nnumber of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair,\nand who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid\ndefiance to the feeble police of the period. From these rovers, however,\nnotwithstanding the lateness of the hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted\nthemselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba\nand Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester\nand the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late\nthrough the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and\ncharacter, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of\nthe forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life,\nwere chiefly peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally\nsupposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.\n\nAs the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated\ncries for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence\nthey came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the\nground, beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish\nfashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong\nto the same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the\ndeepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange\ndisaster.\n\nTo the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some\ntime only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the\nOld Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming\nto smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When he began\nto come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it\nwas our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired\na body-guard of six men at Ashby, together with mules for carrying the\nlitter of a sick friend. This party had undertaken to escort him as\nfar as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but having received\ninformation from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws\nlying in wait in the woods before them, Isaac's mercenaries had not only\ntaken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore the\nlitter and left the Jew and his daughter without the means either of\ndefence or of retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the\nbanditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them.\n“Would it but please your valours,” added Isaac, in a tone of deep\nhumiliation, “to permit the poor Jews to travel under your safeguard,\nI swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred\nupon a child of Israel since the days of our captivity, which shall be\nmore gratefully acknowledged.”\n\n“Dog of a Jew!” said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty\nkind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling\noffences, “dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at\nthe tilt-yard? Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost\nlist, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such\nas thee, who rob all the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them\nright honest folk.”\n\nCedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. “We shall\ndo better,” said he, “to leave them two of our attendants and two horses\nto convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength\nbut little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and the aid of\nthose who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those\nrunagates.”\n\nRowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so\nnear them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca\nsuddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the\nattendants to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the\nOriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena's\ngarment. Then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her\nin the great name of the God whom they both worshipped, and by that\nrevelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai, in which they both believed,\nthat she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward\nunder their safeguard. “It is not for myself that I pray this favour,”\n said Rebecca; “nor is it even for that poor old man. I know that to\nwrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with the\nChristians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the\ndesert, or in the field? But it is in the name of one dear to many,\nand dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be\ntransported with care and tenderness under your protection. For, if evil\nchance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret\nfor denying that which I ask of you.”\n\nThe noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it\ndouble weight with the fair Saxon.\n\n“The man is old and feeble,” she said to her guardian, “the maiden young\nand beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life--Jews though\nthey be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let them\nunload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the\nserfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for\nthe old man and his daughter.”\n\nCedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added\nthe condition, “that they should travel in the rear of the whole party,\nwhere Wamba,” he said, “might attend them with his shield of boar's\nbrawn.”\n\n“I have left my shield in the tilt-yard,” answered the Jester, “as has\nbeen the fate of many a better knight than myself.”\n\nAthelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the\nlast day of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same\nproportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling\nsuitor, requested Rebecca to ride by her side.\n\n“It were not fit I should do so,” answered Rebecca, with proud humility,\n“where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.”\n\nBy this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single\nword “outlaws” rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach\nof twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth\nwas taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed\nupon the Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was\nso negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba,\nthat Gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from\nbondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the\nparty.\n\nThe bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was\nmissed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind\na servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him\nunder his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them\nthat Gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate\nexpectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held\nconvenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.\n\nThe path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to\nadmit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began\nto descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken,\nswampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and Athelstane, who\nwere at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at\nthis pass; but neither of them having had much practice in war, no\nbetter mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they\nshould hasten through the defile as fast as possible. Advancing,\ntherefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a\npart of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank,\nand rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and\nill-prepared condition, it was impossible to offer effectual resistance.\nThe shout of “A white dragon!--a white dragon!--Saint George for merry\nEngland!” war-cries adopted by the assailants, as belonging to their\nassumed character of Saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on\nevery side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which\nseemed to multiply their numbers.\n\nBoth the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each\nunder circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant\nthat an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which,\ntaking better effect than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the\nman against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far\nsuccessful, Cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his sword\nat the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that\nhis weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he\nwas disarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made\nprisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who\ncrowded around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having\nbeen seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could\ndraw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.\n\nThe attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the\nfate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while\nthe Lady Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his\ndaughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.\n\nOf all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the\noccasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. He\npossessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was\njust drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like\na lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though\nineffectual attempt to succour his master. Finding himself overpowered,\nthe Jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the\nthicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, escaped from the scene\nof action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found himself safe,\nhesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the\ncaptivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.\n\n“I have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,” he said to himself,\n“but I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that\nI have it.”\n\nAs he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in\na low and cautious tone, “Wamba!” and, at the same time, a dog, which he\nrecognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. “Gurth!” answered\nWamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before\nhim.\n\n“What is the matter?” said he eagerly; “what mean these cries, and that\nclashing of swords?”\n\n“Only a trick of the times,” said Wamba; “they are all prisoners.”\n\n“Who are prisoners?” exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.\n\n“My lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.”\n\n“In the name of God!” said Gurth, “how came they prisoners?--and to\nwhom?”\n\n“Our master was too ready to fight,” said the Jester; “and Athelstane\nwas not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they are\nprisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled\nabout on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your\nswine. And I would laugh at it,” said the honest Jester, “if I could for\nweeping.” And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.\n\nGurth's countenance kindled--“Wamba,” he said, “thou hast a weapon,\nand thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,--we are only two--but a\nsudden attack from men of resolution will do much--follow me!”\n\n“Whither?--and for what purpose?” said the Jester.\n\n“To rescue Cedric.”\n\n“But you have renounced his service but now,” said Wamba.\n\n“That,” said Gurth, “was but while he was fortunate--follow me!”\n\nAs the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his\nappearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms,\nWamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just\nassailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering\nbaldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it\nsupported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice\nand manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise Locksley\nthe yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous\ncircumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.\n\n“What is the meaning of all this,” said he, “or who is it that rifle,\nand ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?”\n\n“You may look at their cassocks close by,” said Wamba, “and see whether\nthey be thy children's coats or no--for they are as like thine own, as\none green pea-cod is to another.”\n\n“I will learn that presently,” answered Locksley; “and I charge ye, on\nperil of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until\nI have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your\nmasters.--Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as possible.”\n\nSo saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from\nhis cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch,\nand, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his\npurposes of reconnoitring.\n\n“Shall we stand fast, Gurth?” said Wamba; “or shall we e'en give him\nleg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too\nmuch in readiness, to be himself a true man.”\n\n“Let him be the devil,” said Gurth, “an he will. We can be no worse of\nwaiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have\ngiven them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.\nBesides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst\nmen in the world to have to deal with.”\n\nThe yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.\n\n“Friend Gurth,” he said, “I have mingled among yon men, and have learnt\nto whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think,\nno chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their\nprisoners. For three men to attempt them at this moment, were little\nelse than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such,\nplaced sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. But I\ntrust soon to gather such a force, as may act in defiance of all their\nprecautions; you are both servants, and, as I think, faithful servants,\nof Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall\nnot want English hands to help him in this extremity. Come then with me,\nuntil I gather more aid.”\n\nSo saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the\njester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wamba's humour to\ntravel long in silence.\n\n“I think,” said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still\ncarried, “that I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that\nnot so long since as Christmas.”\n\n“And I,” said Gurth, “could take it on my halidome, that I have heard\nthe voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and\nthat the moon is not three days older since I did so.”\n\n“Mine honest friends,” replied the yeoman, “who, or what I am, is little\nto the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have reason\nto think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether\nI am known by one name or another--or whether I can draw a bow as well\nor better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in\nsunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern\nyou, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.”\n\n“Our heads are in the lion's mouth,” said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth,\n“get them out how we can.”\n\n“Hush--be silent,” said Gurth. “Offend him not by thy folly, and I trust\nsincerely that all will go well.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n     When autumn nights were long and drear,\n     And forest walks were dark and dim,\n     How sweetly on the pilgrim's ear\n     Was wont to steal the hermit's hymn\n\n     Devotion borrows Music's tone,\n     And Music took Devotion's wing;\n     And, like the bird that hails the sun,\n     They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.\n     The Hermit of St Clement's Well\n\nIt was after three hours' good walking that the servants of Cedric, with\ntheir mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in\nthe centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing\nits twisted branches in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five\nyeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked\nto and fro in the moonlight shade.\n\nUpon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the\nalarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. Six\narrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which\nthe travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised, was\nwelcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and\nfears of a rough reception at once subsided.\n\n“Where is the Miller?” was his first question.\n\n“On the road towards Rotherham.”\n\n“With how many?” demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.\n\n“With six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.”\n\n“Devoutly spoken,” said Locksley; “and where is Allan-a-Dale?”\n\n“Walked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of\nJorvaulx.”\n\n“That is well thought on also,” replied the Captain;--“and where is the\nFriar?”\n\n“In his cell.”\n\n“Thither will I go,” said Locksley. “Disperse and seek your companions.\nCollect what force you can, for there's game afoot that must be hunted\nhard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.--And stay,” he\nadded, “I have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole--Two of\nyou take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of\nFront-de-Boeuf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such\nguise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither--Watch them\nclosely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force,\nour honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do so.\nKeep a close watch on them therefore; and dispatch one of your comrades,\nthe lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout.”\n\nThey promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on\ntheir different errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two\ncompanions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some\nfear, pursued their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.\n\nWhen they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the\nreverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well\nsuited to ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, “If this be the\nhabitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the\nchurch the farther from God.--And by my coxcomb,” he added, “I think it\nbe even so--Hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in\nthe hermitage!”\n\nIn fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent\nof their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was\nthe burden:--\n\n     “Come, trowl the brown bowl to me,\n     Bully boy, bully boy,\n     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me:\n     Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,\n     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me.”\n\n“Now, that is not ill sung,” said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his\nown flourishes to help out the chorus. “But who, in the saint's name,\never expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit's\ncell at midnight!”\n\n“Marry, that should I,” said Gurth, “for the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst\nis a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk.\nMen say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he\nwill be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better\norder.”\n\nWhile they were thus speaking, Locksley's loud and repeated knocks had\nat length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. “By my beads,” said the\nhermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, “here come more benighted\nguests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly\nexercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be\nthose malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which I\nhave been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three\nshort hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike alien to\nmy profession and my disposition.”\n\n“Base calumniators!” replied the knight; “I would I had the chastising\nof them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their\nenemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak\nto through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.”\n\n“Get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as\nthy nature will permit,” said the hermit, “while I remove these pewter\nflagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to\ndrown the clatter--for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady--strike into\nthe tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words--I\nscarce know them myself.”\n\nSo saying, he struck up a thundering “De profundis clamavi”, under cover\nof which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the knight,\nlaughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host\nwith his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.\n\n“What devil's matins are you after at this hour?” said a voice from\nwithout.\n\n“Heaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!” said the hermit, whose own noise,\nand perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents\nwhich were tolerably familiar to him--“Wend on your way, in the name of\nGod and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy\nbrother.”\n\n“Mad priest,” answered the voice from without, “open to Locksley!”\n\n“All's safe--all's right,” said the hermit to his companion.\n\n“But who is he?” said the Black Knight; “it imports me much to know.”\n\n“Who is he?” answered the hermit; “I tell thee he is a friend.”\n\n“But what friend?” answered the knight; “for he may be friend to thee\nand none of mine?”\n\n“What friend?” replied the hermit; “that, now, is one of the questions\nthat is more easily asked than answered. What friend?--why, he is, now\nthat I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of a\nwhile since.”\n\n“Ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,” replied the knight,\n“I doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it from its\nhinges.”\n\nThe dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the\ncommencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice\nof him who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they\nscratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission.\nThe hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with his\ntwo companions.\n\n“Why, hermit,” was the yeoman's first question as soon as he beheld the\nknight, “what boon companion hast thou here?”\n\n“A brother of our order,” replied the friar, shaking his head; “we have\nbeen at our orisons all night.”\n\n“He is a monk of the church militant, I think,” answered Locksley; “and\nthere be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down\nthe rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our\nmerry men, whether clerk or layman.--But,” he added, taking him a step\naside, “art thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?\nHast thou forgot our articles?”\n\n“Not know him!” replied the friar, boldly, “I know him as well as the\nbeggar knows his dish.”\n\n“And what is his name, then?” demanded Locksley.\n\n“His name,” said the hermit--“his name is Sir Anthony of\nScrabelstone--as if I would drink with a man, and did not know his\nname!”\n\n“Thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,” said the woodsman,\n“and, I fear, prating more than enough too.”\n\n“Good yeoman,” said the knight, coming forward, “be not wroth with my\nmerry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have\ncompelled from him if he had refused it.”\n\n“Thou compel!” said the friar; “wait but till have changed this grey\ngown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring twelve\nupon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.”\n\nWhile he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close\nblack buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a\ncassock of green, and hose of the same colour. “I pray thee truss my\npoints,” said he to Wamba, “and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy\nlabour.”\n\n“Gramercy for thy sack,” said Wamba; “but think'st thou it is lawful\nfor me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful\nforester?”\n\n“Never fear,” said the hermit; “I will but confess the sins of my green\ncloak to my greyfriar's frock, and all shall be well again.”\n\n“Amen!” answered the Jester; “a broadcloth penitent should have a\nsackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into\nthe bargain.”\n\nSo saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the\nendless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the\ndoublet were then termed.\n\nWhile they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart,\nand addressed him thus:--“Deny it not, Sir Knight--you are he who\ndecided the victory to the advantage of the English against the\nstrangers on the second day of the tournament at Ashby.”\n\n“And what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?” replied the knight.\n\n“I should in that case hold you,” replied the yeoman, “a friend to the\nweaker party.”\n\n“Such is the duty of a true knight at least,” replied the Black\nChampion; “and I would not willingly that there were reason to think\notherwise of me.”\n\n“But for my purpose,” said the yeoman, “thou shouldst be as well a\ngood Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of,\nconcerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially\nthat of a true-born native of England.”\n\n“You can speak to no one,” replied the knight, “to whom England, and the\nlife of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.”\n\n“I would willingly believe so,” said the woodsman, “for never had this\ncountry such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and\nI will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be'st really\nthat which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band\nof villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made\nthemselves master of the person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric\nthe Saxon, together with his ward, and his friend Athelstane of\nConingsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest,\ncalled Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and a good\nEnglishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?”\n\n“I am bound by my vow to do so,” replied the knight; “but I would\nwillingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?”\n\n“I am,” said the forester, “a nameless man; but I am the friend of my\ncountry, and of my country's friends--With this account of me you must\nfor the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you yourself\ndesire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word, when\npledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.”\n\n“I willingly believe it,” said the knight; “I have been accustomed\nto study men's countenances, and I can read in thine honesty and\nresolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid\nthee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I trust\nwe shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.”\n\n“So,” said Wamba to Gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the\nJester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the\nconclusion of the conversation,--“So we have got a new ally?--l trust\nthe valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the\nhermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a\nborn deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.”\n\n“Hold thy peace, Wamba,” said Gurth; “it may all be as thou dost guess;\nbut were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to\nset at liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have\nreligion enough to refuse the foul fiend's offer, and bid him get behind\nme.”\n\nThe friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and\nbuckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He\nleft his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the\ndoor, deposited the key under the threshold.\n\n“Art thou in condition to do good service, friar,” said Locksley, “or\ndoes the brown bowl still run in thy head?”\n\n“Not more than a drought of St Dunstan's fountain will allay,” answered\nthe priest; “something there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of\ninstability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.”\n\nSo saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of\nthe fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white\nmoonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the\nspring.\n\n“When didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of\nCopmanhurst?” said the Black Knight.\n\n“Never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal\nvent,” replied the friar, “and so left me nothing to drink but my\npatron's bounty here.”\n\nThen plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them\nall marks of the midnight revel.\n\nThus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan\nround his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,\nexclaiming at the same time, “Where be those false ravishers, who carry\noff wenches against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if I\nam not man enough for a dozen of them.”\n\n“Swearest thou, Holy Clerk?” said the Black Knight.\n\n“Clerk me no Clerks,” replied the transformed priest; “by Saint George\nand the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my\nback--When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo\na lass, with any blithe forester in the West Riding.”\n\n“Come on, Jack Priest,” said Locksley, “and be silent; thou art as noisy\nas a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone to\nbed.--Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it--I say, come\non, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we\nare to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.”\n\n“What! is it Front-de-Boeuf,” said the Black Knight, “who has stopt on\nthe king's highway the king's liege subjects?--Is he turned thief and\noppressor?”\n\n“Oppressor he ever was,” said Locksley.\n\n“And for thief,” said the priest, “I doubt if ever he were even half so\nhonest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.”\n\n“Move on, priest, and be silent,” said the yeoman; “it were better you\nled the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left\nunsaid, both in decency and prudence.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n     Alas, how many hours and years have past,\n     Since human forms have round this table sate,\n     Or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam'd!\n     Methinks, I hear the sound of time long pass'd\n     Still murmuring o'er us, in the lofty void\n     Of these dark arches, like the ling'ring voices\n     Of those who long within their graves have slept.\n     Orra, a Tragedy\n\nWhile these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions,\nthe armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives\nalong towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison\nthem. But darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but\nimperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to make several\nlong halts, and once or twice to return on their road to resume the\ndirection which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon\nthem ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right\npath. But confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved\nrapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between\nthe two leaders of the banditti.\n\n“It is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,” said the Templar to\nDe Bracy, “in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou art\nnext, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.”\n\n“I have thought better of it,” said De Bracy; “I will not leave thee\ntill the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Boeuf's castle. There\nwill I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that\nshe will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which I\nhave been guilty.”\n\n“And what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?” replied the Knight\nTemplar.\n\n“That concerns thee nothing,” answered his companion.\n\n“I would hope, however, Sir Knight,” said the Templar, “that this\nalteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable\nmeaning, such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?”\n\n“My thoughts are my own,” answered De Bracy; “the fiend laughs, they\nsay, when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to spit fire\nand brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from following\nhis bent.”\n\n“Or the leader of a Free Company,” answered the Templar, “from dreading\nat the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all\nmankind.”\n\n“This is unprofitable and perilous recrimination,” answered De Bracy;\n“suffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I will\nnot give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I\nhave run such risks.”\n\n“Psha,” replied the Templar, “what hast thou to fear?--Thou knowest the\nvows of our order.”\n\n“Right well,” said De Bracy, “and also how they are kept. Come,\nSir Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in\nPalestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your\nconscience.”\n\n“Hear the truth, then,” said the Templar; “I care not for your blue-eyed\nbeauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better mate.”\n\n“What! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?” said De Bracy.\n\n“No, Sir Knight,” said the Templar, haughtily. “To the waiting-woman\nwill I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine\nown.”\n\n“By the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!” said De Bracy.\n\n“And if I do,” said Bois-Guilbert, “who shall gainsay me?”\n\n“No one that I know,” said De Bracy, “unless it be your vow of celibacy,\nor a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.”\n\n“For my vow,” said the Templar, “our Grand Master hath granted me a\ndispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred\nSaracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl\nat her first confession upon Good Friday eve.”\n\n“Thou knowest best thine own privileges,” said De Bracy. “Yet, I would\nhave sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer's money bags,\nthan on the black eyes of the daughter.”\n\n“I can admire both,” answered the Templar; “besides, the old Jew is but\nhalf-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Boeuf, who will not\nlend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I\ncan term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on\nthe lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift,\nthou wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not?--Thou hast\nnothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.”\n\n“No,” replied De Bracy, “I will remain beside my prize. What thou\nsayst is passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by\nthe dispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the\nslaughter of three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a free\npardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.”\n\nWhile this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out\nof those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. “You\nshould be Englishmen,” said he; “and yet, sacred Heaven! you prey\nupon your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my\nneighbours, and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours\nhave reason to be otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye\nwho have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for I\nhave pitied their miseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic\nnobles. What, then, would you have of me? or in what can this violence\nserve ye?--Ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you\nimitate them in their very dumbness?”\n\nIt was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too\nmany good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either\nby his wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along,\ntravelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge\ntrees, arose Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf. It was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a\ndonjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of\ninferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard. Around the\nexterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring\nrivulet. Front-de-Boeuf, whose character placed him often at feud with\nhis enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his\ncastle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at\nevery angle. The access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through\nan arched barbican, or outwork, which was terminated and defended by a\nsmall turret at each corner.\n\nCedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Boeuf's castle raise their\ngrey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the\nwood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly\nconcerning the cause of his misfortune.\n\n“I did injustice,” he said, “to the thieves and outlaws of these woods,\nwhen I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as\njustly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening\nwolves of France. Tell me, dogs--is it my life or my wealth that your\nmaster aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble\nAthelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony\nof our race?--Put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking\nour lives, as you began with our liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot\nrescue England, he is willing to die for her. Tell your tyrannical\nmaster, I do only beseech him to dismiss the Lady Rowena in honour and\nsafety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die\nall who dare fight in her cause.”\n\nThe attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and\nthey now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn\nthree times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall\nupon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit\nthem. The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were\nconducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of\nwhich none but Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had\nthe descendant of the Confessor much time to do justice to the good\ncheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to\nunderstand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from\nRowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a\nlarge room, which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those\nrefectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most\nancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.\n\nThe Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with\ncourtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to\na distant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on\nRebecca, in spite of her father's entreaties, who offered even money,\nin this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with\nhim. “Base unbeliever,” answered one of his guards, “when thou hast seen\nthy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.” And, without\nfarther discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off in a different\ndirection from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully\nsearched and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle;\nand Rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the\nattendance of her handmaiden Elgitha.\n\nThe apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them\nwe turn our first attention, although at present used as a sort of\nguard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now\nabandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other\nadditions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial\nresidence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was\nsupported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that\nhigher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced into\narchitecture.\n\nCedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the\npast and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served,\ninstead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing\nsave the inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel\neven this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by\nCedric's animated and impassioned appeal to him.\n\n“Yes,” said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing\nhimself to Athelstane, “it was in this very hall that my father feasted\nwith Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate\nHarold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had united themselves\nto the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the\nmagnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. Oft have\nI heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was\nadmitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of\nnoble Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around their\nmonarch.”\n\n“I hope,” said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend's\ndiscourse, “they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at\nnoon--we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and\nI never have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after\ndismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.”\n\nCedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional\nobservation of his friend.\n\n“The envoy of Tosti,” he said, “moved up the hall, undismayed by the\nfrowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance\nbefore the throne of King Harold.\n\n“'What terms,' he said, 'Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if\nhe should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?'\n\n“'A brother's love,' cried the generous Harold, 'and the fair earldom of\nNorthumberland.'\n\n“'But should Tosti accept these terms,' continued the envoy, 'what lands\nshall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of Norway?'\n\n“'Seven feet of English ground,' answered Harold, fiercely, 'or, as\nHardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches\nmore.'\n\n“The hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to\nthe Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English\nterritory.”\n\n“I could have pledged him with all my soul,” said Athelstane, “for my\ntongue cleaves to my palate.”\n\n“The baffled envoy,” continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his tale,\nthough it interested not the listener, “retreated, to carry to Tosti and\nhis ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that\nthe distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the Derwent,\n[26] beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying the most\nundaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell, with ten\nthousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought that upon\nthe proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the\nSaxon banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and impelling\nthem to the fatal shores of Sussex?--Who would have thought that Harold,\nwithin a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom,\nthan the share which he allotted in his wrath to the Norwegian\ninvader?--Who would have thought that you, noble Athelstane--that you,\ndescended of Harold's blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst\ndefender of the Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in\nthe very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival?”\n\n“It is sad enough,” replied Athelstane; “but I trust they will hold us\nto a moderate ransom--At any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve\nus outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations\nfor serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by\nthe sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.”\n\n“It may be so,” answered Cedric; “but I cannot look on that stained\nlattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern\nthe passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my\nnoble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or\nof staining it--The pride of Wolfganger's father brought an artist from\nNormandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that\nbreaks the golden light of God's blessed day into so many fantastic\nhues. The foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient,\nready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. He\nreturned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the\nwealth and the simplicity of the Saxon nobles--a folly, oh, Athelstane,\nforeboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of Hengist\nand his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. We\nmade these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants;\nwe borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest\nsimplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported\nthemselves, and we became enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell\nunder Norman arms. Far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and\nliberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of which hath delivered\nus as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!”\n\n“I should,” replied Athelstane, “hold very humble diet a luxury at\npresent; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so truly\nin mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very\nhour of dinner.”\n\n“It is time lost,” muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, “to speak\nto him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of\nHardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save\nto fill, to swill, and to call for more.--Alas!” said he, looking at\nAthelstane with compassion, “that so dull a spirit should be lodged in\nso goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of\nEngland should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed,\nher nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which\nis torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane,\nand I myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have\nbeen made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might\nbring to the usurped power of his nation?”\n\nWhile the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of\ntheir prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod\nof office. This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave\npace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered\nwith dishes, the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant\ncompensation to Athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone.\nThe persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.\n\n“What mummery is this?” said Cedric; “think you that we are ignorant\nwhose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master?\nTell him,” he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open\na negotiation for his freedom,--“Tell your master, Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf, that we know no reason he can have for withholding our\nliberty, excepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense.\nTell him that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we\nshould do to that of a literal robber. Let him name the ransom at which\nhe rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is\nsuited to our means.” The sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.\n\n“And tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,” said Athelstane, “that I send\nhim my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or\nhorseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;\nwhich, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,\nventure to refuse or to delay.”\n\n“I shall deliver to the knight your defiance,” answered the sewer;\n“meanwhile I leave you to your food.”\n\nThe challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a\nlarge mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added\nto a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold\ndefiance it contained. Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric\nas an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose\nprevious indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for\nAthelstane's descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially\nshook hands with him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat\ngrieved when Athelstane observed, “that he would fight a dozen such men\nas Front-de-Boeuf, if, by so doing, he could hasten his departure from\na dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage.”\n Notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of\nsensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon\nshowed, that if the distresses of his country could banish the\nrecollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were\nthe victuals put there, than he proved that the appetite of his Saxon\nancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.\n\nThe captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their\nattention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the\nblast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times,\nwith as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle\nby the destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and\nbattlement, were to roll off like a morning vapour. The Saxons started\nfrom the table, and hastened to the window. But their curiosity was\ndisappointed; for these outlets only looked upon the court of the\ncastle, and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The summons,\nhowever, seemed of importance, for a considerable degree of bustle\ninstantly took place in the castle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n     My daughter--O my ducats--O my daughter!\n     ------O my Christian ducats!\n     Justice--the Law--my ducats, and my daughter!\n     --Merchant of Venice\n\nLeaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their\nungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their\nhalf-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe\nimprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily thrust into\na dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath\nthe level of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat\nitself. The only light was received through one or two loop-holes far\nabove the reach of the captive's hand. These apertures admitted, even\nat mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter\ndarkness long before the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of\nday. Chains and shackles, which had been the portion of former captives,\nfrom whom active exertions to escape had been apprehended, hung rusted\nand empty on the walls of the prison, and in the rings of one of those\nsets of fetters there remained two mouldering bones, which seemed to\nhave been once those of the human leg, as if some prisoner had been left\nnot only to perish there, but to be consumed to a skeleton.\n\nAt one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the\ntop of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured\nwith rust.\n\nThe whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart\nthan that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the\nimminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by\nterrors, of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent. The lovers\nof the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of\nthe greyhounds, than when she is struggling in their fangs. [27]\n\nAnd thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their\nfear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for\nevery effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no\naggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it that surprise\nwhich is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the first\ntime that Isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous. He had\ntherefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might again,\nas formerly, be delivered as a prey from the fowler. Above all, he had\nupon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that unbending\nresolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known to submit\nto the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon them,\nrather than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands.\n\nIn this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected\nbeneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a\ncorner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and\nbeard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light,\nwould have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter\nexisted at the period. The Jew remained, without altering his position,\nfor nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the\ndungeon stair. The bolts screamed as they were withdrawn--the hinges\ncreaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, followed by\nthe two Saracen slaves of the Templar, entered the prison.\n\nFront-de-Boeuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in\npublic war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no\nmeans of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his\ncharacter, and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant\npassions of the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed,\nwould, on features of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and\nveneration due to the marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar\ncase of Front-de-Boeuf, they only added to the ferocity of his\ncountenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This\nformidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet, fitted close to his\nbody, which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He\nhad no weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt, which served to\ncounterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his\nright side.\n\nThe black slaves who attended Front-de-Boeuf were stripped of their\ngorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen,\ntheir sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers\nwhen about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had\nin his hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they\nstopt at the door until Front-de-Boeuf himself carefully locked and\ndouble-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up\nthe apartment towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye fixed, as if\nhe wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to\nfascinate their prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant\neye of Front-de-Boeuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over\nhis unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his\neyes fixed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his\nframe seemed literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while\nencountering the fierce Norman's fixed and baleful gaze. The unhappy\nIsaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance\nwhich his terror dictated, but he could not even doff his cap, or utter\nany word of supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction\nthat tortures and death were impending over him.\n\nOn the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate\nin magnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when\nabout to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps\nof the corner in which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled\nhimself up into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of\nthe slaves to approach. The black satellite came forward accordingly,\nand, producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several\nweights, he laid them at the feet of Front-de-Boeuf, and again retired\nto the respectful distance, at which his companion had already taken his\nstation.\n\nThe motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over\ntheir souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty. Front-de-Boeuf\nhimself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.\n\n“Most accursed dog of an accursed race,” he said, awaking with his deep\nand sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, “seest thou\nthese scales?”\n\nThe unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.\n\n“In these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,” said the relentless\nBaron, “a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of\nthe Tower of London.”\n\n“Holy Abraham!” returned the Jew, finding voice through the very\nextremity of his danger, “heard man ever such a demand?--Who ever\nheard, even in a minstrel's tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds\nof silver?--What human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such\na mass of treasure?--Not within the walls of York, ransack my house\nand that of all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of\nsilver that thou speakest of.”\n\n“I am reasonable,” answered Front-de-Boeuf, “and if silver be scant, I\nrefuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of\nsilver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as\nthy heart has never even conceived.”\n\n“Have mercy on me, noble knight!” exclaimed Isaac; “I am old, and poor,\nand helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me--It is a poor deed to\ncrush a worm.”\n\n“Old thou mayst be,” replied the knight; “more shame to their folly who\nhave suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery--Feeble thou mayst\nbe, for when had a Jew either heart or hand--But rich it is well known\nthou art.”\n\n“I swear to you, noble knight,” said the Jew “by all which I believe,\nand by all which we believe in common---”\n\n“Perjure not thyself,” said the Norman, interrupting him, “and let not\nthine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered\nthe fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy\nterror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy\ntribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the\ngospel which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to\nbind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This\ndungeon is no place for trifling. Prisoners ten thousand times more\ndistinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate\nhath never been known! But for thee is reserved a long and lingering\ndeath, to which theirs were luxury.”\n\nHe again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them\napart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where\nperhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from\ntheir baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask\nof oil. While the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the other\ndisposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already\nmentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow.\n\n“Seest thou, Isaac,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “the range of iron bars above\nthe glowing charcoal?-- [28] on that warm couch thou shalt lie, stripped\nof thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One of these\nslaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other shall\nanoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.--Now,\nchoose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds\nof silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option.”\n\n“It is impossible,” exclaimed the miserable Jew--“it is impossible that\nyour purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a heart\ncapable of exercising such cruelty!”\n\n“Trust not to that, Isaac,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “it were a fatal error.\nDost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands\nof my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire,\nwill blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single\nwretched Jew?--or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have\nneither law, country, nor conscience, but their master's will--who use\nthe poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest\nwink--thinkest thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even\nunderstand the language in which it is asked?--Be wise, old man;\ndischarge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the\nhands of a Christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou\nhast practised on those of his religion. Thy cunning may soon swell\nout once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor medicine can\nrestore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once stretched on these\nbars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that at such rate thou\ncanst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of which few have returned\nto tell. I waste no more words with thee--choose between thy dross and\nthy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be.”\n\n“So may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me,”\n said Isaac, “I cannot make the choice, because I have not the means of\nsatisfying your exorbitant demand!”\n\n“Seize him and strip him, slaves,” said the knight, “and let the fathers\nof his race assist him if they can.”\n\nThe assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron's eye and\nhis hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the\nunfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him\nbetween them, waited the hard-hearted Baron's farther signal. The\nunhappy Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-Boeuf, in\nhope of discovering some symptoms of relenting; but that of the Baron\nexhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had\nbeen the prelude to his cruelty; and the savage eyes of the Saracens,\nrolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister\nexpression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil,\nevinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the\napproaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents.\nThe Jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently\nto be stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentor's relenting, his\nresolution gave way.\n\n“I will pay,” he said, “the thousand pounds of silver--That is,” he\nadded, after a moment's pause, “I will pay it with the help of my\nbrethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere\nI make up so unheard-of a sum.--When and where must it be delivered?”\n\n“Here,” replied Front-de-Boeuf, “here it must be delivered--weighed it\nmust be--weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor.--Thinkest\nthou I will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?”\n\n“And what is to be my surety,” said the Jew, “that I shall be at liberty\nafter this ransom is paid?”\n\n“The word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,” answered\nFront-de-Boeuf; “the faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold\nand silver of thee and all thy tribe.”\n\n“I crave pardon, noble lord,” said Isaac timidly, “but wherefore should\nI rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine?”\n\n“Because thou canst not help it, Jew,” said the knight, sternly. “Wert\nthou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan of\nthy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the\npledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at\nadvantage, nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant\nthee liberty.”\n\nThe Jew groaned deeply.--“Grant me,” he said, “at least with my own\nliberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me as\na Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me\nby the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they may\ncontribute in some sort to my ransom.”\n\n“If thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “their\nransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own concerns,\nJew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.”\n\n“I am, then,” said Isaac, “only to be set at liberty, together with mine\nwounded friend?”\n\n“Shall I twice recommend it,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “to a son of Israel,\nto meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone?--Since\nthou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy\nransom, and that at a short day.”\n\n“Yet hear me,” said the Jew--“for the sake of that very wealth which\nthou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy---” Here he stopt short,\nafraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Boeuf only laughed,\nand himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.\n\n“At the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it\nout--I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser,\neven when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when\nthou didst invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling thee\na usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.”\n\n“I swear by the Talmud,” said the Jew, “that your valour has been\nmisled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own\nchamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment\nwas due at the Passover.”\n\n“I care not what he did,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “the question is, when\nshall I have mine own?--when shall I have the shekels, Isaac?”\n\n“Let my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,” answered Isaac, “with your\nsafe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the\ntreasure---” Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a few\nseconds,--“The treasure shall be told down on this very floor.”\n\n“Thy daughter!” said Front-de-Boeuf, as if surprised,--“By heavens,\nIsaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed\ngirl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of\nthe days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.”\n\nThe yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the\nvery vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they let\ngo their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw\nhimself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-Boeuf.\n\n“Take all that you have asked,” said he, “Sir Knight--take ten times\nmore--reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt,--nay, pierce\nme with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter,\ndeliver her in safety and honour!--As thou art born of woman, spare the\nhonour of a helpless maiden--She is the image of my deceased Rachel,\nshe is the last of six pledges of her love--Will you deprive a widowed\nhusband of his sole remaining comfort?--Will you reduce a father to wish\nthat his only living child were laid beside her dead mother, in the tomb\nof our fathers?”\n\n“I would,” said the Norman, somewhat relenting, “that I had known\nof this before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their\nmoneybags.”\n\n“Think not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,” said Isaac, eager to\nimprove the moment of apparent sympathy; “the hunted fox, the tortured\nwildcat loves its young--the despised and persecuted race of Abraham\nlove their children!”\n\n“Be it so,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “I will believe it in future, Isaac,\nfor thy very sake--but it aids us not now, I cannot help what has\nhappened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in arms,\nnor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides, why\nshouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became\nBois-Guilbert's booty?”\n\n“There will, there must!” exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony;\n“when did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to\nwomen!”\n\n“Dog of an infidel,” said Front-de-Boeuf, with sparkling eyes, and not\nsorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion,\n“blaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought\ninstead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy\nJewish throat!”\n\n“Robber and villain!” said the Jew, retorting the insults of his\noppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it\nimpossible to bridle, “I will pay thee nothing--not one silver penny\nwill I pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and\nhonour!”\n\n“Art thou in thy senses, Israelite?” said the Norman, sternly--“has thy\nflesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil?”\n\n“I care not!” said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection;\n“do thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a\nthousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver\nwill I give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious\nthroat--no, not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to\nsave thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my\nlife if thou wilt, and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to\ndisappoint the Christian.”\n\n“We shall see that,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “for by the blessed rood,\nwhich is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the\nextremities of fire and steel!--Strip him, slaves, and chain him down\nupon the bars.”\n\nIn spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had\nalready torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to\ndisrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle,\npenetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately\nafter loud voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.\nUnwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage\nBaron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaac's garment, and, quitting\nthe dungeon with his attendants, he left the Jew to thank God for\nhis own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter's captivity,\nand probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove\nstrongest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n     Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words\n     Can no way change you to a milder form,\n     I'll woo you, like a soldier, at arms' end,\n     And love you 'gainst the nature of love, force you.\n     --Two Gentlemen of Verona\n\nThe apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted\nup with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being\nplaced there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not\noffered to the other prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-Boeuf, for whom\nit had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect\nhad impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it.\nThe tapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others\nwas tarnished and faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and\ndecayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of\nthe castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation\nof the Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her fate,\nuntil the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts\nwhich each of them was to perform. This had been settled in a council\nheld by Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after\na long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each\ninsisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious\nenterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy\nprisoners.\n\nIt was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose\nadvantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute\nhis views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.\n\nThe interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his\nconfederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person\nwith all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were\nnow flung aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint\ntresses down his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his\ndoublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured\nit, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered\nand embossed with gold work. We have already noticed the extravagant\nfashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of Maurice de\nBracy's might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the gayest,\nbeing turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was the dress\nof a gallant of the period; and, in the present instance, that effect\nwas aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose\nmanners partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a\nsoldier.\n\nHe saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden\nbroach, representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With\nthis, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained\nher standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned\nto conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the\nproffered compliment, and replied, “If I be in the presence of\nmy jailor, Sir Knight--nor will circumstances allow me to think\notherwise--it best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she\nlearns her doom.”\n\n“Alas! fair Rowena,” returned De Bracy, “you are in presence of your\ncaptive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy\nmust receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.”\n\n“I know you not, sir,” said the lady, drawing herself up with all the\npride of offended rank and beauty; “I know you not--and the insolent\nfamiliarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms\nno apology for the violence of a robber.”\n\n“To thyself, fair maid,” answered De Bracy, in his former tone--“to\nthine own charms be ascribed whate'er I have done which passed the\nrespect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar\nof my eyes.”\n\n“I repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man\nwearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence\nof an unprotected lady.”\n\n“That I am unknown to you,” said De Bracy, “is indeed my misfortune;\nyet let me hope that De Bracy's name has not been always unspoken, when\nminstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the\nlists or in the battle-field.”\n\n“To heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,”\n replied Rowena, “more suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and\ntell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the\nmemorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man,\nfollowed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden,\ntransported against her will to the castle of a robber?”\n\n“You are unjust, Lady Rowena,” said the knight, biting his lips in\nsome confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of\naffected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; “yourself free from\npassion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although\ncaused by your own beauty.”\n\n“I pray you, Sir Knight,” said Rowena, “to cease a language so commonly\nused by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or\nnobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such\ncommonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might\nlast from hence to Christmas.”\n\n“Proud damsel,” said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style\nprocured him nothing but contempt--“proud damsel, thou shalt be as\nproudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to\nyour hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for\nthy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in\ncourtly language.”\n\n“Courtesy of tongue,” said Rowena, “when it is used to veil churlishness\nof deed, is but a knight's girdle around the breast of a base clown. I\nwonder not that the restraint appears to gall you--more it were for your\nhonour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than\nto veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and\ndemeanour.”\n\n“You counsel well, lady,” said the Norman; “and in the bold language\nwhich best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave\nthis castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy's wife. I am\nnot wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble\nscrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he\ndistinguishes by the offer of his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and thou\nart the fitter to be my wife. By what other means couldst thou be raised\nto high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance? How else\nwouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where\nSaxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy seat,\nhonoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England that is\ndistinguished by beauty, or dignified by power?”\n\n“Sir Knight,” replied Rowena, “the grange which you contemn hath been\nmy shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it--should that\nday ever arrive--it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the\ndwelling and manners in which I have been brought up.”\n\n“I guess your meaning, lady,” said De Bracy, “though you may think it\nlies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard Coeur\nde Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\nhis minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed\nas the bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he\ntouched this string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion\nso childish and so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power,\nand that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within\nthe castle to Front-de-Boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than\nmine.”\n\n“Wilfred here?” said Rowena, in disdain; “that is as true as that\nFront-de-Boeuf is his rival.”\n\nDe Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.\n\n“Wert thou really ignorant of this?” said he; “didst thou not know\nthat Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?--a meet\nconveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy\nSepulchre!” And he laughed scornfully.\n\n“And if he is here,” said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of\nindifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she\ncould not suppress, “in what is he the rival of Front-de-Boeuf? or what\nhas he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom,\naccording to the use of chivalry?”\n\n“Rowena,” said De Bracy, “art thou, too, deceived by the common error of\nthy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own\ncharms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth,\nas well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-Boeuf, will push\nfrom his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe,\nas readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him\nby some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded\nchampion shall have nothing to fear from Front-de-Boeuf, whom else thou\nmayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion.”\n\n“Save him, for the love of Heaven!” said Rowena, her firmness giving way\nunder terror for her lover's impending fate.\n\n“I can--I will--it is my purpose,” said De Bracy; “for, when Rowena\nconsents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare to put forth\na violent hand upon her kinsman--the son of her guardian--the companion\nof her youth? But it is thy love must buy his protection. I am not\nromantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one\nwho is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. Use\nthine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,--refuse to employ\nit, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom.”\n\n“Thy language,” answered Rowena, “hath in its indifferent bluntness\nsomething which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to\nexpress. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so\ngreat.”\n\n“Flatter thyself, then, with that belief,” said De Bracy, “until\ntime shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle--thy\npreferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Boeuf and that which\nFront-de-Boeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will\nit cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to\nsilence his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Boeuf afraid to\njustify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong\ndraught--let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck\nthe pillow from his head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped\nwithout the effusion of blood. Cedric also--”\n\n“And Cedric also,” said Rowena, repeating his words; “my noble--my\ngenerous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for\nforgetting his fate even in that of his son!”\n\n“Cedric's fate also depends upon thy determination,” said De Bracy; “and\nI leave thee to form it.”\n\nHitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with\nundismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the\ndanger as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which\nphysiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild, timid,\nand gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the\ncircumstances of her education. Accustomed to see the will of all, even\nof Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with others,) give way before\nher wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and self-confidence\nwhich arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in\nwhich we move. She could scarce conceive the possibility of her will\nbeing opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard.\n\nHer haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious\ncharacter, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted\nher when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well\nas that of her lover and her guardian; and when she found her will, the\nslightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention,\nnow placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong, fierce, and\ndetermined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved\nto use it, she quailed before him.\n\nAfter casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was\nnowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised\nher hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation\nand sorrow. It was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such\nextremity without feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though\nhe was yet more embarrassed than touched. He had, in truth, gone too\nfar to recede; and yet, in Rowena's present condition, she could not be\nacted on either by argument or threats. He paced the apartment to and\nfro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now\nhesitating concerning his own line of conduct.\n\nIf, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this\ndisconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair hopes\nfor which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince\nJohn and his jovial comrades? “And yet,” he said to himself, “I feel\nmyself ill framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so\nfair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they\nare drowned in tears. I would she had retained her original haughtiness\nof disposition, or that I had a larger share of Front-de-Boeuf's\nthrice-tempered hardness of heart!”\n\nAgitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be\ncomforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the\nexcess of despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of\nconsolation De Bracy was interrupted by the horn, “hoarse-winded blowing\nfar and keen,” which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates\nof the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and\nof license. Of them all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the\ninterruption; for his conference with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a\npoint, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his\nenterprise.\n\nAnd here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof\nthan the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy\nrepresentation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. It\nis grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against\nthe crown the liberties of England were indebted for their existence,\nshould themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of\nexcesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to those of\nnature and humanity. But, alas! we have only to extract from the\nindustrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected\nfrom contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly\nreach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.\n\nThe description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the\ncruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and\nlords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the\nexcesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed.\n“They grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when\nthey were built, they filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who\nseized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them\ninto prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever\nendured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet,\nor the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. They squeezed the\nheads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while\nthey threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and\ntoads.” But it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing\nthe remainder of this description. [29]\n\nAs another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the\nstrongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess Matilda,\nthough a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of\nEngland, niece to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of Germany,\nthe daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during\nher early residence for education in England, to assume the veil of a\nnun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman\nnobles. This excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of\nEngland, as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit.\nThe assembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the\nnotoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded; giving thus\nan indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that\ndisgraceful license by which that age was stained. It was a matter of\npublic knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of King William,\nhis Norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no\nlaw but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered\nSaxons of their lands and their goods, but invaded the honour of their\nwives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license; and hence\nit was then common for matrons and maidens of noble families to assume\nthe veil, and take shelter in convents, not as called thither by the\nvocation of God, but solely to preserve their honour from the unbridled\nwickedness of man.\n\nSuch and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public\ndeclaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need add\nnothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have\ndetailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of\nthe Wardour MS.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n     I'll woo her as the lion woos his bride.\n     --Douglas\n\nWhile the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the\ncastle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered\nturret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and\non being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence\nof an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to\nbeat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon\nthe floor. The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered, and scowled at\nthe fair Jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness,\nwhen united with evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty.\n\n“Thou must up and away, old house-cricket,” said one of the men; “our\nnoble master commands it--Thou must e'en leave this chamber to a fairer\nguest.”\n\n“Ay,” grumbled the hag, “even thus is service requited. I have known\nwhen my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of\nsaddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of\nevery groom such as thou.”\n\n“Good Dame Urfried,” said the other man, “stand not to reason on it,\nbut up and away. Lords' hests must be listened to with a quick ear. Thou\nhast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art now\nthe very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren heath--thou\nhast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of\nthem--Come, amble off with thee.”\n\n“Ill omens dog ye both!” said the old woman; “and a kennel be your\nburying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if I\nleave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!”\n\n“Answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,” said the man, and\nretired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose\npresence she had been thus unwillingly forced.\n\n“What devil's deed have they now in the wind?” said the old hag,\nmurmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and\nmalignant glance at Rebecca; “but it is easy to guess--Bright eyes,\nblack locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his\nblack unguent--Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone\nturret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of\nfive hundred fathoms beneath the earth.--Thou wilt have owls for thy\nneighbours, fair one; and their screams will be heard as far, and as\nmuch regarded, as thine own. Outlandish, too,” she said, marking the\ndress and turban of Rebecca--“What country art thou of?--a Saracen?\nor an Egyptian?--Why dost not answer?--thou canst weep, canst thou not\nspeak?”\n\n“Be not angry, good mother,” said Rebecca.\n\n“Thou needst say no more,” replied Urfried “men know a fox by the train,\nand a Jewess by her tongue.”\n\n“For the sake of mercy,” said Rebecca, “tell me what I am to expect as\nthe conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it\nmy life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down\ncheerfully.”\n\n“Thy life, minion?” answered the sibyl; “what would taking thy life\npleasure them?--Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage shalt thou\nhave as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And shall\na Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at me--I\nwas as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Boeuf, father of\nthis Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and his\nseven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber\nto chamber--There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not\nslippery with their blood. They died--they died every man; and ere their\nbodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become the prey\nand the scorn of the conqueror!”\n\n“Is there no help?--Are there no means of escape?” said\nRebecca--“Richly, richly would I requite thine aid.”\n\n“Think not of it,” said the hag; “from hence there is no escape but\nthrough the gates of death; and it is late, late,” she added, shaking\nher grey head, “ere these open to us--Yet it is comfort to think that we\nleave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. Fare\nthee well, Jewess!--Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for thou\nhast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare thee well,\nI say. My thread is spun out--thy task is yet to begin.”\n\n“Stay! stay! for Heaven's sake!” said Rebecca; “stay, though it be to\ncurse and to revile me--thy presence is yet some protection.”\n\n“The presence of the mother of God were no protection,” answered the old\nwoman. “There she stands,” pointing to a rude image of the Virgin Mary,\n“see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.”\n\nShe left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of\nsneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their\nhabitual frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear\nher curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty\nshe descended the turret-stair.\n\nRebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena;\nfor what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be\nused towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might\nbe preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage,\nthat she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural\nstrength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. Of\na strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp\nand wealth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she\nwitnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not been able to\nblind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed.\nLike Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld,\namid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads\nof her people by a single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought\ndown to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other\ncircumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.\n\nFrom her father's example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear\nherself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not indeed\nimitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the\nmeanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by\nwhich it was dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as\nif submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as\nthe daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the\nconsciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her\nmerit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her\nto aspire to.\n\nThus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the\nfirmness necessary for acting under them. Her present situation required\nall her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.\n\nHer first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes\neither of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor\ntrap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the\nmain building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of\nthe turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single window opened\nupon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca,\nat first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no\ncommunication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated\nbartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures,\nat which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and\nflanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.\n\nThere was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong\nreliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters. Rebecca,\nhowever erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to\nthe chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be\ntheir hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of Zion would be\none day called in with the fulness of the Gentiles. In the meanwhile,\nall around her showed that their present state was that of punishment\nand probation, and that it was their especial duty to suffer without\nsinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune,\nRebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to\nmeet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.\n\nThe prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was\nheard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened,\nand a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed\ntheir misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap,\npulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he\nheld his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest. In this guise,\nas if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of which\nhe was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner; yet,\nruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what\npurpose had brought him thither, so that Rebecca, making an effort\nupon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already\nunclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to\nproffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his\navarice was to bespeak his favour.\n\n“Take these,” she said, “good friend, and for God's sake be merciful\nto me and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet are they\ntrifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this\ncastle, free and uninjured.”\n\n“Fair flower of Palestine,” replied the outlaw, “these pearls are\norient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are\nbrilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken\nup this wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.”\n\n“Do not do yourself such wrong,” said Rebecca; “take ransom, and have\nmercy!--Gold will purchase you pleasure,--to misuse us, could only bring\nthee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and\nif thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy\nrestoration to civil society--mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and\nbe placed beyond the necessity of committing more.”\n\n“It is well spoken,” replied the outlaw in French, finding it difficult\nprobably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had opened\nin that language; “but know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy\nfather is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to\nconvert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The\nvenerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from\nhim all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy\nentreaty. The ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other\ncoin will I accept it.”\n\n“Thou art no outlaw,” said Rebecca, in the same language in which he\naddressed her; “no outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this\nland uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but\na Norman--a Norman, noble perhaps in birth--O, be so in thy actions, and\ncast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!”\n\n“And thou, who canst guess so truly,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\ndropping the mantle from his face, “art no true daughter of Israel,\nbut in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an\noutlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt\nto hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become\nthem, than to deprive thee of these ornaments.”\n\n“What wouldst thou have of me,” said Rebecca, “if not my wealth?--We\ncan have nought in common between us--you are a Christian--I am a\nJewess.--Our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and\nthe synagogue.”\n\n“It were so, indeed,” replied the Templar, laughing; “wed with a Jewess?\n'Despardieux!'--Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! And know, besides,\nsweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to offer me\nhis most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I could not\nwed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than 'par\namours', as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the cross of my\nHoly Order.”\n\n“Darest thou appeal to it,” said Rebecca, “on an occasion like the\npresent?”\n\n“And if I do so,” said the Templar, “it concerns not thee, who art no\nbeliever in the blessed sign of our salvation.”\n\n“I believe as my fathers taught,” said Rebecca; “and may God forgive my\nbelief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you appeal\nwithout scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are\nabout to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a\nman of religion?”\n\n“It is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!” answered the\nTemplar; “but, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices make\nthee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on\nthe part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall\nspeedily be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the\nwisest of monarchs, not his father, whose examples you must needs allow\nare weighty, claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the\nTemple of Zion have won by our zeal in its defence. The protectors of\nSolomon's Temple may claim license by the example of Solomon.”\n\n“If thou readest the Scripture,” said the Jewess, “and the lives of the\nsaints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime\nis like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and\nnecessary herbs.”\n\nThe eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this reproof--“Hearken,” he\nsaid, “Rebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my\nlanguage shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow\nand spear--subject to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will I\nabate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou\nrefusest to entreaty or necessity.”\n\n“Stand back,” said Rebecca--“stand back, and hear me ere thou offerest\nto commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed overpower for\nGod made women weak, and trusted their defence to man's generosity. But\nI will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of Europe to\nthe other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their\ncompassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory--each Chapter of thy Order,\nshall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess. Those\nwho tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for having so\nfar dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of my\npeople.”\n\n“Thou art keen-witted, Jewess,” replied the Templar, well aware of the\ntruth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in\nthe most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as\nhe now prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had\nfollowed upon it--“thou art sharp-witted,” he said; “but loud must be\nthy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this\ncastle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams\nfor help, die alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca.\nSubmit to thy fate--embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in\nsuch state, that many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in\nbeauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the\nTemple.”\n\n“Submit to my fate!” said Rebecca--“and, sacred Heaven! to what\nfate?--embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that\nharbours such a villain?--THOU the best lance of the Templars!--Craven\nknight!--forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.--The God of\nAbraham's promise hath opened an escape to his daughter--even from this\nabyss of infamy!”\n\nAs she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the\nbartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the\nparapet, with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous\ndepth below. Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she had\nhitherto stood perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time\nto intercept nor to stop her. As he offered to advance, she exclaimed,\n“Remain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!--one\nfoot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall\nbe crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that\ncourt-yard, ere it become the victim of thy brutality!”\n\nAs she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards\nheaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final\nplunge. The Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded\nto pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. “Come\ndown,” he said, “rash girl!--I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will\noffer thee no offence.”\n\n“I will not trust thee, Templar,” said Rebecca; “thou hast taught me\nbetter how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next Preceptory\nwould grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned\nnought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish maiden.”\n\n“You do me injustice,” exclaimed the Templar fervently; “I swear to you\nby the name which I bear--by the cross on my bosom--by the sword on my\nside--by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do thee\nno injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy father's sake\nforbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a\npowerful one.”\n\n“Alas!” said Rebecca, “I know it but too well--dare I trust thee?”\n\n“May my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,” said Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, “if thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a law,\nmany a commandment have I broken, but my word never.”\n\n“I will then trust thee,” said Rebecca, “thus far;” and she descended\nfrom the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of\nthe embrasures, or “machicolles”, as they were then called.--“Here,” she\nsaid, “I take my stand. Remain where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt\nto diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that\nthe Jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with God, than her honour\nto the Templar!”\n\nWhile Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded\nso well with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her\nlooks, air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her\nglance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so\ninstant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her\nfate at her command, and could escape at will from infamy to death,\ngave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet\nmore brilliant fire to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud himself and\nhigh-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so\ncommanding.\n\n“Let there be peace between us, Rebecca,” he said.\n\n“Peace, if thou wilt,” answered Rebecca--“Peace--but with this space\nbetween.”\n\n“Thou needst no longer fear me,” said Bois-Guilbert.\n\n“I fear thee not,” replied she; “thanks to him that reared this dizzy\ntower so high, that nought could fall from it and live--thanks to him,\nand to the God of Israel!--I fear thee not.”\n\n“Thou dost me injustice,” said the Templar; “by earth, sea, and sky,\nthou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen me,\nhard, selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and\non woman therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear\nme, Rebecca--Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more\ndevoted to the lady of his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the\ndaughter of a petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous\ntower, and an unproductive vineyard, and some few leagues of the barren\nLandes of Bourdeaux, her name was known wherever deeds of arms were\ndone, known wider than that of many a lady's that had a county for a\ndowery.--Yes,” he continued, pacing up and down the little platform,\nwith an animation in which he seemed to lose all consciousness of\nRebecca's presence--“Yes, my deeds, my danger, my blood, made the name\nof Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of Castile to that of\nByzantium. And how was I requited?--When I returned with my dear-bought\nhonours, purchased by toil and blood, I found her wedded to a Gascon\nsquire, whose name was never heard beyond the limits of his own paltry\ndomain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I revenge me of her\nbroken faith! But my vengeance has recoiled on myself. Since that day\nI have separated myself from life and its ties--My manhood must know no\ndomestic home--must be soothed by no affectionate wife--My age must\nknow no kindly hearth--My grave must be solitary, and no offspring must\noutlive me, to bear the ancient name of Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of\nmy Superior I have laid down the right of self-action--the privilege\nof independence. The Templar, a serf in all but the name, can possess\nneither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, and breathes, but at the will\nand pleasure of another.”\n\n“Alas!” said Rebecca, “what advantages could compensate for such an\nabsolute sacrifice?”\n\n“The power of vengeance, Rebecca,” replied the Templar, “and the\nprospects of ambition.”\n\n“An evil recompense,” said Rebecca, “for the surrender of the rights\nwhich are dearest to humanity.”\n\n“Say not so, maiden,” answered the Templar; “revenge is a feast for the\ngods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves,\nit is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession\nof mere mortals.--And ambition? it is a temptation which could disturb\neven the bliss of heaven itself.”--He paused a moment, and then added,\n“Rebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have a proud and\na powerful soul. Mine thou must be!--Nay, start not,” he added, “it must\nbe with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou must consent to\nshare with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the throne\nof a monarch!--Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you refuse.--The\nTemplar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his power of free\nagency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body, before\nwhich thrones already tremble,--even as the single drop of rain which\nmixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean,\nwhich undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such a swelling flood\nis that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean member, but\nalready one of the Chief Commanders, and may well aspire one day to hold\nthe batoon of Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not\nalone place their foot upon the necks of kings--a hemp-sandall'd monk\ncan do that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne--our gauntlet\nshall wrench the sceptre from their gripe. Not the reign of your\nvainly-expected Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my\nambition may aim at. I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and\nI have found such in thee.”\n\n“Sayest thou this to one of my people?” answered Rebecca. “Bethink\nthee--”\n\n“Answer me not,” said the Templar, “by urging the difference of our\ncreeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in\nderision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our\nfounders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying\nmartyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of\nsavages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert, valuable\nonly in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and\nwider views, and found out a better indemnification for our sacrifices.\nOur immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our high military\nfame, which brings within our circle the flower of chivalry from every\nChristian clime--these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders\nlittle dreamed, and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits\nas embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and whose superstition\nmakes them our passive tools. But I will not further withdraw the veil\nof our mysteries. That bugle-sound announces something which may require\nmy presence. Think on what I have said.--Farewell!--I do not say forgive\nme the violence I have threatened, for it was necessary to the display\nof thy character. Gold can be only known by the application of the\ntouchstone. I will soon return, and hold further conference with thee.”\n\nHe re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving\nRebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which\nshe had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold\nbad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. When she\nentered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to\nthe God of Jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to\nimplore its continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided\ninto her petition--it was that of the wounded Christian, whom fate had\nplaced in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart\nindeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity in prayer,\nshe mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate\nhers could have no alliance--a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But\nthe petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices\nof her sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n  A damn'd cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life!\n  --She Stoops to Conquer\n\nWhen the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy\nalready there. “Your love-suit,” said De Bracy, “hath, I suppose, been\ndisturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come\nlater and more reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has\nproved more agreeable than mine.”\n\n“Has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?”\n said the Templar.\n\n“By the bones of Thomas a Becket,” answered De Bracy, “the Lady Rowena\nmust have heard that I cannot endure the sight of women's tears.”\n\n“Away!” said the Templar; “thou a leader of a Free Company, and regard\na woman's tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the\nflame blaze the brighter.”\n\n“Gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,” replied De Bracy; “but\nthis damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was\nsuch wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of\nSt Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us. [30] A water-fiend hath possessed\nthe fair Saxon.”\n\n“A legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,” replied the\nTemplar; “for, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself, could\nhave inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.--But where is\nFront-de-Boeuf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously.”\n\n“He is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,” replied De Bracy, coolly;\n“probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle.\nThou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his\ntreasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Boeuf is like to offer,\nwill raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and\ntrumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals call him.”\n\nThey were soon after joined by Front-de-Boeuf, who had been disturbed in\nhis tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted,\nand had only tarried to give some necessary directions.\n\n“Let us see the cause of this cursed clamour,” said\nFront-de-Boeuf--“here is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in\nSaxon.”\n\nHe looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some\nhopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper,\nand then handed it to De Bracy.\n\n“It may be magic spells for aught I know,” said De Bracy, who possessed\nhis full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of\nthe period. “Our chaplain attempted to teach me to write,” he said, “but\nall my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and so the\nold shaveling gave up the task.”\n\n“Give it me,” said the Templar. “We have that of the priestly character,\nthat we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.”\n\n“Let us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then,” said De Bracy;\n“what says the scroll?”\n\n“It is a formal letter of defiance,” answered the Templar; “but, by\nour Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most\nextraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a\nbaronial castle.”\n\n“Jest!” said Front-de-Boeuf, “I would gladly know who dares jest with me\nin such a matter!--Read it, Sir Brian.”\n\nThe Templar accordingly read it as follows:--“I, Wamba, the son of\nWitless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood,\ncalled the Saxon,--And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd---”\n\n“Thou art mad,” said Front-de-Boeuf, interrupting the reader.\n\n“By St Luke, it is so set down,” answered the Templar. Then resuming his\ntask, he went on,--“I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, swineherd unto the\nsaid Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who\nmake common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight,\ncalled for the present 'Le Noir Faineant', and the stout yeoman, Robert\nLocksley, called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front de-Boeuf, and\nyour allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have,\nwithout cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized\nupon the person of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon\nthe person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of\nHargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man,\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon the persons of certain freeborn\nmen, their 'cnichts'; also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also\nupon a certain Jew, named Isaac of York, together with his daughter, a\nJewess, and certain horses and mules: Which noble persons, with their\n'cnichts' and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess\nbeforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travelling as liege\nsubjects upon the king's highway; therefore we require and demand\nthat the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of Rotherwood, Rowena of\nHargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with their servants,\n'cnichts', and followers, also the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess\naforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining, be,\nwithin an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us, or to those\nwhom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and\nunharmed in body and goods. Failing of which, we do pronounce to you,\nthat we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies\nagainst ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our utmost to\nyour annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may God have you in his\nkeeping.--Signed by us upon the eve of St Withold's day, under the great\ntrysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a\nholy man, Clerk to God, our Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of\nCopmanhurst.”\n\nAt the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a\nrude sketch of a cock's head and comb, with a legend expressing this\nhieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this\nrespectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the\nson of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,\n“Le Noir Faineant”. And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough\ndrawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.\n\nThe knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then\ngazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to\nknow what it could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence by\nan uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with\nmore moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-Boeuf, on the contrary, seemed\nimpatient of their ill-timed jocularity.\n\n“I give you plain warning,” he said, “fair sirs, that you had better\nconsult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way\nto such misplaced merriment.”\n\n“Front-de-Boeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow,”\n said De Bracy to the Templar; “he is cowed at the very idea of a cartel,\nthough it come but from a fool and a swineherd.”\n\n“By St Michael,” answered Front-de-Boeuf, “I would thou couldst stand\nthe whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These fellows dared\nnot have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been\nsupported by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in this\nforest to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who\nwas taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which\ngored him to death in five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me\nas there were launched against yonder target at Ashby.--Here, fellow,”\n he added, to one of his attendants, “hast thou sent out to see by what\nforce this precious challenge is to be supported?”\n\n“There are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,” answered a\nsquire who was in attendance.\n\n“Here is a proper matter!” said Front-de-Boeuf, “this comes of lending\nyou the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly,\nbut you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!”\n\n“Of hornets?” said De Bracy; “of stingless drones rather; a band of lazy\nknaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than labour\nfor their maintenance.”\n\n“Stingless!” replied Front-de-Boeuf; “fork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard\nin length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are\nsting enough.”\n\n“For shame, Sir Knight!” said the Templar. “Let us summon our people,\nand sally forth upon them. One knight--ay, one man-at-arms, were enough\nfor twenty such peasants.”\n\n“Enough, and too much,” said De Bracy; “I should only be ashamed to\ncouch lance against them.”\n\n“True,” answered Front-de-Boeuf; “were they black Turks or Moors, Sir\nTemplar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy; but\nthese are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save\nwhat we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little\nin the glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men\nenough to defend the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all\nyour band, De Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful\nthat were engaged in this mad business.”\n\n“Thou dost not fear,” said the Templar, “that they can assemble in force\nsufficient to attempt the castle?”\n\n“Not so, Sir Brian,” answered Front-de-Boeuf. “These outlaws have indeed\na daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced\nleaders, my castle may defy them.”\n\n“Send to thy neighbours,” said the Templar, “let them assemble their\npeople, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester\nand a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf!”\n\n“You jest, Sir Knight,” answered the baron; “but to whom should I\nsend?--Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, and so\nare my other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal\nenterprise.”\n\n“Then send to York, and recall our people,” said De Bracy. “If they\nabide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free Companions,\nI will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in\ngreen-wood.”\n\n“And who shall bear such a message?” said Front-de-Boeuf; “they will\nbeset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.--I have it,” he\nadded, after pausing for a moment--“Sir Templar, thou canst write\nas well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my\nchaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas\ncarousals--”\n\n“So please ye,” said the squire, who was still in attendance, “I think\nold Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor.\nHe was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her,\nwhich man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.”\n\n“Go, search them out, Engelred,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “and then, Sir\nTemplar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.”\n\n“I would rather do it at the sword's point than at that of the pen,”\n said Bois-Guilbert; “but be it as you will.”\n\nHe sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle\nof the following tenor:--“Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, with his noble\nand knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands\nof slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself the\nBlack Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought\nto know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no\nright to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. Touching\nthe prisoners we have made, we do in Christian charity require you to\nsend a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them\nwith God; since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning\nbefore noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements,\nshall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred\nthemselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require you to send\na priest to reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall render them\nthe last earthly service.”\n\nThis letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to\nthe messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had\nbrought.\n\nThe yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the\nhead-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established\nunder a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the\ncastle. Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and\nLocksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to\ntheir summons. Around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a\nbold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed\nthe ordinary nature of their occupation. More than two hundred had\nalready assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they\nobeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather\nin the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other\nrespects the same.\n\nBesides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting\nof the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as\nmany bondsmen and servants from Cedric's extensive estate, had already\narrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were\narmed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes\nconverts to military purposes. Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the\nlike, were their chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy\nof conquerors, were jealous of permitting to the vanquished Saxons the\npossession or the use of swords and spears. These circumstances rendered\nthe assistance of the Saxons far from being so formidable to the\nbesieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior numbers,\nand the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise well have\nmade them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of\nthe Templar was now delivered.\n\nReference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its\ncontents.\n\n“By the crook of St Dunstan,” said that worthy ecclesiastic, “which hath\nbrought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e'er another\nsaint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this jargon,\nwhich, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess.”\n\nHe then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed\nit to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper\nwith such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume\nupon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to\nLocksley.\n\n“If the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I\nmight know something of the matter,” said the brave yeoman; “but as the\nmatter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that's at\ntwelve miles distance.”\n\n“I must be clerk, then,” said the Black Knight; and taking the letter\nfrom Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the\nmeaning in Saxon to his confederates.\n\n“Execute the noble Cedric!” exclaimed Wamba; “by the rood, thou must be\nmistaken, Sir Knight.”\n\n“Not I, my worthy friend,” replied the knight, “I have explained the\nwords as they are here set down.”\n\n“Then, by St Thomas of Canterbury,” replied Gurth, “we will have the\ncastle, should we tear it down with our hands!”\n\n“We have nothing else to tear it with,” replied Wamba; “but mine are\nscarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.”\n\n“'Tis but a contrivance to gain time,” said Locksley; “they dare not do\na deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty.”\n\n“I would,” said the Black Knight, “there were some one among us who\ncould obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands\nwith the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent,\nthis holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure\nus the information we desire.”\n\n“A plague on thee, and thy advice!” said the pious hermit; “I tell thee,\nSir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar's frock, my priesthood,\nmy sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in my\ngreen jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one Christian.”\n\n“I fear,” said the Black Knight, “I fear greatly, there is no one here\nthat is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character\nof father confessor?”\n\nAll looked on each other, and were silent.\n\n“I see,” said Wamba, after a short pause, “that the fool must be still\nthe fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from.\nYou must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before\nI wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came\nupon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the\nassistance of the good hermit's frock, together with the priesthood,\nsanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall\nbe found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our\nworthy master Cedric, and his companions in adversity.”\n\n“Hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?” said the Black Knight, addressing\nGurth.\n\n“I know not,” said Gurth; “but if he hath not, it will be the first time\nhe hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.”\n\n“On with the frock, then, good fellow,” quoth the Knight, “and let thy\nmaster send us an account of their situation within the castle. Their\nnumbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a\nsudden and bold attack. Time wears--away with thee.”\n\n“And, in the meantime,” said Locksley, “we will beset the place so\nclosely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So\nthat, my good friend,” he continued, addressing Wamba, “thou mayst\nassure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the\npersons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their\nown.”\n\n“Pax vobiscum,” said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious\ndisguise.\n\nAnd so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,\nand departed to execute his mission.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n     The hottest horse will oft be cool,\n     The dullest will show fire;\n     The friar will often play the fool,\n     The fool will play the friar.\n     --Old Song\n\nWhen the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having\nhis knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of\nthe castle of Front-de-Boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and\nerrand.\n\n“Pax vobiscum,” answered the Jester, “I am a poor brother of the Order\nof St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy\nprisoners now secured within this castle.”\n\n“Thou art a bold friar,” said the warder, “to come hither, where, saving\nour own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these\ntwenty years.”\n\n“Yet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,” answered\nthe pretended friar; “trust me it will find good acceptance with him,\nand the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.”\n\n“Gramercy,” said the warder; “but if I come to shame for leaving my\npost upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar's grey gown be proof\nagainst a grey-goose shaft.”\n\nWith this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the\ncastle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the\ngate and demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received\nhis master's commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having\npreviously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed,\nwithout further scruple, the commands which he had received. The\nharebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this\ndangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found\nhimself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as\nReginald Front-de-Boeuf, and he brought out his “pax vobiscum”, to which\nhe, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with\nmore anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. But\nFront-de-Boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his\npresence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him\nany cause of suspicion.\n\n“Who and whence art thou, priest?” said he.\n\n“'Pax vobiscum',” reiterated the Jester, “I am a poor servant of St\nFrancis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among\nthieves, (as Scripture hath it,) 'quidam viator incidit in latrones',\nwhich thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly\noffice on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.”\n\n“Ay, right,” answered Front-de-Boeuf; “and canst thou tell me, holy\nfather, the number of those banditti?”\n\n“Gallant sir,” answered the Jester, “'nomen illis legio', their name is\nlegion.”\n\n“Tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak\nand cord will ill protect thee.”\n\n“Alas!” said the supposed friar, “'cor meum eructavit', that is to\nsay, I was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be--what of\nyeomen--what of commons, at least five hundred men.”\n\n“What!” said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, “muster\nthe wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood.”\n Then taking Front-de-Boeuf aside “Knowest thou the priest?”\n\n“He is a stranger from a distant convent,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “I know\nhim not.”\n\n“Then trust him not with thy purpose in words,” answered the Templar.\n“Let him carry a written order to De Bracy's company of Free Companions,\nto repair instantly to their master's aid. In the meantime, and that the\nshaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of\npreparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.”\n\n“It shall be so,” said Front-de-Boeuf. And he forthwith appointed a\ndomestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane\nwere confined.\n\nThe impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his\nconfinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the\nattitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach\nof a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes\naddressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of\nthe adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the\nliberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting\nhimself about the duration of his captivity, which he concluded, would,\nlike all earthly evils, find an end in Heaven's good time.\n\n“'Pax vobiscum',” said the Jester, entering the apartment; “the blessing\nof St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saints whatsoever, be\nupon ye and about ye.”\n\n“Enter freely,” answered Cedric to the supposed friar; “with what intent\nart thou come hither?”\n\n“To bid you prepare yourselves for death,” answered the Jester.\n\n“It is impossible!” replied Cedric, starting. “Fearless and wicked as\nthey are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!”\n\n“Alas!” said the Jester, “to restrain them by their sense of humanity,\nis the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.\nBethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane,\nwhat crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye\nbe called to answer at a higher tribunal.”\n\n“Hearest thou this, Athelstane?” said Cedric; “we must rouse up our\nhearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men,\nthan live like slaves.”\n\n“I am ready,” answered Athelstane, “to stand the worst of their malice,\nand shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did to my\ndinner.”\n\n“Let us then unto our holy gear, father,” said Cedric.\n\n“Wait yet a moment, good uncle,” said the Jester, in his natural tone;\n“better look long before you leap in the dark.”\n\n“By my faith,” said Cedric, “I should know that voice!”\n\n“It is that of your trusty slave and jester,” answered Wamba, throwing\nback his cowl. “Had you taken a fool's advice formerly, you would not\nhave been here at all. Take a fool's advice now, and you will not be\nhere long.”\n\n“How mean'st thou, knave?” answered the Saxon.\n\n“Even thus,” replied Wamba; “take thou this frock and cord, which are\nall the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving\nme your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.”\n\n“Leave thee in my stead!” said Cedric, astonished at the proposal; “why,\nthey would hang thee, my poor knave.”\n\n“E'en let them do as they are permitted,” said Wamba; “I trust--no\ndisparagement to your birth--that the son of Witless may hang in a chain\nwith as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.”\n\n“Well, Wamba,” answered Cedric, “for one thing will I grant thy request.\nAnd that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with Lord\nAthelstane instead of me.”\n\n“No, by St Dunstan,” answered Wamba; “there were little reason in that.\nGood right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to save\nthe son of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the\nbenefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.”\n\n“Villain,” said Cedric, “the fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of\nEngland!”\n\n“They might be whomsoever they pleased,” replied Wamba; “but my neck\nstands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake.\nWherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me\nto leave this dungeon as free as I entered.”\n\n“Let the old tree wither,” continued Cedric, “so the stately hope of the\nforest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it is\nthe duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide\ntogether the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and\nsafe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.”\n\n“Not so, father Cedric,” said Athelstane, grasping his hand,--for, when\nroused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his\nhigh race--“Not so,” he continued; “I would rather remain in this hall\na week without food save the prisoner's stinted loaf, or drink save\nthe prisoner's measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape\nwhich the slave's untaught kindness has purveyed for his master.”\n\n“You are called wise men, sirs,” said the Jester, “and I a crazed fool;\nbut, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide this\ncontroversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any\nfarther. I am like John-a-Duck's mare, that will let no man mount\nher but John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not\nconsent--basta--I can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be\nchucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I'll hang\nfor no man but my own born master.”\n\n“Go, then, noble Cedric,” said Athelstane, “neglect not this\nopportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our\nrescue--your remaining here would ruin us all.”\n\n“And is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?” said Cedric,\nlooking to the Jester.\n\n“Prospect, indeed!” echoed Wamba; “let me tell you, when you fill my\ncloak, you are wrapped in a general's cassock. Five hundred men are\nthere without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My\nfool's cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see\nwhat good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I\nfear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so\nfarewell, master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let\nmy cockscomb hang in the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung away\nmy life for my master, like a faithful---fool.”\n\nThe last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest\nand earnest. The tears stood in Cedric's eyes.\n\n“Thy memory shall be preserved,” he said, “while fidelity and affection\nhave honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of\nsaving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou\nshouldst not overbear me in this matter.”\n\nThe exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck\nCedric.\n\n“I know no language,” he said, “but my own, and a few words of their\nmincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend brother?”\n\n“The spell lies in two words,” replied Wamba--“'Pax vobiscum' will\nanswer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, 'Pax\nvobiscum' carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a\nbroomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a\ndeep grave tone,--'Pax vobiscum!'--it is irresistible--Watch and ward,\nknight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all.\nI think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to\nbe doubted they may, I will try its weight upon the finisher of the\nsentence.”\n\n“If such prove the case,” said the master, “my religious orders are soon\ntaken--'Pax vobiscum'. I trust I shall remember the pass-word.--Noble\nAthelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make\namends for a weaker head--I will save you, or return and die with you.\nThe royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats\nin my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave\nwho risked himself for his master, if Cedric's peril can prevent\nit.--Farewell.”\n\n“Farewell, noble Cedric,” said Athelstane; “remember it is the true part\nof a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.”\n\n“Farewell, uncle,” added Wamba; “and remember 'Pax vobiscum'.”\n\nThus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not\nlong ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his Jester\nhad recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by\nwhich he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was\ninterrupted by a female form.\n\n“'Pax vobiscum!'” said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to\nhurry past, when a soft voice replied, “'Et vobis--quaso, domine\nreverendissime, pro misericordia vestra'.”\n\n“I am somewhat deaf,” replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same\ntime muttered to himself, “A curse on the fool and his 'Pax vobiscum!' I\nhave lost my javelin at the first cast.”\n\nIt was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf\nof his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew full\nwell.\n\n“I pray you of dear love, reverend father,” she replied in his own\nlanguage, “that you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a\nwounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and\nus as thy holy office teaches--Never shall good deed so highly advantage\nthy convent.”\n\n“Daughter,” answered Cedric, much embarrassed, “my time in this castle\nwill not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office--I must\npresently forth--there is life and death upon my speed.”\n\n“Yet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,”\n replied the suppliant, “not to leave the oppressed and endangered\nwithout counsel or succour.”\n\n“May the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of\nOdin and of Thor!” answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably\nhave proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual\ncharacter, when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of\nUrfried, the old crone of the turret.\n\n“How, minion,” said she to the female speaker, “is this the manner\nin which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy\nprison-cell yonder?--Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious\nlanguage to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?”\n\n“A Jewess!” said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get\nclear of their interruption,--“Let me pass, woman! stop me not at your\nperil. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution.”\n\n“Come this way, father,” said the old hag, “thou art a stranger in this\ncastle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for I would\nspeak with thee.--And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the sick\nman's chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if you\nagain quit it without my permission!”\n\nRebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to\nsuffer her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services\nwhere she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of\nthe wounded Ivanhoe. With an understanding awake to their dangerous\nsituation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which\noccurred, Rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of\nreligion, who, she learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this\ngodless castle. She watched the return of the supposed ecclesiastic,\nwith the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour of\nthe prisoners; with what imperfect success the reader has been just\nacquainted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n     Fond wretch! and what canst thou relate,\n     But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?\n     Thy deeds are proved--thou know'st thy fate;\n     But come, thy tale--begin--begin.\n     * * * * *\n     But I have griefs of other kind,\n     Troubles and sorrows more severe;\n     Give me to ease my tortured mind,\n     Lend to my woes a patient ear;\n     And let me, if I may not find\n     A friend to help--find one to hear.\n     --Crabbe's Hall of Justice\n\nWhen Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the\napartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the\nunwilling Cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully\nsecured. Then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons,\nshe placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather asserting a\nfact than asking a question, “Thou art Saxon, father--Deny it not,” she\ncontinued, observing that Cedric hastened not to reply; “the sounds of\nmy native language are sweet to mine ears, though seldom heard save from\nthe tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom the proud\nNormans impose the meanest drudgery of this dwelling. Thou art a\nSaxon, father--a Saxon, and, save as thou art a servant of God, a\nfreeman.--Thine accents are sweet in mine ear.”\n\n“Do not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?” replied Cedric; “it\nwere, methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed children\nof the soil.”\n\n“They come not--or if they come, they better love to revel at the boards\nof their conquerors,” answered Urfried, “than to hear the groans of\ntheir countrymen--so, at least, report speaks of them--of myself I can\nsay little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to no priest save\nthe debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of\nFront-de-Boeuf, and he has been long gone to render an account of his\nstewardship.--But thou art a Saxon--a Saxon priest, and I have one\nquestion to ask of thee.”\n\n“I am a Saxon,” answered Cedric, “but unworthy, surely, of the name of\npriest. Let me begone on my way--I swear I will return, or send one of\nour fathers more worthy to hear your confession.”\n\n“Stay yet a while,” said Urfried; “the accents of the voice which thou\nhearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and I would\nnot descend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me\nstrength to tell the horrors of my tale.” She poured out a cup, and\ndrank it with a frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining the\nlast drop in the goblet. “It stupifies,” she said, looking upwards as\nshe finished her drought, “but it cannot cheer--Partake it, father, if\nyou would hear my tale without sinking down upon the pavement.” Cedric\nwould have avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality, but the\nsign which she made to him expressed impatience and despair. He complied\nwith her request, and answered her challenge in a large wine-cup; she\nthen proceeded with her story, as if appeased by his complaisance.\n\n“I was not born,” she said, “father, the wretch that thou now seest me.\nI was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and was beloved. I am now a\nslave, miserable and degraded--the sport of my masters' passions while\nI had yet beauty--the object of their contempt, scorn, and hatred,\nsince it has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should hate\nmankind, and, above all, the race that has wrought this change in me?\nCan the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself\nin impotent curses, forget she was once the daughter of the noble Thane\nof Torquilstone, before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?”\n\n“Thou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!” said Cedric, receding as he\nspoke; “thou--thou--the daughter of that noble Saxon, my father's friend\nand companion in arms!”\n\n“Thy father's friend!” echoed Urfried; “then Cedric called the Saxon\nstands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood had but one son,\nwhose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric of\nRotherwood, why this religious dress?--hast thou too despaired of saving\nthy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the\nconvent?”\n\n“It matters not who I am,” said Cedric; “proceed, unhappy woman, with\nthy tale of horror and guilt!--Guilt there must be--there is guilt even\nin thy living to tell it.”\n\n“There is--there is,” answered the wretched woman, “deep, black, damning\nguilt,--guilt, that lies like a load at my breast--guilt, that all the\npenitential fires of hereafter cannot cleanse.--Yes, in these halls,\nstained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my brethren--in\nthese very halls, to have lived the paramour of their murderer, the\nslave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to render every\nbreath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.”\n\n“Wretched woman!” exclaimed Cedric. “And while the friends of thy\nfather--while each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his\nsoul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the\nmurdered Ulrica--while all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast\nlived to merit our hate and execration--lived to unite thyself with the\nvile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearest--who shed the blood\nof infancy, rather than a male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger\nshould survive--with him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the\nhands of lawless love!”\n\n“In lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!” answered the\nhag; “love will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than\nthose unhallowed vaults.--No, with that at least I cannot reproach\nmyself--hatred to Front-de-Boeuf and his race governed my soul most\ndeeply, even in the hour of his guilty endearments.”\n\n“You hated him, and yet you lived,” replied Cedric; “wretch! was there\nno poniard--no knife--no bodkin!--Well was it for thee, since thou didst\nprize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman castle are like\nthose of the grave. For had I but dreamed of the daughter of Torquil\nliving in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of a\ntrue Saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour!”\n\n“Wouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of Torquil?”\n said Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of Urfried;\n“thou art then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even within these\naccursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself in\ninscrutable mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been sounded--and\nI, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there yet\nbreathed an avenger of our unhappy nation.--I also have had my hours of\nvengeance--I have fomented the quarrels of our foes, and heated drunken\nrevelry into murderous broil--I have seen their blood flow--I have heard\ntheir dying groans!--Look on me, Cedric--are there not still left on\nthis foul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?”\n\n“Ask me not of them, Ulrica,” replied Cedric, in a tone of grief mixed\nwith abhorrence; “these traces form such a resemblance as arises from\nthe graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse.”\n\n“Be it so,” answered Ulrica; “yet wore these fiendish features the mask\nof a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder\nFront-de-Boeuf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide\nwhat followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what\nit would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering fire of\ndiscord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son--long had I\nnursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred--it blazed forth in an hour of\ndrunken wassail, and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of\nhis own son--such are the secrets these vaults conceal!--Rend asunder,\nye accursed arches,” she added, looking up towards the roof, “and bury\nin your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!”\n\n“And thou, creature of guilt and misery,” said Cedric, “what became thy\nlot on the death of thy ravisher?”\n\n“Guess it, but ask it not.--Here--here I dwelt, till age, premature age,\nhas stamped its ghastly features on my countenance--scorned and insulted\nwhere I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which had\nonce such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented\nmenial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag--condemned\nto hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which I once\npartook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.”\n\n“Ulrica,” said Cedric, “with a heart which still, I fear, regrets the\nlost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst\nacquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who\nwears this robe? Consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted\nEdward himself do for thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal\nConfessor was endowed by heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the\nbody, but only God himself can cure the leprosy of the soul.”\n\n“Yet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,” she exclaimed, “but\ntell me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new and awful\nfeelings that burst on my solitude--Why do deeds, long since done, rise\nbefore me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate is prepared beyond\nthe grave for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such\nunspeakable wretchedness? Better had I turn to Woden, Hertha, and\nZernebock--to Mista, and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized\nancestors, than endure the dreadful anticipations which have of late\nhaunted my waking and my sleeping hours!”\n\n“I am no priest,” said Cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable\npicture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; “I am no priest, though I\nwear a priest's garment.”\n\n“Priest or layman,” answered Ulrica, “thou art the first I have seen for\ntwenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; and dost thou bid\nme despair?”\n\n“I bid thee repent,” said Cedric. “Seek to prayer and penance, and\nmayest thou find acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longer abide with\nthee.”\n\n“Stay yet a moment!” said Ulrica; “leave me not now, son of my father's\nfriend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me\nto avenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn--Thinkest thou, if\nFront-de-Boeuf found Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such a disguise,\nthat thy life would be a long one?--Already his eye has been upon thee\nlike a falcon on his prey.”\n\n“And be it so,” said Cedric; “and let him tear me with beak and talons,\nere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. I will die\na Saxon--true in word, open in deed--I bid thee avaunt!--touch me not,\nstay me not!--The sight of Front-de-Boeuf himself is less odious to me\nthan thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.”\n\n“Be it so,” said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; “go thy way, and\nforget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before thee\nis the daughter of thy father's friend.--Go thy way--if I am separated\nfrom mankind by my sufferings--separated from those whose aid I might\nmost justly expect--not less will I be separated from them in my\nrevenge!--No man shall aid me, but the ears of all men shall tingle to\nhear of the deed which I shall dare to do!--Farewell!--thy scorn has\nburst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kind--a thought\nthat my woes might claim the compassion of my people.”\n\n“Ulrica,” said Cedric, softened by this appeal, “hast thou borne up and\nendured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt thou\nnow yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when\nrepentance were thy fitter occupation?”\n\n“Cedric,” answered Ulrica, “thou little knowest the human heart. To act\nas I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires the maddening\nlove of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud\nconsciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to\nbear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long passed\naway--Age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge itself\ndies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its vipers,\nmixed with vain regrets for the past, and despair for the future!--Then,\nwhen all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the fiends\nin hell, who may feel remorse, but never repentance.--But thy words have\nawakened a new soul within me--Well hast thou said, all is possible for\nthose who dare to die!--Thou hast shown me the means of revenge, and be\nassured I will embrace them. It has hitherto shared this wasted bosom\nwith other and with rival passions--henceforward it shall possess me\nwholly, and thou thyself shalt say, that, whatever was the life of\nUlrica, her death well became the daughter of the noble Torquil. There\nis a force without beleaguering this accursed castle--hasten to lead\nthem to the attack, and when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the\nturret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press the Normans hard--they\nwill then have enough to do within, and you may win the wall in spite\nboth of bow and mangonel.--Begone, I pray thee--follow thine own fate,\nand leave me to mine.”\n\nCedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus\ndarkly announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-Boeuf was heard,\nexclaiming, “Where tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell\nof Compostella, I will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to hatch\ntreason among my domestics!”\n\n“What a true prophet,” said Ulrica, “is an evil conscience! But heed him\nnot--out and to thy people--Cry your Saxon onslaught, and let them sing\ntheir war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a burden to\nit.”\n\nAs she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald\nFront-de-Boeuf entered the apartment. Cedric, with some difficulty,\ncompelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned\nhis courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.\n\n“Thy penitents, father, have made a long shrift--it is the better for\nthem, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou prepared them\nfor death?”\n\n“I found them,” said Cedric, in such French as he could command,\n“expecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they\nhad fallen.”\n\n“How now, Sir Friar,” replied Front-de-Boeuf, “thy speech, methinks,\nsmacks of a Saxon tongue?”\n\n“I was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,” answered Cedric.\n\n“Ay?” said the Baron; “it had been better for thee to have been a\nNorman, and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice of\nmessengers. That St Withold's of Burton is an owlet's nest worth the\nharrying. The day will soon come that the frock shall protect the Saxon\nas little as the mail-coat.”\n\n“God's will be done,” said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with passion,\nwhich Front-de-Boeuf imputed to fear.\n\n“I see,” said he, “thou dreamest already that our men-at-arms are in\nthy refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holy office,\nand, come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a\nsnail within his shell of proof.”\n\n“Speak your commands,” said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.\n\n“Follow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the\npostern.”\n\nAnd as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-Boeuf\nthus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.\n\n“Thou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to\nenviron this castle of Torquilstone--Tell them whatever thou hast a mind\nof the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them\nbefore it for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thou this scroll--But\nsoft--canst read, Sir Priest?”\n\n“Not a jot I,” answered Cedric, “save on my breviary; and then I know\nthe characters, because I have the holy service by heart, praised be Our\nLady and St Withold!”\n\n“The fitter messenger for my purpose.--Carry thou this scroll to the\ncastle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and is written by\nthe Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to\nYork with all the speed man and horse can make. Meanwhile, tell him\nto doubt nothing, he shall find us whole and sound behind our\nbattlement--Shame on it, that we should be compelled to hide thus by a\npack of runagates, who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons\nand the tramp of our horses! I say to thee, priest, contrive some cast\nof thine art to keep the knaves where they are, until our friends\nbring up their lances. My vengeance is awake, and she is a falcon that\nslumbers not till she has been gorged.”\n\n“By my patron saint,” said Cedric, with deeper energy than became his\ncharacter, “and by every saint who has lived and died in England, your\ncommands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these\nwalls, if I have art and influence to detain them there.”\n\n“Ha!” said Front-de-Boeuf, “thou changest thy tone, Sir Priest, and\nspeakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the\nSaxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?”\n\nCedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would\nat this moment have been much the better of a hint from Wamba's more\nfertile brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens\ninvention, and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men\nin question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.\n\n“'Despardieux',” answered Front-de-Boeuf, “thou hast spoken the very\ntruth--I forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as well as if\nthey had been born south of yonder salt channel. Was it not he of St\nIves whom they tied to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing a mass while\nthey were rifling his mails and his wallets?--No, by our Lady--that jest\nwas played by Gualtier of Middleton, one of our own companions-at-arms.\nBut they were Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of cup,\ncandlestick and chalice, were they not?”\n\n“They were godless men,” answered Cedric.\n\n“Ay, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for\nmany a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils\nand primes!--Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.”\n\n“I am indeed bound to vengeance,” murmured Cedric; “Saint Withold knows\nmy heart.”\n\nFront-de-Boeuf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where,\npassing the moat on a single plank, they reached a small barbican,\nor exterior defence, which communicated with the open field by a\nwell-fortified sallyport.\n\n“Begone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return\nhither when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon flesh cheap as ever was\nhog's in the shambles of Sheffield. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be a\njolly confessor--come hither after the onslaught, and thou shalt have as\nmuch Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.”\n\n“Assuredly we shall meet again,” answered Cedric.\n\n“Something in hand the whilst,” continued the Norman; and, as they\nparted at the postern door, he thrust into Cedric's reluctant hand a\ngold byzant, adding, “Remember, I will fly off both cowl and skin, if\nthou failest in thy purpose.”\n\n“And full leave will I give thee to do both,” answered Cedric, leaving\nthe postern, and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step,\n“if, when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine hand.”--Turning\nthen back towards the castle, he threw the piece of gold towards the\ndonor, exclaiming at the same time, “False Norman, thy money perish with\nthee!”\n\nFront-de-Boeuf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was\nsuspicious--“Archers,” he called to the warders on the outward\nbattlements, “send me an arrow through yon monk's frock!--yet stay,” he\nsaid, as his retainers were bending their bows, “it avails not--we must\nthus far trust him since we have no better shift. I think he dares not\nbetray me--at the worst I can but treat with these Saxon dogs whom\nI have safe in kennel.--Ho! Giles jailor, let them bring Cedric of\nRotherwood before me, and the other churl, his companion--him I mean of\nConingsburgh--Athelstane there, or what call they him? Their very names\nare an encumbrance to a Norman knight's mouth, and have, as it were, a\nflavour of bacon--Give me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John said,\nthat I may wash away the relish--place it in the armoury, and thither\nlead the prisoners.”\n\nHis commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment, hung\nwith many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found\na flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon captives\nunder the guard of four of his dependants. Front-de-Boeuf took a long\ndrought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;--for the manner in\nwhich Wamba drew the cap over his face, the change of dress, the gloomy\nand broken light, and the Baron's imperfect acquaintance with the\nfeatures of Cedric, (who avoided his Norman neighbours, and seldom\nstirred beyond his own domains,) prevented him from discovering that the\nmost important of his captives had made his escape.\n\n“Gallants of England,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “how relish ye your\nentertainment at Torquilstone?--Are ye yet aware what your 'surquedy'\nand 'outrecuidance' [31] merit, for scoffing at the entertainment of\na prince of the House of Anjou?--Have ye forgotten how ye requited the\nunmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God and St Dennis, an ye pay\nnot the richer ransom, I will hang ye up by the feet from the iron bars\nof these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have made skeletons\nof you!--Speak out, ye Saxon dogs--what bid ye for your worthless\nlives?--How say you, you of Rotherwood?”\n\n“Not a doit I,” answered poor Wamba--“and for hanging up by the feet,\nmy brain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since the biggin was bound\nfirst round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore\nit again.”\n\n“Saint Genevieve!” said Front-de-Boeuf, “what have we got here?”\n\nAnd with the back of his hand he struck Cedric's cap from the head of\nthe Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of\nservitude, the silver collar round his neck.\n\n“Giles--Clement--dogs and varlets!” exclaimed the furious Norman, “what\nhave you brought me here?”\n\n“I think I can tell you,” said De Bracy, who just entered the apartment.\n“This is Cedric's clown, who fought so manful a skirmish with Isaac of\nYork about a question of precedence.”\n\n“I shall settle it for them both,” replied Front-de-Boeuf; “they\nshall hang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar of\nConingsburgh will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least\nthey can surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarms that\nare besetting the castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended\nimmunities, and live under us as serfs and vassals; too happy if, in\nthe new world that is about to begin, we leave them the breath of their\nnostrils.--Go,” said he to two of his attendants, “fetch me the right\nCedric hither, and I pardon your error for once; the rather that you but\nmistook a fool for a Saxon franklin.”\n\n“Ay, but,” said Wamba, “your chivalrous excellency will find there are\nmore fools than franklins among us.”\n\n“What means the knave?” said Front-de-Boeuf, looking towards his\nfollowers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that\nif this were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what\nwas become of him.\n\n“Saints of Heaven!” exclaimed De Bracy, “he must have escaped in the\nmonk's garments!”\n\n“Fiends of hell!” echoed Front-de-Boeuf, “it was then the boar of\nRotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed with my own\nhands!--And thou,” he said to Wamba, “whose folly could overreach the\nwisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyself--I will give thee holy\norders--I will shave thy crown for thee!--Here, let them tear the scalp\nfrom his head, and then pitch him headlong from the battlements--Thy\ntrade is to jest, canst thou jest now?”\n\n“You deal with me better than your word, noble knight,” whimpered forth\npoor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even\nby the immediate prospect of death; “if you give me the red cap you\npropose, out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.”\n\n“The poor wretch,” said De Bracy, “is resolved to die in his\nvocation.--Front-de-Boeuf, you shall not slay him. Give him to me to\nmake sport for my Free Companions.--How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou\ntake heart of grace, and go to the wars with me?”\n\n“Ay, with my master's leave,” said Wamba; “for, look you, I must\nnot slip collar” (and he touched that which he wore) “without his\npermission.”\n\n“Oh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.” said De Bracy.\n\n“Ay, noble sir,” said Wamba, “and thence goes the proverb--\n\n     'Norman saw on English oak,\n     On English neck a Norman yoke;\n     Norman spoon in English dish,\n     And England ruled as Normans wish;\n     Blithe world to England never will be more,\n     Till England's rid of all the four.'”\n\n“Thou dost well, De Bracy,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “to stand there\nlistening to a fool's jargon, when destruction is gaping for us! Seest\nthou not we are overreached, and that our proposed mode of communicating\nwith our friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley\ngentleman thou art so fond to brother? What views have we to expect but\ninstant storm?”\n\n“To the battlements then,” said De Bracy; “when didst thou ever see me\nthe graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templar yonder, and\nlet him fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his\nOrder--Make thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body--Let me do my\npoor endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as\nwell attempt to scale the clouds, as the castle of Torquilstone; or, if\nyou will treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of\nthis worthy franklin, who seems in such deep contemplation of the\nwine-flagon?--Here, Saxon,” he continued, addressing Athelstane, and\nhanding the cup to him, “rinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and\nrouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty.”\n\n“What a man of mould may,” answered Athelstane, “providing it be what a\nman of manhood ought.--Dismiss me free, with my companions, and I will\npay a ransom of a thousand marks.”\n\n“And wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who\nare swarming around the castle, contrary to God's peace and the king's?”\n said Front-de-Boeuf.\n\n“In so far as I can,” answered Athelstane, “I will withdraw them; and I\nfear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assist me.”\n\n“We are agreed then,” said Front-de-Boeuf--“thou and they are to be set\nat freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of a thousand\nmarks. It is a trifling ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to\nthe moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. But\nmark, this extends not to the Jew Isaac.”\n\n“Nor to the Jew Isaac's daughter,” said the Templar, who had now joined\nthem.\n\n“Neither,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “belong to this Saxon's company.”\n\n“I were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,” replied\nAthelstane: “deal with the unbelievers as ye list.”\n\n“Neither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,” said De Bracy. “It\nshall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize without striking a\nblow for it.”\n\n“Neither,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “does our treaty refer to this wretched\nJester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example to every knave who\nturns jest into earnest.”\n\n“The Lady Rowena,” answered Athelstane, with the most steady\ncountenance, “is my affianced bride. I will be drawn by wild horses\nbefore I consent to part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved\nthe life of my father Cedric--I will lose mine ere a hair of his head be\ninjured.”\n\n“Thy affianced bride?--The Lady Rowena the affianced bride of a vassal\nlike thee?” said De Bracy; “Saxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy\nseven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the House\nof Anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.”\n\n“My lineage, proud Norman,” replied Athelstane, “is drawn from a source\nmore pure and ancient than that of a beggarly Frenchman, whose living\nis won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his\npaltry standard. Kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in\ncouncil, who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou\ncanst number individual followers; whose names have been sung by\nminstrels, and their laws recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were\ninterred amid the prayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have\nbeen builded.”\n\n“Thou hast it, De Bracy,” said Front-de-Boeuf, well pleased with the\nrebuff which his companion had received; “the Saxon hath hit thee\nfairly.”\n\n“As fairly as a captive can strike,” said De Bracy, with apparent\ncarelessness; “for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at\nfreedom.--But thy glibness of reply, comrade,” rejoined he, speaking to\nAthelstane, “will not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.”\n\nTo this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his\ncustom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. The\nconversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced\nthat a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.\n\n“In the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,” said\nFront-de-Boeuf, “have we a real monk this time, or another impostor?\nSearch him, slaves--for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed\nupon you, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coals put into the\nsockets.”\n\n“Let me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,” said Giles, “if\nthis be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows him well, and\nwill vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the\nPrior of Jorvaulx.”\n\n“Admit him,” said Front-de-Boeuf; “most likely he brings us news from\nhis jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests are\nrelieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the\ncountry. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think on what thou hast\nheard.”\n\n“I claim,” said Athelstane, “an honourable imprisonment, with due care\nof my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one\nwho is in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself the\nbest of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on\nmy freedom. This defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer;\nthou underliest it, and art bound to answer me--There lies my glove.”\n\n“I answer not the challenge of my prisoner,” said Front-de-Boeuf;\n“nor shalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.--Giles,” he continued, “hang the\nfranklin's glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall\nit remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume to demand it,\nor to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of Saint\nChristopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe\non foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!”\n\nThe Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced\nthe monk Ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.\n\n“This is the real 'Deus vobiscum',” said Wamba, as he passed the\nreverend brother; “the others were but counterfeits.”\n\n“Holy Mother,” said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, “I\nam at last safe and in Christian keeping!”\n\n“Safe thou art,” replied De Bracy; “and for Christianity, here is the\nstout Baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, whose utter abomination is a Jew;\nand the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to\nslay Saracens--If these are not good marks of Christianity, I know no\nother which they bear about them.”\n\n“Ye are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior\nof Jorvaulx,” said the monk, without noticing the tone of De Bracy's\nreply; “ye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what\nsaith the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise 'De Civitate Dei'---”\n\n“What saith the devil!” interrupted Front-de-Boeuf; “or rather what dost\nthou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts from the holy\nfathers.”\n\n“'Sancta Maria!'” ejaculated Father Ambrose, “how prompt to ire are\nthese unhallowed laymen!--But be it known to you, brave knights,\nthat certain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and\nreverence of his church, and not regarding the bull of the holy see, 'Si\nquis, suadende Diabolo'---”\n\n“Brother priest,” said the Templar, “all this we know or guess at--tell\nus plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and to whom?”\n\n“Surely,” said Ambrose, “he is in the hands of the men of Belial,\ninfesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, 'Touch not\nmine anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.'”\n\n“Here is a new argument for our swords, sirs,” said Front-de-Boeuf,\nturning to his companions; “and so, instead of reaching us any\nassistance, the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is\nwell helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!--But speak\nout, priest, and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?”\n\n“So please you,” said Ambrose, “violent hands having been imposed on my\nreverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance which I did already\nquote, and the men of Belial having rifled his mails and budgets, and\nstripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold, they do yet\ndemand of him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart\nfrom their uncircumcised hands. Wherefore the reverend father in God\nprays you, as his dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down\nthe ransom at which they hold him, or by force of arms, at your best\ndiscretion.”\n\n“The foul fiend quell the Prior!” said Front-de-Boeuf; “his morning's\ndrought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of a Norman baron\nunbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten times\nas weighty as ours?--And how can we do aught by valour to free him, that\nare cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every\nmoment?”\n\n“And that was what I was about to tell you,” said the monk, “had your\nhastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, and these foul\nonslaughts distract an aged man's brain. Nevertheless, it is of verity\nthat they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this\ncastle.”\n\n“To the battlements!” cried De Bracy, “and let us mark what these knaves\ndo without;” and so saying, he opened a latticed window which led to\na sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called from\nthence to those in the apartment--“Saint Dennis, but the old monk hath\nbrought true tidings!--They bring forward mantelets and pavisses, [32]\nand the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud\nbefore a hailstorm.”\n\nReginald Front-de-Boeuf also looked out upon the field, and immediately\nsnatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded\nhis men to their posts on the walls.\n\n“De Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest--Noble\nBois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and defend,\nlook thou to the western side--I myself will take post at the barbican.\nYet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble friends!--we\nmust this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves, were it possible,\nso as to carry by our presence succour and relief wherever the attack is\nhottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and courage may supply that\ndefect, since we have only to do with rascal clowns.”\n\n“But, noble knights,” exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle and\nconfusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, “will none of\nye hear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of\nJorvaulx?--I beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!”\n\n“Go patter thy petitions to heaven,” said the fierce Norman, “for we\non earth have no time to listen to them.--Ho! there, Anselm I see that\nseething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these audacious\ntraitors--Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts. [33]--Fling abroad\nmy banner with the old bull's head--the knaves shall soon find with whom\nthey have to do this day!”\n\n“But, noble sir,” continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours\nto draw attention, “consider my vow of obedience, and let me discharge\nmyself of my Superior's errand.”\n\n“Away with this prating dotard,” said Front-de Boeuf, “lock him up in\nthe chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be a new\nthing to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have\nnot been so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out of stone.”\n\n“Blaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,” said De Bracy, “we shall\nhave need of their aid to-day before yon rascal rout disband.”\n\n“I expect little aid from their hand,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “unless we\nwere to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the villains.\nThere is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufficient to bear a\nwhole company to the earth.”\n\nThe Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of\nthe besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutal Front-de-Boeuf\nor his giddy companion.\n\n“By the faith of mine order,” he said, “these men approach with more\ntouch of discipline than could have been judged, however they come by\nit. See ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which\na tree or bush affords, and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our\ncross-bows? I spy neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will\nI gage my golden chain, that they are led on by some noble knight or\ngentleman, skilful in the practice of wars.”\n\n“I espy him,” said De Bracy; “I see the waving of a knight's crest,\nand the gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the black mail, who is\nbusied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomen--by Saint\nDennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called 'Le Noir Faineant', who\noverthrew thee, Front-de-Boeuf, in the lists at Ashby.”\n\n“So much the better,” said Front-de-Boeuf, “that he comes here to give\nme my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who dared not stay to\nassert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I\nshould in vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their\nfoes, and right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain\nyeomanry.”\n\nThe demonstrations of the enemy's immediate approach cut off all farther\ndiscourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at the head of the\nfew followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in numbers\ninadequate to defend the whole extent of the walls, they awaited with\ncalm determination the threatened assault.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n     This wandering race, sever'd from other men,\n     Boast yet their intercourse with human arts;\n     The seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt,\n     Find them acquainted with their secret treasures:\n     And unregarded herbs, and flowers, and blossoms,\n     Display undreamt-of powers when gather'd by them.\n     --The Jew\n\nOur history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to\ninform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the\nrest of this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have\neasily anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by\nall the world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her\nfather to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to\nthe house which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.\n\nIt would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in\nany other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. But\nhe had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted\npeople, and those were to be conquered.\n\n“Holy Abraham!” he exclaimed, “he is a good youth, and my heart bleeds\nto see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his\ncorslet of goodly price--but to carry him to our house!--damsel, hast\nthou well considered?--he is a Christian, and by our law we may not deal\nwith the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.”\n\n“Speak not so, my dear father,” replied Rebecca; “we may not indeed mix\nwith them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the\nGentile becometh the Jew's brother.”\n\n“I would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,”\n replied Isaac;--“nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death.\nLet Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.”\n\n“Nay, let them place him in my litter,” said Rebecca; “I will mount one\nof the palfreys.”\n\n“That were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of\nEdom,” whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of\nknights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her\ncharitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until\nIsaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried\nvoice--“Beard of Aaron!--what if the youth perish!--if he die in our\ncustody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces\nby the multitude?”\n\n“He will not die, my father,” said Rebecca, gently extricating herself\nfrom the grasp of Isaac “he will not die unless we abandon him; and if\nso, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.”\n\n“Nay,” said Isaac, releasing his hold, “it grieveth me as much to see\nthe drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from mine\nown purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the\nRabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made thee\nskilful in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs,\nand the force of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth thee--thou\nart a good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto\nme and unto my house, and unto the people of my fathers.”\n\nThe apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the\ngenerous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her\nreturn to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The\nTemplar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold\nand ardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the\nconsequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident\nthrew her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.\n\nRebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their\ntemporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and\nto bind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic\nballads, must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as\nthey are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how\nfrequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her\ncure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.\n\nBut the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical\nscience in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of the\ntime frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced\nsage among this despised people, when wounded or in sickness. The aid\nof the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though\na general belief prevailed among the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins\nwere deeply acquainted with the occult sciences, and particularly with\nthe cabalistical art, which had its name and origin in the studies of\nthe sages of Israel. Neither did the Rabbins disown such acquaintance\nwith supernatural arts, which added nothing (for what could add aught?)\nto the hatred with which their nation was regarded, while it diminished\nthe contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician\nmight be the subject of equal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer, but he\ncould not be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the\nwonderful cures they are said to have performed, that the Jews possessed\nsome secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with\nthe exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great\ncare to conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.\n\nThe beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge\nproper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained,\narranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years,\nher sex, and even the age in which she lived. Her knowledge of medicine\nand of the healing art had been acquired under an aged Jewess, the\ndaughter of one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved Rebecca as\nher own child, and was believed to have communicated to her secrets,\nwhich had been left to herself by her sage father at the same time, and\nunder the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed been to fall\na sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived\nin her apt pupil.\n\nRebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally\nrevered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of\nthose gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself,\nout of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself\nwith his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty\nthan was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her\npeople, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion,\neven in preference to his own.\n\nWhen Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state\nof unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken\nplace during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound,\nand having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed,\ninformed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great\nbleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of\nMiriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest's\nlife, and that he might with safety travel to York with them on the\nensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His\ncharity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would\nhave left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he\nwas residing at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it\nbelonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however,\nRebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that\nhad peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no\naccount put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another\nphysician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be\ndiscovered; the other, that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was\nan intimate favourite of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and that, in case the\nmonarch should return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John with\ntreasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small\nneed of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richard's favour.\n\n“Thou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,” said Isaac, giving way to these\nweighty arguments--“it were an offending of Heaven to betray the secrets\nof the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not rashly\nto be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and\nshekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise\nphysician--assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom\nProvidence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England\ncall the Lion's Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the\nhands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got\nassurance of my dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to\nthy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our\nhouse shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. And if\nhe of the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad,\nthen shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence, when\nthe king's displeasure shall burn high against thy father. And if he\ndoth not return, this Wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he\nshall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword, even\nas he did yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good youth,\nand keepeth the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that which he\nborroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my father's\nhouse, when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons of Belial.”\n\nIt was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to\nconsciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under\nthe confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery\nfrom a state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall\nexactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the\nlists, or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had\nbeen engaged upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined\nto great weakness and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection\nof blows dealt and received, of steeds rushing upon each other,\noverthrowing and overthrown--of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the\nheady tumult of a confused fight. An effort to draw aside the curtain of\nhis couch was in some degree successful, although rendered difficult by\nthe pain of his wound.\n\nTo his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently\nfurnished, but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in\nother respects partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to\ndoubt whether he had not, during his sleep, been transported back\nagain to the land of Palestine. The impression was increased, when,\nthe tapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in a rich habit,\nwhich partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided\nthrough the door which it concealed, and was followed by a swarthy\ndomestic.\n\nAs the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she\nimposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while\nthe attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe's side, and\nthe lovely Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place,\nand the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful and\ndignified simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more civilized\ndays, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to\nfemale delicacy. The idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in\nattendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different\nsex, was melted away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing\nher effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death.\nRebecca's few and brief directions were given in the Hebrew language\nto the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her assistant in\nsimilar cases, obeyed them without reply.\n\nThe accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded\nwhen uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca,\nthe romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms\npronounced by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear,\nbut, from the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which\naccompanied them, touching and affecting to the heart. Without making\nan attempt at further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take\nthe measures they thought most proper for his recovery; and it was not\nuntil those were completed, and this kind physician about to retire,\nthat his curiosity could no longer be suppressed.--“Gentle maiden,” he\nbegan in the Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels had rendered\nhim familiar, and which he thought most likely to be understood by the\nturban'd and caftan'd damsel who stood before him--“I pray you, gentle\nmaiden, of your courtesy---”\n\nBut here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she\ncould scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general\nexpression was that of contemplative melancholy. “I am of England, Sir\nKnight, and speak the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage\nbelong to another climate.”\n\n“Noble damsel,”--again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca\nhastened to interrupt him.\n\n“Bestow not on me, Sir Knight,” she said, “the epithet of noble. It is\nwell you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor Jewess, the\ndaughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good and\nkind lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to\nyou such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.”\n\nI know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied\nwith the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto\ngazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of\nthe lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,\nmellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a\nminstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays\nthrough a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to\nretain the same class of feelings towards a Jewess. This Rebecca had\nforeseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her\nfather's name and lineage; yet--for the fair and wise daughter of Isaac\nwas not without a touch of female weakness--she could not but sigh\ninternally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether\nunmixed with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his\nunknown benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed,\nand collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which\nexpressed a grateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected\nquarter, and from one of an inferior race. It was not that Ivanhoe's\nformer carriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which\nyouth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that one word should\noperate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could not be supposed\naltogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a degraded class,\nto whom it could not be honourably rendered.\n\nBut the gentleness and candour of Rebecca's nature imputed no fault to\nIvanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion.\nOn the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now\nregarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was\ndisgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased\nnot to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and\nconvalescence. She informed him of the necessity they were under of\nremoving to York, and of her father's resolution to transport him\nthither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be\nrestored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan, which he\ngrounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.\n\n“Was there not,” he said, “in Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin,\nor even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a wounded\ncountryman's residence with him until he should be again able to bear\nhis armour?--Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could be\nreceived?--Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he was\nsure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold's, to\nwhom he was related?”\n\n“Any, the worst of these harbourages,” said Rebecca, with a melancholy\nsmile, “would unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the\nabode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss your\nphysician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well know,\ncan cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own\nfamily, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since\nthe days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the\nadvantages. No Nazarene--I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight--no\nChristian leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to\nbear your corslet within a month.”\n\n“And how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?” said Ivanhoe,\nimpatiently.\n\n“Within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my\ndirections,” replied Rebecca.\n\n“By Our Blessed Lady,” said Wilfred, “if it be not a sin to name her\nhere, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if\nthou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full\nof crowns, come by them as I may.”\n\n“I will accomplish my promise,” said Rebecca, “and thou shalt bear thine\narmour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one boon\nin the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.”\n\n“If it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield\nto one of thy people,” replied Ivanhoe, “I will grant thy boon blithely\nand thankfully.”\n\n“Nay,” answered Rebecca, “I will but pray of thee to believe\nhenceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without\ndesiring other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made\nboth Jew and Gentile.”\n\n“It were sin to doubt it, maiden,” replied Ivanhoe; “and I repose myself\non thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting you will\nenable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind leech,\nlet me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon Cedric and\nhis household?--what of the lovely Lady--” He stopt, as if unwilling\nto speak Rowena's name in the house of a Jew--“Of her, I mean, who was\nnamed Queen of the tournament?”\n\n“And who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with\njudgment which was admired as much as your valour,” replied Rebecca.\n\nThe blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing\nhis cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in\nRowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.\n\n“It was less of her I would speak,” said he, “than of Prince John; and I\nwould fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends me\nnot?”\n\n“Let me use my authority as a leech,” answered Rebecca, “and enjoin you\nto keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize you\nof what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament,\nand set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights, and\nchurchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring,\nby fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the\nland. It is said he designs to assume his brother's crown.”\n\n“Not without a blow struck in its defence,” said Ivanhoe, raising\nhimself upon the couch, “if there were but one true subject in England I\nwill fight for Richard's title with the best of them--ay, one or two, in\nhis just quarrel!”\n\n“But that you may be able to do so,” said Rebecca touching his shoulder\nwith her hand, “you must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.”\n\n“True, maiden,” said Ivanhoe, “as quiet as these disquieted times will\npermit--And of Cedric and his household?”\n\n“His steward came but brief while since,” said the Jewess, “panting with\nhaste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth\nof Cedric's flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane\nof Coningsburgh had left Prince John's lodging in high displeasure, and\nwere about to set forth on their return homeward.”\n\n“Went any lady with them to the banquet?” said Wilfred.\n\n“The Lady Rowena,” said Rebecca, answering the question with more\nprecision than it had been asked--“The Lady Rowena went not to the\nPrince's feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her\njourney back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your\nfaithful squire Gurth---”\n\n“Ha!” exclaimed the knight, “knowest thou his name?--But thou dost,” he\nimmediately added, “and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,\nas I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he\nreceived but yesterday a hundred zecchins.”\n\n“Speak not of that,” said Rebecca, blushing deeply; “I see how easy it\nis for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.”\n\n“But this sum of gold,” said Ivanhoe, gravely, “my honour is concerned\nin repaying it to your father.”\n\n“Let it be as thou wilt,” said Rebecca, “when eight days have passed\naway; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy\nrecovery.”\n\n“Be it so, kind maiden,” said Ivanhoe; “I were most ungrateful to\ndispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and I have\ndone with questioning thee.”\n\n“I grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,” answered the Jewess, “that he is in\ncustody by the order of Cedric.”--And then observing the distress which\nher communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, “But the steward\nOswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his master's displeasure\nagainst him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a faithful\nserf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed\nthis error out of the love which he bore to Cedric's son. And he said,\nmoreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the Jester,\nwere resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case\nCedric's ire against him could not be mitigated.”\n\n“Would to God they may keep their purpose!” said Ivanhoe; “but it seems\nas if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to\nme. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest\nthat the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his\ncrown;--my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of\nher sex;--and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman\nbut for his love and loyal service to me!--Thou seest, maiden, what an\nill-fated wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere\nthe misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve\nthee also in their pursuit.”\n\n“Nay,” said Rebecca, “thy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee\nmiscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy\ncountry when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true\nheart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy\nking, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which\nthou hast sustained, seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a helper\nand a physician, even among the most despised of the land?--Therefore,\nbe of good courage, and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel\nwhich thine arm shall work before this people. Adieu--and having taken\nthe medicine which I shall send thee by the hand of Reuben, compose\nthyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the\njourney on the succeeding day.”\n\nIvanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of\nRebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative\nand narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed\nslumbers. In the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from\nfeverish symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.\n\nHe was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the\nlists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one\ncircumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure\nsufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac,\nlike the enriched traveller of Juvenal's tenth satire, had ever the fear\nof robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike accounted\nfair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He\ntherefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts, and shorter\nrepasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had several\nhours the start of him, but who had been delayed by their protracted\nfeasting at the convent of Saint Withold's. Yet such was the virtue of\nMiriam's balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoe's constitution, that\nhe did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his\nkind physician had apprehended.\n\nIn another point of view, however, the Jew's haste proved somewhat more\nthan good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred\nseveral disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend\nhim as a guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means from\nthe national love of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized\nas laziness and gluttony. Reversing Shylock's position, they had\naccepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and\nwere very much displeased when they found themselves disappointed,\nby the rapidity with which he insisted on their proceeding. They\nremonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their horses by these\nforced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a\ndeadly feud, concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for\nconsumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that when the alarm of\ndanger approached, and that which Isaac feared was likely to come upon\nhim, he was deserted by the discontented mercenaries on whose protection\nhe had relied, without using the means necessary to secure their\nattachment.\n\nIn this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded\npatient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon\nafterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates.\nLittle notice was at first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have\nremained behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it\nunder the impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise,\nfor Rowena had not unveiled herself. But De Bracy's astonishment was\nconsiderable, when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded\nman, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of Saxon\noutlaws, with whom his name might be a protection for himself and his\nfriends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\n\nThe ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity,\nnever utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight\nany injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his\nbetraying him to Front-de-Boeuf, who would have had no scruples to put\nto death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of\nIvanhoe. On the other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady\nRowena, as the events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfred's previous\nbanishment from his father's house, had made matter of notoriety, was\na pitch far above the flight of De Bracy's generosity. A middle\ncourse betwixt good and evil was all which he found himself capable of\nadopting, and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the\nlitter, and to suffer no one to approach it. If questioned, they were\ndirected by their master to say, that the empty litter of the Lady\nRowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been\nwounded in the scuffle. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the Knight\nTemplar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own\nschemes, the one on the Jew's treasure, and the other on his daughter,\nDe Bracy's squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded\ncomrade, to a distant apartment. This explanation was accordingly\nreturned by these men to Front-de-Boeuf, when he questioned them why\nthey did not make for the battlements upon the alarm.\n\n“A wounded companion!” he replied in great wrath and astonishment. “No\nwonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay leaguer\nbefore castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to nobles,\nsince men-at-arms have turned sick men's nurses, and Free Companions are\ngrown keepers of dying folk's curtains, when the castle is about to be\nassailed.--To the battlements, ye loitering villains!” he exclaimed,\nraising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again, “to the\nbattlements, or I will splinter your bones with this truncheon!”\n\nThe men sulkily replied, “that they desired nothing better than to go to\nthe battlements, providing Front-de-Boeuf would bear them out with their\nmaster, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.”\n\n“The dying man, knaves!” rejoined the Baron; “I promise thee we shall\nall be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I\nwill relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.--Here,\nUrfried--hag--fiend of a Saxon witch--hearest me not?--tend me this\nbedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves\nuse their weapons.--Here be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and\nquarrells [34]--to the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt\nthrough a Saxon brain.”\n\nThe men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise\nand detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were\ncommanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried,\nor Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries\nand with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca\nthe care of her patient.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n     Ascend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,\n     Look on the field, and say how goes the battle.\n     --Schiller's Maid of Orleans\n\nA moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and\naffection. We are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our\nfeelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil\nperiods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether\nsuppress them. In finding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe,\nRebecca was astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she\nexperienced, even at a time when all around them both was danger, if not\ndespair. As she felt his pulse, and enquired after his health, there was\na softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest\nthan she would herself have been pleased to have voluntarily expressed.\nHer voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was only the cold\nquestion of Ivanhoe, “Is it you, gentle maiden?” which recalled her to\nherself, and reminded her the sensations which she felt were not and\ncould not be mutual. A sigh escaped, but it was scarce audible; and the\nquestions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health were\nput in the tone of calm friendship. Ivanhoe answered her hastily that\nhe was, in point of health, as well, and better than he could have\nexpected--“Thanks,” he said, “dear Rebecca, to thy helpful skill.”\n\n“He calls me DEAR Rebecca,” said the maiden to herself, “but it is in\nthe cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His war-horse--his\nhunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised Jewess!”\n\n“My mind, gentle maiden,” continued Ivanhoe, “is more disturbed by\nanxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of those men who\nwere my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge\naright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence\non some military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-Boeuf--If so, how\nwill this end, or how can I protect Rowena and my father?”\n\n“He names not the Jew or Jewess,” said Rebecca internally; “yet what is\nour portion in him, and how justly am I punished by Heaven for\nletting my thoughts dwell upon him!” She hastened after this brief\nself-accusation to give Ivanhoe what information she could; but it\namounted only to this, that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the\nBaron Front-de-Boeuf, were commanders within the castle; that it was\nbeleaguered from without, but by whom she knew not. She added, that\nthere was a Christian priest within the castle who might be possessed of\nmore information.\n\n“A Christian priest!” said the knight, joyfully; “fetch him hither,\nRebecca, if thou canst--say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel--say\nwhat thou wilt, but bring him--something I must do or attempt, but how\ncan I determine until I know how matters stand without?”\n\nRebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to\nbring Cedric into the wounded Knight's chamber, which was defeated as we\nhave already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been on\nthe watch to intercept the supposed monk. Rebecca retired to communicate\nto Ivanhoe the result of her errand.\n\nThey had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of\nintelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for the\nnoise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations which\nhad been considerable for some time, now increased into tenfold bustle\nand clamour. The heavy, yet hasty step of the men-at-arms, traversed the\nbattlements or resounded on the narrow and winding passages and stairs\nwhich led to the various bartisans and points of defence. The voices of\nthe knights were heard, animating their followers, or directing means\nof defence, while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of\narmour, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they addressed. Tremendous\nas these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the awful event which\nthey presaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which Rebecca's\nhigh-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. Her eye\nkindled, although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a\nstrong mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as she\nrepeated, half whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion,\nthe sacred text,--“The quiver rattleth--the glittering spear and the\nshield--the noise of the captains and the shouting!”\n\nBut Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with\nimpatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle in\nthe affray of which these sounds were the introduction. “If I could\nbut drag myself,” he said, “to yonder window, that I might see how\nthis brave game is like to go--If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or\nbattle-axe to strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!--It\nis in vain--it is in vain--I am alike nerveless and weaponless!”\n\n“Fret not thyself, noble knight,” answered Rebecca, “the sounds have\nceased of a sudden--it may be they join not battle.”\n\n“Thou knowest nought of it,” said Wilfred, impatiently; “this dead pause\nonly shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and expecting\nan instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering of\nthe storm--it will burst anon in all its fury.--Could I but reach yonder\nwindow!”\n\n“Thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,” replied his\nattendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she firmly added, “I myself\nwill stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what passes\nwithout.”\n\n“You must not--you shall not!” exclaimed Ivanhoe; “each lattice, each\naperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random shaft--”\n\n“It shall be welcome!” murmured Rebecca, as with firm pace she ascended\ntwo or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.\n\n“Rebecca, dear Rebecca!” exclaimed Ivanhoe, “this is no maiden's\npastime--do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and render me for\never miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself\nwith yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of your person at the\nlattice as may be.”\n\nFollowing with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and\navailing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which\nshe placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with tolerable\nsecurity to herself, could witness part of what was passing without the\ncastle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were\nmaking for the storm. Indeed the situation which she thus obtained was\npeculiarly favourable for this purpose, because, being placed on an\nangle of the main building, Rebecca could not only see what passed\nbeyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of the\noutwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault. It was\nan exterior fortification of no great height or strength, intended\nto protect the postern-gate, through which Cedric had been recently\ndismissed by Front-de-Boeuf. The castle moat divided this species of\nbarbican from the rest of the fortress, so that, in case of its being\ntaken, it was easy to cut off the communication with the main building,\nby withdrawing the temporary bridge. In the outwork was a sallyport\ncorresponding to the postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded\nby a strong palisade. Rebecca could observe, from the number of men\nplaced for the defence of this post, that the besieged entertained\napprehensions for its safety; and from the mustering of the assailants\nin a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it seemed no less plain\nthat it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack.\n\nThese appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, “The\nskirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are\nadvanced from its dark shadow.”\n\n“Under what banner?” asked Ivanhoe.\n\n“Under no ensign of war which I can observe,” answered Rebecca.\n\n“A singular novelty,” muttered the knight, “to advance to storm such a\ncastle without pennon or banner displayed!--Seest thou who they be that\nact as leaders?”\n\n“A knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,” said the\nJewess; “he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the\ndirection of all around him.”\n\n“What device does he bear on his shield?” replied Ivanhoe.\n\n“Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the\nblack shield.” [35]\n\n“A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,” said Ivanhoe; “I know not who may\nbear the device, but well I ween it might now be mine own. Canst thou\nnot see the motto?”\n\n“Scarce the device itself at this distance,” replied Rebecca; “but when\nthe sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you.”\n\n“Seem there no other leaders?” exclaimed the anxious enquirer.\n\n“None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,” said\nRebecca; “but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also assailed.\nThey appear even now preparing to advance--God of Zion, protect\nus!--What a dreadful sight!--Those who advance first bear huge shields\nand defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows\nas they come on.--They raise their bows!--God of Moses, forgive the\ncreatures thou hast made!”\n\nHer description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,\nwhich was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by\na flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which,\nmingled with the deep and hollow clang of the nakers, (a species of\nkettle-drum,) retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy.\nThe shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din, the assailants\ncrying, “Saint George for merry England!” and the Normans answering\nthem with loud cries of “En avant De Bracy!--Beau-seant!\nBeau-seant!--Front-de-Boeuf a la rescousse!” according to the war-cries\nof their different commanders.\n\nIt was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and\nthe desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous\ndefence on the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their\nwoodland pastimes to the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to\nuse the appropriate phrase of the time, so “wholly together,” that\nno point at which a defender could show the least part of his person,\nescaped their cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which\ncontinued as thick and sharp as hail, while, notwithstanding, every\narrow had its individual aim, and flew by scores together against each\nembrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as at every window where\na defender either occasionally had post, or might be suspected to be\nstationed,--by this sustained discharge, two or three of the garrison\nwere slain, and several others wounded. But, confident in their armour\nof proof, and in the cover which their situation afforded, the followers\nof Front-de-Boeuf, and his allies, showed an obstinacy in defence\nproportioned to the fury of the attack and replied with the discharge\nof their large cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows, slings, and\nother missile weapons, to the close and continued shower of arrows;\nand, as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently protected, did\nconsiderably more damage than they received at their hand. The whizzing\nof shafts and of missiles, on both sides, was only interrupted by the\nshouts which arose when either side inflicted or sustained some notable\nloss.\n\n“And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,” exclaimed Ivanhoe, “while\nthe game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of\nothers!--Look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that\nyou are not marked by the archers beneath--Look out once more, and tell\nme if they yet advance to the storm.”\n\nWith patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had\nemployed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the lattice,\nsheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.\n\n“What dost thou see, Rebecca?” again demanded the wounded knight.\n\n“Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes,\nand to hide the bowmen who shoot them.”\n\n“That cannot endure,” said Ivanhoe; “if they press not right on to\ncarry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but little\nagainst stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the Fetterlock,\nfair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so\nwill his followers be.”\n\n“I see him not,” said Rebecca.\n\n“Foul craven!” exclaimed Ivanhoe; “does he blench from the helm when the\nwind blows highest?”\n\n“He blenches not! he blenches not!” said Rebecca, “I see him now; he\nleads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican. [36]\n--They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers\nwith axes.--His high black plume floats abroad over the throng, like\na raven over the field of the slain.--They have made a breach in the\nbarriers--they rush in--they are thrust back!--Front-de-Boeuf heads the\ndefenders; I see his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to\nthe breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to man. God\nof Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides--the conflict of two\noceans moved by adverse winds!”\n\nShe turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a\nsight so terrible.\n\n“Look forth again, Rebecca,” said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her\nretiring; “the archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are\nnow fighting hand to hand.--Look again, there is now less danger.”\n\nRebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, “Holy\nprophets of the law! Front-de-Boeuf and the Black Knight fight hand\nto hand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the\nprogress of the strife--Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed\nand of the captive!” She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, “He\nis down!--he is down!”\n\n“Who is down?” cried Ivanhoe; “for our dear Lady's sake, tell me which\nhas fallen?”\n\n“The Black Knight,” answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again\nshouted with joyful eagerness--“But no--but no!--the name of the Lord\nof Hosts be blessed!--he is on foot again, and fights as if there\nwere twenty men's strength in his single arm--His sword is broken--he\nsnatches an axe from a yeoman--he presses Front-de-Boeuf with blow on\nblow--The giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the\nwoodman--he falls--he falls!”\n\n“Front-de-Boeuf?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.\n\n“Front-de-Boeuf!” answered the Jewess; “his men rush to the rescue,\nheaded by the haughty Templar--their united force compels the champion\nto pause--They drag Front-de-Boeuf within the walls.”\n\n“The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?” said Ivanhoe.\n\n“They have--they have!” exclaimed Rebecca--“and they press the besieged\nhard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and\nendeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other--down go stones,\nbeams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as fast as they\nbear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the\nassault--Great God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should\nbe thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!”\n\n“Think not of that,” said Ivanhoe; “this is no time for such\nthoughts--Who yield?--who push their way?”\n\n“The ladders are thrown down,” replied Rebecca, shuddering; “the\nsoldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles--The besieged\nhave the better.”\n\n“Saint George strike for us!” exclaimed the knight; “do the false yeomen\ngive way?”\n\n“No!” exclaimed Rebecca, “they bear themselves right yeomanly--the Black\nKnight approaches the postern with his huge axe--the thundering blows\nwhich he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of\nthe battle--Stones and beams are hailed down on the bold champion--he\nregards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!”\n\n“By Saint John of Acre,” said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his\ncouch, “methought there was but one man in England that might do such a\ndeed!”\n\n“The postern gate shakes,” continued Rebecca; “it crashes--it is\nsplintered by his blows--they rush in--the outwork is won--Oh,\nGod!--they hurl the defenders from the battlements--they throw them\ninto the moat--O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no\nlonger!”\n\n“The bridge--the bridge which communicates with the castle--have they\nwon that pass?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.\n\n“No,” replied Rebecca, “The Templar has destroyed the plank on which\nthey crossed--few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle--the\nshrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others--Alas!--I\nsee it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle.”\n\n“What do they now, maiden?” said Ivanhoe; “look forth yet again--this is\nno time to faint at bloodshed.”\n\n“It is over for the time,” answered Rebecca; “our friends strengthen\nthemselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and it affords\nthem so good a shelter from the foemen's shot, that the garrison only\nbestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as if rather to\ndisquiet than effectually to injure them.”\n\n“Our friends,” said Wilfred, “will surely not abandon an enterprise so\ngloriously begun and so happily attained.--O no! I will put my faith\nin the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of\niron.--Singular,” he again muttered to himself, “if there be two who can\ndo a deed of such derring-do! [37]--a fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on\na field sable--what may that mean?--seest thou nought else, Rebecca, by\nwhich the Black Knight may be distinguished?”\n\n“Nothing,” said the Jewess; “all about him is black as the wing of the\nnight raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further--but having\nonce seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know\nhim again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he were\nsummoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there seems as\nif the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every\nblow which he deals upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the sin of\nbloodshed!--it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and\nheart of one man can triumph over hundreds.”\n\n“Rebecca,” said Ivanhoe, “thou hast painted a hero; surely they rest\nbut to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the\nmoat--Under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there\nare no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant\nemprize; since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also\nglorious. I swear by the honour of my house--I vow by the name of my\nbright lady-love, I would endure ten years' captivity to fight one day\nby that good knight's side in such a quarrel as this!”\n\n“Alas,” said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and approaching\nthe couch of the wounded knight, “this impatient yearning after\naction--this struggling with and repining at your present weakness,\nwill not fail to injure your returning health--How couldst thou hope\nto inflict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast\nreceived?”\n\n“Rebecca,” he replied, “thou knowest not how impossible it is for one\ntrained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a\nwoman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of\nbattle is the food upon which we live--the dust of the 'melee' is the\nbreath of our nostrils! We live not--we wish not to live--longer than\nwhile we are victorious and renowned--Such, maiden, are the laws of\nchivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold\ndear.”\n\n“Alas!” said the fair Jewess, “and what is it, valiant knight, save an\noffering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing through\nthe fire to Moloch?--What remains to you as the prize of all the blood\nyou have spilled--of all the travail and pain you have endured--of\nall the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the\nstrong man's spear, and overtaken the speed of his war-horse?”\n\n“What remains?” cried Ivanhoe; “Glory, maiden, glory! which gilds our\nsepulchre and embalms our name.”\n\n“Glory?” continued Rebecca; “alas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a\nhatchment over the champion's dim and mouldering tomb--is the defaced\nsculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to\nthe enquiring pilgrim--are these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice\nof every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may\nmake others miserable? Or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of\na wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and\nhappiness, are so wildly bartered, to become the hero of those ballads\nwhich vagabond minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?”\n\n“By the soul of Hereward!” replied the knight impatiently, “thou\nspeakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quench the pure\nlight of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base,\nthe gentle knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our life\nfar, far beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over\npain, toil, and suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace.\nThou art no Christian, Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high\nfeelings which swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover hath\ndone some deed of emprize which sanctions his flame. Chivalry!--why,\nmaiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection--the stay of the\noppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the\ntyrant--Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds\nthe best protection in her lance and her sword.”\n\n“I am, indeed,” said Rebecca, “sprung from a race whose courage was\ndistinguished in the defence of their own land, but who warred not, even\nwhile yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in defending\ntheir country from oppression. The sound of the trumpet wakes Judah no\nlonger, and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims\nof hostile and military oppression. Well hast thou spoken, Sir\nKnight,--until the God of Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a\nsecond Gideon, or a new Maccabeus, it ill beseemeth the Jewish damsel to\nspeak of battle or of war.”\n\nThe high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow, which\ndeeply expressed her sense of the degradation of her people, embittered\nperhaps by the idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled\nto interfere in a case of honour, and incapable of entertaining or\nexpressing sentiments of honour and generosity.\n\n“How little he knows this bosom,” she said, “to imagine that cowardice\nor meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because I have censured\nthe fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the\nshedding of mine own blood, drop by drop, could redeem the captivity of\nJudah! Nay, would to God it could avail to set free my father, and this\nhis benefactor, from the chains of the oppressor! The proud Christian\nshould then see whether the daughter of God's chosen people dared not to\ndie as bravely as the vainest Nazarene maiden, that boasts her descent\nfrom some petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north!”\n\nShe then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.\n\n“He sleeps,” she said; “nature exhausted by sufferance and the waste\nof spirits, his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary\nrelaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look\nupon him, when it may be for the last time?--When yet but a short space,\nand those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and\nbuoyant spirit which forsakes them not even in sleep!--When the nostril\nshall be distended, the mouth agape, the eyes fixed and bloodshot; and\nwhen the proud and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest caitiff\nof this accursed castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up against\nhim!--And my father!--oh, my father! evil is it with his daughter,\nwhen his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden locks of\nyouth!--What know I but that these evils are the messengers of Jehovah's\nwrath to the unnatural child, who thinks of a stranger's captivity\nbefore a parent's? who forgets the desolation of Judah, and looks upon\nthe comeliness of a Gentile and a stranger?--But I will tear this folly\nfrom my heart, though every fibre bleed as I rend it away!”\n\nShe wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance\nfrom the couch of the wounded knight, with her back turned towards it,\nfortifying, or endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against\nthe impending evils from without, but also against those treacherous\nfeelings which assailed her from within.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n     Approach the chamber, look upon his bed.\n     His is the passing of no peaceful ghost,\n     Which, as the lark arises to the sky,\n     'Mid morning's sweetest breeze and softest dew,\n     Is wing'd to heaven by good men's sighs and tears!--\n     Anselm parts otherwise.\n     --Old Play\n\nDuring the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the\nbesiegers, while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage,\nand the other to strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De\nBracy held brief council together in the hall of the castle.\n\n“Where is Front-de-Boeuf?” said the latter, who had superintended the\ndefence of the fortress on the other side; “men say he hath been slain.”\n\n“He lives,” said the Templar, coolly, “lives as yet; but had he worn the\nbull's head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of iron to fence\nit withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a few\nhours, and Front-de-Boeuf is with his fathers--a powerful limb lopped\noff Prince John's enterprise.”\n\n“And a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,” said De Bracy; “this\ncomes of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images of holy things\nand holy men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen.”\n\n“Go to--thou art a fool,” said the Templar; “thy superstition is upon a\nlevel with Front-de-Boeuf's want of faith; neither of you can render a\nreason for your belief or unbelief.”\n\n“Benedicite, Sir Templar,” replied De Bracy, “pray you to keep better\nrule with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By the Mother of\nHeaven, I am a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for\nthe 'bruit' goeth shrewdly out, that the most holy Order of the Temple\nof Zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert is of the number.”\n\n“Care not thou for such reports,” said the Templar; “but let us think of\nmaking good the castle.--How fought these villain yeomen on thy side?”\n\n“Like fiends incarnate,” said De Bracy. “They swarmed close up to\nthe walls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize at the\narchery, for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurse's\nboasted policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us!\nHad I not been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven\ntimes with as little remorse as if I had been a buck in season. He told\nevery rivet on my armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against\nmy ribs with as little compunction as if my bones had been of iron--But\nthat I wore a shirt of Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been\nfairly sped.”\n\n“But you maintained your post?” said the Templar. “We lost the outwork\non our part.”\n\n“That is a shrewd loss,” said De Bracy; “the knaves will find cover\nthere to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not well watched,\ngain some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and\nso break in upon us. Our numbers are too few for the defence of every\npoint, and the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but\nthey are the mark for as many arrows as a parish-butt on a holyday even.\nFront-de-Boeuf is dying too, so we shall receive no more aid from his\nbull's head and brutal strength. How think you, Sir Brian, were we\nnot better make a virtue of necessity, and compound with the rogues by\ndelivering up our prisoners?”\n\n“How?” exclaimed the Templar; “deliver up our prisoners, and stand an\nobject alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who\ndared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party\nof defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle\nagainst a vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the\nvery refuse of mankind?--Shame on thy counsel, Maurice de Bracy!--The\nruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I consent\nto such base and dishonourable composition.”\n\n“Let us to the walls, then,” said De Bracy, carelessly; “that man never\nbreathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter rate than I\ndo. But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two\nscores of my gallant troop of Free Companions?--Oh, my brave lances! if\nye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should\nI see my banner at the head of your clump of spears! And how short while\nwould these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter!”\n\n“Wish for whom thou wilt,” said the Templar, “but let us make\nwhat defence we can with the soldiers who remain--They are chiefly\nFront-de-Boeuf's followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of\ninsolence and oppression.”\n\n“The better,” said De Bracy; “the rugged slaves will defend themselves\nto the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of the\npeasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert;\nand, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice de Bracy bear himself this day\nas a gentleman of blood and lineage.”\n\n“To the walls!” answered the Templar; and they both ascended the\nbattlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish,\nin defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest\ndanger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had\npossessed themselves. The castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican\nby the moat, and it was impossible that the besiegers could assail the\npostern-door, with which the outwork corresponded, without surmounting\nthat obstacle; but it was the opinion both of the Templar and De Bracy,\nthat the besiegers, if governed by the same policy their leader had\nalready displayed, would endeavour, by a formidable assault, to draw\nthe chief part of the defenders' observation to this point, and take\nmeasures to avail themselves of every negligence which might take place\nin the defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their numbers\nonly permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along\nthe walls in communication with each other, who might give the alarm\nwhenever danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that De Bracy\nshould command the defence at the postern, and the Templar should keep\nwith him a score of men or thereabouts as a body of reserve, ready to\nhasten to any other point which might be suddenly threatened. The loss\nof the barbican had also this unfortunate effect, that, notwithstanding\nthe superior height of the castle walls, the besieged could not see from\nthem, with the same precision as before, the operations of the enemy;\nfor some straggling underwood approached so near the sallyport of the\noutwork, that the assailants might introduce into it whatever force they\nthought proper, not only under cover, but even without the knowledge of\nthe defenders. Utterly uncertain, therefore, upon what point the storm\nwas to burst, De Bracy and his companion were under the necessity of\nproviding against every possible contingency, and their followers,\nhowever brave, experienced the anxious dejection of mind incident to men\nenclosed by enemies, who possessed the power of choosing their time and\nmode of attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon\na bed of bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usual resource of\nbigots in that superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone for\nthe crimes they were guilty of by liberality to the church, stupefying\nby this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and forgiveness;\nand although the refuge which success thus purchased, was no more like\nto the peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance, than the\nturbid stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy and natural\nslumbers, it was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of\nawakened remorse. But among the vices of Front-de-Boeuf, a hard and\ngriping man, avarice was predominant; and he preferred setting church\nand churchmen at defiance, to purchasing from them pardon and absolution\nat the price of treasure and of manors. Nor did the Templar, an infidel\nof another stamp, justly characterise his associate, when he said\nFront-de-Boeuf could assign no cause for his unbelief and contempt for\nthe established faith; for the Baron would have alleged that the Church\nsold her wares too dear, that the spiritual freedom which she put up to\nsale was only to be bought like that of the chief captain of Jerusalem,\n“with a great sum,” and Front-de-Boeuf preferred denying the virtue of\nthe medicine, to paying the expense of the physician.\n\nBut the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were\ngliding from before his eyes, and when the savage Baron's heart, though\nhard as a nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into the\nwaste darkness of futurity. The fever of his body aided the impatience\nand agony of his mind, and his death-bed exhibited a mixture of\nthe newly awakened feelings of horror, combating with the fixed and\ninveterate obstinacy of his disposition;--a fearful state of mind, only\nto be equalled in those tremendous regions, where there are complaints\nwithout hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense of present\nagony, and a presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished!\n\n“Where be these dog-priests now,” growled the Baron, “who set such price\non their ghostly mummery?--where be all those unshod Carmelites, for\nwhom old Front-de-Boeuf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing his heir\nof many a fair rood of meadow, and many a fat field and close--where be\nthe greedy hounds now?--Swilling, I warrant me, at the ale, or playing\ntheir juggling tricks at the bedside of some miserly churl.--Me, the\nheir of their founder--me, whom their foundation binds them to pray\nfor--me--ungrateful villains as they are!--they suffer to die like the\nhouseless dog on yonder common, unshriven and unhouseled!--Tell the\nTemplar to come hither--he is a priest, and may do something--But\nno!--as well confess myself to the devil as to Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\nwho recks neither of heaven nor of hell.--I have heard old men talk of\nprayer--prayer by their own voice--Such need not to court or to bribe\nthe false priest--But I--I dare not!”\n\n“Lives Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,” said a broken and shrill voice close by\nhis bedside, “to say there is that which he dares not!”\n\nThe evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-Boeuf heard, in\nthis strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those\ndemons, who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the\nbeds of dying men to distract their thoughts, and turn them from the\nmeditations which concerned their eternal welfare. He shuddered and drew\nhimself together; but, instantly summoning up his wonted resolution, he\nexclaimed, “Who is there?--what art thou, that darest to echo my words\nin a tone like that of the night-raven?--Come before my couch that I may\nsee thee.”\n\n“I am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,” replied the voice.\n\n“Let me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou be'st indeed a\nfiend,” replied the dying knight; “think not that I will blench from\nthee.--By the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors\nthat hover round me, as I have done with mortal dangers, heaven or hell\nshould never say that I shrunk from the conflict!”\n\n“Think on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,” said the almost unearthly\nvoice, “on rebellion, on rapine, on murder!--Who stirred up the\nlicentious John to war against his grey-headed father--against his\ngenerous brother?”\n\n“Be thou fiend, priest, or devil,” replied Front-de-Boeuf, “thou liest\nin thy throat!--Not I stirred John to rebellion--not I alone--there were\nfifty knights and barons, the flower of the midland counties--better\nmen never laid lance in rest--And must I answer for the fault done\nby fifty?--False fiend, I defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no\nmore--let me die in peace if thou be mortal--if thou be a demon, thy\ntime is not yet come.”\n\n“In peace thou shalt NOT die,” repeated the voice; “even in death\nshalt thou think on thy murders--on the groans which this castle has\nechoed--on the blood that is engrained in its floors!”\n\n“Thou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,” answered Front-de-Boeuf,\nwith a ghastly and constrained laugh. “The infidel Jew--it was merit\nwith heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore are men canonized\nwho dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?--The Saxon porkers, whom I\nhave slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my lineage, and\nof my liege lord.--Ho! ho! thou seest there is no crevice in my coat of\nplate--Art thou fled?--art thou silenced?”\n\n“No, foul parricide!” replied the voice; “think of thy father!--think\nof his death!--think of his banquet-room flooded with his gore, and that\npoured forth by the hand of a son!”\n\n“Ha!” answered the Baron, after a long pause, “an thou knowest that,\nthou art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as the monks call\nthee!--That secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in that of one\nbesides--the temptress, the partaker of my guilt.--Go, leave me, fiend!\nand seek the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee what she\nand I alone witnessed.--Go, I say, to her, who washed the wounds, and\nstraighted the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of\none parted in time and in the course of nature--Go to her, she was my\ntemptress, the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed--let\nher, as well as I, taste of the tortures which anticipate hell!”\n\n“She already tastes them,” said Ulrica, stepping before the couch of\nFront-de-Boeuf; “she hath long drunken of this cup, and its bitterness\nis now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.--Grind not thy teeth,\nFront-de-Boeuf--roll not thine eyes--clench not thine hand, nor shake\nit at me with that gesture of menace!--The hand which, like that of thy\nrenowned ancestor who gained thy name, could have broken with one stroke\nthe skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as mine\nown!”\n\n“Vile murderous hag!” replied Front-de-Boeuf; “detestable screech-owl!\nit is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thou hast assisted\nto lay low?”\n\n“Ay, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,” answered she, “it is Ulrica!--it is the\ndaughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!--it is the sister of his\nslaughtered sons!--it is she who demands of thee, and of thy father's\nhouse, father and kindred, name and fame--all that she has lost by the\nname of Front-de-Boeuf!--Think of my wrongs, Front-de-Boeuf, and answer\nme if I speak not truth. Thou hast been my evil angel, and I will be\nthine--I will dog thee till the very instant of dissolution!”\n\n“Detestable fury!” exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, “that moment shalt thou\nnever witness--Ho! Giles, Clement, and Eustace! Saint Maur, and Stephen!\nseize this damned witch, and hurl her from the battlements headlong--she\nhas betrayed us to the Saxon!--Ho! Saint Maur! Clement! false-hearted,\nknaves, where tarry ye?”\n\n“Call on them again, valiant Baron,” said the hag, with a smile of\ngrisly mockery; “summon thy vassals around thee, doom them that loiter\nto the scourge and the dungeon--But know, mighty chief,” she continued,\nsuddenly changing her tone, “thou shalt have neither answer, nor aid,\nnor obedience at their hands.--Listen to these horrid sounds,” for the\ndin of the recommenced assault and defence now rung fearfully loud from\nthe battlements of the castle; “in that war-cry is the downfall of thy\nhouse--The blood-cemented fabric of Front-de-Boeuf's power totters\nto the foundation, and before the foes he most despised!--The Saxon,\nReginald!--the scorned Saxon assails thy walls!--Why liest thou here,\nlike a worn-out hind, when the Saxon storms thy place of strength?”\n\n“Gods and fiends!” exclaimed the wounded knight; “O, for one moment's\nstrength, to drag myself to the 'melee', and perish as becomes my name!”\n\n“Think not of it, valiant warrior!” replied she; “thou shalt die no\nsoldier's death, but perish like the fox in his den, when the peasants\nhave set fire to the cover around it.”\n\n“Hateful hag! thou liest!” exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf; “my followers bear\nthem bravely--my walls are strong and high--my comrades in arms fear\nnot a whole host of Saxons, were they headed by Hengist and Horsa!--The\nwar-cry of the Templar and of the Free Companions rises high over the\nconflict! And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon, for joy\nof our defence, it shall consume thee, body and bones; and I shall live\nto hear thou art gone from earthly fires to those of that hell, which\nnever sent forth an incarnate fiend more utterly diabolical!”\n\n“Hold thy belief,” replied Ulrica, “till the proof reach thee--But, no!”\n she said, interrupting herself, “thou shalt know, even now, the doom,\nwhich all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable to avoid,\nthough it is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thou the\nsmouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds\nthrough the chamber?--Didst thou think it was but the darkening of\nthy bursting eyes--the difficulty of thy cumbered breathing?--No!\nFront-de-Boeuf, there is another cause--Rememberest thou the magazine of\nfuel that is stored beneath these apartments?”\n\n“Woman!” he exclaimed with fury, “thou hast not set fire to it?--By\nheaven, thou hast, and the castle is in flames!”\n\n“They are fast rising at least,” said Ulrica, with frightful composure;\n“and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon\nthose who would extinguish them.--Farewell, Front-de-Boeuf!--May Mista,\nSkogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient Saxons--fiends, as the\npriests now call them--supply the place of comforters at your dying bed,\nwhich Ulrica now relinquishes!--But know, if it will give thee comfort\nto know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with thyself,\nthe companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guilt.--And now,\nparricide, farewell for ever!--May each stone of this vaulted roof find\na tongue to echo that title into thine ear!”\n\nSo saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-Boeuf could hear the\ncrash of the ponderous key, as she locked and double-locked the door\nbehind her, thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the\nextremity of agony he shouted upon his servants and allies--“Stephen and\nSaint Maur!--Clement and Giles!--I burn here unaided!--To the rescue--to\nthe rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert, valiant De Bracy!--It is Front-de-Boeuf\nwho calls!--It is your master, ye traitor squires!--Your ally--your\nbrother in arms, ye perjured and faithless knights!--all the curses due\nto traitors upon your recreant heads, do you abandon me to perish thus\nmiserably!--They hear me not--they cannot hear me--my voice is lost in\nthe din of battle.--The smoke rolls thicker and thicker--the fire has\ncaught upon the floor below--O, for one drought of the air of heaven,\nwere it to be purchased by instant annihilation!” And in the mad frenzy\nof despair, the wretch now shouted with the shouts of the fighters, now\nmuttered curses on himself, on mankind, and on Heaven itself.--“The red\nfire flashes through the thick smoke!” he exclaimed; “the demon marches\nagainst me under the banner of his own element--Foul spirit, avoid!--I\ngo not with thee without my comrades--all, all are thine, that garrison\nthese walls--Thinkest thou Front-de-Boeuf will be singled out to go\nalone?--No--the infidel Templar--the licentious De Bracy--Ulrica, the\nfoul murdering strumpet--the men who aided my enterprises--the dog\nSaxons and accursed Jews, who are my prisoners--all, all shall attend\nme--a goodly fellowship as ever took the downward road--Ha, ha, ha!” and\nhe laughed in his frenzy till the vaulted roof rang again. “Who laughed\nthere?” exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, in altered mood, for the noise of\nthe conflict did not prevent the echoes of his own mad laughter\nfrom returning upon his ear--“who laughed there?--Ulrica, was it\nthou?--Speak, witch, and I forgive thee--for, only thou or the fiend of\nhell himself could have laughed at such a moment. Avaunt--avaunt!---”\n\nBut it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer\nand parricide's deathbed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n     Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,\n     Or, close the wall up with our English dead.\n     -------And you, good yeomen,\n     Whose limbs were made in England, show us here\n     The mettle of your pasture--let us swear\n     That you are worth your breeding.\n     King Henry V\n\nCedric, although not greatly confident in Ulrica's message, omitted not\nto communicate her promise to the Black Knight and Locksley. They were\nwell pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in\nthe moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily\nagreed with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought\nto be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in\nthe hands of the cruel Front-de-Boeuf.\n\n“The royal blood of Alfred is endangered,” said Cedric.\n\n“The honour of a noble lady is in peril,” said the Black Knight.\n\n“And, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,” said the good yeoman,\n“were there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave,\nWamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.”\n\n“And so would I,” said the Friar; “what, sirs! I trust well that a\nfool--I mean, d'ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild and\nmaster of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of\nwine as ever a flitch of bacon can--I say, brethren, such a fool shall\nnever want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait, while\nI can say a mass or flourish a partisan.” And with that he made his\nheavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his\nlight crook.\n\n“True, Holy Clerk,” said the Black Knight, “true as if Saint Dunstan\nhimself had said it.--And now, good Locksley, were it not well that\nnoble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?”\n\n“Not a jot I,” returned Cedric; “I have never been wont to study either\nhow to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which\nthe Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the\nforemost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier\nin the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.”\n\n“Since it stands thus with noble Cedric,” said Locksley, “I am most\nwilling to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang\nme up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show\nthemselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as\nthere are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.”\n\n“Well said, stout yeoman,” answered the Black Knight; “and if I be\nthought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among\nthese brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight,\nfor so I may surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my\nexperience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.”\n\nThe parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the\nfirst assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.\n\nWhen the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the\nhappy event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such\na strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from\ncombining their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork\nwhich they had lost. This the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding,\nconscious that the men whom he led, being hasty and untrained\nvolunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon\nany sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers\nof the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both defensive\nand offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of the\nbesiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline\nand the habitual use of weapons.\n\nThe knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of\nfloating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the\nmoat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some\ntime, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure to\nexecute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.\n\nWhen the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the\nbesiegers:--“It avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is\ndescending to the west--and I have that upon my hands which will not\npermit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel if\nthe horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish\nour purpose. Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid him commence a\ndischarge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward\nas if about to assault it; and you, true English hearts, stand by me,\nand be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the\npostern on our side is thrown open. Follow me boldly across, and aid me\nto burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle. As many of you as\nlike not this service, or are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the\ntop of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to your ears, and mind you\nquell with your shot whatever shall appear to man the rampart--Noble\nCedric, wilt thou take the direction of those which remain?”\n\n“Not so, by the soul of Hereward!” said the Saxon; “lead I cannot; but\nmay posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the foremost\nwherever thou shalt point the way--The quarrel is mine, and well it\nbecomes me to be in the van of the battle.”\n\n“Yet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,” said the knight, “thou hast neither\nhauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and\nsword.”\n\n“The better!” answered Cedric; “I shall be the lighter to climb these\nwalls. And,--forgive the boast, Sir Knight,--thou shalt this day see\nthe naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye\nbeheld the steel corslet of a Norman.”\n\n“In the name of God, then,” said the knight, “fling open the door, and\nlaunch the floating bridge.”\n\nThe portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat,\nand which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle,\nwas now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward,\nand soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle\nand outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men\nabreast to cross the moat. Well aware of the importance of taking the\nfoe by surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw\nhimself upon the bridge, and reached the opposite side. Here he began to\nthunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from\nthe shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former\ndrawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat from the\nbarbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of\nthe portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two were\ninstantly shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the moat;\nthe others retreated back into the barbican.\n\nThe situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous,\nand would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the\narchers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon\nthe battlements, distracting the attention of those by whom they were\nmanned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the\nstorm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them. But their\nsituation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every\nmoment.\n\n“Shame on ye all!” cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; “do ye\ncall yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station\nunder the walls of the castle?--Heave over the coping stones from the\nbattlements, an better may not be--Get pick-axe and levers, and down\nwith that huge pinnacle!” pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work\nthat projected from the parapet.\n\nAt this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle\nof the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout yeoman\nLocksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the\noutwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.\n\n“Saint George!” he cried, “Merry Saint George for England!--To the\ncharge, bold yeomen!--why leave ye the good knight and noble Cedric to\nstorm the pass alone?--make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for\nthy rosary,--make in, brave yeomen!--the castle is ours, we have friends\nwithin--See yonder flag, it is the appointed signal--Torquilstone is\nours!--Think of honour, think of spoil--One effort, and the place is\nours!”\n\nWith that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the\nbreast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy's direction, was\nloosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the\nheads of Cedric and the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the\nhands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and\nhad loosened the stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his\nhead-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man.\nThe men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the\nshot of this tremendous archer.\n\n“Do you give ground, base knaves!” said De Bracy; “'Mount joye Saint\nDennis!'--Give me the lever!”\n\nAnd, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was\nof weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant\nof the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also\nto have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. All\nsaw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided\nsetting foot on the raft. Thrice did Locksley bend his shaft against De\nBracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knight's armour of\nproof.\n\n“Curse on thy Spanish steel-coat!” said Locksley, “had English smith\nforged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or\nsendal.” He then began to call out, “Comrades! friends! noble Cedric!\nbear back, and let the ruin fall.”\n\nHis warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself\noccasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty\nwar-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked\nbridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him.\nBut his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already\ntottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have\naccomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his\nears:--\n\n“All is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.”\n\n“Thou art mad to say so!” replied the knight.\n\n“It is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain\nto extinguish it.”\n\nWith the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not\nso calmly received by his astonished comrade.\n\n“Saints of Paradise!” said De Bracy; “what is to be done? I vow to Saint\nNicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold--”\n\n“Spare thy vow,” said the Templar, “and mark me. Lead thy men down, as\nif to a sally; throw the postern-gate open--There are but two men who\noccupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the\nbarbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on\nthe outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend\nourselves until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair\nquarter.”\n\n“It is well thought upon,” said De Bracy; “I will play my part--Templar,\nthou wilt not fail me?”\n\n“Hand and glove, I will not!” said Bois-Guilbert. “But haste thee, in\nthe name of God!”\n\nDe Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the\npostern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce\nwas this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his\nway inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost\ninstantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leader's\nefforts to stop them.\n\n“Dogs!” said De Bracy, “will ye let TWO men win our only pass for\nsafety?”\n\n“He is the devil!” said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the\nblows of their sable antagonist.\n\n“And if he be the devil,” replied De Bracy, “would you fly from him into\nthe mouth of hell?--the castle burns behind us, villains!--let despair\ngive you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this champion\nmyself.”\n\nAnd well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had\nacquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage\nto which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted\nchampions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows\nwhich they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight\nwith his ponderous axe. At length the Norman received a blow, which,\nthough its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never\nmore would De Bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such\nviolence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.\n\n“Yield thee, De Bracy,” said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and\nholding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the\nknights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of\nmercy,)--“yield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou art\nbut a dead man.”\n\n“I will not yield,” replied De Bracy faintly, “to an unknown conqueror.\nTell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me--it shall never be said\nthat Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.”\n\nThe Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.\n\n“I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,” answered the\nNorman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of\ndeep though sullen submission.\n\n“Go to the barbican,” said the victor, in a tone of authority, “and\nthere wait my further orders.”\n\n“Yet first, let me say,” said De Bracy, “what it imports thee to know.\nWilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the\nburning castle without present help.”\n\n“Wilfred of Ivanhoe!” exclaimed the Black Knight--“prisoner, and\nperish!--The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair\nof his head be singed--Show me his chamber!”\n\n“Ascend yonder winding stair,” said De Bracy; “it leads to his\napartment--Wilt thou not accept my guidance?” he added, in a submissive\nvoice.\n\n“No. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De\nBracy.”\n\nDuring this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at\nthe head of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had\npushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove\nback the dispirited and despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom some\nasked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled\ntowards the court-yard. De Bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast\na sorrowful glance after his conqueror. “He trusts me not!” he repeated;\n“but have I deserved his trust?” He then lifted his sword from the\nfloor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the\nbarbican, gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way.\n\nAs the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the\nchamber, where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He\nhad been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and\nhis attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at\nthe window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was\nfor some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the\nsmouldering and stifling vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which\nrolled into the apartment--the cries for water, which were heard even\nabove the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this\nnew danger.\n\n“The castle burns,” said Rebecca; “it burns!--What can we do to save\nourselves?”\n\n“Fly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,” said Ivanhoe, “for no human aid\ncan avail me.”\n\n“I will not fly,” answered Rebecca; “we will be saved or perish\ntogether--And yet, great God!--my father, my father--what will be his\nfate!”\n\nAt this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar\npresented himself,--a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken\nand bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his\ncasque. “I have found thee,” said he to Rebecca; “thou shalt prove I\nwill keep my word to share weal and woe with thee--There is but one\npath to safety, I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to\nthee--up, and instantly follow me!” [38]\n\n“Alone,” answered Rebecca, “I will not follow thee. If thou wert born of\nwoman--if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee--if thy heart\nbe not hard as thy breastplate--save my aged father--save this wounded\nknight!”\n\n“A knight,” answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, “a\nknight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the\nshape of sword or flame--and who recks how or where a Jew meets with\nhis?”\n\n“Savage warrior,” said Rebecca, “rather will I perish in the flames than\naccept safety from thee!”\n\n“Thou shalt not choose, Rebecca--once didst thou foil me, but never\nmortal did so twice.”\n\nSo saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with\nher shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her\ncries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe\nthundered against him. “Hound of the Temple--stain to thine Order--set\nfree the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands\nthee!--Villain, I will have thy heart's blood!”\n\n“I had not found thee, Wilfred,” said the Black Knight, who at that\ninstant entered the apartment, “but for thy shouts.”\n\n“If thou be'st true knight,” said Wilfred, “think not of me--pursue yon\nravisher--save the Lady Rowena--look to the noble Cedric!”\n\n“In their turn,” answered he of the Fetterlock, “but thine is first.”\n\nAnd seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the\nTemplar had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and\nhaving there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again\nentered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.\n\nOne turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from\nwindow and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the\nwalls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress\nof the flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce\nmore dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued\nthe defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in\ntheir blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the\nsoldiers of the tyrant Front-de-Boeuf. Most of the garrison resisted to\nthe uttermost--few of them asked quarter--none received it. The air was\nfilled with groans and clashing of arms--the floors were slippery with\nthe blood of despairing and expiring wretches.\n\nThrough this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while\nthe faithful Gurth, following him closely through the “melee”, neglected\nhis own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at\nhis master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward's\napartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a\ncrucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant\ndeath. He committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in\nsafety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy,\nand not yet interrupted by the flames. This accomplished, the loyal\nCedric hastened in quest of his friend Athelstane, determined, at every\nrisk to himself, to save that last scion of Saxon royalty. But ere\nCedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been\na prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had procured liberation for\nhimself and his companion in adversity.\n\nWhen the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the\nJester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, “Saint George\nand the dragon!--Bonny Saint George for merry England!--The castle is\nwon!” And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging against\neach other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered\naround the hall.\n\nA guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and\nwhose spirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wamba's\nclamour, and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar\nthat foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners found no\ndifficulty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from thence\ninto the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of contest.\nHere sat the fierce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded by several\nof the garrison both on horse and foot, who had united their strength\nto that of this renowned leader, in order to secure the last chance\nof safety and retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge had been\nlowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who\nhad hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles, no\nsooner saw the flames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they\nthronged to the entrance, as well to prevent the escape of the garrison,\nas to secure their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt\ndown. On the other hand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by\nthe postern were now issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with\nfury the remnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides\nat once.\n\nAnimated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their\nindomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with\nthe utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in\ndriving back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca,\nplaced on horseback before one of the Templar's Saracen slaves, was in\nthe midst of the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the\nconfusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety.\nRepeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held\nbefore her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon\nstarting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward,\nstruck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same\ninstant once more at her bridle rein.\n\nAthelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,\nbeheld the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and\ndoubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in\ndespite of all resistance which could be offered.\n\n“By the soul of Saint Edward,” he said, “I will rescue her from yonder\nover-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!”\n\n“Think what you do!” cried Wamba; “hasty hand catches frog for fish--by\nmy bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena--see but her long dark\nlocks!--Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but\nI will be no follower--no bones of mine shall be broken unless I know\nfor whom.--And you without armour too!--Bethink you, silk bonnet never\nkept out steel blade.--Nay, then, if wilful will to water, wilful must\ndrench.--'Deus vobiscum', most doughty Athelstane!”--he concluded,\nloosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the Saxon's tunic.\n\nTo snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose\ndying grasp had just relinquished it--to rush on the Templar's band, and\nto strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior\nat each blow, was, for Athelstane's great strength, now animated with\nunusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two\nyards of Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest tone.\n\n“Turn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to\ntouch--turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!”\n\n“Dog!” said the Templar, grinding his teeth, “I will teach thee to\nblaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;” and with these words,\nhalf-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and\nrising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of\nthe horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.\n\nWell said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So\ntrenchant was the Templar's weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had\nbeen a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the\nill-fated Saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head,\nlevelled him with the earth.\n\n“'Ha! Beau-seant!'” exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, “thus be it to the\nmaligners of the Temple-knights!” Taking advantage of the dismay which\nwas spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, “Those who\nwould save themselves, follow me!” he pushed across the drawbridge,\ndispersing the archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed\nby his Saracens, and some five or six men-at-arms, who had mounted their\nhorses. The Templar's retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of\narrows shot off at him and his party; but this did not prevent him from\ngalloping round to the barbican, of which, according to his previous\nplan, he supposed it possible De Bracy might have been in possession.\n\n“De Bracy! De Bracy!” he shouted, “art thou there?”\n\n“I am here,” replied De Bracy, “but I am a prisoner.”\n\n“Can I rescue thee?” cried Bois-Guilbert.\n\n“No,” replied De Bracy; “I have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I will\nbe true prisoner. Save thyself--there are hawks abroad--put the seas\nbetwixt you and England--I dare not say more.”\n\n“Well,” answered the Templar, “an thou wilt tarry there, remember I\nhave redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks\nthe walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient, and\nthither will I, like heron to her haunt.”\n\nHaving thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.\n\nThose of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued\nto fight desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the\nTemplar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any\nhope of escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the\ncastle, when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in\nthe guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such\nas was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the\nyet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her\nuncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended\nin her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff\nwhich she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal Sisters,\nwho spin and abridge the thread of human life. Tradition has preserved\nsome wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid\nthat scene of fire and of slaughter:--\n\n     1.\n     Whet the bright steel,\n     Sons of the White Dragon!\n     Kindle the torch,\n     Daughter of Hengist!\n     The steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet,\n     It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed;\n     The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber,\n     It steams and glitters blue with sulphur.\n     Whet the steel, the raven croaks!\n     Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling!\n     Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon!\n     Kindle the torch, daughter of Hengist!\n\n     2.\n     The black cloud is low over the thane's castle\n     The eagle screams--he rides on its bosom.\n     Scream not, grey rider of the sable cloud,\n     Thy banquet is prepared!\n     The maidens of Valhalla look forth,\n     The race of Hengist will send them guests.\n     Shake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla!\n     And strike your loud timbrels for joy!\n     Many a haughty step bends to your halls,\n     Many a helmed head.\n\n     3.\n     Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,\n     The black clouds gather round;\n     Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!\n     The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against\n     them.\n     He, the bright consumer of palaces,\n     Broad waves he his blazing banner,\n     Red, wide and dusky,\n     Over the strife of the valiant:\n     His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;\n     He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the\n     wound!\n\n     4.\n     All must perish!\n     The sword cleaveth the helmet;\n     The strong armour is pierced by the lance;\n     Fire devoureth the dwelling of princes,\n     Engines break down the fences of the battle.\n     All must perish!\n     The race of Hengist is gone--\n     The name of Horsa is no more!\n     Shrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword!\n     Let your blades drink blood like wine;\n     Feast ye in the banquet of slaughter,\n     By the light of the blazing halls!\n     Strong be your swords while your blood is warm,\n     And spare neither for pity nor fear,\n     For vengeance hath but an hour;\n     Strong hate itself shall expire\n     I also must perish! [39]\n\nThe towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to\nthe evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through\nthe adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof\nand rafter; and the combatants were driven from the court-yard. The\nvanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the\nneighbouring wood. The victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with\nwonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in which their own ranks\nand arms glanced dusky red. The maniac figure of the Saxon Ulrica was\nfor a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing\nher arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the\nconflagration which she had raised. At length, with a terrific crash,\nthe whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had\nconsumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of\nthe armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not\na finger, save to sign the cross. The voice of Locksley was then heard,\n“Shout, yeomen!--the den of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his\nspoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the Trysting-tree in the\nHarthill-walk; for there at break of day will we make just partition\namong our own bands, together with our worthy allies in this great deed\nof vengeance.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n     Trust me each state must have its policies:\n     Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;\n     Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,\n     Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline;\n     For not since Adam wore his verdant apron,\n     Hath man with man in social union dwelt,\n     But laws were made to draw that union closer.\n     --Old Play\n\nThe daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green\nboughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn\nfrom the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood,\nand no huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he\npaced at the head of the antler'd herd.\n\nThe outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the\nHarthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves\nafter the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many\nwith hearing and recounting the events of the day, and computing the\nheaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their\nChief.\n\nThe spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was\nconsumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,\nhad been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be\nappalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. Yet so strict were\nthe laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any\npart of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the\ndisposal of their leader.\n\nThe place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which\nLocksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the story,\nbut one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a\nmile of the demolished castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley assumed his\nseat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge\noak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. He assigned to\nthe Black Knight a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a place upon\nhis left.\n\n“Pardon my freedom, noble sirs,” he said, “but in these glades I am\nmonarch--they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck but\nlittle of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to\nmortal man.--Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our curtal\nFriar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.”--No one\nhad seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. “Over gods forbode!” said the outlaw\nchief, “I trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a\nthought too late. Who saw him since the castle was ta'en?”\n\n“I,” quoth the Miller, “marked him busy about the door of a cellar,\nswearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of\nFront-de-Boeuf's Gascoigne wine.”\n\n“Now, the saints, as many as there be of them,” said the Captain,\n“forefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished by\nthe fall of the castle!--Away, Miller!--take with you enow of men,\nseek the place where you last saw him--throw water from the moat on the\nscorching ruins--I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my\ncurtal Friar.”\n\nThe numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an\ninteresting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much\nthe troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.\n\n“Meanwhile, let us proceed,” said Locksley; “for when this bold deed\nshall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and other\nallies of Front-de-Boeuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well\nfor our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.--Noble Cedric,” he\nsaid, turning to the Saxon, “that spoil is divided into two portions; do\nthou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people\nwho were partakers with us in this adventure.”\n\n“Good yeoman,” said Cedric, “my heart is oppressed with sadness. The\nnoble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more--the last sprout of\nthe sainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never\nreturn!--A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human\nbreath can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me,\ndo but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last\nmansion. The Lady Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must\nbe escorted by a sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now, have\nleft this place; and I waited--not to share the booty, for, so help me\nGod and Saint Withold! as neither I nor any of mine will touch the value\nof a liard,--I waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold\nyeomen, for the life and honour ye have saved.”\n\n“Nay, but,” said the chief Outlaw, “we did but half the work at\nmost--take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and\nfollowers.”\n\n“I am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,” answered Cedric.\n\n“And some,” said Wamba, “have been wise enough to reward themselves;\nthey do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear\nmotley.”\n\n“They are welcome,” said Locksley; “our laws bind none but ourselves.”\n\n“But, thou, my poor knave,” said Cedric, turning about and embracing\nhis Jester, “how shall I reward thee, who feared not to give thy body\nto chains and death instead of mine!--All forsook me, when the poor fool\nwas faithful!”\n\nA tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke--a mark of\nfeeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there\nwas something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that\nwaked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.\n\n“Nay,” said the Jester, extricating himself from master's caress, “if\nyou pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester must weep\nfor company, and then what becomes of his vocation?--But, uncle, if you\nwould indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who\nstole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.”\n\n“Pardon him!” exclaimed Cedric; “I will both pardon and reward\nhim.--Kneel down, Gurth.”--The swineherd was in an instant at his\nmaster's feet--“THEOW and ESNE [40] art thou no longer,” said Cedric\ntouching him with a wand; “FOLKFREE and SACLESS [41] art thou in town\nand from town, in the forest as in the field. A hide of land I give to\nthee in my steads of Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee and thine aye\nand for ever; and God's malison on his head who this gainsays!”\n\nNo longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his\nfeet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground.\n“A smith and a file,” he cried, “to do away the collar from the neck\nof a freeman!--Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and\ndoubly will I fight for you!--There is a free spirit in my breast--I am\na man changed to myself and all around.--Ha, Fangs!” he continued,--for\nthat faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump\nupon him, to express his sympathy,--“knowest thou thy master still?”\n\n“Ay,” said Wamba, “Fangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must\nneeds abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us\nand thyself.”\n\n“I shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,” said\nGurth; “and were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not let\nthee want it.”\n\n“Nay,” said Wamba, “never think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf\nsits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of\nbattle--And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury--Better a fool at a feast\nthan a wise man at a fray.”\n\nThe tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared,\nsurrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who\njoyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her\nfreedom. She herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut\npalfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an\nunwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. Her\nlovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope\nfor the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past\ndeliverance--She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that\nAthelstane was dead. The former assurance filled her with the most\nsincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter,\nshe might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed\nfrom further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been\ncontradicted by her guardian Cedric.\n\nAs Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley's seat, that bold yeoman, with\nall his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of\ncourtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand,\nand bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an\ninstant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in\nfew but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to Locksley and her\nother deliverers.--“God bless you, brave men,” she concluded, “God and\nOur Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling yourselves\nin the cause of the oppressed!--If any of you should hunger, remember\nRowena has food--if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and\nbrown ale--and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena has\nforests of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full\nfreedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.”\n\n“Thanks, gentle lady,” said Locksley; “thanks from my company and\nmyself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the\ngreenwood do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena's deliverance may be\nreceived as an atonement.”\n\nAgain bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a\nmoment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,\nshe found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood\nunder a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast,\nand Rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up,\nhowever, and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame suffused\nhis handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute; then,\nstepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before\nher.\n\n“Will the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye--on a captive knight--on a\ndishonoured soldier?”\n\n“Sir Knight,” answered Rowena, “in enterprises such as yours, the real\ndishonour lies not in failure, but in success.”\n\n“Conquest, lady, should soften the heart,” answered De Bracy; “let me\nbut know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an\nill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to\nserve her in nobler ways.”\n\n“I forgive you, Sir Knight,” said Rowena, “as a Christian.”\n\n“That means,” said Wamba, “that she does not forgive him at all.”\n\n“But I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has\noccasioned,” continued Rowena.\n\n“Unloose your hold on the lady's rein,” said Cedric, coming up. “By the\nbright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to the earth\nwith my javelin--but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de\nBracy, for thy share in this foul deed.”\n\n“He threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,” said De Bracy; “but when\nhad a Saxon any touch of courtesy?”\n\nThen retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.\n\nCedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black\nChampion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to Rotherwood.\n\n“I know,” he said, “that ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes\non the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but war is\na changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the\nchampion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the halls\nof Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the\ninjuries of fortune, and all he has is his deliverer's--Come, therefore,\nto Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.”\n\n“Cedric has already made me rich,” said the Knight,--“he has taught me\nthe value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave Saxon, and\nthat speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from\nyour halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as\nwill put even thy generosity to the test.”\n\n“It is granted ere spoken out,” said Cedric, striking his ready hand\ninto the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,--“it is granted already,\nwere it to affect half my fortune.”\n\n“Gage not thy promise so lightly,” said the Knight of the Fetterlock;\n“yet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile, adieu.”\n\n“I have but to say,” added the Saxon, “that, during the funeral rites\nof the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his\ncastle of Coningsburgh--They will be open to all who choose to partake\nof the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith,\nmother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who\nlaboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from\nNorman chains and Norman steel.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master,\n“rare feeding there will be--pity that the noble Athelstane cannot\nbanquet at his own funeral.--But he,” continued the Jester, lifting up\nhis eyes gravely, “is supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour to\nthe cheer.”\n\n“Peace, and move on,” said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being\nchecked by the recollection of Wamba's recent services. Rowena waved a\ngraceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock--the Saxon bade God speed him,\nand on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.\n\nThey had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the\ngreenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and\ntook the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of\na neighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or\n“soul-scat”, which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which\nthe body of Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly\nand slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of\nConingsburgh, to be there deposited in the grave of Hengist, from whom\nthe deceased derived his long descent. Many of his vassals had assembled\nat the news of his death, and followed the bier with all the external\nmarks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws arose, and\npaid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which they had\nso lately rendered to beauty--the slow chant and mournful step of the\npriests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had\nfallen in the yesterday's array. But such recollections dwell not long\nwith those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound\nof the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in\nthe distribution of their spoil.\n\n“Valiant knight,” said Locksley to the Black Champion, “without whose\ngood heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed,\nwill it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best\nserve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?”\n\n“I accept the offer,” said the Knight, “as frankly as it is given; and I\nask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own pleasure.”\n\n“He is thine already,” said Locksley, “and well for him! else the\ntyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his\nFree-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around\nhim.--But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my\nfather.”\n\n“De Bracy,” said the Knight, “thou art free--depart. He whose prisoner\nthou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But beware of\nthe future, lest a worse thing befall thee.--Maurice de Bracy, I say\nBEWARE!”\n\nDe Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the\nyeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud\nknight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form\nto its full height, and exclaimed, “Peace, ye yelping curs! who open\nupon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay--De Bracy\nscorns your censure as he would disdain your applause. To your brakes\nand caves, ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or\nnoble is but spoken within a league of your fox-earths.”\n\nThis ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of\narrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw\nChief. Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several\nwhich had been taken in the stables of Front-de-Boeuf stood accoutred\naround, and were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon the\nsaddle, and galloped off through the wood.\n\nWhen the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the\nchief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had\nrecently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.\n\n“Noble knight.” he said to him of the Fetterlock, “if you disdain not to\ngrace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has once worn,\nthis I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearing--and\nif ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant knight, ye\nchance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind\nthree mots [42] upon the horn thus, 'Wa-sa-hoa!' and it may well chance\nye shall find helpers and rescue.”\n\nHe then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call\nwhich he described, until the knight had caught the notes.\n\n“Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,” said the Knight; “and better help\nthan thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost\nneed.” And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood\nrang.\n\n“Well blown and clearly,” said the yeoman; “beshrew me an thou knowest\nnot as much of woodcraft as of war!--thou hast been a striker of deer in\nthy day, I warrant.--Comrades, mark these three mots--it is the call of\nthe Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens not to\nserve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with his\nown bowstring.”\n\n“Long live our leader!” shouted the yeomen, “and long live the Black\nKnight of the Fetterlock!--May he soon use our service, to prove how\nreadily it will be paid.”\n\nLocksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he\nperformed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the whole\nwas set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next\nallotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows\nand children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for\nthe souls of such as had left no surviving family. The rest was divided\namongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment\nof the Chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred, was delivered\nwith great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. The\nBlack Knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a state so\nlawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably\ngoverned, and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice\nand judgment of their leader.\n\nWhen each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the\ntreasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that\nbelonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the\nportion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.\n\n“I would,” said the leader, “we could hear tidings of our joyous\nchaplain--he was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed, or\nspoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes\nof our successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover\nsome of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his\na prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to help\nme to deal with him in due sort--I greatly misdoubt the safety of the\nbluff priest.”\n\n“I were right sorry for that,” said the Knight of the Fetterlock, “for I\nstand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in his\ncell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn\nsome tidings of him.”\n\nWhile they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the\narrival of him for whom they feared, as they learned from the stentorian\nvoice of the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.\n\n“Make room, my merry-men!” he exclaimed; “room for your godly father\nand his prisoner--Cry welcome once more.--I come, noble leader, like an\neagle with my prey in my clutch.”--And making his way through the ring,\namidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph, his\nhuge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which\nwas fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent\ndown by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who\nshouted aloud, “Where is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or\nif it were but a lay?--By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever\nout of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!”\n\n“Curtal Priest,” said the Captain, “thou hast been at a wet mass this\nmorning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast\nthou got here?”\n\n“A captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,” replied the\nClerk of Copmanhurst; “to my bow and to my halberd, I should rather\nsay; and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity.\nSpeak, Jew--have I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?--have I not taught\nthee thy 'credo', thy 'pater', and thine 'Ave Maria'?--Did I not spend\nthe whole night in drinking to thee, and in expounding of mysteries?”\n\n“For the love of God!” ejaculated the poor Jew, “will no one take me out\nof the keeping of this mad--I mean this holy man?”\n\n“How's this, Jew?” said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; “dost thou\nrecant, Jew?--Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thine infidelity,\nthough thou are not so tender as a suckling pig--I would I had one\nto break my fast upon--thou art not too tough to be roasted! Be\nconformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. 'Ave Maria'!--”\n\n“Nay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,” said Locksley; “let us\nrather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.”\n\n“By Saint Dunstan,” said the Friar, “I found him where I sought for\nbetter ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued\nthere; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an evening's\ndrought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so much good\nliquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and\nwas coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to\nseek when a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong\ndoor--Aha! thought I, here is the choicest juice of all in this secret\ncrypt; and the knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left\nthe key in the door--In therefore I went, and found just nought besides\na commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently\nrendered himself my prisoner, rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh\nmyself after the fatigue of the action, with the unbeliever, with one\nhumming cup of sack, and was proceeding to lead forth my captive,\nwhen, crash after crash, as with wild thunder-dint and levin-fire, down\ntoppled the masonry of an outer tower, (marry beshrew their hands that\nbuilt it not the firmer!) and blocked up the passage. The roar of one\nfalling tower followed another--I gave up thought of life; and deeming\nit a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in\ncompany with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but\nI took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down the\npartisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And truly,\nby the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been sown in good soil;\nonly that, with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole night,\nand being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughts of sack which I\nsharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is well-nigh\ndizzied, I trow.--But I was clean exhausted.--Gilbert and Wibbald know\nin what state they found me--quite and clean exhausted.”\n\n“We can bear witness,” said Gilbert; “for when we had cleared away the\nruin, and by Saint Dunstan's help lighted upon the dungeon stair, we\nfound the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar\nmore than half--exhausted, as he calls it.”\n\n“Ye be knaves! ye lie!” retorted the offended Friar; “it was you and\nyour gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your\nmorning draught--I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain's own\nthroat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I\nhave told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.”\n\n“Jew,” said the Captain, “is this true? hast thou renounced thine\nunbelief?”\n\n“May I so find mercy in your eyes,” said the Jew, “as I know not one\nword which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night.\nAlas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had\nour holy father Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf\nlistener.”\n\n“Thou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.” said the Friar; “I will\nremind thee of but one word of our conference--thou didst promise to\ngive all thy substance to our holy Order.”\n\n“So help me the Promise, fair sirs,” said Isaac, even more alarmed than\nbefore, “as no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged\nbeggar'd man--I fear me a childless--have ruth on me, and let me go!”\n\n“Nay,” said the Friar, “if thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy\nChurch, thou must do penance.”\n\nAccordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of\nit lustily on the Jew's shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the\nblow, and thereby transferred the Holy Clerk's resentment to himself.\n\n“By Saint Thomas of Kent,” said he, “an I buckle to my gear, I will\nteach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre thine\niron case there!”\n\n“Nay, be not wroth with me,” said the Knight; “thou knowest I am thy\nsworn friend and comrade.”\n\n“I know no such thing,” answered the Friar; “and defy thee for a\nmeddling coxcomb!”\n\n“Nay, but,” said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking\nhis quondam host, “hast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for I say\nnothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break\nthy vow of fast and vigil?”\n\n“Truly, friend,” said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, “I will bestow\na buffet on thee.”\n\n“I accept of no such presents,” said the Knight; “I am content to take\nthy cuff [421] as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner\nthere exacted in his traffic.”\n\n“I will prove that presently,” said the Friar.\n\n“Hola!” cried the Captain, “what art thou after, mad Friar? brawling\nbeneath our Trysting-tree?”\n\n“No brawling,” said the Knight, “it is but a friendly interchange of\ncourtesy.--Friar, strike an thou darest--I will stand thy blow, if thou\nwilt stand mine.”\n\n“Thou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,” said the\nchurchman; “but have at thee--Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath of\nGath in his brazen helmet.”\n\nThe Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full\nstrength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled an\nox. But his adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by\nall the yeomen around; for the Clerk's cuff was proverbial amongst them,\nand there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to\nknow its vigour.\n\n“Now, Priest,” said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, “if I had\nvantage on my head, I will have none on my hand--stand fast as a true\nman.”\n\n“'Genam meam dedi vapulatori'--I have given my cheek to the smiter,”\n said the Priest; “an thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow, I will\nfreely bestow on thee the Jew's ransom.”\n\nSo spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But\nwho may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such\nstrength and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon\nthe plain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. But he arose\nneither angry nor crestfallen.\n\n“Brother,” said he to the Knight, “thou shouldst have used thy strength\nwith more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst\nbroken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops.\nNevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will\nexchange no more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End\nnow all unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard will\nnot change his spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.”\n\n“The Priest,” said Clement, “is not half so confident of the Jew's\nconversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.”\n\n“Go to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?--what, is there no\nrespect?--all masters and no men?--I tell thee, fellow, I was somewhat\ntotty when I received the good knight's blow, or I had kept my ground\nunder it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can give as\nwell as take.”\n\n“Peace all!” said the Captain. “And thou, Jew, think of thy ransom;\nthou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in all\nChristian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence\namong us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a prisoner of\nanother cast.”\n\n“Were many of Front-de-Boeuf's men taken?” demanded the Black Knight.\n\n“None of note enough to be put to ransom,” answered the Captain; “a\nset of hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a new\nmaster--enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them\nwere not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty--a\njolly monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear\nand wearing apparel.--Here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a\npyet.” And, between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of\nthe outlaw Chief, our old friend, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n     ---Flower of warriors,\n     How is't with Titus Lartius?\n     MARCIUS.--As with a man busied about decrees,\n     Condemning some to death and some to exile,\n     Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other.\n     --Coriolanus\n\n\nThe captive Abbot's features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture\nof offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.\n\n“Why, how now, my masters?” said he, with a voice in which all three\nemotions were blended. “What order is this among ye? Be ye Turks\nor Christians, that handle a churchman?--Know ye what it is, 'manus\nimponere in servos Domini'? Ye have plundered my mails--torn my cope\nof curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!--Another in my\nplace would have been at his 'excommunicabo vos'; but I am placible,\nand if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore\nmy mails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in\nmasses at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no\nvenison until next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of\nthis mad frolic.”\n\n“Holy Father,” said the chief Outlaw, “it grieves me to think that you\nhave met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your\nfatherly reprehension.”\n\n“Usage!” echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan\nleader; “it were usage fit for no hound of good race--much less for a\nChristian--far less for a priest--and least of all for the Prior of\nthe holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken minstrel,\ncalled Allan-a-Dale--'nebulo quidam'--who has menaced me with corporal\npunishment--nay, with death itself, an I pay not down four hundred\ncrowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already robbed\nme of--gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value; besides what\nis broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my pouncer-box and\nsilver crisping-tongs.”\n\n“It is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your\nreverend bearing,” replied the Captain.\n\n“It is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,” said the Prior; “he\nswore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up on\nthe highest tree in the greenwood.”\n\n“Did he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had\nbetter comply with his demands--for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to\nabide by his word when he has so pledged it.” [43]\n\n“You do but jest with me,” said the astounded Prior, with a forced\nlaugh; “and I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when\nthe mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the\nmorning.”\n\n“And I am as grave as a father confessor,” replied the Outlaw; “you must\npay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be called to\na new election; for your place will know you no more.”\n\n“Are ye Christians,” said the Prior, “and hold this language to a\nchurchman?”\n\n“Christians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,”\n answered the Outlaw. “Let our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound to\nthis reverend father the texts which concern this matter.”\n\nThe Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar's frock over his\ngreen cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning\nhe had acquired by rote in former days, “Holy father,” said he, “'Deus\nfaciat salvam benignitatem vestram'--You are welcome to the greenwood.”\n\n“What profane mummery is this?” said the Prior. “Friend, if thou be'st\nindeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I may escape\nfrom these men's hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a\nmorris-dancer.”\n\n“Truly, reverend father,” said the Friar, “I know but one mode in which\nthou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew's day with us, we are taking our\ntithes.”\n\n“But not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?” said the Prior.\n\n“Of church and lay,” said the Friar; “and therefore, Sir Prior 'facite\nvobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis'--make yourselves friends of the\nMammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve your\nturn.”\n\n“I love a jolly woodsman at heart,” said the Prior, softening his tone;\n“come, ye must not deal too hard with me--I can well of woodcraft,\nand can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings\nagain--Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.”\n\n“Give him a horn,” said the Outlaw; “we will prove the skill he boasts\nof.”\n\nThe Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.\n\n“Sir Prior,” he said, “thou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom\nthee--we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight's shield hath it,\nto set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee--thou art\none of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the\nancient English bugle notes.--Prior, that last flourish on the recheat\nhath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old manly\nblasts of venerie.”\n\n“Well, friend,” said the Abbot, peevishly, “thou art ill to please with\nthy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my\nransom. At a word--since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the\ndevil--what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without\nhaving fifty men at my back?”\n\n“Were it not well,” said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the\nCaptain, “that the Prior should name the Jew's ransom, and the Jew name\nthe Prior's?”\n\n“Thou art a mad knave,” said the Captain, “but thy plan\ntranscends!--Here, Jew, step forth--Look at that holy Father Aymer,\nPrior of the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we\nshould hold him?--Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrant\nthee.”\n\n“O, assuredly,” said Isaac. “I have trafficked with the good fathers,\nand bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much\nwool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and\ndrink the sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx. Ah,\nif an outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by\nthe year and by the month, I would pay much gold and silver to redeem my\ncaptivity.”\n\n“Hound of a Jew!” exclaimed the Prior, “no one knows better than thy own\ncursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the finishing of\nour chancel--”\n\n“And for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due\nallowance of Gascon wine,” interrupted the Jew; “but that--that is small\nmatters.”\n\n“Hear the infidel dog!” said the churchman; “he jangles as if our holy\ncommunity did come under debts for the wines we have a license to\ndrink, 'propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum'. The circumcised\nvillain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men listen and rebuke\nhim not!”\n\n“All this helps nothing,” said the leader.--“Isaac, pronounce what he\nmay pay, without flaying both hide and hair.”\n\n“An six hundred crowns,” said Isaac, “the good Prior might well pay to\nyour honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.”\n\n“Six hundred crowns,” said the leader, gravely; “I am contented--thou\nhast well spoken, Isaac--six hundred crowns.--It is a sentence, Sir\nPrior.”\n\n“A sentence!--a sentence!” exclaimed the band; “Solomon had not done it\nbetter.”\n\n“Thou hearest thy doom, Prior,” said the leader.\n\n“Ye are mad, my masters,” said the Prior; “where am I to find such a\nsum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx,\nI shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose\nthat I go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows [44] my two\npriests.”\n\n“That will be but blind trust,” said the Outlaw; “we will retain thee,\nPrior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a cup of\nwine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft,\nthou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.”\n\n“Or, if so please you,” said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the\noutlaws, “I can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of certain\nmonies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will\ngrant me a quittance.”\n\n“He shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,” said the Captain;\n“and thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as well as\nfor thyself.”\n\n“For myself! ah, courageous sirs,” said the Jew, “I am a broken and\nimpoverished man; a beggar's staff must be my portion through life,\nsupposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.”\n\n“The Prior shall judge of that matter,” replied the Captain.--“How say\nyou, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?”\n\n“Can he afford a ransom?” answered the Prior “Is he not Isaac of York,\nrich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who\nwere led into Assyrian bondage?--I have seen but little of him myself,\nbut our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report\nsays that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame\nin any Christian land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that\nsuch gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the\nstate, and even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and\nextortions.”\n\n“Hold, father,” said the Jew, “mitigate and assuage your choler. I pray\nof your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no one. But\nwhen churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come\nknocking to Isaac's door, they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil\nterms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter,\nand our day shall be truly kept, so God sa' me?--and Kind Isaac, if ever\nyou served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day\ncomes, and I ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse\nof Egypt on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil\npopulace against poor strangers!”\n\n“Prior,” said the Captain, “Jew though he be, he hath in this spoken\nwell. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without\nfarther rude terms.”\n\n“None but 'latro famosus'--the interpretation whereof,” said the Prior,\n“will I give at some other time and tide--would place a Christian\nprelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye require\nme to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openly that ye will\nwrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns.”\n\n“A sentence!--a sentence!” exclaimed the chief Outlaw.\n\n“A sentence!--a sentence!” shouted his assessors; “the Christian has\nshown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than the Jew.”\n\n“The God of my fathers help me!” said the Jew; “will ye bear to the\nground an impoverished creature?--I am this day childless, and will ye\ndeprive me of the means of livelihood?”\n\n“Thou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,”\n said Aymer.\n\n“Alas! my lord,” said Isaac, “your law permits you not to know how the\nchild of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart--O Rebecca!\nlaughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a zecchin,\nand each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give to know\nwhether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!”\n\n“Was not thy daughter dark-haired?” said one of the outlaws; “and wore\nshe not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?”\n\n“She did!--she did!” said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as\nformerly with fear. “The blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canst thou tell\nme aught of her safety?”\n\n“It was she, then,” said the yeoman, “who was carried off by the proud\nTemplar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn my\nbow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the\ndamsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.”\n\n“Oh!” answered the Jew, “I would to God thou hadst shot, though the\narrow had pierced her bosom!--Better the tomb of her fathers than the\ndishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod!\nIchabod! the glory hath departed from my house!”\n\n“Friends,” said the Chief, looking round, “the old man is but a Jew,\nnatheless his grief touches me.--Deal uprightly with us, Isaac--will\npaying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether\npenniless?”\n\nIsaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by\ndint of inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection,\ngrew pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small\nsurplus.\n\n“Well--go to--what though there be,” said the Outlaw, “we will not\nreckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as well hope\nto redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as\nto shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.--We will take thee at the\nsame ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower,\nwhich hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon\nthis worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of\nrating a Jew merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt\nhave six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughter's ransom.\nTemplars love the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle\nof black eyes.--Hasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De\nBois-Guilbert, ere worse comes of it. Thou wilt find him, as our scouts\nhave brought notice, at the next Preceptory house of his Order.--Said I\nwell, my merry mates?”\n\nThe yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader's\nopinion; and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by\nlearning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw\nhimself at the feet of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard\nagainst his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The\nCaptain drew himself back, and extricated himself from the Jew's grasp,\nnot without some marks of contempt.\n\n“Nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no\nsuch Eastern prostrations--Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like\nme.”\n\n“Ay, Jew,” said Prior Aymer; “kneel to God, as represented in the\nservant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due\ngifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for\nthyself and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she is of\nfair and comely countenance,--I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much--bethink thee how\nthou mayst deserve my good word with him.”\n\n“Alas! alas!” said the Jew, “on every hand the spoilers arise against\nme--I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of\nEgypt.”\n\n“And what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?” answered\nthe Prior; “for what saith holy writ, 'verbum Domini projecerunt, et\nsapientia est nulla in eis'--they have cast forth the word of the\nLord, and there is no wisdom in them; 'propterea dabo mulieres eorum\nexteris'--I will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar,\nas in the present matter; 'et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienis',\nand their treasures to others--as in the present case to these honest\ngentlemen.”\n\nIsaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into\nhis state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led\nhim aside.\n\n“Advise thee well, Isaac,” said Locksley, “what thou wilt do in this\nmatter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is\nvain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his\nprofusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am\nblinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac,\nwith the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags--What!\nknow I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into\nthe vaulted chamber under thy garden at York?” The Jew grew as pale as\ndeath--“But fear nothing from me,” continued the yeoman, “for we are\nof old acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair\ndaughter Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in\nthy house till his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him\nrecovered, and with a piece of money?--Usurer as thou art, thou didst\nnever place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it\nhas this day saved thee five hundred crowns.”\n\n“And thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?” said Isaac; “I\nthought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.”\n\n“I am Bend-the-Bow,” said the Captain, “and Locksley, and have a good\nname besides all these.”\n\n“But thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same\nvaulted apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some\nmerchandises which I will gladly part with to you--one hundred yards\nof Lincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of\nSpanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round,\nand sound--these will I send thee for thy good-will, honest Diccon, an\nthou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.”\n\n“Silent as a dormouse,” said the Outlaw; “and never trust me but I am\ngrieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it--The Templars lances are\ntoo strong for my archery in the open field--they would scatter us like\ndust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off, something\nmight have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come,\nshall I treat for thee with the Prior?”\n\n“In God's name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my\nbosom!”\n\n“Do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,” said the\nOutlaw, “and I will deal with him in thy behalf.”\n\nHe then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as\nhis shadow.\n\n“Prior Aymer,” said the Captain, “come apart with me under this tree.\nMen say thou dost love wine, and a lady's smile, better than beseems thy\nOrder, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard, too,\nthou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well\nbe that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a\npurse of gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love oppression or\ncruelty.--Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure\nand pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver, if thy\nintercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the\nfreedom of his daughter.”\n\n“In safety and honour, as when taken from me,” said the Jew, “otherwise\nit is no bargain.”\n\n“Peace, Isaac,” said the Outlaw, “or I give up thine interest.--What say\nyou to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?”\n\n“The matter,” quoth the Prior, “is of a mixed condition; for, if I do a\ngood deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage\nof a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite\nwill advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the building\nof our dortour, [45] I will take it on my conscience to aid him in the\nmatter of his daughter.”\n\n“For a score of marks to the dortour,” said the Outlaw,--“Be still, I\nsay, Isaac!--or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, we will\nnot stand with you.”\n\n“Nay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow”--said Isaac, endeavouring to\ninterpose.\n\n“Good Jew--good beast--good earthworm!” said the yeoman, losing\npatience; “an thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance\nwith thy daughter's life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of\nevery maravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!”\n\nIsaac shrunk together, and was silent.\n\n“And what pledge am I to have for all this?” said the Prior.\n\n“When Isaac returns successful through your mediation,” said the Outlaw,\n“I swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the money in good\nsilver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better\nhave paid twenty such sums.”\n\n“Well then, Jew,” said Aymer, “since I must needs meddle in this matter,\nlet me have the use of thy writing-tablets--though, hold--rather than\nuse thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I find\none?”\n\n“If your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew's tablets, for\nthe pen I can find a remedy,” said the yeoman; and, bending his bow, he\naimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the\nadvanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way\nto the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came fluttering\ndown, transfixed with the arrow.\n\n“There, Prior,” said the Captain, “are quills enow to supply all the\nmonks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to\nwriting chronicles.”\n\nThe Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered\nthem to the Jew, saying, “This will be thy safe-conduct to the\nPreceptory of Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to accomplish\nthe delivery of thy daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of\nadvantage and commodity at thine own hand; for, trust me well, the\ngood Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for\nnought.”\n\n“Well, Prior,” said the Outlaw, “I will detain thee no longer here than\nto give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy\nransom is fixed--I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that\nye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint\nMary refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang\nten years the sooner!”\n\nWith a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to\nBois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of York\nof six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his\nransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that\nsum.\n\n“And now,” said Prior Aymer, “I will pray you of restitution of my mules\nand palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon\nme, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which\nI have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true\nprisoner.”\n\n“Touching your brethren, Sir Prior,” said Locksley, “they shall have\npresent freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses\nand mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may\nenable you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means\nof journeying.--But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else,\nyou must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will\nnot yield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the\nvanities of this life, the strong temptation to break the rule of his\nfoundation, by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.”\n\n“Think what you do, my masters,” said the Prior, “ere you put your hand\non the Church's patrimony--These things are 'inter res sacras', and\nI wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical\nhands.”\n\n“I will take care of that, reverend Prior,” said the Hermit of\nCopmanhurst; “for I will wear them myself.”\n\n“Friend, or brother,” said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his\ndoubts, “if thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to look\nhow thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in\nthis day's work.”\n\n“Friend Prior,” returned the Hermit, “you are to know that I belong to\na little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for the\nBishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the\nconvent.”\n\n“Thou art utterly irregular,” said the Prior; “one of those disorderly\nmen, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause, profane\nthe holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at\ntheir hands; 'lapides pro pane condonantes iis', giving them stones\ninstead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.”\n\n“Nay,” said the Friar, “an my brain-pan could have been broken by Latin,\nit had not held so long together.--I say, that easing a world of such\nmisproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a\nlawful spoiling of the Egyptians.”\n\n“Thou be'st a hedge-priest,” [46] said the Prior, in great wrath,\n“'excommunicabo vos'.”\n\n“Thou be'st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,” said the\nFriar, equally indignant; “I will pouch up no such affront before my\nparishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I\nbe a reverend brother to thee. 'Ossa ejus perfringam', I will break your\nbones, as the Vulgate hath it.”\n\n“Hola!” cried the Captain, “come the reverend brethren to such\nterms?--Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.--Prior, an thou hast not\nmade thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.--Hermit,\nlet the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.”\n\nThe yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their\nvoices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered\nthe more fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior\nat length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was\ncompromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the\nOutlaw's chaplain, and being joined by his attendants, rode off with\nconsiderably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so\nfar as worldly matters were concerned, than he had exhibited before this\nrencounter.\n\nIt remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom\nwhich he was to pay on the Prior's account, as well as upon his own. He\ngave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his\ntribe at York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand\ncrowns, and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.\n\n“My brother Sheva,” he said, groaning deeply, “hath the key of my\nwarehouses.”\n\n“And of the vaulted chamber,” whispered Locksley.\n\n“No, no--may Heaven forefend!” said Isaac; “evil is the hour that let\nany one whomsoever into that secret!”\n\n“It is safe with me,” said the Outlaw, “so be that this thy scroll\nproduce the sum therein nominated and set down.--But what now, Isaac?\nart dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy\ndaughter's peril out of thy mind?”\n\nThe Jew started to his feet--“No, Diccon, no--I will presently set\nforth.--Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and will\nnot call evil.”\n\nYet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting\nadvice:--“Be liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse for\nthy daughter's safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in\nher cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured\nmolten down thy throat.”\n\nIsaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey,\naccompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the\nsame time his guards, through the wood.\n\nThe Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various\nproceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he\navoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil\npolicy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and\ninfluence of the laws.\n\n“Good fruit, Sir Knight,” said the yeoman, “will sometimes grow on a\nsorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and\nunmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there\nare, doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise its license with some\nmoderation, and some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to\nfollow such a trade at all.”\n\n“And to one of those,” said the Knight, “I am now, I presume, speaking?”\n\n“Sir Knight,” said the Outlaw, “we have each our secret. You are welcome\nto form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures touching you,\nthough neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as\nI do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not offended that I\npreserve my own.”\n\n“I crave pardon, brave Outlaw,” said the Knight, “your reproof is just.\nBut it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on either\nside.--Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?”\n\n“There is my hand upon it,” said Locksley; “and I will call it the hand\nof a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.”\n\n“And there is mine in return,” said the Knight, “and I hold it honoured\nby being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the unlimited\npower to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he\nperforms, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well, gallant\nOutlaw!” Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock,\nmounting upon his strong war-horse, rode off through the forest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n     KING JOHN.--I'll tell thee what, my friend,\n     He is a very serpent in my way;\n     And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,\n     He lies before me.--Dost thou understand me?\n     --King John\n\nThere was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John\nhad invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he\nhoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother's throne.\nWaldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among\nthem, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in\nmaking an open declaration of their purpose. But their enterprise was\ndelayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy.\nThe stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of Front-de-Boeuf; the\nbuoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy; the sagacity, martial\nexperience, and renowned valour of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, were\nimportant to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in\nsecret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither John nor his\nadviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to have\nvanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the\nsubsidy for which Prince John had contracted with that Israelite and his\nbrethren. This deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency\nso critical.\n\nIt was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused\nreport began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and\nBois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-Boeuf, had been taken or\nslain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he\nfeared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance,\nfor the purpose of committing an assault on the Saxon Cedric and his\nattendants. At another time the Prince would have treated this deed of\nviolence as a good jest; but now, that it interfered with and impeded\nhis own plans, he exclaimed against the perpetrators, and spoke of\nthe broken laws, and the infringement of public order and of private\nproperty, in a tone which might have become King Alfred.\n\n“The unprincipled marauders,” he said--“were I ever to become monarch of\nEngland, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their\nown castles.”\n\n“But to become monarch of England,” said his Ahithophel coolly, “it is\nnecessary not only that your Grace should endure the transgressions\nof these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your\nprotection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in\nthe habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl\nSaxons should have realized your Grace's vision, of converting feudal\ndrawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to\nwhom such an imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it will\nbe dangerous to stir without Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar;\nand yet we have gone too far to recede with safety.”\n\nPrince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to\nstride up and down the apartment.\n\n“The villains,” he said, “the base treacherous villains, to desert me at\nthis pinch!”\n\n“Nay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,” said Waldemar, “who\nmust be toying with follies when such business was in hand.”\n\n“What is to be done?” said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar.\n\n“I know nothing which can be done,” answered his counsellor, “save that\nwhich I have already taken order for.--I came not to bewail this evil\nchance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.”\n\n“Thou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,” said the Prince; “and when\nI have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John will be\nrenowned in our annals.--What hast thou commanded?”\n\n“I have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy's lieutenant, to cause his\ntrumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently\nforth towards the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, to do what yet may be done\nfor the succour of our friends.”\n\nPrince John's face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has\nundergone what it conceives to be an insult. “By the face of God!”\n he said, “Waldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over\nmalapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in\na town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.”\n\n“I crave your Grace's pardon,” said Fitzurse, internally cursing the\nidle vanity of his patron; “but when time pressed, and even the loss of\nminutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon\nme, in a matter of such importance to your Grace's interest.”\n\n“Thou art pardoned, Fitzurse,” said the prince, gravely; “thy purpose\nhath atoned for thy hasty rashness.--But whom have we here?--De Bracy\nhimself, by the rood!--and in strange guise doth he come before us.”\n\nIt was indeed De Bracy--“bloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.”\n His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken,\ndefaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay\nand dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it\non the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told\nhis news.\n\n“De Bracy,” said Prince John, “what means this?--Speak, I charge\nthee!--Are the Saxons in rebellion?”\n\n“Speak, De Bracy,” said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his\nmaster, “thou wert wont to be a man--Where is the Templar?--where\nFront-de-Boeuf?”\n\n“The Templar is fled,” said De Bracy; “Front-de-Boeuf you will never\nsee more. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own\ncastle and I alone am escaped to tell you.”\n\n“Cold news,” said Waldemar, “to us, though you speak of fire and\nconflagration.”\n\n“The worst news is not yet said,” answered De Bracy; and, coming up\nto Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone--“Richard is in\nEngland--I have seen and spoken with him.”\n\nPrince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken\nbench to support himself--much like to a man who receives an arrow in\nhis bosom.\n\n“Thou ravest, De Bracy,” said Fitzurse, “it cannot be.”\n\n“It is as true as truth itself,” said De Bracy; “I was his prisoner, and\nspoke with him.”\n\n“With Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?” continued Fitzurse.\n\n“With Richard Plantagenet,” replied De Bracy, “with Richard\nCoeur-de-Lion--with Richard of England.”\n\n“And thou wert his prisoner?” said Waldemar; “he is then at the head of\na power?”\n\n“No--only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his person\nis unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He joined\nthem only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.”\n\n“Ay,” said Fitzurse, “such is indeed the fashion of Richard--a true\nknight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting the\nprowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while\nthe weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is\nendangered.--What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?”\n\n“I?--I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused\nthem--I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for\nFlanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find\nemployment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay\ndown thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God\nsends us?”\n\n“I am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,” answered Waldemar.\n\n“Give her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank,\nwith the help of lance and stirrup,” said De Bracy.\n\n“Not so,” answered Fitzurse; “I will take sanctuary in this church of\nSaint Peter--the Archbishop is my sworn brother.”\n\nDuring this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the\nstupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence,\nand had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his\nfollowers. “They fall off from me,” he said to himself, “they hold no\nmore by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on\nit!--Hell and fiends! can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted\nby these cravens?”--He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical\npassion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on\ntheir conversation.\n\n“Ha, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady's brow, I held ye\nsage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour,\npleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might\nbe won by one bold cast!”\n\n“I understand you not,” said De Bracy. “As soon as Richard's return is\nblown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over\nwith us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France or take\nthe protection of the Queen Mother.”\n\n“I seek no safety for myself,” said Prince John, haughtily; “that I\ncould secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De Bracy,\nand you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not\ngreatly delight to see your heads blackening on Clifford's gate yonder.\nThinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee\nto be taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make his\npeace with King Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert\nEstoteville lies betwixt thee and Hull with all his forces, and that the\nEarl of Essex is gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear these\nlevies even before Richard's return, trowest thou there is any doubt\nnow which party their leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has\nstrength enough to drive all thy Free Lances into the Humber.”--Waldemar\nFitzurse and De Bracy looked in each other's faces with blank\ndismay.--“There is but one road to safety,” continued the Prince, and\nhis brow grew black as midnight; “this object of our terror journeys\nalone--He must be met withal.”\n\n“Not by me,” said De Bracy, hastily; “I was his prisoner, and he took me\nto mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.”\n\n“Who spoke of harming him?” said Prince John, with a hardened laugh;\n“the knave will say next that I meant he should slay him!--No--a prison\nwere better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?--Things\nwill be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise--It was\nfounded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany--Our\nuncle Robert lived and died in the castle of Cardiffe.”\n\n“Ay, but,” said Waldemar, “your sire Henry sate more firm in his seat\nthan your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by the\nsexton--no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.”\n\n“Prison or tomb,” said De Bracy, “I wash my hands of the whole matter.”\n\n“Villain!” said Prince John, “thou wouldst not bewray our counsel?”\n\n“Counsel was never bewrayed by me,” said De Bracy, haughtily, “nor must\nthe name of villain be coupled with mine!”\n\n“Peace, Sir Knight!” said Waldemar; “and you, good my lord, forgive the\nscruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove them.”\n\n“That passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,” replied the Knight.\n\n“Why, good Sir Maurice,” rejoined the wily politician, “start not aside\nlike a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of your\nterror.--This Richard--but a day since, and it would have been thy\ndearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle--a\nhundred times I have heard thee wish it.”\n\n“Ay,” said De Bracy, “but that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and\nin the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of\nassaulting him alone, and in a forest.”\n\n“Thou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,” said Waldemar.\n“Was it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won renown? or\nwas it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and\nunknown forests?”\n\n“Ay, but I promise you,” said De Bracy, “that neither Tristram nor\nLancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard Plantagenet,\nand I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.”\n\n“Thou art mad, De Bracy--what is it we propose to thee, a hired and\nretained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for\nPrince John's service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou\nscruplest, though thy patron's fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine\nown, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!”\n\n“I tell you,” said De Bracy, sullenly, “that he gave me my life. True,\nhe sent me from his presence, and refused my homage--so far I owe him\nneither favour nor allegiance--but I will not lift hand against him.”\n\n“It needs not--send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.”\n\n“Ye have sufficient ruffians of your own,” said De Bracy; “not one of\nmine shall budge on such an errand.”\n\n“Art thou so obstinate, De Bracy?” said Prince John; “and wilt thou\nforsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?”\n\n“I mean it not,” said De Bracy; “I will abide by you in aught that\nbecomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway\npractice comes not within my vow.”\n\n“Come hither, Waldemar,” said Prince John. “An unhappy prince am I. My\nfather, King Henry, had faithful servants--He had but to say that he was\nplagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint\nthough he was, stained the steps of his own altar.--Tracy, Morville,\nBrito [47] loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are\nextinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen\noff from his father's fidelity and courage.”\n\n“He has fallen off from neither,” said Waldemar Fitzurse; “and since\nit may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this perilous\nenterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a\nzealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far short\nof what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar\nof saints, than put spear in rest against Coeur-de-Lion.--De Bracy, to\nthee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard\nPrince John's person. If you receive such news as I trust to send you,\nour enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.--Page,” he said,\n“hie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in readiness; and\nbid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow,\ncome to me instantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me\nalso.--Adieu, my Prince, till better times.” Thus speaking, he left the\napartment. “He goes to make my brother prisoner,” said Prince John to De\nBracy, “with as little touch of compunction, as if it but concerned the\nliberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders, and use\nour dear Richard's person with all due respect.”\n\nDe Bracy only answered by a smile.\n\n“By the light of Our Lady's brow,” said Prince John, “our orders to\nhim were most precise--though it may be you heard them not, as we stood\ntogether in the oriel window--Most clear and positive was our charge\nthat Richard's safety should be cared for, and woe to Waldemar's head if\nhe transgress it!”\n\n“I had better pass to his lodgings,” said De Bracy, “and make him fully\naware of your Grace's pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may\nnot perchance have reached that of Waldemar.”\n\n“Nay, nay,” said Prince John, impatiently, “I promise thee he heard me;\nand, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come hither;\nlet me lean on thy shoulder.”\n\nThey walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince\nJohn, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say,\n“What thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?--He trusts\nto be our Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office so high\nto one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so\nreadily undertaking this enterprise against Richard. Thou dost think,\nI warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly\ndeclining this unpleasing task--But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee\nfor thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary to be done,\nthe perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and there may be\nrefusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our estimation those\nwho deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no\nsuch good title to the high office of Chancellor, as thy chivalrous and\ncourageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of High Marshal.\nThink of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.”\n\n“Fickle tyrant!” muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the\nPrince; “evil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor, indeed!--He\nwho hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I\ntrow. But High Marshal of England! that,” he said, extending his arm, as\nif to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the\nantechamber, “that is indeed a prize worth playing for!”\n\nDe Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an\nattendant.\n\n“Bid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall\nhave spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.”\n\nThe scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John\ntraversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.\n\n“Bardon,” said he, “what did Waldemar desire of thee?”\n\n“Two resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and\nskilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.”\n\n“And thou hast fitted him?”\n\n“Let your grace never trust me else,” answered the master of the spies.\n“One is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and Teviotdale\nthieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other\nis Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry\nSherwood; he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt\nthis and Richmond.”\n\n“'Tis well,” said the Prince.--“Goes Waldemar forth with them?”\n\n“Instantly,” said Bardon.\n\n“With what attendance?” asked John, carelessly.\n\n“Broad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his\ncruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that\nbelonged to Ralph Middleton's gang--they are called the Spears of\nSpyinghow.”\n\n“'Tis well,” said Prince John; then added, after a moment's pause,\n“Bardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on Maurice\nDe Bracy--so that he shall not observe it, however--And let us know\nof his motions from time to time--with whom he converses, what he\nproposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.”\n\nHugh Bardon bowed, and retired.\n\n“If Maurice betrays me,” said Prince John--“if he betrays me, as his\nbearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard thundering\nat the gates of York.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n     Arouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,\n     Strive with the half-starved lion for his prey;\n     Lesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering fire\n     Of wild Fanaticism.\n     --Anonymus\n\nOur tale now returns to Isaac of York.--Mounted upon a mule, the gift of\nthe Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the\nJew had set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of\nnegotiating his daughter's redemption. The Preceptory was but a day's\njourney from the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had\nhoped to reach it before nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his\nguides at the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of\nsilver, he began to press on with such speed as his weariness permitted\nhim to exert. But his strength failed him totally ere he had reached\nwithin four miles of the Temple-Court; racking pains shot along his back\nand through his limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt at heart\nbeing now augmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered altogether\nincapable of proceeding farther than a small market-town, were dwelt\na Jewish Rabbi of his tribe, eminent in the medical profession, and\nto whom Isaac was well known. Nathan Ben Israel received his suffering\ncountryman with that kindness which the law prescribed, and which the\nJews practised to each other. He insisted on his betaking himself to\nrepose, and used such remedies as were then in most repute to check the\nprogress of the fever, which terror, fatigue, ill usage, and sorrow, had\nbrought upon the poor old Jew.\n\nOn the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey,\nNathan remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host and as his\nphysician. It might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied,\nthat more than life and death depended upon his going that morning to\nTemplestowe.\n\n“To Templestowe!” said his host with surprise again felt his pulse,\nand then muttered to himself, “His fever is abated, yet seems his mind\nsomewhat alienated and disturbed.”\n\n“And why not to Templestowe?” answered his patient. “I grant thee,\nNathan, that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised Children of\nthe Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest\nthat pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these\nbloodthirsty Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of\nthe Templars, as well as the Commanderies of the Knights Hospitallers,\nas they are called.” [48]\n\n“I know it well,” said Nathan; “but wottest thou that Lucas de\nBeaumanoir, the chief of their Order, and whom they term Grand Master,\nis now himself at Templestowe?”\n\n“I know it not,” said Isaac; “our last letters from our brethren at\nParis advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for aid\nagainst the Sultan Saladine.”\n\n“He hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,” said Ben\nIsrael; “and he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm to\ncorrect and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against those\nwho have departed from the vow which they have made, and great is the\nfear of those sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?”\n\n“It is well known unto me,” said Isaac; “the Gentiles deliver this Lucas\nBeaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the Nazarene\nlaw; and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of the\nSaracens, and a cruel tyrant to the Children of the Promise.”\n\n“And truly have they termed him,” said Nathan the physician. “Other\nTemplars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure, or\nbribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different\nstamp--hating sensuality, despising treasure, and pressing forward to\nthat which they call the crown of martyrdom--The God of Jacob speedily\nsend it unto him, and unto them all! Specially hath this proud man\nextended his glove over the children of Judah, as holy David over Edom,\nholding the murder of a Jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as the\ndeath of a Saracen. Impious and false things has he said even of the\nvirtues of our medicines, as if they were the devices of Satan--The Lord\nrebuke him!”\n\n“Nevertheless,” said Isaac, “I must present myself at Templestowe,\nthough he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times\nheated.”\n\nHe then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The Rabbi\nlistened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of\nhis people, rending his clothes, and saying, “Ah, my daughter!--ah, my\ndaughter!--Alas! for the beauty of Zion!--Alas! for the captivity of\nIsrael!”\n\n“Thou seest,” said Isaac, “how it stands with me, and that I may not\ntarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir, being the\nchief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which\nhe doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter\nRebecca.”\n\n“Go thou,” said Nathan Ben Israel, “and be wise, for wisdom availed\nDaniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well\nwith thee, even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee\nfrom the presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scorn to our\npeople is his morning and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst\nspeak with Bois-Guilbert in private, thou shalt the better prevail with\nhim; for men say that these accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in\nthe Preceptory--May their counsels be confounded and brought to shame!\nBut do thou, brother, return to me as if it were to the house of thy\nfather, and bring me word how it has sped with thee; and well do I hope\nthou wilt bring with thee Rebecca, even the scholar of the wise Miriam,\nwhose cures the Gentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by\nnecromancy.”\n\nIsaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour's riding\nbrought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.\n\nThis establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and\npastures, which the devotion of the former Preceptor had bestowed upon\ntheir Order. It was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected\nby these knights, and which the disordered state of England rendered\npeculiarly necessary. Two halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the\ndrawbridge, and others, in the same sad livery, glided to and fro upon\nthe walls with a funereal pace, resembling spectres more than soldiers.\nThe inferior officers of the Order were thus dressed, ever since their\nuse of white garments, similar to those of the knights and esquires, had\ngiven rise to a combination of certain false brethren in the mountains\nof Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great dishonour\non the Order. A knight was now and then seen to cross the court in his\nlong white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and his arms folded.\nThey passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn,\nand mute greeting; for such was the rule of their Order, quoting\nthereupon the holy texts, “In many words thou shalt not avoid sin,” and\n“Life and death are in the power of the tongue.” In a word, the\nstern ascetic rigour of the Temple discipline, which had been so long\nexchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence, seemed at once to have\nrevived at Templestowe under the severe eye of Lucas Beaumanoir.\n\nIsaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the\nmanner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to his\nunhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less dangerous\nthan their unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion would be\nthe object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his wealth\nwould have exposed him in the other to the extortions of unrelenting\noppression.\n\nMeantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the\nPreceptory, included within the precincts of its exterior fortification,\nand held sad and confidential communication with a brother of his Order,\nwho had come in his company from Palestine.\n\nThe Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testified by his long\ngrey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of which,\nhowever, years had been unable to quench the fire. A formidable warrior,\nhis thin and severe features retained the soldier's fierceness of\nexpression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation\nof abstinence, and the spiritual pride of the self-satisfied devotee.\nYet with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat\nstriking and noble, arising, doubtless, from the great part which his\nhigh office called upon him to act among monarchs and princes, and\nfrom the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the valiant and\nhigh-born knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His\nstature was tall, and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was\nerect and stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe regularity,\naccording to the rule of Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what\nwas then called Burrel cloth, exactly fitted to the size of the wearer,\nand bearing on the left shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the\nOrder, formed of red cloth. No vair or ermine decked this garment; but\nin respect of his age, the Grand Master, as permitted by the rules, wore\nhis doublet lined and trimmed with the softest lambskin, dressed with\nthe wool outwards, which was the nearest approach he could regularly\nmake to the use of fur, then the greatest luxury of dress. In his hand\nhe bore that singular “abacus”, or staff of office, with which Templars\nare usually represented, having at the upper end a round plate, on which\nwas engraved the cross of the Order, inscribed within a circle or orle,\nas heralds term it. His companion, who attended on this great personage,\nhad nearly the same dress in all respects, but his extreme deference\ntowards his Superior showed that no other equality subsisted between\nthem. The Preceptor, for such he was in rank, walked not in a line with\nthe Grand Master, but just so far behind that Beaumanoir could speak to\nhim without turning round his head.\n\n“Conrade,” said the Grand Master, “dear companion of my battles and my\ntoils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can confide my sorrows. To thee\nalone can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired\nto be dissolved and to be with the just. Not one object in England hath\nmet mine eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of\nour brethren, beneath the massive roof of our Temple Church in yonder\nproud capital. O, valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I\ngazed upon these good soldiers of the cross, where they lie sculptured\non their sepulchres,--O, worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble\ncells, and take to your repose a weary brother, who would rather strive\nwith a hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our Holy\nOrder!”\n\n“It is but true,” answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; “it is but too true;\nand the irregularities of our brethren in England are even more gross\nthan those in France.”\n\n“Because they are more wealthy,” answered the Grand Master. “Bear with\nme, brother, although I should something vaunt myself. Thou knowest the\nlife I have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with devils\nembodied and disembodied, striking down the roaring lion, who goeth\nabout seeking whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout\npriest, wheresoever I met with him--even as blessed Saint Bernard hath\nprescribed to us in the forty-fifth capital of our rule, 'Ut Leo semper\nferiatur'. [49]\n\n“But by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and\nmy life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones; by that very Holy\nTemple I swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still retain\nthe ancient severity of our Order, I look upon no brethren whom I can\nbring my soul to embrace under that holy name. What say our statutes,\nand how do our brethren observe them? They should wear no vain or\nworldly ornament, no crest upon their helmet, no gold upon stirrup or\nbridle-bit; yet who now go pranked out so proudly and so gaily as the\npoor soldiers of the Temple? They are forbidden by our statutes to take\none bird by means of another, to shoot beasts with bow or arblast, to\nhalloo to a hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after game. But now,\nat hunting and hawking, and each idle sport of wood and river, who so\nprompt as the Templars in all these fond vanities? They are forbidden\nto read, save what their Superior permitted, or listen to what is\nread, save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the hours of\nrefaction; but lo! their ears are at the command of idle minstrels, and\ntheir eyes study empty romaunts. They were commanded to extirpate magic\nand heresy. Lo! they are charged with studying the accursed cabalistical\nsecrets of the Jews, and the magic of the Paynim Saracens. Simpleness\nof diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage, gruels, eating flesh\nbut thrice a-week, because the accustomed feeding on flesh is a\ndishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their tables groan\nunder delicate fare! Their drink was to be water, and now, to drink like\na Templar, is the boast of each jolly boon companion! This very garden,\nfilled as it is with curious herbs and trees sent from the Eastern\nclimes, better becomes the harem of an unbelieving Emir, than the\nplot which Christian Monks should devote to raise their homely\npot-herbs.--And O, Conrade! well it were that the relaxation of\ndiscipline stopped even here!--Well thou knowest that we were forbidden\nto receive those devout women, who at the beginning were associated\nas sisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth chapter, the\nAncient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from the right\npath to paradise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were, the\ncope-stone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled\ndoctrine which he had enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even to\nour sisters and our mothers, the kiss of affection--'ut omnium\nmulierum fugiantur oscula'.--I shame to speak--I shame to think--of the\ncorruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood. The souls\nof our pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint\nOmer, and of the blessed Seven who first joined in dedicating their\nlives to the service of the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment\nof paradise itself. I have seen them, Conrade, in the visions of the\nnight--their sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their\nbrethren, and for the foul and shameful luxury in which they wallow.\nBeaumanoir, they say, thou slumberest--awake! There is a stain in the\nfabric of the Temple, deep and foul as that left by the streaks of\nleprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old. [50]\n\n“The soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as the\neye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their own\nrace only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more\naccursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!--Slay\nthe sinners, male and female!--Take to thee the brand of Phineas!--The\nvision fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I could still hear the clank of\ntheir mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.--And I will do\naccording to their word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the\nunclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the\nbuilding.”\n\n“Yet bethink thee, reverend father,” said Mont-Fitchet, “the stain\nhath become engrained by time and consuetude; let thy reformation be\ncautious, as it is just and wise.”\n\n“No, Mont-Fitchet,” answered the stern old man--“it must be sharp\nand sudden--the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,\nself-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful\nfriends--our presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised up\nagainst us mighty enemies.--We must cast away these riches, which are\na temptation to princes--we must lay down that presumption, which is\nan offence to them--we must reform that license of manners, which is a\nscandal to the whole Christian world! Or--mark my words--the Order of\nthe Temple will be utterly demolished--and the Place thereof shall no\nmore be known among the nations.”\n\n“Now may God avert such a calamity!” said the Preceptor.\n\n“Amen,” said the Grand Master, with solemnity, “but we must deserve his\naid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers in Heaven, nor\nthe powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this\ngeneration--My intelligence is sure--the ground on which our fabric is\nreared is already undermined, and each addition we make to the structure\nof our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss. We must\nretrace our steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of\nthe Cross, sacrificing to our calling, not alone our blood and our\nlives--not alone our lusts and our vices--but our ease, our comforts,\nand our natural affections, and act as men convinced that many a\npleasure which may be lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed\nsoldier of the Temple.”\n\nAt this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the\naspirants after this holy Order wore during their noviciate the cast-off\ngarments of the knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing profoundly\nbefore the Grand Master, stood silent, awaiting his permission ere he\npresumed to tell his errand.\n\n“Is it not more seemly,” said the Grand Master, “to see this Damian,\nclothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear with reverend\nsilence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the fond fool\nwas decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as proud as any\npopinjay?--Speak, Damian, we permit thee--What is thine errand?”\n\n“A Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,” said the\nSquire, “who prays to speak with brother Brian de Bois-Guilbert.”\n\n“Thou wert right to give me knowledge of it,” said the Grand Master; “in\nour presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer of our Order, who\nmay not walk according to his own will, but to that of his Master--even\naccording to the text, 'In the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed\nme.'--It imports us especially to know of this Bois-Guilbert's\nproceedings,” said he, turning to his companion.\n\n“Report speaks him brave and valiant,” said Conrade.\n\n“And truly is he so spoken of,” said the Grand Master; “in our valour\nonly we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroes of the\nCross. But brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed\nman, stirred, I doubt me, to take our vows and to renounce the world,\nnot in sincerity of soul, but as one whom some touch of light discontent\nhad driven into penitence. Since then, he hath become an active and\nearnest agitator, a murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst\nthose who impugn our authority; not considering that the rule is given\nto the Master even by the symbol of the staff and the rod--the staff to\nsupport the infirmities of the weak--the rod to correct the faults of\ndelinquents.--Damian,” he continued, “lead the Jew to our presence.”\n\nThe squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes\nreturned, marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave, ushered into the\npresence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with\nmore profound reverence and terror than that with which the Jew drew\nnear to the presence of the Grand Master. When he had approached within\nthe distance of three yards, Beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that\nhe should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down on the earth which he\nkissed in token of reverence; then rising, stood before the Templars,\nhis hands folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast, in all the\nsubmission of Oriental slavery.\n\n“Damian,” said the Grand Master, “retire, and have a guard ready to\nawait our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the garden until we\nshall leave it.”--The squire bowed and retreated.--“Jew,” continued the\nhaughty old man, “mark me. It suits not our condition to hold with\nthee long communication, nor do we waste words or time upon any one.\nWherefore be brief in thy answers to what questions I shall ask thee,\nand let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue doubles with me, I will\nhave it torn from thy misbelieving jaws.”\n\nThe Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.\n\n“Peace, unbeliever!--not a word in our presence, save in answer to\nour questions.--What is thy business with our brother Brian de\nBois-Guilbert?”\n\nIsaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be\ninterpreted into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, what\nhope could he have of achieving his daughter's deliverance? Beaumanoir\nsaw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some\nassurance.\n\n“Fear nothing,” he said, “for thy wretched person, Jew, so thou dealest\nuprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from thee thy business\nwith Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”\n\n“I am bearer of a letter,” stammered out the Jew, “so please your\nreverend valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of the Abbey of\nJorvaulx.”\n\n“Said I not these were evil times, Conrade?” said the Master. “A\nCistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and can find\nno more fitting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.--Give me the letter.”\n\nThe Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in\nwhich he had deposited the Prior's tablets for the greater security, and\nwas about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it\nwithin the reach of his grim interrogator.\n\n“Back, dog!” said the Grand Master; “I touch not misbelievers, save with\nthe sword.--Conrade, take thou the letter from the Jew, and give it to\nme.”\n\nBeaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside\ncarefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its\nfolds. “Reverend father,” said Conrade, interposing, though with much\ndeference, “wilt thou break the seal?”\n\n“And will I not?” said Beaumanoir, with a frown. “Is it not written in\nthe forty-second capital, 'De Lectione Literarum' that a Templar shall\nnot receive a letter, no not from his father, without communicating the\nsame to the Grand Master, and reading it in his presence?”\n\nHe then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and\nhorror; read it over again more slowly; then holding it out to Conrade\nwith one hand, and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed--“Here\nis goodly stuff for one Christian man to write to another, and both\nmembers, and no inconsiderable members, of religious professions! When,”\n said he solemnly, and looking upward, “wilt thou come with thy fanners\nto purge the thrashing-floor?”\n\nMont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse\nit.\n\n“Read it aloud, Conrade,” said the Grand Master,--“and do thou”\n (to Isaac) “attend to the purport of it, for we will question thee\nconcerning it.”\n\nConrade read the letter, which was in these words: “Aymer, by divine\ngrace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Mary's of Jorvaulx, to\nSir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple,\nwisheth health, with the bounties of King Bacchus and of my Lady Venus.\nTouching our present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the\nhands of certain lawless and godless men, who have not feared to detain\nour person, and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of\nFront-de-Boeuf's misfortune, and that thou hast escaped with that fair\nJewish sorceress, whose black eyes have bewitched thee. We are heartily\nrejoiced of thy safety; nevertheless, we pray thee to be on thy guard in\nthe matter of this second Witch of Endor; for we are privately assured\nthat your Great Master, who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks and\nblack eyes, comes from Normandy to diminish your mirth, and amend your\nmisdoings. Wherefore we pray you heartily to beware, and to be found\nwatching, even as the Holy Text hath it, 'Invenientur vigilantes'. And\nthe wealthy Jew her father, Isaac of York, having prayed of me letters\nin his behalf, I gave him these, earnestly advising, and in a sort\nentreating, that you do hold the damsel to ransom, seeing he will pay\nyou from his bags as much as may find fifty damsels upon safer terms,\nwhereof I trust to have my part when we make merry together, as true\nbrothers, not forgetting the wine-cup. For what saith the text, 'Vinum\nlaetificat cor hominis'; and again, 'Rex delectabitur pulchritudine\ntua'.\n\n“Till which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of\nthieves, about the hour of matins,\n\n“Aymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.\n\n“'Postscriptum.' Truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me,\nand will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw deer-stealer, the\nwhistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.”\n\n“What sayest thou to this, Conrade?” said the Grand Master--“Den of\nthieves! and a fit residence is a den of thieves for such a Prior. No\nwonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy Land we\nlose place by place, foot by foot, before the infidels, when we have\nsuch churchmen as this Aymer.--And what meaneth he, I trow, by this\nsecond Witch of Endor?” said he to his confident, something apart.\nConrade was better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of\ngallantry, than was his Superior; and he expounded the passage which\nembarrassed the Grand Master, to be a sort of language used by worldly\nmen towards those whom they loved 'par amours'; but the explanation did\nnot satisfy the bigoted Beaumanoir.\n\n“There is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is\nno match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca of York was a\npupil of that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew\nown it even now.” Then turning to Isaac, he said aloud, “Thy daughter,\nthen, is prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?”\n\n“Ay, reverend valorous sir,” stammered poor Isaac, “and whatsoever\nransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance---”\n\n“Peace!” said the Grand Master. “This thy daughter hath practised the\nart of healing, hath she not?”\n\n“Ay, gracious sir,” answered the Jew, with more confidence; “and knight\nand yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly gift which Heaven\nhath assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath recovered\nthem by her art, when every other human aid hath proved vain; but the\nblessing of the God of Jacob was upon her.”\n\nBeaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. “See, brother,”\n he said, “the deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold the baits\nwith which he fishes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life in\nexchange for eternal happiness hereafter. Well said our blessed\nrule, 'Semper percutiatur leo vorans'.--Up on the lion! Down with the\ndestroyer!” said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, as if in defiance\nof the powers of darkness--“Thy daughter worketh the cures, I doubt\nnot,” thus he went on to address the Jew, “by words and sighs, and\nperiapts, and other cabalistical mysteries.”\n\n“Nay, reverend and brave Knight,” answered Isaac, “but in chief measure\nby a balsam of marvellous virtue.”\n\n“Where had she that secret?” said Beaumanoir.\n\n“It was delivered to her,” answered Isaac, reluctantly, “by Miriam, a\nsage matron of our tribe.”\n\n“Ah, false Jew!” said the Grand Master; “was it not from that same\nwitch Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of\nthroughout every Christian land?” exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing\nhimself. “Her body was burnt at a stake, and her ashes were scattered to\nthe four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as\nmuch to her pupil, and more also! I will teach her to throw spell and\nincantation over the soldiers of the blessed Temple.--There, Damian,\nspurn this Jew from the gate--shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again.\nWith his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high\noffice warrant.”\n\nPoor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the\npreceptory; all his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard and\ndisregarded. He could do not better than return to the house of the\nRabbi, and endeavour, through his means, to learn how his daughter was\nto be disposed of. He had hitherto feared for her honour, he was now\nto tremble for her life. Meanwhile, the Grand Master ordered to his\npresence the Preceptor of Templestowe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n     Say not my art is fraud--all live by seeming.\n     The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier\n     Gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;\n     The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier\n     Will eke with it his service.--All admit it,\n     All practise it; and he who is content\n     With showing what he is, shall have small credit\n     In church, or camp, or state--So wags the world.\n     --Old Play\n\nAlbert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor\nof the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that Philip\nMalvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history,\nand was, like that baron, in close league with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\n\nAmongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order\nincluded but too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished; but\nwith this difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how\nto throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to\nassume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised.\nHad not the arrival of the Grand Master been so unexpectedly sudden,\nhe would have seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to\nargue any relaxation of discipline. And, even although surprised, and,\nto a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such\nrespect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made\nsuch haste to reform the particulars he censured,--succeeded, in fine,\nso well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been\nlately devoted to license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began to\nentertain a higher opinion of the Preceptor's morals, than the first\nappearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.\n\nBut these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were\ngreatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a\nhouse of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the\nparamour of a brother of the Order; and when Albert appeared before him,\nhe was regarded with unwonted sternness.\n\n“There is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order\nof the Temple,” said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, “a Jewish\nwoman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir\nPreceptor.”\n\nAlbert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate\nRebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building,\nand every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being\nknown. He read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to\nhimself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.\n\n“Why are you mute?” continued the Grand Master.\n\n“Is it permitted to me to reply?” answered the Preceptor, in a tone of\nthe deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an\ninstant's space for arranging his ideas.\n\n“Speak, you are permitted,” said the Grand Master--“speak, and say,\nknowest thou the capital of our holy rule,--'De commilitonibus Templi\nin sancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter\noblectationem carnis?'” [51]\n\n“Surely, most reverend father,” answered the Preceptor, “I have not\nrisen to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most\nimportant prohibitions.”\n\n“How comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered\na brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish sorceress,\ninto this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?”\n\n“A Jewish sorceress!” echoed Albert Malvoisin; “good angels guard us!”\n\n“Ay, brother, a Jewish sorceress!” said the Grand Master, sternly. “I\nhave said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that\nwretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch\nMiriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy\nPreceptory?”\n\n“Your wisdom, reverend father,” answered the Preceptor, “hath rolled\naway the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good\na knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the\ncharms of this female, whom I received into this house merely to place a\nbar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented\nat the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother.”\n\n“Hath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?”\n demanded the Grand Master.\n\n“What! under this roof?” said the Preceptor, crossing himself; “Saint\nMagdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!--No! if I have sinned in\nreceiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus break\noff our brother's besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed to me\nso wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of\ninsanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since your reverend\nwisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it\nmay account fully for his enamoured folly.”\n\n“It doth!--it doth!” said Beaumanoir. “See, brother Conrade, the peril\nof yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan! We look\nupon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure\nin what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion,\nobtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work\nwhich was begun by idleness and folly. It may be that our brother\nBois-Guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe\nchastisement; rather the support of the staff, than the strokes of the\nrod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly,\nand restore him to his brethren.”\n\n“It were deep pity,” said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, “to lose to the Order\none of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid of\nits sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain\nwith his own hand.”\n\n“The blood of these accursed dogs,” said the Grand Master, “shall be a\nsweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise\nand blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and\ncharms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall burst\nthe bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which\nthe Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even\nheaps upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath flung her\nenchantments over a brother of the Holy Temple, assuredly she shall die\nthe death.”\n\n“But the laws of England,”--said the Preceptor, who, though delighted\nthat the Grand Master's resentment, thus fortunately averted from\nhimself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to\nfear he was carrying it too far.\n\n“The laws of England,” interrupted Beaumanoir, “permit and enjoin each\njudge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most petty\nbaron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain.\nAnd shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within\na preceptory of his Order?--No!--we will judge and condemn. The witch\nshall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be\nforgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.”\n\nAlbert Malvoisin bowed and retired,--not to give directions for\npreparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and\ncommunicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not\nlong ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had\nanew sustained from the fair Jewess. “The unthinking,” he said, “the\nungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved\nher life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until\nroof and rafters crackled and crashed around me. I was the butt of a\nhundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against\na latticed casement, and the only use I made of my shield was for her\nprotection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl\nupbraids me that I did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only\nthe slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that\never she will be brought to grant any. The devil, that possessed her\nrace with obstinacy, has concentrated its full force in her single\nperson!”\n\n“The devil,” said the Preceptor, “I think, possessed you both. How oft\nhave I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell you\nthat there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who\nwould think it sin to refuse so brave a knight 'le don d'amoureux\nmerci', and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate\nJewess! By the mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when he\nmaintains she hath cast a spell over you.”\n\n“Lucas Beaumanoir!”--said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully--“Are these your\nprecautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that\nRebecca is in the Preceptory?”\n\n“How could I help it?” said the Preceptor. “I neglected nothing that\ncould keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the\ndevil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I\ncould; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied--the victim\nof magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.”\n\n“She shall not, by Heaven!” said Bois-Guilbert.\n\n“By Heaven, she must and will!” said Malvoisin. “Neither you nor any\none else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of\na Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous\nindulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the\npower and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.”\n\n“Will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!” said\nBois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.\n\n“What they may believe, I know not,” said Malvoisin, calmly; “but I know\nwell, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to the\nhundred, will cry 'amen' to the Grand Master's sentence.”\n\n“I have it,” said Bois-Guilbert. “Albert, thou art my friend. Thou must\nconnive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some place\nof greater security and secrecy.”\n\n“I cannot, if I would,” replied the Preceptor; “the mansion is filled\nwith the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted to\nhim. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you\nin this matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have\nrisked enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a\nsentence of degradation, or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake\nof a painted piece of Jewish flesh and blood. And you, if you will be\nguided by my counsel, will give up this wild-goose chase, and fly your\nhawk at some other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,--thy present rank, thy\nfuture honours, all depend on thy place in the Order. Shouldst thou\nadhere perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give\nBeaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He\nis jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and\nhe knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will\nruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of\na Jewish sorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst\nnot control him. When the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest\ncaress the daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own\nhumour.”\n\n“Malvoisin,” said Bois-Guilbert, “thou art a cold-blooded--”\n\n“Friend,” said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which\nBois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,--“a cold-blooded\nfriend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I tell thee\nonce more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once more,\nthou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master--throw\nthyself at his feet and tell him--”\n\n“Not at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard's very beard will I\nsay--”\n\n“Say to him, then, to his beard,” continued Malvoisin, coolly, “that you\nlove this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost enlarge\non thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of\nthe fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by the avowal\nof a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren,\nand must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to\nlift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between\nFlanders and Burgundy.”\n\n“Thou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after\na moment's reflection. “I will give the hoary bigot no advantage over\nme; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should\nexpose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast her off--yes, I will\nleave her to her fate, unless--”\n\n“Qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,” said Malvoisin; “women\nare but the toys which amuse our lighter hours--ambition is the serious\nbusiness of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this Jewess,\nbefore thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched\nbefore thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close\nconversation--I must order the hall for his judgment-seat.”\n\n“What!” said Bois-Guilbert, “so soon?”\n\n“Ay,” replied the Preceptor, “trial moves rapidly on when the judge has\ndetermined the sentence beforehand.”\n\n“Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, “thou art like\nto cost me dear--Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm\nhypocrite recommends?--One effort will I make to save thee--but beware\nof ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my\nlove. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where\ncontempt and reproaches are his only reward.”\n\nThe Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined\nby Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Master's\nresolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.\n\n“It is surely a dream,” said the Preceptor; “we have many Jewish\nphysicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful\ncures.”\n\n“The Grand Master thinks otherwise,” said Mont-Fitchet; “and, Albert,\nI will be upright with thee--wizard or not, it were better that this\nmiserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to\nthe Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest his\nhigh rank, his fame in arms--thou knowest the zeal with which many of\nour brethren regard him--but all this will not avail him with our Grand\nMaster, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of\nthis Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it\nwere better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in\nher destruction.”\n\n“I have been working him even now to abandon her,” said Malvoisin;\n“but still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for\nsorcery?--Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that\nthe proofs are so weak?”\n\n“They must be strengthened, Albert,” replied Mont-Fitchet, “they must be\nstrengthened. Dost thou understand me?”\n\n“I do,” said the Preceptor, “nor do I scruple to do aught for\nadvancement of the Order--but there is little time to find engines\nfitting.”\n\n“Malvoisin, they MUST be found,” said Conrade; “well will it advantage\nboth the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor Preceptory--that of\nMaison-Dieu is worth double its value--thou knowest my interest with our\nold Chief--find those who can carry this matter through, and thou art\nPreceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent--How sayst thou?”\n\n“There is,” replied Malvoisin, “among those who came hither with\nBois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my\nbrother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of\nFront-de-Boeuf--It may be they know something of the witcheries of this\nwoman.”\n\n“Away, seek them out instantly--and hark thee, if a byzant or two will\nsharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.”\n\n“They would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,”\n said the Preceptor.\n\n“Away, then,” said Mont-Fitchet; “at noon the affair will proceed. I\nhave not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned\nto the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.”\n\nThe ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca\nheard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place\nof confinement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and\nthe circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the\nsolitary visits of the fierce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of\nany evil that could befall her besides. The door of the chamber was\nunlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by\nfour warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.\n\n“Daughter of an accursed race!” said the Preceptor, “arise and follow\nus.”\n\n“Whither,” said Rebecca, “and for what purpose?”\n\n“Damsel,” answered Conrade, “it is not for thee to question, but to\nobey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought\nbefore the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to\nanswer for thine offences.”\n\n“May the God of Abraham be praised!” said Rebecca, folding her hands\ndevoutly; “the name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me\nas the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee--permit me\nonly to wrap my veil around my head.”\n\nThey descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long\ngallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the\ngreat hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his\ncourt of justice.\n\nThe lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and\nyeomen, who made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended\nby the Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of\nhalberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her. As she\npassed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a\nscrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she received almost\nunconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents. The\nassurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave\nher courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she had\nbeen conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon the scene, which we shall\nendeavour to describe in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n     Stern was the law which bade its vot'ries leave\n     At human woes with human hearts to grieve;\n     Stern was the law, which at the winning wile\n     Of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;\n     But sterner still, when high the iron-rod\n     Of tyrant power she shook, and call'd that power of God.\n     --The Middle Ages\n\nThe Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca,\noccupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall--a\nplatform, which we have already described as the place of honour,\ndestined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests\nof an ancient mansion.\n\nOn an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master\nof the Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his\nhand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet\nwas placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order,\nwhose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day.\nThe black dresses, bare scalps, and demure looks of these church-men,\nformed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who\nattended, either as residing in the Preceptory, or as come thither to\nattend upon their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom there were four\npresent, occupied seats lower in height, and somewhat drawn back behind\nthat of their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed no such rank in\nthe Order, were placed on benches still lower, and preserving the same\ndistance from the Preceptors as these from the Grand Master. Behind\nthem, but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall, stood the\nesquires of the Order, in white dresses of an inferior quality.\n\nThe whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in\nthe faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring,\nunited with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession,\nand which, in the presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit upon\nevery brow.\n\nThe remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards, holding\npartisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither,\nto see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater\npart of those inferior persons were, in one rank or other, connected\nwith the Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their black\ndresses. But peasants from the neighbouring country were not refused\nadmittance; for it was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the edifying\nspectacle of the justice which he administered as public as possible.\nHis large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly,\nand his countenance appeared elated by the conscious dignity, and\nimaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A psalm,\nwhich he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age had not\ndeprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day; and the\nsolemn sounds, “Venite exultemus Domino”, so often sung by the Templars\nbefore engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged by Lucas most\nappropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed\nit, over the powers of darkness. The deep prolonged notes, raised by\na hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant,\narose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolled on amongst its arches\nwith the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters.\n\nWhen the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around\nthe circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was\nvacant. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left\nhis place, and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the\nbenches occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand\nextending his long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face;\nwhile the other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which,\nsheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.\n\n“Unhappy man!” said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance\nof compassion. “Thou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses him.\nTo this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers\nof this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!--Seest thou he cannot\nlook upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse\nfrom his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the\nfloor?--It may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at\nand defy the foul enemy. 'Semper Leo percutiatur!'”\n\nThis was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade\nMont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the\nassembly.\n\n“Reverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this\nHoly Order, my brethren and my children!--you also, well-born and pious\nEsquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!--and you also, Christian\nbrethren, of every degree!--Be it known to you, that it is not defect of\npower in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation;\nfor, however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed, with this\nbatoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of\nthis our Holy Order. Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly and\nreligious profession, hath said, in the fifty-ninth capital, [53] that\nhe would not that brethren be called together in council, save at the\nwill and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those more\nworthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office, to judge, as\nwell of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of the\nwhole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all such\nchapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to\nproceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath\nmade an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is\nthe duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with\nbows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known\nrule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have therefore\nsummoned to our presence a Jewish woman, by name Rebecca, daughter\nof Isaac of York--a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries;\nwhereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a\nchurl, but of a Knight--not of a secular Knight, but of one devoted\nto the service of the Holy Temple--not of a Knight Companion, but of a\nPreceptor of our Order, first in honour as in place. Our brother, Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now\nhear me, as a true and zealous champion of the Cross, by whose arm many\ndeeds of valour have been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy places\npurified from pollution by the blood of those infidels who defiled them.\nNeither have our brother's sagacity and prudence been less in repute\namong his brethren than his valour and discipline; in so much, that\nknights, both in eastern and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert\nas one who may well be put in nomination as successor to this batoon,\nwhen it shall please Heaven to release us from the toil of bearing\nit. If we were told that such a man, so honoured, and so honourable,\nsuddenly casting away regard for his character, his vows, his brethren,\nand his prospects, had associated to himself a Jewish damsel, wandered\nin this lewd company, through solitary places, defended her person in\npreference to his own, and, finally, was so utterly blinded and besotted\nby his folly, as to bring her even to one of our own Preceptories,\nwhat should we say but that the noble knight was possessed by some\nevil demon, or influenced by some wicked spell?--If we could suppose\nit otherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any earthly\nconsideration, should prevent us from visiting him with punishment, that\nthe evil thing might be removed, even according to the text, 'Auferte\nmalum ex vobis'. For various and heinous are the acts of transgression\nagainst the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable history.--1st,\nHe hath walked according to his proper will, contrary to capital 33,\n'Quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedat'.--2d, He hath held\ncommunication with an excommunicated person, capital 57, 'Ut fratres\nnon participent cum excommunicatis', and therefore hath a portion\nin 'Anathema Maranatha'.--3d, He hath conversed with strange women,\ncontrary to the capital, 'Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis\nmulieribus'.--4th, He hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be\nfeared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of\nour renowned Order, 'Ut fugiantur oscula', the soldiers of the Cross are\nbrought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de\nBois-Guilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation, were\nhe the right hand and right eye thereof.”\n\nHe paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger\npart, who had been inclined to smile at the statute 'De osculis\nfugiendis', became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand\nMaster was next to propose.\n\n“Such,” he said, “and so great should indeed be the punishment of a\nKnight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his Order in\nsuch weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan had\nobtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his eyes\ntoo lightly upon a damsel's beauty, we are then rather to lament than\nchastise his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance as\nmay purify him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of\nour indignation upon the accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh\noccasioned his utter falling away.--Stand forth, therefore, and bear\nwitness, ye who have witnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge\nof the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be\nsatisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must\ngo on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our\nbrother.”\n\nSeveral witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which\nBois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the\nblazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to\nher safety. The men gave these details with the exaggerations common to\nvulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event,\nand their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased\nby the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent\nperson for whose information it had been delivered. Thus the dangers\nwhich Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently great, became\nportentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight to Rebecca's\ndefence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of discretion, but\neven of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference\nto what she said, even although her language was often severe and\nupbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his\nhaughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.\n\nThe Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner\nin which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The\nevidence of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently\nstudied to spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time\nto time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some\ntemporary alienation of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of\nthe damsel whom he brought along with him. With sighs of penitence, the\nPreceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and\nher lover within the walls of the Preceptory--“But my defence,” he\nconcluded, “has been made in my confession to our most reverend father\nthe Grand Master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct\nmay have been irregular. Joyfully will I submit to any penance he shall\nassign me.”\n\n“Thou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,” said Beaumanoir; “thy motives\nwere good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring\nbrother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong;\nas he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup\ninstead of the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of\naccomplishing his purpose. Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our\npious founder for matins, and nine for vespers; be those services\ndoubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars permitted the use of flesh;\nbut do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This do for six weeks to\ncome, and thy penance is accomplished.”\n\nWith a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of\nTemplestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his\nseat.\n\n“Were it not well, brethren,” said the Grand Master, “that we examine\nsomething into the former life and conversation of this woman, specially\nthat we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms\nand spells, since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to\nsuppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted\nupon by some infernal enticement and delusion?”\n\nHerman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other\nthree were Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an\nancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the\nsabre of the Moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his\nbrethren. He arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted\nhim license of speech. “I would crave to know, most Reverend Father,\nof our valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these\nwondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his\nunhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?”\n\n“Brian de Bois-Guilbert,” said the Grand Master, “thou hearest the\nquestion which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer.\nI command thee to reply to him.”\n\nBois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus\naddressed, and remained silent.\n\n“He is possessed by a dumb devil,” said the Grand Master. “Avoid thee,\nSathanus!--Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee, by this symbol\nof our Holy Order.”\n\nBois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and\nindignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would have\nlittle availed him. “Brian de Bois-Guilbert,” he answered, “replies not,\nmost Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If his honour be\nimpeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that sword which\nhas often fought for Christendom.”\n\n“We forgive thee, Brother Brian,” said the Grand Master; “though that\nthou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a glorifying of\nthine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our\nown worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less of\nthine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven's\nleave, we will quell and drive forth from our assembly.” A glance of\ndisdain flashed from the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made\nno reply.--“And now,” pursued the Grand Master, “since our Brother of\nGoodalricke's question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we our\nquest, brethren, and with our patron's assistance, we will search to the\nbottom this mystery of iniquity.--Let those who have aught to witness of\nthe life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth before us.”\n There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when the Grand\nMaster enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a\nbedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his\nlimbs, by a miraculous balsam.\n\nThe poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar,\nterrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the\nguilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly\ncured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on crutches\nto give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many\ntears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at York, he\nwas suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring for Isaac\nthe rich Jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to\nstir from his bed until the remedies applied by Rebecca's directions,\nand especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree\nrestored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she had given\nhim a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of\nmoney withal, to return to the house of his father, near to Templestowe.\n“And may it please your gracious Reverence,” said the man, “I cannot\nthink the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a\nJewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed,\nand it never operated a whit less kindly--”\n\n“Peace, slave,” said the Grand Master, “and begone! It well suits brutes\nlike thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and to be\ngiving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the fiend can\nimpose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in order to bring\ninto credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of\nwhich thou speakest?”\n\nThe peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a\nsmall box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with\nmost of the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary.\nBeaumanoir, after crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and,\nlearned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the\nlid,--“The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.”\n\n“Strange powers of Sathanas.” said he, “which can convert Scripture into\nblasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!--Is there no leech\nhere who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?”\n\nTwo mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other\na barber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials,\nexcepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to\nbe Oriental herbs. But with the true professional hatred to a successful\npractitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the medicine was\nbeyond their own knowledge, it must necessarily have been compounded\nfrom an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they themselves, though\nno conjurors, fully understood every branch of their art, so far as it\nmight be exercised with the good faith of a Christian. When this medical\nresearch was ended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the\nmedicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frowned\nseverely at the request. “What is thy name, fellow?” said he to the\ncripple.\n\n“Higg, the son of Snell,” answered the peasant.\n\n“Then Higg, son of Snell,” said the Grand Master, “I tell thee it is\nbetter to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of unbelievers'\nmedicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil infidels\nof their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them benevolent\ngifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.”\n\n“Alack,” said the peasant, “an it shall not displease your Reverence,\nthe lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I will\ntell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that\nyour mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him\nfaithful service.”\n\n“Out with the prating villain!” said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared to\nrefute this practical application of his general maxim.\n\nHigg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the\nfate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even\nat the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the\nterror of which withered his very heart within him.\n\nAt this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to\nunveil herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied\npatiently, but with dignity,--“That it was not the wont of the daughters\nof her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of\nstrangers.” The sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her\nreply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. But\nBeaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity\nwhich could interfere with his imagined duty, was a virtue of itself,\nrepeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The guards\nwere about to remove her veil accordingly, when she stood up before\nthe Grand Master and said, “Nay, but for the love of your own\ndaughters--Alas,” she said, recollecting herself, “ye have no\ndaughters!--yet for the remembrance of your mothers--for the love of\nyour sisters, and of female decency, let me not be thus handled in your\npresence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I\nwill obey you,” she added, with an expression of patient sorrow in her\nvoice, which had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; “ye are\nelders among your people, and at your command I will show the features\nof an ill-fated maiden.”\n\nShe withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which\nbashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a\nmurmur of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their\neyes, in silent correspondence, that Brian's best apology was in the\npower of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But\nHigg, the son of Snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the\nsight of the countenance of his benefactress.\n\n“Let me go forth,” he said to the warders at the door of the hall,--“let\nme go forth!--To look at her again will kill me, for I have had a share\nin murdering her.”\n\n“Peace, poor man,” said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; “thou\nhast done me no harm by speaking the truth--thou canst not aid me by\nthy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee--go home and save\nthyself.”\n\nHigg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders,\nwho were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them\nreprehension, and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent,\nand was permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert\nMalvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their\ntestimony, were now called forward. Though both were hardened and\ninflexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as well as her\nexcelling beauty, at first appeared to stagger them; but an expressive\nglance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their dogged\ncomposure; and they delivered, with a precision which would have seemed\nsuspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether\nfictitious or trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant\nwith suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and\nthe sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. The\ncircumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days, divided\ninto two classes--those which were immaterial, and those which were\nactually and physically impossible. But both were, in those ignorant\nand superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of guilt.--The first\nclass set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter to herself in an\nunknown tongue--that the songs she sung by fits were of a strangely\nsweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and his heart\nthrob--that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward\nfor a reply--that her garments were of a strange and mystic form,\nunlike those of women of good repute--that she had rings impressed with\ncabalistical devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her\nveil.\n\nAll these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely\nlistened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that\nRebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.\n\nBut there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of\nthe assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however\nincredible. One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded\nman, brought with them to the castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said,\nmake certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious\nwords, which he blessed God he understood not, when the iron head of a\nsquare cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding was\nstanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a quarter\nof an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in\nmanaging a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This legend was\nprobably founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the\nwounded Ivanhoe when in the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the\nmore difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to\nproduce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony, he drew from\nhis pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been\nmiraculously extracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full\nounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however marvellous.\n\nHis comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the\nscene betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of\nprecipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his\ncompanion, this fellow stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself\nupon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white\nswan, under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of\nTorquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the\nfemale form.\n\nLess than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient\nto convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a\nJewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too\nweighty for Rebecca's youth, though combined with the most exquisite\nbeauty.\n\nThe Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn\ntone demanded of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of\ncondemnation, which he was about to pronounce.\n\n“To invoke your pity,” said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat\ntremulous with emotion, “would, I am aware, be as useless as I should\nhold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another\nreligion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our\nfaiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men\n(whom may Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would\navail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still\nless would it advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my\ndress, language, and manners, are those of my people--I had well-nigh\nsaid of my country, but alas! we have no country. Nor will I even\nvindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there\nlistening to the fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant\ninto the victim.--God be judge between him and me! but rather would I\nsubmit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me,\nthan listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon\nme--friendless, defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own\nfaith, and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn\nprotestations of the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to\nhimself the charge brought against me--but to himself--Yes, Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not\nfalse? as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?”\n\nThere was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was\nsilent.\n\n“Speak,” she said, “if thou art a man--if thou art a Christian,\nspeak!--I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by the name\nthou dost inherit--by the knighthood thou dost vaunt--by the honour of\nthy mother--by the tomb and the bones of thy father--I conjure thee to\nsay, are these things true?”\n\n“Answer her, brother,” said the Grand Master, “if the Enemy with whom\nthou dost wrestle will give thee power.”\n\nIn fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which\nalmost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that\nat last he replied, looking to Rebecca,--“The scroll!--the scroll!”\n\n“Ay,” said Beaumanoir, “this is indeed testimony! The victim of her\nwitcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which\nis, doubtless, the cause of his silence.”\n\nBut Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were\nfrom Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment\nwhich she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in\nthe Arabian character, “Demand a Champion!” The murmuring commentary\nwhich ran through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert,\ngave Rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll\nunobserved. When the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.\n\n“Rebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy\nknight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too powerful.\nHast thou aught else to say?”\n\n“There is yet one chance of life left to me,” said Rebecca, “even by\nyour own fierce laws. Life has been miserable--miserable, at least, of\nlate--but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me the\nmeans of defending it. I deny this charge--I maintain my innocence, and\nI declare the falsehood of this accusation--I challenge the privilege of\ntrial by combat, and will appear by my champion.”\n\n“And who, Rebecca,” replied the Grand Master, “will lay lance in rest\nfor a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?”\n\n“God will raise me up a champion,” said Rebecca--“It cannot be that in\nmerry England--the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so many are\nready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one\nto fight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by\ncombat--there lies my gage.”\n\nShe took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before\nthe Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which\nexcited universal surprise and admiration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n     ---There I throw my gage,\n     To prove it on thee to the extremest point\n     Of martial daring.\n     --Richard II\n\nEven Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance\nof Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but\nwith passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of\nduty, his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he\npursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity\nof subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he conceived\npeculiarly incumbent on him. His features relaxed in their usual\nseverity as he gazed upon the beautiful creature before him, alone,\nunfriended, and defending herself with so much spirit and courage. He\ncrossed himself twice, as doubting whence arose the unwonted softening\nof a heart, which on such occasions used to resemble in hardness the\nsteel of his sword. At length he spoke.\n\n“Damsel,” he said, “if the pity I feel for thee arise from any practice\nthine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I rather judge\nit the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form\nshould be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter--confess thy\nwitchcrafts--turn thee from thine evil faith--embrace this holy\nemblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. In some\nsisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and\nfitting penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. This do and\nlive--what has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die\nfor it?”\n\n“It was the law of my fathers,” said Rebecca; “it was delivered in\nthunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud and in fire.\nThis, if ye are Christians, ye believe--it is, you say, recalled; but so\nmy teachers have not taught me.”\n\n“Let our chaplain,” said Beaumanoir, “stand forth, and tell this\nobstinate infidel--”\n\n“Forgive the interruption,” said Rebecca, meekly; “I am a maiden,\nunskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it be\nGod's will.--Let me pray your answer to my demand of a champion.”\n\n“Give me her glove,” said Beaumanoir. “This is indeed,” he continued, as\nhe looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, “a slight and frail\ngage for a purpose so deadly!--Seest thou, Rebecca, as this thin and\nlight glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so is\nthy cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast\ndefied.”\n\n“Cast my innocence into the scale,” answered Rebecca, “and the glove of\nsilk shall outweigh the glove of iron.”\n\n“Then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that\nbold challenge which thou hast made?”\n\n“I do persist, noble sir,” answered Rebecca.\n\n“So be it then, in the name of Heaven,” said the Grand Master; “and may\nGod show the right!”\n\n“Amen,” replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply\nechoed by the whole assembly.\n\n“Brethren,” said Beaumanoir, “you are aware that we might well have\nrefused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat--but though a\nJewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and\nGod forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it\nshould be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well\nas men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to\nrefuse proffered combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca,\nthe daughter of Isaac of York, is, by many frequent and suspicious\ncircumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble\nknight of our holy Order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her\ninnocence. To whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should\ndeliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our\nchampion on the field?”\n\n“To Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,” said the\nPreceptor of Goodalricke, “and who, moreover, best knows how the truth\nstands in this matter.”\n\n“But if,” said the Grand Master, “our brother Brian be under the\ninfluence of a charm or a spell--we speak but for the sake of\nprecaution, for to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more\nwillingly confide this or a more weighty cause.”\n\n“Reverend father,” answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, “no spell can\neffect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of God.”\n\n“Thou sayest right, brother,” said the Grand Master. “Albert Malvoisin,\ngive this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.--It is our charge to\nthee, brother,” he continued, addressing himself to Bois-Guilbert, “that\nthou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause shall\ntriumph.--And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third\nday from the present to find a champion.”\n\n“That is but brief space,” answered Rebecca, “for a stranger, who is\nalso of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life\nand honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved\nsoldier.”\n\n“We may not extend it,” answered the Grand Master; “the field must be\nfoughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the\nfourth day from hence.”\n\n“God's will be done!” said Rebecca; “I put my trust in Him, to whom an\ninstant is as effectual to save as a whole age.”\n\n“Thou hast spoken well, damsel,” said the Grand Master; “but well know\nwe who can array himself like an angel of light. It remains but to name\na fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.--Where\nis the Preceptor of this house?”\n\nAlbert Malvoisin, still holding Rebecca's glove in his hand, was\nspeaking to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.\n\n“How!” said the Grand Master, “will he not receive the gage?”\n\n“He will--he doth, most Reverend Father,” said Malvoisin, slipping the\nglove under his own mantle. “And for the place of combat, I hold the\nfittest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory,\nand used by us for military exercise.”\n\n“It is well,” said the Grand Master.--“Rebecca, in those lists shalt\nthou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thy\nchampion shall be discomfited by the judgment of God, thou shalt then\ndie the death of a sorceress, according to doom.--Let this our judgment\nbe recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend\nignorance.”\n\nOne of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately\nengrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of\nthe Templar Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when\nhe had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the Grand\nMaster, which, when translated from the Norman-French in which it was\ncouched, was expressed as follows.--\n\n“Rebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of\nsorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a Knight\nof the most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and\nsaith, that the testimony delivered against her this day is false,\nwicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful 'essoine' [54] of her body as\nbeing unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion\ninstead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal 'devoir' in\nall knightly sort, with such arms as to gage of battle do fully\nappertain, and that at her peril and cost. And therewith she proffered\nher gage. And the gage having been delivered to the noble Lord and\nKnight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion,\nhe was appointed to do this battle, in behalf of his Order and himself,\nas injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant. Wherefore the\nmost reverend Father and puissant Lord, Lucas Marquis of Beaumanoir, did\nallow of the said challenge, and of the said 'essoine' of the\nappellant's body, and assigned the third day for the said combat, the\nplace being the enclosure called the lists of Saint George, near to the\nPreceptory of Templestowe. And the Grand Master appoints the appellant\nto appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a person convicted\nof sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to appear, under the\npenalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default; and the\nnoble Lord and most reverend Father aforesaid appointed the battle to be\ndone in his own presence, and according to all that is commendable and\nprofitable in such a case. And may God aid the just cause!”\n\n“Amen!” said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all around.\nRebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,\nremained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly\nreminded the Grand Master, that she ought to be permitted some\nopportunity of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of\nmaking her condition known to them, and procuring, if possible, some\nchampion to fight in her behalf.\n\n“It is just and lawful,” said the Grand Master; “choose what messenger\nthou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication with thee in thy\nprison-chamber.”\n\n“Is there,” said Rebecca, “any one here, who, either for love of a good\ncause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed being?”\n\nAll were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand\nMaster, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he\nshould be suspected of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect of\nreward, far less any feelings of compassion alone, could surmount this\napprehension.\n\nRebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then\nexclaimed, “Is it really thus?--And, in English land, am I to be\ndeprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of\nan act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal?”\n\nHigg, the son of Snell, at length replied, “I am but a maimed man,\nbut that I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable\nassistance.--I will do thine errand,” he added, addressing Rebecca, “as\nwell as a crippled object can, and happy were my limbs fleet enough\nto repair the mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy\ncharity, I little thought I was leading thee into danger!”\n\n“God,” said Rebecca, “is the disposer of all. He can turn back the\ncaptivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his\nmessage the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac\nof York--here is that will pay for horse and man--let him have this\nscroll.--I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me,\nbut most truly do I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a\nchampion will be raised up for me. Farewell!--Life and death are in thy\nhaste.”\n\nThe peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in Hebrew.\nMany of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a document so\nsuspicious; but Higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress.\nShe had saved his body, he said, and he was confident she did not mean\nto peril his soul.\n\n“I will get me,” he said, “my neighbour Buthan's good capul, [55] and I\nwill be at York within as brief space as man and beast may.”\n\nBut as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a\nquarter of a mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with two\nriders, whom, by their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be\nJews; and, on approaching more nearly, discovered that one of them was\nhis ancient employer, Isaac of York. The other was the Rabbi Ben Samuel;\nand both had approached as near to the Preceptory as they dared, on\nhearing that the Grand Master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a\nsorceress.\n\n“Brother Ben Samuel,” said Isaac, “my soul is disquieted, and I wot not\nwhy. This charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil\npractices on our people.”\n\n“Be of good comfort, brother,” said the physician; “thou canst deal with\nthe Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness, and canst\ntherefore purchase immunity at their hands--it rules the savage minds of\nthose ungodly men, even as the signet of the mighty Solomon was said\nto command the evil genii.--But what poor wretch comes hither upon his\ncrutches, desiring, as I think, some speech of me?--Friend,” continued\nthe physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, “I refuse thee not the\naid of mine art, but I relieve not with one asper those who beg for alms\nupon the highway. Out upon thee!--Hast thou the palsy in thy legs? then\nlet thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit thou be'st unfit for\na speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for the warfare, or for the\nservice of a hasty master, yet there be occupations--How now, brother?”\n said he, interrupting his harangue to look towards Isaac, who had but\nglanced at the scroll which Higg offered, when, uttering a deep groan,\nhe fell from his mule like a dying man, and lay for a minute insensible.\n\nThe Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the\nremedies which his art suggested for the recovery of his companion. He\nhad even taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about\nto proceed to phlebotomy, when the object of his anxious solicitude\nsuddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to throw\ndust on his grey hairs. The physician was at first inclined to ascribe\nthis sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity; and,\nadhering to his original purpose, began once again to handle his\nimplements. But Isaac soon convinced him of his error.\n\n“Child of my sorrow,” he said, “well shouldst thou be called Benoni,\ninstead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to the\ngrave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!”\n\n“Brother,” said the Rabbi, in great surprise, “art thou a father in\nIsrael, and dost thou utter words like unto these?--I trust that the\nchild of thy house yet liveth?”\n\n“She liveth,” answered Isaac; “but it is as Daniel, who was called\nBeltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She is captive\nunto those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her,\nsparing neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O! she was as a\ncrown of green palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night,\nlike the gourd of Jonah!--Child of my love!--child of my old age!--oh,\nRebecca, daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath\nencompassed thee.”\n\n“Yet read the scroll,” said the Rabbi; “peradventure it may be that we\nmay yet find out a way of deliverance.”\n\n“Do thou read, brother,” answered Isaac, “for mine eyes are as a\nfountain of water.”\n\nThe physician read, but in their native language, the following words:--\n\n“To Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York,\npeace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!--My\nfather, I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth\nnot--even for the crime of witchcraft. My father, if a strong man can be\nfound to do battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the\ncustom of the Nazarenes, and that within the lists of Templestowe, on\nthe third day from this time, peradventure our fathers' God will give\nhim strength to defend the innocent, and her who hath none to help her.\nBut if this may not be, let the virgins of our people mourn for me as\nfor one cast off, and for the hart that is stricken by the hunter, and\nfor the flower which is cut down by the scythe of the mower. Wherefore\nlook now what thou doest, and whether there be any rescue. One Nazarene\nwarrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf, even Wilfred, son of\nCedric, whom the Gentiles call Ivanhoe. But he may not yet endure\nthe weight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the tidings unto him, my\nfather; for he hath favour among the strong men of his people, and as\nhe was our companion in the house of bondage, he may find some one to do\nbattle for my sake. And say unto him, even unto him, even unto Wilfred,\nthe son of Cedric, that if Rebecca live, or if Rebecca die, she liveth\nor dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal. And if it be\nthe will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter, do not\nthou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty; but betake\nthyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, under the shadow\nof the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen; for less\ncruel are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob, than the\ncruelties of the Nazarenes of England.”\n\nIsaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the\nletter, and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of Oriental\nsorrow, tearing his garments, besprinkling his head with dust, and\nejaculating, “My daughter! my daughter! flesh of my flesh, and bone of\nmy bone!”\n\n“Yet,” said the Rabbi, “take courage, for this grief availeth nothing.\nGird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. It may\nbe he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath\nfavour in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes Coeur-de-Lion,\nand the tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may\nbe that he may obtain his letter, and his signet, commanding these men\nof blood, who take their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof,\nthat they proceed not in their purposed wickedness.”\n\n“I will seek him out,” said Isaac, “for he is a good youth, and hath\ncompassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour, and\nwhat other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?”\n\n“Nay, but,” said the Rabbi, “thou speakest as one that knoweth not the\nGentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as with gold thou\nbuyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward to\nfind out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up and be doing, for great\nsin it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the city of\nYork, where many warriors and strong men are assembled, and doubt not I\nwill find among them some one who will do battle for thy daughter; for\ngold is their god, and for riches will they pawn their lives as well as\ntheir lands.--Thou wilt fulfil, my brother, such promise as I may make\nunto them in thy name?”\n\n“Assuredly, brother,” said Isaac, “and Heaven be praised that raised me\nup a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not their full demand\nat once, for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people that\nthey will ask pounds, and peradventure accept of ounces--Nevertheless,\nbe it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this thing, and what would\nmy gold avail me if the child of my love should perish!”\n\n“Farewell,” said the physician, “and may it be to thee as thy heart\ndesireth.”\n\nThey embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The\ncrippled peasant remained for some time looking after them.\n\n“These dog-Jews!” said he; “to take no more notice of a free\nguild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcised\nHebrew like themselves! They might have flung me a mancus or two,\nhowever. I was not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls, and run\nthe risk of being bewitched, as more folks than one told me. And what\ncare I for the bit of gold that the wench gave me, if I am to come to\nharm from the priest next Easter at confession, and be obliged to give\nhim twice as much to make it up with him, and be called the Jew's\nflying post all my life, as it may hap, into the bargain? I think I was\nbewitched in earnest when I was beside that girl!--But it was always so\nwith Jew or Gentile, whosoever came near her--none could stay when she\nhad an errand to go--and still, whenever I think of her, I would give\nshop and tools to save her life.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n     O maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,\n     My bosom is proud as thine own.\n     --Seward\n\nIt was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be\ncalled such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door\nof Rebecca's prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then\nengaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which\nconcluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English.\n\n     When Israel, of the Lord beloved,\n     Out of the land of bondage came,\n     Her father's God before her moved,\n     An awful guide, in smoke and flame.\n     By day, along the astonish'd lands\n     The cloudy pillar glided slow;\n     By night, Arabia's crimson'd sands\n     Return'd the fiery column's glow.\n\n     There rose the choral hymn of praise,\n     And trump and timbrel answer'd keen,\n     And Zion's daughters pour'd their lays,\n     With priest's and warrior's voice between.\n     No portents now our foes amaze,\n     Forsaken Israel wanders lone;\n     Our fathers would not know THY ways,\n     And THOU hast left them to their own.\n\n     But, present still, though now unseen;\n     When brightly shines the prosperous day,\n     Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen\n     To temper the deceitful ray.\n     And oh, when stoops on Judah's path\n     In shade and storm the frequent night,\n     Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,\n     A burning, and a shining light!\n\n     Our harps we left by Babel's streams,\n     The tyrant's jest, the Gentile's scorn;\n     No censer round our altar beams,\n     And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.\n     But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,\n     The flesh of rams, I will not prize;\n     A contrite heart, and humble thought,\n     Are mine accepted sacrifice.\n\nWhen the sounds of Rebecca's devotional hymn had died away in silence,\nthe low knock at the door was again renewed. “Enter,” she said, “if\nthou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy\nentrance.”\n\n“I am,” said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, “friend or\nfoe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.”\n\nAlarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she\nconsidered as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with\na cautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest\ncorner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she\ncould, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible.\nShe drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution,\nas one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it,\nbeing offered, to the utmost of her power.\n\n“You have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,” said the Templar; “or if I\nmust so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to fear me.”\n\n“I fear you not, Sir Knight,” replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn\nbreath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; “my trust is strong,\nand I fear thee not.”\n\n“You have no cause,” answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; “my former frantic\nattempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are guards, over\nwhom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death,\nRebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one, even by me,\nwere my frenzy--for frenzy it is--to urge me so far.”\n\n“May Heaven be praised!” said the Jewess; “death is the least of my\napprehensions in this den of evil.”\n\n“Ay,” replied the Templar, “the idea of death is easily received by the\ncourageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A thrust with a\nlance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little--To you, a spring from\na dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors,\ncompared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me--I say this--perhaps\nmine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, Rebecca, than\nthine are; but we know alike how to die for them.”\n\n“Unhappy man,” said the Jewess; “and art thou condemned to expose thy\nlife for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge\nthe solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which\nis not bread--but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate on the\nwild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the\nRock of Ages.”\n\n“Silence, maiden,” answered the Templar; “such discourse now avails but\nlittle. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as\nmisery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted\ncourse of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men\ncalls thy crime.”\n\n“And to whom--if such my fate--to whom do I owe this?” said Rebecca\n“surely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause, dragged\nme hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to\nexaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.”\n\n“Think not,” said the Templar, “that I have so exposed thee; I would\nhave bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as\never I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.”\n\n“Had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,” said\nRebecca, “I had thanked thee for thy care--as it is, thou hast claimed\nmerit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me,\npreserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.”\n\n“Truce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,” said the Templar; “I have my\nown cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it.”\n\n“What is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?” said the Jewess; “speak it\nbriefly.--If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou\nhast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to\nmyself--the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and I\nhave few moments to prepare for it.”\n\n“I perceive, Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, “that thou dost continue to\nburden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I have\nprevented.”\n\n“Sir Knight,” said Rebecca, “I would avoid reproaches--But what is more\ncertain than that I owe my death to thine unbridled passion?”\n\n“You err--you err,”--said the Templar, hastily, “if you impute what\nI could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.--Could I\nguess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of frantic\nvalour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid self-torments\nof an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above\ncommon sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our Order, who think\nand feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the\ngrounds of his opinions and actions?”\n\n“Yet,” said Rebecca, “you sate a judge upon me, innocent--most\ninnocent--as you knew me to be--you concurred in my condemnation, and,\nif I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my\nguilt, and assure my punishment.”\n\n“Thy patience, maiden,” replied the Templar. “No race knows so well as\nthine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark as\nto make advantage even of an adverse wind.”\n\n“Lamented be the hour,” said Rebecca, “that has taught such art to\nthe House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the\nstubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and\nthe denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before\nstrangers. It is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own\nmisdeeds and those of our fathers; but you--you who boast your freedom\nas your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to\nsoothe the prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?”\n\n“Your words are bitter, Rebecca,” said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the\napartment with impatience, “but I came not hither to bandy reproaches\nwith you.--Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although\ncircumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is\nthe mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside\nby the rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. That scroll\nwhich warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it\ncame, if not from Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou have excited\nsuch interest?”\n\n“A brief respite from instant death,” said Rebecca, “which will little\navail me--was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou hast\nheaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the\ntomb?”\n\n“No maiden,” said Bois-Guilbert, “this was NOT all that I purposed. Had\nit not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and\nthe fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and\njudge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the\nChampion Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion\nof the Order. Then I myself--such was my purpose--had, on the sounding\nof the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed\nin the fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his\nshield and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two\nor three of the brethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them\nout of the saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine\ninnocence have been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have\ntrusted for the reward of my victory.”\n\n“This, Sir Knight,” said Rebecca, “is but idle boasting--a brag of what\nyou would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise. You\nreceived my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can find\none, must encounter your lance in the lists--yet you would assume the\nair of my friend and protector!”\n\n“Thy friend and protector,” said the Templar, gravely, “I will yet\nbe--but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of dishonour;\nand then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all\nthat I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.”\n\n“Speak,” said Rebecca; “I understand thee not.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Bois-Guilbert, “I will speak as freely as ever\ndid doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky\nconfessional.--Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and\nrank--lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I mean,\nin which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding to\nthat mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard Lucas\nde Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such is my\ncertain doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause. Accursed be he\nof Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed Albert\nde Malvoisin, who withheld me from the resolution I had formed,\nof hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and\nsuperannuated fool, who listened to a charge so absurd, and against a\ncreature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!”\n\n“And what now avails rant or flattery?” answered Rebecca. “Thou hast\nmade thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent\nwoman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes--What\navails it to reckon together?--thy choice is made.”\n\n“No, Rebecca,” said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer\ntowards her; “my choice is NOT made--nay, mark, it is thine to make the\nelection. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms;\nand if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and\nfaggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on\nequal issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and his\nminion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear\nhis corslet, and Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou\ndiest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth\nto enter the lists in thy defence.”\n\n“And what avails repeating this so often?” said Rebecca.\n\n“Much,” replied the Templar; “for thou must learn to look at thy fate on\nevery side.”\n\n“Well, then, turn the tapestry,” said the Jewess, “and let me see the\nother side.”\n\n“If I appear,” said Bois-Guilbert, “in the fatal lists, thou diest by a\nslow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty\nhereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured\nknight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels--the\nillustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a\nhissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour, I lose the prospect\nof such greatness as scarce emperors attain to--I sacrifice mighty\nambition, I destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which\nheathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled--and yet, Rebecca,” he\nadded, throwing himself at her feet, “this greatness will I sacrifice,\nthis fame will I renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it\nis half within my grasp, if thou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee\nfor my lover.”\n\n“Think not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,” answered Rebecca, “but\nhasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John--they cannot,\nin honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand\nMaster. So shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part,\nor the pretext of requiring any requital from me.”\n\n“With these I deal not,” he continued, holding the train of her\nrobe--“it is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy\nchoice? Bethink thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is\ndeath who is my rival.”\n\n“I weigh not these evils,” said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild\nknight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even\nfeign to endure it. “Be a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith\nrecommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions\npretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital\nwhich would change thy magnanimity into base barter.”\n\n“No, damsel!” said the proud Templar, springing up, “thou shalt not thus\nimpose on me--if I renounce present fame and future ambition, I renounce\nit for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me, Rebecca,”\n he said, again softening his tone; “England,--Europe,--is not the\nworld. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even for my\nambition. We will go to Palestine, where Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat,\nis my friend--a friend free as myself from the doting scruples which\nfetter our free-born reason--rather with Saladin will we league\nourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn.--I will\nform new paths to greatness,” he continued, again traversing the room\nwith hasty strides--“Europe shall hear the loud step of him she has\ndriven from her sons!--Not the millions whom her crusaders send to\nslaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine--not the sabres of the\nthousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep into\nthat land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of\nme and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere\nto me in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen, Rebecca--on Mount Carmel\nshall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will\nexchange my long-desired batoon for a sceptre!”\n\n“A dream,” said Rebecca; “an empty vision of the night, which, were it\na waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which thou\nmightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or\nreligious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties,\nand cast away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member,\nin order to gratify an unruly passion for the daughter of another\npeople.--Put not a price on my deliverance, Sir Knight--sell not a deed\nof generosity--protect the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not\nfor a selfish advantage--Go to the throne of England; Richard will\nlisten to my appeal from these cruel men.”\n\n“Never, Rebecca!” said the Templar, fiercely. “If I renounce my Order,\nfor thee alone will I renounce it--Ambition shall remain mine, if thou\nrefuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.--Stoop my crest to\nRichard?--ask a boon of that heart of pride?--Never, Rebecca, will I\nplace the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake\nthe Order, I never will degrade or betray it.”\n\n“Now God be gracious to me,” said Rebecca, “for the succour of man is\nwell-nigh hopeless!”\n\n“It is indeed,” said the Templar; “for, proud as thou art, thou hast in\nme found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest, think\nnot any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength;\nand think then upon thine own fate--to die the dreadful death of the\nworst of criminals--to be consumed upon a blazing pile--dispersed to the\nelements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed--not a\nrelic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived\nand moved!--Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect--thou\nwilt yield to my suit.”\n\n“Bois-Guilbert,” answered the Jewess, “thou knowest not the heart\nof woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best\nfeelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles\nhast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown\nby woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a\nwoman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient\nof pain--yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to\nsuffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that my courage shall\nmount higher than thine. Farewell--I waste no more words on thee; the\ntime that remains on earth to the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise\nspent--she must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his\npeople, but who ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in\nsincerity and in truth.”\n\n“We part then thus?” said the Templar, after a short pause; “would to\nHeaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth and\nChristian in faith!--Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think when\nand how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine own\ndegraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of\nspear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my look\nonly terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor--this could I wish,\nRebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share I\nmust have in thy death.”\n\n“Thou hast spoken the Jew,” said Rebecca, “as the persecution of such\nas thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his country,\nbut industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence,\nwhich oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history of the\npeople of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such\nmarvels among the nations, were then a people of misers and of\nusurers!--And know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which\nyour boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the\ncedar--names that ascend far back to those high times when the Divine\nPresence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive\ntheir splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful Voice, which\nbade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the Vision--Such\nwere the princes of the House of Jacob.”\n\nRebecca's colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race,\nbut faded as she added, with at sigh, “Such WERE the princes of Judah,\nnow such no more!--They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and\nmixed with the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who\nshame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac\nthe son of Adonikam! Farewell!--I envy not thy blood-won honours--I envy\nnot thy barbarous descent from northern heathens--I envy thee not thy\nfaith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy\npractice.”\n\n“There is a spell on me, by Heaven!” said Bois-Guilbert. “I almost think\nyon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with which\nI part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.--Fair\ncreature!” he said, approaching near her, but with great respect,--“so\nyoung, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and\nwith infamy and agony. Who would not weep for thee?--The tear, that has\nbeen a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I\ngaze on thee. But it must be--nothing may now save thy life. Thou and\nI are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that\nhurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which\nare dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let\nus part, at least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in\nvain, and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.”\n\n“Thus,” said Rebecca, “do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild\npassions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the author of my\nearly death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind;\nbut it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and\nconspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.”\n\n“Yes,” said the Templar, “I am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me,\nuntaught, untamed--and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and\ncrafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me\nabove them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high\nin my views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I\nremain--proud, inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall\nhave proof.--But thou forgivest me, Rebecca?”\n\n“As freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.”\n\n“Farewell, then,” said the Templar, and left the apartment.\n\nThe Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the\nreturn of Bois-Guilbert.\n\n“Thou hast tarried long,” he said; “I have been as if stretched on\nred-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or his spy\nConrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.--But what\nails thee, brother?--Thy step totters, thy brow is as black as night.\nArt thou well, Bois-Guilbert?”\n\n“Ay,” answered the Templar, “as well as the wretch who is doomed to die\nwithin an hour.--Nay, by the rood, not half so well--for there be those\nin such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By Heaven,\nMalvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me. I am half resolved to\ngo to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth, and refuse\nto act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me.”\n\n“Thou art mad,” answered Malvoisin; “thou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin\nthyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life of\nthis Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will\nname another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the\naccused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed\non thee.”\n\n“'Tis false--I will myself take arms in her behalf,” answered the\nTemplar, haughtily; “and, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, that thou\nknowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point\nof my lance.”\n\n“Ay, but thou forgettest,” said the wily adviser, “thou wilt have\nneither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to Lucas\nBeaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see\nhow long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom.\nThe words shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an\nhundred feet under ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide\ntrial as a recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy\npossession, thou wilt be enjoying straw, darkness, and chains, in some\ndistant convent cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy\nwater, to expel the foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee.\nThou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.”\n\n“I will break forth and fly,” said Bois-Guilbert--“fly to some distant\nland, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way. No\ndrop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by my\nsanction.”\n\n“Thou canst not fly,” said the Preceptor; “thy ravings have excited\nsuspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go\nand make the essay--present thyself before the gate, and command the\nbridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.--Thou are\nsurprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou\nto fly, what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of\nthine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?--Think on it. Where\nshall thine old companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de\nBois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant,\namid the hisses of the assembled people? What grief will be at the Court\nof France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news, that\nthe knight that set him hard in Palestine, and well-nigh darkened his\nrenown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could not\neven save by so costly a sacrifice!”\n\n“Malvoisin,” said the Knight, “I thank thee--thou hast touched the\nstring at which my heart most readily thrills!--Come of it what may,\nrecreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to\nGod, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear in\nthese lists! But they will be empty--no one will risk to break a lance\nfor the innocent, the forlorn.”\n\n“The better for thee, if it prove so,” said the Preceptor; “if no\nchampion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall\ndie, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame,\nand who will count that blame for praise and commendation.”\n\n“True,” said Bois-Guilbert; “if no champion appears, I am but a part\nof the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no\npart in what is to follow.”\n\n“None whatever,” said Malvoisin; “no more than the armed image of Saint\nGeorge when it makes part of a procession.”\n\n“Well, I will resume my resolution,” replied the haughty Templar. “She\nhas despised me--repulsed me--reviled me--And wherefore should I offer\nup for her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others?\nMalvoisin, I will appear in the lists.”\n\nHe left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the\nPreceptor followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in\nBois-Guilbert's fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much\nadvantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to\nmention the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on\ncondition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca.\nYet although, in combating his friend's better feelings, he possessed\nall the advantage which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over\na man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all\nMalvoisin's art to keep Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had\nprevailed on him to adopt. He was obliged to watch him closely\nto prevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to intercept his\ncommunication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an open\nrupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various\narguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as\nchampion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating or\nensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which he\ncould save himself from degradation and disgrace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n     Shadows avaunt!--Richard's himself again.\n     Richard III\n\nWhen the Black Knight--for it becomes necessary to resume the train of\nhis adventures--left the Trysting-tree of the generous Outlaw, he held\nhis way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent\nand revenue, called the Priory of Saint Botolph, to which the wounded\nIvanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance\nof the faithful Gurth, and the magnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at\npresent to mention what took place in the interim betwixt Wilfred\nand his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave\ncommunication, messengers were dispatched by the Prior in several\ndirections, and that on the succeeding morning the Black Knight was\nabout to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who\nattended as his guide.\n\n“We will meet,” he said to Ivanhoe, “at Coningsburgh, the castle of the\ndeceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds the funeral\nfeast for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together,\nSir Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.\nThou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy\nfather.”\n\nSo saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed an\nanxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the Black Knight would\nnot listen to the proposal.\n\n“Rest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the\nnext. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, who can play priest\nor fool as I shall be most in the humour.”\n\n“And I,” said Wamba, “will attend you with all my heart. I would fain\nsee the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be not full\nand frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and\ncupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, Sir Knight, I\nwill trust your valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in\ncase mine own wit should fail.”\n\n“And how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit\nhalts?--resolve me that.”\n\n“Wit, Sir Knight,” replied the Jester, “may do much. He is a quick,\napprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, and knows how\nto keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is a\nsturdy fellow, that makes all split. He rows against both wind and tide,\nand makes way notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight, while I\ntake advantage of the fair weather in our noble master's temper, I will\nexpect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough.”\n\n“Sir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be\ndistinguished,” said Ivanhoe, “I fear me you have chosen a talkative and\na troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and alley\nin the woods as well as e'er a hunter who frequents them; and the poor\nknave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.”\n\n“Nay,” said the Knight, “an he have the gift of showing my road, I shall\nnot grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.--Fare\nthee well, kind Wilfred--I charge thee not to attempt to travel till\nto-morrow at earliest.”\n\nSo saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips,\ntook leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with Wamba for\nhis companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were\nlost in the shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into the\nconvent.\n\nBut shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old man\ncame in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his health.\n\n“It is better,” he said, “than my fondest hope could have anticipated;\neither my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to\nsuppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel\nalready as if I could bear my corslet; and so much the better, for\nthoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer\nin inactivity.”\n\n“Now, the saints forbid,” said the Prior, “that the son of the Saxon\nCedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! It were\nshame to our profession were we to suffer it.”\n\n“Nor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable father,”\n said Ivanhoe, “did I not feel myself able to endure the journey, and\ncompelled to undertake it.”\n\n“And what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?” said the Prior.\n\n“Have you never, holy father,” answered the Knight, “felt an\napprehension of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted to\nassign a cause?--Have you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny\nlandscape, by the sudden cloud, which augurs a coming tempest?--And\nthinkest thou not that such impulses are deserving of attention, as\nbeing the hints of our guardian spirits, that danger is impending?”\n\n“I may not deny,” said the Prior, crossing himself, “that such things\nhave been, and have been of Heaven; but then such communications have\nhad a visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art,\nwhat avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst\nnot aid, were he to be assaulted?”\n\n“Prior,” said Ivanhoe, “thou dost mistake--I am stout enough to exchange\nbuffets with any who will challenge me to such a traffic--But were it\notherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by other means than by\nforce of arms? It is but too well known that the Saxons love not the\nNorman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon\nthem when their hearts are irritated by the death of Athelstane,\nand their heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge\nthemselves? I hold his entrance among them at such a moment most\nperilous, and I am resolved to share or avert the danger; which, that I\nmay the better do, I would crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose\npace may be softer than that of my 'destrier'.” [56]\n\n“Surely,” said the worthy churchman; “you shall have mine own ambling\njennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the Abbot\nof Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call her, that\nunless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler's steed that paces a\nhornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a creature so\ngentle and smooth-paced. I have composed many a homily on her back, to\nthe edification of my brethren of the convent, and many poor Christian\nsouls.”\n\n“I pray you, reverend father,” said Ivanhoe, “let Malkin be got ready\ninstantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.”\n\n“Nay, but fair sir,” said the Prior, “I pray you to remember that Malkin\nhath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrant not her\nenduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I\npromise you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue\nweight--I did but borrow the 'Fructus Temporum' from the priest of Saint\nBees, and I promise you she would not stir from the gate until I had\nexchanged the huge volume for my little breviary.”\n\n“Trust me, holy father,” said Ivanhoe, “I will not distress her with too\nmuch weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she has\nthe worst.”\n\nThis reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knight's heels a\npair of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse that\nhis best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.\n\nThe deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoe's heels were now\narmed, began to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, and\nejaculate,--“Nay, but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth not\nthe spur--Better it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple\ndown at the Grange, which may be had in little more than an hour, and\ncannot but be tractable, in respect that she draweth much of our winter\nfire-wood, and eateth no corn.”\n\n“I thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as\nI see Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carry mine\narmour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload\nMalkin's back, she shall not overcome my patience. And now, farewell!”\n\nIvanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his\nwound promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the\nimportunity of the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his\nage and fatness would permit, now singing the praises of Malkin, now\nrecommending caution to the Knight in managing her.\n\n“She is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,” said\nthe old man, laughing at his own jest, “being barely in her fifteenth\nyear.”\n\nIvanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfrey's\npaces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Prior's grave advices\nand facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his\nsquire (for such Gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he\nfollowed the track of the Black Knight into the forest, while the\nPrior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him, and\nejaculating,--“Saint Mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war!\nI would I had not trusted Malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as I\nam with the cold rheum, I am undone if aught but good befalls her. And\nyet,” said he, recollecting himself, “as I would not spare my own old\nand disabled limbs in the good cause of Old England, so Malkin must e'en\nrun her hazard on the same venture; and it may be they will think our\npoor house worthy of some munificent guerdon--or, it may be, they will\nsend the old Prior a pacing nag. And if they do none of these, as great\nmen will forget little men's service, truly I shall hold me well repaid\nin having done that which is right. And it is now well-nigh the fitting\ntime to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectory--Ah! I doubt\nthey obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and matins.”\n\nSo the Prior of Saint Botolph's hobbled back again into the refectory,\nto preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for\nthe friars' breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the table,\nand many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to the\nconvent, and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another\nseason, would have attracted observation. But as the stockfish was\nhighly salted, and the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren\nwere too anxiously employed to admit of their making much use of their\nears; nor do we read of any of the fraternity, who was tempted to\nspeculate upon the mysterious hints of their Superior, except Father\nDiggory, who was severely afflicted by the toothache, so that he could\nonly eat on one side of his jaws.\n\nIn the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their\nleisure through the recesses of the forest; the good Knight whiles\nhumming to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes\nencouraging by questions the prating disposition of his attendant, so\nthat their dialogue formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest, of\nwhich we would fain give our readers some idea. You are then to imagine\nthis Knight, such as we have already described him, strong of person,\ntall, broad-shouldered, and large of bone, mounted on his mighty black\ncharger, which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight, so easily he\npaced forward under it, having the visor of his helmet raised, in order\nto admit freedom of breath, yet keeping the beaver, or under part,\nclosed, so that his features could be but imperfectly distinguished. But\nhis ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could be plainly seen, and the large and\nbright blue eyes, that flashed from under the dark shade of the raised\nvisor; and the whole gesture and look of the champion expressed careless\ngaiety and fearless confidence--a mind which was unapt to apprehend\ndanger, and prompt to defy it when most imminent--yet with whom danger\nwas a familiar thought, as with one whose trade was war and adventure.\n\nThe Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led\nhim to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with\na targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding\nhis profession, shown himself a skilful master during the storming of\nTorquilstone. Indeed, the infirmity of Wamba's brain consisted chiefly\nin a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him not long to\nremain quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas,\nalthough he was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any\nimmediate task, or in apprehending any immediate topic. On horseback,\ntherefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards,\nnow on the horse's ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,--now\nhanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting with his face to the\ntail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until his\npalfrey took his freaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his\nlength on the green grass--an incident which greatly amused the Knight,\nbut compelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter.\n\nAt the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous pair\nwere engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in which the clown\nbore a mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the Fetterlock.\nAnd thus run the ditty:--\n\n     Anna-Marie, love, up is the sun,\n     Anna-Marie, love, morn is begun,\n     Mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,\n     Up in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.\n     Anna-Marie, love, up in the morn,\n     The hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,\n     The echo rings merry from rock and from tree,\n     'Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.\n\nWamba.\n\n     O Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,\n     Around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,\n     For what are the joys that in waking we prove,\n     Compared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?\n     Let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,\n     Let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,\n     Softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,--\n     But think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.\n\n“A dainty song,” said Wamba, when they had finished their carol, “and I\nswear by my bauble, a pretty moral!--I used to sing it with Gurth, once\nmy playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less than\na freemen; and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced by the\nmelody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty\nbetwixt sleeping and waking--my bones ache at thinking of the tune ever\nsince. Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to please\nyou, fair sir.”\n\nThe Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to\nwhich the Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.\n\nKnight and Wamba.\n\n     There came three merry men from south, west, and north,\n     Ever more sing the roundelay;\n     To win the Widow of Wycombe forth,\n     And where was the widow might say them nay?\n\n     The first was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,\n     Ever more sing the roundelay;\n     And his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,\n     And where was the widow might say him nay?\n\n     Of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,\n     He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;\n     She bade him go bask by his sea-coal fire,\n     For she was the widow would say him nay.\n\nWamba.\n\n     The next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,\n     Merrily sing the roundelay;\n     Hur's a gentleman, God wot, and hur's lineage was of Wales,\n     And where was the widow might say him nay?\n\n     Sir David ap Morgan ap Griffith ap Hugh\n     Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelay\n     She said that one widow for so many was too few,\n     And she bade the Welshman wend his way.\n\n     But then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,\n     Jollily singing his roundelay;\n     He spoke to the widow of living and rent,\n     And where was the widow could say him nay?\n\nBoth.\n\n     So the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,\n     There for to sing their roundelay;\n     For a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,\n     There never was a widow could say him nay.\n\n“I would, Wamba,” said the knight, “that our host of the Trysting-tree,\nor the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise of our\nbluff yeoman.”\n\n“So would not I,” said Wamba--“but for the horn that hangs at your\nbaldric.”\n\n“Ay,” said the Knight,--“this is a pledge of Locksley's goodwill, though\nI am not like to need it. Three mots on this bugle will, I am assured,\nbring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.”\n\n“I would say, Heaven forefend,” said the Jester, “were it not that that\nfair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.”\n\n“Why, what meanest thou?” said the Knight; “thinkest thou that but for\nthis pledge of fellowship they would assault us?”\n\n“Nay, for me I say nothing,” said Wamba; “for green trees have ears as\nwell as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, Sir Knight--When\nis thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?”\n\n“Why, never, I think,” replied the Knight.\n\n“Thou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an\nanswer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a Saxon,\nand leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.”\n\n“You hold our friends for robbers, then?” said the Knight of the\nFetterlock.\n\n“You hear me not say so, fair sir,” said Wamba; “it may relieve a man's\nsteed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to make; and,\ncertes, it may do good to the rider's soul to ease him of that which is\nthe root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names to those who do\nsuch services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my\nchamber, when I meet with these good fellows, because it might save them\nsome trouble.”\n\n“WE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair\ncharacter thou dost afford them.”\n\n“Pray for them with all my heart,” said Wamba; “but in the town, not\nin the greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom they caused to say\nmass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.”\n\n“Say as thou list, Wamba,” replied the Knight, “these yeomen did thy\nmaster Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.”\n\n“Ay, truly,” answered Wamba; “but that was in the fashion of their trade\nwith Heaven.”\n\n“Their trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?” replied his companion.\n\n“Marry, thus,” said the Jester. “They make up a balanced account with\nHeaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as Isaac\nthe Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little,\nand take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on their own\nbehalf the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to\ncharitable loans.”\n\n“Give me an example of your meaning, Wamba,--I know nothing of ciphers\nor rates of usage,” answered the Knight.\n\n“Why,” said Wamba, “an your valour be so dull, you will please to learn\nthat those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so\nlaudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants\ntaken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the\nrelief of a poor widow.”\n\n“Which of these was the good deed, which was the felony?” interrupted\nthe Knight.\n\n“A good gibe! a good gibe!” said Wamba; “keeping witty company\nsharpeneth the apprehension. You said nothing so well, Sir Knight, I\nwill be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.--But\nto go on. The merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage\nwith the burning of a castle,--the thatching of a choir against the\nrobbing of a church,--the setting free a poor prisoner against the\nmurder of a proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the\ndeliverance of a Saxon franklin against the burning alive of a Norman\nbaron. Gentle thieves they are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it\nis ever the luckiest to meet with them when they are at the worst.”\n\n“How so, Wamba?” said the Knight.\n\n“Why, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters\nwith Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance, Heaven help them\nwith whom they next open the account! The travellers who first met\nthem after their good service at Torquilstone would have a woeful\nflaying.--And yet,” said Wamba, coming close up to the Knight's side,\n“there be companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet\nthan yonder outlaws.”\n\n“And who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I trow?”\n said the Knight.\n\n“Marry, sir, but we have Malvoisin's men-at-arms,” said Wamba; “and let\nme tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of these is worth\na band of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their harvest,\nand are reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from Torquilstone.\nSo that, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our\nfeats of arms.--Now, I pray you, Sir Knight, what would you do if we met\ntwo of them?”\n\n“Pin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us\nany impediment.”\n\n“But what if there were four of them?”\n\n“They should drink of the same cup,” answered the Knight.\n\n“What if six,” continued Wamba, “and we as we now are, barely two--would\nyou not remember Locksley's horn?”\n\n“What! sound for aid,” exclaimed the Knight, “against a score of such\n'rascaille' as these, whom one good knight could drive before him, as\nthe wind drives the withered leaves?”\n\n“Nay, then,” said Wamba, “I will pray you for a close sight of that same\nhorn that hath so powerful a breath.”\n\nThe Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his\nfellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.\n\n“Tra-lira-la,” said he, whistling the notes; “nay, I know my gamut as\nwell as another.”\n\n“How mean you, knave?” said the Knight; “restore me the bugle.”\n\n“Content you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly\ntravel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.”\n\n“Nay but, rogue,” said the Black Knight, “this exceedeth thy\nlicense--Beware ye tamper not with my patience.”\n\n“Urge me not with violence, Sir Knight,” said the Jester, keeping at a\ndistance from the impatient champion, “or Folly will show a clean pair\nof heels, and leave Valour to find out his way through the wood as best\nhe may.”\n\n“Nay, thou hast hit me there,” said the Knight; “and, sooth to say, I\nhave little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt, but\nlet us proceed on our journey.”\n\n“You will not harm me, then?” said Wamba.\n\n“I tell thee no, thou knave!”\n\n“Ay, but pledge me your knightly word for it,” continued Wamba, as he\napproached with great caution.\n\n“My knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.”\n\n“Nay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,” said the\nJester, coming up frankly to the Knight's side; “but, in truth, I love\nnot such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his\nholiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. And now that\nFolly wears the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane;\nfor, if I mistake not, there are company in yonder brake that are on the\nlook-out for us.”\n\n“What makes thee judge so?” said the Knight.\n\n“Because I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from\namongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they had kept the\npath. But yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint\nNicholas.”\n\n“By my faith,” said the Knight, closing his visor, “I think thou be'st\nin the right on't.”\n\nAnd in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same\ninstant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of\nwhich would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside\nby the steel visor. The other two were averted by the gorget, and by the\nshield which hung around his neck.\n\n“Thanks, trusty armourers,” said the Knight.--“Wamba, let us close with\nthem,”--and he rode straight to the thicket. He was met by six or seven\nmen-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career. Three\nof the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as little effect\nas if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The Black Knight's\neyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his visor. He\nraised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity, and\nexclaimed, “What means this, my masters!”--The men made no other reply\nthan by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side, crying,\n“Die, tyrant!”\n\n“Ha! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!” said the Black Knight, striking\ndown a man at every invocation; “have we traitors here?”\n\nHis opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which\ncarried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his\nsingle strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a\nknight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other\nassailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the\nrider but at the steed, wounded the noble animal mortally.\n\n“That was a felon stroke!” exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed fell\nto the earth, bearing his rider along with him.\n\nAnd at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so\nspeedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. The sudden sound made\nthe murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly\nweaponed, did not hesitate to rush in and assist the Black Knight to\nrise.\n\n“Shame on ye, false cowards!” exclaimed he in the blue harness, who\nseemed to lead the assailants, “do ye fly from the empty blast of a horn\nblown by a Jester?”\n\nAnimated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best\nrefuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with\nhis sword. The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the\nmoment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped\nagainst him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when\nhis purpose was again intercepted by Wamba. The Jester, making up by\nagility the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who\nwere busied in their more important object, hovered on the skirts of the\nfight, and effectually checked the fatal career of the Blue Knight, by\nhamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword. Horse and man went to\nthe ground; yet the situation of the Knight of the Fetterlock continued\nvery precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely\narmed, and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary\nto defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when\na grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most\nformidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the\nglade, headed by Locksley and the jovial Friar, who, taking ready and\neffectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom\nlay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. The Black Knight thanked his\ndeliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,\nwhich hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a\nperson of exalted rank.\n\n“It concerns me much,” he said, “even before I express my full gratitude\nto my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have been my unprovoked\nenemies.--Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who seems the chief\nof these villains.”\n\nThe Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who,\nbruised by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay\nincapable either of flight or resistance.\n\n“Come, valiant sir,” said Wamba, “I must be your armourer as well as\nyour equerry--I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelm you.”\n\nSo saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue\nKnight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the\nKnight of the Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not\nexpect to have seen under such circumstances.\n\n“Waldemar Fitzurse!” he said in astonishment; “what could urge one of\nthy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?”\n\n“Richard,” said the captive Knight, looking up to him, “thou knowest\nlittle of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can\nlead every child of Adam.”\n\n“Revenge?” answered the Black Knight; “I never wronged thee--On me thou\nhast nought to revenge.”\n\n“My daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn--was that no\ninjury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?”\n\n“Thy daughter?” replied the Black Knight; “a proper cause of enmity, and\nfollowed up to a bloody issue!--Stand back, my masters, I would speak\nto him alone.--And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the truth--confess who\nset thee on this traitorous deed.”\n\n“Thy father's son,” answered Waldemar, “who, in so doing, did but avenge\non thee thy disobedience to thy father.”\n\nRichard's eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame\nit. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an instant gazing\non the face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending\nwith shame.\n\n“Thou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,” said the King.\n\n“He that is in the lion's clutch,” answered Fitzurse, “knows it were\nneedless.”\n\n“Take it, then, unasked,” said Richard; “the lion preys not on prostrate\ncarcasses.--Take thy life, but with this condition, that in three days\nthou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy Norman\ncastle, and that thou wilt never mention the name of John of Anjou as\nconnected with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground after the\nspace I have allotted thee, thou diest--or if thou breathest aught\nthat can attaint the honour of my house, by Saint George! not the altar\nitself shall be a sanctuary. I will hang thee out to feed the ravens,\nfrom the very pinnacle of thine own castle.--Let this knight have a\nsteed, Locksley, for I see your yeomen have caught those which were\nrunning loose, and let him depart unharmed.”\n\n“But that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be\ndisputed,” answered the yeoman, “I would send a shaft after the skulking\nvillain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.”\n\n“Thou bearest an English heart, Locksley,” said the Black Knight, “and\nwell dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest--I am Richard\nof England!”\n\nAt these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank,\nand no less distinguished character of Coeur-de-Lion, the yeomen at once\nkneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance,\nand implored pardon for their offences.\n\n“Rise, my friends,” said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on\nthem with a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already\nconquered the blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no\nmark of the late desperate conflict, excepting the flush arising from\nexertion,--“Arise,” he said, “my friends!--Your misdemeanours, whether\nin forest or field, have been atoned by the loyal services you rendered\nmy distressed subjects before the walls of Torquilstone, and the rescue\nyou have this day afforded to your sovereign. Arise, my liegemen, and be\ngood subjects in future.--And thou, brave Locksley--”\n\n“Call me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name,\nwhich, I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your\nroyal ears--I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.” [561]\n\n“King of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!” said the King, “who\nhath not heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine? But be\nassured, brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the\nturbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy\ndisadvantage.”\n\n“True says the proverb,” said Wamba, interposing his word, but with some\nabatement of his usual petulance,--\n\n“'When the cat is away, The mice will play.'”\n\n“What, Wamba, art thou there?” said Richard; “I have been so long of\nhearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken flight.”\n\n“I take flight!” said Wamba; “when do you ever find Folly separated from\nValour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey gelding, whom\nI heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay there\nhoughed in his place. It is true, I gave a little ground at first, for\na motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel doublet will. But\nif I fought not at sword's point, you will grant me that I sounded the\nonset.”\n\n“And to good purpose, honest Wamba,” replied the King. “Thy good service\nshall not be forgotten.”\n\n“'Confiteor! Confiteor!'”--exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice near\nthe King's side--“my Latin will carry me no farther--but I confess my\ndeadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before I am led to\nexecution!”\n\nRichard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees, telling\nhis rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the\nskirmish, lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was gathered so\nas he thought might best express the most profound contrition, his\neyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as Wamba\nexpressed it, like the tassels at the mouth of a purse. Yet this demure\naffectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous\nmeaning which lurked in his huge features, and seemed to pronounce his\nfear and repentance alike hypocritical.\n\n“For what art thou cast down, mad Priest?” said Richard; “art thou\nafraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve Our Lady and\nSaint Dunstan?--Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no\nsecrets that pass over the flagon.”\n\n“Nay, most gracious sovereign,” answered the Hermit, (well known to the\ncurious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name of Friar\nTuck,) “it is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.--Alas! that my\nsacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the Lord's\nanointed!”\n\n“Ha! ha!” said Richard, “sits the wind there?--In truth I had forgotten\nthe buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. But if the\ncuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if it\nwas not as well repaid--or, if thou thinkest I still owe thee aught, and\nwill stand forth for another counterbuff--”\n\n“By no means,” replied Friar Tuck, “I had mine own returned, and with\nusury--may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!”\n\n“If I could do so with cuffs,” said the King, “my creditors should have\nlittle reason to complain of an empty exchequer.”\n\n“And yet,” said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical countenance,\n“I know not what penance I ought to perform for that most sacrilegious\nblow!---”\n\n“Speak no more of it, brother,” said the King; “after having stood\nso many cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void of reason to\nquarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet,\nmine honest Friar, I think it would be best both for the church and\nthyself, that I should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain\nthee as a yeoman of our guard, serving in care of our person, as\nformerly in attendance upon the altar of Saint Dunstan.”\n\n“My Liege,” said the Friar, “I humbly crave your pardon; and you would\nreadily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin of laziness has\nbeset me. Saint Dunstan--may he be gracious to us!--stands quiet in his\nniche, though I should forget my orisons in killing a fat buck--I stay\nout of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what--Saint Dunstan\nnever complains--a quiet master he is, and a peaceful, as ever was made\nof wood.--But to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the King--the\nhonour is great, doubtless--yet, if I were but to step aside to comfort\na widow in one corner, or to kill a deer in another, it would be, 'where\nis the dog Priest?' says one. 'Who has seen the accursed Tuck?' says\nanother. 'The unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half the\ncountry besides,' says one keeper; 'And is hunting after every shy doe\nin the country!' quoth a second.--In fine, good my Liege, I pray you\nto leave me as you found me; or, if in aught you desire to extend your\nbenevolence to me, that I may be considered as the poor Clerk of Saint\nDunstan's cell in Copmanhurst, to whom any small donation will be most\nthankfully acceptable.”\n\n“I understand thee,” said the King, “and the Holy Clerk shall have a\ngrant of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark, however, I\nwill but assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove\nan apology for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christian knight nor true\nking.”\n\n“Your Grace may be well assured,” said the Friar, “that, with the\ngrace of Saint Dunstan, I shall find the way of multiplying your most\nbounteous gift.”\n\n“I nothing doubt it, good brother,” said the King; “and as venison is\nbut dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a butt\nof sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the first\nstrike, yearly--If that will not quench thy thirst, thou must come to\ncourt, and become acquainted with my butler.”\n\n“But for Saint Dunstan?” said the Friar--\n\n“A cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,” continued\nthe King, crossing himself--“But we may not turn our game into earnest,\nlest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour\nand worship.”\n\n“I will answer for my patron,” said the Priest, joyously.\n\n“Answer for thyself, Friar,” said King Richard, something sternly; but\nimmediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter, somewhat\nabashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. “Thou dost less honour to my\nextended palm than to my clenched fist,” said the Monarch; “thou didst\nonly kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.”\n\nBut the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing\nthe conversation in too jocose a style--a false step to be particularly\nguarded against by those who converse with monarchs--bowed profoundly,\nand fell into the rear.\n\nAt the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n     All hail to the lordlings of high degree,\n     Who live not more happy, though greater than we!\n     Our pastimes to see,\n     Under every green tree,\n     In all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be.\n     Macdonald\n\nThe new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph's\npalfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight's own war-horse.\nThe astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master\nbesprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in\nthe little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less\nsurprised to see Richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the\noutlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue\ntherefore for a prince. He hesitated whether to address the King as the\nBlack Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards\nhim. Richard saw his embarrassment.\n\n“Fear not, Wilfred,” he said, “to address Richard Plantagenet as\nhimself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts,\nalthough it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm\nEnglish blood.”\n\n“Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,” said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward, “my\nassurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say\nsomewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer\nsubjects than those who now stand around him.”\n\n“I cannot doubt it, brave man,” said Wilfred, “since thou art of the\nnumber--But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain men,\nand the bloody armour of my Prince?”\n\n“Treason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,” said the King; “but, thanks to\nthese brave men, treason hath met its meed--But, now I bethink me, thou\ntoo art a traitor,” said Richard, smiling; “a most disobedient traitor;\nfor were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst repose thyself at\nSaint Botolph's until thy wound was healed?”\n\n“It is healed,” said Ivanhoe; “it is not of more consequence than the\nscratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex\nthe hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely\njourneys and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that\nof a mere knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and\nsword may procure him?”\n\n“And Richard Plantagenet,” said the King, “desires no more fame than his\ngood lance and sword may acquire him--and Richard Plantagenet is prouder\nof achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his good arm\nto speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand armed\nmen.”\n\n“But your kingdom, my Liege,” said Ivanhoe, “your kingdom is threatened\nwith dissolution and civil war--your subjects menaced with every species\nof evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which\nit is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this\nmoment narrowly escaped.”\n\n“Ho! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?” answered Richard, impatiently; “I\ntell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing to repay\nmy follies in kind--For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of\nIvanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king a\nhomily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has\nmost reason to upbraid the other?--Yet forgive me, my faithful Wilfred.\nThe time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I\nexplained to thee at Saint Botolph's, necessary to give my friends\nand faithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richard's\nreturn is announced, he should be at the head of such a force as enemies\nshall tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason, without\neven unsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong\nenough to move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must have news\nof Salisbury from the south; and of Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of\nMulton and Percy in the north. The Chancellor must make sure of London.\nToo sudden an appearance would subject me to dangers, other than\nmy lance and sword, though backed by the bow of bold Robin, or the\nquarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may be able\nto rescue me from.”\n\nWilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend\nwith the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master\nupon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it\nwas unpardonable in him to have sought out. The young knight sighed,\ntherefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having\nsilenced his counsellor, though his heart acknowledged the justice of\nthe charge he had brought against him, went on in conversation with\nRobin Hood.--“King of Outlaws,” he said, “have you no refreshment to\noffer to your brother sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me\nboth in exercise and appetite.”\n\n“In troth,” replied the Outlaw, “for I scorn to lie to your Grace,\nour larder is chiefly supplied with--” He stopped, and was somewhat\nembarrassed.\n\n“With venison, I suppose?” said Richard, gaily; “better food at need\nthere can be none--and truly, if a king will not remain at home and\nslay his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it\nkilled to his hand.”\n\n“If your Grace, then,” said Robin, “will again honour with your presence\none of Robin Hood's places of rendezvous, the venison shall not be\nlacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good\nwine, to relish it withal.”\n\nThe Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch,\nmore happy, probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his\nforesters, than he would have been in again assuming his royal state,\nand presiding over a splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in\nsociety and adventure were the zest of life to Richard Coeur-de-Lion,\nand it had its highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered\nand surmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless\ncharacter, of a knight of romance, was in a great measure realized and\nrevived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of\narms, was far more dear to his excited imagination, than that which a\ncourse of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government.\nAccordingly, his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid\nmeteor, which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an\nunnecessary and portentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by\nuniversal darkness; his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards\nand minstrels, but affording none of those solid benefits to his country\non which history loves to pause, and hold up as an example to posterity.\nBut in his present company Richard showed to the greatest imaginable\nadvantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of manhood in every rank\nof life.\n\nBeneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the\nKing of England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who\nnow formed his court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough\nforesters soon lost their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song\nand the jest were exchanged--the stories of former deeds were told\nwith advantage; and at length, and while boasting of their successful\ninfraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in\npresence of their natural guardian. The merry King, nothing heeding his\ndignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among\nthe jolly band. The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be\ndesirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to\ndisturb its harmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe's brow\nclouded with anxiety. “We are honoured,” he said to Ivanhoe, apart, “by\nthe presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he dallied\nwith time, which the circumstances of his kingdom may render precious.”\n\n“It is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,” said Wilfred, apart;\n“and know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest\nmood are but toying with the lion's whelp, which, on slight provocation,\nuses both fangs and claws.”\n\n“You have touched the very cause of my fear,” said the Outlaw; “my\nmen are rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as\ngood-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how\nwarmly it may be received--it is time this revel were broken off.”\n\n“It must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,” said Ivanhoe;\n“for each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to\nprolong it.”\n\n“Must I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?” said Robin\nHood, pausing for all instant; “but by Saint Christopher, it shall be\nso. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.--Here,\nScathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a Norman blast on\nthy bugle, and without an instant's delay on peril of your life.”\n\nScathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the\nrevellers were startled by the sound of his horn.\n\n“It is the bugle of Malvoisin,” said the Miller, starting to his feet,\nand seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his\nquarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook\nhimself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.\n\nMen of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet\nto the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of\npleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his\narmour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on,\nhe laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest\ndispleasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was\napproaching.\n\n“Thou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,--and I have seen\nit. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his\nfriend and liegeman.”\n\nIn the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in\ndifferent directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw\nthe company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now\ncompletely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his\nSovereign.\n\n“For what, good yeoman?” said Richard, somewhat impatiently. “Have we\nnot already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions? Thinkest\nthou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between us?\nThou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that time?”\n\n“Ay, but I have though,” answered the yeoman, “if it be an offence to\ndeceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard\nwas none of Malvoisin's, but blown by my direction, to break off the\nbanquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus\ndallied with.”\n\nHe then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner\nrather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the King,--like\none who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is confident in the\nrectitude of his motive. The blood rushed in anger to the countenance\nof Richard; but it was the first transient emotion, and his sense of\njustice instantly subdued it.\n\n“The King of Sherwood,” he said, “grudges his venison and his wine-flask\nto the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!--but when you come to\nsee me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art\nright, however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and away--Wilfred\nhas been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a\nfriend in thy band, who, not content with advising, will needs direct\nthy motions, and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for\nthyself?”\n\n“Such a one,” said Robin, “is my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even\nnow absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I\nwill own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom\nof his councils--but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with\none who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master's\nservice.”\n\n“Thou art right, good yeoman,” answered Richard; “and if I had Ivanhoe,\non the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad\ngravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou\nthinkest my own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own\nwill as any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.--But come, sirs, let us\nmerrily on to Coningsburgh, and think no more on't.”\n\nRobin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of\nthe road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and apprize\nthem of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would\nfind the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receive such timely notice\nof the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of\narchers, with which he himself proposed to follow on the same route.\n\nThe wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched\nRichard's feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain\non account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him.\nHe once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full\npardon and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the\ntyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by\nwhich so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. But\nRichard's good intentions towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated by the\nKing's untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was extorted\nfrom the unwilling hands of King John when he succeeded to his heroic\nbrother. As for the rest of Robin Hood's career, as well as the tale\nof his treacherous death, they are to be found in those black-letter\ngarlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny.\n\n“Now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.”\n\nThe Outlaw's opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe,\nGurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the\nCastle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.\n\nThere are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are\npresented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and\ngentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is\nrichly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river,\nwell defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which,\nas its Saxon name implies, was, previous to the Conquest, a royal\nresidence of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably been\nadded by the Normans, but the inner keep bears token of very great\nantiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court,\nand forms a complete circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter.\nThe wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge\nexternal buttresses which project from the circle, and rise up against\nthe sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it. These\nmassive buttresses are solid when they arise from the foundation, and a\ngood way higher up; but are hollowed out towards the top, and terminate\nin a sort of turrets communicating with the interior of the keep itself.\nThe distant appearance of this huge building, with these singular\naccompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the picturesque, as\nthe interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary, whose imagination\nit carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the vicinity\nof the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of the memorable Hengist; and\nvarious monuments, of great antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the\nneighbouring churchyard. [57]\n\nWhen Coeur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet\nstately building, it was not, as at present, surrounded by external\nfortifications. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering\nthe main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallation than a\nrude barrier of palisades.\n\nA huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced\nthat the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being\nsolemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceased's birth or quality,\nfor armorial bearings were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry\nthemselves and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the\ngate was another banner, on which the figure of a white horse,\nrudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the\nwell-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.\n\nAll around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral\nbanquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only\nevery one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased,\nbut all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and\nconsequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be\nobserved in the fullest extent.\n\nNumerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill\non which the castle was situated; and when the King and his attendants\nentered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space\nwithin presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the\nassemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat\nsheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set abroach, to be drained at\nthe freedom of all comers. Groups of every description were to be seen\ndevouring the food and swallowing the liquor thus abandoned to\ntheir discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense of\nhis half-year's hunger and thirst, in one day of gluttony and\ndrunkenness--the more pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his\nmorsel with gust, or curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and\nthe skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also\nbe seen, distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not\nless so by their keeping together, and looking with great scorn on the\nwhole solemnity, even while condescending to avail themselves of the\ngood cheer which was so liberally supplied.\n\nMendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with\nstrolling soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own\naccount at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling\nmechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers,\nhedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering prayers,\nand extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and rotes. [58]\n\nOne sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric;\nanother, in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh\nnames of his noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting,\nnor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of\ntheir profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons\non these occasions were as natural as they were rude. If sorrow was\nthirsty, there was drink--if hungry, there was food--if it sunk down\nupon and saddened the heart, here were the means supplied of mirth, or\nat least of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves\nof those means of consolation, although, every now and then, as if\nsuddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the men\ngroaned in unison, while the females, of whom many were present, raised\nup their voices and shrieked for very woe.\n\nSuch was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was\nentered by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned\nnot to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually\nentering and withdrawing, unless so far as was necessary to preserve\norder; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the Monarch and\nIvanhoe, more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were\nfamiliar to him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for such their\ndress bespoke them, was a rare event at a Saxon solemnity, and could not\nbut be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. And\nin his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office,\nthis important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage\nof guests, thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of the\ntower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard,\nnor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence\nshould be required.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n     I found them winding of Marcello's corpse.\n     And there was such a solemn melody,\n     'Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,--\n     Such as old grandames, watching by the dead,\n     Are wont to outwear the night with.\n     --Old Play\n\nThe mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very\npeculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in\nwhich it was erected. A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be\nalmost precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side of the\ntower, by which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could\na few years since, gain access to a small stair within the thickness\nof the main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the\nbuilding,--the two lower being dungeons or vaults, which neither receive\nair nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with which\nthey seem to have communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper\napartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given\nby stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses.\n\nBy this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard,\nfollowed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment\nwhich occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred,\nby the difficulties of the ascent, gained time to muffle his face in his\nmantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself\nto his father until the King should give him the signal.\n\nThere were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table,\nabout a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon\nfamilies in the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least,\nelderly men; for the younger race, to the great displeasure of the\nseniors, had, like Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which\nseparated for half a century the Norman victors from the vanquished\nSaxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their\nsilence and their mournful posture, formed a strong contrast to the\nlevity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their grey locks\nand long full beards, together with their antique tunics and loose black\nmantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they\nwere seated, and gave the appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of\nWoden, recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory.\n\nCedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common\nconsent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of Richard\n(only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose\ngravely, and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, “Waes hael”,\nraising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger\nto the customs of his English subjects, returned the greeting with the\nappropriate words, “Drinc hael”, and partook of a cup which was handed\nto him by the sewer. The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who\npledged his father in silence, supplying the usual speech by an\ninclination of his head, lest his voice should have been recognised.\n\nWhen this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and,\nextending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude\nchapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external\nbuttresses. As there was no opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole,\nthe place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or\ntorches, which showed, by a red and smoky light, the arched roof and\nnaked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the crucifix of the same\nmaterial.\n\nBefore this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier\nkneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers,\nwith the greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a\nsplendid “soul-scat” was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund's by the\nmother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole\nbrethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to\nConingsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard\nin the performance of divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the others\nfailed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which\nwent on at the castle. In maintaining this pious watch and ward, the\ngood monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for\nan instant, lest Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay\nhis clutches on the departed Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to\nprevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall, which, having been\nthat used at the funeral of Saint Edmund, was liable to be desecrated,\nif handled by the profane. If, in truth, these attentions could be of\nany use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them at the hands\nof the brethren of Saint Edmund's, since, besides a hundred mancuses\nof gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of Athelstane had\nannounced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part\nof the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetual prayers for\nhis soul, and that of her departed husband. Richard and Wilfred followed\nthe Saxon Cedric into the apartment of death, where, as their guide\npointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of Athelstane, they\nfollowed his example in devoutly crossing themselves, and muttering a\nbrief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.\n\nThis act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to\nfollow him, gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and,\nafter ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a\nsmall oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was about eight feet\nsquare, hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the\nwall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to the west, and\nwidening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun\nfound its way into its dark recess, and showed a female of a dignified\nmien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic\nbeauty. Her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress,\nenhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured\nand flowing tresses, which time had neither thinned nor mingled with\nsilver. Her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent\nwith resignation. On the stone table before her stood a crucifix\nof ivory, beside which was laid a missal, having its pages richly\nilluminated, and its boards adorned with clasps of gold, and bosses of\nthe same precious metal.\n\n“Noble Edith,” said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if\nto give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion,\n“these are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And\nthis, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the\ndeliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.”\n\n“His bravery has my thanks,” returned the lady; “although it be the\nwill of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his\ncourtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to\nbehold the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour\nof sorrow and lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them,\nsatisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can\nyet afford.”\n\nThe guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their\nhospitable guide.\n\nAnother winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size\nwith that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story\nimmediately above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened,\nproceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music. When they entered,\nthey found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons and\nmaidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Four maidens, Rowena leading the\nchoir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased, of which we have only\nbeen able to decipher two or three stanzas:--\n\n     Dust unto dust,\n     To this all must;\n     The tenant hath resign'd\n     The faded form\n     To waste and worm--\n     Corruption claims her kind.\n\n     Through paths unknown\n     Thy soul hath flown,\n     To seek the realms of woe,\n     Where fiery pain\n     Shall purge the stain\n     Of actions done below.\n\n     In that sad place,\n     By Mary's grace,\n     Brief may thy dwelling be\n     Till prayers and alms,\n     And holy psalms,\n     Shall set the captive free.\n\nWhile this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female\nchoristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was\nengaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste\ncould compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of\nAthelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from\nbaskets of flowers placed before them, garlands, which they intended for\nthe same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if\nnot marked with deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or a smile\ncalled forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might\nbe seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her\nmourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they\nwere preparing. Neither was this propensity (if we must needs confess\nthe truth) at all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights,\nwhich occasioned some looking up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone,\ntoo proud to be vain, paid her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful\ncourtesy. Her demeanour was serious, but not dejected; and it may be\ndoubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his\nfate, did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her\nkinsman.\n\nTo Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably\nclear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so\nmuch deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper\nto whisper the explanation--“She was the affianced bride of the noble\nAthelstane.”--It may be doubted whether this communication went a far\nway to increase Wilfred's disposition to sympathize with the mourners of\nConingsburgh.\n\nHaving thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in\nwhich the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different forms,\nCedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them,\nfor the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight\nconnexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those\nwho were immediately effected by the unhappy event. He assured them of\nevery accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the Black Knight\ntook his hand.\n\n“I crave to remind you, noble Thane,” he said, “that when we last\nparted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you,\nto grant me a boon.”\n\n“It is granted ere named, noble Knight,” said Cedric; “yet, at this sad\nmoment---”\n\n“Of that also,” said the King, “I have bethought me--but my time is\nbrief--neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on\nthe noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and\nhasty opinions.”\n\n“Sir Knight of the Fetterlock,” said Cedric, colouring, and interrupting\nthe King in his turn, “I trust your boon regards yourself and no other;\nfor in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting\nthat a stranger should mingle.”\n\n“Nor do I wish to mingle,” said the King, mildly, “unless in so far as\nyou will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but as\nthe Black Knight of the Fetterlock--Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.”\n\n“Richard of Anjou!” exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost\nastonishment.\n\n“No, noble Cedric--Richard of England!--whose deepest interest--whose\ndeepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.--And, how now,\nworthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?”\n\n“To Norman blood,” said Cedric, “it hath never bended.”\n\n“Reserve thine homage then,” said the Monarch, “until I shall prove my\nright to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.”\n\n“Prince,” answered Cedric, “I have ever done justice to thy bravery\nand thy worth--Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy\ndescent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm\nof Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the\nheir to the monarchy.”\n\n“I will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,” said Richard,\ncalmly; “but I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt\nfind another to be put into the scale against it.”\n\n“And hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?” said Cedric--“To\nupbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has closed o'er\nthe last scion of Saxon royalty?”--His countenance darkened as he\nspoke.--“It was boldly--it was rashly done!”\n\n“Not so, by the holy rood!” replied the King; “it was done in the frank\nconfidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a shadow\nof danger.”\n\n“Thou sayest well, Sir King--for King I own thou art, and wilt be,\ndespite of my feeble opposition.--I dare not take the only mode to\nprevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my\nreach!”\n\n“And now to my boon,” said the King, “which I ask not with one jot\nthe less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful\nsovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being\nheld faithless, man-sworn, and 'nidering', [581] to forgive and receive\nto thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In this\nreconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest--the happiness of my\nfriend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.”\n\n“And this is Wilfred!” said Cedric, pointing to his son.\n\n“My father!--my father!” said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at Cedric's\nfeet, “grant me thy forgiveness!”\n\n“Thou hast it, my son,” said Cedric, raising him up. “The son of\nHereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to\na Norman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English\nancestry--no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my\ndecent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself\nof English ancestry.--Thou art about to speak,” he added, sternly, “and\nI guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two years' mourning, as\nfor a betrothed husband--all our Saxon ancestors would disown us were\nwe to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should\nhave wedded--him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and\nancestry--is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself would burst\nhis bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his\nmemory.”\n\nIt seemed as if Cedric's words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had\nhe uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in\nthe garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like\nsomething arisen from the dead! [59]\n\nThe effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly\nappalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would\npermit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed\non the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth\nwhich he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself,\nrepeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred\nto his memory, while Richard alternately said, “Benedicite”, and swore,\n“Mort de ma vie!”\n\nIn the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,\n“Secure the treacherous monks!”--others, “Down with them into the\ndungeon!”--others, “Pitch them from the highest battlements!”\n\n“In the name of God!” said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of\nhis departed friend, “if thou art mortal, speak!--if a departed spirit,\nsay for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught that can\nset thy spirit at repose.--Living or dead, noble Athelstane, speak to\nCedric!”\n\n“I will,” said the spectre, very composedly, “when I have collected\nbreath, and when you give me time--Alive, saidst thou?--I am as much\nalive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which\nseem three ages--Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By Heaven, and all\nsaints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong\ndays, and by God's providence it is that I am now here to tell it.”\n\n“Why, noble Athelstane,” said the Black Knight, “I myself saw you struck\ndown by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at Torquilstone,\nand as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the\nteeth.”\n\n“You thought amiss, Sir Knight,” said Athelstane, “and Wamba lied. My\nteeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find--No\nthanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that\nthe blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good\nmace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not\nvalued it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have\nspoilt his retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but\nunwounded. Others, of both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered\nabove me, so that I never recovered my senses until I found myself in\na coffin--(an open one, by good luck)--placed before the altar of the\nchurch of Saint Edmund's. I sneezed repeatedly--groaned--awakened and\nwould have arisen, when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came\nrunning at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to find\nthe man alive, whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked\nfor wine--they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for\nI slept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I\nfound my arms swathed down--my feet tied so fast that mine ankles ache\nat the very remembrance--the place was utterly dark--the oubliette, as\nI suppose, of their accursed convent, and from the close, stifled,\ndamp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture. I had\nstrange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my dungeon\ncreaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I\nwas in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of\nthe Father Abbot.--Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which\nhe used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!--the dog has feasted\nwith me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.”\n\n“Have patience, noble Athelstane,” said the King, “take breath--tell\nyour story at leisure--beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth\nlistening to as a romance.”\n\n“Ay but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!”\n said Athelstane.--“A barley loaf and a pitcher of water--that THEY gave\nme, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had enriched,\nwhen their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of\ncorn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange\nfor their prayers--the nest of foul ungrateful vipers--barley bread and\nditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them out of\ntheir nest, though I be excommunicated!”\n\n“But, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,” said Cedric, grasping\nthe hand of his friend, “how didst thou escape this imminent danger--did\ntheir hearts relent?”\n\n“Did their hearts relent!” echoed Athelstane.--“Do rocks melt with the\nsun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the Convent,\nwhich I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast,\nwhen they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the\nswarm out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms,\nlittle judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who\nwere thus famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for\nfood--no wonder--the gouty Sacristan was even too busy with his own\nprovender to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step\nand a strong flavour of wine and spices about his person. Good cheer had\nopened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of wine,\ninstead of my former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated; when, to\nadd to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of\nturnkey fitly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar.\nThe light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to\nwhich my chains were fixed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot\nhad supposed. Even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps\nof that infernal dungeon.”\n\n“Take breath, noble Athelstane,” said Richard, “and partake of some\nrefreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.”\n\n“Partake!” quoth Athelstane; “I have been partaking five times\nto-day--and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign\nto the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of\nwine.”\n\nThe guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their\nresuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:--He had indeed\nnow many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith,\nhaving given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within\nthe Castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger's apartment\nattended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze\ninto the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up\nan erroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more\ninaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar\nwithout, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact.\nAthelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his\nescape:--\n\n“Finding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as\nwell as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might;\nand after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of\na jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it\nso please ye, was holding a devil's mass with a huge beetle-browed,\nbroad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much\nmore like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the\nfashion of my grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made\nme more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both\nstood aghast; but when I knocked down the Sacristan with my fist,\nthe other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge\nquarter-staff.”\n\n“This must be our Friar Tuck, for a count's ransom,” said Richard,\nlooking at Ivanhoe.\n\n“He may be the devil, an he will,” said Athelstane. “Fortunately he\nmissed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his\nheels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by\nmeans of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sexton's belt;\nand I had thoughts of beating out the knave's brains with the bunch of\nkeys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which\nthe rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a\nbrace of hearty kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some baked meat,\nand a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had\nbeen regaling, went to the stable, and found in a private stall mine own\nbest palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father\nAbbot's particular use. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could\ncompass--man and mother's son flying before me wherever I came,\ntaking me for a spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being\nrecognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gained\nadmittance into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be the\nattendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castle-yard\nvery merry, considering they are assembled to celebrate their lord's\nfuneral--I say the sewer thought I was dressed to bear a part in the\ntregetour's mummery, and so I got admission, and did but disclose myself\nto my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere I came in quest of you, my\nnoble friend.”\n\n“And you have found me,” said Cedric, “ready to resume our brave\nprojects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so\nauspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.”\n\n“Talk not to me of delivering any one,” said Athelstane; “it is well I\nam delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain Abbot.\nHe shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and\nstole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will\nhave him craned up from without.”\n\n“But, my son,” said Edith, “consider his sacred office.”\n\n“Consider my three days' fast,” replied Athelstane; “I will have their\nblood every one of them. Front-de-Boeuf was burnt alive for a less\nmatter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much\ngarlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful\nslaves, so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave\nme neither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of\nHengist!”\n\n“But the Pope, my noble friend,”--said Cedric--\n\n“But the devil, my noble friend,”--answered Athelstane; “they die, and\nno more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the world would go\non without them.”\n\n“For shame, noble Athelstane,” said Cedric; “forget such wretches in the\ncareer of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman prince,\nRichard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold\nundisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the Holy\nConfessor lives to dispute it.”\n\n“How!” said Athelstane, “is this the noble King Richard?”\n\n“It is Richard Plantagenet himself,” said Cedric; “yet I need not remind\nthee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be injured\nnor detained prisoner--thou well knowest thy duty to him as his host.”\n\n“Ay, by my faith!” said Athelstane; “and my duty as a subject besides,\nfor I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.”\n\n“My son,” said Edith, “think on thy royal rights!”\n\n“Think on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!” said Cedric.\n\n“Mother and friend,” said Athelstane, “a truce to your\nupbraidings--bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of\nambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into\nit. One half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that\nperfidious Abbot Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to\nbe trusted. Since these plots were set in agitation, I have had nothing\nbut hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments\nand starvation; besides that they can only end in the murder of some\nthousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I will be king in my own domains,\nand nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the\nAbbot.”\n\n“And my ward Rowena,” said Cedric--“I trust you intend not to desert\nher?”\n\n“Father Cedric,” said Athelstane, “be reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares\nnot for me--she loves the little finger of my kinsman Wilfred's glove\nbetter than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it--Nay, blush\nnot, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than\na country franklin--and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for grave-clothes\nand a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of merriment--Nay, an thou\nwilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better jest--Give me thy hand, or\nrather lend it me, for I but ask it in the way of friendship.--Here,\ncousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce and abjure---Hey!\nby Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath vanished!--Yet, unless my eyes\nare still dazzled with the fasting I have undergone, I saw him stand\nthere but even now.”\n\nAll now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished.\nIt was at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that,\nafter very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and\nhad left the castle.\n\n“Fair cousin,” said Athelstane to Rowena, “could I think that this\nsudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the\nweightiest reason, I would myself resume--”\n\nBut he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe\nhad disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely\nembarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the\napartment.\n\n“Certainly,” quoth Athelstane, “women are the least to be trusted of all\nanimals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I expected not\nthanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot--These cursed grave-clothes\nhave surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.--To you I\nturn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a\nliege-subject--”\n\nBut King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it\nwas learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his\npresence the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment's\nspeech with him, had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a\nsteed, compelled the Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which,\naccording to Wamba, rendered the old Jew's neck not worth a penny's\npurchase.\n\n“By my halidome!” said Athelstane, “it is certain that Zernebock\nhath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my\ngrave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one\nI speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!--But it skills not\ntalking of it. Come, my friends--such of you as are left, follow me to\nthe banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear--it is, I trust, as yet\ntolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon noble;\nand should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly off with\nthe supper?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n     Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,\n     That they may break his foaming courser's back,\n     And throw the rider headlong in the lists,\n     A caitiff recreant!\n     --Richard II\n\nOur scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of\nTemplestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the\nlife or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the\nwhole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or\nrural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not\npeculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of\nsingle combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody\nspectacle of brave men falling by each other's hands. Even in our own\ndays, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match,\na riot, or a meeting of radical reformers, collects, at considerable\nhazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators, otherwise little\ninterested, except to see how matters are to be conducted, or whether\nthe heroes of the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors,\nflints or dunghills.\n\nThe eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the\ngate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing\nthe procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the\ntiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on\na piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been\nlevelled with care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports.\nIt occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully\npalisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to\nbe witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied\nwith galleries and benches for their use.\n\nOn the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at\nthe east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors\nand Knights of the Order. Over these floated the sacred standard, called\n“Le Beau-seant”, which was the ensign, as its name was the battle-cry,\nof the Templars.\n\nAt the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged\naround a stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the\nvictim whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal\ncircle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung\nready for that purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black\nslaves, whose colour and African features, then so little known in\nEngland, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them as on demons employed\nabout their own diabolical exercises. These men stirred not, excepting\nnow and then, under the direction of one who seemed their chief, to\nshift and replace the ready fuel. They looked not on the multitude. In\nfact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of every thing save\nthe discharge of their own horrible duty.\n\nAnd when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips,\nand showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the\nexpected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing\nthat they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had\ncommuned, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her\ndreadful punishment. They whispered to each other, and communicated all\nthe feats which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period,\nnot failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his due.\n\n“Have you not heard, Father Dennet,” quoth one boor to another advanced\nin years, “that the devil has carried away bodily the great Saxon Thane,\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh?”\n\n“Ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint\nDunstan.”\n\n“How's that?” said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock\nembroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a\nharp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed\nof no vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered\ndoublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the\n“wrest”, or key, with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a\nsilver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or\nbadge of the baron to whose family he belonged, had barely the word\nSHERWOOD engraved upon it.--“How mean you by that?” said the gay\nMinstrel, mingling in the conversation of the peasants; “I came to seek\none subject for my rhyme, and, by'r Lady, I were glad to find two.”\n\n“It is well avouched,” said the elder peasant, “that after Athelstane of\nConingsburgh had been dead four weeks--”\n\n“That is impossible,” said the Minstrel; “I saw him in life at the\nPassage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.”\n\n“Dead, however, he was, or else translated,” said the younger peasant;\n“for I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund's singing the death's hymn for\nhim; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle\nof Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for Mabel\nParkins, who--”\n\n“Ay, dead was Athelstane,” said the old man, shaking his head, “and the\nmore pity it was, for the old Saxon blood--”\n\n“But, your story, my masters--your story,” said the Minstrel, somewhat\nimpatiently.\n\n“Ay, ay--construe us the story,” said a burly Friar, who stood beside\nthem, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrim's\nstaff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion\nserved,--“Your story,” said the stalwart churchman; “burn not daylight\nabout it--we have short time to spare.”\n\n“An please your reverence,” said Dennet, “a drunken priest came to visit\nthe Sacristan at Saint Edmund's---”\n\n“It does not please my reverence,” answered the churchman, “that there\nshould be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that\na layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the\nholy man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot\nunsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine--I have felt it\nmyself.”\n\n“Well, then,” answered Father Dennet, “a holy brother came to visit the\nSacristan at Saint Edmund's--a sort of hedge-priest is the visitor,\nand kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the\ntinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch\nof bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and\na merry, who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a\nCheshire round, with e'er a man in Yorkshire.”\n\n“That last part of thy speech, Dennet,” said the Minstrel, “has saved\nthee a rib or twain.”\n\n“Tush, man, I fear him not,” said Dennet; “I am somewhat old and stiff,\nbut when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster--”\n\n“But the story--the story, my friend,” again said the Minstrel.\n\n“Why, the tale is but this--Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at\nSaint Edmund's.”\n\n“That's a lie, and a loud one,” said the Friar, “for I saw him borne to\nhis own Castle of Coningsburgh.”\n\n“Nay, then, e'en tell the story yourself, my masters,” said Dennet,\nturning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some\ndifficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of\nhis comrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.--“These two 'sober'\nfriars,” said he at length, “since this reverend man will needs have\nthem such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not,\nfor the best part for a summer's day, when they were aroused by a\ndeep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased\nAthelstane entered the apartment, saying, 'Ye evil shep-herds!--'”\n\n“It is false,” said the Friar, hastily, “he never spoke a word.”\n\n“So ho! Friar Tuck,” said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the\nrustics; “we have started a new hare, I find.”\n\n“I tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,” said the Hermit, “I saw Athelstane of\nConingsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had his\nshroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre--A butt of sack will\nnot wash it out of my memory.”\n\n“Pshaw!” answered the Minstrel; “thou dost but jest with me!”\n\n“Never believe me,” said the Friar, “an I fetched not a knock at him\nwith my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided\nthrough his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!”\n\n“By Saint Hubert,” said the Minstrel, “but it is a wondrous tale, and\nfit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, 'Sorrow came to the old\nFriar.'”\n\n“Laugh, if ye list,” said Friar Tuck; “but an ye catch me singing\non such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him\nheadlong! No, no--I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some\ngood work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the\nlike matter of godly service, and therefore am I here.”\n\nAs they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of\nTemplestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance\nfrom the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen\nsounds fell successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient space\nfor each to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again filled\nby repetition of the iron knell. These sounds, the signal of the\napproaching ceremony, chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled\nmultitude, whose eyes were now turned to the Preceptory, expecting the\napproach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the criminal.\n\nAt length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing\nthe great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by\nsix trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the\nGrand Master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture\nwas of the simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed\ncap-a-pie in bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword,\nwhich were borne by his two esquires behind him. His face, though partly\nhidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrel-cap, bore\na strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed to\ncontend with irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not\nslept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the\nhabitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the\nTemple. His general appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking at\nhim with attention, men read that in his dark features, from which they\nwillingly withdrew their eyes.\n\nOn either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin,\nwho acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes\nof peace, the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other\nCompanions of the Temple, with a long train of esquires and pages clad\nin black, aspirants to the honour of being one day Knights of the Order.\nAfter these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot, in the same\nsable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the\naccused, moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the scene of her\nfate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance there should\nbe among them some of those amulets which Satan was supposed to bestow\nupon his victims, to deprive them of the power of confession even when\nunder the torture. A coarse white dress, of the simplest form, had been\nsubstituted for her Oriental garments; yet there was such an exquisite\nmixture of courage and resignation in her look, that even in this garb,\nand with no other ornament than her long black tresses, each eye wept\nthat looked upon her, and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate\nthat had converted a creature so goodly into a vessel of wrath, and a\nwaged slave of the devil.\n\nA crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the\nvictim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks\nbent upon the ground.\n\nThis slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of\nwhich was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around\nthem from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a\nhalt. There was then a momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all\nhis attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted\nfrom their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by\nthe esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.\n\nThe unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the\npile. On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were\nmaking for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the\nbody, she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally\ndoubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space\nof a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to\nfamiliarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally\nturned away her head.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry\nof his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank,\na loud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court\nwere seated for judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the\nchampion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was\nthe pledge of battle, at the feet of the Grand Master.\n\n“Valorous Lord, and reverend Father,” said he, “here standeth the good\nKnight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the\nTemple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your\nreverence's feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this\nday, to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly\ndeserved the doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order\nof the Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;--here, I\nsay, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be\nyour noble and sanctified pleasure.”\n\n“Hath he made oath,” said the Grand Master, “that his quarrel is just\nand honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the 'Te igitur'.”\n\n“Sir, and most reverend father,” answered Malvoisin, readily, “our\nbrother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation\nin the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise he\nought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and\nmay take no oath.”\n\nThis explanation was satisfactory, to Albert's great joy; for the wily\nknight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of\nprevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the\nassembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his\ndoing so.\n\nThe Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin,\ncommanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets\nthen again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed\naloud,--“Oyez, oyez, oyez.--Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian\nde Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who\nwill sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to\ntry by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to\nsuch champion the reverend and valorous Grand Master here present allows\na fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else\nappertains to a fair combat.” The trumpets again sounded, and there was\na dead pause of many minutes.\n\n“No champion appears for the appellant,” said the Grand Master. “Go,\nherald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her\nin this her cause.” The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was\nseated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse's head toward that\nend of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and\nMont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebecca's chair as soon as the herald.\n\n“Is this regular, and according to the law of combat?” said Malvoisin,\nlooking to the Grand Master.\n\n“Albert de Malvoisin, it is,” answered Beaumanoir; “for in this appeal\nto the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having that\ncommunication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the\ntruth of the quarrel.”\n\nIn the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms:--“Damsel,\nthe Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demands of thee, if thou\nart prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if\nthou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?”\n\n“Say to the Grand Master,” replied Rebecca, “that I maintain my\ninnocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become guilty\nof mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms\nwill permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is in man's extremity,\nwill raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed,\nmay His holy will be done!” The herald retired to carry this answer to\nthe Grand Master.\n\n“God forbid,” said Lucas Beaumanoir, “that Jew or Pagan should impeach\nus of injustice!--Until the shadows be cast from the west to the\neastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this\nunfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for\ndeath.”\n\nThe herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who\nbowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards\nheaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce\npromise herself from man. During this awful pause, the voice of\nBois-Guilbert broke upon her ear--it was but a whisper, yet it startled\nher more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.\n\n“Rebecca,” said the Templar, “dost thou hear me?”\n\n“I have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,” said the\nunfortunate maiden.\n\n“Ay, but dost thou understand my words?” said the Templar; “for the\nsound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know on what\nground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.--This\nlisted space--that chair--these faggots--I know their purpose, and yet\nit appears to me like something unreal--the fearful picture of a vision,\nwhich appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my\nreason.”\n\n“My mind and senses keep touch and time,” answered Rebecca, “and tell\nme alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body, and\nopen a painful but a brief passage to a better world.”\n\n“Dreams, Rebecca,--dreams,” answered the Templar; “idle visions,\nrejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me, Rebecca,”\n he said, proceeding with animation; “a better chance hast thou for life\nand liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee behind me\non my steed--on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider.\nI won him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond--mount, I say,\nbehind me--in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind--a new\nworld of pleasure opens to thee--to me a new career of fame. Let them\nspeak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert from\ntheir list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood whatever blot\nthey may dare to cast on my scutcheon.”\n\n“Tempter,” said Rebecca, “begone!--Not in this last extremity canst thou\nmove me one hair's-breadth from my resting place--surrounded as I am by\nfoes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy--avoid thee, in the\nname of God!”\n\nAlbert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their\nconference, now advanced to interrupt it.\n\n“Hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?” he demanded of Bois-Guilbert;\n“or is she resolute in her denial?”\n\n“She is indeed resolute,” said Bois-Guilbert.\n\n“Then,” said Malvoisin, “must thou, noble brother, resume thy place\nto attend the issue--The shades are changing on the circle of the\ndial--Come, brave Bois-Guilbert--come, thou hope of our holy Order, and\nsoon to be its head.”\n\nAs he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight's\nbridle, as if to lead him back to his station.\n\n“False villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?” said Sir\nBrian, angrily. And shaking off his companion's grasp, he rode back to\nthe upper end of the lists.\n\n“There is yet spirit in him,” said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet,\n“were it well directed--but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever\napproaches it.”\n\nThe Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the\nappearance of a champion.\n\n“And reason good,” said Friar Tuck, “seeing she is a Jewess--and yet,\nby mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should\nperish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times\na witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my\nquarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce\nTemplar, ere he carried the matter off thus.”\n\nIt was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear\nfor a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by\nMalvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the\npledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging his horse\nto speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. A\nhundred voices exclaimed, “A champion! a champion!” And despite the\nprepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously\nas the knight rode into the tiltyard. The second glance, however, served\nto destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited. His horse,\nurged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared to reel from fatigue,\nand the rider, however undauntedly he presented himself in the lists,\neither from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed scarce able to support\nhimself in the saddle.\n\nTo the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and\npurpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, “I am a good\nknight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just\nand lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York;\nto uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and\nto defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as\nI will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of God,\nof Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good knight.”\n\n“The stranger must first show,” said Malvoisin, “that he is good knight,\nand of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her champions\nagainst nameless men.”\n\n“My name,” said the Knight, raising his helmet, “is better known, my\nlineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.”\n\n“I will not fight with thee at present,” said the Templar, in a changed\nand hollow voice. “Get thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse,\nand it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this\nboyish spirit of bravado.”\n\n“Ha! proud Templar,” said Ivanhoe, “hast thou forgotten that twice didst\nthou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre--remember the\nPassage of Arms at Ashby--remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of\nRotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that\nthou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour\nthou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I\nwill proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe--in every\nPreceptory of thine Order--unless thou do battle without farther delay.”\n\nBois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and\nthen exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, “Dog of a Saxon! take thy\nlance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!”\n\n“Does the Grand Master allow me the combat?” said Ivanhoe.\n\n“I may not deny what thou hast challenged,” said the Grand Master,\n“provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou\nwert in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever\nbeen, yet would I have thee honourably met with.”\n\n“Thus--thus as I am, and not otherwise,” said Ivanhoe; “it is the\njudgment of God--to his keeping I commend myself.--Rebecca,” said he,\nriding up to the fatal chair, “dost thou accept of me for thy champion?”\n\n“I do,” she said--“I do,” fluttered by an emotion which the fear of\ndeath had been unable to produce, “I do accept thee as the champion whom\nHeaven hath sent me. Yet, no--no--thy wounds are uncured--Meet not that\nproud man--why shouldst thou perish also?”\n\nBut Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and\nassumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked,\nas he clasped his visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the\nvariety of emotions by which he had been agitated, continued during the\nwhole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much\nflushed.\n\nThe herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice,\nrepeating thrice--“Faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!” After the\nthird cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed,\nthat none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or\naction, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. The\nGrand Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca's glove,\nnow threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words,\n“Laissez aller”.\n\nThe trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career.\nThe wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went\ndown, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous\nsteed of the Templar. This issue of the combat all had foreseen; but\nalthough the spear of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield\nof Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to the astonishment of all who beheld\nit reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell in the lists.\n\nIvanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot,\nhastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose\nnot. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the sword's point\nto his throat, commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot.\nBois-Guilbert returned no answer.\n\n“Slay him not, Sir Knight,” cried the Grand Master, “unshriven and\nunabsolved--kill not body and soul! We allow him vanquished.”\n\nHe descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered\nchampion. His eyes were closed--the dark red flush was still on his\nbrow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened--but they\nwere fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to\nthe pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had\ndied a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.\n\n“This is indeed the judgment of God,” said the Grand Master, looking\nupwards--“'Fiat voluntas tua!'”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n     So! now 'tis ended, like an old wife's story.\n     Webster\n\nWhen the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe\ndemanded of the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully\nand rightfully done his duty in the combat? “Manfully and rightfully hath\nit been done,” said the Grand Master. “I pronounce the maiden free and\nguiltless--The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will\nof the victor.”\n\n“I will not despoil him of his weapons,” said the Knight of Ivanhoe,\n“nor condemn his corpse to shame--he hath fought for Christendom--God's\narm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his\nobsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust\nquarrel.--And for the maiden--”\n\nHe was interrupted by a clattering of horses' feet, advancing in such\nnumbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the\nBlack Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band\nof men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.\n\n“I am too late,” he said, looking around him. “I had doomed\nBois-Guilbert for mine own property.--Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on\nthee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?”\n\n“Heaven, my Liege,” answered Ivanhoe, “hath taken this proud man for its\nvictim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed.”\n\n“Peace be with him,” said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse,\n“if it may be so--he was a gallant knight, and has died in his steel\nharness full knightly. But we must waste no time--Bohun, do thine\noffice!”\n\nA Knight stepped forward from the King's attendants, and, laying his\nhand on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, “I arrest thee of\nHigh Treason.”\n\nThe Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so\nmany warriors.--He now spoke.\n\n“Who dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth\nof his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by\nwhose authority is this bold outrage offered?”\n\n“I make the arrest,” replied the Knight--“I, Henry Bohun, Earl of Essex,\nLord High Constable of England.”\n\n“And he arrests Malvoisin,” said the King, raising his visor, “by the\norder of Richard Plantagenet, here present.--Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it\nis well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.--But for thee,\nMalvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a week\nolder.”\n\n“I will resist thy doom,” said the Grand Master.\n\n“Proud Templar,” said the King, “thou canst not--look up, and behold the\nRoyal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of thy Temple\nbanner!--Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition--Thy hand\nis in the lion's mouth.”\n\n“I will appeal to Rome against thee,” said the Grand Master, “for\nusurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.”\n\n“Be it so,” said the King; “but for thine own sake tax me not with\nusurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to\nthy next Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made\nthe scene of treasonable conspiracy against the King of England--Or, if\nthou wilt, remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.”\n\n“To be a guest in the house where I should command?” said the\nTemplar; “never!--Chaplains, raise the Psalm, 'Quare fremuerunt\nGentes?'--Knights, squires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to\nfollow the banner of 'Beau-seant!'”\n\nThe Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of\nEngland's king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and\ndismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the\nwatch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not\nthe timidity of the scared flock--there were dark brows of defiance, and\nlooks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words.\nThey drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks\nof the knights were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers,\nlike the lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had\nraised a clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence\non the formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade\ndefiance, and shrunk back from their front.\n\nThe Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force,\ndashed the rowels into his charger's sides, and galloped backwards and\nforwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable.\nRichard alone, as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked,\nrode slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, “What, sirs!\nAmong so many gallant knights, will none dare splinter a spear with\nRichard?--Sirs of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they\nare not worth the shiver of a broken lance?”\n\n“The Brethren of the Temple,” said the Grand Master, riding forward in\nadvance of their body, “fight not on such idle and profane quarrel--and\nnot with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my\npresence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel, and\nwhether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which\nthou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To\nthine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which\nwe leave behind us, and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence\nthou hast this day given to Christendom.”\n\nWith these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the\nsignal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an Oriental\ncharacter, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance.\nThey changed their array from a line to a column of march, and moved off\nas slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was only the will\nof their Grand Master, and no fear of the opposing and superior force,\nwhich compelled them to withdraw.\n\n“By the splendour of Our Lady's brow!” said King Richard, “it is pity\nof their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they are\ndisciplined and valiant.”\n\nThe multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of\nits challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of\nthe squadron left the ground.\n\nDuring the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca\nsaw and heard nothing--she was locked in the arms of her aged father,\ngiddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances\naround her. But one word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered\nfeelings.\n\n“Let us go,” he said, “my dear daughter, my recovered treasure--let us\ngo to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.”\n\n“Not so,” said Rebecca, “O no--no--no--I must not at this moment dare\nto speak to him--Alas! I should say more than--No, my father, let us\ninstantly leave this evil place.”\n\n“But, my daughter,” said Isaac, “to leave him who hath come forth like a\nstrong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so\nhe might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a\npeople strange unto him and his--this is service to be thankfully\nacknowledged.”\n\n“It is--it is--most thankfully--most devoutly acknowledged,” said\nRebecca--“it shall be still more so--but not now--for the sake of thy\nbeloved Rachel, father, grant my request--not now!”\n\n“Nay, but,” said Isaac, insisting, “they will deem us more thankless\nthan mere dogs!”\n\n“But thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and\nthat---”\n\n“True, my best--my wisest Rebecca!--Let us hence--let us hence!--Money\nhe will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine, and, as they say,\nfrom prison--and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise\nout of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us\nhence!”\n\nAnd hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists,\nand by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely\nto the house of the Rabbi Nathan.\n\nThe Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the\nday, having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was\ntransferred to the Black Knight. They now filled the air with “Long life\nto Richard with the Lion's Heart, and down with the usurping Templars!”\n\n“Notwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,” said Ivanhoe to the Earl of\nEssex, “it was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with him,\nnoble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.”\n\nThe Earl smiled and shook his head.\n\n“Gallant Ivanhoe,” said Essex, “dost thou know our Master so well, and\nyet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards\nYork having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met\nKing Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in\nhis own person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with\nhis own single arm. I accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his\nconsent.”\n\n“And what news from York, brave Earl?” said Ivanhoe; “will the rebels\nbide us there?”\n\n“No more than December's snow will bide July's sun,” said the Earl;\n“they are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring us the news,\nbut John himself!”\n\n“The traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!” said Ivanhoe; “did not\nRichard order him into confinement?”\n\n“O! he received him,” answered the Earl, “as if they had met after a\nhunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said, 'Thou\nseest, brother, I have some angry men with me--thou wert best go to our\nmother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until men's\nminds are pacified.'”\n\n“And this was all he said?” enquired Ivanhoe; “would not any one say\nthat this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?”\n\n“Just,” replied the Earl, “as the man may be said to invite death, who\nundertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound unhealed.”\n\n“I forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,” said Ivanhoe; “but, remember, I\nhazarded but my own life--Richard, the welfare of his kingdom.”\n\n“Those,” replied Essex, “who are specially careless of their own\nwelfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others--But let\nus haste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the\nsubordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their\nprincipal.”\n\nFrom the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and\nwhich are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that\nMaurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of\nPhilip of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert, the\nPreceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the\nsoul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and Prince John,\nfor whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his\ngood-natured brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the two\nMalvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well\ndeserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.\n\nBriefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the\ncourt of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that\nhad been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at\nYork. Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message--but he\nrefused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every\nhope that he had entertained of restoring a Saxon dynasty in England;\nfor, whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of a civil\nwar, it was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed\ndominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities\nand military fame, although his administration was wilfully careless,\nnow too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.\n\nBut, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric's reluctant observation,\nthat his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the marriage\nof Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual\ndissent of both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event which, in\nhis ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even\nwhen the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he\ncould scarce bring himself to believe that two Saxons of royal descent\nshould scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the\npublic weal of the nation. But it was not the less certain: Rowena had\nalways expressed her repugnance to Athelstane, and now Athelstane was\nno less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue\nhis addresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric\nsunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of\njunction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with\neach hand. He made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and\nhe found that resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country\nsquires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.\n\nIt seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint\nEdmund's, Athelstane's spirit of revenge, what between the natural\nindolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of\nhis mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the\nclerical order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in\nthe dungeons of Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For this\natrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a\ndreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by\nhimself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust\nimprisonment they had sustained. With this controversy, and with the\nmeans he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric\nfound the mind of his friend Athelstane so fully occupied, that it had\nno room for another idea. And when Rowena's name was mentioned the noble\nAthelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that\nshe might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a desperate\ncase therefore. There was obviously no more to be made of Athelstane;\nor, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended from Saxon\ntimes to ours, he was a cock that would not fight.\n\nThere remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers\ndesired to come to, only two obstacles--his own obstinacy, and his\ndislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way\nbefore the endearments of his ward, and the pride which he could not\nhelp nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible\nto the honour of allying his own line to that of Alfred, when the\nsuperior claims of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were abandoned\nfor ever. Cedric's aversion to the Norman race of kings was also much\nundermined,--first, by consideration of the impossibility of ridding\nEngland of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create loyalty\nin the subject to the king “de facto”; and, secondly, by the personal\nattention of King Richard, who delighted in the blunt humour of Cedric,\nand, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt with the\nnoble Saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he\nhad given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and his son\nWilfred of Ivanhoe.\n\nThe nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were\ncelebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York.\nThe King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on\nthis and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded Saxons,\ngave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just\nrights, than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of\na civil war. The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all\nthe splendour which she of Rome knows how to apply with such brilliant\neffect.\n\nGurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master\nwhom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated\nwith a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of\nWilfred's dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to\nexpect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.\n\nBut besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were\ncelebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as\nSaxons, joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that\nmarked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace\nand harmony betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so\ncompletely mingled, that the distinction has become wholly invisible.\nCedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion; for\nas the two nations mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each\nother, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons were refined from\ntheir rusticity. But it was not until the reign of Edward the Third\nthat the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court\nof London, and that the hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems\nentirely to have disappeared.\n\nIt was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady\nRowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel\ndesired admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley might\nbe without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated, became curious, and\nended by commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants to\nwithdraw.\n\nShe entered--a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil,\nin which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the\nelegance and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect,\nunmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate\nfavour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to\nthe feelings, of others. She arose, and would have conducted her\nlovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again\nintimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no\nsooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady\nof Ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to\nher forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena's\nresistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.\n\n“What means this, lady?” said the surprised bride; “or why do you offer\nto me a deference so unusual?”\n\n“Because to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,” said Rebecca, rising up and resuming\nthe usual quiet dignity of her manner, “I may lawfully, and without\nrebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\nI am--forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my\ncountry--I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his\nlife against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.”\n\n“Damsel,” said Rowena, “Wilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back but\nin slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and\nmisfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can serve\nthee?”\n\n“Nothing,” said Rebecca, calmly, “unless you will transmit to him my\ngrateful farewell.”\n\n“You leave England then?” said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of\nthis extraordinary visit.\n\n“I leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother\nhigh in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada--thither we go,\nsecure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the\nMoslem exact from our people.”\n\n“And are you not then as well protected in England?” said Rowena.\n“My husband has favour with the King--the King himself is just and\ngenerous.”\n\n“Lady,” said Rebecca, “I doubt it not--but the people of England are a\nfierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves,\nand ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such is\nno safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is an heartless\ndove--Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two\nburdens. Not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by hostile\nneighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can Israel hope to rest\nduring her wanderings.”\n\n“But you, maiden,” said Rowena--“you surely can have nothing to fear.\nShe who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,” she continued, rising with\nenthusiasm--“she can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and\nNorman will contend who shall most do her honour.”\n\n“Thy speech is fair, lady,” said Rebecca, “and thy purpose fairer; but\nit may not be--there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our faith,\nalike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell--yet, ere I go indulge me\none request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it, and\nlet me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.”\n\n“They are scarce worthy of being looked upon,” said Rowena; “but,\nexpecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.”\n\nShe took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of\nbeauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek,\nbrow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also,\nbut it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past\nslowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour\nwhen the sun sinks beneath the horizon.\n\n“Lady,” she said, “the countenance you have deigned to show me will long\ndwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and goodness; and\nif a tinge of the world's pride or vanities may mix with an expression\nso lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some\ncolour of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and\nbless God that I leave my noble deliverer united with--”\n\nShe stopped short--her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped them,\nand answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena--“I am well, lady--well.\nBut my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists of\nTemplestowe.--Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my duty, remains\nundischarged. Accept this casket--startle not at its contents.”\n\nRowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet,\nor neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of\nimmense value.\n\n“It is impossible,” she said, tendering back the casket. “I dare not\naccept a gift of such consequence.”\n\n“Yet keep it, lady,” returned Rebecca.--“You have power, rank, command,\ninfluence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and weakness;\nthe value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not influence half\nso much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the gift is of little\nvalue,--and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let me not think\nyou deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe. Think\nye that I prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty?\nor that my father values them in comparison to the honour of his only\nchild? Accept them, lady--to me they are valueless. I will never wear\njewels more.”\n\n“You are then unhappy!” said Rowena, struck with the manner in which\nRebecca uttered the last words. “O, remain with us--the counsel of holy\nmen will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to you.”\n\n“No, lady,” answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her\nsoft voice and beautiful features--“that--may not be. I may not change\nthe faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in\nwhich I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I\ndedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.”\n\n“Have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?” asked\nRowena.\n\n“No, lady,” said the Jewess; “but among our people, since the time of\nAbraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to\nHeaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the\nsick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will\nRebecca be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire\nafter the fate of her whose life he saved.”\n\nThere was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca's voice, and a tenderness\nof accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have\nexpressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.\n\n“Farewell,” she said. “May He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower\ndown on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us hence will be\nunder weigh ere we can reach the port.”\n\nShe glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision\nhad passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference to\nher husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and\nhappily with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the\nbonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the\nrecollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it\nwould be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection\nof Rebecca's beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more\nfrequently than the fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have\napproved.\n\nIvanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced\nwith farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still\nhigher, but for the premature death of the heroic Coeur-de-Lion, before\nthe Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With the life of a generous, but\nrash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition\nand his generosity had formed; to whom may be applied, with a slight\nalteration, the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden--\n\n     His fate was destined to a foreign strand,\n     A petty fortress and an “humble” hand;\n     He left the name at which the world grew pale,\n     To point a moral, or adorn a TALE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER I.\n\nNote A.--The Ranger or the Forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs.\n\nA most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the Forest Laws.\nThese oppressive enactments were the produce of the Norman Conquest,\nfor the Saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane; while those of\nWilliam, enthusiastically attached to the exercise and its rights, were\nto the last degree tyrannical. The formation of the New Forest, bears\nevidence to his passion for hunting, where he reduced many a happy\nvillage to the condition of that one commemorated by my friend, Mr\nWilliam Stewart Rose:\n\n     “Amongst the ruins of the church\n     The midnight raven found a perch,\n     A melancholy place;\n     The ruthless Conqueror cast down,\n     Woe worth the deed, that little town,\n     To lengthen out his chase.”\n\nThe disabling dogs, which might be necessary for keeping flocks and\nherds, from running at the deer, was called “lawing”, and was in general\nuse. The Charter of the Forest designed to lessen those evils, declares\nthat inquisition, or view, for lawing dogs, shall be made every third\nyear, and shall be then done by the view and testimony of lawful men,\nnot otherwise; and they whose dogs shall be then found unlawed, shall\ngive three shillings for mercy, and for the future no man's ox shall be\ntaken for lawing. Such lawing also shall be done by the assize commonly\nused, and which is, that three claws shall be cut off without the ball\nof the right foot. See on this subject the Historical Essay on the Magna\nCharta of King John, (a most beautiful volume), by Richard Thomson.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER II.\n\nNote B.--Negro Slaves.\n\nThe severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of\nthe slaves of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as being totally out of costume\nand propriety. I remember the same objection being made to a set of\nsable functionaries, whom my friend, Mat Lewis, introduced as the\nguards and mischief-doing satellites of the wicked Baron, in his Castle\nSpectre. Mat treated the objection with great contempt, and averred\nin reply, that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking\neffect of contrast, and that, could he have derived a similar advantage\nfrom making his heroine blue, blue she should have been.\n\nI do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this;\nbut neither will I allow that the author of a modern antique romance\nis obliged to confine himself to the introduction of those manners\nonly which can be proved to have absolutely existed in the times he\nis depicting, so that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and\nnatural, and contain no obvious anachronism. In this point of view,\nwhat can be more natural, than that the Templars, who, we know, copied\nclosely the luxuries of the Asiatic warriors with whom they fought,\nshould use the service of the enslaved Africans, whom the fate of war\ntransferred to new masters? I am sure, if there are no precise proofs\nof their having done so, there is nothing, on the other hand, that can\nentitle us positively to conclude that they never did. Besides, there is\nan instance in romance.\n\nJohn of Rampayne, an excellent juggler and minstrel, undertook to effect\nthe escape of one Audulf de Bracy, by presenting himself in disguise\nat the court of the king, where he was confined. For this purpose, “he\nstained his hair and his whole body entirely as black as jet, so that\nnothing was white but his teeth,” and succeeded in imposing himself\non the king, as an Ethiopian minstrel. He effected, by stratagem, the\nescape of the prisoner. Negroes, therefore, must have been known in\nEngland in the dark ages. [60]\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XVII.\n\nNote C.--Minstrelsy.\n\nThe realm of France, it is well known, was divided betwixt the Norman\nand Teutonic race, who spoke the language in which the word Yes is\npronounced as “oui”, and the inhabitants of the southern regions, whose\nspeech bearing some affinity to the Italian, pronounced the same word\n“oc”. The poets of the former race were called “Minstrels”, and their\npoems “Lays”: those of the latter were termed “Troubadours”, and their\ncompositions called “sirventes”, and other names. Richard, a professed\nadmirer of the joyous science in all its branches, could imitate either\nthe minstrel or troubadour. It is less likely that he should have been\nable to compose or sing an English ballad; yet so much do we wish to\nassimilate Him of the Lion Heart to the band of warriors whom he led,\nthat the anachronism, if there be one may readily be forgiven.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXI.\n\nNote D.--Battle of Stamford.\n\nA great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions. The\nbloody battle alluded to in the text, fought and won by King Harold,\nover his brother the rebellious Tosti, and an auxiliary force of Danes\nor Norsemen, was said, in the text, and a corresponding note, to have\ntaken place at Stamford, in Leicestershire, and upon the river Welland.\nThis is a mistake, into which the author has been led by trusting to his\nmemory, and so confounding two places of the same name. The Stamford,\nStrangford, or Staneford, at which the battle really was fought, is a\nford upon the river Derwent, at the distance of about seven miles from\nYork, and situated in that large and opulent county. A long wooden\nbridge over the Derwent, the site of which, with one remaining buttress,\nis still shown to the curious traveller, was furiously contested. One\nNorwegian long defended it by his single arm, and was at length pierced\nwith a spear thrust through the planks of the bridge from a boat\nbeneath.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Stamford, on the Derwent, contains some memorials\nof the battle. Horseshoes, swords, and the heads of halberds, or bills,\nare often found there; one place is called the “Danes' well,” another\nthe “Battle flats.” From a tradition that the weapon with which the\nNorwegian champion was slain, resembled a pear, or, as others say, that\nthe trough or boat in which the soldier floated under the bridge to\nstrike the blow, had such a shape, the country people usually begin a\ngreat market, which is held at Stamford, with an entertainment called\nthe Pear-pie feast, which after all may be a corruption of the Spear-pie\nfeast. For more particulars, Drake's History of York may be referred\nto. The author's mistake was pointed out to him, in the most obliging\nmanner, by Robert Belt, Esq. of Bossal House. The battle was fought in\n1066.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXII.\n\nNote E.--The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal.\n\nThis horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which\nthe Spaniards subjected Guatimozin, in order to extort a discovery of\nhis concealed wealth. But, in fact, an instance of similar barbarity is\nto be found nearer home, and occurs in the annals of Queen Mary's\ntime, containing so many other examples of atrocity. Every reader\nmust recollect, that after the fall of the Catholic Church, and the\nPresbyterian Church Government had been established by law, the rank,\nand especially the wealth, of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and so forth,\nwere no longer vested in ecclesiastics, but in lay impropriators of the\nchurch revenues, or, as the Scottish lawyers called them, titulars\nof the temporalities of the benefice, though having no claim to the\nspiritual character of their predecessors in office.\n\nOf these laymen, who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues,\nsome were men of high birth and rank, like the famous Lord James\nStewart, the Prior of St Andrews, who did not fail to keep for their own\nuse the rents, lands, and revenues of the church. But if, on the\nother hand, the titulars were men of inferior importance, who had been\ninducted into the office by the interest of some powerful person, it was\ngenerally understood that the new Abbot should grant for his patron's\nbenefit such leases and conveyances of the church lands and tithes as\nmight afford their protector the lion's share of the booty. This was the\norigin of those who were wittily termed Tulchan [61]\n\nBishops, being a sort of imaginary prelate, whose image was set up to\nenable his patron and principal to plunder the benefice under his name.\n\nThere were other cases, however, in which men who had got grants of\nthese secularised benefices, were desirous of retaining them for their\nown use, without having the influence sufficient to establish their\npurpose; and these became frequently unable to protect themselves,\nhowever unwilling to submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of the\ndistrict.\n\nBannatyne, secretary to John Knox, recounts a singular course of\noppression practised on one of those titulars abbots, by the Earl of\nCassilis in Ayrshire, whose extent of feudal influence was so wide that\nhe was usually termed the King of Carrick. We give the fact as it occurs\nin Bannatyne's Journal, only premising that the Journalist held his\nmaster's opinions, both with respect to the Earl of Cassilis as an\nopposer of the king's party, and as being a detester of the practice of\ngranting church revenues to titulars, instead of their being devoted to\npious uses, such as the support of the clergy, expense of schools, and\nthe relief of the national poor. He mingles in the narrative, therefore,\na well deserved feeling of execration against the tyrant who employed\nthe torture, which a tone of ridicule towards the patient, as if, after\nall, it had not been ill bestowed on such an equivocal and amphibious\ncharacter as a titular abbot. He entitles his narrative,\n\nTHE EARL OF CASSILIS' TYRANNY AGAINST A QUICK (i.e. LIVING) MAN.\n\n“Master Allan Stewart, friend to Captain James Stewart of Cardonall, by\nmeans of the Queen's corrupted court, obtained the Abbey of Crossraguel.\nThe said Earl thinking himself greater than any king in those quarters,\ndetermined to have that whole benefice (as he hath divers others) to\npay at his pleasure; and because he could not find sic security as his\ninsatiable appetite required, this shift was devised. The said Mr Allan\nbeing in company with the Laird of Bargany, (also a Kennedy,) was, by\nthe Earl and his friends, enticed to leave the safeguard which he had\nwith the Laird, and come to make good cheer with the said Earl. The\nsimplicity of the imprudent man was suddenly abused; and so he passed\nhis time with them certain days, which he did in Maybole with Thomas\nKennedie, uncle to the said Earl; after which the said Mr Allan passed,\nwith quiet company, to visit the place and bounds of Crossraguel, [his\nabbacy,] of which the said Earl being surely advertised, determined to\nput in practice the tyranny which long before he had conceived. And so,\nas king of the country, apprehended the said Mr Allan, and carried him\nto the house of Denure, where for a season he was honourably treated,\n(if a prisoner can think any entertainment pleasing;) but after that\ncertain days were spent, and that the Earl could not obtain the feus of\nCrossraguel according to his own appetite, he determined to prove if a\ncollation could work that which neither dinner nor supper could do for\na long time. And so the said Mr Allan was carried to a secret chamber:\nwith him passed the honourable Earl, his worshipful brother, and such as\nwere appointed to be servants at that banquet. In the chamber there was\na grit iron chimlay, under it a fire; other grit provision was not seen.\nThe first course was,--'My Lord Abbot,' (said the Earl,) 'it will please\nyou confess here, that with your own consent you remain in my company,\nbecause ye durst not commit yourself to the hands of others.' The Abbot\nanswered, 'Would you, my lord, that I should make a manifest lie for\nyour pleasure? The truth is, my lord, it is against my will that I am\nhere; neither yet have I any pleasure in your company.' 'But ye shall\nremain with me, nevertheless, at this time,' said the Earl. 'I am not\nable to resist your will and pleasure,' said the Abbot, 'in this place.'\n'Ye must then obey me,' said the Earl,--and with that were presented\nunto him certain letters to subscribe, amongst which there was a five\nyears' tack, and a nineteen years' tack, and a charter of feu of all the\nlands (of Crossraguel), with all the clauses necessary for the Earl to\nhaste him to hell. For if adultery, sacrilege, oppression, barbarous\ncruelty, and theft heaped upon theft, deserve hell, the great King\nof Carrick can no more escape hell for ever, than the imprudent Abbot\nescaped the fire for a season as follows.\n\n“After that the Earl spied repugnance, and saw that he could not come\nto his purpose by fair means, he commanded his cooks to prepare the\nbanquet: and so first they flayed the sheep, that is, they took off\nthe Abbot's cloathes even to his skin, and next they bound him to the\nchimney--his legs to the one end, and his arms to the other; and so they\nbegan to beet [i.e. feed] the fire sometimes to his buttocks, sometimes\nto his legs, sometimes to his shoulders and arms; and that the roast\nmight not burn, but that it might rest in soppe, they spared not\nflambing with oil, (basting as a cook bastes roasted meat); Lord, look\nthou to sic cruelty! And that the crying of the miserable man should not\nbe heard, they dosed his mouth that the voice might be stopped. It may\nbe suspected that some partisan of the King's [Darnley's] murder was\nthere. In that torment they held the poor man, till that often he cried\nfor God's sake to dispatch him; for he had as meikle gold in his awin\npurse as would buy powder enough to shorten his pain. The famous King of\nCarrick and his cooks perceiving the roast to be aneuch, commanded it\nto be tane fra the fire, and the Earl himself began the grace in this\nmanner:--'Benedicite, Jesus Maria, you are the most obstinate man that\never I saw; gif I had known that ye had been so stubborn, I would not\nfor a thousand crowns have handled you so; I never did so to man before\nyou.' And yet he returned to the same practice within two days, and\nceased not till that he obtained his formost purpose, that is, that\nhe had got all his pieces subscryvit alsweill as ane half-roasted hand\ncould do it. The Earl thinking himself sure enough so long as he had\nthe half-roasted Abbot in his own keeping, and yet being ashamed of his\npresence by reason of his former cruelty, left the place of Denure in\nthe hands of certain of his servants, and the half-roasted Abbot to be\nkept there as prisoner. The Laird of Bargany, out of whose company the\nsaid Abbot had been enticed, understanding, (not the extremity,) but\nthe retaining of the man, sent to the court, and raised letters of\ndeliverance of the person of the man according to the order, which being\ndisobeyed, the said Earl for his contempt was denounced rebel, and put\nto the horne. But yet hope was there none, neither to the afflicted\nto be delivered, neither yet to the purchaser [i.e. procurer] of\nthe letters to obtain any comfort thereby; for in that time God was\ndespised, and the lawful authority was contemned in Scotland, in hope\nof the sudden return and regiment of that cruel murderer of her awin\nhusband, of whose lords the said Earl was called one; and yet, oftener\nthan once, he was solemnly sworn to the King and to his Regent.”\n\nThe Journalist then recites the complaint of the injured Allan Stewart,\nCommendator of Crossraguel, to the Regent and Privy Council, averring\nhis having been carried, partly by flattery, partly by force, to the\nblack vault of Denure, a strong fortalice, built on a rock overhanging\nthe Irish channel, where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole\nchurches and parsonages belonging to the Abbey of Crossraguel, which he\nutterly refused as an unreasonable demand, and the more so that he had\nalready conveyed them to John Stewart of Cardonah, by whose interest he\nhad been made Commendator. The complainant proceeds to state, that he\nwas, after many menaces, stript, bound, and his limbs exposed to fire\nin the manner already described, till, compelled by excess of agony, he\nsubscribed the charter and leases presented to him, of the contents\nof which he was totally ignorant. A few days afterwards, being again\nrequired to execute a ratification of these deeds before a notary and\nwitnesses, and refusing to do so, he was once more subjected to the same\ntorture, until his agony was so excessive that he exclaimed, “Fye on\nyou, why do you not strike your whingers into me, or blow me up with a\nbarrel of powder, rather than torture me thus unmercifully?” upon which\nthe Earl commanded Alexander Richard, one of his attendants, to stop the\npatient's mouth with a napkin, which was done accordingly. Thus he was\nonce more compelled to submit to their tyranny. The petition concluded\nwith stating, that the Earl, under pretence of the deeds thus\niniquitously obtained, had taken possession of the whole place and\nliving of Crossraguel, and enjoyed the profits thereof for three years.\n\nThe doom of the Regent and Council shows singularly the total\ninterruption of justice at this calamitous period, even in the most\nclamant cases of oppression. The Council declined interference with\nthe course of the ordinary justice of the county, (which was completely\nunder the said Earl of Cassilis' control,) and only enacted, that he\nshould forbear molestation of the unfortunate Comendator, under the\nsurety of two thousand pounds Scots. The Earl was appointed also to keep\nthe peace towards the celebrated George Buchanan, who had a pension out\nof the same Abbacy, to a similar extent, and under the like penalty.\n\nThe consequences are thus described by the Journalist already quoted.--\n\n“The said Laird of Bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could\nneither help the oppressed, nor yet the afflicted, applied his mind\nto the next remedy, and in the end, by his servants, took the house\nof Denure, where the poor Abbot was kept prisoner. The bruit flew fra\nCarrick to Galloway, and so suddenly assembled herd and hyre-man that\npertained to the band of the Kennedies; and so within a few hours was\nthe house of Denure environed again. The master of Cassilis was the\nfrackast [i.e. the readiest or boldest] and would not stay, but in his\nheat would lay fire to the dungeon, with no small boasting that all\nenemies within the house should die.\n\n“He was required and admonished by those that were within to be more\nmoderate, and not to hazard himself so foolishly. But no admonition\nwould help, till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder,\nand then ceased he from further pursuit in fury. The Laird of Bargany\nhad before purchest [obtained] of the authorities, letters, charging\nall faithfull subjects to the King's Majesty, to assist him against that\ncruel tyrant and mansworn traitor, the Earl of Cassilis; which\nletters, with his private writings, he published, and shortly found\nsic concurrence of Kyle and Cunynghame with his other friends, that the\nCarrick company drew back fra the house: and so the other approached,\nfurnished the house with more men, delivered the said Mr Allan, and\ncarried him to Ayr, where, publicly at the market cross of the said\ntown, he declared how cruelly he was entreated, and how the murdered\nKing suffered not sic torment as he did, excepting only he escaped the\ndeath: and, therefore, publickly did revoke all things that were done\nin that extremity, and especially revoked the subscription of the three\nwritings, to wit, of a fyve yeir tack and nineteen year tack, and of a\ncharter of feu. And so the house remained, and remains (till this day,\nthe 7th of February, 1571,) in the custody of the said Laird of Bargany\nand of his servants. And so cruelty was disappointed of proffeit\npresent, and shall be eternallie punished, unless he earnestly repent.\nAnd this far for the cruelty committed, to give occasion unto others,\nand to such as hate the monstrous dealing of degenerate nobility, to\nlook more diligently upon their behaviuours, and to paint them forth\nunto the world, that they themselves may be ashamed of their own\nbeastliness, and that the world may be advertised and admonished to\nabhor, detest, and avoid the company of all sic tyrants, who are not\nworthy of the society of men, but ought to be sent suddenly to the\ndevil, with whom they must burn without end, for their contempt of\nGod, and cruelty committed against his creatures. Let Cassilis and his\nbrother be the first to be the example unto others. Amen. Amen.” [62]\n\nThis extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography, to\nrender it more intelligible to the general reader. I have to add, that\nthe Kennedies of Bargany, who interfered in behalf of the oppressed\nAbbot, were themselves a younger branch of the Cassilis family, but\nheld different politics, and were powerful enough in this, and other\ninstances, to bid them defiance.\n\nThe ultimate issue of this affair does not appear; but as the house of\nCassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus and\nleases which belonged to Crossraguel Abbey, it is probable the talons\nof the King of Carrick were strong enough, in those disorderly times, to\nretain the prey which they had so mercilessly fixed upon.\n\nI may also add, that it appears by some papers in my possession, that\nthe officers or Country Keepers on the border, were accustomed to\ntorment their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their\nchimneys, to extort confession.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXIX\n\nNote F.--Heraldry\n\nThe author has been here upbraided with false heraldry, as having\ncharged metal upon metal. It should be remembered, however, that\nheraldry had only its first rude origin during the crusades, and that\nall the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time, and\nintroduced at a much later period. Those who think otherwise must\nsuppose that the Goddess of “Armoirers”, like the Goddess of Arms,\nsprung into the world completely equipped in all the gaudy trappings of\nthe department she presides over.\n\nAdditional Note\n\nIn corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which\nwere assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after the conquest of\nJerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses\nor, upon a field azure, displaying thus metal upon metal. The heralds\nhave tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modes--but Ferne\ngallantly contends, that a prince of Godfrey's qualities should not be\nbound by the ordinary rules. The Scottish Nisbet, and the same Ferne,\ninsist that the chiefs of the Crusade must have assigned to Godfrey this\nextraordinary and unwonted coat-of-arms, in order to induce those who\nshould behold them to make enquiries; and hence give them the name of\n“arma inquirenda”. But with reverence to these grave authorities, it\nseems unlikely that the assembled princes of Europe should have adjudged\nto Godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general rule, if such\nrule had then existed; at any rate, it proves that metal upon metal, now\naccounted a solecism in heraldry, was admitted in other cases similar to\nthat in the text. See Ferne's “Blazon of Gentrie” p. 238. Edition 1586.\nNisbet's “Heraldry”, vol. i. p. 113. Second Edition.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXXI\n\nNote G.--Ulrica's Death song.\n\nIt will readily occur to the antiquary, that these verses are intended\nto imitate the antique poetry of the Scalds--the minstrels of the old\nScandinavians--the race, as the Laureate so happily terms them,\n\n     “Stern to inflict, and stubborn to endure,\n     Who smiled in death.”\n\nThe poetry of the Anglo-Saxons, after their civilisation and conversion,\nwas of a different and softer character; but in the circumstances\nof Ulrica, she may be not unnaturally supposed to return to the wild\nstrains which animated her forefathers during the time of Paganism and\nuntamed ferocity.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXXII\n\nNote H.--Richard Coeur-de-Lion.\n\nThe interchange of a cuff with the jolly priest is not entirely out\nof character with Richard I., if romances read him aright. In the very\ncurious romance on the subject of his adventures in the Holy Land, and\nhis return from thence, it is recorded how he exchanged a pugilistic\nfavour of this nature, while a prisoner in Germany. His opponent was\nthe son of his principal warder, and was so imprudent as to give the\nchallenge to this barter of buffets. The King stood forth like a true\nman, and received a blow which staggered him. In requital, having\npreviously waxed his hand, a practice unknown, I believe, to the\ngentlemen of the modern fancy, he returned the box on the ear with\nsuch interest as to kill his antagonist on the spot.--See, in Ellis's\nSpecimens of English Romance, that of Coeur-de-Lion.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXXIII\n\nNote I.--Hedge-Priests.\n\nIt is curious to observe, that in every state of society, some sort of\nghostly consolation is provided for the members of the community, though\nassembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion. A gang of\nbeggars have their Patrico, and the banditti of the Apennines have among\nthem persons acting as monks and priests, by whom they are confessed,\nand who perform mass before them. Unquestionably, such reverend persons,\nin such a society, must accommodate their manners and their morals to\nthe community in which they live; and if they can occasionally obtain\na degree of reverence for their supposed spiritual gifts, are, on most\noccasions, loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as possessing a character\ninconsistent with all around them.\n\nHence the fighting parson in the old play of Sir John Oldcastle, and the\nfamous friar of Robin Hood's band. Nor were such characters ideal. There\nexists a monition of the Bishop of Durham against irregular churchmen\nof this class, who associated themselves with Border robbers, and\ndesecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function, by celebrating\nthem for the benefit of thieves, robbers, and murderers, amongst ruins\nand in caverns of the earth, without regard to canonical form, and with\ntorn and dirty attire, and maimed rites, altogether improper for the\noccasion.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XLI.\n\nNote J.--Castle of Coningsburgh.\n\nWhen I last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days, one of the very\nfew remaining examples of Saxon fortification, I was strongly impressed\nwith the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject, which,\nfrom some recent acquaintance with the architecture of the ancient\nScandinavians, seemed to me peculiarly interesting. I was, however,\nobliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey, without leisure to\ntake more than a transient view of Coningsburgh. Yet the idea dwells so\nstrongly in my mind, that I feel considerably tempted to write a page or\ntwo in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis, leaving better\nantiquaries to correct or refute conclusions which are perhaps too\nhastily drawn.\n\nThose who have visited the Zetland Islands, are familiar with the\ndescription of castles called by the inhabitants Burghs; and by the\nHighlanders--for they are also to be found both in the Western Isles\nand on the mainland--Duns. Pennant has engraved a view of the famous\nDun-Dornadilla in Glenelg; and there are many others, all of them built\nafter a peculiar mode of architecture, which argues a people in the most\nprimitive state of society. The most perfect specimen is that upon the\nisland of Mousa, near to the mainland of Zetland, which is probably in\nthe same state as when inhabited.\n\nIt is a single round tower, the wall curving in slightly, and then\nturning outward again in the form of a dice-box, so that the defenders\non the top might the better protect the base. It is formed of rough\nstones, selected with care, and laid in courses or circles, with much\ncompactness, but without cement of any kind. The tower has never, to\nappearance, had roofing of any sort; a fire was made in the centre of\nthe space which it encloses, and originally the building was probably\nlittle more than a wall drawn as a sort of screen around the great\ncouncil fire of the tribe. But, although the means or ingenuity of the\nbuilders did not extend so far as to provide a roof, they supplied the\nwant by constructing apartments in the interior of the walls of the\ntower itself. The circumvallation formed a double enclosure, the inner\nside of which was, in fact, two feet or three feet distant from the\nother, and connected by a concentric range of long flat stones, thus\nforming a series of concentric rings or stories of various heights,\nrising to the top of the tower. Each of these stories or galleries has\nfour windows, facing directly to the points of the compass, and rising\nof course regularly above each other. These four perpendicular ranges\nof windows admitted air, and, the fire being kindled, heat, or smoke at\nleast, to each of the galleries. The access from gallery to gallery is\nequally primitive. A path, on the principle of an inclined plane, turns\nround and round the building like a screw, and gives access to the\ndifferent stories, intersecting each of them in its turn, and thus\ngradually rising to the top of the wall of the tower. On the outside\nthere are no windows; and I may add, that an enclosure of a square, or\nsometimes a round form, gave the inhabitants of the Burgh an opportunity\nto secure any sheep or cattle which they might possess.\n\nSuch is the general architecture of that very early period when the\nNorthmen swept the seas, and brought to their rude houses, such as I\nhave described them, the plunder of polished nations. In Zetland there\nare several scores of these Burghs, occupying in every case, capes,\nheadlands, islets, and similar places of advantage singularly well\nchosen. I remember the remains of one upon an island in a small lake\nnear Lerwick, which at high tide communicates with the sea, the access\nto which is very ingenious, by means of a causeway or dike, about three\nor four inches under the surface of the water. This causeway makes a\nsharp angle in its approach to the Burgh. The inhabitants, doubtless,\nwere well acquainted with this, but strangers, who might approach in a\nhostile manner, and were ignorant of the curve of the causeway, would\nprobably plunge into the lake, which is six or seven feet in depth at\nthe least. This must have been the device of some Vauban or Cohorn of\nthose early times.\n\nThe style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed\nneither the art of using lime or cement of any kind, nor the skill to\nthrow an arch, construct a roof, or erect a stair; and yet, with all\nthis ignorance, showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation of\nBurghs, and regulating the access to them, as well as neatness and\nregularity in the erection, since the buildings themselves show a style\nof advance in the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so many\nof the principal branches of architectural knowledge.\n\nI have always thought, that one of the most curious and valuable objects\nof antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society, by the efforts\nmade in early ages to improve the rudeness of their first expedients,\nuntil they either approach excellence, or, as is more frequently the\ncase, are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries, which supersede\nboth the earlier and ruder system, and the improvements which have been\ningrafted upon it. For example, if we conceive the recent discovery of\ngas to be so much improved and adapted to domestic use, as to supersede\nall other modes of producing domestic light; we can already suppose,\nsome centuries afterwards, the heads of a whole Society of Antiquaries\nhalf turned by the discovery of a pair of patent snuffers, and by the\nlearned theories which would be brought forward to account for the form\nand purpose of so singular an implement.\n\nFollowing some such principle, I am inclined to regard the singular\nCastle of Coningsburgh--I mean the Saxon part of it--as a step in\nadvance from the rude architecture, if it deserves the name, which must\nhave been common to the Saxons as to other Northmen. The builders had\nattained the art of using cement, and of roofing a building,--great\nimprovements on the original Burgh. But in the round keep, a shape\nonly seen in the most ancient castles--the chambers excavated in the\nthickness of the walls and buttresses--the difficulty by which access is\ngained from one story to those above it, Coningsburgh still retains the\nsimplicity of its origin, and shows by what slow degrees man proceeded\nfrom occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings, as were afforded\nby the galleries of the Castle of Mousa, to the more splendid\naccommodations of the Norman castles, with all their stern and Gothic\ngraces.\n\nI am ignorant if these remarks are new, or if they will be confirmed\nby closer examination; but I think, that, on a hasty observation,\nConingsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to\ntrace the history of architecture back to the times preceding the Norman\nConquest.\n\nIt would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the\nCastle of Mousa, as it cannot be well understood by a plan.\n\nThe Castle of Coningsburgh is thus described:--\n\n“The castle is large, the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent from\nthe river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the town stands,\nsituated at the head of a rich and magnificent vale, formed by an\namphitheatre of woody hills, in which flows the gentle Don. Near the\ncastle is a barrow, said to be Hengist's tomb. The entrance is flanked\nto the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, and there are several\nsimilar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and on the\neast side the ditch and bank are double and very steep. On the top of\nthe churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high relief, two\nravens, or such-like birds. On the south side of the churchyard lies\nan ancient stone, ridged like a coffin, on which is carved a man on\nhorseback; and another man with a shield encountering a vast winged\nserpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was probably one\nof the rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this county. See it\nengraved on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate 14. fig. 1. The\nname of Coningsburgh, by which this castle goes in the old editions of\nthe Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the residence of the Saxon\nkings. It afterwards belonged to King Harold. The Conqueror bestowed it\non William de Warren, with all its privileges and jurisdiction, which\nare said to have extended over twenty-eight towns. At the corner of the\narea, which is of an irregular form, stands the great tower, or keep,\nplaced on a small hill of its own dimensions, on which lies six vast\nprojecting buttresses, ascending in a steep direction to prop and\nsupport the building, and continued upwards up the side as turrets. The\ntower within forms a complete circle, twenty-one feet in diameter, the\nwalls fourteen feet thick. The ascent into the tower is by an exceeding\ndeep flight of steep steps, four feet and a half wide, on the south side\nleading to a low doorway, over which is a circular arch crossed by a\ngreat transom stone. Within this door is the staircase which ascends\nstraight through the thickness of the wall, not communicating with the\nroom on the first floor, in whose centre is the opening to the dungeon.\nNeither of these lower rooms is lighted except from a hole in the floor\nof the third story; the room in which, as well as in that above it, is\nfinished with compact smooth stonework, both having chimney-pieces,\nwith an arch resting on triple clustered pillars. In the third story,\nor guard-chamber, is a small recess with a loop-hole, probably a\nbedchamber, and in that floor above a niche for a saint or holy-water\npot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon castle of the first ages of the\nHeptarchy. Mr. Watson thus describes it. From the first floor to the\nsecond story, (third from the ground,) is a way by a stair in the wall\nfive feet wide. The next staircase is approached by a ladder, and ends\nat the fourth story from the ground. Two yards from the door, at the\nhead of this stair, is an opening nearly east, accessible by treading\non the ledge of the wall, which diminishes eight inches each story; and\nthis last opening leads into a room or chapel ten feet by twelve, and\nfifteen or sixteen high, arched with free-stone, and supported by small\ncircular columns of the same, the capitals and arches Saxon. It has\nan east window, and on each side in the wall, about four feet from the\nground, a stone basin with a hole and iron pipe to convey the water into\nor through the wall. This chapel is one of the buttresses, but no sign\nof it without, for even the window, though large within, is only a long\nnarrow loop-hole, scarcely to be seen without. On the left side of this\nchapel is a small oratory, eight by six in the thickness of the wall,\nwith a niche in the wall, and enlightened by a like loop-hole. The\nfourth stair from the ground, ten feet west from the chapel door, leads\nto the top of the tower through the thickness of the wall, which at top\nis but three yards. Each story is about fifteen feet high, so that the\ntower will be seventy-five feet from the ground. The inside forms a\ncircle, whose diameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom\nof the dungeon is piled with stones.”--Gough's “Edition Of Camden's\nBritannia”. Second Edition, vol. iii. p. 267.\n\n\n************ FOOTNOTES ******************\n\n]\n\n[Footnote 1: The motto alludes to the Author returning to the stage repeatedly\nafter having taken leave.]\n\n[Footnote 2: This very curious poem, long a desideratum in Scottish literature,\nand given up as irrecoverably lost, was lately brought to light by\nthe researches of Dr Irvine of the Advocates' Library, and has been\nreprinted by Mr David Laing, Edinburgh.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Vol. ii. p. 167.]\n\n[Footnote 4: Like the Hermit, the Shepherd makes havock amongst the King's game;\nbut by means of a sling, not of a bow; like the Hermit, too, he has\nhis peculiar phrases of compotation, the sign and countersign being\nPasselodion and Berafriend. One can scarce conceive what humour our\nancestors found in this species of gibberish; but “I warrant it proved\nan excuse for the glass.”]\n\n[Footnote 5: The author had revised this posthumous work of Mr Strutt. See\nGeneral Preface to the present edition, Vol I. p. 65.]\n\n[Footnote 6: This anticipation proved but too true, as my learned correspondent\ndid not receive my letter until a twelvemonth after it was written. I\nmention this circumstance, that a gentleman attached to the cause of\nlearning, who now holds the principal control of the post-office, may\nconsider whether by some mitigation of the present enormous rates,\nsome favour might not be shown to the correspondents of the principal\nLiterary and Antiquarian Societies. I understand, indeed, that this\nexperiment was once tried, but that the mail-coach having broke down\nunder the weight of packages addressed to members of the Society of\nAntiquaries, it was relinquished as a hazardous experiment. Surely,\nhowever it would be possible to build these vehicles in a form more\nsubstantial, stronger in the perch, and broader in the wheels, so as\nto support the weight of Antiquarian learning; when, if they should be\nfound to travel more slowly, they would be not the less agreeable to\nquiet travellers like myself.--L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 7: Mr Skene of Rubislaw is here intimated, to whose taste and skill\nthe author is indebted for a series of etchings, exhibiting the various\nlocalities alluded to in these novels.]\n\n[Footnote 8: Note A. The Ranger of the Forest, that cuts the fore-claws off our\ndogs.]\n\n[Footnote 9: Note B. Negro Slaves.]\n\n[Footnote 11: The original has “Cnichts”, by which the Saxons seem to have\ndesignated a class of military attendants, sometimes free, sometimes\nbondsmen, but always ranking above an ordinary domestic, whether in the\nroyal household or in those of the aldermen and thanes. But the term\ncnicht, now spelt knight, having been received into the English language\nas equivalent to the Norman word chevalier, I have avoided using it in\nits more ancient sense, to prevent confusion. L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 12: Pillage.]\n\n[Footnote 13: These were drinks used by the Saxons, as we are informed by Mr\nTurner: Morat was made of honey flavoured with the juice of mulberries;\nPigment was a sweet and rich liquor, composed of wine highly spiced, and\nsweetened also with honey; the other liquors need no explanation. L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 14: There was no language which the Normans more formally separated\nfrom that of common life than the terms of the chase. The objects of\ntheir pursuit, whether bird or animal, changed their name each year, and\nthere were a hundred conventional terms, to be ignorant of which was to\nbe without one of the distinguishing marks of a gentleman. The reader\nmay consult Dame Juliana Berners' book on the subject. The origin of\nthis science was imputed to the celebrated Sir Tristrem, famous for his\ntragic intrigue with the beautiful Ysolte. As the Normans reserved the\namusement of hunting strictly to themselves, the terms of this formal\njargon were all taken from the French language.]\n\n[Footnote 15: In those days the Jews were subjected to an Exchequer, specially\ndedicated to that purpose, and which laid them under the most exorbitant\nimpositions.--L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 16: This sort of masquerade is supposed to have occasioned the\nintroduction of supporters into the science of heraldry.]\n\n[Footnote 17: These lines are part of an unpublished poem, by Coleridge, whose\nMuse so often tantalizes with fragments which indicate her powers, while\nthe manner in which she flings them from her betrays her caprice,\nyet whose unfinished sketches display more talent than the laboured\nmasterpieces of others.]\n\n[Footnote 18: This term of chivalry, transferred to the law, gives the phrase of\nbeing attainted of treason.]\n\n[Footnote 19: Presumption, insolence.]\n\n[Footnote 20: “Beau-seant” was the name of the Templars' banner, which was half\nblack, half white, to intimate, it is said, that they were candid and\nfair towards Christians, but black and terrible towards infidels.]\n\n[Footnote 21: There was nothing accounted so ignominious among the Saxons as to\nmerit this disgraceful epithet. Even William the Conqueror, hated as he\nwas by them, continued to draw a considerable army of Anglo-Saxons to\nhis standard, by threatening to stigmatize those who staid at home, as\nnidering. Bartholinus, I think, mentions a similar phrase which had like\ninfluence on the Danes. L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 22: The Jolly Hermit.--All readers, however slightly acquainted with\nblack letter, must recognise in the Clerk of Copmanhurst, Friar Tuck,\nthe buxom Confessor of Robin Hood's gang, the Curtal Friar of Fountain's\nAbbey.]\n\n[Footnote 23: Note C. Minstrelsy.]\n\n[Footnote 24: It may be proper to remind the reader, that the chorus of “derry\ndown” is supposed to be as ancient, not only as the times of the\nHeptarchy, but as those of the Druids, and to have furnished the chorus\nto the hymns of those venerable persons when they went to the wood to\ngather mistletoe.]\n\n[Footnote 25: A rere-supper was a night-meal, and sometimes signified a\ncollation, which was given at a late hour, after the regular supper had\nmade its appearance.

Battle of Stamford.]\n\n[Footnote 27: “Nota Bene.”--We by no means warrant the accuracy of this piece of\nnatural history, which we give on the authority of the Wardour MS. L.

The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal]\n\n[Footnote 29: Henry's Hist. edit. 1805, vol. vii. p..146.]\n\n[Footnote 30: I wish the Prior had also informed them when Niobe was sainted.\nProbably during that enlightened period when “Pan to Moses lent his\npagan horn.” L. T.]\n\n[Footnote 31: “Surquedy” and “outrecuidance”--insolence and presumption]\n\n[Footnote 32: Mantelets were temporary and movable defences formed of planks,\nunder cover of which the assailants advanced to the attack of fortified\nplaces of old. Pavisses were a species of large shields covering the\nwhole person, employed on the same occasions.]\n\n\n[Footnote 33: The bolt was the arrow peculiarly fitted to the cross-bow, as that\nof the long-bow was called a shaft. Hence the English proverb--“I will\neither make a shaft or bolt of it,” signifying a determination to make\none use or other of the thing spoken of.]\n\n[Footnote 34: The arblast was a cross-bow, the windlace the machine used in\nbending that weapon, and the quarrell, so called from its square or\ndiamond-shaped head, was the bolt adapted to it.]\n\n[Footnote 35: Note F. Heraldry]\n\n[Footnote 36: Every Gothic castle and city had, beyond the outer-walls, a\nfortification composed of palisades, called the barriers, which were\noften the scene of severe skirmishes, as these must necessarily be\ncarried before the walls themselves could be approached. Many of those\nvaliant feats of arms which adorn the chivalrous pages of Froissart took\nplace at the barriers of besieged places.]\n\n[Footnote 37: “Derring-do”--desperate courage.]\n\n[Footnote 38: The author has some idea that this passage is imitated from the\nappearance of Philidaspes, before the divine Mandane, when the city of\nBabylon is on fire, and he proposes to carry her from the flames. But\nthe theft, if there be one, would be rather too severely punished by the\npenance of searching for the original passage through the interminable\nvolumes of the Grand Cyrus.]\n\n[Footnote 39: Note G. Ulrica's Death Song]\n\n[Footnote 40: Thrall and bondsman.]\n\n[Footnote 41: A lawful freeman.]\n\n[Footnote 42: The notes upon the bugle were anciently called mots, and\nare distinguished in the old treatises on hunting, not by musical\ncharacters, but by written words.]\n\n[Footnote 421: Note H. Richard Coeur-de-Lion.]\n\n[Footnote 43: A commissary is said to have received similar consolation from a\ncertain Commander-in-chief, to whom he complained that a general officer\nhad used some such threat towards him as that in the text.]\n\n[Footnote 44: Borghs, or borrows, signifies pledges. Hence our word to borrow,\nbecause we pledge ourselves to restore what is lent.]\n\n[Footnote 45: “Dortour”, or dormitory.]\n\n[Footnote 46: Note I. Hedge-Priests.]\n\n[Footnote 47: Reginald Fitzurse, William de Tracy, Hugh de Morville, and\nRichard Brito, were the gentlemen of Henry the Second's household, who,\ninstigated by some passionate expressions of their sovereign, slew the\ncelebrated Thomas-a-Becket.]\n\n[Footnote 48: The establishments of the Knight Templars were called Preceptories,\nand the title of those who presided in the Order was Preceptor; as the\nprincipal Knights of Saint John were termed Commanders, and their\nhouses Commanderies. But these terms were sometimes, it would seem, used\nindiscriminately.]\n\n[Footnote 49: In the ordinances of the Knights of the Temple, this phrase is\nrepeated in a variety of forms, and occurs in almost every chapter, as\nif it were the signal-word of the Order; which may account for its being\nso frequently put in the Grand Master's mouth.]\n\n[Footnote 50: See the 13th chapter of Leviticus.]\n\n[Footnote 51: The edict which he quotes, is against communion with women of light\ncharacter.]\n\n[Footnote 53: The reader is again referred to the Rules of the Poor Military\nBrotherhood of the Temple, which occur in the Works of St Bernard.
