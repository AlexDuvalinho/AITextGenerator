Montgomery\n\n\n     “Life was a rose-lipped comrade\n      With purple flowers dripping from her fingers.”\n                                         --The Author.\n\n\n               TO\n               THE MEMORY OF\n               Aunt Mary Lawson\n               WHO TOLD ME MANY OF THE TALES\n               REPEATED BY THE\n               STORY GIRL\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD\n\n\nOnce upon a time we all walked on the golden road. It was a fair\nhighway, through the Land of Lost Delight; shadow and sunshine were\nblessedly mingled, and every turn and dip revealed a fresh charm and a\nnew loveliness to eager hearts and unspoiled eyes.\n\nOn that road we heard the song of morning stars; we drank in fragrances\naerial and sweet as a May mist; we were rich in gossamer fancies and\niris hopes; our hearts sought and found the boon of dreams; the years\nwaited beyond and they were very fair; life was a rose-lipped comrade\nwith purple flowers dripping from her fingers.\n\nWe may long have left the golden road behind, but its memories are the\ndearest of our eternal possessions; and those who cherish them as such\nmay haply find a pleasure in the pages of this book, whose people are\npilgrims on the golden road of youth.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOLDEN ROAD\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. A NEW DEPARTURE\n\n\n“I’ve thought of something amusing for the winter,” I said as we\ndrew into a half-circle around the glorious wood-fire in Uncle Alec’s\nkitchen.\n\nIt had been a day of wild November wind, closing down into a wet, eerie\ntwilight. Outside, the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the\neaves, and the rain was playing on the roof. The old willow at the gate\nwas writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music,\nborn of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night. But\nlittle we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world;\nwe kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our\nyoung lips.\n\nWe had been having a splendid game of Blind-Man’s Buff. That is, it\nhad been splendid at first; but later the fun went out of it because we\nfound that Peter was, of malice prepense, allowing himself to be\ncaught too easily, in order that he might have the pleasure of catching\nFelicity--which he never failed to do, no matter how tightly his eyes\nwere bound. What remarkable goose said that love is blind? Love can see\nthrough five folds of closely-woven muffler with ease!\n\n“I’m getting tired,” said Cecily, whose breath was coming rather quickly\nand whose pale cheeks had bloomed into scarlet. “Let’s sit down and get\nthe Story Girl to tell us a story.”\n\nBut as we dropped into our places the Story Girl shot a significant\nglance at me which intimated that this was the psychological moment for\nintroducing the scheme she and I had been secretly developing for some\ndays. It was really the Story Girl’s idea and none of mine. But she had\ninsisted that I should make the suggestion as coming wholly from myself.\n\n“If you don’t, Felicity won’t agree to it. You know yourself, Bev, how\ncontrary she’s been lately over anything I mention. And if she goes\nagainst it Peter will too--the ninny!--and it wouldn’t be any fun if we\nweren’t all in it.”\n\n“What is it?” asked Felicity, drawing her chair slightly away from\nPeter’s.\n\n“It is this. Let us get up a newspaper of our own--write it all\nourselves, and have all we do in it. Don’t you think we can get a lot of\nfun out of it?”\n\nEveryone looked rather blank and amazed, except the Story Girl. She knew\nwhat she had to do, and she did it.\n\n“What a silly idea!” she exclaimed, with a contemptuous toss of her long\nbrown curls. “Just as if WE could get up a newspaper!”\n\nFelicity fired up, exactly as we had hoped.\n\n“I think it’s a splendid idea,” she said enthusiastically. “I’d like to\nknow why we couldn’t get up as good a newspaper as they have in town!\nUncle Roger says the Daily Enterprise has gone to the dogs--all the news\nit prints is that some old woman has put a shawl on her head and gone\nacross the road to have tea with another old woman. I guess we could do\nbetter than that. You needn’t think, Sara Stanley, that nobody but you\ncan do anything.”\n\n“I think it would be great fun,” said Peter decidedly. “My Aunt Jane\nhelped edit a paper when she was at Queen’s Academy, and she said it was\nvery amusing and helped her a great deal.”\n\nThe Story Girl could hide her delight only by dropping her eyes and\nfrowning.\n\n“Bev wants to be editor,” she said, “and I don’t see how he can, with no\nexperience. Anyhow, it would be a lot of trouble.”\n\n“Some people are so afraid of a little bother,” retorted Felicity.\n\n“I think it would be nice,” said Cecily timidly, “and none of us have\nany experience of being editors, any more than Bev, so that wouldn’t\nmatter.”\n\n“Will it be printed?” asked Dan.\n\n“Oh, no,” I said. “We can’t have it printed. We’ll just have to write it\nout--we can buy foolscap from the teacher.”\n\n“I don’t think it will be much of a newspaper if it isn’t printed,” said\nDan scornfully.\n\n“It doesn’t matter very much what YOU think,” said Felicity.\n\n“Thank you,” retorted Dan.\n\n“Of course,” said the Story Girl hastily, not wishing to have Dan turned\nagainst our project, “if all the rest of you want it I’ll go in for it\ntoo. I daresay it would be real good fun, now that I come to think of\nit. And we’ll keep the copies, and when we become famous they’ll be\nquite valuable.”\n\n“I wonder if any of us ever will be famous,” said Felix.\n\n“The Story Girl will be,” I said.\n\n“I don’t see how she can be,” said Felicity skeptically. “Why, she’s\njust one of us.”\n\n“Well, it’s decided, then, that we’re to have a newspaper,” I resumed\nbriskly. “The next thing is to choose a name for it. That’s a very\nimportant thing.”\n\n“How often are you going to publish it?” asked Felix.\n\n“Once a month.”\n\n“I thought newspapers came out every day, or every week at least,” said\nDan.\n\n“We couldn’t have one every week,” I explained. “It would be too much\nwork.”\n\n“Well, that’s an argument,” admitted Dan. “The less work you can get\nalong with the better, in my opinion. No, Felicity, you needn’t say it.\nI know exactly what you want to say, so save your breath to cool your\nporridge. I agree with you that I never work if I can find anything else\nto do.”\n\n\n    “‘Remember it is harder still\n      To have no work to do,”’\n\n\nquoted Cecily reprovingly.\n\n“I don’t believe THAT,” rejoined Dan. “I’m like the Irishman who said he\nwished the man who begun work had stayed and finished it.”\n\n“Well, is it decided that Bev is to be editor?” asked Felix.\n\n“Of course it is,” Felicity answered for everybody.\n\n“Then,” said Felix, “I move that the name be The King Monthly Magazine.”\n\n“That sounds fine,” said Peter, hitching his chair a little nearer\nFelicity’s.\n\n“But,” said Cecily timidly, “that will leave out Peter and the Story\nGirl and Sara Ray, just as if they didn’t have a share in it. I don’t\nthink that would be fair.”\n\n“You name it then, Cecily,” I suggested.\n\n“Oh!” Cecily threw a deprecating glance at the Story Girl and Felicity.\nThen, meeting the contempt in the latter’s gaze, she raised her head\nwith unusual spirit.\n\n“I think it would be nice just to call it Our Magazine,” she said. “Then\nwe’d all feel as if we had a share in it.”\n\n“Our Magazine it will be, then,” I said. “And as for having a share in\nit, you bet we’ll all have a share in it. If I’m to be editor you’ll all\nhave to be sub-editors, and have charge of a department.”\n\n“Oh, I couldn’t,” protested Cecily.\n\n“You must,” I said inexorably. “‘England expects everyone to do his\nduty.’ That’s our motto--only we’ll put Prince Edward Island in place of\nEngland. There must be no shirking. Now, what departments will we have?\nWe must make it as much like a real newspaper as we can.”\n\n“Well, we ought to have an etiquette department, then,” said Felicity.\n“The Family Guide has one.”\n\n“Of course we’ll have one,” I said, “and Dan will edit it.”\n\n“Dan!” exclaimed Felicity, who had fondly expected to be asked to edit\nit herself.\n\n“I can run an etiquette column as well as that idiot in the Family\nGuide, anyhow,” said Dan defiantly. “But you can’t have an etiquette\ndepartment unless questions are asked. What am I to do if nobody asks\nany?”\n\n“You must make some up,” said the Story Girl. “Uncle Roger says that is\nwhat the Family Guide man does. He says it is impossible that there can\nbe as many hopeless fools in the world as that column would stand for\notherwise.”\n\n“We want you to edit the household department, Felicity,” I said, seeing\na cloud lowering on that fair lady’s brow. “Nobody can do that as well\nas you. Felix will edit the jokes and the Information Bureau, and Cecily\nmust be fashion editor. Yes, you must, Sis. It’s easy as wink. And the\nStory Girl will attend to the personals. They’re very important. Anyone\ncan contribute a personal, but the Story Girl is to see there are some\nin every issue, even if she has to make them up, like Dan with the\netiquette.”\n\n“Bev will run the scrap book department, besides the editorials,” said\nthe Story Girl, seeing that I was too modest to say it myself.\n\n“Aren’t you going to have a story page?” asked Peter.\n\n“We will, if you’ll be fiction and poetry editor,” I said.\n\nPeter, in his secret soul, was dismayed, but he would not blanch before\nFelicity.\n\n“All right,” he said, recklessly.\n\n“We can put anything we like in the scrap book department,” I explained,\n“but all the other contributions must be original, and all must have the\nname of the writer signed to them, except the personals. We must all do\nour best. Our Magazine is to be ‘a feast of reason and flow of soul.”’\n\nI felt that I had worked in two quotations with striking effect. The\nothers, with the exception of the Story Girl, looked suitably impressed.\n\n“But,” said Cecily, reproachfully, “haven’t you anything for Sara Ray to\ndo? She’ll feel awful bad if she is left out.”\n\nI had forgotten Sara Ray. Nobody, except Cecily, ever did remember\nSara Ray unless she was on the spot. But we decided to put her in as\nadvertising manager. That sounded well and really meant very little.\n\n“Well, we’ll go ahead then,” I said, with a sigh of relief that the\nproject had been so easily launched. “We’ll get the first issue out\nabout the first of January. And whatever else we do we mustn’t let Uncle\nRoger get hold of it. He’d make such fearful fun of it.”\n\n“I hope we can make a success of it,” said Peter moodily. He had been\nmoody ever since he was entrapped into being fiction editor.\n\n“It will be a success if we are determined to succeed,” I said. “‘Where\nthere is a will there is always a way.’”\n\n“That’s just what Ursula Townley said when her father locked her in her\nroom the night she was going to run away with Kenneth MacNair,” said the\nStory Girl.\n\nWe pricked up our ears, scenting a story.\n\n“Who were Ursula Townley and Kenneth MacNair?” I asked.\n\n“Kenneth MacNair was a first cousin of the Awkward Man’s grandfather,\nand Ursula Townley was the belle of the Island in her day. Who do you\nsuppose told me the story--no, read it to me, out of his brown book?”\n\n“Never the Awkward Man himself!” I exclaimed incredulously.\n\n“Yes, he did,” said the Story Girl triumphantly. “I met him one day\nlast week back in the maple woods when I was looking for ferns. He was\nsitting by the spring, writing in his brown book. He hid it when he saw\nme and looked real silly; but after I had talked to him awhile I just\nasked him about it, and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry\nin it, and if he did would he tell me, because I was dying to know. He\nsaid he wrote a little of everything in it; and then I begged him to\nread me something out of it, and he read me the story of Ursula and\nKenneth.”\n\n“I don’t see how you ever had the face,” said Felicity; and even Cecily\nlooked as if she thought the Story Girl had gone rather far.\n\n“Never mind that,” cried Felix, “but tell us the story. That’s the main\nthing.”\n\n“I’ll tell it just as the Awkward Man read it, as far as I can,” said\nthe Story Girl, “but I can’t put all his nice poetical touches in,\nbecause I can’t remember them all, though he read it over twice for me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A WILL, A WAY AND A WOMAN\n\n\n“One day, over a hundred years ago, Ursula Townley was waiting for\nKenneth MacNair in a great beechwood, where brown nuts were falling\nand an October wind was making the leaves dance on the ground like\npixy-people.”\n\n“What are pixy-people?” demanded Peter, forgetting the Story Girl’s\ndislike of interruptions.\n\n“Hush,” whispered Cecily. “That is only one of the Awkward Man’s\npoetical touches, I guess.”\n\n“There were cultivated fields between the grove and the dark blue gulf;\nbut far behind and on each side were woods, for Prince Edward Island a\nhundred years ago was not what it is today. The settlements were few and\nscattered, and the population so scanty that old Hugh Townley boasted\nthat he knew every man, woman and child in it.\n\n“Old Hugh was quite a noted man in his day. He was noted for\nseveral things--he was rich, he was hospitable, he was proud, he was\nmasterful--and he had for daughter the handsomest young woman in Prince\nEdward Island.\n\n“Of course, the young men were not blind to her good looks, and she had\nso many lovers that all the other girls hated her--”\n\n“You bet!” said Dan, aside--\n\n“But the only one who found favour in her eyes was the very last man she\nshould have pitched her fancy on, at least if old Hugh were the\njudge. Kenneth MacNair was a dark-eyed young sea-captain of the next\nsettlement, and it was to meet him that Ursula stole to the beechwood on\nthat autumn day of crisp wind and ripe sunshine. Old Hugh had forbidden\nhis house to the young man, making such a scene of fury about it that\neven Ursula’s high spirit quailed. Old Hugh had really nothing against\nKenneth himself; but years before either Kenneth or Ursula was born,\nKenneth’s father had beaten Hugh Townley in a hotly contested election.\nPolitical feeling ran high in those days, and old Hugh had never\nforgiven the MacNair his victory. The feud between the families dated\nfrom that tempest in the provincial teapot, and the surplus of votes\non the wrong side was the reason why, thirty years after, Ursula had to\nmeet her lover by stealth if she met him at all.”\n\n“Was the MacNair a Conservative or a Grit?” asked Felicity.\n\n“It doesn’t make any difference what he was,” said the Story Girl\nimpatiently. “Even a Tory would be romantic a hundred years ago. Well,\nUrsula couldn’t see Kenneth very often, for Kenneth lived fifteen miles\naway and was often absent from home in his vessel. On this particular\nday it was nearly three months since they had met.\n\n“The Sunday before, young Sandy MacNair had been in Carlyle church. He\nhad risen at dawn that morning, walked bare-footed for eight miles along\nthe shore, carrying his shoes, hired a harbour fisherman to row him over\nthe channel, and then walked eight miles more to the church at Carlyle,\nless, it is to be feared, from a zeal for holy things than that he might\ndo an errand for his adored brother, Kenneth. He carried a letter which\nhe contrived to pass into Ursula’s hand in the crowd as the people came\nout. This letter asked Ursula to meet Kenneth in the beechwood the\nnext afternoon, and so she stole away there when suspicious father and\nwatchful stepmother thought she was spinning in the granary loft.”\n\n“It was very wrong of her to deceive her parents,” said Felicity primly.\n\nThe Story Girl couldn’t deny this, so she evaded the ethical side of the\nquestion skilfully.\n\n“I am not telling you what Ursula Townley ought to have done,” she said\nloftily. “I am only telling you what she DID do. If you don’t want to\nhear it you needn’t listen, of course. There wouldn’t be many stories to\ntell if nobody ever did anything she shouldn’t do.\n\n“Well, when Kenneth came, the meeting was just what might have been\nexpected between two lovers who had taken their last kiss three months\nbefore. So it was a good half-hour before Ursula said,\n\n“‘Oh, Kenneth, I cannot stay long--I shall be missed. You said in your\nletter that you had something important to talk of. What is it?’\n\n“‘My news is this, Ursula. Next Saturday morning my vessel, The Fair\nLady, with her captain on board, sails at dawn from Charlottetown\nharbour, bound for Buenos Ayres. At this season this means a safe and\nsure return--next May.’\n\n“‘Kenneth!’ cried Ursula. She turned pale and burst into tears. ‘How can\nyou think of leaving me? Oh, you are cruel!’\n\n“‘Why, no, sweetheart,’ laughed Kenneth. ‘The captain of The Fair Lady\nwill take his bride with him. We’ll spend our honeymoon on the high\nseas, Ursula, and the cold Canadian winter under southern palms.’\n\n“‘You want me to run away with you, Kenneth?’ exclaimed Ursula.\n\n“‘Indeed, dear girl, there’s nothing else to do!’\n\n“‘Oh, I cannot!’ she protested. ‘My father would--’\n\n“‘We’ll not consult him--until afterward. Come, Ursula, you know there’s\nno other way. We’ve always known it must come to this. YOUR father will\nnever forgive me for MY father. You won’t fail me now. Think of the\nlong parting if you send me away alone on such a voyage. Pluck up your\ncourage, and we’ll let Townleys and MacNairs whistle their mouldy feuds\ndown the wind while we sail southward in The Fair Lady. I have a plan.’\n\n“‘Let me hear it,’ said Ursula, beginning to get back her breath.\n\n“‘There is to be a dance at The Springs Friday night. Are you invited,\nUrsula?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘Good. I am not--but I shall be there--in the fir grove behind the\nhouse, with two horses. When the dancing is at its height you’ll steal\nout to meet me. Then ‘tis but a fifteen mile ride to Charlottetown,\nwhere a good minister, who is a friend of mine, will be ready to marry\nus. By the time the dancers have tired their heels you and I will be on\nour vessel, able to snap our fingers at fate.’\n\n“‘And what if I do not meet you in the fir grove?’ said Ursula, a little\nimpertinently.\n\n“‘If you do not, I’ll sail for South America the next morning, and many\na long year will pass ere Kenneth MacNair comes home again.’\n\n“Perhaps Kenneth didn’t mean that, but Ursula thought he did, and it\ndecided her. She agreed to run away with him. Yes, of course that was\nwrong, too, Felicity. She ought to have said, ‘No, I shall be married\nrespectably from home, and have a wedding and a silk dress and\nbridesmaids and lots of presents.’ But she didn’t. She wasn’t as prudent\nas Felicity King would have been.”\n\n“She was a shameless hussy,” said Felicity, venting on the long-dead\nUrsula that anger she dare not visit on the Story Girl.\n\n“Oh, no, Felicity dear, she was just a lass of spirit. I’d have done the\nsame. And when Friday night came she began to dress for the dance with\na brave heart. She was to go to The Springs with her uncle and aunt,\nwho were coming on horseback that afternoon, and would then go on to The\nSprings in old Hugh’s carriage, which was the only one in Carlyle then.\nThey were to leave in time to reach The Springs before nightfall, for\nthe October nights were dark and the wooded roads rough for travelling.\n\n“When Ursula was ready she looked at herself in the glass with a good\ndeal of satisfaction. Yes, Felicity, she was a vain baggage, that same\nUrsula, but that kind didn’t all die out a hundred years ago. And she\nhad good reason for being vain. She wore the sea-green silk which had\nbeen brought out from England a year before and worn but once--at the\nChristmas ball at Government House. A fine, stiff, rustling silk it was,\nand over it shone Ursula’s crimson cheeks and gleaming eyes, and masses\nof nut brown hair.\n\n“As she turned from the glass she heard her father’s voice below, loud\nand angry. Growing very pale, she ran out into the hall. Her father was\nalready half way upstairs, his face red with fury. In the hall below\nUrsula saw her step-mother, looking troubled and vexed. At the door\nstood Malcolm Ramsay, a homely neighbour youth who had been courting\nUrsula in his clumsy way ever since she grew up. Ursula had always hated\nhim.\n\n“‘Ursula!’ shouted old Hugh, ‘come here and tell this scoundrel he lies.\nHe says that you met Kenneth MacNair in the beechgrove last Tuesday.\nTell him he lies! Tell him he lies!’\n\n“Ursula was no coward. She looked scornfully at poor Ramsay.\n\n“‘The creature is a spy and a tale-bearer,’ she said, ‘but in this he\ndoes not lie. I DID meet Kenneth MacNair last Tuesday.’\n\n“‘And you dare to tell me this to my face!’ roared old Hugh. ‘Back to\nyour room, girl! Back to your room and stay there! Take off that finery.\nYou go to no more dances. You shall stay in that room until I choose to\nlet you out. No, not a word! I’ll put you there if you don’t go. In with\nyou--ay, and take your knitting with you. Occupy yourself with that this\nevening instead of kicking your heels at The Springs!’\n\n“He snatched a roll of gray stocking from the hall table and flung\nit into Ursula’s room. Ursula knew she would have to follow it, or be\npicked up and carried in like a naughty child. So she gave the miserable\nRamsay a look that made him cringe, and swept into her room with her\nhead in the air. The next moment she heard the door locked behind\nher. Her first proceeding was to have a cry of anger and shame and\ndisappointment. That did no good, and then she took to marching up and\ndown her room. It did not calm her to hear the rumble of the carriage\nout of the gate as her uncle and aunt departed.\n\n“‘Oh, what’s to be done?’ she sobbed. ‘Kenneth will be furious. He will\nthink I have failed him and he will go away hot with anger against me.\nIf I could only send a word of explanation I know he would not leave me.\nBut there seems to be no way at all--though I have heard that there’s\nalways a way when there’s a will. Oh, I shall go mad! If the window\nwere not so high I would jump out of it. But to break my legs or my neck\nwould not mend the matter.’\n\n“The afternoon passed on. At sunset Ursula heard hoof-beats and ran to\nthe window. Andrew Kinnear of The Springs was tying his horse at the\ndoor. He was a dashing young fellow, and a political crony of old Hugh.\nNo doubt he would be at the dance that night. Oh, if she could get\nspeech for but a moment with him!\n\n“When he had gone into the house, Ursula, turning impatiently from the\nwindow, tripped and almost fell over the big ball of homespun yarn\nher father had flung on the floor. For a moment she gazed at it\nresentfully--then, with a gay little laugh, she pounced on it. The next\nmoment she was at her table, writing a brief note to Kenneth MacNair.\nWhen it was written, Ursula unwound the gray ball to a considerable\ndepth, pinned the note on it, and rewound the yarn over it. A gray\nball, the color of the twilight, might escape observation, where a white\nmissive fluttering down from an upper window would surely be seen by\nsomeone. Then she softly opened her window and waited.\n\n“It was dusk when Andrew went away. Fortunately old Hugh did not come to\nthe door with him. As Andrew untied his horse Ursula threw the ball with\nsuch good aim that it struck him, as she had meant it to do, squarely on\nthe head. Andrew looked up at her window. She leaned out, put her finger\nwarningly on her lips, pointed to the ball, and nodded. Andrew, looking\nsomewhat puzzled, picked up the ball, sprang to his saddle, and galloped\noff.\n\n“So far, well, thought Ursula. But would Andrew understand? Would he\nhave wit enough to think of exploring the big, knobby ball for its\ndelicate secret? And would he be at the dance after all?\n\n“The evening dragged by. Time had never seemed so long to Ursula. She\ncould not rest or sleep. It was midnight before she heard the patter of\na handful of gravel on her window-panes. In a trice she was leaning out.\nBelow in the darkness stood Kenneth MacNair.\n\n“‘Oh, Kenneth, did you get my letter? And is it safe for you to be\nhere?’\n\n“‘Safe enough. Your father is in bed. I’ve waited two hours down the\nroad for his light to go out, and an extra half-hour to put him to\nsleep. The horses are there. Slip down and out, Ursula. We’ll make\nCharlottetown by dawn yet.’\n\n“‘That’s easier said than done, lad. I’m locked in. But do you go out\nbehind the new barn and bring the ladder you will find there.’\n\n“Five minutes later, Miss Ursula, hooded and cloaked, scrambled\nsoundlessly down the ladder, and in five more minutes she and Kenneth\nwere riding along the road.\n\n“‘There’s a stiff gallop before us, Ursula,’ said Kenneth.\n\n“‘I would ride to the world’s end with you, Kenneth MacNair,’ said\nUrsula. Oh, of course she shouldn’t have said anything of the sort,\nFelicity. But you see people had no etiquette departments in those days.\nAnd when the red sunlight of a fair October dawn was shining over the\ngray sea The Fair Lady sailed out of Charlottetown harbour. On her deck\nstood Kenneth and Ursula MacNair, and in her hand, as a most precious\ntreasure, the bride carried a ball of gray homespun yarn.”\n\n“Well,” said Dan, yawning, “I like that kind of a story. Nobody goes and\ndies in it, that’s one good thing.”\n\n“Did old Hugh forgive Ursula?” I asked.\n\n“The story stopped there in the brown book,” said the Story Girl, “but\nthe Awkward Man says he did, after awhile.”\n\n“It must be rather romantic to be run away with,” remarked Cecily,\nwistfully.\n\n“Don’t you get such silly notions in your head, Cecily King,” said\nFelicity, severely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE CHRISTMAS HARP\n\n\nGreat was the excitement in the houses of King as Christmas drew nigh.\nThe air was simply charged with secrets. Everybody was very penurious\nfor weeks beforehand and hoards were counted scrutinizingly every day.\nMysterious pieces of handiwork were smuggled in and out of sight, and\nwhispered consultations were held, about which nobody thought of being\njealous, as might have happened at any other time. Felicity was in her\nelement, for she and her mother were deep in preparations for the\nday. Cecily and the Story Girl were excluded from these doings\nwith indifference on Aunt Janet’s part and what seemed ostentatious\ncomplacency on Felicity’s. Cecily took this to heart and complained to\nme about it.\n\n“I’m one of this family just as much as Felicity is,” she said, with as\nmuch indignation as Cecily could feel, “and I don’t think she need\nshut me out of everything. When I wanted to stone the raisins for the\nmince-meat she said, no, she would do it herself, because Christmas\nmince-meat was very particular--as if I couldn’t stone raisins right!\nThe airs Felicity puts on about her cooking just make me sick,”\n concluded Cecily wrathfully.\n\n“It’s a pity she doesn’t make a mistake in cooking once in a while\nherself,” I said. “Then maybe she wouldn’t think she knew so much more\nthan other people.”\n\nAll parcels that came in the mail from distant friends were taken charge\nof by Aunts Janet and Olivia, not to be opened until the great day of\nthe feast itself. How slowly the last week passed! But even watched pots\nwill boil in the fulness of time, and finally Christmas day came, gray\nand dour and frost-bitten without, but full of revelry and rose-red\nmirth within. Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl came over\nearly for the day; and Peter came too, with his shining, morning face,\nto be hailed with joy, for we had been afraid that Peter would not be\nable to spend Christmas with us. His mother had wanted him home with\nher.\n\n“Of course I ought to go,” Peter had told me mournfully, “but we won’t\nhave turkey for dinner, because ma can’t afford it. And ma always cries\non holidays because she says they make her think of father. Of course\nshe can’t help it, but it ain’t cheerful. Aunt Jane wouldn’t have cried.\nAunt Jane used to say she never saw the man who was worth spoiling her\neyes for. But I guess I’ll have to spend Christmas at home.”\n\nAt the last moment, however, a cousin of Mrs. Craig’s in Charlottetown\ninvited her for Christmas, and Peter, being given his choice of going or\nstaying, joyfully elected to stay. So we were all together, except Sara\nRay, who had been invited but whose mother wouldn’t let her come.\n\n“Sara Ray’s mother is a nuisance,” snapped the Story Girl. “She just\nlives to make that poor child miserable, and she won’t let her go to the\nparty tonight, either.”\n\n“It is just breaking Sara’s heart that she can’t,” said Cecily\ncompassionately. “I’m almost afraid I won’t enjoy myself for thinking of\nher, home there alone, most likely reading the Bible, while we’re at the\nparty.”\n\n“She might be worse occupied than reading the Bible,” said Felicity\nrebukingly.\n\n“But Mrs. Ray makes her read it as a punishment,” protested Cecily.\n“Whenever Sara cries to go anywhere--and of course she’ll cry\ntonight--Mrs. Ray makes her read seven chapters in the Bible. I wouldn’t\nthink that would make her very fond of it. And I’ll not be able to talk\nthe party over with Sara afterwards--and that’s half the fun gone.”\n\n“You can tell her all about it,” comforted Felix.\n\n“Telling isn’t a bit like talking it over,” retorted Cecily. “It’s too\none-sided.”\n\nWe had an exciting time opening our presents. Some of us had more than\nothers, but we all received enough to make us feel comfortably that we\nwere not unduly neglected in the matter. The contents of the box which\nthe Story Girl’s father had sent her from Paris made our eyes stick out.\nIt was full of beautiful things, among them another red silk dress--not\nthe bright, flame-hued tint of her old one, but a rich, dark crimson,\nwith the most distracting flounces and bows and ruffles; and with it\nwere little red satin slippers with gold buckles, and heels that made\nAunt Janet hold up her hands in horror. Felicity remarked scornfully\nthat she would have thought the Story Girl would get tired wearing red\nso much, and even Cecily commented apart to me that she thought when\nyou got so many things all at once you didn’t appreciate them as much as\nwhen you only got a few.\n\n“I’d never get tired of red,” said the Story Girl. “I just love it--it’s\nso rich and glowing. When I’m dressed in red I always feel ever so much\ncleverer than in any other colour. Thoughts just crowd into my brain\none after the other. Oh, you darling dress--you dear, sheeny, red-rosy,\nglistening, silky thing!”\n\nShe flung it over her shoulder and danced around the kitchen.\n\n“Don’t be silly, Sara,” said Aunt Janet, a little stimy. She was a good\nsoul, that Aunt Janet, and had a kind, loving heart in her ample bosom.\nBut I fancy there were times when she thought it rather hard that the\ndaughter of a roving adventurer--as she considered him--like Blair\nStanley should disport herself in silk dresses, while her own daughters\nmust go clad in gingham and muslin--for those were the days when a\nfeminine creature got one silk dress in her lifetime, and seldom more\nthan one.\n\nThe Story Girl also got a present from the Awkward Man--a little,\nshabby, worn volume with a great many marks on the leaves.\n\n“Why, it isn’t new--it’s an old book!” exclaimed Felicity. “I didn’t\nthink the Awkward Man was mean, whatever else he was.”\n\n“Oh, you don’t understand, Felicity,” said the Story Girl patiently.\n“And I don’t suppose I can make you understand. But I’ll try. I’d ten\ntimes rather have this than a new book. It’s one of his own, don’t you\nsee--one that he has read a hundred times and loved and made a friend\nof. A new book, just out of a shop, wouldn’t be the same thing at all.\nIt wouldn’t MEAN anything. I consider it a great compliment that he has\ngiven me this book. I’m prouder of it than of anything else I’ve got.”\n\n“Well, you’re welcome to it,” said Felicity. “I don’t understand and I\ndon’t want to. I wouldn’t give anybody a Christmas present that wasn’t\nnew, and I wouldn’t thank anybody who gave me one.”\n\nPeter was in the seventh heaven because Felicity had given him a\npresent--and, moreover, one that she had made herself. It was a bookmark\nof perforated cardboard, with a gorgeous red and yellow worsted goblet\nworked on it, and below, in green letters, the solemn warning, “Touch\nNot The Cup.” As Peter was not addicted to habits of intemperance, not\neven to looking on dandelion wine when it was pale yellow, we did not\nexactly see why Felicity should have selected such a device. But Peter\nwas perfectly satisfied, so nobody cast any blight on his happiness by\ncarping criticism. Later on Felicity told me she had worked the bookmark\nfor him because his father used to drink before he ran away.\n\n“I thought Peter ought to be warned in time,” she said.\n\nEven Pat had a ribbon of blue, which he clawed off and lost half an hour\nafter it was tied on him. Pat did not care for vain adornments of the\nbody.\n\nWe had a glorious Christmas dinner, fit for the halls of Lucullus, and\nate far more than was good for us, none daring to make us afraid on that\none day of the year. And in the evening--oh, rapture and delight!--we\nwent to Kitty Marr’s party.\n\nIt was a fine December evening; the sharp air of morning had mellowed\nuntil it was as mild as autumn. There had been no snow, and the long\nfields, sloping down from the homestead, were brown and mellow. A weird,\ndreamy stillness had fallen on the purple earth, the dark fir woods, the\nvalley rims, the sere meadows. Nature seemed to have folded satisfied\nhands to rest, knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her.\n\nAt first, when the invitations to the party had come, Aunt Janet had\nsaid we could not go; but Uncle Alec interceded in our favour, perhaps\ninfluenced thereto by Cecily’s wistful eyes. If Uncle Alec had a\nfavourite among his children it was Cecily, and he had grown even more\nindulgent towards her of late. Now and then I saw him looking at her\nintently, and, following his eyes and thought, I had, somehow, seen that\nCecily was paler and thinner than she had been in the summer, and that\nher soft eyes seemed larger, and that over her little face in moments of\nrepose there was a certain languor and weariness that made it very sweet\nand pathetic. And I heard him tell Aunt Janet that he did not like to\nsee the child getting so much the look of her Aunt Felicity.\n\n“Cecily is perfectly well,” said Aunt Janet sharply. “She’s only growing\nvery fast. Don’t be foolish, Alec.”\n\nBut after that Cecily had cups of cream where the rest of us got only\nmilk; and Aunt Janet was very particular to see that she had her rubbers\non whenever she went out.\n\nOn this merry Christmas evening, however, no fears or dim foreshadowings\nof any coming event clouded our hearts or faces. Cecily looked brighter\nand prettier than I had ever seen her, with her softly shining eyes and\nthe nut brown gloss of her hair. Felicity was too beautiful for words;\nand even the Story Girl, between excitement and the crimson silk array,\nblossomed out with a charm and allurement more potent than any regular\nloveliness--and this in spite of the fact that Aunt Olivia had tabooed\nthe red satin slippers and mercilessly decreed that stout shoes should\nbe worn.\n\n“I know just how you feel about it, you daughter of Eve,” she said, with\ngay sympathy, “but December roads are damp, and if you are going to\nwalk to Marrs’ you are not going to do it in those frivolous Parisian\nconcoctions, even with overboots on; so be brave, dear heart, and show\nthat you have a soul above little red satin shoes.”\n\n“Anyhow,” said Uncle Roger, “that red silk dress will break the hearts\nof all the feminine small fry at the party. You’d break their spirits,\ntoo, if you wore the slippers. Don’t do it, Sara. Leave them one wee\nloophole of enjoyment.”\n\n“What does Uncle Roger mean?” whispered Felicity.\n\n“He means you girls are all dying of jealousy because of the Story\nGirl’s dress,” said Dan.\n\n“I am not of a jealous disposition,” said Felicity loftily, “and she’s\nentirely welcome to the dress--with a complexion like that.”\n\nBut we enjoyed that party hugely, every one of us. And we enjoyed the\nwalk home afterwards, through dim, enshadowed fields where silvery\nstar-beams lay, while Orion trod his stately march above us, and a red\nmoon climbed up the black horizon’s rim. A brook went with us part of\nthe way, singing to us through the dark--a gay, irresponsible vagabond\nof valley and wilderness.\n\nFelicity and Peter walked not with us. Peter’s cup must surely have\nbrimmed over that Christmas night. When we left the Marr house, he had\nboldly said to Felicity, “May I see you home?” And Felicity, much to our\namazement, had taken his arm and marched off with him. The primness\nof her was indescribable, and was not at all ruffled by Dan’s hoot of\nderision. As for me, I was consumed by a secret and burning desire to\nask the Story Girl if I might see HER home; but I could not screw my\ncourage to the sticking point. How I envied Peter his easy, insouciant\nmanner! I could not emulate him, so Dan and Felix and Cecily and the\nStory Girl and I all walked hand in hand, huddling a little closer\ntogether as we went through James Frewen’s woods--for there are strange\nharps in a fir grove, and who shall say what fingers sweep them? Mighty\nand sonorous was the music above our heads as the winds of the night\nstirred the great boughs tossing athwart the starlit sky. Perhaps it was\nthat aeolian harmony which recalled to the Story Girl a legend of elder\ndays.\n\n“I read such a pretty story in one of Aunt Olivia’s books last night,”\n she said. “It was called ‘The Christmas Harp.’ Would you like to hear\nit? It seems to me it would just suit this part of the road.”\n\n“There isn’t anything about--about ghosts in it, is there?” said Cecily\ntimidly.\n\n“Oh, no, I wouldn’t tell a ghost story here for anything. I’d frighten\nmyself too much. This story is about one of the shepherds who saw the\nangels on the first Christmas night. He was just a youth, and he loved\nmusic with all his heart, and he longed to be able to express the melody\nthat was in his soul. But he could not; he had a harp and he often tried\nto play on it; but his clumsy fingers only made such discord that\nhis companions laughed at him and mocked him, and called him a madman\nbecause he would not give it up, but would rather sit apart by himself,\nwith his arms about his harp, looking up into the sky, while they\ngathered around their fire and told tales to wile away their long night\nvigils as they watched their sheep on the hills. But to him the thoughts\nthat came out of the great silence were far sweeter than their mirth;\nand he never gave up the hope, which sometimes left his lips as a\nprayer, that some day he might be able to express those thoughts in\nmusic to the tired, weary, forgetful world. On the first Christmas night\nhe was out with his fellow shepherds on the hills. It was chill and\ndark, and all, except him, were glad to gather around the fire. He sat,\nas usual, by himself, with his harp on his knee and a great longing in\nhis heart. And there came a marvellous light in the sky and over the\nhills, as if the darkness of the night had suddenly blossomed into a\nwonderful meadow of flowery flame; and all the shepherds saw the angels\nand heard them sing. And as they sang, the harp that the young shepherd\nheld began to play softly by itself, and as he listened to it he\nrealized that it was playing the same music that the angels sang\nand that all his secret longings and aspirations and strivings were\nexpressed in it. From that night, whenever he took the harp in his\nhands, it played the same music; and he wandered all over the world\ncarrying it; wherever the sound of its music was heard hate and discord\nfled away and peace and good-will reigned. No one who heard it could\nthink an evil thought; no one could feel hopeless or despairing or\nbitter or angry. When a man had once heard that music it entered into\nhis soul and heart and life and became a part of him for ever. Years\nwent by; the shepherd grew old and bent and feeble; but still he\nroamed over land and sea, that his harp might carry the message of the\nChristmas night and the angel song to all mankind. At last his strength\nfailed him and he fell by the wayside in the darkness; but his harp\nplayed as his spirit passed; and it seemed to him that a Shining One\nstood by him, with wonderful starry eyes, and said to him, ‘Lo, the\nmusic thy harp has played for so many years has been but the echo of the\nlove and sympathy and purity and beauty in thine own soul; and if at any\ntime in the wanderings thou hadst opened the door of that soul to evil\nor envy or selfishness thy harp would have ceased to play. Now thy life\nis ended; but what thou hast given to mankind has no end; and as long as\nthe world lasts, so long will the heavenly music of the Christmas harp\nring in the ears of men.’ When the sun rose the old shepherd lay dead by\nthe roadside, with a smile on his face; and in his hands was a harp with\nall its strings broken.”\n\nWe left the fir woods as the tale was ended, and on the opposite hill\nwas home. A dim light in the kitchen window betokened that Aunt Janet\nhad no idea of going to bed until all her young fry were safely housed\nfor the night.\n\n“Ma’s waiting up for us,” said Dan. “I’d laugh if she happened to go to\nthe door just as Felicity and Peter were strutting up. I guess she’ll be\ncross. It’s nearly twelve.”\n\n“Christmas will soon be over,” said Cecily, with a sigh. “Hasn’t it\nbeen a nice one? It’s the first we’ve all spent together. Do you suppose\nwe’ll ever spend another together?”\n\n“Lots of ‘em,” said Dan cheerily. “Why not?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Cecily, her footsteps lagging somewhat.\n“Only things seem just a little too pleasant to last.”\n\n“If Willy Fraser had had as much spunk as Peter, Miss Cecily King\nmightn’t be so low spirited,” quoth Dan, significantly.\n\nCecily tossed her head and disdained reply. There are really some\nremarks a self-respecting young lady must ignore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS\n\n\nIf we did not have a white Christmas we had a white New Year. Midway\nbetween the two came a heavy snowfall. It was winter in our orchard of\nold delights then,--so truly winter that it was hard to believe summer\nhad ever dwelt in it, or that spring would ever return to it. There were\nno birds to sing the music of the moon; and the path where the apple\nblossoms had fallen were heaped with less fragrant drifts. But it was a\nplace of wonder on a moonlight night, when the snowy arcades shone\nlike avenues of ivory and crystal, and the bare trees cast fairy-like\ntraceries upon them. Over Uncle Stephen’s Walk, where the snow had\nfallen smoothly, a spell of white magic had been woven. Taintless and\nwonderful it seemed, like a street of pearl in the new Jerusalem.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve we were all together in Uncle Alec’s kitchen, which\nwas tacitly given over to our revels during the winter evenings. The\nStory Girl and Peter were there, of course, and Sara Ray’s mother had\nallowed her to come up on condition that she should be home by eight\nsharp. Cecily was glad to see her, but the boys never hailed her arrival\nwith over-much delight, because, since the dark began to come down\nearly, Aunt Janet always made one of us walk down home with her. We\nhated this, because Sara Ray was always so maddeningly self-conscious\nof having an escort. We knew perfectly well that next day in school she\nwould tell her chums as a “dead” secret that “So-and-So King saw her\nhome” from the hill farm the night before. Now, seeing a young lady home\nfrom choice, and being sent home with her by your aunt or mother are two\nentirely different things, and we thought Sara Ray ought to have sense\nenough to know it.\n\nOutside there was a vivid rose of sunset behind the cold hills of fir,\nand the long reaches of snowy fields glowed fairily pink in the western\nlight. The drifts along the edges of the meadows and down the lane\nlooked as if a series of breaking waves had, by the lifting of a\nmagician’s wand, been suddenly transformed into marble, even to their\ntoppling curls of foam.\n\nSlowly the splendour died, giving place to the mystic beauty of a winter\ntwilight when the moon is rising. The hollow sky was a cup of blue. The\nstars came out over the white glens and the earth was covered with a\nkingly carpet for the feet of the young year to press.\n\n“I’m so glad the snow came,” said the Story Girl. “If it hadn’t the New\nYear would have seemed just as dingy and worn out as the old. There’s\nsomething very solemn about the idea of a New Year, isn’t there? Just\nthink of three hundred and sixty-five whole days, with not a thing\nhappened in them yet.”\n\n“I don’t suppose anything very wonderful will happen in them,” said\nFelix pessimistically. To Felix, just then, life was flat, stale and\nunprofitable because it was his turn to go home with Sara Ray.\n\n“It makes me a little frightened to think of all that may happen in\nthem,” said Cecily. “Miss Marwood says it is what we put into a year,\nnot what we get out of it, that counts at last.”\n\n“I’m always glad to see a New Year,” said the Story Girl. “I wish we\ncould do as they do in Norway. The whole family sits up until midnight,\nand then, just as the clock is striking twelve, the father opens the\ndoor and welcomes the New Year in. Isn’t it a pretty custom?”\n\n“If ma would let us stay up till twelve we might do that too,” said Dan,\n“but she never will. I call it mean.”\n\n“If I ever have children I’ll let them stay up to watch the New Year\nin,” said the Story Girl decidedly.\n\n“So will I,” said Peter, “but other nights they’ll have to go to bed at\nseven.”\n\n“You ought to be ashamed, speaking of such things,” said Felicity, with\na scandalized face.\n\nPeter shrank into the background abashed, no doubt believing that he had\nbroken some Family Guide precept all to pieces.\n\n“I didn’t know it wasn’t proper to mention children,” he muttered\napologetically.\n\n“We ought to make some New Year resolutions,” suggested the Story Girl.\n“New Year’s Eve is the time to make them.”\n\n“I can’t think of any resolutions I want to make,” said Felicity, who\nwas perfectly satisfied with herself.\n\n“I could suggest a few to you,” said Dan sarcastically.\n\n“There are so many I would like to make,” said Cecily, “that I’m afraid\nit wouldn’t be any use trying to keep them all.”\n\n“Well, let’s all make a few, just for the fun of it, and see if we can\nkeep them,” I said. “And let’s get paper and ink and write them out.\nThat will make them seem more solemn and binding.”\n\n“And then pin them up on our bedroom walls, where we’ll see them every\nday,” suggested the Story Girl, “and every time we break a resolution\nwe must put a cross opposite it. That will show us what progress we are\nmaking, as well as make us ashamed if we have too many crosses.”\n\n“And let’s have a Roll of Honour in Our Magazine,” suggested Felix, “and\nevery month we’ll publish the names of those who keep their resolutions\nperfect.”\n\n“I think it’s all nonsense,” said Felicity. But she joined our circle\naround the table, though she sat for a long time with a blank sheet\nbefore her.\n\n“Let’s each make a resolution in turn,” I said. “I’ll lead off.”\n\nAnd, recalling with shame certain unpleasant differences of opinion I\nhad lately had with Felicity, I wrote down in my best hand,\n\n“I shall try to keep my temper always.”\n\n“You’d better,” said Felicity tactfully.\n\nIt was Dan’s turn next.\n\n“I can’t think of anything to start with,” he said, gnawing his\npenholder fiercely.\n\n“You might make a resolution not to eat poison berries,” suggested\nFelicity.\n\n“You’d better make one not to nag people everlastingly,” retorted Dan.\n\n“Oh, don’t quarrel the last night of the old year,” implored Cecily.\n\n“You might resolve not to quarrel any time,” suggested Sara Ray.\n\n“No, sir,” said Dan emphatically. “There’s no use making a resolution\nyou CAN’T keep. There are people in this family you’ve just GOT to\nquarrel with if you want to live. But I’ve thought of one--I won’t do\nthings to spite people.”\n\nFelicity--who really was in an unbearable mood that night--laughed\ndisagreeably; but Cecily gave her a fierce nudge, which probably\nrestrained her from speaking.\n\n“I will not eat any apples,” wrote Felix.\n\n“What on earth do you want to give up eating apples for?” asked Peter in\nastonishment.\n\n“Never mind,” returned Felix.\n\n“Apples make people fat, you know,” said Felicity sweetly.\n\n“It seems a funny kind of resolution,” I said doubtfully. “I think our\nresolutions ought to be giving up wrong things or doing right ones.”\n\n“You make your resolutions to suit yourself and I’ll make mine to suit\nmyself,” said Felix defiantly.\n\n“I shall never get drunk,” wrote Peter painstakingly.\n\n“But you never do,” said the Story Girl in astonishment.\n\n“Well, it will be all the easier to keep the resolution,” argued Peter.\n\n“That isn’t fair,” complained Dan. “If we all resolved not to do the\nthings we never do we’d all be on the Roll of Honour.”\n\n“You let Peter alone,” said Felicity severely. “It’s a very good\nresolution and one everybody ought to make.”\n\n“I shall not be jealous,” wrote the Story Girl.\n\n“But are you?” I asked, surprised.\n\nThe Story Girl coloured and nodded. “Of one thing,” she confessed, “but\nI’m not going to tell what it is.”\n\n“I’m jealous sometimes, too,” confessed Sara Ray, “and so my first\nresolution will be ‘I shall try not to feel jealous when I hear the\nother girls in school describing all the sick spells they’ve had.’”\n\n“Goodness, do you want to be sick?” demanded Felix in astonishment.\n\n“It makes a person important,” explained Sara Ray.\n\n“I am going to try to improve my mind by reading good books and\nlistening to older people,” wrote Cecily.\n\n“You got that out of the Sunday School paper,” cried Felicity.\n\n“It doesn’t matter where I got it,” said Cecily with dignity. “The main\nthing is to keep it.”\n\n“It’s your turn, Felicity,” I said.\n\nFelicity tossed her beautiful golden head.\n\n“I told you I wasn’t going to make any resolutions. Go on yourself.”\n\n“I shall always study my grammar lesson,” I wrote--I, who loathed\ngrammar with a deadly loathing.\n\n“I hate grammar too,” sighed Sara Ray. “It seems so unimportant.”\n\nSara was rather fond of a big word, but did not always get hold of the\nright one. I rather suspected that in the above instance she really\nmeant uninteresting.\n\n“I won’t get mad at Felicity, if I can help it,” wrote Dan.\n\n“I’m sure I never do anything to make you mad,” exclaimed Felicity.\n\n“I don’t think it’s polite to make resolutions about your sisters,” said\nPeter.\n\n“He can’t keep it anyway,” scoffed Felicity. “He’s got such an awful\ntemper.”\n\n“It’s a family failing,” flashed Dan, breaking his resolution ere the\nink on it was dry.\n\n“There you go,” taunted Felicity.\n\n“I’ll work all my arithmetic problems without any help,” scribbled\nFelix.\n\n“I wish I could resolve that, too,” sighed Sara Ray, “but it wouldn’t be\nany use. I’d never be able to do those compound multiplication sums the\nteacher gives us to do at home every night if I didn’t get Judy Pineau\nto help me. Judy isn’t a good reader and she can’t spell AT ALL, but you\ncan’t stick her in arithmetic as far as she went herself. I feel sure,”\n concluded poor Sara, in a hopeless tone, “that I’ll NEVER be able to\nunderstand compound multiplication.”\n\n\n          “‘Multiplication is vexation,\n               Division is as bad,\n           The rule of three perplexes me,\n               And fractions drive me mad,’”\n\n\nquoted Dan.\n\n“I haven’t got as far as fractions yet,” sighed Sara, “and I hope I’ll\nbe too big to go to school before I do. I hate arithmetic, but I am\nPASSIONATELY fond of geography.”\n\n“I will not play tit-tat-x on the fly leaves of my hymn book in church,”\n wrote Peter.\n\n“Mercy, did you ever do such a thing?” exclaimed Felicity in horror.\n\nPeter nodded shamefacedly.\n\n“Yes--that Sunday Mr. Bailey preached. He was so long-winded, I got\nawful tired, and, anyway, he was talking about things I couldn’t\nunderstand, so I played tit-tat-x with one of the Markdale boys. It was\nthe day I was sitting up in the gallery.”\n\n“Well, I hope if you ever do the like again you won’t do it in OUR pew,”\n said Felicity severely.\n\n“I ain’t going to do it at all,” said Peter. “I felt sort of mean all\nthe rest of the day.”\n\n“I shall try not to be vexed when people interrupt me when I’m telling\nstories,” wrote the Story Girl. “but it will be hard,” she added with a\nsigh.\n\n“I never mind being interrupted,” said Felicity.\n\n“I shall try to be cheerful and smiling all the time,” wrote Cecily.\n\n“You are, anyway,” said Sara Ray loyally.\n\n“I don’t believe we ought to be cheerful ALL the time,” said the Story\nGirl. “The Bible says we ought to weep with those who weep.”\n\n“But maybe it means that we’re to weep cheerfully,” suggested Cecily.\n\n“Sorter as if you were thinking, ‘I’m very sorry for you but I’m mighty\nglad I’m not in the scrape too,’” said Dan.\n\n“Dan, don’t be irreverent,” rebuked Felicity.\n\n“I know a story about old Mr. and Mrs. Davidson of Markdale,” said\nthe Story Girl. “She was always smiling and it used to aggravate her\nhusband, so one day he said very crossly, ‘Old lady, what ARE you\ngrinning at?’ ‘Oh, well, Abiram, everything’s so bright and pleasant,\nI’ve just got to smile.’\n\n“Not long after there came a time when everything went wrong--the crop\nfailed and their best cow died, and Mrs. Davidson had rheumatism; and\nfinally Mr. Davidson fell and broke his leg. But still Mrs. Davidson\nsmiled. ‘What in the dickens are you grinning about now, old lady?’\nhe demanded. ‘Oh, well, Abiram,’ she said, ‘everything is so dark and\nunpleasant I’ve just got to smile.’ ‘Well,’ said the old man crossly, ‘I\nthink you might give your face a rest sometimes.’”\n\n“I shall not talk gossip,” wrote Sara Ray with a satisfied air.\n\n“Oh, don’t you think that’s a little TOO strict?” asked Cecily\nanxiously. “Of course, it’s not right to talk MEAN gossip, but the\nharmless kind doesn’t hurt. If I say to you that Emmy MacPhail is going\nto get a new fur collar this winter, THAT is harmless gossip, but if I\nsay I don’t see how Emmy MacPhail can afford a new fur collar when her\nfather can’t pay my father for the oats he got from him, that would be\nMEAN gossip. If I were you, Sara, I’d put MEAN gossip.”\n\nSara consented to this amendment.\n\n“I will be polite to everybody,” was my third resolution, which passed\nwithout comment.\n\n“I’ll try not to use slang since Cecily doesn’t like it,” wrote Dan.\n\n“I think some slang is real cute,” said Felicity.\n\n“The Family Guide says it’s very vulgar,” grinned Dan. “Doesn’t it, Sara\nStanley?”\n\n“Don’t disturb me,” said the Story Girl dreamily. “I’m just thinking a\nbeautiful thought.”\n\n“I’ve thought of a resolution to make,” cried Felicity. “Mr. Marwood\nsaid last Sunday we should always try to think beautiful thoughts and\nthen our lives would be very beautiful. So I shall resolve to think a\nbeautiful thought every morning before breakfast.”\n\n“Can you only manage one a day?” queried Dan.\n\n“And why before breakfast?” I asked.\n\n“Because it’s easier to think on an empty stomach,” said Peter, in all\ngood faith. But Felicity shot a furious glance at him.\n\n“I selected that time,” she explained with dignity, “because when I’m\nbrushing my hair before my glass in the morning I’ll see my resolution\nand remember it.”\n\n“Mr. Marwood meant that ALL our thoughts ought to be beautiful,” said\nthe Story Girl. “If they were, people wouldn’t be afraid to say what\nthey think.”\n\n“They oughtn’t to be afraid to, anyhow,” said Felix stoutly. “I’m going\nto make a resolution to say just what I think always.”\n\n“And do you expect to get through the year alive if you do?” asked Dan.\n\n“It might be easy enough to say what you think if you could always be\nsure just what you DO think,” said the Story Girl. “So often I can’t be\nsure.”\n\n“How would you like it if people always said just what they think to\nyou?” asked Felicity.\n\n“I’m not very particular what SOME people think of me,” rejoined Felix.\n\n“I notice you don’t like to be told by anybody that you’re fat,”\n retorted Felicity.\n\n“Oh, dear me, I do wish you wouldn’t all say such sarcastic things to\neach other,” said poor Cecily plaintively. “It sounds so horrid the last\nnight of the old year. Dear knows where we’ll all be this night next\nyear. Peter, it’s your turn.”\n\n“I will try,” wrote Peter, “to say my prayers every night regular, and\nnot twice one night because I don’t expect to have time the next,--like\nI did the night before the party,” he added.\n\n“I s’pose you never said your prayers until we got you to go to church,”\n said Felicity--who had had no hand in inducing Peter to go to church,\nbut had stoutly opposed it, as recorded in the first volume of our\nfamily history.\n\n“I did, too,” said Peter. “Aunt Jane taught me to say my prayers. Ma\nhadn’t time, being as father had run away; ma had to wash at night same\nas in day-time.”\n\n“I shall learn to cook,” wrote the Story Girl, frowning.\n\n“You’d better resolve not to make puddings of--” began Felicity, then\nstopped as suddenly as if she had bitten off the rest of her sentence\nand swallowed it. Cecily had nudged her, so she had probably remembered\nthe Story Girl’s threat that she would never tell another story if she\nwas ever twitted with the pudding she had made from sawdust. But we all\nknew what Felicity had started to say and the Story Girl dealt her a\nmost uncousinly glance.\n\n“I will not cry because mother won’t starch my aprons,” wrote Sara Ray.\n\n“Better resolve not to cry about anything,” said Dan kindly.\n\nSara Ray shook her head forlornly.\n\n“That would be too hard to keep. There are times when I HAVE to cry.\nIt’s a relief.”\n\n“Not to the folks who have to hear you,” muttered Dan aside to Cecily.\n\n“Oh, hush,” whispered Cecily back. “Don’t go and hurt her feelings the\nlast night of the old year. Is it my turn again? Well, I’ll resolve not\nto worry because my hair is not curly. But, oh, I’ll never be able to\nhelp wishing it was.”\n\n“Why don’t you curl it as you used to do, then?” asked Dan.\n\n“You know very well that I’ve never put my hair up in curl papers since\nthe time Peter was dying of the measles,” said Cecily reproachfully. “I\nresolved then I wouldn’t because I wasn’t sure it was quite right.”\n\n“I will keep my finger-nails neat and clean,” I wrote. “There, that’s\nfour resolutions. I’m not going to make any more. Four’s enough.”\n\n“I shall always think twice before I speak,” wrote Felix.\n\n“That’s an awful waste of time,” commented Dan, “but I guess you’ll need\nto if you’re always going to say what you think.”\n\n“I’m going to stop with three,” said Peter.\n\n“I will have all the good times I can,” wrote the Story Girl.\n\n“THAT’S what I call sensible,” said Dan.\n\n“It’s a very easy resolution to keep, anyhow,” commented Felix.\n\n“I shall try to like reading the Bible,” wrote Sara Ray.\n\n“You ought to like reading the Bible without trying to,” exclaimed\nFelicity.\n\n“If you had to read seven chapters of it every time you were naughty I\ndon’t believe you would like it either,” retorted Sara Ray with a flash\nof spirit.\n\n“I shall try to believe only half of what I hear,” was Cecily’s\nconcluding resolution.\n\n“But which half?” scoffed Dan.\n\n“The best half,” said sweet Cecily simply.\n\n“I’ll try to obey mother ALWAYS,” wrote Sara Ray, with a tremendous\nsigh, as if she fully realized the difficulty of keeping such a\nresolution. “And that’s all I’m going to make.”\n\n“Felicity has only made one,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“I think it better to make just one and keep it than make a lot and\nbreak them,” said Felicity loftily.\n\nShe had the last word on the subject, for it was time for Sara Ray to\ngo, and our circle broke up. Sara and Felix departed and we watched\nthem down the lane in the moonlight--Sara walking demurely in one runner\ntrack, and Felix stalking grimly along in the other. I fear the romantic\nbeauty of that silver shining night was entirely thrown away on my\nmischievous brother.\n\nAnd it was, as I remember it, a most exquisite night--a white poem, a\nfrosty, starry lyric of light. It was one of those nights on which one\nmight fall asleep and dream happy dreams of gardens of mirth and\nsong, feeling all the while through one’s sleep the soft splendour and\nradiance of the white moon-world outside, as one hears soft, far-away\nmusic sounding through the thoughts and words that are born of it.\n\nAs a matter of fact, however, Cecily dreamed that night that she saw\nthree full moons in the sky, and wakened up crying with the horror of\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE FIRST NUMBER OF “OUR MAGAZINE”\n\n\nThe first number of Our Magazine was ready on New Year’s Day, and we\nread it that evening in the kitchen. All our staff had worked nobly and\nwe were enormously proud of the result, although Dan still continued\nto scoff at a paper that wasn’t printed. The Story Girl and I read it\nturnabout while the others, except Felix, ate apples. It opened with a\nshort\n\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nWith this number Our Magazine makes its first bow to the public. All\nthe editors have done their best and the various departments are full of\nvaluable information and amusement. The tastefully designed cover is by\na famous artist, Mr. Blair Stanley, who sent it to us all the way from\nEurope at the request of his daughter. Mr. Peter Craig, our enterprising\nliterary editor, contributes a touching love story. (Peter, aside, in\na gratified pig’s whisper: “I never was called ‘Mr.’ before.”) Miss\nFelicity King’s essays on Shakespeare is none the worse for being an\nold school composition, as it is new to most of our readers. Miss\nCecily King contributes a thrilling article of adventure. The various\ndepartments are ably edited, and we feel that we have reason to be proud\nof Our Magazine. But we shall not rest on our oars. “Excelsior” shall\never be our motto. We trust that each succeeding issue will be better\nthan the one that went before. We are well aware of many defects, but\nit is easier to see them than to remedy them. Any suggestion that would\ntend to the improvement of Our Magazine will be thankfully received,\nbut we trust that no criticism will be made that will hurt anyone’s\nfeelings. Let us all work together in harmony, and strive to make Our\nMagazine an influence for good and a source of innocent pleasure, and\nlet us always remember the words of the poet.\n\n\n  “The heights by great men reached and kept\n     Were not attained by sudden flight,\n   But they, while their companions slept,\n     Were toiling upwards in the night.”\n\n\n(Peter, IMPRESSIVELY:--“I’ve read many a worse editorial in the\nEnterprise.”)\n\n\nESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE\n\nShakespeare’s full name was William Shakespeare. He did not always spell\nit the same way. He lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and wrote a\ngreat many plays. His plays are written in dialogue form. Some people\nthink they were not written by Shakespeare but by another man of the\nsame name. I have read some of them because our school teacher says\neverybody ought to read them, but I did not care much for them. There\nare some things in them I cannot understand. I like the stories of\nValeria H. Montague in the Family Guide ever so much better. They are\nmore exciting and truer to life. Romeo and Juliet was one of the plays I\nread. It was very sad. Juliet dies and I don’t like stories where people\ndie. I like it better when they all get married especially to dukes and\nearls. Shakespeare himself was married to Anne Hatheway. They are both\ndead now. They have been dead a good while. He was a very famous man.\n\n                                     FELICITY KING.\n\n\n(PETER, MODESTLY: “I don’t know much about Shakespeare myself but I’ve\ngot a book of his plays that belonged to my Aunt Jane, and I guess I’ll\nhave to tackle him as soon as I finish with the Bible.”)\n\n\nTHE STORY OF AN ELOPEMENT FROM CHURCH\n\nThis is a true story. It happened in Markdale to an uncle of my mothers.\nHe wanted to marry Miss Jemima Parr. Felicity says Jemima is not a\nromantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it in this case\nbecause it is a true story and her name realy was Jemima. My mothers\nuncle was named Thomas Taylor. He was poor at that time and so the\nfather of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him\nhe was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him. Miss\nJemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy\nabout her and she wanted him too. She cried almost every night after\nher father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to\nsleep or she would have died. And she was so frightened he might try to\ncome for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that\nwould never let go. But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that. He\nwaited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church in the\nmiddle of the week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr\nand her family all went because her father was an elder. My mothers\nuncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs\nfamily. When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr\ndidnt but set bolt uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and\nwispered in her ear. I dont know what he said so I cant right it but\nMiss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head. Perhaps\nsome people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered\nat prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs\nfather had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when\nhe was a respektable young man though not rich. Well when they were\nsinging the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very\nquitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too\nreal quick. Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round\ntalking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers\nuncle Thomas were eloping outside. And what do you suppose they eloped\nin. Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay. And when he went out they\nwere gone and his slay was gone also his horse. Of course my mothers\nuncle Thomas didnt steal the horse. He just borroed it and sent it home\nthe next day. But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig\nto follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they\ngot married. And they lived happy together forever afterwards. Mothers\nuncle Thomas lived to be a very old man. He died very suddent. He felt\nquite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead.\n\n                                       PETER CRAIG.\n\n\nMY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE\n\nThe editor says we must all write up our most exciting adventure for Our\nMagazine. My most exciting adventure happened a year ago last November.\nI was nearly frightened to death. Dan says he wouldn’t of been scared\nand Felicity says she would of known what it was but it’s easy to talk.\n\nIt happened the night I went down to see Kitty Marr. I thought when I\nwent that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her.\nBut she wasn’t there and I had to come home alone. Kitty came a piece\nof the way but she wouldn’t come any further than Uncle James Frewen’s\ngate. She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would\nget the tooth-ache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of\nthe dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James’ hollow. I did wish she\nhadn’t said anything about the dog because I mightn’t of thought about\nit if she hadn’t. I had to go on alone thinking of it. I’d heard the\nstory often but I’d never believed in it. They said the dog used to\nappear at one end of the bridge and walk across it with people and\nvanish when he got to the other end. He never tried to bite anyone but\none wouldn’t want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didn’t believe\nin him. I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a\nparaphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School\nlesson but oh, how my heart beat when I got near the hollow! It was so\ndark. You could just see things dim-like but you couldn’t see what they\nwere. When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to\nthe railing so I couldn’t think the dog was behind me. And then just in\nthe middle of the bridge I met something. It was right before me and\nit was big and black, just about the size of a Newfoundland dog, and\nI thought I could see a white nose. And it kept jumping about from one\nside of the bridge to the other. Oh, I hope none of my readers will ever\nbe so frightened as I was then. I was too frightened to run back because\nI was afraid it would chase me and I couldn’t get past it, it moved so\nquick, and then it just made one spring right on me and I felt its claws\nand I screamed and fell down. It rolled off to one side and laid there\nquite quiet but I didn’t dare move and I don’t know what would have\nbecome of me if Amos Cowan hadn’t come along that very minute with a\nlantern. And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that\nawful thing beside me. And what do you think it was but a big umbrella\nwith a white handle? Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away\nfrom him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it. I\nfelt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella\nopen when it wasent raining. But the Cowans do such queer things. You\nremember the time Jerry Cowan sold us God’s picture. Amos took me right\nhome and I was thankful for I don’t know what would have become of me\nif he hadn’t come along. I couldn’t sleep all night and I never want to\nhave any more adventures like that one.\n\n                                      CECILY KING.\n\n\nPERSONALS\n\nMr. Dan King felt somewhat indisposed the day after Christmas--probably\nas the result of too much mince pie. (DAN, INDIGNANTLY:--“I wasn’t. I\nonly et one piece!”)\n\nMr. Peter Craig thinks he saw the Family Ghost on Christmas Eve. But\nthe rest of us think all he saw was the white calf with the red tail.\n(PETER, MUTTERING SULKILY:--“It’s a queer calf that would walk up on end\nand wring its hands.”)\n\nMiss Cecily King spent the night of Dec. 20th with Miss Kitty Marr. They\ntalked most of the night about new knitted lace patterns and their beaus\nand were very sleepy in school next day. (CECILY, SHARPLY:--“We never\nmentioned such things!”)\n\nPatrick Grayfur, Esq., was indisposed yesterday, but seems to be\nenjoying his usual health to-day.\n\nThe King family expect their Aunt Eliza to visit them in January. She\nis really our great-aunt. We have never seen her but we are told she is\nvery deaf and does not like children. So Aunt Janet says we must make\nourselves scarece when she comes.\n\nMiss Cecily King has undertaken to fill with names a square of the\nmissionary quilt which the Mission Band is making. You pay five cents\nto have your name embroidered in a corner, ten cents to have it in\nthe centre, and a quarter if you want it left off altogether. (CECILY,\nINDIGNANTLY:--“That isn’t the way at all.”)\n\n\nADS.\n\nWANTED--A remedy to make a fat boy thin. Address, “Patient Sufferer,\ncare of Our Magazine.”\n\n(FELIX, SOURLY:--“Sara Ray never got that up. I’ll bet it was Dan. He’d\nbetter stick to his own department.”)\n\n\nHOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT\n\nMrs. Alexander King killed all her geese the twentieth of December. We\nall helped pick them. We had one Christmas Day and will have one every\nfortnight the rest of the winter.\n\nThe bread was sour last week because mother wouldn’t take my advice. I\ntold her it was too warm for it in the corner behind the stove.\n\nMiss Felicity King invented a new recete for date cookies recently,\nwhich everybody said were excelent. I am not going to publish it though,\nbecause I don’t want other people to find it out.\n\nANXIOUS INQUIRER:--If you want to remove inkstains place the stain\nover steam and apply salt and lemon juice. If it was Dan who sent this\nquestion in I’d advise him to stop wiping his pen on his shirt sleeves\nand then he wouldn’t have so many stains.\n\n                                     FELICITY KING.\n\n\nETIQUETTE DEPARTMENT\n\n\n\nF-l-x:--Yes, you should offer your arm to a lady when seeing her home,\nbut don’t keep her standing too long at the gate while you say good\nnight.\n\n(FELIX, ENRAGED:--“I never asked such a question.”)\n\nC-c-l-y:--No, it is not polite to use “Holy Moses” or “dodgasted” in\nordinary conversation.\n\n(Cecily had gone down cellar to replenish the apple plate, so this\npassed without protest.)\n\nS-r-a:--No, it isn’t polite to cry all the time. As to whether you\nshould ask a young man in, it all depends on whether he went home with\nyou of his own accord or was sent by some elderly relative.\n\nF-l-t-y:--It does not break any rule of etiquette if you keep a button\noff your best young man’s coat for a keepsake. But don’t take more than\none or his mother might miss them.\n\n                                          DAN KING.\n\n\nFASHION NOTES\n\nKnitted mufflers are much more stylish than crocheted ones this winter.\nIt is nice to have one the same colour as your cap.\n\nRed mittens with a black diamond pattern on the back are much run after.\nEm Frewen’s grandma knits hers for her. She can knit the double diamond\npattern and Em puts on such airs about it, but I think the single\ndiamond is in better taste.\n\nThe new winter hats at Markdale are very pretty. It is so exciting to\npick a hat. Boys can’t have that fun. Their hats are so much alike.\n\n                                       CECILY KING.\n\n\nFUNNY PARAGRAPHS\n\nThis is a true joke and really happened.\n\nThere was an old local preacher in New Brunswick one time whose name was\nSamuel Clask. He used to preach and pray and visit the sick just like a\nregular minister. One day he was visiting a neighbour who was dying and\nhe prayed the Lord to have mercy on him because he was very poor and\nhad worked so hard all his life that he hadn’t much time to attend to\nreligion.\n\n“And if you don’t believe me, O Lord,” Mr. Clask finished up with, “just\ntake a look at his hands.”\n\n                                        FELIX KING.\n\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION BUREAU\n\nDAN:--Do porpoises grow on trees or vines?\n\nAns. Neither. They inhabit the deep sea.\n\n                                        FELIX KING.\n\n\n(DAN, AGGRIEVED:--“Well, I’d never heard of porpoises and it sounded\nlike something that grew. But you needn’t have gone and put it in the\npaper.”\n\nFELIX:--“It isn’t any worse than the things you put in about me that I\nnever asked at all.”\n\nCECILY, SOOTHINGLY:--“Oh, well, boys, it’s all in fun, and I think Our\nMagazine is perfectly elegant.”\n\nFELICITY, FAILING TO SEE THE STORY GIRL AND BEVERLEY EXCHANGING WINKS\nBEHIND HER BACK:--“It certainly is, though SOME PEOPLE were so opposed\nto starting it.”)\n\n\nWhat harmless, happy fooling it all was! How we laughed as we read and\nlistened and devoured apples! Blow high, blow low, no wind can ever\nquench the ruddy glow of that faraway winter night in our memories. And\nthough Our Magazine never made much of a stir in the world, or was the\nmeans of hatching any genius, it continued to be capital fun for us\nthroughout the year.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. GREAT-AUNT ELIZA’S VISIT\n\n\nIt was a diamond winter day in February--clear, cold, hard, brilliant.\nThe sharp blue sky shone, the white fields and hills glittered, the\nfringe of icicles around the eaves of Uncle Alec’s house sparkled. Keen\nwas the frost and crisp the snow over our world; and we young fry of the\nKing households were all agog to enjoy life--for was it not Saturday,\nand were we not left all alone to keep house?\n\nAunt Janet and Aunt Olivia had had their last big “kill” of market\npoultry the day before; and early in the morning all our grown-ups set\nforth to Charlottetown, to be gone the whole day. They left us many\ncharges as usual, some of which we remembered and some of which we\nforgot; but with Felicity in command none of us dared stray far out of\nline. The Story Girl and Peter came over, of course, and we all agreed\nthat we would haste and get the work done in the forenoon, that we might\nhave an afternoon of uninterrupted enjoyment. A taffy-pull after dinner\nand then a jolly hour of coasting on the hill field before supper were\non our programme. But disappointment was our portion. We did manage to\nget the taffy made but before we could sample the result satisfactorily,\nand just as the girls were finishing with the washing of the dishes,\nFelicity glanced out of the window and exclaimed in tones of dismay,\n\n“Oh, dear me, here’s Great-aunt Eliza coming up the lane! Now, isn’t\nthat too mean?”\n\nWe all looked out to see a tall, gray-haired lady approaching the house,\nlooking about her with the slightly puzzled air of a stranger. We had\nbeen expecting Great-aunt Eliza’s advent for some weeks, for she was\nvisiting relatives in Markdale. We knew she was liable to pounce down on\nus any time, being one of those delightful folk who like to “surprise”\n people, but we had never thought of her coming that particular day. It\nmust be confessed that we did not look forward to her visit with any\npleasure. None of us had ever seen her, but we knew she was very deaf,\nand had very decided opinions as to the way in which children should\nbehave.\n\n“Whew!” whistled Dan. “We’re in for a jolly afternoon. She’s deaf as a\npost and we’ll have to split our throats to make her hear at all. I’ve a\nnotion to skin out.”\n\n“Oh, don’t talk like that, Dan,” said Cecily reproachfully. “She’s old\nand lonely and has had a great deal of trouble. She has buried three\nhusbands. We must be kind to her and do the best we can to make her\nvisit pleasant.”\n\n“She’s coming to the back door,” said Felicity, with an agitated glance\naround the kitchen. “I told you, Dan, that you should have shovelled the\nsnow away from the front door this morning. Cecily, set those pots\nin the pantry quick--hide those boots, Felix--shut the cupboard door,\nPeter--Sara, straighten up the lounge. She’s awfully particular and ma\nsays her house is always as neat as wax.”\n\nTo do Felicity justice, while she issued orders to the rest of us,\nshe was flying busily about herself, and it was amazing how much was\naccomplished in the way of putting the kitchen in perfect order during\nthe two minutes in which Great-aunt Eliza was crossing the yard.\n\n“Fortunately the sitting-room is tidy and there’s plenty in the pantry,”\n said Felicity, who could face anything undauntedly with a well-stocked\nlarder behind her.\n\nFurther conversation was cut short by a decided rap at the door.\nFelicity opened it.\n\n“Why, how do you do, Aunt Eliza?” she said loudly.\n\nA slightly bewildered look appeared on Aunt Eliza’s face. Felicity\nperceived she had not spoken loudly enough.\n\n“How do you do, Aunt Eliza,” she repeated at the top of her voice.\n“Come in--we are glad to see you. We’ve been looking for you for ever so\nlong.”\n\n“Are your father and mother at home?” asked Aunt Eliza, slowly.\n\n“No, they went to town today. But they’ll be home this evening.”\n\n“I’m sorry they’re away,” said Aunt Eliza, coming in, “because I can\nstay only a few hours.”\n\n“Oh, that’s too bad,” shouted poor Felicity, darting an angry glance at\nthe rest of us, as if to demand why we didn’t help her out. “Why, we’ve\nbeen thinking you’d stay a week with us anyway. You MUST stay over\nSunday.”\n\n“I really can’t. I have to go to Charlottetown tonight,” returned Aunt\nEliza.\n\n“Well, you’ll take off your things and stay to tea, at least,” urged\nFelicity, as hospitably as her strained vocal chords would admit.\n\n“Yes, I think I’ll do that. I want to get acquainted with my--my nephews\nand nieces,” said Aunt Eliza, with a rather pleasant glance around our\ngroup. If I could have associated the thought of such a thing with my\npreconception of Great-aunt Eliza I could have sworn there was a twinkle\nin her eye. But of course it was impossible. “Won’t you introduce\nyourselves, please?”\n\nFelicity shouted our names and Great-aunt Eliza shook hands all round.\nShe performed the duty grimly and I concluded I must have been mistaken\nabout the twinkle. She was certainly very tall and dignified and\nimposing--altogether a great-aunt to be respected.\n\nFelicity and Cecily took her to the spare room and then left her in the\nsitting-room while they returned to the kitchen, to discuss the matter\nin family conclave.\n\n“Well, and what do you think of dear Aunt Eliza?” asked Dan.\n\n“S-s-s-sh,” warned Cecily, with a glance at the half-open hall door.\n\n“Pshaw,” scoffed Dan, “she can’t hear us. There ought to be a law\nagainst anyone being as deaf as that.”\n\n“She’s not so old-looking as I expected,” said Felix. “If her hair\nwasn’t so white she wouldn’t look much older than your mother.”\n\n“You don’t have to be very old to be a great-aunt,” said Cecily. “Kitty\nMarr has a great-aunt who is just the same age as her mother. I expect\nit was burying so many husbands turned her hair white. But Aunt Eliza\ndoesn’t look just as I expected she would either.”\n\n“She’s dressed more stylishly than I expected,” said Felicity. “I\nthought she’d be real old-fashioned, but her clothes aren’t too bad at\nall.”\n\n“She wouldn’t be bad-looking if ‘tweren’t for her nose,” said Peter.\n“It’s too long, and crooked besides.”\n\n“You needn’t criticize our relations like that,” said Felicity tartly.\n\n“Well, aren’t you doing it yourselves?” expostulated Peter.\n\n“That’s different,” retorted Felicity. “Never you mind Great-aunt\nEliza’s nose.”\n\n“Well, don’t expect me to talk to her,” said Dan, “‘cause I won’t.”\n\n“I’m going to be very polite to her,” said Felicity. “She’s rich. But\nhow are we to entertain her, that’s the question.”\n\n“What does the Family Guide say about entertaining your rich, deaf old\naunt?” queried Dan ironically.\n\n“The Family Guide says we should be polite to EVERYBODY,” said Cecily,\nwith a reproachful look at Dan.\n\n“The worst of it is,” said Felicity, looking worried, “that there isn’t\na bit of old bread in the house and she can’t eat new, I’ve heard father\nsay. It gives her indigestion. What will we do?”\n\n“Make a pan of rusks and apologize for having no old bread,” suggested\nthe Story Girl, probably by way of teasing Felicity. The latter,\nhowever, took it in all good faith.\n\n“The Family Guide says we should never apologize for things we can’t\nhelp. It says it’s adding insult to injury to do it. But you run over\nhome for a loaf of stale bread, Sara, and it’s a good idea about the\nrusks. I’ll make a panful.”\n\n“Let me make them,” said the Story Girl, eagerly. “I can make real good\nrusks now.”\n\n“No, it wouldn’t do to trust you,” said Felicity mercilessly. “You\nmight make some queer mistake and Aunt Eliza would tell it all over the\ncountry. She’s a fearful old gossip. I’ll make the rusks myself. She\nhates cats, so we mustn’t let Paddy be seen. And she’s a Methodist, so\nmind nobody says anything against Methodists to her.”\n\n“Who’s going to say anything, anyhow?” asked Peter belligerently.\n\n“I wonder if I might ask her for her name for my quilt square?”\n speculated Cecily. “I believe I will. She looks so much friendlier than\nI expected. Of course she’ll choose the five-cent section. She’s an\nestimable old lady, but very economical.”\n\n“Why don’t you say she’s so mean she’d skin a flea for its hide and\ntallow?” said Dan. “That’s the plain truth.”\n\n“Well, I’m going to see about getting tea,” said Felicity, “so the rest\nof you will have to entertain her. You better go in and show her the\nphotographs in the album. Dan, you do it.”\n\n“Thank you, that’s a girl’s job,” said Dan. “I’d look nice sitting up\nto Aunt Eliza and yelling out that this was Uncle Jim and ‘tother Cousin\nSarah’s twins, wouldn’t I? Cecily or the Story Girl can do it.”\n\n“I don’t know all the pictures in your album,” said the Story Girl\nhastily.\n\n“I s’pose I’ll have to do it, though I don’t like to,” sighed Cecily.\n“But we ought to go in. We’ve left her alone too long now. She’ll think\nwe have no manners.”\n\nAccordingly we all filed in rather reluctantly. Great-aunt Eliza\nwas toasting her toes--clad, as we noted, in very smart and shapely\nshoes--at the stove and looking quite at her ease. Cecily, determined to\ndo her duty even in the face of such fearful odds as Great-aunt Eliza’s\ndeafness, dragged a ponderous, plush-covered album from its corner and\nproceeded to display and explain the family photographs. She did her\nbrave best but she could not shout like Felicity, and half the time, as\nshe confided to me later on, she felt that Great-aunt Eliza did not hear\none word she said, because she didn’t seem to take in who the people\nwere, though, just like all deaf folks, she wouldn’t let on. Great-aunt\nEliza certainly didn’t talk much; she looked at the photographs in\nsilence, but she smiled now and then. That smile bothered me. It was so\ntwinkly and so very un-great-aunt-Elizaish. But I felt indignant with\nher. I thought she might have shown a little more appreciation of\nCecily’s gallant efforts to entertain.\n\nIt was very dull for the rest of us. The Story Girl sat rather sulkily\nin her corner; she was angry because Felicity would not let her make\nthe rusks, and also, perhaps, a little vexed because she could not charm\nGreat-aunt Eliza with her golden voice and story-telling gift. Felix\nand I looked at each other and wished ourselves out in the hill field,\ncareering gloriously adown its gleaming crust.\n\nBut presently a little amusement came our way. Dan, who was sitting\nbehind Great-aunt Eliza, and consequently out of her view, began making\ncomments on Cecily’s explanation of this one and that one among the\nphotographs. In vain Cecily implored him to stop. It was too good fun\nto give up. For the next half-hour the dialogue ran after this fashion,\nwhile Peter and Felix and I, and even the Story Girl, suffered agonies\ntrying to smother our bursts of laughter--for Great-aunt Eliza could see\nif she couldn’t hear:\n\nCECILY, SHOUTING:--“That is Mr. Joseph Elliott of Markdale, a second\ncousin of mother’s.”\n\nDAN:--“Don’t brag of it, Sis. He’s the man who was asked if somebody\nelse said something in sincerity and old Joe said ‘No, he said it in my\ncellar.’”\n\nCECILY:--“This isn’t anybody in our family. It’s little Xavy Gautier who\nused to be hired with Uncle Roger.”\n\nDAN:--“Uncle Roger sent him to fix a gate one day and scolded him\nbecause he didn’t do it right, and Xavy was mad as hops and said ‘How\nyou ‘spect me to fix dat gate? I never learned jogerfy.’”\n\nCECILY, WITH AN ANGUISHED GLANCE AT DAN:--“This is Great-uncle Robert\nKing.”\n\nDAN:--“He’s been married four times. Don’t you think that’s often\nenough, dear great-aunty?”\n\nCECILY:--“(Dan!!) This is a nephew of Mr. Ambrose Marr’s. He lives out\nwest and teaches school.”\n\nDAN:--“Yes, and Uncle Roger says he doesn’t know enough not to sleep in\na field with the gate open.”\n\nCECILY:--“This is Miss Julia Stanley, who used to teach in Carlisle a\nfew years ago.”\n\nDAN:--“When she resigned the trustees had a meeting to see if they’d ask\nher to stay and raise her supplement. Old Highland Sandy was alive then\nand he got up and said, ‘If she for go let her for went. Perhaps she for\nmarry.’”\n\nCECILY, WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYR:--“This is Mr. Layton, who used to\ntravel around selling Bibles and hymn books and Talmage’s sermons.”\n\nDAN:--“He was so thin Uncle Roger used to say he always mistook him for\na crack in the atmosphere. One time he stayed here all night and went to\nprayer meeting and Mr. Marwood asked him to lead in prayer. It had been\nraining ‘most every day for three weeks, and it was just in haymaking\ntime, and everybody thought the hay was going to be ruined, and old\nLayton got up and prayed that God would send gentle showers on the\ngrowing crops, and I heard Uncle Roger whisper to a fellow behind\nme, ‘If somebody don’t choke him off we won’t get the hay made this\nsummer.’”\n\nCECILY, IN EXASPERATION:--“(Dan, shame on you for telling such\nirreverent stories.) This is Mrs. Alexander Scott of Markdale. She has\nbeen very sick for a long time.”\n\nDAN:--“Uncle Roger says all that keeps her alive is that she’s scared\nher husband will marry again.”\n\nCECILY:--“This is old Mr. James MacPherson who used to live behind the\ngraveyard.”\n\nDAN:--“He’s the man who told mother once that he always made his own\niodine out of strong tea and baking soda.”\n\nCECILY:--“This is Cousin Ebenezer MacPherson on the Markdale road.”\n\nDAN:--“Great temperance man! He never tasted rum in his life. He took\nthe measles when he was forty-five and was crazy as a loon with them,\nand the doctor ordered them to give him a dose of brandy. When he\nswallowed it he looked up and says, solemn as an owl, ‘Give it to me\noftener and more at a time.’”\n\nCECILY, IMPLORINGLY:--“(Dan, do stop. You make me so nervous I don’t\nknow what I’m doing.) This is Mr. Lemuel Goodridge. He is a minister.”\n\nDAN:--“You ought to see his mouth. Uncle Roger says the drawing string\nhas fell out of it. It just hangs loose--so fashion.”\n\nDan, whose own mouth was far from being beautiful, here gave an\nimitation of the Rev. Lemuel’s, to the utter undoing of Peter, Felix,\nand myself. Our wild guffaws of laughter penetrated even Great-aunt\nEliza’s deafness, and she glanced up with a startled face. What we would\nhave done I do not know had not Felicity at that moment appeared in the\ndoorway with panic-stricken eyes and exclaimed,\n\n“Cecily, come here for a moment.”\n\nCecily, glad of even a temporary respite, fled to the kitchen and we\nheard her demanding what was the matter.\n\n“Matter!” exclaimed Felicity, tragically. “Matter enough! Some of you\nleft a soup plate with molasses in it on the pantry table and Pat got\ninto it and what do you think? He went into the spare room and walked\nall over Aunt Eliza’s things on the bed. You can see his tracks plain as\nplain. What in the world can we do? She’ll be simply furious.”\n\nI looked apprehensively at Great-aunt Eliza; but she was gazing\nintently at a picture of Aunt Janet’s sister’s twins, a most stolid,\nuninteresting pair; but evidently Great-aunt Eliza found them amusing\nfor she was smiling widely over them.\n\n“Let us take a little clean water and a soft bit of cotton,” came\nCecily’s clear voice from the kitchen, “and see if we can’t clean the\nmolasses off. The coat and hat are both cloth, and molasses isn’t like\ngrease.”\n\n“Well, we can try, but I wish the Story Girl would keep her cat home,”\n grumbled Felicity.\n\nThe Story Girl here flew out to defend her pet, and we four boys sat on,\nmiserably conscious of Great-aunt Eliza, who never said a word to us,\ndespite her previously expressed desire to become acquainted with us.\nShe kept on looking at the photographs and seemed quite oblivious of our\npresence.\n\nPresently the girls returned, having, as transpired later, been so\nsuccessful in removing the traces of Paddy’s mischief that it was not\ndeemed necessary to worry Great-aunt Eliza with any account of it.\nFelicity announced tea and, while Cecily conveyed Great-aunt Eliza out\nto the dining-room, lingered behind to consult with us for a moment.\n\n“Ought we to ask her to say grace?” she wanted to know.\n\n“I know a story,” said the Story Girl, “about Uncle Roger when he was\njust a young man. He went to the house of a very deaf old lady and when\nthey sat down to the table she asked him to say grace. Uncle Roger had\nnever done such a thing in his life and he turned as red as a beet\nand looked down and muttered, ‘E-r-r, please excuse me--I--I’m not\naccustomed to doing that.’ Then he looked up and the old lady said\n‘Amen,’ loudly and cheerfully. She thought Uncle Roger was saying grace\nall the time.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s right to tell funny stories about such things,” said\nFelicity coldly. “And I asked for your opinion, not for a story.”\n\n“If we don’t ask her, Felix must say it, for he’s the only one who can,\nand we must have it, or she’d be shocked.”\n\n“Oh, ask her--ask her,” advised Felix hastily.\n\nShe was asked accordingly and said grace without any hesitation, after\nwhich she proceeded to eat heartily of the excellent supper Felicity had\nprovided. The rusks were especially good and Great-aunt Eliza ate three\nof them and praised them. Apart from that she said little and during the\nfirst part of the meal we sat in embarrassed silence. Towards the last,\nhowever, our tongues were loosened, and the Story Girl told us a tragic\ntale of old Charlottetown and a governor’s wife who had died of a broken\nheart in the early days of the colony.\n\n“They say that story isn’t true,” said Felicity. “They say what she\nreally died of was indigestion. The Governor’s wife who lives there now\nis a relation of our own. She is a second cousin of father’s but we’ve\nnever seen her. Her name was Agnes Clark. And mind you, when father was\na young man he was dead in love with her and so was she with him.”\n\n“Who ever told you that?” exclaimed Dan.\n\n“Aunt Olivia. And I’ve heard ma teasing father about it, too. Of course,\nit was before father got acquainted with mother.”\n\n“Why didn’t your father marry her?” I asked.\n\n“Well, she just simply wouldn’t marry him in the end. She got over being\nin love with him. I guess she was pretty fickle. Aunt Olivia said father\nfelt awful about it for awhile, but he got over it when he met ma.\nMa was twice as good-looking as Agnes Clark. Agnes was a sight for\nfreckles, so Aunt Olivia says. But she and father remained real good\nfriends. Just think, if she had married him we would have been the\nchildren of the Governor’s wife.”\n\n“But she wouldn’t have been the Governor’s wife then,” said Dan.\n\n“I guess it’s just as good being father’s wife,” declared Cecily\nloyally.\n\n“You might think so if you saw the Governor,” chuckled Dan. “Uncle Roger\nsays it would be no harm to worship him because he doesn’t look like\nanything in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or the waters\nunder the earth.”\n\n“Oh, Uncle Roger just says that because he’s on the opposite side of\npolitics,” said Cecily. “The Governor isn’t really so very ugly. I saw\nhim at the Markdale picnic two years ago. He’s very fat and bald and\nred-faced, but I’ve seen far worse looking men.”\n\n“I’m afraid your seat is too near the stove, Aunt Eliza,” shouted\nFelicity.\n\nOur guest, whose face was certainly very much flushed, shook her head.\n\n“Oh, no, I’m very comfortable,” she said. But her voice had the effect\nof making us uncomfortable. There was a queer, uncertain little sound\nin it. Was Great-aunt Eliza laughing at us? We looked at her sharply\nbut her face was very solemn. Only her eyes had a suspicious appearance.\nSomehow, we did not talk much more the rest of the meal.\n\nWhen it was over Great-aunt Eliza said she was very sorry but she must\nreally go. Felicity politely urged her to stay, but was much relieved\nwhen Great-aunt Eliza adhered to her intention of going. When Felicity\ntook her to the spare room Cecily slipped upstairs and presently came\nback with a little parcel in her hand.\n\n“What have you got there?” demanded Felicity suspiciously.\n\n“A--a little bag of rose-leaves,” faltered Cecily. “I thought I’d give\nthem to Aunt Eliza.”\n\n“The idea! Don’t you do such a thing,” said Felicity contemptuously.\n“She’d think you were crazy.”\n\n“She was awfully nice when I asked her for her name for the quilt,”\n protested Cecily, “and she took a ten-cent section after all. So I’d\nlike to give her the rose-leaves--and I’m going to, too, Miss Felicity.”\n\nGreat-aunt Eliza accepted the little gift quite graciously, bade us\nall good-bye, said she had enjoyed herself very much, left messages for\nfather and mother, and finally betook herself away. We watched her cross\nthe yard, tall, stately, erect, and disappear down the lane. Then,\nas often aforetime, we gathered together in the cheer of the red\nhearth-flame, while outside the wind of a winter twilight sang through\nfair white valleys brimmed with a reddening sunset, and a faint, serene,\nsilver-cold star glimmered over the willow at the gate.\n\n“Well,” said Felicity, drawing a relieved breath, “I’m glad she’s gone.\nShe certainly is queer, just as mother said.”\n\n“It’s a different kind of queerness from what I expected, though,” said\nthe Story Girl meditatively. “There’s something I can’t quite make out\nabout Aunt Eliza. I don’t think I altogether like her.”\n\n“I’m precious sure I don’t,” said Dan.\n\n“Oh, well, never mind. She’s gone now and that’s the last of it,” said\nCecily comfortingly.\n\nBut it wasn’t the last of it--not by any manner of means was it! When\nour grown-ups returned almost the first words Aunt Janet said were,\n\n“And so you had the Governor’s wife to tea?”\n\nWe all stared at her.\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Felicity. “We had nobody to tea\nexcept Great-aunt Eliza. She came this afternoon and--”\n\n“Great-aunt Eliza? Nonsense,” said Aunt Janet. “Aunt Eliza was in town\ntoday. She had tea with us at Aunt Louisa’s. But wasn’t Mrs. Governor\nLesley here? We met her on her way back to Charlottetown and she told\nus she was. She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought\nshe’d call to see father for old acquaintance sake. What in the world\nare all you children staring like that for? Your eyes are like saucers.”\n\n“There was a lady here to tea,” said Felicity miserably, “but we thought\nit was Great-aunt Eliza--she never SAID she wasn’t--I thought she acted\nqueer--and we all yelled at her as if she was deaf--and said things to\neach other about her nose--and Pat running over her clothes--”\n\n“She must have heard all you said while I was showing her the\nphotographs, Dan,” cried Cecily.\n\n“And about the Governor at tea time,” chuckled unrepentant Dan.\n\n“I want to know what all this means,” said Aunt Janet sternly.\n\nShe knew in due time, after she had pieced the story together from\nour disjointed accounts. She was horrified, and Uncle Alec was mildly\ndisturbed, but Uncle Roger roared with laughter and Aunt Olivia echoed\nit.\n\n“To think you should have so little sense!” said Aunt Janet in a\ndisgusted tone.\n\n“I think it was real mean of her to pretend she was deaf,” said\nFelicity, almost on the verge of tears.\n\n“That was Agnes Clark all over,” chuckled Uncle Roger. “How she must\nhave enjoyed this afternoon!”\n\nShe had enjoyed it, as we learned the next day, when a letter came from\nher.\n\n“Dear Cecily and all the rest of you,” wrote the Governor’s wife, “I\nwant to ask you to forgive me for pretending to be Aunt Eliza. I\nsuspect it was a little horrid of me, but really I couldn’t resist the\ntemptation, and if you will forgive me for it I will forgive you for the\nthings you said about the Governor, and we will all be good friends. You\nknow the Governor is a very nice man, though he has the misfortune not\nto be handsome.\n\n“I had just a splendid time at your place, and I envy your Aunt Eliza\nher nephews and nieces. You were all so nice to me, and I didn’t dare\nto be a bit nice to you lest I should give myself away. But I’ll make\nup for that when you come to see me at Government House, as you all must\nthe very next time you come to town. I’m so sorry I didn’t see Paddy,\nfor I love pussy cats, even if they do track molasses over my clothes.\nAnd, Cecily, thank you ever so much for that little bag of pot-pourri.\nIt smells like a hundred rose gardens, and I have put it between the\nsheets for my very sparest room bed, where you shall sleep when you come\nto see me, you dear thing. And the Governor wants you to put his name on\nthe quilt square, too, in the ten-cent section.\n\n“Tell Dan I enjoyed his comments on the photographs very much. They were\nquite a refreshing contrast to the usual explanations of ‘who’s who.’\nAnd Felicity, your rusks were perfection. Do send me your recipe for\nthem, there’s a darling.\n\n“Yours most cordially,\n\n                                AGNES CLARK LESLEY.\n\n\n“Well, it was decent of her to apologize, anyhow,” commented Dan.\n\n“If we only hadn’t said that about the Governor,” moaned Felicity.\n\n“How did you make your rusks?” asked Aunt Janet. “There was no\nbaking-powder in the house, and I never could get them right with soda\nand cream of tartar.”\n\n“There was plenty of baking-powder in the pantry,” said Felicity.\n\n“No, there wasn’t a particle. I used the last making those cookies\nThursday morning.”\n\n“But I found another can nearly full, away back on the top shelf,\nma,--the one with the yellow label. I guess you forgot it was there.”\n\nAunt Janet stared at her pretty daughter blankly. Then amazement gave\nplace to horror.\n\n“Felicity King!” she exclaimed. “You don’t mean to tell me that you\nraised those rusks with the stuff that was in that old yellow can?”\n\n“Yes, I did,” faltered Felicity, beginning to look scared. “Why, ma,\nwhat was the matter with it?”\n\n“Matter! That stuff was TOOTH-POWDER, that’s what it was. Your Cousin\nMyra broke the bottle her tooth-powder was in when she was here last\nwinter and I gave her that old can to keep it in. She forgot to take it\nwhen she went away and I put it on that top shelf. I declare you must\nall have been bewitched yesterday.”\n\nPoor, poor Felicity! If she had not always been so horribly vain over\nher cooking and so scornfully contemptuous of other people’s aspirations\nand mistakes along that line, I could have found it in my heart to pity\nher.\n\nThe Story Girl would have been more than human if she had not betrayed a\nlittle triumphant amusement, but Peter stood up for his lady manfully.\n\n“The rusks were splendid, anyhow, so what difference does it make what\nthey were raised with?”\n\nDan, however, began to taunt Felicity with her tooth-powder rusks, and\nkept it up for the rest of his natural life.\n\n“Don’t forget to send the Governor’s wife the recipe for them,” he said.\n\nFelicity, with eyes tearful and cheeks crimson from mortification,\nrushed from the room, but never, never did the Governor’s wife get the\nrecipe for those rusks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. WE VISIT COUSIN MATTIE’S\n\n\nOne Saturday in March we walked over to Baywater, for a long-talked-of\nvisit to Cousin Mattie Dilke. By the road, Baywater was six miles away,\nbut there was a short cut across hills and fields and woods which was\nscantly three. We did not look forward to our visit with any particular\ndelight, for there was nobody at Cousin Mattie’s except grown-ups who\nhad been grown up so long that it was rather hard for them to remember\nthey had ever been children. But, as Felicity told us, it was necessary\nto visit Cousin Mattie at least once a year, or else she would be\n“huffed,” so we concluded we might as well go and have it over.\n\n“Anyhow, we’ll get a splendiferous dinner,” said Dan. “Cousin Mattie’s a\ngreat cook and there’s nothing stingy about her.”\n\n“You are always thinking of your stomach,” said Felicity pleasantly.\n\n“Well, you know I couldn’t get along very well without it, darling,”\n responded Dan who, since New Year’s, had adopted a new method of dealing\nwith Felicity--whether by way of keeping his resolution or because he\nhad discovered that it annoyed Felicity far more than angry retorts,\ndeponent sayeth not. He invariably met her criticisms with a\ngood-natured grin and a flippant remark with some tender epithet tagged\non to it. Poor Felicity used to get hopelessly furious over it.\n\nUncle Alec was dubious about our going that day. He looked abroad on\nthe general dourness of gray earth and gray air and gray sky, and said\na storm was brewing. But Cousin Mattie had been sent word that we\nwere coming, and she did not like to be disappointed, so he let us go,\nwarning us to stay with Cousin Mattie all night if the storm came on\nwhile we were there.\n\nWe enjoyed our walk--even Felix enjoyed it, although he had been\nappointed to write up the visit for Our Magazine and was rather weighed\ndown by the responsibility of it. What mattered it though the world were\ngray and wintry? We walked the golden road and carried spring time in\nour hearts, and we beguiled our way with laughter and jest, and the\ntales the Story Girl told us--myths and legends of elder time.\n\nThe walking was good, for there had lately been a thaw and everything\nwas frozen. We went over fields, crossed by spidery trails of gray\nfences, where the withered grasses stuck forlornly up through the\nsnow; we lingered for a time in a group of hill pines, great, majestic\ntree-creatures, friends of evening stars; and finally struck into the\nbelt of fir and maple which intervened between Carlisle and Baywater.\nIt was in this locality that Peg Bowen lived, and our way lay near her\nhouse though not directly in sight of it. We hoped we would not meet\nher, for since the affair of the bewitchment of Paddy we did not know\nquite what to think of Peg; the boldest of us held his breath as we\npassed her haunts, and drew it again with a sigh of relief when they\nwere safely left behind.\n\nThe woods were full of the brooding stillness that often precedes a\nstorm, and the wind crept along their white, cone-sprinkled floors with\na low, wailing cry. Around us were solitudes of snow, arcades picked out\nin pearl and silver, long avenues of untrodden marble whence sprang the\ncathedral columns of the firs. We were all sorry when we were through\nthe woods and found ourselves looking down into the snug, commonplace,\nfarmstead-dotted settlement of Baywater.\n\n“There’s Cousin Mattie’s house--that big white one at the turn of the\nroad,” said the Story Girl. “I hope she has that dinner ready, Dan. I’m\nhungry as a wolf after our walk.”\n\n“I wish Cousin Mattie’s husband was still alive,” said Dan. “He was an\nawful nice old man. He always had his pockets full of nuts and apples.\nI used to like going there better when he was alive. Too many old women\ndon’t suit me.”\n\n“Oh, Dan, Cousin Mattie and her sisters-in-law are just as nice and kind\nas they can be,” reproached Cecily.\n\n“Oh, they’re kind enough, but they never seem to see that a fellow gets\nover being five years old if he only lives long enough,” retorted Dan.\n\n“I know a story about Cousin Mattie’s husband,” said the Story Girl.\n“His name was Ebenezer, you know--”\n\n“Is it any wonder he was thin and stunted looking?” said Dan.\n\n“Ebenezer is just as nice a name as Daniel,” said Felicity.\n\n“Do you REALLY think so, my angel?” inquired Dan, in honey-sweet tones.\n\n“Go on. Remember your second resolution,” I whispered to the Story Girl,\nwho was stalking along with an outraged expression.\n\nThe Story Girl swallowed something and went on.\n\n“Cousin Ebenezer had a horror of borrowing. He thought it was simply\na dreadful disgrace to borrow ANYTHING. Well, you know he and Cousin\nMattie used to live in Carlisle, where the Rays now live. This was when\nGrandfather King was alive. One day Cousin Ebenezer came up the hill and\ninto the kitchen where all the family were. Uncle Roger said he looked\nas if he had been stealing sheep. He sat for a whole hour in the kitchen\nand hardly spoke a word, but just looked miserable. At last he got up\nand said in a desperate sort of way, ‘Uncle Abraham, can I speak with\nyou in private for a minute?’ ‘Oh, certainly,’ said grandfather, and\ntook him into the parlour. Cousin Ebenezer shut the door, looked\nall around him and then said imploringly, ‘MORE PRIVATE STILL.’ So\ngrandfather took him into the spare room and shut that door. He was\ngetting frightened. He thought something terrible must have happened\nCousin Ebenezer. Cousin Ebenezer came right up to grandfather, took\nhold of the lapel of his coat, and said in a whisper, ‘Uncle Abraham,\nCAN--YOU--LEND--ME--AN--AXE?’”\n\n“He needn’t have made such a mystery about it,” said Cecily, who had\nmissed the point entirely, and couldn’t see why the rest of us were\nlaughing. But Cecily was such a darling that we did not mind her lack of\na sense of humour.\n\n“It’s kind of mean to tell stories like that about people who are dead,”\n said Felicity.\n\n“Sometimes it’s safer than when they’re alive though, sweetheart,”\n commented Dan.\n\nWe had our expected good dinner at Cousin Mattie’s--may it be counted\nunto her for righteousness. She and her sisters-in-law, Miss Louisa\nJane and Miss Caroline, were very kind to us. We had quite a nice time,\nalthough I understood why Dan objected to them when they patted us\nall on the head and told us whom we resembled and gave us peppermint\nlozenges.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. WE VISIT PEG BOWEN\n\n\nWe left Cousin Mattie’s early, for it still looked like a storm, though\nno more so than it had in the morning. We intended to go home by a\ndifferent path--one leading through cleared land overgrown with scrub\nmaple, which had the advantage of being farther away from Peg Bowen’s\nhouse. We hoped to be home before it began to storm, but we had hardly\nreached the hill above the village when a fine, driving snow began to\nfall. It would have been wiser to have turned back even then; but we\nhad already come a mile and we thought we would have ample time to reach\nhome before it became really bad. We were sadly mistaken; by the time\nwe had gone another half-mile we were in the thick of a bewildering,\nblinding snowstorm. But it was by now just as far back to Cousin\nMattie’s as it was to Uncle Alec’s, so we struggled on, growing more\nfrightened at every step. We could hardly face the stinging snow, and we\ncould not see ten feet ahead of us. It had turned bitterly cold and\nthe tempest howled all around us in white desolation under the\nfast-darkening night. The narrow path we were trying to follow soon\nbecame entirely obliterated and we stumbled blindly on, holding to each\nother, and trying to peer through the furious whirl that filled the air.\nOur plight had come upon us so suddenly that we could not realize it.\nPresently Peter, who was leading the van because he was supposed to know\nthe path best, stopped.\n\n“I can’t see the road any longer,” he shouted. “I don’t know where we\nare.”\n\nWe all stopped and huddled together in a miserable group. Fear filled\nour hearts. It seemed ages ago that we had been snug and safe and warm\nat Cousin Mattie’s. Cecily began to cry with cold. Dan, in spite of her\nprotests, dragged off his overcoat and made her put it on.\n\n“We can’t stay here,” he said. “We’ll all freeze to death if we do. Come\non--we’ve got to keep moving. The snow ain’t so deep yet. Take hold of\nmy hand, Cecily. We must all hold together. Come, now.”\n\n“It won’t be nice to be frozen to death, but if we get through alive\nthink what a story we’ll have to tell,” said the Story Girl between her\nchattering teeth.\n\nIn my heart I did not believe we would ever get through alive. It was\nalmost pitch dark now, and the snow grew deeper every moment. We were\nchilled to the heart. I thought how nice it would be to lie down and\nrest; but I remembered hearing that that was fatal, and I endeavoured to\nstumble on with the others. It was wonderful how the girls kept up, even\nCecily. It occurred to me to be thankful that Sara Ray was not with us.\n\nBut we were wholly lost now. All around us was a horror of great\ndarkness. Suddenly Felicity fell. We dragged her up, but she declared\nshe could not go on--she was done out.\n\n“Have you any idea where we are?” shouted Dan to Peter.\n\n“No,” Peter shouted back, “the wind is blowing every which way. I\nhaven’t any idea where home is.”\n\nHome! Would we ever see it again? We tried to urge Felicity on, but she\nonly repeated drowsily that she must lie down and rest. Cecily, too,\nwas reeling against me. The Story Girl still stood up staunchly and\ncounselled struggling on, but she was numb with cold and her words were\nhardly distinguishable. Some wild idea was in my mind that we must dig a\nhole in the snow and all creep into it. I had read somewhere that people\nhad thus saved their lives in snowstorms. Suddenly Felix gave a shout.\n\n“I see a light,” he cried.\n\n“Where? Where?” We all looked but could see nothing.\n\n“I don’t see it now but I saw it a moment ago,” shouted Felix. “I’m sure\nI did. Come on--over in this direction.”\n\nInspired with fresh hope we hurried after him. Soon we all saw the\nlight--and never shone a fairer beacon. A few more steps and, coming\ninto the shelter of the woodland on the further side, we realized where\nwe were.\n\n“That’s Peg Bowen’s house,” exclaimed Peter, stopping short in dismay.\n\n“I don’t care whose house it is,” declared Dan. “We’ve got to go to it.”\n\n“I s’pose so,” acquiesced Peter ruefully. “We can’t freeze to death even\nif she is a witch.”\n\n“For goodness’ sake don’t say anything about witches so close to her\nhouse,” gasped Felicity. “I’ll be thankful to get in anywhere.”\n\nWe reached the house, climbed the flight of steps that led to that\nmysterious second story door, and Dan rapped. The door opened promptly\nand Peg Bowen stood before us, in what seemed exactly the same costume\nshe had worn on the memorable day when we had come, bearing gifts, to\npropitiate her in the matter of Paddy.\n\n“Behind her was a dim room scantly illumined by the one small candle\nthat had guided us through the storm; but the old Waterloo stove was\ncolouring the gloom with tremulous, rose-red whorls of light, and warm\nand cosy indeed seemed Peg’s retreat to us snow-covered, frost-chilled,\nbenighted wanderers.\n\n“Gracious goodness, where did yez all come from?” exclaimed Peg. “Did\nthey turn yez out?”\n\n“We’ve been over to Baywater, and we got lost in the storm coming back,”\n explained Dan. “We didn’t know where we were till we saw your light.\nI guess we’ll have to stay here till the storm is over--if you don’t\nmind.”\n\n“And if it won’t inconvenience you,” said Cecily timidly.\n\n“Oh, it’s no inconvenience to speak of. Come in. Well, yez HAVE got some\nsnow on yez. Let me get a broom. You boys stomp your feet well and shake\nyour coats. You girls give me your things and I’ll hang them up. Guess\nyez are most froze. Well, sit up to the stove and git het up.”\n\nPeg bustled away to gather up a dubious assortment of chairs, with backs\nand rungs missing, and in a few minutes we were in a circle around her\nroaring stove, getting dried and thawed out. In our wildest flights\nof fancy we had never pictured ourselves as guests at the witch’s\nhearth-stone. Yet here we were; and the witch herself was actually\nbrewing a jorum of ginger tea for Cecily, who continued to shiver long\nafter the rest of us were roasted to the marrow. Poor Sis drank that\nscalding draught, being in too great awe of Peg to do aught else.\n\n“That’ll soon fix your shivers,” said our hostess kindly. “And now I’ll\nget yez all some tea.”\n\n“Oh, please don’t trouble,” said the Story Girl hastily.\n\n“‘Tain’t any trouble,” said Peg briskly; then, with one of the sudden\nchanges to fierceness which made her such a terrifying personage, “Do\nyez think my vittels ain’t clean?”\n\n“Oh, no, no,” cried Felicity quickly, before the Story Girl could speak,\n“none of us would ever think THAT. Sara only meant she didn’t want you\nto go to any bother on our account.”\n\n“It ain’t any bother,” said Peg, mollified. “I’m spry as a cricket this\nwinter, though I have the realagy sometimes. Many a good bite I’ve had\nin your ma’s kitchen. I owe yez a meal.”\n\nNo more protests were made. We sat in awed silence, gazing with timid\ncuriosity about the room, the stained, plastered walls of which were\nwell-nigh covered with a motley assortment of pictures, chromos, and\nadvertisements, pasted on without much regard for order or character.\n\nWe had heard much of Peg’s pets and now we saw them. Six cats occupied\nvarious cosy corners; one of them, the black goblin which had so\nterrified us in the summer, blinked satirically at us from the centre of\nPeg’s bed. Another, a dilapidated, striped beastie, with both ears and\none eye gone, glared at us from the sofa in the corner. A dog, with only\nthree legs, lay behind the stove; a crow sat on a roost above our\nheads, in company with a matronly old hen; and on the clock shelf were\na stuffed monkey and a grinning skull. We had heard that a sailor had\ngiven Peg the monkey. But where had she got the skull? And whose was it?\nI could not help puzzling over these gruesome questions.\n\nPresently tea was ready and we gathered around the festal board--a board\nliterally as well as figuratively, for Peg’s table was the work of her\nown unskilled hands. The less said about the viands of that meal, and\nthe dishes they were served in, the better. But we ate them--bless you,\nyes!--as we would have eaten any witch’s banquet set before us. Peg\nmight or might not be a witch--common sense said not; but we knew she\nwas quite capable of turning every one of us out of doors in one of\nher sudden fierce fits if we offended her; and we had no mind to trust\nourselves again to that wild forest where we had fought a losing fight\nwith the demon forces of night and storm.\n\nBut it was not an agreeable meal in more ways than one. Peg was not\nat all careful of anybody’s feelings. She hurt Felix’s cruelly as she\npassed him his cup of tea.\n\n“You’ve gone too much to flesh, boy. So the magic seed didn’t work,\nhey?”\n\nHow in the world had Peg found out about that magic seed? Felix looked\nuncommonly foolish.\n\n“If you’d come to me in the first place I’d soon have told you how to\nget thin,” said Peg, nodding wisely.\n\n“Won’t you tell me now?” asked Felix eagerly, his desire to melt his too\nsolid flesh overcoming his dread and shame.\n\n“No, I don’t like being second fiddle,” answered Peg with a crafty\nsmile. “Sara, you’re too scrawny and pale--not much like your ma. I knew\nher well. She was counted a beauty, but she made no great things of a\nmatch. Your father had some money but he was a tramp like meself. Where\nis he now?”\n\n“In Rome,” said the Story Girl rather shortly.\n\n“People thought your ma was crazy when she took him. But she’d a right\nto please herself. Folks is too ready to call other folks crazy. There’s\npeople who say I’M not in my right mind. Did yez ever”--Peg fixed\nFelicity with a piercing glance--“hear anything so ridiculous?”\n\n“Never,” said Felicity, white to the lips.\n\n“I wish everybody was as sane as I am,” said Peg scornfully. Then she\nlooked poor Felicity over critically. “You’re good-looking but proud.\nAnd your complexion won’t wear. It’ll be like your ma’s yet--too much\nred in it.”\n\n“Well, that’s better than being the colour of mud,” muttered Peter, who\nwasn’t going to hear his lady traduced, even by a witch. All the thanks\nhe got was a furious look from Felicity, but Peg had not heard him and\nnow she turned her attention to Cecily.\n\n“You look delicate. I daresay you’ll never live to grow up.”\n\nCecily’s lip trembled and Dan’s face turned crimson.\n\n“Shut up,” he said to Peg. “You’ve no business to say such things to\npeople.”\n\nI think my jaw dropped. I know Peter’s and Felix’s did. Felicity broke\nin wildly.\n\n“Oh, don’t mind him, Miss Bowen. He’s got SUCH a temper--that’s just the\nway he talks to us all at home. PLEASE excuse him.”\n\n“Bless you, I don’t mind him,” said Peg, from whom the unexpected seemed\nto be the thing to expect. “I like a lad of spurrit. And so your father\nrun away, did he, Peter? He used to be a beau of mine--he seen me home\nthree times from singing school when we was young. Some folks said he\ndid it for a dare. There’s such a lot of jealousy in the world, ain’t\nthere? Do you know where he is now?”\n\n“No,” said Peter.\n\n“Well, he’s coming home before long,” said Peg mysteriously.\n\n“Who told you that?” cried Peter in amazement.\n\n“Better not ask,” responded Peg, looking up at the skull.\n\nIf she meant to make the flesh creep on our bones she succeeded. But\nnow, much to our relief, the meal was over and Peg invited us to draw\nour chairs up to the stove again.\n\n“Make yourselves at home,” she said, producing her pipe from her pocket.\n“I ain’t one of the kind who thinks their houses too good to live in.\nGuess I won’t bother washing the dishes. They’ll do yez for breakfast if\nyez don’t forget your places. I s’pose none of yez smokes.”\n\n“No,” said Felicity, rather primly.\n\n“Then yez don’t know what’s good for yez,” retorted Peg, rather\ngrumpily. But a few whiffs of her pipe placated her and, observing\nCecily sigh, she asked her kindly what was the matter.\n\n“I’m thinking how worried they’ll be at home about us,” explained\nCecily.\n\n“Bless you, dearie, don’t be worrying over that. I’ll send them word\nthat yez are all snug and safe here.”\n\n“But how can you?” cried amazed Cecily.\n\n“Better not ask,” said Peg again, with another glance at the skull.\n\nAn uncomfortable silence followed, finally broken by Peg, who introduced\nher pets to us and told how she had come by them. The black cat was her\nfavourite.\n\n“That cat knows more than I do, if yez’ll believe it,” she said proudly.\n“I’ve got a rat too, but he’s a bit shy when strangers is round. Your\ncat got all right again that time, didn’t he?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“Thought he would,” said Peg, nodding sagely. “I seen to that. Now,\ndon’t yez all be staring at the hole in my dress.”\n\n“We weren’t,” was our chorus of protest.\n\n“Looked as if yez were. I tore that yesterday but I didn’t mend it. I\nwas brought up to believe that a hole was an accident but a patch was a\ndisgrace. And so your Aunt Olivia is going to be married after all?”\n\nThis was news to us. We felt and looked dazed.\n\n“I never heard anything of it,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“Oh, it’s true enough. She’s a great fool. I’ve no faith in husbands.\nBut one good thing is she ain’t going to marry that Henry Jacobs of\nMarkdale. He wants her bad enough. Just like his presumption,--thinking\nhimself good enough for a King. His father is the worst man alive. He\nchased me off his place with his dog once. But I’ll get even with him\nyet.”\n\nPeg looked very savage, and visions of burned barns floated through our\nminds.\n\n“He’ll be punished in hell, you know,” said Peter timidly.\n\n“But I won’t be there to see that,” rejoined Peg. “Some folks say I’ll\ngo there because I don’t go to church oftener. But I don’t believe it.”\n\n“Why don’t you go?” asked Peter, with a temerity that bordered on\nrashness.\n\n“Well, I’ve got so sunburned I’m afraid folks might take me for an\nInjun,” explained Peg, quite seriously. “Besides, your minister makes\nsuch awful long prayers. Why does he do it?”\n\n“I suppose he finds it easier to talk to God than to people,” suggested\nPeter reflectively.\n\n“Well, anyway, I belong to the round church,” said Peg comfortably, “and\nso the devil can’t catch ME at the corners. I haven’t been to Carlisle\nchurch for over three years. I thought I’d a-died laughing the last time\nI was there. Old Elder Marr took up the collection that day. He’d on a\npair of new boots and they squeaked all the way up and down the aisles.\nAnd every time the boots squeaked the elder made a face, like he had\ntoothache. It was awful funny. How’s your missionary quilt coming on,\nCecily?”\n\nWas there anything Peg didn’t know?\n\n“Very well,” said Cecily.\n\n“You can put my name on it, if you want to.”\n\n“Oh, thank you. Which section--the five-cent one or the ten-cent one?”\n asked Cecily timidly.\n\n“The ten-cent one, of course. The best is none too good for me. I’ll\ngive you the ten cents another time. I’m short of change just now--not\nbeing as rich as Queen Victory. There’s her picture up there--the one\nwith the blue sash and diamint crown and the lace curting on her head.\nCan any of yez tell me this--is Queen Victory a married woman?”\n\n“Oh, yes, but her husband is dead,” answered the Story Girl.\n\n“Well, I s’pose they couldn’t have called her an old maid, seeing she\nwas a queen, even if she’d never got married. Sometimes I sez to myself,\n‘Peg, would you like to be Queen Victory?’ But I never know what\nto answer. In summer, when I can roam anywhere in the woods and the\nsunshine--I wouldn’t be Queen Victory for anything. But when it’s winter\nand cold and I can’t git nowheres--I feel as if I wouldn’t mind changing\nplaces with her.”\n\nPeg put her pipe back in her mouth and began to smoke fiercely. The\ncandle wick burned long, and was topped by a little cap of fiery red\nthat seemed to wink at us like an impish gnome. The most grotesque\nshadow of Peg flickered over the wall behind her. The one-eyed cat\nremitted his grim watch and went to sleep. Outside the wind screamed\nlike a ravening beast at the window. Suddenly Peg removed her pipe from\nher mouth, bent forward, gripped my wrist with her sinewy fingers until\nI almost cried out with pain, and gazed straight into my face. I felt\nhorribly frightened of her. She seemed an entirely different creature. A\nwild light was in her eyes, a furtive, animal-like expression was on\nher face. When she spoke it was in a different voice and in different\nlanguage.\n\n“Do you hear the wind?” she asked in a thrilling whisper. “What IS the\nwind? What IS the wind?”\n\n“I--I--don’t know,” I stammered.\n\n“No more do I,” said Peg, “and nobody knows. Nobody knows what the wind\nis. I wish I could find out. I mightn’t be so afraid of the wind if I\nknew what it was. I am afraid of it. When the blasts come like that I\nwant to crouch down and hide me. But I can tell you one thing about the\nwind--it’s the only free thing in the world--THE--ONLY--FREE--THING.\nEverything else is subject to some law, but the wind is FREE. It bloweth\nwhere it listeth and no man can tame it. It’s free--that’s why I\nlove it, though I’m afraid of it. It’s a grand thing to be free--free\nfree--free!”\n\nPeg’s voice rose almost to a shriek. We were dreadfully frightened, for\nwe knew there were times when she was quite crazy and we feared one of\nher “spells” was coming on her. But with a swift movement she turned\nthe man’s coat she wore up over her shoulders and head like a hood,\ncompletely hiding her face. Then she crouched forward, elbows on knees,\nand relapsed into silence. None of us dared speak or move. We sat thus\nfor half an hour. Then Peg jumped up and said briskly in her usual tone,\n\n“Well, I guess yez are all sleepy and ready for bed. You girls can sleep\nin my bed over there, and I’ll take the sofy. Yez can put the cat off if\nyez like, though he won’t hurt yez. You boys can go downstairs. There’s\na big pile of straw there that’ll do yez for a bed, if yez put your\ncoats on. I’ll light yez down, but I ain’t going to leave yez a light\nfor fear yez’d set fire to the place.”\n\nSaying good-night to the girls, who looked as if they thought their last\nhour was come, we went to the lower room. It was quite empty, save for a\npile of fire wood and another of clean straw. Casting a stealthy glance\naround, ere Peg withdrew the light, I was relieved to see that there\nwere no skulls in sight. We four boys snuggled down in the straw. We did\nnot expect to sleep, but we were very tired and before we knew it our\neyes were shut, to open no more till morning. The poor girls were not\nso fortunate. They always averred they never closed an eye. Four things\nprevented them from sleeping. In the first place Peg snored loudly; in\nthe second place the fitful gleams of firelight kept flickering over the\nskull for half the night and making gruesome effects on it; in the third\nplace Peg’s pillows and bedclothes smelled rankly of tobacco smoke; and\nin the fourth place they were afraid the rat Peg had spoken of might\ncome out to make their acquaintance. Indeed, they were sure they heard\nhim skirmishing about several times.\n\nWhen we wakened in the morning the storm was over and a young morning\nwas looking through rosy eyelids across a white world. The little\nclearing around Peg’s cabin was heaped with dazzling drifts, and we\nboys fell to and shovelled out a road to her well. She gave us\nbreakfast--stiff oatmeal porridge without milk, and a boiled egg apiece.\nCecily could NOT eat her porridge; she declared she had such a bad\ncold that she had no appetite; a cold she certainly had; the rest of us\nchoked our messes down and after we had done so Peg asked us if we had\nnoticed a soapy taste.\n\n“The soap fell into the porridge while I was making it,” she said.\n“But,”--smacking her lips,--“I’m going to make yez an Irish stew for\ndinner. It’ll be fine.”\n\nAn Irish stew concocted by Peg! No wonder Dan said hastily,\n\n“You are very kind but we’ll have to go right home.”\n\n“Yez can’t walk,” said Peg.\n\n“Oh, yes, we can. The drifts are so hard they’ll carry, and the snow\nwill be pretty well blown off the middle of the fields. It’s only\nthree-quarters of a mile. We boys will go home and get a pung and come\nback for you girls.”\n\nBut the girls wouldn’t listen to this. They must go with us, even\nCecily.\n\n“Seems to me yez weren’t in such a hurry to leave last night,” observed\nPeg sarcastically.\n\n“Oh, it’s only because they’ll be so anxious about us at home, and it’s\nSunday and we don’t want to miss Sunday School,” explained Felicity.\n\n“Well, I hope your Sunday School will do yez good,” said Peg, rather\ngrumpily. But she relented again at the last and gave Cecily a wishbone.\n\n“Whatever you wish on that will come true,” she said. “But you only have\nthe one wish, so don’t waste it.”\n\n“We’re so much obliged to you for all your trouble,” said the Story Girl\npolitely.\n\n“Never mind the trouble. The expense is the thing,” retorted Peg grimly.\n\n“Oh!” Felicity hesitated. “If you would let us pay you--give you\nsomething--”\n\n“No, thank yez,” responded Peg loftily. “There is people who take money\nfor their hospitality, I’ve heerd, but I’m thankful to say I don’t\nassociate with that class. Yez are welcome to all yez have had here, if\nyez ARE in a big hurry to get away.”\n\nShe shut the door behind us with something of a slam, and her black\ncat followed us so far, with stealthy, furtive footsteps, that we were\nfrightened of it. Eventually it turned back; then, and not till then,\ndid we feel free to discuss our adventure.\n\n“Well, I’m thankful we’re out of THAT,” said Felicity, drawing a long\nbreath. “Hasn’t it just been an awful experience?”\n\n“We might all have been found frozen stark and stiff this morning,”\n remarked the Story Girl with apparent relish.\n\n“I tell you, it was a lucky thing we got to Peg Bowen’s,” said Dan.\n\n“Miss Marwood says there is no such thing as luck,” protested Cecily.\n“We ought to say it was Providence instead.”\n\n“Well, Peg and Providence don’t seem to go together very well, somehow,”\n retorted Dan. “If Peg is a witch it must be the Other One she’s in co.\nwith.”\n\n“Dan, it’s getting to be simply scandalous the way you talk,” said\nFelicity. “I just wish ma could hear you.”\n\n“Is soap in porridge any worse than tooth-powder in rusks, lovely\ncreature?” asked Dan.\n\n“Dan, Dan,” admonished Cecily, between her coughs, “remember it’s\nSunday.”\n\n“It seems hard to remember that,” said Peter. “It doesn’t seem a mite\nlike Sunday and it seems awful long since yesterday.”\n\n“Cecily, you’ve got a dreadful cold,” said the Story Girl anxiously.\n\n“In spite of Peg’s ginger tea,” added Felix.\n\n“Oh, that ginger tea was AWFUL,” exclaimed poor Cecily. “I thought I’d\nnever get it down--it was so hot with ginger--and there was so much of\nit! But I was so frightened of offending Peg I’d have tried to drink it\nall if there had been a bucketful. Oh, yes, it’s very easy for you all\nto laugh! You didn’t have to drink it.”\n\n“We had to eat two meals, though,” said Felicity with a shiver. “And I\ndon’t know when those dishes of hers were washed. I just shut my eyes\nand took gulps.”\n\n“Did you notice the soapy taste in the porridge?” asked the Story Girl.\n\n“Oh, there were so many queer tastes about it I didn’t notice one more\nthan another,” answered Felicity wearily.\n\n“What bothers me,” remarked Peter absently, “is that skull. Do you\nsuppose Peg really finds things out by it?”\n\n“Nonsense! How could she?” scoffed Felix, bold as a lion in daylight.\n\n“She didn’t SAY she did, you know,” I said cautiously.\n\n“Well, we’ll know in time if the things she said were going to happen\ndo,” mused Peter.\n\n“Do you suppose your father is really coming home?” queried Felicity.\n\n“I hope not,” answered Peter decidedly.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Felicity severely.\n\n“No, I oughtn’t. Father got drunk all the time he was home, and wouldn’t\nwork and was bad to mother,” said Peter defiantly. “She had to support\nhim as well as herself and me. I don’t want to see any father coming\nhome, and you’d better believe it. Of course, if he was the right sort\nof a father it’d be different.”\n\n“What I would like to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married,”\n said the Story Girl absently. “I can hardly believe it. But now that\nI think of it--Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in\nHalifax last summer.”\n\n“If she does get married you’ll have to come and live with us,” said\nCecily delightedly.\n\nFelicity did not betray so much delight and the Story Girl remarked with\na weary little sigh that she hoped Aunt Olivia wouldn’t. We all felt\nrather weary, somehow. Peg’s predictions had been unsettling, and our\nnerves had all been more or less strained during our sojourn under her\nroof. We were glad when we found ourselves at home.\n\nThe folks had not been at all troubled about us, but it was because they\nwere sure the storm had come up before we would think of leaving Cousin\nMattie’s and not because they had received any mysterious message from\nPeg’s skull. We were relieved at this, but on the whole, our adventure\nhad not done much towards clearing up the vexed question of Peg’s\nwitchcraft.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. EXTRACTS FROM THE FEBRUARY AND MARCH NUMBERS OF “OUR\nMAGAZINE”\n\n\nRESOLUTION HONOUR ROLL\n\nMiss Felicity King.\n\n\nHONOURABLE MENTION\n\nMr. Felix King. Mr. Peter Craig. Miss Sara Ray.\n\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nThe editor wishes to make a few remarks about the Resolution Honour\nRoll. As will be seen, only one name figures on it. Felicity says she\nhas thought a beautiful thought every morning before breakfast without\nmissing one morning, not even the one we were at Peg Bowen’s. Some of\nour number think it not fair that Felicity should be on the honour\nroll (FELICITY, ASIDE: “That’s Dan, of course.”) when she only made one\nresolution and won’t tell us what any of the thoughts were. So we\nhave decided to give honourable mention to everybody who has kept one\nresolution perfect. Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by\nhimself. He complains that he never got more than a third of them\nright and the teacher has marked him away down; but one cannot keep\nresolutions without some inconvenience. Peter has never played tit-tat-x\nin church or got drunk and says it wasn’t as bad as he expected. (PETER,\nINDIGNANTLY: “I never said it.” CECILY, SOOTHINGLY: “Now, Peter, Bev\nonly meant that as a joke.”) Sara Ray has never talked any mean gossip,\nbut does not find conversation as interesting as it used to be. (SARA\nRAY, WONDERINGLY: “I don’t remember of saying that.”)\n\nFelix did not eat any apples until March, but forgot and ate seven the\nday we were at Cousin Mattie’s. (FELIX: “I only ate five!”) He soon gave\nup trying to say what he thought always. He got into too much trouble.\nWe think Felix ought to change to old Grandfather King’s rule. It was,\n“Hold your tongue when you can, and when you can’t tell the truth.”\n Cecily feels she has not read all the good books she might, because some\nshe tried to read were very dull and the Pansy books were so much more\ninteresting. And it is no use trying not to feel bad because her hair\nisn’t curly and she has marked that resolution out. The Story Girl came\nvery near to keeping her resolution to have all the good times possible,\nbut she says she missed two, if not three, she might have had. Dan\nrefuses to say anything about his resolutions and so does the editor.\n\n\nPERSONALS\n\nWe regret that Miss Cecily King is suffering from a severe cold.\n\nMr. Alexander Marr of Markdale died very suddenly last week. We never\nheard of his death till he was dead.\n\nMiss Cecily King wishes to state that she did not ask the question about\n“Holy Moses” and the other word in the January number. Dan put it in for\na mean joke.\n\nThe weather has been cold and fine. We have only had one bad storm. The\ncoasting on Uncle Roger’s hill continues good.\n\nAunt Eliza did not favour us with a visit after all. She took cold and\nhad to go home. We were sorry that she had a cold but glad that she had\nto go home. Cecily said she thought it wicked of us to be glad. But when\nwe asked her “cross her heart” if she wasn’t glad herself she had to say\nshe was.\n\nMiss Cecily King has got three very distinguished names on her quilt\nsquare. They are the Governor and his wife and a witch’s.\n\nThe King family had the honour of entertaining the Governor’s wife to\ntea on February the seventeenth. We are all invited to visit Government\nHouse but some of us think we won’t go.\n\nA tragic event occurred last Tuesday. Mrs. James Frewen came to tea and\nthere was no pie in the house. Felicity has not yet fully recovered.\n\nA new boy is coming to school. His name is Cyrus Brisk and his folks\nmoved up from Markdale. He says he is going to punch Willy Fraser’s head\nif Willy keeps on thinking he is Miss Cecily King’s beau.\n\n(CECILY: “I haven’t ANY beau! I don’t mean to think of such a thing for\nat least eight years yet!”)\n\nMiss Alice Reade of Charlottetown Royalty has come to Carlisle to teach\nmusic. She boards at Mr. Peter Armstrong’s. The girls are all going to\ntake music lessons from her. Two descriptions of her will be found in\nanother column. Felix wrote one, but the girls thought he did not do her\njustice, so Cecily wrote another one. She admits she copied most of the\ndescription out of Valeria H. Montague’s story Lord Marmaduke’s First,\nLast, and Only Love; or the Bride of the Castle by the Sea, but says\nthey fit Miss Reade better than anything she could make up.\n\n\nHOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT\n\nAlways keep the kitchen tidy and then you needn’t mind if company comes\nunexpectedly.\n\nANXIOUS INQUIRER: We don’t know anything that will take the stain out\nof a silk dress when a soft-boiled egg is dropped on it. Better not wear\nyour silk dress so often, especially when boiling eggs.\n\nGinger tea is good for colds.\n\nOLD HOUSEKEEPER: Yes, when the baking-powder gives out you can use\ntooth-powder instead.\n\n(FELICITY: “I never wrote that! I don’t care, I don’t think it’s fair\nfor other people to be putting things in my department!”)\n\nOur apples are not keeping well this year. They are rotting; and besides\nfather says we eat an awful lot of them.\n\nPERSEVERANCE: I will give you the recipe for dumplings you ask for.\nBut remember it is not everyone who can make dumplings, even from the\nrecipe.

They were all well\nthere and we had a fine dinner. On our way back a snow-storm came up and\nwe got lost in the woods. We didn’t know where we were or nothing. If we\nhadn’t seen a light I guess we’d all have been frozen and snowed over,\nand they would never have found us till spring and that would be very\nsad. But we saw a light and made for it and it was Peg Bowen’s. Some\npeople think she is a witch and it’s hard to tell, but she was real\nhospitable and took us all in. Her house was very untidy but it was\nwarm. She has a skull. I mean a loose skull, not her own. She lets on it\ntells her things, but Uncle Alec says it couldn’t because it was only an\nIndian skull that old Dr. Beecham had and Peg stole it when he died,\nbut Uncle Roger says he wouldn’t trust himself with Peg’s skull for\nanything. She gave us supper. It was a horrid meal. The Story Girl says\nI must not tell what I found in the bread and butter because it would\nbe too disgusting to read in Our Magazine but it don’t matter because\nwe were all there, except Sara Ray, and know what it was. We stayed all\nnight and us boys slept in straw. None of us had ever slept on straw\nbefore. We got home in the morning. That is all I can write about our\nvisit to Cousin Mattie’s.\n\n                                        FELIX KING.\n\n\nMY WORST ADVENTURE\n\nIt’s my turn to write it so I suppose I must. I guess my worst adventure\nwas two years ago when a whole lot of us were coasting on Uncle Rogers\nhill. Charlie Cowan and Fred Marr had started, but half-way down their\nsled got stuck and I run down to shove them off again. Then I stood\nthere just a moment to watch them with my back to the top of the hill.\nWhile I was standing there Rob Marr started Kitty and Em Frewen off on\nhis sled. His sled had a wooden tongue in it and it slanted back over\nthe girls’ heads. I was right in the way and they yelled to me to get\nout, but just as I heard them it struck me. The sled took me between the\nlegs and I was histed back over the tongue and dropped in a heap behind\nbefore I knew what had happened to me. I thought a tornado had struck\nme. The girls couldn’t stop though they thought I was killed, but Rob\ncame tearing down and helped me up. He was awful scared but I wasn’t\nkilled nor my back wasn’t broken but my nose bled something awful and\nkept on bleeding for three days. Not all the time but by spells.\n\n                                          DAN KING.\n\n\nTHE STORY OF HOW CARLISLE GOT ITS NAME\n\nThis is a true story to. Long ago there was a girl lived in charlotte\ntown. I dont know her name so I cant right it and maybe it is just as\nwell for Felicity might think it wasnt romantik like Miss Jemima Parrs.\nShe was awful pretty and a young englishman who had come out to make his\nfortune fell in love with her and they were engaged to be married the\nnext spring. His name was Mr. Carlisle. In the winter he started off to\nhunt cariboo for a spell. Cariboos lived on the island then. There aint\nany here now. He got to where it is Carlisle now. It wasn’t anything\nthen only woods and a few indians. He got awful sick and was sick for\never so long in a indian camp and only an old micmac squaw to wait on\nhim. Back in town they all thought he was dead and his girl felt bad for\na little while and then got over it and took up with another beau. The\ngirls say that wasnt romantik but I think it was sensible but if it had\nbeen me that died I’d have felt bad if she forgot me so soon. But he\nhadnt died and when he got back to town he went right to her house\nand walked in and there she was standing up to be married to the other\nfellow. Poor Mr. Carlisle felt awful. He was sick and week and it went\nto his head. He just turned and run and run till he got back to the old\nmicmac’s camp and fell in front of it. But the indians had gone because\nit was spring and it didnt matter because he really was dead this time\nand people come looking for him from town and found him and buryed him\nthere and called the place after him. They say the girl was never happy\nagain and that was hard lines on her but maybe she deserved it.\n\n                                       PETER CRAIG.\n\n\nMISS ALICE READE\n\nMiss Alice Reade is a very pretty girl. She has kind of curly blackish\nhair and big gray eyes and a pale face. She is tall and thin but her\nfigure is pretty fair and she has a nice mouth and a sweet way of\nspeaking. The girls are crazy about her and talk about her all the time.\n\n                                        FELIX KING.\n\n\nBEAUTIFUL ALICE\n\nThat is what we girls call Miss Reade among ourselves. She is divinely\nbeautiful. Her magnificent wealth of raven hair flows back in glistening\nwaves from her sun-kissed brow. (DAN: “If Felix had said she was\nsunburned you’d have all jumped on him.” (CECILY, COLDLY: “Sun-kissed\ndoesn’t mean sunburned.” DAN: “What does it mean then?” CECILY,\nEMBARRASSED: “I--I don’t know. But Miss Montague says the Lady\nGeraldine’s brow was sun-kissed and of course an earl’s daughter\nwouldn’t be sunburned. “THE STORY GIRL: “Oh, don’t interrupt the reading\nlike this. It spoils it.”) Her eyes are gloriously dark and deep, like\nmidnight lakes mirroring the stars of heaven. Her features are like\nsculptured marble and her mouth is a trembling, curving Cupid’s bow.\n(PETER, ASIDE: “What kind of a thing is that?”) Her creamy skin is as\nfair and flawless as the petals of a white lily. Her voice is like the\nripple of a woodland brook and her slender form is matchless in its\nsymmetry. (DAN: “That’s Valeria’s way of putting it, but Uncle Roger\nsays she don’t show her feed much.” FELICITY: “Dan! if Uncle Roger is\nvulgar you needn’t be!”) Her hands are like a poet’s dreams. She dresses\nso nicely and looks so stylish in her clothes. Her favourite colour is\nblue. Some people think she is stiff and some say she is stuck-up, but\nshe isn’t a bit. It’s just that she is different from them and they\ndon’t like it. She is just lovely and we adore her.)\n\n                                       CECILY KING.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. DISAPPEARANCE OF PADDY\n\n\nAs I remember, the spring came late that year in Carlisle. It was May\nbefore the weather began to satisfy the grown-ups. But we children were\nmore easily pleased, and we thought April a splendid month because the\nsnow all went early and left gray, firm, frozen ground for our rambles\nand games. As the days slipped by they grew more gracious; the hillsides\nbegan to look as if they were thinking of mayflowers; the old orchard\nwas washed in a bath of tingling sunshine and the sap stirred in the\nbig trees; by day the sky was veiled with delicate cloud drift, fine and\nfilmy as woven mist; in the evenings a full, low moon looked over the\nvalleys, as pallid and holy as some aureoled saint; a sound of laughter\nand dream was on the wind and the world grew young with the mirth of\nApril breezes.\n\n“It’s so nice to be alive in the spring,” said the Story Girl one\ntwilight as we swung on the boughs of Uncle Stephen’s walk.\n\n“It’s nice to be alive any time,” said Felicity, complacently.\n\n“But it’s nicer in the spring,” insisted the Story Girl. “When I’m dead\nI think I’ll FEEL dead all the rest of the year, but when spring comes\nI’m sure I’ll feel like getting up and being alive again.”\n\n“You do say such queer things,” complained Felicity. “You won’t be\nreally dead any time. You’ll be in the next world. And I think it’s\nhorrid to talk about people being dead anyhow.”\n\n“We’ve all got to die,” said Sara Ray solemnly, but with a certain\nrelish. It was as if she enjoyed looking forward to something in which\nnothing, neither an unsympathetic mother, nor the cruel fate which had\nmade her a colourless little nonentity, could prevent her from being the\nchief performer.\n\n“I sometimes think,” said Cecily, rather wearily, “that it isn’t so\ndreadful to die young as I used to suppose.”\n\nShe prefaced her remark with a slight cough, as she had been all too apt\nto do of late, for the remnants of the cold she had caught the night we\nwere lost in the storm still clung to her.\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense, Cecily,” cried the Story Girl with unwonted\nsharpness, a sharpness we all understood. All of us, in our hearts,\nthough we never spoke of it to each other, thought Cecily was not as\nwell as she ought to be that spring, and we hated to hear anything said\nwhich seemed in any way to touch or acknowledge the tiny, faint shadow\nwhich now and again showed itself dimly athwart our sunshine.\n\n“Well, it was you began talking of being dead,” said Felicity angrily.\n“I don’t think it’s right to talk of such things. Cecily, are you sure\nyour feet ain’t damp? We ought to go in anyhow--it’s too chilly out here\nfor you.”\n\n“You girls had better go,” said Dan, “but I ain’t going in till old\nIsaac Frewen goes. I’ve no use for him.”\n\n“I hate him, too,” said Felicity, agreeing with Dan for once in her\nlife. “He chews tobacco all the time and spits on the floor--the horrid\npig!”\n\n“And yet his brother is an elder in the church,” said Sara Ray\nwonderingly.\n\n“I know a story about Isaac Frewen,” said the Story Girl. “When he was\nyoung he went by the name of Oatmeal Frewen and he got it this way. He\nwas noted for doing outlandish things. He lived at Markdale then and he\nwas a great, overgrown, awkward fellow, six feet tall. He drove over to\nBaywater one Saturday to visit his uncle there and came home the next\nafternoon, and although it was Sunday he brought a big bag of oatmeal in\nthe wagon with him. When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service\nwas going on there, and he concluded to stop and go in. But he didn’t\nlike to leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it,\nbecause there were always mischievous boys around, so he hoisted the bag\non his back and walked into church with it and right to the top of the\naisle to Grandfather King’s pew. Grandfather King used to say he\nwould never forget it to his dying day. The minister was preaching and\neverything was quiet and solemn when he heard a snicker behind him.\nGrandfather King turned around with a terrible frown--for you know in\nthose days it was thought a dreadful thing to laugh in church--to rebuke\nthe offender; and what did he see but that great, hulking young Isaac\nstalking up the aisle, bending a little forward under the weight of a\nbig bag of oatmeal? Grandfather King was so amazed he couldn’t laugh,\nbut almost everyone else in the church was laughing, and grandfather\nsaid he never blamed them, for no funnier sight was ever seen. Young\nIsaac turned into grandfather’s pew and thumped the bag of oatmeal down\non the seat with a thud that cracked it. Then he plumped down beside\nit, took off his hat, wiped his face, and settled back to listen to the\nsermon, just as if it was all a matter of course. When the service was\nover he hoisted his bag up again, marched out of church, and drove home.\nHe could never understand why it made so much talk; but he was known by\nthe name of Oatmeal Frewen for years.”\n\nOur laughter, as we separated, rang sweetly through the old orchard and\nacross the far, dim meadows. Felicity and Cecily went into the house\nand Sara Ray and the Story Girl went home, but Peter decoyed me into the\ngranary to ask advice.\n\n“You know Felicity has a birthday next week,” he said, “and I want to\nwrite her an ode.”\n\n“A--a what?” I gasped.\n\n“An ode,” repeated Peter, gravely. “It’s poetry, you know. I’ll put it\nin Our Magazine.”\n\n“But you can’t write poetry, Peter,” I protested.\n\n“I’m going to try,” said Peter stoutly. “That is, if you think she won’t\nbe offended at me.”\n\n“She ought to feel flattered,” I replied.\n\n“You never can tell how she’ll take things,” said Peter gloomily. “Of\ncourse I ain’t going to sign my name, and if she ain’t pleased I won’t\ntell her I wrote it. Don’t you let on.”\n\nI promised I wouldn’t and Peter went off with a light heart. He said he\nmeant to write two lines every day till he got it done.\n\nCupid was playing his world-old tricks with others than poor Peter that\nspring. Allusion has been made in these chronicles to one, Cyrus Brisk,\nand to the fact that our brown-haired, soft-voiced Cecily had found\nfavour in the eyes of the said Cyrus. Cecily did not regard her conquest\nwith any pride. On the contrary, it annoyed her terribly to be teased\nabout Cyrus. She declared she hated both him and his name. She was as\nuncivil to him as sweet Cecily could be to anyone, but the gallant Cyrus\nwas nothing daunted. He laid determined siege to Cecily’s young heart by\nall the methods known to love-lorn swains. He placed delicate tributes\nof spruce gum, molasses taffy, “conversation” candies and decorated\nslate pencils on her desk; he persistently “chose” her in all school\ngames calling for a partner; he entreated to be allowed to carry her\nbasket from school; he offered to work her sums for her; and rumour had\nit that he had made a wild statement to the effect that he meant to\nask if he might see her home some night from prayer meeting. Cecily was\nquite frightened that he would; she confided to me that she would rather\ndie than walk home with him, but that if he asked her she would be too\nbashful to say no. So far, however, Cyrus had not molested her out of\nschool, nor had he as yet thumped Willy Fraser--who was reported to be\nvery low in his spirits over the whole affair.\n\nAnd now Cyrus had written Cecily a letter--a love letter, mark you.\nMoreover, he had sent it through the post-office, with a real stamp\non it. Its arrival made a sensation among us. Dan brought it from the\noffice and, recognizing the handwriting of Cyrus, gave Cecily no peace\nuntil she showed us the letter. It was a very sentimental and rather\nill-spelled epistle in which the inflammable Cyrus reproached her in\nheart-rending words for her coldness, and begged her to answer his\nletter, saying that if she did he would keep the secret “in violets.”\n Cyrus probably meant “inviolate” but Cecily thought it was intended for\na poetical touch. He signed himself “your troo lover, Cyrus Brisk” and\nadded in a postcript that he couldn’t eat or sleep for thinking of her.\n\n“Are you going to answer it?” asked Dan.\n\n“Certainly not,” said Cecily with dignity.\n\n“Cyrus Brisk wants to be kicked,” growled Felix, who never seemed to be\nany particular friend of Willy Fraser’s either. “He’d better learn how\nto spell before he takes to writing love letters.”\n\n“Maybe Cyrus will starve to death if you don’t,” suggested Sara Ray.\n\n“I hope he will,” said Cecily cruelly. She was truly vexed over the\nletter; and yet, so contradictory a thing is the feminine heart, even at\ntwelve years old, I think she was a little flattered by it also. It was\nher first love letter and she confided to me that it gives you a very\nqueer feeling to get it. At all events--the letter, though unanswered,\nwas not torn up. I feel sure Cecily preserved it. But she walked past\nCyrus next morning at school with a frozen countenance, evincing not the\nslightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection. Cecily winced when\nPat caught a mouse, visited a school chum the day the pigs were killed\nthat she might not hear their squealing, and would not have stepped on a\ncaterpillar for anything; yet she did not care at all how much she made\nthe brisk Cyrus suffer.\n\nThen, suddenly, all our spring gladness and Maytime hopes were blighted\nas by a killing frost. Sorrow and anxiety pervaded our days and\nembittered our dreams by night. Grim tragedy held sway in our lives for\nthe next fortnight.\n\nPaddy disappeared. One night he lapped his new milk as usual at Uncle\nRoger’s dairy door and then sat blandly on the flat stone before it,\ngiving the world assurance of a cat, sleek sides glistening, plumy tail\ngracefully folded around his paws, brilliant eyes watching the stir and\nflicker of bare willow boughs in the twilight air above him. That was\nthe last seen of him. In the morning he was not.\n\nAt first we were not seriously alarmed. Paddy was no roving Thomas,\nbut occasionally he vanished for a day or so. But when two days passed\nwithout his return we became anxious, the third day worried us greatly,\nand the fourth found us distracted.\n\n“Something has happened to Pat,” the Story Girl declared miserably. “He\nnever stayed away from home more than two days in his life.”\n\n“What could have happened to him?” asked Felix.\n\n“He’s been poisoned--or a dog has killed him,” answered the Story Girl\nin tragic tones.\n\nCecily began to cry at this; but tears were of no avail. Neither was\nanything else, apparently. We searched every nook and cranny of barns\nand out-buildings and woods on both the King farms; we inquired far and\nwide; we roved over Carlisle meadows calling Paddy’s name, until Aunt\nJanet grew exasperated and declared we must stop making such exhibitions\nof ourselves. But we found and heard no trace of our lost pet. The Story\nGirl moped and refused to be comforted; Cecily declared she could not\nsleep at night for thinking of poor Paddy dying miserably in some corner\nto which he had dragged his failing body, or lying somewhere mangled and\ntorn by a dog. We hated every dog we saw on the ground that he might be\nthe guilty one.\n\n“It’s the suspense that’s so hard,” sobbed the Story Girl. “If I just\nknew what had happened to him it wouldn’t be QUITE so hard. But I don’t\nknow whether he’s dead or alive. He may be living and suffering, and\nevery night I dream that he has come home and when I wake up and find\nit’s only a dream it just breaks my heart.”\n\n“It’s ever so much worse than when he was so sick last fall,” said\nCecily drearily. “Then we knew that everything was done for him that\ncould be done.”\n\nWe could not appeal to Peg Bowen this time. In our desperation we would\nhave done it, but Peg was far away. With the first breath of spring she\nwas up and off, answering to the lure of the long road. She had not\nbeen seen in her accustomed haunts for many a day. Her pets were gaining\ntheir own living in the woods and her house was locked up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. THE WITCH’S WISHBONE\n\n\nWhen a fortnight had elapsed we gave up all hope.\n\n“Pat is dead,” said the Story Girl hopelessly, as we returned one\nevening from a bootless quest to Andrew Cowan’s where a strange gray\ncat had been reported--a cat which turned out to be a yellowish brown\nnondescript, with no tail to speak of.\n\n“I’m afraid so,” I acknowledged at last.\n\n“If only Peg Bowen had been at home she could have found him for us,”\n asserted Peter. “Her skull would have told her where he was.”\n\n“I wonder if the wishbone she gave me would have done any good,” cried\nCecily suddenly. “I’d forgotten all about it. Oh, do you suppose it’s\ntoo late yet?”\n\n“There’s nothing in a wishbone,” said Dan impatiently.\n\n“You can’t be sure. She TOLD me I’d get the wish I made on it. I’m going\nto try whenever I get home.”\n\n“It can’t do any harm, anyhow,” said Peter, “but I’m afraid you’ve left\nit too late. If Pat is dead even a witch’s wishbone can’t bring him back\nto life.”\n\n“I’ll never forgive myself for not thinking about it before,” mourned\nCecily.\n\nAs soon as we got home she flew to the little box upstairs where she\nkept her treasures, and brought therefrom the dry and brittle wishbone.\n\n“Peg told me how it must be done. I’m to hold the wishbone with both\nhands, like this, and walk backward, repeating the wish nine times. And\nwhen I’ve finished the ninth time I’m to turn around nine times, from\nright to left, and then the wish will come true right away.”\n\n“Do you expect to see Pat when you finish turning?” said Dan\nskeptically.\n\nNone of us had any faith in the incantation except Peter, and, by\ninfection, Cecily. You never could tell what might happen. Cecily\ntook the wishbone in her trembling little hands and began her backward\npacing, repeating solemnly, “I wish that we may find Paddy alive, or\nelse his body, so that we can bury him decently.” By the time Cecily\nhad repeated this nine times we were all slightly infected with the\ndesperate hope that something might come of it; and when she had\nmade her nine gyrations we looked eagerly down the sunset lane, half\nexpecting to see our lost pet. But we saw only the Awkward Man turning\nin at the gate. This was almost as surprising as the sight of Pat\nhimself would have been; but there was no sign of Pat and hope flickered\nout in every breast but Peter’s.\n\n“You’ve got to give the spell time to work,” he expostulated. “If Pat\nwas miles away when it was wished it wouldn’t be reasonable to expect to\nsee him right off.”\n\nBut we of little faith had already lost that little, and it was a very\ndisconsolate group which the Awkward Man presently joined.\n\nHe was smiling--his rare, beautiful smile which only children ever\nsaw--and he lifted his hat to the girls with no trace of the shyness and\nawkwardness for which he was notorious.\n\n“Good evening,” he said. “Have you little people lost a cat lately?”\n\nWe stared. Peter said “I knew it!” in a triumphant pig’s whisper. The\nStory Girl started eagerly forward.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Dale, can you tell us anything of Paddy?” she cried.\n\n“A silver gray cat with black points and very fine marking?”\n\n“Yes, yes!”\n\n“Alive?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, doesn’t that beat the Dutch!” muttered Dan.\n\nBut we were all crowding about the Awkward Man, demanding where and when\nhe had found Paddy.\n\n“You’d better come over to my place and make sure that it really is your\ncat,” suggested the Awkward Man, “and I’ll tell you all about finding\nhim on the way. I must warn you that he is pretty thin--but I think\nhe’ll pull through.”\n\nWe obtained permission to go without much difficulty, although the\nspring evening was wearing late, for Aunt Janet said she supposed none\nof us would sleep a wink that night if we didn’t. A joyful procession\nfollowed the Awkward Man and the Story Girl across the gray, star-litten\nmeadows to his home and through his pine-guarded gate.\n\n“You know that old barn of mine back in the woods?” said the Awkward\nMan. “I go to it only about once in a blue moon. There was an old barrel\nthere, upside down, one side resting on a block of wood. This morning\nI went to the barn to see about having some hay hauled home, and I had\noccasion to move the barrel. I noticed that it seemed to have been\nmoved slightly since my last visit, and it was now resting wholly on the\nfloor. I lifted it up--and there was a cat lying on the floor under it.\nI had heard you had lost yours and I took it this was your pet. I was\nafraid he was dead at first. He was lying there with his eyes closed;\nbut when I bent over him he opened them and gave a pitiful little mew;\nor rather his mouth made the motion of a mew, for he was too weak to\nutter a sound.”\n\n“Oh, poor, poor Paddy,” said tender-hearted Cecily tearfully.\n\n“He couldn’t stand, so I carried him home and gave him just a little\nmilk. Fortunately he was able to lap it. I gave him a little more at\nintervals all day, and when I left he was able to crawl around. I think\nhe’ll be all right, but you’ll have to be careful how you feed him for a\nfew days. Don’t let your hearts run away with your judgment and kill him\nwith kindness.”\n\n“Do you suppose any one put him under that barrel?” asked the Story\nGirl.\n\n“No. The barn was locked. Nothing but a cat could get in. I suppose\nhe went under the barrel, perhaps in pursuit of a mouse, and somehow\nknocked it off the block and so imprisoned himself.”\n\nPaddy was sitting before the fire in the Awkward Man’s clean, bare\nkitchen. Thin! Why, he was literally skin and bone, and his fur was dull\nand lustreless. It almost broke our hearts to see our beautiful Paddy\nbrought so low.\n\n“Oh, how he must have suffered!” moaned Cecily.\n\n“He’ll be as prosperous as ever in a week or two,” said the Awkward Man\nkindly.\n\nThe Story Girl gathered Paddy up in her arms. Most mellifluously did he\npurr as we crowded around to stroke him; with friendly joy he licked our\nhands with his little red tongue; poor Paddy was a thankful cat; he was\nno longer lost, starving, imprisoned, helpless; he was with his comrades\nonce more and he was going home--home to his old familiar haunts of\norchard and dairy and granary, to his daily rations of new milk and\ncream, to the cosy corner of his own fireside. We trooped home joyfully,\nthe Story Girl in our midst carrying Paddy hugged against her shoulder.\nNever did April stars look down on a happier band of travellers on the\ngolden road. There was a little gray wind out in the meadows that\nnight, and it danced along beside us on viewless, fairy feet, and sang\na delicate song of the lovely, waiting years, while the night laid her\nbeautiful hands of blessing over the world.\n\n“You see what Peg’s wishbone did,” said Peter triumphantly.\n\n“Now, look here, Peter, don’t talk nonsense,” expostulated Dan. “The\nAwkward Man found Paddy this morning and had started to bring us word\nbefore Cecily ever thought of the wishbone. Do you mean to say you\nbelieve he wouldn’t have come walking up our lane just when he did if\nshe had never thought of it?”\n\n“I mean to say that I wouldn’t mind if I had several wishbones of the\nsame kind,” retorted Peter stubbornly.\n\n“Of course I don’t think the wishbone had really anything to do with\nour getting Paddy back, but I’m glad I tried it, for all that,” remarked\nCecily in a tone of satisfaction.\n\n“Well, anyhow, we’ve got Pat and that’s the main thing,” said Felix.\n\n“And I hope it will be a lesson to him to stay home after this,”\n commented Felicity.\n\n“They say the barrens are full of mayflowers,” said the Story Girl. “Let\nus have a mayflower picnic tomorrow to celebrate Paddy’s safe return.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. FLOWERS O’ MAY\n\n\nAccordingly we went a-maying, following the lure of dancing winds to a\ncertain westward sloping hill lying under the spirit-like blue of spring\nskies, feathered over with lisping young pines and firs, which cupped\nlittle hollows and corners where the sunshine got in and never got out\nagain, but stayed there and grew mellow, coaxing dear things to bloom\nlong before they would dream of waking up elsewhere.\n\n‘Twas there we found our mayflowers, after faithful seeking. Mayflowers,\nyou must know, never flaunt themselves; they must be sought as\nbecomes them, and then they will yield up their treasures to the\nseeker--clusters of star-white and dawn-pink that have in them the very\nsoul of all the springs that ever were, re-incarnated in something it\nseems gross to call perfume, so exquisite and spiritual is it.\n\nWe wandered gaily over the hill, calling to each other with laughter\nand jest, getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless\nwilderness, and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and\nsunny silences, where the wind purred and gentled and went softly. When\nthe sun began to hang low, sending great fan-like streamers of radiance\nup to the zenith, we foregathered in a tiny, sequestered valley, full\nof young green fern, lying in the shadow of a wooded hill. In it was a\nshallow pool--a glimmering green sheet of water on whose banks nymphs\nmight dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in Cretan\ndale. There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems from our\nspoil, making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our baskets with\nsweetness. The Story Girl twisted a spray of divinest pink in her brown\ncurls, and told us an old legend of a beautiful Indian maiden who died\nof a broken heart when the first snows of winter were falling, because\nshe believed her long-absent lover was false. But he came back in the\nspring time from his long captivity; and when he heard that she was dead\nhe sought her grave to mourn her, and lo, under the dead leaves of the\nold year he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before, and\nknew that it was a message of love and remembrance from his dark-eyed\nsweet-heart.\n\n“Except in stories Indian girls are called squaws,” remarked practical\nDan, tying his mayflowers together in one huge, solid, cabbage-like\nbunch. Not for Dan the bother of filling his basket with the loose\nsprays, mingled with feathery elephant’s-ears and trails of creeping\nspruce, as the rest of us, following the Story Girl’s example, did. Nor\nwould he admit that ours looked any better than his.\n\n“I like things of one kind together. I don’t like them mixed,” he said.\n\n“You have no taste,” said Felicity.\n\n“Except in my mouth, best beloved,” responded Dan.\n\n“You do think you are so smart,” retorted Felicity, flushing with anger.\n\n“Don’t quarrel this lovely day,” implored Cecily.\n\n“Nobody’s quarrelling, Sis. I ain’t a bit mad. It’s Felicity. What on\nearth is that at the bottom of your basket, Cecily?”\n\n“It’s a History of the Reformation in France,” confessed poor Cecily,\n“by a man named D-a-u-b-i-g-n-y. I can’t pronounce it. I heard Mr.\nMarwood saying it was a book everyone ought to read, so I began it\nlast Sunday. I brought it along today to read when I got tired picking\nflowers. I’d ever so much rather have brought Ester Reid. There’s so\nmuch in the history I can’t understand, and it is so dreadful to read of\npeople being burned to death. But I felt I OUGHT to read it.”\n\n“Do you really think your mind has improved any?” asked Sara Ray\nseriously, wreathing the handle of her basket with creeping spruce.\n\n“No, I’m afraid it hasn’t one bit,” answered Cecily sadly. “I feel that\nI haven’t succeeded very well in keeping my resolutions.”\n\n“I’ve kept mine,” said Felicity complacently.\n\n“It’s easy to keep just one,” retorted Cecily, rather resentfully.\n\n“It’s not so easy to think beautiful thoughts,” answered Felicity.\n\n“It’s the easiest thing in the world,” said the Story Girl, tiptoeing to\nthe edge of the pool to peep at her own arch reflection, as some nymph\nleft over from the golden age might do. “Beautiful thoughts just crowd\ninto your mind at times.”\n\n“Oh, yes, AT TIMES. But that’s different from thinking one REGULARLY at\na given hour. And mother is always calling up the stairs for me to hurry\nup and get dressed, and it’s VERY hard sometimes.”\n\n“That’s so,” conceded the Story Girl. “There ARE times when I can’t\nthink anything but gray thoughts. Then, other days, I think pink and\nblue and gold and purple and rainbow thoughts all the time.”\n\n“The idea! As if thoughts were coloured,” giggled Felicity.\n\n“Oh, they are!” cried the Story Girl. “Why, I can always SEE the colour\nof any thought I think. Can’t you?”\n\n“I never heard of such a thing,” declared Felicity, “and I don’t believe\nit. I believe you are just making that up.”\n\n“Indeed I’m not. Why, I always supposed everyone thought in colours. It\nmust be very tiresome if you don’t.”\n\n“When you think of me what colour is it?” asked Peter curiously.\n\n“Yellow,” answered the Story Girl promptly. “And Cecily is a sweet pink,\nlike those mayflowers, and Sara Ray is very pale blue, and Dan is red\nand Felix is yellow, like Peter, and Bev is striped.”\n\n“What colour am I?” asked Felicity, amid the laughter at my expense.\n\n“You’re--you’re like a rainbow,” answered the Story Girl rather\nreluctantly. She had to be honest, but she would rather not have\ncomplimented Felicity. “And you needn’t laugh at Bev. His stripes are\nbeautiful. It isn’t HE that is striped. It’s just the THOUGHT of him.\nPeg Bowen is a queer sort of yellowish green and the Awkward Man is\nlilac. Aunt Olivia is pansy-purple mixed with gold, and Uncle Roger is\nnavy blue.”\n\n“I never heard such nonsense,” declared Felicity. The rest of us were\nrather inclined to agree with her for once. We thought the Story Girl\nwas making fun of us. But I believe she really had a strange gift of\nthinking in colours. In later years, when we were grown up, she told\nme of it again. She said that everything had colour in her thought; the\nmonths of the year ran through all the tints of the spectrum, the days\nof the week were arrayed as Solomon in his glory, morning was golden,\nnoon orange, evening crystal blue, and night violet. Every idea came to\nher mind robed in its own especial hue. Perhaps that was why her voice\nand words had such a charm, conveying to the listeners’ perception such\nfine shadings of meaning and tint and music.\n\n“Well, let’s go and have something to eat,” suggested Dan. “What colour\nis eating, Sara?”\n\n“Golden brown, just the colour of a molasses cooky,” laughed the Story\nGirl.\n\nWe sat on the ferny bank of the pool and ate of the generous basket Aunt\nJanet had provided, with appetites sharpened by the keen spring air and\nour wilderness rovings. Felicity had made some very nice sandwiches of\nham which we all appreciated except Dan, who declared he didn’t like\nthings minced up and dug out of the basket a chunk of boiled pork which\nhe proceeded to saw up with a jack-knife and devour with gusto.\n\n“I told ma to put this in for me. There’s some CHEW to it,” he said.\n\n“You are not a bit refined,” commented Felicity.\n\n“Not a morsel, my love,” grinned Dan.\n\n“You make me think of a story I heard Uncle Roger telling about Cousin\nAnnetta King,” said the Story Girl. “Great-uncle Jeremiah King used to\nlive where Uncle Roger lives now, when Grandfather King was alive and\nUncle Roger was a boy. In those days it was thought rather coarse for a\nyoung lady to have too hearty an appetite, and she was more admired if\nshe was delicate about what she ate. Cousin Annetta set out to be very\nrefined indeed. She pretended to have no appetite at all. One afternoon\nshe was invited to tea at Grandfather King’s when they had some special\ncompany--people from Charlottetown. Cousin Annetta said she could hardly\neat anything. ‘You know, Uncle Abraham,’ she said, in a very affected,\nfine-young-lady voice, ‘I really hardly eat enough to keep a bird alive.\nMother says she wonders how I continue to exist.’ And she picked and\npecked until Grandfather King declared he would like to throw something\nat her. After tea Cousin Annetta went home, and just about dark\nGrandfather King went over to Uncle Jeremiah’s on an errand. As he\npassed the open, lighted pantry window he happened to glance in, and\nwhat do you think he saw? Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the\ndresser, with a big loaf of bread beside her and a big platterful of\ncold, boiled pork in front of her; and Annetta was hacking off great\nchunks, like Dan there, and gobbling them down as if she was starving.\nGrandfather King couldn’t resist the temptation. He stepped up to the\nwindow and said, ‘I’m glad your appetite has come back to you, Annetta.\nYour mother needn’t worry about your continuing to exist as long as you\ncan tuck away fat, salt pork in that fashion.’\n\n“Cousin Annetta never forgave him, but she never pretended to be\ndelicate again.”\n\n“The Jews don’t believe in eating pork,” said Peter.\n\n“I’m glad I’m not a Jew and I guess Cousin Annetta was too,” said Dan.\n\n“I like bacon, but I can never look at a pig without wondering if they\nwere ever intended to be eaten,” remarked Cecily naively.\n\nWhen we finished our lunch the barrens were already wrapping themselves\nin a dim, blue dusk and falling upon rest in dell and dingle. But out\nin the open there was still much light of a fine emerald-golden sort and\nthe robins whistled us home in it. “Horns of Elfland” never sounded more\nsweetly around hoary castle and ruined fane than those vesper calls\nof the robins from the twilight spruce woods and across green pastures\nlying under the pale radiance of a young moon.\n\nWhen we reached home we found that Miss Reade had been up to the hill\nfarm on an errand and was just leaving. The Story Girl went for a walk\nwith her and came back with an important expression on her face.\n\n“You look as if you had a story to tell,” said Felix.\n\n“One is growing. It isn’t a whole story yet,” answered the Story Girl\nmysteriously.\n\n“What is it?” asked Cecily.\n\n“I can’t tell you till it’s fully grown,” said the Story Girl. “But\nI’ll tell you a pretty little story the Awkward Man told us--told\nme--tonight. He was walking in his garden as we went by, looking at his\ntulip beds. His tulips are up ever so much higher than ours, and I asked\nhim how he managed to coax them along so early. And he said HE didn’t do\nit--it was all the work of the pixies who lived in the woods across\nthe brook. There were more pixy babies than usual this spring, and the\nmothers were in a hurry for the cradles. The tulips are the pixy babies’\ncradles, it seems. The mother pixies come out of the woods at twilight\nand rock their tiny little brown babies to sleep in the tulip cups. That\nis the reason why tulip blooms last so much longer than other blossoms.\nThe pixy babies must have a cradle until they are grown up. They grow\nvery fast, you see, and the Awkward Man says on a spring evening, when\nthe tulips are out, you can hear the sweetest, softest, clearest, fairy\nmusic in his garden, and it is the pixy folk singing as they rock the\npixy babies to sleep.”\n\n“Then the Awkward Man says what isn’t true,” said Felicity severely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A SURPRISING ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n\n“Nothing exciting has happened for ever so long,” said the Story Girl\ndiscontentedly, one late May evening, as we lingered under the wonderful\nwhite bloom of the cherry trees. There was a long row of them in the\norchard, with a Lombardy poplar at either end, and a hedge of lilacs\nbehind. When the wind blew over them all the spicy breezes of Ceylon’s\nisle were never sweeter.\n\nIt was a time of wonder and marvel, of the soft touch of silver rain on\ngreening fields, of the incredible delicacy of young leaves, of blossom\nin field and garden and wood. The whole world bloomed in a flush and\ntremor of maiden loveliness, instinct with all the evasive, fleeting\ncharm of spring and girlhood and young morning. We felt and enjoyed it\nall without understanding or analyzing it. It was enough to be glad and\nyoung with spring on the golden road.\n\n“I don’t like excitement very much,” said Cecily. “It makes one so\ntired. I’m sure it was exciting enough when Paddy was missing, but we\ndidn’t find that very pleasant.”\n\n“No, but it was interesting,” returned the Story Girl thoughtfully.\n“After all, I believe I’d rather be miserable than dull.”\n\n“I wouldn’t then,” said Felicity decidedly. “And you need never be dull\nwhen you have work to do. ‘Satan finds some mischief still for idle\nhands to do!’”\n\n“Well, mischief is interesting,” laughed the Story Girl. “And I thought\nyou didn’t think it lady-like to speak of that person, Felicity?”\n\n“It’s all right if you call him by his polite name,” said Felicity\nstiffly.\n\n“Why does the Lombardy poplar hold its branches straight up in the\nair like that, when all the other poplars hold theirs out or hang them\ndown?” interjected Peter, who had been gazing intently at the slender\nspire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky.\n\n“Because it grows that way,” said Felicity.\n\n“Oh I know a story about that,” cried the Story Girl. “Once upon a time\nan old man found the pot of gold at the rainbow’s end. There IS a pot\nthere, it is said, but it is very hard to find because you can never get\nto the rainbow’s end before it vanishes from your sight. But this old\nman found it, just at sunset, when Iris, the guardian of the rainbow\ngold, happened to be absent. As he was a long way from home, and the pot\nwas very big and heavy, he decided to hide it until morning and then get\none of his sons to go with him and help him carry it. So he hid it under\nthe boughs of the sleeping poplar tree.\n\n“When Iris came back she missed the pot of gold and of course she was in\na sad way about it. She sent Mercury, the messenger of the gods, to\nlook for it, for she didn’t dare leave the rainbow again, lest somebody\nshould run off with that too. Mercury asked all the trees if they had\nseen the pot of gold, and the elm, oak and pine pointed to the poplar\nand said,\n\n“‘The poplar can tell you where it is.’\n\n“‘How can I tell you where it is?’ cried the poplar, and she held up all\nher branches in surprise, just as we hold up our hands--and down tumbled\nthe pot of gold. The poplar was amazed and indignant, for she was a very\nhonest tree. She stretched her boughs high above her head and declared\nthat she would always hold them like that, so that nobody could hide\nstolen gold under them again. And she taught all the little poplars she\nknew to stand the same way, and that is why Lombardy poplars always do.\nBut the aspen poplar leaves are always shaking, even on the very calmest\nday. And do you know why?”\n\nAnd then she told us the old legend that the cross on which the Saviour\nof the world suffered was made of aspen poplar wood and so never again\ncould its poor, shaken, shivering leaves know rest or peace. There was\nan aspen in the orchard, the very embodiment of youth and spring in its\nlitheness and symmetry. Its little leaves were hanging tremulously, not\nyet so fully blown as to hide its development of bough and twig, making\npoetry against the spiritual tints of a spring sunset.\n\n“It does look sad,” said Peter, “but it is a pretty tree, and it wasn’t\nits fault.”\n\n“There’s a heavy dew and it’s time we stopped talking nonsense and went\nin,” decreed Felicity. “If we don’t we’ll all have a cold, and then\nwe’ll be miserable enough, but it won’t be very exciting.”\n\n“All the same, I wish something exciting would happen,” finished the\nStory Girl, as we walked up through the orchard, peopled with its\nnun-like shadows.\n\n“There’s a new moon tonight, so may be you’ll get your wish,” said\nPeter. “My Aunt Jane didn’t believe there was anything in the moon\nbusiness, but you never can tell.”\n\nThe Story Girl did get her wish. Something happened the very next day.\nShe joined us in the afternoon with a quite indescribable expression\non her face, compounded of triumph, anticipation, and regret. Her\neyes betrayed that she had been crying, but in them shone a chastened\nexultation. Whatever the Story Girl mourned over it was evident she was\nnot without hope.\n\n“I have some news to tell you,” she said importantly. “Can you guess\nwhat it is?”\n\nWe couldn’t and wouldn’t try.\n\n“Tell us right off,” implored Felix. “You look as if it was something\ntremendous.”\n\n“So it is. Listen--Aunt Olivia is going to be married.”\n\nWe stared in blank amazement. Peg Bowen’s hint had faded from our minds\nand we had never put much faith in it.\n\n“Aunt Olivia! I don’t believe it,” cried Felicity flatly. “Who told\nyou?”\n\n“Aunt Olivia herself. So it is perfectly true. I’m awfully sorry in one\nway--but oh, won’t it be splendid to have a real wedding in the family?\nShe’s going to have a big wedding--and I am to be bridesmaid.”\n\n“I shouldn’t think you were old enough to be a bridesmaid,” said\nFelicity sharply.\n\n“I’m nearly fifteen. Anyway, Aunt Olivia says I have to be.”\n\n“Who’s she going to marry?” asked Cecily, gathering herself together\nafter the shock, and finding that the world was going on just the same.\n\n“His name is Dr. Seton and he is a Halifax man. She met him when she\nwas at Uncle Edward’s last summer. They’ve been engaged ever since. The\nwedding is to be the third week in June.”\n\n“And our school concert comes off the next week,” complained Felicity.\n“Why do things always come together like that? And what are you going to\ndo if Aunt Olivia is going away?”\n\n“I’m coming to live at your house,” answered the Story Girl rather\ntimidly. She did not know how Felicity might like that. But Felicity\ntook it rather well.\n\n“You’ve been here most of the time anyhow, so it’ll just be that you’ll\nsleep and eat here, too. But what’s to become of Uncle Roger?”\n\n“Aunt Olivia says he’ll have to get married, too. But Uncle Roger says\nhe’d rather hire a housekeeper than marry one, because in the first case\nhe could turn her off if he didn’t like her, but in the second case he\ncouldn’t.”\n\n“There’ll be a lot of cooking to do for the wedding,” reflected Felicity\nin a tone of satisfaction.\n\n“I s’pose Aunt Olivia will want some rusks made. I hope she has plenty\nof tooth-powder laid in,” said Dan.\n\n“It’s a pity you don’t use some of that tooth-powder you’re so fond of\ntalking about yourself,” retorted Felicity. “When anyone has a mouth the\nsize of yours the teeth show so plain.”\n\n“I brush my teeth every Sunday,” asseverated Dan.\n\n“Every Sunday! You ought to brush them every DAY.”\n\n“Did anyone ever hear such nonsense?” demanded Dan sincerely.\n\n“Well, you know, it really does say so in the Family Guide,” said Cecily\nquietly.\n\n“Then the Family Guide people must have lots more spare time than I\nhave,” retorted Dan contemptuously.\n\n“Just think, the Story Girl will have her name in the papers if she’s\nbridesmaid,” marvelled Sara Ray.\n\n“In the Halifax papers, too,” added Felix, “since Dr. Seton is a Halifax\nman. What is his first name?”\n\n“Robert.”\n\n“And will we have to call him Uncle Robert?”\n\n“Not until he’s married to her. Then we will, of course.”\n\n“I hope your Aunt Olivia won’t disappear before the ceremony,” remarked\nSara Ray, who was surreptitiously reading “The Vanquished Bride,” by\nValeria H. Montague in the Family Guide.\n\n“I hope Dr. Seton won’t fail to show up, like your cousin Rachel Ward’s\nbeau,” said Peter.\n\n“That makes me think of another story I read the other day about\nGreat-uncle Andrew King and Aunt Georgina,” laughed the Story Girl. “It\nhappened eighty years ago. It was a very stormy winter and the roads\nwere bad. Uncle Andrew lived in Carlisle, and Aunt Georgina--she was\nMiss Georgina Matheson then--lived away up west, so he couldn’t get to\nsee her very often. They agreed to be married that winter, but Georgina\ncouldn’t set the day exactly because her brother, who lived in Ontario,\nwas coming home for a visit, and she wanted to be married while he was\nhome. So it was arranged that she was to write Uncle Andrew and tell him\nwhat day to come. She did, and she told him to come on a Tuesday. But\nher writing wasn’t very good and poor Uncle Andrew thought she wrote\nThursday. So on Thursday he drove all the way to Georgina’s home to be\nmarried. It was forty miles and a bitter cold day. But it wasn’t any\ncolder than the reception he got from Georgina. She was out in the\nporch, with her head tied up in a towel, picking geese. She had been\nall ready Tuesday, and her friends and the minister were there, and the\nwedding supper prepared. But there was no bridegroom and Georgina was\nfurious. Nothing Uncle Andrew could say would appease her. She wouldn’t\nlisten to a word of explanation, but told him to go, and never show his\nnose there again. So poor Uncle Andrew had to go ruefully home, hoping\nthat she would relent later on, because he was really very much in love\nwith her.”\n\n“And did she?” queried Felicity.\n\n“She did. Thirteen years exactly from that day they were married. It\ntook her just that long to forgive him.”\n\n“It took her just that long to find out she couldn’t get anybody else,”\n said Dan, cynically.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. A PRODIGAL RETURNS\n\n\nAunt Olivia and the Story Girl lived in a whirlwind of dressmaking after\nthat, and enjoyed it hugely. Cecily and Felicity also had to have\nnew dresses for the great event, and they talked of little else for a\nfortnight. Cecily declared that she hated to go to sleep because she\nwas sure to dream that she was at Aunt Olivia’s wedding in her old faded\ngingham dress and a ragged apron.\n\n“And no shoes or stockings,” she added, “and I can’t move, and everyone\nwalks past and looks at my feet.”\n\n“That’s only in a dream,” mourned Sara Ray, “but I may have to wear my\nlast summer’s white dress to the wedding. It’s too short, but ma says\nit’s plenty good for this summer. I’ll be so mortified if I have to wear\nit.”\n\n“I’d rather not go at all than wear a dress that wasn’t nice,” said\nFelicity pleasantly.\n\n“I’d go to the wedding if I had to go in my school dress,” cried Sara\nRay. “I’ve never been to anything. I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”\n\n“My Aunt Jane always said that if you were neat and tidy it didn’t\nmatter whether you were dressed fine or not,” said Peter.\n\n“I’m sick and tired of hearing about your Aunt Jane,” said Felicity\ncrossly.\n\nPeter looked grieved but held his peace. Felicity was very hard on him\nthat spring, but his loyalty never wavered. Everything she said or did\nwas right in Peter’s eyes.\n\n“It’s all very well to be neat and tidy,” said Sara Ray, “but I like a\nlittle style too.”\n\n“I think you’ll find your mother will get you a new dress after all,”\n comforted Cecily. “Anyway, nobody will notice you because everyone will\nbe looking at the bride. Aunt Olivia will make a lovely bride. Just\nthink how sweet she’ll look in a white silk dress and a floating veil.”\n\n“She says she is going to have the ceremony performed out here in\nthe orchard under her own tree,” said the Story Girl. “Won’t that be\nromantic? It almost makes me feel like getting married myself.”\n\n“What a way to talk,” rebuked Felicity, “and you only fifteen.”\n\n“Lots of people have been married at fifteen,” laughed the Story Girl.\n“Lady Jane Gray was.”\n\n“But you are always saying that Valeria H. Montague’s stories are silly\nand not true to life, so that is no argument,” retorted Felicity, who\nknew more about cooking than about history, and evidently imagined that\nthe Lady Jane Gray was one of Valeria’s titled heroines.\n\nThe wedding was a perennial source of conversation among us in those\ndays; but presently its interest palled for a time in the light of\nanother quite tremendous happening. One Saturday night Peter’s mother\ncalled to take him home with her for Sunday. She had been working at Mr.\nJames Frewen’s, and Mr. Frewen was driving her home. We had never seen\nPeter’s mother before, and we looked at her with discreet curiosity. She\nwas a plump, black-eyed little woman, neat as a pin, but with a rather\ntired and care-worn face that looked as if it should have been rosy and\njolly. Life had been a hard battle for her, and I rather think that her\ncurly-headed little lad was all that had kept heart and spirit in her.\nPeter went home with her and returned Sunday evening. We were in the\norchard sitting around the Pulpit Stone, where we had, according to the\ncustom of the households of King, been learning our golden texts and\nmemory verses for the next Sunday School lesson. Paddy, grown sleek and\nhandsome again, was sitting on the stone itself, washing his jowls.\n\nPeter joined us with a very queer expression on his face. He seemed\nbursting with some news which he wanted to tell and yet hardly liked to.\n\n“Why are you looking so mysterious, Peter?” demanded the Story Girl.\n\n“What do you think has happened?” asked Peter solemnly.\n\n“What has?”\n\n“My father has come home,” answered Peter.\n\nThe announcement produced all the sensation he could have wished. We\ncrowded around him in excitement.\n\n“Peter! When did he come back?”\n\n“Saturday night. He was there when ma and I got home. It give her an\nawful turn. I didn’t know him at first, of course.”\n\n“Peter Craig, I believe you are glad your father has come back,” cried\nthe Story Girl.\n\n“‘Course I’m glad,” retorted Peter.\n\n“And after you saying you didn’t want ever to see him again,” said\nFelicity.\n\n“You just wait. You haven’t heard my story yet. I wouldn’t have been\nglad to see father if he’d come back the same as he went away. But he is\na changed man. He happened to go into a revival meeting one night this\nspring and he got converted. And he’s come home to stay, and he says\nhe’s never going to drink another drop, but he’s going to look after his\nfamily. Ma isn’t to do any more washing for nobody but him and me, and\nI’m not to be a hired boy any longer. He says I can stay with your Uncle\nRoger till the fall ‘cause I promised I would, but after that I’m to\nstay home and go to school right along and learn to be whatever I’d like\nto be. I tell you it made me feel queer. Everything seemed to be upset.\nBut he gave ma forty dollars--every cent he had--so I guess he really is\nconverted.”\n\n“I hope it will last, I’m sure,” said Felicity. She did not say it\nnastily, however. We were all glad for Peter’s sake, though a little\ndizzy over the unexpectedness of it all.\n\n“This is what I’D like to know,” said Peter. “How did Peg Bowen know my\nfather was coming home? Don’t you tell me she isn’t a witch after that.”\n\n“And she knew about your Aunt Olivia’s wedding, too,” added Sara Ray.\n\n“Oh, well, she likely heard that from some one. Grown up folks talk\nthings over long before they tell them to children,” said Cecily.\n\n“Well, she couldn’t have heard father was coming home from any one,”\n answered Peter. “He was converted up in Maine, where nobody knew him,\nand he never told a soul he was coming till he got here. No, you can\nbelieve what you like, but I’m satisfied at last that Peg is a witch and\nthat skull of hers does tell her things. She told me father was coming\nhome and he come!”\n\n“How happy you must be,” sighed Sara Ray romantically. “It’s just like\nthat story in the Family Guide, where the missing earl comes home to his\nfamily just as the Countess and Lady Violetta are going to be turned out\nby the cruel heir.”\n\nFelicity sniffed.\n\n“There’s some difference, I guess. The earl had been imprisoned for\nyears in a loathsome dungeon.”\n\nPerhaps Peter’s father had too, if we but realized it--imprisoned in the\ndungeon of his own evil appetites and habits, than which none could\nbe more loathsome. But a Power, mightier than the forces of evil, had\nstruck off his fetters and led him back to his long-forfeited liberty\nand light. And no countess or lady of high degree could have welcomed a\nlong-lost earl home more joyfully than the tired little washerwoman had\nwelcomed the erring husband of her youth.\n\nBut in Peter’s ointment of joy there was a fly or two. So very, very few\nthings are flawless in this world, even on the golden road.\n\n“Of course I’m awful glad that father has come back and that ma won’t\nhave to wash any more,” he said with a sigh, “but there are two things\nthat kind of worry me. My Aunt Jane always said that it didn’t do any\ngood to worry, and I s’pose it don’t, but it’s kind of a relief.”\n\n“What’s worrying you?” asked Felix.\n\n“Well, for one thing I’ll feel awful bad to go away from you all. I’ll\nmiss you just dreadful, and I won’t even be able to go to the same\nschool. I’ll have to go to Markdale school.”\n\n“But you must come and see us often,” said Felicity graciously.\n“Markdale isn’t so far away, and you could spend every other Saturday\nafternoon with us anyway.”\n\nPeter’s black eyes filled with adoring gratitude.\n\n“That’s so kind of you, Felicity. I’ll come as often as I can, of\ncourse; but it won’t be the same as being around with you all the time.\nThe other thing is even worse. You see, it was a Methodist revival\nfather got converted in, and so of course he joined the Methodist\nchurch. He wasn’t anything before. He used to say he was a Nothingarian\nand lived up to it--kind of bragging like. But he’s a strong Methodist\nnow, and is going to go to Markdale Methodist church and pay to the\nsalary. Now what’ll he say when I tell him I’m a Presbyterian?”\n\n“You haven’t told him, yet?” asked the Story Girl.\n\n“No, I didn’t dare. I was scared he’d say I’d have to be a Methodist.”\n\n“Well, Methodists are pretty near as good as Presbyterians,” said\nFelicity, with the air of one making a great concession.\n\n“I guess they’re every bit as good,” retorted Peter. “But that ain’t the\npoint. I’ve got to be a Presbyterian, ‘cause I stick to a thing when I\nonce decide it. But I expect father will be mad when he finds out.”\n\n“If he’s converted he oughtn’t to get mad,” said Dan.\n\n“Well, lots o’ people do. But if he isn’t mad he’ll be sorry, and\nthat’ll be even worse, for a Presbyterian I’m bound to be. But I expect\nit will make things unpleasant.”\n\n“You needn’t tell him anything about it,” advised Felicity. “Just keep\nquiet and go to the Methodist church until you get big, and then you can\ngo where you please.”\n\n“No, that wouldn’t be honest,” said Peter sturdily. “My Aunt Jane\nalways said it was best to be open and above board in everything, and\nespecially in religion. So I’ll tell father right out, but I’ll wait a\nfew weeks so as not to spoil things for ma too soon if he acts up.”\n\nPeter was not the only one who had secret cares. Sara Ray was beginning\nto feel worried over her looks. I heard her and Cecily talking over\ntheir troubles one evening while I was weeding the onion bed and they\nwere behind the hedge knitting lace. I did not mean to eavesdrop.\nI supposed they knew I was there until Cecily overwhelmed me with\nindignation later on.\n\n“I’m so afraid, Cecily, that I’m going to be homely all my life,” said\npoor Sara with a tremble in her voice. “You can stand being ugly when\nyou are young if you have any hope of being better looking when you grow\nup. But I’m getting worse. Aunt Mary says I’m going to be the very\nimage of Aunt Matilda. And Aunt Matilda is as homely as she can be. It\nisn’t”--and poor Sara sighed--“a very cheerful prospect. If I am ugly\nnobody will ever want to marry me, and,” concluded Sara candidly, “I\ndon’t want to be an old maid.”\n\n“But plenty of girls get married who aren’t a bit pretty,” comforted\nCecily. “Besides, you are real nice looking at times, Sara. I think you\nare going to have a nice figure.”\n\n“But just look at my hands,” moaned Sara. “They’re simply covered with\nwarts.”\n\n“Oh, the warts will all disappear before you grow up,” said Cecily.\n\n“But they won’t disappear before the school concert. How am I to get\nup there and recite? You know there is one line in my recitation, ‘She\nwaved her lily-white hand,’ and I have to wave mine when I say it. Fancy\nwaving a lily-white hand all covered with warts. I’ve tried every remedy\nI ever heard of, but nothing does any good. Judy Pineau said if I rubbed\nthem with toad-spit it would take them away for sure. But how am I to\nget any toad-spit?”\n\n“It doesn’t sound like a very nice remedy, anyhow,” shuddered Cecily.\n“I’d rather have the warts. But do you know, I believe if you didn’t cry\nso much over every little thing, you’d be ever so much better looking.\nCrying spoils your eyes and makes the end of your nose red.”\n\n“I can’t help crying,” protested Sara. “My feelings are so very\nsensitive. I’ve given up trying to keep THAT resolution.”\n\n“Well, men don’t like cry-babies,” said Cecily sagely. Cecily had a good\ndeal of Mother Eve’s wisdom tucked away in that smooth, brown head of\nhers.\n\n“Cecily, do you ever intend to be married?” asked Sara in a confidential\ntone.\n\n“Goodness!” cried Cecily, quite shocked. “It will be time enough when I\ngrow up to think of that, Sara.”\n\n“I should think you’d have to think of it now, with Cyrus Brisk as crazy\nafter you as he is.”\n\n“I wish Cyrus Brisk was at the bottom of the Red Sea,” exclaimed Cecily,\ngoaded into a spurt of temper by mention of the detested name.\n\n“What has Cyrus been doing now?” asked Felicity, coming around the\ncorner of the hedge.\n\n“Doing NOW! It’s ALL the time. He just worries me to death,” returned\nCecily angrily. “He keeps writing me letters and putting them in my desk\nor in my reader. I never answer one of them, but he keeps on. And in the\nlast one, mind you, he said he’d do something desperate right off if I\nwouldn’t promise to marry him when we grew up.”\n\n“Just think, Cecily, you’ve had a proposal already,” said Sara Ray in an\nawe-struck tone.\n\n“But he hasn’t done anything desperate yet, and that was last week,”\n commented Felicity, with a toss of her head.\n\n“He sent me a lock of his hair and wanted one of mine in exchange,”\n continued Cecily indignantly. “I tell you I sent his back to him pretty\nquick.”\n\n“Did you never answer any of his letters?” asked Sara Ray.\n\n“No, indeed! I guess not!”\n\n“Do you know,” said Felicity, “I believe if you wrote him just once and\ntold him your exact opinion of him in good plain English it would cure\nhim of his nonsense.”\n\n“I couldn’t do that. I haven’t enough spunk,” confessed Cecily with a\nblush. “But I’ll tell you what I did do once. He wrote me a long letter\nlast week. It was just awfully SOFT, and every other word was spelled\nwrong. He even spelled baking soda, ‘bacon soda!’”\n\n“What on earth had he to say about baking soda in a love-letter?” asked\nFelicity.\n\n“Oh, he said his mother sent him to the store for some and he forgot it\nbecause he was thinking about me. Well, I just took his letter and wrote\nin all the words, spelled right, above the wrong ones, in red ink, just\nas Mr. Perkins makes us do with our dictation exercises, and sent it\nback to him. I thought maybe he’d feel insulted and stop writing to me.”\n\n“And did he?”\n\n“No, he didn’t. It is my opinion you can’t insult Cyrus Brisk. He is too\nthick-skinned. He wrote another letter, and thanked me for correcting\nhis mistakes, and said it made him feel glad because it showed I was\nbeginning to take an interest in him when I wanted him to spell better.\nDid you ever? Miss Marwood says it is wrong to hate anyone, but I don’t\ncare, I hate Cyrus Brisk.”\n\n“Mrs. Cyrus Brisk WOULD be an awful name,” giggled Felicity.\n\n“Flossie Brisk says Cyrus is ruining all the trees on his father’s place\ncutting your name on them,” said Sara Ray. “His father told him he would\nwhip him if he didn’t stop, but Cyrus keeps right on. He told Flossie it\nrelieved his feelings. Flossie says he cut yours and his together on the\nbirch tree in front of the parlour window, and a row of hearts around\nthem.”\n\n“Just where every visitor can see them, I suppose,” lamented Cecily. “He\njust worries my life out. And what I mind most of all is, he sits and\nlooks at me in school with such melancholy, reproachful eyes when he\nought to be working sums. I won’t look at him, but I FEEL him staring at\nme, and it makes me so nervous.”\n\n“They say his mother was out of her mind at one time,” said Felicity.\n\nI do not think Felicity was quite well pleased that Cyrus should have\npassed over her rose-red prettiness to set his affections on that demure\nelf of a Cecily. She did not want the allegiance of Cyrus in the least,\nbut it was something of a slight that he had not wanted her to want it.\n\n“And he sends me pieces of poetry he cuts out of the papers,” Cecily\nwent on, “with lots of the lines marked with a lead pencil. Yesterday he\nput one in his letter, and this is what he marked:\n\n\n    “‘If you will not relent to me\n     Then must I learn to know\n     Darkness alone till life be flown.\n\nHere--I have the piece in my sewing-bag--I’ll read it all to you.”\n\nThose three graceless girls read the sentimental rhyme and giggled over\nit. Poor Cyrus! His young affections were sadly misplaced. But after\nall, though Cecily never relented towards him, he did not condemn\nhimself to darkness alone till life was flown. Quite early in life he\nwedded a stout, rosy, buxom lass, the very antithesis of his first love;\nhe prospered in his undertakings, raised a large and respectable family,\nand was eventually appointed a Justice of the Peace. Which was all very\nsensible of Cyrus.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE RAPE OF THE LOCK\n\n\nJune was crowded full of interest that year. We gathered in with\nits sheaf of fragrant days the choicest harvest of childhood. Things\nhappened right along. Cecily declared she hated to go to sleep for fear\nshe might miss something. There were so many dear delights along the\ngolden road to give us pleasure--the earth dappled with new blossom,\nthe dance of shadows in the fields, the rustling, rain-wet ways of the\nwoods, the faint fragrance in meadow lanes, liltings of birds and croon\nof bees in the old orchard, windy pipings on the hills, sunset behind\nthe pines, limpid dews filling primrose cups, crescent moons through\ndarklings boughs, soft nights alight with blinking stars. We enjoyed\nall these boons, unthinkingly and light-heartedly, as children do. And\nbesides these, there was the absorbing little drama of human life\nwhich was being enacted all around us, and in which each of us played\na satisfying part--the gay preparations for Aunt Olivia’s mid-June\nwedding, the excitement of practising for the concert with which our\nschool-teacher, Mr. Perkins, had elected to close the school year, and\nCecily’s troubles with Cyrus Brisk, which furnished unholy mirth for the\nrest of us, though Cecily could not see the funny side of it at all.\n\nMatters went from bad to worse in the case of the irrepressible Cyrus.\nHe continued to shower Cecily with notes, the spelling of which showed\nno improvement; he worried the life out of her by constantly threatening\nto fight Willy Fraser--although, as Felicity sarcastically pointed out,\nhe never did it.\n\n“But I’m always afraid he will,” said Cecily, “and it would be such a\nDISGRACE to have two boys fighting over me in school.”\n\n“You must have encouraged Cyrus a little in the beginning or he’d never\nhave been so persevering,” said Felicity unjustly.\n\n“I never did!” cried outraged Cecily. “You know very well, Felicity\nKing, that I hated Cyrus Brisk ever since the very first time I saw his\nbig, fat, red face. So there!”\n\n“Felicity is just jealous because Cyrus didn’t take a notion to her\ninstead of you, Sis,” said Dan.\n\n“Talk sense!” snapped Felicity.\n\n“If I did you wouldn’t understand me, sweet little sister,” rejoined\naggravating Dan.\n\nFinally Cyrus crowned his iniquities by stealing the denied lock of\nCecily’s hair. One sunny afternoon in school, Cecily and Kitty Marr\nasked and received permission to sit out on the side bench before\nthe open window, where the cool breeze swept in from the green fields\nbeyond. To sit on this bench was always considered a treat, and was only\nallowed as a reward of merit; but Cecily and Kitty had another reason\nfor wishing to sit there. Kitty had read in a magazine that sun-baths\nwere good for the hair; so both she and Cecily tossed their long braids\nover the window-sill and let them hang there in the broiling sun-shine.\nAnd while Cecily sat thus, diligently working a fraction sum on her\nslate, that base Cyrus asked permission to go out, having previously\nborrowed a pair of scissors from one of the big girls who did fancy work\nat the noon recess. Outside, Cyrus sneaked up close to the window and\ncut off a piece of Cecily’s hair.\n\nThis rape of the lock did not produce quite such terrible consequences\nas the more famous one in Pope’s poem, but Cecily’s soul was no less\nagitated than Belinda’s. She cried all the way home from school about\nit, and only checked her tears when Dan declared he’d fight Cyrus and\nmake him give it up.\n\n“Oh, no, You mustn’t.” said Cecily, struggling with her sobs. “I won’t\nhave you fighting on my account for anything. And besides, he’d likely\nlick you--he’s so big and rough. And the folks at home might find out\nall about it, and Uncle Roger would never give me any peace, and mother\nwould be cross, for she’d never believe it wasn’t my fault. It wouldn’t\nbe so bad if he’d only taken a little, but he cut a great big chunk\nright off the end of one of the braids. Just look at it. I’ll have to\ncut the other to make them fair--and they’ll look so awful stubby.”\n\nBut Cyrus’ acquirement of the chunk of hair was his last triumph.\nHis downfall was near; and, although it involved Cecily in a most\nhumiliating experience, over which she cried half the following night,\nin the end she confessed it was worth undergoing just to get rid of\nCyrus.\n\nMr. Perkins was an exceedingly strict disciplinarian. No communication\nof any sort was permitted between his pupils during school hours. Anyone\ncaught violating this rule was promptly punished by the infliction of\none of the weird penances for which Mr. Perkins was famous, and which\nwere generally far worse than ordinary whipping.\n\nOne day in school Cyrus sent a letter across to Cecily. Usually he left\nhis effusions in her desk, or between the leaves of her books; but this\ntime it was passed over to her under cover of the desk through the hands\nof two or three scholars. Just as Em Frewen held it over the aisle Mr.\nPerkins wheeled around from his station before the blackboard and caught\nher in the act.\n\n“Bring that here, Emmeline,” he commanded.\n\nCyrus turned quite pale. Em carried the note to Mr. Perkins. He took it,\nheld it up, and scrutinized the address.\n\n“Did you write this to Cecily, Emmeline?” he asked.\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Who wrote it then?”\n\nEm said quite shamelessly that she didn’t know--it had just been passed\nover from the next row.\n\n“And I suppose you have no idea where it came from?” said Mr. Perkins,\nwith his frightful, sardonic grin. “Well, perhaps Cecily can tell us.\nYou may take your seat, Emmeline, and you will remain at the foot of\nyour spelling class for a week as punishment for passing the note.\nCecily, come here.”\n\nIndignant Em sat down and poor, innocent Cecily was haled forth to\npublic ignominy. She went with a crimson face.\n\n“Cecily,” said her tormentor, “do you know who wrote this letter to\nyou?”\n\nCecily, like a certain renowned personage, could not tell a lie.\n\n“I--I think so, sir,” she murmured faintly.\n\n“Who was it?”\n\n“I can’t tell you that,” stammered Cecily, on the verge of tears.\n\n“Ah!” said Mr. Perkins politely. “Well, I suppose I could easily find\nout by opening it. But it is very impolite to open other people’s\nletters. I think I have a better plan. Since you refuse to tell me who\nwrote it, open it yourself, take this chalk, and copy the contents on\nthe blackboard that we may all enjoy them. And sign the writer’s name at\nthe bottom.”\n\n“Oh,” gasped Cecily, choosing the lesser of two evils, “I’ll tell you\nwho wrote it--it was--\n\n“Hush!” Mr. Perkins checked her with a gentle motion of his hand. He\nwas always most gentle when most inexorable. “You did not obey me when\nI first ordered you to tell me the writer. You cannot have the privilege\nof doing so now. Open the note, take the chalk, and do as I command\nyou.”\n\nWorms will turn, and even meek, mild, obedient little souls like Cecily\nmay be goaded to the point of wild, sheer rebellion.\n\n“I--I won’t!” she cried passionately.\n\nMr. Perkins, martinet though he was, would hardly, I think, have\ninflicted such a punishment on Cecily, who was a favourite of his, had\nhe known the real nature of that luckless missive. But, as he afterwards\nadmitted, he thought it was merely a note from some other girl, of such\ntrifling sort as school-girls are wont to write; and moreover, he had\nalready committed himself to the decree, which, like those of Mede and\nPersian, must not alter. To let Cecily off, after her mad defiance,\nwould be to establish a revolutionary precedent.\n\n“So you really think you won’t?” he queried smilingly. “Well, on second\nthoughts, you may take your choice. Either you will do as I have bidden\nyou, or you will sit for three days with”--Mr. Perkins’ eye skimmed over\nthe school-room to find a boy who was sitting alone--“with Cyrus Brisk.”\n\nThis choice of Mr. Perkins, who knew nothing of the little drama of\nemotions that went on under the routine of lessons and exercises in his\ndomain, was purely accidental, but we took it at the time as a stroke of\ndiabolical genius. It left Cecily no choice. She would have done almost\nanything before she would have sat with Cyrus Brisk. With flashing\neyes she tore open the letter, snatched up the chalk, and dashed at the\nblackboard.\n\nIn a few minutes the contents of that letter graced the expanse usually\nsacred to more prosaic compositions. I cannot reproduce it verbatim, for\nI had no after opportunity of refreshing my memory. But I remember that\nit was exceedingly sentimental and exceedingly ill-spelled--for Cecily\nmercilessly copied down poor Cyrus’ mistakes. He wrote her that he wore\nher hare over his hart--“and he stole it,” Cecily threw passionately\nover her shoulder at Mr. Perkins--that her eyes were so sweet and lovely\nthat he couldn’t find words nice enuf to describ them, that he could\nnever forget how butiful she had looked in prar meeting the evening\nbefore, and that some meels he couldn’t eat for thinking of her, with\nmore to the same effect and he signed it “yours till deth us do part,\nCyrus Brisk.”\n\nAs the writing proceeded we scholars exploded into smothered laughter,\ndespite our awe of Mr. Perkins. Mr. Perkins himself could not keep a\nstraight face. He turned abruptly away and looked out of the window,\nbut we could see his shoulders shaking. When Cecily had finished and\nhad thrown down the chalk with bitter vehemence, he turned around with a\nvery red face.\n\n“That will do. You may sit down. Cyrus, since it seems you are the\nguilty person, take the eraser and wipe that off the board. Then go\nstand in the corner, facing the room, and hold your arms straight above\nyour head until I tell you to take them down.”\n\nCyrus obeyed and Cecily fled to her seat and wept, nor did Mr. Perkins\nmeddle with her more that day. She bore her burden of humiliation\nbitterly for several days, until she was suddenly comforted by a\nrealization that Cyrus had ceased to persecute her. He wrote no more\nletters, he gazed no longer in rapt adoration, he brought no more votive\nofferings of gum and pencils to her shrine. At first we thought he had\nbeen cured by the unmerciful chaffing he had to undergo from his mates,\nbut eventually his sister told Cecily the true reason. Cyrus had at last\nbeen driven to believe that Cecily’s aversion to him was real, and not\nmerely the defence of maiden coyness. If she hated him so intensely that\nshe would rather write that note on the blackboard than sit with him,\nwhat use was it to sigh like a furnace longer for her? Mr. Perkins had\nblighted love’s young dream for Cyrus with a killing frost. Thenceforth\nsweet Cecily kept the noiseless tenor of her way unvexed by the\nattentions of enamoured swains.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. AUNT UNA’S STORY\n\n\nFelicity, and Cecily, Dan, Felix, Sara Ray and I were sitting one\nevening on the mossy stones in Uncle Roger’s hill pasture, where we had\nsat the morning the Story Girl told us the tale of the Wedding Veil of\nthe Proud Princess. But it was evening now and the valley beneath us was\nbrimmed up with the glow of the afterlight. Behind us, two tall, shapely\nspruce trees rose up against the sunset, and through the dark oriel of\ntheir sundered branches an evening star looked down. We sat on a little\nstrip of emerald grassland and before us was a sloping meadow all white\nwith daisies.\n\nWe were waiting for Peter and the Story Girl. Peter had gone to Markdale\nafter dinner to spend the afternoon with his reunited parents because\nit was his birthday. He had left us grimly determined to confess to his\nfather the dark secret of his Presbyterianism, and we were anxious to\nknow what the result had been. The Story Girl had gone that morning\nwith Miss Reade to visit the latter’s home near Charlottetown, and we\nexpected soon to see her coming gaily along over the fields from the\nArmstrong place.\n\nPresently Peter came jauntily stepping along the field path up the hill.\n\n“Hasn’t Peter got tall?” said Cecily.\n\n“Peter is growing to be a very fine looking boy,” decreed Felicity.\n\n“I notice he’s got ever so much handsomer since his father came home,”\n said Dan, with a killing sarcasm that was wholly lost on Felicity, who\ngravely responded that she supposed it was because Peter felt so much\nfreer from care and responsibility.\n\n“What luck, Peter?” yelled Dan, as soon as Peter was within earshot.\n\n“Everything’s all right,” he shouted jubilantly. “I told father right\noff, licketty-split, as soon as I got home,” he added when he reached\nus. “I was anxious to have it over with. I says, solemn-like, ‘Dad,\nthere’s something I’ve got to tell you, and I don’t know how you’ll take\nit, but it can’t be helped,’ I says. Dad looked pretty sober, and he\nsays, says he, ‘What have you been up to, Peter? Don’t be afraid to tell\nme. I’ve been forgiven to seventy times seven, so surely I can forgive a\nlittle, too?’ ‘Well,’ I says, desperate-like, ‘the truth is, father, I’m\na Presbyterian. I made up my mind last summer, the time of the Judgment\nDay, that I’d be a Presbyterian, and I’ve got to stick to it. I’m sorry\nI can’t be a Methodist, like you and mother and Aunt Jane, but I can’t\nand that’s all there is to it,’ I says. Then I waited, scared-like. But\nfather, he just looked relieved and he says, says he, ‘Goodness, boy,\nyou can be a Presbyterian or anything else you like, so long as it’s\nProtestant. I’m not caring,’ he says. ‘The main thing is that you must\nbe good and do what’s right.’ I tell you,” concluded Peter emphatically,\n“father is a Christian all right.”\n\n“Well, I suppose your mind will be at rest now,” said Felicity. “What’s\nthat you have in your buttonhole?”\n\n“That’s a four-leaved clover,” answered Peter exultantly. “That means\ngood luck for the summer. I found it in Markdale. There ain’t much\nclover in Carlisle this year of any kind of leaf. The crop is going to\nbe a failure. Your Uncle Roger says it’s because there ain’t enough\nold maids in Carlisle. There’s lots of them in Markdale, and that’s the\nreason, he says, why they always have such good clover crops there.”\n\n“What on earth have old maids to do with it?” cried Cecily.\n\n“I don’t believe they’ve a single thing to do with it, but Mr. Roger\nsays they have, and he says a man called Darwin proved it. This is the\nrigmarole he got off to me the other day. The clover crop depends on\nthere being plenty of bumble-bees, because they are the only insects\nwith tongues long enough to--to--fer--fertilize--I think he called it\nthe blossoms. But mice eat bumble-bees and cats eat mice and old maids\nkeep cats. So your Uncle Roger says the more old maids the more cats,\nand the more cats the fewer field-mice, and the fewer field-mice the\nmore bumble-bees, and the more bumble-bees the better clover crops.”\n\n“So don’t worry if you do get to be old maids, girls,” said Dan.\n“Remember, you’ll be helping the clover crops.”\n\n“I never heard such stuff as you boys talk,” said Felicity, “and Uncle\nRoger is no better.”\n\n“There comes the Story Girl,” cried Cecily eagerly. “Now we’ll hear all\nabout Beautiful Alice’s home.”\n\nThe Story Girl was bombarded with eager questions as soon as she\narrived. Miss Reade’s home was a dream of a place, it appeared. The\nhouse was just covered with ivy and there was a most delightful old\ngarden--“and,” added the Story Girl, with the joy of a connoisseur who\nhas found a rare gem, “the sweetest little story connected with it. And\nI saw the hero of the story too.”\n\n“Where was the heroine?” queried Cecily.\n\n“She is dead.”\n\n“Oh, of course she’d have to die,” exclaimed Dan in disgust. “I’d like a\nstory where somebody lived once in awhile.”\n\n“I’ve told you heaps of stories where people lived,” retorted the Story\nGirl. “If this heroine hadn’t died there wouldn’t have been any story.\nShe was Miss Reade’s aunt and her name was Una, and I believe she must\nhave been just like Miss Reade herself. Miss Reade told me all about\nher. When we went into the garden I saw in one corner of it an old stone\nbench arched over by a couple of pear trees and all grown about with\ngrass and violets. And an old man was sitting on it--a bent old man with\nlong, snow-white hair and beautiful sad blue eyes. He seemed very lonely\nand sorrowful and I wondered that Miss Reade didn’t speak to him. But\nshe never let on she saw him and took me away to another part of the\ngarden. After awhile he got up and went away and then Miss Reade said,\n‘Come over to Aunt Una’s seat and I will tell you about her and her\nlover--that man who has just gone out.’\n\n“‘Oh, isn’t he too old for a lover?’ I said.\n\n“Beautiful Alice laughed and said it was forty years since he had been\nher Aunt Una’s lover. He had been a tall, handsome young man then, and\nher Aunt Una was a beautiful girl of nineteen.\n\n“We went over and sat down and Miss Reade told me all about her. She\nsaid that when she was a child she had heard much of her Aunt Una--that\nshe seemed to have been one of those people who are not soon forgotten,\nwhose personality seems to linger about the scenes of their lives long\nafter they have passed away.”\n\n“What is a personality? Is it another word for ghost?” asked Peter.\n\n“No,” said the Story Girl shortly. “I can’t stop in a story to explain\nwords.”\n\n“I don’t believe you know what it is yourself,” said Felicity.\n\nThe Story Girl picked up her hat, which she had thrown down on the\ngrass, and placed it defiantly on her brown curls.\n\n“I’m going in,” she announced. “I have to help Aunt Olivia ice a cake\ntonight, and you all seem more interested in dictionaries than stories.”\n\n“That’s not fair,” I exclaimed. “Dan and Felix and Sara Ray and Cecily\nand I have never said a word. It’s mean to punish us for what Peter and\nFelicity did. We want to hear the rest of the story. Never mind what a\npersonality is but go on--and, Peter, you young ass, keep still.”\n\n“I only wanted to know,” muttered Peter sulkily.\n\n“I DO know what personality is, but it’s hard to explain,” said the\nStory Girl, relenting. “It’s what makes you different from Dan, Peter,\nand me different from Felicity or Cecily. Miss Reade’s Aunt Una had a\npersonality that was very uncommon. And she was beautiful, too, with\nwhite skin and night-black eyes and hair--a ‘moonlight beauty,’ Miss\nReade called it. She used to keep a kind of a diary, and Miss Reade’s\nmother used to read parts of it to her. She wrote verses in it and they\nwere lovely; and she wrote descriptions of the old garden which she\nloved very much. Miss Reade said that everything in the garden, plot\nor shrub or tree, recalled to her mind some phrase or verse of her\nAunt Una’s, so that the whole place seemed full of her, and her memory\nhaunted the walks like a faint, sweet perfume.\n\n“Una had, as I’ve told you, a lover; and they were to have been married\non her twentieth birthday. Her wedding dress was to have been a gown of\nwhite brocade with purple violets in it. But a little while before it\nshe took ill with fever and died; and she was buried on her birthday\ninstead of being married. It was just in the time of opening roses. Her\nlover has been faithful to her ever since; he has never married, and\nevery June, on her birthday, he makes a pilgrimage to the old garden and\nsits for a long time in silence on the bench where he used to woo her\non crimson eves and moonlight nights of long ago. Miss Reade says she\nalways loves to see him sitting there because it gives her such a deep\nand lasting sense of the beauty and strength of love which can thus\noutlive time and death. And sometimes, she says, it gives her a little\neerie feeling, too, as if her Aunt Una were really sitting there beside\nhim, keeping tryst, although she has been in her grave for forty years.”\n\n“It would be real romantic to die young and have your lover make a\npilgrimage to your garden every year,” reflected Sara Ray.\n\n“It would be more comfortable to go on living and get married to him,”\n said Felicity. “Mother says all those sentimental ideas are bosh and I\nexpect they are. It’s a wonder Beautiful Alice hasn’t a beau herself.\nShe is so pretty and lady-like.”\n\n“The Carlisle fellows all say she is too stuck up,” said Dan.\n\n“There’s nobody in Carlisle half good enough for her,” cried the Story\nGirl, “except--ex-cept--”\n\n“Except who?” asked Felix.\n\n“Never mind,” said the Story Girl mysteriously.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. AUNT OLIVIA’S WEDDING\n\n\nWhat a delightful, old-fashioned, wholesome excitement there was about\nAunt Olivia’s wedding! The Monday and Tuesday preceding it we did not go\nto school at all, but were all kept home to do chores and run errands.\nThe cooking and decorating and arranging that went on those two days\nwas amazing, and Felicity was so happy over it all that she did not even\nquarrel with Dan--though she narrowly escaped it when he told her that\nthe Governor’s wife was coming to the wedding.\n\n“Mind you have some of her favourite rusks for her,” he said.\n\n“I guess,” said Felicity with dignity, “that Aunt Olivia’s wedding\nsupper will be good enough for even a Governor’s wife.”\n\n“I s’pose none of us except the Story Girl will get to the first table,”\n said Felix, rather gloomily.\n\n“Never mind,” comforted Felicity. “There’s a whole turkey to be kept for\nus, and a freezerful of ice cream. Cecily and I are going to wait on the\ntables, and we’ll put away a little of everything that’s extra nice for\nour suppers.”\n\n“I do so want to have my supper with you,” sighed Sara Ray, “but I\ns’pose ma will drag me with her wherever she goes. She won’t trust me\nout of her sight a minute the whole evening--I know she won’t.”\n\n“I’ll get Aunt Olivia to ask her to let you have your supper with us,”\n said Cecily. “She can’t refuse the bride’s request.”\n\n“You don’t know all ma can do,” returned Sara darkly. “No, I feel that\nI’ll have to eat my supper with her. But I suppose I ought to be very\nthankful I’m to get to the wedding at all, and that ma did get me a\nnew white dress for it. Even yet I’m so scared something will happen to\nprevent me from getting to it.”\n\nMonday evening shrouded itself in clouds, and all night long the voice\nof the wind answered to the voice of the rain. Tuesday the downpour\ncontinued. We were quite frantic about it. Suppose it kept on raining\nover Wednesday! Aunt Olivia couldn’t be married in the orchard then.\nThat would be too bad, especially when the late apple tree had most\nobligingly kept its store of blossom until after all the other trees had\nfaded and then burst lavishly into bloom for Aunt Olivia’s wedding. That\napple tree was always very late in blooming, and this year it was a week\nlater than usual. It was a sight to see--a great tree-pyramid with high,\nfar-spreading boughs, over which a wealth of rosy snow seemed to have\nbeen flung. Never had bride a more magnificent canopy.\n\nTo our rapture, however, it cleared up beautifully Tuesday evening,\nand the sun, before setting in purple pomp, poured a flood of wonderful\nradiance over the whole great, green, diamond-dripping world, promising\na fair morrow. Uncle Alec drove off to the station through it to bring\nhome the bridegroom and his best man. Dan was full of a wild idea that\nwe should all meet them at the gate, armed with cowbells and tin-pans,\nand “charivari” them up the lane. Peter sided with him, but the rest of\nus voted down the suggestion.\n\n“Do you want Dr. Seton to think we are a pack of wild Indians?” asked\nFelicity severely. “A nice opinion he’d have of our manners!”\n\n“Well, it’s the only chance we’ll have to chivaree them,” grumbled Dan.\n“Aunt Olivia wouldn’t mind. SHE can take a joke.”\n\n“Ma would kill you if you did such a thing,” warned Felicity. “Dr. Seton\nlives in Halifax and they NEVER chivaree people there. He would think it\nvery vulgar.”\n\n“Then he should have stayed in Halifax and got married there,” retorted\nDan, sulkily.\n\nWe were very curious to see our uncle-elect. When he came and Uncle\nAlec took him into the parlour, we were all crowded into the dark corner\nbehind the stairs to peep at him. Then we fled to the moonlight world\noutside and discussed him at the dairy.\n\n“He’s bald,” said Cecily disappointedly.\n\n“And RATHER short and stout,” said Felicity.\n\n“He’s forty, if he’s a day,” said Dan.\n\n“Never you mind,” cried the Story Girl loyally, “Aunt Olivia loves him\nwith all her heart.”\n\n“And more than that, he’s got lots of money,” added Felicity.\n\n“Well, he may be all right,” said Peter, “but it’s my opinion that your\nAunt Olivia could have done just as well on the Island.”\n\n“YOUR opinion doesn’t matter very much to our family,” said Felicity\ncrushingly.\n\nBut when we made the acquaintance of Dr. Seton next morning we liked him\nenormously, and voted him a jolly good fellow. Even Peter remarked aside\nto me that he guessed Miss Olivia hadn’t made much of a mistake after\nall, though it was plain he thought she was running a risk in not\nsticking to the Island. The girls had not much time to discuss him with\nus. They were all exceedingly busy and whisked about at such a rate\nthat they seemed to possess the power of being in half a dozen places\nat once. The importance of Felicity was quite terrible. But after dinner\ncame a lull.\n\n“Thank goodness, everything is ready at last,” breathed Felicity\ndevoutly, as we foregathered for a brief space in the fir wood. “We’ve\nnothing more to do now but get dressed. It’s really a serious thing to\nhave a wedding in the family.”\n\n“I have a note from Sara Ray,” said Cecily. “Judy Pineau brought it up\nwhen she brought Mrs. Ray’s spoons. Just let me read it to you:--\n\n\n  DEAREST CECILY:--A DREADFUL MISFORTUNE has happened to me.  Last\n  night I went with Judy to water the cows and in the spruce bush we\n  found a WASPS’ NEST and Judy thought it was AN OLD ONE and she\n  POKED IT WITH A STICK.  And it was a NEW ONE, full of wasps, and\n  they all flew out and STUNG US TERRIBLY, on the face and hands.\n  My face is all swelled up and I can HARDLY SEE out of one eye.\n  The SUFFERING was awful but I didn’t mind that as much as being\n  scared ma wouldn’t take me to the wedding.  But she says I can go\n  and I’m going.  I know that I am a HARD-LOOKING SIGHT, but it\n  isn’t anything catching.  I am writing this so that you won’t get\n  a shock when you see me.  Isn’t it SO STRANGE to think your dear\n  Aunt Olivia is going away?  How you will miss her!  But your loss\n  will be her gain.\n\n                    “‘Au revoir,\n                         “‘Your loving chum,\n                                     SARA RAY.’”\n\n\n“That poor child,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“Well, all I hope is that strangers won’t take her for one of the\nfamily,” remarked Felicity in a disgusted tone.\n\nAunt Olivia was married at five o’clock in the orchard under the late\napple tree. It was a pretty scene. The air was full of the perfume of\napple bloom, and the bees blundered foolishly and delightfully from one\nblossom to another, half drunken with perfume. The old orchard was full\nof smiling guests in wedding garments. Aunt Olivia was most beautiful\namid the frost of her bridal veil, and the Story Girl, in an unusually\nlong white dress, with her brown curls clubbed up behind, looked so tall\nand grown-up that we hardly recognized her. After the ceremony--during\nwhich Sara Ray cried all the time--there was a royal wedding supper, and\nSara Ray was permitted to eat her share of the feast with us.\n\n“I’m glad I was stung by the wasps after all,” she said delightedly.\n“If I hadn’t been ma would never have let me eat with you. She just got\ntired explaining to people what was the matter with my face, and so\nshe was glad to get rid of me. I know I look awful, but, oh, wasn’t the\nbride a dream?”\n\nWe missed the Story Girl, who, of course, had to have her supper at\nthe bridal table; but we were a hilarious little crew and the girls had\nnobly kept their promise to save tid-bits for us. By the time the last\ntable was cleared away Aunt Olivia and our new uncle were ready to go.\nThere was an orgy of tears and leavetakings, and then they drove away\ninto the odorous moonlight night. Dan and Peter pursued them down the\nlane with a fiendish din of bells and pans, much to Felicity’s wrath.\nBut Aunt Olivia and Uncle Robert took it in good part and waved their\nhands back to us with peals of laughter.\n\n“They’re just that pleased with themselves that they wouldn’t mind if\nthere was an earthquake,” said Felix, grinning.\n\n“It’s been splendid and exciting, and everything went off well,” sighed\nCecily, “but, oh dear, it’s going to be so queer and lonesome without\nAunt Olivia. I just believe I’ll cry all night.”\n\n“You’re tired to death, that’s what’s the matter with you,” said Dan,\nreturning. “You girls have worked like slaves today.”\n\n“Tomorrow will be even harder,” said Felicity comfortingly. “Everything\nwill have to be cleaned up and put away.”\n\nPeg Bowen paid us a call the next day and was regaled with a feast of\nfat things left over from the supper.\n\n“Well, I’ve had all I can eat,” she said, when she had finished and\nbrought out her pipe. “And that doesn’t happen to me every day. There\nain’t been as much marrying as there used to be, and half the time they\njust sneak off to the minister, as if they were ashamed of it, and get\nmarried without any wedding or supper. That ain’t the King way, though.\nAnd so Olivia’s gone off at last. She weren’t in any hurry but they tell\nme she’s done well. Time’ll show.”\n\n“Why don’t you get married yourself, Peg?” queried Uncle Roger\nteasingly. We held our breath over his temerity.\n\n“Because I’m not so easy to please as your wife will be,” retorted Peg.\n\nShe departed in high good humour over her repartee. Meeting Sara Ray\non the doorstep she stopped and asked her what was the matter with her\nface.\n\n“Wasps,” stammered Sara Ray, laconic from terror.\n\n“Humph! And your hands?”\n\n“Warts.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what’ll take them away. You get a pertater and go out\nunder the full moon, cut the pertater in two, rub your warts with one\nhalf and say, ‘One, two, three, warts, go away from me.’ Then rub\nthem with the other half and say, ‘One, two, three, four, warts, never\ntrouble me more.’ Then bury the pertater and never tell a living soul\nwhere you buried it. You won’t have no more warts. Mind you bury the\npertater, though. If you don’t, and anyone picks it up, she’ll get your\nwarts.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. SARA RAY HELPS OUT\n\n\nWe all missed Aunt Olivia greatly; she had been so merry and\ncompanionable, and had possessed such a knack of understanding small\nfry. But youth quickly adapts itself to changed conditions; in a few\nweeks it seemed as if the Story Girl had always been living at Uncle\nAlec’s, and as if Uncle Roger had always had a fat, jolly housekeeper\nwith a double chin and little, twinkling blue eyes. I don’t think Aunt\nJanet ever quite got over missing Aunt Olivia, or looked upon Mrs.\nHawkins as anything but a necessary evil; but life resumed its even\ntenor on the King farm, broken only by the ripples of excitement over\nthe school concert and letters from Aunt Olivia describing her trip\nthrough the land of Evangeline. We incorporated the letters in Our\nMagazine under the heading “From Our Special Correspondent” and were\nvery proud of them.\n\nAt the end of June our school concert came off and was a great event\nin our young lives. It was the first appearance of most of us on any\nplatform, and some of us were very nervous. We all had recitations,\nexcept Dan, who had refused flatly to take any part and was consequently\ncare-free.\n\n“I’m sure I shall die when I find myself up on that platform, facing\npeople,” sighed Sara Ray, as we talked the affair over in Uncle\nStephen’s Walk the night before the concert.\n\n“I’m afraid I’ll faint,” was Cecily’s more moderate foreboding.\n\n“I’m not one single bit nervous,” said Felicity complacently.\n\n“I’m not nervous this time,” said the Story Girl, “but the first time I\nrecited I was.”\n\n“My Aunt Jane,” remarked Peter, “used to say that an old teacher of hers\ntold her that when she was going to recite or speak in public she must\njust get it firmly into her mind that it was only a lot of cabbage heads\nshe had before her, and she wouldn’t be nervous.”\n\n“One mightn’t be nervous, but I don’t think there would be much\ninspiration in reciting to cabbage heads,” said the Story Girl\ndecidedly. “I want to recite to PEOPLE, and see them looking interested\nand thrilled.”\n\n“If I can only get through my piece without breaking down I don’t care\nwhether I thrill people or not,” said Sara Ray.\n\n“I’m afraid I’ll forget mine and get stuck,” foreboded Felix. “Some of\nyou fellows be sure and prompt me if I do--and do it quick, so’s I won’t\nget worse rattled.”\n\n“I know one thing,” said Cecily resolutely, “and that is, I’m going\nto curl my hair for to-morrow night. I’ve never curled it since Peter\nalmost died, but I simply must tomorrow night, for all the other girls\nare going to have theirs in curls.”\n\n“The dew and heat will take all the curl out of yours and then you’ll\nlook like a scarecrow,” warned Felicity.\n\n“No, I won’t. I’m going to put my hair up in paper tonight and wet it\nwith a curling-fluid that Judy Pineau uses. Sara brought me up a bottle\nof it. Judy says it is great stuff--your hair will keep in curl for\ndays, no matter how damp the weather is. I’ll leave my hair in the\npapers till tomorrow evening, and then I’ll have beautiful curls.”\n\n“You’d better leave your hair alone,” said Dan gruffly. “Smooth hair is\nbetter than a lot of fly-away curls.”\n\nBut Cecily was not to be persuaded. Curls she craved and curls she meant\nto have.\n\n“I’m thankful my warts have all gone, any-way,” said Sara Ray.\n\n“So they have,” exclaimed Felicity. “Did you try Peg’s recipe?”\n\n“Yes. I didn’t believe in it but I tried it. For the first few days\nafterwards I kept watching my warts, but they didn’t go away, and then\nI gave up and forgot them. But one day last week I just happened to look\nat my hands and there wasn’t a wart to be seen. It was the most amazing\nthing.”\n\n“And yet you’ll say Peg Bowen isn’t a witch,” said Peter.\n\n“Pshaw, it was just the potato juice,” scoffed Dan.\n\n“It was a dry old potato I had, and there wasn’t much juice in it,”\n said Sara Ray. “One hardly knows what to believe. But one thing is\ncertain--my warts are gone.”\n\nCecily put her hair up in curl-papers that night, thoroughly soaked in\nJudy Pineau’s curling-fluid. It was a nasty job, for the fluid was very\nsticky, but Cecily persevered and got it done. Then she went to bed with\na towel tied over her head to protect the pillow. She did not sleep\nwell and had uncanny dreams, but she came down to breakfast with an\nexpression of triumph. The Story Girl examined her head critically and\nsaid,\n\n“Cecily, if I were you I’d take those papers out this morning.”\n\n“Oh, no; if I do my hair will be straight again by night. I mean to\nleave them in till the last minute.”\n\n“I wouldn’t do that--I really wouldn’t,” persisted the Story Girl. “If\nyou do your hair will be too curly and all bushy and fuzzy.”\n\nCecily finally yielded and went upstairs with the Story Girl. Presently\nwe heard a little shriek--then two little shrieks--then three. Then\nFelicity came flying down and called her mother. Aunt Janet went up and\npresently came down again with a grim mouth. She filled a large pan with\nwarm water and carried it upstairs. We dared ask her no questions, but\nwhen Felicity came down to wash the dishes we bombarded her.\n\n“What on earth is the matter with Cecily?” demanded Dan. “Is she sick?”\n\n“No, she isn’t. I warned her not to put her hair in curls but she\nwouldn’t listen to me. I guess she wishes she had now. When people\nhaven’t natural curly hair they shouldn’t try to make it curly. They get\npunished if they do.”\n\n“Look here, Felicity, never mind all that. Just tell us what has\nhappened Sis.”\n\n“Well, this is what has happened her. That ninny of a Sara Ray brought\nup a bottle of mucilage instead of Judy’s curling-fluid, and Cecily put\nher hair up with THAT. It’s in an awful state.”\n\n“Good gracious!” exclaimed Dan. “Look here, will she ever get it out?”\n\n“Goodness knows. She’s got her head in soak now. Her hair is just matted\ntogether hard as a board. That’s what comes of vanity,” said Felicity,\nthan whom no vainer girl existed.\n\nPoor Cecily paid dearly enough for HER vanity. She spent a bad forenoon,\nmade no easier by her mother’s severe rebukes. For an hour she “soaked”\n her head; that is, she stood over a panful of warm water and kept\ndipping her head in with tightly shut eyes. Finally her hair softened\nsufficiently to be disentangled from the curl papers; and then Aunt\nJanet subjected it to a merciless shampoo. Eventually they got all the\nmucilage washed out of it and Cecily spent the remainder of the forenoon\nsitting before the open oven door in the hot kitchen drying her ill-used\ntresses. She felt very down-hearted; her hair was of that order which,\nglossy and smooth normally, is dry and harsh and lustreless for several\ndays after being shampooed.\n\n“I’ll look like a fright tonight,” said the poor child to me with\ntrembling voice. “The ends will be sticking out all over my head.”\n\n“Sara Ray is a perfect idiot,” I said wrathfully\n\n“Oh, don’t be hard on poor Sara. She didn’t mean to bring me mucilage.\nIt’s really all my own fault, I know. I made a solemn vow when Peter was\ndying that I would never curl my hair again, and I should have kept it.\nIt isn’t right to break solemn vows. But my hair will look like dried\nhay tonight.”\n\nPoor Sara Ray was quite overwhelmed when she came up and found what\nshe had done. Felicity was very hard on her, and Aunt Janet was coldly\ndisapproving, but sweet Cecily forgave her unreservedly, and they walked\nto the school that night with their arms about each other’s waists as\nusual.\n\nThe school-room was crowded with friends and neighbours. Mr. Perkins was\nflying about, getting things into readiness, and Miss Reade, who was\nthe organist of the evening, was sitting on the platform, looking her\nsweetest and prettiest. She wore a delightful white lace hat with a\nfetching little wreath of tiny forget-me-nots around the brim, a white\nmuslin dress with sprays of blue violets scattered over it, and a black\nlace scarf.\n\n“Doesn’t she look angelic?” said Cecily rapturously.\n\n“Mind you,” said Sara Ray, “the Awkward Man is here--in the corner\nbehind the door. I never remember seeing him at a concert before.”\n\n“I suppose he came to hear the Story Girl recite,” said Felicity. “He is\nsuch a friend of hers.”\n\nThe concert went off very well. Dialogues, choruses and recitations\nfollowed each other in rapid succession. Felix got through his without\n“getting stuck,” and Peter did excellently, though he stuffed his hands\nin his trousers pockets--a habit of which Mr. Perkins had vainly tried\nto break him. Peter’s recitation was one greatly in vogue at that time,\nbeginning,\n\n\n     “My name is Norval; on the Grampian hills\n      My father feeds his flocks.”\n\n\nAt our first practice Peter had started gaily in, rushing through the\nfirst line with no thought whatever of punctuation--“My name is Norval\non the Grampian Hills.”\n\n“Stop, stop, Peter,” quoth Mr. Perkins, sarcastically, “your name might\nbe Norval if you were never on the Grampian Hills. There’s a semi-colon\nin that line, I wish you to remember.”\n\nPeter did remember it. Cecily neither fainted nor failed when it came\nher turn. She recited her little piece very well, though somewhat\nmechanically. I think she really did much better than if she had had her\ndesired curls. The miserable conviction that her hair, alone among\nthat glossy-tressed bevy, was looking badly, quite blotted out all\nnervousness and self-consciousness from her mind. Her hair apart, she\nlooked very pretty. The prevailing excitement had made bright her eye\nand flushed her cheeks rosily--too rosily, perhaps. I heard a Carlisle\nwoman behind me whisper that Cecily King looked consumptive, just like\nher Aunt Felicity; and I hated her fiercely for it.\n\nSara Ray also managed to get through respectably, although she was\npitiably nervous. Her bow was naught but a short nod--“as if her head\nworked on wires,” whispered Felicity uncharitably--and the wave of her\nlily-white hand more nearly resembled an agonized jerk than a wave. We\nall felt relieved when she finished. She was, in a sense, one of “our\ncrowd,” and we had been afraid she would disgrace us by breaking down.\n\nFelicity followed her and recited her selection without haste, without\nrest, and absolutely without any expression whatever. But what mattered\nit how she recited? To look at her was sufficient. What with her\nsplendid fleece of golden curls, her great, brilliant blue eyes, her\nexquisitely tinted face, her dimpled hands and arms, every member of the\naudience must have felt it was worth the ten cents he had paid merely to\nsee her.\n\nThe Story Girl followed. An expectant silence fell over the room, and\nMr. Perkins’ face lost the look of tense anxiety it had worn all the\nevening. Here was a performer who could be depended on. No need to\nfear stage fright or forgetfulness on her part. The Story Girl was not\nlooking her best that night. White never became her, and her face\nwas pale, though her eyes were splendid. But nobody thought about her\nappearance when the power and magic of her voice caught and held her\nlisteners spellbound.\n\nHer recitation was an old one, figuring in one of the School Readers,\nand we scholars all knew it off by heart. Sara Ray alone had not heard\nthe Story Girl recite it. The latter had not been drilled at practices\nas had the other pupils, Mr. Perkins choosing not to waste time teaching\nher what she already knew far better than he did. The only time she had\nrecited it had been at the “dress rehearsal” two nights before, at which\nSara Ray had not been present.\n\nIn the poem a Florentine lady of old time, wedded to a cold and cruel\nhusband, had died, or was supposed to have died, and had been carried to\n“the rich, the beautiful, the dreadful tomb” of her proud family. In\nthe night she wakened from her trance and made her escape. Chilled and\nterrified, she had made her way to her husband’s door, only to be driven\naway brutally as a restless ghost by the horror-stricken inmates. A\nsimilar reception awaited her at her father’s. Then she had wandered\nblindly through the streets of Florence until she had fallen exhausted\nat the door of the lover of her girlhood. He, unafraid, had taken her\nin and cared for her. On the morrow, the husband and father, having\ndiscovered the empty tomb, came to claim her. She refused to return to\nthem and the case was carried to the court of law. The verdict given was\nthat a woman who had been “to burial borne” and left for dead, who had\nbeen driven from her husband’s door and from her childhood home, “must\nbe adjudged as dead in law and fact,” was no more daughter or wife, but\nwas set free to form what new ties she would. The climax of the whole\nselection came in the line,\n\n“The court pronounces the defendant--DEAD!” and the Story Girl was wont\nto render it with such dramatic intensity and power that the veriest\ndullard among her listeners could not have missed its force and\nsignificance.\n\nShe swept along through the poem royally, playing on the emotions of her\naudience as she had so often played on ours in the old orchard. Pity,\nterror, indignation, suspense, possessed her hearers in turn. In\nthe court scene she surpassed herself. She was, in very truth, the\nFlorentine judge, stern, stately, impassive. Her voice dropped into the\nsolemnity of the all-important line,\n\n“‘The court pronounces the defendant--’”\n\nShe paused for a breathless moment, the better to bring out the tragic\nimport of the last word.\n\n“DEAD,” piped up Sara Ray in her shrill, plaintive little voice.\n\nThe effect, to use a hackneyed but convenient phrase, can better be\nimagined than described. Instead of the sigh of relieved tension that\nshould have swept over the audience at the conclusion of the line,\na burst of laughter greeted it. The Story Girl’s performance was\ncompletely spoiled. She dealt the luckless Sara a glance that would have\nslain her on the spot could glances kill, stumbled lamely and impotently\nthrough the few remaining lines of her recitation, and fled with crimson\ncheeks to hide her mortification in the little corner that had been\ncurtained off for a dressing-room. Mr. Perkins looked things not lawful\nto be uttered, and the audience tittered at intervals for the rest of\nthe performance.\n\nSara Ray alone remained serenely satisfied until the close of the\nconcert, when we surrounded her with a whirlwind of reproaches.\n\n“Why,” she stammered aghast, “what did I do? I--I thought she was stuck\nand that I ought to prompt her quick.”\n\n“You little fool, she just paused for effect,” cried Felicity angrily.\nFelicity might be rather jealous of the Story Girl’s gift, but she\nwas furious at beholding “one of our family” made ridiculous in such a\nfashion. “You have less sense than anyone I ever heard of, Sara Ray.”\n\nPoor Sara dissolved in tears.\n\n“I didn’t know. I thought she was stuck,” she wailed again.\n\nShe cried all the way home, but we did not try to comfort her. We felt\nquite out of patience with her. Even Cecily was seriously annoyed. This\nsecond blunder of Sara’s was too much even for her loyalty. We saw her\nturn in at her own gate and go sobbing up her lane with no relenting.\n\nThe Story Girl was home before us, having fled from the schoolhouse as\nsoon as the programme was over. We tried to sympathize with her but she\nwould not be sympathized with.\n\n“Please don’t ever mention it to me again,” she said, with compressed\nlips. “I never want to be reminded of it. Oh, that little IDIOT!”\n\n“She spoiled Peter’s sermon last summer and now she’s spoiled your\nrecitation,” said Felicity. “I think it’s time we gave up associating\nwith Sara Ray.”\n\n“Oh, don’t be quite so hard on her,” pleaded Cecily. “Think of the life\nthe poor child has to live at home. I know she’ll cry all night.”\n\n“Oh, let’s go to bed,” growled Dan. “I’m good and ready for it. I’ve had\nenough of school concerts.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. BY WAY OF THE STARS\n\n\nBut for two of us the adventures of the night were not yet over. Silence\nsettled down over the old house--the eerie, whisperful, creeping silence\nof night. Felix and Dan were already sound asleep; I was drifting near\nthe coast o’ dreams when I was aroused by a light tap on the door.\n\n“Bev, are you asleep?” came in the Story Girl’s whisper.\n\n“No, what is it?”\n\n“S-s-h. Get up and dress and come out. I want you.”\n\nWith a good deal of curiosity and some misgiving I obeyed. What was in\nthe wind now? Outside in the hall I found the Story Girl, with a candle\nin her hand, and her hat and jacket.\n\n“Where are you going?” I whispered in amazement.\n\n“Hush. I’ve got to go to the school and you must come with me. I left my\ncoral necklace there. The clasp came loose and I was so afraid I’d lose\nit that I took it off and put it in the bookcase. I was feeling so upset\nwhen the concert was over that I forgot all about it.”\n\nThe coral necklace was a very handsome one which had belonged to the\nStory Girl’s mother. She had never been permitted to wear it before, and\nit had only been by dint of much coaxing that she had induced Aunt Janet\nto let her wear it to the concert.\n\n“But there’s no sense in going for it in the dead of night,” I objected.\n“It will be quite safe. You can go for it in the morning.”\n\n“Lizzie Paxton and her daughter are going to clean the school tomorrow,\nand I heard Lizzie say tonight she meant to be at it by five o’clock to\nget through before the heat of the day. You know perfectly well what\nLiz Paxton’s reputation is. If she finds that necklace I’ll never see it\nagain. Besides, if I wait till the morning, Aunt Janet may find out that\nI left it there and she’d never let me wear it again. No, I’m going for\nit now. If you’re afraid,” added the Story Girl with delicate scorn, “of\ncourse you needn’t come.”\n\nAfraid! I’d show her!\n\n“Come on,” I said.\n\nWe slipped out of the house noiselessly and found ourselves in the\nunutterable solemnity and strangeness of a dark night. It was a new\nexperience, and our hearts thrilled and our nerves tingled to the charm\nof it. Never had we been abroad before at such an hour. The world around\nus was not the world of daylight. ‘Twas an alien place, full of weird,\nevasive enchantment and magicry.\n\nOnly in the country can one become truly acquainted with the night.\nThere it has the solemn calm of the infinite. The dim wide fields lie in\nsilence, wrapped in the holy mystery of darkness. A wind, loosened from\nwild places far away, steals out to blow over dewy, star-lit, immemorial\nhills. The air in the pastures is sweet with the hush of dreams, and one\nmay rest here like a child on its mother’s breast.\n\n“Isn’t it wonderful?” breathed the Story Girl as we went down the long\nhill. “Do you know, I can forgive Sara Ray now. I thought tonight I\nnever could--but now it doesn’t matter any more. I can even see how\nfunny it was. Oh, wasn’t it funny? ‘DEAD’ in that squeaky little voice\nof Sara’s! I’ll just behave to her tomorrow as if nothing had happened.\nIt seems so long ago now, here in the night.”\n\nNeither of us ever forgot the subtle delight of that stolen walk. A\nspell of glamour was over us. The breezes whispered strange secrets of\nelf-haunted glens, and the hollows where the ferns grew were brimmed\nwith mystery and romance. Ghostlike scents crept out of the meadows\nto meet us, and the fir wood before we came to the church was a living\nsweetness of Junebells growing in abundance.\n\nJunebells have another and more scientific name, of course. But who\ncould desire a better name than Junebells? They are so perfect in their\nway that they seem to epitomize the very scent and charm of the forest,\nas if the old wood’s daintiest thoughts had materialized in blossom;\nand not all the roses by Bendameer’s stream are as fragrant as a shallow\nsheet of Junebells under the boughs of fir.\n\nThere were fireflies abroad that night, too, increasing the gramarye of\nit. There is certainly something a little supernatural about fireflies.\nNobody pretends to understand them. They are akin to the tribes of\nfairy, survivals of the elder time when the woods and hills swarmed with\nthe little green folk. It is still very easy to believe in fairies when\nyou see those goblin lanterns glimmering among the fir tassels.\n\n“Isn’t it beautiful?” said the Story Girl in rapture. “I wouldn’t have\nmissed it for anything. I’m glad I left my necklace. And I am glad you\nare with me, Bev. The others wouldn’t understand so well. I like you\nbecause I don’t have to talk to you all the time. It’s so nice to walk\nwith someone you don’t have to talk to. Here is the graveyard. Are you\nfrightened to pass it, Bev?”\n\n“No, I don’t think I’m frightened,” I answered slowly, “but I have a\nqueer feeling.”\n\n“So have I. But it isn’t fear. I don’t know what it is. I feel as if\nsomething was reaching out of the graveyard to hold me--something that\nwanted life--I don’t like it--let’s hurry. But isn’t it strange to think\nof all the dead people in there who were once alive like you and me. I\ndon’t feel as if I could EVER die. Do you?”\n\n“No, but everybody must. Of course we go on living afterwards, just the\nsame. Don’t let’s talk of such things here,” I said hurriedly.\n\nWhen we reached the school I contrived to open a window. We scrambled\nin, lighted a lamp and found the missing necklace. The Story Girl stood\non the platform and gave an imitation of the catastrophe of the evening\nthat made me shout with laughter. We prowled around for sheer delight\nover being there at an unearthly hour when everybody supposed we were\nsound asleep in our beds. It was with regret that we left, and we walked\nhome as slowly as we could to prolong the adventure.\n\n“Let’s never tell anyone,” said the Story Girl, as we reached home.\n“Let’s just have it as a secret between us for ever and ever--something\nthat nobody else knows a thing about but you and me.”\n\n“We’d better keep it a secret from Aunt Janet anyhow,” I whispered,\nlaughing. “She’d think we were both crazy.”\n\n“It’s real jolly to be crazy once in a while,” said the Story Girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. EXTRACTS FROM “OUR MAGAZINE”\n\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nAs will be seen there is no Honour Roll in this number. Even Felicity\nhas thought all the beautiful thoughts that can be thought and\ncannot think any more. Peter has never got drunk but, under existing\ncircumstances, that is not greatly to his credit. As for our written\nresolutions they have silently disappeared from our chamber walls and\nthe place that once knew them knows them no more for ever. (PETER,\nPERPLEXEDLY: “Seems to me I’ve heard something like that before.”) It is\nvery sad but we will all make some new resolutions next year and maybe\nit will be easier to keep those.\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE LOCKET THAT WAS BAKED\n\nThis was a story my Aunt Jane told me about her granma when she was a\nlittle girl. Its funny to think of baking a locket, but it wasn’t to\neat. She was my great granma but Ill call her granma for short. It\nhappened when she was ten years old. Of course she wasent anybodys\ngranma then. Her father and mother and her were living in a new\nsettlement called Brinsley. Their nearest naybor was a mile away. One\nday her Aunt Hannah from Charlottetown came and wanted her ma to go\nvisiting with her. At first granma’s ma thought she couldent go because\nit was baking day and granma’s pa was away. But granma wasent afraid to\nstay alone and she knew how to bake the bread so she made her ma go\nand her Aunt Hannah took off the handsome gold locket and chain she was\nwaring round her neck and hung it on granmas and told her she could ware\nit all day. Granma was awful pleased for she had never had any jewelry.\nShe did all the chores and then was needing the loaves when she looked\nup and saw a tramp coming in and he was an awful villenus looking tramp.\nHe dident even pass the time of day but just set down on a chair. Poor\ngranma was awful fritened and she turned her back on him and went on\nneeding the loaf cold and trembling--that is, granma was trembling not\nthe loaf. She was worried about the locket. She didn’t know how she\ncould hide it for to get anywhere she would have to turn round and pass\nhim.\n\nAll of a suddent she thought she would hide it in the bread. She put her\nhand up and pulled it hard and quick and broke the fastening and needed\nit right into the loaf. Then she put the loaf in the pan and set it in\nthe oven.\n\nThe tramp hadent seen her do it and then he asked for something to eat.\nGranma got him up a meal and when hed et it he began prowling about the\nkitchen looking into everything and opening the cubbord doors. Then he\nwent into granma’s mas room and turned the buro drawers and trunk inside\nout and threw the things in them all about. All he found was a purse\nwith a dollar in it and he swore about it and took it and went away.\nWhen granma was sure he was really gone she broke down and cried. She\nforgot all about the bread and it burned as black as coal. When she\nsmelled it burning granma run and pulled it out. She was awful scared\nthe locket was spoiled but she sawed open the loaf and it was there safe\nand sound. When her Aunt Hannah came back she said granma deserved the\nlocket because she had saved it so clever and she gave it to her and\ngrandma always wore it and was very proud of it. And granma used to say\nthat was the only loaf of bread she ever spoiled in her life.\n\n                                       PETER CRAIG.\n\n\n(FELICITY: “Those stories are all very well but they are only true\nstories. It’s easy enough to write true stories. I thought Peter was\nappointed fiction editor, but he has never written any fiction since the\npaper started. That’s not MY idea of a fiction editor. He ought to make\nup stories out of his own head.” PETER, SPUNKILY: “I can do it, too,\nand I will next time. And it ain’t easier to write true stories. It’s\nharder, ‘cause you have to stick to facts.” FELICITY: “I don’t believe\nyou could make up a story.” PETER: “I’ll show you!”)\n\n\nMY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE\n\nIt’s my turn to write it but I’m SO NERVOUS. My worst adventure happened\nTWO YEARS AGO. It was an awful one. I had a striped ribbon, striped\nbrown and yellow and I LOST IT. I was very sorry for it was a handsome\nribbon and all the girls in school were jealous of it. (FELICITY: “I\nwasn’t. I didn’t think it one bit pretty.” CECILY: “Hush!”) I hunted\neverywhere but I couldn’t find it. Next day was Sunday and I was running\ninto the house by the front door and I saw SOMETHING LYING ON THE STEP\nand I thought it was my ribbon and I made a grab at it as I passed. But,\noh, it was A SNAKE! Oh, I can never describe how I felt when I felt that\nawful thing WRIGGLING IN MY HAND. I let it go and SCREAMED AND SCREAMED,\nand ma was cross at me for yelling on Sunday and made me read seven\nchapters in the Bible but I didn’t mind that much after what I had come\nthrough. I would rather DIE than have SUCH AN EXPERIENCE again.\n\n                                         SARA RAY.\n\n\n         TO FELICITY ON HER BERTHDAY\n\n         Oh maiden fair with golden hair\n         And brow of purest white,\n         Id fight for you I’d die for you\n         Let me be your faithful knite.\n\n         This is your berthday blessed day\n         You are thirteen years old today\n         May you be happy and fair as you are now\n         Until your hair is gray.\n\n         I gaze into your shining eyes,\n         They are so blue and bright.\n         Id fight for you Id die for you\n         Let me be your faithful knite.\n\n                                     A FRIEND.\n\n\n(DAN: “Great snakes, who got that up?

PEG BOWEN COMES TO CHURCH\n\n\nWhen those of us who are still left of that band of children who played\nlong years ago in the old orchard and walked the golden road together\nin joyous companionship, foregather now and again in our busy lives and\ntalk over the events of those many merry moons--there are some of our\nadventures that gleam out more vividly in memory than the others, and\nare oftener discussed. The time we bought God’s picture from Jerry\nCowan--the time Dan ate the poison berries--the time we heard the\nghostly bell ring--the bewitchment of Paddy--the visit of the Governor’s\nwife--and the night we were lost in the storm--all awaken reminiscent\njest and laughter; but none more than the recollection of the Sunday\nPeg Bowen came to church and sat in our pew. Though goodness knows, as\nFelicity would say, we did not think it any matter for laughter at the\ntime--far from it.\n\nIt was one Sunday evening in July. Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet, having\nbeen out to the morning service, did not attend in the evening, and we\nsmall fry walked together down the long hill road, wearing Sunday attire\nand trying, more or less successfully, to wear Sunday faces also. Those\nwalks to church, through the golden completeness of the summer evenings,\nwere always very pleasant to us, and we never hurried, though, on the\nother hand, we were very careful not to be late.\n\nThis particular evening was particularly beautiful. It was cool after a\nhot day, and wheat fields all about us were ripening to their harvestry.\nThe wind gossiped with the grasses along our way, and over them the\nbuttercups danced, goldenly-glad. Waves of sinuous shadow went over the\nripe hayfields, and plundering bees sang a freebooting lilt in wayside\ngardens.\n\n“The world is so lovely tonight,” said the Story Girl. “I just hate the\nthought of going into the church and shutting all the sunlight and music\noutside. I wish we could have the service outside in summer.”\n\n“I don’t think that would be very religious,” said Felicity.\n\n“I’d feel ever so much more religious outside than in,” retorted the\nStory Girl.\n\n“If the service was outside we’d have to sit in the graveyard and that\nwouldn’t be very cheerful,” said Felix.\n\n“Besides, the music isn’t shut out,” added Felicity. “The choir is\ninside.”\n\n“‘Music has charms to soothe a savage breast,’” quoted Peter, who was\ngetting into the habit of adorning his conversation with similar gems.\n“That’s in one of Shakespeare’s plays. I’m reading them now, since I got\nthrough with the Bible. They’re great.”\n\n“I don’t see when you get time to read them,” said Felicity.\n\n“Oh, I read them Sunday afternoons when I’m home.”\n\n“I don’t believe they’re fit to read on Sundays,” exclaimed Felicity.\n“Mother says Valeria Montague’s stories ain’t.”\n\n“But Shakespeare’s different from Valeria,” protested Peter.\n\n“I don’t see in what way. He wrote a lot of things that weren’t true,\njust like Valeria, and he wrote swear words too. Valeria never does\nthat. Her characters all talk in a very refined fashion.”\n\n“Well, I always skip the swear words,” said Peter. “And Mr. Marwood said\nonce that the Bible and Shakespeare would furnish any library well. So\nyou see he put them together, but I’m sure that he would never say that\nthe Bible and Valeria would make a library.”\n\n“Well, all I know is, I shall never read Shakespeare on Sunday,” said\nFelicity loftily.\n\n“I wonder what kind of a preacher young Mr. Davidson is,” speculated\nCecily.\n\n“Well, we’ll know when we hear him tonight,” said the Story Girl. “He\nought to be good, for his uncle before him was a fine preacher, though a\nvery absent-minded man. But Uncle Roger says the supply in Mr. Marwood’s\nvacation never amounts to much. I know an awfully funny story about old\nMr. Davidson. He used to be the minister in Baywater, you know, and he\nhad a large family and his children were very mischievous. One day his\nwife was ironing and she ironed a great big nightcap with a frill round\nit. One of the children took it when she wasn’t looking and hid it\nin his father’s best beaver hat--the one he wore on Sundays. When Mr.\nDavidson went to church next Sunday he put the hat on without ever\nlooking into the crown. He walked to church in a brown study and at the\ndoor he took off his hat. The nightcap just slipped down on his head, as\nif it had been put on, and the frill stood out around his face and the\nstring hung down his back. But he never noticed it, because his thoughts\nwere far away, and he walked up the church aisle and into the pulpit,\nlike that. One of his elders had to tiptoe up and tell him what he\nhad on his head. He plucked it off in a dazed fashion, held it up, and\nlooked at it. ‘Bless me, it is Sally’s nightcap!’ he exclaimed mildly.\n‘I do not know how I could have got it on.’ Then he just stuffed it into\nhis pocket calmly and went on with the service, and the long strings of\nthe nightcap hung down out of his pocket all the time.”\n\n“It seems to me,” said Peter, amid the laughter with which we greeted\nthe tale, “that a funny story is funnier when it is about a minister\nthan it is about any other man. I wonder why.”\n\n“Sometimes I don’t think it is right to tell funny stories about\nministers,” said Felicity. “It certainly isn’t respectful.”\n\n“A good story is a good story--no matter who it’s about,” said the Story\nGirl with ungrammatical relish.\n\nThere was as yet no one in the church when we reached it, so we took our\naccustomed ramble through the graveyard surrounding it. The Story Girl\nhad brought flowers for her mother’s grave as usual, and while she\narranged them on it the rest of us read for the hundredth time the\nepitaph on Great-Grandfather King’s tombstone, which had been composed\nby Great-Grandmother King. That epitaph was quite famous among the\nlittle family traditions that entwine every household with mingled mirth\nand sorrow, smiles and tears. It had a perennial fascination for us\nand we read it over every Sunday. Cut deeply in the upright slab of red\nIsland sandstone, the epitaph ran as follows:--\n\n\nSWEET DEPARTED SPIRIT\n\n     Do receive the vows a grateful widow pays,\n     Each future day and night shall hear her speak her Isaac’s praise.\n     Though thy beloved form must in the grave decay\n     Yet from her heart thy memory no time, no change shall steal away.\n     Do thou from mansions of eternal bliss\n     Remember thy distressed relict.\n     Look on her with an angel’s love--\n     Soothe her sad life and cheer her end\n     Through this world’s dangers and its griefs.\n     Then meet her with thy well-known smiles and welcome\n     At the last great day.\n\n\n“Well, I can’t make out what the old lady was driving at,” said Dan.\n\n“That’s a nice way to speak of your great-grandmother,” said Felicity\nseverely.\n\n“How does The Family Guide say you ought to speak of your great-grandma,\nsweet one?” asked Dan.\n\n“There is one thing about it that puzzles me,” remarked Cecily. “She\ncalls herself a GRATEFUL widow. Now, what was she grateful for?”\n\n“Because she was rid of him at last,” said graceless Dan.\n\n“Oh, it couldn’t have been that,” protested Cecily seriously. “I’ve\nalways heard that Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother were very much\nattached to each other.”\n\n“Maybe, then, it means she was grateful that she’d had him as long as\nshe did,” suggested Peter.\n\n“She was grateful to him because he had been so kind to her in life, I\nthink,” said Felicity.\n\n“What is a ‘distressed relict’?” asked Felix.\n\n“‘Relict’ is a word I hate,” said the Story Girl. “It sounds so much\nlike relic. Relict means just the same as widow, only a man can be a\nrelict, too.”\n\n“Great-Grandmother seemed to run short of rhymes at the last of the\nepitaph,” commented Dan.\n\n“Finding rhymes isn’t as easy as you might think,” avowed Peter, out of\nhis own experience.\n\n“I think Grandmother King intended the last of the epitaph to be in\nblank verse,” said Felicity with dignity.\n\nThere was still only a sprinkling of people in the church when we went\nin and took our places in the old-fashioned, square King pew. We had\njust got comfortably settled when Felicity said in an agitated whisper,\n“Here is Peg Bowen!”\n\nWe all stared at Peg, who was pacing composedly up the aisle. We might\nbe excused for so doing, for seldom were the decorous aisles of Carlisle\nchurch invaded by such a figure. Peg was dressed in her usual short\ndrugget skirt, rather worn and frayed around the bottom, and a waist\nof brilliant turkey red calico. She wore no hat, and her grizzled black\nhair streamed in elf locks over her shoulders. Face, arms and feet\nwere bare--and face, arms and feet were liberally powdered with\nFLOUR. Certainly no one who saw Peg that night could ever forget the\napparition.\n\nPeg’s black eyes, in which shone a more than usually wild and fitful\nlight, roved scrutinizingly over the church, then settled on our pew.\n\n“She’s coming here,” whispered Felicity in horror. “Can’t we spread out\nand make her think the pew is full?”\n\nBut the manoeuvre was too late. The only result was that Felicity and\nthe Story Girl in moving over left a vacant space between them and Peg\npromptly plumped down in it.\n\n“Well, I’m here,” she remarked aloud. “I did say once I’d never darken\nthe door of Carlisle church again, but what that boy there”--nodding\nat Peter--“said last winter set me thinking, and I concluded maybe I’d\nbetter come once in a while, to be on the safe side.”\n\nThose poor girls were in an agony. Everybody in the church was looking\nat our pew and smiling. We all felt that we were terribly disgraced; but\nwe could do nothing. Peg was enjoying herself hugely, beyond all doubt.\nFrom where she sat she could see the whole church, including pulpit and\ngallery, and her black eyes darted over it with restless glances.\n\n“Bless me, there’s Sam Kinnaird,” she exclaimed, still aloud. “He’s\nthe man that dunned Jacob Marr for four cents on the church steps one\nSunday. I heard him. ‘I think, Jacob, you owe me four cents on that cow\nyou bought last fall. Rec’llect you couldn’t make the change?’ Well, you\nknow, ‘twould a-made a cat laugh. The Kinnairds were all mighty close, I\ncan tell you. That’s how they got rich.”\n\nWhat Sam Kinnaird felt or thought during this speech, which everyone in\nthe church must have heard, I know not. Gossip had it that he changed\ncolour. We wretched occupants of the King pew were concerned only with\nour own outraged feelings.\n\n“And there’s Melita Ross,” went on Peg. “She’s got the same bonnet on\nshe had last time I was in Carlisle church six years ago. Some folks has\nthe knack of making things last. But look at the style Mrs. Elmer Brewer\nwears, will yez? Yez wouldn’t think her mother died in the poor-house,\nwould yez, now?”\n\nPoor Mrs. Brewer! From the tip of her smart kid shoes to the dainty\ncluster of ostrich tips in her bonnet--she was most immaculately and\nhandsomely arrayed; but I venture to think she could have taken\nsmall pleasure in her fashionable attire that evening. Some of the\nunregenerate, including Dan, were shaking with suppressed laughter, but\nmost of the people looked as if they were afraid to smile, lest their\nturn should come next.\n\n“There’s old Stephen Grant coming in,” exclaimed Peg viciously, shaking\nher floury fist at him, “and looking as if butter wouldn’t melt in his\nmouth. He may be an elder, but he’s a scoundrel just the same. He set\nfire to his house to get the insurance and then blamed ME for doing it.\nBut I got even with him for it. Oh, yes! He knows that, and so do I! He,\nhe!”\n\nPeg chuckled quite fiendishly and Stephen Grant tried to look as if\nnothing had been said.\n\n“Oh, will the minister never come?” moaned Felicity in my ear. “Surely\nshe’ll have to stop then.”\n\nBut the minister did not come and Peg had no intention of stopping.\n\n“There’s Maria Dean.” she resumed. “I haven’t seen Maria for years.\nI never call there for she never seems to have anything to eat in the\nhouse. She was a Clayton and the Claytons never could cook. Maria\nsorter looks as if she’d shrunk in the wash, now, don’t she? And there’s\nDouglas Nicholson. His brother put rat poison in the family pancakes.\nNice little trick that, wasn’t it? They say it was by mistake. I hope it\nWAS a mistake. His wife is all rigged out in silk. Yez wouldn’t think\nto look at her she was married in cotton--and mighty thankful to get\nmarried in anything, it’s my opinion. There’s Timothy Patterson. He’s\nthe meanest man alive--meaner’n Sam Kinnaird even. Timothy pays his\nchildren five cents apiece to go without their suppers, and then steals\nthe cents out of their pockets after they’ve gone to bed. It’s a fact.\nAnd when his old father died he wouldn’t let his wife put his best shirt\non him. He said his second best was plenty good to be buried in. That’s\nanother fact.”\n\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” wailed Felicity.\n\n“See here, Miss Bowen, you really oughtn’t to talk like that about\npeople,” expostulated Peter in a low tone, goaded thereto, despite his\nawe of Peg, by Felicity’s anguish.\n\n“Bless you, boy,” said Peg good-humouredly, “the only difference between\nme and other folks is that I say these things out loud and they just\nthink them. If I told yez all the things I know about the people in this\ncongregation you’d be amazed. Have a peppermint?”\n\nTo our horror Peg produced a handful of peppermint lozenges from the\npocket of her skirt and offered us one each. We did not dare refuse but\nwe each held our lozenge very gingerly in our hands.\n\n“Eat them,” commanded Peg rather fiercely.\n\n“Mother doesn’t allow us to eat candy in church,” faltered Felicity.\n\n“Well, I’ve seen just as fine ladies as your ma give their children\nlozenges in church,” said Peg loftily. She put a peppermint in her own\nmouth and sucked it with gusto. We were relieved, for she did not talk\nduring the process; but our relief was of short duration. A bevy of\nthree very smartly dressed young ladies, sweeping past our pew, started\nPeg off again.\n\n“Yez needn’t be so stuck up,” she said, loudly and derisively. “Yez was\nall of yez rocked in a flour barrel. And there’s old Henry Frewen, still\nabove ground. I called my parrot after him because their noses were\nexactly alike. Look at Caroline Marr, will yez? That’s a woman who’d\nlike pretty well to get married, And there’s Alexander Marr. He’s a real\nChristian, anyhow, and so’s his dog. I can always size up what a man’s\nreligion amounts to by the kind of dog he keeps. Alexander Marr is a\ngood man.”\n\nIt was a relief to hear Peg speak well of somebody; but that was the\nonly exception she made.\n\n“Look at Dave Fraser strutting in,” she went on. “That man has thanked\nGod so often that he isn’t like other people that it’s come to be true.\nHe isn’t! And there’s Susan Frewen. She’s jealous of everybody. She’s\neven jealous of Old Man Rogers because he’s buried in the best spot in\nthe graveyard. Seth Erskine has the same look he was born with. They say\nthe Lord made everybody but I believe the devil made all the Erskines.”\n\n“She’s getting worse all the time. What WILL she say next?” whispered\npoor Felicity.\n\nBut her martyrdom was over at last. The minister appeared in the pulpit\nand Peg subsided into silence. She folded her bare, floury arms over her\nbreast and fastened her black eyes on the young preacher. Her behaviour\nfor the next half-hour was decorum itself, save that when the minister\nprayed that we might all be charitable in judgment Peg ejaculated “Amen”\n several times, loudly and forcibly, somewhat to the discomfiture of the\nYoung man, to whom Peg was a stranger. He opened his eyes, glanced at\nour pew in a startled way, then collected himself and went on.\n\nPeg listened to the sermon, silently and motionlessly, until Mr.\nDavidson was half through. Then she suddenly got on her feet.\n\n“This is too dull for me,” she exclaimed. “I want something more\nexciting.”\n\nMr. Davidson stopped short and Peg marched down the aisle in the midst\nof complete silence. Half way down the aisle she turned around and faced\nthe minister.\n\n“There are so many hypocrites in this church that it isn’t fit for\ndecent people to come to,” she said. “Rather than be such hypocrites as\nmost of you are it would be better for you to go miles into the woods\nand commit suicide.”\n\nWheeling about, she strode to the door. Then she turned for a Parthian\nshot.\n\n“I’ve felt kind of worried for God sometimes, seeing He has so much to\nattend to,” she said, “but I see I needn’t be, so long’s there’s plenty\nof ministers to tell Him what to do.”\n\nWith that Peg shook the dust of Carlisle church from her feet. Poor Mr.\nDavidson resumed his discourse. Old Elder Bayley, whose attention\nan earthquake could not have distracted from the sermon, afterwards\ndeclared that it was an excellent and edifying exhortation, but I doubt\nif anyone else in Carlisle church tasted it much or gained much good\ntherefrom. Certainly we of the King household did not. We could not even\nremember the text when we reached home. Felicity was comfortless.\n\n“Mr. Davidson would be sure to think she belonged to our family when she\nwas in our pew,” she said bitterly. “Oh, I feel as if I could never\nget over such a mortification! Peter, I do wish you wouldn’t go telling\npeople they ought to go to church. It’s all your fault that this\nhappened.”\n\n“Never mind, it will be a good story to tell sometime,” remarked the\nStory Girl with relish.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. THE YANKEE STORM\n\n\nIn an August orchard six children and a grown-up were sitting around the\npulpit stone. The grown-up was Miss Reade, who had been up to give the\ngirls their music lesson and had consented to stay to tea, much to the\nrapture of the said girls, who continued to worship her with unabated\nand romantic ardour. To us, over the golden grasses, came the Story\nGirl, carrying in her hand a single large poppy, like a blood-red\nchalice filled with the wine of August wizardry. She proffered it to\nMiss Reade and, as the latter took it into her singularly slender,\nbeautiful hand, I saw a ring on her third finger. I noticed it, because\nI had heard the girls say that Miss Reade never wore rings, not liking\nthem. It was not a new ring; it was handsome, but of an old-fashioned\ndesign and setting, with a glint of diamonds about a central sapphire.\nLater on, when Miss Reade had gone, I asked the Story Girl if she had\nnoticed the ring. She nodded, but seemed disinclined to say more about\nit.\n\n“Look here, Sara,” I said, “there’s something about that ring--something\nyou know.”\n\n“I told you once there was a story growing but you would have to wait\nuntil it was fully grown,” she answered.\n\n“Is Miss Reade going to marry anybody--anybody we know?” I persisted.\n\n“Curiosity killed a cat,” observed the Story Girl coolly. “Miss Reade\nhasn’t told me that she was going to marry anybody. You will find out\nall that is good for you to know in due time.”\n\nWhen the Story Girl put on grown-up airs I did not like her so well, and\nI dropped the subject with a dignity that seemed to amuse her mightily.\n\nShe had been away for a week, visiting cousins in Markdale, and she had\ncome home with a new treasure-trove of stories, most of which she had\nheard from the old sailors of Markdale Harbour. She had promised that\nmorning to tell us of “the most tragic event that had ever been known on\nthe north shore,” and we now reminded her of her promise.\n\n“Some call it the ‘Yankee Storm,’ and others the ‘American Gale,’” she\nbegan, sitting down by Miss Reade and beaming, because the latter\nput her arm around her waist. “It happened nearly forty years ago, in\nOctober of 1851. Old Mr. Coles at the Harbour told me all about it. He\nwas a young man then and he says he can never forget that dreadful time.\nYou know in those days hundreds of American fishing schooners used to\ncome down to the Gulf every summer to fish mackerel. On one beautiful\nSaturday night in this October of 1851, more than one hundred of these\nvessels could be counted from Markdale Capes. By Monday night more than\nseventy of them had been destroyed. Those which had escaped were mostly\nthose which went into harbour Saturday night, to keep Sunday. Mr. Coles\nsays the rest stayed outside and fished all day Sunday, same as through\nthe week, and HE says the storm was a judgment on them for doing it. But\nhe admits that even some of them got into harbour later on and escaped,\nso it’s hard to know what to think. But it is certain that on Sunday\nnight there came up a sudden and terrible storm--the worst, Mr. Coles\nsays, that has ever been known on the north shore. It lasted for two\ndays and scores of vessels were driven ashore and completely wrecked.\nThe crews of most of the vessels that went ashore on the sand beaches\nwere saved, but those that struck on the rocks went to pieces and all\nhands were lost. For weeks after the storm the north shore was strewn\nwith the bodies of drowned men. Think of it! Many of them were unknown\nand unrecognizable, and they were buried in Markdale graveyard. Mr.\nColes says the schoolmaster who was in Markdale then wrote a poem on the\nstorm and Mr. Coles recited the first two verses to me.\n\n\n    “‘Here are the fishers’ hillside graves,\n      The church beside, the woods around,\n      Below, the hollow moaning waves\n      Where the poor fishermen were drowned.\n\n    “‘A sudden tempest the blue welkin tore,\n      The seamen tossed and torn apart\n      Rolled with the seaweed to the shore\n      While landsmen gazed with aching heart.’\n\n\n“Mr. Coles couldn’t remember any more of it. But the saddest of all the\nstories of the Yankee Storm was the one about the Franklin Dexter.\nThe Franklin Dexter went ashore on the Markdale Capes and all on board\nperished, the Captain and three of his brothers among them. These four\nyoung men were the sons of an old man who lived in Portland, Maine, and\nwhen he heard what had happened he came right down to the Island to see\nif he could find their bodies. They had all come ashore and had been\nburied in Markdale graveyard; but he was determined to take them up and\ncarry them home for burial. He said he had promised their mother to take\nher boys home to her and he must do it. So they were taken up and put\non board a sailing vessel at Markdale Harbour to be taken back to Maine,\nwhile the father himself went home on a passenger steamer. The name of\nthe sailing vessel was the Seth Hall, and the captain’s name was Seth\nHall, too. Captain Hall was a dreadfully profane man and used to swear\nblood-curdling oaths. On the night he sailed out of Markdale Harbour the\nold sailors warned him that a storm was brewing and that it would catch\nhim if he did not wait until it was over. The captain had become very\nimpatient because of several delays he had already met with, and he was\nin a furious temper. He swore a wicked oath that he would sail out of\nMarkdale Harbour that night and ‘God Almighty Himself shouldn’t catch\nhim.’ He did sail out of the harbour; and the storm did catch him, and\nthe Seth Hall went down with all hands, the dead and the living finding\na watery grave together. So the poor old mother up in Maine never had\nher boys brought back to her after all. Mr. Coles says it seems as if it\nwere foreordained that they should not rest in a grave, but should lie\nbeneath the waves until the day when the sea gives up its dead.”\n\n\n    “‘They sleep as well beneath that purple tide\n      As others under turf,’”\n\n\nquoted Miss Reade softly. “I am very thankful,” she added, “that I am\nnot one of those whose dear ones ‘go down to the sea in ships.’ It seems\nto me that they have treble their share of this world’s heartache.”\n\n“Uncle Stephen was a sailor and he was drowned,” said Felicity, “and\nthey say it broke Grandmother King’s heart. I don’t see why people can’t\nbe contented on dry land.”\n\nCecily’s tears had been dropping on the autograph quilt square she was\nfaithfully embroidering. She had been diligently collecting names for it\never since the preceding autumn and had a goodly number; but Kitty Marr\nhad one more and this was certainly a fly in Cecily’s ointment.\n\n“Besides, one I’ve got isn’t paid for--Peg Bowen’s,” she lamented, “and\nI don’t suppose it ever will be, for I’ll never dare to ask her for it.”\n\n“I wouldn’t put it on at all,” said Felicity.\n\n“Oh, I don’t dare not to. She’d be sure to find out I didn’t and then\nshe’d be very angry. I wish I could get just one more name and then I’d\nbe contented. But I don’t know of a single person who hasn’t been asked\nalready.”\n\n“Except Mr. Campbell,” said Dan.\n\n“Oh, of course nobody would ask Mr. Campbell. We all know it would be\nof no use. He doesn’t believe in missions at all--in fact, he says he\ndetests the very mention of missions--and he never gives one cent to\nthem.”\n\n“All the same, I think he ought to be asked, so that he wouldn’t have\nthe excuse that nobody DID ask him,” declared Dan.\n\n“Do you really think so, Dan?” asked Cecily earnestly.\n\n“Sure,” said Dan, solemnly. Dan liked to tease even Cecily a wee bit now\nand then.\n\nCecily relapsed into anxious thought, and care sat visibly on her brow\nfor the rest of the day. Next morning she came to me and said:\n\n“Bev, would you like to go for a walk with me this afternoon?”\n\n“Of course,” I replied. “Any particular where?”\n\n“I’m going to see Mr. Campbell and ask him for his name for my square,”\n said Cecily resolutely. “I don’t suppose it will do any good. He\nwouldn’t give anything to the library last summer, you remember, till\nthe Story Girl told him that story about his grandmother. She won’t\ngo with me this time--I don’t know why. I can’t tell a story and I’m\nfrightened to death just to think of going to him. But I believe it is\nmy duty; and besides I would love to get as many names on my square\nas Kitty Marr has. So if you’ll go with me we’ll go this afternoon. I\nsimply COULDN’T go alone.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. A MISSIONARY HEROINE\n\n\nAccordingly, that afternoon we bearded the lion in his den. The road we\ntook was a beautiful one, for we went “cross lots,” and we enjoyed\nit, in spite of the fact that we did not expect the interview with Mr.\nCampbell to be a very pleasant one. To be sure, he had been quite civil\non the occasion of our last call upon him, but the Story Girl had been\nwith us then and had beguiled him into good-humour and generosity by\nthe magic of her voice and personality. We had no such ally now, and Mr.\nCampbell was known to be virulently opposed to missions in any shape or\nform.\n\n“I don’t know whether it would have been any better if I could have\nput on my good clothes,” said Cecily, with a rueful glance at her print\ndress, which, though neat and clean, was undeniably faded and RATHER\nshort and tight. “The Story Girl said it would, and I wanted to, but\nmother wouldn’t let me. She said it was all nonsense, and Mr. Campbell\nwould never notice what I had on.”\n\n“It’s my opinion that Mr. Campbell notices a good deal more than you’d\nthink for,” I said sagely.\n\n“Well, I wish our call was over,” sighed Cecily. “I can’t tell you how I\ndread it.”\n\n“Now, see here, Sis,” I said cheerfully, “let’s not think about it\ntill we get there. It’ll only spoil our walk and do no good. Let’s just\nforget it and enjoy ourselves.”\n\n“I’ll try,” agreed Cecily, “but it’s ever so much easier to preach than\nto practise.”\n\nOur way lay first over a hill top, gallantly plumed with golden rod,\nwhere cloud shadows drifted over us like a gypsying crew. Carlisle, in\nall its ripely tinted length and breadth, lay below us, basking in the\nAugust sunshine, that spilled over the brim of the valley to the far-off\nMarkdale Harbour, cupped in its harvest-golden hills.\n\nThen came a little valley overgrown with the pale purple bloom of\nthistles and elusively haunted with their perfume. You say that thistles\nhave no perfume? Go you to a brook hollow where they grow some late\nsummer twilight at dewfall; and on the still air that rises suddenly to\nmeet you will come a waft of faint, aromatic fragrance, wondrously sweet\nand evasive, the distillation of that despised thistle bloom.\n\nBeyond this the path wound through a forest of fir, where a wood wind\nwove its murmurous spell and a wood brook dimpled pellucidly among the\nshadows--the dear, companionable, elfin shadows--that lurked under the\nlow growing boughs. Along the edges of that winding path grew banks\nof velvet green moss, starred with clusters of pigeon berries. Pigeon\nberries are not to be eaten. They are woolly, tasteless things. But they\nare to be looked at in their glowing scarlet. They are the jewels with\nwhich the forest of cone-bearers loves to deck its brown breast. Cecily\ngathered some and pinned them on hers, but they did not become her.\nI thought how witching the Story Girl’s brown curls would have looked\ntwined with those brilliant clusters. Perhaps Cecily was thinking of it,\ntoo, for she presently said,\n\n“Bev, don’t you think the Story Girl is changing somehow?”\n\n“There are times--just times--when she seems to belong more among the\ngrown-ups than among us,” I said, reluctantly, “especially when she puts\non her bridesmaid dress.”\n\n“Well, she’s the oldest of us, and when you come to think of it, she’s\nfifteen,--that’s almost grown-up,” sighed Cecily. Then she added, with\nsudden vehemence, “I hate the thought of any of us growing up. Felicity\nsays she just longs to be grown-up, but I don’t, not a bit. I wish I\ncould just stay a little girl for ever--and have you and Felix and\nall the others for playmates right along. I don’t know how it is--but\nwhenever I think of being grown-up I seem to feel tired.”\n\nSomething about Cecily’s speech--or the wistful look that had crept into\nher sweet brown eyes--made me feel vaguely uncomfortable; I was glad\nthat we were at the end of our journey, with Mr. Campbell’s big house\nbefore us, and his dog sitting gravely at the veranda steps.\n\n“Oh, dear,” said Cecily, with a shiver, “I’d been hoping that dog\nwouldn’t be around.”\n\n“He never bites,” I assured her.\n\n“Perhaps he doesn’t, but he always looks as if he was going to,”\n rejoined Cecily.\n\nThe dog continued to look, and, as we edged gingerly past him and up\nthe veranda steps, he turned his head and kept on looking. What with\nMr. Campbell before us and the dog behind, Cecily was trembling with\nnervousness; but perhaps it was as well that the dour brute was there,\nelse I verily believe she would have turned and fled shamelessly when we\nheard steps in the hall.\n\nIt was Mr. Campbell’s housekeeper who came to the door, however; she\nushered us pleasantly into the sitting-room where Mr. Campbell was\nreading. He laid down his book with a slight frown and said nothing at\nall in response to our timid “good afternoon.” But after we had sat for\na few minutes in wretched silence, wishing ourselves a thousand miles\naway, he said, with a chuckle,\n\n“Well, is it the school library again?”\n\nCecily had remarked as we were coming that what she dreaded most of all\nwas introducing the subject; but Mr. Campbell had given her a splendid\nopening, and she plunged wildly in at once, rattling her explanation off\nnervously with trembling voice and flushed cheeks.\n\n“No, it’s our Mission Band autograph quilt, Mr. Campbell. There are to\nbe as many squares in it as there are members in the Band. Each one has\na square and is collecting names for it. If you want to have your name\non the quilt you pay five cents, and if you want to have it right in the\nround spot in the middle of the square you must pay ten cents. Then when\nwe have got all the names we can we will embroider them on the squares.\nThe money is to go to the little girl our Band is supporting in Korea. I\nheard that nobody had asked you, so I thought perhaps you would give me\nyour name for my square.”\n\nMr. Campbell drew his black brows together in a scowl.\n\n“Stuff and nonsense!” he exclaimed angrily. “I don’t believe in Foreign\nMissions--don’t believe in them at all. I never give a cent to them.”\n\n“Five cents isn’t a very large sum,” said Cecily earnestly.\n\nMr. Campbell’s scowl disappeared and he laughed.\n\n“It wouldn’t break me,” he admitted, “but it’s the principle of the\nthing. And as for that Mission Band of yours, if it wasn’t for the fun\nyou get out of it, catch one of you belonging. You don’t really care a\nrap more for the heathen than I do.”\n\n“Oh, we do,” protested Cecily. “We do think of all the poor little\nchildren in Korea, and we like to think we are helping them, if it’s\never so little. We ARE in earnest, Mr. Campbell--indeed we are.”\n\n“Don’t believe it--don’t believe a word of it,” said Mr. Campbell\nimpolitely. “You’ll do things that are nice and interesting. You’ll get\nup concerts, and chase people about for autographs and give money your\nparents give you and that doesn’t cost you either time or labour. But\nyou wouldn’t do anything you disliked for the heathen children--you\nwouldn’t make any real sacrifice for them--catch you!”\n\n“Indeed we would,” cried Cecily, forgetting her timidity in her zeal. “I\njust wish I had a chance to prove it to you.”\n\n“You do, eh? Come, now, I’ll take you at your word. I’ll test you.\nTomorrow is Communion Sunday and the church will be full of folks and\nthey’ll all have their best clothes on. If you go to church tomorrow in\nthe very costume you have on at present, without telling anyone why you\ndo so, until it is all over, I’ll give you--why, I vow I’ll give you\nfive dollars for that quilt of yours.”\n\nPoor Cecily! To go to church in a faded print dress, with a shabby\nlittle old sun-hat and worn shoes! It was very cruel of Mr. Campbell.\n\n“I--I don’t think mother would let me,” she faltered.\n\nHer tormentor smiled grimly.\n\n“It’s not hard to find some excuse,” he said sarcastically.\n\nCecily crimsoned and sat up facing Mr. Campbell spunkily.\n\n“It’s NOT an excuse,” she said. “If mother will let me go to church like\nthis I’ll go. But I’ll have to tell HER why, Mr. Campbell, because I’m\ncertain she’d never let me if I didn’t.”\n\n“Oh, you can tell all your own family,” said Mr. Campbell, “but\nremember, none of them must tell it outside until Sunday is over. If\nthey do, I’ll be sure to find it out and then our bargain is off. If\nI see you in church tomorrow, dressed as you are now, I’ll give you my\nname and five dollars. But I won’t see you. You’ll shrink when you’ve\nhad time to think it over.”\n\n“I sha’n’t,” said Cecily resolutely.\n\n“Well, we’ll see. And now come out to the barn with me. I’ve got the\nprettiest little drove of calves out there you ever saw. I want you to\nsee them.”\n\nMr. Campbell took us all over his barns and was very affable. He had\nbeautiful horses, cows and sheep, and I enjoyed seeing them. I don’t\nthink Cecily did, however. She was very quiet and even Mr. Campbell’s\nhandsome new span of dappled grays failed to arouse any enthusiasm in\nher. She was already in bitter anticipation living over the martyrdom\nof the morrow. On the way home she asked me seriously if I thought Mr.\nCampbell would go to heaven when he died.\n\n“Of course he will,” I said. “Isn’t he a member of the church?”\n\n“Oh, yes, but I can’t imagine him fitting into heaven. You know he isn’t\nreally fond of anything but live stock.”\n\n“He’s fond of teasing people, I guess,” I responded. “Are you really\ngoing to church to-morrow in that dress, Sis?”\n\n“If mother’ll let me I’ll have to,” said poor Cecily. “I won’t let Mr.\nCampbell triumph over me. And I DO want to have as many names as Kitty\nhas. And I DO want to help the poor little Korean children. But it will\nbe simply dreadful. I don’t know whether I hope mother will or not.”\n\nI did not believe she would, but Aunt Janet sometimes could be depended\non for the unexpected. She laughed and told Cecily she could please\nherself. Felicity was in a rage over it, and declared SHE wouldn’t go to\nchurch if Cecily went in such a rig. Dan sarcastically inquired if all\nshe went to church for was to show off her fine clothes and look at\nother people’s; then they quarrelled and didn’t speak to each other for\ntwo days, much to Cecily’s distress.\n\nI suspect poor Sis wished devoutly that it might rain the next day; but\nit was gloriously fine. We were all waiting in the orchard for the Story\nGirl who had not begun to dress for church until Cecily and Felicity\nwere ready. Felicity was her prettiest in flower-trimmed hat, crisp\nmuslin, floating ribbons and trim black slippers. Poor Cecily stood\nbeside her mute and pale, in her faded school garb and heavy copper-toed\nboots. But her face, if pale, was very determined. Cecily, having put\nher hand to the plough, was not of those who turn back.\n\n“You do look just awful,” said Felicity. “I don’t care--I’m going to\nsit in Uncle James’ pew. I WON’T sit with you. There will be so many\nstrangers there, and all the Markdale people, and what will they think\nof you? Some of them will never know the reason, either.”\n\n“I wish the Story Girl would hurry,” was all poor Cecily said. “We’re\ngoing to be late. It wouldn’t have been quite so hard if I could have\ngot there before anyone and slipped quietly into our pew.”\n\n“Here she comes at last,” said Dan. “Why--what’s she got on?”\n\nThe Story Girl joined us with a quizzical smile on her face. Dan\nwhistled. Cecily’s pale cheeks flushed with understanding and gratitude.\nThe Story Girl wore her school print dress and hat also, and was\ngloveless and heavy shod.\n\n“You’re not going to have to go through this all alone, Cecily,” she\nsaid.\n\n“Oh, it won’t be half so hard now,” said Cecily, with a long breath of\nrelief.\n\nI fancy it was hard enough even then. The Story Girl did not care a\nwhit, but Cecily rather squirmed under the curious glances that were\ncast at her. She afterwards told me that she really did not think she\ncould have endured it if she had been alone.\n\nMr. Campbell met us under the elms in the churchyard, with a twinkle in\nhis eye.\n\n“Well, you did it, Miss,” he said to Cecily, “but you should have been\nalone. That was what I meant. I suppose you think you’ve cheated me\nnicely.”\n\n“No, she doesn’t,” spoke up the Story Girl undauntedly. “She was all\ndressed and ready to come before she knew I was going to dress the same\nway. So she kept her bargain faithfully, Mr. Campbell, and I think you\nwere cruel to make her do it.”\n\n“You do, eh? Well, well, I hope you’ll forgive me. I didn’t think she’d\ndo it--I was sure feminine vanity would win the day over missionary\nzeal. It seems it didn’t--though how much was pure missionary zeal and\nhow much just plain King spunk I’m doubtful. I’ll keep my promise, Miss.\nYou shall have your five dollars, and mind you put my name in the round\nspace. No five-cent corners for me.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. A TANTALIZING REVELATION\n\n\n“I shall have something to tell you in the orchard this evening,” said\nthe Story Girl at breakfast one morning. Her eyes were very bright and\nexcited. She looked as if she had not slept a great deal. She had spent\nthe previous evening with Miss Reade and had not returned until the rest\nof us were in bed. Miss Reade had finished giving music lessons and was\ngoing home in a few days. Cecily and Felicity were in despair over this\nand mourned as those without comfort. But the Story Girl, who had been\neven more devoted to Miss Reade than either of them, had not, as I\nnoticed, expressed any regret and seemed to be very cheerful over the\nwhole matter.\n\n“Why can’t you tell it now?” asked Felicity.\n\n“Because the evening is the nicest time to tell things in. I only\nmentioned it now so that you would have something interesting to look\nforward to all day.”\n\n“Is it about Miss Reade?” asked Cecily.\n\n“Never mind.”\n\n“I’ll bet she’s going to be married,” I exclaimed, remembering the ring.\n\n“Is she?” cried Felicity and Cecily together.\n\nThe Story Girl threw an annoyed glance at me. She did not like to have\nher dramatic announcements forestalled.\n\n“I don’t say that it is about Miss Reade or that it isn’t. You must just\nwait till the evening.”\n\n“I wonder what it is,” speculated Cecily, as the Story Girl left the\nroom.\n\n“I don’t believe it’s much of anything,” said Felicity, beginning to\nclear away the breakfast dishes. “The Story Girl always likes to make so\nmuch out of so little. Anyhow, I don’t believe Miss Reade is going to be\nmarried. She hasn’t any beaus around here and Mrs. Armstrong says\nshe’s sure she doesn’t correspond with anybody. Besides, if she was she\nwouldn’t be likely to tell the Story Girl.”\n\n“Oh, she might. They’re such friends, you know,” said Cecily.\n\n“Miss Reade is no better friends with her than she is with me and you,”\n retorted Felicity.\n\n“No, but sometimes it seems to me that she’s a different kind of friend\nwith the Story Girl than she is with me and you,” reflected Cecily. “I\ncan’t just explain what I mean.”\n\n“No wonder. Such nonsense,” sniffed Felicity. “It’s only some girl’s\nsecret, anyway,” said Dan, loftily. “I don’t feel much interest in it.”\n\nBut he was on hand with the rest of us that evening, interest or no\ninterest, in Uncle Stephen’s Walk, where the ripening apples were\nbeginning to glow like jewels among the boughs.\n\n“Now, are you going to tell us your news?” asked Felicity impatiently.\n\n“Miss Reade IS going to be married,” said the Story Girl. “She told me\nso last night. She is going to be married in a fortnight’s time.”\n\n“Who to?” exclaimed the girls.\n\n“To”--the Story Girl threw a defiant glance at me as if to say, “You\ncan’t spoil the surprise of THIS, anyway,”--“to--the Awkward Man.”\n\nFor a few moments amazement literally held us dumb.\n\n“You’re not in earnest, Sara Stanley?” gasped Felicity at last.\n\n“Indeed I am. I thought you’d be astonished. But I wasn’t. I’ve\nsuspected it all summer, from little things I’ve noticed. Don’t you\nremember that evening last spring when I went a piece with Miss Reade\nand told you when I came back that a story was growing? I guessed it\nfrom the way the Awkward Man looked at her when I stopped to speak to\nhim over his garden fence.”\n\n“But--the Awkward Man!” said Felicity helplessly. “It doesn’t seem\npossible. Did Miss Reade tell you HERSELF?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I suppose it must be true then. But how did it ever come about? He’s\nSO shy and awkward. How did he ever manage to get up enough spunk to ask\nher to marry him?”\n\n“Maybe she asked him,” suggested Dan.\n\nThe Story Girl looked as if she might tell if she would.\n\n“I believe that WAS the way of it,” I said, to draw her on.\n\n“Not exactly,” she said reluctantly. “I know all about it but I can’t\ntell you. I guessed part from things I’ve seen--and Miss Reade told me a\ngood deal--and the Awkward Man himself told me his side of it as we came\nhome last night. I met him just as I left Mr. Armstrong’s and we were\ntogether as far as his house. It was dark and he just talked on as if he\nwere talking to himself--I think he forgot I was there at all, once\nhe got started. He has never been shy or awkward with me, but he never\ntalked as he did last night.”\n\n“You might tell us what he said,” urged Cecily. “We’d never tell.”\n\nThe Story Girl shook her head.\n\n“No, I can’t. You wouldn’t understand. Besides, I couldn’t tell it just\nright. It’s one of the things that are hardest to tell. I’d spoil it if\nI told it--now. Perhaps some day I’ll be able to tell it properly. It’s\nvery beautiful--but it might sound very ridiculous if it wasn’t told\njust exactly the right way.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean, and I don’t believe you know yourself,”\n said Felicity pettishly. “All that I can make out is that Miss Reade is\ngoing to marry Jasper Dale, and I don’t like the idea one bit. She is\nso beautiful and sweet. I thought she’d marry some dashing young man.\nJasper Dale must be nearly twenty years older than her--and he’s so\nqueer and shy--and such a hermit.”\n\n“Miss Reade is perfectly happy,” said the Story Girl. “She thinks the\nAwkward Man is lovely--and so he is. You don’t know him, but I do.”\n\n“Well, you needn’t put on such airs about it,” sniffed Felicity.\n\n“I am not putting on any airs. But it’s true. Miss Reade and I are the\nonly people in Carlisle who really know the Awkward Man. Nobody else\never got behind his shyness to find out just what sort of a man he is.”\n\n“When are they to be married?” asked Felicity.\n\n“In a fortnight’s time. And then they are coming right back to live at\nGolden Milestone. Won’t it be lovely to have Miss Reade always so near\nus?”\n\n“I wonder what she’ll think about the mystery of Golden Milestone,”\n remarked Felicity.\n\nGolden Milestone was the beautiful name the Awkward Man had given his\nhome; and there was a mystery about it, as readers of the first volume\nof these chronicles will recall.\n\n“She knows all about the mystery and thinks it perfectly lovely--and so\ndo I,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“Do YOU know the secret of the locked room?” cried Cecily.\n\n“Yes, the Awkward Man told me all about it last night. I told you I’d\nfind out the mystery some time.”\n\n“And what is it?”\n\n“I can’t tell you that either.”\n\n“I think you’re hateful and mean,” exclaimed Felicity. “It hasn’t\nanything to do with Miss Reade, so I think you might tell us.”\n\n“It has something to do with Miss Reade. It’s all about her.”\n\n“Well, I don’t see how that can be when the Awkward Man never saw or\nheard of Miss Reade until she came to Carlisle in the spring,” said\nFelicity incredulously, “and he’s had that locked room for years.”\n\n“I can’t explain it to you--but it’s just as I’ve said,” responded the\nStory Girl.\n\n“Well, it’s a very queer thing,” retorted Felicity.\n\n“The name in the books in the room was Alice--and Miss Reade’s name is\nAlice,” marvelled Cecily. “Did he know her before she came here?”\n\n“Mrs. Griggs says that room has been locked for ten years. Ten years ago\nMiss Reade was just a little girl of ten. SHE couldn’t be the Alice of\nthe books,” argued Felicity.\n\n“I wonder if she’ll wear the blue silk dress,” said Sara Ray.\n\n“And what will she do about the picture, if it isn’t hers?” added\nCecily.\n\n“The picture couldn’t be hers, or Mrs. Griggs would have known her for\nthe same when she came to Carlisle,” said Felix.\n\n“I’m going to stop wondering about it,” exclaimed Felicity crossly,\naggravated by the amused smile with which the Story Girl was listening\nto the various speculations. “I think Sara is just as mean as mean when\nshe won’t tell us.”\n\n“I can’t,” repeated the Story Girl patiently.\n\n“You said one time you had an idea who ‘Alice’ was,” I said. “Was your\nidea anything like the truth?”\n\n“Yes, I guessed pretty nearly right.”\n\n“Do you suppose they’ll keep the room locked after they are married?”\n asked Cecily.\n\n“Oh, no. I can tell you that much. It is to be Miss Reade’s own\nparticular sitting room.”\n\n“Why, then, perhaps we’ll see it some time ourselves, when we go to see\nMiss Reade,” cried Cecily.\n\n“I’d be frightened to go into it,” confessed Sara Ray. “I hate things\nwith mysteries. They always make me nervous.”\n\n“I love them. They’re so exciting,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“Just think, this will be the second wedding of people we know,”\n reflected Cecily. “Isn’t that interesting?”\n\n“I only hope the next thing won’t be a funeral,” remarked Sara Ray\ngloomily. “There were three lighted lamps on our kitchen table last\nnight, and Judy Pineau says that’s a sure sign of a funeral.”\n\n“Well, there are funerals going on all the time,” said Dan.\n\n“But it means the funeral of somebody you know. I don’t believe in\nit--MUCH--but Judy says she’s seen it come true time and again. I hope\nif it does it won’t be anybody we know very well. But I hope it’ll be\nsomebody I know a LITTLE, because then I might get to the funeral. I’d\njust love to go to a funeral.”\n\n“That’s a dreadful thing to say,” commented Felicity in a shocked tone.\n\nSara Ray looked bewildered.\n\n“I don’t see what is dreadful in it,” she protested.\n\n“People don’t go to funerals for the fun of it,” said Felicity severely.\n“And you just as good as said you hoped somebody you knew would die so\nyou’d get to the funeral.”\n\n“No, no, I didn’t. I didn’t mean that AT ALL, Felicity. I don’t want\nanybody to die; but what I meant was, if anybody I knew HAD to die there\nmight be a chance to go to the funeral. I’ve never been to a single\nfuneral yet, and it must be so interesting.”\n\n“Well, don’t mix up talk about funerals with talk about weddings,” said\nFelicity. “It isn’t lucky. I think Miss Reade is simply throwing herself\naway, but I hope she’ll be happy. And I hope the Awkward Man will manage\nto get married without making some awful blunder, but it’s more than I\nexpect.”\n\n“The ceremony is to be very private,” said the Story Girl.\n\n“I’d like to see them the day they appear out in church,” chuckled Dan.\n“How’ll he ever manage to bring her in and show her into the pew? I’ll\nbet he’ll go in first--or tramp on her dress--or fall over his feet.”\n\n“Maybe he won’t go to church at all the first Sunday and she’ll have to\ngo alone,” said Peter. “That happened in Markdale. A man was too bashful\nto go to church the first time after getting married, and his wife went\nalone till he got used to the idea.”\n\n“They may do things like that in Markdale but that is not the way people\nbehave in Carlisle,” said Felicity loftily.\n\nSeeing the Story Girl slipping away with a disapproving face I joined\nher.\n\n“What is the matter, Sara?” I asked.\n\n“I hate to hear them talking like that about Miss Reade and Mr. Dale,”\n she answered vehemently. “It’s really all so beautiful--but they make it\nseem silly and absurd, somehow.”\n\n“You might tell me all about it, Sara,” I insinuated. “I wouldn’t\ntell--and I’d understand.”\n\n“Yes, I think you would,” she said thoughtfully. “But I can’t tell it\neven to you because I can’t tell it well enough yet. I’ve a feeling that\nthere’s only one way to tell it--and I don’t know the way yet. Some day\nI’ll know it--and then I’ll tell you, Bev.”\n\nLong, long after she kept her word. Forty years later I wrote to her,\nacross the leagues of land and sea that divided us, and told her that\nJasper Dale was dead; and I reminded her of her old promise and asked\nits fulfilment. In reply she sent me the written love story of Jasper\nDale and Alice Reade. Now, when Alice sleeps under the whispering elms\nof the old Carlisle churchyard, beside the husband of her youth, that\nstory may be given, in all its old-time sweetness, to the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. THE LOVE STORY OF THE AWKWARD MAN\n\n(Written by the Story Girl)\n\n\nJasper Dale lived alone in the old homestead which he had named Golden\nMilestone. In Carlisle this giving one’s farm a name was looked upon as\na piece of affectation; but if a place must be named why not give it\na sensible name with some meaning to it? Why Golden Milestone, when\nPinewood or Hillslope or, if you wanted to be very fanciful, Ivy Lodge,\nmight be had for the taking?\n\nHe had lived alone at Golden Milestone since his mother’s death; he had\nbeen twenty then and he was close upon forty now, though he did not look\nit. But neither could it be said that he looked young; he had never at\nany time looked young with common youth; there had always been something\nin his appearance that stamped him as different from the ordinary run\nof men, and, apart from his shyness, built up an intangible, invisible\nbarrier between him and his kind. He had lived all his life in Carlisle;\nand all the Carlisle people knew of or about him--although they thought\nthey knew everything--was that he was painfully, abnormally shy. He\nnever went anywhere except to church; he never took part in Carlisle’s\nsimple social life; even with most men he was distant and reserved; as\nfor women, he never spoke to or looked at them; if one spoke to him,\neven if she were a matronly old mother in Israel, he was at once in an\nagony of painful blushes. He had no friends in the sense of companions;\nto all outward appearance his life was solitary and devoid of any human\ninterest.\n\nHe had no housekeeper; but his old house, furnished as it had been in\nhis mother’s lifetime, was cleanly and daintily kept. The quaint rooms\nwere as free from dust and disorder as a woman could have had them. This\nwas known, because Jasper Dale occasionally had his hired man’s wife,\nMrs. Griggs, in to scrub for him. On the morning she was expected he\nbetook himself to woods and fields, returning only at night-fall. During\nhis absence Mrs. Griggs was frankly wont to explore the house from\ncellar to attic, and her report of its condition was always the\nsame--“neat as wax.” To be sure, there was one room that was always\nlocked against her, the west gable, looking out on the garden and the\nhill of pines beyond. But Mrs. Griggs knew that in the lifetime of\nJasper Dale’s mother it had been unfurnished. She supposed it still\nremained so, and felt no especial curiosity concerning it, though she\nalways tried the door.\n\nJasper Dale had a good farm, well cultivated; he had a large garden\nwhere he worked most of his spare time in summer; it was supposed that\nhe read a great deal, since the postmistress declared that he was always\ngetting books and magazines by mail. He seemed well contented with his\nexistence and people let him alone, since that was the greatest kindness\nthey could do him. It was unsupposable that he would ever marry; nobody\never had supposed it.\n\n“Jasper Dale never so much as THOUGHT about a woman,” Carlisle oracles\ndeclared. Oracles, however, are not always to be trusted.\n\nOne day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious\nstory, which she diligently spread far and wide. It made a good deal\nof talk, but people, although they listened eagerly, and wondered and\nquestioned, were rather incredulous about it. They thought Mrs. Griggs\nmust be drawing considerably upon her imagination; there were not\nlacking those who declared that she had invented the whole account,\nsince her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned.\n\nMrs. Griggs’s story was as follows:--\n\nOne day she found the door of the west gable unlocked. She went in,\nexpecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends. Instead\nshe found herself in a finely furnished room. Delicate lace curtains\nhung before the small, square, broad-silled windows. The walls were\nadorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs. Griggs could\nappreciate. There was a bookcase between the windows filled with\nchoicely bound books. Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty\nwork-basket on it. By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors\nand a silver thimble. A wicker rocker, comfortable with silk cushions,\nwas near it. Above the bookcase a woman’s picture hung--a water-colour,\nif Mrs. Griggs had but known it--representing a pale, very sweet face,\nwith large, dark eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of\nblack, lustrous hair. Just beneath the picture, on the top shelf of the\nbookcase, was a vaseful of flowers. Another vaseful stood on the table\nbeside the basket.\n\nAll this was astonishing enough. But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely\nwas the fact that a woman’s dress was hanging over a chair before the\nmirror--a pale blue, silken affair. And on the floor beside it were two\nlittle blue satin slippers!\n\nGood Mrs. Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly\nexplored it, even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be\na tea-gown--wrapper, she called it. But she found nothing to throw any\nlight on the mystery. The fact that the simple name “Alice” was written\non the fly-leaves of all the books only deepened it, for it was a name\nunknown in the Dale family. In this puzzled state she was obliged to\ndepart, nor did she ever find the door unlocked again; and, discovering\nthat people thought she was romancing when she talked about the\nmysterious west gable at Golden Milestone, she indignantly held her\npeace concerning the whole affair.\n\nBut Mrs. Griggs had told no more than the simple truth. Jasper Dale,\nunder all his shyness and aloofness, possessed a nature full of delicate\nromance and poesy, which, denied expression in the common ways of life,\nbloomed out in the realm of fancy and imagination. Left alone, just when\nthe boy’s nature was deepening into the man’s, he turned to this ideal\nkingdom for all he believed the real world could never give him. Love--a\nstrange, almost mystical love--played its part here for him. He shadowed\nforth to himself the vision of a woman, loving and beloved; he cherished\nit until it became almost as real to him as his own personality and he\ngave this dream woman the name he liked best--Alice. In fancy he walked\nand talked with her, spoke words of love to her, and heard words of love\nin return. When he came from work at the close of day she met him at his\nthreshold in the twilight--a strange, fair, starry shape, as elusive and\nspiritual as a blossom reflected in a pool by moonlight--with welcome on\nher lips and in her eyes.\n\nOne day, when he was in Charlottetown on business, he had been struck by\na picture in the window of a store. It was strangely like the woman of\nhis dream love. He went in, awkward and embarrassed, and bought it. When\nhe took it home he did not know where to put it. It was out of place\namong the dim old engravings of bewigged portraits and conventional\nlandscapes on the walls of Golden Milestone. As he pondered the matter\nin his garden that evening he had an inspiration. The sunset, flaming on\nthe windows of the west gable, kindled them into burning rose. Amid the\nsplendour he fancied Alice’s fair face peeping archly down at him from\nthe room. The inspiration came then. It should be her room; he would fit\nit up for her; and her picture should hang there.\n\nHe was all summer carrying out his plan. Nobody must know or suspect,\nso he must go slowly and secretly. One by one the furnishings were\npurchased and brought home under cover of darkness. He arranged them\nwith his own hands. He bought the books he thought she would like best\nand wrote her name in them; he got the little feminine knick-knacks of\nbasket and thimble. Finally he saw in a store a pale blue tea-gown and\nthe satin slippers. He had always fancied her as dressed in blue. He\nbought them and took them home to her room. Thereafter it was sacred to\nher; he always knocked on its door before he entered; he kept it sweet\nwith fresh flowers; he sat there in the purple summer evenings and\ntalked aloud to her or read his favourite books to her. In his fancy she\nsat opposite to him in her rocker, clad in the trailing blue gown, with\nher head leaning on one slender hand, as white as a twilight star.\n\nBut Carlisle people knew nothing of this--would have thought him tinged\nwith mild lunacy if they had known. To them, he was just the shy, simple\nfarmer he appeared. They never knew or guessed at the real Jasper Dale.\n\nOne spring Alice Reade came to teach music in Carlisle. Her pupils\nworshipped her, but the grown people thought she was rather too distant\nand reserved. They had been used to merry, jolly girls who joined\neagerly in the social life of the place. Alice Reade held herself aloof\nfrom it--not disdainfully, but as one to whom these things were of small\nimportance. She was very fond of books and solitary rambles; she was\nnot at all shy but she was as sensitive as a flower; and after a time\nCarlisle people were content to let her live her own life and no longer\nresented her unlikeness to themselves.\n\nShe boarded with the Armstrongs, who lived beyond Golden Milestone\naround the hill of pines. Until the snow disappeared she went out to the\nmain road by the long Armstrong lane; but when spring came she was wont\nto take a shorter way, down the pine hill, across the brook, past Jasper\nDale’s garden, and out through his lane. And one day, as she went by,\nJasper Dale was working in his garden.\n\nHe was on his knees in a corner, setting out a bunch of roots--an\nunsightly little tangle of rainbow possibilities. It was a still spring\nmorning; the world was green with young leaves; a little wind blew down\nfrom the pines and lost itself willingly among the budding delights of\nthe garden. The grass opened eyes of blue violets. The sky was high\nand cloudless, turquoise-blue, shading off into milkiness on the far\nhorizons. Birds were singing along the brook valley. Rollicking robins\nwere whistling joyously in the pines. Jasper Dale’s heart was filled to\nover-flowing with a realization of all the virgin loveliness around him;\nthe feeling in his soul had the sacredness of a prayer. At this moment\nhe looked up and saw Alice Reade.\n\nShe was standing outside the garden fence, in the shadow of a great pine\ntree, looking not at him, for she was unaware of his presence, but\nat the virginal bloom of the plum trees in a far corner, with all her\ndelight in it outblossoming freely in her face. For a moment Jasper Dale\nbelieved that his dream love had taken visible form before him. She was\nlike--so like; not in feature, perhaps, but in grace and colouring--the\ngrace of a slender, lissome form and the colouring of cloudy hair and\nwistful, dark gray eyes, and curving red mouth; and more than all, she\nwas like her in expression--in the subtle revelation of personality\nexhaling from her like perfume from a flower. It was as if his own had\ncome to him at last and his whole soul suddenly leaped out to meet and\nwelcome her.\n\nThen her eyes fell upon him and the spell was broken. Jasper remained\nkneeling mutely there, shy man once more, crimson with blushes, a\nstrange, almost pitiful creature in his abject confusion. A little smile\nflickered about the delicate corners of her mouth, but she turned and\nwalked swiftly away down the lane.\n\nJasper looked after her with a new, painful sense of loss and\nloveliness. It had been agony to feel her conscious eyes upon him, but\nhe realized now that there had been a strange sweetness in it, too. It\nwas still greater pain to watch her going from him.\n\nHe thought she must be the new music teacher but he did not even know\nher name. She had been dressed in blue, too--a pale, dainty blue; but\nthat was of course; he had known she must wear it; and he was sure her\nname must be Alice. When, later on, he discovered that it was, he felt\nno surprise.\n\nHe carried some mayflowers up to the west gable and put them under the\npicture. But the charm had gone out of the tribute; and looking at the\npicture, he thought how scant was the justice it did her. Her face\nwas so much sweeter, her eyes so much softer, her hair so much more\nlustrous. The soul of his love had gone from the room and from the\npicture and from his dreams. When he tried to think of the Alice he\nloved he saw, not the shadowy spirit occupant of the west gable, but the\nyoung girl who had stood under the pine, beautiful with the beauty of\nmoonlight, of starshine on still water, of white, wind-swayed flowers\ngrowing in silent, shadowy places. He did not then realize what this\nmeant: had he realized it he would have suffered bitterly; as it was\nhe felt only a vague discomfort--a curious sense of loss and gain\ncommingled.\n\nHe saw her again that afternoon on her way home. She did not pause by\nthe garden but walked swiftly past. Thereafter, every day for a week he\nwatched unseen to see her pass his home. Once a little child was with\nher, clinging to her hand. No child had ever before had any part in the\nshy man’s dream life. But that night in the twilight the vision of\nthe rocking-chair was a girl in a blue print dress, with a little,\ngolden-haired shape at her knee--a shape that lisped and prattled and\ncalled her “mother;” and both of them were his.\n\nIt was the next day that he failed for the first time to put flowers\nin the west gable. Instead, he cut a loose handful of daffodils and,\nlooking furtively about him as if committing a crime, he laid them\nacross the footpath under the pine. She must pass that way; her feet\nwould crush them if she failed to see them. Then he slipped back into\nhis garden, half exultant, half repentant. From a safe retreat he saw\nher pass by and stoop to lift his flowers. Thereafter he put some in the\nsame place every day.\n\nWhen Alice Reade saw the flowers she knew at once who had put them\nthere, and divined that they were for her. She lifted them tenderly in\nmuch surprise and pleasure. She had heard all about Jasper Dale and his\nshyness; but before she had heard about him she had seen him in church\nand liked him. She thought his face and his dark blue eyes beautiful;\nshe even liked the long brown hair that Carlisle people laughed at. That\nhe was quite different from other people she had understood at once, but\nshe thought the difference in his favour. Perhaps her sensitive nature\ndivined and responded to the beauty in his. At least, in her eyes Jasper\nDale was never a ridiculous figure.\n\nWhen she heard the story of the west gable, which most people\ndisbelieved, she believed it, although she did not understand it. It\ninvested the shy man with interest and romance. She felt that she would\nhave liked, out of no impertinent curiosity, to solve the mystery; she\nbelieved that it contained the key to his character.\n\nThereafter, every day she found flowers under the pine tree; she wished\nto see Jasper to thank him, unaware that he watched her daily from the\nscreen of shrubbery in his garden; but it was some time before she found\nthe opportunity. One evening she passed when he, not expecting her, was\nleaning against his garden fence with a book in his hand. She stopped\nunder the pine.\n\n“Mr. Dale,” she said softly, “I want to thank you for your flowers.”\n\nJasper, startled, wished that he might sink into the ground. His anguish\nof embarrassment made her smile a little. He could not speak, so she\nwent on gently.\n\n“It has been so good of you. They have given me so much pleasure--I wish\nyou could know how much.”\n\n“It was nothing--nothing,” stammered Jasper. His book had fallen on the\nground at her feet, and she picked it up and held it out to him.\n\n“So you like Ruskin,” she said. “I do, too. But I haven’t read this.”\n\n“If you--would care--to read it--you may have it,” Jasper contrived to\nsay.\n\nShe carried the book away with her. He did not again hide when she\npassed, and when she brought the book back they talked a little about\nit over the fence. He lent her others, and got some from her in return;\nthey fell into the habit of discussing them. Jasper did not find it hard\nto talk to her now; it seemed as if he were talking to his dream Alice,\nand it came strangely natural to him. He did not talk volubly, but\nAlice thought what he did say was worth while. His words lingered in her\nmemory and made music. She always found his flowers under the pine, and\nshe always wore some of them, but she did not know if he noticed this or\nnot.\n\nOne evening Jasper walked shyly with her from his gate up the pine hill.\nAfter that he always walked that far with her. She would have missed him\nmuch if he had failed to do so; yet it did not occur to her that she was\nlearning to love him. She would have laughed with girlish scorn at the\nidea. She liked him very much; she thought his nature beautiful in\nits simplicity and purity; in spite of his shyness she felt more\ndelightfully at home in his society than in that of any other person she\nhad ever met. He was one of those rare souls whose friendship is at once\na pleasure and a benediction, showering light from their own crystal\nclearness into all the dark corners in the souls of others, until, for\nthe time being at least, they reflected his own nobility. But she never\nthought of love. Like other girls she had her dreams of a possible\nPrince Charming, young and handsome and debonair. It never occurred\nto her that he might be found in the shy, dreamy recluse of Golden\nMilestone.\n\nIn August came a day of gold and blue. Alice Reade, coming through the\ntrees, with the wind blowing her little dark love-locks tricksily about\nunder her wide blue hat, found a fragrant heap of mignonette under\nthe pine. She lifted it and buried her face in it, drinking in the\nwholesome, modest perfume.\n\nShe had hoped Jasper would be in his garden, since she wished to ask him\nfor a book she greatly desired to read. But she saw him sitting on the\nrustic seat at the further side. His back was towards her, and he was\npartially screened by a copse of lilacs.\n\nAlice, blushing slightly, unlatched the garden gate, and went down the\npath. She had never been in the garden before, and she found her heart\nbeating in a strange fashion.\n\nHe did not hear her footsteps, and she was close behind him when she\nheard his voice, and realized that he was talking to himself, in a low,\ndreamy tone. As the meaning of his words dawned on her consciousness she\nstarted and grew crimson. She could not move or speak; as one in a\ndream she stood and listened to the shy man’s reverie, guiltless of any\nthought of eavesdropping.\n\n“How much I love you, Alice,” Jasper Dale was saying, unafraid, with no\nshyness in voice or manner. “I wonder what you would say if you knew.\nYou would laugh at me--sweet as you are, you would laugh in mockery. I\ncan never tell you. I can only dream of telling you. In my dream you are\nstanding here by me, dear. I can see you very plainly, my sweet lady, so\ntall and gracious, with your dark hair and your maiden eyes. I can dream\nthat I tell you my love; that--maddest, sweetest dream of all--that you\nlove me in return. Everything is possible in dreams, you know, dear. My\ndreams are all I have, so I go far in them, even to dreaming that you\nare my wife. I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you. One\nroom will need nothing more--it is your room, dear, and has been ready\nfor you a long time--long before that day I saw you under the pine. Your\nbooks and your chair and your picture are there, dear--only the picture\nis not half lovely enough. But the other rooms of the house must be made\nto bloom out freshly for you. What a delight it is thus to dream of\nwhat I would do for you! Then I would bring you home, dear, and lead\nyou through my garden and into my house as its mistress. I would see you\nstanding beside me in the old mirror at the end of the hall--a bride,\nin your pale blue dress, with a blush on your face. I would lead you\nthrough all the rooms made ready for your coming, and then to your own.\nI would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would\nfind rich fulfilment in that royal moment. Oh, Alice, we would have a\nbeautiful life together! It’s sweet to make believe about it. You will\nsing to me in the twilight, and we will gather early flowers together\nin the spring days. When I come home from work, tired, you will put\nyour arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder. I will stroke\nit--so--that bonny, glossy head of yours. Alice, my Alice--all mine in\nmy dream--never to be mine in real life--how I love you!”\n\nThe Alice behind him could bear no more. She gave a little choking cry\nthat betrayed her presence. Jasper Dale sprang up and gazed upon her. He\nsaw her standing there, amid the languorous shadows of August, pale with\nfeeling, wide-eyed, trembling.\n\nFor a moment shyness wrung him. Then every trace of it was banished by a\nsudden, strange, fierce anger that swept over him. He felt outraged and\nhurt to the death; he felt as if he had been cheated out of something\nincalculably precious--as if sacrilege had been done to his most holy\nsanctuary of emotion. White, tense with his anger, he looked at her and\nspoke, his lips as pale as if his fiery words scathed them.\n\n“How dare you? You have spied on me--you have crept in and listened! How\ndare you? Do you know what you have done, girl? You have destroyed all\nthat made life worth while to me. My dream is dead. It could not live\nwhen it was betrayed. And it was all I had. Oh, laugh at me--mock me! I\nknow that I am ridiculous! What of it? It never could have hurt you! Why\nmust you creep in like this to hear me and put me to shame? Oh, I love\nyou--I will say it, laugh as you will. Is it such a strange thing that I\nshould have a heart like other men? This will make sport for you! I, who\nlove you better than my life, better than any other man in the world\ncan love you, will be a jest to you all your life. I love you--and yet\nI think I could hate you--you have destroyed my dream--you have done me\ndeadly wrong.”\n\n“Jasper! Jasper!” cried Alice, finding her voice. His anger hurt her\nwith a pain she could not endure. It was unbearable that Jasper should\nbe angry with her. In that moment she realized that she loved him--that\nthe words he had spoken when unconscious of her presence were the\nsweetest she had ever heard, or ever could hear. Nothing mattered at\nall, save that he loved her and was angry with her.\n\n“Don’t say such dreadful things to me,” she stammered, “I did not\nmean to listen. I could not help it. I shall never laugh at you. Oh,\nJasper”--she looked bravely at him and the fine soul of her shone\nthrough the flesh like an illuminating lamp--“I am glad that you love\nme! and I am glad I chanced to overhear you, since you would never have\nhad the courage to tell me otherwise. Glad--glad! Do you understand,\nJasper?”\n\nJasper looked at her with the eyes of one who, looking through pain,\nsees rapture beyond.\n\n“Is it possible?” he said, wonderingly. “Alice--I am so much older\nthan you--and they call me the Awkward Man--they say I am unlike other\npeople”--\n\n“You ARE unlike other people,” she said softly, “and that is why I love\nyou. I know now that I must have loved you ever since I saw you.”\n\n“I loved you long before I saw you,” said Jasper.\n\nHe came close to her and drew her into his arms, tenderly and\nreverently, all his shyness and awkwardness swallowed up in the grace\nof his great happiness. In the old garden he kissed her lips and Alice\nentered into her own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. UNCLE BLAIR COMES HOME\n\n\nIt happened that the Story Girl and I both got up very early on the\nmorning of the Awkward Man’s wedding day. Uncle Alec was going to\nCharlottetown that day, and I, awakened at daybreak by the sounds in the\nkitchen beneath us, remembered that I had forgotten to ask him to bring\nme a certain school-book I wanted. So I hurriedly dressed and hastened\ndown to tell him before he went. I was joined on the stairs by the Story\nGirl, who said she had wakened and, not feeling like going to sleep\nagain, thought she might as well get up.\n\n“I had such a funny dream last night,” she said. “I dreamed that I heard\na voice calling me from away down in Uncle Stephen’s Walk--‘Sara, Sara,\nSara,’ it kept calling. I didn’t know whose it was, and yet it seemed\nlike a voice I knew. I wakened up while it was calling, and it seemed so\nreal I could hardly believe it was a dream. It was bright moonlight,\nand I felt just like getting up and going out to the orchard. But I knew\nthat would be silly and of course I didn’t go. But I kept on wanting to\nand I couldn’t sleep any more. Wasn’t it queer?”\n\nWhen Uncle Alec had gone I proposed a saunter to the farther end of the\norchard, where I had left a book the preceding evening. A young mom was\nwalking rosily on the hills as we passed down Uncle Stephen’s Walk,\nwith Paddy trotting before us. High overhead was the spirit-like blue of\npaling skies; the east was a great arc of crystal, smitten through with\nauroral crimsonings; just above it was one milk-white star of morning,\nlike a pearl on a silver sea. A light wind of dawn was weaving an orient\nspell.\n\n“It’s lovely to be up as early as this, isn’t it?” said the Story Girl.\n“The world seems so different just at sunrise, doesn’t it? It makes me\nfeel just like getting up to see the sun rise every morning of my\nlife after this. But I know I won’t. I’ll likely sleep later than ever\ntomorrow morning. But I wish I could.”\n\n“The Awkward Man and Miss Reade are going to have a lovely day for their\nwedding,” I said.\n\n“Yes, and I’m so glad. Beautiful Alice deserves everything good. Why,\nBev--why, Bev! Who is that in the hammock?”\n\nI looked. The hammock was swung under the two end trees of the Walk. In\nit a man was lying, asleep, his head pillowed on his overcoat. He was\nsleeping easily, lightly, and wholesomely. He had a pointed brown beard\nand thick wavy brown hair. His cheeks were a dusky red and the lashes of\nhis closed eyes were as long and dark and silken as a girl’s. He wore a\nlight gray suit, and on the slender white hand that hung down over the\nhammock’s edge was a spark of diamond fire.\n\nIt seemed to me that I knew his face, although assuredly I had never\nseen him before. While I groped among vague speculations the Story Girl\ngave a queer, choked little cry. The next moment she had sprung over the\nintervening space, dropped on her knees by the hammock, and flung her\narms about the man’s neck.\n\n“Father! Father!” she cried, while I stood, rooted to the ground in my\namazement.\n\nThe sleeper stirred and opened two large, exceedingly brilliant hazel\neyes. For a moment he gazed rather blankly at the brown-curled young\nlady who was embracing him. Then a most delightful smile broke over his\nface; he sprang up and caught her to his heart.\n\n“Sara--Sara--my little Sara! To think didn’t know you at first glance!\nBut you are almost a woman. And when I saw you last you were just a\nlittle girl of eight. My own little Sara!”\n\n“Father--father--sometimes I’ve wondered if you were ever coming back to\nme,” I heard the Story Girl say, as I turned and scuttled up the Walk,\nrealizing that I was not wanted there just then and would be little\nmissed. Various emotions and speculations possessed my mind in my\nretreat; but chiefly did I feel a sense of triumph in being the bearer\nof exciting news.\n\n“Aunt Janet, Uncle Blair is here,” I announced breathlessly at the\nkitchen door.\n\nAunt Janet, who was kneading her bread, turned round and lifted floury\nhands. Felicity and Cecily, who were just entering the kitchen, rosy\nfrom slumber, stopped still and stared at me.\n\n“Uncle who?” exclaimed Aunt Janet.\n\n“Uncle Blair--the Story Girl’s father, you know. He’s here.”\n\n“WHERE?”\n\n“Down in the orchard. He was asleep in the hammock. We found him there.”\n\n“Dear me!” said Aunt Janet, sitting down helplessly. “If that isn’t\nlike Blair! Of course he couldn’t come like anybody else. I wonder,” she\nadded in a tone unheard by anyone else save myself, “I wonder if he has\ncome to take the child away.”\n\nMy elation went out like a snuffed candle. I had never thought of this.\nIf Uncle Blair took the Story Girl away would not life become rather\nsavourless on the hill farm? I turned and followed Felicity and Cecily\nout in a very subdued mood.\n\nUncle Blair and the Story Girl were just coming out of the orchard. His\narm was about her and hers was on his shoulder. Laughter and tears were\ncontending in her eyes. Only once before--when Peter had come back from\nthe Valley of the Shadow--had I seen the Story Girl cry. Emotion had to\ngo very deep with her ere it touched the source of tears. I had always\nknown that she loved her father passionately, though she rarely talked\nof him, understanding that her uncles and aunts were not whole-heartedly\nhis friends.\n\nBut Aunt Janet’s welcome was cordial enough, though a trifle flustered.\nWhatever thrifty, hard-working farmer folk might think of gay, Bohemian\nBlair Stanley in his absence, in his presence even they liked him, by\nthe grace of some winsome, lovable quality in the soul of him. He had\n“a way with him”--revealed even in the manner with which he caught staid\nAunt Janet in his arms, swung her matronly form around as though she had\nbeen a slim schoolgirl, and kissed her rosy cheek.\n\n“Sister o’ mine, are you never going to grow old?” he said. “Here you\nare at forty-five with the roses of sixteen--and not a gray hair, I’ll\nwager.”\n\n“Blair, Blair, it is you who are always young,” laughed Aunt Janet, not\nill pleased. “Where in the world did you come from? And what is this I\nhear of your sleeping all night in the hammock?”\n\n“I’ve been painting in the Lake District all summer, as you know,”\n answered Uncle Blair, “and one day I just got homesick to see my little\ngirl. So I sailed for Montreal without further delay. I got here at\neleven last night--the station-master’s son drove me down. Nice boy. The\nold house was in darkness and I thought it would be a shame to rouse you\nall out of bed after a hard day’s work. So I decided that I would spend\nthe night in the orchard. It was moonlight, you know, and moonlight in\nan old orchard is one of the few things left over from the Golden Age.”\n\n“It was very foolish of you,” said practical Aunt Janet. “These\nSeptember nights are real chilly. You might have caught your death of\ncold--or a bad dose of rheumatism.”\n\n“So I might. No doubt it was foolish of me,” agreed Uncle Blair gaily.\n“It must have been the fault, of the moonlight. Moonlight, you know,\nSister Janet, has an intoxicating quality. It is a fine, airy, silver\nwine, such as fairies may drink at their revels, unharmed of it; but\nwhen a mere mortal sips of it, it mounts straightway to his brain, to\nthe undoing of his daylight common sense. However, I have got neither\ncold nor rheumatism, as a sensible person would have done had he ever\nbeen lured into doing such a non-sensible thing; there is a special\nProvidence for us foolish folk. I enjoyed my night in the orchard; for\na time I was companioned by sweet old memories; and then I fell asleep\nlistening to the murmurs of the wind in those old trees yonder. And I\nhad a beautiful dream, Janet. I dreamed that the old orchard blossomed\nagain, as it did that spring eighteen years ago. I dreamed that its\nsunshine was the sunshine of spring, not autumn. There was newness of\nlife in my dream, Janet, and the sweetness of forgotten words.”\n\n“Wasn’t it strange about MY dream?” whispered the Story Girl to me.\n\n“Well, you’d better come in and have some breakfast,” said Aunt Janet.\n“These are my little girls--Felicity and Cecily.”\n\n“I remember them as two most adorable tots,” said Uncle Blair, shaking\nhands. “They haven’t changed quite so much as my own baby-child. Why,\nshe’s a woman, Janet--she’s a woman.”\n\n“She’s child enough still,” said Aunt Janet hastily.\n\nThe Story Girl shook her long brown curls.\n\n“I’m fifteen,” she said. “And you ought to see me in my long dress,\nfather.”\n\n“We must not be separated any longer, dear heart,” I heard Uncle Blair\nsay tenderly. I hoped that he meant he would stay in Canada--not that he\nwould take the Story Girl away.\n\nApart from this we had a gay day with Uncle Blair. He evidently liked\nour society better than that of the grown-ups, for he was a child\nhimself at heart, gay, irresponsible, always acting on the impulse of\nthe moment. We all found him a delightful companion. There was no\nschool that day, as Mr. Perkins was absent, attending a meeting of\nthe Teachers’ Convention, so we spent most of its golden hours in the\norchard with Uncle Blair, listening to his fascinating accounts of\nforeign wanderings. He also drew all our pictures for us, and this was\nespecially delightful, for the day of the camera was only just dawning\nand none of us had ever had even our photographs taken. Sara Ray’s\npleasure was, as usual, quite spoiled by wondering what her mother\nwould say of it, for Mrs. Ray had, so it appeared, some very peculiar\nprejudices against the taking or making of any kind of picture\nwhatsoever, owing to an exceedingly strict interpretation of the second\ncommandment. Dan suggested that she need not tell her mother anything\nabout it; but Sara shook her head.\n\n“I’ll have to tell her. I’ve made it a rule to tell ma everything I do\never since the Judgment Day.”\n\n“Besides,” added Cecily seriously, “the Family Guide says one ought to\ntell one’s mother everything.”\n\n“It’s pretty hard sometimes, though,” sighed Sara. “Ma scolds so much\nwhen I do tell her things, that it sort of discourages me. But when I\nthink of how dreadful I felt the time of the Judgment Day over deceiving\nher in some things it nerves me up. I’d do almost anything rather than\nfeel like that the next time the Judgment Day comes.”\n\n“Fe, fi, fo, fum, I smell a story,” said Uncle Blair. “What do you mean\nby speaking of the Judgment Day in the past tense?”\n\nThe Story Girl told him the tale of that dreadful Sunday in the\npreceding summer and we all laughed with him at ourselves.\n\n“All the same,” muttered Peter, “I don’t want to have another experience\nlike that. I hope I’ll be dead the next time the Judgment Day comes.”\n\n“But you’ll be raised up for it,” said Felix.\n\n“Oh, that’ll be all right. I won’t mind that. I won’t know anything\nabout it till it really happens. It’s the expecting it that’s the\nworst.”\n\n“I don’t think you ought to talk of such things,” said Felicity.\n\nWhen evening came we all went to Golden Milestone. We knew the Awkward\nMan and his bride were expected home at sunset, and we meant to scatter\nflowers on the path by which she must enter her new home. It was the\nStory Girl’s idea, but I don’t think Aunt Janet would have let us go if\nUncle Blair had not pleaded for us. He asked to be taken along, too, and\nwe agreed, if he would stand out of sight when the newly married pair\ncame home.\n\n“You see, father, the Awkward Man won’t mind us, because we’re only\nchildren and he knows us well,” explained the Story Girl, “but if\nhe sees you, a stranger, it might confuse him and we might spoil the\nhomecoming, and that would be such a pity.”\n\nSo we went to Golden Milestone, laden with all the flowery spoil we\ncould plunder from both gardens. It was a clear amber-tinted September\nevening and far away, over Markdale Harbour, a great round red moon\nwas rising as we waited. Uncle Blair was hidden behind the wind-blown\ntassels of the pines at the gate, but he and the Story Girl kept waving\ntheir hands at each other and calling out gay, mirthful jests.\n\n“Do you really feel acquainted with your father?” whispered Sara Ray\nwonderingly. “It’s long since you saw him.”\n\n“If I hadn’t seen him for a hundred years it wouldn’t make any\ndifference that way,” laughed the Story Girl.\n\n“S-s-h-s-s-h--they’re coming,” whispered Felicity excitedly.\n\nAnd then they came--Beautiful Alice blushing and lovely, in the\nprettiest of pretty blue dresses, and the Awkward Man, so fervently\nhappy that he quite forgot to be awkward. He lifted her out of the buggy\ngallantly and led her forward to us, smiling. We retreated before them,\nscattering our flowers lavishly on the path, and Alice Dale walked to\nthe very doorstep of her new home over a carpet of blossoms. On the\nstep they both paused and turned towards us, and we shyly did the proper\nthing in the way of congratulations and good wishes.\n\n“It was so sweet of you to do this,” said the smiling bride.\n\n“It was lovely to be able to do it for you, dearest,” whispered the\nStory Girl, “and oh, Miss Reade--Mrs. Dale, I mean--we all hope you’ll\nbe so, so happy for ever.”\n\n“I am sure I shall,” said Alice Dale, turning to her husband. He looked\ndown into her eyes--and we were quite forgotten by both of them. We saw\nit, and slipped away, while Jasper Dale drew his wife into their home\nand shut the world out.\n\nWe scampered joyously away through the moonlit dusk. Uncle Blair joined\nus at the gate and the Story Girl asked him what he thought of the\nbride.\n\n“When she dies white violets will grow out of her dust,” he answered.\n\n“Uncle Blair says even queerer things than the Story Girl,” Felicity\nwhispered to me.\n\nAnd so that beautiful day went away from us, slipping through our\nfingers as we tried to hold it. It hooded itself in shadows and fared\nforth on the road that is lighted by the white stars of evening. It had\nbeen a gift of Paradise. Its hours had all been fair and beloved. From\ndawn flush to fall of night there had been naught to mar it. It took\nwith it its smiles and laughter. But it left the boon of memory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH\n\n\n“I am going away with father when he goes. He is going to spend the\nwinter in Paris, and I am to go to school there.”\n\nThe Story Girl told us this one day in the orchard. There was a little\nelation in her tone, but more regret. The news was not a great surprise\nto us. We had felt it in the air ever since Uncle Blair’s arrival. Aunt\nJanet had been very unwilling to let the Story Girl go. But Uncle Blair\nwas inexorable. It was time, he said, that she should go to a better\nschool than the little country one in Carlisle; and besides, he did not\nwant her to grow into womanhood a stranger to him. So it was finally\ndecided that she was to go.\n\n“Just think, you are going to Europe,” said Sara Ray in an awe-struck\ntone. “Won’t that be splendid!”\n\n“I suppose I’ll like it after a while,” said the Story Girl slowly,\n“but I know I’ll be dreadfully homesick at first. Of course, it will be\nlovely to be with father, but oh, I’ll miss the rest of you so much!”\n\n“Just think how WE’LL miss YOU,” sighed Cecily. “It will be so lonesome\nhere this winter, with you and Peter both gone. Oh, dear, I do wish\nthings didn’t have to change.”\n\nFelicity said nothing. She kept looking down at the grass on which she\nsat, absently pulling at the slender blades. Presently we saw two big\ntears roll down over her cheeks. The Story Girl looked surprised.\n\n“Are you crying because I’m going away, Felicity?” she asked.\n\n“Of course I am,” answered Felicity, with a big sob. “Do you think I’ve\nno f-f-eeling?”\n\n“I didn’t think you’d care much,” said the Story Girl frankly. “You’ve\nnever seemed to like me very much.”\n\n“I d-don’t wear my h-heart on my sleeve,” said poor Felicity, with an\nattempt at dignity. “I think you m-might stay. Your father would let you\ns-stay if you c-coaxed him.”\n\n“Well, you see I’d have to go some time,” sighed the Story Girl,\n“and the longer it was put off the harder it would be. But I do feel\ndreadfully about it. I can’t even take poor Paddy. I’ll have to leave\nhim behind, and oh, I want you all to promise to be kind to him for my\nsake.”\n\nWe all solemnly assured her that we would.\n\n“I’ll g-give him cream every m-morning and n-night,” sobbed Felicity,\n“but I’ll never be able to look at him without crying. He’ll make me\nthink of you.”\n\n“Well, I’m not going right away,” said the Story Girl, more cheerfully.\n“Not till the last of October. So we have over a month yet to have a\ngood time in. Let’s all just determine to make it a splendid month for\nthe last. We won’t think about my going at all till we have to, and we\nwon’t have any quarrels among us, and we’ll just enjoy ourselves all we\npossibly can. So don’t cry any more, Felicity. I’m awfully glad you\ndo like me and am sorry I’m going away, but let’s all forget it for a\nmonth.”\n\nFelicity sighed, and tucked away her damp handkerchief.\n\n“It isn’t so easy for me to forget things, but I’ll try,” she said\ndisconsolately, “and if you want any more cooking lessons before you go\nI’ll be real glad to teach you anything I know.”\n\nThis was a high plane of self-sacrifice for Felicity to attain. But the\nStory Girl shook her head.\n\n“No, I’m not going to bother my head about cooking lessons this last\nmonth. It’s too vexing.”\n\n“Do you remember the time you made the pudding--” began Peter, and\nsuddenly stopped.\n\n“Out of sawdust?” finished the Story Girl cheerfully. “You needn’t be\nafraid to mention it to me after this. I don’t mind any more. I begin to\nsee the fun of it now. I should think I do remember it--and the time I\nbaked the bread before it was raised enough.”\n\n“People have made worse mistakes than that,” said Felicity kindly.\n\n“Such as using tooth-powd--” but here Dan stopped abruptly, remembering\nthe Story Girl’s plea for a beautiful month. Felicity coloured, but said\nnothing--did not even LOOK anything.\n\n“We HAVE had lots of fun together one way or another,” said Cecily,\nretrospectively.\n\n“Just think how much we’ve laughed this last year or so,” said the Story\nGirl. “We’ve had good times together; but I think we’ll have lots more\nsplendid years ahead.”\n\n“Eden is always behind us--Paradise always before,” said Uncle\nBlair, coming up in time to hear her. He said it with a sigh that was\nimmediately lost in one of his delightful smiles.\n\n“I like Uncle Blair so much better than I expected to,” Felicity\nconfided to me. “Mother says he’s a rolling stone, but there really is\nsomething very nice about him, although he says a great many things I\ndon’t understand. I suppose the Story Girl will have a very gay time in\nParis.”\n\n“She’s going to school and she’ll have to study hard,” I said.\n\n“She says she’s going to study for the stage,” said Felicity. “Uncle\nRoger thinks it is all right, and says she’ll be very famous some day.\nBut mother thinks it’s dreadful, and so do I.”\n\n“Aunt Julia is a concert singer,” I said.\n\n“Oh, that’s very different. But I hope poor Sara will get on all right,”\n sighed Felicity. “You never know what may happen to a person in those\nforeign countries. And everybody says Paris is such a wicked place. But\nwe must hope for the best,” she concluded in a resigned tone.\n\nThat evening the Story Girl and I drove the cows to pasture after\nmilking, and when we came home we sought out Uncle Blair in the orchard.\nHe was sauntering up and down Uncle Stephen’s Walk, his hands clasped\nbehind him and his beautiful, youthful face uplifted to the western sky\nwhere waves of night were breaking on a dim primrose shore of sunset.\n\n“See that star over there in the south-west?” he said, as we joined him.\n“The one just above that pine? An evening star shining over a dark\npine tree is the whitest thing in the universe--because it is LIVING\nwhiteness--whiteness possessing a soul. How full this old orchard is of\ntwilight! Do you know, I have been trysting here with ghosts.”\n\n“The Family Ghost?” I asked, very stupidly.\n\n“No, not the Family Ghost. I never saw beautiful, broken-hearted Emily\nyet. Your mother saw her once, Sara--that was a strange thing,” he added\nabsently, as if to himself.\n\n“Did mother really see her?” whispered the Story Girl.\n\n“Well, she always believed she did. Who knows?”\n\n“Do you think there are such things as ghosts, Uncle Blair?” I asked\ncuriously.\n\n“I never saw any, Beverley.”\n\n“But you said you were trysting with ghosts here this evening,” said the\nStory Girl.\n\n“Oh, yes--the ghosts of the old years. I love this orchard because of\nits many ghosts. We are good comrades, those ghosts and I; we walk and\ntalk--we even laugh together--sorrowful laughter that has sorrow’s own\nsweetness. And always there comes to me one dear phantom and wanders\nhand in hand with me--a lost lady of the old years.”\n\n“My mother?” said the Story Girl very softly.\n\n“Yes, your mother. Here, in her old haunts, it is impossible for me to\nbelieve that she can be dead--that her LAUGHTER can be dead. She was the\ngayest, sweetest thing--and so young--only three years older than you,\nSara. Yonder old house had been glad because of her for eighteen years\nwhen I met her first.”\n\n“I wish I could remember her,” said the Story Girl, with a little sigh.\n“I haven’t even a picture of her. Why didn’t you paint one, father?”\n\n“She would never let me. She had some queer, funny, half-playful,\nhalf-earnest superstition about it. But I always meant to when she would\nbecome willing to let me. And then--she died. Her twin brother Felix\ndied the same day. There was something strange about that, too. I was\nholding her in my arms and she was looking up at me; suddenly she looked\npast me and gave a little start. ‘Felix!’ she said. For a moment\nshe trembled and then she smiled and looked up at me again a little\nbeseechingly. ‘Felix has come for me, dear,’ she said. ‘We were always\ntogether before you came--you must not mind--you must be glad I do not\nhave to go alone.’ Well, who knows? But she left me, Sara--she left me.”\n\nThere was that in Uncle Blair’s voice that kept us silent for a time.\nThen the Story Girl said, still very softly:\n\n“What did mother look like, father? I don’t look the least little bit\nlike her, do I?”\n\n“No, I wish you did, you brown thing. Your mother’s face was as white as\na wood-lily, with only a faint dream of rose in her cheeks. She had the\neyes of one who always had a song in her heart--blue as a mist, those\neyes were. She had dark lashes, and a little red mouth that quivered\nwhen she was very sad or very happy like a crimson rose too rudely\nshaken by the wind. She was as slim and lithe as a young, white-stemmed\nbirch tree. How I loved her! How happy we were! But he who accepts human\nlove must bind it to his soul with pain, and she is not lost to me.\nNothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it.”\n\nUncle Blair looked up at the evening star. We saw that he had forgotten\nus, and we slipped away, hand in hand, leaving him alone in the\nmemory-haunted shadows of the old orchard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. THE PATH TO ARCADY\n\n\nOctober that year gathered up all the spilled sunshine of the summer and\nclad herself in it as in a garment. The Story Girl had asked us to\ntry to make the last month together beautiful, and Nature seconded our\nefforts, giving us that most beautiful of beautiful things--a gracious\nand perfect moon of falling leaves. There was not in all that vanished\nOctober one day that did not come in with auroral splendour and go out\nattended by a fair galaxy of evening stars--not a day when there were\nnot golden lights in the wide pastures and purple hazes in the ripened\ndistances. Never was anything so gorgeous as the maple trees that year.\nMaples are trees that have primeval fire in their souls. It glows out a\nlittle in their early youth, before the leaves open, in the redness and\nrosy-yellowness of their blossoms, but in summer it is carefully hidden\nunder a demure, silver-lined greenness. Then when autumn comes, the\nmaples give up trying to be sober and flame out in all the barbaric\nsplendour and gorgeousness of their real nature, making of the hills\nthings out of an Arabian Nights dream in the golden prime of good Haroun\nAlraschid.\n\nYou may never know what scarlet and crimson really are until you see\nthem in their perfection on an October hillside, under the unfathomable\nblue of an autumn sky. All the glow and radiance and joy at earth’s\nheart seem to have broken loose in a splendid determination to express\nitself for once before the frost of winter chills her beating pulses. It\nis the year’s carnival ere the dull Lenten days of leafless valleys and\npenitential mists come.\n\nThe time of apple-picking had come around once more and we worked\njoyously. Uncle Blair picked apples with us, and between him and the\nStory Girl it was an October never to be forgotten.\n\n“Will you go far afield for a walk with me to-day?” he said to her and\nme, one idle afternoon of opal skies, pied meadows and misty hills.\n\nIt was Saturday and Peter had gone home; Felix and Dan were helping\nUncle Alec top turnips; Cecily and Felicity were making cookies for\nSunday, so the Story Girl and I were alone in Uncle Stephen’s Walk.\n\nWe liked to be alone together that last month, to think the long, long\nthoughts of youth and talk about our futures. There had grown up between\nus that summer a bond of sympathy that did not exist between us and the\nothers. We were older than they--the Story Girl was fifteen and I was\nnearly that; and all at once it seemed as if we were immeasurably older\nthan the rest, and possessed of dreams and visions and forward-reaching\nhopes which they could not possibly share or understand. At times we\nwere still children, still interested in childish things. But there came\nhours when we seemed to our two selves very grown up and old, and\nin those hours we talked our dreams and visions and hopes, vague and\nsplendid, as all such are, over together, and so began to build up, out\nof the rainbow fragments of our childhood’s companionship, that rare\nand beautiful friendship which was to last all our lives, enriching and\nenstarring them. For there is no bond more lasting than that formed by\nthe mutual confidences of that magic time when youth is slipping from\nthe sheath of childhood and beginning to wonder what lies for it beyond\nthose misty hills that bound the golden road.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked the Story Girl.\n\n“To ‘the woods that belt the gray hillside’--ay, and overflow beyond it\ninto many a valley purple-folded in immemorial peace,” answered Uncle\nBlair. “I have a fancy for one more ramble in Prince Edward Island woods\nbefore I leave Canada again. But I would not go alone. So come, you two\ngay youthful things to whom all life is yet fair and good, and we will\nseek the path to Arcady. There will be many little things along our\nway to make us glad. Joyful sounds will ‘come ringing down the wind;’ a\nwealth of gypsy gold will be ours for the gathering; we will learn the\npotent, unutterable charm of a dim spruce wood and the grace of flexile\nmountain ashes fringing a lonely glen; we will tryst with the folk of\nfur and feather; we’ll hearken to the music of gray old firs. Come, and\nyou’ll have a ramble and an afternoon that you will both remember all\nyour lives.”\n\nWe did have it; never has its remembrance faded; that idyllic afternoon\nof roving in the old Carlisle woods with the Story Girl and Uncle Blair\ngleams in my book of years, a page of living beauty. Yet it was but\na few hours of simplest pleasure; we wandered pathlessly through the\nsylvan calm of those dear places which seemed that day to be full of\na great friendliness; Uncle Blair sauntered along behind us, whistling\nsoftly; sometimes he talked to himself; we delighted in those brief\nreveries of his; Uncle Blair was the only man I have ever known who\ncould, when he so willed, “talk like a book,” and do it without seeming\nridiculous; perhaps it was because he had the knack of choosing “fit\naudience, though few,” and the proper time to appeal to that audience.\n\nWe went across the fields, intending to skirt the woods at the back of\nUncle Alec’s farm and find a lane that cut through Uncle Roger’s woods;\nbut before we came to it we stumbled on a sly, winding little path quite\nby accident--if, indeed, there can be such a thing as accident in the\nwoods, where I am tempted to think we are led by the Good People along\nsuch of their fairy ways as they have a mind for us to walk in.\n\n“Go to, let us explore this,” said Uncle Blair. “It always drags\nterribly at my heart to go past a wood lane if I can make any excuse at\nall for traversing it: for it is the by-ways that lead to the heart of\nthe woods and we must follow them if we would know the forest and be\nknown of it. When we can really feel its wild heart beating against ours\nits subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own for ever,\nso that no matter where we go or how wide we wander in the noisy ways of\ncities or over the lone ways of the sea, we shall yet be drawn back to\nthe forest to find our most enduring kinship.”\n\n“I always feel so SATISFIED in the woods,” said the Story Girl dreamily,\nas we turned in under the low-swinging fir boughs. “Trees seem such\nfriendly things.”\n\n“They are the most friendly things in God’s good creation,” said Uncle\nBlair emphatically. “And it is so easy to live with them. To hold\nconverse with pines, to whisper secrets with the poplars, to listen to\nthe tales of old romance that beeches have to tell, to walk in eloquent\nsilence with self-contained firs, is to learn what real companionship\nis. Besides, trees are the same all over the world. A beech tree on the\nslopes of the Pyrenees is just what a beech tree here in these Carlisle\nwoods is; and there used to be an old pine hereabouts whose twin brother\nI was well acquainted with in a dell among the Apennines. Listen to\nthose squirrels, will you, chattering over yonder. Did you ever hear\nsuch a fuss over nothing? Squirrels are the gossips and busybodies of\nthe woods; they haven’t learned the fine reserve of its other denizens.\nBut after all, there is a certain shrill friendliness in their\ngreeting.”\n\n“They seem to be scolding us,” I said, laughing.\n\n“Oh, they are not half such scolds as they sound,” answered Uncle Blair\ngaily. “If they would but ‘tak a thought and mend’ their shrew-like ways\nthey would be dear, lovable creatures enough.”\n\n“If I had to be an animal I think I’d like to be a squirrel,” said the\nStory Girl. “It must be next best thing to flying.”\n\n“Just see what a spring that fellow gave,” laughed Uncle Blair. “And now\nlisten to his song of triumph! I suppose that chasm he cleared seemed as\nwide and deep to him as Niagara Gorge would to us if we leaped over\nit. Well, the wood people are a happy folk and very well satisfied with\nthemselves.”\n\nThose who have followed a dim, winding, balsamic path to the unexpected\nhollow where a wood-spring lies have found the rarest secret the forest\ncan reveal. Such was our good fortune that day. At the end of our path\nwe found it, under the pines, a crystal-clear thing with lips unkissed\nby so much as a stray sunbeam.\n\n“It is easy to dream that this is one of the haunted springs of old\nromance,” said Uncle Blair. “‘Tis an enchanted spot this, I am very\nsure, and we should go softly, speaking low, lest we disturb the rest\nof a white, wet naiad, or break some spell that has cost long years of\nmystic weaving.”\n\n“It’s so easy to believe things in the woods,” said the Story Girl,\nshaping a cup from a bit of golden-brown birch bark and filling it at\nthe spring.\n\n“Drink a toast in that water, Sara,” said Uncle Blair. “There’s not a\ndoubt that it has some potent quality of magic in it and the wish you\nwish over it will come true.”\n\nThe Story Girl lifted her golden-hued flagon to her red lips. Her hazel\neyes laughed at us over the brim.\n\n“Here’s to our futures,” she cried, “I wish that every day of our lives\nmay be better than the one that went before.”\n\n“An extravagant wish--a very wish of youth,” commented Uncle Blair, “and\nyet in spite of its extravagance, a wish that will come true if you are\ntrue to yourselves. In that case, every day WILL be better than all that\nwent before--but there will be many days, dear lad and lass, when you\nwill not believe it.”\n\nWe did not understand him, but we knew Uncle Blair never explained his\nmeaning. When asked it he was wont to answer with a smile, “Some day\nyou’ll grow to it. Wait for that.” So we addressed ourselves to follow\nthe brook that stole away from the spring in its windings and doublings\nand tricky surprises.\n\n“A brook,” quoth Uncle Blair, “is the most changeful, bewitching,\nlovable thing in the world. It is never in the same mind or mood two\nminutes. Here it is sighing and murmuring as if its heart were broken.\nBut listen--yonder by the birches it is laughing as if it were enjoying\nsome capital joke all by itself.”\n\nIt was indeed a changeful brook; here it would make a pool, dark and\nbrooding and still, where we bent to look at our mirrored faces; then it\ngrew communicative and gossiped shallowly over a broken pebble bed where\nthere was a diamond dance of sunbeams and no troutling or minnow could\nglide through without being seen. Sometimes its banks were high and\nsteep, hung with slender ashes and birches; again they were mere, low\nmargins, green with delicate mosses, shelving out of the wood. Once\nit came to a little precipice and flung itself over undauntedly in an\nindignation of foam, gathering itself up rather dizzily among the mossy\nstones below. It was some time before it got over its vexation; it went\nboiling and muttering along, fighting with the rotten logs that lie\nacross it, and making far more fuss than was necessary over every root\nthat interfered with it. We were getting tired of its ill-humour and\ntalked of leaving it, when it suddenly grew sweet-tempered again,\nswooped around a curve--and presto, we were in fairyland.\n\nIt was a little dell far in the heart of the woods. A row of birches\nfringed the brook, and each birch seemed more exquisitely graceful\nand golden than her sisters. The woods receded from it on every hand,\nleaving it lying in a pool of amber sunshine. The yellow trees were\nmirrored in the placid stream, with now and then a leaf falling on the\nwater, mayhap to drift away and be used, as Uncle Blair suggested, by\nsome adventurous wood sprite who had it in mind to fare forth to some\nfar-off, legendary region where all the brooks ran into the sea.\n\n“Oh, what a lovely place!” I exclaimed, looking around me with delight.\n\n“A spell of eternity is woven over it, surely,” murmured Uncle Blair.\n“Winter may not touch it, or spring ever revisit it. It should be like\nthis for ever.”\n\n“Let us never come here again,” said the Story Girl softly, “never,\nno matter how often we may be in Carlisle. Then we will never see it\nchanged or different. We can always remember it just as we see it now,\nand it will be like this for ever for us.”\n\n“I’m going to sketch it,” said Uncle Blair.\n\nWhile he sketched it the Story Girl and I sat on the banks of the brook\nand she told me the story of the Sighing Reed. It was a very simple\nlittle story, that of the slender brown reed which grew by the forest\npool and always was sad and sighing because it could not utter music\nlike the brook and the birds and the winds. All the bright, beautiful\nthings around it mocked it and laughed at it for its folly. Who would\never look for music in it, a plain, brown, unbeautiful thing? But one\nday a youth came through the wood; he was as beautiful as the spring; he\ncut the brown reed and fashioned it according to his liking; and then he\nput it to his lips and breathed on it; and, oh, the music that floated\nthrough the forest! It was so entrancing that everything--brooks and\nbirds and winds--grew silent to listen to it. Never had anything so\nlovely been heard; it was the music that had for so long been shut up in\nthe soul of the sighing reed and was set free at last through its pain\nand suffering.\n\nI had heard the Story Girl tell many a more dramatic tale; but that one\nstands out for me in memory above them all, partly, perhaps, because of\nthe spot in which she told it, partly because it was the last one I was\nto hear her tell for many years--the last one she was ever to tell me on\nthe golden road.\n\nWhen Uncle Blair had finished his sketch the shafts of sunshine were\nturning crimson and growing more and more remote; the early autumn\ntwilight was falling over the woods. We left our dell, saying good-bye\nto it for ever, as the Story Girl had suggested, and we went slowly\nhomeward through the fir woods, where a haunting, indescribable odour\nstole out to meet us.\n\n“There is magic in the scent of dying fir,” Uncle Blair was saying aloud\nto himself, as if forgetting he was not quite alone. “It gets into\nour blood like some rare, subtly-compounded wine, and thrills us with\nunutterable sweetnesses, as of recollections from some other fairer\nlife, lived in some happier star. Compared to it, all other scents seem\nheavy and earth-born, luring to the valleys instead of the heights. But\nthe tang of the fir summons onward and upward to some ‘far-off, divine\nevent’--some spiritual peak of attainment whence we shall see with\nunfaltering, unclouded vision the spires of some aerial City Beautiful,\nor the fulfilment of some fair, fadeless land of promise.”\n\nHe was silent for a moment, then added in a lower tone,\n\n“Felicity, you loved the scent of dying fir. If you were here tonight\nwith me--Felicity--Felicity!”\n\nSomething in his voice made me suddenly sad. I was comforted when I felt\nthe Story Girl slip her hand into mine. So we walked out of the woods\ninto the autumn dusk.\n\nWe were in a little valley. Half-way up the opposite slope a brush fire\nwas burning clearly and steadily in a maple grove. There was something\nindescribably alluring in that fire, glowing so redly against the dark\nbackground of forest and twilit hill.\n\n“Let us go to it,” cried Uncle Blair, gaily, casting aside his sorrowful\nmood and catching our hands. “A wood fire at night has a fascination not\nto be resisted by those of mortal race. Hasten--we must not lose time.”\n\n“Oh, it will burn a long time yet,” I gasped, for Uncle Blair was\nwhisking us up the hill at a merciless rate.\n\n“You can’t be sure. It may have been lighted by some good, honest\nfarmer-man, bent on tidying up his sugar orchard, but it may also, for\nanything we know, have been kindled by no earthly woodman as a beacon or\nsummons to the tribes of fairyland, and may vanish away if we tarry.”\n\nIt did not vanish and presently we found ourselves in the grove. It was\nvery beautiful; the fire burned with a clear, steady glow and a soft\ncrackle; the long arcades beneath the trees were illuminated with a\nrosy radiance, beyond which lurked companies of gray and purple shadows.\nEverything was very still and dreamy and remote.\n\n“It is impossible that out there, just over the hill, lies a village of\nmen, where tame household lamps are shining,” said Uncle Blair.\n\n“I feel as if we must be thousands of miles away from everything we’ve\never known,” murmured the Story Girl.\n\n“So you are!” said Uncle Blair emphatically. “You’re back in the youth\nof the race--back in the beguilement of the young world. Everything\nis in this hour--the beauty of classic myths, the primal charm of the\nsilent and the open, the lure of mystery. Why, it’s a time and place\nwhen and where everything might come true--when the men in green might\ncreep out to join hands and dance around the fire, or dryads steal from\ntheir trees to warm their white limbs, grown chilly in October frosts,\nby the blaze. I wouldn’t be much surprised if we should see something\nof the kind. Isn’t that the flash of an ivory shoulder through yonder\ngloom? And didn’t you see a queer little elfin face peering at us around\nthat twisted gray trunk? But one can’t be sure. Mortal eyesight is too\nslow and clumsy a thing to match against the flicker of a pixy-litten\nfire.”\n\nHand in hand we wandered through that enchanted place, seeking the folk\nof elf-land, “and heard their mystic voices calling, from fairy knoll\nand haunted hill.” Not till the fire died down into ashes did we leave\nthe grove. Then we found that the full moon was gleaming lustrously from\na cloudless sky across the valley. Between us and her stretched up a\ntall pine, wondrously straight and slender and branchless to its very\ntop, where it overflowed in a crest of dark boughs against the silvery\nsplendour behind it. Beyond, the hill farms were lying in a suave, white\nradiance.\n\n“Doesn’t it seem a long, long time to you since we left home this\nafternoon?” asked the Story Girl. “And yet it is only a few hours.”\n\nOnly a few hours--true; yet such hours were worth a cycle of common\nyears untouched by the glory and the dream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. WE LOSE A FRIEND\n\n\nOur beautiful October was marred by one day of black tragedy--the day\nPaddy died. For Paddy, after seven years of as happy a life as ever\na cat lived, died suddenly--of poison, as was supposed. Where he had\nwandered in the darkness to meet his doom we did not know, but in the\nfrosty dawnlight he dragged himself home to die. We found him lying\non the doorstep when we got up, and it did not need Aunt Janet’s curt\nannouncement, or Uncle Blair’s reluctant shake of the head, to tell us\nthat there was no chance of our pet recovering this time. We felt that\nnothing could be done. Lard and sulphur on his paws would be of no use,\nnor would any visit to Peg Bowen avail. We stood around in mournful\nsilence; the Story Girl sat down on the step and took poor Paddy upon\nher lap.\n\n“I s’pose there’s no use even in praying now,” said Cecily desperately.\n\n“It wouldn’t do any harm to try,” sobbed Felicity.\n\n“You needn’t waste your prayers,” said Dan mournfully, “Pat is beyond\nhuman aid. You can tell that by his eyes. Besides, I don’t believe it\nwas the praying cured him last time.”\n\n“No, it was Peg Bowen,” declared Peter, “but she couldn’t have bewitched\nhim this time for she’s been away for months, nobody knows where.”\n\n“If he could only TELL us where he feels the worst!” said Cecily\npiteously. “It’s so dreadful to see him suffering and not be able to do\na single thing to help him!”\n\n“I don’t think he’s suffering much now,” I said comfortingly.\n\nThe Story Girl said nothing. She passed and repassed her long brown hand\ngently over her pet’s glossy fur. Pat lifted his head and essayed to\ncreep a little nearer to his beloved mistress. The Story Girl drew his\nlimp body close in her arms. There was a plaintive little mew--a long\nquiver--and Paddy’s friendly soul had fared forth to wherever it is that\ngood cats go.\n\n“Well, he’s gone,” said Dan, turning his back abruptly to us.\n\n“It doesn’t seem as if it can be true,” sobbed Cecily. “This time\nyesterday morning he was full of life.”\n\n“He drank two full saucers of cream,” moaned Felicity, “and I saw him\ncatch a mouse in the evening. Maybe it was the last one he ever caught.”\n\n“He did for many a mouse in his day,” said Peter, anxious to pay his\ntribute to the departed.\n\n“‘He was a cat--take him for all in all. We shall not look upon his like\nagain,’” quoted Uncle Blair.\n\nFelicity and Cecily and Sara Ray cried so much that Aunt Janet lost\npatience completely and told them sharply that they would have something\nto cry for some day--which did not seem to comfort them much. The Story\nGirl shed no tears, though the look in her eyes hurt more than weeping.\n\n“After all, perhaps it’s for the best,” she said drearily. “I’ve been\nfeeling so badly over having to go away and leave Paddy. No matter how\nkind you’d all be to him I know he’d miss me terribly. He wasn’t like\nmost cats who don’t care who comes and goes as long as they get plenty\nto eat. Paddy wouldn’t have been contented without me.”\n\n“Oh, no-o-o, oh, no-o-o,” wailed Sara Ray lugubriously.\n\nFelix shot a disgusted glance at her.\n\n“I don’t see what YOU are making such a fuss about,” he said\nunfeelingly. “He wasn’t your cat.”\n\n“But I l-l-oved him,” sobbed Sara, “and I always feel bad when my\nfriends d-do.”\n\n“I wish we could believe that cats went to heaven, like people,” sighed\nCecily. “Do you really think it isn’t possible?”\n\nUncle Blair shook his head.\n\n“I’m afraid not. I’d like to think cats have a chance for heaven, but I\ncan’t. There’s nothing heavenly about cats, delightful creatures though\nthey are.”\n\n“Blair, I’m really surprised to hear the things you say to the\nchildren,” said Aunt Janet severely.\n\n“Surely you wouldn’t prefer me to tell them that cats DO go to heaven,”\n protested Uncle Blair.\n\n“I think it’s wicked to carry on about an animal as those children do,”\n answered Aunt Janet decidedly, “and you shouldn’t encourage them. Here\nnow, children, stop making a fuss. Bury that cat and get off to your\napple picking.”\n\nWe had to go to our work, but Paddy was not to be buried in any such\noff-hand fashion as that. It was agreed that we should bury him in\nthe orchard at sunset that evening, and Sara Ray, who had to go home,\ndeclared she would be back for it, and implored us to wait for her if\nshe didn’t come exactly on time.\n\n“I mayn’t be able to get away till after milking,” she sniffed, “but I\ndon’t want to miss it. Even a cat’s funeral is better than none at all.”\n\n“Horrid thing!” said Felicity, barely waiting until Sara was out of\nearshot.\n\nWe worked with heavy hearts that day; the girls cried bitterly most of\nthe time and we boys whistled defiantly. But as evening drew on we began\nto feel a sneaking interest in the details of the funeral. As Dan said,\nthe thing should be done properly, since Paddy was no common cat. The\nStory Girl selected the spot for the grave, in a little corner behind\nthe cherry copse, where early violets enskied the grass in spring, and\nwe boys dug the grave, making it “soft and narrow,” as the heroine of\nthe old ballad wanted hers made. Sara Ray, who managed to come in time\nafter all, and Felicity stood and watched us, but Cecily and the Story\nGirl kept far aloof.\n\n“This time last night you never thought you’d be digging Pat’s grave\nto-night,” sighed Felicity.\n\n“We little k-know what a day will bring forth,” sobbed Sara. “I’ve heard\nthe minister say that and it is true.”\n\n“Of course it’s true. It’s in the Bible; but I don’t think you should\nrepeat it in connection with a cat,” said Felicity dubiously.\n\nWhen all was in readiness the Story Girl brought her pet through the\norchard where he had so often frisked and prowled. No useless coffin\nenclosed his breast but he reposed in a neat cardboard box.\n\n“I wonder if it would be right to say ‘ashes to ashes and dust to\ndust,’” said Peter.\n\n“No, it wouldn’t,” averred Felicity. “It would be real wicked.”\n\n“I think we ought to sing a hymn, anyway,” asseverated Sara Ray.\n\n“Well, we might do that, if it isn’t a very religious one,” conceded\nFelicity.\n\n“How would ‘Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore,’ do?” asked\nCecily. “That never seemed to me a very religious hymn.”\n\n“But it doesn’t seem very appropriate to a funeral occasion either,”\n said Felicity.\n\n“I think ‘Lead, kindly light,’ would be ever so much more suitable,”\n suggested Sara Ray, “and it is kind of soothing and melancholy too.”\n\n“We are not going to sing anything,” said the Story Girl coldly. “Do\nyou want to make the affair ridiculous? We will just fill up the grave\nquietly and put a flat stone over the top.”\n\n“It isn’t much like my idea of a funeral,” muttered Sara Ray\ndiscontentedly.\n\n“Never mind, we’re going to have a real obituary about him in Our\nMagazine,” whispered Cecily consolingly.\n\n“And Peter is going to cut his name on top of the stone,” added\nFelicity. “Only we mustn’t let on to the grown-ups until it is done,\nbecause they might say it wasn’t right.”\n\nWe left the orchard, a sober little band, with the wind of the gray\ntwilight blowing round us. Uncle Roger passed us at the gate.\n\n“So the last sad obsequies are over?” he remarked with a grin.\n\nAnd we hated Uncle Roger. But we loved Uncle Blair because he said\nquietly,\n\n“And so you’ve buried your little comrade?”\n\nSo much may depend on the way a thing is said. But not even Uncle\nBlair’s sympathy could take the sting out of the fact that there was\nno Paddy to get the froth that night at milking time. Felicity cried\nbitterly all the time she was straining the milk. Many human beings have\ngone to their graves unattended by as much real regret as followed that\none gray pussy cat to his.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. PROPHECIES\n\n\n“Here’s a letter for you from father,” said Felix, tossing it to me as\nhe came through the orchard gate. We had been picking apples all day,\nbut were taking a mid-afternoon rest around the well, with a cup of its\nsparkling cold water to refresh us.\n\nI opened the letter rather indifferently, for father, with all his\nexcellent and lovable traits, was but a poor correspondent; his letters\nwere usually very brief and very unimportant.\n\nThis letter was brief enough, but it was freighted with a message of\nweighty import. I sat gazing stupidly at the sheet after I had read it\nuntil Felix exclaimed,\n\n“Bev, what’s the matter with you? What’s in that letter?”\n\n“Father is coming home,” I said dazedly. “He is to leave South America\nin a fortnight and will be here in November to take us back to Toronto.”\n\nEverybody gasped. Sara Ray, of course, began to cry, which aggravated me\nunreasonably.\n\n“Well,” said Felix, when he got his second wind, “I’ll be awful glad\nto see father again, but I tell you I don’t like the thought of leaving\nhere.”\n\nI felt exactly the same but, in view of Sara Ray’s tears, admit it I\nwould not; so I sat in grum silence while the other tongues wagged.\n\n“If I were not going away myself I’d feel just terrible,” said the Story\nGirl. “Even as it is I’m real sorry. I’d like to be able to think of\nyou as all here together when I’m gone, having good times and writing me\nabout them.”\n\n“It’ll be awfully dull when you fellows go,” muttered Dan.\n\n“I’m sure I don’t know what we’re ever going to do here this winter,”\n said Felicity, with the calmness of despair.\n\n“Thank goodness there are no more fathers to come back,” breathed Cecily\nwith a vicious earnestness that made us all laugh, even in the midst of\nour dismay.\n\nWe worked very half-heartedly the rest of the day, and it was not until\nwe assembled in the orchard in the evening that our spirits recovered\nsomething like their wonted level. It was clear and slightly frosty; the\nsun had declined behind a birch on a distant hill and it seemed a tree\nwith a blazing heart of fire. The great golden willow at the lane gate\nwas laughter-shaken in the wind of evening. Even amid all the changes of\nour shifting world we could not be hopelessly low-spirited--except Sara\nRay, who was often so, and Peter, who was rarely so. But Peter had been\nsorely vexed in spirit for several days. The time was approaching for\nthe October issue of Our Magazine and he had no genuine fiction ready\nfor it. He had taken so much to heart Felicity’s taunt that his stories\nwere all true that he had determined to have a really-truly false one\nin the next number. But the difficulty was to get anyone to write it. He\nhad asked the Story Girl to do it, but she refused; then he appealed to\nme and I shirked. Finally Peter determined to write a story himself.\n\n“It oughtn’t to be any harder than writing a poem and I managed that,”\n he said dolefully.\n\nHe worked at it in the evenings in the granary loft, and the rest of us\nforebore to question him concerning it, because he evidently disliked\ntalking about his literary efforts. But this evening I had to ask him if\nhe would soon have it ready, as I wanted to make up the paper.\n\n“It’s done,” said Peter, with an air of gloomy triumph. “It don’t amount\nto much, but anyhow I made it all out of my own head. Not one word of it\nwas ever printed or told before, and nobody can say there was.”\n\n“Then I guess we have all the stuff in and I’ll have Our Magazine ready\nto read by tomorrow night,” I said.\n\n“I s’pose it will be the last one we’ll have,” sighed Cecily. “We can’t\ncarry it on after you all go, and it has been such fun.”\n\n“Bev will be a real newspaper editor some day,” declared the Story Girl,\non whom the spirit of prophecy suddenly descended that night.\n\nShe was swinging on the bough of an apple tree, with a crimson shawl\nwrapped about her head, and her eyes were bright with roguish fire.\n\n“How do you know he will?” asked Felicity.\n\n“Oh, I can tell futures,” answered the Story Girl mysteriously. “I know\nwhat’s going to happen to all of you. Shall I tell you?”\n\n“Do, just for the fun of it,” I said. “Then some day we’ll know just how\nnear you came to guessing right. Go on. What else about me?”\n\n“You’ll write books, too, and travel all over the world,” continued the\nStory Girl. “Felix will be fat to the end of his life, and he will be a\ngrandfather before he is fifty, and he will wear a long black beard.”\n\n“I won’t,” cried Felix disgustedly. “I hate whiskers. Maybe I can’t help\nthe grandfather part, but I CAN help having a beard.”\n\n“You can’t. It’s written in the stars.”\n\n“‘Tain’t. The stars can’t prevent me from shaving.”\n\n“Won’t Grandpa Felix sound awful funny?” reflected Felicity.\n\n“Peter will be a minister,” went on the Story Girl.\n\n“Well, I might be something worse,” remarked Peter, in a not ungratified\ntone.\n\n“Dan will be a farmer and will marry a girl whose name begins with K and\nhe will have eleven children. And he’ll vote Grit.”\n\n“I won’t,” cried scandalized Dan. “You don’t know a thing about\nit. Catch ME ever voting Grit! As for the rest of it--I don’t care.\nFarming’s well enough, though I’d rather be a sailor.”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense,” protested Felicity sharply. “What on earth\ndo you want to be a sailor for and be drowned?”\n\n“All sailors aren’t drowned,” said Dan.\n\n“Most of them are. Look at Uncle Stephen.”\n\n“You ain’t sure he was drowned.”\n\n“Well, he disappeared, and that is worse.”\n\n“How do you know? Disappearing might be real easy.”\n\n“It’s not very easy for your family.”\n\n“Hush, let’s hear the rest of the predictions,” said Cecily.\n\n“Felicity,” resumed the Story Girl gravely, “will marry a minister.”\n\nSara Ray giggled and Felicity blushed. Peter tried hard not to look too\nself-consciously delighted.\n\n“She will be a perfect housekeeper and will teach a Sunday School class\nand be very happy all her life.”\n\n“Will her husband be happy?” queried Dan solemnly.\n\n“I guess he’ll be as happy as your wife,” retorted Felicity reddening.\n\n“He’ll be the happiest man in the world,” declared Peter warmly.\n\n“What about me?” asked Sara Ray.\n\nThe Story Girl looked rather puzzled. It was so hard to imagine Sara Ray\nas having any kind of future. Yet Sara was plainly anxious to have her\nfortune told and must be gratified.\n\n“You’ll be married,” said the Story Girl recklessly, “and you’ll live to\nbe nearly a hundred years old, and go to dozens of funerals and have a\ngreat many sick spells. You will learn not to cry after you are seventy;\nbut your husband will never go to church.”\n\n“I’m glad you warned me,” said Sara Ray solemnly, “because now I know\nI’ll make him promise before I marry him that he will go.”\n\n“He won’t keep the promise,” said the Story Girl, shaking her head. “But\nit is getting cold and Cecily is coughing. Let us go in.”\n\n“You haven’t told my fortune,” protested Cecily disappointedly.\n\nThe Story Girl looked very tenderly at Cecily--at the smooth little\nbrown head, at the soft, shining eyes, at the cheeks that were often\nover-rosy after slight exertion, at the little sunburned hands that were\nalways busy doing faithful work or quiet kindnesses. A very strange look\ncame over the Story Girl’s face; her eyes grew sad and far-reaching, as\nif of a verity they pierced beyond the mists of hidden years.\n\n“I couldn’t tell any fortune half good enough for you, dearest,” she\nsaid, slipping her arm round Cecily. “You deserve everything good and\nlovely. But you know I’ve only been in fun--of course I don’t know\nanything about what’s going to happen to us.”\n\n“Perhaps you know more than you think for,” said Sara Ray, who seemed\nmuch pleased with her fortune and anxious to believe it, despite the\nhusband who wouldn’t go to church.\n\n“But I’d like to be told my fortune, even in fun,” persisted Cecily.\n\n“Everybody you meet will love you as long as you live.” said the Story\nGirl. “There that’s the very nicest fortune I can tell you, and it will\ncome true whether the others do or not, and now we must go in.”\n\nWe went, Cecily still a little disappointed. In later years I often\nwondered why the Story Girl refused to tell her fortune that night.\nDid some strange gleam of foreknowledge fall for a moment across her\nmirth-making? Did she realize in a flash of prescience that there was\nno earthly future for our sweet Cecily? Not for her were to be the\nlengthening shadows or the fading garland. The end was to come while\nthe rainbow still sparkled on her wine of life, ere a single petal had\nfallen from her rose of joy. Long life was before all the others who\ntrysted that night in the old homestead orchard; but Cecily’s maiden\nfeet were never to leave the golden road.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. THE LAST NUMBER OF OUR MAGAZINE\n\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nIt is with heartfelt regret that we take up our pen to announce that\nthis will be the last number of Our Magazine. We have edited ten numbers\nof it and it has been successful beyond our expectations. It has to be\ndiscontinued by reason of circumstances over which we have no control\nand not because we have lost interest in it. Everybody has done his or\nher best for Our Magazine. Prince Edward Island expected everyone to do\nhis and her duty and everyone did it.\n\nMr. Dan King conducted the etiquette department in a way worthy of the\nFamily Guide itself. He is especially entitled to commendation because\nhe laboured under the disadvantage of having to furnish most of the\nquestions as well as the answers. Miss Felicity King has edited our\nhelpful household department very ably, and Miss Cecily King’s fashion\nnotes were always up to date. The personal column was well looked after\nby Miss Sara Stanley and the story page has been a marked success under\nthe able management of Mr. Peter Craig, to whose original story in\nthis issue, “The Battle of the Partridge Eggs,” we would call especial\nattention. The Exciting Adventure series has also been very popular.\n\nAnd now, in closing, we bid farewell to our staff and thank them one and\nall for their help and co-operation in the past year. We have enjoyed\nour work and we trust that they have too. We wish them all happiness\nand success in years to come, and we hope that the recollection of\nOur Magazine will not be held least dear among the memories of their\nchildhood.\n\n(SOBS FROM THE GIRLS): “INDEED IT WON’T!”\n\n\nOBITUARY\n\nOn October eighteenth, Patrick Grayfur departed for that bourne whence\nno traveller returns. He was only a cat, but he had been our faithful\nfriend for a long time and we aren’t ashamed to be sorry for him. There\nare lots of people who are not as friendly and gentlemanly as Paddy was,\nand he was a great mouser. We buried all that was mortal of poor Pat in\nthe orchard and we are never going to forget him. We have resolved\nthat whenever the date of his death comes round we’ll bow our heads and\npronounce his name at the hour of his funeral. If we are anywhere where\nwe can’t say the name out loud we’ll whisper it.\n\n\n“Farewell, dearest Paddy, in all the years that are to be We’ll cherish\nyour memory faithfully.”[1]\n\n\nMY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE\n\nMy most exciting adventure was the day I fell off Uncle Roger’s loft two\nyears ago. I wasn’t excited until it was all over because I hadn’t time\nto be. The Story Girl and I were looking for eggs in the loft. It was\nfilled with wheat straw nearly to the roof and it was an awful distance\nfrom us to the floor. And wheat straw is so slippery. I made a little\nspring and the straw slipped from under my feet and there I was going\nhead first down from the loft. It seemed to me I was an awful long time\nfalling, but the Story Girl says I couldn’t have been more than three\nseconds. But I know that I thought five thoughts and there seemed to be\nquite a long time between them. The first thing I thought was, what has\nhappened, because I really didn’t know at first, it was so sudden. Then\nafter a spell I thought the answer, I am falling off the loft. And then\nI thought, what will happen to me when I strike the floor, and after\nanother little spell I thought, I’ll be killed. And then I thought,\nwell, I don’t care. I really wasn’t a bit frightened. I just was quite\nwilling to be killed. If there hadn’t been a big pile of chaff on the\nbarn floor these words would never have been written. But there was and\nI fell on it and wasn’t a bit hurt, only my hair and mouth and eyes\nand ears got all full of chaff. The strange part is that I wasn’t a bit\nfrightened when I thought I was going to be killed, but after all the\ndanger was over I was awfully frightened and trembled so the Story Girl\nhad to help me into the house.\n\n                                     FELICITY KING.\n\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE PARTRIDGE EGGS\n\nOnce upon a time there lived about half a mile from a forrest a farmer\nand his wife and his sons and daughters and a granddaughter. The farmer\nand his wife loved this little girl very much but she caused them great\ntrouble by running away into the woods and they often spent haf days\nlooking for her. One day she wondered further into the forrest than\nusual and she begun to be hungry. Then night closed in. She asked a fox\nwhere she could get something to eat. The fox told her he knew where\nthere was a partridges nest and a bluejays nest full of eggs. So he led\nher to the nests and she took five eggs out of each. When the birds came\nhome they missed the eggs and flew into a rage. The bluejay put on his\ntopcoat and was going to the partridge for law when he met the partridge\ncoming to him. They lit up a fire and commenced sining their deeds when\nthey heard a tremendous howl close behind them. They jumped up and put\nout the fire and were immejutly attacked by five great wolves. The next\nday the little girl was rambelling through the woods when they saw her\nand took her prisoner. After she had confessed that she had stole the\neggs they told her to raise an army. They would have to fight over the\nnests of eggs and whoever one would have the eggs. So the partridge\nraised a great army of all kinds of birds except robins and the little\ngirl got all the robins and foxes and bees and wasps. And best of all\nthe little girl had a gun and plenty of ammunishun. The leader of her\narmy was a wolf. The result of the battle was that all the birds were\nkilled except the partridge and the bluejay and they were taken prisoner\nand starved to death.\n\nThe little girl was then taken prisoner by a witch and cast into a\ndunjun full of snakes where she died from their bites and people who\nwent through the forrest after that were taken prisoner by her ghost and\ncast into the same dunjun where they died. About a year after the wood\nturned into a gold castle and one morning everything had vanished except\na piece of a tree.\n\n                                       PETER CRAIG.\n\n\n\n(DAN, WITH A WHISTLE:--“Well, I guess nobody can say Peter can’t write\nfiction after THAT.”\n\nSARA RAY, WIPING AWAY HER TEARS:--“It’s a very interesting story, but it\nends SO sadly.”\n\nFELIX:--“What made you call it The Battle of the Partridge Eggs when the\nbluejay had just as much to do with it?”\n\nPETER, SHORTLY:--“Because it sounded better that way.”\n\nFELICITY:--“Did she eat the eggs raw?”\n\nSARA RAY:--“Poor little thing, I suppose if you’re starving you can’t be\nvery particular.”\n\nCECILY, SIGHING:--“I wish you’d let her go home safe, Peter, and not put\nher to such a cruel death.”\n\nBEVERLEY:--“I don’t quite understand where the little girl got her gun\nand ammunition.”\n\nPETER, SUSPECTING THAT HE IS BEING MADE FUN OF:--“If you could write a\nbetter story, why didn’t you? I give you the chance.”\n\nTHE STORY GIRL, WITH A PRETERNATURALLY SOLEMN FACE:--“You shouldn’t\ncriticize Peter’s story like that. It’s a fairy tale, you know, and\nanything can happen in a fairy tale.”\n\nFELICITY:--“There isn’t a word about fairies in it!”\n\nCECILY:--“Besides, fairy tales always end nicely and this doesn’t.”\n\nPETER, SULKILY:--“I wanted to punish her for running away from home.”\n\nDAN:--“Well, I guess you did it all right.”\n\nCECILY:--“Oh, well, it was very interesting, and that is all that is\nreally necessary in a story.” )\n\n\nPERSONALS\n\nMr. Blair Stanley is visiting friends and relatives in Carlisle. He\nintends returning to Europe shortly. His daughter, Miss Sara, will\naccompany him.\n\nMr. Alan King is expected home from South America next month. His sons\nwill return with him to Toronto. Beverley and Felix have made hosts of\nfriends during their stay in Carlisle and will be much missed in social\ncircles.\n\nThe Mission Band of Carlisle Presbyterian Church completed their\nmissionary quilt last week.

OUR LAST EVENING TOGETHER\n\n\nIT was the evening before the day on which the Story Girl and Uncle\nBlair were to leave us, and we were keeping our last tryst together\nin the orchard where we had spent so many happy hours. We had made a\npilgrimage to all the old haunts--the hill field, the spruce wood, the\ndairy, Grandfather King’s willow, the Pulpit Stone, Pat’s grave, and\nUncle Stephen’s Walk; and now we foregathered in the sere grasses about\nthe old well and feasted on the little jam turnovers Felicity had made\nthat day specially for the occasion.\n\n“I wonder if we’ll ever all be together again,” sighed Cecily.\n\n“I wonder when I’ll get jam turnovers like this again,” said the Story\nGirl, trying to be gay but not making much of a success of it.\n\n“If Paris wasn’t so far away I could send you a box of nice things\nnow and then,” said Felicity forlornly, “but I suppose there’s no use\nthinking of that. Dear knows what they’ll give you to eat over there.”\n\n“Oh, the French have the reputation of being the best cooks in the\nworld,” rejoined the Story Girl, “but I know they can’t beat your jam\nturnovers and plum puffs, Felicity. Many a time I’ll be hankering after\nthem.”\n\n“If we ever do meet again you’ll be grown up,” said Felicity gloomily.\n\n“Well, you won’t have stood still yourselves, you know.”\n\n“No, but that’s just the worst of it. We’ll all be different and\neverything will be changed.”\n\n“Just think,” said Cecily, “last New Year’s Eve we were wondering what\nwould happen this year; and what a lot of things have happened that we\nnever expected. Oh, dear!”\n\n“If things never happened life would be pretty dull,” said the Story\nGirl briskly. “Oh, don’t look so dismal, all of you.”\n\n“It’s hard to be cheerful when everybody’s going away,” sighed Cecily.\n\n“Well, let’s pretend to be, anyway,” insisted the Story Girl. “Don’t\nlet’s think of parting. Let’s think instead of how much we’ve laughed\nthis last year or so. I’m sure I shall never forget this dear old place.\nWe’ve had so many good times here.”\n\n“And some bad times, too,” reminded Felix.\n\n“Remember when Dan et the bad berries last summer?”\n\n“And the time we were so scared over that bell ringing in the house,”\n grinned Peter.\n\n“And the Judgment Day,” added Dan.\n\n“And the time Paddy was bewitched,” suggested Sara Ray.\n\n“And when Peter was dying of the measles,” said Felicity.\n\n“And the time Jimmy Patterson was lost,” said Dan. “Gee-whiz, but that\nscared me out of a year’s growth.”\n\n“Do you remember the time we took the magic seed,” grinned Peter.\n\n“Weren’t we silly?” said Felicity. “I really can never look Billy\nRobinson in the face when I meet him. I’m always sure he’s laughing at\nme in his sleeve.”\n\n“It’s Billy Robinson who ought to be ashamed when he meets you or any of\nus,” commented Cecily severely. “I’d rather be cheated than cheat other\npeople.”\n\n“Do you mind the time we bought God’s picture?” asked Peter.\n\n“I wonder if it’s where we buried it yet,” speculated Felix.\n\n“I put a stone over it, just as we did over Pat,” said Cecily.\n\n“I wish I could forget what God looks like,” sighed Sara Ray. “I can’t\nforget it--and I can’t forget what the bad place is like either, ever\nsince Peter preached that sermon on it.”\n\n“When you get to be a real minister you’ll have to preach that sermon\nover again, Peter,” grinned Dan.\n\n“My Aunt Jane used to say that people needed a sermon on that place once\nin a while,” retorted Peter seriously.\n\n“Do you mind the night I et the cucumbers and milk to make me dream?”\n said Cecily.\n\nAnd therewith we hunted out our old dream books to read them again, and,\nforgetful of coming partings, laughed over them till the old orchard\nechoed to our mirth. When we had finished we stood in a circle around\nthe well and pledged “eternal friendship” in a cup of its unrivalled\nwater.\n\nThen we joined hands and sang “Auld Lang Syne.” Sara Ray cried bitterly\nin lieu of singing.\n\n“Look here,” said the Story Girl, as we turned to leave the old orchard,\n“I want to ask a favour of you all. Don’t say good-bye to me tomorrow\nmorning.”\n\n“Why not?” demanded Felicity in astonishment.\n\n“Because it’s such a hopeless sort of word. Don’t let’s SAY it at all.\nJust see me off with a wave of your hands. It won’t seem half so bad\nthen. And don’t any of you cry if you can help it. I want to remember\nyou all smiling.”\n\nWe went out of the old orchard where the autumn night wind was beginning\nto make its weird music in the russet boughs, and shut the little gate\nbehind us. Our revels there were ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. THE STORY GIRL GOES\n\n\nThe morning dawned, rosy and clear and frosty. Everybody was up early,\nfor the travellers must leave in time to catch the nine o’clock train.\nThe horse was harnessed and Uncle Alec was waiting by the door. Aunt\nJanet was crying, but everybody else was making a valiant effort not to.\nThe Awkward Man and Mrs. Dale came to see the last of their favourite.\nMrs. Dale had brought her a glorious sheaf of chrysanthemums, and the\nAwkward Man gave her, quite gracefully, another little, old, limp book\nfrom his library.\n\n“Read it when you are sad or happy or lonely or discouraged or hopeful,”\n he said gravely.\n\n“He has really improved very much since he got married,” whispered\nFelicity to me.\n\nSara Stanley wore a smart new travelling suit and a blue felt hat with a\nwhite feather. She looked so horribly grown up in it that we felt as if\nshe were lost to us already.\n\nSara Ray had vowed tearfully the night before that she would be up in\nthe morning to say farewell. But at this juncture Judy Pineau appeared\nto say that Sara, with her usual luck, had a sore throat, and that her\nmother consequently would not permit her to come. So Sara had written\nher parting words in a three-cornered pink note.\n\n\n  “My OWN DARLING FRIEND:--WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS my feelings over not\n  being able to go up this morning to say good-bye to one I so\n  FONDLY ADORE.  When I think that I cannot SEE YOU AGAIN my heart\n  is almost TOO FULL FOR UTTERANCE.  But mother says I cannot and I\n  MUST OBEY.  But I will be present IN SPIRIT.  It just BREAKS MY\n  HEART that you are going SO FAR AWAY.  You have always been SO\n  KIND to me and never hurt my feelings AS SOME DO and I shall miss\n  you SO MUCH.  But I earnestly HOPE AND PRAY that you will be HAPPY\n  AND PROSPEROUS wherever YOUR LOT IS CAST and not be seasick on THE\n  GREAT OCEAN.  I hope you will find time AMONG YOUR MANY DUTIES to\n  write me a letter ONCE IN A WHILE.  I shall ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU\n  and please remember me.  I hope we WILL MEET AGAIN sometime, but\n  if not may we meet in A FAR BETTER WORLD where there are no SAD\n  PARTINGS.\n\n  “Your true and loving friend,\n\n                                           “SARA RAY”\n\n\n“Poor little Sara,” said the Story Girl, with a queer catch in her\nvoice, as she slipped the tear-blotted note into her pocket. “She isn’t\na bad little soul, and I’m sorry I couldn’t see her once more, though\nmaybe it’s just as well for she’d have to cry and set us all off. I\nWON’T cry. Felicity, don’t you dare. Oh, you dear, darling people, I\nlove you all so much and I’ll go on loving you always.”\n\n“Mind you write us every week at the very least,” said Felicity, winking\nfuriously.\n\n“Blair, Blair, watch over the child well,” said Aunt Janet. “Remember,\nshe has no mother.”\n\nThe Story Girl ran over to the buggy and climbed in. Uncle Blair\nfollowed her. Her arms were full of Mrs. Dale’s chrysanthemums, held\nclose up to her face, and her beautiful eyes shone softly at us over\nthem. No good-byes were said, as she wished. We all smiled bravely and\nwaved our hands as they drove out of the lane and down the moist red\nroad into the shadows of the fir wood in the valley. But we still stood\nthere, for we knew we should see the Story Girl once more. Beyond the\nfir wood was an open curve in the road and she had promised to wave a\nlast farewell as they passed around it.\n\nWe watched the curve in silence, standing in a sorrowful little group\nin the sunshine of the autumn morning. The delight of the world had been\nours on the golden road. It had enticed us with daisies and rewarded\nus with roses. Blossom and lyric had waited on our wishes. Thoughts,\ncareless and sweet, had visited us. Laughter had been our comrade and\nfearless Hope our guide. But now the shadow of change was over it.\n\n“There she is,” cried Felicity.\n\nThe Story Girl stood up and waved her chrysanthemums at us. We waved\nwildly back until the buggy had driven around the curve. Then we went\nslowly and silently back to the house. The Story Girl was gone."
