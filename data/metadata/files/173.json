Levin of Englewood, CO.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu\n\n\nby\n\nSax Rohmer\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n\"A GENTLEMAN to see you, Doctor.\"\n\nFrom across the common a clock sounded the half-hour.\n\n\"Ten-thirty!\" I said.  \"A late visitor.  Show him up, if you please.\"\n\nI pushed my writing aside and tilted the lamp-shade, as footsteps\nsounded on the landing.  The next moment I had jumped to my feet, for a\ntall, lean man, with his square-cut, clean-shaven face sun-baked to the\nhue of coffee, entered and extended both hands, with a cry:\n\n\"Good old Petrie!  Didn't expect me, I'll swear!\"\n\nIt was Nayland Smith--whom I had thought to be in Burma!\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, and gripped his hands hard, \"this is a delightful\nsurprise!  Whatever--however--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Petrie!\" he broke in.  \"Don't put it down to the sun!\" And\nhe put out the lamp, plunging the room into darkness.\n\nI was too surprised to speak.\n\n\"No doubt you will think me mad,\" he continued, and, dimly, I could see\nhim at the window, peering out into the road, \"but before you are many\nhours older you will know that I have good reason to be cautious.  Ah,\nnothing suspicious!  Perhaps I am first this time.\"  And, stepping back\nto the writing-table he relighted the lamp.\n\n\"Mysterious enough for you?\" he laughed, and glanced at my unfinished\nMS.  \"A story, eh?  From which I gather that the district is beastly\nhealthy--what, Petrie?  Well, I can put some material in your way that,\nif sheer uncanny mystery is a marketable commodity, ought to make you\nindependent of influenza and broken legs and shattered nerves and all\nthe rest.\"\n\nI surveyed him doubtfully, but there was nothing in his appearance to\njustify me in supposing him to suffer from delusions.  His eyes were\ntoo bright, certainly, and a hardness now had crept over his face.  I\ngot out the whisky and siphon, saying:\n\n\"You have taken your leave early?\"\n\n\"I am not on leave,\" he replied, and slowly filled his pipe.  \"I am on\nduty.\"\n\n\"On duty!\" I exclaimed.  \"What, are you moved to London or something?\"\n\n\"I have got a roving commission, Petrie, and it doesn't rest with me\nwhere I am to-day nor where I shall be to-morrow.\"\n\nThere was something ominous in the words, and, putting down my glass,\nits contents untasted, I faced round and looked him squarely in the\neyes.  \"Out with it!\" I said.  \"What is it all about?\"\n\nSmith suddenly stood up and stripped off his coat.  Rolling back his\nleft shirt-sleeve he revealed a wicked-looking wound in the fleshy part\nof the forearm.  It was quite healed, but curiously striated for an\ninch or so around.\n\n\"Ever seen one like it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" I confessed.  \"It appears to have been deeply\ncauterized.\"\n\n\"Right!  Very deeply!\" he rapped.  \"A barb steeped in the venom of a\nhamadryad went in there!\"\n\nA shudder I could not repress ran coldly through me at mention of that\nmost deadly of all the reptiles of the East.\n\n\"There's only one treatment,\" he continued, rolling his sleeve down\nagain, \"and that's with a sharp knife, a match, and a broken cartridge.\nI lay on my back, raving, for three days afterwards, in a forest that\nstank with malaria, but I should have been lying there now if I had\nhesitated.  Here's the point.  It was not an accident!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that it was a deliberate attempt on my life, and I am hard upon\nthe tracks of the man who extracted that venom--patiently, drop by\ndrop--from the poison-glands of the snake, who prepared that arrow, and\nwho caused it to be shot at me.\"\n\n\"What fiend is this?\"\n\n\"A fiend who, unless my calculations are at fault is now in London, and\nwho regularly wars with pleasant weapons of that kind.  Petrie, I have\ntraveled from Burma not in the interests of the British Government\nmerely, but in the interests of the entire white race, and I honestly\nbelieve--though I pray I may be wrong--that its survival depends\nlargely upon the success of my mission.\"\n\nTo say that I was perplexed conveys no idea of the mental chaos created\nby these extraordinary statements, for into my humdrum suburban life\nNayland Smith had brought fantasy of the wildest.  I did not know what\nto think, what to believe.\n\n\"I am wasting precious time!\" he rapped decisively, and, draining his\nglass, he stood up.  \"I came straight to you, because you are the only\nman I dare to trust.  Except the big chief at headquarters, you are the\nonly person in England, I hope, who knows that Nayland Smith has\nquitted Burma.  I must have someone with me, Petrie, all the time--it's\nimperative!  Can you put me up here, and spare a few days to the\nstrangest business, I promise you, that ever was recorded in fact or\nfiction?\"\n\nI agreed readily enough, for, unfortunately, my professional duties\nwere not onerous.\n\n\"Good man!\" he cried, wringing my hand in his impetuous way.  \"We start\nnow.\"\n\n\"What, to-night?\"\n\n\"To-night!  I had thought of turning in, I must admit.  I have not\ndared to sleep for forty-eight hours, except in fifteen-minute\nstretches.  But there is one move that must be made to-night and\nimmediately.  I must warn Sir Crichton Davey.\"\n\n\"Sir Crichton Davey--of the India--\"\n\n\"Petrie, he is a doomed man!  Unless he follows my instructions without\nquestion, without hesitation--before Heaven, nothing can save him!  I\ndo not know when the blow will fall, how it will fall, nor from whence,\nbut I know that my first duty is to warn him.  Let us walk down to the\ncorner of the common and get a taxi.\"\n\nHow strangely does the adventurous intrude upon the humdrum; for, when\nit intrudes at all, more often than not its intrusion is sudden and\nunlooked for.  To-day, we may seek for romance and fail to find it:\nunsought, it lies in wait for us at most prosaic corners of life's\nhighway.\n\nThe drive that night, though it divided the drably commonplace from the\nwildly bizarre--though it was the bridge between the ordinary and the\noutre--has left no impression upon my mind.  Into the heart of a weird\nmystery the cab bore me; and in reviewing my memories of those days I\nwonder that the busy thoroughfares through which we passed did not\ndisplay before my eyes signs and portents--warnings.\n\nIt was not so.  I recall nothing of the route and little of import that\npassed between us (we both were strangely silent, I think) until we\nwere come to our journey's end.  Then:\n\n\"What's this?\" muttered my friend hoarsely.\n\nConstables were moving on a little crowd of curious idlers who pressed\nabout the steps of Sir Crichton Davey's house and sought to peer in at\nthe open door.  Without waiting for the cab to draw up to the curb,\nNayland Smith recklessly leaped out and I followed close at his heels.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he demanded breathlessly of a constable.\n\nThe latter glanced at him doubtfully, but something in his voice and\nbearing commanded respect.\n\n\"Sir Crichton Davey has been killed, sir.\"\n\nSmith lurched back as though he had received a physical blow, and\nclutched my shoulder convulsively.  Beneath the heavy tan his face had\nblanched, and his eyes were set in a stare of horror.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered.  \"I am too late!\"\n\nWith clenched fists he turned and, pressing through the group of\nloungers, bounded up the steps.  In the hall a man who unmistakably was\na Scotland Yard official stood talking to a footman.  Other members of\nthe household were moving about, more or less aimlessly, and the chilly\nhand of King Fear had touched one and all, for, as they came and went,\nthey glanced ever over their shoulders, as if each shadow cloaked a\nmenace, and listened, as it seemed, for some sound which they dreaded\nto hear.  Smith strode up to the detective and showed him a card, upon\nglancing at which the Scotland Yard man said something in a low voice,\nand, nodding, touched his hat to Smith in a respectful manner.\n\nA few brief questions and answers, and, in gloomy silence, we followed\nthe detective up the heavily carpeted stair, along a corridor lined\nwith pictures and busts, and into a large library.  A group of people\nwere in this room, and one, in whom I recognized Chalmers Cleeve, of\nHarley Street, was bending over a motionless form stretched upon a\ncouch.  Another door communicated with a small study, and through the\nopening I could see a man on all fours examining the carpet.  The\nuncomfortable sense of hush, the group about the physician, the bizarre\nfigure crawling, beetle-like, across the inner room, and the grim hub,\naround which all this ominous activity turned, made up a scene that\netched itself indelibly on my mind.\n\nAs we entered Dr. Cleeve straightened himself, frowning thoughtfully.\n\n\"Frankly, I do not care to venture any opinion at present regarding the\nimmediate cause of death,\" he said.  \"Sir Crichton was addicted to\ncocaine, but there are indications which are not in accordance with\ncocaine-poisoning. I fear that only a post-mortem can establish the\nfacts--if,\" he added, \"we ever arrive at them.  A most mysterious case!\"\n\nSmith stepping forward and engaging the famous pathologist in\nconversation, I seized the opportunity to examine Sir Crichton's body.\n\nThe dead man was in evening dress, but wore an old smoking-jacket. He\nhad been of spare but hardy build, with thin, aquiline features, which\nnow were oddly puffy, as were his clenched hands.  I pushed back his\nsleeve, and saw the marks of the hypodermic syringe upon his left arm.\nQuite mechanically I turned my attention to the right arm.  It was\nunscarred, but on the back of the hand was a faint red mark, not unlike\nthe imprint of painted lips.  I examined it closely, and even tried to\nrub it off, but it evidently was caused by some morbid process of local\ninflammation, if it were not a birthmark.\n\nTurning to a pale young man whom I had understood to be Sir Crichton's\nprivate secretary, I drew his attention to this mark, and inquired if\nit were constitutional.  \"It is not, sir,\" answered Dr. Cleeve,\noverhearing my question.  \"I have already made that inquiry.  Does it\nsuggest anything to your mind?  I must confess that it affords me no\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I replied.  \"It is most curious.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Burboyne,\" said Smith, now turning to the secretary,\n\"but Inspector Weymouth will tell you that I act with authority.  I\nunderstand that Sir Crichton was--seized with illness in his study?\"\n\n\"Yes--at half-past ten.  I was working here in the library, and he\ninside, as was our custom.\"\n\n\"The communicating door was kept closed?\"\n\n\"Yes, always.  It was open for a minute or less about ten-twenty-five,\nwhen a message came for Sir Crichton.  I took it in to him, and he then\nseemed in his usual health.\"\n\n\"What was the message?\"\n\n\"I could not say.  It was brought by a district messenger, and he\nplaced it beside him on the table.  It is there now, no doubt.\"\n\n\"And at half-past ten?\"\n\n\"Sir Crichton suddenly burst open the door and threw himself, with a\nscream, into the library.  I ran to him but he waved me back.  His eyes\nwere glaring horribly.  I had just reached his side when he fell,\nwrithing, upon the floor.  He seemed past speech, but as I raised him\nand laid him upon the couch, he gasped something that sounded like 'The\nred hand!' Before I could get to bell or telephone he was dead!\"\n\nMr. Burboyne's voice shook as he spoke the words, and Smith seemed to\nfind this evidence confusing.\n\n\"You do not think he referred to the mark on his own hand?\"\n\n\"I think not.  From the direction of his last glance, I feel sure he\nreferred to something in the study.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"Having summoned the servants, I ran into the study. But there was\nabsolutely nothing unusual to be seen.  The windows were closed and\nfastened.  He worked with closed windows in the hottest weather.  There\nis no other door, for the study occupies the end of a narrow wing, so\nthat no one could possibly have gained access to it, whilst I was in\nthe library, unseen by me.  Had someone concealed himself in the study\nearlier in the evening--and I am convinced that it offers no\nhiding-place--he could only have come out again by passing through\nhere.\"\n\nNayland Smith tugged at the lobe of his left ear, as was his habit when\nmeditating.\n\n\"You had been at work here in this way for some time?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Sir Crichton was preparing an important book.\"\n\n\"Had anything unusual occurred prior to this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Burboyne, with evident perplexity; \"though I attached\nno importance to it at the time.  Three nights ago Sir Crichton came\nout to me, and appeared very nervous; but at times his nerves--you\nknow?  Well, on this occasion he asked me to search the study.  He had\nan idea that something was concealed there.\"\n\n\"Some THING or someone?\"\n\n\"'Something' was the word he used.  I searched, but fruitlessly, and he\nseemed quite satisfied, and returned to his work.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Burboyne.  My friend and I would like a few minutes'\nprivate investigation in the study.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nSIR CRICHTON DAVEY'S study was a small one, and a glance sufficed to\nshow that, as the secretary had said, it offered no hiding-place. It\nwas heavily carpeted, and over-full of Burmese and Chinese ornaments\nand curios, and upon the mantelpiece stood several framed photographs\nwhich showed this to be the sanctum of a wealthy bachelor who was no\nmisogynist.  A map of the Indian Empire occupied the larger part of one\nwall.  The grate was empty, for the weather was extremely warm, and a\ngreen-shaded lamp on the littered writing-table afforded the only\nlight.  The air was stale, for both windows were closed and fastened.\n\nSmith immediately pounced upon a large, square envelope that lay beside\nthe blotting-pad. Sir Crichton had not even troubled to open it, but my\nfriend did so.  It contained a blank sheet of paper!\n\n\"Smell!\" he directed, handing the letter to me.  I raised it to my\nnostrils.  It was scented with some pungent perfume.\n\n\"What is it?\"  I asked.\n\n\"It is a rather rare essential oil,\" was the reply, \"which I have met\nwith before, though never in Europe.  I begin to understand, Petrie.\"\n\nHe tilted the lamp-shade and made a close examination of the scraps of\npaper, matches, and other debris that lay in the grate and on the\nhearth.  I took up a copper vase from the mantelpiece, and was\nexamining it curiously, when he turned, a strange expression upon his\nface.\n\n\"Put that back, old man,\" he said quietly.\n\nMuch surprised, I did as he directed.\n\n\"Don't touch anything in the room.  It may be dangerous.\"\n\nSomething in the tone of his voice chilled me, and I hastily replaced\nthe vase, and stood by the door of the study, watching him search,\nmethodically, every inch of the room--behind the books, in all the\nornaments, in table drawers, in cupboards, on shelves.\n\n\"That will do,\" he said at last.  \"There is nothing here and I have no\ntime to search farther.\"\n\nWe returned to the library.\n\n\"Inspector Weymouth,\" said my friend, \"I have a particular reason for\nasking that Sir Crichton's body be removed from this room at once and\nthe library locked.  Let no one be admitted on any pretense whatever\nuntil you hear from me.\" It spoke volumes for the mysterious\ncredentials borne by my friend that the man from Scotland Yard accepted\nhis orders without demur, and, after a brief chat with Mr. Burboyne,\nSmith passed briskly downstairs.  In the hall a man who looked like a\ngroom out of livery was waiting.\n\n\"Are you Wills?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"It was you who heard a cry of some kind at the rear of the house about\nthe time of Sir Crichton's death?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I was locking the garage door, and, happening to look up at\nthe window of Sir Crichton's study, I saw him jump out of his chair.\nWhere he used to sit at his writing, sir, you could see his shadow on\nthe blind.  Next minute I heard a call out in the lane.\"\n\n\"What kind of call?\"\n\nThe man, whom the uncanny happening clearly had frightened, seemed\npuzzled for a suitable description.\n\n\"A sort of wail, sir,\" he said at last.  \"I never heard anything like\nit before, and don't want to again.\"\n\n\"Like this?\" inquired Smith, and he uttered a low, wailing cry,\nimpossible to describe.  Wills perceptibly shuddered; and, indeed, it\nwas an eerie sound.\n\n\"The same, sir, I think,\" he said, \"but much louder.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Smith, and I thought I detected a note of triumph\nin his voice.  \"But stay!  Take us through to the back of the house.\"\n\nThe man bowed and led the way, so that shortly we found ourselves in a\nsmall, paved courtyard.  It was a perfect summer's night, and the deep\nblue vault above was jeweled with myriads of starry points.  How\nimpossible it seemed to reconcile that vast, eternal calm with the\nhideous passions and fiendish agencies which that night had loosed a\nsoul upon the infinite.\n\n\"Up yonder are the study windows, sir.  Over that wall on your left is\nthe back lane from which the cry came, and beyond is Regent's Park.\"\n\n\"Are the study windows visible from there?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Who occupies the adjoining house?\"\n\n\"Major-General Platt-Houston, sir; but the family is out of town.\"\n\n\"Those iron stairs are a means of communication between the domestic\noffices and the servants' quarters, I take it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then send someone to make my business known to the Major-General's\nhousekeeper; I want to examine those stairs.\"\n\nSingular though my friend's proceedings appeared to me, I had ceased to\nwonder at anything.  Since Nayland Smith's arrival at my rooms I seemed\nto have been moving through the fitful phases of a nightmare.  My\nfriend's account of how he came by the wound in his arm; the scene on\nour arrival at the house of Sir Crichton Davey; the secretary's story\nof the dying man's cry, \"The red hand!\"; the hidden perils of the\nstudy; the wail in the lane--all were fitter incidents of delirium than\nof sane reality.  So, when a white-faced butler made us known to a\nnervous old lady who proved to be the housekeeper of the next-door\nresidence, I was not surprised at Smith's saying:\n\n\"Lounge up and down outside, Petrie.  Everyone has cleared off now.  It\nis getting late.  Keep your eyes open and be on your guard.  I thought\nI had the start, but he is here before me, and, what is worse, he\nprobably knows by now that I am here, too.\"\n\nWith which he entered the house and left me out in the square, with\nleisure to think, to try to understand.\n\nThe crowd which usually haunts the scene of a sensational crime had\nbeen cleared away, and it had been circulated that Sir Crichton had\ndied from natural causes.  The intense heat having driven most of the\nresidents out of town, practically I had the square to myself, and I\ngave myself up to a brief consideration of the mystery in which I so\nsuddenly had found myself involved.\n\nBy what agency had Sir Crichton met his death?  Did Nayland Smith know?\nI rather suspected that he did.  What was the hidden significance of\nthe perfumed envelope?  Who was that mysterious personage whom Smith so\nevidently dreaded, who had attempted his life, who, presumably, had\nmurdered Sir Crichton?  Sir Crichton Davey, during the time that he had\nheld office in India, and during his long term of service at home, had\nearned the good will of all, British and native alike.  Who was his\nsecret enemy?\n\nSomething touched me lightly on the shoulder.\n\nI turned, with my heart fluttering like a child's. This night's work\nhad imposed a severe strain even upon my callous nerves.\n\nA girl wrapped in a hooded opera-cloak stood at my elbow, and, as she\nglanced up at me, I thought that I never had seen a face so seductively\nlovely nor of so unusual a type.  With the skin of a perfect blonde,\nshe had eyes and lashes as black as a Creole's, which, together with\nher full red lips, told me that this beautiful stranger, whose touch\nhad so startled me, was not a child of our northern shores.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said, speaking with an odd, pretty accent, and laying\na slim hand, with jeweled fingers, confidingly upon my arm, \"if I\nstartled you.  But--is it true that Sir Crichton Davey has\nbeen--murdered?\"\n\nI looked into her big, questioning eyes, a harsh suspicion laboring in\nmy mind, but could read nothing in their mysterious depths--only I\nwondered anew at my questioner's beauty.  The grotesque idea\nmomentarily possessed me that, were the bloom of her red lips due to\nart and not to nature, their kiss would leave--though not\nindelibly--just such a mark as I had seen upon the dead man's hand.\nBut I dismissed the fantastic notion as bred of the night's horrors,\nand worthy only of a mediaeval legend.  No doubt she was some friend or\nacquaintance of Sir Crichton who lived close by.\n\n\"I cannot say that he has been murdered,\" I replied, acting upon the\nlatter supposition, and seeking to tell her what she asked as gently as\npossible.\n\n\"But he is--Dead?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\nShe closed her eyes and uttered a low, moaning sound, swaying dizzily.\nThinking she was about to swoon, I threw my arm round her shoulder to\nsupport her, but she smiled sadly, and pushed me gently away.\n\n\"I am quite well, thank you,\" she said.\n\n\"You are certain?  Let me walk with you until you feel quite sure of\nyourself.\"\n\nShe shook her head, flashed a rapid glance at me with her beautiful\neyes, and looked away in a sort of sorrowful embarrassment, for which I\nwas entirely at a loss to account.  Suddenly she resumed:\n\n\"I cannot let my name be mentioned in this dreadful matter, but--I\nthink I have some information--for the police.  Will you give this\nto--whomever you think proper?\"\n\nShe handed me a sealed envelope, again met my eyes with one of her\ndazzling glances, and hurried away.  She had gone no more than ten or\ntwelve yards, and I still was standing bewildered, watching her\ngraceful, retreating figure, when she turned abruptly and came back.\n\nWithout looking directly at me, but alternately glancing towards a\ndistant corner of the square and towards the house of Major-General\nPlatt-Houston, she made the following extraordinary request:\n\n\"If you would do me a very great service, for which I always would be\ngrateful,\"--she glanced at me with passionate intentness--\"when you\nhave given my message to the proper person, leave him and do not go\nnear him any more to-night!\"\n\nBefore I could find words to reply she gathered up her cloak and ran.\nBefore I could determine whether or not to follow her (for her words\nhad aroused anew all my worst suspicions) she had disappeared!  I heard\nthe whir of a restarted motor at no great distance, and, in the instant\nthat Nayland Smith came running down the steps, I knew that I had\nnodded at my post.\n\n\"Smith!\"  I cried as he joined me, \"tell me what we must do!\" And\nrapidly I acquainted him with the incident.\n\nMy friend looked very grave; then a grim smile crept round his lips.\n\n\"She was a big card to play,\" he said; \"but he did not know that I held\none to beat it.\"\n\n\"What!  You know this girl!  Who is she?\"\n\n\"She is one of the finest weapons in the enemy's armory, Petrie.  But a\nwoman is a two-edged sword, and treacherous.  To our great good\nfortune, she has formed a sudden predilection, characteristically\nOriental, for yourself.  Oh, you may scoff, but it is evident.  She was\nemployed to get this letter placed in my hands.  Give it to me.\"\n\nI did so.\n\n\"She has succeeded.  Smell.\"\n\nHe held the envelope under my nose, and, with a sudden sense of nausea,\nI recognized the strange perfume.\n\n\"You know what this presaged in Sir Crichton's case?  Can you doubt any\nlonger?  She did not want you to share my fate, Petrie.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I said unsteadily, \"I have followed your lead blindly in this\nhorrible business and have not pressed for an explanation, but I must\ninsist before I go one step farther upon knowing what it all means.\"\n\n\"Just a few steps farther,\" he rejoined; \"as far as a cab.  We are\nhardly safe here.  Oh, you need not fear shots or knives.  The man\nwhose servants are watching us now scorns to employ such clumsy,\ntell-tale weapons.\"\n\nOnly three cabs were on the rank, and, as we entered the first,\nsomething hissed past my ear, missed both Smith and me by a miracle,\nand, passing over the roof of the taxi, presumably fell in the enclosed\ngarden occupying the center of the square.\n\n\"What was that?\" I cried.\n\n\"Get in--quickly!\"  Smith rapped back.  \"It was attempt number one!\nMore than that I cannot say.  Don't let the man hear.  He has noticed\nnothing.  Pull up the window on your side, Petrie, and look out behind.\nGood!  We've started.\"\n\nThe cab moved off with a metallic jerk, and I turned and looked back\nthrough the little window in the rear.\n\n\"Someone has got into another cab.  It is following ours, I think.\"\n\nNayland Smith lay back and laughed unmirthfully.\n\n\"Petrie,\" he said, \"if I escape alive from this business I shall know\nthat I bear a charmed life.\"\n\nI made no reply, as he pulled out the dilapidated pouch and filled his\npipe.\n\n\"You have asked me to explain matters,\" he continued, \"and I will do so\nto the best of my ability.  You no doubt wonder why a servant of the\nBritish Government, lately stationed in Burma, suddenly appears in\nLondon, in the character of a detective.  I am here, Petrie--and I bear\ncredentials from the very highest sources--because, quite by accident,\nI came upon a clew.  Following it up, in the ordinary course of\nroutine, I obtained evidence of the existence and malignant activity of\na certain man.  At the present stage of the case I should not be\njustified in terming him the emissary of an Eastern Power, but I may\nsay that representations are shortly to be made to that Power's\nambassador in London.\"\n\nHe paused and glanced back towards the pursuing cab.\n\n\"There is little to fear until we arrive home,\" he said calmly.\n\"Afterwards there is much.  To continue:  This man, whether a fanatic\nor a duly appointed agent, is, unquestionably, the most malign and\nformidable personality existing in the known world today.  He is a\nlinguist who speaks with almost equal facility in any of the civilized\nlanguages, and in most of the barbaric.  He is an adept in all the arts\nand sciences which a great university could teach him.  He also is an\nadept in certain obscure arts and sciences which no university of\nto-day can teach.  He has the brains of any three men of genius.\nPetrie, he is a mental giant.\"\n\n\"You amaze me!\" I said.\n\n\"As to his mission among men.  Why did M. Jules Furneaux fall dead in a\nParis opera house?  Because of heart failure?  No!  Because his last\nspeech had shown that he held the key to the secret of Tongking.  What\nbecame of the Grand Duke Stanislaus?  Elopement?  Suicide?  Nothing of\nthe kind.  He alone was fully alive to Russia's growing peril.  He\nalone knew the truth about Mongolia.  Why was Sir Crichton Davey\nmurdered?  Because, had the work he was engaged upon ever seen the\nlight it would have shown him to be the only living Englishman who\nunderstood the importance of the Tibetan frontiers.  I say to you\nsolemnly, Petrie, that these are but a few.  Is there a man who would\narouse the West to a sense of the awakening of the East, who would\nteach the deaf to hear, the blind to see, that the millions only await\ntheir leader?  He will die.  And this is only one phase of the devilish\ncampaign.  The others I can merely surmise.\"\n\n\"But, Smith, this is almost incredible!  What perverted genius controls\nthis awful secret movement?\"\n\n\"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered, with a brow\nlike Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven skull, and long,\nmagnetic eyes of the true cat-green. Invest him with all the cruel\ncunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant intellect,\nwith all the resources of science past and present, with all the\nresources, if you will, of a wealthy government--which, however,\nalready has denied all knowledge of his existence.  Imagine that awful\nbeing, and you have a mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the yellow peril\nincarnate in one man.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nI SANK into an arm-chair in my rooms and gulped down a strong peg of\nbrandy.\n\n\"We have been followed here,\" I said.  \"Why did you make no attempt to\nthrow the pursuers off the track, to have them intercepted?\"\n\nSmith laughed.\n\n\"Useless, in the first place.  Wherever we went, HE would find us.  And\nof what use to arrest his creatures?  We could prove nothing against\nthem.  Further, it is evident that an attempt is to be made upon my\nlife to-night--and by the same means that proved so successful in the\ncase of poor Sir Crichton.\"\n\nHis square jaw grew truculently prominent, and he leapt stormily to his\nfeet, shaking his clenched fists towards the window.\n\n\"The villain!\" he cried.  \"The fiendishly clever villain!  I suspected\nthat Sir Crichton was next, and I was right.  But I came too late,\nPetrie!  That hits me hard, old man.  To think that I knew and yet\nfailed to save him!\"\n\nHe resumed his seat, smoking hard.\n\n\"Fu-Manchu has made the blunder common to all men of unusual genius,\"\nhe said.  \"He has underrated his adversary.  He has not given me credit\nfor perceiving the meaning of the scented messages.  He has thrown away\none powerful weapon--to get such a message into my hands--and he thinks\nthat once safe within doors, I shall sleep, unsuspecting, and die as\nSir Crichton died.  But without the indiscretion of your charming\nfriend, I should have known what to expect when I receive her\n'information'--which by the way, consists of a blank sheet of paper.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I broke in, \"who is she?\"\n\n\"She is either Fu-Manchu's daughter, his wife, or his slave.  I am\ninclined to believe the last, for she has no will but his will,\nexcept\"--with a quizzical glance--\"in a certain instance.\"\n\n\"How can you jest with some awful thing--Heaven knows what--hanging\nover your head?  What is the meaning of these perfumed envelopes?  How\ndid Sir Crichton die?\"\n\n\"He died of the Zayat Kiss.  Ask me what that is and I reply 'I do not\nknow.'  The zayats are the Burmese caravanserais, or rest-houses. Along\na certain route--upon which I set eyes, for the first and only time,\nupon Dr. Fu-Manchu--travelers who use them sometimes die as Sir\nCrichton died, with nothing to show the cause of death but a little\nmark upon the neck, face, or limb, which has earned, in those parts,\nthe title of the 'Zayat Kiss.' The rest-houses along that route are\nshunned now.  I have my theory and I hope to prove it to-night, if I\nlive.  It will be one more broken weapon in his fiendish armory, and it\nis thus, and thus only, that I can hope to crush him.  This was my\nprincipal reason for not enlightening Dr. Cleeve.  Even walls have ears\nwhere Fu-Manchu is concerned, so I feigned ignorance of the meaning of\nthe mark, knowing that he would be almost certain to employ the same\nmethods upon some other victim.  I wanted an opportunity to study the\nZayat Kiss in operation, and I shall have one.\"\n\n\"But the scented envelopes?\"\n\n\"In the swampy forests of the district I have referred to a rare\nspecies of orchid, almost green, and with a peculiar scent, is\nsometimes met with.  I recognized the heavy perfume at once.  I take it\nthat the thing which kills the traveler is attracted by this orchid.\nYou will notice that the perfume clings to whatever it touches.  I\ndoubt if it can be washed off in the ordinary way.  After at least one\nunsuccessful attempt to kill Sir Crichton--you recall that he thought\nthere was something concealed in his study on a previous\noccasion?--Fu-Manchu hit upon the perfumed envelopes.  He may have a\nsupply of these green orchids in his possession--possibly to feed the\ncreature.\"\n\n\"What creature?  How could any kind of creature have got into Sir\nCrichton's room tonight?\"\n\n\"You no doubt observed that I examined the grate of the study.  I found\na fair quantity of fallen soot.  I at once assumed, since it appeared\nto be the only means of entrance, that something has been dropped down;\nand I took it for granted that the thing, whatever it was, must still\nbe concealed either in the study or in the library.  But when I had\nobtained the evidence of the groom, Wills, I perceived that the cry\nfrom the lane or from the park was a signal.  I noted that the\nmovements of anyone seated at the study table were visible, in shadow,\non the blind, and that the study occupied the corner of a two-storied\nwing and, therefore, had a short chimney.  What did the signal mean?\nThat Sir Crichton had leaped up from his chair, and either had received\nthe Zayat Kiss or had seen the thing which someone on the roof had\nlowered down the straight chimney.  It was the signal to withdraw that\ndeadly thing.  By means of the iron stairway at the rear of\nMajor-General Platt-Houston's, I quite easily, gained access to the\nroof above Sir Crichton's study--and I found this.\"\n\nOut from his pocket Nayland Smith drew a tangled piece of silk, mixed\nup with which were a brass ring and a number of unusually large-sized\nsplit-shot, nipped on in the manner usual on a fishing-line.\n\n\"My theory proven,\" he resumed.  \"Not anticipating a search on the\nroof, they had been careless.  This was to weight the line and to\nprevent the creature clinging to the walls of the chimney.  Directly it\nhad dropped in the grate, however, by means of this ring I assume that\nthe weighted line was withdrawn, and the thing was only held by one\nslender thread, which sufficed, though, to draw it back again when it\nhad done its work.  It might have got tangled, of course, but they\nreckoned on its making straight up the carved leg of the writing-table\nfor the prepared envelope.  From there to the hand of Sir\nCrichton--which, from having touched the envelope, would also be\nscented with the perfume--was a certain move.\"\n\n\"My God!  How horrible!\" I exclaimed, and glanced apprehensively into\nthe dusky shadows of the room.  \"What is your theory respecting this\ncreature--what shape, what color--?\"\n\n\"It is something that moves rapidly and silently.  I will venture no\nmore at present, but I think it works in the dark.  The study was dark,\nremember, save for the bright patch beneath the reading-lamp. I have\nobserved that the rear of this house is ivy-covered right up to and\nabove your bedroom.  Let us make ostentatious preparations to retire,\nand I think we may rely upon Fu-Manchu's servants to attempt my\nremoval, at any rate--if not yours.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow, it is a climb of thirty-five feet at the very\nleast.\"\n\n\"You remember the cry in the back lane?  It suggested something to me,\nand I tested my idea--successfully.  It was the cry of a dacoit.  Oh,\ndacoity, though quiescent, is by no means extinct.  Fu-Manchu has\ndacoits in his train, and probably it is one who operates the Zayat\nKiss, since it was a dacoit who watched the window of the study this\nevening.  To such a man an ivy-covered wall is a grand staircase.\"\n\nThe horrible events that followed are punctuated, in my mind, by the\nstriking of a distant clock.  It is singular how trivialities thus\nassert themselves in moments of high tension.  I will proceed, then, by\nthese punctuations, to the coming of the horror that it was written we\nshould encounter.\n\nThe clock across the common struck two.\n\nHaving removed all traces of the scent of the orchid from our hands\nwith a solution of ammonia Smith and I had followed the programme laid\ndown.  It was an easy matter to reach the rear of the house, by simply\nclimbing a fence, and we did not doubt that seeing the light go out in\nthe front, our unseen watcher would proceed to the back.\n\nThe room was a large one, and we had made up my camp-bed at one end,\nstuffing odds and ends under the clothes to lend the appearance of a\nsleeper, which device we also had adopted in the case of the larger\nbed.  The perfumed envelope lay upon a little coffee table in the\ncenter of the floor, and Smith, with an electric pocket lamp, a\nrevolver, and a brassey beside him, sat on cushions in the shadow of\nthe wardrobe.  I occupied a post between the windows.\n\nNo unusual sound, so far, had disturbed the stillness of the night.\nSave for the muffled throb of the rare all-night cars passing the front\nof the house, our vigil had been a silent one.  The full moon had\npainted about the floor weird shadows of the clustering ivy, spreading\nthe design gradually from the door, across the room, past the little\ntable where the envelope lay, and finally to the foot of the bed.\n\nThe distant clock struck a quarter-past two.\n\nA slight breeze stirred the ivy, and a new shadow added itself to the\nextreme edge of the moon's design.\n\nSomething rose, inch by inch, above the sill of the westerly window.  I\ncould see only its shadow, but a sharp, sibilant breath from Smith told\nme that he, from his post, could see the cause of the shadow.\n\nEvery nerve in my body seemed to be strung tensely.  I was icy cold,\nexpectant, and prepared for whatever horror was upon us.\n\nThe shadow became stationary.  The dacoit was studying the interior of\nthe room.\n\nThen it suddenly lengthened, and, craning my head to the left, I saw a\nlithe, black-clad form, surmounted by a Yellow face, sketchy in the\nmoonlight, pressed against the window-panes!\n\nOne thin, brown hand appeared over the edge of the lowered sash, which\nit grasped--and then another.  The man made absolutely no sound\nwhatever.  The second hand disappeared--and reappeared.  It held a\nsmall, square box.  There was a very faint CLICK.\n\nThe dacoit swung himself below the window with the agility of an ape,\nas, with a dull, muffled thud, SOMETHING dropped upon the carpet!\n\n\"Stand still, for your life!\" came Smith's voice, high-pitched.\n\nA beam of white leaped out across the room and played full upon the\ncoffee-table in the center.\n\nPrepared as I was for something horrible, I know that I paled at sight\nof the thing that was running round the edge of the envelope.\n\nIt was an insect, full six inches long, and of a vivid, venomous, red\ncolor!  It had something of the appearance of a great ant, with its\nlong, quivering antennae and its febrile, horrible vitality; but it was\nproportionately longer of body and smaller of head, and had numberless\nrapidly moving legs.  In short, it was a giant centipede, apparently of\nthe scolopendra group, but of a form quite new to me.\n\nThese things I realized in one breathless instant; in the next--Smith\nhad dashed the thing's poisonous life out with one straight, true blow\nof the golf club!\n\nI leaped to the window and threw it widely open, feeling a silk thread\nbrush my hand as I did so.  A black shape was dropping, with incredible\nagility from branch to branch of the ivy, and, without once offering a\nmark for a revolver-shot, it merged into the shadows beneath the trees\nof the garden.  As I turned and switched on the light Nayland Smith\ndropped limply into a chair, leaning his head upon his hands.  Even\nthat grim courage had been tried sorely.\n\n\"Never mind the dacoit, Petrie,\" he said.  \"Nemesis will know where to\nfind him.  We know now what causes the mark of the Zayat Kiss.\nTherefore science is richer for our first brush with the enemy, and the\nenemy is poorer--unless he has any more unclassified centipedes.  I\nunderstand now something that has been puzzling me since I heard of\nit--Sir Crichton's stifled cry.  When we remember that he was almost\npast speech, it is reasonable to suppose that his cry was not 'The red\nhand!' but 'The red ANT!'  Petrie, to think that I failed, by less than\nan hour, to save him from such an end!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n\"THE body of a lascar, dressed in the manner usual on the P. & O.\nboats, was recovered from the Thames off Tilbury by the river police at\nsix A.M. this morning.  It is supposed that the man met with an\naccident in leaving his ship.\"\n\nNayland Smith passed me the evening paper and pointed to the above\nparagraph.\n\n\"For 'lascar' read 'dacoit,'\" he said.  \"Our visitor, who came by way\nof the ivy, fortunately for us, failed to follow his instructions.\nAlso, he lost the centipede and left a clew behind him.  Dr. Fu-Manchu\ndoes not overlook such lapses.\"\n\nIt was a sidelight upon the character of the awful being with whom we\nhad to deal.  My very soul recoiled from bare consideration of the fate\nthat would be ours if ever we fell into his hands.\n\nThe telephone bell rang.  I went out and found that Inspector Weymouth\nof New Scotland Yard had called us up.\n\n\"Will Mr. Nayland Smith please come to the Wapping River Police Station\nat once,\" was the message.\n\nPeaceful interludes were few enough throughout that wild pursuit.\n\n\"It is certainly something important,\" said my friend; \"and, if\nFu-Manchu is at the bottom of it--as we must presume him to\nbe--probably something ghastly.\"\n\nA brief survey of the time-tables showed us that there were no trains\nto serve our haste.  We accordingly chartered a cab and proceeded east.\n\nSmith, throughout the journey, talked entertainingly about his work in\nBurma.  Of intent, I think, he avoided any reference to the\ncircumstances which first had brought him in contact with the sinister\ngenius of the Yellow Movement.  His talk was rather of the sunshine of\nthe East than of its shadows.\n\nBut the drive concluded--and all too soon.  In a silence which neither\nof us seemed disposed to break, we entered the police depot, and\nfollowed an officer who received us into the room where Weymouth waited.\n\nThe inspector greeted us briefly, nodding toward the table.\n\n\"Poor Cadby, the most promising lad at the Yard,\" he said; and his\nusually gruff voice had softened strangely.\n\nSmith struck his right fist into the palm of his left hand and swore\nunder his breath, striding up and down the neat little room.  No one\nspoke for a moment, and in the silence I could hear the whispering of\nthe Thames outside--of the Thames which had so many strange secrets to\ntell, and now was burdened with another.\n\nThe body lay prone upon the deal table--this latest of the river's\ndead--dressed in rough sailor garb, and, to all outward seeming, a\nseaman of nondescript nationality--such as is no stranger in Wapping\nand Shadwell.  His dark, curly hair clung clammily about the brown\nforehead; his skin was stained, they told me.  He wore a gold ring in\none ear, and three fingers of the left hand were missing.\n\n\"It was almost the same with Mason.\"  The river police inspector was\nspeaking.  \"A week ago, on a Wednesday, he went off in his own time on\nsome funny business down St. George's way--and Thursday night the\nten-o'clock boat got the grapnel on him off Hanover Hole.  His first\ntwo fingers on the right hand were clean gone, and his left hand was\nmutilated frightfully.\"\n\nHe paused and glanced at Smith.\n\n\"That lascar, too,\" he continued, \"that you came down to see, sir; you\nremember his hands?\"\n\nSmith nodded.\n\n\"He was not a lascar,\" he said shortly.  \"He was a dacoit.\"\n\nSilence fell again.\n\nI turned to the array of objects lying on the table--those which had\nbeen found in Cadby's clothing.  None of them were noteworthy, except\nthat which had been found thrust into the loose neck of his shirt.\nThis last it was which had led the police to send for Nayland Smith,\nfor it constituted the first clew which had come to light pointing to\nthe authors of these mysterious tragedies.\n\nIt was a Chinese pigtail.  That alone was sufficiently remarkable; but\nit was rendered more so by the fact that the plaited queue was a false\none being attached to a most ingenious bald wig.\n\n\"You're sure it wasn't part of a Chinese make-up?\" questioned Weymouth,\nhis eye on the strange relic.  \"Cadby was clever at disguise.\"\n\nSmith snatched the wig from my hands with a certain irritation, and\ntried to fit it on the dead detective.\n\n\"Too small by inches!\" he jerked.  \"And look how it's padded in the\ncrown.  This thing was made for a most abnormal head.\"\n\nHe threw it down, and fell to pacing the room again.\n\n\"Where did you find him--exactly?\" he asked.\n\n\"Limehouse Reach--under Commercial Dock Pier--exactly an hour ago.\"\n\n\"And you last saw him at eight o'clock last night?\"--to Weymouth.\n\n\"Eight to a quarter past.\"\n\n\"You think he has been dead nearly twenty-four hours, Petrie?\"\n\n\"Roughly, twenty-four hours,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then, we know that he was on the track of the Fu-Manchu group, that he\nfollowed up some clew which led him to the neighborhood of old Ratcliff\nHighway, and that he died the same night.  You are sure that is where\nhe was going?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Weymouth; \"He was jealous of giving anything away, poor\nchap; it meant a big lift for him if he pulled the case off.  But he\ngave me to understand that he expected to spend last night in that\ndistrict.  He left the Yard about eight, as I've said, to go to his\nrooms, and dress for the job.\"\n\n\"Did he keep any record of his cases?\"\n\n\"Of course!  He was most particular.  Cadby was a man with ambitions,\nsir!  You'll want to see his book.  Wait while I get his address; it's\nsomewhere in Brixton.\"\n\nHe went to the telephone, and Inspector Ryman covered up the dead man's\nface.\n\nNayland Smith was palpably excited.\n\n\"He almost succeeded where we have failed, Petrie,\" he said.  \"There is\nno doubt in my mind that he was hot on the track of Fu-Manchu!  Poor\nMason had probably blundered on the scent, too, and he met with a\nsimilar fate.  Without other evidence, the fact that they both died in\nthe same way as the dacoit would be conclusive, for we know that\nFu-Manchu killed the dacoit!\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of the mutilated hands, Smith?\"\n\n\"God knows!  Cadby's death was from drowning, you say?\"\n\n\"There are no other marks of violence.\"\n\n\"But he was a very strong swimmer, Doctor,\" interrupted Inspector\nRyman.  \"Why, he pulled off the quarter-mile championship at the\nCrystal Palace last year!  Cadby wasn't a man easy to drown.  And as\nfor Mason, he was an R.N.R., and like a fish in the water!\"\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders helplessly.\n\n\"Let us hope that one day we shall know how they died,\" he said simply.\n\nWeymouth returned from the telephone.\n\n\"The address is No.--Cold Harbor Lane,\" he reported.  \"I shall not be\nable to come along, but you can't miss it; it's close by the Brixton\nPolice Station.  There's no family, fortunately; he was quite alone in\nthe world.  His case-book isn't in the American desk, which you'll find\nin his sitting-room; it's in the cupboard in the corner--top shelf.\nHere are his keys, all intact.  I think this is the cupboard key.\"\n\nSmith nodded.\n\n\"Come on, Petrie,\" he said.  \"We haven't a second to waste.\"\n\nOur cab was waiting, and in a few seconds we were speeding along\nWapping High Street.  We had gone no more than a few hundred yards, I\nthink, when Smith suddenly slapped his open hand down on his knee.\n\n\"That pigtail!\" he cried.  \"I have left it behind!  We must have it,\nPetrie!  Stop!  Stop!\"\n\nThe cab was pulled up, and Smith alighted.\n\n\"Don't wait for me,\" he directed hurriedly.  \"Here, take Weymouth's\ncard.  Remember where he said the book was?  It's all we want.  Come\nstraight on to Scotland Yard and meet me there.\"\n\n\"But Smith,\" I protested, \"a few minutes can make no difference!\"\n\n\"Can't it!\" he snapped.  \"Do you suppose Fu-Manchu is going to leave\nevidence like that lying about?  It's a thousand to one he has it\nalready, but there is just a bare chance.\"\n\nIt was a new aspect of the situation and one that afforded no room for\ncomment; and so lost in thought did I become that the cab was outside\nthe house for which I was bound ere I realized that we had quitted the\npurlieus of Wapping.  Yet I had had leisure to review the whole troop\nof events which had crowded my life since the return of Nayland Smith\nfrom Burma.  Mentally, I had looked again upon the dead Sir Crichton\nDavey, and with Smith had waited in the dark for the dreadful thing\nthat had killed him.  Now, with those remorseless memories jostling in\nmy mind, I was entering the house of Fu-Manchu's last victim, and the\nshadow of that giant evil seemed to be upon it like a palpable cloud.\n\nCadby's old landlady greeted me with a queer mixture of fear and\nembarrassment in her manner.\n\n\"I am Dr. Petrie,\" I said, \"and I regret that I bring bad news\nrespecting Mr. Cadby.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" she cried.  \"Don't tell me that anything has happened to\nhim!\" And divining something of the mission on which I was come, for\nsuch sad duty often falls to the lot of the medical man: \"Oh, the poor,\nbrave lad!\"\n\nIndeed, I respected the dead man's memory more than ever from that\nhour, since the sorrow of the worthy old soul was quite pathetic, and\nspoke eloquently for the unhappy cause of it.\n\n\"There was a terrible wailing at the back of the house last night,\nDoctor, and I heard it again to-night, a second before you knocked.\nPoor lad!  It was the same when his mother died.\"\n\nAt the moment I paid little attention to her words, for such beliefs\nare common, unfortunately; but when she was sufficiently composed I\nwent on to explain what I thought necessary.  And now the old lady's\nembarrassment took precedence of her sorrow, and presently the truth\ncame out:\n\n\"There's a--young lady--in his rooms, sir.\"\n\nI started.  This might mean little or might mean much.\n\n\"She came and waited for him last night, Doctor--from ten until\nhalf-past--and this morning again.  She came the third time about an\nhour ago, and has been upstairs since.\"\n\n\"Do you know her, Mrs. Dolan?\"\n\nMrs. Dolan grew embarrassed again.\n\n\"Well, Doctor,\" she said, wiping her eyes the while, \"I DO.  And God\nknows he was a good lad, and I like a mother to him; but she is not the\ngirl I should have liked a son of mine to take up with.\"\n\nAt any other time, this would have been amusing; now, it might be\nserious.  Mrs. Dolan's account of the wailing became suddenly\nsignificant, for perhaps it meant that one of Fu-Manchu's dacoit\nfollowers was watching the house, to give warning of any stranger's\napproach!  Warning to whom?  It was unlikely that I should forget the\ndark eyes of another of Fu-Manchu's servants.  Was that lure of men\neven now in the house, completing her evil work?\n\n\"I should never have allowed her in his rooms--\" began Mrs. Dolan\nagain.  Then there was an interruption.\n\nA soft rustling reached my ears--intimately feminine.  The girl was\nstealing down!\n\nI leaped out into the hall, and she turned and fled blindly before\nme--back up the stairs!  Taking three steps at a time, I followed her,\nbounded into the room above almost at her heels, and stood with my back\nto the door.\n\nShe cowered against the desk by the window, a slim figure in a clinging\nsilk gown, which alone explained Mrs. Dolan's distrust.  The gaslight\nwas turned very low, and her hat shadowed her face, but could not hide\nits startling beauty, could not mar the brilliancy of the skin, nor dim\nthe wonderful eyes of this modern Delilah.  For it was she!\n\n\"So I came in time,\" I said grimly, and turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"Oh!\" she panted at that, and stood facing me, leaning back with her\njewel-laden hands clutching the desk edge.\n\n\"Give me whatever you have removed from here,\" I said sternly, \"and\nthen prepare to accompany me.\"\n\nShe took a step forward, her eyes wide with fear, her lips parted.\n\n\"I have taken nothing,\" she said.  Her breast was heaving tumultuously.\n\"Oh, let me go!  Please, let me go!\"  And impulsively she threw herself\nforward, pressing clasped hands against my shoulder and looking up into\nmy face with passionate, pleading eyes.\n\nIt is with some shame that I confess how her charm enveloped me like a\nmagic cloud.  Unfamiliar with the complex Oriental temperament, I had\nlaughed at Nayland Smith when he had spoken of this girl's infatuation.\n\"Love in the East,\" he had said, \"is like the conjurer's mango-tree; it\nis born, grows and flowers at the touch of a hand.\" Now, in those\npleading eyes I read confirmation of his words.  Her clothes or her\nhair exhaled a faint perfume.  Like all Fu-Manchu's servants, she was\nperfectly chosen for her peculiar duties.  Her beauty was wholly\nintoxicating.\n\nBut I thrust her away.\n\n\"You have no claim to mercy,\" I said.  \"Do not count upon any.  What\nhave you taken from here?\"\n\nShe grasped the lapels of my coat.\n\n\"I will tell you all I can--all I dare,\" she panted eagerly, fearfully.\n\"I should know how to deal with your friend, but with you I am lost!\nIf you could only understand you would not be so cruel.\"  Her slight\naccent added charm to the musical voice.  \"I am not free, as your\nEnglish women are.  What I do I must do, for it is the will of my\nmaster, and I am only a slave.  Ah, you are not a man if you can give\nme to the police.  You have no heart if you can forget that I tried to\nsave you once.\"\n\nI had feared that plea, for, in her own Oriental fashion, she certainly\nhad tried to save me from a deadly peril once--at the expense of my\nfriend.  But I had feared the plea, for I did not know how to meet it.\nHow could I give her up, perhaps to stand her trial for murder?  And\nnow I fell silent, and she saw why I was silent.\n\n\"I may deserve no mercy; I may be even as bad as you think; but what\nhave YOU to do with the police?  It is not your work to hound a woman\nto death.  Could you ever look another woman in the eyes--one that you\nloved, and know that she trusted you--if you had done such a thing?\nAh, I have no friend in all the world, or I should not be here.  Do not\nbe my enemy, my judge, and make me worse than I am; be my friend, and\nsave me--from HIM.\" The tremulous lips were close to mine, her breath\nfanned my cheek.  \"Have mercy on me.\"\n\nAt that moment I honestly would have given half of my worldly\npossessions to have been spared the decision which I knew I must come\nto.  After all, what proof had I that she was a willing accomplice of\nDr. Fu-Manchu?  Furthermore, she was an Oriental, and her code must\nnecessarily be different from mine.  Irreconcilable as the thing may be\nwith Western ideas, Nayland Smith had really told me that he believed\nthe girl to be a slave.  Then there remained that other reason why I\nloathed the idea of becoming her captor.  It was almost tantamount to\nbetrayal!  Must I soil my hands with such work?\n\nThus--I suppose--her seductive beauty argued against my sense of right.\nThe jeweled fingers grasped my shoulders nervously, and her slim body\nquivered against mine as she watched me, with all her soul in her eyes,\nin an abandonment of pleading despair.  Then I remembered the fate of\nthe man in whose room we stood.\n\n\"You lured Cadby to his death,\" I said, and shook her off.\n\n\"No, no!\" she cried wildly, clutching at me.  \"No, I swear by the holy\nname I did not!  I did not!  I watched him, spied upon him--yes!  But,\nlisten: it was because he would not be warned that he met his death.  I\ncould not save him!  Ah, I am not so bad as that.  I will tell you.  I\nhave taken his notebook and torn out the last pages and burnt them.\nLook!  in the grate.  The book was too big to steal away.  I came twice\nand could not find it.  There, will you let me go?\"\n\n\"If you will tell me where and how to seize Dr. Fu-Manchu--yes.\"\n\nHer hands dropped and she took a backward step.  A new terror was to be\nread in her face.\n\n\"I dare not!  I dare not!\"\n\n\"Then you would--if you dared?\"\n\nShe was watching me intently.\n\n\"Not if YOU would go to find him,\" she said.\n\nAnd, with all that I thought her to be, the stern servant of justice\nthat I would have had myself, I felt the hot blood leap to my cheek at\nall which the words implied.  She grasped my arm.\n\n\"Could you hide me from him if I came to you, and told you all I know?\"\n\n\"The authorities--\"\n\n\"Ah!\"  Her expression changed.  \"They can put me on the rack if they\nchoose, but never one word would I speak--never one little word.\"\n\nShe threw up her head scornfully.  Then the proud glance softened again.\n\n\"But I will speak for you.\"\n\nCloser she came, and closer, until she could whisper in my ear.\n\n\"Hide me from your police, from HIM, from everybody, and I will no\nlonger be his slave.\"\n\nMy heart was beating with painful rapidity.  I had not counted on this\nwarring with a woman; moreover, it was harder than I could have dreamt\nof.  For some time I had been aware that by the charm of her\npersonality and the art of her pleading she had brought me down from my\njudgment seat--had made it all but impossible for me to give her up to\njustice.  Now, I was disarmed--but in a quandary.  What should I do?\nWhat COULD I do?  I turned away from her and walked to the hearth, in\nwhich some paper ash lay and yet emitted a faint smell.\n\nNot more than ten seconds elapsed, I am confident, from the time that I\nstepped across the room until I glanced back.  But she had gone!\n\nAs I leapt to the door the key turned gently from the outside.\n\n\"Ma 'alesh!\" came her soft whisper; \"but I am afraid to trust you--yet.\nBe comforted, for there is one near who would have killed you had I\nwished it.  Remember, I will come to you whenever you will take me and\nhide me.\"\n\nLight footsteps pattered down the stairs.  I heard a stifled cry from\nMrs. Dolan as the mysterious visitor ran past her.  The front door\nopened and closed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\n\"Shen-Yan's is a dope-shop in one of the burrows off the old Ratcliff\nHighway,\" said Inspector Weymouth.\n\n\"'Singapore Charlie's,' they call it.  It's a center for some of the\nChinese societies, I believe, but all sorts of opium-smokers use it.\nThere have never been any complaints that I know of.  I don't\nunderstand this.\"\n\nWe stood in his room at New Scotland Yard, bending over a sheet of\nfoolscap upon which were arranged some burned fragments from poor\nCadby's grate, for so hurriedly had the girl done her work that\ncombustion had not been complete.\n\n\"What do we make of this?\" said Smith.  \"'. . . Hunchback . . . lascar\nwent up . . . unlike others . . . not return . . . till Shen-Yan'\n(there is no doubt about the name, I think) 'turned me out . . . booming\nsound . . . lascar in . . . mortuary I could ident . . . not for days,\nor suspici . . . Tuesday night in a different make . . . snatch\n. . . pigtail . . .'\"\n\n\"The pigtail again!\" rapped Weymouth.\n\n\"She evidently burned the torn-out pages all together,\" continued\nSmith.  \"They lay flat, and this was in the middle.  I see the hand of\nretributive justice in that, Inspector.  Now we have a reference to a\nhunchback, and what follows amounts to this: A lascar (amongst several\nother persons) went up somewhere--presumably upstairs--at Shen-Yan's,\nand did not come down again.  Cadby, who was there disguised, noted a\nbooming sound.  Later, he identified the lascar in some mortuary.  We\nhave no means of fixing the date of this visit to Shen-Yan's, but I\nfeel inclined to put down the 'lascar' as the dacoit who was murdered\nby Fu-Manchu!  It is sheer supposition, however.  But that Cadby meant\nto pay another visit to the place in a different 'make-up' or disguise,\nis evident, and that the Tuesday night proposed was last night is a\nreasonable deduction.  The reference to a pigtail is principally\ninteresting because of what was found on Cadby's body.\"\n\nInspector Weymouth nodded affirmatively, and Smith glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Exactly ten-twenty-three,\" he said.  \"I will trouble you, Inspector,\nfor the freedom of your fancy wardrobe.  There is time to spend an hour\nin the company of Shen-Yan's opium friends.\"\n\nWeymouth raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"It might be risky.  What about an official visit?\"\n\nNayland Smith laughed.\n\n\"Worse than useless!  By your own showing, the place is open to\ninspection.  No; guile against guile!  We are dealing with a Chinaman,\nwith the incarnate essence of Eastern subtlety, with the most\nstupendous genius that the modern Orient has produced.\"\n\n\"I don't believe in disguises,\" said Weymouth, with a certain\ntruculence.  \"It's mostly played out, that game, and generally leads to\nfailure.  Still, if you're determined, sir, there's an end of it.\nFoster will make your face up.  What disguise do you propose to adopt?\"\n\n\"A sort of Dago seaman, I think; something like poor Cadby.  I can rely\non my knowledge of the brutes, if I am sure of my disguise.\"\n\n\"You are forgetting me, Smith,\" I said.\n\nHe turned to me quickly.\n\n\"Petrie,\" he replied, \"it is MY business, unfortunately, but it is no\nsort of hobby.\"\n\n\"You mean that you can no longer rely upon me?\" I said angrily.\n\nSmith grasped my hand, and met my rather frigid stare with a look of\nreal concern on his gaunt, bronzed face.\n\n\"My dear old chap,\" he answered, \"that was really unkind.  You know\nthat I meant something totally different.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Smith;\" I said, immediately ashamed of my choler, and\nwrung his hand heartily.  \"I can pretend to smoke opium as well as\nanother.  I shall be going, too, Inspector.\"\n\nAs a result of this little passage of words, some twenty minutes later\ntwo dangerous-looking seafaring ruffians entered a waiting cab,\naccompanied by Inspector Weymouth, and were driven off into the\nwilderness of London's night.  In this theatrical business there was,\nto my mind, something ridiculous--almost childish--and I could have\nlaughed heartily had it not been that grim tragedy lurked so near to\nfarce.\n\nThe mere recollection that somewhere at our journey's end Fu-Manchu\nawaited us was sufficient to sober my reflections--Fu-Manchu, who, with\nall the powers represented by Nayland Smith pitted against him, pursued\nhis dark schemes triumphantly, and lurked in hiding within this very\narea which was so sedulously patrolled--Fu-Manchu, whom I had never\nseen, but whose name stood for horrors indefinable!  Perhaps I was\ndestined to meet the terrible Chinese doctor to-night.\n\nI ceased to pursue a train of thought which promised to lead to morbid\ndepths, and directed my attention to what Smith was saying.\n\n\"We will drop down from Wapping and reconnoiter, as you say the place\nis close to the riverside.  Then you can put us ashore somewhere below.\nRyman can keep the launch close to the back of the premises, and your\nfellows will be hanging about near the front, near enough to hear the\nwhistle.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented Weymouth; \"I've arranged for that.  If you are\nsuspected, you shall give the alarm?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Smith thoughtfully.  \"Even in that event I might\nwait awhile.\"\n\n\"Don't wait too long,\" advised the Inspector.  \"We shouldn't be much\nwiser if your next appearance was on the end of a grapnel, somewhere\ndown Greenwich Reach, with half your fingers missing.\"\n\nThe cab pulled up outside the river police depot, and Smith and I\nentered without delay, four shabby-looking fellows who had been seated\nin the office springing up to salute the Inspector, who followed us in.\n\n\"Guthrie and Lisle,\" he said briskly, \"get along and find a dark corner\nwhich commands the door of Singapore Charlie's off the old Highway.\nYou look the dirtiest of the troupe, Guthrie; you might drop asleep on\nthe pavement, and Lisle can argue with you about getting home.  Don't\nmove till you hear the whistle inside or have my orders, and note\neverybody that goes in and comes out.  You other two belong to this\ndivision?\"\n\nThe C.I.D. men having departed, the remaining pair saluted again.\n\n\"Well, you're on special duty to-night. You've been prompt, but don't\nstick your chests out so much.  Do you know of a back way to\nShen-Yan's?\"\n\nThe men looked at one another, and both shook their heads.\n\n\"There's an empty shop nearly opposite, sir,\" replied one of them.  \"I\nknow a broken window at the back where we could climb in.  Then we\ncould get through to the front and watch from there.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried the Inspector.  \"See you are not spotted, though; and if\nyou hear the whistle, don't mind doing a bit of damage, but be inside\nShen-Yan's like lightning.  Otherwise, wait for orders.\"\n\nInspector Ryman came in, glancing at the clock.\n\n\"Launch is waiting,\" he said.\n\n\"Right,\" replied Smith thoughtfully.  \"I am half afraid, though, that\nthe recent alarms may have scared our quarry--your man, Mason, and then\nCadby.  Against which we have that, so far as he is likely to know,\nthere has been no clew pointing to this opium den.  Remember, he thinks\nCadby's notes are destroyed.\"\n\n\"The whole business is an utter mystery to me,\" confessed Ryman.  \"I'm\ntold that there's some dangerous Chinese devil hiding somewhere in\nLondon, and that you expect to find him at Shen-Yan's. Supposing he\nuses that place, which is possible, how do you know he's there\nto-night?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Smith; \"but it is the first clew we have had pointing\nto one of his haunts, and time means precious lives where Dr. Fu-Manchu\nis concerned.\"\n\n\"Who is he, sir, exactly, this Dr. Fu-Manchu?\"\n\n\"I have only the vaguest idea, Inspector; but he is no ordinary\ncriminal.  He is the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put\non earth for centuries.  He has the backing of a political group whose\nwealth is enormous, and his mission in Europe is to PAVE THE WAY!  Do\nyou follow me?  He is the advance-agent of a movement so epoch-making\nthat not one Britisher, and not one American, in fifty thousand has\never dreamed of it.\"\n\nRyman stared, but made no reply, and we went out, passing down to the\nbreakwater and boarding the waiting launch.  With her crew of three,\nthe party numbered seven that swung out into the Pool, and, clearing\nthe pier, drew in again and hugged the murky shore.\n\nThe night had been clear enough hitherto, but now came scudding\nrainbanks to curtain the crescent moon, and anon to unveil her again\nand show the muddy swirls about us.  The view was not extensive from\nthe launch.  Sometimes a deepening of the near shadows would tell of a\nmoored barge, or lights high above our heads mark the deck of a large\nvessel.  In the floods of moonlight gaunt shapes towered above; in the\nensuing darkness only the oily glitter of the tide occupied the\nforeground of the night-piece.\n\nThe Surrey shore was a broken wall of blackness, patched with lights\nabout which moved hazy suggestions of human activity.  The bank we were\nfollowing offered a prospect even more gloomy--a dense, dark mass, amid\nwhich, sometimes, mysterious half-tones told of a dock gate, or sudden\nhigh lights leapt flaring to the eye.\n\nThen, out of the mystery ahead, a green light grew and crept down upon\nus.  A giant shape loomed up, and frowned crushingly upon the little\ncraft.  A blaze of light, the jangle of a bell, and it was past.  We\nwere dancing in the wash of one of the Scotch steamers, and the murk\nhad fallen again.\n\nDiscords of remote activity rose above the more intimate throbbing of\nour screw, and we seemed a pigmy company floating past the workshops of\nBrobdingnagian toilers.  The chill of the near water communicated\nitself to me, and I felt the protection of my shabby garments\ninadequate against it.\n\nFar over on the Surrey shore a blue light--vaporous,\nmysterious--flicked translucent tongues against the night's curtain.\nIt was a weird, elusive flame, leaping, wavering, magically changing\nfrom blue to a yellowed violet, rising, falling.\n\n\"Only a gasworks,\" came Smith's voice, and I knew that he, too, had\nbeen watching those elfin fires.  \"But it always reminds me of a\nMexican teocalli, and the altar of sacrifice.\"\n\nThe simile was apt, but gruesome.  I thought of Dr. Fu-Manchu and the\nsevered fingers, and could not repress a shudder.\n\n\"On your left, past the wooden pier!  Not where the lamp is--beyond\nthat; next to the dark, square building--Shen-Yan's.\"\n\nIt was Inspector Ryman speaking.\n\n\"Drop us somewhere handy, then,\" replied Smith, \"and lie close in, with\nyour ears wide open.  We may have to run for it, so don't go far away.\"\n\nFrom the tone of his voice I knew that the night mystery of the Thames\nhad claimed at least one other victim.\n\n\"Dead slow,\" came Ryman's order.  \"We'll put in to the Stone Stairs.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nA SEEMINGLY drunken voice was droning from a neighboring alleyway as\nSmith lurched in hulking fashion to the door of a little shop above\nwhich, crudely painted, were the words:\n\n\n\"SHEN-YAN, Barber.\"\n\n\nI shuffled along behind him, and had time to note the box of studs,\nGerman shaving tackle and rolls of twist which lay untidily in the\nwindow ere Smith kicked the door open, clattered down three wooden\nsteps, and pulled himself up with a jerk, seizing my arm for support.\n\nWe stood in a bare and very dirty room, which could only claim kinship\nwith a civilized shaving-saloon by virtue of the grimy towel thrown\nacross the back of the solitary chair.  A Yiddish theatrical bill of\nsome kind, illustrated, adorned one of the walls, and another bill, in\nwhat may have been Chinese, completed the decorations.  From behind a\ncurtain heavily brocaded with filth a little Chinaman appeared, dressed\nin a loose smock, black trousers and thick-soled slippers, and,\nadvancing, shook his head vigorously.\n\n\"No shavee--no shavee,\" he chattered, simian fashion, squinting from\none to the other of us with his twinkling eyes.  \"Too late!  Shuttee\nshop!\"\n\n\"Don't you come none of it wi' me!\" roared Smith, in a voice of amazing\ngruffness, and shook an artificially dirtied fist under the Chinaman's\nnose.  \"Get inside and gimme an' my mate a couple o' pipes.  Smokee\npipe, you yellow scum--savvy?\"\n\nMy friend bent forward and glared into the other's eyes with a\nvindictiveness that amazed me, unfamiliar as I was with this form of\ngentle persuasion.\n\n\"Kop 'old o' that,\" he said, and thrust a coin into the Chinaman's\nyellow paw.  \"Keep me waitin' an' I'll pull the dam' shop down,\nCharlie.  You can lay to it.\"\n\n\"No hab got pipee--\" began the other.\n\nSmith raised his fist, and Yan capitulated.\n\n\"Allee lightee,\" he said.  \"Full up--no loom.  You come see.\"\n\nHe dived behind the dirty curtain, Smith and I following, and ran up a\ndark stair.  The next moment I found myself in an atmosphere which was\nliterally poisonous.  It was all but unbreathable, being loaded with\nopium fumes.  Never before had I experienced anything like it.  Every\nbreath was an effort.  A tin oil-lamp on a box in the middle of the\nfloor dimly illuminated the horrible place, about the walls of which\nten or twelve bunks were ranged and all of them occupied.  Most of the\noccupants were lying motionless, but one or two were squatting in their\nbunks noisily sucking at the little metal pipes.  These had not yet\nattained to the opium-smoker's Nirvana.\n\n\"No loom--samee tella you,\" said Shen-Yan, complacently testing Smith's\nshilling with his yellow, decayed teeth.\n\nSmith walked to a corner and dropped cross-legged, on the floor,\npulling me down with him.\n\n\"Two pipe quick,\" he said.  \"Plenty room.  Two piecee pipe--or plenty\nheap trouble.\"\n\nA dreary voice from one of the bunks came:\n\n\"Give 'im a pipe, Charlie, curse yer!  an' stop 'is palaver.\"\n\nYan performed a curious little shrug, rather of the back than of the\nshoulders, and shuffled to the box which bore the smoky lamp.  Holding\na needle in the flame, he dipped it, when red-hot, into an old cocoa\ntin, and withdrew it with a bead of opium adhering to the end.  Slowly\nroasting this over the lamp, he dropped it into the bowl of the metal\npipe which he held ready, where it burned with a spirituous blue flame.\n\n\"Pass it over,\" said Smith huskily, and rose on his knees with the\nassumed eagerness of a slave to the drug.\n\nYan handed him the pipe, which he promptly put to his lips, and\nprepared another for me.\n\n\"Whatever you do, don't inhale any,\" came Smith's whispered injunction.\n\nIt was with a sense of nausea greater even than that occasioned by the\ndisgusting atmosphere of the den that I took the pipe and pretended to\nsmoke.  Taking my cue from my friend, I allowed my head gradually to\nsink lower and lower, until, within a few minutes, I sprawled sideways\non the floor, Smith lying close beside me.\n\n\"The ship's sinkin',\" droned a voice from one of the bunks.  \"Look at\nthe rats.\"\n\nYan had noiselessly withdrawn, and I experienced a curious sense of\nisolation from my fellows--from the whole of the Western world.  My\nthroat was parched with the fumes, my head ached.  The vicious\natmosphere seemed contaminating.  I was as one dropped--\n\nSomewhere East of Suez, where the best is like the worst, And there\nain't no Ten Commandments and a man can raise a thirst.\n\nSmith began to whisper softly.\n\n\"We have carried it through successfully so far,\" he said.  \"I don't\nknow if you have observed it, but there is a stair just behind you,\nhalf concealed by a ragged curtain.  We are near that, and well in the\ndark.  I have seen nothing suspicious so far--or nothing much.  But if\nthere was anything going forward it would no doubt be delayed until we\nnew arrivals were well doped.  S-SH!\"\n\nHe pressed my arm to emphasize the warning.  Through my half-closed\neyes I perceived a shadowy form near the curtain to which he had\nreferred.  I lay like a log, but my muscles were tensed nervously.\n\nThe shadow materialized as the figure moved forward into the room with\na curiously lithe movement.\n\nThe smoky lamp in the middle of the place afforded scant illumination,\nserving only to indicate sprawling shapes--here an extended hand, brown\nor yellow, there a sketchy, corpse-like face; whilst from all about\nrose obscene sighings and murmurings in far-away voices--an uncanny,\nanimal chorus.  It was like a glimpse of the Inferno seen by some\nChinese Dante.  But so close to us stood the newcomer that I was able\nto make out a ghastly parchment face, with small, oblique eyes, and a\nmisshapen head crowned with a coiled pigtail, surmounting a slight,\nhunched body.  There was something unnatural, inhuman, about that\nmasklike face, and something repulsive in the bent shape and the long,\nyellow hands clasped one upon the other.\n\nFu-Manchu, from Smith's account, in no way resembled this crouching\napparition with the death's-head countenance and lithe movements; but\nan instinct of some kind told me that we were on the right scent--that\nthis was one of the doctor's servants.  How I came to that conclusion,\nI cannot explain; but with no doubt in my mind that this was a member\nof the formidable murder group, I saw the yellow man creep nearer,\nnearer, silently, bent and peering.\n\nHe was watching us.\n\nOf another circumstance I became aware, and a disquieting circumstance.\nThere were fewer murmurings and sighings from the surrounding bunks.\nThe presence of the crouching figure had created a sudden semi-silence\nin the den, which could only mean that some of the supposed\nopium-smokers had merely feigned coma and the approach of coma.\n\nNayland Smith lay like a dead man, and trusting to the darkness, I,\ntoo, lay prone and still, but watched the evil face bending lower and\nlower, until it came within a few inches of my own.  I completely\nclosed my eyes.\n\nDelicate fingers touched my right eyelid.  Divining what was coming, I\nrolled my eyes up, as the lid was adroitly lifted and lowered again.\nThe man moved away.\n\nI had saved the situation!  And noting anew the hush about me--a hush\nin which I fancied many pairs of ears listened--I was glad.  For just a\nmoment I realized fully how, with the place watched back and front, we\nyet were cut off, were in the hands of Far Easterns, to some extent in\nthe power of members of that most inscrutably mysterious race, the\nChinese.\n\n\"Good,\" whispered Smith at my side.  \"I don't think I could have done\nit.  He took me on trust after that.  My God!  what an awful face.\nPetrie, it's the hunchback of Cadby's notes.  Ah, I thought so.  Do you\nsee that?\"\n\nI turned my eyes round as far as was possible.  A man had scrambled\ndown from one of the bunks and was following the bent figure across the\nroom.\n\nThey passed around us quietly, the little yellow man leading, with his\ncurious, lithe gait, and the other, an impassive Chinaman, following.\nThe curtain was raised, and I heard footsteps receding on the stairs.\n\n\"Don't stir,\" whispered Smith.\n\nAn intense excitement was clearly upon him, and he communicated it to\nme.  Who was the occupant of the room above?\n\nFootsteps on the stair, and the Chinaman reappeared, recrossed the\nfloor, and went out.  The little, bent man went over to another bunk,\nthis time leading up the stair one who looked like a lascar.\n\n\"Did you see his right hand?\" whispered Smith.  \"A dacoit!  They come\nhere to report and to take orders.  Petrie, Dr. Fu-Manchu is up there.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\"--softly.\n\n\"Wait.  Then we must try to rush the stairs.  It would be futile to\nbring in the police first.  He is sure to have some other exit.  I will\ngive the word while the little yellow devil is down here.  You are\nnearer and will have to go first, but if the hunchback follows, I can\nthen deal with him.\"\n\nOur whispered colloquy was interrupted by the return of the dacoit, who\nrecrossed the room as the Chinaman had done, and immediately took his\ndeparture.  A third man, whom Smith identified as a Malay, ascended the\nmysterious stairs, descended, and went out; and a fourth, whose\nnationality it was impossible to determine, followed.  Then, as the\nsoftly moving usher crossed to a bunk on the right of the outer door--\n\n\"Up you go, Petrie,\" cried Smith, for further delay was dangerous and\nfurther dissimulation useless.\n\nI leaped to my feet.  Snatching my revolver from the pocket of the\nrough jacket I wore, I bounded to the stair and went blundering up in\ncomplete darkness.  A chorus of brutish cries clamored from behind,\nwith a muffled scream rising above them all.  But Nayland Smith was\nclose behind as I raced along a covered gangway, in a purer air, and at\nmy heels when I crashed open a door at the end and almost fell into the\nroom beyond.\n\nWhat I saw were merely a dirty table, with some odds and ends upon it\nof which I was too excited to take note, an oil-lamp swung by a brass\nchain above, and a man sitting behind the table.  But from the moment\nthat my gaze rested upon the one who sat there, I think if the place\nhad been an Aladdin's palace I should have had no eyes for any of its\nwonders.\n\nHe wore a plain yellow robe, of a hue almost identical with that of his\nsmooth, hairless countenance.  His hands were large, long and bony, and\nhe held them knuckles upward, and rested his pointed chin upon their\nthinness.  He had a great, high brow, crowned with sparse,\nneutral-colored hair.\n\nOf his face, as it looked out at me over the dirty table, I despair of\nwriting convincingly.  It was that of an archangel of evil, and it was\nwholly dominated by the most uncanny eyes that ever reflected a human\nsoul, for they were narrow and long, very slightly oblique, and of a\nbrilliant green.  But their unique horror lay in a certain filminess\n(it made me think of the membrana nictitans in a bird) which, obscuring\nthem as I threw wide the door, seemed to lift as I actually passed the\nthreshold, revealing the eyes in all their brilliant iridescence.\n\nI know that I stopped dead, one foot within the room, for the malignant\nforce of the man was something surpassing my experience.  He was\nsurprised by this sudden intrusion--yes, but no trace of fear showed\nupon that wonderful face, only a sort of pitying contempt.  And, as I\npaused, he rose slowly to his feet, never removing his gaze from mine.\n\n\"IT'S FU-MANCHU!\" cried Smith over my shoulder, in a voice that was\nalmost a scream.  \"IT'S FU-MANCHU!  Cover him!  Shoot him dead if--\"\n\nThe conclusion of that sentence I never heard.\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu reached down beside the table, and the floor slipped from\nunder me.\n\nOne last glimpse I had of the fixed green eyes, and with a scream I was\nunable to repress I dropped, dropped, dropped, and plunged into icy\nwater, which closed over my head.\n\nVaguely I had seen a spurt of flame, had heard another cry following my\nown, a booming sound (the trap), the flat note of a police whistle.\nBut when I rose to the surface impenetrable darkness enveloped me; I\nwas spitting filthy, oily liquid from my mouth, and fighting down the\nblack terror that had me by the throat--terror of the darkness about\nme, of the unknown depths beneath me, of the pit into which I was cast\namid stifling stenches and the lapping of tidal water.\n\n\"Smith!\" I cried. . . . \"Help!  Help!\"\n\nMy voice seemed to beat back upon me, yet I was about to cry out again,\nwhen, mustering all my presence of mind and all my failing courage, I\nrecognized that I had better employment of my energies, and began to\nswim straight ahead, desperately determined to face all the horrors of\nthis place--to die hard if die I must.\n\nA drop of liquid fire fell through the darkness and hissed into the\nwater beside me!\n\nI felt that, despite my resolution, I was going mad.\n\nAnother fiery drop--and another!\n\nI touched a rotting wooden post and slimy timbers.  I had reached one\nbound of my watery prison.  More fire fell from above, and the scream\nof hysteria quivered, unuttered, in my throat.\n\nKeeping myself afloat with increasing difficulty in my heavy garments,\nI threw my head back and raised my eyes.\n\nNo more drops fell, and no more drops would fall; but it was merely a\nquestion of time for the floor to collapse.  For it was beginning to\nemit a dull, red glow.\n\nThe room above me was in flames!\n\nIt was drops of burning oil from the lamp, finding passage through the\ncracks in the crazy flooring, which had fallen about me--for the death\ntrap had reclosed, I suppose, mechanically.\n\nMy saturated garments were dragging me down, and now I could hear the\nflames hungrily eating into the ancient rottenness overhead.  Shortly\nthat cauldron would be loosed upon my head.  The glow of the flames\ngrew brighter . . . and showed me the half-rotten piles upholding the\nbuilding, showed me the tidal mark upon the slime-coated walls--showed\nme that there was no escape!\n\nBy some subterranean duct the foul place was fed from the Thames.  By\nthat duct, with the outgoing tide, my body would pass, in the wake of\nMason, Cadby, and many another victim!\n\nRusty iron rungs were affixed to one of the walls communicating with a\ntrap--but the bottom three were missing!\n\nBrighter and brighter grew the awesome light the light of what should\nbe my funeral pyre--reddening the oily water and adding a new dread to\nthe whispering, clammy horror of the pit.  But something it showed\nme . . . a projecting beam a few feet above the water . . . and directly\nbelow the iron ladder!\n\n\"Merciful Heaven!\" I breathed.  \"Have I the strength?\"\n\nA desire for laughter claimed me with sudden, all but irresistible\nforce.  I knew what it portended and fought it down--grimly, sternly.\n\nMy garments weighed upon me like a suit of mail; with my chest aching\ndully, my veins throbbing to bursting, I forced tired muscles to work,\nand, every stroke an agony, approached the beam.  Nearer I swam\n. . . nearer.  Its shadow fell black upon the water, which now had all\nthe seeming of a pool of blood.  Confused sounds--a remote uproar--came\nto my ears.  I was nearly spent . . . I was in the shadow of the beam!  If\nI could throw up one arm. . .\n\nA shrill scream sounded far above me!\n\n\"Petrie!  Petrie!\"  (That voice must be Smith's!)  \"Don't touch the\nbeam!  For God's sake DON'T TOUCH THE BEAM!  Keep afloat another few\nseconds and I can get to you!\"\n\nAnother few seconds!  Was that possible?\n\nI managed to turn, to raise my throbbing head; and I saw the strangest\nsight which that night yet had offered.\n\nNayland Smith stood upon the lowest iron rung . . . supported by the\nhideous, crook-backed Chinaman, who stood upon the rung above!\n\n\"I can't reach him!\"\n\nIt was as Smith hissed the words despairingly that I looked up--and saw\nthe Chinaman snatch at his coiled pigtail and pull it off!  With it\ncame the wig to which it was attached; and the ghastly yellow mask,\ndeprived of its fastenings, fell from position!  \"Here!  Here!  Be\nquick!  Oh!  be quick!  You can lower this to him!  Be quick!  Be\nquick!\"\n\nA cloud of hair came falling about the slim shoulders as the speaker\nbent to pass this strange lifeline to Smith; and I think it was my\nwonder at knowing her for the girl whom that day I had surprised in\nCadby's rooms which saved my life.\n\nFor I not only kept afloat, but kept my gaze upturned to that\nbeautiful, flushed face, and my eyes fixed upon hers--which were wild\nwith fear . . . for me!\n\nSmith, by some contortion, got the false queue into my grasp, and I,\nwith the strength of desperation, by that means seized hold upon the\nlowest rung.  With my friend's arm round me I realized that exhaustion\nwas even nearer than I had supposed.  My last distinct memory is of the\nbursting of the floor above and the big burning joist hissing into the\npool beneath us.  Its fiery passage, striated with light, disclosed two\nsword blades, riveted, edges up along the top of the beam which I had\nstriven to reach.\n\n\"The severed fingers--\" I said; and swooned.\n\nHow Smith got me through the trap I do not know--nor how we made our\nway through the smoke and flames of the narrow passage it opened upon.\nMy next recollection is of sitting up, with my friend's arm supporting\nme and Inspector Ryman holding a glass to my lips.\n\nA bright glare dazzled my eyes.  A crowd surged about us, and a clangor\nand shouting drew momentarily nearer.\n\n\"It's the engines coming,\" explained Smith, seeing my bewilderment.\n\"Shen-Yan's is in flames.  It was your shot, as you fell through the\ntrap, broke the oil-lamp.\"\n\n\"Is everybody out?\"\n\n\"So far as we know.\"\n\n\"Fu-Manchu?\"\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"No one has seen him.  There was some door at the back--\"\n\n\"Do you think he may--\"\n\n\"No,\" he said tensely.  \"Not until I see him lying dead before me shall\nI believe it.\"\n\nThen memory resumed its sway.  I struggled to my feet.\n\n\"Smith, where is she?\" I cried.  \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered.\n\n\"She's given us the slip, Doctor,\" said Inspector Weymouth, as a\nfire-engine came swinging round the corner of the narrow lane.  \"So has\nMr. Singapore Charlie--and, I'm afraid, somebody else.  We've got six\nor eight all-sorts, some awake and some asleep, but I suppose we shall\nhave to let 'em go again.  Mr. Smith tells me that the girl was\ndisguised as a Chinaman.  I expect that's why she managed to slip away.\"\n\nI recalled how I had been dragged from the pit by the false queue, how\nthe strange discovery which had brought death to poor Cadby had brought\nlife to me, and I seemed to remember, too, that Smith had dropped it as\nhe threw his arm about me on the ladder.  Her mask the girl might have\nretained, but her wig, I felt certain, had been dropped into the water.\n\nIt was later that night, when the brigade still were playing upon the\nblackened shell of what had been Shen-Yan's opium-shop, and Smith and I\nwere speeding away in a cab from the scene of God knows how many\ncrimes, that I had an idea.\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, \"did you bring the pigtail with you that was found on\nCadby?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I had hoped to meet the owner.\"\n\n\"Have you got it now?\"\n\n\"No. I met the owner.\"\n\nI thrust my hands deep into the pockets of the big pea-jacket lent to\nme by Inspector Ryman, leaning back in my corner.\n\n\"We shall never really excel at this business,\" continued Nayland\nSmith.  \"We are far too sentimental.  I knew what it meant to us,\nPetrie, what it meant to the world, but I hadn't the heart.  I owed her\nyour life--I had to square the account.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nNIGHT fell on Redmoat.  I glanced from the window at the nocturne in\nsilver and green which lay beneath me.  To the west of the shrubbery,\nwith its broken canopy of elms and beyond the copper beech which marked\nthe center of its mazes, a gap offered a glimpse of the Waverney where\nit swept into a broad.  Faint bird-calls floated over the water.\nThese, with the whisper of leaves, alone claimed the ear.\n\nIdeal rural peace, and the music of an English summer evening; but to\nmy eyes, every shadow holding fantastic terrors; to my ears, every\nsound a signal of dread.  For the deathful hand of Fu-Manchu was\nstretched over Redmoat, at any hour to loose strange, Oriental horrors\nupon its inmates.\n\n\"Well,\" said Nayland Smith, joining me at the window, \"we had dared to\nhope him dead, but we know now that he lives!\"\n\nThe Rev. J. D. Eltham coughed nervously, and I turned, leaning my elbow\nupon the table, and studied the play of expression upon the refined,\nsensitive face of the clergyman.\n\n\"You think I acted rightly in sending for you, Mr. Smith?\"\n\nNayland Smith smoked furiously.\n\n\"Mr. Eltham,\" he replied, \"you see in me a man groping in the dark.  I\nam to-day no nearer to the conclusion of my mission than upon the day\nwhen I left Mandalay.  You offer me a clew; I am here.  Your affair, I\nbelieve, stands thus: A series of attempted burglaries, or something of\nthe kind, has alarmed your household.  Yesterday, returning from London\nwith your daughter, you were both drugged in some way and, occupying a\ncompartment to yourselves, you both slept.  Your daughter awoke, and\nsaw someone else in the carriage--a yellow-faced man who held a case of\ninstruments in his hands.\"\n\n\"Yes; I was, of course, unable to enter into particulars over the\ntelephone.  The man was standing by one of the windows.  Directly he\nobserved that my daughter was awake, he stepped towards her.\"\n\n\"What did he do with the case in his hands?\"\n\n\"She did not notice--or did not mention having noticed.  In fact, as\nwas natural, she was so frightened that she recalls nothing more,\nbeyond the fact that she strove to arouse me, without succeeding, felt\nhands grasp her shoulders--and swooned.\"\n\n\"But someone used the emergency cord, and stopped the train.\"\n\n\"Greba has no recollection of having done so.\"\n\n\"Hm!  Of course, no yellow-faced man was on the train.  When did you\nawake?\"\n\n\"I was aroused by the guard, but only when he had repeatedly shaken me.\"\n\n\"Upon reaching Great Yarmouth you immediately called up Scotland Yard?\nYou acted very wisely, sir.  How long were you in China?\"\n\nMr. Eltham's start of surprise was almost comical.\n\n\"It is perhaps not strange that you should be aware of my residence in\nChina, Mr. Smith,\" he said; \"but my not having mentioned it may seem\nso.  The fact is\"--his sensitive face flushed in palpable\nembarrassment--\"I left China under what I may term an episcopal cloud.\nI have lived in retirement ever since.  Unwittingly--I solemnly declare\nto you, Mr. Smith, unwittingly--I stirred up certain deep-seated\nprejudices in my endeavors to do my duty--my duty.  I think you asked\nme how long I was in China?  I was there from 1896 until 1900--four\nyears.\"\n\n\"I recall the circumstances, Mr. Eltham,\" said Smith, with an odd note\nin his voice.  \"I have been endeavoring to think where I had come\nacross the name, and a moment ago I remembered.  I am happy to have met\nyou, sir.\"\n\nThe clergyman blushed again like a girl, and slightly inclined his\nhead, with its scanty fair hair.\n\n\"Has Redmoat, as its name implies, a moat round it?  I was unable to\nsee in the dusk.\"\n\n\"It remains.  Redmoat--a corruption of Round Moat--was formerly a\npriory, disestablished by the eighth Henry in 1536.\" His pedantic\nmanner was quaint at times. \"But the moat is no longer flooded. In\nfact, we grow cabbages in part of it. If you refer to the strategic\nstrength of the place\"--he smiled, but his manner was embarrassed\nagain--\"it is considerable. I have barbed wire fencing, and--other\narrangements. You see, it is a lonely spot,\" he added apologetically.\n\"And now, if you will excuse me, we will resume these gruesome\ninquiries after the more pleasant affairs of dinner.\"\n\nHe left us.\n\n\"Who is our host?\" I asked, as the door closed.\n\nSmith smiled.\n\n\"You are wondering what caused the 'episcopal cloud?'\" he suggested.\n\"Well, the deep-seated prejudices which our reverend friend stirred up\nculminated in the Boxer Risings.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Smith!\" I said; for I could not reconcile the diffident\npersonality of the clergyman with the memories which those words\nawakened.\n\n\"He evidently should be on our danger list,\" my friend continued\nquickly; \"but he has so completely effaced himself of recent years that\nI think it probable that someone else has only just recalled his\nexistence to mind.  The Rev. J. D. Eltham, my dear Petrie, though he\nmay be a poor hand at saving souls, at any rate, has saved a score of\nChristian women from death--and worse.\"\n\n\"J. D. Eltham--\" I began.\n\n\"Is 'Parson Dan'!\" rapped Smith, \"the 'Fighting Missionary,' the man\nwho with a garrison of a dozen cripples and a German doctor held the\nhospital at Nan-Yang against two hundred Boxers.  That's who the Rev.\nJ. D. Eltham is!  But what is he up to, now, I have yet to find out.\nHe is keeping something back--something which has made him an object of\ninterest to Young China!\"\n\nDuring dinner the matters responsible for our presence there did not\nhold priority in the conversation.  In fact, this, for the most part,\nconsisted in light talk of books and theaters.\n\nGreba Eltham, the clergyman's daughter, was a charming young hostess,\nand she, with Vernon Denby, Mr. Eltham's nephew, completed the party.\nNo doubt the girl's presence, in part, at any rate, led us to refrain\nfrom the subject uppermost in our minds.\n\nThese little pools of calm dotted along the torrential course of the\ncircumstances which were bearing my friend and me onward to unknown\nissues form pleasant, sunny spots in my dark recollections.\n\nSo I shall always remember, with pleasure, that dinner-party at\nRedmoat, in the old-world dining-room; it was so very peaceful, so\nalmost grotesquely calm.  For I, within my very bones, felt it to be\nthe calm before the storm.  When, later, we men passed to the library,\nwe seemed to leave that atmosphere behind us.\n\n\"Redmoat,\" said the Rev. J. D. Eltham, \"has latterly become the theater\nof strange doings.\"\n\nHe stood on the hearth-rug. A shaded lamp upon the big table and\ncandles in ancient sconces upon the mantelpiece afforded dim\nillumination.  Mr. Eltham's nephew, Vernon Denby, lolled smoking on the\nwindow-seat, and I sat near to him.  Nayland Smith paced restlessly up\nand down the room.\n\n\"Some months ago, almost a year,\" continued the clergyman, \"a\nburglarious attempt was made upon the house.  There was an arrest, and\nthe man confessed that he had been tempted by my collection.\" He waved\nhis hand vaguely towards the several cabinets about the shadowed room.\n\n\"It was shortly afterwards that I allowed my hobby for--playing at\nforts to run away with me.\"  He smiled an apology.  \"I virtually\nfortified Redmoat--against trespassers of any kind, I mean.  You have\nseen that the house stands upon a kind of large mound.  This is\nartificial, being the buried ruins of a Roman outwork; a portion of the\nancient castrum.\" Again he waved indicatively, this time toward the\nwindow.\n\n\"When it was a priory it was completely isolated and defended by its\nenvironing moat.  Today it is completely surrounded by barbed-wire\nfencing.  Below this fence, on the east, is a narrow stream, a\ntributary of the Waverney; on the north and west, the high road, but\nnearly twenty feet below, the banks being perpendicular.  On the south\nis the remaining part of the moat--now my kitchen garden; but from\nthere up to the level of the house is nearly twenty feet again, and the\nbarbed wire must also be counted with.\n\n\"The entrance, as you know, is by the way of a kind of cutting.  There\nis a gate at the foot of the steps (they are some of the original steps\nof the priory, Dr. Petrie), and another gate at the head.\"\n\nHe paused, and smiled around upon us boyishly.\n\n\"My secret defenses remain to be mentioned,\" he resumed; and, opening a\ncupboard, he pointed to a row of batteries, with a number of electric\nbells upon the wall behind.  \"The more vulnerable spots are connected\nat night with these bells,\" he said triumphantly.  \"Any attempt to\nscale the barbed wire or to force either gate would set two or more of\nthese ringing.  A stray cow raised one false alarm,\" he added, \"and a\ncareless rook threw us into a perfect panic on another occasion.\"\n\nHe was so boyish--so nervously brisk and acutely sensitive--that it was\ndifficult to see in him the hero of the Nan-Yang hospital.  I could\nonly suppose that he had treated the Boxers' raid in the same spirit\nwherein he met would-be trespassers within the precincts of Redmoat.\nIt had been an escapade, of which he was afterwards ashamed, as,\nfaintly, he was ashamed of his \"fortifications.\"  \"But,\" rapped Smith,\n\"it was not the visit of the burglar which prompted these elaborate\nprecautions.\"\n\nMr. Eltham coughed nervously.\n\n\"I am aware,\" he said, \"that having invoked official aid, I must be\nperfectly frank with you, Mr. Smith.  It was the burglar who was\nresponsible for my continuing the wire fence all round the grounds, but\nthe electrical contrivance followed, later, as a result of several\ndisturbed nights.  My servants grew uneasy about someone who came, they\nsaid, after dusk.  No one could describe this nocturnal visitor, but\ncertainly we found traces.  I must admit that.\n\n\"Then--I received what I may term a warning.  My position is a peculiar\none--a peculiar one.  My daughter, too, saw this prowling person, over\nby the Roman castrum, and described him as a yellow man.  It was the\nincident in the train following closely upon this other, which led me\nto speak to the police, little as I desired to--er--court publicity.\"\n\nNayland Smith walked to a window, and looked out across the sloping\nlawn to where the shadows of the shrubbery lay.  A dog was howling\ndismally somewhere.\n\n\"Your defenses are not impregnable, after all, then?\" he jerked.  \"On\nour way up this evening Mr. Denby was telling us about the death of his\ncollie a few nights ago.\"\n\nThe clergyman's face clouded.\n\n\"That, certainly, was alarming,\" he confessed.\n\n\"I had been in London for a few days, and during my absence Vernon came\ndown, bringing the dog with him.  On the night of his arrival it ran,\nbarking, into the shrubbery yonder, and did not come out.  He went to\nlook for it with a lantern, and found it lying among the bushes, quite\ndead.  The poor creature had been dreadfully beaten about the head.\"\n\n\"The gates were locked,\" Denby interrupted, \"and no one could have got\nout of the grounds without a ladder and someone to assist him.  But\nthere was no sign of a living thing about.  Edwards and I searched\nevery corner.\"\n\n\"How long has that other dog taken to howling?\" inquired Smith.\n\n\"Only since Rex's death,\" said Denby quickly.\n\n\"It is my mastiff,\" explained the clergyman, \"and he is confined in the\nyard.  He is never allowed on this side of the house.\"\n\nNayland Smith wandered aimlessly about the library.\n\n\"I am sorry to have to press you, Mr. Eltham,\" he said, \"but what was\nthe nature of the warning to which you referred, and from whom did it\ncome?\"\n\nMr. Eltham hesitated for a long time.\n\n\"I have been so unfortunate,\" he said at last, \"in my previous efforts,\nthat I feel assured of your hostile criticism when I tell you that I am\ncontemplating an immediate return to Ho-Nan!\"\n\nSmith jumped round upon him as though moved by a spring.\n\n\"Then you are going back to Nan-Yang?\" he cried.  \"Now I understand!\nWhy have you not told me before?  That is the key for which I have\nvainly been seeking.  Your troubles date from the time of your decision\nto return?\"\n\n\"Yes, I must admit it,\" confessed the clergyman diffidently.\n\n\"And your warning came from China?\"\n\n\"It did.\"\n\n\"From a Chinaman?\"\n\n\"From the Mandarin, Yen-Sun-Yat.\"\n\n\"Yen-Sun-Yat!  My good sir!  He warned you to abandon your visit?  And\nyou reject his advice?  Listen to me.\"  Smith was intensely excited\nnow, his eyes bright, his lean figure curiously strung up, alert.  \"The\nMandarin Yen-Sun-Yat is one of the seven!\"\n\n\"I do not follow you, Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"No, sir.  China to-day is not the China of '98.  It is a huge secret\nmachine, and Ho-Nan one of its most important wheels!  But if, as I\nunderstand, this official is a friend of yours, believe me, he has\nsaved your life!  You would be a dead man now if it were not for your\nfriend in China!  My dear sir, you must accept his counsel.\"\n\nThen, for the first time since I had made his acquaintance, \"Parson\nDan\" showed through the surface of the Rev. J. D. Eltham.\n\n\"No, sir!\" replied the clergyman--and the change in his voice was\nstartling.  \"I am called to Nan-Yang. Only One may deter my going.\"\n\nThe admixture of deep spiritual reverence with intense truculence in\nhis voice was dissimilar from anything I ever had heard.\n\n\"Then only One can protect you,\" cried Smith, \"for, by Heaven, no MAN\nwill be able to do so!  Your presence in Ho-Nan can do no possible good\nat present.  It must do harm.  Your experience in 1900 should be fresh\nin your memory.\"\n\n\"Hard words, Mr. Smith.\"\n\n\"The class of missionary work which you favor, sir, is injurious to\ninternational peace.  At the present moment, Ho-Nan is a barrel of\ngunpowder; you would be the lighted match.  I do not willingly stand\nbetween any man and what he chooses to consider his duty, but I insist\nthat you abandon your visit to the interior of China!\"\n\n\"You insist, Mr. Smith?\"\n\n\"As your guest, I regret the necessity for reminding you that I hold\nauthority to enforce it.\"\n\nDenby fidgeted uneasily.  The tone of the conversation was growing\nharsh and the atmosphere of the library portentous with brewing storms.\n\nThere was a short, silent interval.\n\n\"This is what I had feared and expected,\" said the clergyman.  \"This\nwas my reason for not seeking official protection.\"\n\n\"The phantom Yellow Peril,\" said Nayland Smith, \"to-day materializes\nunder the very eyes of the Western world.\"\n\n\"The 'Yellow Peril'!\"\n\n\"You scoff, sir, and so do others.  We take the proffered right hand of\nfriendship nor inquire if the hidden left holds a knife!  The peace of\nthe world is at stake, Mr. Eltham.  Unknowingly, you tamper with\ntremendous issues.\"\n\nMr. Eltham drew a deep breath, thrusting both hands in his pockets.\n\n\"You are painfully frank, Mr. Smith,\" he said; \"but I like you for it.\nI will reconsider my position and talk this matter over again with you\nto-morrow.\"\n\nThus, then, the storm blew over.  Yet I had never experienced such an\noverwhelming sense of imminent peril--of a sinister presence--as\noppressed me at that moment.  The very atmosphere of Redmoat was\nimpregnated with Eastern devilry; it loaded the air like some evil\nperfume.  And then, through the silence, cut a throbbing scream--the\nscream of a woman in direst fear.\n\n\"My God, it's Greba!\" whispered Mr. Eltham.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nIN what order we dashed down to the drawing-room I cannot recall.  But\nnone was before me when I leaped over the threshold and saw Miss Eltham\nprone by the French windows.\n\nThese were closed and bolted, and she lay with hands outstretched in\nthe alcove which they formed.  I bent over her.  Nayland Smith was at\nmy elbow.\n\n\"Get my bag\" I said.  \"She has swooned.  It is nothing serious.\"\n\nHer father, pale and wide-eyed, hovered about me, muttering\nincoherently; but I managed to reassure him; and his gratitude when, I\nhaving administered a simple restorative, the girl sighed shudderingly\nand opened her eyes, was quite pathetic.\n\nI would permit no questioning at that time, and on her father's arm she\nretired to her own rooms.\n\nIt was some fifteen minutes later that her message was brought to me.\nI followed the maid to a quaint little octagonal apartment, and Greba\nEltham stood before me, the candlelight caressing the soft curves of\nher face and gleaming in the meshes of her rich brown hair.\n\nWhen she had answered my first question she hesitated in pretty\nconfusion.\n\n\"We are anxious to know what alarmed you, Miss Eltham.\"\n\nShe bit her lip and glanced with apprehension towards the window.\n\n\"I am almost afraid to tell father,\" she began rapidly.  \"He will think\nme imaginative, but you have been so kind.  It was two green eyes!  Oh!\nDr. Petrie, they looked up at me from the steps leading to the lawn.\nAnd they shone like the eyes of a cat.\"\n\nThe words thrilled me strangely.\n\n\"Are you sure it was not a cat, Miss Eltham?\"\n\n\"The eyes were too large, Dr. Petrie.  There was something dreadful,\nmost dreadful, in their appearance.  I feel foolish and silly for\nhaving fainted, twice in two days!  But the suspense is telling upon\nme, I suppose.  Father thinks\"--she was becoming charmingly\nconfidential, as a woman often will with a tactful physician--\"that\nshut up here we are safe from--whatever threatens us.\" I noted, with\nconcern, a repetition of the nervous shudder.  \"But since our return\nsomeone else has been in Redmoat!\"\n\n\"Whatever do you mean, Miss Eltham?\"\n\n\"Oh!  I don't quite know what I do mean, Dr. Petrie.  What does it ALL\nmean?  Vernon has been explaining to me that some awful Chinaman is\nseeking the life of Mr. Nayland Smith.  But if the same man wants to\nkill my father, why has he not done so?\"\n\n\"I am afraid you puzzle me.\"\n\n\"Of course, I must do so.  But--the man in the train.  He could have\nkilled us both quite easily!  And--last night someone was in father's\nroom.\"\n\n\"In his room!\"\n\n\"I could not sleep, and I heard something moving.  My room is the next\none.  I knocked on the wall and woke father.  There was nothing; so I\nsaid it was the howling of the dog that had frightened me.\"\n\n\"How could anyone get into his room?\"\n\n\"I cannot imagine.  But I am not sure it was a man.\"\n\n\"Miss Eltham, you alarm me.  What do you suspect?\"\n\n\"You must think me hysterical and silly, but whilst father and I have\nbeen away from Redmoat perhaps the usual precautions have been\nneglected.  Is there any creature, any large creature, which could\nclimb up the wall to the window?  Do you know of anything with a long,\nthin body?\"\n\nFor a moment I offered no reply, studying the girl's pretty face, her\neager, blue-gray eyes widely opened and fixed upon mine.  She was not\nof the neurotic type, with her clear complexion and sun-kissed neck;\nher arms, healthily toned by exposure to the country airs, were rounded\nand firm, and she had the agile shape of a young Diana with none of the\nanaemic languor which breeds morbid dreams.  She was frightened; yes,\nwho would not have been?  But the mere idea of this thing which she\nbelieved to be in Redmoat, without the apparition of the green eyes,\nmust have prostrated a victim of \"nerves.\"\n\n\"Have you seen such a creature, Miss Eltham?\"\n\nShe hesitated again, glancing down and pressing her finger-tips\ntogether.\n\n\"As father awoke and called out to know why I knocked, I glanced from\nmy window.  The moonlight threw half the lawn into shadow, and just\ndisappearing in this shadow was something--something of a brown color,\nmarked with sections!\"\n\n\"What size and shape?\"\n\n\"It moved so quickly I could form no idea of its shape; but I saw quite\nsix feet of it flash across the grass!\"\n\n\"Did you hear anything?\"\n\n\"A swishing sound in the shrubbery, then nothing more.\"\n\nShe met my eyes expectantly.  Her confidence in my powers of\nunderstanding and sympathy was gratifying, though I knew that I but\noccupied the position of a father-confessor.\n\n\"Have you any idea,\" I said, \"how it came about that you awoke in the\ntrain yesterday whilst your father did not?\"\n\n\"We had coffee at a refreshment-room; it must have been drugged in some\nway.  I scarcely tasted mine, the flavor was so awful; but father is an\nold traveler and drank the whole of his cupful!\"\n\nMr. Eltham's voice called from below.\n\n\"Dr. Petrie,\" said the girl quickly, \"what do you think they want to do\nto him?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I replied, \"I wish I knew that.\"\n\n\"Will you think over what I have told you?  For I do assure you there\nis something here in Redmoat--something that comes and goes in spite of\nfather's 'fortifications'?  Caesar knows there is.  Listen to him.  He\ndrags at his chain so that I wonder he does not break it.\"\n\nAs we passed downstairs the howling of the mastiff sounded eerily\nthrough the house, as did the clank-clank of the tightening chain as he\nthrew the weight of his big body upon it.\n\nI sat in Smith's room that night for some time, he pacing the floor\nsmoking and talking.\n\n\"Eltham has influential Chinese friends,\" he said; \"but they dare not\nhave him in Nan-Yang at present.  He knows the country as he knows\nNorfolk; he would see things!\n\n\"His precautions here have baffled the enemy, I think.  The attempt in\nthe train points to an anxiety to waste no opportunity.  But whilst\nEltham was absent (he was getting his outfit in London, by the way)\nthey have been fixing some second string to their fiddle here.  In case\nno opportunity offered before he returned, they provided for getting at\nhim here!\"\n\n\"But how, Smith?\"\n\n\"That's the mystery.  But the dead dog in the shrubbery is significant.\"\n\n\"Do you think some emissary of Fu-Manchu is actually inside the moat?\"\n\n\"It's impossible, Petrie.  You are thinking of secret passages, and so\nforth.  There are none.  Eltham has measured up every foot of the\nplace.  There isn't a rathole left unaccounted for; and as for a tunnel\nunder the moat, the house stands on a solid mass of Roman masonry, a\nformer camp of Hadrian's time.  I have seen a very old plan of the\nRound Moat Priory as it was called.  There is no entrance and no exit\nsave by the steps.  So how was the dog killed?\"\n\nI knocked out my pipe on a bar of the grate.\n\n\"We are in the thick of it here,\" I said.\n\n\"We are always in the thick of it,\" replied Smith.  \"Our danger is no\ngreater in Norfolk than in London.  But what do they want to do?  That\nman in the train with the case of instruments--WHAT instruments?  Then\nthe apparition of the green eyes to-night. Can they have been the eyes\nof Fu-Manchu?  Is some peculiarly unique outrage contemplated--something\ncalling for the presence of the master?\"\n\n\"He may have to prevent Eltham's leaving England without killing him.\"\n\n\"Quite so.  He probably has instructions to be merciful.  But God help\nthe victim of Chinese mercy!\"\n\nI went to my own room then.  But I did not even undress, refilling my\npipe and seating myself at the open window.  Having looked upon the\nawful Chinese doctor, the memory of his face, with its filmed green\neyes, could never leave me.  The idea that he might be near at that\nmoment was a poor narcotic.\n\nThe howling and baying of the mastiff was almost continuous.\n\nWhen all else in Redmoat was still the dog's mournful note yet rose on\nthe night with something menacing in it.  I sat looking out across the\nsloping turf to where the shrubbery showed as a black island in a green\nsea.  The moon swam in a cloudless sky, and the air was warm and\nfragrant with country scents.\n\nIt was in the shrubbery that Denby's collie had met his mysterious\ndeath--that the thing seen by Miss Eltham had disappeared.  What\nuncanny secret did it hold?\n\nCaesar became silent.\n\nAs the stopping of a clock will sometimes awaken a sleeper, the abrupt\ncessation of that distant howling, to which I had grown accustomed, now\nrecalled me from a world of gloomy imaginings.\n\nI glanced at my watch in the moonlight.  It was twelve minutes past\nmidnight.\n\nAs I replaced it the dog suddenly burst out afresh, but now in a tone\nof sheer anger.  He was alternately howling and snarling in a way that\nsounded new to me.  The crashes, as he leapt to the end of his chain,\nshook the building in which he was confined.  It was as I stood up to\nlean from the window and commanded a view of the corner of the house\nthat he broke loose.\n\nWith a hoarse bay he took that decisive leap, and I heard his heavy\nbody fall against the wooden wall.  There followed a strange, guttural\ncry . . . and the growling of the dog died away at the rear of the house.\nHe was out!  But that guttural note had not come from the throat of a\ndog.  Of what was he in pursuit?\n\nAt which point his mysterious quarry entered the shrubbery I do not\nknow.  I only know that I saw absolutely nothing, until Caesar's lithe\nshape was streaked across the lawn, and the great creature went\ncrashing into the undergrowth.\n\nThen a faint sound above and to my right told me that I was not the\nonly spectator of the scene.  I leaned farther from the window.\n\n\"Is that you, Miss Eltham?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Petrie!\" she said.  \"I am so glad you are awake.  Can we do\nnothing to help?  Caesar will be killed.\"\n\n\"Did you see what he went after?\"\n\n\"No,\" she called back, and drew her breath sharply.\n\nFor a strange figure went racing across the grass.  It was that of a\nman in a blue dressing-gown, who held a lantern high before him, and a\nrevolver in his right hand.  Coincident with my recognition of Mr.\nEltham he leaped, plunging into the shrubbery in the wake of the dog.\n\nBut the night held yet another surprise; for Nayland Smith's voice came:\n\n\"Come back!  Come back, Eltham!\"\n\nI ran out into the passage and downstairs.  The front door was open.  A\nterrible conflict waged in the shrubbery, between the mastiff and\nsomething else.  Passing round to the lawn, I met Smith fully dressed.\nHe just had dropped from a first-floor window.\n\n\"The man is mad!\" he snapped.  \"Heaven knows what lurks there!  He\nshould not have gone alone!\"\n\nTogether we ran towards the dancing light of Eltham's lantern.  The\nsounds of conflict ceased suddenly.  Stumbling over stumps and lashed\nby low-sweeping branches, we struggled forward to where the clergyman\nknelt amongst the bushes.  He glanced up with tears in his eyes, as was\nrevealed by the dim light.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried.\n\nThe body of the dog lay at his feet.\n\nIt was pitiable to think that the fearless brute should have met his\ndeath in such a fashion, and when I bent and examined him I was glad to\nfind traces of life.\n\n\"Drag him out.  He is not dead,\" I said.\n\n\"And hurry,\" rapped Smith, peering about him right and left.\n\nSo we three hurried from that haunted place, dragging the dog with us.\nWe were not molested.  No sound disturbed the now perfect stillness.\n\nBy the lawn edge we came upon Denby, half dressed; and almost\nimmediately Edwards the gardener also appeared.  The white faces of the\nhouse servants showed at one window, and Miss Eltham called to me from\nher room:\n\n\"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied; \"only stunned.\"\n\nWe carried the dog round to the yard, and I examined his head.  It had\nbeen struck by some heavy blunt instrument, but the skull was not\nbroken.  It is hard to kill a mastiff.\n\n\"Will you attend to him, Doctor?\" asked Eltham.  \"We must see that the\nvillain does not escape.\"\n\nHis face was grim and set.  This was a different man from the diffident\nclergyman we knew:  this was \"Parson Dan\" again.\n\nI accepted the care of the canine patient, and Eltham with the others\nwent off for more lights to search the shrubbery.  As I was washing a\nbad wound between the mastiff's ears, Miss Eltham joined me.  It was\nthe sound of her voice, I think, rather than my more scientific\nministration, which recalled Caesar to life.  For, as she entered, his\ntail wagged feebly, and a moment later he struggled to his feet--one of\nwhich was injured.\n\nHaving provided for his immediate needs, I left him in charge of his\nyoung mistress and joined the search party.  They had entered the\nshrubbery from four points and drawn blank.\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing there, and no one can possibly have left\nthe grounds,\" said Eltham amazedly.\n\nWe stood on the lawn looking at one another, Nayland Smith, angry but\nthoughtful, tugging at the lobe of his left ear, as was his habit in\nmoments of perplexity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nWITH the first coming of light, Eltham, Smith and I tested the\nelectrical contrivances from every point.  They were in perfect order.\nIt became more and more incomprehensible how anyone could have entered\nand quitted Redmoat during the night.  The barbed-wire fencing was\nintact, and bore no signs of having been tampered with.\n\nSmith and I undertook an exhaustive examination of the shrubbery.\n\nAt the spot where we had found the dog, some five paces to the west of\nthe copper beech, the grass and weeds were trampled and the surrounding\nlaurels and rhododendrons bore evidence of a struggle, but no human\nfootprint could be found.\n\n\"The ground is dry,\" said Smith.  \"We cannot expect much.\"\n\n\"In my opinion,\" I said, \"someone tried to get at Caesar; his presence\nis dangerous.  And in his rage he broke loose.\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed Smith.  \"But why did this person make for\nhere?  And how, having mastered the dog, get out of Redmoat?  I am open\nto admit the possibility of someone's getting in during the day whilst\nthe gates are open, and hiding until dusk.  But how in the name of all\nthat's wonderful does he GET OUT?  He must possess the attributes of a\nbird.\"\n\nI thought of Greba Eltham's statements, reminding my friend of her\ndescription of the thing which she had seen passing into this strangely\nhaunted shrubbery.\n\n\"That line of speculation soon takes us out of our depth, Petrie,\" he\nsaid.  \"Let us stick to what we can understand, and that may help us to\na clearer idea of what, at present, is incomprehensible.  My view of\nthe case to date stands thus:\n\n\"(1) Eltham, having rashly decided to return to the interior of China,\nis warned by an official whose friendship he has won in some way to\nstay in England.\n\n\"(2) I know this official for one of the Yellow group represented in\nEngland by Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\n\"(3) Several attempts, of which we know but little, to get at Eltham\nare frustrated, presumably by his curious 'defenses.' An attempt in a\ntrain fails owing to Miss Eltham's distaste for refreshment-room\ncoffee.  An attempt here fails owing to her insomnia.\n\n\"(4) During Eltham's absence from Redmoat certain preparations are made\nfor his return.  These lead to:\n\n\"(a) The death of Denby's collie;\n\n\"(b) The things heard and seen by Miss Eltham;\n\n\"(c) The things heard and seen by us all last night.\n\n\"So that the clearing up of my fourth point--id est, the discovery of\nthe nature of these preparations--becomes our immediate concern.  The\nprime object of these preparations, Petrie, was to enable someone to\ngain access to Eltham's room.  The other events are incidental.  The\ndogs HAD to be got rid of, for instance; and there is no doubt that\nMiss Eltham's wakefulness saved her father a second time.\"\n\n\"But from what?  For Heaven's sake, from what?\"\n\nSmith glanced about into the light-patched shadows.\n\n\"From a visit by someone--perhaps by Fu-Manchu himself,\" he said in a\nhushed voice.  \"The object of that visit I hope we may never learn; for\nthat would mean that it had been achieved.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, \"I do not altogether understand you; but do you think\nhe has some incredible creature hidden here somewhere?  It would be\nlike him.\"\n\n\"I begin to suspect the most formidable creature in the known world to\nbe hidden here.  I believe Fu-Manchu is somewhere inside Redmoat!\"\n\nOur conversation was interrupted at this point by Denby, who came to\nreport that he had examined the moat, the roadside, and the bank of the\nstream, but found no footprints or clew of any kind.\n\n\"No one left the grounds of Redmoat last night, I think,\" he said.  And\nhis voice had awe in it.\n\nThat day dragged slowly on.  A party of us scoured the neighborhood for\ntraces of strangers, examining every foot of the Roman ruin hard by;\nbut vainly.\n\n\"May not your presence here induce Fu-Manchu to abandon his plans?\" I\nasked Smith.\n\n\"I think not,\" he replied.  \"You see, unless we can prevail upon him,\nEltham sails in a fortnight.  So the Doctor has no time to waste.\nFurthermore, I have an idea that his arrangements are of such a\ncharacter that they MUST go forward.  He might turn aside, of course,\nto assassinate me, if opportunity arose!  But we know, from experience,\nthat he permits nothing to interfere with his schemes.\"\n\nThere are few states, I suppose, which exact so severe a toll from\none's nervous system as the ANTICIPATION of calamity.\n\nAll anticipation is keener, be it of joy or pain, than the reality\nwhereof it is a mental forecast; but that inactive waiting at Redmoat,\nfor the blow which we knew full well to be pending exceeded in its\nnerve taxation, anything I hitherto had experienced.\n\nI felt as one bound upon an Aztec altar, with the priest's obsidian\nknife raised above my breast!\n\nSecret and malign forces throbbed about us; forces against which we had\nno armor.  Dreadful as it was, I count it a mercy that the climax was\nreached so quickly.  And it came suddenly enough; for there in that\nquiet Norfolk home we found ourselves at hand grips with one of the\nmysterious horrors which characterized the operations of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\nIt was upon us before we realized it.  There is no incidental music to\nthe dramas of real life.\n\nAs we sat on the little terrace in the creeping twilight, I remember\nthinking how the peace of the scene gave the lie to my fears that we\nbordered upon tragic things.  Then Caesar, who had been a docile\npatient all day, began howling again; and I saw Greba Eltham shudder.\n\nI caught Smith's eye, and was about to propose our retirement indoors,\nwhen the party was broken up in more turbulent fashion.  I suppose it\nwas the presence of the girl which prompted Denby to the rash act, a\ndesire personally to distinguish himself.  But, as I recalled\nafterwards, his gaze had rarely left the shrubbery since dusk, save to\nseek her face, and now he leaped wildly to his feet, overturning his\nchair, and dashed across the grass to the trees.\n\n\"Did you see it?\" he yelled.  \"Did you see it?\"\n\nHe evidently carried a revolver.  For from the edge of the shrubbery a\nshot sounded, and in the flash we saw Denby with the weapon raised.\n\n\"Greba, go in and fasten the windows,\" cried Eltham.  \"Mr. Smith, will\nyou enter the bushes from the west.  Dr. Petrie, east.  Edwards,\nEdwards--\" And he was off across the lawn with the nervous activity of\na cat.\n\nAs I made off in an opposite direction I heard the gardener's voice\nfrom the lower gate, and I saw Eltham's plan.  It was to surround the\nshrubbery.\n\nTwo more shots and two flashes from the dense heart of greenwood.  Then\na loud cry--I thought, from Denby--and a second, muffled one.\n\nFollowing--silence, only broken by the howling of the mastiff.\n\nI sprinted through the rose garden, leaped heedlessly over a bed of\ngeranium and heliotrope, and plunged in among the bushes and under the\nelms.  Away on the left I heard Edwards shouting, and Eltham's\nanswering voice.\n\n\"Denby!\" I cried, and yet louder:  \"Denby!\"\n\nBut the silence fell again.\n\nDusk was upon Redmoat now, but from sitting in the twilight my eyes had\ngrown accustomed to gloom, and I could see fairly well what lay before\nme.  Not daring to think what might lurk above, below, around me, I\npressed on into the midst of the thicket.\n\n\"Vernon!\" came Eltham's voice from one side.\n\n\"Bear more to the right, Edwards,\" I heard Nayland Smith cry directly\nahead of me.\n\nWith an eerie and indescribable sensation of impending disaster upon\nme, I thrust my way through to a gray patch which marked a break in the\nelmen roof.  At the foot of the copper beech I almost fell over Eltham.\nThen Smith plunged into view.  Lastly, Edwards the gardener rounded a\nbig rhododendron and completed the party.\n\nWe stood quite still for a moment.\n\nA faint breeze whispered through the beech leaves.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\nI cannot remember who put it into words; I was too dazed with amazement\nto notice.  Then Eltham began shouting:\n\n\"Vernon!  Vernon!  VERNON!\"\n\nHis voice pitched higher upon each repetition.  There was something\nhorrible about that vain calling, under the whispering beech, with\nshrubs banked about us cloaking God alone could know what.\n\nFrom the back of the house came Caesar's faint reply.\n\n\"Quick!  Lights!\" rapped Smith.  \"Every lamp you have!\"\n\nOff we went, dodging laurels and privets, and poured out on to the\nlawn, a disordered company.  Eltham's face was deathly pale, and his\njaw set hard.  He met my eye.\n\n\"God forgive me!\" he said.  \"I could do murder to-night!\"\n\nHe was a man composed of strange perplexities.\n\nIt seemed an age before the lights were found.  But at last we returned\nto the bushes, really after a very brief delay; and ten minutes\nsufficed us to explore the entire shrubbery, for it was not extensive.\nWe found his revolver, but there was no one there--nothing.\n\nWhen we all stood again on the lawn, I thought that I had never seen\nSmith so haggard.\n\n\"What in Heaven's name can we do?\" he muttered.  \"What does it mean?\"\n\nHe expected no answer; for there was none to offer one.\n\n\"Search!  Everywhere,\" said Eltham hoarsely.\n\nHe ran off into the rose garden, and began beating about among the\nflowers like a madman, muttering:  \"Vernon!  Vernon!\"  For close upon\nan hour we all searched.  We searched every square yard, I think,\nwithin the wire fencing, and found no trace.  Miss Eltham slipped out\nin the confusion, and joined with the rest of us in that frantic hunt.\nSome of the servants assisted too.\n\nIt was a group terrified and awestricken which came together again on\nthe terrace.  One and then another would give up, until only Eltham and\nSmith were missing.  Then they came back together from examining the\nsteps to the lower gate.\n\nEltham dropped on to a rustic seat, and sank his head in his hands.\n\nNayland Smith paced up and down like a newly caged animal, snapping his\nteeth together and tugging at his ear.\n\nPossessed by some sudden idea, or pressed to action by his tumultuous\nthoughts, he snatched up a lantern and strode silently off across the\ngrass and to the shrubbery once more.  I followed him.  I think his\nidea was that he might surprise anyone who lurked there.  He surprised\nhimself, and all of us.\n\nFor right at the margin he tripped and fell flat.  I ran to him.\n\nHe had fallen over the body of Denby, which lay there!\n\nDenby had not been there a few moments before, and how he came to be\nthere now we dared not conjecture.  Mr. Eltham joined us, uttered one\nshort, dry sob, and dropped upon his knees.  Then we were carrying\nDenby back to the house, with the mastiff howling a marche funebre.\n\nWe laid him on the grass where it sloped down from the terrace.\nNayland Smith's haggard face was terrible.  But the stark horror of the\nthing inspired him to that, which conceived earlier, had saved Denby.\nTwisting suddenly to Eltham, he roared in a voice audible beyond the\nriver:\n\n\"Heavens!  we are fools!  LOOSE THE DOG!\"\n\n\"But the dog--\" I began.\n\nSmith clapped his hand over my mouth.\n\n\"I know he's crippled,\" he whispered.  \"But if anything human lurks\nthere, the dog will lead us to it.  If a MAN is there, he will fly!\nWhy did we not think of it before.  Fools, fools!\"  He raised his voice\nagain.  \"Keep him on leash, Edwards.  He will lead us.\"\n\nThe scheme succeeded.\n\nEdwards barely had started on his errand when bells began ringing\ninside the house.\n\n\"Wait!\" snapped Eltham, and rushed indoors.\n\nA moment later he was out again, his eyes gleaming madly.  \"Above the\nmoat,\" he panted.  And we were off en masse round the edge of the trees.\n\nIt was dark above the moat; but not so dark as to prevent our seeing a\nnarrow ladder of thin bamboo joints and silken cord hanging by two\nhooks from the top of the twelve-foot wire fence.  There was no sound.\n\n\"He's out!\" screamed Eltham.  \"Down the steps!\"\n\nWe all ran our best and swiftest.  But Eltham outran us.  Like a fury\nhe tore at bolts and bars, and like a fury sprang out into the road.\nStraight and white it showed to the acclivity by the Roman ruin.  But\nno living thing moved upon it.  The distant baying of the dog was borne\nto our ears.\n\n\"Curse it!  he's crippled,\" hissed Smith.  \"Without him, as well pursue\na shadow!\"\n\n\nA few hours later the shrubbery yielded up its secret, a simple one\nenough: A big cask sunk in a pit, with a laurel shrub cunningly affixed\nto its movable lid, which was further disguised with tufts of grass.  A\nslender bamboo-jointed rod lay near the fence.  It had a hook on the\ntop, and was evidently used for attaching the ladder.\n\n\"It was the end of this ladder which Miss Eltham saw,\" said Smith, \"as\nhe trailed it behind him into the shrubbery when she interrupted him in\nher fathers room.  He and whomever he had with him doubtless slipped in\nduring the daytime--whilst Eltham was absent in London--bringing the\nprepared cask and all necessary implements with them.  They concealed\nthemselves somewhere--probably in the shrubbery--and during the night\nmade the cache.  The excavated earth would be disposed of on the\nflower-beds; the dummy bush they probably had ready.  You see, the\nproblem of getting IN was never a big one.  But owing to the 'defenses'\nit was impossible (whilst Eltham was in residence at any rate) to get\nOUT after dark.  For Fu-Manchu's purposes, then, a working-base INSIDE\nRedmoat was essential.  His servant--for he needed assistance--must\nhave been in hiding somewhere outside; Heaven knows where!  During the\nday they could come or go by the gates, as we have already noted.\"\n\n\"You think it was the Doctor himself?\"\n\n\"It seems possible.  Who else has eyes like the eyes Miss Eltham saw\nfrom the window last night?\"\n\nThen remains to tell the nature of the outrage whereby Fu-Manchu had\nplanned to prevent Eltham's leaving England for China.  This we learned\nfrom Denby.  For Denby was not dead.\n\nIt was easy to divine that he had stumbled upon the fiendish visitor at\nthe very entrance to his burrow; had been stunned (judging from the\nevidence, with a sand-bag), and dragged down into the cache--to which\nhe must have lain in such dangerous proximity as to render detection of\nthe dummy bush possible in removing him.  The quickest expedient, then,\nhad been to draw him beneath.  When the search of the shrubbery was\nconcluded, his body had been borne to the edge of the bushes and laid\nwhere we found it.\n\nWhy his life had been spared, I cannot conjecture, but provision had\nbeen made against his recovering consciousness and revealing the secret\nof the shrubbery.  The ruse of releasing the mastiff alone had\nterminated the visit of the unbidden guest within Redmoat.\n\nDenby made a very slow recovery; and, even when convalescent,\nconsciously added not one fact to those we already had collated; his\nmemory had completely deserted him!\n\nThis, in my opinion, as in those of the several specialists consulted,\nwas due, not to the blow on the head, but to the presence, slightly\nbelow and to the right of the first cervical curve of the spine, of a\nminute puncture--undoubtedly caused by a hypodermic syringe.  Then,\nunconsciously, poor Denby furnished the last link in the chain; for\nundoubtedly, by means of this operation, Fu-Manchu had designed to\nefface from Eltham's mind his plans of return to Ho-Nan.\n\nThe nature of the fluid which could produce such mental symptoms was a\nmystery--a mystery which defied Western science: one of the many\nstrange secrets of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nSINCE Nayland Smith's return from Burma I had rarely taken up a paper\nwithout coming upon evidences of that seething which had cast up Dr.\nFu-Manchu. Whether, hitherto, such items had escaped my attention or\nhad seemed to demand no particular notice, or whether they now became\nincreasingly numerous, I was unable to determine.\n\nOne evening, some little time after our sojourn in Norfolk, in glancing\nthrough a number of papers which I had brought in with me, I chanced\nupon no fewer than four items of news bearing more or less directly\nupon the grim business which engaged my friend and I.\n\nNo white man, I honestly believe, appreciates the unemotional cruelty\nof the Chinese.  Throughout the time that Dr. Fu-Manchu remained in\nEngland, the press preserved a uniform silence upon the subject of his\nexistence.  This was due to Nayland Smith.  But, as a result, I feel\nassured that my account of the Chinaman's deeds will, in many quarters,\nmeet with an incredulous reception.\n\nI had been at work, earlier in the evening, upon the opening chapters\nof this chronicle, and I had realized how difficult it would be for my\nreader, amid secure and cozy surroundings, to credit any human being\nwith a callous villainy great enough to conceive and to put into\nexecution such a death pest as that directed against Sir Crichton Davey.\n\nOne would expect God's worst man to shrink from employing--against\nhowever vile an enemy--such an instrument as the Zayat Kiss.  So\nthinking, my eye was caught by the following:--\n\n\nEXPRESS CORRESPONDENT\n\nNEW YORK.\n\n\"Secret service men of the United States Government are searching the\nSouth Sea Islands for a certain Hawaiian from the island of Maui, who,\nit is believed, has been selling poisonous scorpions to Chinese in\nHonolulu anxious to get rid of their children.\n\n\"Infanticide, by scorpion and otherwise, among the Chinese, has\nincreased so terribly that the authorities have started a searching\ninquiry, which has led to the hunt for the scorpion dealer of Maui.\n\n\"Practically all the babies that die mysteriously are unwanted girls,\nand in nearly every case the parents promptly ascribe the death to the\nbite of a scorpion, and are ready to produce some more or less\npoisonous insect in support of the statement.\n\n\"The authorities have no doubt that infanticide by scorpion bite is a\ngrowing practice, and orders have been given to hunt down the scorpion\ndealer at any cost.\"\n\n\nIs it any matter for wonder that such a people had produced a\nFu-Manchu?  I pasted the cutting into a scrap-book, determined that, if\nI lived to publish my account of those days, I would quote it therein\nas casting a sidelight upon Chinese character.\n\nA Reuter message to The Globe and a paragraph in The Star also\nfurnished work for my scissors.  Here were evidences of the deep-seated\nunrest, the secret turmoil, which manifested itself so far from its\ncenter as peaceful England in the person of the sinister Doctor.\n\n\n\"HONG KONG, Friday.\n\n\"Li Hon Hung, the Chinaman who fired at the Governor yesterday, was\ncharged before the magistrate with shooting at him with intent to kill,\nwhich is equivalent to attempted murder.  The prisoner, who was not\ndefended, pleaded guilty.  The Assistant Crown Solicitor, who\nprosecuted, asked for a remand until Monday, which was granted.\n\n\"Snapshots taken by the spectators of the outrage yesterday disclosed\nthe presence of an accomplice, also armed with a revolver.  It is\nreported that this man, who was arrested last night, was in possession\nof incriminating documentary evidence.\"\n\n\nLater.\n\n\"Examination of the documents found on Li Hon Hung's accomplice has\ndisclosed the fact that both men were well financed by the Canton Triad\nSociety, the directors of which had enjoined the assassination of Sir\nF. M. or Mr. C. S., the Colonial Secretary.  In a report prepared by\nthe accomplice for dispatch to Canton, also found on his person, he\nexpressed regret that the attempt had failed.\"--Reuter.\n\n\"It is officially reported in St. Petersburg that a force of Chinese\nsoldiers and villagers surrounded the house of a Russian subject named\nSaid Effendi, near Khotan, in Chinese Turkestan.\n\n\"They fired at the house and set it in flames.  There were in the house\nabout 100 Russians, many of whom were killed.\n\n\"The Russian Government has instructed its Minister at Peking to make\nthe most vigorous representations on the subject.\"--Reuter.\n\n\nFinally, in a Personal Column, I found the following:--\n\n\"HO-NAN. Have abandoned visit.--ELTHAM.\"\n\n\nI had just pasted it into my book when Nayland Smith came in and threw\nhimself into an arm-chair, facing me across the table.  I showed him\nthe cutting.\n\n\"I am glad, for Eltham's sake--and for the girl's,\" was his comment.\n\"But it marks another victory for Fu-Manchu!  Just Heaven!  Why is\nretribution delayed!\"\n\nSmith's darkly tanned face had grown leaner than ever since he had\nbegun his fight with the most uncanny opponent, I suppose, against whom\na man ever had pitted himself. He stood up and began restlessly to pace\nthe room, furiously stuffing tobacco into his briar.\n\n\"I have seen Sir Lionel Barton,\" he said abruptly; \"and, to put the\nwhole thing in a nutshell, he has laughed at me!  During the months\nthat I have been wondering where he had gone to he has been somewhere\nin Egypt.  He certainly bears a charmed life, for on the evidence of\nhis letter to The Times he has seen things in Tibet which Fu-Manchu\nwould have the West blind to; in fact, I think he has found a new\nkeyhole to the gate of the Indian Empire!\"\n\nLong ago we had placed the name of Sir Lionel Barton upon the list of\nthose whose lives stood between Fu-Manchu and the attainment of his\nend.  Orientalist and explorer, the fearless traveler who first had\npenetrated to Lhassa, who thrice, as a pilgrim, had entered forbidden\nMecca, he now had turned his attention again to Tibet--thereby signing\nhis own death-warrant.\n\n\"That he has reached England alive is a hopeful sign?\" I suggested.\n\nSmith shook his head, and lighted the blackened briar.\n\n\"England at present is the web,\" he replied.  \"The spider will be\nwaiting.  Petrie, I sometimes despair.  Sir Lionel is an impossible man\nto shepherd.  You ought to see his house at Finchley.  A low, squat\nplace completely hemmed in by trees.  Damp as a swamp; smells like a\njungle.  Everything topsy-turvy. He only arrived to-day, and he is\nworking and eating (and sleeping I expect), in a study that looks like\nan earthquake at Sotheby's auction-rooms. The rest of the house is half\na menagerie and half a circus.  He has a Bedouin groom, a Chinese\nbody-servant, and Heaven only knows what other strange people!\"\n\n\"Chinese!\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw him; a squinting Cantonese he calls Kwee.  I don't like\nhim.  Also, there is a secretary known as Strozza, who has an\nunpleasant face.  He is a fine linguist, I understand, and is engaged\nupon the Spanish notes for Barton's forthcoming book on the Mayapan\ntemples.  By the way, all Sir Lionel's baggage disappeared from the\nlanding-stage--including his Tibetan notes.\"\n\n\"Significant!\"\n\n\"Of course.  But he argues that he has crossed Tibet from the Kuen-Lun\nto the Himalayas without being assassinated, and therefore that it is\nunlikely he will meet with that fate in London.  I left him dictating\nthe book from memory, at the rate of about two hundred words a minute.\"\n\n\"He is wasting no time.\"\n\n\"Wasting time!  In addition to the Yucatan book and the work on Tibet,\nhe has to read a paper at the Institute next week about some tomb he\nhas unearthed in Egypt.  As I came away, a van drove up from the docks\nand a couple of fellows delivered a sarcophagus as big as a boat.  It\nis unique, according to Sir Lionel, and will go to the British Museum\nafter he has examined it.  The man crams six months' work into six\nweeks; then he is off again.\"\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"What CAN I do?  I know that Fu-Manchu will make an attempt upon him.\nI cannot doubt it.  Ugh!  that house gave me the shudders.  No\nsunlight, I'll swear, Petrie, can ever penetrate to the rooms, and when\nI arrived this afternoon clouds of gnats floated like motes wherever a\nstray beam filtered through the trees of the avenue.  There's a steamy\nsmell about the place that is almost malarious, and the whole of the\nwest front is covered with a sort of monkey-creeper, which he has\nimported at some time or other.  It has a close, exotic perfume that is\nquite in the picture.  I tell you, the place was made for murder.\"\n\n\"Have you taken any precautions?\"\n\n\"I called at Scotland Yard and sent a man down to watch the house,\nbut--\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders helplessly.\n\n\"What is Sir Lionel like?\"\n\n\"A madman, Petrie.  A tall, massive man, wearing a dirty dressing-gown\nof neutral color; a man with untidy gray hair and a bristling mustache,\nkeen blue eyes, and a brown skin; who wears a short beard or rarely\nshaves--I don't know which.  I left him striding about among the\nthousand and one curiosities of that incredible room, picking his way\nthrough his antique furniture, works of reference, manuscripts,\nmummies, spears, pottery and what not--sometimes kicking a book from\nhis course, or stumbling over a stuffed crocodile or a Mexican\nmask--alternately dictating and conversing.  Phew!\"\n\nFor some time we were silent.\n\n\"Smith\" I said, \"we are making no headway in this business.  With all\nthe forces arrayed against him, Fu-Manchu still eludes us, still\npursues his devilish, inscrutable way.\"\n\nNayland Smith nodded.\n\n\"And we don't know all,\" he said.  \"We mark such and such a man as one\nalive to the Yellow Peril, and we warn him--if we have time.  Perhaps\nhe escapes; perhaps he does not.  But what do we know, Petrie, of those\nothers who may die every week by his murderous agency?  We cannot know\nEVERYONE who has read the riddle of China.  I never see a report of\nsomeone found drowned, of an apparent suicide, of a sudden, though\nseemingly natural death, without wondering.  I tell you, Fu-Manchu is\nomnipresent; his tentacles embrace everything.  I said that Sir Lionel\nmust bear a charmed life.  The fact that WE are alive is a miracle.\"\n\nHe glanced at his watch.\n\n\"Nearly eleven,\" he said.  \"But sleep seems a waste of time--apart from\nits dangers.\"\n\nWe heard a bell ring.  A few moments later followed a knock at the room\ndoor.\n\n\"Come in!\" I cried.\n\nA girl entered with a telegram addressed to Smith.  His jaw looked very\nsquare in the lamplight, and his eyes shone like steel as he took it\nfrom her and opened the envelope.  He glanced at the form, stood up and\npassed it to me, reaching for his hat, which lay upon my writing-table.\n\n\"God help us, Petrie!\" he said.\n\nThis was the message:\n\n\n\"Sir Lionel Barton murdered.  Meet me at his house at once.--WEYMOUTH,\nINSPECTOR.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nALTHOUGH we avoided all unnecessary delay, it was close upon midnight\nwhen our cab swung round into a darkly shadowed avenue, at the farther\nend of which, as seen through a tunnel, the moonlight glittered upon\nthe windows of Rowan House, Sir Lionel Barton's home.\n\nStepping out before the porch of the long, squat building, I saw that\nit was banked in, as Smith had said, by trees and shrubs.  The facade\nshowed mantled in the strange exotic creeper which he had mentioned,\nand the air was pungent with an odor of decaying vegetation, with which\nmingled the heavy perfume of the little nocturnal red flowers which\nbloomed luxuriantly upon the creeper.\n\nThe place looked a veritable wilderness, and when we were admitted to\nthe hall by Inspector Weymouth I saw that the interior was in keeping\nwith the exterior, for the hall was constructed from the model of some\napartment in an Assyrian temple, and the squat columns, the low seats,\nthe hangings, all were eloquent of neglect, being thickly dust-coated.\nThe musty smell, too, was almost as pronounced here as outside, beneath\nthe trees.\n\nTo a library, whose contents overflowed in many literary torrents upon\nthe floor, the detective conducted us.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried, \"what's that?\"\n\nSomething leaped from the top of the bookcase, ambled silently across\nthe littered carpet, and passed from the library like a golden streak.\nI stood looking after it with startled eyes.  Inspector Weymouth\nlaughed dryly.\n\n\"It's a young puma, or a civet-cat, or something, Doctor,\" he said.\n\"This house is full of surprises--and mysteries.\"\n\nHis voice was not quite steady, I thought, and he carefully closed the\ndoor ere proceeding further.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Nayland Smith harshly.  \"How was it done?\"\n\nWeymouth sat down and lighted a cigar which I offered him.\n\n\"I thought you would like to hear what led up to it--so far as we\nknow--before seeing him?\"\n\nSmith nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" continued the Inspector, \"the man you arranged to send down\nfrom the Yard got here all right and took up a post in the road\noutside, where he could command a good view of the gates.  He saw and\nheard nothing, until going on for half-past ten, when a young lady\nturned up and went in.\"\n\n\"A young lady?\"\n\n\"Miss Edmonds, Sir Lionel's shorthand typist.  She had found, after\ngetting home, that her bag, with her purse in, was missing, and she\ncame back to see if she had left it here.  She gave the alarm.  My man\nheard the row from the road and came in.  Then he ran out and rang us\nup.  I immediately wired for you.\"\n\n\"He heard the row, you say.  What row?\"\n\n\"Miss Edmonds went into violent hysterics!\"\n\nSmith was pacing the room now in tense excitement.\n\n\"Describe what he saw when he came in.\"\n\n\"He saw a negro footman--there isn't an Englishman in the house--trying\nto pacify the girl out in the hall yonder, and a Malay and another\ncolored man beating their foreheads and howling.  There was no sense to\nbe got out of any of them, so he started to investigate for himself.\nHe had taken the bearings of the place earlier in the evening, and from\nthe light in a window on the ground floor had located the study; so he\nset out to look for the door.  When he found it, it was locked from the\ninside.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He went out and round to the window.  There's no blind, and from the\nshrubbery you can see into the lumber-room known as the study.  He\nlooked in, as apparently Miss Edmonds had done before him.  What he saw\naccounted for her hysterics.\"\n\nBoth Smith and I were hanging upon his words.\n\n\"All amongst the rubbish on the floor a big Egyptian mummy case was\nlying on its side, and face downwards, with his arms thrown across it,\nlay Sir Lionel Barton.\"\n\n\"My God!  Yes.  Go on.\"\n\n\"There was only a shaded reading-lamp alight, and it stood on a chair,\nshining right down on him; it made a patch of light on the floor, you\nunderstand.\"  The Inspector indicated its extent with his hands.\n\"Well, as the man smashed the glass and got the window open, and was\njust climbing in, he saw something else, so he says.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"What did he see?\" demanded Smith shortly.\n\n\"A sort of GREEN MIST, sir.  He says it seemed to be alive.  It moved\nover the floor, about a foot from the ground, going away from him and\ntowards a curtain at the other end of the study.\"\n\nNayland Smith fixed his eyes upon the speaker.\n\n\"Where did he first see this green mist?\"\n\n\"He says, Mr. Smith, that he thinks it came from the mummy case.\"\n\n\"Yes; go on.\"\n\n\"It is to his credit that he climbed into the room after seeing a thing\nlike that.  He did.  He turned the body over, and Sir Lionel looked\nhorrible.  He was quite dead.  Then Croxted--that's the man's\nname--went over to this curtain.  There was a glass door--shut.  He\nopened it, and it gave on a conservatory--a place stacked from the\ntiled floor to the glass roof with more rubbish.  It was dark inside,\nbut enough light came from the study--it's really a drawing-room, by\nthe way--as he'd turned all the lamps on, to give him another glimpse\nof this green, crawling mist.  There are three steps to go down.  On\nthe steps lay a dead Chinaman.\"\n\n\"A dead Chinaman!\"\n\n\"A dead CHINAMAN.\"\n\n\"Doctor seen them?\" rapped Smith.\n\n\"Yes; a local man.  He was out of his depth, I could see.  Contradicted\nhimself three times.  But there's no need for another opinion--until we\nget the coroner's.\"\n\n\"And Croxted?\"\n\n\"Croxted was taken ill, Mr. Smith, and had to be sent home in a cab.\"\n\n\"What ails him?\"\n\nDetective-Inspector Weymouth raised his eyebrows and carefully knocked\nthe ash from his cigar.\n\n\"He held out until I came, gave me the story, and then fainted right\naway.  He said that something in the conservatory seemed to get him by\nthe throat.\"\n\n\"Did he mean that literally?\"\n\n\"I couldn't say.  We had to send the girl home, too, of course.\"\n\nNayland Smith was pulling thoughtfully at the lobe of his left ear.\n\n\"Got any theory?\" he jerked.\n\nWeymouth shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Not one that includes the green mist,\" he said.  \"Shall we go in now?\"\n\nWe crossed the Assyrian hall, where the members of that strange\nhousehold were gathered in a panic-stricken group.  They numbered four.\nTwo of them were negroes, and two Easterns of some kind.  I missed the\nChinaman, Kwee, of whom Smith had spoken, and the Italian secretary;\nand from the way in which my friend peered about the shadows of the\nhall I divined that he, too, wondered at their absence.  We entered Sir\nLionel's study--an apartment which I despair of describing.\n\nNayland Smith's words, \"an earthquake at Sotheby's auction-rooms,\"\nleaped to my mind at once; for the place was simply stacked with\ncurious litter--loot of Africa, Mexico and Persia.  In a clearing by\nthe hearth a gas stove stood upon a packing-case, and about it lay a\nnumber of utensils for camp cookery.  The odor of rotting vegetation,\nmingled with the insistent perfume of the strange night-blooming\nflowers, was borne in through the open window.\n\nIn the center of the floor, beside an overturned sarcophagus, lay a\nfigure in a neutral-colored dressing-gown, face downwards, and arms\nthrust forward and over the side of the ancient Egyptian mummy case.\n\nMy friend advanced and knelt beside the dead man.\n\n\"Good God!\"\n\nSmith sprang upright and turned with an extraordinary expression to\nInspector Weymouth.\n\n\"You do not know Sir Lionel Barton by sight?\" he rapped.\n\n\"No,\" began Weymouth, \"but--\"\n\n\"This is not Sir Lionel.  This is Strozza, the secretary.\"\n\n\"What!\" shouted Weymouth.\n\n\"Where is the other--the Chinaman--quick!\" cried Smith.\n\n\"I have had him left where he was found--on the conservatory steps,\"\nsaid the Inspector.\n\nSmith ran across the room to where, beyond the open door, a glimpse\nmight be obtained of stacked-up curiosities.  Holding back the curtain\nto allow more light to penetrate, he bent forward over a crumpled-up\nfigure which lay upon the steps below.\n\n\"It is!\" he cried aloud.  \"It is Sir Lionel's servant, Kwee.\"\n\nWeymouth and I looked at one another across the body of the Italian;\nthen our eyes turned together to where my friend, grim-faced, stood\nover the dead Chinaman.  A breeze whispered through the leaves; a great\nwave of exotic perfume swept from the open window towards the curtained\ndoorway.\n\nIt was a breath of the East--that stretched out a yellow hand to the\nWest.  It was symbolic of the subtle, intangible power manifested in\nDr. Fu-Manchu, as Nayland Smith--lean, agile, bronzed with the suns of\nBurma, was symbolic of the clean British efficiency which sought to\ncombat the insidious enemy.\n\n\"One thing is evident,\" said Smith:  \"no one in the house, Strozza\nexcepted, knew that Sir Lionel was absent.\"\n\n\"How do you arrive at that?\" asked Weymouth.\n\n\"The servants, in the hall, are bewailing him as dead.  If they had\nseen him go out they would know that it must be someone else who lies\nhere.\"\n\n\"What about the Chinaman?\"\n\n\"Since there is no other means of entrance to the conservatory save\nthrough the study, Kwee must have hidden himself there at some time\nwhen his master was absent from the room.\"\n\n\"Croxted found the communicating door closed.  What killed the\nChinaman?\"\n\n\"Both Miss Edmonds and Croxted found the study door locked from the\ninside.  What killed Strozza?\" retorted Smith.\n\n\"You will have noted,\" continued the Inspector, \"that the secretary is\nwearing Sir Lionel's dressing-gown. It was seeing him in that, as she\nlooked in at the window, which led Miss Edmonds to mistake him for her\nemployer--and consequently to put us on the wrong scent.\"\n\n\"He wore it in order that anybody looking in at the window would be\nsure to make that mistake,\" rapped Smith.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because he came here for a felonious purpose.  See.\"  Smith stooped\nand took up several tools from the litter on the floor.  \"There lies\nthe lid.  He came to open the sarcophagus.  It contained the mummy of\nsome notable person who flourished under Meneptah II; and Sir Lionel\ntold me that a number of valuable ornaments and jewels probably were\nsecreted amongst the wrappings.  He proposed to open the thing and to\nsubmit the entire contents to examination to-night. He evidently\nchanged his mind--fortunately for himself.\"\n\nI ran my fingers through my hair in perplexity.\n\n\"Then what has become of the mummy?\"\n\nNayland Smith laughed dryly.\n\n\"It has vanished in the form of a green vapor apparently,\" he said.\n\"Look at Strozza's face.\"\n\nHe turned the body over, and, used as I was to such spectacles, the\ncontorted features of the Italian filled me with horror, so--suggestive\nwere they of a death more than ordinarily violent.  I pulled aside the\ndressing-gown and searched the body for marks, but failed to find any.\nNayland Smith crossed the room, and, assisted by the detective, carried\nKwee, the Chinaman, into the study and laid him fully in the light.\nHis puckered yellow face presented a sight even more awful than the\nother, and his blue lips were drawn back, exposing both upper and lower\nteeth.  There were no marks of violence, but his limbs, like Strozza's,\nhad been tortured during his mortal struggles into unnatural postures.\n\nThe breeze was growing higher, and pungent odor-waves from the damp\nshrubbery, bearing, too, the oppressive sweetness of the creeping\nplant, swept constantly through the open window.  Inspector Weymouth\ncarefully relighted his cigar.\n\n\"I'm with you this far, Mr. Smith,\" he said.  \"Strozza, knowing Sir\nLionel to be absent, locked himself in here to rifle the mummy case,\nfor Croxted, entering by way of the window, found the key on the\ninside.  Strozza didn't know that the Chinaman was hidden in the\nconservatory--\"\n\n\"And Kwee did not dare to show himself, because he too was there for\nsome mysterious reason of his own,\" interrupted Smith.\n\n\"Having got the lid off, something,--somebody--\"\n\n\"Suppose we say the mummy?\"\n\nWeymouth laughed uneasily.\n\n\"Well, sir, something that vanished from a locked room without opening\nthe door or the window killed Strozza.\"\n\n\"And something which, having killed Strozza, next killed the Chinaman,\napparently without troubling to open the door behind which he lay\nconcealed,\" Smith continued.  \"For once in a way, Inspector, Dr.\nFu-Manchu has employed an ally which even his giant will was incapable\nentirely to subjugate.  What blind force--what terrific agent of\ndeath--had he confined in that sarcophagus!\"\n\n\"You think this is the work of Fu-Manchu?\" I said.  \"If you are\ncorrect, his power indeed is more than human.\"\n\nSomething in my voice, I suppose, brought Smith right about.  He\nsurveyed me curiously.\n\n\"Can you doubt it?  The presence of a concealed Chinaman surely is\nsufficient.  Kwee, I feel assured, was one of the murder group, though\nprobably he had only recently entered that mysterious service.  He is\nunarmed, or I should feel disposed to think that his part was to\nassassinate Sir Lionel whilst, unsuspecting the presence of a hidden\nenemy, he was at work here.  Strozza's opening the sarcophagus clearly\nspoiled the scheme.\"\n\n\"And led to the death--\"\n\n\"Of a servant of Fu-Manchu. Yes.  I am at a loss to account for that.\"\n\n\"Do you think that the sarcophagus entered into the scheme, Smith?\"\n\nMy friend looked at me in evident perplexity.\n\n\"You mean that its arrival at the time when a creature of the\nDoctor--Kwee--was concealed here, may have been a coincidence?\"\n\nI nodded; and Smith bent over the sarcophagus, curiously examining the\ngarish paintings with which it was decorated inside and out.  It lay\nsideways upon the floor, and seizing it by its edge, he turned it over.\n\n\"Heavy,\" he muttered; \"but Strozza must have capsized it as he fell.\nHe would not have laid it on its side to remove the lid.  Hallo!\"\n\nHe bent farther forward, catching at a piece of twine, and out of the\nmummy case pulled a rubber stopper or \"cork.\"\n\n\"This was stuck in a hole level with the floor of the thing,\" he said.\n\"Ugh!  it has a disgusting smell.\"\n\nI took it from his hands, and was about to examine it, when a loud\nvoice sounded outside in the hall.  The door was thrown open, and a big\nman, who, despite the warmth of the weather, wore a fur-lined overcoat,\nrushed impetuously into the room.\n\n\"Sir Lionel!\" cried Smith eagerly.  \"I warned you!  And see, you have\nhad a very narrow escape.\"\n\nSir Lionel Barton glanced at what lay upon the floor, then from Smith\nto myself, and from me to Inspector Weymouth.  He dropped into one of\nthe few chairs unstacked with books.\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" he said, with emotion, \"what does this mean?  Tell\nme--quickly.\"\n\nIn brief terms Smith detailed the happenings of the night--or so much\nas he knew of them.  Sir Lionel Barton listened, sitting quite still\nthe while--an unusual repose in a man of such evidently tremendous\nnervous activity.\n\n\"He came for the jewels,\" he said slowly, when Smith was finished; and\nhis eyes turned to the body of the dead Italian.  \"I was wrong to\nsubmit him to the temptation.  God knows what Kwee was doing in hiding.\nPerhaps he had come to murder me, as you surmise, Mr. Smith, though I\nfind it hard to believe.  But--I don't think this is the handiwork of\nyour Chinese doctor.\" He fixed his gaze upon the sarcophagus.\n\nSmith stared at him in surprise.  \"What do you mean, Sir Lionel?\"\n\nThe famous traveler continued to look towards the sarcophagus with\nsomething in his blue eyes that might have been dread.\n\n\"I received a wire from Professor Rembold to-night,\" he continued.\n\"You were correct in supposing that no one but Strozza knew of my\nabsence.  I dressed hurriedly and met the professor at the Traveler's.\nHe knew that I was to read a paper next week upon\"--again he looked\ntoward the mummy case--\"the tomb of Mekara; and he knew that the\nsarcophagus had been brought, untouched, to England.  He begged me not\nto open it.\"\n\nNayland Smith was studying the speaker's face.\n\n\"What reason did he give for so extraordinary a request?\" he asked.\n\nSir Lionel Barton hesitated.\n\n\"One,\" he replied at last, \"which amused me--at the time.  I must\ninform you that Mekara--whose tomb my agent had discovered during my\nabsence in Tibet, and to enter which I broke my return journey to\nAlexandria--was a high priest and first prophet of Amen--under the\nPharaoh of the Exodus; in short, one of the magicians who contested in\nmagic arts with Moses.  I thought the discovery unique, until Professor\nRembold furnished me with some curious particulars respecting the death\nof M. Page le Roi, the French Egyptologist--particulars new to me.\"\n\nWe listened in growing surprise, scarcely knowing to what this tended.\n\n\"M. le Roi,\" continued Barton, \"discovered, but kept secret, the tomb\nof Amenti--another of this particular brotherhood.  It appears that he\nopened the mummy case on the spot--these priests were of royal line,\nand are buried in the valley of Biban-le-Moluk. His Fellah and Arab\nservants deserted him for some reason--on seeing the mummy case--and he\nwas found dead, apparently strangled, beside it.  The matter was hushed\nup by the Egyptian Government.  Rembold could not explain why.  But he\nbegged of me not to open the sarcophagus of Mekara.\"\n\nA silence fell.\n\nThe strange facts regarding the sudden death of Page le Roi, which I\nnow heard for the first time, had impressed me unpleasantly, coming\nfrom a man of Sir Lionel Barton's experience and reputation.\n\n\"How long had it lain in the docks?\" jerked Smith.\n\n\"For two days, I believe.  I am not a superstitious man, Mr. Smith, but\nneither is Professor Rembold, and now that I know the facts respecting\nPage le Roi, I can find it in my heart to thank God that I did not\nsee . . . whatever came out of that sarcophagus.\"\n\nNayland Smith stared him hard in the face.  \"I am glad you did not, Sir\nLionel,\" he said; \"for whatever the priest Mekara has to do with the\nmatter, by means of his sarcophagus, Dr. Fu-Manchu has made his first\nattempt upon your life.  He has failed, but I hope you will accompany\nme from here to a hotel.  He will not fail twice.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nIT was the night following that of the double tragedy at Rowan House.\nNayland Smith, with Inspector Weymouth, was engaged in some mysterious\ninquiry at the docks, and I had remained at home to resume my strange\nchronicle.  And--why should I not confess it?--my memories had\nfrightened me.\n\nI was arranging my notes respecting the case of Sir Lionel Barton.\nThey were hopelessly incomplete.  For instance, I had jotted down the\nfollowing queries:--(1) Did any true parallel exist between the death\nof M. Page le Roi and the death of Kwee, the Chinaman, and of Strozza?\n(2) What had become of the mummy of Mekara?  (3) How had the murderer\nescaped from a locked room?  (4) What was the purpose of the rubber\nstopper?  (5) Why was Kwee hiding in the conservatory?  (6) Was the\ngreen mist a mere subjective hallucination--a figment of Croxted's\nimagination--or had he actually seen it?\n\nUntil these questions were satisfactorily answered, further progress\nwas impossible.  Nayland Smith frankly admitted that he was out of his\ndepth.  \"It looks, on the face of it, more like a case for the\nPsychical Research people than for a plain Civil Servant, lately of\nMandalay,\" he had said only that morning.\n\n\"Sir Lionel Barton really believes that supernatural agencies were\nbrought into operation by the opening of the high priest's coffin.  For\nmy part, even if I believed the same, I should still maintain that Dr.\nFu-Manchu controlled those manifestations.  But reason it out for\nyourself and see if we arrive at any common center.  Don't work so much\nupon the datum of the green mist, but keep to the FACTS which are\nestablished.\"\n\nI commenced to knock out my pipe in the ash-tray; then paused, pipe in\nhand.  The house was quite still, for my landlady and all the small\nhousehold were out.\n\nAbove the noise of the passing tramcar I thought I had heard the hall\ndoor open.  In the ensuing silence I sat and listened.\n\nNot a sound.  Stay!  I slipped my hand into the table drawer, took out\nmy revolver, and stood up.\n\nThere WAS a sound.  Someone or something was creeping upstairs in the\ndark!\n\nFamiliar with the ghastly media employed by the Chinaman, I was seized\nwith an impulse to leap to the door, shut and lock it.  But the\nrustling sound proceeded, now, from immediately outside my partially\nopened door.  I had not the time to close it; knowing somewhat of the\nhorrors at the command of Fu-Manchu, I had not the courage to open it.\nMy heart leaping wildly, and my eyes upon that bar of darkness with its\ngruesome potentialities, I waited--waited for whatever was to come.\nPerhaps twelve seconds passed in silence.\n\n\"Who's there?\" I cried.  \"Answer, or I fire!\"\n\n\"Ah!  no,\" came a soft voice, thrillingly musical.  \"Put it down--that\npistol.  Quick!  I must speak to you.\"\n\nThe door was pushed open, and there entered a slim figure wrapped in a\nhooded cloak.  My hand fell, and I stood, stricken to silence, looking\ninto the beautiful dark eyes of Dr. Fu-Manchu's messenger--if her own\nstatement could be credited, slave.  On two occasions this girl, whose\nassociation with the Doctor was one of the most profound mysteries of\nthe case, had risked--I cannot say what; unnameable punishment,\nperhaps--to save me from death; in both cases from a terrible death.\nFor what was she come now?\n\nHer lips slightly parted, she stood, holding her cloak about her, and\nwatching me with great passionate eyes.\n\n\"How--\" I began.\n\nBut she shook her head impatiently.\n\n\"HE has a duplicate key of the house door,\" was her amazing statement.\n\"I have never betrayed a secret of my master before, but you must\narrange to replace the lock.\"\n\nShe came forward and rested her slim hands confidingly upon my\nshoulders.  \"I have come again to ask you to take me away from him,\"\nshe said simply.\n\nAnd she lifted her face to me.\n\nHer words struck a chord in my heart which sang with strange music,\nwith music so barbaric that, frankly, I blushed to find it harmony.\nHave I said that she was beautiful?  It can convey no faint conception\nof her.  With her pure, fair skin, eyes like the velvet darkness of the\nEast, and red lips so tremulously near to mine, she was the most\nseductively lovely creature I ever had looked upon.  In that electric\nmoment my heart went out in sympathy to every man who had bartered\nhonor, country, all for a woman's kiss.\n\n\"I will see that you are placed under proper protection,\" I said\nfirmly, but my voice was not quite my own.  \"It is quite absurd to talk\nof slavery here in England.  You are a free agent, or you could not be\nhere now.  Dr. Fu-Manchu cannot control your actions.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she cried, casting back her head scornfully, and releasing a\ncloud of hair, through whose softness gleamed a jeweled head-dress.\n\"No?  He cannot?  Do you know what it means to have been a slave?\nHere, in your free England, do you know what it means--the razzia, the\ndesert journey, the whips of the drivers, the house of the dealer, the\nshame.  Bah!\"\n\nHow beautiful she was in her indignation!\n\n\"Slavery is put down, you imagine, perhaps?  You do not believe that\nto-day--TO-DAY--twenty-five English sovereigns will buy a Galla girl,\nwho is brown, and\"--whisper--\"two hundred and fifty a Circassian, who\nis white.  No, there is no slavery!  So!  Then what am I?\"\n\nShe threw open her cloak, and it is a literal fact that I rubbed my\neyes, half believing that I dreamed.  For beneath, she was arrayed in\ngossamer silk which more than indicated the perfect lines of her slim\nshape; wore a jeweled girdle and barbaric ornaments; was a figure fit\nfor the walled gardens of Stamboul--a figure amazing, incomprehensible,\nin the prosaic setting of my rooms.\n\n\"To-night I had no time to make myself an English miss,\" she said,\nwrapping her cloak quickly about her.  \"You see me as I am.\"  Her\ngarments exhaled a faint perfume, and it reminded me of another meeting\nI had had with her.  I looked into the challenging eyes.\n\n\"Your request is but a pretense,\" I said.  \"Why do you keep the secrets\nof that man, when they mean death to so many?\"\n\n\"Death!  I have seen my own sister die of fever in the desert--seen her\nthrown like carrion into a hole in the sand.  I have seen men flogged\nuntil they prayed for death as a boon.  I have known the lash myself.\nDeath!  What does it matter?\"\n\nShe shocked me inexpressibly.  Enveloped in her cloak again, and with\nonly her slight accent to betray her, it was dreadful to hear such\nwords from a girl who, save for her singular type of beauty, might have\nbeen a cultured European.\n\n\"Prove, then, that you really wish to leave this man's service.  Tell\nme what killed Strozza and the Chinaman,\" I said.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"I do not know that.  But if you will carry me off\"--she clutched me\nnervously--\"so that I am helpless, lock me up so that I cannot escape,\nbeat me, if you like, I will tell you all I do know.  While he is my\nmaster I will never betray him.  Tear me from him--by force, do you\nunderstand, BY FORCE, and my lips will be sealed no longer.  Ah!  but\nyou do not understand, with your 'proper authorities'--your police.\nPolice!  Ah, I have said enough.\"\n\nA clock across the common began to strike.  The girl started and laid\nher hands upon my shoulders again.  There were tears glittering among\nthe curved black lashes.\n\n\"You do not understand,\" she whispered.  \"Oh, will you never understand\nand release me from him!  I must go.  Already I have remained too long.\nListen.  Go out without delay.  Remain out--at a hotel, where you will,\nbut do not stay here.\"\n\n\"And Nayland Smith?\"\n\n\"What is he to me, this Nayland Smith?  Ah, why will you not unseal my\nlips?  You are in danger--you hear me, in danger!  Go away from here\nto-night.\"\n\nShe dropped her hands and ran from the room.  In the open doorway she\nturned, stamping her foot passionately.\n\n\"You have hands and arms,\" she cried, \"and yet you let me go.  Be\nwarned, then; fly from here--\" She broke off with something that\nsounded like a sob.\n\nI made no move to stay her--this beautiful accomplice of the\narch-murderer, Fu-Manchu. I heard her light footsteps pattering down\nthe stairs, I heard her open and close the door--the door of which Dr.\nFu-Manchu held the key.  Still I stood where she had parted from me,\nand was so standing when a key grated in the lock and Nayland Smith\ncame running up.\n\n\"Did you see her?\" I began.\n\nBut his face showed that he had not done so, and rapidly I told him of\nmy strange visitor, of her words, of her warning.\n\n\"How can she have passed through London in that costume?\" I cried in\nbewilderment.  \"Where can she have come from?\"\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders and began to stuff broad-cut mixture into\nthe familiar cracked briar.\n\n\"She might have traveled in a car or in a cab,\" he said; \"and\nundoubtedly she came direct from the house of Dr. Fu-Manchu.  You\nshould have detained her, Petrie.  It is the third time we have had\nthat woman in our power, the third time we have let her go free.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I replied, \"I couldn't. She came of her own free will to give\nme a warning.  She disarms me.\"\n\n\"Because you can see she is in love with you?\" he suggested, and burst\ninto one of his rare laughs when the angry flush rose to my cheek.\n\"She is, Petrie why pretend to be blind to it?  You don't know the\nOriental mind as I do; but I quite understand the girl's position.  She\nfears the English authorities, but would submit to capture by you!  If\nyou would only seize her by the hair, drag her to some cellar, hurl her\ndown and stand over her with a whip, she would tell you everything she\nknows, and salve her strange Eastern conscience with the reflection\nthat speech was forced from her.  I am not joking; it is so, I assure\nyou.  And she would adore you for your savagery, deeming you forceful\nand strong!\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, \"be serious.  You know what her warning meant before.\"\n\n\"I can guess what it means now,\" he rapped.  \"Hallo!\"\n\nSomeone was furiously ringing the bell.\n\n\"No one at home?\" said my friend.  \"I will go.  I think I know what it\nis.\"\n\nA few minutes later he returned, carrying a large square package.\n\n\"From Weymouth,\" he explained, \"by district messenger.  I left him\nbehind at the docks, and he arranged to forward any evidence which\nsubsequently he found.  This will be fragments of the mummy.\"\n\n\"What!  You think the mummy was abstracted?\"\n\n\"Yes, at the docks.  I am sure of it; and somebody else was in the\nsarcophagus when it reached Rowan House.  A sarcophagus, I find, is\npractically airtight, so that the use of the rubber stopper becomes\nevident--ventilation.  How this person killed Strozza I have yet to\nlearn.\"\n\n\"Also, how he escaped from a locked room.  And what about the green\nmist?\"\n\nNayland Smith spread his hands in a characteristic gesture.\n\n\"The green mist, Petrie, can be explained in several ways.  Remember,\nwe have only one man's word that it existed.  It is at best a confusing\ndatum to which we must not attach a factitious importance.\"\n\nHe threw the wrappings on the floor and tugged at a twine loop in the\nlid of the square box, which now stood upon the table.  Suddenly the\nlid came away, bringing with it a lead lining, such as is usual in\ntea-chests. This lining was partially attached to one side of the box,\nso that the action of removing the lid at once raised and tilted it.\n\nThen happened a singular thing.\n\nOut over the table billowed a sort of yellowish-green cloud--an oily\nvapor--and an inspiration, it was nothing less, born of a memory and of\nsome words of my beautiful visitor, came to me.\n\n\"RUN, SMITH!\" I screamed.  \"The door! the door, for your life!\nFu-Manchu sent that box!\"  I threw my arms round him.  As he bent\nforward the moving vapor rose almost to his nostrils.  I dragged him\nback and all but pitched him out on to the landing.  We entered my\nbedroom, and there, as I turned on the light, I saw that Smith's tanned\nface was unusually drawn, and touched with pallor.\n\n\"It is a poisonous gas!\" I said hoarsely; \"in many respects identical\nwith chlorine, but having unique properties which prove it to be\nsomething else--God and Fu-Manchu, alone know what!  It is the fumes of\nchlorine that kill the men in the bleaching powder works.  We have been\nblind--I particularly.  Don't you see?  There was no one in the\nsarcophagus, Smith, but there was enough of that fearful stuff to have\nsuffocated a regiment!\"\n\nSmith clenched his fists convulsively.\n\n\"My God!\" he said, \"how can I hope to deal with the author of such a\nscheme?  I see the whole plan.  He did not reckon on the mummy case\nbeing overturned, and Kwee's part was to remove the plug with the aid\nof the string--after Sir Lionel had been suffocated.  The gas, I take\nit, is heavier than air.\"\n\n\"Chlorine gas has a specific gravity of 2.470,\" I said; \"two and a half\ntimes heavier than air.  You can pour it from jar to jar like a\nliquid--if you are wearing a chemist's mask.  In these respects this\nstuff appears to be similar; the points of difference would not\ninterest you.  The sarcophagus would have emptied through the vent, and\nthe gas have dispersed, with no clew remaining--except the smell.\"\n\n\"I did smell it, Petrie, on the stopper, but, of course, was unfamiliar\nwith it.  You may remember that you were prevented from doing so by the\narrival of Sir Lionel?  The scent of those infernal flowers must\npartially have drowned it, too.  Poor, misguided Strozza inhaled the\nstuff, capsized the case in his fall, and all the gas--\"\n\n\"Went pouring under the conservatory door, and down the steps, where\nKwee was crouching.  Croxted's breaking the window created sufficient\ndraught to disperse what little remained.  It will have settled on the\nfloor now.  I will go and open both windows.\"\n\nNayland raised his haggard face.\n\n\"He evidently made more than was necessary to dispatch Sir Lionel\nBarton,\" he said; \"and contemptuously--you note the attitude,\nPetrie?--contemptuously devoted the surplus to me.  His contempt is\njustified.  I am a child striving to cope with a mental giant.  It is\nby no wit of mine that Dr. Fu-Manchu scores a double failure.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nI WILL tell you, now of a strange dream which I dreamed, and of the\nstranger things to which I awakened.  Since, out of a blank--a\nvoid--this vision burst in upon my mind, I cannot do better than relate\nit, without preamble.  It was thus:\n\nI dreamed that I lay writhing on the floor in agony indescribable.  My\nveins were filled with liquid fire, and but that stygian darkness was\nabout me, I told myself that I must have seen the smoke arising from my\nburning body.\n\nThis, I thought, was death.\n\nThen, a cooling shower descended upon me, soaked through skin and\ntissue to the tortured arteries and quenched the fire within.  Panting,\nbut free from pain, I lay--exhausted.\n\nStrength gradually returning to me, I tried to rise; but the carpet\nfelt so singularly soft that it offered me no foothold.  I waded and\nplunged like a swimmer treading water; and all about me rose\nimpenetrable walls of darkness, darkness all but palpable.  I wondered\nwhy I could not see the windows.  The horrible idea flashed to my mind\nthat I was become blind!\n\nSomehow I got upon my feet, and stood swaying dizzily.  I became aware\nof a heavy perfume, and knew it for some kind of incense.\n\nThen--a dim light was born, at an immeasurable distance away.  It grew\nsteadily in brilliance.  It spread like a bluish-red stain--like a\nliquid.  It lapped up the darkness and spread throughout the room.\n\nBut this was not my room!  Nor was it any room known to me.\n\nIt was an apartment of such size that its dimensions filled me with a\nkind of awe such as I never had known:  the awe of walled vastness.\nIts immense extent produced a sensation of sound.  Its hugeness had a\ndistinct NOTE.\n\nTapestries covered the four walls.  There was no door visible.  These\ntapestries were magnificently figured with golden dragons; and as the\nserpentine bodies gleamed and shimmered in the increasing radiance,\neach dragon, I thought, intertwined its glittering coils more closely\nwith those of another.  The carpet was of such richness that I stood\nknee-deep in its pile.  And this, too, was fashioned all over with\ngolden dragons; and they seemed to glide about amid the shadows of the\ndesign--stealthily.\n\nAt the farther end of the hall--for hall it was--a huge table with\ndragons' legs stood solitary amid the luxuriance of the carpet.  It\nbore scintillating globes, and tubes that held living organisms, and\nbooks of a size and in such bindings as I never had imagined, with\ninstruments of a type unknown to Western science--a heterogeneous\nlitter quite indescribable, which overflowed on to the floor, forming\nan amazing oasis in a dragon-haunted desert of carpet.  A lamp hung\nabove this table, suspended by golden chains from the ceiling--which\nwas so lofty that, following the chains upward, my gaze lost itself in\nthe purple shadows above.\n\nIn a chair piled high with dragon-covered cushions a man sat behind\nthis table.  The light from the swinging lamp fell fully upon one side\nof his face, as he leaned forward amid the jumble of weird objects, and\nleft the other side in purplish shadow.  From a plain brass bowl upon\nthe corner of the huge table smoke writhed aloft and at times partially\nobscured that dreadful face.\n\nFrom the instant that my eyes were drawn to the table and to the man\nwho sat there, neither the incredible extent of the room, nor the\nnightmare fashion of its mural decorations, could reclaim my attention.\nI had eyes only for him.\n\nFor it was Dr. Fu-Manchu!\n\nSomething of the delirium which had seemed to fill my veins with fire,\nto people the walls with dragons, and to plunge me knee-deep in the\ncarpet, left me.  Those dreadful, filmed green eyes acted somewhat like\na cold douche.  I knew, without removing my gaze from the still face,\nthat the walls no longer lived, but were merely draped in exquisite\nChinese dragon tapestry.  The rich carpet beneath my feet ceased to be\nas a jungle and became a normal carpet--extraordinarily rich, but\nmerely a carpet.  But the sense of vastness nevertheless remained, with\nthe uncomfortable knowledge that the things upon the table and\noverflowing about it were all, or nearly all, of a fashion strange to\nme.\n\nThen, and almost instantaneously, the comparative sanity which I had\ntemporarily experienced began to slip from me again; for the smoke\nfaintly penciled through the air--from the burning perfume on the\ntable--grew in volume, thickened, and wafted towards me in a cloud of\ngray horror.  It enveloped me, clammily.  Dimly, through its oily\nwreaths, I saw the immobile yellow face of Fu-Manchu. And my stupefied\nbrain acclaimed him a sorcerer, against whom unwittingly we had pitted\nour poor human wits.  The green eyes showed filmy through the fog.  An\nintense pain shot through my lower limbs, and, catching my breath, I\nlooked down.  As I did so, the points of the red slippers which I\ndreamed that I wore increased in length, curled sinuously upward,\ntwined about my throat and choked the breath from my body!\n\nCame an interval, and then a dawning like consciousness; but it was a\nfalse consciousness, since it brought with it the idea that my head lay\nsoftly pillowed and that a woman's hand caressed my throbbing forehead.\nConfusedly, as though in the remote past, I recalled a kiss--and the\nrecollection thrilled me strangely.  Dreamily content I lay, and a\nvoice stole to my ears:\n\n\"They are killing him!  they are killing him!  Oh!  do you not\nunderstand?\" In my dazed condition, I thought that it was I who had\ndied, and that this musical girl-voice was communicating to me the fact\nof my own dissolution.\n\nBut I was conscious of no interest in the matter.\n\nFor hours and hours, I thought, that soothing hand caressed me.  I\nnever once raised my heavy lids, until there came a resounding crash\nthat seemed to set my very bones vibrating--a metallic, jangling crash,\nas the fall of heavy chains.  I thought that, then, I half opened my\neyes, and that in the dimness I had a fleeting glimpse of a figure clad\nin gossamer silk, with arms covered with barbaric bangles and slim\nankles surrounded by gold bands.  The girl was gone, even as I told\nmyself that she was an houri, and that I, though a Christian, had been\nconsigned by some error to the paradise of Mohammed.\n\nThen--a complete blank.\n\n\nMy head throbbed madly; my brain seemed to be clogged--inert; and\nthough my first, feeble movement was followed by the rattle of a chain,\nsome moments more elapsed ere I realized that the chain was fastened to\na steel collar--that the steel collar was clasped about my neck.\n\nI moaned weakly.\n\n\"Smith!\" I muttered, \"Where are you?  Smith!\"\n\nOn to my knees I struggled, and the pain on the top of my skull grew\nall but insupportable.  It was coming back to me now; how Nayland Smith\nand I had started for the hotel to warn Graham Guthrie; how, as we\npassed up the steps from the Embankment and into Essex Street, we saw\nthe big motor standing before the door of one of the offices.  I could\nrecall coming up level with the car--a modern limousine; but my mind\nretained no impression of our having passed it--only a vague memory of\na rush of footsteps--a blow.  Then, my vision of the hall of dragons,\nand now this real awakening to a worse reality.\n\nGroping in the darkness, my hands touched a body that lay close beside\nme.  My fingers sought and found the throat, sought and found the steel\ncollar about it.\n\n\"Smith,\" I groaned; and I shook the still form.  \"Smith, old man--speak\nto me!  Smith!\"\n\nCould he be dead?  Was this the end of his gallant fight with Dr.\nFu-Manchu and the murder group?  If so, what did the future hold for\nme--what had I to face?\n\nHe stirred beneath my trembling hands.\n\n\"Thank God!\"  I muttered, and I cannot deny that my joy was tainted\nwith selfishness.  For, waking in that impenetrable darkness, and yet\nobsessed with the dream I had dreamed, I had known what fear meant, at\nthe realization that alone, chained, I must face the dreadful Chinese\ndoctor in the flesh.  Smith began incoherent mutterings.\n\n\"Sand-bagged! . . . Look out, Petrie! . . . He has us at last! . . .\nOh, Heavens!\" . . . He struggled on to his knees, clutching at my hand.\n\n\"All right, old man,\" I said.  \"We are both alive!  So let's be\nthankful.\"\n\nA moment's silence, a groan, then:\n\n\"Petrie, I have dragged you into this.  God forgive me--\"\n\n\"Dry up, Smith,\" I said slowly.  \"I'm not a child.  There is no\nquestion of being dragged into the matter.  I'm here; and if I can be\nof any use, I'm glad I am here!\"\n\nHe grasped my hand.\n\n\"There were two Chinese, in European clothes--lord, how my head\nthrobs!--in that office door.  They sand-bagged us, Petrie--think of\nit!--in broad daylight, within hail of the Strand!  We were rushed into\nthe car--and it was all over, before--\" His voice grew faint.  \"God!\nthey gave me an awful knock!\"\n\n\"Why have we been spared, Smith?  Do you think he is saving us for--\"\n\n\"Don't, Petrie!  If you had been in China, if you had seen what I have\nseen--\"\n\nFootsteps sounded on the flagged passage.  A blade of light crept\nacross the floor towards us.  My brain was growing clearer.  The place\nhad a damp, earthen smell.  It was slimy--some noisome cellar.  A door\nwas thrown open and a man entered, carrying a lantern.  Its light\nshowed my surmise to be accurate, showed the slime-coated walls of a\ndungeon some fifteen feet square--shone upon the long yellow robe of\nthe man who stood watching us, upon the malignant, intellectual\ncountenance.\n\nIt was Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\nAt last they were face to face--the head of the great Yellow Movement,\nand the man who fought on behalf of the entire white race.  How can I\npaint the individual who now stood before us--perhaps the greatest\ngenius of modern times?\n\nOf him it had been fitly said that he had a brow like Shakespeare and a\nface like Satan.  Something serpentine, hypnotic, was in his very\npresence.  Smith drew one sharp breath, and was silent.  Together,\nchained to the wall, two mediaeval captives, living mockeries of our\nboasted modern security, we crouched before Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\nHe came forward with an indescribable gait, cat-like yet awkward,\ncarrying his high shoulders almost hunched.  He placed the lantern in a\nniche in the wall, never turning away the reptilian gaze of those eyes\nwhich must haunt my dreams forever.  They possessed a viridescence\nwhich hitherto I had supposed possible only in the eye of the cat--and\nthe film intermittently clouded their brightness--but I can speak of\nthem no more.\n\nI had never supposed, prior to meeting Dr. Fu-Manchu, that so intense a\nforce of malignancy could radiate--from any human being.  He spoke.\nHis English was perfect, though at times his words were oddly chosen;\nhis delivery alternately was guttural and sibilant.\n\n\"Mr. Smith and Dr. Petrie, your interference with my plans has gone too\nfar.  I have seriously turned my attention to you.\"\n\nHe displayed his teeth, small and evenly separated, but discolored in a\nway that was familiar to me.  I studied his eyes with a new\nprofessional interest, which even the extremity of our danger could not\nwholly banish.  Their greenness seemed to be of the iris; the pupil was\noddly contracted--a pin-point.\n\nSmith leaned his back against the wall with assumed indifference.\n\n\"You have presumed,\" continued Fu-Manchu, \"to meddle with a\nworld-change. Poor spiders--caught in the wheels of the inevitable!\nYou have linked my name with the futility of the Young China\nMovement--the name of Fu-Manchu!  Mr. Smith, you are an incompetent\nmeddler--I despise you!  Dr. Petrie, you are a fool--I am sorry for\nyou!\"\n\nHe rested one bony hand on his hip, narrowing the long eyes as he\nlooked down on us.  The purposeful cruelty of the man was inherent; it\nwas entirely untheatrical.  Still Smith remained silent.\n\n\"So I am determined to remove you from the scene of your blunders!\"\nadded Fu-Manchu.\n\n\"Opium will very shortly do the same for you!\" I rapped at him savagely.\n\nWithout emotion he turned the narrowed eyes upon me.\n\n\"That is a matter of opinion, Doctor,\" he said.  \"You may have lacked\nthe opportunities which have been mine for studying that subject--and\nin any event I shall not be privileged to enjoy your advice in the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"You will not long outlive me,\" I replied.  \"And our deaths will not\nprofit you, incidentally; because--\" Smith's foot touched mine.\n\n\"Because?\" inquired Fu-Manchu softly.\n\n\"Ah!  Mr. Smith is so prudent!  He is thinking that I have FILES!\" He\npronounced the word in a way that made me shudder.  \"Mr. Smith has seen\na WIRE JACKET!  Have you ever seen a wire jacket?  As a surgeon its\nfunctions would interest you!\"\n\nI stifled a cry that rose to my lips; for, with a shrill whistling\nsound, a small shape came bounding into the dimly lit vault, then shot\nupward.  A marmoset landed on the shoulder of Dr. Fu-Manchu and peered\ngrotesquely into the dreadful yellow face.  The Doctor raised his bony\nhand and fondled the little creature, crooning to it.\n\n\"One of my pets, Mr. Smith,\" he said, suddenly opening his eyes fully\nso that they blazed like green lamps.  \"I have others, equally useful.\nMy scorpions--have you met my scorpions?  No?  My pythons and\nhamadryads?  Then there are my fungi and my tiny allies, the bacilli.\nI have a collection in my laboratory quite unique.  Have you ever\nvisited Molokai, the leper island, Doctor?  No?  But Mr. Nayland Smith\nwill be familiar with the asylum at Rangoon!  And we must not forget my\nblack spiders, with their diamond eyes--my spiders, that sit in the\ndark and watch--then leap!\"\n\nHe raised his lean hands, so that the sleeve of the robe fell back to\nthe elbow, and the ape dropped, chattering, to the floor and ran from\nthe cellar.\n\n\"O God of Cathay!\" he cried, \"by what death shall these die--these\nmiserable ones who would bind thine Empire, which is boundless!\"\n\nLike some priest of Tezcat he stood, his eyes upraised to the roof, his\nlean body quivering--a sight to shock the most unimpressionable mind.\n\n\"He is mad!\" I whispered to Smith.  \"God help us, the man is a\ndangerous homicidal maniac!\"\n\nNayland Smith's tanned face was very drawn, but he shook his head\ngrimly.\n\n\"Dangerous, yes, I agree,\" he muttered; \"his existence is a danger to\nthe entire white race which, now, we are powerless to avert.\"\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu recovered himself, took up the lantern and, turning\nabruptly, walked to the door, with his awkward, yet feline gait.  At\nthe threshold be looked back.\n\n\"You would have warned Mr. Graham Guthrie?\" he said, in a soft voice.\n\"To-night, at half-past twelve, Mr. Graham Guthrie dies!\"\n\nSmith sat silent and motionless, his eyes fixed upon the speaker.\n\n\"You were in Rangoon in 1908?\" continued Dr. Fu-Manchu--\"you remember\nthe Call?\"\n\nFrom somewhere above us--I could not determine the exact\ndirection--came a low, wailing cry, an uncanny thing of falling\ncadences, which, in that dismal vault, with the sinister yellow-robed\nfigure at the door, seemed to pour ice into my veins.  Its effect upon\nSmith was truly extraordinary.  His face showed grayly in the faint\nlight, and I heard him draw a hissing breath through clenched teeth.\n\n\"It calls for you!\" said Fu-Manchu. \"At half-past twelve it calls for\nGraham Guthrie!\"\n\nThe door closed and darkness mantled us again.\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, \"what was that?\"  The horrors about us were playing\nhavoc with my nerves.\n\n\"It was the Call of Siva!\" replied Smith hoarsely.\n\n\"What is it?  Who uttered it?  What does it mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is, Petrie, nor who utters it.  But it means\ndeath!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nTHERE may be some who could have lain, chained to that noisome cell,\nand felt no fear--no dread of what the blackness might hold.  I confess\nthat I am not one of these.  I knew that Nayland Smith and I stood in\nthe path of the most stupendous genius who in the world's history had\ndevoted his intellect to crime.  I knew that the enormous wealth of the\npolitical group backing Dr. Fu-Manchu rendered him a menace to Europe\nand to America greater than that of the plague.  He was a scientist\ntrained at a great university--an explorer of nature's secrets, who had\ngone farther into the unknown, I suppose, than any living man.  His\nmission was to remove all obstacles--human obstacles--from the path of\nthat secret movement which was progressing in the Far East.  Smith and\nI were two such obstacles; and of all the horrible devices at his\ncommand, I wondered, and my tortured brain refused to leave the\nsubject, by which of them were we doomed to be dispatched?\n\nEven at that very moment some venomous centipede might be wriggling\ntowards me over the slime of the stones, some poisonous spider be\npreparing to drop from the roof!  Fu-Manchu might have released a\nserpent in the cellar, or the air be alive with microbes of a loathsome\ndisease!\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, scarcely recognizing my own voice, \"I can't bear this\nsuspense.  He intends to kill us, that is certain, but--\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" came the reply; \"he intends to learn our plans first.\"\n\n\"You mean--?\"\n\n\"You heard him speak of his files and of his wire jacket?\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" I groaned; \"can this be England?\"\n\nSmith laughed dryly, and I heard him fumbling with the steel collar\nabout his neck.\n\n\"I have one great hope,\" he said, \"since you share my captivity, but we\nmust neglect no minor chance.  Try with your pocket-knife if you can\nforce the lock.  I am trying to break this one.\"\n\nTruth to tell, the idea had not entered my half-dazed mind, but I\nimmediately acted upon my friend's suggestion, setting to work with the\nsmall blade of my knife.  I was so engaged, and, having snapped one\nblade, was about to open another, when a sound arrested me.  It came\nfrom beneath my feet.\n\n\"Smith,\" I whispered, \"listen!\"\n\nThe scraping and clicking which told of Smith's efforts ceased.\nMotionless, we sat in that humid darkness and listened.\n\nSomething was moving beneath the stones of the cellar.  I held my\nbreath; every nerve in my body was strung up.\n\nA line of light showed a few feet from where we lay.  It\nwidened--became an oblong.  A trap was lifted, and within a yard of me,\nthere rose a dimly seen head.  Horror I had expected--and death, or\nworse.  Instead, I saw a lovely face, crowned with a disordered mass of\ncurling hair; I saw a white arm upholding the stone slab, a shapely arm\nclasped about the elbow by a broad gold bangle.\n\nThe girl climbed into the cellar and placed the lantern on the stone\nfloor.  In the dim light she was unreal--a figure from an opium vision,\nwith her clinging silk draperies and garish jewelry, with her feet\nencased in little red slippers.  In short, this was the houri of my\nvision, materialized.  It was difficult to believe that we were in\nmodern, up-to-date England; easy to dream that we were the captives of\na caliph, in a dungeon in old Bagdad.\n\n\"My prayers are answered,\" said Smith softly.  \"She has come to save\nYOU.\"\n\n\"S-sh!\" warned the girl, and her wonderful eyes opened widely,\nfearfully.  \"A sound and he will kill us all.\"\n\nShe bent over me; a key jarred in the lock which had broken my\npenknife--and the collar was off.  As I rose to my feet the girl turned\nand released Smith.  She raised the lantern above the trap, and signed\nto us to descend the wooden steps which its light revealed.\n\n\"Your knife,\" she whispered to me.  \"Leave it on the floor.  He will\nthink you forced the locks.  Down!  Quickly!\"\n\nNayland Smith, stepping gingerly, disappeared into the darkness.  I\nrapidly followed.  Last of all came our mysterious friend, a gold band\nabout one of her ankles gleaming in the rays of the lantern which she\ncarried.  We stood in a low-arched passage.\n\n\"Tie your handkerchiefs over your eyes and do exactly as I tell you,\"\nshe ordered.\n\nNeither of us hesitated to obey her.  Blind-folded, I allowed her to\nlead me, and Smith rested his hand upon my shoulder.  In that order we\nproceeded, and came to stone steps, which we ascended.\n\n\"Keep to the wall on the left,\" came a whisper.  \"There is danger on\nthe right.\"\n\nWith my free hand I felt for and found the wall, and we pressed\nforward.  The atmosphere of the place through which we were passing was\nsteamy, and loaded with an odor like that of exotic plant life.  But a\nfaint animal scent crept to my nostrils, too, and there was a subdued\nstir about me, infinitely suggestive--mysterious.\n\nNow my feet sank in a soft carpet, and a curtain brushed my shoulder.\nA gong sounded.  We stopped.\n\nThe din of distant drumming came to my ears.\n\n\"Where in Heaven's name are we?\" hissed Smith in my ear; \"that is a\ntom-tom!\"\n\n\"S-sh!  S-sh!\"\n\nThe little hand grasping mine quivered nervously.  We were near a door\nor a window, for a breath of perfume was wafted through the air; and it\nreminded me of my other meetings with the beautiful woman who was now\nleading us from the house of Fu-Manchu; who, with her own lips, had\ntold me that she was his slave.  Through the horrible phantasmagoria\nshe flitted--a seductive vision, her piquant loveliness standing out\nrichly in its black setting of murder and devilry.  Not once, but a\nthousand times, I had tried to reason out the nature of the tie which\nbound her to the sinister Doctor.\n\nSilence fell.\n\n\"Quick!  This way!\"\n\nDown a thickly carpeted stair we went.  Our guide opened a door, and\nled us along a passage.  Another door was opened; and we were in the\nopen air.  But the girl never tarried, pulling me along a graveled\npath, with a fresh breeze blowing in my face, and along until,\nunmistakably, I stood upon the river bank.  Now, planking creaked to\nour tread; and looking downward beneath the handkerchief, I saw the\ngleam of water beneath my feet.\n\n\"Be careful!\"  I was warned, and found myself stepping into a narrow\nboat--a punt.\n\nNayland Smith followed, and the girl pushed the punt off and poled out\ninto the stream.\n\n\"Don't speak!\" she directed.\n\nMy brain was fevered; I scarce knew if I dreamed and was waking, or if\nthe reality ended with my imprisonment in the clammy cellar and this\nsilent escape, blindfolded, upon the river with a girl for our guide\nwho might have stepped out of the pages of \"The Arabian Nights\" were\nfantasy--the mockery of sleep.\n\nIndeed, I began seriously to doubt if this stream whereon we floated,\nwhose waters plashed and tinkled about us, were the Thames, the Tigris,\nor the Styx.\n\nThe punt touched a bank.\n\n\"You will hear a clock strike in a few minutes,\" said the girl, with\nher soft, charming accent, \"but I rely upon your honor not to remove\nthe handkerchiefs until then.  You owe me this.\"\n\n\"We do!\" said Smith fervently.\n\nI heard him scrambling to the bank, and a moment later a soft hand was\nplaced in mine, and I, too, was guided on to terra firma.  Arrived on\nthe bank, I still held the girl's hand, drawing her towards me.\n\n\"You must not go back,\" I whispered.  \"We will take care of you.  You\nmust not return to that place.\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" she said.  \"When, once, I asked you to take me from him,\nyou spoke of police protection; that was your answer, police\nprotection!  You would let them lock me up--imprison me--and make me\nbetray him!  For what?  For what?\"  She wrenched herself free.  \"How\nlittle you understand me.  Never mind.  Perhaps one day you will know!\nUntil the clock strikes!\"\n\nShe was gone.  I heard the creak of the punt, the drip of the water\nfrom the pole.  Fainter it grew, and fainter.\n\n\"What is her secret?\" muttered Smith, beside me.  \"Why does she cling\nto that monster?\"\n\nThe distant sound died away entirely.  A clock began to strike; it\nstruck the half-hour. In an instant my handkerchief was off, and so was\nSmith's. We stood upon a towing-path. Away to the left the moon shone\nupon the towers and battlements of an ancient fortress.\n\nIt was Windsor Castle.\n\n\"Half-past ten,\" cried Smith.  \"Two hours to save Graham Guthrie!\"\n\nWe had exactly fourteen minutes in which to catch the last train to\nWaterloo; and we caught it.  But I sank into a corner of the\ncompartment in a state bordering upon collapse.  Neither of us, I\nthink, could have managed another twenty yards.  With a lesser stake\nthan a human life at issue, I doubt if we should have attempted that\ndash to Windsor station.\n\n\"Due at Waterloo at eleven-fifty-one,\" panted Smith.  \"That gives us\nthirty-nine minutes to get to the other side of the river and reach his\nhotel.\"\n\n\"Where in Heaven's name is that house situated?  Did we come up or down\nstream?\"\n\n\"I couldn't determine.  But at any rate, it stands close to the\nriverside.  It should be merely a question of time to identify it.  I\nshall set Scotland Yard to work immediately; but I am hoping for\nnothing.  Our escape will warn him.\"\n\nI said no more for a time, sitting wiping the perspiration from my\nforehead and watching my friend load his cracked briar with the\nbroadcut Latakia mixture.\n\n\"Smith,\" I said at last, \"what was that horrible wailing we heard, and\nwhat did Fu-Manchu mean when he referred to Rangoon?  I noticed how it\naffected you.\"\n\nMy friend nodded and lighted his pipe.\n\n\"There was a ghastly business there in 1908 or early in 1909,\" he\nreplied:  \"an utterly mysterious epidemic.  And this beastly wailing\nwas associated with it.\"\n\n\"In what way?  And what do you mean by an epidemic?\"\n\n\"It began, I believe, at the Palace Mansions Hotel, in the cantonments.\nA young American, whose name I cannot recall, was staying there on\nbusiness connected with some new iron buildings.  One night he went to\nhis room, locked the door, and jumped out of the window into the\ncourtyard.  Broke his neck, of course.\"\n\n\"Suicide?\"\n\n\"Apparently.  But there were singular features in the case.  For\ninstance, his revolver lay beside him, fully loaded!\"\n\n\"In the courtyard?\"\n\n\"In the courtyard!\"\n\n\"Was it murder by any chance?\"\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"His door was found locked from the inside; had to be broken in.\"\n\n\"But the wailing business?\"\n\n\"That began later, or was only noticed later.  A French doctor, named\nLafitte, died in exactly the same way.\"\n\n\"At the same place?\"\n\n\"At the same hotel; but he occupied a different room.  Here is the\nextraordinary part of the affair:  a friend shared the room with him,\nand actually saw him go!\"\n\n\"Saw him leap from the window?\"\n\n\"Yes.  The friend--an Englishman--was aroused by the uncanny wailing.\nI was in Rangoon at the time, so that I know more of the case of\nLafitte than of that of the American.  I spoke to the man about it\npersonally.  He was an electrical engineer, Edward Martin, and he told\nme that the cry seemed to come from above him.\"\n\n\"It seemed to come from above when we heard it at Fu-Manchu's house.\"\n\n\"Martin sat up in bed, it was a clear moonlight night--the sort of\nmoonlight you get in Burma.  Lafitte, for some reason, had just gone to\nthe window.  His friend saw him look out.  The next moment with a\ndreadful scream, he threw himself forward--and crashed down into the\ncourtyard!\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Martin ran to the window and looked down.  Lafitte's scream had\naroused the place, of course.  But there was absolutely nothing to\naccount for the occurrence.  There was no balcony, no ledge, by means\nof which anyone could reach the window.\"\n\n\"But how did you come to recognize the cry?\"\n\n\"I stopped at the Palace Mansions for some time; and one night this\nuncanny howling aroused me.  I heard it quite distinctly, and am never\nlikely to forget it.  It was followed by a hoarse yell.  The man in the\nnext room, an orchid hunter, had gone the same way as the others!\"\n\n\"Did you change your quarters?\"\n\n\"No. Fortunately for the reputation of the hotel--a first-class\nestablishment--several similar cases occurred elsewhere, both in\nRangoon, in Prome and in Moulmein.  A story got about the native\nquarter, and was fostered by some mad fakir, that the god Siva was\nreborn and that the cry was his call for victims; a ghastly story,\nwhich led to an outbreak of dacoity and gave the District\nSuperintendent no end of trouble.\"\n\n\"Was there anything unusual about the bodies?\"\n\n\"They all developed marks after death, as though they had been\nstrangled!  The marks were said all to possess a peculiar form, though\nit was not appreciable to my eye; and this, again, was declared to be\nthe five heads of Siva.\"\n\n\"Were the deaths confined to Europeans?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  Several Burmans and others died in the same way.  At first\nthere was a theory that the victims had contracted leprosy and\ncommitted suicide as a result; but the medical evidence disproved that.\nThe Call of Siva became a perfect nightmare throughout Burma.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear it again, before this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I heard it on the Upper Irrawaddy one clear, moonlight night,\nand a Colassie--a deck-hand--leaped from the top deck of the steamer\naboard which I was traveling!  My God!  to think that the fiend\nFu-Manchu has brought That to England!\"\n\n\"But brought what, Smith?\" I cried, in perplexity.  \"What has he\nbrought?  An evil spirit?  A mental disease?  What is it?  What CAN it\nbe?\"\n\n\"A new agent of death, Petrie!  Something born in a plague-spot of\nBurma--the home of much that is unclean and much that is inexplicable.\nHeaven grant that we be in time, and are able to save Guthrie.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nTHE train was late, and as our cab turned out of Waterloo Station and\nbegan to ascend to the bridge, from a hundred steeples rang out the\ngongs of midnight, the bell of St. Paul's raised above them all to vie\nwith the deep voice of Big Ben.\n\nI looked out from the cab window across the river to where, towering\nabove the Embankment, that place of a thousand tragedies, the light of\nsome of London's greatest caravanserais formed a sort of minor\nconstellation.  From the subdued blaze that showed the public\nsupper-rooms I looked up to the hundreds of starry points marking the\nprivate apartments of those giant inns.\n\nI thought how each twinkling window denoted the presence of some bird\nof passage, some wanderer temporarily abiding in our midst.  There,\nfloor piled upon floor above the chattering throngs, were these less\ngregarious units, each something of a mystery to his fellow-guests,\neach in his separate cell; and each as remote from real human\ncompanionship as if that cell were fashioned, not in the bricks of\nLondon, but in the rocks of Hindustan!\n\nIn one of those rooms Graham Guthrie might at that moment be sleeping,\nall unaware that he would awake to the Call of Siva, to the summons of\ndeath.  As we neared the Strand, Smith stopped the cab, discharging the\nman outside Sotheby's auction-rooms.\n\n\"One of the doctor's watch-dogs may be in the foyer,\" he said\nthoughtfully, \"and it might spoil everything if we were seen to go to\nGuthrie's rooms.  There must be a back entrance to the kitchens, and so\non?\"\n\n\"There is,\" I replied quickly.  \"I have seen the vans delivering there.\nBut have we time?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Lead on.\"\n\nWe walked up the Strand and hurried westward.  Into that narrow court,\nwith its iron posts and descending steps, upon which opens a well-known\nwine-cellar, we turned.  Then, going parallel with the Strand, but on\nthe Embankment level, we ran round the back of the great hotel, and\ncame to double doors which were open.  An arc lamp illuminated the\ninterior and a number of men were at work among the casks, crates and\npackages stacked about the place.  We entered.\n\n\"Hallo!\" cried a man in a white overall, \"where d'you think you're\ngoing?\"\n\nSmith grasped him by the arm.\n\n\"I want to get to the public part of the hotel without being seen from\nthe entrance hall,\" he said.  \"Will you please lead the way?\"\n\n\"Here--\" began the other, staring.\n\n\"Don't waste time!\" snapped my friend, in that tone of authority which\nhe knew so well how to assume.  \"It's a matter of life and death.  Lead\nthe way, I say!\"\n\n\"Police, sir?\" asked the man civilly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Smith; \"hurry!\"\n\nOff went our guide without further demur.  Skirting sculleries,\nkitchens, laundries and engine-rooms, he led us through those\nmysterious labyrinths which have no existence for the guest above, but\nwhich contain the machinery that renders these modern khans the\nAladdin's palaces they are.  On a second-floor landing we met a man in\na tweed suit, to whom our cicerone presented us.\n\n\"Glad I met you, sir.  Two gentlemen from the police.\"\n\nThe man regarded us haughtily with a suspicious smile.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.  \"You're not from Scotland Yard, at any rate!\"\n\nSmith pulled out a card and thrust it into the speaker's hand.\n\n\"If you are the hotel detective,\" he said, \"take us without delay to\nMr. Graham Guthrie.\"\n\nA marked change took place in the other's demeanor on glancing at the\ncard in his hand.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he said deferentially, \"but, of course, I didn't know\nwho I was speaking to.  We all have instructions to give you every\nassistance.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Guthrie in his room?\"\n\n\"He's been in his room for some time, sir.  You will want to get there\nwithout being seen?  This way.  We can join the lift on the third\nfloor.\"\n\nOff we went again, with our new guide.  In the lift:\n\n\"Have you noticed anything suspicious about the place to-night?\" asked\nSmith.\n\n\"I have!\" was the startling reply.  \"That accounts for your finding me\nwhere you did.  My usual post is in the lobby.  But about eleven\no'clock, when the theater people began to come in I had a hazy sort of\nimpression that someone or something slipped past in the\ncrowd--something that had no business in the hotel.\"\n\nWe got out of the lift.\n\n\"I don't quite follow you,\" said Smith.  \"If you thought you saw\nsomething entering, you must have formed a more or less definite\nimpression regarding it.\"\n\n\"That's the funny part of the business,\" answered the man doggedly.  \"I\ndidn't!  But as I stood at the top of the stairs I could have sworn\nthat there was something crawling up behind a party--two ladies and two\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"A dog, for instance?\"\n\n\"It didn't strike me as being a dog, sir.  Anyway, when the party\npassed me, there was nothing there.  Mind you, whatever it was, it\nhadn't come in by the front.  I have made inquiries everywhere, but\nwithout result.\" He stopped abruptly.  \"No. 189--Mr. Guthrie's door,\nsir.\"\n\nSmith knocked.\n\n\"Hallo!\" came a muffled voice; \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"Open the door!  Don't delay; it is important.\"\n\nHe turned to the hotel detective.\n\n\"Stay right there where you can watch the stairs and the lift,\" he\ninstructed; \"and note everyone and everything that passes this door.\nBut whatever you see or hear, do nothing without my orders.\"\n\nThe man moved off, and the door was opened.  Smith whispered in my ear:\n\n\"Some creature of Dr. Fu-Manchu is in the hotel!\"\n\nMr. Graham Guthrie, British resident in North Bhutan, was a big,\nthick-set man--gray-haired and florid, with widely opened eyes of the\ntrue fighting blue, a bristling mustache and prominent shaggy brows.\nNayland Smith introduced himself tersely, proffering his card and an\nopen letter.\n\n\"Those are my credentials, Mr. Guthrie,\" he said; \"so no doubt you will\nrealize that the business which brings me and my friend, Dr. Petrie,\nhere at such an hour is of the first importance.\"\n\nHe switched off the light.\n\n\"There is no time for ceremony,\" he explained.  \"It is now twenty-five\nminutes past twelve.  At half-past an attempt will be made upon your\nlife!\"\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" said the other, who, arrayed in his pajamas, was seated on\nthe edge of the bed, \"you alarm me very greatly.  I may mention that I\nwas advised of your presence in England this morning.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything respecting the person called Fu-Manchu--Dr.\nFu-Manchu?\"\n\n\"Only what I was told to-day--that he is the agent of an advanced\npolitical group.\"\n\n\"It is opposed to his interests that you should return to Bhutan.  A\nmore gullible agent would be preferable.  Therefore, unless you\nimplicitly obey my instructions, you will never leave England!\"\n\nGraham Guthrie breathed quickly.  I was growing more used to the gloom,\nand I could dimly discern him, his face turned towards Nayland Smith,\nwhilst with his hand he clutched the bed-rail. Such a visit as ours, I\nthink, must have shaken the nerve of any man.\n\n\"But, Mr. Smith,\" he said, \"surely I am safe enough here!  The place is\nfull of American visitors at present, and I have had to be content with\na room right at the top; so that the only danger I apprehend is that of\nfire.\"\n\n\"There is another danger,\" replied Smith.  \"The fact that you are at\nthe top of the building enhances that danger.  Do you recall anything\nof the mysterious epidemic which broke out in Rangoon in 1908--the\ndeaths due to the Call of Siva?\"\n\n\"I read of it in the Indian papers,\" said Guthrie uneasily.  \"Suicides,\nwere they not?\"\n\n\"No!\" snapped Smith.  \"Murders!\"\n\nThere was a brief silence.\n\n\"From what I recall of the cases,\" said Guthrie, \"that seems\nimpossible.  In several instances the victims threw themselves from the\nwindows of locked rooms--and the windows were quite inaccessible.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Smith; and in the dim light his revolver gleamed\ndully, as he placed it on the small table beside the bed.  \"Except that\nyour door is unlocked, the conditions to-night are identical.  Silence,\nplease, I hear a clock striking.\"\n\nIt was Big Ben.  It struck the half-hour, leaving the stillness\ncomplete.  In that room, high above the activity which yet prevailed\nbelow, high above the supping crowds in the hotel, high above the\nstarving crowds on the Embankment, a curious chill of isolation swept\nabout me.  Again I realized how, in the very heart of the great\nmetropolis, a man may be as far from aid as in the heart of a desert.\nI was glad that I was not alone in that room--marked with the\ndeath-mark of Fu-Manchu; and I am certain that Graham Guthrie welcomed\nhis unexpected company.\n\nI may have mentioned the fact before, but on this occasion it became so\npeculiarly evident to me that I am constrained to record it here--I\nrefer to the sense of impending danger which invariably preceded a\nvisit from Fu-Manchu. Even had I not known that an attempt was to be\nmade that night, I should have realized it, as, strung to high tension,\nI waited in the darkness.  Some invisible herald went ahead of the\ndreadful Chinaman, proclaiming his coming to every nerve in one's body.\nIt was like a breath of astral incense, announcing the presence of the\npriests of death.\n\nA wail, low but singularly penetrating, falling in minor cadences to a\nnew silence, came from somewhere close at hand.\n\n\"My God!\" hissed Guthrie, \"what was that?\"\n\n\"The Call of Siva,\" whispered Smith.\n\n\"Don't stir, for your life!\"\n\nGuthrie was breathing hard.\n\nI knew that we were three; that the hotel detective was within hail;\nthat there was a telephone in the room; that the traffic of the\nEmbankment moved almost beneath us; but I knew, and am not ashamed to\nconfess, that King Fear had icy fingers about my heart.  It was\nawful--that tense waiting--for--what?\n\nThree taps sounded--very distinctly upon the window.\n\nGraham Guthrie started so as to shake the bed.\n\n\"It's supernatural!\" he muttered--all that was Celtic in his blood\nrecoiling from the omen.  \"Nothing human can reach that window!\"\n\"S-sh!\" from Smith.  \"Don't stir.\"\n\nThe tapping was repeated.\n\nSmith softly crossed the room.  My heart was beating painfully.  He\nthrew open the window.  Further inaction was impossible.  I joined him;\nand we looked out into the empty air.\n\n\"Don't come too near, Petrie!\" he warned over his shoulder.\n\nOne on either side of the open window, we stood and looked down at the\nmoving Embankment lights, at the glitter of the Thames, at the\nsilhouetted buildings on the farther bank, with the Shot Tower starting\nabove them all.\n\nThree taps sounded on the panes above us.\n\nIn all my dealings with Dr. Fu-Manchu I had had to face nothing so\nuncanny as this.  What Burmese ghoul had he loosed?  Was it outside, in\nthe air?  Was it actually in the room?\n\n\"Don't let me go, Petrie!\" whispered Smith suddenly.  \"Get a tight hold\non me!\"\n\nThat was the last straw; for I thought that some dreadful fascination\nwas impelling my friend to hurl himself out!  Wildly I threw my arms\nabout him, and Guthrie leaped forward to help.\n\nSmith leaned from the window and looked up.\n\nOne choking cry he gave--smothered, inarticulate--and I found him\nslipping from my grip--being drawn out of the window--drawn to his\ndeath!\n\n\"Hold him, Guthrie!\" I gasped hoarsely.  \"My God, he's going!  Hold\nhim!\"\n\nMy friend writhed in our grasp, and I saw him stretch his arm upward.\nThe crack of his revolver came, and he collapsed on to the floor,\ncarrying me with him.\n\nBut as I fell I heard a scream above.  Smith's revolver went hurtling\nthrough the air, and, hard upon it, went a black shape--flashing past\nthe open window into the gulf of the night.\n\n\"The light!  The light!\"  I cried.\n\nGuthrie ran and turned on the light.  Nayland Smith, his eyes starting\nfrom his head, his face swollen, lay plucking at a silken cord which\nshowed tight about his throat.\n\n\"It was a Thug!\" screamed Guthrie.  \"Get the rope off!  He's choking!\"\n\nMy hands a-twitch, I seized the strangling-cord.\n\n\"A knife!  Quick!\"  I cried.  \"I have lost mine!\"\n\nGuthrie ran to the dressing-table and passed me an open penknife.  I\nsomehow forced the blade between the rope and Smith's swollen neck, and\nsevered the deadly silken thing.\n\nSmith made a choking noise, and fell back, swooning in my arms.\n\n\nWhen, later, we stood looking down upon the mutilated thing which had\nbeen brought in from where it fell, Smith showed me a mark on the\nbrow--close beside the wound where his bullet had entered.\n\n\"The mark of Kali,\" he said.  \"The man was a phansigar--a religious\nstrangler.  Since Fu-Manchu has dacoits in his service I might have\nexpected that he would have Thugs.  A group of these fiends would seem\nto have fled into Burma; so that the mysterious epidemic in Rangoon was\nreally an outbreak of thuggee--on slightly improved lines!  I had\nsuspected something of the kind but, naturally, I had not looked for\nThugs near Rangoon.  My unexpected resistance led the strangler to\nbungle the rope.  You have seen how it was fastened about my throat?\nThat was unscientific.  The true method, as practiced by the group\noperating in Burma, was to throw the line about the victim's neck and\njerk him from the window.  A man leaning from an open window is very\nnicely poised: it requires only a slight jerk to pitch him forward.  No\nloop was used, but a running line, which, as the victim fell, remained\nin the hand of the murderer.  No clew!  Therefore we see at once what\ncommended the system to Fu-Manchu.\"\n\nGraham Guthrie, very pale, stood looking down at the dead strangler.\n\n\"I owe you my life, Mr. Smith,\" he said.  \"If you had come five minutes\nlater--\"\n\nHe grasped Smith's hand.\n\n\"You see,\" Guthrie continued, \"no one thought of looking for a Thug in\nBurma!  And no one thought of the ROOF!  These fellows are as active as\nmonkeys, and where an ordinary man would infallibly break his neck,\nthey are entirely at home.  I might have chosen my room especially for\nthe business!\"\n\n\"He slipped in late this evening,\" said Smith.  \"The hotel detective\nsaw him, but these stranglers are as elusive as shadows, otherwise,\ndespite their having changed the scene of their operations, not one\ncould have survived.\"\n\n\"Didn't you mention a case of this kind on the Irrawaddy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the reply; \"and I know of what you are thinking.  The\nsteamers of the Irrawaddy flotilla have a corrugated-iron roof over the\ntop deck.  The Thug must have been lying up there as the Colassie\npassed on the deck below.\"\n\n\"But, Smith, what is the motive of the Call?\" I continued.\n\n\"Partly religious,\" he explained, \"and partly to wake the victims!  You\nare perhaps going to ask me how Dr. Fu-Manchu has obtained power over\nsuch people as phansigars?  I can only reply that Dr. Fu-Manchu has\nsecret knowledge of which, so far, we know absolutely nothing; but,\ndespite all, at last I begin to score.\"\n\n\"You do,\" I agreed; \"but your victory took you near to death.\"\n\n\"I owe my life to you, Petrie,\" he said.  \"Once to your strength of\narm, and once to--\"\n\n\"Don't speak of her, Smith,\" I interrupted.  \"Dr. Fu-Manchu may have\ndiscovered the part she played!  In which event--\"\n\n\"God help her!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nUPON the following day we were afoot again, and shortly at handgrips\nwith the enemy.  In retrospect, that restless time offers a chaotic\nprospect, with no peaceful spot amid its turmoils.\n\nAll that was reposeful in nature seemed to have become an irony and a\nmockery to us--who knew how an evil demigod had his sacrificial altars\namid our sweetest groves.  This idea ruled strongly in my mind upon\nthat soft autumnal day.\n\n\"The net is closing in,\" said Nayland Smith.\n\n\"Let us hope upon a big catch,\" I replied, with a laugh.\n\nBeyond where the Thames tided slumberously seaward showed the roofs of\nRoyal Windsor, the castle towers showing through the autumn haze.  The\npeace of beautiful Thames-side was about us.\n\nThis was one of the few tangible clews upon which thus far we had\nchanced; but at last it seemed indeed that we were narrowing the\nresources of that enemy of the white race who was writing his name over\nEngland in characters of blood.  To capture Dr. Fu-Manchu we did not\nhope; but at least there was every promise of destroying one of the\nenemy's strongholds.\n\nWe had circled upon the map a tract of country cut by the Thames, with\nWindsor for its center.  Within that circle was the house from which\nmiraculously we had escaped--a house used by the most highly organized\ngroup in the history of criminology.  So much we knew.  Even if we\nfound the house, and this was likely enough, to find it vacated by\nFu-Manchu and his mysterious servants we were prepared.  But it would\nbe a base destroyed.\n\nWe were working upon a methodical plan, and although our cooperators\nwere invisible, these numbered no fewer than twelve--all of them\nexperienced men.  Thus far we had drawn blank, but the place for which\nSmith and I were making now came clearly into view:  an old mansion\nsituated in extensive walled grounds.  Leaving the river behind us, we\nturned sharply to the right along a lane flanked by a high wall.  On an\nopen patch of ground, as we passed, I noted a gypsy caravan.  An old\nwoman was seated on the steps, her wrinkled face bent, her chin resting\nin the palm of her hand.\n\nI scarcely glanced at her, but pressed on, nor did I notice that my\nfriend no longer was beside me.  I was all anxiety to come to some\npoint from whence I might obtain a view of the house; all anxiety to\nknow if this was the abode of our mysterious enemy--the place where he\nworked amid his weird company, where he bred his deadly scorpions and\nhis bacilli, reared his poisonous fungi, from whence he dispatched his\nmurder ministers.  Above all, perhaps, I wondered if this would prove\nto be the hiding-place of the beautiful slave girl who was such a\npotent factor in the Doctor's plans, but a two-edged sword which yet we\nhoped to turn upon Fu-Manchu. Even in the hands of a master, a woman's\nbeauty is a dangerous weapon.\n\nA cry rang out behind me.  I turned quickly.  And a singular sight met\nmy gaze.\n\nNayland Smith was engaged in a furious struggle with the old gypsy\nwoman!  His long arms clasped about her, he was roughly dragging her\nout into the roadway, she fighting like a wild thing--silently,\nfiercely.\n\nSmith often surprised me, but at that sight, frankly, I thought that he\nwas become bereft of reason.  I ran back; and I had almost reached the\nscene of this incredible contest, and Smith now was evidently hard put\nto it to hold his own when a man, swarthy, with big rings in his ears,\nleaped from the caravan.\n\nOne quick glance he threw in our direction, and made off towards the\nriver.\n\nSmith twisted round upon me, never releasing his hold of the woman.\n\n\"After him, Petrie!\" he cried.  \"After him.  Don't let him escape.\nIt's a dacoit!\"\n\nMy brain in a confused whirl; my mind yet disposed to a belief that my\nfriend had lost his senses, the word \"dacoit\" was sufficient.\n\nI started down the road after the fleetly running man.  Never once did\nhe glance behind him, so that he evidently had occasion to fear\npursuit.  The dusty road rang beneath my flying footsteps.  That sense\nof fantasy, which claimed me often enough in those days of our struggle\nwith the titanic genius whose victory meant the victory of the yellow\nraces over the white, now had me fast in its grip again.  I was an\nactor in one of those dream-scenes of the grim Fu-Manchu drama.\n\nOut over the grass and down to the river's brink ran the gypsy who was\nno gypsy, but one of that far more sinister brotherhood, the dacoits.\nI was close upon his heels.  But I was not prepared for him to leap in\namong the rushes at the margin of the stream; and seeing him do this I\npulled up quickly.  Straight into the water he plunged; and I saw that\nhe held some object in his hand.  He waded out; he dived; and as I\ngained the bank and looked to right and left he had vanished\ncompletely.  Only ever-widening rings showed where he had been. I had\nhim.\n\nFor directly he rose to the surface he would be visible from either\nbank, and with the police whistle which I carried I could, if\nnecessary, summon one of the men in hiding across the stream.  I\nwaited.  A wild-fowl floated serenely past, untroubled by this strange\ninvasion of his precincts.  A full minute I waited.  From the lane\nbehind me came Smith's voice:\n\n\"Don't let him escape, Petrie!\"\n\nNever lifting my eyes from the water, I waved my hand reassuringly.\nBut still the dacoit did not rise.  I searched the surface in all\ndirections as far as my eyes could reach; but no swimmer showed above\nit.  Then it was that I concluded he had dived too deeply, become\nentangled in the weeds and was drowned.  With a final glance to right\nand left and some feeling of awe at this sudden tragedy--this grim\ngoing out of a life at glorious noonday--I turned away.  Smith had the\nwoman securely; but I had not taken five steps towards him when a faint\nsplash behind warned me.  Instinctively I ducked.  From whence that\nsaving instinct arose I cannot surmise, but to it I owed my life.  For\nas I rapidly lowered my head, something hummed past me, something that\nflew out over the grass bank, and fell with a jangle upon the dusty\nroadside.  A knife!\n\nI turned and bounded back to the river's brink.  I heard a faint cry\nbehind me, which could only have come from the gypsy woman.  Nothing\ndisturbed the calm surface of the water.  The reach was lonely of\nrowers.  Out by the farther bank a girl was poling a punt along, and\nher white-clad figure was the only living thing that moved upon the\nriver within the range of the most expert knife-thrower.\n\nTo say that I was nonplused is to say less than the truth; I was\namazed.  That it was the dacoit who had shown me this murderous\nattention I could not doubt.  But where in Heaven's name WAS he?  He\ncould not humanly have remained below water for so long; yet he\ncertainly was not above, was not upon the surface, concealed amongst\nthe reeds, nor hidden upon the bank.\n\nThere, in the bright sunshine, a consciousness of the eerie possessed\nme.  It was with an uncomfortable feeling that my phantom foe might be\naiming a second knife at my back that I turned away and hastened\ntowards Smith.  My fearful expectations were not realized, and I picked\nup the little weapon which had so narrowly missed me, and with it in my\nhand rejoined my friend.\n\nHe was standing with one arm closely clasped about the apparently\nexhausted woman, and her dark eyes were fixed upon him with an\nextraordinary expression.\n\n\"What does it mean, Smith?\" I began.\n\nBut he interrupted me.\n\n\"Where is the dacoit?\" he demanded rapidly.\n\n\"Since he seemingly possesses the attributes of a fish,\" I replied, \"I\ncannot pretend to say.\"\n\nThe gypsy woman lifted her eyes to mine and laughed.  Her laughter was\nmusical, not that of such an old hag as Smith held captive; it was\nfamiliar, too.\n\nI started and looked closely into the wizened face.\n\n\"He's tricked you,\" said Smith, an angry note in his voice.  \"What is\nthat you have in your hand?\"\n\nI showed him the knife, and told him how it had come into my possession.\n\n\"I know,\" he rapped.  \"I saw it.  He was in the water not three yards\nfrom where you stood.  You must have seen him.  Was there nothing\nvisible?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThe woman laughed again, and again I wondered.\n\n\"A wild-fowl,\" I added; \"nothing else.\"\n\n\"A wild-fowl,\" snapped Smith.  \"If you will consult your recollections\nof the habits of wild-fowl you will see that this particular specimen\nwas a RARA AVIS. It's an old trick, Petrie, but a good one, for it is\nused in decoying.  A dacoit's head was concealed in that wild-fowl!\nIt's useless.  He has certainly made good his escape by now.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, somewhat crestfallen, \"why are you detaining this\ngypsy woman?\"\n\n\"Gypsy woman!\" he laughed, hugging her tightly as she made an impatient\nmovement.  \"Use your eyes, old man.\"\n\nHe jerked the frowsy wig from her head, and beneath was a cloud of\ndisordered hair that shimmered in the sunlight.\n\n\"A wet sponge will do the rest,\" he said.\n\nInto my eyes, widely opened in wonder, looked the dark eyes of the\ncaptive; and beneath the disguise I picked out the charming features of\nthe slave girl.  There were tears on the whitened lashes, and she was\nsubmissive now.\n\n\"This time,\" said my friend hardly, \"we have fairly captured her--and\nwe will hold her.\"\n\nFrom somewhere up-stream came a faint call.\n\n\"The dacoit!\"\n\nNayland Smith's lean body straightened; he stood alert, strung up.\n\nAnother call answered, and a third responded.  Then followed the flatly\nshrill note of a police whistle, and I noted a column of black vapor\nrising beyond the wall, mounting straight to heaven as the smoke of a\nwelcome offering.\n\nThe surrounded mansion was in flames!\n\n\"Curse it!\" rapped Smith.  \"So this time we were right.  But, of\ncourse, he has had ample opportunity to remove his effects.  I knew\nthat.  The man's daring is incredible.  He has given himself till the\nvery last moment--and we blundered upon two of the outposts.\"\n\n\"I lost one.\"\n\n\"No matter.  We have the other.  I expect no further arrests, and the\nhouse will have been so well fired by the Doctor's servants that\nnothing can save it.  I fear its ashes will afford us no clew, Petrie;\nbut we have secured a lever which should serve to disturb Fu-Manchu's\nworld.\"\n\nHe glanced at the queer figure which hung submissively in his arms.\nShe looked up proudly.\n\n\"You need not hold me so tight,\" she said, in her soft voice.  \"I will\ncome with you.\"\n\nThat I moved amid singular happenings, you, who have borne with me thus\nfar, have learned, and that I witnessed many curious scenes; but of the\nmany such scenes in that race-drama wherein Nayland Smith and Dr.\nFu-Manchu played the leading parts, I remember none more bizarre than\nthe one at my rooms that afternoon.\n\nWithout delay, and without taking the Scotland Yard men into our\nconfidence, we had hurried our prisoner back to London, for my friend's\nauthority was supreme.  A strange trio we were, and one which excited\nno little comment; but the journey came to an end at last.  Now we were\nin my unpretentious sitting-room--the room wherein Smith first had\nunfolded to me the story of Dr. Fu-Manchu and of the great secret\nsociety which sought to upset the balance of the world--to place Europe\nand America beneath the scepter of Cathay.\n\nI sat with my elbows upon the writing-table, my chin in my hands; Smith\nrestlessly paced the floor, relighting his blackened briar a dozen\ntimes in as many minutes.  In the big arm-chair the pseudogypsy was\ncurled up.  A brief toilet had converted the wizened old woman's face\ninto that of a fascinatingly pretty girl.  Wildly picturesque she\nlooked in her ragged Romany garb.  She held a cigarette in her fingers\nand watched us through lowered lashes.\n\nSeemingly, with true Oriental fatalism, she was quite reconciled to her\nfate, and ever and anon she would bestow upon me a glance from her\nbeautiful eyes which few men, I say with confidence, could have\nsustained unmoved.  Though I could not be blind to the emotions of that\npassionate Eastern soul, yet I strove not to think of them.  Accomplice\nof an arch-murderer she might be; but she was dangerously lovely.\n\n\"That man who was with you,\" said Smith, suddenly turning upon her,\n\"was in Burma up till quite recently.  He murdered a fisherman thirty\nmiles above Prome only a mouth before I left.  The D.S.P. had placed a\nthousand rupees on his head.  Am I right?\"\n\nThe girl shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Suppose--What then?\" she asked.\n\n\"Suppose I handed you over to the police?\" suggested Smith.  But he\nspoke without conviction, for in the recent past we both had owed our\nlives to this girl.\n\n\"As you please,\" she replied.  \"The police would learn nothing.\"\n\n\"You do not belong to the Far East,\" my friend said abruptly.  \"You may\nhave Eastern blood in your veins, but you are no kin of Fu-Manchu.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" she admitted, and knocked the ash from her cigarette.\n\n\"Will you tell me where to find Fu-Manchu?\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders again, glancing eloquently in my direction.\n\nSmith walked to the door.\n\n\"I must make out my report, Petrie,\" he said.  \"Look after the\nprisoner.\"\n\nAnd as the door closed softly behind him I knew what was expected of\nme; but, honestly, I shirked my responsibility.  What attitude should I\nadopt?  How should I go about my delicate task?  In a quandary, I stood\nwatching the girl whom singular circumstances saw captive in my rooms.\n\n\"You do not think we would harm you?\" I began awkwardly.  \"No harm\nshall come to you.  Why will you not trust us?\"\n\nShe raised her brilliant eyes.\n\n\"Of what avail has your protection been to some of those others,\" she\nsaid; \"those others whom HE has sought for?\"\n\nAlas!  it had been of none, and I knew it well.  I thought I grasped\nthe drift of her words.\n\n\"You mean that if you speak, Fu-Manchu will find a way of killing you?\"\n\n\"Of killing ME!\" she flashed scornfully.  \"Do I seem one to fear for\nmyself?\"\n\n\"Then what do you fear?\" I asked, in surprise.\n\nShe looked at me oddly.\n\n\"When I was seized and sold for a slave,\" she answered slowly, \"my\nsister was taken, too, and my brother--a child.\" She spoke the word\nwith a tender intonation, and her slight accent rendered it the more\nsoft.  \"My sister died in the desert.  My brother lived.  Better, far\nbetter, that he had died, too.\"\n\nHer words impressed me intensely.\n\n\"Of what are you speaking?\" I questioned.  \"You speak of slave-raids,\nof the desert.  Where did these things take place?  Of what country are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\" she questioned in turn.  \"Of what country am I?  A\nslave has no country, no name.\"\n\n\"No name!\" I cried.\n\n\"You may call me Karamaneh,\" she said.  \"As Karamaneh I was sold to Dr.\nFu-Manchu, and my brother also he purchased.  We were cheap at the\nprice he paid.\"  She laughed shortly, wildly.\n\n\"But he has spent a lot of money to educate me.  My brother is all that\nis left to me in the world to love, and he is in the power of Dr.\nFu-Manchu. You understand?  It is upon him the blow will fall.  You ask\nme to fight against Fu-Manchu. You talk of protection.  Did your\nprotection save Sir Crichton Davey?\"\n\nI shook my head sadly.\n\n\"You understand now why I cannot disobey my master's orders--why, if I\nwould, I dare not betray him.\"\n\nI walked to the window and looked out.  How could I answer her\narguments?  What could I say?  I heard the rustle of her ragged skirts,\nand she who called herself Karamaneh stood beside me.  She laid her\nhand upon my arm.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she pleaded.  \"He will kill him!  He will kill him!\"\n\nHer voice shook with emotion.\n\n\"He cannot revenge himself upon your brother when you are in no way to\nblame,\" I said angrily.  \"We arrested you; you are not here of your own\nfree will.\"\n\nShe drew her breath sharply, clutching at my arm, and in her eyes I\ncould read that she was forcing her mind to some arduous decision.\n\n\"Listen.\"  She was speaking rapidly, nervously.  \"If I help you to take\nDr. Fu-Manchu--tell you where he is to be found ALONE--will you promise\nme, solemnly promise me, that you will immediately go to the place\nwhere I shall guide you and release my brother; that you will let us\nboth go free?\"\n\n\"I will,\" I said, without hesitation.  \"You may rest assured of it.\"\n\n\"But there is a condition,\" she added.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"When I have told you where to capture him you must release me.\"\n\nI hesitated.  Smith often had accused me of weakness where this girl\nwas concerned.  What now was my plain duty?  That she would utterly\ndecline to speak under any circumstances unless it suited her to do so\nI felt assured.  If she spoke the truth, in her proposed bargain there\nwas no personal element; her conduct I now viewed in a new light.\nHumanity, I thought, dictated that I accept her proposal; policy also.\n\n\"I agree,\" I said, and looked into her eyes, which were aflame now with\nemotion, an excitement perhaps of anticipation, perhaps of fear.\n\nShe laid her hands upon my shoulders.\n\n\"You will be careful?\" she said pleadingly.\n\n\"For your sake,\" I replied, \"I shall.\"\n\n\"Not for my sake.\"\n\n\"Then for your brother's.\"\n\n\"No.\" Her voice had sunk to a whisper.  \"For your own.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nA COOL breeze met us, blowing from the lower reaches of the Thames.\nFar behind us twinkled the dim lights of Low's Cottages, the last\nregular habitations abutting upon the marshes.  Between us and the\ncottages stretched half-a-mile of lush land through which at this\nseason there were, however, numerous dry paths.  Before us the flats\nagain, a dull, monotonous expanse beneath the moon, with the promise of\nthe cool breeze that the river flowed round the bend ahead.  It was\nvery quiet.  Only the sound of our footsteps, as Nayland Smith and I\ntramped steadily towards our goal, broke the stillness of that lonely\nplace.\n\nNot once but many times, within the last twenty minutes, I had thought\nthat we were ill-advised to adventure alone upon the capture of the\nformidable Chinese doctor; but we were following out our compact with\nKaramaneh; and one of her stipulations had been that the police must\nnot be acquainted with her share in the matter.\n\nA light came into view far ahead of us.\n\n\"That's the light, Petrie,\" said Smith.  \"If we keep that straight\nbefore us, according to our information we shall strike the hulk.\"\n\nI grasped the revolver in my pocket, and the presence of the little\nweapon was curiously reassuring.  I have endeavored, perhaps in\nextenuation of my own fears, to explain how about Dr. Fu-Manchu there\nrested an atmosphere of horror, peculiar, unique.  He was not as other\nmen.  The dread that he inspired in all with whom he came in contact,\nthe terrors which he controlled and hurled at whomsoever cumbered his\npath, rendered him an object supremely sinister.  I despair of\nconveying to those who may read this account any but the coldest\nconception of the man's evil power.\n\nSmith stopped suddenly and grasped my arm.  We stood listening.\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"You heard nothing?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\nSmith was peering back over the marshes in his oddly alert way.  He\nturned to me, and his tanned face wore a peculiar expression.\n\n\"You don't think it's a trap?\" he jerked.  \"We are trusting her\nblindly.\"\n\nStrange it may seem, but something within me rose in arms against the\ninnuendo.\n\n\"I don't,\" I said shortly.\n\nHe nodded.  We pressed on.\n\nTen minutes' steady tramping brought us within sight of the Thames.\nSmith and I both had noticed how Fu-Manchu's activities centered always\nabout the London river.  Undoubtedly it was his highway, his line of\ncommunication, along which he moved his mysterious forces.  The opium\nden off Shadwell Highway, the mansion upstream, at that hour a\nsmoldering shell; now the hulk lying off the marshes.  Always he made\nhis headquarters upon the river.  It was significant; and even if\nto-night's expedition should fail, this was a clew for our future\nguidance.\n\n\"Bear to the right,\" directed Smith.  \"We must reconnoiter before\nmaking our attack.\"\n\nWe took a path that led directly to the river bank.  Before us lay the\ngray expanse of water, and out upon it moved the busy shipping of the\ngreat mercantile city.  But this life of the river seemed widely\nremoved from us.  The lonely spot where we stood had no kinship with\nhuman activity.  Its dreariness illuminated by the brilliant moon, it\nlooked indeed a fit setting for an act in such a drama as that wherein\nwe played our parts.  When I had lain in the East End opium den, when\nupon such another night as this I had looked out upon a peaceful\nNorfolk countryside, the same knowledge of aloofness, of utter\ndetachment from the world of living men, had come to me.\n\nSilently Smith stared out at the distant moving lights.\n\n\"Karamaneh merely means a slave,\" he said irrelevantly.\n\nI made no comment.\n\n\"There's the hulk,\" he added.\n\nThe bank upon which we stood dipped in mud slopes to the level of the\nrunning tide.  Seaward it rose higher, and by a narrow inlet--for we\nperceived that we were upon a kind of promontory--a rough pier showed.\nBeneath it was a shadowy shape in the patch of gloom which the moon\nthrew far out upon the softly eddying water.  Only one dim light was\nvisible amid this darkness.\n\n\"That will be the cabin,\" said Smith.\n\nActing upon our prearranged plan, we turned and walked up on to the\nstaging above the hulk.  A wooden ladder led out and down to the deck\nbelow, and was loosely lashed to a ring on the pier.  With every motion\nof the tidal waters the ladder rose and fell, its rings creaking\nharshly, against the crazy railing.\n\n\"How are we going to get down without being detected?\" whispered Smith.\n\n\"We've got to risk it,\" I said grimly.\n\nWithout further words my friend climbed around on to the ladder and\ncommenced to descend.  I waited until his head disappeared below the\nlevel, and, clumsily enough, prepared to follow him.\n\nThe hulk at that moment giving an unusually heavy heave, I stumbled,\nand for one breathless moment looked down upon the glittering surface\nstreaking the darkness beneath me.  My foot had slipped, and but that I\nhad a firm grip upon the top rung, that instant, most probably, had\nmarked the end of my share in the fight with Fu-Manchu. As it was I had\na narrow escape.  I felt something slip from my hip pocket, but the\nweird creaking of the ladder, the groans of the laboring hulk, and the\nlapping of the waves about the staging drowned the sound of the splash\nas my revolver dropped into the river.\n\nRather white-faced, I think, I joined Smith on the deck.  He had\nwitnessed my accident, but--\n\n\"We must risk it,\" he whispered in my ear.  \"We dare not turn back now.\"\n\nHe plunged into the semi-darkness, making for the cabin, I perforce\nfollowing.\n\nAt the bottom of the ladder we came fully into the light streaming out\nfrom the singular apartments at the entrance to which we found\nourselves.  It was fitted up as a laboratory.  A glimpse I had of\nshelves loaded with jars and bottles, of a table strewn with scientific\nparaphernalia, with retorts, with tubes of extraordinary shapes,\nholding living organisms, and with instruments--some of them of a form\nunknown to my experience.  I saw too that books, papers and rolls of\nparchment littered the bare wooden floor.  Then Smith's voice rose\nabove the confused sounds about me, incisive, commanding:\n\n\"I have you covered, Dr. Fu-Manchu!\"\n\nFor Fu-Manchu sat at the table.\n\nThe picture that he presented at that moment is one which persistently\nclings in my memory.  In his long, yellow robe, his masklike,\nintellectual face bent forward amongst the riot of singular objects\nupon the table, his great, high brow gleaming in the light of the\nshaded lamp above him, and with the abnormal eyes, filmed and green,\nraised to us, he seemed a figure from the realms of delirium.  But,\nmost amazing circumstance of all, he and his surroundings tallied,\nalmost identically, with the dream-picture which had come to me as I\nlay chained in the cell!\n\nSome of the large jars about the place held anatomy specimens.  A faint\nsmell of opium hung in the air, and playing with the tassel of one of\nthe cushions upon which, as upon a divan, Fu-Manchu was seated, leaped\nand chattered a little marmoset.\n\nThat was an electric moment.  I was prepared for anything--for anything\nexcept for what really happened.\n\nThe doctor's wonderful, evil face betrayed no hint of emotion.  The\nlids flickered over the filmed eyes, and their greenness grew\nmomentarily brighter, and filmed over again.\n\n\"Put up your hands!\" rapped Smith, \"and attempt no tricks.\" His voice\nquivered with excitement.  \"The game's up, Fu-Manchu. Find something to\ntie him up with, Petrie.\"\n\nI moved forward to Smith's side, and was about to pass him in the\nnarrow doorway.  The hulk moved beneath our feet like a living thing\ngroaning, creaking--and the water lapped about the rotten woodwork with\na sound infinitely dreary.\n\n\"Put up your hands!\" ordered Smith imperatively.\n\nFu-Manchu slowly raised his hands, and a smile dawned upon the\nimpassive features--a smile that had no mirth in it, only menace,\nrevealing as it did his even, discolored teeth, but leaving the filmed\neyes inanimate, dull, inhuman.\n\nHe spoke softly, sibilantly.\n\n\"I would advise Dr. Petrie to glance behind him before he moves.\"\n\nSmith's keen gray eyes never for a moment quitted the speaker.  The\ngleaming barrel moved not a hair's-breadth. But I glanced quickly over\nmy shoulder--and stifled a cry of pure horror.\n\nA wicked, pock-marked face, with wolfish fangs bared, and jaundiced\neyes squinting obliquely into mine, was within two inches of me.  A\nlean, brown hand and arm, the great thews standing up like cords, held\na crescent-shaped knife a fraction of an inch above my jugular vein.  A\nslight movement must have dispatched me; a sweep of the fearful weapon,\nI doubt not, would have severed my head from my body.\n\n\"Smith!\" I whispered hoarsely, \"don't look around.  For God's sake keep\nhim covered.  But a dacoit has his knife at my throat!\"\n\nThen, for the first time, Smith's hand trembled.  But his glance never\nwavered from the malignant, emotionless countenance of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\nHe clenched his teeth hard, so that the muscles stood out prominently\nupon his jaw.\n\nI suppose that silence which followed my awful discovery prevailed but\na few seconds.  To me those seconds were each a lingering death.\n\nThere, below, in that groaning hulk, I knew more of icy terror than any\nof our meetings with the murder-group had brought to me before; and\nthrough my brain throbbed a thought: the girl had betrayed us!\n\n\"You supposed that I was alone?\" suggested Fu-Manchu. \"So I was.\"\n\nYet no trace of fear had broken through the impassive yellow mask when\nwe had entered.\n\n\"But my faithful servant followed you,\" he added.  \"I thank him.  The\nhonors, Mr. Smith, are mine, I think?\"\n\nSmith made no reply.  I divined that he was thinking furiously.\nFu-Manchu moved his hand to caress the marmoset, which had leaped\nplayfully upon his shoulder, and crouched there gibing at us in a\nwhistling voice.\n\n\"Don't stir!\" said Smith savagely.  \"I warn you!\"\n\nFu-Manchu kept his hand raised.\n\n\"May I ask you how you discovered my retreat?\" he asked.\n\n\"This hulk has been watched since dawn,\" lied Smith brazenly.\n\n\"So?\"  The Doctor's filmed eyes cleared for a moment.  \"And to-day you\ncompelled me to burn a house, and you have captured one of my people,\ntoo.  I congratulate you.  She would not betray me though lashed with\nscorpions.\"\n\nThe great gleaming knife was so near to my neck that a sheet of\nnotepaper could scarcely have been slipped between blade and vein, I\nthink; but my heart throbbed even more wildly when I heard those words.\n\n\"An impasse,\" said Fu-Manchu. \"I have a proposal to make.  I assume\nthat you would not accept my word for anything?\"\n\n\"I would not,\" replied Smith promptly.\n\n\"Therefore,\" pursued the Chinaman, and the occasional guttural alone\nmarred his perfect English, \"I must accept yours.  Of your resources\noutside this cabin I know nothing.  You, I take it, know as little of\nmine.  My Burmese friend and Doctor Petrie will lead the way, then; you\nand I will follow.  We will strike out across the marsh for, say, three\nhundred yards.  You will then place your pistol on the ground, pledging\nme your word to leave it there.  I shall further require your assurance\nthat you will make no attempt upon me until I have retraced my steps.\nI and my good servant will withdraw, leaving you, at the expiration of\nthe specified period, to act as you see fit.  Is it agreed?\"\n\nSmith hesitated.  Then:\n\n\"The dacoit must leave his knife also,\" he stipulated.  Fu-Manchu\nsmiled his evil smile again.\n\n\"Agreed.  Shall I lead the way?\"\n\n\"No!\" rapped Smith.  \"Petrie and the dacoit first; then you; I last.\"\n\nA guttural word of command from Fu-Manchu, and we left the cabin, with\nits evil odors, its mortuary specimens, and its strange instruments,\nand in the order arranged mounted to the deck.\n\n\"It will be awkward on the ladder,\" said Fu-Manchu. \"Dr. Petrie, I will\naccept your word to adhere to the terms.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" I said, the words almost choking me.\n\nWe mounted the rising and dipping ladder, all reached the pier, and\nstrode out across the flats, the Chinaman always under close cover of\nSmith's revolver.  Round about our feet, now leaping ahead, now\ngamboling back, came and went the marmoset.  The dacoit, dressed solely\nin a dark loin-cloth, walked beside me, carrying his huge knife, and\nsometimes glancing at me with his blood-lustful eyes.  Never before, I\nventure to say, had an autumn moon lighted such a scene in that place.\n\n\"Here we part,\" said Fu-Manchu, and spoke another word to his follower.\n\nThe man threw his knife upon the ground.\n\n\"Search him, Petrie,\" directed Smith.  \"He may have a second concealed.\"\n\nThe Doctor consented; and I passed my hands over the man's scanty\ngarments.\n\n\"Now search Fu-Manchu.\"\n\nThis also I did.  And never have I experienced a similar sense of\nrevulsion from any human being.  I shuddered, as though I had touched a\nvenomous reptile.\n\nSmith threw down his revolver.\n\n\"I curse myself for an honorable fool,\" he said.  \"No one could dispute\nmy right to shoot you dead where you stand.\"\n\nKnowing him as I did, I could tell from the suppressed passion in\nSmith's voice that only by his unhesitating acceptance of my friend's\nword, and implicit faith in his keeping it, had Dr. Fu-Manchu escaped\njust retribution at that moment.  Fiend though he was, I admired his\ncourage; for all this he, too, must have known.\n\nThe Doctor turned, and with the dacoit walked back.  Nayland Smith's\nnext move filled me with surprise.  For just as, silently, I was\nthanking God for my escape, my friend began shedding his coat, collar,\nand waistcoat.\n\n\"Pocket your valuables, and do the same,\" he muttered hoarsely.  \"We\nhave a poor chance but we are both fairly fit.  To-night, Petrie, we\nliterally have to run for our lives.\"\n\nWe live in a peaceful age, wherein it falls to the lot of few men to\nowe their survival to their fleetness of foot.  At Smith's words I\nrealized in a flash that such was to be our fate to-night.\n\nI have said that the hulk lay off a sort of promontory.  East and west,\nthen, we had nothing to hope for.  To the south was Fu-Manchu; and even\nas, stripped of our heavier garments, we started to run northward, the\nweird signal of a dacoit rose on the night and was answered--was\nanswered again.\n\n\"Three, at least,\" hissed Smith; \"three armed dacoits.  Hopeless.\"\n\n\"Take the revolver,\" I cried.  \"Smith, it's--\"\n\n\"No,\" he rapped, through clenched teeth.  \"A servant of the Crown in\nthe East makes his motto:  'Keep your word, though it break your neck!'\nI don't think we need fear it being used against us.  Fu-Manchu avoids\nnoisy methods.\"\n\nSo back we ran, over the course by which, earlier, we had come.  It\nwas, roughly, a mile to the first building--a deserted cottage--and\nanother quarter of a mile to any that was occupied.\n\nOur chance of meeting a living soul, other than Fu-Manchu's dacoits,\nwas practically nil.\n\nAt first we ran easily, for it was the second half-mile that would\ndecide our fate.  The professional murderers who pursued us ran like\npanthers, I knew; and I dare not allow my mind to dwell upon those\nyellow figures with the curved, gleaming knives.  For a long time\nneither of us looked back.\n\nOn we ran, and on--silently, doggedly.\n\nThen a hissing breath from Smith warned me what to expect.\n\nShould I, too, look back?  Yes.  It was impossible to resist the horrid\nfascination.\n\nI threw a quick glance over my shoulder.\n\nAnd never while I live shall I forget what I saw.  Two of the pursuing\ndacoits had outdistanced their fellow (or fellows), and were actually\nwithin three hundred yards of us.\n\nMore like dreadful animals they looked than human beings, running bent\nforward, with their faces curiously uptilted.  The brilliant moonlight\ngleamed upon bared teeth, as I could see, even at that distance, even\nin that quick, agonized glance, and it gleamed upon the crescent-shaped\nknives.\n\n\"As hard as you can go now,\" panted Smith.  \"We must make an attempt to\nbreak into the empty cottage.  Only chance.\"\n\nI had never in my younger days been a notable runner; for Smith I\ncannot speak.  But I am confident that the next half-mile was done in\ntime that would not have disgraced a crack man.  Not once again did\neither of us look back.  Yard upon yard we raced forward together.  My\nheart seemed to be bursting.  My leg muscles throbbed with pain.  At\nlast, with the empty cottage in sight, it came to that pass with me\nwhen another three yards looks as unattainable as three miles.  Once I\nstumbled.\n\n\"My God!\" came from Smith weakly.\n\nBut I recovered myself.  Bare feet pattered close upon our heels, and\npanting breaths told how even Fu-Manchu's bloodhounds were hard put to\nit by the killing pace we had made.\n\n\"Smith,\" I whispered, \"look in front.  Someone!\"\n\nAs through a red mist I had seen a dark shape detach itself from the\nshadows of the cottage, and merge into them again.  It could only be\nanother dacoit; but Smith, not heeding, or not hearing, my faintly\nwhispered words, crashed open the gate and hurled himself blindly at\nthe door.\n\nIt burst open before him with a resounding boom, and he pitched forward\ninto the interior darkness.  Flat upon the floor he lay, for as, with a\nlast effort, I gained the threshold and dragged myself within, I almost\nfell over his recumbent body.\n\nMadly I snatched at the door.  His foot held it open.  I kicked the\nfoot away, and banged the door to.  As I turned, the leading dacoit,\nhis eyes starting from their sockets, his face the face of a demon\nleaped wildly through the gateway.\n\nThat Smith had burst the latch I felt assured, but by some divine\naccident my weak hands found the bolt.  With the last ounce of strength\nspared to me I thrust it home in the rusty socket--as a full six inches\nof shining steel split the middle panel and protruded above my head.\n\nI dropped, sprawling, beside my friend.\n\nA terrific blow shattered every pane of glass in the solitary window,\nand one of the grinning animal faces looked in.\n\n\"Sorry, old man,\" whispered Smith, and his voice was barely audible.\nWeakly he grasped my hand.  \"My fault.  I shouldn't have let you come.\"\n\nFrom the corner of the room where the black shadows lay flicked a long\ntongue of flame.  Muffled, staccato, came the report.  And the yellow\nface at the window was blotted out.\n\nOne wild cry, ending in a rattling gasp, told of a dacoit gone to his\naccount.\n\nA gray figure glided past me and was silhouetted against the broken\nwindow.\n\nAgain the pistol sent its message into the night, and again came the\nreply to tell how well and truly that message had been delivered.  In\nthe stillness, intense by sharp contrast, the sound of bare soles\npattering upon the path outside stole to me.  Two runners, I thought\nthere were, so that four dacoits must have been upon our trail.  The\nroom was full of pungent smoke.  I staggered to my feet as the gray\nfigure with the revolver turned towards me.  Something familiar there\nwas in that long, gray garment, and now I perceived why I had thought\nso.\n\nIt was my gray rain-coat.\n\n\"Karamaneh,\" I whispered.\n\nAnd Smith, with difficulty, supporting himself upright, and holding\nfast to the ledge beside the door, muttered something hoarsely, which\nsounded like \"God bless her!\"\n\nThe girl, trembling now, placed her hands upon my shoulders with that\nquaint, pathetic gesture peculiarly her own.\n\n\"I followed you,\" she said.  \"Did you not know I should follow you?\nBut I had to hide because of another who was following also.  I had but\njust reached this place when I saw you running towards me.\"\n\nShe broke off and turned to Smith.\n\n\"This is your pistol,\" she said naively.  \"I found it in your bag.\nWill you please take it!\"\n\nHe took it without a word.  Perhaps he could not trust himself to speak.\n\n\"Now go.  Hurry!\" she said.  \"You are not safe yet.\"\n\n\"But you?\" I asked.\n\n\"You have failed,\" she replied.  \"I must go back to him.  There is no\nother way.\"\n\nStrangely sick at heart for a man who has just had a miraculous escape\nfrom death, I opened the door.  Coatless, disheveled figures, my friend\nand I stepped out into the moonlight.\n\nHideous under the pale rays lay the two dead men, their glazed eyes\nupcast to the peace of the blue heavens.  Karamaneh had shot to kill,\nfor both had bullets in their brains.  If God ever planned a more\ncomplex nature than hers--a nature more tumultuous with conflicting\npassions, I cannot conceive of it.  Yet her beauty was of the sweetest;\nand in some respects she had the heart of a child--this girl who could\nshoot so straight.\n\n\"We must send the police to-night,\" said Smith.  \"Or the papers--\"\n\n\"Hurry,\" came the girl's voice commandingly from the darkness of the\ncottage.\n\nIt was a singular situation.  My very soul rebelled against it.  But\nwhat could we do?\n\n\"Tell us where we can communicate,\" began Smith.\n\n\"Hurry.  I shall be suspected.  Do you want him to kill me!\"\n\nWe moved away.  All was very still now, and the lights glimmered\nfaintly ahead.  Not a wisp of cloud brushed the moon's disk.\n\n\"Good-night, Karamaneh,\" I whispered softly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nTO pursue further the adventure on the marshes would be a task at once\nuseless and thankless.  In its actual and in its dramatic significance\nit concluded with our parting from Karamaneh.  And in that parting I\nlearned what Shakespeare meant by \"Sweet Sorrow.\"\n\nThere was a world, I learned, upon the confines of which I stood, a\nworld whose very existence hitherto had been unsuspected.  Not the\nleast of the mysteries which peeped from the darkness was the mystery\nof the heart of Karamaneh.  I sought to forget her.  I sought to\nremember her.  Indeed, in the latter task I found one more congenial,\nyet, in the direction and extent of the ideas which it engendered, one\nthat led me to a precipice.\n\nEast and West may not intermingle.  As a student of world-policies, as\na physician, I admitted, could not deny, that truth.  Again, if\nKaramaneh were to be credited, she had come to Fu-Manchu a slave; had\nfallen into the hands of the raiders; had crossed the desert with the\nslave-drivers; had known the house of the slave-dealer. Could it be?\nWith the fading of the crescent of Islam I had thought such things to\nhave passed.\n\nBut if it were so?\n\nAt the mere thought of a girl so deliciously beautiful in the brutal\npower of slavers, I found myself grinding my teeth--closing my eyes in\na futile attempt to blot out the pictures called up.\n\nThen, at such times, I would find myself discrediting her story.\nAgain, I would find myself wondering, vaguely, why such problems\npersistently haunted my mind.  But, always, my heart had an answer.\nAnd I was a medical man, who sought to build up a family\npractice!--who, in short, a very little time ago, had thought himself\npast the hot follies of youth and entered upon that staid phase of life\nwherein the daily problems of the medical profession hold absolute sway\nand such seductive follies as dark eyes and red lips find--no\nplace--are excluded!\n\nBut it is foreign from the purpose of this plain record to enlist\nsympathy for the recorder.  The topic upon which, here, I have ventured\nto touch was one fascinating enough to me; I cannot hope that it holds\nequal charm for any other.  Let us return to that which it is my duty\nto narrate and let us forget my brief digression.\n\nIt is a fact, singular, but true, that few Londoners know London.\nUnder the guidance of my friend, Nayland Smith, I had learned, since\nhis return from Burma, how there are haunts in the very heart of the\nmetropolis whose existence is unsuspected by all but the few; places\nunknown even to the ubiquitous copy-hunting pressman.\n\nInto a quiet thoroughfare not two minutes' walk from the pulsing life\nof Leicester Square, Smith led the way.  Before a door sandwiched in\nbetween two dingy shop-fronts he paused and turned to me.\n\n\"Whatever you see or hear,\" he cautioned, \"express no surprise.\"\n\nA cab had dropped us at the corner.  We both wore dark suits and fez\ncaps with black silk tassels.  My complexion had been artificially\nreduced to a shade resembling the deep tan of my friend's. He rang the\nbell beside the door.\n\nAlmost immediately it was opened by a negro woman--gross, hideously\nugly.\n\nSmith uttered something in voluble Arabic.  As a linguist his\nattainments were a constant source of surprise.  The jargons of the\nEast, Far and Near, he spoke as his mother tongue.  The woman\nimmediately displayed the utmost servility, ushering us into an\nill-lighted passage, with every evidence of profound respect.\nFollowing this passage, and passing an inner door, from beyond whence\nproceeded bursts of discordant music, we entered a little room bare of\nfurniture, with coarse matting for mural decorations, and a patternless\nred carpet on the floor.  In a niche burned a common metal lamp.\n\nThe negress left us, and close upon her departure entered a very aged\nman with a long patriarchal beard, who greeted my friend with dignified\ncourtesy.  Following a brief conversation, the aged Arab--for such he\nappeared to be--drew aside a strip of matting, revealing a dark recess.\nPlacing his finger upon his lips, he silently invited us to enter.\n\nWe did so, and the mat was dropped behind us.  The sounds of crude\nmusic were now much plainer, and as Smith slipped a little shutter\naside I gave a start of surprise.\n\nBeyond lay a fairly large apartment, having divans or low seats around\nthree of its walls.  These divans were occupied by a motley company of\nTurks, Egyptians, Greeks, and others; and I noted two Chinese.  Most of\nthem smoked cigarettes, and some were drinking.  A girl was performing\na sinuous dance upon the square carpet occupying the center of the\nfloor, accompanied by a young negro woman upon a guitar and by several\nmembers of the assembly who clapped their hands to the music or hummed\na low, monotonous melody.\n\nShortly after our entrance into the passage the dance terminated, and\nthe dancer fled through a curtained door at the farther end of the\nroom.  A buzz of conversation arose.\n\n\"It is a sort of combined Wekaleh and place of entertainment for a\ncertain class of Oriental residents in, or visiting, London,\" Smith\nwhispered.  \"The old gentleman who has just left us is the proprietor\nor host.  I have been here before on several occasions, but have always\ndrawn blank.\"\n\nHe was peering out eagerly into the strange clubroom.\n\n\"Whom do you expect to find here?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is a recognized meeting-place,\" said Smith in my ear.  \"It is\nalmost a certainty that some of the Fu-Manchu group use it at times.\"\n\nCuriously I surveyed all these faces which were visible from the\nspy-hole.  My eyes rested particularly upon the two Chinamen.\n\n\"Do you recognize anyone?\" I whispered.\n\n\"S-sh!\"\n\nSmith was craning his neck so as to command a sight of the doorway.  He\nobstructed my view, and only by his tense attitude and some subtle wave\nof excitement which he communicated to me did I know that a new arrival\nwas entering.  The hum of conversation died away, and in the ensuing\nsilence I heard the rustle of draperies.  The newcomer was a woman,\nthen.  Fearful of making any noise I yet managed to get my eyes to the\nlevel of the shutter.\n\nA woman in an elegant, flame-colored opera cloak was crossing the floor\nand coming in the direction of the spot where we were concealed.  She\nwore a soft silk scarf about her head, a fold partly draped across her\nface.  A momentary view I had of her--and wildly incongruous she looked\nin that place--and she had disappeared from sight, having approached\nsomeone invisible who sat upon the divan immediately beneath our point\nof vantage.\n\nFrom the way in which the company gazed towards her, I divined that she\nwas no habitue of the place, but that her presence there was as greatly\nsurprising to those in the room as it was to me.\n\nWhom could she be, this elegant lady who visited such a haunt--who, it\nwould seem, was so anxious to disguise her identity, but who was\ndressed for a society function rather than for a midnight expedition of\nso unusual a character?\n\nI began a whispered question, but Smith tugged at my arm to silence me.\nHis excitement was intense.  Had his keener powers enabled him to\nrecognize the unknown?\n\nA faint but most peculiar perfume stole to my nostrils, a perfume which\nseemed to contain the very soul of Eastern mystery.  Only one woman\nknown to me used that perfume--Karamaneh.\n\nThen it was she!\n\nAt last my friend's vigilance had been rewarded.  Eagerly I bent\nforward.  Smith literally quivered in anticipation of a discovery.\nAgain the strange perfume was wafted to our hiding-place; and, glancing\nneither to right nor left, I saw Karamaneh--for that it was she I no\nlonger doubted--recross the room and disappear.\n\n\"The man she spoke to,\" hissed Smith.  \"We must see him!  We must have\nhim!\"\n\nHe pulled the mat aside and stepped out into the anteroom.  It was\nempty.  Down the passage he led, and we were almost come to the door of\nthe big room when it was thrown open and a man came rapidly out, opened\nthe street door before Smith could reach him, and was gone, slamming it\nfast.\n\nI can swear that we were not four seconds behind him, but when we\ngained the street it was empty.  Our quarry had disappeared as if by\nmagic.  A big car was just turning the corner towards Leicester Square.\n\n\"That is the girl,\" rapped Smith; \"but where in Heaven's name is the\nman to whom she brought the message?  I would give a hundred pounds to\nknow what business is afoot.  To think that we have had such an\nopportunity and have thrown it away!\"\n\nAngry and nonplused he stood at the corner, looking in the direction of\nthe crowded thoroughfare into which the car had been driven, tugging at\nthe lobe of his ear, as was his habit in such moments of perplexity,\nand sharply clicking his teeth together.  I, too, was very thoughtful.\nClews were few enough in those days of our war with that giant\nantagonist.  The mere thought that our trifling error of judgment\ntonight in tarrying a moment too long might mean the victory of\nFu-Manchu, might mean the turning of the balance which a wise\nprovidence had adjusted between the white and yellow races, was\nappalling.\n\nTo Smith and me, who knew something of the secret influences at work to\noverthrow the Indian Empire, to place, it might be, the whole of Europe\nand America beneath an Eastern rule, it seemed that a great yellow hand\nwas stretched out over London.  Doctor Fu-Manchu was a menace to the\ncivilized world.  Yet his very existence remained unsuspected by the\nmillions whose fate he sought to command.\n\n\"Into what dark scheme have we had a glimpse?\" said Smith.  \"What State\nsecret is to be filched?  What faithful servant of the British Raj to\nbe spirited away?  Upon whom now has Fu-Manchu set his death seal?\"\n\n\"Karamaneh on this occasion may not have been acting as an emissary of\nthe Doctor's.\"\n\n\"I feel assured that she was, Petrie.  Of the many whom this yellow\ncloud may at any moment envelop, to which one did her message refer?\nThe man's instructions were urgent.  Witness his hasty departure.\nCurse it!\"  He dashed his right clenched fist into the palm of his left\nhand.  \"I never had a glimpse of his face, first to last.  To think of\nthe hours I have spent in that place, in anticipation of just such a\nmeeting--only to bungle the opportunity when it arose!\" Scarce heeding\nwhat course we followed, we had come now to Piccadilly Circus, and had\nwalked out into the heart of the night's traffic.  I just dragged Smith\naside in time to save him from the off-front wheel of a big Mercedes.\nThen the traffic was blocked, and we found ourselves dangerously penned\nin amidst the press of vehicles.\n\nSomehow we extricated ourselves, jeered at by taxi-drivers, who\nnaturally took us for two simple Oriental visitors, and just before\nthat impassable barrier the arm of a London policeman was lowered and\nthe stream moved on a faint breath of perfume became perceptible to me.\n\nThe cabs and cars about us were actually beginning to move again, and\nthere was nothing for it but a hasty retreat to the curb.  I could not\npause to glance behind, but instinctively I knew that someone--someone\nwho used that rare, fragrant essence--was leaning from the window of\nthe car.\n\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND!\" floated a soft whisper.\n\nWe gained the pavement as the pent-up traffic roared upon its way.\n\nSmith had not noticed the perfume worn by the unseen occupant of the\ncar, had not detected the whispered words.  But I had no reason to\ndoubt my senses, and I knew beyond question that Fu-Manchu's lovely\nslave, Karamaneh, had been within a yard of us, had recognized us, and\nhad uttered those words for our guidance.\n\nOn regaining my rooms, we devoted a whole hour to considering what\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND\" could possibly mean.\n\n\"Hang it all!\" cried Smith, \"it might mean anything--the result of a\nrace, for instance.\"\n\nHe burst into one of his rare laughs, and began to stuff broadcut\nmixture into his briar.  I could see that he had no intention of\nturning in.\n\n\"I can think of no one--no one of note--in London at present upon whom\nit is likely that Fu-Manchu would make an attempt,\" he said, \"except\nourselves.\"\n\nWe began methodically to go through the long list of names which we had\ncompiled and to review our elaborate notes.  When, at last, I turned\nin, the night had given place to a new day.  But sleep evaded me, and\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND\" danced like a mocking phantom through my brain.\n\nThen I heard the telephone bell.  I heard Smith speaking.\n\nA minute afterwards he was in my room, his face very grim.\n\n\"I knew as well as if I'd seen it with my own eyes that some black\nbusiness was afoot last night,\" he said.  \"And it was.  Within\npistol-shot of us!  Someone has got at Frank Norris West.  Inspector\nWeymouth has just been on the 'phone.\"\n\n\"Norris West!\" I cried, \"the American aviator--and inventor--\"\n\n\"Of the West aero-torpedo--yes.  He's been offering it to the English\nWar Office, and they have delayed too long.\"\n\nI got out of bed.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that the potentialities have attracted the attention of Dr.\nFu-Manchu!\"\n\nThose words operated electrically.  I do not know how long I was in\ndressing, how long a time elapsed ere the cab for which Smith had\n'phoned arrived, how many precious minutes were lost upon the journey;\nbut, in a nervous whirl, these things slipped into the past, like the\ntelegraph poles seen from the window of an express, and, still in that\ntense state, we came upon the scene of this newest outrage.\n\nMr. Norris West, whose lean, stoic face had latterly figured so often\nin the daily press, lay upon the floor in the little entrance hall of\nhis chambers, flat upon his back, with the telephone receiver in his\nhand.\n\nThe outer door had been forced by the police.  They had had to remove a\npiece of the paneling to get at the bolt.  A medical man was leaning\nover the recumbent figure in the striped pajama suit, and\nDetective-Inspector Weymouth stood watching him as Smith and I entered.\n\n\"He has been heavily drugged,\" said the Doctor, sniffing at West's\nlips, \"but I cannot say what drug has been used.  It isn't chloroform\nor anything of that nature.  He can safely be left to sleep it off, I\nthink.\"\n\nI agreed, after a brief examination.\n\n\"It's most extraordinary,\" said Weymouth.  \"He rang up the Yard about\nan hour ago and said his chambers had been invaded by Chinamen.  Then\nthe man at the 'phone plainly heard him fall.  When we got here his\nfront door was bolted, as you've seen, and the windows are three floors\nup.  Nothing is disturbed.\"\n\n\"The plans of the aero-torpedo?\" rapped Smith.\n\n\"I take it they are in the safe in his bedroom,\" replied the detective,\n\"and that is locked all right.  I think he must have taken an overdose\nof something and had illusions.  But in case there was anything in what\nhe mumbled (you could hardly understand him) I thought it as well to\nsend for you.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Smith rapidly.  His eyes shone like steel.  \"Lay\nhim on the bed, Inspector.\"\n\nIt was done, and my friend walked into the bedroom.\n\nSave that the bed was disordered, showing that West had been sleeping\nin it, there were no evidences of the extraordinary invasion mentioned\nby the drugged man.  It was a small room--the chambers were of that\nkind which are let furnished--and very neat.  A safe with a combination\nlock stood in a corner.  The window was open about a foot at the top.\nSmith tried the safe and found it fast.  He stood for a moment clicking\nhis teeth together, by which I knew him to be perplexed.  He walked\nover to the window and threw it up.  We both looked out.\n\n\"You see,\" came Weymouth's voice, \"it is altogether too far from the\ncourt below for our cunning Chinese friends to have fixed a ladder with\none of their bamboo rod arrangements.  And, even if they could get up\nthere, it's too far down from the roof--two more stories--for them to\nhave fixed it from there.\"\n\nSmith nodded thoughtfully, at the same time trying the strength of an\niron bar which ran from side to side of the window-sill. Suddenly he\nstooped, with a sharp exclamation.  Bending over his shoulder I saw\nwhat it was that had attracted his attention.\n\nClearly imprinted upon the dust-coated gray stone of the sill was a\nconfused series of marks--tracks call them what you will.\n\nSmith straightened himself and turned a wondering look upon me.\n\n\"What is it, Petrie?\" he said amazedly.  \"Some kind of bird has been\nhere, and recently.\"  Inspector Weymouth in turn examined the marks.\n\n\"I never saw bird tracks like these, Mr. Smith,\" he muttered.\n\nSmith was tugging at the lobe of his ear.\n\n\"No,\" he returned reflectively; \"come to think of it, neither did I.\"\n\nHe twisted around, looking at the man on the bed.\n\n\"Do you think it was all an illusion?\" asked the detective.\n\n\"What about those marks on the window-sill?\" jerked Smith.\n\nHe began restlessly pacing about the room, sometimes stopping before\nthe locked safe and frequently glancing at Norris West.\n\nSuddenly he walked out and briefly examined the other apartments, only\nto return again to the bedroom.\n\n\"Petrie,\" he said, \"we are losing valuable time.  West must be aroused.\"\n\nInspector Weymouth stared.\n\nSmith turned to me impatiently.  The doctor summoned by the police had\ngone.  \"Is there no means of arousing him, Petrie?\" he said.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" I replied, \"he could be revived if one but knew what drug\nhe had taken.\"\n\nMy friend began his restless pacing again, and suddenly pounced upon a\nlittle phial of tabloids which had been hidden behind some books on a\nshelf near the bed.  He uttered a triumphant exclamation.\n\n\"See what we have here, Petrie!\" he directed, handing the phial to me.\n\"It bears no label.\"\n\nI crushed one of the tabloids in my palm and applied my tongue to the\npowder.\n\n\"Some preparation of chloral hydrate,\" I pronounced.\n\n\"A sleeping draught?\" suggested Smith eagerly.\n\n\"We might try,\" I said, and scribbled a formula upon a leaf of my\nnotebook.  I asked Weymouth to send the man who accompanied him to call\nup the nearest chemist and procure the antidote.\n\nDuring the man's absence Smith stood contemplating the unconscious\ninventor, a peculiar expression upon his bronzed face.\n\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND,\" he muttered.  \"Shall we find the key to the riddle\nhere, I wonder?\"\n\nInspector Weymouth, who had concluded, I think, that the mysterious\ntelephone call was due to mental aberration on the part of Norris West,\nwas gnawing at his mustache impatiently when his assistant returned.  I\nadministered the powerful restorative, and although, as later\ntranspired, chloral was not responsible for West's condition, the\nantidote operated successfully.\n\nNorris West struggled into a sitting position, and looked about him\nwith haggard eyes.\n\n\"The Chinamen!  The Chinamen!\" he muttered.\n\nHe sprang to his feet, glaring wildly at Smith and me, reeled, and\nalmost fell.\n\n\"It is all right,\" I said, supporting him.  \"I'm a doctor.  You have\nbeen unwell.\"\n\n\"Have the police come?\" he burst out.  \"The safe--try the safe!\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Inspector Weymouth.  \"The safe is locked--unless\nsomeone else knows the combination, there's nothing to worry about.\"\n\n\"No one else knows it,\" said West, and staggered unsteadily to the\nsafe.  Clearly his mind was in a dazed condition, but, setting his jaw\nwith a curious expression of grim determination, he collected his\nthoughts and opened the safe.\n\nHe bent down, looking in.\n\nIn some way the knowledge came to me that the curtain was about to rise\non a new and surprising act in the Fu-Manchu drama.\n\n\"God!\" he whispered--we could scarcely hear him--\"the plans are gone!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nI HAVE never seen a man quite so surprised as Inspector Weymouth.\n\n\"This is absolutely incredible!\" he said.  \"There's only one door to\nyour chambers.  We found it bolted from the inside.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" groaned West, pressing his hand to his forehead.  \"I bolted it\nmyself at eleven o'clock, when I came in.\"\n\n\"No human being could climb up or down to your windows.  The plans of\nthe aero-torpedo were inside a safe.\"\n\n\"I put them there myself,\" said West, \"on returning from the War\nOffice, and I had occasion to consult them after I had come in and\nbolted the door.  I returned them to the safe and locked it.  That it\nwas still locked you saw for yourselves, and no one else in the world\nknows the combination.\"\n\n\"But the plans have gone,\" said Weymouth.  \"It's magic!  How was it\ndone?  What happened last night, sir?  What did you mean when you rang\nus up?\"\n\nSmith during this colloquy was pacing rapidly up and down the room.  He\nturned abruptly to the aviator.\n\n\"Every fact you can remember, Mr. West, please,\" he said tersely; \"and\nbe as brief as you possibly can.\"\n\n\"I came in, as I said,\" explained West, \"about eleven o'clock and\nhaving made some notes relating to an interview arranged for this\nmorning, I locked the plans in the safe and turned in.\"\n\n\"There was no one hidden anywhere in your chambers?\" snapped Smith.\n\n\"There was not,\" replied West.  \"I looked.  I invariably do.  Almost\nimmediately, I went to sleep.\"\n\n\"How many chloral tabloids did you take?\" I interrupted.\n\nNorris West turned to me with a slow smile.\n\n\"You're cute, Doctor,\" he said.  \"I took two.  It's a bad habit, but I\ncan't sleep without.  They are specially made up for me by a firm in\nPhiladelphia.\"\n\n\"How long sleep lasted, when it became filled with uncanny dreams, and\nwhen those dreams merged into reality, I do not know--shall never know,\nI suppose.  But out of the dreamless void a face came to\nme--closer--closer--and peered into mine.\n\n\"I was in that curious condition wherein one knows that one is dreaming\nand seeks to awaken--to escape.  But a nightmare-like oppression held\nme.  So I must lie and gaze into the seared yellow face that hung over\nme, for it would drop so close that I could trace the cicatrized scar\nrunning from the left ear to the corner of the mouth, and drawing up\nthe lip like the lip of a snarling cur.  I could look into the\nmalignant, jaundiced eyes; I could hear the dim whispering of the\ndistorted mouth--whispering that seemed to counsel something--something\nevil.  That whispering intimacy was indescribably repulsive.  Then the\nwicked yellow face would be withdrawn, and would recede until it became\nas a pin's head in the darkness far above me--almost like a glutinous,\nliquid thing.\n\n\"Somehow I got upon my feet, or dreamed I did--God knows where dreaming\nended and reality began.  Gentlemen maybe you'll conclude I went mad\nlast night, but as I stood holding on to the bedrail I heard the blood\nthrobbing through my arteries with a noise like a screw-propeller. I\nstarted laughing.  The laughter issued from my lips with a shrill\nwhistling sound that pierced me with physical pain and seemed to wake\nthe echoes of the whole block.  I thought myself I was going mad, and I\ntried to command my will--to break the power of the chloral--for I\nconcluded that I had accidentally taken an overdose.\n\n\"Then the walls of my bedroom started to recede, till at last I stood\nholding on to a bed which had shrunk to the size of a doll's cot, in\nthe middle of a room like Trafalgar Square!  That window yonder was\nsuch a long way off I could scarcely see it, but I could just detect a\nChinaman--the owner of the evil yellow face--creeping through it.  He\nwas followed by another, who was enormously tall--so tall that, as they\ncame towards me (and it seemed to take them something like half-an-hour\nto cross this incredible apartment in my dream), the second Chinaman\nseemed to tower over me like a cypress-tree.\n\n\"I looked up to his face--his wicked, hairless face.  Mr. Smith,\nwhatever age I live to, I'll never forget that face I saw last\nnight--or did I see it?  God knows!  The pointed chin, the great dome\nof a forehead, and the eyes--heavens above, the huge green eyes!\"\n\nHe shook like a sick man, and I glanced at Smith significantly.\nInspector Weymouth was stroking his mustache, and his mingled\nexpression of incredulity and curiosity was singular to behold.\n\n\"The pumping of my blood,\" continued West, \"seemed to be bursting my\nbody; the room kept expanding and contracting.  One time the ceiling\nwould be pressing down on my head, and the Chinamen--sometimes I\nthought there were two of them, sometimes twenty--became dwarfs; the\nnext instant it shot up like the roof of a cathedral.\n\n\"'Can I be awake,' I whispered, 'or am I dreaming?'\n\n\"My whisper went sweeping in windy echoes about the walls, and was lost\nin the shadowy distances up under the invisible roof.\n\n\"'You are dreaming--yes.'  It was the Chinaman with the green eyes who\nwas addressing me, and the words that he uttered appeared to occupy an\nimmeasurable time in the utterance.  'But at will I can render the\nsubjective objective.' I don't think I can have dreamed those singular\nwords, gentlemen.\n\n\"And then he fixed the green eyes upon me--the blazing green eyes.  I\nmade no attempt to move.  They seemed to be draining me of something\nvital--bleeding me of every drop of mental power.  The whole nightmare\nroom grew green, and I felt that I was being absorbed into its\ngreenness.\n\n\"I can see what you think.  And even in my delirium--if it was\ndelirium--I thought the same.  Now comes the climax of my\nexperience--my vision--I don't know what to call it.  I SAW some WORDS\nissuing from my own mouth!\"\n\nInspector Weymouth coughed discreetly.  Smith whisked round upon him.\n\n\"This will be outside your experience, Inspector, I know,\" he said,\n\"but Mr. Norris West's statement does not surprise me in the least.  I\nknow to what the experience was due.\"\n\nWeymouth stared incredulously, but a dawning perception of the truth\nwas come to me, too.\n\n\"How I SAW a SOUND I just won't attempt to explain; I simply tell you I\nsaw it.  Somehow I knew I had betrayed myself--given something away.\"\n\n\"You gave away the secret of the lock combination!\" rapped Smith.\n\n\"Eh!\" grunted Weymouth.\n\nBut West went on hoarsely:\n\n\"Just before the blank came a name flashed before my eyes.  It was\n'Bayard Taylor.'\"\n\nAt that I interrupted West.\n\n\"I understand!\" I cried.  \"I understand!  Another name has just\noccurred to me, Mr. West--that of the Frenchman, Moreau.\"\n\n\"You have solved the mystery,\" said Smith.  \"It was natural Mr. West\nshould have thought of the American traveler, Bayard Taylor, though.\nMoreau's book is purely scientific.  He has probably never read it.\"\n\n\"I fought with the stupor that was overcoming me,\" continued West,\n\"striving to associate that vaguely familiar name with the fantastic\nthings through which I moved.  It seemed to me that the room was empty\nagain.  I made for the hall, for the telephone.  I could scarcely drag\nmy feet along.  It seemed to take me half-an-hour to get there.  I\nremember calling up Scotland Yard, and I remember no more.\"\n\nThere was a short, tense interval.\n\nIn some respects I was nonplused; but, frankly, I think Inspector\nWeymouth considered West insane.  Smith, his hands locked behind his\nback, stared out of the window.\n\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND\" he said suddenly.  \"Weymouth, when is the first train\nto Tilbury?\"\n\n\"Five twenty-two from Fenchurch Street,\" replied the Scotland Yard man\npromptly.\n\n\"Too late!\" rapped my friend.  \"Jump in a taxi and pick up two good men\nto leave for China at once!  Then go and charter a special to Tilbury\nto leave in twenty-five minutes.  Order another cab to wait outside for\nme.\"\n\nWeymouth was palpably amazed, but Smith's tone was imperative.  The\nInspector departed hastily.\n\nI stared at Smith, not comprehending what prompted this singular course.\n\n\"Now that you can think clearly, Mr. West,\" he said, \"of what does your\nexperience remind you?  The errors of perception regarding time; the\nidea of SEEING A SOUND; the illusion that the room alternately\nincreased and diminished in size; your fit of laughter, and the\nrecollection of the name Bayard Taylor.  Since evidently you are\nfamiliar with that author's work--'The Land of the Saracen,' is it\nnot?--these symptoms of the attack should be familiar, I think.\"\n\nNorris West pressed his hands to his evidently aching head.\n\n\"Bayard Taylor's book,\" he said dully.  \"Yes! . . . I know of what my\nbrain sought to remind me--Taylor's account of his experience under\nhashish. Mr. Smith, someone doped me with hashish!\"\n\nSmith nodded grimly.\n\n\"Cannabis indica,\" I said--\"Indian hemp.  That is what you were drugged\nwith.  I have no doubt that now you experience a feeling of nausea and\nintense thirst, with aching in the muscles, particularly the deltoid.\nI think you must have taken at least fifteen grains.\"\n\nSmith stopped his perambulations immediately in front of West, looking\ninto his dulled eyes.\n\n\"Someone visited your chambers last night,\" he said slowly, \"and for\nyour chloral tabloids substituted some containing hashish, or perhaps\nnot pure hashish.  Fu-Manchu is a profound chemist.\"\n\nNorris West started.\n\n\"Someone substituted--\" he began.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Smith, looking at him keenly; \"someone who was here\nyesterday.  Have you any idea whom it could have been?\"\n\nWest hesitated.  \"I had a visitor in the afternoon,\" he said, seemingly\nspeaking the words unwillingly, \"but--\"\n\n\"A lady?\" jerked Smith.  \"I suggest that it was a lady.\"\n\nWest nodded.\n\n\"You're quite right,\" he admitted.  \"I don't know how you arrived at\nthe conclusion, but a lady whose acquaintance I made recently--a\nforeign lady.\"\n\n\"Karamaneh!\" snapped Smith.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean in the least, but she came here--knowing\nthis to be my present address--to ask me to protect her from a\nmysterious man who had followed her right from Charing Cross.  She said\nhe was down in the lobby, and naturally, I asked her to wait here\nwhilst I went and sent him about his business.\"\n\nHe laughed shortly.\n\n\"I am over-old,\" he said, \"to be guyed by a woman.  You spoke just now\nof someone called Fu-Manchu. Is that the crook I'm indebted to for the\nloss of my plans?  I've had attempts made by agents of two European\ngovernments, but a Chinaman is a novelty.\"\n\n\"This Chinaman,\" Smith assured him, \"is the greatest novelty of his\nage.  You recognize your symptoms now from Bayard Taylor's account?\"\n\n\"Mr. West's statement,\" I said, \"ran closely parallel with portions of\nMoreau's book on 'Hashish Hallucinations.' Only Fu-Manchu, I think,\nwould have thought of employing Indian hemp.  I doubt, though, if it\nwas pure Cannabis indica. At any rate, it acted as an opiate--\"\n\n\"And drugged Mr. West,\" interrupted Smith, \"sufficiently to enable\nFu-Manchu to enter unobserved.\"\n\n\"Whilst it produced symptoms which rendered him an easy subject for the\nDoctor's influence.  It is difficult in this case to separate\nhallucination from reality, but I think, Mr. West, that Fu-Manchu must\nhave exercised an hypnotic influence upon your drugged brain.  We have\nevidence that he dragged from you the secret of the combination.\"\n\n\"God knows we have!\" said West.  \"But who is this Fu-Manchu, and\nhow--how in the name of wonder did he get into my chambers?\"\n\nSmith pulled out his watch.  \"That,\" he said rapidly, \"I cannot delay\nto explain if I'm to intercept the man who has the plans.  Come along,\nPetrie; we must be at Tilbury within the hour.  There is just a bare\nchance.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIT was with my mind in a condition of unique perplexity that I hurried\nwith Nayland Smith into the cab which waited and dashed off through the\nstreets in which the busy life of London just stirred into being.  I\nsuppose I need not say that I could penetrate no farther into this,\nFu-Manchu's latest plot, than the drugging of Norris West with hashish?\nOf his having been so drugged with Indian hemp--that is, converted\ntemporarily into a maniac--would have been evident to any medical man\nwho had heard his statement and noted the distressing after-effects\nwhich conclusively pointed to Indian hemp poisoning.  Knowing something\nof the Chinese doctor's powers, I could understand that he might have\nextracted from West the secret of the combination by sheer force of\nwill whilst the American was under the influence of the drug.  But I\ncould not understand how Fu-Manchu had gained access to locked chambers\non the third story of a building.\n\n\"Smith,\" I said, \"those bird tracks on the window-sill--they furnish\nthe key to a mystery which is puzzling me.\"\n\n\"They do,\" said Smith, glancing impatiently at his watch.  \"Consult\nyour memories of Dr. Fu-Manchu's habits--especially your memories of\nhis pets.\"\n\nI reviewed in my mind the creatures gruesome and terrible which\nsurrounded the Chinaman--the scorpions, the bacteria, the noxious\nthings which were the weapons wherewith he visited death upon\nwhomsoever opposed the establishment of a potential Yellow Empire.  But\nno one of them could account for the imprints upon the dust of West's\nwindow-sill.\n\n\"You puzzle me, Smith,\" I confessed.  \"There is much in this\nextraordinary case that puzzles me.  I can think of nothing to account\nfor the marks.\"\n\n\"Have you thought of Fu-Manchu's marmoset?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"The monkey!\" I cried.\n\n\"They were the footprints of a small ape,\" my friend continued.  \"For a\nmoment I was deceived as you were, and believed them to be the tracks\nof a large bird; but I have seen the footprints of apes before now, and\na marmoset, though an American variety, I believe, is not unlike some\nof the apes of Burma.\"\n\n\"I am still in the dark,\" I said.\n\n\"It is pure hypothesis,\" continued Smith, \"but here is the theory--in\nlieu of a better one it covers the facts.  The marmoset--and it is\ncontrary from the character of Fu-Manchu to keep any creature for mere\namusement--is trained to perform certain duties.\n\n\"You observed the waterspout running up beside the window; you observed\nthe iron bar intended to prevent a window-cleaner from falling out?\nFor an ape the climb from the court below to the sill above was a\nsimple one.  He carried a cord, probably attached to his body.  He\nclimbed on to the sill, over the bar, and climbed down again.  By means\nof this cord a rope was pulled up over the bar, by means of the rope\none of those ladders of silk and bamboo.  One of the Doctor's servants\nascended--probably to ascertain if the hashish had acted successfully.\nThat was the yellow dream-face which West saw bending over him.  Then\nfollowed the Doctor, and to his giant will the drugged brain of West\nwas a pliant instrument which he bent to his own ends.  The court would\nbe deserted at that hour of the night, and, in any event, directly\nafter the ascent the ladder probably was pulled up, only to be lowered\nagain when West had revealed the secret of his own safe and Fu-Manchu\nhad secured the plans.  The reclosing of the safe and the removing of\nthe hashish tabloids, leaving no clew beyond the delirious ravings of a\ndrug slave--for so anyone unacquainted with the East must have\nconstrued West's story--is particularly characteristic.  His own\ntabloids were returned, of course.  The sparing of his life alone is a\nrefinement of art which points to a past master.\"\n\n\"Karamaneh was the decoy again?\" I said shortly.\n\n\"Certainly.  Hers was the task to ascertain West's habits and to\nsubstitute the tabloids.  She it was who waited in the luxurious\ncar--infinitely less likely to attract attention at that hour in that\nplace than a modest taxi--and received the stolen plans.  She did her\nwork well.\n\n\"Poor Karamaneh; she had no alternative!  I said I would have given a\nhundred pounds for a sight of the messenger's face--the man to whom she\nhanded them.  I would give a thousand now!\"\n\n\"ANDAMAN--SECOND,\" I said.  \"What did she mean?\"\n\n\"Then it has not dawned upon you?\" cried Smith excitedly, as the cab\nturned into the station.  \"The ANDAMAN, of the Oriental Navigation\nCompany's line, leaves Tilbury with the next tide for China ports.  Our\nman is a second-class passenger.  I am wiring to delay her departure,\nand the special should get us to the docks inside of forty minutes.\"\n\n\nVery vividly I can reconstruct in my mind that dash to the docks\nthrough the early autumn morning.  My friend being invested with\nextraordinary powers from the highest authorities, by Inspector\nWeymouth's instructions the line had been cleared all the way.\n\nSomething of the tremendous importance of Nayland Smith's mission came\nhome to me as we hurried on to the platform, escorted by the\nstation-master, and the five of us--for Weymouth had two other C.I.D.\nmen with him--took our seats in the special.\n\nOff we went on top speed, roaring through stations, where a glimpse\nmight be had of wondering officials upon the platforms, for a special\ntrain was a novelty on the line.  All ordinary traffic arrangements\nwere held up until we had passed through, and we reached Tilbury in\ntime which I doubt not constituted a record.\n\nThere at the docks was the great liner, delayed in her passage to the\nFar East by the will of my royally empowered companion.  It was novel,\nand infinitely exciting.\n\n\"Mr. Commissioner Nayland Smith?\" said the captain interrogatively,\nwhen we were shown into his room, and looked from one to another and\nback to the telegraph form which he held in his hand.\n\n\"The same, Captain,\" said my friend briskly.  \"I shall not detain you a\nmoment.  I am instructing the authorities at all ports east of Suez to\napprehend one of your second-class passengers, should he leave the\nship.  He is in possession of plans which practically belong to the\nBritish Government!\"\n\n\"Why not arrest him now?\" asked the seaman bluntly.\n\n\"Because I don't know him.  All second-class passengers' baggage will\nbe searched as they land.  I am hoping something from that, if all else\nfails.  But I want you privately to instruct your stewards to watch any\npassenger of Oriental nationality, and to cooperate with the two\nScotland Yard men who are joining you for the voyage.  I look to you to\nrecover these plans, Captain.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" the captain assured him.\n\nThen, from amid the heterogeneous group on the dockside, we were\nwatching the liner depart, and Nayland Smith's expression was a very\nsingular one.  Inspector Weymouth stood with us, a badly puzzled man.\nThen occurred the extraordinary incident which to this day remains\ninexplicable, for, clearly heard by all three of us, a guttural voice\nsaid:\n\n\"Another victory for China, Mr. Nayland Smith!\"\n\nI turned as though I had been stung.  Smith turned also.  My eyes\npassed from face to face of the group about us.  None was familiar.  No\none apparently had moved away.\n\nBut the voice was the voice of DOCTOR FU-MANCHU.\n\nAs I write of it, now, I can appreciate the difference between that\nhappening, as it appealed to us, and as it must appeal to you who\nmerely read of it.  It is beyond my powers to convey the sense of the\nuncanny which the episode created.  Yet, even as I think of it, I feel\nagain, though in lesser degree, the chill which seemed to creep through\nmy veins that day.\n\nFrom my brief history of the wonderful and evil man who once walked, by\nthe way unsuspected, in the midst of the people of England--near whom\nyou, personally, may at some time unwittingly, have been--I am aware\nthat much must be omitted.  I have no space for lengthy examinations of\nthe many points but ill illuminated with which it is dotted.  This\nincident at the docks is but one such point.\n\nAnother is the singular vision which appeared to me whilst I lay in the\ncellar of the house near Windsor.  It has since struck me that it\npossessed peculiarities akin to those of a hashish hallucination.  Can\nit be that we were drugged on that occasion with Indian hemp?  Cannabis\nindica is a treacherous narcotic, as every medical man knows full well;\nbut Fu-Manchu's knowledge of the drug was far in advance of our slow\nscience.  West's experience proved so much.\n\nI may have neglected opportunities--later, you shall judge if I did\nso--opportunities to glean for the West some of the strange knowledge\nof the secret East.  Perhaps, at a future time, I may rectify my\nerrors.  Perhaps that wisdom--the wisdom stored up by Fu-Manchu--is\nlost forever.  There is, however, at least a bare possibility of its\nsurvival, in part; and I do not wholly despair of one day publishing a\nscientific sequel to this record of our dealings with the Chinese\ndoctor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTIME wore on and seemingly brought us no nearer, or very little nearer,\nto our goal.  So carefully had my friend Nayland Smith excluded the\nmatter from the press that, whilst public interest was much engaged\nwith some of the events in the skein of mystery which he had come from\nBurma to unravel, outside the Secret Service and the special department\nof Scotland Yard few people recognized that the several murders,\nrobberies and disappearances formed each a link in a chain; fewer still\nwere aware that a baneful presence was in our midst, that a past master\nof the evil arts lay concealed somewhere in the metropolis; searched\nfor by the keenest wits which the authorities could direct to the task,\nbut eluding all--triumphant, contemptuous.\n\nOne link in that chain Smith himself for long failed to recognize.  Yet\nit was a big and important link.\n\n\"Petrie,\" he said to me one morning, \"listen to this:\n\n\"'. . . In sight of Shanghai--a clear, dark night.  On board the deck of\na junk passing close to seaward of the Andaman a blue flare started up.\nA minute later there was a cry of \"Man overboard!\"\n\n\"'Mr. Lewin, the chief officer, who was in charge, stopped the engines.\nA boat was put out.  But no one was recovered.  There are sharks in\nthese waters.  A fairly heavy sea was running.\n\n\"'Inquiry showed the missing man to be a James Edwards, second class,\nbooked to Shanghai.  I think the name was assumed.  The man was some\nsort of Oriental, and we had had him under close observation. . . .'\"\n\n\"That's the end of their report,\" exclaimed Smith.\n\nHe referred to the two C.I.D. men who had joined the Andaman at the\nmoment of her departure from Tilbury.\n\nHe carefully lighted his pipe.\n\n\"IS it a victory for China, Petrie?\" he said softly.\n\n\"Until the great war reveals her secret resources--and I pray that the\nday be not in my time--we shall never know,\" I replied.\n\nSmith began striding up and down the room.\n\n\"Whose name,\" he jerked abruptly, \"stands now at the head of our danger\nlist?\"\n\nHe referred to a list which we had compiled of the notable men\nintervening between the evil genius who secretly had invaded London and\nthe triumph of his cause--the triumph of the yellow races.\n\nI glanced at our notes.  \"Lord Southery,\" I replied.\n\nSmith tossed the morning paper across to me.\n\n\"Look,\" he said shortly.  \"He's dead.\"\n\nI read the account of the peer's death, and glanced at the long\nobituary notice; but no more than glanced at it.  He had but recently\nreturned from the East, and now, after a short illness, had died from\nsome affection of the heart.  There had been no intimation that his\nillness was of a serious nature, and even Smith, who watched over his\nflock--the flock threatened by the wolf, Fu-Manchu--with jealous zeal,\nhad not suspected that the end was so near.\n\n\"Do you think he died a natural death, Smith?\" I asked.\n\nMy friend reached across the table and rested the tip of a long finger\nupon one of the sub-headings to the account:\n\n\n\"SIR FRANK NARCOMBE SUMMONED TOO LATE.\"\n\n\n\"You see,\" said Smith, \"Southery died during the night, but Sir Frank\nNarcombe, arriving a few minutes later, unhesitatingly pronounced death\nto be due to syncope, and seems to have noticed nothing suspicious.\"\n\nI looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"Sir Frank is a great physician,\" I said slowly; \"but we must remember\nhe would be looking for nothing suspicious.\"\n\n\"We must remember,\" rapped Smith, \"that, if Dr. Fu-Manchu is\nresponsible for Southery's death, except to the eye of an expert there\nwould be nothing suspicious to see.  Fu-Manchu leaves no clews.\"\n\n\"Are you going around?\" I asked.\n\nSmith shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I think not,\" he replied.  \"Either a greater One than Fu-Manchu has\ntaken Lord Southery, or the yellow doctor has done his work so well\nthat no trace remains of his presence in the matter.\"\n\nLeaving his breakfast untasted, he wandered aimlessly about the room,\nlittering the hearth with matches as he constantly relighted his pipe,\nwhich went out every few minutes.\n\n\"It's no good, Petrie,\" he burst out suddenly; \"it cannot be a\ncoincidence.  We must go around and see him.\"\n\nAn hour later we stood in the silent room, with its drawn blinds and\nits deathful atmosphere, looking down at the pale, intellectual face of\nHenry Stradwick, Lord Southery, the greatest engineer of his day.  The\nmind that lay behind that splendid brow had planned the construction of\nthe railway for which Russia had paid so great a price, had conceived\nthe scheme for the canal which, in the near future, was to bring two\ngreat continents, a full week's journey nearer one to the other.  But\nnow it would plan no more.\n\n\"He had latterly developed symptoms of angina pectoris,\" explained the\nfamily physician; \"but I had not anticipated a fatal termination so\nsoon.  I was called about two o'clock this morning, and found Lord\nSouthery in a dangerously exhausted condition.  I did all that was\npossible, and Sir Frank Narcombe was sent for.  But shortly before his\narrival the patient expired.\"\n\n\"I understand, Doctor, that you had been treating Lord Southery for\nangina pectoris?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the reply, \"for some months.\"\n\n\"You regard the circumstances of his end as entirely consistent with a\ndeath from that cause?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  Do you observe anything unusual yourself?  Sir Frank\nNarcombe quite agrees with me.  There is surely no room for doubt?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Smith, tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear.\n\"We do not question the accuracy of your diagnosis in any way, sir.\"\n\nThe physician seemed puzzled.\n\n\"But am I not right in supposing that you are connected with the\npolice?\" asked the physician.\n\n\"Neither Dr. Petrie nor myself are in any way connected with the\npolice,\" answered Smith.  \"But, nevertheless, I look to you to regard\nour recent questions as confidential.\"\n\nAs we were leaving the house, hushed awesomely in deference to the\nunseen visitor who had touched Lord Southery with gray, cold fingers,\nSmith paused, detaining a black-coated man who passed us on the stairs.\n\n\"You were Lord Southery's valet?\"\n\nThe man bowed.\n\n\"Were you in the room at the moment of his fatal seizure?\"\n\n\"I was, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you see or hear anything unusual--anything unaccountable?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"No strange sounds outside the house, for instance?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, and Smith, taking my arm, passed out into the\nstreet.\n\n\"Perhaps this business is making me imaginative,\" he said; \"but there\nseems to be something tainting the air in yonder--something peculiar to\nhouses whose doors bear the invisible death-mark of Fu-Manchu.\"\n\n\"You are right, Smith!\" I cried.  \"I hesitated to mention the matter,\nbut I, too, have developed some other sense which warns me of the\nDoctor's presence.  Although there is not a scrap of confirmatory\nevidence, I am as sure that he has brought about Lord Southery's death\nas if I had seen him strike the blow.\"\n\nIt was in that torturing frame of mind--chained, helpless, in our\nignorance, or by reason of the Chinaman's supernormal genius--that we\nlived throughout the ensuing days.  My friend began to look like a man\nconsumed by a burning fever.  Yet, we could not act.\n\nIn the growing dark of an evening shortly following I stood idly\nturning over some of the works exposed for sale outside a second-hand\nbookseller's in New Oxford Street.  One dealing with the secret\nsocieties of China struck me as being likely to prove instructive, and\nI was about to call the shopman when I was startled to feel a hand\nclutch my arm.\n\nI turned around rapidly--and was looking into the darkly beautiful eyes\nof Karamaneh!  She--whom I had seen in so many guises--was dressed in a\nperfectly fitting walking habit, and had much of her wonderful hair\nconcealed beneath a fashionable hat.\n\nShe glanced about her apprehensively.\n\n\"Quick!  Come round the corner.  I must speak to you,\" she said, her\nmusical voice thrilling with excitement.\n\nI never was quite master of myself in her presence.  He must have been\na man of ice who could have been, I think, for her beauty had all the\nbouquet of rarity; she was a mystery--and mystery adds charm to a\nwoman.  Probably she should have been under arrest, but I know I would\nhave risked much to save her from it.\n\nAs we turned into a quiet thoroughfare she stopped and said:\n\n\"I am in distress.  You have often asked me to enable you to capture\nDr. Fu-Manchu. I am prepared to do so.\"\n\nI could scarcely believe that I heard right.\n\n\"Your brother--\" I began.\n\nShe seized my arm entreatingly, looking into my eyes.\n\n\"You are a doctor,\" she said.  \"I want you to come and see him now.\"\n\n\"What!  Is he in London?\"\n\n\"He is at the house of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\"\n\n\"And you would have me--\"\n\n\"Accompany me there, yes.\"\n\nNayland Smith, I doubted not, would have counseled me against trusting\nmy life in the hands of this girl with the pleading eyes.  Yet I did\nso, and with little hesitation; shortly we were traveling eastward in a\nclosed cab.  Karamaneh was very silent, but always when I turned to her\nI found her big eyes fixed upon me with an expression in which there\nwas pleading, in which there was sorrow, in which there was something\nelse--something indefinable, yet strangely disturbing.  The cabman she\nhad directed to drive to the lower end of the Commercial Road, the\nneighborhood of the new docks, and the scene of one of our early\nadventures with Dr. Fu-Manchu. The mantle of dusk had closed about the\nsqualid activity of the East End streets as we neared our destination.\nAliens of every shade of color were about us now, emerging from\nburrow-like alleys into the glare of the lamps upon the main road.  In\nthe short space of the drive we had passed from the bright world of the\nWest into the dubious underworld of the East.\n\nI do not know that Karamaneh moved; but in sympathy, as we neared the\nabode of the sinister Chinaman, she crept nearer to me, and when the\ncab was discharged, and together we walked down a narrow turning\nleading riverward, she clung to me fearfully, hesitated, and even\nseemed upon the point of turning back.  But, overcoming her fear or\nrepugnance, she led on, through a maze of alleyways and courts, wherein\nI hopelessly lost my bearings, so that it came home to me how wholly I\nwas in the hands of this girl whose history was so full of shadows,\nwhose real character was so inscrutable, whose beauty, whose charm\ntruly might mask the cunning of a serpent.\n\nI spoke to her.\n\n\"S-SH!\" She laid her hand upon my arm, enjoining me to silence.\n\nThe high, drab brick wall of what looked like some part of a dock\nbuilding loomed above us in the darkness, and the indescribable\nstenches of the lower Thames were borne to my nostrils through a\ngloomy, tunnel-like opening, beyond which whispered the river.  The\nmuffled clangor of waterside activity was about us.  I heard a key\ngrate in a lock, and Karamaneh drew me into the shadow of an open door,\nentered, and closed it behind her.\n\nFor the first time I perceived, in contrast to the odors of the court\nwithout, the fragrance of the peculiar perfume which now I had come to\nassociate with her.  Absolute darkness was about us, and by this\nperfume alone I knew that she was near to me, until her hand touched\nmine, and I was led along an uncarpeted passage and up an uncarpeted\nstair.  A second door was unlocked, and I found myself in an\nexquisitely furnished room, illuminated by the soft light of a shaded\nlamp which stood upon a low, inlaid table amidst a perfect ocean of\nsilken cushions, strewn upon a Persian carpet, whose yellow richness\nwas lost in the shadows beyond the circle of light.\n\nKaramaneh raised a curtain draped before a doorway, and stood listening\nintently for a moment.\n\nThe silence was unbroken.\n\nThen something stirred amid the wilderness of cushions, and two tiny\nbright eyes looked up at me.  Peering closely, I succeeded in\ndistinguishing, crouched in that soft luxuriance, a little ape.  It was\nDr. Fu-Manchu's marmoset.  \"This way,\" whispered Karamaneh.\n\nNever, I thought, was a staid medical man committed to a more unwise\nenterprise, but so far I had gone, and no consideration of prudence\ncould now be of avail.\n\nThe corridor beyond was thickly carpeted.  Following the direction of a\nfaint light which gleamed ahead, it proved to extend as a balcony\nacross one end of a spacious apartment.  Together we stood high up\nthere in the shadows, and looked down upon such a scene as I never\ncould have imagined to exist within many a mile of that district.\n\nThe place below was even more richly appointed than the room into which\nfirst we had come.  Here, as there, piles of cushions formed splashes\nof gaudy color about the floor.  Three lamps hung by chains from the\nceiling, their light softened by rich silk shades.  One wall was almost\nentirely occupied by glass cases containing chemical apparatus, tubes,\nretorts and other less orthodox indications of Dr. Fu-Manchu's\npursuits, whilst close against another lay the most extraordinary\nobject of a sufficiently extraordinary room--a low couch, upon which\nwas extended the motionless form of a boy.  In the light of a lamp\nwhich hung directly above him, his olive face showed an almost\nstartling resemblance to that of Karamaneh--save that the girl's\ncoloring was more delicate.  He had black, curly hair, which stood out\nprominently against the white covering upon which he lay, his hands\ncrossed upon his breast.\n\nTransfixed with astonishment, I stood looking down upon him.  The\nwonders of the \"Arabian Nights\" were wonders no longer, for here, in\nEast-End London, was a true magician's palace, lacking not its\nbeautiful slave, lacking not its enchanted prince!\n\n\"It is Aziz, my brother,\" said Karamaneh.\n\nWe passed down a stairway on to the floor of the apartment.  Karamaneh\nknelt and bent over the boy, stroking his hair and whispering to him\nlovingly.  I, too, bent over him; and I shall never forget the anxiety\nin the girl's eyes as she watched me eagerly whilst I made a brief\nexamination.\n\nBrief, indeed, for even ere I had touched him I knew that the comely\nshell held no spark of life.  But Karamaneh fondled the cold hands, and\nspoke softly in that Arabic tongue which long before I had divined must\nbe her native language.\n\nThen, as I remained silent, she turned and looked at me, read the truth\nin my eyes, and rose from her knees, stood rigidly upright, and\nclutched me tremblingly.\n\n\"He is not dead--he is NOT dead!\" she whispered, and shook me as a\nchild might, seeking to arouse me to a proper understanding.  \"Oh, tell\nme he is not--\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" I replied gently, \"for indeed he is.\"\n\n\"No!\" she said, wild-eyed, and raising her hands to her face as though\nhalf distraught.  \"You do not understand--yet you are a doctor.  You do\nnot understand--\"\n\nShe stopped, moaning to herself and looking from the handsome face of\nthe boy to me.  It was pitiful; it was uncanny.  But sorrow for the\ngirl predominated in my mind.\n\nThen from somewhere I heard a sound which I had heard before in houses\noccupied by Dr. Fu-Manchu--that of a muffled gong.\n\n\"Quick!\"  Karamaneh had me by the arm.  \"Up!  He has returned!\"\n\nShe fled up the stairs to the balcony, I close at her heels.  The\nshadows veiled us, the thick carpet deadened the sound of our tread, or\ncertainly we must have been detected by the man who entered the room we\nhad just quitted.\n\nIt was Dr. Fu-Manchu!\n\nYellow-robed, immobile, the inhuman green eyes glittering catlike even,\nit seemed, before the light struck them, he threaded his way through\nthe archipelago of cushions and bent over the couch of Aziz.\n\nKaramaneh dragged me down on to my knees.\n\n\"Watch!\" she whispered.  \"Watch!\"\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu felt for the pulse of the boy whom a moment since I had\npronounced dead, and, stepping to the tall glass case, took out a\nlong-necked flask of chased gold, and from it, into a graduated glass,\nhe poured some drops of an amber liquid wholly unfamiliar to me.  I\nwatched him with all my eyes, and noted how high the liquid rose in the\nmeasure.  He charged a needle-syringe, and, bending again over Aziz,\nmade an injection.\n\nThen all the wonders I had heard of this man became possible, and with\nan awe which any other physician who had examined Aziz must have felt,\nI admitted him a miracle-worker. For as I watched, all but breathless,\nthe dead came to life!  The glow of health crept upon the olive\ncheek--the boy moved--he raised his hands above his head--he sat up,\nsupported by the Chinese doctor!\n\nFu-Manchu touched some hidden bell.  A hideous yellow man with a\nscarred face entered, carrying a tray upon which were a bowl containing\nsome steaming fluid, apparently soup, what looked like oaten cakes, and\na flask of red wine.\n\nAs the boy, exhibiting no more unusual symptoms than if he had just\nawakened from a normal sleep, commenced his repast, Karamaneh drew me\ngently along the passage into the room which we had first entered.  My\nheart leaped wildly as the marmoset bounded past us to drop hand over\nhand to the lower apartment in search of its master.\n\n\"You see,\" said Karamaneh, her voice quivering, \"he is not dead!  But\nwithout Fu-Manchu he is dead to me.  How can I leave him when he holds\nthe life of Aziz in his hand?\"\n\n\"You must get me that flask, or some of its contents,\" I directed.\n\"But tell me, how does he produce the appearance of death?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you,\" she replied.  \"I do not know.  It is something in\nthe wine.  In another hour Aziz will be again as you saw him.  But\nsee.\"  And, opening a little ebony box, she produced a phial half\nfilled with the amber liquid.\n\n\"Good!\" I said, and slipped it into my pocket.  \"When will be the best\ntime to seize Fu-Manchu and to restore your brother?\"\n\n\"I will let you know,\" she whispered, and, opening the door, pushed me\nhurriedly from the room.  \"He is going away to-night to the north; but\nyou must not come to-night. Quick!  Quick!  Along the passage.  He may\ncall me at any moment.\"\n\nSo, with the phial in my pocket containing a potent preparation unknown\nto Western science, and with a last long look into the eyes of\nKaramaneh, I passed out into the narrow alley, out from the fragrant\nperfumes of that mystery house into the place of Thames-side stenches.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\n\"WE must arrange for the house to be raided without delay,\" said Smith.\n\"This time we are sure of our ally--\"\n\n\"But we must keep our promise to her,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"You can look after that, Petrie,\" my friend said.  \"I will devote the\nwhole of my attention to Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" he added grimly.\n\nUp and down the room he paced, gripping the blackened briar between his\nteeth, so that the muscles stood out squarely upon his lean jaws.  The\nbronze which spoke of the Burmese sun enhanced the brightness of his\ngray eyes.\n\n\"What have I all along maintained?\" he jerked, looking back at me\nacross his shoulder--\"that, although Karamaneh was one of the strongest\nweapons in the Doctor's armory, she was one which some day would be\nturned against him.  That day has dawned.\"\n\n\"We must await word from her.\"\n\n\"Quite so.\"\n\nHe knocked out his pipe on the grate.  Then:\n\n\"Have you any idea of the nature of the fluid in the phial?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest.  And I have none to spare for analytical purposes.\"\n\nNayland Smith began stuffing mixture into the hot pipe-bowl, and\ndropping an almost equal quantity on the floor.\n\n\"I cannot rest, Petrie,\" he said.  \"I am itching to get to work.  Yet,\na false move, and--\" He lighted his pipe, and stood staring from the\nwindow.\n\n\"I shall, of course, take a needle-syringe with me,\" I explained.\n\nSmith made no reply.\n\n\"If I but knew the composition of the drug which produced the semblance\nof death,\" I continued, \"my fame would long survive my ashes.\"\n\nMy friend did not turn.  But:\n\n\"She said it was something he put in the wine?\" he jerked.\n\n\"In the wine, yes.\"\n\nSilence fell.  My thoughts reverted to Karamaneh, whom Dr. Fu-Manchu\nheld in bonds stronger than any slave-chains. For, with Aziz, her\nbrother, suspended between life and death, what could she do save obey\nthe mandates of the cunning Chinaman?  What perverted genius was his!\nIf that treasury of obscure wisdom which he, perhaps alone of living\nmen, had rifled, could but be thrown open to the sick and suffering,\nthe name of Dr. Fu-Manchu would rank with the golden ones in the\nhistory of healing.\n\nNayland Smith suddenly turned, and the expression upon his face amazed\nme.\n\n\"Look up the next train to L--!\" he rapped.\n\n\"To L--?  What--?\"\n\n\"There's the Bradshaw.  We haven't a minute to waste.\"\n\nIn his voice was the imperative note I knew so well; in his eyes was\nthe light which told of an urgent need for action--a portentous truth\nsuddenly grasped.\n\n\"One in half-an-hour--the last.\"\n\n\"We must catch it.\"\n\nNo further word of explanation he vouchsafed, but darted off to dress;\nfor he had spent the afternoon pacing the room in his dressing-gown and\nsmoking without intermission.\n\nOut and to the corner we hurried, and leaped into the first taxi upon\nthe rank.  Smith enjoined the man to hasten, and we were off--all in\nthat whirl of feverish activity which characterized my friend's\nmovements in times of important action.\n\nHe sat glancing impatiently from the window and twitching at the lobe\nof his ear.\n\n\"I know you will forgive me, old man,\" he said, \"but there is a little\nproblem which I am trying to work out in my mind.  Did you bring the\nthings I mentioned?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nConversation lapsed, until, just as the cab turned into the station,\nSmith said:  \"Should you consider Lord Southery to have been the first\nconstructive engineer of his time, Petrie?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I replied.\n\n\"Greater than Von Homber, of Berlin?\"\n\n\"Possibly not.  But Von Homber has been dead for three years.\"\n\n\"Three years, is it?\"\n\n\"Roughly.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\nWe reached the station in time to secure a non-corridor compartment to\nourselves, and to allow Smith leisure carefully to inspect the\noccupants of all the others, from the engine to the guard's van.  He\nwas muffled up to the eyes, and he warned me to keep out of sight in\nthe corner of the compartment.  In fact, his behavior had me bursting\nwith curiosity.  The train having started:\n\n\"Don't imagine, Petrie,\" said Smith \"that I am trying to lead you\nblindfolded in order later to dazzle you with my perspicacity.  I am\nsimply afraid that this may be a wild-goose chase.  The idea upon which\nI am acting does not seem to have struck you.  I wish it had.  The fact\nwould argue in favor of its being sound.\"\n\n\"At present I am hopelessly mystified.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will not bias you towards my view.  But just study the\nsituation, and see if you can arrive at the reason for this sudden\njourney.  I shall be distinctly encouraged if you succeed.\"\n\nBut I did not succeed, and since Smith obviously was unwilling to\nenlighten me, I pressed him no more.  The train stopped at Rugby, where\nhe was engaged with the stationmaster in making some mysterious\narrangements.  At L--, however, their object became plain, for a\nhigh-power car was awaiting us, and into this we hurried and ere the\ngreater number of passengers had reached the platform were being driven\noff at headlong speed along the moon-bathed roads.\n\nTwenty minutes' rapid traveling, and a white mansion leaped into the\nline of sight, standing out vividly against its woody backing.\n\n\"Stradwick Hall,\" said Smith.  \"The home of Lord Southery.  We are\nfirst--but Dr. Fu-Manchu was on the train.\"\n\nThen the truth dawned upon the gloom of my perplexity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\n\"YOUR extraordinary proposal fills me with horror, Mr. Smith!\"\n\nThe sleek little man in the dress suit, who looked like a head waiter\n(but was the trusted legal adviser of the house of Southery) puffed at\nhis cigar indignantly.  Nayland Smith, whose restless pacing had led\nhim to the far end of the library, turned, a remote but virile figure,\nand looked back to where I stood by the open hearth with the solicitor.\n\n\"I am in your hands, Mr. Henderson,\" he said, and advanced upon the\nlatter, his gray eyes ablaze.  \"Save for the heir, who is abroad on\nforeign service, you say there is no kin of Lord Southery to consider.\nThe word rests with you.  If I am wrong, and you agree to my proposal,\nthere is none whose susceptibilities will suffer--\"\n\n\"My own, sir!\"\n\n\"If I am right, and you prevent me from acting, you become a murderer,\nMr. Henderson.\"\n\nThe lawyer started, staring nervously up at Smith, who now towered over\nhim menacingly.\n\n\"Lord Southery was a lonely man,\" continued my friend.  \"If I could\nhave placed my proposition before one of his blood, I do not doubt what\nmy answer had been.  Why do you hesitate?  Why do you experience this\nfeeling of horror?\"\n\nMr. Henderson stared down into the fire.  His constitutionally ruddy\nface was pale.\n\n\"It is entirely irregular, Mr. Smith.  We have not the necessary\npowers--\"\n\nSmith snapped his teeth together impatiently, snatching his watch from\nhis pocket and glancing at it.\n\n\"I am vested with the necessary powers.  I will give you a written\norder, sir.\"\n\n\"The proceeding savors of paganism.  Such a course might be admissible\nin China, in Burma--\"\n\n\"Do you weigh a life against such quibbles?  Do you suppose that,\ngranting MY irresponsibility, Dr. Petrie would countenance such a thing\nif he doubted the necessity?\"\n\nMr. Henderson looked at me with pathetic hesitance.\n\n\"There are guests in the house--mourners who attended the ceremony\nto-day. They--\"\n\n\"Will never know, if we are in error,\" interrupted Smith.  \"Good God!\nwhy do you delay?\"\n\n\"You wish it to be kept secret?\"\n\n\"You and I, Mr. Henderson, and Dr. Petrie will go now.  We require no\nother witnesses.  We are answerable only to our consciences.\"\n\nThe lawyer passed his hand across his damp brow.\n\n\"I have never in my life been called upon to come to so momentous a\ndecision in so short a time,\" he confessed.  But, aided by Smith's\nindomitable will, he made his decision.  As its result, we three,\nlooking and feeling like conspirators, hurried across the park beneath\na moon whose placidity was a rebuke to the turbulent passions which\nreared their strangle-growth in the garden of England.  Not a breath of\nwind stirred amid the leaves.  The calm of perfect night soothed\neverything to slumber.  Yet, if Smith were right (and I did not doubt\nhim), the green eyes of Dr. Fu-Manchu had looked upon the scene; and I\nfound myself marveling that its beauty had not wilted up.  Even now the\ndread Chinaman must be near to us.\n\nAs Mr. Henderson unlocked the ancient iron gates he turned to Nayland\nSmith.  His face twitched oddly.\n\n\"Witness that I do this unwillingly,\" he said--\"most unwillingly.\"\n\n\"Mine be the responsibility,\" was the reply.\n\nSmith's voice quivered, responsive to the nervous vitality pent up\nwithin that lean frame.  He stood motionless, listening--and I knew for\nwhom he listened.  He peered about him to right and left--and I knew\nwhom he expected but dreaded to see.\n\nAbove us now the trees looked down with a solemnity different from the\naspect of the monarchs of the park, and the nearer we came to our\njourney's end the more somber and lowering bent the verdant arch--or so\nit seemed.\n\nBy that path, patched now with pools of moonlight, Lord Southery had\npassed upon his bier, with the sun to light his going; by that path\nseveral generations of Stradwicks had gone to their last resting-place.\n\nTo the doors of the vault the moon rays found free access.  No branch,\nno leaf, intervened.  Mr. Henderson's face looked ghastly.  The keys\nwhich he carried rattled in his hand.\n\n\"Light the lantern,\" he said unsteadily.\n\nNayland Smith, who again had been peering suspiciously about into the\nshadows, struck a match and lighted the lantern which he carried.  He\nturned to the solicitor.\n\n\"Be calm, Mr. Henderson,\" he said sternly.  \"It is your plain duty to\nyour client.\"\n\n\"God be my witness that I doubt it,\" replied Henderson, and opened the\ndoor.\n\nWe descended the steps.  The air beneath was damp and chill.  It\ntouched us as with clammy fingers; and the sensation was not wholly\nphysical.\n\nBefore the narrow mansion which now sufficed Lord Southery, the great\nengineer whom kings had honored, Henderson reeled and clutched at me\nfor support.  Smith and I had looked to him for no aid in our uncanny\ntask, and rightly.\n\nWith averted eyes he stood over by the steps of the tomb, whilst my\nfriend and myself set to work.  In the pursuit of my profession I had\nundertaken labors as unpleasant, but never amid an environment such as\nthis.  It seemed that generations of Stradwicks listened to each turn\nof every screw.\n\nAt last it was done, and the pallid face of Lord Southery questioned\nthe intruding light.  Nayland Smith's hand was as steady as a rigid bar\nwhen he raised the lantern.  Later, I knew, there would be a sudden\nreleasing of the tension of will--a reaction physical and mental--but\nnot until his work was finished.\n\nThat my own hand was steady I ascribed to one thing\nsolely--professional zeal.  For, under conditions which, in the event\nof failure and exposure, must have led to an unpleasant inquiry by the\nBritish Medical Association, I was about to attempt an experiment never\nbefore essayed by a physician of the white races.\n\nThough I failed, though I succeeded, that it ever came before the\nB.M.A., or any other council, was improbable; in the former event, all\nbut impossible.  But the knowledge that I was about to practice\ncharlatanry, or what any one of my fellow-practitioners must have\ndesignated as such, was with me.  Yet so profound had my belief become\nin the extraordinary being whose existence was a danger to the world\nthat I reveled in my immunity from official censure.  I was glad that\nit had fallen to my lot to take at least one step--though blindly--into\nthe FUTURE of medical science.\n\nSo far as my skill bore me, Lord Southery was dead.  Unhesitatingly, I\nwould have given a death certificate, save for two considerations.  The\nfirst, although his latest scheme ran contrary from the interests of\nDr. Fu-Manchu, his genius, diverted into other channels, would serve\nthe yellow group better than his death.  The second, I had seen the boy\nAziz raised from a state as like death as this.\n\nFrom the phial of amber-hued liquid which I had with me, I charged the\nneedle syringe.  I made the injection, and waited.\n\n\"If he is really dead!\" whispered Smith.  \"It seems incredible that he\ncan have survived for three days without food.  Yet I have known a\nfakir to go for a week.\"\n\nMr. Henderson groaned.\n\nWatch in hand, I stood observing the gray face.\n\nA second passed; another; a third.  In the fourth the miracle began.\nOver the seemingly cold clay crept the hue of pulsing life.  It came in\nwaves--in waves which corresponded with the throbbing of the awakened\nheart; which swept fuller and stronger; which filled and quickened the\nchilled body.\n\nAs we rapidly freed the living man from the trappings of the dead one,\nSouthery, uttering a stifled scream, sat up, looked about him with\nhalf-glazed eyes, and fell back.  \"My God!\" cried Smith.\n\n\"It is all right,\" I said, and had time to note how my voice had\nassumed a professional tone.  \"A little brandy from my flask is all\nthat is necessary now.\"\n\n\"You have two patients, Doctor,\" rapped my friend.\n\nMr. Henderson had fallen in a swoon to the floor of the vault.\n\n\"Quiet,\" whispered Smith; \"HE is here.\"\n\nHe extinguished the light.\n\nI supported Lord Southery.  \"What has happened?\" he kept moaning.\n\"Where am I?  Oh, God!  what has happened?\"\n\nI strove to reassure him in a whisper, and placed my traveling coat\nabout him.  The door at the top of the mausoleum steps we had reclosed\nbut not relocked.  Now, as I upheld the man whom literally we had\nrescued from the grave, I heard the door reopen.  To aid Henderson I\ncould make no move.  Smith was breathing hard beside me.  I dared not\nthink what was about to happen, nor what its effects might be upon Lord\nSouthery in his exhausted condition.\n\nThrough the Memphian dark of the tomb cut a spear of light, touching\nthe last stone of the stairway.\n\nA guttural voice spoke some words rapidly, and I knew that Dr.\nFu-Manchu stood at the head of the stairs.  Although I could not see my\nfriend, I became aware that Nayland Smith had his revolver in his hand,\nand I reached into my pocket for mine.\n\nAt last the cunning Chinaman was about to fall into a trap.  It would\nrequire all his genius, I thought, to save him to-night.  Unless his\nsuspicions were aroused by the unlocked door, his capture was imminent.\n\nSomeone was descending the steps.\n\nIn my right hand I held my revolver, and with my left arm about Lord\nSouthery, I waited through ten such seconds of suspense as I have\nrarely known.\n\nThe spear of light plunged into the well of darkness again.\n\nLord Southery, Smith and myself were hidden by the angle of the wall;\nbut full upon the purplish face of Mr. Henderson the beam shone.  In\nsome way it penetrated to the murk in his mind; and he awakened from\nhis swoon with a hoarse cry, struggled to his feet, and stood looking\nup the stair in a sort of frozen horror.\n\nSmith was past him at a bound.  Something flashed towards him as the\nlight was extinguished.  I saw him duck, and heard the knife ring upon\nthe floor.\n\nI managed to move sufficiently to see at the top, as I fired up the\nstairs, the yellow face of Dr. Fu-Manchu, to see the gleaming,\nchatoyant eyes, greenly terrible, as they sought to pierce the gloom.\nA flying figure was racing up, three steps at a time (that of a brown\nman scantily clad). He stumbled and fell, by which I knew that he was\nhit; but went on again, Smith hard on his heels.\n\n\"Mr. Henderson!\" I cried, \"relight the lantern and take charge of Lord\nSouthery.  Here is my flask on the floor.  I rely upon you.\"\n\nSmith's revolver spoke again as I went bounding up the stair.  Black\nagainst the square of moonlight I saw him stagger, I saw him fall.  As\nhe fell, for the third time, I heard the crack of his revolver.\n\nInstantly I was at his side.  Somewhere along the black aisle beneath\nthe trees receding footsteps pattered.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Smith?\" I cried anxiously.\n\nHe got upon his feet.\n\n\"He has a dacoit with him,\" he replied, and showed me the long curved\nknife which he held in his hand, a full inch of the blade bloodstained.\n\"A near thing for me, Petrie.\"\n\nI heard the whir of a restarted motor.\n\n\"We have lost him,\" said Smith.\n\n\"But we have saved Lord Southery,\" I said.  \"Fu-Manchu will credit us\nwith a skill as great as his own.\"\n\n\"We must get to the car,\" Smith muttered, \"and try to overtake them.\nUgh!  my left arm is useless.\"\n\n\"It would be mere waste of time to attempt to overtake them,\" I argued,\n\"for we have no idea in which direction they will proceed.\"\n\n\"I have a very good idea,\" snapped Smith.  \"Stradwick Hall is less than\nten miles from the coast.  There is only one practicable means of\nconveying an unconscious man secretly from here to London.\"\n\n\"You think he meant to take him from here to London?\"\n\n\"Prior to shipping him to China; I think so.  His clearing-house is\nprobably on the Thames.\"\n\n\"A boat?\"\n\n\"A yacht, presumably, is lying off the coast in readiness.  Fu-Manchu\nmay even have designed to ship him direct to China.\"\n\nLord Southery, a bizarre figure, my traveling coat wrapped about him,\nand supported by his solicitor, who was almost as pale as himself,\nemerged from the vault into the moonlight.\n\n\"This is a triumph for you, Smith,\" I said.\n\nThe throb of Fu-Manchu's car died into faintness and was lost in the\nnight's silence.\n\n\"Only half a triumph,\" he replied.  \"But we still have another\nchance--the raid on his house.  When will the word come from Karamaneh?\"\n\nSouthery spoke in a weak voice.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"it seems I am raised from the dead.\"\n\nIt was the weirdest moment of the night wherein we heard that newly\nburied man speak from the mold of his tomb.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Smith slowly, \"and spared from the fate of Heaven alone\nknows how many men of genius.  The yellow society lacks a Southery, but\nthat Dr. Fu-Manchu was in Germany three years ago I have reason to\nbelieve; so that, even without visiting the grave of your great\nTeutonic rival, who suddenly died at about that time, I venture to\npredict that they have a Von Homber.  And the futurist group in China\nknows how to MAKE men work!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nFROM the rescue of Lord Southery my story bears me mercilessly on to\nother things.  I may not tarry, as more leisurely penmen, to round my\nincidents; they were not of my choosing.  I may not pause to make you\nbetter acquainted with the figure of my drama; its scheme is none of\nmine.  Often enough, in those days, I found a fitness in the lines of\nOmar:\n\n\n    We are no other than a moving show\n    Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go\n    Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held\n    In Midnight by the Master of the Show.\n\n\nBut \"the Master of the Show,\" in this case, was Dr. Fu-Manchu!\n\nI have been asked many times since the days with which these records\ndeal: Who WAS Dr. Fu-Manchu?  Let me confess here that my final answer\nmust be postponed.  I can only indicate, at this place, the trend of my\nreasoning, and leave my reader to form whatever conclusion he pleases.\n\nWhat group can we isolate and label as responsible for the overthrow of\nthe Manchus?  The casual student of modern Chinese history will reply:\n\"Young China.\"  This is unsatisfactory.  What do we mean by Young\nChina?  In my own hearing Fu-Manchu had disclaimed, with scorn,\nassociation with the whole of that movement; and assuming that the name\nwere not an assumed one, he clearly can have been no anti-Manchu, no\nRepublican.\n\nThe Chinese Republican is of the mandarin class, but of a new\ngeneration which veneers its Confucianism with Western polish.  These\nyouthful and unbalanced reformers, in conjunction with older but no\nless ill-balanced provincial politicians, may be said to represent\nYoung China.  Amid such turmoils as this we invariably look for, and\ninvariably find, a Third Party.  In my opinion, Dr. Fu-Manchu was one\nof the leaders of such a party.\n\nAnother question often put to me was:  Where did the Doctor hide during\nthe time that he pursued his operations in London?  This is more\nsusceptible of explanation.  For a time Nayland Smith supposed, as I\ndid myself, that the opium den adjacent to the old Ratcliff Highway was\nthe Chinaman's base of operations; later we came to believe that the\nmansion near Windsor was his hiding-place, and later still, the hulk\nlying off the downstream flats.  But I think I can state with\nconfidence that the spot which he had chosen for his home was neither\nof these, but the East End riverside building which I was the first to\nenter.  Of this I am all but sure; for the reason that it not only was\nthe home of Fu-Manchu, of Karamaneh, and of her brother, Aziz, but the\nhome of something else--of something which I shall speak of later.\n\nThe dreadful tragedy (or series of tragedies) which attended the raid\nupon the place will always mark in my memory the supreme horror of a\nhorrible case.  Let me endeavor to explain what occurred.\n\nBy the aid of Karamaneh, you have seen how we had located the whilom\nwarehouse, which, from the exterior, was so drab and dreary, but which\nwithin was a place of wondrous luxury.  At the moment selected by our\nbeautiful accomplice, Inspector Weymouth and a body of detectives\nentirely surrounded it; a river police launch lay off the wharf which\nopened from it on the river-side; and this upon a singularly black\nnight, than which a better could not have been chosen.\n\n\"You will fulfill your promise to me?\" said Karamaneh, and looked up\ninto my face.\n\nShe was enveloped in a big, loose cloak, and from the shadow of the\nhood her wonderful eyes gleamed out like stars.\n\n\"What do you wish us to do?\" asked Nayland Smith.\n\n\"You--and Dr. Petrie,\" she replied swiftly, \"must enter first, and\nbring out Aziz.  Until he is safe--until he is out of that place--you\nare to make no attempt upon--\"\n\n\"Upon Dr. Fu-Manchu?\" interrupted Weymouth; for Karamaneh hesitated to\npronounce the dreaded name, as she always did.  \"But how can we be sure\nthat there is no trap laid for us?\"\n\nThe Scotland Yard man did not entirely share my confidence in the\nintegrity of this Eastern girl whom he knew to have been a creature of\nthe Chinaman's.\n\n\"Aziz lies in the private room,\" she explained eagerly, her old accent\nmore noticeable than usual.  \"There is only one of the Burmese men in\nthe house, and he--he dare not enter without orders!\"\n\n\"But Fu-Manchu?\"\n\n\"We have nothing to fear from him.  He will be your prisoner within ten\nminutes from now!  I have no time for words--you must believe!\"  She\nstamped her foot impatiently.  \"And the dacoit?\" snapped Smith.\n\n\"He also.\"\n\n\"I think perhaps I'd better come in, too,\" said Weymouth slowly.\n\nKaramaneh shrugged her shoulders with quick impatience, and unlocked\nthe door in the high brick wall which divided the gloomy, evil-smelling\ncourt from the luxurious apartments of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\n\"Make no noise,\" she warned.  And Smith and myself followed her along\nthe uncarpeted passage beyond.\n\nInspector Weymouth, with a final word of instruction to his second in\ncommand, brought up the rear.  The door was reclosed; a few paces\nfarther on a second was unlocked.  Passing through a small room,\nunfurnished, a farther passage led us to a balcony.  The transition was\nstartling.\n\nDarkness was about us now, and silence:  a perfumed, slumberous\ndarkness--a silence full of mystery.  For, beyond the walls of the\napartment whereon we looked down waged the unceasing battle of sounds\nthat is the hymn of the great industrial river.  About the scented\nconfines which bounded us now floated the smoke-laden vapors of the\nLower Thames.\n\nFrom the metallic but infinitely human clangor of dock-side life, from\nthe unpleasant but homely odors which prevail where ships swallow in\nand belch out the concrete evidences of commercial prosperity, we had\ncome into this incensed stillness, where one shaded lamp painted dim\nenlargements of its Chinese silk upon the nearer walls, and left the\ngreater part of the room the darker for its contrast.\n\nNothing of the Thames-side activity--of the riveting and scraping--the\nbumping of bales--the bawling of orders--the hiss of steam--penetrated\nto this perfumed place.  In the pool of tinted light lay the deathlike\nfigure of a dark-haired boy, Karamaneh's muffled form bending over him.\n\n\"At last I stand in the house of Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" whispered Smith.\n\nDespite the girl's assurance, we knew that proximity to the sinister\nChinaman must be fraught with danger.  We stood, not in the lion's den,\nbut in the serpent's lair.\n\nFrom the time when Nayland Smith had come from Burma in pursuit of this\nadvance-guard of a cogent Yellow Peril, the face of Dr. Fu-Manchu\nrarely had been absent from my dreams day or night.  The millions might\nsleep in peace--the millions in whose cause we labored!--but we who\nknew the reality of the danger knew that a veritable octopus had\nfastened upon England--a yellow octopus whose head was that of Dr.\nFu-Manchu, whose tentacles were dacoity, thuggee, modes of death,\nsecret and swift, which in the darkness plucked men from life and left\nno clew behind.\n\n\"Karamaneh!\" I called softly.\n\nThe muffled form beneath the lamp turned so that the soft light fell\nupon the lovely face of the slave girl.  She who had been a pliant\ninstrument in the hands of Fu-Manchu now was to be the means whereby\nsociety should be rid of him.\n\nShe raised her finger warningly; then beckoned me to approach.\n\nMy feet sinking in the rich pile of the carpet, I came through the\ngloom of the great apartment in to the patch of light, and, Karamaneh\nbeside me, stood looking down upon the boy.  It was Aziz, her brother;\ndead so far as Western lore had power to judge, but kept alive in that\ndeathlike trance by the uncanny power of the Chinese doctor.\n\n\"Be quick,\" she said; \"be quick!  Awaken him!  I am afraid.\"\n\nFrom the case which I carried I took out a needle-syringe and a phial\ncontaining a small quantity of amber-hued liquid.  It was a drug not to\nbe found in the British Pharmacopoeia.  Of its constitution I knew\nnothing.  Although I had had the phial in my possession for some days I\nhad not dared to devote any of its precious contents to analytical\npurposes.  The amber drops spelled life for the boy Aziz, spelled\nsuccess for the mission of Nayland Smith, spelled ruin for the fiendish\nChinaman.\n\nI raised the white coverlet.  The boy, fully dressed, lay with his arms\ncrossed upon his breast.  I discerned the mark of previous injections\nas, charging the syringe from the phial, I made what I hoped would be\nthe last of such experiments upon him.  I would have given half of my\nsmall worldly possessions to have known the real nature of the drug\nwhich was now coursing through the veins of Aziz--which was tinting the\ngrayed face with the olive tone of life; which, so far as my medical\ntraining bore me, was restoring the dead to life.\n\nBut such was not the purpose of my visit.  I was come to remove from\nthe house of Dr. Fu-Manchu the living chain which bound Karamaneh to\nhim.  The boy alive and free, the Doctor's hold upon the slave girl\nwould be broken.\n\nMy lovely companion, her hands convulsively clasped, knelt and devoured\nwith her eyes the face of the boy who was passing through the most\namazing physiological change in the history of therapeutics.  The\npeculiar perfume which she wore--which seemed to be a part of\nher--which always I associated with her--was faintly perceptible.\nKaramaneh was breathing rapidly.\n\n\"You have nothing to fear,\" I whispered; \"see, he is reviving.  In a\nfew moments all will be well with him.\"\n\nThe hanging lamp with its garishly colored shade swung gently above us,\nwafted, it seemed, by some draught which passed through the apartment.\nThe boy's heavy lids began to quiver, and Karamaneh nervously clutched\nmy arm, and held me so whilst we watched for the long-lashed eyes to\nopen.  The stillness of the place was positively unnatural; it seemed\ninconceivable that all about us was the discordant activity of the\ncommercial East End.  Indeed, this eerie silence was becoming\noppressive; it began positively to appall me.\n\nInspector Weymouth's wondering face peeped over my shoulder.\n\n\"Where is Dr. Fu-Manchu?\" I whispered, as Nayland Smith in turn\nappeared beside me.  \"I cannot understand the silence of the house--\"\n\n\"Look about,\" replied Karamaneh, never taking her eyes from the face of\nAziz.\n\nI peered around the shadowy walls.  Tall glass cases there were,\nshelves and niches:  where once, from the gallery above, I had seen the\ntubes and retorts, the jars of unfamiliar organisms, the books of\nunfamiliar lore, the impedimenta of the occult student and man of\nscience--the visible evidences of Fu-Manchu's presence.\nShelves--cases--niches--were bare.  Of the complicated appliances\nunknown to civilized laboratories, wherewith he pursued his strange\nexperiments, of the tubes wherein he isolated the bacilli of\nunclassified diseases, of the yellow-bound volumes for a glimpse at\nwhich (had they known of their contents) the great men of Harley Street\nwould have given a fortune--no trace remained.  The silken cushions;\nthe inlaid tables; all were gone.\n\nThe room was stripped, dismantled.  Had Fu-Manchu fled?  The silence\nassumed a new significance.  His dacoits and kindred ministers of death\nall must have fled, too.\n\n\"You have let him escape us!\" I said rapidly.  \"You promised to aid us\nto capture him--to send us a message--and you have delayed until--\"\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"no!\" and clutched at my arm again.  \"Oh!  is he not\nreviving slowly?  Are you sure you have made no mistake?\"\n\nHer thoughts were all for the boy; and her solicitude touched me.  I\nagain examined Aziz, the most remarkable patient of my busy\nprofessional career.\n\nAs I counted the strengthening pulse, he opened his dark eyes--which\nwere so like the eyes of Karamaneh--and, with the girl's eager arms\ntightly about him, sat up, looking wonderingly around.\n\nKaramaneh pressed her cheek to his, whispering loving words in that\nsoftly spoken Arabic which had first betrayed her nationality to\nNayland Smith.  I handed her my flask, which I had filled with wine.\n\n\"My promise is fulfilled!\" I said.  \"You are free!  Now for Fu-Manchu!\nBut first let us admit the police to this house; there is something\nuncanny in its stillness.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied.  \"First let my brother be taken out and placed in\nsafety.  Will you carry him?\"\n\nShe raised her face to that of Inspector Weymouth, upon which was\nwritten awe and wonder.\n\nThe burly detective lifted the boy as tenderly as a woman, passed\nthrough the shadows to the stairway, ascended, and was swallowed up in\nthe gloom.  Nayland Smith's eyes gleamed feverishly.  He turned to\nKaramaneh.\n\n\"You are not playing with us?\" he said harshly.  \"We have done our\npart; it remains for you to do yours.\"\n\n\"Do not speak so loudly,\" the girl begged.  \"HE is near us--and, oh,\nGod, I fear him so!\"\n\n\"Where is he?\" persisted my friend.\n\nKaramaneh's eyes were glassy with fear now.\n\n\"You must not touch him until the police are here,\" she said--but from\nthe direction of her quick, agitated glances I knew that, her brother\nsafe now, she feared for me, and for me alone.  Those glances sent my\nblood dancing; for Karamaneh was an Eastern jewel which any man of\nflesh and blood must have coveted had he known it to lie within his\nreach.  Her eyes were twin lakes of mystery which, more than once, I\nhad known the desire to explore.\n\n\"Look--beyond that curtain\"--her voice was barely audible--\"but do not\nenter.  Even as he is, I fear him.\"\n\nHer voice, her palpable agitation, prepared us for something\nextraordinary.  Tragedy and Fu-Manchu were never far apart.  Though we\nwere two, and help was so near, we were in the abode of the most\ncunning murderer who ever came out of the East.\n\nIt was with strangely mingled emotions that I crossed the thick carpet,\nNayland Smith beside me, and drew aside the draperies concealing a\ndoor, to which Karamaneh had pointed.  Then, upon looking into the dim\nplace beyond, all else save what it held was forgotten.\n\nWe looked upon a small, square room, the walls draped with fantastic\nChinese tapestry, the floor strewn with cushions; and reclining in a\ncorner, where the faint, blue light from a lamp, placed upon a low\ntable, painted grotesque shadows about the cavernous face--was Dr.\nFu-Manchu!\n\nAt sight of him my heart leaped--and seemed to suspend its functions,\nso intense was the horror which this man's presence inspired in me.  My\nhand clutching the curtain, I stood watching him.  The lids veiled the\nmalignant green eyes, but the thin lips seemed to smile.  Then Smith\nsilently pointed to the hand which held a little pipe.  A sickly\nperfume assailed my nostrils, and the explanation of the hushed\nsilence, and the ease with which we had thus far executed our plan,\ncame to me.  The cunning mind was torpid--lost in a brutish world of\ndreams.\n\nFu-Manchu was in an opium sleep!\n\nThe dim light traced out a network of tiny lines, which covered the\nyellow face from the pointed chin to the top of the great domed brow,\nand formed deep shadow pools in the hollows beneath his eyes.  At last\nwe had triumphed.\n\nI could not determine the depth of his obscene trance; and mastering\nsome of my repugnance, and forgetful of Karamaneh's warning, I was\nabout to step forward into the room, loaded with its nauseating opium\nfumes, when a soft breath fanned my cheek.\n\n\"Do not go in!\" came Karamaneh's warning voice--hushed--trembling.\n\nHer little hand grasped my arm.  She drew Smith and myself back from\nthe door.\n\n\"There is danger there!\" she whispered.\n\n\"Do not enter that room!  The police must reach him in some way--and\ndrag him out!  Do not enter that room!\"\n\nThe girl's voice quivered hysterically; her eyes blazed into savage\nflame.  The fierce resentment born of dreadful wrongs was consuming her\nnow; but fear of Fu-Manchu held her yet.  Inspector Weymouth came down\nthe stairs and joined us.\n\n\"I have sent the boy to Ryman's room at the station,\" he said.  \"The\ndivisional surgeon will look after him until you arrive, Dr. Petrie.\nAll is ready now.  The launch is just off the wharf and every side of\nthe place under observation.  Where's our man?\"\n\nHe drew a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and raised his eyebrows\ninterrogatively.  The absence of sound--of any demonstration from the\nuncanny Chinaman whom he was there to arrest--puzzled him.\n\nNayland Smith jerked his thumb toward the curtain.\n\nAt that, and before we could utter a word, Weymouth stepped to the\ndraped door.  He was a man who drove straight at his goal and saved\nreflections for subsequent leisure.  I think, moreover, that the\natmosphere of the place (stripped as it was it retained its heavy,\nvoluptuous perfume) had begun to get a hold upon him.  He was anxious\nto shake it off; to be up and doing.\n\nHe pulled the curtain aside and stepped into the room.  Smith and I\nperforce followed him.  Just within the door the three of us stood\nlooking across at the limp thing which had spread terror throughout the\nEastern and Western world.  Helpless as Fu-Manchu was, he inspired\nterror now, though the giant intellect was inert--stupefied.\n\nIn the dimly lit apartment we had quitted I heard Karamaneh utter a\nstifled scream.  But it came too late.\n\nAs though cast up by a volcano, the silken cushions, the inlaid table\nwith its blue-shaded lamp, the garish walls, the sprawling figure with\nthe ghastly light playing upon its features--quivered, and shot upward!\n\nSo it seemed to me; though, in the ensuing instant I remembered, too\nlate, a previous experience of the floors of Fu-Manchu's private\napartments; I knew what had indeed befallen us.  A trap had been\nreleased beneath our feet.\n\nI recall falling--but have no recollection of the end of my fall--of\nthe shock marking the drop.  I only remember fighting for my life\nagainst a stifling something which had me by the throat.  I knew that I\nwas being suffocated, but my hands met only the deathly emptiness.\n\nInto a poisonous well of darkness I sank.  I could not cry out.  I was\nhelpless.  Of the fate of my companions I knew nothing--could surmise\nnothing.  Then . . . all consciousness ended.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nI WAS being carried along a dimly lighted, tunnel-like place, slung,\nsackwise, across the shoulder of a Burman.  He was not a big man, but\nhe supported my considerable weight with apparent ease.  A deadly\nnausea held me, but the rough handling had served to restore me to\nconsciousness.  My hands and feet were closely lashed.  I hung limply\nas a wet towel: I felt that this spark of tortured life which had\nflickered up in me must ere long finally become extinguished.\n\nA fancy possessed me, in these the first moments of my restoration to\nthe world of realities, that I had been smuggled into China; and as I\nswung head downward I told myself that the huge, puffy things which\nstrewed the path were a species of giant toadstool, unfamiliar to me\nand possibly peculiar to whatever district of China I now was in.\n\nThe air was hot, steamy, and loaded with a smell as of rotting\nvegetation.  I wondered why my bearer so scrupulously avoided touching\nany of the unwholesome-looking growths in passing through what seemed a\nsuccession of cellars, but steered a tortuous course among the bloated,\nunnatural shapes, lifting his bare brown feet with a catlike delicacy.\n\nHe passed under a low arch, dropped me roughly to the ground and ran\nback.  Half stunned, I lay watching the agile brown body melt into the\ndistances of the cellars.  Their walls and roof seemed to emit a faint,\nphosphorescent light.\n\n\"Petrie!\" came a weak voice from somewhere ahead. . . .  \"Is that you,\nPetrie?\"\n\nIt was Nayland Smith!\n\n\"Smith!\" I said, and strove to sit up.  But the intense nausea overcame\nme, so that I all but swooned.\n\nI heard his voice again, but could attach no meaning to the words which\nhe uttered.  A sound of terrific blows reached my ears, too.  The\nBurman reappeared, bending under the heavy load which he bore.  For, as\nhe picked his way through the bloated things which grew upon the floors\nof the cellars, I realized that he was carrying the inert body of\nInspector Weymouth.  And I found time to compare the strength of the\nlittle brown man with that of a Nile beetle, which can raise many times\nits own weight.  Then, behind him, appeared a second figure, which\nimmediately claimed the whole of my errant attention.\n\n\"Fu-Manchu!\" hissed my friend, from the darkness which concealed him.\n\nIt was indeed none other than Fu-Manchu--the Fu-Manchu whom we had\nthought to be helpless.  The deeps of the Chinaman's cunning--the fine\nquality of his courage, were forced upon me as amazing facts.\n\nHe had assumed the appearance of a drugged opium-smoker so well as to\ndupe me--a medical man; so well as to dupe Karamaneh--whose experience\nof the noxious habit probably was greater than my own.  And, with the\ngallows dangling before him, he had waited--played the part of a\nlure--whilst a body of police actually surrounded the place!\n\nI have since thought that the room probably was one which he actually\nused for opium debauches, and the device of the trap was intended to\nprotect him during the comatose period.\n\nNow, holding a lantern above his head, the deviser of the trap\nwhereinto we, mouselike, had blindly entered, came through the cellars,\nfollowing the brown man who carried Weymouth.  The faint rays of the\nlantern (it apparently contained a candle) revealed a veritable forest\nof the gigantic fungi--poisonously colored--hideously swollen--climbing\nfrom the floor up the slimy walls--climbing like horrid parasites to\nsuch part of the arched roof as was visible to me.\n\nFu-Manchu picked his way through the fungi ranks as daintily as though\nthe distorted, tumid things had been viper-headed.\n\nThe resounding blows which I had noted before, and which had never\nceased, culminated in a splintering crash.  Dr. Fu-Manchu and his\nservant, who carried the apparently insensible detective, passed in\nunder the arch, Fu-Manchu glancing back once along the passages.  The\nlantern he extinguished, or concealed; and whilst I waited, my mind\ndully surveying memories of all the threats which this uncanny being\nhad uttered, a distant clamor came to my ears.\n\nThen, abruptly, it ceased.  Dr. Fu-Manchu had closed a heavy door; and\nto my surprise I perceived that the greater part of it was of glass.\nThe will-o'-the-wisp glow which played around the fungi rendered the\nvista of the cellars faintly luminous, and visible to me from where I\nlay.  Fu-Manchu spoke softly.  His voice, its guttural note alternating\nwith a sibilance on certain words, betrayed no traces of agitation.\nThe man's unbroken calm had in it something inhuman.  For he had just\nperpetrated an act of daring unparalleled in my experience, and, in the\nclamor now shut out by the glass door I tardily recognized the entrance\nof the police into some barricaded part of the house--the coming of\nthose who would save us--who would hold the Chinese doctor for the\nhangman!\n\n\"I have decided,\" he said deliberately, \"that you are more worthy of my\nattention than I had formerly supposed.  A man who can solve the secret\nof the Golden Elixir (I had not solved it; I had merely stolen some)\nshould be a valuable acquisition to my Council.  The extent of the\nplans of Mr. Commissioner Nayland Smith and of the English Scotland\nYard it is incumbent upon me to learn.  Therefore, gentlemen, you\nlive--for the present!\"\n\n\"And you'll swing,\" came Weymouth's hoarse voice, \"in the near future!\nYou and all your yellow gang!\"\n\n\"I trust not,\" was the placid reply.  \"Most of my people are safe: some\nare shipped as lascars upon the liners; others have departed by\ndifferent means.  Ah!\"\n\nThat last word was the only one indicative of excitement which had yet\nescaped him.  A disk of light danced among the brilliant poison hues of\nthe passages--but no sound reached us; by which I knew that the glass\ndoor must fit almost hermetically.  It was much cooler here than in the\nplace through which we had passed, and the nausea began to leave me, my\nbrain to grow more clear.  Had I known what was to follow I should have\ncursed the lucidity of mind which now came to me; I should have prayed\nfor oblivion--to be spared the sight of that which ensued.\n\n\"It's Logan!\" cried Inspector Weymouth; and I could tell that he was\nstruggling to free himself of his bonds.  From his voice it was evident\nthat he, too, was recovering from the effects of the narcotic which had\nbeen administered to us all.\n\n\"Logan!\" he cried.  \"Logan!  This way--HELP!\"\n\nBut the cry beat back upon us in that enclosed space and seemed to\ncarry no farther than the invisible walls of our prison.\n\n\"The door fits well,\" came Fu-Manchu's mocking voice.  \"It is fortunate\nfor us all that it is so.  This is my observation window, Dr. Petrie,\nand you are about to enjoy an unique opportunity of studying fungology.\nI have already drawn your attention to the anaesthetic properties of\nthe lycoperdon, or common puff-ball. You may have recognized the fumes?\nThe chamber into which you rashly precipitated yourselves was charged\nwith them.  By a process of my own I have greatly enhanced the value of\nthe puff-ball in this respect.  Your friend, Mr. Weymouth, proved the\nmost obstinate subject; but he succumbed in fifteen seconds.\"\n\n\"Logan!  Help!  HELP!  This way, man!\"\n\nSomething very like fear sounded in Weymouth's voice now.  Indeed, the\nsituation was so uncanny that it almost seemed unreal.  A group of men\nhad entered the farthermost cellars, led by one who bore an electric\npocket-lamp. The hard, white ray danced from bloated gray fungi to\nothers of nightmare shape, of dazzling, venomous brilliance.  The\nmocking, lecture-room voice continued:\n\n\"Note the snowy growth upon the roof, Doctor.  Do not be deceived by\nits size.  It is a giant variety of my own culture and is of the order\nempusa. You, in England, are familiar with the death of the common\nhouse-fly--which is found attached to the window-pane by a coating of\nwhite mold.  I have developed the spores of this mold and have produced\na giant species.  Observe the interesting effect of the strong light\nupon my orange and blue amanita fungus!\"\n\nHard beside me I heard Nayland Smith groan, Weymouth had become\nsuddenly silent.  For my own part, I could have shrieked in pure\nhorror.  FOR I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING. I realized in one agonized instant\nthe significance of the dim lantern, of the careful progress through\nthe subterranean fungi grove, of the care with which Fu-Manchu and his\nservant had avoided touching any of the growths.  I knew, now, that Dr.\nFu-Manchu was the greatest fungologist the world had ever known; was a\npoisoner to whom the Borgias were as children--and I knew that the\ndetectives blindly were walking into a valley of death.\n\nThen it began--the unnatural scene--the saturnalia of murder.\n\nLike so many bombs the brilliantly colored caps of the huge\ntoadstool-like things alluded to by the Chinaman exploded, as the white\nray sought them out in the darkness which alone preserved their\nexistence.  A brownish cloud--I could not determine whether liquid or\npowdery--arose in the cellar.\n\nI tried to close my eyes--or to turn them away from the reeling forms\nof the men who were trapped in that poison-hole. It was useless:\n\nI must look.\n\nThe bearer of the lamp had dropped it, but the dim, eerily illuminated\ngloom endured scarce a second.  A bright light sprang up--doubtless at\nthe touch of the fiendish being who now resumed speech:\n\n\"Observe the symptoms of delirium, Doctor!\"  Out there, beyond the\nglass door, the unhappy victims were laughing--tearing their garments\nfrom their bodies--leaping--waving their arms--were become MANIACS!\n\n\"We will now release the ripe spores of giant entpusa,\" continued the\nwicked voice.  \"The air of the second cellar being super-charged with\noxygen, they immediately germinate.  Ah!  it is a triumph!  That\nprocess is the scientific triumph of my life!\"\n\nLike powdered snow the white spores fell from the roof, frosting the\nwrithing shapes of the already poisoned men.  Before my horrified gaze,\nTHE FUNGUS GREW; it spread from the head to the feet of those it\ntouched; it enveloped them as in glittering shrouds. . . .\n\n\"They die like flies!\" screamed Fu-Manchu, with a sudden febrile\nexcitement; and I felt assured of something I had long suspected:  that\nthat magnificent, perverted brain was the brain of a homicidal\nmaniac--though Smith would never accept the theory.\n\n\"It is my fly-trap!\" shrieked the Chinaman.  \"And I am the god of\ndestruction!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nTHE clammy touch of the mist revived me.  The culmination of the scene\nin the poison cellars, together with the effects of the fumes which I\nhad inhaled again, had deprived me of consciousness.  Now I knew that I\nwas afloat on the river.  I still was bound: furthermore, a cloth was\nwrapped tightly about my mouth, and I was secured to a ring in the deck.\n\nBy moving my aching head to the left I could look down into the oily\nwater; by moving it to the right I could catch a glimpse of the\nempurpled face of Inspector Weymouth, who, similarly bound and gagged,\nlay beside me, but only of the feet and legs of Nayland Smith.  For I\ncould not turn my head sufficiently far to see more.\n\nWe were aboard an electric launch.  I heard the hated guttural voice of\nFu-Manchu, subdued now to its habitual calm, and my heart leaped to\nhear the voice that answered him.  It was that of Karamaneh.  His\ntriumph was complete.  Clearly his plans for departure were complete;\nhis slaughter of the police in the underground passages had been a\nfinal reckless demonstration of which the Chinaman's subtle cunning\nwould have been incapable had he not known his escape from the country\nto be assured.\n\nWhat fate was in store for us?  How would he avenge himself upon the\ngirl who had betrayed him to his enemies?  What portion awaited those\nenemies?  He seemed to have formed the singular determination to\nsmuggle me into China--but what did he purpose in the case of Weymouth,\nand in the case of Nayland Smith?\n\nAll but silently we were feeling our way through the mist.  Astern died\nthe clangor of dock and wharf into a remote discord.  Ahead hung the\nfoggy curtain veiling the traffic of the great waterway; but through it\nbroke the calling of sirens, the tinkling of bells.\n\nThe gentle movement of the screw ceased altogether.  The launch lay\nheaving slightly upon the swells.\n\nA distant throbbing grew louder--and something advanced upon us through\nthe haze.\n\nA bell rang and muffled by the fog a voice proclaimed itself--a voice\nwhich I knew.  I felt Weymouth writhing impotently beside me; heard him\nmumbling incoherently; and I knew that he, too, had recognized the\nvoice.\n\nIt was that of Inspector Ryman of the river police and their launch was\nwithin biscuit-throw of that upon which we lay!\n\n\"'Hoy!  'Hoy!\"\n\nI trembled.  A feverish excitement claimed me.  They were hailing us.\nWe carried no lights; but now--and ignoring the pain which shot from my\nspine to my skull I craned my neck to the left--the port light of the\npolice launch glowed angrily through the mist.\n\nI was unable to utter any save mumbling sounds, and my companions were\nequally helpless.  It was a desperate position.  Had the police seen us\nor had they hailed at random?  The light drew nearer.\n\n\"Launch, 'hoy!\"\n\nThey had seen us!  Fu-Manchu's guttural voice spoke shortly--and our\nscrew began to revolve again; we leaped ahead into the bank of\ndarkness.  Faint grew the light of the police launch--and was gone.\nBut I heard Ryman's voice shouting.\n\n\"Full speed!\" came faintly through the darkness.  \"Port!  Port!\"\n\nThen the murk closed down, and with our friends far astern of us we\nwere racing deeper into the fog banks--speeding seaward; though of this\nI was unable to judge at the time.\n\nOn we raced, and on, sweeping over growing swells.  Once, a black,\ntowering shape dropped down upon us.  Far above, lights blazed, bells\nrang, vague cries pierced the fog.  The launch pitched and rolled\nperilously, but weathered the wash of the liner which so nearly had\nconcluded this episode.  It was such a journey as I had taken once\nbefore, early in our pursuit of the genius of the Yellow Peril; but\nthis was infinitely more terrible; for now we were utterly in\nFu-Manchu's power.\n\nA voice mumbled in my ear.  I turned my bound-up face; and Inspector\nWeymouth raised his hands in the dimness and partly slipped the bandage\nfrom his mouth.\n\n\"I've been working at the cords since we left those filthy cellars,\" he\nwhispered.  \"My wrists are all cut, but when I've got out a knife and\nfreed my ankles--\"\n\nSmith had kicked him with his bound feet.  The detective slipped the\nbandage back to position and placed his hands behind him again.  Dr.\nFu-Manchu, wearing a heavy overcoat but no hat, came aft.  He was\ndragging Karamaneh by the wrists.  He seated himself on the cushions\nnear to us, pulling the girl down beside him.  Now, I could see her\nface--and the expression in her beautiful eyes made me writhe.\n\nFu-Manchu was watching us, his discolored teeth faintly visible in the\ndim light, to which my eyes were becoming accustomed.\n\n\"Dr. Petrie,\" he said, \"you shall be my honored guest at my home in\nChina.  You shall assist me to revolutionize chemistry.  Mr. Smith, I\nfear you know more of my plans than I had deemed it possible for you to\nhave learned, and I am anxious to know if you have a confidant.  Where\nyour memory fails you, and my files and wire jackets prove ineffectual,\nInspector Weymouth's recollections may prove more accurate.\"\n\nHe turned to the cowering girl--who shrank away from him in pitiful,\nabject terror.\n\n\"In my hands, Doctor,\" he continued, \"I hold a needle charged with a\nrare culture.  It is the link between the bacilli and the fungi.  You\nhave seemed to display an undue interest in the peach and pearl which\nrender my Karamaneh so delightful, In the supple grace of her movements\nand the sparkle of her eyes.  You can never devote your whole mind to\nthose studies which I have planned for you whilst such distractions\nexist.  A touch of this keen point, and the laughing Karamaneh becomes\nthe shrieking hag--the maniacal, mowing--\"\n\nThen, with an ox-like rush, Weymouth was upon him!\n\nKaramaneh, wrought upon past endurance, with a sobbing cry, sank to the\ndeck--and lay still.  I managed to writhe into a half-sitting posture,\nand Smith rolled aside as the detective and the Chinaman crashed down\ntogether.\n\nWeymouth had one big hand at the Doctor's yellow throat; with his left\nhe grasped the Chinaman's right.  It held the needle.\n\nNow, I could look along the length of the little craft, and, so far as\nit was possible to make out in the fog, only one other was aboard--the\nhalf-clad brown man who navigated her--and who had carried us through\nthe cellars.  The murk had grown denser and now shut us in like a box.\nThe throb of the motor--the hissing breath of the two who fought--with\nso much at issue--these sounds and the wash of the water alone broke\nthe eerie stillness.\n\nBy slow degrees, and with a reptilian agility horrible to watch,\nFu-Manchu was neutralizing the advantage gained by Weymouth.  His\nclawish fingers were fast in the big man's throat; the right hand with\nits deadly needle was forcing down the left of his opponent.  He had\nbeen underneath, but now he was gaining the upper place.  His powers of\nphysical endurance must have been truly marvelous.  His breath was\nwhistling through his nostrils significantly, but Weymouth was palpably\ntiring.\n\nThe latter suddenly changed his tactics.  By a supreme effort, to which\nhe was spurred, I think, by the growing proximity of the needle, he\nraised Fu-Manchu--by the throat and arm--and pitched him sideways.\n\nThe Chinaman's grip did not relax, and the two wrestlers dropped, a\nwrithing mass, upon the port cushions.  The launch heeled over, and my\ncry of horror was crushed back into my throat by the bandage.  For, as\nFu-Manchu sought to extricate himself, he overbalanced--fell back--and,\nbearing Weymouth with him--slid into the river!\n\nThe mist swallowed them up.\n\nThere are moments of which no man can recall his mental impressions,\nmoments so acutely horrible that, mercifully, our memory retains\nnothing of the emotions they occasioned.  This was one of them.  A\nchaos ruled in my mind.  I had a vague belief that the Burman, forward,\nglanced back.  Then the course of the launch was changed.  How long\nintervened between the tragic end of that Gargantuan struggle and the\ntime when a black wall leaped suddenly up before us I cannot pretend to\nstate.\n\nWith a sickening jerk we ran aground.  A loud explosion ensued, and I\nclearly remember seeing the brown man leap out into the fog--which was\nthe last I saw of him.\n\nWater began to wash aboard.\n\nFully alive to our imminent peril, I fought with the cords that bound\nme; but I lacked poor Weymouth's strength of wrist, and I began to\naccept as a horrible and imminent possibility, a death from drowning,\nwithin six feet of the bank.\n\nBeside me, Nayland Smith was straining and twisting.  I think his\nobject was to touch Karamaneh, in the hope of arousing her.  Where he\nfailed in his project, the inflowing water succeeded.  A silent prayer\nof thankfulness came from my very soul when I saw her stir--when I saw\nher raise her hands to her head--and saw the big, horror-bright eyes\ngleam through the mist veil.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nWE quitted the wrecked launch but a few seconds before her stern\nsettled down into the river.  Where the mud-bank upon which we found\nourselves was situated we had no idea.  But at least it was terra firma\nand we were free from Dr. Fu-Manchu.\n\nSmith stood looking out towards the river.\n\n\"My God!\" he groaned.  \"My God!\"\n\nHe was thinking, as I was, of Weymouth.\n\nAnd when, an hour later, the police boat located us (on the mud-flats\nbelow Greenwich) and we heard that the toll of the poison cellars was\neight men, we also heard news of our brave companion.\n\n\"Back there in the fog, sir,\" reported Inspector Ryman, who was in\ncharge, and his voice was under poor command, \"there was an uncanny\nhowling, and peals of laughter that I'm going to dream about for\nweeks--\"\n\nKaramaneh, who nestled beside me like a frightened child, shivered; and\nI knew that the needle had done its work, despite Weymouth's giant\nstrength.\n\nSmith swallowed noisily.\n\n\"Pray God the river has that yellow Satan,\" he said.  \"I would\nsacrifice a year of my life to see his rat's body on the end of a\ngrappling-iron!\"\n\nWe were a sad party that steamed through the fog homeward that night.\nIt seemed almost like deserting a staunch comrade to leave the spot--so\nnearly as we could locate it--where Weymouth had put up that last\ngallant fight.  Our helplessness was pathetic, and although, had the\nnight been clear as crystal, I doubt if we could have acted otherwise,\nit came to me that this stinking murk was a new enemy which drove us\nback in coward retreat.\n\nBut so many were the calls upon our activity, and so numerous the\nstimulants to our initiative in those times, that soon we had matter to\nrelieve our minds from this stress of sorrow.\n\nThere was Karamaneh to be considered--Karamaneh and her brother.  A\nbrief counsel was held, whereat it was decided that for the present\nthey should be lodged at a hotel.\n\n\"I shall arrange,\" Smith whispered to me, for the girl was watching us,\n\"to have the place patrolled night and day.\"\n\n\"You cannot suppose--\"\n\n\"Petrie!  I cannot and dare not suppose Fu-Manchu dead until with my\nown eyes I have seen him so!\"\n\nAccordingly we conveyed the beautiful Oriental girl and her brother\naway from that luxurious abode in its sordid setting.  I will not dwell\nupon the final scene in the poison cellars lest I be accused of\naccumulating horror for horror's sake.  Members of the fire brigade,\nhelmed against contagion, brought out the bodies of the victims wrapped\nin their living shrouds. . . .\n\nFrom Karamaneh we learned much of Fu-Manchu, little of herself.\n\n\"What am I?  Does my poor history matter--to anyone?\" was her answer to\nquestions respecting herself.\n\nAnd she would droop her lashes over her dark eyes.\n\nThe dacoits whom the Chinaman had brought to England originally\nnumbered seven, we learned.  As you, having followed me thus far, will\nbe aware, we had thinned the ranks of the Burmans.  Probably only one\nnow remained in England.  They had lived in a camp in the grounds of\nthe house near Windsor (which, as we had learned at the time of its\ndestruction, the Doctor had bought outright). The Thames had been his\nhighway.\n\nOther members of the group had occupied quarters in various parts of\nthe East End, where sailormen of all nationalities congregate.\nShen-Yan's had been the East End headquarters.  He had employed the\nhulk from the time of his arrival, as a laboratory for a certain class\nof experiments undesirable in proximity to a place of residence.\n\nNayland Smith asked the girl on one occasion if the Chinaman had had a\nprivate sea-going vessel, and she replied in the affirmative.  She had\nnever been on board, however, had never even set eyes upon it, and\ncould give us no information respecting its character.  It had sailed\nfor China.\n\n\"You are sure,\" asked Smith keenly, \"that it has actually left?\"\n\n\"I understood so, and that we were to follow by another route.\"\n\n\"It would have been difficult for Fu-Manchu to travel by a passenger\nboat?\"\n\n\"I cannot say what were his plans.\"\n\nIn a state of singular uncertainty, then, readily to be understood, we\npassed the days following the tragedy which had deprived us of our\nfellow-worker.\n\nVividly I recall the scene at poor Weymouth's home, on the day that we\nvisited it.  I then made the acquaintance of the Inspector's brother.\nNayland Smith gave him a detailed account of the last scene.\n\n\"Out there in the mist,\" he concluded wearily, \"it all seemed very\nunreal.\"\n\n\"I wish to God it had been!\"\n\n\"Amen to that, Mr. Weymouth.  But your brother made a gallant finish.\nIf ridding the world of Fu-Manchu were the only good deed to his\ncredit, his life had been well spent.\"\n\nJames Weymouth smoked awhile in thoughtful silence.  Though but four\nand a half miles S.S.E. of St. Paul's the quaint little cottage, with\nits rustic garden, shadowed by the tall trees which had so lined the\nvillage street before motor 'buses were, was a spot as peaceful and\nsecluded as any in broad England.  But another shadow lay upon it\nto-day--chilling, fearful.  An incarnate evil had come out of the dim\nEast and in its dying malevolence had touched this home.\n\n\"There are two things I don't understand about it, sir,\" continued\nWeymouth.  \"What was the meaning of the horrible laughter which the\nriver police heard in the fog?  And where are the bodies?\"\n\nKaramaneh, seated beside me, shuddered at the words.  Smith, whose\nrestless spirit granted him little repose, paused in his aimless\nwanderings about the room and looked at her.\n\nIn these latter days of his Augean labors to purge England of the\nunclean thing which had fastened upon her, my friend was more lean and\nnervous-looking than I had ever known him.  His long residence in Burma\nhad rendered him spare and had burned his naturally dark skin to a\ncoppery hue; but now his gray eyes had grown feverishly bright and his\nface so lean as at times to appear positively emaciated.  But I knew\nthat he was as fit as ever.\n\n\"This lady may be able to answer your first question,\" he said.  \"She\nand her brother were for some time in the household of Dr. Fu-Manchu.\nIn fact, Mr. Weymouth, Karamaneh, as her name implies, was a slave.\"\n\nWeymouth glanced at the beautiful, troubled face with scarcely veiled\ndistrust.  \"You don't look as though you had come from China, miss,\" he\nsaid, with a sort of unwilling admiration.\n\n\"I do not come from China,\" replied Karamaneh.  \"My father was a pure\nBedawee.  But my history does not matter.\" (At times there was\nsomething imperious in her manner; and to this her musical accent added\nforce.) \"When your brave brother, Inspector Weymouth, and Dr.\nFu-Manchu, were swallowed up by the river, Fu-Manchu held a poisoned\nneedle in his hand.  The laughter meant that the needle had done its\nwork.  Your brother had become mad!\"\n\nWeymouth turned aside to hide his emotion.  \"What was on the needle?\"\nhe asked huskily.\n\n\"It was something which he prepared from the venom of a kind of swamp\nadder,\" she answered.  \"It produces madness, but not always death.\"\n\n\"He would have had a poor chance,\" said Smith, \"even had he been in\ncomplete possession of his senses.  At the time of the encounter we\nmust have been some considerable distance from shore, and the fog was\nimpenetrable.\"\n\n\"But how do you account for the fact that neither of the bodies have\nbeen recovered?\"\n\n\"Ryman of the river police tells me that persons lost at that point are\nnot always recovered--or not until a considerable time later.\"\n\nThere was a faint sound from the room above.  The news of that tragic\nhappening out in the mist upon the Thames had prostrated poor Mrs.\nWeymouth.\n\n\"She hasn't been told half the truth,\" said her brother-in-law. \"She\ndoesn't know about--the poisoned needle.  What kind of fiend was this\nDr. Fu-Manchu?\" He burst out into a sudden blaze of furious resentment.\n\"John never told me much, and you have let mighty little leak into the\npapers.  What was he?  Who was he?\"\n\nHalf he addressed the words to Smith, half to Karamaneh.\n\n\"Dr. Fu-Manchu,\" replied the former, \"was the ultimate expression of\nChinese cunning; a phenomenon such as occurs but once in many\ngenerations.  He was a superman of incredible genius, who, had he\nwilled, could have revolutionized science.  There is a superstition in\nsome parts of China according to which, under certain peculiar\nconditions (one of which is proximity to a deserted burial-ground) an\nevil spirit of incredible age may enter unto the body of a new-born\ninfant.  All my efforts thus far have not availed me to trace the\ngenealogy of the man called Dr. Fu-Manchu. Even Karamaneh cannot help\nme in this.  But I have sometimes thought that he was a member of a\ncertain very old Kiangsu family--and that the peculiar conditions I\nhave mentioned prevailed at his birth!\"\n\nSmith, observing our looks of amazement, laughed shortly, and quite\nmirthlessly.\n\n\"Poor old Weymouth!\" he jerked.  \"I suppose my labors are finished; but\nI am far from triumphant.  Is there any improvement in Mrs. Weymouth's\ncondition?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" was the reply; \"she has lain in a semi-conscious state\nsince the news came.  No one had any idea she would take it so.  At one\ntime we were afraid her brain was going.  She seemed to have delusions.\"\n\nSmith spun round upon Weymouth.\n\n\"Of what nature?\" he asked rapidly.\n\nThe other pulled nervously at his mustache.\n\n\"My wife has been staying with her,\" he explained, \"since--it happened;\nand for the last three nights poor John's widow has cried out at the\nsame time--half-past two--that someone was knocking on the door.\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"That door yonder--the street door.\"\n\nAll our eyes turned in the direction indicated.\n\n\"John often came home at half-past two from the Yard,\" continued\nWeymouth; \"so we naturally thought poor Mary was wandering in her mind.\nBut last night--and it's not to be wondered at--my wife couldn't sleep,\nand she was wide awake at half-past two.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nNayland Smith was standing before him, alert, bright-eyed.\n\n\"She heard it, too!\"\n\nThe sun was streaming into the cozy little sitting-room; but I will\nconfess that Weymouth's words chilled me uncannily.  Karamaneh laid her\nhand upon mine, in a quaint, childish fashion peculiarly her own.  Her\nhand was cold, but its touch thrilled me.  For Karamaneh was not a\nchild, but a rarely beautiful girl--a pearl of the East such as many a\nmonarch has fought for.\n\n\"What then?\" asked Smith.\n\n\"She was afraid to move--afraid to look from the window!\"\n\nMy friend turned and stared hard at me.\n\n\"A subjective hallucination, Petrie?\"\n\n\"In all probability,\" I replied.  \"You should arrange that your wife be\nrelieved in her trying duties, Mr. Weymouth.  It is too great a strain\nfor an inexperienced nurse.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nOF all that we had hoped for in our pursuit of Fu-Manchu how little had\nwe accomplished.  Excepting Karamaneh and her brother (who were victims\nand not creatures of the Chinese doctor's) not one of the formidable\ngroup had fallen alive into our hands.  Dreadful crimes had marked\nFu-Manchu's passage through the land.  Not one-half of the truth (and\nnothing of the later developments) had been made public.  Nayland\nSmith's authority was sufficient to control the press.\n\nIn the absence of such a veto a veritable panic must have seized upon\nthe entire country; for a monster--a thing more than humanly\nevil--existed in our midst.\n\nAlways Fu-Manchu's secret activities had centered about the great\nwaterway.  There was much of poetic justice in his end; for the Thames\nhad claimed him, who so long had used the stream as a highway for the\npassage to and fro for his secret forces.  Gone now were the yellow men\nwho had been the instruments of his evil will; gone was the giant\nintellect which had controlled the complex murder machine.  Karamaneh,\nwhose beauty he had used as a lure, at last was free, and no more with\nher smile would tempt men to death--that her brother might live.\n\nMany there are, I doubt not, who will regard the Eastern girl with\nhorror.  I ask their forgiveness in that I regarded her quite\ndifferently.  No man having seen her could have condemned her unheard.\nMany, having looked into her lovely eyes, had they found there what I\nfound, must have forgiven her almost any crime.\n\nThat she valued human life but little was no matter for wonder.  Her\nnationality--her history--furnished adequate excuse for an attitude not\ncondonable in a European equally cultured.\n\nBut indeed let me confess that hers was a nature incomprehensible to me\nin some respects.  The soul of Karamaneh was a closed book to my\nshort-sighted Western eyes.  But the body of Karamaneh was exquisite;\nher beauty of a kind that was a key to the most extravagant rhapsodies\nof Eastern poets.  Her eyes held a challenge wholly Oriental in its\nappeal; her lips, even in repose, were a taunt.  And, herein, East is\nWest and West is East.\n\nFinally, despite her lurid history, despite the scornful\nself-possession of which I knew her capable, she was an unprotected\ngirl--in years, I believe, a mere child--whom Fate had cast in my way.\nAt her request, we had booked passages for her brother and herself to\nEgypt.  The boat sailed in three days.  But Karamaneh's beautiful eyes\nwere sad; often I detected tears on the black lashes.  Shall I endeavor\nto describe my own tumultuous, conflicting emotions?  It would be\nuseless, since I know it to be impossible.  For in those dark eyes\nburned a fire I might not see; those silken lashes veiled a message I\ndared not read.\n\nNayland Smith was not blind to the facts of the complicated situation.\nI can truthfully assert that he was the only man of my acquaintance\nwho, having come in contact with Karamaneh, had kept his head.\n\nWe endeavored to divert her mind from the recent tragedies by a round\nof amusements, though with poor Weymouth's body still at the mercy of\nunknown waters Smith and I made but a poor show of gayety; and I took a\ngloomy pride in the admiration which our lovely companion everywhere\nexcited.  I learned, in those days, how rare a thing in nature is a\nreally beautiful woman.\n\nOne afternoon we found ourselves at an exhibition of water colors in\nBond Street.  Karamaneh was intensely interested in the subjects of the\ndrawings--which were entirely Egyptian.  As usual, she furnished matter\nfor comment amongst the other visitors, as did the boy, Aziz, her\nbrother, anew upon the world from his living grave in the house of Dr.\nFu-Manchu.\n\nSuddenly Aziz clutched at his sister's arm, whispering rapidly in\nArabic.  I saw her peachlike color fade; saw her become pale and\nwild-eyed--the haunted Karamaneh of the old days.\n\nShe turned to me.\n\n\"Dr. Petrie--he says that Fu-Manchu is here!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nNayland Smith rapped out the question violently, turning in a flash\nfrom the picture which he was examining.\n\n\"In this room!\" she whispered glancing furtively, affrightedly about\nher.  \"Something tells Aziz when HE is near--and I, too, feel strangely\nafraid.  Oh, can it be that he is not dead!\"\n\nShe held my arm tightly.  Her brother was searching the room with big,\nvelvet black eyes.  I studied the faces of the several visitors; and\nSmith was staring about him with the old alert look, and tugging\nnervously at the lobe of his ear.  The name of the giant foe of the\nwhite race instantaneously had strung him up to a pitch of supreme\nintensity.\n\nOur united scrutinies discovered no figure which could have been that\nof the Chinese doctor.  Who could mistake that long, gaunt shape, with\nthe high, mummy-like shoulders, and the indescribable gait, which I can\nonly liken to that of an awkward cat?\n\nThen, over the heads of a group of people who stood by the doorway, I\nsaw Smith peering at someone--at someone who passed across the outer\nroom.  Stepping aside, I, too, obtained a glimpse of this person.\n\nAs I saw him, he was a tall, old man, wearing a black Inverness coat\nand a rather shabby silk hat.  He had long white hair and a patriarchal\nbeard, wore smoked glasses and walked slowly, leaning upon a stick.\n\nSmith's gaunt face paled.  With a rapid glance at Karamaneh, he made\noff across the room.\n\nCould it be Dr. Fu-Manchu?\n\nMany days had passed since, already half-choked by Inspector Weymouth's\niron grip, Fu-Manchu, before our own eyes, had been swallowed up by the\nThames.  Even now men were seeking his body, and that of his last\nvictim.  Nor had we left any stone unturned.  Acting upon information\nfurnished by Karamaneh, the police had searched every known haunt of\nthe murder group.  But everything pointed to the fact that the group\nwas disbanded and dispersed; that the lord of strange deaths who had\nruled it was no more.\n\nYet Smith was not satisfied.  Neither, let me confess, was I. Every\nport was watched; and in suspected districts a kind of house-to-house\npatrol had been instituted.  Unknown to the great public, in those days\na secret war waged--a war in which all the available forces of the\nauthorities took the field against one man!  But that one man was the\nevil of the East incarnate.\n\nWhen we rejoined him, Nayland Smith was talking to the commissionaire\nat the door.  He turned to me.\n\n\"That is Professor Jenner Monde,\" he said.  \"The sergeant, here, knows\nhim well.\"\n\nThe name of the celebrated Orientalist of course was familiar to me,\nalthough I had never before set eyes upon him.\n\n\"The Professor was out East the last time I was there, sir,\" stated the\ncommissionaire.  \"I often used to see him.  But he's an eccentric old\ngentleman.  Seems to live in a world of his own.  He's recently back\nfrom China, I think.\"\n\nNayland Smith stood clicking his teeth together in irritable\nhesitation.  I heard Karamaneh sigh, and, looking at her, I saw that\nher cheeks were regaining their natural color.\n\nShe smiled in pathetic apology.\n\n\"If he was here he is gone,\" she said.  \"I am not afraid now.\"\n\nSmith thanked the commissionaire for his information and we quitted the\ngallery.\n\n\"Professor Jenner Monde,\" muttered my friend, \"has lived so long in\nChina as almost to be a Chinaman.  I have never met him--never seen\nhim, before; but I wonder--\"\n\n\"You wonder what, Smith?\"\n\n\"I wonder if he could possibly be an ally, of the Doctor's!\"\n\nI stared at him in amazement.\n\n\"If we are to attach any importance to the incident at all,\" I said,\n\"we must remember that the boy's impression--and Karamaneh's--was that\nFu-Manchu was present in person.\"\n\n\"I DO attach importance to the incident, Petrie; they are naturally\nsensitive to such impressions.  But I doubt if even the abnormal\norganization of Aziz could distinguish between the hidden presence of a\ncreature of the Doctor's and that of the Doctor himself.  I shall make\na point of calling upon Professor Jenner Monde.\"\n\nBut Fate had ordained that much should happen ere Smith made his\nproposed call upon the Professor.\n\nKaramaneh and her brother safely lodged in their hotel (which was\nwatched night and day by four men under Smith's orders), we returned to\nmy quiet suburban rooms.\n\n\"First,\" said Smith, \"let us see what we can find out respecting\nProfessor Monde.\"\n\nHe went to the telephone and called up New Scotland Yard.  There\nfollowed some little delay before the requisite information was\nobtained.  Finally, however, we learned that the Professor was\nsomething of a recluse, having few acquaintances, and fewer friends.\n\nHe lived alone in chambers in New Inn Court, Carey Street.  A charwoman\ndid such cleaning as was considered necessary by the Professor, who\nemployed no regular domestic.  When he was in London he might be seen\nfairly frequently at the British Museum, where his shabby figure was\nfamiliar to the officials.  When he was not in London--that is, during\nthe greater part of each year--no one knew where he went.  He never\nleft any address to which letters might be forwarded.\n\n\"How long has he been in London now?\" asked Smith.\n\nSo far as could be ascertained from New Inn Court (replied Scotland\nYard) roughly a week.\n\nMy friend left the telephone and began restlessly to pace the room.\nThe charred briar was produced and stuffed with that broad cut Latakia\nmixture of which Nayland Smith consumed close upon a pound a week.  He\nwas one of those untidy smokers who leave tangled tufts hanging from\nthe pipe-bowl and when they light up strew the floor with smoldering\nfragments.\n\nA ringing came, and shortly afterwards a girl entered.\n\n\"Mr. James Weymouth to see you, sir.\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" rapped Smith.  \"What's this?\"\n\nWeymouth entered, big and florid, and in some respects singularly like\nhis brother, in others as singularly unlike.  Now, in his black suit,\nhe was a somber figure; and in the blue eyes I read a fear suppressed.\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" he began, \"there's something uncanny going on at Maple\nCottage.\"\n\nSmith wheeled the big arm-chair forward.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Weymouth,\" he said.  \"I am not entirely surprised.  But\nyou have my attention.  What has occurred?\"\n\nWeymouth took a cigarette from the box which I proffered and poured out\na peg of whisky.  His hand was not quite steady.\n\n\"That knocking,\" he explained.  \"It came again the night after you were\nthere, and Mrs. Weymouth--my wife, I mean--felt that she couldn't spend\nanother night there, alone.\"\n\n\"Did she look out of the window?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, Doctor; she was afraid.  But I spent last night downstairs in the\nsitting-room--and _I_ looked out!\"\n\nHe took a gulp from his glass.  Nayland Smith, seated on the edge of\nthe table, his extinguished pipe in his hand, was watching him keenly.\n\n\"I'll admit I didn't look out at once,\" Weymouth resumed.  \"There was\nsomething so uncanny, gentlemen, in that knocking--knocking--in the\ndead of the night.  I thought\"--his voice shook--\"of poor Jack, lying\nsomewhere amongst the slime of the river--and, oh, my God!  it came to\nme that it was Jack who was knocking--and I dare not think what\nhe--what it--would look like!\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his chin in his hand.  For a few moments we were all\nsilent.\n\n\"I know I funked,\" he continued huskily.  \"But when the wife came to\nthe head of the stairs and whispered to me:  'There it is again.  What\nin heaven's name can it be'--I started to unbolt the door.  The\nknocking had stopped.  Everything was very still.  I heard Mary--HIS\nwidow--sobbing, upstairs; that was all.  I opened the door, a little\nbit at a time.\"\n\nPausing again, he cleared his throat, and went on:\n\n\"It was a bright night, and there was no one there--not a soul.  But\nsomewhere down the lane, as I looked out into the porch, I heard most\nawful groans!  They got fainter and fainter.  Then--I could have sworn\nI heard SOMEONE LAUGHING!  My nerves cracked up at that; and I shut the\ndoor again.\"\n\nThe narration of his weird experience revived something of the natural\nfear which it had occasioned.  He raised his glass, with unsteady hand,\nand drained it.\n\nSmith struck a match and relighted his pipe.  He began to pace the room\nagain.  His eyes were literally on fire.\n\n\"Would it be possible to get Mrs. Weymouth out of the house before\nto-night?  Remove her to your place, for instance?\" he asked abruptly.\n\nWeymouth looked up in surprise.\n\n\"She seems to be in a very low state,\" he replied.  He glanced at me.\n\"Perhaps Dr. Petrie would give us an opinion?\"\n\n\"I will come and see her,\" I said.  \"But what is your idea, Smith?\"\n\n\"I want to hear that knocking!\" he rapped.  \"But in what I may see fit\nto do I must not be handicapped by the presence of a sick woman.\"\n\n\"Her condition at any rate will admit of our administering an opiate,\"\nI suggested.  \"That would meet the situation?\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Smith.  He was intensely excited now.  \"I rely upon you\nto arrange something, Petrie.  Mr. Weymouth\"--he turned to our\nvisitor--\"I shall be with you this evening not later than twelve\no'clock.\"\n\nWeymouth appeared to be greatly relieved.  I asked him to wait whilst I\nprepared a draught for the patient.  When he was gone:\n\n\"What do you think this knocking means, Smith?\" I asked.\n\nHe tapped out his pipe on the side of the grate and began with nervous\nenergy to refill it again from the dilapidated pouch.\n\n\"I dare not tell you what I hope, Petrie,\" he replied--\"nor what I\nfear.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nDUSK was falling when we made our way in the direction of Maple\nCottage.  Nayland Smith appeared to be keenly interested in the\ncharacter of the district.  A high and ancient wall bordered the road\nalong which we walked for a considerable distance.  Later it gave place\nto a rickety fence.\n\nMy friend peered through a gap in the latter.\n\n\"There is quite an extensive estate here,\" he said, \"not yet cut up by\nthe builder.  It is well wooded on one side, and there appears to be a\npool lower down.\"\n\nThe road was a quiet one, and we plainly heard the tread--quite\nunmistakable--of an approaching policeman.  Smith continued to peer\nthrough the hole in the fence, until the officer drew up level with us.\nThen:\n\n\"Does this piece of ground extend down to the village, constable?\" he\ninquired.\n\nQuite willing for a chat, the man stopped, and stood with his thumbs\nthrust in his belt.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  They tell me three new roads will be made through it\nbetween here and the hill.\"\n\n\"It must be a happy hunting ground for tramps?\"\n\n\"I've seen some suspicious-looking coves about at times.  But after\ndusk an army might be inside there and nobody would ever be the wiser.\"\n\n\"Burglaries frequent in the houses backing on to it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.  A favorite game in these parts is snatching loaves and\nbottles of milk from the doors, first thing, as they're delivered.\nThere's been an extra lot of it lately.  My mate who relieves me has\ngot special instructions to keep his eye open in the mornings!\"  The\nman grinned.  \"It wouldn't be a very big case even if he caught\nanybody!\" \"No,\" said Smith absently; \"perhaps not.  Your business must\nbe a dry one this warm weather.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, sir,\" replied the constable, richer by half-a-crown--\"and\nthank you.\"\n\nSmith stared after him for a moment, tugging reflectively at the lobe\nof his ear.\n\n\"I don't know that it wouldn't be a big case, after all,\" he murmured.\n\"Come on, Petrie.\"\n\nNot another word did he speak, until we stood at the gate of Maple\nCottage.  There a plain-clothes man was standing, evidently awaiting\nSmith.  He touched his hat.\n\n\"Have you found a suitable hiding-place?\" asked my companion rapidly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Kent--my mate--is there now.  You'll\nnotice that he can't be seen from here.\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Smith, peering all about him.  \"He can't. Where is he?\"\n\n\"Behind the broken wall,\" explained the man, pointing.  \"Through that\nivy there's a clear view of the cottage door.\"\n\n\"Good.  Keep your eyes open.  If a messenger comes for me, he is to be\nintercepted, you understand.  No one must be allowed to disturb us.\nYou will recognize the messenger.  He will be one of your fellows.\nShould he come--hoot three times, as much like an owl as you can.\"\n\nWe walked up to the porch of the cottage.  In response to Smith's\nringing came James Weymouth, who seemed greatly relieved by our arrival.\n\n\"First,\" said my friend briskly, \"you had better run up and see the\npatient.\"\n\nAccordingly, I followed Weymouth upstairs and was admitted by his wife\nto a neat little bedroom where the grief-stricken woman lay, a wanly\npathetic sight.\n\n\"Did you administer the draught, as directed?\" I asked.\n\nMrs. James Weymouth nodded.  She was a kindly looking woman, with the\nsame dread haunting her hazel eyes as that which lurked in her\nhusband's blue ones.\n\nThe patient was sleeping soundly.  Some whispered instructions I gave\nto the faithful nurse and descended to the sitting-room. It was a warm\nnight, and Weymouth sat by the open window, smoking.  The dim light\nfrom the lamp on the table lent him an almost startling likeness to his\nbrother; and for a moment I stood at the foot of the stairs scarce able\nto trust my reason.  Then he turned his face fully towards me, and the\nillusion was lost.\n\n\"Do you think she is likely to wake, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think not,\" I replied.\n\nNayland Smith stood upon the rug before the hearth, swinging from one\nfoot to the other, in his nervously restless way.  The room was foggy\nwith the fumes of tobacco, for he, too, was smoking.\n\nAt intervals of some five to ten minutes, his blackened briar (which I\nnever knew him to clean or scrape) would go out.  I think Smith used\nmore matches than any other smoker I have ever met, and he invariably\ncarried three boxes in various pockets of his garments.\n\nThe tobacco habit is infectious, and, seating myself in an arm-chair, I\nlighted a cigarette.  For this dreary vigil I had come prepared with a\nbunch of rough notes, a writing-block, and a fountain pen.  I settled\ndown to work upon my record of the Fu-Manchu case.\n\nSilence fell upon Maple Cottage.  Save for the shuddering sigh which\nwhispered through the over-hanging cedars and Smith's eternal\nmatch-striking, nothing was there to disturb me in my task.  Yet I\ncould make little progress.  Between my mind and the chapter upon which\nI was at work a certain sentence persistently intruded itself.  It was\nas though an unseen hand held the written page closely before my eyes.\nThis was the sentence:\n\n\"Imagine a person, tall, lean, and feline, high-shouldered, with a brow\nlike Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven skull, and long,\nmagnetic eyes of the true cat-green: invest him with all the cruel\ncunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant\nintellect. . .\"\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu!  Fu-Manchu as Smith had described him to me on that\nnight which now seemed so remotely distant--the night upon which I had\nlearned of the existence of the wonderful and evil being born of that\nsecret quickening which stirred in the womb of the yellow races.\n\nAs Smith, for the ninth or tenth time, knocked out his pipe on a bar of\nthe grate, the cuckoo clock in the kitchen proclaimed the hour.\n\n\"Two,\" said James Weymouth.\n\nI abandoned my task, replacing notes and writing-block in the bag that\nI had with me.  Weymouth adjusted the lamp which had begun to smoke.\n\nI tiptoed to the stairs and, stepping softly, ascended to the sick\nroom.  All was quiet, and Mrs. Weymouth whispered to me that the\npatient still slept soundly.  I returned to find Nayland Smith pacing\nabout the room in that state of suppressed excitement habitual with him\nin the approach of any crisis.  At a quarter past two the breeze\ndropped entirely, and such a stillness reigned all about us as I could\nnot have supposed possible so near to the ever-throbbing heart of the\ngreat metropolis.  Plainly I could hear Weymouth's heavy breathing.  He\nsat at the window and looked out into the black shadows under the\ncedars.  Smith ceased his pacing and stood again on the rug very still.\nHe was listening!  I doubt not we were all listening.\n\nSome faint sound broke the impressive stillness, coming from the\ndirection of the village street.  It was a vague, indefinite\ndisturbance, brief, and upon it ensued a silence more marked than ever.\nSome minutes before, Smith had extinguished the lamp.  In the darkness\nI heard his teeth snap sharply together.\n\nThe call of an owl sounded very clearly three times.\n\nI knew that to mean that a messenger had come; but from whence or\nbearing what tidings I knew not.  My friend's plans were\nincomprehensible to me, nor had I pressed him for any explanation of\ntheir nature, knowing him to be in that high-strung and somewhat\nirritable mood which claimed him at times of uncertainty--when he\ndoubted the wisdom of his actions, the accuracy of his surmises.  He\ngave no sign.\n\nVery faintly I heard a clock strike the half-hour. A soft breeze stole\nagain through the branches above.  The wind I thought must be in a new\nquarter since I had not heard the clock before.  In so lonely a spot it\nwas difficult to believe that the bell was that of St. Paul's. Yet such\nwas the fact.\n\nAnd hard upon the ringing followed another sound--a sound we all had\nexpected, had waited for; but at whose coming no one of us, I think,\nretained complete mastery of himself.\n\nBreaking up the silence in a manner that set my heart wildly leaping it\ncame--an imperative knocking on the door!\n\n\"My God!\" groaned Weymouth--but he did not move from his position at\nthe window.\n\n\"Stand by, Petrie!\" said Smith.\n\nHe strode to the door--and threw it widely open.\n\nI know I was very pale.  I think I cried out as I fell back--retreated\nwith clenched hands from before THAT which stood on the threshold.\n\nIt was a wild, unkempt figure, with straggling beard, hideously staring\neyes.  With its hands it clutched at its hair--at its chin; plucked at\nits mouth.  No moonlight touched the features of this unearthly\nvisitant, but scanty as was the illumination we could see the gleaming\nteeth--and the wildly glaring eyes.\n\nIt began to laugh--peal after peal--hideous and shrill.\n\nNothing so terrifying had ever smote upon my ears.  I was palsied by\nthe horror of the sound.\n\nThen Nayland Smith pressed the button of an electric torch which he\ncarried.  He directed the disk of white light fully upon the face in\nthe doorway.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" cried Weymouth.  \"It's John!\"--and again and again: \"Oh,\nGod!  Oh, God!\"\n\nPerhaps for the first time in my life I really believed (nay, I could\nnot doubt) that a thing of another world stood before me.  I am ashamed\nto confess the extent of the horror that came upon me.  James Weymouth\nraised his hands, as if to thrust away from him that awful thing in the\ndoor.  He was babbling--prayers, I think, but wholly incoherent.\n\n\"Hold him, Petrie!\"\n\nSmith's voice was low.  (When we were past thought or intelligent\naction, he, dominant and cool, with that forced calm for which, a\ncrisis over, he always paid so dearly, was thinking of the woman who\nslept above.)\n\nHe leaped forward; and in the instant that he grappled with the one who\nhad knocked I knew the visitant for a man of flesh and blood--a man who\nshrieked and fought like a savage animal, foamed at the mouth and\ngnashed his teeth in horrid frenzy; knew him for a madman--knew him for\nthe victim of Fu-Manchu--not dead, but living--for Inspector\nWeymouth--a maniac!\n\nIn a flash I realized all this and sprang to Smith's assistance.  There\nwas a sound of racing footsteps and the men who had been watching\noutside came running into the porch.  A third was with them; and the\nfive of us (for Weymouth's brother had not yet grasped the fact that a\nman and not a spirit shrieked and howled in our midst) clung to the\ninfuriated madman, yet barely held our own with him.\n\n\"The syringe, Petrie!\" gasped Smith.  \"Quick!  You must manage to make\nan injection!\"\n\nI extricated myself and raced into the cottage for my bag.  A\nhypodermic syringe ready charged I had brought with me at Smith's\nrequest.  Even in that thrilling moment I could find time to admire the\nwonderful foresight of my friend, who had divined what would\nbefall--isolated the strange, pitiful truth from the chaotic\ncircumstances which saw us at Maple Cottage that night.\n\nLet me not enlarge upon the end of the awful struggle.  At one time I\ndespaired (we all despaired) of quieting the poor, demented creature.\nBut at last it was done; and the gaunt, blood-stained savage whom we\nhad known as Detective-Inspector Weymouth lay passive upon the couch in\nhis own sitting-room. A great wonder possessed my mind for the genius\nof the uncanny being who with the scratch of a needle had made a brave\nand kindly man into this unclean, brutish thing.\n\nNayland Smith, gaunt and wild-eyed, and trembling yet with his\ntremendous exertions, turned to the man whom I knew to be the messenger\nfrom Scotland Yard.\n\n\"Well?\" he rapped.\n\n\"He is arrested, sir,\" the detective reported.  \"They have kept him at\nhis chambers as you ordered.\"\n\n\"Has she slept through it?\" said Smith to me.  (I had just returned\nfrom a visit to the room above.) I nodded.\n\n\"Is HE safe for an hour or two?\"--indicating the figure on the couch.\n\"For eight or ten,\" I replied grimly.\n\n\"Come, then.  Our night's labors are not nearly complete.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nLATER was forthcoming evidence to show that poor Weymouth had lived a\nwild life, in hiding among the thick bushes of the tract of land which\nlay between the village and the suburb on the neighboring hill.\nLiterally, he had returned to primitive savagery and some of his food\nhad been that of the lower animals, though he had not scrupled to\nsteal, as we learned when his lair was discovered.\n\nHe had hidden himself cunningly; but witnesses appeared who had seen\nhim, in the dusk, and fled from him.  They never learned that the\nobject of their fear was Inspector John Weymouth.  How, having escaped\ndeath in the Thames, he had crossed London unobserved, we never knew;\nbut his trick of knocking upon his own door at half-past two each\nmorning (a sort of dawning of sanity mysteriously linked with old\ncustom) will be a familiar class of symptom to all students of\nalienation.\n\nI revert to the night when Smith solved the mystery of the knocking.\n\nIn a car which he had in waiting at the end of the village we sped\nthrough the deserted streets to New Inn Court.  I, who had followed\nNayland Smith through the failures and successes of his mission, knew\nthat to-night he had surpassed himself; had justified the confidence\nplaced in him by the highest authorities.\n\nWe were admitted to an untidy room--that of a student, a traveler and a\ncrank--by a plain-clothes officer.  Amid picturesque and disordered\nfragments of a hundred ages, in a great carven chair placed before a\ntowering statue of the Buddha, sat a hand-cuffed man.  His white hair\nand beard were patriarchal; his pose had great dignity.  But his\nexpression was entirely masked by the smoked glasses which he wore.\n\nTwo other detectives were guarding the prisoner.\n\n\"We arrested Professor Jenner Monde as he came in, sir,\" reported the\nman who had opened the door.  \"He has made no statement.  I hope there\nisn't a mistake.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" rapped Smith.\n\nHe strode across the room.  He was consumed by a fever of excitement.\nAlmost savagely, he tore away the beard, tore off the snowy wig dashed\nthe smoked glasses upon the floor.\n\nA great, high brow was revealed, and green, malignant eyes, which fixed\nthemselves upon him with an expression I never can forget.\n\nIT WAS DR. FU-MANCHU!\n\nOne intense moment of silence ensued--of silence which seemed to throb.\nThen:\n\n\"What have you done with Professor Monde?\" demanded Smith.\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu showed his even, yellow teeth in the singularly evil\nsmile which I knew so well.  A manacled prisoner he sat as unruffled as\na judge upon the bench.  In truth and in justice I am compelled to say\nthat Fu-Manchu was absolutely fearless.\n\n\"He has been detained in China,\" he replied, in smooth, sibilant\ntones--\"by affairs of great urgency.  His well-known personality and\nungregarious habits have served me well, here!\"\n\nSmith, I could see, was undetermined how to act; he stood tugging at\nhis ear and glancing from the impassive Chinaman to the wondering\ndetectives.\n\n\"What are we to do, sir?\" one of them asked.\n\n\"Leave Dr. Petrie and myself alone with the prisoner, until I call you.\"\n\nThe three withdrew.  I divined now what was coming.\n\n\"Can you restore Weymouth's sanity?\" rapped Smith abruptly.  \"I cannot\nsave you from the hangman, nor\"--his fists clenched convulsively--\"would\nI if I could; but--\"\n\nFu-Manchu fixed his brilliant eyes upon him.\n\n\"Say no more, Mr. Smith,\" he interrupted; \"you misunderstand me.  I do\nnot quarrel with that, but what I have done from conviction and what I\nhave done of necessity are separated--are seas apart.  The brave\nInspector Weymouth I wounded with a poisoned needle, in self-defense;\nbut I regret his condition as greatly as you do.  I respect such a man.\nThere is an antidote to the poison of the needle.\"\n\n\"Name it,\" said Smith.\n\nFu-Manchu smiled again.\n\n\"Useless,\" he replied.  \"I alone can prepare it.  My secrets shall die\nwith me.  I will make a sane man of Inspector Weymouth, but no one else\nshall be in the house but he and I.\"\n\n\"It will be surrounded by police,\" interrupted Smith grimly.\n\n\"As you please,\" said Fu-Manchu. \"Make your arrangements.  In that\nebony case upon the table are the instruments for the cure.  Arrange\nfor me to visit him where and when you will--\"\n\n\"I distrust you utterly.  It is some trick,\" jerked Smith.\n\nDr. Fu-Manchu rose slowly and drew himself up to his great height.  His\nmanacled hands could not rob him of the uncanny dignity which was his.\nHe raised them above his head with a tragic gesture and fixed his\npiercing gaze upon Nayland Smith.\n\n\"The God of Cathay hear me,\" he said, with a deep, guttural note in his\nvoice--\"I swear--\"\n\n\nThe most awful visitor who ever threatened the peace of England, the\nend of the visit of Fu-Manchu was characteristic--terrible--inexplicable.\n\nStrange to relate, I did not doubt that this weird being had conceived\nsome kind of admiration or respect for the man to whom he had wrought\nso terrible an injury.  He was capable of such sentiments, for he\nentertained some similar one in regard to myself.\n\nA cottage farther down the village street than Weymouth's was vacant,\nand in the early dawn of that morning became the scene of outre\nhappenings.  Poor Weymouth, still in a comatose condition, we removed\nthere (Smith having secured the key from the astonished agent). I\nsuppose so strange a specialist never visited a patient\nbefore--certainly not under such conditions.\n\nFor into the cottage, which had been entirely surrounded by a ring of\npolice, Dr. Fu-Manchu was admitted from the closed car in which, his\nwork of healing complete, he was to be borne to prison--to death!\n\nLaw and justice were suspended by my royally empowered friend that the\nenemy of the white race might heal one of those who had hunted him down!\n\nNo curious audience was present, for sunrise was not yet come; no\nconcourse of excited students followed the hand of the Master; but\nwithin that surrounded cottage was performed one of those miracles of\nscience which in other circumstances had made the fame of Dr. Fu-Manchu\nto live forever.\n\nInspector Weymouth, dazed, disheveled, clutching his head as a man who\nhas passed through the Valley of the Shadow--but sane--sane!--walked\nout into the porch!\n\nHe looked towards us--his eyes wild, but not with the fearsome wildness\nof insanity.\n\n\"Mr. Smith!\" he cried--and staggered down the path--\"Dr. Petrie!\nWhat--\"\n\nThere came a deafening explosion.  From EVERY visible window of the\ndeserted cottage flames burst forth!\n\n\"QUICK!\" Smith's voice rose almost to a scream--\"into the house!\"\n\nHe raced up the path, past Inspector Weymouth, who stood swaying there\nlike a drunken man.  I was close upon his heels.  Behind me came the\npolice.\n\nThe door was impassable!  Already, it vomited a deathly heat, borne\nupon stifling fumes like those of the mouth of the Pit.  We burst a\nwindow.  The room within was a furnace!\n\n\"My God!\" cried someone.  \"This is supernatural!\"\n\n\"Listen!\" cried another.  \"Listen!\"\n\nThe crowd which a fire can conjure up at any hour of day or night, out\nof the void of nowhere, was gathering already.  But upon all descended\na pall of silence.\n\nFrom the heat of the holocaust a voice proclaimed itself--a voice\nraised, not in anguish but in TRIUMPH!  It chanted barbarically--and\nwas still.\n\nThe abnormal flames rose higher--leaping forth from every window.\n\n\"The alarm!\" said Smith hoarsely.  \"Call up the brigade!\"\n\n\nI come to the close of my chronicle, and feel that I betray a\ntrust--the trust of my reader.  For having limned in the colors at my\ncommand the fiendish Chinese doctor, I am unable to conclude my task as\nI should desire, unable, with any consciousness of finality, to write\nFinis to the end of my narrative.\n\nIt seems to me sometimes that my pen is but temporarily idle--that I\nhave but dealt with a single phase of a movement having a hundred\nphases.  One sequel I hope for, and against all the promptings of logic\nand Western bias.  If my hope shall be realized I cannot, at this time,\npretend to state.\n\nThe future, 'mid its many secrets, holds this precious one from me.\n\nI ask you then, to absolve me from the charge of ill completing my\nwork; for any curiosity with which this narrative may leave the reader\nburdened is shared by the writer.\n\nWith intent, I have rushed you from the chambers of Professor Jenner\nMonde to that closing episode at the deserted cottage; I have made the\npace hot in order to impart to these last pages of my account something\nof the breathless scurry which characterized those happenings.\n\nMy canvas may seem sketchy:  it is my impression of the reality.  No\nhard details remain in my mind of the dealings of that night.\nFu-Manchu arrested--Fu-Manchu, manacled, entering the cottage on his\nmission of healing; Weymouth, miraculously rendered sane, coming forth;\nthe place in flames.\n\nAnd then?\n\nTo a shell the cottage burned, with an incredible rapidity which\npointed to some hidden agency; to a shell about ashes which held NO\nTRACE OF HUMAN BONES!\n\nIt has been asked of me:  Was there no possibility of Fu-Manchu's\nhaving eluded us in the ensuing confusion?  Was there no loophole of\nescape?\n\nI reply, that so far as I was able to judge, a rat could scarce have\nquitted the building undetected.  Yet that Fu-Manchu had, in some\nincomprehensible manner and by some mysterious agency, produced those\nabnormal flames, I cannot doubt.  Did he voluntarily ignite his own\nfuneral pyre?\n\nAs I write, there lies before me a soiled and creased sheet of vellum.\nIt bears some lines traced in a cramped, peculiar, and all but\nillegible hand.  This fragment was found by Inspector Weymouth (to this\nday a man mentally sound) in a pocket of his ragged garments.\n\nWhen it was written I leave you to judge.  How it came to be where\nWeymouth found it calls for no explanation:\n\n\n\"To Mr. Commissioner NAYLAND SMITH and Dr. PETRIE--\n\n\"Greeting!  I am recalled home by One who may not be denied.  In much\nthat I came to do I have failed.  Much that I have done I would undo;\nsome little I have undone.  Out of fire I came--the smoldering fire of\na thing one day to be a consuming flame; in fire I go.  Seek not my\nashes.  I am the lord of the fires!  Farewell.\n\n\"FU-MANCHU.\"\n\n\nWho has been with me in my several meetings with the man who penned\nthat message I leave to adjudge if it be the letter of a madman bent\nupon self-destruction by strange means, or the gibe of a\npreternaturally clever scientist and the most elusive being ever born\nof the land of mystery--China.\n\nFor the present, I can aid you no more in the forming of your verdict.\nA day may come though I pray it do not--when I shall be able to throw\nnew light upon much that is dark in this matter.  That day, so far as I\ncan judge, could only dawn in the event of the Chinaman's survival;\ntherefore I pray that the veil be never lifted.\n\nBut, as I have said, there is another sequel to this story which I can\ncontemplate with a different countenance.  How, then, shall I conclude\nthis very unsatisfactory account?\n\nShall I tell you, finally, of my parting with lovely, dark-eyed\nKaramaneh, on board the liner which was to bear her to Egypt?\n\nNo, let me, instead, conclude with the words of Nayland Smith:\n\n\"_I_ sail for Burma in a fortnight, Petrie.  I have leave to break my\njourney at the Ditch.  How would a run up the Nile fit your programme?\nBit early for the season, but you might find something to amuse you!\""
