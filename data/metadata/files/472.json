And yet there are places\nwhere Time seems to linger lovingly long after youth has departed, and\nto which he seems loath to bring the evil day.  Who has not known some\neven-tempered old man or woman who seemed to have drunk of the fountain\nof youth?  Who has not seen somewhere an old town that, having long\nsince ceased to grow, yet held its own without perceptible decline?\n\nSome such trite reflection--as apposite to the subject as most random\nreflections are--passed through the mind of a young man who came out of\nthe front door of the Patesville Hotel about nine o'clock one fine\nmorning in spring, a few years after the Civil War, and started down\nFront Street toward the market-house.  Arriving at the town late the\nprevious evening, he had been driven up from the steamboat in a\ncarriage, from which he had been able to distinguish only the shadowy\noutlines of the houses along the street; so that this morning walk was\nhis first opportunity to see the town by daylight.  He was dressed in a\nsuit of linen duck--the day was warm--a panama straw hat, and patent\nleather shoes.  In appearance he was tall, dark, with straight, black,\nlustrous hair, and very clean-cut, high-bred features.  When he paused\nby the clerk's desk on his way out, to light his cigar, the day clerk,\nwho had just come on duty, glanced at the register and read the last\nentry:--\n\n     \"'JOHN WARWICK, CLARENCE, SOUTH CAROLINA.'\n\n\n\"One of the South Ca'lina bigbugs, I reckon--probably in cotton, or\nturpentine.\"  The gentleman from South Carolina, walking down the\nstreet, glanced about him with an eager look, in which curiosity and\naffection were mingled with a touch of bitterness.  He saw little that\nwas not familiar, or that he had not seen in his dreams a hundred times\nduring the past ten years.  There had been some changes, it is true,\nsome melancholy changes, but scarcely anything by way of addition or\nimprovement to counterbalance them.  Here and there blackened and\ndismantled walls marked the place where handsome buildings once had\nstood, for Sherman's march to the sea had left its mark upon the town.\nThe stores were mostly of brick, two stories high, joining one another\nafter the manner of cities.  Some of the names on the signs were\nfamiliar; others, including a number of Jewish names, were quite\nunknown to him.\n\nA two minutes' walk brought Warwick--the name he had registered under,\nand as we shall call him--to the market-house, the central feature of\nPatesville, from both the commercial and the picturesque points of\nview.  Standing foursquare in the heart of the town, at the\nintersection of the two main streets, a \"jog\" at each street corner\nleft around the market-house a little public square, which at this hour\nwas well occupied by carts and wagons from the country and empty drays\nawaiting hire.  Warwick was unable to perceive much change in the\nmarket-house.  Perhaps the surface of the red brick, long unpainted,\nhad scaled off a little more here and there.  There might have been a\nslight accretion of the moss and lichen on the shingled roof.  But the\ntall tower, with its four-faced clock, rose as majestically and\nuncompromisingly as though the land had never been subjugated. Was it\nso irreconcilable, Warwick wondered, as still to peal out the curfew\nbell, which at nine o'clock at night had clamorously warned all\nnegroes, slave or free, that it was unlawful for them to be abroad\nafter that hour, under penalty of imprisonment or whipping?  Was the\nold constable, whose chief business it had been to ring the bell, still\nalive and exercising the functions of his office, and had age lessened\nor increased the number of times that obliging citizens performed this\nduty for him during his temporary absences in the company of convivial\nspirits?  A few moments later, Warwick saw a colored policeman in the\nold constable's place--a stronger reminder than even the burned\nbuildings that war had left its mark upon the old town, with which Time\nhad dealt so tenderly.\n\nThe lower story of the market-house was open on all four of its sides\nto the public square. Warwick passed through one of the wide brick\narches and traversed the building with a leisurely step. He looked in\nvain into the stalls for the butcher who had sold fresh meat twice a\nweek, on market days, and he felt a genuine thrill of pleasure when he\nrecognized the red bandana turban of old Aunt Lyddy, the ancient negro\nwoman who had sold him gingerbread and fried fish, and told him weird\ntales of witchcraft and conjuration, in the old days when, as an idle\nboy, he had loafed about the market-house.  He did not speak to her,\nhowever, or give her any sign of recognition.  He threw a glance toward\na certain corner where steps led to the town hall above.  On this\nstairway he had once seen a manacled free negro shot while being taken\nupstairs for examination under a criminal charge.  Warwick recalled\nvividly how the shot had rung out.  He could see again the livid look\nof terror on the victim's face, the gathering crowd, the resulting\nconfusion.  The murderer, he recalled, had been tried and sentenced to\nimprisonment for life, but was pardoned by a merciful governor after\nserving a year of his sentence.  As Warwick was neither a prophet nor\nthe son of a prophet, he could not foresee that, thirty years later,\neven this would seem an excessive punishment for so slight a\nmisdemeanor.\n\nLeaving the market-house, Warwick turned to the left, and kept on his\ncourse until he reached the next corner.  After another turn to the\nright, a dozen paces brought him in front of a small weather-beaten\nframe building, from which projected a wooden sign-board bearing the\ninscription:--\n\n  ARCHIBALD STRAIGHT,\n  LAWYER.\n\nHe turned the knob, but the door was locked. Retracing his steps past a\nvacant lot, the young man entered a shop where a colored man was\nemployed in varnishing a coffin, which stood on two trestles in the\nmiddle of the floor.  Not at all impressed by the melancholy\nsuggestiveness of his task, he was whistling a lively air with great\ngusto. Upon Warwick's entrance this effusion came to a sudden end, and\nthe coffin-maker assumed an air of professional gravity.\n\n\"Good-mawnin', suh,\" he said, lifting his cap politely.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" answered Warwick.  \"Can you tell me anything about\nJudge Straight's office hours?\"\n\n\"De ole jedge has be'n a little onreg'lar sence de wah, suh; but he\ngin'ally gits roun' 'bout ten o'clock er so.  He's be'n kin' er feeble\nfer de las' few yeahs.  An' I reckon,\" continued the undertaker\nsolemnly, his glance unconsciously seeking a row of fine caskets\nstanding against the wall,--\"I reckon he'll soon be goin' de way er all\nde earth. 'Man dat is bawn er 'oman hath but a sho't time ter lib, an'\nis full er mis'ry.  He cometh up an' is cut down lack as a flower.'\n'De days er his life is three-sco' an' ten'--an' de ole jedge is libbed\nmo' d'n dat, suh, by five yeahs, ter say de leas'.\"\n\n\"'Death,'\" quoted Warwick, with whose mood the undertaker's remarks\nwere in tune, \"'is the penalty that all must pay for the crime of\nliving.'\"\n\n\"Dat 's a fac', suh, dat 's a fac'; so dey mus'--so dey mus'.  An' den\nall de dead has ter be buried. An' we does ou' sheer of it, suh, we\ndoes ou' sheer. We conduc's de obs'quies er all de bes' w'ite folks er\nde town, suh.\"\n\nWarwick left the undertaker's shop and retraced his steps until he had\npassed the lawyer's office, toward which he threw an affectionate\nglance. A few rods farther led him past the old black Presbyterian\nchurch, with its square tower, embowered in a stately grove; past the\nCatholic church, with its many crosses, and a painted wooden figure of\nSt. James in a recess beneath the gable; and past the old Jefferson\nHouse, once the leading hotel of the town, in front of which political\nmeetings had been held, and political speeches made, and political hard\ncider drunk, in the days of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too.\"\n\nThe street down which Warwick had come intersected Front Street at a\nsharp angle in front of the old hotel, forming a sort of flatiron block\nat the junction, known as Liberty Point,--perhaps because slave\nauctions were sometimes held there in the good old days.  Just before\nWarwick reached Liberty Point, a young woman came down Front Street\nfrom the direction of the market-house. When their paths converged,\nWarwick kept on down Front Street behind her, it having been already\nhis intention to walk in this direction.\n\nWarwick's first glance had revealed the fact that the young woman was\nstrikingly handsome, with a stately beauty seldom encountered.  As he\nwalked along behind her at a measured distance, he could not help\nnoting the details that made up this pleasing impression, for his mind\nwas singularly alive to beauty, in whatever embodiment. The girl's\nfigure, he perceived, was admirably proportioned; she was evidently at\nthe period when the angles of childhood were rounding into the\npromising curves of adolescence.  Her abundant hair, of a dark and\nglossy brown, was neatly plaited and coiled above an ivory column that\nrose straight from a pair of gently sloping shoulders, clearly outlined\nbeneath the light muslin frock that covered them.  He could see that\nshe was tastefully, though not richly, dressed, and that she walked\nwith an elastic step that revealed a light heart and the vigor of\nperfect health.  Her face, of course, he could not analyze, since he\nhad caught only the one brief but convincing glimpse of it.\n\nThe young woman kept on down Front Street, Warwick maintaining his\ndistance a few rods behind her.  They passed a factory, a warehouse or\ntwo, and then, leaving the brick pavement, walked along on mother\nearth, under a leafy arcade of spreading oaks and elms.  Their way led\nnow through a residential portion of the town, which, as they advanced,\ngradually declined from staid respectability to poverty, open and\nunabashed.  Warwick observed, as they passed through the respectable\nquarter, that few people who met the girl greeted her, and that some\nothers whom she passed at gates or doorways gave her no sign of\nrecognition; from which he inferred that she was possibly a visitor in\nthe town and not well acquainted.\n\nTheir walk had continued not more than ten minutes when they crossed a\ncreek by a wooden bridge and came to a row of mean houses standing\nflush with the street.  At the door of one, an old black woman had\nstooped to lift a large basket, piled high with laundered clothes.  The\ngirl, as she passed, seized one end of the basket and helped the old\nwoman to raise it to her head, where it rested solidly on the cushion\nof her head-kerchief. During this interlude, Warwick, though he had\nslackened his pace measurably, had so nearly closed the gap between\nhimself and them as to hear the old woman say, with the dulcet negro\nintonation:--\n\n\"T'anky', honey; de Lawd gwine bless you sho'.  You wuz alluz a good\ngal, and de Lawd love eve'ybody w'at he'p de po' ole nigger.  You gwine\nter hab good luck all yo' bawn days.\"\n\n\"I hope you're a true prophet, Aunt Zilphy,\" laughed the girl in\nresponse.\n\nThe sound of her voice gave Warwick a thrill. It was soft and sweet and\nclear--quite in harmony with her appearance.  That it had a faint\nsuggestiveness of the old woman's accent he hardly noticed, for the\ncurrent Southern speech, including his own, was rarely without a touch\nof it. The corruption of the white people's speech was one\nelement--only one--of the negro's unconscious revenge for his own\ndebasement.\n\nThe houses they passed now grew scattering, and the quarter of the town\nmore neglected. Warwick felt himself wondering where the girl might be\ngoing in a neighborhood so uninviting. When she stopped to pull a\nhalf-naked negro child out of a mudhole and set him upon his feet, he\nthought she might be some young lady from the upper part of the town,\nbound on some errand of mercy, or going, perhaps, to visit an old\nservant or look for a new one.  Once she threw a backward glance at\nWarwick, thus enabling him to catch a second glimpse of a singularly\npretty face.  Perhaps the young woman found his presence in the\nneighborhood as unaccountable as he had deemed hers; for, finding his\nglance fixed upon her, she quickened her pace with an air of startled\ntimidity.\n\n\"A woman with such a figure,\" thought Warwick, \"ought to be able to\nface the world with the confidence of Phryne confronting her judges.\"\n\n\nBy this time Warwick was conscious that something more than mere grace\nor beauty had attracted him with increasing force toward this young\nwoman.  A suggestion, at first faint and elusive, of something\nfamiliar, had grown stronger when he heard her voice, and became more\nand more pronounced with each rod of their advance; and when she\nstopped finally before a gate, and, opening it, went into a yard shut\noff from the street by a row of dwarf cedars, Warwick had already\ndiscounted in some measure the surprise he would have felt at seeing\nher enter there had he not walked down Front Street behind her.  There\nwas still sufficient unexpectedness about the act, however, to give him\na decided thrill of pleasure.\n\n\"It must be Rena,\" he murmured.  \"Who could have dreamed that she would\nblossom out like that?  It must surely be Rena!\"\n\nHe walked slowly past the gate and peered through a narrow gap in the\ncedar hedge.  The girl was moving along a sanded walk, toward a gray,\nunpainted house, with a steep roof, broken by dormer windows.  The\ntrace of timidity he had observed in her had given place to the more\nassured bearing of one who is upon his own ground.  The garden walks\nwere bordered by long rows of jonquils, pinks, and carnations,\ninclosing clumps of fragrant shrubs, lilies, and roses already in\nbloom. Toward the middle of the garden stood two fine magnolia-trees,\nwith heavy, dark green, glistening leaves, while nearer the house two\nmighty elms shaded a wide piazza, at one end of which a honeysuckle\nvine, and at the other a Virginia creeper, running over a wooden\nlattice, furnished additional shade and seclusion.  On dark or wintry\ndays, the aspect of this garden must have been extremely sombre and\ndepressing, and it might well have seemed a fit place to hide some\nguilty or disgraceful secret.  But on the bright morning when Warwick\nstood looking through the cedars, it seemed, with its green frame and\ncanopy and its bright carpet of flowers, an ideal retreat from the\nfierce sunshine and the sultry heat of the approaching summer.\n\nThe girl stooped to pluck a rose, and as she bent over it, her profile\nwas clearly outlined.  She held the flower to her face with a\nlong-drawn inhalation, then went up the steps, crossed the piazza,\nopened the door without knocking, and entered the house with the air of\none thoroughly at home.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man to himself, \"it's Rena, sure enough.\"\n\nThe house stood on a corner, around which the cedar hedge turned,\ncontinuing along the side of the garden until it reached the line of\nthe front of the house.  The piazza to a rear wing, at right angles to\nthe front of the house, was open to inspection from the side street,\nwhich, to judge from its deserted look, seemed to be but little used.\nTurning into this street and walking leisurely past the back yard,\nwhich was only slightly screened from the street by a china-tree,\nWarwick perceived the young woman standing on the piazza, facing an\nelderly woman, who sat in a large rocking-chair, plying a pair of\nknitting-needles on a half-finished stocking.  Warwick's walk led him\nwithin three feet of the side gate, which he felt an almost\nirresistible impulse to enter.  Every detail of the house and garden\nwas familiar; a thousand cords of memory and affection drew him\nthither; but a stronger counter-motive prevailed.  With a great effort\nhe restrained himself, and after a momentary pause, walked slowly on\npast the house, with a backward glance, which he turned away when he\nsaw that it was observed.\n\nWarwick's attention had been so fully absorbed by the house behind the\ncedars and the women there, that he had scarcely noticed, on the other\nside of the neglected by-street, two men working by a large open\nwindow, in a low, rude building with a clapboarded roof, directly\nopposite the back piazza occupied by the two women.  Both the men were\nbusily engaged in shaping barrel-staves, each wielding a sharp-edged\ndrawing-knife on a piece of seasoned oak clasped tightly in a wooden\nvise.\n\n\"I jes' wonder who dat man is, an' w'at he 's doin' on dis street,\"\nobserved the younger of the two, with a suspicious air.  He had noticed\nthe gentleman's involuntary pause and his interest in the opposite\nhouse, and had stopped work for a moment to watch the stranger as he\nwent on down the street.\n\n\"Nev' min' 'bout dat man,\" said the elder one. \"You 'ten' ter yo' wuk\nan' finish dat bairl-stave. You spen's enti'ely too much er yo' time\nstretchin' yo' neck atter other people.  An' you need n' 'sturb yo'se'f\n'bout dem folks 'cross de street, fer dey ain't yo' kin', an' you're\nwastin' yo' time both'in' yo' min' wid 'em, er wid folks w'at comes on\nde street on account of 'em.  Look sha'p now, boy, er you'll git dat\nstave trim' too much.\"\n\nThe younger man resumed his work, but still found time to throw a\nslanting glance out of the window.  The gentleman, he perceived, stood\nfor a moment on the rotting bridge across the old canal, and then\nwalked slowly ahead until he turned to the right into Back Street, a\nfew rods farther on.\n\n\n\nII\n\nAN EVENING VISIT\n\nToward evening of the same day, Warwick took his way down Front Street\nin the gathering dusk. By the time night had spread its mantle over the\nearth, he had reached the gate by which he had seen the girl of his\nmorning walk enter the cedar-bordered garden.  He stopped at the gate\nand glanced toward the house, which seemed dark and silent and deserted.\n\n\"It's more than likely,\" he thought, \"that they are in the kitchen.  I\nreckon I'd better try the back door.\"\n\nBut as he drew cautiously near the corner, he saw a man's figure\noutlined in the yellow light streaming from the open door of a small\nhouse between Front Street and the cooper shop.  Wishing, for reasons\nof his own, to avoid observation, Warwick did not turn the corner, but\nwalked on down Front Street until he reached a point from which he\ncould see, at a long angle, a ray of light proceeding from the kitchen\nwindow of the house behind the cedars.\n\n\"They are there,\" he muttered with a sigh of relief, for he had feared\nthey might be away.  \"I suspect I'll have to go to the front door,\nafter all. No one can see me through the trees.\"\n\nHe retraced his steps to the front gate, which he essayed to open.\nThere was apparently some defect in the latch, for it refused to work.\nWarwick remembered the trick, and with a slight sense of amusement,\npushed his foot under the gate and gave it a hitch to the left, after\nwhich it opened readily enough.  He walked softly up the sanded path,\ntiptoed up the steps and across the piazza, and rapped at the front\ndoor, not too loudly, lest this too might attract the attention of the\nman across the street.  There was no response to his rap.  He put his\near to the door and heard voices within, and the muffled sound of\nfootsteps.  After a moment he rapped again, a little louder than before.\n\nThere was an instant cessation of the sounds within.  He rapped a third\ntime, to satisfy any lingering doubt in the minds of those who he felt\nsure were listening in some trepidation.  A moment later a ray of light\nstreamed through the keyhole.\n\n\"Who's there?\" a woman's voice inquired somewhat sharply.\n\n\"A gentleman,\" answered Warwick, not holding it yet time to reveal\nhimself.  \"Does Mis' Molly Walden live here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the guarded answer.  \"I'm Mis' Walden.  What's yo'r\nbusiness?\"\n\n\"I have a message to you from your son John.\"\n\nA key clicked in the lock.  The door opened, and the elder of the two\nwomen Warwick had seen upon the piazza stood in the doorway, peering\ncuriously and with signs of great excitement into the face of the\nstranger.\n\n\"You 've got a message from my son, you say?\" she asked with tremulous\nagitation.  \"Is he sick, or in trouble?\"\n\n\"No.  He's well and doing well, and sends his love to you, and hopes\nyou've not forgotten him.\"\n\n\"Fergot him?  No, God knows I ain't fergot him!  But come in, sir, an'\ntell me somethin' mo' about him.\"\n\nWarwick went in, and as the woman closed the door after him, he threw a\nglance round the room. On the wall, over the mantelpiece, hung a steel\nengraving of General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans, and, on the\nopposite wall, a framed fashion-plate from \"Godey's Lady's Book.\"  In\nthe middle of the room an octagonal centre-table with a single leg,\nterminating in three sprawling feet, held a collection of curiously\nshaped sea-shells. There was a great haircloth sofa, somewhat the worse\nfor wear, and a well-filled bookcase.  The screen standing before the\nfireplace was covered with Confederate bank-notes of various\ndenominations and designs, in which the heads of Jefferson Davis and\nother Confederate leaders were conspicuous.\n\n     \"Imperious Caesar, dead, and turned to clay,\n       Might stop a hole to keep the wind away,\"\n\nmurmured the young man, as his eye fell upon this specimen of\ndecorative art.\n\nThe woman showed her visitor to a seat.  She then sat down facing him\nand looked at him closely. \"When did you last see my son?\" she asked.\n\n\"I've never met your son,\" he replied.\n\nHer face fell.  \"Then the message comes through you from somebody else?\"\n\n\"No, directly from your son.\"\n\nShe scanned his face with a puzzled look.  This bearded young\ngentleman, who spoke so politely and was dressed so well, surely--no,\nit could not be! and yet--\n\nWarwick was smiling at her through a mist of tears.  An electric spark\nof sympathy flashed between them.  They rose as if moved by one\nimpulse, and were clasped in each other's arms.\n\n\"John, my John!  It IS John!\"\n\n\"Mother--my dear old mother!\"\n\n\"I didn't think,\" she sobbed, \"that I'd ever see you again.\"\n\nHe smoothed her hair and kissed her.  \"And are you glad to see me,\nmother?\"\n\n\"Am I glad to see you?  It's like the dead comin' to life.  I thought\nI'd lost you forever, John, my son, my darlin' boy!\" she answered,\nhugging him strenuously.\n\n\"I couldn't live without seeing you, mother,\" he said.  He meant it,\ntoo, or thought he did, although he had not seen her for ten years.\n\n\"You've grown so tall, John, and are such a fine gentleman!  And you\nARE a gentleman now, John, ain't you--sure enough?  Nobody knows the\nold story?\"\n\n\"Well, mother, I've taken a man's chance in life, and have tried to\nmake the most of it; and I haven't felt under any obligation to spoil\nit by raking up old stories that are best forgotten. There are the dear\nold books: have they been read since I went away?\"\n\n\"No, honey, there's be'n nobody to read 'em, excep' Rena, an' she don't\ntake to books quite like you did.  But I've kep' 'em dusted clean, an'\nkep' the moths an' the bugs out; for I hoped you'd come back some day,\nan' knowed you'd like to find 'em all in their places, jus' like you\nleft 'em.\"\n\n\"That's mighty nice of you, mother.  You could have done no more if you\nhad loved them for themselves.  But where is Rena?  I saw her on the\nstreet to-day, but she didn't know me from Adam; nor did I guess it was\nshe until she opened the gate and came into the yard.\"\n\n\"I've be'n so glad to see you that I'd fergot about her,\" answered the\nmother.  \"Rena, oh, Rena!\"\n\nThe girl was not far away; she had been standing in the next room,\nlistening intently to every word of the conversation, and only kept\nfrom coming in by a certain constraint that made a brother whom she had\nnot met for so many years seem almost as much a stranger as if he had\nnot been connected with her by any tie.\n\n\"Yes, mamma,\" she answered, coming forward.\n\n\"Rena, child, here's yo'r brother John, who's come back to see us.\nTell 'im howdy.\"\n\nAs she came forward, Warwick rose, put his arm around her waist, drew\nher toward him, and kissed her affectionately, to her evident\nembarrassment. She was a tall girl, but he towered above her in quite a\nprotecting fashion; and she thought with a thrill how fine it would be\nto have such a brother as this in the town all the time.  How proud she\nwould be, if she could but walk up the street with such a brother by\nher side!  She could then hold up her head before all the world,\noblivious to the glance of pity or contempt.  She felt a very\npronounced respect for this tall gentleman who held her blushing face\nbetween his hands and looked steadily into her eyes.\n\n\"You're the little sister I used to read stories to, and whom I\npromised to come and see some day.  Do you remember how you cried when\nI went away?\"\n\n\"It seems but yesterday,\" she answered.  \"I've still got the dime you\ngave me.\"\n\nHe kissed her again, and then drew her down beside him on the sofa,\nwhere he sat enthroned between the two loving and excited women.  No\nking could have received more sincere or delighted homage.  He was a\nman, come into a household of women,--a man of whom they were proud,\nand to whom they looked up with fond reverence. For he was not only a\nson,--a brother--but he represented to them the world from which\ncircumstances had shut them out, and to which distance lent even more\nthan its usual enchantment; and they felt nearer to this far-off world\nbecause of the glory which Warwick reflected from it.\n\n\"You're a very pretty girl,\" said Warwick, regarding his sister\nthoughtfully.  \"I followed you down Front Street this morning, and\nscarcely took my eyes off you all the way; and yet I didn't know you,\nand scarcely saw your face. You improve on acquaintance; to-night, I\nfind you handsomer still.\"\n\n\"Now, John,\" said his mother, expostulating mildly, \"you'll spile her,\nif you don't min'.\"\n\nThe girl was beaming with gratified vanity. What woman would not find\nsuch praise sweet from almost any source, and how much more so from\nthis great man, who, from his exalted station in the world, must surely\nknow the things whereof he spoke!  She believed every word of it; she\nknew it very well indeed, but wished to hear it repeated and itemized\nand emphasized.\n\n\"No, he won't, mamma,\" she asserted, \"for he's flattering me.  He talks\nas if I was some rich young lady, who lives on the Hill,\"--the Hill was\nthe aristocratic portion of the town,--\"instead of a poor.\"\n\n\"Instead of a poor young girl, who has the hill to climb,\" replied her\nbrother, smoothing her hair with his hand.  Her hair was long and\nsmooth and glossy, with a wave like the ripple of a summer breeze upon\nthe surface of still water.  It was the girl's great pride, and had\nbeen sedulously cared for.  \"What lovely hair!  It has just the wave\nthat yours lacks, mother.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the regretful reply, \"I've never be'n able to git that wave\nout.  But her hair's be'n took good care of, an' there ain't nary gal\nin town that's got any finer.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the wave, mother.  It's just the fashionable ripple,\nand becomes her immensely.  I think my little Albert favors his Aunt\nRena somewhat.\"\n\n\"Your little Albert!\" they cried.  \"You've got a child?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied calmly, \"a very fine baby boy.\"\n\nThey began to purr in proud contentment at this information, and made\nminute inquiries about the age and weight and eyes and nose and other\nimportant details of this precious infant.  They inquired more coldly\nabout the child's mother, of whom they spoke with greater warmth when\nthey learned that she was dead.  They hung breathless on Warwick's\nwords as he related briefly the story of his life since he had left,\nyears before, the house behind the cedars--how with a stout heart and\nan abounding hope he had gone out into a seemingly hostile world, and\nmade fortune stand and deliver.  His story had for the women the charm\nof an escape from captivity, with all the thrill of a pirate's tale.\nWith the whole world before him, he had remained in the South, the land\nof his fathers, where, he conceived, he had an inalienable birthright.\nBy some good chance he had escaped military service in the Confederate\narmy, and, in default of older and more experienced men, had\nundertaken, during the rebellion, the management of a large estate,\nwhich had been left in the hands of women and slaves.  He had filled\nthe place so acceptably, and employed his leisure to such advantage,\nthat at the close of the war he found himself--he was modest enough to\nthink, too, in default of a better man--the husband of the orphan\ndaughter of the gentleman who had owned the plantation, and who had\nlost his life upon the battlefield.  Warwick's wife was of good family,\nand in a more settled condition of society it would not have been easy\nfor a young man of no visible antecedents to win her hand.  A year or\ntwo later, he had taken the oath of allegiance, and had been admitted\nto the South Carolina bar.  Rich in his wife's right, he had been able\nto practice his profession upon a high plane, without the worry of\nsordid cares, and with marked success for one of his age.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he concluded, \"that I have got along at the bar, as\nelsewhere, owing to the lack of better men.  Many of the good lawyers\nwere killed in the war, and most of the remainder were disqualified;\nwhile I had the advantage of being alive, and of never having been in\narms against the government.  People had to have lawyers, and they gave\nme their business in preference to the carpet-baggers.  Fortune, you\nknow, favors the available man.\"\n\nHis mother drank in with parted lips and glistening eyes the story of\nhis adventures and the record of his successes.  As Rena listened, the\nnarrow walls that hemmed her in seemed to draw closer and closer, as\nthough they must crush her. Her brother watched her keenly.  He had\nbeen talking not only to inform the women, but with a deeper purpose,\nconceived since his morning walk, and deepened as he had followed,\nduring his narrative, the changing expression of Rena's face and noted\nher intense interest in his story, her pride in his successes, and the\noccasional wistful look that indexed her self-pity so completely.\n\n\"An' I s'pose you're happy, John?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"Well, mother, happiness is a relative term, and depends, I imagine,\nupon how nearly we think we get what we think we want.  I have had my\nchance and haven't thrown it away, and I suppose I ought to be happy.\nBut then, I have lost my wife, whom I loved very dearly, and who loved\nme just as much, and I'm troubled about my child.\"\n\n\"Why?\" they demanded.  \"Is there anything the matter with him?\"\n\n\"No, not exactly.  He's well enough, as babies go, and has a good\nenough nurse, as nurses go. But the nurse is ignorant, and not always\ncareful. A child needs some woman of its own blood to love it and look\nafter it intelligently.\"\n\nMis' Molly's eyes were filled with tearful yearning. She would have\ngiven all the world to warm her son's child upon her bosom; but she\nknew this could not be.\n\n\"Did your wife leave any kin?\" she asked with an effort.\n\n\"No near kin; she was an only child.\"\n\n\"You'll be gettin' married again,\" suggested his mother.\n\n\"No,\" he replied; \"I think not.\"\n\nWarwick was still reading his sister's face, and saw the spark of hope\nthat gleamed in her expressive eye.\n\n\"If I had some relation of my own that I could take into the house with\nme,\" he said reflectively, \"the child might be healthier and happier,\nand I should be much more at ease about him.\"\n\nThe mother looked from son to daughter with a dawning apprehension and\na sudden pallor.  When she saw the yearning in Rena's eyes, she threw\nherself at her son's feet.\n\n\"Oh, John,\" she cried despairingly, \"don't take her away from me!\nDon't take her, John, darlin', for it'd break my heart to lose her!\"\n\nRena's arms were round her mother's neck, and Rena's voice was sounding\nin her ears.  \"There, there, mamma!  Never mind!  I won't leave you,\nmamma--dear old mamma!  Your Rena'll stay with you always, and never,\nnever leave you.\"\n\nJohn smoothed his mother's hair with a comforting touch, patted her\nwithered cheek soothingly, lifted her tenderly to her place by his\nside, and put his arm about her.\n\n\"You love your children, mother?\"\n\n\"They're all I've got,\" she sobbed, \"an' they cos' me all I had.  When\nthe las' one's gone, I'll want to go too, for I'll be all alone in the\nworld. Don't take Rena, John; for if you do, I'll never see her again,\nan' I can't bear to think of it.  How would you like to lose yo'r one\nchild?\"\n\n\"Well, well, mother, we'll say no more about it.  And now tell me all\nabout yourself, and about the neighbors, and how you got through the\nwar, and who's dead and who's married--and everything.\"\n\nThe change of subject restored in some degree Mis' Molly's equanimity,\nand with returning calmness came a sense of other responsibilities.\n\n\"Good gracious, Rena!\" she exclaimed. \"John 's be'n in the house an\nhour, and ain't had nothin' to eat yet!  Go in the kitchen an' spread a\nclean tablecloth, an' git out that 'tater pone, an' a pitcher o' that\nlas' kag o' persimmon beer, an' let John take a bite an' a sip.\"\n\nWarwick smiled at the mention of these homely dainties.  \"I thought of\nyour sweet-potato pone at the hotel to-day, when I was at dinner, and\nwondered if you'd have some in the house.  There was never any like\nyours; and I've forgotten the taste of persimmon beer entirely.\"\n\nRena left the room to carry out her hospitable commission.  Warwick,\ntaking advantage of her absence, returned after a while to the former\nsubject.\n\n\"Of course, mother,\" he said calmly, \"I wouldn't think of taking Rena\naway against your wishes.  A mother's claim upon her child is a high\nand holy one.  Of course she will have no chance here, where our story\nis known.  The war has wrought great changes, has put the bottom rail\non top, and all that--but it hasn't wiped THAT out. Nothing but death\ncan remove that stain, if it does not follow us even beyond the grave.\nHere she must forever be--nobody!  With me she might have got out into\nthe world; with her beauty she might have made a good marriage; and, if\nI mistake not, she has sense as well as beauty.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed the mother, \"she's got good sense.  She ain't as quick as\nyou was, an' don't read as many books, but she's keerful an'\npainstakin', an' always tries to do what's right.  She's be'n thinkin'\nabout goin' away somewhere an' tryin' to git a school to teach, er\nsomethin', sence the Yankees have started 'em everywhere for po' white\nfolks an' niggers too.  But I don't like fer her to go too fur.\"\n\n\"With such beauty and brains,\" continued Warwick, \"she could leave this\ntown and make a place for herself.  The place is already made. She has\nonly to step into my carriage--after perhaps a little preparation--and\nride up the hill which I have had to climb so painfully.  It would be a\ngreat pleasure to me to see her at the top. But of course it is\nimpossible--a mere idle dream. YOUR claim comes first; her duty chains\nher here.\"\n\n\"It would be so lonely without her,\" murmured the mother weakly, \"an' I\nlove her so--my las' one!\"\n\n\"No doubt--no doubt,\" returned Warwick, with a sympathetic sigh; \"of\ncourse you love her. It's not to be thought of for a moment.  It's a\npity that she couldn't have a chance here--but how could she!  I had\nthought she might marry a gentleman, but I dare say she'll do as well\nas the rest of her friends--as well as Mary B., for instance, who\nmarried--Homer Pettifoot, did you say?  Or maybe Billy Oxendine might\ndo for her. As long as she has never known any better, she'll probably\nbe as well satisfied as though she married a rich man, and lived in a\nfine house, and kept a carriage and servants, and moved with the best\nin the land.\"\n\nThe tortured mother could endure no more. The one thing she desired\nabove all others was her daughter's happiness.  Her own life had not\nbeen governed by the highest standards, but about her love for her\nbeautiful daughter there was no taint of selfishness.  The life her son\nhad described had been to her always the ideal but unattainable life.\nCircumstances, some beyond her control, and others for which she was\nherself in a measure responsible, had put it forever and inconceivably\nbeyond her reach.  It had been conquered by her son.  It beckoned to\nher daughter.  The comparison of this free and noble life with the\nsordid existence of those around her broke down the last barrier of\nopposition.\n\n\"O Lord!\" she moaned, \"what shall I do with out her?  It'll be lonely,\nJohn--so lonely!\"\n\n\"You'll have your home, mother,\" said Warwick tenderly, accepting the\nimplied surrender. \"You'll have your friends and relatives, and the\nknowledge that your children are happy.  I'll let you hear from us\noften, and no doubt you can see Rena now and then.  But you must let\nher go, mother,--it would be a sin against her to refuse.\"\n\n\"She may go,\" replied the mother brokenly. \"I'll not stand in her\nway--I've got sins enough to answer for already.\"\n\nWarwick watched her pityingly.  He had stirred her feelings to unwonted\ndepths, and his sympathy went out to her.  If she had sinned, she had\nbeen more sinned against than sinning, and it was not his part to judge\nher.  He had yielded to a sentimental weakness in deciding upon this\ntrip to Patesville.  A matter of business had brought him within a\nday's journey of the town, and an over-mastering impulse had compelled\nhim to seek the mother who had given him birth and the old town where\nhe had spent the earlier years of his life. No one would have\nacknowledged sooner than he the folly of this visit.  Men who have\nelected to govern their lives by principles of abstract right and\nreason, which happen, perhaps, to be at variance with what society\nconsiders equally right and reasonable, should, for fear of\ncomplications, be careful about descending from the lofty heights of\nlogic to the common level of impulse and affection. Many years before,\nWarwick, when a lad of eighteen, had shaken the dust of the town from\nhis feet, and with it, he fondly thought, the blight of his\ninheritance, and had achieved elsewhere a worthy career.  But during\nall these years of absence he had cherished a tender feeling for his\nmother, and now again found himself in her house, amid the familiar\nsurroundings of his childhood.  His visit had brought joy to his\nmother's heart, and was now to bring its shrouded companion, sorrow.\nHis mother had lived her life, for good or ill.  A wider door was open\nto his sister--her mother must not bar the entrance.\n\n\"She may go,\" the mother repeated sadly, drying her tears.  \"I'll give\nher up for her good.\"\n\n\"The table 's ready, mamma,\" said Rena, coming to the door.\n\nThe lunch was spread in the kitchen, a large unplastered room at the\nrear, with a wide fireplace at one end.  Only yesterday, it seemed to\nWarwick, he had sprawled upon the hearth, turning sweet potatoes before\nthe fire, or roasting groundpeas in the ashes; or, more often, reading,\nby the light of a blazing pine-knot or lump of resin, some volume from\nthe bookcase in the hall.  From Bulwer's novel, he had read the story\nof Warwick the Kingmaker, and upon leaving home had chosen it for his\nown.  He was a new man, but he had the blood of an old race, and he\nwould select for his own one of its worthy names.  Overhead loomed the\nsame smoky beams, decorated with what might have been, from all\nappearances, the same bunches of dried herbs, the same strings of\nonions and red peppers.  Over in the same corner stood the same\nspinning-wheel, and through the open door of an adjoining room he saw\nthe old loom, where in childhood he had more than once thrown the\nshuttle. The kitchen was different from the stately dining-room of the\nold colonial mansion where he now lived; but it was homelike, and it\nwas familiar. The sight of it moved his heart, and he felt for the\nmoment a sort of a blind anger against the fate which made it necessary\nthat he should visit the home of his childhood, if at all, like a thief\nin the night.  But he realized, after a moment, that the thought was\npure sentiment, and that one who had gained so much ought not to\ncomplain if he must give up a little.  He who would climb the heights\nof life must leave even the pleasantest valleys behind.\n\n\"Rena,\" asked her mother, \"how'd you like to go an' pay yo'r brother\nJohn a visit?  I guess I might spare you for a little while.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes lighted up.  She would not have gone if her mother had\nwished her to stay, but she would always have regarded this as the lost\nopportunity of her life.\n\n\"Are you sure you don't care, mamma?\" she asked, hoping and yet\ndoubting.\n\n\"Oh, I'll manage to git along somehow or other. You can go an' stay\ntill you git homesick, an' then John'll let you come back home.\"\n\nBut Mis' Molly believed that she would never come back, except, like\nher brother, under cover of the night.  She must lose her daughter as\nwell as her son, and this should be the penance for her sin. That her\nchildren must expiate as well the sins of their fathers, who had sinned\nso lightly, after the manner of men, neither she nor they could\nforesee, since they could not read the future.\n\nThe next boat by which Warwick could take his sister away left early in\nthe morning of the next day but one.  He went back to his hotel with\nthe understanding that the morrow should be devoted to getting Rena\nready for her departure, and that Warwick would visit the household\nagain the following evening; for, as has been intimated, there were\nseveral reasons why there should be no open relations between the fine\ngentleman at the hotel and the women in the house behind the cedars,\nwho, while superior in blood and breeding to the people of the\nneighborhood in which they lived, were yet under the shadow of some\ncloud which clearly shut them out from the better society of the town.\nAlmost any resident could have given one or more of these reasons, of\nwhich any one would have been sufficient to most of them; and to some\nof them Warwick's mere presence in the town would have seemed a bold\nand daring thing.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE OLD JUDGE\n\nOn the morning following the visit to his mother, Warwick visited the\nold judge's office. The judge was not in, but the door stood open, and\nWarwick entered to await his return.  There had been fewer changes in\nthe office, where he had spent many, many hours, than in the town\nitself. The dust was a little thicker, the papers in the pigeon-holes\nof the walnut desk were a little yellower, the cobwebs in the corners a\nlittle more aggressive.  The flies droned as drowsily and the murmur of\nthe brook below was just as audible. Warwick stood at the rear window\nand looked out over a familiar view.  Directly across the creek, on the\nlow ground beyond, might be seen the dilapidated stone foundation of\nthe house where once had lived Flora Macdonald, the Jacobite refugee,\nthe most romantic character of North Carolina history.  Old Judge\nStraight had had a tree cut away from the creek-side opposite his\nwindow, so that this historic ruin might be visible from his office;\nfor the judge could trace the ties of blood that connected him\ncollaterally with this famous personage.  His pamphlet on Flora\nMacdonald, printed for private circulation, was highly prized by those\nof his friends who were fortunate enough to obtain a copy.  To the left\nof the window a placid mill-pond spread its wide expanse, and to the\nright the creek disappeared under a canopy of overhanging trees.\n\nA footstep sounded in the doorway, and Warwick, turning, faced the old\njudge.  Time had left greater marks upon the lawyer than upon his\noffice. His hair was whiter, his stoop more pronounced; when he spoke\nto Warwick, his voice had some of the shrillness of old age; and in his\nhand, upon which the veins stood out prominently, a decided tremor was\nperceptible.\n\n\"Good-morning, Judge Straight,\" said the young man, removing his hat\nwith the graceful Southern deference of the young for the old.\n\n\"Good-morning, sir,\" replied the judge with equal courtesy.\n\n\"You don't remember me, I imagine,\" suggested Warwick.\n\n\"Your face seems familiar,\" returned the judge cautiously, \"but I\ncannot for the moment recall your name.  I shall be glad to have you\nrefresh my memory.\"\n\n\"I was John Walden, sir, when you knew me.\"\n\nThe judge's face still gave no answering light of recognition.\n\n\"Your old office-boy,\" continued the younger man.\n\n\"Ah, indeed, so you were!\" rejoined the judge warmly, extending his\nhand with great cordiality, and inspecting Warwick more closely through\nhis spectacles.  \"Let me see--you went away a few years before the war,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, to South Carolina.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I remember now!  I had been thinking it was to the North.\nSo many things have happened since then, that it taxes an old man's\nmemory to keep track of them all.  Well, well! and how have you been\ngetting along?\"\n\nWarwick told his story in outline, much as he had given it to his\nmother and sister, and the judge seemed very much interested.\n\n\"And you married into a good family?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And have children?\"\n\n\"One.\"\n\n\"And you are visiting your mother?\"\n\n\"Not exactly.  I have seen her, but I am stopping at a hotel.\"\n\n\"H'm!  Are you staying long?\"\n\n\"I leave to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It's well enough.  I wouldn't stay too long. The people of a small\ntown are inquisitive about strangers, and some of them have long\nmemories. I remember we went over the law, which was in your favor; but\ncustom is stronger than law--in these matters custom IS law.  It was a\ngreat pity that your father did not make a will.  Well, my boy, I wish\nyou continued good luck; I imagined you would make your way.\"\n\nWarwick went away, and the old judge sat for a moment absorbed in\nreflection.  \"Right and wrong,\" he mused, \"must be eternal verities,\nbut our standards for measuring them vary with our latitude and our\nepoch.  We make our customs lightly; once made, like our sins, they\ngrip us in bands of steel; we become the creatures of our creations.\nBy one standard my old office-boy should never have been born.  Yet he\nis a son of Adam, and came into existence in the way ordained by God\nfrom the beginning of the world. In equity he would seem to be entitled\nto his chance in life; it might have been wiser, though, for him to\nseek it farther afield than South Carolina.  It was too near home, even\nthough the laws were with him.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nDOWN THE RIVER\n\nNeither mother nor daughter slept a great deal during the night of\nWarwick's first visit. Mis' Molly anointed her sacrifice with tears and\ncried herself to sleep.  Rena's emotions were more conflicting; she was\nsorry to leave her mother, but glad to go with her brother.  The mere\njourney she was about to make was a great event for the two women to\ncontemplate, to say nothing of the golden vision that lay beyond, for\nneither of them had ever been out of the town or its vicinity.\n\nThe next day was devoted to preparations for the journey.  Rena's\nslender wardrobe was made ready and packed in a large valise.  Towards\nsunset, Mis' Molly took off her apron, put on her slat-bonnet,--she was\never the pink of neatness,--picked her way across the street, which was\nmuddy from a rain during the day, traversed the foot-bridge that\nspanned the ditch in front of the cooper shop, and spoke first to the\nelder of the two men working there.\n\n\"Good-evenin', Peter.\"\n\n\"Good-evenin', ma'm,\" responded the man briefly, and not relaxing at\nall the energy with which he was trimming a barrel-stave.\n\nMis' Molly then accosted the younger workman, a dark-brown young man,\nsmall in stature, but with a well-shaped head, an expressive forehead,\nand features indicative of kindness, intelligence, humor, and\nimagination.  \"Frank,\" she asked, \"can I git you to do somethin' fer me\nsoon in the mo'nin'?\"\n\n\"Yas 'm, I reckon so,\" replied the young man, resting his hatchet on\nthe chopping-block.  \"W'at is it, Mis' Molly?\"\n\n\"My daughter 's goin' away on the boat, an' I 'lowed you would n' min'\ntotin' her kyarpet-bag down to the w'arf, onless you'd ruther haul it\ndown on yo'r kyart.  It ain't very heavy.  Of co'se I'll pay you fer\nyo'r trouble.\"\n\n\"Thank y', ma'm,\" he replied.  He knew that she would not pay him, for\nthe simple reason that he would not accept pay for such a service.  \"Is\nshe gwine fur?\" he asked, with a sorrowful look, which he could not\nentirely disguise.\n\n\"As fur as Wilmin'ton an' beyon'.  She'll be visitin' her brother John,\nwho lives in--another State, an' wants her to come an' see him.\"\n\n\"Yas 'm, I'll come.  I won' need de kyart--I'll tote de bag.  'Bout\nw'at time shill I come over?\"\n\n\"Well, 'long 'bout seven o'clock or half pas'. She's goin' on the Old\nNorth State, an' it leaves at eight.\"\n\nFrank stood looking after Mis' Molly as she picked her way across the\nstreet, until he was recalled to his duty by a sharp word from his\nfather.\n\n\"'Ten' ter yo' wuk, boy, 'ten' ter yo' wuk.  You 're wastin' yo'\ntime--wastin' yo' time!\"\n\nYes, he was wasting his time.  The beautiful young girl across the\nstreet could never be anything to him.  But he had saved her life once,\nand had dreamed that he might render her again some signal service that\nmight win her friendship, and convince her of his humble devotion.  For\nFrank was not proud.  A smile, which Peter would have regarded as\ncondescending to a free man, who, since the war, was as good as anybody\nelse; a kind word, which Peter would have considered offensively\npatronizing; a piece of Mis' Molly's famous potato pone from Rena's\nhands,--a bone to a dog, Peter called it once;--were ample rewards for\nthe thousand and one small services Frank had rendered the two women\nwho lived in the house behind the cedars.\n\n\nFrank went over in the morning a little ahead of the appointed time,\nand waited on the back piazza until his services were required.\n\n\"You ain't gwine ter be gone long, is you, Miss Rena?\" he inquired,\nwhen Rena came out dressed for the journey in her best frock, with\nbroad white collar and cuffs.\n\nRena did not know.  She had been asking herself the same question.  All\nsorts of vague dreams had floated through her mind during the last few\nhours, as to what the future might bring forth. But she detected the\nanxious note in Frank's voice, and had no wish to give this faithful\nfriend of the family unnecessary pain.\n\n\"Oh, no, Frank, I reckon not.  I'm supposed to be just going on a short\nvisit.  My brother has lost his wife, and wishes me to come and stay\nwith him awhile, and look after his little boy.\"\n\n\"I'm feared you'll lack it better dere, Miss Rena,\" replied Frank\nsorrowfully, dropping his mask of unconcern, \"an' den you won't come\nback, an' none er yo' frien's won't never see you no mo'.\"\n\n\"You don't think, Frank,\" asked Rena severely, \"that I would leave my\nmother and my home and all my friends, and NEVER come back again?\"\n\n\"Why, no 'ndeed,\" interposed Mis' Molly wistfully, as she hovered\naround her daughter, giving her hair or her gown a touch here and\nthere; \"she'll be so homesick in a month that she'll be willin' to walk\nhome.\"\n\n\"You would n' never hafter do dat, Miss Rena,\" returned Frank, with a\ndisconsolate smile.  \"Ef you ever wanter come home, an' can't git back\nno other way, jes' let ME know, an' I'll take my mule an' my kyart an'\nfetch you back, ef it's from de een' er de worl'.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Frank, I believe you would,\" said the girl kindly.  \"You're\na true friend, Frank, and I'll not forget you while I'm gone.\"\n\nThe idea of her beautiful daughter riding home from the end of the\nworld with Frank, in a cart, behind a one-eyed mule, struck Mis' Molly\nas the height of the ridiculous--she was in a state of excitement where\ntears or laughter would have come with equal ease--and she turned away\nto hide her merriment.  Her daughter was going to live in a fine house,\nand marry a rich man, and ride in her carriage.  Of course a negro\nwould drive the carriage, but that was different from riding with one\nin a cart.\n\nWhen it was time to go, Mis' Molly and Rena set out on foot for the\nriver, which was only a short distance away.  Frank followed with the\nvalise.  There was no gathering of friends to see Rena off, as might\nhave been the case under different circumstances.  Her departure had\nsome of the characteristics of a secret flight; it was as important\nthat her destination should not be known, as it had been that her\nbrother should conceal his presence in the town.\n\nMis' Molly and Rena remained on the bank until the steamer announced,\nwith a raucous whistle, its readiness to depart.  Warwick was seen for\na moment on the upper deck, from which he greeted them with a smile and\na slight nod.  He had bidden his mother an affectionate farewell the\nevening before.  Rena gave her hand to Frank.\n\n\"Good-by, Frank,\" she said, with a kind smile; \"I hope you and mamma\nwill be good friends while I'm gone.\"\n\nThe whistle blew a second warning blast, and the deck hands prepared to\ndraw in the gang-plank.  Rena flew into her mother's arms, and then,\nbreaking away, hurried on board and retired to her state-room, from\nwhich she did not emerge during the journey.  The window-blinds were\nclosed, darkening the room, and the stewardess who came to ask if she\nshould bring her some dinner could not see her face distinctly, but\nperceived enough to make her surmise that the young lady had been\nweeping.\n\n\"Po' chile,\" murmured the sympathetic colored woman, \"I reckon some er\nher folks is dead, er her sweetheart 's gone back on her, er e'se she's\nhad some kin' er bad luck er 'nuther.  W'ite folks has deir troubles\njes' ez well ez black folks, an' sometimes feels 'em mo', 'cause dey\nain't ez use' ter 'em.\"\n\nMis' Molly went back in sadness to the lonely house behind the cedars,\nhenceforth to be peopled for her with only the memory of those she had\nloved.  She had paid with her heart's blood another installment on the\nShylock's bond exacted by society for her own happiness of the past and\nher children's prospects for the future.\n\nThe journey down the sluggish river to the seaboard in the\nflat-bottomed, stern-wheel steamer lasted all day and most of the\nnight.  During the first half-day, the boat grounded now and then upon\na sand-bank, and the half-naked negro deck-hands toiled with ropes and\npoles to release it. Several times before Rena fell asleep that night,\nthe steamer would tie up at a landing, and by the light of huge pine\ntorches she watched the boat hands send the yellow turpentine barrels\ndown the steep bank in a long string, or pass cord-wood on board from\nhand to hand.  The excited negroes, their white teeth and eyeballs\nglistening in the surrounding darkness to which their faces formed no\nrelief; the white officers in brown linen, shouting, swearing, and\ngesticulating; the yellow, flickering torchlight over all,--made up a\nscene of which the weird interest would have appealed to a more blase\ntraveler than this girl upon her first journey.\n\nDuring the day, Warwick had taken his meals in the dining-room, with\nthe captain and the other cabin passengers.  It was learned that he was\na South Carolina lawyer, and not a carpet-bagger. Such credentials were\nunimpeachable, and the passengers found him a very agreeable traveling\ncompanion.  Apparently sound on the subject of negroes, Yankees, and\nthe righteousness of the lost cause, he yet discussed these themes in a\nlofty and impersonal manner that gave his words greater weight than if\nhe had seemed warped by a personal grievance.  His attitude, in fact,\npiqued the curiosity of one or two of the passengers.\n\n\"Did your people lose any niggers?\" asked one of them.\n\n\"My father owned a hundred,\" he replied grandly.\n\nTheir respect for his views was doubled.  It is easy to moralize about\nthe misfortunes of others, and to find good in the evil that they\nsuffer;--only a true philosopher could speak thus lightly of his own\nlosses.\n\nWhen the steamer tied up at the wharf at Wilmington, in the early\nmorning, the young lawyer and a veiled lady passenger drove in the same\ncarriage to a hotel.  After they had breakfasted in a private room,\nWarwick explained to his sister the plan he had formed for her future.\nHenceforth she must be known as Miss Warwick, dropping the old name\nwith the old life.  He would place her for a year in a boarding-school\nat Charleston, after which she would take her place as the mistress of\nhis house.  Having imparted this information, he took his sister for a\ndrive through the town.  There for the first time Rena saw great ships,\nwhich, her brother told her, sailed across the mighty ocean to distant\nlands, whose flags he pointed out drooping lazily at the mast-heads.\nThe business portion of the town had \"an ancient and fishlike smell,\"\nand most of the trade seemed to be in cotton and naval stores and\nproducts of the sea.  The wharves were piled high with cotton bales,\nand there were acres of barrels of resin and pitch and tar and spirits\nof turpentine. The market, a long, low, wooden structure, in the middle\nof the principal street, was filled with a mass of people of all\nshades, from blue-black to Saxon blonde, gabbling and gesticulating\nover piles of oysters and clams and freshly caught fish of varied hue.\nBy ten o'clock the sun was beating down so fiercely that the glitter of\nthe white, sandy streets dazzled and pained the eyes unaccustomed to\nit, and Rena was glad to be driven back to the hotel.  The travelers\nleft together on an early afternoon train.\n\nThus for the time being was severed the last tie that bound Rena to her\nnarrow past, and for some time to come the places and the people who\nhad known her once were to know her no more.\n\nSome few weeks later, Mis' Molly called upon old Judge Straight with\nreference to the taxes on her property.\n\n\"Your son came in to see me the other day,\" he remarked.  \"He seems to\nhave got along.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, judge, he's done fine, John has; an' he's took his sister\naway with him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the judge.  Then after a pause he added, \"I hope she\nmay do as well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she said, with a curtsy, as she rose to go.  \"We've\nalways knowed that you were our friend and wished us well.\"\n\nThe judge looked after her as she walked away. Her bearing had a touch\nof timidity, a shade of affectation, and yet a certain pathetic dignity.\n\n\"It is a pity,\" he murmured, with a sigh, \"that men cannot select their\nmothers.  My young friend John has builded, whether wisely or not, very\nwell; but he has come back into the old life and carried away a part of\nit, and I fear that this addition will weaken the structure.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE TOURNAMENT\n\nThe annual tournament of the Clarence Social Club was about to begin.\nThe county fairground, where all was in readiness, sparkled with the\nyouth and beauty of the town, standing here and there under the trees\nin animated groups, or moving toward the seats from which the pageant\nmight be witnessed.  A quarter of a mile of the race track, to right\nand left of the judges' stand, had been laid off for the lists.\nOpposite the grand stand, which occupied a considerable part of this\ndistance, a dozen uprights had been erected at measured intervals.\nProjecting several feet over the track from each of these uprights was\nan iron crossbar, from which an iron hook depended. Between the\nuprights stout posts were planted, of such a height that their tops\ncould be easily reached by a swinging sword-cut from a mounted rider\npassing upon the track.  The influence of Walter Scott was strong upon\nthe old South. The South before the war was essentially feudal, and\nScott's novels of chivalry appealed forcefully to the feudal heart.\nDuring the month preceding the Clarence tournament, the local\nbookseller had closed out his entire stock of \"Ivanhoe,\" consisting of\nfive copies, and had taken orders for seven copies more.  The\ntournament scene in this popular novel furnished the model after which\nthese bloodless imitations of the ancient passages-at-arms were\nconducted, with such variations as were required to adapt them to a\ndifferent age and civilization.\n\nThe best people gradually filled the grand stand, while the poorer\nwhite and colored folks found seats outside, upon what would now be\nknown as the \"bleachers,\" or stood alongside the lists.  The knights,\nmasquerading in fanciful costumes, in which bright-colored garments,\ngilt paper, and cardboard took the place of knightly harness, were\nmounted on spirited horses.  Most of them were gathered at one end of\nthe lists, while others practiced their steeds upon the unoccupied\nportion of the race track.\n\nThe judges entered the grand stand, and one of them, after looking at\nhis watch, gave a signal. Immediately a herald, wearing a bright yellow\nsash, blew a loud blast upon a bugle, and, big with the importance of\nhis office, galloped wildly down the lists.  An attendant on horseback\nbusied himself hanging upon each of the pendent hooks an iron ring, of\nsome two inches in diameter, while another, on foot, placed on top of\neach of the shorter posts a wooden ball some four inches through.\n\n\"It's my first tournament,\" observed a lady near the front of the grand\nstand, leaning over and addressing John Warwick, who was seated in the\nsecond row, in company with a very handsome girl.  \"It is somewhat\ndifferent from Ashby-de-la-Zouch.\"\n\n\"It is the renaissance of chivalry, Mrs. Newberry,\" replied the young\nlawyer, \"and, like any other renaissance, it must adapt itself to new\ntimes and circumstances.  For instance, when we build a Greek portico,\nhaving no Pentelic marble near at hand, we use a pine-tree, one of\nnature's columns, which Grecian art at its best could only copy and\nidealize.  Our knights are not weighted down with heavy armor, but much\nmore appropriately attired, for a day like this, in costumes that\nrecall the picturesqueness, without the discomfort, of the old knightly\nharness.  For an iron-headed lance we use a wooden substitute, with\nwhich we transfix rings instead of hearts; while our trusty blades hew\ntheir way through wooden blocks instead of through flesh and blood.  It\nis a South Carolina renaissance which has points of advantage over the\ntournaments of the olden time.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, Mr. Warwick,\" said the lady, \"that you're the least bit\nheretical about our chivalry--or else you're a little too deep for me.\"\n\n\"The last would be impossible, Mrs. Newberry; and I'm sure our chivalry\nhas proved its valor on many a hard-fought field.  The spirit of a\nthing, after all, is what counts; and what is lacking here?  We have\nthe lists, the knights, the prancing steeds, the trial of strength and\nskill.  If our knights do not run the physical risks of\nAshby-de-la-Zouch, they have all the mental stimulus. Wounded vanity\nwill take the place of wounded limbs, and there will be broken hopes in\nlieu of broken heads.  How many hearts in yonder group of gallant\nhorsemen beat high with hope!  How many possible Queens of Love and\nBeauty are in this group of fair faces that surround us!\"\n\nThe lady was about to reply, when the bugle sounded again, and the\nherald dashed swiftly back upon his prancing steed to the waiting group\nof riders.  The horsemen formed three abreast, and rode down the lists\nin orderly array.  As they passed the grand stand, each was conscious\nof the battery of bright eyes turned upon him, and each gave by his\nbearing some idea of his ability to stand fire from such weapons.  One\nhorse pranced proudly, another caracoled with grace.  One rider\nfidgeted nervously, another trembled and looked the other way.  Each\nhorseman carried in his hand a long wooden lance and wore at his side a\ncavalry sabre, of which there were plenty to be had since the war, at\nsmall expense.  Several left the ranks and drew up momentarily beside\nthe grand stand, where they took from fair hands a glove or a flower,\nwhich was pinned upon the rider's breast or fastened upon his hat--a\nribbon or a veil, which was tied about the lance like a pennon, but far\nenough from the point not to interfere with the usefulness of the\nweapon.\n\nAs the troop passed the lower end of the grand stand, a horse, excited\nby the crowd, became somewhat unmanageable, and in the effort to curb\nhim, the rider dropped his lance.  The prancing animal reared, brought\none of his hoofs down upon the fallen lance with considerable force,\nand sent a broken piece of it flying over the railing opposite the\ngrand stand, into the middle of a group of spectators standing there.\nThe flying fragment was dodged by those who saw it coming, but brought\nup with a resounding thwack against the head of a colored man in the\nsecond row, who stood watching the grand stand with an eager and\ncurious gaze.  He rubbed his head ruefully, and made a good-natured\nresponse to the chaffing of his neighbors, who, seeing no great harm\ndone, made witty and original remarks about the advantage of being\nblack upon occasions where one's skull was exposed to danger.  Finding\nthat the blow had drawn blood, the young man took out a red bandana\nhandkerchief and tied it around his head, meantime letting his eye roam\nover the faces in the grand stand, as though in search of some one that\nhe expected or hoped to find there.\n\nThe knights, having reached the end of the lists, now turned and rode\nback in open order, with such skillful horsemanship as to evoke a storm\nof applause from the spectators.  The ladies in the grand stand waved\ntheir handkerchiefs vigorously, and the men clapped their hands.  The\nbeautiful girl seated by Warwick's side accidentally let a little\nsquare of white lace-trimmed linen slip from her hand.  It fluttered\nlightly over the railing, and, buoyed up by the air, settled slowly\ntoward the lists.  A young rider in the approaching rear rank saw the\nhandkerchief fall, and darting swiftly forward, caught it on the point\nof his lance ere it touched the ground.  He drew up his horse and made\na movement as though to extend the handkerchief toward the lady, who\nwas blushing profusely at the attention she had attracted by her\ncarelessness.  The rider hesitated a moment, glanced interrogatively at\nWarwick, and receiving a smile in return, tied the handkerchief around\nthe middle of his lance and quickly rejoined his comrades at the head\nof the lists.\n\nThe young man with the bandage round his head, on the benches across\nthe lists, had forced his way to the front row and was leaning against\nthe railing.  His restless eye was attracted by the falling\nhandkerchief, and his face, hitherto anxious, suddenly lit up with\nanimation.\n\n\"Yas, suh, yas, suh, it's her!\" he muttered softly.  \"It's Miss Rena,\nsho's you bawn.  She looked lack a' angel befo', but now, up dere\n'mongs' all dem rich, fine folks, she looks lack a whole flock er\nangels.  Dey ain' one er dem ladies w'at could hol' a candle ter her.\nI wonder w'at dat man's gwine ter do wid her handkercher?  I s'pose\nhe's her gent'eman now.  I wonder ef she'd know me er speak ter me ef\nshe seed me? I reckon she would, spite er her gittin' up so in de\nworl'; fer she wuz alluz good ter ev'ybody, an' dat let even ME in,\" he\nconcluded with a sigh.\n\n\"Who is the lady, Tryon?\" asked one of the young men, addressing the\nknight who had taken the handkerchief.\n\n\"A Miss Warwick,\" replied the knight pleasantly, \"Miss Rowena Warwick,\nthe lawyer's sister.\"\n\n\"I didn't know he had a sister,\" rejoined the first speaker.  \"I envy\nyou your lady.  There are six Rebeccas and eight Rowenas of my own\nacquaintance in the grand stand, but she throws them all into the\nshade.  She hasn't been here long, surely; I haven't seen her before.\"\n\n\"She has been away at school; she came only last night,\" returned the\nknight of the crimson sash, briefly.  He was already beginning to feel\na proprietary interest in the lady whose token he wore, and did not\ncare to discuss her with a casual acquaintance.\n\nThe herald sounded the charge.  A rider darted out from the group and\ngalloped over the course. As he passed under each ring, he tried to\ncatch it on the point of his lance,--a feat which made the management\nof the horse with the left hand necessary, and required a true eye and\na steady arm.  The rider captured three of the twelve rings, knocked\nthree others off the hooks, and left six undisturbed.  Turning at the\nend of the lists, he took the lance with the reins in the left hand and\ndrew his sword with the right.  He then rode back over the course,\ncutting at the wooden balls upon the posts.  Of these he clove one in\ntwain, to use the parlance of chivalry, and knocked two others off\ntheir supports.  His performance was greeted with a liberal measure of\napplause, for which he bowed in smiling acknowledgment as he took his\nplace among the riders.\n\nAgain the herald's call sounded, and the tourney went forward.  Rider\nafter rider, with varying skill, essayed his fortune with lance and\nsword. Some took a liberal proportion of the rings; others merely\nknocked them over the boundaries, where they were collected by agile\nlittle negro boys and handed back to the attendants.  A balking horse\ncaused the spectators much amusement and his rider no little chagrin.\n\nThe lady who had dropped the handkerchief kept her eye upon the knight\nwho had bound it round his lance.  \"Who is he, John?\" she asked the\ngentleman beside her.\n\n\"That, my dear Rowena, is my good friend and client, George Tryon, of\nNorth Carolina.  If he had been a stranger, I should have said that he\ntook a liberty; but as things stand, we ought to regard it as a\ncompliment.  The incident is quite in accord with the customs of\nchivalry.  If George were but masked and you were veiled, we should\nhave a romantic situation,--you the mysterious damsel in distress, he\nthe unknown champion.  The parallel, my dear, might not be so hard to\ndraw, even as things are.  But look, it is his turn now; I'll wager\nthat he makes a good run.\"\n\n\"I'll take you up on that, Mr. Warwick,\" said Mrs. Newberry from\nbehind, who seemed to have a very keen ear for whatever Warwick said.\n\nRena's eyes were fastened on her knight, so that she might lose no\nsingle one of his movements.  As he rode down the lists, more than one\nwoman found him pleasant to look upon.  He was a tall, fair young man,\nwith gray eyes, and a frank, open face. He wore a slight mustache, and\nwhen he smiled, showed a set of white and even teeth.  He was mounted\non a very handsome and spirited bay mare, was clad in a picturesque\ncostume, of which velvet knee-breeches and a crimson scarf were the\nmost conspicuous features, and displayed a marked skill in\nhorsemanship.  At the blast of the bugle his horse started forward,\nand, after the first few rods, settled into an even gallop.  Tryon's\nlance, held truly and at the right angle, captured the first ring, then\nthe second and third.  His coolness and steadiness seemed not at all\ndisturbed by the applause which followed, and one by one the remaining\nrings slipped over the point of his lance, until at the end he had\ntaken every one of the twelve.  Holding the lance with its booty of\ncaptured rings in his left hand, together with the bridle rein, he drew\nhis sabre with the right and rode back over the course. His horse moved\nlike clockwork, his eye was true and his hand steady.  Three of the\nwooden balls fell from the posts, split fairly in the middle, while\nfrom the fourth he sliced off a goodly piece and left the remainder\nstanding in its place.\n\nThis performance, by far the best up to this point, and barely escaping\nperfection, elicited a storm of applause.  The rider was not so well\nknown to the townspeople as some of the other participants, and his\nname passed from mouth to mouth in answer to numerous inquiries.  The\ngirl whose token he had worn also became an object of renewed interest,\nbecause of the result to her in case the knight should prove victor in\nthe contest, of which there could now scarcely be a doubt; for but\nthree riders remained, and it was very improbable that any one of them\nwould excel the last. Wagers for the remainder of the tourney stood\nanywhere from five, and even from ten to one, in favor of the knight of\nthe crimson sash, and when the last course had been run, his backers\nwere jubilant.  No one of those following him had displayed anything\nlike equal skill.\n\nThe herald now blew his bugle and declared the tournament closed.  The\njudges put their heads together for a moment.  The bugle sounded again,\nand the herald announced in a loud voice that Sir George Tryon, having\ntaken the greatest number of rings and split the largest number of\nballs, was proclaimed victor in the tournament and entitled to the\nflowery chaplet of victory.\n\nTryon, having bowed repeatedly in response to the liberal applause,\nadvanced to the judges' stand and received the trophy from the hands of\nthe chief judge, who exhorted him to wear the garland worthily, and to\nyield it only to a better man.\n\n\"It will be your privilege, Sir George,\" announced the judge, \"as the\nchief reward of your valor, to select from the assembled beauty of\nClarence the lady whom you wish to honor, to whom we will all do homage\nas the Queen of Love and Beauty.\"\n\nTryon took the wreath and bowed his thanks. Then placing the trophy on\nthe point of his lance, he spoke earnestly for a moment to the herald,\nand rode past the grand stand, from which there was another outburst of\napplause.  Returning upon his tracks, the knight of the crimson sash\npaused before the group where Warwick and his sister sat, and lowered\nthe wreath thrice before the lady whose token he had won.\n\n\"Oyez! Oyez!\" cried the herald; \"Sir George Tryon, the victor in the\ntournament, has chosen Miss Rowena Warwick as the Queen of Love and\nBeauty, and she will be crowned at the feast to-night and receive the\ndevoirs of all true knights.\"\n\nThe fair-ground was soon covered with scattered groups of the\nspectators of the tournament.  In one group a vanquished knight\nexplained in elaborate detail why it was that he had failed to win the\nwreath.  More than one young woman wondered why some one of the home\nyoung men could not have taken the honors, or, if the stranger must win\nthem, why he could not have selected some belle of the town as Queen of\nLove and Beauty instead of this upstart girl who had blown into the\ntown over night, as one might say.\n\nWarwick and his sister, standing under a spreading elm, held a little\ncourt of their own.  A dozen gentlemen and several ladies had sought an\nintroduction before Tryon came up.\n\n\"I suppose John would have a right to call me out, Miss Warwick,\" said\nTryon, when he had been formally introduced and had shaken hands with\nWarwick's sister, \"for taking liberties with the property and name of a\nlady to whom I had not had an introduction; but I know John so well\nthat you seemed like an old acquaintance; and when I saw you, and\nrecalled your name, which your brother had mentioned more than once, I\nfelt instinctively that you ought to be the queen.  I entered my name\nonly yesterday, merely to swell the number and make the occasion more\ninteresting. These fellows have been practicing for a month, and I had\nno hope of winning.  I should have been satisfied, indeed, if I hadn't\nmade myself ridiculous; but when you dropped your handkerchief, I felt\na sudden inspiration; and as soon as I had tied it upon my lance,\nvictory perched upon my saddle-bow, guided my lance and sword, and\nrings and balls went down before me like chaff before the wind.  Oh, it\nwas a great inspiration, Miss Warwick!\"\n\nRena, for it was our Patesville acquaintance fresh from\nboarding-school, colored deeply at this frank and fervid flattery, and\ncould only murmur an inarticulate reply.  Her year of instruction,\nwhile distinctly improving her mind and manners, had scarcely prepared\nher for so sudden an elevation into a grade of society to which she had\nhitherto been a stranger.  She was not without a certain courage,\nhowever, and her brother, who remained at her side, helped her over the\nmost difficult situations.\n\n\"We'll forgive you, George,\" replied Warwick, \"if you'll come home to\nluncheon with us.\"\n\n\"I'm mighty sorry--awfully sorry,\" returned Tryon, with evident regret,\n\"but I have another engagement, which I can scarcely break, even by the\ncommand of royalty.  At what time shall I call for Miss Warwick this\nevening?  I believe that privilege is mine, along with the other honors\nand rewards of victory,--unless she is bound to some one else.\"\n\n\"She is entirely free,\" replied Warwick.  \"Come as early as you like,\nand I'll talk to you until she's ready.\"\n\nTryon bowed himself away, and after a number of gentlemen and a few\nladies had paid their respects to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and\nreceived an introduction to her, Warwick signaled to the servant who\nhad his carriage in charge, and was soon driving homeward with his\nsister.  No one of the party noticed a young negro, with a handkerchief\nbound around his head, who followed them until the carriage turned into\nthe gate and swept up the wide drive that led to Warwick's doorstep.\n\n\"Well, Rena,\" said Warwick, when they found themselves alone, \"you have\narrived.  Your debut into society is a little more spectacular than I\nshould have wished, but we must rise to the occasion and make the most\nof it.  You are winning the first fruits of your opportunity.  You are\nthe most envied woman in Clarence at this particular moment, and,\nunless I am mistaken, will be the most admired at the ball to-night.\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE QUEEN OF LOVE AND BEAUTY\n\nShortly after luncheon, Rena had a visitor in the person of Mrs.\nNewberry, a vivacious young widow of the town, who proffered her\nservices to instruct Rena in the etiquette of the annual ball.\n\n\"Now, my dear,\" said Mrs. Newberry, \"the first thing to do is to get\nyour coronation robe ready.  It simply means a gown with a long train.\nYou have a lovely white waist.  Get right into my buggy, and we'll go\ndown town to get the cloth, take it over to Mrs. Marshall's, and have\nher run you up a skirt this afternoon.\"\n\nRena placed herself unreservedly in the hands of Mrs. Newberry, who\nintroduced her to the best dressmaker of the town, a woman of much\nexperience in such affairs, who improvised during the afternoon a gown\nsuited to the occasion.  Mrs. Marshall had made more than a dozen ball\ndresses during the preceding month; being a wise woman and\nunderstanding her business thoroughly, she had made each one of them so\nthat with a few additional touches it might serve for the Queen of Love\nand Beauty.  This was her first direct order for the specific garment.\n\nTryon escorted Rena to the ball, which was held in the principal public\nhall of the town, and attended by all the best people.  The champion\nstill wore the costume of the morning, in place of evening dress, save\nthat long stockings and dancing-pumps had taken the place of\nriding-boots. Rena went through the ordeal very creditably. Her shyness\nwas palpable, but it was saved from awkwardness by her native grace and\ngood sense. She made up in modesty what she lacked in aplomb.  Her\nmonths in school had not eradicated a certain self-consciousness born\nof her secret. The brain-cells never lose the impressions of youth, and\nRena's Patesville life was not far enough removed to have lost its\ndistinctness of outline. Of the two, the present was more of a dream,\nthe past was the more vivid reality.  At school she had learned\nsomething from books and not a little from observation.  She had been\nable to compare herself with other girls, and to see wherein she\nexcelled or fell short of them.  With a sincere desire for improvement,\nand a wish to please her brother and do him credit, she had sought to\nmake the most of her opportunities.  Building upon a foundation of\ninnate taste and intelligence, she had acquired much of the\nself-possession which comes from a knowledge of correct standards of\ndeportment. She had moreover learned without difficulty, for it suited\nher disposition, to keep silence when she could not speak to advantage.\nA certain necessary reticence about the past added strength to a\nnatural reserve.  Thus equipped, she held her own very well in the\nsomewhat trying ordeal of the ball, at which the fiction of queenship\nand the attendant ceremonies, which were pretty and graceful, made her\nthe most conspicuous figure.  Few of those who watched her move with\neasy grace through the measures of the dance could have guessed how\nnearly her heart was in her mouth during much of the time.\n\n\"You're doing splendidly, my dear,\" said Mrs. Newberry, who had\nconstituted herself Rena's chaperone.\n\n\"I trust your Gracious Majesty is pleased with the homage of your\ndevoted subjects,\" said Tryon, who spent much of his time by her side\nand kept up the character of knight in his speech and manner.\n\n\"Very much,\" replied the Queen of Love and Beauty, with a somewhat\ntired smile.  It was pleasant, but she would be glad, she thought, when\nit was all over.\n\n\"Keep up your courage,\" whispered her brother. \"You are not only queen,\nbut the belle of the ball.  I am proud of you.  A dozen women here\nwould give a year off the latter end of life to be in your shoes\nto-night.\"\n\nRena felt immensely relieved when the hour arrived at which she could\ntake her departure, which was to be the signal for the breaking-up of\nthe ball.  She was driven home in Tryon's carriage, her brother\naccompanying them.  The night was warm, and the drive homeward under\nthe starlight, in the open carriage, had a soothing effect upon Rena's\nexcited nerves.  The calm restfulness of the night, the cool blue\ndepths of the unclouded sky, the solemn croaking of the frogs in a\ndistant swamp, were much more in harmony with her nature than the\ncrowded brilliancy of the ball-room. She closed her eyes, and, leaning\nback in the carriage, thought of her mother, who she wished might have\nseen her daughter this night.  A momentary pang of homesickness pierced\nher tender heart, and she furtively wiped away the tears that came into\nher eyes.\n\n\"Good-night, fair Queen!\" exclaimed Tryon, breaking into her reverie as\nthe carriage rolled up to the doorstep, \"and let your loyal subject\nkiss your hand in token of his fealty.  May your Majesty never abdicate\nher throne, and may she ever count me her humble servant and devoted\nknight.\"\n\n\"And now, sister,\" said Warwick, when Tryon had been driven away, \"now\nthat the masquerade is over, let us to sleep, and to-morrow take up the\nserious business of life.  Your day has been a glorious success!\"\n\nHe put his arm around her and gave her a kiss and a brotherly hug.\n\n\"It is a dream,\" she murmured sleepily, \"only a dream.  I am Cinderella\nbefore the clock has struck.  Good-night, dear John.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Rowena.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\n'MID NEW SURROUNDINGS\n\nWarwick's residence was situated in the outskirts of the town.  It was\na fine old plantation house, built in colonial times, with a stately\ncolonnade, wide verandas, and long windows with Venetian blinds.  It\nwas painted white, and stood back several rods from the street, in a\ncharming setting of palmettoes, magnolias, and flowering shrubs.  Rena\nhad always thought her mother's house large, but now it seemed cramped\nand narrow, in comparison with this roomy mansion.  The furniture was\nold-fashioned and massive.  The great brass andirons on the wide hearth\nstood like sentinels proclaiming and guarding the dignity of the\nfamily.  The spreading antlers on the wall testified to a mighty hunter\nin some past generation. The portraits of Warwick's wife's\nancestors--high featured, proud men and women, dressed in the fashions\nof a bygone age--looked down from tarnished gilt frames.  It was all\nvery novel to her, and very impressive.  When she ate off china, with\nsilver knives and forks that had come down as heirlooms, escaping\nsomehow the ravages and exigencies of the war time,--Warwick told her\nafterwards how he had buried them out of reach of friend or foe,--she\nthought that her brother must be wealthy, and she felt very proud of\nhim and of her opportunity.  The servants, of whom there were several\nin the house, treated her with a deference to which her eight months in\nschool had only partly accustomed her.  At school she had been one of\nmany to be served, and had herself been held to obedience.  Here, for\nthe first time in her life, she was mistress, and tasted the sweets of\npower.\n\nThe household consisted of her brother and herself, a cook, a coachman,\na nurse, and her brother's little son Albert.  The child, with a fine\ninstinct, had put out his puny arms to Rena at first sight, and she had\nclasped the little man to her bosom with a motherly caress.  She had\nalways loved weak creatures.  Kittens and puppies had ever found a\nwelcome and a meal at Rena's hands, only to be chased away by Mis'\nMolly, who had had a wider experience.  No shiftless poor white, no\nhalf-witted or hungry negro, had ever gone unfed from Mis' Molly's\nkitchen door if Rena were there to hear his plaint.  Little Albert was\npale and sickly when she came, but soon bloomed again in the sunshine\nof her care, and was happy only in her presence.  Warwick found\npleasure in their growing love for each other, and was glad to perceive\nthat the child formed a living link to connect her with his home.\n\n\"Dat chile sutt'nly do lub Miss Rena, an' dat's a fac', sho 's you\nbawn,\" remarked 'Lissa the cook to Mimy the nurse one day.  \"You'll get\nyo' nose put out er j'int, ef you don't min'.\"\n\n\"I ain't frettin', honey,\" laughed the nurse good-naturedly.  She was\nnot at all jealous.  She had the same wages as before, and her labors\nwere materially lightened by the aunt's attention to the child.  This\ngave Mimy much more time to flirt with Tom the coachman.\n\nIt was a source of much gratification to Warwick that his sister seemed\nto adapt herself so easily to the new conditions.  Her graceful\nmovements, the quiet elegance with which she wore even the simplest\ngown, the easy authoritativeness with which she directed the servants,\nwere to him proofs of superior quality, and he felt correspondingly\nproud of her.  His feeling for her was something more than brotherly\nlove,--he was quite conscious that there were degrees in brotherly\nlove, and that if she had been homely or stupid, he would never have\ndisturbed her in the stagnant life of the house behind the cedars.\nThere had come to him from some source, down the stream of time, a rill\nof the Greek sense of proportion, of fitness, of beauty, which is\nindeed but proportion embodied, the perfect adaptation of means to\nends.  He had perceived, more clearly than she could have appreciated\nit at that time, the undeveloped elements of discord between Rena and\nher former life.  He had imagined her lending grace and charm to his\nown household.  Still another motive, a purely psychological one, had\nmore or less consciously influenced him.  He had no fear that the\nfamily secret would ever be discovered,--he had taken his precautions\ntoo thoroughly, he thought, for that; and yet he could not but feel, at\ntimes, that if peradventure--it was a conceivable hypothesis--it should\nbecome known, his fine social position would collapse like a house of\ncards.  Because of this knowledge, which the world around him did not\npossess, he had felt now and then a certain sense of loneliness; and\nthere was a measure of relief in having about him one who knew his\npast, and yet whose knowledge, because of their common interest, would\nnot interfere with his present or jeopardize his future. For he had\nalways been, in a figurative sense, a naturalized foreigner in the\nworld of wide opportunity, and Rena was one of his old compatriots,\nwhom he was glad to welcome into the populous loneliness of his adopted\ncountry.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE COURTSHIP\n\nIn a few weeks the echoes of the tournament died away, and Rena's life\nsettled down into a pleasant routine, which she found much more\ncomfortable than her recent spectacular prominence. Her queenship,\nwhile not entirely forgiven by the ladies of the town, had gained for\nher a temporary social prominence.  Among her own sex, Mrs. Newberry\nproved a warm and enthusiastic friend.  Rumor whispered that the lively\nyoung widow would not be unwilling to console Warwick in the loneliness\nof the old colonial mansion, to which his sister was a most excellent\nmedium of approach.  Whether this was true or not it is unnecessary to\ninquire, for it is no part of this story, except as perhaps indicating\nwhy Mrs. Newberry played the part of the female friend, without whom no\nwoman is ever launched successfully in a small and conservative\nsociety.  Her brother's standing gave her the right of social entry;\nthe tournament opened wide the door, and Mrs. Newberry performed the\nceremony of introduction.  Rena had many visitors during the month\nfollowing the tournament, and might have made her choice from among a\ndozen suitors; but among them all, her knight of the handkerchief found\nmost favor.\n\n\nGeorge Tryon had come to Clarence a few months before upon business\nconnected with the settlement of his grandfather's estate.  A rather\ncomplicated litigation had grown up around the affair, various phases\nof which had kept Tryon almost constantly in the town.  He had placed\nmatters in Warwick's hands, and had formed a decided friendship for his\nattorney, for whom he felt a frank admiration.  Tryon was only\ntwenty-three, and his friend's additional five years, supplemented by a\ncertain professional gravity, commanded a great deal of respect from\nthe younger man.  When Tryon had known Warwick for a week, he had been\nready to swear by him.  Indeed, Warwick was a man for whom most people\nformed a liking at first sight.  To this power of attraction he owed\nmost of his success--first with Judge Straight, of Patesville, then\nwith the lawyer whose office he had entered at Clarence, with the woman\nwho became his wife, and with the clients for whom he transacted\nbusiness.  Tryon would have maintained against all comers that Warwick\nwas the finest fellow in the world.  When he met Warwick's sister, the\nfoundation for admiration had already been laid.  If Rena had proved to\nbe a maiden lady of uncertain age and doubtful personal attractiveness,\nTryon would probably have found in her a most excellent lady, worthy of\nall respect and esteem, and would have treated her with profound\ndeference and sedulous courtesy. When she proved to be a young and\nhandsome woman, of the type that he admired most, he was capable of any\ndegree of infatuation.  His mother had for a long time wanted him to\nmarry the orphan daughter of an old friend, a vivacious blonde, who\nworshiped him.  He had felt friendly towards her, but had shrunk from\nmatrimony. He did not want her badly enough to give up his freedom.\nThe war had interfered with his education, and though fairly well\ninstructed, he had never attended college.  In his own opinion, he\nought to see something of the world, and have his youthful fling.\nLater on, when he got ready to settle down, if Blanche were still in\nthe humor, they might marry, and sink to the humdrum level of other old\nmarried people.  The fact that Blanche Leary was visiting his mother\nduring his unexpectedly long absence had not operated at all to hasten\nhis return to North Carolina.  He had been having a very good time at\nClarence, and, at the distance of several hundred miles, was safe for\nthe time being from any immediate danger of marriage.\n\nWith Rena's advent, however, he had seen life through different\nglasses.  His heart had thrilled at first sight of this tall girl, with\nthe ivory complexion, the rippling brown hair, and the inscrutable\neyes.  When he became better acquainted with her, he liked to think\nthat her thoughts centred mainly in himself; and in this he was not far\nwrong.  He discovered that she had a short upper lip, and what seemed\nto him an eminently kissable mouth.  After he had dined twice at\nWarwick's, subsequently to the tournament,--his lucky choice of Rena\nhad put him at once upon a household footing with the family,--his\nviews of marriage changed entirely.  It now seemed to him the duty, as\nwell as the high and holy privilege of a young man, to marry and\nmanfully to pay his debt to society.  When in Rena's presence, he could\nnot imagine how he had ever contemplated the possibility of marriage\nwith Blanche Leary,--she was utterly, entirely, and hopelessly unsuited\nto him.  For a fair man of vivacious temperament, this stately dark\ngirl was the ideal mate.  Even his mother would admit this, if she\ncould only see Rena.  To win this beautiful girl for his wife would be\na worthy task.  He had crowned her Queen of Love and Beauty; since then\nshe had ascended the throne of his heart. He would make her queen of\nhis home and mistress of his life.\n\nTo Rena this brief month's courtship came as a new education.  Not only\nhad this fair young man crowned her queen, and honored her above all\nthe ladies in town; but since then he had waited assiduously upon her,\nhad spoken softly to her, had looked at her with shining eyes, and had\nsought to be alone with her.  The time soon came when to touch his hand\nin greeting sent a thrill through her frame,--a time when she listened\nfor his footstep and was happy in his presence.  He had been bold\nenough at the tournament; he had since become somewhat bashful and\nconstrained.  He must be in love, she thought, and wondered how soon he\nwould speak.  If it were so sweet to walk with him in the garden, or\nalong the shaded streets, to sit with him, to feel the touch of his\nhand, what happiness would it not be to hear him say that he loved\nher--to bear his name, to live with him always.  To be thus loved and\nhonored by this handsome young man,--she could hardly believe it\npossible.  He would never speak--he would discover her secret and\nwithdraw.  She turned pale at the thought,--ah, God! something would\nhappen,--it was too good to be true.  The Prince would never try on the\nglass slipper.\n\nTryon first told his love for Rena one summer evening on their way home\nfrom church.  They were walking in the moonlight along the quiet\nstreet, which, but for their presence, seemed quite deserted.\n\n\"Miss Warwick--Rowena,\" he said, clasping with his right hand the hand\nthat rested on his left arm, \"I love you!  Do you--love me?\"\n\nTo Rena this simple avowal came with much greater force than a more\nformal declaration could have had.  It appealed to her own simple\nnature. Indeed, few women at such a moment criticise the form in which\nthe most fateful words of life--but one--are spoken.  Words, while\npleasant, are really superfluous.  Her whispered \"Yes\" spoke volumes.\n\nThey walked on past the house, along the country road into which the\nstreet soon merged.  When they returned, an hour later, they found\nWarwick seated on the piazza, in a rocking-chair, smoking a fragrant\ncigar.\n\n\"Well, children,\" he observed with mock severity, \"you are late in\ngetting home from church.  The sermon must have been extremely long.\"\n\n\"We have been attending an after-meeting,\" replied Tryon joyfully, \"and\nhave been discussing an old text, 'Little children, love one another,'\nand its corollary, 'It is not good for man to live alone.'  John, I am\nthe happiest man alive.  Your sister has promised to marry me.  I\nshould like to shake my brother's hand.\"\n\nNever does one feel so strongly the universal brotherhood of man as\nwhen one loves some other fellow's sister.  Warwick sprang from his\nchair and clasped Tryon's extended hand with real emotion. He knew of\nno man whom he would have preferred to Tryon as a husband for his\nsister.\n\n\"My dear George--my dear sister,\" he exclaimed, \"I am very, very glad.\nI wish you every happiness.  My sister is the most fortunate of women.\"\n\n\"And I am the luckiest of men,\" cried Tryon.\n\n\"I wish you every happiness,\" repeated Warwick; adding, with a touch of\nsolemnity, as a certain thought, never far distant, occurred to him, \"I\nhope that neither of you may ever regret your choice.\"\n\nThus placed upon the footing of an accepted lover, Tryon's visits to\nthe house became more frequent.  He wished to fix a time for the\nmarriage, but at this point Rena developed a strange reluctance.\n\n\"Can we not love each other for a while?\" she asked.  \"To be engaged is\na pleasure that comes but once; it would be a pity to cut it too short.\"\n\n\"It is a pleasure that I would cheerfully dispense with,\" he replied,\n\"for the certainty of possession. I want you all to myself, and all the\ntime.  Things might happen.  If I should die, for instance, before I\nmarried you\"--\n\n\"Oh, don't suppose such awful things,\" she cried, putting her hand over\nhis mouth.\n\nHe held it there and kissed it until she pulled it away.\n\n\"I should consider,\" he resumed, completing the sentence, \"that my life\nhad been a failure.\"\n\n\"If I should die,\" she murmured, \"I should die happy in the knowledge\nthat you had loved me.\"\n\n\"In three weeks,\" he went on, \"I shall have finished my business in\nClarence, and there will be but one thing to keep me here.  When shall\nit be? I must take you home with me.\"\n\n\"I will let you know,\" she replied, with a troubled sigh, \"in a week\nfrom to-day.\"\n\n\"I'll call your attention to the subject every day in the mean time,\"\nhe asserted.  \"I shouldn't like you to forget it.\"\n\nRena's shrinking from the irrevocable step of marriage was due to a\nsimple and yet complex cause.  Stated baldly, it was the consciousness\nof her secret; the complexity arose out of the various ways in which it\nseemed to bear upon her future.  Our lives are so bound up with those\nof our fellow men that the slightest departure from the beaten path\ninvolves a multiplicity of small adjustments.  It had not been\ndifficult for Rena to conform her speech, her manners, and in a measure\nher modes of thought, to those of the people around her; but when this\nreadjustment went beyond mere externals and concerned the vital issues\nof life, the secret that oppressed her took on a more serious aspect,\nwith tragic possibilities. A discursive imagination was not one of her\ncharacteristics, or the danger of a marriage of which perfect frankness\nwas not a condition might well have presented itself before her heart\nhad become involved.  Under the influence of doubt and fear acting upon\nlove, the invisible bar to happiness glowed with a lambent flame that\nthreatened dire disaster.\n\n\"Would he have loved me at all,\" she asked herself, \"if he had known\nthe story of my past? Or, having loved me, could he blame me now for\nwhat I cannot help?\"\n\nThere were two shoals in the channel of her life, upon either of which\nher happiness might go to shipwreck.  Since leaving the house behind\nthe cedars, where she had been brought into the world without her own\nknowledge or consent, and had first drawn the breath of life by the\ninvoluntary contraction of certain muscles, Rena had learned, in a\nshort time, many things; but she was yet to learn that the innocent\nsuffer with the guilty, and feel the punishment the more keenly because\nunmerited.  She had yet to learn that the old Mosaic formula, \"The sins\nof the fathers shall be visited upon the children,\" was graven more\nindelibly upon the heart of the race than upon the tables of Sinai.\n\nBut would her lover still love her, if he knew all?  She had read some\nof the novels in the bookcase in her mother's hall, and others at\nboarding-school.  She had read that love was a conqueror, that neither\nlife nor death, nor creed nor caste, could stay his triumphant course.\nHer secret was no legal bar to their union.  If Rena could forget the\nsecret, and Tryon should never know it, it would be no obstacle to\ntheir happiness.  But Rena felt, with a sinking of the heart, that\nhappiness was not a matter of law or of fact, but lay entirely within\nthe domain of sentiment.  We are happy when we think ourselves happy,\nand with a strange perversity we often differ from others with regard\nto what should constitute our happiness. Rena's secret was the worm in\nthe bud, the skeleton in the closet.\n\n\"He says that he loves me.  He DOES love me. Would he love me, if he\nknew?\"  She stood before an oval mirror brought from France by one of\nWarwick's wife's ancestors, and regarded her image with a coldly\ncritical eye.  She was as little vain as any of her sex who are endowed\nwith beauty.  She tried to place herself, in thus passing upon her own\nclaims to consideration, in the hostile attitude of society toward her\nhidden disability.  There was no mark upon her brow to brand her as\nless pure, less innocent, less desirable, less worthy to be loved, than\nthese proud women of the past who had admired themselves in this old\nmirror.\n\n\"I think a man might love me for myself,\" she murmured pathetically,\n\"and if he loved me truly, that he would marry me.  If he would not\nmarry me, then it would be because he didn't love me. I'll tell George\nmy secret.  If he leaves me, then he does not love me.\"\n\nBut this resolution vanished into thin air before it was fully\nformulated.  The secret was not hers alone; it involved her brother's\nposition, to whom she owed everything, and in less degree the future of\nher little nephew, whom she had learned to love so well.  She had the\nchoice of but two courses of action, to marry Tryon or to dismiss him.\nThe thought that she might lose him made him seem only more dear; to\nthink that he might leave her made her sick at heart.  In one week she\nwas bound to give him an answer; he was more likely to ask for it at\ntheir next meeting.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nDOUBTS AND FEARS\n\nRena's heart was too heavy with these misgivings for her to keep them\nto herself.  On the morning after the conversation with Tryon in which\nshe had promised him an answer within a week, she went into her\nbrother's study, where he usually spent an hour after breakfast before\ngoing to his office.  He looked up amiably from the book before him and\nread trouble in her face.\n\n\"Well, Rena, dear,\" he asked with a smile, \"what's the matter?  Is\nthere anything you want--money, or what?  I should like to have\nAladdin's lamp--though I'd hardly need it--that you might have no wish\nunsatisfied.\"\n\nHe had found her very backward in asking for things that she needed.\nGenerous with his means, he thought nothing too good for her.  Her\nsuccess had gratified his pride, and justified his course in taking her\nunder his protection.\n\n\"Thank you, John.  You give me already more than I need.  It is\nsomething else, John.  George wants me to say when I will marry him.  I\nam afraid to marry him, without telling him.  If he should find out\nafterwards, he might cast me off, or cease to love me.  If he did not\nknow it, I should be forever thinking of what he would do if he SHOULD\nfind it out; or, if I should die without his having learned it, I\nshould not rest easy in my grave for thinking of what he would have\ndone if he HAD found it out.\"\n\nWarwick's smile gave place to a grave expression at this somewhat\ncomprehensive statement.  He rose and closed the door carefully, lest\nsome one of the servants might overhear the conversation. More\nliberally endowed than Rena with imagination, and not without a vein of\nsentiment, he had nevertheless a practical side that outweighed them\nboth.  With him, the problem that oppressed his sister had been in the\nmain a matter of argument, of self-conviction.  Once persuaded that he\nhad certain rights, or ought to have them, by virtue of the laws of\nnature, in defiance of the customs of mankind, he had promptly sought\nto enjoy them. This he had been able to do by simply concealing his\nantecedents and making the most of his opportunities, with no\ntroublesome qualms of conscience whatever.  But he had already\nperceived, in their brief intercourse, that Rena's emotions, while less\neasily stirred, touched a deeper note than his, and dwelt upon it with\ngreater intensity than if they had been spread over the larger field to\nwhich a more ready sympathy would have supplied so many points of\naccess;--hers was a deep and silent current flowing between the narrow\nwalls of a self-contained life, his the spreading river that ran\nthrough a pleasant landscape.  Warwick's imagination, however, enabled\nhim to put himself in touch with her mood and recognize its bearings\nupon her conduct.  He would have preferred her taking the practical\npoint of view, to bring her round to which he perceived would be a\nmatter of diplomacy.\n\n\"How long have these weighty thoughts been troubling your small head?\"\nhe asked with assumed lightness.\n\n\"Since he asked me last night to name our wedding day.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" continued Warwick, \"you take too tragic a view of\nlife.  Marriage is a reciprocal arrangement, by which the contracting\nparties give love for love, care for keeping, faith for faith.  It is a\nmatter of the future, not of the past.  What a poor soul it is that has\nnot some secret chamber, sacred to itself; where one can file away the\nthings others have no right to know, as well as things that one himself\nwould fain forget!  We are under no moral obligation to inflict upon\nothers the history of our past mistakes, our wayward thoughts, our\nsecret sins, our desperate hopes, or our heartbreaking disappointments.\nStill less are we bound to bring out from this secret chamber the dusty\nrecord of our ancestry.\n\n     'Let the dead past bury its dead.'\n\nGeorge Tryon loves you for yourself alone; it is not your ancestors\nthat he seeks to marry.\"\n\n\"But would he marry me if he knew?\" she persisted.\n\nWarwick paused for reflection.  He would have preferred to argue the\nquestion in a general way, but felt the necessity of satisfying her\nscruples, as far as might be.  He had liked Tryon from the very\nbeginning of their acquaintance.  In all their intercourse, which had\nbeen very close for several months, he had been impressed by the young\nman's sunny temper, his straightforwardness, his intellectual honesty.\nTryon's deference to Warwick as the elder man had very naturally proved\nan attraction.  Whether this friendship would have stood the test of\nutter frankness about his own past was a merely academic speculation\nwith which Warwick did not trouble himself.  With his sister the\nquestion had evidently become a matter of conscience,--a difficult\nsubject with which to deal in a person of Rena's temperament.\n\n\"My dear sister,\" he replied, \"why should he know?  We haven't asked\nhim for his pedigree; we don't care to know it.  If he cares for ours,\nhe should ask for it, and it would then be time enough to raise the\nquestion.  You love him, I imagine, and wish to make him happy?\"\n\nIt is the highest wish of the woman who loves. The enamored man seeks\nhis own happiness; the loving woman finds no sacrifice too great for\nthe loved one.  The fiction of chivalry made man serve woman; the fact\nof human nature makes woman happiest when serving where she loves.\n\n\"Yes, oh, yes,\" Rena exclaimed with fervor, clasping her hands\nunconsciously.  \"I'm afraid he'd be unhappy if he knew, and it would\nmake me miserable to think him unhappy.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Warwick, \"suppose we should tell him our secret and\nput ourselves in his power, and that he should then conclude that he\ncouldn't marry you?  Do you imagine he would be any happier than he is\nnow, or than if he should never know?\"\n\nAh, no! she could not think so.  One could not tear love out of one's\nheart without pain and suffering.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.  Warwick opened it to the nurse, who\nstood with little Albert in her arms.\n\n\"Please, suh,\" said the girl, with a curtsy, \"de baby 's be'n oryin'\nan' frettin' fer Miss Rena, an' I 'lowed she mought want me ter fetch\n'im, ef it wouldn't 'sturb her.\"\n\n\"Give me the darling,\" exclaimed Rena, coming forward and taking the\nchild from the nurse.  \"It wants its auntie.  Come to its auntie, bless\nits little heart!\"\n\nLittle Albert crowed with pleasure and put up his pretty mouth for a\nkiss.  Warwick found the sight a pleasant one.  If he could but quiet\nhis sister's troublesome scruples, he might erelong see her fondling\nbeautiful children of her own.  Even if Rena were willing to risk her\nhappiness, and he to endanger his position, by a quixotic frankness,\nthe future of his child must not be compromised.\n\n\"You wouldn't want to make George unhappy,\" Warwick resumed when the\nnurse retired.  \"Very well; would you not be willing, for his sake, to\nkeep a secret--your secret and mine, and that of the innocent child in\nyour arms?  Would you involve all of us in difficulties merely to\nsecure your own peace of mind?  Doesn't such a course seem just the\nleast bit selfish?  Think the matter over from that point of view, and\nwe'll speak of it later in the day.  I shall be with George all the\nmorning, and I may be able, by a little management, to find out his\nviews on the subject of birth and family, and all that.  Some men are\nvery liberal, and love is a great leveler.  I'll sound him, at any\nrate.\"\n\nHe kissed the baby and left Rena to her own reflections, to which his\npresentation of the case had given a new turn.  It had never before\noccurred to her to regard silence in the light of self-sacrifice. It\nhad seemed a sort of sin; her brother's argument made of it a virtue.\nIt was not the first time, nor the last, that right and wrong had been\na matter of view-point.\n\nTryon himself furnished the opening for Warwick's proposed examination.\nThe younger man could not long remain silent upon the subject uppermost\nin his mind.  \"I am anxious, John,\" he said, \"to have Rowena name the\nhappiest day of my life--our wedding day.  When the trial in Edgecombe\nCounty is finished, I shall have no further business here, and shall be\nready to leave for home. I should like to take my bride with me, and\nsurprise my mother.\"\n\nMothers, thought Warwick, are likely to prove inquisitive about their\nsons' wives, especially when taken unawares in matters of such\nimportance. This seemed a good time to test the liberality of Tryon's\nviews, and to put forward a shield for his sister's protection.\n\n\"Are you sure, George, that your mother will find the surprise\nagreeable when you bring home a bride of whom you know so little and\nyour mother nothing at all?\"\n\nTryon had felt that it would be best to surprise his mother.  She would\nneed only to see Rena to approve of her, but she was so far prejudiced\nin favor of Blanche Leary that it would be wisest to present the\nargument after having announced the irrevocable conclusion.  Rena\nherself would be a complete justification for the accomplished deed.\n\n\"I think you ought to know, George,\" continued Warwick, without waiting\nfor a reply to his question, \"that my sister and I are not of an old\nfamily, or a rich family, or a distinguished family; that she can bring\nyou nothing but herself; that we have no connections of which you could\nboast, and no relatives to whom we should be glad to introduce you.\nYou must take us for ourselves alone--we are new people.\"\n\n\"My dear John,\" replied the young man warmly, \"there is a great deal of\nnonsense about families.  If a man is noble and brave and strong, if a\nwoman is beautiful and good and true, what matters it about his or her\nancestry?  If an old family can give them these things, then it is\nvaluable; if they possess them without it, then of what use is it,\nexcept as a source of empty pride, which they would be better without?\nIf all new families were like yours, there would be no advantage in\nbelonging to an old one.  All I care to know of Rowena's family is that\nshe is your sister; and you'll pardon me, old fellow, if I add that she\nhardly needs even you,--she carries the stamp of her descent upon her\nface and in her heart.\"\n\n\"It makes me glad to hear you speak in that way,\" returned Warwick,\ndelighted by the young man's breadth and earnestness.\n\n\"Oh, I mean every word of it,\" replied Tryon. \"Ancestors, indeed, for\nRowena!  I will tell you a family secret, John, to prove how little I\ncare for ancestors.  My maternal great-great-grandfather, a hundred and\nfifty years ago, was hanged, drawn, and quartered for stealing cattle\nacross the Scottish border.  How is that for a pedigree?  Behold in me\nthe lineal descendant of a felon!\"\n\nWarwick felt much relieved at this avowal. His own statement had not\ntouched the vital point involved; it had been at the best but a\nhalf-truth; but Tryon's magnanimity would doubtless protect Rena from\nany close inquiry concerning her past. It even occurred to Warwick for\na moment that he might safely disclose the secret to Tryon; but an\nappreciation of certain facts of history and certain traits of human\nnature constrained him to put the momentary thought aside.  It was a\ngreat relief, however, to imagine that Tryon might think lightly of\nthis thing that he need never know.\n\n\"Well, Rena,\" he said to his sister when he went home at noon:  \"I've\nsounded George.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" she asked eagerly.\n\n\"I told him we were people of no family, and that we had no relatives\nthat we were proud of. He said he loved you for yourself, and would\nnever ask you about your ancestry.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad!\" exclaimed Rena joyfully. This report left her very\nhappy for about three hours, or until she began to analyze carefully\nher brother's account of what had been said.  Warwick's statement had\nnot been specific,--he had not told Tryon THE thing.  George's reply,\nin turn, had been a mere generality.  The concrete fact that oppressed\nher remained unrevealed, and her doubt was still unsatisfied.\n\nRena was occupied with this thought when her lover next came to see\nher.  Tryon came up the sanded walk from the gate and spoke pleasantly\nto the nurse, a good-looking yellow girl who was seated on the front\nsteps, playing with little Albert.  He took the boy from her arms, and\nshe went to call Miss Warwick.\n\nRena came out, followed by the nurse, who offered to take the child.\n\n\"Never mind, Mimy, leave him with me,\" said Tryon.\n\nThe nurse walked discreetly over into the garden, remaining within\ncall, but beyond the hearing of conversation in an ordinary tone.\n\n\"Rena, darling,\" said her lover, \"when shall it be?  Surely you won't\nask me to wait a week. Why, that's a lifetime!\"\n\nRena was struck by a brilliant idea.  She would test her lover.  Love\nwas a very powerful force; she had found it the greatest, grandest,\nsweetest thing in the world.  Tryon had said that he loved her; he had\nsaid scarcely anything else for several weeks, surely nothing else\nworth remembering. She would test his love by a hypothetical question.\n\n\"You say you love me,\" she said, glancing at him with a sad\nthoughtfulness in her large dark eyes.  \"How much do you love me?\"\n\n\"I love you all one can love.  True love has no degrees; it is all or\nnothing!\"\n\n\"Would you love me,\" she asked, with an air of coquetry that masked her\nconcern, pointing toward the girl in the shrubbery, \"if I were Albert's\nnurse yonder?\"\n\n\"If you were Albert's nurse,\" he replied, with a joyous laugh, \"he\nwould have to find another within a week, for within a week we should\nbe married.\"\n\nThe answer seemed to fit the question, but in fact, Tryon's mind and\nRena's did not meet.  That two intelligent persons should each attach a\ndifferent meaning to so simple a form of words as Rena's question was\nthe best ground for her misgiving with regard to the marriage.  But\nlove blinded her.  She was anxious to be convinced. She interpreted the\nmeaning of his speech by her own thought and by the ardor of his\nglance, and was satisfied with the answer.\n\n\"And now, darling,\" pleaded Tryon, \"will you not fix the day that shall\nmake me happy?  I shall be ready to go away in three weeks.  Will you\ngo with me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, in a tumult of joy.  She would never need to tell\nhim her secret now.  It would make no difference with him, so far as\nshe was concerned; and she had no right to reveal her brother's secret.\nShe was willing to bury the past in forgetfulness, now that she knew it\nwould have no interest for her lover.\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE DREAM\n\nThe marriage was fixed for the thirtieth of the month, immediately\nafter which Tryon and his bride were to set out for North Carolina.\nWarwick would have liked it much if Tryon had lived in South Carolina;\nbut the location of his North Carolina home was at some distance from\nPatesville, with which it had no connection by steam or rail, and\nindeed lay altogether out of the line of travel to Patesville.  Rena\nhad no acquaintance with people of social standing in North Carolina;\nand with the added maturity and charm due to her improved\nopportunities, it was unlikely that any former resident of Patesville\nwho might casually meet her would see in the elegant young matron from\nSouth Carolina more than a passing resemblance to a poor girl who had\nonce lived in an obscure part of the old town.  It would of course be\nnecessary for Rena to keep away from Patesville; save for her mother's\nsake, she would hardly be tempted to go back.\n\nOn the twentieth of the month, Warwick set out with Tryon for the\ncounty seat of the adjoining county, to try one of the lawsuits which\nhad required Tryon's presence in South Carolina for so long a time.\nTheir destination was a day's drive from Clarence, behind a good horse,\nand the trial was expected to last a week.\n\n\"This week will seem like a year,\" said Tryon ruefully, the evening\nbefore their departure, \"but I'll write every day, and shall expect a\nletter as often.\"\n\n\"The mail goes only twice a week, George,\" replied Rena.\n\n\"Then I shall have three letters in each mail.\"\n\nWarwick and Tryon were to set out in the cool of the morning, after an\nearly breakfast.  Rena was up at daybreak that she might preside at the\nbreakfast-table and bid the travelers good-by.\n\n\"John,\" said Rena to her brother in the morning, \"I dreamed last night\nthat mother was ill.\"\n\n\"Dreams, you know, Rena,\" answered Warwick lightly, \"go by contraries.\nYours undoubtedly signifies that our mother, God bless her simple soul!\nis at the present moment enjoying her usual perfect health.  She was\nnever sick in her life.\"\n\nFor a few months after leaving Patesville with her brother, Rena had\nsuffered tortures of homesickness; those who have felt it know the\npang. The severance of old ties had been abrupt and complete.  At the\nschool where her brother had taken her, there had been nothing to\nrelieve the strangeness of her surroundings--no schoolmate from her own\ntown, no relative or friend of the family near by.  Even the\ncompensation of human sympathy was in a measure denied her, for Rena\nwas too fresh from her prison-house to doubt that sympathy would fail\nbefore the revelation of the secret the consciousness of which\noppressed her at that time like a nightmare.  It was not strange that\nRena, thus isolated, should have been prostrated by homesickness for\nseveral weeks after leaving Patesville.  When the paroxysm had passed,\nthere followed a dull pain, which gradually subsided into a resignation\nas profound, in its way, as had been her longing for home.  She loved,\nshe suffered, with a quiet intensity of which her outward demeanor gave\nno adequate expression. From some ancestral source she had derived a\nstrain of the passive fatalism by which alone one can submit\nuncomplainingly to the inevitable. By the same token, when once a thing\nhad been decided, it became with her a finality, which only some\nextraordinary stress of emotion could disturb. She had acquiesced in\nher brother's plan; for her there was no withdrawing; her homesickness\nwas an incidental thing which must be endured, as patiently as might\nbe, until time should have brought a measure of relief.\n\nWarwick had made provision for an occasional letter from Patesville, by\nleaving with his mother a number of envelopes directed to his address.\nShe could have her letters written, inclose them in these envelopes,\nand deposit them in the post-office with her own hand.  Thus the place\nof Warwick's residence would remain within her own knowledge, and his\nsecret would not be placed at the mercy of any wandering Patesvillian\nwho might perchance go to that part of South Carolina. By this simple\nmeans Rena had kept as closely in touch with her mother as Warwick had\nconsidered prudent; any closer intercourse was not consistent with\ntheir present station in life.\n\nThe night after Warwick and Tryon had ridden away, Rena dreamed again\nthat her mother was ill.  Better taught people than she, in regions\nmore enlightened than the South Carolina of that epoch, are disturbed\nat times by dreams.  Mis' Molly had a profound faith in them.  If God,\nin ancient times, had spoken to men in visions of the night, what\neasier way could there be for Him to convey his meaning to people of\nall ages?  Science, which has shattered many an idol and destroyed many\na delusion, has made but slight inroads upon the shadowy realm of\ndreams.  For Mis' Molly, to whom science would have meant nothing and\npsychology would have been a meaningless term, the land of dreams was\ncarefully mapped and bounded.  Each dream had some special\nsignificance, or was at least susceptible of classification under some\nsignificant head.  Dreams, as a general rule, went by contraries; but a\ndream three times repeated was a certain portent of the thing defined.\nRena's few years of schooling at Patesville and her months at\nCharleston had scarcely disturbed these hoary superstitions which lurk\nin the dim corners of the brain.  No lady in Clarence, perhaps, would\nhave remained undisturbed by a vivid dream, three times repeated, of\nsome event bearing materially upon her own life.\n\nThe first repetition of a dream was decisive of nothing, for two dreams\nmeant no more than one. The power of the second lay in the suspense,\nthe uncertainty, to which it gave rise.  Two doubled the chance of a\nthird.  The day following this second dream was an anxious one for\nRena.  She could not for an instant dismiss her mother from her\nthoughts, which were filled too with a certain self-reproach.  She had\nleft her mother alone; if her mother were really ill, there was no one\nat home to tend her with loving care.  This feeling grew in force,\nuntil by nightfall Rena had become very unhappy, and went to bed with\nthe most dismal forebodings.  In this state of mind, it is not\nsurprising that she now dreamed that her mother was lying at the point\nof death, and that she cried out with heart-rending pathos:--\n\n\"Rena, my darlin', why did you forsake yo'r pore old mother?  Come back\nto me, honey; I'll die ef I don't see you soon.\"\n\nThe stress of subconscious emotion engendered by the dream was powerful\nenough to wake Rena, and her mother's utterance seemed to come to her\nwith the force of a fateful warning and a great reproach.  Her mother\nwas sick and needed her, and would die if she did not come.  She felt\nthat she must see her mother,--it would be almost like murder to remain\naway from her under such circumstances.\n\nAfter breakfast she went into the business part of the town and\ninquired at what time a train would leave that would take her toward\nPatesville. Since she had come away from the town, a railroad had been\nopened by which the long river voyage might be avoided, and, making\nallowance for slow trains and irregular connections, the town of\nPatesville could be reached by an all-rail route in about twelve hours.\nCalling at the post-office for the family mail, she found there a\nletter from her mother, which she tore open in great excitement. It was\nwritten in an unpracticed hand and badly spelled, and was in effect as\nfollows:--\n\n\nMY DEAR DAUGHTER,--I take my pen in hand to let you know that I am not\nvery well.  I have had a kind of misery in my side for two weeks, with\npalpitations of the heart, and I have been in bed for three days.  I'm\nfeeling mighty poorly, but Dr. Green says that I'll get over it in a\nfew days. Old Aunt Zilphy is staying with me, and looking after things\ntolerably well.  I hope this will find you and John enjoying good\nhealth.  Give my love to John, and I hope the Lord will bless him and\nyou too.  Cousin Billy Oxendine has had a rising on his neck, and has\nhad to have it lanced. Mary B. has another young one, a boy this time.\nOld man Tom Johnson was killed last week while trying to whip black Jim\nBrown, who lived down on the Wilmington Road.  Jim has run away. There\nhas been a big freshet in the river, and it looked at one time as if\nthe new bridge would be washed away.\n\nFrank comes over every day or two and asks about you.  He says to tell\nyou that he don't believe you are coming back any more, but you are to\nremember him, and that foolishness he said about bringing you back from\nthe end of the world with his mule and cart.  He's very good to me, and\nbrings over shavings and kindling-wood, and made me a new well-bucket\nfor nothing.  It's a comfort to talk to him about you, though I haven't\ntold him where you are living.\n\nI hope this will find you and John both well, and doing well.  I should\nlike to see you, but if it's the Lord's will that I shouldn't, I shall\nbe thankful anyway that you have done what was the best for yourselves\nand your children, and that I have given you up for your own good.\n\n             Your affectionate mother,\n                         MARY WALDEN.\n\n\nRena shed tears over this simple letter, which, to her excited\nimagination, merely confirmed the warning of her dream.  At the date of\nits writing her mother had been sick in bed, with the symptoms of a\nserious illness.  She had no nurse but a purblind old woman.  Three\ndays of progressive illness had evidently been quite sufficient to\nreduce her parent to the condition indicated by the third dream.  The\nthought that her mother might die without the presence of any one who\nloved her pierced Rena's heart like a knife and lent wings to her feet.\nShe wished for the enchanted horse of which her brother had read to her\nso many years before on the front piazza of the house behind the\ncedars, that she might fly through the air to her dying mother's side.\nShe determined to go at once to Patesville.\n\nReturning home, she wrote a letter to Warwick inclosing their mother's\nletter, and stating that she had dreamed an alarming dream for three\nnights in succession; that she had left the house in charge of the\nservants and gone to Patesville; and that she would return as soon as\nher mother was out of danger.\n\nTo her lover she wrote that she had been called away to visit a\nsick-bed, and would return very soon, perhaps by the time he got back\nto Clarence. These letters Rena posted on her way to the train, which\nshe took at five o'clock in the afternoon. This would bring her to\nPatesville early in the morning of the following day.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nA LETTER AND A JOURNEY\n\nWar has been called the court of last resort. A lawsuit may with equal\naptness be compared to a battle--the parallel might be drawn very\nclosely all along the line.  First we have the casus belli, the cause\nof action; then the various protocols and proclamations and general\norders, by way of pleas, demurrers, and motions; then the preliminary\nskirmishes at the trial table; and then the final struggle, in which\nmight is quite as likely to prevail as right, victory most often\nresting with the strongest battalions, and truth and justice not seldom\noverborne by the weight of odds upon the other side.\n\nThe lawsuit which Warwick and Tryon had gone to try did not, however,\nreach this ultimate stage, but, after a three days' engagement,\nresulted in a treaty of peace.  The case was compromised and settled,\nand Tryon and Warwick set out on their homeward drive.  They stopped at\na farm-house at noon, and while at table saw the stage-coach from the\ntown they had just left, bound for their own destination.  In the\nmail-bag under the driver's seat were Rena's two letters; they had been\ndelivered at the town in the morning, and immediately remailed to\nClarence, in accordance with orders left at the post-office the evening\nbefore.  Tryon and Warwick drove leisurely homeward through the pines,\nall unconscious of the fateful squares of white paper moving along the\nroad a few miles before them, which a mother's yearning and a\ndaughter's love had thrown, like the apple of discord, into the narrow\ncircle of their happiness.\n\nThey reached Clarence at four o'clock.  Warwick got down from the buggy\nat his office.  Tryon drove on to his hotel, to make a hasty toilet\nbefore visiting his sweetheart.\n\nWarwick glanced at his mail, tore open the envelope addressed in his\nsister's handwriting, and read the contents with something like dismay.\nShe had gone away on the eve of her wedding, her lover knew not where,\nto be gone no one knew how long, on a mission which could not be\nfrankly disclosed.  A dim foreboding of disaster flashed across his\nmind.  He thrust the letter into his pocket, with others yet unopened,\nand started toward his home.  Reaching the gate, he paused a moment and\nthen walked on past the house.  Tryon would probably be there in a few\nminutes, and he did not care to meet him without first having had the\nopportunity for some moments of reflection. He must fix upon some line\nof action in this emergency.\n\nMeanwhile Tryon had reached his hotel and opened his mail.  The letter\nfrom Rena was read first, with profound disappointment.  He had really\nmade concessions in the settlement of that lawsuit--had yielded several\nhundred dollars of his just dues, in order that he might get back to\nRena three days earlier.  Now he must cool his heels in idleness for at\nleast three days before she would return.  It was annoying, to say the\nleast. He wished to know where she had gone, that he might follow her\nand stay near her until she should be ready to come back.  He might ask\nWarwick--no, she might have had some good reason for not having\nmentioned her destination.  She had probably gone to visit some of the\npoor relations of whom her brother had spoken so frankly, and she would\ndoubtless prefer that he should not see her amid any surroundings but\nthe best.  Indeed, he did not know that he would himself care to\nendanger, by suggestive comparisons, the fine aureole of superiority\nthat surrounded her.  She represented in her adorable person and her\npure heart the finest flower of the finest race that God had ever\nmade--the supreme effort of creative power, than which there could be\nno finer.  The flower would soon be his; why should he care to dig up\nthe soil in which it grew?\n\nTryon went on opening his letters.  There were several bills and\ncirculars, and then a letter from his mother, of which he broke the\nseal:--\n\n\nMY DEAREST GEORGE,--This leaves us well. Blanche is still with me, and\nwe are impatiently awaiting your return.  In your absence she seems\nalmost like a daughter to me.  She joins me in the hope that your\nlawsuits are progressing favorably, and that you will be with us soon.\n. . .\n\nOn your way home, if it does not keep you away from us too long, would\nit not be well for you to come by way of Patesville, and find out\nwhether there is any prospect of our being able to collect our claim\nagainst old Mr. Duncan McSwayne's estate?  You must have taken the\npapers with you, along with the rest, for I do not find them here.\nThings ought to be settled enough now for people to realize on some of\ntheir securities. Your grandfather always believed the note was good,\nand meant to try to collect it, but the war interfered.  He said to me,\nbefore he died, that if the note was ever collected, he would use the\nmoney to buy a wedding present for your wife.  Poor father! he is dead\nand gone to heaven; but I am sure that even there he would be happier\nif he knew the note was paid and the money used as he intended.\n\nIf you go to Patesville, call on my cousin, Dr. Ed. Green, and tell him\nwho you are.  Give him my love.  I haven't seen him for twenty years.\nHe used to be very fond of the ladies, a very gallant man.  He can\ndirect you to a good lawyer, no doubt.  Hoping to see you soon,\n\n             Your loving mother,\n                    ELIZABETH TRYON.\n\nP. S. Blanche joins me in love to you.\n\n\nThis affectionate and motherly letter did not give Tryon unalloyed\nsatisfaction.  He was glad to hear that his mother was well, but he had\nhoped that Blanche Leary might have finished her visit by this time.\nThe reasonable inference from the letter was that Blanche meant to\nawait his return.  Her presence would spoil the fine romantic flavor of\nthe surprise he had planned for his mother; it would never do to expose\nhis bride to an unannounced meeting with the woman whom he had tacitly\nrejected.  There would be one advantage in such a meeting: the\ncomparison of the two women would be so much in Rena's favor that his\nmother could not hesitate for a moment between them.  The situation,\nhowever, would have elements of constraint, and he did not care to\nexpose either Rena or Blanche to any disagreeable contingency.  It\nwould be better to take his wife on a wedding trip, and notify his\nmother, before he returned home, of his marriage.  In the extremely\nimprobable case that she should disapprove his choice after having seen\nhis wife, the ice would at least have been broken before his arrival at\nhome.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed suddenly, striking his knee with his hand, \"why\nshouldn't I run up to Patesville while Rena's gone?  I can leave here\nat five o'clock, and get there some time to-morrow morning.  I can\ntransact my business during the day, and get back the day after\nto-morrow; for Rena might return ahead of time, just as we did, and I\nshall want to be here when she comes; I'd rather wait a year for a\nlegal opinion on a doubtful old note than to lose one day with my love.\nThe train goes in twenty minutes.  My bag is already packed.  I'll just\ndrop a line to George and tell him where I've gone.\"\n\nHe put Rena's letter into his breast pocket, and turning to his trunk,\ntook from it a handful of papers relating to the claim in reference to\nwhich he was going to Patesville.  These he thrust into the same pocket\nwith Rena's letter; he wished to read both letter and papers while on\nthe train.  It would be a pleasure merely to hold the letter before his\neyes and look at the lines traced by her hand. The papers he wished to\nstudy, for the more practical purpose of examining into the merits of\nhis claim against the estate of Duncan McSwayne.\n\nWhen Warwick reached home, he inquired if Mr. Tryon had called.\n\n\"No, suh,\" answered the nurse, to whom he had put the question; \"he\nain't be'n here yet, suh.\"\n\nWarwick was surprised and much disturbed.\n\n\"De baby 's be'n cryin' for Miss Rena,\" suggested the nurse, \"an' I\ns'pec' he'd like to see you, suh.  Shall I fetch 'im?\"\n\n\"Yes, bring him to me.\"\n\nHe took the child in his arms and went out upon the piazza.  Several\nporch pillows lay invitingly near.  He pushed them toward the steps\nwith his foot, sat down upon one, and placed little Albert upon\nanother.  He was scarcely seated when a messenger from the hotel came\nup the walk from the gate and handed him a note.  At the same moment he\nheard the long shriek of the afternoon train leaving the station on the\nopposite side of the town.\n\nHe tore the envelope open anxiously, read the note, smiled a sickly\nsmile, and clenched the paper in his hand unconsciously.  There was\nnothing he could do.  The train had gone; there was no telegraph to\nPatesville, and no letter could leave Clarence for twenty-four hours.\nThe best laid schemes go wrong at times--the stanchest ships are\nsometimes wrecked, or skirt the breakers perilously.  Life is a sea,\nfull of strange currents and uncharted reefs--whoever leaves the\ntraveled path must run the danger of destruction.  Warwick was a\nlawyer, however, and accustomed to balance probabilities.\n\n\"He may easily be in Patesville a day or two without meeting her.  She\nwill spend most of her time at mother's bedside, and he will be\noccupied with his own affairs.\"\n\nIf Tryon should meet her--well, he was very much in love, and he had\nspoken very nobly of birth and blood.  Warwick would have preferred,\nnevertheless, that Tryon's theories should not be put to this\nparticular test.  Rena's scruples had so far been successfully\ncombated; the question would be opened again, and the situation\nunnecessarily complicated, if Tryon should meet Rena in Patesville.\n\n\"Will he or will he not?\" he asked himself. He took a coin from his\npocket and spun it upon the floor.  \"Heads, he sees her; tails, he does\nnot.\"\n\nThe coin spun swiftly and steadily, leaving upon the eye the impression\nof a revolving sphere.  Little Albert, left for a moment to his own\ndevices, had crept behind his father and was watching the whirling disk\nwith great pleasure.  He felt that he would like to possess this\ninteresting object.  The coin began to move more slowly, and was\nwabbling to its fall, when the child stretched forth his chubby fist\nand caught it ere it touched the floor.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTRYON GOES TO PATESVILLE\n\nTryon arrived in the early morning and put up at the Patesville Hotel,\na very comfortable inn. After a bath, breakfast, and a visit to the\nbarbershop, he inquired of the hotel clerk the way to the office of Dr.\nGreen, his mother's cousin.\n\n\"On the corner, sir,\" answered the clerk, \"by the market-house, just\nover the drugstore.  The doctor drove past here only half an hour ago.\nYou'll probably catch him in his office.\"\n\nTryon found the office without difficulty.  He climbed the stair, but\nfound no one in except a young colored man seated in the outer office,\nwho rose promptly as Tryon entered.\n\n\"No, suh,\" replied the man to Tryon's question, \"he ain't hyuh now.\nHe's gone out to see a patient, suh, but he'll be back soon.  Won't you\nset down in de private office an' wait fer 'im, suh?\"\n\nTryon had not slept well during his journey, and felt somewhat\nfatigued.  Through the open door of the next room he saw an inviting\narmchair, with a window at one side, and upon the other a table strewn\nwith papers and magazines.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I'll wait.\"\n\nHe entered the private office, sank into the armchair, and looked out\nof the window upon the square below.  The view was mildly interesting.\nThe old brick market-house with the tower was quite picturesque.  On a\nwagon-scale at one end the public weighmaster was weighing a load of\nhay.  In the booths under the wide arches several old negro women were\nfrying fish on little charcoal stoves--the odor would have been\nappetizing to one who had not breakfasted.  On the shady side stood\nhalf a dozen two-wheeled carts, loaded with lightwood and drawn by\ndiminutive steers, or superannuated army mules branded on the flank\nwith the cabalistic letters \"C. S. A.,\" which represented a vanished\ndream, or \"U. S. A.,\" which, as any negro about the market-house would\nhave borne witness, signified a very concrete fact.  Now and then a\nlady or gentleman passed with leisurely step--no one ever hurried in\nPatesville--or some poor white sandhiller slouched listlessly along\ntoward store or bar-room.\n\nTryon mechanically counted the slabs of gingerbread on the nearest\nmarket-stall, and calculated the cubical contents of several of the\nmeagre loads of wood.  Having exhausted the view, he turned to the\ntable at his elbow and picked up a medical journal, in which he read\nfirst an account of a marvelous surgical operation.  Turning the leaves\nidly, he came upon an article by a Southern writer, upon the perennial\nrace problem that has vexed the country for a century.  The writer\nmaintained that owing to a special tendency of the negro blood, however\ndiluted, to revert to the African type, any future amalgamation of the\nwhite and black races, which foolish and wicked Northern negrophiles\npredicted as the ultimate result of the new conditions confronting the\nSouth, would therefore be an ethnological impossibility; for the\nsmallest trace of negro blood would inevitably drag down the superior\nrace to the level of the inferior, and reduce the fair Southland,\nalready devastated by the hand of the invader, to the frightful level\nof Hayti, the awful example of negro incapacity.  To forefend their\nbeloved land, now doubly sanctified by the blood of her devoted sons\nwho had fallen in the struggle to maintain her liberties and preserve\nher property, it behooved every true Southron to stand firm against the\nabhorrent tide of radicalism, to maintain the supremacy and purity of\nhis all-pervading, all-conquering race, and to resist by every\navailable means the threatened domination of an inferior and degraded\npeople, who were set to rule hereditary freemen ere they had themselves\nscarce ceased to be slaves.\n\nWhen Tryon had finished the article, which seemed to him a\nwell-considered argument, albeit a trifle bombastic, he threw the book\nupon the table. Finding the armchair wonderfully comfortable, and\nfeeling the fatigue of his journey, he yielded to a drowsy impulse,\nleaned his head on the cushioned back of the chair, and fell asleep.\nAccording to the habit of youth, he dreamed, and pursuant to his own\nindividual habit, he dreamed of Rena.  They were walking in the\nmoonlight, along the quiet road in front of her brother's house.  The\nair was redolent with the perfume of flowers.  His arm was around her\nwaist.  He had asked her if she loved him, and was awaiting her answer\nin tremulous but confident expectation.  She opened her lips to speak.\nThe sound that came from them seemed to be:--\n\n\"Is Dr. Green in?  No?  Ask him, when he comes back, please, to call at\nour house as soon as he can.\"\n\nTryon was in that state of somnolence in which one may dream and yet be\naware that one is dreaming,--the state where one, during a dream,\ndreams that one pinches one's self to be sure that one is not dreaming.\nHe was therefore aware of a ringing quality about the words he had just\nheard that did not comport with the shadowy converse of a dream--an\nincongruity in the remark, too, which marred the harmony of the vision.\nThe shock was sufficient to disturb Tryon's slumber, and he struggled\nslowly back to consciousness. When fully awake, he thought he heard a\nlight footfall descending the stairs.\n\n\"Was there some one here?\" he inquired of the attendant in the outer\noffice, who was visible through the open door.\n\n\"Yas, suh,\" replied the boy, \"a young cullud 'oman wuz in jes' now,\naxin' fer de doctuh.\"\n\nTryon felt a momentary touch of annoyance that a negro woman should\nhave intruded herself into his dream at its most interesting point.\nNevertheless, the voice had been so real, his imagination had\nreproduced with such exactness the dulcet tones so dear to him, that he\nturned his head involuntarily and looked out of the window.  He could\njust see the flutter of a woman's skirt disappearing around the corner.\n\nA moment later the doctor came bustling in,--a plump, rosy man of fifty\nor more, with a frank, open countenance and an air of genial good\nnature. Such a doctor, Tryon fancied, ought to enjoy a wide popularity.\nHis mere presence would suggest life and hope and healthfulness.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" exclaimed the doctor cordially, after Tryon had\nintroduced himself, \"I'm delighted to meet you--or any one of the old\nblood. Your mother and I were sweethearts, long ago, when we both wore\npinafores, and went to see our grandfather at Christmas; and I met her\nmore than once, and paid her more than one compliment, after she had\ngrown to be a fine young woman. You're like her! too, but not quite so\nhandsome--you've more of what I suppose to be the Tryon favor, though I\nnever met your father.  So one of old Duncan McSwayne's notes went so\nfar as that? Well, well, I don't know where you won't find them.  One\nof them turned up here the other day from New York.\n\n\"The man you want to see,\" he added later in the conversation, \"is old\nJudge Straight.  He's getting somewhat stiff in the joints, but he\nknows more law, and more about the McSwayne estate, than any other two\nlawyers in town.  If anybody can collect your claim, Judge Straight\ncan.  I'll send my boy Dave over to his office.  Dave,\" he called to\nhis attendant, \"run over to Judge Straight's office and see if he's\nthere.\n\n\"There was a freshet here a few weeks ago,\" he want on, when the\ncolored man had departed, \"and they had to open the flood-gates and let\nthe water out of the mill pond, for if the dam had broken, as it did\ntwenty years ago, it would have washed the pillars from under the\njudge's office and let it down in the creek, and\"--\n\n\"Jedge Straight ain't in de office jes' now, suh,\" reported the\ndoctor's man Dave, from the head of the stairs.\n\n\"Did you ask when he'd be back?\"\n\n\"No, suh, you didn't tell me ter, suh.\"\n\n\"Well, now, go back and inquire.\n\n\"The niggers,\" he explained to Tryon, \"are getting mighty trifling\nsince they've been freed. Before the war, that boy would have been\naround there and back before you could say Jack Robinson; now, the lazy\nrascal takes his time just like a white man.\"\n\nDave returned more promptly than from his first trip.  \"Jedge\nStraight's dere now, suh,\" he said.  \"He's done come in.\"\n\n\"I'll take you right around and introduce you,\" said the doctor,\nrunning on pleasantly, like a babbling brook.  \"I don't know whether\nthe judge ever met your mother or not, but he knows a gentleman when he\nsees one, and will be glad to meet you and look after your affair.  See\nto the patients, Dave, and say I'll be back shortly, and don't forget\nany messages left for me.  Look sharp, now!  You know your failing!\"\n\nThey found Judge Straight in his office.  He was seated by the rear\nwindow, and had fallen into a gentle doze--the air of Patesville was\nconducive to slumber.  A visitor from some bustling city might have\nrubbed his eyes, on any but a market-day, and imagined the whole town\nasleep--that the people were somnambulists and did not know it.  The\njudge, an old hand, roused himself so skillfully, at the sound of\napproaching footsteps, that his visitors could not guess but that he\nhad been wide awake.  He shook hands with the doctor, and acknowledged\nthe introduction to Tryon with a rare old-fashioned courtesy, which the\nyoung man thought a very charming survival of the manners of a past and\nhappier age.\n\n\"No,\" replied the judge, in answer to a question by Dr. Green, \"I never\nmet his mother; I was a generation ahead of her.  I was at school with\nher father, however, fifty years ago--fifty years ago! No doubt that\nseems to you a long time, young gentleman?\"\n\n\"It is a long time, sir,\" replied Tryon.  \"I must live more than twice\nas long as I have in order to cover it.\"\n\n\"A long time, and a troubled time,\" sighed the judge.  \"I could wish\nthat I might see this unhappy land at peace with itself before I die.\nThings are in a sad tangle; I can't see the way out.  But the worst\nenemy has been slain, in spite of us.  We are well rid of slavery.\"\n\n\"But the negro we still have with us,\" remarked the doctor, \"for here\ncomes my man Dave.  What is it, Dave?\" he asked sharply, as the negro\nstuck his head in at the door.\n\n\"Doctuh Green,\" he said, \"I fuhgot ter tell you, suh, dat dat young\n'oman wuz at de office agin jes' befo' you come in, an' said fer you to\ngo right down an' see her mammy ez soon ez you could.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, and you've just remembered it!  I'm afraid you're entirely\ntoo forgetful for a doctor's office.  You forgot about old Mrs.\nLatimer, the other day, and when I got there she had almost choked to\ndeath.  Now get back to the office, and remember, the next time you\nforget anything, I'll hire another boy; remember that!  That boy's\nhead,\" he remarked to his companions, after Dave had gone, \"reminds me\nof nothing so much as a dried gourd, with a handful of cowpeas rattling\naround it, in lieu of gray matter.  An old woman out in Redbank got a\nfishbone in her throat, the other day, and nearly choked to death\nbefore I got there.  A white woman, sir, came very near losing her life\nbecause of a lazy, trifling negro!\"\n\n\"I should think you would discharge him, sir,\" suggested Tryon.\n\n\"What would be the use?\" rejoined the doctor. \"All negroes are alike,\nexcept that now and then there's a pretty woman along the border-line.\nTake this patient of mine, for instance,--I'll call on her after\ndinner, her case is not serious,--thirty years ago she would have made\nany man turn his head to look at her.  You know who I mean, don't you,\njudge?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I think so,\" said the judge promptly. \"I've transacted a little\nbusiness for her now and then.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether you've seen the daughter or not--I'm sure you\nhaven't for the past year or so, for she's been away.  But she's in\ntown now, and, by Jove, the girl is really beautiful. And I'm a judge\nof beauty.  Do you remember my wife thirty years ago, judge?\"\n\n\"She was a very handsome woman, Ed,\" replied the other judicially.  \"If\nI had been twenty years younger, I should have cut you out.\"\n\n\"You mean you would have tried.  But as I was saying, this girl is a\nbeauty; I reckon we might guess where she got some of it, eh, Judge?\nHuman nature is human nature, but it's a d--d shame that a man should\nbeget a child like that and leave it to live the life open for a negro.\nIf she had been born white, the young fellows would be tumbling over\none another to get her.  Her mother would have to look after her pretty\nclosely as things are, if she stayed here; but she disappeared\nmysteriously a year or two ago, and has been at the North, I'm told,\npassing for white. She'll probably marry a Yankee; he won't know any\nbetter, and it will serve him right--she's only too white for them.\nShe has a very striking figure, something on the Greek order, stately\nand slow-moving.  She has the manners of a lady, too--a beautiful\nwoman, if she is a nigger!\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Ed,\" remarked the judge dryly, \"that the\nmother had better look closely after the daughter.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, judge,\" replied the other, with a flattered smile, \"my\nadmiration for beauty is purely abstract.  Twenty-five years ago, when\nI was younger\"--\n\n\"When you were young,\" corrected the judge.\n\n\"When you and I were younger,\" continued the doctor\ningeniously,--\"twenty-five years ago, I could not have answered for\nmyself.  But I would advise the girl to stay at the North, if she can.\nShe's certainly out of place around here.\"\n\nTryon found the subject a little tiresome, and the doctor's enthusiasm\nnot at all contagious.  He could not possibly have been interested in a\ncolored girl, under any circumstances, and he was engaged to be married\nto the most beautiful white woman on earth.  To mention a negro woman\nin the same room where he was thinking of Rena seemed little short of\nprofanation.  His friend the doctor was a jovial fellow, but it was\nsurely doubtful taste to refer to his wife in such a conversation. He\nwas very glad when the doctor dropped the subject and permitted him to\ngo more into detail about the matter which formed his business in\nPatesville.  He took out of his pocket the papers concerning the\nMcSwayne claim and laid them on the judge's desk.\n\n\"You'll find everything there, sir,--the note, the contract, and some\ncorrespondence that will give you the hang of the thing.  Will you be\nable to look over them to-day?  I should like,\" he added a little\nnervously, \"to go back to-morrow.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Dr. Green vivaciously, \"insult our town by staying\nonly one day?  It won't be long enough to get acquainted with our young\nladies.  Patesville girls are famous for their beauty.  But perhaps\nthere's a loadstone in South Carolina to draw you back?  Ah, you change\ncolor! To my mind there's nothing finer than the ingenuous blush of\nyouth.  But we'll spare you if you'll answer one question--is it\nserious?\"\n\n\"I'm to be married in two weeks, sir,\" answered Tryon.  The statement\nsounded very pleasant, in spite of the slight embarrassment caused by\nthe inquiry.\n\n\"Good boy!\" rejoined the doctor, taking his arm familiarly--they were\nboth standing now. \"You ought to have married a Patesville girl, but\nyou people down towards the eastern counties seldom come this way, and\nwe are evidently too late to catch you.\"\n\n\"I'll look your papers over this morning,\" said the judge, \"and when I\ncome from dinner will stop at the court house and examine the records\nand see whether there's anything we can get hold of.  If you'll drop in\naround three or four o'clock, I may be able to give you an opinion.\"\n\n\"Now, George,\" exclaimed the doctor, \"we'll go back to the office for a\nspell, and then I'll take you home with me to luncheon.\"\n\nTryon hesitated.\n\n\"Oh, you must come!  Mrs. Green would never forgive me if I didn't\nbring you.  Strangers are rare birds in our society, and when they come\nwe make them welcome.  Our enemies may overturn our institutions, and\ntry to put the bottom rail on top, but they cannot destroy our Southern\nhospitality. There are so many carpet-baggers and other social vermin\ncreeping into the South, with the Yankees trying to force the niggers\non us, that it's a genuine pleasure to get acquainted with another real\nSouthern gentleman, whom one can invite into one's house without fear\nof contamination, and before whom one can express his feelings freely\nand be sure of perfect sympathy.\"\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nAN INJUDICIOUS PAYMENT\n\nWhen Judge Straight's visitors had departed, he took up the papers\nwhich had been laid loosely on the table as they were taken out of\nTryon's breast-pocket, and commenced their perusal.  There was a note\nfor five hundred dollars, many years overdue, but not yet outlawed by\nlapse of time; a contract covering the transaction out of which the\nnote had grown; and several letters and copies of letters modifying the\nterms of the contract.  The judge had glanced over most of the papers,\nand was getting well into the merits of the case, when he unfolded a\nletter which read as follows:--\n\n\nMY DEAREST GEORGE,--I am going away for about a week, to visit the\nbedside of an old friend, who is very ill, and may not live.  Do not be\nalarmed about me, for I shall very likely be back by the time you are.\n\n             Yours lovingly,\n                         ROWENA WARWICK.\n\n\nThe judge was unable to connect this letter with the transaction which\nformed the subject of his examination.  Age had dimmed his perceptions\nsomewhat, and it was not until he had finished the letter, and read it\nover again, and noted the signature at the bottom a second time, that\nhe perceived that the writing was in a woman's hand, that the ink was\ncomparatively fresh, and that the letter was dated only a couple of\ndays before. While he still held the sheet in his hand, it dawned upon\nhim slowly that he held also one of the links in a chain of possible\ntragedy which he himself, he became uncomfortably aware, had had a hand\nin forging.\n\n\"It is the Walden woman's daughter, as sure as fate!  Her name is Rena.\nHer brother goes by the name of Warwick.  She has come to visit her\nsick mother.  My young client, Green's relation, is her lover--is\nengaged to marry her--is in town, and is likely to meet her!\"\n\nThe judge was so absorbed in the situation thus suggested that he laid\nthe papers down and pondered for a moment the curious problem involved.\nHe was quite aware that two races had not dwelt together, side by side,\nfor nearly three hundred years, without mingling their blood in greater\nor less degree; he was old enough, and had seen curious things enough,\nto know that in this mingling the current had not always flowed in one\ndirection.  Certain old decisions with which he was familiar; old\nscandals that had crept along obscure channels; old facts that had come\nto the knowledge of an old practitioner, who held in the hollow of his\nhand the honor of more than one family, made him know that there was\ndark blood among the white people--not a great deal, and that very much\ndiluted, and, so long as it was sedulously concealed or vigorously\ndenied, or lost in the mists of tradition, or ascribed to a foreign or\nan aboriginal strain, having no perceptible effect upon the racial type.\n\nSuch people were, for the most part, merely on the ragged edge of the\nwhite world, seldom rising above the level of overseers, or\nslave-catchers, or sheriff's officers, who could usually be relied upon\nto resent the drop of black blood that tainted them, and with the zeal\nof the proselyte to visit their hatred of it upon the unfortunate\nblacks that fell into their hands.  One curse of negro slavery was, and\none part of its baleful heritage is, that it poisoned the fountains of\nhuman sympathy. Under a system where men might sell their own children\nwithout social reprobation or loss of prestige, it was not surprising\nthat some of them should hate their distant cousins.  There were not in\nPatesville half a dozen persons capable of thinking Judge Straight's\nthoughts upon the question before him, and perhaps not another who\nwould have adopted the course he now pursued toward this anomalous\nfamily in the house behind the cedars.\n\n\"Well, here we are again, as the clown in the circus remarks,\" murmured\nthe judge.  \"Ten years ago, in a moment of sentimental weakness and of\nquixotic loyalty to the memory of an old friend,--who, by the way, had\nnot cared enough for his own children to take them away from the South,\nas he might have done, or to provide for them handsomely, as he perhaps\nmeant to do,--I violated the traditions of my class and stepped from\nthe beaten path to help the misbegotten son of my old friend out of the\nslough of despond, in which he had learned, in some strange way, that\nhe was floundering.  Ten years later, the ghost of my good deed returns\nto haunt me, and makes me doubt whether I have wrought more evil than\ngood.  I wonder,\" he mused, \"if he will find her out?\"\n\nThe judge was a man of imagination; he had read many books and had\npersonally outlived some prejudices.  He let his mind run on the\nvarious phases of the situation.\n\n\"If he found her out, would he by any possibility marry her?\"\n\n\"It is not likely,\" he answered himself.  \"If he made the discovery\nhere, the facts would probably leak out in the town.  It is something\nthat a man might do in secret, but only a hero or a fool would do\nopenly.\"\n\nThe judge sighed as he contemplated another possibility.  He had lived\nfor seventy years under the old regime.  The young man was a\ngentleman--so had been the girl's father.  Conditions were changed, but\nhuman nature was the same.  Would the young man's love turn to disgust\nand repulsion, or would it merely sink from the level of worship to\nthat of desire?  Would the girl, denied marriage, accept anything less?\nHer mother had,--but conditions were changed.  Yes, conditions were\nchanged, so far as the girl was concerned; there was a possible future\nfor her under the new order of things; but white people had not changed\ntheir opinion of the negroes, except for the worse.  The general belief\nwas that they were just as inferior as before, and had, moreover, been\nspoiled by a disgusting assumption of equality, driven into their thick\nskulls by Yankee malignity bent upon humiliating a proud though\nvanquished foe.\n\nIf the judge had had sons and daughters of his own, he might not have\ndone what he now proceeded to do.  But the old man's attitude toward\nsociety was chiefly that of an observer, and the narrow stream of\nsentiment left in his heart chose to flow toward the weaker party in\nthis unequal conflict,--a young woman fighting for love and opportunity\nagainst the ranked forces of society, against immemorial tradition,\nagainst pride of family and of race.\n\n\"It may be the unwisest thing I ever did,\" he said to himself, turning\nto his desk and taking up a quill pen, \"and may result in more harm\nthan good; but I was always from childhood in sympathy with the under\ndog.  There is certainly as much reason in my helping the girl as the\nboy, for being a woman, she is less able to help herself.\"\n\nHe dipped his pen into the ink and wrote the following lines:--\n\n\nMADAM,--If you value your daughter's happiness, keep her at home for\nthe next day or two.\n\n\nThis note he dried by sprinkling it with sand from a box near at hand,\nsigned with his own name, and, with a fine courtesy, addressed to \"Mrs.\nMolly Walden.\"  Having first carefully sealed it in an envelope, he\nstepped to the open door, and spied, playing marbles on the street near\nby, a group of negro boys, one of whom the judge called by name.\n\n\"Here, Billy,\" he said, handing the boy the note, \"take this to Mis'\nMolly Walden.  Do you know where she lives--down on Front Street, in\nthe house behind the cedars?\"\n\n\"Yas, suh, I knows de place.\"\n\n\"Make haste, now.  When you come back and tell me what she says, I'll\ngive you ten cents.  On second thoughts, I shall be gone to lunch, so\nhere's your money,\" he added, handing the lad the bit of soiled paper\nby which the United States government acknowledged its indebtedness to\nthe bearer in the sum of ten cents.\n\nJust here, however, the judge made his mistake. Very few mortals can\nspare the spring of hope, the motive force of expectation.  The boy\nkept the note in his hand, winked at his companions, who had gathered\nas near as their awe of the judge would permit, and started down the\nstreet.  As soon as the judge had disappeared, Billy beckoned to his\nfriends, who speedily overtook him.  When the party turned the corner\nof Front Street and were safely out of sight of Judge Straight's\noffice, the capitalist entered the grocery store and invested his\nunearned increment in gingerbread. When the ensuing saturnalia was\nover, Billy finished the game of marbles which the judge had\ninterrupted, and then set out to execute his commission.  He had nearly\nreached his objective point when he met upon the street a young white\nlady, whom he did not know, and for whom, the path being narrow at that\npoint, he stepped out into the gutter.  He reached the house behind the\ncedars, went round to the back door, and handed the envelope to Mis'\nMolly, who was seated on the rear piazza, propped up by pillows in a\ncomfortable rocking-chair.\n\n\"Laws-a-massy!\" she exclaimed weakly, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"It's a lettuh, ma'm,\" answered the boy, whose expanding nostrils had\ncaught a pleasant odor from the kitchen, and who was therefore in no\nhurry to go away.\n\n\"Who's it fur?\" she asked.\n\n\"It's fuh you, ma'm,\" replied the lad.\n\n\"An' who's it from?\" she inquired, turning the envelope over and over,\nand examining it with the impotent curiosity of one who cannot read.\n\n\"F'm ole Jedge Straight, ma'm.  He tole me ter fetch it ter you.  Is\nyou got a roasted 'tater you could gimme, ma'm?\"\n\n\"Shorely, chile.  I'll have Aunt Zilphy fetch you a piece of 'tater\npone, if you'll hol' on a minute.\"\n\nShe called to Aunt Zilphy, who soon came hobbling out of the kitchen\nwith a large square of the delicacy,--a flat cake made of mashed sweet\npotatoes, mixed with beaten eggs, sweetened and flavored to suit the\ntaste, and baked in a Dutch oven upon the open hearth.\n\nThe boy took the gratuity, thanked her, and turned to go.  Mis' Molly\nwas still scanning the superscription of the letter.  \"I wonder,\" she\nmurmured, \"what old Judge Straight can be writin' to me about.  Oh,\nboy!\"\n\n\"Yas 'm,\" answered the messenger, looking back.\n\n\"Can you read writin'?\"\n\n\"No 'm.\"\n\n\"All right.  Never mind.\"\n\nShe laid the letter carefully on the chimney-piece of the kitchen.  \"I\nreckon it's somethin' mo' 'bout the taxes,\" she thought, \"or maybe\nsomebody wants to buy one er my lots.  Rena'll be back terreckly, an'\nshe kin read it an' find out. I'm glad my child'en have be'n to school.\nThey never could have got where they are now if they hadn't.\"\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nA LOYAL FRIEND\n\nMention has been made of certain addressed envelopes which John\nWarwick, on the occasion of his visit to Patesville, had left with his\nilliterate mother, by the use of which she might communicate with her\nchildren from time to time. On one occasion, Mis' Molly, having had a\nletter written, took one of these envelopes from the chest where she\nkept her most valued possessions, and was about to inclose the letter\nwhen some one knocked at the back door.  She laid the envelope and\nletter on a table in her bedroom, and went to answer the knock.  The\nwind, blowing across the room through the open windows, picked up the\nenvelope and bore it into the street.  Mis' Molly, on her return,\nmissed it, looked for it, and being unable to find it, took another\nenvelope.  An hour or two later another gust of wind lifted the bit of\npaper from the ground and carried it into the open door of the cooper\nshop.  Frank picked it up, and observing that it was clean and unused,\nread the superscription.  In his conversations with Mis' Molly, which\nwere often about Rena,--the subject uppermost in both their minds,--he\nhad noted the mystery maintained by Mis' Molly about her daughter's\nwhereabouts, and had often wondered where she might be.  Frank was an\nintelligent fellow, and could put this and that together. The envelope\nwas addressed to a place in South Carolina.  He was aware, from some\ncasual remark of Mis' Molly's, that Rena had gone to live in South\nCarolina.  Her son's name was John--that he had changed his last name\nwas more than likely.  Frank was not long in reaching the conclusion\nthat Rena was to be found near the town named on the envelope, which he\ncarefully preserved for future reference.\n\nFor a whole year Frank had yearned for a smile or a kind word from the\nonly woman in the world. Peter, his father, had rallied him somewhat\nupon his moodiness after Rena's departure.\n\n\"Now 's de time, boy, fer you ter be lookin' roun' fer some nice gal er\nyo' own color, w'at'll 'preciate you, an' won't be 'shamed er you.\nYou're wastin' time, boy, wastin' time, shootin' at a mark outer yo'\nrange.\"\n\nBut Frank said nothing in reply, and afterwards the old man, who was\nnot without discernment, respected his son's mood and was silent in\nturn; while Frank fed his memory with his imagination, and by their\njoint aid kept hope alive.\n\nLater an opportunity to see her presented itself. Business in the\ncooper shop was dull.  A barrel factory had been opened in the town,\nand had well-nigh paralyzed the cooper's trade.  The best mechanic\ncould hardly compete with a machine. One man could now easily do the\nwork of Peter's shop.  An agent appeared in town seeking laborers for\none of the railroads which the newly organized carpet-bag governments\nwere promoting. Upon inquiry Frank learned that their destination was\nnear the town of Clarence, South Carolina. He promptly engaged himself\nfor the service, and was soon at work in the neighborhood of Warwick's\nhome.  There he was employed steadily until a certain holiday, upon\nwhich a grand tournament was advertised to take place in a neighboring\ntown.  Work was suspended, and foremen and laborers attended the\nfestivities.\n\nFrank had surmised that Rena would be present on such an occasion.  He\nhad more than guessed, too, that she must be looked for among the white\npeople rather than among the black.  Hence the interest with which he\nhad scanned the grand stand. The result has already been recounted.  He\nhad recognized her sweet face; he had seen her enthroned among the\nproudest and best.  He had witnessed and gloried in her triumph.  He\nhad seen her cheek flushed with pleasure, her eyes lit up with smiles.\nHe had followed her carriage, had made the acquaintance of Mimy the\nnurse, and had learned all about the family.  When finally he left the\nneighborhood to return to Patesville, he had learned of Tryon's\nattentions, and had heard the servants' gossip with reference to the\nmarriage, of which they knew the details long before the principals had\napproached the main fact.  Frank went away without having received one\nsmile or heard one word from Rena; but he had seen her: she was happy;\nhe was content in the knowledge of her happiness.  She was doubtless\nsecure in the belief that her secret was unknown.  Why should he, by\nrevealing his presence, sow the seeds of doubt or distrust in the\ngarden of her happiness?  He sacrificed the deepest longing of a\nfaithful heart, and went back to the cooper shop lest perchance she\nmight accidentally come upon him some day and suffer the shock which he\nhad sedulously spared her.\n\n\"I would n' want ter skeer her,\" he mused, \"er make her feel bad, an'\ndat's w'at I'd mos' lackly do ef she seed me.  She'll be better off wid\nme out'n de road.  She'll marry dat rich w'ite gent'eman,--he won't\nnever know de diffe'nce,--an' be a w'ite lady, ez she would 'a' be'n,\nef some ole witch had n' changed her in her cradle.  But maybe some\ntime she'll 'member de little nigger w'at use' ter nuss her w'en she\nwoz a chile, an' fished her out'n de ole canal, an' would 'a' died fer\nher ef it would 'a' done any good.\"\n\nVery generously too, and with a fine delicacy, he said nothing to Mis'\nMolly of his having seen her daughter, lest she might be disquieted by\nthe knowledge that he shared the family secret,--no great mystery now,\nthis pitiful secret, but more far-reaching in its consequences than any\nblood-curdling crime.  The taint of black blood was the unpardonable\nsin, from the unmerited penalty of which there was no escape except by\nconcealment.  If there be a dainty reader of this tale who scorns a\nlie, and who writes the story of his life upon his sleeve for all the\nworld to read, let him uncurl his scornful lip and come down from the\npedestal of superior morality, to which assured position and wide\nopportunity have lifted him, and put himself in the place of Rena and\nher brother, upon whom God had lavished his best gifts, and from whom\nsociety would have withheld all that made these gifts valuable. To\nundertake what they tried to do required great courage.  Had they\npossessed the sneaking, cringing, treacherous character traditionally\nascribed to people of mixed blood--the character which the blessed\ninstitutions of a free slave-holding republic had been well adapted to\nfoster among them; had they been selfish enough to sacrifice to their\nambition the mother who gave them birth, society would have been\nplacated or humbugged, and the voyage of their life might have been one\nof unbroken smoothness.\n\nWhen Rena came back unexpectedly at the behest of her dream, Frank\nheard again the music of her voice, felt the joy of her presence and\nthe benison of her smile.  There was, however, a subtle difference in\nher bearing.  Her words were not less kind, but they seemed to come\nfrom a remoter source.  She was kind, as the sun is warm or the rain\nrefreshing; she was especially kind to Frank, because he had been good\nto her mother.  If Frank felt the difference in her attitude, he\nascribed it to the fact that she had been white, and had taken on\nsomething of the white attitude toward the negro; and Frank, with an\nequal unconsciousness, clothed her with the attributes of the superior\nrace.  Only her drop of black blood, he conceived, gave him the right\nto feel toward her as he would never have felt without it; and if Rena\nguessed her faithful devotee's secret, the same reason saved his\nworship from presumption.  A smile and a kind word were little enough\nto pay for a life's devotion.\n\nOn the third day of Rena's presence in Patesville, Frank was driving up\nFront Street in the early afternoon, when he nearly fell off his cart\nin astonishment as he saw seated in Dr. Green's buggy, which was\nstanding in front of the Patesville Hotel, the young gentleman who had\nwon the prize at the tournament, and who, as he had learned, was to\nmarry Rena.  Frank was quite certain that she did not know of Tryon's\npresence in the town. Frank had been over to Mis' Molly's in the\nmorning, and had offered his services to the sick woman, who had\nrapidly become convalescent upon her daughter's return.  Mis' Molly had\nspoken of some camphor that she needed.  Frank had volunteered to get\nit.  Rena had thanked him, and had spoken of going to the drugstore\nduring the afternoon.  It was her intention to leave Patesville on the\nfollowing day.\n\n\"Ef dat man sees her in dis town,\" said Frank to himself, \"dere'll be\ntrouble.  She don't know HE'S here, an' I'll bet he don't know SHE'S\nhere.\"\n\nThen Frank was assailed by a very strong temptation.  If, as he\nsurmised, the joint presence of the two lovers in Patesville was a mere\ncoincidence, a meeting between them would probably result in the\ndiscovery of Rena's secret.\n\n\"If she's found out,\" argued the tempter, \"she'll come back to her\nmother, and you can see her every day.\"\n\nBut Frank's love was not of the selfish kind. He put temptation aside,\nand applied the whip to the back of his mule with a vigor that\nastonished the animal and moved him to unwonted activity.  In an\nunusually short space of time he drew up before Mis' Molly's back gate,\nsprang from the cart, and ran up to Mis' Molly on the porch.\n\n\"Is Miss Rena here?\" he demanded breathlessly.\n\n\"No, Frank; she went up town 'bout an hour ago to see the doctor an'\ngit me some camphor gum.\"\n\nFrank uttered a groan, rushed from the house, sprang into the cart, and\ngoaded the terrified mule into a gallop that carried him back to the\nmarket house in half the time it had taken him to reach Mis' Molly's.\n\n\"I wonder what in the worl 's the matter with Frank,\" mused Mis' Molly,\nin vague alarm.  \"Ef he hadn't be'n in such a hurry, I'd 'a' axed him\nto read Judge Straight's letter.  But Rena'll be home soon.\"\n\nWhen Frank reached the doctor's office, he saw Tryon seated in the\ndoctor's buggy, which was standing by the window of the drugstore.\nFrank ran upstairs and asked the doctor's man if Miss Walden had been\nthere.\n\n\"Yas,\" replied Dave, \"she wuz here a little w'ile ago, an' said she wuz\ngwine downstairs ter de drugsto'.  I would n' be s'prise' ef you'd fin'\nher dere now.\"\n\n\n\nXV\n\nMINE OWN PEOPLE\n\nThe drive by which Dr. Green took Tryon to his own house led up Front\nStreet about a mile, to the most aristocratic portion of the town,\nsituated on the hill known as Haymount, or, more briefly, \"The Hill.\"\nThe Hill had lost some of its former glory, however, for the blight of\na four years' war was everywhere.  After reaching the top of this\nwooded eminence, the road skirted for some little distance the brow of\nthe hill.  Below them lay the picturesque old town, a mass of vivid\ngreen, dotted here and there with gray roofs that rose above the\ntree-tops.  Two long ribbons of streets stretched away from the Hill to\nthe faint red line that marked the high bluff beyond the river at the\nfarther side of the town.  The market-house tower and the slender\nspires of half a dozen churches were sharply outlined against the green\nbackground.  The face of the clock was visible, but the hours could\nhave been read only by eyes of phenomenal sharpness. Around them\nstretched ruined walls, dismantled towers, and crumbling\nearthworks--footprints of the god of war, one of whose temples had\ncrowned this height.  For many years before the rebellion a Federal\narsenal had been located at Patesville. Seized by the state troops upon\nthe secession of North Carolina, it had been held by the Confederates\nuntil the approach of Sherman's victorious army, whereupon it was\nevacuated and partially destroyed.  The work of destruction begun by\nthe retreating garrison was completed by the conquerors, and now only\nruined walls and broken cannon remained of what had once been the chief\nornament and pride of Patesville.\n\nThe front of Dr. Green's spacious brick house, which occupied an\nideally picturesque site, was overgrown by a network of clinging vines,\ncontrasting most agreeably with the mellow red background.  A low brick\nwall, also overrun with creepers, separated the premises from the\nstreet and shut in a well-kept flower garden, in which Tryon, who knew\nsomething of plants, noticed many rare and beautiful specimens.\n\nMrs. Green greeted Tryon cordially.  He did not have the doctor's\nmemory with which to fill out the lady's cheeks or restore the lustre\nof her hair or the sparkle of her eyes, and thereby justify her\nhusband's claim to be a judge of beauty; but her kind-hearted\nhospitality was obvious, and might have made even a plain woman seem\nhandsome. She and her two fair daughters, to whom Tryon was duly\npresented, looked with much favor upon their handsome young kinsman;\nfor among the people of Patesville, perhaps by virtue of the prevalence\nof Scottish blood, the ties of blood were cherished as things of value,\nand never forgotten except in case of the unworthy--an exception, by\nthe way, which one need hardly go so far to seek.\n\nThe Patesville people were not exceptional in the weaknesses and\nmeannesses which are common to all mankind, but for some of the finer\nsocial qualities they were conspicuously above the average. Kindness,\nhospitality, loyalty, a chivalrous deference to women,--all these\nthings might be found in large measure by those who saw Patesville with\nthe eyes of its best citizens, and accepted their standards of\npolitics, religion, manners, and morals.\n\nThe doctor, after the introductions, excused himself for a moment.\nMrs. Green soon left Tryon with the young ladies and went to look after\nluncheon.  Her first errand, however, was to find the doctor.\n\n\"Is he well off, Ed?\" she asked her husband.\n\n\"Lots of land, and plenty of money, if he is ever able to collect it.\nHe has inherited two estates.\"\n\n\"He's a good-looking fellow,\" she mused.  \"Is he married?\"\n\n\"There you go again,\" replied her husband, shaking his forefinger at\nher in mock reproach. \"To a woman with marriageable daughters all roads\nlead to matrimony, the centre of a woman's universe.  All men must be\nsized up by their matrimonial availability.  No, he isn't married.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" she rejoined reflectively.  \"I think we ought to ask him\nto stay with us while he is in town, don't you?\"\n\n\"He's not married,\" rejoined the doctor slyly, \"but the next best\nthing--he's engaged.\"\n\n\"Come to think of it,\" said the lady, \"I'm afraid we wouldn't have the\nroom to spare, and the girls would hardly have time to entertain him.\nBut we'll have him up several times.  I like his looks.  I wish you had\nsent me word he was coming; I'd have had a better luncheon.\"\n\n\"Make him a salad,\" rejoined the doctor, \"and get out a bottle of the\nbest claret.  Thank God, the Yankees didn't get into my wine cellar!\nThe young man must be treated with genuine Southern hospitality,--even\nif he were a Mormon and married ten times over.\"\n\n\"Indeed, he would not, Ed,--the idea!  I'm ashamed of you.  Hurry back\nto the parlor and talk to him.  The girls may want to primp a little\nbefore luncheon; we don't have a young man every day.\"\n\n\"Beauty unadorned,\" replied the doctor, \"is adorned the most.  My\nprofession qualifies me to speak upon the subject.  They are the two\nhandsomest young women in Patesville, and the daughters of the most\nbeautiful\"--\n\n\"Don't you dare to say the word,\" interrupted Mrs. Green, with placid\ngood nature.  \"I shall never grow old while I am living with a big boy\nlike you.  But I must go and make the salad.\"\n\nAt dinner the conversation ran on the family connections and their\nvarying fortunes in the late war.  Some had died upon the battlefield,\nand slept in unknown graves; some had been financially ruined by their\nfaith in the \"lost cause,\" having invested their all in the securities\nof the Confederate Government.  Few had anything left but land, and\nland without slaves to work it was a drug in the market.\n\n\"I was offered a thousand acres, the other day, at twenty-five cents an\nacre,\" remarked the doctor. \"The owner is so land-poor that he can't\npay the taxes.  They have taken our negroes and our liberties.  It may\nbe better for our grandchildren that the negroes are free, but it's\nconfoundedly hard on us to take them without paying for them.  They may\nexalt our slaves over us temporarily, but they have not broken our\nspirit, and cannot take away our superiority of blood and breeding.  In\ntime we shall regain control.  The negro is an inferior creature; God\nhas marked him with the badge of servitude, and has adjusted his\nintellect to a servile condition.  We will not long submit to his\ndomination.  I give you a toast, sir:  The Anglo-Saxon race: may it\nremain forever, as now, the head and front of creation, never yielding\nits rights, and ready always to die, if need be, in defense of its\nliberties!\"\n\n\"With all my heart, sir,\" replied Tryon, who felt in this company a\nthrill of that pleasure which accompanies conscious superiority,--\"with\nall my heart, sir, if the ladies will permit me.\"\n\n\"We will join you,\" they replied.  The toast was drunk with great\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"And now, my dear George,\" exclaimed the doctor, \"to change one good\nsubject for another, tell us who is the favored lady?\"\n\n\"A Miss Rowena Warwick, sir,\" replied Tryon, vividly conscious of four\npairs of eyes fixed upon him, but, apart from the momentary\nembarrassment, welcoming the subject as the one he would most like to\nspeak upon.\n\n\"A good, strong old English name,\" observed the doctor.\n\n\"The heroine of 'Ivanhoe'!\" exclaimed Miss Harriet.\n\n\"Warwick the Kingmaker!\" said Miss Mary. \"Is she tall and fair, and\ndignified and stately?\"\n\n\"She is tall, dark rather than fair, and full of tender grace and sweet\nhumility.\"\n\n\"She should have been named Rebecca instead of Rowena,\" rejoined Miss\nMary, who was well up in her Scott.\n\n\"Tell us something about her people,\" asked Mrs. Green,--to which\ninquiry the young ladies looked assent.\n\nIn this meeting of the elect of his own class and kin Warwick felt a\ncertain strong illumination upon the value of birth and blood.  Finding\nRena among people of the best social standing, the subsequent\nintimation that she was a girl of no family had seemed a small matter\nto one so much in love. Nevertheless, in his present company he felt a\ndecided satisfaction in being able to present for his future wife a\nclean bill of social health.\n\n\"Her brother is the most prominent lawyer of Clarence.  They live in a\nfine old family mansion, and are among the best people of the town.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my boy,\" assented the doctor. \"None but the best are good\nenough for the best. You must bring her to Patesville some day.  But\nbless my life!\" he exclaimed, looking at his watch, \"I must be going.\nWill you stay with the ladies awhile, or go back down town with me?\"\n\n\"I think I had better go with you, sir.  I shall have to see Judge\nStraight.\"\n\n\"Very well.  But you must come back to supper, and we'll have a few\nfriends in to meet you. You must see some of the best people.\"\n\nThe doctor's buggy was waiting at the gate. As they were passing the\nhotel on their drive down town, the clerk came out to the curbstone and\ncalled to the doctor.\n\n\"There's a man here, doctor, who's been taken suddenly ill.  Can you\ncome in a minute?\"\n\n\"I suppose I'll have to.  Will you wait for me here, George, or will\nyou drive down to the office?  I can walk the rest of the way.\"\n\n\"I think I'll wait here, doctor,\" answered Tryon.  \"I'll step up to my\nroom a moment.  I'll be back by the time you're ready.\"\n\nIt was while they were standing before the hotel, before alighting from\nthe buggy, that Frank Fowler, passing on his cart, saw Tryon and set\nout as fast as he could to warn Mis' Molly and her daughter of his\npresence in the town.\n\nTryon went up to his room, returned after a while, and resumed his seat\nin the buggy, where he waited fifteen minutes longer before the doctor\nwas ready.  When they drew up in front of the office, the doctor's man\nDave was standing in the doorway, looking up the street with an anxious\nexpression, as though struggling hard to keep something upon his mind.\n\n\"Anything wanted, Dave?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Dat young 'oman's be'n heah ag'in, suh, an' wants ter see you bad.\nShe's in de drugstore dere now, suh.  Bless Gawd!\" he added to himself\nfervently, \"I 'membered dat.  Dis yer recommemb'ance er mine is gwine\nter git me inter trouble ef I don' look out, an' dat's a fac', sho'.\"\n\nThe doctor sprang from the buggy with an agility remarkable in a man of\nsixty.  \"Just keep your seat, George,\" he said to Tryon, \"until I have\nspoken to the young woman, and then we'll go across to Straight's.  Or,\nif you'll drive along a little farther, you can see the girl through\nthe window.  She's worth the trouble, if you like a pretty face.\"\n\nTryon liked one pretty face; moreover, tinted beauty had never appealed\nto him.  More to show a proper regard for what interested the doctor\nthan from any curiosity of his own, he drove forward a few feet, until\nthe side of the buggy was opposite the drugstore window, and then\nlooked in.\n\nBetween the colored glass bottles in the window he could see a young\nwoman, a tall and slender girl, like a lily on its stem.  She stood\ntalking with the doctor, who held his hat in his hand with as much\ndeference as though she were the proudest dame in town.  Her face was\npartly turned away from the window, but as Tryon's eye fell upon her,\nhe gave a great start.  Surely, no two women could be so much alike.\nThe height, the graceful droop of the shoulders, the swan-like poise of\nthe head, the well-turned little ear,--surely, no two women could have\nthem all identical!  But, pshaw! the notion was absurd, it was merely\nthe reflex influence of his morning's dream.\n\nShe moved slightly; it was Rena's movement. Surely he knew the gown,\nand the style of hair-dressing!  She rested her hand lightly on the\nback of a chair.  The ring that glittered on her finger could be none\nother than his own.\n\nThe doctor bowed.  The girl nodded in response, and, turning, left the\nstore.  Tryon leaned forward from the buggy-seat and kept his eye fixed\non the figure that moved across the floor of the drugstore. As she came\nout, she turned her face casually toward the buggy, and there could no\nlonger be any doubt as to her identity.\n\nWhen Rena's eyes fell upon the young man in the buggy, she saw a face\nas pale as death, with starting eyes, in which love, which once had\nreigned there, had now given place to astonishment and horror.  She\nstood a moment as if turned to stone.  One appealing glance she\ngave,--a look that might have softened adamant.  When she saw that it\nbrought no answering sign of love or sorrow or regret, the color faded\nfrom her cheek, the light from her eye, and she fell fainting to the\nground.\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nTHE BOTTOM FALLS OUT\n\nThe first effect of Tryon's discovery was, figuratively speaking, to\nknock the bottom out of things for him.  It was much as if a boat on\nwhich he had been floating smoothly down the stream of pleasure had\nsunk suddenly and left him struggling in deep waters.  The full\nrealization of the truth, which followed speedily, had for the moment\nreversed his mental attitude toward her, and love and yearning had\ngiven place to anger and disgust.  His agitation could hardly have\nescaped notice had not the doctor's attention, and that of the crowd\nthat quickly gathered, been absorbed by the young woman who had fallen.\nDuring the time occupied in carrying her into the drugstore, restoring\nher to consciousness, and sending her home in a carriage, Tryon had\ntime to recover in some degree his self-possession.  When Rena had been\ntaken home, he slipped away for a long walk, after which he called at\nJudge Straight's office and received the judge's report upon the matter\npresented.  Judge Straight had found the claim, in his opinion, a good\none; he had discovered property from which, in case the claim were\nallowed, the amount might be realized.  The judge, who had already been\ninformed of the incident at the drugstore, observed Tryon's\npreoccupation and guessed shrewdly at its cause, but gave no sign.\nTryon left the matter of the note unreservedly in the lawyer's hands,\nwith instructions to communicate to him any further developments.\n\nReturning to the doctor's office, Tryon listened to that genial\ngentleman's comments on the accident, his own concern in which he, by a\ngreat effort, was able to conceal.  The doctor insisted upon his\nreturning to the Hill for supper.  Tryon pleaded illness.  The doctor\nwas solicitous, felt his pulse, examined his tongue, pronounced him\nfeverish, and prescribed a sedative.  Tryon sought refuge in his room\nat the hotel, from which he did not emerge again until morning.\n\nHis emotions were varied and stormy.  At first he could see nothing but\nthe fraud of which he had been made the victim.  A negro girl had been\nfoisted upon him for a white woman, and he had almost committed the\nunpardonable sin against his race of marrying her.  Such a step, he\nfelt, would have been criminal at any time; it would have been the most\nodious treachery at this epoch, when his people had been subjugated and\nhumiliated by the Northern invaders, who had preached negro equality\nand abolished the wholesome laws decreeing the separation of the races.\nBut no Southerner who loved his poor, downtrodden country, or his race,\nthe proud Anglo-Saxon race which traced the clear stream of its blood\nto the cavaliers of England, could tolerate the idea that even in\ndistant generations that unsullied current could be polluted by the\nblood of slaves.  The very thought was an insult to the white people of\nthe South. For Tryon's liberality, of which he had spoken so nobly and\nso sincerely, had been confined unconsciously, and as a matter of\ncourse, within the boundaries of his own race.  The Southern mind, in\ndiscussing abstract questions relative to humanity, makes always,\nconsciously or unconsciously, the mental reservation that the\nconclusions reached do not apply to the negro, unless they can be made\nto harmonize with the customs of the country.\n\nBut reasoning thus was not without effect upon a mind by nature\nreasonable above the average. Tryon's race impulse and social prejudice\nhad carried him too far, and the swing of the mental pendulum brought\nhis thoughts rapidly back in the opposite direction.  Tossing uneasily\non the bed, where he had thrown himself down without undressing, the\nair of the room oppressed him, and he threw open the window.  The cool\nnight air calmed his throbbing pulses.  The moonlight, streaming\nthrough the window, flooded the room with a soft light, in which he\nseemed to see Rena standing before him, as she had appeared that\nafternoon, gazing at him with eyes that implored charity and\nforgiveness.  He burst into tears,--bitter tears, that strained his\nheartstrings.  He was only a youth.  She was his first love, and he had\nlost her forever.  She was worse than dead to him; for if he had seen\nher lying in her shroud before him, he could at least have cherished\nher memory; now, even this consolation was denied him.\n\nThe town clock--which so long as it was wound up regularly recked\nnothing of love or hate, joy or sorrow--solemnly tolled out the hour of\nmidnight and sounded the knell of his lost love.  Lost she was, as\nthough she had never been, as she had indeed had no right to be.  He\nresolutely determined to banish her image from his mind.  See her again\nhe could not; it would be painful to them both; it could be productive\nof no good to either.  He had felt the power and charm of love, and no\nordinary shook could have loosened its hold; but this catastrophe,\nwhich had so rudely swept away the groundwork of his passion, had\nstirred into new life all the slumbering pride of race and ancestry\nwhich characterized his caste. How much of this sensitive superiority\nwas essential and how much accidental; how much of it was due to the\never-suggested comparison with a servile race; how much of it was\nignorance and self-conceit; to what extent the boasted purity of his\nrace would have been contaminated by the fair woman whose image filled\nhis memory,--of these things he never thought.  He was not influenced\nby sordid considerations; he would have denied that his course was\ncontrolled by any narrow prudence.  If Rena had been white, pure white\n(for in his creed there was no compromise), he would have braved any\ndanger for her sake.  Had she been merely of illegitimate birth, he\nwould have overlooked the bar sinister.  Had her people been simply\npoor and of low estate, he would have brushed aside mere worldly\nconsiderations, and would have bravely sacrificed convention for love;\nfor his liberality was not a mere form of words. But the one objection\nwhich he could not overlook was, unhappily, the one that applied to the\nonly woman who had as yet moved his heart.  He tried to be angry with\nher, but after the first hour he found it impossible.  He was a man of\ntoo much imagination not to be able to put himself, in some measure at\nleast, in her place,--to perceive that for her the step which had\nplaced her in Tryon's world was the working out of nature's great law\nof self-preservation, for which he could not blame her. But for the\nsheerest accident,--no, rather, but for a providential\ninterference,--he would have married her, and might have gone to the\ngrave unconscious that she was other than she seemed.\n\nThe clock struck the hour of two.  With a shiver he closed the window,\nundressed by the moonlight, drew down the shade, and went to bed. He\nfell into an unquiet slumber, and dreamed again of Rena.  He must learn\nto control his waking thoughts; his dreams could not be curbed. In that\nrealm Rena's image was for many a day to remain supreme.  He dreamed of\nher sweet smile, her soft touch, her gentle voice.  In all her fair\nyoung beauty she stood before him, and then by some hellish magic she\nwas slowly transformed into a hideous black hag.  With agonized eyes he\nwatched her beautiful tresses become mere wisps of coarse wool, wrapped\nround with dingy cotton strings; he saw her clear eyes grow bloodshot,\nher ivory teeth turn to unwholesome fangs.  With a shudder he awoke, to\nfind the cold gray dawn of a rainy day stealing through the window.\n\nHe rose, dressed himself, went down to breakfast, then entered the\nwriting-room and penned a letter which, after reading it over, he tore\ninto small pieces and threw into the waste basket.  A second shared the\nsame fate.  Giving up the task, he left the hotel and walked down to\nDr. Green's office.\n\n\"Is the doctor in?\" he asked of the colored attendant.\n\n\"No, suh,\" replied the man; \"he's gone ter see de young cullud gal w'at\nfainted w'en de doctah was wid you yistiddy.\"\n\nTryon sat down at the doctor's desk and hastily scrawled a note,\nstating that business compelled his immediate departure.  He thanked\nthe doctor for courtesies extended, and left his regards for the\nladies.  Returning to the hotel, he paid his bill and took a hack for\nthe wharf, from which a boat was due to leave at nine o'clock.\n\nAs the hack drove down Front Street, Tryon noted idly the houses that\nlined the street.  When he reached the sordid district in the lower\npart of the town, there was nothing to attract his attention until the\ncarriage came abreast of a row of cedar-trees, beyond which could be\nseen the upper part of a large house with dormer windows.  Before the\ngate stood a horse and buggy, which Tryon thought he recognized as Dr.\nGreen's.  He leaned forward and addressed the driver.\n\n\"Can you tell me who lives there?\" Tryon asked, pointing to the house.\n\n\"A callud 'oman, suh,\" the man replied, touching his hat.  \"Mis' Molly\nWalden an' her daughter Rena.\"\n\nThe vivid impression he received of this house, and the spectre that\nrose before him of a pale, broken-hearted girl within its gray walls,\nweeping for a lost lover and a vanished dream of happiness, did not\nargue well for Tryon's future peace of mind.  Rena's image was not to\nbe easily expelled from his heart; for the laws of nature are higher\nand more potent than merely human institutions, and upon anything like\na fair field are likely to win in the long ran.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nTWO LETTERS\n\nWarwick awaited events with some calmness and some philosophy,--he\ncould hardly have had the one without the other; and it required much\nphilosophy to make him wait a week in patience for information upon a\nsubject in which he was so vitally interested.  The delay pointed to\ndisaster. Bad news being expected, delay at least put off the evil day.\nAt the end of the week he received two letters,--one addressed in his\nown hand writing and postmarked Patesville, N. C.; the other in the\nhandwriting of George Tryon.  He opened the Patesville letter, which\nran as follows:--\n\n\nMY DEAR SON,--Frank is writing this letter for me.  I am not well, but,\nthank the Lord, I am better than I was.\n\nRena has had a heap of trouble on account of me and my sickness.  If I\ncould of dreamt that I was going to do so much harm, I would of died\nand gone to meet my God without writing one word to spoil my girl's\nchances in life; but I didn't know what was going to happen, and I hope\nthe Lord will forgive me.\n\nFrank knows all about it, and so I am having him write this letter for\nme, as Rena is not well enough yet.  Frank has been very good to me and\nto Rena.  He was down to your place and saw Rena there, and never said\na word about it to nobody, not even to me, because he didn't want to do\nRena no harm.  Frank is the best friend I have got in town, because he\ndoes so much for me and don't want nothing in return.  (He tells me not\nto put this in about him, but I want you to know it.)\n\nAnd now about Rena.  She come to see me, and I got better right away,\nfor it was longing for her as much as anything else that made me sick,\nand I was mighty mizzable.  When she had been here three days and was\ngoing back next day, she went up town to see the doctor for me, and\nwhile she was up there she fainted and fell down in the street, and Dr.\nGreen sent her home in his buggy and come down to see her.  He couldn't\ntell what was the matter with her, but she has been sick ever since and\nout of her head some of the time, and keeps on calling on somebody by\nthe name of George, which was the young white man she told me she was\ngoing to marry.  It seems he was in town the day Rena was took sick,\nfor Frank saw him up street and run all the way down here to tell me,\nso that she could keep out of his way, while she was still up town\nwaiting for the doctor and getting me some camphor gum for my camphor\nbottle.  Old Judge Straight must have knowed something about it, for he\nsent me a note to keep Rena in the house, but the little boy he sent it\nby didn't bring it till Rena was already gone up town, and, as I\ncouldn't read, of course I didn't know what it said.  Dr. Green heard\nRena running on while she was out of her head, and I reckon he must\nhave suspicioned something, for he looked kind of queer and went away\nwithout saying nothing.  Frank says she met this man on the street, and\nwhen he found out she wasn't white, he said or done something that\nbroke her heart and she fainted and fell down.\n\nI am writing you this letter because I know you will be worrying about\nRena not coming back.  If it wasn't for Frank, I hardly know how I\ncould write to you.  Frank is not going to say nothing about Rena's\npassing for white and meeting this man, and neither am I; and I don't\nsuppose Judge Straight will say nothing, because he is our good friend;\nand Dr. Green won't say nothing about it, because Frank says Dr.\nGreen's cook Nancy says this young man named George stopped with him\nand was some cousin or relation to the family, and they wouldn't want\npeople to know that any of their kin was thinking about marrying a\ncolored girl, and the white folks have all been mad since J. B.\nThompson married his black housekeeper when she got religion and\nwouldn't live with him no more.\n\nAll the rest of the connection are well.  I have just been in to see\nhow Rena is.  She is feeling some better, I think, and says give you\nher love and she will write you a letter in a few days, as soon as she\nis well enough.  She bust out crying while she was talking, but I\nreckon that is better than being out of her head.  I hope this may find\nyou well, and that this man of Rena's won't say nor do nothing down\nthere to hurt you.  He has not wrote to Rena nor sent her no word.  I\nreckon he is very mad.\n\n             Your affectionate mother,\n                         MARY WALDEN.\n\n\nThis letter, while confirming Warwick's fears, relieved his suspense.\nHe at least knew the worst, unless there should be something still more\ndisturbing in Tryon's letter, which he now proceeded to open, and which\nran as follows:--\n\n\nJOHN WARWICK, ESQ.\n\nDear Sir,--When I inform you, as you are doubtless informed ere the\nreceipt of this, that I saw your sister in Patesville last week and\nlearned the nature of those antecedents of yours and hers at which you\nhinted so obscurely in a recent conversation, you will not be surprised\nto learn that I take this opportunity of renouncing any pretensions to\nMiss Warwick's hand, and request you to convey this message to her,\nsince it was through you that I formed her acquaintance.  I think\nperhaps that few white men would deem it necessary to make an\nexplanation under the circumstances, and I do not know that I need say\nmore than that no one, considering where and how I met your sister,\nwould have dreamed of even the possibility of what I have learned.  I\nmight with justice reproach you for trifling with the most sacred\nfeelings of a man's heart; but I realize the hardship of your position\nand hers, and can make allowances. I would never have sought to know\nthis thing; I would doubtless have been happier had I gone through life\nwithout finding it out; but having the knowledge, I cannot ignore it,\nas you must understand perfectly well.  I regret that she should be\ndistressed or disappointed,--she has not suffered alone.\n\nI need scarcely assure you that I shall say nothing about this affair,\nand that I shall keep your secret as though it were my own.\nPersonally, I shall never be able to think of you as other than a white\nman, as you may gather from the tone of this letter; and while I cannot\nmarry your sister, I wish her every happiness, and remain,\n\n             Yours very truly,\n                    GEORGE TRYON.\n\n\nWarwick could not know that this formal epistle was the last of a dozen\nthat Tryon had written and destroyed during the week since the meeting\nin Patesville,--hot, blistering letters, cold, cutting letters,\nscornful, crushing letters.  Though none of them was sent, except this\nlast, they had furnished a safety-valve for his emotions, and had left\nhim in a state of mind that permitted him to write the foregoing.\n\nAnd now, while Rena is recovering from her illness, and Tryon from his\nlove, and while Fate is shuffling the cards for another deal, a few\nwords may be said about the past life of the people who lived in the\nrear of the flower garden, in the quaint old house beyond the cedars,\nand how their lives were mingled with those of the men and women around\nthem and others that were gone.  For connected with our kind we must\nbe; if not by our virtues, then by our vices,--if not by our services,\nat least by our needs.\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nUNDER THE OLD REGIME\n\nFor many years before the civil war there had lived, in the old house\nbehind the cedars, a free colored woman who went by the name of Molly\nWalden--her rightful name, for her parents were free-born and legally\nmarried.  She was a tall woman, straight as an arrow.  Her complexion\nin youth was of an old ivory tint, which at the period of this story,\ntime had darkened measurably.  Her black eyes, now faded, had once\nsparkled with the fire of youth.  High cheek-bones, straight black\nhair, and a certain dignified reposefulness of manner pointed to an\naboriginal descent.  Tradition gave her to the negro race.  Doubtless\nshe had a strain of each, with white blood very visibly predominating\nover both.  In Louisiana or the West Indies she would have been called\na quadroon, or more loosely, a creole; in North Carolina, where fine\ndistinctions were not the rule in matters of color, she was\nsufficiently differentiated when described as a bright mulatto.\n\nMolly's free birth carried with it certain advantages, even in the\nSouth before the war.  Though degraded from its high estate, and shorn\nof its choicest attributes, the word \"freedom\" had nevertheless a\ncheerful sound, and described a condition that left even to colored\npeople who could claim it some liberty of movement and some control of\ntheir own persons.  They were not citizens, yet they were not slaves.\nNo negro, save in books, ever refused freedom; many of them ran\nfrightful risks to achieve it.  Molly's parents were of the class, more\nnumerous in North Carolina than elsewhere, known as \"old issue free\nnegroes,\" which took its rise in the misty colonial period, when race\nlines were not so closely drawn, and the population of North Carolina\ncomprised many Indians, runaway negroes, and indentured white servants\nfrom the seaboard plantations, who mingled their blood with great\nfreedom and small formality.  Free colored people in North Carolina\nexercised the right of suffrage as late as 1835, and some of them, in\nspite of galling restrictions, attained to a considerable degree of\nprosperity, and dreamed of a still brighter future, when the growing\ntyranny of the slave power crushed their hopes and crowded the free\npeople back upon the black mass just beneath them.  Mis' Molly's father\nhad been at one time a man of some means.  In an evil hour, with an\noverweening confidence in his fellow men, he indorsed a note for a\nwhite man who, in a moment of financial hardship, clapped his colored\nneighbor on the back and called him brother.  Not poverty, but wealth,\nis the most potent leveler. In due time the indorser was called upon to\nmeet the maturing obligation.  This was the beginning of a series of\nfinancial difficulties which speedily involved him in ruin.  He died\nprematurely, a disappointed and disheartened man, leaving his family in\ndire poverty.\n\nHis widow and surviving children lived on for a little while at the\nhouse he had owned, just outside of the town, on one of the main\ntraveled roads. By the wayside, near the house, there was a famous deep\nwell.  The slim, barefoot girl, with sparkling eyes and voluminous\nhair, who played about the yard and sometimes handed water in a gourd\nto travelers, did not long escape critical observation. A gentleman\ndrove by one day, stopped at the well, smiled upon the girl, and said\nkind words.  He came again, more than once, and soon, while scarcely\nmore than a child in years, Molly was living in her own house, hers by\ndeed of gift, for her protector was rich and liberal.  Her mother\nnevermore knew want.  Her poor relations could always find a meal in\nMolly's kitchen.  She did not flaunt her prosperity in the world's\nface; she hid it discreetly behind the cedar screen.  Those who wished\ncould know of it, for there were few secrets in Patesville; those who\nchose could as easily ignore it.  There were few to trouble themselves\nabout the secluded life of an obscure woman of a class which had no\nrecognized place in the social economy.  She worshiped the ground upon\nwhich her lord walked, was humbly grateful for his protection, and\nquite as faithful as the forbidden marriage vow could possibly have\nmade her.  She led her life in material peace and comfort, and with a\ncertain amount of dignity.  Of her false relation to society she was\nnot without some vague conception; but the moral point involved was so\nconfused with other questions growing out--of slavery and caste as to\ncause her, as a rule, but little uneasiness; and only now and then, in\nthe moments of deeper feeling that come sometimes to all who live and\nlove, did there break through the mists of ignorance and prejudice\nsurrounding her a flash of light by which she saw, so far as she was\ncapable of seeing, her true position, which in the clear light of truth\nno special pleading could entirely justify.  For she was free, she had\nnot the slave's excuse.  With every inducement to do evil and few\nincentives to do well, and hence entitled to charitable judgment, she\nyet had freedom of choice, and therefore could not wholly escape blame.\nLet it be said, in further extenuation, that no other woman lived in\nneglect or sorrow because of her.  She robbed no one else.  For what\nlife gave her she returned an equivalent; and what she did not pay, her\nchildren settled to the last farthing.\n\nSeveral years before the war, when Mis' Molly's daughter Rena was a few\nyears old, death had suddenly removed the source of their prosperity.\n\nThe household was not left entirely destitute. Mis' Molly owned her\nhome, and had a store of gold pieces in the chest beneath her bed.  A\nsmall piece of real estate stood in the name of each of the children,\nthe income from which contributed to their maintenance.  Larger\nexpectations were dependent upon the discovery of a promised will,\nwhich never came to light.  Mis' Molly wore black for several years\nafter this bereavement, until the teacher and the preacher, following\nclose upon the heels of military occupation, suggested to the colored\npeople new standards of life and character, in the light of which Mis'\nMolly laid her mourning sadly and shamefacedly aside.  She had eaten of\nthe fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.  After the war she formed the habit\nof church-going, and might have been seen now and then, with her\ndaughter, in a retired corner of the gallery of the white Episcopal\nchurch.  Upon the ground floor was a certain pew which could be seen\nfrom her seat, where once had sat a gentleman whose pleasures had not\ninterfered with the practice of his religion.  She might have had a\nbetter seat in a church where a Northern missionary would have preached\na sermon better suited to her comprehension and her moral needs, but\nshe preferred the other.  She was not white, alas! she was shut out\nfrom this seeming paradise; but she liked to see the distant glow of\nthe celestial city, and to recall the days when she had basked in its\nradiance.  She did not sympathize greatly with the new era opened up\nfor the emancipated slaves; she had no ideal love of liberty; she was\nno broader and no more altruistic than the white people around her, to\nwhom she had always looked up; and she sighed for the old days, because\nto her they had been the good days.  Now, not only was her king dead,\nbut the shield of his memory protected her no longer.\n\nMolly had lost one child, and his grave was visible from the kitchen\nwindow, under a small clump of cedars in the rear of the two-acre lot.\nFor even in the towns many a household had its private cemetery in\nthose old days when the living were close to the dead, and ghosts were\nnot the mere chimeras of a sick imagination, but real though\nunsubstantial entities, of which it was almost disgraceful not to have\nseen one or two. Had not the Witch of Endor called up the shade of\nSamuel the prophet?  Had not the spirit of Mis' Molly's dead son\nappeared to her, as well as the ghostly presence of another she had\nloved?\n\nIn 1855, Mis' Molly's remaining son had grown into a tall, slender lad\nof fifteen, with his father's patrician features and his mother's\nIndian hair, and no external sign to mark him off from the white boys\non the street.  He soon came to know, however, that there was a\ndifference.  He was informed one day that he was black.  He denied the\nproposition and thrashed the child who made it. The scene was repeated\nthe next day, with a variation,--he was himself thrashed by a larger\nboy. When he had been beaten five or six times, he ceased to argue the\npoint, though to himself he never admitted the charge.  His playmates\nmight call him black; the mirror proved that God, the Father of all,\nhad made him white; and God, he had been taught, made no\nmistakes,--having made him white, He must have meant him to be white.\n\nIn the \"hall\" or parlor of his mother's house stood a quaintly carved\nblack walnut bookcase, containing a small but remarkable collection of\nbooks, which had at one time been used, in his hours of retreat and\nrelaxation from business and politics, by the distinguished gentleman\nwho did not give his name to Mis' Molly's children,--to whom it would\nhave been a valuable heritage, could they have had the right to bear\nit.  Among the books were a volume of Fielding's complete works, in\nfine print, set in double columns; a set of Bulwer's novels; a\ncollection of everything that Walter Scott--the literary idol of the\nSouth--had ever written; Beaumont and Fletcher's plays, cheek by jowl\nwith the history of the virtuous Clarissa Harlowe; the Spectator and\nTristram Shandy, Robinson Crusoe and the Arabian Nights.  On these\nsecluded shelves Roderick Random, Don Quixote, and Gil Blas for a long\ntime ceased their wanderings, the Pilgrim's Progress was suspended,\nMilton's mighty harmonies were dumb, and Shakespeare reigned over a\nsilent kingdom.  An illustrated Bible, with a wonderful Apocrypha, was\nflanked on one side by Volney's Ruins of Empire and on the other by\nPaine's Age of Reason, for the collector of the books had been a man of\ncatholic taste as well as of inquiring mind, and no one who could have\ncriticised his reading ever penetrated behind the cedar hedge.  A\nhistory of the French Revolution consorted amiably with a homespun\nchronicle of North Carolina, rich in biographical notices of\ndistinguished citizens and inscriptions from their tombstones, upon\nreading which one might well wonder why North Carolina had not long ago\neclipsed the rest of the world in wealth, wisdom, glory, and renown.\nOn almost every page of this monumental work could be found the most\nardent panegyrics of liberty, side by side with the slavery statistics\nof the State,--an incongruity of which the learned author was\ndeliciously unconscious.\n\nWhen John Walden was yet a small boy, he had learned all that could be\ntaught by the faded mulatto teacher in the long, shiny black frock\ncoat, whom local public opinion permitted to teach a handful of free\ncolored children for a pittance barely enough to keep soul and body\ntogether. When the boy had learned to read, he discovered the library,\nwhich for several years had been without a reader, and found in it the\nportal of a new world, peopled with strange and marvelous beings. Lying\nprone upon the floor of the shaded front piazza, behind the fragrant\ngarden, he followed the fortunes of Tom Jones and Sophia; he wept over\nthe fate of Eugene Aram; he penetrated with Richard the Lion-heart into\nSaladin's tent, with Gil Blas into the robbers' cave; he flew through\nthe air on the magic carpet or the enchanted horse, or tied with\nSindbad to the roc's leg.  Sometimes he read or repeated the simpler\nstories to his little sister, sitting wide-eyed by his side.  When he\nhad read all the books,--indeed, long before he had read them all,--he\ntoo had tasted of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: contentment took\nits flight, and happiness lay far beyond the sphere where he was born.\nThe blood of his white fathers, the heirs of the ages, cried out for\nits own, and after the manner of that blood set about getting the\nobject of its desire.\n\nNear the corner of Mackenzie Street, just one block north of the\nPatesville market-house, there had stood for many years before the war,\non the verge of the steep bank of Beaver Creek, a small frame office\nbuilding, the front of which was level with the street, while the rear\nrested on long brick pillars founded on the solid rock at the edge of\nthe brawling stream below.  Here, for nearly half a century, Archibald\nStraight had transacted legal business for the best people of\nNorthumberland County.  Full many a lawsuit had he won, lost, or\nsettled; many a spendthrift had he saved from ruin, and not a few\nfamilies from disgrace.  Several times honored by election to the\nbench, he had so dispensed justice tempered with mercy as to win the\nhearts of all good citizens, and especially those of the poor, the\noppressed, and the socially disinherited.  The rights of the humblest\nnegro, few as they might be, were as sacred to him as those of the\nproudest aristocrat, and he had sentenced a man to be hanged for the\nmurder of his own slave.  An old-fashioned man, tall and spare of\nfigure and bowed somewhat with age, he was always correctly clad in a\nlong frock coat of broadcloth, with a high collar and a black stock.\nCourtly in address to his social equals (superiors he had none), he was\nkind and considerate to those beneath him.  He owned a few domestic\nservants, no one of whom had ever felt the weight of his hand, and for\nwhose ultimate freedom he had provided in his will.  In the\nlong-drawn-out slavery agitation he had taken a keen interest, rather\nas observer than as participant.  As the heat of controversy increased,\nhis lack of zeal for the peculiar institution led to his defeat for the\nbench by a more active partisan.  His was too just a mind not to\nperceive the arguments on both sides; but, on the whole, he had stood\nby the ancient landmarks, content to let events drift to a conclusion\nhe did not expect to see; the institutions of his fathers would\nprobably last his lifetime.\n\nOne day Judge Straight was sitting in his office reading a recently\npublished pamphlet,--presenting an elaborate pro-slavery argument,\nbased upon the hopeless intellectual inferiority of the negro, and the\nphysical and moral degeneration of mulattoes, who combined the worst\nqualities of their two ancestral races,--when a barefooted boy walked\ninto the office, straw hat in hand, came boldly up to the desk at which\nthe old judge was sitting, and said as the judge looked up through his\ngold-rimmed glasses,--\n\n\"Sir, I want to be a lawyer!\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" exclaimed the judge.  \"It is a singular desire, from a\nsingular source, and expressed in a singular way.  Who the devil are\nyou, sir, that wish so strange a thing as to become a\nlawyer--everybody's servant?\"\n\n\"And everybody's master, sir,\" replied the lad stoutly.\n\n\"That is a matter of opinion, and open to argument,\" rejoined the\njudge, amused and secretly flattered by this tribute to his profession,\n\"though there may be a grain of truth in what you say. But what is your\nname, Mr. Would-be-lawyer?\"\n\n\"John Walden, sir,\" answered the lad.\n\n\"John Walden?--Walden?\" mused the judge. \"What Walden can that be?  Do\nyou belong in town?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Humph!  I can't imagine who you are.  It's plain that you are a lad of\ngood blood, and yet I don't know whose son you can be.  What is your\nfather's name?\"\n\nThe lad hesitated, and flushed crimson.\n\nThe old gentleman noted his hesitation.  \"It is a wise son,\" he\nthought, \"that knows his own father.  He is a bright lad, and will have\nthis question put to him more than once.  I'll see how he will answer\nit.\"\n\nThe boy maintained an awkward silence, while the old judge eyed him\nkeenly.\n\n\"My father's dead,\" he said at length, in a low voice.  \"I'm Mis' Molly\nWalden's son.\"  He had expected, of course, to tell who he was, if\nasked, but had not foreseen just the form of the inquiry; and while he\nhad thought more of his race than of his illegitimate birth, he\nrealized at this moment as never before that this question too would be\nalways with him.  As put now by Judge Straight, it made him wince.  He\nhad not read his father's books for nothing.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" exclaimed the judge in genuine surprise at this\nanswer; \"and you want to be a lawyer!\"  The situation was so much worse\nthan he had suspected that even an old practitioner, case-hardened by\nyears of life at the trial table and on the bench, was startled for a\nmoment into a comical sort of consternation, so apparent that a lad\nless stout-hearted would have weakened and fled at the sight of it.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Why not?\" responded the boy, trembling a little at the\nknees, but stoutly holding his ground.\n\n\"He wants to be a lawyer, and he asks me why not!\" muttered the judge,\nspeaking apparently to himself.  He rose from his chair, walked across\nthe room, and threw open a window.  The cool morning air brought with\nit the babbling of the stream below and the murmur of the mill near by.\nHe glanced across the creek to the ruined foundation of an old house on\nthe low ground beyond the creek.  Turning from the window, he looked\nback at the boy, who had remained standing between him and the door.\nAt that moment another lad came along the street and stopped opposite\nthe open doorway.  The presence of the two boys in connection with the\nbook he had been reading suggested a comparison.  The judge knew the\nlad outside as the son of a leading merchant of the town.  The merchant\nand his wife were both of old families which had lived in the community\nfor several generations, and whose blood was presumably of the purest\nstrain; yet the boy was sallow, with amorphous features, thin shanks,\nand stooping shoulders.  The youth standing in the judge's office, on\nthe contrary, was straight, shapely, and well-grown.  His eye was\nclear, and he kept it fixed on the old gentleman with a look in which\nthere was nothing of cringing.  He was no darker than many a white boy\nbronzed by the Southern sun; his hair and eyes were black, and his\nfeatures of the high-bred, clean-cut order that marks the patrician\ntype the world over.  What struck the judge most forcibly, however, was\nthe lad's resemblance to an old friend and companion and client.  He\nrecalled a certain conversation with this old friend, who had said to\nhim one day:\n\n\"Archie, I'm coming in to have you draw my will.  There are some\nchildren for whom I would like to make ample provision.  I can't give\nthem anything else, but money will make them free of the world.\"\n\nThe judge's friend had died suddenly before carrying out this good\nintention.  The judge had taken occasion to suggest the existence of\nthese children, and their father's intentions concerning them, to the\ndistant relatives who had inherited his friend's large estate.  They\nhad chosen to take offense at the suggestion.  One had thought it in\nshocking bad taste; another considered any mention of such a subject an\ninsult to his cousin's memory.  A third had said, with flashing eyes,\nthat the woman and her children had already robbed the estate of\nenough; that it was a pity the little niggers were not slaves--that\nthey would have added measurably to the value of the property. Judge\nStraight's manner indicated some disapproval of their attitude, and the\nsettlement of the estate was placed in other hands than his.  Now, this\nson, with his father's face and his father's voice, stood before his\nfather's friend, demanding entrance to the golden gate of opportunity,\nwhich society barred to all who bore the blood of the despised race.\n\nAs he kept on looking at the boy, who began at length to grow somewhat\nembarrassed under this keen scrutiny, the judge's mind reverted to\ncertain laws and judicial decisions that he had looked up once or twice\nin his lifetime.  Even the law, the instrument by which tyranny riveted\nthe chains upon its victims, had revolted now and then against the\nsenseless and unnatural prejudice by which a race ascribing its\nsuperiority to right of blood permitted a mere suspicion of servile\nblood to outweigh a vast preponderance of its own.\n\n\"Why, indeed, should he not be a lawyer, or anything else that a man\nmight be, if it be in him?\" asked the judge, speaking rather to himself\nthan to the boy.  \"Sit down,\" he ordered, pointing to a chair on the\nother side of the room.  That he should ask a colored lad to be seated\nin his presence was of itself enough to stamp the judge as eccentric.\n\"You want to be a lawyer,\" he went on, adjusting his spectacles.  \"You\nare aware, of course, that you are a negro?\"\n\n\"I am white,\" replied the lad, turning back his sleeve and holding out\nhis arm, \"and I am free, as all my people were before me.\"\n\nThe old lawyer shook his head, and fixed his eyes upon the lad with a\nslightly quizzical smile.  \"You are black.\"  he said, \"and you are not\nfree.  You cannot travel without your papers; you cannot secure\naccommodations at an inn; you could not vote, if you were of age; you\ncannot be out after nine o'clock without a permit.  If a white man\nstruck you, you could not return the blow, and you could not testify\nagainst him in a court of justice. You are black, my lad, and you are\nnot free.  Did you ever hear of the Dred Scott decision, delivered by\nthe great, wise, and learned Judge Taney?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered the boy.\n\n\"It is too long to read,\" rejoined the judge, taking up the pamphlet he\nhad laid down upon the lad's entrance, \"but it says in substance, as\nquoted by this author, that negroes are beings 'of an inferior order,\nand altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social\nor political relations; in fact, so inferior that they have no rights\nwhich the white man is bound to respect, and that the negro may justly\nand lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.'  That is the law\nof this nation, and that is the reason why you cannot be a lawyer.\"\n\n\"It may all be true,\" replied the boy, \"but it don't apply to me.  It\nsays 'the negro.'  A negro is black; I am white, and not black.\"\n\n\"Black as ink, my lad,\" returned the lawyer, shaking his head.  \"'One\ntouch of nature makes the whole world kin,' says the poet.  Somewhere,\nsometime, you had a black ancestor.  One drop of black blood makes the\nwhole man black.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't it be the other way, if the white blood is so much\nsuperior?\" inquired the lad.\n\n\"Because it is more convenient as it is--and more profitable.\"\n\n\"It is not right,\" maintained the lad.\n\n\"God bless me!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, \"he is invading the field\nof ethics!  He will be questioning the righteousness of slavery next!\nI'm afraid you wouldn't make a good lawyer, in any event.  Lawyers go\nby the laws--they abide by the accomplished fact; to them, whatever is,\nis right. The laws do not permit men of color to practice law, and\npublic sentiment would not allow one of them to study it.\"\n\n\"I had thought,\" said the lad, \"that I might pass for white.  There are\nwhite people darker than I am.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, that is another matter; but\"--\n\nThe judge stopped for a moment, struck by the absurdity of his arguing\nsuch a question with a mulatto boy.  He really must be falling into\npremature dotage.  The proper thing would be to rebuke the lad for his\npresumption and advise him to learn to take care of horses, or make\nboots, or lay bricks.  But again he saw his old friend in the lad's\nface, and again he looked in vain for any sign of negro blood.  The\nleast earmark would have turned the scale, but he could not find it.\n\n\"That is another matter,\" he repeated.  \"Here you have started as\nblack, and must remain so. But if you wish to move away, and sink your\npast into oblivion, the case might be different.  Let us see what the\nlaw is; you might not need it if you went far enough, but it is well\nenough to be within it--liberty is sweeter when founded securely on the\nlaw.\"\n\nHe took down a volume bound in legal calf and glanced through it.  \"The\ncolor line is drawn in North Carolina at four generations removed from\nthe negro; there have been judicial decisions to that effect.  I\nimagine that would cover your case.  But let us see what South Carolina\nmay say about it,\" he continued, taking another book. \"I think the law\nis even more liberal there.  Ah, this is the place:--\n\n\"'The term mulatto,'\" he read, \"'is not invariably applicable to every\nadmixture of African blood with the European, nor is one having all the\nfeatures of a white to be ranked with the degraded class designated by\nthe laws of this State as persons of color, because of some remote\ntaint of the negro race.  Juries would probably be justified in holding\na person to be white in whom the admixture of African blood did not\nexceed one eighth.  And even where color or feature are doubtful, it is\na question for the jury to decide by reputation, by reception into\nsociety, and by their exercise of the privileges of the white man, as\nwell as by admixture of blood.'\"\n\n\"Then I need not be black?\" the boy cried, with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"No,\" replied the lawyer, \"you need not be black, away from Patesville.\nYou have the somewhat unusual privilege, it seems, of choosing between\ntwo races, and if you are a lad of spirit, as I think you are, it will\nnot take you long to make your choice.  As you have all the features of\na white man, you would, at least in South Carolina, have simply to\nassume the place and exercise the privileges of a white man.  You\nmight, of course, do the same thing anywhere, as long as no one knew\nyour origin.  But the matter has been adjudicated there in several\ncases, and on the whole I think South Carolina is the place for you.\nThey're more liberal there, perhaps because they have many more blacks\nthan whites, and would like to lessen the disproportion.\"\n\n\"From this time on,\" said the boy, \"I am white.\"\n\n\"Softly, softly, my Caucasian fellow citizen,\" returned the judge,\nchuckling with quiet amusement.  \"You are white in the abstract, before\nthe law.  You may cherish the fact in secret, but I would not advise\nyou to proclaim it openly just yet.  You must wait until you go\naway--to South Carolina.\"\n\n\"And can I learn to be a lawyer, sir?\" asked the lad.\n\n\"It seems to me that you ought to be reasonably content for one day\nwith what you have learned already.  You cannot be a lawyer until you\nare white, in position as well as in theory, nor until you are\ntwenty-one years old.  I need an office boy.  If you are willing to\ncome into my office, sweep it, keep my books dusted, and stay here when\nI am out, I do not care.  To the rest of the town you will be my\nservant, and still a negro.  If you choose to read my books when no one\nis about and be white in your own private opinion, I have no objection.\nWhen you have made up your mind to go away, perhaps what you have read\nmay help you.  But mum 's the word! If I hear a whisper of this from\nany other source, out you go, neck and crop!  I am willing to help you\nmake a man of yourself, but it can only be done under the rose.\"\n\nFor two years John Walden openly swept the office and surreptitiously\nread the law books of old Judge Straight.  When he was eighteen, he\nasked his mother for a sum of money, kissed her good-by, and went out\ninto the world.  When his sister, then a pretty child of seven, cried\nbecause her big brother was going away, he took her up in his arms,\ngave her a silver dime with a hole in it for a keepsake, hugged her\nclose, and kissed her.\n\n\"Nev' min', sis,\" he said soothingly.  \"Be a good little gal, an' some\no' these days I'll come back to see you and bring you somethin' fine.\"\n\nIn after years, when Mis' Molly was asked what had become of her son,\nshe would reply with sad complacency,--\n\n\"He's gone over on the other side.\"\n\nAs we have seen, he came back ten years later.\n\n\nMany years before, when Mis' Molly, then a very young woman, had taken\nup her residence in the house behind the cedars, the gentleman\nheretofore referred to had built a cabin on the opposite corner, in\nwhich he had installed a trusted slave by the name of Peter Fowler and\nhis wife Nancy. Peter was a good mechanic, and hired his time from his\nmaster with the provision that Peter and his wife should do certain\nwork for Mis' Molly and serve as a sort of protection for her.  In\ncourse of time Peter, who was industrious and thrifty, saved enough\nmoney to purchase his freedom and that of his wife and their one child,\nand to buy the little house across the street, with the cooper shop\nbehind it.  After they had acquired their freedom, Peter and Nancy did\nno work for Mis' Molly save as they were paid for it, and as a rule\npreferred not to work at all for the woman who had been practically\ntheir mistress; it made them seem less free.  Nevertheless, the two\nhouseholds had remained upon good terms, even after the death of the\nman whose will had brought them together, and who had remained Peter's\npatron after he had ceased to be his master.  There was no intimate\nassociation between the two families.  Mis' Molly felt herself\ninfinitely superior to Peter and his wife,--scarcely less superior than\nher poor white neighbors felt themselves to Mis' Molly.  Mis' Molly\nalways meant to be kind, and treated Peter and Nancy with a certain\ngood-natured condescension. They resented this, never openly or\noffensively, but always in a subconscious sort of way, even when they\ndid not speak of it among themselves--much as they had resented her\nmistress-ship in the old days.  For after all, they argued, in spite of\nher airs and graces, her white face and her fine clothes, was she not a\nnegro, even as themselves? and since the slaves had been freed, was not\none negro as good as another?\n\nPeter's son Frank had grown up with little Rena.  He was several years\nolder than she, and when Rena was a small child Mis' Molly had often\nconfided her to his care, and he had watched over her and kept her from\nharm.  When Frank became old enough to go to work in the cooper shop,\nRena, then six or seven, had often gone across to play among the clean\nwhite shavings.  Once Frank, while learning the trade, had let slip a\nsharp steel tool, which flying toward Rena had grazed her arm and sent\nthe red blood coursing along the white flesh and soaking the muslin\nsleeve.  He had rolled up the sleeve and stanched the blood and dried\nher tears.  For a long time thereafter her mother kept her away from\nthe shop and was very cold to Frank.  One day the little girl wandered\ndown to the bank of the old canal.  It had been raining for several\ndays, and the water was quite deep in the channel.  The child slipped\nand fell into the stream.  From the open window of the cooper shop\nFrank heard a scream.  He ran down to the canal and pulled her out, and\ncarried her all wet and dripping to the house.  From that time he had\nbeen restored to favor.  He had watched the girl grow up to womanhood\nin the years following the war, and had been sorry when she became too\nold to play about the shop.\n\nHe never spoke to her of love,--indeed, he never thought of his passion\nin such a light. There would have been no legal barrier to their union;\nthere would have been no frightful menace to white supremacy in the\nmarriage of the negro and the octoroon: the drop of dark blood bridged\nthe chasm.  But Frank knew that she did not love him, and had not hoped\nthat she might.  His was one of those rare souls that can give with\nsmall hope of return.  When he had made the scar upon her arm, by the\nsame token she had branded him her slave forever; when he had saved her\nfrom a watery grave, he had given his life to her.  There are depths of\nfidelity and devotion in the negro heart that have never been fathomed\nor fully appreciated.  Now and then in the kindlier phases of slavery\nthese qualities were brightly conspicuous, and in them, if wisely\nappealed to, lies the strongest hope of amity between the two races\nwhose destiny seems bound up together in the Western world.  Even a\ndumb brute can be won by kindness.  Surely it were worth while to try\nsome other weapon than scorn and contumely and hard words upon people\nof our common race,--the human race, which is bigger and broader than\nCelt or Saxon, barbarian or Greek, Jew or Gentile, black or white; for\nwe are all children of a common Father, forget it as we may, and each\none of us is in some measure his brother's keeper.\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nGOD MADE US ALL\n\nRena was convalescent from a two-weeks' illness when her brother came\nto see her.  He arrived at Patesville by an early morning train before\nthe town was awake, and walked unnoticed from the station to his\nmother's house.  His meeting with his sister was not without emotion:\nhe embraced her tenderly, and Rena became for a few minutes a very\nNiobe of grief.\n\n\"Oh, it was cruel, cruel!\" she sobbed.  \"I shall never get over it.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear,\" replied Warwick soothingly,--\"I know it, and I'm\nto blame for it.  If I had never taken you away from here, you would\nhave escaped this painful experience.  But do not despair; all is not\nlost.  Tryon will not marry you, as I hoped he might, while I feared\nthe contrary; but he is a gentleman, and will be silent. Come back and\ntry again.\"\n\n\"No, John.  I couldn't go through it a second time.  I managed very\nwell before, when I thought our secret was unknown; but now I could\nnever be sure.  It would be borne on every wind, for aught I knew, and\nevery rustling leaf might whisper it.  The law, you said, made us\nwhite; but not the law, nor even love, can conquer prejudice.  HE spoke\nof my beauty, my grace, my sweetness!  I looked into his eyes and\nbelieved him.  And yet he left me without a word!  What would I do in\nClarence now?  I came away engaged to be married, with even the day\nset; I should go back forsaken and discredited; even the servants would\npity me.\"\n\n\"Little Albert is pining for you,\" suggested Warwick.  \"We could make\nsome explanation that would spare your feelings.\"\n\n\"Ah, do not tempt me, John!  I love the child, and am grieved to leave\nhim.  I'm grateful, too, John, for what you have done for me.  I am not\nsorry that I tried it.  It opened my eyes, and I would rather die of\nknowledge than live in ignorance. But I could not go through it again,\nJohn; I am not strong enough.  I could do you no good; I have made you\ntrouble enough already.  Get a mother for Albert--Mrs. Newberry would\nmarry you, secret and all, and would be good to the child. Forget me,\nJohn, and take care of yourself.  Your friend has found you out through\nme--he may have told a dozen people.  You think he will be silent;--I\nthought he loved me, and he left me without a word, and with a look\nthat told me how he hated and despised me.  I would not have believed\nit--even of a white man.\"\n\n\"You do him an injustice,\" said her brother, producing Tryon's letter.\n\"He did not get off unscathed.  He sent you a message.\"\n\nShe turned her face away, but listened while he read the letter. \"He\ndid not love me,\" she cried angrily, when he had finished, \"or he would\nnot have cast me off--he would not have looked at me so.  The law would\nhave let him marry me.  I seemed as white as he did.  He might have\ngone anywhere with me, and no one would have stared at us curiously; no\none need have known.  The world is wide--there must be some place where\na man could live happily with the woman he loved.\"\n\n\"Yes, Rena, there is; and the world is wide enough for you to get along\nwithout Tryon.\"\n\n\"For a day or two,\" she went on, \"I hoped he might come back.  But his\nexpression in that awful moment grew upon me, haunted me day and night,\nuntil I shuddered at the thought that I might ever see him again.  He\nlooked at me as though I were not even a human being.  I do not love\nhim any longer, John; I would not marry him if I were white, or he were\nas I am.  He did not love me--or he would have acted differently.  He\nmight have loved me and have left me--he could not have loved me and\nhave looked at me so!\"\n\nShe was weeping hysterically.  There was little he could say to comfort\nher.  Presently she dried her tears.  Warwick was reluctant to leave\nher in Patesville.  Her childish happiness had been that of ignorance;\nshe could never be happy there again. She had flowered in the sunlight;\nshe must not pine away in the shade.\n\n\"If you won't come back with me, Rena, I'll send you to some school at\nthe North, where you can acquire a liberal education, and prepare\nyourself for some career of usefulness.  You may marry a better man\nthan even Tryon.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied firmly, \"I shall never marry any man, and I'll not\nleave mother again.  God is against it; I'll stay with my own people.\"\n\n\"God has nothing to do with it,\" retorted Warwick.  \"God is too often a\nconvenient stalking-horse for human selfishness.  If there is anything\nto be done, so unjust, so despicable, so wicked that human reason\nrevolts at it, there is always some smug hypocrite to exclaim, 'It is\nthe will of God.'\"\n\n\"God made us all,\" continued Rena dreamily, \"and for some good purpose,\nthough we may not always see it.  He made some people white, and\nstrong, and masterful, and--heartless.  He made others black and\nhomely, and poor and weak\"--\n\n\"And a lot of others 'poor white' and shiftless,\" smiled Warwick.\n\n\"He made us, too,\" continued Rena, intent upon her own thought, \"and He\nmust have had a reason for it.  Perhaps He meant us to bring the others\ntogether in his own good time.  A man may make a new place for\nhimself--a woman is born and bound to hers.  God must have meant me to\nstay here, or He would not have sent me back.  I shall accept things as\nthey are.  Why should I seek the society of people whose\nfriendship--and love--one little word can turn to scorn?  I was right,\nJohn; I ought to have told him.  Suppose he had married me and then had\nfound it out?\"\n\nTo Rena's argument of divine foreordination Warwick attached no weight\nwhatever.  He had seen God's heel planted for four long years upon the\nland which had nourished slavery.  Had God ordained the crime that the\npunishment might follow?  It would have been easier for Omnipotence to\nprevent the crime.  The experience of his sister had stirred up a\ncertain bitterness against white people--a feeling which he had put\naside years ago, with his dark blood, but which sprang anew into life\nwhen the fact of his own origin was brought home to him so forcibly\nthrough his sister's misfortune.  His sworn friend and promised\nbrother-in-law had thrown him over promptly, upon the discovery of the\nhidden drop of dark blood.  How many others of his friends would do the\nsame, if they but knew of it?  He had begun to feel a little of the\nspiritual estrangement from his associates that he had noticed in Rena\nduring her life at Clarence. The fact that several persons knew his\nsecret had spoiled the fine flavor of perfect security hitherto marking\nhis position.  George Tryon was a man of honor among white men, and had\ndeigned to extend the protection of his honor to Warwick as a man,\nthough no longer as a friend; to Rena as a woman, but not as a wife.\nTryon, however, was only human, and who could tell when their paths in\nlife might cross again, or what future temptation Tryon might feel to\nuse a damaging secret to their disadvantage? Warwick had cherished\ncertain ambitions, but these he must now put behind him.  In the\nobscurity of private life, his past would be of little moment; in the\nglare of a political career, one's antecedents are public property, and\ntoo great a reserve in regard to one's past is regarded as a confession\nof something discreditable.  Frank, too, knew the secret--a good,\nfaithful fellow, even where there was no obligation of fidelity; he\nought to do something for Frank to show their appreciation of his\nconduct. But what assurance was there that Frank would always be\ndiscreet about the affairs of others? Judge Straight knew the whole\nstory, and old men are sometimes garrulous.  Dr. Green suspected the\nsecret; he had a wife and daughters.  If old Judge Straight could have\nknown Warwick's thoughts, he would have realized the fulfillment of his\nprophecy. Warwick, who had builded so well for himself, had weakened\nthe structure of his own life by trying to share his good fortune with\nhis sister.\n\n\"Listen, Rena,\" he said, with a sudden impulse, \"we'll go to the North\nor West--I'll go with you--far away from the South and the Southern\npeople, and start life over again.  It will be easier for you, it will\nnot be hard for me--I am young, and have means.  There are no strong\nties to bind me to the South.  I would have a larger outlook elsewhere.\"\n\n\"And what about our mother?\" asked Rena.\n\nIt would be necessary to leave her behind, they both perceived clearly\nenough, unless they were prepared to surrender the advantage of their\nwhiteness and drop back to the lower rank.  The mother bore the mark of\nthe Ethiopian--not pronouncedly, but distinctly; neither would Mis'\nMolly, in all probability, care to leave home and friends and the\ngraves of her loved ones.  She had no mental resources to supply the\nplace of these; she was, moreover, too old to be transplanted; she\nwould not fit into Warwick's scheme for a new life.\n\n\"I left her once,\" said Rena, \"and it brought pain and sorrow to all\nthree of us.  She is not strong, and I will not leave her here to die\nalone. This shall be my home while she lives, and if I leave it again,\nit shall be for only a short time, to go where I can write to her\nfreely, and hear from her often.  Don't worry about me, John,--I shall\ndo very well.\"\n\nWarwick sighed.  He was sincerely sorry to leave his sister, and yet he\nsaw that for the time being her resolution was not to be shaken.  He\nmust bide his time.  Perhaps, in a few months, she would tire of the\nold life.  His door would be always open to her, and he would charge\nhimself with her future.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, concluding the argument, \"we'll say no more\nabout it for the present.  I'll write to you later.  I was afraid that\nyou might not care to go back just now, and so I brought your trunk\nalong with me.\"\n\nHe gave his mother the baggage-check.  She took it across to Frank,\nwho, during the day, brought the trunk from the depot.  Mis' Molly\noffered to pay him for the service, but he would accept nothing.\n\n\"Lawd, no, Mis' Molly; I did n' hafter go out'n my way ter git dat\ntrunk.  I had a load er sperrit-bairls ter haul ter de still, an' de\ndepot wuz right on my way back.  It'd be robbin' you ter take pay fer a\nlittle thing lack dat.\"\n\n\"My son John's here,\" said Mis' Molly \"an' he wants to see you.  Come\ninto the settin'-room. We don't want folks to know he's in town; but\nyou know all our secrets, an' we can trust you like one er the family.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to see you again, Frank,\" said Warwick, extending his hand\nand clasping Frank's warmly.  \"You've grown up since I saw you last,\nbut it seems you are still our good friend.\"\n\n\"Our very good friend,\" interjected Rena.\n\nFrank threw her a grateful glance.  \"Yas, suh,\" he said, looking\nWarwick over with a friendly eye, \"an' you is growed some, too.  I seed\nyou, you know, down dere where you live; but I did n' let on, fer you\nan' Mis' Rena wuz w'ite as anybody; an' eve'ybody said you wuz good ter\ncullud folks, an' he'ped 'em in deir lawsuits an' one way er 'nuther,\nan' I wuz jes' plum' glad ter see you gettin' 'long so fine, dat I wuz,\ncertain sho', an' no mistake about it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Frank, and I want you to understand how much I appreciate\"--\n\n\"How much we all appreciate,\" corrected Rena.\n\n\"Yes, how much we all appreciate, and how grateful we all are for your\nkindness to mother for so many years.  I know from her and from my\nsister how good you've been to them.\"\n\n\"Lawd, suh!\" returned Frank deprecatingly, \"you're makin' a mountain\nout'n a molehill.  I ain't done nuthin' ter speak of--not half ez much\nez I would 'a' done.  I wuz glad ter do w'at little I could, fer\nfrien'ship's sake.\"\n\n\"We value your friendship, Frank, and we'll not forget it.\"\n\n\"No, Frank,\" added Rena, \"we will never forget it, and you shall always\nbe our good friend.\"\n\nFrank left the room and crossed the street with swelling heart.  He\nwould have given his life for Rena.  A kind word was doubly sweet from\nher lips; no service would be too great to pay for her friendship.\n\n\nWhen Frank went out to the stable next morning to feed his mule, his\neyes opened wide with astonishment.  In place of the decrepit, one-eyed\narmy mule he had put up the night before, a fat, sleek specimen of\nvigorous mulehood greeted his arrival with the sonorous hehaw of lusty\nyouth. Hanging on a peg near by was a set of fine new harness, and\nstanding under the adjoining shed, as he perceived, a handsome new cart.\n\n\"Well, well!\" exclaimed Frank; \"ef I did n' mos' know whar dis mule,\nan' dis kyart, an' dis harness come from, I'd 'low dere 'd be'n\nwitcheraf' er cunjin' wukkin' here.  But, oh my, dat is a fine mule!--I\nmos' wush I could keep 'im.\"\n\nHe crossed the road to the house behind the cedars, and found Mis'\nMolly in the kitchen. \"Mis' Molly,\" he protested, \"I ain't done nuthin'\nter deserve dat mule.  W'at little I done fer you wa'n't done fer pay.\nI'd ruther not keep dem things.\"\n\n\"Fer goodness' sake, Frank!\" exclaimed his neighbor, with a\nwell-simulated air of mystification, \"what are you talkin' about?\"\n\n\"You knows w'at I'm talkin' about, Mis' Molly; you knows well ernuff\nI'm talkin' about dat fine mule an' kyart an' harness over dere in my\nstable.\"\n\n\"How should I know anything about 'em?\" she asked.\n\n\"Now, Mis' Molly!  You folks is jes' tryin' ter fool me, an' make me\ntake somethin' fer nuthin'. I lef' my ole mule an' kyart an' harness in\nde stable las' night, an' dis mawnin' dey 're gone, an' new ones in\ndeir place.  Co'se you knows whar dey come from!\"\n\n\"Well, now, Frank, sence you mention it, I did see a witch flyin' roun'\nhere las' night on a broom-stick, an' it 'peared ter me she lit on yo'r\nbarn, an' I s'pose she turned yo'r old things into new ones. I wouldn't\nbother my mind about it if I was you, for she may turn 'em back any\nnight, you know; an' you might as well have the use of 'em in the mean\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Dat's all foolishness, Mis' Molly, an' I'm gwine ter fetch dat mule\nright over here an' tell yo' son ter gimme my ole one back.\"\n\n\"My son's gone,\" she replied, \"an' I don't know nothin' about yo'r old\nmule.  And what would I do with a mule, anyhow?  I ain't got no barn to\nput him in.\"\n\n\"I suspect you don't care much for us after all, Frank,\" said Rena\nreproachfully--she had come in while they were talking.  \"You meet with\na piece of good luck, and you're afraid of it, lest it might have come\nfrom us.\"\n\n\"Now, Miss Rena, you oughtn't ter say dat,\" expostulated Frank, his\nreluctance yielding immediately. \"I'll keep de mule an' de kyart an' de\nharness--fac', I'll have ter keep 'em, 'cause I ain't got no others.\nBut dey 're gwine ter be yo'n ez much ez mine.  W'enever you wants\nanything hauled, er wants yo' lot ploughed, er anything--dat's yo'\nmule, an' I'm yo' man an' yo' mammy's.\"\n\nSo Frank went back to the stable, where he feasted his eyes on his new\npossessions, fed and watered the mule, and curried and brushed his coat\nuntil it shone like a looking-glass.\n\n\"Now dat,\" remarked Peter, at the breakfast-table, when informed of the\ntransaction, \"is somethin' lack rale w'ite folks.\"\n\nNo real white person had ever given Peter a mule or a cart.  He had\nrendered one of them unpaid service for half a lifetime, and had paid\nfor the other half; and some of them owed him substantial sums for work\nperformed.  But \"to him that hath shall be given\"--Warwick paid for the\nmule, and the real white folks got most of the credit.\n\n\n\nXX\n\nDIGGING UP ROOTS\n\nWhen the first great shock of his discovery wore off, the fact of\nRena's origin lost to Tryon some of its initial repugnance--indeed, the\nrepugnance was not to the woman at all, as their past relations were\nevidence, but merely to the thought of her as a wife. It could hardly\nhave failed to occur to so reasonable a man as Tryon that Rena's case\ncould scarcely be unique.  Surely in the past centuries of free manners\nand easy morals that had prevailed in remote parts of the South, there\nmust have been many white persons whose origin would not have borne too\nmicroscopic an investigation.  Family trees not seldom have a crooked\nbranch; or, to use a more apposite figure, many a flock has its black\nsheep.  Being a man of lively imagination, Tryon soon found himself\nputting all sorts of hypothetical questions about a matter which he had\nalready definitely determined.  If he had married Rena in ignorance of\nher secret, and had learned it afterwards, would he have put her aside?\nIf, knowing her history, he had nevertheless married her, and she had\nsubsequently displayed some trait of character that would suggest the\nnegro, could he have forgotten or forgiven the taint?  Could he still\nhave held her in love and honor?  If not, could he have given her the\noutward seeming of affection, or could he have been more than coldly\ntolerant? He was glad that he had been spared this ordeal. With an\neffort he put the whole matter definitely and conclusively aside, as he\nhad done a hundred times already.\n\nReturning to his home, after an absence of several months in South\nCarolina, it was quite apparent to his mother's watchful eye that he\nwas in serious trouble.  He was absent-minded, monosyllabic, sighed\ndeeply and often, and could not always conceal the traces of secret\ntears.  For Tryon was young, and possessed of a sensitive soul--a\nsource of happiness or misery, as the Fates decree.  To those thus\ndowered, the heights of rapture are accessible, the abysses of despair\nyawn threateningly; only the dull monotony of contentment is denied.\n\nMrs. Tryon vainly sought by every gentle art a woman knows to win her\nson's confidence. \"What is the matter, George, dear?\" she would ask,\nstroking his hot brow with her small, cool hand as he sat moodily\nnursing his grief.  \"Tell your mother, George.  Who else could comfort\nyou so well as she?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, mother,--nothing at all,\" he would reply, with a\nforced attempt at lightness. \"It's only your fond imagination, you best\nof mothers.\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Tryon's turn to sigh and shed a clandestine tear.  Until\nher son had gone away on this trip to South Carolina, he had kept no\nsecrets from her: his heart had been an open book, of which she knew\nevery page; now, some painful story was inscribed therein which he\nmeant she should not read.  If she could have abdicated her empire to\nBlanche Leary or have shared it with her, she would have yielded\ngracefully; but very palpably some other influence than Blanche's had\ndriven joy from her son's countenance and lightness from his heart.\n\n\nMiss Blanche Leary, whom Tryon found in the house upon his return, was\na demure, pretty little blonde, with an amiable disposition, a talent\nfor society, and a pronounced fondness for George Tryon.  A poor girl,\nof an excellent family impoverished by the war, she was distantly\nrelated to Mrs. Tryon, had for a long time enjoyed that lady's favor,\nand was her choice for George's wife when he should be old enough to\nmarry.  A woman less interested than Miss Leary would have perceived\nthat there was something wrong with Tryon. Miss Leary had no doubt that\nthere was a woman at the bottom of it,--for about what else should\nyouth worry but love? or if one's love affairs run smoothly, why should\none worry about anything at all?  Miss Leary, in the nineteen years of\nher mundane existence, had not been without mild experiences of the\nheart, and had hovered for some time on the verge of disappointment\nwith respect to Tryon himself.  A sensitive pride would have driven\nmore than one woman away at the sight of the man of her preference\nsighing like a furnace for some absent fair one.  But Mrs. Tryon was so\ncordial, and insisted so strenuously upon her remaining, that Blanche's\nlove, which was strong, conquered her pride, which was no more than a\nreasonable young woman ought to have who sets success above mere\nsentiment.  She remained in the house and bided her opportunity.  If\nGeorge practically ignored her for a time, she did not throw herself at\nall in his way.  She went on a visit to some girls in the neighborhood\nand remained away a week, hoping that she might be missed.  Tryon\nexpressed no regret at her departure and no particular satisfaction\nupon her return.  If the house was duller in her absence, he was but\ndimly conscious of the difference.  He was still fighting a battle in\nwhich a susceptible heart and a reasonable mind had locked horns in a\nwell-nigh hopeless conflict.  Reason, common-sense, the instinctive\nready-made judgments of his training and environment,--the deep-seated\nprejudices of race and caste,--commanded him to dismiss Rena from his\nthoughts.  His stubborn heart simply would not let go.\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nA GILDED OPPORTUNITY\n\nAlthough the whole fabric of Rena's new life toppled and fell with her\nlover's defection, her sympathies, broadened by culture and still more\nby her recent emotional experience, did not shrink, as would have been\nthe case with a more selfish soul, to the mere limits of her personal\nsorrow, great as this seemed at the moment.  She had learned to love,\nand when the love of one man failed her, she turned to humanity, as a\nstream obstructed in its course overflows the adjacent country.  Her\nearly training had not directed her thoughts to the darker people with\nwhose fate her own was bound up so closely, but rather away from them.\nShe had been taught to despise them because they were not so white as\nshe was, and had been slaves while she was free.  Her life in her\nbrother's home, by removing her from immediate contact with them, had\ngiven her a different point of view,--one which emphasized their\nshortcomings, and thereby made vastly clearer to her the gulf that\nseparated them from the new world in which she lived; so that when\nmisfortune threw her back upon them, the reaction brought her nearer\nthan before.  Where once she had seemed able to escape from them, they\nwere now, it appeared, her inalienable race.  Thus doubly equipped, she\nwas able to view them at once with the mental eye of an outsider and\nthe sympathy of a sister: she could see their faults, and judge them\ncharitably; she knew and appreciated their good qualities.  With her\nquickened intelligence she could perceive how great was their need and\nhow small their opportunity; and with this illumination came the desire\nto contribute to their help. She had not the breadth or culture to see\nin all its ramifications the great problem which still puzzles\nstatesmen and philosophers; but she was conscious of the wish, and of\nthe power, in a small way, to do something for the advancement of those\nwho had just set their feet upon the ladder of progress.\n\nThis new-born desire to be of service to her rediscovered people was\nnot long without an opportunity for expression.  Yet the Fates willed\nthat her future should be but another link in a connected chain: she\nwas to be as powerless to put aside her recent past as she had been to\nescape from the influence of her earlier life.  There are sordid souls\nthat eat and drink and breed and die, and imagine they have lived.  But\nRena's life since her great awakening had been that of the emotions,\nand her temperament made of it a continuous life.  Her successive\nstates of consciousness were not detachable, but united to form a\nsingle if not an entirely harmonious whole.  To her sensitive spirit\nto-day was born of yesterday, to-morrow would be but the offspring of\nto day.\n\nOne day, along toward noon, her mother received a visit from Mary B.\nPettifoot, a second cousin, who lived on Back Street, only a short\ndistance from the house behind the cedars.  Rena had gone out, so that\nthe visitor found Mis' Molly alone.\n\n\"I heared you say, Cousin Molly,\" said Mary B. (no one ever knew what\nthe B. in Mary's name stood for,--it was a mere ornamental flourish),\n\"that Rena was talkin' 'bout teachin' school.  I've got a good chance\nfer her, ef she keers ter take it.  My cousin Jeff Wain 'rived in town\nthis mo'nin', f'm 'way down in Sampson County, ter git a teacher fer\nthe nigger school in his deestric'. I s'pose he mought 'a' got one f'm\n'roun' Newbern, er Goldsboro, er some er them places eas', but he\n'lowed he'd like to visit some er his kin an' ole frien's, an' so kill\ntwo birds with one stone.\"\n\n\"I seed a strange mulatter man, with a bay hoss an' a new buggy,\ndrivin' by here this mo'nin' early, from down to'ds the river,\"\nrejoined Mis' Molly. \"I wonder if that wuz him?\"\n\n\"Did he have on a linen duster?\" asked Mary B.\n\n\"Yas, an' 'peared to be a very well sot up man,\" replied Mis' Molly,\n\"'bout thirty-five years old, I should reckon.\"\n\n\"That wuz him,\" assented Mary B.  \"He's got a fine hoss an' buggy, an'\na gol' watch an' chain, an' a big plantation, an' lots er hosses an'\nmules an' cows an' hawgs.  He raise' fifty bales er cotton las' year,\nan' he's be'n ter the legislatur'.\"\n\n\"My gracious!\" exclaimed Mis' Molly, struck with awe at this catalogue\nof the stranger's possessions--he was evidently worth more than a great\nmany \"rich\" white people,--all white people in North Carolina in those\ndays were either \"rich\" or \"poor,\" the distinction being one of caste\nrather than of wealth.  \"Is he married?\" she inquired with interest?\n\n\"No,--single.  You mought 'low it was quare that he should n' be\nmarried at his age; but he was crossed in love oncet,\"--Mary B. heaved\na self-conscious sigh,--\"an' has stayed single ever sence.  That wuz\nten years ago, but as some husban's is long-lived, an' there ain' no\nmo' chance fer 'im now than there wuz then, I reckon some nice gal\nmought stan' a good show er ketchin' 'im, ef she'd play her kyards\nright.\"\n\nTo Mis' Molly this was news of considerable importance.  She had not\nthought a great deal of Rena's plan to teach; she considered it\nlowering for Rena, after having been white, to go among the negroes any\nmore than was unavoidable.  This opportunity, however, meant more than\nmere employment for her daughter.  She had felt Rena's disappointment\nkeenly, from the practical point of view, and, blaming herself for it,\nheld herself all the more bound to retrieve the misfortune in any\npossible way.  If she had not been sick, Rena would not have dreamed\nthe fateful dream that had brought her to Patesville; for the\nconnection between the vision and the reality was even closer in Mis'\nMolly's eyes than in Rena's.  If the mother had not sent the letter\nannouncing her illness and confirming the dream, Rena would not have\nruined her promising future by coming to Patesville.  But the harm had\nbeen done, and she was responsible, ignorantly of course, but none the\nless truly, and it only remained for her to make amends, as far as\npossible.  Her highest ambition, since Rena had grown up, had been to\nsee her married and comfortably settled in life.  She had no hope that\nTryon would come back.  Rena had declared that she would make no\nfurther effort to get away from her people; and, furthermore, that she\nwould never marry.  To this latter statement Mis' Molly secretly\nattached but little importance.  That a woman should go single from the\ncradle to the grave did not accord with her experience in life of the\ncustoms of North Carolina.  She respected a grief she could not\nentirely fathom, yet did not for a moment believe that Rena would\nremain unmarried.\n\n\"You'd better fetch him roun' to see me, Ma'y B.,\" she said, \"an' let's\nsee what he looks like. I'm pertic'lar 'bout my gal.  She says she\nain't goin' to marry nobody; but of co'se we know that's all\nfoolishness.\"\n\n\"I'll fetch him roun' this evenin' 'bout three o'clock,\" said the\nvisitor, rising.  \"I mus' hurry back now an' keep him comp'ny.  Tell\nRena ter put on her bes' bib an' tucker; for Mr. Wain is pertic'lar\ntoo, an' I've already be'n braggin' 'bout her looks.\"\n\nWhen Mary B., at the appointed hour, knocked at Mis' Molly's front\ndoor,--the visit being one of ceremony, she had taken her cousin round\nto the Front Street entrance and through the flower garden,--Mis' Molly\nwas prepared to receive them. After a decent interval, long enough to\nsuggest that she had not been watching their approach and was not\nover-eager about the visit, she answered the knock and admitted them\ninto the parlor.  Mr. Wain was formally introduced, and seated himself\non the ancient haircloth sofa, under the framed fashion-plate, while\nMary B. sat by the open door and fanned herself with a palm-leaf fan.\n\nMis' Molly's impression of Wain was favorable. His complexion was of a\nlight brown--not quite so fair as Mis' Molly would have preferred; but\nany deficiency in this regard, or in the matter of the stranger's\nfeatures, which, while not unpleasing, leaned toward the broad mulatto\ntype, was more than compensated in her eyes by very straight black\nhair, and, as soon appeared, a great facility of complimentary speech.\nOn his introduction Mr. Wain bowed low, assumed an air of great\nadmiration, and expressed his extreme delight in making the\nacquaintance of so distinguished-looking a lady.\n\n\"You're flatt'rin' me, Mr. Wain,\" returned Mis' Molly, with a gratified\nsmile.  \"But you want to meet my daughter befo' you commence th'owin'\nbokays.  Excuse my leavin' you--I'll go an' fetch her.\"\n\nShe returned in a moment, followed by Rena. \"Mr. Wain, 'low me to\nint'oduce you to my daughter Rena.  Rena, this is Ma'y B.'s cousin on\nher pappy's side, who's come up from Sampson to git a school-teacher.\"\n\nRena bowed gracefully.  Wain stared a moment in genuine astonishment,\nand then bent himself nearly double, keeping his eyes fixed meanwhile\nupon Rena's face.  He had expected to see a pretty yellow girl, but had\nbeen prepared for no such radiant vision of beauty as this which now\nconfronted him.\n\n\"Does--does you mean ter say, Mis' Walden, dat--dat dis young lady is\nyo' own daughter?\" he stammered, rallying his forces for action.\n\n\"Why not, Mr. Wain?\" asked Mis' Molly, bridling with mock resentment.\n\"Do you mean ter 'low that she wuz changed in her cradle, er is she too\ngood-lookin' to be my daughter?\"\n\n\"My deah Mis' Walden! it 'ud be wastin' wo'ds fer me ter say dat dey\nain' no young lady too good-lookin' ter be yo' daughter; but you're\nlookin' so young yo'sef dat I'd ruther take her fer yo' sister.\"\n\n\"Yas,\" rejoined Mis' Molly, with animation, \"they ain't many years\nbetween us.  I wuz ruther young myself when she wuz bo'n.\"\n\n\"An', mo'over,\" Wain went on, \"it takes me a minute er so ter git my\nmin' use' ter thinkin' er Mis' Rena as a cullud young lady.  I mought\n'a' seed her a hund'ed times, an' I'd 'a' never dreamt but w'at she wuz\na w'ite young lady, f'm one er de bes' families.\"\n\n\"Yas, Mr. Wain,\" replied Mis' Molly complacently, \"all three er my\nchild'en wuz white, an' one of 'em has be'n on the other side fer many\nlong years.  Rena has be'n to school, an' has traveled, an' has had\nchances--better chances than anybody roun' here knows.\"\n\n\"She's jes' de lady I'm lookin' fer, ter teach ou' school,\" rejoined\nWain, with emphasis.  \"Wid her schoolin' an' my riccommen', she kin git\na fus'-class ce'tifikit an' draw fo'ty dollars a month; an' a lady er\nher color kin keep a lot er little niggers straighter 'n a darker lady\ncould.  We jus' got ter have her ter teach ou' school--ef we kin git\nher.\"\n\nRena's interest in the prospect of employment at her chosen work was so\ngreat that she paid little attention to Wain's compliments.  Mis' Molly\nled Mary B. away to the kitchen on some pretext, and left Rena to\nentertain the gentleman.  She questioned him eagerly about the school,\nand he gave the most glowing accounts of the elegant school-house, the\nbright pupils, and the congenial society of the neighborhood.  He spoke\nalmost entirely in superlatives, and, after making due allowance for\nwhat Rena perceived to be a temperamental tendency to exaggeration, she\nconcluded that she would find in the school a worthy field of\nusefulness, and in this polite and good-natured though somewhat wordy\nman a coadjutor upon whom she could rely in her first efforts; for she\nwas not over-confident of her powers, which seemed to grow less as the\nway opened for their exercise.\n\n\"Do you think I'm competent to teach the school?\" she asked of the\nvisitor, after stating some of her qualifications.\n\n\"Oh, dere 's no doubt about it, Miss Rena,\" replied Wain, who had\nlistened with an air of great wisdom, though secretly aware that he was\ntoo ignorant of letters to form a judgment; \"you kin teach de school\nall right, an' could ef you didn't know half ez much.  You won't have\nno trouble managin' de child'en, nuther.  Ef any of 'em gits onruly,\njes' call on me fer he'p, an' I'll make 'em walk Spanish.  I'm chuhman\ner de school committee, an' I'll lam de hide off'n any scholar dat don'\nbehave.  You kin trus' me fer dat, sho' ez I'm a-settin' here.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Rena, \"I'll undertake it, and do my best.  I'm sure you'll\nnot be too exacting.\"\n\n\"Yo' bes', Miss Rena,'ll be de bes' dey is. Don' you worry ner fret.\nDem niggers won't have no other teacher after dey've once laid eyes on\nyou:  I'll guarantee dat.  Dere won't be no trouble, not a bit.\"\n\n\"Well, Cousin Molly,\" said Mary B. to Mis' Molly in the kitchen, \"how\ndoes the plan strike you?\"\n\n\"Ef Rena's satisfied, I am,\" replied Mis' Molly. \"But you'd better say\nnothin' about ketchin' a beau, or any such foolishness, er else she'd\nbe just as likely not to go nigh Sampson County.\"\n\n\"Befo' Cousin Jeff goes back,\" confided Mary B., \"I'd like ter give 'im\na party, but my house is too small.  I wuz wonderin',\" she added\ntentatively, \"ef I could n' borry yo' house.\"\n\n\"Shorely, Ma'y B. I'm int'rested in Mr. Wain on Rena's account, an'\nit's as little as I kin do to let you use my house an' help you git\nthings ready.\"\n\nThe date of the party was set for Thursday night, as Wain was to leave\nPatesville on Friday morning, taking with him the new teacher.  The\nparty would serve the double purpose of a compliment to the guest and a\nfarewell to Rena, and it might prove the precursor, the mother secretly\nhoped, of other festivities to follow at some later date.\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nIMPERATIVE BUSINESS\n\nOne Wednesday morning, about six weeks after his return home, Tryon\nreceived a letter from Judge Straight with reference to the note left\nwith him at Patesville for collection.  This communication properly\nrequired an answer, which might have been made in writing within the\ncompass of ten lines.  No sooner, however, had Tryon read the letter\nthan he began to perceive reasons why it should be answered in person.\nHe had left Patesville under extremely painful circumstances, vowing\nthat he would never return; and yet now the barest pretext, by which no\none could have been deceived except willingly, was sufficient to turn\nhis footsteps thither again.  He explained to his mother--with a\nvagueness which she found somewhat puzzling, but ascribed to her own\nfeminine obtuseness in matters of business--the reasons that\nimperatively demanded his presence in Patesville.  With an early start\nhe could drive there in one day,--he had an excellent roadster, a light\nbuggy, and a recent rain had left the road in good condition,--a day\nwould suffice for the transaction of his business, and the third day\nwould bring him home again.  He set out on his journey on Thursday\nmorning, with this programme very clearly outlined.\n\nTryon would not at first have admitted even to himself that Rena's\npresence in Patesville had any bearing whatever upon his projected\nvisit.  The matter about which Judge Straight had written might, it was\nclear, be viewed in several aspects. The judge had written him\nconcerning the one of immediate importance.  It would be much easier to\ndiscuss the subject in all its bearings, and clean up the whole matter,\nin one comprehensive personal interview.\n\nThe importance of this business, then, seemed very urgent for the first\nfew hours of Tryon's journey.  Ordinarily a careful driver and merciful\nto his beast, his eagerness to reach Patesville increased gradually\nuntil it became necessary to exercise some self-restraint in order not\nto urge his faithful mare beyond her powers; and soon he could no\nlonger pretend obliviousness of the fact that some attraction stronger\nthan the whole amount of Duncan McSwayne's note was urging him\nirresistibly toward his destination.  The old town beyond the distant\nriver, his heart told him clamorously, held the object in all the world\nto him most dear.  Memory brought up in vivid detail every moment of\nhis brief and joyous courtship, each tender word, each enchanting\nsmile, every fond caress.  He lived his past happiness over again down\nto the moment of that fatal discovery.  What horrible fate was it that\nhad involved him--nay, that had caught this sweet delicate girl in such\na blind alley?  A wild hope flashed across his mind: perhaps the\nghastly story might not be true; perhaps, after all, the girl was no\nmore a negro than she seemed.  He had heard sad stories of white\nchildren, born out of wedlock, abandoned by sinful parents to the care\nor adoption of colored women, who had reared them as their own, the\nchildren's future basely sacrificed to hide the parents' shame.  He\nwould confront this reputed mother of his darling and wring the truth\nfrom her.  He was in a state of mind where any sort of a fairy tale\nwould have seemed reasonable. He would almost have bribed some one to\ntell him that the woman he had loved, the woman he still loved (he felt\na thrill of lawless pleasure in the confession), was not the descendant\nof slaves,--that he might marry her, and not have before his eyes the\ngruesome fear that some one of their children might show even the\nfaintest mark of the despised race.\n\nAt noon he halted at a convenient hamlet, fed and watered his mare, and\nresumed his journey after an hour's rest.  By this time he had\nwell-nigh forgotten about the legal business that formed the ostensible\noccasion for his journey, and was conscious only of a wild desire to\nsee the woman whose image was beckoning him on to Patesville as fast as\nhis horse could take him.\n\nAt sundown he stopped again, about ten miles from the town, and cared\nfor his now tired beast. He knew her capacity, however, and calculated\nthat she could stand the additional ten miles without injury.  The mare\nset out with reluctance, but soon settled resignedly down into a steady\njog.\n\nMemory had hitherto assailed Tryon with the vision of past joys.  As he\nneared the town, imagination attacked him with still more moving\nimages.  He had left her, this sweet flower of womankind--white or not,\nGod had never made a fairer!--he had seen her fall to the hard\npavement, with he knew not what resulting injury. He had left her\ntender frame--the touch of her finger-tips had made him thrill with\nhappiness--to be lifted by strange hands, while he with heartless pride\nhad driven deliberately away, without a word of sorrow or regret.  He\nhad ignored her as completely as though she had never existed.  That he\nhad been deceived was true.  But had he not aided in his own deception?\nHad not Warwick told him distinctly that they were of no family, and\nwas it not his own fault that he had not followed up the clue thus\ngiven him?  Had not Rena compared herself to the child's nurse, and had\nhe not assured her that if she were the nurse, he would marry her next\nday?  The deception had been due more to his own blindness than to any\nlack of honesty on the part of Rena and her brother.  In the light of\nhis present feelings they seemed to have been absurdly outspoken.  He\nwas glad that he had kept his discovery to himself. He had considered\nhimself very magnanimous not to have exposed the fraud that was being\nperpetrated upon society: it was with a very comfortable feeling that\nhe now realized that the matter was as profound a secret as before.\n\n\"She ought to have been born white,\" he muttered, adding weakly, \"I\nwould to God that I had never found her out!\"\n\nDrawing near the bridge that crossed the river to the town, he pictured\nto himself a pale girl, with sorrowful, tear-stained eyes, pining away\nin the old gray house behind the cedars for love of him, dying,\nperhaps, of a broken heart.  He would hasten to her; he would dry her\ntears with kisses; he would express sorrow for his cruelty.\n\nThe tired mare had crossed the bridge and was slowly toiling up Front\nStreet; she was near the limit of her endurance, and Tryon did not urge\nher.\n\nThey might talk the matter over, and if they must part, part at least\nthey would in peace and friendship.  If he could not marry her, he\nwould never marry any one else; it would be cruel for him to seek\nhappiness while she was denied it, for, having once given her heart to\nhim, she could never, he was sure,--so instinctively fine was her\nnature,--she could never love any one less worthy than himself, and\nwould therefore probably never marry.  He knew from a Clarence\nacquaintance, who had written him a letter, that Rena had not\nreappeared in that town.\n\nIf he should discover--the chance was one in a thousand--that she was\nwhite; or if he should find it too hard to leave her--ah, well! he was\na white man, one of a race born to command.  He would make her white;\nno one beyond the old town would ever know the difference.  If,\nperchance, their secret should be disclosed, the world was wide; a man\nof courage and ambition, inspired by love, might make a career\nanywhere.  Circumstances made weak men; strong men mould circumstances\nto do their bidding.  He would not let his darling die of grief,\nwhatever the price must be paid for her salvation.  She was only a few\nrods away from him now.  In a moment he would see her; he would take\nher tenderly in his arms, and heart to heart they would mutually\nforgive and forget, and, strengthened by their love, would face the\nfuture boldly and bid the world do its worst.\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTHE GUEST OF HONOR\n\nThe evening of the party arrived.  The house had been thoroughly\ncleaned in preparation for the event, and decorated with the choicest\ntreasures of the garden.  By eight o'clock the guests had gathered.\nThey were all mulattoes,--all people of mixed blood were called\n\"mulattoes\" in North Carolina.  There were dark mulattoes and bright\nmulattoes.  Mis' Molly's guests were mostly of the bright class, most\nof them more than half white, and few of them less.  In Mis' Molly's\nsmall circle, straight hair was the only palliative of a dark\ncomplexion.  Many of the guests would not have been casually\ndistinguishable from white people of the poorer class.  Others bore\nunmistakable traces of Indian ancestry,--for Cherokee and Tuscarora\nblood was quite widely diffused among the free negroes of North\nCarolina, though well-nigh lost sight of by the curious custom of the\nwhite people to ignore anything but the negro blood in those who were\ntouched by its potent current.  Very few of those present had been\nslaves.  The free colored people of Patesville were numerous enough\nbefore the war to have their own \"society,\" and human enough to despise\nthose who did not possess advantages equal to their own; and at this\ntime they still looked down upon those who had once been held in\nbondage.  The only black man present occupied a chair which stood on a\nbroad chest in one corner, and extracted melody from a fiddle to which\na whole generation of the best people of Patesville had danced and made\nmerry.  Uncle Needham seldom played for colored gatherings, but made an\nexception in Mis' Molly's case; she was not white, but he knew her\npast; if she was not the rose, she had at least been near the rose.\nWhen the company had gathered, Mary B., as mistress of ceremonies,\nwhispered to Uncle Needham, who tapped his violin sharply with the bow.\n\n\"Ladies an' gent'emens, take yo' pa'dners fer a Fuhginny reel!\"\n\nMr. Wain, as the guest of honor, opened the ball with his hostess.  He\nwore a broadcloth coat and trousers, a heavy glittering chain across\nthe spacious front of his white waistcoat, and a large red rose in his\nbuttonhole.  If his boots were slightly run down at the heel, so\ntrivial a detail passed unnoticed in the general splendor of his\nattire.  Upon a close or hostile inspection there would have been some\nfeatures of his ostensibly good-natured face--the shifty eye, the full\nand slightly drooping lower lip--which might have given a student of\nphysiognomy food for reflection. But whatever the latent defects of\nWain's character, he proved himself this evening a model of geniality,\npresuming not at all upon his reputed wealth, but winning golden\nopinions from those who came to criticise, of whom, of course, there\nwere a few, the company being composed of human beings.\n\nWhen the dance began, Wain extended his large, soft hand to Mary B.,\nyellow, buxom, thirty, with white and even teeth glistening behind her\nfull red lips.  A younger sister of Mary B.'s was paired with Billy\nOxendine, a funny little tailor, a great gossip, and therefore a\nfavorite among the women.  Mis' Molly graciously consented, after many\nprotestations of lack of skill and want of practice, to stand up\nopposite Homer Pettifoot, Mary B.'s husband, a tall man, with a slight\nstoop, a bald crown, and full, dreamy eyes,--a man of much imagination\nand a large fund of anecdote. Two other couples completed the set;\nothers were restrained by bashfulness or religious scruples, which did\nnot yield until later in the evening.\n\nThe perfumed air from the garden without and the cut roses within\nmingled incongruously with the alien odors of musk and hair oil, of\nwhich several young barbers in the company were especially redolent.\nThere was a play of sparkling eyes and glancing feet.  Mary B. danced\nwith the languorous grace of an Eastern odalisque, Mis' Molly with the\nmincing, hesitating step of one long out of practice.  Wain performed\nsaltatory prodigies.  This was a golden opportunity for the display in\nwhich his soul found delight.  He introduced variations hitherto\nunknown to the dance.  His skill and suppleness brought a glow of\nadmiration into the eyes of the women, and spread a cloud of jealousy\nover the faces of several of the younger men, who saw themselves\neclipsed.\n\nRena had announced in advance her intention to take no active part in\nthe festivities.  \"I don't feel like dancing, mamma--I shall never\ndance again.\"\n\n\"Well, now, Rena,\" answered her mother, \"of co'se you're too dignified,\nsence you've be'n 'sociatin' with white folks, to be hoppin' roun' an'\nkickin' up like Ma'y B. an' these other yaller gals; but of co'se, too,\nyou can't slight the comp'ny entirely, even ef it ain't jest exac'ly\nour party,--you'll have to pay 'em some little attention, 'specially\nMr. Wain, sence you're goin' down yonder with 'im.\"\n\nRena conscientiously did what she thought politeness required.  She\nwent the round of the guests in the early part of the evening and\nexchanged greetings with them.  To several requests for dances she\nreplied that she was not dancing.  She did not hold herself aloof\nbecause of pride; any instinctive shrinking she might have felt by\nreason of her recent association with persons of greater refinement was\noffset by her still more newly awakened zeal for humanity; they were\nher people, she must not despise them.  But the occasion suggested\npainful memories of other and different scenes in which she had lately\nparticipated.  Once or twice these memories were so vivid as almost to\noverpower her.  She slipped away from the company, and kept in the\nbackground as much as possible without seeming to slight any one.\n\nThe guests as well were dimly conscious of a slight barrier between\nMis' Molly's daughter and themselves.  The time she had spent apart\nfrom these friends of her youth had rendered it impossible for her ever\nto meet them again upon the plane of common interests and common\nthoughts.  It was much as though one, having acquired the vernacular of\nhis native country, had lived in a foreign land long enough to lose the\nlanguage of his childhood without acquiring fully that of his adopted\ncountry.  Miss Rowena Warwick could never again become quite the Rena\nWalden who had left the house behind the cedars no more than a year and\na half before.  Upon this very difference were based her noble\naspirations for usefulness,--one must stoop in order that one may lift\nothers.  Any other young woman present would have been importuned\nbeyond her powers of resistance.  Rena's reserve was respected.\n\nWhen supper was announced, somewhat early in the evening, the dancers\nfound seats in the hall or on the front piazza.  Aunt Zilphy, assisted\nby Mis' Molly and Mary B., passed around the refreshments, which\nconsisted of fried chicken, buttered biscuits, pound-cake, and eggnog.\nWhen the first edge of appetite was taken off, the conversation waxed\nanimated.  Homer Pettifoot related, with minute detail, an old,\nthreadbare hunting lie, dating, in slightly differing forms, from the\nage of Nimrod, about finding twenty-five partridges sitting in a row on\na rail, and killing them all with a single buckshot, which passed\nthrough twenty-four and lodged in the body of the twenty-fifth, from\nwhich it was extracted and returned to the shot pouch for future\nservice.\n\nThis story was followed by a murmur of incredulity--of course, the\nthing was possible, but Homer's faculty for exaggeration was so well\nknown that any statement of his was viewed with suspicion.  Homer\nseemed hurt at this lack of faith, and was disposed to argue the point,\nbut the sonorous voice of Mr. Wain on the other side of the room cut\nshort his protestations, in much the same way that the rising sun\nextinguishes the light of lesser luminaries.\n\n\"I wuz a member er de fus' legislatur' after de wah,\" Wain was saying.\n\"When I went up f'm Sampson in de fall, I had to pass th'ough\nSmithfiel', I got in town in de afternoon, an' put up at de bes' hotel.\nDe lan'lo'd did n' have no s'picion but what I wuz a white man, an' he\ngimme a room, an' I had supper an' breakfas', an' went on ter Rolly\nnex' mornin'.  W'en de session wuz over, I come along back, an' w'en I\ngot ter Smithfiel', I driv' up ter de same hotel.  I noticed, as soon\nas I got dere, dat de place had run down consid'able--dere wuz weeds\ngrowin' in de yard, de winders wuz dirty, an' ev'ything roun' dere\nlooked kinder lonesome an' shif'less.  De lan'lo'd met me at de do'; he\nlooked mighty down in de mouth, an' sezee:--\n\n\"'Look a-here, w'at made you come an' stop at my place widout tellin'\nme you wuz a black man? Befo' you come th'ough dis town I had a\nfus'-class business.  But w'en folks found out dat a nigger had put up\nhere, business drapped right off, an' I've had ter shet up my hotel.\nYou oughter be 'shamed er yo'se'f fer ruinin' a po' man w'at had n'\nnever done no harm ter you.  You've done a mean, low-lived thing, an' a\njes' God'll punish you fer it.'\n\n\"De po' man acshully bust inter tears,\" continued Mr. Wain\nmagnanimously, \"an' I felt so sorry fer 'im--he wuz a po' white man\ntryin' ter git up in de worl'--dat I hauled out my purse an' gin 'im\nten dollars, an' he 'peared monst'ous glad ter git it.\"\n\n\"How good-hearted!  How kin'!\" murmured the ladies.  \"It done credit to\nyo' feelin's.\"\n\n\"Don't b'lieve a word er dem lies,\" muttered one young man to another\nsarcastically.  \"He could n' pass fer white, 'less'n it wuz a mighty\ndark night.\"\n\nUpon this glorious evening of his life, Mr. Jefferson Wain had one\ndistinctly hostile critic, of whose presence he was blissfully\nunconscious. Frank Fowler had not been invited to the party,--his\nfamily did not go with Mary B.'s set.  Rena had suggested to her mother\nthat he be invited, but Mis' Molly had demurred on the ground that it\nwas not her party, and that she had no right to issue invitations.  It\nis quite likely that she would have sought an invitation for Frank from\nMary B.; but Frank was black, and would not harmonize with the rest of\nthe company, who would not have Mis' Molly's reasons for treating him\nwell.  She had compromised the matter by stepping across the way in the\nafternoon and suggesting that Frank might come over and sit on the back\nporch and look at the dancing and share in the supper.\n\nFrank was not without a certain honest pride. He was sensitive enough,\ntoo, not to care to go where he was not wanted.  He would have curtly\nrefused any such maimed invitation to any other place.  But would he\nnot see Rena in her best attire, and might she not perhaps, in passing,\nspeak a word to him?\n\n\"Thank y', Mis' Molly,\" he replied, \"I'll prob'ly come over.\"\n\n\"You're a big fool, boy,\" observed his father after Mis' Molly had gone\nback across the street, \"ter be stickin' roun' dem yaller niggers\n'cross de street, an' slobb'rin' an' slav'rin' over 'em, an' hangin'\nroun' deir back do' wuss 'n ef dey wuz w'ite folks. I'd see 'em dead\nfus'!\"\n\nFrank himself resisted the temptation for half an hour after the music\nbegan, but at length he made his way across the street and stationed\nhimself at the window opening upon the back piazza. When Rena was in\nthe room, he had eyes for her only, but when she was absent, he fixed\nhis attention mainly upon Wain.  With jealous clairvoyance he observed\nthat Wain's eyes followed Rena when she left the room, and lit up when\nshe returned.  Frank had heard that Rena was going away with this man,\nand he watched Wain closely, liking him less the longer he looked at\nhim.  To his fancy, Wain's style and skill were affectation, his\ngood-nature mere hypocrisy, and his glance at Rena the eye of the hawk\nupon his quarry.  He had heard that Wain was unmarried, and he could\nnot see how, this being so, he could help wishing Rena for a wife.\nFrank would have been content to see her marry a white man, who would\nhave raised her to a plane worthy of her merits.  In this man's shifty\neye he read the liar--his wealth and standing were probably as false as\nhis seeming good-humor.\n\n\"Is that you, Frank?\" said a soft voice near at hand.\n\nHe looked up with a joyful thrill.  Rena was peering intently at him,\nas if trying to distinguish his features in the darkness.  It was a\nbright moonlight night, but Frank stood in the shadow of the piazza.\n\n\"Yas 'm, it's me, Miss Rena.  Yo' mammy said I could come over an' see\nyou-all dance.  You ain' be'n out on de flo' at all, ter-night.\"\n\n\"No, Frank, I don't care for dancing.  I shall not dance to-night.\"\n\nThis answer was pleasing to Frank.  If he could not hope to dance with\nher, at least the men inside--at least this snake in the grass from\ndown the country--should not have that privilege.\n\n\"But you must have some supper, Frank,\" said Rena.  \"I'll bring it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"No, Miss Rena, I don' keer fer nothin'--I did n' come over ter\neat--r'al'y I didn't.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Frank, there's plenty of it.  I have no appetite, and you\nshall have my portion.\"\n\nShe brought him a slice of cake and a glass of eggnog.  When Mis'\nMolly, a minute later, came out upon the piazza, Frank left the yard\nand walked down the street toward the old canal.  Rena had spoken\nsoftly to him; she had fed him with her own dainty hands.  He might\nnever hope that she would see in him anything but a friend; but he\nloved her, and he would watch over her and protect her, wherever she\nmight be.  He did not believe that she would ever marry the grinning\nhypocrite masquerading back there in Mis' Molly's parlor; but the man\nwould bear watching.\n\nMis' Molly had come to call her daughter into the house.  \"Rena,\" she\nsaid, \"Mr. Wain wants ter know if you won't dance just one dance with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yas, Rena,\" pleaded Mary B., who followed Miss Molly out to the\npiazza, \"jes' one dance.  I don't think you're treatin' my comp'ny jes'\nright, Cousin Rena.\"\n\n\"You're goin' down there with 'im,\" added her mother, \"an' it 'd be\njust as well to be on friendly terms with 'im.\"\n\nWain himself had followed the women.  \"Sho'ly, Miss Rena, you're gwine\nter honah me wid one dance?  I'd go 'way f'm dis pa'ty sad at hea't ef\nI had n' stood up oncet wid de young lady er de house.\"\n\nAs Rena, weakly persuaded, placed her hand on Wain's arm and entered\nthe house, a buggy, coming up Front Street, paused a moment at the\ncorner, and then turning slowly, drove quietly up the nameless\nby-street, concealed by the intervening cedars, until it reached a\npoint from which the occupant could view, through the open front\nwindow, the interior of the parlor.\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nSWING YOUR PARTNERS\n\nMoved by tenderness and thoughts of self-sacrifice, which had occupied\nhis mind to the momentary exclusion of all else, Tryon had scarcely\nnoticed, as he approached the house behind the cedars, a strain of\nlively music, to which was added, as he drew still nearer, the\naccompaniment of other festive sounds.  He suddenly awoke, however, to\nthe fact that these signs of merriment came from the house at which he\nhad intended to stop;--he had not meant that Rena should pass another\nsleepless night of sorrow, or that he should himself endure another\nneedless hour of suspense.\n\nHe drew rein at the corner.  Shocked surprise, a nascent anger, a vague\nalarm, an insistent curiosity, urged him nearer.  Turning the mare into\nthe side street and keeping close to the fence, he drove ahead in the\nshadow of the cedars until he reached a gap through which he could see\ninto the open door and windows of the brightly lighted hall.\n\nThere was evidently a ball in progress.  The fiddle was squeaking\nmerrily so a tune that he remembered well,--it was associated with one\nof the most delightful evenings of his life, that of the tournament\nball.  A mellow negro voice was calling with a rhyming accompaniment\nthe figures of a quadrille.  Tryon, with parted lips and slowly\nhardening heart, leaned forward from the buggy-seat, gripping the rein\nso tightly that his nails cut into the opposing palm.  Above the\nclatter of noisy conversation rose the fiddler's voice:--\n\n     \"Swing yo' pa'dners; doan be shy,\n       Look yo' lady in de eye!\n       Th'ow yo' ahm aroun' huh wais';\n       Take yo' time--dey ain' no has'e!\"\n\nTo the middle of the floor, in full view through an open window,\nadvanced the woman who all day long had been the burden of his\nthoughts--not pale with grief and hollow-eyed with weeping, but flushed\nwith pleasure, around her waist the arm of a burly, grinning mulatto,\nwhose face was offensively familiar to Tryon.\n\nWith a muttered curse of concentrated bitterness, Tryon struck the mare\na sharp blow with the whip.  The sensitive creature, spirited even in\nher great weariness, resented the lash and started off with the bit in\nher teeth.  Perceiving that it would be difficult to turn in the narrow\nroadway without running into the ditch at the left, Tryon gave the mare\nrein and dashed down the street, scarcely missing, as the buggy crossed\nthe bridge, a man standing abstractedly by the old canal, who sprang\naside barely in time to avoid being run over.\n\nMeantime Rena was passing through a trying ordeal.  After the first few\nbars, the fiddler plunged into a well-known air, in which Rena, keenly\nsusceptible to musical impressions, recognized the tune to which, as\nQueen of Love and Beauty, she had opened the dance at her entrance into\nthe world of life and love, for it was there she had met George Tryon.\nThe combination of music and movement brought up the scene with great\ndistinctness.  Tryon, peering angrily through the cedars, had not been\nmore conscious than she of the external contrast between her partners\non this and the former occasion.  She perceived, too, as Tryon from the\noutside had not, the difference between Wain's wordy flattery (only\nsaved by his cousin's warning from pointed and fulsome adulation), and\nthe tenderly graceful compliment, couched in the romantic terms of\nchivalry, with which the knight of the handkerchief had charmed her\near.  It was only by an immense effort that she was able to keep her\nemotions under control until the end of the dance, when she fled to her\nchamber and burst into tears.  It was not the cruel Tryon who had\nblasted her love with his deadly look that she mourned, but the gallant\nyoung knight who had worn her favor on his lance and crowned her Queen\nof Love and Beauty.\n\n\nTryon's stay in Patesville was very brief.  He drove to the hotel and\nput up for the night.  During many sleepless hours his mind was in a\nturmoil with a very different set of thoughts from those which had\noccupied it on the way to town.  Not the least of them was a profound\nself-contempt for his own lack of discernment.  How had he been so\nblind as not to have read long ago the character of this wretched girl\nwho had bewitched him? To-night his eyes had been opened--he had seen\nher with the mask thrown off, a true daughter of a race in which the\nsensuous enjoyment of the moment took precedence of taste or sentiment\nor any of the higher emotions.  Her few months of boarding-school, her\nbrief association with white people, had evidently been a mere veneer\nover the underlying negro, and their effects had slipped away as soon\nas the intercourse had ceased.  With the monkey-like imitativeness of\nthe negro she had copied the manners of white people while she lived\namong them, and had dropped them with equal facility when they ceased\nto serve a purpose.  Who but a negro could have recovered so soon from\nwhat had seemed a terrible bereavement?--she herself must have felt it\nat the time, for otherwise she would not have swooned.  A woman of\nsensibility, as this one had seemed to be, should naturally feel more\nkeenly, and for a longer time than a man, an injury to the affections;\nbut he, a son of the ruling race, had been miserable for six weeks\nabout a girl who had so far forgotten him as already to plunge headlong\ninto the childish amusements of her own ignorant and degraded people.\nWhat more, indeed, he asked himself savagely,--what more could be\nexpected of the base-born child of the plaything of a gentleman's idle\nhour, who to this ignoble origin added the blood of a servile race?\nAnd he, George Tryon, had honored her with his love; he had very nearly\nlinked his fate and joined his blood to hers by the solemn sanctions of\nchurch and state.  Tryon was not a devout man, but he thanked God with\nreligious fervor that he had been saved a second time from a mistake\nwhich would have wrecked his whole future. If he had yielded to the\nmomentary weakness of the past night,--the outcome of a sickly\nsentimentality to which he recognized now, in the light of reflection,\nthat he was entirely too prone,--he would have regretted it soon\nenough.  The black streak would have been sure to come out in some\nform, sooner or later, if not in the wife, then in her children.  He\nsaw clearly enough, in this hour of revulsion, that with his\ntemperament and training such a union could never have been happy. If\nall the world had been ignorant of the dark secret, it would always\nhave been in his own thoughts, or at least never far away.  Each fault\nof hers that the close daily association of husband and wife might\nreveal,--the most flawless of sweethearts do not pass scathless through\nthe long test of matrimony,--every wayward impulse of his children,\nevery defect of mind, morals, temper, or health, would have been\nascribed to the dark ancestral strain.  Happiness under such conditions\nwould have been impossible.\n\nWhen Tryon lay awake in the early morning, after a few brief hours of\nsleep, the business which had brought him to Patesville seemed, in the\ncold light of reason, so ridiculously inadequate that he felt almost\nashamed to have set up such a pretext for his journey.  The prospect,\ntoo, of meeting Dr. Green and his family, of having to explain his\nformer sudden departure, and of running a gauntlet of inquiry\nconcerning his marriage to the aristocratic Miss Warwick of South\nCarolina; the fear that some one at Patesville might have suspected a\nconnection between Rena's swoon and his own flight,--these\nconsiderations so moved this impressionable and impulsive young man\nthat he called a bell-boy, demanded an early breakfast, ordered his\nhorse, paid his reckoning, and started upon his homeward journey\nforthwith.  A certain distrust of his own sensibility, which he felt to\nbe curiously inconsistent with his most positive convictions, led him\nto seek the river bridge by a roundabout route which did not take him\npast the house where, a few hours before, he had seen the last fragment\nof his idol shattered beyond the hope of repair.\n\n\nThe party broke up at an early hour, since most of the guests were\nworking-people, and the travelers were to make an early start next day.\nAbout nine in the morning, Wain drove round to Mis' Molly's.  Rena's\ntrunk was strapped behind the buggy, and she set out, in the company of\nWain, for her new field of labor.  The school term was only two months\nin length, and she did not expect to return until its expiration.  Just\nbefore taking her seat in the buggy, Rena felt a sudden sinking of the\nheart.\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" she whispered, as they stood wrapped in a close embrace,\n\"I'm afraid to leave you.  I left you once, and it turned out so\nmiserably.\"\n\n\"It'll turn out better this time, honey,\" replied her mother\nsoothingly.  \"Good-by, child.  Take care of yo'self an' yo'r money, and\nwrite to yo'r mammy.\"\n\nOne kiss all round, and Rena was lifted into the buggy.  Wain seized\nthe reins, and under his skillful touch the pretty mare began to prance\nand curvet with restrained impatience.  Wain could not resist the\nopportunity to show off before the party, which included Mary B.'s\nentire family and several other neighbors, who had gathered to see the\ntravelers off.\n\n\"Good-by ter Patesville!  Good-by, folkses all!\" he cried, with a wave\nof his disengaged hand.\n\n\"Good-by, mother!  Good-by, all!\" cried Rena, as with tears in her\nheart and a brave smile on her face she left her home behind her for\nthe second time.\n\nWhen they had crossed the river bridge, the travelers came to a long\nstretch of rising ground, from the summit of which they could look back\nover the white sandy road for nearly a mile. Neither Rena nor her\ncompanion saw Frank Fowler behind the chinquapin bush at the foot of\nthe hill, nor the gaze of mute love and longing with which he watched\nthe buggy mount the long incline.  He had not been able to trust\nhimself to bid her farewell.  He had seen her go away once before with\nevery prospect of happiness, and come back, a dove with a wounded wing,\nto the old nest behind the cedars.  She was going away again, with a\nman whom he disliked and distrusted.  If she had met misfortune before,\nwhat were her prospects for happiness now?\n\nThe buggy paused at the top of the hill, and Frank, shading his eyes\nwith his hand, thought he could see her turn and look behind.  Look\nback, dear child, towards your home and those who love you!  For who\nknows more than this faithful worshiper what threads of the past Fate\nis weaving into your future, or whether happiness or misery lies before\nyou?\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nBALANCE ALL\n\nThe road to Sampson County lay for the most part over the pine-clad\nsandhills,--an alternation of gentle rises and gradual descents, with\nnow and then a swamp of greater or less extent.  Long stretches of the\nhighway led through the virgin forest, for miles unbroken by a clearing\nor sign of human habitation.\n\nThey traveled slowly, with frequent pauses in shady places, for the\nweather was hot.  The journey, made leisurely, required more than a\nday, and might with slight effort be prolonged into two.  They stopped\nfor the night at a small village, where Wain found lodging for Rena\nwith an acquaintance of his, and for himself with another, while a\nthird took charge of the horse, the accommodation for travelers being\nlimited.  Rena's appearance and manners were the subject of much\ncomment.  It was necessary to explain to several curious white people\nthat Rena was a woman of color.  A white woman might have driven with\nWain without attracting remark,--most white ladies had negro coachmen.\nThat a woman of Rena's complexion should eat at a negro's table, or\nsleep beneath a negro's roof, was a seeming breach of caste which only\nblack blood could excuse.  The explanation was never questioned.  No\nwhite person of sound mind would ever claim to be a negro.\n\nThey resumed their journey somewhat late in the morning.  Rena would\nwillingly have hastened, for she was anxious to plunge into her new\nwork; but Wain seemed disposed to prolong the pleasant drive, and\nbeguiled the way for a time with stories of wonderful things he had\ndone and strange experiences of a somewhat checkered career.  He was\nshrewd enough to avoid any subject which would offend a modest young\nwoman, but too obtuse to perceive that much of what he said would not\ncommend him to a person of refinement.  He made little reference to his\npossessions, concerning which so much had been said at Patesville; and\nthis reticence was a point in his favor.  If he had not been so much\nupon his guard and Rena so much absorbed by thoughts of her future\nwork, such a drive would have furnished a person of her discernment a\nvery fair measure of the man's character. To these distractions must be\nadded the entire absence of any idea that Wain might have amorous\ndesigns upon her; and any shortcomings of manners or speech were\nexcused by the broad mantle of charity which Rena in her new-found zeal\nfor the welfare of her people was willing to throw over all their\nfaults.  They were the victims of oppression; they were not responsible\nfor its results.\n\nToward the end of the second day, while nearing their destination, the\ntravelers passed a large white house standing back from the road at the\nfoot of a lane.  Around it grew widespreading trees and well-kept\nshrubbery.  The fences were in good repair.  Behind the house and\nacross the road stretched extensive fields of cotton and waving corn.\nThey had passed no other place that showed such signs of thrift and\nprosperity.\n\n\"Oh, what a lovely place!\" exclaimed Rena. \"That is yours, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No; we ain't got to my house yet,\" he answered.  \"Dat house b'longs\nter de riches' people roun' here.  Dat house is over in de nex' county.\nWe're right close to de line now.\"\n\nShortly afterwards they turned off from the main highway they had been\npursuing, and struck into a narrower road to the left.\n\n\"De main road,\" explained Wain, \"goes on to Clinton, 'bout five miles\ner mo' away.  Dis one we're turnin' inter now will take us to my place,\nwhich is 'bout three miles fu'ther on.  We'll git dere now in an hour\ner so.\"\n\nWain lived in an old plantation house, somewhat dilapidated, and\nsurrounded by an air of neglect and shiftlessness, but still preserving\na remnant of dignity in its outlines and comfort in its interior\narrangements.  Rena was assigned a large room on the second floor.  She\nwas somewhat surprised at the make-up of the household.  Wain's\nmother--an old woman, much darker than her son--kept house for him.  A\nsister with two children lived in the house.  The element of surprise\nlay in the presence of two small children left by Wain's wife, of whom\nRena now heard for the first time.  He had lost his wife, he informed\nRena sadly, a couple of years before.\n\n\"Yas, Miss Rena,\" she sighed, \"de Lawd give her, an' de Lawd tuck her\naway.  Blessed be de name er de Lawd.\"  He accompanied this sententious\nquotation with a wicked look from under his half-closed eyelids that\nRena did not see.\n\nThe following morning Wain drove her in his buggy over to the county\ntown, where she took the teacher's examination.  She was given a seat\nin a room with a number of other candidates for certificates, but the\nfact leaking out from some remark of Wain's that she was a colored\ngirl, objection was quietly made by several of the would-be teachers to\nher presence in the room, and she was requested to retire until the\nwhite teachers should have been examined.  An hour or two later she was\ngiven a separate examination, which she passed without difficulty.  The\nexaminer, a gentleman of local standing, was dimly conscious that she\nmight not have found her exclusion pleasant, and was especially polite.\nIt would have been strange, indeed, if he had not been impressed by her\nsweet face and air of modest dignity, which were all the more striking\nbecause of her social disability.  He fell into conversation with her,\nbecame interested in her hopes and aims, and very cordially offered to\nbe of service, if at any time he might, in connection with her school.\n\n\"You have the satisfaction,\" he said, \"of receiving the only\nfirst-grade certificate issued to-day. You might teach a higher grade\nof pupils than you will find at Sandy Run, but let us hope that you may\nin time raise them to your own level.\"\n\n\"Which I doubt very much,\" he muttered to himself, as she went away\nwith Wain.  \"What a pity that such a woman should be a nigger!  If she\nwere anything to me, though, I should hate to trust her anywhere near\nthat saddle-colored scoundrel.  He's a thoroughly bad lot, and will\nbear watching.\"\n\nRena, however, was serenely ignorant of any danger from the\naccommodating Wain.  Absorbed in her own thoughts and plans, she had\nnot sought to look beneath the surface of his somewhat overdone\npoliteness.  In a few days she began her work as teacher, and sought to\nforget in the service of others the dull sorrow that still gnawed at\nher heart.\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nTHE SCHOOLHOUSE IN THE WOODS\n\nBlanche Leary, closely observant of Tryon's moods, marked a decided\nchange in his manner after his return from his trip to Patesville.  His\nformer moroseness had given way to a certain defiant lightness, broken\nnow and then by an involuntary sigh, but maintained so well, on the\nwhole, that his mother detected no lapses whatever. The change was\ncharacterized by another feature agreeable to both the women:  Tryon\nshowed decidedly more interest than ever before in Miss Leary's\nsociety.  Within a week he asked her several times to play a selection\non the piano, displaying, as she noticed, a decided preference for gay\nand cheerful music, and several times suggesting a change when she\nchose pieces of a sentimental cast.  More than once, during the second\nweek after his return, he went out riding with her; she was a graceful\nhorsewoman, perfectly at home in the saddle, and appearing to advantage\nin a riding-habit. She was aware that Tryon watched her now and then,\nwith an eye rather critical than indulgent.\n\n\"He is comparing me with some other girl,\" she surmised.  \"I seem to\nstand the test very well. I wonder who the other is, and what was the\ntrouble?\"\n\nMiss Leary exerted all her powers to interest and amuse the man she had\nset out to win, and who seemed nearer than ever before.  Tryon, to his\npleased surprise, discovered in her mind depths that he had never\nsuspected.  She displayed a singular affinity for the tastes that were\nhis--he could not, of course, know how carefully she had studied them.\nThe old wound, recently reopened, seemed to be healing rapidly, under\nconditions more conducive than before to perfect recovery. No longer,\nindeed, was he pursued by the picture of Rena discovered and\nunmasked--this he had definitely banished from the realm of sentiment\nto that of reason.  The haunting image of Rena loving and beloved, amid\nthe harmonious surroundings of her brother's home, was not so readily\ndisplaced. Nevertheless, he reached in several weeks a point from which\nhe could consider her as one thinks of a dear one removed by the hand\nof death, or smitten by some incurable ailment of mind or body.\nErelong, he fondly believed, the recovery would be so far complete that\nhe could consign to the tomb of pleasant memories even the most\nthrilling episodes of his ill-starred courtship.\n\n\"George,\" said Mrs. Tryon one morning while her son was in this\ncheerful mood, \"I'm sending Blanche over to Major McLeod's to do an\nerrand for me.  Would you mind driving her over?  The road may be rough\nafter the storm last night, and Blanche has an idea that no one drives\nso well as you.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, mother, I'll be glad to drive Blanche over.  I want to see\nthe major myself.\"\n\nThey were soon bowling along between the pines, behind the handsome\nmare that had carried Tryon so well at the Clarence tournament.\nPresently he drew up sharply.\n\n\"A tree has fallen squarely across the road,\" he exclaimed.  \"We shall\nhave to turn back a little way and go around.\"\n\nThey drove back a quarter of a mile and turned into a by-road leading\nto the right through the woods.  The solemn silence of the pine forest\nis soothing or oppressive, according to one's mood. Beneath the cool\narcade of the tall, overarching trees a deep peace stole over Tryon's\nheart.  He had put aside indefinitely and forever an unhappy and\nimpossible love.  The pretty and affectionate girl beside him would\nmake an ideal wife.  Of her family and blood he was sure.  She was his\nmother's choice, and his mother had set her heart upon their marriage.\nWhy not speak to her now, and thus give himself the best possible\nprotection against stray flames of love?\n\n\"Blanche,\" he said, looking at her kindly.\n\n\"Yes, George?\"  Her voice was very gentle, and slightly tremulous.\nCould she have divined his thought?  Love is a great clairvoyant.\n\n\"Blanche, dear, I\"--\n\nA clatter of voices broke upon the stillness of the forest and\ninterrupted Tryon's speech.  A sudden turn to the left brought the\nbuggy to a little clearing, in the midst of which stood a small log\nschoolhouse.  Out of the schoolhouse a swarm of colored children were\nemerging, the suppressed energy of the school hour finding vent in\nvocal exercise of various sorts.  A group had already formed a ring,\nand were singing with great volume and vigor:--\n\n     \"Miss Jane, she loves sugar an' tea,\n       Miss Jane, she loves candy.\n       Miss Jane, she can whirl all around\n       An' kiss her love quite handy.\n\n             \"De oak grows tall,\n               De pine grows slim,\n               So rise you up, my true love,\n               An' let me come in.\"\n\n\n\"What a funny little darkey!\" exclaimed Miss Leary, pointing to a\ndiminutive lad who was walking on his hands, with his feet balanced in\nthe air. At sight of the buggy and its occupants this sable acrobat,\nstill retaining his inverted position, moved toward the newcomers, and,\nreversing himself with a sudden spring, brought up standing beside the\nbuggy.\n\n\"Hoddy, Mars Geo'ge!\" he exclaimed, bobbing his head and kicking his\nheel out behind in approved plantation style.\n\n\"Hello, Plato,\" replied the young man, \"what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Gwine ter school, Mars Geo'ge,\" replied the lad; \"larnin' ter read an'\nwrite, suh, lack de w'ite folks.\"\n\n\"Wat you callin' dat w'ite man marster fur?\" whispered a tall yellow\nboy to the acrobat addressed as Plato.  \"You don' b'long ter him no\nmo'; you're free, an' ain' got sense ernuff ter know it.\"\n\nTryon threw a small coin to Plato, and holding another in his hand\nsuggestively, smiled toward the tall yellow boy, who looked regretfully\nat the coin, but stood his ground; he would call no man master, not\neven for a piece of money.\n\nDuring this little colloquy, Miss Leary had kept her face turned toward\nthe schoolhouse.\n\n\"What a pretty girl!\" she exclaimed.  \"There,\" she added, as Tryon\nturned his head toward her, \"you are too late.  She has retired into\nher castle. Oh, Plato!\"\n\n\"Yas, missis,\" replied Plato, who was prancing round the buggy in great\nglee, on the strength of his acquaintance with the white folks.\n\n\"Is your teacher white?\"\n\n\"No, ma'm, she ain't w'ite; she's black.  She looks lack she's w'ite,\nbut she's black.\"\n\nTryon had not seen the teacher's face, but the incident had jarred the\nold wound; Miss Leary's description of the teacher, together with\nPlato's characterization, had stirred lightly sleeping memories.  He\nwas more or less abstracted during the remainder of the drive, and did\nnot recur to the conversation that had been interrupted by coming upon\nthe schoolhouse.\n\nThe teacher, glancing for a moment through the open door of the\nschoolhouse, had seen a handsome young lady staring at her,--Miss Leary\nhad a curiously intent look when she was interested in anything, with\nno intention whatever to be rude,--and beyond the lady the back and\nshoulder of a man, whose face was turned the other way.  There was a\nvague suggestion of something familiar about the equipage, but Rena\nshrank from this close scrutiny and withdrew out of sight before she\nhad had an opportunity to identify the vague resemblance to something\nshe had known.\n\nMiss Leary had missed by a hair's-breadth the psychological moment, and\nfelt some resentment toward the little negroes who had interrupted her\nlover's train of thought.  Negroes have caused a great deal of trouble\namong white people.  How deeply the shadow of the Ethiopian had fallen\nupon her own happiness, Miss Leary of course could not guess.\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nAN INTERESTING ACQUAINTANCE\n\nA few days later, Rena looked out of the window near her desk and saw a\nlow basket phaeton, drawn by a sorrel pony, driven sharply into the\nclearing and drawn up beside an oak sapling. The occupant of the\nphaeton, a tall, handsome, well-preserved lady in middle life, with\nslightly gray hair, alighted briskly from the phaeton, tied the pony to\nthe sapling with a hitching-strap, and advanced to the schoolhouse door.\n\nRena wondered who the lady might be.  She had a benevolent aspect,\nhowever, and came forward to the desk with a smile, not at all\nembarrassed by the wide-eyed inspection of the entire school.\n\n\"How do you do?\" she said, extending her hand to the teacher.  \"I live\nin the neighborhood and am interested in the colored people--a good\nmany of them once belonged to me.  I heard something of your school,\nand thought I should like to make your acquaintance.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you, indeed,\" murmured Rena respectfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the lady, \"I am not one of those who sit back and\nblame their former slaves because they were freed.  They are free\nnow,--it is all decided and settled,--and they ought to be taught\nenough to enable them to make good use of their freedom.  But really,\nmy dear,--you mustn't feel offended if I make a mistake,--I am going to\nask you something very personal.\"  She looked suggestively at the\ngaping pupils.\n\n\"The school may take the morning recess now,\" announced the teacher.\nThe pupils filed out in an orderly manner, most of them stationing\nthemselves about the grounds in such places as would keep the teacher\nand the white lady in view.  Very few white persons approved of the\ncolored schools; no other white person had ever visited this one.\n\n\"Are you really colored?\" asked the lady, when the children had\nwithdrawn.\n\nA year and a half earlier, Rena would have met the question by some\ndisplay of self-consciousness. Now, she replied simply and directly.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I am colored.\"\n\nThe lady, who had been studying her as closely as good manners would\npermit, sighed regretfully.\n\n\"Well, it's a shame.  No one would ever think it.  If you chose to\nconceal it, no one would ever be the wiser.  What is your name, child,\nand where were you brought up?  You must have a romantic history.\"\n\nRena gave her name and a few facts in regard to her past.  The lady was\nso much interested, and put so many and such searching questions, that\nRena really found it more difficult to suppress the fact that she had\nbeen white, than she had formerly had in hiding her African origin.\nThere was about the girl an air of real refinement that pleased the\nlady,--the refinement not merely of a fine nature, but of contact with\ncultured people; a certain reserve of speech and manner quite\ninconsistent with Mrs. Tryon's experience of colored women.  The lady\nwas interested and slightly mystified.  A generous, impulsive\nspirit,--her son's own mother,--she made minute inquiries about the\nschool and the pupils, several of whom she knew by name.  Rena stated\nthat the two months' term was nearing its end, and that she was\ntraining the children in various declamations and dialogues for the\nexhibition at the close.\n\n\"I shall attend it,\" declared the lady positively. \"I'm sure you are\ndoing a good work, and it's very noble of you to undertake it when you\nmight have a very different future.  If I can serve you at any time,\ndon't hesitate to call upon me.  I live in the big white house just\nbefore you turn out of the Clinton road to come this way.  I'm only a\nwidow, but my son George lives with me and has some influence in the\nneighborhood.  He drove by here yesterday with the lady he is going to\nmarry.  It was she who told me about you.\"\n\nWas it the name, or some subtle resemblance in speech or feature, that\nrecalled Tryon's image to Rena's mind?  It was not so far away--the\nimage of the loving Tryon--that any powerful witchcraft was required to\ncall it up.  His mother was a widow; Rena had thought, in happier days,\nthat she might be such a kind lady as this.  But the cruel Tryon who\nhad left her--his mother would be some hard, cold, proud woman, who\nwould regard a negro as but little better than a dog, and who would not\nsoil her lips by addressing a colored person upon any other terms than\nas a servant.  She knew, too, that Tryon did not live in Sampson\nCounty, though the exact location of his home was not clear to her.\n\n\"And where are you staying, my dear?\" asked the good lady.\n\n\"I'm boarding at Mrs. Wain's,\" answered Rena.\n\n\"Mrs. Wain's?\"\n\n\"Yes, they live in the old Campbell place.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--Aunt Nancy.  She's a good enough woman, but we don't think\nmuch of her son Jeff. He married my Amanda after the war--she used to\nbelong to me, and ought to have known better. He abused her most\nshamefully, and had to be threatened with the law.  She left him a year\nor so ago and went away; I haven't seen her lately. Well, good-by,\nchild; I'm coming to your exhibition.  If you ever pass my house, come\nin and see me.\"\n\nThe good lady had talked for half an hour, and had brought a ray of\nsunshine into the teacher's monotonous life, heretofore lighted only by\nthe uncertain lamp of high resolve.  She had satisfied a pardonable\ncuriosity, and had gone away without mentioning her name.\n\nRena saw Plato untying the pony as the lady climbed into the phaeton.\n\n\"Who was the lady, Plato?\" asked the teacher when the visitor had\ndriven away.\n\n\"Dat 'uz my ole mist'iss, ma'm,\" returned Plato proudly,--\"ole Mis'\n'Liza.\"\n\n\"Mis' 'Liza who?\" asked Rena.\n\n\"Mis' 'Liza Tryon.  I use' ter b'long ter her. Dat 'uz her son, my\nyoung Mars Geo'ge, w'at driv pas' hyuh yistiddy wid 'is sweetheart.\"\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nTHE LOST KNIFE\n\nRena had found her task not a difficult one so far as discipline was\nconcerned.  Her pupils were of a docile race, and school to them had\nall the charm of novelty.  The teacher commanded some awe because she\nwas a stranger, and some, perhaps, because she was white; for the\ntheory of blackness as propounded by Plato could not quite\ncounter-balance in the young African mind the evidence of their own\nsenses.  She combined gentleness with firmness; and if these had not\nbeen sufficient, she had reserves of character which would have given\nher the mastery over much less plastic material than these ignorant but\neager young people. The work of instruction was simple enough, for most\nof the pupils began with the alphabet, which they acquired from\nWebster's blue-backed spelling-book, the palladium of Southern\neducation at that epoch.  The much abused carpet-baggers had put the\nspelling-book within reach of every child of school age in North\nCarolina,--a fact which is often overlooked when the carpet-baggers are\nheld up to public odium.  Even the devil should have his due, and is\nnot so black as he is painted.\n\nAt the time when she learned that Tryon lived in the neighborhood, Rena\nhad already been subjected for several weeks to a trying ordeal.  Wain\nhad begun to persecute her with marked attentions. She had at first\ngone to board at his house,--or, by courtesy, with his mother.  For a\nweek or two she had considered his attentions in no other light than\nthose of a member of the school committee sharing her own zeal and\ninterested in seeing the school successfully carried on.  In this\ncharacter Wain had driven her to the town for her examination; he had\nbusied himself about putting the schoolhouse in order, and in various\nmatters affecting the conduct of the school.  He had jocularly offered\nto come and whip the children for her, and had found it convenient to\ndrop in occasionally, ostensibly to see what progress the work was\nmaking.\n\n\"Dese child'en,\" he would observe sonorously, in the presence of the\nschool, \"oughter be monst'ous glad ter have de chance er settin' under\nyo' instruction, Miss Rena.  I'm sho' eve'body in dis neighbo'hood\n'preciates de priv'lege er havin' you in ou' mids'.\"\n\nThough slightly embarrassing to the teacher, these public\ndemonstrations were endurable so long as they could be regarded as mere\nofficial appreciation of her work.  Sincerely in earnest about her\nundertaking, she had plunged into it with all the intensity of a\nserious nature which love had stirred to activity.  A pessimist might\nhave sighed sadly or smiled cynically at the notion that a poor, weak\ngirl, with a dangerous beauty and a sensitive soul, and troubles enough\nof her own, should hope to accomplish anything appreciable toward\nlifting the black mass still floundering in the mud where slavery had\nleft it, and where emancipation had found it,--the mud in which, for\naught that could be seen to the contrary, her little feet, too, were\nhopelessly entangled.  It might have seemed like expecting a man to\nlift himself by his boot-straps.\n\nBut Rena was no philosopher, either sad or cheerful.  She could not\neven have replied to this argument, that races must lift themselves,\nand the most that can be done by others is to give them opportunity and\nfair play.  Hers was a simpler reasoning,--the logic by which the world\nis kept going onward and upward when philosophers are at odds and\nreformers are not forthcoming.  She knew that for every child she\ntaught to read and write she opened, if ever so little, the door of\nopportunity, and she was happy in the consciousness of performing a\nduty which seemed all the more imperative because newly discovered.\nHer zeal, indeed, for the time being was like that of an early\nChristian, who was more willing than not to die for his faith.  Rena\nhad fully and firmly made up her mind to sacrifice her life upon this\naltar.  Her absorption in the work had not been without its reward, for\nthereby she had been able to keep at a distance the spectre of her lost\nlove.  Her dreams she could not control, but she banished Tryon as far\nas possible from her waking thoughts.\n\nWhen Wain's attentions became obviously personal, Rena's new vestal\ninstinct took alarm, and she began to apprehend his character more\nclearly. She had long ago learned that his pretensions to wealth were a\nsham.  He was nominal owner of a large plantation, it is true; but the\nland was worn out, and mortgaged to the limit of its security value.\nHis reputed droves of cattle and hogs had dwindled to a mere handful of\nlean and listless brutes.\n\nHer clear eye, when once set to take Wain's measure, soon fathomed his\nshallow, selfish soul, and detected, or at least divined, behind his\nmask of good-nature a lurking brutality which filled her with vague\ndistrust, needing only occasion to develop it into active\napprehension,--occasion which was not long wanting.  She avoided being\nalone with him at home by keeping carefully with the women of the\nhouse.  If she were left alone,--and they soon showed a tendency to\nleave her on any pretext whenever Wain came near,--she would seek her\nown room and lock the door.  She preferred not to offend Wain; she was\nfar away from home and in a measure in his power, but she dreaded his\ncompliments and sickened at his smile.  She was also compelled to hear\nhis relations sing his praises.\n\n\"My son Jeff,\" old Mrs. Wain would say, \"is de bes' man you ever seed.\nHis fus' wife had de easies' time an' de happies' time er ary woman in\ndis settlement.  He's grieve' fer her a long time, but I reckon he's\ngittin' over it, an' de nex' 'oman w'at marries him'll git a box er\npyo' gol', ef I does say it as is his own mammy.\"\n\nRena had thought Wain rather harsh with his household, except in her\nimmediate presence.  His mother and sister seemed more or less afraid\nof him, and the children often anxious to avoid him.\n\nOne day, he timed his visit to the schoolhouse so as to walk home with\nRena through the woods. When she became aware of his purpose, she\ncalled to one of the children who was loitering behind the others,\n\"Wait a minute, Jenny.  I'm going your way, and you can walk along with\nme.\"\n\nWain with difficulty hid a scowl behind a smiling front.  When they had\ngone a little distance along the road through the woods, he clapped his\nhand upon his pocket.\n\n\"I declare ter goodness,\" he exclaimed, \"ef I ain't dropped my\npocket-knife!  I thought I felt somethin' slip th'ough dat hole in my\npocket jes' by the big pine stump in the schoolhouse ya'd. Jinny,\nchile, run back an' hunt fer my knife, an' I'll give yer five cents ef\nyer find it.  Me an' Miss Rena'll walk on slow 'tel you ketches us.\"\n\nRena did not dare to object, though she was afraid to be alone with\nthis man.  If she could have had a moment to think, she would have\nvolunteered to go back with Jenny and look for the knife, which,\nalthough a palpable subterfuge on her part, would have been one to\nwhich Wain could not object; but the child, dazzled by the prospect of\nreward, had darted back so quickly that this way of escape was cut off.\nShe was evidently in for a declaration of love, which she had taken\ninfinite pains to avoid.  Just the form it would assume, she could not\nforesee.  She was not long left in suspense. No sooner was the child\nwell out of sight than Wain threw his arms suddenly about her waist and\nsmilingly attempted to kiss her.\n\nSpeechless with fear and indignation, she tore herself from his grasp\nwith totally unexpected force, and fled incontinently along the forest\npath. Wain--who, to do him justice, had merely meant to declare his\npassion in what he had hoped might prove a not unacceptable\nfashion--followed in some alarm, expostulating and apologizing as he\nwent.  But he was heavy and Rena was light, and fear lent wings to her\nfeet.  He followed her until he saw her enter the house of Elder\nJohnson, the father of several of her pupils, after which he sneaked\nuneasily homeward, somewhat apprehensive of the consequences of his\nabrupt wooing, which was evidently open to an unfavorable construction.\nWhen, an hour later, Rena sent one of the Johnson children for some of\nher things, with a message explaining that the teacher had been invited\nto spend a few days at Elder Johnson's, Wain felt a pronounced measure\nof relief.  For an hour he had even thought it might be better to\nrelinquish his pursuit.  With a fatuousness born of vanity, however, no\nsooner had she sent her excuse than he began to look upon her visit to\nJohnson's as a mere exhibition of coyness, which, together with her\nconduct in the woods, was merely intended to lure him on.\n\nRight upon the heels of the perturbation caused by Wain's conduct, Rena\ndiscovered that Tryon lived in the neighborhood; that not only might\nshe meet him any day upon the highway, but that he had actually driven\nby the schoolhouse.  That he knew or would know of her proximity there\ncould be no possible doubt, since she had freely told his mother her\nname and her home.  A hot wave of shame swept over her at the thought\nthat George Tryon might imagine she were following him, throwing\nherself in his way, and at the thought of the construction which he\nmight place upon her actions. Caught thus between two emotional fires,\nat the very time when her school duties, owing to the approaching\nexhibition, demanded all her energies, Rena was subjected to a physical\nand mental strain that only youth and health could have resisted, and\nthen only for a short time.\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nPLATO EARNS HALF A DOLLAR\n\nTryon's first feeling, when his mother at the dinner-table gave an\naccount of her visit to the schoolhouse in the woods, was one of\nextreme annoyance.  Why, of all created beings, should this particular\nwoman be chosen to teach the colored school at Sandy Run?  Had she\nlearned that he lived in the neighborhood, and had she sought the place\nhoping that he might consent to renew, on different terms, relations\nwhich could never be resumed upon their former footing?  Six weeks\nbefore, he would not have believed her capable of following him; but\nhis last visit to Patesville had revealed her character in such a light\nthat it was difficult to predict what she might do.  It was, however,\nno affair of his.  He was done with her; he had dismissed her from his\nown life, where she had never properly belonged, and he had filled her\nplace, or would soon fill it, with another and worthier woman.  Even\nhis mother, a woman of keen discernment and delicate intuitions, had\nbeen deceived by this girl's specious exterior.  She had brought away\nfrom her interview of the morning the impression that Rena was a fine,\npure spirit, born out of place, through some freak of Fate, devoting\nherself with heroic self-sacrifice to a noble cause.  Well, he had\nimagined her just as pure and fine, and she had deliberately, with a\nnegro's low cunning, deceived him into believing that she was a white\ngirl.  The pretended confession of the brother, in which he had spoken\nof the humble origin of the family, had been, consciously or\nunconsciously, the most disingenuous feature of the whole miserable\nperformance.  They had tried by a show of frankness to satisfy their\nown consciences,--they doubtless had enough of white blood to give them\na rudimentary trace of such a moral organ,--and by the same act to\ndisarm him against future recriminations, in the event of possible\ndiscovery.  How was he to imagine that persons of their appearance and\npretensions were tainted with negro blood?  The more he dwelt upon the\nsubject, the more angry he became with those who had surprised his\nvirgin heart and deflowered it by such low trickery.  The man who\nbrought the first negro into the British colonies had committed a crime\nagainst humanity and a worse crime against his own race.  The father of\nthis girl had been guilty of a sin against society for which\nothers--for which he, George Tryon--must pay the penalty.  As slaves,\nnegroes were tolerable.  As freemen, they were an excrescence, an alien\nelement incapable of absorption into the body politic of white men.  He\nwould like to send them all back to the Africa from which their\nforefathers had come,--unwillingly enough, he would admit,--and he\nwould like especially to banish this girl from his own neighborhood;\nnot indeed that her presence would make any difference to him, except\nas a humiliating reminder of his own folly and weakness with which he\ncould very well dispense.\n\nOf this state of mind Tryon gave no visible manifestation beyond a\ncertain taciturnity, so much at variance with his recent liveliness\nthat the ladies could not fail to notice it.  No effort upon the part\nof either was able to affect his mood, and they both resigned\nthemselves to await his lordship's pleasure to be companionable.\n\nFor a day or two, Tryon sedulously kept away from the neighborhood of\nthe schoolhouse at Sandy Rim.  He really had business which would have\ntaken him in that direction, but made a detour of five miles rather\nthan go near his abandoned and discredited sweetheart.\n\nBut George Tryon was wisely distrustful of his own impulses.  Driving\none day along the road to Clinton, he overhauled a diminutive black\nfigure trudging along the road, occasionally turning a handspring by\nway of diversion.\n\n\"Hello, Plato,\" called Tryon, \"do you want a lift?\"\n\n\"Hoddy, Mars Geo'ge.  Kin I ride wid you?\"\n\n\"Jump up.\"\n\nPlato mounted into the buggy with the agility to be expected from a lad\nof his acrobatic accomplishments.  The two almost immediately fell into\nconversation upon perhaps the only subject of common interest between\nthem.  Before the town was reached, Tryon knew, so far as Plato could\nmake it plain, the estimation in which the teacher was held by pupils\nand parents.  He had learned the hours of opening and dismissal of the\nschool, where the teacher lived, her habits of coming to and going from\nthe schoolhouse, and the road she always followed.\n\n\"Does she go to church or anywhere else with Jeff Wain, Plato?\" asked\nTryon.\n\n\"No, suh, she don' go nowhar wid nobody excep'n' ole Elder Johnson er\nMis' Johnson, an' de child'en.  She use' ter stop at Mis' Wain's, but\nshe's stayin' wid Elder Johnson now.  She alluz makes some er de\nchild'en go home wid er f'm school,\" said Plato, proud to find in Mars\nGeo'ge an appreciative listener,--\"sometimes one an' sometimes anudder.\nI's be'n home wid 'er twice, ann it'll be my tu'n ag'in befo' long.\"\n\n\"Plato,\" remarked Tryon impressively, as they drove into the town, \"do\nyou think you could keep a secret?\"\n\n\"Yas, Mars Geo'ge, ef you says I shill.\"\n\n\"Do you see this fifty-cent piece?\"  Tryon displayed a small piece of\npaper money, crisp and green in its newness.\n\n\"Yas, Mars Geo'ge,\" replied Plato, fixing his eyes respectfully on the\ngovernment's promise to pay.  Fifty cents was a large sum of money.\nHis acquaintance with Mars Geo'ge gave him the privilege of looking at\nmoney.  When he grew up, he would be able, in good times, to earn fifty\ncents a day.\n\n\"I am going to give this to you, Plato.\"\n\nPlato's eyes opened wide as saucers.  \"Me, Mars Geo'ge?\" he asked in\namazement.\n\n\"Yes, Plato.  I'm going to write a letter while I'm in town, and want\nyou to take it.  Meet me here in half an hour, and I'll give you the\nletter. Meantime, keep your mouth shut.\"\n\n\"Yas, Mars Geo'ge,\" replied Plato with a grin that distended that organ\nunduly.  That he did not keep it shut may be inferred from the fact\nthat within the next half hour he had eaten and drunk fifty cents'\nworth of candy, ginger-pop, and other available delicacies that\nappealed to the youthful palate.  Having nothing more to spend, and the\nhigh prices prevailing for some time after the war having left him\ncapable of locomotion, Plato was promptly on hand at the appointed time\nand place.\n\nTryon placed a letter in Plato's hand, still sticky with molasses\ncandy,--he had inclosed it in a second cover by way of protection.\n\"Give that letter,\" he said, \"to your teacher; don't say a word about\nit to a living soul; bring me an answer, and give it into my own hand,\nand you shall have another half dollar.\"\n\nTryon was quite aware that by a surreptitious correspondence he ran\nsome risk of compromising Rena.  But he had felt, as soon as he had\nindulged his first opportunity to talk of her, an irresistible impulse\nto see her and speak to her again. He could scarcely call at her\nboarding-place,--what possible proper excuse could a young white man\nhave for visiting a colored woman?  At the schoolhouse she would be\nsurrounded by her pupils, and a private interview would be as\ndifficult, with more eyes to remark and more tongues to comment upon\nit.  He might address her by mail, but did not know how often she sent\nto the nearest post-office.  A letter mailed in the town must pass\nthrough the hands of a postmaster notoriously inquisitive and\nevil-minded, who was familiar with Tryon's handwriting and had ample\ntime to attend to other people's business.  To meet the teacher alone\non the road seemed scarcely feasible, according to Plato's statement.\nA messenger, then, was not only the least of several evils, but really\nthe only practicable way to communicate with Rena. He thought he could\ntrust Plato, though miserably aware that he could not trust himself\nwhere this girl was concerned.\n\nThe letter handed by Tryon to Plato, and by the latter delivered with\ndue secrecy and precaution, ran as follows:--\n\n\nDEAR MISS WARWICK,--You may think it strange that I should address you\nafter what has passed between us; but learning from my mother of your\npresence in the neighborhood, I am constrained to believe that you do\nnot find my proximity embarrassing, and I cannot resist the wish to\nmeet you at least once more, and talk over the circumstances of our\nformer friendship.  From a practical point of view this may seem\nsuperfluous, as the matter has been definitely settled.  I have no\ndesire to find fault with you; on the contrary, I wish to set myself\nright with regard to my own actions, and to assure you of my good\nwishes.  In other words, since we must part, I would rather we parted\nfriends than enemies.  If nature and society--or Fate, to put it\nanother way--have decreed that we cannot live together, it is\nnevertheless possible that we may carry into the future a pleasant\nthough somewhat sad memory of a past friendship. Will you not grant me\none interview?  I appreciate the difficulty of arranging it; I have\nfound it almost as hard to communicate with you by letter.  I will suit\nmyself to your convenience and meet you at any time and place you may\ndesignate.  Please answer by bearer, who I think is trustworthy, and\nbelieve me, whatever your answer may be,\n\n             Respectfully yours,\n                              G. T.\n\n\nThe next day but one Tryon received through the mail the following\nreply to his letter:--\n\n\nGEORGE TRYON, ESQ.\n\nDear Sir,--I have requested your messenger to say that I will answer\nyour letter by mail, which I shall now proceed to do.  I assure you\nthat I was entirely ignorant of your residence in this neighborhood, or\nit would have been the last place on earth in which I should have set\nfoot.\n\nAs to our past relations, they were ended by your own act.  I frankly\nconfess that I deceived you; I have paid the penalty, and have no\ncomplaint to make.  I appreciate the delicacy which has made you\nrespect my brother's secret, and thank you for it.  I remember the\nwhole affair with shame and humiliation, and would willingly forget it.\n\nAs to a future interview, I do not see what good it would do either of\nus.  You are white, and you have given me to understand that I am\nblack. I accept the classification, however unfair, and the\nconsequences, however unjust, one of which is that we cannot meet in\nthe same parlor, in the same church, at the same table, or anywhere, in\nsocial intercourse; upon a steamboat we would not sit at the same\ntable; we could not walk together on the street, or meet publicly\nanywhere and converse, without unkind remark.  As a white man, this\nmight not mean a great deal to you; as a woman, shut out already by my\ncolor from much that is desirable, my good name remains my most\nvaluable possession.  I beg of you to let me alone. The best possible\nproof you can give me of your good wishes is to relinquish any desire\nor attempt to see me.  I shall have finished my work here in a few\ndays.  I have other troubles, of which you know nothing, and any\nmeeting with you would only add to a burden which is already as much as\nI can bear.  To speak of parting is superfluous--we have already\nparted.  It were idle to dream of a future friendship between people so\nwidely different in station.  Such a friendship, if possible in itself,\nwould never be tolerated by the lady whom you are to marry, with whom\nyou drove by my schoolhouse the other day.  A gentleman so loyal to his\nrace and its traditions as you have shown yourself could not be less\nfaithful to the lady to whom he has lost his heart and his memory in\nthree short months.\n\nNo, Mr. Tryon, our romance is ended, and better so.  We could never\nhave been happy.  I have found a work in which I may be of service to\nothers who have fewer opportunities than mine have been.  Leave me in\npeace, I beseech you, and I shall soon pass out of your neighborhood as\nI have passed out of your life, and hope to pass out of your memory.\n\n             Yours very truly,\n                    ROWENA WALDEN.\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nAN UNUSUAL HONOR\n\nTo Rena's high-strung and sensitive nature, already under very great\ntension from her past experience, the ordeal of the next few days was a\nsevere one.  On the one hand, Jeff Wain's infatuation had rapidly\nincreased, in view of her speedy departure.  From Mrs. Tryon's remark\nabout Wain's wife Amanda, and from things Rena had since learned, she\nhad every reason to believe that this wife was living, and that Wain\nmust be aware of the fact.  In the light of this knowledge, Wain's\nformer conduct took on a blacker significance than, upon reflection,\nshe had charitably clothed it with after the first flush of\nindignation.  That he had not given up his design to make love to her\nwas quite apparent, and, with Amanda alive, his attentions, always\noffensive since she had gathered their import, became in her eyes the\nexpression of a villainous purpose, of which she could not speak to\nothers, and from which she felt safe only so long as she took proper\nprecautions against it.  In a week her school would be over, and then\nshe would get Elder Johnson, or some one else than Wain, to take her\nback to Patesville.  True, she might abandon her school and go at once;\nbut her work would be incomplete, she would have violated her contract,\nshe would lose her salary for the month, explanations would be\nnecessary, and would not be forthcoming.  She might feign\nsickness,--indeed, it would scarcely be feigning, for she felt far from\nwell; she had never, since her illness, quite recovered her former\nvigor--but the inconvenience to others would be the same, and her\nself-sacrifice would have had, at its very first trial, a lame and\nimpotent conclusion.  She had as yet no fear of personal violence from\nWain; but, under the circumstances, his attentions were an insult.  He\nwas evidently bent upon conquest, and vain enough to think he might\nachieve it by virtue of his personal attractions.  If he could have\nunderstood how she loathed the sight of his narrow eyes, with their\npuffy lids, his thick, tobacco-stained lips, his doubtful teeth, and\nhis unwieldy person, Wain, a monument of conceit that he was, might\nhave shrunk, even in his own estimation, to something like his real\nproportions.  Rena believed that, to defend herself from persecution at\nhis hands, it was only necessary that she never let him find her alone.\nThis, however, required constant watchfulness. Relying upon his own\npowers, and upon a woman's weakness and aversion to scandal, from which\nnot even the purest may always escape unscathed, and convinced by her\nformer silence that he had nothing serious to fear, Wain made it a\npoint to be present at every public place where she might be.  He\nassumed, in conversation with her which she could not avoid, and stated\nto others, that she had left his house because of a previous promise to\ndivide the time of her stay between Elder Johnson's house and his own.\nHe volunteered to teach a class in the Sunday-school which Rena\nconducted at the colored Methodist church, and when she remained to\nservice, occupied a seat conspicuously near her own.  In addition to\nthese public demonstrations, which it was impossible to escape, or, it\nseemed, with so thick-skinned an individual as Wain, even to\ndiscourage, she was secretly and uncomfortably conscious that she could\nscarcely stir abroad without the risk of encountering one of two men,\neach of whom was on the lookout for an opportunity to find her alone.\n\nThe knowledge of Tryon's presence in the vicinity had been almost as\nmuch as Rena could bear.  To it must be added the consciousness that\nhe, too, was pursuing her, to what end she could not tell.  After his\nletter to her brother, and the feeling therein displayed, she found it\nnecessary to crush once or twice a wild hope that, her secret being\nstill unknown save to a friendly few, he might return and claim her.\nNow, such an outcome would be impossible.  He had become engaged to\nanother woman,--this in itself would be enough to keep him from her, if\nit were not an index of a vastly more serious barrier, a proof that he\nhad never loved her.  If he had loved her truly, he would never have\nforgotten her in three short months,--three long months they had\nheretofore seemed to her, for in them she had lived a lifetime of\nexperience.  Another impassable barrier lay in the fact that his mother\nhad met her, and that she was known in the neighborhood.  Thus cut off\nfrom any hope that she might be anything to him, she had no wish to\nmeet her former lover; no possible good could come of such a meeting;\nand yet her fluttering heart told her that if he should come, as his\nletter foreshadowed that he might,--if he should come, the loving\nGeorge of old, with soft words and tender smiles and specious talk of\nfriendship--ah! then, her heart would break!  She must not meet him--at\nany cost she must avoid him.\n\nBut this heaping up of cares strained her endurance to the\nbreaking-point.  Toward the middle of the last week, she knew that she\nhad almost reached the limit, and was haunted by a fear that she might\nbreak down before the week was over.  Now her really fine nature rose\nto the emergency, though she mustered her forces with a great effort.\nIf she could keep Wain at his distance and avoid Tryon for three days\nlonger, her school labors would be ended and she might retire in peace\nand honor.\n\n\"Miss Rena,\" said Plato to her on Tuesday, \"ain't it 'bout time I wuz\ngwine home wid you ag'in?\"\n\n\"You may go with me to-morrow, Plato,\" answered the teacher.\n\nAfter school Plato met an anxious eyed young man in the woods a short\ndistance from the schoolhouse.\n\n\"Well, Plato, what news?\"\n\n\"I's gwine ter see her home ter-morrer, Mars Geo'ge.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\" replied Tryon; \"how very fortunate!  I wanted you to go to\ntown to-morrow to take an important message for me.  I'm sorry,\nPlato--you might have earned another dollar.\"\n\nTo lie is a disgraceful thing, and yet there are times when, to a\nlover's mind, love dwarfs all ordinary laws.  Plato scratched his head\ndisconsolately, but suddenly a bright thought struck him.\n\n\"Can't I go ter town fer you atter I've seed her home, Mars Geo'ge?\"\n\n\"N-o, I'm afraid it would be too late,\" returned Tryon doubtfully.\n\n\"Den I'll haf ter ax 'er ter lemme go nex' day,\" said Plato, with\nresignation.  The honor might be postponed or, if necessary, foregone;\nthe opportunity to earn a dollar was the chance of a lifetime and must\nnot be allowed to slip.\n\n\"No, Plato,\" rejoined Tryon, shaking his head, \"I shouldn't want to\ndeprive you of so great a pleasure.\"  Tryon was entirely sincere in\nthis characterization of Plato's chance; he would have given many a\ndollar to be sure of Plato's place and Plato's welcome.  Rena's letter\nhad re-inflamed his smouldering passion; only opposition was needed to\nfan it to a white heat.  Wherein lay the great superiority of his\nposition, if he was denied the right to speak to the one person in the\nworld whom he most cared to address?  He felt some dim realization of\nthe tyranny of caste, when he found it not merely pressing upon an\ninferior people who had no right to expect anything better, but barring\nhis own way to something that he desired.  He meant her no harm--but he\nmust see her.  He could never marry her now--but he must see her. He\nwas conscious of a certain relief at the thought that he had not asked\nBlanche Leary to be his wife.  His hand was unpledged.  He could not\nmarry the other girl, of course, but they must meet again.  The rest he\nwould leave to Fate, which seemed reluctant to disentangle threads\nwhich it had woven so closely.\n\n\"I think, Plato, that I see an easier way out of the difficulty.  Your\nteacher, I imagine, merely wants some one to see her safely home.\nDon't you think, if you should go part of the way, that I might take\nyour place for the rest, while you did my errand?\"\n\n\"Why, sho'ly, Mars Geo'ge, you could take keer er her better 'n I\ncould--better 'n anybody could--co'se you could!\"\n\nMars Geo'ge was white and rich, and could do anything.  Plato was proud\nof the fact that he had once belonged to Mars Geo'ge.  He could not\nconceive of any one so powerful as Mars Geo'ge, unless it might be God,\nof whom Plato had heard more or less, and even here the comparison\nmight not be quite fair to Mars Geo'ge, for Mars Geo'ge was the younger\nof the two.  It would undoubtedly be a great honor for the teacher to\nbe escorted home by Mars Geo'ge.  The teacher was a great woman, no\ndoubt, and looked white; but Mars Geo'ge was the real article.  Mars\nGeo'ge had never been known to go with a black woman before, and the\nteacher would doubtless thank Plato for arranging that so great an\nhonor should fall upon her.  Mars Geo'ge had given him fifty cents\ntwice, and would now give him a dollar. Noble Mars Geo'ge! Fortunate\nteacher!  Happy Plato!\n\n\"Very well, Plato.  I think we can arrange it so that you can kill the\ntwo rabbits at one shot. Suppose that we go over the road that she will\ntake to go home.\"\n\nThey soon arrived at the schoolhouse.  School had been out an hour, and\nthe clearing was deserted.  Plato led the way by the road through the\nwoods to a point where, amid somewhat thick underbrush, another path\nintersected the road they were following.\n\n\"Now, Plato,\" said Tryon, pausing here, \"this would be a good spot for\nyou to leave the teacher and for me to take your place.  This path\nleads to the main road, and will take you to town very quickly.  I\nshouldn't say anything to the teacher about it at all; but when you and\nshe get here, drop behind and run along this path until you meet\nme,--I'll be waiting a few yards down the road,--and then run to town\nas fast as your legs will carry you.  As soon as you are gone, I'll\ncome out and tell the teacher that I've sent you away on an errand, and\nwill myself take your place.  You shall have a dollar, and I'll ask her\nto let you go home with her the next day.  But you mustn't say a word\nabout it, Plato, or you won't get the dollar, and I'll not ask the\nteacher to let you go home with her again.\"\n\n\"All right, Mars Geo'ge, I ain't gwine ter say no mo' d'n ef de cat had\nmy tongue.\"\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\nIN DEEP WATERS\n\nRena was unusually fatigued at the close of her school on Wednesday\nafternoon.  She had been troubled all day with a headache, which,\nbeginning with a dull pain, had gradually increased in intensity until\nevery nerve was throbbing like a trip-hammer. The pupils seemed\nunusually stupid.  A discouraging sense of the insignificance of any\npart she could perform towards the education of three million people\nwith a school term of two months a year hung over her spirit like a\npall.  As the object of Wain's attentions, she had begun to feel\nsomewhat like a wild creature who hears the pursuers on its track, and\nhas the fear of capture added to the fatigue of flight.  But when this\nexcitement had gone too far and had neared the limit of exhaustion came\nTryon's letter, with the resulting surprise and consternation.  Rena\nhad keyed herself up to a heroic pitch to answer it; but when the\ninevitable reaction came, she was overwhelmed with a sickening sense of\nher own weakness.  The things which in another sphere had constituted\nher strength and shield were now her undoing, and exposed her to\ndangers from which they lent her no protection.  Not only was this her\nposition in theory, but the pursuers were already at her heels. As the\nday wore on, these dark thoughts took on an added gloom, until, when\nthe hour to dismiss school arrived, she felt as though she had not a\nfriend in the world.  This feeling was accentuated by a letter which\nshe had that morning received from her mother, in which Mis' Molly\nspoke very highly of Wain, and plainly expressed the hope that her\ndaughter might like him so well that she would prefer to remain in\nSampson County.\n\nPlato, bright-eyed and alert, was waiting in the school-yard until the\nteacher should be ready to start.  Having warned away several smaller\nchildren who had hung around after school as though to share his\nprerogative of accompanying the teacher, Plato had swung himself into\nthe low branches of an oak at the edge of the clearing, from which he\nwas hanging by his legs, head downward.  He dropped from this reposeful\nattitude when the teacher appeared at the door, and took his place at\nher side.\n\nA premonition of impending trouble caused the teacher to hesitate.  She\nwished that she had kept more of the pupils behind.  Something\nwhispered that danger lurked in the road she customarily followed.\nPlato seemed insignificantly small and weak, and she felt miserably\nunable to cope with any difficult or untoward situation.\n\n\"Plato,\" she suggested, \"I think we'll go round the other way to-night,\nif you don't mind.\"\n\nVisions of Mars Geo'ge disappointed, of a dollar unearned and unspent,\nflitted through the narrow brain which some one, with the irony of\nignorance or of knowledge, had mocked with the name of a great\nphilosopher.  Plato was not an untruthful lad, but he seldom had the\nopportunity to earn a dollar.  His imagination, spurred on by the\ninstinct of self-interest, rose to the emergency.\n\n\"I's feared you mought git snake-bit gwine roun' dat way, Miss Rena.\nMy brer Jim kill't a water-moccasin down dere yistiddy 'bout ten feet\nlong.\"\n\nRena had a horror of snakes, with which the swamp by which the other\nroad ran was infested. Snakes were a vivid reality; her presentiment\nwas probably a mere depression of spirits due to her condition of\nnervous exhaustion.  A cloud had come up and threatened rain, and the\nwind was rising ominously.  The old way was the shorter; she wanted\nabove all things to get to Elder Johnson's and go to bed.  Perhaps\nsleep would rest her tired brain--she could not imagine herself feeling\nworse, unless she should break down altogether.\n\nShe plunged into the path and hastened forward so as to reach home\nbefore the approaching storm.  So completely was she absorbed in her\nown thoughts that she scarcely noticed that Plato himself seemed\npreoccupied.  Instead of capering along like a playful kitten or puppy,\nhe walked by her side unusually silent.  When they had gone a short\ndistance and were approaching a path which intersected their road at\nsomething near a right angle, the teacher missed Plato.  He had dropped\nbehind a moment before; now he had disappeared entirely.  Her vague\nalarm of a few moments before returned with redoubled force.\n\n\"Plato!\" she called; \"Plato!\"\n\nThere was no response, save the soughing of the wind through the\nswaying treetops.  She stepped hastily forward, wondering if this were\nsome childish prank.  If so, it was badly timed, and she would let\nPlato feel the weight of her displeasure.\n\nHer forward step had brought her to the junction of the two paths,\nwhere she paused doubtfully.  The route she had been following was the\nmost direct way home, but led for quite a distance through the forest,\nwhich she did not care to traverse alone.  The intersecting path would\nsoon take her to the main road, where she might find shelter or\ncompany, or both.  Glancing around again in search of her missing\nescort, she became aware that a man was approaching her from each of\nthe two paths.  In one she recognized the eager and excited face of\nGeorge Tryon, flushed with anticipation of their meeting, and yet grave\nwith uncertainty of his reception.  Advancing confidently along the\nother path she saw the face of Jeff Wain, drawn, as she imagined in her\nanguish, with evil passions which would stop at nothing.\n\nWhat should she do?  There was no sign of Plato--for aught she could\nsee or hear of him, the earth might have swallowed him up.  Some deadly\nserpent might have stung him.  Some wandering rabbit might have tempted\nhim aside. Another thought struck her.  Plato had been very\nquiet--there had been something on his conscience--perhaps he had\nbetrayed her!  But to which of the two men, and to what end?\n\nThe problem was too much for her overwrought brain.  She turned and\nfled.  A wiser instinct might have led her forward.  In the two\nconflicting dangers she might have found safety.  The road after all\nwas a public way.  Any number of persons might meet there accidentally.\nBut she saw only the darker side of the situation.  To turn to Tryon\nfor protection before Wain had by some overt act manifested the evil\npurpose which she as yet only suspected would be, she imagined, to\nacknowledge a previous secret acquaintance with Tryon, thus placing her\nreputation at Wain's mercy, and to charge herself with a burden of\nobligation toward a man whom she wished to avoid and had refused to\nmeet.  If, on the other hand, she should go forward to meet Wain, he\nwould undoubtedly offer to accompany her homeward. Tryon would\ninevitably observe the meeting, and suppose it prearranged.  Not for\nthe world would she have him think so--why she should care for his\nopinion, she did not stop to argue.  She turned and fled, and to avoid\npossible pursuit, struck into the underbrush at an angle which she\ncalculated would bring her in a few rods to another path which would\nlead quickly into the main road.  She had run only a few yards when she\nfound herself in the midst of a clump of prickly shrubs and briars.\nMeantime the storm had burst; the rain fell in torrents.  Extricating\nherself from the thorns, she pressed forward, but instead of coming out\nupon the road, found herself penetrating deeper and deeper into the\nforest.\n\nThe storm increased in violence.  The air grew darker and darker.  It\nwas near evening, the clouds were dense, the thick woods increased the\ngloom.  Suddenly a blinding flash of lightning pierced the darkness,\nfollowed by a sharp clap of thunder.  There was a crash of falling\ntimber. Terror-stricken, Rena flew forward through the forest, the\nunderbrush growing closer and closer as she advanced.  Suddenly the\nearth gave way beneath her feet and she sank into a concealed morass.\nBy clasping the trunk of a neighboring sapling she extricated herself\nwith an effort, and realized with a horrible certainty that she was\nlost in the swamp.\n\nTurning, she tried to retrace her steps.  A flash of lightning\npenetrated the gloom around her, and barring her path she saw a huge\nblack snake,--harmless enough, in fact, but to her excited imagination\nfrightful in appearance.  With a wild shriek she turned again,\nstaggered forward a few yards, stumbled over a projecting root, and\nfell heavily to the earth.\n\nWhen Rena had disappeared in the underbrush, Tryon and Wain had each\ninstinctively set out in pursuit of her, but owing to the gathering\ndarkness, the noise of the storm, and the thickness of the underbrush,\nthey missed not only Rena but each other, and neither was aware of the\nother's presence in the forest.  Wain kept up the chase until the rain\ndrove him to shelter.  Tryon, after a few minutes, realized that she\nhad fled to escape him, and that to pursue her would be to defeat\nrather than promote his purpose.  He desisted, therefore, and returning\nto the main road, stationed himself at a point where he could watch\nElder Johnson's house, and having waited for a while without any signs\nof Rena, concluded that she had taken refuge in some friendly cabin.\nTurning homeward disconsolately as night came on, he intercepted Plato\non his way back from town, and pledged him to inviolable secrecy so\neffectually that Plato, when subsequently questioned, merely answered\nthat he had stopped a moment to gather some chinquapins, and when he\nhad looked around the teacher was gone.\n\nRena not appearing at supper-time nor for an hour later, the elder,\nsomewhat anxious, made inquiries about the neighborhood, and finding\nhis guest at no place where she might be expected to stop, became\nsomewhat alarmed.  Wain's house was the last to which he went.  He had\nsurmised that there was some mystery connected with her leaving Wain's,\nbut had never been given any definite information about the matter.  In\nresponse to his inquiries, Wain expressed surprise, but betrayed a\ncertain self-consciousness which did not escape the elder's eye.\nReturning home, he organized a search party from his own family and\nseveral near neighbors, and set out with dogs and torches to scour the\nwoods for the missing teacher. A couple of hours later, they found her\nlying unconscious in the edge of the swamp, only a few rods from a\nwell-defined path which would soon have led her to the open highway.\nStrong arms lifted her gently and bore her home.  Mrs. Johnson\nundressed her and put her to bed, administering a homely remedy, of\nwhich whiskey was the principal ingredient, to counteract the effects\nof the exposure.  There was a doctor within five miles, but no one\nthought of sending for him, nor was it at all likely that it would have\nbeen possible to get him for such a case at such an hour.\n\nRena's illness, however, was more deeply seated than her friends could\nimagine.  A tired body, in sympathy with an overwrought brain, had left\nher peculiarly susceptible to the nervous shock of her forest\nexperience.  The exposure for several hours in her wet clothing to the\ndamps and miasma of the swamp had brought on an attack of brain fever.\nThe next morning, she was delirious.  One of the children took word to\nthe schoolhouse that the teacher was sick and there would be no school\nthat day.  A number of curious and sympathetic people came in from time\nto time and suggested various remedies, several of which old Mrs.\nJohnson, with catholic impartiality, administered to the helpless\nteacher, who from delirium gradually sunk into a heavy stupor scarcely\ndistinguishable from sleep.  It was predicted that she would probably\nbe well in the morning; if not, it would then be time to consider\nseriously the question of sending for a doctor.\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\nTHE POWER OF LOVE\n\nAfter Tryon's failure to obtain an interview with Rena through Plato's\nconnivance, he decided upon a different course of procedure.  In a few\ndays her school term would be finished.  He was not less desirous to\nsee her, was indeed as much more eager as opposition would be likely to\nmake a very young man who was accustomed to having his own way, and\nwhose heart, as he had discovered, was more deeply and permanently\ninvolved than he had imagined.  His present plan was to wait until the\nend of the school; then, when Rena went to Clinton on the Saturday or\nMonday to draw her salary for the month, he would see her in the town,\nor, if necessary, would follow her to Patesville.  No power on earth\nshould keep him from her long, but he had no desire to interfere in any\nway with the duty which she owed to others. When the school was over\nand her work completed, then he would have his innings.  Writing\nletters was too unsatisfactory a method of communication--he must see\nher face to face.\n\nThe first of his three days of waiting had passed, when, about ten\no'clock on the morning of the second day, which seemed very long in\nprospect, while driving along the road toward Clinton, he met Plato,\nwith a rabbit trap in his hand.\n\n\"Well, Plato,\" he asked, \"why are you absent from the classic shades of\nthe academy to-day?\"\n\n\"Hoddy, Mars Geo'ge.  W'at wuz dat you say?\"\n\n\"Why are you not at school to-day?\"\n\n\"Ain' got no teacher, Mars Geo'ge.  Teacher's gone!\"\n\n\"Gone!\" exclaimed Tryon, with a sudden leap of the heart.  \"Gone where?\nWhat do you mean?\"\n\n\"Teacher got los' in de swamp, night befo' las', 'cause Plato wa'n't\ndere ter show her de way out'n de woods.  Elder Johnson foun' 'er wid\ndawgs and tawches, an' fotch her home an' put her ter bed. No school\nyistiddy.  She wuz out'n her haid las' night, an' dis mawnin' she wuz\ngone.\"\n\n\"Gone where?\"\n\n\"Dey don' nobody know whar, suh.\"\n\nLeaving Plato abruptly, Tryon hastened down the road toward Elder\nJohnson's cabin.  This was no time to stand on punctilio.  The girl had\nbeen lost in the woods in the storm, amid the thunder and lightning and\nthe pouring rain.  She was sick with fright and exposure, and he was\nthe cause of it all.  Bribery, corruption, and falsehood had brought\npunishment in their train, and the innocent had suffered while the\nguilty escaped. He must learn at once what had become of her. Reaching\nElder Johnson's house, he drew up by the front fence and gave the\ncustomary halloa, which summoned a woman to the door.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" he said, nodding unconsciously, with the careless\npoliteness of a gentleman to his inferiors.  \"I'm Mr. Tryon.  I have\ncome to inquire about the sick teacher.\"\n\n\"Why, suh,\" the woman replied respectfully, \"she got los' in de woods\nnight befo' las', an' she wuz out'n her min' most er de time yistiddy.\nLas' night she must 'a' got out er bed an' run away w'en eve'ybody wuz\nsoun' asleep, fer dis mawnin' she wuz gone, an' none er us knows whar\nshe is.\"\n\n\"Has any search been made for her?\"\n\n\"Yas, suh, my husban' an' de child'en has been huntin' roun' all de\nmawnin', an' he's gone ter borry a hoss now ter go fu'ther.  But Lawd\nknows dey ain' no tellin' whar she'd go, 'less'n she got her min' back\nsence she lef'.\"\n\nTryon's mare was in good condition.  He had money in his pocket and\nnothing to interfere with his movements.  He set out immediately on the\nroad to Patesville, keeping a lookout by the roadside, and stopping\neach person he met to inquire if a young woman, apparently ill, had\nbeen seen traveling along the road on foot.  No one had met such a\ntraveler.  When he had gone two or three miles, he drove through a\nshallow branch that crossed the road.  The splashing of his horse's\nhoofs in the water prevented him from hearing a low groan that came\nfrom the woods by the roadside.\n\nHe drove on, making inquiries at each farmhouse and of every person\nwhom he encountered. Shortly after crossing the branch, he met a young\nnegro with a cartload of tubs and buckets and piggins, and asked him if\nhe had seen on the road a young white woman with dark eyes and hair,\napparently sick or demented.  The young man answered in the negative,\nand Tryon pushed forward anxiously.\n\nAt noon he stopped at a farmhouse and swallowed a hasty meal.  His\ninquiries here elicited no information, and he was just leaving when a\nyoung man came in late to dinner and stated, in response to the usual\nquestion, that he had met, some two hours before, a young woman who\nanswered Tryon's description, on the Lillington road, which crossed the\nmain road to Patesville a short distance beyond the farmhouse.  He had\nspoken to the woman.  At first she had paid no heed to his question.\nWhen addressed a second time, she had answered in a rambling and\ndisconnected way, which indicated to his mind that there was something\nwrong with her.\n\nTryon thanked his informant and hastened to the Lillington road.\nStopping as before to inquire, he followed the woman for several hours,\neach mile of the distance taking him farther away from Patesville.\nFrom time to time he heard of the woman.  Toward nightfall he found\nher.  She was white enough, with the sallowness of the sandhill poor\nwhite.  She was still young, perhaps, but poverty and a hard life made\nher look older than she ought.  She was not fair, and she was not Rena.\nWhen Tryon came up to her, she was sitting on the doorsill of a\nmiserable cabin, and held in her hand a bottle, the contents of which\nhad never paid any revenue tax.  She had walked twenty miles that day,\nand had beguiled the tedium of the journey by occasional potations,\nwhich probably accounted for the incoherency of speech which several of\nthose who met her had observed.  When Tryon drew near, she tendered him\nthe bottle with tipsy cordiality.  He turned in disgust and retraced\nhis steps to the Patesville road, which he did not reach until\nnightfall.  As it was too dark to prosecute the search with any chance\nof success, he secured lodging for the night, intending to resume his\nquest early in the morning.\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nA MULE AND A CART\n\nFrank Fowler's heart was filled with longing for a sight of Rena's\nface.  When she had gone away first, on the ill-fated trip to South\nCarolina, her absence had left an aching void in his life; he had\nmissed her cheerful smile, her pleasant words, her graceful figure\nmoving about across the narrow street.  His work had grown monotonous\nduring her absence; the clatter of hammer and mallet, that had seemed\nso merry when punctuated now and then by the strains of her voice,\nbecame a mere humdrum rapping of wood upon wood and iron upon iron.  He\nhad sought work in South Carolina with the hope that he might see her.\nHe had satisfied this hope, and had tried in vain to do her a service;\nbut Fate had been against her; her castle of cards had come tumbling\ndown.  He felt that her sorrow had brought her nearer to him. The\ndistance between them depended very much upon their way of looking at\nthings.  He knew that her experience had dragged her through the valley\nof humiliation.  His unselfish devotion had reacted to refine and\nelevate his own spirit.  When he heard the suggestion, after her second\ndeparture, that she might marry Wain, he could not but compare himself\nwith this new aspirant.  He, Frank, was a man, an honest man--a better\nman than the shifty scoundrel with whom she had ridden away.  She was\nbut a woman, the best and sweetest and loveliest of all women, but yet\na woman. After a few short years of happiness or sorrow,--little of\njoy, perhaps, and much of sadness, which had begun already,--they would\nboth be food for worms.  White people, with a deeper wisdom perhaps\nthan they used in their own case, regarded Rena and himself as very\nmuch alike.  They were certainly both made by the same God, in much the\nsame physical and mental mould; they breathed the same air, ate the\nsame food, spoke the same speech, loved and hated, laughed and cried,\nlived and would die, the same.  If God had meant to rear any impassable\nbarrier between people of contrasting complexions, why did He not\nexpress the prohibition as He had done between other orders of creation?\n\nWhen Rena had departed for Sampson County, Frank had reconciled himself\nto her absence by the hope of her speedy return.  He often stepped\nacross the street to talk to Mis' Molly about her. Several letters had\npassed between mother and daughter, and in response to Frank's\ninquiries his neighbor uniformly stated that Rena was well and doing\nwell, and sent her love to all inquiring friends.  But Frank observed\nthat Mis' Molly, when pressed as to the date of Rena's return, grew\nmore and more indefinite; and finally the mother, in a burst of\nconfidential friendship, told Frank of all her hopes with reference to\nthe stranger from down the country.\n\n\"Yas, Frank,\" she concluded, \"it'll be her own fault ef she don't\nbecome a lady of proputty, fer Mr. Wain is rich, an' owns a big\nplantation, an' hires a lot of hands, and is a big man in the county.\nHe's crazy to git her, an' it all lays in her own han's.\"\n\nFrank did not find this news reassuring.  He believed that Wain was a\nliar and a scoundrel. He had nothing more than his intuitions upon\nwhich to found this belief, but it was none the less firm.  If his\nestimate of the man's character were correct, then his wealth might be\na fiction, pure and simple.  If so, the truth should be known to Mis'\nMolly, so that instead of encouraging a marriage with Wain, she would\nsee him in his true light, and interpose to rescue her daughter from\nhis importunities.  A day or two after this conversation, Frank met in\nthe town a negro from Sampson County, made his acquaintance, and\ninquired if he knew a man by the name of Jeff Wain.\n\n\"Oh, Jeff Wain!\" returned the countryman slightingly; \"yas, I knows\n'im, an' don' know no good of 'im.  One er dese yer biggity, braggin'\nniggers--talks lack he own de whole county, an' ain't wuth no mo' d'n I\nis--jes' a big bladder wid a handful er shot rattlin' roun' in it.  Had\na wife, when I wuz dere, an' beat her an' 'bused her so she had ter run\naway.\"\n\nThis was alarming information.  Wain had passed in the town as a single\nman, and Frank had had no hint that he had ever been married.  There\nwas something wrong somewhere.  Frank determined that he would find out\nthe truth and, if possible, do something to protect Rena against the\nobviously evil designs of the man who had taken her away.  The barrel\nfactory had so affected the cooper's trade that Peter and Frank had\nturned their attention more or less to the manufacture of small\nwoodenware for domestic use.  Frank's mule was eating off its own head,\nas the saying goes.  It required but little effort to persuade Peter\nthat his son might take a load of buckets and tubs and piggins into the\ncountry and sell them or trade them for country produce at a profit.\n\nIn a few days Frank had his stock prepared, and set out on the road to\nSampson County.  He went about thirty miles the first day, and camped\nby the roadside for the night, resuming the journey at dawn.  After\ndriving for an hour through the tall pines that overhung the road like\nthe stately arch of a cathedral aisle, weaving a carpet for the earth\nwith their brown spines and cones, and soothing the ear with their\nceaseless murmur, Frank stopped to water his mule at a point where the\nwhite, sandy road, widening as it went, sloped downward to a\nclear-running branch.  On the right a bay-tree bending over the stream\nmingled the heavy odor of its flowers with the delicate perfume of a\nyellow jessamine vine that had overrun a clump of saplings on the left.\nFrom a neighboring tree a silver-throated mocking-bird poured out a\nflood of riotous melody.  A group of minnows; startled by the splashing\nof the mule's feet, darted away into the shadow of the thicket, their\nquick passage leaving the amber water filled with laughing light.\n\nThe mule drank long and lazily, while over Frank stole thoughts in\nharmony with the peaceful scene,--thoughts of Rena, young and\nbeautiful, her friendly smile, her pensive dark eyes.  He would soon\nsee her now, and if she had any cause for fear or unhappiness, he would\nplace himself at her service--for a day, a week, a month, a year, a\nlifetime, if need be.\n\nHis reverie was broken by a slight noise from the thicket at his left.\n\"I wonder who dat is?\" he muttered.  \"It soun's mighty quare, ter say\nde leas'.\"\n\nHe listened intently for a moment, but heard nothing further.  \"It must\n'a' be'n a rabbit er somethin' scamp'in' th'ough de woods.  G'long\ndere, Caesar!\"\n\nAs the mule stepped forward, the sound was repeated.  This time it was\ndistinctly audible, the long, low moan of some one in sickness or\ndistress.\n\n\"Dat ain't no rabbit,\" said Frank to himself. \"Dere's somethin' wrong\ndere.  Stan' here, Caesar, till I look inter dis matter.\"\n\nPulling out from the branch, Frank sprang from the saddle and pushed\nhis way cautiously through the outer edge of the thicket.\n\n\"Good Lawd!\" he exclaimed with a start, \"it's a woman--a w'ite woman!\"\n\nThe slender form of a young woman lay stretched upon the ground in a\nsmall open space a few yards in extent.  Her face was turned away, and\nFrank could see at first only a tangled mass of dark brown hair, matted\nwith twigs and leaves and cockleburs, and hanging in wild profusion\naround her neck.\n\nFrank stood for a moment irresolute, debating the serious question\nwhether he should investigate further with a view to rendering\nassistance, or whether he should put as great a distance as possible\nbetween himself and this victim, as she might easily be, of some\nviolent crime, lest he should himself be suspected of it--a not\nunlikely contingency, if he were found in the neighborhood and the\nwoman should prove unable to describe her assailant.  While he\nhesitated, the figure moved restlessly, and a voice murmured:--\n\n\"Mamma, oh, mamma!\"\n\nThe voice thrilled Frank like an electric shock. Trembling in every\nlimb, he sprang forward toward the prostrate figure.  The woman turned\nher head, and he saw that it was Rena.  Her gown was torn and dusty,\nand fringed with burs and briars. When she had wandered forth, half\ndelirious, pursued by imaginary foes, she had not stopped to put on her\nshoes, and her little feet were blistered and swollen and bleeding.\nFrank knelt by her side and lifted her head on his arm.  He put his\nhand upon her brow; it was burning with fever.\n\n\"Miss Rena!  Rena! don't you know me?\"\n\nShe turned her wild eyes on him suddenly. \"Yes, I know you, Jeff Wain.\nGo away from me!  Go away!\"\n\nHer voice rose to a scream; she struggled in his grasp and struck at\nhim fiercely with her clenched fists.  Her sleeve fell back and\ndisclosed the white scar made by his own hand so many years before.\n\n\"You're a wicked man,\" she panted.  \"Don't touch me!  I hate you and\ndespise you!\"\n\nFrank could only surmise how she had come here, in such a condition.\nWhen she spoke of Wain in this manner, he drew his own conclusions.\nSome deadly villainy of Wain's had brought her to this pass.  Anger\nstirred his nature to the depths, and found vent in curses on the\nauthor of Rena's misfortunes.\n\n\"Damn him!\" he groaned.  \"I'll have his heart's blood fer dis, ter de\nlas' drop!\"\n\nRena now laughed and put up her arms appealingly.  \"George,\" she cried,\nin melting tones, \"dear George, do you love me?  How much do you love\nme?  Ah, you don't love me!\" she moaned; \"I'm black; you don't love me;\nyou despise me!\"\n\nHer voice died away into a hopeless wail. Frank knelt by her side, his\nfaithful heart breaking with pity, great tears rolling untouched down\nhis dusky cheeks.\n\n\"Oh, my honey, my darlin',\" he sobbed, \"Frank loves you better 'n all\nde worl'.\"\n\nMeantime the sun shone on as brightly as before, the mocking-bird sang\nyet more joyously. A gentle breeze sprang up and wafted the odor of bay\nand jessamine past them on its wings.  The grand triumphal sweep of\nnature's onward march recked nothing of life's little tragedies.\n\nWhen the first burst of his grief was over, Frank brought water from\nthe branch, bathed Rena's face and hands and feet, and forced a few\ndrops between her reluctant lips.  He then pitched the cartload of\ntubs, buckets, and piggins out into the road, and gathering dried\nleaves and pine-straw, spread them in the bottom of the cart.  He\nstooped, lifted her frail form in his arms, and laid it on the leafy\nbed.  Cutting a couple of hickory withes, he arched them over the cart,\nand gathering an armful of jessamine quickly wove it into an awning to\nprotect her from the sun.  She was quieter now, and seemed to fall\nasleep.\n\n\"Go ter sleep, honey,\" he murmured caressingly, \"go ter sleep, an'\nFrank'll take you home ter yo' mammy!\"\n\nToward noon he was met by a young white man, who peered inquisitively\ninto the canopied cart.\n\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed the stranger, \"who've you got there?\"\n\n\"A sick woman, suh.\"\n\n\"Why, she's white, as I'm a sinner!\" he cried, after a closer\ninspection.  \"Look a-here, nigger, what are you doin' with this white\nwoman?\"\n\n\"She's not w'ite, boss,--she's a bright mulatter.\"\n\n\"Yas, mighty bright,\" continued the stranger suspiciously.  \"Where are\nyou goin' with her?\"\n\n\"I'm takin' her ter Patesville, ter her mammy.\"\n\nThe stranger passed on.  Toward evening Frank heard hounds baying in\nthe distance.  A fox, weary with running, brush drooping, crossed the\nroad ahead of the cart.  Presently, the hounds straggled across the\nroad, followed by two or three hunters on horseback, who stopped at\nsight of the strangely canopied cart.  They stared at the sick girl and\ndemanded who she was.\n\n\"I don't b'lieve she's black at all,\" declared one, after Frank's brief\nexplanation.  \"This nigger has a bad eye,--he's up ter some sort of\ndevilment.  What ails the girl?\"\n\n\"'Pears ter be some kind of a fever,\" replied Frank; adding\ndiplomatically, \"I don't know whether it's ketchin' er no--she's be'n\nout er her head most er de time.\"\n\nThey drew off a little at this.  \"I reckon it's all right,\" said the\nchief spokesman.  The hounds were baying clamorously in the distance.\nThe hunters followed the sound and disappeared m the woods.\n\nFrank drove all day and all night, stopping only for brief periods of\nrest and refreshment.  At dawn, from the top of the long white hill, he\nsighted the river bridge below.  At sunrise he rapped at Mis' Molly's\ndoor.\n\n\nUpon rising at dawn, Tryon's first step, after a hasty breakfast, was\nto turn back toward Clinton. He had wasted half a day in following the\nfalse scent on the Lillington road.  It seemed, after reflection,\nunlikely that a woman seriously ill should have been able to walk any\nconsiderable distance before her strength gave out.  In her delirium,\ntoo, she might have wandered in a wrong direction, imagining any road\nto lead to Patesville. It would be a good plan to drive back home,\ncontinuing his inquiries meantime, and ascertain whether or not she had\nbeen found by those who were seeking her, including many whom Tryon's\ninquiries had placed upon the alert.  If she should prove still\nmissing, he would resume the journey to Patesville and continue the\nsearch in that direction.  She had probably not wandered far from the\nhighroad; even in delirium she would be likely to avoid the deep woods,\nwith which her illness was associated.\n\nHe had retraced more than half the distance to Clinton when he overtook\na covered wagon. The driver, when questioned, said that he had met a\nyoung negro with a mule, and a cart in which lay a young woman, white\nto all appearance, but claimed by the negro to be a colored girl who\nhad been taken sick on the road, and whom he was conveying home to her\nmother at Patesville. From a further description of the cart Tryon\nrecognized it as the one he had met the day before. The woman could be\nno other than Rena.  He turned his mare and set out swiftly on the road\nto Patesville.\n\nIf anything could have taken more complete possession of George Tryon\nat twenty-three than love successful and triumphant, it was love\nthwarted and denied.  Never in the few brief delirious weeks of his\ncourtship had he felt so strongly drawn to the beautiful sister of the\npopular lawyer, as he was now driven by an aching heart toward the same\nwoman stripped of every adventitions advantage and placed, by custom,\nbeyond the pale of marriage with men of his own race.  Custom was\ntyranny.  Love was the only law.  Would God have made hearts to so\nyearn for one another if He had meant them to stay forever apart?  If\nthis girl should die, it would be he who had killed her, by his\ncruelty, no less surely than if with his own hand he had struck her\ndown.  He had been so dazzled by his own superiority, so blinded by his\nown glory, that he had ruthlessly spurned and spoiled the image of God\nin this fair creature, whom he might have had for his own\ntreasure,--whom, please God, he would yet have, at any cost, to love\nand cherish while they both should live. There were difficulties--they\nhad seemed insuperable, but love would surmount them.  Sacrifices must\nbe made, but if the world without love would be nothing, then why not\ngive up the world for love?  He would hasten to Patesville.  He would\nfind her; he would tell her that he loved her, that she was all the\nworld to him, that he had come to marry her, and take her away where\nthey might be happy together.  He pictured to himself the joy that\nwould light up her face; he felt her soft arms around his neck, her\ntremulous kisses upon his lips.  If she were ill, his love would woo\nher back to health,--if disappointment and sorrow had contributed to\nher illness, joy and gladness should lead to her recovery.\n\nHe urged the mare forward; if she would but keep up her present pace,\nhe would reach Patesville by nightfall.\n\n\nDr. Green had just gone down the garden path to his buggy at the gate.\nMis' Molly came out to the back piazza, where Frank, weary and haggard,\nsat on the steps with Homer Pettifoot and Billy Oxendine, who, hearing\nof Rena's return, had come around after their day's work.\n\n\"Rena wants to see you, Frank,\" said Mis' Molly, with a sob.\n\nHe walked in softly, reverently, and stood by her bedside.  She turned\nher gentle eyes upon him and put out her slender hand, which he took in\nhis own broad palm.\n\n\"Frank,\" she murmured, \"my good friend--my best friend--you loved me\nbest of them all.\"\n\nThe tears rolled untouched down his cheeks. \"I'd 'a' died, fer you,\nMiss Rena,\" he said brokenly.\n\nMary B. threw open a window to make way for the passing spirit, and the\nred and golden glory of the setting sun, triumphantly ending his daily\ncourse, flooded the narrow room with light.\n\n\nBetween sunset and dark a traveler, seated in a dusty buggy drawn by a\ntired horse, crossed the long river bridge and drove up Front Street.\nJust as the buggy reached the gate in front of the house behind the\ncedars, a woman was tying a piece of crape upon the door-knob.  Pale\nwith apprehension, Tryon sat as if petrified, until a tall,\nside-whiskered mulatto came down the garden walk to the front gate.\n\n\"Who's dead?\" demanded Tryon hoarsely, scarcely recognizing his own\nvoice.\n\n\"A young cullud 'oman, sah,\" answered Homer Pettifoot, touching his\nhat, \"Mis' Molly Walden's daughter Rena.\""
