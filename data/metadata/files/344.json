A boat had put me ashore the night before at\nGrisapol; I had such breakfast as the little inn afforded, and, leaving\nall my baggage till I had an occasion to come round for it by sea, struck\nright across the promontory with a cheerful heart.\n\nI was far from being a native of these parts, springing, as I did, from\nan unmixed lowland stock.  But an uncle of mine, Gordon Darnaway, after a\npoor, rough youth, and some years at sea, had married a young wife in the\nislands; Mary Maclean she was called, the last of her family; and when\nshe died in giving birth to a daughter, Aros, the sea-girt farm, had\nremained in his possession.  It brought him in nothing but the means of\nlife, as I was well aware; but he was a man whom ill-fortune had pursued;\nhe feared, cumbered as he was with the young child, to make a fresh\nadventure upon life; and remained in Aros, biting his nails at destiny.\nYears passed over his head in that isolation, and brought neither help\nnor contentment.  Meantime our family was dying out in the lowlands;\nthere is little luck for any of that race; and perhaps my father was the\nluckiest of all, for not only was he one of the last to die, but he left\na son to his name and a little money to support it.  I was a student of\nEdinburgh University, living well enough at my own charges, but without\nkith or kin; when some news of me found its way to Uncle Gordon on the\nRoss of Grisapol; and he, as he was a man who held blood thicker than\nwater, wrote to me the day he heard of my existence, and taught me to\ncount Aros as my home.  Thus it was that I came to spend my vacations in\nthat part of the country, so far from all society and comfort, between\nthe codfish and the moorcocks; and thus it was that now, when I had done\nwith my classes, I was returning thither with so light a heart that July\nday.\n\nThe Ross, as we call it, is a promontory neither wide nor high, but as\nrough as God made it to this day; the deep sea on either hand of it, full\nof rugged isles and reefs most perilous to seamen--all overlooked from\nthe eastward by some very high cliffs and the great peals of Ben Kyaw.\n_The Mountain of the Mist_, they say the words signify in the Gaelic\ntongue; and it is well named.  For that hill-top, which is more than\nthree thousand feet in height, catches all the clouds that come blowing\nfrom the seaward; and, indeed, I used often to think that it must make\nthem for itself; since when all heaven was clear to the sea level, there\nwould ever be a streamer on Ben Kyaw.  It brought water, too, and was\nmossy {5} to the top in consequence.  I have seen us sitting in broad\nsunshine on the Ross, and the rain falling black like crape upon the\nmountain.  But the wetness of it made it often appear more beautiful to\nmy eyes; for when the sun struck upon the hill sides, there were many wet\nrocks and watercourses that shone like jewels even as far as Aros,\nfifteen miles away.\n\nThe road that I followed was a cattle-track.  It twisted so as nearly to\ndouble the length of my journey; it went over rough boulders so that a\nman had to leap from one to another, and through soft bottoms where the\nmoss came nearly to the knee.  There was no cultivation anywhere, and not\none house in the ten miles from Grisapol to Aros.  Houses of course there\nwere--three at least; but they lay so far on the one side or the other\nthat no stranger could have found them from the track.  A large part of\nthe Ross is covered with big granite rocks, some of them larger than a\ntwo-roomed house, one beside another, with fern and deep heather in\nbetween them where the vipers breed.  Anyway the wind was, it was always\nsea air, as salt as on a ship; the gulls were as free as moorfowl over\nall the Ross; and whenever the way rose a little, your eye would kindle\nwith the brightness of the sea.  From the very midst of the land, on a\nday of wind and a high spring, I have heard the Roost roaring, like a\nbattle where it runs by Aros, and the great and fearful voices of the\nbreakers that we call the Merry Men.\n\nAros itself--Aros Jay, I have heard the natives call it, and they say it\nmeans _the House of God_--Aros itself was not properly a piece of the\nRoss, nor was it quite an islet.  It formed the south-west corner of the\nland, fitted close to it, and was in one place only separated from the\ncoast by a little gut of the sea, not forty feet across the narrowest.\nWhen the tide was full, this was clear and still, like a pool on a land\nriver; only there was a difference in the weeds and fishes, and the water\nitself was green instead of brown; but when the tide went out, in the\nbottom of the ebb, there was a day or two in every month when you could\npass dryshod from Aros to the mainland.  There was some good pasture,\nwhere my uncle fed the sheep he lived on; perhaps the feed was better\nbecause the ground rose higher on the islet than the main level of the\nRoss, but this I am not skilled enough to settle.  The house was a good\none for that country, two storeys high.  It looked westward over a bay,\nwith a pier hard by for a boat, and from the door you could watch the\nvapours blowing on Ben Kyaw.\n\nOn all this part of the coast, and especially near Aros, these great\ngranite rocks that I have spoken of go down together in troops into the\nsea, like cattle on a summer's day.  There they stand, for all the world\nlike their neighbours ashore; only the salt water sobbing between them\ninstead of the quiet earth, and clots of sea-pink blooming on their sides\ninstead of heather; and the great sea conger to wreathe about the base of\nthem instead of the poisonous viper of the land.  On calm days you can go\nwandering between them in a boat for hours, echoes following you about\nthe labyrinth; but when the sea is up, Heaven help the man that hears\nthat cauldron boiling.\n\nOff the south-west end of Aros these blocks are very many, and much\ngreater in size.  Indeed, they must grow monstrously bigger out to sea,\nfor there must be ten sea miles of open water sown with them as thick as\na country place with houses, some standing thirty feet above the tides,\nsome covered, but all perilous to ships; so that on a clear, westerly\nblowing day, I have counted, from the top of Aros, the great rollers\nbreaking white and heavy over as many as six-and-forty buried reefs.  But\nit is nearer in shore that the danger is worst; for the tide, here\nrunning like a mill race, makes a long belt of broken water--a _Roost_ we\ncall it--at the tail of the land.  I have often been out there in a dead\ncalm at the slack of the tide; and a strange place it is, with the sea\nswirling and combing up and boiling like the cauldrons of a linn, and now\nand again a little dancing mutter of sound as though the _Roost_ were\ntalking to itself.  But when the tide begins to run again, and above all\nin heavy weather, there is no man could take a boat within half a mile of\nit, nor a ship afloat that could either steer or live in such a place.\nYou can hear the roaring of it six miles away.  At the seaward end there\ncomes the strongest of the bubble; and it's here that these big breakers\ndance together--the dance of death, it may be called--that have got the\nname, in these parts, of the Merry Men.  I have heard it said that they\nrun fifty feet high; but that must be the green water only, for the spray\nruns twice as high as that.  Whether they got the name from their\nmovements, which are swift and antic, or from the shouting they make\nabout the turn of the tide, so that all Aros shakes with it, is more than\nI can tell.\n\nThe truth is, that in a south-westerly wind, that part of our archipelago\nis no better than a trap.  If a ship got through the reefs, and weathered\nthe Merry Men, it would be to come ashore on the south coast of Aros, in\nSandag Bay, where so many dismal things befell our family, as I propose\nto tell.  The thought of all these dangers, in the place I knew so long,\nmakes me particularly welcome the works now going forward to set lights\nupon the headlands and buoys along the channels of our iron-bound,\ninhospitable islands.\n\nThe country people had many a story about Aros, as I used to hear from my\nuncle's man, Rorie, an old servant of the Macleans, who had transferred\nhis services without afterthought on the occasion of the marriage.  There\nwas some tale of an unlucky creature, a sea-kelpie, that dwelt and did\nbusiness in some fearful manner of his own among the boiling breakers of\nthe Roost.  A mermaid had once met a piper on Sandag beach, and there\nsang to him a long, bright midsummer's night, so that in the morning he\nwas found stricken crazy, and from thenceforward, till the day he died,\nsaid only one form of words; what they were in the original Gaelic I\ncannot tell, but they were thus translated: 'Ah, the sweet singing out of\nthe sea.'  Seals that haunted on that coast have been known to speak to\nman in his own tongue, presaging great disasters.  It was here that a\ncertain saint first landed on his voyage out of Ireland to convert the\nHebrideans.  And, indeed, I think he had some claim to be called saint;\nfor, with the boats of that past age, to make so rough a passage, and\nland on such a ticklish coast, was surely not far short of the\nmiraculous.  It was to him, or to some of his monkish underlings who had\na cell there, that the islet owes its holy and beautiful name, the House\nof God.\n\nAmong these old wives' stories there was one which I was inclined to hear\nwith more credulity.  As I was told, in that tempest which scattered the\nships of the Invincible Armada over all the north and west of Scotland,\none great vessel came ashore on Aros, and before the eyes of some\nsolitary people on a hill-top, went down in a moment with all hands, her\ncolours flying even as she sank.  There was some likelihood in this tale;\nfor another of that fleet lay sunk on the north side, twenty miles from\nGrisapol.  It was told, I thought, with more detail and gravity than its\ncompanion stories, and there was one particularity which went far to\nconvince me of its truth: the name, that is, of the ship was still\nremembered, and sounded, in my ears, Spanishly.  The _Espirito Santo_\nthey called it, a great ship of many decks of guns, laden with treasure\nand grandees of Spain, and fierce soldadoes, that now lay fathom deep to\nall eternity, done with her wars and voyages, in Sandag bay, upon the\nwest of Aros.  No more salvos of ordnance for that tall ship, the 'Holy\nSpirit,' no more fair winds or happy ventures; only to rot there deep in\nthe sea-tangle and hear the shoutings of the Merry Men as the tide ran\nhigh about the island.  It was a strange thought to me first and last,\nand only grew stranger as I learned the more of Spain, from which she had\nset sail with so proud a company, and King Philip, the wealthy king, that\nsent her on that voyage.\n\nAnd now I must tell you, as I walked from Grisapol that day, the\n_Espirito Santo_ was very much in my reflections.  I had been favourably\nremarked by our then Principal in Edinburgh College, that famous writer,\nDr. Robertson, and by him had been set to work on some papers of an\nancient date to rearrange and sift of what was worthless; and in one of\nthese, to my great wonder, I found a note of this very ship, the\n_Espirito Santo_, with her captain's name, and how she carried a great\npart of the Spaniard's treasure, and had been lost upon the Ross of\nGrisapol; but in what particular spot, the wild tribes of that place and\nperiod would give no information to the king's inquiries.  Putting one\nthing with another, and taking our island tradition together with this\nnote of old King Jamie's perquisitions after wealth, it had come strongly\non my mind that the spot for which he sought in vain could be no other\nthan the small bay of Sandag on my uncle's land; and being a fellow of a\nmechanical turn, I had ever since been plotting how to weigh that good\nship up again with all her ingots, ounces, and doubloons, and bring back\nour house of Darnaway to its long-forgotten dignity and wealth.\n\nThis was a design of which I soon had reason to repent.  My mind was\nsharply turned on different reflections; and since I became the witness\nof a strange judgment of God's, the thought of dead men's treasures has\nbeen intolerable to my conscience.  But even at that time I must acquit\nmyself of sordid greed; for if I desired riches, it was not for their own\nsake, but for the sake of a person who was dear to my heart--my uncle's\ndaughter, Mary Ellen.  She had been educated well, and had been a time to\nschool upon the mainland; which, poor girl, she would have been happier\nwithout.  For Aros was no place for her, with old Rorie the servant, and\nher father, who was one of the unhappiest men in Scotland, plainly bred\nup in a country place among Cameronians, long a skipper sailing out of\nthe Clyde about the islands, and now, with infinite discontent, managing\nhis sheep and a little 'long shore fishing for the necessary bread.  If\nit was sometimes weariful to me, who was there but a month or two, you\nmay fancy what it was to her who dwelt in that same desert all the year\nround, with the sheep and flying sea-gulls, and the Merry Men singing and\ndancing in the Roost!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  WHAT THE WRECK HAD BROUGHT TO AROS.\n\n\nIt was half-flood when I got the length of Aros; and there was nothing\nfor it but to stand on the far shore and whistle for Rorie with the boat.\nI had no need to repeat the signal.  At the first sound, Mary was at the\ndoor flying a handkerchief by way of answer, and the old long-legged\nserving-man was shambling down the gravel to the pier.  For all his\nhurry, it took him a long while to pull across the bay; and I observed\nhim several times to pause, go into the stern, and look over curiously\ninto the wake.  As he came nearer, he seemed to me aged and haggard, and\nI thought he avoided my eye.  The coble had been repaired, with two new\nthwarts and several patches of some rare and beautiful foreign wood, the\nname of it unknown to me.\n\n'Why, Rorie,' said I, as we began the return voyage, 'this is fine wood.\nHow came you by that?'\n\n'It will be hard to cheesel,' Rorie opined reluctantly; and just then,\ndropping the oars, he made another of those dives into the stern which I\nhad remarked as he came across to fetch me, and, leaning his hand on my\nshoulder, stared with an awful look into the waters of the bay.\n\n'What is wrong?' I asked, a good deal startled.\n\n'It will be a great feesh,' said the old man, returning to his oars; and\nnothing more could I get out of him, but strange glances and an ominous\nnodding of the head.  In spite of myself, I was infected with a measure\nof uneasiness; I turned also, and studied the wake.  The water was still\nand transparent, but, out here in the middle of the bay, exceeding deep.\nFor some time I could see naught; but at last it did seem to me as if\nsomething dark--a great fish, or perhaps only a shadow--followed\nstudiously in the track of the moving coble.  And then I remembered one\nof Rorie's superstitions: how in a ferry in Morven, in some great,\nexterminating feud among the clans; a fish, the like of it unknown in all\nour waters, followed for some years the passage of the ferry-boat, until\nno man dared to make the crossing.\n\n'He will be waiting for the right man,' said Rorie.\n\nMary met me on the beach, and led me up the brae and into the house of\nAros.  Outside and inside there were many changes.  The garden was fenced\nwith the same wood that I had noted in the boat; there were chairs in the\nkitchen covered with strange brocade; curtains of brocade hung from the\nwindow; a clock stood silent on the dresser; a lamp of brass was swinging\nfrom the roof; the table was set for dinner with the finest of linen and\nsilver; and all these new riches were displayed in the plain old kitchen\nthat I knew so well, with the high-backed settle, and the stools, and the\ncloset bed for Rorie; with the wide chimney the sun shone into, and the\nclear-smouldering peats; with the pipes on the mantelshelf and the three-\ncornered spittoons, filled with sea-shells instead of sand, on the floor;\nwith the bare stone walls and the bare wooden floor, and the three\npatchwork rugs that were of yore its sole adornment--poor man's\npatchwork, the like of it unknown in cities, woven with homespun, and\nSunday black, and sea-cloth polished on the bench of rowing.  The room,\nlike the house, had been a sort of wonder in that country-side, it was so\nneat and habitable; and to see it now, shamed by these incongruous\nadditions, filled me with indignation and a kind of anger.  In view of\nthe errand I had come upon to Aros, the feeling was baseless and unjust;\nbut it burned high, at the first moment, in my heart.\n\n'Mary, girl,' said I, 'this is the place I had learned to call my home,\nand I do not know it.'\n\n'It is my home by nature, not by the learning,' she replied; 'the place I\nwas born and the place I'm like to die in; and I neither like these\nchanges, nor the way they came, nor that which came with them.  I would\nhave liked better, under God's pleasure, they had gone down into the sea,\nand the Merry Men were dancing on them now.'\n\nMary was always serious; it was perhaps the only trait that she shared\nwith her father; but the tone with which she uttered these words was even\ngraver than of custom.\n\n'Ay,' said I, 'I feared it came by wreck, and that's by death; yet when\nmy father died, I took his goods without remorse.'\n\n'Your father died a clean strae death, as the folk say,' said Mary.\n\n'True,' I returned; 'and a wreck is like a judgment.  What was she\ncalled?'\n\n'They ca'd her the _Christ-Anna_,' said a voice behind me; and, turning\nround, I saw my uncle standing in the doorway.\n\nHe was a sour, small, bilious man, with a long face and very dark eyes;\nfifty-six years old, sound and active in body, and with an air somewhat\nbetween that of a shepherd and that of a man following the sea.  He never\nlaughed, that I heard; read long at the Bible; prayed much, like the\nCameronians he had been brought up among; and indeed, in many ways, used\nto remind me of one of the hill-preachers in the killing times before the\nRevolution.  But he never got much comfort, nor even, as I used to think,\nmuch guidance, by his piety.  He had his black fits when he was afraid of\nhell; but he had led a rough life, to which he would look back with envy,\nand was still a rough, cold, gloomy man.\n\nAs he came in at the door out of the sunlight, with his bonnet on his\nhead and a pipe hanging in his button-hole, he seemed, like Rorie, to\nhave grown older and paler, the lines were deeplier ploughed upon his\nface, and the whites of his eyes were yellow, like old stained ivory, or\nthe bones of the dead.\n\n'Ay' he repeated, dwelling upon the first part of the word, 'the _Christ-\nAnna_.  It's an awfu' name.'\n\nI made him my salutations, and complimented him upon his look of health;\nfor I feared he had perhaps been ill.\n\n'I'm in the body,' he replied, ungraciously enough; 'aye in the body and\nthe sins of the body, like yoursel'.  Denner,' he said abruptly to Mary,\nand then ran on to me: 'They're grand braws, thir that we hae gotten, are\nthey no?  Yon's a bonny knock {15}, but it'll no gang; and the napery's\nby ordnar.  Bonny, bairnly braws; it's for the like o' them folk sells\nthe peace of God that passeth understanding; it's for the like o' them,\nan' maybe no even sae muckle worth, folk daunton God to His face and burn\nin muckle hell; and it's for that reason the Scripture ca's them, as I\nread the passage, the accursed thing.  Mary, ye girzie,' he interrupted\nhimself to cry with some asperity, 'what for hae ye no put out the twa\ncandlesticks?'\n\n'Why should we need them at high noon?' she asked.\n\nBut my uncle was not to be turned from his idea.  'We'll bruik {16} them\nwhile we may,' he said; and so two massive candlesticks of wrought silver\nwere added to the table equipage, already so unsuited to that rough sea-\nside farm.\n\n'She cam' ashore Februar' 10, about ten at nicht,' he went on to me.\n'There was nae wind, and a sair run o' sea; and she was in the sook o'\nthe Roost, as I jaloose.  We had seen her a' day, Rorie and me, beating\nto the wind.  She wasnae a handy craft, I'm thinking, that _Christ-Anna_;\nfor she would neither steer nor stey wi' them.  A sair day they had of\nit; their hands was never aff the sheets, and it perishin' cauld--ower\ncauld to snaw; and aye they would get a bit nip o' wind, and awa' again,\nto pit the emp'y hope into them.  Eh, man! but they had a sair day for\nthe last o't!  He would have had a prood, prood heart that won ashore\nupon the back o' that.'\n\n'And were all lost?' I cried.  'God held them!'\n\n'Wheesht!' he said sternly.  'Nane shall pray for the deid on my hearth-\nstane.'\n\nI disclaimed a Popish sense for my ejaculation; and he seemed to accept\nmy disclaimer with unusual facility, and ran on once more upon what had\nevidently become a favourite subject.\n\n'We fand her in Sandag Bay, Rorie an' me, and a' thae braws in the inside\nof her.  There's a kittle bit, ye see, about Sandag; whiles the sook rins\nstrong for the Merry Men; an' whiles again, when the tide's makin' hard\nan' ye can hear the Roost blawin' at the far-end of Aros, there comes a\nback-spang of current straucht into Sandag Bay.  Weel, there's the thing\nthat got the grip on the _Christ-Anna_.  She but to have come in ram-stam\nan' stern forrit; for the bows of her are aften under, and the back-side\nof her is clear at hie-water o' neaps.  But, man! the dunt that she cam\ndoon wi' when she struck!  Lord save us a'! but it's an unco life to be a\nsailor--a cauld, wanchancy life.  Mony's the gliff I got mysel' in the\ngreat deep; and why the Lord should hae made yon unco water is mair than\never I could win to understand.  He made the vales and the pastures, the\nbonny green yaird, the halesome, canty land--\n\n   And now they shout and sing to Thee,\n   For Thou hast made them glad,\n\nas the Psalms say in the metrical version.  No that I would preen my\nfaith to that clink neither; but it's bonny, and easier to mind.  \"Who go\nto sea in ships,\" they hae't again--\n\n            And in\n      Great waters trading be,\n   Within the deep these men God's works\n      And His great wonders see.\n\nWeel, it's easy sayin' sae.  Maybe Dauvit wasnae very weel acquant wi'\nthe sea.  But, troth, if it wasnae prentit in the Bible, I wad whiles be\ntemp'it to think it wasnae the Lord, but the muckle, black deil that made\nthe sea.  There's naething good comes oot o't but the fish; an' the\nspentacle o' God riding on the tempest, to be shure, whilk would be what\nDauvit was likely ettling at.  But, man, they were sair wonders that God\nshowed to the _Christ-Anna_--wonders, do I ca' them?  Judgments, rather:\njudgments in the mirk nicht among the draygons o' the deep.  And their\nsouls--to think o' that--their souls, man, maybe no prepared!  The sea--a\nmuckle yett to hell!'\n\nI observed, as my uncle spoke, that his voice was unnaturally moved and\nhis manner unwontedly demonstrative.  He leaned forward at these last\nwords, for example, and touched me on the knee with his spread fingers,\nlooking up into my face with a certain pallor, and I could see that his\neyes shone with a deep-seated fire, and that the lines about his mouth\nwere drawn and tremulous.\n\nEven the entrance of Rorie, and the beginning of our meal, did not detach\nhim from his train of thought beyond a moment.  He condescended, indeed,\nto ask me some questions as to my success at college, but I thought it\nwas with half his mind; and even in his extempore grace, which was, as\nusual, long and wandering, I could find the trace of his preoccupation,\npraying, as he did, that God would 'remember in mercy fower puir,\nfeckless, fiddling, sinful creatures here by their lee-lane beside the\ngreat and dowie waters.'\n\nSoon there came an interchange of speeches between him and Rorie.\n\n'Was it there?' asked my uncle.\n\n'Ou, ay!' said Rorie.\n\nI observed that they both spoke in a manner of aside, and with some show\nof embarrassment, and that Mary herself appeared to colour, and looked\ndown on her plate.  Partly to show my knowledge, and so relieve the party\nfrom an awkward strain, partly because I was curious, I pursued the\nsubject.\n\n'You mean the fish?' I asked.\n\n'Whatten fish?' cried my uncle.  'Fish, quo' he!  Fish!  Your een are fu'\no' fatness, man; your heid dozened wi' carnal leir.  Fish! it's a bogle!'\n\nHe spoke with great vehemence, as though angry; and perhaps I was not\nvery willing to be put down so shortly, for young men are disputatious.\nAt least I remember I retorted hotly, crying out upon childish\nsuperstitions.\n\n'And ye come frae the College!' sneered Uncle Gordon.  'Gude kens what\nthey learn folk there; it's no muckle service onyway.  Do ye think, man,\nthat there's naething in a' yon saut wilderness o' a world oot wast\nthere, wi' the sea grasses growin', an' the sea beasts fechtin', an' the\nsun glintin' down into it, day by day?  Na; the sea's like the land, but\nfearsomer.  If there's folk ashore, there's folk in the sea--deid they\nmay be, but they're folk whatever; and as for deils, there's nane that's\nlike the sea deils.  There's no sae muckle harm in the land deils, when\na's said and done.  Lang syne, when I was a callant in the south country,\nI mind there was an auld, bald bogle in the Peewie Moss.  I got a glisk\no' him mysel', sittin' on his hunkers in a hag, as gray's a tombstane.\nAn', troth, he was a fearsome-like taed.  But he steered naebody.  Nae\ndoobt, if ane that was a reprobate, ane the Lord hated, had gane by there\nwi' his sin still upon his stamach, nae doobt the creature would hae\nlowped upo' the likes o' him.  But there's deils in the deep sea would\nyoke on a communicant!  Eh, sirs, if ye had gane doon wi' the puir lads\nin the _Christ-Anna_, ye would ken by now the mercy o' the seas.  If ye\nhad sailed it for as lang as me, ye would hate the thocht of it as I do.\nIf ye had but used the een God gave ye, ye would hae learned the\nwickedness o' that fause, saut, cauld, bullering creature, and of a'\nthat's in it by the Lord's permission: labsters an' partans, an' sic\nlike, howking in the deid; muckle, gutsy, blawing whales; an' fish--the\nhale clan o' them--cauld-wamed, blind-eed uncanny ferlies.  O, sirs,' he\ncried, 'the horror--the horror o' the sea!'\n\nWe were all somewhat staggered by this outburst; and the speaker himself,\nafter that last hoarse apostrophe, appeared to sink gloomily into his own\nthoughts.  But Rorie, who was greedy of superstitious lore, recalled him\nto the subject by a question.\n\n'You will not ever have seen a teevil of the sea?' he asked.\n\n'No clearly,' replied the other.  'I misdoobt if a mere man could see ane\nclearly and conteenue in the body.  I hae sailed wi' a lad--they ca'd him\nSandy Gabart; he saw ane, shure eneueh, an' shure eneueh it was the end\nof him.  We were seeven days oot frae the Clyde--a sair wark we had\nhad--gaun north wi' seeds an' braws an' things for the Macleod.  We had\ngot in ower near under the Cutchull'ns, an' had just gane about by soa,\nan' were off on a lang tack, we thocht would maybe hauld as far's\nCopnahow.  I mind the nicht weel; a mune smoored wi' mist; a fine gaun\nbreeze upon the water, but no steedy; an'--what nane o' us likit to\nhear--anither wund gurlin' owerheid, amang thae fearsome, auld stane\ncraigs o' the Cutchull'ns.  Weel, Sandy was forrit wi' the jib sheet; we\ncouldnae see him for the mains'l, that had just begude to draw, when a'\nat ance he gied a skirl.  I luffed for my life, for I thocht we were ower\nnear Soa; but na, it wasnae that, it was puir Sandy Gabart's deid\nskreigh, or near hand, for he was deid in half an hour.  A't he could\ntell was that a sea deil, or sea bogle, or sea spenster, or sic-like, had\nclum up by the bowsprit, an' gi'en him ae cauld, uncanny look.  An', or\nthe life was oot o' Sandy's body, we kent weel what the thing betokened,\nand why the wund gurled in the taps o' the Cutchull'ns; for doon it\ncam'--a wund do I ca' it! it was the wund o' the Lord's anger--an' a'\nthat nicht we foucht like men dementit, and the niest that we kenned we\nwere ashore in Loch Uskevagh, an' the cocks were crawin' in Benbecula.'\n\n'It will have been a merman,' Rorie said.\n\n'A merman!' screamed my uncle with immeasurable scorn.  'Auld wives'\nclavers!  There's nae sic things as mermen.'\n\n'But what was the creature like?' I asked.\n\n'What like was it?  Gude forbid that we suld ken what like it was!  It\nhad a kind of a heid upon it--man could say nae mair.'\n\nThen Rorie, smarting under the affront, told several tales of mermen,\nmermaids, and sea-horses that had come ashore upon the islands and\nattacked the crews of boats upon the sea; and my uncle, in spite of his\nincredulity, listened with uneasy interest.\n\n'Aweel, aweel,' he said, 'it may be sae; I may be wrang; but I find nae\nword o' mermen in the Scriptures.'\n\n'And you will find nae word of Aros Roost, maybe,' objected Rorie, and\nhis argument appeared to carry weight.\n\nWhen dinner was over, my uncle carried me forth with him to a bank behind\nthe house.  It was a very hot and quiet afternoon; scarce a ripple\nanywhere upon the sea, nor any voice but the familiar voice of sheep and\ngulls; and perhaps in consequence of this repose in nature, my kinsman\nshowed himself more rational and tranquil than before.  He spoke evenly\nand almost cheerfully of my career, with every now and then a reference\nto the lost ship or the treasures it had brought to Aros.  For my part, I\nlistened to him in a sort of trance, gazing with all my heart on that\nremembered scene, and drinking gladly the sea-air and the smoke of peats\nthat had been lit by Mary.\n\nPerhaps an hour had passed when my uncle, who had all the while been\ncovertly gazing on the surface of the little bay, rose to his feet and\nbade me follow his example.  Now I should say that the great run of tide\nat the south-west end of Aros exercises a perturbing influence round all\nthe coast.  In Sandag Bay, to the south, a strong current runs at certain\nperiods of the flood and ebb respectively; but in this northern bay--Aros\nBay, as it is called--where the house stands and on which my uncle was\nnow gazing, the only sign of disturbance is towards the end of the ebb,\nand even then it is too slight to be remarkable.  When there is any\nswell, nothing can be seen at all; but when it is calm, as it often is,\nthere appear certain strange, undecipherable marks--sea-runes, as we may\nname them--on the glassy surface of the bay.  The like is common in a\nthousand places on the coast; and many a boy must have amused himself as\nI did, seeking to read in them some reference to himself or those he\nloved.  It was to these marks that my uncle now directed my attention,\nstruggling, as he did so, with an evident reluctance.\n\n'Do ye see yon scart upo' the water?' he inquired; 'yon ane wast the gray\nstane?  Ay?  Weel, it'll no be like a letter, wull it?'\n\n'Certainly it is,' I replied.  'I have often remarked it.  It is like a\nC.'\n\nHe heaved a sigh as if heavily disappointed with my answer, and then\nadded below his breath: 'Ay, for the _Christ-Anna_.'\n\n'I used to suppose, sir, it was for myself,' said I; 'for my name is\nCharles.'\n\n'And so ye saw't afore?', he ran on, not heeding my remark.  'Weel, weel,\nbut that's unco strange.  Maybe, it's been there waitin', as a man wad\nsay, through a' the weary ages.  Man, but that's awfu'.'  And then,\nbreaking off: 'Ye'll no see anither, will ye?' he asked.\n\n'Yes,' said I.  'I see another very plainly, near the Ross side, where\nthe road comes down--an M.'\n\n'An M,' he repeated very low; and then, again after another pause: 'An'\nwhat wad ye make o' that?' he inquired.\n\n'I had always thought it to mean Mary, sir,' I answered, growing somewhat\nred, convinced as I was in my own mind that I was on the threshold of a\ndecisive explanation.\n\nBut we were each following his own train of thought to the exclusion of\nthe other's.  My uncle once more paid no attention to my words; only hung\nhis head and held his peace; and I might have been led to fancy that he\nhad not heard me, if his next speech had not contained a kind of echo\nfrom my own.\n\n'I would say naething o' thae clavers to Mary,' he observed, and began to\nwalk forward.\n\nThere is a belt of turf along the side of Aros Bay, where walking is\neasy; and it was along this that I silently followed my silent kinsman.  I\nwas perhaps a little disappointed at having lost so good an opportunity\nto declare my love; but I was at the same time far more deeply exercised\nat the change that had befallen my uncle.  He was never an ordinary,\nnever, in the strict sense, an amiable, man; but there was nothing in\neven the worst that I had known of him before, to prepare me for so\nstrange a transformation.  It was impossible to close the eyes against\none fact; that he had, as the saying goes, something on his mind; and as\nI mentally ran over the different words which might be represented by the\nletter M--misery, mercy, marriage, money, and the like--I was arrested\nwith a sort of start by the word murder.  I was still considering the\nugly sound and fatal meaning of the word, when the direction of our walk\nbrought us to a point from which a view was to be had to either side,\nback towards Aros Bay and homestead, and forward on the ocean, dotted to\nthe north with isles, and lying to the southward blue and open to the\nsky.  There my guide came to a halt, and stood staring for awhile on that\nexpanse.  Then he turned to me and laid a hand on my arm.\n\n'Ye think there's naething there?' he said, pointing with his pipe; and\nthen cried out aloud, with a kind of exultation: 'I'll tell ye, man!  The\ndeid are down there--thick like rattons!'\n\nHe turned at once, and, without another word, we retraced our steps to\nthe house of Aros.\n\nI was eager to be alone with Mary; yet it was not till after supper, and\nthen but for a short while, that I could have a word with her.  I lost no\ntime beating about the bush, but spoke out plainly what was on my mind.\n\n'Mary,' I said, 'I have not come to Aros without a hope.  If that should\nprove well founded, we may all leave and go somewhere else, secure of\ndaily bread and comfort; secure, perhaps, of something far beyond that,\nwhich it would seem extravagant in me to promise.  But there's a hope\nthat lies nearer to my heart than money.'  And at that I paused.  'You\ncan guess fine what that is, Mary,' I said.  She looked away from me in\nsilence, and that was small encouragement, but I was not to be put off.\n'All my days I have thought the world of you,' I continued; 'the time\ngoes on and I think always the more of you; I could not think to be happy\nor hearty in my life without you: you are the apple of my eye.'  Still\nshe looked away, and said never a word; but I thought I saw that her\nhands shook.  'Mary,' I cried in fear, 'do ye no like me?'\n\n'O, Charlie man,' she said, 'is this a time to speak of it?  Let me be, a\nwhile; let me be the way I am; it'll not be you that loses by the\nwaiting!'\n\nI made out by her voice that she was nearly weeping, and this put me out\nof any thought but to compose her.  'Mary Ellen,' I said, 'say no more; I\ndid not come to trouble you: your way shall be mine, and your time too;\nand you have told me all I wanted.  Only just this one thing more: what\nails you?'\n\nShe owned it was her father, but would enter into no particulars, only\nshook her head, and said he was not well and not like himself, and it was\na great pity.  She knew nothing of the wreck.  'I havenae been near it,'\nsaid she.  'What for would I go near it, Charlie lad?  The poor souls are\ngone to their account long syne; and I would just have wished they had\nta'en their gear with them--poor souls!'\n\nThis was scarcely any great encouragement for me to tell her of the\n_Espirito Santo_; yet I did so, and at the very first word she cried out\nin surprise.  'There was a man at Grisapol,' she said, 'in the month of\nMay--a little, yellow, black-avised body, they tell me, with gold rings\nupon his fingers, and a beard; and he was speiring high and low for that\nsame ship.'\n\nIt was towards the end of April that I had been given these papers to\nsort out by Dr. Robertson: and it came suddenly back upon my mind that\nthey were thus prepared for a Spanish historian, or a man calling himself\nsuch, who had come with high recommendations to the Principal, on a\nmission of inquiry as to the dispersion of the great Armada.  Putting one\nthing with another, I fancied that the visitor 'with the gold rings upon\nhis fingers' might be the same with Dr. Robertson's historian from\nMadrid.  If that were so, he would be more likely after treasure for\nhimself than information for a learned society.  I made up my mind, I\nshould lose no time over my undertaking; and if the ship lay sunk in\nSandag Bay, as perhaps both he and I supposed, it should not be for the\nadvantage of this ringed adventurer, but for Mary and myself, and for the\ngood, old, honest, kindly family of the Darnaways.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  LAND AND SEA IN SANDAG BAY.\n\n\nI was early afoot next morning; and as soon as I had a bite to eat, set\nforth upon a tour of exploration.  Something in my heart distinctly told\nme that I should find the ship of the Armada; and although I did not give\nway entirely to such hopeful thoughts, I was still very light in spirits\nand walked upon air.  Aros is a very rough islet, its surface strewn with\ngreat rocks and shaggy with fernland heather; and my way lay almost north\nand south across the highest knoll; and though the whole distance was\ninside of two miles it took more time and exertion than four upon a level\nroad.  Upon the summit, I paused.  Although not very high--not three\nhundred feet, as I think--it yet outtops all the neighbouring lowlands of\nthe Ross, and commands a great view of sea and islands.  The sun, which\nhad been up some time, was already hot upon my neck; the air was listless\nand thundery, although purely clear; away over the north-west, where the\nisles lie thickliest congregated, some half-a-dozen small and ragged\nclouds hung together in a covey; and the head of Ben Kyaw wore, not\nmerely a few streamers, but a solid hood of vapour.  There was a threat\nin the weather.  The sea, it is true, was smooth like glass: even the\nRoost was but a seam on that wide mirror, and the Merry Men no more than\ncaps of foam; but to my eye and ear, so long familiar with these places,\nthe sea also seemed to lie uneasily; a sound of it, like a long sigh,\nmounted to me where I stood; and, quiet as it was, the Roost itself\nappeared to be revolving mischief.  For I ought to say that all we\ndwellers in these parts attributed, if not prescience, at least a quality\nof warning, to that strange and dangerous creature of the tides.\n\nI hurried on, then, with the greater speed, and had soon descended the\nslope of Aros to the part that we call Sandag Bay.  It is a pretty large\npiece of water compared with the size of the isle; well sheltered from\nall but the prevailing wind; sandy and shoal and bounded by low\nsand-hills to the west, but to the eastward lying several fathoms deep\nalong a ledge of rocks.  It is upon that side that, at a certain time\neach flood, the current mentioned by my uncle sets so strong into the\nbay; a little later, when the Roost begins to work higher, an undertow\nruns still more strongly in the reverse direction; and it is the action\nof this last, as I suppose, that has scoured that part so deep.  Nothing\nis to be seen out of Sandag Bay, but one small segment of the horizon\nand, in heavy weather, the breakers flying high over a deep sea reef.\n\nFrom half-way down the hill, I had perceived the wreck of February last,\na brig of considerable tonnage, lying, with her back broken, high and dry\non the east corner of the sands; and I was making directly towards it,\nand already almost on the margin of the turf, when my eyes were suddenly\narrested by a spot, cleared of fern and heather, and marked by one of\nthose long, low, and almost human-looking mounds that we see so commonly\nin graveyards.  I stopped like a man shot.  Nothing had been said to me\nof any dead man or interment on the island; Rorie, Mary, and my uncle had\nall equally held their peace; of her at least, I was certain that she\nmust be ignorant; and yet here, before my eyes, was proof indubitable of\nthe fact.  Here was a grave; and I had to ask myself, with a chill, what\nmanner of man lay there in his last sleep, awaiting the signal of the\nLord in that solitary, sea-beat resting-place?  My mind supplied no\nanswer but what I feared to entertain.  Shipwrecked, at least, he must\nhave been; perhaps, like the old Armada mariners, from some far and rich\nland over-sea; or perhaps one of my own race, perishing within eyesight\nof the smoke of home.  I stood awhile uncovered by his side, and I could\nhave desired that it had lain in our religion to put up some prayer for\nthat unhappy stranger, or, in the old classic way, outwardly to honour\nhis misfortune.  I knew, although his bones lay there, a part of Aros,\ntill the trumpet sounded, his imperishable soul was forth and far away,\namong the raptures of the everlasting Sabbath or the pangs of hell; and\nyet my mind misgave me even with a fear, that perhaps he was near me\nwhere I stood, guarding his sepulchre, and lingering on the scene of his\nunhappy fate.\n\nCertainly it was with a spirit somewhat over-shadowed that I turned away\nfrom the grave to the hardly less melancholy spectacle of the wreck.  Her\nstem was above the first arc of the flood; she was broken in two a little\nabaft the foremast--though indeed she had none, both masts having broken\nshort in her disaster; and as the pitch of the beach was very sharp and\nsudden, and the bows lay many feet below the stern, the fracture gaped\nwidely open, and you could see right through her poor hull upon the\nfarther side.  Her name was much defaced, and I could not make out\nclearly whether she was called _Christiania_, after the Norwegian city,\nor _Christiana_, after the good woman, Christian's wife, in that old book\nthe 'Pilgrim's Progress.'  By her build she was a foreign ship, but I was\nnot certain of her nationality.  She had been painted green, but the\ncolour was faded and weathered, and the paint peeling off in strips.  The\nwreck of the mainmast lay alongside, half buried in sand.  She was a\nforlorn sight, indeed, and I could not look without emotion at the bits\nof rope that still hung about her, so often handled of yore by shouting\nseamen; or the little scuttle where they had passed up and down to their\naffairs; or that poor noseless angel of a figure-head that had dipped\ninto so many running billows.\n\nI do not know whether it came most from the ship or from the grave, but I\nfell into some melancholy scruples, as I stood there, leaning with one\nhand against the battered timbers.  The homelessness of men and even of\ninanimate vessels, cast away upon strange shores, came strongly in upon\nmy mind.  To make a profit of such pitiful misadventures seemed an\nunmanly and a sordid act; and I began to think of my then quest as of\nsomething sacrilegious in its nature.  But when I remembered Mary, I took\nheart again.  My uncle would never consent to an imprudent marriage, nor\nwould she, as I was persuaded, wed without his full approval.  It behoved\nme, then, to be up and doing for my wife; and I thought with a laugh how\nlong it was since that great sea-castle, the _Espirito Santo_, had left\nher bones in Sandag Bay, and how weak it would be to consider rights so\nlong extinguished and misfortunes so long forgotten in the process of\ntime.\n\nI had my theory of where to seek for her remains.  The set of the current\nand the soundings both pointed to the east side of the bay under the\nledge of rocks.  If she had been lost in Sandag Bay, and if, after these\ncenturies, any portion of her held together, it was there that I should\nfind it.  The water deepens, as I have said, with great rapidity, and\neven close along-side the rocks several fathoms may be found.  As I\nwalked upon the edge I could see far and wide over the sandy bottom of\nthe bay; the sun shone clear and green and steady in the deeps; the bay\nseemed rather like a great transparent crystal, as one sees them in a\nlapidary's shop; there was naught to show that it was water but an\ninternal trembling, a hovering within of sun-glints and netted shadows,\nand now and then a faint lap and a dying bubble round the edge.  The\nshadows of the rocks lay out for some distance at their feet, so that my\nown shadow, moving, pausing, and stooping on the top of that, reached\nsometimes half across the bay.  It was above all in this belt of shadows\nthat I hunted for the _Espirito Santo_; since it was there the undertow\nran strongest, whether in or out.  Cool as the whole water seemed this\nbroiling day, it looked, in that part, yet cooler, and had a mysterious\ninvitation for the eyes.  Peer as I pleased, however, I could see nothing\nbut a few fishes or a bush of sea-tangle, and here and there a lump of\nrock that had fallen from above and now lay separate on the sandy floor.\nTwice did I pass from one end to the other of the rocks, and in the whole\ndistance I could see nothing of the wreck, nor any place but one where it\nwas possible for it to be.  This was a large terrace in five fathoms of\nwater, raised off the surface of the sand to a considerable height, and\nlooking from above like a mere outgrowth of the rocks on which I walked.\nIt was one mass of great sea-tangles like a grove, which prevented me\njudging of its nature, but in shape and size it bore some likeness to a\nvessel's hull.  At least it was my best chance.  If the _Espirito Santo_\nlay not there under the tangles, it lay nowhere at all in Sandag Bay; and\nI prepared to put the question to the proof, once and for all, and either\ngo back to Aros a rich man or cured for ever of my dreams of wealth.\n\nI stripped to the skin, and stood on the extreme margin with my hands\nclasped, irresolute.  The bay at that time was utterly quiet; there was\nno sound but from a school of porpoises somewhere out of sight behind the\npoint; yet a certain fear withheld me on the threshold of my venture.  Sad\nsea-feelings, scraps of my uncle's superstitions, thoughts of the dead,\nof the grave, of the old broken ships, drifted through my mind.  But the\nstrong sun upon my shoulders warmed me to the heart, and I stooped\nforward and plunged into the sea.\n\nIt was all that I could do to catch a trail of the sea-tangle that grew\nso thickly on the terrace; but once so far anchored I secured myself by\ngrasping a whole armful of these thick and slimy stalks, and, planting my\nfeet against the edge, I looked around me.  On all sides the clear sand\nstretched forth unbroken; it came to the foot of the rocks, scoured into\nthe likeness of an alley in a garden by the action of the tides; and\nbefore me, for as far as I could see, nothing was visible but the same\nmany-folded sand upon the sun-bright bottom of the bay.  Yet the terrace\nto which I was then holding was as thick with strong sea-growths as a\ntuft of heather, and the cliff from which it bulged hung draped below the\nwater-line with brown lianas.  In this complexity of forms, all swaying\ntogether in the current, things were hard to be distinguished; and I was\nstill uncertain whether my feet were pressed upon the natural rock or\nupon the timbers of the Armada treasure-ship, when the whole tuft of\ntangle came away in my hand, and in an instant I was on the surface, and\nthe shores of the bay and the bright water swam before my eyes in a glory\nof crimson.\n\nI clambered back upon the rocks, and threw the plant of tangle at my\nfeet.  Something at the same moment rang sharply, like a falling coin.  I\nstooped, and there, sure enough, crusted with the red rust, there lay an\niron shoe-buckle.  The sight of this poor human relic thrilled me to the\nheart, but not with hope nor fear, only with a desolate melancholy.  I\nheld it in my hand, and the thought of its owner appeared before me like\nthe presence of an actual man.  His weather-beaten face, his sailor's\nhands, his sea-voice hoarse with singing at the capstan, the very foot\nthat had once worn that buckle and trod so much along the swerving\ndecks--the whole human fact of him, as a creature like myself, with hair\nand blood and seeing eyes, haunted me in that sunny, solitary place, not\nlike a spectre, but like some friend whom I had basely injured.  Was the\ngreat treasure ship indeed below there, with her guns and chain and\ntreasure, as she had sailed from Spain; her decks a garden for the\nseaweed, her cabin a breeding place for fish, soundless but for the\ndredging water, motionless but for the waving of the tangle upon her\nbattlements--that old, populous, sea-riding castle, now a reef in Sandag\nBay?  Or, as I thought it likelier, was this a waif from the disaster of\nthe foreign brig--was this shoe-buckle bought but the other day and worn\nby a man of my own period in the world's history, hearing the same news\nfrom day to day, thinking the same thoughts, praying, perhaps, in the\nsame temple with myself?  However it was, I was assailed with dreary\nthoughts; my uncle's words, 'the dead are down there,' echoed in my ears;\nand though I determined to dive once more, it was with a strong\nrepugnance that I stepped forward to the margin of the rocks.\n\nA great change passed at that moment over the appearance of the bay.  It\nwas no more that clear, visible interior, like a house roofed with glass,\nwhere the green, submarine sunshine slept so stilly.  A breeze, I\nsuppose, had flawed the surface, and a sort of trouble and blackness\nfilled its bosom, where flashes of light and clouds of shadow tossed\nconfusedly together.  Even the terrace below obscurely rocked and\nquivered.  It seemed a graver thing to venture on this place of ambushes;\nand when I leaped into the sea the second time it was with a quaking in\nmy soul.\n\nI secured myself as at first, and groped among the waving tangle.  All\nthat met my touch was cold and soft and gluey.  The thicket was alive\nwith crabs and lobsters, trundling to and fro lopsidedly, and I had to\nharden my heart against the horror of their carrion neighbourhood.  On\nall sides I could feel the grain and the clefts of hard, living stone; no\nplanks, no iron, not a sign of any wreck; the _Espirito Santo_ was not\nthere.  I remember I had almost a sense of relief in my disappointment,\nand I was about ready to leave go, when something happened that sent me\nto the surface with my heart in my mouth.  I had already stayed somewhat\nlate over my explorations; the current was freshening with the change of\nthe tide, and Sandag Bay was no longer a safe place for a single swimmer.\nWell, just at the last moment there came a sudden flush of current,\ndredging through the tangles like a wave.  I lost one hold, was flung\nsprawling on my side, and, instinctively grasping for a fresh support, my\nfingers closed on something hard and cold.  I think I knew at that moment\nwhat it was.  At least I instantly left hold of the tangle, leaped for\nthe surface, and clambered out next moment on the friendly rocks with the\nbone of a man's leg in my grasp.\n\nMankind is a material creature, slow to think and dull to perceive\nconnections.  The grave, the wreck of the brig, and the rusty shoe-buckle\nwere surely plain advertisements.  A child might have read their dismal\nstory, and yet it was not until I touched that actual piece of mankind\nthat the full horror of the charnel ocean burst upon my spirit.  I laid\nthe bone beside the buckle, picked up my clothes, and ran as I was along\nthe rocks towards the human shore.  I could not be far enough from the\nspot; no fortune was vast enough to tempt me back again.  The bones of\nthe drowned dead should henceforth roll undisturbed by me, whether on\ntangle or minted gold.  But as soon as I trod the good earth again, and\nhad covered my nakedness against the sun, I knelt down over against the\nruins of the brig, and out of the fulness of my heart prayed long and\npassionately for all poor souls upon the sea.  A generous prayer is never\npresented in vain; the petition may be refused, but the petitioner is\nalways, I believe, rewarded by some gracious visitation.  The horror, at\nleast, was lifted from my mind; I could look with calm of spirit on that\ngreat bright creature, God's ocean; and as I set off homeward up the\nrough sides of Aros, nothing remained of my concern beyond a deep\ndetermination to meddle no more with the spoils of wrecked vessels or the\ntreasures of the dead.\n\nI was already some way up the hill before I paused to breathe and look\nbehind me.  The sight that met my eyes was doubly strange.\n\nFor, first, the storm that I had foreseen was now advancing with almost\ntropical rapidity.  The whole surface of the sea had been dulled from its\nconspicuous brightness to an ugly hue of corrugated lead; already in the\ndistance the white waves, the 'skipper's daughters,' had begun to flee\nbefore a breeze that was still insensible on Aros; and already along the\ncurve of Sandag Bay there was a splashing run of sea that I could hear\nfrom where I stood.  The change upon the sky was even more remarkable.\nThere had begun to arise out of the south-west a huge and solid continent\nof scowling cloud; here and there, through rents in its contexture, the\nsun still poured a sheaf of spreading rays; and here and there, from all\nits edges, vast inky streamers lay forth along the yet unclouded sky.  The\nmenace was express and imminent.  Even as I gazed, the sun was blotted\nout.  At any moment the tempest might fall upon Aros in its might.\n\nThe suddenness of this change of weather so fixed my eyes on heaven that\nit was some seconds before they alighted on the bay, mapped out below my\nfeet, and robbed a moment later of the sun.  The knoll which I had just\nsurmounted overflanked a little amphitheatre of lower hillocks sloping\ntowards the sea, and beyond that the yellow arc of beach and the whole\nextent of Sandag Bay.  It was a scene on which I had often looked down,\nbut where I had never before beheld a human figure.  I had but just\nturned my back upon it and left it empty, and my wonder may be fancied\nwhen I saw a boat and several men in that deserted spot.  The boat was\nlying by the rocks.  A pair of fellows, bareheaded, with their sleeves\nrolled up, and one with a boathook, kept her with difficulty to her\nmoorings for the current was growing brisker every moment.  A little way\noff upon the ledge two men in black clothes, whom I judged to be superior\nin rank, laid their heads together over some task which at first I did\nnot understand, but a second after I had made it out--they were taking\nbearings with the compass; and just then I saw one of them unroll a sheet\nof paper and lay his finger down, as though identifying features in a\nmap.  Meanwhile a third was walking to and fro, polling among the rocks\nand peering over the edge into the water.  While I was still watching\nthem with the stupefaction of surprise, my mind hardly yet able to work\non what my eyes reported, this third person suddenly stooped and summoned\nhis companions with a cry so loud that it reached my ears upon the hill.\nThe others ran to him, even dropping the compass in their hurry, and I\ncould see the bone and the shoe-buckle going from hand to hand, causing\nthe most unusual gesticulations of surprise and interest.  Just then I\ncould hear the seamen crying from the boat, and saw them point westward\nto that cloud continent which was ever the more rapidly unfurling its\nblackness over heaven.  The others seemed to consult; but the danger was\ntoo pressing to be braved, and they bundled into the boat carrying my\nrelies with them, and set forth out of the bay with all speed of oars.\n\nI made no more ado about the matter, but turned and ran for the house.\nWhoever these men were, it was fit my uncle should be instantly informed.\nIt was not then altogether too late in the day for a descent of the\nJacobites; and may be Prince Charlie, whom I knew my uncle to detest, was\none of the three superiors whom I had seen upon the rock.  Yet as I ran,\nleaping from rock to rock, and turned the matter loosely in my mind, this\ntheory grew ever the longer the less welcome to my reason.  The compass,\nthe map, the interest awakened by the buckle, and the conduct of that one\namong the strangers who had looked so often below him in the water, all\nseemed to point to a different explanation of their presence on that\noutlying, obscure islet of the western sea.  The Madrid historian, the\nsearch instituted by Dr. Robertson, the bearded stranger with the rings,\nmy own fruitless search that very morning in the deep water of Sandag\nBay, ran together, piece by piece, in my memory, and I made sure that\nthese strangers must be Spaniards in quest of ancient treasure and the\nlost ship of the Armada.  But the people living in outlying islands, such\nas Aros, are answerable for their own security; there is none near by to\nprotect or even to help them; and the presence in such a spot of a crew\nof foreign adventurers--poor, greedy, and most likely lawless--filled me\nwith apprehensions for my uncle's money, and even for the safety of his\ndaughter.  I was still wondering how we were to get rid of them when I\ncame, all breathless, to the top of Aros.  The whole world was shadowed\nover; only in the extreme east, on a hill of the mainland, one last gleam\nof sunshine lingered like a jewel; rain had begun to fall, not heavily,\nbut in great drops; the sea was rising with each moment, and already a\nband of white encircled Aros and the nearer coasts of Grisapol.  The boat\nwas still pulling seaward, but I now became aware of what had been hidden\nfrom me lower down--a large, heavily sparred, handsome schooner, lying to\nat the south end of Aros.  Since I had not seen her in the morning when I\nhad looked around so closely at the signs of the weather, and upon these\nlone waters where a sail was rarely visible, it was clear she must have\nlain last night behind the uninhabited Eilean Gour, and this proved\nconclusively that she was manned by strangers to our coast, for that\nanchorage, though good enough to look at, is little better than a trap\nfor ships.  With such ignorant sailors upon so wild a coast, the coming\ngale was not unlikely to bring death upon its wings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  THE GALE.\n\n\nI found my uncle at the gable end, watching the signs of the weather,\nwith a pipe in his fingers.\n\n'Uncle,' said I, 'there were men ashore at Sandag Bay--'\n\nI had no time to go further; indeed, I not only forgot my words, but even\nmy weariness, so strange was the effect on Uncle Gordon.  He dropped his\npipe and fell back against the end of the house with his jaw fallen, his\neyes staring, and his long face as white as paper.  We must have looked\nat one another silently for a quarter of a minute, before he made answer\nin this extraordinary fashion: 'Had he a hair kep on?'\n\nI knew as well as if I had been there that the man who now lay buried at\nSandag had worn a hairy cap, and that he had come ashore alive.  For the\nfirst and only time I lost toleration for the man who was my benefactor\nand the father of the woman I hoped to call my wife.\n\n'These were living men,' said I, 'perhaps Jacobites, perhaps the French,\nperhaps pirates, perhaps adventurers come here to seek the Spanish\ntreasure ship; but, whatever they may be, dangerous at least to your\ndaughter and my cousin.  As for your own guilty terrors, man, the dead\nsleeps well where you have laid him.  I stood this morning by his grave;\nhe will not wake before the trump of doom.'\n\nMy kinsman looked upon me, blinking, while I spoke; then he fixed his\neyes for a little on the ground, and pulled his fingers foolishly; but it\nwas plain that he was past the power of speech.\n\n'Come,' said I.  'You must think for others.  You must come up the hill\nwith me, and see this ship.'\n\nHe obeyed without a word or a look, following slowly after my impatient\nstrides.  The spring seemed to have gone out of his body, and he\nscrambled heavily up and down the rocks, instead of leaping, as he was\nwont, from one to another.  Nor could I, for all my cries, induce him to\nmake better haste.  Only once he replied to me complainingly, and like\none in bodily pain: 'Ay, ay, man, I'm coming.'  Long before we had\nreached the top, I had no other thought for him but pity.  If the crime\nhad been monstrous the punishment was in proportion.\n\nAt last we emerged above the sky-line of the hill, and could see around\nus.  All was black and stormy to the eye; the last gleam of sun had\nvanished; a wind had sprung up, not yet high, but gusty and unsteady to\nthe point; the rain, on the other hand, had ceased.  Short as was the\ninterval, the sea already ran vastly higher than when I had stood there\nlast; already it had begun to break over some of the outward reefs, and\nalready it moaned aloud in the sea-caves of Aros.  I looked, at first, in\nvain for the schooner.\n\n'There she is,' I said at last.  But her new position, and the course she\nwas now lying, puzzled me.  'They cannot mean to beat to sea,' I cried.\n\n'That's what they mean,' said my uncle, with something like joy; and just\nthen the schooner went about and stood upon another tack, which put the\nquestion beyond the reach of doubt.  These strangers, seeing a gale on\nhand, had thought first of sea-room.  With the wind that threatened, in\nthese reef-sown waters and contending against so violent a stream of\ntide, their course was certain death.\n\n'Good God!' said I, 'they are all lost.'\n\n'Ay,' returned my uncle, 'a'--a' lost.  They hadnae a chance but to rin\nfor Kyle Dona.  The gate they're gaun the noo, they couldnae win through\nan the muckle deil were there to pilot them.  Eh, man,' he continued,\ntouching me on the sleeve, 'it's a braw nicht for a shipwreck!  Twa in ae\ntwalmonth!  Eh, but the Merry Men'll dance bonny!'\n\nI looked at him, and it was then that I began to fancy him no longer in\nhis right mind.  He was peering up to me, as if for sympathy, a timid joy\nin his eyes.  All that had passed between us was already forgotten in the\nprospect of this fresh disaster.\n\n'If it were not too late,' I cried with indignation, 'I would take the\ncoble and go out to warn them.'\n\n'Na, na,' he protested, 'ye maunnae interfere; ye maunnae meddle wi' the\nlike o' that.  It's His'--doffing his bonnet--'His wull.  And, eh, man!\nbut it's a braw nicht for't!'\n\nSomething like fear began to creep into my soul and, reminding him that I\nhad not yet dined, I proposed we should return to the house.  But no;\nnothing would tear him from his place of outlook.\n\n'I maun see the hail thing, man, Cherlie,' he explained--and then as the\nschooner went about a second time, 'Eh, but they han'le her bonny!' he\ncried.  'The _Christ-Anna_ was naething to this.'\n\nAlready the men on board the schooner must have begun to realise some\npart, but not yet the twentieth, of the dangers that environed their\ndoomed ship.  At every lull of the capricious wind they must have seen\nhow fast the current swept them back.  Each tack was made shorter, as\nthey saw how little it prevailed.  Every moment the rising swell began to\nboom and foam upon another sunken reef; and ever and again a breaker\nwould fall in sounding ruin under the very bows of her, and the brown\nreef and streaming tangle appear in the hollow of the wave.  I tell you,\nthey had to stand to their tackle: there was no idle men aboard that\nship, God knows.  It was upon the progress of a scene so horrible to any\nhuman-hearted man that my misguided uncle now pored and gloated like a\nconnoisseur.  As I turned to go down the hill, he was lying on his belly\non the summit, with his hands stretched forth and clutching in the\nheather.  He seemed rejuvenated, mind and body.\n\nWhen I got back to the house already dismally affected, I was still more\nsadly downcast at the sight of Mary.  She had her sleeves rolled up over\nher strong arms, and was quietly making bread.  I got a bannock from the\ndresser and sat down to eat it in silence.\n\n'Are ye wearied, lad?' she asked after a while.\n\n'I am not so much wearied, Mary,' I replied, getting on my feet, 'as I am\nweary of delay, and perhaps of Aros too.  You know me well enough to\njudge me fairly, say what I like.  Well, Mary, you may be sure of this:\nyou had better be anywhere but here.'\n\n'I'll be sure of one thing,' she returned: 'I'll be where my duty is.'\n\n'You forget, you have a duty to yourself,' I said.\n\n'Ay, man?' she replied, pounding at the dough; 'will you have found that\nin the Bible, now?'\n\n'Mary,' I said solemnly, 'you must not laugh at me just now.  God knows I\nam in no heart for laughing.  If we could get your father with us, it\nwould be best; but with him or without him, I want you far away from\nhere, my girl; for your own sake, and for mine, ay, and for your father's\ntoo, I want you far--far away from here.  I came with other thoughts; I\ncame here as a man comes home; now it is all changed, and I have no\ndesire nor hope but to flee--for that's the word--flee, like a bird out\nof the fowler's snare, from this accursed island.'\n\nShe had stopped her work by this time.\n\n'And do you think, now,' said she, 'do you think, now, I have neither\neyes nor ears?  Do ye think I havenae broken my heart to have these braws\n(as he calls them, God forgive him!) thrown into the sea?  Do ye think I\nhave lived with him, day in, day out, and not seen what you saw in an\nhour or two?  No,' she said, 'I know there's wrong in it; what wrong, I\nneither know nor want to know.  There was never an ill thing made better\nby meddling, that I could hear of.  But, my lad, you must never ask me to\nleave my father.  While the breath is in his body, I'll be with him.  And\nhe's not long for here, either: that I can tell you, Charlie--he's not\nlong for here.  The mark is on his brow; and better so--maybe better so.'\n\nI was a while silent, not knowing what to say; and when I roused my head\nat last to speak, she got before me.\n\n'Charlie,' she said, 'what's right for me, neednae be right for you.\nThere's sin upon this house and trouble; you are a stranger; take your\nthings upon your back and go your ways to better places and to better\nfolk, and if you were ever minded to come back, though it were twenty\nyears syne, you would find me aye waiting.'\n\n'Mary Ellen,' I said, 'I asked you to be my wife, and you said as good as\nyes.  That's done for good.  Wherever you are, I am; as I shall answer to\nmy God.'\n\nAs I said the words, the wind suddenly burst out raving, and then seemed\nto stand still and shudder round the house of Aros.  It was the first\nsquall, or prologue, of the coming tempest, and as we started and looked\nabout us, we found that a gloom, like the approach of evening, had\nsettled round the house.\n\n'God pity all poor folks at sea!' she said.  'We'll see no more of my\nfather till the morrow's morning.'\n\nAnd then she told me, as we sat by the fire and hearkened to the rising\ngusts, of how this change had fallen upon my uncle.  All last winter he\nhad been dark and fitful in his mind.  Whenever the Roost ran high, or,\nas Mary said, whenever the Merry Men were dancing, he would lie out for\nhours together on the Head, if it were at night, or on the top of Aros by\nday, watching the tumult of the sea, and sweeping the horizon for a sail.\nAfter February the tenth, when the wealth-bringing wreck was cast ashore\nat Sandag, he had been at first unnaturally gay, and his excitement had\nnever fallen in degree, but only changed in kind from dark to darker.  He\nneglected his work, and kept Rorie idle.  They two would speak together\nby the hour at the gable end, in guarded tones and with an air of secrecy\nand almost of guilt; and if she questioned either, as at first she\nsometimes did, her inquiries were put aside with confusion.  Since Rorie\nhad first remarked the fish that hung about the ferry, his master had\nnever set foot but once upon the mainland of the Ross.  That once--it was\nin the height of the springs--he had passed dryshod while the tide was\nout; but, having lingered overlong on the far side, found himself cut off\nfrom Aros by the returning waters.  It was with a shriek of agony that he\nhad leaped across the gut, and he had reached home thereafter in a fever-\nfit of fear.  A fear of the sea, a constant haunting thought of the sea,\nappeared in his talk and devotions, and even in his looks when he was\nsilent.\n\nRorie alone came in to supper; but a little later my uncle appeared, took\na bottle under his arm, put some bread in his pocket, and set forth again\nto his outlook, followed this time by Rorie.  I heard that the schooner\nwas losing ground, but the crew were still fighting every inch with\nhopeless ingenuity and course; and the news filled my mind with\nblackness.\n\nA little after sundown the full fury of the gale broke forth, such a gale\nas I have never seen in summer, nor, seeing how swiftly it had come, even\nin winter.  Mary and I sat in silence, the house quaking overhead, the\ntempest howling without, the fire between us sputtering with raindrops.\nOur thoughts were far away with the poor fellows on the schooner, or my\nnot less unhappy uncle, houseless on the promontory; and yet ever and\nagain we were startled back to ourselves, when the wind would rise and\nstrike the gable like a solid body, or suddenly fall and draw away, so\nthat the fire leaped into flame and our hearts bounded in our sides.  Now\nthe storm in its might would seize and shake the four corners of the\nroof, roaring like Leviathan in anger.  Anon, in a lull, cold eddies of\ntempest moved shudderingly in the room, lifting the hair upon our heads\nand passing between us as we sat.  And again the wind would break forth\nin a chorus of melancholy sounds, hooting low in the chimney, wailing\nwith flutelike softness round the house.\n\nIt was perhaps eight o'clock when Rorie came in and pulled me\nmysteriously to the door.  My uncle, it appeared, had frightened even his\nconstant comrade; and Rorie, uneasy at his extravagance, prayed me to\ncome out and share the watch.  I hastened to do as I was asked; the more\nreadily as, what with fear and horror, and the electrical tension of the\nnight, I was myself restless and disposed for action.  I told Mary to be\nunder no alarm, for I should be a safeguard on her father; and wrapping\nmyself warmly in a plaid, I followed Rorie into the open air.\n\nThe night, though we were so little past midsummer, was as dark as\nJanuary.  Intervals of a groping twilight alternated with spells of utter\nblackness; and it was impossible to trace the reason of these changes in\nthe flying horror of the sky.  The wind blew the breath out of a man's\nnostrils; all heaven seemed to thunder overhead like one huge sail; and\nwhen there fell a momentary lull on Aros, we could hear the gusts\ndismally sweeping in the distance.  Over all the lowlands of the Ross,\nthe wind must have blown as fierce as on the open sea; and God only knows\nthe uproar that was raging around the head of Ben Kyaw.  Sheets of\nmingled spray and rain were driven in our faces.  All round the isle of\nAros the surf, with an incessant, hammering thunder, beat upon the reefs\nand beaches.  Now louder in one place, now lower in another, like the\ncombinations of orchestral music, the constant mass of sound was hardly\nvaried for a moment.  And loud above all this hurly-burly I could hear\nthe changeful voices of the Roost and the intermittent roaring of the\nMerry Men.  At that hour, there flashed into my mind the reason of the\nname that they were called.  For the noise of them seemed almost\nmirthful, as it out-topped the other noises of the night; or if not\nmirthful, yet instinct with a portentous joviality.  Nay, and it seemed\neven human.  As when savage men have drunk away their reason, and,\ndiscarding speech, bawl together in their madness by the hour; so, to my\nears, these deadly breakers shouted by Aros in the night.\n\nArm in arm, and staggering against the wind, Rorie and I won every yard\nof ground with conscious effort.  We slipped on the wet sod, we fell\ntogether sprawling on the rocks.  Bruised, drenched, beaten, and\nbreathless, it must have taken us near half an hour to get from the house\ndown to the Head that overlooks the Roost.  There, it seemed, was my\nuncle's favourite observatory.  Right in the face of it, where the cliff\nis highest and most sheer, a hump of earth, like a parapet, makes a place\nof shelter from the common winds, where a man may sit in quiet and see\nthe tide and the mad billows contending at his feet.  As he might look\ndown from the window of a house upon some street disturbance, so, from\nthis post, he looks down upon the tumbling of the Merry Men.  On such a\nnight, of course, he peers upon a world of blackness, where the waters\nwheel and boil, where the waves joust together with the noise of an\nexplosion, and the foam towers and vanishes in the twinkling of an eye.\nNever before had I seen the Merry Men thus violent.  The fury, height,\nand transiency of their spoutings was a thing to be seen and not\nrecounted.  High over our heads on the cliff rose their white columns in\nthe darkness; and the same instant, like phantoms, they were gone.\nSometimes three at a time would thus aspire and vanish; sometimes a gust\ntook them, and the spray would fall about us, heavy as a wave.  And yet\nthe spectacle was rather maddening in its levity than impressive by its\nforce.  Thought was beaten down by the confounding uproar--a gleeful\nvacancy possessed the brains of men, a state akin to madness; and I found\nmyself at times following the dance of the Merry Men as it were a tune\nupon a jigging instrument.\n\nI first caught sight of my uncle when we were still some yards away in\none of the flying glimpses of twilight that chequered the pitch darkness\nof the night.  He was standing up behind the parapet, his head thrown\nback and the bottle to his mouth.  As he put it down, he saw and\nrecognised us with a toss of one hand fleeringly above his head.\n\n'Has he been drinking?' shouted I to Rorie.\n\n'He will aye be drunk when the wind blaws,' returned Rorie in the same\nhigh key, and it was all that I could do to hear him.\n\n'Then--was he so--in February?' I inquired.\n\nRorie's 'Ay' was a cause of joy to me.  The murder, then, had not sprung\nin cold blood from calculation; it was an act of madness no more to be\ncondemned than to be pardoned.  My uncle was a dangerous madman, if you\nwill, but he was not cruel and base as I had feared.  Yet what a scene\nfor a carouse, what an incredible vice, was this that the poor man had\nchosen!  I have always thought drunkenness a wild and almost fearful\npleasure, rather demoniacal than human; but drunkenness, out here in the\nroaring blackness, on the edge of a cliff above that hell of waters, the\nman's head spinning like the Roost, his foot tottering on the edge of\ndeath, his ear watching for the signs of ship-wreck, surely that, if it\nwere credible in any one, was morally impossible in a man like my uncle,\nwhose mind was set upon a damnatory creed and haunted by the darkest\nsuperstitions.  Yet so it was; and, as we reached the bight of shelter\nand could breathe again, I saw the man's eyes shining in the night with\nan unholy glimmer.\n\n'Eh, Charlie, man, it's grand!' he cried.  'See to them!' he continued,\ndragging me to the edge of the abyss from whence arose that deafening\nclamour and those clouds of spray; 'see to them dancin', man!  Is that no\nwicked?'\n\nHe pronounced the word with gusto, and I thought it suited with the\nscene.\n\n'They're yowlin' for thon schooner,' he went on, his thin, insane voice\nclearly audible in the shelter of the bank, 'an' she's comin' aye nearer,\naye nearer, aye nearer an' nearer an' nearer; an' they ken't, the folk\nkens it, they ken wool it's by wi' them.  Charlie, lad, they're a' drunk\nin yon schooner, a' dozened wi' drink.  They were a' drunk in the _Christ-\nAnna_, at the hinder end.  There's nane could droon at sea wantin' the\nbrandy.  Hoot awa, what do you ken?' with a sudden blast of anger.  'I\ntell ye, it cannae be; they droon withoot it.  Ha'e,' holding out the\nbottle, 'tak' a sowp.'\n\nI was about to refuse, but Rorie touched me as if in warning; and indeed\nI had already thought better of the movement.  I took the bottle,\ntherefore, and not only drank freely myself, but contrived to spill even\nmore as I was doing so.  It was pure spirit, and almost strangled me to\nswallow.  My kinsman did not observe the loss, but, once more throwing\nback his head, drained the remainder to the dregs.  Then, with a loud\nlaugh, he cast the bottle forth among the Merry Men, who seemed to leap\nup, shouting to receive it.\n\n'Ha'e, bairns!' he cried, 'there's your han'sel.  Ye'll get bonnier nor\nthat, or morning.'\n\nSuddenly, out in the black night before us, and not two hundred yards\naway, we heard, at a moment when the wind was silent, the clear note of a\nhuman voice.  Instantly the wind swept howling down upon the Head, and\nthe Roost bellowed, and churned, and danced with a new fury.  But we had\nheard the sound, and we knew, with agony, that this was the doomed ship\nnow close on ruin, and that what we had heard was the voice of her master\nissuing his last command.  Crouching together on the edge, we waited,\nstraining every sense, for the inevitable end.  It was long, however, and\nto us it seemed like ages, ere the schooner suddenly appeared for one\nbrief instant, relieved against a tower of glimmering foam.  I still see\nher reefed mainsail flapping loose, as the boom fell heavily across the\ndeck; I still see the black outline of the hull, and still think I can\ndistinguish the figure of a man stretched upon the tiller.  Yet the whole\nsight we had of her passed swifter than lightning; the very wave that\ndisclosed her fell burying her for ever; the mingled cry of many voices\nat the point of death rose and was quenched in the roaring of the Merry\nMen.  And with that the tragedy was at an end.  The strong ship, with all\nher gear, and the lamp perhaps still burning in the cabin, the lives of\nso many men, precious surely to others, dear, at least, as heaven to\nthemselves, had all, in that one moment, gone down into the surging\nwaters.  They were gone like a dream.  And the wind still ran and\nshouted, and the senseless waters in the Roost still leaped and tumbled\nas before.\n\nHow long we lay there together, we three, speechless and motionless, is\nmore than I can tell, but it must have been for long.  At length, one by\none, and almost mechanically, we crawled back into the shelter of the\nbank.  As I lay against the parapet, wholly wretched and not entirely\nmaster of my mind, I could hear my kinsman maundering to himself in an\naltered and melancholy mood.  Now he would repeat to himself with maudlin\niteration, 'Sic a fecht as they had--sic a sair fecht as they had, puir\nlads, puir lads!' and anon he would bewail that 'a' the gear was as\ngude's tint,' because the ship had gone down among the Merry Men instead\nof stranding on the shore; and throughout, the name--the\n_Christ-Anna_--would come and go in his divagations, pronounced with\nshuddering awe.  The storm all this time was rapidly abating.  In half an\nhour the wind had fallen to a breeze, and the change was accompanied or\ncaused by a heavy, cold, and plumping rain.  I must then have fallen\nasleep, and when I came to myself, drenched, stiff, and unrefreshed, day\nhad already broken, grey, wet, discomfortable day; the wind blew in faint\nand shifting capfuls, the tide was out, the Roost was at its lowest, and\nonly the strong beating surf round all the coasts of Aros remained to\nwitness of the furies of the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  A MAN OUT OF THE SEA.\n\n\nRorie set out for the house in search of warmth and breakfast; but my\nuncle was bent upon examining the shores of Aros, and I felt it a part of\nduty to accompany him throughout.  He was now docile and quiet, but\ntremulous and weak in mind and body; and it was with the eagerness of a\nchild that he pursued his exploration.  He climbed far down upon the\nrocks; on the beaches, he pursued the retreating breakers.  The merest\nbroken plank or rag of cordage was a treasure in his eyes to be secured\nat the peril of his life.  To see him, with weak and stumbling footsteps,\nexpose himself to the pursuit of the surf, or the snares and pitfalls of\nthe weedy rock, kept me in a perpetual terror.  My arm was ready to\nsupport him, my hand clutched him by the skirt, I helped him to draw his\npitiful discoveries beyond the reach of the returning wave; a nurse\naccompanying a child of seven would have had no different experience.\n\nYet, weakened as he was by the reaction from his madness of the night\nbefore, the passions that smouldered in his nature were those of a strong\nman.  His terror of the sea, although conquered for the moment, was still\nundiminished; had the sea been a lake of living flames, he could not have\nshrunk more panically from its touch; and once, when his foot slipped and\nhe plunged to the midleg into a pool of water, the shriek that came up\nout of his soul was like the cry of death.  He sat still for a while,\npanting like a dog, after that; but his desire for the spoils of\nshipwreck triumphed once more over his fears; once more he tottered among\nthe curded foam; once more he crawled upon the rocks among the bursting\nbubbles; once more his whole heart seemed to be set on driftwood, fit, if\nit was fit for anything, to throw upon the fire.  Pleased as he was with\nwhat he found, he still incessantly grumbled at his ill-fortune.\n\n'Aros,' he said, 'is no a place for wrecks ava'--no ava'.  A' the years\nI've dwalt here, this ane maks the second; and the best o' the gear clean\ntint!'\n\n'Uncle,' said I, for we were now on a stretch of open sand, where there\nwas nothing to divert his mind, 'I saw you last night, as I never thought\nto see you--you were drunk.'\n\n'Na, na,' he said, 'no as bad as that.  I had been drinking, though.  And\nto tell ye the God's truth, it's a thing I cannae mend.  There's nae\nsoberer man than me in my ordnar; but when I hear the wind blaw in my\nlug, it's my belief that I gang gyte.'\n\n'You are a religious man,' I replied, 'and this is sin'.\n\n'Ou,' he returned, 'if it wasnae sin, I dinnae ken that I would care\nfor't.  Ye see, man, it's defiance.  There's a sair spang o' the auld sin\no' the warld in you sea; it's an unchristian business at the best o't;\nan' whiles when it gets up, an' the wind skreights--the wind an' her are\na kind of sib, I'm thinkin'--an' thae Merry Men, the daft callants,\nblawin' and lauchin', and puir souls in the deid thraws warstlin' the\nleelang nicht wi' their bit ships--weel, it comes ower me like a glamour.\nI'm a deil, I ken't.  But I think naething o' the puir sailor lads; I'm\nwi' the sea, I'm just like ane o' her ain Merry Men.'\n\nI thought I should touch him in a joint of his harness.  I turned me\ntowards the sea; the surf was running gaily, wave after wave, with their\nmanes blowing behind them, riding one after another up the beach,\ntowering, curving, falling one upon another on the trampled sand.\nWithout, the salt air, the scared gulls, the widespread army of the sea-\nchargers, neighing to each other, as they gathered together to the\nassault of Aros; and close before us, that line on the flat sands that,\nwith all their number and their fury, they might never pass.\n\n'Thus far shalt thou go,' said I, 'and no farther.'  And then I quoted as\nsolemnly as I was able a verse that I had often before fitted to the\nchorus of the breakers:--\n\n   But yet the Lord that is on high,\n      Is more of might by far,\n   Than noise of many waters is,\n      As great sea billows are.\n\n'Ay,' said my kinsinan, 'at the hinder end, the Lord will triumph; I\ndinnae misdoobt that.  But here on earth, even silly men-folk daur Him to\nHis face.  It is nae wise; I am nae sayin' that it's wise; but it's the\npride of the eye, and it's the lust o' life, an' it's the wale o'\npleesures.'\n\nI said no more, for we had now begun to cross a neck of land that lay\nbetween us and Sandag; and I withheld my last appeal to the man's better\nreason till we should stand upon the spot associated with his crime.  Nor\ndid he pursue the subject; but he walked beside me with a firmer step.\nThe call that I had made upon his mind acted like a stimulant, and I\ncould see that he had forgotten his search for worthless jetsam, in a\nprofound, gloomy, and yet stirring train of thought.  In three or four\nminutes we had topped the brae and begun to go down upon Sandag.  The\nwreck had been roughly handled by the sea; the stem had been spun round\nand dragged a little lower down; and perhaps the stern had been forced a\nlittle higher, for the two parts now lay entirely separate on the beach.\nWhen we came to the grave I stopped, uncovered my head in the thick rain,\nand, looking my kinsman in the face, addressed him.\n\n'A man,' said I, 'was in God's providence suffered to escape from mortal\ndangers; he was poor, he was naked, he was wet, he was weary, he was a\nstranger; he had every claim upon the bowels of your compassion; it may\nbe that he was the salt of the earth, holy, helpful, and kind; it may be\nhe was a man laden with iniquities to whom death was the beginning of\ntorment.  I ask you in the sight of heaven: Gordon Darnaway, where is the\nman for whom Christ died?'\n\nHe started visibly at the last words; but there came no answer, and his\nface expressed no feeling but a vague alarm.\n\n'You were my father's brother,' I continued; 'You, have taught me to\ncount your house as if it were my father's house; and we are both sinful\nmen walking before the Lord among the sins and dangers of this life.  It\nis by our evil that God leads us into good; we sin, I dare not say by His\ntemptation, but I must say with His consent; and to any but the brutish\nman his sins are the beginning of wisdom.  God has warned you by this\ncrime; He warns you still by the bloody grave between our feet; and if\nthere shall follow no repentance, no improvement, no return to Him, what\ncan we look for but the following of some memorable judgment?'\n\nEven as I spoke the words, the eyes of my uncle wandered from my face.  A\nchange fell upon his looks that cannot be described; his features seemed\nto dwindle in size, the colour faded from his cheeks, one hand rose\nwaveringly and pointed over my shoulder into the distance, and the oft-\nrepeated name fell once more from his lips: 'The _Christ-Anna_!'\n\nI turned; and if I was not appalled to the same degree, as I return\nthanks to Heaven that I had not the cause, I was still startled by the\nsight that met my eyes.  The form of a man stood upright on the cabin-\nhutch of the wrecked ship; his back was towards us; he appeared to be\nscanning the offing with shaded eyes, and his figure was relieved to its\nfull height, which was plainly very great, against the sea and sky.  I\nhave said a thousand times that I am not superstitious; but at that\nmoment, with my mind running upon death and sin, the unexplained\nappearance of a stranger on that sea-girt, solitary island filled me with\na surprise that bordered close on terror.  It seemed scarce possible that\nany human soul should have come ashore alive in such a sea as had rated\nlast night along the coasts of Aros; and the only vessel within miles had\ngone down before our eyes among the Merry Men.  I was assailed with\ndoubts that made suspense unbearable, and, to put the matter to the touch\nat once, stepped forward and hailed the figure like a ship.\n\nHe turned about, and I thought he started to behold us.  At this my\ncourage instantly revived, and I called and signed to him to draw near,\nand he, on his part, dropped immediately to the sands, and began slowly\nto approach, with many stops and hesitations.  At each repeated mark of\nthe man's uneasiness I grew the more confident myself; and I advanced\nanother step, encouraging him as I did so with my head and hand.  It was\nplain the castaway had heard indifferent accounts of our island\nhospitality; and indeed, about this time, the people farther north had a\nsorry reputation.\n\n'Why,' I said, 'the man is black!'\n\nAnd just at that moment, in a voice that I could scarce have recognised,\nmy kinsman began swearing and praying in a mingled stream.  I looked at\nhim; he had fallen on his knees, his face was agonised; at each step of\nthe castaway's the pitch of his voice rose, the volubility of his\nutterance and the fervour of his language redoubled.  I call it prayer,\nfor it was addressed to God; but surely no such ranting incongruities\nwere ever before addressed to the Creator by a creature: surely if prayer\ncan be a sin, this mad harangue was sinful.  I ran to my kinsman, I\nseized him by the shoulders, I dragged him to his feet.\n\n'Silence, man,' said I, 'respect your God in words, if not in action.\nHere, on the very scene of your transgressions, He sends you an occasion\nof atonement.  Forward and embrace it; welcome like a father yon creature\nwho comes trembling to your mercy.'\n\nWith that, I tried to force him towards the black; but he felled me to\nthe ground, burst from my grasp, leaving the shoulder of his jacket, and\nfled up the hillside towards the top of Aros like a deer.  I staggered to\nmy feet again, bruised and somewhat stunned; the negro had paused in\nsurprise, perhaps in terror, some halfway between me and the wreck; my\nuncle was already far away, bounding from rock to rock; and I thus found\nmyself torn for a time between two duties.  But I judged, and I pray\nHeaven that I judged rightly, in favour of the poor wretch upon the\nsands; his misfortune was at least not plainly of his own creation; it\nwas one, besides, that I could certainly relieve; and I had begun by that\ntime to regard my uncle as an incurable and dismal lunatic.  I advanced\naccordingly towards the black, who now awaited my approach with folded\narms, like one prepared for either destiny.  As I came nearer, he reached\nforth his hand with a great gesture, such as I had seen from the pulpit,\nand spoke to me in something of a pulpit voice, but not a word was\ncomprehensible.  I tried him first in English, then in Gaelic, both in\nvain; so that it was clear we must rely upon the tongue of looks and\ngestures.  Thereupon I signed to him to follow me, which he did readily\nand with a grave obeisance like a fallen king; all the while there had\ncome no shade of alteration in his face, neither of anxiety while he was\nstill waiting, nor of relief now that he was reassured; if he were a\nslave, as I supposed, I could not but judge he must have fallen from some\nhigh place in his own country, and fallen as he was, I could not but\nadmire his bearing.  As we passed the grave, I paused and raised my hands\nand eyes to heaven in token of respect and sorrow for the dead; and he,\nas if in answer, bowed low and spread his hands abroad; it was a strange\nmotion, but done like a thing of common custom; and I supposed it was\nceremonial in the land from which he came.  At the same time he pointed\nto my uncle, whom we could just see perched upon a knoll, and touched his\nhead to indicate that he was mad.\n\nWe took the long way round the shore, for I feared to excite my uncle if\nwe struck across the island; and as we walked, I had time enough to\nmature the little dramatic exhibition by which I hoped to satisfy my\ndoubts.  Accordingly, pausing on a rock, I proceeded to imitate before\nthe negro the action of the man whom I had seen the day before taking\nbearings with the compass at Sandag.  He understood me at once, and,\ntaking the imitation out of my hands, showed me where the boat was,\npointed out seaward as if to indicate the position of the schooner, and\nthen down along the edge of the rock with the words 'Espirito Santo,'\nstrangely pronounced, but clear enough for recognition.  I had thus been\nright in my conjecture; the pretended historical inquiry had been but a\ncloak for treasure-hunting; the man who had played on Dr. Robertson was\nthe same as the foreigner who visited Grisapol in spring, and now, with\nmany others, lay dead under the Roost of Aros: there had their greed\nbrought them, there should their bones be tossed for evermore.  In the\nmeantime the black continued his imitation of the scene, now looking up\nskyward as though watching the approach of the storm now, in the\ncharacter of a seaman, waving the rest to come aboard; now as an officer,\nrunning along the rock and entering the boat; and anon bending over\nimaginary oars with the air of a hurried boatman; but all with the same\nsolemnity of manner, so that I was never even moved to smile.  Lastly, he\nindicated to me, by a pantomime not to be described in words, how he\nhimself had gone up to examine the stranded wreck, and, to his grief and\nindignation, had been deserted by his comrades; and thereupon folded his\narms once more, and stooped his head, like one accepting fate.\n\nThe mystery of his presence being thus solved for me, I explained to him\nby means of a sketch the fate of the vessel and of all aboard her.  He\nshowed no surprise nor sorrow, and, with a sudden lifting of his open\nhand, seemed to dismiss his former friends or masters (whichever they had\nbeen) into God's pleasure.  Respect came upon me and grew stronger, the\nmore I observed him; I saw he had a powerful mind and a sober and severe\ncharacter, such as I loved to commune with; and before we reached the\nhouse of Aros I had almost forgotten, and wholly forgiven him, his\nuncanny colour.\n\nTo Mary I told all that had passed without suppression, though I own my\nheart failed me; but I did wrong to doubt her sense of justice.\n\n'You did the right,' she said.  'God's will be done.'  And she set out\nmeat for us at once.\n\nAs soon as I was satisfied, I bade Rorie keep an eye upon the castaway,\nwho was still eating, and set forth again myself to find my uncle.  I had\nnot gone far before I saw him sitting in the same place, upon the very\ntopmost knoll, and seemingly in the same attitude as when I had last\nobserved him.  From that point, as I have said, the most of Aros and the\nneighbouring Ross would be spread below him like a map; and it was plain\nthat he kept a bright look-out in all directions, for my head had\nscarcely risen above the summit of the first ascent before he had leaped\nto his feet and turned as if to face me.  I hailed him at once, as well\nas I was able, in the same tones and words as I had often used before,\nwhen I had come to summon him to dinner.  He made not so much as a\nmovement in reply.  I passed on a little farther, and again tried parley,\nwith the same result.  But when I began a second time to advance, his\ninsane fears blazed up again, and still in dead silence, but with\nincredible speed, he began to flee from before me along the rocky summit\nof the hill.  An hour before, he had been dead weary, and I had been\ncomparatively active.  But now his strength was recruited by the fervour\nof insanity, and it would have been vain for me to dream of pursuit.  Nay,\nthe very attempt, I thought, might have inflamed his terrors, and thus\nincreased the miseries of our position.  And I had nothing left but to\nturn homeward and make my sad report to Mary.\n\nShe heard it, as she had heard the first, with a concerned composure,\nand, bidding me lie down and take that rest of which I stood so much in\nneed, set forth herself in quest of her misguided father.  At that age it\nwould have been a strange thing that put me from either meat or sleep; I\nslept long and deep; and it was already long past noon before I awoke and\ncame downstairs into the kitchen.  Mary, Rorie, and the black castaway\nwere seated about the fire in silence; and I could see that Mary had been\nweeping.  There was cause enough, as I soon learned, for tears.  First\nshe, and then Rorie, had been forth to seek my uncle; each in turn had\nfound him perched upon the hill-top, and from each in turn he had\nsilently and swiftly fled.  Rorie had tried to chase him, but in vain;\nmadness lent a new vigour to his bounds; he sprang from rock to rock over\nthe widest gullies; he scoured like the wind along the hill-tops; he\ndoubled and twisted like a hare before the dogs; and Rorie at length gave\nin; and the last that he saw, my uncle was seated as before upon the\ncrest of Aros.  Even during the hottest excitement of the chase, even\nwhen the fleet-footed servant had come, for a moment, very near to\ncapture him, the poor lunatic had uttered not a sound.  He fled, and he\nwas silent, like a beast; and this silence had terrified his pursuer.\n\nThere was something heart-breaking in the situation.  How to capture the\nmadman, how to feed him in the meanwhile, and what to do with him when he\nwas captured, were the three difficulties that we had to solve.\n\n'The black,' said I, 'is the cause of this attack.  It may even be his\npresence in the house that keeps my uncle on the hill.  We have done the\nfair thing; he has been fed and warmed under this roof; now I propose\nthat Rorie put him across the bay in the coble, and take him through the\nRoss as far as Grisapol.'\n\nIn this proposal Mary heartily concurred; and bidding the black follow\nus, we all three descended to the pier.  Certainly, Heaven's will was\ndeclared against Gordon Darnaway; a thing had happened, never paralleled\nbefore in Aros; during the storm, the coble had broken loose, and,\nstriking on the rough splinters of the pier, now lay in four feet of\nwater with one side stove in.  Three days of work at least would be\nrequired to make her float.  But I was not to be beaten.  I led the whole\nparty round to where the gut was narrowest, swam to the other side, and\ncalled to the black to follow me.  He signed, with the same clearness and\nquiet as before, that he knew not the art; and there was truth apparent\nin his signals, it would have occurred to none of us to doubt his truth;\nand that hope being over, we must all go back even as we came to the\nhouse of Aros, the negro walking in our midst without embarrassment.\n\nAll we could do that day was to make one more attempt to communicate with\nthe unhappy madman.  Again he was visible on his perch; again he fled in\nsilence.  But food and a great cloak were at least left for his comfort;\nthe rain, besides, had cleared away, and the night promised to be even\nwarm.  We might compose ourselves, we thought, until the morrow; rest was\nthe chief requisite, that we might be strengthened for unusual exertions;\nand as none cared to talk, we separated at an early hour.\n\nI lay long awake, planning a campaign for the morrow.  I was to place the\nblack on the side of Sandag, whence he should head my uncle towards the\nhouse; Rorie in the west, I on the east, were to complete the cordon, as\nbest we might.  It seemed to me, the more I recalled the configuration of\nthe island, that it should be possible, though hard, to force him down\nupon the low ground along Aros Bay; and once there, even with the\nstrength of his madness, ultimate escape was hardly to be feared.  It was\non his terror of the black that I relied; for I made sure, however he\nmight run, it would not be in the direction of the man whom he supposed\nto have returned from the dead, and thus one point of the compass at\nleast would be secure.\n\nWhen at length I fell asleep, it was to be awakened shortly after by a\ndream of wrecks, black men, and submarine adventure; and I found myself\nso shaken and fevered that I arose, descended the stair, and stepped out\nbefore the house.  Within, Rorie and the black were asleep together in\nthe kitchen; outside was a wonderful clear night of stars, with here and\nthere a cloud still hanging, last stragglers of the tempest.  It was near\nthe top of the flood, and the Merry Men were roaring in the windless\nquiet of the night.  Never, not even in the height of the tempest, had I\nheard their song with greater awe.  Now, when the winds were gathered\nhome, when the deep was dandling itself back into its summer slumber, and\nwhen the stars rained their gentle light over land and sea, the voice of\nthese tide-breakers was still raised for havoc.  They seemed, indeed, to\nbe a part of the world's evil and the tragic side of life.  Nor were\ntheir meaningless vociferations the only sounds that broke the silence of\nthe night.  For I could hear, now shrill and thrilling and now almost\ndrowned, the note of a human voice that accompanied the uproar of the\nRoost.  I knew it for my kinsman's; and a great fear fell upon me of\nGod's judgments, and the evil in the world.  I went back again into the\ndarkness of the house as into a place of shelter, and lay long upon my\nbed, pondering these mysteries.\n\nIt was late when I again woke, and I leaped into my clothes and hurried\nto the kitchen.  No one was there; Rorie and the black had both\nstealthily departed long before; and my heart stood still at the\ndiscovery.  I could rely on Rorie's heart, but I placed no trust in his\ndiscretion.  If he had thus set out without a word, he was plainly bent\nupon some service to my uncle.  But what service could he hope to render\neven alone, far less in the company of the man in whom my uncle found his\nfears incarnated?  Even if I were not already too late to prevent some\ndeadly mischief, it was plain I must delay no longer.  With the thought I\nwas out of the house; and often as I have run on the rough sides of Aros,\nI never ran as I did that fatal morning.  I do not believe I put twelve\nminutes to the whole ascent.\n\nMy uncle was gone from his perch.  The basket had indeed been torn open\nand the meat scattered on the turf; but, as we found afterwards, no\nmouthful had been tasted; and there was not another trace of human\nexistence in that wide field of view.  Day had already filled the clear\nheavens; the sun already lighted in a rosy bloom upon the crest of Ben\nKyaw; but all below me the rude knolls of Aros and the shield of sea lay\nsteeped in the clear darkling twilight of the dawn.\n\n'Rorie!' I cried; and again 'Rorie!'  My voice died in the silence, but\nthere came no answer back.  If there were indeed an enterprise afoot to\ncatch my uncle, it was plainly not in fleetness of foot, but in dexterity\nof stalking, that the hunters placed their trust.  I ran on farther,\nkeeping the higher spurs, and looking right and left, nor did I pause\nagain till I was on the mount above Sandag.  I could see the wreck, the\nuncovered belt of sand, the waves idly beating, the long ledge of rocks,\nand on either hand the tumbled knolls, boulders, and gullies of the\nisland.  But still no human thing.\n\nAt a stride the sunshine fell on Aros, and the shadows and colours leaped\ninto being.  Not half a moment later, below me to the west, sheep began\nto scatter as in a panic.  There came a cry.  I saw my uncle running.  I\nsaw the black jump up in hot pursuit; and before I had time to\nunderstand, Rorie also had appeared, calling directions in Gaelic as to a\ndog herding sheep.\n\nI took to my heels to interfere, and perhaps I had done better to have\nwaited where I was, for I was the means of cutting off the madman's last\nescape.  There was nothing before him from that moment but the grave, the\nwreck, and the sea in Sandag Bay.  And yet Heaven knows that what I did\nwas for the best.\n\nMy uncle Gordon saw in what direction, horrible to him, the chase was\ndriving him.  He doubled, darting to the right and left; but high as the\nfever ran in his veins, the black was still the swifter.  Turn where he\nwould, he was still forestalled, still driven toward the scene of his\ncrime.  Suddenly he began to shriek aloud, so that the coast re-echoed;\nand now both I and Rorie were calling on the black to stop.  But all was\nvain, for it was written otherwise.  The pursuer still ran, the chase\nstill sped before him screaming; they avoided the grave, and skimmed\nclose past the timbers of the wreck; in a breath they had cleared the\nsand; and still my kinsman did not pause, but dashed straight into the\nsurf; and the black, now almost within reach, still followed swiftly\nbehind him.  Rorie and I both stopped, for the thing was now beyond the\nhands of men, and these were the decrees of God that came to pass before\nour eyes.  There was never a sharper ending.  On that steep beach they\nwere beyond their depth at a bound; neither could swim; the black rose\nonce for a moment with a throttling cry; but the current had them, racing\nseaward; and if ever they came up again, which God alone can tell, it\nwould be ten minutes after, at the far end of Aros Roost, where the\nseabirds hover fishing.\n\n\n\n\nWILL O' THE MILL.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  THE PLAIN AND THE STARS.\n\n\nThe Mill here Will lived with his adopted parents stood in a falling\nvalley between pinewoods and great mountains.  Above, hill after hill,\nsoared upwards until they soared out of the depth of the hardiest timber,\nand stood naked against the sky.  Some way up, a long grey village lay\nlike a seam or a ray of vapour on a wooded hillside; and when the wind\nwas favourable, the sound of the church bells would drop down, thin and\nsilvery, to Will.  Below, the valley grew ever steeper and steeper, and\nat the same time widened out on either hand; and from an eminence beside\nthe mill it was possible to see its whole length and away beyond it over\na wide plain, where the river turned and shone, and moved on from city to\ncity on its voyage towards the sea.  It chanced that over this valley\nthere lay a pass into a neighbouring kingdom; so that, quiet and rural as\nit was, the road that ran along beside the river was a high thoroughfare\nbetween two splendid and powerful societies.  All through the summer,\ntravelling-carriages came crawling up, or went plunging briskly downwards\npast the mill; and as it happened that the other side was very much\neasier of ascent, the path was not much frequented, except by people\ngoing in one direction; and of all the carriages that Will saw go by,\nfive-sixths were plunging briskly downwards and only one-sixth crawling\nup.  Much more was this the case with foot-passengers.  All the light-\nfooted tourists, all the pedlars laden with strange wares, were tending\ndownward like the river that accompanied their path.  Nor was this all;\nfor when Will was yet a child a disastrous war arose over a great part of\nthe world.  The newspapers were full of defeats and victories, the earth\nrang with cavalry hoofs, and often for days together and for miles around\nthe coil of battle terrified good people from their labours in the field.\nOf all this, nothing was heard for a long time in the valley; but at last\none of the commanders pushed an army over the pass by forced marches, and\nfor three days horse and foot, cannon and tumbril, drum and standard,\nkept pouring downward past the mill.  All day the child stood and watched\nthem on their passage--the rhythmical stride, the pale, unshaven faces\ntanned about the eyes, the discoloured regimentals and the tattered\nflags, filled him with a sense of weariness, pity, and wonder; and all\nnight long, after he was in bed, he could hear the cannon pounding and\nthe feet trampling, and the great armament sweeping onward and downward\npast the mill.  No one in the valley ever heard the fate of the\nexpedition, for they lay out of the way of gossip in those troublous\ntimes; but Will saw one thing plainly, that not a man returned.  Whither\nhad they all gone?  Whither went all the tourists and pedlars with\nstrange wares? whither all the brisk barouches with servants in the\ndicky? whither the water of the stream, ever coursing downward and ever\nrenewed from above?  Even the wind blew oftener down the valley, and\ncarried the dead leaves along with it in the fall.  It seemed like a\ngreat conspiracy of things animate and inanimate; they all went downward,\nfleetly and gaily downward, and only he, it seemed, remained behind, like\na stock upon the wayside.  It sometimes made him glad when he noticed how\nthe fishes kept their heads up stream.  They, at least, stood faithfully\nby him, while all else were posting downward to the unknown world.\n\nOne evening he asked the miller where the river went.\n\n'It goes down the valley,' answered he, 'and turns a power of mills--six\nscore mills, they say, from here to Unterdeck--and is none the wearier\nafter all.  And then it goes out into the lowlands, and waters the great\ncorn country, and runs through a sight of fine cities (so they say) where\nkings live all alone in great palaces, with a sentry walling up and down\nbefore the door.  And it goes under bridges with stone men upon them,\nlooking down and smiling so curious it the water, and living folks\nleaning their elbows on the wall and looking over too.  And then it goes\non and on, and down through marshes and sands, until at last it falls\ninto the sea, where the ships are that bring parrots and tobacco from the\nIndies.  Ay, it has a long trot before it as it goes singing over our\nweir, bless its heart!'\n\n'And what is the sea?' asked Will.\n\n'The sea!' cried the miller.  'Lord help us all, it is the greatest thing\nGod made!  That is where all the water in the world runs down into a\ngreat salt lake.  There it lies, as flat as my hand and as innocent-like\nas a child; but they do say when the wind blows it gets up into water-\nmountains bigger than any of ours, and swallows down great ships bigger\nthan our mill, and makes such a roaring that you can hear it miles away\nupon the land.  There are great fish in it five times bigger than a bull,\nand one old serpent as long as our river and as old as all the world,\nwith whiskers like a man, and a crown of silver on her head.'\n\nWill thought he had never heard anything like this, and he kept on asking\nquestion after question about the world that lay away down the river,\nwith all its perils and marvels, until the old miller became quite\ninterested himself, and at last took him by the hand and led him to the\nhilltop that overlooks the valley and the plain.  The sun was near\nsetting, and hung low down in a cloudless sky.  Everything was defined\nand glorified in golden light.  Will had never seen so great an expanse\nof country in his life; he stood and gazed with all his eyes.  He could\nsee the cities, and the woods and fields, and the bright curves of the\nriver, and far away to where the rim of the plain trenched along the\nshining heavens.  An over-mastering emotion seized upon the boy, soul and\nbody; his heart beat so thickly that he could not breathe; the scene swam\nbefore his eyes; the sun seemed to wheel round and round, and throw off,\nas it turned, strange shapes which disappeared with the rapidity of\nthought, and were succeeded by others.  Will covered his face with his\nhands, and burst into a violent fit of tears; and the poor miller, sadly\ndisappointed and perplexed, saw nothing better for it than to take him up\nin his arms and carry him home in silence.\n\nFrom that day forward Will was full of new hopes and longings.  Something\nkept tugging at his heart-strings; the running water carried his desires\nalong with it as he dreamed over its fleeting surface; the wind, as it\nran over innumerable tree-tops, hailed him with encouraging words;\nbranches beckoned downward; the open road, as it shouldered round the\nangles and went turning and vanishing fast and faster down the valley,\ntortured him with its solicitations.  He spent long whiles on the\neminence, looking down the rivershed and abroad on the fat lowlands, and\nwatched the clouds that travelled forth upon the sluggish wind and\ntrailed their purple shadows on the plain; or he would linger by the\nwayside, and follow the carriages with his eyes as they rattled downward\nby the river.  It did not matter what it was; everything that went that\nway, were it cloud or carriage, bird or brown water in the stream, he\nfelt his heart flow out after it in an ecstasy of longing.\n\nWe are told by men of science that all the ventures of mariners on the\nsea, all that counter-marching of tribes and races that confounds old\nhistory with its dust and rumour, sprang from nothing more abstruse than\nthe laws of supply and demand, and a certain natural instinct for cheap\nrations.  To any one thinking deeply, this will seem a dull and pitiful\nexplanation.  The tribes that came swarming out of the North and East, if\nthey were indeed pressed onward from behind by others, were drawn at the\nsame time by the magnetic influence of the South and West.  The fame of\nother lands had reached them; the name of the eternal city rang in their\nears; they were not colonists, but pilgrims; they travelled towards wine\nand gold and sunshine, but their hearts were set on something higher.\nThat divine unrest, that old stinging trouble of humanity that makes all\nhigh achievements and all miserable failure, the same that spread wings\nwith Icarus, the same that sent Columbus into the desolate Atlantic,\ninspired and supported these barbarians on their perilous march.  There\nis one legend which profoundly represents their spirit, of how a flying\nparty of these wanderers encountered a very old man shod with iron.  The\nold man asked them whither they were going; and they answered with one\nvoice: 'To the Eternal City!'  He looked upon them gravely.  'I have\nsought it,' he said, 'over the most part of the world.  Three such pairs\nas I now carry on my feet have I worn out upon this pilgrimage, and now\nthe fourth is growing slender underneath my steps.  And all this while I\nhave not found the city.'  And he turned and went his own way alone,\nleaving them astonished.\n\nAnd yet this would scarcely parallel the intensity of Will's feeling for\nthe plain.  If he could only go far enough out there, he felt as if his\neyesight would be purged and clarified, as if his hearing would grow more\ndelicate, and his very breath would come and go with luxury.  He was\ntransplanted and withering where he was; he lay in a strange country and\nwas sick for home.  Bit by bit, he pieced together broken notions of the\nworld below: of the river, ever moving and growing until it sailed forth\ninto the majestic ocean; of the cities, full of brisk and beautiful\npeople, playing fountains, bands of music and marble palaces, and lighted\nup at night from end to end with artificial stars of gold; of the great\nchurches, wise universities, brave armies, and untold money lying stored\nin vaults; of the high-flying vice that moved in the sunshine, and the\nstealth and swiftness of midnight murder.  I have said he was sick as if\nfor home: the figure halts.  He was like some one lying in twilit,\nformless preexistence, and stretching out his hands lovingly towards many-\ncoloured, many-sounding life.  It was no wonder he was unhappy, he would\ngo and tell the fish: they were made for their life, wished for no more\nthan worms and running water, and a hole below a falling bank; but he was\ndifferently designed, full of desires and aspirations, itching at the\nfingers, lusting with the eyes, whom the whole variegated world could not\nsatisfy with aspects.  The true life, the true bright sunshine, lay far\nout upon the plain.  And O! to see this sunlight once before he died! to\nmove with a jocund spirit in a golden land! to hear the trained singers\nand sweet church bells, and see the holiday gardens!  'And O fish!' he\nwould cry, 'if you would only turn your noses down stream, you could swim\nso easily into the fabled waters and see the vast ships passing over your\nhead like clouds, and hear the great water-hills making music over you\nall day long!'  But the fish kept looking patiently in their own\ndirection, until Will hardly knew whether to laugh or cry.\n\nHitherto the traffic on the road had passed by Will, like something seen\nin a picture: he had perhaps exchanged salutations with a tourist, or\ncaught sight of an old gentleman in a travelling cap at a carriage\nwindow; but for the most part it had been a mere symbol, which he\ncontemplated from apart and with something of a superstitious feeling.  A\ntime came at last when this was to be changed.  The miller, who was a\ngreedy man in his way, and never forewent an opportunity of honest\nprofit, turned the mill-house into a little wayside inn, and, several\npieces of good fortune falling in opportunely, built stables and got the\nposition of post master on the road.  It now became Will's duty to wait\nupon people, as they sat to break their fasts in the little arbour at the\ntop of the mill garden; and you may be sure that he kept his ears open,\nand learned many new things about the outside world as he brought the\nomelette or the wine.  Nay, he would often get into conversation with\nsingle guests, and by adroit questions and polite attention, not only\ngratify his own curiosity, but win the goodwill of the travellers.  Many\ncomplimented the old couple on their serving-boy; and a professor was\neager to take him away with him, and have him properly educated in the\nplain.  The miller and his wife were mightily astonished and even more\npleased.  They thought it a very good thing that they should have opened\ntheir inn.  'You see,' the old man would remark, 'he has a kind of talent\nfor a publican; he never would have made anything else!'  And so life\nwagged on in the valley, with high satisfaction to all concerned but\nWill.  Every carriage that left the inn-door seemed to take a part of him\naway with it; and when people jestingly offered him a lift, he could with\ndifficulty command his emotion.  Night after night he would dream that he\nwas awakened by flustered servants, and that a splendid equipage waited\nat the door to carry him down into the plain; night after night; until\nthe dream, which had seemed all jollity to him at first, began to take on\na colour of gravity, and the nocturnal summons and waiting equipage\noccupied a place in his mind as something to be both feared and hoped\nfor.\n\nOne day, when Will was about sixteen, a fat young man arrived at sunset\nto pass the night.  He was a contented-looking fellow, with a jolly eye,\nand carried a knapsack.  While dinner was preparing, he sat in the arbour\nto read a book; but as soon as he had begun to observe Will, the book was\nlaid aside; he was plainly one of those who prefer living people to\npeople made of ink and paper.  Will, on his part, although he had not\nbeen much interested in the stranger at first sight, soon began to take a\ngreat deal of pleasure in his talk, which was full of good nature and\ngood sense, and at last conceived a great respect for his character and\nwisdom.  They sat far into the night; and about two in the morning Will\nopened his heart to the young man, and told him how he longed to leave\nthe valley and what bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the\nplain.  The young man whistled, and then broke into a smile.\n\n'My young friend,' he remarked, 'you are a very curious little fellow to\nbe sure, and wish a great many things which you will never get.  Why, you\nwould feel quite ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these\nfairy cities of yours are all after the same sort of nonsense, and keep\nbreaking their hearts to get up into the mountains.  And let me tell you,\nthose who go down into the plains are a very short while there before\nthey wish themselves heartily back again.  The air is not so light nor so\npure; nor is the sun any brighter.  As for the beautiful men and women,\nyou would see many of them in rags and many of them deformed with\nhorrible disorders; and a city is so hard a place for people who are poor\nand sensitive that many choose to die by their own hand.'\n\n'You must think me very simple,' answered Will.  'Although I have never\nbeen out of this valley, believe me, I have used my eyes.  I know how one\nthing lives on another; for instance, how the fish hangs in the eddy to\ncatch his fellows; and the shepherd, who makes so pretty a picture\ncarrying home the lamb, is only carrying it home for dinner.  I do not\nexpect to find all things right in your cities.  That is not what\ntroubles me; it might have been that once upon a time; but although I\nlive here always, I have asked many questions and learned a great deal in\nthese last years, and certainly enough to cure me of my old fancies.  But\nyou would not have me die like a dog and not see all that is to be seen,\nand do all that a man can do, let it be good or evil? you would not have\nme spend all my days between this road here and the river, and not so\nmuch as make a motion to be up and live my life?--I would rather die out\nof hand,' he cried, 'than linger on as I am doing.'\n\n'Thousands of people,' said the young man, 'live and die like you, and\nare none the less happy.'\n\n'Ah!' said Will, 'if there are thousands who would like, why should not\none of them have my place?'\n\nIt was quite dark; there was a hanging lamp in the arbour which lit up\nthe table and the faces of the speakers; and along the arch, the leaves\nupon the trellis stood out illuminated against the night sky, a pattern\nof transparent green upon a dusky purple.  The fat young man rose, and,\ntaking Will by the arm, led him out under the open heavens.\n\n'Did you ever look at the stars?' he asked, pointing upwards.\n\n'Often and often,' answered Will.\n\n'And do you know what they are?'\n\n'I have fancied many things.'\n\n'They are worlds like ours,' said the young man.  'Some of them less;\nmany of them a million times greater; and some of the least sparkles that\nyou see are not only worlds, but whole clusters of worlds turning about\neach other in the midst of space.  We do not know what there may be in\nany of them; perhaps the answer to all our difficulties or the cure of\nall our sufferings: and yet we can never reach them; not all the skill of\nthe craftiest of men can fit out a ship for the nearest of these our\nneighbours, nor would the life of the most aged suffice for such a\njourney.  When a great battle has been lost or a dear friend is dead,\nwhen we are hipped or in high spirits, there they are unweariedly shining\noverhead.  We may stand down here, a whole army of us together, and shout\nuntil we break our hearts, and not a whisper reaches them.  We may climb\nthe highest mountain, and we are no nearer them.  All we can do is to\nstand down here in the garden and take off our hats; the starshine lights\nupon our heads, and where mine is a little bald, I dare say you can see\nit glisten in the darkness.  The mountain and the mouse.  That is like to\nbe all we shall ever have to do with Arcturus or Aldebaran.  Can you\napply a parable?' he added, laying his hand upon Will's shoulder.  'It is\nnot the same thing as a reason, but usually vastly more convincing.'\n\nWill hung his head a little, and then raised it once more to heaven.  The\nstars seemed to expand and emit a sharper brilliancy; and as he kept\nturning his eyes higher and higher, they seemed to increase in multitude\nunder his gaze.\n\n'I see,' he said, turning to the young man.  'We are in a rat-trap.'\n\n'Something of that size.  Did you ever see a squirrel turning in a cage?\nand another squirrel sitting philosophically over his nuts?  I needn't\nask you which of them looked more of a fool.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  THE PARSON'S MARJORY.\n\n\nAfter some years the old people died, both in one winter, very carefully\ntended by their adopted son, and very quietly mourned when they were\ngone.  People who had heard of his roving fancies supposed he would\nhasten to sell the property, and go down the river to push his fortunes.\nBut there was never any sign of such in intention on the part of Will.  On\nthe contrary, he had the inn set on a better footing, and hired a couple\nof servants to assist him in carrying it on; and there he settled down, a\nkind, talkative, inscrutable young man, six feet three in his stockings,\nwith an iron constitution and a friendly voice.  He soon began to take\nrank in the district as a bit of an oddity: it was not much to be\nwondered at from the first, for he was always full of notions, and kept\ncalling the plainest common-sense in question; but what most raised the\nreport upon him was the odd circumstance of his courtship with the\nparson's Marjory.\n\nThe parson's Marjory was a lass about nineteen, when Will would be about\nthirty; well enough looking, and much better educated than any other girl\nin that part of the country, as became her parentage.  She held her head\nvery high, and had already refused several offers of marriage with a\ngrand air, which had got her hard names among the neighbours.  For all\nthat she was a good girl, and one that would have made any man well\ncontented.\n\nWill had never seen much of her; for although the church and parsonage\nwere only two miles from his own door, he was never known to go there but\non Sundays.  It chanced, however, that the parsonage fell into disrepair,\nand had to be dismantled; and the parson and his daughter took lodgings\nfor a month or so, on very much reduced terms, at Will's inn.  Now, what\nwith the inn, and the mill, and the old miller's savings, our friend was\na man of substance; and besides that, he had a name for good temper and\nshrewdness, which make a capital portion in marriage; and so it was\ncurrently gossiped, among their ill-wishers, that the parson and his\ndaughter had not chosen their temporary lodging with their eyes shut.\nWill was about the last man in the world to be cajoled or frightened into\nmarriage.  You had only to look into his eyes, limpid and still like\npools of water, and yet with a sort of clear light that seemed to come\nfrom within, and you would understand at once that here was one who knew\nhis own mind, and would stand to it immovably.  Marjory herself was no\nweakling by her looks, with strong, steady eyes and a resolute and quiet\nbearing.  It might be a question whether she was not Will's match in\nstedfastness, after all, or which of them would rule the roost in\nmarriage.  But Marjory had never given it a thought, and accompanied her\nfather with the most unshaken innocence and unconcern.\n\nThe season was still so early that Will's customers were few and far\nbetween; but the lilacs were already flowering, and the weather was so\nmild that the party took dinner under the trellice, with the noise of the\nriver in their ears and the woods ringing about them with the songs of\nbirds.  Will soon began to take a particular pleasure in these dinners.\nThe parson was rather a dull companion, with a habit of dozing at table;\nbut nothing rude or cruel ever fell from his lips.  And as for the\nparson's daughter, she suited her surroundings with the best grace\nimaginable; and whatever she said seemed so pat and pretty that Will\nconceived a great idea of her talents.  He could see her face, as she\nleaned forward, against a background of rising pinewoods; her eyes shone\npeaceably; the light lay around her hair like a kerchief; something that\nwas hardly a smile rippled her pale cheeks, and Will could not contain\nhimself from gazing on her in an agreeable dismay.  She looked, even in\nher quietest moments, so complete in herself, and so quick with life down\nto her finger tips and the very skirts of her dress, that the remainder\nof created things became no more than a blot by comparison; and if Will\nglanced away from her to her surroundings, the trees looked inanimate and\nsenseless, the clouds hung in heaven like dead things, and even the\nmountain tops were disenchanted.  The whole valley could not compare in\nlooks with this one girl.\n\nWill was always observant in the society of his fellow-creatures; but his\nobservation became almost painfully eager in the case of Marjory.  He\nlistened to all she uttered, and read her eyes, at the same time, for the\nunspoken commentary.  Many kind, simple, and sincere speeches found an\necho in his heart.  He became conscious of a soul beautifully poised upon\nitself, nothing doubting, nothing desiring, clothed in peace.  It was not\npossible to separate her thoughts from her appearance.  The turn of her\nwrist, the still sound of her voice, the light in her eyes, the lines of\nher body, fell in tune with her grave and gentle words, like the\naccompaniment that sustains and harmonises the voice of the singer.  Her\ninfluence was one thing, not to be divided or discussed, only to be felt\nwith gratitude and joy.  To Will, her presence recalled something of his\nchildhood, and the thought of her took its place in his mind beside that\nof dawn, of running water, and of the earliest violets and lilacs.  It is\nthe property of things seen for the first time, or for the first time\nafter long, like the flowers in spring, to reawaken in us the sharp edge\nof sense and that impression of mystic strangeness which otherwise passes\nout of life with the coming of years; but the sight of a loved face is\nwhat renews a man's character from the fountain upwards.\n\nOne day after dinner Will took a stroll among the firs; a grave beatitude\npossessed him from top to toe, and he kept smiling to himself and the\nlandscape as he went.  The river ran between the stepping-stones with a\npretty wimple; a bird sang loudly in the wood; the hill-tops looked\nimmeasurably high, and as he glanced at them from time to time seemed to\ncontemplate his movements with a beneficent but awful curiosity.  His way\ntook him to the eminence which overlooked the plain; and there he sat\ndown upon a stone, and fell into deep and pleasant thought.  The plain\nlay abroad with its cities and silver river; everything was asleep,\nexcept a great eddy of birds which kept rising and falling and going\nround and round in the blue air.  He repeated Marjory's name aloud, and\nthe sound of it gratified his ear.  He shut his eyes, and her image\nsprang up before him, quietly luminous and attended with good thoughts.\nThe river might run for ever; the birds fly higher and higher till they\ntouched the stars.  He saw it was empty bustle after all; for here,\nwithout stirring a feet, waiting patiently in his own narrow valley, he\nalso had attained the better sunlight.\n\nThe next day Will made a sort of declaration across the dinner-table,\nwhile the parson was filling his pipe.\n\n'Miss Marjory,' he said, 'I never knew any one I liked so well as you.  I\nam mostly a cold, unkindly sort of man; not from want of heart, but out\nof strangeness in my way of thinking; and people seem far away from me.\n'Tis as if there were a circle round me, which kept every one out but\nyou; I can hear the others talking and laughing; but you come quite\nclose.  Maybe, this is disagreeable to you?' he asked.\n\nMarjory made no answer.\n\n'Speak up, girl,' said the parson.\n\n'Nay, now,' returned Will, 'I wouldn't press her, parson.  I feel tongue-\ntied myself, who am not used to it; and she's a woman, and little more\nthan a child, when all is said.  But for my part, as far as I can\nunderstand what people mean by it, I fancy I must be what they call in\nlove.  I do not wish to be held as committing myself; for I may be wrong;\nbut that is how I believe things are with me.  And if Miss Marjory should\nfeel any otherwise on her part, mayhap she would be so kind as shake her\nhead.'\n\nMarjory was silent, and gave no sign that she had heard.\n\n'How is that, parson?' asked Will.\n\n'The girl must speak,' replied the parson, laying down his pipe.  'Here's\nour neighbour who says he loves you, Madge.  Do you love him, ay or no?'\n\n'I think I do,' said Marjory, faintly.\n\n'Well then, that's all that could be wished!' cried Will, heartily.  And\nhe took her hand across the table, and held it a moment in both of his\nwith great satisfaction.\n\n'You must marry,' observed the parson, replacing his pipe in his mouth.\n\n'Is that the right thing to do, think you?' demanded Will.\n\n'It is indispensable,' said the parson.\n\n'Very well,' replied the wooer.\n\nTwo or three days passed away with great delight to Will, although a\nbystander might scarce have found it out.  He continued to take his meals\nopposite Marjory, and to talk with her and gaze upon her in her father's\npresence; but he made no attempt to see her alone, nor in any other way\nchanged his conduct towards her from what it had been since the\nbeginning.  Perhaps the girl was a little disappointed, and perhaps not\nunjustly; and yet if it had been enough to be always in the thoughts of\nanother person, and so pervade and alter his whole life, she might have\nbeen thoroughly contented.  For she was never out of Will's mind for an\ninstant.  He sat over the stream, and watched the dust of the eddy, and\nthe poised fish, and straining weeds; he wandered out alone into the\npurple even, with all the blackbirds piping round him in the wood; he\nrose early in the morning, and saw the sky turn from grey to gold, and\nthe light leap upon the hill-tops; and all the while he kept wondering if\nhe had never seen such things before, or how it was that they should look\nso different now.  The sound of his own mill-wheel, or of the wind among\nthe trees, confounded and charmed his heart.  The most enchanting\nthoughts presented themselves unbidden in his mind.  He was so happy that\nhe could not sleep at night, and so restless, that he could hardly sit\nstill out of her company.  And yet it seemed as if he avoided her rather\nthan sought her out.\n\nOne day, as he was coming home from a ramble, Will found Marjory in the\ngarden picking flowers, and as he came up with her, slackened his pace\nand continued walking by her side.\n\n'You like flowers?' he said.\n\n'Indeed I love them dearly,' she replied.  'Do you?'\n\n'Why, no,' said he, 'not so much.  They are a very small affair, when all\nis done.  I can fancy people caring for them greatly, but not doing as\nyou are just now.'\n\n'How?' she asked, pausing and looking up at him.\n\n'Plucking them,' said he.  'They are a deal better off where they are,\nand look a deal prettier, if you go to that.'\n\n'I wish to have them for my own,' she answered, 'to carry them near my\nheart, and keep them in my room.  They tempt me when they grow here; they\nseem to say, \"Come and do something with us;\" but once I have cut them\nand put them by, the charm is laid, and I can look at them with quite an\neasy heart.'\n\n'You wish to possess them,' replied Will, 'in order to think no more\nabout them.  It's a bit like killing the goose with the golden eggs.  It's\na bit like what I wished to do when I was a boy.  Because I had a fancy\nfor looking out over the plain, I wished to go down there--where I\ncouldn't look out over it any longer.  Was not that fine reasoning?  Dear,\ndear, if they only thought of it, all the world would do like me; and you\nwould let your flowers alone, just as I stay up here in the mountains.'\nSuddenly he broke off sharp.  'By the Lord!' he cried.  And when she\nasked him what was wrong, he turned the question off and walked away into\nthe house with rather a humorous expression of face.\n\nHe was silent at table; and after the night hid fallen and the stars had\ncome out overhead, he walked up and down for hours in the courtyard and\ngarden with an uneven pace.  There was still a light in the window of\nMarjory's room: one little oblong patch of orange in a world of dark blue\nhills and silver starlight.  Will's mind ran a great deal on the window;\nbut his thoughts were not very lover-like.  'There she is in her room,'\nhe thought, 'and there are the stars overhead:--a blessing upon both!'\nBoth were good influences in his life; both soothed and braced him in his\nprofound contentment with the world.  And what more should he desire with\neither?  The fat young man and his councils were so present to his mind,\nthat he threw back his head, and, putting his hands before his mouth,\nshouted aloud to the populous heavens.  Whether from the position of his\nhead or the sudden strain of the exertion, he seemed to see a momentary\nshock among the stars, and a diffusion of frosty light pass from one to\nanother along the sky.  At the same instant, a corner of the blind was\nlifted and lowered again at once.  He laughed a loud ho-ho!  'One and\nanother!' thought Will.  'The stars tremble, and the blind goes up.  Why,\nbefore Heaven, what a great magician I must be!  Now if I were only a\nfool, should not I be in a pretty way?'  And he went off to bed,\nchuckling to himself: 'If I were only a fool!'\n\nThe next morning, pretty early, he saw her once more in the garden, and\nsought her out.\n\n'I have been thinking about getting married,' he began abruptly; 'and\nafter having turned it all over, I have made up my mind it's not\nworthwhile.'\n\nShe turned upon him for a single moment; but his radiant, kindly\nappearance would, under the circumstances, have disconcerted an angel,\nand she looked down again upon the ground in silence.  He could see her\ntremble.\n\n'I hope you don't mind,' he went on, a little taken aback.  'You ought\nnot.  I have turned it all over, and upon my soul there's nothing in it.\nWe should never be one whit nearer than we are just now, and, if I am a\nwise man, nothing like so happy.'\n\n'It is unnecessary to go round about with me,' she said.  'I very well\nremember that you refused to commit yourself; and now that I see you were\nmistaken, and in reality have never cared for me, I can only feel sad\nthat I have been so far misled.'\n\n'I ask your pardon,' said Will stoutly; 'you do not understand my\nmeaning.  As to whether I have ever loved you or not, I must leave that\nto others.  But for one thing, my feeling is not changed; and for\nanother, you may make it your boast that you have made my whole life and\ncharacter something different from what they were.  I mean what I say; no\nless.  I do not think getting married is worth while.  I would rather you\nwent on living with your father, so that I could walk over and see you\nonce, or maybe twice a week, as people go to church, and then we should\nboth be all the happier between whiles.  That's my notion.  But I'll\nmarry you if you will,' he added.\n\n'Do you know that you are insulting me?' she broke out.\n\n'Not I, Marjory,' said he; 'if there is anything in a clear conscience,\nnot I.  I offer all my heart's best affection; you can take it or want\nit, though I suspect it's beyond either your power or mine to change what\nhas once been done, and set me fancy-free.  I'll marry you, if you like;\nbut I tell you again and again, it's not worth while, and we had best\nstay friends.  Though I am a quiet man I have noticed a heap of things in\nmy life.  Trust in me, and take things as I propose; or, if you don't\nlike that, say the word, and I'll marry you out of hand.'\n\nThere was a considerable pause, and Will, who began to feel uneasy, began\nto grow angry in consequence.\n\n'It seems you are too proud to say your mind,' he said.  'Believe me\nthat's a pity.  A clean shrift makes simple living.  Can a man be more\ndownright or honourable, to a woman than I have been?  I have said my\nsay, and given you your choice.  Do you want me to marry you? or will you\ntake my friendship, as I think best? or have you had enough of me for\ngood?  Speak out for the dear God's sake!  You know your father told you\na girl should speak her mind in these affairs.'\n\nShe seemed to recover herself at that, turned without a word, walked\nrapidly through the garden, and disappeared into the house, leaving Will\nin some confusion as to the result.  He walked up and down the garden,\nwhistling softly to himself.  Sometimes he stopped and contemplated the\nsky and hill-tops; sometimes he went down to the tail of the weir and sat\nthere, looking foolishly in the water.  All this dubiety and perturbation\nwas so foreign to his nature and the life which he had resolutely chosen\nfor himself, that he began to regret Marjory's arrival.  'After all,' he\nthought, 'I was as happy as a man need be.  I could come down here and\nwatch my fishes all day long if I wanted: I was as settled and contented\nas my old mill.'\n\nMarjory came down to dinner, looking very trim and quiet; and no sooner\nwere all three at table than she made her father a speech, with her eyes\nfixed upon her plate, but showing no other sign of embarrassment or\ndistress.\n\n'Father,' she began, 'Mr. Will and I have been talking things over.  We\nsee that we have each made a mistake about our feelings, and he has\nagreed, at my request, to give up all idea of marriage, and be no more\nthan my very good friend, as in the past.  You see, there is no shadow of\na quarrel, and indeed I hope we shall see a great deal of him in the\nfuture, for his visits will always be welcome in our house.  Of course,\nfather, you will know best, but perhaps we should do better to leave Mr.\nWill's house for the present.  I believe, after what has passed, we\nshould hardly be agreeable inmates for some days.'\n\nWill, who had commanded himself with difficulty from the first, broke out\nupon this into an inarticulate noise, and raised one hand with an\nappearance of real dismay, as if he were about to interfere and\ncontradict.  But she checked him at once looking up at him with a swift\nglance and an angry flush upon her cheek.\n\n'You will perhaps have the good grace,' she said, 'to let me explain\nthese matters for myself.'\n\nWill was put entirely out of countenance by her expression and the ring\nof her voice.  He held his peace, concluding that there were some things\nabout this girl beyond his comprehension, in which he was exactly right.\n\nThe poor parson was quite crestfallen.  He tried to prove that this was\nno more than a true lovers' tiff, which would pass off before night; and\nwhen he was dislodged from that position, he went on to argue that where\nthere was no quarrel there could be no call for a separation; for the\ngood man liked both his entertainment and his host.  It was curious to\nsee how the girl managed them, saying little all the time, and that very\nquietly, and yet twisting them round her finger and insensibly leading\nthem wherever she would by feminine tact and generalship.  It scarcely\nseemed to have been her doing--it seemed as if things had merely so\nfallen out--that she and her father took their departure that same\nafternoon in a farm-cart, and went farther down the valley, to wait,\nuntil their own house was ready for them, in another hamlet.  But Will\nhad been observing closely, and was well aware of her dexterity and\nresolution.  When he found himself alone he had a great many curious\nmatters to turn over in his mind.  He was very sad and solitary, to begin\nwith.  All the interest had gone out of his life, and he might look up at\nthe stars as long as he pleased, he somehow failed to find support or\nconsolation.  And then he was in such a turmoil of spirit about Marjory.\nHe had been puzzled and irritated at her behaviour, and yet he could not\nkeep himself from admiring it.  He thought he recognised a fine, perverse\nangel in that still soul which he had never hitherto suspected; and\nthough he saw it was an influence that would fit but ill with his own\nlife of artificial calm, he could not keep himself from ardently desiring\nto possess it.  Like a man who has lived among shadows and now meets the\nsun, he was both pained and delighted.\n\nAs the days went forward he passed from one extreme to another; now\npluming himself on the strength of his determination, now despising his\ntimid and silly caution.  The former was, perhaps, the true thought of\nhis heart, and represented the regular tenor of the man's reflections;\nbut the latter burst forth from time to time with an unruly violence, and\nthen he would forget all consideration, and go up and down his house and\ngarden or walk among the fir-woods like one who is beside himself with\nremorse.  To equable, steady-minded Will this state of matters was\nintolerable; and he determined, at whatever cost, to bring it to an end.\nSo, one warm summer afternoon he put on his best clothes, took a thorn\nswitch in his hand, and set out down the valley by the river.  As soon as\nhe had taken his determination, he had regained at a bound his customary\npeace of heart, and he enjoyed the bright weather and the variety of the\nscene without any admixture of alarm or unpleasant eagerness.  It was\nnearly the same to him how the matter turned out.  If she accepted him he\nwould have to marry her this time, which perhaps was, all for the best.\nIf she refused him, he would have done his utmost, and might follow his\nown way in the future with an untroubled conscience.  He hoped, on the\nwhole, she would refuse him; and then, again, as he saw the brown roof\nwhich sheltered her, peeping through some willows at an angle of the\nstream, he was half inclined to reverse the wish, and more than half\nashamed of himself for this infirmity of purpose.\n\nMarjory seemed glad to see him, and gave him her hand without affectation\nor delay.\n\n'I have been thinking about this marriage,' he began.\n\n'So have I,' she answered.  'And I respect you more and more for a very\nwise man.  You understood me better than I understood myself; and I am\nnow quite certain that things are all for the best as they are.'\n\n'At the same time--,' ventured Will.\n\n'You must be tired,' she interrupted.  'Take a seat and let me fetch you\na glass of wine.  The afternoon is so warm; and I wish you not to be\ndispleased with your visit.  You must come quite often; once a week, if\nyou can spare the time; I am always so glad to see my friends.'\n\n'O, very well,' thought Will to himself.  'It appears I was right after\nall.'  And he paid a very agreeable visit, walked home again in capital\nspirits, and gave himself no further concern about the matter.\n\nFor nearly three years Will and Marjory continued on these terms, seeing\neach other once or twice a week without any word of love between them;\nand for all that time I believe Will was nearly as happy as a man can be.\nHe rather stinted himself the pleasure of seeing her; and he would often\nwalk half-way over to the parsonage, and then back again, as if to whet\nhis appetite.  Indeed there was one corner of the road, whence he could\nsee the church-spire wedged into a crevice of the valley between sloping\nfirwoods, with a triangular snatch of plain by way of background, which\nhe greatly affected as a place to sit and moralise in before returning\nhomewards; and the peasants got so much into the habit of finding him\nthere in the twilight that they gave it the name of 'Will o' the Mill's\nCorner.'\n\nAt the end of the three years Marjory played him a sad trick by suddenly\nmarrying somebody else.  Will kept his countenance bravely, and merely\nremarked that, for as little as he knew of women, he had acted very\nprudently in not marrying her himself three years before.  She plainly\nknew very little of her own mind, and, in spite of a deceptive manner,\nwas as fickle and flighty as the rest of them.  He had to congratulate\nhimself on an escape, he said, and would take a higher opinion of his own\nwisdom in consequence.  But at heart, he was reasonably displeased, moped\na good deal for a month or two, and fell away in flesh, to the\nastonishment of his serving-lads.\n\nIt was perhaps a year after this marriage that Will was awakened late one\nnight by the sound of a horse galloping on the road, followed by\nprecipitate knocking at the inn-door.  He opened his window and saw a\nfarm servant, mounted and holding a led horse by the bridle, who told him\nto make what haste he could and go along with him; for Marjory was dying,\nand had sent urgently to fetch him to her bedside.  Will was no horseman,\nand made so little speed upon the way that the poor young wife was very\nnear her end before he arrived.  But they had some minutes' talk in\nprivate, and he was present and wept very bitterly while she breathed her\nlast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  DEATH\n\n\nYear after year went away into nothing, with great explosions and\noutcries in the cities on the plain: red revolt springing up and being\nsuppressed in blood, battle swaying hither and thither, patient\nastronomers in observatory towers picking out and christening new stars,\nplays being performed in lighted theatres, people being carried into\nhospital on stretchers, and all the usual turmoil and agitation of men's\nlives in crowded centres.  Up in Will's valley only the winds and seasons\nmade an epoch; the fish hung in the swift stream, the birds circled\noverhead, the pine-tops rustled underneath the stars, the tall hills\nstood over all; and Will went to and fro, minding his wayside inn, until\nthe snow began to thicken on his head.  His heart was young and vigorous;\nand if his pulses kept a sober time, they still beat strong and steady in\nhis wrists.  He carried a ruddy stain on either cheek, like a ripe apple;\nhe stooped a little, but his step was still firm; and his sinewy hands\nwere reached out to all men with a friendly pressure.  His face was\ncovered with those wrinkles which are got in open air, and which rightly\nlooked at, are no more than a sort of permanent sunburning; such wrinkles\nheighten the stupidity of stupid faces; but to a person like Will, with\nhis clear eyes and smiling mouth, only give another charm by testifying\nto a simple and easy life.  His talk was full of wise sayings.  He had a\ntaste for other people; and other people had a taste for him.  When the\nvalley was full of tourists in the season, there were merry nights in\nWill's arbour; and his views, which seemed whimsical to his neighbours,\nwere often enough admired by learned people out of towns and colleges.\nIndeed, he had a very noble old age, and grew daily better known; so that\nhis fame was heard of in the cities of the plain; and young men who had\nbeen summer travellers spoke together in _cafes_ of Will o' the Mill and\nhis rough philosophy.  Many and many an invitation, you may be sure, he\nhad; but nothing could tempt him from his upland valley.  He would shake\nhis head and smile over his tobacco-pipe with a deal of meaning.  'You\ncome too late,' he would answer.  'I am a dead man now: I have lived and\ndied already.  Fifty years ago you would have brought my heart into my\nmouth; and now you do not even tempt me.  But that is the object of long\nliving, that man should cease to care about life.'  And again: 'There is\nonly one difference between a long life and a good dinner: that, in the\ndinner, the sweets come last.'  Or once more: 'When I was a boy, I was a\nbit puzzled, and hardly knew whether it was myself or the world that was\ncurious and worth looking into.  Now, I know it is myself, and stick to\nthat.'\n\nHe never showed any symptom of frailty, but kept stalwart and firm to the\nlast; but they say he grew less talkative towards the end, and would\nlisten to other people by the hour in an amused and sympathetic silence.\nOnly, when he did speak, it was more to the point and more charged with\nold experience.  He drank a bottle of wine gladly; above all, at sunset\non the hill-top or quite late at night under the stars in the arbour.  The\nsight of something attractive and unatttainable seasoned his enjoyment,\nhe would say; and he professed he had lived long enough to admire a\ncandle all the more when he could compare it with a planet.\n\nOne night, in his seventy-second year, he awoke in bed in such uneasiness\nof body and mind that he arose and dressed himself and went out to\nmeditate in the arbour.  It was pitch dark, without a star; the river was\nswollen, and the wet woods and meadows loaded the air with perfume.  It\nhad thundered during the day, and it promised more thunder for the\nmorrow.  A murky, stifling night for a man of seventy-two!  Whether it\nwas the weather or the wakefulness, or some little touch of fever in his\nold limbs, Will's mind was besieged by tumultuous and crying memories.\nHis boyhood, the night with the fat young man, the death of his adopted\nparents, the summer days with Marjory, and many of those small\ncircumstances, which seem nothing to another, and are yet the very gist\nof a man's own life to himself--things seen, words heard, looks\nmisconstrued--arose from their forgotten corners and usurped his\nattention.  The dead themselves were with him, not merely taking part in\nthis thin show of memory that defiled before his brain, but revisiting\nhis bodily senses as they do in profound and vivid dreams.  The fat young\nman leaned his elbows on the table opposite; Marjory came and went with\nan apronful of flowers between the garden and the arbour; he could hear\nthe old parson knocking out his pipe or blowing his resonant nose.  The\ntide of his consciousness ebbed and flowed: he was sometimes half-asleep\nand drowned in his recollections of the past; and sometimes he was broad\nawake, wondering at himself.  But about the middle of the night he was\nstartled by the voice of the dead miller calling to him out of the house\nas he used to do on the arrival of custom.  The hallucination was so\nperfect that Will sprang from his seat and stood listening for the\nsummons to be repeated; and as he listened he became conscious of another\nnoise besides the brawling of the river and the ringing in his feverish\nears.  It was like the stir of horses and the creaking of harness, as\nthough a carriage with an impatient team had been brought up upon the\nroad before the courtyard gate.  At such an hour, upon this rough and\ndangerous pass, the supposition was no better than absurd; and Will\ndismissed it from his mind, and resumed his seat upon the arbour chair;\nand sleep closed over him again like running water.  He was once again\nawakened by the dead miller's call, thinner and more spectral than\nbefore; and once again he heard the noise of an equipage upon the road.\nAnd so thrice and four times, the same dream, or the same fancy,\npresented itself to his senses: until at length, smiling to himself as\nwhen one humours a nervous child, he proceeded towards the gate to set\nhis uncertainty at rest.\n\nFrom the arbour to the gate was no great distance, and yet it took Will\nsome time; it seemed as if the dead thickened around him in the court,\nand crossed his path at every step.  For, first, he was suddenly\nsurprised by an overpowering sweetness of heliotropes; it was as if his\ngarden had been planted with this flower from end to end, and the hot,\ndamp night had drawn forth all their perfumes in a breath.  Now the\nheliotrope had been Marjory's favourite flower, and since her death not\none of them had ever been planted in Will's ground.\n\n'I must be going crazy,' he thought.  'Poor Marjory and her heliotropes!'\n\nAnd with that he raised his eyes towards the window that had once been\nhers.  If he had been bewildered before, he was now almost terrified; for\nthere was a light in the room; the window was an orange oblong as of\nyore; and the corner of the blind was lifted and let fall as on the night\nwhen he stood and shouted to the stars in his perplexity.  The illusion\nonly endured an instant; but it left him somewhat unmanned, rubbing his\neyes and staring at the outline of the house and the black night behind\nit.  While he thus stood, and it seemed as if he must have stood there\nquite a long time, there came a renewal of the noises on the road: and he\nturned in time to meet a stranger, who was advancing to meet him across\nthe court.  There was something like the outline of a great carriage\ndiscernible on the road behind the stranger, and, above that, a few black\npine-tops, like so many plumes.\n\n'Master Will?' asked the new-comer, in brief military fashion.\n\n'That same, sir,' answered Will.  'Can I do anything to serve you?'\n\n'I have heard you much spoken of, Master Will,' returned the other; 'much\nspoken of, and well.  And though I have both hands full of business, I\nwish to drink a bottle of wine with you in your arbour.  Before I go, I\nshall introduce myself.'\n\nWill led the way to the trellis, and got a lamp lighted and a bottle\nuncorked.  He was not altogether unused to such complimentary interviews,\nand hoped little enough from this one, being schooled by many\ndisappointments.  A sort of cloud had settled on his wits and prevented\nhim from remembering the strangeness of the hour.  He moved like a person\nin his sleep; and it seemed as if the lamp caught fire and the bottle\ncame uncorked with the facility of thought.  Still, he had some curiosity\nabout the appearance of his visitor, and tried in vain to turn the light\ninto his face; either he handled the lamp clumsily, or there was a\ndimness over his eyes; but he could make out little more than a shadow at\ntable with him.  He stared and stared at this shadow, as he wiped out the\nglasses, and began to feel cold and strange about the heart.  The silence\nweighed upon him, for he could hear nothing now, not even the river, but\nthe drumming of his own arteries in his ears.\n\n'Here's to you,' said the stranger, roughly.\n\n'Here is my service, sir,' replied Will, sipping his wine, which somehow\ntasted oddly.\n\n'I understand you are a very positive fellow,' pursued the stranger.\n\nWill made answer with a smile of some satisfaction and a little nod.\n\n'So am I,' continued the other; 'and it is the delight of my heart to\ntramp on people's corns.  I will have nobody positive but myself; not\none.  I have crossed the whims, in my time, of kings and generals and\ngreat artists.  And what would you say,' he went on, 'if I had come up\nhere on purpose to cross yours?'\n\nWill had it on his tongue to make a sharp rejoinder; but the politeness\nof an old innkeeper prevailed; and he held his peace and made answer with\na civil gesture of the hand.\n\n'I have,' said the stranger.  'And if I did not hold you in a particular\nesteem, I should make no words about the matter.  It appears you pride\nyourself on staying where you are.  You mean to stick by your inn.  Now I\nmean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche; and before this\nbottle's empty, so you shall.'\n\n'That would be an odd thing, to be sure,' replied Will, with a chuckle.\n'Why, sir, I have grown here like an old oak-tree; the Devil himself\ncould hardly root me up: and for all I perceive you are a very\nentertaining old gentleman, I would wager you another bottle you lose\nyour pains with me.'\n\nThe dimness of Will's eyesight had been increasing all this while; but he\nwas somehow conscious of a sharp and chilling scrutiny which irritated\nand yet overmastered him.\n\n'You need not think,' he broke out suddenly, in an explosive, febrile\nmanner that startled and alarmed himself, 'that I am a stay-at-home,\nbecause I fear anything under God.  God knows I am tired enough of it\nall; and when the time comes for a longer journey than ever you dream of,\nI reckon I shall find myself prepared.'\n\nThe stranger emptied his glass and pushed it away from him.  He looked\ndown for a little, and then, leaning over the table, tapped Will three\ntimes upon the forearm with a single finger.  'The time has come!' he\nsaid solemnly.\n\nAn ugly thrill spread from the spot he touched.  The tones of his voice\nwere dull and startling, and echoed strangely in Will's heart.\n\n'I beg your pardon,' he said, with some discomposure.  'What do you\nmean?'\n\n'Look at me, and you will find your eyesight swim.  Raise your hand; it\nis dead-heavy.  This is your last bottle of wine, Master Will, and your\nlast night upon the earth.'\n\n'You are a doctor?' quavered Will.\n\n'The best that ever was,' replied the other; 'for I cure both mind and\nbody with the same prescription.  I take away all pain and I forgive all\nsins; and where my patients have gone wrong in life, I smooth out all\ncomplications and set them free again upon their feet.'\n\n'I have no need of you,' said Will.\n\n'A time comes for all men, Master Will,' replied the doctor, 'when the\nhelm is taken out of their hands.  For you, because you were prudent and\nquiet, it has been long of coming, and you have had long to discipline\nyourself for its reception.  You have seen what is to be seen about your\nmill; you have sat close all your days like a hare in its form; but now\nthat is at an end; and,' added the doctor, getting on his feet, 'you must\narise and come with me.'\n\n'You are a strange physician,' said Will, looking steadfastly upon his\nguest.\n\n'I am a natural law,' he replied, 'and people call me Death.'\n\n'Why did you not tell me so at first?' cried Will.  'I have been waiting\nfor you these many years.  Give me your hand, and welcome.'\n\n'Lean upon my arm,' said the stranger, 'for already your strength abates.\nLean on me as heavily as you need; for though I am old, I am very strong.\nIt is but three steps to my carriage, and there all your trouble ends.\nWhy, Will,' he added, 'I have been yearning for you as if you were my own\nson; and of all the men that ever I came for in my long days, I have come\nfor you most gladly.  I am caustic, and sometimes offend people at first\nsight; but I am a good friend at heart to such as you.'\n\n'Since Marjory was taken,' returned Will, 'I declare before God you were\nthe only friend I had to look for.'  So the pair went arm-in-arm across\nthe courtyard.\n\nOne of the servants awoke about this time and heard the noise of horses\npawing before he dropped asleep again; all down the valley that night\nthere was a rushing as of a smooth and steady wind descending towards the\nplain; and when the world rose next morning, sure enough Will o' the Mill\nhad gone at last upon his travels.\n\n\n\n\nMARKHEIM\n\n\n'Yes,' said the dealer, 'our windfalls are of various kinds.  Some\ncustomers are ignorant, and then I touch a dividend on my superior\nknowledge.  Some are dishonest,' and here he held up the candle, so that\nthe light fell strongly on his visitor, 'and in that case,' he continued,\n'I profit by my virtue.'\n\nMarkheim had but just entered from the daylight streets, and his eyes had\nnot yet grown familiar with the mingled shine and darkness in the shop.\nAt these pointed words, and before the near presence of the flame, he\nblinked painfully and looked aside.\n\nThe dealer chuckled.  'You come to me on Christmas Day,' he resumed,\n'when you know that I am alone in my house, put up my shutters, and make\na point of refusing business.  Well, you will have to pay for that; you\nwill have to pay for my loss of time, when I should be balancing my\nbooks; you will have to pay, besides, for a kind of manner that I remark\nin you to-day very strongly.  I am the essence of discretion, and ask no\nawkward questions; but when a customer cannot look me in the eye, he has\nto pay for it.'  The dealer once more chuckled; and then, changing to his\nusual business voice, though still with a note of irony, 'You can give,\nas usual, a clear account of how you came into the possession of the\nobject?' he continued.  'Still your uncle's cabinet?  A remarkable\ncollector, sir!'\n\nAnd the little pale, round-shouldered dealer stood almost on tip-toe,\nlooking over the top of his gold spectacles, and nodding his head with\nevery mark of disbelief.  Markheim returned his gaze with one of infinite\npity, and a touch of horror.\n\n'This time,' said he, 'you are in error.  I have not come to sell, but to\nbuy.  I have no curios to dispose of; my uncle's cabinet is bare to the\nwainscot; even were it still intact, I have done well on the Stock\nExchange, and should more likely add to it than otherwise, and my errand\nto-day is simplicity itself.  I seek a Christmas present for a lady,' he\ncontinued, waxing more fluent as he struck into the speech he had\nprepared; 'and certainly I owe you every excuse for thus disturbing you\nupon so small a matter.  But the thing was neglected yesterday; I must\nproduce my little compliment at dinner; and, as you very well know, a\nrich marriage is not a thing to be neglected.'\n\nThere followed a pause, during which the dealer seemed to weigh this\nstatement incredulously.  The ticking of many clocks among the curious\nlumber of the shop, and the faint rushing of the cabs in a near\nthoroughfare, filled up the interval of silence.\n\n'Well, sir,' said the dealer, 'be it so.  You are an old customer after\nall; and if, as you say, you have the chance of a good marriage, far be\nit from me to be an obstacle.  Here is a nice thing for a lady now,' he\nwent on, 'this hand glass--fifteenth century, warranted; comes from a\ngood collection, too; but I reserve the name, in the interests of my\ncustomer, who was just like yourself, my dear sir, the nephew and sole\nheir of a remarkable collector.'\n\nThe dealer, while he thus ran on in his dry and biting voice, had stooped\nto take the object from its place; and, as he had done so, a shock had\npassed through Markheim, a start both of hand and foot, a sudden leap of\nmany tumultuous passions to the face.  It passed as swiftly as it came,\nand left no trace beyond a certain trembling of the hand that now\nreceived the glass.\n\n'A glass,' he said hoarsely, and then paused, and repeated it more\nclearly.  'A glass?  For Christmas?  Surely not?'\n\n'And why not?' cried the dealer.  'Why not a glass?'\n\nMarkheim was looking upon him with an indefinable expression.  'You ask\nme why not?' he said.  'Why, look here--look in it--look at yourself!  Do\nyou like to see it?  No! nor I--nor any man.'\n\nThe little man had jumped back when Markheim had so suddenly confronted\nhim with the mirror; but now, perceiving there was nothing worse on hand,\nhe chuckled.  'Your future lady, sir, must be pretty hard favoured,' said\nhe.\n\n'I ask you,' said Markheim, 'for a Christmas present, and you give me\nthis--this damned reminder of years, and sins and follies--this\nhand-conscience!  Did you mean it?  Had you a thought in your mind?  Tell\nme.  It will be better for you if you do.  Come, tell me about yourself.\nI hazard a guess now, that you are in secret a very charitable man?'\n\nThe dealer looked closely at his companion.  It was very odd, Markheim\ndid not appear to be laughing; there was something in his face like an\neager sparkle of hope, but nothing of mirth.\n\n'What are you driving at?' the dealer asked.\n\n'Not charitable?' returned the other, gloomily.  Not charitable; not\npious; not scrupulous; unloving, unbeloved; a hand to get money, a safe\nto keep it.  Is that all?  Dear God, man, is that all?'\n\n'I will tell you what it is,' began the dealer, with some sharpness, and\nthen broke off again into a chuckle.  'But I see this is a love match of\nyours, and you have been drinking the lady's health.'\n\n'Ah!' cried Markheim, with a strange curiosity.  'Ah, have you been in\nlove?  Tell me about that.'\n\n'I,' cried the dealer.  'I in love!  I never had the time, nor have I the\ntime to-day for all this nonsense.  Will you take the glass?'\n\n'Where is the hurry?' returned Markheim.  'It is very pleasant to stand\nhere talking; and life is so short and insecure that I would not hurry\naway from any pleasure--no, not even from so mild a one as this.  We\nshould rather cling, cling to what little we can get, like a man at a\ncliff's edge.  Every second is a cliff, if you think upon it--a cliff a\nmile high--high enough, if we fall, to dash us out of every feature of\nhumanity.  Hence it is best to talk pleasantly.  Let us talk of each\nother: why should we wear this mask?  Let us be confidential.  Who knows,\nwe might become friends?'\n\n'I have just one word to say to you,' said the dealer.  'Either make your\npurchase, or walk out of my shop!'\n\n'True true,' said Markheim.  'Enough, fooling.  To business.  Show me\nsomething else.'\n\nThe dealer stooped once more, this time to replace the glass upon the\nshelf, his thin blond hair falling over his eyes as he did so.  Markheim\nmoved a little nearer, with one hand in the pocket of his greatcoat; he\ndrew himself up and filled his lungs; at the same time many different\nemotions were depicted together on his face--terror, horror, and resolve,\nfascination and a physical repulsion; and through a haggard lift of his\nupper lip, his teeth looked out.\n\n'This, perhaps, may suit,' observed the dealer: and then, as he began to\nre-arise, Markheim bounded from behind upon his victim.  The long,\nskewerlike dagger flashed and fell.  The dealer struggled like a hen,\nstriking his temple on the shelf, and then tumbled on the floor in a\nheap.\n\nTime had some score of small voices in that shop, some stately and slow\nas was becoming to their great age; others garrulous and hurried.  All\nthese told out the seconds in an intricate, chorus of tickings.  Then the\npassage of a lad's feet, heavily running on the pavement, broke in upon\nthese smaller voices and startled Markheim into the consciousness of his\nsurroundings.  He looked about him awfully.  The candle stood on the\ncounter, its flame solemnly wagging in a draught; and by that\ninconsiderable movement, the whole room was filled with noiseless bustle\nand kept heaving like a sea: the tall shadows nodding, the gross blots of\ndarkness swelling and dwindling as with respiration, the faces of the\nportraits and the china gods changing and wavering like images in water.\nThe inner door stood ajar, and peered into that leaguer of shadows with a\nlong slit of daylight like a pointing finger.\n\nFrom these fear-stricken rovings, Markheim's eyes returned to the body of\nhis victim, where it lay both humped and sprawling, incredibly small and\nstrangely meaner than in life.  In these poor, miserly clothes, in that\nungainly attitude, the dealer lay like so much sawdust.  Markheim had\nfeared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing.  And yet, as he gazed, this\nbundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find eloquent voices.\nThere it must lie; there was none to work the cunning hinges or direct\nthe miracle of locomotion--there it must lie till it was found.  Found!\nay, and then?  Then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that would ring\nover England, and fill the world with the echoes of pursuit.  Ay, dead or\nnot, this was still the enemy.  'Time was that when the brains were out,'\nhe thought; and the first word struck into his mind.  Time, now that the\ndeed was accomplished--time, which had closed for the victim, had become\ninstant and momentous for the slayer.\n\nThe thought was yet in his mind, when, first one and then another, with\nevery variety of pace and voice--one deep as the bell from a cathedral\nturret, another ringing on its treble notes the prelude of a waltz-the\nclocks began to strike the hour of three in the afternoon.\n\nThe sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb chamber staggered\nhim.  He began to bestir himself, going to and fro with the candle,\nbeleaguered by moving shadows, and startled to the soul by chance\nreflections.  In many rich mirrors, some of home design, some from Venice\nor Amsterdam, he saw his face repeated and repeated, as it were an army\nof spies; his own eyes met and detected him; and the sound of his own\nsteps, lightly as they fell, vexed the surrounding quiet.  And still, as\nhe continued to fill his pockets, his mind accused him with a sickening\niteration, of the thousand faults of his design.  He should have chosen a\nmore quiet hour; he should have prepared an alibi; he should not have\nused a knife; he should have been more cautious, and only bound and\ngagged the dealer, and not killed him; he should have been more bold, and\nkilled the servant also; he should have done all things otherwise:\npoignant regrets, weary, incessant toiling of the mind to change what was\nunchangeable, to plan what was now useless, to be the architect of the\nirrevocable past.  Meanwhile, and behind all this activity, brute\nterrors, like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic, filled the more\nremote chambers of his brain with riot; the hand of the constable would\nfall heavy on his shoulder, and his nerves would jerk like a hooked fish;\nor he beheld, in galloping defile, the dock, the prison, the gallows, and\nthe black coffin.\n\nTerror of the people in the street sat down before his mind like a\nbesieging army.  It was impossible, he thought, but that some rumour of\nthe struggle must have reached their ears and set on edge their\ncuriosity; and now, in all the neighbouring houses, he divined them\nsitting motionless and with uplifted ear--solitary people, condemned to\nspend Christmas dwelling alone on memories of the past, and now\nstartingly recalled from that tender exercise; happy family parties\nstruck into silence round the table, the mother still with raised finger:\nevery degree and age and humour, but all, by their own hearths, prying\nand hearkening and weaving the rope that was to hang him.  Sometimes it\nseemed to him he could not move too softly; the clink of the tall\nBohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell; and alarmed by the bigness\nof the ticking, he was tempted to stop the clocks.  And then, again, with\na swift transition of his terrors, the very silence of the place appeared\na source of peril, and a thing to strike and freeze the passer-by; and he\nwould step more boldly, and bustle aloud among the contents of the shop,\nand imitate, with elaborate bravado, the movements of a busy man at ease\nin his own house.\n\nBut he was now so pulled about by different alarms that, while one\nportion of his mind was still alert and cunning, another trembled on the\nbrink of lunacy.  One hallucination in particular took a strong hold on\nhis credulity.  The neighbour hearkening with white face beside his\nwindow, the passer-by arrested by a horrible surmise on the\npavement--these could at worst suspect, they could not know; through the\nbrick walls and shuttered windows only sounds could penetrate.  But here,\nwithin the house, was he alone?  He knew he was; he had watched the\nservant set forth sweet-hearting, in her poor best, 'out for the day'\nwritten in every ribbon and smile.  Yes, he was alone, of course; and\nyet, in the bulk of empty house above him, he could surely hear a stir of\ndelicate footing--he was surely conscious, inexplicably conscious of some\npresence.  Ay, surely; to every room and corner of the house his\nimagination followed it; and now it was a faceless thing, and yet had\neyes to see with; and again it was a shadow of himself; and yet again\nbehold the image of the dead dealer, reinspired with cunning and hatred.\n\nAt times, with a strong effort, he would glance at the open door which\nstill seemed to repel his eyes.  The house was tall, the skylight small\nand dirty, the day blind with fog; and the light that filtered down to\nthe ground story was exceedingly faint, and showed dimly on the threshold\nof the shop.  And yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness, did there\nnot hang wavering a shadow?\n\nSuddenly, from the street outside, a very jovial gentleman began to beat\nwith a staff on the shop-door, accompanying his blows with shouts and\nrailleries in which the dealer was continually called upon by name.\nMarkheim, smitten into ice, glanced at the dead man.  But no! he lay\nquite still; he was fled away far beyond earshot of these blows and\nshoutings; he was sunk beneath seas of silence; and his name, which would\nonce have caught his notice above the howling of a storm, had become an\nempty sound.  And presently the jovial gentleman desisted from his\nknocking, and departed.\n\nHere was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be done, to get forth\nfrom this accusing neighbourhood, to plunge into a bath of London\nmultitudes, and to reach, on the other side of day, that haven of safety\nand apparent innocence--his bed.  One visitor had come: at any moment\nanother might follow and be more obstinate.  To have done the deed, and\nyet not to reap the profit, would be too abhorrent a failure.  The money,\nthat was now Markheim's concern; and as a means to that, the keys.\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the open door, where the shadow was still\nlingering and shivering; and with no conscious repugnance of the mind,\nyet with a tremor of the belly, he drew near the body of his victim.  The\nhuman character had quite departed.  Like a suit half-stuffed with bran,\nthe limbs lay scattered, the trunk doubled, on the floor; and yet the\nthing repelled him.  Although so dingy and inconsiderable to the eye, he\nfeared it might have more significance to the touch.  He took the body by\nthe shoulders, and turned it on its back.  It was strangely light and\nsupple, and the limbs, as if they had been broken, fell into the oddest\npostures.  The face was robbed of all expression; but it was as pale as\nwax, and shockingly smeared with blood about one temple.  That was, for\nMarkheim, the one displeasing circumstance.  It carried him back, upon\nthe instant, to a certain fair-day in a fishers' village: a gray day, a\npiping wind, a crowd upon the street, the blare of brasses, the booming\nof drums, the nasal voice of a ballad singer; and a boy going to and fro,\nburied over head in the crowd and divided between interest and fear,\nuntil, coming out upon the chief place of concourse, he beheld a booth\nand a great screen with pictures, dismally designed, garishly coloured:\nBrown-rigg with her apprentice; the Mannings with their murdered guest;\nWeare in the death-grip of Thurtell; and a score besides of famous\ncrimes.  The thing was as clear as an illusion; he was once again that\nlittle boy; he was looking once again, and with the same sense of\nphysical revolt, at these vile pictures; he was still stunned by the\nthumping of the drums.  A bar of that day's music returned upon his\nmemory; and at that, for the first time, a qualm came over him, a breath\nof nausea, a sudden weakness of the joints, which he must instantly\nresist and conquer.\n\nHe judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from these\nconsiderations; looking the more hardily in the dead face, bending his\nmind to realise the nature and greatness of his crime.  So little a while\nago that face had moved with every change of sentiment, that pale mouth\nhad spoken, that body had been all on fire with governable energies; and\nnow, and by his act, that piece of life had been arrested, as the\nhorologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock.  So\nhe reasoned in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness;\nthe same heart which had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime,\nlooked on its reality unmoved.  At best, he felt a gleam of pity for one\nwho had been endowed in vain with all those faculties that can make the\nworld a garden of enchantment, one who had never lived and who was now\ndead.  But of penitence, no, not a tremor.\n\nWith that, shaking himself clear of these considerations, he found the\nkeys and advanced towards the open door of the shop.  Outside, it had\nbegun to rain smartly; and the sound of the shower upon the roof had\nbanished silence.  Like some dripping cavern, the chambers of the house\nwere haunted by an incessant echoing, which filled the ear and mingled\nwith the ticking of the clocks.  And, as Markheim approached the door, he\nseemed to hear, in answer to his own cautious tread, the steps of another\nfoot withdrawing up the stair.  The shadow still palpitated loosely on\nthe threshold.  He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his muscles, and\ndrew back the door.\n\nThe faint, foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare floor and stairs;\non the bright suit of armour posted, halbert in hand, upon the landing;\nand on the dark wood-carvings, and framed pictures that hung against the\nyellow panels of the wainscot.  So loud was the beating of the rain\nthrough all the house that, in Markheim's ears, it began to be\ndistinguished into many different sounds.  Footsteps and sighs, the tread\nof regiments marching in the distance, the chink of money in the\ncounting, and the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar, appeared to\nmingle with the patter of the drops upon the cupola and the gushing of\nthe water in the pipes.  The sense that he was not alone grew upon him to\nthe verge of madness.  On every side he was haunted and begirt by\npresences.  He heard them moving in the upper chambers; from the shop, he\nheard the dead man getting to his legs; and as he began with a great\neffort to mount the stairs, feet fled quietly before him and followed\nstealthily behind.  If he were but deaf, he thought, how tranquilly he\nwould possess his soul!  And then again, and hearkening with ever fresh\nattention, he blessed himself for that unresting sense which held the\noutposts and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life.  His head turned\ncontinually on his neck; his eyes, which seemed starting from their\norbits, scouted on every side, and on every side were half-rewarded as\nwith the tail of something nameless vanishing.  The four-and-twenty steps\nto the first floor were four-and-twenty agonies.\n\nOn that first storey, the doors stood ajar, three of them like three\nambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of cannon.  He could never\nagain, he felt, be sufficiently immured and fortified from men's\nobserving eyes, he longed to be home, girt in by walls, buried among\nbedclothes, and invisible to all but God.  And at that thought he\nwondered a little, recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear\nthey were said to entertain of heavenly avengers.  It was not so, at\nleast, with him.  He feared the laws of nature, lest, in their callous\nand immutable procedure, they should preserve some damning evidence of\nhis crime.  He feared tenfold more, with a slavish, superstitions terror,\nsome scission in the continuity of man's experience, some wilful\nillegality of nature.  He played a game of skill, depending on the rules,\ncalculating consequence from cause; and what if nature, as the defeated\ntyrant overthrew the chess-board, should break the mould of their\nsuccession?  The like had befallen Napoleon (so writers said) when the\nwinter changed the time of its appearance.  The like might befall\nMarkheim: the solid walls might become transparent and reveal his doings\nlike those of bees in a glass hive; the stout planks might yield under\nhis foot like quicksands and detain him in their clutch; ay, and there\nwere soberer accidents that might destroy him: if, for instance, the\nhouse should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim; or the\nhouse next door should fly on fire, and the firemen invade him from all\nsides.  These things he feared; and, in a sense, these things might be\ncalled the hands of God reached forth against sin.  But about God himself\nhe was at ease; his act was doubtless exceptional, but so were his\nexcuses, which God knew; it was there, and not among men, that he felt\nsure of justice.\n\nWhen he had got safe into the drawing-room, and shut the door behind him,\nhe was aware of a respite from alarms.  The room was quite dismantled,\nuncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing cases and incongruous\nfurniture; several great pier-glasses, in which he beheld himself at\nvarious angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures, framed and\nunframed, standing, with their faces to the wall; a fine Sheraton\nsideboard, a cabinet of marquetry, and a great old bed, with tapestry\nhangings.  The windows opened to the floor; but by great good fortune the\nlower part of the shutters had been closed, and this concealed him from\nthe neighbours.  Here, then, Markheim drew in a packing case before the\ncabinet, and began to search among the keys.  It was a long business, for\nthere were many; and it was irksome, besides; for, after all, there might\nbe nothing in the cabinet, and time was on the wing.  But the closeness\nof the occupation sobered him.  With the tail of his eye he saw the\ndoor--even glanced at it from time to time directly, like a besieged\ncommander pleased to verify the good estate of his defences.  But in\ntruth he was at peace.  The rain falling in the street sounded natural\nand pleasant.  Presently, on the other side, the notes of a piano were\nwakened to the music of a hymn, and the voices of many children took up\nthe air and words.  How stately, how comfortable was the melody!  How\nfresh the youthful voices!  Markheim gave ear to it smilingly, as he\nsorted out the keys; and his mind was thronged with answerable ideas and\nimages; church-going children and the pealing of the high organ; children\nafield, bathers by the brookside, ramblers on the brambly common, kite-\nflyers in the windy and cloud-navigated sky; and then, at another cadence\nof the hymn, back again to church, and the somnolence of summer Sundays,\nand the high genteel voice of the parson (which he smiled a little to\nrecall) and the painted Jacobean tombs, and the dim lettering of the Ten\nCommandments in the chancel.\n\nAnd as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was startled to his feet.\nA flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting gush of blood, went over him,\nand then he stood transfixed and thrilling.  A step mounted the stair\nslowly and steadily, and presently a hand was laid upon the knob, and the\nlock clicked, and the door opened.\n\nFear held Markheim in a vice.  What to expect he knew not, whether the\ndead man walking, or the official ministers of human justice, or some\nchance witness blindly stumbling in to consign him to the gallows.  But\nwhen a face was thrust into the aperture, glanced round the room, looked\nat him, nodded and smiled as if in friendly recognition, and then\nwithdrew again, and the door closed behind it, his fear broke loose from\nhis control in a hoarse cry.  At the sound of this the visitant returned.\n\n'Did you call me?' he asked, pleasantly, and with that he entered the\nroom and closed the door behind him.\n\nMarkheim stood and gazed at him with all his eyes.  Perhaps there was a\nfilm upon his sight, but the outlines of the new comer seemed to change\nand waver like those of the idols in the wavering candle-light of the\nshop; and at times he thought he knew him; and at times he thought he\nbore a likeness to himself; and always, like a lump of living terror,\nthere lay in his bosom the conviction that this thing was not of the\nearth and not of God.\n\nAnd yet the creature had a strange air of the commonplace, as he stood\nlooking on Markheim with a smile; and when he added: 'You are looking for\nthe money, I believe?' it was in the tones of everyday politeness.\n\nMarkheim made no answer.\n\n'I should warn you,' resumed the other, 'that the maid has left her\nsweetheart earlier than usual and will soon be here.  If Mr. Markheim be\nfound in this house, I need not describe to him the consequences.'\n\n'You know me?' cried the murderer.\n\nThe visitor smiled.  'You have long been a favourite of mine,' he said;\n'and I have long observed and often sought to help you.'\n\n'What are you?' cried Markheim: 'the devil?'\n\n'What I may be,' returned the other, 'cannot affect the service I propose\nto render you.'\n\n'It can,' cried Markheim; 'it does!  Be helped by you?  No, never; not by\nyou!  You do not know me yet; thank God, you do not know me!'\n\n'I know you,' replied the visitant, with a sort of kind severity or\nrather firmness.  'I know you to the soul.'\n\n'Know me!' cried Markheim.  'Who can do so?  My life is but a travesty\nand slander on myself.  I have lived to belie my nature.  All men do; all\nmen are better than this disguise that grows about and stifles them.  You\nsee each dragged away by life, like one whom bravos have seized and\nmuffled in a cloak.  If they had their own control--if you could see\ntheir faces, they would be altogether different, they would shine out for\nheroes and saints!  I am worse than most; myself is more overlaid; my\nexcuse is known to me and God.  But, had I the time, I could disclose\nmyself.'\n\n'To me?' inquired the visitant.\n\n'To you before all,' returned the murderer.  'I supposed you were\nintelligent.  I thought--since you exist--you would prove a reader of the\nheart.  And yet you would propose to judge me by my acts!  Think of it;\nmy acts!  I was born and I have lived in a land of giants; giants have\ndragged me by the wrists since I was born out of my mother--the giants of\ncircumstance.  And you would judge me by my acts!  But can you not look\nwithin?  Can you not understand that evil is hateful to me?  Can you not\nsee within me the clear writing of conscience, never blurred by any\nwilful sophistry, although too often disregarded?  Can you not read me\nfor a thing that surely must be common as humanity--the unwilling\nsinner?'\n\n'All this is very feelingly expressed,' was the reply, 'but it regards me\nnot.  These points of consistency are beyond my province, and I care not\nin the least by what compulsion you may have been dragged away, so as you\nare but carried in the right direction.  But time flies; the servant\ndelays, looking in the faces of the crowd and at the pictures on the\nhoardings, but still she keeps moving nearer; and remember, it is as if\nthe gallows itself was striding towards you through the Christmas\nstreets!  Shall I help you; I, who know all?  Shall I tell you where to\nfind the money?'\n\n'For what price?' asked Markheim.\n\n'I offer you the service for a Christmas gift,' returned the other.\n\nMarkheim could not refrain from smiling with a kind of bitter triumph.\n'No,' said he, 'I will take nothing at your hands; if I were dying of\nthirst, and it was your hand that put the pitcher to my lips, I should\nfind the courage to refuse.  It may be credulous, but I will do nothing\nto commit myself to evil.'\n\n'I have no objection to a death-bed repentance,' observed the visitant.\n\n'Because you disbelieve their efficacy!' Markheim cried.\n\n'I do not say so,' returned the other; 'but I look on these things from a\ndifferent side, and when the life is done my interest falls.  The man has\nlived to serve me, to spread black looks under colour of religion, or to\nsow tares in the wheat-field, as you do, in a course of weak compliance\nwith desire.  Now that he draws so near to his deliverance, he can add\nbut one act of service--to repent, to die smiling, and thus to build up\nin confidence and hope the more timorous of my surviving followers.  I am\nnot so hard a master.  Try me.  Accept my help.  Please yourself in life\nas you have done hitherto; please yourself more amply, spread your elbows\nat the board; and when the night begins to fall and the curtains to be\ndrawn, I tell you, for your greater comfort, that you will find it even\neasy to compound your quarrel with your conscience, and to make a\ntruckling peace with God.  I came but now from such a deathbed, and the\nroom was full of sincere mourners, listening to the man's last words: and\nwhen I looked into that face, which had been set as a flint against\nmercy, I found it smiling with hope.'\n\n'And do you, then, suppose me such a creature?' asked Markheim.  'Do you\nthink I have no more generous aspirations than to sin, and sin, and sin,\nand, at the last, sneak into heaven?  My heart rises at the thought.  Is\nthis, then, your experience of mankind? or is it because you find me with\nred hands that you presume such baseness? and is this crime of murder\nindeed so impious as to dry up the very springs of good?'\n\n'Murder is to me no special category,' replied the other.  'All sins are\nmurder, even as all life is war.  I behold your race, like starving\nmariners on a raft, plucking crusts out of the hands of famine and\nfeeding on each other's lives.  I follow sins beyond the moment of their\nacting; I find in all that the last consequence is death; and to my eyes,\nthe pretty maid who thwarts her mother with such taking graces on a\nquestion of a ball, drips no less visibly with human gore than such a\nmurderer as yourself.  Do I say that I follow sins?  I follow virtues\nalso; they differ not by the thickness of a nail, they are both scythes\nfor the reaping angel of Death.  Evil, for which I live, consists not in\naction but in character.  The bad man is dear to me; not the bad act,\nwhose fruits, if we could follow them far enough down the hurtling\ncataract of the ages, might yet be found more blessed than those of the\nrarest virtues.  And it is not because you have killed a dealer, but\nbecause you are Markheim, that I offer to forward your escape.'\n\n'I will lay my heart open to you,' answered Markheim.  'This crime on\nwhich you find me is my last.  On my way to it I have learned many\nlessons; itself is a lesson, a momentous lesson.  Hitherto I have been\ndriven with revolt to what I would not; I was a bond-slave to poverty,\ndriven and scourged.  There are robust virtues that can stand in these\ntemptations; mine was not so: I had a thirst of pleasure.  But to-day,\nand out of this deed, I pluck both warning and riches--both the power and\na fresh resolve to be myself.  I become in all things a free actor in the\nworld; I begin to see myself all changed, these hands the agents of good,\nthis heart at peace.  Something comes over me out of the past; something\nof what I have dreamed on Sabbath evenings to the sound of the church\norgan, of what I forecast when I shed tears over noble books, or talked,\nan innocent child, with my mother.  There lies my life; I have wandered a\nfew years, but now I see once more my city of destination.'\n\n'You are to use this money on the Stock Exchange, I think?' remarked the\nvisitor; 'and there, if I mistake not, you have already lost some\nthousands?'\n\n'Ah,' said Markheim, 'but this time I have a sure thing.'\n\n'This time, again, you will lose,' replied the visitor quietly.\n\n'Ah, but I keep back the half!' cried Markheim.\n\n'That also you will lose,' said the other.\n\nThe sweat started upon Markheim's brow.  'Well, then, what matter?' he\nexclaimed.  'Say it be lost, say I am plunged again in poverty, shall one\npart of me, and that the worse, continue until the end to override the\nbetter?  Evil and good run strong in me, haling me both ways.  I do not\nlove the one thing, I love all.  I can conceive great deeds,\nrenunciations, martyrdoms; and though I be fallen to such a crime as\nmurder, pity is no stranger to my thoughts.  I pity the poor; who knows\ntheir trials better than myself?  I pity and help them; I prize love, I\nlove honest laughter; there is no good thing nor true thing on earth but\nI love it from my heart.  And are my vices only to direct my life, and my\nvirtues to lie without effect, like some passive lumber of the mind?  Not\nso; good, also, is a spring of acts.'\n\nBut the visitant raised his finger.  'For six-and-thirty years that you\nhave been in this world,' said be, 'through many changes of fortune and\nvarieties of humour, I have watched you steadily fall.  Fifteen years ago\nyou would have started at a theft.  Three years back you would have\nblenched at the name of murder.  Is there any crime, is there any cruelty\nor meanness, from which you still recoil?--five years from now I shall\ndetect you in the fact!  Downward, downward, lies your way; nor can\nanything but death avail to stop you.'\n\n'It is true,' Markheim said huskily, 'I have in some degree complied with\nevil.  But it is so with all: the very saints, in the mere exercise of\nliving, grow less dainty, and take on the tone of their surroundings.'\n\n'I will propound to you one simple question,' said the other; 'and as you\nanswer, I shall read to you your moral horoscope.  You have grown in many\nthings more lax; possibly you do right to be so--and at any account, it\nis the same with all men.  But granting that, are you in any one\nparticular, however trifling, more difficult to please with your own\nconduct, or do you go in all things with a looser rein?'\n\n'In any one?' repeated Markheim, with an anguish of consideration.  'No,'\nhe added, with despair, 'in none!  I have gone down in all.'\n\n'Then,' said the visitor, 'content yourself with what you are, for you\nwill never change; and the words of your part on this stage are\nirrevocably written down.'\n\nMarkheim stood for a long while silent, and indeed it was the visitor who\nfirst broke the silence.  'That being so,' he said, 'shall I show you the\nmoney?'\n\n'And grace?' cried Markheim.\n\n'Have you not tried it?' returned the other.  'Two or three years ago,\ndid I not see you on the platform of revival meetings, and was not your\nvoice the loudest in the hymn?'\n\n'It is true,' said Markheim; 'and I see clearly what remains for me by\nway of duty.  I thank you for these lessons from my soul; my eyes are\nopened, and I behold myself at last for what I am.'\n\nAt this moment, the sharp note of the door-bell rang through the house;\nand the visitant, as though this were some concerted signal for which he\nhad been waiting, changed at once in his demeanour.\n\n'The maid!' he cried.  'She has returned, as I forewarned you, and there\nis now before you one more difficult passage.  Her master, you must say,\nis ill; you must let her in, with an assured but rather serious\ncountenance--no smiles, no overacting, and I promise you success!  Once\nthe girl within, and the door closed, the same dexterity that has already\nrid you of the dealer will relieve you of this last danger in your path.\nThenceforward you have the whole evening--the whole night, if needful--to\nransack the treasures of the house and to make good your safety.  This is\nhelp that comes to you with the mask of danger.  Up!' he cried; 'up,\nfriend; your life hangs trembling in the scales: up, and act!'\n\nMarkheim steadily regarded his counsellor.  'If I be condemned to evil\nacts,' he said, 'there is still one door of freedom open--I can cease\nfrom action.  If my life be an ill thing, I can lay it down.  Though I\nbe, as you say truly, at the beck of every small temptation, I can yet,\nby one decisive gesture, place myself beyond the reach of all.  My love\nof good is damned to barrenness; it may, and let it be!  But I have still\nmy hatred of evil; and from that, to your galling disappointment, you\nshall see that I can draw both energy and courage.'\n\nThe features of the visitor began to undergo a wonderful and lovely\nchange: they brightened and softened with a tender triumph, and, even as\nthey brightened, faded and dislimned.  But Markheim did not pause to\nwatch or understand the transformation.  He opened the door and went\ndownstairs very slowly, thinking to himself.  His past went soberly\nbefore him; he beheld it as it was, ugly and strenuous like a dream,\nrandom as chance-medley--a scene of defeat.  Life, as he thus reviewed\nit, tempted him no longer; but on the further side he perceived a quiet\nhaven for his bark.  He paused in the passage, and looked into the shop,\nwhere the candle still burned by the dead body.  It was strangely silent.\nThoughts of the dealer swarmed into his mind, as he stood gazing.  And\nthen the bell once more broke out into impatient clamour.\n\nHe confronted the maid upon the threshold with something like a smile.\n\n'You had better go for the police,' said he: 'I have killed your master.'\n\n\n\n\nTHRAWN JANET\n\n\nThe Reverend Murdoch Soulis was long minister of the moorland parish of\nBalweary, in the vale of Dule.  A severe, bleak-faced old man, dreadful\nto his hearers, he dwelt in the last years of his life, without relative\nor servant or any human company, in the small and lonely manse under the\nHanging Shaw.  In spite of the iron composure of his features, his eye\nwas wild, scared, and uncertain; and when he dwelt, in private\nadmonitions, on the future of the impenitent, it seemed as if his eye\npierced through the storms of time to the terrors of eternity.  Many\nyoung persons, coming to prepare themselves against the season of the\nHoly Communion, were dreadfully affected by his talk.  He had a sermon on\nlst Peter, v. and 8th, 'The devil as a roaring lion,' on the Sunday after\nevery seventeenth of August, and he was accustomed to surpass himself\nupon that text both by the appalling nature of the matter and the terror\nof his bearing in the pulpit.  The children were frightened into fits,\nand the old looked more than usually oracular, and were, all that day,\nfull of those hints that Hamlet deprecated.  The manse itself, where it\nstood by the water of Dule among some thick trees, with the Shaw\noverhanging it on the one side, and on the other many cold, moorish\nhilltops rising towards the sky, had begun, at a very early period of Mr.\nSoulis's ministry, to be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued\nthemselves upon their prudence; and guidmen sitting at the clachan\nalehouse shook their heads together at the thought of passing late by\nthat uncanny neighbourhood.  There was one spot, to be more particular,\nwhich was regarded with especial awe.  The manse stood between the high\nroad and the water of Dule, with a gable to each; its back was towards\nthe kirk-town of Balweary, nearly half a mile away; in front of it, a\nbare garden, hedged with thorn, occupied the land between the river and\nthe road.  The house was two stories high, with two large rooms on each.\nIt opened not directly on the garden, but on a causewayed path, or\npassage, giving on the road on the one hand, and closed on the other by\nthe tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream.  And it was this\nstrip of causeway that enjoyed among the young parishioners of Balweary\nso infamous a reputation.  The minister walked there often after dark,\nsometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers; and\nwhen he was from home, and the manse door was locked, the more daring\nschoolboys ventured, with beating hearts, to 'follow my leader' across\nthat legendary spot.\n\nThis atmosphere of terror, surrounding, as it did, a man of God of\nspotless character and orthodoxy, was a common cause of wonder and\nsubject of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or\nbusiness into that unknown, outlying country.  But many even of the\npeople of the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had marked\nthe first year of Mr. Soulis's ministrations; and among those who were\nbetter informed, some were naturally reticent, and others shy of that\nparticular topic.  Now and again, only, one of the older folk would warm\ninto courage over his third tumbler, and recount the cause of the\nminister's strange looks and solitary life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFifty years syne, when Mr. Soulis cam first into Ba'weary, he was still a\nyoung man--a callant, the folk said--fu' o' book learnin' and grand at\nthe exposition, but, as was natural in sae young a man, wi' nae leevin'\nexperience in religion.  The younger sort were greatly taken wi' his\ngifts and his gab; but auld, concerned, serious men and women were moved\neven to prayer for the young man, whom they took to be a self-deceiver,\nand the parish that was like to be sae ill-supplied.  It was before the\ndays o' the moderates--weary fa' them; but ill things are like guid--they\nbaith come bit by bit, a pickle at a time; and there were folk even then\nthat said the Lord had left the college professors to their ain devices,\nan' the lads that went to study wi' them wad hae done mair and better\nsittin' in a peat-bog, like their forbears of the persecution, wi' a\nBible under their oxter and a speerit o' prayer in their heart.  There\nwas nae doubt, onyway, but that Mr. Soulis had been ower lang at the\ncollege.  He was careful and troubled for mony things besides the ae\nthing needful.  He had a feck o' books wi' him--mair than had ever been\nseen before in a' that presbytery; and a sair wark the carrier had wi'\nthem, for they were a' like to have smoored in the Deil's Hag between\nthis and Kilmackerlie.  They were books o' divinity, to be sure, or so\nthey ca'd them; but the serious were o' opinion there was little service\nfor sae mony, when the hail o' God's Word would gang in the neuk of a\nplaid.  Then he wad sit half the day and half the nicht forbye, which was\nscant decent--writin', nae less; and first, they were feared he wad read\nhis sermons; and syne it proved he was writin' a book himsel', which was\nsurely no fittin' for ane of his years an' sma' experience.\n\nOnyway it behoved him to get an auld, decent wife to keep the manse for\nhim an' see to his bit denners; and he was recommended to an auld\nlimmer--Janet M'Clour, they ca'd her--and sae far left to himsel' as to\nbe ower persuaded.  There was mony advised him to the contrar, for Janet\nwas mair than suspeckit by the best folk in Ba'weary.  Lang or that, she\nhad had a wean to a dragoon; she hadnae come forrit {140} for maybe\nthretty year; and bairns had seen her mumblin' to hersel' up on Key's\nLoan in the gloamin', whilk was an unco time an' place for a God-fearin'\nwoman.  Howsoever, it was the laird himsel' that had first tauld the\nminister o' Janet; and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to\npleesure the laird.  When folk tauld him that Janet was sib to the deil,\nit was a' superstition by his way of it; an' when they cast up the Bible\nto him an' the witch of Endor, he wad threep it doun their thrapples that\nthir days were a' gane by, and the deil was mercifully restrained.\n\nWeel, when it got about the clachan that Janet M'Clour was to be servant\nat the manse, the folk were fair mad wi' her an' him thegether; and some\no' the guidwives had nae better to dae than get round her door cheeks and\nchairge her wi' a' that was ken't again her, frae the sodger's bairn to\nJohn Tamson's twa kye.  She was nae great speaker; folk usually let her\ngang her ain gate, an' she let them gang theirs, wi', neither Fair-guid-\neen nor Fair-guid-day; but when she buckled to, she had a tongue to deave\nthe miller.  Up she got, an' there wasnae an auld story in Ba'weary but\nshe gart somebody lowp for it that day; they couldnae say ae thing but\nshe could say twa to it; till, at the hinder end, the guidwives up and\nclaught haud of her, and clawed the coats aff her back, and pu'd her doun\nthe clachan to the water o' Dule, to see if she were a witch or no, soum\nor droun.  The carline skirled till ye could hear her at the Hangin'\nShaw, and she focht like ten; there was mony a guidwife bure the mark of\nher neist day an' mony a lang day after; and just in the hettest o' the\ncollieshangie, wha suld come up (for his sins) but the new minister.\n\n'Women,' said he (and he had a grand voice), 'I charge you in the Lord's\nname to let her go.'\n\nJanet ran to him--she was fair wud wi' terror--an' clang to him, an'\nprayed him, for Christ's sake, save her frae the cummers; an' they, for\ntheir pairt, tauld him a' that was ken't, and maybe mair.\n\n'Woman,' says he to Janet, 'is this true?'\n\n'As the Lord sees me,' says she, 'as the Lord made me, no a word o't.\nForbye the bairn,' says she, 'I've been a decent woman a' my days.'\n\n'Will you,' says Mr. Soulis, 'in the name of God, and before me, His\nunworthy minister, renounce the devil and his works?'\n\nWeel, it wad appear that when he askit that, she gave a girn that fairly\nfrichtit them that saw her, an' they could hear her teeth play dirl\nthegether in her chafts; but there was naething for it but the ae way or\nthe ither; an' Janet lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before\nthem a'.\n\n'And now,' says Mr. Soulis to the guidwives, 'home with ye, one and all,\nand pray to God for His forgiveness.'\n\nAnd he gied Janet his arm, though she had little on her but a sark, and\ntook her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy of the land; an' her\nscrieghin' and laughin' as was a scandal to be heard.\n\nThere were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht; but when\nthe morn cam' there was sic a fear fell upon a' Ba'weary that the bairns\nhid theirsels, and even the men folk stood and keekit frae their doors.\nFor there was Janet comin' doun the clachan--her or her likeness, nane\ncould tell--wi' her neck thrawn, and her heid on ae side, like a body\nthat has been hangit, and a girn on her face like an unstreakit corp.  By\nan' by they got used wi' it, and even speered at her to ken what was\nwrang; but frae that day forth she couldnae speak like a Christian woman,\nbut slavered and played click wi' her teeth like a pair o' shears; and\nfrae that day forth the name o' God cam never on her lips.  Whiles she\nwad try to say it, but it michtnae be.  Them that kenned best said least;\nbut they never gied that Thing the name o' Janet M'Clour; for the auld\nJanet, by their way o't, was in muckle hell that day.  But the minister\nwas neither to haud nor to bind; he preached about naething but the\nfolk's cruelty that had gi'en her a stroke of the palsy; he skelpt the\nbairns that meddled her; and he had her up to the manse that same nicht,\nand dwalled there a' his lane wi' her under the Hangin' Shaw.\n\nWeel, time gaed by: and the idler sort commenced to think mair lichtly o'\nthat black business.  The minister was weel thocht o'; he was aye late at\nthe writing, folk wad see his can'le doon by the Dule water after twal'\nat e'en; and he seemed pleased wi' himsel' and upsitten as at first,\nthough a' body could see that he was dwining.  As for Janet she cam an'\nshe gaed; if she didnae speak muckle afore, it was reason she should\nspeak less then; she meddled naebody; but she was an eldritch thing to\nsee, an' nane wad hae mistrysted wi' her for Ba'weary glebe.\n\nAbout the end o' July there cam' a spell o' weather, the like o't never\nwas in that country side; it was lown an' het an' heartless; the herds\ncouldnae win up the Black Hill, the bairns were ower weariet to play; an'\nyet it was gousty too, wi' claps o' het wund that rumm'led in the glens,\nand bits o' shouers that slockened naething.  We aye thocht it but to\nthun'er on the morn; but the morn cam, an' the morn's morning, and it was\naye the same uncanny weather, sair on folks and bestial.  Of a' that were\nthe waur, nane suffered like Mr. Soulis; he could neither sleep nor eat,\nhe tauld his elders; an' when he wasnae writin' at his weary book, he wad\nbe stravaguin' ower a' the countryside like a man possessed, when a' body\nelse was blythe to keep caller ben the house.\n\nAbune Hangin' Shaw, in the bield o' the Black Hill, there's a bit\nenclosed grund wi' an iron yett; and it seems, in the auld days, that was\nthe kirkyaird o' Ba'weary, and consecrated by the Papists before the\nblessed licht shone upon the kingdom.  It was a great howff o' Mr.\nSoulis's, onyway; there he would sit an' consider his sermons; and indeed\nit's a bieldy bit.  Weel, as he cam ower the wast end o' the Black Hill,\nae day, he saw first twa, an syne fower, an' syne seeven corbie craws\nfleein' round an' round abune the auld kirkyaird.  They flew laigh and\nheavy, an' squawked to ither as they gaed; and it was clear to Mr. Soulis\nthat something had put them frae their ordinar.  He wasnae easy fleyed,\nan' gaed straucht up to the wa's; an' what suld he find there but a man,\nor the appearance of a man, sittin' in the inside upon a grave.  He was\nof a great stature, an' black as hell, and his e'en were singular to see.\n{144}  Mr. Soulis had heard tell o' black men, mony's the time; but there\nwas something unco about this black man that daunted him.  Het as he was,\nhe took a kind o' cauld grue in the marrow o' his banes; but up he spak\nfor a' that; an' says he: 'My friend, are you a stranger in this place?'\nThe black man answered never a word; he got upon his feet, an' begude to\nhirsle to the wa' on the far side; but he aye lookit at the minister; an'\nthe minister stood an' lookit back; till a' in a meenute the black man\nwas ower the wa' an' rinnin' for the bield o' the trees.  Mr. Soulis, he\nhardly kenned why, ran after him; but he was sair forjaskit wi' his walk\nan' the het, unhalesome weather; and rin as he likit, he got nae mair\nthan a glisk o' the black man amang the birks, till he won doun to the\nfoot o' the hill-side, an' there he saw him ance mair, gaun, hap, step,\nan' lowp, ower Dule water to the manse.\n\nMr. Soulis wasnae weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld mak' sae\nfree wi' Ba'weary manse; an' he ran the harder, an', wet shoon, ower the\nburn, an' up the walk; but the deil a black man was there to see.  He\nstepped out upon the road, but there was naebody there; he gaed a' ower\nthe gairden, but na, nae black man.  At the hinder end, and a bit feared\nas was but natural, he lifted the hasp and into the manse; and there was\nJanet M'Clour before his een, wi' her thrawn craig, and nane sae pleased\nto see him.  And he aye minded sinsyne, when first he set his een upon\nher, he had the same cauld and deidly grue.\n\n'Janet,' says he, 'have you seen a black man?'\n\n'A black man?' quo' she.  'Save us a'!  Ye're no wise, minister.  There's\nnae black man in a Ba'weary.'\n\nBut she didnae speak plain, ye maun understand; but yam-yammered, like a\npowney wi' the bit in its moo.\n\n'Weel,' says he, 'Janet, if there was nae black man, I have spoken with\nthe Accuser of the Brethren.'\n\nAnd he sat down like ane wi' a fever, an' his teeth chittered in his\nheid.\n\n'Hoots,' says she, 'think shame to yoursel', minister;' an' gied him a\ndrap brandy that she keept aye by her.\n\nSyne Mr. Soulis gaed into his study amang a' his books.  It's a lang,\nlaigh, mirk chalmer, perishin' cauld in winter, an' no very dry even in\nthe tap o' the simmer, for the manse stands near the burn.  Sae doun he\nsat, and thocht of a' that had come an' gane since he was in Ba'weary,\nan' his hame, an' the days when he was a bairn an' ran daffin' on the\nbraes; and that black man aye ran in his heid like the ower-come of a\nsang.  Aye the mair he thocht, the mair he thocht o' the black man.  He\ntried the prayer, an' the words wouldnae come to him; an' he tried, they\nsay, to write at his book, but he could nae mak' nae mair o' that.  There\nwas whiles he thocht the black man was at his oxter, an' the swat stood\nupon him cauld as well-water; and there was other whiles, when he cam to\nhimsel' like a christened bairn and minded naething.\n\nThe upshot was that he gaed to the window an' stood glowrin' at Dule\nwater.  The trees are unco thick, an' the water lies deep an' black under\nthe manse; an' there was Janct washin' the cla'es wi' her coats kilted.\nShe had her back to the minister, an' he, for his pairt, hardly kenned\nwhat he was lookin' at.  Syne she turned round, an' shawed her face; Mr.\nSoulis had the same cauld grue as twice that day afore, an' it was borne\nin upon him what folk said, that Janet was deid lang syne, an' this was a\nbogle in her clay-cauld flesh.  He drew back a pickle and he scanned her\nnarrowly.  She was tramp-trampin' in the cla'es, croonin' to hersel'; and\neh!  Gude guide us, but it was a fearsome face.  Whiles she sang louder,\nbut there was nae man born o' woman that could tell the words o' her\nsang; an' whiles she lookit side-lang doun, but there was naething there\nfor her to look at.  There gaed a scunner through the flesh upon his\nbanes; and that was Heeven's advertisement.  But Mr. Soulis just blamed\nhimsel', he said, to think sae ill of a puir, auld afflicted wife that\nhadnae a freend forbye himsel'; an' he put up a bit prayer for him and\nher, an' drank a little caller water--for his heart rose again the\nmeat--an' gaed up to his naked bed in the gloaming.\n\nThat was a nicht that has never been forgotten in Ba'weary, the nicht o'\nthe seeventeenth of August, seventeen hun'er' an twal'.  It had been het\nafore, as I hae said, but that nicht it was hetter than ever.  The sun\ngaed doun amang unco-lookin' clouds; it fell as mirk as the pit; no a\nstar, no a breath o' wund; ye couldnae see your han' afore your face, and\neven the auld folk cuist the covers frae their beds and lay pechin' for\ntheir breath.  Wi' a' that he had upon his mind, it was gey and unlikely\nMr. Soulis wad get muckle sleep.  He lay an' he tummled; the gude, caller\nbed that he got into brunt his very banes; whiles he slept, and whiles he\nwaukened; whiles he heard the time o' nicht, and whiles a tyke yowlin' up\nthe muir, as if somebody was deid; whiles he thocht he heard bogles\nclaverin' in his lug, an' whiles he saw spunkies in the room.  He\nbehoved, he judged, to be sick; an' sick he was--little he jaloosed the\nsickness.\n\nAt the hinder end, he got a clearness in his mind, sat up in his sark on\nthe bed-side, and fell thinkin' ance mair o' the black man an' Janet.  He\ncouldnae weel tell how--maybe it was the cauld to his feet--but it cam'\nin upon him wi' a spate that there was some connection between thir twa,\nan' that either or baith o' them were bogles.  And just at that moment,\nin Janet's room, which was neist to his, there cam' a stramp o' feet as\nif men were wars'lin', an' then a loud bang; an' then a wund gaed\nreishling round the fower quarters of the house; an' then a' was aince\nmair as seelent as the grave.\n\nMr. Soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil.  He got his tinder-box,\nan' lit a can'le, an' made three steps o't ower to Janet's door.  It was\non the hasp, an' he pushed it open, an' keeked bauldly in.  It was a big\nroom, as big as the minister's ain, an' plenished wi' grand, auld, solid\ngear, for he had naething else.  There was a fower-posted bed wi' auld\ntapestry; and a braw cabinet of aik, that was fu' o' the minister's\ndivinity books, an' put there to be out o' the gate; an' a wheen duds o'\nJanet's lying here and there about the floor.  But nae Janet could Mr.\nSoulis see; nor ony sign of a contention.  In he gaed (an' there's few\nthat wad ha'e followed him) an' lookit a' round, an' listened.  But there\nwas naethin' to be heard, neither inside the manse nor in a' Ba'weary\nparish, an' naethin' to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin' round the\ncan'le.  An' then a' at aince, the minister's heart played dunt an' stood\nstock-still; an' a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o' his heid.  Whaten a\nweary sicht was that for the puir man's een!  For there was Janat hangin'\nfrae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet: her heid aye lay on her\nshoother, her een were steeked, the tongue projekit frae her mouth, and\nher heels were twa feet clear abune the floor.\n\n'God forgive us all!' thocht Mr. Soulis; 'poor Janet's dead.'\n\nHe cam' a step nearer to the corp; an' then his heart fair whammled in\nhis inside.  For by what cantrip it wad ill-beseem a man to judge, she\nwas hingin' frae a single nail an' by a single wursted thread for darnin'\nhose.\n\nIt's an awfu' thing to be your lane at nicht wi' siccan prodigies o'\ndarkness; but Mr. Soulis was strong in the Lord.  He turned an' gaed his\nways oot o' that room, and lockit the door ahint him; and step by step,\ndoon the stairs, as heavy as leed; and set doon the can'le on the table\nat the stairfoot.  He couldnae pray, he couldnae think, he was dreepin'\nwi' caul' swat, an' naething could he hear but the dunt-dunt-duntin' o'\nhis ain heart.  He micht maybe have stood there an hour, or maybe twa, he\nminded sae little; when a' o' a sudden, he heard a laigh, uncanny steer\nupstairs; a foot gaed to an' fro in the cha'mer whaur the corp was\nhingin'; syne the door was opened, though he minded weel that he had\nlockit it; an' syne there was a step upon the landin', an' it seemed to\nhim as if the corp was lookin' ower the rail and doun upon him whaur he\nstood.\n\nHe took up the can'le again (for he couldnae want the licht), and as\nsaftly as ever he could, gaed straucht out o' the manse an' to the far\nend o' the causeway.  It was aye pit-mirk; the flame o' the can'le, when\nhe set it on the grund, brunt steedy and clear as in a room; naething\nmoved, but the Dule water seepin' and sabbin' doon the glen, an' yon\nunhaly footstep that cam' ploddin doun the stairs inside the manse.  He\nkenned the foot over weel, for it was Janet's; and at ilka step that cam'\na wee thing nearer, the cauld got deeper in his vitals.  He commanded his\nsoul to Him that made an' keepit him; 'and O Lord,' said he, 'give me\nstrength this night to war against the powers of evil.'\n\nBy this time the foot was comin' through the passage for the door; he\ncould hear a hand skirt alang the wa', as if the fearsome thing was\nfeelin' for its way.  The saughs tossed an' maned thegether, a lang sigh\ncam' ower the hills, the flame o' the can'le was blawn aboot; an' there\nstood the corp of Thrawn Janet, wi' her grogram goun an' her black mutch,\nwi' the heid aye upon the shouther, an' the girn still upon the face\no't--leevin', ye wad hae said--deid, as Mr. Soulis weel kenned--upon the\nthreshold o' the manse.\n\nIt's a strange thing that the saul of man should be that thirled into his\nperishable body; but the minister saw that, an' his heart didnae break.\n\nShe didnae stand there lang; she began to move again an' cam' slowly\ntowards Mr. Soulis whaur he stood under the saughs.  A' the life o' his\nbody, a' the strength o' his speerit, were glowerin' frae his een.  It\nseemed she was gaun to speak, but wanted words, an' made a sign wi' the\nleft hand.  There cam' a clap o' wund, like a cat's fuff; oot gaed the\ncan'le, the saughs skrieghed like folk; an' Mr. Soulis kenned that, live\nor die, this was the end o't.\n\n'Witch, beldame, devil!' he cried, 'I charge you, by the power of God,\nbegone--if you be dead, to the grave--if you be damned, to hell.'\n\nAn' at that moment the Lord's ain hand out o' the Heevens struck the\nHorror whaur it stood; the auld, deid, desecrated corp o' the witch-wife,\nsae lang keepit frae the grave and hirsled round by deils, lowed up like\na brunstane spunk and fell in ashes to the grund; the thunder followed,\npeal on dirling peal, the rairing rain upon the back o' that; and Mr.\nSoulis lowped through the garden hedge, and ran, wi' skelloch upon\nskelloch, for the clachan.\n\nThat same mornin', John Christie saw the Black Man pass the Muckle Cairn\nas it was chappin' six; before eicht, he gaed by the change-house at\nKnockdow; an' no lang after, Sandy M'Lellan saw him gaun linkin' doun the\nbraes frae Kilmackerlie.  There's little doubt but it was him that\ndwalled sae lang in Janet's body; but he was awa' at last; and sinsyne\nthe deil has never fashed us in Ba'weary.\n\nBut it was a sair dispensation for the minister; lang, lang he lay ravin'\nin his bed; and frae that hour to this, he was the man ye ken the day.\n\n\n\n\nOLALLA\n\n\n'Now,' said the doctor, 'my part is done, and, I may say, with some\nvanity, well done.  It remains only to get you out of this cold and\npoisonous city, and to give you two months of a pure air and an easy\nconscience.  The last is your affair.  To the first I think I can help\nyou.  It fells indeed rather oddly; it was but the other day the Padre\ncame in from the country; and as he and I are old friends, although of\ncontrary professions, he applied to me in a matter of distress among some\nof his parishioners.  This was a family--but you are ignorant of Spain,\nand even the names of our grandees are hardly known to you; suffice it,\nthen, that they were once great people, and are now fallen to the brink\nof destitution.  Nothing now belongs to them but the residencia, and\ncertain leagues of desert mountain, in the greater part of which not even\na goat could support life.  But the house is a fine old place, and stands\nat a great height among the hills, and most salubriously; and I had no\nsooner heard my friend's tale, than I remembered you.  I told him I had a\nwounded officer, wounded in the good cause, who was now able to make a\nchange; and I proposed that his friends should take you for a lodger.\nInstantly the Padre's face grew dark, as I had maliciously foreseen it\nwould.  It was out of the question, he said.  Then let them starve, said\nI, for I have no sympathy with tatterdemalion pride.  There-upon we\nseparated, not very content with one another; but yesterday, to my\nwonder, the Padre returned and made a submission: the difficulty, he\nsaid, he had found upon enquiry to be less than he had feared; or, in\nother words, these proud people had put their pride in their pocket.  I\nclosed with the offer; and, subject to your approval, I have taken rooms\nfor you in the residencia.  The air of these mountains will renew your\nblood; and the quiet in which you will there live is worth all the\nmedicines in the world.'\n\n'Doctor,' said I, 'you have been throughout my good angel, and your\nadvice is a command.  But tell me, if you please, something of the family\nwith which I am to reside.'\n\n'I am coming to that,' replied my friend; 'and, indeed, there is a\ndifficulty in the way.  These beggars are, as I have said, of very high\ndescent and swollen with the most baseless vanity; they have lived for\nsome generations in a growing isolation, drawing away, on either hand,\nfrom the rich who had now become too high for them, and from the poor,\nwhom they still regarded as too low; and even to-day, when poverty forces\nthem to unfasten their door to a guest, they cannot do so without a most\nungracious stipulation.  You are to remain, they say, a stranger; they\nwill give you attendance, but they refuse from the first the idea of the\nsmallest intimacy.'\n\nI will not deny that I was piqued, and perhaps the feeling strengthened\nmy desire to go, for I was confident that I could break down that barrier\nif I desired.  'There is nothing offensive in such a stipulation,' said\nI; 'and I even sympathise with the feeling that inspired it.'\n\n'It is true they have never seen you,' returned the doctor politely; 'and\nif they knew you were the handsomest and the most pleasant man that ever\ncame from England (where I am told that handsome men are common, but\npleasant ones not so much so), they would doubtless make you welcome with\na better grace.  But since you take the thing so well, it matters not.  To\nme, indeed, it seems discourteous.  But you will find yourself the\ngainer.  The family will not much tempt you.  A mother, a son, and a\ndaughter; an old woman said to be halfwitted, a country lout, and a\ncountry girl, who stands very high with her confessor, and is,\ntherefore,' chuckled the physician, 'most likely plain; there is not much\nin that to attract the fancy of a dashing officer.'\n\n'And yet you say they are high-born,' I objected.\n\n'Well, as to that, I should distinguish,' returned the doctor.  'The\nmother is; not so the children.  The mother was the last representative\nof a princely stock, degenerate both in parts and fortune.  Her father\nwas not only poor, he was mad: and the girl ran wild about the residencia\ntill his death.  Then, much of the fortune having died with him, and the\nfamily being quite extinct, the girl ran wilder than ever, until at last\nshe married, Heaven knows whom, a muleteer some say, others a smuggler;\nwhile there are some who uphold there was no marriage at all, and that\nFelipe and Olalla are bastards.  The union, such as it was, was\ntragically dissolved some years ago; but they live in such seclusion, and\nthe country at that time was in so much disorder, that the precise manner\nof the man's end is known only to the priest--if even to him.'\n\n'I begin to think I shall have strange experiences,' said I.\n\n'I would not romance, if I were you,' replied the doctor; 'you will find,\nI fear, a very grovelling and commonplace reality.  Felipe, for instance,\nI have seen.  And what am I to say?  He is very rustic, very cunning,\nvery loutish, and, I should say, an innocent; the others are probably to\nmatch.  No, no, senor commandante, you must seek congenial society among\nthe great sights of our mountains; and in these at least, if you are at\nall a lover of the works of nature, I promise you will not be\ndisappointed.'\n\nThe next day Felipe came for me in a rough country cart, drawn by a mule;\nand a little before the stroke of noon, after I had said farewell to the\ndoctor, the innkeeper, and different good souls who had befriended me\nduring my sickness, we set forth out of the city by the Eastern gate, and\nbegan to ascend into the Sierra.  I had been so long a prisoner, since I\nwas left behind for dying after the loss of the convoy, that the mere\nsmell of the earth set me smiling.  The country through which we went was\nwild and rocky, partially covered with rough woods, now of the cork-tree,\nand now of the great Spanish chestnut, and frequently intersected by the\nbeds of mountain torrents.  The sun shone, the wind rustled joyously; and\nwe had advanced some miles, and the city had already shrunk into an\ninconsiderable knoll upon the plain behind us, before my attention began\nto be diverted to the companion of my drive.  To the eye, he seemed but a\ndiminutive, loutish, well-made country lad, such as the doctor had\ndescribed, mighty quick and active, but devoid of any culture; and this\nfirst impression was with most observers final.  What began to strike me\nwas his familiar, chattering talk; so strangely inconsistent with the\nterms on which I was to be received; and partly from his imperfect\nenunciation, partly from the sprightly incoherence of the matter, so very\ndifficult to follow clearly without an effort of the mind.  It is true I\nhad before talked with persons of a similar mental constitution; persons\nwho seemed to live (as he did) by the senses, taken and possessed by the\nvisual object of the moment and unable to discharge their minds of that\nimpression.  His seemed to me (as I sat, distantly giving ear) a kind of\nconversation proper to drivers, who pass much of their time in a great\nvacancy of the intellect and threading the sights of a familiar country.\nBut this was not the case of Felipe; by his own account, he was a home-\nkeeper; 'I wish I was there now,' he said; and then, spying a tree by the\nwayside, he broke off to tell me that he had once seen a crow among its\nbranches.\n\n'A crow?' I repeated, struck by the ineptitude of the remark, and\nthinking I had heard imperfectly.\n\nBut by this time he was already filled with a new idea; hearkening with a\nrapt intentness, his head on one side, his face puckered; and he struck\nme rudely, to make me hold my peace.  Then he smiled and shook his head.\n\n'What did you hear?' I asked.\n\n'O, it is all right,' he said; and began encouraging his mule with cries\nthat echoed unhumanly up the mountain walls.\n\nI looked at him more closely.  He was superlatively well-built, light,\nand lithe and strong; he was well-featured; his yellow eyes were very\nlarge, though, perhaps, not very expressive; take him altogether, he was\na pleasant-looking lad, and I had no fault to find with him, beyond that\nhe was of a dusky hue, and inclined to hairyness; two characteristics\nthat I disliked.  It was his mind that puzzled, and yet attracted me.  The\ndoctor's phrase--an innocent--came back to me; and I was wondering if\nthat were, after all, the true description, when the road began to go\ndown into the narrow and naked chasm of a torrent.  The waters thundered\ntumultuously in the bottom; and the ravine was filled full of the sound,\nthe thin spray, and the claps of wind, that accompanied their descent.\nThe scene was certainly impressive; but the road was in that part very\nsecurely walled in; the mule went steadily forward; and I was astonished\nto perceive the paleness of terror in the face of my companion.  The\nvoice of that wild river was inconstant, now sinking lower as if in\nweariness, now doubling its hoarse tones; momentary freshets seemed to\nswell its volume, sweeping down the gorge, raving and booming against the\nbarrier walls; and I observed it was at each of these accessions to the\nclamour, that my driver more particularly winced and blanched.  Some\nthoughts of Scottish superstition and the river Kelpie, passed across my\nmind; I wondered if perchance the like were prevalent in that part of\nSpain; and turning to Felipe, sought to draw him out.\n\n'What is the matter?' I asked.\n\n'O, I am afraid,' he replied.\n\n'Of what are you afraid?' I returned.  'This seems one of the safest\nplaces on this very dangerous road.'\n\n'It makes a noise,' he said, with a simplicity of awe that set my doubts\nat rest.\n\nThe lad was but a child in intellect; his mind was like his body, active\nand swift, but stunted in development; and I began from that time forth\nto regard him with a measure of pity, and to listen at first with\nindulgence, and at last even with pleasure, to his disjointed babble.\n\nBy about four in the afternoon we had crossed the summit of the mountain\nline, said farewell to the western sunshine, and began to go down upon\nthe other side, skirting the edge of many ravines and moving through the\nshadow of dusky woods.  There rose upon all sides the voice of falling\nwater, not condensed and formidable as in the gorge of the river, but\nscattered and sounding gaily and musically from glen to glen.  Here, too,\nthe spirits of my driver mended, and he began to sing aloud in a falsetto\nvoice, and with a singular bluntness of musical perception, never true\neither to melody or key, but wandering at will, and yet somehow with an\neffect that was natural and pleasing, like that of the of birds.  As the\ndusk increased, I fell more and more under the spell of this artless\nwarbling, listening and waiting for some articulate air, and still\ndisappointed; and when at last I asked him what it was he sang--'O,'\ncried he, 'I am just singing!'  Above all, I was taken with a trick he\nhad of unweariedly repeating the same note at little intervals; it was\nnot so monotonous as you would think, or, at least, not disagreeable; and\nit seemed to breathe a wonderful contentment with what is, such as we\nlove to fancy in the attitude of trees, or the quiescence of a pool.\n\nNight had fallen dark before we came out upon a plateau, and drew up a\nlittle after, before a certain lump of superior blackness which I could\nonly conjecture to be the residencia.  Here, my guide, getting down from\nthe cart, hooted and whistled for a long time in vain; until at last an\nold peasant man came towards us from somewhere in the surrounding dark,\ncarrying a candle in his hand.  By the light of this I was able to\nperceive a great arched doorway of a Moorish character: it was closed by\niron-studded gates, in one of the leaves of which Felipe opened a wicket.\nThe peasant carried off the cart to some out-building; but my guide and I\npassed through the wicket, which was closed again behind us; and by the\nglimmer of the candle, passed through a court, up a stone stair, along a\nsection of an open gallery, and up more stairs again, until we came at\nlast to the door of a great and somewhat bare apartment.  This room,\nwhich I understood was to be mine, was pierced by three windows, lined\nwith some lustrous wood disposed in panels, and carpeted with the skins\nof many savage animals.  A bright fire burned in the chimney, and shed\nabroad a changeful flicker; close up to the blaze there was drawn a\ntable, laid for supper; and in the far end a bed stood ready.  I was\npleased by these preparations, and said so to Felipe; and he, with the\nsame simplicity of disposition that I held already remarked in him,\nwarmly re-echoed my praises.  'A fine room,' he said; 'a very fine room.\nAnd fire, too; fire is good; it melts out the pleasure in your bones.  And\nthe bed,' he continued, carrying over the candle in that direction--'see\nwhat fine sheets--how soft, how smooth, smooth;' and he passed his hand\nagain and again over their texture, and then laid down his head and\nrubbed his cheeks among them with a grossness of content that somehow\noffended me.  I took the candle from his hand (for I feared he would set\nthe bed on fire) and walked back to the supper-table, where, perceiving a\nmeasure of wine, I poured out a cup and called to him to come and drink\nof it.  He started to his feet at once and ran to me with a strong\nexpression of hope; but when he saw the wine, he visibly shuddered.\n\n'Oh, no,' he said, 'not that; that is for you.  I hate it.'\n\n'Very well, Senor,' said I; 'then I will drink to your good health, and\nto the prosperity of your house and family.  Speaking of which,' I added,\nafter I had drunk, 'shall I not have the pleasure of laying my\nsalutations in person at the feet of the Senora, your mother?'\n\nBut at these words all the childishness passed out of his face, and was\nsucceeded by a look of indescribable cunning and secrecy.  He backed away\nfrom me at the same time, as though I were an animal about to leap or\nsome dangerous fellow with a weapon, and when he had got near the door,\nglowered at me sullenly with contracted pupils.  'No,' he said at last,\nand the next moment was gone noiselessly out of the room; and I heard his\nfooting die away downstairs as light as rainfall, and silence closed over\nthe house.\n\nAfter I had supped I drew up the table nearer to the bed and began to\nprepare for rest; but in the new position of the light, I was struck by a\npicture on the wall.  It represented a woman, still young.  To judge by\nher costume and the mellow unity which reigned over the canvas, she had\nlong been dead; to judge by the vivacity of the attitude, the eyes and\nthe features, I might have been beholding in a mirror the image of life.\nHer figure was very slim and strong, and of a just proportion; red\ntresses lay like a crown over her brow; her eyes, of a very golden brown,\nheld mine with a look; and her face, which was perfectly shaped, was yet\nmarred by a cruel, sullen, and sensual expression.  Something in both\nface and figure, something exquisitely intangible, like the echo of an\necho, suggested the features and bearing of my guide; and I stood awhile,\nunpleasantly attracted and wondering at the oddity of the resemblance.\nThe common, carnal stock of that race, which had been originally designed\nfor such high dames as the one now looking on me from the canvas, had\nfallen to baser uses, wearing country clothes, sitting on the shaft and\nholding the reins of a mule cart, to bring home a lodger.  Perhaps an\nactual link subsisted; perhaps some scruple of the delicate flesh that\nwas once clothed upon with the satin and brocade of the dead lady, now\nwinced at the rude contact of Felipe's frieze.\n\nThe first light of the morning shone full upon the portrait, and, as I\nlay awake, my eyes continued to dwell upon it with growing complacency;\nits beauty crept about my heart insidiously, silencing my scruples one\nafter another; and while I knew that to love such a woman were to sign\nand seal one's own sentence of degeneration, I still knew that, if she\nwere alive, I should love her.  Day after day the double knowledge of her\nwickedness and of my weakness grew clearer.  She came to be the heroine\nof many day-dreams, in which her eyes led on to, and sufficiently\nrewarded, crimes.  She cast a dark shadow on my fancy; and when I was out\nin the free air of heaven, taking vigorous exercise and healthily\nrenewing the current of my blood, it was often a glad thought to me that\nmy enchantress was safe in the grave, her wand of beauty broken, her lips\nclosed in silence, her philtre spilt.  And yet I had a half-lingering\nterror that she might not be dead after all, but re-arisen in the body of\nsome descendant.\n\nFelipe served my meals in my own apartment; and his resemblance to the\nportrait haunted me.  At times it was not; at times, upon some change of\nattitude or flash of expression, it would leap out upon me like a ghost.\nIt was above all in his ill tempers that the likeness triumphed.  He\ncertainly liked me; he was proud of my notice, which he sought to engage\nby many simple and childlike devices; he loved to sit close before my\nfire, talking his broken talk or singing his odd, endless, wordless\nsongs, and sometimes drawing his hand over my clothes with an\naffectionate manner of caressing that never failed to cause in me an\nembarrassment of which I was ashamed.  But for all that, he was capable\nof flashes of causeless anger and fits of sturdy sullenness.  At a word\nof reproof, I have seen him upset the dish of which I was about to eat,\nand this not surreptitiously, but with defiance; and similarly at a hint\nof inquisition.  I was not unnaturally curious, being in a strange place\nand surrounded by staring people; but at the shadow of a question, he\nshrank back, lowering and dangerous.  Then it was that, for a fraction of\na second, this rough lad might have been the brother of the lady in the\nframe.  But these humours were swift to pass; and the resemblance died\nalong with them.\n\nIn these first days I saw nothing of any one but Felipe, unless the\nportrait is to be counted; and since the lad was plainly of weak mind,\nand had moments of passion, it may be wondered that I bore his dangerous\nneighbourhood with equanimity.  As a matter of fact, it was for some time\nirksome; but it happened before long that I obtained over him so complete\na mastery as set my disquietude at rest.\n\nIt fell in this way.  He was by nature slothful, and much of a vagabond,\nand yet he kept by the house, and not only waited upon my wants, but\nlaboured every day in the garden or small farm to the south of the\nresidencia.  Here he would be joined by the peasant whom I had seen on\nthe night of my arrival, and who dwelt at the far end of the enclosure,\nabout half a mile away, in a rude out-house; but it was plain to me that,\nof these two, it was Felipe who did most; and though I would sometimes\nsee him throw down his spade and go to sleep among the very plants he had\nbeen digging, his constancy and energy were admirable in themselves, and\nstill more so since I was well assured they were foreign to his\ndisposition and the fruit of an ungrateful effort.  But while I admired,\nI wondered what had called forth in a lad so shuttle-witted this enduring\nsense of duty.  How was it sustained?  I asked myself, and to what length\ndid it prevail over his instincts?  The priest was possibly his inspirer;\nbut the priest came one day to the residencia.  I saw him both come and\ngo after an interval of close upon an hour, from a knoll where I was\nsketching, and all that time Felipe continued to labour undisturbed in\nthe garden.\n\nAt last, in a very unworthy spirit, I determined to debauch the lad from\nhis good resolutions, and, way-laying him at the gate, easily pursuaded\nhim to join me in a ramble.  It was a fine day, and the woods to which I\nled him were green and pleasant and sweet-smelling and alive with the hum\nof insects.  Here he discovered himself in a fresh character, mounting up\nto heights of gaiety that abashed me, and displaying an energy and grace\nof movement that delighted the eye.  He leaped, he ran round me in mere\nglee; he would stop, and look and listen, and seem to drink in the world\nlike a cordial; and then he would suddenly spring into a tree with one\nbound, and hang and gambol there like one at home.  Little as he said to\nme, and that of not much import, I have rarely enjoyed more stirring\ncompany; the sight of his delight was a continual feast; the speed and\naccuracy of his movements pleased me to the heart; and I might have been\nso thoughtlessly unkind as to make a habit of these wants, had not chance\nprepared a very rude conclusion to my pleasure.  By some swiftness or\ndexterity the lad captured a squirrel in a tree top.  He was then some\nway ahead of me, but I saw him drop to the ground and crouch there,\ncrying aloud for pleasure like a child.  The sound stirred my sympathies,\nit was so fresh and innocent; but as I bettered my pace to draw near, the\ncry of the squirrel knocked upon my heart.  I have heard and seen much of\nthe cruelty of lads, and above all of peasants; but what I now beheld\nstruck me into a passion of anger.  I thrust the fellow aside, plucked\nthe poor brute out of his hands, and with swift mercy killed it.  Then I\nturned upon the torturer, spoke to him long out of the heat of my\nindignation, calling him names at which he seemed to wither; and at\nlength, pointing toward the residencia, bade him begone and leave me, for\nI chose to walk with men, not with vermin.  He fell upon his knees, and,\nthe words coming to him with more cleanness than usual, poured out a\nstream of the most touching supplications, begging me in mercy to forgive\nhim, to forget what he had done, to look to the future.  'O, I try so\nhard,' he said.  'O, commandante, bear with Felipe this once; he will\nnever be a brute again!'  Thereupon, much more affected than I cared to\nshow, I suffered myself to be persuaded, and at last shook hands with him\nand made it up.  But the squirrel, by way of penance, I made him bury;\nspeaking of the poor thing's beauty, telling him what pains it had\nsuffered, and how base a thing was the abuse of strength.  'See, Felipe,'\nsaid I, 'you are strong indeed; but in my hands you are as helpless as\nthat poor thing of the trees.  Give me your hand in mine.  You cannot\nremove it.  Now suppose that I were cruel like you, and took a pleasure\nin pain.  I only tighten my hold, and see how you suffer.'  He screamed\naloud, his face stricken ashy and dotted with needle points of sweat; and\nwhen I set him free, he fell to the earth and nursed his hand and moaned\nover it like a baby.  But he took the lesson in good part; and whether\nfrom that, or from what I had said to him, or the higher notion he now\nhad of my bodily strength, his original affection was changed into a dog-\nlike, adoring fidelity.\n\nMeanwhile I gained rapidly in health.  The residencia stood on the crown\nof a stony plateau; on every side the mountains hemmed it about; only\nfrom the roof, where was a bartizan, there might be seen between two\npeaks, a small segment of plain, blue with extreme distance.  The air in\nthese altitudes moved freely and largely; great clouds congregated there,\nand were broken up by the wind and left in tatters on the hilltops; a\nhoarse, and yet faint rumbling of torrents rose from all round; and one\ncould there study all the ruder and more ancient characters of nature in\nsomething of their pristine force.  I delighted from the first in the\nvigorous scenery and changeful weather; nor less in the antique and\ndilapidated mansion where I dwelt.  This was a large oblong, flanked at\ntwo opposite corners by bastion-like projections, one of which commanded\nthe door, while both were loopholed for musketry.  The lower storey was,\nbesides, naked of windows, so that the building, if garrisoned, could not\nbe carried without artillery.  It enclosed an open court planted with\npomegranate trees.  From this a broad flight of marble stairs ascended to\nan open gallery, running all round and resting, towards the court, on\nslender pillars.  Thence again, several enclosed stairs led to the upper\nstoreys of the house, which were thus broken up into distinct divisions.\nThe windows, both within and without, were closely shuttered; some of the\nstone-work in the upper parts had fallen; the roof, in one place, had\nbeen wrecked in one of the flurries of wind which were common in these\nmountains; and the whole house, in the strong, beating sunlight, and\nstanding out above a grove of stunted cork-trees, thickly laden and\ndiscoloured with dust, looked like the sleeping palace of the legend.  The\ncourt, in particular, seemed the very home of slumber.  A hoarse cooing\nof doves haunted about the eaves; the winds were excluded, but when they\nblew outside, the mountain dust fell here as thick as rain, and veiled\nthe red bloom of the pomegranates; shuttered windows and the closed doors\nof numerous cellars, and the vacant, arches of the gallery, enclosed it;\nand all day long the sun made broken profiles on the four sides, and\nparaded the shadow of the pillars on the gallery floor.  At the ground\nlevel there was, however, a certain pillared recess, which bore the marks\nof human habitation.  Though it was open in front upon the court, it was\nyet provided with a chimney, where a wood fire would he always prettily\nblazing; and the tile floor was littered with the skins of animals.\n\nIt was in this place that I first saw my hostess.  She had drawn one of\nthe skins forward and sat in the sun, leaning against a pillar.  It was\nher dress that struck me first of all, for it was rich and brightly\ncoloured, and shone out in that dusty courtyard with something of the\nsame relief as the flowers of the pomegranates.  At a second look it was\nher beauty of person that took hold of me.  As she sat back--watching me,\nI thought, though with invisible eyes--and wearing at the same time an\nexpression of almost imbecile good-humour and contentment, she showed a\nperfectness of feature and a quiet nobility of attitude that were beyond\na statue's.  I took off my hat to her in passing, and her face puckered\nwith suspicion as swiftly and lightly as a pool ruffles in the breeze;\nbut she paid no heed to my courtesy.  I went forth on my customary walk a\ntrifle daunted, her idol-like impassivity haunting me; and when I\nreturned, although she was still in much the same posture, I was half\nsurprised to see that she had moved as far as the next pillar, following\nthe sunshine.  This time, however, she addressed me with some trivial\nsalutation, civilly enough conceived, and uttered in the same\ndeep-chested, and yet indistinct and lisping tones, that had already\nbaffled the utmost niceness of my hearing from her son.  I answered\nrather at a venture; for not only did I fail to take her meaning with\nprecision, but the sudden disclosure of her eyes disturbed me.  They were\nunusually large, the iris golden like Felipe's, but the pupil at that\nmoment so distended that they seemed almost black; and what affected me\nwas not so much their size as (what was perhaps its consequence) the\nsingular insignificance of their regard.  A look more blankly stupid I\nhave never met.  My eyes dropped before it even as I spoke, and I went on\nmy way upstairs to my own room, at once baffled and embarrassed.  Yet,\nwhen I came there and saw the face of the portrait, I was again reminded\nof the miracle of family descent.  My hostess was, indeed, both older and\nfuller in person; her eyes were of a different colour; her face, besides,\nwas not only free from the ill-significance that offended and attracted\nme in the painting; it was devoid of either good or bad--a moral blank\nexpressing literally naught.  And yet there was a likeness, not so much\nspeaking as immanent, not so much in any particular feature as upon the\nwhole.  It should seem, I thought, as if when the master set his\nsignature to that grave canvas, he had not only caught the image of one\nsmiling and false-eyed woman, but stamped the essential quality of a\nrace.\n\nFrom that day forth, whether I came or went, I was sure to find the\nSenora seated in the sun against a pillar, or stretched on a rug before\nthe fire; only at times she would shift her station to the top round of\nthe stone staircase, where she lay with the same nonchalance right across\nmy path.  In all these days, I never knew her to display the least spark\nof energy beyond what she expended in brushing and re-brushing her\ncopious copper-coloured hair, or in lisping out, in the rich and broken\nhoarseness of her voice, her customary idle salutations to myself.  These,\nI think, were her two chief pleasures, beyond that of mere quiescence.\nShe seemed always proud of her remarks, as though they had been\nwitticisms: and, indeed, though they were empty enough, like the\nconversation of many respectable persons, and turned on a very narrow\nrange of subjects, they were never meaningless or incoherent; nay, they\nhad a certain beauty of their own, breathing, as they did, of her entire\ncontentment.  Now she would speak of the warmth, in which (like her son)\nshe greatly delighted; now of the flowers of the pomegranate trees, and\nnow of the white doves and long-winged swallows that fanned the air of\nthe court.  The birds excited her.  As they raked the eaves in their\nswift flight, or skimmed sidelong past her with a rush of wind, she would\nsometimes stir, and sit a little up, and seem to awaken from her doze of\nsatisfaction.  But for the rest of her days she lay luxuriously folded on\nherself and sunk in sloth and pleasure.  Her invincible content at first\nannoyed me, but I came gradually to find repose in the spectacle, until\nat last it grew to be my habit to sit down beside her four times in the\nday, both coming and going, and to talk with her sleepily, I scarce knew\nof what.  I had come to like her dull, almost animal neighbourhood; her\nbeauty and her stupidity soothed and amused me.  I began to find a kind\nof transcendental good sense in her remarks, and her unfathomable good\nnature moved me to admiration and envy.  The liking was returned; she\nenjoyed my presence half-unconsciously, as a man in deep meditation may\nenjoy the babbling of a brook.  I can scarce say she brightened when I\ncame, for satisfaction was written on her face eternally, as on some\nfoolish statue's; but I was made conscious of her pleasure by some more\nintimate communication than the sight.  And one day, as I set within\nreach of her on the marble step, she suddenly shot forth one of her hands\nand patted mine.  The thing was done, and she was back in her accustomed\nattitude, before my mind had received intelligence of the caress; and\nwhen I turned to look her in the face I could perceive no answerable\nsentiment.  It was plain she attached no moment to the act, and I blamed\nmyself for my own more uneasy consciousness.\n\nThe sight and (if I may so call it) the acquaintance of the mother\nconfirmed the view I had already taken of the son.  The family blood had\nbeen impoverished, perhaps by long inbreeding, which I knew to be a\ncommon error among the proud and the exclusive.  No decline, indeed, was\nto be traced in the body, which had been handed down unimpaired in\nshapeliness and strength; and the faces of to-day were struck as sharply\nfrom the mint, as the face of two centuries ago that smiled upon me from\nthe portrait.  But the intelligence (that more precious heirloom) was\ndegenerate; the treasure of ancestral memory ran low; and it had required\nthe potent, plebeian crossing of a muleteer or mountain contrabandista to\nraise, what approached hebetude in the mother, into the active oddity of\nthe son.  Yet of the two, it was the mother I preferred.  Of Felipe,\nvengeful and placable, full of starts and shyings, inconstant as a hare,\nI could even conceive as a creature possibly noxious.  Of the mother I\nhad no thoughts but those of kindness.  And indeed, as spectators are apt\nignorantly to take sides, I grew something of a partisan in the enmity\nwhich I perceived to smoulder between them.  True, it seemed mostly on\nthe mother's part.  She would sometimes draw in her breath as he came\nnear, and the pupils of her vacant eyes would contract as if with horror\nor fear.  Her emotions, such as they were, were much upon the surface and\nreadily shared; and this latent repulsion occupied my mind, and kept me\nwondering on what grounds it rested, and whether the son was certainly in\nfault.\n\nI had been about ten days in the residencia, when there sprang up a high\nand harsh wind, carrying clouds of dust.  It came out of malarious\nlowlands, and over several snowy sierras.  The nerves of those on whom it\nblew were strung and jangled; their eyes smarted with the dust; their\nlegs ached under the burthen of their body; and the touch of one hand\nupon another grew to be odious.  The wind, besides, came down the gullies\nof the hills and stormed about the house with a great, hollow buzzing and\nwhistling that was wearisome to the ear and dismally depressing to the\nmind.  It did not so much blow in gusts as with the steady sweep of a\nwaterfall, so that there was no remission of discomfort while it blew.\nBut higher upon the mountain, it was probably of a more variable\nstrength, with accesses of fury; for there came down at times a far-off\nwailing, infinitely grievous to hear; and at times, on one of the high\nshelves or terraces, there would start up, and then disperse, a tower of\ndust, like the smoke of in explosion.\n\nI no sooner awoke in bed than I was conscious of the nervous tension and\ndepression of the weather, and the effect grew stronger as the day\nproceeded.  It was in vain that I resisted; in vain that I set forth upon\nmy customary morning's walk; the irrational, unchanging fury of the storm\nhad soon beat down my strength and wrecked my temper; and I returned to\nthe residencia, glowing with dry heat, and foul and gritty with dust.  The\ncourt had a forlorn appearance; now and then a glimmer of sun fled over\nit; now and then the wind swooped down upon the pomegranates, and\nscattered the blossoms, and set the window shutters clapping on the wall.\nIn the recess the Senora was pacing to and fro with a flushed countenance\nand bright eyes; I thought, too, she was speaking to herself, like one in\nanger.  But when I addressed her with my customary salutation, she only\nreplied by a sharp gesture and continued her walk.  The weather had\ndistempered even this impassive creature; and as I went on upstairs I was\nthe less ashamed of my own discomposure.\n\nAll day the wind continued; and I sat in my room and made a feint of\nreading, or walked up and down, and listened to the riot overhead.  Night\nfell, and I had not so much as a candle.  I began to long for some\nsociety, and stole down to the court.  It was now plunged in the blue of\nthe first darkness; but the recess was redly lighted by the fire.  The\nwood had been piled high, and was crowned by a shock of flames, which the\ndraught of the chimney brandished to and fro.  In this strong and shaken\nbrightness the Senora continued pacing from wall to wall with\ndisconnected gestures, clasping her hands, stretching forth her arms,\nthrowing back her head as in appeal to heaven.  In these disordered\nmovements the beauty and grace of the woman showed more clearly; but\nthere was a light in her eye that struck on me unpleasantly; and when I\nhad looked on awhile in silence, and seemingly unobserved, I turned tail\nas I had come, and groped my way back again to my own chamber.\n\nBy the time Felipe brought my supper and lights, my nerve was utterly\ngone; and, had the lad been such as I was used to seeing him, I should\nhave kept him (even by force had that been necessary) to take off the\nedge from my distasteful solitude.  But on Felipe, also, the wind had\nexercised its influence.  He had been feverish all day; now that the\nnight had come he was fallen into a low and tremulous humour that reacted\non my own.  The sight of his scared face, his starts and pallors and\nsudden harkenings, unstrung me; and when he dropped and broke a dish, I\nfairly leaped out of my seat.\n\n'I think we are all mad to-day,' said I, affecting to laugh.\n\n'It is the black wind,' he replied dolefully.  'You feel as if you must\ndo something, and you don't know what it is.'\n\nI noted the aptness of the description; but, indeed, Felipe had sometimes\na strange felicity in rendering into words the sensations of the body.\n'And your mother, too,' said I; 'she seems to feel this weather much.  Do\nyou not fear she may be unwell?'\n\nHe stared at me a little, and then said, 'No,' almost defiantly; and the\nnext moment, carrying his hand to his brow, cried out lamentably on the\nwind and the noise that made his head go round like a millwheel.  'Who\ncan be well?' he cried; and, indeed, I could only echo his question, for\nI was disturbed enough myself.\n\nI went to bed early, wearied with day-long restlessness, but the\npoisonous nature of the wind, and its ungodly and unintermittent uproar,\nwould not suffer me to sleep.  I lay there and tossed, my nerves and\nsenses on the stretch.  At times I would doze, dream horribly, and wake\nagain; and these snatches of oblivion confused me as to time.  But it\nmust have been late on in the night, when I was suddenly startled by an\noutbreak of pitiable and hateful cries.  I leaped from my bed, supposing\nI had dreamed; but the cries still continued to fill the house, cries of\npain, I thought, but certainly of rage also, and so savage and discordant\nthat they shocked the heart.  It was no illusion; some living thing, some\nlunatic or some wild animal, was being foully tortured.  The thought of\nFelipe and the squirrel flashed into my mind, and I ran to the door, but\nit had been locked from the outside; and I might shake it as I pleased, I\nwas a fast prisoner.  Still the cries continued.  Now they would dwindle\ndown into a moaning that seemed to be articulate, and at these times I\nmade sure they must be human; and again they would break forth and fill\nthe house with ravings worthy of hell.  I stood at the door and gave ear\nto them, till at, last they died away.  Long after that, I still lingered\nand still continued to hear them mingle in fancy with the storming of the\nwind; and when at last I crept to my bed, it was with a deadly sickness\nand a blackness of horror on my heart.\n\nIt was little wonder if I slept no more.  Why had I been locked in?  What\nhad passed?  Who was the author of these indescribable and shocking\ncries?  A human being?  It was inconceivable.  A beast?  The cries were\nscarce quite bestial; and what animal, short of a lion or a tiger, could\nthus shake the solid walls of the residencia?  And while I was thus\nturning over the elements of the mystery, it came into my mind that I had\nnot yet set eyes upon the daughter of the house.  What was more probable\nthan that the daughter of the Senora, and the sister of Felipe, should be\nherself insane?  Or, what more likely than that these ignorant and half-\nwitted people should seek to manage an afflicted kinswoman by violence?\nHere was a solution; and yet when I called to mind the cries (which I\nnever did without a shuddering chill) it seemed altogether insufficient:\nnot even cruelty could wring such cries from madness.  But of one thing I\nwas sure: I could not live in a house where such a thing was half\nconceivable, and not probe the matter home and, if necessary, interfere.\n\nThe next day came, the wind had blown itself out, and there was nothing\nto remind me of the business of the night.  Felipe came to my bedside\nwith obvious cheerfulness; as I passed through the court, the Senora was\nsunning herself with her accustomed immobility; and when I issued from\nthe gateway, I found the whole face of nature austerely smiling, the\nheavens of a cold blue, and sown with great cloud islands, and the\nmountain-sides mapped forth into provinces of light and shadow.  A short\nwalk restored me to myself, and renewed within me the resolve to plumb\nthis mystery; and when, from the vantage of my knoll, I had seen Felipe\npass forth to his labours in the garden, I returned at once to the\nresidencia to put my design in practice.  The Senora appeared plunged in\nslumber; I stood awhile and marked her, but she did not stir; even if my\ndesign were indiscreet, I had little to fear from such a guardian; and\nturning away, I mounted to the gallery and began my exploration of the\nhouse.\n\nAll morning I went from one door to another, and entered spacious and\nfaded chambers, some rudely shuttered, some receiving their full charge\nof daylight, all empty and unhomely.  It was a rich house, on which Time\nhad breathed his tarnish and dust had scattered disillusion.  The spider\nswung there; the bloated tarantula scampered on the cornices; ants had\ntheir crowded highways on the floor of halls of audience; the big and\nfoul fly, that lives on carrion and is often the messenger of death, had\nset up his nest in the rotten woodwork, and buzzed heavily about the\nrooms.  Here and there a stool or two, a couch, a bed, or a great carved\nchair remained behind, like islets on the bare floors, to testify of\nman's bygone habitation; and everywhere the walls were set with the\nportraits of the dead.  I could judge, by these decaying effigies, in the\nhouse of what a great and what a handsome race I was then wandering.  Many\nof the men wore orders on their breasts and had the port of noble\noffices; the women were all richly attired; the canvases most of them by\nfamous hands.  But it was not so much these evidences of greatness that\ntook hold upon my mind, even contrasted, as they were, with the present\ndepopulation and decay of that great house.  It was rather the parable of\nfamily life that I read in this succession of fair faces and shapely\nbodies.  Never before had I so realised the miracle of the continued\nrace, the creation and recreation, the weaving and changing and handing\ndown of fleshly elements.  That a child should be born of its mother,\nthat it should grow and clothe itself (we know not how) with humanity,\nand put on inherited looks, and turn its head with the manner of one\nascendant, and offer its hand with the gesture of another, are wonders\ndulled for us by repetition.  But in the singular unity of look, in the\ncommon features and common bearing, of all these painted generations on\nthe walls of the residencia, the miracle started out and looked me in the\nface.  And an ancient mirror falling opportunely in my way, I stood and\nread my own features a long while, tracing out on either hand the\nfilaments of descent and the bonds that knit me with my family.\n\nAt last, in the course of these investigations, I opened the door of a\nchamber that bore the marks of habitation.  It was of large proportions\nand faced to the north, where the mountains were most wildly figured.  The\nembers of a fire smouldered and smoked upon the hearth, to which a chair\nhad been drawn close.  And yet the aspect of the chamber was ascetic to\nthe degree of sternness; the chair was uncushioned; the floor and walls\nwere naked; and beyond the books which lay here and there in some\nconfusion, there was no instrument of either work or pleasure.  The sight\nof books in the house of such a family exceedingly amazed me; and I began\nwith a great hurry, and in momentary fear of interruption, to go from one\nto another and hastily inspect their character.  They were of all sorts,\ndevotional, historical, and scientific, but mostly of a great age and in\nthe Latin tongue.  Some I could see to bear the marks of constant study;\nothers had been torn across and tossed aside as if in petulance or\ndisapproval.  Lastly, as I cruised about that empty chamber, I espied\nsome papers written upon with pencil on a table near the window.  An\nunthinking curiosity led me to take one up.  It bore a copy of verses,\nvery roughly metred in the original Spanish, and which I may render\nsomewhat thus--\n\n   Pleasure approached with pain and shame,\n   Grief with a wreath of lilies came.\n   Pleasure showed the lovely sun;\n   Jesu dear, how sweet it shone!\n   Grief with her worn hand pointed on,\n         Jesu dear, to thee!\n\nShame and confusion at once fell on me; and, laying down the paper, I\nbeat an immediate retreat from the apartment.  Neither Felipe nor his\nmother could have read the books nor written these rough but feeling\nverses.  It was plain I had stumbled with sacrilegious feet into the room\nof the daughter of the house.  God knows, my own heart most sharply\npunished me for my indiscretion.  The thought that I had thus secretly\npushed my way into the confidence of a girl so strangely situated, and\nthe fear that she might somehow come to hear of it, oppressed me like\nguilt.  I blamed myself besides for my suspicions of the night before;\nwondered that I should ever have attributed those shocking cries to one\nof whom I now conceived as of a saint, spectral of mien, wasted with\nmaceration, bound up in the practices of a mechanical devotion, and\ndwelling in a great isolation of soul with her incongruous relatives; and\nas I leaned on the balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the\nbright close of pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent\nwoman, who just then stretched herself and delicately licked her lips as\nin the very sensuality of sloth, my mind swiftly compared the scene with\nthe cold chamber looking northward on the mountains, where the daughter\ndwelt.\n\nThat same afternoon, as I sat upon my knoll, I saw the Padre enter the\ngates of the residencia.  The revelation of the daughter's character had\nstruck home to my fancy, and almost blotted out the horrors of the night\nbefore; but at sight of this worthy man the memory revived.  I descended,\nthen, from the knoll, and making a circuit among the woods, posted myself\nby the wayside to await his passage.  As soon as he appeared I stepped\nforth and introduced myself as the lodger of the residencia.  He had a\nvery strong, honest countenance, on which it was easy to read the mingled\nemotions with which he regarded me, as a foreigner, a heretic, and yet\none who had been wounded for the good cause.  Of the family at the\nresidencia he spoke with reserve, and yet with respect.  I mentioned that\nI had not yet seen the daughter, whereupon he remarked that that was as\nit should be, and looked at me a little askance.  Lastly, I plucked up\ncourage to refer to the cries that had disturbed me in the night.  He\nheard me out in silence, and then stopped and partly turned about, as\nthough to mark beyond doubt that he was dismissing me.\n\n'Do you take tobacco powder?' said he, offering his snuff-box; and then,\nwhen I had refused, 'I am an old man,' he added, 'and I may be allowed to\nremind you that you are a guest.'\n\n'I have, then, your authority,' I returned, firmly enough, although I\nflushed at the implied reproof, 'to let things take their course, and not\nto interfere?'\n\nHe said 'yes,' and with a somewhat uneasy salute turned and left me where\nI was.  But he had done two things: he had set my conscience at rest, and\nhe had awakened my delicacy.  I made a great effort, once more dismissed\nthe recollections of the night, and fell once more to brooding on my\nsaintly poetess.  At the same time, I could not quite forget that I had\nbeen locked in, and that night when Felipe brought me my supper I\nattacked him warily on both points of interest.\n\n'I never see your sister,' said I casually.\n\n'Oh, no,' said he; 'she is a good, good girl,' and his mind instantly\nveered to something else.\n\n'Your sister is pious, I suppose?' I asked in the next pause.\n\n'Oh!' he cried, joining his hands with extreme fervour, 'a saint; it is\nshe that keeps me up.'\n\n'You are very fortunate,' said I, 'for the most of us, I am afraid, and\nmyself among the number, are better at going down.'\n\n'Senor,' said Felipe earnestly, 'I would not say that.  You should not\ntempt your angel.  If one goes down, where is he to stop?'\n\n'Why, Felipe,' said I, 'I had no guess you were a preacher, and I may say\na good one; but I suppose that is your sister's doing?'\n\nHe nodded at me with round eyes.\n\n'Well, then,' I continued, 'she has doubtless reproved you for your sin\nof cruelty?'\n\n'Twelve times!' he cried; for this was the phrase by which the odd\ncreature expressed the sense of frequency.  'And I told her you had done\nso--I remembered that,' he added proudly--'and she was pleased.'\n\n'Then, Felipe,' said I, 'what were those cries that I heard last night?\nfor surely they were cries of some creature in suffering.'\n\n'The wind,' returned Felipe, looking in the fire.\n\nI took his hand in mine, at which, thinking it to be a caress, he smiled\nwith a brightness of pleasure that came near disarming my resolve.  But I\ntrod the weakness down.  'The wind,' I repeated; 'and yet I think it was\nthis hand,' holding it up, 'that had first locked me in.'  The lad shook\nvisibly, but answered never a word.  'Well,' said I, 'I am a stranger and\na guest.  It is not my part either to meddle or to judge in your affairs;\nin these you shall take your sister's counsel, which I cannot doubt to be\nexcellent.  But in so far as concerns my own I will be no man's prisoner,\nand I demand that key.'  Half an hour later my door was suddenly thrown\nopen, and the key tossed ringing on the floor.\n\nA day or two after I came in from a walk a little before the point of\nnoon.  The Senora was lying lapped in slumber on the threshold of the\nrecess; the pigeons dozed below the eaves like snowdrifts; the house was\nunder a deep spell of noontide quiet; and only a wandering and gentle\nwind from the mountain stole round the galleries, rustled among the\npomegranates, and pleasantly stirred the shadows.  Something in the\nstillness moved me to imitation, and I went very lightly across the court\nand up the marble staircase.  My foot was on the topmost round, when a\ndoor opened, and I found myself face to face with Olalla.  Surprise\ntransfixed me; her loveliness struck to my heart; she glowed in the deep\nshadow of the gallery, a gem of colour; her eyes took hold upon mine and\nclung there, and bound us together like the joining of hands; and the\nmoments we thus stood face to face, drinking each other in, were\nsacramental and the wedding of souls.  I know not how long it was before\nI awoke out of a deep trance, and, hastily bowing, passed on into the\nupper stair.  She did not move, but followed me with her great, thirsting\neyes; and as I passed out of sight it seemed to me as if she paled and\nfaded.\n\nIn my own room, I opened the window and looked out, and could not think\nwhat change had come upon that austere field of mountains that it should\nthus sing and shine under the lofty heaven.  I had seen her--Olalla!  And\nthe stone crags answered, Olalla! and the dumb, unfathomable azure\nanswered, Olalla!  The pale saint of my dreams had vanished for ever; and\nin her place I beheld this maiden on whom God had lavished the richest\ncolours and the most exuberant energies of life, whom he had made active\nas a deer, slender as a reed, and in whose great eyes he had lighted the\ntorches of the soul.  The thrill of her young life, strung like a wild\nanimal's, had entered into me; the force of soul that had looked out from\nher eyes and conquered mine, mantled about my heart and sprang to my lips\nin singing.  She passed through my veins: she was one with me.\n\nI will not say that this enthusiasm declined; rather my soul held out in\nits ecstasy as in a strong castle, and was there besieged by cold and\nsorrowful considerations.  I could not doubt but that I loved her at\nfirst sight, and already with a quivering ardour that was strange to my\nexperience.  What then was to follow?  She was the child of an afflicted\nhouse, the Senora's daughter, the sister of Felipe; she bore it even in\nher beauty.  She had the lightness and swiftness of the one, swift as an\narrow, light as dew; like the other, she shone on the pale background of\nthe world with the brilliancy of flowers.  I could not call by the name\nof brother that half-witted lad, nor by the name of mother that immovable\nand lovely thing of flesh, whose silly eyes and perpetual simper now\nrecurred to my mind like something hateful.  And if I could not marry,\nwhat then?  She was helplessly unprotected; her eyes, in that single and\nlong glance which had been all our intercourse, had confessed a weakness\nequal to my own; but in my heart I knew her for the student of the cold\nnorthern chamber, and the writer of the sorrowful lines; and this was a\nknowledge to disarm a brute.  To flee was more than I could find courage\nfor; but I registered a vow of unsleeping circumspection.\n\nAs I turned from the window, my eyes alighted on the portrait.  It had\nfallen dead, like a candle after sunrise; it followed me with eyes of\npaint.  I knew it to be like, and marvelled at the tenacity of type in\nthat declining race; but the likeness was swallowed up in difference.  I\nremembered how it had seemed to me a thing unapproachable in the life, a\ncreature rather of the painter's craft than of the modesty of nature, and\nI marvelled at the thought, and exulted in the image of Olalla.  Beauty I\nhad seen before, and not been charmed, and I had been often drawn to\nwomen, who were not beautiful except to me; but in Olalla all that I\ndesired and had not dared to imagine was united.\n\nI did not see her the next day, and my heart ached and my eyes longed for\nher, as men long for morning.  But the day after, when I returned, about\nmy usual hour, she was once more on the gallery, and our looks once more\nmet and embraced.  I would have spoken, I would have drawn near to her;\nbut strongly as she plucked at my heart, drawing me like a magnet,\nsomething yet more imperious withheld me; and I could only bow and pass\nby; and she, leaving my salutation unanswered, only followed me with her\nnoble eyes.\n\nI had now her image by rote, and as I conned the traits in memory it\nseemed as if I read her very heart.  She was dressed with something of\nher mother's coquetry, and love of positive colour.  Her robe, which I\nknow she must have made with her own hands, clung about her with a\ncunning grace.  After the fashion of that country, besides, her bodice\nstood open in the middle, in a long slit, and here, in spite of the\npoverty of the house, a gold coin, hanging by a ribbon, lay on her brown\nbosom.  These were proofs, had any been needed, of her inborn delight in\nlife and her own loveliness.  On the other hand, in her eyes that hung\nupon mine, I could read depth beyond depth of passion and sadness, lights\nof poetry and hope, blacknesses of despair, and thoughts that were above\nthe earth.  It was a lovely body, but the inmate, the soul, was more than\nworthy of that lodging.  Should I leave this incomparable flower to\nwither unseen on these rough mountains?  Should I despise the great gift\noffered me in the eloquent silence of her eyes?  Here was a soul immured;\nshould I not burst its prison?  All side considerations fell off from me;\nwere she the child of Herod I swore I should make her mine; and that very\nevening I set myself, with a mingled sense of treachery and disgrace, to\ncaptivate the brother.  Perhaps I read him with more favourable eyes,\nperhaps the thought of his sister always summoned up the better qualities\nof that imperfect soul; but he had never seemed to me so amiable, and his\nvery likeness to Olalla, while it annoyed, yet softened me.\n\nA third day passed in vain--an empty desert of hours.  I would not lose a\nchance, and loitered all afternoon in the court where (to give myself a\ncountenance) I spoke more than usual with the Senora.  God knows it was\nwith a most tender and sincere interest that I now studied her; and even\nas for Felipe, so now for the mother, I was conscious of a growing warmth\nof toleration.  And yet I wondered.  Even while I spoke with her, she\nwould doze off into a little sleep, and presently awake again without\nembarrassment; and this composure staggered me.  And again, as I marked\nher make infinitesimal changes in her posture, savouring and lingering on\nthe bodily pleasure of the movement, I was driven to wonder at this depth\nof passive sensuality.  She lived in her body; and her consciousness was\nall sunk into and disseminated through her members, where it luxuriously\ndwelt.  Lastly, I could not grow accustomed to her eyes.  Each time she\nturned on me these great beautiful and meaningless orbs, wide open to the\nday, but closed against human inquiry--each time I had occasion to\nobserve the lively changes of her pupils which expanded and contracted in\na breath--I know not what it was came over me, I can find no name for the\nmingled feeling of disappointment, annoyance, and distaste that jarred\nalong my nerves.  I tried her on a variety of subjects, equally in vain;\nand at last led the talk to her daughter.  But even there she proved\nindifferent; said she was pretty, which (as with children) was her\nhighest word of commendation, but was plainly incapable of any higher\nthought; and when I remarked that Olalla seemed silent, merely yawned in\nmy face and replied that speech was of no great use when you had nothing\nto say.  'People speak much, very much,' she added, looking at me with\nexpanded pupils; and then again yawned and again showed me a mouth that\nwas as dainty as a toy.  This time I took the hint, and, leaving her to\nher repose, went up into my own chamber to sit by the open window,\nlooking on the hills and not beholding them, sunk in lustrous and deep\ndreams, and hearkening in fancy to the note of a voice that I had never\nheard.\n\nI awoke on the fifth morning with a brightness of anticipation that\nseemed to challenge fate.  I was sure of myself, light of heart and foot,\nand resolved to put my love incontinently to the touch of knowledge.  It\nshould lie no longer under the bonds of silence, a dumb thing, living by\nthe eye only, like the love of beasts; but should now put on the spirit,\nand enter upon the joys of the complete human intimacy.  I thought of it\nwith wild hopes, like a voyager to El Dorado; into that unknown and\nlovely country of her soul, I no longer trembled to adventure.  Yet when\nI did indeed encounter her, the same force of passion descended on me and\nat once submerged my mind; speech seemed to drop away from me like a\nchildish habit; and I but drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to\nthe margin of a gulf.  She drew back from me a little as I came; but her\neyes did not waver from mine, and these lured me forward.  At last, when\nI was already within reach of her, I stopped.  Words were denied me; if I\nadvanced I could but clasp her to my heart in silence; and all that was\nsane in me, all that was still unconquered, revolted against the thought\nof such an accost.  So we stood for a second, all our life in our eyes,\nexchanging salvos of attraction and yet each resisting; and then, with a\ngreat effort of the will, and conscious at the same time of a sudden\nbitterness of disappointment, I turned and went away in the same silence.\n\nWhat power lay upon me that I could not speak?  And she, why was she also\nsilent?  Why did she draw away before me dumbly, with fascinated eyes?\nWas this love? or was it a mere brute attraction, mindless and\ninevitable, like that of the magnet for the steel?  We had never spoken,\nwe were wholly strangers: and yet an influence, strong as the grasp of a\ngiant, swept us silently together.  On my side, it filled me with\nimpatience; and yet I was sure that she was worthy; I had seen her books,\nread her verses, and thus, in a sense, divined the soul of my mistress.\nBut on her side, it struck me almost cold.  Of me, she knew nothing but\nmy bodily favour; she was drawn to me as stones fall to the earth; the\nlaws that rule the earth conducted her, unconsenting, to my arms; and I\ndrew back at the thought of such a bridal, and began to be jealous for\nmyself.  It was not thus that I desired to be loved.  And then I began to\nfall into a great pity for the girl herself.  I thought how sharp must be\nher mortification, that she, the student, the recluse, Felipe's saintly\nmonitress, should have thus confessed an overweening weakness for a man\nwith whom she had never exchanged a word.  And at the coming of pity, all\nother thoughts were swallowed up; and I longed only to find and console\nand reassure her; to tell her how wholly her love was returned on my\nside, and how her choice, even if blindly made, was not unworthy.\n\nThe next day it was glorious weather; depth upon depth of blue\nover-canopied the mountains; the sun shone wide; and the wind in the\ntrees and the many falling torrents in the mountains filled the air with\ndelicate and haunting music.  Yet I was prostrated with sadness.  My\nheart wept for the sight of Olalla, as a child weeps for its mother.  I\nsat down on a boulder on the verge of the low cliffs that bound the\nplateau to the north.  Thence I looked down into the wooded valley of a\nstream, where no foot came.  In the mood I was in, it was even touching\nto behold the place untenanted; it lacked Olalla; and I thought of the\ndelight and glory of a life passed wholly with her in that strong air,\nand among these rugged and lovely surroundings, at first with a\nwhimpering sentiment, and then again with such a fiery joy that I seemed\nto grow in strength and stature, like a Samson.\n\nAnd then suddenly I was aware of Olalla drawing near.  She appeared out\nof a grove of cork-trees, and came straight towards me; and I stood up\nand waited.  She seemed in her walking a creature of such life and fire\nand lightness as amazed me; yet she came quietly and slowly.  Her energy\nwas in the slowness; but for inimitable strength, I felt she would have\nrun, she would have flown to me.  Still, as she approached, she kept her\neyes lowered to the ground; and when she had drawn quite near, it was\nwithout one glance that she addressed me.  At the first note of her voice\nI started.  It was for this I had been waiting; this was the last test of\nmy love.  And lo, her enunciation was precise and clear, not lisping and\nincomplete like that of her family; and the voice, though deeper than\nusual with women, was still both youthful and womanly.  She spoke in a\nrich chord; golden contralto strains mingled with hoarseness, as the red\nthreads were mingled with the brown among her tresses.  It was not only a\nvoice that spoke to my heart directly; but it spoke to me of her.  And\nyet her words immediately plunged me back upon despair.\n\n'You will go away,' she said, 'to-day.'\n\nHer example broke the bonds of my speech; I felt as lightened of a\nweight, or as if a spell had been dissolved.  I know not in what words I\nanswered; but, standing before her on the cliffs, I poured out the whole\nardour of my love, telling her that I lived upon the thought of her,\nslept only to dream of her loveliness, and would gladly forswear my\ncountry, my language, and my friends, to live for ever by her side.  And\nthen, strongly commanding myself, I changed the note; I reassured, I\ncomforted her; I told her I had divined in her a pious and heroic spirit,\nwith which I was worthy to sympathise, and which I longed to share and\nlighten.  'Nature,' I told her, 'was the voice of God, which men disobey\nat peril; and if we were thus humbly drawn together, ay, even as by a\nmiracle of love, it must imply a divine fitness in our souls; we must be\nmade,' I said--'made for one another.  We should be mad rebels,' I cried\nout--'mad rebels against God, not to obey this instinct.'\n\nShe shook her head.  'You will go to-day,' she repeated, and then with a\ngesture, and in a sudden, sharp note--'no, not to-day,' she cried, 'to-\nmorrow!'\n\nBut at this sign of relenting, power came in upon me in a tide.  I\nstretched out my arms and called upon her name; and she leaped to me and\nclung to me.  The hills rocked about us, the earth quailed; a shock as of\na blow went through me and left me blind and dizzy.  And the next moment\nshe had thrust me back, broken rudely from my arms, and fled with the\nspeed of a deer among the cork-trees.\n\nI stood and shouted to the mountains; I turned and went back towards the\nresidencia, waltzing upon air.  She sent me away, and yet I had but to\ncall upon her name and she came to me.  These were but the weaknesses of\ngirls, from which even she, the strangest of her sex, was not exempted.\nGo?  Not I, Olalla--O, not I, Olalla, my Olalla!  A bird sang near by;\nand in that season, birds were rare.  It bade me be of good cheer.  And\nonce more the whole countenance of nature, from the ponderous and stable\nmountains down to the lightest leaf and the smallest darting fly in the\nshadow of the groves, began to stir before me and to put on the\nlineaments of life and wear a face of awful joy.  The sunshine struck\nupon the hills, strong as a hammer on the anvil, and the hills shook; the\nearth, under that vigorous insulation, yielded up heady scents; the woods\nsmouldered in the blaze.  I felt the thrill of travail and delight run\nthrough the earth.  Something elemental, something rude, violent, and\nsavage, in the love that sang in my heart, was like a key to nature's\nsecrets; and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive\nand friendly.  Olalla!  Her touch had quickened, and renewed, and strung\nme up to the old pitch of concert with the rugged earth, to a swelling of\nthe soul that men learn to forget in their polite assemblies.  Love\nburned in me like rage; tenderness waxed fierce; I hated, I adored, I\npitied, I revered her with ecstasy.  She seemed the link that bound me in\nwith dead things on the one hand, and with our pure and pitying God upon\nthe other: a thing brutal and divine, and akin at once to the innocence\nand to the unbridled forces of the earth.\n\nMy head thus reeling, I came into the courtyard of the residencia, and\nthe sight of the mother struck me like a revelation.  She sat there, all\nsloth and contentment, blinking under the strong sunshine, branded with a\npassive enjoyment, a creature set quite apart, before whom my ardour fell\naway like a thing ashamed.  I stopped a moment, and, commanding such\nshaken tones as I was able, said a word or two.  She looked at me with\nher unfathomable kindness; her voice in reply sounded vaguely out of the\nrealm of peace in which she slumbered, and there fell on my mind, for the\nfirst time, a sense of respect for one so uniformly innocent and happy,\nand I passed on in a kind of wonder at myself, that I should be so much\ndisquieted.\n\nOn my table there lay a piece of the same yellow paper I had seen in the\nnorth room; it was written on with pencil in the same hand, Olalla's\nhand, and I picked it up with a sudden sinking of alarm, and read, 'If\nyou have any kindness for Olalla, if you have any chivalry for a creature\nsorely wrought, go from here to-day; in pity, in honour, for the sake of\nHim who died, I supplicate that you shall go.'  I looked at this awhile\nin mere stupidity, then I began to awaken to a weariness and horror of\nlife; the sunshine darkened outside on the bare hills, and I began to\nshake like a man in terror.  The vacancy thus suddenly opened in my life\nunmanned me like a physical void.  It was not my heart, it was not my\nhappiness, it was life itself that was involved.  I could not lose her.  I\nsaid so, and stood repeating it.  And then, like one in a dream, I moved\nto the window, put forth my hand to open the casement, and thrust it\nthrough the pane.  The blood spurted from my wrist; and with an\ninstantaneous quietude and command of myself, I pressed my thumb on the\nlittle leaping fountain, and reflected what to do.  In that empty room\nthere was nothing to my purpose; I felt, besides, that I required\nassistance.  There shot into my mind a hope that Olalla herself might be\nmy helper, and I turned and went down stairs, still keeping my thumb upon\nthe wound.\n\nThere was no sign of either Olalla or Felipe, and I addressed myself to\nthe recess, whither the Senora had now drawn quite back and sat dozing\nclose before the fire, for no degree of heat appeared too much for her.\n\n'Pardon me,' said I, 'if I disturb you, but I must apply to you for\nhelp.'\n\nShe looked up sleepily and asked me what it was, and with the very words\nI thought she drew in her breath with a widening of the nostrils and\nseemed to come suddenly and fully alive.\n\n'I have cut myself,' I said, 'and rather badly.  See!'  And I held out my\ntwo hands from which the blood was oozing and dripping.\n\nHer great eyes opened wide, the pupils shrank into points; a veil seemed\nto fall from her face, and leave it sharply expressive and yet\ninscrutable.  And as I still stood, marvelling a little at her\ndisturbance, she came swiftly up to me, and stooped and caught me by the\nhand; and the next moment my hand was at her mouth, and she had bitten me\nto the bone.  The pang of the bite, the sudden spurting of blood, and the\nmonstrous horror of the act, flashed through me all in one, and I beat\nher back; and she sprang at me again and again, with bestial cries, cries\nthat I recognised, such cries as had awakened me on the night of the high\nwind.  Her strength was like that of madness; mine was rapidly ebbing\nwith the loss of blood; my mind besides was whirling with the abhorrent\nstrangeness of the onslaught, and I was already forced against the wall,\nwhen Olalla ran betwixt us, and Felipe, following at a bound, pinned down\nhis mother on the floor.\n\nA trance-like weakness fell upon me; I saw, heard, and felt, but I was\nincapable of movement.  I heard the struggle roll to and fro upon the\nfloor, the yells of that catamount ringing up to Heaven as she strove to\nreach me.  I felt Olalla clasp me in her arms, her hair falling on my\nface, and, with the strength of a man, raise and half drag, half carry me\nupstairs into my own room, where she cast me down upon the bed.  Then I\nsaw her hasten to the door and lock it, and stand an instant listening to\nthe savage cries that shook the residencia.  And then, swift and light as\na thought, she was again beside me, binding up my hand, laying it in her\nbosom, moaning and mourning over it with dove-like sounds.  They were not\nwords that came to her, they were sounds more beautiful than speech,\ninfinitely touching, infinitely tender; and yet as I lay there, a thought\nstung to my heart, a thought wounded me like a sword, a thought, like a\nworm in a flower, profaned the holiness of my love.  Yes, they were\nbeautiful sounds, and they were inspired by human tenderness; but was\ntheir beauty human?\n\nAll day I lay there.  For a long time the cries of that nameless female\nthing, as she struggled with her half-witted whelp, resounded through the\nhouse, and pierced me with despairing sorrow and disgust.  They were the\ndeath-cry of my love; my love was murdered; was not only dead, but an\noffence to me; and yet, think as I pleased, feel as I must, it still\nswelled within me like a storm of sweetness, and my heart melted at her\nlooks and touch.  This horror that had sprung out, this doubt upon\nOlalla, this savage and bestial strain that ran not only through the\nwhole behaviour of her family, but found a place in the very foundations\nand story of our love--though it appalled, though it shocked and sickened\nme, was yet not of power to break the knot of my infatuation.\n\nWhen the cries had ceased, there came a scraping at the door, by which I\nknew Felipe was without; and Olalla went and spoke to him--I know not\nwhat.  With that exception, she stayed close beside me, now kneeling by\nmy bed and fervently praying, now sitting with her eyes upon mine.  So\nthen, for these six hours I drank in her beauty, and silently perused the\nstory in her face.  I saw the golden coin hover on her breaths; I saw her\neyes darken and brighter, and still speak no language but that of an\nunfathomable kindness; I saw the faultless face, and, through the robe,\nthe lines of the faultless body.  Night came at last, and in the growing\ndarkness of the chamber, the sight of her slowly melted; but even then\nthe touch of her smooth hand lingered in mine and talked with me.  To lie\nthus in deadly weakness and drink in the traits of the beloved, is to\nreawake to love from whatever shock of disillusion.  I reasoned with\nmyself; and I shut my eyes on horrors, and again I was very bold to\naccept the worst.  What mattered it, if that imperious sentiment\nsurvived; if her eyes still beckoned and attached me; if now, even as\nbefore, every fibre of my dull body yearned and turned to her?  Late on\nin the night some strength revived in me, and I spoke:--\n\n'Olalla,' I said, 'nothing matters; I ask nothing; I am content; I love\nyou.'\n\nShe knelt down awhile and prayed, and I devoutly respected her devotions.\nThe moon had begun to shine in upon one side of each of the three\nwindows, and make a misty clearness in the room, by which I saw her\nindistinctly.  When she rearose she made the sign of the cross.\n\n'It is for me to speak,' she said, 'and for you to listen.  I know; you\ncan but guess.  I prayed, how I prayed for you to leave this place.  I\nbegged it of you, and I know you would have granted me even this; or if\nnot, O let me think so!'\n\n'I love you,' I said.\n\n'And yet you have lived in the world,' she said; after a pause, 'you are\na man and wise; and I am but a child.  Forgive me, if I seem to teach,\nwho am as ignorant as the trees of the mountain; but those who learn much\ndo but skim the face of knowledge; they seize the laws, they conceive the\ndignity of the design--the horror of the living fact fades from their\nmemory.  It is we who sit at home with evil who remember, I think, and\nare warned and pity.  Go, rather, go now, and keep me in mind.  So I\nshall have a life in the cherished places of your memory: a life as much\nmy own, as that which I lead in this body.'\n\n'I love you,' I said once more; and reaching out my weak hand, took hers,\nand carried it to my lips, and kissed it.  Nor did she resist, but winced\na little; and I could see her look upon me with a frown that was not\nunkindly, only sad and baffled.  And then it seemed she made a call upon\nher resolution; plucked my hand towards her, herself at the same time\nleaning somewhat forward, and laid it on the beating of her heart.\n'There,' she cried, 'you feel the very footfall of my life.  It only\nmoves for you; it is yours.  But is it even mine?  It is mine indeed to\noffer you, as I might take the coin from my neck, as I might break a live\nbranch from a tree, and give it you.  And yet not mine!  I dwell, or I\nthink I dwell (if I exist at all), somewhere apart, an impotent prisoner,\nand carried about and deafened by a mob that I disown.  This capsule,\nsuch as throbs against the sides of animals, knows you at a touch for its\nmaster; ay, it loves you!  But my soul, does my soul?  I think not; I\nknow not, fearing to ask.  Yet when you spoke to me your words were of\nthe soul; it is of the soul that you ask--it is only from the soul that\nyou would take me.'\n\n'Olalla,' I said, 'the soul and the body are one, and mostly so in love.\nWhat the body chooses, the soul loves; where the body clings, the soul\ncleaves; body for body, soul to soul, they come together at God's signal;\nand the lower part (if we can call aught low) is only the footstool and\nfoundation of the highest.'\n\n'Have you,' she said, 'seen the portraits in the house of my fathers?\nHave you looked at my mother or at Felipe?  Have your eyes never rested\non that picture that hangs by your bed?  She who sat for it died ages\nago; and she did evil in her life.  But, look-again: there is my hand to\nthe least line, there are my eyes and my hair.  What is mine, then, and\nwhat am I?  If not a curve in this poor body of mine (which you love, and\nfor the sake of which you dotingly dream that you love me) not a gesture\nthat I can frame, not a tone of my voice, not any look from my eyes, no,\nnot even now when I speak to him I love, but has belonged to others?\nOthers, ages dead, have wooed other men with my eyes; other men have\nheard the pleading of the same voice that now sounds in your ears.  The\nhands of the dead are in my bosom; they move me, they pluck me, they\nguide me; I am a puppet at their command; and I but reinform features and\nattributes that have long been laid aside from evil in the quiet of the\ngrave.  Is it me you love, friend? or the race that made me?  The girl\nwho does not know and cannot answer for the least portion of herself? or\nthe stream of which she is a transitory eddy, the tree of which she is\nthe passing fruit?  The race exists; it is old, it is ever young, it\ncarries its eternal destiny in its bosom; upon it, like waves upon the\nsea, individual succeeds to individual, mocked with a semblance of self-\ncontrol, but they are nothing.  We speak of the soul, but the soul is in\nthe race.'\n\n'You fret against the common law,' I said.  'You rebel against the voice\nof God, which he has made so winning to convince, so imperious to\ncommand.  Hear it, and how it speaks between us!  Your hand clings to\nmine, your heart leaps at my touch, the unknown elements of which we are\ncompounded awake and run together at a look; the clay of the earth\nremembers its independent life and yearns to join us; we are drawn\ntogether as the stars are turned about in space, or as the tides ebb and\nflow, by things older and greater than we ourselves.'\n\n'Alas!' she said, 'what can I say to you?  My fathers, eight hundred\nyears ago, ruled all this province: they were wise, great, cunning, and\ncruel; they were a picked race of the Spanish; their flags led in war;\nthe king called them his cousin; the people, when the rope was slung for\nthem or when they returned and found their hovels smoking, blasphemed\ntheir name.  Presently a change began.  Man has risen; if he has sprung\nfrom the brutes, he can descend again to the same level.  The breath of\nweariness blew on their humanity and the cords relaxed; they began to go\ndown; their minds fell on sleep, their passions awoke in gusts, heady and\nsenseless like the wind in the gutters of the mountains; beauty was still\nhanded down, but no longer the guiding wit nor the human heart; the seed\npassed on, it was wrapped in flesh, the flesh covered the bones, but they\nwere the bones and the flesh of brutes, and their mind was as the mind of\nflies.  I speak to you as I dare; but you have seen for yourself how the\nwheel has gone backward with my doomed race.  I stand, as it were, upon a\nlittle rising ground in this desperate descent, and see both before and\nbehind, both what we have lost and to what we are condemned to go farther\ndownward.  And shall I--I that dwell apart in the house of the dead, my\nbody, loathing its ways--shall I repeat the spell?  Shall I bind another\nspirit, reluctant as my own, into this bewitched and tempest-broken\ntenement that I now suffer in?  Shall I hand down this cursed vessel of\nhumanity, charge it with fresh life as with fresh poison, and dash it,\nlike a fire, in the faces of posterity?  But my vow has been given; the\nrace shall cease from off the earth.  At this hour my brother is making\nready; his foot will soon be on the stair; and you will go with him and\npass out of my sight for ever.  Think of me sometimes as one to whom the\nlesson of life was very harshly told, but who heard it with courage; as\none who loved you indeed, but who hated herself so deeply that her love\nwas hateful to her; as one who sent you away and yet would have longed to\nkeep you for ever; who had no dearer hope than to forget you, and no\ngreater fear than to be forgotten.'\n\nShe had drawn towards the door as she spoke, her rich voice sounding\nsofter and farther away; and with the last word she was gone, and I lay\nalone in the moonlit chamber.  What I might have done had not I lain\nbound by my extreme weakness, I know not; but as it was there fell upon\nme a great and blank despair.  It was not long before there shone in at\nthe door the ruddy glimmer of a lantern, and Felipe coming, charged me\nwithout a word upon his shoulders, and carried me down to the great gate,\nwhere the cart was waiting.  In the moonlight the hills stood out\nsharply, as if they were of cardboard; on the glimmering surface of the\nplateau, and from among the low trees which swung together and sparkled\nin the wind, the great black cube of the residencia stood out bulkily,\nits mass only broken by three dimly lighted windows in the northern front\nabove the gate.  They were Olalla's windows, and as the cart jolted\nonwards I kept my eyes fixed upon them till, where the road dipped into a\nvalley, they were lost to my view forever.  Felipe walked in silence\nbeside the shafts, but from time to time he would cheek the mule and seem\nto look back upon me; and at length drew quite near and laid his hand\nupon my head.  There was such kindness in the touch, and such a\nsimplicity, as of the brutes, that tears broke from me like the bursting\nof an artery.\n\n'Felipe,' I said, 'take me where they will ask no questions.'\n\nHe said never a word, but he turned his mule about, end for end, retraced\nsome part of the way we had gone, and, striking into another path, led me\nto the mountain village, which was, as we say in Scotland, the kirkton of\nthat thinly peopled district.  Some broken memories dwell in my mind of\nthe day breaking over the plain, of the cart stopping, of arms that\nhelped me down, of a bare room into which I was carried, and of a swoon\nthat fell upon me like sleep.\n\nThe next day and the days following the old priest was often at my side\nwith his snuff-box and prayer book, and after a while, when I began to\npick up strength, he told me that I was now on a fair way to recovery,\nand must as soon as possible hurry my departure; whereupon, without\nnaming any reason, he took snuff and looked at me sideways.  I did not\naffect ignorance; I knew he must have seen Olalla.  'Sir,' said I, 'you\nknow that I do not ask in wantonness.  What of that family?'\n\nHe said they were very unfortunate; that it seemed a declining race, and\nthat they were very poor and had been much neglected.\n\n'But she has not,' I said.  'Thanks, doubtless, to yourself, she is\ninstructed and wise beyond the use of women.'\n\n'Yes,' he said; 'the Senorita is well-informed.  But the family has been\nneglected.'\n\n'The mother?' I queried.\n\n'Yes, the mother too,' said the Padre, taking snuff.  'But Felipe is a\nwell-intentioned lad.'\n\n'The mother is odd?' I asked.\n\n'Very odd,' replied the priest.\n\n'I think, sir, we beat about the bush,' said I.  'You must know more of\nmy affairs than you allow.  You must know my curiosity to be justified on\nmany grounds.  Will you not be frank with me?'\n\n'My son,' said the old gentleman, 'I will be very frank with you on\nmatters within my competence; on those of which I know nothing it does\nnot require much discretion to be silent.  I will not fence with you, I\ntake your meaning perfectly; and what can I say, but that we are all in\nGod's hands, and that His ways are not as our ways?  I have even advised\nwith my superiors in the church, but they, too, were dumb.  It is a great\nmystery.'\n\n'Is she mad?' I asked.\n\n'I will answer you according to my belief.  She is not,' returned the\nPadre, 'or she was not.  When she was young--God help me, I fear I\nneglected that wild lamb--she was surely sane; and yet, although it did\nnot run to such heights, the same strain was already notable; it had been\nso before her in her father, ay, and before him, and this inclined me,\nperhaps, to think too lightly of it.  But these things go on growing, not\nonly in the individual but in the race.'\n\n'When she was young,' I began, and my voice failed me for a moment, and\nit was only with a great effort that I was able to add, 'was she like\nOlalla?'\n\n'Now God forbid!' exclaimed the Padre.  'God forbid that any man should\nthink so slightingly of my favourite penitent.  No, no; the Senorita (but\nfor her beauty, which I wish most honestly she had less of) has not a\nhair's resemblance to what her mother was at the same age.  I could not\nbear to have you think so; though, Heaven knows, it were, perhaps, better\nthat you should.'\n\nAt this, I raised myself in bed, and opened my heart to the old man;\ntelling him of our love and of her decision, owning my own horrors, my\nown passing fancies, but telling him that these were at an end; and with\nsomething more than a purely formal submission, appealing to his\njudgment.\n\nHe heard me very patiently and without surprise; and when I had done, he\nsat for some time silent.  Then he began: 'The church,' and instantly\nbroke off again to apologise.  'I had forgotten, my child, that you were\nnot a Christian,' said he.  'And indeed, upon a point so highly unusual,\neven the church can scarce be said to have decided.  But would you have\nmy opinion?  The Senorita is, in a matter of this kind, the best judge; I\nwould accept her judgment.'\n\nOn the back of that he went away, nor was he thenceforward so assiduous\nin his visits; indeed, even when I began to get about again, he plainly\nfeared and deprecated my society, not as in distaste but much as a man\nmight be disposed to flee from the riddling sphynx.  The villagers, too,\navoided me; they were unwilling to be my guides upon the mountain.  I\nthought they looked at me askance, and I made sure that the more\nsuperstitious crossed themselves on my approach.  At first I set this\ndown to my heretical opinions; but it began at length to dawn upon me\nthat if I was thus redoubted it was because I had stayed at the\nresidencia.  All men despise the savage notions of such peasantry; and\nyet I was conscious of a chill shadow that seemed to fall and dwell upon\nmy love.  It did not conquer, but I may not deny that it restrained my\nardour.\n\nSome miles westward of the village there was a gap in the sierra, from\nwhich the eye plunged direct upon the residencia; and thither it became\nmy daily habit to repair.  A wood crowned the summit; and just where the\npathway issued from its fringes, it was overhung by a considerable shelf\nof rock, and that, in its turn, was surmounted by a crucifix of the size\nof life and more than usually painful in design.  This was my perch;\nthence, day after day, I looked down upon the plateau, and the great old\nhouse, and could see Felipe, no bigger than a fly, going to and fro about\nthe garden.  Sometimes mists would draw across the view, and be broken up\nagain by mountain winds; sometimes the plain slumbered below me in\nunbroken sunshine; it would sometimes be all blotted out by rain.  This\ndistant post, these interrupted sights of the place where my life had\nbeen so strangely changed, suited the indecision of my humour.  I passed\nwhole days there, debating with myself the various elements of our\nposition; now leaning to the suggestions of love, now giving an ear to\nprudence, and in the end halting irresolute between the two.\n\nOne day, as I was sitting on my rock, there came by that way a somewhat\ngaunt peasant wrapped in a mantle.  He was a stranger, and plainly did\nnot know me even by repute; for, instead of keeping the other side, he\ndrew near and sat down beside me, and we had soon fallen in talk.  Among\nother things he told me he had been a muleteer, and in former years had\nmuch frequented these mountains; later on, he had followed the army with\nhis mules, had realised a competence, and was now living retired with his\nfamily.\n\n'Do you know that house?' I inquired, at last, pointing to the\nresidencia, for I readily wearied of any talk that kept me from the\nthought of Olalla.\n\nHe looked at me darkly and crossed himself.\n\n'Too well,' he said, 'it was there that one of my comrades sold himself\nto Satan; the Virgin shield us from temptations!  He has paid the price;\nhe is now burning in the reddest place in Hell!'\n\nA fear came upon me; I could answer nothing; and presently the man\nresumed, as if to himself: 'Yes,' he said, 'O yes, I know it.  I have\npassed its doors.  There was snow upon the pass, the wind was driving it;\nsure enough there was death that night upon the mountains, but there was\nworse beside the hearth.  I took him by the arm, Senor, and dragged him\nto the gate; I conjured him, by all he loved and respected, to go forth\nwith me; I went on my knees before him in the snow; and I could see he\nwas moved by my entreaty.  And just then she came out on the gallery, and\ncalled him by his name; and he turned, and there was she standing with a\nlamp in her hand and smiling on him to come back.  I cried out aloud to\nGod, and threw my arms about him, but he put me by, and left me alone.  He\nhad made his choice; God help us.  I would pray for him, but to what end?\nthere are sins that not even the Pope can loose.'\n\n'And your friend,' I asked, 'what became of him?'\n\n'Nay, God knows,' said the muleteer.  'If all be true that we hear, his\nend was like his sin, a thing to raise the hair.'\n\n'Do you mean that he was killed?' I asked.\n\n'Sure enough, he was killed,' returned the man.  'But how?  Ay, how?  But\nthese are things that it is sin to speak of.'\n\n'The people of that house . . . ' I began.\n\nBut he interrupted me with a savage outburst.  'The people?' he cried.\n'What people?  There are neither men nor women in that house of Satan's!\nWhat? have you lived here so long, and never heard?'  And here he put his\nmouth to my ear and whispered, as if even the fowls of the mountain might\nhave over-heard and been stricken with horror.\n\nWhat he told me was not true, nor was it even original; being, indeed,\nbut a new edition, vamped up again by village ignorance and superstition,\nof stories nearly as ancient as the race of man.  It was rather the\napplication that appalled me.  In the old days, he said, the church would\nhave burned out that nest of basilisks; but the arm of the church was now\nshortened; his friend Miguel had been unpunished by the hands of men, and\nleft to the more awful judgment of an offended God.  This was wrong; but\nit should be so no more.  The Padre was sunk in age; he was even\nbewitched himself; but the eyes of his flock were now awake to their own\ndanger; and some day--ay, and before long--the smoke of that house should\ngo up to heaven.\n\nHe left me filled with horror and fear.  Which way to turn I knew not;\nwhether first to warn the Padre, or to carry my ill-news direct to the\nthreatened inhabitants of the residencia.  Fate was to decide for me;\nfor, while I was still hesitating, I beheld the veiled figure of a woman\ndrawing near to me up the pathway.  No veil could deceive my penetration;\nby every line and every movement I recognised Olalla; and keeping hidden\nbehind a corner of the rock, I suffered her to gain the summit.  Then I\ncame forward.  She knew me and paused, but did not speak; I, too,\nremained silent; and we continued for some time to gaze upon each other\nwith a passionate sadness.\n\n'I thought you had gone,' she said at length.  'It is all that you can do\nfor me--to go.  It is all I ever asked of you.  And you still stay.  But\ndo you know, that every day heaps up the peril of death, not only on your\nhead, but on ours?  A report has gone about the mountain; it is thought\nyou love me, and the people will not suffer it.'\n\nI saw she was already informed of her danger, and I rejoiced at it.\n'Olalla,' I said, 'I am ready to go this day, this very hour, but not\nalone.'\n\nShe stepped aside and knelt down before the crucifix to pray, and I stood\nby and looked now at her and now at the object of her adoration, now at\nthe living figure of the penitent, and now at the ghastly, daubed\ncountenance, the painted wounds, and the projected ribs of the image.  The\nsilence was only broken by the wailing of some large birds that circled\nsidelong, as if in surprise or alarm, about the summit of the hills.\nPresently Olalla rose again, turned towards me, raised her veil, and,\nstill leaning with one hand on the shaft of the crucifix, looked upon me\nwith a pale and sorrowful countenance.\n\n'I have laid my hand upon the cross,' she said.  'The Padre says you are\nno Christian; but look up for a moment with my eyes, and behold the face\nof the Man of Sorrows.  We are all such as He was--the inheritors of sin;\nwe must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours; there is in all\nof us--ay, even in me--a sparkle of the divine.  Like Him, we must endure\nfor a little while, until morning returns bringing peace.  Suffer me to\npass on upon my way alone; it is thus that I shall be least lonely,\ncounting for my friend Him who is the friend of all the distressed; it is\nthus that I shall be the most happy, having taken my farewell of earthly\nhappiness, and willingly accepted sorrow for my portion.'\n\nI looked at the face of the crucifix, and, though I was no friend to\nimages, and despised that imitative and grimacing art of which it was a\nrude example, some sense of what the thing implied was carried home to my\nintelligence.  The face looked down upon me with a painful and deadly\ncontraction; but the rays of a glory encircled it, and reminded me that\nthe sacrifice was voluntary.  It stood there, crowning the rock, as it\nstill stands on so many highway sides, vainly preaching to passers-by, an\nemblem of sad and noble truths; that pleasure is not an end, but an\naccident; that pain is the choice of the magnanimous; that it is best to\nsuffer all things and do well.  I turned and went down the mountain in\nsilence; and when I looked back for the last time before the wood closed\nabout my path, I saw Olalla still leaning on the crucifix.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TREASURE OF FRANCHARD.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.  BY THE DYING MOUNTEBANK.\n\n\nThey had sent for the doctor from Bourron before six.  About eight some\nvillagers came round for the performance, and were told how matters\nstood.  It seemed a liberty for a mountebank to fall ill like real\npeople, and they made off again in dudgeon.  By ten Madame Tentaillon was\ngravely alarmed, and had sent down the street for Doctor Desprez.\n\nThe Doctor was at work over his manuscripts in one corner of the little\ndining-room, and his wife was asleep over the fire in another, when the\nmessenger arrived.\n\n'Sapristi!' said the Doctor, 'you should have sent for me before.  It was\na case for hurry.'  And he followed the messenger as he was, in his\nslippers and skull-cap.\n\nThe inn was not thirty yards away, but the messenger did not stop there;\nhe went in at one door and out by another into the court, and then led\nthe way by a flight of steps beside the stable, to the loft where the\nmountebank lay sick.  If Doctor Desprez were to live a thousand years, he\nwould never forget his arrival in that room; for not only was the scene\npicturesque, but the moment made a date in his existence.  We reckon our\nlives, I hardly know why, from the date of our first sorry appearance in\nsociety, as if from a first humiliation; for no actor can come upon the\nstage with a worse grace.  Not to go further back, which would be judged\ntoo curious, there are subsequently many moving and decisive accidents in\nthe lives of all, which would make as logical a period as this of birth.\nAnd here, for instance, Doctor Desprez, a man past forty, who had made\nwhat is called a failure in life, and was moreover married, found himself\nat a new point of departure when he opened the door of the loft above\nTentaillon's stable.\n\nIt was a large place, lighted only by a single candle set upon the floor.\nThe mountebank lay on his back upon a pallet; a large man, with a\nQuixotic nose inflamed with drinking.  Madame Tentaillon stooped over\nhim, applying a hot water and mustard embrocation to his feet; and on a\nchair close by sat a little fellow of eleven or twelve, with his feet\ndangling.  These three were the only occupants, except the shadows.  But\nthe shadows were a company in themselves; the extent of the room\nexaggerated them to a gigantic size, and from the low position of the\ncandle the light struck upwards and produced deformed foreshortenings.\nThe mountebank's profile was enlarged upon the wall in caricature, and it\nwas strange to see his nose shorten and lengthen as the flame was blown\nabout by draughts.  As for Madame Tentaillon, her shadow was no more than\na gross hump of shoulders, with now and again a hemisphere of head.  The\nchair legs were spindled out as long as stilts, and the boy set perched\natop of them, like a cloud, in the corner of the roof.\n\nIt was the boy who took the Doctor's fancy.  He had a great arched skull,\nthe forehead and the hands of a musician, and a pair of haunting eyes.  It\nwas not merely that these eyes were large, or steady, or the softest\nruddy brown.  There was a look in them, besides, which thrilled the\nDoctor, and made him half uneasy.  He was sure he had seen such a look\nbefore, and yet he could not remember how or where.  It was as if this\nboy, who was quite a stranger to him, had the eyes of an old friend or an\nold enemy.  And the boy would give him no peace; he seemed profoundly\nindifferent to what was going on, or rather abstracted from it in a\nsuperior contemplation, beating gently with his feet against the bars of\nthe chair, and holding his hands folded on his lap.  But, for all that,\nhis eyes kept following the Doctor about the room with a thoughtful\nfixity of gaze.  Desprez could not tell whether he was fascinating the\nboy, or the boy was fascinating him.  He busied himself over the sick\nman: he put questions, he felt the pulse, he jested, he grew a little hot\nand swore: and still, whenever he looked round, there were the brown eyes\nwaiting for his with the same inquiring, melancholy gaze.\n\nAt last the Doctor hit on the solution at a leap.  He remembered the look\nnow.  The little fellow, although he was as straight as a dart, had the\neyes that go usually with a crooked back; he was not at all deformed, and\nyet a deformed person seemed to be looking at you from below his brows.\nThe Doctor drew a long breath, he was so much relieved to find a theory\n(for he loved theories) and to explain away his interest.\n\nFor all that, he despatched the invalid with unusual haste, and, still\nkneeling with one knee on the floor, turned a little round and looked the\nboy over at his leisure.  The boy was not in the least put out, but\nlooked placidly back at the Doctor.\n\n'Is this your father?' asked Desprez.\n\n'Oh, no,' returned the boy; 'my master.'\n\n'Are you fond of him?' continued the Doctor.\n\n'No, sir,' said the boy.\n\nMadame Tentaillon and Desprez exchanged expressive glances.\n\n'That is bad, my man,' resumed the latter, with a shade of sternness.\n'Every one should be fond of the dying, or conceal their sentiments; and\nyour master here is dying.  If I have watched a bird a little while\nstealing my cherries, I have a thought of disappointment when he flies\naway over my garden wall, and I see him steer for the forest and vanish.\nHow much more a creature such as this, so strong, so astute, so richly\nendowed with faculties!  When I think that, in a few hours, the speech\nwill be silenced, the breath extinct, and even the shadow vanished from\nthe wall, I who never saw him, this lady who knew him only as a guest,\nare touched with some affection.'\n\nThe boy was silent for a little, and appeared to be reflecting.\n\n'You did not know him,' he replied at last, 'he was a bad man.'\n\n'He is a little pagan,' said the landlady.  'For that matter, they are\nall the same, these mountebanks, tumblers, artists, and what not.  They\nhave no interior.'\n\nBut the Doctor was still scrutinising the little pagan, his eyebrows\nknotted and uplifted.\n\n'What is your name?' he asked.\n\n'Jean-Marie,' said the lad.\n\nDesprez leaped upon him with one of his sudden flashes of excitement, and\nfelt his head all over from an ethnological point of view.\n\n'Celtic, Celtic!' he said.\n\n'Celtic!' cried Madame Tentaillon, who had perhaps confounded the word\nwith hydrocephalous.  'Poor lad! is it dangerous?'\n\n'That depends,' returned the Doctor grimly.  And then once more\naddressing the boy: 'And what do you do for your living, Jean-Marie?' he\ninquired.\n\n'I tumble,' was the answer.\n\n'So!  Tumble?' repeated Desprez.  'Probably healthful.  I hazard the\nguess, Madame Tentaillon, that tumbling is a healthful way of life.  And\nhave you never done anything else but tumble?'\n\n'Before I learned that, I used to steal,' answered Jean-Marie gravely.\n\n'Upon my word!' cried the doctor.  'You are a nice little man for your\nage.  Madame, when my _confrere_ comes from Bourron, you will communicate\nmy unfavourable opinion.  I leave the case in his hands; but of course,\non any alarming symptom, above all if there should be a sign of rally, do\nnot hesitate to knock me up.  I am a doctor no longer, I thank God; but I\nhave been one.  Good night, madame.  Good sleep to you, Jean-Marie.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  MORNING TALK\n\n\nDoctor Desprez always rose early.  Before the smoke arose, before the\nfirst cart rattled over the bridge to the day's labour in the fields, he\nwas to be found wandering in his garden.  Now he would pick a bunch of\ngrapes; now he would eat a big pear under the trellice; now he would draw\nall sorts of fancies on the path with the end of his cane; now he would\ngo down and watch the river running endlessly past the timber landing-\nplace at which he moored his boat.  There was no time, he used to say,\nfor making theories like the early morning.  'I rise earlier than any one\nelse in the village,' he once boasted.  'It is a fair consequence that I\nknow more and wish to do less with my knowledge.'\n\nThe Doctor was a connoisseur of sunrises, and loved a good theatrical\neffect to usher in the day.  He had a theory of dew, by which he could\npredict the weather.  Indeed, most things served him to that end: the\nsound of the bells from all the neighbouring villages, the smell of the\nforest, the visits and the behaviour of both birds and fishes, the look\nof the plants in his garden, the disposition of cloud, the colour of the\nlight, and last, although not least, the arsenal of meteorological\ninstruments in a louvre-boarded hutch upon the lawn.  Ever since he had\nsettled at Gretz, he had been growing more and more into the local\nmeteorologist, the unpaid champion of the local climate.  He thought at\nfirst there was no place so healthful in the arrondissement.  By the end\nof the second year, he protested there was none so wholesome in the whole\ndepartment.  And for some time before he met Jean-Marie he had been\nprepared to challenge all France and the better part of Europe for a\nrival to his chosen spot.\n\n'Doctor,' he would say--'doctor is a foul word.  It should not be used to\nladies.  It implies disease.  I remark it, as a flaw in our civilisation,\nthat we have not the proper horror of disease.  Now I, for my part, have\nwashed my hands of it; I have renounced my laureation; I am no doctor; I\nam only a worshipper of the true goddess Hygieia.  Ah, believe me, it is\nshe who has the cestus!  And here, in this exiguous hamlet, has she\nplaced her shrine: here she dwells and lavishes her gifts; here I walk\nwith her in the early morning, and she shows me how strong she has made\nthe peasants, how fruitful she has made the fields, how the trees grow up\ntall and comely under her eyes, and the fishes in the river become clean\nand agile at her presence.--Rheumatism!' he would cry, on some malapert\ninterruption, 'O, yes, I believe we do have a little rheumatism.  That\ncould hardly be avoided, you know, on a river.  And of course the place\nstands a little low; and the meadows are marshy, there's no doubt.  But,\nmy dear sir, look at Bourron!  Bourron stands high.  Bourron is close to\nthe forest; plenty of ozone there, you would say.  Well, compared with\nGretz, Bourron is a perfect shambles.'\n\nThe morning after he had been summoned to the dying mountebank, the\nDoctor visited the wharf at the tail of his garden, and had a long look\nat the running water.  This he called prayer; but whether his adorations\nwere addressed to the goddess Hygieia or some more orthodox deity, never\nplainly appeared.  For he had uttered doubtful oracles, sometimes\ndeclaring that a river was the type of bodily health, sometimes extolling\nit as the great moral preacher, continually preaching peace, continuity,\nand diligence to man's tormented spirits.  After he had watched a mile or\nso of the clear water running by before his eyes, seen a fish or two come\nto the surface with a gleam of silver, and sufficiently admired the long\nshadows of the trees falling half across the river from the opposite\nbank, with patches of moving sunlight in between, he strolled once more\nup the garden and through his house into the street, feeling cool and\nrenovated.\n\nThe sound of his feet upon the causeway began the business of the day;\nfor the village was still sound asleep.  The church tower looked very\nairy in the sunlight; a few birds that turned about it, seemed to swim in\nan atmosphere of more than usual rarity; and the Doctor, walking in long\ntransparent shadows, filled his lungs amply, and proclaimed himself well\ncontented with the morning.\n\nOn one of the posts before Tentaillon's carriage entry he espied a little\ndark figure perched in a meditative attitude, and immediately recognised\nJean-Marie.\n\n'Aha!' he said, stopping before him humorously, with a hand on either\nknee.  'So we rise early in the morning, do we?  It appears to me that we\nhave all the vices of a philosopher.'\n\nThe boy got to his feet and made a grave salutation.\n\n'And how is our patient?' asked Desprez.\n\nIt appeared the patient was about the same.\n\n'And why do you rise early in the morning?' he pursued.\n\nJean-Marie, after a long silence, professed that he hardly knew.\n\n'You hardly know?' repeated Desprez.  'We hardly know anything, my man,\nuntil we try to learn.  Interrogate your consciousness.  Come, push me\nthis inquiry home.  Do you like it?'\n\n'Yes,' said the boy slowly; 'yes, I like it.'\n\n'And why do you like it?' continued the Doctor.  '(We are now pursuing\nthe Socratic method.)  Why do you like it?'\n\n'It is quiet,' answered Jean-Marie; 'and I have nothing to do; and then I\nfeel as if I were good.'\n\nDoctor Desprez took a seat on the post at the opposite side.  He was\nbeginning to take an interest in the talk, for the boy plainly thought\nbefore he spoke, and tried to answer truly.  'It appears you have a taste\nfor feeling good,' said the Doctor.  'Now, there you puzzle me extremely;\nfor I thought you said you were a thief; and the two are incompatible.'\n\n'Is it very bad to steal?' asked Jean-Marie.\n\n'Such is the general opinion, little boy,' replied the Doctor.\n\n'No; but I mean as I stole,' explained the other.  'For I had no choice.\nI think it is surely right to have bread; it must be right to have bread,\nthere comes so plain a want of it.  And then they beat me cruelly if I\nreturned with nothing,' he added.  'I was not ignorant of right and\nwrong; for before that I had been well taught by a priest, who was very\nkind to me.'  (The Doctor made a horrible grimace at the word 'priest.')\n'But it seemed to me, when one had nothing to eat and was beaten, it was\na different affair.  I would not have stolen for tartlets, I believe; but\nany one would steal for baker's bread.'\n\n'And so I suppose,' said the Doctor, with a rising sneer, 'you prayed God\nto forgive you, and explained the case to Him at length.'\n\n'Why, sir?' asked Jean-Marie.  'I do not see.'\n\n'Your priest would see, however,' retorted Desprez.\n\n'Would he?' asked the boy, troubled for the first time.  'I should have\nthought God would have known.'\n\n'Eh?' snarled the Doctor.\n\n'I should have thought God would have understood me,' replied the other.\n'You do not, I see; but then it was God that made me think so, was it\nnot?'\n\n'Little boy, little boy,' said Dr. Desprez, 'I told you already you had\nthe vices of philosophy; if you display the virtues also, I must go.  I\nam a student of the blessed laws of health, an observer of plain and\ntemperate nature in her common walks; and I cannot preserve my equanimity\nin presence of a monster.  Do you understand?'\n\n'No, sir,' said the boy.\n\n'I will make my meaning clear to you,' replied the doctor.  'Look there\nat the sky--behind the belfry first, where it is so light, and then up\nand up, turning your chin back, right to the top of the dome, where it is\nalready as blue as at noon.  Is not that a beautiful colour?  Does it not\nplease the heart?  We have seen it all our lives, until it has grown in\nwith our familiar thoughts.  Now,' changing his tone, 'suppose that sky\nto become suddenly of a live and fiery amber, like the colour of clear\ncoals, and growing scarlet towards the top--I do not say it would be any\nthe less beautiful; but would you like it as well?'\n\n'I suppose not,' answered Jean-Marie.\n\n'Neither do I like you,' returned the Doctor, roughly.  'I hate all odd\npeople, and you are the most curious little boy in all the world.'\n\nJean-Marie seemed to ponder for a while, and then he raised his head\nagain and looked over at the Doctor with an air of candid inquiry.  'But\nare not you a very curious gentleman?' he asked.\n\nThe Doctor threw away his stick, bounded on the boy, clasped him to his\nbosom, and kissed him on both cheeks.  'Admirable, admirable imp!' he\ncried.  'What a morning, what an hour for a theorist of forty-two!  No,'\nhe continued, apostrophising heaven, 'I did not know such boys existed; I\nwas ignorant they made them so; I had doubted of my race; and now!  It is\nlike,' he added, picking up his stick, 'like a lovers' meeting.  I have\nbruised my favourite staff in that moment of enthusiasm.  The injury,\nhowever, is not grave.'  He caught the boy looking at him in obvious\nwonder, embarrassment, and alarm.  'Hullo!' said he, 'why do you look at\nme like that?  Egad, I believe the boy despises me.  Do you despise me,\nboy?'\n\n'O, no,' replied Jean-Marie, seriously; 'only I do not understand.'\n\n'You must excuse me, sir,' returned the Doctor, with gravity; 'I am still\nso young.  O, hang him!' he added to himself.  And he took his seat again\nand observed the boy sardonically.  'He has spoiled the quiet of my\nmorning,' thought he.  'I shall be nervous all day, and have a febricule\nwhen I digest.  Let me compose myself.'  And so he dismissed his\npre-occupations by an effort of the will which he had long practised, and\nlet his soul roam abroad in the contemplation of the morning.  He inhaled\nthe air, tasting it critically as a connoisseur tastes a vintage, and\nprolonging the expiration with hygienic gusto.  He counted the little\nflecks of cloud along the sky.  He followed the movements of the birds\nround the church tower--making long sweeps, hanging poised, or turning\nairy somersaults in fancy, and beating the wind with imaginary pinions.\nAnd in this way he regained peace of mind and animal composure, conscious\nof his limbs, conscious of the sight of his eyes, conscious that the air\nhad a cool taste, like a fruit, at the top of his throat; and at last, in\ncomplete abstraction, he began to sing.  The Doctor had but one air--,\n'Malbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre;' even with that he was on terms of mere\npoliteness; and his musical exploits were always reserved for moments\nwhen he was alone and entirely happy.\n\nHe was recalled to earth rudely by a pained expression on the boy's face.\n'What do you think of my singing?' he inquired, stopping in the middle of\na note; and then, after he had waited some little while and received no\nanswer, 'What do you think of my singing?' he repeated, imperiously.\n\n'I do not like it,' faltered Jean-Marie.\n\n'Oh, come!' cried the Doctor.  'Possibly you are a performer yourself?'\n\n'I sing better than that,' replied the boy.\n\nThe Doctor eyed him for some seconds in stupefaction.  He was aware that\nhe was angry, and blushed for himself in consequence, which made him\nangrier.  'If this is how you address your master!' he said at last, with\na shrug and a flourish of his arms.\n\n'I do not speak to him at all,' returned the boy.  'I do not like him.'\n\n'Then you like me?' snapped Doctor Desprez, with unusual eagerness.\n\n'I do not know,' answered Jean-Marie.\n\nThe Doctor rose.  'I shall wish you a good morning,' he said.  'You are\ntoo much for me.  Perhaps you have blood in your veins, perhaps celestial\nichor, or perhaps you circulate nothing more gross than respirable air;\nbut of one thing I am inexpugnably assured:--that you are no human being.\nNo, boy'--shaking his stick at him--'you are not a human being.  Write,\nwrite it in your memory--\"I am not a human being--I have no pretension to\nbe a human being--I am a dive, a dream, an angel, an acrostic, an\nillusion--what you please, but not a human being.\"  And so accept my\nhumble salutations and farewell!'\n\nAnd with that the Doctor made off along the street in some emotion, and\nthe boy stood, mentally gaping, where he left him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  THE ADOPTION.\n\n\nMadame Desprez, who answered to the Christian name of Anastasie,\npresented an agreeable type of her sex; exceedingly wholesome to look\nupon, a stout _brune_, with cool smooth cheeks, steady, dark eyes, and\nhands that neither art nor nature could improve.  She was the sort of\nperson over whom adversity passes like a summer cloud; she might, in the\nworst of conjunctions, knit her brows into one vertical furrow for a\nmoment, but the next it would be gone.  She had much of the placidity of\na contented nun; with little of her piety, however; for Anastasie was of\na very mundane nature, fond of oysters and old wine, and somewhat bold\npleasantries, and devoted to her husband for her own sake rather than for\nhis.  She was imperturbably good-natured, but had no idea of\nself-sacrifice.  To live in that pleasant old house, with a green garden\nbehind and bright flowers about the window, to eat and drink of the best,\nto gossip with a neighbour for a quarter of an hour, never to wear stays\nor a dress except when she went to Fontainebleau shopping, to be kept in\na continual supply of racy novels, and to be married to Doctor Desprez\nand have no ground of jealousy, filled the cup of her nature to the brim.\nThose who had known the Doctor in bachelor days, when he had aired quite\nas many theories, but of a different order, attributed his present\nphilosophy to the study of Anastasie.  It was her brute enjoyment that he\nrationalised and perhaps vainly imitated.\n\nMadame Desprez was an artist in the kitchen, and made coffee to a nicety.\nShe had a knack of tidiness, with which she had infected the Doctor;\neverything was in its place; everything capable of polish shone\ngloriously; and dust was a thing banished from her empire.  Aline, their\nsingle servant, had no other business in the world but to scour and\nburnish.  So Doctor Desprez lived in his house like a fatted calf, warmed\nand cosseted to his heart's content.\n\nThe midday meal was excellent.  There was a ripe melon, a fish from the\nriver in a memorable Bearnaise sauce, a fat fowl in a fricassee, and a\ndish of asparagus, followed by some fruit.  The Doctor drank half a\nbottle _plus_ one glass, the wife half a bottle _minus_ the same\nquantity, which was a marital privilege, of an excellent Cote-Rotie,\nseven years old.  Then the coffee was brought, and a flask of Chartreuse\nfor madame, for the Doctor despised and distrusted such decoctions; and\nthen Aline left the wedded pair to the pleasures of memory and digestion.\n\n'It is a very fortunate circumstance, my cherished one,' observed the\nDoctor--'this coffee is adorable--a very fortunate circumstance upon the\nwhole--Anastasie, I beseech you, go without that poison for to-day; only\none day, and you will feel the benefit, I pledge my reputation.'\n\n'What is this fortunate circumstance, my friend?' inquired Anastasie, not\nheeding his protest, which was of daily recurrence.\n\n'That we have no children, my beautiful,' replied the Doctor.  'I think\nof it more and more as the years go on, and with more and more gratitude\ntowards the Power that dispenses such afflictions.  Your health, my\ndarling, my studious quiet, our little kitchen delicacies, how they would\nall have suffered, how they would all have been sacrificed!  And for\nwhat?  Children are the last word of human imperfection.  Health flees\nbefore their face.  They cry, my dear; they put vexatious questions; they\ndemand to be fed, to be washed, to be educated, to have their noses\nblown; and then, when the time comes, they break our hearts, as I break\nthis piece of sugar.  A pair of professed egoists, like you and me,\nshould avoid offspring, like an infidelity.'\n\n'Indeed!' said she; and she laughed.  'Now, that is like you--to take\ncredit for the thing you could not help.'\n\n'My dear,' returned the Doctor, solemnly, 'we might have adopted.'\n\n'Never!' cried madame.  'Never, Doctor, with my consent.  If the child\nwere my own flesh and blood, I would not say no.  But to take another\nperson's indiscretion on my shoulders, my dear friend, I have too much\nsense.'\n\n'Precisely,' replied the Doctor.  'We both had.  And I am all the better\npleased with our wisdom, because--because--'  He looked at her sharply.\n\n'Because what?' she asked, with a faint premonition of danger.\n\n'Because I have found the right person,' said the Doctor firmly, 'and\nshall adopt him this afternoon.'\n\nAnastasie looked at him out of a mist.  'You have lost your reason,' she\nsaid; and there was a clang in her voice that seemed to threaten trouble.\n\n'Not so, my dear,' he replied; 'I retain its complete exercise.  To the\nproof: instead of attempting to cloak my inconsistency, I have, by way of\npreparing you, thrown it into strong relief.  You will there, I think,\nrecognise the philosopher who has the ecstasy to call you wife.  The fact\nis, I have been reckoning all this while without an accident.  I never\nthought to find a son of my own.  Now, last night, I found one.  Do not\nunnecessarily alarm yourself, my dear; he is not a drop of blood to me\nthat I know.  It is his mind, darling, his mind that calls me father.'\n\n'His mind!' she repeated with a titter between scorn and hysterics.  'His\nmind, indeed!  Henri, is this an idiotic pleasantry, or are you mad?  His\nmind!  And what of my mind?'\n\n'Truly,' replied the Doctor with a shrug, 'you have your finger on the\nhitch.  He will be strikingly antipathetic to my ever beautiful\nAnastasie.  She will never understand him; he will never understand her.\nYou married the animal side of my nature, dear and it is on the spiritual\nside that I find my affinity for Jean-Marie.  So much so, that, to be\nperfectly frank, I stand in some awe of him myself.  You will easily\nperceive that I am announcing a calamity for you.  Do not,' he broke out\nin tones of real solicitude--'do not give way to tears after a meal,\nAnastasie.  You will certainly give yourself a false digestion.'\n\nAnastasie controlled herself.  'You know how willing I am to humour you,'\nshe said, 'in all reasonable matters.  But on this point--'\n\n'My dear love,' interrupted the Doctor, eager to prevent a refusal, 'who\nwished to leave Paris?  Who made me give up cards, and the opera, and the\nboulevard, and my social relations, and all that was my life before I\nknew you?  Have I been faithful?  Have I been obedient?  Have I not borne\nmy doom with cheerfulness?  In all honesty, Anastasie, have I not a right\nto a stipulation on my side?  I have, and you know it.  I stipulate my\nson.'\n\nAnastasie was aware of defeat; she struck her colours instantly.  'You\nwill break my heart,' she sighed.\n\n'Not in the least,' said he.  'You will feel a trifling inconvenience for\na month, just as I did when I was first brought to this vile hamlet; then\nyour admirable sense and temper will prevail, and I see you already as\ncontent as ever, and making your husband the happiest of men.'\n\n'You know I can refuse you nothing,' she said, with a last flicker of\nresistance; 'nothing that will make you truly happier.  But will this?\nAre you sure, my husband?  Last night, you say, you found him!  He may be\nthe worst of humbugs.'\n\n'I think not,' replied the Doctor.  'But do not suppose me so unwary as\nto adopt him out of hand.  I am, I flatter myself, a finished man of the\nworld; I have had all possibilities in view; my plan is contrived to meet\nthem all.  I take the lad as stable boy.  If he pilfer, if he grumble, if\nhe desire to change, I shall see I was mistaken; I shall recognise him\nfor no son of mine, and send him tramping.'\n\n'You will never do so when the time comes,' said his wife; 'I know your\ngood heart.'\n\nShe reached out her hand to him, with a sigh; the Doctor smiled as he\ntook it and carried it to his lips; he had gained his point with greater\nease than he had dared to hope; for perhaps the twentieth time he had\nproved the efficacy of his trusty argument, his Excalibur, the hint of a\nreturn to Paris.  Six months in the capital, for a man of the Doctor's\nantecedents and relations, implied no less a calamity than total ruin.\nAnastasie had saved the remainder of his fortune by keeping him strictly\nin the country.  The very name of Paris put her in a blue fear; and she\nwould have allowed her husband to keep a menagerie in the back garden,\nlet alone adopting a stable-boy, rather than permit the question of\nreturn to be discussed.\n\nAbout four of the afternoon, the mountebank rendered up his ghost; he had\nnever been conscious since his seizure.  Doctor Desprez was present at\nhis last passage, and declared the farce over.  Then he took Jean-Marie\nby the shoulder and led him out into the inn garden where there was a\nconvenient bench beside the river.  Here he sat him down and made the boy\nplace himself on his left.\n\n'Jean-Marie,' he said very gravely, 'this world is exceedingly vast; and\neven France, which is only a small corner of it, is a great place for a\nlittle lad like you.  Unfortunately it is full of eager, shouldering\npeople moving on; and there are very few bakers' shops for so many\neaters.  Your master is dead; you are not fit to gain a living by\nyourself; you do not wish to steal?  No.  Your situation then is\nundesirable; it is, for the moment, critical.  On the other hand, you\nbehold in me a man not old, though elderly, still enjoying the youth of\nthe heart and the intelligence; a man of instruction; easily situated in\nthis world's affairs; keeping a good table:--a man, neither as friend nor\nhost, to be despised.  I offer you your food and clothes, and to teach\nyou lessons in the evening, which will be infinitely more to the purpose\nfor a lad of your stamp than those of all the priests in Europe.  I\npropose no wages, but if ever you take a thought to leave me, the door\nshall be open, and I will give you a hundred francs to start the world\nupon.  In return, I have an old horse and chaise, which you would very\nspeedily learn to clean and keep in order.  Do not hurry yourself to\nanswer, and take it or leave it as you judge aright.  Only remember this,\nthat I am no sentimentalist or charitable person, but a man who lives\nrigorously to himself; and that if I make the proposal, it is for my own\nends--it is because I perceive clearly an advantage to myself.  And now,\nreflect.'\n\n'I shall be very glad.  I do not see what else I can do.  I thank you,\nsir, most kindly, and I will try to be useful,' said the boy.\n\n'Thank you,' said the Doctor warmly, rising at the same time and wiping\nhis brow, for he had suffered agonies while the thing hung in the wind.  A\nrefusal, after the scene at noon, would have placed him in a ridiculous\nlight before Anastasie.  'How hot and heavy is the evening, to be sure!  I\nhave always had a fancy to be a fish in summer, Jean-Marie, here in the\nLoing beside Gretz.  I should lie under a water-lily and listen to the\nbells, which must sound most delicately down below.  That would be a\nlife--do you not think so too?'\n\n'Yes,' said Jean-Marie.\n\n'Thank God you have imagination!' cried the Doctor, embracing the boy\nwith his usual effusive warmth, though it was a proceeding that seemed to\ndisconcert the sufferer almost as much as if he had been an English\nschoolboy of the same age.  'And now,' he added, 'I will take you to my\nwife.'\n\nMadame Desprez sat in the dining-room in a cool wrapper.  All the blinds\nwere down, and the tile floor had been recently sprinkled with water; her\neyes were half shut, but she affected to be reading a novel as the they\nentered.  Though she was a bustling woman, she enjoyed repose between\nwhiles and had a remarkable appetite for sleep.\n\nThe Doctor went through a solemn form of introduction, adding, for the\nbenefit of both parties, 'You must try to like each other for my sake.'\n\n'He is very pretty,' said Anastasie.  'Will you kiss me, my pretty little\nfellow?'\n\nThe Doctor was furious, and dragged her into the passage.  'Are you a\nfool, Anastasie?' he said.  'What is all this I hear about the tact of\nwomen?  Heaven knows, I have not met with it in my experience.  You\naddress my little philosopher as if he were an infant.  He must be spoken\nto with more respect, I tell you; he must not be kissed and\nGeorgy-porgy'd like an ordinary child.'\n\n'I only did it to please you, I am sure,' replied Anastasie; 'but I will\ntry to do better.'\n\nThe Doctor apologised for his warmth.  'But I do wish him,' he continued,\n'to feel at home among us.  And really your conduct was so idiotic, my\ncherished one, and so utterly and distantly out of place, that a saint\nmight have been pardoned a little vehemence in disapproval.  Do, do\ntry--if it is possible for a woman to understand young people--but of\ncourse it is not, and I waste my breath.  Hold your tongue as much as\npossible at least, and observe my conduct narrowly; it will serve you for\na model.'\n\nAnastasie did as she was bidden, and considered the Doctor's behaviour.\nShe observed that he embraced the boy three times in the course of the\nevening, and managed generally to confound and abash the little fellow\nout of speech and appetite.  But she had the true womanly heroism in\nlittle affairs.  Not only did she refrain from the cheap revenge of\nexposing the Doctor's errors to himself, but she did her best to remove\ntheir ill-effect on Jean-Marie.  When Desprez went out for his last\nbreath of air before retiring for the night, she came over to the boy's\nside and took his hand.\n\n'You must not be surprised nor frightened by my husband's manners,' she\nsaid.  'He is the kindest of men, but so clever that he is sometimes\ndifficult to understand.  You will soon grow used to him, and then you\nwill love him, for that nobody can help.  As for me, you may be sure, I\nshall try to make you happy, and will not bother you at all.  I think we\nshould be excellent friends, you and I.  I am not clever, but I am very\ngood-natured.  Will you give me a kiss?'\n\nHe held up his face, and she took him in her arms and then began to cry.\nThe woman had spoken in complaisance; but she had warmed to her own\nwords, and tenderness followed.  The Doctor, entering, found them\nenlaced: he concluded that his wife was in fault; and he was just\nbeginning, in an awful voice, 'Anastasie--,' when she looked up at him,\nsmiling, with an upraised finger; and he held his peace, wondering, while\nshe led the boy to his attic.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  THE EDUCATION OF A PHILOSOPHER.\n\n\nThe installation of the adopted stable-boy was thus happily effected, and\nthe wheels of life continued to run smoothly in the Doctor's house.  Jean-\nMarie did his horse and carriage duty in the morning; sometimes helped in\nthe housework; sometimes walked abroad with the Doctor, to drink wisdom\nfrom the fountain-head; and was introduced at night to the sciences and\nthe dead tongues.  He retained his singular placidity of mind and manner;\nhe was rarely in fault; but he made only a very partial progress in his\nstudies, and remained much of a stranger in the family.\n\nThe Doctor was a pattern of regularity.  All forenoon he worked on his\ngreat book, the 'Comparative Pharmacopoeia, or Historical Dictionary of\nall Medicines,' which as yet consisted principally of slips of paper and\npins.  When finished, it was to fill many personable volumes, and to\ncombine antiquarian interest with professional utility.  But the Doctor\nwas studious of literary graces and the picturesque; an anecdote, a touch\nof manners, a moral qualification, or a sounding epithet was sure to be\npreferred before a piece of science; a little more, and he would have\nwritten the 'Comparative Pharmacopoeia' in verse!  The article 'Mummia,'\nfor instance, was already complete, though the remainder of the work had\nnot progressed beyond the letter A.  It was exceedingly copious and\nentertaining, written with quaintness and colour, exact, erudite, a\nliterary article; but it would hardly have afforded guidance to a\npractising physician of to-day.  The feminine good sense of his wife had\nled her to point this out with uncompromising sincerity; for the\nDictionary was duly read aloud to her, betwixt sleep and waning, as it\nproceeded towards an infinitely distant completion; and the Doctor was a\nlittle sore on the subject of mummies, and sometimes resented an allusion\nwith asperity.\n\nAfter the midday meal and a proper period of digestion, he walked,\nsometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by Jean-Marie; for madame would\nhave preferred any hardship rather than walk.\n\nShe was, as I have said, a very busy person, continually occupied about\nmaterial comforts, and ready to drop asleep over a novel the instant she\nwas disengaged.  This was the less objectionable, as she never snored or\ngrew distempered in complexion when she slept.  On the contrary, she\nlooked the very picture of luxurious and appetising ease, and woke\nwithout a start to the perfect possession of her faculties.  I am afraid\nshe was greatly an animal, but she was a very nice animal to have about.\nIn this way, she had little to do with Jean-Marie; but the sympathy which\nhad been established between them on the first night remained unbroken;\nthey held occasional conversations, mostly on household matters; to the\nextreme disappointment of the Doctor, they occasionally sallied off\ntogether to that temple of debasing superstition, the village church;\nmadame and he, both in their Sunday's best, drove twice a month to\nFontainebleau and returned laden with purchases; and in short, although\nthe Doctor still continued to regard them as irreconcilably\nanti-pathetic, their relation was as intimate, friendly, and confidential\nas their natures suffered.\n\nI fear, however, that in her heart of hearts, madame kindly despised and\npitied the boy.  She had no admiration for his class of virtues; she\nliked a smart, polite, forward, roguish sort of boy, cap in hand, light\nof foot, meeting the eye; she liked volubility, charm, a little vice--the\npromise of a second Doctor Desprez.  And it was her indefeasible belief\nthat Jean-Marie was dull.  'Poor dear boy,' she had said once, 'how sad\nit is that he should be so stupid!'  She had never repeated that remark,\nfor the Doctor had raged like a wild bull, denouncing the brutal\nbluntness of her mind, bemoaning his own fate to be so unequally mated\nwith an ass, and, what touched Anastasie more nearly, menacing the table\nchina by the fury of his gesticulations.  But she adhered silently to her\nopinion; and when Jean-Marie was sitting, stolid, blank, but not unhappy,\nover his unfinished tasks, she would snatch her opportunity in the\nDoctor's absence, go over to him, put her arms about his neck, lay her\ncheek to his, and communicate her sympathy with his distress.  'Do not\nmind,' she would say; 'I, too, am not at all clever, and I can assure you\nthat it makes no difference in life.'\n\nThe Doctor's view was naturally different.  That gentleman never wearied\nof the sound of his own voice, which was, to say the truth, agreeable\nenough to hear.  He now had a listener, who was not so cynically\nindifferent as Anastasie, and who sometimes put him on his mettle by the\nmost relevant objections.  Besides, was he not educating the boy?  And\neducation, philosophers are agreed, is the most philosophical of duties.\nWhat can be more heavenly to poor mankind than to have one's hobby grow\ninto a duty to the State?  Then, indeed, do the ways of life become ways\nof pleasantness.  Never had the Doctor seen reason to be more content\nwith his endowments.  Philosophy flowed smoothly from his lips.  He was\nso agile a dialectician that he could trace his nonsense, when\nchallenged, back to some root in sense, and prove it to be a sort of\nflower upon his system.  He slipped out of antinomies like a fish, and\nleft his disciple marvelling at the rabbi's depth.\n\nMoreover, deep down in his heart the Doctor was disappointed with the ill-\nsuccess of his more formal education.  A boy, chosen by so acute an\nobserver for his aptitude, and guided along the path of learning by so\nphilosophic an instructor, was bound, by the nature of the universe, to\nmake a more obvious and lasting advance.  Now Jean-Marie was slow in all\nthings, impenetrable in others; and his power of forgetting was fully on\na level with his power to learn.  Therefore the Doctor cherished his\nperipatetic lectures, to which the boy attended, which he generally\nappeared to enjoy, and by which he often profited.\n\nMany and many were the talks they had together; and health and moderation\nproved the subject of the Doctor's divagations.  To these he lovingly\nreturned.\n\n'I lead you,' he would say, 'by the green pastures.  My system, my\nbeliefs, my medicines, are resumed in one phrase--to avoid excess.\nBlessed nature, healthy, temperate nature, abhors and exterminates\nexcess.  Human law, in this matter, imitates at a great distance her\nprovisions; and we must strive to supplement the efforts of the law.  Yes,\nboy, we must be a law to ourselves and for ourselves and for our\nneighbours--lex armata--armed, emphatic, tyrannous law.  If you see a\ncrapulous human ruin snuffing, dash from him his box!  The judge, though\nin a way an admission of disease, is less offensive to me than either the\ndoctor or the priest.  Above all the doctor--the doctor and the purulent\ntrash and garbage of his pharmacopoeia!  Pure air--from the neighbourhood\nof a pinetum for the sake of the turpentine--unadulterated wine, and the\nreflections of an unsophisticated spirit in the presence of the works of\nnature--these, my boy, are the best medical appliances and the best\nreligious comforts.  Devote yourself to these.  Hark! there are the bells\nof Bourron (the wind is in the north, it will be fair).  How clear and\nairy is the sound!  The nerves are harmonised and quieted; the mind\nattuned to silence; and observe how easily and regularly beats the heart!\nYour unenlightened doctor would see nothing in these sensations; and yet\nyou yourself perceive they are a part of health.--Did you remember your\ncinchona this morning?  Good.  Cinchona also is a work of nature; it is,\nafter all, only the bark of a tree which we might gather for ourselves if\nwe lived in the locality.--What a world is this!  Though a professed\natheist, I delight to bear my testimony to the world.  Look at the\ngratuitous remedies and pleasures that surround our path!  The river runs\nby the garden end, our bath, our fishpond, our natural system of\ndrainage.  There is a well in the court which sends up sparkling water\nfrom the earth's very heart, clean, cool, and, with a little wine, most\nwholesome.  The district is notorious for its salubrity; rheumatism is\nthe only prevalent complaint, and I myself have never had a touch of it.\nI tell you--and my opinion is based upon the coldest, clearest processes\nof reason--if I, if you, desired to leave this home of pleasures, it\nwould be the duty, it would be the privilege, of our best friend to\nprevent us with a pistol bullet.'\n\nOne beautiful June day they sat upon the hill outside the village.  The\nriver, as blue as heaven, shone here and there among the foliage.  The\nindefatigable birds turned and flickered about Gretz church tower.  A\nhealthy wind blew from over the forest, and the sound of innumerable\nthousands of tree-tops and innumerable millions on millions of green\nleaves was abroad in the air, and filled the ear with something between\nwhispered speech and singing.  It seemed as if every blade of grass must\nhide a cigale; and the fields rang merrily with their music, jingling far\nand near as with the sleigh-bells of the fairy queen.  From their station\non the slope the eye embraced a large space of poplar'd plain upon the\none hand, the waving hill-tops of the forest on the other, and Gretz\nitself in the middle, a handful of roofs.  Under the bestriding arch of\nthe blue heavens, the place seemed dwindled to a toy.  It seemed\nincredible that people dwelt, and could find room to turn or air to\nbreathe, in such a corner of the world.  The thought came home to the\nboy, perhaps for the first time, and he gave it words.\n\n'How small it looks!' he sighed.\n\n'Ay,' replied the Doctor, 'small enough now.  Yet it was once a walled\ncity; thriving, full of furred burgesses and men in armour, humming with\naffairs;--with tall spires, for aught that I know, and portly towers\nalong the battlements.  A thousand chimneys ceased smoking at the curfew\nbell.  There were gibbets at the gate as thick as scarecrows.  In time of\nwar, the assault swarmed against it with ladders, the arrows fell like\nleaves, the defenders sallied hotly over the drawbridge, each side\nuttered its cry as they plied their weapons.  Do you know that the walls\nextended as far as the Commanderie?  Tradition so reports.  Alas, what a\nlong way off is all this confusion--nothing left of it but my quiet words\nspoken in your ear--and the town itself shrunk to the hamlet underneath\nus!  By-and-by came the English wars--you shall hear more of the English,\na stupid people, who sometimes blundered into good--and Gretz was taken,\nsacked, and burned.  It is the history of many towns; but Gretz never\nrose again; it was never rebuilt; its ruins were a quarry to serve the\ngrowth of rivals; and the stones of Gretz are now erect along the streets\nof Nemours.  It gratifies me that our old house was the first to rise\nafter the calamity; when the town had come to an end, it inaugurated the\nhamlet.'\n\n'I, too, am glad of that,' said Jean-Marie.\n\n'It should be the temple of the humbler virtues,' responded the Doctor\nwith a savoury gusto.  'Perhaps one of the reasons why I love my little\nhamlet as I do, is that we have a similar history, she and I.  Have I\ntold you that I was once rich?'\n\n'I do not think so,' answered Jean-Marie.  'I do not think I should have\nforgotten.  I am sorry you should have lost your fortune.'\n\n'Sorry?' cried the Doctor.  'Why, I find I have scarce begun your\neducation after all.  Listen to me!  Would you rather live in the old\nGretz or in the new, free from the alarms of war, with the green country\nat the door, without noise, passports, the exactions of the soldiery, or\nthe jangle of the curfew-bell to send us off to bed by sundown?'\n\n'I suppose I should prefer the new,' replied the boy.\n\n'Precisely,' returned the Doctor; 'so do I.  And, in the same way, I\nprefer my present moderate fortune to my former wealth.  Golden\nmediocrity! cried the adorable ancients; and I subscribe to their\nenthusiasm.  Have I not good wine, good food, good air, the fields and\nthe forest for my walk, a house, an admirable wife, a boy whom I protest\nI cherish like a son?  Now, if I were still rich, I should indubitably\nmake my residence in Paris--you know Paris--Paris and Paradise are not\nconvertible terms.  This pleasant noise of the wind streaming among\nleaves changed into the grinding Babel of the street, the stupid glare of\nplaster substituted for this quiet pattern of greens and greys, the\nnerves shattered, the digestion falsified--picture the fall!  Already you\nperceive the consequences; the mind is stimulated, the heart steps to a\ndifferent measure, and the man is himself no longer.  I have passionately\nstudied myself--the true business of philosophy.  I know my character as\nthe musician knows the ventages of his flute.  Should I return to Paris,\nI should ruin myself gambling; nay, I go further--I should break the\nheart of my Anastasie with infidelities.'\n\nThis was too much for Jean-Marie.  That a place should so transform the\nmost excellent of men transcended his belief.  Paris, he protested, was\neven an agreeable place of residence.  'Nor when I lived in that city did\nI feel much difference,' he pleaded.\n\n'What!' cried the Doctor.  'Did you not steal when you were there?'\n\nBut the boy could never be brought to see that he had done anything wrong\nwhen he stole.  Nor, indeed, did the Doctor think he had; but that\ngentleman was never very scrupulous when in want of a retort.\n\n'And now,' he concluded, 'do you begin to understand?  My only friends\nwere those who ruined me.  Gretz has been my academy, my sanatorium, my\nheaven of innocent pleasures.  If millions are offered me, I wave them\nback: _Retro_, _Sathanas_!--Evil one, begone!  Fix your mind on my\nexample; despise riches, avoid the debasing influence of cities.\nHygiene--hygiene and mediocrity of fortune--these be your watchwords\nduring life!'\n\nThe Doctor's system of hygiene strikingly coincided with his tastes; and\nhis picture of the perfect life was a faithful description of the one he\nwas leading at the time.  But it is easy to convince a boy, whom you\nsupply with all the facts for the discussion.  And besides, there was one\nthing admirable in the philosophy, and that was the enthusiasm of the\nphilosopher.  There was never any one more vigorously determined to be\npleased; and if he was not a great logician, and so had no right to\nconvince the intellect, he was certainly something of a poet, and had a\nfascination to seduce the heart.  What he could not achieve in his\ncustomary humour of a radiant admiration of himself and his\ncircumstances, he sometimes effected in his fits of gloom.\n\n'Boy,' he would say, 'avoid me to-day.  If I were superstitious, I should\neven beg for an interest in your prayers.  I am in the black fit; the\nevil spirit of King Saul, the hag of the merchant Abudah, the personal\ndevil of the mediaeval monk, is with me--is in me,' tapping on his\nbreast.  'The vices of my nature are now uppermost; innocent pleasures\nwoo me in vain; I long for Paris, for my wallowing in the mire.  See,' he\nwould continue, producing a handful of silver, 'I denude myself, I am not\nto be trusted with the price of a fare.  Take it, keep it for me,\nsquander it on deleterious candy, throw it in the deepest of the river--I\nwill homologate your action.  Save me from that part of myself which I\ndisown.  If you see me falter, do not hesitate; if necessary, wreck the\ntrain!  I speak, of course, by a parable.  Any extremity were better than\nfor me to reach Paris alive.'\n\nDoubtless the Doctor enjoyed these little scenes, as a variation in his\npart; they represented the Byronic element in the somewhat artificial\npoetry of his existence; but to the boy, though he was dimly aware of\ntheir theatricality, they represented more.  The Doctor made perhaps too\nlittle, the boy possibly too much, of the reality and gravity of these\ntemptations.\n\nOne day a great light shone for Jean-Marie.  'Could not riches be used\nwell?' he asked.\n\n'In theory, yes,' replied the Doctor.  'But it is found in experience\nthat no one does so.  All the world imagine they will be exceptional when\nthey grow wealthy; but possession is debasing, new desires spring up; and\nthe silly taste for ostentation eats out the heart of pleasure.'\n\n'Then you might be better if you had less,' said the boy.\n\n'Certainly not,' replied the Doctor; but his voice quavered as he spoke.\n\n'Why?' demanded pitiless innocence.\n\nDoctor Desprez saw all the colours of the rainbow in a moment; the stable\nuniverse appeared to be about capsizing with him.  'Because,' said\nhe--affecting deliberation after an obvious pause--'because I have formed\nmy life for my present income.  It is not good for men of my years to be\nviolently dissevered from their habits.'\n\nThat was a sharp brush.  The Doctor breathed hard, and fell into\ntaciturnity for the afternoon.  As for the boy, he was delighted with the\nresolution of his doubts; even wondered that he had not foreseen the\nobvious and conclusive answer.  His faith in the Doctor was a stout piece\nof goods.  Desprez was inclined to be a sheet in the wind's eye after\ndinner, especially after Rhone wine, his favourite weakness.  He would\nthen remark on the warmth of his feeling for Anastasie, and with inflamed\ncheeks and a loose, flustered smile, debate upon all sorts of topics, and\nbe feebly and indiscreetly witty.  But the adopted stable-boy would not\npermit himself to entertain a doubt that savoured of ingratitude.  It is\nquite true that a man may be a second father to you, and yet take too\nmuch to drink; but the best natures are ever slow to accept such truths.\n\nThe Doctor thoroughly possessed his heart, but perhaps he exaggerated his\ninfluence over his mind.  Certainly Jean-Marie adopted some of his\nmaster's opinions, but I have yet to learn that he ever surrendered one\nof his own.  Convictions existed in him by divine right; they were\nvirgin, unwrought, the brute metal of decision.  He could add others\nindeed, but he could not put away; neither did he care if they were\nperfectly agreed among themselves; and his spiritual pleasures had\nnothing to do with turning them over or justifying them in words.  Words\nwere with him a mere accomplishment, like dancing.  When he was by\nhimself, his pleasures were almost vegetable.  He would slip into the\nwoods towards Acheres, and sit in the mouth of a cave among grey birches.\nHis soul stared straight out of his eyes; he did not move or think;\nsunlight, thin shadows moving in the wind, the edge of firs against the\nsky, occupied and bound his faculties.  He was pure unity, a spirit\nwholly abstracted.  A single mood filled him, to which all the objects of\nsense contributed, as the colours of the spectrum merge and disappear in\nwhite light.\n\nSo while the Doctor made himself drunk with words, the adopted stable-boy\nbemused himself with silence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  TREASURE TROVE.\n\n\nThe Doctor's carriage was a two-wheeled gig with a hood; a kind of\nvehicle in much favour among country doctors.  On how many roads has one\nnot seen it, a great way off between the poplars!--in how many village\nstreets, tied to a gate-post!  This sort of chariot is\naffected--particularly at the trot--by a kind of pitching movement to and\nfro across the axle, which well entitles it to the style of a Noddy.  The\nhood describes a considerable arc against the landscape, with a solemnly\nabsurd effect on the contemplative pedestrian.  To ride in such a\ncarriage cannot be numbered among the things that appertain to glory; but\nI have no doubt it may be useful in liver complaint.  Thence, perhaps,\nits wide popularity among physicians.\n\nOne morning early, Jean-Marie led forth the Doctor's noddy, opened the\ngate, and mounted to the driving-seat.  The Doctor followed, arrayed from\ntop to toe in spotless linen, armed with an immense flesh-coloured\numbrella, and girt with a botanical case on a baldric; and the equipage\ndrove off smartly in a breeze of its own provocation.  They were bound\nfor Franchard, to collect plants, with an eye to the 'Comparative\nPharmacopoeia.'\n\nA little rattling on the open roads, and they came to the borders of the\nforest and struck into an unfrequented track; the noddy yawed softly over\nthe sand, with an accompaniment of snapping twigs.  There was a great,\ngreen, softly murmuring cloud of congregated foliage overhead.  In the\narcades of the forest the air retained the freshness of the night.  The\nathletic bearing of the trees, each carrying its leafy mountain, pleased\nthe mind like so many statues; and the lines of the trunk led the eye\nadmiringly upward to where the extreme leaves sparkled in a patch of\nazure.  Squirrels leaped in mid air.  It was a proper spot for a devotee\nof the goddess Hygieia.\n\n'Have you been to Franchard, Jean-Marie?' inquired the Doctor.  'I fancy\nnot.'\n\n'Never,' replied the boy.\n\n'It is ruin in a gorge,' continued Desprez, adopting his expository\nvoice; 'the ruin of a hermitage and chapel.  History tells us much of\nFranchard; how the recluse was often slain by robbers; how he lived on a\nmost insufficient diet; how he was expected to pass his days in prayer.  A\nletter is preserved, addressed to one of these solitaries by the superior\nof his order, full of admirable hygienic advice; bidding him go from his\nbook to praying, and so back again, for variety's sake, and when he was\nweary of both to stroll about his garden and observe the honey bees.  It\nis to this day my own system.  You must often have remarked me leaving\nthe \"Pharmacopoeia\"--often even in the middle of a phrase--to come forth\ninto the sun and air.  I admire the writer of that letter from my heart;\nhe was a man of thought on the most important subjects.  But, indeed, had\nI lived in the Middle Ages (I am heartily glad that I did not) I should\nhave been an eremite myself--if I had not been a professed buffoon, that\nis.  These were the only philosophical lives yet open: laughter or\nprayer; sneers, we might say, and tears.  Until the sun of the Positive\narose, the wise man had to make his choice between these two.'\n\n'I have been a buffoon, of course,' observed Jean-Marie.\n\n'I cannot imagine you to have excelled in your profession,' said the\nDoctor, admiring the boy's gravity.  'Do you ever laugh?'\n\n'Oh, yes,' replied the other.  'I laugh often.  I am very fond of jokes.'\n\n'Singular being!' said Desprez.  'But I divagate (I perceive in a\nthousand ways that I grow old).  Franchard was at length destroyed in the\nEnglish wars, the same that levelled Gretz.  But--here is the point--the\nhermits (for there were already more than one) had foreseen the danger\nand carefully concealed the sacrificial vessels.  These vessels were of\nmonstrous value, Jean-Marie--monstrous value--priceless, we may say;\nexquisitely worked, of exquisite material.  And now, mark me, they have\nnever been found.  In the reign of Louis Quatorze some fellows were\ndigging hard by the ruins.  Suddenly--tock!--the spade hit upon an\nobstacle.  Imagine the men fooling one to another; imagine how their\nhearts bounded, how their colour came and went.  It was a coffer, and in\nFranchard the place of buried treasure!  They tore it open like famished\nbeasts.  Alas! it was not the treasure; only some priestly robes, which,\nat the touch of the eating air, fell upon themselves and instantly wasted\ninto dust.  The perspiration of these good fellows turned cold upon them,\nJean-Marie.  I will pledge my reputation, if there was anything like a\ncutting wind, one or other had a pneumonia for his trouble.'\n\n'I should like to have seen them turning into dust,' said Jean-Marie.\n'Otherwise, I should not have cared so greatly.'\n\n'You have no imagination,' cried the Doctor.  'Picture to yourself the\nscene.  Dwell on the idea--a great treasure lying in the earth for\ncenturies: the material for a giddy, copious, opulent existence not\nemployed; dresses and exquisite pictures unseen; the swiftest galloping\nhorses not stirring a hoof, arrested by a spell; women with the beautiful\nfaculty of smiles, not smiling; cards, dice, opera singing, orchestras,\ncastles, beautiful parks and gardens, big ships with a tower of\nsailcloth, all lying unborn in a coffin--and the stupid trees growing\noverhead in the sunlight, year after year.  The thought drives one\nfrantic.'\n\n'It is only money,' replied Jean-Marie.  'It would do harm.'\n\n'O, come!' cried Desprez, 'that is philosophy; it is all very fine, but\nnot to the point just now.  And besides, it is not \"only money,\" as you\ncall it; there are works of art in the question; the vessels were carved.\nYou speak like a child.  You weary me exceedingly, quoting my words out\nof all logical connection, like a parroquet.'\n\n'And at any rate, we have nothing to do with it,' returned the boy\nsubmissively.\n\nThey struck the Route Ronde at that moment; and the sudden change to the\nrattling causeway combined, with the Doctor's irritation, to keep him\nsilent.  The noddy jigged along; the trees went by, looking on silently,\nas if they had something on their minds.  The Quadrilateral was passed;\nthen came Franchard.  They put up the horse at the little solitary inn,\nand went forth strolling.  The gorge was dyed deeply with heather; the\nrocks and birches standing luminous in the sun.  A great humming of bees\nabout the flowers disposed Jean-Marie to sleep, and he sat down against a\nclump of heather, while the Doctor went briskly to and fro, with quick\nturns, culling his simples.\n\nThe boy's head had fallen a little forward, his eyes were closed, his\nfingers had fallen lax about his knees, when a sudden cry called him to\nhis feet.  It was a strange sound, thin and brief; it fell dead, and\nsilence returned as though it had never been interrupted.  He had not\nrecognised the Doctor's voice; but, as there was no one else in all the\nvalley, it was plainly the Doctor who had given utterance to the sound.\nHe looked right and left, and there was Desprez, standing in a niche\nbetween two boulders, and looking round on his adopted son with a\ncountenance as white as paper.\n\n'A viper!' cried Jean-Marie, running towards him.  'A viper!  You are\nbitten!'\n\nThe Doctor came down heavily out of the cleft, and, advanced in silence\nto meet the boy, whom he took roughly by the shoulder.\n\n'I have found it,' he said, with a gasp.\n\n'A plant?' asked Jean-Marie.\n\nDesprez had a fit of unnatural gaiety, which the rocks took up and\nmimicked.  'A plant!' he repeated scornfully.  'Well--yes--a plant.  And\nhere,' he added suddenly, showing his right hand, which he had hitherto\nconcealed behind his back--'here is one of the bulbs.'\n\nJean-Marie saw a dirty platter, coated with earth.\n\n'That?' said he.  'It is a plate!'\n\n'It is a coach and horses,' cried the Doctor.  'Boy,' he continued,\ngrowing warmer, 'I plucked away a great pad of moss from between these\nboulders, and disclosed a crevice; and when I looked in, what do you\nsuppose I saw?  I saw a house in Paris with a court and garden, I saw my\nwife shining with diamonds, I saw myself a deputy, I saw you--well, I--I\nsaw your future,' he concluded, rather feebly.  'I have just discovered\nAmerica,' he added.\n\n'But what is it?' asked the boy.\n\n'The Treasure of Franchard,' cried the Doctor; and, throwing his brown\nstraw hat upon the ground, he whooped like an Indian and sprang upon Jean-\nMarie, whom he suffocated with embraces and bedewed with tears.  Then he\nflung himself down among the heather and once more laughed until the\nvalley rang.\n\nBut the boy had now an interest of his own, a boy's interest.  No sooner\nwas he released from the Doctor's accolade than he ran to the boulders,\nsprang into the niche, and, thrusting his hand into the crevice, drew\nforth one after another, encrusted with the earth of ages, the flagons,\ncandlesticks, and patens of the hermitage of Franchard.  A casket came\nlast, tightly shut and very heavy.\n\n'O what fun!' he cried.\n\nBut when he looked back at the Doctor, who had followed close behind and\nwas silently observing, the words died from his lips.  Desprez was once\nmore the colour of ashes; his lip worked and trembled; a sort of bestial\ngreed possessed him.\n\n'This is childish,' he said.  'We lose precious time.  Back to the inn,\nharness the trap, and bring it to yon bank.  Run for your life, and\nremember--not one whisper.  I stay here to watch.'\n\nJean-Marie did as he was bid, though not without surprise.  The noddy was\nbrought round to the spot indicated; and the two gradually transported\nthe treasure from its place of concealment to the boot below the driving\nseat.  Once it was all stored the Doctor recovered his gaiety.\n\n'I pay my grateful duties to the genius of this dell,' he said.  'O, for\na live coal, a heifer, and a jar of country wine!  I am in the vein for\nsacrifice, for a superb libation.  Well, and why not?  We are at\nFranchard.  English pale ale is to be had--not classical, indeed, but\nexcellent.  Boy, we shall drink ale.'\n\n'But I thought it was so unwholesome,' said Jean-Marie, 'and very dear\nbesides.'\n\n'Fiddle-de-dee!' exclaimed the Doctor gaily.  'To the inn!'\n\nAnd he stepped into the noddy, tossing his head, with an elastic,\nyouthful air.  The horse was turned, and in a few seconds they drew up\nbeside the palings of the inn garden.\n\n'Here,' said Desprez--'here, near the table, so that we may keep an eye\nupon things.'\n\nThey tied the horse, and entered the garden, the Doctor singing, now in\nfantastic high notes, now producing deep reverberations from his chest.\nHe took a seat, rapped loudly on the table, assailed the waiter with\nwitticisms; and when the bottle of Bass was at length produced, far more\ncharged with gas than the most delirious champagne, he filled out a long\nglassful of froth and pushed it over to Jean-Marie.  'Drink,' he said;\n'drink deep.'\n\n'I would rather not,' faltered the boy, true to his training.\n\n'What?' thundered Desprez.\n\n'I am afraid of it,' said Jean-Marie: 'my stomach--'\n\n'Take it or leave it,' interrupted Desprez fiercely; 'but understand it\nonce for all--there is nothing so contemptible as a precisian.'\n\nHere was a new lesson!  The boy sat bemused, looking at the glass but not\ntasting it, while the Doctor emptied and refilled his own, at first with\nclouded brow, but gradually yielding to the sun, the heady, prickling\nbeverage, and his own predisposition to be happy.\n\n'Once in a way,' he said at last, by way of a concession to the boy's\nmore rigorous attitude, 'once in a way, and at so critical a moment, this\nale is a nectar for the gods.  The habit, indeed, is debasing; wine, the\njuice of the grape, is the true drink of the Frenchman, as I have often\nhad occasion to point out; and I do not know that I can blame you for\nrefusing this outlandish stimulant.  You can have some wine and cakes.  Is\nthe bottle empty?  Well, we will not be proud; we will have pity on your\nglass.'\n\nThe beer being done, the Doctor chafed bitterly while Jean-Marie finished\nhis cakes.  'I burn to be gone,' he said, looking at his watch.  'Good\nGod, how slow you eat!'  And yet to eat slowly was his own particular\nprescription, the main secret of longevity!\n\nHis martyrdom, however, reached an end at last; the pair resumed their\nplaces in the buggy, and Desprez, leaning luxuriously back, announced his\nintention of proceeding to Fontainebleau.\n\n'To Fontainebleau?' repeated Jean-Marie.\n\n'My words are always measured,' said the Doctor.  'On!'\n\nThe Doctor was driven through the glades of paradise; the air, the light,\nthe shining leaves, the very movements of the vehicle, seemed to fall in\ntune with his golden meditations; with his head thrown back, he dreamed a\nseries of sunny visions, ale and pleasure dancing in his veins.  At last\nhe spoke.\n\n'I shall telegraph for Casimir,' he said.  'Good Casimir! a fellow of the\nlower order of intelligence, Jean-Marie, distinctly not creative, not\npoetic; and yet he will repay your study; his fortune is vast, and is\nentirely due to his own exertions.  He is the very fellow to help us to\ndispose of our trinkets, find us a suitable house in Paris, and manage\nthe details of our installation.  Admirable Casimir, one of my oldest\ncomrades!  It was on his advice, I may add, that I invested my little\nfortune in Turkish bonds; when we have added these spoils of the mediaeval\nchurch to our stake in the Mahometan empire, little boy, we shall\npositively roll among doubloons, positively roll!  Beautiful forest,' he\ncried, 'farewell!  Though called to other scenes, I will not forget thee.\nThy name is graven in my heart.  Under the influence of prosperity I\nbecome dithyrambic, Jean-Marie.  Such is the impulse of the natural soul;\nsuch was the constitution of primaeval man.  And I--well, I will not\nrefuse the credit--I have preserved my youth like a virginity; another,\nwho should have led the same snoozing, countryfied existence for these\nyears, another had become rusted, become stereotype; but I, I praise my\nhappy constitution, retain the spring unbroken.  Fresh opulence and a new\nsphere of duties find me unabated in ardour and only more mature by\nknowledge.  For this prospective change, Jean-Marie--it may probably have\nshocked you.  Tell me now, did it not strike you as an inconsistency?\nConfess--it is useless to dissemble--it pained you?'\n\n'Yes,' said the boy.\n\n'You see,' returned the Doctor, with sublime fatuity, 'I read your\nthoughts!  Nor am I surprised--your education is not yet complete; the\nhigher duties of men have not been yet presented to you fully.  A\nhint--till we have leisure--must suffice.  Now that I am once more in\npossession of a modest competence; now that I have so long prepared\nmyself in silent meditation, it becomes my superior duty to proceed to\nParis.  My scientific training, my undoubted command of language, mark me\nout for the service of my country.  Modesty in such a case would be a\nsnare.  If sin were a philosophical expression, I should call it sinful.\nA man must not deny his manifest abilities, for that is to evade his\nobligations.  I must be up and doing; I must be no skulker in life's\nbattle.'\n\nSo he rattled on, copiously greasing the joint of his inconsistency with\nwords; while the boy listened silently, his eyes fixed on the horse, his\nmind seething.  It was all lost eloquence; no array of words could\nunsettle a belief of Jean-Marie's; and he drove into Fontainebleau filled\nwith pity, horror, indignation, and despair.\n\nIn the town Jean-Marie was kept a fixture on the driving-seat, to guard\nthe treasure; while the Doctor, with a singular, slightly tipsy airiness\nof manner, fluttered in and out of cafes, where he shook hands with\ngarrison officers, and mixed an absinthe with the nicety of old\nexperience; in and out of shops, from which he returned laden with costly\nfruits, real turtle, a magnificent piece of silk for his wife, a\npreposterous cane for himself, and a kepi of the newest fashion for the\nboy; in and out of the telegraph office, whence he despatched his\ntelegram, and where three hours later he received an answer promising a\nvisit on the morrow; and generally pervaded Fontainebleau with the first\nfine aroma of his divine good humour.\n\nThe sun was very low when they set forth again; the shadows of the forest\ntrees extended across the broad white road that led them home; the\npenetrating odour of the evening wood had already arisen, like a cloud of\nincense, from that broad field of tree-tops; and even in the streets of\nthe town, where the air had been baked all day between white walls, it\ncame in whiffs and pulses, like a distant music.  Half-way home, the last\ngold flicker vanished from a great oak upon the left; and when they came\nforth beyond the borders of the wood, the plain was already sunken in\npearly greyness, and a great, pale moon came swinging skyward through the\nfilmy poplars.\n\nThe Doctor sang, the Doctor whistled, the Doctor talked.  He spoke of the\nwoods, and the wars, and the deposition of dew; he brightened and babbled\nof Paris; he soared into cloudy bombast on the glories of the political\narena.  All was to be changed; as the day departed, it took with it the\nvestiges of an outworn existence, and to-morrow's sun was to inaugurate\nthe new.  'Enough,' he cried, 'of this life of maceration!'  His wife\n(still beautiful, or he was sadly partial) was to be no longer buried;\nshe should now shine before society.  Jean-Marie would find the world at\nhis feet; the roads open to success, wealth, honour, and post-humous\nrenown.  'And O, by the way,' said he, 'for God's sake keep your tongue\nquiet!  You are, of course, a very silent fellow; it is a quality I\ngladly recognise in you--silence, golden silence!  But this is a matter\nof gravity.  No word must get abroad; none but the good Casimir is to be\ntrusted; we shall probably dispose of the vessels in England.'\n\n'But are they not even ours?' the boy said, almost with a sob--it was the\nonly time he had spoken.\n\n'Ours in this sense, that they are nobody else's,' replied the Doctor.\n'But the State would have some claim.  If they were stolen, for instance,\nwe should be unable to demand their restitution; we should have no title;\nwe should be unable even to communicate with the police.  Such is the\nmonstrous condition of the law. {263}  It is a mere instance of what\nremains to be done, of the injustices that may yet be righted by an\nardent, active, and philosophical deputy.'\n\nJean-Marie put his faith in Madame Desprez; and as they drove forward\ndown the road from Bourron, between the rustling poplars, he prayed in\nhis teeth, and whipped up the horse to an unusual speed.  Surely, as soon\nas they arrived, madame would assert her character, and bring this waking\nnightmare to an end.\n\nTheir entrance into Gretz was heralded and accompanied by a most furious\nbarking; all the dogs in the village seemed to smell the treasure in the\nnoddy.  But there was no one in the street, save three lounging landscape\npainters at Tentaillon's door.  Jean-Marie opened the green gate and led\nin the horse and carriage; and almost at the same moment Madame Desprez\ncame to the kitchen threshold with a lighted lantern; for the moon was\nnot yet high enough to clear the garden walls.\n\n'Close the gates, Jean-Marie!' cried the Doctor, somewhat unsteadily\nalighting.  'Anastasie, where is Aline?'\n\n'She has gone to Montereau to see her parents,' said madame.\n\n'All is for the best!' exclaimed the Doctor fervently.  'Here, quick,\ncome near to me; I do not wish to speak too loud,' he continued.\n'Darling, we are wealthy!'\n\n'Wealthy!' repeated the wife.\n\n'I have found the treasure of Franchard,' replied her husband.  'See,\nhere are the first fruits; a pineapple, a dress for my ever-beautiful--it\nwill suit her--trust a husband's, trust a lover's, taste!  Embrace me,\ndarling!  This grimy episode is over; the butterfly unfolds its painted\nwings.  To-morrow Casimir will come; in a week we may be in Paris--happy\nat last!  You shall have diamonds.  Jean-Marie, take it out of the boot,\nwith religious care, and bring it piece by piece into the dining-room.  We\nshall have plate at table!  Darling, hasten and prepare this turtle; it\nwill be a whet--it will be an addition to our meagre ordinary.  I myself\nwill proceed to the cellar.  We shall have a bottle of that little\nBeaujolais you like, and finish with the Hermitage; there are still three\nbottles left.  Worthy wine for a worthy occasion.'\n\n'But, my husband; you put me in a whirl,' she cried.  'I do not\ncomprehend.'\n\n'The turtle, my adored, the turtle!' cried the doctor; and he pushed her\ntowards the kitchen, lantern and all.\n\nJean-Marie stood dumfounded.  He had pictured to himself a different\nscene--a more immediate protest, and his hope began to dwindle on the\nspot.\n\nThe Doctor was everywhere, a little doubtful on his legs, perhaps, and\nnow and then taking the wall with his shoulder; for it was long since he\nhad tasted absinthe, and he was even then reflecting that the absinthe\nhad been a misconception.  Not that he regretted excess on such a\nglorious day, but he made a mental memorandum to beware; he must not, a\nsecond time, become the victim of a deleterious habit.  He had his wine\nout of the cellar in a twinkling; he arranged the sacrificial vessels,\nsome on the white table-cloth, some on the sideboard, still crusted with\nhistoric earth.  He was in and out of the kitchen, plying Anastasie with\nvermouth, heating her with glimpses of the future, estimating their new\nwealth at ever larger figures; and before they sat down to supper, the\nlady's virtue had melted in the fire of his enthusiasm, her timidity had\ndisappeared; she, too, had begun to speak disparagingly of the life at\nGretz; and as she took her place and helped the soup, her eyes shone with\nthe glitter of prospective diamonds.\n\nAll through the meal, she and the Doctor made and unmade fairy plans.\nThey bobbed and bowed and pledged each other.  Their faces ran over with\nsmiles; their eyes scattered sparkles, as they projected the Doctor's\npolitical honours and the lady's drawing-room ovations.\n\n'But you will not be a Red!' cried Anastasie.\n\n'I am Left Centre to the core,' replied the Doctor.\n\n'Madame Gastein will present us--we shall find ourselves forgotten,' said\nthe lady.\n\n'Never,' protested the Doctor.  'Beauty and talent leave a mark.'\n\n'I have positively forgotten how to dress,' she sighed.\n\n'Darling, you make me blush,' cried he.  'Yours has been a tragic\nmarriage!'\n\n'But your success--to see you appreciated, honoured, your name in all the\npapers, that will be more than pleasure--it will be heaven!' she cried.\n\n'And once a week,' said the Doctor, archly scanning the syllables, 'once\na week--one good little game of baccarat?'\n\n'Only once a week?' she questioned, threatening him with a finger.\n\n'I swear it by my political honour,' cried he.\n\n'I spoil you,' she said, and gave him her hand.\n\nHe covered it with kisses.\n\nJean-Marie escaped into the night.  The moon swung high over Gretz.  He\nwent down to the garden end and sat on the jetty.  The river ran by with\neddies of oily silver, and a low, monotonous song.  Faint veils of mist\nmoved among the poplars on the farther side.  The reeds were quietly\nnodding.  A hundred times already had the boy sat, on such a night, and\nwatched the streaming river with untroubled fancy.  And this perhaps was\nto be the last.  He was to leave this familiar hamlet, this green,\nrustling country, this bright and quiet stream; he was to pass into the\ngreat city; his dear lady mistress was to move bedizened in saloons; his\ngood, garrulous, kind-hearted master to become a brawling deputy; and\nboth be lost for ever to Jean-Marie and their better selves.  He knew his\nown defects; he knew he must sink into less and less consideration in the\nturmoil of a city life, sink more and more from the child into the\nservant.  And he began dimly to believe the Doctor's prophecies of evil.\nHe could see a change in both.  His generous incredulity failed him for\nthis once; a child must have perceived that the Hermitage had completed\nwhat the absinthe had begun.  If this were the first day, what would be\nthe last?  'If necessary, wreck the train,' thought he, remembering the\nDoctor's parable.  He looked round on the delightful scene; he drank deep\nof the charmed night air, laden with the scent of hay.  'If necessary,\nwreck the train,' he repeated.  And he rose and returned to the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.  A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, IN TWO PARTS.\n\n\nThe next morning there was a most unusual outcry, in the Doctor's house.\nThe last thing before going to bed, the Doctor had locked up some\nvaluables in the dining-room cupboard; and behold, when he rose again, as\nhe did about four o'clock, the cupboard had been broken open, and the\nvaluables in question had disappeared.  Madame and Jean-Marie were\nsummoned from their rooms, and appeared in hasty toilets; they found the\nDoctor raving, calling the heavens to witness and avenge his injury,\npacing the room bare-footed, with the tails of his night-shirt flirting\nas he turned.\n\n'Gone!' he said; 'the things are gone, the fortune gone!  We are paupers\nonce more.  Boy! what do you know of this?  Speak up, sir, speak up.  Do\nyou know of it?  Where are they?'  He had him by the arm, shaking him\nlike a bag, and the boy's words, if he had any, were jolted forth in\ninarticulate murmurs.  The Doctor, with a revulsion from his own\nviolence, set him down again.  He observed Anastasie in tears.\n'Anastasie,' he said, in quite an altered voice, 'compose yourself,\ncommand your feelings.  I would not have you give way to passion like the\nvulgar.  This--this trifling accident must be lived down.  Jean-Marie,\nbring me my smaller medicine chest.  A gentle laxative is indicated.'\n\nAnd he dosed the family all round, leading the way himself with a double\nquantity.  The wretched Anastasie, who had never been ill in the whole\ncourse of her existence, and whose soul recoiled from remedies, wept\nfloods of tears as she sipped, and shuddered, and protested, and then was\nbullied and shouted at until she sipped again.  As for Jean-Marie, he\ntook his portion down with stoicism.\n\n'I have given him a less amount,' observed the Doctor, 'his youth\nprotecting him against emotion.  And now that we have thus parried any\nmorbid consequences, let us reason.'\n\n'I am so cold,' wailed Anastasie.\n\n'Cold!' cried the Doctor.  'I give thanks to God that I am made of\nfierier material.  Why, madam, a blow like this would set a frog into a\ntranspiration.  If you are cold, you can retire; and, by the way, you\nmight throw me down my trousers.  It is chilly for the legs.'\n\n'Oh, no!' protested Anastasie; 'I will stay with you.'\n\n'Nay, madam, you shall not suffer for your devotion,' said the Doctor.  'I\nwill myself fetch you a shawl.'  And he went upstairs and returned more\nfully clad and with an armful of wraps for the shivering Anastasie.  'And\nnow,' he resumed, 'to investigate this crime.  Let us proceed by\ninduction.  Anastasie, do you know anything that can help us?'  Anastasie\nknew nothing.  'Or you, Jean-Marie?'\n\n'Not I,' replied the boy steadily.\n\n'Good,' returned the Doctor.  'We shall now turn our attention to the\nmaterial evidences.  (I was born to be a detective; I have the eye and\nthe systematic spirit.)  First, violence has been employed.  The door was\nbroken open; and it may be observed, in passing, that the lock was dear\nindeed at what I paid for it: a crow to pluck with Master Goguelat.\nSecond, here is the instrument employed, one of our own table-knives, one\nof our best, my dear; which seems to indicate no preparation on the part\nof the gang--if gang it was.  Thirdly, I observe that nothing has been\nremoved except the Franchard dishes and the casket; our own silver has\nbeen minutely respected.  This is wily; it shows intelligence, a\nknowledge of the code, a desire to avoid legal consequences.  I argue\nfrom this fact that the gang numbers persons of respectability--outward,\nof course, and merely outward, as the robbery proves.  But I argue,\nsecond, that we must have been observed at Franchard itself by some\noccult observer, and dogged throughout the day with a skill and patience\nthat I venture to qualify as consummate.  No ordinary man, no occasional\ncriminal, would have shown himself capable of this combination.  We have\nin our neighbourhood, it is far from improbable, a retired bandit of the\nhighest order of intelligence.'\n\n'Good heaven!' cried the horrified Anastasie.  'Henri, how can you?'\n\n'My cherished one, this is a process of induction,' said the Doctor.  'If\nany of my steps are unsound, correct me.  You are silent?  Then do not, I\nbeseech you, be so vulgarly illogical as to revolt from my conclusion.  We\nhave now arrived,' he resumed, 'at some idea of the composition of the\ngang--for I incline to the hypothesis of more than one--and we now leave\nthis room, which can disclose no more, and turn our attention to the\ncourt and garden.  (Jean-Marie, I trust you are observantly following my\nvarious steps; this is an excellent piece of education for you.)  Come\nwith me to the door.  No steps on the court; it is unfortunate our court\nshould be paved.  On what small matters hang the destiny of these\ndelicate investigations!  Hey!  What have we here?  I have led on to the\nvery spot,' he said, standing grandly backward and indicating the green\ngate.  'An escalade, as you can now see for yourselves, has taken place.'\n\nSure enough, the green paint was in several places scratched and broken;\nand one of the panels preserved the print of a nailed shoe.  The foot had\nslipped, however, and it was difficult to estimate the size of the shoe,\nand impossible to distinguish the pattern of the nails.\n\n'The whole robbery,' concluded the Doctor, 'step by step, has been\nreconstituted.  Inductive science can no further go.'\n\n'It is wonderful,' said his wife.  'You should indeed have been a\ndetective, Henri.  I had no idea of your talents.'\n\n'My dear,' replied Desprez, condescendingly, 'a man of scientific\nimagination combines the lesser faculties; he is a detective just as he\nis a publicist or a general; these are but local applications of his\nspecial talent.  But now,' he continued, 'would you have me go further?\nWould you have me lay my finger on the culprits--or rather, for I cannot\npromise quite so much, point out to you the very house where they\nconsort?  It may be a satisfaction, at least it is all we are likely to\nget, since we are denied the remedy of law.  I reach the further stage in\nthis way.  In order to fill my outline of the robbery, I require a man\nlikely to be in the forest idling, I require a man of education, I\nrequire a man superior to considerations of morality.  The three\nrequisites all centre in Tentaillon's boarders.  They are painters,\ntherefore they are continually lounging in the forest.  They are\npainters, therefore they are not unlikely to have some smattering of\neducation.  Lastly, because they are painters, they are probably immoral.\nAnd this I prove in two ways.  First, painting is an art which merely\naddresses the eye; it does not in any particular exercise the moral\nsense.  And second, painting, in common with all the other arts, implies\nthe dangerous quality of imagination.  A man of imagination is never\nmoral; he outsoars literal demarcations and reviews life under too many\nshifting lights to rest content with the invidious distinctions of the\nlaw!'\n\n'But you always say--at least, so I understood you'--said madame, 'that\nthese lads display no imagination whatever.'\n\n'My dear, they displayed imagination, and of a very fantastic order,\ntoo,' returned the Doctor, 'when they embraced their beggarly profession.\nBesides--and this is an argument exactly suited to your intellectual\nlevel--many of them are English and American.  Where else should we\nexpect to find a thief?--And now you had better get your coffee.  Because\nwe have lost a treasure, there is no reason for starving.  For my part, I\nshall break my fast with white wine.  I feel unaccountably heated and\nthirsty to-day.  I can only attribute it to the shock of the discovery.\nAnd yet, you will bear me out, I supported the emotion nobly.'\n\nThe Doctor had now talked himself back into an admirable humour; and as\nhe sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed a large allowance of white wine\nand picked a little bread and cheese with no very impetuous appetite, if\na third of his meditations ran upon the missing treasure, the other two-\nthirds were more pleasingly busied in the retrospect of his detective\nskill.\n\nAbout eleven Casimir arrived; he had caught an early train to\nFontainebleau, and driven over to save time; and now his cab was stabled\nat Tentaillon's, and he remarked, studying his watch, that he could spare\nan hour and a half.  He was much the man of business, decisively spoken,\ngiven to frowning in an intellectual manner.  Anastasie's born brother,\nhe did not waste much sentiment on the lady, gave her an English family\nkiss, and demanded a meal without delay.\n\n'You can tell me your story while we eat,' he observed.  'Anything good\nto-day, Stasie?'\n\nHe was promised something good.  The trio sat down to table in the\narbour, Jean-Marie waiting as well as eating, and the Doctor recounted\nwhat had happened in his richest narrative manner.  Casimir heard it with\nexplosions of laughter.\n\n'What a streak of luck for you, my good brother,' he observed, when the\ntale was over.  'If you had gone to Paris, you would have played dick-\nduck-drake with the whole consignment in three months.  Your own would\nhave followed; and you would have come to me in a procession like the\nlast time.  But I give you warning--Stasie may weep and Henri\nratiocinate--it will not serve you twice.  Your next collapse will be\nfatal.  I thought I had told you so, Stasie?  Hey?  No sense?'\n\nThe Doctor winced and looked furtively at Jean-Marie; but the boy seemed\napathetic.\n\n'And then again,' broke out Casimir, 'what children you are--vicious\nchildren, my faith!  How could you tell the value of this trash?  It\nmight have been worth nothing, or next door.'\n\n'Pardon me,' said the Doctor.  'You have your usual flow of spirits, I\nperceive, but even less than your usual deliberation.  I am not entirely\nignorant of these matters.'\n\n'Not entirely ignorant of anything ever I heard of,' interrupted Casimir,\nbowing, and raising his glass with a sort of pert politeness.\n\n'At least,' resumed the Doctor, 'I gave my mind to the subject--that you\nmay be willing to believe--and I estimated that our capital would be\ndoubled.'  And he described the nature of the find.\n\n'My word of honour!' said Casimir, 'I half believe you!  But much would\ndepend on the quality of the gold.'\n\n'The quality, my dear Casimir, was--'  And the Doctor, in default of\nlanguage, kissed his finger-tips.\n\n'I would not take your word for it, my good friend,' retorted the man of\nbusiness.  'You are a man of very rosy views.  But this robbery,' he\ncontinued--'this robbery is an odd thing.  Of course I pass over your\nnonsense about gangs and landscape-painters.  For me, that is a dream.\nWho was in the house last night?'\n\n'None but ourselves,' replied the Doctor.\n\n'And this young gentleman?' asked Casimir, jerking a nod in the direction\nof Jean-Marie.\n\n'He too'--the Doctor bowed.\n\n'Well; and if it is a fair question, who is he?' pursued the brother-in-\nlaw.\n\n'Jean-Marie,' answered the Doctor, 'combines the functions of a son and\nstable-boy.  He began as the latter, but he rose rapidly to the more\nhonourable rank in our affections.  He is, I may say, the greatest\ncomfort in our lives.'\n\n'Ha!' said Casimir.  'And previous to becoming one of you?'\n\n'Jean-Marie has lived a remarkable existence; his experience his been\neminently formative,' replied Desprez.  'If I had had to choose an\neducation for my son, I should have chosen such another.  Beginning life\nwith mountebanks and thieves, passing onward to the society and\nfriendship of philosophers, he may be said to have skimmed the volume of\nhuman life.'\n\n'Thieves?' repeated the brother-in-law, with a meditative air.\n\nThe Doctor could have bitten his tongue out.  He foresaw what was coming,\nand prepared his mind for a vigorous defence.\n\n'Did you ever steal yourself?' asked Casimir, turning suddenly on Jean-\nMarie, and for the first time employing a single eyeglass which hung\nround his neck.\n\n'Yes, sir,' replied the boy, with a deep blush.\n\nCasimir turned to the others with pursed lips, and nodded to them\nmeaningly.  'Hey?' said he; 'how is that?'\n\n'Jean-Marie is a teller of the truth,' returned the Doctor, throwing out\nhis bust.\n\n'He has never told a lie,' added madame.  'He is the best of boys.'\n\n'Never told a lie, has he not?' reflected Casimir.  'Strange, very\nstrange.  Give me your attention, my young friend,' he continued.  'You\nknew about this treasure?'\n\n'He helped to bring it home,' interposed the Doctor.\n\n'Desprez, I ask you nothing but to hold your tongue,' returned Casimir.\n'I mean to question this stable-boy of yours; and if you are so certain\nof his innocence, you can afford to let him answer for himself.  Now,\nsir,' he resumed, pointing his eyeglass straight at Jean-Marie.  'You\nknew it could be stolen with impunity?  You knew you could not be\nprosecuted?  Come!  Did you, or did you not?'\n\n'I did,' answered Jean-Marie, in a miserable whisper.  He sat there\nchanging colour like a revolving pharos, twisting his fingers\nhysterically, swallowing air, the picture of guilt.\n\n'You knew where it was put?' resumed the inquisitor.\n\n'Yes,' from Jean-Marie.\n\n'You say you have been a thief before,' continued Casimir.  'Now how am I\nto know that you are not one still?  I suppose you could climb the green\ngate?'\n\n'Yes,' still lower, from the culprit.\n\n'Well, then, it was you who stole these things.  You know it, and you\ndare not deny it.  Look me in the face!  Raise your sneak's eyes, and\nanswer!'\n\nBut in place of anything of that sort Jean-Marie broke into a dismal howl\nand fled from the arbour.  Anastasie, as she pursued to capture and\nreassure the victim, found time to send one Parthian arrow--'Casimir, you\nare a brute!'\n\n'My brother,' said Desprez, with the greatest dignity, 'you take upon\nyourself a licence--'\n\n'Desprez,' interrupted Casimir, 'for Heaven's sake be a man of the world.\nYou telegraph me to leave my business and come down here on yours.  I\ncome, I ask the business, you say \"Find me this thief!\"  Well, I find\nhim; I say \"There he is!\"  You need not like it, but you have no manner\nof right to take offence.'\n\n'Well,' returned the Doctor, 'I grant that; I will even thank you for\nyour mistaken zeal.  But your hypothesis was so extravagantly monstrous--'\n\n'Look here,' interrupted Casimir; 'was it you or Stasie?'\n\n'Certainly not,' answered the Doctor.\n\n'Very well; then it was the boy.  Say no more about it,' said the brother-\nin-law, and he produced his cigar-case.\n\n'I will say this much more,' returned Desprez: 'if that boy came and told\nme so himself, I should not believe him; and if I did believe him, so\nimplicit is my trust, I should conclude that he had acted for the best.'\n\n'Well, well,' said Casimir, indulgently.  'Have you a light?  I must be\ngoing.  And by the way, I wish you would let me sell your Turks for you.\nI always told you, it meant smash.  I tell you so again.  Indeed, it was\npartly that that brought me down.  You never acknowledge my letters--a\nmost unpardonable habit.'\n\n'My good brother,' replied the Doctor blandly, 'I have never denied your\nability in business; but I can perceive your limitations.'\n\n'Egad, my friend, I can return the compliment,' observed the man of\nbusiness.  'Your limitation is to be downright irrational.'\n\n'Observe the relative position,' returned the Doctor with a smile.  'It\nis your attitude to believe through thick and thin in one man's\njudgment--your own.  I follow the same opinion, but critically and with\nopen eyes.  Which is the more irrational?--I leave it to yourself.'\n\n'O, my dear fellow!' cried Casimir, 'stick to your Turks, stick to your\nstable-boy, go to the devil in general in your own way and be done with\nit.  But don't ratiocinate with me--I cannot bear it.  And so, ta-ta.  I\nmight as well have stayed away for any good I've done.  Say good-bye from\nme to Stasie, and to the sullen hang-dog of a stable-boy, if you insist\non it; I'm off.'\n\nAnd Casimir departed.  The Doctor, that night, dissected his character\nbefore Anastasie.  'One thing, my beautiful,' he said, 'he has learned\none thing from his lifelong acquaintance with your husband: the word\n_ratiocinate_.  It shines in his vocabulary, like a jewel in a muck-heap.\nAnd, even so, he continually misapplies it.  For you must have observed\nhe uses it as a sort of taunt, in the sense of to _ergotise_, implying,\nas it were--the poor, dear fellow!--a vein of sophistry.  As for his\ncruelty to Jean-Marie, it must be forgiven him--it is not his nature, it\nis the nature of his life.  A man who deals with money, my dear, is a man\nlost.'\n\nWith Jean-Marie the process of reconciliation had been somewhat slow.  At\nfirst he was inconsolable, insisted on leaving the family, went from\nparoxysm to paroxysm of tears; and it was only after Anastasie had been\ncloseted for an hour with him, alone, that she came forth, sought out the\nDoctor, and, with tears in her eyes, acquainted that gentleman with what\nhad passed.\n\n'At first, my husband, he would hear of nothing,' she said.  'Imagine! if\nhe had left us! what would the treasure be to that?  Horrible treasure,\nit has brought all this about!  At last, after he has sobbed his very\nheart out, he agrees to stay on a condition--we are not to mention this\nmatter, this infamous suspicion, not even to mention the robbery.  On\nthat agreement only, the poor, cruel boy will consent to remain among his\nfriends.'\n\n'But this inhibition,' said the Doctor, 'this embargo--it cannot possibly\napply to me?'\n\n'To all of us,' Anastasie assured him.\n\n'My cherished one,' Desprez protested, 'you must have misunderstood.  It\ncannot apply to me.  He would naturally come to me.'\n\n'Henri,' she said, 'it does; I swear to you it does.'\n\n'This is a painful, a very painful circumstance,' the Doctor said,\nlooking a little black.  'I cannot affect, Anastasie, to be anything but\njustly wounded.  I feel this, I feel it, my wife, acutely.'\n\n'I knew you would,' she said.  'But if you had seen his distress!  We\nmust make allowances, we must sacrifice our feelings.'\n\n'I trust, my dear, you have never found me averse to sacrifices,'\nreturned the Doctor very stiffly.\n\n'And you will let me go and tell him that you have agreed?  It will be\nlike your noble nature,' she cried.\n\nSo it would, he perceived--it would be like his noble nature!  Up jumped\nhis spirits, triumphant at the thought.  'Go, darling,' he said nobly,\n'reassure him.  The subject is buried; more--I make an effort, I have\naccustomed my will to these exertions--and it is forgotten.'\n\nA little after, but still with swollen eyes and looking mortally\nsheepish, Jean-Marie reappeared and went ostentatiously about his\nbusiness.  He was the only unhappy member of the party that sat down that\nnight to supper.  As for the Doctor, he was radiant.  He thus sang the\nrequiem of the treasure:--\n\n'This has been, on the whole, a most amusing episode,' he said.  'We are\nnot a penny the worse--nay, we are immensely gainers.  Our philosophy has\nbeen exercised; some of the turtle is still left--the most wholesome of\ndelicacies; I have my staff, Anastasie has her new dress, Jean-Marie is\nthe proud possessor of a fashionable kepi.  Besides, we had a glass of\nHermitage last night; the glow still suffuses my memory.  I was growing\npositively niggardly with that Hermitage, positively niggardly.  Let me\ntake the hint: we had one bottle to celebrate the appearance of our\nvisionary fortune; let us have a second to console us for its\noccultation.  The third I hereby dedicate to Jean-Marie's wedding\nbreakfast.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.  THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF DESPREZ.\n\n\nThe Doctor's house has not yet received the compliment of a description,\nand it is now high time that the omission were supplied, for the house is\nitself an actor in the story, and one whose part is nearly at an end.  Two\nstories in height, walls of a warm yellow, tiles of an ancient ruddy\nbrown diversified with moss and lichen, it stood with one wall to the\nstreet in the angle of the Doctor's property.  It was roomy, draughty,\nand inconvenient.  The large rafters were here and there engraven with\nrude marks and patterns; the handrail of the stair was carved in\ncountrified arabesque; a stout timber pillar, which did duty to support\nthe dining-room roof, bore mysterious characters on its darker side,\nrunes, according to the Doctor; nor did he fail, when he ran over the\nlegendary history of the house and its possessors, to dwell upon the\nScandinavian scholar who had left them.  Floors, doors, and rafters made\na great variety of angles; every room had a particular inclination; the\ngable had tilted towards the garden, after the manner of a leaning tower,\nand one of the former proprietors had buttressed the building from that\nside with a great strut of wood, like the derrick of a crane.  Altogether,\nit had many marks of ruin; it was a house for the rats to desert; and\nnothing but its excellent brightness--the window-glass polished and\nshining, the paint well scoured, the brasses radiant, the very prop all\nwreathed about with climbing flowers--nothing but its air of a\nwell-tended, smiling veteran, sitting, crutch and all, in the sunny\ncorner of a garden, marked it as a house for comfortable people to\ninhabit.  In poor or idle management it would soon have hurried into the\nblackguard stages of decay.  As it was, the whole family loved it, and\nthe Doctor was never better inspired than when he narrated its imaginary\nstory and drew the character of its successive masters, from the Hebrew\nmerchant who had re-edified its walls after the sack of the town, and\npast the mysterious engraver of the runes, down to the long-headed, dirty-\nhanded boor from whom he had himself acquired it at a ruinous expense.  As\nfor any alarm about its security, the idea had never presented itself.\nWhat had stood four centuries might well endure a little longer.\n\nIndeed, in this particular winter, after the finding and losing of the\ntreasure, the Desprez' had an anxiety of a very different order, and one\nwhich lay nearer their hearts.  Jean-Marie was plainly not himself.  He\nhad fits of hectic activity, when he made unusual exertions to please,\nspoke more and faster, and redoubled in attention to his lessons.  But\nthese were interrupted by spells of melancholia and brooding silence,\nwhen the boy was little better than unbearable.\n\n'Silence,' the Doctor moralised--'you see, Anastasie, what comes of\nsilence.  Had the boy properly unbosomed himself, the little\ndisappointment about the treasure, the little annoyance about Casimir's\nincivility, would long ago have been forgotten.  As it is, they prey upon\nhim like a disease.  He loses flesh, his appetite is variable and, on the\nwhole, impaired.  I keep him on the strictest regimen, I exhibit the most\npowerful tonics; both in vain.'\n\n'Don't you think you drug him too much?' asked madame, with an\nirrepressible shudder.\n\n'Drug?' cried the Doctor; 'I drug?  Anastasie, you are mad!'\n\nTime went on, and the boy's health still slowly declined.  The Doctor\nblamed the weather, which was cold and boisterous.  He called in his\n_confrere_ from Bourron, took a fancy for him, magnified his capacity,\nand was pretty soon under treatment himself--it scarcely appeared for\nwhat complaint.  He and Jean-Marie had each medicine to take at different\nperiods of the day.  The Doctor used to lie in wait for the exact moment,\nwatch in hand.  'There is nothing like regularity,' he would say, fill\nout the doses, and dilate on the virtues of the draught; and if the boy\nseemed none the better, the Doctor was not at all the worse.\n\nGunpowder Day, the boy was particularly low.  It was scowling, squally\nweather.  Huge broken companies of cloud sailed swiftly overhead; raking\ngleams of sunlight swept the village, and were followed by intervals of\ndarkness and white, flying rain.  At times the wind lifted up its voice\nand bellowed.  The trees were all scourging themselves along the meadows,\nthe last leaves flying like dust.\n\nThe Doctor, between the boy and the weather, was in his element; he had a\ntheory to prove.  He sat with his watch out and a barometer in front of\nhim, waiting for the squalls and noting their effect upon the human\npulse.  'For the true philosopher,' he remarked delightedly, 'every fact\nin nature is a toy.'  A letter came to him; but, as its arrival coincided\nwith the approach of another gust, he merely crammed it into his pocket,\ngave the time to Jean-Marie, and the next moment they were both counting\ntheir pulses as if for a wager.\n\nAt nightfall the wind rose into a tempest.  It besieged the hamlet,\napparently from every side, as if with batteries of cannon; the houses\nshook and groaned; live coals were blown upon the floor.  The uproar and\nterror of the night kept people long awake, sitting with pallid faces\ngiving ear.\n\nIt was twelve before the Desprez family retired.  By half-past one, when\nthe storm was already somewhat past its height, the Doctor was awakened\nfrom a troubled slumber, and sat up.  A noise still rang in his ears, but\nwhether of this world or the world of dreams he was not certain.  Another\nclap of wind followed.  It was accompanied by a sickening movement of the\nwhole house, and in the subsequent lull Desprez could hear the tiles\npouring like a cataract into the loft above his head.  He plucked\nAnastasie bodily out of bed.\n\n'Run!' he cried, thrusting some wearing apparel into her hands; 'the\nhouse is falling!  To the garden!'\n\nShe did not pause to be twice bidden; she was down the stair in an\ninstant.  She had never before suspected herself of such activity.  The\nDoctor meanwhile, with the speed of a piece of pantomime business, and\nundeterred by broken shins, proceeded to rout out Jean-Marie, tore Aline\nfrom her virgin slumbers, seized her by the hand, and tumbled downstairs\nand into the garden, with the girl tumbling behind him, still not half\nawake.\n\nThe fugitives rendezvous'd in the arbour by some common instinct.  Then\ncame a bull's-eye flash of struggling moonshine, which disclosed their\nfour figures standing huddled from the wind in a raffle of flying\ndrapery, and not without a considerable need for more.  At the\nhumiliating spectacle Anastasie clutched her nightdress desperately about\nher and burst loudly into tears.  The Doctor flew to console her; but she\nelbowed him away.  She suspected everybody of being the general public,\nand thought the darkness was alive with eyes.\n\nAnother gleam and another violent gust arrived together; the house was\nseen to rock on its foundation, and, just as the light was once more\neclipsed, a crash which triumphed over the shouting of the wind announced\nits fall, and for a moment the whole garden was alive with skipping tiles\nand brickbats.  One such missile grazed the Doctor's ear; another\ndescended on the bare foot of Aline, who instantly made night hideous\nwith her shrieks.\n\nBy this time the hamlet was alarmed, lights flashed from the windows,\nhails reached the party, and the Doctor answered, nobly contending\nagainst Aline and the tempest.  But this prospect of help only awakened\nAnastasie to a more active stage of terror.\n\n'Henri, people will be coming,' she screamed in her husband's ear.\n\n'I trust so,' he replied.\n\n'They cannot.  I would rather die,' she wailed.\n\n'My dear,' said the Doctor reprovingly, 'you are excited.  I gave you\nsome clothes.  What have you done with them?'\n\n'Oh, I don't know--I must have thrown them away!  Where are they?' she\nsobbed.\n\nDesprez groped about in the darkness.  'Admirable!' he remarked; 'my grey\nvelveteen trousers!  This will exactly meet your necessities.'\n\n'Give them to me!' she cried fiercely; but as soon as she had them in her\nhands her mood appeared to alter--she stood silent for a moment, and then\npressed the garment back upon the Doctor.  'Give it to Aline,' she\nsaid--'poor girl.'\n\n'Nonsense!' said the Doctor.  'Aline does not know what she is about.\nAline is beside herself with terror; and at any rate, she is a peasant.\nNow I am really concerned at this exposure for a person of your\nhousekeeping habits; my solicitude and your fantastic modesty both point\nto the same remedy--the pantaloons.'  He held them ready.\n\n'It is impossible.  You do not understand,' she said with dignity.\n\nBy this time rescue was at hand.  It had been found impracticable to\nenter by the street, for the gate was blocked with masonry, and the\nnodding ruin still threatened further avalanches.  But between the\nDoctor's garden and the one on the right hand there was that very\npicturesque contrivance--a common well; the door on the Desprez' side had\nchanced to be unbolted, and now, through the arched aperture a man's\nbearded face and an arm supporting a lantern were introduced into the\nworld of windy darkness, where Anastasie concealed her woes.  The light\nstruck here and there among the tossing apple boughs, it glinted on the\ngrass; but the lantern and the glowing face became the centre of the\nworld.  Anastasie crouched back from the intrusion.\n\n'This way!' shouted the man.  'Are you all safe?'  Aline, still\nscreaming, ran to the new comer, and was presently hauled head-foremost\nthrough the wall.\n\n'Now, Anastasie, come on; it is your turn,' said the husband.\n\n'I cannot,' she replied.\n\n'Are we all to die of exposure, madame?' thundered Doctor Desprez.\n\n'You can go!' she cried.  'Oh, go, go away!  I can stay here; I am quite\nwarm.'\n\nThe Doctor took her by the shoulders with an oath.\n\n'Stop!' she screamed.  'I will put them on.'\n\nShe took the detested lendings in her hand once more; but her repulsion\nwas stronger than shame.  'Never!' she cried, shuddering, and flung them\nfar away into the night.\n\nNext moment the Doctor had whirled her to the well.  The man was there\nand the lantern; Anastasie closed her eyes and appeared to herself to be\nabout to die.  How she was transported through the arch she knew not; but\nonce on the other side she was received by the neighbour's wife, and\nenveloped in a friendly blanket.\n\nBeds were made ready for the two women, clothes of very various sizes for\nthe Doctor and Jean-Marie; and for the remainder of the night, while\nmadame dozed in and out on the borderland of hysterics, her husband sat\nbeside the fire and held forth to the admiring neighbours.  He showed\nthem, at length, the causes of the accident; for years, he explained, the\nfall had been impending; one sign had followed another, the joints had\nopened, the plaster had cracked, the old walls bowed inward; last, not\nthree weeks ago, the cellar door had begun to work with difficulty in its\ngrooves.  'The cellar!' he said, gravely shaking his head over a glass of\nmulled wine.  'That reminds me of my poor vintages.  By a manifest\nprovidence the Hermitage was nearly at an end.  One bottle--I lose but\none bottle of that incomparable wine.  It had been set apart against Jean-\nMarie's wedding.  Well, I must lay down some more; it will be an interest\nin life.  I am, however, a man somewhat advanced in years.  My great work\nis now buried in the fall of my humble roof; it will never be\ncompleted--my name will have been writ in water.  And yet you find me\ncalm--I would say cheerful.  Can your priest do more?'\n\nBy the first glimpse of day the party sallied forth from the fireside\ninto the street.  The wind had fallen, but still charioted a world of\ntroubled clouds; the air bit like frost; and the party, as they stood\nabout the ruins in the rainy twilight of the morning, beat upon their\nbreasts and blew into their hands for warmth.  The house had entirely\nfallen, the walls outward, the roof in; it was a mere heap of rubbish,\nwith here and there a forlorn spear of broken rafter.  A sentinel was\nplaced over the ruins to protect the property, and the party adjourned to\nTentaillon's to break their fast at the Doctor's expense.  The bottle\ncirculated somewhat freely; and before they left the table it had begun\nto snow.\n\nFor three days the snow continued to fall, and the ruins, covered with\ntarpaulin and watched by sentries, were left undisturbed.  The Desprez'\nmeanwhile had taken up their abode at Tentaillon's.  Madame spent her\ntime in the kitchen, concocting little delicacies, with the admiring aid\nof Madame Tentaillon, or sitting by the fire in thoughtful abstraction.\nThe fall of the house affected her wonderfully little; that blow had been\nparried by another; and in her mind she was continually fighting over\nagain the battle of the trousers.  Had she done right?  Had she done\nwrong?  And now she would applaud her determination; and anon, with a\nhorrid flush of unavailing penitence, she would regret the trousers.  No\njuncture in her life had so much exercised her judgment.  In the meantime\nthe Doctor had become vastly pleased with his situation.  Two of the\nsummer boarders still lingered behind the rest, prisoners for lack of a\nremittance; they were both English, but one of them spoke French pretty\nfluently, and was, besides, a humorous, agile-minded fellow, with whom\nthe Doctor could reason by the hour, secure of comprehension.  Many were\nthe glasses they emptied, many the topics they discussed.\n\n'Anastasie,' the Doctor said on the third morning, 'take an example from\nyour husband, from Jean-Marie!  The excitement has done more for the boy\nthan all my tonics, he takes his turn as sentry with positive gusto.  As\nfor me, you behold me.  I have made friends with the Egyptians; and my\nPharaoh is, I swear it, a most agreeable companion.  You alone are\nhipped.  About a house--a few dresses?  What are they in comparison to\nthe \"Pharmacopoeia\"--the labour of years lying buried below stones and\nsticks in this depressing hamlet?  The snow falls; I shake it from my\ncloak!  Imitate me.  Our income will be impaired, I grant it, since we\nmust rebuild; but moderation, patience, and philosophy will gather about\nthe hearth.  In the meanwhile, the Tentaillons are obliging; the table,\nwith your additions, will pass; only the wine is execrable--well, I shall\nsend for some to-day.  My Pharaoh will be gratified to drink a decent\nglass; aha! and I shall see if he possesses that acme of organisation--a\npalate.  If he has a palate, he is perfect.'\n\n'Henri,' she said, shaking her head, 'you are a man; you cannot\nunderstand my feelings; no woman could shake off the memory of so public\na humiliation.'  The Doctor could not restrain a titter.  'Pardon me,\ndarling,' he said; 'but really, to the philosophical intelligence, the\nincident appears so small a trifle.  You looked extremely well--'\n\n'Henri!' she cried.\n\n'Well, well, I will say no more,' he replied.  'Though, to be sure, if\nyou had consented to indue--_A propos_,' he broke off, 'and my trousers!\nThey are lying in the snow--my favourite trousers!'  And he dashed in\nquest of Jean-Marie.\n\nTwo hours afterwards the boy returned to the inn with a spade under one\narm and a curious sop of clothing under the other.\n\nThe Doctor ruefully took it in his hands.  'They have been!' he said.\n'Their tense is past.  Excellent pantaloons, you are no more!  Stay,\nsomething in the pocket,' and he produced a piece of paper.  'A letter!\nay, now I mind me; it was received on the morning of the gale, when I was\nabsorbed in delicate investigations.  It is still legible.  From poor,\ndear Casimir!  It is as well,' he chuckled, 'that I have educated him to\npatience.  Poor Casimir and his correspondence--his infinitesimal,\ntimorous, idiotic correspondence!'\n\nHe had by this time cautiously unfolded the wet letter; but, as he bent\nhimself to decipher the writing, a cloud descended on his brow.\n\n'_Bigre_!' he cried, with a galvanic start.\n\nAnd then the letter was whipped into the fire, and the Doctor's cap was\non his head in the turn of a hand.\n\n'Ten minutes!  I can catch it, if I run,' he cried.  'It is always late.\nI go to Paris.  I shall telegraph.'\n\n'Henri! what is wrong?' cried his wife.\n\n'Ottoman Bonds!' came from the disappearing Doctor; and Anastasie and\nJean-Marie were left face to face with the wet trousers.  Desprez had\ngone to Paris, for the second time in seven years; he had gone to Paris\nwith a pair of wooden shoes, a knitted spencer, a black blouse, a country\nnightcap, and twenty francs in his pocket.  The fall of the house was but\na secondary marvel; the whole world might have fallen and scarce left his\nfamily more petrified.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE WAGES OF PHILOSOPHY.\n\n\nOn the morning of the next day, the Doctor, a mere spectre of himself,\nwas brought back in the custody of Casimir.  They found Anastasie and the\nboy sitting together by the fire; and Desprez, who had exchanged his\ntoilette for a ready-made rig-out of poor materials, waved his hand as he\nentered, and sank speechless on the nearest chair.  Madame turned direct\nto Casimir.\n\n'What is wrong?' she cried.\n\n'Well,' replied Casimir, 'what have I told you all along?  It has come.\nIt is a clean shave, this time; so you may as well bear up and make the\nbest of it.  House down, too, eh?  Bad luck, upon my soul.'\n\n'Are we--are we--ruined?' she gasped.\n\nThe Doctor stretched out his arms to her.  'Ruined,' he replied, 'you are\nruined by your sinister husband.'\n\nCasimir observed the consequent embrace through his eyeglass; then he\nturned to Jean-Marie.  'You hear?' he said.  'They are ruined; no more\npickings, no more house, no more fat cutlets.  It strikes me, my friend,\nthat you had best be packing; the present speculation is about worked\nout.'  And he nodded to him meaningly.\n\n'Never!' cried Desprez, springing up.  'Jean-Marie, if you prefer to\nleave me, now that I am poor, you can go; you shall receive your hundred\nfrancs, if so much remains to me.  But if you will consent to stay'--the\nDoctor wept a little--'Casimir offers me a place--as clerk,' he resumed.\n'The emoluments are slender, but they will be enough for three.  It is\ntoo much already to have lost my fortune; must I lose my son?'\n\nJean-Marie sobbed bitterly, but without a word.\n\n'I don't like boys who cry,' observed Casimir.  'This one is always\ncrying.  Here! you clear out of this for a little; I have business with\nyour master and mistress, and these domestic feelings may be settled\nafter I am gone.  March!' and he held the door open.\n\nJean-Marie slunk out, like a detected thief.\n\nBy twelve they were all at table but Jean-Marie.\n\n'Hey?' said Casimir.  'Gone, you see.  Took the hint at once.'\n\n'I do not, I confess,' said Desprez, 'I do not seek to excuse his\nabsence.  It speaks a want of heart that disappoints me sorely.'\n\n'Want of manners,' corrected Casimir.  'Heart, he never had.  Why,\nDesprez, for a clever fellow, you are the most gullible mortal in\ncreation.  Your ignorance of human nature and human business is beyond\nbelief.  You are swindled by heathen Turks, swindled by vagabond\nchildren, swindled right and left, upstairs and downstairs.  I think it\nmust be your imagination.  I thank my stars I have none.'\n\n'Pardon me,' replied Desprez, still humbly, but with a return of spirit\nat sight of a distinction to be drawn; 'pardon me, Casimir.  You possess,\neven to an eminent degree, the commercial imagination.  It was the lack\nof that in me--it appears it is my weak point--that has led to these\nrepeated shocks.  By the commercial imagination the financier forecasts\nthe destiny of his investments, marks the falling house--'\n\n'Egad,' interrupted Casimir: 'our friend the stable-boy appears to have\nhis share of it.'\n\nThe Doctor was silenced; and the meal was continued and finished\nprincipally to the tune of the brother-in-law's not very consolatory\nconversation.  He entirely ignored the two young English painters,\nturning a blind eyeglass to their salutations, and continuing his remarks\nas if he were alone in the bosom of his family; and with every second\nword he ripped another stitch out of the air balloon of Desprez's vanity.\nBy the time coffee was over the poor Doctor was as limp as a napkin.\n\n'Let us go and see the ruins,' said Casimir.\n\nThey strolled forth into the street.  The fall of the house, like the\nloss of a front tooth, had quite transformed the village.  Through the\ngap the eye commanded a great stretch of open snowy country, and the\nplace shrank in comparison.  It was like a room with an open door.  The\nsentinel stood by the green gate, looking very red and cold, but he had a\npleasant word for the Doctor and his wealthy kinsman.\n\nCasimir looked at the mound of ruins, he tried the quality of the\ntarpaulin.  'H'm,' he said, 'I hope the cellar arch has stood.  If it\nhas, my good brother, I will give you a good price for the wines.'\n\n'We shall start digging to-morrow,' said the sentry.  'There is no more\nfear of snow.'\n\n'My friend,' returned Casimir sententiously, 'you had better wait till\nyou get paid.'\n\nThe Doctor winced, and began dragging his offensive brother-in-law\ntowards Tentaillon's.  In the house there would be fewer auditors, and\nthese already in the secret of his fall.\n\n'Hullo!' cried Casimir, 'there goes the stable-boy with his luggage; no,\negad, he is taking it into the inn.'\n\nAnd sure enough, Jean-Marie was seen to cross the snowy street and enter\nTentaillon's, staggering under a large hamper.\n\nThe Doctor stopped with a sudden, wild hope.\n\n'What can he have?' he said.  'Let us go and see.'  And he hurried on.\n\n'His luggage, to be sure,' answered Casimir.  'He is on the move--thanks\nto the commercial imagination.'\n\n'I have not seen that hamper for--for ever so long,' remarked the Doctor.\n\n'Nor will you see it much longer,' chuckled Casimir; 'unless, indeed, we\ninterfere.  And by the way, I insist on an examination.'\n\n'You will not require,' said Desprez, positively with a sob; and, casting\na moist, triumphant glance at Casimir, he began to run.\n\n'What the devil is up with him, I wonder?' Casimir reflected; and then,\ncuriosity taking the upper hand, he followed the Doctor's example and\ntook to his heels.\n\nThe hamper was so heavy and large, and Jean-Marie himself so little and\nso weary, that it had taken him a great while to bundle it upstairs to\nthe Desprez' private room; and he had just set it down on the floor in\nfront of Anastasie, when the Doctor arrived, and was closely followed by\nthe man of business.  Boy and hamper were both in a most sorry plight;\nfor the one had passed four months underground in a certain cave on the\nway to Acheres, and the other had run about five miles as hard as his\nlegs would carry him, half that distance under a staggering weight.\n\n'Jean-Marie,' cried the Doctor, in a voice that was only too seraphic to\nbe called hysterical, 'is it--?  It is!' he cried.  'O, my son, my son!'\nAnd he sat down upon the hamper and sobbed like a little child.\n\n'You will not go to Paris now,' said Jean-Marie sheepishly.\n\n'Casimir,' said Desprez, raising his wet face, 'do you see that boy, that\nangel boy?  He is the thief; he took the treasure from a man unfit to be\nentrusted with its use; he brings it back to me when I am sobered and\nhumbled.  These, Casimir, are the Fruits of my Teaching, and this moment\nis the Reward of my Life.'\n\n'_Tiens_,' said Casimir.\n\nPRINTED BY\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO.
