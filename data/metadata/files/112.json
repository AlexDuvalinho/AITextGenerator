I originally intended that it be ready before the new\nyear, but alas, it came in behind schedule, and was not completed until\nJanuary.  It is still winter in some places--the right season for such\nmorsels--so rather than let the work languish upon the shelf for\nanother year...\n\nSomewhere out there on The Net, I hope there is a solitary reader\nsettled comfortably in a warm study with a nice cup of tea.  Perhaps\nthe lights are out, and the amber glow of the terminal spreads faint\nwarmth through the room; overstuffed bookshelves loom behind in the\ndarkness.  If the evening air is crisp and a soft snow is falling\noutside the window, so much the better--a view of icicles would be a\nmagical touch.\n\n                     -- Richard McGowan\n                        San Jose, California\n                        January 22, 1994\n\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\n                             VIOLISTS\n\n                        by Richard McGowan\n                            (Opus 22)\n\n                    1.

Christmas Concert\n\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\n\n                     GRETCHEN IN THE LIBRARY\n\n\n\nIn winter the interior of the university library was hardly warmer than\nthe outside, and it was terribly drafty.  The sole difference between\nthe interior and exterior, Gretchen often remarked to herself, was that\nthe latter received an occasional snow.  The library at least was dry.\nOn most days in the unfrequented areas--the closed stacks on the second\nand third floors--one could see one's breath in the middle of the\nafternoon.  Gretchen thought it hardly the sort of climate she would\nhave chosen for her own books.  But the cost of heating such an\nenormous building--well, she decided she could hardly imagine so\nextravagant a sum.  On the coldest days, she often wore two petticoats.\nShe found the best method of staying warm, though, was to bustle as\nquickly as she could.  Primarily, she worked in the stacks, extracting\nbooks for the library's patrons and reshelving books that had\nreturned--and keeping the shelves in good order.\n\nGretchen's twenty-ninth birthday had arrived--quite too quickly--the\nday before, and she bustled with an excess of alacrity to relieve her\nmind from the brooding that had occupied her for several days.  She had\nspent the evening alone, though she knew it did her no good to seek\nsolitude.  To accept being past her prime of life would be simpler\nperhaps, and productive of less anguish, than fretting over what could\nnot be changed.  She was nearly thirty, though--and she knew what lay\nin store for her a few years hence.  She had only to look at the\nassistant reference librarian, Miss Sadie, to see how she herself would\nbe in but a few more years.  The thought nearly made her shudder, and\nif she allowed herself to think too deeply upon the matter, might have\nbrought her to tears.  Thankfully, Gretchen told herself, she could\ngrow old among the books, where at least she had the company of great\nminds--or their legacy--rather than spend a life straining in a\nfactory--or under the yoke of an old-fashioned man.\n\nShe had been estranged from her family for six years and rarely given\nthem serious thought since fleeing Connecticut.  A simple enough row it\nhad been to start--what should she do now that she had finished\nuniversity?  Of course her father recommended marriage and settling\ninto the domestic life--a pretty girl like her.  Him and his antiquated\nideals--a pretty girl in the kitchen, indeed!  At twenty-three she had\nfinally come to her senses and refused to marry the young man to whom\nshe had been betrothed, no matter how well matched her father thought\nthey were.\n\nHer mother had frequently confided to Gretchen her views on the varied\npleasures--and trials--inherent in marriage, admitting that as the\nyears passed she found the pleasures perhaps not worth the other\nhardships--the outward subjugation of her own feelings and the constant\ndeference she was required to display within the confines of that\nmarriage, as if she had no independent mind.  Gretchen had long since\ndetermined that would not be her fate.  She had come to believe that no\nsuitable man could be found, yet she remained unsatisfied.  The only\ntrue regret she had about casting off her family ties was that she had\ndisappointed her mother.  It was her mother who had worked so hard,\nreally, to see that Gretchen had an education; her father only\nbegrudgingly went along for the sake of domestic tranquility when all\nefforts to dissuade her had failed.\n\nAt university Gretchen had imbibed the rarefied intellectual atmosphere\nwith increasing eagerness and found herself drawn irresistibly up the\nslopes of Parnassus.  She had always intended to work after completing\nuniversity--and work she did, though she had difficulty making due with\nwhat employment she could find.  Even a superlative education, she had\nlearned in six years, did not buy one certain rights or reasonable\nwages.  She hoped that she would yet see the flowering of an age that\nshe could call an enlightened one.  She might have been bitter had she\nhigher material aspirations, but she was content with little in the way\nof physical comforts.  Why the privilege of spending nearly all her\ndays in the library would have been worth almost any sacrifice--what\nneed had she of wages!\n\nIt was lamentable, she decided, that she should have to forgo marital\ncompanionship if she were to retain her individuality--for the price of\nher freedom was a monumental sort of loneliness that only the severest\nmental discipline could overcome.  She had seen so many of her school\nfriends smothered in the clutches of bad marriages, worn out beneath\ntheir husbands' heels--almost like doormats.  To be truthful there were\nthose who seemed to prosper in the state of matrimony, but she thought\nthem few.  Yet, she still had an abiding fear that she would grow old\nalone--and soon enough become as obdurate as Miss Sadie--a pitiable\nspinster with none of the finer sensibilities left to her.  Was there\nno man, Gretchen wondered, with whom she could share her life and\ninterests--a man with progressive ideas?  Not a man that she, like a\ntiny moon, would orbit eternally, but one with whom she could find a\nstate of mutual orbit.  Well, she thought, something of that nature\nanyway.  Her knowledge of astronomy was not up to the task of finding a\nbetter analogy, and she resolved to remedy that as soon as she was\nable.  She added another volume--'something concerning the heavens' she\ncalled it--to the list of books she thought she really must read.\n\nGretchen bustled, thinking these thoughts, dreading her next birthday.\nShe blew softly on a wisp of auburn hair that had somehow escaped from\nthe green ribbon with which she tied it back that morning.  Several\nstrands had somehow got into her mouth but her arms were too full of\nbooks--heavy tomes, all--to pull them away with her fingers.  She was\non the verge of setting down the burden and tending to her hair for a\nmoment when, as she turned a corner into the next row, a shadow fell\nacross the topmost book in her arms.  She glanced up in surprise.  A\nman stood mere inches in front of her--and looked up to find her\nbearing down upon him with a full head of steam--even as he stepped\ntoward her.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, attempting to stop herself.  The books slid\nirretrievably from her grasp, their pages flying open with a flutter.\n\nThe man's arms shot out.  \"The books!\" came his cry of astonishment as\nthey tumbled about him.  He tried to catch a few, left and then right,\nbut alas they fell--all but one--to the floor with a dull clatter.\n\n\"Oh dear,\" Gretchen whispered, looking down.  She feared she had bent a\nfew pages, and putting a hand to her mouth knelt immediately to gather\nthem all.  \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she continued in a rush as she\npiled books one after the other.  \"My clumsiness...\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it, Miss,\" the man replied lightly.  \"It's my fault.\nI do hope _you_ were not harmed by _my_ clumsiness...\" He knelt then,\nand began to place books upon her stack, starting with the volume he\nhad saved from falling.  The lucky book was one of the late Mr.\nDarwin's, and when he glanced momentarily at the spine she blushed\ndeeply despite herself--for she had that day finished reading it, and\nwas returning it to its rightful place.  She knew that he had seen her\ncheeks color.\n\nGretchen looked around, and seeing there were no more stray books,\nprepared to pick up the stack again.  She stood up to catch her breath\nand smooth her wool skirt, arching back her shoulders.  Looking down at\nthe man, she finally remembered to blow the wisp of hair from her face.\nHe was looking up at her and positively beaming--clean-shaven and light\ncomplected, she noted--but the smile faded almost instantly to a faint\ncurling about the corners of his lips.\n\n\"Please accept my apologies,\" he stated, still kneeling upon the floor.\n\"I will have to be more careful.\"  His hair was dishevelled--great\ncurly locks of jet black, and he laughed nervously as he brushed it\nfrom his eyes.  He peered at her with eyes so black, yet so kindly,\nthat Gretchen found herself blushing again and put a hand to her chest.\nThe man stopped for a moment to adjust his shirt and coat, then stood\nslowly, and with the hint of a bow, swept past her and away.\nUnaccountably, she felt suddenly light-headed and sat down upon the\nfloor by her books.  His eyes! she exclaimed to herself with an outrush\nof breath.  She felt that in an instant they had devoured her; had\nknown all about her.  She could not recall ever having seen such lively\nand intelligent eyes--so deep and black they seemed like windows\nopening onto a starlit sky.  And his hand! when he placed the last book\nupon the stack--the nails so trim.  His hands were almost feminine, and\nfinely wrought.  Gretchen gradually composed herself, then picked up\nher books and continued about her work.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nSeveral times thereafter in the course of a fortnight Gretchen saw the\nsame young man about the library, and they developed an acquaintance\nthat began and ended with nodding pleasantly and wishing each other\n\"good day\".  She thought him quite the most interesting patron she had\nseen in the library for... she knew not how long--perhaps never in the\ntwo years she had been there.  He was flamboyant, certainly, Gretchen\ndecided, but he had not that rakishness or arrogance that so often\naccompanies one who is as smart a dresser as he seemed.  Her thoughts\nchanced to light upon him sometimes, and within the fortnight, she\ndecided he must be attached to the university.  Perhaps a\nprofessor--well certainly not a full professor, he was far too young\nand had not grown into that masculine stuffiness that comes with long\ntenure--and his physique was trim.  No, she decided, he was probably a\nfresh young assistant to an elder professor.\n\n\"Gretchen, dear.\"  Miss Sadie's voice crackled behind her in a very\nstrange manner and Gretchen looked around.  \"I do fear I'm catching\nsome contagion, dear,\" Miss Sadie continued in a whisper, \"can you\npossibly mind the desk until closing?\"\n\nGretchen hesitated for a moment.  She had worked long enough in the\nlibrary to feel at ease, and with classes already in recess for the\nChristmas holidays, there were few patrons.  \"Of course, Miss Sadie,\"\nshe answered.  \"I do hope you're feeling better tomorrow.\"\n\n\"If not, I shan't be in,\" Miss Sadie replied in a very weak tone.\n\"I'll--I'll try to send word.\"\n\n\"I'll see to everything, Miss Sadie--just take care of yourself.\" She\npaused.  \"And I'll inform Mr. Johnson--it's no trouble at all.\" With a\nsmile and a pitying wag of her head, she added, \"Take good care of\nyourself.\"\n\nMiss Sadie thanked her, and took her leave.  Gretchen was alone, at\nlast, if only for an evening, as temporary queen of the reference desk.\nWell, it was about time she was asked to do something besides fetch\nbooks, she thought airily, and took a seat at Miss Sadie's desk.  Miss\nSadie was not very neat for a librarian, she thought, wiping a finger\nacross the desk, so she began to tidy a few things up.  She put down a\nfresh blotter and arranged the papers in a more orderly manner, then\nopened a drawer in search of a cloth.  Really, Miss Sadie is the\nepitome of disorganization, she muttered, seeing the jumble.  It's a\nwonder that a woman like her can retain such a position.\n\nBing-bing!  Gretchen looked up suddenly when the bell upon the front\ncounter sounded.  Standing there with his hand poised above the bell\nwas the young man.\n\n\"May I be of assistance?\"  Gretchen asked, in her most librarian-like\ntone.\n\nThe young man smiled.  \"I sincerely hope you can.  I wonder if you\nmight be able to help me find this book?\"  He held out a small slip of\npaper between two fingers.  \"It doesn't appear to be in the open\nstacks.\"\n\nGretchen glided to the desk and took the slip of paper from him.  A\nglance at the number was sufficient.  \"You're correct,\" she told him,\nhanding the paper back.  \"It's in one of the special collections.\"\n\n\"I wonder, then, Miss...\"  He paused, drawing out the word into a\nsilence, until Gretchen felt obliged to fill the audible gap.\n\n\"Haviland,\" she offered in a whisper.\n\n\"Miss Haviland.  Could you help me locate it?\"  He smiled with the\nslightly curling lips he always wore.  Not condescending, she\ndecided--perhaps amused, or even flirtatious.\n\nGretchen stood flustered for a moment.  Patrons were not allowed into\nthe special collections--they were under lock and key.  Should she\nleave the reference desk unattended while she fetched it for him? In\nthe interim, what if another patron had pressing business?  A\npreposterous quandary, Gretchen then told herself.  \"Of course,\nProfessor,\" she replied crisply.  \"Let me bring the key.\"\n\nThe young man laughed then, with a toss of his head so that his black\ncurls flopped into his eyes.  He suddenly sighed, with an exaggerated\nlook of defeat, brushing back his hair.  \"Do I appear so like a\nprofessor, Miss Haviland?  How did you know?\"\n\nIt was Gretchen's turn to be amused, and she smiled as she went to Miss\nSadie's desk drawer to bring the key.  \"You have not the air of a\nstudent, Professor...\"  she drew out the word in a manner imitative of\nhis previous query, until he had to break into a wondrous smile.\n\n\"Bridwell!\" he exclaimed, and rapped four fingernails once upon the\ndesk.  \"Employed only this year--in the English department.\"\n\n\"Professor Bridwell,\" she continued, imparting a certain air of\ncoquetry to her words, \"your dress is frankly too punctilious for a\nstudent; and if I might be so tactless, you seem... more evolved, shall\nwe say.\"\n\nHaving drawn out the key, she beckoned him to follow.  They ascended\nthe back staircase--likewise taboo for patrons.  All the while Gretchen\nthought how to exonerate herself should she be caught by one of her\nsuperiors while leading a patron--alone--into the inner sanctum.  She\ndecided the best approach would be to plead ignorance--\"Oh,\" she could\nsay, \"I had no idea that professors were considered ordinary patrons.\"\nWould that be sufficient excuse?\n\nThe book was easy to find, and Gretchen put herself to no particular\ndifficulty--but nevertheless, Professor Bridwell's thanks were profuse.\nHe consulted the book--which could not leave the library--for an hour\nor more.  On departing he returned the book to the counter.  He\ninclined his head, with the now-familiar flop of his curly hair, and\nsaid, \"I do hope to have the pleasure again, Miss Haviland.\"\n\nGretchen watched from Miss Sadie's desk as he departed through the\nfoyer and down the steps leading out.  She closed her eyes for a moment\nand sat quietly after he had left--simply savoring the moment.  A faint\nscent lingered behind him:  a distinctive cologne that left quite a\nfavorable impression on her.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nGretchen attended a short afternoon concert on campus.  It was the last\nstudent recital of the season, and she had heard tell of the program:\nthe afternoon was to open with mazurkas by Chopin and a selection of\nthose divine \"Transcendental Etudes\" by Liszt--she could not stay away.\nChopin was an aperitif, followed by a few mildly diverting piano works\nby students.  Then, she sat breathless and transported--utterly\ntransported, halfway to tears upon a bed of clouds--through the etudes\nof Liszt.  In particular she had never heard the \"Harmonies du Soir\"\nmore beautifully rendered.\n\nAfter an intermission, which she spent simply sitting quietly,\npondering the exquisite delicacies of Liszt's piano writing, the second\npart of the concert opened with Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\", performed\nby an intimate ensemble rather than with the full complement of\nstrings.  The performers were students, to be sure, but she found it\ndelightful nonetheless.  When the \"Autumn\" season opened, she even felt\na sudden chill in the air--the performance was so wonderfully\neffective--and she pulled her shawl more tightly around her shoulders.\nShe chanced then to look across the audience, and thought that several\nrows down, in front of her, she saw Professor Bridwell.  She had no\nidea he liked concerts; in fact, she realized that she knew nothing\nwhatever about him.  She was positive it was the professor--even from\nthe back, there was no mistaking his curly hair.  At once she realized\nthat he rather resembled portraits of Hector Berlioz.  He sat upright,\nalmost leaning forward in a posture that seemed ready to rise in an\ninstant.  She fancied that could she but see his handsome face, his\neyes would be closed, as he was carried away by the music, blown upon\nVivaldi's autumn wind.  Why she was looking at the audience rather than\nat the orchestra she really did not know--she forced her gaze away from\nthe professor's back and tried to concentrate again upon the music.\nBut her effort was unsuccessful.\n\nWhen the concert was ended, Gretchen fairly ran to the exit, and stood\nthere at the door, looking back across the auditorium.  Yes, it was he,\nshe saw finally.  He was coming up the aisle and she glimpsed his face\namong the swarm of bodies.  He appeared to be alone; he spoke to\nnobody.  She stepped out of the way and kept looking across the\naudience, as if seeking someone else.  He soon arrived, and when he\nwalked past, she turned and looked at him, as if suddenly noticing him\nfor the first time.\n\nHis smile was as delightful as always.  \"Good evening, Miss Haviland,\"\nhe said, with a tone of warmth.\n\n\"Good evening, Professor.\"  Gretchen thought that he slowed for a\nsecond or two, but she felt acutely embarrassed to be observing him too\nclosely, and looked away toward the crowd again.  He continued walking.\n\nWhen the professor had passed, Gretchen let out her breath slowly.\nInto the thick of the crowd she plunged, and went out through the\nlobby.  Evening had come on and it was dark outside.  Vast hordes were\ndispersing across the plaza, pouring from the auditorium.  As she\nstepped into the bitterly chill air and started down the stairs, a\nvoice hailed her from behind.\n\n\"Are you alone, then, Miss Haviland?\"\n\nGretchen whirled around at the sound of the professor's voice, in time\nto see him laugh briefly.  He was standing just outside the doors,\nfacing outward, his greatcoat pulled tightly around himself.\n\nGretchen went to stand on the step below.  \"Actually, yes,\" she\nreplied, looking up.  \"I am alone.  I came by myself on a whim.\"\n\n\"It's quite chilly this evening,\" he said, stepping down once.  They\nstarted down the stairs beside each other.  \"Would you fancy a cup of\ncoffee, by chance, before making your way home?\"\n\nGretchen smiled.  He certainly had a forward manner; but she found it\nrefreshing, and--after all, she had really been seeking him, had she\nnot?  \"Why, that sounds like a delightful diversion, Professor.  I\nbelieve I shall.\"\n\nWith that, they set off together across the plaza.  Gretchen started\nimmediately upon a likely topic of conversation:  the concert they had\njust attended.  It was instantly evident that Professor Bridwell had\nfound the Liszt etudes as breathtaking as she had.  And during the\nVivaldi, as well, he agreed that he had felt a sudden chill at\nprecisely the same time as she.\n\n\"The ensemble did well,\" she concluded.  \"I suppose that is the way\nVivaldi would have heard the work too--none of these large, modern\norchestras quite out of proportion to the delicacy of the music.\"\n\n\"The modern orchestra,\" stated the professor, \"is well enough suited\nfor modern works, but really, the intimacy required for performing\nearlier works--as Vivaldi for instance--is really lost in the great\ncrowd of strings.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\nPresently they came to the campus gates and found their way to a small\ncafé.  Seated at a tiny marble table, they had a delightful\ntête-à-tête, and found much to agree upon regarding both the\nperformance, and the subject of music in general.  Though he had not\nquite her madness for Liszt, he agreed with Gretchen's assessment of\nthe \"Transcendental Etudes\"--divinely inspired, and, like much of\nLiszt's work, nearly beyond the reach of mortals.\n\nGretchen was on her second coffee and feeling rather giddy.  She could\nhardly hold her cup steady, and she finally set it down with a laugh.\n\n\"Do you play an instrument, Professor?\" she asked, pushing her cup away\nwith one hand.\n\n\"Well, I would not so much call it playing the instrument,\" he\nanswered, \"as playing _at_ the instrument.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she laughed.  \"Rather the way I play _at_ the viola--though I\ndaresay you speak of Liszt's writing as if you have some experience\nwith it.\"\n\nThe professor seemed rather at a loss for an instant.  He glanced away\nover Gretchen's shoulder, but recalled himself quickly and lifted his\ncup to his lips, meeting her eyes again.  \"I do admit I have _tried_.\"\nHe set his cup down while reaching into his vest pocket, as if\nsearching for something.  \"But really,\" he continued, \"I haven't the\ntechnique.  How about yourself, Miss Haviland?  I take it you do rather\nwell yourself, upon the viola.\"\n\nGretchen blushed, realizing that she must have sounded boastful just\nthen.  The professor seemed not to have taken it in stride--she\nrealized that this must have accounted for his momentary loss for\nwords.  \"Well,\" she said then, settling herself forward upon her chair.\n\"At one time--when I was quite young, you understand--I fancied I would\nperform upon the instrument.  But...\"\n\n\"Ah.\"  Professor Bridwell smiled.  \"Then, other interests swept you\naway, no doubt.  But still you play?\"  He had pulled a silver cigarette\ncase from his vest pocket, and he turned it over in his fingers.\n\n\"Oh, indeed.\"  Gretchen sighed deeply.  \"I suppose, with all modesty\nset aside, I was adequate on the instrument--but adequacy in a\nperformer is hardly to be tolerated...\"  Before he could reply, she\nrushed onward, feeling her face flush.  \"I certainly do not practice\nwith any regularity of late!\"\n\nProfessor Bridwell laughed.  \"I daresay--at our time of life--leisure\nhours seem so unobtainable...\"  He looked at his cigarette case,\npolishing it with a thumb.  Seeming to think better of smoking just\nthen, however, he returned the case to his vest pocket.\n\nGretchen's smile was thin.  She inclined her head, acknowledging the\ntruth of what he said--they were indeed probably of an age.  Certainly,\nshe thought he could be no more than thirty-three or thereabouts.\n\"Then, too, music, while an engaging diversion, and the source of much\nhappiness, is better shared, wouldn't you say Professor?\"  He nodded\nslightly, and Gretchen clarified her statement.  \"That is to\nsay--practicing is all very well, but...the joy of music is in sharing\nit with one's friends--musical soirées and evenings in the parlor with\na roaring fire.  Old friends gathered around the piano--and\nchampagne!--\"\n\nProfessor Bridwell warmed to her words, and rubbed his hands together\nas if before the very fire she had mentioned.  \"You have hit it\nprecisely,\" he replied with enthusiasm.  \"Why--it's no wonder that\nliving, as I do, alone in a house that I fear is far too large for...\"\n\nGretchen thought she detected the professor falter just then, and there\nwas the slightest of pauses in his speech.\n\n\"... For myself alone, you see,\" he finished.  He laughed at himself,\ntossing the black mop of hair to one side.  \"But I needed some place\ninstantly when I arrived here.  I will probably find smaller digs in a\nyear or so, when I've come to know the city more intimately.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Gretchen answered, returning his smile.  \"I quite understand\nhow one needs permanent lodgings--the more quickly one can find them in\na strange city, why, the quicker one is able to settle into life, get\none's bearings in a foreign port.\"\n\n\"So true,\" he replied with a firm nod.\n\nA few moments later, a juncture seemed to have been reached in their\nconversation.  Their coffees were at an end, and neither of them had\ntouched their cups for what seemed ages, so engaged had they become in\ntheir conversation.\n\n\"But now,\" Professor Bridwell exclaimed, with a glance to his pocket\nwatch, \"I should not be keeping you away from your supper or--or your\nother duties any longer.  Please allow me to escort you home, Miss\nHaviland--or where you may be going.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Professor--but really there is no need,\" she declared.  She\nthought that sounded too firm, and she smiled easily, to show that she\nmeant it only literally, not as a rebuff.  \"My rooms are close by, and\nthe evening air will do me good, you see.  It shan't take me more than\nten minutes at a brisk pace.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed.  \"I believe I shall walk myself.  The air is good for\nthe circulation, as long as one's pace is brisk.\"\n\nGretchen rose, and took a curtsey.  The Professor held her coat and\nstood attentively while she donned her gloves.  \"I do thank you most\nkindly for the enchanting evening, Professor Bridwell.  It--it has been\nmarvelous.\"\n\n\"Likewise, Miss Haviland.  I sincerely hope we shall have the pleasure\nagain soon.\"\n\nWith a few more words of parting, Gretchen stepped into the street,\nfollowed by Professor Bridwell, and they went their separate ways.  She\nfancied that he stood in the street and gazed at her until she turned\nthe next corner, but she dared not glance back.  The evening was\nextremely cold, though not overcast, and her wool coat, even with a\nshawl wrapped beneath, did not keep the chill from seeping into her\nbones.  She rarely wore hats, but that evening she wished she had\none--one of those large fur hats so favored in Russia, she\nthought--that would be most appropriate, since she could pull it down\naround her ears.  By the time she arrived at her rooming house a few\nminutes later, she was shivering.  She undressed and went straight to\nbed beneath layers of feather comforters with a hot water bottle\npressed against her chest.  She had no appetite for supper, and\nresolved to arise early and eat a hearty breakfast to compensate.\n\nSleep was elusive in the extreme, but Gretchen found herself strangely\ndelighted that she could not sleep, for she had the leisure to think\nover in detail all that had happened that day.  And especially, she had\ntime to ponder her interlude with Professor Bridwell.  He was a most\nintriguing man.  He was a professor of English Literature--well, that\ncould mean almost anything, she supposed--yet he did not have that\n_way_ about him.  Nearly every professor of English she had ever\nmet--and a good many students of literature as well--were continually\nspouting clever quotes gleaned from the works of obscure authors,\nliving and dead--they were not particular about that.  It often seemed\nto her that the more obscure the quotation, the more it was admired\namongst their cronies.  She had always found such practices revolting.\nBut Professor Bridwell was not at all like that.  Why, the entire\nevening--and it had been two hours in fact that they had sat over cups\nlukewarm coffee--he had never quoted an author, famous or otherwise.\nYet, his choice of words, his demeanor, the hint of some foreign\ninfluence in his accent--the way he talked of Liszt--all pointed to an\nintimacy with the most literate form of the English language.  Through\nclear thoughts and meticulous expression--rather than through\nhaphazardly quoting other men--he exuded what she believed was a real\nprofessorial air, built upon a solid foundation without pretense.  She\nfound him refreshingly attractive, both for his own sake and as a\nchange from the pompous professors she encountered so often in the\nlibrary.  As she drifted into sleep, the hot water bottle pressed\nagainst herself, she hoped she would have the opportunity for another\nsuch conversation with Professor Bridwell.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nGretchen's cart of books was extraordinarily loaded.  Rather than push\nit slowly between the stacks as she reshelved books, she stopped the\ncart at the end of each row and carried a few books at a time to their\nproper places.  The library was more quiet than usual, and despite the\noverwhelming number of books she had to replace that day she worked\nrather slowly.  Lost in thought, she hummed to herself, not so loudly\nthat any patron who happened to be about could hear, but loud enough\nfor her own amusement.  She had just returned to the cart and pushed it\nto the next row.  She lifted another armful of books, choosing those\nwhose home was in that particular row, and turned to walk slowly,\nwatching the numbers.  She glanced at each book when she shelved it,\nlamenting that she had too little time that day--there could be no\nstolen moments of reading, even briefly.  She stood on her toes to\nreach an upper shelf and stopped humming for a moment.  The sound of a\nfootfall reached her at that instant, and she gave the book a quick\nshove.\n\n\"Good day, Miss Haviland.\"\n\nGretchen looked around to see a fine pair of wool trousers, as she\nreturned her weight fully to her feet.  Following upward with her eyes,\nshe felt a pleasant blush. \"Professor Bridwell, you startled me!\" she\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Careful,\" he returned, reaching his hand above her head.  Gretchen\nlooked up to see that he pushed the book further onto the shelf; she\nhad left it precariously tottering on the edge.  \"You almost lost one,\nMiss Haviland.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" she laughed, and grasped the rest of the books more securely\nto her chest.  She continued to walk easily down the row, with her wool\nskirt swinging about her ankles.  \"Is there a book I can help you\nfind?\" she asked, whirling toward him like a schoolgirl.\n\n\"Actually,\" the professor said, nervously drawing out the word.  \"I've\nnot come in a--a professional capacity at all today.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"  Gretchen turned to look at him, but kept walking.  With her free\nhand, she extracted a strand of hair from her mouth.\n\n\"The other evening--at coffee,\" he said, taking up the pace beside her.\n\"Well, really, I found the conversation most delightful and...\"\n\n\"Yes?\"  Gretchen stopped, then knelt to shelve another book, lower down.\n\n\"And I was wondering,\" he continued rather quickly, as if he dare not\nspeak of it, \"whether you might consent to dine with me this evening.\"\n\nGretchen stood up, rather slowly.  \"I--well...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the professor stammered, \"of course--such short notice.  I\nunderstand.  It's hardly proper, and I'm sure you're quite busy.\nPerhaps another time.\"  He stepped backward as if to take his leave.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Gretchen said with a faint smile.  She clutched the heavy\nbooks more tightly in her arms.  \"I should be delighted, really.\"  She\ncaught his eye then, and saw it twinkle.  The sight of his smile could\nnot but make her return it fully.  \"The other evening, it did seem\nthere was ever so much more to say.\"  She continued down the row, with\nProfessor Bridwell beside her.\n\n\"Is that an acceptance?\"\n\nShe laughed and stopped to face him squarely, as if astonished.  \"Why,\nI believe it is, Professor.\"  She blinked her eyes.  The sudden blush\nin his cheeks was profound, and she composed herself to keep from\nlaughing.\n\n\"Would six o'clock be too late?  Or too early?\"\n\n\"Neither, Professor.\"  Gretchen thought he looked as if he had been\nhanded a Christmas goose.  \"I'll meet you at the main entrance.\"\n\n\"Stupendous!  I'll...\"  He still sounded incredulous, and seemed near\nto bursting.  He pushed his black locks from his eye, and twisted a\nlock on one finger.  \"I'll meet you at six then?\"\n\nThey took their leaves of each other, and Gretchen thought she heard a\nfaint whistling in the main stairwell as the sound of his boots on the\nstone steps receded.  She flew to her cart immediately the sound died\naway in the distance.  Her unflagging concentration would be required\nif she were to be finished by six--she had seven more cartloads of\nbooks, and less than five hours in which to reshelve them all.  She did\nnot stop or rest until five forty-five, when she bid Miss Sadie good\nevening, and made her way to the main entrance.  She stood inside the\ngreat oak doors, under stone arches where she could see the professor\nthrough the glass when he approached.  With a few moments to ponder and\ncatch her breath while she waited, a sudden flutter filled her bosom.\nGood Lord, she thought to herself--it's a wonder he did not think me\nscandalously forward.  She felt a faint tingling in her cheeks as if\nshe had begun to color.  What sort of woman would join a stranger for\ndinner with five hours notice?  Part of her dared not even answer her\nown question, but another part of her replied that he was not a perfect\nstranger by any means--she had met him any number of times--and had\njoined him for coffee with no notice at all.  It was hardly the time to\nstart worrying about propriety.  She pulled the ribbon from her hair\nand brushed it before retying the ribbon carefully and flinging her\nhair behind her back.  The least I can do, she thought, is to make\nmyself halfway presentable, though it's a pity I haven't time to change\nmy coat.  A hat might have been welcome for its warmth--the evening was\nsure to be cold--and for fashion as well.  But then what is the use of\nseeming fashionable, she thought, if fashionable I am not?\n\nWith his arms wrapped closely around him and his ungloved hands tucked\nbeneath his arms, Professor Bridwell trotted up the stairs.  Upon\nseeing him, Gretchen pushed open the doors and stepped outside.\n\n\"Why it's cooler than I had thought,\" she remarked.\n\nThe professor's smile fairly warmed her heart.  \"Let's hurry along\nthen,\" he said between chattering teeth, \"I know just the place this\nevening.  They'll even have a fire, and if we're quick about it, we\nmight find a table close enough to feel its warmth.\"\n\nSide by side, they walked out through the plaza.  The clouds had\ndescended, muffling the sounds of the city beyond.  They continued\nthrough the campus gates into the nearby streets.  The neighborhood was\nuncrowded, since so many students had left for their holidays, and\nthough there were a few groups of people walking to and fro, dressed\nwarmly against the weather, only the occasional carriage rattled by.\nProfessor Bridwell led the way into a side street, where they were\ngreeted by a brightly lit café.\n\n\"I had no idea...,\" Gretchen began.\n\n\"Of a French café so near campus?\" the professor finished for her.\n\"It's quite new.\"  He pulled open the door and the sounds of bustling\ncrowds and gay voices greeted them.  \"I say,\" he continued, \"the place\nappears to have been discovered.\" Gretchen followed him in while he\nheld the door, and stood by removing her gloves while he conferred with\nthe head waiter.  She glanced up as she folded her gloves in time to\nsee the man wisk a bill into his apron pocket.\n\n\"Follow me, monsieur.\"\n\nThe professor took Gretchen's arm and led her along.  Their table was\nin the back and, as Professor Bridwell had hoped, it was close by an\nopen brick fireplace filled with a roaring blaze of crackling oak logs.\nShe sat in silent attendance while their waiter recited, in heavily\naccented English, a seemingly unending speech upon the specialities of\nthe house.\n\nGretchen lost the particulars mid-way, and her eyes strayed beyond him\nto the fire.  \"I'm quite overwhelmed,\" she exclaimed when he had\nfinished and stood poised before them.  \"Please--do what you think\nbest, Professor.\"\n\nProfessor Bridwell surprised her then, by leaning back with the casual\nair of one who knows what he is about, and held forth in what seemed,\nto Gretchen's ear, flawless French.\n\n\"Bravo, Professor,\" she chimed when he had finished.  \"Your French is\nbeautiful.\"\n\nThe professor seemed somewhat embarrassed then, and smoothly turned the\nconversation to the decor.  The room was hardly what Gretchen should\nhave expected of a French café--it was done in stark white, with high\nrafters of carved wood, but upon the walls hung gorgeously worked\nPersian carpets which served to bring the ceiling down and lend\nintimacy to the room; and to muffle the sound of so many conversing\nguests.  Their entrees arrived in due course--a delightful poached\nwhite fish in delicate sauce, which they ate practically in silence,\nbut for the occasional comment upon the food.  He asked after her\nhealth, and heard the small-talk of the day, then listened with\ninterest to an abridged account of her life, interjecting only\noccasional questions to clarify certain points.  She stopped short of\nrevealing the estrangement of her family, but dwelt upon her years at\nuniversity.\n\nGretchen at length noticed the emptiness of her plate and declared that\nthe fish positively melted in one's mouth.  Professor Bridwell replied\nthat he would send compliments to the chef.  His smile grew gradually\nas he said this, with a hint of something further he wished to add, but\nhe stopped.\n\n\"Was there something else?\" she asked, setting her silver carefully\natop her empty plate.\n\n\"No, nothing,\" he laughed, putting down his own silver.\n\nPresently, their plates were cleared away and the professor ordered a\nliqueur with coffee.  Gretchen declined a liqueur, having drunk enough\nwine already to raise her color slightly--she settled for coffee and a\nsmall gateau.\n\n\"You mentioned that you play the viola,\" he said, taking up his liqueur\nwith one hand.  \"Have you been playing long?\"\n\n\"Since I was sixteen,\" she replied, stirring cream into her coffee.  \"I\nbegan with the violin as a child--I really can't recall at what age.\nWhen I was sixteen I went away for a summer, and...\" she stopped to\nlook at him for an instant, tapping upon her gateau with her fork.\n\"Well, I met a young man who played the viola, and I was quite--quite\ntaken with his instrument.  It seemed to suit me, really.\"\n\n\"I would say it does,\" the professor agreed.  \"Unusual, especially for\na woman--mildly exotic even...and intriguing...\"\n\nThey continued conversing about the viola and the piano, telling each\nother about their favorite pieces, comparing composers.  Gretchen had\nnever played the piano seriously herself--she found it frustrating and\nwas amazed that anyone could master such an instrument.\n\n\"It requires such independence of the hands,\" she said.  \"I've tried,\nbut I could never play anything worth mentioning.  Oh, the organ is\nanother one that I simply cannot fathom.  Beautiful to hear, it's quite\ncomical to watch--and seems so awkward to play.\"\n\n\"Neither is really any more complicated than the viola, I should\nthink,\" the professor replied.  He had been twirling his glass for some\ntime, but he stopped and removed his hand from the table.  \"Think of\nthe dexterity required to control your bow, and the simultaneous\nimparting of vibrato while retaining correct intonation.  It's quite as\nremarkable.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean, certainly.  It all seems easy with long practice.\"\n\n\"Do you sing alto as well?\"\n\nShe laughed.  \"Very poor alto, Professor.\"\n\n\"But alto nonetheless.  I was certain you would sing alto.\" He sipped\nhis liqueur again and twirled the glass slowly.  \"What about opera?  I\ndespise Wagner myself.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Gretchen replied, reaching for her coffee.  \"I can't say I\ntruly enjoy Wagner's work, the little I have heard.  But Verdi--is\nluscious.\"\n\n\"Yes, Verdi.  I quite agree with your assessment.  And Mozart, of\ncourse, is beyond reproach.\"\n\n\"Positively.  But I generally prefer the intimacy of lieder myself.\"\n\n\"German?\"\n\nShe laughed and pointed her fork at him.  \"Not only German--chansons as\nwell.\"\n\n\"I'm relieved to hear it.\"  Professor Bridwell then put one hand into\nhis pocket, and withdrew his silver cigarette case.  \"Would you mind,\nMiss Haviland, if I smoke?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" she replied.\n\n\"Some ladies find it offensive,\" he said, opening the case slowly, \"but\nI find it the perfect finish to a delightful meal.\"\n\n\"I couldn't agree more.\"  Gretchen pushed away her plate--the gateau\nthough small, was simply too rich--and sat back upon her chair.\nCigarettes had always appealed to her, and she indulged on occasion\nherself--in private.  Cigars she could not abide, however, for they\nreminded her too much of her father's odious acquaintances--men who\ncame to play cards each week throughout her childhood.  \"If I might\nask,\" she said quietly, folding her hands the table, \"how do you feel\nabout women smoking, Professor?\"\n\nHe paused, with the open case upon the table before him and looked\nsteadily into her eyes.  \"Miss Haviland,\" he answered, \"we are living\nin an enlightened age, are we not?  Women's suffrage--and frankly, it\nwill happen soon, I'm sure.  University educations--such as your own.\"\n\nShe nodded, but let him continue.  He studied the top of the cigarette\ncase with some care.  From the side, a hovering waiter produced a\nshallow ashtray of white china and set it near his elbow.\n\n\"I have no objection,\" he continued, \"to a woman pursuing whatever\ntakes her fancy, provided she's reached majority.  The same as any\nman.\"  He fingered the cigarette case, closing and then opening it\nagain.  \"A strong and independent mind is an asset in anyone, male or\nfemale.\"  He looked up hesitantly.  \"You seem to have such a mind.\nYou've read Mr. Darwin, I believe--and I suspect other progressive\nthinkers as well.\"\n\nGretchen smiled at him, but tilted her head with some puzzlement.\n\n\"You once called me more evolved,\" he replied answering her unspoken\nquestion.  \"That's hardly the sort of phrase an unread woman would use.\nI presumed you have read Mr. Darwin, among others.\" He curled his lips\nupon seeing her amusement and continued speaking.  \"It is the mind, I\nbelieve--and the soul, if one is religiously inclined--that really\ndistinguishes man from the lesser animals.  Female no less than\nmale--we all possess that most human of traits.\"\n\nHis extensive reply was more favorable and pointed than she would have\nthought possible.  It pleased her, and confirmed a great deal that she\nhad sensed about him.  \"Then you won't mind at all if I join you?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" he returned without hesitation, holding the silver case\ntoward her.  She deftly removed a cigarette, and tamping it upon her\nfingernail twice, held it out for him to light.  She bent back her\nwrist and let it dangle between her long fingers while he lit his own\ncigarette.\n\n\"Now that we've learned all about me,\" she said, blowing a thin stream\nof smoke away, \"perhaps you'll tell me about yourself, Professor.\"\n\n\"Please,\" he said, setting the ashtray in the middle of the table, \"do\ncall me Antoine.  We needn't be so formal, I think.\"\n\nShe laughed quietly.  \"Antoine.\"\n\n\"My mother was French,\" he stated quietly.\n\nGretchen caught his use of the past tense, but did not inquire further.\n\"No doubt she is the source of your excellent French.\"\n\n\"Maman did speak French to me as a child--but my French is quite poor\nfor anything but domestic conversation.\"\n\n\"From what little I speak,\" she replied, drawing on her cigarette, \"you\nsounded quite fluent.\"  She let the smoke linger on her lips, then blew\nit away softly.\n\n\"Why thank you for the compliment...Miss Haviland.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" she said, realizing what she had neglected.  \"My Christian\nname is Gretchen.\"\n\n\"Gretchen Haviland,\" he repeated slowly.  \"That has quite a\nsatisfactory ring to it.\"\n\nShe complimented him on the quality of the tobacco when they were\nfinished smoking.  The hour was past nine o'clock, so they left the\ncafé and walked into the street.  The fog had descended, lower and\nthicker than before.  Occasional carriages appeared, rumbling quietly\nalong.  Tatters of mist blew sluggishly past the gaslights.\n\n\"I hope you shall allow me the pleasure of escorting you home this\nevening?\" he asked as they walked.\n\n\"I should be honored.\"\n\nHe held out his elbow, and she slipped her gloved hand over his\nforearm.  They walked in silence toward her rooming house, both\nenjoying the quiet of the evening.  It seemed much warmer than before,\nand Gretchen thought a snow was about to fall.  The air had the crisp\nscent of impending snow.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" Professor Bridwell said after a while, \"that you were\nnot busy this evening.  Surely you must have so many friends.  Other\nengagements.\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I have very few friends.  But\nsurely--Antoine--there must be any number of ladies who would be far\nbetter company...\"\n\n\"I'm too involved with my books, I fear.  Studying all the time;\npreparing lectures--while the ladies run off with younger rakes.\" He\nglanced at her with a teasing half-smile.  \"I'll be thirty-five come\nFebruary.\"\n\nGretchen laughed to hear him say such things.  But she was pleased that\nshe had guessed his age so nearly.\n\n\"I fear,\" he continued, \"it is my fate to attend concerts alone, and\nremain unwed all my life.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Gretchen replied, \"there's something sad in that then, is there\nnot?   Two studious people nearly of an age, with no other\nattachments.\"  She looked sidelong at him.  \"And with Christmas so\nnear...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he agreed, \"there is a bit of sadness in that.  Have you no\nfamily nearby, Gretchen?\"\n\n\"No, they're ALL in Connecticut--too far to visit this year, and my\nrooming house would hardly be suitable for inviting them to visit me.\"\n\nHe laughed pleasantly at this.  Yet she did not tell him that she was\nestranged from her parents.\n\n\"Besides my family being far away--at twenty-nine, one cannot be\nforever running home to one's parents, can one?\" she asked.\n\n\"I do understand that,\" he said.  \"Fancy the two of us then, alone for\nChristmas--it seems rather a shame.\"\n\n\"It does indeed,\" Gretchen answered looking away.  Snow had begun to\nfall, silently and hesitantly.  The flakes, drifting between the empty\nbranches of trees along the avenue, seemed as large as walnuts; as\nfluffy as eider down.\n\nThe professor laid his hand across Gretchen's gloved hand, suddenly\nholding her fingers delicately beneath his.  She smiled at him, looking\nat his eyes; his mop of black hair, now bedecked with great white\nsnowflakes.  They stopped walking for an instant, and she could see the\nwisps of mist curling away from his mouth as he opened his lips.  The\nstreet was silent.  He took a step toward her and she realized that she\nwas not looking far up into his eyes--he was not so much taller than\nherself as she had imagined.  She thought--suddenly aware of the\npalpitation of her heart--she found herself hoping he would kiss her.\nShe believed he would kiss her, just then, and she let out her hot\nbreath.  Mist escaped her expectant lips on the faintest of breezes.\n\nThey stood for a long moment, facing each other until he turned slowly\nand stepped forward.  Gretchen continued walking beside him with her\nhand upon his arm.  They crossed the street and at last were near her\nrooming house.  She looked up at the falling snow against a gray sky;\nthe tangle of branches above them; the misty pools of light beneath the\ngaslights.  She glanced at his serene face, turning, though she\ncontinued to walk.\n\n\"I believe you almost kissed me back there, did you not Professor?\"\n\n\"So, it's 'Professor' again, is it?\"  He smiled the faintest of smiles\nand looked away down the street.  \"Miss Haviland, you did not ask to be\nkissed--back there.\"  She turned quickly in front of him to catch his\ngaze, so that he had to stop.  \"Not in so many words,\" he added, \"I\nmean--you hesitated as much as I.\"\n\n\"Fancy that,\" she replied with a laugh, and began walking again,\nswinging her legs gaily, letting her skirt billow.\n\nHe touched her hand, draped over his forearm, and she felt the warmth\nof his fingers through her glove.  They walked on beneath bare branches\nand quietly falling snow.  It seemed far too warm for snow--tropical\nalmost, as if the gaslights were warming the whole scene--the whole\nworld.  Winter was about to melt--the sun might even rise the next\ninstant and spring would return in a blaze of gold and green with soft\nrain, the scent of flowers.\n\n\"In future, perhaps I _shall_ ask, Professor.\"  She leaned to grip his\narm more tightly and whispered.  \"Perhaps I shall.\"\n\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\n\n                     THE HUNGARIAN LIGHTBULB\n\n\nWhen the symphony orchestra collapsed in ruin after years spent\nfloating, half-dead near bankruptcy, all the musicians were thrown out\nof work.  At that time nearly everyone was out of work anyway--many of\nthem discovered soup-kitchens and soon found employment at menial\ntasks.  A few--the lucky or the talented, but mostly those with both\nluck and talent--found other musical work well below stevedore's wages.\n\nJurgen had tremendous talent but no luck, yet he could not imagine any\nother life than being a violist.  He would not look for non-musical\nwork--everything was unsuitable, and certainly unattractive.  He took\nthe little savings he had and went West thinking to find a place less\ncrowded with hungry musicians.  Rather than spend his money on\ntransportation he settled on a romantic adventure:  he made friends\naround the freight yards and rode the rails west until he arrived on\nthe outskirts of a comfortably large city with a clean look--and there\nhe decided to make his home.  The city was familiar to him, as a\nprofessional musician:  it boasted a fine orchestra whose conductor,\none Laurence Lamonte, frequently found shockingly intimate details of\nhis flamboyant life splashed across the pages of the tabloids.\n\nIn River Street, on the wrong side of the tracks, after hours spent\nwalking from the fashionable districts gradually down the economic\nladder into a grimy, dilapidated neighborhood, Jurgen found the\nCharleston Residence Hotel.  Brownstone, four stories tall, it had two\nwindows boarded up on the third floor and unmistakable blackened marks\nfrom a conflagration that had never been cleaned away.  There was a\nsign in the window advertising a weekly fee he thought he could\nmanage--if the sign was not out of date.  It was yellow, curling at the\nedges, and could hardly be read behind a smudged window laced with\nyears of accumulated cobwebs.  It did not seem like a wholesome\nplace--but the price was right so he walked into the tiny lobby.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" he asked.  He had his viola case tucked under one\narm and his cracked leather valise dangling from the other hand.\n\nA short, bearded and balding man in a brown, pinstriped suit that might\nonce have been new, stood at the front desk.  The stub of a stale cigar\nnot two inches long was stuffed between his lips.  He cupped a hairy\nhand to his ear.\n\n\"I asked,\" Jurgen stated in a much louder voice, \"whether you have a\nroom to let.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we got a lot of rooms.\"  The man grinned.  \"How many you want?\"\n\n\"One will be sufficient, thank you.\"  Jurgen carefully laid out one\nweek's rent on the counter.  \"This is a week in advance.\" The man\ncupped his hand to his ear, and Jurgen was compelled to repeat himself\nloudly.\n\nThe man swept the money away--into a vest pocket--and handed his new\nresident a rusty key attached to a length of twine.  Scrawled on a\npaper tag attached to the twine were numbers: a three, separated by a\ndash from the number thirteen.\n\n\"By the way,\" Jurgen inquired loudly, leaning forward, \"you don't mind\nif I PRACTICE the VIOLA during the DAY?\"\n\n\"Violin?\" the man yelled back, with a dismissing wave.  \"Just so I\ndon't get no complaints, you do what you want.\"\n\nRelieved at last to be in some lodging--his last few nights had been\nspent in damp freight cars, cowering with one or another group of\nindigents--Jurgen ascended the stairs quietly to the third floor.  Room\nthirteen was the last door on the right at the front of the building.\nHe opened the door after some fumbling with the key.  His room proved\nto be the one with boards on the windows.  Only one window, on the\nleft, was not boarded.  The inside had been freshly painted, with white\npaint.  The floor was painted a deep gray and partly covered with a\nthreadbare carpet patterned mostly in shades of brown.\n\nJurgen fumbled for the light switch and pushed it with a loud click.  A\nsingle bulb glowed dimly, suspended from a long wire in the center of\nthe room.  He thought that was par for the course.  At these rates, he\ncould not have expected much more.  Setting down his valise, he thought\nhe would be in better lodgings uptown, as soon as he found work.  He\nlaid his viola case reverently across the raw, wooden arms of the\nroom's single chair.  In the far left corner was a single bed.  It had\nno sheets, but a few worn blankets folded neatly at the foot of the\nmattress.  Along the opposite wall stood a sink with a cracked mirror\nhanging above it, a flush toilet with a broken ceramic handle, and a\ncloset door--again with a broken handle.  No towels.  Putting his\nvalise upon the bed, Jurgen went back down the stairs to see about\nsheets and towels.\n\n\"This is a residence hotel,\" the proprietor told him, pushing back the\nfew hairs on his head with one hand.  \"Sheets in the hall closet at the\nfar end--towels too.  Maid comes once a week.  Toss your sheets and\ntowels down the chute on Tuesday morning.  Don't use too many.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Jurgen replied, making a sincere effort at politeness.  He\nwent back up and got a set of sheets and a towel, then made his bed.\n\nAfterwards, he sat on the edge of the bed and opened his valise.  It\ncontained underwear, a well-used black suit with tails, a silk shirt, a\nsilk hat, soap and shaving kit, and sheaf after sheaf of printed music.\nEverything else he had sold as necessary; his cash was securely\nfastened around his waist in a money-belt.  He wondered if there were a\ntrustworthy bank in the neighborhood.  Tomorrow, he decided, he would\nhave to go look.\n\nJurgen surveyed the room carefully before turning in.  On the back of\nthe door a relatively new calendar was posted with two thumb tacks.  It\nfeatured a blonde woman with exquisite, long legs and a coquettish\nsmile--advertising a well-known brand of chewing tobacco.  It was the\nfourteenth of November, he noted.  Fifty-seven years ago to the day,\nhis grandmother had arrived in New York harbor from Hungary, dragging\ntwo young children behind her--with less money in her pocket than he\nhad.  He pondered her memory for a moment--she had been his first\nmusical mentor--then went to switch off the light.  He laid down on the\nbed beneath fresh cotton sheets and listened to the far-off sounds of\nthe city--automobiles and trains, mostly--until he fell asleep.\n\nEarly in the morning, just after sunrise, Jurgen practiced the viola\nquietly for an hour or so.  He had no clock, but when he judged, by the\nsounds in the street that the time was past ten, he left the hotel with\nhis viola case under his arm.  He spent the day wandering from\nstreet-corner to street-corner in a nearby business district along the\nriver-front and by late afternoon had earned enough money for two full\nmeals.  He played mostly Stephen Foster songs--everyone knew them and\nthey never failed to bring smiles.  Occasionally a nice old lady would\nstop, and blushing, ask whether he knew one or another of the favorite\ntunes of some prior season.  As often as not, he had never heard of the\ntune, but when he did know it, he laid into the instrument with such\nvigor that they always left a good fistful of coins in his open case.\n\nAt a nearby hash-slinging café where the cook had anchors tattooed on\nboth arms, Jurgen ate breakfast.  The waitress wore silk stockings\nbeneath a soiled uniform with pink and white stripes--and kept a pencil\nbehind each ear, both of them dull with their ends chewed.  Jurgen\nreflected with some amusement that his description could fit the people\nas well as the pencils.\n\nThe next several days passed in much the same manner.  Each evening,\nrather than hastily becoming a regular at any one café, Jurgen\npreferred to try all of the nearby places in the hope of finding the\nmost comfortable of the lot.  On Thursday evening he saw a small sign\nhe had never noticed before, though he had walked down the same street\nseveral times.  Neatly lettered by hand in blue upon a white ground--it\nsaid simply \"Calcutta\", with a downward pointing arrow.  Jurgen\ndescended the dark stairwell, passed one steel door tightly closed with\na padlock, and found the next door unlocked.  The same name was painted\non the door at eye level.  He pushed it open and walked in, thinking he\nmight have found a restaurant a bit more exotic than the typical run of\ncafés in the neighborhood.  The lighting was dim, the decor dark and\nspare.  The place was lined with booths near the door, but opened into\na space taken over by a checkerboard tiled floor.\n\nHe could see there were only a few customers--not more than five or six\npeople, all told.  He looked around slowly, holding his viola case\nunder one arm, the other hand laid across the top of it.  He was the\nonly white person in the establishment.\n\nNobody turned to look at him, but kept right on with what they were\ndoing--drinking and smoking, talking quietly.  It seemed comfortable\nenough--and he saw some things of interest at the far end of the room.\nThere were four tables at that end, under dim spotlights.\n\nJurgen walked slowly past the booths toward the spotlights.  A double\nbass sat on its side near the wall as if it were the subject of the\nspotlights' illumination--it might jump up and break into song any\nmoment.  An upright piano stood on the left, lurking warily in the\nshadows, its top opened like a gaping jaw.  Jurgen knew this all meant\nmusic, and he made his way between the tables to sit at the one nearest\nthe instruments.  It was partially shadowed; an unlit candle stood in\nthe middle of the round table--a square table-cloth in white and red\nchecks draped haphazardly, held in place by the candle.  Jurgen sat\nslowly on the nearest wooden chair, facing the music; it creaked when\nhe put his weight on it.  He set his viola case on the table and slid\nit over so he could rest his left elbow on it.\n\nHe felt something stir, and looked behind him.  A young woman in a\nsleeveless sky-blue dress approached out of the shadows.  Her hair was\npulled back tightly against her head, white teeth gleamed in her dark\nface.  She put one hand on the back of the nearest booth, and leaning\nupon it, spoke to him.\n\n\"What'll it be?\" she asked with quiet confidence.  Her chin rose when\nshe finished asking, and she tilted her head to one side, smiling.\n\nJurgen gazed at her--she had a pretty face with a narrow chin and\nstrikingly high cheekbones; her black eyes sparkled in the spotlight.\nHe did not really feel like drinking anything intoxicating.  \"Something\nsoft,\" he answered.  \"Something quite soft and preferably cool.\"\n\nShe nodded and shoved herself off gracefully, trailing one hand.\nJurgen waited in silence, staring at the back wall.  In a few moments,\nthe musicians--three black men in baggy workmen's clothing--returned to\nthe stage, gliding in stealthily, creeping from a door to one side.\nWithout a word, they sat down and took up their instruments.  The bass\nplayer heaved his double bass upright, then sat upon a high stool and\nplucked a few notes.  The third man carried a clarinet, and standing in\nthe center, whipped his fingers through a few scales without making any\nsound.  They stole a few glances at each other--then broke\nsimultaneously into a molten jazz number, hot as a blast furnace.\nJurgen sat back slowly in his chair.  The blazing tune crackled and\nsparked, then settled into a long, burning ember; he could feel the\nthin layer of ash building up around the coals until it gradually\nsettled into a warm mound of slow heat.\n\nThe young woman appeared with a Coca-Cola in a tall glass--Jurgen only\nglanced at her when she set it down, and returned his attention to the\nmusicians.  She slid past his table and strode under the center\nspotlight--the clarinetist moved to one side without missing a note,\nnodding at her.  She whirled around, snapped her fingers to pick up the\nslow beat--and launched into song, so softly at first, he was not sure\nshe was singing.\n\nHer voice soon rose in a solo, weaving in and out of the clarinet's\nmelody.  Flames rushed up to greet her voice--Jurgen felt the hairs\nrising on the back of his neck and across his scalp.  She sang without\nwords; low tones with all the plaintiveness of an English horn,\nblending into the ensemble; and at times her voice rose like a\nwhispering flute and broke into autumn leaves, tumbling in a light\nbreeze--the fire crackled behind her.\n\nThe splendor of it entranced Jurgen and he forgot his drink, putting\nboth elbows on the table to watch the woman sing.  Her voice was so\nrich, so well-trained and supple--he could have imagined her on the\nopera stage, singing mezzo-soprano.\n\nThe ensemble rushed to a climax that shattered like a glass against\nstone, and was silent.  There were applause from the dark café behind.\nJurgen could make out each individual in the audience--pitifully few\ncustomers to hear such a singer!  He applauded firmly, with authority,\nand continued until the last clap had died behind him; three more\ndecisive claps and he stopped.\n\nThe band played a few more numbers, standard blues fare and a popular\nshow-tune or two--the young woman sang, standing perfectly still with\nher eyes closed, alone beneath a spotlight.  She bowed at last, arms\noutstretched with a beautiful smile, and strode into the back.  The\nmusicians followed her out to take another break.\n\nThe pianist lagged behind, following the others to the door, then\nturned around and sat down at Jurgen's table, pulling his chair close.\nThe man had a few days' growth of beard.  He was completely\nbald--perhaps shaved, Jurgen decided--and his smile revealed one\nmissing tooth and two silver teeth.  When he spoke, his voice was deep\nand bubbly, like a slow pot of soup, simmering.  \"Don't get many o' yer\nkind here,\" he began.\n\nJurgen flushed suddenly and swallowed, feeling a sense of impending\npanic.  He gaped momentarily, unable to think of a reply.  Might it be\nprudent to withdraw?\n\nThe man sat back and laughed loudly, thrusting his thumbs into his\nbelt.  He thrust his head forward suddenly, grinning.  \"I mean--you\nplay that fiddle or jes set yer elbow on it?\"\n\nJurgen felt instantly relieved, and regained his composure.  \"Certainly\nI play it,\" he said, returning the man's smile with some hesitation.\n\n\"Maybe you'll play somethin' for me?  Maybe I'll buy yer drink, too.\"\n\n\"Well--I--I've never played much--any--jazz,\" Jurgen said slowly.\n\"Folk tunes, show-tunes--on rare occasions.  I'm a symphony violist, by\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the man answered, wrinkling his brow.  \"I see.  Well, it don'\nhave to be blue--jes wanna see what you got... If it ain't much\ntrouble?\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Jurgen pulled his viola case toward himself, and scooted his\nchair back to give himself some room.  He opened the case, strummed the\nstrings once to check the instrument's tuning--close enough, he\ndecided.  While he rosined his bow he tried to decide where he should\nstart.  He settled on a Hungarian folk tune his grandmother used to\nplay for him.  It had a homey, intimate quality; rather simple and\neasily manipulated.  He readied himself and then poured his heart into\nplaying that tune--he worked it around, swished it a few times, tried\nsome variations, caught the fever, and finished off with a fast\nspiccato variation.\n\n\"Sounds like gypsy music,\" the man said when he had finished.  \"Hot\nblood.\"\n\nJurgen smiled.  \"My grandmother--was Hungarian.\"\n\n\"Say,\" the man said, laying his hand atop the viola case, \"why don' you\njoin us awhile?  Play anything you like--jes name it.  We know 'bout\nmost anything.\"  He stood up and thrust out his hand.  \"My name's Al,\"\nhe concluded.\n\nJurgen clasped his hand. \"Jurgen.  A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Al.\"\n\nAl chuckled.  \"Nah, jes Plain Al.  Come on over here...\"\n\nWhen the other musicians returned, the young woman--Al introduced her\nas Mabel--sat at the table Jurgen had vacated.  He took one chair and\njoined the clarinetist under the spotlight.\n\n\"Do you know--uh...\" Jurgen paused.  \"How about 'Nice Work if You Can\nGet It'?\"\n\n\"Mmm.  George & Ira...,\" the clarinetist intoned reverently with a wide\ngrin.  \"Ever'body knows that one...\"\n\nThey played a seething rendition that soon had Mabel on her feet,\nimprovising alongside Jurgen.  She stood facing him, doubling over to\npeer into his eyes, undulating while they ran on in imitative\ncounterpoint, two fish in a creek spilling down a mountainside.  The\npiano and clarinet stopped while they took the tune up on their own,\nturning it over, peeking into all the hidden motives, each musically\nentwined in the other.  Mabel was breathless when they finished, and\nlet Plain Al take a solo before leading them all back into the\nmelody--Mabel broke into the last verse and belted it through the room.\nThere were pitifully few customers to applaud.\n\nThe place was closing up, and Al sat with Jurgen and the other\nmusicians around a table.  They each coddled a tall Coca-Cola mixed\nwith bourbon, and talked and talked, shooting answers and questions at\neach other like they were playing hot-potato.  They were all\nsemi-professional--none of them were paid for playing at Calcutta.\nMabel and her brother ran the place, under the eye of a kindly landlord\nwho never bothered them; he came in once or twice a month, sat through\na few songs, and left.  Mabel and her brother provided free food for\nanyone who wanted to play for the evening.  Times being what they were,\nthey could not afford to hire anyone to play--and had nothing else to\ndraw any clientele.  The musicians all held regular jobs, off and\non--mostly off, they admitted--and Calcutta was like their own private\nparadise, where they were real musicians, where people came to hear\nthem play.  They were a comfortable bunch, wiling away their evenings\nwith music, going home with full stomachs.\n\nJurgen felt exhausted--he had been up since dawn--and when he had\nfinished his drink, begged to take his leave.  He cradled his viola\ncase under one arm.  \"I'm wondering, Al,\" he said as he stood up.  \"How\nthis place came to be called 'Calcutta'?\"\n\nAl laughed.  \"That's Mabel's idea of jokin' I guess.  Mabel, she reads\na lot--got some fine schoolin' too.\"  Jurgen did not comprehend\nimmediately.  Al flashed his silver teeth and leaned forward with wide,\nlaughing eyes.  \"Black Hole o' Calcutta?\"\n\nJurgen chuckled.  \"I think I understand.  Good night, Al.\"\n\n\"Come on back soon, Yoorgin,\" Al replied.  \"Play some more with us.\"\n\n\"I'll do that.\"  Jurgen put his hand to his head, then remembered he\nhad no hat.  He smiled and walked out.\n\nJurgen returned to his room long after midnight, turned on the single\nlight, and sat upon the bed to look through his sheaf of music.  He\ntossed the music aside after a few minutes and laid down to think back\nover the evening.  It had been a long time since he had had as much\nfun--sheer enjoyment--as that evening with Plain Al and Mabel.  She was\nremarkable--sophisticated and graceful--they had played together as if\nthey knew each other intimately.\n\nSomething fluttered and fluttered against his eyelids--he opened his\neyes and looked up.  A moth had somehow got into the room, and\nfluttered around and around the lightbulb, casting shadows that\nflitted.  Annoyed to be cast from his reverie, he took his towel and\nbegan flicking at the moth as it circled and circled.  Something about\nthe lightbulb caught his attention then--it was unusually shaped.  He\npulled the chair over beneath it and standing carefully on the chair,\nlooked at the slowly swinging bulb before reaching out to grab the\nsocket.  Stamped upon the end of the bulb in rough, smeared letters\nwere three words:  Made in Hungary.  He almost lost his balance for an\ninstant, and jumped to the floor with a thump.  There was an immediate\nanswering thump from the room below, and Jurgen mentally apologized to\nhis lower neighbor.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nTwo days later, on a Saturday evening, after what had become his\naccustomed daily rounds of playing on street-corners--Jurgen found\nhimself again descending the stairs into Calcutta.  The place was\nnoisier than it had been before.  There might have been thirty people\ninside.  He found a seat at the booth closest to the spotlights--the\nopen tables were full.  A young waitress in a slinky white dress came\nover to serve him.  He decided to have dinner there--a repayment to\nMabel.  The last time, he had only ordered one drink, and when he\nthought back over the evening, decided that he had in fact never paid\nfor it or any of the drinks he had with Al and the others.  At least he\ncould give her some business by ordering dinner.\n\n\"Where's Mabel this evening?\" he asked.\n\n\"Huh?\"  The waitress seemed confused.  She let one knee bend, and ran a\nhand quickly along the strap of her dress.\n\n\"Oh,\" he stammered, \"I thought Mabel would be here.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's here,\" the waitress said, puzzled.  \"She don' work tables\nthough.\"  She leaned on the table with one hand.  \"Can I get you\nsomething to drink first?\"\n\n\"I'll have a Coca-Cola.\"\n\nThe waitress left and came back with his drink.  She set it lightly on\nthe table, with a battered cork coaster beneath, and slid it in front\nof him.  He ordered a few side dishes--words spilling willy-nilly from\nhis mouth while he glanced over the menu.  He was uncertain how much he\nshould order and ended up ordering far too much food to eat alone--but\nhe felt that he really owed Mabel something.  Plain Al showed up later;\nJurgen walked over to say hello, and to thank him for so kindly\nallowing him to play the other evening.  Remembering that he had plates\nof untouched food, he invited Al over to his table.  They ate together\nand talked about the late George Gershwin.\n\n\"Pity how he passed away so suddenly, ain't it?\" Al observed quietly.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be counted among the greatest,\" Jurgen replied.\n\nJurgen joined the band and they spent the rest of the evening working\nover tunes they all knew.  Mabel came out and sang with them, and they\nrounded out the evening with a few long numbers just for the enjoyment\nof listening to each other.  The crowd seemed more appreciative than it\nhad been before--Jurgen believed that anything would have been an\nimprovement.  There were simply more people present, so he felt they\nwere more appreciative, but he guessed it was all part of the same\nthing they heard every Saturday night in Calcutta.  There were a couple\nof other musicians--a hot young sax player with a large belly and a\nlow-hung belt that barely held up a pair of wool pants with worn knees.\nThere was a wrinkled old man, half blind, who played blues with his\nbeat-up guitar--he had a hole the size of a silver dollar in one shoe\nand he wore no socks.  It was far from the symphony, but Jurgen\nthoroughly enjoyed his second evening in Calcutta.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nDropping into the Calcutta to play the evening away quickly became a\npleasant habit over the next few weeks.  Jurgen came to consider his\nprevious life as having been sheltered from some of the finest\nhome-spun music he had ever heard, and he decided there was much to be\nlearned here.  Whether they worked in factories or restaurants, or\ntended stores in the neighborhood, the people who congregated around\nMabel all seemed to have one thing in common:  concentrated musical\ntalent.  They were all masters of jazz melody.  He looked forward to\nhis regular visits--an especially welcome diversion after playing all\nday in the cold, hanging around employment lines looking for symphony\nwork.  The pennies he earned during the day mostly ended up in Mabel's\ncoffers--where Jurgen thought they should be.  His own savings began to\ndwindle.  He increased the hours he spent searching for good employment.\n\nIt seemed to Jurgen that every time he descended the dark stairwell to\nCalcutta and opened the door, there were more customers than had been\nthere the last time.  On the last Saturday night before Christmas--it\nwas Christmas Eve, in fact--Jurgen arrived, thinking he would have\ndinner there.  He threw open the door and found the whole café crowded\nfar beyond capacity.  Every booth was full, and there were two new\ntables plunked down in the corner nearest the spotlights.  Every table\nhad an extra person or two squeezed in.  The place was like a morning\ntrain, but the atmosphere of celebration swirled through the room with\nthe blue haze of cigarette smoke.  Jurgen went slowly forward toward\nthe lights--but could not find a seat anywhere.  The musicians were out\non a break, so the customers all talked among themselves, laughing and\ncheering.  He was about to ask someone at one of the tables if they\nwould mind him crowding in to watch, but Al spotted him from the back\ndoorway.\n\n\"Yoorgin!  Come in back a while,\" he yelled, flailing his arm.\n\nJurgen waved back and pushed his way between the tables.  \"Excuse me.\nI'm very sorry,\" he said as he squeezed through, carrying his viola\ncase over his head with both hands.  He made it to the door, and Al\npulled him into the back.\n\n\"Here, have a glass of bourbon,\" Al said with his silver-toothed grin.\n\"Christmas Eve's time for a little celebratin'!\"\n\nAl brought another rickety wooden chair over to a small table where the\nmusicians were gathered.  Seated on one side was Mabel, dressed in a\nfine long gown that sparkled with red sequins, her hair tied up in a\nbright green turban; long dangling earrings.  She was the picture of\nChristmas, with a tipsy smile.  A chef and two young men in soiled\naprons worked the kitchen stove and oven, clanking pans and mixing\nbowls at the far end of the room; the lights were bright.\n\n\"Jurgen,\" Mabel said as he sat down, \"I was hoping you'd be here this\nevening.  I have something for you.\"  She slid her hand into the bosom\nof her low-cut gown, sending a ripple of laughter among the musicians.\n\"It's a Christmas present,\" she whispered, fishing deeper and\ndeeper--her shoulders wiggled in mirth.  \"If I can find it...\"  She\ndrove her hand deeper to keep them all laughing.\n\nJurgen pulled his chair closer and held his viola case upright between\nhis legs.  Al pushed a tumbler of bourbon in front of him--and Mabel\nslapped five dollars onto the table with both hands.  \"Now you go on\nand take this,\" she insisted.  \"Ever since you showed up here, business\nhas been getting better and better.  I want you to know how much we\nappreciate it.\"\n\nJurgen looked at the bill--it was a crisp, fresh five-dollar note that\nhad been folded, only once, in quarters.  \"Thank you, Mabel,\" Jurgen\nsaid, then paused to fumble with his glass.  He did not touch the bill,\nbut left it sitting on the table in front of him.  \"I'm speechless.\"\nEveryone laughed.\n\n\"Now you just sit here a while with me,\" she continued.  \"The rest of\nyou go on out and play for a while.  I want to talk to Mr. Jurgen in\nprivate.\"  A low murmuring sound swept them, and they backed away.\nWhen Jurgen and Mabel were alone, she raised her glass.  \"Here's to\ngood business,\" she said.\n\n\"To good business,\" Jurgen replied, raising his own glass and clinking\nit delicately against hers.  \"And a Merry Christmas to all...\"\n\n\"Now that,\" Mabel said, \"is what I wanted to talk about.\" She spoke\nquickly, with clarity--as if she had a speech memorized, and was\ndelivering it for an audience.  She punctuated her sentences with wispy\nmotions of her long-nailed fingers.  \"I've been wondering to myself\njust what kind of man you are.  And I've concluded that you're a pretty\npoor man.\"  When Jurgen's smile suddenly dripped away she stopped and\nclosed her eyes theatrically.  \"Oh, that was unfortunately phrased.  I\nmean... you're not a wealthy man.\"\n\nJurgen sat up straight, and Mabel laughed--then set her glass down on\nthe table.  \"It takes no Sherlock Holmes,\" she continued, \"to see that.\nWhy, you've been in here nearly every evening coming on six weeks--and\nin all that time, I don't believe I've seen you in any clothes but the\nrags you have on now.  You must wash 'em, cause you don't smell like my\ngrandpa's barnyard--but I'd guess you don't have any other clothes.\"\n\nJurgen felt himself redden, and looked down, swirling the bourbon in\nhis glass until it ran up along the edge, almost flowing over the rim.\nHe should have packed a much larger wardrobe, and left most of his\nmusic behind.\n\n\"I'm right, aren't I?\"\n\n\"Al once told me you read voraciously.\"\n\nMabel tossed her head and laughed.  \"Not in those words, I expect.  But\nhe's right.  And Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorites.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he answered slowly, \"I must admit I'm rather between full-time\nengagements at this time...and my wardrobe is minimal at the moment...\nI do own a suit, and a top hat...\"\n\n\"So I've been asking myself,\" she interrupted, \"how you live, and where\nyou live.  I've seen you on street-corners a few times, too.  Maybe\nthat's all you do--play your viola--I know well enough it's not just a\n'fiddle'.  So, where are you living now?\"  She hung her wrist limply.\n\"Are you on the street?\"\n\n\"I'm presently lodging at the Charleston.\"\n\n\"Hew!\" she exclaimed, waving her fingers.  \"That place?  Nobody of any\nworth lives at the Charleston.  It's full of winos and whores.\"\n\n\"It's inexpensive,\" Jurgen replied.  \"The decor leaves much to be\ndesired.  But I'm afraid that I'll have to be moving along to even\ncheaper lodgings by the new year.\"\n\n\"That bad?\"\n\nJurgen nodded.  He could probably hold out for another month or two,\nbut by then, he would have to close his new bank account.\n\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"the Charleston is bad enough.  I just won't\nstand for one of my friends hanging his hat in a place like that, or\nworse.  Do you need a place to stay?\"\n\nHe knew she was sincere, but the situation felt uncomfortably close to\ncharity.  His grandmother had always warned against even seeming to be\nin need of charity--let alone actually needing help. \"Really, Mabel, I\ncouldn't presume to burden you with...\"\n\n\"Now, stop it Jurgen,\" she said with a shake of her head.  She scooted\nher hips forward, cupping both hands around her bourbon carefully as if\nshe were settling in for a serious talk.  \"Business here has never been\nbetter--and I think you've had a lot to do with that.  You bring a new\nsound, and people are paying to hear it, and drink a few, and they're\neating food, too...  My friend Dotty, just the other day said to me...\"\nMabel pressed her hand to her breast and forced her voice to a higher\npitch, \"Mabel, honey, I hear deyz a strange waat boy down at\nCalcutta--plays jazz on de fiddle.\"\n\nJurgen laughed at her feigned accent.\n\nMabel let her voice drop to its normal pitch.  \"Are you looking for\nregular work?\"\n\n\"Nothing seems to be available in my line.\"\n\n\"Listen.  First thing, we have to get you out of the Charleston.  Now,\nmy brother's got an extra room--and he's already said he'll put you up,\ncause I've asked him--any friend of his sister is always welcome.  So\nthat leaves work.\"\n\n\"I really could not allow you to do that...\"\n\n\"Well, hear me out, first, before you say that,\" she answered.  \"I'm\nnot half finished.\"\n\nJurgen put up a hand to acquiesce.  \"I'll hear you out.\"\n\n\"My old friend Dotty,\" she began.  \"We went to school together you\nunderstand--when we were children, anyway.  Now, Dotty works for Miss\nEdna.  And Miss Edna thinks the world of her because she's so neat and\norganized.  Miss Edna herself is a flighty thing--she can hardly paint\nher own lips with both hands.\"\n\nJurgen laughed, then bent forward and cupped his glass the way Mabel\ncupped hers, rolling it between his palms.  Mabel had such a way of\nexpressing herself.\n\n\"Now Edna's lover-boy is a man named Lamonte.  I don't know what he\nsees in Edna--to look at her you wouldn't think she can do anything\nright.\"  She winked.  \"Miss Edna's got something softer than brains;\nand it's not in her head.\"\n\nOnly the first part of what she said really caught his attention.\n\"You're speaking of Laurence Lamonte, the conductor?\" He took a quick\nsip of bourbon and rolled the glass again between his palms, wondering\nwhere she was leading; almost seeing it.\n\n\"That's the man,\" Mabel replied with a firm nod of her head.  \"With a\nlittle help from Edna--getting Lamonte in to hear you play--you'll have\nsomething decent in no time.\"  She sipped her bourbon slowly, regarding\nhim.  \"It won't be difficult.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she replied, moving closer with narrowed eyes.  \"I know his\nsecret--Dotty told me.  Our Mr. Lamonte enjoys slipping off discretely\non occasion to hear some... jazz...\"  Putting both palms on the table,\nshe whispered.  \"The way I sometimes slip off to sing... Schubert.\"\n\nJurgen laughed and sat back in his chair.  \"Schubert.\" He did not feel\nparticularly surprised; she probably sang all of Schubert's lieder\nbeautifully.  She sat regarding him with a half-smile, and appeared to\nbe finished with her speech.  He thoughtfully tapped on his glass a few\ntimes, mulling over the proposal, gazing at his fingers.  Finally, he\nlooked up to meet her eyes.  \"You know just what to say.\"\n\nMabel smiled and reached out to pat his hand.  \"Be here tomorrow,\" she\nreplied, \"with your luggage, and I'll take you to meet my brother.\"\nShe raised her glass, and met his in the middle of the table with the\nlightest of taps.\n\nHe sipped.  \"I couldn't have asked for a nicer Christmas.\"\n\n\"I could say the same about you.\"  She sipped once, then slapped her\nglass down and stood up, adjusting her sequined gown around her hips,\nthen leaned over confidently.  \"I'll soon have you joining my secret\nmusical soirées, too.\"  She pointed at the table.  \"Now, don't forget\nyour five dollars.  Let's go make some Christmas music.\"  Jurgen\nslipped the bill into his shirt pocket, then followed her out the door\nand into the spotlights.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nOn Christmas Day at eleven, Jurgen checked out of the Charleston\nResidence Hotel.  Packing took only a few minutes, as he had little in\nthe way of possessions.  When he finished packing, he switched off the\nlight and set his valise and viola case down outside the door.  Leaving\nthe door open, he went back into the room and, holding a hand kerchief\nin his palm, stood on the chair to carefully unscrew the hot bulb from\nits socket.  He closed the door behind him, then crouched in the\nhallway and put the Hungarian lightbulb into his valise, carefully\nwrapped inside his silk shirt.\n\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\n\n                       CHRISTMAS CONCERT\n\n\nIt was several nights before Christmas, and all along the freeway, cars\nwere lined up like a vast herd of red-nosed reindeer being led off to\nslaughter.  I glanced away from the sight and reached out to snap off\nthe radio.  I'd had far too much of the Messiah since Thanksgiving.\nYou'd think a respectable classical station could think of something\nmore original to saturate the airwaves with.  But I knew that even if I\nchanged the station, I'd get White Christmas, or Blue Christmas, or\nDixie Christmas, or some other form of musical blasphemy.  Traffic\nmoved along sluggishly, inching up a long, curving hill.  It was\nraining heavily--one of those sudden tropical storms, only it was\nhappening in a refrigerator.  I had the windshield wipers on full, but\nstill I could hardly see the vehicle in front of me.\n\nAlong with every other irate father, uncle, brother, and son who was\nlate for some engagement or another, I was in the fast lane.  I had\ngotten caught in a last-minute sales meeting, and I was going to be\nlate for my daughter's concert if the idiot in front of me didn't hurry\nup.  The offending car was a Jeep, jacked up on all fours with tires\nbig enough to dwarf a road-grader, and had struts and shock absorbers\nand what-not sticking out all over the undercarriage--a real useful\npiece of machinery for navigating the treacherous Silicon Valley\nfreeways: when you see a car you don't like, you just roll right over\nit.  The Jeep had one of those typical California vanity plates, held\nin place by a brass frame which, had I been able to read it in the\ndark, would have said \"My other truck is a Mack.\"  The driver was\npumping on his brakes continually, no doubt keeping time to some\nCountry Christmas Hit Classic.  Lounging on top of this pinnacle of\nwestern automotive engineering was a Christmas tree, lashed with a\ncouple pieces of thin twine--probably on its way to a living room hung\nwith paintings of nudes on black velvet, and soon to be littered with\ntacky country decorations and strings of popcorn.  The tree listed to\none side, bobbing over the edge of the Jeep's roof in time with the\nblinking brake lights.  The driver's girlfriend was smooching up to him\nin the front seat--I could see her outline through the back window,\npractically sitting in his lap... maybe she _was_ in his lap.  I\nstarted thinking they probably deserved to lose the whole tree.  They'd\nhave a real nice surprise when they got home without it.\n\nI reached over to turn on the radio again, thinking the hourly excerpt\nfrom the Messiah might be over by then.  I should have brought a tape\nfrom home, but I'd barely had time to change my suit.  Just when my\neyes were averted for an instant, the Christmas-tree bedecked vehicle\nin front of me decided to drop its load.  I felt my car go bump, bump,\nand slammed on my brakes before I even looked up.  The car behind me\nskidded and swerved to one side, then leaned on his horn as if he'd run\ninto an iceberg.  I just hit the emergency lights and leaned on my own\nhorn.  The guy in front, perhaps hearing the tooting chorus behind him,\nstopped just down the road, and like an idiot, put his Jeep into\nreverse and came hurtling back toward me.  He skidded to a stop and put\non his emergency lights.\n\nWhat kind of jerk ties down a Christmas tree so loosely that it flops\noff in the middle of a freeway?  We were only doing twenty miles an\nhour--in the rain, no less.  I thought I would have to get out and\ncheck the extent of the damage, and I wasn't happy about slogging in\nthe rain with my dress shoes on.  Hallelujah, the jerk stopped, anyway,\nso I could at least get the name of his insurance company--I'd already\nmemorized his personal license number (which doesn't bear\nrepeating--I'd always thought the DMV had standards of decency).\n\nI hopped out, trying to pull up the collar of my overcoat even though\nit wouldn't quite cover my head, and started walking forward to have a\nfew choice words with Mister Country Jamboree in the over-endowed\nautomobile.  Of course, CJ (as I then dubbed the driver) bounded out of\nthe Jeep and headed my way, tucking in his shirt as he walked.  One\nlook at him, and I almost turned around and left--CJ could have been\nPaul Bunyan's twin brother.  He had the shirt to prove it, too:  red\nand black lumberjack style checks, with the top three buttons undone,\nand chest hair that was thicker than my beard.  He also wore cowboy\nboots and wide red suspenders.\n\n\"Holy moley, mister!\" he yelled with a tone of real concern.  \"You\nalright?\"\n\nI was about to lay into him when his gum-chewing girlfriend appeared\nfrom behind, tucking herself into his armpit.  \"Oh!\" she squealed,\n\"Ah'm so sorry!  Looks like our tree smashed up your brand new car!\"\n\nMy car wasn't exactly brand new, but I looked around to where she\npointed.  Sure enough, the front grill was bent in and one headlight\nhad gone out, the glass completely smashed.  The tree itself was\nnestled cozily under the car, nuzzling up against the oil pan.\n\nThe look of childish helplessness on both their faces--and frankly what\nI considered might be a moderate dose of dull wittedness--somehow got\nto me just then, and I couldn't quite bring myself to swear at them.\nBesides, the fastest thing to do would be to shrug it off with a happy\nface, extract their battered shrubbery from beneath my car, and be on\nmy way.  I decided that silliness would carry the day.  \"Merry\nChristmas!\" I called, throwing out my arms.  \"Sorry about your tree!\"\nBoth of them lit up in grins.\n\n\"Look--he ain't even mad,\" the guy said to his girlfriend.\n\nShe batted her lashes in astonishment.  \"We're awfully sorry about\nthis,\" she chimed, wagging her head.\n\nIt only took a minute to get the tree out from under the car.  All the\nwhile, I was thinking of how to explain it to the patrolman who would\nundoubtedly appear in a moment:  it's just another roadkill, officer,\nnothing to be alarmed about; I'm sure it happens all the time, what\nwith all these trees swooping down on unsuspecting holiday merrymakers.\n\nThe tree was pretty battered up around the lower branches, but it\nreally could have sufficed to cheer someone's holiday--if one cut off a\ncouple feet from the bottom and turned the bad side toward the wall so\nit couldn't be seen.  You only decorate half the tree anyway, right?  I\nstarted trying to explain this to my countrified acquaintances, but\nthey would have none of it.\n\n\"Look, mister,\" CJ drawled, propping up the tree with one hand.  \"We\nbusted out yer headlight.  Hell, the least I can do is give ya the\ntree.\"\n\nThe woman tilted her head and shot out a hand to touch my arm.  She had\na horrified look in her wide eyes that I could see even through her\ndripping mascara.  \"You ain't already got one do ya, mister?\"\n\nI glanced at my watch and tried to weasel out of it.  I'd already nixed\nthe idea of a Christmas tree--told my family (meaning my daughter,\nJenny) we weren't having one that year, and that was final.  They just\nshed all over the carpets and had to be tossed out at precisely the\nright moment in January or the city garbage folks wouldn't pick them\nup.  We'd had a tree one year that sat around well into February\nbecause we missed the magic pick-up date.  I finally chopped it into\nlittle bits and threw it out a piece at a time over the next six weeks.\nI had no use whatever for a Christmas tree.\n\nIn the end, I didn't want to argue with them--it was cold, exceedingly\nwet, and I was already going to be late for the concert.  So CJ helped\nme load the mortally wounded conifer into my trunk.  We groped around\nfor the twine, but couldn't find it, so he battened down the lid with\nhis girlfriend's belt.  She had high-tailed it back into the Jeep to\nwait for him out of the rain.  He whispered into my ear while he\ncinched up the belt.  \"She don't really need her belt,\" he said.  \"I'd\nhave it off her in another couple o' miles anyways.\"  He gave me a wink\nand wished me a Merry Christmas.\n\nBy the time I arrived at the hall, the concert had long since begun and\nit was almost intermission.  I detest arriving late for these things,\nand I had to wait around the lobby until the first part was over.  I\nwas thankful I'd not been any later.  Jenny would have been sorely\ndisappointed if I'd missed her big debut:  about twenty minutes from\nthe time I arrived in the lobby, she was scheduled to begin her first\npublic performance as a featured soloist--playing \"Harold in Italy\".\nIf you don't know it, it's a fine piece of music, but it's not in the\nfrequently-performed repertoire, because it's sort of a half-fledged\nconcerto for viola.  Not the violin or the cello--the viola:  underdog\nof all orchestral instruments.\n\nMy daughter Jenny wasn't always a violist.  We started her out right on\nthe violin--something I considered a respectable instrument for a young\nlady.  My ex-wife and I had faint hopes that someday she'd be a concert\nviolinist--Jenny was that good from the time she picked up her first\nquarter-sized fiddle.  We spent a fortune on expensive teachers, and as\nsoon as she was ready, we started her on the long track:  youth\nsymphony.  But just after her fourteenth birthday, something happened\nto her brain.  I don't mean a pre-mature stroke or some kind of lesion.\nShe came home one day with this hideous dreamy look in her eyes, and\nshe puttered around the kitchen nervously helping me cook.  She wasn't\ntalking very much.\n\nI didn't want to probe, figuring she'd tell me what was on her mind\nwhen she was ready.  \"I have to go to Milan next month,\" I said, trying\nto be cheerful.\n\nShe was tearing lettuce leaves into microscopic fragments, and she\nlooked up.  \"Will you see Grandma?\"\n\nJenny meant my mother--fountainhead of all family quirks.  As a\nbright-eyed Italian girl of seventeen she married her American\nsweetheart and came to the States.  It turned out to be a terrible\nmarriage, and years later, after dutifully raising four kids, she\ndivorced my father, American style, and went home to the Old Country.\nJenny had only met her a few times, but when they did meet you couldn't\npry them apart.\n\n\"Uh-huh.  I thought I might take you along, if you can stand it,\"  I\nteased.  I pulled the salad bowl away from her and tossed in the tomato\nI had been cutting.  \"We'll leave the day before spring-break.\"\n\nShe brightened a bit at that, and with a very limp wrist, laid a whole\nleaf of lettuce on top of the chopped tomato.  \"Can we stop in Vienna?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Jenny...  Maybe for a day or two.\"\n\nShe put on a weak smile.  \"Can we go to the opera?\" she asked softly.\nJenny's enthusiasm for opera was phenomenal.  She must have inherited\nthat from my mother, too--I always thought half the reason she went\nback to Milan was because they did too many German operas in San\nFrancisco.\n\n\"Only if you can drag Grandma along.\"  I picked up the salad and two\nbowls, then waltzed away toward the dining room.\n\nOver dinner she made her momentous announcement.  I had just put a big\nbite of steak into my mouth and was chewing thoughtfully.  I even\nrecall we were listening to something by Prokofiev.\n\n\"Daddy, I'm going to switch,\" she said quickly with an air of\nnon-chalance.\n\nI paused, finished chewing, and then fell right into the pit.  \"That's\nfine, honey...\"  Another pause.  She wasn't looking right at me, and I\nleaned over to try to catch her eye.  \"You're going to switch what?\"\n\nShe stabbed at her steak, fork delicately held in her left hand just\nlike we'd taught her all her life.  \"To viola.\"  She slid a small piece\nof steak into her mouth and started chewing.\n\nI gagged, and put down my fork, but she kept on chattering with her\nmouth full, trying to convince me before I could even voice the\nbeginning of an objection.  Finally she appealed to my conceit.  \"You\nwant me to be a great musician, right Daddy?\"\n\nI tried to agree that had been our hope, but I was still trying to\ncatch my breath.\n\n\"Well, I'm sitting third-desk right now.  Do you know what that\n_means_?\" she whined.  \"I'll never get anywhere in a concert career.\nYou have to sit first-desk--or be the concert mistress.\"\n\nI coughed a couple more times.  \"But you're doing fine,\" I insisted.\n\"You're the best.\"\n\nShe gave me her old half-frown, pulling down one side of her mouth and\nscrewing up her eyes, then rolling them away toward the ceiling.\n\"Daddy,\" she said, \"I'm not the best.  Mary is the best.\"  She pushed\nanother piece of steak onto her fork.  \"I'm sitting third desk with\nDeadpan Wang.\"  She got that dreamy look again, and balanced her fork\non two fingers.  \"But if I switch to viola--they're always in greater\ndemand you know, because fewer people play viola, Daddy--I could be\nsitting first desk.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I told her, \"you've already won a couple of competitions, are\nyou going to throw all that effort away, and take up... the _viola_?\"\nI actually gulped.\n\n\"_You_ might call it winning,\" she shot back, \"but I've never taken\nbetter than second place.\"\n\n\"What about the cello?\"\n\n\"Daddy,\" she whined again, putting down her knife and picking up her\nmilk.  \"The technique is too different--you should have started me on\ncello ten years ago.\"\n\n\"Does your mother know about this?\"\n\nShe twirled her fork among her green beans and wouldn't meet my eyes.\n\"No.\"  She looked up with knotted eyebrows.  \"She doesn't care.\"\n\n\"Jenny, she does too...\"  I let that trail off lamely and we ate in\nsilence for a while.\n\nNow, I had nothing particular against the viola, as an instrument.\nFrankly speaking, I've known a couple of violists pretty\nintimately--and I've always found violists to be warm and tender\npeople.  Much less high-strung, so to speak, than violinists.  Not\nquite as passionate as cellists.  But I would hardly have considered\nthe viola to be a prestigious solo instrument.  How many famous\nviolists can you name?  How many great viola concertos?  \"The\nrepertoire is too limited,\" I said, speaking what was on my mind.  This\nfact did not deter her determination.\n\n\"Mr. Rossi thinks I'd make a great violist,\" she replied.  There was\nthat look again, right in her light brown eyes.  Just like her mother.\n\nI had a sudden insight:  my teenage daughter had a crush on the\nconductor.  He needed a violist, and apparently he was astute enough to\ntake advantage of a young girl's infatuation to get one.  Maybe I'd\nhave a word about cradle robbing with Mr. Rossi.  Well, no that was a\nbit much, I decided.  Jenny would have given me the silent treatment\nfor a week.  I'd have to stay calm.  I told her to think about it for a\nwhile, and after a couple weeks, if she still wanted to descend to\nbeing a violist, we'd see.\n\nHalf an hour later, while I did the dishes, she was on the phone to\nsomeone, and jabbered away for a couple of hours to her friends while\nshe dragged the phone all over the living room.  I decided again I'd\nhave to join the modern age and get a cordless phone.  She probably was\nabout ready for her own private line.  I thought maybe I ought to make\nher pay for it, too.\n\nJenny worked her way up to first desk within a year of taking up her\nbeloved viola, and despite myself I was beginning to be slightly proud\nof her.  She really was in higher demand, and was constantly so\ninvolved with chamber ensembles, youth symphony, flitting here and\nthere, that a lot of her schoolwork was suffering noticeably.  Her\ngrade-point average dropped until she was barely maintaining a \"B\".  We\nhad a little talk about that, and decided mutually (or at least I like\nto think it was mutual) that she needed to pull it up, or I'd pull the\nplug on all her extra-curricular activities.\n\nSo there I was, three years later, pacing the lobby, waiting.  I heard\napplause in the auditorium, so I snuck in the door.  The hall was\npacked solid.  At least it seemed packed solid for a moment.  I found a\npretty lousy seat near the back and plopped myself down while I looked\naround for something closer.  I spotted an aisle seat near the middle,\nso I moved down and slid into it.  I need not have rushed--it was\nintermission, so I sat there for ten minutes contemplating.  Soon, the\norchestra filed back in and the audience bustled around to reclaim\ntheir seats.  The conductor, the notorious Mr. Rossi, re-appeared on\nstage, and the orchestra stood for him.  I waited through the next\ntorturous work on the menu, hoping it would be over quickly.  When it\nended, I clapped a couple of times and hoped the rest of the audience\ndidn't go wild.\n\nWhen the applause died out, I found I was holding my breath.  Then,\nJenny appeared in the wings, and strolled forward, her instrument\ndangling easily from one hand.  I could see her scan the crowd and\nsmile--she was really just looking for me.  I felt like waving, but\nthat would have been gauche, so I kept my hands to myself.  There she\nwas, her black skirt billowing from a waist and hips that resembled her\nmother's gorgeous figure more each time I noticed it.  Her starched\nwhite blouse almost crackled.  She had spent half an hour fussing over\nit with the iron, then spent another half an hour getting every speck\nof lint off her silk skirt.  I noticed that her shoe-laces were untied,\nas usual, and broke out in a smile.  At that instant, she tripped over\nthe foot of a music stand--an intense foreboding chill shot through my\nspine and flashed along every nerve in my body when I saw her sailing\nheadlong toward the floor.  A gasp went up from the crowd, and the\napplause stopped immediately.\n\nHer reflexes, I must admit, were those of a well-bred cat, and her\ninstinct for self-preservation must never have been stronger:  her\nviola never hit the floor.  The conductor, wheeling around when he\nheard the clattering sound, stepped from his podium to assist her in\nstanding again.  One of the violinists, whose improperly placed music\nstand had done the damage, put down his violin to pick up the debris.\nThe conductor had a few words with Jenny, and then he escorted her off\nthe stage.  She limped, and would put no weight on one leg.  Rossi's\narm seemed to be practically fondling her chest and I felt a surge of\nfatherly irritation.  I was already on my feet when they started off,\nand was trotting down the aisle toward the front of the auditorium.\n\n\"I'm her father,\" I shouted at the old ladies who tried to stop me from\nascending the side stairs.  By then, some numbskull appeared from the\nwings to make an announcement that there would be a slight delay, and\nask the audience to please wait a few moments.  \"Tell 'em a few jokes,\"\nI suggested as I dashed past.  I didn't wait to hear what he said next,\nbut ran into the back, looking for the green room.  I was certain\nthat's where she would have gone.  I hoped they had a doctor handy.\n\nIn another minute or two, I was with Jenny and the infamous Mr. Rossi,\nwho had his arm around her waist and was consoling her in oily\nwhispers.  She sat with her priceless viola set across her lap--well,\nit was priceless enough to me, as I couldn't afford to buy another one\nlike it even if I sold both of my cars.  Her bow had been snapped in\ntwo and was draped across the viola, two pieces of splintered wood\ndangling from white horsehair.  She wept into the palm of one hand.\n\n\"Darling, are you OK?\" I asked, rushing up to her.  Mr. Rossi wisely\nremoved his roaming hand and stood back a few steps.\n\n\"I think I just sprained my ankle,\" she replied, but that was not the\nuppermost thing on her mind.  \"Oh, Daddy--look at my bow!\"\n\n\"Hey, we can get a new one,\" I told her, lifting it up.  \"I saw the way\nyou saved your viola,\" I said, trying to sound cheerful.  \"It was a\ngreat maneuver!\"\n\nShe didn't smile.  \"But... how am I going to _play_?\"\n\nI turned to Mr. Rossi.  \"Look, I'll take her to see a doctor, and...\"\n\n\"NO!\" Jenny screamed.  \"I have to go on!  There are people waiting out\nthere!\"\n\n\"Honey,\" I replied, \"you have to see a doctor right away.\"\n\n\"Daddy--people paid _money_ to see me play tonight...\" She started\ncrying again.  \"If I don't go on I'll be humiliated forever!\"\n\nUnder his breath, Rossi was making ecstatic noises in a thick, and\nquite ineffable, European accent.  He sounded like a bad Italian wine\nwith a French label--bottled in Austria and shipped via the\nTrans-Siberian Railway to Alaska where it was smuggled south on a\nCanadian ship.  \"She eez a true artiste...\"\n\nTry as I might, I could not convince her to come away with me.  She was\nstubborn in that way--more stubborn than her mother had ever been.  Mr.\nRossi was no help at all in the matter either: he seemed to agree with\nher!\n\n\"But you can't stand up,\" I added, still trying to convince her.\n\n\"I'll sit,\" she replied curtly.  Her tears had all dried up by then.\n\n\"Oh yais, eets no problaim,\" Mr. Rossi interjected, \"we'll seemply yoos\nainuther baow.\"  I shot him a look that shut him up immediately.\n\nJenny insisted on performing.  She always carried another bow, and now\nthe wisdom of that practice was proven.  Unfortunately, it would have\nto suffice, though she had repeatedly decried it as being \"quite an\ninferior stick\" for playing anything serious.  She got her elitism from\nher mother, too.\n\nMr. Rossi clapped his hands, entirely relieved.  \"Ah, but ZEES awdiense\nweel nevair hear souch subtle deefferense!\"  I knew what he meant\ntoo--the auditorium was filled with hundreds of glassy eyed parents,\nsiblings, and tiny tots; half of them probably could not even spell\n\"viola\".  Mr. Rossi practically pranced away--off to see the numbskull\nand make another announcement: the soloist was unharmed; the show would\ngo on.\n\nJenny had only one further thought:  she'd had enough time to stop\nshaking, but she was so unnerved by the experience that she decided she\ncould never trust herself to play from memory.  \"I really must have the\nscore, Daddy.  I should.\"\n\nThe ladies of the green room were bustling around, trying to fawn over\nher, but keeping a respectful distance from her father, whom they\ncorrectly perceived to be an ape in a touchy mood.  Oh, yes, they all\nagreed whole-heartedly that it would be no disgrace at all.  Plenty of\nsoloists had played before with the music in front of them.  And\nconsidering the state of her nerves, the audience would be so\nrelieved--and honored--to have her play at all, that they would forgive\nthe minor irregularity of playing from the music.  By all means, she\nmust have the score.\n\nReluctantly, I finally gave in and knelt down to tie her shoe-laces.\nShe could not stand unassisted--we tried a few experimental steps and\nshe collapsed immediately under her own weight.  One of the ladies\nproduced an ace bandage, so we tied up her ankle, which had swollen so\nmuch it looked like a baked yam.  A chair was taken onto the stage for\nher to sit.  And of course, since she would be playing from the score,\nshe needed a page turner.\n\nIt was the hand of fate: I knew the music, and I was wearing a black\nsuit.  \"Honey--I'll turn the pages,\" I offered boldly before anyone\nelse could volunteer.  \"Just like we used to do.\"\n\nShe gave me that little-girl smile--I'd hardly seen it in ten years,\nbut it made me feel like a real father again.  \"Oh, Daddy, would you?\"\n\n\"Come on,\" I said, putting my arm around her.  \"I'll escort my princess\nto her throne.\"  She laughed, and we left the green room with her\nlimping along beside me.\n\nNow, I'm not much of a theatre person.  I never attend plays, and the\nlast time I was on stage I was in the third grade.  By the time we\nreached the wings, I knew my face had already turned the color of a\nripe tomato and I was sweating.  I should have let one of the bustling\nladies turn pages for her.  How I could face an audience, I had no\nidea.  I concentrated on keeping my daughter's weight off her sprained\nankle.\n\nAs we sat down, I had a brief moment to look out and feel terrified.\nThe auditorium was dark, so I could only see the first few rows.  And I\ncould sense the breathing masses beyond the lights, hovering\nexpectantly in the shadows, ready to slash me to ribbons.  A hot wind\nwas blowing in over the bobbing heads in the front; their forked\ntongues wagged angrily as they coiled slowly.  I could almost see the\nsand whipping across the dunes.  They were pretty damp dunes, though,\nsince it was a rainy night.  I could feel the intense humidity in the\nbreeze.  The conductor gave a nod, with a broad smile in our direction,\nand the orchestra struck up with the soft introduction.\n\nI panicked at first, shooting my eyes across the page of music, trying\nto remember what I was supposed to be doing.  Where was the first page\nturn?  I couldn't even remember how to read the little black dots.  The\npage took on the look of an obscure foreign document splayed out across\nthe music stand, filled with incomprehensible ink blots.  It was a\nRorschach test for the incurably insane.  The whole scene was backed by\nthe restless, peering faces of the audience.  I closed my eyes briefly,\ntrying to calm myself.  I snapped them open immediately, however.  If I\nhad my eyes closed, I would miss Jenny's signal.  If that happened, I\nknew all would be lost for certain.  I'd be laughed off the stage, and\nshe would be ruined before she had even begun.\n\nOnly an eccentric maniac like Rossi the Terrible would have picked\n\"Harold in Italy\" for the finale of a Christmas concert.  It's not\nseasonal in the least--what was wrong with something seasonal that\ndidn't require a viola solo?  But I guess, the orchestra was ready,\nJenny was ready--maybe under his mop of stringy and vaguely European\nhair he thought it would be an exquisitely quirky touch to perform it\nfor Christmas instead of waiting until spring.\n\nThe first few page turns passed without incident, and my heart-rate\nsteadily decreased toward normal.  She nodded knowingly at just the\nright instants, and I managed to turn the pages without spilling\neverything all over the floor or uttering a primal scream.  After that,\neach page turn became easier, and I found that by the time we were well\ninto the piece, I was breathing again, and I could follow the score.  I\nbegan to get cocky too, and took a few glances at the audience out of\nthe corner of my eye.  I could feel the rapture, starting up out there\nsomewhere like a wisp of cool air.  She was playing beautifully,\npassionately.  Mr. Rossi was conducting as brilliantly as he could--at\nleast his expansive gesticulations looked fervent.  I had heard the\npiece so many times--the solo passages anyway--that I knew it by heart.\nBut hearing it then, pouring from Jenny's viola backed by the\nshimmering of Berlioz' orchestration, it took on a sublime quality that\nI had completely forgotten.  It had been a long time since I had really\nlistened to \"Harold in Italy\", and all the old memories started to come\nback.\n\nThe second movement has a quality like a caravan painted in broad,\ncolorful strokes.  It starts out very softly, and builds up as the\ncaravan approaches, passes by the listener, and then eventually recedes\ninto the distance.  It's a striking section, and personally I think\nit's the best part of the whole work.  By that time, I was alert again,\nand was trying to gauge the audience reaction.  I had started to\nrecognize individual faces, and remember where they were--I had been\nturning pages for more than fifteen minutes.  I kept track of where\npeople were looking, whether they folded their hands, how they tilted\ntheir heads at certain points.  I didn't hear a lot of coughing and\nshuffling either.  As my eyes grew accustomed to looking at them, I\ncould see further, beyond the first few rows.  They really were--I\nsuppose a Victorian might have said \"transported\"--by the music.  I\nflipped the page again at Jenny's nod.\n\nI had noticed previously one rather large woman near the front row.\nShe was all dressed up with several long strings of pearls and a long\ndress of medium golden-brown shades with lacy white frills and a high\ncollar.  She had pale, white skin, and her brunette hair was tied up in\na hideous bun and topped with a white flower.  The whole outfit made\nher look like an overdressed turkey dinner with all the trimmings and\nthose little white caps on the drumsticks.  She seemed for a long while\nto be even more \"transported\" than anyone else.  I could see the rouge\non her cheeks; her lips were parted and she bent forward.  The next\ntime I chanced to look her way, near the end of the second movement,\nshe was crying into her handkerchief.\n\nAt that moment, as the caravan was fading into the distance, I had a\nkind of revelation that I'll never forget.  This is what it's all\nabout, really, I told myself.  This is Jenny's life, and the kind of\nemotions she can evoke in an audience are her special gift.  Maybe I\nhad never really come to terms with the direction she had chosen.  I\nstarted to feel tingly and blurry eyed.  If she, with her playing,\ncould bring tears to even one large woman in a worse-than-average\naudience, she must also be bringing joy to another, and at least some\nfeeling to someone else; maybe everyone else.  If she really wanted to\ndo that with a viola instead of a violin--bringing a new kind of life\nto a little regarded solo instrument--I felt I could finally accept it.\nSomehow, over the past three years, my opposition to her taking up the\nviola had completely blinded me to the fact that she was actually\nsucceeding.  It felt like her destiny beginning to unfold.  I was\nsitting on stage with my seventeen year-old daughter, actually\nparticipating in her debut as a soloist.  How many fathers have that\nopportunity, I wondered.  I felt a growing sense of privilege attending\nthe event, and I was elated by the time the third movement was over.\nJenny would fly away from me, of course, into some concert career,\nclimbing ever higher--the inevitable result of a child growing into an\nindependent woman with a great art to unleash on the world.  Whether\nshe ever became a famous soloist or not, I thought at that moment, was\nirrelevant.  It was really the ambience that she lived for; not only\nthe brief moments of performing, but also the people around her--the\nfriends with whom she played and passed her time, the practicing, the\ndedication; even Mr. Rossi, whether I really liked him or not.  I could\nhardly keep tears out of my eyes long enough to turn pages through the\nend of the fourth movement.\n\nWhen the music finished and the last blast faded into the walls, there\nwas fully ten seconds of absolute silence in the auditorium.  What\nhappened to all the tiny tots?  I almost wondered if the audience had\ngone to sleep!  The applause began from the front--the large woman held\nher handkerchief between two fat fingers, and was applauding wildly,\necstatically, leading the crowd.  I had never seen such fervor in a\nspectator.  She was shaking her head, back and forth--I could see the\ntears glistening on her cheeks--she threw kisses.  In an instant, the\napplause grew to a tremendous roar that crashed against the front of\nthe stage... and then the audience, en masse, were on their feet.  I\ncould almost not believe it--a standing ovation for \"Harold in Italy\"?\nNo, it was all for Jenny.\n\nThe reception afterwards was gorgeous.  I stood back, still hovering\nclose to Jenny while she took the greetings of her friends and random\nmembers of the audience, including the large woman with the\nhandkerchief.  I sipped a California white wine that was far too young\nand sassy, and let her bask for nearly an hour.  She still could not\nstand up, of course, so they had brought her a padded chair from\nsomewhere, and she sat straight-backed like a little monarch, with a\nbig bouquet of pink roses nestled in the crook of one arm, nodding and\nsmiling.  The other hand was perpetually extended to receive other\nhands--and on a few occasions to receive a kiss from some lecherous\nold geezer.\n\nIt ended all too soon for Jenny, I could see.  But when I glanced at\nher face as the last of the stragglers were leaving the room, I could\ntell she was dead tired.  The pain in her ankle could not be masked any\nlonger either.  She winced and stretched out her legs when I approached.\n\n\"Daddy, let's stop by the hospital on the way home, OK?  Just to make\nsure it's not broken or anything.\"\n\nI laughed.  \"Sure thing, Jenny.\"  She had always been small, like her\nmother, and had never grown too big to carry.  I lifted her up, and\nholding her viola case in one hand, carried her out to the parking lot.\nThe rain had stopped, and half the clouds had dispersed.  The moon lit\nup the remaining clouds like big silver scoops over the far hills--and\na few stars twinkled overhead in the cold air.\n\nI whirled around, and around as I walked.  \"Let's see,\" I kept saying,\n\"was it this way?\" And I would whirl her one way.  \"Or was it that\nway?\"  She was in giggles, with her arms clasped behind my neck.\n\nWe found the car--I knew where it was all along, but I was having fun.\nWhen we reached the car, I set her down on her feet for a moment to\nfish my keys out of my pocket.  Meanwhile, I handed her the viola case,\nand she took it absently.  She turned around then, and seeing the front\nof the car for the first time, burst out in a squeal.  \"What the hell\nhappened to your car?\" She limped to follow me to the door.\n\n\"Little mishap on the freeway,\" I replied, unlocking the passenger\ndoor.  Her eyes went from the front grill back along the side of the\ncar.  I couldn't help smiling when her eyes stopped at the trunk.  It\nwas half open, with big sprigs of fir tree bulging out all over.\n\n\"Oh, Daddy...\" she whispered, clutching my shoulder.  I heard that warm\ntone come back into her voice and she embraced me.  \"You said we\nweren't going to have a tree this year...\"\n\n\"Changed my mind, honey,\" I replied.  \"Besides--it was too cheap to\npass up.\"  I grabbed her viola case out of her hand.  \"Got it from mah\nol' frenn CJ,\" I drawled.\n\nShe looked at me like I was made of goat cheese. \"What?\"\n\n\"Get in, I'll tell you about it on the way,\" I answered, holding the\ndoor for her.  \"Poor thing had an accident on the freeway, but it ain't\nnothin' a little amputation won't fix.\""
