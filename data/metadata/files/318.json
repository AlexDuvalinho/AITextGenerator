 "text": "JOHN BARLEYCORN\n\n\nby\n\nJack London (1876-1916)\n\n\n\n1913\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nIt all came to me one election day.  It was on a warm California\nafternoon, and I had ridden down into the Valley of the Moon from the\nranch to the little village to vote Yes and No to a host of proposed\namendments to the Constitution of the State of California.  Because of\nthe warmth of the day I had had several drinks before casting my ballot,\nand divers drinks after casting it.  Then I had ridden up through the\nvine-clad hills and rolling pastures of the ranch, and arrived at the\nfarm-house in time for another drink and supper.\n\n\"How did you vote on the suffrage amendment?\" Charmian asked.\n\n\"I voted for it.\"\n\nShe uttered an exclamation of surprise.  For, be it known, in my younger\ndays, despite my ardent democracy, I had been opposed to woman suffrage.\nIn my later and more tolerant years I had been unenthusiastic in my\nacceptance of it as an inevitable social phenomenon.\n\n\"Now just why did you vote for it?\" Charmian asked.\n\nI answered.  I answered at length.  I answered indignantly.  The more I\nanswered, the more indignant I became.  (No; I was not drunk.  The horse\nI had ridden was well named \"The Outlaw.\"  I'd like to see any drunken\nman ride her.)\n\nAnd yet--how shall I say?--I was lighted up, I was feeling \"good,\" I was\npleasantly jingled.\n\n\"When the women get the ballot, they will vote for prohibition,\" I said.\n\"It is the wives, and sisters, and mothers, and they only, who will drive\nthe nails into the coffin of John Barleycorn----\"\n\n\"But I thought you were a friend to John Barleycorn,\" Charmian\ninterpolated.\n\n\"I am.  I was.  I am not.  I never am.  I am never less his friend than\nwhen he is with me and when I seem most his friend.  He is the king of\nliars.  He is the frankest truthsayer.  He is the august companion with\nwhom one walks with the gods.  He is also in league with the Noseless\nOne.  His way leads to truth naked, and to death.  He gives clear vision,\nand muddy dreams.  He is the enemy of life, and the teacher of wisdom\nbeyond life's wisdom.  He is a red-handed killer, and he slays youth.\"\n\nAnd Charmian looked at me, and I knew she wondered where I had got it.\n\nI continued to talk.  As I say, I was lighted up.  In my brain every\nthought was at home.  Every thought, in its little cell, crouched\nready-dressed at the door, like prisoners at midnight waiting a jail-break.  And\nevery thought was a vision, bright-imaged, sharp-cut, unmistakable.  My\nbrain was illuminated by the clear, white light of alcohol.  John\nBarleycorn was on a truth-telling rampage, giving away the choicest\nsecrets on himself.  And I was his spokesman.  There moved the multitudes\nof memories of my past life, all orderly arranged like soldiers in some\nvast review.  It was mine to pick and choose.  I was a lord of thought,\nthe master of my vocabulary and of the totality of my experience,\nunerringly capable of selecting my data and building my exposition.  For\nso John Barleycorn tricks and lures, setting the maggots of intelligence\ngnawing, whispering his fatal intuitions of truth, flinging purple\npassages into the monotony of one's days.\n\nI outlined my life to Charmian, and expounded the make-up of my\nconstitution.  I was no hereditary alcoholic.  I had been born with no\norganic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.  In this matter I was\nnormal in my generation.  Alcohol was an acquired taste.  It had been\npainfully acquired.  Alcohol had been a dreadfully repugnant thing--more\nnauseous than any physic.  Even now I did not like the taste of it.  I\ndrank it only for its \"kick.\" And from the age of five to that of\ntwenty-five I had not learned to care for its kick.  Twenty years of\nunwilling apprenticeship had been required to make my system rebelliously\ntolerant of alcohol, to make me, in the heart and the deeps of me,\ndesirous of alcohol.\n\nI sketched my first contacts with alcohol, told of my first intoxications\nand revulsions, and pointed out always the one thing that in the end had\nwon me over--namely, the accessibility of alcohol.  Not only had it\nalways been accessible, but every interest of my developing life had\ndrawn me to it.  A newsboy on the streets, a sailor, a miner, a wanderer\nin far lands, always where men came together to exchange ideas, to laugh\nand boast and dare, to relax, to forget the dull toil of tiresome nights\nand days, always they came together over alcohol.  The saloon was the\nplace of congregation.  Men gathered to it as primitive men gathered\nabout the fire of the squatting place or the fire at the mouth of the\ncave.\n\nI reminded Charmian of the canoe houses from which she had been barred in\nthe South Pacific, where the kinky-haired cannibals escaped from their\nwomenkind and feasted and drank by themselves, the sacred precincts taboo\nto women under pain of death.  As a youth, by way of the saloon I had\nescaped from the narrowness of woman's influence into the wide free world\nof men.  All ways led to the saloon.  The thousand roads of romance and\nadventure drew together in the saloon, and thence led out and on over the\nworld.\n\n\"The point is,\" I concluded my sermon, \"that it is the accessibility of\nalcohol that has given me my taste for alcohol.  I did not care for it.\nI used to laugh at it.  Yet here I am, at the last, possessed with the\ndrinker's desire.  It took twenty years to implant that desire; and for\nten years more that desire has grown.  And the effect of satisfying that\ndesire is anything but good.  Temperamentally I am wholesome-hearted and\nmerry.  Yet when I walk with John Barleycorn I suffer all the damnation\nof intellectual pessimism.\n\n\"But,\" I hastened to add (I always hasten to add), \"John Barleycorn must\nhave his due.  He does tell the truth.  That is the curse of it.  The\nso-called truths of life are not true.  They are the vital lies by which\nlife lives, and John Barleycorn gives them the lie.\"\n\n\"Which does not make toward life,\" Charmian said.\n\n\"Very true,\" I answered.  \"And that is the perfectest hell of it.  John\nBarleycorn makes toward death.  That is why I voted for the amendment\nto-day.  I read back in my life and saw how the accessibility of alcohol\nhad given me the taste for it.  You see, comparatively few alcoholics are\nborn in a generation.  And by alcoholic I mean a man whose chemistry\ncraves alcohol and drives him resistlessly to it.  The great majority of\nhabitual drinkers are born not only without desire for alcohol, but with\nactual repugnance toward it.  Not the first, nor the twentieth, nor the\nhundredth drink, succeeded in giving them the liking.  But they learned,\njust as men learn to smoke; though it is far easier to learn to smoke\nthan to learn to drink.  They learned because alcohol was so accessible.\nThe women know the game.  They pay for it--the wives and sisters and\nmothers.  And when they come to vote, they will vote for prohibition.\nAnd the best of it is that there will be no hardship worked on the coming\ngeneration.  Not having access to alcohol, not being predisposed toward\nalcohol, it will never miss alcohol.  It will mean life more abundant for\nthe manhood of the young boys born and growing up--ay, and life more\nabundant for the young girls born and growing up to share the lives of\nthe young men.\"\n\n\"Why not write all this up for the sake of the men and women coming?\"\nCharmian asked.  \"Why not write it so as to help the wives and sisters\nand mothers to the way they should vote?\"\n\n\"The 'Memoirs of an Alcoholic,'\" I sneered--or, rather, John Barleycorn\nsneered; for he sat with me there at table in my pleasant, philanthropic\njingle, and it is a trick of John Barleycorn to turn the smile to a sneer\nwithout an instant's warning.\n\n\"No,\" said Charmian, ignoring John Barleycorn's roughness, as so many\nwomen have learned to do.  \"You have shown yourself no alcoholic, no\ndipsomaniac, but merely an habitual drinker, one who has made John\nBarleycorn's acquaintance through long years of rubbing shoulders with\nhim.  Write it up and call it 'Alcoholic Memoirs.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAnd, ere I begin, I must ask the reader to walk with me in all sympathy;\nand, since sympathy is merely understanding, begin by understanding me\nand whom and what I write about.  In the first place, I am a seasoned\ndrinker.  I have no constitutional predisposition for alcohol.  I am not\nstupid.  I am not a swine.  I know the drinking game from A to Z, and I\nhave used my judgment in drinking.  I never have to be put to bed.  Nor\ndo I stagger.  In short, I am a normal, average man; and I drink in the\nnormal, average way, as drinking goes.  And this is the very point: I am\nwriting of the effects of alcohol on the normal, average man.  I have no\nword to say for or about the microscopically unimportant excessivist, the\ndipsomaniac.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two types of drinkers.  There is the man\nwhom we all know, stupid, unimaginative, whose brain is bitten numbly by\nnumb maggots; who walks generously with wide-spread, tentative legs,\nfalls frequently in the gutter, and who sees, in the extremity of his\necstasy, blue mice and pink elephants.  He is the type that gives rise to\nthe jokes in the funny papers.\n\nThe other type of drinker has imagination, vision.  Even when most\npleasantly jingled, he walks straight and naturally, never staggers nor\nfalls, and knows just where he is and what he is doing.  It is not his\nbody but his brain that is drunken.  He may bubble with wit, or expand\nwith good fellowship.  Or he may see intellectual spectres and phantoms\nthat are cosmic and logical and that take the forms of syllogisms.  It is\nwhen in this condition that he strips away the husks of life's healthiest\nillusions and gravely considers the iron collar of necessity welded about\nthe neck of his soul.  This is the hour of John Barleycorn's subtlest\npower.  It is easy for any man to roll in the gutter.  But it is a\nterrible ordeal for a man to stand upright on his two legs unswaying, and\ndecide that in all the universe he finds for himself but one\nfreedom--namely, the anticipating of the day of his death.  With this man\nthis is the hour of the white logic (of which more anon), when he knows\nthat he may know only the laws of things--the meaning of things never.\nThis is his danger hour.  His feet are taking hold of the pathway that\nleads down into the grave.\n\nAll is clear to him.  All these baffling head-reaches after immortality\nare but the panics of souls frightened by the fear of death, and cursed\nwith the thrice-cursed gift of imagination.  They have not the instinct\nfor death; they lack the will to die when the time to die is at hand.\nThey trick themselves into believing they will outwit the game and win to\na future, leaving the other animals to the darkness of the grave or the\nannihilating heats of the crematory.  But he, this man in the hour of his\nwhite logic, knows that they trick and outwit themselves.  The one event\nhappeneth to all alike.  There is no new thing under the sun, not even\nthat yearned-for bauble of feeble souls--immortality.  But he knows, HE\nknows, standing upright on his two legs unswaying.  He is compounded of\nmeat and wine and sparkle, of sun-mote and world-dust, a frail mechanism\nmade to run for a span, to be tinkered at by doctors of divinity and\ndoctors of physic, and to be flung into the scrap-heap at the end.\n\nOf course, all this is soul-sickness, life-sickness.  It is the penalty\nthe imaginative man must pay for his friendship with John Barleycorn.\nThe penalty paid by the stupid man is simpler, easier.  He drinks himself\ninto sottish unconsciousness.  He sleeps a drugged sleep, and, if he\ndream, his dreams are dim and inarticulate.  But to the imaginative man,\nJohn Barleycorn sends the pitiless, spectral syllogisms of the white\nlogic.  He looks upon life and all its affairs with the jaundiced eye of\na pessimistic German philosopher.  He sees through all illusions.  He\ntransvalues all values.  Good is bad, truth is a cheat, and life is a\njoke.  From his calm-mad heights, with the certitude of a god, he beholds\nall life as evil.  Wife, children, friends--in the clear, white light of\nhis logic they are exposed as frauds and shams.  He sees through them,\nand all that he sees is their frailty, their meagreness, their\nsordidness, their pitifulness.  No longer do they fool him.  They are\nmiserable little egotisms, like all the other little humans, fluttering\ntheir May-fly life-dance of an hour.  They are without freedom.  They are\npuppets of chance.  So is he.  He realises that.  But there is one\ndifference.  He sees; he knows.  And he knows his one freedom: he may\nanticipate the day of his death.  All of which is not good for a man who\nis made to live and love and be loved.  Yet suicide, quick or slow, a\nsudden spill or a gradual oozing away through the years, is the price\nJohn Barleycorn exacts.  No friend of his ever escapes making the just,\ndue payment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nI was five years old the first time I got drunk.  It was on a hot day,\nand my father was ploughing in the field.  I was sent from the house,\nhalf a mile away, to carry to him a pail of beer.  \"And be sure you don't\nspill it,\" was the parting injunction.\n\nIt was, as I remember it, a lard pail, very wide across the top, and\nwithout a cover.  As I toddled along, the beer slopped over the rim upon\nmy legs.  And as I toddled, I pondered.  Beer was a very precious thing.\nCome to think of it, it must be wonderfully good.  Else why was I never\npermitted to drink of it in the house?  Other things kept from me by the\ngrown-ups I had found good.  Then this, too, was good.  Trust the\ngrown-ups.  They knew.  And, anyway, the pail was too full.  I was\nslopping it against my legs and spilling it on the ground.  Why waste it?\nAnd no one would know whether I had drunk or spilled it.\n\nI was so small that, in order to negotiate the pail, I sat down and\ngathered it into my lap.  First I sipped the foam.  I was disappointed.\nThe preciousness evaded me.  Evidently it did not reside in the foam.\nBesides, the taste was not good.  Then I remembered seeing the grown-ups\nblow the foam away before they drank.  I buried my face in the foam and\nlapped the solid liquid beneath.  It wasn't good at all.  But still I\ndrank.  The grown-ups knew what they were about.  Considering my\ndiminutiveness, the size of the pail in my lap, and my drinking out of it\nmy breath held and my face buried to the ears in foam, it was rather\ndifficult to estimate how much I drank.  Also, I was gulping it down like\nmedicine, in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over.\n\nI shuddered when I started on, and decided that the good taste would come\nafterward.  I tried several times more in the course of that long\nhalf-mile.  Then, astounded by the quantity of beer that was lacking, and\nremembering having seen stale beer made to foam afresh, I took a stick\nand stirred what was left till it foamed to the brim.\n\nAnd my father never noticed.  He emptied the pail with the wide thirst of\nthe sweating ploughman, returned it to me, and started up the plough.  I\nendeavoured to walk beside the horses.  I remember tottering and falling\nagainst their heels in front of the shining share, and that my father\nhauled back on the lines so violently that the horses nearly sat down on\nme.  He told me afterward that it was by only a matter of inches that I\nescaped disembowelling.  Vaguely, too, I remember, my father carried me\nin his arms to the trees on the edge of the field, while all the world\nreeled and swung about me, and I was aware of deadly nausea mingled with\nan appalling conviction of sin.\n\nI slept the afternoon away under the trees, and when my father roused me\nat sundown it was a very sick little boy that got up and dragged wearily\nhomeward.  I was exhausted, oppressed by the weight of my limbs, and in\nmy stomach was a harp-like vibrating that extended to my throat and\nbrain.  My condition was like that of one who had gone through a battle\nwith poison.  In truth, I had been poisoned.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed I had no more interest in beer than\nin the kitchen stove after it had burned me.  The grown-ups were right.\nBeer was not for children.  The grown-ups didn't mind it; but neither did\nthey mind taking pills and castor oil.  As for me, I could manage to get\nalong quite well without beer.  Yes, and to the day of my death I could\nhave managed to get along quite well without it.  But circumstance\ndecreed otherwise.  At every turn in the world in which I lived, John\nBarleycorn beckoned.  There was no escaping him.  All paths led to him.\nAnd it took twenty years of contact, of exchanging greetings and passing\non with my tongue in my cheek, to develop in me a sneaking liking for the\nrascal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nMy next bout with John Barleycorn occurred when I was seven.  This time\nmy imagination was at fault, and I was frightened into the encounter.\nStill farming, my family had moved to a ranch on the bleak sad coast of\nSan Mateo County, south of San Francisco.  It was a wild, primitive\ncountryside in those days; and often I heard my mother pride herself that\nwe were old American stock and not immigrant Irish and Italians like our\nneighbours.  In all our section there was only one other old American\nfamily.\n\nOne Sunday morning found me, how or why I cannot now remember, at the\nMorrisey ranch.  A number of young people had gathered there from the\nnearer ranches.  Besides, the oldsters had been there, drinking since\nearly dawn, and, some of them, since the night before.  The Morriseys\nwere a huge breed, and there were many strapping great sons and uncles,\nheavy-booted, big-fisted, rough-voiced.\n\nSuddenly there were screams from the girls and cries of \"Fight!\" There\nwas a rush.  Men hurled themselves out of the kitchen.  Two giants,\nflush-faced, with greying hair, were locked in each other's arms.  One\nwas Black Matt, who, everybody said, had killed two men in his time.  The\nwomen screamed softly, crossed themselves, or prayed brokenly, hiding\ntheir eyes and peeping through their fingers.  But not I.  It is a fair\npresumption that I was the most interested spectator.  Maybe I would see\nthat wonderful thing, a man killed.  Anyway, I would see a man-fight.\nGreat was my disappointment.  Black Matt and Tom Morrisey merely held on\nto each other and lifted their clumsy-booted feet in what seemed a\ngrotesque, elephantine dance.  They were too drunk to fight.  Then the\npeacemakers got hold of them and led them back to cement the new\nfriendship in the kitchen.\n\nSoon they were all talking at once, rumbling and roaring as big-chested\nopen-air men will, when whisky has whipped their taciturnity.  And I, a\nlittle shaver of seven, my heart in my mouth, my trembling body strung\ntense as a deer's on the verge of flight, peered wonderingly in at the\nopen door and learned more of the strangeness of men.  And I marvelled at\nBlack Matt and Tom Morrisey, sprawled over the table, arms about each\nother's necks, weeping lovingly.\n\nThe kitchen-drinking continued, and the girls outside grew timorous.\nThey knew the drink game, and all were certain that something terrible\nwas going to happen.  They protested that they did not wish to be there\nwhen it happened, and some one suggested going to a big Italian rancho\nfour miles away, where they could get up a dance.  Immediately they\npaired off, lad and lassie, and started down the sandy road.  And each\nlad walked with his sweetheart--trust a child of seven to listen and to\nknow the love-affairs of his countryside.  And behold, I, too, was a lad\nwith a lassie.  A little Irish girl of my own age had been paired off\nwith me.  We were the only children in this spontaneous affair.  Perhaps\nthe oldest couple might have been twenty.  There were chits of girls,\nquite grown up, of fourteen and sixteen, walking with their fellows.  But\nwe were uniquely young, this little Irish girl and I, and we walked hand\nin hand, and, sometimes, under the tutelage of our elders, with my arm\naround her waist.  Only that wasn't comfortable.  And I was very proud,\non that bright Sunday morning, going down the long bleak road among the\nsandhills.  I, too, had my girl, and was a little man.\n\nThe Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.  Our visit was hailed\nwith delight.  The red wine was poured in tumblers for all, and the long\ndining-room was partly cleared for dancing.  And the young fellows drank\nand danced with the girls to the strains of an accordion.  To me that\nmusic was divine.  I had never heard anything so glorious.  The young\nItalian who furnished it would even get up and dance, his arms around his\ngirl, playing the accordion behind her back.  All of which was very\nwonderful for me, who did not dance, but who sat at a table and gazed\nwide-eyed at the amazingness of life.  I was only a little lad, and there\nwas so much of life for me to learn.  As the time passed, the Irish lads\nbegan helping themselves to the wine, and jollity and high spirits\nreigned.  I noted that some of them staggered and fell down in the\ndances, and that one had gone to sleep in a corner.  Also, some of the\ngirls were complaining, and wanting to leave, and others of the girls\nwere titteringly complacent, willing for anything to happen.\n\nWhen our Italian hosts had offered me wine in a general sort of way, I\nhad declined.  My beer experience had been enough for me, and I had no\ninclination to traffic further in the stuff, or in anything related to\nit.  Unfortunately, one young Italian, Peter, an impish soul, seeing me\nsitting solitary, stirred by a whim of the moment, half-filled a tumbler\nwith wine and passed it to me.  He was sitting across the table from me.\nI declined.  His face grew stern, and he insistently proffered the wine.\nAnd then terror descended upon me--a terror which I must explain.\n\nMy mother had theories.  First, she steadfastly maintained that brunettes\nand all the tribe of dark-eyed humans were deceitful.  Needless to say,\nmy mother was a blonde.  Next, she was convinced that the dark-eyed Latin\nraces were profoundly sensitive, profoundly treacherous, and profoundly\nmurderous.  Again and again, drinking in the strangeness and the\nfearsomeness of the world from her lips, I had heard her state that if\none offended an Italian, no matter how slightly and unintentionally, he\nwas certain to retaliate by stabbing one in the back.  That was her\nparticular phrase--\"stab you in the back.\"\n\nNow, although I had been eager to see Black Matt kill Tom Morrisey that\nmorning, I did not care to furnish to the dancers the spectacle of a\nknife sticking in my back.  I had not yet learned to distinguish between\nfacts and theories.  My faith was implicit in my mother's exposition of\nthe Italian character.  Besides, I had some glimmering inkling of the\nsacredness of hospitality.  Here was a treacherous, sensitive, murderous\nItalian, offering me hospitality.  I had been taught to believe that if I\noffended him he would strike at me with a knife precisely as a horse\nkicked out when one got too close to its heels and worried it.  Then,\ntoo, this Italian, Peter, had those terrible black eyes I had heard my\nmother talk about.  They were eyes different from the eyes I knew, from\nthe blues and greys and hazels of my own family, from the pale and genial\nblues of the Irish.  Perhaps Peter had had a few drinks.  At any rate,\nhis eyes were brilliantly black and sparkling with devilry.  They were\nthe mysterious, the unknown, and who was I, a seven-year-old, to analyse\nthem and know their prankishness? In them I visioned sudden death, and I\ndeclined the wine half-heartedly.  The expression in his eyes changed.\nThey grew stern and imperious as he shoved the tumbler of wine closer.\n\nWhat could I do? I have faced real death since in my life, but never have\nI known the fear of death as I knew it then.  I put the glass to my lips,\nand Peter's eyes relented.  I knew he would not kill me just then.  That\nwas a relief.  But the wine was not.  It was cheap, new wine, bitter and\nsour, made of the leavings and scrapings of the vineyards and the vats,\nand it tasted far worse than beer.  There is only one way to take\nmedicine, and that is to take it.  And that is the way I took that wine.\nI threw my head back and gulped it down.  I had to gulp again and hold\nthe poison down, for poison it was to my child's tissues and membranes.\n\nLooking back now, I can realise that Peter was astounded.  He half-filled\na second tumbler and shoved it across the table.  Frozen with fear, in\ndespair at the fate which had befallen me, I gulped the second glass down\nlike the first.  This was too much for Peter.  He must share the infant\nprodigy he had discovered.  He called Dominick, a young moustached\nItalian, to see the sight.  This time it was a full tumbler that was\ngiven me.  One will do anything to live.  I gripped myself, mastered the\nqualms that rose in my throat, and downed the stuff.\n\nDominick had never seen an infant of such heroic calibre.  Twice again he\nrefilled the tumbler, each time to the brim, and watched it disappear\ndown my throat.  By this time my exploits were attracting attention.\nMiddle-aged Italian labourers, old-country peasants who did not talk\nEnglish, and who could not dance with the Irish girls, surrounded me.\nThey were swarthy and wild-looking; they wore belts and red shirts; and I\nknew they carried knives; and they ringed me around like a pirate chorus.\nAnd Peter and Dominick made me show off for them.\n\nHad I lacked imagination, had I been stupid, had I been stubbornly mulish\nin having my own way, I should never have got in this pickle.  And the\nlads and lassies were dancing, and there was no one to save me from my\nfate.  How much I drank I do not know.  My memory of it is of an age-long\nsuffering of fear in the midst of a murderous crew, and of an infinite\nnumber of glasses of red wine passing across the bare boards of a\nwine-drenched table and going down my burning throat.  Bad as the wine\nwas, a knife in the back was worse, and I must survive at any cost.\n\nLooking back with the drinker's knowledge, I know now why I did not\ncollapse stupefied upon the table.  As I have said, I was frozen, I was\nparalysed, with fear.  The only movement I made was to convey that\nnever-ending procession of glasses to my lips.  I was a poised and\nmotionless receptacle for all that quantity of wine.  It lay inert in my\nfear-inert stomach.  I was too frightened, even, for my stomach to turn.\nSo all that Italian crew looked on and marvelled at the infant phenomenon\nthat downed wine with the sang-froid of an automaton.  It is not in the\nspirit of braggadocio that I dare to assert they had never seen anything\nlike it.\n\nThe time came to go.  The tipsy antics of the lads had led a majority of\nthe soberer-minded lassies to compel a departure.  I found myself, at the\ndoor, beside my little maiden.  She had not had my experience, so she was\nsober.  She was fascinated by the titubations of the lads who strove to\nwalk beside their girls, and began to mimic them.  I thought this a great\ngame, and I, too, began to stagger tipsily.  But she had no wine to stir\nup, while my movements quickly set the fumes rising to my head.  Even at\nthe start, I was more realistic than she.  In several minutes I was\nastonishing myself.  I saw one lad, after reeling half a dozen steps,\npause at the side of the road, gravely peer into the ditch, and gravely,\nand after apparent deep thought, fall into it.  To me this was\nexcruciatingly funny.  I staggered to the edge of the ditch, fully\nintending to stop on the edge.  I came to myself, in the ditch, in\nprocess of being hauled out by several anxious-faced girls.\n\nI didn't care to play at being drunk any more.  There was no more fun in\nme.  My eyes were beginning to swim, and with wide-open mouth I panted\nfor air.  A girl led me by the hand on either side, but my legs were\nleaden.  The alcohol I had drunk was striking my heart and brain like a\nclub.  Had I been a weakling of a child, I am confident that it would\nhave killed me.  As it was, I know I was nearer death than any of the\nscared girls dreamed.  I could hear them bickering among themselves as to\nwhose fault it was; some were weeping--for themselves, for me, and for\nthe disgraceful way their lads had behaved.  But I was not interested.  I\nwas suffocating, and I wanted air.  To move was agony.  It made me pant\nharder.  Yet those girls persisted in making me walk, and it was four\nmiles home.  Four miles! I remember my swimming eyes saw a small bridge\nacross the road an infinite distance away.  In fact, it was not a hundred\nfeet distant.  When I reached it, I sank down and lay on my back panting.\nThe girls tried to lift me, but I was helpless and suffocating.  Their\ncries of alarm brought Larry, a drunken youth of seventeen, who proceeded\nto resuscitate me by jumping on my chest.  Dimly I remember this, and the\nsqualling of the girls as they struggled with him and dragged him away.\nAnd then I knew nothing, though I learned afterward that Larry wound up\nunder the bridge and spent the night there.\n\nWhen I came to, it was dark.  I had been carried unconscious for four\nmiles and been put to bed.  I was a sick child, and, despite the terrible\nstrain on my heart and tissues, I continually relapsed into the madness\nof delirium.  All the contents of the terrible and horrible in my child's\nmind spilled out.  The most frightful visions were realities to me.  I\nsaw murders committed, and I was pursued by murderers.  I screamed and\nraved and fought.  My sufferings were prodigious.  Emerging from such\ndelirium, I would hear my mother's voice: \"But the child's brain.  He\nwill lose his reason.\" And sinking back into delirium, I would take the\nidea with me and be immured in madhouses, and be beaten by keepers, and\nsurrounded by screeching lunatics.\n\nOne thing that had strongly impressed my young mind was the talk of my\nelders about the dens of iniquity in San Francisco's Chinatown.  In my\ndelirium I wandered deep beneath the ground through a thousand of these\ndens, and behind locked doors of iron I suffered and died a thousand\ndeaths.  And when I would come upon my father, seated at table in these\nsubterranean crypts, gambling with Chinese for great stakes of gold, all\nmy outrage gave vent in the vilest cursing.  I would rise in bed,\nstruggling against the detaining hands, and curse my father till the\nrafters rang.  All the inconceivable filth a child running at large in a\nprimitive countryside may hear men utter was mine; and though I had never\ndared utter such oaths, they now poured from me, at the top of my lungs,\nas I cursed my father sitting there underground and gambling with\nlong-haired, long-nailed Chinamen.\n\nIt is a wonder that I did not burst my heart or brain that night.  A\nseven-year-old child's arteries and nerve-centres are scarcely fitted to\nendure the terrific paroxysms that convulsed me.  No one slept in the\nthin, frame farm-house that night when John Barleycorn had his will of\nme.  And Larry, under the bridge, had no delirium like mine.  I am\nconfident that his sleep was stupefied and dreamless, and that he awoke\nnext day merely to heaviness and moroseness, and that if he lives to-day\nhe does not remember that night, so passing was it as an incident.  But\nmy brain was seared for ever by that experience.  Writing now, thirty\nyears afterward, every vision is as distinct, as sharp-cut, every pain as\nvital and terrible, as on that night.\n\nI was sick for days afterward, and I needed none of my mother's\ninjunctions to avoid John Barleycorn in the future.  My mother had been\ndreadfully shocked.  She held that I had done wrong, very wrong, and that\nI had gone contrary to all her teaching.  And how was I, who was never\nallowed to talk back, who lacked the very words with which to express my\npsychology--how was I to tell my mother that it was her teaching that was\ndirectly responsible for my drunkenness? Had it not been for her theories\nabout dark eyes and Italian character, I should never have wet my lips\nwith the sour, bitter wine.  And not until man-grown did I tell her the\ntrue inwardness of that disgraceful affair.\n\nIn those after days of sickness, I was confused on some points, and very\nclear on others.  I felt guilty of sin, yet smarted with a sense of\ninjustice.  It had not been my fault, yet I had done wrong.  But very\nclear was my resolution never to touch liquor again.  No mad dog was ever\nmore afraid of water than was I of alcohol.\n\nYet the point I am making is that this experience, terrible as it was,\ncould not in the end deter me from forming John Barleycorn's\ncheek-by-jowl acquaintance.  All about me, even then, were the forces\nmoving me toward him.  In the first place, barring my mother, ever\nextreme in her views, it seemed to me all the grown-ups looked upon the\naffair with tolerant eyes.  It was a joke, something funny that had\nhappened.  There was no shame attached.  Even the lads and lassies\ngiggled and snickered over their part in the affair, narrating with gusto\nhow Larry had jumped on my chest and slept under the bridge, how\nSo-and-So had slept out in the sandhills that night, and what had\nhappened to the other lad who fell in the ditch.  As I say, so far as I\ncould see, there was no shame anywhere.  It had been something\nticklishly, devilishly fine--a bright and gorgeous episode in the\nmonotony of life and labour on that bleak, fog-girt coast.\n\nThe Irish ranchers twitted me good-naturedly on my exploit, and patted me\non the back until I felt that I had done something heroic.  Peter and\nDominick and the other Italians were proud of my drinking prowess.  The\nface of morality was not set against drinking.  Besides, everybody drank.\nThere was not a teetotaler in the community.  Even the teacher of our\nlittle country school, a greying man of fifty, gave us vacations on the\noccasions when he wrestled with John Barleycorn and was thrown.  Thus\nthere was no spiritual deterrence.  My loathing for alcohol was purely\nphysiological.  I didn't like the damned stuff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThis physical loathing for alcohol I have never got over.  But I have\nconquered it.  To this day I conquer it every time I take a drink.  The\npalate never ceases to rebel, and the palate can be trusted to know what\nis good for the body.  But men do not drink for the effect alcohol\nproduces on the body.  What they drink for is the brain-effect; and if it\nmust come through the body, so much the worse for the body.\n\nAnd yet, despite my physical loathing for alcohol, the brightest spots in\nmy child life were the saloons.  Sitting on the heavy potato wagons,\nwrapped in fog, feet stinging from inactivity, the horses plodding slowly\nalong the deep road through the sandhills, one bright vision made the way\nnever too long.  The bright vision was the saloon at Colma, where my\nfather, or whoever drove, always got out to get a drink.  And I got out\nto warm by the great stove and get a soda cracker.  Just one soda\ncracker, but a fabulous luxury.  Saloons were good for something.  Back\nbehind the plodding horses, I would take an hour in consuming that one\ncracker.  I took the smallest nibbles, never losing a crumb, and chewed\nthe nibble till it became the thinnest and most delectable of pastes.  I\nnever voluntarily swallowed this paste.  I just tasted it, and went on\ntasting it, turning it over with my tongue, spreading it on the inside of\nthis cheek, then on the inside of the other cheek, until, at the end, it\neluded me and in tiny drops and oozelets, slipped and dribbled down my\nthroat.  Horace Fletcher had nothing on me when it came to soda crackers.\n\nI liked saloons.  Especially I liked the San Francisco saloons.  They had\nthe most delicious dainties for the taking--strange breads and crackers,\ncheeses, sausages, sardines--wonderful foods that I never saw on our\nmeagre home-table.  And once, I remember, a barkeeper mixed me a sweet\ntemperance drink of syrup and soda-water.  My father did not pay for it.\nIt was the barkeeper's treat, and he became my ideal of a good, kind man.\nI dreamed day-dreams of him for years.  Although I was seven years old at\nthe time, I can see him now with undiminished clearness, though I never\nlaid eyes on him but that one time.  The saloon was south of Market\nStreet in San Francisco.  It stood on the west side of the street.  As\nyou entered, the bar was on the left.  On the right, against the wall,\nwas the free lunch counter.  It was a long, narrow room, and at the rear,\nbeyond the beer kegs on tap, were small, round tables and chairs.  The\nbarkeeper was blue-eyed, and had fair, silky hair peeping out from under\na black silk skull-cap.  I remember he wore a brown Cardigan jacket, and\nI know precisely the spot, in the midst of the array of bottles, from\nwhich he took the bottle of red-coloured syrup.  He and my father talked\nlong, and I sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him.  And for years\nafterward I worshipped the memory of him.\n\nDespite my two disastrous experiences, here was John Barleycorn,\nprevalent and accessible everywhere in the community, luring and drawing\nme.  Here were connotations of the saloon making deep indentations in a\nchild's mind.  Here was a child, forming its first judgments of the\nworld, finding the saloon a delightful and desirable place.  Stores, nor\npublic buildings, nor all the dwellings of men ever opened their doors to\nme and let me warm by their fires or permitted me to eat the food of the\ngods from narrow shelves against the wall.  Their doors were ever closed\nto me; the saloon's doors were ever open.  And always and everywhere I\nfound saloons, on highway and byway, up narrow alleys and on busy\nthoroughfares, bright-lighted and cheerful, warm in winter, and in summer\ndark and cool.  Yes, the saloon was a mighty fine place, and it was more\nthan that.\n\nBy the time I was ten years old, my family had abandoned ranching and\ngone to live in the city.  And here, at ten, I began on the streets as a\nnewsboy.  One of the reasons for this was that we needed the money.\nAnother reason was that I needed the exercise.  I had found my way to the\nfree public library, and was reading myself into nervous prostration.  On\nthe poor ranches on which I had lived there had been no books.  In ways\ntruly miraculous, I had been lent four books, marvellous books, and them\nI had devoured.  One was the life of Garfield; the second, Paul du\nChaillu's African travels; the third, a novel by Ouida with the last\nforty pages missing; and the fourth, Irving's \"Alhambra.\" This last had\nbeen lent me by a school-teacher.  I was not a forward child.  Unlike\nOliver Twist, I was incapable of asking for more.  When I returned the\n\"Alhambra\" to the teacher I hoped she would lend me another book.  And\nbecause she did not--most likely she deemed me unappreciative--I cried\nall the way home on the three-mile tramp from the school to the ranch. I\nwaited and yearned for her to lend me another book.  Scores of times I\nnerved myself almost to the point of asking her, but never quite reached\nthe necessary pitch of effrontery.\n\nAnd then came the city of Oakland, and on the shelves of that free\nlibrary I discovered all the great world beyond the skyline.  Here were\nthousands of books as good as my four wonder-books, and some were even\nbetter.  Libraries were not concerned with children in those days, and I\nhad strange adventures.  I remember, in the catalogue, being impressed by\nthe title, \"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle.\" I filled an application\nblank and the librarian handed me the collected and entirely unexpurgated\nworks of Smollett in one huge volume.  I read everything, but principally\nhistory and adventure, and all the old travels and voyages.  I read\nmornings, afternoons, and nights.  I read in bed, I read at table, I read\nas I walked to and from school, and I read at recess while the other boys\nwere playing.  I began to get the \"jerks.\" To everybody I replied: \"Go\naway.  You make me nervous.\"\n\nAnd so, at ten, I was out on the streets, a newsboy.  I had no time to\nread.  I was busy getting exercise and learning how to fight, busy\nlearning forwardness, and brass and bluff.  I had an imagination and a\ncuriosity about all things that made me plastic.  Not least among the\nthings I was curious about was the saloon.  And I was in and out of many\na one.  I remember, in those days, on the east side of Broadway, between\nSixth and Seventh, from corner to corner, there was a solid block of\nsaloons.\n\nIn the saloons life was different.  Men talked with great voices, laughed\ngreat laughs, and there was an atmosphere of greatness.  Here was\nsomething more than common every-day where nothing happened.  Here life\nwas always very live, and, sometimes, even lurid, when blows were struck,\nand blood was shed, and big policemen came shouldering in.  Great\nmoments, these, for me, my head filled with all the wild and valiant\nfighting of the gallant adventurers on sea and land.  There were no big\nmoments when I trudged along the street throwing my papers in at doors.\nBut in the saloons, even the sots, stupefied, sprawling across the tables\nor in the sawdust, were objects of mystery and wonder.\n\nAnd more, the saloons were right.  The city fathers sanctioned them and\nlicensed them.  They were not the terrible places I heard boys deem them\nwho lacked my opportunities to know.  Terrible they might be, but then\nthat only meant they were terribly wonderful, and it is the terribly\nwonderful that a boy desires to know.  In the same way pirates, and\nshipwrecks, and battles were terrible; and what healthy boy wouldn't give\nhis immortal soul to participate in such affairs?\n\nBesides, in saloons I saw reporters, editors, lawyers, judges, whose\nnames and faces I knew.  They put the seal of social approval on the\nsaloon.  They verified my own feeling of fascination in the saloon.\nThey, too, must have found there that something different, that something\nbeyond, which I sensed and groped after.  What it was, I did not know;\nyet there it must be, for there men focused like buzzing flies about a\nhoney pot.  I had no sorrows, and the world was very bright, so I could\nnot guess that what these men sought was forgetfulness of jaded toil and\nstale grief.\n\nNot that I drank at that time.  From ten to fifteen I rarely tasted\nliquor, but I was intimately in contact with drinkers and drinking\nplaces.  The only reason I did not drink was because I didn't like the\nstuff.  As the time passed, I worked as boy-helper on an ice-wagon, set\nup pins in a bowling alley with a saloon attached, and swept out saloons\nat Sunday picnic grounds.\n\nBig jovial Josie Harper ran a road house at Telegraph Avenue and\nThirty-ninth Street.  Here for a year I delivered an evening paper, until\nmy route was changed to the water-front and tenderloin of Oakland.  The\nfirst month, when I collected Josie Harper's bill, she poured me a glass\nof wine.  I was ashamed to refuse, so I drank it.  But after that I\nwatched the chance when she wasn't around so as to collect from her\nbarkeeper.\n\nThe first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper, according to\ncustom, called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up\npins for several hours.  The others asked for beer.  I said I'd take\nginger ale.  The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me\nwith a strange, searching scrutiny.  Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of\nginger ale.  Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games,\nthe boys enlightened me.  I had offended the barkeeper.  A bottle of\nginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer;\nand it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer.  Besides,\nbeer was food.  I could work better on it.  There was no food in ginger\nale.  After that, when I couldn't sneak out of it, I drank beer and\nwondered what men found in it that was so good.  I was always aware that\nI was missing something.\n\nWhat I really liked in those days was candy. For five cents I could buy\nfive \"cannon-balls\"--big lumps of the most delicious lastingness.  I\ncould chew and worry a single one for an hour.  Then there was a Mexican\nwho sold big slabs of brown chewing taffy for five cents each.  It\nrequired a quarter of a day properly to absorb one of them.  And many a\nday I made my entire lunch off one of those slabs.  In truth, I found\nfood there, but not in beer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nBut the time was rapidly drawing near when I was to begin my second\nseries of bouts with John Barleycorn.  When I was fourteen, my head\nfilled with the tales of the old voyagers, my vision with tropic isles\nand far sea-rims, I was sailing a small centreboard skiff around San\nFrancisco Bay and on the Oakland Estuary.  I wanted to go to sea.  I\nwanted to get away from monotony and the commonplace.  I was in the\nflower of my adolescence, a-thrill with romance and adventure, dreaming\nof wild life in the wild man-world.  Little I guessed how all the warp\nand woof of that man-world was entangled with alcohol.\n\nSo, one day, as I hoisted sail on my skiff, I met Scotty.  He was a husky\nyoungster of seventeen, a runaway apprentice, he told me, from an English\nship in Australia.  He had just worked his way on another ship to San\nFrancisco; and now he wanted to see about getting a berth on a whaler.\nAcross the estuary, near where the whalers lay, was lying the sloop-yacht\nIdler.  The caretaker was a harpooner who intended sailing next voyage on\nthe whale ship Bonanza.  Would I take him, Scotty, over in my skiff to\ncall upon the harpooner?\n\nWould I! Hadn't I heard the stories and rumours about the Idler?--the big\nsloop that had come up from the Sandwich Islands where it had been\nengaged in smuggling opium.  And the harpooner who was caretaker! How\noften had I seen him and envied him his freedom.  He never had to leave\nthe water.  He slept aboard the Idler each night, while I had to go home\nupon the land to go to bed.  The harpooner was only nineteen years old\n(and I have never had anything but his own word that he was a harpooner);\nbut he had been too shining and glorious a personality for me ever to\naddress as I paddled around the yacht at a wistful distance.  Would I\ntake Scotty, the runaway sailor, to visit the harpooner, on the\nopium-smuggler Idler?  WOULD I!\n\nThe harpooner came on deck to answer our hail, and invited us aboard.  I\nplayed the sailor and the man, fending off the skiff so that it would not\nmar the yacht's white paint, dropping the skiff astern on a long painter,\nand making the painter fast with two nonchalant half-hitches.\n\nWe went below.  It was the first sea-interior I had ever seen.  The\nclothing on the wall smelled musty.  But what of that? Was it not the\nsea-gear of men?--leather jackets lined with corduroy, blue coats of\npilot cloth, sou'westers, sea-boots, oilskins.  And everywhere was in\nevidence the economy of space--the narrow bunks, the swinging tables, the\nincredible lockers.  There were the tell-tale compass, the sea-lamps in\ntheir gimbals, the blue-backed charts carelessly rolled and tucked away,\nthe signal-flags in alphabetical order, and a mariner's dividers jammed\ninto the woodwork to hold a calendar.  At last I was living.  Here I sat,\ninside my first ship, a smuggler, accepted as a comrade by a harpooner\nand a runaway English sailor who said his name was Scotty.\n\nThe first thing that the harpooner, aged nineteen, and the sailor, aged\nseventeen, did to show that they were men was to behave like men.  The\nharpooner suggested the eminent desirableness of a drink, and Scotty\nsearched his pockets for dimes and nickels.  Then the harpooner carried\naway a pink flask to be filled in some blind pig, for there were no\nlicensed saloons in that locality.  We drank the cheap rotgut out of\ntumblers.  Was I any the less strong, any the less valiant, than the\nharpooner and the sailor?  They were men.  They proved it by the way they\ndrank.  Drink was the badge of manhood.  So I drank with them, drink by\ndrink, raw and straight, though the damned stuff couldn't compare with a\nstick of chewing taffy or a delectable \"cannon-ball.\" I shuddered and\nswallowed my gorge with every drink, though I manfully hid all such\nsymptoms.\n\nDivers times we filled the flask that afternoon.  All I had was twenty\ncents, but I put it up like a man, though with secret regret at the\nenormous store of candy it could have bought.  The liquor mounted in the\nheads of all of us, and the talk of Scotty and the harpooner was upon\nrunning the Easting down, gales off the Horn and pamperos off the Plate,\nlower topsail breezes, southerly busters, North Pacific gales, and of\nsmashed whaleboats in the Arctic ice.\n\n\"You can't swim in that ice water,\" said the harpooner confidentially to\nme.  \"You double up in a minute and go down.  When a whale smashes your\nboat, the thing to do is to get your belly across an oar, so that when\nthe cold doubles you you'll float.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, with a grateful nod and an air of certitude that I, too,\nwould hunt whales and be in smashed boats in the Arctic Ocean.  And,\ntruly, I registered his advice as singularly valuable information, and\nfiled it away in my brain, where it persists to this day.\n\nBut I couldn't talk--at first.  Heavens! I was only fourteen, and had\nnever been on the ocean in my life.  I could only listen to the two\nsea-dogs, and show my manhood by drinking with them, fairly and squarely,\ndrink and drink.\n\nThe liquor worked its will with me; the talk of Scotty and the harpooner\npoured through the pent space of the Idler's cabin and through my brain\nlike great gusts of wide, free wind; and in imagination I lived my years\nto come and rocked over the wild, mad, glorious world on multitudinous\nadventures.\n\nWe unbent.  Our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished.  We were as if we\nhad known each other for years and years, and we pledged ourselves to\nyears of future voyagings together.  The harpooner told of misadventures\nand secret shames.  Scotty wept over his poor old mother in Edinburgh--a\nlady, he insisted, gently born--who was in reduced circumstances, who had\npinched herself to pay the lump sum to the ship-owners for his\napprenticeship, whose sacrificing dream had been to see him a merchantman\nofficer and a gentleman, and who was heartbroken because he had deserted\nhis ship in Australia and joined another as a common sailor before the\nmast.  And Scotty proved it.  He drew her last sad letter from his pocket\nand wept over it as he read it aloud.  The harpooner and I wept with him,\nand swore that all three of us would ship on the whaleship Bonanza, win a\nbig pay-day, and, still together, make a pilgrimage to Edinburgh and lay\nour store of money in the dear lady's lap.\n\nAnd, as John Barleycorn heated his way into my brain, thawing my\nreticence, melting my modesty, talking through me and with me and as me,\nmy adopted twin brother and alter ego, I, too, raised my voice to show\nmyself a man and an adventurer, and bragged in detail and at length of\nhow I had crossed San Francisco Bay in my open skiff in a roaring\nsouthwester when even the schooner sailors doubted my exploit.  Further,\nI--or John Barleycorn, for it was the same thing--told Scotty that he\nmight be a deep-sea sailor and know the last rope on the great deep-sea\nships, but that when it came to small-boat sailing I could beat him hands\ndown and sail circles around him.\n\nThe best of it was that my assertion and brag were true.  With reticence\nand modesty present, I could never have dared tell Scotty my small-boat\nestimate of him.  But it is ever the way of John Barleycorn to loosen the\ntongue and babble the secret thought.\n\nScotty, or John Barleycorn, or the pair, was very naturally offended by\nmy remarks.  Nor was I loath.  I could whip any runaway sailor seventeen\nyears old.  Scotty and I flared and raged like young cockerels, until the\nharpooner poured another round of drinks to enable us to forgive and make\nup.  Which we did, arms around each other's necks, protesting vows of\neternal friendship--just like Black Matt and Tom Morrisey, I remembered,\nin the ranch kitchen in San Mateo.  And, remembering, I knew that I was\nat last a man--despite my meagre fourteen years--a man as big and manly\nas those two strapping giants who had quarrelled and made up on that\nmemorable Sunday morning of long ago.\n\nBy this time the singing stage was reached, and I joined Scotty and the\nharpooner in snatches of sea songs and chanties.  It was here, in the\ncabin of the Idler, that I first heard \"Blow the Man Down,\" \"Flying\nCloud,\" and \"Whisky, Johnny, Whisky.\" Oh, it was brave.  I was beginning\nto grasp the meaning of life.  Here was no commonplace, no Oakland\nEstuary, no weary round of throwing newspapers at front doors, delivering\nice, and setting up ninepins.  All the world was mine, all its paths were\nunder my feet, and John Barleycorn, tricking my fancy, enabled me to\nanticipate the life of adventure for which I yearned.\n\nWe were not ordinary.  We were three tipsy young gods, incredibly wise,\ngloriously genial, and without limit to our powers.  Ah!--and I say it\nnow, after the years--could John Barleycorn keep one at such a height, I\nshould never draw a sober breath again.  But this is not a world of free\nfreights.  One pays according to an iron schedule--for every strength the\nbalanced weakness; for every high a corresponding low; for every\nfictitious god-like moment an equivalent time in reptilian slime.  For\nevery feat of telescoping long days and weeks of life into mad\nmagnificent instants, one must pay with shortened life, and, oft-times,\nwith savage usury added.\n\nIntenseness and duration are as ancient enemies as fire and water.  They\nare mutually destructive.  They cannot co-exist.  And John Barleycorn,\nmighty necromancer though he be, is as much a slave to organic chemistry\nas we mortals are.  We pay for every nerve marathon we run, nor can John\nBarleycorn intercede and fend off the just payment.  He can lead us to\nthe heights, but he cannot keep us there, else would we all be devotees.\nAnd there is no devotee but pays for the mad dances John Barleycorn pipes.\n\nYet the foregoing is all in after wisdom spoken.  It was no part of the\nknowledge of the lad, fourteen years old, who sat in the Idler's cabin\nbetween the harpooner and the sailor, the air rich in his nostrils with\nthe musty smell of men's sea-gear, roaring in chorus: \"Yankee ship come\ndown de ribber--pull, my bully boys, pull!\"\n\nWe grew maudlin, and all talked and shouted at once.  I had a splendid\nconstitution, a stomach that would digest scrap-iron, and I was still\nrunning my marathon in full vigour when Scotty began to fail and fade.\nHis talk grew incoherent.  He groped for words and could not find them,\nwhile the ones he found his lips were unable to form.  His poisoned\nconsciousness was leaving him.  The brightness went out of his eyes, and\nhe looked as stupid as were his efforts to talk.  His face and body\nsagged as his consciousness sagged.  (A man cannot sit upright save by an\nact of will.)  Scotty's reeling brain could not control his muscles.  All\nhis correlations were breaking down.  He strove to take another drink,\nand feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor.  Then, to my amazement,\nweeping bitterly, he rolled into a bunk on his back and immediately\nsnored off to sleep.\n\nThe harpooner and I drank on, grinning in a superior way to each other\nover Scotty's plight.  The last flask was opened, and we drank it between\nus, to the accompaniment of Scotty's stertorous breathing.  Then the\nharpooner faded away into his bunk, and I was left alone, unthrown, on\nthe field of battle.\n\nI was very proud, and John Barleycorn was proud with me.  I could carry\nmy drink.  I was a man.  I had drunk two men, drink for drink, into\nunconsciousness.  And I was still on my two feet, upright, making my way\non deck to get air into my scorching lungs.  It was in this bout on the\nIdler that I discovered what a good stomach and a strong head I had for\ndrink--a bit of knowledge that was to be a source of pride in succeeding\nyears, and that ultimately I was to come to consider a great affliction.\nThe fortunate man is the one who cannot take more than a couple of drinks\nwithout becoming intoxicated.  The unfortunate wight is the one who can\ntake many glasses without betraying a sign, who must take numerous\nglasses in order to get the \"kick.\"\n\nThe sun was setting when I came on the Idler's deck.  There were plenty\nof bunks below.  I did not need to go home.  But I wanted to demonstrate\nto myself how much I was a man.  There lay my skiff astern.  The last of\na strong ebb was running out in channel in the teeth of an ocean breeze\nof forty miles an hour.  I could see the stiff whitecaps, and the suck\nand run of the current was plainly visible in the face and trough of each\none.\n\nI set sail, cast off, took my place at the tiller, the sheet in my hand,\nand headed across channel.  The skiff heeled over and plunged into it\nmadly.  The spray began to fly.  I was at the pinnacle of exaltation.  I\nsang \"Blow the Man Down\" as I sailed.  I was no boy of fourteen, living\nthe mediocre ways of the sleepy town called Oakland.  I was a man, a god,\nand the very elements rendered me allegiance as I bitted them to my will.\n\nThe tide was out.  A full hundred yards of soft mud intervened between\nthe boat-wharf and the water.  I pulled up my centreboard, ran full tilt\ninto the mud, took in sail, and, standing in the stern, as I had often\ndone at low tide, I began to shove the skiff with an oar.  It was then\nthat my correlations began to break down.  I lost my balance and pitched\nhead-foremost into the ooze.  Then, and for the first time, as I\nfloundered to my feet covered with slime, the blood running down my arms\nfrom a scrape against a barnacled stake, I knew that I was drunk.  But\nwhat of it? Across the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in\ntheir bunks where I had drunk them.  I WAS a man.  I was still on my\nlegs, if they were knee-deep in mud.  I disdained to get back into the\nskiff.  I waded through the mud, shoving the skiff before me and\nyammering the chant of my manhood to the world.\n\nI paid for it.  I was sick for a couple of days, meanly sick, and my arms\nwere painfully poisoned from the barnacle scratches.  For a week I could\nnot use them, and it was a torture to put on and take off my clothes.\n\nI swore, \"Never again!\" The game wasn't worth it.  The price was too\nstiff.  I had no moral qualms.  My revulsion was purely physical.  No\nexalted moments were worth such hours of misery and wretchedness.  When I\ngot back to my skiff, I shunned the Idler.  I would cross the opposite\nside of the channel to go around her.  Scotty had disappeared.  The\nharpooner was still about, but him I avoided.  Once, when he landed on\nthe boat-wharf, I hid in a shed so as to escape seeing him.  I was afraid\nhe would propose some more drinking, maybe have a flask full of whisky in\nhis pocket.\n\nAnd yet--and here enters the necromancy of John Barleycorn--that\nafternoon's drunk on the Idler had been a purple passage flung into the\nmonotony of my days.  It was memorable.  My mind dwelt on it continually.\nI went over the details, over and over again.  Among other things, I had\ngot into the cogs and springs of men's actions.  I had seen Scotty weep\nabout his own worthlessness and the sad case of his Edinburgh mother who\nwas a lady.  The harpooner had told me terribly wonderful things of\nhimself.  I had caught a myriad enticing and inflammatory hints of a\nworld beyond my world, and for which I was certainly as fitted as the two\nlads who had drunk with me.  I had got behind men's souls.  I had got\nbehind my own soul and found unguessed potencies and greatnesses.\n\nYes, that day stood out above all my other days.  To this day it so\nstands out.  The memory of it is branded in my brain.  But the price\nexacted was too high.  I refused to play and pay, and returned to my\ncannon-balls and taffy-slabs.  The point is that all the chemistry of my\nhealthy, normal body drove me away from alcohol.  The stuff didn't agree\nwith me.  It was abominable.  But, despite this, circumstance was to\ncontinue to drive me toward John Barleycorn, to drive me again and again,\nuntil, after long years, the time should come when I would look up John\nBarleycorn in every haunt of men--look him up and hail him gladly as\nbenefactor and friend.  And detest and hate him all the time.  Yes, he is\na strange friend, John Barleycorn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nI was barely turned fifteen, and working long hours in a cannery.  Month\nin and month out, the shortest day I ever worked was ten hours.  When to\nten hours of actual work at a machine is added the noon hour; the walking\nto work and walking home from work; the getting up in the morning,\ndressing, and eating; the eating at night, undressing, and going to bed,\nthere remains no more than the nine hours out of the twenty-four required\nby a healthy youngster for sleep.  Out of those nine hours, after I was\nin bed and ere my eyes drowsed shut, I managed to steal a little time for\nreading.\n\nBut many a night I did not knock off work until midnight.  On occasion I\nworked eighteen and twenty hours on a stretch.  Once I worked at my\nmachine for thirty-six consecutive hours.  And there were weeks on end\nwhen I never knocked off work earlier than eleven o'clock, got home and\nin bed at half after midnight, and was called at half-past five to dress,\neat, walk to work, and be at my machine at seven o'clock whistle blow.\n\nNo moments here to be stolen for my beloved books.  And what had John\nBarleycorn to do with such strenuous, Stoic toil of a lad just turned\nfifteen? He had everything to do with it.  Let me show you.  I asked\nmyself if this were the meaning of life--to be a work-beast? I knew of no\nhorse in the city of Oakland that worked the hours I worked.  If this\nwere living, I was entirely unenamoured of it.  I remembered my skiff,\nlying idle and accumulating barnacles at the boat-wharf; I remembered the\nwind that blew every day on the bay, the sunrises and sunsets I never\nsaw; the bite of the salt air in my nostrils, the bite of the salt water\non my flesh when I plunged overside; I remembered all the beauty and the\nwonder and the sense-delights of the world denied me.  There was only one\nway to escape my deadening toil.  I must get out and away on the water.\nI must earn my bread on the water.  And the way of the water led\ninevitably to John Barleycorn.  I did not know this.  And when I did\nlearn it, I was courageous enough not to retreat back to my bestial life\nat the machine.\n\nI wanted to be where the winds of adventure blew.  And the winds of\nadventure blew the oyster pirate sloops up and down San Francisco Bay,\nfrom raided oyster-beds and fights at night on shoal and flat, to markets\nin the morning against city wharves, where peddlers and saloon-keepers\ncame down to buy.  Every raid on an oyster-bed was a felony.  The penalty\nwas State imprisonment, the stripes and the lockstep.  And what of that?\nThe men in stripes worked a shorter day than I at my machine.  And there\nwas vastly more romance in being an oyster pirate or a convict than in\nbeing a machine slave.  And behind it all, behind all of me with youth\nabubble, whispered Romance, Adventure.\n\nSo I interviewed my Mammy Jennie, my old nurse at whose black breast I\nhad suckled.  She was more prosperous than my folks.  She was nursing\nsick people at a good weekly wage.  Would she lend her \"white child\" the\nmoney?  WOULD SHE?  What she had was mine.\n\nThen I sought out French Frank, the oyster pirate, who wanted to sell, I\nhad heard, his sloop, the Razzle Dazzle.  I found him lying at anchor on\nthe Alameda side of the estuary near the Webster Street bridge, with\nvisitors aboard, whom he was entertaining with afternoon wine.  He came\non deck to talk business.  He was willing to sell.  But it was Sunday.\nBesides, he had guests.  On the morrow he would make out the bill of sale\nand I could enter into possession. And in the meantime I must come below\nand meet his friends.  They were two sisters, Mamie and Tess; a Mrs.\nHadley, who chaperoned them; \"Whisky\" Bob, a youthful oyster pirate of\nsixteen; and \"Spider\" Healey, a black-whiskered wharf-rat of twenty.\nMamie, who was Spider's niece, was called the Queen of the Oyster\nPirates, and, on occasion, presided at their revels.  French Frank was in\nlove with her, though I did not know it at the time; and she steadfastly\nrefused to marry him.\n\nFrench Frank poured a tumbler of red wine from a big demijohn to drink to\nour transaction.  I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and\nshuddered inwardly.  Whisky and beer were not quite so repulsive.  But\nthe Queen of the Oyster Pirates was looking at me, a part-emptied glass\nin her own hand.  I had my pride.  If I was only fifteen, at least I\ncould not show myself any less a man than she.  Besides, there were her\nsister, and Mrs. Hadley, and the young oyster pirate, and the whiskered\nwharf-rat, all with glasses in their hands.  Was I a milk-and-water sop?\nNo; a thousand times no, and a thousand glasses no.  I downed the\ntumblerful like a man.\n\nFrench Frank was elated by the sale, which I had bound with a\ntwenty-dollar goldpiece.  He poured more wine.  I had learned my strong\nhead and stomach, and I was certain I could drink with them in a\ntemperate way and not poison myself for a week to come.  I could stand as\nmuch as they; and besides, they had already been drinking for some time.\n\nWe got to singing.  Spider sang \"The Boston Burglar\" and \"Black Lulu.\"\nThe Queen sang \"Then I Wisht I Were a Little Bird.\" And her sister Tess\nsang \"Oh, Treat My Daughter Kindily.\" The fun grew fast and furious.  I\nfound myself able to miss drinks without being noticed or called to\naccount.  Also, standing in the companionway, head and shoulders out and\nglass in hand, I could fling the wine overboard.\n\nI reasoned something like this: It is a queerness of these people that\nthey like this vile-tasting wine.  Well, let them.  I cannot quarrel with\ntheir tastes.  My manhood, according to their queer notions, must compel\nme to appear to like this wine.  Very well.  I shall so appear.  But I\nshall drink no more than is unavoidable.\n\nAnd the Queen began to make love to me, the latest recruit to the oyster\npirate fleet, and no mere hand, but a master and owner.  She went upon\ndeck to take the air, and took me with her.  She knew, of course, but I\nnever dreamed, how French Frank was raging down below.  Then Tess joined\nus, sitting on the cabin; and Spider, and Bob; and at the last, Mrs.\nHadley and French Frank.  And we sat there, glasses in hand, and sang,\nwhile the big demijohn went around; and I was the only strictly sober one.\n\nAnd I enjoyed it as no one of them was able to enjoy it.  Here, in this\natmosphere of bohemianism, I could not but contrast the scene with my\nscene of the day before, sitting at my machine, in the stifling, shut-in\nair, repeating, endlessly repeating, at top speed, my series of\nmechanical motions.  And here I sat now, glass in hand, in warm-glowing\ncamaraderie, with the oyster pirates, adventurers who refused to be\nslaves to petty routine, who flouted restrictions and the law, who\ncarried their lives and their liberty in their hands.  And it was through\nJohn Barleycorn that I came to join this glorious company of free souls,\nunashamed and unafraid.\n\nAnd the afternoon seabreeze blew its tang into my lungs, and curled the\nwaves in mid-channel.  Before it came the scow schooners, wing-and-wing,\nblowing their horns for the drawbridges to open.  Red-stacked tugs tore\nby, rocking the Razzle Dazzle in the waves of their wake.  A sugar barque\ntowed from the \"boneyard\" to sea.  The sun-wash was on the crisping\nwater, and life was big.  And Spider sang:\n\n    \"Oh, it's Lulu, black Lulu, my darling,\n       Oh, it's where have you been so long?\n          Been layin' in jail,\n          A-waitin' for bail,\n     Till my bully comes rollin' along.\"\n\n\nThere it was, the smack and slap of the spirit of revolt, of adventure,\nof romance, of the things forbidden and done defiantly and grandly.  And\nI knew that on the morrow I would not go back to my machine at the\ncannery.  To-morrow I would be an oyster pirate, as free a freebooter as\nthe century and the waters of San Francisco Bay would permit.  Spider had\nalready agreed to sail with me as my crew of one, and, also, as cook\nwhile I did the deck work.  We would outfit our grub and water in the\nmorning, hoist the big mainsail (which was a bigger piece of canvas than\nany I had ever sailed under), and beat our way out the estuary on the\nfirst of the seabreeze and the last of the ebb.  Then we would slack\nsheets, and on the first of the flood run down the bay to the Asparagus\nIslands, where we would anchor miles off shore.  And at last my dream\nwould be realised: I would sleep upon the water.  And next morning I\nwould wake upon the water; and thereafter all my days and nights would be\non the water.\n\nAnd the Queen asked me to row her ashore in my skiff, when at sunset\nFrench Frank prepared to take his guests ashore.  Nor did I catch the\nsignificance of his abrupt change of plan when he turned the task of\nrowing his skiff over to Whisky Bob, himself remaining on board the\nsloop.  Nor did I understand Spider's grinning side-remark to me: \"Gee!\nThere's nothin' slow about YOU.\" How could it possibly enter my boy's\nhead that a grizzled man of fifty should be jealous of me?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nWe met by appointment, early Monday morning, to complete the deal, in\nJohnny Heinhold's \"Last Chance \"--a saloon, of course, for the\ntransactions of men.  I paid the money over, received the bill of sale,\nand French Frank treated.  This struck me as an evident custom, and a\nlogical one--the seller, who receives the money, to wet a piece of it in\nthe establishment where the trade was consummated.  But, to my surprise,\nFrench Frank treated the house.  He and I drank, which seemed just; but\nwhy should Johnny Heinhold, who owned the saloon and waited behind the\nbar, be invited to drink? I figured it immediately that he made a profit\non the very drink he drank.  I could, in a way, considering that they\nwere friends and shipmates, understand Spider and Whisky Bob being asked\nto drink; but why should the longshoremen, Bill Kelley and Soup Kennedy,\nbe asked?\n\nThen there was Pat, the Queen's brother, making a total of eight of us.\nIt was early morning, and all ordered whisky.  What could I do, here in\nthis company of big men, all drinking whisky?  \"Whisky,\" I said, with the\ncareless air of one who had said it a thousand times.  And such whisky! I\ntossed it down.  A-r-r-r-gh! I can taste it yet.\n\nAnd I was appalled at the price French Frank had paid--eighty cents.\nEIGHTY CENTS!  It was an outrage to my thrifty soul.  Eighty cents--the\nequivalent of eight long hours of my toil at the machine, gone down our\nthroats, and gone like that, in a twinkling, leaving only a bad taste in\nthe mouth.  There was no discussion that French Frank was a waster.\n\nI was anxious to be gone, out into the sunshine, out over the water to my\nglorious boat.  But all hands lingered.  Even Spider, my crew, lingered.\nNo hint broke through my obtuseness of why they lingered.  I have often\nthought since of how they must have regarded me, the newcomer being\nwelcomed into their company standing at bar with them, and not standing\nfor a single round of drinks.\n\nFrench Frank, who, unknown to me, had swallowed his chagrin since the day\nbefore, now that the money for the Razzle Dazzle was in his pocket, began\nto behave curiously toward me.  I sensed the change in his attitude, saw\nthe forbidding glitter in his eyes, and wondered.  The more I saw of men,\nthe queerer they became.  Johnny Heinhold leaned across the bar and\nwhispered in my ear, \"He's got it in for you.  Watch out.\"\n\nI nodded comprehension of his statement, and acquiescence in it, as a man\nshould nod who knows all about men.  But secretly I was perplexed.\nHeavens! How was I, who had worked hard and read books of adventure, and\nwho was only fifteen years old, who had not dreamed of giving the Queen\nof the Oyster Pirates a second thought, and who did not know that French\nFrank was madly and Latinly in love with her--how was I to guess that I\nhad done him shame? And how was I to guess that the story of how the\nQueen had thrown him down on his own boat, the moment I hove in sight,\nwas already the gleeful gossip of the water-front? And by the same token,\nhow was I to guess that her brother Pat's offishness with me was anything\nelse than temperamental gloominess of spirit?\n\nWhisky Bob got me aside a moment.  \"Keep your eyes open,\" he muttered.\n\"Take my tip.  French Frank's ugly.  I'm going up river with him to get a\nschooner for oystering.  When he gets down on the beds, watch out.  He\nsays he'll run you down.  After dark, any time he's around, change your\nanchorage and douse your riding light.  Savve?\"\n\nOh, certainly, I savve'd.  I nodded my head, and, as one man to another,\nthanked him for his tip; and drifted back to the group at the bar.  No; I\ndid not treat.  I never dreamed that I was expected to treat.  I left\nwith Spider, and my ears burn now as I try to surmise the things they\nmust have said about me.\n\nI asked Spider, in an off-hand way, what was eating French Frank.  \"He's\ncrazy jealous of you,\" was the answer.  \"Do you think so?\" I said, and\ndismissed the matter as not worth thinking about.\n\nBut I leave it to any one--the swell of my fifteen-years-old manhood at\nlearning that French Frank, the adventurer of fifty, the sailor of all\nthe seas of all the world, was jealous of me--and jealous over a girl\nmost romantically named the Queen of the Oyster Pirates.  I had read of\nsuch things in books, and regarded them as personal probabilities of a\ndistant maturity.  Oh, I felt a rare young devil, as we hoisted the big\nmainsail that morning, broke out anchor, and filled away close-hauled on\nthe three-mile beat to windward out into the bay.\n\nSuch was my escape from the killing machine-toil, and my introduction to\nthe oyster pirates.  True, the introduction had begun with drink, and the\nlife promised to continue with drink.  But was I to stay away from it for\nsuch reason? Wherever life ran free and great, there men drank.  Romance\nand Adventure seemed always to go down the street locked arm in arm with\nJohn Barleycorn.  To know the two, I must know the third.  Or else I must\ngo back to my free library books and read of the deeds of other men and\ndo no deeds of my own save slave for ten cents an hour at a machine in a\ncannery.\n\nNo; I was not to be deterred from this brave life on the water by the\nfact that the water-dwellers had queer and expensive desires for beer and\nwine and whisky.  What if their notions of happiness included the strange\none of seeing me drink? When they persisted in buying the stuff and\nthrusting it upon me, why, I would drink it.  It was the price I would\npay for their comradeship.  And I didn't have to get drunk.  I had not\ngot drunk the Sunday afternoon I arranged to buy the Razzle Dazzle,\ndespite the fact that not one of the rest was sober.  Well, I could go on\ninto the future that way, drinking the stuff when it gave them pleasure\nthat I should drink it, but carefully avoiding over-drinking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nGradual as was my development as a heavy drinker among the oyster\npirates, the real heavy drinking came suddenly, and was the result, not\nof desire for alcohol, but of an intellectual conviction.\n\nThe more I saw of the life, the more I was enamoured of it.  I can never\nforget my thrills the first night I took part in a concerted raid, when\nwe assembled on board the Annie--rough men, big and unafraid, and\nweazened wharf-rats, some of them ex-convicts, all of them enemies of the\nlaw and meriting jail, in sea-boots and sea-gear, talking in gruff low\nvoices, and \"Big\" George with revolvers strapped about his waist to show\nthat he meant business.\n\nOh, I know, looking back, that the whole thing was sordid and silly.  But\nI was not looking back in those days when I was rubbing shoulders with\nJohn Barleycorn and beginning to accept him.  The life was brave and\nwild, and I was living the adventure I had read so much about.\n\nNelson, \"Young Scratch\" they called him, to distinguish him from \"Old\nScratch,\" his father, sailed in the sloop Reindeer, partners with one\n\"Clam.\"  Clam was a dare-devil, but Nelson was a reckless maniac.  He was\ntwenty years old, with the body of a Hercules.  When he was shot in\nBenicia, a couple of years later, the coroner said he was the\ngreatest-shouldered man he had ever seen laid on a slab.\n\nNelson could not read or write.  He had been \"dragged\" up by his father\non San Francisco Bay, and boats were second nature with him.  His\nstrength was prodigious, and his reputation along the water-front for\nviolence was anything but savoury.  He had Berserker rages and did mad,\nterrible things.  I made his acquaintance the first cruise of the Razzle\nDazzle, and saw him sail the Reindeer in a blow and dredge oysters all\naround the rest of us as we lay at two anchors, troubled with fear of\ngoing ashore.\n\nHe was some man, this Nelson; and when, passing by the Last Chance\nsaloon, he spoke to me, I felt very proud.  But try to imagine my pride\nwhen he promptly asked me in to have a drink.  I stood at the bar and\ndrank a glass of beer with him, and talked manfully of oysters, and\nboats, and of the mystery of who had put the load of buckshot through the\nAnnie's mainsail.\n\nWe talked and lingered at the bar.  It seemed to me strange that we\nlingered.  We had had our beer.  But who was I to lead the way outside\nwhen great Nelson chose to lean against the bar? After a few minutes, to\nmy surprise, he asked me to have another drink, which I did.  And still\nwe talked, and Nelson evinced no intention of leaving the bar.\n\nBear with me while I explain the way of my reasoning and of my innocence.\nFirst of all, I was very proud to be in the company of Nelson, who was\nthe most heroic figure among the oyster pirates and bay adventurers.\nUnfortunately for my stomach and mucous membranes, Nelson had a strange\nquirk of nature that made him find happiness in treating me to beer.  I\nhad no moral disinclination for beer, and just because I didn't like the\ntaste of it and the weight of it was no reason I should forgo the honour\nof his company.  It was his whim to drink beer, and to have me drink beer\nwith him.  Very well, I would put up with the passing discomfort.\n\nSo we continued to talk at the bar, and to drink beer ordered and paid\nfor by Nelson.  I think, now, when I look back upon it, that Nelson was\ncurious.  He wanted to find out just what kind of a gink I was.  He\nwanted to see how many times I'd let him treat without offering to treat\nin return.\n\nAfter I had drunk half a dozen glasses, my policy of temperateness in\nmind, I decided that I had had enough for that time.  So I mentioned that\nI was going aboard the Razzle Dazzle, then lying at the city wharf, a\nhundred yards away.\n\nI said good-bye to Nelson, and went on down the wharf.  But, John\nBarleycorn, to the extent of six glasses, went with me.  My brain tingled\nand was very much alive.  I was uplifted by my sense of manhood.  I, a\ntruly-true oyster pirate, was going aboard my own boat after hob-nobbing\nin the Last Chance with Nelson, the greatest oyster pirate of us all.\nStrong in my brain was the vision of us leaning against the bar and\ndrinking beer.  And curious it was, I decided, this whim of nature that\nmade men happy in spending good money for beer for a fellow like me who\ndidn't want it.\n\nAs I pondered this, I recollected that several times other men, in\ncouples, had entered the Last Chance, and first one, then the other, had\ntreated to drinks.  I remembered, on the drunk on the Idler, how Scotty\nand the harpooner and myself had raked and scraped dimes and nickels with\nwhich to buy the whisky.  Then came my boy code: when on a day a fellow\ngave another a \"cannon-ball\" or a chunk of taffy, on some other day he\nwould expect to receive back a cannon-ball or a chunk of taffy.\n\nThat was why Nelson had lingered at the bar.  Having bought a drink, he\nhad waited for me to buy one.  I HAD LET HIM BUY SIX DRINKS AND NEVER\nONCE OFFERED TO TREAT.  And he was the great Nelson! I could feel myself\nblushing with shame.  I sat down on the stringer-piece of the wharf and\nburied my face in my hands.  And the heat of my shame burned up my neck\nand into my cheeks and forehead.  I have blushed many times in my life,\nbut never have I experienced so terrible a blush as that one.\n\nAnd sitting there on the stringer-piece in my shame, I did a great deal\nof thinking and transvaluing of values.  I had been born poor.  Poor I\nhad lived.  I had gone hungry on occasion.  I had never had toys nor\nplaythings like other children.  My first memories of life were pinched\nby poverty.  The pinch of poverty had been chronic.  I was eight years\nold when I wore my first little undershirt actually sold in a store\nacross the counter.  And then it had been only one little undershirt.\nWhen it was soiled I had to return to the awful home-made things until it\nwas washed.  I had been so proud of it that I insisted on wearing it\nwithout any outer garment.  For the first time I mutinied against my\nmother--mutinied myself into hysteria, until she let me wear the store\nundershirt so all the world could see.\n\nOnly a man who has undergone famine can properly value food; only sailors\nand desert-dwellers know the meaning of fresh water.  And only a child,\nwith a child's imagination, can come to know the meaning of things it has\nbeen long denied.  I early discovered that the only things I could have\nwere those I got for myself.  My meagre childhood developed meagreness.\nThe first things I had been able to get for myself had been cigarette\npictures, cigarette posters, and cigarette albums.  I had not had the\nspending of the money I earned, so I traded \"extra\" newspapers for these\ntreasures.  I traded duplicates with the other boys, and circulating, as\nI did, all about town, I had greater opportunities for trading and\nacquiring.\n\nIt was not long before I had complete every series issued by every\ncigarette manufacturer--such as the Great Race Horses, Parisian Beauties,\nWomen of All Nations, Flags of All Nations, Noted Actors, Champion Prize\nFighters, etc.  And each series I had three different ways: in the card\nfrom the cigarette package, in the poster, and in the album.\n\nThen I began to accumulate duplicate sets, duplicate albums.  I traded\nfor other things that boys valued and which they usually bought with\nmoney given them by their parents.  Naturally, they did not have the keen\nsense of values that I had, who was never given money to buy anything.  I\ntraded for postage-stamps, for minerals, for curios, for birds' eggs, for\nmarbles (I had a more magnificent collection of agates than I have ever\nseen any boy possess--and the nucleus of the collection was a handful\nworth at least three dollars, which I had kept as security for twenty\ncents I loaned to a messenger-boy who was sent to reform school before he\ncould redeem them).\n\nI'd trade anything and everything for anything else, and turn it over in\na dozen more trades until it was transmuted into something that was worth\nsomething.  I was famous as a trader.  I was notorious as a miser.  I\ncould even make a junkman weep when I had dealings with him.  Other boys\ncalled me in to sell for them their collections of bottles, rags, old\niron, grain, and gunny-sacks, and five-gallon oil-cans--aye, and gave me\na commission for doing it.\n\nAnd this was the thrifty, close-fisted boy, accustomed to slave at a\nmachine for ten cents an hour, who sat on the stringer-piece and\nconsidered the matter of beer at five cents a glass and gone in a moment\nwith nothing to show for it.  I was now with men I admired.  I was proud\nto be with them.  Had all my pinching and saving brought me the\nequivalent of one of the many thrills which had been mine since I came\namong the oyster pirates? Then what was worth while--money or thrills?\nThese men had no horror of squandering a nickel, or many nickels.  They\nwere magnificently careless of money, calling up eight men to drink\nwhisky at ten cents a glass, as French Frank had done.  Why, Nelson had\njust spent sixty cents on beer for the two of us.\n\nWhich was it to be? I was aware that I was making a grave decision.  I\nwas deciding between money and men, between niggardliness and romance.\nEither I must throw overboard all my old values of money and look upon it\nas something to be flung about wastefully, or I must throw overboard my\ncomradeship with these men whose peculiar quirks made them like strong\ndrink.\n\nI retraced my steps up the wharf to the Last Chance, where Nelson still\nstood outside.  \"Come on and have a beer,\" I invited.  Again we stood at\nthe bar and drank and talked, but this time it was I who paid ten cents!\na whole hour of my labour at a machine for a drink of something I didn't\nwant and which tasted rotten.  But it wasn't difficult.  I had achieved a\nconcept.  Money no longer counted.  It was comradeship that counted.\n\"Have another?\" I said.  And we had another, and I paid for it.  Nelson,\nwith the wisdom of the skilled drinker, said to the barkeeper, \"Make mine\na small one, Johnny.\" Johnny nodded and gave him a glass that contained\nonly a third as much as the glasses we had been drinking.  Yet the charge\nwas the same--five cents.\n\nBy this time I was getting nicely jingled, so such extravagance didn't\nhurt me much.  Besides, I was learning.  There was more in this buying of\ndrinks than mere quantity.  I got my finger on it.  There was a stage\nwhen the beer didn't count at all, but just the spirit of comradeship of\ndrinking together.  And, ha!--another thing! I, too, could call for small\nbeers and minimise by two-thirds the detestable freightage with which\ncomradeship burdened one.\n\n\"I had to go aboard to get some money,\" I remarked casually, as we drank,\nin the hope Nelson would take it as an explanation of why I had let him\ntreat six consecutive times.\n\n\"Oh, well, you didn't have to do that,\" he answered.  \"Johnny'll trust a\nfellow like you--won't you, Johnny!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Johnny agreed, with a smile.\n\n\"How much you got down against me?\" Nelson queried.\n\nJohnny pulled out the book he kept behind the bar, found Nelson's page,\nand added up the account of several dollars.  At once I became possessed\nwith a desire to have a page in that book.  Almost it seemed the final\nbadge of manhood.\n\nAfter a couple more drinks, for which I insisted on paying, Nelson\ndecided to go.  We parted true comradely, and I wandered down the wharf\nto the Razzle Dazzle.  Spider was just building the fire for supper.\n\n\"Where'd you get it?\" he grinned up at me through the open companion.\n\n\"Oh, I've been with Nelson,\" I said carelessly, trying to hide my pride.\n\nThen an idea came to me.  Here was another one of them.  Now that I had\nachieved my concept, I might as well practise it thoroughly.  \"Come on,\"\nI said, \"up to Johnny's and have a drink.\"\n\nGoing up the wharf, we met Clam coming down.  Clam was Nelson's partner,\nand he was a fine, brave, handsome, moustached man of thirty--everything,\nin short, that his nickname did not connote.  \"Come on,\" I said, \"and\nhave a drink.\" He came.  As we turned into the Last Chance, there was\nPat, the Queen's brother, coming out.\n\n\"What's your hurry?\" I greeted him.  \"We're having a drink.  Come on\nalong.\" \"I've just had one,\" he demurred.  \"What of it?--we're having one\nnow,\" I retorted.  And Pat consented to join us, and I melted my way into\nhis good graces with a couple of glasses of beer.  Oh! I was learning\nthings that afternoon about John Barleycorn.  There was more in him than\nthe bad taste when you swallowed him.  Here, at the absurd cost of ten\ncents, a gloomy, grouchy individual, who threatened to become an enemy,\nwas made into a good friend.  He became even genial, his looks were\nkindly, and our voices mellowed together as we talked water-front and\noyster-bed gossip.\n\n\"Small beer for me, Johnny,\" I said, when the others had ordered\nschooners.  Yes, and I said it like the accustomed drinker, carelessly,\ncasually, as a sort of spontaneous thought that had just occurred to me.\nLooking back, I am confident that the only one there who guessed I was a\ntyro at bar-drinking was Johnny Heinhold.\n\n\"Where'd he get it?\" I overheard Spider confidentially ask Johnny.\n\n\"Oh, he's been sousin' here with Nelson all afternoon,\" was Johnny's\nanswer.\n\nI never let on that I'd heard, but PROUD? Aye, even the barkeeper was\ngiving me a recommendation as a man.  \"HE'S BEEN SOUSIN' HERE WITH NELSON\nALL AFTERNOON.\" Magic words! The accolade delivered by a barkeeper with a\nbeer glass!\n\nI remembered that French Frank had treated Johnny the day I bought the\nRazzle Dazzle.  The glasses were filled and we were ready to drink.\n\"Have something yourself, Johnny,\" I said, with an air of having intended\nto say it all the time, but of having been a trifle remiss because of the\ninteresting conversation I had been holding with Clam and Pat.\n\nJohnny looked at me with quick sharpness, divining, I am positive, the\nstrides I was making in my education, and poured himself whisky from his\nprivate bottle.  This hit me for a moment on my thrifty side.  He had\ntaken a ten-cent drink when the rest of us were drinking five-cent\ndrinks! But the hurt was only for a moment.  I dismissed it as ignoble,\nremembered my concept, and did not give myself away.\n\n\"You'd better put me down in the book for this,\" I said, when we had\nfinished the drink.  And I had the satisfaction of seeing a fresh page\ndevoted to my name and a charge pencilled for a round of drinks amounting\nto thirty cents.  And I glimpsed, as through a golden haze, a future\nwherein that page would be much charged, and crossed off, and charged\nagain.\n\nI treated a second time around, and then, to my amazement, Johnny\nredeemed himself in that matter of the ten-cent drink.  He treated us\naround from behind the bar, and I decided that he had arithmetically\nevened things up handsomely.\n\n\"Let's go around to the St. Louis House,\" Spider suggested when we got\noutside.  Pat, who had been shovelling coal all day, had gone home, and\nClam had gone upon the Reindeer to cook supper.\n\nSo around Spider and I went to the St. Louis House--my first visit--a\nhuge bar-room, where perhaps fifty men, mostly longshoremen, were\ncongregated.  And there I met Soup Kennedy for the second time, and Bill\nKelley.  And Smith, of the Annie, drifted in--he of the belt-buckled\nrevolvers.  And Nelson showed up.  And I met others, including the Vigy\nbrothers, who ran the place, and, chiefest of all, Joe Goose, with the\nwicked eyes, the twisted nose, and the flowered vest, who played the\nharmonica like a roystering angel and went on the most atrocious tears\nthat even the Oakland water-front could conceive of and admire.\n\nAs I bought drinks--others treated as well--the thought flickered across\nmy mind that Mammy Jennie wasn't going to be repaid much on her loan out\nof that week's earnings of the Razzle Dazzle.  \"But what of it?\" I\nthought, or rather, John Barleycorn thought it for me.  \"You're a man and\nyou're getting acquainted with men.  Mammy Jennie doesn't need the money\nas promptly as all that.  She isn't starving.  You know that.  She's got\nother money in the bank.  Let her wait, and pay her back gradually.\"\n\nAnd thus it was I learned another trait of John Barleycorn.  He inhibits\nmorality.  Wrong conduct that it is impossible for one to do sober, is\ndone quite easily when one is not sober.  In fact, it is the only thing\none can do, for John Barleycorn's inhibition rises like a wall between\none's immediate desires and long-learned morality.\n\nI dismissed my thought of debt to Mammy Jennie and proceeded to get\nacquainted at the trifling expense of some trifling money and a jingle\nthat was growing unpleasant.  Who took me on board and put me to bed that\nnight I do not know, but I imagine it must have been Spider.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nAnd so I won my manhood's spurs.  My status on the water-front and with\nthe oyster pirates became immediately excellent.  I was looked upon as a\ngood fellow, as well as no coward.  And somehow, from the day I achieved\nthat concept sitting on the stringer-piece of the Oakland City Wharf, I\nhave never cared much for money.  No one has ever considered me a miser\nsince, while my carelessness of money is a source of anxiety and worry to\nsome that know me.\n\nSo completely did I break with my parsimonious past that I sent word home\nto my mother to call in the boys of the neighbourhood and give to them\nall my collections.  I never even cared to learn what boys got what\ncollections.  I was a man now, and I made a clean sweep of everything\nthat bound me to my boyhood.\n\nMy reputation grew.  When the story went around the water-front of how\nFrench Frank had tried to run me down with his schooner, and of how I had\nstood on the deck of the Razzle Dazzle, a cocked double-barrelled shotgun\nin my hands, steering with my feet and holding her to her course, and\ncompelled him to put up his wheel and keep away, the water-front decided\nthat there was something in me despite my youth.  And I continued to show\nwhat was in me.  There were the times I brought the Razzle Dazzle in with\na bigger load of oysters than any other two-man craft; there was the time\nwhen we raided far down in Lower Bay, and mine was the only craft back at\ndaylight to the anchorage off Asparagus Island; there was the Thursday\nnight we raced for market and I brought the Razzle Dazzle in without a\nrudder, first of the fleet, and skimmed the cream of the Friday morning\ntrade; and there was the time I brought her in from Upper Bay under a\njib, when Scotty burned my mainsail.  (Yes; it was Scotty of the Idler\nadventure.  Irish had followed Spider on board the Razzle Dazzle, and\nScotty, turning up, had taken Irish's place.)\n\nBut the things I did on the water only partly counted.  What completed\neverything, and won for me the title of \"Prince of the Oyster Beds,\" was\nthat I was a good fellow ashore with my money, buying drinks like a man.\nI little dreamed that the time would come when the Oakland water-front,\nwhich had shocked me at first would be shocked and annoyed by the devilry\nof the things I did.\n\nBut always the life was tied up with drinking.  The saloons are poor\nmen's clubs.  Saloons are congregating places.  We engaged to meet one\nanother in saloons.  We celebrated our good fortune or wept our grief in\nsaloons.  We got acquainted in saloons.\n\nCan I ever forget the afternoon I met \"Old Scratch,\" Nelson's father?  It\nwas in the Last Chance.  Johnny Heinhold introduced us.  That Old Scratch\nwas Nelson's father was noteworthy enough.  But there was more in it than\nthat.  He was owner and master of the scow-schooner Annie Mine, and some\nday I might ship as a sailor with him.  Still more, he was romance.  He\nwas a blue-eyed, yellow-haired, raw-boned Viking, big-bodied and\nstrong-muscled despite his age.  And he had sailed the seas in ships of\nall nations in the old savage sailing days.\n\nI had heard many weird tales about him, and worshipped him from a\ndistance.  It took the saloon to bring us together.  Even so, our\nacquaintance might have been no more than a hand-grip and a word--he was\na laconic old fellow--had it not been for the drinking.\n\n\"Have a drink,\" I said, with promptitude, after the pause which I had\nlearned good form in drinking dictates.  Of course, while we drank our\nbeer, which I had paid for, it was incumbent on him to listen to me and\nto talk to me.  And Johnny, like a true host, made the tactful remarks\nthat enabled us to find mutual topics of conversation.  And of course,\nhaving drunk my beer, Captain Nelson must now buy beer in turn.  This led\nto more talking, and Johnny drifted out of the conversation to wait on\nother customers.\n\nThe more beer Captain Nelson and I drank, the better we got acquainted.\nIn me he found an appreciative listener, who, by virtue of book-reading,\nknew much about the sea-life he had lived.  So he drifted back to his\nwild young days, and spun many a rare yarn for me, while we downed beer,\ntreat by treat, all through a blessed summer afternoon.  And it was only\nJohn Barleycorn that made possible that long afternoon with the old\nsea-dog.\n\nIt was Johnny Heinhold who secretly warned me across the bar that I was\ngetting pickled and advised me to take small beers.  But as long as\nCaptain Nelson drank large beers, my pride forbade anything else than\nlarge beers.  And not until the skipper ordered his first small beer did\nI order one for myself.  Oh, when we came to a lingering fond farewell, I\nwas drunk.  But I had the satisfaction of seeing Old Scratch as drunk as\nI.  My youthful modesty scarcely let me dare believe that the hardened\nold buccaneer was even more drunk.\n\nAnd afterwards, from Spider, and Pat, and Clam, and Johnny Heinhold, and\nothers, came the tips that Old Scratch liked me and had nothing but good\nwords for the fine lad I was.  Which was the more remarkable, because he\nwas known as a savage, cantankerous old cuss who never liked anybody.\n(His very nickname, \"Scratch,\" arose from a Berserker trick of his, in\nfighting, of tearing off his opponent's face.)  And that I had won his\nfriendship, all thanks were due to John Barleycorn.  I have given the\nincident merely as an example of the multitudinous lures and draws and\nservices by which John Barleycorn wins his followers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nAnd still there arose in me no desire for alcohol, no chemical demand.\nIn years and years of heavy drinking, drinking did not beget the desire.\nDrinking was the way of the life I led, the way of the men with whom I\nlived.  While away on my cruises on the bay, I took no drink along; and\nwhile out on the bay the thought of the desirableness of a drink never\ncrossed my mind.  It was not until I tied the Razzle Dazzle up to the\nwharf and got ashore in the congregating places of men, where drink\nflowed, that the buying of drinks for other men, and the accepting of\ndrinks from other men, devolved upon me as a social duty and a manhood\nrite.\n\nThen, too, there were the times, lying at the city wharf or across the\nestuary on the sand-spit, when the Queen, and her sister, and her brother\nPat, and Mrs. Hadley came aboard.  It was my boat, I was host, and I\ncould only dispense hospitality in the terms of their understanding of\nit.  So I would rush Spider, or Irish, or Scotty, or whoever was my crew,\nwith the can for beer and the demijohn for red wine.  And again, lying at\nthe wharf disposing of my oysters, there were dusky twilights when big\npolicemen and plain-clothes men stole on board.  And because we lived in\nthe shadow of the police, we opened oysters and fed them to them with\nsquirts of pepper sauce, and rushed the growler or got stronger stuff in\nbottles.\n\nDrink as I would, I couldn't come to like John Barleycorn.  I valued him\nextremely well for his associations, but not for the taste of him.  All\nthe time I was striving to be a man amongst men, and all the time I\nnursed secret and shameful desires for candy.  But I would have died\nbefore I'd let anybody guess it.  I used to indulge in lonely debauches,\non nights when I knew my crew was going to sleep ashore.  I would go up\nto the Free Library, exchange my books, buy a quarter's worth of all\nsorts of candy that chewed and lasted, sneak aboard the Razzle Dazzle,\nlock myself in the cabin, go to bed, and lie there long hours of bliss,\nreading and chewing candy.  And those were the only times I felt that I\ngot my real money's worth.  Dollars and dollars, across the bar, couldn't\nbuy the satisfaction that twenty-five cents did in a candy store.\n\nAs my drinking grew heavier, I began to note more and more that it was in\nthe drinking bouts the purple passages occurred.  Drunks were always\nmemorable.  At such times things happened.  Men like Joe Goose dated\nexistence from drunk to drunk.  The longshoremen all looked forward to\ntheir Saturday night drunk.  We of the oyster boats waited until we had\ndisposed of our cargoes before we got really started, though a scattering\nof drinks and a meeting of a chance friend sometimes precipitated an\naccidental drunk.\n\nIn ways, the accidental drunks were the best.  Stranger and more exciting\nthings happened at such times.  As, for instance, the Sunday when Nelson\nand French Frank and Captain Spink stole the stolen salmon boat from\nWhisky Bob and Nicky the Greek.  Changes had taken place in the personnel\nof the oyster boats.  Nelson had got into a fight with Bill Kelley on the\nAnnie and was carrying a bullet-hole through his left hand.  Also, having\nquarrelled with Clam and broken partnership, Nelson had sailed the\nReindeer, his arm in a sling, with a crew of two deep-water sailors, and\nhe had sailed so madly as to frighten them ashore.  Such was the tale of\nhis recklessness they spread, that no one on the water-front would go out\nwith Nelson.  So the Reindeer, crewless, lay across the estuary at the\nsandspit.  Beside her lay the Razzle Dazzle with a burned mainsail and\nScotty and me on board.  Whisky Bob had fallen out with French Frank and\ngone on a raid \"up river\" with Nicky the Greek.\n\nThe result of this raid was a brand-new Columbia River salmon boat,\nstolen from an Italian fisherman.  We oyster pirates were all visited by\nthe searching Italian, and we were convinced, from what we knew of their\nmovements, that Whisky Bob and Nicky the Greek were the guilty parties.\nBut where was the salmon boat?  Hundreds of Greek and Italian fishermen,\nup river and down bay, had searched every slough and tule patch for it.\nWhen the owner despairingly offered a reward of fifty dollars, our\ninterest increased and the mystery deepened.\n\nOne Sunday morning old Captain Spink paid me a visit.  The conversation\nwas confidential.  He had just been fishing in his skiff in the old\nAlameda ferry slip.  As the tide went down, he had noticed a rope tied to\na pile under water and leading downward.  In vain he had tried to heave\nup what was fast on the other end.  Farther along, to another pile, was a\nsimilar rope, leading downward and unheavable.  Without doubt, it was the\nmissing salmon boat.  If we restored it to its rightful owner there was\nfifty dollars in it for us.  But I had queer ethical notions about honour\namongst thieves, and declined to have anything to do with the affair.\n\nBut French Frank had quarrelled with Whisky Bob, and Nelson was also an\nenemy.  (Poor Whisky Bob!--without viciousness, good-natured, generous,\nborn weak, raised poorly, with an irresistible chemical demand for\nalcohol, still prosecuting his vocation of bay pirate, his body was\npicked up, not long afterward, beside a dock where it had sunk full of\ngunshot wounds.)  Within an hour after I had rejected Captain Spink's\nproposal, I saw him sail down the estuary on board the Reindeer with\nNelson.  Also, French Frank went by on his schooner.\n\nIt was not long ere they sailed back up the estuary, curiously side by\nside.  As they headed in for the sandspit, the submerged salmon boat\ncould be seen, gunwales awash and held up from sinking by ropes fast to\nthe schooner and the sloop.  The tide was half out, and they sailed\nsquarely in on the sand, grounding in a row, with the salmon boat in the\nmiddle.\n\nImmediately Hans, one of French Frank's sailors, was into a skiff and\npulling rapidly for the north shore.  The big demijohn in the\nstern-sheets told his errand.  They couldn't wait a moment to celebrate\nthe fifty dollars they had so easily earned.  It is the way of the\ndevotees of John Barleycorn.  When good fortune comes, they drink.  When\nthey have no fortune, they drink to the hope of good fortune.  If fortune\nbe ill, they drink to forget it.  If they meet a friend, they drink.  If\nthey quarrel with a friend and lose him, they drink.  If their\nlove-making be crowned with success, they are so happy they needs must\ndrink.  If they be jilted, they drink for the contrary reason.  And if\nthey haven't anything to do at all, why, they take a drink, secure in the\nknowledge that when they have taken a sufficient number of drinks the\nmaggots will start crawling in their brains and they will have their\nhands full with things to do.  When they are sober they want to drink;\nand when they have drunk they want to drink more.\n\nOf course, as fellow comrades, Scotty and I were called in for the\ndrinking.  We helped to make a hole in that fifty dollars not yet\nreceived.  The afternoon, from just an ordinary common summer Sunday\nafternoon, became a gorgeous, purple afternoon.  We all talked and sang\nand ranted and bragged, and ever French Frank and Nelson sent more drinks\naround.  We lay in full sight of the Oakland water-front, and the noise\nof our revels attracted friends.  Skiff after skiff crossed the estuary\nand hauled up on the sandspit, while Hans' work was cut out for him--ever\nto row back and forth for more supplies of booze.\n\nThen Whisky Bob and Nicky the Greek arrived, sober, indignant, outraged\nin that their fellow pirates had raised their plant.  French Frank, aided\nby John Barleycorn, orated hypocritically about virtue and honesty, and,\ndespite his fifty years, got Whisky Bob out on the sand and proceeded to\nlick him.  When Nicky the Greek jumped in with a short-handled shovel to\nWhisky Bob's assistance, short work was made of him by Hans.  And of\ncourse, when the bleeding remnants of Bob and Nicky were sent packing in\ntheir skiff, the event must needs be celebrated in further carousal.\n\nBy this time, our visitors being numerous, we were a large crowd\ncompounded of many nationalities and diverse temperaments, all aroused by\nJohn Barleycorn, all restraints cast off.  Old quarrels revived, ancient\nhates flared up.  Fight was in the air.  And whenever a longshoreman\nremembered something against a scow-schooner sailor, or vice versa, or an\noyster pirate remembered or was remembered, a fist shot out and another\nfight was on.  And every fight was made up in more rounds of drinks,\nwherein the combatants, aided and abetted by the rest of us, embraced\neach other and pledged undying friendship.\n\nAnd, of all times, Soup Kennedy selected this time to come and retrieve\nan old shirt of his, left aboard the Reindeer from the trip he sailed\nwith Clam.  He had espoused Clam's side of the quarrel with Nelson.\nAlso, he had been drinking in the St. Louis House, so that it was John\nBarleycorn who led him to the sandspit in quest of his old shirt.  Few\nwords started the fray.  He locked with Nelson in the cockpit of the\nReindeer, and in the mix-up barely escaped being brained by an iron bar\nwielded by irate French Frank--irate because a two-handed man had\nattacked a one-handed man.  (If the Reindeer still floats, the dent of\nthe iron bar remains in the hard-wood rail of her cockpit.)\n\nBut Nelson pulled his bandaged hand, bullet-perforated, out of its sling,\nand, held by us, wept and roared his Berserker belief that he could lick\nSoup Kennedy one-handed.  And we let them loose on the sand.  Once, when\nit looked as if Nelson were getting the worst of it, French Frank and\nJohn Barleycorn sprang unfairly into the fight.  Scotty protested and\nreached for French Frank, who whirled upon him and fell on top of him in\na pummelling clinch after a sprawl of twenty feet across the sand.  In\nthe course of separating these two, half a dozen fights started amongst\nthe rest of us.  These fights were finished, one way or the other, or we\nseparated them with drinks, while all the time Nelson and Soup Kennedy\nfought on.  Occasionally we returned to them and gave advice, such as,\nwhen they lay exhausted in the sand, unable to strike a blow, \"Throw sand\nin his eyes.\" And they threw sand in each other's eyes, recuperated, and\nfought on to successive exhaustions.\n\nAnd now, of all this that is squalid, and ridiculous, and bestial, try to\nthink what it meant to me, a youth not yet sixteen, burning with the\nspirit of adventure, fancy-filled with tales of buccaneers and\nsea-rovers, sacks of cities and conflicts of armed men, and\nimagination-maddened by the stuff I had drunk.  It was life raw and\nnaked, wild and free--the only life of that sort which my birth in time\nand space permitted me to attain.  And more than that.  It carried a\npromise.  It was the beginning.  From the sandspit the way led out\nthrough the Golden Gate to the vastness of adventure of all the world,\nwhere battles would be fought, not for old shirts and over stolen salmon\nboats, but for high purposes and romantic ends.\n\nAnd because I told Scotty what I thought of his letting an old man like\nFrench Frank get away with him, we, too, brawled and added to the\nfestivity of the sandspit.  And Scotty threw up his job as crew, and\ndeparted in the night with a pair of blankets belonging to me.  During\nthe night, while the oyster pirates lay stupefied in their bunks, the\nschooner and the Reindeer floated on the high water and swung about to\ntheir anchors.  The salmon boat, still filled with rocks and water,\nrested on the bottom.\n\nIn the morning, early, I heard wild cries from the Reindeer, and tumbled\nout in the chill grey to see a spectacle that made the water-front laugh\nfor days.  The beautiful salmon boat lay on the hard sand, squashed flat\nas a pancake, while on it were perched French Frank's schooner and the\nReindeer.  Unfortunately two of the Reindeer's planks had been crushed in\nby the stout oak stem of the salmon boat.  The rising tide had flowed\nthrough the hole, and just awakened Nelson by getting into his bunk with\nhim.  I lent a hand, and we pumped the Reindeer out and repaired the\ndamage.\n\nThen Nelson cooked breakfast, and while we ate we considered the\nsituation.  He was broke.  So was I.  The fifty dollars reward would\nnever be paid for that pitiful mess of splinters on the sand beneath us.\nHe had a wounded hand and no crew.  I had a burned main sail and no crew.\n\n\"What d'ye say, you and me?\" Nelson queried.  \"I'll go you,\" was my\nanswer.  And thus I became partners with \"Young Scratch\" Nelson, the\nwildest, maddest of them all.  We borrowed the money for an outfit of\ngrub from Johnny Heinhold, filled our water-barrels, and sailed away that\nday for the oyster-beds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nNor have I ever regretted those months of mad devilry I put in with\nNelson.  He COULD sail, even if he did frighten every man that sailed\nwith him.  To steer to miss destruction by an inch or an instant was his\njoy.  To do what everybody else did not dare attempt to do, was his\npride.  Never to reef down was his mania, and in all the time I spent\nwith him, blow high or low, the Reindeer was never reefed.  Nor was she\never dry.  We strained her open and sailed her open and sailed her open\ncontinually.  And we abandoned the Oakland water-front and went wider\nafield for our adventures.\n\nAnd all this glorious passage in my life was made possible for me by John\nBarleycorn.  And this is my complaint against John Barleycorn.  Here I\nwas, thirsting for the wild life of adventure, and the only way for me to\nwin to it was through John Barleycorn's mediation.  It was the way of the\nmen who lived the life.  Did I wish to live the life, I must live it the\nway they did.  It was by virtue of drinking that I gained that\npartnership and comradeship with Nelson.  Had I drunk only the beer he\npaid for, or had I declined to drink at all, I should never have been\nselected by him as a partner.  He wanted a partner who would meet him on\nthe social side, as well as the work side of life.\n\nI abandoned myself to the life, and developed the misconception that the\nsecret of John Barleycorn lay in going on mad drunks, rising through the\nsuccessive stages that only an iron constitution could endure to final\nstupefaction and swinish unconsciousness.  I did not like the taste, so I\ndrank for the sole purpose of getting drunk, of getting hopelessly,\nhelplessly drunk.  And I, who had saved and scraped, traded like a\nShylock and made junkmen weep; I, who had stood aghast when French Frank,\nat a single stroke, spent eighty cents for whisky for eight men, I turned\nmyself loose with a more lavish disregard for money than any of them.\n\nI remember going ashore one night with Nelson.  In my pocket were one\nhundred and eighty dollars.  It was my intention, first, to buy me some\nclothes, after that, some drinks.  I needed the clothes.  All I possessed\nwere on me, and they were as follows: a pair of sea-boots that\nprovidentially leaked the water out as fast as it ran in, a pair of\nfifty-cent overalls, a forty-cent cotton shirt, and a sou'wester.  I had\nno hat, so I had to wear the sou'wester, and it will be noted that I have\nlisted neither underclothes nor socks.  I didn't own any.\n\nTo reach the stores where clothes could be bought, we had to pass a dozen\nsaloons.  So I bought me the drinks first.  I never got to the clothing\nstores.  In the morning, broke, poisoned, but contented, I came back on\nboard, and we set sail.  I possessed only the clothes I had gone ashore\nin, and not a cent remained of the one hundred and eighty dollars.  It\nmight well be deemed impossible, by those who have never tried it, that\nin twelve hours a lad can spend all of one hundred and eighty dollars for\ndrinks.  I know otherwise.\n\nAnd I had no regrets.  I was proud.  I had shown them I could spend with\nthe best of them.  Amongst strong men I had proved myself strong.  I had\nclinched again, as I had often clinched, my right to the title of\n\"Prince.\" Also, my attitude may be considered, in part, as a reaction\nfrom my childhood's meagreness and my childhood's excessive toil.\nPossibly my inchoate thought was: Better to reign among booze-fighters a\nprince than to toil twelve hours a day at a machine for ten cents an\nhour.  There are no purple passages in machine toil.  But if the spending\nof one hundred and eighty dollars in twelve hours isn't a purple passage,\nthen I'd like to know what is.\n\nOh, I skip much of the details of my trafficking with John Barleycorn\nduring this period, and shall only mention events that will throw light\non John Barleycorn's ways.  There were three things that enabled me to\npursue this heavy drinking: first, a magnificent constitution far better\nthan the average; second, the healthy open-air life on the water; and\nthird, the fact that I drank irregularly.  While out on the water, we\nnever carried any drink along.\n\nThe world was opening up to me.  Already I knew several hundred miles of\nthe water-ways of it, and of the towns and cities and fishing hamlets on\nthe shores.  Came the whisper to range farther.  I had not found it yet.\nThere was more behind.  But even this much of the world was too wide for\nNelson.  He wearied for his beloved Oakland water-front, and when he\nelected to return to it we separated in all friendliness.\n\nI now made the old town of Benicia, on the Carquinez Straits, my\nheadquarters.  In a cluster of fishermen's arks, moored in the tules on\nthe water-front, dwelt a congenial crowd of drinkers and vagabonds, and I\njoined them.  I had longer spells ashore, between fooling with salmon\nfishing and making raids up and down bay and rivers as a deputy fish\npatrolman, and I drank more and learned more about drinking.  I held my\nown with any one, drink for drink; and often drank more than my share to\nshow the strength of my manhood.  When, on a morning, my unconscious\ncarcass was disentangled from the nets on the drying-frames, whither I\nhad stupidly, blindly crawled the night before; and when the water-front\ntalked it over with many a giggle and laugh and another drink, I was\nproud indeed.  It was an exploit.\n\nAnd when I never drew a sober breath, on one stretch, for three solid\nweeks, I was certain I had reached the top.  Surely, in that direction,\none could go no farther.  It was time for me to move on.  For always,\ndrunk or sober, at the back of my consciousness something whispered that\nthis carousing and bay-adventuring was not all of life.  This whisper was\nmy good fortune.  I happened to be so made that I could hear it calling,\nalways calling, out and away over the world.  It was not canniness on my\npart.  It was curiosity, desire to know, an unrest and a seeking for\nthings wonderful that I seemed somehow to have glimpsed or guessed.  What\nwas this life for, I demanded, if this were all? No; there was something\nmore, away and beyond.  (And, in relation to my much later development as\na drinker, this whisper, this promise of the things at the back of life,\nmust be noted, for it was destined to play a dire part in my more recent\nwrestlings with John Barleycorn.)\n\nBut what gave immediacy to my decision to move on was a trick John\nBarleycorn played me--a monstrous, incredible trick that showed abysses\nof intoxication hitherto undreamed.  At one o'clock in the morning, after\na prodigious drunk, I was tottering aboard a sloop at the end of the\nwharf, intending to go to sleep.  The tides sweep through Carquinez\nStraits as in a mill-race, and the full ebb was on when I stumbled\noverboard.  There was nobody on the wharf, nobody on the sloop.  I was\nborne away by the current.  I was not startled.  I thought the\nmisadventure delightful.  I was a good swimmer, and in my inflamed\ncondition the contact of the water with my skin soothed me like cool\nlinen.\n\nAnd then John Barleycorn played me his maniacal trick.  Some maundering\nfancy of going out with the tide suddenly obsessed me.  I had never been\nmorbid.  Thoughts of suicide had never entered my head.  And now that\nthey entered, I thought it fine, a splendid culminating, a perfect\nrounding off of my short but exciting career.  I, who had never known\ngirl's love, nor woman's love, nor the love of children; who had never\nplayed in the wide joy-fields of art, nor climbed the star-cool heights\nof philosophy, nor seen with my eyes more than a pin-point's surface of\nthe gorgeous world; I decided that this was all, that I had seen all,\nlived all, been all, that was worth while, and that now was the time to\ncease.  This was the trick of John Barleycorn, laying me by the heels of\nmy imagination and in a drug-dream dragging me to death.\n\nOh, he was convincing.  I had really experienced all of life, and it\ndidn't amount to much.  The swinish drunkenness in which I had lived for\nmonths (this was accompanied by the sense of degradation and the old\nfeeling of conviction of sin) was the last and best, and I could see for\nmyself what it was worth.  There were all the broken-down old bums and\nloafers I had bought drinks for.  That was what remained of life.  Did I\nwant to become like them? A thousand times no; and I wept tears of sweet\nsadness over my glorious youth going out with the tide.  (And who has not\nseen the weeping drunk, the melancholic drunk? They are to be found in\nall the bar-rooms, if they can find no other listener telling their\nsorrows to the barkeeper, who is paid to listen.)\n\nThe water was delicious.  It was a man's way to die.  John Barleycorn\nchanged the tune he played in my drink-maddened brain.  Away with tears\nand regret.  It was a hero's death, and by the hero's own hand and will.\nSo I struck up my death-chant and was singing it lustily, when the gurgle\nand splash of the current-riffles in my ears reminded me of my more\nimmediate situation.\n\nBelow the town of Benicia, where the Solano wharf projects, the Straits\nwiden out into what bay-farers call the \"Bight of Turner's Shipyard.\" I\nwas in the shore-tide that swept under the Solano wharf and on into the\nbight.  I knew of old the power of the suck which developed when the tide\nswung around the end of Dead Man's Island and drove straight for the\nwharf.  I didn't want to go through those piles.  It wouldn't be nice,\nand I might lose an hour in the bight on my way out with the tide.\n\nI undressed in the water and struck out with a strong, single-overhand\nstroke, crossing the current at right-angles.  Nor did I cease until, by\nthe wharf lights, I knew I was safe to sweep by the end.  Then I turned\nover and rested.  The stroke had been a telling one, and I was a little\ntime in recovering my breath.\n\nI was elated, for I had succeeded in avoiding the suck.  I started to\nraise my death-chant again--a purely extemporised farrago of a\ndrug-crazed youth.  \"Don't sing--yet,\" whispered John Barleycorn.  \"The\nSolano runs all night.  There are railroad men on the wharf.  They will\nhear you, and come out in a boat and rescue you, and you don't want to be\nrescued.\" I certainly didn't.  What? Be robbed of my hero's death?\nNever.  And I lay on my back in the starlight, watching the familiar\nwharf-lights go by, red and green and white, and bidding sad sentimental\nfarewell to them, each and all.\n\nWhen I was well clear, in mid-channel, I sang again.  Sometimes I swam a\nfew strokes, but in the main I contented myself with floating and\ndreaming long drunken dreams.  Before daylight, the chill of the water\nand the passage of the hours had sobered me sufficiently to make me\nwonder what portion of the Straits I was in, and also to wonder if the\nturn of the tide wouldn't catch me and take me back ere I had drifted out\ninto San Pablo Bay.\n\nNext I discovered that I was very weary and very cold, and quite sober,\nand that I didn't in the least want to be drowned.  I could make out the\nSelby Smelter on the Contra Costa shore and the Mare Island lighthouse.\nI started to swim for the Solano shore, but was too weak and chilled, and\nmade so little headway, and at the cost of such painful effort, that I\ngave it up and contented myself with floating, now and then giving a\nstroke to keep my balance in the tide-rips which were increasing their\ncommotion on the surface of the water.  And I knew fear.  I was sober\nnow, and I didn't want to die.  I discovered scores of reasons for\nliving.  And the more reasons I discovered, the more liable it seemed\nthat I was going to drown anyway.\n\nDaylight, after I had been four hours in the water, found me in a parlous\ncondition in the tide-rips off Mare Island light, where the swift ebbs\nfrom Vallejo Straits and Carquinez Straits were fighting with each other,\nand where, at that particular moment, they were fighting the flood tide\nsetting up against them from San Pablo Bay.  A stiff breeze had sprung\nup, and the crisp little waves were persistently lapping into my mouth,\nand I was beginning to swallow salt water.  With my swimmer's knowledge,\nI knew the end was near.  And then the boat came--a Greek fisherman\nrunning in for Vallejo; and again I had been saved from John Barleycorn\nby my constitution and physical vigour.\n\nAnd, in passing, let me note that this maniacal trick John Barleycorn\nplayed me is nothing uncommon.  An absolute statistic of the percentage\nof suicides due to John Barleycorn would be appalling.  In my case,\nhealthy, normal, young, full of the joy of life, the suggestion to kill\nmyself was unusual; but it must be taken into account that it came on the\nheels of a long carouse, when my nerves and brain were fearfully\npoisoned, and that the dramatic, romantic side of my imagination,\ndrink-maddened to lunacy, was delighted with the suggestion.  And yet,\nthe older, more morbid drinkers, more jaded with life and more\ndisillusioned, who kill themselves, do so usually after a long debauch,\nwhen their nerves and brains are thoroughly poison-soaked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nSo I left Benicia, where John Barleycorn had nearly got me, and ranged\nwider afield in pursuit of the whisper from the back of life to come and\nfind.  And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads.\nMen still congregated in saloons.  They were the poor-man's clubs, and\nthey were the only clubs to which I had access.  I could get acquainted\nin saloons.  I could go into a saloon and talk with any man.  In the\nstrange towns and cities I wandered through, the only place for me to go\nwas the saloon.  I was no longer a stranger in any town the moment I had\nentered a saloon.\n\nAnd right here let me break in with experiences no later than last year.\nI harnessed four horses to a light trap, took Charmian along, and drove\nfor three months and a half over the wildest mountain parts of California\nand Oregon.  Each morning I did my regular day's work of writing fiction.\nThat completed, I drove on through the middle of the day and the\nafternoon to the next stop.  But the irregularity of occurrence of\nstopping-places, coupled with widely varying road conditions, made it\nnecessary to plan, the day before, each day's drive and my work.  I must\nknow when I was to start driving in order to start writing in time to\nfinish my day's output.  Thus, on occasion, when the drive was to be\nlong, I would be up and at my writing by five in the morning.  On easier\ndriving days I might not start writing till nine o'clock.\n\nBut how to plan? As soon as I arrived in a town, and put the horses up,\non the way from the stable to the hotel I dropped into the saloons.\nFirst thing, a drink--oh, I wanted the drink, but also it must not be\nforgotten that, because of wanting to know things, it was in this very\nway I had learned to want a drink.  Well, the first thing, a drink.\n\"Have something yourself,\" to the barkeeper.  And then, as we drink, my\nopening query about roads and stopping-places on ahead.\n\n\"Let me see,\" the barkeeper will say, \"there's the road across Tarwater\nDivide.  That used to be good.  I was over it three years ago.  But it\nwas blocked this spring.  Say, I'll tell you what.  I'll ask Jerry----\"\nAnd the barkeeper turns and addresses some man sitting at a table or\nleaning against the bar farther along, and who may be Jerry, or Tom, or\nBill.  \"Say, Jerry, how about the Tarwater road? You was down to Wilkins\nlast week.\"\n\nAnd while Bill or Jerry or Tom is beginning to unlimber his thinking and\nspeaking apparatus, I suggest that he join us in the drink.  Then\ndiscussions arise about the advisability of this road or that, what the\nbest stopping-places may be, what running time I may expect to make,\nwhere the best trout streams are, and so forth, in which other men join,\nand which are punctuated with more drinks.\n\nTwo or three more saloons, and I accumulate a warm jingle and come pretty\nclose to knowing everybody in town, all about the town, and a fair deal\nabout the surrounding country.  I know the lawyers, editors, business\nmen, local politicians, and the visiting ranchers, hunters, and miners,\nso that by evening, when Charmian and I stroll down the main street and\nback, she is astounded by the number of my acquaintances in that totally\nstrange town.\n\nAnd thus is demonstrated a service John Barleycorn renders, a service by\nwhich he increases his power over men.  And over the world, wherever I\nhave gone, during all the years, it has been the same.  It may be a\ncabaret in the Latin Quarter, a cafe in some obscure Italian village, a\nboozing ken in sailor-town, and it may be up at the club over Scotch and\nsoda; but always it will be where John Barleycorn makes fellowship that I\nget immediately in touch, and meet, and know.  And in the good days\ncoming, when John Barleycorn will have been banished out of existence\nalong with the other barbarisms, some other institution than the saloon\nwill have to obtain, some other congregating place of men where strange\nmen and stranger men may get in touch, and meet, and know.\n\nBut to return to my narrative.  When I turned my back on Benicia, my way\nled through saloons.  I had developed no moral theories against drinking,\nand I disliked as much as ever the taste of the stuff.  But I had grown\nrespectfully suspicious of John Barleycorn.  I could not forget that\ntrick he had played on me--on me who did not want to die.  So I continued\nto drink, and to keep a sharp eye on John Barleycorn, resolved to resist\nall future suggestions of self-destruction.\n\nIn strange towns I made immediate acquaintances in the saloons.  When I\nhoboed, and hadn't the price of a bed, a saloon was the only place that\nwould receive me and give me a chair by the fire.  I could go into a\nsaloon and wash up, brush my clothes, and comb my hair.  And saloons were\nalways so damnably convenient.  They were everywhere in my western\ncountry.\n\nI couldn't go into the dwellings of strangers that way.  Their doors were\nnot open to me; no seats were there for me by their fires.  Also,\nchurches and preachers I had never known.  And from what I didn't know I\nwas not attracted toward them.  Besides, there was no glamour about them,\nno haze of romance, no promise of adventure.  They were the sort with\nwhom things never happened.  They lived and remained always in the one\nplace, creatures of order and system, narrow, limited, restrained.  They\nwere without greatness, without imagination, without camaraderie.  It was\nthe good fellows, easy and genial, daring, and, on occasion, mad, that I\nwanted to know--the fellows, generous-hearted and -handed, and not\nrabbit-hearted.\n\nAnd here is another complaint I bring against John Barleycorn.  It is\nthese good fellows that he gets--the fellows with the fire and the go in\nthem, who have bigness, and warmness, and the best of the human\nweaknesses.  And John Barleycorn puts out the fire, and soddens the\nagility, and, when he does not more immediately kill them or make maniacs\nof them, he coarsens and grossens them, twists and malforms them out of\nthe original goodness and fineness of their natures.\n\nOh!--and I speak out of later knowledge--Heaven forefend me from the most\nof the average run of male humans who are not good fellows, the ones cold\nof heart and cold of head who don't smoke, drink, or swear, or do much of\nanything else that is brase, and resentful, and stinging, because in\ntheir feeble fibres there has never been the stir and prod of life to\nwell over its boundaries and be devilish and daring.  One doesn't meet\nthese in saloons, nor rallying to lost causes, nor flaming on the\nadventure-paths, nor loving as God's own mad lovers.  They are too busy\nkeeping their feet dry, conserving their heart-beats, and making unlovely\nlife-successes of their spirit-mediocrity.\n\nAnd so I draw the indictment home to John Barleycorn.  It is just those,\nthe good fellows, the worth while, the fellows with the weakness of too\nmuch strength, too much spirit, too much fire and flame of fine\ndevilishness, that he solicits and ruins.  Of course, he ruins weaklings;\nbut with them, the worst we breed, I am not here concerned.  My concern\nis that it is so much of the best we breed whom John Barleycorn destroys.\nAnd the reason why these best are destroyed is because John Barleycorn\nstands on every highway and byway, accessible, law-protected, saluted by\nthe policeman on the beat, speaking to them, leading them by the hand to\nthe places where the good fellows and daring ones forgather and drink\ndeep.  With John Barleycorn out of the way, these daring ones would still\nbe born, and they would do things instead of perishing.\n\nAlways I encountered the camaraderie of drink.  I might be walking down\nthe track to the water-tank to lie in wait for a passing freight-train,\nwhen I would chance upon a bunch of \"alki-stiffs.\" An alki-stiff is a\ntramp who drinks druggist's alcohol.  Immediately, with greeting and\nsalutation, I am taken into the fellowship.  The alcohol, shrewdly\nblended with water, is handed to me, and soon I am caught up in the\nrevelry, with maggots crawling in my brain and John Barleycorn whispering\nto me that life is big, and that we are all brave and fine--free spirits\nsprawling like careless gods upon the turf and telling the two-by-four,\ncut-and-dried, conventional world to go hang.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nBack in Oakland from my wanderings, I returned to the water-front and\nrenewed my comradeship with Nelson, who was now on shore all the time and\nliving more madly than before.  I, too, spent my time on shore with him,\nonly occasionally going for cruises of several days on the bay to help\nout on short-handed scow-schooners.\n\nThe result was that I was no longer reinvigorated by periods of open-air\nabstinence and healthy toil.  I drank every day, and whenever opportunity\noffered I drank to excess; for I still laboured under the misconception\nthat the secret of John Barleycorn lay in drinking to bestiality and\nunconsciousness.  I became pretty thoroughly alcohol-soaked during this\nperiod.  I practically lived in saloons; became a bar-room loafer, and\nworse.\n\nAnd right here was John Barleycorn getting me in a more insidious though\nno less deadly way than when he nearly sent me out with the tide.  I had\na few months still to run before I was seventeen; I scorned the thought\nof a steady job at anything; I felt myself a pretty tough individual in a\ngroup of pretty tough men; and I drank because these men drank and\nbecause I had to make good with them.  I had never had a real boyhood,\nand in this, my precocious manhood, I was very hard and woefully wise.\nThough I had never known girl's love even, I had crawled through such\ndepths that I was convinced absolutely that I knew the last word about\nlove and life.  And it wasn't a pretty knowledge.  Without being\npessimistic, I was quite satisfied that life was a rather cheap and\nordinary affair.\n\nYou see, John Barleycorn was blunting me.  The old stings and prods of\nthe spirit were no longer sharp.  Curiosity was leaving me.  What did it\nmatter what lay on the other side of the world?  Men and women, without\ndoubt, very much like the men and women I knew; marrying and giving in\nmarriage and all the petty run of petty human concerns; and drinks, too.\nBut the other side of the world was a long way to go for a drink.  I had\nbut to step to the corner and get all I wanted at Joe Vigy's.  Johnny\nHeinhold still ran the Last Chance.  And there were saloons on all the\ncorners and between the corners.\n\nThe whispers from the back of life were growing dim as my mind and body\nsoddened.  The old unrest was drowsy.  I might as well rot and die here\nin Oakland as anywhere else.  And I should have so rotted and died, and\nnot in very long order either, at the pace John Barleycorn was leading\nme, had the matter depended wholly on him.  I was learning what it was to\nhave no appetite.  I was learning what it was to get up shaky in the\nmorning, with a stomach that quivered, with fingers touched with palsy,\nand to know the drinker's need for a stiff glass of whisky neat in order\nto brace up.  (Oh! John Barleycorn is a wizard dopester.  Brain and body,\nscorched and jangled and poisoned, return to be tuned up by the very\npoison that caused the damage.)\n\nThere is no end to John Barleycorn's tricks.  He had tried to inveigle me\ninto killing myself.  At this period he was doing his best to kill me at\na fairly rapid pace.  But, not satisfied with that, he tried another\ndodge.  He very nearly got me, too, and right there I learned a lesson\nabout him--became a wiser, a more skilful drinker.  I learned there were\nlimits to my gorgeous constitution, and that there were no limits to John\nBarleycorn.  I learned that in a short hour or two he could master my\nstrong head, my broad shoulders and deep chest, put me on my back, and\nwith a devil's grip on my throat proceed to choke the life out of me.\n\nNelson and I were sitting in the Overland House.  It was early in the\nevening, and the only reason we were there was because we were broke and\nit was election time.  You see, in election time local politicians,\naspirants for office, have a way of making the rounds of the saloons to\nget votes.  One is sitting at a table, in a dry condition, wondering who\nis going to turn up and buy him a drink, or if his credit is good at some\nother saloon and if it's worth while to walk that far to find out, when\nsuddenly the saloon doors swing wide, and enters a bevy of well-dressed\nmen, themselves usually wide and exhaling an atmosphere of prosperity and\nfellowship.\n\nThey have smiles and greetings for everybody--for you, without the price\nof a glass of beer in your pocket, for the timid hobo who lurks in the\ncorner and who certainly hasn't a vote, but who may establish a\nlodging-house registration.  And do you know, when these politicians\nswing wide the doors and come in, with their broad shoulders, their deep\nchests, and their generous stomachs which cannot help making them\noptimists and masters of life, why, you perk right up.  It's going to be\na warm evening after all, and you know you'll get a souse started at the\nvery least.\n\nAnd--who knows?--the gods may be kind, other drinks may come, and the\nnight culminate in glorious greatness.  And the next thing you know, you\nare lined up at the bar, pouring drinks down your throat and learning the\ngentlemen's names and the offices which they hope to fill.\n\nIt was during this period, when the politicians went their saloon rounds,\nthat I was getting bitter bits of education and having illusions\npunctured--I, who had pored and thrilled over \"The Rail-Splitter,\" and\n\"From Canal Boy to President.\" Yes, I was learning how noble politics and\npoliticians are.\n\nWell, on this night, broke, thirsty, but with the drinker's faith in the\nunexpected drink, Nelson and I sat in the Overland House waiting for\nsomething to turn up, especially politicians.  And there entered Joe\nGoose--he of the unquenchable thirst, the wicked eyes, the crooked nose,\nthe flowered vest.\n\n\"Come on, fellows--free booze--all you want of it.  I didn't want you to\nmiss it.\"\n\n\"Where?\" we wanted to know.\n\n\"Come on.  I'll tell you as we go along.  We haven't a minute to lose.\"\nAnd as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained: \"It's the Hancock Fire\nBrigade.  All you have to do is wear a red shirt and a helmet, and carry\na torch.\n\n\"They're going down on a special train to Haywards to parade.\"\n\n(I think the place was Haywards.  It may have been San Leandro or Niles.\nAnd, to save me, I can't remember whether the Hancock Fire Brigade was a\nrepublican or a democratic organisation.  But anyway, the politicians who\nran it were short of torch-bearers, and anybody who would parade could\nget drunk if he wanted to.)\n\n\"The town'll be wide open,\" Joe Goose went on.  \"Booze? It'll run like\nwater.  The politicians have bought the stocks of the saloons.  There'll\nbe no charge.  All you got to do is walk right up and call for it.  We'll\nraise hell.\"\n\nAt the hall, on Eighth Street near Broadway, we got into the firemen's\nshirts and helmets, were equipped with torches, and, growling because we\nweren't given at least one drink before we started, were herded aboard\nthe train.  Oh, those politicians had handled our kind before.  At\nHaywards there were no drinks either.  Parade first, and earn your booze,\nwas the order of the night.\n\nWe paraded.  Then the saloons were opened.  Extra barkeepers had been\nengaged, and the drinkers jammed six deep before every drink-drenched and\nunwiped bar.  There was no time to wipe the bar, nor wash glasses, nor do\nanything save fill glasses.  The Oakland water-front can be real thirsty\non occasion.\n\nThis method of jamming and struggling in front of the bar was too slow\nfor us.  The drink was ours.  The politicians had bought it for us.  We'd\nparaded and earned it, hadn't we? So we made a flank attack around the\nend of the bar, shoved the protesting barkeepers aside, and helped\nourselves to bottles.\n\nOutside, we knocked the necks of the bottles off against the concrete\ncurbs, and drank.  Now Joe Goose and Nelson had learned discretion with\nstraight whisky, drunk in quantity.  I hadn't.  I still laboured under\nthe misconception that one was to drink all he could get--especially when\nit didn't cost anything.  We shared our bottles with others, and drank a\ngood portion ourselves, while I drank most of all.  And I didn't like the\nstuff.  I drank it as I had drunk beer at five, and wine at seven.  I\nmastered my qualms and downed it like so much medicine.  And when we\nwanted more bottles, we went into other saloons where the free drink was\nflowing, and helped ourselves.\n\nI haven't the slightest idea of how much I drank--whether it was two\nquarts or five.  I do know that I began the orgy with half-pint draughts\nand with no water afterward to wash the taste away or to dilute the\nwhisky.\n\nNow the politicians were too wise to leave the town filled with drunks\nfrom the water-front of Oakland.  When train time came, there was a\nround-up of the saloons.  Already I was feeling the impact of the whisky.\nNelson and I were hustled out of a saloon, and found ourselves in the\nvery last rank of a disorderly parade.  I struggled along heroically, my\ncorrelations breaking down, my legs tottering under me, my head swimming,\nmy heart pounding, my lungs panting for air.\n\nMy helplessness was coming on so rapidly that my reeling brain told me I\nwould go down and out and never reach the train if I remained at the rear\nof the procession.  I left the ranks and ran down a pathway beside the\nroad under broad-spreading trees.  Nelson pursued me, laughing.  Certain\nthings stand out, as in memories of nightmare.  I remember those trees\nespecially, and my desperate running along under them, and how, every\ntime I fell, roars of laughter went up from the other drunks.  They\nthought I was merely antic drunk.  They did not dream that John\nBarleycorn had me by the throat in a death-clutch.  But I knew it.  And I\nremember the fleeting bitterness that was mine as I realised that I was\nin a struggle with death, and that these others did not know.  It was as\nif I were drowning before a crowd of spectators who thought I was cutting\nup tricks for their entertainment.\n\nAnd running there under the trees, I fell and lost consciousness.  What\nhappened afterward, with one glimmering exception, I had to be told.\nNelson, with his enormous strength, picked me up and dragged me on and\naboard the train.  When he had got me into a seat, I fought and panted so\nterribly for air that even with his obtuseness he knew I was in a bad\nway.  And right there, at any moment, I know now, I might have died.  I\noften think it is the nearest to death I have ever been.  I have only\nNelson's description of my behaviour to go by.\n\nI was scorching up, burning alive internally, in an agony of fire and\nsuffocation, and I wanted air.  I madly wanted air.  My efforts to raise\na window were vain, for all the windows in the car were screwed down.\nNelson had seen drink-crazed men, and thought I wanted to throw myself\nout.  He tried to restrain me, but I fought on.  I seized some man's\ntorch and smashed the glass.\n\nNow there were pro-Nelson and anti-Nelson factions on the Oakland\nwater-front, and men of both factions, with more drink in them than was\ngood, filled the car.  My smashing of the window was the signal for the\nantis.  One of them reached for me, and dropped me, and started the\nfight, of all of which I have no knowledge save what was told me\nafterward, and a sore jaw next day from the blow that put me out.  The\nman who struck me went down across my body, Nelson followed him, and they\nsay there were few unbroken windows in the wreckage of the car that\nfollowed as the free-for-all fight had its course.\n\nThis being knocked cold and motionless was perhaps the best thing that\ncould have happened to me.  My violent struggles had only accelerated my\nalready dangerously accelerated heart, and increased the need for oxygen\nin my suffocating lungs.\n\nAfter the fight was over and I came to, I did not come to myself.  I was\nno more myself than a drowning man is who continues to struggle after he\nhas lost consciousness.  I have no memory of my actions, but I cried\n\"Air! Air!\" so insistently, that it dawned on Nelson that I did not\ncontemplate self-destruction.  So he cleared the jagged glass from the\nwindow-ledge and let me stick my head and shoulders out.  He realised,\npartially, the seriousness of my condition, and held me by the waist to\nprevent me from crawling farther out.  And for the rest of the run in to\nOakland I kept my head and shoulders out, fighting like a maniac whenever\nhe tried to draw me inside.\n\nAnd here my one glimmering streak of true consciousness came.  My sole\nrecollection, from the time I fell under the trees until I awoke the\nfollowing evening, is of my head out of the window, facing the wind\ncaused by the train, cinders striking and burning and blinding me, while\nI breathed with will.  All my will was concentrated on breathing--on\nbreathing the air in the hugest lung-full gulps I could, pumping the\ngreatest amount of air into my lungs in the shortest possible time.  It\nwas that or death, and I was a swimmer and diver, and I knew it; and in\nthe most intolerable agony of prolonged suffocation, during those moments\nI was conscious, I faced the wind and the cinders and breathed for life.\n\nAll the rest is a blank.  I came to the following evening, in a\nwater-front lodging-house.  I was alone.  No doctor had been called in.\nAnd I might well have died there, for Nelson and the others, deeming me\nmerely \"sleeping off my drunk,\" had let me lie there in a comatose\ncondition for seventeen hours.  Many a man, as every doctor knows, has\ndied of the sudden impact of a quart or more of whisky.  Usually one\nreads of them so dying, strong drinkers, on account of a wager.  But I\ndidn't know--then.  And so I learned; and by no virtue nor prowess, but\nsimply through good fortune and constitution.  Again my constitution had\ntriumphed over John Barleycorn.  I had escaped from another death-pit,\ndragged myself through another morass, and perilously acquired the\ndiscretion that would enable me to drink wisely for many another year to\ncome.\n\nHeavens! That was twenty years ago, and I am still very much and wisely\nalive; and I have seen much, done much, lived much, in that intervening\nscore of years; and I shudder when I think how close a shave I ran, how\nnear I was to missing that splendid fifth of a century that has been\nmine.  And, oh, it wasn't John Barleycorn's fault that he didn't get me\nthat night of the Hancock Fire Brigade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nIt was during the early winter of 1892 that I resolved to go to sea.  My\nHancock Fire Brigade experience was very little responsible for this.  I\nstill drank and frequented saloons--practically lived in saloons.  Whisky\nwas dangerous, in my opinion, but not wrong.  Whisky was dangerous like\nother dangerous things in the natural world.  Men died of whisky; but\nthen, too, fishermen were capsized and drowned, hoboes fell under trains\nand were cut to pieces.  To cope with winds and waves, railroad trains,\nand bar-rooms, one must use judgment.  To get drunk after the manner of\nmen was all right, but one must do it with discretion.  No more quarts of\nwhisky for me.\n\nWhat really decided me to go to sea was that I had caught my first vision\nof the death-road which John Barleycorn maintains for his devotees.  It\nwas not a clear vision, however, and there were two phases of it,\nsomewhat jumbled at the time.  It struck me, from watching those with\nwhom I associated, that the life we were living was more destructive than\nthat lived by the average man.\n\nJohn Barleycorn, by inhibiting morality, incited to crime.  Everywhere I\nsaw men doing, drunk, what they would never dream of doing sober.  And\nthis wasn't the worst of it.  It was the penalty that must be paid.\nCrime was destructive.  Saloon-mates I drank with, who were good fellows\nand harmless, sober, did most violent and lunatic things when they were\ndrunk.  And then the police gathered them in and they vanished from our\nken.  Sometimes I visited them behind the bars and said good-bye ere they\njourneyed across the bay to put on the felon's stripes.  And time and\nagain I heard the one explanation \"IF I HADN'T BEEN DRUNK I WOULDN'T\nA-DONE IT.\"  And sometimes, under the spell of John Barleycorn, the most\nfrightful things were done--things that shocked even my case-hardened\nsoul.\n\nThe other phase of the death-road was that of the habitual drunkards, who\nhad a way of turning up their toes without apparent provocation.  When\nthey took sick, even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man\ncould pull through, they just pegged out.  Sometimes they were found\nunattended and dead in their beds; on occasion their bodies were dragged\nout of the water; and sometimes it was just plain accident, as when Bill\nKelley, unloading cargo while drunk, had a finger jerked off, which,\nunder the circumstances, might just as easily have been his head.\n\nSo I considered my situation and knew that I was getting into a bad way\nof living.  It made toward death too quickly to suit my youth and\nvitality.  And there was only one way out of this hazardous manner of\nliving, and that was to get out.  The sealing fleet was wintering in San\nFrancisco Bay, and in the saloons I met skippers, mates, hunters,\nboat-steerers, and boat-pullers.  I met the seal-hunter, Pete Holt, and\nagreed to be his boat-puller and to sign on any schooner he signed on.\nAnd I had to have half a dozen drinks with Pete Holt there and then to\nseal our agreement.\n\nAnd at once awoke all my old unrest that John Barleycorn had put to\nsleep.  I found myself actually bored with the saloon life of the Oakland\nwater-front, and wondered what I had ever found fascinating in it.  Also,\nwith this death-road concept in my brain, I began to grow afraid that\nsomething would happen to me before sailing day, which was set for some\ntime in January.  I lived more circumspectly, drank less deeply, and went\nhome more frequently.  When drinking grew too wild, I got out.  When\nNelson was in his maniacal cups, I managed to get separated from him.\n\nOn the 12th of January, 1893, I was seventeen, and the 20th of January I\nsigned before the shipping commissioner the articles of the Sophie\nSutherland, a three topmast sealing schooner bound on a voyage to the\ncoast of Japan.  And of course we had to drink on it.  Joe Vigy cashed my\nadvance note, and Pete Holt treated, and I treated, and Joe Vigy treated,\nand other hunters treated.  Well, it was the way of men, and who was I,\njust turned seventeen, that I should decline the way of life of these\nfine, chesty, man-grown men?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nThere was nothing to drink on the Sophie Sutherland, and we had fifty-one\ndays of glorious sailing, taking the southern passage in the north-east\ntrades to Bonin Islands.  This isolated group, belonging to Japan, had\nbeen selected as the rendezvous of the Canadian and American sealing\nfleets.  Here they filled their water-barrels and made repairs before\nstarting on the hundred days' harrying of the seal-herd along the\nnorthern coasts of Japan to Behring Sea.\n\nThose fifty-one days of fine sailing and intense sobriety had put me in\nsplendid fettle.  The alcohol had been worked out of my system, and from\nthe moment the voyage began I had not known the desire for a drink.  I\ndoubt if I even thought once about a drink.  Often, of course, the talk\nin the forecastle turned on drink, and the men told of their more\nexciting or humorous drunks, remembering such passages more keenly, with\ngreater delight, than all the other passages of their adventurous lives.\n\nIn the forecastle, the oldest man, fat and fifty, was Louis.  He was a\nbroken skipper.  John Barleycorn had thrown him, and he was winding up\nhis career where he had begun it, in the forecastle.  His case made quite\nan impression on me.  John Barleycorn did other things beside kill a man.\nHe hadn't killed Louis.  He had done much worse.  He had robbed him of\npower and place and comfort, crucified his pride, and condemned him to\nthe hardship of the common sailor that would last as long as his healthy\nbreath lasted, which promised to be for a long time.\n\nWe completed our run across the Pacific, lifted the volcanic peaks,\njungle-clad, of the Bonin Islands, sailed in among the reefs to the\nland-locked harbour, and let our anchor rumble down where lay a score or\nmore of sea-gypsies like ourselves.  The scents of strange vegetation\nblew off the tropic land.  Aborigines, in queer outrigger canoes, and\nJapanese, in queerer sampans, paddled about the bay and came aboard.  It\nwas my first foreign land; I had won to the other side of the world, and\nI would see all I had read in the books come true.  I was wild to get\nashore.\n\nVictor and Axel, a Swede and a Norwegian, and I planned to keep together.\n(And so well did we, that for the rest of the cruise we were known as the\n\"Three Sports.\") Victor pointed out a pathway that disappeared up a wild\ncanyon, emerged on a steep bare lava slope, and thereafter appeared and\ndisappeared, ever climbing, among the palms and flowers.  We would go\nover that path, he said, and we agreed, and we would see beautiful\nscenery, and strange native villages, and find, Heaven alone knew, what\nadventure at the end.  And Axel was keen to go fishing.  The three of us\nagreed to that, too.  We would get a sampan, and a couple of Japanese\nfishermen who knew the fishing grounds, and we would have great sport.\nAs for me, I was keen for anything.\n\nAnd then, our plans made, we rowed ashore over the banks of living coral\nand pulled our boat up the white beach of coral sand.  We walked across\nthe fringe of beach under the cocoanut-palms and into the little town,\nand found several hundred riotous seamen from all the world, drinking\nprodigiously, singing prodigiously, dancing prodigiously--and all on the\nmain street to the scandal of a helpless handful of Japanese police.\n\nVictor and Axel said that we'd have a drink before we started on our long\nwalk.  Could I decline to drink with these two chesty shipmates?\nDrinking together, glass in hand, put the seal on comradeship.  It was\nthe way of life.  Our teetotaler owner-captain was laughed at, and\nsneered at, by all of us because of his teetotalism.  I didn't in the\nleast want a drink, but I did want to be a good fellow and a good\ncomrade.  Nor did Louis' case deter me, as I poured the biting, scorching\nstuff down my throat.  John Barleycorn had thrown Louis to a nasty fall,\nbut I was young.  My blood ran full and red; I had a constitution of\niron; and--well, youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age.\n\nQueer, fierce, alcoholic stuff it was that we drank.  There was no\ntelling where or how it had been manufactured--some native concoction\nmost likely.  But it was hot as fire, pale as water, and quick as death\nwith its kick.  It had been filled into empty \"square-face\" bottles which\nhad once contained Holland gin, and which still bore the fitting legend\n\"Anchor Brand.\" It certainly anchored us.  We never got out of the town.\nWe never went fishing in the sampan.  And though we were there ten days,\nwe never trod that wild path along the lava cliffs and among the flowers.\n\nWe met old acquaintances from other schooners, fellows we had met in the\nsaloons of San Francisco before we sailed.  And each meeting meant a\ndrink; and there was much to talk about; and more drinks; and songs to be\nsung; and pranks and antics to be performed, until the maggots of\nimagination began to crawl, and it all seemed great and wonderful to me,\nthese lusty hard-bitten sea-rovers, of whom I made one, gathered in\nwassail on a coral strand.  Old lines about knights at table in the great\nbanquet halls, and of those above the salt and below the salt, and of\nVikings feasting fresh from sea and ripe for battle, came to me; and I\nknew that the old times were not dead and that we belonged to that\nselfsame ancient breed.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Victor went mad with drink, and wanted to fight\neverybody and everything.  I have since seen lunatics in the violent\nwards of asylums that seemed to behave in no wise different from Victor's\nway, save that perhaps he was more violent.  Axel and I interfered as\npeacemakers, were roughed and jostled in the mix-ups, and finally, with\ninfinite precaution and intoxicated cunning, succeeded in inveigling our\nchum down to the boat and in rowing him aboard our schooner.\n\nBut no sooner did Victor's feet touch the deck than he began to clean up\nthe ship.  He had the strength of several men, and he ran amuck with it.\nI remember especially one man whom he got into the chain-boxes but failed\nto damage through inability to hit him.  The man dodged and ducked, and\nVictor broke all the knuckles of both his fists against the huge links of\nthe anchor chain.  By the time we dragged him out of that, his madness\nhad shifted to the belief that he was a great swimmer, and the next\nmoment he was overboard and demonstrating his ability by floundering like\na sick porpoise and swallowing much salt water.\n\nWe rescued him, and by the time we got him below, undressed, and into his\nbunk, we were wrecks ourselves.  But Axel and I wanted to see more of\nshore, and away we went, leaving Victor snoring.  It was curious, the\njudgment passed on Victor by his shipmates, drinkers themselves.  They\nshook their heads disapprovingly and muttered: \"A man like that oughtn't\nto drink.\" Now Victor was the smartest sailor and best-tempered shipmate\nin the forecastle.  He was an all-round splendid type of seaman; his\nmates recognised his worth, and respected him and liked him.  Yet John\nBarleycorn metamorphosed him into a violent lunatic.  And that was the\nvery point these drinkers made.  They knew that drink--and drink with a\nsailor is always excessive--made them mad, but only mildly mad.  Violent\nmadness was objectionable because it spoiled the fun of others and often\nculminated in tragedy.  From their standpoint, mild madness was all\nright.  But from the standpoint of the whole human race, is not all\nmadness objectionable? And is there a greater maker of madness of all\nsorts than John Barleycorn?\n\nBut to return.  Ashore, snugly ensconced in a Japanese house of\nentertainment, Axel and I compared bruises, and over a comfortable drink\ntalked of the afternoon's happenings.  We liked the quietness of that\ndrink and took another.  A shipmate dropped in, several shipmates dropped\nin, and we had more quiet drinks.  Finally, just as we had engaged a\nJapanese orchestra, and as the first strains of the samisens and taikos\nwere rising, through the paper-walls came a wild howl from the street.\nWe recognised it.  Still howling, disdaining doorways, with blood-shot\neyes and wildly waving muscular arms, Victor burst upon us through the\nfragile walls.  The old amuck rage was on him, and he wanted blood,\nanybody's blood.  The orchestra fled; so did we.  We went through\ndoorways, and we went through paper-walls--anything to get away.\n\nAnd after the place was half wrecked, and we had agreed to pay the\ndamage, leaving Victor partly subdued and showing symptoms of lapsing\ninto a comatose state, Axel and I wandered away in quest of a quieter\ndrinking-place.  The main street was a madness.  Hundreds of sailors\nrollicked up and down.  Because the chief of police with his small force\nwas helpless, the governor of the colony had issued orders to the\ncaptains to have all their men on board by sunset.\n\nWhat! To be treated in such fashion! As the news spread among the\nschooners, they were emptied.  Everybody came ashore.  Men who had had no\nintention of coming ashore climbed into the boats.  The unfortunate\ngovernor's ukase had precipitated a general debauch for all hands.  It\nwas hours after sunset, and the men wanted to see anybody try to put them\non board.  They went around inviting the authorities to try to put them\non board.  In front of the governor's house they were gathered thickest,\nbawling sea-songs, circulating square faces, and dancing uproarious\nVirginia reels and old-country dances.  The police, including the\nreserves, stood in little forlorn groups, waiting for the command the\ngovernor was too wise to issue.  And I thought this saturnalia was great.\nIt was like the old days of the Spanish Main come back.  It was license;\nit was adventure.  And I was part of it, a chesty sea-rover along with\nall these other chesty sea-rovers among the paper houses of Japan.\n\nThe governor never issued the order to clear the streets, and Axel and I\nwandered on from drink to drink.  After a time, in some of the antics,\ngetting hazy myself, I lost him.  I drifted along, making new\nacquaintances, downing more drinks, getting hazier and hazier.  I\nremember, somewhere, sitting in a circle with Japanese fishermen, Kanaka\nboat-steerers from our own vessels, and a young Danish sailor fresh from\ncowboying in the Argentine and with a penchant for native customs and\nceremonials.  And with due and proper and most intricate Japanese\nceremonial we of the circle drank saki, pale, mild, and lukewarm, from\ntiny porcelain bowls.\n\nAnd, later, I remember the runaway apprentices--boys of eighteen and\ntwenty, of middle class English families, who had jumped their ships and\napprenticeships in various ports of the world and drifted into the\nforecastles of the sealing schooners.  They were healthy, smooth-skinned,\nclear-eyed, and they were young--youths like me, learning the way of\ntheir feet in the world of men.  And they WERE men.  No mild saki for\nthem, but square faces illicitly refilled with corrosive fire that flamed\nthrough their veins and burst into conflagrations in their heads.  I\nremember a melting song they sang, the refrain of which was:\n\n   \"'Tis but a little golden ring,\n      I give it to thee with pride,\n    Wear it for your mother's sake\n      When you are on the tide.\"\n\n\nThey wept over it as they sang it, the graceless young scamps who had all\nbroken their mothers' prides, and I sang with them, and wept with them,\nand luxuriated in the pathos and the tragedy of it, and struggled to make\nglimmering inebriated generalisations on life and romance.  And one last\npicture I have, standing out very clear and bright in the midst of\nvagueness before and blackness afterward.  We--the apprentices and I--are\nswaying and clinging to one another under the stars.  We are singing a\nrollicking sea song, all save one who sits on the ground and weeps; and\nwe are marking the rhythm with waving square faces.  From up and down the\nstreet come far choruses of sea-voices similarly singing, and life is\ngreat, and beautiful and romantic, and magnificently mad.\n\nAnd next, after the blackness, I open my eyes in the early dawn to see a\nJapanese woman, solicitously anxious, bending over me.  She is the port\npilot's wife and I am lying in her doorway.  I am chilled and shivering,\nsick with the after-sickness of debauch.  And I feel lightly clad.  Those\nrascals of runaway apprentices!  They have acquired the habit of running\naway.  They have run away with my possessions.  My watch is gone.  My few\ndollars are gone.  My coat is gone.  So is my belt.  And yes, my shoes.\n\nAnd the foregoing is a sample of the ten days I spent in the Bonin\nIslands.  Victor got over his lunacy, rejoined Axel and me, and after\nthat we caroused somewhat more discreetly.  And we never climbed that\nlava path among the flowers.  The town and the square faces were all we\nsaw.\n\nOne who has been burned by fire must preach about the fire.  I might have\nseen and healthily enjoyed a whole lot more of the Bonin Islands, if I\nhad done what I ought to have done.  But, as I see it, it is not a matter\nof what one ought to do, or ought not to do.  It is what one DOES do.\nThat is the everlasting, irrefragable fact.  I did just what I did.  I\ndid what all those men did in the Bonin Islands.  I did what millions of\nmen over the world were doing at that particular point in time.  I did it\nbecause the way led to it, because I was only a human boy, a creature of\nmy environment, and neither an anaemic nor a god.  I was just human, and\nI was taking the path in the world that men took--men whom I admired, if\nyou please; full-blooded men, lusty, breedy, chesty men, free spirits and\nanything but niggards in the way they foamed life away.\n\nAnd the way was open.  It was like an uncovered well in a yard where\nchildren play.  It is small use to tell the brave little boys toddling\ntheir way along into knowledge of life that they mustn't play near the\nuncovered well.  They'll play near it.  Any parent knows that.  And we\nknow that a certain percentage of them, the livest and most daring, will\nfall into the well.  The thing to do--we all know it--is to cover up the\nwell.  The case is the same with John Barleycorn.  All the no-saying and\nno-preaching in the world will fail to keep men, and youths growing into\nmanhood, away from John Barleycorn when John Barleycorn is everywhere\naccessible, and where John Barleycorn is everywhere the connotation of\nmanliness, and daring, and great-spiritedness.\n\nThe only rational thing for the twentieth-century folk to do is to cover\nup the well; to make the twentieth century in truth the twentieth\ncentury, and to relegate to the nineteenth century and all the preceding\ncenturies the things of those centuries, the witch-burnings, the\nintolerances, the fetiches, and, not least among such barbarisms,  John\nBarleycorn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nNorth we raced from the Bonin Islands to pick up the seal-herd, and north\nwe hunted it for a hundred days into frosty, mitten weather and into and\nthrough vast fogs which hid the sun from us for a week at a time.  It was\nwild and heavy work, without a drink or thought of drink.  Then we sailed\nsouth to Yokohama, with a big catch of skins in our salt and a heavy\npay-day coming.\n\nI was eager to be ashore and see Japan, but the first day was devoted to\nship's work, and not until evening did we sailors land.  And here, by the\nvery system of things, by the way life was organised and men transacted\naffairs, John Barleycorn reached out and tucked my arm in his.  The\ncaptain had given money for us to the hunters, and the hunters were\nwaiting in a certain Japanese public house for us to come and get it.  We\nrode to the place in rickshaws.  Our own crowd had taken possession of\nit.  Drink was flowing.  Everybody had money, and everybody was treating.\nAfter the hundred days of hard toil and absolute abstinence, in the pink\nof physical condition, bulging with health, over-spilling with spirits\nthat had long been pent by discipline and circumstance, of course we\nwould have a drink or two.  And after that we would see the town.\n\nIt was the old story.  There were so many drinks to be drunk, and as the\nwarm magic poured through our veins and mellowed our voices and\naffections we knew it was no time to make invidious distinctions--to\ndrink with this shipmate and to decline to drink with that shipmate.  We\nwere all shipmates who had been through stress and storm together, who\nhad pulled and hauled on the same sheets and tackles, relieved one\nanother's wheels, laid out side by side on the same jib-boom when she was\nplunging into it and looked to see who was missing when she cleared and\nlifted.  So we drank with all, and all treated, and our voices rose, and\nwe remembered a myriad kindly acts of comradeship, and forgot our fights\nand wordy squabbles, and knew one another for the best fellows in the\nworld.\n\nWell, the night was young when we arrived in that public house, and for\nall of that first night that public house was what I saw of Japan--a\ndrinking-place which was very like a drinking-place at home or anywhere\nelse over the world.\n\nWe lay in Yokohama harbour for two weeks, and about all we saw of Japan\nwas its drinking-places where sailors congregated.  Occasionally, some\none of us varied the monotony with a more exciting drunk.  In such\nfashion I managed a real exploit by swimming off to the schooner one dark\nmidnight and going soundly to sleep while the water-police searched the\nharbour for my body and brought my clothes out for identification.\n\nPerhaps it was for things like that, I imagined, that men got drunk.  In\nour little round of living what I had done was a noteworthy event.  All\nthe harbour talked about it.  I enjoyed several days of fame among the\nJapanese boatmen and ashore in the pubs.  It was a red-letter event.  It\nwas an event to be remembered and narrated with pride.  I remember it\nto-day, twenty years afterward, with a secret glow of pride.  It was a\npurple passage, just as Victor's wrecking of the tea-house in the Bonin\nIslands and my being looted by the runaway apprentices were purple\npassages.\n\nThe point is that the charm of John Barleycorn was still a mystery to me.\nI was so organically a non-alcoholic that alcohol itself made no appeal;\nthe chemical reactions it produced in me were not satisfying because I\npossessed no need for such chemical satisfaction.  I drank because the\nmen I was with drank, and because my nature was such that I could not\npermit myself to be less of a man than other men at their favourite\npastime.  And I still had a sweet tooth, and on privy occasions when\nthere was no man to see, bought candy and blissfully devoured it.\n\nWe hove up anchor to a jolly chanty, and sailed out of Yokohama harbour\nfor San Francisco.  We took the northern passage, and with the stout west\nwind at our back made the run across the Pacific in thirty-seven days of\nbrave sailing.  We still had a big pay-day coming to us, and for\nthirty-seven days, without a drink to addle our mental processes, we\nincessantly planned the spending of our money.\n\nThe first statement of each man--ever an ancient one in homeward-bound\nforecastles--was: \"No boarding-house sharks in mine.\" Next, in\nparentheses, was regret at having spent so much money in Yokohama.  And\nafter that, each man proceeded to paint his favourite phantom.  Victor,\nfor instance, said that immediately he landed in San Francisco he would\npass right through the water-front and the Barbary Coast, and put an\nadvertisement in the papers.  His advertisement would be for board and\nroom in some simple working-class family.  \"Then,\" said Victor, \"I shall\ngo to some dancing-school for a week or two, just to meet and get\nacquainted with the girls and fellows.  Then I'll get the run of the\ndifferent dancing crowds, and be invited to their homes, and to parties,\nand all that, and with the money I've got I can last out till next\nJanuary, when I'll go sealing again.\"\n\nNo; he wasn't going to drink.  He knew the way of it, particularly his\nway of it, wine in, wit out, and his money would be gone in no time.  He\nhad his choice, based on bitter experience, between three days' debauch\namong the sharks and harpies of the Barbary Coast and a whole winter of\nwholesome enjoyment and sociability, and there wasn't any doubt of the\nway he was going to choose.\n\nSaid Axel Gunderson, who didn't care for dancing and social functions:\n\"I've got a good pay-day.  Now I can go home.  It is fifteen years since\nI've seen my mother and all the family.  When I pay off, I shall send my\nmoney home to wait for me.  Then I'll pick a good ship bound for Europe,\nand arrive there with another pay-day.  Put them together, and I'll have\nmore money than ever in my life before.  I'll be a prince at home.  You\nhaven't any idea how cheap everything is in Norway.  I can make presents\nto everybody, and spend my money like what would seem to them a\nmillionaire, and live a whole year there before I'd have to go back to\nsea.\"\n\n\"The very thing I'm going to do,\" declared Red John.  \"It's three years\nsince I've received a line from home and ten years since I was there.\nThings are just as cheap in Sweden, Axel, as in Norway, and my folks are\nreal country folk and farmers.  I'll send my pay-day home and ship on the\nsame ship with you for around the Horn.  We'll pick a good one.\"\n\nAnd as Axel Gunderson and Red John painted the pastoral delights and\nfestive customs of their respective countries, each fell in love with the\nother's home place, and they solemnly pledged to make the journey\ntogether, and to spend, together, six months in the one's Swedish home\nand six months in the other's Norwegian home.  And for the rest of the\nvoyage they could hardly be pried apart, so infatuated did they become\nwith discussing their plans.\n\nLong John was not a home-body.  But he was tired of the forecastle.  No\nboarding-house sharks in his.  He, too, would get a room in a quiet\nfamily, and he would go to a navigation school and study to be a captain.\nAnd so it went.  Each man swore that for once he would be sensible and\nnot squander his money.  No boarding-house sharks, no sailor-town, no\ndrink, was the slogan of our forecastle.\n\nThe men became stingy.  Never was there such economy.  They refused to\nbuy anything more from the slopchest.  Old rags had to last, and they\nsewed patch upon patch, turning out what are called \"homeward-bound\npatches\" of the most amazing proportions.  They saved on matches, even,\nwaiting till two or three were ready to light their pipes from the same\nmatch.\n\nAs we sailed up the San Francisco water-front, the moment the port\ndoctors passed us, the boarding-house runners were alongside in whitehall\nboats.  They swarmed on board, each drumming for his own boarding-house,\nand each with a bottle of free whisky inside his shirt.  But we waved\nthem grandly and blasphemously away.  We wanted none of their\nboarding-houses and none of their whisky.  We were sober, thrifty\nsailormen, with better use for our money.\n\nCame the paying off before the shipping commissioner.  We emerged upon\nthe sidewalk, each with a pocketful of money.  About us, like buzzards,\nclustered the sharks and harpies.  And we looked at each other.  We had\nbeen seven months together, and our paths were separating.  One last\nfarewell rite of comradeship remained.  (Oh, it was the way, the custom.)\n\"Come on, boys,\" said our sailing master.  There stood the inevitable\nadjacent saloon.  There were a dozen saloons all around.  And when we had\nfollowed the sailing master into the one of his choice, the sharks were\nthick on the sidewalk outside.  Some of them even ventured inside, but we\nwould have nothing to do with them.\n\nThere we stood at the long bar--the sailing master, the mate, the six\nhunters, the six boat-steerers, and the five boat-pullers.  There were\nonly five of the last, for one of our number had been dropped overboard,\nwith a sack of coal at his feet, between two snow squalls in a driving\ngale off Cape Jerimo.  There were nineteen of us and it was to be our\nlast drink together.  With seven months of men's work in the world, blow\nhigh, blow low, behind us, we were looking on each other for the last\ntime.  We knew it, for sailors' ways go wide.  And the nineteen of us\ndrank the sailing master's treat.  Then the mate looked at us with\neloquent eyes and called another round.  We liked the mate just as well\nas the sailing master, and we liked them both.  Could we drink with one,\nand not the other?\n\nAnd Pete Holt, my own hunter (lost next year in the Mary Thomas, with all\nhands), called a round.  The time passed, the drinks continued to come on\nthe bar, our voices rose, and the maggots began to crawl.  There were six\nhunters, and each insisted, in the sacred name of comradeship, that all\nhands drink with him just once.  There were six boat-steerers and five\nboat-pullers and the same logic held with them.  There was money in all\nour pockets, and our money was as good as any man's, and our hearts were\nas free and generous.\n\nNineteen rounds of drinks.  What more would John Barleycorn ask in order\nto have his will with men? They were ripe to forget their dearly\ncherished plans.  They rolled out of the saloon and into the arms of the\nsharks and harpies.  They didn't last long.  From two days to a week saw\nthe end of their money and saw them being carted by the boarding-house\nmasters on board outward-bound ships.  Victor was a fine body of a man,\nand through a lucky friendship managed to get into the life-saving\nservice.  He never saw the dancing-school nor placed his advertisement\nfor a room in a working-class family.  Nor did Long John win to\nnavigation school.  By the end of the week he was a transient lumper on a\nriver steamboat.  Red John and Axel did not send their pay-days home to\nthe old country.  Instead, and along with the rest, they were scattered\non board sailing ships bound for the four quarters of the globe, where\nthey had been placed by the boarding-house masters, and where they were\nworking out advance money which they had neither seen nor spent.\n\nWhat saved me was that I had a home and people to go to.  I crossed the\nbay to Oakland, and, among other things, took a look at the death-road.\nNelson was gone--shot to death while drunk and resisting the officers.\nHis partner in that affair was lying in prison.  Whisky Bob was gone.\nOld Cole, Old Smoudge, and Bob Smith were gone.  Another Smith, he of the\nbelted guns and the Annie, was drowned.  French Frank, they said, was\nlurking up river, afraid to come down because of something he had done.\nOthers were wearing the stripes in San Quentin or Folsom.  Big Alec, the\nKing of the Greeks, whom I had known well in the old Benicia days, and\nwith whom I had drunk whole nights through, had killed two men and fled\nto foreign parts.  Fitzsimmons, with whom I had sailed on the Fish\nPatrol, had been stabbed in the lung through the back and had died a\nlingering death complicated with tuberculosis.  And so it went, a very\nlively and well-patronised road, and, from what I knew of all of them,\nJohn Barleycorn was responsible, with the sole exception of Smith of the\nAnnie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nMy infatuation for the Oakland water-front was quite dead.  I didn't like\nthe looks of it, nor the life.  I didn't care for the drinking, nor the\nvagrancy of it, and I wandered back to the Oakland Free Library and read\nthe books with greater understanding.  Then, too, my mother said I had\nsown my wild oats and it was time I settled down to a regular job.  Also,\nthe family needed the money.  So I got a job at the jute mills--a\nten-hour day at ten cents an hour.  Despite my increase in strength and\ngeneral efficiency, I was receiving no more than when I worked in the\ncannery several years before.  But, then, there was a promise of a rise\nto a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months.  And here, so far as\nJohn Barleycorn is concerned, began a period of innocence.  I did not\nknow what it was to take a drink from month end to month end.  Not yet\neighteen years old, healthy and with labour-hardened but unhurt muscles,\nlike any young animal I needed diversion, excitement, something beyond\nthe books and the mechanical toil.\n\nI strayed into Young Men's Christian Associations.  The life there was\nhealthful and athletic, but too juvenile.  For me it was too late.  I was\nnot boy, nor youth, despite my paucity of years.  I had bucked big with\nmen.  I knew mysterious and violent things.  I was from the other side of\nlife so far as concerned the young men I encountered in the Y.M.C.A.  I\nspoke another language, possessed a sadder and more terrible wisdom.\n(When I come to think it over, I realise now that I have never had a\nboyhood.)  At any rate, the Y.M.C.A. young men were too juvenile for me,\ntoo unsophisticated.  This I would not have minded, could they have met\nme and helped me mentally.  But I had got more out of the books than\nthey.  Their meagre physical experiences, plus their meagre intellectual\nexperiences, made a negative sum so vast that it overbalanced their\nwholesome morality and healthful sports.\n\nIn short, I couldn't play with the pupils of a lower grade.  All the\nclean splendid young life that was theirs was denied me--thanks to my\nearlier tutelage under John Barleycorn.  I knew too much too young.  And\nyet, in the good time coming when alcohol is eliminated from the needs\nand the institutions of men, it will be the Y.M.C.A., and similar\nunthinkably better and wiser and more virile congregating-places, that\nwill receive the men who now go to saloons to find themselves and one\nanother.  In the meantime, we live to-day, here and now, and we discuss\nto-day, here and now.\n\nI was working ten hours a day in the jute mills.  It was hum-drum machine\ntoil.  I wanted life.  I wanted to realise myself in other ways than at a\nmachine for ten cents an hour.  And yet I had had my fill of saloons.  I\nwanted something new.  I was growing up.  I was developing unguessed and\ntroubling potencies and proclivities.  And at this very stage,\nfortunately, I met Louis Shattuck and we became chums.\n\nLouis Shattuck, without one vicious trait, was a real innocently devilish\nyoung fellow, who was quite convinced that he was a sophisticated town\nboy.  And I wasn't a town boy at all.  Louis was handsome, and graceful,\nand filled with love for the girls.  With him it was an exciting and\nall-absorbing pursuit.  I didn't know anything about girls.  I had been\ntoo busy being a man.  This was an entirely new phase of existence which\nhad escaped me.  And when I saw Louis say good-bye to me, raise his hat\nto a girl of his acquaintance, and walk on with her side by side down the\nsidewalk, I was made excited and envious.  I, too, wanted to play this\ngame.\n\n\"Well, there's only one thing to do,\" said Louis, \"and that is, you must\nget a girl.\"\n\nWhich is more difficult than it sounds.  Let me show you, at the expense\nof a slight going aside.  Louis did not know girls in their home life.\nHe had the entree to no girl's home.  And of course, I, a stranger in\nthis new world, was similarly circumstanced.  But, further, Louis and I\nwere unable to go to dancing-schools, or to public dances, which were\nvery good places for getting acquainted.  We didn't have the money.  He\nwas a blacksmith's apprentice, and was earning but slightly more than I.\nWe both lived at home and paid our way.  When we had done this, and\nbought our cigarettes, and the inevitable clothes and shoes, there\nremained to each of us, for personal spending, a sum that varied between\nseventy cents and a dollar for the week.  We whacked this up, shared it,\nand sometimes loaned all of what was left of it when one of us needed it\nfor some more gorgeous girl-adventure, such as car-fare out to Blair's\nPark and back--twenty cents, bang, just like that; and ice-cream for\ntwo--thirty cents; or tamales in a tamale-parlour, which came cheaper and\nwhich for two cost only twenty cents.\n\nI did not mind this money meagreness.  The disdain I had learned for\nmoney from the oyster pirates had never left me.  I didn't care\nover-weeningly for it for personal gratification; and in my philosophy I\ncompleted the circle, finding myself as equable with the lack of a\nten-cent piece as I was with the squandering of scores of dollars in\ncalling all men and hangers-on up to the bar to drink with me.\n\nBut how to get a girl? There was no girl's home to which Louis could take\nme and where I might be introduced to girls.  I knew none.  And Louis'\nseveral girls he wanted for himself; and anyway, in the very human nature\nof boys' and girls' ways, he couldn't turn any of them over to me.  He\ndid persuade them to bring girl-friends for me; but I found them weak\nsisters, pale and ineffectual alongside the choice specimens he had.\n\n\"You'll have to do like I did,\" he said finally.  \"I got these by getting\nthem.  You'll have to get one the same way.\"\n\nAnd he initiated me.  It must be remembered that Louis and I were hard\nsituated.  We really had to struggle to pay our board and maintain a\ndecent appearance.  We met each other in the evening, after the day's\nwork, on the street corner, or in a little candy store on a side street,\nour sole frequenting-place.  Here we bought our cigarettes, and,\noccasionally, a nickel's worth of \"red-hots.\" (Oh, yes; Louis and I\nunblushingly ate candy--all we could get.  Neither of us drank.  Neither\nof us ever went into a saloon.)\n\nBut the girl.  In quite primitive fashion, as Louis advised me, I was to\nselect her and make myself acquainted with her.  We strolled the streets\nin the early evenings.  The girls, like us, strolled in pairs.  And\nstrolling girls will look at strolling boys who look.  (And to this day,\nin any town, city, or village, in which I, in my middle age, find myself,\nI look on with the eye trained of old experience, and watch the sweet\ninnocent game played by the strolling boys and girls who just must stroll\nwhen the spring and summer evenings call.)\n\nThe trouble was that in this Arcadian phase of my history, I, who had\ncome through, case-hardened, from the other side of life, was timid and\nbashful.  Again and again Louis nerved me up.  But I didn't know girls.\nThey were strange and wonderful to me after my precocious man's life.  I\nfailed of the bold front and the necessary forwardness when the crucial\nmoment came.\n\nThen Louis would show me how--a certain, eloquent glance of eye, a smile,\na daring, a lifted hat, a spoken word, hesitancies, giggles, coy\nnervousnesses--and, behold, Louis acquainted and nodding me up to be\nintroduced.  But when we paired off to stroll along boy and girl\ntogether, I noted that Louis had invariably picked the good-looker and\nleft to me the little lame sister.\n\nI improved, of course, after experiences too numerous to enter upon, so\nthat there were divers girls to whom I could lift my hat and who would\nwalk beside me in the early evenings.  But girl's love did not\nimmediately come to me.  I was excited, interested, and I pursued the\nquest.  And the thought of drink never entered my mind.  Some of Louis'\nand my adventures have since given me serious pause when casting\nsociological generalisations.  But it was all good and innocently\nyouthful, and I learned one generalisation, biological rather than\nsociological, namely, that the \"Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady are\nsisters under their skins.\"\n\nAnd before long I learned girl's love, all the dear fond deliciousness of\nit, all the glory and the wonder.  I shall call her Haydee.  She was\nbetween fifteen and sixteen.  Her little skirt reached her shoe-tops.  We\nsat side by side in a Salvation Army meeting.  She was not a convert, nor\nwas her aunt who sat on the other side of her, and who, visiting from the\ncountry where at that time the Salvation Army was not, had dropped in to\nthe meeting for half an hour out of curiosity.  And Louis sat beside me\nand observed--I do believe he did no more than observe, because Haydee\nwas not his style of girl.\n\nWe did not speak, but in that great half-hour we glanced shyly at each\nother, and shyly avoided or as shyly returned and met each other's\nglances more than several times.  She had a slender oval face.  Her brown\neyes were beautiful.  Her nose was a dream, as was her sweet-lipped,\npetulant-hinting mouth.  She wore a tam-o'-shanter, and I thought her\nbrown hair the prettiest shade of brown I had ever seen.  And from that\nsingle experience of half an hour I have ever since been convinced of the\nreality of love at first sight.\n\nAll too soon the aunt and Haydee departed.  (This is permissible at any\nstage of a Salvation Army meeting.)  I was no longer interested in the\nmeeting, and, after an appropriate interval of a couple of minutes or\nless, started to leave with Louis.  As we passed out, at the back of the\nhall a woman recognised me with her eyes, arose, and followed me.  I\nshall not describe her.  She was of my own kind and friendship of the old\ntime on the water-front.  When Nelson was shot, he had died in her arms,\nand she knew me as his one comrade.  And she must tell me how Nelson had\ndied, and I did want to know; so I went with her across the width of life\nfrom dawning boy's love for a brown-haired girl in a tam-o'-shanter back\nto the old sad savagery I had known.\n\nAnd when I had heard the tale, I hurried away to find Louis, fearing that\nI had lost my first love with the first glimpse of her.  But Louis was\ndependable.  Her name was--Haydee.  He knew where she lived.  Each day\nshe passed the blacksmith's shop where he worked, going to or from the\nLafayette School.  Further, he had seen her on occasion with Ruth,\nanother schoolgirl, and, still further, Nita, who sold us red-hots at the\ncandy store, was a friend of Ruth.  The thing to do was to go around to\nthe candy store and see if we could get Nita to give a note to Ruth to\ngive to Haydee.  If this could be arranged, all I had to do was write the\nnote.\n\nAnd it so happened.  And in stolen half-hours of meeting I came to know\nall the sweet madness of boy's love and girl's love.  So far as it goes\nit is not the biggest love in the world, but I do dare to assert that it\nis the sweetest.  Oh, as I look back on it!  Never did girl have more\ninnocent boy-lover than I who had been so wicked-wise and violent beyond\nmy years.  I didn't know the first thing about girls.  I, who had been\nhailed Prince of the Oyster Pirates, who could go anywhere in the world\nas a man amongst men; who could sail boats, lay aloft in black and storm,\nor go into the toughest hang-outs in sailor town and play my part in any\nrough-house that started or call all hands to the bar--I didn't know the\nfirst thing I might say or do with this slender little chit of a\ngirl-woman whose scant skirt just reached her shoe-tops and who was as\nabysmally ignorant of life as I was, or thought I was, profoundly wise.\n\nI remember we sat on a bench in the starlight.  There was fully a foot of\nspace between us.  We slightly faced each other, our near elbows on the\nback of the bench; and once or twice our elbows just touched.  And all\nthe time, deliriously happy, talking in the gentlest and most delicate\nterms that might not offend her sensitive ears, I was cudgelling my\nbrains in an effort to divine what I was expected to do.  What did girls\nexpect of boys, sitting on a bench and tentatively striving to find out\nwhat love was?  What did she expect me to do? Was I expected to kiss her?\nDid she expect me to try? And if she did expect me, and I didn't what\nwould she think of me?\n\nAh, she was wiser than I--I know it now--the little innocent girl-woman\nin her shoe-top skirt.  She had known boys all her life.  She encouraged\nme in the ways a girl may.  Her gloves were off and in one hand, and I\nremember, lightly and daringly, in mock reproof for something I had said,\nhow she tapped my lips with a tiny flirt of those gloves.  I was like to\nswoon with delight.  It was the most wonderful thing that had ever\nhappened to me.  And I remember yet the faint scent that clung to those\ngloves and that I breathed in the moment they touched my lips.\n\nThen came the agony of apprehension and doubt.  Should I imprison in my\nhand that little hand with the dangling, scented gloves which had just\ntapped my lips? Should I dare to kiss her there and then, or slip my arm\naround her waist? Or dared I even sit closer?\n\nWell, I didn't dare.  I did nothing.  I merely continued to sit there and\nlove with all my soul.  And when we parted that evening I had not kissed\nher.  I do remember the first time I kissed her, on another evening, at\nparting--a mighty moment, when I took all my heart of courage and dared.\nWe never succeeded in managing more than a dozen stolen meetings, and we\nkissed perhaps a dozen times--as boys and girls kiss, briefly and\ninnocently, and wonderingly.  We never went anywhere--not even to a\nmatinee.  We once shared together five cents worth of red-hots.  But I\nhave always fondly believed that she loved me.  I know I loved her; and I\ndreamed day-dreams of her for a year and more, and the memory of her is\nvery dear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nWhen I was with people who did not drink, I never thought of drinking.\nLouis did not drink.  Neither he nor I could afford it; but, more\nsignificant than that, we had no desire to drink.  We were healthy,\nnormal, non-alcoholic.  Had we been alcoholic, we would have drunk\nwhether or not we could have afforded it.\n\nEach night, after the day's work, washed up, clothes changed, and supper\neaten, we met on the street corner or in the little candy store.  But the\nwarm fall weather passed, and on bitter nights of frost or damp nights of\ndrizzle, the street corner was not a comfortable meeting-place.  And the\ncandy store was unheated.  Nita, or whoever waited on the counter,\nbetween waitings lurked in a back living-room that was heated.  We were\nnot admitted to this room, and in the store it was as cold as\nout-of-doors.\n\nLouis and I debated the situation.  There was only one solution: the\nsaloon, the congregating-place of men, the place where men hobnobbed with\nJohn Barleycorn.  Well do I remember the damp and draughty evening,\nshivering without overcoats because we could not afford them, that Louis\nand I started out to select our saloon.  Saloons are always warm and\ncomfortable.  Now Louis and I did not go into this saloon because we\nwanted a drink.  Yet we knew that saloons were not charitable\ninstitutions.  A man could not make a lounging-place of a saloon without\noccasionally buying something over the bar.\n\nOur dimes and nickels were few.  We could ill spare any of them when they\nwere so potent in paying car-fare for oneself and a girl.  (We never paid\ncar-fare when by ourselves, being content to walk.)  So, in this saloon,\nwe desired to make the most of our expenditure.  We called for a deck of\ncards and sat down at a table and played euchre for an hour, in which\ntime Louis treated once, and I treated once, to beer--the cheapest drink,\nten cents for two.  Prodigal! How we grudged it!\n\nWe studied the men who came into the place.  They seemed all middle-aged\nand elderly work-men, most of them Germans, who flocked by themselves in\nold-acquaintance groups, and with whom we could have only the slightest\ncontacts.  We voted against that saloon, and went out cast down with the\nknowledge that we had lost an evening and wasted twenty cents for beer\nthat we didn't want.\n\nWe made several more tries on succeeding nights, and at last found our\nway into the National, a saloon on Tenth and Franklin.  Here was a more\ncongenial crowd.  Here Louis met a fellow or two he knew, and here I met\nfellows I had gone to school with when a little lad in knee pants.  We\ntalked of old days, and of what had become of this fellow, and what that\nfellow was doing now, and of course we talked it over drinks.  They\ntreated, and we drank.  Then, according to the code of drinking, we had\nto treat.  It hurt, for it meant forty to fifty cents a clatter.\n\nWe felt quite enlivened when the short evening was over; but at the same\ntime we were bankrupt.  Our week's spending money was gone.  We decided\nthat that was the saloon for us, and we agreed to be more circumspect\nthereafter in our drink-buying.  Also, we had to economise for the rest\nof the week.  We didn't even have car-fare.  We were compelled to break\nan engagement with two girls from West Oakland with whom we were\nattempting to be in love.  They were to meet us up town the next evening,\nand we hadn't the car-fare necessary to take them home.  Like many others\nfinancially embarrassed, we had to disappear for a time from the gay\nwhirl--at least until Saturday night pay-day.  So Louis and I\nrendezvoused in a livery stable, and with coats buttoned and chattering\nteeth played euchre and casino until the time of our exile was over.\n\nThen we returned to the National Saloon and spent no more than we could\ndecently avoid spending for the comfort and warmth.  Sometimes we had\nmishaps, as when one got stuck twice in succession in a five-handed game\nof Sancho Pedro for the drinks.  Such a disaster meant anywhere between\ntwenty-five to eighty cents, just according to how many of the players\nordered ten-cent drinks.  But we could temporarily escape the evil\neffects of such disaster, by virtue of an account we ran behind the bar.\nOf course, this only set back the day of reckoning and seduced us into\nspending more than we would have spent on a cash basis.  (When I left\nOakland suddenly for the adventure-path the following spring, I well\nremember I owed that saloon-keeper one dollar and seventy cents.  Long\nafter, when I returned, he was gone.  I still owe him that dollar and\nseventy cents, and if he should chance to read these lines I want him to\nknow that I'll pay on demand.)\n\nThe foregoing incident of the National Saloon I have given in order again\nto show the lure, or draw, or compulsion, toward John Barleycorn in\nsociety as at present organised with saloons on all the corners.  Louis\nand I were two healthy youths.  We didn't want to drink.  We couldn't\nafford to drink.  And yet we were driven by the circumstance of cold and\nrainy weather to seek refuge in a saloon, where we had to spend part of\nour pitiful dole for drink.  It will be urged by some critics that we\nmight have gone to the Y.M.C.A., to night school, and to the social\ncircles and homes of young people.  The only reply is that we didn't.\nThat is the irrefragable fact.  We didn't.  And to-day, at this moment,\nthere are hundreds of thousands of boys like Louis and me doing just what\nLouis and I did with John Barleycorn, warm and comfortable, beckoning and\nwelcoming, tucking their arms in his and beginning to teach them his\nmellow ways.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nThe jute mills failed of its agreement to increase my pay to a dollar and\na quarter a day, and I, a free-born American boy whose direct ancestors\nhad fought in all the wars from the old pre-Revolutionary Indian wars\ndown, exercised my sovereign right of free contract by quitting the job.\n\nI was still resolved to settle down, and I looked about me.  One thing\nwas clear.  Unskilled labour didn't pay.  I must learn a trade, and I\ndecided on electricity.  The need for electricians was constantly\ngrowing.  But how to become an electrician? I hadn't the money to go to a\ntechnical school or university; besides, I didn't think much of schools.\nI was a practical man in a practical world.  Also, I still believed in\nthe old myths which were the heritage of the American boy when I was a\nboy.\n\nA canal boy could become a President.  Any boy who took employment with\nany firm could, by thrift, energy, and sobriety, learn the business and\nrise from position to position until he was taken in as a junior partner.\nAfter that the senior partnership was only a matter of time.  Very\noften--so ran the myth--the boy, by reason of his steadiness and\napplication, married his employer's daughter.  By this time I had been\nencouraged to such faith in myself in the matter of girls that I was\nquite certain I would marry my employer's daughter.  There wasn't a doubt\nof it.  All the little boys in the myths did it as soon as they were old\nenough.\n\nSo I bade farewell for ever to the adventure-path, and went out to the\npower plant of one of our Oakland street railways.  I saw the\nsuperintendent himself, in a private office so fine that it almost\nstunned me.  But I talked straight up.  I told him I wanted to become a\npractical electrician, that I was unafraid of work, that I was used to\nhard work, and that all he had to do was look at me to see I was fit and\nstrong.  I told him that I wanted to begin right at the bottom and work\nup, that I wanted to devote my life to this one occupation and this one\nemployment.\n\nThe superintendent beamed as he listened.  He told me that I was the\nright stuff for success, and that he believed in encouraging American\nyouth that wanted to rise.  Why, employers were always on the lookout for\nyoung fellows like me, and alas, they found them all too rarely.  My\nambition was fine and worthy, and he would see to it that I got my\nchance.  (And as I listened with swelling heart, I wondered if it was his\ndaughter I was to marry.)\n\n\"Before you can go out on the road and learn the more complicated and\nhigher details of the profession,\" he said, \"you will, of course, have to\nwork in the car-house with the men who install and repair the motors.\n(By this time I was sure that it was his daughter, and I was wondering\nhow much stock he might own in the company.)\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"as you yourself so plainly see, you couldn't expect to\nbegin as a helper to the car-house electricians.  That will come when you\nhave worked up to it.  You will really begin at the bottom.  In the\ncar-house your first employment will be sweeping up, washing the windows,\nkeeping things clean.  And after you have shown yourself satisfactory at\nthat, then you may become a helper to the car-house electricians.\"\n\nI didn't see how sweeping and scrubbing a building was any preparation\nfor the trade of electrician; but I did know that in the books all the\nboys started with the most menial tasks and by making good ultimately won\nto the ownership of the whole concern.\n\n\"When shall I come to work?\" I asked, eager to launch on this dazzling\ncareer.\n\n\"But,\" said the superintendent, \"as you and I have already agreed, you\nmust begin at the bottom.  Not immediately can you in any capacity enter\nthe car-house.  Before that you must pass through the engine-room as an\noiler.\"\n\nMy heart went down slightly and for the moment as I saw the road lengthen\nbetween his daughter and me; then it rose again.  I would be a better\nelectrician with knowledge of steam engines.  As an oiler in the great\nengine-room I was confident that few things concerning steam would escape\nme.  Heavens! My career shone more dazzling than ever.\n\n\"When shall I come to work?\" I asked gratefully.\n\n\"But,\" said the superintendent, \"you could not expect to enter\nimmediately into the engine-room.  There must be preparation for that.\nAnd through the fire-room, of course.  Come, you see the matter clearly,\nI know.  And you will see that even the mere handling of coal is a\nscientific matter and not to be sneered at.  Do you know that we weigh\nevery pound of coal we burn? Thus, we learn the value of the coal we buy;\nwe know to a tee the last penny of cost of every item of production, and\nwe learn which firemen are the most wasteful, which firemen, out of\nstupidity or carelessness, get the least out of the coal they fire.\" The\nsuperintendent beamed again.  \"You see how very important the little\nmatter of coal is, and by as much as you learn of this little matter you\nwill become that much better a workman--more valuable to us, more\nvaluable to yourself.  Now, are you prepared to begin?\"\n\n\"Any time,\" I said valiantly.  \"The sooner the better.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered.  \"You will come to-morrow morning at seven\no'clock.\"\n\nI was taken out and shown my duties.  Also, I was told the terms of my\nemployment--a ten-hour day, every day in the month including Sundays and\nholidays, with one day off each month, with a salary of thirty dollars a\nmonth.  It wasn't exciting.  Years before, at the cannery, I had earned a\ndollar a day for a ten-hour day.  I consoled myself with the thought that\nthe reason my earning capacity had not increased with my years and\nstrength was because I had remained an unskilled labourer.  But it was\ndifferent now.  I was beginning to work for skill, for a trade, for\ncareer and fortune, and the superintendent's daughter.\n\nAnd I was beginning in the right way--right at the beginning.  That was\nthe thing.  I was passing coal to the firemen, who shovelled it into the\nfurnaces, where its energy was transformed into steam, which, in the\nengine-room, was transformed into the electricity with which the\nelectricians worked.  This passing coal was surely the very\nbeginning-unless the superintendent should take it into his head to send\nme to work in the mines from which the coal came in order to get a\ncompleter understanding of the genesis of electricity for street railways.\n\nWork! I, who had worked with men, found that I didn't know the first\nthing about real work.  A ten-hour day! I had to pass coal for the day\nand night shifts, and, despite working through the noon-hour, I never\nfinished my task before eight at night.  I was working a twelve-to\nthirteen-hour day, and I wasn't being paid overtime as in the cannery.\n\nI might as well give the secret away right here.  I was doing the work of\ntwo men.  Before me, one mature able-bodied labourer had done the day\nshift and another equally mature able-bodied labourer had done the\nnight-shift.  They had received forty dollars a month each.  The\nsuperintendent, bent on an economical administration, had persuaded me to\ndo the work of both men for thirty dollars a month.  I thought he was\nmaking an electrician of me.  In truth and fact, he was saving fifty\ndollars a month operating expenses to the company.\n\nBut I didn't know I was displacing two men.  Nobody told me.  On the\ncontrary, the superintendent warned everybody not to tell me.  How\nvaliantly I went at it that first day.  I worked at top speed, filling\nthe iron wheelbarrow with coal, running it on the scales and weighing the\nload, then trundling it into the fire-room and dumping it on the plates\nbefore the fires.\n\nWork! I did more than the two men whom I had displaced.  They had merely\nwheeled in the coal and dumped it on the plates.  But while I did this\nfor the day coal, the night coal I had to pile against the wall of the\nfire-room.  Now the fire-room was small.  It had been planned for a night\ncoal-passer.  So I had to pile the night coal higher and higher,\nbuttressing up the heap with stout planks.  Toward the top of the heap I\nhad to handle the coal a second time, tossing it up with a shovel.\n\nI dripped with sweat, but I never ceased from my stride, though I could\nfeel exhaustion coming on.  By ten o'clock in the morning, so much of my\nbody's energy had I consumed, I felt hungry and snatched a thick\ndouble-slice of bread and butter from my dinner pail.  This I devoured,\nstanding, grimed with coal-dust, my knees trembling under me.  By eleven\no'clock, in this fashion I had consumed my whole lunch.  But what of it?\nI realised that it would enable me to continue working through the noon\nhour.  And I worked all the afternoon.  Darkness came on, and I worked\nunder the electric lights.  The day fireman went off and the night\nfireman came on.  I plugged away.\n\nAt half-past eight, famished, tottering, I washed up, changed my clothes,\nand dragged my weary body to the car.  It was three miles to where I\nlived, and I had received a pass with the stipulation that I could sit\ndown as long as there were no paying passengers in need of a seat.  As I\nsank into a corner outside seat I prayed that no passenger might require\nmy seat.  But the car filled up, and, half-way in, a woman came on board,\nand there was no seat for her.  I started to get up, and to my\nastonishment found that I could not.  With the chill wind blowing on me,\nmy spent body had stiffened into the seat.  It took me the rest of the\nrun in to unkink my complaining joints and muscles and get into a\nstanding position on the lower step.  And when the car stopped at my\ncorner I nearly fell to the ground when I stepped off.\n\nI hobbled two blocks to the house and limped into the kitchen.  While my\nmother started to cook, I plunged into bread and butter; but before my\nappetite was appeased, or the steak fried, I was sound asleep.  In vain\nmy mother strove to shake me awake enough to eat the meat.  Failing in\nthis, with the assistance of my father she managed to get me to my room,\nwhere I collapsed dead asleep on the bed.  They undressed me and covered\nme up.  In the morning came the agony of being awakened.  I was terribly\nsore, and, worst of all, my wrists were swelling.  But I made up for my\nlost supper, eating an enormous breakfast, and when I hobbled to catch my\ncar I carried a lunch twice as big as the one the day before.\n\nWork! Let any youth just turned eighteen try to out-shovel two man-grown\ncoal-shovellers.  Work! Long before midday I had eaten the last scrap of\nmy huge lunch.  But I was resolved to show them what a husky young fellow\ndetermined to rise could do.  The worst of it was that my wrists were\nswelling and going back on me.  There are few who do not know the pain of\nwalking on a sprained ankle.  Then imagine the pain of shovelling coal\nand trundling a loaded wheelbarrow with two sprained wrists.\n\nWork! More than once I sank down on the coal where no one could see me,\nand cried with rage, and mortification, and exhaustion, and despair.\nThat second day was my hardest, and all that enabled me to survive it and\nget in the last of the night coal at the end of thirteen hours was the\nday fireman, who bound both my wrists with broad leather straps.  So\ntightly were they buckled that they were like slightly flexible plaster\ncasts.  They took the stresses and pressures which hitherto had been\nborne by my wrists, and they were so tight that there was no room for the\ninflammation to rise in the sprains.\n\nAnd in this fashion I continued to learn to be an electrician.  Night\nafter night I limped home, fell asleep before I could eat my supper, and\nwas helped into bed and undressed.  Morning after morning, always with\nhuger lunches in my dinner pail, I limped out of the house on my way to\nwork.\n\nI no longer read my library books.  I made no dates with the girls.  I\nwas a proper work beast.  I worked, and ate, and slept, while my mind\nslept all the time.  The whole thing was a nightmare.  I worked every\nday, including Sunday, and I looked far ahead to my one day off at the\nend of a month, resolved to lie abed all that day and just sleep and rest\nup.\n\nThe strangest part of this experience was that I never took a drink nor\nthought of taking a drink.  Yet I knew that men under hard pressure\nalmost invariably drank.  I had seen them do it, and in the past had\noften done it myself.  But so sheerly non-alcoholic was I that it never\nentered my mind that a drink might be good for me.  I instance this to\nshow how entirely lacking from my make-up was any predisposition toward\nalcohol.  And the point of this instance is that later on, after more\nyears had passed, contact with John Barleycorn at last did induce in me\nthe alcoholic desire.\n\nI had often noticed the day fireman staring at me in a curious way.  At\nlast, one day, he spoke.  He began by swearing me to secrecy.  He had\nbeen warned by the superintendent not to tell me, and in telling me he\nwas risking his job.  He told me of the day coal-passer and the night\ncoal-passer, and of the wages they had received.  I was doing for thirty\ndollars a month what they had received eighty dollars for doing.  He\nwould have told me sooner, the fireman said, had he not been so certain\nthat I would break down under the work and quit.  As it was, I was\nkilling myself, and all to no good purpose.  I was merely cheapening the\nprice of labour, he argued, and keeping two men out of a job.\n\nBeing an American boy, and a proud American boy, I did not immediately\nquit.  This was foolish of me, I know; but I resolved to continue the\nwork long enough to prove to the superintendent that I could do it\nwithout breaking down.  Then I would quit, and he would realise what a\nfine young fellow he had lost.\n\nAll of which I faithfully and foolishly did.  I worked on until the time\ncame when I got in the last of the night coal by six o'clock.  Then I\nquit the job of learning electricity by doing more than two men's work\nfor a boy's wages, went home, and proceeded to sleep the clock around.\n\nFortunately, I had not stayed by the job long enough to injure\nmyself--though I was compelled to wear straps on my wrists for a year\nafterward.  But the effect of this work orgy in which I had indulged was\nto sicken me with work.  I just wouldn't work.  The thought of work was\nrepulsive.  I didn't care if I never settled down.  Learning a trade\ncould go hang.  It was a whole lot better to royster and frolic over the\nworld in the way I had previously done.  So I headed out on the\nadventure-path again, starting to tramp East by beating my way on the\nrailroads.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nBut behold! As soon as I went out on the adventure-path I met John\nBarleycorn again.  I moved through a world of strangers, and the act of\ndrinking together made one acquainted with men and opened the way to\nadventures.  It might be in a saloon with jingled townsmen, or with a\ngenial railroad man well lighted up and armed with pocket flasks, or with\na bunch of alki stiffs in a hang-out.  Yes; and it might be in a\nprohibition state, such as Iowa was in 1894, when I wandered up the main\nstreet of Des Moines and was variously invited by strangers into various\nblind pigs--I remember drinking in barber-shops, plumbing establishments,\nand furniture stores.\n\nAlways it was John Barleycorn.  Even a tramp, in those halcyon days,\ncould get most frequently drunk.  I remember, inside the prison at\nBuffalo, how some of us got magnificently jingled, and how, on the\nstreets of Buffalo after our release, another jingle was financed with\npennies begged on the main-drag.\n\nI had no call for alcohol, but when I was with those who drank, I drank\nwith them.  I insisted on travelling or loafing with the livest, keenest\nmen, and it was just these live, keen ones that did most of the drinking.\nThey were the more comradely men, the more venturous, the more\nindividual.  Perhaps it was too much temperament that made them turn from\nthe commonplace and humdrum to find relief in the lying and fantastic\nsureties of John Barleycorn.  Be that as it may, the men I liked best,\ndesired most to be with, were invariably to be found in John Barleycorn's\ncompany.\n\nIn the course of my tramping over the United States I achieved a new\nconcept.  As a tramp, I was behind the scenes of society--aye, and down\nin the cellar.  I could watch the machinery work.  I saw the wheels of\nthe social machine go around, and I learned that the dignity of manual\nlabour wasn't what I had been told it was by the teachers, preachers, and\npoliticians.  The men without trades were helpless cattle.  If one\nlearned a trade, he was compelled to belong to a union in order to work\nat his trade.  And his union was compelled to bully and slug the\nemployers' unions in order to hold up wages or hold down hours.  The\nemployers' unions like-wise bullied and slugged.  I couldn't see any\ndignity at all.  And when a workman got old, or had an accident, he was\nthrown into the scrap-heap like any worn-out machine.  I saw too many of\nthis sort who were making anything but dignified ends of life.\n\nSo my new concept was that manual labour was undignified, and that it\ndidn't pay.  No trade for me, was my decision, and no superintendent's\ndaughters.  And no criminality, I also decided.  That would be almost as\ndisastrous as to be a labourer.  Brains paid, not brawn, and I resolved\nnever again to offer my muscles for sale in the brawn market.  Brain, and\nbrain only, would I sell.\n\nI returned to California with the firm intention of developing my brain.\nThis meant school education.  I had gone through the grammar school long\nago, so I entered the Oakland High School.  To pay my way I worked as a\njanitor.  My sister helped me, too; and I was not above mowing anybody's\nlawn or taking up and beating carpets when I had half a day to spare.  I\nwas working to get away from work, and I buckled down to it with a grim\nrealisation of the paradox.\n\nBoy and girl love was left behind, and, along with it, Haydee and Louis\nShattuck, and the early evening strolls.  I hadn't the time.  I joined\nthe Henry Clay Debating Society.  I was received into the homes of some\nof the members, where I met nice girls whose skirts reached the ground.\nI dallied with little home clubs wherein we discussed poetry and art and\nthe nuances of grammar.  I joined the socialist local where we studied\nand orated political economy, philosophy, and politics.  I kept half a\ndozen membership cards working in the free library and did an immense\namount of collateral reading.\n\nAnd for a year and a half on end I never took a drink, nor thought of\ntaking a drink.  I hadn't the time, and I certainly did not have the\ninclination.  Between my janitor-work, my studies, and innocent\namusements such as chess, I hadn't a moment to spare.  I was discovering\na new world, and such was the passion of my exploration that the old\nworld of John Barleycorn held no inducements for me.\n\nCome to think of it, I did enter a saloon.  I went to see Johnny Heinhold\nin the Last Chance, and I went to borrow money.  And right here is\nanother phase of John Barleycorn.  Saloon-keepers are notoriously good\nfellows.  On an average they perform vastly greater generosities than do\nbusiness men.  When I simply had to have ten dollars, desperate, with no\nplace to turn, I went to Johnny Heinhold.  Several years had passed since\nI had been in his place or spent a cent across his bar.  And when I went\nto borrow the ten dollars I didn't buy a drink, either.  And Johnny\nHeinhold let me have the ten dollars without security or interest.\n\nMore than once, in the brief days of my struggle for an education, I went\nto Johnny Heinhold to borrow money.  When I entered the university, I\nborrowed forty dollars from him, without interest, without security,\nwithout buying a drink.  And yet--and here is the point, the custom, and\nthe code--in the days of my prosperity, after the lapse of years, I have\ngone out of my way by many a long block to spend across Johnny Heinhold's\nbar deferred interest on the various loans.  Not that Johnny Heinhold\nasked me to do it, or expected me to do it.  I did it, as I have said, in\nobedience to the code I had learned along with all the other things\nconnected with John Barleycorn.  In distress, when a man has no other\nplace to turn, when he hasn't the slightest bit of security which a\nsavage-hearted pawn-broker would consider, he can go to some\nsaloon-keeper he knows.  Gratitude is inherently human.  When the man so\nhelped has money again, depend upon it that a portion will be spent\nacross the bar of the saloon-keeper who befriended him.\n\nWhy, I recollect the early days of my writing career, when the small sums\nof money I earned from the magazines came with tragic irregularity, while\nat the same time I was staggering along with a growing family--a wife,\nchildren, a mother, a nephew, and my Mammy Jennie and her old husband\nfallen on evil days.  There were two places at which I could borrow\nmoney; a barber shop and a saloon.  The barber charged me five per cent.\nper month in advance.  That is to say, when I borrowed one hundred\ndollars, he handed me ninety-five.  The other five dollars he retained as\nadvance interest for the first month.  And on the second month I paid him\nfive dollars more, and continued so to do each month until I made a ten\nstrike with the editors and lifted the loan.\n\nThe other place to which I came in trouble was the saloon.  This\nsaloon-keeper I had known by sight for a couple of years.  I had never\nspent my money in his saloon, and even when I borrowed from him I didn't\nspend any money.  Yet never did he refuse me any sum I asked of him.\nUnfortunately, before I became prosperous, he moved away to another city.\nAnd to this day I regret that he is gone.  It is the code I have learned.\nThe right thing to do, and the thing I'd do right now did I know where he\nis, would be to drop in on occasion and spend a few dollars across his\nbar for old sake's sake and gratitude.\n\nThis is not to exalt saloon-keepers.  I have written it to exalt the\npower of John Barleycorn and to illustrate one more of the myriad ways by\nwhich a man is brought in contact with John Barleycorn until in the end\nhe finds he cannot get along without him.\n\nBut to return to the run of my narrative.  Away from the adventure-path,\nup to my ears in study, every moment occupied, I lived oblivious to John\nBarleycorn's existence.  Nobody about me drank.  If any had drunk, and\nhad they offered it to me, I surely would have drunk.  As it was, when I\nhad spare moments I spent them playing chess, or going with nice girls\nwho were themselves students, or in riding a bicycle whenever I was\nfortunate enough to have it out of the pawnbroker's possession.\n\nWhat I am insisting upon all the time is this: in me was not the\nslightest trace of alcoholic desire, and this despite the long and severe\napprenticeship I had served under John Barleycorn.  I had come back from\nthe other side of life to be delighted with this Arcadian simplicity of\nstudent youths and student maidens.  Also, I had found my way into the\nrealm of the mind, and I was intellectually intoxicated.  (Alas! as I was\nto learn at a later period, intellectual intoxication too, has its\nkatzenjammer.)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nThree years was the time required to go through the high school.  I grew\nimpatient.  Also, my schooling was becoming financially impossible.  At\nsuch rate I could not last out, and I did greatly want to go to the state\nuniversity.  When I had done a year of high school, I decided to attempt\na short cut.  I borrowed the money and paid to enter the senior class of\na \"cramming joint\" or academy.  I was scheduled to graduate right into\nthe university at the end of four months, thus saving two years.\n\nAnd how I did cram! I had two years' new work to do in a third of a year.\nFor five weeks I crammed, until simultaneous quadratic equations and\nchemical formulas fairly oozed from my ears.  And then the master of the\nacademy took me aside.  He was very sorry, but he was compelled to give\nme back my tuition fee and to ask me to leave the school.  It wasn't a\nmatter of scholarship.  I stood well in my classes, and did he graduate\nme into the university he was confident that in that institution I would\ncontinue to stand well.  The trouble was that tongues were gossiping\nabout my case.  What! In four months accomplished two years' work! It\nwould be a scandal, and the universities were becoming severer in their\ntreatment of accredited prep schools.  He couldn't afford such a scandal,\ntherefore I must gracefully depart.\n\nI did.  And I paid back the borrowed money, and gritted my teeth, and\nstarted to cram by myself.  There were three months yet before the\nuniversity entrance examinations.  Without laboratories, without\ncoaching, sitting in my bedroom, I proceeded to compress that two years'\nwork into three months and to keep reviewed on the previous year's work.\n\nNineteen hours a day I studied.  For three months I kept this pace, only\nbreaking it on several occasions.  My body grew weary, my mind grew\nweary, but I stayed with it.  My eyes grew weary and began to twitch, but\nthey did not break down.  Perhaps, toward the last, I got a bit dotty.  I\nknow that at the time I was confident, I had discovered the formula for\nsquaring the circle; but I resolutely deferred the working of it out\nuntil after the examinations.  Then I would show them.\n\nCame the several days of the examinations, during which time I scarcely\nclosed my eyes in sleep, devoting every moment to cramming and reviewing.\nAnd when I turned in my last examination paper I was in full possession\nof a splendid case of brain-fag.  I didn't want to see a book.  I didn't\nwant to think or to lay eyes on anybody who was liable to think.\n\nThere was but one prescription for such a condition, and I gave it to\nmyself--the adventure-path.  I didn't wait to learn the result of my\nexaminations.  I stowed a roll of blankets and some cold food into a\nborrowed whitehall boat and set sail.  Out of the Oakland Estuary I\ndrifted on the last of an early morning ebb, caught the first of the\nflood up bay, and raced along with a spanking breeze.  San Pablo Bay was\nsmoking, and the Carquinez Straits off the Selby Smelter were smoking, as\nI picked up ahead and left astern the old landmarks I had first learned\nwith Nelson in the unreefer Reindeer.\n\nBenicia showed before me.  I opened the bight of Turner's Shipyard,\nrounded the Solano wharf, and surged along abreast of the patch of tules\nand the clustering fishermen's arks where in the old days I had lived and\ndrunk deep.\n\nAnd right here something happened to me, the gravity of which I never\ndreamed for many a long year to come.  I had had no intention of stopping\nat Benicia.  The tide favoured, the wind was fair and howling--glorious\nsailing for a sailor.  Bull Head and Army Points showed ahead, marking\nthe entrance to Suisun Bay which I knew was smoking.  And yet, when I\nlaid eyes on those fishing arks lying in the water-front tules, without\ndebate, on the instant, I put down my tiller, came in on the sheet, and\nheaded for the shore.  On the instant, out of the profound of my\nbrain-fag, I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to drink.  I wanted to get\ndrunk.\n\nThe call was imperative.  There was no uncertainty about it.  More than\nanything else in the world, my frayed and frazzled mind wanted surcease\nfrom weariness in the way it knew surcease would come.  And right here is\nthe point.  For the first time in my life I consciously, deliberately,\ndesired to get drunk.  It was a new, a totally different manifestation of\nJohn Barleycorn's power.  It was not a body need for alcohol.  It was a\nmental desire.  My over-worked and jaded mind wanted to forget.\n\nAnd here the point is drawn to its sharpest.  Granted my prodigious\nbrain-fag, nevertheless, had I never drunk in the past, the thought would\nnever have entered my mind to get drunk now.  Beginning with physical\nintolerance for alcohol, for years drinking only for the sake of\ncomradeship and because alcohol was everywhere on the adventure-path, I\nhad now reached the stage where my brain cried out, not merely for a\ndrink, but for a drunk.  And had I not been so long used to alcohol, my\nbrain would not have so cried out.  I should have sailed on past Bull\nHead, and in the smoking white of Suisun Bay, and in the wine of wind\nthat filled my sail and poured through me, I should have forgotten my\nweary brain and rested and refreshed it.\n\nSo I sailed in to shore, made all fast, and hurried up among the arks.\nCharley Le Grant fell on my neck.  His wife, Lizzie, folded me to her\ncapacious breast.  Billy Murphy, and Joe Lloyd, and all the survivors of\nthe old guard, got around me and their arms around me.  Charley seized\nthe can and started for Jorgensen's saloon across the railroad tracks.\nThat meant beer.  I wanted whisky, so I called after him to bring a flask.\n\nMany times that flask journeyed across the railroad tracks and back.\nMore old friends of the old free and easy times dropped in, fishermen,\nGreeks, and Russians, and French.  They took turns in treating, and\ntreated all around in turn again.  They came and went, but I stayed on\nand drank with all.  I guzzled.  I swilled.  I ran the liquor down and\njoyed as the maggots mounted in my brain.\n\nAnd Clam came in, Nelson's partner before me, handsome as ever, but more\nreckless, half insane, burning himself out with whisky.  He had just had\na quarrel with his partner on the sloop Gazelle, and knives had been\ndrawn, and blows struck, and he was bent on maddening the fever of the\nmemory with more whisky.  And while we downed it, we remembered Nelson\nand that he had stretched out his great shoulders for the last long sleep\nin this very town of Benicia; and we wept over the memory of him, and\nremembered only the good things of him, and sent out the flask to be\nfilled and drank again.\n\nThey wanted me to stay over, but through the open door I could see the\nbrave wind on the water, and my ears were filled with the roar of it.\nAnd while I forgot that I had plunged into the books nineteen hours a day\nfor three solid months, Charley Le Grant shifted my outfit into a big\nColumbia River salmon boat.  He added charcoal and a fisherman's brazier,\na coffee pot and frying pan, and the coffee and the meat, and a black\nbass fresh from the water that day.\n\nThey had to help me down the rickety wharf and into the salmon boat.\nLikewise they stretched my boom and sprit until the sail set like a\nboard.  Some feared to set the sprit; but I insisted, and Charley had no\ndoubts.  He knew me of old, and knew that I could sail as long as I could\nsee.  They cast off my painter.  I put the tiller up, filled away before\nit, and with dizzy eyes checked and steadied the boat on her course and\nwaved farewell.\n\nThe tide had turned, and the fierce ebb, running in the teeth of a\nfiercer wind, kicked up a stiff, upstanding sea.  Suisun Bay was white\nwith wrath and sea-lump.  But a salmon boat can sail, and I knew how to\nsail a salmon boat.  So I drove her into it, and through it, and across,\nand maundered aloud and chanted my disdain for all the books and schools.\nCresting seas filled me a foot or so with water, but I laughed at it\nsloshing about my feet, and chanted my disdain for the wind and the\nwater.  I hailed myself a master of life, riding on the back of the\nunleashed elements, and John Barleycorn rode with me.  Amid dissertations\non mathematics and philosophy and spoutings and quotations, I sang all\nthe old songs learned in the days when I went from the cannery to the\noyster boats to be a pirate--such songs as: \"Black Lulu,\" \"Flying Cloud,\"\n\"Treat my Daughter Kind-i-ly,\" \"The Boston Burglar,\" \"Come all you\nRambling, Gambling Men,\" \"I Wisht I was a Little Bird,\" \"Shenandoah,\" and\n\"Ranzo, Boys, Ranzo.\"\n\nHours afterward, in the fires of sunset, where the Sacramento and the San\nJoaquin tumble their muddy floods together, I took the New York Cut-Off,\nskimmed across the smooth land-locked water past Black Diamond, on into\nthe San Joaquin, and on to Antioch, where, somewhat sobered and\nmagnificently hungry, I laid alongside a big potato sloop that had a\nfamiliar rig.  Here were old friends aboard, who fried my black bass in\nolive oil.  Then, too, there was a meaty fisherman's stew, delicious with\ngarlic, and crusty Italian bread without butter, and all washed down with\npint mugs of thick and heady claret.\n\nMy salmon boat was a-soak, but in the snug cabin of the sloop dry\nblankets and a dry bunk were mine; and we lay and smoked and yarned of\nold days, while overhead the wind screamed through the rigging and taut\nhalyards drummed against the mast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nMy cruise in the salmon boat lasted a week, and I returned ready to enter\nthe university.  During the week's cruise I did not drink again.  To\naccomplish this I was compelled to avoid looking up old friends, for as\never the adventure-path was beset with John Barleycorn.  I had wanted the\ndrink that first day, and in the days that followed I did not want it.\nMy tired brain had recuperated.  I had no moral scruples in the matter.\nI was not ashamed nor sorry because of that first day's orgy at Benicia,\nand I thought no more about it, returning gladly to my books and studies.\n\nLong years were to pass ere I looked back upon that day and realised its\nsignificance.  At the time, and for a long time afterward, I was to think\nof it only as a frolic.  But still later, in the slough of brain-fag and\nintellectual weariness, I was to remember and know the craving for the\nanodyne that resides in alcohol.\n\nIn the meantime, after this one relapse at Benicia, I went on with my\nabstemiousness, primarily because I didn't want to drink.  And next, I\nwas abstemious because my way led among books and students where no\ndrinking was.  Had I been out on the adventure-path, I should as a matter\nof course have been drinking.  For that is the pity of the\nadventure-path, which is one of John Barleycorn's favourite stamping\ngrounds.\n\nI completed the first half of my freshman year, and in January of 1897\ntook up my courses for the second half.  But the pressure from lack of\nmoney, plus a conviction that the university was not giving me all that I\nwanted in the time I could spare for it, forced me to leave.  I was not\nvery disappointed.  For two years I had studied, and in those two years,\nwhat was far more valuable, I had done a prodigious amount of reading.\nThen, too, my grammar had improved.  It is true, I had not yet learned\nthat I must say \"It is I\"; but I no longer was guilty of a double\nnegative in writing, though still prone to that error in excited speech.\n\nI decided immediately to embark on my career.  I had four preferences:\nfirst, music; second, poetry; third, the writing of philosophic,\neconomic, and political essays; and, fourth, and last, and least, fiction\nwriting.  I resolutely cut out music as impossible, settled down in my\nbedroom, and tackled my second, third, and fourth choices simultaneously.\nHeavens, how I wrote!  Never was there a creative fever such as mine from\nwhich the patient escaped fatal results.  The way I worked was enough to\nsoften my brain and send me to a mad-house.  I wrote, I wrote\neverything--ponderous essays, scientific and sociological short stories,\nhumorous verse, verse of all sorts from triolets and sonnets to blank\nverse tragedy and elephantine epics in Spenserian stanzas.  On occasion I\ncomposed steadily, day after day, for fifteen hours a day.  At times I\nforgot to eat, or refused to tear myself away from my passionate\noutpouring in order to eat.\n\nAnd then there was the matter of typewriting.  My brother-in-law owned a\nmachine which he used in the day-time.  In the night I was free to use\nit.  That machine was a wonder.  I could weep now as I recollect my\nwrestlings with it.  It must have been a first model in the year one of\nthe typewriter era.  Its alphabet was all capitals.  It was informed with\nan evil spirit.  It obeyed no known laws of physics, and overthrew the\nhoary axiom that like things performed to like things produce like\nresults.  I'll swear that machine never did the same thing in the same\nway twice.  Again and again it demonstrated that unlike actions produce\nlike results.\n\nHow my back used to ache with it! Prior to that experience, my back had\nbeen good for every violent strain put upon it in a none too gentle\ncareer.  But that typewriter proved to me that I had a pipe-stem for a\nback.  Also, it made me doubt my shoulders.  They ached as with\nrheumatism after every bout.  The keys of that machine had to be hit so\nhard that to one outside the house it sounded like distant thunder or\nsome one breaking up the furniture.  I had to hit the keys so hard that I\nstrained my first fingers to the elbows, while the ends of my fingers\nwere blisters burst and blistered again.  Had it been my machine I'd have\noperated it with a carpenter's hammer.\n\nThe worst of it was that I was actually typing my manuscripts at the same\ntime I was trying to master that machine.  It was a feat of physical\nendurance and a brain storm combined to type a thousand words, and I was\ncomposing thousands of words every day which just had to be typed for the\nwaiting editors.\n\nOh, between the writing and the typewriting I was well a-weary.  I had\nbrain and nerve fag, and body fag as well, and yet the thought of drink\nnever suggested itself.  I was living too high to stand in need of an\nanodyne.  All my waking hours, except those with that infernal\ntypewriter, were spent in a creative heaven.  And along with this I had\nno desire for drink because I still believed in many things--in the love\nof all men and women in the matter of man and woman love; in fatherhood;\nin human justice; in art--in the whole host of fond illusions that keep\nthe world turning around.\n\nBut the waiting editors elected to keep on waiting.  My manuscripts made\namazing round-trip records between the Pacific and the Atlantic.  It\nmight have been the weirdness of the typewriting that prevented the\neditors from accepting at least one little offering of mine.  I don't\nknow, and goodness knows the stuff I wrote was as weird as its typing.  I\nsold my hard-bought school books for ridiculous sums to second-hand\nbookmen.  I borrowed small sums of money wherever I could, and suffered\nmy old father to feed me with the meagre returns of his failing strength.\n\nIt didn't last long, only a few weeks, when I had to surrender and go to\nwork.  Yet I was unaware of any need for the drink anodyne.  I was not\ndisappointed.  My career was retarded, that was all.  Perhaps I did need\nfurther preparation.  I had learned enough from the books to realise that\nI had only touched the hem of knowledge's garment.  I still lived on the\nheights.  My waking hours, and most of the hours I should have used for\nsleep, were spent with the books.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nOut in the country, at the Belmont Academy, I went to work in a small,\nperfectly appointed steam laundry.  Another fellow and myself did all the\nwork from sorting and washing to ironing the white shirts, collars and\ncuffs, and the \"fancy starch\" of the wives of the professors.  We worked\nlike tigers, especially as summer came on and the academy boys took to\nthe wearing of duck trousers.  It consumes a dreadful lot of time to iron\none pair of duck trousers.  And there were so many pairs of them.  We\nsweated our way through long sizzling weeks at a task that was never\ndone; and many a night, while the students snored in bed, my partner and\nI toiled on under the electric light at steam mangle or ironing board.\n\nThe hours were long, the work was arduous, despite the fact that we\nbecame past masters in the art of eliminating waste motion.  And I was\nreceiving thirty dollars a month and board--a slight increase over my\ncoal-shovelling and cannery days, at least to the extent of board, which\ncost my employer little (we ate in the kitchen), but which was to me the\nequivalent of twenty dollars a month.  My robuster strength of added\nyears, my increased skill, and all I had learned from the books, were\nresponsible for this increase of twenty dollars.  Judging by my rate of\ndevelopment, I might hope before I died to be a night watchman for sixty\ndollars a month, or a policeman actually receiving a hundred dollars with\npickings.\n\nSo relentlessly did my partner and I spring into our work throughout the\nweek that by Saturday night we were frazzled wrecks.  I found myself in\nthe old familiar work-beast condition, toiling longer hours than the\nhorses toiled, thinking scarcely more frequent thoughts than horses\nthink.  The books were closed to me.  I had brought a trunkful to the\nlaundry, but found myself unable to read them.  I fell asleep the moment\nI tried to read; and if I did manage to keep my eyes open for several\npages, I could not remember the contents of those pages.  I gave over\nattempts on heavy study, such as jurisprudence, political economy, and\nbiology, and tried lighter stuff, such as history.  I fell asleep.  I\ntried literature, and fell asleep.  And finally, when I fell asleep over\nlively novels, I gave up.  I never succeeded in reading one book in all\nthe time I spent in the laundry.\n\nAnd when Saturday night came, and the week's work was over until Monday\nmorning, I knew only one desire besides the desire to sleep, and that was\nto get drunk.  This was the second time in my life that I had heard the\nunmistakable call of John Barleycorn.  The first time it had been because\nof brain-fag.  But I had no over-worked brain now.  On the contrary, all\nI knew was the dull numbness of a brain that was not worked at all.  That\nwas the trouble.  My brain had become so alert and eager, so quickened by\nthe wonder of the new world the books had discovered to it, that it now\nsuffered all the misery of stagnancy and inaction.\n\nAnd I, the long time intimate of John Barleycorn, knew just what he\npromised me--maggots of fancy, dreams of power, forgetfulness, anything\nand everything save whirling washers, revolving mangles, humming\ncentrifugal wringers, and fancy starch and interminable processions of\nduck trousers moving in steam under my flying iron.  And that's it.  John\nBarleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and failure, to weariness and\nexhaustion.  He is the easy way out.  And he is lying all the time.  He\noffers false strength to the body, false elevation to the spirit, making\nthings seem what they are not and vastly fairer than what they are.\n\nBut it must not be forgotten that John Barleycorn is protean.  As well as\nto weakness and exhaustion, does he appeal to too much strength, to\nsuperabundant vitality, to the ennui of idleness.  He can tuck in his arm\nthe arm of any man in any mood.  He can throw the net of his lure over\nall men.  He exchanges new lamps for old, the spangles of illusion for\nthe drabs of reality, and in the end cheats all who traffic with him.\n\nI didn't get drunk, however, for the simple reason that it was a mile and\na half to the nearest saloon.  And this, in turn, was because the call to\nget drunk was not very loud in my ears.  Had it been loud, I would have\ntravelled ten times the distance to win to the saloon.  On the other\nhand, had the saloon been just around the corner, I should have got\ndrunk.  As it was, I would sprawl out in the shade on my one day of rest\nand dally with the Sunday papers.  But I was too weary even for their\nfroth.  The comic supplement might bring a pallid smile to my face, and\nthen I would fall asleep.\n\nAlthough I did not yield to John Barleycorn while working in the laundry,\na certain definite result was produced.  I had heard the call, felt the\ngnaw of desire, yearned for the anodyne.  I was being prepared for the\nstronger desire of later years.\n\nAnd the point is that this development of desire was entirely in my\nbrain.  My body did not cry out for alcohol.  As always, alcohol was\nrepulsive to my body.  When I was bodily weary from shovelling coal the\nthought of taking a drink had never flickered into my consciousness.\nWhen I was brain-wearied after taking the entrance examinations to the\nuniversity, I promptly got drunk.  At the laundry I was suffering\nphysical exhaustion again, and physical exhaustion that was not nearly so\nprofound as that of the coal-shovelling.  But there was a difference.\nWhen I went coal-shovelling my mind had not yet awakened.  Between that\ntime and the laundry my mind had found the kingdom of the mind.  While\nshovelling coal my mind was somnolent.  While toiling in the laundry my\nmind, informed and eager to do and be, was crucified.\n\nAnd whether I yielded to drink, as at Benicia, or whether I refrained, as\nat the laundry, in my brain the seeds of desire for alcohol were\ngerminating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nAfter the laundry my sister and her husband grubstaked me into the\nKlondike.  It was the first gold rush into that region, the early fall\nrush of 1897.  I was twenty-one years old, and in splendid physical\ncondition.  I remember, at the end of the twenty-eight-mile portage\nacross Chilcoot from Dyea Beach to Lake Linderman, I was packing up with\nthe Indians and out-packing many an Indian.  The last pack into Linderman\nwas three miles.  I back-tripped it four times a day, and on each forward\ntrip carried one hundred and fifty pounds.  This means that over the\nworst trails I daily travelled twenty-four miles, twelve of which were\nunder a burden of one hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nYes, I had let career go hang, and was on the adventure-path again in\nquest of fortune.  And of course, on the adventure-path, I met John\nBarleycorn.  Here were the chesty men again, rovers and adventurers, and\nwhile they didn't mind a grub famine, whisky they could not do without.\nWhisky went over the trail, while the flour lay cached and untouched by\nthe trail-side.\n\nAs good fortune would have it, the three men in my party were not\ndrinkers.  Therefore I didn't drink save on rare occasions and\ndisgracefully when with other men.  In my personal medicine chest was a\nquart of whisky.  I never drew the cork till six months afterward, in a\nlonely camp, where, without anaesthetics, a doctor was compelled to\noperate on a man.  The doctor and the patient emptied my bottle between\nthem and then proceeded to the operation.\n\nBack in California a year later, recovering from scurvy, I found that my\nfather was dead and that I was the head and the sole bread-winner of a\nhousehold.  When I state that I had passed coal on a steamship from\nBehring Sea to British Columbia, and travelled in the steerage from there\nto San Francisco, it will be understood that I brought nothing back from\nthe Klondike but my scurvy.\n\nTimes were hard.  Work of any sort was difficult to get.  And work of any\nsort was what I had to take, for I was still an unskilled labourer.  I\nhad no thought of career.  That was over and done with.  I had to find\nfood for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads--yes,\nand buy a winter suit, my one suit being decidedly summery.  I had to get\nsome sort of work immediately.  After that, when I had caught my breath,\nI might think about my future.\n\nUnskilled labour is the first to feel the slackness of hard times, and I\nhad no trades save those of sailor and laundryman.  With my new\nresponsibilities I didn't dare go to sea, and I failed to find a job at\nlaundrying.  I failed to find a job at anything.  I had my name down in\nfive employment bureaux.  I advertised in three newspapers.  I sought out\nthe few friends I knew who might be able to get me work; but they were\neither uninterested or unable to find anything for me.\n\nThe situation was desperate.  I pawned my watch, my bicycle, and a\nmackintosh of which my father had been very proud and which he had left\nto me.  It was and is my sole legacy in this world.  It had cost fifteen\ndollars, and the pawnbroker let me have two dollars on it.  And--oh,\nyes--a water-front comrade of earlier years drifted along one day with a\ndress suit wrapped in newspapers.  He could give no adequate explanation\nof how he had come to possess it, nor did I press for an explanation.  I\nwanted the suit myself.  No; not to wear.  I traded him a lot of rubbish\nwhich, being unpawnable, was useless to me.  He peddled the rubbish for\nseveral dollars, while I pledged the dress-suit with my pawnbroker for\nfive dollars.  And for all I know the pawnbroker still has the suit.  I\nhad never intended to redeem it.\n\nBut I couldn't get any work.  Yet I was a bargain in the labour market.\nI was twenty-two years old, weighed one hundred and sixty-five pounds\nstripped, every pound of which was excellent for toil; and the last\ntraces of my scurvy were vanishing before a treatment of potatoes chewed\nraw.  I tackled every opening for employment.  I tried to become a studio\nmodel, but there were too many fine-bodied young fellows out of jobs.  I\nanswered advertisements of elderly invalids in need of companions.  And I\nalmost became a sewing machine agent, on commission, without salary.  But\npoor people don't buy sewing machines in hard times, so I was forced to\nforgo that employment.\n\nOf course, it must be remembered that along with such frivolous\noccupations I was trying to get work as wop, lumper, and roustabout.  But\nwinter was coming on, and the surplus labour army was pouring into the\ncities.  Also I, who had romped along carelessly through the countries of\nthe world and the kingdom of the mind, was not a member of any union.\n\nI sought odd jobs.  I worked days, and half-days, at anything I could\nget.  I mowed lawns, trimmed hedges, took up carpets, beat them, and laid\nthem again.  Further, I took the civil service examinations for mail\ncarrier and passed first.  But alas! there was no vacancy, and I must\nwait.  And while I waited, and in between the odd jobs I managed to\nprocure, I started to earn ten dollars by writing a newspaper account of\na voyage I had made, in an open boat down the Yukon, of nineteen hundred\nmiles in nineteen days.  I didn't know the first thing about the\nnewspaper game, but I was confident I'd get ten dollars for my article.\n\nBut I didn't.  The first San Francisco newspaper to which I mailed it\nnever acknowledged receipt of the manuscript, but held on to it.  The\nlonger it held on to it the more certain I was that the thing was\naccepted.\n\nAnd here is the funny thing.  Some are born to fortune, and some have\nfortune thrust upon them.  But in my case I was clubbed into fortune, and\nbitter necessity wielded the club.  I had long since abandoned all\nthought of writing as a career.  My honest intention in writing that\narticle was to earn ten dollars.  And that was the limit of my intention.\nIt would help to tide me along until I got steady employment.  Had a\nvacancy occurred in the post office at that time, I should have jumped at\nit.\n\nBut the vacancy did not occur, nor did a steady job; and I employed the\ntime between odd jobs with writing a twenty-one-thousand-word serial for\nthe \"Youth's Companion.\"  I turned it out and typed it in seven days.  I\nfancy that was what was the matter with it, for it came back.\n\nIt took some time for it to go and come, and in the meantime I tried my\nhand at short stories.  I sold one to the \"Overland Monthly\" for five\ndollars.  The \"Black Cat\" gave me forty dollars for another.  The\n\"Overland Monthly\" offered me seven dollars and a half, pay on\npublication, for all the stories I should deliver.  I got my bicycle, my\nwatch, and my father's mackintosh out of pawn and rented a typewriter.\nAlso, I paid up the bills I owed to the several groceries that allowed me\na small credit.  I recall the Portuguese groceryman who never permitted\nmy bill to go beyond four dollars.  Hopkins, another grocer, could not be\nbudged beyond five dollars.\n\nAnd just then came the call from the post office to go to work.  It\nplaced me in a most trying predicament.  The sixty-five dollars I could\nearn regularly every month was a terrible temptation.  I couldn't decide\nwhat to do.  And I'll never be able to forgive the postmaster of Oakland.\nI answered the call, and I talked to him like a man.  I frankly told him\nthe situation.  It looked as if I might win out at writing.  The chance\nwas good, but not certain.  Now, if he would pass me by and select the\nnext man on the eligible list and give me a call at the next vacancy--\n\nBut he shut me off with: \"Then you don't want the position?\"\n\n\"But I do,\" I protested.  \"Don't you see, if you will pass me over this\ntime--\"\n\n\"If you want it you will take it,\" he said coldly.\n\nHappily for me, the cursed brutality of the man made me angry.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said.  \"I won't take it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nHaving burned my ship, I plunged into writing.  I am afraid I always was\nan extremist.  Early and late I was at it--writing, typing, studying\ngrammar, studying writing and all the forms of writing, and studying the\nwriters who succeeded in order to find out how they succeeded.  I managed\non five hours' sleep in the twenty-four, and came pretty close to working\nthe nineteen waking hours left to me.  My light burned till two and three\nin the morning, which led a good neighbour woman into a bit of\nsentimental Sherlock-Holmes deduction.  Never seeing me in the day-time,\nshe concluded that I was a gambler, and that the light in my window was\nplaced there by my mother to guide her erring son home.\n\nThe trouble with the beginner at the writing game is the long, dry\nspells, when there is never an editor's cheque and everything pawnable is\npawned.  I wore my summer suit pretty well through that winter, and the\nfollowing summer experienced the longest, dryest spell of all, in the\nperiod when salaried men are gone on vacation and manuscripts lie in\neditorial offices until vacation is over.\n\nMy difficulty was that I had no one to advise me.  I didn't know a soul\nwho had written or who had ever tried to write.  I didn't even know one\nreporter.  Also, to succeed at the writing game, I found I had to unlearn\nabout everything the teachers and professors of literature of the high\nschool and university had taught me.  I was very indignant about this at\nthe time; though now I can understand it.  They did not know the trick of\nsuccessful writing in the years 1895 and 1896.  They knew all about \"Snow\nBound\" and \"Sartor Resartus\"; but the American editors of 1899 did not\nwant such truck.  They wanted the 1899 truck, and offered to pay so well\nfor it that the teachers and professors of literature would have quit\ntheir jobs could they have supplied it.\n\nI struggled along, stood off the butcher and the grocer, pawned my watch\nand bicycle and my father's mackintosh, and I worked.  I really did work,\nand went on short commons of sleep.  Critics have complained about the\nswift education one of my characters, Martin Eden, achieved.  In three\nyears, from a sailor with a common school education, I made a successful\nwriter of him.  The critics say this is impossible.  Yet I was Martin\nEden.  At the end of three working years, two of which were spent in high\nschool and the university and one spent at writing, and all three in\nstudying immensely and intensely, I was publishing stories in magazines\nsuch as the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" was correcting proofs of my first book\n(issued by Houghton, Mifflin Co.), was selling sociological articles to\n\"Cosmopolitan\" and \"McClure's,\" had declined an associate editorship\nproffered me by telegraph from New York City, and was getting ready to\nmarry.\n\nNow the foregoing means work, especially the last year of it, when I was\nlearning my trade as a writer.  And in that year, running short on sleep\nand tasking my brain to its limit, I neither drank nor cared to drink.\nSo far as I was concerned, alcohol did not exist.  I did suffer from\nbrain-fag on occasion, but alcohol never suggested itself as an\nameliorative.  Heavens! Editorial acceptances and cheques were all the\namelioratives I needed.  A thin envelope from an editor in the morning's\nmail was more stimulating than half a dozen cocktails.  And if a cheque\nof decent amount came out of the envelope, such incident in itself was a\nwhole drunk.\n\nFurthermore, at that time in my life I did not know what a cocktail was.\nI remember, when my first book was published, several Alaskans, who were\nmembers of the Bohemian Club, entertained me one evening at the club in\nSan Francisco.  We sat in most wonderful leather chairs, and drinks were\nordered.  Never had I heard such an ordering of liqueurs and of highballs\nof particular brands of Scotch.  I didn't know what a liqueur or a\nhighball was, and I didn't know that \"Scotch\" meant whisky.  I knew only\npoor men's drinks, the drinks of the frontier and of sailor-town--cheap\nbeer and cheaper whisky that was just called whisky and nothing else.  I\nwas embarrassed to make a choice, and the steward nearly collapsed when I\nordered claret as an after-dinner drink.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nAs I succeeded with my writing, my standard of living rose and my horizon\nbroadened.  I confined myself to writing and typing a thousand words a\nday, including Sundays and holidays; and I still studied hard, but not so\nhard as formerly.  I allowed myself five and one-half hours of actual\nsleep.  I added this half-hour because I was compelled.  Financial\nsuccess permitted me more time for exercise.  I rode my wheel more,\nchiefly because it was permanently out of pawn; and I boxed and fenced,\nwalked on my hands, jumped high and broad, put the shot and tossed the\ncaber, and went swimming.  And I learned that more sleep is required for\nphysical exercise than for mental exercise.  There were tired nights,\nbodily, when I slept six hours; and on occasion of very severe exercise I\nactually slept seven hours.  But such sleep orgies were not frequent.\nThere was so much to learn, so much to be done, that I felt wicked when I\nslept seven hours.  And I blessed the man who invented alarm clocks.\n\nAnd still no desire to drink.  I possessed too many fine faiths, was\nliving at too keen a pitch.  I was a socialist, intent on saving the\nworld, and alcohol could not give me the fervours that were mine from my\nideas and ideals.  My voice, on account of my successful writing, had\nadded weight, or so I thought.  At any rate, my reputation as a writer\ndrew me audiences that my reputation as a speaker never could have drawn.\nI was invited before clubs and organisations of all sorts to deliver my\nmessage.  I fought the good fight, and went on studying and writing, and\nwas very busy.\n\nUp to this time I had had a very restricted circle of friends.  But now I\nbegan to go about.  I was invited out, especially to dinner, and I made\nmany friends and acquaintances whose economic lives were easier than mine\nhad been.  And many of them drank.  In their own houses they drank and\noffered me drink.  They were not drunkards any of them.  They just drank\ntemperately, and I drank temperately with them as an act of comradeship\nand accepted hospitality.  I did not care for it, neither wanted it nor\ndid not want it, and so small was the impression made by it that I do not\nremember my first cocktail nor my first Scotch highball.\n\nWell, I had a house.  When one is asked into other houses, he naturally\nasks others into his house.  Behold the rising standard of living.\nHaving been given drink in other houses, I could expect nothing else of\nmyself than to give drink in my own house.  So I laid in a supply of beer\nand whisky and table claret.  Never since that has my house not been well\nsupplied.\n\nAnd still, through all this period, I did not care in the slightest for\nJohn Barleycorn.  I drank when others drank, and with them, as a social\nact.  And I had so little choice in the matter that I drank whatever they\ndrank.  If they elected whisky, then whisky it was for me.  If they drank\nroot beer or sarsaparilla, I drank root beer or sarsaparilla with them.\nAnd when there were no friends in the house, why, I didn't drink\nanything.  Whisky decanters were always in the room where I wrote, and\nfor months and years I never knew what it was, when by myself, to take a\ndrink.\n\nWhen out at dinner I noticed the kindly, genial glow of the preliminary\ncocktail.  It seemed a very fitting and gracious thing.  Yet so little\ndid I stand in need of it, with my own high intensity and vitality, that\nI never thought it worth while to have a cocktail before my own meal when\nI ate alone.\n\nOn the other hand, I well remember a very brilliant man, somewhat older\nthan I, who occasionally visited me.  He liked whisky, and I recall\nsitting whole afternoons in my den, drinking steadily with him, drink for\ndrink, until he was mildly lighted up and I was slightly aware that I had\ndrunk some whisky.  Now why did I do this? I don't know, save that the\nold schooling held, the training of the old days and nights glass in hand\nwith men, the drinking ways of drink and drinkers.\n\nBesides, I no longer feared John Barleycorn.  Mine was that most\ndangerous stage when a man believes himself John Barleycorn's master.  I\nhad proved it to my satisfaction in the long years of work and study.  I\ncould drink when I wanted, refrain when I wanted, drink without getting\ndrunk, and to cap everything I was thoroughly conscious that I had no\nliking for the stuff.  During this period I drank precisely for the same\nreason I had drunk with Scotty and the harpooner and with the oyster\npirates--because it was an act that men performed with whom I wanted to\nbehave as a man.  These brilliant ones, these adventurers of the mind,\ndrank.  Very well.  There was no reason I should not drink with them--I\nwho knew so confidently that I had nothing to fear from John Barleycorn.\n\nAnd the foregoing was my attitude of mind for years.  Occasionally I got\nwell jingled, but such occasions were rare.  It interfered with my work,\nand I permitted nothing to interfere with my work.  I remember, when\nspending several months in the East End of London, during which time I\nwrote a book and adventured much amongst the worst of the slum classes,\nthat I got drunk several times and was mightily wroth with myself because\nit interfered with my writing.  Yet these very times were because I was\nout on the adventure-path where John Barleycorn is always to be found.\n\nThen, too, with the certitude of long training and unholy intimacy, there\nwere occasions when I engaged in drinking bouts with men.  Of course,\nthis was on the adventure-path in various parts of the world, and it was\na matter of pride.  It is a queer man-pride that leads one to drink with\nmen in order to show as strong a head as they.  But this queer man-pride\nis no theory.  It is a fact.\n\nFor instance, a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest\nof honour to a beer bust.  It is the only technical beer bust I ever\nattended.  I did not know the true inwardness of the affair when I\naccepted.  I imagined that the talk would be wild and high, that some of\nthem might drink more than they ought, and that I would drink discreetly.\nBut it seemed these beer busts were a diversion of these high-spirited\nyoung fellows whereby they whiled away the tedium of existence by making\nfools of their betters.  As I learned afterward, they had got their\nprevious guest of honour, a brilliant young radical, unskilled in\ndrinking, quite pipped.\n\nWhen I found myself with them, and the situation dawned on me, up rose my\nqueer man-pride.  I'd show them, the young rascals.  I'd show them who\nwas husky and chesty, who had the vitality and the constitution, the\nstomach and the head, who could make most of a swine of himself and show\nit least.  These unlicked cubs who thought they could out-drink ME!\n\nYou see, it was an endurance test, and no man likes to give another best.\nFaugh! it was steam beer.  I had learned more expensive brews.  Not for\nyears had I drunk steam beer; but when I had, I had drunk with men, and I\nguessed I could show these youngsters some ability in beer-guzzling.  And\nthe drinking began, and I had to drink with the best of them.  Some of\nthem might lag, but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag.\n\nAnd all my austere nights of midnight oil, all the books I had read, all\nthe wisdom I had gathered, went glimmering before the ape and tiger in me\nthat crawled up from the abysm of my heredity, atavistic, competitive and\nbrutal, lustful with strength and desire to outswine the swine.\n\nAnd when the session broke up I was still on my feet, and I walked,\nerect, unswaying--which was more than can be said of some of my hosts.  I\nrecall one of them in indignant tears on the street corner, weeping as he\npointed out my sober condition.  Little he dreamed the iron clutch, born\nof old training, with which I held to my consciousness in my swimming\nbrain, kept control of my muscles and my qualms, kept my voice unbroken\nand easy and my thoughts consecutive and logical.  Yes, and mixed up with\nit all I was privily a-grin.  They hadn't made a fool of me in that\ndrinking bout.  And I was proud of myself for the achievement.  Darn it,\nI am still proud, so strangely is man compounded.\n\nBut I didn't write my thousand words next morning.  I was sick, poisoned.\nIt was a day of wretchedness.  In the afternoon I had to give a public\nspeech.  I gave it, and I am confident it was as bad as I felt.  Some of\nmy hosts were there in the front rows to mark any signs on me of the\nnight before.  I don't know what signs they marked, but I marked signs on\nthem and took consolation in the knowledge that they were just as sick as\nI.\n\nNever again, I swore.  And I have never been inveigled into another beer\nbust.  For that matter, that was my last drinking bout of any sort.  Oh,\nI have drunk ever since, but with more wisdom, more discretion, and never\nin a competitive spirit.  It is thus that the seasoned drinker grows\nseasoned.\n\nTo show that at this period in my life drinking was wholly a matter of\ncompanionship, I remember crossing the Atlantic in the old Teutonic.  It\nchanced, at the start, that I chummed with an English cable operator and\na younger member of a Spanish shipping firm.  Now the only thing they\ndrank was \"horse's neck\"--a long, soft, cool drink with an apple peel or\nan orange peel floating in it.  And for that whole voyage I drank\nhorse's necks with my two companions.  On the other hand, had they drunk\nwhisky, I should have drunk whisky with them.  From this it must not be\nconcluded that I was merely weak.  I didn't care.  I had no morality in\nthe matter.  I was strong with youth, and unafraid, and alcohol was an\nutterly negligible question so far as I was concerned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nNot yet was I ready to tuck my arm in John Barleycorn's.  The older I\ngot, the greater my success, the more money I earned, the wider was the\ncommand of the world that became mine and the more prominently did John\nBarleycorn bulk in my life.  And still I maintained no more than a\nnodding acquaintance with him.  I drank for the sake of sociability, and\nwhen alone I did not drink.  Sometimes I got jingled, but I considered\nsuch jingles the mild price I paid for sociability.\n\nTo show how unripe I was for John Barleycorn, when, at this time, I\ndescended into my slough of despond, I never dreamed of turning to John\nBarleycorn for a helping hand.  I had life troubles and heart troubles\nwhich are neither here nor there in this narrative.  But, combined with\nthem, were intellectual troubles which are indeed germane.\n\nMine was no uncommon experience.  I had read too much positive science\nand lived too much positive life.  In the eagerness of youth I had made\nthe ancient mistake of pursuing Truth too relentlessly.  I had torn her\nveils from her, and the sight was too terrible for me to stand.  In\nbrief, I lost my fine faiths in pretty well everything except humanity,\nand the humanity I retained faith in was a very stark humanity indeed.\n\nThis long sickness of pessimism is too well known to most of us to be\ndetailed here.  Let it suffice to state that I had it very bad.  I\nmeditated suicide coolly, as a Greek philosopher might.  My regret was\nthat there were too many dependent directly upon me for food and shelter\nfor me to quit living.  But that was sheer morality.  What really saved\nme was the one remaining illusion--the PEOPLE.\n\nThe things I had fought for and burned my midnight oil for had failed me.\nSuccess--I despised it.  Recognition--it was dead ashes.  Society, men\nand women above the ruck and the muck of the water-front and the\nforecastle--I was appalled by their unlovely mental mediocrity.  Love of\nwoman--it was like all the rest.  Money--I could sleep in only one bed at\na time, and of what worth was an income of a hundred porterhouses a day\nwhen I could eat only one? Art, culture--in the face of the iron facts of\nbiology such things were ridiculous, the exponents of such things only\nthe more ridiculous.\n\nFrom the foregoing it can be seen how very sick I was.  I was born a\nfighter.  The things I had fought for had proved not worth the fight.\nRemained the PEOPLE.  My fight was finished, yet something was left still\nto fight for--the PEOPLE.\n\nBut while I was discovering this one last tie to bind me to life, in my\nextremity, in the depths of despond, walking in the valley of the shadow,\nmy ears were deaf to John Barleycorn.  Never the remotest whisper arose\nin my consciousness that John Barleycorn was the anodyne, that he could\nlie me along to live.  One way only was uppermost in my thought--my\nrevolver, the crashing eternal darkness of a bullet.  There was plenty of\nwhisky in the house--for my guests.  I never touched it.  I grew afraid\nof my revolver--afraid during the period in which the radiant, flashing\nvision of the PEOPLE was forming in my mind and will.  So obsessed was I\nwith the desire to die that I feared I might commit the act in my sleep,\nand I was compelled to give my revolver away to others who were to lose\nit for me where my subconscious hand might not find it.\n\nBut the PEOPLE saved me.  By the PEOPLE was I handcuffed to life.  There\nwas still one fight left in me, and here was the thing for which to\nfight.  I threw all precaution to the winds, threw myself with fiercer\nzeal into the fight for socialism, laughed at the editors and publishers\nwho warned me and who were the sources of my hundred porterhouses a day,\nand was brutally careless of whose feelings I hurt and of how savagely I\nhurt them.  As the \"well-balanced radicals\" charged at the time, my\nefforts were so strenuous, so unsafe and unsane, so ultra-revolutionary,\nthat I retarded the socialist development in the United States by five\nyears.  In passing, I wish to remark, at this late date, that it is my\nfond belief that I accelerated the socialist development in the United\nStates by at least five minutes.\n\nIt was the PEOPLE, and no thanks to John Barleycorn, who pulled me\nthrough my long sickness.  And when I was convalescent came the love of\nwoman to complete the cure and lull my pessimism asleep for many a long\nday, until John Barleycorn again awoke it.  But in the meantime, I\npursued Truth less relentlessly, refraining from tearing her last veils\naside even when I clutched them in my hand.  I no longer cared to look\nupon Truth naked.  I refused to permit myself to see a second time what I\nhad once seen.  And the memory of what I had that time seen I resolutely\nblotted from my mind.\n\nAnd I was very happy.  Life went well with me, I took delight in little\nthings.  The big things I declined to take too seriously.  I still read\nthe books, but not with the old eagerness.  I still read the books\nto-day, but never again shall I read them with that old glory of youthful\npassion when I harked to the call from over and beyond that whispered me\non to win to the mystery at the back of life and behind the stars.\n\nThe point of this chapter is that, in the long sickness that at some time\ncomes to most of us, I came through without any appeal for aid to John\nBarleycorn.  Love, socialism, the PEOPLE--healthful figments of man's\nmind--were the things that cured and saved me.  If ever a man was not a\nborn alcoholic, I believe that I am that man.  And yet--well, let the\nsucceeding chapters tell their tale, for in them will be shown how I paid\nfor my previous quarter of a century of contact with ever-accessible John\nBarleycorn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nAfter my long sickness my drinking continued to be convivial.  I drank\nwhen others drank and I was with them.  But, imperceptibly, my need for\nalcohol took form and began to grow.  It was not a body need.  I boxed,\nswam, sailed, rode horses, lived in the open an arrantly healthful life,\nand passed life insurance examinations with flying colours.  In its\ninception, now that I look back upon it, this need for alcohol was a\nmental need, a nerve need, a good-spirits need.  How can I explain?\n\nIt was something like this.  Physiologically, from the standpoint of\npalate and stomach, alcohol was, as it had always been, repulsive.  It\ntasted no better than beer did when I was five, than bitter claret did\nwhen I was seven.  When I was alone, writing or studying, I had no need\nfor it.  But--I was growing old, or wise, or both, or senile as an\nalternative.  When I was in company I was less pleased, less excited,\nwith the things said and done.  Erstwhile worth-while fun and stunts\nseemed no longer worth while; and it was a torment to listen to the\ninsipidities and stupidities of women, to the pompous, arrogant sayings\nof the little half-baked men.  It is the penalty one pays for reading the\nbooks too much, or for being oneself a fool.  In my case it does not\nmatter which was my trouble.  The trouble itself was the fact.  The\ncondition of the fact was mine.  For me the life, and light, and sparkle\nof human intercourse were dwindling.\n\nI had climbed too high among the stars, or, maybe, I had slept too hard.\nYet I was not hysterical nor in any way overwrought.  My pulse was\nnormal.  My heart was an amazement of excellence to the insurance\ndoctors.  My lungs threw the said doctors into ecstasies.  I wrote a\nthousand words every day.  I was punctiliously exact in dealing with all\nthe affairs of life that fell to my lot.  I exercised in joy and\ngladness.  I slept at night like a babe.  But--\n\nWell, as soon as I got out in the company of others I was driven to\nmelancholy and spiritual tears.  I could neither laugh with nor at the\nsolemn utterances of men I esteemed ponderous asses; nor could I laugh,\nnor engage in my old-time lightsome persiflage, with the silly\nsuperficial chatterings of women, who, underneath all their silliness and\nsoftness, were as primitive, direct, and deadly in their pursuit of\nbiological destiny as the monkeys women were before they shed their furry\ncoats and replaced them with the furs of other animals.\n\nAnd I was not pessimistic.  I swear I was not pessimistic.  I was merely\nbored.  I had seen the same show too often, listened too often to the\nsame songs and the same jokes.  I knew too much about the box office\nreceipts.  I knew the cogs of the machinery behind the scenes so well\nthat the posing on the stage, and the laughter and the song, could not\ndrown the creaking of the wheels behind.\n\nIt doesn't pay to go behind the scenes and see the angel-voiced tenor\nbeat his wife.  Well, I'd been behind, and I was paying for it.  Or else\nI was a fool.  It is immaterial which was my situation.  The situation is\nwhat counts, and the situation was that social intercourse for me was\ngetting painful and difficult.  On the other hand, it must be stated that\non rare occasions, on very rare occasions, I did meet rare souls, or\nfools like me, with whom I could spend magnificent hours among the stars,\nor in the paradise of fools.  I was married to a rare soul, or a fool,\nwho never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending\nsurprise and delight.  But I could not spend all my hours solely in her\ncompany.\n\nNor would it have been fair, nor wise, to compel her to spend all her\nhours in my company.  Besides, I had written a string of successful\nbooks, and society demands some portion of the recreative hours of a\nfellow that writes books.  And any normal man, of himself and his needs,\ndemands some hours of his fellow men.\n\nAnd now we begin to come to it.  How to face the social intercourse game\nwith the glamour gone? John Barleycorn.  The ever patient one had waited\na quarter of a century and more for me to reach my hand out in need of\nhim.  His thousand tricks had failed, thanks to my constitution and good\nluck, but he had more tricks in his bag.  A cocktail or two, or several,\nI found, cheered me up for the foolishness of foolish people.  A\ncocktail, or several, before dinner, enabled me to laugh whole-heartedly\nat things which had long since ceased being laughable.  The cocktail was\na prod, a spur, a kick, to my jaded mind and bored spirits.  It\nrecrudesced the laughter and the song, and put a lilt into my own\nimagination so that I could laugh and sing and say foolish things with\nthe liveliest of them, or platitudes with verve and intensity to the\nsatisfaction of the pompous mediocre ones who knew no other way to talk.\n\nA poor companion without a cocktail, I became a very good companion with\none.  I achieved a false exhilaration, drugged myself to merriment.  And\nthe thing began so imperceptibly that I, old intimate of John Barleycorn,\nnever dreamed whither it was leading me.  I was beginning to call for\nmusic and wine; soon I should be calling for madder music and more wine.\n\nIt was at this time I became aware of waiting with expectancy for the\npre-dinner cocktail.  I WANTED it, and I was CONSCIOUS that I wanted it.\nI remember, while war-corresponding in the Far East, of being\nirresistibly attracted to a certain home.  Besides accepting all\ninvitations to dinner, I made a point of dropping in almost every\nafternoon.  Now, the hostess was a charming woman, but it was not for her\nsake that I was under her roof so frequently.  It happened that she made\nby far the finest cocktail procurable in that large city where\ndrink-mixing on the part of the foreign population was indeed an art.  Up\nat the club, down at the hotels, and in other private houses, no such\ncocktails were created.  Her cocktails were subtle.  They were\nmasterpieces.  They were the least repulsive to the palate and carried\nthe most \"kick.\" And yet, I desired her cocktails only for sociability's\nsake, to key myself to sociable moods.  When I rode away from that city,\nacross hundreds of miles of rice-fields and mountains, and through months\nof campaigning, and on with the victorious Japanese into Manchuria, I did\nnot drink.  Several bottles of whisky were always to be found on the\nbacks of my pack-horses.  Yet I never broached a bottle for myself, never\ntook a drink by myself, and never knew a desire to take such a drink.\nOh, if a white man came into my camp, I opened a bottle and we drank\ntogether according to the way of men, just as he would open a bottle and\ndrink with me if I came into his camp.  I carried that whisky for social\npurposes, and I so charged it up in my expense account to the newspaper\nfor which I worked.\n\nOnly in retrospect can I mark the almost imperceptible growth of my\ndesire.  There were little hints then that I did not take, little straws\nin the wind that I did not see, little incidents the gravity of which I\ndid not realise.\n\nFor instance, for some years it had been my practice each winter to\ncruise for six or eight weeks on San Francisco Bay.  My stout sloop\nyacht, the Spray, had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove.  A Korean boy\ndid the cooking, and I usually took a friend or so along to share the\njoys of the cruise.  Also, I took my machine along and did my thousand\nwords a day.  On the particular trip I have in mind, Cloudesley and Toddy\ncame along.  This was Toddy's first trip.  On previous trips Cloudesley\nhad elected to drink beer; so I had kept the yacht supplied with beer and\nhad drunk beer with him.\n\nBut on this cruise the situation was different.  Toddy was so nicknamed\nbecause of his diabolical cleverness in concocting toddies.  So I brought\nwhisky along--a couple of gallons.  Alas!  Many another gallon I bought,\nfor Cloudesley and I got into the habit of drinking a certain hot toddy\nthat actually tasted delicious going down and that carried the most\nexhilarating kick imaginable.\n\nI liked those toddies.  I grew to look forward to the making of them.  We\ndrank them regularly, one before breakfast, one before dinner, one before\nsupper, and a final one when we went to bed.  We never got drunk.  But I\nwill say that four times a day we were very genial.  And when, in the\nmiddle of the cruise, Toddy was called back to San Francisco on business,\nCloudesley and I saw to it that the Korean boy mixed toddies regularly\nfor us according to formula.\n\nBut that was only on the boat.  Back on the land, in my house, I took no\nbefore breakfast eye-opener, no bed-going nightcap.  And I haven't drunk\nhot toddies since, and that was many a year ago.  But the point is, I\nLIKED those toddies.  The geniality of which they were provocative was\nmarvellous.  They were eloquent proselyters for John Barleycorn in their\nown small insidious way.  They were tickles of the something destined to\ngrow into daily and deadly desire.  And I didn't know, never dreamed--I,\nwho had lived with John Barleycorn for so many years and laughed at all\nhis unavailing attempts to win me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nPart of the process of recovering from my long sickness was to find\ndelight in little things, in things unconnected with books and problems,\nin play, in games of tag in the swimming pool, in flying kites, in\nfooling with horses, in working out mechanical puzzles.  As a result, I\ngrew tired of the city.  On the ranch, in the Valley of the Moon, I found\nmy paradise.  I gave up living in cities.  All the cities held for me\nwere music, the theatre, and Turkish baths.\n\nAnd all went well with me.  I worked hard, played hard, and was very\nhappy.  I read more fiction and less fact.  I did not study a tithe as\nmuch as I had studied in the past.  I still took an interest in the\nfundamental problems of existence, but it was a very cautious interest;\nfor I had burned my fingers that time I clutched at the veils of Truth\nand wrested them from her.  There was a bit of lie in this attitude of\nmine, a bit of hypocrisy; but the lie and the hypocrisy were those of a\nman desiring to live.  I deliberately blinded myself to what I took to be\nthe savage interpretation of biological fact.  After all, I was merely\nforswearing a bad habit, forgoing a bad frame of mind.  And I repeat, I\nwas very happy.  And I add, that in all my days, measuring them with\ncold, considerative judgment, this was, far and away beyond all other\nperiods, the happiest period of my life.\n\nBut the time was at hand, rhymeless and reasonless so far as I can see,\nwhen I was to begin to pay for my score of years of dallying with John\nBarleycorn.  Occasionally guests journeyed to the ranch and remained a\nfew days.  Some did not drink.  But to those who did drink, the absence\nof all alcohol on the ranch was a hardship.  I could not violate my sense\nof hospitality by compelling them to endure this hardship.  I ordered in\na stock--for my guests.\n\nI was never interested enough in cocktails to know how they were made.\nSo I got a bar-keeper in Oakland to make them in bulk and ship them to\nme.  When I had no guests I didn't drink.  But I began to notice, when I\nfinished my morning's work, that I was glad if there were a guest, for\nthen I could drink a cocktail with him.\n\nNow I was so clean of alcohol that even a single cocktail was provocative\nof pitch.  A single cocktail would glow the mind and tickle a laugh for\nthe few minutes prior to sitting down to table and starting the\ndelightful process of eating.  On the other hand, such was the strength\nof my stomach, of my alcoholic resistance, that the single cocktail was\nonly the glimmer of a glow, the faintest tickle of a laugh.  One day, a\nfriend frankly and shamelessly suggested a second cocktail.  I drank the\nsecond one with him.  The glow was appreciably longer and warmer, the\nlaughter deeper and more resonant.  One does not forget such experiences.\nSometimes I almost think that it was because I was so very happy that I\nstarted on my real drinking.\n\nI remember one day Charmian and I took a long ride over the mountains on\nour horses.  The servants had been dismissed for the day, and we returned\nlate at night to a jolly chafing-dish supper.  Oh, it was good to be\nalive that night while the supper was preparing, the two of us alone in\nthe kitchen.  I, personally, was at the top of life.  Such things as the\nbooks and ultimate truth did not exist.  My body was gloriously healthy,\nand healthily tired from the long ride.  It had been a splendid day.  The\nnight was splendid.  I was with the woman who was my mate, picnicking in\ngleeful abandon.  I had no troubles.  The bills were all paid, and a\nsurplus of money was rolling in on me.  The future ever-widened before\nme.  And right there, in the kitchen, delicious things bubbled in the\nchafing-dish, our laughter bubbled, and my stomach was keen with a most\ndelicious edge of appetite.\n\nI felt so good, that somehow, somewhere, in me arose an insatiable greed\nto feel better.  I was so happy that I wanted to pitch my happiness even\nhigher.  And I knew the way.  Ten thousand contacts with John Barleycorn\nhad taught me.  Several times I wandered out of the kitchen to the\ncocktail bottle, and each time I left it diminished by one man's size\ncocktail.  The result was splendid.  I wasn't jingled, I wasn't lighted\nup; but I was warmed, I glowed, my happiness was pyramided.  Munificent\nas life was to me, I added to that munificence.  It was a great hour--one\nof my greatest.  But I paid for it, long afterwards, as you will see.\nOne does not forget such experiences, and, in human stupidity, cannot be\nbrought to realise that there is no immutable law which decrees that same\nthings shall produce same results.  For they don't, else would the\nthousandth pipe of opium be provocative of similar delights to the first,\nelse would one cocktail, instead of several, produce an equivalent glow\nafter a year of cocktails.\n\nOne day, just before I ate midday dinner, after my morning's writing was\ndone, when I had no guest, I took a cocktail by myself.  Thereafter, when\nthere were no guests, I took this daily pre-dinner cocktail.  And right\nthere John Barleycorn had me.  I was beginning to drink regularly.  I was\nbeginning to drink alone.  And I was beginning to drink, not for\nhospitality's sake, not for the sake of the taste, but for the effect of\nthe drink.\n\nI WANTED that daily pre-dinner cocktail.  And it never crossed my mind\nthat there was any reason I should not have it.  I paid for it.  I could\npay for a thousand cocktails each day if I wanted.  And what was a\ncocktail--one cocktail--to me who on so many occasions for so many years\nhad drunk inordinate quantities of stiffer stuff and been unharmed?\n\nThe programme of my ranch life was as follows: Each morning, at\neight-thirty, having been reading or correcting proofs in bed since four\nor five, I went to my desk.  Odds and ends of correspondence and notes\noccupied me till nine, and at nine sharp, invariably, I began my writing.\nBy eleven, sometimes a few minutes earlier or later, my thousand words\nwere finished.  Another half-hour at cleaning up my desk, and my day's\nwork was done, so that at eleven-thirty I got into a hammock under the\ntrees with my mail-bag and the morning newspaper.  At twelve-thirty I ate\ndinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode.\n\nOne morning, at eleven-thirty, before I got into the hammock, I took a\ncocktail.  I repeated this on subsequent mornings, of course, taking\nanother cocktail just before I ate at twelve-thirty.  Soon I found\nmyself, seated at my desk in the midst of my thousand words, looking\nforward to that eleven-thirty cocktail.\n\nAt last, now, I was thoroughly conscious that I desired alcohol.  But\nwhat of it? I wasn't afraid of John Barleycorn.  I had associated with\nhim too long.  I was wise in the matter of drink.  I was discreet.  Never\nagain would I drink to excess.  I knew the dangers and the pitfalls of\nJohn Barleycorn, the various ways by which he had tried to kill me in the\npast.  But all that was past, long past.  Never again would I drink\nmyself to stupefaction.  Never again would I get drunk.  All I wanted,\nand all I would take, was just enough to glow and warm me, to kick\ngeniality alive in me and put laughter in my throat and stir the maggots\nof imagination slightly in my brain.  Oh, I was thoroughly master of\nmyself, and of John Barleycorn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nBut the same stimulus to the human organism will not continue to produce\nthe same response.  By and by I discovered there was no kick at all in\none cocktail.  One cocktail left me dead.  There was no glow, no laughter\ntickle.  Two or three cocktails were required to produce the original\neffect of one.  And I wanted that effect.  I drank my first cocktail at\neleven-thirty when I took the morning's mail into the hammock, and I\ndrank my second cocktail an hour later just before I ate.  I got into the\nhabit of crawling out of the hammock ten minutes earlier so as to find\ntime and decency for two more cocktails ere I ate.  This became\nschedule--three cocktails in the hour that intervened between my desk and\ndinner.  And these are two of the deadliest drinking habits: regular\ndrinking and solitary drinking.\n\nI was always willing to drink when any one was around.  I drank by myself\nwhen no one was around.  Then I made another step.  When I had for guest\na man of limited drinking calibre, I took two drinks to his one--one\ndrink with him, the other drink without him and of which he did not know.\nI STOLE that other drink, and, worse than that, I began the habit of\ndrinking alone when there was a guest, a man, a comrade, with whom I\ncould have drunk.  But John Barleycorn furnished the extenuation.  It was\na wrong thing to trip a guest up with excess of hospitality and get him\ndrunk.  If I persuaded him, with his limited calibre, into drinking up\nwith me, I'd surely get him drunk.  What could I do but steal that every\nsecond drink, or else deny myself the kick equivalent to what he got out\nof half the number?\n\nPlease remember, as I recite this development of my drinking, that I am\nno fool, no weakling.  As the world measures such things, I am a\nsuccess--I dare to say a success more conspicuous than the success of the\naverage successful man, and a success that required a pretty fair amount\nof brains and will power.  My body is a strong body.  It has survived\nwhere weaklings died like flies.  And yet these things which I am\nrelating happened to my body and to me.  I am a fact.  My drinking is a\nfact.  My drinking is a thing that has happened, and is no theory nor\nspeculation; and, as I see it, it but lays the emphasis on the power of\nJohn Barleycorn--a savagery that we still permit to exist, a deadly\ninstitution that lingers from the mad old brutal days and that takes its\nheavy toll of youth and strength, and high spirit, and of very much of\nall of the best we breed.\n\nTo return.  After a boisterous afternoon in the swimming pool, followed\nby a glorious ride on horseback over the mountains or up or down the\nValley of the Moon, I found myself so keyed and splendid that I desired\nto be more highly keyed, to feel more splendid.  I knew the way.  A\ncocktail before supper was not the way.  Two or three, at the very least,\nwas what was needed.  I took them.  Why not? It was living.  I had always\ndearly loved to live.  This also became part of the daily schedule.\n\nThen, too, I was perpetually finding excuses for extra cocktails.  It\nmight be the assembling of a particularly jolly crowd; a touch of anger\nagainst my architect or against a thieving stone-mason working on my\nbarn; the death of my favourite horse in a barbed wire fence; or news of\ngood fortune in the morning mail from my dealings with editors and\npublishers.  It was immaterial what the excuse might be, once the desire\nhad germinated in me.  The thing was: I WANTED alcohol.  At last, after a\nscore and more of years of dallying and of not wanting, now I wanted it.\nAnd my strength was my weakness.  I required two, three, or four drinks\nto get an effect commensurate with the effect the average man got out of\none drink.\n\nOne rule I observed.  I never took a drink until my day's work of writing\na thousand words was done.  And, when done, the cocktails reared a wall\nof inhibition in my brain between the day's work done and the rest of the\nday of fun to come.  My work ceased from my consciousness.  No thought of\nit flickered in my brain till next morning at nine o'clock when I sat at\nmy desk and began my next thousand words.  This was a desirable condition\nof mind to achieve.  I conserved my energy by means of this alcoholic\ninhibition.  John Barleycorn was not so black as he was painted.  He did\na fellow many a good turn, and this was one of them.\n\nAnd I turned out work that was healthful, and wholesome, and sincere.  It\nwas never pessimistic.  The way to life I had learned in my long\nsickness.  I knew the illusions were right, and I exalted the illusions.\nOh, I still turn out the same sort of work, stuff that is clean, alive,\noptimistic, and that makes toward life.  And I am always assured by the\ncritics of my super-abundant and abounding vitality, and of how\nthoroughly I am deluded by these very illusions I exploit.\n\nAnd while on this digression, let me repeat the question I have repeated\nto myself ten thousand times.  WHY DID I DRINK?  What need was there for\nit? I was happy.  Was it because I was too happy? I was strong.  Was it\nbecause I was too strong? Did I possess too much vitality? I don't know\nwhy I drank.  I cannot answer, though I can voice the suspicion that ever\ngrows in me.  I had been in too-familiar contact with John Barleycorn\nthrough too many years.  A left-handed man, by long practice, can become\na right-handed man.  Had I, a non-alcoholic, by long practice become an\nalcoholic?\n\nI was so happy.  I had won through my long sickness to the satisfying\nlove of woman.  I earned more money with less endeavour.  I glowed with\nhealth.  I slept like a babe.  I continued to write successful books, and\nin sociological controversy I saw my opponents confuted with the facts of\nthe times that daily reared new buttresses to my intellectual position.\nFrom day's end to day's end I never knew sorrow, disappointment, nor\nregret.  I was happy all the time.  Life was one unending song.  I\nbegrudged the very hours of blessed sleep because by that much was I\nrobbed of the joy that would have been mine had I remained awake.  And\nyet I drank.  And John Barleycorn, all unguessed by me, was setting the\nstage for a sickness all his own.\n\nThe more I drank the more I was required to drink to get an equivalent\neffect.  When I left the Valley of the Moon, and went to the city, and\ndined out, a cocktail served at table was a wan and worthless thing.\nThere was no pre-dinner kick in it.  On my way to dinner I was compelled\nto accumulate the kick--two cocktails, three, and, if I met some fellows,\nfour or five, or six, it didn't matter within several.  Once, I was in a\nrush.  I had no time decently to accumulate the several drinks.  A\nbrilliant idea came to me.  I told the barkeeper to mix me a double\ncocktail.  Thereafter, whenever I was in a hurry, I ordered double\ncocktails.  It saved time.\n\nOne result of this regular heavy drinking was to jade me.  My mind grew\nso accustomed to spring and liven by artificial means that without\nartificial means it refused to spring and liven.  Alcohol became more and\nmore imperative in order to meet people, in order to become sociably fit.\nI had to get the kick and the hit of the stuff, the crawl of the maggots,\nthe genial brain glow, the laughter tickle, the touch of devilishness and\nsting, the smile over the face of things, ere I could join my fellows and\nmake one with them.\n\nAnother result was that John Barleycorn was beginning to trip me up.  He\nwas thrusting my long sickness back upon me, inveigling me into again\npursuing Truth and snatching her veils away from her, tricking me into\nlooking reality stark in the face.  But this came on gradually.  My\nthoughts were growing harsh again, though they grew harsh slowly.\n\nSometimes warning thoughts crossed my mind.  Where was this steady\ndrinking leading? But trust John Barleycorn to silence such questions.\n\"Come on and have a drink and I'll tell you all about it,\" is his way.\nAnd it works.  For instance, the following is a case in point, and one\nwhich John Barleycorn never wearied of reminding me:\n\nI had suffered an accident which required a ticklish operation.  One\nmorning, a week after I had come off the table, I lay on my hospital bed,\nweak and weary.  The sunburn of my face, what little of it could be seen\nthrough a scraggly growth of beard, had faded to a sickly yellow.  My\ndoctor stood at my bedside on the verge of departure.  He glared\ndisapprovingly at the cigarette I was smoking.\n\n\"That's what you ought to quit,\" he lectured.  \"It will get you in the\nend.  Look at me.\"\n\nI looked.  He was about my own age, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, eyes\nsparkling, and ruddy-cheeked with health.  A finer specimen of manhood\none would not ask.\n\n\"I used to smoke,\" he went on.  \"Cigars.  But I gave even them up.  And\nlook at me.\"\n\nThe man was arrogant, and rightly arrogant, with conscious well-being.\nAnd within a month he was dead.  It was no accident.  Half a dozen\ndifferent bugs of long scientific names had attacked and destroyed him.\nThe complications were astonishing and painful, and for days before he\ndied the screams of agony of that splendid manhood could be heard for a\nblock around.  He died screaming.\n\n\"You see,\" said John Barleycorn.  \"He took care of himself.  He even\nstopped smoking cigars.  And that's what he got for it.  Pretty rotten,\neh? But the bugs will jump.  There's no forefending them.  Your\nmagnificent doctor took every precaution, yet they got him.  When the bug\njumps you can't tell where it will land.  It may be you.  Look what he\nmissed.  Will you miss all I can give you, only to have a bug jump on you\nand drag you down? There is no equity in life.  It's all a lottery.  But\nI put the lying smile on the face of life and laugh at the facts.  Smile\nwith me and laugh.  You'll get yours in the end, but in the meantime\nlaugh.  It's a pretty dark world.  I illuminate it for you.  It's a\nrotten world, when things can happen such as happened to your doctor.\nThere's only one thing to do: take another drink and forget it.\"\n\nAnd, of course, I took another drink for the inhibition that accompanied\nit.  I took another drink every time John Barleycorn reminded me of what\nhad happened.  Yet I drank rationally, intelligently.  I saw to it that\nthe quality of the stuff was of the best.  I sought the kick and the\ninhibition, and avoided the penalties of poor quality and of drunkenness.\nIt is to be remarked, in passing, that when a man begins to drink\nrationally and intelligently that he betrays a grave symptom of how far\nalong the road he has travelled.\n\nBut I continued to observe my rule of never taking my first drink of the\nday until the last word of my thousand words was written.  On occasion,\nhowever, I took a day's vacation from my writing.  At such times, since\nit was no violation of my rule, I didn't mind how early in the day I took\nthat first drink.  And persons who have never been through the drinking\ngame wonder how the drinking habit grows!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nWhen the Snark sailed on her long cruise from San Francisco there was\nnothing to drink on board.  Or, rather, we were all of us unaware that\nthere was anything to drink, nor did we discover it for many a month.\nThis sailing with a \"dry\" boat was malice aforethought on my part.  I had\nplayed John Barleycorn a trick.  And it showed that I was listening ever\nso slightly to the faint warnings that were beginning to arise in my\nconsciousness.\n\nOf course, I veiled the situation to myself and excused myself to John\nBarleycorn.  And I was very scientific about it.  I said that I would\ndrink only while in ports.  During the dry sea-stretches my system would\nbe cleansed of the alcohol that soaked it, so that when I reached a port\nI should be in shape to enjoy John Barleycorn more thoroughly.  His bite\nwould be sharper, his kick keener and more delicious.\n\nWe were twenty-seven days on the traverse between San Francisco and\nHonolulu.  After the first day out, the thought of a drink never troubled\nme.  This I take to show how intrinsically I am not an alcoholic.\nSometimes, during the traverse, looking ahead and anticipating the\ndelightful lanai luncheons and dinners of Hawaii (I had been there a\ncouple of times before), I thought, naturally, of the drinks that would\nprecede those meals.  I did not think of those drinks with any yearning,\nwith any irk at the length of the voyage.  I merely thought they would be\nnice and jolly, part of the atmosphere of a proper meal.\n\nThus, once again I proved to my complete satisfaction that I was John\nBarleycorn's master.  I could drink when I wanted, refrain when I wanted.\nTherefore I would continue to drink when I wanted.\n\nSome five months were spent in the various islands of the Hawaiian group.\nBeing ashore, I drank.  I even drank a bit more than I had been\naccustomed to drink in California prior to the voyage.  The people in\nHawaii seemed to drink a bit more, on the average, than the people in\nmore temperate latitudes.  I do not intend the pun, and can awkwardly\nrevise the statement to \"latitudes more remote from the equator.\" Yet\nHawaii is only sub-tropical.  The deeper I got into the tropics, the\ndeeper I found men drank, the deeper I drank myself.\n\nFrom Hawaii we sailed for the Marquesas.  The traverse occupied sixty\ndays.  For sixty days we never raised land, a sail, nor a steamer smoke.\nBut early in those sixty days the cook, giving an overhauling to the\ngalley, made a find.  Down in the bottom of a deep locker he found a\ndozen bottles of angelica and muscatel.  These had come down from the\nkitchen cellar of the ranch along with the home-preserved fruits and\njellies.  Six months in the galley heat had effected some sort of a\nchange in the thick sweet wine--branded it, I imagine.\n\nI took a taste.  Delicious! And thereafter, once each day, at twelve\no'clock, after our observations were worked up and the Snark's position\ncharted, I drank half a tumbler of the stuff.  It had a rare kick to it.\nIt warmed the cockles of my geniality and put a fairer face on the truly\nfair face of the sea.  Each morning, below, sweating out my thousand\nwords, I found myself looking forward to that twelve o'clock event of the\nday.\n\nThe trouble was I had to share the stuff, and the length of the traverse\nwas doubtful.  I regretted that there were not more than a dozen bottles.\nAnd when they were gone I even regretted that I had shared any of it.  I\nwas thirsty for the alcohol, and eager to arrive in the Marquesas.\n\nSo it was that I reached the Marquesas the possessor of a real man's size\nthirst.  And in the Marquesas were several white men, a lot of sickly\nnatives, much magnificent scenery, plenty of trade rum, an immense\nquantity of absinthe, but neither whisky nor gin.  The trade rum scorched\nthe skin off one's mouth.  I know, because I tried it.  But I had ever\nbeen plastic, and I accepted the absinthe.  The trouble with the stuff\nwas that I had to take such inordinate quantities in order to feel the\nslightest effect.\n\nFrom the Marquesas I sailed with sufficient absinthe in ballast to last\nme to Tahiti, where I outfitted with Scotch and American whisky, and\nthereafter there were no dry stretches between ports.  But please do not\nmisunderstand.  There was no drunkenness, as drunkenness is ordinarily\nunderstood--no staggering and rolling around, no befuddlement of the\nsenses.  The skilled and seasoned drinker, with a strong constitution,\nnever descends to anything like that.  He drinks to feel good, to get a\npleasant jingle, and no more than that.  The things he carefully avoids\nare the nausea of over-drinking, the after-effect of over-drinking, the\nhelplessness and loss of pride of over-drinking.\n\nWhat the skilled and seasoned drinker achieves is a discreet and canny\nsemi-intoxication.  And he does it by the twelve-month around without any\napparent penalty.  There are hundreds of thousands of men of this sort in\nthe United States to-day, in clubs, hotels, and in their own homes--men\nwho are never drunk, and who, though most of them will indignantly deny\nit, are rarely sober.  And all of them fondly believe, as I fondly\nbelieved, that they are beating the game.\n\nOn the sea-stretches I was fairly abstemious; but ashore I drank more.  I\nseemed to need more, anyway, in the tropics.  This is a common\nexperience, for the excessive consumption of alcohol in the tropics by\nwhite men is a notorious fact.  The tropics is no place for white-skinned\nmen.  Their skin-pigment does not protect them against the excessive\nwhite light of the sun.  The ultra-violet rays, and other high-velocity\nand invisible rays from the upper end of the spectrum, rip and tear\nthrough their tissues, just as the X-ray ripped and tore through the\ntissues of so many experimenters before they learned the danger.\n\nWhite men in the tropics undergo radical changes of nature.  They become\nsavage, merciless.  They commit monstrous acts of cruelty that they would\nnever dream of committing in their original temperate climate.  They\nbecome nervous, irritable, and less moral.  And they drink as they never\ndrank before.  Drinking is one form of the many forms of degeneration\nthat set in when white men are exposed too long to too much white light.\nThe increase of alcoholic consumption is automatic.  The tropics is no\nplace for a long sojourn.  They seem doomed to die anyway, and the heavy\ndrinking expedites the process.  They don't reason about it.  They just\ndo it.\n\nThe sun sickness got me, despite the fact that I had been in the tropics\nonly a couple of years.  I drank heavily during this time, but right here\nI wish to forestall misunderstanding.  The drinking was not the cause of\nthe sickness, nor of the abandonment of the voyage.  I was strong as a\nbull, and for many months I fought the sun sickness that was ripping and\ntearing my surface and nervous tissues to pieces.  All through the New\nHebrides and the Solomons and up among the atolls on the Line, during\nthis period under a tropic sun, rotten with malaria, and suffering from a\nfew minor afflictions such as Biblical leprosy with the silvery skin, I\ndid the work of five men.\n\nTo navigate a vessel through the reefs and shoals and passages and\nunlighted coasts of the coral seas is a man's work in itself.  I was the\nonly navigator on board.  There was no one to check me up on the working\nout of my observations, nor with whom I could advise in the ticklish\ndarkness among uncharted reefs and shoals.  And I stood all watches.\nThere was no sea-man on board whom I could trust to stand a mate's watch.\nI was mate as well as captain.  Twenty-four hours a day were the watches\nI stood at sea, catching cat-naps when I might.  Third, I was doctor.\nAnd let me say right here that the doctor's job on the Snark at that time\nwas a man's job.  All on board suffered from malaria--the real, tropical\nmalaria that can kill in three months.  All on board suffered from\nperforating ulcers and from the maddening itch of ngari-ngari.  A\nJapanese cook went insane from his too numerous afflictions.  One of my\nPolynesian sailors lay at death's door with blackwater fever.  Oh, yes,\nit was a full man's job, and I dosed and doctored, and pulled teeth, and\ndragged my patients through mild little things like ptomaine poisoning.\n\nFourth, I was a writer.  I sweated out my thousand words a day, every\nday, except when the shock of fever smote me, or a couple of nasty\nsqualls smote the Snark, in the morning.  Fifth, I was a traveller and a\nwriter, eager to see things and to gather material into my note-books.\nAnd, sixth, I was master and owner of the craft that was visiting strange\nplaces where visitors are rare and where visitors are made much of.  So\nhere I had to hold up the social end, entertain on board, be entertained\nashore by planters, traders, governors, captains of war vessels,\nkinky-headed cannibal kings, and prime ministers sometimes fortunate\nenough to be clad in cotton shifts.\n\nOf course I drank.  I drank with my guests and hosts.  Also, I drank by\nmyself.  Doing the work of five men, I thought, entitled me to drink.\nAlcohol was good for a man who over-worked.  I noted its effect on my\nsmall crew, when, breaking their backs and hearts at heaving up anchor in\nforty fathoms, they knocked off gasping and trembling at the end of half\nan hour and had new life put into them by stiff jolts of rum.  They\ncaught their breaths, wiped their mouths, and went to it again with a\nwill.  And when we careened the Snark and had to work in the water to our\nnecks between shocks of fever, I noted how raw trade rum helped the work\nalong.\n\nAnd here again we come to another side of many-sided John Barleycorn.  On\nthe face of it, he gives something for nothing.  Where no strength\nremains he finds new strength.  The wearied one rises to greater effort.\nFor the time being there is an actual accession of strength.  I remember\npassing coal on an ocean steamer through eight days of hell, during which\ntime we coal-passers were kept to the job by being fed with whisky.  We\ntoiled half drunk all the time.  And without the whisky we could not have\npassed the coal.\n\nThis strength John Barleycorn gives is not fictitious strength.  It is\nreal strength.  But it is manufactured out of the sources of strength,\nand it must ultimately be paid for, and with interest.  But what weary\nhuman will look so far ahead? He takes this apparently miraculous\naccession of strength at its face value.  And many an overworked business\nand professional man, as well as a harried common labourer, has travelled\nJohn Barleycorn's death road because of this mistake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nI went to Australia to go into hospital and get tinkered up, after which\nI planned to go on with the voyage.  And during the long weeks I lay in\nhospital, from the first day I never missed alcohol.  I never thought\nabout it.  I knew I should have it again when I was on my feet.  But when\nI regained my feet I was not cured of my major afflictions.  Naaman's\nsilvery skin was still mine.  The mysterious sun-sickness, which the\nexperts of Australia could not fathom, still ripped and tore my tissues.\nMalaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium\nat the most unexpected moments, compelling me to cancel a double lecture\ntour which had been arranged.\n\nSo I abandoned the Snark voyage and sought a cooler climate.  The day I\ncame out of hospital I took up drinking again as a matter of course.  I\ndrank wine at meals.  I drank cocktails before meals.  I drank Scotch\nhighballs when anybody I chanced to be with was drinking them.  I was so\nthoroughly the master of John Barleycorn I could take up with him or let\ngo of him whenever I pleased, just as I had done all my life.\n\nAfter a time, for cooler climate, I went down to southermost Tasmania in\nforty-three South.  And I found myself in a place where there was nothing\nto drink.  It didn't mean anything.  I didn't drink.  It was no hardship.\nI soaked in the cool air, rode horseback, and did my thousand words a day\nsave when the fever shock came in the morning.\n\nAnd for fear that the idea may still lurk in some minds that my preceding\nyears of drinking were the cause of my disabilities, I here point out\nthat my Japanese cabin boy, Nakata, still with me, was rotten with fever,\nas was Charmian, who in addition was in the slough of a tropical\nneurasthenia that required several years of temperate climates to cure,\nand that neither she nor Nakata drank or ever had drunk.\n\nWhen I returned to Hobart Town, where drink was obtainable, I drank as of\nold.  The same when I arrived back in Australia.  On the contrary, when I\nsailed from Australia on a tramp steamer commanded by an abstemious\ncaptain, I took no drink along, and had no drink for the forty-three\ndays' passage.  Arrived in Ecuador, squarely under the equatorial sun,\nwhere the humans were dying of yellow fever, smallpox, and the plague, I\npromptly drank again--every drink of every sort that had a kick in it.  I\ncaught none of these diseases.  Neither did Charmian nor Nakata who did\nnot drink.\n\nEnamoured of the tropics, despite the damage done me, I stopped in\nvarious places, and was a long while getting back to the splendid,\ntemperate climate of California.  I did my thousand words a day,\ntravelling or stopping over, suffered my last faint fever shock, saw my\nsilvery skin vanish and my sun-torn tissues healthily knit again, and\ndrank as a broad-shouldered chesty man may drink.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nBack on the ranch, in the Valley of the Moon, I resumed my steady\ndrinking.  My programme was no drink in the morning; first drink-time\ncame with the completion of my thousand words.  Then, between that and\nthe midday meal, were drinks numerous enough to develop a pleasant\njingle.  Again, in the hour preceding the evening meal, I developed\nanother pleasant jingle.  Nobody ever saw me drunk, for the simple reason\nthat I never was drunk.  But I did get a jingle twice each day; and the\namount of alcohol I consumed every day, if loosed in the system of one\nunaccustomed to drink, would have put such a one on his back and out.\n\nIt was the old proposition.  The more I drank, the more I was compelled\nto drink in order to get an effect.  The time came when cocktails were\ninadequate.  I had neither the time in which to drink them nor the space\nto accommodate them.  Whisky had a more powerful jolt.  It gave quicker\naction with less quantity.  Bourbon or rye, or cunningly aged blends,\nconstituted the pre-midday drinking.  In the late afternoon it was Scotch\nand soda.\n\nMy sleep, always excellent, now became not quite so excellent.  I had\nbeen accustomed to read myself back asleep when I chanced to awake.  But\nnow this began to fail me.  When I had read two or three of the small\nhours away and was as wide awake as ever, I found that a drink furnished\nthe soporific effect.  Sometimes two or three drinks were required.\n\nSo short a period of sleep then intervened before early morning rising\nthat my system did not have time to work off the alcohol.  As a result I\nawoke with mouth parched and dry, with a slight heaviness of head, and\nwith a mild nervous palpitation in the stomach.  In fact I did not feel\ngood.  I was suffering from the morning sickness of the steady, heavy\ndrinker.  What I needed was a pick-me-up, a bracer.  Trust John\nBarleycorn, once he has broken down a man's defences! So it was a drink\nbefore breakfast to put me right for breakfast--the old poison of the\nsnake that has bitten one! Another custom begun at this time was that of\nthe pitcher of water by the bedside to furnish relief to my scorched and\nsizzling membranes.\n\nI achieved a condition in which my body was never free from alcohol.  Nor\ndid I permit myself to be away from alcohol.  If I travelled to\nout-of-the-way places, I declined to run the risk of finding them dry.  I\ntook a quart, or several quarts, along in my grip.  In the past I had\nbeen amazed by other men guilty of this practice.  Now I did it myself\nunblushingly.  And when I got out with the fellows, I cast all rules by\nthe board.  I drank when they drank, what they drank, and in the same way\nthey drank.\n\nI was carrying a beautiful alcoholic conflagration around with me.  The\nthing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer.  There was no time, in\nall my waking time, that I didn't want a drink.  I began to anticipate\nthe completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only\nfive hundred words were written.  It was not long until I prefaced the\nbeginning of the thousand words with a drink.\n\nThe gravity of this I realised too well.  I made new rules.  Resolutely I\nwould refrain from drinking until my work was done.  But a new and most\ndiabolical complication arose.  The work refused to be done without\ndrinking.  It just couldn't be done.  I had to drink in order to do it.\nI was beginning to fight now.  I had the craving at last, and it was\nmastering me.  I would sit at my desk and dally with pad and pen, but\nwords refused to flow.  My brain could not think the proper thoughts\nbecause continually it was obsessed with the one thought that across the\nroom in the liquor cabinet stood John Barleycorn.  When, in despair, I\ntook my drink, at once my brain loosened up and began to roll off the\nthousand words.\n\nIn my town house, in Oakland, I finished the stock of liquor and wilfully\nrefused to purchase more.  It was no use, because, unfortunately, there\nremained in the bottom of the liquor cabinet a case of beer.  In vain I\ntried to write.  Now beer is a poor substitute for strong waters:\nbesides, I didn't like beer, yet all I could think of was that beer so\nsingularly accessible in the bottom of the cabinet.  Not until I had\ndrunk a pint of it did the words begin to reel off, and the thousand were\nreeled off to the tune of numerous pints.  The worst of it was that the\nbeer caused me severe heart-burn; but despite the discomfort I soon\nfinished off the case.\n\nThe liquor cabinet was now bare.  I did not replenish it.  By truly\nheroic perseverance I finally forced myself to write the daily thousand\nwords without the spur of John Barleycorn.  But all the time I wrote I\nwas keenly aware of the craving for a drink.  And as soon as the\nmorning's work was done, I was out of the house and away down-town to get\nmy first drink.  Merciful goodness!--if John Barleycorn could get such\nsway over me, a non-alcoholic, what must be the sufferings of the true\nalcoholic, battling against the organic demands of his chemistry while\nthose closest to him sympathise little, understand less, and despise and\nderide him!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nBut the freight has to be paid.  John Barleycorn began to collect, and he\ncollected not so much from the body as from the mind.  The old long\nsickness, which had been purely an intellectual sickness, recrudesced.\nThe old ghosts, long laid, lifted their heads again.  But they were\ndifferent and more deadly ghosts.  The old ghosts, intellectual in their\ninception, had been laid by a sane and normal logic.  But now they were\nraised by the White Logic of John Barleycorn, and John Barleycorn never\nlays the ghosts of his raising.  For this sickness of pessimism, caused\nby drink, one must drink further in quest of the anodyne that John\nBarleycorn promises but never delivers.\n\nHow to describe this White Logic to those who have never experienced it!\nIt is perhaps better first to state how impossible such a description is.\nTake Hasheesh Land, for instance, the land of enormous extensions of time\nand space.  In past years I have made two memorable journeys into that\nfar land.  My adventures there are seared in sharpest detail on my brain.\nYet I have tried vainly, with endless words, to describe any tiny\nparticular phase to persons who have not travelled there.\n\nI use all the hyperbole of metaphor, and tell what centuries of time and\nprofounds of unthinkable agony and horror can obtain in each interval of\nall the intervals between the notes of a quick jig played quickly on the\npiano.  I talk for an hour, elaborating that one phase of Hasheesh Land,\nand at the end I have told them nothing.  And when I cannot tell them\nthis one thing of all the vastness of terrible and wonderful things, I\nknow I have failed to give them the slightest concept of Hasheesh Land.\n\nBut let me talk with some other traveller in that weird region, and at\nonce am I understood.  A phrase, a word, conveys instantly to his mind\nwhat hours of words and phrases could not convey to the mind of the\nnon-traveller.  So it is with John Barleycorn's realm where the White\nLogic reigns.  To those untravelled there, the traveller's account must\nalways seem unintelligible and fantastic.  At the best, I may only beg of\nthe untravelled ones to strive to take on faith the narrative I shall\nrelate.\n\nFor there are fatal intuitions of truth that reside in alcohol.  Philip\nsober vouches for Philip drunk in this matter.  There seem to be various\norders of truth in this world.  Some sorts of truth are truer than\nothers.  Some sorts of truth are lies, and these sorts are the very ones\nthat have the greatest use-value to life that desires to realise and\nlive.  At once, O untravelled reader, you see how lunatic and blasphemous\nis the realm I am trying to describe to you in the language of John\nBarleycorn's tribe.  It is not the language of your tribe, all of whose\nmembers resolutely shun the roads that lead to death and tread only the\nroads that lead to life.  For there are roads and roads, and of truth\nthere are orders and orders.  But have patience.  At least, through what\nseems no more than verbal yammerings, you may, perchance, glimpse faint\nfar vistas of other lands and tribes.\n\nAlcohol tells truth, but its truth is not normal.  What is normal is\nhealthful.  What is healthful tends toward life.  Normal truth is a\ndifferent order, and a lesser order, of truth.  Take a dray horse.\nThrough all the vicissitudes of its life, from first to last, somehow, in\nunguessably dim ways, it must believe that life is good; that the\ndrudgery in harness is good; that death, no matter how\nblind-instinctively apprehended, is a dread giant; that life is\nbeneficent and worth while; that, in the end, with fading life, it will\nnot be knocked about and beaten and urged beyond its sprained and\nspavined best; that old age, even, is decent, dignified, and valuable,\nthough old age means a ribby scare-crow in a hawker's cart, stumbling a\nstep to every blow, stumbling dizzily on through merciless servitude and\nslow disintegration to the end--the end, the apportionment of its parts\n(of its subtle flesh, its pink and springy bone, its juices and ferments,\nand all the sensateness that informed it) to the chicken farm, the\nhide-house, the glue-rendering works, and the bone-meal fertiliser\nfactory.  To the last stumble of its stumbling end this dray horse must\nabide by the mandates of the lesser truth that is the truth of life and\nthat makes life possible to persist.\n\nThis dray horse, like all other horses, like all other animals, including\nman, is life-blinded and sense-struck.  It will live, no matter what the\nprice.  The game of life is good, though all of life may be hurt, and\nthough all lives lose the game in the end.  This is the order of truth\nthat obtains, not for the universe, but for the live things in it if they\nfor a little space will endure ere they pass.  This order of truth, no\nmatter how erroneous it may be, is the sane and normal order of truth,\nthe rational order of truth that life must believe in order to live.\n\nTo man, alone among the animals, has been given the awful privilege of\nreason.  Man, with his brain, can penetrate the intoxicating show of\nthings and look upon the universe brazen with indifference toward him and\nhis dreams.  He can do this, but it is not well for him to do it.  To\nlive, and live abundantly, to sting with life, to be alive (which is to\nbe what he is), it is good that man be life-blinded and sense-struck.\nWhat is good is true.  And this is the order of truth, lesser though it\nbe, that man must know and guide his actions by with unswerving certitude\nthat it is absolute truth and that in the universe no other order of\ntruth can obtain.  It is good that man should accept at face value the\ncheats of sense and snares of flesh and through the fogs of sentiency\npursue the lures and lies of passion.  It is good that he shall see\nneither shadows nor futilities, nor be appalled by his lusts and\nrapacities.\n\nAnd man does this.  Countless men have glimpsed that other and truer\norder of truth and recoiled from it.  Countless men have passed through\nthe long sickness and lived to tell of it and deliberately to forget it\nto the end of their days.  They lived.  They realised life, for life is\nwhat they were.  They did right.\n\nAnd now comes John Barleycorn with the curse he lays upon the imaginative\nman who is lusty with life and desire to live.  John Barleycorn sends his\nWhite Logic, the argent messenger of truth beyond truth, the antithesis\nof life, cruel and bleak as interstellar space, pulseless and frozen as\nabsolute zero, dazzling with the frost of irrefragable logic and\nunforgettable fact.  John Barleycorn will not let the dreamer dream, the\nliver live.  He destroys birth and death, and dissipates to mist the\nparadox of being, until his victim cries out, as in \"The City of Dreadful\nNight\": \"Our life's a cheat, our death a black abyss.\" And the feet of\nthe victim of such dreadful intimacy take hold of the way of death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nBack to personal experiences and the effects in the past of John\nBarleycorn's White Logic on me.  On my lovely ranch in the Valley of the\nMoon, brain-soaked with many months of alcohol, I am oppressed by the\ncosmic sadness that has always been the heritage of man.  In vain do I\nask myself why I should be sad.  My nights are warm.  My roof does not\nleak.  I have food galore for all the caprices of appetite.  Every\ncreature comfort is mine.  In my body are no aches nor pains.  The good\nold flesh-machine is running smoothly on.  Neither brain nor muscle is\noverworked.  I have land, money, power, recognition from the world, a\nconsciousness that I do my meed of good in serving others, a mate whom I\nlove, children that are of my own fond flesh.  I have done, and am doing,\nwhat a good citizen of the world should do.  I have built houses, many\nhouses, and tilled many a hundred acres.  And as for trees, have I not\nplanted a hundred thousand? Everywhere, from any window of my house, I\ncan gaze forth upon these trees of my planting, standing valiantly erect\nand aspiring toward the sun.\n\nMy life has indeed fallen in pleasant places.  Not a hundred men in a\nmillion have been so lucky as I.  Yet, with all this vast good fortune,\nam I sad.  And I am sad because John Barleycorn is with me.  And John\nBarleycorn is with me because I was born in what future ages will call\nthe dark ages before the ages of rational civilisation.  John Barleycorn\nis with me because in all the unwitting days of my youth John Barleycorn\nwas accessible, calling to me and inviting me on every corner and on\nevery street between the corners.  The pseudo-civilisation into which I\nwas born permitted everywhere licensed shops for the sale of soul-poison.\nThe system of life was so organised that I (and millions like me) was\nlured and drawn and driven to the poison shops.\n\nWander with me through one mood of the myriad moods of sadness into which\none is plunged by John Barleycorn.  I ride out over my beautiful ranch.\nBetween my legs is a beautiful horse.  The air is wine.  The grapes on a\nscore of rolling hills are red with autumn flame.  Across Sonoma Mountain\nwisps of sea fog are stealing.  The afternoon sun smoulders in the drowsy\nsky.  I have everything to make me glad I am alive.  I am filled with\ndreams and mysteries.  I am all sun and air and sparkle.  I am vitalised,\norganic.  I move, I have the power of movement, I command movement of the\nlive thing I bestride.  I am possessed with the pomps of being, and know\nproud passions and inspirations.  I have ten thousand august\nconnotations.  I am a king in the kingdom of sense, and trample the face\nof the uncomplaining dust....\n\nAnd yet, with jaundiced eye I gaze upon all the beauty and wonder about\nme, and with jaundiced brain consider the pitiful figure I cut in this\nworld that endured so long without me and that will again endure without\nme.  I remember the men who broke their hearts and their backs over this\nstubborn soil that now belongs to me.  As if anything imperishable could\nbelong to the perishable!  These men passed.  I, too, shall pass.  These\nmen toiled, and cleared, and planted, gazed with aching eyes, while they\nrested their labour-stiffened bodies on these same sunrises and sunsets,\nat the autumn glory of the grape, and at the fog-wisps stealing across\nthe mountain.  And they are gone.  And I know that I, too, shall some\nday, and soon, be gone.\n\nGone? I am going now.  In my jaw are cunning artifices of the dentists\nwhich replace the parts of me already gone.  Never again will I have the\nthumbs of my youth.  Old fights and wrestlings have injured them\nirreparably.  That punch on the head of a man whose very name is\nforgotten settled this thumb finally and for ever.  A slip-grip at\ncatch-as-catch-can did for the other.  My lean runner's stomach has\npassed into the limbo of memory.  The joints of the legs that bear me up\nare not so adequate as they once were, when, in wild nights and days of\ntoil and frolic, I strained and snapped and ruptured them.  Never again\ncan I swing dizzily aloft and trust all the proud quick that is I to a\nsingle rope-clutch in the driving blackness of storm.  Never again can I\nrun with the sled-dogs along the endless miles of Arctic trail.\n\nI am aware that within this disintegrating body which has been dying\nsince I was born I carry a skeleton, that under the rind of flesh which\nis called my face is a bony, noseless death's head.  All of which does\nnot shudder me.  To be afraid is to be healthy.  Fear of death makes for\nlife.  But the curse of the White Logic is that it does not make one\nafraid.  The world-sickness of the White Logic makes one grin jocosely\ninto the face of the Noseless One and to sneer at all the phantasmagoria\nof living.\n\nI look about me as I ride and on every hand I see the merciless and\ninfinite waste of natural selection.  The White Logic insists upon\nopening the long-closed books, and by paragraph and chapter states the\nbeauty and wonder I behold in terms of futility and dust.  About me is\nmurmur and hum, and I know it for the gnat-swarm of the living, piping\nfor a little space its thin plaint of troubled air.\n\nI return across the ranch.  Twilight is on, and the hunting animals are\nout.  I watch the piteous tragic play of life feeding on life.  Here is\nno morality.  Only in man is morality, and man created it--a code of\naction that makes toward living and that is of the lesser order of truth.\nYet all this I knew before, in the weary days of my long sickness.  These\nwere the greater truths that I so successfully schooled myself to forget;\nthe truths that were so serious that I refused to take them seriously,\nand played with gently, oh! so gently, as sleeping dogs at the back of\nconsciousness which I did not care to waken.  I did but stir them, and\nlet them lie.  I was too wise, too wicked wise, to wake them.  But now\nWhite Logic willy-nilly wakes them for me, for White Logic, most valiant,\nis unafraid of all the monsters of the earthly dream.\n\n\"Let the doctors of all the schools condemn me,\" White Logic whispers as\nI ride along.  \"What of it? I am truth.  You know it.  You cannot combat\nme.  They say I make for death.  What of it? It is truth.  Life lies in\norder to live.  Life is a perpetual lie-telling process.  Life is a mad\ndance in the domain of flux, wherein appearances in mighty tides ebb and\nflow, chained to the wheels of moons beyond our ken.  Appearances are\nghosts.  Life is ghost land, where appearances change, transfuse,\npermeate each the other and all the others, that are, that are not, that\nalways flicker, fade, and pass, only to come again as new appearances, as\nother appearances.  You are such an appearance, composed of countless\nappearances out of the past.  All an appearance can know is mirage.  You\nknow mirages of desire.  These very mirages are the unthinkable and\nincalculable congeries of appearances that crowd in upon you and form you\nout of the past, and that sweep you on into dissemination into other\nunthinkable and incalculable congeries of appearances to people the ghost\nland of the future.  Life is apparitional, and passes.  You are an\napparition.  Through all the apparitions that preceded you and that\ncompose the parts of you, you rose gibbering from the evolutionary mire,\nand gibbering you will pass on, interfusing, permeating the procession of\napparitions that will succeed you.\"\n\nAnd of course it is all unanswerable, and as I ride along through the\nevening shadows I sneer at that Great Fetish which Comte called the\nworld.  And I remember what another pessimist of sentiency has uttered:\n\"Transient are all.  They, being born, must die, and, being dead, are\nglad to be at rest.\"\n\nBut here through the dusk comes one who is not glad to be at rest.  He is\na workman on the ranch, an old man, an immigrant Italian.  He takes his\nhat off to me in all servility, because, forsooth, I am to him a lord of\nlife.  I am food to him, and shelter, and existence.  He has toiled like\na beast all his days, and lived less comfortably than my horses in their\ndeep-strawed stalls.  He is labour-crippled.  He shambles as he walks.\nOne shoulder is twisted higher than the other.  His hands are gnarled\nclaws, repulsive, horrible.  As an apparition he is a pretty miserable\nspecimen.  His brain is as stupid as his body is ugly.\n\n\"His brain is so stupid that he does not know he is an apparition,\" the\nWhite Logic chuckles to me.  \"He is sense-drunk.  He is the slave of the\ndream of life.  His brain is filled with superrational sanctions and\nobsessions.  He believes in a transcendent over-world.  He has listened\nto the vagaries of the prophets, who have given to him the sumptuous\nbubble of Paradise.  He feels inarticulate self-affinities, with\nself-conjured non-realities.  He sees penumbral visions of himself\ntitubating fantastically through days and nights of space and stars.\nBeyond the shadow of any doubt he is convinced that the universe was made\nfor him, and that it is his destiny to live for ever in the immaterial\nand supersensuous realms he and his kind have builded of the stuff of\nsemblance and deception.\n\n\"But you, who have opened the books and who share my awful\nconfidence--you know him for what he is, brother to you and the dust, a\ncosmic joke, a sport of chemistry, a garmented beast that arose out of\nthe ruck of screaming beastliness by virtue and accident of two opposable\ngreat toes.  He is brother as well to the gorilla and the chimpanzee.  He\nthumps his chest in anger, and roars and quivers with cataleptic\nferocity.  He knows monstrous, atavistic promptings, and he is composed\nof all manner of shreds of abysmal and forgotten instincts.\"\n\n\"Yet he dreams he is immortal,\" I argue feebly.  \"It is vastly wonderful\nfor so stupid a clod to bestride the shoulders of time and ride the\neternities.\"\n\n\"Pah!\" is the retort.  \"Would you then shut the books and exchange places\nwith this thing that is only an appetite and a desire, a marionette of\nthe belly and the loins?\"\n\n\"To be stupid is to be happy,\" I contend.\n\n\"Then your ideal of happiness is a jelly-like organism floating in a\ntideless, tepid twilight sea, eh?\"\n\nOh, the victim cannot combat John Barleycorn!\n\n\"One step removed from the annihilating bliss of Buddha's Nirvana,\" the\nWhite Logic adds.  \"Oh well, here's the house.  Cheer up and take a\ndrink.  We know, we illuminated, you and I, all the folly and the farce.\"\n\nAnd in my book-walled den, the mausoleum of the thoughts of men, I take\nmy drink, and other drinks, and roust out the sleeping dogs from the\nrecesses of my brain and hallo them on over the walls of prejudice and\nlaw and through all the cunning labyrinths of superstition and belief.\n\n\"Drink,\" says the White Logic.  \"The Greeks believed that the gods gave\nthem wine so that they might forget the miserableness of existence.  And\nremember what Heine said.\"\n\nWell do I remember that flaming Jew's \"With the last breath all is done:\njoy, love, sorrow, macaroni, the theatre, lime-trees, raspberry drops,\nthe power of human relations, gossip, the barking of dogs, champagne.\"\n\n\"Your clear white light is sickness,\" I tell the White Logic.  \"You lie.\"\n\n\"By telling too strong a truth,\" he quips back.\n\n\"Alas, yes, so topsy-turvy is existence,\" I acknowledge sadly.\n\n\"Ah, well, Liu Ling was wiser than you,\" the White Logic girds.  \"You\nremember him?\"\n\nI nod my head--Liu Ling, a hard drinker, one of the group of bibulous\npoets who called themselves the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove and who\nlived in China many an ancient century ago.\n\n\"It was Liu Ling,\" prompts the White Logic, \"who declared that to a\ndrunken man the affairs of this world appear but as so much duckweed on a\nriver.  Very well.  Have another Scotch, and let semblance and deception\nbecome duck-weed on a river.\"\n\nAnd while I pour and sip my Scotch, I remember another Chinese\nphilosopher, Chuang Tzu, who, four centuries before Christ, challenged\nthis dreamland of the world, saying: \"How then do I know but that the\ndead repent of having previously clung to life?  Those who dream of the\nbanquet, wake to lamentation and sorrow.  Those who dream of lamentation\nand sorrow, wake to join the hunt.  While they dream, they do not know\nthat they dream.  Some will even interpret the very dream they are\ndreaming; and only when they awake do they know it was a dream....  Fools\nthink they are awake now, and flatter themselves they know if they are\nreally princes or peasants.  Confucius and you are both dreams; and I who\nsay you are dreams--I am but a dream myself.\n\n\"Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzu, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering\nhither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly.  I was\nconscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and was\nunconscious of my individuality as a man.  Suddenly, I awaked, and there\nI lay, myself again.  Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming\nI was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\n\"Come,\" says the White Logic, \"and forget these Asian dreamers of old\ntime.  Fill your glass and let us look at the parchments of the dreamers\nof yesterday who dreamed their dreams on your own warm hills.\"\n\nI pore over the abstract of title of the vineyard called Tokay on the\nrancho called Petaluma.  It is a sad long list of the names of men,\nbeginning with Manuel Micheltoreno, one time Mexican \"Governor,\nCommander-in-Chief, and Inspector of the Department of the Californias,\"\nwho deeded ten square leagues of stolen Indian land to Colonel Don\nMariano Guadalupe Vallejo for services rendered his country and for\nmoneys paid by him for ten years to his soldiers.\n\nImmediately this musty record of man's land lust assumes the\nformidableness of a battle--the quick struggling with the dust.  There\nare deeds of trust, mortgages, certificates of release, transfers,\njudgments, foreclosures, writs of attachment, orders of sale, tax liens,\npetitions for letters of administration, and decrees of distribution.  It\nis like a monster ever unsubdued, this stubborn land that drowses in this\nIndian summer weather and that survives them all, the men who scratched\nits surface and passed.\n\nWho was this James King of William, so curiously named? The oldest\nsurviving settler in the Valley of the Moon knows him not.  Yet only\nsixty years ago he loaned Mariano G. Vallejo eighteen thousand dollars on\nsecurity of certain lands including the vineyard yet to be and to be\ncalled Tokay.  Whence came Peter O'Connor, and whither vanished, after\nwriting his little name of a day on the woodland that was to become a\nvineyard? Appears Louis Csomortanyi, a name to conjure with.  He lasts\nthrough several pages of this record of the enduring soil.\n\nComes old American stock, thirsting across the Great American Desert,\nmule-backing across the Isthmus, wind-jamming around the Horn, to write\nbrief and forgotten names where ten thousand generations of wild Indians\nare equally forgotten--names like Halleck, Hastings, Swett, Tait, Denman,\nTracy, Grimwood, Carlton, Temple.  There are no names like those to-day\nin the Valley of the Moon.\n\nThe names begin to appear fast and furiously, flashing from legal page to\nlegal page and in a flash vanishing.  But ever the persistent soil\nremains for others to scrawl themselves across.  Come the names of men of\nwhom I have vaguely heard but whom I have never known.  Kohler and\nFrohling--who built the great stone winery on the vineyard called Tokay,\nbut who built upon a hill up which other vineyardists refused to haul\ntheir grapes.  So Kohler and Frohling lost the land; the earthquake of\n1906 threw down the winery; and I now live in its ruins.\n\nLa Motte--he broke the soil, planted vines and orchards, instituted\ncommercial fish culture, built a mansion renowned in its day, was\ndefeated by the soil, and passed.  And my name of a day appears.  On the\nsite of his orchards and vine-yards, of his proud mansion, of his very\nfish ponds, I have scrawled myself with half a hundred thousand\neucalyptus trees.\n\nCooper and Greenlaw--on what is called the Hill Ranch they left two of\ntheir dead, \"Little Lillie\" and \"Little David,\" who rest to-day inside a\ntiny square of hand-hewn palings.  Also, Cooper and Greenlaw in their\ntime cleared the virgin forest from three fields of forty acres.  To-day\nI have those three fields sown with Canada peas, and in the spring they\nshall be ploughed under for green manure.\n\nHaska--a dim legendary figure of a generation ago, who went back up the\nmountain and cleared six acres of brush in the tiny valley that took his\nname.  He broke the soil, reared stone walls and a house, and planted\napple trees.  And already the site of the house is undiscoverable, the\nlocation of the stone walls may be deduced from the configuration of the\nlandscape, and I am renewing the battle, putting in angora goats to\nbrowse away the brush that has overrun Haska's clearing and choked\nHaska's apple trees to death.  So I, too, scratch the land with my brief\nendeavour and flash my name across a page of legal script ere I pass and\nthe page grows musty.\n\n\"Dreamers and ghosts,\" the White Logic chuckles.\n\n\"But surely the striving was not altogether vain,\" I contend.\n\n\"It was based on illusion and is a lie.\"\n\n\"A vital lie,\" I retort.\n\n\"And pray what is a vital lie but a lie?\" the White Logic challenges.\n\"Come.  Fill your glass and let us examine these vital liars who crowd\nyour bookshelves.  Let us dabble in William James a bit.\"\n\n\"A man of health,\" I say.  \"From him we may expect no philosopher's\nstone, but at least we will find a few robust tonic things to which to\ntie.\"\n\n\"Rationality gelded to sentiment,\" the White Logic grins.  \"At the end of\nall his thinking he still clung to the sentiment of immortality.  Facts\ntransmuted in the alembic of hope into terms of faith.  The ripest fruit\nof reason the stultification of reason.  From the topmost peak of reason\nJames teaches to cease reasoning and to have faith that all is well and\nwill be well--the old, oh, ancient old, acrobatic flip of the\nmetaphysicians whereby they reasoned reason quite away in order to escape\nthe pessimism consequent upon the grim and honest exercise of reason.\n\n\"Is this flesh of yours you? Or is it an extraneous something possessed\nby you? Your body--what is it? A machine for converting stimuli into\nreactions.  Stimuli and reactions are remembered.  They constitute\nexperience.  Then you are in your consciousness these experiences.  You\nare at any moment what you are thinking at that moment.  Your I is both\nsubject and object; it predicates things of itself and is the things\npredicated.  The thinker is the thought, the knower is what is known, the\npossessor is the things possessed.\n\n\"After all, as you know well, man is a flux of states of consciousness, a\nflow of passing thoughts, each thought of self another self, a myriad\nthoughts, a myriad selves, a continual becoming but never being, a\nwill-of-the-wisp flitting of ghosts in ghostland.  But this, man will not\naccept of himself.  He refuses to accept his own passing.  He will not\npass.  He will live again if he has to die to do it.\n\n\"He shuffles atoms and jets of light, remotest nebulae, drips of water,\nprick-points of sensation, slime-oozings and cosmic bulks, all mixed with\npearls of faith, love of woman, imagined dignities, frightened surmises,\nand pompous arrogances, and of the stuff builds himself an immortality to\nstartle the heavens and baffle the immensities.  He squirms on his\ndunghill, and like a child lost in the dark among goblins, calls to the\ngods that he is their younger brother, a prisoner of the quick that is\ndestined to be as free as they--monuments of egotism reared by the\nepiphenomena; dreams and the dust of dreams, that vanish when the dreamer\nvanishes and are no more when he is not.\n\n\"It is nothing new, these vital lies men tell themselves, muttering and\nmumbling them like charms and incantations against the powers of Night.\nThe voodoos and medicine men and the devil-devil doctors were the fathers\nof metaphysics.  Night and the Noseless One were ogres that beset the way\nof light and life.  And the metaphysicians would win by if they had to\ntell lies to do it.  They were vexed by the brazen law of the Ecclesiast\nthat men die like the beasts of the field and their end is the same.\nTheir creeds were their schemes, their religions their nostrums, their\nphilosophies their devices, by which they half-believed they would outwit\nthe Noseless One and the Night.\n\n\"Bog-lights, vapours of mysticism, psychic overtones, soul orgies,\nwailings among the shadows, weird gnosticisms, veils and tissues of\nwords, gibbering subjectivisms, gropings and maunderings, ontological\nfantasies, pan-psychic hallucinations--this is the stuff, the phantasms\nof hope, that fills your bookshelves.  Look at them, all the sad wraiths\nof sad mad men and passionate rebels--your Schopenhauers, your\nStrindbergs, your Tolstois and Nietzsches.\n\n\"Come.  Your glass is empty.  Fill and forget.\"\n\nI obey, for my brain is now well a-crawl with the maggots of alcohol, and\nas I drink to the sad thinkers on my shelves I quote Richard Hovey:\n\n   \"Abstain not! Life and Love like night and day\n    Offer themselves to us on their own terms,\n    Not ours.  Accept their bounty while ye may,\n    Before we be accepted by the worms,\"\n\n\n\"I will cap you,\" cries the White Logic.\n\n\"No,\" I answer, while the maggots madden me.  \"I know you for what you\nare, and I am unafraid.  Under your mask of hedonism you are yourself the\nNoseless One and your way leads to the Night.  Hedonism has no meaning.\nIt, too, is a lie, at best the coward's smug compromise.\"\n\n\"Now will I cap you!\" the White Logic breaks in.\n\n   \"But if you would not this poor life fulfil,\n    Lo, you are free to end it when you will,\n    Without the fear of waking after death.\"\n\n\nAnd I laugh my defiance; for now, and for the moment, I know the White\nLogic to be the arch-impostor of them all, whispering his whispers of\ndeath.  And he is guilty of his own unmasking, with his own genial\nchemistry turning the tables on himself, with his own maggots biting\nalive the old illusions, resurrecting and making to sound again the old\nvoice from beyond of my youth, telling me again that still are mine the\npossibilities and powers which life and the books had taught me did not\nexist.\n\nAnd the dinner gong sounds to the reversed bottom of my glass.  Jeering\nat the White Logic, I go out to join my guests at table, and with assumed\nseriousness to discuss the current magazines and the silly doings of the\nworld's day, whipping every trick and ruse of controversy through all the\npaces of paradox and persiflage.  And, when the whim changes, it is most\neasy and delightfully disconcerting to play with the respectable and\ncowardly bourgeois fetishes and to laugh and epigram at the flitting\ngod-ghosts and the debaucheries and follies of wisdom.\n\nThe clown's the thing! The clown! If one must be a philosopher, let him\nbe Aristophanes.  And no one at the table thinks I am jingled.  I am in\nfine fettle, that is all.  I tire of the labour of thinking, and, when\nthe table is finished, start practical jokes and set all playing at\ngames, which we carry on with bucolic boisterousness.\n\nAnd when the evening is over and good-night said, I go back through my\nbook-walled den to my sleeping porch and to myself and to the White Logic\nwhich, undefeated, has never left me.  And as I fall to fuddled sleep I\nhear youth crying, as Harry Kemp heard it:\n\n   \"I heard Youth calling in the night:\n    'Gone is my former world-delight;\n    For there is naught my feet may stay;\n    The morn suffuses into day,\n    It dare not stand a moment still\n    But must the world with light fulfil.\n    More evanescent than the rose\n    My sudden rainbow comes and goes,\n    Plunging bright ends across the sky--\n    Yea, I am Youth because I die!'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nThe foregoing is a sample roaming with the White Logic through the dusk\nof my soul.\n\nTo the best of my power I have striven to give the reader a glimpse of a\nman's secret dwelling when it is shared with John Barleycorn.  And the\nreader must remember that this mood, which he has read in a quarter of an\nhour, is but one mood of the myriad moods of John Barleycorn, and that\nthe procession of such moods may well last the clock around through many\na day and week and month.\n\nMy alcoholic reminiscences draw to a close.  I can say, as any strong,\nchesty drinker can say, that all that leaves me alive to-day on the\nplanet is my unmerited luck--the luck of chest, and shoulders, and\nconstitution.  I dare to say that a not large percentage of youths, in\nthe formative stage of fifteen to seventeen, could have survived the\nstress of heavy drinking that I survived between my fifteenth and\nseventeenth years; that a not large percentage of men could have punished\nthe alcohol I have punished in my manhood years and lived to tell the\ntale.  I survived, through no personal virtue, but because I did not have\nthe chemistry of a dipsomaniac and because I possessed an organism\nunusually resistant to the ravages of John Barleycorn.  And, surviving, I\nhave watched the others die, not so lucky, down all the long sad road.\n\nIt was my unmitigated and absolute good fortune, good luck, chance, call\nit what you will, that brought me through the fires of John Barleycorn.\nMy life, my career, my joy in living, have not been destroyed.  They have\nbeen scorched, it is true; like the survivors of forlorn hopes, they have\nby unthinkably miraculous ways come through the fight to marvel at the\ntally of the slain.\n\nAnd like such a survivor of old red war who cries out, \"Let there be no\nmore war!\" so I cry out, \"Let there be no more poison-fighting by our\nyouths!\"  The way to stop war is to stop it.  The way to stop drinking is\nto stop it.  The way China stopped the general use of opium was by\nstopping the cultivation and importation of opium.  The philosophers,\npriests, and doctors of China could have preached themselves breathless\nagainst opium for a thousand years, and the use of opium, so long as\nopium was ever accessible and obtainable, would have continued unabated.\nWe are so made, that is all.\n\nWe have with great success made a practice of not leaving arsenic and\nstrychnine, and typhoid and tuberculosis germs lying around for our\nchildren to be destroyed by.  Treat John Barleycorn the same way.  Stop\nhim.  Don't let him lie around, licensed and legal, to pounce upon our\nyouth.  Not of alcoholics nor for alcoholics do I write, but for our\nyouths, for those who possess no more than the adventure-stings and the\ngenial predispositions, the social man-impulses, which are twisted all\nawry by our barbarian civilisation which feeds them poison on all the\ncorners.  It is the healthy, normal boys, now born or being born, for\nwhom I write.\n\nIt was for this reason, more than any other, and more ardently than any\nother, that I rode down into the Valley of the Moon, all a-jingle, and\nvoted for equal suffrage.  I voted that women might vote, because I knew\nthat they, the wives and mothers of the race, would vote John Barleycorn\nout of existence and back into the historical limbo of our vanished\ncustoms of savagery.  If I thus seem to cry out as one hurt, please\nremember that I have been sorely bruised and that I do dislike the\nthought that any son or daughter of mine or yours should be similarly\nbruised.\n\nThe women are the true conservators of the race.  The men are the\nwastrels, the adventure-lovers and gamblers, and in the end it is by\ntheir women that they are saved.  About man's first experiment in\nchemistry was the making of alcohol, and down all the generations to this\nday man has continued to manufacture and drink it.  And there has never\nbeen a day when the women have not resented man's use of alcohol, though\nthey have never had the power to give weight to their resentment.  The\nmoment women get the vote in any community, the first thing they proceed\nto do is to close the saloons.  In a thousand generations to come men of\nthemselves will not close the saloons.  As well expect the morphine\nvictims to legislate the sale of morphine out of existence.\n\nThe women know.  They have paid an incalculable price of sweat and tears\nfor man's use of alcohol.  Ever jealous for the race, they will legislate\nfor the babes of boys yet to be born; and for the babes of girls, too,\nfor they must be the mothers, wives, and sisters of these boys.\n\nAnd it will be easy.  The only ones that will be hurt will be the topers\nand seasoned drinkers of a single generation.  I am one of these, and I\nmake solemn assurance, based upon long traffic with John Barleycorn, that\nit won't hurt me very much to stop drinking when no one else drinks and\nwhen no drink is obtainable.  On the other hand, the overwhelming\nproportion of young men are so normally non-alcoholic, that, never having\nhad access to alcohol, they will never miss it.  They will know of the\nsaloon only in the pages of history, and they will think of the saloon as\na quaint old custom similar to bull-baiting and the burning of witches.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nOf course, no personal tale is complete without bringing the narrative of\nthe person down to the last moment.  But mine is no tale of a reformed\ndrunkard.  I was never a drunkard, and I have not reformed.\n\nIt chanced, some time ago, that I made a voyage of one hundred and\nforty-eight days in a windjammer around the Horn.  I took no private\nsupply of alcohol along, and, though there was no day of those one\nhundred and forty-eight days that I could not have got a drink from the\ncaptain, I did not take a drink.  I did not take a drink because I did\nnot desire a drink.  No one else drank on board.  The atmosphere for\ndrinking was not present, and in my system there was no organic need for\nalcohol.  My chemistry did not demand alcohol.\n\nSo there arose before me a problem, a clear and simple problem: THIS IS\nSO EASY, WHY NOT KEEP IT UP WHEN YOU GET BACK ON LAND?  I weighed this\nproblem carefully.  I weighed it for five months, in a state of absolute\nnon-contact with alcohol.  And out of the data of past experience, I\nreached certain conclusions.\n\nIn the first place, I am convinced that not one man in ten thousand or in\na hundred thousand is a genuine, chemical dipsomaniac.  Drinking, as I\ndeem it, is practically entirely a habit of mind.  It is unlike tobacco,\nor cocaine, or morphine, or all the rest of the long list of drugs.  The\ndesire for alcohol is quite peculiarly mental in its origin.  It is a\nmatter of mental training and growth, and it is cultivated in social\nsoil.  Not one drinker in a million began drinking alone.  All drinkers\nbegin socially, and this drinking is accompanied by a thousand social\nconnotations such as I have described out of my own experience in the\nfirst part of this narrative.  These social connotations are the stuff of\nwhich the drink habit is largely composed.  The part that alcohol itself\nplays is inconsiderable when compared with the part played by the social\natmosphere in which it is drunk.  The human is rarely born these days,\nwho, without long training in the social associations of drinking, feels\nthe irresistible chemical propulsion of his system toward alcohol.  I do\nassume that such rare individuals are born, but I have never encountered\none.\n\nOn this long, five-months' voyage, I found that among all my bodily needs\nnot the slightest shred of a bodily need for alcohol existed.  But this I\ndid find: my need was mental and social.  When I thought of alcohol, the\nconnotation was fellowship.  When I thought of fellowship, the\nconnotation was alcohol.  Fellowship and alcohol were Siamese twins.\nThey always occurred linked together.\n\nThus, when reading in my deck chair or when talking with others,\npractically any mention of any part of the world I knew instantly aroused\nthe connotation of drinking and good fellows.  Big nights and days and\nmoments, all purple passages and freedoms, thronged my memory.  \"Venice\"\nstares at me from the printed page, and I remember the cafe tables on the\nsidewalks.  \"The Battle of Santiago,\" some one says, and I answer, \"Yes,\nI've been over the ground.\" But I do not see the ground, nor Kettle Hill,\nnor the Peace Tree.  What I see is the Cafe Venus, on the plaza of\nSantiago, where one hot night I drank and talked with a dying consumptive.\n\nThe East End of London, I read, or some one says; and first of all, under\nmy eyelids, leap the visions of the shining pubs, and in my ears echo the\ncalls for \"two of bitter\" and \"three of Scotch.\" The Latin Quarter--at\nonce I am in the student cabarets, bright faces and keen spirits around\nme, sipping cool, well-dripped absinthe while our voices mount and soar\nin Latin fashion as we settle God and art and democracy and the rest of\nthe simple problems of existence.\n\nIn a pampero off the River Plate we speculate, if we are disabled, of\nrunning in to Buenos Ayres, the \"Paris of America,\" and I have visions of\nbright congregating places of men, of the jollity of raised glasses, and\nof song and cheer and the hum of genial voices.  When we have picked up\nthe North-east Trades in the Pacific we try to persuade our dying captain\nto run for Honolulu, and while I persuade I see myself again drinking\ncocktails on the cool lanais and fizzes out at Waikiki where the surf\nrolls in.  Some one mentions the way wild ducks are cooked in the\nrestaurants of San Francisco, and at once I am transported to the light\nand clatter of many tables, where I gaze at old friends across the golden\nbrims of long-stemmed Rhine-wine glasses.\n\nAnd so I pondered my problem.  I should not care to revisit all these\nfair places of the world except in the fashion I visited them before.\nGLASS IN HAND!  There is a magic in the phrase.  It means more than all\nthe words in the dictionary can be made to mean.  It is a habit of mind\nto which I have been trained all my life.  It is now part of the stuff\nthat composes me.  I like the bubbling play of wit, the chesty laughs,\nthe resonant voices of men, when, glass in hand, they shut the grey world\noutside and prod their brains with the fun and folly of an accelerated\npulse.\n\nNo, I decided; I shall take my drink on occasion.  With all the books on\nmy shelves, with all the thoughts of the thinkers shaded by my particular\ntemperament, I decided coolly and deliberately that I should continue to\ndo what I had been trained to want to do.  I would drink--but oh, more\nskilfully, more discreetly, than ever before.  Never again would I be a\nperipatetic conflagration.  Never again would I invoke the White Logic.\nI had learned how not to invoke him.\n\nThe White Logic now lies decently buried alongside the Long Sickness.\nNeither will afflict me again.  It is many a year since I laid the Long\nSickness away; his sleep is sound.  And just as sound is the sleep of the\nWhite Logic.  And yet, in conclusion, I can well say that I wish my\nforefathers had banished John Barleycorn before my time.  I regret that\nJohn Barleycorn flourished everywhere in the system of society in which I\nwas born, else I should not have made his acquaintance, and I was long\ntrained in his acquaintance."
