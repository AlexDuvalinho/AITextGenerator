SOME OPINIONS AND A WEDDING\n\n\n“I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,” chanted the white-robed clergyman.\n\n“'I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,'” echoed the tall young bridegroom, his\neyes gravely tender.\n\n“To my wedded wife.”\n\n“'To my wedded wife.'” The bridegroom's voice shook a little.\n\n“To have and to hold from this day forward.”\n\n“'To have and to hold from this day forward.'” Now the young voice rang\nwith triumph. It had grown strong and steady.\n\n“For better for worse.”\n\n“'For better for worse.'”\n\n“For richer for poorer,” droned the clergyman, with the weariness of\nuncounted repetitions.\n\n“'For richer for poorer,'” avowed the bridegroom, with the decisive\nemphasis of one to whom the words are new and significant.\n\n“In sickness and in health.”\n\n“'In sickness and in health.'”\n\n“To love and to cherish.”\n\n“'To love and to cherish.'” The younger voice carried infinite\ntenderness now.\n\n“Till death us do part.”\n\n“'Till death us do part,'” repeated the bridegroom's lips; but everybody\nknew that what his heart said was: “Now, and through all eternity.”\n\n“According to God's holy ordinance.”\n\n“'According to God's holy ordinance.'”\n\n“And thereto I plight thee my troth.”\n\n“'And thereto I plight thee my troth.'”\n\nThere was a faint stir in the room. In one corner a white-haired woman\nblinked tear-wet eyes and pulled a fleecy white shawl more closely about\nher shoulders. Then the minister's voice sounded again.\n\n“I, Billy, take thee, Bertram.”\n\n“'I, Billy, take thee, Bertram.'”\n\nThis time the echoing voice was a feminine one, low and sweet, but\nclearly distinct, and vibrant with joyous confidence, on through one\nafter another of the ever familiar, but ever impressive phrases of the\nservice that gives into the hands of one man and of one woman the future\nhappiness, each of the other.\n\n\nThe wedding was at noon. That evening Mrs. Kate Hartwell, sister of the\nbridegroom, wrote the following letter:\n\n\nBOSTON, July 15th.\n\n“MY DEAR HUSBAND:--Well, it's all over with, and they're married. I\ncouldn't do one thing to prevent it. Much as ever as they would even\nlisten to what I had to say--and when they knew how I had hurried East\nto say it, too, with only two hours' notice!\n\n“But then, what can you expect? From time immemorial lovers never\ndid have any sense; and when those lovers are such irresponsible\nflutterbudgets as Billy and Bertram--!\n\n“And such a wedding! I couldn't do anything with _that_, either, though\nI tried hard. They had it in Billy's living-room at noon, with nothing\nbut the sun for light. There was no maid of honor, no bridesmaids, no\nwedding cake, no wedding veil, no presents (except from the family, and\nfrom that ridiculous Chinese cook of brother William's, Ding Dong, or\nwhatever his name is. He tore in just before the wedding ceremony, and\ninsisted upon seeing Billy to give her a wretched little green stone\nidol, which he declared would bring her 'heap plenty velly good luckee'\nif she received it before she 'got married.' I wouldn't have the\nhideous, grinning thing around, but William says it's real jade, and\nvery valuable, and of course Billy was crazy over it--or pretended to\nbe). There was no trousseau, either, and no reception. There was no\nanything but the bridegroom; and when I tell you that Billy actually\ndeclared that was all she wanted, you will understand how absurdly in\nlove she is--in spite of all those weeks and weeks of broken engagement\nwhen I, at least, supposed she had come to her senses, until I got that\ncrazy note from Bertram a week ago saying they were to be married today.\n\n“I can't say that I've got any really satisfactory explanation of the\nmatter. Everything has been in such a hubbub, and those two ridiculous\nchildren have been so afraid they wouldn't be together every minute\npossible, that any really rational conversation with either of them was\nout of the question. When Billy broke the engagement last spring none of\nus knew why she had done it, as you know; and I fancy we shall be almost\nas much in the dark as to why she has--er--mended it now, as you might\nsay. As near as I can make out, however, she thought he didn't want her,\nand he thought she didn't want him. I believe matters were still further\ncomplicated by a girl Bertram was painting, and a young fellow that used\nto sing with Billy--a Mr. Arkwright.\n\n“Anyhow, things came to a head last spring, Billy broke the engagement\nand fled to parts unknown with Aunt Hannah, leaving Bertram here in\nBoston to alternate between stony despair and reckless gayety, according\nto William; and it was while he was in the latter mood that he had that\nawful automobile accident and broke his arm--and almost his neck. He was\nwildly delirious, and called continually for Billy.\n\n“Well, it seems Billy didn't know all this; but a week ago she\ncame home, and in some way found out about it, I think through\nPete--William's old butler, you know. Just exactly what happened I\ncan't say, but I do know that she dragged poor old Aunt Hannah down\nto Bertram's at some unearthly hour, and in the rain; and Aunt Hannah\ncouldn't do a thing with her. All Billy would say, was, 'Bertram wants\nme.' And Aunt Hannah told me that if I could have seen Billy's face I'd\nhave known that she'd have gone to Bertram then if he'd been at the top\nof the Himalaya Mountains, or at the bottom of the China Sea. So perhaps\nit's just as well--for Aunt Hannah's sake, at least--that he was in no\nworse place than on his own couch at home. Anyhow, she went, and in half\nan hour they blandly informed Aunt Hannah that they were going to be\nmarried to-day.\n\n“Aunt Hannah said she tried to stop that, and get them to put it off\ntill October (the original date, you know), but Bertram was obdurate.\nAnd when he declared he'd marry her the next day if it wasn't for\nthe new license law, Aunt Hannah said she gave up for fear he'd get a\nspecial dispensation, or go to the Governor or the President, or do some\nother dreadful thing. (What a funny old soul Aunt Hannah is!) Bertram\ntold _me_ that he should never feel safe till Billy was really his; that\nshe'd read something, or hear something, or think something, or get\na letter from me (as if anything _I_ could say would do any good-or\nharm!), and so break the engagement again.\n\n“Well, she's his now, so I suppose he's satisfied; though, for my part,\nI haven't changed my mind at all. I still say that they are not one bit\nsuited to each other, and that matrimony will simply ruin his career.\nBertram never has loved and never will love any girl long--except to\npaint. But if he simply _would_ get married, why couldn't he have taken\na nice, sensible domestic girl that would have kept him fed and mended?\n\n“Not but that I'm very fond of Billy, as you know, dear; but imagine\nBilly as a wife--worse yet, a mother! Billy's a dear girl, but she knows\nabout as much of real life and its problems as--as our little Kate. A\nmore impulsive, irresponsible, regardless-of-consequences young woman\nI never saw. She can play divinely, and write delightful songs, I'll\nacknowledge; but what is that when a man is hungry, or has lost a\nbutton?\n\n“Billy has had her own way, and had everything she wanted for years\nnow--a rather dangerous preparation for marriage, especially marriage\nto a fellow like Bertram who has had _his_ own way and everything _he's_\nwanted for years. Pray, what's going to happen when those ways conflict,\nand neither one gets the thing wanted?\n\n“And think of her ignorance of cooking--but, there! What's the use?\nThey're married now, and it can't be helped.\n\n“Mercy, what a letter I've written! But I, had to talk to some one;\nbesides, I'd promised I to let you know how matters stood as soon as I\ncould. As you see, though, my trip East has been practically useless. I\nsaw the wedding, to be sure, but I didn't prevent it, or even postpone\nit--though I meant to do one or the other, else I should never have made\nthat tiresome journey half across the continent at two hours' notice.\n\n“However, we shall see what we shall see. As for me, I'm dead tired.\nGood night.\n\n“Affectionately yours,\n\n“KATE.”\n\n\nQuite naturally, Mrs. Kate Hartwell was not the only one who was\nthinking that evening of the wedding. In the home of Bertram's brother\nCyril, Cyril himself was at the piano, but where his thoughts were was\nplain to be seen--or rather, heard; for from under his fingers there\ncame the Lohengrin wedding march until all the room seemed filled with\nthe scent of orange blossoms, the mistiness of floating veils, and the\nechoing peals of far-away organs heralding the “Fair Bride and Groom.”\n\nOver by the table in the glowing circle of the shaded lamp, sat Marie,\nCyril's wife, a dainty sewing-basket by her side. Her hands, however,\nlay idly across the stocking in her lap.\n\nAs the music ceased, she drew a long sigh.\n\nWhat a perfectly beautiful wedding that was! she breathed.\n\nCyril whirled about on the piano stool.\n\n“It was a very sensible wedding,” he said with emphasis.\n\n“They looked so happy--both of them,” went on Marie, dreamily; “so--so\nsort of above and beyond everything about them, as if nothing ever, ever\ncould trouble them--_now_.”\n\nCyril lifted his eyebrows.\n\n“Humph! Well, as I said before, it was a very _sensible_ wedding,” he\ndeclared.\n\nThis time Marie noticed the emphasis. She laughed, though her eyes\nlooked a little troubled.\n\n“I know, dear, of course, what you mean. _I_ thought our wedding was\nbeautiful; but I would have made it simpler if I'd realized in time how\nyou--you--”\n\n“How I abhorred pink teas and purple pageants,” he finished for her,\nwith a frowning smile. “Oh, well, I stood it--for the sake of what it\nbrought me.” His face showed now only the smile; the frown had vanished.\nFor a man known for years to his friends as a “hater of women and all\nother confusion,” Cyril Henshaw was looking remarkably well-pleased with\nhimself.\n\nHis wife of less than a year colored as she met his gaze. Hurriedly she\npicked up her needle.\n\nThe man laughed happily at her confusion.\n\n“What are you doing? Is that my stocking?” he demanded.\n\nA look, half pain, half reproach, crossed her face.\n\n“Why, Cyril, of course not! You--you told me not to, long ago. You said\nmy darns made--bunches.\n\n“Ho! I meant I didn't want to _wear_ them,” retorted the man, upon whom\nthe tragic wretchedness of that half-sobbed “bunches” had been quite\nlost. “I love to see you _mending_ them,” he finished, with an approving\nglance at the pretty little picture of domesticity before him.\n\nA peculiar expression came to Marie's eyes.\n\n“Why, Cyril, you mean you _like_ to have me mend them just for--for the\nsake of seeing me do it, when you _know_ you won't ever wear them?”\n\n“Sure!” nodded the man, imperturbably. Then, with a sudden laugh, he\nasked: “I wonder now, does Billy love to mend socks?”\n\nMarie smiled, but she sighed, too, and shook her head.\n\n“I'm afraid not, Cyril.”\n\n“Nor cook?”\n\nMarie laughed outright this time. The vaguely troubled look had fled\nfrom her eyes\n\n“Oh, Billy's helped me beat eggs and butter sometimes, but I never knew\nher to cook a thing or want to cook a thing, but once; then she spent\nnearly two weeks trying to learn to make puddings--for you.”\n\n“For _me!_”\n\nMarie puckered her lips queerly.\n\n“Well, I supposed they were for you at the time. At all events she was\ntrying to make them for some one of you boys; probably it was really for\nBertram, though.”\n\n“Humph!” grunted Cyril. Then, after a minute, he observed: “I judge Kate\nthinks Billy'll never make them--for anybody. I'm afraid Sister Kate\nisn't pleased.”\n\n“Oh, but Mrs. Hartwell was--was disappointed in the wedding,” apologized\nMarie, quickly. “You know she wanted it put off anyway, and she didn't\nlike such a simple one.\n\n“Hm-m; as usual Sister Kate forgot it wasn't her funeral--I mean, her\nwedding,” retorted Cyril, dryly. “Kate is never happy, you know, unless\nshe's managing things.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” nodded Marie, with a frowning smile of recollection at\ncertain features of her own wedding.\n\n“She doesn't approve of Billy's taste in guests, either,” remarked\nCyril, after a moment's silence.\n\n“I thought her guests were lovely,” spoke up Marie, in quick defense.\n“Of course, most of her social friends are away--in July; but Billy is\nnever a society girl, you know, in spite of the way Society is always\ntrying to lionize her and Bertram.”\n\n“Oh, of course Kate knows that; but she says it seems as if Billy\nneedn't have gone out and gathered in the lame and the halt and the\nblind.”\n\n“Nonsense!” cried Marie, with unusual sharpness for her. “I suppose she\nsaid that just because of Mrs. Greggory's and Tommy Dunn's crutches.”\n\n“Well, they didn't make a real festive-looking wedding party, you must\nadmit,” laughed Cyril; “what with the bridegroom's own arm in a sling,\ntoo! But who were they all, anyway?”\n\n“Why, you knew Mrs. Greggory and Alice, of course--and Pete,” smiled\nMarie. “And wasn't Pete happy? Billy says she'd have had Pete if she had\nno one else; that there wouldn't have been any wedding, anyway, if it\nhadn't been for his telephoning Aunt Hannah that night.”\n\n“Yes; Will told me.”\n\n“As for Tommy and the others--most of them were those people that Billy\nhad at her home last summer for a two weeks' vacation--people, you\nknow, too poor to give themselves one, and too proud to accept one from\nordinary charity. Billy's been following them up and doing little things\nfor them ever since--sugarplums and frosting on their cake, she calls\nit; and they adore her, of course. I think it was lovely of her to have\nthem, and they did have such a good time! You should have seen Tommy\nwhen you played that wedding march for Billy to enter the room. His poor\nlittle face was so transfigured with joy that I almost cried, just to\nlook at him. Billy says he loves music--poor little fellow!”\n\n“Well, I hope they'll be happy, in spite of Kate's doleful prophecies.\nCertainly they looked happy enough to-day,” declared Cyril, patting a\nyawn as he rose to his feet. “I fancy Will and Aunt Hannah are lonesome,\nthough, about now,” he added.\n\n“Yes,” smiled Marie, mistily, as she gathered up her work. “I know what\nAunt Hannah's doing. She's helping Rosa put the house to rights, and\nshe's stopping to cry over every slipper and handkerchief of Billy's she\nfinds. And she'll do that until that funny clock of hers strikes twelve,\nthen she'll say 'Oh, my grief and conscience--midnight!' But the next\nminute she'll remember that it's only half-past eleven, after all, and\nshe'll send Rosa to bed and sit patting Billy's slipper in her lap till\nit really is midnight by all the other clocks.”\n\nCyril laughed appreciatively.\n\n“Well, I know what Will is doing,” he declared.\n\n“Will is in Bertram's den dozing before the fireplace with Spunkie\ncurled up in his lap.”\n\nAs it happened, both these surmises were not far from right. In the\nStrata, the Henshaws' old Beacon Street home, William was sitting before\nthe fireplace with the cat in his lap, but he was not dozing. He was\ntalking.\n\n“Spunkie,” he was saying, “your master, Bertram, got married to-day--and\nto Miss Billy. He'll be bringing her home one of these days--your new\nmistress. And such a mistress! Never did cat or house have a better!\n\n“Just think; for the first time in years this old place is to know the\ntouch of a woman's hand--and that's what it hasn't known for almost\ntwenty years, except for those few short months six years ago when\na dark-eyed girl and a little gray kitten (that was Spunk, your\npredecessor, you know) blew in and blew out again before we scarcely\nknew they were here. That girl was Miss Billy, and she was a dear then,\njust as she is now, only now she's coming here to stay. She's coming\nhome, Spunkie; and she'll make it a home for you, for me, and for all of\nus. Up to now, you know, it hasn't really been a home, for years--just\nus men, so. It'll be very different, Spunkie, as you'll soon find out.\nNow mind, madam! We must show that we appreciate all this: no tempers,\nno tantrums, no showing of claws, no leaving our coats--either yours or\nmine--on the drawing-room chairs, no tracking in of mud on clean rugs\nand floors! For we're going to have a home, Spunkie--a home!”\n\nAt Hillside, Aunt Hannah was, indeed, helping Rosa to put the house to\nrights, as Marie had said. She was crying, too, over a glove she had\nfound on Billy's piano; but she was crying over something else, also.\nNot only had she lost Billy, but she had lost her home.\n\nTo be sure, nothing had been said during that nightmare of a week of\nhurry and confusion about Aunt Hannah's future; but Aunt Hannah knew\nvery well how it must be. This dear little house on the side of Corey\nHill was Billy's home, and Billy would not need it any longer. It\nwould be sold, of course; and she, Aunt Hannah, would go back to a\n“second-story front” and loneliness in some Back Bay boarding-house; and\na second story front and loneliness would not be easy now, after these\nyears of home--and Billy.\n\nNo wonder, indeed, that Aunt Hannah sat crying and patting the little\nwhite glove in her hand. No wonder, too, that--being Aunt Hannah--she\nreached for the shawl near by and put it on, shiveringly. Even July,\nto-night, was cold--to Aunt Hannah.\n\nIn yet another home that evening was the wedding of Billy Neilson and\nBertram Henshaw uppermost in thought and speech. In a certain little\nSouth-End flat where, in two rented rooms, lived Alice Greggory and\nher crippled mother, Alice was talking to Mr. M. J. Arkwright, commonly\nknown to his friends as “Mary Jane,” owing to the mystery in which he\nhad for so long shrouded his name.\n\nArkwright to-night was plainly moody and ill at ease.\n\n“You're not listening. You're not listening at all,” complained Alice\nGreggory at last, reproachfully.\n\nWith a visible effort the man roused himself.\n\n“Indeed I am,” he maintained.\n\n“I thought you'd be interested in the wedding. You used to be\nfriends--you and Billy.” The girl's voice still vibrated with reproach.\n\nThere was a moment's silence; then, a little harshly, the man said:\n\n“Perhaps--because I wanted to be more than--a friend--is why you're not\nsatisfied with my interest now.”\n\nA look that was almost terror came to Alice Greggory's eyes. She flushed\npainfully, then grew very white.\n\n“You mean--”\n\n“Yes,” he nodded dully, without looking up. “I cared too much for her. I\nsupposed Henshaw was just a friend--till too late.”\n\nThere was a breathless hush before, a little unsteadily, the girl\nstammered:\n\n“Oh, I'm so sorry--so very sorry! I--I didn't know.”\n\n“No, of course you didn't. I've almost told you, though, lots of times;\nyou've been so good to me all these weeks.” He raised his head now, and\nlooked at her, frank comradeship in his eyes.\n\nThe girl stirred restlessly. Her eyes swerved a little under his level\ngaze.\n\n“Oh, but I've done nothing--n-nothing,” she stammered. Then, at the\nlight tap of crutches on a bare floor she turned in obvious relief. “Oh,\nhere's mother. She's been in visiting with Mrs. Delano, our landlady.\nMother, Mr. Arkwright is here.”\n\n\nMeanwhile, speeding north as fast as steam could carry them, were the\nbride and groom. The wondrousness of the first hour of their journey\nside by side had become a joyous certitude that always it was to be like\nthis now.\n\n“Bertram,” began the bride, after a long minute of eloquent silence.\n\n“Yes, love.”\n\n“You know our wedding was very different from most weddings.”\n\n“Of course it was!”\n\n“Yes, but _really_ it was. Now listen.” The bride's voice grew tenderly\nearnest. “I think our marriage is going to be different, too.”\n\n“Different?”\n\n“Yes.” Billy's tone was emphatic. “There are so many common, everyday\nmarriages where--where--Why, Bertram, as if you could ever be to me\nlike--like Mr. Carleton is, for instance!”\n\n“Like Mr. Carleton is--to you?” Bertram's voice was frankly puzzled.\n\n“No, no! As Mr. Carleton is to Mrs. Carleton, I mean.”\n\n“Oh!” Bertram subsided in relief.\n\n“And the Grahams and Whartons, and the Freddie Agnews, and--and a lot\nof others. Why, Bertram, I've seen the Grahams and the Whartons not even\nspeak to each other a whole evening, when they've been at a dinner, or\nsomething; and I've seen Mrs. Carleton not even seem to know her husband\ncame into the room. I don't mean quarrel, dear. Of course we'd never\n_quarrel!_ But I mean I'm sure we shall never get used to--to you being\nyou, and I being I.”\n\n“Indeed we sha'n't,” agreed Bertram, rapturously.\n\n“Ours is going to be such a beautiful marriage!”\n\n“Of course it will be.”\n\n“And we'll be so happy!”\n\n“I shall be, and I shall try to make you so.”\n\n“As if I could be anything else,” sighed Billy, blissfully. “And now we\n_can't_ have any misunderstandings, you see.”\n\n“Of course not. Er--what's that?”\n\n“Why, I mean that--that we can't ever repeat hose miserable weeks of\nmisunderstanding. Everything is all explained up. I _know_, now, that\nyou don't love Miss Winthrop, or just girls--any girl--to paint. You\nlove me. Not the tilt of my chin, nor the turn of my head; but _me_.”\n\n“I do--just you.” Bertram's eyes gave the caress his lips would have\ngiven had it not been for the presence of the man in the seat across the\naisle of the sleeping-car.\n\n“And you--you know now that I love you--just you?”\n\n“Not even Arkwright?”\n\n“Not even Arkwright,” smiled Billy.\n\nThere was the briefest of hesitations; then, a little constrainedly,\nBertram asked:\n\n“And you said you--you never _had_ cared for Arkwright, didn't you?”\n\nFor the second time in her life Billy was thankful that Bertram's\nquestion had turned upon _her_ love for Arkwright, not Arkwright's love\nfor her. In Billy's opinion, a man's unrequited love for a girl was his\nsecret, not hers, and was certainly one that the girl had no right\nto tell. Once before Bertram had asked her if she had ever cared for\nArkwright, and then she had answered emphatically, as she did now:\n\n“Never, dear.”\n\n“I thought you said so,” murmured Bertram, relaxing a little.\n\n“I did; besides, didn't I tell you?” she went on airily, “I think he'll\nmarry Alice Greggory. Alice wrote me all the time I was away, and--oh,\nshe didn't say anything definite, I'll admit,” confessed Billy, with\nan arch smile; “but she spoke of his being there lots, and they used to\nknow each other years ago, you see. There was almost a romance there,\nI think, before the Greggorys lost their money and moved away from all\ntheir friends.”\n\n“Well, he may have her. She's a nice girl--a mighty nice girl,” answered\nBertram, with the unmistakably satisfied air of the man who knows he\nhimself possesses the nicest girl of them all.\n\nBilly, reading unerringly the triumph in his voice, grew suddenly\ngrave. She regarded her husband with a thoughtful frown; then she drew a\nprofound sigh.\n\n“Whew!” laughed Bertram, whimsically. “So soon as this?”\n\n“Bertram!” Billy's voice was tragic.\n\n“Yes, my love.” The bridegroom pulled his face into sobriety; then Billy\nspoke, with solemn impressiveness.\n\n“Bertram, I don't know a thing about--cooking--except what I've been\nlearning in Rosa's cook-book this last week.”\n\nBertram laughed so loud that the man across the aisle glanced over the\ntop of his paper surreptitiously.\n\n“Rosa's cook-book! Is that what you were doing all this week?”\n\n“Yes; that is--I tried so hard to learn something,” stammered Billy.\n“But I'm afraid I didn't--much; there were so many things for me to\nthink of, you know, with only a week. I believe I _could_ make peach\nfritters, though. They were the last thing I studied.”\n\nBertram laughed again, uproariously; but, at Billy's unchangingly tragic\nface, he grew suddenly very grave and tender.\n\n“Billy, dear, I didn't marry you to--to get a cook,” he said gently.\n\nBilly shook her head.\n\n“I know; but Aunt Hannah said that even if I never expected to cook,\nmyself, I ought to know how it was done, so to properly oversee it. She\nsaid that--that no woman, who didn't know how to cook and keep house\nproperly, had any business to be a wife. And, Bertram, I did try,\nhonestly, all this week. I tried so hard to remember when you sponged\nbread and when you kneaded it.”\n\n“I don't ever need--_yours_,” cut in Bertram, shamelessly; but he got\nonly a deservedly stern glance in return.\n\n“And I repeated over and over again how many cupfuls of flour and\npinches of salt and spoonfuls of baking-powder went into things; but,\nBertram, I simply could not keep my mind on it. Everything, everywhere\nwas singing to me. And how do you suppose I could remember how many\npinches of flour and spoonfuls of salt and cupfuls of baking-powder went\ninto a loaf of cake when all the while the very teakettle on the stove\nwas singing: 'It's all right--Bertram loves me--I'm going to marry\nBertram!'?”\n\n“You darling!” (In spite of the man across the aisle Bertram did\nalmost kiss her this time.) “As if anybody cared how many cupfuls of\nbaking-powder went anywhere--with that in your heart!”\n\n“Aunt Hannah says you will--when you're hungry. And Kate said--”\n\nBertram uttered a sharp word behind his teeth.\n\n“Billy, for heaven's sake don't tell me what Kate said, if you want me\nto stay sane, and not attempt to fight somebody--broken arm, and all.\nKate _thinks_ she's kind, and I suppose she means well; but--well, she's\nmade trouble enough between us already. I've got you now, sweetheart.\nYou're mine--all mine--” his voice shook, and dropped to a tender\nwhisper--“'till death us do part.'”\n\n“Yes; 'till death us do part,'” breathed Billy.\n\nAnd then, for a time, they fell silent.\n\n“'I, Bertram, take thee, Billy,'” sang the whirring wheels beneath them,\nto one.\n\n“'I, Billy, take thee, Bertram,'” sang the whirring wheels beneath them,\nto the other. While straight ahead before them both, stretched fair and\nbeautiful in their eyes, the wondrous path of life which they were to\ntread together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. FOR WILLIAM--A HOME\n\n\nOn the first Sunday after the wedding Pete came up-stairs to tell\nhis master, William, that Mrs. Stetson wanted to see him in the\ndrawing-room.\n\nWilliam went down at once.\n\n“Well, Aunt Hannah,” he began, reaching out a cordial hand. “Why, what's\nthe matter?” he broke off concernedly, as he caught a clearer view of\nthe little old lady's drawn face and troubled eyes.\n\n“William, it's silly, of course,” cried Aunt Hannah, tremulously, “but\nI simply had to go to some one. I--I feel so nervous and unsettled!\nDid--did Billy say anything to you--what she was going to do?”\n\n“What she was going to do? About what? What do you mean?”\n\n“About the house--selling it,” faltered Aunt Hannah, sinking wearily\nback into her chair.\n\nWilliam frowned thoughtfully.\n\n“Why, no,” he answered. “It was all so hurried at the last, you know.\nThere was really very little chance to make plans for anything--except\nthe wedding,” he finished, with a smile.\n\n“Yes, I know,” sighed Aunt Hannah. “Everything was in such confusion!\nStill, I didn't know but she might have said something--to you.”\n\n“No, she didn't. But I imagine it won't be hard to guess what she'll do.\nWhen they get back from their trip I fancy she won't lose much time in\nhaving what things she wants brought down here. Then she'll sell the\nrest and put the house on the market.”\n\n“Yes, of--of course,” stammered Aunt Hannah, pulling herself hastily to\na more erect position. “That's what I thought, too. Then don't you think\nwe'd better dismiss Rosa and close the house at once?”\n\n“Why--yes, perhaps so. Why not? Then you'd be all settled here when she\ncomes home. I'm sure, the sooner you come, the better I'll be pleased,”\n he smiled.\n\nAunt Hannah turned sharply.\n\n“Here!” she ejaculated. “William Henshaw, you didn't suppose I was\ncoming _here_ to live, did you?”\n\nIt was William's turn to look amazed.\n\n“Why, of course you're coming here! Where else should you go, pray?”\n\n“Where I was before--before Billy came--to you,” returned Aunt Hannah a\nlittle tremulously, but with a certain dignity. “I shall take a room in\nsome quiet boarding-house, of course.”\n\n“Nonsense, Aunt Hannah! As if Billy would listen to that! You came\nbefore; why not come now?”\n\nAunt Hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch.\n\n“You forget. I was needed before. Billy is a married woman now. She\nneeds no chaperon.”\n\n“Nonsense!” scowled William, again. “Billy will always need you.”\n\nAunt Hannah shook her head mournfully.\n\n“I like to think--she wants me, William, but I know, in my heart, it\nisn't best.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\nThere was a moment's pause; then, decisively came the answer.\n\n“Because I think young married folks should not have outsiders in the\nhome.”\n\nWilliam laughed relievedly.\n\n“Oh, so that's it! Well, Aunt Hannah, you're no outsider. Come, run\nright along home and pack your trunk.”\n\nAunt Hannah was plainly almost crying; but she held her ground.\n\n“William, I can't,” she reiterated.\n\n“But--Billy is such a child, and--”\n\nFor once in her circumspect life Aunt Hannah was guilty of an\ninterruption.\n\n“Pardon me, William, she is not a child. She is a woman now, and she has\na woman's problems to meet.”\n\n“Well, then, why don't you help her meet them?” retorted William, still\nwith a whimsical smile.\n\nBut Aunt Hannah did not smile. For a minute she did not speak; then,\nwith her eyes studiously averted, she said:\n\n“William, the first four years of my married life were--were spoiled by\nan outsider in our home. I don't mean to spoil Billy's.”\n\nWilliam relaxed visibly. The smile fled from his face.\n\n“Why--Aunt--Hannah!” he exclaimed.\n\nThe little old lady turned with a weary sigh.\n\n“Yes, I know. You are shocked, of course. I shouldn't have told you.\nStill, it is all past long ago, and--I wanted to make you understand\nwhy I can't come. He was my husband's eldest brother--a bachelor. He\nwas good and kind, and meant well, I suppose; but--he interfered with\neverything. I was young, and probably headstrong. At all events, there\nwas constant friction. He went away once and stayed two whole months. I\nshall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for\nus, with the whole house to ourselves. No, William, I can't come.” She\nrose abruptly and turned toward the door. Her eyes were wistful, and\nher face was still drawn with suffering; but her whole frail little self\nquivered plainly with high resolve. “John has Peggy outside. I must go.”\n\n“But--but, Aunt Hannah,” began William, helplessly.\n\nShe lifted a protesting hand.\n\n“No, don't urge me, please. I can't come here. But--I believe I won't\nclose the house till Billy gets home, after all,” she declared. The\nnext moment she was gone, and William, dazedly, from the doorway, was\nwatching John help her into Billy's automobile, called by Billy and half\nher friends, “Peggy,” short for “Pegasus.”\n\nStill dazedly William turned back into the house and dropped himself\ninto the nearest chair.\n\nWhat a curious call it had been! Aunt Hannah had not acted like herself\nat all. Not once had she said “Oh, my grief and conscience!” while the\nthings she _had_ said--! Someway, he had never thought of Aunt Hannah as\nbeing young, and a bride. Still, of course she must have been--once. And\nthe reason she gave for not coming there to live--the pitiful story\nof that outsider in her home! But she was no outsider! She was no\ninterfering brother of Billy's--\n\nWilliam caught his breath suddenly, and held it suspended. Then he gave\na low ejaculation and half sprang from his chair.\n\nSpunkie, disturbed from her doze by the fire, uttered a purring\n“me-o-ow,” and looked up inquiringly.\n\nFor a long minute William gazed dumbly into the cat's yellow, sleepily\ncontented eyes; then he said with tragic distinctness:\n\n“Spunkie, it's true: Aunt Hannah isn't Billy's husband's brother, but--I\nam! Do you hear? I _am!_”\n\n“Pur-r-me-ow!” commented Spunkie; and curled herself for another nap.\n\nThere was no peace for William after that. In vain he told himself that\nhe was no “interfering” brother, and that this was his home and had been\nall his life; in vain did he declare emphatically that he could not go,\nhe would not go; that Billy would not wish him to go: always before his\neyes was the vision of that little bride of years long gone; always in\nhis ears was the echo of Aunt Hannah's “I shall never forget the utter\nfreedom and happiness of those months for us, with the whole house to\nourselves.” Nor, turn which way he would, could he find anything to\ncomfort him. Simply because he was so fearfully looking for it, he found\nit--the thing that had for its theme the wretchedness that might be\nexpected from the presence of a third person in the new home.\n\nPoor William! Everywhere he met it--the hint, the word, the story, the\nsong, even; and always it added its mite to the woeful whole. Even the\nhoariest of mother-in-law jokes had its sting for him; and, to make his\ncup quite full, he chanced to remember one day what Marie had said when\nhe had suggested that she and Cyril come to the Strata to live: “No; I\nthink young folks should begin by themselves.”\n\nUnhappy, indeed, were these days for William. Like a lost spirit he\nwandered from room to room, touching this, fingering that. For long\nminutes he would stand before some picture, or some treasured bit of old\nmahogany, as if to stamp indelibly upon his mind a thing that was soon\nto be no more. At other times, like a man without a home, he would\ngo out into the Common or the Public Garden and sit for hours on some\nbench--thinking.\n\nAll this could have but one ending, of course. Before the middle of\nAugust William summoned Pete to his rooms.\n\n“Oh, Pete, I'm going to move next week,” he began nonchalantly. His\nvoice sounded as if moving were a pleasurable circumstance that occurred\nin his life regularly once a month. “I'd like you to begin to pack up\nthese things, please, to-morrow.”\n\nThe old servant's mouth fell open.\n\n“You're goin' to--to what, sir?” he stammered.\n\n“Move--_move_, I said.” William spoke with unusual harshness.\n\nPete wet his lips.\n\n“You mean you've sold the old place, sir?--that we--we ain't goin' to\nlive here no longer?”\n\n“Sold? Of course not! _I'm_ going to move away; not you.”\n\nIf Pete could have known what caused the sharpness in his master's\nvoice, he would not have been so grieved--or, rather, he would have\nbeen grieved for a different reason. As it was he could only falter\nmiserably:\n\n“_You_ are goin' to move away from here!”\n\n“Yes, yes, man! Why, Pete, what ails you? One would think a body never\nmoved before.”\n\n“They didn't--not you, sir.”\n\nWilliam turned abruptly, so that his face could not be seen. With stern\ndeliberation he picked up an elaborately decorated teapot; but the\nvaluable bit of Lowestoft shook so in his hand that he set it down at\nonce. It clicked sharply against its neighbor, betraying his nervous\nhand.\n\nPete stirred.\n\n“But, Mr. William,” he stammered thickly; “how are you--what'll you do\nwithout--There doesn't nobody but me know so well about your tea, and\nthe two lumps in your coffee; and there's your flannels that you never\nput on till I get 'em out, and the woolen socks that you'd wear all\nsummer if I didn't hide 'em. And--and who's goin' to take care of\nthese?” he finished, with a glance that encompassed the overflowing\ncabinets and shelves of curios all about him.\n\nHis master smiled sadly. An affection that had its inception in his\nboyhood days shone in his eyes. The hand in which the Lowestoft had\nshaken rested now heavily on an old man's bent shoulder--a shoulder that\nstraightened itself in unconscious loyalty under the touch.\n\n“Pete, you have spoiled me, and no mistake. I don't expect to find\nanother like you. But maybe if I wear the woolen socks too late you'll\ncome and hunt up the others for me. Eh?” And, with a smile that was\nmeant to be quizzical, William turned and began to shift the teapots\nabout again.\n\n“But, Mr. William, why--that is, what will Mr. Bertram and Miss Billy\ndo--without you?” ventured the old man.\n\nThere was a sudden tinkling crash. On the floor lay the fragments of a\nsilver-luster teapot.\n\nThe servant exclaimed aloud in dismay, but his master did not even\nglance toward his once treasured possession on the floor.\n\n“Nonsense, Pete!” he was saying in a particularly cheery voice. “Have\nyou lived all these years and not found out that newly-married folks\ndon't _need_ any one else around? Come, do you suppose we could begin\nto pack these teapots to-night?” he added, a little feverishly. “Aren't\nthere some boxes down cellar?”\n\n“I'll see, sir,” said Pete, respectfully; but the expression on his face\nas he turned away showed that he was not thinking of teapots--nor of\nboxes in which to pack them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. BILLY SPEAKS HER MIND\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw were expected home the first of September.\nBy the thirty-first of August the old Beacon Street homestead facing\nthe Public Garden was in spick-and-span order, with Dong Ling in the\nbasement hovering over a well-stocked larder, and Pete searching the\nrest of the house for a chair awry, or a bit of dust undiscovered.\n\nTwice before had the Strata--as Bertram long ago dubbed the home of\nhis boyhood--been prepared for the coming of Billy, William's namesake:\nonce, when it had been decorated with guns and fishing-rods to welcome\nthe “boy” who turned out to be a girl; and again when with pink roses\nand sewing-baskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a feminine\nBilly who did not even come at all.\n\nThe house had been very different then. It had been, indeed, a “strata,”\n with its distinctive layers of fads and pursuits as represented by\nBertram and his painting on one floor, William and his curios on\nanother, and Cyril with his music on a third. Cyril was gone now. Only\nPete and his humble belongings occupied the top floor. The floor below,\ntoo, was silent now, and almost empty save for a rug or two, and a few\npieces of heavy furniture that William had not cared to take with him\nto his new quarters on top of Beacon Hill. Below this, however, came\nBilly's old rooms, and on these Pete had lavished all his skill and\ndevotion.\n\nFreshly laundered curtains were at the windows, dustless rugs were on\nthe floor. The old work-basket had been brought down from the top-floor\nstoreroom, and the long-closed piano stood invitingly open. In\na conspicuous place, also, sat the little green god, upon whose\nexquisitely carved shoulders was supposed to rest the “heap plenty velly\ngood luckee” of Dong Ling's prophecy.\n\nOn the first floor Bertram's old rooms and the drawing-room came in for\ntheir share of the general overhauling. Even Spunkie did not escape, but\nhad to submit to the ignominy of a bath. And then dawned fair and clear\nthe first day of September, bringing at five o'clock the bride and\ngroom.\n\nRespectfully lined up in the hall to meet them were Pete and Dong Ling:\nPete with his wrinkled old face alight with joy and excitement; Dong\nLing grinning and kotowing, and chanting in a high-pitched treble:\n\n“Miss Billee, Miss Billee--plenty much welcome, Miss Billee!”\n\n“Yes, welcome home, Mrs. _Henshaw!_” bowed Bertram, turning at the door,\nwith an elaborate flourish that did not in the least hide his tender\npride in his new wife.\n\nBilly laughed and colored a pretty pink.\n\n“Thank you--all of you,” she cried a little unsteadily. “And how good,\ngood everything does look to me! Why, where's Uncle William?” she broke\noff, casting hurriedly anxious eyes about her.\n\n“Well, I should say so,” echoed Bertram. “Where is he, Pete? He isn't\nsick, is he?”\n\nA quick change crossed the old servant's face. He shook his head dumbly.\n\nBilly gave a gleeful laugh.\n\n“I know--he's asleep!” she caroled, skipping to the bottom of the\nstairway and looking up.\n\n“Ho, Uncle William! Better wake up, sir. The folks have come!”\n\nPete cleared his throat.\n\n“Mr. William isn't here, Miss--ma'am,” he corrected miserably.\n\nBilly smiled, but she frowned, too.\n\n“Not here! Well, I like that,” she pouted; “--and when I've brought him\nthe most beautiful pair of mirror knobs he ever saw, and all the way\nin my bag, too, so I could give them to him the very first thing,” she\nadded, darting over to the small bag she had brought in with her. “I'm\nglad I did, too, for our trunks didn't come,” she continued laughingly.\n“Still, if he isn't here to receive them--There, Pete, aren't they\nbeautiful?” she cried, carefully taking from their wrappings two\nexquisitely decorated porcelain discs mounted on two long spikes.\n“They're Batterseas--the real article. I know enough for that; and\nthey're finer than anything he's got. Won't he be pleased?”\n\n“Yes, Miss--ma'am, I mean,” stammered the old man.\n\n“These new titles come hard, don't they, Pete?” laughed Bertram.\n\nPete smiled faintly.\n\n“Never mind, Pete,” soothed his new mistress. “You shall call me 'Miss\nBilly' all your life if you want to. Bertram,” she added, turning to\nher husband, “I'm going to just run up-stairs and put these in Uncle\nWilliam's rooms so they'll be there when he comes in. We'll see how soon\nhe discovers them!”\n\nBefore Pete could stop her she was half-way up the first flight of\nstairs. Even then he tried to speak to his young master, to explain\nthat Mr. William was not living there; but the words refused to come. He\ncould only stand dumbly waiting.\n\nIn a minute it came--Billy's sharp, startled cry.\n\n“Bertram! Bertram!”\n\nBertram sprang for the stairway, but he had not reached the top when he\nmet his wife coming down. She was white-faced and trembling.\n\n“Bertram--those rooms--there's not so much as a teapot there! Uncle\nWilliam's--gone!”\n\n“Gone!” Bertram wheeled sharply. “Pete, what is the meaning of this?\nWhere is my brother?” To hear him, one would think he suspected the old\nservant of having hidden his master.\n\nPete lifted a shaking hand and fumbled with his collar.\n\n“He's moved, sir.”\n\n“Moved! Oh, you mean to other rooms--to Cyril's.” Bertram relaxed\nvisibly. “He's upstairs, maybe.”\n\nPete shook his head.\n\n“No, sir. He's moved away--out of the house, sir.”\n\nFor a brief moment Bertram stared as if he could not believe what his\nears had heard. Then, step by step, he began to descend the stairs.\n\n“Do you mean--to say--that my brother--has moved-gone away--_left_--his\n_home?_” he demanded.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nBilly gave a low cry.\n\n“But why--why?” she choked, almost stumbling headlong down the stairway\nin her effort to reach the two men at the bottom. “Pete, why did he go?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Pete,”--Bertram's voice was very sharp--“what is the meaning of this?\nDo you know why my brother left his home?”\n\nThe old man wet his lips and swallowed chokingly, but he did not speak.\n\n“I'm waiting, Pete.”\n\nBilly laid one hand on the old servant's arm--in the other hand she\nstill tightly clutched the mirror knobs.\n\n“Pete, if you do know, won't you tell us, please?” she begged.\n\nPete looked down at the hand, then up at the troubled young face with\nthe beseeching eyes. His own features worked convulsively. With a\nvisible effort he cleared his throat.\n\n“I know--what he said,” he stammered, his eyes averted.\n\n“What was it?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Look here, Pete, you'll have to tell us, you know,” cut in Bertram,\ndecisively, “so you might as well do it now as ever.”\n\nOnce more Pete cleared his throat. This time the words came in a burst\nof desperation.\n\n“Yes, sir. I understand, sir. It was only that he said--he said as how\nyoung folks didn't _need_ any one else around. So he was goin'.”\n\n“Didn't _need_ any one else!” exclaimed Bertram, plainly not\ncomprehending.\n\n“Yes, sir. You two bein' married so, now.” Pete's eyes were still\naverted.\n\nBilly gave a low cry.\n\n“You mean--because _I_ came?” she demanded.\n\n“Why, yes, Miss--no--that is--” Pete stopped with an appealing glance at\nBertram.\n\n“Then it was--it _was_--on account of _me_,” choked Billy.\n\nPete looked still more distressed\n\n“No, no!” he faltered. “It was only that he thought you wouldn't want\nhim here now.”\n\n“Want him here!” ejaculated Bertram.\n\n“Want him here!” echoed Billy, with a sob.\n\n“Pete, where is he?” As she asked the question she dropped the mirror\nknobs into her open bag, and reached for her coat and gloves--she had\nnot removed her hat.\n\nPete gave the address.\n\n“It's just down the street a bit and up the hill,” he added excitedly,\ndivining her purpose. “It's a sort of a boarding-house, I reckon.”\n\n“A _boarding-house_--for Uncle William!” scorned Billy, her eyes ablaze.\n“Come, Bertram, we'll see about that.”\n\nBertram reached out a detaining hand.\n\n“But, dearest, you're so tired,” he demurred. “Hadn't we better wait\ntill after dinner, or till to-morrow?”\n\n“After dinner! To-morrow!” Billy's eyes blazed anew. “Why, Bertram\nHenshaw, do you think I'd leave that dear man even one minute longer,\nif I could help it, with a notion in his blessed old head that we didn't\n_want_ him?”\n\n“But you said a little while ago you had a headache, dear,” still\nobjected Bertram. “If you'd just eat your dinner!”\n\n“Dinner!” choked Billy. “I wonder if you think I could eat any dinner\nwith Uncle William turned out of his home! I'm going to find Uncle\nWilliam.” And she stumbled blindly toward the door.\n\nBertram reached for his hat. He threw a despairing glance into Pete's\neyes.\n\n“We'll be back--when we can,” he said, with a frown.\n\n“Yes, sir,” answered Pete, respectfully. Then, as if impelled by some\nhidden force, he touched his master's arm. “It was that way she looked,\nsir, when she came to _you_--that night last July--with her eyes all\nshining,” he whispered.\n\nA tender smile curved Bertram's lips. The frown vanished from his face.\n\n“Bless you, Pete--and bless her, too!” he whispered back. The next\nmoment he had hurried after his wife.\n\nThe house that bore the number Pete had given proved to have a\npretentious doorway, and a landlady who, in response to the summons of\nthe neat maid, appeared with a most impressive rustle of black silk and\njet bugles.\n\nNo, Mr. William Henshaw was not in his rooms. In fact, he was very\nseldom there. His business, she believed, called him to State Street\nthrough the day. Outside of that, she had been told, he spent much time\nsitting on a bench in the Common. Doubtless, if they cared to search,\nthey could find him there now.\n\n“A bench in the Common, indeed!” stormed Billy, as she and Bertram\nhurried down the wide stone steps. “Uncle William--on a bench!”\n\n“But surely now, dear,” ventured her husband, “you'll come home and get\nyour dinner!”\n\nBilly turned indignantly.\n\n“And leave Uncle William on a bench in the Common? Indeed, no! Why,\nBertram, you wouldn't, either,” she cried, as she turned resolutely\ntoward one of the entrances to the Common.\n\nAnd Bertram, with the “eyes all shining” still before him, could only\nmurmur: “No, of course not, dear!” and follow obediently where she led.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances it would have been a delightful hour for a\nwalk. The sun had almost set, and the shadows lay long across the grass.\nThe air was cool and unusually bracing for a day so early in September.\nBut all this was lost on Bertram. Bertram did not wish to take a walk.\nHe was hungry. He wanted his dinner; and he wanted, too, his old home\nwith his new wife flitting about the rooms as he had pictured this first\nevening together. He wanted William, of course. Certainly he wanted\nWilliam; but if William would insist on running away and sitting on\npark benches in this ridiculous fashion, he ought to take the\nconsequences--until to-morrow.\n\nFive, ten, fifteen minutes passed. Up one path and down another trudged\nthe anxious-eyed Billy and her increasingly impatient husband. Then when\nthe fifteen weary minutes had become a still more weary half-hour, the\nbonds Bertram had set on his temper snapped.\n\n“Billy,” he remonstrated despairingly, “do, please, come home! Don't you\nsee how highly improbable it is that we should happen on William if we\nwalked like this all night? He might move--change his seat--go home,\neven. He probably has gone home. And surely never before did a bride\ninsist on spending the first evening after her return tramping up and\ndown a public park for hour after hour like this, looking for any man.\n_Won't_ you come home?”\n\nBut Billy had not even heard. With a glad little cry she had darted to\nthe side of the humped-up figure of a man alone on a park bench just\nahead of them.\n\n“Uncle William! Oh, Uncle William, how could you?” she cried, dropping\nherself on to one end of the seat and catching the man's arm in both her\nhands.\n\n“Yes, how could you?” demanded Bertram, with just a touch of irritation,\ndropping himself on to the other end of the seat, and catching the man's\nother arm in his one usable hand.\n\nThe bent shoulders and bowed head straightened up with a jerk.\n\n“Well, well, bless my soul! If it isn't our little bride,” cried Uncle\nWilliam, fondly. “And the happy bridegroom, too. When did you get home?”\n\n“We haven't got home,” retorted Bertram, promptly, before his wife could\nspeak. “Oh, we looked in at the door an hour or so back; but we didn't\nstay. We've been hunting for you ever since.”\n\n“Nonsense, children!” Uncle William spoke with gay cheeriness; but he\nrefused to meet either Billy's or Bertram's eyes.\n\n“Uncle William, how could you do it?” reproached Billy, again.\n\n“Do what?” Uncle William was plainly fencing for time.\n\n“Leave the house like that?”\n\n“Ho! I wanted a change.”\n\n“As if we'd believe that!” scoffed Billy.\n\n“All right; let's call it you've had the change, then,” laughed Bertram,\n“and we'll send over for your things to-morrow. Come--now let's go home\nto dinner.”\n\nWilliam shook his head. He essayed a gay smile.\n\n“Why, I've only just begun. I'm going to stay--oh, I don't know how long\nI'm going to stay,” he finished blithely.\n\nBilly lifted her chin a little.\n\n“Uncle William, you aren't playing square. Pete told us what you said\nwhen you left.”\n\n“Eh? What?” William looked up with startled eyes.\n\n“About--about our not _needing_ you. So we know, now, why you left; and\nwe _sha'n't stand_ it.”\n\n“Pete? That? Oh, that--that's nonsense I--I'll settle with Pete.”\n\nBilly laughed softly.\n\n“Poor Pete! Don't. We simply dragged it out of him. And now we're here\nto tell you that we _do_ want you, and that you _must_ come back.”\n\nAgain William shook his head. A swift shadow crossed his face.\n\n“Thank you, no, children,” he said dully.\n\n“You're very kind, but you don't need me. I should be just an interfering\nelder brother. I should spoil your young married life.” (William's voice\nnow sounded as if he were reciting a well-learned lesson.) “If I went\naway and stayed two months, you'd never forget the utter freedom and joy\nof those two whole months with the house all to yourselves.”\n\n“Uncle William,” gasped Billy, “what _are_ you talking about?”\n\n“About--about my not going back, of course.”\n\n“But you are coming back,” cut in Bertram, almost angrily. “Oh, come,\nWill, this is utter nonsense, and you know it! Come, let's go home to\ndinner.”\n\nA stern look came to the corners of William's mouth--a look that Bertram\nunderstood well.\n\n“All right, I'll go to dinner, of course; but I sha'n't stay,” said\nWilliam, firmly. “I've thought it all out. I know I'm right. Come, we'll\ngo to dinner now, and say no more about it,” he finished with a cheery\nsmile, as he rose to his feet. Then, to the bride, he added: “Did you\nhave a nice trip, little girl?”\n\nBilly, too, had risen, now, but she did not seem to have heard his\nquestion. In the fast falling twilight her face looked a little white.\n\n“Uncle William,” she began very quietly, “do you think for a minute that\njust because I married your brother I am going to live in that house and\nturn you out of the home you've lived in all your life?”\n\n“Nonsense, dear! I'm not turned out. I just go,” corrected Uncle\nWilliam, gayly.\n\nWith superb disdain Billy brushed this aside.\n\n“Oh, no, you won't,” she declared; “but--_I shall_.”\n\n“Billy!” gasped Bertram.\n\n“My--my dear!” expostulated William, faintly.\n\n“Uncle William! Bertram! Listen,” panted Billy. “I never told you much\nbefore, but I'm going to, now. Long ago, when I went away with Aunt\nHannah, your sister Kate showed me how dear the old home was to\nyou--how much you thought of it. And she said--she said that I had\nupset everything.” (Bertram interjected a sharp word, but Billy paid\nno attention.) “That's why I went; and _I shall go again_--if you\ndon't come home to-morrow to stay, Uncle William. Come, now let's go to\ndinner, please. Bertram's hungry,” she finished, with a bright smile.\n\nThere was a tense moment of silence. William glanced at Bertram; Bertram\nreturned the glance--with interest.\n\n“Er--ah--yes; well, we might go to dinner,” stammered William, after a\nminute.\n\n“Er--yes,” agreed Bertram. And the three fell into step together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. “JUST LIKE BILLY”\n\n\nBilly did not leave the Strata this time. Before twenty-four hours had\npassed, the last cherished fragment of Mr. William Henshaw's possessions\nhad been carefully carried down the imposing steps of the Beacon\nHill boarding-house under the disapproving eyes of its bugle-adorned\nmistress, who found herself now with a month's advance rent and two\nvacant “parlors” on her hands. Before another twenty-four hours had\npassed her quondam boarder, with a tired sigh, sank into his favorite\nmorris chair in his old familiar rooms, and looked about him with\ncontented eyes. Every treasure was in place, from the traditional four\nsmall stones of his babyhood days to the Batterseas Billy had just\nbrought him. Pete, as of yore, was hovering near with a dust-cloth.\nBertram's gay whistle sounded from the floor below. William Henshaw was\nat home again.\n\nThis much accomplished, Billy went to see Aunt Hannah.\n\nAunt Hannah greeted her affectionately, though with tearfully troubled\neyes. She was wearing a gray shawl to-day topped with a black one--sure\nsign of unrest, either physical or mental, as all her friends knew.\n\n“I'd begun to think you'd forgotten--me,” she faltered, with a poor\nattempt at gayety.\n\n“You've been home three whole days.”\n\n“I know, dearie,” smiled Billy; “and 'twas a shame. But I have been so\nbusy! My trunks came at last, and I've been helping Uncle William get\nsettled, too.”\n\nAunt Hannah looked puzzled.\n\n“Uncle William get settled? You mean--he's changed his room?”\n\nBilly laughed oddly, and threw a swift glance into Aunt Hannah's face.\n\n“Well, yes, he did change,” she murmured; “but he's moved back now into\nthe old quarters. Er--you haven't heard from Uncle William then, lately,\nI take it.”\n\n“No.” Aunt Hannah shook her head abstractedly. “I did see him once,\nseveral weeks ago; but I haven't, since. We had quite a talk, then;\nand, Billy, I've been wanting to speak to you,” she hurried on, a little\nfeverishly. “I didn't like to leave, of course, till you did come home,\nas long as you'd said nothing about your plans; but--”\n\n“Leave!” interposed Billy, dazedly. “Leave where? What do you mean?”\n\n“Why, leave here, of course, dear. I mean. I didn't like to get my room\nwhile you were away; but I shall now, of course, at once.”\n\n“Nonsense, Aunt Hannah! As if I'd let you do that,” laughed Billy.\n\nAunt Hannah stiffened perceptibly. Her lips looked suddenly thin and\ndetermined. Even the soft little curls above her ears seemed actually to\nbristle with resolution.\n\n“Billy,” she began firmly, “we might as well understand each other at\nonce. I know your good heart, and I appreciate your kindness. But I can\nnot come to live with you. I shall not. It wouldn't be best. I should\nbe like an interfering elder brother in your home. I should spoil your\nyoung married life; and if I went away for two months you'd never forget\nthe utter joy and freedom of those two months with the whole house ali\nto yourselves.”\n\nAt the beginning of this speech Billy's eyes had still carried their\ndancing smile, but as the peroration progressed on to the end, a dawning\nsurprise, which soon became a puzzled questioning, drove the smile away.\nThen Billy sat suddenly erect.\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, that's exactly what Uncle William--” Billy stopped,\nand regarded Aunt Hannah with quick suspicion. The next moment she burst\ninto gleeful laughter.\n\nAunt Hannah looked grieved, and not a little surprised; but Billy did\nnot seem to notice this.\n\n“Oh, oh, Aunt Hannah--you, too! How perfectly funny!” she gurgled. “To\nthink you two old blesseds should get your heads together like this!”\n\nAunt Hannah stirred restively, and pulled the black shawl more closely\nabout her.\n\n“Indeed, Billy, I don't know what you mean by that,” she sighed, with a\nvisible effort at self-control; “but I do know that I can not go to live\nwith you.”\n\n“Bless your heart, dear, I don't want you to,” soothed Billy, with gay\npromptness.\n\n“Oh! O-h-h,” stammered Aunt Hannah, surprise, mortification, dismay, and\na grieved hurt bringing a flood of color to her face. It is one thing to\nrefuse a home, and quite another to have a home refused you.\n\n“Oh! O-h-h, Aunt Hannah,” cried Billy, turning very red in her turn.\n“Please, _please_ don't look like that. I didn't mean it that way. I do\nwant you, dear, only--I want you somewhere else more. I want you--here.”\n\n“Here!” Aunt Hannah looked relieved, but unconvinced.\n\n“Yes. Don't you like it here?”\n\n“Like it! Why, I love it, dear. You know I do. But you don't need this\nhouse now, Billy.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I do,” retorted Billy, airily. “I'm going to keep it up, and I\nwant you here.\n\n“Fiddlededee, Billy! As if I'd let you keep up this house just for me,”\n scorned Aunt Hannah.\n\n“'Tisn't just for you. It's for--for lots of folks.”\n\n“My grief and conscience, Billy! What are you talking about?”\n\nBilly laughed, and settled herself more comfortably on the hassock at\nAunt Hannah's feet.\n\n“Well, I'll tell you. Just now I want it for Tommy Dunn, and the\nGreggorys if I can get them, and maybe one or two others. There'll\nalways be somebody. You see, I had thought I'd have them at the Strata.”\n\n“Tommy Dunn--at the Strata!”\n\nBilly laughed again ruefully.\n\n“O dear! You sound just like Bertram,” she pouted. “He didn't want\nTommy, either, nor any of the rest of them.”\n\n“The rest of them!”\n\n“Well, I could have had a lot more, you know, the Strata is so big,\nespecially now that Cyril has gone, and left all those empty rooms.\n_I_ got real enthusiastic, but Bertram didn't. He just laughed and said\n'nonsense!' until he found I was really in earnest; then he--well, he\nsaid 'nonsense,' then, too--only he didn't laugh,” finished Billy, with\na sigh.\n\nAunt Hannah regarded her with fond, though slightly exasperated eyes.\n\n“Billy, you are, indeed, a most extraordinary young woman--at times.\nSurely, with you, a body never knows what to expect--except the\nunexpected.”\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah!--and from you, too!” reproached Billy, mischievously;\nbut Aunt Hannah had yet more to say.\n\n“Of course Bertram thought it was nonsense. The idea of you, a bride,\nfilling up your house with--with people like that! Tommy Dunn, indeed!”\n\n“Oh, Bertram said he liked Tommy all right,” sighed Billy; “but he said\nthat that didn't mean he wanted him for three meals a day. One would\nthink poor Tommy was a breakfast food! So that is when I thought of\nkeeping up this house, you see, and that's why I want you here--to take\ncharge of it. And you'll do that--for me, won't you?”\n\nAunt Hannah fell back in her chair.\n\n“Why, y-yes, Billy, of course, if--if you want it. But what an\nextraordinary idea, child!”\n\nBilly shook her head. A deeper color came to her cheeks, and a softer\nglow to her eyes.\n\n“I don't think so, Aunt Hannah. It's only that I'm so happy that some\nof it has just got to overflow somewhere, and this is going to be the\noverflow house--a sort of safety valve for me, you see. I'm going to\ncall it the Annex--it will be an annex to our home. And I want to keep\nit full, always, of people who--who can make the best use of all that\nextra happiness that I can't possibly use myself,” she finished a little\ntremulously. “Don't you see?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I _see_,” replied Aunt Hannah, with a fond shake of the head.\n\n“But, really, listen--it's sensible,” urged Billy. “First, there's\nTommy. His mother died last month. He's at a neighbor's now, but they're\ngoing to send him to a Home for Crippled Children; and he's grieving his\nheart out over it. I'm going to bring him here to a real home--the kind\nthat doesn't begin with a capital letter. He adores music, and he's got\nreal talent, I think. Then there's the Greggorys.”\n\nAunt Hannah looked dubious.\n\n“You can't get the Greggorys to--to use any of that happiness, Billy.\nThey're too proud.”\n\nBilly smiled radiantly.\n\n“I know I can't get them to _use_ it, Aunt Hannah, but I believe I can\nget them to _give_ it,” she declared triumphantly. “I shall ask Alice\nGreggory to teach Tommy music, and I shall ask Mrs. Greggory to teach\nhim books; and I shall tell them both that I positively need them to\nkeep you company.”\n\n“Oh, but Billy,” bridled Aunt Hannah, with prompt objection.\n\n“Tut, tut!--I know you'll be willing to be thrown as a little bit of a\nsop to the Greggorys' pride,” coaxed Billy. “You just wait till I get\nthe Overflow Annex in running order. Why, Aunt Hannah, you don't know\nhow busy you're going to be handing out all that extra happiness that I\ncan't use!”\n\n“You dear child!” Aunt Hannah smiled mistily. The black shawl had fallen\nunheeded to the floor now. “As if anybody ever had any more happiness\nthan one's self could use!”\n\n“I have,” avowed Billy, promptly, “and it's going to keep growing and\ngrowing, I know.”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, don't!” exclaimed Aunt Hannah,\nlifting shocked hands of remonstrance. “Rap on wood--do! How can you\nboast like that?”\n\nBilly dimpled roguishly and sprang to her feet.\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, I'm ashamed of you! To be superstitious like\nthat--you, a good Presbyterian!”\n\nAunt Hannah subsided shamefacedly.\n\n“Yes, I know, Billy, it is silly; but I just can't help it.”\n\n“Oh, but it's worse than silly, Aunt Hannah,” teased Billy, with a\nremorseless chuckle. “It's really _heathen!_ Bertram told me once that\nit dates 'way back to the time of the Druids--appealing to the god of\ntrees, or something like that--when you rap on wood, you know.”\n\n“Ugh!” shuddered Aunt Hannah. “As if I would, Billy! How is Bertram, by\nthe by?”\n\nA swift shadow crossed Billy's bright face.\n\n“He's lovely--only his arm.”\n\n“His arm! But I thought that was better.”\n\n“Oh, it is,” drooped Billy, “but it gets along so slowly, and it frets\nhim dreadfully. You know he never can do anything with his left hand,\nhe says, and he just hates to have things done for him--though Pete and\nDong Ling are quarreling with each other all the time to do things for\nhim, and I'm quarreling with both of them to do them for him myself! By\nthe way, Dong Ling is going to leave us next week. Did you know it?”\n\n“Dong Ling--leave!”\n\n“Yes. Oh, he told Bertram long ago he should go when we were married;\nthat he had plenty much money, and was going back to China, and not be\nMelican man any longer. But I don't think Bertram thought he'd do it.\nWilliam says Dong Ling went to Pete, however, after we left, and told\nhim he wanted to go; that he liked the little Missee plenty well, but\nthat there'd be too much hen-talk when she got back, and--”\n\n“Why, the impudent creature!”\n\nBilly laughed merrily.\n\n“Yes; Pete was furious, William says, but Dong Ling didn't mean any\ndisrespect, I'm sure. He just wasn't used to having petticoats around,\nand didn't want to take orders from them; that's all.”\n\n“But, Billy, what will you do?”\n\n“Oh, Pete's fixed all that lovely,” returned Billy, nonchalantly. “You\nknow his niece lives over in South Boston, and it seems she's got a\ndaughter who's a fine cook and will be glad to come. Mercy! Look at the\ntime,” she broke off, glancing at the clock. “I shall be late to dinner,\nand Dong Ling loathes anybody who's late to his meals--as I found out to\nmy sorrow the night we got home. Good-by, dear. I'll be out soon again\nand fix it all up--about the Annex, you know.” And with a bright smile\nshe was gone.\n\n“Dear me,” sighed Aunt Hannah, stooping to pick up the black shawl;\n“dear me! Of course everything will be all right--there's a girl coming,\neven if Dong Ling is going. But--but--Oh, my grief and conscience, what\nan extraordinary child Billy is, to be sure--but what a dear one!” she\nadded, wiping a quick tear from her eye. “An Overflow Annex, indeed, for\nher 'extra happiness'! Now isn't that just like Billy?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. TIGER SKINS\n\n\nSeptember passed and October came, bringing with it cool days and clear,\ncrisp evenings royally ruled over by a gorgeous harvest moon. According\nto Billy everything was just perfect--except, of course, poor Bertram's\narm; and even the fact that that gained so slowly was not without its\nadvantage (again according to Billy), for it gave Bertram more time to\nbe with her.\n\n“You see, dear, as long as you _can't_ paint,” she told him earnestly,\none day, “why, I'm not really hindering you by keeping you with me so\nmuch.”\n\n“You certainly are not,” he retorted, with a smile.\n\n“Then I may be just as happy as I like over it,” settled Billy,\ncomfortably.\n\n“As if you ever could hinder me,” he ridiculed.\n\n“Oh, yes, I could,” nodded Billy, emphatically. “You forget, sir. That\nwas what worried me so. Everybody, even the newspapers and magazines,\nsaid I _would_ do it, too. They said I'd slay your Art, stifle your\nAmbition, destroy your Inspiration, and be a nuisance generally. And\nKate said--”\n\n“Yes. Well, never mind what Kate said,” interrupted the man, savagely.\n\nBilly laughed, and gave his ear a playful tweak.\n\n“All right; but I'm not going to do it, you know--spoil your career,\nsir. You just wait,” she continued dramatically. “The minute your arm\ngets so you can paint, I myself shall conduct you to your studio, thrust\nthe brushes into your hand, fill your palette with all the colors of\nthe rainbow, and order you to paint, my lord, paint! But--until then I'm\ngoing to have you all I like,” she finished, with a complete change of\nmanner, nestling into the ready curve of his good left arm.\n\n“You witch!” laughed the man, fondly. “Why, Billy, you couldn't hinder\nme. You'll _be_ my inspiration, dear, instead of slaying it. You'll see.\n_This_ time Marguerite Winthrop's portrait is going to be a success.”\n\nBilly turned quickly.\n\n“Then you are--that is, you haven't--I mean, you're going to--paint it?”\n\n“I just am,” avowed the artist. “And this time it'll be a success, too,\nwith you to help.”\n\nBilly drew in her breath tremulously.\n\n“I didn't know but you'd already started it,” she faltered.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“No. After the other one failed, and Mr. Winthrop asked me to try again,\nI couldn't _then_. I was so troubled over you. That's the time you did\nhinder me,” he smiled. “Then came your note breaking the engagement. Of\ncourse I knew too much to attempt a thing like that portrait then. But\nnow--_now_--!” The pause and the emphasis were eloquent.\n\n“Of course, _now_,” nodded Billy, brightly, but a little feverishly.\n“And when do you begin?”\n\n“Not till January. Miss Winthrop won't be back till then. I saw J. G.\nlast week, and I told him I'd accept his offer to try again.”\n\n“What did he say?”\n\n“He gave my left hand a big grip and said: 'Good!--and you'll win out\nthis time.'”\n\n“Of course you will,” nodded Billy, again, though still a little\nfeverishly. “And this time I sha'n't mind a bit if you do stay to\nluncheon, and break engagements with me, sir,” she went on, tilting\nher chin archly, “for I shall know it's the portrait and not the sitter\nthat's really keeping you. Oh, you'll see what a fine artist's wife I'll\nmake!”\n\n“The very best,” declared Bertram so ardently that Billy blushed, and\nshook her head in reproof.\n\n“Nonsense! I wasn't fishing. I didn't mean it that way,” she protested.\nThen, as he tried to catch her, she laughed and danced teasingly out of\nhis reach.\n\nBecause Bertram could not paint, therefore, Billy had him quite to\nherself these October days; nor did she hesitate to appropriate him.\nNeither, on his part, was Bertram loath to be appropriated. Like two\nlovers they read and walked and talked together, and like two children,\nsometimes, they romped through the stately old rooms with Spunkie, or\nwith Tommy Dunn, who was a frequent guest. Spunkie, be it known, was\nrenewing her kittenhood, so potent was the influence of the dangling\nstrings and rolling balls that she encountered everywhere; and Tommy\nDunn, with Billy's help, was learning that not even a pair of crutches\nneed keep a lonely little lad from a frolic. Even William, roused from\nhis after-dinner doze by peals of laughter, was sometimes inveigled into\nactivities that left him breathless, but curiously aglow. While Pete,\npolishing silver in the dining-room down-stairs, smiled indulgently at\nthe merry clatter above--and forgot the teasing pain in his side.\n\nBut it was not all nonsense with Billy, nor gay laughter. More often\nit was a tender glow in the eyes, a softness in the voice, a radiant\nsomething like an aura of joy all about her, that told how happy indeed\nwere these days for her. There was proof by word of mouth, too--long\ntalks with Bertram in the dancing firelight when they laid dear\nplans for the future, and when she tried so hard to make her husband\nunderstand what a good, good wife she intended to be, and how she meant\nnever to let anything come between them.\n\nIt was so earnest and serious a Billy by this time that Bertram would\nturn startled, dismayed eyes on his young wife; whereupon, with a very\nBilly-like change of mood, she would give him one of her rare caresses,\nand perhaps sigh:\n\n“Goosey--it's only because I'm so happy, happy, happy! Why, Bertram, if\nit weren't for that Overflow Annex I believe I--I just couldn't live!”\n\nIt was Bertram who sighed then, and who prayed fervently in his heart\nthat never might he see a real shadow cloud that dear face.\n\nThus far, certainly, the cares of matrimony had rested anything but\nheavily upon the shapely young shoulders of the new wife. Domestic\naffairs at the Strata moved like a piece of well-oiled machinery.\nDong Ling, to be sure, was not there; but in his place reigned Pete's\ngrandniece, a fresh-faced, capable young woman who (Bertram declared)\ncooked like an angel and minded her own business like a man. Pete, as\nof yore, had full charge of the house; and a casual eye would see few\nchanges. Even the brothers themselves saw few, for that matter.\n\nTrue, at the very first, Billy had donned a ruffled apron and a\nbewitching dust-cap, and had traversed the house from cellar to garret\nwith a prettily important air of “managing things,” as she suggested\nchanges right and left. She had summoned Pete, too, for three mornings\nin succession, and with great dignity had ordered the meals for the day.\nBut when Bertram was discovered one evening tugging back his favorite\nchair, and when William had asked if Billy were through using his\npipe-tray, the young wife had concluded to let things remain about as\nthey were. And when William ate no breakfast one morning, and Bertram\naggrievedly refused dessert that night at dinner, Billy--learning\nthrough an apologetic Pete that Master William always had to have eggs\nfor breakfast no matter what else there was, and that Master Bertram\nnever ate boiled rice--gave up planning the meals. True, for three more\nmornings she summoned Pete for “orders,” but the orders were nothing\nmore nor less than a blithe “Well, Pete, what are we going to have for\ndinner to-day?” By the end of a week even this ceremony was given up,\nand before a month had passed, Billy was little more than a guest in her\nown home, so far as responsibility was concerned.\n\nBilly was not idle, however; far from it. First, there were the\ndelightful hours with Bertram. Then there was her music: Billy was\nwriting a new song--the best she had ever written, Billy declared.\n\n“Why, Bertram, it can't help being that,” she said to her husband, one\nday. “The words just sang themselves to me right out of my heart; and\nthe melody just dropped down from the sky. And now, everywhere, I'm\nhearing the most wonderful harmonies. The whole universe is singing to\nme. If only now I can put it on paper what I hear! Then I can make the\nwhole universe sing to some one else!”\n\nEven music, however, had to step one side for the wedding calls which\nwere beginning to be received, and which must be returned, in spite\nof the occasional rebellion of the young husband. There were the more\nintimate friends to be seen, also, and Cyril and Marie to be visited.\nAnd always there was the Annex.\n\nThe Annex was in fine running order now, and was a source of infinite\nsatisfaction to its founder and great happiness to its beneficiaries.\nTommy Dunn was there, learning wonderful things from books and still\nmore wonderful things from the piano in the living-room. Alice Greggory\nand her mother were there, too--the result of much persuasion. Indeed,\naccording to Bertram, Billy had been able to fill the Annex only\nby telling each prospective resident that he or she was absolutely\nnecessary to the welfare and happiness of every other resident. Not that\nthe house was full, either. There were still two unoccupied rooms.\n\n“But then, I'm glad there are,” Billy had declared, “for there's sure to\nbe some one that I'll want to send there.”\n\n“Some _one_, did you say?” Bertram had retorted, meaningly; but his wife\nhad disdained to answer this.\n\nBilly herself was frequently at the Annex. She told Aunt Hannah that\nshe had to come often to bring the happiness--it accumulated so fast.\nCertainly she always found plenty to do there, whenever she came. There\nwas Aunt Hannah to be read to, Mrs. Greggory to be sung to, and Tommy\nDunn to be listened to; for Tommy Dunn was always quivering with\neagerness to play her his latest “piece.”\n\nBilly knew that some day at the Annex she would meet Mr. M. J.\nArkwright; and she told herself that she hoped she should.\n\nBilly had not seen Arkwright (except on the stage of the Boston Opera\nHouse) since the day he had left her presence in white-faced, stony-eyed\nmisery after declaring his love for her, and learning of her engagement\nto Bertram. Since then, she knew, he had been much with his old friend,\nAlice Greggory. She did not believe, should she see him now, that he\nwould be either white-faced, or stony-eyed. His heart, she was sure,\nhad gone where it ought to have gone in the first place--to Alice. Such\nbeing, in her opinion, the case, she longed to get the embarrassment of\na first meeting between themselves over with, for, after that, she\nwas sure, their old friendship could be renewed, and she would be in a\nposition to further this pretty love affair between him and Alice. Very\ndecidedly, therefore, Billy wished to meet Arkwright. Very pleased,\nconsequently, was she when, one day, coming into the living-room at the\nAnnex, she found the man sitting by the fire.\n\nArkwright was on his feet at once.\n\n“Miss--Mrs. H--Henshaw,” he stammered\n\n“Oh, Mr. Arkwright,” she cried, with just a shade of nervousness in her\nvoice as she advanced, her hand outstretched. “I'm glad to see you.”\n\n“Thank you. I wanted to see Miss Greggory,” he murmured. Then, as\nthe unconscious rudeness of his reply dawned on him, he made matters\ninfinitely worse by an attempted apology. “That is, I mean--I didn't\nmean--” he began to stammer miserably.\n\nSome girls might have tossed the floundering man a straw in the shape of\na light laugh intended to turn aside all embarrassment--but not Billy.\nBilly held out a frankly helping hand that was meant to set the man\nsquarely on his feet at her side.\n\n“Mr. Arkwright, don't, please,” she begged earnestly. “You and I don't\nneed to beat about the bush. I _am_ glad to see you, and I hope you're\nglad to see me. We're going to be the best of friends from now on, I'm\nsure; and some day, soon, you're going to bring Alice to see me, and\nwe'll have some music. I left her up-stairs. She'll be down at once,\nI dare say--I met Rosa going up with your card. Good-by,” she finished\nwith a bright smile, as she turned and walked rapidly from the room.\n\nOutside, on the steps, Billy drew a long breath.\n\n“There,” she whispered; “that's over--and well over!” The next minute\nshe frowned vexedly. She had missed her glove. “Never mind! I sha'n't go\nback in there for it now, anyway,” she decided.\n\nIn the living-room, five minutes later, Alice Greggory found only a\nhastily scrawled note waiting for her.\n\n\n“If you'll forgive the unforgivable,” she read “you'll forgive me for\nnot being here when you come down. 'Circumstances over which I have no\ncontrol have called me away.' May we let it go at that?\n\n“M. J. ARKWRIGHT.”\n\n\nAs Alice Greggory's amazed, questioning eyes left the note they fell\nupon the long white glove on the floor by the door. Half mechanically\nshe crossed the room and picked it up; but almost at once she dropped it\nwith a low cry.\n\n“Billy! He--saw--Billy!” Then a flood of understanding dyed her face\nscarlet as she turned and fled to the blessedly unseeing walls of her\nown room.\n\nNot ten minutes later Rosa tapped at her door with a note.\n\n“It's from Mr. Arkwright, Miss. He's downstairs.” Rosa's eyes were\npuzzled, and a bit startled.\n\n“Mr. Arkwright!”\n\n“Yes, Miss. He's come again. That is, I didn't know he'd went--but he\nmust have, for he's come again now. He wrote something in a little book;\nthen he tore it out and gave it to me. He said he'd wait, please, for an\nanswer.”\n\n“Oh, very well, Rosa.”\n\nMiss Greggory took the note and spoke with an elaborate air of\nindifference that was meant to express a calm ignoring of the puzzled\nquestioning in the other's eyes. The next moment she read this in\nArkwright's peculiar scrawl:\n\n\n“If you've already forgiven the unforgivable, you'll do it again, I\nknow, and come down-stairs. Won't you, please? I want to see you.”\n\n\nMiss Greggory lifted her head with a jerk. Her face was a painful red.\n\n“Tell Mr. Arkwright I can't possibly--” She came to an abrupt pause. Her\neyes had encountered Rosa's, and in Rosa's eyes the puzzled questioning\nwas plainly fast becoming a shrewd suspicion.\n\nThere was the briefest of hesitations; then, lightly, Miss Greggory\ntossed the note aside.\n\n“Tell Mr. Arkwright I'll be down at once, please,” she directed\ncarelessly, as she turned back into the room.\n\nBut she was not down at once. She was not down until she had taken time\nto bathe her red eyes, powder her telltale nose, smoothe her ruffled\nhair, and whip herself into the calm, steady-eyed, self-controlled young\nwoman that Arkwright finally rose to meet when she came into the room.\n\n“I thought it was only women who were privileged to change their mind,”\n she began brightly; but Arkwright ignored her attempt to conventionalize\nthe situation.\n\n“Thank you for coming down,” he said, with a weariness that instantly\ndrove the forced smile from the girl's lips. “I--I wanted to--to talk to\nyou.”\n\n“Yes?” She seated herself and motioned him to a chair near her. He took\nthe seat, and then fell silent, his eyes out the window.\n\n“I thought you said you--you wanted to talk, she reminded him nervously,\nafter a minute.\n\n“I did.” He turned with disconcerting abruptness. “Alice, I'm going to\ntell you a story.”\n\n“I shall be glad to listen. People always like stories, don't they?”\n\n“Do they?” The somber pain in Arkwright's eyes deepened. Alice Greggory\ndid not know it, but he was thinking of another story he had once told\nin that same room. Billy was his listener then, while now--A little\nprecipitately he began to speak.\n\n“When I was a very small boy I went to visit my uncle, who, in his young\ndays, had been quite a hunter. Before the fireplace in his library was a\nhuge tiger skin with a particularly lifelike head. The first time I saw\nit I screamed, and ran and hid. I refused then even to go into the room\nagain. My cousins urged, scolded, pleaded, and laughed at me by turns,\nbut I was obdurate. I would not go where I could see the fearsome thing\nagain, even though it was, as they said, 'nothing but a dead old rug!'\n\n“Finally, one day, my uncle took a hand in the matter. By sheer\nwill-power he forced me to go with him straight up to the dreaded\ncreature, and stand by its side. He laid one of my shrinking hands on\nthe beast's smooth head, and thrust the other one quite into the open\nred mouth with its gleaming teeth.\n\n“'You see,' he said, 'there's absolutely nothing to fear. He can't\npossibly hurt you. Just as if you weren't bigger and finer and stronger\nin every way than that dead thing on the floor!'\n\n“Then, when he had got me to the point where of my own free will I would\nwalk up and touch the thing, he drew a lesson for me.\n\n“'Now remember,' he charged me. 'Never run and hide again. Only cowards\ndo that. Walk straight up and face the thing. Ten to one you'll find\nit's nothing but a dead skin masquerading as the real thing. Even if it\nisn't if it's alive--face it. Find a weapon and fight it. Know that you\nare going to conquer it and you'll conquer. Never run. Be a man. Men\ndon't run, my boy!'”\n\nArkwright paused, and drew a long breath. He did not look at the girl\nin the opposite chair. If he had looked he would have seen a face\ntransfigured.\n\n“Well,” he resumed, “I never forgot that tiger skin, nor what it stood\nfor, after that day when Uncle Ben thrust my hand into its hideous, but\nharmless, red mouth. Even as a kid I began, then, to try--not to run.\nI've tried ever since But to-day--I did run.”\n\nArkwright's voice had been getting lower and lower. The last three words\nwould have been almost inaudible to ears less sensitively alert than\nwere Alice Greggory's. For a moment after the words were uttered, only\nthe clock's ticking broke the silence; then, with an obvious effort, the\nman roused himself, as if breaking away from some benumbing force that\nheld him.\n\n“Alice, I don't need to tell you, after what I said the other night,\nthat I loved Billy Neilson. That was bad enough, for I found she was\npledged to another man. But to-day I discovered something worse: I\ndiscovered that I loved Billy _Henshaw_--another man's wife. And--I ran.\nBut I've come back. I'm going to face the thing. Oh, I'm not deceiving\nmyself! This love of mine is no dead tiger skin. It's a beast, alive and\nalert--God pity me!--to destroy my very soul. But I'm going to fight it;\nand--I want you to help me.”\n\nThe girl gave a half-smothered cry. The man turned, but he could not\nsee her face distinctly. Twilight had come, and the room was full of\nshadows. He hesitated, then went on, a little more quietly.\n\n“That's why I've told you all this--so you would help me. And you will,\nwon't you?”\n\nThere was no answer. Once again he tried to see her face, but it was\nturned now quite away from him.\n\n“You've been a big help already, little girl. Your friendship, your\ncomradeship--they've been everything to me. You're not going to make me\ndo without them--now?”\n\n“No--oh, no!” The answer was low and a little breathless; but he heard\nit.\n\n“Thank you. I knew you wouldn't.” He paused, then rose to his feet. When\nhe spoke again his voice carried a note of whimsical lightness that was\na little forced. “But I must go--else you _will_ take them from me,\nand with good reason. And please don't let your kind heart grieve too\nmuch--over me. I'm no deep-dyed villain in a melodrama, nor wicked lover\nin a ten-penny novel, you know. I'm just an everyday man in real life;\nand we're going to fight this thing out in everyday living. That's where\nyour help is coming in. We'll go together to see Mrs. Bertram Henshaw.\nShe's asked us to, and you'll do it, I know. We'll have music and\neveryday talk. We'll see Mrs. Bertram Henshaw in her own home with her\nhusband, where she belongs; and--I'm not going to run again. But--I'm\ncounting on your help, you know,” he smiled a little wistfully, as he\nheld out his hand in good-by.\n\nOne minute later Alice Greggory, alone, was hurrying up-stairs.\n\n“I can't--I can't--I know I can't,” she was whispering wildly. Then,\nin her own room, she faced herself in the mirror. “Yes--you--can, Alice\nGreggory,” she asserted, with swift change of voice and manner. “This\nis _your_ tiger skin, and you're going to fight it. Do you\nunderstand?--fight it! And you're going to win, too. Do you want that\nman to know you--_care_?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. “THE PAINTING LOOK”\n\n\nIt was toward the last of October that Billy began to notice her\nhusband's growing restlessness. Twice, when she had been playing to\nhim, she turned to find him testing the suppleness of his injured arm.\nSeveral times, failing to receive an answer to her questions, she had\nlooked up to discover him gazing abstractedly at nothing in particular.\n\nThey read and walked and talked together, to be sure, and Bertram's\ndevotion to her lightest wish was beyond question; but more and more\nfrequently these days Billy found him hovering over his sketches in his\nstudio; and once, when he failed to respond to the dinner-bell,\nsearch revealed him buried in a profound treatise on “The Art of\nForeshortening.”\n\nThen came the day when Billy, after an hour's vain effort to imprison\nwithin notes a tantalizing melody, captured the truant and rain down to\nthe studio to tell Bertram of her victory.\n\nBut Bertram did not seem even to hear her. True, he leaped to his feet\nand hurried to meet her, his face radiantly aglow; but she had not\nceased to speak before he himself was talking.\n\n“Billy, Billy, I've been sketching,” he cried. “My hand is almost\nsteady. See, some of those lines are all right! I just picked up a\ncrayon and--” He stopped abruptly, his eyes on Billy's face. A vaguely\ntroubled shadow crossed his own. “Did--did you--were you saying anything\nin--in particular, when you came in?” he stammered.\n\nFor a short half-minute Billy looked at her husband without speaking.\nThen, a little queerly, she laughed.\n\n“Oh, no, nothing at all in _particular_,” she retorted airily. The next\nmoment, with one of her unexpected changes of manner, she darted across\nthe room, picked up a palette, and a handful of brushes from the\nlong box near it. Advancing toward her husband she held them out\ndramatically. “And now paint, my lord, paint!” she commanded him, with\nstern insistence, as she thrust them into his hands.\n\nBertram laughed shamefacedly.\n\n“Oh, I say, Billy,” he began; but Billy had gone.\n\nOut in the hall Billy was speeding up-stairs, talking fiercely to\nherself.\n\n“We'll, Billy Neilson Henshaw, it's come! Now behave yourself. _That was\nthe painting look!_ You know what that means. Remember, he belongs to\nhis Art before he does to you. Kate and everybody says so. And you--you\nexpected him to tend to you and your silly little songs. Do you want to\nruin his career? As if now he could spend all his time and give all his\nthoughts to you! But I--I just hate that Art!”\n\n“What did you say, Billy?” asked William, in mild surprise, coming\naround the turn of the balustrade in the hall above. “Were you speaking\nto me, my dear?”\n\nBilly looked up. Her face cleared suddenly, and she laughed--though a\nlittle ruefully.\n\n“No, Uncle William, I wasn't talking to you,” she sighed. “I was\njust--just administering first aid to the injured,” she finished, as she\nwhisked into her own room.\n\n“Well, well, bless the child! What can she mean by that?” puzzled Uncle\nWilliam, turning to go down the stairway.\n\nBertram began to paint a very little the next day. He painted still more\nthe next, and yet more again the day following. He was like a bird let\nout of a cage, so joyously alive was he. The old sparkle came back to\nhis eye, the old gay smile to his lips. Now that they had come back\nBilly realized what she had not been conscious of before: that for\nseveral weeks past they had not been there; and she wondered which hurt\nthe more--that they had not been there before, or that they were there\nnow. Then she scolded herself roundly for asking the question at all.\n\nThey were not easy--those days for Billy, though always to Bertram she\nmanaged to show a cheerfully serene face. To Uncle William, also, and to\nAunt Hannah she showed a smiling countenance; and because she could\nnot talk to anybody else of her feelings, she talked to herself. This,\nhowever, was no new thing for Billy to do From earliest childhood she\nhad fought things out in like manner.\n\n“But it's so absurd of you, Billy Henshaw,” she berated herself one day,\nwhen Bertram had become so absorbed in his work that he had forgotten to\nkeep his appointment with her for a walk. “Just because you have had his\nconstant attention almost every hour since you were married is no reason\nwhy you should have it every hour now, when his arm is better! Besides,\nit's exactly what you said you wouldn't do--object--to his giving proper\ntime to his work.”\n\n“But I'm not objecting,” stormed the other half of herself. “I'm\n_telling_ him to do it. It's only that he's so--so _pleased_ to do it.\nHe doesn't seem to mind a bit being away from me. He's actually happy!”\n\n“Well, don't you want him to be happy in his work? Fie! For shame! A\nfine artist's wife you are. It seems Kate was right, then; you _are_\ngoing to spoil his career!”\n\n“Ho!” quoth Billy, and tossed her head. Forthwith she crossed the room\nto her piano and plumped herself down hard on to the stool. Then, from\nunder her fingers there fell a rollicking melody that seemed to fill the\nroom with little dancing feet. Faster and faster sped Billy's fingers;\nswifter and swifter twinkled the little dancing feet. Then a door was\njerked open, and Bertram's voice called:\n\n“Billy!”\n\nThe music stopped instantly. Billy sprang from her seat, her\neyes eagerly seeking the direction from which had come the voice.\nPerhaps--_perhaps_ Bertram wanted her. Perhaps he was not going to paint\nany longer that morning, after all. “Billy!” called the voice again.\n“Please, do you mind stopping that playing just for a little while? I'm\na brute, I know, dear, but my brush _will_ try to keep time with that\ncrazy little tune of yours, and you know my hand is none too steady,\nanyhow, and when it tries to keep up with that jiggety, jig, jig,\njiggety, jig, jig--! _Do_ you mind, darling, just--just sewing, or\ndoing something still for a while?”\n\nAll the light fled from Billy's face, but her voice, when she spoke, was\nthe quintessence of cheery indifference.\n\n“Why, no, of course not, dear.”\n\n“Thank you. I knew you wouldn't,” sighed Bertram. Then the door shut.\n\nFor a long minute Billy stood motionless before she glanced at her watch\nand sped to the telephone.\n\n“Is Miss Greggory there, Rosa?” she called when the operator's ring was\nanswered.\n\n“Mis' Greggory, the lame one?”\n\n“No; _Miss_ Greggory--Miss Alice.”\n\n“Oh! Yes'm.”\n\n“Then won't you ask her to come to the telephone, please.”\n\nThere was a moment's wait, during which Billy's small, well-shod foot\nbeat a nervous tattoo on the floor.\n\n“Oh, is that you, Alice?” she called then. “Are you going to be home for\nan hour or two?”\n\n“Why, y-yes; yes, indeed.”\n\n“Then I'm coming over. We'll play duets, sing--anything. I want some\nmusic.”\n\n“Do! And--Mr. Arkwright is here. He'll help.”\n\n“Mr. Arkwright? You say he's there? Then I won't--Yes, I will, too.”\n Billy spoke with renewed firmness. “I'll be there right away. Good-by.”\n And she hung up the receiver, and went to tell Pete to order John and\nPeggy at once.\n\n“I suppose I ought to have left Alice and Mr. Arkwright alone together,”\n muttered the young wife feverishly, as she hurriedly prepared for\ndeparture. “But I'll make it up to them later. I'm going to give them\nlots of chances. But to-day--to-day I just had to go--somewhere!”\n\nAt the Annex, with Alice Greggory and Arkwright, Billy sang duets and\ntrios, and reveled in a sonorous wilderness of new music to her heart's\ncontent. Then, rested, refreshed, and at peace with all the world, she\nhurried home to dinner and to Bertram.\n\n“There! I feel better,” she sighed, as she took off her hat in her\nown room; “and now I'll go find Bertram. Bless his heart--of course he\ndidn't want me to play when he was so busy!”\n\nBilly went straight to the studio, but Bertram was not there. Neither\nwas he in William's room, nor anywhere in the house. Down-stairs in\nthe dining-room Pete was found looking rather white, leaning back in\na chair. He struggled at once to his feet, however, as his mistress\nentered the room.\n\nBilly hurried forward with a startled exclamation.\n\n“Why, Pete, what is it? Are you sick?” she cried, her glance\nencompassing the half-set table.\n\n“No, ma'am; oh, no, ma'am!” The old man stumbled forward and began\nto arrange the knives and forks. “It's just a pesky pain--beggin' yer\npardon--in my side. But I ain't sick. No, Miss--ma'am.”\n\nBilly frowned and shook her head. Her eyes were on Pete's palpably\ntrembling hands.\n\n“But, Pete, you are sick,” she protested. “Let Eliza do that.”\n\nPete drew himself stiffly erect. The color had begun to come back to his\nface.\n\n“There hain't no one set this table much but me for more'n fifty years,\nan' I've got a sort of notion that nobody can do it just ter suit me.\nBesides, I'm better now. It's gone--that pain.”\n\n“But, Pete, what is it? How long have you had it?”\n\n“I hain't had it any time, steady. It's the comin' an' goin' kind. It\nseems silly ter mind it at all; only, when it does come, it sort o'\ntakes the backbone right out o' my knees, and they double up so's I\nhave ter set down. There, ye see? I'm pert as a sparrer, now!” And, with\nstiff celerity, Pete resumed his task.\n\nHis mistress still frowned.\n\n“That isn't right, Pete,” she demurred, with a slow shake of her head.\n“You should see a doctor.”\n\nThe old man paled a little. He had seen a doctor, and he had not liked\nwhat the doctor had told him. In fact, he stubbornly refused to\nbelieve what the doctor had said. He straightened himself now a little\naggressively.\n\n“Humph! Beggin' yer pardon, Miss--ma'am, but I don't think much o' them\ndoctor chaps.”\n\nBilly shook her head again as she smiled and turned away. Then, as if\ncasually, she asked:\n\n“Oh, did Mr. Bertram go out, Pete?”\n\n“Yes, Miss; about five o'clock. He said he'd be back to dinner.”\n\n“Oh! All right.”\n\nFrom the hall the telephone jangled sharply.\n\n“I'll go,” said Pete's mistress, as she turned and hurried up-stairs.\n\nIt was Bertram's voice that answered her opening “Hullo.”\n\n“Oh, Billy, is that you, dear? Well, you're just the one I wanted. I\nwanted to say--that is, I wanted to ask you--” The speaker cleared\nhis throat a little nervously, and began all over again. “The fact is,\nBilly, I've run across a couple of old classmates on from New York, and\nthey are very anxious I should stay down to dinner with them. Would you\nmind--very much if I did?”\n\nA cold hand seemed to clutch Billy's heart. She caught her breath with\na little gasp and tried to speak; but she had to try twice before the\nwords came.\n\n“Why, no--no, of course not!” Billy's voice was very high-pitched and a\nlittle shaky, but it was surpassingly cheerful.\n\n“You sure you won't be--lonesome?” Bertram's voice was vaguely troubled.\n\n“Of course not!”\n\n“You've only to say the word, little girl,” came Bertram's anxious tones\nagain, “and I won't stay.”\n\nBilly swallowed convulsively. If only, only he would _stop_ and leave\nher to herself! As if she were going to own up that _she_ was lonesome\nfor _him_--if _he_ was not lonesome for _her!_\n\n“Nonsense! of course you'll stay,” called Billy, still in that\nhigh-pitched, shaky treble. Then, before Bertram could answer, she\nuttered a gay “Good-by!” and hung up the receiver.\n\nBilly had ten whole minutes in which to cry before Pete's gong sounded\nfor dinner; but she had only one minute in which to try to efface the\nwoefully visible effects of those ten minutes before William tapped at\nher door, and called:\n\n“Gone to sleep, my dear? Dinner's ready. Didn't you hear the gong?”\n\n“Yes, I'm coming, Uncle William.” Billy spoke with breezy gayety, and\nthrew open the door; but she did not meet Uncle William's eyes. Her head\nwas turned away. Her hands were fussing with the hang of her skirt.\n\n“Bertram's dining out, Pete tells me,” observed William, with cheerful\nnonchalance, as they went down-stairs together.\n\nBilly bit her lip and looked up sharply. She had been bracing herself to\nmeet with disdainful indifference this man's pity--the pity due a poor\nneglected wife whose husband _preferred_ to dine with old classmates\nrather than with herself. Now she found in William's face, not pity, but\na calm, even jovial, acceptance of the situation as a matter of course.\nShe had known she was going to hate that pity; but now, curiously\nenough, she was conscious only of anger that the pity was not\nthere--that she might hate it.\n\nShe tossed her head a little. So even William--Uncle William--regarded\nthis monstrous thing as an insignificant matter of everyday experience.\nMaybe he expected it to occur frequently--every night, or so. Doubtless\nhe did expect it to occur every night, or so. Indeed! Very well. As if\nshe were going to show _now_ that she cared whether Bertram were there\nor not! They should see.\n\nSo with head held high and eyes asparkle, Billy marched into the\ndining-room and took her accustomed place.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE BIG BAD QUARREL\n\n\nIt was a brilliant dinner--because Billy made it so. At first William\nmet her sallies of wit with mild surprise; but it was not long before\nhe rose gallantly to the occasion, and gave back full measure of retort.\nEven Pete twice had to turn his back to hide a smile, and once his hand\nshook so that the tea he was carrying almost spilled. This threatened\ncatastrophe, however, seemed to frighten him so much that his face was\nvery grave throughout the rest of the dinner.\n\nStill laughing and talking gayly, Billy and Uncle William, after the\nmeal was over, ascended to the drawing-room. There, however, the man, in\nspite of the young woman's gay badinage, fell to dozing in the big chair\nbefore the fire, leaving Billy with only Spunkie for company--Spunkie,\nwho, disdaining every effort to entice her into a romp, only winked and\nblinked stupid eyes, and finally curled herself on the rug for a nap.\n\nBilly, left to her own devices, glanced at her watch.\n\nHalf-past seven! Time, almost, for Bertram to be coming. He had said\n“dinner”; and, of course, after dinner was over he would be coming\nhome--to her. Very well; she would show him that she had at least got\nalong without him as well as he had without her. At all events he\nwould not find her forlornly sitting with her nose pressed against the\nwindow-pane! And forthwith Billy established herself in a big chair\n(with its back carefully turned toward the door by which Bertram would\nenter), and opened a book.\n\nFive, ten, fifteen minutes passed. Billy fidgeted in her chair, twisted\nher neck to look out into the hall--and dropped her book with a bang.\n\nUncle William jerked himself awake, and Spunkie opened sleepy eyes. Then\nboth settled themselves for another nap. Billy sighed, picked up\nher book, and flounced back into her chair. But she did not read.\nDisconsolately she sat staring straight ahead--until a quick step on\nthe sidewalk outside stirred her into instant action. Assuming a look\nof absorbed interest she twitched the book open and held it before her\nface.... But the step passed by the door: and Billy saw then that her\nbook was upside down.\n\nFive, ten, fifteen more minutes passed. Billy still sat, apparently\nreading, though she had not turned a page. The book now, however, was\nright side up. One by one other minutes passed till the great clock in\nthe hall struck nine long strokes.\n\n“Well, well, bless my soul!” mumbled Uncle William, resolutely forcing\nhimself to wake up. “What time was that?”\n\n“Nine o'clock.” Billy spoke with tragic distinctness, yet very\ncheerfully.\n\n“Eh? Only nine?” blinked Uncle William. “I thought it must be ten. Well,\nanyhow, I believe I'll go up-stairs. I seem to be unusually sleepy.”\n\nBilly said nothing. “'Only nine,' indeed!” she was thinking wrathfully.\n\nAt the door Uncle William turned.\n\n“You're not going to sit up, my dear, of course,” he remarked.\n\nFor the second time that evening a cold hand seemed to clutch Billy's\nheart.\n\n_Sit up!_ Had it come already to that? Was she even now a wife who had\nneed to _sit up_ for her husband?\n\n“I really wouldn't, my dear,” advised Uncle William again. “Good night.”\n\n“Oh, but I'm not sleepy at all, yet,” Billy managed to declare brightly.\n“Good night.”\n\nThen Uncle William went up-stairs.\n\nBilly turned to her book, which happened to be one of William's on “Fake\nAntiques.”\n\n“'To collect anything, these days, requires expert knowledge, and the\nutmost care and discrimination,'” read Billy's eyes. “So Uncle William\n_expected_ Bertram was going to spend the whole evening as well as stay\nto dinner!” ran Billy's thoughts. “'The enormous quantity of bijouterie,\nDresden and Battersea enamel ware that is now flooding the market,\nis made on the Continent--and made chiefly for the American trade,'”\n continued the book.\n\n“Well, who cares if it is,” snapped Billy, springing to her feet and\ntossing the volume aside. “Spunkie, come here! You've simply got to play\nwith me. Do you hear? I want to be gay--_gay_--GAY! He's gay. He's down\nthere with those men, where he wants to be. Where he'd _rather_ be than\nbe with me! Do you think I want him to come home and find me moping over\na stupid old book? Not much! I'm going to have him find me gay, too.\nNow, come, Spunkie; hurry--wake up! He'll be here right away, I'm sure.”\n And Billy shook a pair of worsted reins, hung with little soft balls,\nfull in Spunkie's face.\n\nBut Spunkie would not wake up, and Spunkie would not play. She pretended\nto. She bit at the reins, and sank her sharp claws into the dangling\nballs. For a fleeting instant, even, something like mischief gleamed in\nher big yellow eyes. Then the jaws relaxed, the paws turned to velvet,\nand Spunkie's sleek gray head settled slowly back into lazy comfort.\nSpunkie was asleep.\n\nBilly gazed at the cat with reproachful eyes.\n\n“And you, too, Spunkie,” she murmured. Then she got to her feet and went\nback to her chair. This time she picked up a magazine and began to turn\nthe leaves very fast, one after another.\n\nHalf-past nine came, then ten. Pete appeared at the door to get Spunkie,\nand to see that everything was all right for the night.\n\n“Mr. Bertram is not in yet?” he began doubtfully.\n\nBilly shook her head with a bright smile.\n\n“No, Pete. Go to bed. I expect him every minute. Good night.”\n\n“Thank you, ma'am. Good night.”\n\nThe old man picked up the sleepy cat and went down-stairs. A little\nlater Billy heard his quiet steps coming back through the hall and\nascending the stairs. She listened until from away at the top of the\nhouse she heard his door close. Then she drew a long breath.\n\nTen o'clock--after ten o'clock, and Bertram not there yet! And was this\nwhat he called dinner? Did one eat, then, till ten o'clock, when one\ndined with one's friends?\n\nBilly was angry now--very angry. She was too angry to be reasonable.\nThis thing that her husband had done seemed monstrous to her, smarting,\nas she was, under the sting of hurt pride and grieved loneliness--the\nstate of mind into which she had worked herself. No longer now did she\nwish to be gay when her husband came. No longer did she even pretend to\nassume indifference. Bertram had done wrong. He had been unkind, cruel,\nthoughtless, inconsiderate of her comfort and happiness. Furthermore he\n_did not_ love her as well as she did him or he never, never could have\ndone it! She would let him see, when he came, just how hurt and grieved\nshe was--and how disappointed, too.\n\nBilly was walking the floor now, back and forth, back and forth.\n\nHalf-past ten came, then eleven. As the eleven long strokes reverberated\nthrough the silent house Billy drew in her breath and held it suspended.\nA new look came to her eyes. A growing terror crept into them and\nculminated in a frightened stare at the clock.\n\nBilly ran then to the great outer door and pulled it open. A cold wind\nstung her face, and caused her to shut the door quickly. Back and forth\nshe began to pace the floor again; but in five minutes she had run to\nthe door once more. This time she wore a heavy coat of Bertram's which\nshe caught up as she passed the hall-rack.\n\nOut on to the broad top step Billy hurried, and peered down the street.\nAs far as she could see not a person was in sight. Across the street in\nthe Public Garden the wind stirred the gray tree-branches and set them\nto casting weird shadows on the bare, frozen ground. A warning something\nbehind her sent Billy scurrying into the house just in time to prevent\nthe heavy door's closing and shutting her out, keyless, in the cold.\n\nHalf-past eleven came, and again Billy ran to the door. This time she\nput the floor-mat against the casing so that the door could not close.\nOnce more she peered wildly up and down the street, and across into the\ndeserted, wind-swept Garden.\n\nThere was only terror now in Billy's face. The anger was all gone. In\nBilly's mind there was not a shadow of doubt--something had happened to\nBertram.\n\nBertram was ill--hurt--dead! And he was so good, so kind, so noble; such\na dear, dear husband! If only she could see him once. If only she could\nask his forgiveness for those wicked, unkind, accusing thoughts. If only\nshe could tell him again that she did love him. If only--\n\nFar down the street a step rang sharply on the frosty air. A masculine\nfigure was hurrying toward the house. Retreating well into the shadow\nof the doorway, Billy watched it, her heart pounding against her side\nin great suffocating throbs. Nearer and nearer strode the approaching\nfigure until Billy had almost sprung to meet it with a glad cry--almost,\nbut not quite; for the figure neither turned nor paused, but marched\nstraight on--and Billy saw then, under the arc light, a brown-bearded\nman who was not Bertram at all.\n\nThree times during the next few minutes did the waiting little bride\non the doorstep watch with palpitating yearning a shadowy form appear,\napproach--and pass by. At the third heart-breaking disappointment, Billy\nwrung her hands helplessly.\n\n“I don't see how there can be--so many--utterly _useless_ people in the\nworld!” she choked. Then, thoroughly chilled and sick at heart, she went\ninto the house and closed the door.\n\nOnce again, back and forth, back and forth, Billy took up her weary\nvigil. She still wore the heavy coat. She had forgotten to take it off.\nHer face was pitifully white and drawn. Her eyes were wild. One of her\nhands was nervously caressing the rough sleeve of the coat as it hung\nfrom her shoulder.\n\n\nOne--two--three--\n\nBilly gave a sharp cry and ran into the hall.\n\nYes, it was twelve o'clock. And now, always, all the rest of the\ndreary, useless hours that that clock would tick away through an endless\nexistence, she would have to live--without Bertram. If only she could\nsee him once more! But she could not. He was dead. He must be dead, now.\nHere it was twelve o'clock, and--\n\nThere came a quick step, the click of a key in the lock, then the door\nswung back and Bertram, big, strong, and merry-eyed, stood before her.\n\n“Well, well, hullo,” he called jovially. “Why, Billy, what's the matter?”\n he broke off, in quite a different tone of voice.\n\nAnd then a curious thing happened. Billy, who, a minute before, had been\nseeing only a dear, noble, adorable, _lost_ Bertram, saw now suddenly\nonly the man that had stayed _happily_ till midnight with two friends,\nwhile she--she--\n\n“Matter! Matter!” exclaimed Billy sharply, then. “Is this what you call\nstaying to dinner, Bertram Henshaw?”\n\nBertram stared. A slow red stole to his forehead. It was his first\nexperience of coming home to meet angry eyes that questioned his\nbehavior--and he did not like it. He had been, perhaps, a little\nconscience-smitten when he saw how late he had stayed; and he had\nintended to say he was sorry, of course. But to be thus sharply\ncalled to account for a perfectly innocent good time with a couple of\nfriends--! To come home and find Billy making a ridiculous scene like\nthis--! He--he would not stand for it! He--\n\nBertram's lips snapped open. The angry retort was almost spoken when\nsomething in the piteously quivering chin and white, drawn face opposite\nstopped it just in time.\n\n“Why, Billy--darling!” he murmured instead.\n\nIt was Billy's turn to change. All the anger melted away before the\ndismayed tenderness in those dear eyes and the grieved hurt in that dear\nvoice.\n\n“Well, you--you--I--” Billy began to cry.\n\nIt was all right then, of course, for the next minute she was crying on\nBertram's big, broad shoulder; and in the midst of broken words, kisses,\ngentle pats, and inarticulate croonings, the Big, Bad Quarrel, that had\nbeen all ready to materialize, faded quite away into nothingness.\n\n“I didn't have such an awfully good time, anyhow,” avowed Bertram, when\nspeech became rational. “I'd rather have been home with you.”\n\n“Nonsense!” blinked Billy, valiantly. “Of course you had a good time;\nand it was perfectly right you should have it, too! And I--I hope you'll\nhave it again.”\n\n“I sha'n't,” emphasized Bertram, promptly, “--not and leave you!”\n\nBilly regarded him with adoring eyes.\n\n“I'll tell you; we'll have 'em come here,” she proposed gayly.\n\n“Sure we will,” agreed Bertram.\n\n“Yes; sure we will,” echoed Billy, with a contented sigh. Then, a little\nbreathlessly, she added: “Anyhow, I'll know--where you are. I won't\nthink you're--dead!”\n\n“You--blessed--little-goose!” scolded Bertram, punctuating each word\nwith a kiss.\n\nBilly drew a long sigh.\n\n“If this is a quarrel I'm going to have them often,” she announced\nplacidly.\n\n“Billy!” The young husband was plainly aghast.\n\n“Well, I am--because I like the making-up,” dimpled Billy, with a\nmischievous twinkle as she broke from his clasp and skipped ahead up the\nstairway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. BILLY CULTIVATES A “COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE”\n\n\nThe next morning, under the uncompromising challenge of a bright sun,\nBilly began to be uneasily suspicious that she had been just a bit\nunreasonable and exacting the night before. To make matters worse she\nchanced to run across a newspaper criticism of a new book bearing the\nominous title: “When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives.”\n\nSuch a title, of course, attracted her supersensitive attention at once;\nand, with a curiously faint feeling, she picked up the paper and began\nto read.\n\nAs the most of the criticism was taken up with quotations from the book,\nit was such sentences as these that met her startled eyes:\n\n“Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the\nrealization that while her husband loves her very much, he can still\nmake plans with his old friends which do not include herself.... Then is\nwhen the foolish wife lets her husband see how hurt she is that he can\nwant to be with any one but herself.... Then is when the husband--used\nall his life to independence, perhaps--begins to chafe under these new\nbonds that hold him so fast.... No man likes to be held up at the end of\na threatened scene and made to give an account of himself.... Before\na woman has learned to cultivate a comfortable indifference to her\nhusband's comings and goings, she is apt to be tyrannical and exacting.”\n\n“'Comfortable indifference,' indeed!” stormed Billy to herself. “As if I\never could be comfortably indifferent to anything Bertram did!”\n\nShe dropped the paper; but there were still other quotations from the\nbook there, she knew; and in a moment she was back at the table reading\nthem.\n\n“No man, however fondly he loves his wife, likes to feel that she is\neverlastingly peering into the recesses of his mind, and weighing his\nevery act to find out if he does or does not love her to-day as well as\nhe did yesterday at this time.... Then, when spontaneity is dead, she\nis the chief mourner at its funeral.... A few couples never leave the\nGarden of Eden. They grow old hand in hand. They are the ones who bear\nand forbear; who have learned to adjust themselves to the intimate\nrelationship of living together.... A certain amount of liberty, both of\naction and thought, must be allowed on each side.... The family shut in\nupon itself grows so narrow that all interest in the outside world\nis lost.... No two people are ever fitted to fill each other's lives\nentirely. They ought not to try to do it. If they do try, the process is\nbelittling to each, and the result, if it is successful, is nothing less\nthan a tragedy; for it could not mean the highest ideals, nor the truest\ndevotion.... Brushing up against other interests and other personalities\nis good for both husband and wife. Then to each other they bring the\nbest of what they have found, and each to the other continues to be new\nand interesting.... The young wife, however, is apt to be jealous of\neverything that turns her husband's attention for one moment away from\nherself. She is jealous of his thoughts, his words, his friends, even\nhis business.... But the wife who has learned to be the clinging vine\nwhen her husband wishes her to cling, and to be the sturdy oak when\nclinging vines would be tiresome, has solved a tremendous problem.”\n\nAt this point Billy dropped the paper. She flung it down, indeed, a bit\nangrily. There were still a few more words in the criticism, mostly the\ncritic's own opinion of the book; but Billy did not care for this. She\nhad read quite enough--boo much, in fact. All that sort of talk might\nbe very well, even necessary, perhaps (she told herself), for ordinary\nhusbands and wives! but for her and Bertram--\n\nThen vividly before her rose those initial quoted words:\n\n“Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the\nrealization that while her husband loves her very much, he can still\nmake plans with his old friends which do not include herself.”\n\nBilly frowned, and put her finger to her lips. Was that then, last\nnight, a “test”? Had she been “tyrannical and exacting”? Was she\n“everlastingly peering into the recesses” of Bertram's mind and\n“weighing his every act”? Was Bertram already beginning to “chafe” under\nthese new bonds that held him?\n\nNo, no, never that! She could not believe that. But what if he should\nsometime begin to chafe? What if they two should, in days to come,\ndegenerate into just the ordinary, everyday married folk, whom she saw\nabout her everywhere, and for whom just such horrid books as this must\nbe written? It was unbelievable, unthinkable. And yet, that man had\nsaid--\n\nWith a despairing sigh Billy picked up the paper once more and read\ncarefully every word again. When she had finished she stood soberly\nthoughtful, her eyes out of the window.\n\nAfter all, it was nothing but the same old story. She was exacting.\nShe did want her husband's every thought. She _gloried_ in peering into\nevery last recess of his mind if she had half a chance. She was jealous\nof his work. She had almost hated his painting--at times. She had held\nhim up with a threatened scene only the night before and demanded that\nhe should give an account of himself. She had, very likely, been the\nclinging vine when she should have been the sturdy oak.\n\nVery well, then. (Billy lifted her head and threw back her shoulders.)\nHe should have no further cause for complaint. She would be an oak. She\nwould cultivate that comfortable indifference to his comings and goings.\nShe would brush up against other interests and personalities so as to\nbe “new” and “interesting” to her husband. She would not be tyrannical,\nexacting, or jealous. She would not threaten scenes, nor peer into\nrecesses. Whatever happened, she would not let Bertram begin to chafe\nagainst those bonds!\n\nHaving arrived at this heroic and (to her) eminently satisfactory state\nof mind, Billy turned from the window and fell to work on a piece of\nmanuscript music.\n\n“'Brush up against other interests,'” she admonished herself sternly, as\nshe reached for her pen.\n\nTheoretically it was beautiful; but practically--\n\nBilly began at once to be that oak. Not an hour after she had first seen\nthe fateful notice of “When the Honeymoon Wanes,” Bertram's ring sounded\nat the door down-stairs.\n\nBertram always let himself in with his latchkey; but, from the first\nof Billy's being there, he had given a peculiar ring at the bell which\nwould bring his wife flying to welcome him if she were anywhere in the\nhouse. To-day, when the bell sounded, Billy sprang as usual to her feet,\nwith a joyous “There's Bertram!” But the next moment she fell back.\n\n“Tut, tut, Billy Neilson Henshaw! Learn to cultivate a comfortable\nindifference to your husband's comings and goings,” she whispered\nfiercely. Then she sat down and fell to work again.\n\nA moment later she heard her husband's voice talking to some one--Pete,\nshe surmised. “Here? You say she's here?” Then she heard Bertram's quick\nstep on the stairs. The next minute, very quietly, he came to her door.\n\n“Ho!” he ejaculated gayly, as she rose to receive his kiss. “I thought\nI'd find you asleep, when you didn't hear my ring.”\n\nBilly reddened a little.\n\n“Oh, no, I wasn't asleep.”\n\n“But you didn't hear--” Bertram stopped abruptly, an odd look in his\neyes. “Maybe you did hear it, though,” he corrected.\n\nBilly colored more confusedly. The fact that she looked so distressed\ndid not tend to clear Bertram's face.\n\n“Why, of course, Billy, I didn't mean to insist on your coming to meet\nme,” he began a little stiffly; but Billy interrupted him.\n\n“Why, Bertram, I just love to go to meet you,” she maintained\nindignantly. Then, remembering just in time, she amended: “That is,\nI did love to meet you, until--” With a sudden realization that she\ncertainly had not helped matters any, she came to an embarrassed pause.\n\nA puzzled frown showed on Bertram's face.\n\n“You did love to meet me until--” he repeated after her; then his face\nchanged. “Billy, you aren't--you _can't_ be laying up last night against\nme!” he reproached her a little irritably.\n\n“Last night? Why, of course not,” retorted Billy, in a panic at the\nbare mention of the “test” which--according to “When the Honeymoon\nWanes”--was at the root of all her misery. Already she thought she\ndetected in Bertram's voice signs that he was beginning to chafe against\nthose “bonds.” “It is a matter of--of the utmost indifference to me what\ntime you come home at night, my dear,” she finished airily, as she sat\ndown to her work again.\n\nBertram stared; then he frowned, turned on his heel and left the room.\nBertram, who knew nothing of the “Talk to Young Wives” in the newspaper\nat Billy's feet, was surprised, puzzled, and just a bit angry.\n\nBilly, left alone, jabbed her pen with such force against her paper that\nthe note she was making became an unsightly blot.\n\n“Well, if this is what that man calls being 'comfortably indifferent,'\nI'd hate to try the _un_comfortable kind,” she muttered with emphasis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE DINNER BILLY TRIED TO GET\n\n\nNotwithstanding what Billy was disposed to regard as the non-success\nof her first attempt to profit by the “Talk to Young Wives;” she still\nfrantically tried to avert the waning of her honeymoon. Assiduously she\ncultivated the prescribed “indifference,” and with at least apparent\nenthusiasm she sought the much-to-be-desired “outside interests.” That\nis, she did all this when she thought of it when something reminded her\nof the sword of destruction hanging over her happiness. At other times,\nwhen she was just being happy without question, she was her old self\nimpulsive, affectionate, and altogether adorable.\n\nNaturally, under these circumstances, her conduct was somewhat erratic.\nFor three days, perhaps, she would fly to the door at her husband's\nring, and hang upon his every movement. Then, for the next three,\nshe would be a veritable will-o'-the-wisp for elusiveness, caring,\napparently, not one whit whether her husband came or went until poor\nBertram, at his wit's end, scourged himself with a merciless catechism\nas to what he had done to vex her. Then, perhaps, just when he had\nnerved himself almost to the point of asking her what was the trouble,\nthere would come another change, bringing back to him the old Billy,\njoyous, winsome, and devoted, plainly caring nothing for anybody or\nanything but himself. Scarcely, however, would he become sure that it\nwas his Billy back again before she was off once more, quite beyond his\nreach, singing with Arkwright and Alice Greggory, playing with Tommy\nDunn, plunging into some club or church work--anything but being with\nhim.\n\nThat all this was puzzling and disquieting to Bertram, Billy not once\nsuspected. Billy, so far as she was concerned, was but cultivating a\ncomfortable indifference, brushing up against outside interests, and\nbeing an oak.\n\nDecember passed, and January came, bringing Miss Marguerite Winthrop to\nher Boston home. Bertram's arm was “as good as ever” now, according to\nits owner; and the sittings for the new portrait began at once. This\nleft Billy even more to her own devices, for Bertram entered into his\nnew work with an enthusiasm born of a glad relief from forced idleness,\nand a consuming eagerness to prove that even though he had failed the\nfirst time, he could paint a portrait of Marguerite Winthrop that would\nbe a credit to himself, a conclusive retort to his critics, and a source\nof pride to his once mortified friends. With his whole heart, therefore,\nhe threw himself into the work before him, staying sometimes well into\nthe afternoon on the days Miss Winthrop could find time between her\nsocial engagements to give him a sitting.\n\nIt was on such a day, toward the middle of the month, that Billy was\ncalled to the telephone at half-past twelve o'clock to speak to her\nhusband.\n\n“Billy, dear,” began Bertram at once, “if you don't mind I'm staying\nto luncheon at Miss Winthrop's kind request. We've changed the\npose--neither of us was satisfied, you know--but we haven't quite\nsettled on the new one. Miss Winthrop has two whole hours this\nafternoon that she can give me if I'll stay; and, of course, under the\ncircumstances, I want to do it.”\n\n“Of course,” echoed Billy. Billy's voice was indomitably cheerful.\n\n“Thank you, dear. I knew you'd understand,” sighed Bertram, contentedly.\n“You see, really, two whole hours, so--it's a chance I can't afford to\nlose.”\n\n“Of course you can't,” echoed Billy, again.\n\n“All right then. Good-by till to-night,” called the man.\n\n“Good-by,” answered Billy, still cheerfully. As she turned away,\nhowever, she tossed her head. “A new pose, indeed!” she muttered, with\nsome asperity. “Just as if there could be a _new_ pose after all those\nshe tried last year!”\n\nImmediately after luncheon Pete and Eliza started for South Boston to\npay a visit to Eliza's mother, and it was soon after they left the house\nthat Bertram called his wife up again.\n\n“Say, dearie, I forgot to tell you,” he began, “but I met an old friend\nin the subway this morning, and I--well, I remembered what you said\nabout bringing 'em home to dinner next time, so I asked him for\nto-night. Do you mind? It's--”\n\n“Mind? Of course not! I'm glad you did,” plunged in Billy, with feverish\neagerness. (Even now, just the bare mention of anything connected with\nthat awful “test” night was enough to set Billy's nerves to tingling.)\n“I want you to always bring them home, Bertram.”\n\n“All right, dear. We'll be there at six o'clock then. It's--it's\nCalderwell, this time. You remember Calderwell, of course.”\n\n“Not--_Hugh_ Calderwell?” Billy's question was a little faint.\n\n“Sure!” Bertram laughed oddly, and lowered his voice. “I suspect\n_once_ I wouldn't have brought him home to you. I was too jealous. But\nnow--well, now maybe I want him to see what he's lost.”\n\n“_Bertram!_”\n\nBut Bertram only laughed mischievously, and called a gay “Good-by till\nto-night, then!”\n\nBilly, at her end of the wires, hung up the receiver and backed against\nthe wall a little palpitatingly.\n\nCalderwell! To dinner--Calderwell! Did she remember Calderwell? Did she,\nindeed! As if one could easily forget the man that, for a year or two,\nhad proposed marriage as regularly (and almost as lightly!) as he had\ntorn a monthly leaf from his calendar! Besides, was it not he, too, who\nhad said that Bertram would never love any girl, _really_; that it would\nbe only the tilt of her chin or the turn of her head that he loved--to\npaint? And now he was coming to dinner--and with Bertram.\n\nVery well, he should see! He should see that Bertram _did_ love her;\n_her_--not the tilt of her chin nor the turn of her head. He should\nsee how happy they were, what a good wife she made, and how devoted and\n_satisfied_ Bertram was in his home. He should see! And forthwith Billy\npicked up her skirts and tripped up-stairs to select her very prettiest\nhouse-gown to do honor to the occasion. Up-stairs, however, one thing\nand another delayed her, so that it was four o'clock when she turned her\nattention to her toilet; and it was while she was hesitating whether to\nbe stately and impressive in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine,\nor cozy and tantalizingly homy{sic} in bronze-gold crêpe de Chine and\nswan's-down, that the telephone bell rang again.\n\nEliza and Pete had not yet returned; so, as before, Billy answered it.\nThis time Eliza's shaking voice came to her.\n\n“Is that you, ma'am?”\n\n“Why, yes, Eliza?”\n\n“Yes'm, it's me, ma'am. It's about Uncle Pete. He's give us a turn\nthat's 'most scared us out of our wits.”\n\n“Pete! You mean he's sick?”\n\n“Yes, ma'am, he was. That is, he is, too--only he's better, now, thank\ngoodness,” panted Eliza. “But he ain't hisself yet. He's that white and\nshaky! Would you--could you--that is, would you mind if we didn't come\nback till into the evenin', maybe?”\n\n“Why, of course not,” cried Pete's mistress, quickly. “Don't come a\nminute before he's able, Eliza. Don't come until to-morrow.”\n\nEliza gave a trembling little laugh.\n\n“Thank you, ma'am; but there wouldn't be no keepin' of Uncle Pete here\ntill then. If he could take five steps alone he'd start now. But he\ncan't. He says he'll be all right pretty quick, though. He's had 'em\nbefore--these spells--but never quite so bad as this, I guess; an' he's\nworryin' somethin' turrible 'cause he can't start for home right away.”\n\n“Nonsense!” cut in Mrs. Bertram Henshaw.\n\n“Yes'm. I knew you'd feel that way,” stammered Eliza, gratefully. “You\nsee, I couldn't leave him to come alone, and besides, anyhow, I'd have\nto stay, for mother ain't no more use than a wet dish-rag at such times,\nshe's that scared herself. And she ain't very well, too. So if--if you\n_could_ get along--”\n\n“Of course we can! And tell Pete not to worry one bit. I'm so sorry he's\nsick!”\n\n“Thank you, ma'am. Then we'll be there some time this evenin',” sighed\nEliza.\n\nFrom the telephone Billy turned away with a troubled face.\n\n“Pete _is_ ill,” she was saying to herself. “I don't like the looks of\nit; and he's so faithful he'd come if--” With a little cry Billy\nstopped short. Then, tremblingly, she sank into the nearest chair.\n“Calderwell--and he's coming to _dinner!_” she moaned.\n\nFor two benumbed minutes Billy sat staring at nothing. Then she ran to\nthe telephone and called the Annex.\n\nAunt Hannah answered.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, for heaven's sake, if you love me,” pleaded Billy, “send\nRosa down instanter! Pete is sick over to South Boston, and Eliza is\nwith him; and Bertram is bringing Hugh Calderwell home to dinner. _Can_\nyou spare Rosa?”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy! Of course I can--I mean I\ncould--but Rosa isn't here, dear child! It's her day out, you know.”\n\n“O dear, of course it is! I might have known, if I'd thought; but Pete\nand Eliza have spoiled me. They never take days out at meal time--both\ntogether, I mean--until to-night.”\n\n“But, my dear child, what will you do?”\n\n“I don't know. I've got to think. I _must_ do something!”\n\n“Of course you must! I'd come over myself if it wasn't for my cold.”\n\n“As if I'd let you!”\n\n“There isn't anybody here, only Tommy. Even Alice is gone. Oh, Billy,\nBilly, this only goes to prove what I've always said, that _no_ woman\n_ought_ to be a wife until she's an efficient housekeeper; and--”\n\n“Yes, yes, Aunt Hannah, I know,” moaned Billy, frenziedly. “But I am a\nwife, and I'm not an efficient housekeeper; and Hugh Calderwell won't\nwait for me to learn. He's coming to-night. _To-night!_ And I've got to\ndo something. Never mind. I'll fix it some way. Good-by!”\n\n“But, Billy, Billy! Oh, my grief and conscience,” fluttered Aunt\nHannah's voice across the wires as Billy snapped the receiver into\nplace.\n\nFor the second time that day Billy backed palpitatingly against the\nwall. Her eyes sought the clock fearfully.\n\nFifteen minutes past four. She had an hour and three quarters. She\ncould, of course, telephone Bertram to dine Calderwell at a club or some\nhotel. But to do this now, the very first time, when it had been her\nown suggestion that he “bring them home”--no, no, she could not do that!\nAnything but that! Besides, very likely she could not reach Bertram,\nanyway. Doubtless he had left the Winthrops' by this time.\n\nThere was Marie. She could telephone Marie. But Marie could not very\nwell come just now, she knew; and then, too, there was Cyril to be taken\ninto consideration. How Cyril would gibe at the wife who had to call in\nall the neighbors just because her husband was bringing home a friend to\ndinner! How he would--Well, he shouldn't! He should not have the chance.\nSo, there!\n\nWith a jerk Mrs. Bertram Henshaw pulled herself away from the wall and\nstood erect. Her eyes snapped, and the very poise of her chin spelled\ndetermination.\n\nVery well, she would show them. Was not Bertram bringing this man home\nbecause he was proud of her? Mighty proud he would be if she had to call\nin half of Boston to get his dinner for him! Nonsense! She would get\nit herself. Was not this the time, if ever, to be an oak? A vine,\ndoubtless, would lean and cling and telephone, and whine “I can't!” But\nnot an oak. An oak would hold up its head and say “I can!” An oak would\ngo ahead and get that dinner. She would be an oak. She would get that\ndinner.\n\nWhat if she didn't know how to cook bread and cake and pies and\nthings? One did not have to cook bread and cake and pies just to get\na dinner--meat and potatoes and vegetables! Besides, she _could_ make\npeach fritters. She knew she could. She would show them!\n\nAnd with actually a bit of song on her lips, Billy skipped up-stairs\nfor her ruffled apron and dust-cap--two necessary accompaniments to this\ndinner-getting, in her opinion.\n\nBilly found the apron and dust-cap with no difficulty; but it took fully\nten of her precious minutes to unearth from its obscure hiding-place the\nblue-and-gold “Bride's Helper” cookbook, one of Aunt Hannah's wedding\ngifts.\n\nOn the way to the kitchen, Billy planned her dinner. As was natural,\nperhaps, she chose the things she herself would like to eat.\n\n“I won't attempt anything very elaborate,” she said to herself. “It\nwould be wiser to have something simple, like chicken pie, perhaps. I\nlove chicken pie! And I'll have oyster stew first--that is, after the\ngrapefruit. Just oysters boiled in milk must be easier than soup to\nmake. I'll begin with grapefruit with a cherry in it, like Pete fixes\nit. Those don't have to be cooked, anyhow. I'll have fish--Bertram loves\nthe fish course. Let me see, halibut, I guess, with egg sauce. I won't\nhave any roast; nothing but the chicken pie. And I'll have squash and\nonions. I can have a salad, easy--just lettuce and stuff. That doesn't\nhave to be cooked. Oh, and the peach fritters, if I get time to make\nthem. For dessert--well, maybe I can find a new pie or pudding in the\ncookbook. I want to use that cookbook for something, after hunting all\nthis time for it!”\n\nIn the kitchen Billy found exquisite neatness, and silence. The first\nbrought an approving light to her eyes; but the second, for some\nunapparent reason, filled her heart with vague misgiving. This feeling,\nhowever, Billy resolutely cast from her as she crossed the room, dropped\nher book on to the table, and turned toward the shining black stove.\n\nThere was an excellent fire. Glowing points of light showed that only\na good draft was needed to make the whole mass of coal red-hot. Billy,\nhowever, did not know this. Her experience of fires was confined to\nburning wood in open grates--and wood in open grates had to be poked to\nmake it red and glowing. With confident alacrity now, therefore, Billy\ncaught up the poker, thrust it into the mass of coals and gave them a\nfine stirring up. Then she set back the lid of the stove and went to\nhunt up the ingredients for her dinner.\n\nBy the time Billy had searched five minutes and found no chicken, no\noysters, and no halibut, it occurred to her that her larder was not,\nafter all, an open market, and that one's provisions must be especially\nordered to fit one's needs. As to ordering them now--Billy glanced at\nthe clock and shook her head.\n\n“It's almost five, already, and they'd never get here in time,” she\nsighed regretfully. “I'll have to have something else.”\n\nBilly looked now, not for what she wanted, but for what she could find.\nAnd she found: some cold roast lamb, at which she turned up her nose; an\nuncooked beefsteak, which she appropriated doubtfully; a raw turnip and\na head of lettuce, which she hailed with glee; and some beets, potatoes,\nonions, and grapefruit, from all of which she took a generous supply.\nThus laden she went back to the kitchen.\n\nSpread upon the table they made a brave show.\n\n“Oh, well, I'll have quite a dinner, after all,” she triumphed, cocking\nher head happily. “And now for the dessert,” she finished, pouncing on\nthe cookbook.\n\nIt was while she was turning the leaves to find the pies and puddings\nthat she ran across the vegetables and found the word “beets” staring\nher in the face. Mechanically she read the line below.\n\n“Winter beets will require three hours to cook. Use hot water.”\n\nBilly's startled eyes sought the clock.\n\nThree hours--and it was five, now!\n\nFrenziedly, then, she ran her finger down the page.\n\n“Onions, one and one-half hours. Use hot water. Turnips require a long\ntime, but if cut thin they will cook in an hour and a quarter.”\n\n“An hour and a quarter, indeed!” she moaned.\n\n“Isn't there anything anywhere that doesn't take forever to cook?”\n\n“Early peas--... green corn--... summer squash--...” mumbled Billy's dry\nlips. “But what do folks eat in January--_January_?”\n\nIt was the apparently inoffensive sentence, “New potatoes will boil in\nthirty minutes,” that brought fresh terror to Billy's soul, and set her\nto fluttering the cookbook leaves with renewed haste. If it took _new_\npotatoes thirty minutes to cook, how long did it take old ones? In vain\nshe searched for the answer. There were plenty of potatoes. They were\nmashed, whipped, scalloped, creamed, fried, and broiled; they were made\ninto puffs, croquettes, potato border, and potato snow. For many of\nthese they were boiled first--“until tender,” one rule said.\n\n“But that doesn't tell me how long it takes to get 'em tender,” fumed\nBilly, despairingly. “I suppose they think anybody ought to know\nthat--but I don't!” Suddenly her eyes fell once more on the instructions\nfor boiling turnips, and her face cleared. “If it helps to cut turnips\nthin, why not potatoes?” she cried. “I _can_ do that, anyhow; and I\nwill,” she finished, with a sigh of relief, as she caught up half a\ndozen potatoes and hurried into the pantry for a knife. A few minutes\nlater, the potatoes, peeled, and cut almost to wafer thinness, were\ndumped into a basin of cold water.\n\n“There! now I guess you'll cook,” nodded Billy to the dish in her hand\nas she hurried to the stove.\n\nChilled by an ominous unresponsiveness, Billy lifted the stove lid and\npeered inside. Only a mass of black and graying coals greeted her. The\nfire was out.\n\n“To think that even you had to go back on me like this!” upbraided\nBilly, eyeing the dismal mass with reproachful gaze.\n\nThis disaster, however, as Billy knew, was not so great as it seemed,\nfor there was still the gas stove. In the old days, under Dong Ling's\nrule, there had been no gas stove. Dong Ling disapproved of “devil\nstoves” that had “no coalee, no woodee, but burned like hellee.” Eliza,\nhowever, did approve of them; and not long after her arrival, a fine one\nhad been put in for her use. So now Billy soon had her potatoes with a\nbrisk blaze under them.\n\nIn frantic earnest, then, Billy went to work. Brushing the discarded\nonions, turnip, and beets into a pail under the table, she was still\nconfronted with the beefsteak, lettuce, and grapefruit. All but the\nbeefsteak she pushed to one side with gentle pats.\n\n“You're all right,” she nodded to them. “I can use you. You don't have\nto be cooked, bless your hearts! But _you_--!” Billy scowled at\nthe beefsteak and ran her finger down the index of the “Bride's\nHelper”--Billy knew how to handle that book now.\n\n“No, you don't--not for me!” she muttered, after a minute, shaking her\nfinger at the tenderloin on the table. “I haven't got any 'hot coals,'\nand I thought a 'gridiron' was where they played football; though it\nseems it's some sort of a dish to cook you in, here--but I shouldn't\nknow it from a teaspoon, probably, if I should see it. No, sir! It's\nback to the refrigerator for you, and a nice cold sensible roast leg of\nlamb for me, that doesn't have to be cooked. Understand? _Cooked_,” she\nfinished, as she carried the beefsteak away and took possession of the\nhitherto despised cold lamb.\n\nOnce more Billy made a mad search through cupboards and shelves. This\ntime she bore back in triumph a can of corn, another of tomatoes, and\na glass jar of preserved peaches. In the kitchen a cheery bubbling from\nthe potatoes on the stove greeted her. Billy's spirits rose with the\nsteam.\n\n“There, Spunkie,” she said gayly to the cat, who had just uncurled from\na nap behind the stove. “Tell me I can't get up a dinner! And maybe\nwe'll have the peach fritters, too,” she chirped. “I've got the\npeach-part, anyway.”\n\nBut Billy did not have the peach fritters, after all. She got out the\nsugar and the flour, to be sure, and she made a great ado looking up the\nrule; but a hurried glance at the clock sent her into the dining-room to\nset the table, and all thought of the peach fritters was given up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE DINNER BILLY GOT\n\n\nAt five minutes of six Bertram and Calderwell came. Bertram gave his\npeculiar ring and let himself in with his latchkey; but Billy did not\nmeet him in the hall, nor in the drawing-room. Excusing himself, Bertram\nhurried up-stairs. Billy was not in her room, nor anywhere on that\nfloor. She was not in William's room. Coming down-stairs to the hall\nagain, Bertram confronted William, who had just come in.\n\n“Where's Billy?” demanded the young husband, with just a touch of\nirritation, as if he suspected William of having Billy in his pocket.\n\nWilliam stared slightly.\n\n“Why, I don't know. Isn't she here?”\n\n“I'll ask Pete,” frowned Bertram.\n\nIn the dining-room Bertram found no one, though the table was prettily\nset, and showed half a grapefruit at each place. In the kitchen--in the\nkitchen Bertram found a din of rattling tin, an odor of burned food--, a\nconfusion of scattered pots and pans, a frightened cat who peered at him\nfrom under a littered stove, and a flushed, disheveled young woman in a\nblue dust-cap and ruffled apron, whom he finally recognized as his wife.\n\n“Why, Billy!” he gasped.\n\nBilly, who was struggling with something at the sink, turned sharply.\n\n“Bertram Henshaw,” she panted, “I used to think you were wonderful\nbecause you could paint a picture. I even used to think I was a little\nwonderful because I could write a song. Well, I don't any more! But I'll\ntell you who _is_ wonderful. It's Eliza and Rosa, and all the rest of\nthose women who can get a meal on to the table all at once, so it's fit\nto eat!”\n\n“Why, Billy!” gasped Bertram again, falling back to the door he had\nclosed behind him. “What in the world does this mean?”\n\n“Mean? It means I'm getting dinner,” choked Billy. “Can't you see?”\n\n“But--Pete! Eliza!”\n\n“They're sick--I mean he's sick; and I said I'd do it. I'd be an oak.\nBut how did I know there wasn't anything in the house except stuff that\ntook hours to cook--only potatoes? And how did I know that _they_ cooked\nin no time, and then got all smushy and wet staying in the water? And\nhow did I know that everything else would stick on and burn on till\nyou'd used every dish there was in the house to cook 'em in?”\n\n“Why, Billy!” gasped Bertram, for the third time. And then, because\nhe had been married only six months instead of six years, he made the\nmistake of trying to argue with a woman whose nerves were already at the\nsnapping point. “But, dear, it was so foolish of you to do all this! Why\ndidn't you telephone? Why didn't you get somebody?”\n\nLike an irate little tigress, Billy turned at bay.\n\n“Bertram Henshaw,” she flamed angrily, “if you don't go up-stairs and\ntend to that man up there, I shall _scream_. Now go! I'll be up when I\ncan.”\n\nAnd Bertram went.\n\nIt was not so very long, after all, before Billy came in to greet her\nguest. She was not stately and imposing in royally sumptuous blue velvet\nand ermine; nor yet was she cozy and homy in bronze-gold crêpe de\nChine and swan's-down. She was just herself in a pretty little morning\nhouse gown of blue gingham. She was minus the dust-cap and the ruffled\napron, but she had a dab of flour on the left cheek, and a smutch of\ncrock on her forehead. She had, too, a cut finger on her right hand,\nand a burned thumb on her left. But she was Billy--and being Billy,\nshe advanced with a bright smile and held out a cordial hand--not even\nwincing when the cut finger came under Calderwell's hearty clasp.\n\n“I'm glad to see you,” she welcomed him. “You'll excuse my not appearing\nsooner, I'm sure, for--didn't Bertram tell you?--I'm playing Bridget\nto-night. But dinner is ready now, and we'll go down, please,” she\nsmiled, as she laid a light hand on her guest's arm.\n\nBehind her, Bertram, remembering the scene in the kitchen, stared in\nsheer amazement. Bertram, it might be mentioned again, had been married\nsix months, not six years.\n\nWhat Billy had intended to serve for a “simple dinner” that night was:\ngrapefruit with cherries, oyster stew, boiled halibut with egg sauce,\nchicken pie, squash, onions, and potatoes, peach fritters, a “lettuce\nand stuff” salad, and some new pie or pudding. What she did serve was:\ngrapefruit (without the cherries), cold roast lamb, potatoes (a mush of\nsogginess), tomatoes (canned, and slightly burned), corn (canned, and\nvery much burned), lettuce (plain); and for dessert, preserved peaches\nand cake (the latter rather dry and stale). Such was Billy's dinner.\n\nThe grapefruit everybody ate. The cold lamb too, met with a hearty\nreception, especially after the potatoes, corn, and tomatoes were\nserved--and tasted. Outwardly, through it all, Billy was gayety itself.\nInwardly she was burning up with anger and mortification. And because\nshe was all this, there was, apparently, no limit to her laughter and\nsparkling repartee as she talked with Calderwell, her guest--the guest\nwho, according to her original plans, was to be shown how happy she and\nBertram were, what a good wife she made, and how devoted and _satisfied_\nBertram was in his home.\n\nWilliam, picking at his dinner--as only a hungry man can pick at a\ndinner that is uneatable--watched Billy with a puzzled, uneasy frown.\nBertram, choking over the few mouthfuls he ate, marked his wife's\nanimated face and Calderwell's absorbed attention, and settled into\ngloomy silence.\n\nBut it could not continue forever. The preserved peaches were eaten at\nlast, and the stale cake left. (Billy had forgotten the coffee--which\nwas just as well, perhaps.) Then the four trailed up-stairs to the\ndrawing-room.\n\nAt nine o'clock an anxious Eliza and a remorseful, apologetic Pete\ncame home and descended to the horror the once orderly kitchen\nand dining-room had become. At ten, Calderwell, with very evident\nreluctance, tore himself away from Billy's gay badinage, and said good\nnight. At two minutes past ten, an exhausted, nerve-racked Billy was\ntrying to cry on the shoulders of both Uncle William and Bertram at\nonce.\n\n“There, there, child, don't! It went off all right,” patted Uncle\nWilliam.\n\n“Billy, darling,” pleaded Bertram, “please don't cry so! As if I'd ever\nlet you step foot in that kitchen again!”\n\nAt this Billy raised a tear-wet face, aflame with indignant\ndetermination.\n\n“As if I'd ever let you keep me _from_ it, Bertram Henshaw, after this!”\n she contested. “I'm not going to do another thing in all my life but\n_cook!_ When I think of the stuff we had to eat, after all the time I\ntook to get it, I'm simply crazy! Do you think I'd run the risk of such\na thing as this ever happening again?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. CALDERWELL DOES SOME QUESTIONING\n\n\nOn the day after his dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw, Hugh\nCalderwell left Boston and did not return until more than a month had\npassed. One of his first acts, when he did come, was to look up Mr. M.\nJ. Arkwright at the address which Billy had given him.\n\nCalderwell had not seen Arkwright since they parted in Paris some\ntwo years before, after a six-months tramp through Europe together.\nCalderwell liked Arkwright then, greatly, and he lost no time now in\nrenewing the acquaintance.\n\nThe address, as given by Billy, proved to be an attractive but modest\napartment hotel near the Conservatory of Music; and Calderwell was\ndelighted to find Arkwright at home in his comfortable little bachelor\nsuite.\n\nArkwright greeted him most cordially.\n\n“Well, well,” he cried, “if it isn't Calderwell! And how's Mont Blanc?\nOr is it the Killarney Lakes this time, or maybe the Sphinx that I\nshould inquire for, eh?”\n\n“Guess again,” laughed Calderwell, throwing off his heavy coat and\nsettling himself comfortably in the inviting-looking morris chair his\nfriend pulled forward.\n\n“Sha'n't do it,” retorted Arkwright, with a smile. “I never gamble on\npalpable uncertainties, except for a chance throw or two, as I gave\na minute ago. Your movements are altogether too erratic, and too\nfar-reaching, for ordinary mortals to keep track of.”\n\n“Well, maybe you're right,” grinned Calderwell, appreciatively. “Anyhow,\nyou would have lost this time, sure thing, for I've been working.”\n\n“Seen the doctor yet?” queried Arkwright, coolly, pushing the cigars\nacross the table.\n\n“Thanks--for both,” sniffed Calderwell, with a reproachful glance,\nhelping himself. “Your good judgment in some matters is still\nunimpaired, I see,” he observed, tapping the little gilded band which\nhad told him the cigar was an old favorite. “As to other matters,\nhowever,--you're wrong again, my friend, in your surmise. I am not sick,\nand I have been working.”\n\n“So? Well, I'm told they have very good specialists here. Some one\nof them ought to hit your case. Still--how long has it been running?”\n Arkwright's face showed only grave concern.\n\n“Oh, come, let up, Arkwright,” snapped Calderwell, striking his match\nalight with a vigorous jerk. “I'll admit I haven't ever given any\n_special_ indication of an absorbing passion for work. But what can you\nexpect of a fellow born with a whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth?\nAnd that's what I was, according to Bertram Henshaw. According to him\nagain, it's a wonder I ever tried to feed myself; and perhaps he's\nright--with my mouth already so full.”\n\n“I should say so,” laughed Arkwright.\n\n“Well, be that as it may. I'm going to feed myself, and I'm going to\nearn my feed, too. I haven't climbed a mountain or paddled a canoe, for\na year. I've been in Chicago cultivating the acquaintance of John Doe\nand Richard Roe.”\n\n“You mean--law?”\n\n“Sure. I studied it here for a while, before that bout of ours a couple\nof years ago. Billy drove me away, then.”\n\n“Billy!--er--Mrs. Henshaw?”\n\n“Yes. I thought I told you. She turned down my tenth-dozen proposal so\nemphatically that I lost all interest in Boston and took to the tall\ntimber again. But I've come back. A friend of my father's wrote me to\ncome on and consider a good opening there was in his law office. I came\non a month ago, and considered. Then I went back to pack up. Now I've\ncome for good, and here I am. You have my history to date. Now tell me\nof yourself. You're looking as fit as a penny from the mint, even though\nyou have discarded that 'lovely' brown beard. Was that a concession\nto--er--_Mary Jane_?”\n\nArkwright lifted a quick hand of protest.\n\n“'Michael Jeremiah,' please. There is no 'Mary Jane,' now,” he said a\nbit stiffly.\n\nThe other stared a little. Then he gave a low chuckle.\n\n“'Michael Jeremiah,'” he repeated musingly, eyeing the glowing tip of\nhis cigar. “And to think how that mysterious 'M. J.' used to tantalize\nme! Do you mean,” he added, turning slowly, “that no one calls you 'Mary\nJane' now?”\n\n“Not if they know what is best for them.”\n\n“Oh!” Calderwell noted the smouldering fire in the other's eyes a little\ncuriously. “Very well. I'll take the hint--Michael Jeremiah.”\n\n“Thanks.” Arkwright relaxed a little. “To tell the truth, I've had quite\nenough now--of Mary Jane.”\n\n“Very good. So be it,” nodded the other, still regarding his friend\nthoughtfully. “But tell me--what of yourself?”\n\nArkwright shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“There's nothing to tell. You've seen. I'm here.”\n\n“Humph! Very pretty,” scoffed Calderwell. “Then if _you_ won't tell, I\n_will_. I saw Billy a month ago, you see. It seems you've hit the trail\nfor Grand Opera, as you threatened to that night in Paris; but you\n_haven't_ brought up in vaudeville, as you prophesied you would\ndo--though, for that matter, judging from the plums some of the stars\nare picking on the vaudeville stage, nowadays, that isn't to be sneezed\nat. But Billy says you've made two or three appearances already on the\nsacred boards themselves--one of them a subscription performance--and\nthat you created no end of a sensation.”\n\n“Nonsense! I'm merely a student at the Opera School here,” scowled\nArkwright.\n\n“Oh, yes, Billy said you were that, but she also said you wouldn't\nbe, long. That you'd already had one good offer--I'm not speaking of\nmarriage--and that you were going abroad next summer, and that they were\nall insufferably proud of you.”\n\n“Nonsense!” scowled Arkwright, again, coloring like a girl. “That is\nonly some of--of Mrs. Henshaw's kind flattery.”\n\nCalderwell jerked the cigar from between his lips, and sat suddenly\nforward in his chair.\n\n“Arkwright, tell me about them. How are they making it go?”\n\nArkwright frowned.\n\n“Who? Make what go?” he asked.\n\n“The Henshaws. Is she happy? Is he--on the square?”\n\nArkwright's face darkened.\n\n“Well, really,” he began; but Calderwell interrupted.\n\n“Oh, come; don't be squeamish. You think I'm butting into what doesn't\nconcern me; but I'm not. What concerns Billy does concern me. And if he\ndoesn't make her happy, I'll--I'll kill him.”\n\nIn spite of himself Arkwright laughed. The vehemence of the other's\nwords, and the fierceness with which he puffed at his cigar as he fell\nback in his chair were most expressive.\n\n“Well, I don't think you need to load revolvers nor sharpen daggers,\njust yet,” he observed grimly.\n\nCalderwell laughed this time, though without much mirth.\n\n“Oh, I'm not in love with Billy, now,” he explained. “Please don't think\nI am. I shouldn't see her if I was, of course.”\n\nArkwright changed his position suddenly, bringing his face into the\nshadow. Calderwell talked on without pausing.\n\n“No, I'm not in love with Billy. But Billy's a trump. You know that.”\n\n“I do.” The words were low, but steadily spoken.\n\n“Of course you do! We all do. And we want her happy. But as for her\nmarrying Bertram--you could have bowled me over with a soap bubble when\nI heard she'd done it. Now understand: Bertram is a good fellow, and I\nlike him. I've known him all his life, and he's all right. Oh, six or\neight years ago, to be sure, he got in with a set of fellows--Bob Seaver\nand his clique--that were no good. Went in for Bohemianism, and all that\nrot. It wasn't good for Bertram. He's got the confounded temperament\nthat goes with his talent, I suppose--though why a man can't paint a\npicture, or sing a song, and keep his temper and a level head I don't\nsee!”\n\n“He can,” cut in Arkwright, with curt emphasis.\n\n“Humph! Well, that's what I think. But, about this marriage business.\nBertram admires a pretty face wherever he sees it--_to paint_, and\nalways has. Not but that he's straight as a string with women--I don't\nmean that; but girls are always just so many pictures to be picked up\non his brushes and transferred to his canvases. And as for his settling\ndown and marrying anybody for keeps, right along--Great Scott! imagine\nBertram Henshaw as a _domestic_ man!”\n\nArkwright stirred restlessly as he spoke up in quick defense:\n\n“Oh, but he is, I assure you. I--I've seen them in their home\ntogether--many times. I think they are--very happy.” Arkwright spoke\nwith decision, though still a little diffidently.\n\nCalderwell was silent. He had picked up the little gilt band he had torn\nfrom his cigar and was fingering it musingly.\n\n“Yes; I've seen them--once,” he said, after a minute. “I took dinner\nwith them when I was on, a month ago.”\n\n“I heard you did.”\n\nAt something in Arkwright's voice, Calderwell turned quickly.\n\n“What do you mean? Why do you say it like that?”\n\nArkwright laughed. The constraint fled from his manner.\n\n“Well, I may as well tell you. You'll hear of it. It's no secret.\nMrs. Henshaw herself tells of it everywhere. It was her friend, Alice\nGreggory, who told me of it first, however. It seems the cook was gone,\nand the mistress had to get the dinner herself.”\n\n“Yes, I know that.”\n\n“But you should hear Mrs. Henshaw tell the story now, or Bertram.\nIt seems she knew nothing whatever about cooking, and her trials and\ntribulations in getting that dinner on to the table were only one\ndegree worse than the dinner itself, according to her story. Didn't\nyou--er--notice anything?”\n\n“Notice anything!” exploded Calderwell. “I noticed that Billy was so\nbrilliant she fairly radiated sparks; and I noticed that Bertram was so\nglum he--he almost radiated thunderclaps. Then I saw that Billy's high\nspirits were all assumed to cover a threatened burst of tears, and I\nlaid it all to him. I thought he'd said something to hurt her; and I\ncould have punched him. Great Scott! Was _that_ what ailed them?”\n\n“I reckon it was. Alice says that since then Mrs. Henshaw has fairly\nhaunted the kitchen, begging Eliza to teach her everything, _every\nsingle thing_ she knows!”\n\nCalderwell chuckled.\n\n“If that isn't just like Billy! She never does anything by halves. By\nGeorge, but she was game over that dinner! I can see it all now.”\n\n“Alice says she's really learning to cook, in spite of old Pete's\nhorror, and Eliza's pleadings not to spoil her pretty hands.”\n\n“Then Pete is back all right? What a faithful old soul he is!”\n\nArkwright frowned slightly.\n\n“Yes, he's faithful, but he isn't all right, by any means. I think he's\na sick man, myself.”\n\n“What makes Billy let him work, then?”\n\n“Let him!” sniffed Arkwright. “I'd like to see you try to stop him! Mrs.\nHenshaw begs and pleads with him to stop, but he scouts the idea. Pete\nis thoroughly and unalterably convinced that the family would starve to\ndeath if it weren't for him; and Mrs. Henshaw says that she'll admit he\nhas some grounds for his opinion when one remembers the condition of the\nkitchen and dining-room the night she presided over them.”\n\n“Poor Billy!” chuckled Calderwell. “I'd have gone down into the kitchen\nmyself if I'd suspected what was going on.”\n\nArkwright raised his eyebrows.\n\n“Perhaps it's well you didn't--if Bertram's picture of what he found\nthere when he went down is a true one. Mrs. Henshaw acknowledges that\neven the cat sought refuge under the stove.”\n\n“As if the veriest worm that crawls ever needed to seek refuge from\nBilly!” scoffed Calderwell. “By the way, what's this Annex I hear of?\nBertram mentioned it, but I couldn't get either of them to tell what\nit was. Billy wouldn't, and Bertram said he couldn't--not with Billy\nshaking her head at him like that. So I had my suspicions. One of\nBilly's pet charities?”\n\n“She doesn't call it that.” Arkwright's face and voice softened. “It is\nHillside. She still keeps it open. She calls it the Annex to her home.\nShe's filled it with a crippled woman, a poor little music teacher, a\nlame boy, and Aunt Hannah.”\n\n“But how--extraordinary!”\n\n“She doesn't think so. She says it's just an overflow house for the\nextra happiness she can't use.”\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Calderwell laid down his cigar, pulled out\nhis handkerchief, and blew his nose furiously. Then he got to his feet\nand walked to the fireplace. After a minute he turned.\n\n“Well, if she isn't the beat 'em!” he spluttered. “And I had the gall to\nask you if Henshaw made her--happy! Overflow house, indeed!”\n\n“The best of it is, the way she does it,” smiled Arkwright. “They're all\nthe sort of people ordinary charity could never reach; and the only way\nshe got them there at all was to make each one think that he or she was\nabsolutely necessary to the rest of them. Even as it is, they all pay a\nlittle something toward the running expenses of the house. They\ninsisted on that, and Mrs. Henshaw had to let them. I believe her chief\ndifficulty now is that she has not less than six people whom she wishes\nto put into the two extra rooms still unoccupied, and she can't make up\nher mind which to take. Her husband says he expects to hear any day of\nan Annexette to the Annex.”\n\n“Humph!” grunted Calderwell, as he turned and began to walk up and down\nthe room. “Bertram is still painting, I suppose.”\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\n“What's he doing now?”\n\n“Several things. He's up to his eyes in work. As you probably have\nheard, he met with a severe accident last summer, and lost the use of\nhis right arm for many months. I believe they thought at one time he had\nlost it forever. But it's all right now, and he has several commissions\nfor portraits. Alice says he's doing ideal heads again, too.”\n\n“Same old 'Face of a Girl'?”\n\n“I suppose so, though Alice didn't say. Of course his special work just\nnow is painting the portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop. You may have\nheard that he tried it last year and--and didn't make quite a success of\nit.”\n\n“Yes. My sister Belle told me. She hears from Billy once in a while.\nWill it be a go, this time?”\n\n“We'll hope so--for everybody's sake. I imagine no one has seen it\nyet--it's not finished; but Alice says--”\n\nCalderwell turned abruptly, a quizzical smile on his face.\n\n“See here, my son,” he interposed, “it strikes me that this Alice is\nsaying a good deal--to you! Who is she?”\n\nArkwright gave a light laugh.\n\n“Why, I told you. She is Miss Alice Greggory, Mrs. Henshaw's friend--and\nmine. I have known her for years.”\n\n“Hm-m; what is she like?”\n\n“Like? Why, she's like--like herself, of course. You'll have to know\nAlice. She's the salt of the earth--Alice is,” smiled Arkwright, rising\nto his feet with a remonstrative gesture, as he saw Calderwell pick up\nhis coat. “What's your hurry?”\n\n“Hm-m,” commented Calderwell again, ignoring the question. “And when,\nmay I ask, do you intend to appropriate this--er--salt--to--er--ah,\nseason your own life with, as I might say--eh?”\n\nArkwright laughed. There was not the slightest trace of embarrassment in\nhis face.\n\n“Never. _You're_ on the wrong track, this time. Alice and I are good\nfriends--always have been, and always will be, I hope.”\n\n“Nothing more?”\n\n“Nothing more. I see her frequently. She is musical, and the Henshaws\nare good enough to ask us there often together. You will meet her,\ndoubtless, now, yourself. She is frequently at the Henshaw home.”\n\n“Hm-m.” Calderwell still eyed his host shrewdly. “Then you'll give me a\nclear field, eh?”\n\n“Certainly.” Arkwright's eyes met his friend's gaze without swerving.\n\n“All right. However, I suppose you'll tell me, as I did you, once, that\na right of way in such a case doesn't mean a thoroughfare for the party\ninterested. If my memory serves me, I gave you right of way in Paris to\nwin the affections of a certain elusive Miss Billy here in Boston, if\nyou could. But I see you didn't seem to improve your opportunities,” he\nfinished teasingly.\n\nArkwright stooped, of a sudden, to pick up a bit of paper from the\nfloor.\n\n“No,” he said quietly. “I didn't seem to improve my opportunities.” This\ntime he did not meet Calderwell's eyes.\n\nThe good-byes had been said when Calderwell turned abruptly at the door.\n\n“Oh, I say, I suppose you're going to that devil's carnival at Jordan\nHall to-morrow night.”\n\n“Devil's carnival! You don't mean--Cyril Henshaw's piano recital!”\n\n“Sure I do,” grinned Calderwell, unabashed. “And I'll warrant it'll be\na devil's carnival, too. Isn't Mr. Cyril Henshaw going to play his own\nmusic? Oh, I know I'm hopeless, from your standpoint, but I can't help\nit. I like mine with some go in it, and a tune that you can find without\nhunting for it. And I don't like lost spirits gone mad that wail and\nshriek through ten perfectly good minutes, and then die with a gasping\nmoan whose home is the tombs. However, you're going, I take it.”\n\n“Of course I am,” laughed the other. “You couldn't hire Alice to miss\none shriek of those spirits. Besides, I rather like them myself, you\nknow.”\n\n“Yes, I suppose you do. You're brought up on it--in your business. But\nme for the 'Merry Widow' and even the hoary 'Jingle Bells' every time!\nHowever, I'm going to be there--out of respect to the poor fellow's\nfamily. And, by the way, that's another thing that bowled me\nover--Cyril's marriage. Why, Cyril hates women!”\n\n“Not all women--we'll hope,” smiled Arkwright. “Do you know his wife?”\n\n“Not much. I used to see her a little at Billy's. Music teacher, wasn't\nshe? Then she's the same sort, I suppose.”\n\n“But she isn't,” laughed Arkwright. “Oh, she taught music, but that\nwas only because of necessity, I take it. She's domestic through and\nthrough, with an overwhelming passion for making puddings and darning\nsocks, I hear. Alice says she believes Mrs. Cyril knows every dish and\nspoon by its Christian name, and that there's never so much as a spool\nof thread out of order in the house.”\n\n“But how does Cyril stand it--the trials and tribulations of domestic\nlife? Bertram used to declare that the whole Strata was aquiver with\nfear when Cyril was composing, and I remember him as a perfect bear if\nanybody so much as whispered when he was in one of his moods. I never\nforgot the night Bertram and I were up in William's room trying to sing\n'When Johnnie comes marching home,' to the accompaniment of a banjo\nin Bertram's hands, and a guitar in mine. Gorry! it was Hugh that went\nmarching home that night.”\n\n“Oh, well, from reports I reckon Mrs. Cyril doesn't play either a banjo\nor a guitar,” smiled Arkwright. “Alice says she wears rubber heels on\nher shoes, and has put hushers on all the chair-legs, and felt-mats\nbetween all the plates and saucers. Anyhow, Cyril is building a new\nhouse, and he looks as if he were in a pretty healthy condition, as\nyou'll see to-morrow night.”\n\n“Humph! I wish he'd make his music healthy, then,” grumbled Calderwell,\nas he opened the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. FOR BILLY--SOME ADVICE\n\n\nFebruary brought busy days. The public opening of the Bohemian Ten Club\nExhibition was to take place the sixth of March, with a private view\nfor invited guests the night before; and it was at this exhibition that\nBertram planned to show his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop. He also, if\npossible, wished to enter two or three other canvases, upon which he was\nspending all the time he could get.\n\nBertram felt that he was doing very good work now. The portrait of\nMarguerite Winthrop was coming on finely. The spoiled idol of society\nhad at last found a pose and a costume that suited her, and she was\ngraciously pleased to give the artist almost as many sittings as he\nwanted. The “elusive something” in her face, which had previously been\nso baffling, was now already caught and held bewitchingly on his canvas.\nHe was confident that the portrait would be a success. He was also much\ninterested in another piece of work which he intended to show called\n“The Rose.” The model for this was a beautiful young girl he had found\nselling flowers with her father in a street booth at the North End.\n\nOn the whole, Bertram was very happy these days. He could not, to\nbe sure, spend quite so much time with Billy as he wished; but she\nunderstood, of course, as did he, that his work must come first. He knew\nthat she tried to show him that she understood it. At the same time, he\ncould not help thinking, occasionally, that Billy did sometimes mind his\nnecessary absorption in his painting.\n\nTo himself Bertram owned that Billy was, in some ways, a puzzle to him.\nHer conduct was still erratic at times. One day he would seem to be\neverything to her; the next--almost nothing, judging by the ease with\nwhich she relinquished his society and substituted that of some one\nelse: Arkwright, or Calderwell, for instance.\n\nAnd that was another thing. Bertram was ashamed to hint even to himself\nthat he was jealous of either of those men. Surely, after what had\nhappened, after Billy's emphatic assertion that she had never loved any\none but himself, it would seem not only absurd, but disloyal, that\nhe should doubt for an instant Billy's entire devotion to him, and\nyet--there were times when he wished he _could_ come home and not\nalways find Alice Greggory, Calderwell, Arkwright, or all three of them\nstrumming the piano in the drawing-room! At such times, always, though,\nif he did feel impatient, he immediately demanded of himself: “Are you,\nthen, the kind of husband that begrudges your wife young companions of\nher own age and tastes to help her while away the hours that you cannot\npossibly spend with her yourself?”\n\nThis question, and the answer that his better self always gave to it,\nwere usually sufficient to send him into some florists for a bunch of\nviolets for Billy, or into a candy shop on a like atoning errand.\n\nAs to Billy--Billy, too, was busy these days chief of her concerns\nbeing, perhaps, attention to that honeymoon of hers, to see that it did\nnot wane. At least, the most of her thoughts, and many of her actions,\ncentered about that object.\n\nBilly had the book, now--the “Talk to Young Wives.” For a time she had\nworked with only the newspaper criticism to guide her; but, coming at\nlast to the conclusion that if a little was good, more must be better,\nshe had shyly gone into a bookstore one day and, with a pink blush, had\nasked for the book. Since bringing it home she had studied assiduously\n(though never if Bertram was near), keeping it well-hidden, when not in\nuse, in a remote corner of her desk.\n\nThere was a good deal in the book that Billy did not like, and there\nwere some statements that worried her; but yet there was much that she\ntried earnestly to follow. She was still striving to be the oak, and\nshe was still eagerly endeavoring to brush up against those necessary\noutside interests. She was so thankful, in this connection, for Alice\nGreggory, and for Arkwright and Hugh Calderwell. It was such a help that\nshe had them! They were not only very pleasant and entertaining outside\ninterests, but one or another of them was almost always conveniently\nwithin reach.\n\nThen, too, it pleased her to think that she was furthering the pretty\nlove story between Alice and Mr. Arkwright. And she _was_ furthering it.\nShe was sure of that. Already she could see how dependent the man was on\nAlice, how he looked to her for approbation, and appealed to her on all\noccasions, exactly as if there was not a move that he wanted to make\nwithout her presence near him. Billy was very sure, now, of Arkwright.\nShe only wished she were as much so of Alice. But Alice troubled her.\nNot but that Alice was kindness itself to the man, either. It was only\na peculiar something almost like fear, or constraint, that Billy thought\nshe saw in Alice's eyes, sometimes, when Arkwright made a particularly\nintimate appeal. There was Calderwell, too. He, also, worried Billy. She\nfeared he was going to complicate matters still more by falling in love\nwith Alice, himself; and this, certainly, Billy did not want at all. As\nthis phase of the matter presented itself, indeed, Billy determined to\nappropriate Calderwell a little more exclusively to herself, when the\nfour were together, thus leaving Alice for Arkwright. After all, it was\nrather entertaining--this playing at Cupid's assistant. If she _could_\nnot have Bertram all the time, it was fortunate that these outside\ninterests were so pleasurable.\n\nMost of the mornings Billy spent in the kitchen, despite the\nremonstrances of both Pete and Eliza. Almost every meal, now, was graced\nwith a palatable cake, pudding, or muffin that Billy would proudly claim\nas her handiwork. Pete still served at table, and made strenuous efforts\nto keep up all his old duties; but he was obviously growing weaker, and\nreally serious blunders were beginning to be noticeable. Bertram even\nhinted once or twice that perhaps it would be just as well to insist on\nhis going; but to this Billy would not give her consent. Even when one\nnight his poor old trembling hands spilled half the contents of a soup\nplate over a new and costly evening gown of Billy's own, she still\nrefused to have him dismissed.\n\n“Why, Bertram, I wouldn't do it,” she declared hotly; “and you wouldn't,\neither. He's been here more than fifty years. It would break his heart.\nHe's really too ill to work, and I wish he would go of his own accord,\nof course; but I sha'n't ever tell him to go--not if he spills soup on\nevery dress I've got. I'll buy more--and more, if it's necessary. Bless\nhis dear old heart! He thinks he's really serving us--and he is, too.”\n\n“Oh, yes, you're right, he _is!_” sighed Bertram, with meaning emphasis,\nas he abandoned the argument.\n\nIn addition to her “Talk to Young Wives,” Billy found herself\nencountering advice and comment on the marriage question from still\nother quarters--from her acquaintances (mostly the feminine ones) right\nand left. Continually she was hearing such words as these:\n\n“Oh, well, what can you expect, Billy? You're an old married woman,\nnow.”\n\n“Never mind, you'll find he's like all the rest of the husbands. You\njust wait and see!”\n\n“Better begin with a high hand, Billy. Don't let him fool you!”\n\n“Mercy! If I had a husband whose business it was to look at women's\nbeautiful eyes, peachy cheeks, and luxurious tresses, I should go\ncrazy! It's hard enough to keep a man's eyes on yourself when his daily\ninterests are supposed to be just lumps of coal and chunks of ice,\nwithout flinging him into the very jaws of temptation like asking him to\npaint a pretty girl's picture!”\n\nIn response to all this, of course, Billy could but laugh, and blush,\nand toss back some gay reply, with a careless unconcern. But in her\nheart she did not like it. Sometimes she told herself that if there were\nnot any advice or comment from anybody--either book or woman--if there\nwere not anybody but just Bertram and herself, life would be just one\nlong honeymoon forever and forever.\n\nOnce or twice Billy was tempted to go to Marie with this honeymoon\nquestion; but Marie was very busy these days, and very preoccupied. The\nnew house that Cyril was building on Corey Hill, not far from the\nAnnex, was almost finished, and Marie was immersed in the subject of\nhouse-furnishings and interior decoration. She was, too, still more\ndeeply engrossed in the fashioning of tiny garments of the softest\nlinen, lace, and woolen; and there was on her face such a look of\nbeatific wonder and joy that Billy did not like to so much as hint that\nthere was in the world such a book as “When the Honeymoon Wanes: A Talk\nto Young Wives.”\n\nBilly tried valiantly these days not to mind that Bertram's work was so\nabsorbing. She tried not to mind that his business dealt, not with lumps\nof coal and chunks of ice, but with beautiful women like Marguerite\nWinthrop who asked him to luncheon, and lovely girls like his model for\n“The Rose” who came freely to his studio and spent hours in the beloved\npresence, being studied for what Bertram declared was absolutely the\nmost wonderful poise of head and shoulders that he had ever seen.\n\nBilly tried, also, these days, to so conduct herself that not by any\nchance could Calderwell suspect that sometimes she was jealous of\nBertram's art. Not for worlds would she have had Calderwell begin to get\nthe notion into his head that his old-time prophecy concerning Bertram's\ncaring only for the turn of a girl's head or the tilt of her chin--to\npaint, was being fulfilled. Hence, particularly gay and cheerful was\nBilly when Calderwell was near. Nor could it be said that Billy was\nreally unhappy at any time. It was only that, on occasion, the very\ndepth of her happiness in Bertram's love frightened her, lest it bring\ndisaster to herself or Bertram.\n\nBilly still went frequently to the Annex. There were yet two unfilled\nrooms in the house. Billy was hesitating which two of six new friends\nof hers to choose as occupants; and it was one day early in March, after\nshe had been talking the matter over with Aunt Hannah, that Aunt Hannah\nsaid:\n\n“Dear me, Billy, if you had your way I believe you'd open another whole\nhouse!”\n\n“Do you know?--that's just what I'm thinking of,” retorted Billy,\ngravely. Then she laughed at Aunt Hannah's shocked gesture of protest.\n“Oh, well, I don't expect to,” she added. “I haven't lived very long,\nbut I've lived long enough to know that you can't always do what you\nwant to.”\n\n“Just as if there were anything _you_ wanted to do that you don't do, my\ndear,” reproved Aunt Hannah, mildly.\n\n“Yes, I know.” Billy drew in her breath with a little catch. “I have so\nmuch that is lovely; and that's why I need this house, you know, for the\noverflow,” she nodded brightly. Then, with a characteristic change of\nsubject, she added: “My, but you should have tasted of the popovers I\nmade for breakfast this morning!”\n\n“I should like to,” smiled Aunt Hannah. “William says you're getting to\nbe quite a cook.”\n\n“Well, maybe,” conceded Billy, doubtfully. “Oh, I can do some things\nall right; but just wait till Pete and Eliza go away again, and Bertram\nbrings home a friend to dinner. That'll tell the tale. I think now I\ncould have something besides potato-mush and burned corn--but maybe I\nwouldn't, when the time came. If only I could buy everything I needed to\ncook with, I'd be all right. But I can't, I find.”\n\n“Can't buy what you need! What do you mean?”\n\nBilly laughed ruefully.\n\n“Well, every other question I ask Eliza, she says: 'Why, I don't know;\nyou have to use your judgment.' Just as if I had any judgment about how\nmuch salt to use, or what dish to take! Dear me, Aunt Hannah, the man\nthat will grow judgment and can it as you would a mess of peas, has got\nhis fortune made!”\n\n“What an absurd child you are, Billy,” laughed Aunt Hannah. “I used to\ntell Marie--By the way, how is Marie? Have you seen her lately?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I saw her yesterday,” twinkled Billy. “She had a book of\nwall-paper samples spread over the back of a chair, two bunches of\nsamples of different colored damasks on the table before her, a 'Young\nMother's Guide' propped open in another chair, and a pair of baby's\nsocks in her lap with a roll each of pink, and white, and blue ribbon.\nShe spent most of the time, after I had helped her choose the ribbon, in\nasking me if I thought she ought to let the baby cry and bother Cyril,\nor stop its crying and hurt the baby, because her 'Mother's Guide' says\na certain amount of crying is needed to develop a baby's lungs.”\n\nAunt Hannah laughed, but she frowned, too.\n\n“The idea! I guess Cyril can stand proper crying--and laughing,\ntoo--from his own child!” she said then, crisply.\n\n“Oh, but Marie is afraid he can't,” smiled Billy. “And that's the\ntrouble. She says that's the only thing that worries her--Cyril.”\n\n“Nonsense!” ejaculated Aunt Hannah.\n\n“Oh, but it isn't nonsense to Marie,” retorted Billy. “You should see\nthe preparations she's made and the precautions she's taken. Actually,\nwhen I saw those baby's socks in her lap, I didn't know but she was\ngoing to put rubber heels on them! They've built the new house with\ndeadening felt in all the walls, and Marie's planned the nursery and\nCyril's den at opposite ends of the house; and she says she shall keep\nthe baby there _all_ the time--the nursery, I mean, not the den. She\nsays she's going to teach it to be a quiet baby and hate noise. She says\nshe thinks she can do it, too.”\n\n“Humph!” sniffed Aunt Hannah, scornfully.\n\n“You should have seen Marie's disgust the other day,” went on Billy, a\nbit mischievously. “Her Cousin Jane sent on a rattle she'd made herself,\nall soft worsted, with bells inside. It was a dear; but Marie was\nhorror-stricken. 'My baby have a rattle?' she cried. 'Why, what would\nCyril say? As if he could stand a rattle in the house!' And if she\ndidn't give that rattle to the janitor's wife that very day, while I was\nthere!”\n\n“Humph!” sniffed Aunt Hannah again, as Billy rose to go. “Well, I'm\nthinking Marie has still some things to learn in this world--and Cyril,\ntoo, for that matter.”\n\n“I wouldn't wonder,” laughed Billy, giving Aunt Hannah a good-by kiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. PETE\n\n\nBertram Henshaw had no disquieting forebodings this time concerning his\nportrait of Marguerite Winthrop when the doors of the Bohemian Ten Club\nExhibition were thrown open to members and invited guests. Just how\ngreat a popular success it was destined to be, he could not know, of\ncourse, though he might have suspected it when he began to receive the\nadmiring and hearty congratulations of his friends and fellow-artists on\nthat first evening.\n\nNor was the Winthrop portrait the only jewel in his crown on that\noccasion. His marvelously exquisite “The Rose,” and his smaller ideal\npicture, “Expectation,” came in for scarcely less commendation. There\nwas no doubt now. The originator of the famous “Face of a Girl” had come\ninto his own again. On all sides this was the verdict, one long-haired\ncritic of international fame even claiming openly that Henshaw had\nnot only equaled his former best work, but had gone beyond it, in both\nartistry and technique.\n\nIt was a brilliant gathering. Society, as usual, in costly evening gowns\nand correct swallow-tails rubbed elbows with names famous in the world\nof Art and Letters. Everywhere were gay laughter and sparkling repartee.\nEven the austere-faced J. G. Winthrop unbent to the extent of grim\nsmiles in response to the laudatory comments bestowed upon the pictured\nimage of his idol, his beautiful daughter.\n\nAs to the great financier's own opinion of the work, no one heard him\nexpress it except, perhaps, the artist; and all that he got was a grip\nof the hand and a “Good! I knew you'd fetch it this time, my boy!” But\nthat was enough. And, indeed, no one who knew the stern old man needed\nto more than look into his face that evening to know of his entire\nsatisfaction in this portrait soon to be the most recent, and the most\ncherished addition to his far-famed art collection.\n\nAs to Bertram--Bertram was pleased and happy and gratified, of course,\nas was natural; but he was not one whit more so than was Bertram's wife.\nBilly fairly radiated happiness and proud joy. She told Bertram, indeed,\nthat if he did anything to make her any prouder, it would take an Annex\nthe size of the Boston Opera House to hold her extra happiness.\n\n“Sh-h, Billy! Some one will hear you,” protested Bertram, tragically;\nbut, in spite of his horrified voice, he did not look displeased.\n\nFor the first time Billy met Marguerite Winthrop that evening. At the\noutset there was just a bit of shyness and constraint in the young\nwife's manner. Billy could not forget her old insane jealousy of this\nbeautiful girl with the envied name of Marguerite. But it was for only a\nmoment, and soon she was her natural, charming self.\n\nMiss Winthrop was fascinated, and she made no pretense of hiding it. She\neven turned to Bertram at last, and cried:\n\n“Surely, now, Mr. Henshaw, you need never go far for a model! Why don't\nyou paint your wife?”\n\nBilly colored. Bertram smiled.\n\n“I have,” he said. “I have painted her many times. In fact, I have\npainted her so often that she once declared it was only the tilt of her\nchin and the turn of her head that I loved--to paint,” he said merrily,\nenjoying Billy's pretty confusion, and not realizing that his words\nreally distressed her. “I have a whole studio full of 'Billys' at home.”\n\n“Oh, have you, really?” questioned Miss Winthrop, eagerly. “Then mayn't\nI see them? Mayn't I, please, Mrs. Henshaw? I'd so love to!”\n\n“Why, of course you may,” murmured both the artist and his wife.\n\n“Thank you. Then I'm coming right away. May I? I'm going to Washington\nnext week, you see. Will you let me come to-morrow at--at half-past\nthree, then? Will it be quite convenient for you, Mrs. Henshaw?”\n\n“Quite convenient. I shall be glad to see you,” smiled Billy. And\nBertram echoed his wife's cordial permission.\n\n“Thank you. Then I'll be there at half-past three,” nodded Miss\nWinthrop, with a smile, as she turned to give place to an admiring\ngroup, who were waiting to pay their respects to the artist and his\nwife.\n\nThere was, after all, that evening, one fly in Billy's ointment.\n\nIt fluttered in at the behest of an old acquaintance--one of the “advice\nwomen,” as Billy termed some of her too interested friends.\n\n“Well, they're lovely, perfectly lovely, of course, Mrs. Henshaw,” said\nthis lady, coming up to say good-night. “But, all the same, I'm\nglad my husband is just a plain lawyer. Look out, my dear, that while\nMr. Henshaw is stealing all those pretty faces for his canvases--just\nlook out that the fair ladies don't turn around and steal his heart\nbefore you know it. Dear me, but you must be so proud of him!”\n\n“I am,” smiled Billy, serenely; and only the jagged split that rent the\nglove on her hand, at that moment, told of the fierce anger behind that\nsmile.\n\n“As if I couldn't trust Bertram!” raged Billy passionately to herself,\nstealing a surreptitious glance at her ruined glove. “And as if there\nweren't ever any perfectly happy marriages--even if you don't ever hear\nof them, or read of them!”\n\nBertram was not home to luncheon on the day following the opening night\nof the Bohemian Ten Club. A matter of business called him away from the\nhouse early in the morning; but he told his wife that he surely would\nbe on hand for Miss Winthrop's call at half-past three o'clock that\nafternoon.\n\n“Yes, do,” Billy had urged. “I think she's lovely, but you know her so\nmuch better than I do that I want you here. Besides, you needn't think\n_I'm_ going to show her all those Billys of yours. I may be vain, but\nI'm not quite vain enough for that, sir!”\n\n“Don't worry,” her husband had laughed. “I'll be here.”\n\nAs it chanced, however, something occurred an hour before half-past\nthree o'clock that drove every thought of Miss Winthrop's call from\nBilly's head.\n\nFor three days, now, Pete had been at the home of his niece in South\nBoston. He had been forced, finally, to give up and go away. News from\nhim the day before had been anything but reassuring, and to-day, Bertram\nbeing gone, Billy had suggested that Eliza serve a simple luncheon and\ngo immediately afterward to South Boston to see how her uncle was. This\nsuggestion Eliza had followed, leaving the house at one o'clock.\n\nShortly after two Calderwell had dropped in to bring Bertram, as he\nexpressed it, a bunch of bouquets he had gathered at the picture show\nthe night before. He was still in the drawing-room, chatting with Billy,\nwhen the telephone bell rang.\n\n“If that's Bertram, tell him to come home; he's got company,” laughed\nCalderwell, as Billy passed into the hall.\n\nA moment later he heard Billy give a startled cry, followed by a few\nbroken words at short intervals. Then, before he could surmise what\nhad happened, she was back in the drawing-room again, her eyes full of\ntears.\n\n“It's Pete,” she choked. “Eliza says he can't live but a few minutes.\nHe wants to see me once more. What shall I do? John's got Peggy out with\nAunt Hannah and Mrs. Greggory. It was so nice to-day I made them go.\nBut I must get there some way--Pete is calling for me. Uncle William is\ngoing, and I told Eliza where she might reach Bertram; but what shall\n_I_ do? How shall I go?”\n\nCalderwell was on his feet at once.\n\n“I'll get a taxi. Don't worry--we'll get there. Poor old soul--of course\nhe wants to see you! Get on your things. I'll have it here in no time,”\n he finished, hurrying to the telephone.\n\n“Oh, Hugh, I'm so glad I've got _you_ here,” sobbed Billy, stumbling\nblindly toward the stairway. “I'll be ready in two minutes.”\n\nAnd she was; but neither then, nor a little later when she and\nCalderwell drove hurriedly away from the house, did Billy once remember\nthat Miss Marguerite Winthrop was coming to call that afternoon to see\nMrs. Bertram Henshaw and a roomful of Billy pictures.\n\nPete was still alive when Calderwell left Billy at the door of the\nmodest little home where Eliza's mother lived.\n\n“Yes, you're in time, ma'am,” sobbed Eliza; “and, oh, I'm so glad you've\ncome. He's been askin' and askin' for ye.”\n\nFrom Eliza Billy learned then that Mr. William was there, but not Mr.\nBertram. They had not been able to reach Mr. Bertram, or Mr. Cyril.\n\nBilly never forgot the look of reverent adoration that came into Pete's\neyes as she entered the room where he lay.\n\n“Miss Billy--my Miss Billy! You were so good-to come,” he whispered\nfaintly.\n\nBilly choked back a sob.\n\n“Of course I'd come, Pete,” she said gently, taking one of the thin,\nworn hands into both her soft ones.\n\nIt was more than a few minutes that Pete lived. Four o'clock came, and\nfive, and he was still with them. Often he opened his eyes and smiled.\nSometimes he spoke a low word to William or Billy, or to one of the\nweeping women at the foot of the bed. That the presence of his beloved\nmaster and mistress meant much to him was plain to be seen.\n\n“I'm so sorry,” he faltered once, “about that pretty dress--I spoiled,\nMiss Billy. But you know--my hands--”\n\n“I know, I know,” soothed Billy; “but don't worry. It wasn't spoiled,\nPete. It's all fixed now.”\n\n“Oh, I'm so glad,” sighed the sick man. After another long interval of\nsilence he turned to William.\n\n“Them socks--the medium thin ones--you'd oughter be puttin' 'em on soon,\nsir, now. They're in the right-hand corner of the bottom drawer--you\nknow.”\n\n“Yes, Pete; I'll attend to it,” William managed to stammer, after he had\ncleared his throat.\n\nEliza's turn came next.\n\n“Remember about the coffee,” Pete said to her, “--the way Mr. William\nlikes it. And always eggs, you know, for--for--” His voice trailed into\nan indistinct murmur, and his eyelids drooped wearily.\n\nOne by one the minutes passed. The doctor came and went: there was\nnothing he could do. At half-past five the thin old face became again\nalight with consciousness. There was a good-by message for Bertram, and\none for Cyril. Aunt Hannah was remembered, and even little Tommy Dunn.\nThen, gradually, a gray shadow crept over the wasted features. The words\ncame more brokenly. The mind, plainly, was wandering, for old Pete was\nyoung again, and around him were the lads he loved, William, Cyril, and\nBertram. And then, very quietly, soon after the clock struck six, Pete\nfell into the beginning of his long sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. WHEN BERTRAM CAME HOME\n\n\nIt was a little after half-past three o'clock that afternoon when\nBertram Henshaw hurried up Beacon Street toward his home. He had been\ndelayed, and he feared that Miss Winthrop would already have reached the\nhouse. Mindful of what Billy had said that morning, he knew how his wife\nwould fret if he were not there when the guest arrived. The sight\nof what he surmised to be Miss Winthrop's limousine before his door\nhastened his steps still more. But as he reached the house, he was\nsurprised to find Miss Winthrop herself turning away from the door.\n\n“Why, Miss Winthrop,” he cried, “you're not going _now!_ You can't have\nbeen here any--yet!”\n\n“Well, no, I--I haven't,” retorted the lady, with heightened color and a\nsomewhat peculiar emphasis. “My ring wasn't answered.”\n\n“Wasn't answered!” Bertram reddened angrily. “Why, what can that mean?\nWhere's the maid? Where's my wife? Mrs. Henshaw must be here! She was\nexpecting you.”\n\nBertram, in his annoyed amazement, spoke loudly, vehemently. Hence he\nwas quite plainly heard by the group of small boys and girls who had\nbeen improving the mild weather for a frolic on the sidewalk, and who\nhad been attracted to his door a moment before by the shining magnet\nof the Winthrop limousine with its resplendently liveried chauffeur. As\nBertram spoke, one of the small girls, Bessie Bailey, stepped forward\nand piped up a shrill reply.\n\n“She ain't, Mr. Henshaw! She ain't here. I saw her go away just a little\nwhile ago.”\n\nBertram turned sharply.\n\n“You saw her go away! What do you mean?”\n\nSmall Bessie swelled with importance. Bessie was thirteen, in spite of\nher diminutive height. Bessie's mother was dead, and Bessie's caretakers\nwere gossiping nurses and servants, who frequently left in her way books\nthat were much too old for Bessie to read--but she read them.\n\n“I mean she ain't here--your wife, Mr. Henshaw. She went away. I saw\nher. I guess likely she's eloped, sir.”\n\n“Eloped!”\n\nBessie swelled still more importantly. To her experienced eyes the\nsituation contained all the necessary elements for the customary flight\nof the heroine in her story-books, as here, now, was the irate, deserted\nhusband.\n\n“Sure! And 'twas just before you came--quite a while before. A big shiny\nblack automobile like this drove up--only it wasn't quite such a nice\none--an' Mrs. Henshaw an' a man came out of your house an' got in, an'\ndrove right away _quick!_ They just ran to get into it, too--didn't\nthey?” She appealed to her young mates grouped about her.\n\nA chorus of shrill exclamations brought Mr. Bertram Henshaw suddenly\nto his senses. By a desperate effort he hid his angry annoyance as\nhe turned to the manifestly embarrassed young woman who was already\ndescending the steps.\n\n“My dear Miss Winthrop,” he apologized contritely, “I'm sure\nyou'll forgive this seeming great rudeness on the part of my wife.\nNotwithstanding the lurid tales of our young friends here, I suspect\nnothing more serious has happened than that my wife has been hastily\nsummoned to Aunt Hannah, perhaps. Or, of course, she may not have\nunderstood that you were coming to-day at half-past three--though I\nthought she did. But I'm so sorry--when you were so kind as to come--”\n Miss Winthrop interrupted with a quick gesture.\n\n“Say no more, I beg of you,” she entreated. “Mrs. Henshaw is quite\nexcusable, I'm sure. Please don't give it another thought,” she\nfinished, as with a hurried direction to the man who was holding open\nthe door of her car, she stepped inside and bowed her good-byes.\n\nBertram, with stern self-control, forced himself to walk nonchalantly\nup his steps, leisurely take out his key, and open his door, under the\ninterested eyes of Bessie Bailey and her friends; but once beyond their\nhateful stare, his demeanor underwent a complete change. Throwing aside\nhis hat and coat, he strode to the telephone.\n\n“Oh, is that you, Aunt Hannah?” he called crisply, a moment later.\n“Well, if Billy's there will you tell her I want to speak to her,\nplease?”\n\n“Billy?” answered Aunt Hannah's slow, gentle tones. “Why, my dear boy,\nBilly isn't here!”\n\n“She isn't? Well, when did she leave? She's been there, hasn't she?”\n\n“Why, I don't think so, but I'll see, if you like. Mrs. Greggory and\nI have just this minute come in from an automobile ride. We would have\nstayed longer, but it began to get chilly, and I forgot to take one of\nthe shawls that I'd laid out.”\n\n“Yes; well, if you will see, please, if Billy has been there, and when\nshe left,” said Bertram, with grim self-control.\n\n“All right. I'll see,” murmured Aunt Hannah. In a few moments her voice\nagain sounded across the wires. “Why, no, Bertram, Rosa says she hasn't\nbeen here since yesterday. Isn't she there somewhere about the house?\nDidn't you know where she was going?”\n\n“Well, no, I didn't--else I shouldn't have been asking you,” snapped\nthe irate Bertram and hung up the receiver with most rude haste, thereby\ncutting off an astounded “Oh, my grief and conscience!” in the middle of\nit.\n\nThe next ten minutes Bertram spent in going through the whole house,\nfrom garret to basement. Needless to say, he found nothing to enlighten\nhim, or to soothe his temper. Four o'clock came, then half-past, and\nfive. At five Bertram began to look for Eliza, but in vain. At half-past\nfive he watched for William; but William, too, did not come.\n\nBertram was pacing the floor now, nervously. He was a little frightened,\nbut more mortified and angry. That Billy should have allowed Miss\nWinthrop to call by appointment only to find no hostess, no message,\nno maid, even, to answer her ring--it was inexcusable! Impulsiveness,\nunconventionality, and girlish irresponsibility were all very\ndelightful, of course--at times; but not now, certainly. Billy was not\na girl any longer. She was a married woman. _Something_ was due to him,\nher husband! A pretty picture he must have made on those steps, trying\nto apologize for a truant wife, and to laugh off that absurd Bessie\nBailey's preposterous assertion at the same time! What would Miss\nWinthrop think? What could she think? Bertram fairly ground his teeth\nwith chagrin, at the situation in which he found himself.\n\nNor were matters helped any by the fact that Bertram was hungry.\nBertram's luncheon had been meager and unsatisfying. That the kitchen\ndown-stairs still remained in silent, spotless order instead of being\nastir with the sounds and smells of a good dinner (as it should have\nbeen) did not improve his temper. Where Billy was he could not imagine.\nHe thought, once or twice, of calling up some of her friends; but\nsomething held him back from that--though he did try to get Marie,\nknowing very well that she was probably over to the new house and would\nnot answer. He was not surprised, therefore, when he received no reply\nto his ring.\n\nThat there was the slightest truth in Bessie Bailey's absurd “elopement”\n idea, Bertram did not, of course, for an instant believe. The only\nthing that rankled about that was the fact that she had suggested such a\nthing, and that Miss Winthrop and those silly children had heard her. He\nrecognized half of Bessie's friends as neighborhood youngsters, and he\nknew very well that there would be many a quiet laugh at his expense\naround various Beacon Street dinner-tables that night. At the thought\nof those dinner-tables, he scowled again. _He_ had no dinner-table--at\nleast, he had no dinner on it!\n\nWho the man might be Bertram thought he could easily guess. It was\neither Arkwright or Calderwell, of course; and probably that tiresome\nAlice Greggory was mixed up in it somehow. He did wish Billy--\n\nSix o'clock came, then half-past. Bertram was indeed frightened now, but\nhe was more angry, and still more hungry. He had, in fact, reached that\nstate of blind unreasonableness said to be peculiar to hungry males from\ntime immemorial.\n\nAt ten minutes of seven a key clicked in the lock of the outer door, and\nWilliam and Billy entered the hall.\n\nIt was almost dark. Bertram could not see their faces. He had not\nlighted the hall at all.\n\n“Well,” he began sharply, “is this the way you receive your callers,\nBilly? I came home and found Miss Winthrop just leaving--no one here\nto receive her! Where've you been? Where's Eliza? Where's my dinner?\nOf course I don't mean to scold, Billy, but there is a limit to even\nmy patience--and it's reached now. I can't help suggesting that if\nyou would tend to your husband and your home a little more, and go\ngallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a\nlittle less, that--Where is Eliza, anyway?” he finished irritably,\nswitching on the lights with a snap.\n\nThere was a moment of dead silence. At Bertram's first words Billy and\nWilliam had stopped short. Neither had moved since. Now William turned\nand began to speak, but Billy interrupted. She met her husband's gaze\nsteadily.\n\n“I will be down at once to get your dinner,” she said quietly. “Eliza\nwill not come to-night. Pete is dead.”\n\nBertram started forward with a quick cry.\n\n“Dead! Oh, Billy! Then you were--_there!_ Billy!”\n\nBut his wife did not apparently hear him. She passed him without turning\nher head, and went on up the stairs, leaving him to meet the sorrowful,\naccusing eyes of William.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. AFTER THE STORM\n\n\nThe young husband's apologies were profuse and abject. Bertram was\nheartily ashamed of himself, and was man enough to acknowledge it.\nAlmost on his knees he begged Billy to forgive him; and in a frenzy\nof self-denunciation he followed her down into the kitchen that night,\npiteously beseeching her to speak to him, to just _look_ at him, even,\nso that he might know he was not utterly despised--though he did,\nindeed, deserve to be more than despised, he moaned.\n\nAt first Billy did not speak, or even vouchsafe a glance in his\ndirection. Very quietly she went about her preparations for a simple\nmeal, paying apparently no more attention to Bertram than as if he were\nnot there. But that her ears were only seemingly, and not really deaf,\nwas shown very clearly a little later, when, at a particularly abject\nwail on the part of the babbling shadow at her heels, Billy choked into\na little gasp, half laughter, half sob. It was all over then. Bertram\nhad her in his arms in a twinkling, while to the floor clattered and\nrolled a knife and a half-peeled baked potato.\n\nNaturally, after that, there could be no more dignified silences on the\npart of the injured wife. There were, instead, half-smiles, tears, sobs,\na tremulous telling of Pete's going and his messages, followed by a\ntearful listening to Bertram's story of the torture he had endured at\nthe hands of Miss Winthrop, Bessie Bailey, and an empty, dinnerless\nhouse. And thus, in one corner of the kitchen, some time later, a\nhungry, desperate William found them, the half-peeled, cold baked potato\nstill at their feet.\n\nTorn between his craving for food and his desire not to interfere with\nany possible peace-making, William was obviously hesitating what to do,\nwhen Billy glanced up and saw him. She saw, too, at the same time, the\nempty, blazing gas-stove burner, and the pile of half-prepared potatoes,\nto warm which the burner had long since been lighted. With a little cry\nshe broke away from her husband's arms.\n\n“Mercy! and here's poor Uncle William, bless his heart, with not a thing\nto eat yet!”\n\nThey all got dinner then, together, with many a sigh and quick-coming\ntear as everywhere they met some sad reminder of the gentle old hands\nthat would never again minister to their comfort.\n\nIt was a silent meal, and little, after all, was eaten, though brave\nattempts at cheerfulness and naturalness were made by all three.\nBertram, especially, talked, and tried to make sure that the shadow on\nBilly's face was at least not the one his own conduct had brought there.\n\n“For you do--you surely do forgive me, don't you?” he begged, as he\nfollowed her into the kitchen after the sorry meal was over.\n\n“Why, yes, dear, yes,” sighed Billy, trying to smile.\n\n“And you'll forget?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Billy! And you'll forget?” Bertram's voice was insistent, reproachful.\n\nBilly changed color and bit her lip. She looked plainly distressed.\n\n“Billy!” cried the man, still more reproachfully.\n\n“But, Bertram, I can't forget--quite yet,” faltered Billy.\n\nBertram frowned. For a minute he looked as if he were about to take\nup the matter seriously and argue it with her; but the next moment he\nsmiled and tossed his head with jaunty playfulness--Bertram, to tell the\ntruth, had now had quite enough of what he privately termed “scenes”\n and “heroics”; and, manlike, he was very ardently longing for the old\neasy-going friendliness, with all unpleasantness banished to oblivion.\n\n“Oh, but you'll have to forget,” he claimed, with cheery insistence,\n“for you've promised to forgive me--and one can't forgive without\nforgetting. So, there!” he finished, with a smilingly determined\n“now-everything-is-just-as-it-was-before” air.\n\nBilly made no response. She turned hurriedly and began to busy herself\nwith the dishes at the sink. In her heart she was wondering: could she\never forget what Bertram had said? Would anything ever blot out those\nawful words: “If you would tend to your husband and your home a little\nmore, and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice\nGreggory a little less--“? It seemed now that always, for evermore, they\nwould ring in her ears; always, for evermore, they would burn deeper and\ndeeper into her soul. And not once, in all Bertram's apologies, had he\nreferred to them--those words he had uttered. He had not said he did not\nmean them. He had not said he was sorry he spoke them. He had ignored\nthem; and he expected that now she, too, would ignore them. As if she\ncould!” If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more,\nand go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory\na little less--” Oh, if only she could, indeed,--forget!\n\nWhen Billy went up-stairs that night she ran across her “Talk to Young\nWives” in her desk. With a half-stifled cry she thrust it far back out\nof sight.\n\n“I hate you, I hate you--with all your old talk about 'brushing up\nagainst outside interests'!” she whispered fiercely. “Well, I've\n'brushed'--and now see what I've got for it!”\n\nLater, however, after Bertram was asleep, Billy crept out of bed and\ngot the book. Under the carefully shaded lamp in the adjoining room she\nturned the pages softly till she came to the sentence: “Perhaps it would\nbe hard to find a more utterly unreasonable, irritable, irresponsible\ncreature than a hungry man.” With a long sigh she began to read; and not\nuntil some minutes later did she close the book, turn off the light, and\nsteal back to bed.\n\nDuring the next three days, until after the funeral at the shabby little\nSouth Boston house, Eliza spent only about half of each day at the\nStrata. This, much to her distress, left many of the household tasks for\nher young mistress to perform. Billy, however, attacked each new duty\nwith a feverish eagerness that seemed to make the performance of it\nvery like some glad penance done for past misdeeds. And when--on the\nday after they had laid the old servant in his last resting place--a\ndespairing message came from Eliza to the effect that now her mother was\nvery ill, and would need her care, Billy promptly told Eliza to stay as\nlong as was necessary; that they could get along all right without her.\n\n“But, Billy, what _are_ we going to do?” Bertram demanded, when he heard\nthe news. “We must have somebody!”\n\n“_I'm_ going to do it.”\n\n“Nonsense! As if you could!” scoffed Bertram.\n\nBilly lifted her chin.\n\n“Couldn't I, indeed,” she retorted. “Do you realize, young man, how\nmuch I've done the last three days? How about those muffins you had this\nmorning for breakfast, and that cake last night? And didn't you yourself\nsay that you never ate a better pudding than that date puff yesterday\nnoon?”\n\nBertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“My dear love, I'm not questioning your _ability_ to do it,” he soothed\nquickly. “Still,” he added, with a whimsical smile, “I must remind you\nthat Eliza has been here half the time, and that muffins and date puffs,\nhowever delicious, aren't all there is to running a big house like this.\nBesides, just be sensible, Billy,” he went on more seriously, as he\nnoted the rebellious gleam coming into his young wife's eyes; “you'd\nknow you couldn't do it, if you'd just stop to think. There's the\nCarletons coming to dinner Monday, and my studio Tea to-morrow, to\nsay nothing of the Symphony and the opera, and the concerts you'd lose\nbecause you were too dead tired to go to them. You know how it was with\nthat concert yesterday afternoon which Alice Greggory wanted you to go\nto with her.”\n\n“I didn't--want--to go,” choked Billy, under her breath.\n\n“And there's your music. You haven't done a thing with that for days,\nyet only last week you told me the publishers were hurrying you for that\nlast song to complete the group.”\n\n“I haven't felt like--writing,” stammered Billy, still half under her\nbreath.\n\n“Of course you haven't,” triumphed Bertram. “You've been too dead tired.\nAnd that's just what I say. Billy, you _can't_ do it all yourself!”\n\n“But I want to. I want to--to tend to things,” faltered Billy, with a\nhalf-fearful glance into her husband's face.\n\nBilly was hearing very loudly now that accusing “If you'd tend to your\nhusband and your home a little more--” Bertram, however, was not hearing\nit, evidently. Indeed, he seemed never to have heard it--much less to\nhave spoken it.\n\n“'Tend to things,'” he laughed lightly. “Well, you'll have enough to do\nto tend to the maid, I fancy. Anyhow, we're going to have one. I'll just\nstep into one of those--what do you call 'em?--intelligence offices on\nmy way down and send one up,” he finished, as he gave his wife a good-by\nkiss.\n\nAn hour later Billy, struggling with the broom and the drawing-room\ncarpet, was called to the telephone. It was her husband's voice that\ncame to her.\n\n“Billy, for heaven's sake, take pity on me. Won't you put on your duds\nand come and engage your maid yourself?”\n\n“Why, Bertram, what's the matter?”\n\n“Matter? Holy smoke! Well, I've been to three of those intelligence\noffices--though why they call them that I can't imagine. If ever\nthere was a place utterly devoid of intelligence-but never mind! I've\ninterviewed four fat ladies, two thin ones, and one medium with a wart.\nI've cheerfully divulged all our family secrets, promised every other\nhalf-hour out, and taken oath that our household numbers three\nadult members, and no more; but I simply _can't_ remember how many\nhandkerchiefs we have in the wash each week. Billy, will you come? Maybe\nyou can do something with them. I'm sure you can!”\n\n“Why, of course I'll come,” chirped Billy. “Where shall I meet you?”\n\nBertram gave the street and number.\n\n“Good! I'll be there,” promised Billy, as she hung up the receiver.\n\nQuite forgetting the broom in the middle of the drawing-room floor,\nBilly tripped up-stairs to change her dress. On her lips was a gay\nlittle song. In her heart was joy.\n\n“I rather guess _now_ I'm tending to my husband and my home!” she was\ncrowing to herself.\n\nJust as Billy was about to leave the house the telephone bell jangled\nagain.\n\nIt was Alice Greggory.\n\n“Billy, dear,” she called, “can't you come out? Mr. Arkwright and Mr.\nCalderwell are here, and they've brought some new music. We want you.\nWill you come?”\n\n“I can't, dear. Bertram wants me. He's sent for me. I've got some\n_housewifely_ duties to perform to-day,” returned Billy, in a voice so\ncuriously triumphant that Alice, at her end of the wires, frowned in\npuzzled wonder as she turned away from the telephone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. INTO TRAINING FOR MARY ELLEN\n\n\nBertram told a friend afterwards that he never knew the meaning of the\nword “chaos” until he had seen the Strata during the weeks immediately\nfollowing the laying away of his old servant.\n\n“Every stratum was aquiver with apprehension,” he declared; “and there\nwas never any telling when the next grand upheaval would rock the whole\nstructure to its foundations.”\n\nNor was Bertram so far from being right. It was, indeed, a chaos, as\nnone knew better than did Bertram's wife.\n\nPoor Billy! Sorry indeed were these days for Billy; and, as if to make\nher cup of woe full to overflowing, there were Sister Kate's epistolary\n“I told you so,” and Aunt Hannah's ever recurring lament: “If only,\nBilly, you were a practical housekeeper yourself, they wouldn't impose\non you so!”\n\nAunt Hannah, to be sure, offered Rosa, and Kate, by letter, offered\nadvice--plenty of it. But Billy, stung beyond all endurance, and fairly\nradiating hurt pride and dogged determination, disdained all assistance,\nand, with head held high, declared she was getting along very well, very\nwell indeed!\n\nAnd this was the way she “got along.”\n\nFirst came Nora. Nora was a blue-eyed, black-haired Irish girl, the\nsixth that the despairing Billy had interviewed on that fateful morning\nwhen Bertram had summoned her to his aid. Nora stayed two days. During\nher reign the entire Strata echoed to banged doors, dropped china, and\nslammed furniture. At her departure the Henshaws' possessions were less\nby four cups, two saucers, one plate, one salad bowl, two cut glass\ntumblers, and a teapot--the latter William's choicest bit of Lowestoft.\n\nOlga came next. Olga was a Treasure. She was low-voiced, gentle-eyed,\nand a good cook. She stayed a week. By that time the growing frequency\nof the disappearance of sundry small articles of value and convenience\nled to Billy's making a reluctant search of Olga's room--and to Olga's\ndeparture; for the room was, indeed, a treasure house, the Treasure\nhaving gathered unto itself other treasures.\n\nFollowing Olga came a period of what Bertram called “one night stands,”\n so frequently were the dramatis personæ below stairs changed.\nGretchen drank. Christine knew only four words of English: salt,\ngood-by, no, and yes; and Billy found need occasionally of using other\nwords. Mary was impertinent and lazy. Jennie could not even boil a\npotato properly, much less cook a dinner. Sarah (colored) was willing\nand pleasant, but insufferably untidy. Bridget was neatness itself, but\nshe had no conception of the value of time. Her meals were always from\nthirty to sixty minutes late, and half-cooked at that. Vera sang--when\nshe wasn't whistling--and as she was generally off the key, and\nalways off the tune, her almost frantic mistress dismissed her before\ntwenty-four hours had passed. Then came Mary Ellen.\n\nMary Ellen began well. She was neat, capable, and obliging; but it\ndid not take her long to discover just how much--and how little--her\nmistress really knew of practical housekeeping. Matters and things were\nvery different then. Mary Ellen became argumentative, impertinent, and\ndomineering. She openly shirked her work, when it pleased her so to do,\nand demanded perquisites and privileges so insolently that even William\nasked Billy one day whether Mary Ellen or Billy herself were the\nmistress of the Strata: and Bertram, with mock humility, inquired how\n_soon_ Mary Ellen would be wanting the house. Billy, in weary despair,\nsubmitted to this bullying for almost a week; then, in a sudden\naccession of outraged dignity that left Mary Ellen gasping with\nsurprise, she told the girl to go.\n\nAnd thus the days passed. The maids came and the maids went, and, to\nBilly, each one seemed a little worse than the one before. Nowhere\nwas there comfort, rest, or peacefulness. The nights were a torture of\napprehension, and the days an even greater torture of fulfilment. Noise,\nconfusion, meals poorly cooked and worse served, dust, disorder, and\nuncertainty. And this was _home_, Billy told herself bitterly. No wonder\nthat Bertram telephoned more and more frequently that he had met a\nfriend, and was dining in town. No wonder that William pushed back\nhis plate almost every meal with his food scarcely touched, and then\nwandered about the house with that hungry, homesick, homeless look that\nnearly broke her heart. No wonder, indeed!\n\nAnd so it had come. It was true. Aunt Hannah and Kate and the “Talk to\nYoung Wives” were right. She had not been fit to marry Bertram. She had\nnot been fit to marry anybody. Her honeymoon was not only waning, but\ngoing into a total eclipse. Had not Bertram already declared that if she\nwould tend to her husband and her home a little more--\n\nBilly clenched her small hands and set her round chin squarely.\n\nVery well, she would show them. She would tend to her husband and her\nhome. She fancied she could _learn_ to run that house, and run it well!\nAnd forthwith she descended to the kitchen and told the then reigning\ntormentor that her wages would be paid until the end of the week, but\nthat her services would be immediately dispensed with.\n\nBilly was well aware now that housekeeping was a matter of more than\nmuffins and date puffs. She could gauge, in a measure, the magnitude of\nthe task to which she had set herself. But she did not falter; and very\nsystematically she set about making her plans.\n\nWith a good stout woman to come in twice a week for the heavier work,\nshe believed she could manage by herself very well until Eliza could\ncome back. At least she could serve more palatable meals than the most\nof those that had appeared lately; and at least she could try to make a\nhome that would not drive Bertram to club dinners, and Uncle William to\nhungry wanderings from room to room. Meanwhile, all the time, she could\nbe learning, and in due course she would reach that shining goal of\nHousekeeping Efficiency, short of which--according to Aunt Hannah and\nthe “Talk to Young Wives”--no woman need hope for a waneless honeymoon.\n\nSo chaotic and erratic had been the household service, and so quietly\ndid Billy slip into her new role, that it was not until the second meal\nafter the maid's departure that the master of the house discovered what\nhad happened. Then, as his wife rose to get some forgotten article, he\nquestioned, with uplifted eyebrows:\n\n“Too good to wait upon us, is my lady now, eh?”\n\n“My lady is waiting on you,” smiled Billy.\n\n“Yes, I see _this_ lady is,” retorted Bertram, grimly; “but I mean our\nreal lady in the kitchen. Great Scott, Billy, how long are you going to\nstand this?”\n\nBilly tossed her head airily, though she shook in her shoes. Billy had\nbeen dreading this moment.\n\n“I'm not standing it. She's gone,” responded Billy, cheerfully, resuming\nher seat. “Uncle William, sha'n't I give you some more pudding?”\n\n“Gone, so soon?” groaned Bertram, as William passed his plate, with a\nsmiling nod. “Oh, well,” went on Bertram, resignedly, “she stayed longer\nthan the last one. When is the next one coming?”\n\n“She's already here.”\n\nBertram frowned.\n\n“Here? But--you served the dessert, and--” At something in Billy's\nface, a quick suspicion came into his own. “Billy, you don't mean that\nyou--_you_--”\n\n“Yes,” she nodded brightly, “that's just what I mean. I'm the next one.”\n\n“Nonsense!” exploded Bertram, wrathfully. “Oh, come, Billy, we've been\nall over this before. You know I can't have it.”\n\n“Yes, you can. You've got to have it,” retorted Billy, still with that\ndisarming, airy cheerfulness. “Besides, 'twon't be half so bad as you\nthink. Wasn't that a good pudding to-night? Didn't you both come back\nfor more? Well, I made it.”\n\n“Puddings!” ejaculated Bertram, with an impatient gesture. “Billy,\nas I've said before, it takes something besides puddings to run this\nhouse.”\n\n“Yes, I know it does,” dimpled Billy, “and I've got Mrs. Durgin for that\npart. She's coming twice a week, and more, if I need her. Why, dearie,\nyou don't know anything about how comfortable you're going to be! I'll\nleave it to Uncle William if--”\n\nBut Uncle William had gone. Silently he had slipped from his chair and\ndisappeared. Uncle William, it might be mentioned in passing, had never\nquite forgotten Aunt Hannah's fateful call with its dire revelations\nconcerning a certain unwanted, superfluous, third-party husband's\nbrother. Remembering this, there were times when he thought absence was\nboth safest and best. This was one of the times.\n\n“But, Billy, dear,” still argued Bertram, irritably, “how can you? You\ndon't know how. You've had no experience.”\n\nBilly threw back her shoulders. An ominous light came to her eyes. She\nwas no longer airily playful.\n\n“That's exactly it, Bertram. I don't know how--but I'm going to learn. I\nhaven't had experience--but I'm going to get it. I _can't_ make a worse\nmess of it than we've had ever since Eliza went, anyway!”\n\n“But if you'd get a maid--a good maid,” persisted Bertram, feebly.\n\n“I had _one_--Mary Ellen. She was a good maid--until she found out how\nlittle her mistress knew; then--well, you know what it was then. Do you\nthink I'd let that thing happen to me again? No, sir! I'm going into\ntraining for--my next Mary Ellen!” And with a very majestic air Billy\nrose from the table and began to clear away the dishes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. THE EFFICIENCY STAR--AND BILLY\n\n\nBilly was not a young woman that did things by halves. Long ago, in\nthe days of her childhood, her Aunt Ella had once said of her: “If only\nBilly didn't go into things all over, so; but whether it's measles or\nmud pies, I always know that she'll be the measliest or the muddiest\nof any child in town!” It could not be expected, therefore, that Billy\nwould begin to play her new rôle now with any lack of enthusiasm. But\neven had she needed any incentive, there was still ever ringing in her\nears Bertram's accusing: “If you'd tend to your husband and your home\na little more--” Billy still declared very emphatically that she\nhad forgiven Bertram; but she knew, in her heart, that she had not\nforgotten.\n\nCertainly, as the days passed, it could not be said that Billy was not\ntending to her husband and her home. From morning till night, now,\nshe tended to nothing else. She seldom touched her piano--save to dust\nit--and she never touched her half-finished song-manuscript, long since\nbanished to the oblivion of the music cabinet. She made no calls except\noccasional flying visits to the Annex, or to the pretty new home\nwhere Marie and Cyril were now delightfully settled. The opera and the\nSymphony were over for the season, but even had they not been, Billy\ncould not have attended them. She had no time. Surely she was not\ndoing any “gallivanting” now, she told herself sometimes, a little\naggrievedly.\n\nThere was, indeed, no time. From morning until night Billy was busy,\nflying from one task to another. Her ambition to have everything just\nright was equalled only by her dogged determination to “just show them”\n that she could do this thing. At first, of course, hampered as she was\nby ignorance and inexperience, each task consumed about twice as much\ntime as was necessary. Yet afterwards, when accustomedness had brought\nits reward of speed, there was still for Billy no time; for increased\nknowledge had only opened the way to other paths, untrodden and\nalluring. Study of cookbooks had led to the study of food values. Billy\ndiscovered suddenly that potatoes, beef, onions, oranges, and puddings\nwere something besides vegetables, meat, fruit, and dessert. They\npossessed attributes known as proteids, fats, and carbohydrates. Faint\nmemories of long forgotten school days hinted that these terms had been\nheard before; but never, Billy was sure, had she fully realized what\nthey meant.\n\nIt was at this juncture that Billy ran across a book entitled “Correct\nEating for Efficiency.” She bought it at once, and carried it home\nin triumph. It proved to be a marvelous book. Billy had not read two\nchapters before she began to wonder how the family had managed to live\nthus far with any sort of success, in the face of their dense ignorance\nand her own criminal carelessness concerning their daily bill of fare.\n\nAt dinner that night Billy told Bertram and William of her discovery,\nand, with growing excitement, dilated on the wonderful good that it was\nto bring to them.\n\n“Why, you don't know, you can't imagine what a treasure it is!” she\nexclaimed. “It gives a complete table for the exact balancing of food.”\n\n“For what?” demanded Bertram, glancing up.\n\n“The exact balancing of food; and this book says that's the biggest\nproblem that modern scientists have to solve.”\n\n“Humph!” shrugged Bertram. “Well, you just balance my food to my hunger,\nand I'll agree not to complain.”\n\n“Oh, but, Bertram, it's serious, really,” urged Billy, looking genuinely\ndistressed. “Why, it says that what you eat goes to make up what you\nare. It makes your vital energies. Your brain power and your body\npower come from what you eat. Don't you see? If you're going to paint\na picture you need something different from what you would if you were\ngoing to--to saw wood; and what this book tells is--is what I ought to\ngive you to make you do each one, I should think, from what I've read\nso far. Now don't you see how important it is? What if I should give you\nthe saw-wood kind of a breakfast when you were just going up-stairs to\npaint all day? And what if I should give Uncle William a--a soldier's\nbreakfast when all he is going to do is to go down on State Street and\nsit still all day?”\n\n“But--but, my dear,” began Uncle William, looking slightly worried,\n“there's my eggs that I _always_ have, you know.”\n\n“For heaven's sake, Billy, what _have_ you got hold of now?” demanded\nBertram, with just a touch of irritation.\n\nBilly laughed merrily.\n\n“Well, I suppose I didn't sound very logical,” she admitted. “But the\nbook--you just wait. It's in the kitchen. I'm going to get it.” And with\nlaughing eagerness she ran from the room.\n\nIn a moment she had returned, book in hand.\n\n“Now listen. _This_ is the real thing--not my garbled inaccuracies. 'The\nfood which we eat serves three purposes: it builds the body substance,\nbone, muscle, etc., it produces heat in the body, and it generates vital\nenergy. Nitrogen in different chemical combinations contributes largely\nto the manufacture of body substances; the fats produce heat; and the\nstarches and sugars go to make the vital energy. The nitrogenous food\nelements we call proteins; the fats and oils, fats; and the starches and\nsugars (because of the predominance of carbon), we call carbohydrates.\nNow in selecting the diet for the day you should take care to choose\nthose foods which give the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in just the\nright proportion.'”\n\n“Oh, Billy!” groaned Bertram.\n\n“But it's so, Bertram,” maintained Billy, anxiously. “And it's every bit\nhere. I don't have to guess at it at all. They even give the quantities\nof calories of energy required for different sized men. I'm going\nto measure you both to-morrow; and you must be weighed, too,” she\ncontinued, ignoring the sniffs of remonstrance from her two listeners.\n“Then I'll know just how many calories to give each of you. They say a\nman of average size and weight, and sedentary occupation, should have\nat least 2,000 calories--and some authorities say 3,000--in this\nproportion: proteins, 300 calories, fats, 350 calories, carbohydrates,\n1,350 calories. But you both are taller than five feet five inches, and\nI should think you weighed more than 145 pounds; so I can't tell just\nyet how many calories you will need.”\n\n“How many we will need, indeed!” ejaculated Bertram.\n\n“But, my dear, you know I have to have my eggs,” began Uncle William\nagain, in a worried voice.\n\n“Of course you do, dear; and you shall have them,” soothed Billy,\nbrightly. “It's only that I'll have to be careful and balance up the\nother things for the day accordingly. Don't you see? Now listen. We'll\nsee what eggs are.” She turned the leaves rapidly. “Here's the food\ntable. It's lovely. It tells everything. I never saw anything so\nwonderful. A--b--c--d--e--here we are. 'Eggs, scrambled or boiled, fats\nand proteins, one egg, 100.' If it's poached it's only 50; but you like\nyours boiled, so we'll have to reckon on the 100. And you always have\ntwo, so that means 200 calories in fats and proteins. Now, don't you\nsee? If you can't have but 300 proteins and 350 fats all day, and you've\nalready eaten 200 in your two eggs, that'll leave just--er--450 for all\nthe rest of the day,--of fats and proteins, you understand. And you've\nno idea how fast that'll count up. Why, just one serving of butter is\n100 of fats, and eight almonds is another, while a serving of lentils is\n100 of proteins. So you see how it'll go.”\n\n“Yes, I see,” murmured Uncle William, casting a mournful glance about\nthe generously laden table, much as if he were bidding farewell to\na departing friend. “But if I should want more to eat--” He stopped\nhelplessly, and Bertram's aggrieved voice filled the pause.\n\n“Look here, Billy, if you think I'm going to be measured for an egg and\nweighed for an almond, you're much mistaken; because I'm not. I want to\neat what I like, and as much as I like, whether it's six calories or six\nthousand!”\n\nBilly chuckled, but she raised her hands in pretended shocked protest.\n\n“Six thousand! Mercy! Bertram, I don't know what would happen if you ate\nthat quantity; but I'm sure you couldn't paint. You'd just have to saw\nwood and dig ditches to use up all that vital energy.”\n\n“Humph!” scoffed Bertram.\n\n“Besides, this is for _efficiency_,” went on Billy, with an earnest\nair. “This man owns up that some may think a 2,000 calory ration is\naltogether too small, and he advises such to begin with 3,000 or\neven 3,500--graded, of course, according to a man's size, weight, and\noccupation. But he says one famous man does splendid work on only\n1,800 calories, and another on even 1,600. But that is just a matter of\nchewing. Why, Bertram, you have no idea what perfectly wonderful things\nchewing does.”\n\n“Yes, I've heard of that,” grunted Bertram; “ten chews to a cherry, and\nsixty to a spoonful of soup. There's an old metronome up-stairs that\nCyril left. You might bring it down and set it going on the table--so\nmany ticks to a mouthful, I suppose. I reckon, with an incentive like\nthat to eat, just about two calories would do me. Eh, William?”\n\n“Bertram! Now you're only making fun,” chided Billy; “and when it's\nreally serious, too. Now listen,” she admonished, picking up the\nbook again. “'If a man consumes a large amount of meat, and very few\nvegetables, his diet will be too rich in protein, and too lacking in\ncarbohydrates. On the other hand, if he consumes great quantities of\npastry, bread, butter, and tea, his meals will furnish too much energy,\nand not enough building material.' There, Bertram, don't you see?”\n\n“Oh, yes, I see,” teased Bertram. “William, better eat what you can\nto-night. I foresee it's the last meal of just _food_ we'll get for some\ntime. Hereafter we'll have proteins, fats, and carbohydrates made into\ncalory croquettes, and--”\n\n“Bertram!” scolded Billy.\n\nBut Bertram would not be silenced.\n\n“Here, just let me take that book,” he insisted, dragging the volume\nfrom Billy's reluctant fingers. “Now, William, listen. Here's your\nbreakfast to-morrow morning: strawberries, 100 calories; whole-wheat\nbread, 75 calories; butter, 100 calories (no second helping, mind you,\nor you'd ruin the balance and something would topple); boiled eggs, 200\ncalories; cocoa, 100 calories--which all comes to 570 calories. Sounds\nlike an English bill of fare with a new kind of foreign money, but\n'tisn't, really, you know. Now for luncheon you can have tomato soup, 50\ncalories; potato salad--that's cheap, only 30 calories, and--” But Billy\npulled the book away then, and in righteous indignation carried it to\nthe kitchen.\n\n“You don't deserve anything to eat,” she declared with dignity, as she\nreturned to the dining-room.\n\n“No?” queried Bertram, his eyebrows uplifted. “Well, as near as I can\nmake out we aren't going to get--much.”\n\nBut Billy did not deign to answer this.\n\nIn spite of Bertram's tormenting gibes, Billy did, for some days,\narrange her meals in accordance with the wonderful table of food given\nin “Correct Eating for Efficiency.” To be sure, Bertram, whatever he\nfound before him during those days, anxiously asked whether he were\neating fats, proteins, or carbohydrates; and he worried openly as to the\npossibility of his meal's producing one calory too much or too little,\nthus endangering his “balance.”\n\nBilly alternately laughed and scolded, to the unvarying good nature of\nher husband. As it happened, however, even this was not for long, for\nBilly ran across a magazine article on food adulteration; and this so\nfilled her with terror lest, in the food served, she were killing her\nfamily by slow poison, that she forgot all about the proteins, fats,\nand carbohydrates. Her talk these days was of formaldehyde, benzoate of\nsoda, and salicylic acid.\n\nVery soon, too, Billy discovered an exclusive Back Bay school for\ninstruction in household economics and domestic hygiene. Billy\ninvestigated it at once, and was immediately aflame with enthusiasm. She\ntold Bertram that it taught everything, _everything_ she wanted to know;\nand forthwith she enrolled herself as one of its most devoted pupils, in\nspite of her husband's protests that she knew enough, more than enough,\nalready. This school attendance, to her consternation, Billy discovered\ntook added time; but in some way she contrived to find it to take.\n\nAnd so the days passed. Eliza's mother, though better, was still too ill\nfor her daughter to leave her. Billy, as the warm weather approached,\nbegan to look pale and thin. Billy, to tell the truth, was working\naltogether too hard; but she would not admit it, even to herself. At\nfirst the novelty of the work, and her determination to conquer at all\ncosts, had given a fictitious strength to her endurance. Now that the\nnovelty had become accustomedness, and the conquering a surety, Billy\ndiscovered that she had a back that could ache, and limbs that, at\ntimes, could almost refuse to move from weariness. There was still,\nhowever, one spur that never failed to urge her to fresh endeavor, and\nto make her, at least temporarily, forget both ache and weariness;\nand that was the comforting thought that now, certainly, even Bertram\nhimself must admit that she was tending to her home and her husband.\n\nAs to Bertram--Bertram, it is true, had at first uttered frequent and\nvehement protests against his wife's absorption of both mind and body\nin “that plaguy housework,” as he termed it. But as the days passed, and\nblessed order superseded chaos, peace followed discord, and delicious,\nwell-served meals took the place of the horrors that had been called\nmeals in the past, he gradually accepted the change with tranquil\nsatisfaction, and forgot to question how it was brought about; though he\ndid still, sometimes, rebel because Billy was always too tired, or too\nbusy, to go out with him. Of late, however, he had not done even this so\nfrequently, for a new “Face of a Girl” had possessed his soul; and all\nhis thoughts and most of his time had gone to putting on canvas the\nvision of loveliness that his mind's eye saw.\n\nBy June fifteenth the picture was finished. Bertram awoke then to his\nsurroundings. He found summer was upon him with no plans made for its\nenjoyment. He found William had started West for a two weeks' business\ntrip. But what he did not find one day--at least at first--was his wife,\nwhen he came home unexpectedly at four o'clock. And Bertram especially\nwanted to find his wife that day, for he had met three people whose\nwords had disquieted him not a little. First, Aunt Hannah. She had said:\n\n“Bertram, where is Billy? She hasn't been out to the Annex for a week;\nand the last time she was there she looked sick. I was real worried\nabout her.”\n\nCyril had been next.\n\n“Where's Billy?” he had asked abruptly. “Marie says she hasn't seen her\nfor two weeks. Marie's afraid she's sick. She says Billy didn't look\nwell a bit, when she did see her.”\n\nCalderwell had capped the climax. He had said:\n\n“Great Scott, Henshaw, where have you been keeping yourself? And where's\nyour wife? Not one of us has caught more than a glimpse of her for\nweeks. She hasn't sung with us, nor played for us, nor let us take her\nanywhere for a month of Sundays. Even Miss Greggory says _she_ hasn't\nseen much of her, and that Billy always says she's too busy to go\nanywhere. But Miss Greggory says she looks pale and thin, and that _she_\nthinks she's worrying too much over running the house. I hope she isn't\nsick!”\n\n“Why, no, Billy isn't sick. Billy's all right,” Bertram had answered. He\nhad spoken lightly, nonchalantly, with an elaborate air of carelessness;\nbut after he had left Calderwell, he had turned his steps abruptly and a\nlittle hastily toward home.\n\nAnd he had not found Billy--at least, not at once. He had gone first\ndown into the kitchen and dining-room. He remembered then, uneasily,\nthat he had always looked for Billy in the kitchen and dining-room, of\nlate. To-day, however, she was not there.\n\nOn the kitchen table Bertram did see a book wide open, and,\nmechanically, he picked it up. It was a much-thumbed cookbook, and it\nwas open where two once-blank pages bore his wife's handwriting. On\nthe first page, under the printed heading “Things to Remember,” he read\nthese sentences:\n\n“That rice swells till every dish in the house is full, and that spinach\nshrinks till you can't find it.\n\n“That beets boil dry if you look out the window.\n\n“That biscuits which look as if they'd been mixed up with a rusty stove\npoker haven't really been so, but have only got too much undissolved\nsoda in them.”\n\nThere were other sentences, but Bertram's eyes chanced to fall on the\nopposite page where the “Things to Remember” had been changed to “Things\nto Forget”; and here Billy had written just four words: “Burns,” “cuts,”\n and “yesterday's failures.”\n\nBertram dropped the book then with a spasmodic clearing of his throat,\nand hurriedly resumed his search. When he did find his wife, at last, he\ngave a cry of dismay--she was on her own bed, huddled in a little heap,\nand shaking with sobs.\n\n“Billy! Why, Billy!” he gasped, striding to the bedside.\n\nBilly sat up at once, and hastily wiped her eyes.\n\n“Oh, is it you, B-Bertram? I didn't hear you come in. You--you s-said\nyou weren't coming till six o'clock!” she choked.\n\n“Billy, what is the meaning of this?”\n\n“N-nothing. I--I guess I'm just tired.”\n\n“What have you been doing?” Bertram spoke sternly, almost sharply. He\nwas wondering why he had not noticed before the little hollows in his\nwife's cheeks. “Billy, what have you been doing?”\n\n“Why, n-nothing extra, only some sweeping, and cleaning out the\nrefrigerator.”\n\n“Sweeping! Cleaning! _You!_ I thought Mrs. Durgin did that.”\n\n“She does. I mean she did. But she couldn't come. She broke her\nleg--fell off the stepladder where she was three days ago. So I _had_\nto do it. And to-day, someway, everything went wrong. I burned me, and I\ncut me, and I used two sodas with not any cream of tartar, and I should\nthink I didn't know anything, not anything!” And down went Billy's head\ninto the pillows again in another burst of sobs.\n\nWith gentle yet uncompromising determination, Bertram gathered his\nwife into his arms and carried her to the big chair. There, for a few\nminutes, he soothed and petted her as if she were a tired child--which,\nindeed, she was.\n\n“Billy, this thing has got to stop,” he said then. There was a very\ninexorable ring of decision in his voice.\n\n“What thing?”\n\n“This housework business.”\n\nBilly sat up with a jerk.\n\n“But, Bertram, it isn't fair. You can't--you mustn't--just because of\nto-day! I _can_ do it. I have done it. I've done it days and days, and\nit's gone beautifully--even if they did say I couldn't!”\n\n“Couldn't what?”\n\n“Be an e-efficient housekeeper.”\n\n“Who said you couldn't?”\n\n“Aunt Hannah and K-Kate.”\n\nBertram said a savage word under his breath.\n\n“Holy smoke, Billy! I didn't marry you for a cook or a scrub-lady. If\nyou _had_ to do it, that would be another matter, of course; and if we\ndid have to do it, we wouldn't have a big house like this for you to do\nit in. But I didn't marry for a cook, and I knew I wasn't getting one\nwhen I married you.”\n\nBilly bridled into instant wrath.\n\n“Well, I like that, Bertram Henshaw! Can't I cook? Haven't I proved that\nI can cook?”\n\nBertram laughed, and kissed the indignant lips till they quivered into\nan unwilling smile.\n\n“Bless your spunky little heart, of course you have! But that doesn't\nmean that I want you to do it. You see, it so happens that you can do\nother things, too; and I'd rather you did those. Billy, you haven't\nplayed to me for a week, nor sung to me for a month. You're too tired\nevery night to talk, or read together, or go anywhere with me. I married\nfor companionship--not cooking and sweeping!”\n\nBilly shook her head stubbornly. Her mouth settled into determined\nlines.\n\n“That's all very well to say. You aren't hungry now, Bertram. But it's\ndifferent when you are, and they said 'twould be.”\n\n“Humph! 'They' are Aunt Hannah and Kate, I suppose.”\n\n“Yes--and the 'Talk to Young Wives.'”\n\n“The w-what?”\n\nBilly choked a little. She had forgotten that Bertram did not know about\nthe “Talk to Young Wives.” She wished that she had not mentioned the\nbook, but now that she had, she would make the best of it. She drew\nherself up with dignity.\n\n“It's a book; a very nice book. It says lots of things--that have come\ntrue.”\n\n“Where is that book? Let me see it, please.”\n\nWith visible reluctance Billy got down from her perch on Bertram's knee,\nwent to her desk and brought back the book.\n\nBertram regarded it frowningly, so frowningly that Billy hastened to its\ndefense.\n\n“And it's true--what it says in there, and what Aunt Hannah and Kate\nsaid. It _is_ different when they're hungry! You said yourself if I'd\ntend to my husband and my home a little more, and--”\n\nBertram looked up with unfeigned amazement.\n\n“I said what?” he demanded.\n\nIn a voice shaken with emotion, Billy repeated the fateful words.\n\n“I never--when did I say that?”\n\n“The night Uncle William and I came home from--Pete's.”\n\nFor a moment Bertram stared dumbly; then a shamed red swept to his\nforehead.\n\n“Billy, _did_ I say that? I ought to be shot if I did. But, Billy, you\nsaid you'd forgiven me!”\n\n“I did, dear--truly I did; but, don't you see?--it was true. I _hadn't_\ntended to things. So I've been doing it since.”\n\nA sudden comprehension illuminated Bertram's face.\n\n“Heavens, Billy! And is that why you haven't been anywhere, or done\nanything? Is that why Calderwell said to-day that you hadn't been with\nthem anywhere, and that--Great Scott, Billy! Did you think I was such a\nselfish brute as that?”\n\n“Oh, but when I was going with them I _was_ following the book--I\nthought,” quavered Billy; and hurriedly she turned the leaves to a\ncarefully marked passage. “It's there--about the outside interests. See?\nI _was_ trying to brush up against them, so that I wouldn't interfere\nwith your Art. Then, when you accused me of gallivanting off with--”\n But Bertram swept her back into his arms, and not for some minutes could\nBilly make a coherent speech again.\n\nThen Bertram spoke.\n\n“See here, Billy,” he exploded, a little shakily, “if I could get you\noff somewhere on a desert island, where there weren't any Aunt Hannahs\nor Kates, or Talks to Young Wives, I think there'd be a chance to make\nyou happy; but--”\n\n“Oh, but there was truth in it,” interrupted Billy, sitting erect again.\n“I _didn't_ know how to run a house, and it was perfectly awful while we\nwere having all those dreadful maids, one after the other; and no woman\nshould be a wife who doesn't know--”\n\n“All right, all right, dear,” interrupted Bertram, in his turn. “We'll\nconcede that point, if you like. But you _do_ know now. You've got the\nefficient housewife racket down pat even to the last calory your husband\nshould be fed; and I'll warrant there isn't a Mary Ellen in Christendom\nwho can find a spot of ignorance on you as big as a pinhead! So we'll\ncall that settled. What you need now is a good rest; and you're going to\nhave it, too. I'm going to have six Mary Ellens here to-morrow morning.\nSix! Do you hear? And all you've got to do is to get your gladdest rags\ntogether for a trip to Europe with me next month. Because we're going.\nI shall get the tickets to-morrow, _after_ I send the six Mary Ellens\npacking up here. Now come, put on your bonnet. We're going down town to\ndinner.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. BILLY TRIES HER HAND AT “MANAGING”\n\n\nBertram did not engage six Mary Ellens the next morning, nor even one,\nas it happened; for that evening, Eliza--who had not been unaware of\nconditions at the Strata--telephoned to say that her mother was so much\nbetter now she believed she could be spared to come to the Strata for\nseveral hours each day, if Mrs. Henshaw would like to have her begin in\nthat way.\n\nBilly agreed promptly, and declared herself as more than willing to put\nup with such an arrangement. Bertram, it is true, when he heard of\nthe plan, rebelled, and asserted that what Billy needed was a rest, an\nentire rest from care and labor. In fact, what he wanted her to do, he\nsaid, was to gallivant--to gallivant all day long.\n\n“Nonsense!” Billy had laughed, coloring to the tips of her ears.\n“Besides, as for the work, Bertram, with just you and me here, and with\nall my vast experience now, and Eliza here for several hours every day,\nit'll be nothing but play for this little time before we go away. You'll\nsee!”\n\n“All right, I'll _see_, then,” Bertram had nodded meaningly. “But just\nmake sure that it _is_ play for you!”\n\n“I will,” laughed Billy; and there the matter had ended.\n\nEliza began work the next day, and Billy did indeed soon find herself\n“playing” under Bertram's watchful insistence. She resumed her music,\nand brought out of exile the unfinished song. With Bertram she took\ndrives and walks; and every two or three days she went to see Aunt\nHannah and Marie. She was pleasantly busy, too, with plans for her\ncoming trip; and it was not long before even the remorseful Bertram had\nto admit that Billy was looking and appearing quite like her old self.\n\nAt the Annex Billy found Calderwell and Arkwright, one day. They greeted\nher as if she had just returned from a far country.\n\n“Well, if you aren't the stranger lady,” began Calderwell, looking\nfrankly pleased to see her. “We'd thought of advertising in the daily\npress somewhat after this fashion: 'Lost, strayed, or stolen, one\nBilly; comrade, good friend, and kind cheerer-up of lonely hearts. Any\ninformation thankfully received by her bereft, sorrowing friends.'”\n\nBilly joined in the laugh that greeted this sally, but Arkwright\nnoticed that she tried to change the subject from her own affairs to\na discussion of the new song on Alice Greggory's piano. Calderwell,\nhowever, was not to be silenced.\n\n“The last I heard of this elusive Billy,” he resumed, with teasing\ncheerfulness, “she was running down a certain lost calory that had\nslipped away from her husband's breakfast, and--”\n\nBilly wheeled sharply.\n\n“Where did you get hold of that?” she demanded.\n\n“Oh, I didn't,” returned the man, defensively. “I never got hold of it\nat all. I never even saw the calory--though, for that matter, I don't\nthink I should know one if I did see it! What we feared was, that, in\nhunting the lost calory, you had lost yourself, and--” But Billy would\nhear no more. With her disdainful nose in the air she walked to the\npiano.\n\n“Come, Mr. Arkwright,” she said with dignity. “Let's try this song.”\n\nArkwright rose at once and accompanied her to the piano.\n\nThey had sung the song through twice when Billy became uneasily aware\nthat, on the other side of the room, Calderwell and Alice Greggory were\nsoftly chuckling over something they had found in a magazine. Billy\nfrowned, and twitched the corners of a pile of music, with restless\nfingers.\n\n“I wonder if Alice hasn't got some quartets here somewhere,” she\nmurmured, her disapproving eyes still bent on the absorbed couple across\nthe room.\n\nArkwright was silent. Billy, throwing a hurried glance into his face,\nthought she detected a somber shadow in his eyes. She thought, too, she\nknew why it was there. So possessed had Billy been, during the early\nwinter, of the idea that her special mission in life was to inaugurate\nand foster a love affair between disappointed Mr. Arkwright and lonely\nAlice Greggory, that now she forgot, for a moment, that Arkwright\nhimself was quite unaware of her efforts. She thought only that the\npresent shadow on his face must be caused by the same thing that brought\nworry to her own heart--the manifest devotion of Calderwell to Alice\nGreggory just now across the room. Instinctively, therefore, as to a\ncoworker in a common cause, she turned a disturbed face to the man at\nher side.\n\n“It is, indeed, high time that I looked after something besides lost\ncalories,” she said significantly. Then, at the evident uncomprehension\nin Arkwright's face, she added: “Has it been going on like this--very\nlong?”\n\nArkwright still, apparently, did not understand.\n\n“Has--what been going on?” he questioned.\n\n“That--over there,” answered Billy, impatiently, scarcely knowing\nwhether to be more irritated at the threatened miscarriage of her\ncherished plans, or at Arkwright's (to her) wilfully blind insistence\non her making her meaning more plain. “Has it been going on long--such\nutter devotion?”\n\nAs she asked the question Billy turned and looked squarely into\nArkwright's face. She saw, therefore, the great change that came to it,\nas her meaning became clear to him. Her first feeling was one of\nshocked realization that Arkwright had, indeed, been really blind. Her\nsecond--she turned away her eyes hurriedly from what she thought she saw\nin the man's countenance.\n\nWith an assumedly gay little cry she sprang to her feet.\n\n“Come, come, what are you two children chuckling over?” she demanded,\ncrossing the room abruptly. “Didn't you hear me say I wanted you to come\nand sing a quartet?”\n\nBilly blamed herself very much for what she called her stupidity in so\nbaldly summoning Arkwright's attention to Calderwell's devotion to Alice\nGreggory. She declared that she ought to have known better, and she\nasked herself if this were the way she was “furthering matters” between\nAlice Greggory and Arkwright.\n\nBilly was really seriously disturbed. She had never quite forgiven\nherself for being so blind to Arkwright's feeling for herself during\nthose days when he had not known of her engagement to Bertram. She had\nnever forgotten, either, the painful scene when he had hopefully told\nof his love, only to be met with her own shocked repudiation. For long\nweeks after that, his face had haunted her. She had wished, oh,\nso ardently, that she could do something in some way to bring him\nhappiness. When, therefore, it had come to her knowledge afterward that\nhe was frequently with his old friend, Alice Greggory, she had been so\nglad. It was very easy then to fan hope into conviction that here, in\nthis old friend, he had found sweet balm for his wounded heart; and she\ndetermined at once to do all that she could do to help. So very glowing,\nindeed, was her eagerness in the matter, that it looked suspiciously as\nif she thought, could she but bring this thing about, that old scores\nagainst herself would be erased.\n\nBilly told herself, virtuously, however, that not only for Arkwright did\nshe desire this marriage to take place, but for Alice Greggory. In the\nvery nature of things Alice would one day be left alone. She was poor,\nand not very strong. She sorely needed the shielding love and care of\na good husband. What more natural than that her old-time friend and\nalmost-sweetheart, M. J. Arkwright, should be that good husband?\n\nThat really it was more Arkwright and less Alice that was being\nconsidered, however, was proved when the devotion of Calderwell began to\nbe first suspected, then known for a fact. Billy's distress at this turn\nof affairs indicated very plainly that it was not just a husband, but a\ncertain one particular husband that she desired for Alice Greggory. All\nthe more disturbed was she, therefore, when to-day, seeing her three\nfriends together again for the first time for some weeks, she discovered\nincreased evidence that her worst fears were to be realized. It was to\nbe Alice and Calderwell, not Alice and Arkwright. Arkwright was again to\nbe disappointed in his dearest hopes.\n\nTelling herself indignantly that it could not be, it _should_ not be,\nBilly determined to remain after the men had gone, and speak to Alice.\nJust what she would say she did not know. Even what she could say, she\nwas not sure. But certainly there must be something, some little thing\nthat she could say, which would open Alice's eyes to what she was doing,\nand what she ought to do.\n\nIt was in this frame of mind, therefore, that Billy, after Arkwright\nand Calderwell had gone, spoke to Alice. She began warily, with assumed\nnonchalance.\n\n“I believe Mr. Arkwright sings better every time I hear him.”\n\nThere was no answer. Alice was sorting music at the piano.\n\n“Don't you think so?” Billy raised her voice a little.\n\nAlice turned almost with a start.\n\n“What's that? Oh, yes. Well, I don't know; maybe I do.”\n\n“You would--if you didn't hear him any oftener than I do,” laughed\nBilly. “But then, of course you do hear him oftener.”\n\n“I? Oh, no, indeed. Not so very much oftener.” Alice had turned back\nto her music. There was a slight embarrassment in her manner. “I\nwonder--where--that new song--is,” she murmured.\n\nBilly, who knew very well where the song lay, was not to be diverted.\n\n“Nonsense! As if Mr. Arkwright wasn't always telling how Alice liked\nthis song, and didn't like that one, and thought the other the best yet!\nI don't believe he sings a thing that he doesn't first sing to you. For\nthat matter, I fancy he asks your opinion of everything, anyway.”\n\n“Why, Billy, he doesn't!” exclaimed Alice, a deep red flaming into her\ncheeks. “You know he doesn't.”\n\nBilly laughed gleefully. She had not been slow to note the color in her\nfriend's face, or to ascribe to it the one meaning she wished to ascribe\nto it. So sure, indeed, was she now that her fears had been groundless,\nthat she flung caution to the winds.\n\n“Ho! My dear Alice, you can't expect us all to be blind,” she teased.\n“Besides, we all think it's such a lovely arrangement that we're just\nglad to see it. He's such a fine fellow, and we like him so much! We\ncouldn't ask for a better husband for you than Mr. Arkwright, and--”\n From sheer amazement at the sudden white horror in Alice Greggory's\nface, Billy stopped short. “Why, Alice!” she faltered then.\n\nWith a visible effort Alice forced her trembling lips to speak.\n\n“My husband--_Mr. Arkwright!_ Why, Billy, you couldn't have seen--you\nhaven't seen--there's nothing you _could_ see! He isn't--he wasn't--he\ncan't be! We--we're nothing but friends, Billy, just good friends!”\n\nBilly, though dismayed, was still not quite convinced.\n\n“Friends! Nonsense! When--”\n\nBut Alice interrupted feverishly. Alice, in an agony of fear lest the\ntrue state of affairs should be suspected, was hiding behind a bulwark\nof pride.\n\n“Now, Billy, please! Say no more. You're quite wrong, entirely. You'll\nnever, never hear of my marrying Mr. Arkwright. As I said before, we're\nfriends--the best of friends; that is all. We couldn't be anything else,\npossibly!”\n\nBilly, plainly discomfited, fell back; but she threw a sharp glance into\nher friend's flushed countenance.\n\n“You mean--because of--Hugh Calderwell?” she demanded. Then, for the\nsecond time that afternoon throwing discretion to the winds, she went on\nplaintively: “You won't listen, of course. Girls in love never do. Hugh\nis all right, and I like him; but there's more real solid worth in Mr.\nArkwright's little finger than there is in Hugh's whole self. And--” But\na merry peal of laughter from Alice Greggory interrupted.\n\n“And, pray, do you think I'm in love with Hugh Calderwell?” she\ndemanded. There was a curious note of something very like relief in her\nvoice.\n\n“Well, I didn't know,” began Billy, uncertainly.\n\n“Then I'll tell you now,” smiled Alice. “I'm not. Furthermore, perhaps\nit's just as well that you should know right now that I don't intend to\nmarry--ever.”\n\n“Oh, Alice!”\n\n“No.” There was determination, and there was still that curious note of\nrelief in the girl's voice. It was as if, somewhere, a great danger had\nbeen avoided. “I have my music. That is enough. I'm not intending to\nmarry.”\n\n“Oh, but Alice, while I will own up I'm glad it isn't Hugh Calderwell,\nthere _is_ Mr. Arkwright, and I did hope--” But Alice shook her head and\nturned resolutely away. At that moment, too, Aunt Hannah came in from\nthe street, so Billy could say no more.\n\nAunt Hannah dropped herself a little wearily into a chair.\n\n“I've just come from Marie's,” she said.\n\n“How is she?” asked Billy.\n\nAunt Hannah smiled, and raised her eyebrows.\n\n“Well, just now she's quite exercised over another rattle--from her\ncousin out West, this time. There were four little silver bells on it,\nand she hasn't got any janitor's wife now to give it to.”\n\nBilly laughed softly, but Aunt Hannah had more to say.\n\n“You know she isn't going to allow any toys but Teddy bears and woolly\nlambs, of which, I believe, she has already bought quite an assortment.\nShe says they don't rattle or squeak. I declare, when I see the woolen\npads and rubber hushers that that child has put everywhere all over the\nhouse, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. And she's so worried! It\nseems Cyril must needs take just this time to start composing a new\nopera or symphony, or something; and never before has she allowed him to\nbe interrupted by anything on such an occasion. But what he'll do when\nthe baby comes she says she doesn't know, for she says she can't--she\njust can't keep it from bothering him some, she's afraid. As if any\nopera or symphony that ever lived was of more consequence than a man's\nown child!” finished Aunt Hannah, with an indignant sniff, as she\nreached for her shawl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK FOR CYRIL\n\n\nIt was early in the forenoon of the first day of July that Eliza told\nher mistress that Mrs. Stetson was asking for her at the telephone.\nEliza's face was not a little troubled.\n\n“I'm afraid, maybe, it isn't good news,” she stammered, as her mistress\nhurriedly arose. “She's at Mr. Cyril Henshaw's--Mrs. Stetson is--and she\nseemed so terribly upset about something that there was no making real\nsense out of what she said. But she asked for you, and said to have you\ncome quick.”\n\nBilly, her own face paling, was already at the telephone.\n\n“Yes, Aunt Hannah. What is it?”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, if you _can_, come up here, please.\nYou must come! _Can't_ you come?”\n\n“Why, yes, of course. But--but--_Marie!_ The--the _baby!_”\n\nA faint groan came across the wires.\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy! It isn't _the_ baby. It's _babies!_\nIt's twins--boys. Cyril has them now--the nurse hasn't got here yet.”\n\n“Twins! _Cyril_ has them!” broke in Billy, hysterically.\n\n“Yes, and they're crying something terrible. We've sent for a second\nnurse to come, too, of course, but she hasn't got here yet, either. And\nthose babies--if you could hear them! That's what we want you for, to--”\n\nBut Billy was almost laughing now.\n\n“All right, I'll come out--and hear them,” she called a bit wildly, as\nshe hung up the receiver.\n\nSome little time later, a palpably nervous maid admitted Billy to the\nhome of Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Henshaw. Even as the door was opened, Billy\nheard faintly, but unmistakably, the moaning wails of two infants.\n\n“Mrs. Stetson says if you will please to help Mr. Henshaw with the\nbabies,” stammered the maid, after the preliminary questions and\nanswers. “I've been in when I could, and they're all right, only\nthey're crying. They're in his den. We had to put them as far away as\npossible--their crying worried Mrs. Henshaw so.”\n\n“Yes, I see,” murmured Billy. “I'll go to them at once. No, don't\ntrouble to come. I know the way. Just tell Mrs. Stetson I'm here,\nplease,” she finished, as she tossed her hat and gloves on to the hall\ntable, and turned to go upstairs.\n\nBilly's feet made no sound on the soft rugs. The crying, however, grew\nlouder and louder as she approached the den. Softly she turned the knob\nand pushed open the door. She stopped short, then, at what she saw.\n\nCyril had not heard her, nor seen her. His back was partly toward the\ndoor. His coat was off, and his hair stood fiercely on end as if a\nnervous hand had ruffled it. His usually pale face was very red, and\nhis forehead showed great drops of perspiration. He was on his feet,\nhovering over the couch, at each end of which lay a rumpled roll of\nlinen, lace, and flannel, from which emerged a prodigiously puckered\nlittle face, two uncertainly waving rose-leaf fists, and a wail of\nprotesting rage that was not uncertain in the least.\n\nIn one hand Cyril held a Teddy bear, in the other his watch, dangling\nfrom its fob chain. Both of these he shook feebly, one after the other,\nabove the tiny faces.\n\n“Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,” he begged\nagitatedly.\n\nIn the doorway Billy clapped her hands to her lips and stifled a laugh.\nBilly knew, of course, that what she should do was to go forward at\nonce, and help this poor, distracted man; but Billy, just then, was not\ndoing what she knew she ought to do.\n\nWith a muttered ejaculation (which Billy, to her sorrow, could not\ncatch) Cyril laid down the watch and flung the Teddy bear aside. Then,\nin very evident despair, he gingerly picked up one of the rumpled rolls\nof flannel, lace, and linen, and held it straight out before him. After\na moment's indecision he began awkwardly to jounce it, teeter it, rock\nit back and forth, and to pat it jerkily.\n\n“Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,” he begged again,\nfrantically.\n\nPerhaps it was the change of position; perhaps it was the novelty of the\nmotion, perhaps it was only utter weariness, or lack of breath. Whatever\nthe cause, the wailing sobs from the bundle in his arms dwindled\nsuddenly to a gentle whisper, then ceased altogether.\n\nWith a ray of hope illuminating his drawn countenance, Cyril carefully\nlaid the baby down and picked up the other. Almost confidently now he\nbegan the jouncing and teetering and rocking as before.\n\n“There, there! Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush,” he\nchanted again.\n\nThis time he was not so successful. Perhaps he had lost his skill.\nPerhaps it was merely the world-old difference in babies. At all events,\nthis infant did not care for jerks and jounces, and showed it plainly by\nemitting loud and yet louder wails of rage--wails in which his brother\non the couch speedily joined.\n\n“Oh, come, come, pretty baby, good baby, hush, hush--_confound it_,\nHUSH, I say!” exploded the frightened, weary, baffled, distracted man,\npicking up the other baby, and trying to hold both his sons at once.\n\nBilly hurried forward then, tearfully, remorsefully, her face all\nsympathy, her arms all tenderness.\n\n“Here, Cyril, let me help you,” she cried.\n\nCyril turned abruptly.\n\n“Thank God, _some_ one's come,” he groaned, holding out both the babies,\nwith an exuberance of generosity. “Billy, you've saved my life!”\n\nBilly laughed tremulously.\n\n“Yes, I've come, Cyril, and I'll help every bit I can; but I don't know\na thing--not a single thing about them myself. Dear me, aren't they\ncunning? But, Cyril, do they always cry so?”\n\nThe father-of-an-hour drew himself stiffly erect.\n\n“Cry? What do you mean? Why shouldn't they cry?” he demanded\nindignantly. “I want you to understand that Doctor Brown said those were\nA number I fine boys! Anyhow, I guess there's no doubt they've got\nlungs all right,” he added, with a grim smile, as he pulled out his\nhandkerchief and drew it across his perspiring brow.\n\nBilly did not have an opportunity to show Cyril how much or how little\nshe knew about babies, for in another minute the maid had appeared with\nthe extra nurse; and that young woman, with trained celerity and easy\nconfidence, assumed instant command, and speedily had peace and order\nrestored.\n\nCyril, freed from responsibility, cast longing eyes, for a moment, upon\nhis work; but the next minute, with a despairing glance about him, he\nturned and fled precipitately.\n\nBilly, following the direction of his eyes, suppressed a smile. On the\ntop of Cyril's manuscript music on the table lay a hot-water bottle.\nDraped over the back of his favorite chair was a pink-bordered baby\nblanket. On the piano-stool rested a beribboned and beruffled baby's\ntoilet basket. From behind the sofa pillow leered ridiculously the Teddy\nbear, just as it had left Cyril's desperate hand.\n\nNo wonder, indeed, that Billy smiled. Billy was thinking of what Marie\nhad said not a week before:\n\n“I shall keep the baby, of course, in the nursery. I've been in homes\nwhere they've had baby things strewn from one end of the house to\nthe other; but it won't be that way here. In the first place, I don't\nbelieve in it; but, even if I did, I'd have to be careful on account\nof Cyril. Imagine Cyril's trying to write his music with a baby in\nthe room! No! I shall keep the baby in the nursery, if possible; but\nwherever it is, it won't be anywhere near Cyril's den, anyway.”\n\nBilly suppressed many a smile during the days that immediately followed\nthe coming of the twins. Some of the smiles, however, refused to be\nsuppressed. They became, indeed, shamelessly audible chuckles.\n\nBilly was to sail the tenth, and, naturally, during those early July\ndays, her time was pretty much occupied with her preparations for\ndeparture; but nothing could keep her from frequent, though short,\nvisits to the home of her brother-in-law.\n\nThe twins were proving themselves to be fine, healthy boys. Two trained\nmaids, and two trained nurses ruled the household with a rod of iron. As\nto Cyril--Billy declared that Cyril was learning something every day of\nhis life now.\n\n“Oh, yes, he's learning things,” she said to Aunt Hannah, one morning;\n“lots of things. For instance: he has his breakfast now, not when he\nwants it, but when the maid wants to give it to him--which is precisely\nat eight o'clock every morning. So he's learning punctuality. And for\nthe first time in his life he has discovered the astounding fact that\nthere are several things more important in the world than is the special\npiece of music he happens to be composing--chiefly the twins' bath, the\ntwins' nap, the twins' airing, and the twins' colic.”\n\nAunt Hannah laughed, though she frowned, too.\n\n“But, surely, Billy, with two nurses and the maids, Cyril doesn't have\nto--to--” She came to a helpless pause.\n\n“Oh, no,” laughed Billy; “Cyril doesn't have to really attend to any of\nthose things--though I have seen each of the nurses, at different times,\nunhesitatingly thrust a twin into his arms and bid him hold the child\ntill she comes back. But it's this way. You see, Marie must be kept\nquiet, and the nursery is very near her room. It worries her terribly\nwhen either of the children cries. Besides, the little rascals have\napparently fixed up some sort of labor-union compact with each other, so\nthat if one cries for something or nothing, the other promptly joins in\nand helps. So the nurses have got into the habit of picking up the first\ndisturber of the peace, and hurrying him to quarters remote; and Cyril's\nden being the most remote of all, they usually fetch up there.”\n\n“You mean--they take those babies into Cyril's den--_now_?” Even Aunt\nHannah was plainly aghast.\n\n“Yes,” twinkled Billy. “I fancy their Hygienic Immaculacies approved\nof Cyril's bare floors, undraped windows, and generally knick-knackless\ncondition. Anyhow, they've made his den a sort of--of annex to the\nnursery.”\n\n“But--but Cyril! What does he say?” stammered the dumfounded Aunt\nHannah. “Think of Cyril's standing a thing like that! Doesn't he do\nanything--or say anything?”\n\nBilly smiled, and lifted her brows quizzically.\n\n“My dear Aunt Hannah, did you ever know _many_ people to have the\ncourage to 'say things' to one of those becapped, beaproned, bespotless\ncreatures of loftily superb superiority known as trained nurses?\nBesides, you wouldn't recognize Cyril now. Nobody would. He's as meek\nas Moses, and has been ever since his two young sons were laid in his\nreluctant, trembling arms. He breaks into a cold sweat at nothing, and\nmoves about his own home as if he were a stranger and an interloper,\nendured merely on sufferance in this abode of strange women and strange\nbabies.”\n\n“Nonsense!” scoffed Aunt Hannah.\n\n“But it's so,” maintained Billy, merrily. “Now, for instance. You know\nCyril always has been in the habit of venting his moods on the piano\n(just as I do, only more so) by playing exactly as he feels. Well, as\nnear as I can gather, he was at his usual trick the next day after the\ntwins arrived; and you can imagine about what sort of music it would be,\nafter what he had been through the preceding forty-eight hours.\n\n“Of course I don't know exactly what happened, but Julia--Marie's second\nmaid, you know--tells the story. She's been with them long enough to\nknow something of the way the whole household always turns on the pivot\nof the master's whims; so she fully appreciated the situation. She\nsays she heard him begin to play, and that she never heard such queer,\ncreepy, shivery music in her life; but that he hadn't been playing five\nminutes before one of the nurses came into the living-room where Julia\nwas dusting, and told her to tell whoever was playing to stop that\ndreadful noise, as they wanted to take the twins in there for their nap.\n\n“'But I didn't do it, ma'am,' Julia says. 'I wa'n't lookin' for losin'\nmy place, an' I let the young woman do the job herself. An' she done\nit, pert as you please. An' jest as I was seekin' a hidin'-place for the\nexplosion, if Mr. Henshaw didn't come out lookin' a little wild, but as\nmeek as a lamb; an' when he sees me he asked wouldn't I please get him a\ncup of coffee, good an' strong. An' I got it.'\n\n“So you see,” finished Billy, “Cyril is learning things--lots of\nthings.”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience! I should say he was,” half-shivered Aunt\nHannah. “_Cyril_ looking meek as a lamb, indeed!”\n\nBilly laughed merrily.\n\n“Well, it must be a new experience--for Cyril. For a man whose daily\nexistence for years has been rubber-heeled and woolen-padded, and whose\nfamily from boyhood has stood at attention and saluted if he so much as\nlooked at them, it must be quite a change, as things are now. However,\nit'll be different, of course, when Marie is on her feet again.”\n\n“Does she know at all how things are going?”\n\n“Not very much, as yet, though I believe she has begun to worry some.\nShe confided to me one day that she was glad, of course, that she had\ntwo darling babies, instead of one; but that she was afraid it might be\nhard, just at first, to teach them both at once to be quiet; for she was\nafraid that while she was teaching one, the other would be sure to cry,\nor do something noisy.”\n\n“Do something noisy, indeed!” ejaculated Aunt Hannah.\n\n“As for the real state of affairs, Marie doesn't dream that Cyril's\nsacred den is given over to Teddy bears and baby blankets. All is, I\nhope she'll be measurably strong before she does find it out,” laughed\nBilly, as she rose to go.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. ARKWRIGHT'S EYES ARE OPENED\n\n\nWilliam came back from his business trip the eighth of July, and on the\nninth Billy and Bertram went to New York. Eliza's mother was so well\nnow that Eliza had taken up her old quarters in the Strata, and the\nhousehold affairs were once more running like clockwork. Later in the\nseason William would go away for a month's fishing trip, and the house\nwould be closed.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bertram Henshaw were not expected to return until the first\nof October; but with Eliza to look after the comfort of William, the\nmistress of the house did no worrying. Ever since Pete's going, Eliza\nhad said that she preferred to be the only maid, with a charwoman to\ncome in for the heavier work; and to this arrangement her mistress had\nwillingly consented, for the present.\n\nMarie and the babies were doing finely, and Aunt Hannah's health, and\naffairs at the Annex, were all that could be desired. As Billy, indeed,\nsaw it, there was only one flaw to mar her perfect content on this\nholiday trip with Bertram, and that was her disappointment over the very\nevident disaster that had come to her cherished matrimonial plans for\nArkwright and Alice Greggory. She could not forget Arkwright's face\nthat day at the Annex, when she had so foolishly called his attention\nto Calderwell's devotion; and she could not forget, either, Alice\nGreggory's very obvious perturbation a little later, and her\nsuspiciously emphatic assertion that she had no intention of marrying\nany one, certainly not Arkwright. As Billy thought of all this now, she\ncould not but admit that it did look dark for Arkwright--poor Arkwright,\nwhom she, more than any one else in the world, perhaps, had a special\nreason for wishing to see happily married.\n\nThere was, then, this one cloud on Billy's horizon as the big boat that\nwas to bear her across the water steamed down the harbor that beautiful\nJuly day.\n\nAs it chanced, naturally, perhaps, not only was Billy thinking of\nArkwright that morning, but Arkwright was thinking of Billy.\n\nArkwright had thought frequently of Billy during the last few days,\nparticularly since that afternoon meeting at the Annex when the four had\nrenewed their old good times together. Up to that day Arkwright had been\ntrying not to think of Billy. He had been “fighting his tiger skin.”\n Sternly he had been forcing himself to meet her, to see her, to talk\nwith her, to sing with her, or to pass her by--all with the indifference\nproperly expected to be shown in association with Mrs. Bertram Henshaw,\nanother man's wife. He had known, of course, that deep down in his\nheart he loved her, always had loved her, and always would love her.\nHopelessly and drearily he accepted this as a fact even while with all\nhis might fighting that tiger skin. So sure was he, indeed, of this, so\nimplicitly had he accepted it as an unalterable certainty, that in time\neven his efforts to fight it became almost mechanical and unconscious in\ntheir stern round of forced indifference.\n\nThen came that day at the Annex--and the discovery: the discovery which\nhe had made when Billy called his attention to Calderwell and Alice\nGreggory across the room in the corner; the discovery which had come\nwith so blinding a force, and which even now he was tempted to question\nas to its reality; the discovery that not Billy Neilson, nor Mrs.\nBertram Henshaw, nor even the tender ghost of a lost love held the\ncenter of his heart--but Alice Greggory.\n\nThe first intimation of all this had come with his curious feeling of\nunreasoning hatred and blind indignation toward Calderwell as,\nthrough Billy's eyes, he had seen the two together. Then had come\nthe overwhelming longing to pick up Alice Greggory and run off with\nher--somewhere, anywhere, so that Calderwell could not follow.\n\nAt once, however, he had pulled himself up short with the mental cry of\n“Absurd!” What was it to him if Calderwell did care for Alice Greggory?\nSurely he himself was not in love with the girl. He was in love with\nBilly; that is--\n\nIt was all confusion then, in his mind, and he was glad indeed when he\ncould leave the house. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to think. He\nmust, in some way, thrash out this astounding thing that had come to\nhim.\n\nArkwright did not visit the Annex again for some days. Until he was more\nnearly sure of himself and of his feelings, he did not wish to see Alice\nGreggory. It was then that he began to think of Billy, deliberately,\npurposefully, for it must be, of course, that he had made a mistake,\nhe told himself. It must be that he did, really, still care for\nBilly--though of course he ought not to.\n\nArkwright made another discovery then. He learned that, however\ndeliberately he started in to think of Billy, he ended every time in\nthinking of Alice. He thought of how good she had been to him, and of\nhow faithful she had been in helping him to fight his love for Billy.\nJust here he decided, for a moment, that probably, after all, his\nfeeling of anger against Calderwell was merely the fear of losing this\nhelpful comradeship that he so needed. Even with himself, however,\nArkwright could not keep up this farce long, and very soon he admitted\nmiserably that it was not the comradeship of Alice Greggory that he\nwanted or needed, but the love.\n\nHe knew it now. No longer was there any use in beating about the bush.\nHe did love Alice Greggory; but so curiously and unbelievably stupid had\nhe been that he had not found it out until now. And now it was too late.\nHad not even Billy called his attention to the fact of Calderwell's\ndevotion? Besides, had not he himself, at the very first, told\nCalderwell that he might have a clear field?\n\nFool that he had been to let another thus lightly step in and win from\nunder his very nose what might have been his if he had but known his own\nmind before it was too late!\n\nBut was it, after all, quite too late? He and Alice were old friends.\nAway back in their young days in their native town they had been,\nindeed, almost sweethearts, in a boy-and-girl fashion. It would not have\ntaken much in those days, he believed, to have made the relationship\nmore interesting. But changes had come. Alice had left town, and for\nyears they had drifted apart. Then had come Billy, and Billy had found\nAlice, thus bringing about the odd circumstance of their renewing of\nacquaintanceship. Perhaps, at that time, if he had not already\nthought he cared for Billy, there would have been something more than\nacquaintanceship.\n\nBut he _had_ thought he cared for Billy all these years; and now, at\nthis late day, to wake up and find that he cared for Alice! A pretty\nmess he had made of things! Was he so inconstant then, so fickle? Did he\nnot know his own mind five minutes at a time? What would Alice Greggory\nthink, even if he found the courage to tell her? What could she think?\nWhat could anybody think?\n\nArkwright fairly ground his teeth in impotent wrath--and he did not know\nwhether he were the most angry that he did not love Billy, or that he\nhad loved Billy, or that he loved somebody else now.\n\nIt was while he was in this unenviable frame of mind that he went to\nsee Alice. Not that he had planned definitely to speak to her of his\ndiscovery, nor yet that he had planned not to. He had, indeed, planned\nnothing. For a man usually so decided as to purpose and energetic as\nto action, he was in a most unhappy state of uncertainty and\nchangeableness. One thing only was unmistakably clear to him, and that\nwas that he must see Alice.\n\nFor months, now, he had taken to Alice all his hopes and griefs,\nperplexities and problems; and never had he failed to find comfort\nin the shape of sympathetic understanding and wise counsel. To Alice,\ntherefore, now he turned as a matter of course, telling himself vaguely\nthat, perhaps, after he had seen Alice, he would feel better.\n\nJust how intimately this particular problem of his concerned Alice\nherself, he did not stop to realize. He did not, indeed, think of it at\nall from Alice's standpoint--until he came face to face with the girl in\nthe living-room at the Annex. Then, suddenly, he did. His manner became\nat once, consequently, full of embarrassment and quite devoid of its\nusual frank friendliness.\n\nAs it happened, this was perhaps the most unfortunate thing that could\nhave occurred, so far as it concerned the attitude of Alice Greggory,\nfor thereby innumerable tiny sparks of suspicion that had been\ntormenting the girl for days were instantly fanned into consuming flames\nof conviction.\n\nAlice had not been slow to note Arkwright's prolonged absence from the\nAnnex. Coming as it did so soon after her most disconcerting talk with\nBilly in regard to her own relations with him, it had filled her with\nfrightened questionings.\n\nIf Billy had seen things to make her think of linking their names\ntogether, perhaps Arkwright himself had heard some such idea put forth\nsomewhere, and that was why he was staying away--to show the world that\nthere was no foundation for such rumors. Perhaps he was even doing it to\nshow _her_ that--\n\nEven in her thoughts Alice could scarcely bring herself to finish the\nsentence. That Arkwright should ever suspect for a moment that she cared\nfor him was intolerable. Painfully conscious as she was that she did\ncare for him, it was easy to fear that others must be conscious of it,\ntoo. Had she not already proof that Billy suspected it? Why, then, might\nnot it be quite possible, even probable, that Arkwright suspected it,\nalso; and, because he did suspect it, had decided that it would be just\nas well, perhaps, if he did not call so often.\n\nIn spite of Alice's angry insistence to herself that, after all, this\ncould not be the case--that the man _knew_ she understood he still loved\nBilly--she could not help fearing, in the face of Arkwright's unusual\nabsence, that it might yet be true. When, therefore, he finally did\nappear, only to become at once obviously embarrassed in her presence,\nher fears instantly became convictions. It was true, then. The man did\nbelieve she cared for him, and he had been trying to teach her--to save\nher.\n\nTo teach her! To save her, indeed! Very well, he should see! And\nforthwith, from that moment, Alice Greggory's chief reason for living\nbecame to prove to Mr. M. J. Arkwright that he needed not to teach her,\nto save her, nor yet to sympathize with her.\n\n“How do you do?” she greeted him, with a particularly bright smile. “I'm\nsure I _hope_ you are well, such a beautiful day as this.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I'm well, I suppose. Still, I have felt better in my life,”\n smiled Arkwright, with some constraint.\n\n“Oh, I'm sorry,” murmured the girl, striving so hard to speak with\nimpersonal unconcern that she did not notice the inaptness of her reply.\n\n“Eh? Sorry I've felt better, are you?” retorted Arkwright, with nervous\nhumor. Then, because he was embarrassed, he said the one thing he had\nmeant not to say: “Don't you think I'm quite a stranger? It's been some\ntime since I've been here.”\n\nAlice, smarting under the sting of what she judged to be the only\npossible cause for his embarrassment, leaped to this new opportunity to\nshow her lack of interest.\n\n“Oh, has it?” she murmured carelessly. “Well, I don't know but it has,\nnow that I come to think of it.”\n\nArkwright frowned gloomily. A week ago he would have tossed back a\nlaughingly aggrieved remark as to her unflattering indifference to his\npresence. Now he was in no mood for such joking. It was too serious a\nmatter with him.\n\n“You've been busy, no doubt, with--other matters,” he presumed\nforlornly, thinking of Calderwell.\n\n“Yes, I have been busy,” assented the girl. “One is always happier,\nI think, to be busy. Not that I meant that I needed the work to _be_\nhappy,” she added hastily, in a panic lest he think she had a consuming\nsorrow to kill.\n\n“No, of course not,” he murmured abstractedly, rising to his feet and\ncrossing the room to the piano. Then, with an elaborate air of trying to\nappear very natural, he asked jovially: “Anything new to play to me?”\n\nAlice arose at once.\n\n“Yes. I have a little nocturne that I was playing to Mr. Calderwell last\nnight.”\n\n“Oh, to Calderwell!” Arkwright had stiffened perceptibly.\n\n“Yes. _He_ didn't like it. I'll play it to you and see what you say,”\n she smiled, seating herself at the piano.\n\n“Well, if he had liked it, it's safe to say I shouldn't,” shrugged\nArkwright.\n\n“Nonsense!” laughed the girl, beginning to appear more like her natural\nself. “I should think you were Mr. Cyril Henshaw! Mr. Calderwell _is_\npartial to ragtime, I'll admit. But there are some good things he\nlikes.”\n\n“There are, indeed, _some_ good things he likes,” returned Arkwright,\nwith grim emphasis, his somber eyes fixed on what he believed to be the\none especial object of Calderwell's affections at the moment.\n\nAlice, unaware both of the melancholy gaze bent upon herself and of the\ncause thereof, laughed again merrily.\n\n“Poor Mr. Calderwell,” she cried, as she let her fingers slide into\nsoft, introductory chords. “He isn't to blame for not liking what he\ncalls our lost spirits that wail. It's just the way he's made.”\n\nArkwright vouchsafed no reply. With an abrupt gesture he turned and\nbegan to pace the room moodily. At the piano Alice slipped from the\nchords into the nocturne. She played it straight through, then, with a\ncharm and skill that brought Arkwright's feet to a pause before it was\nhalf finished.\n\n“By George, that's great!” he breathed, when the last tone had quivered\ninto silence.\n\n“Yes, isn't it--beautiful?” she murmured.\n\nThe room was very quiet, and in semi-darkness. The last rays of a late\nJune sunset had been filling the room with golden light, but it was gone\nnow. Even at the piano by the window, Alice had barely been able to see\nclearly enough to read the notes of her nocturne.\n\nTo Arkwright the air still trembled with the exquisite melody that had\nbut just left her fingers. A quick fire came to his eyes. He forgot\neverything but that it was Alice there in the half-light by the\nwindow--Alice, whom he loved. With a low cry he took a swift step toward\nher.\n\n“Alice!”\n\nInstantly the girl was on her feet. But it was not toward him that she\nturned. It was away--resolutely, and with a haste that was strangely\nlike terror.\n\nAlice, too, had forgotten, for just a moment. She had let herself drift\ninto a dream world where there was nothing but the music she was playing\nand the man she loved. Then the music had stopped, and the man had\nspoken her name.\n\nAlice remembered then. She remembered Billy, whom this man loved. She\nremembered the long days just passed when this man had stayed away,\npresumably to teach _her_--to save _her_. And now, at the sound of his\nvoice speaking her name, she had almost bared her heart to him.\n\nNo wonder that Alice, with a haste that looked like terror, crossed the\nfloor and flooded the room with light.\n\n“Dear me!” she shivered, carefully avoiding Arkwright's eyes. “If Mr.\nCalderwell were here now he'd have some excuse to talk about our lost\nspirits that wail. That _is_ a creepy piece of music when you play it\nin the dark!” And, for fear that he should suspect how her heart was\naching, she gave a particularly brilliant and joyous smile.\n\nOnce again at the mention of Calderwell's name Arkwright stiffened\nperceptibly. The fire left his eyes. For a moment he did not speak;\nthen, gravely, he said:\n\n“Calderwell? Yes, perhaps he would; and--you ought to be a judge, I\nshould think. You see him quite frequently, don't you?”\n\n“Why, yes, of course. He often comes out here, you know.”\n\n“Yes; I had heard that he did--since _you_ came.”\n\nHis meaning was unmistakable. Alice looked up quickly. A prompt denial\nof his implication was on her lips when the thought came to her that\nperhaps just here lay a sure way to prove to this man before her that\nthere was, indeed, no need for him to teach her, to save her, or yet to\nsympathize with her. She could not affirm, of course; but she need not\ndeny--yet.\n\n“Nonsense!” she laughed lightly, pleased that she could feel what she\nhoped would pass for a telltale color burning her cheeks. “Come, let\nus try some duets,” she proposed, leading the way to the piano. And\nArkwright, interpreting the apparently embarrassed change of subject\nexactly as she had hoped that he would interpret it, followed her, sick\nat heart.\n\n“'O wert thou in the cauld blast,'” sang Arkwright's lips a few moments\nlater.\n\n“I can't tell her now--when I _know_ she cares for Calderwell,” gloomily\nran his thoughts, the while. “It would do no possible good, and would\nonly make her unhappy to grieve me.”\n\n“'O wert thou in the cauld blast,'” chimed in Alice's alto, low and\nsweet.\n\n“I reckon now he won't be staying away from here any more just to _save_\nme!” ran Alice's thoughts, palpitatingly triumphant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. BILLY TAKES HER TURN AT QUESTIONING\n\n\nArkwright did not call to see Alice Greggory for some days. He did not\nwant to see Alice now. He told himself wearily that she could not help\nhim fight this tiger skin that lay across his path, The very fact of her\npresence by his side would, indeed, incapacitate himself for fighting.\nSo he deliberately stayed away from the Annex until the day before he\nsailed for Germany. Then he went out to say good-by.\n\nChagrined as he was at what he termed his imbecile stupidity in not\nknowing his own heart all these past months, and convinced, as he also\nwas, that Alice and Calderwell cared for each other, he could see no way\nfor him but to play the part of a man of kindliness and honor, leaving a\nclear field for his preferred rival, and bringing no shadow of regret to\nmar the happiness of the girl he loved.\n\nAs for being his old easy, frank self on this last call, however, that\nwas impossible; so Alice found plenty of fuel for her still burning\nfires of suspicion--fires which had, indeed, blazed up anew at this\nsecond long period of absence on the part of Arkwright. Naturally,\ntherefore, the call was anything but a joy and comfort to either one.\nArkwright was nervous, gloomy, and abnormally gay by turns. Alice was\nnervous and abnormally gay all the time. Then they said good-by and\nArkwright went away. He sailed the next day, and Alice settled down to\nthe summer of study and hard work she had laid out for herself.\n\n\nOn the tenth of September Billy came home. She was brown, plump-cheeked,\nand smiling. She declared that she had had a perfectly beautiful time,\nand that there couldn't be anything in the world nicer than the trip\nshe and Bertram had taken--just they two together. In answer to Aunt\nHannah's solicitous inquiries, she asserted that she was all well and\nrested now. But there was a vaguely troubled questioning in her eyes\nthat Aunt Hannah did not quite like. Aunt Hannah, however, said nothing\neven to Billy herself about this.\n\nOne of the first friends Billy saw after her return was Hugh Calderwell.\nAs it happened Bertram was out when he came, so Billy had the first\nhalf-hour of the call to herself. She was not sorry for this, as it\ngave her a chance to question Calderwell a little concerning Alice\nGreggory--something she had long ago determined to do at the first\nopportunity.\n\n“Now tell me everything--everything about everybody,” she began\ndiplomatically, settling herself comfortably for a good visit.\n\n“Thank you, I'm well, and have had a passably agreeable summer,\nbarring the heat, sundry persistent mosquitoes, several grievous\ndisappointments, and a felon on my thumb,” he began, with shameless\nimperturbability. “I have been to Revere once, to the circus once,\nto Nantasket three times, and to Keith's and the 'movies' ten times,\nperhaps--to be accurate. I have also--But perhaps there was some one\nelse you desired to inquire for,” he broke off, turning upon his hostess\na bland but unsmiling countenance.\n\n“Oh, no, how could there be?” twinkled Billy. “Really, Hugh, I always\nknew you had a pretty good opinion of yourself, but I didn't credit you\nwith thinking you were _everybody_. Go on. I'm so interested!”\n\nHugh chuckled softly; but there was a plaintive tone in his voice as he\nanswered.\n\n“Thanks, no. I've rather lost my interest now. Lack of appreciation\nalways did discourage me. We'll talk of something else, please. You\nenjoyed your trip?”\n\n“Very much. It just couldn't have been nicer!”\n\n“You were lucky. The heat here has been something fierce!”\n\n“What made you stay?”\n\n“Reasons too numerous, and one too heart-breaking, to mention. Besides,\nyou forget,” with dignity. “There is my profession. I have joined the\nworkers of the world now, you know.”\n\n“Oh, fudge, Hugh!” laughed Billy. “You know very well you're as likely\nas not to start for the ends of the earth to-morrow morning!”\n\nHugh drew himself up.\n\n“I don't seem to succeed in making people understand that I'm serious,”\n he began aggrievedly. “I--” With an expressive flourish of his hands he\nrelaxed suddenly, and fell back in his chair. A slow smile came to\nhis lips. “Well, Billy, I'll give up. You've hit it,” he confessed. “I\n_have_ thought seriously of starting to-morrow morning for _half-way_ to\nthe ends of the earth--Panama.”\n\n“Hugh!”\n\n“Well, I have. Even this call was to be a good-by--if I went.”\n\n“Oh, Hugh! But I really thought--in spite of my teasing--that you had\nsettled down, this time.”\n\n“Yes, so did I,” sighed the man, a little soberly. “But I guess it's\nno use, Billy. Oh, I'm coming back, of course, and link arms again with\ntheir worthy Highnesses, John Doe and Richard Roe; but just now I've got\na restless fit on me. I want to see the wheels go 'round. Of course, if\nI had my bread and butter and cigars to earn, 'twould be different. But\nI haven't, and I know I haven't; and I suspect that's where the trouble\nlies. If it wasn't for those natal silver spoons of mine that Bertram\nis always talking about, things might be different. But the spoons are\nthere, and always have been; and I know they're all ready to dish out\nmountains to climb and lakes to paddle in, any time I've a mind to say\nthe word. So--I just say the word. That's all.”\n\n“And you've said it now?”\n\n“Yes, I think so; for a while.”\n\n“And--those reasons that _have_ kept you here all summer,” ventured\nBilly, “they aren't in--er--commission any longer?”\n\n“No.”\n\nBilly hesitated, regarding her companion meditatively. Then, with the\nfeeling that she had followed a blind alley to its termination, she\nretreated and made a fresh start.\n\n“Well, you haven't yet told me everything about everybody, you know,”\n she hinted smilingly. “You might begin that--I mean the less important\neverybodies, of course, now that I've heard about you.”\n\n“Meaning--”\n\n“Oh, Aunt Hannah, and the Greggorys, and Cyril and Marie, and the twins,\nand Mr. Arkwright, and all the rest.”\n\n“But you've had letters, surely.”\n\n“Yes, I've had letters from some of them, and I've seen most of them\nsince I came back. It's just that I wanted to know _your_ viewpoint of\nwhat's happened through the summer.”\n\n“Very well. Aunt Hannah is as dear as ever, wears just as many shawls,\nand still keeps her clock striking twelve when it's half-past eleven.\nMrs. Greggory is just as sweet as ever--and a little more frail, I\nfear,--bless her heart! Mr. Arkwright is still abroad, as I presume\nyou know. I hear he is doing great stunts over there, and will sing in\nBerlin and Paris this winter. I'm thinking of going across from Panama\nlater. If I do I shall look him up. Mr. and Mrs. Cyril are as well as\ncould be expected when you realize that they haven't yet settled on a\npair of names for the twins.”\n\n“I know it--and the poor little things three months old, too! I think\nit's a shame. You've heard the reason, I suppose. Cyril declares that\nnaming babies is one of the most serious and delicate operations in the\nworld, and that, for his part, he thinks people ought to select their\nown names when they've arrived at years of discretion. He wants to\nwait till the twins are eighteen, and then make each of them a birthday\npresent of the name of their own choosing.”\n\n“Well, if that isn't the limit!” laughed Calderwell. “I'd heard some\nsuch thing before, but I hadn't supposed it was really so.”\n\n“Well, it is. He says he knows more tomboys and enormous fat women named\n'Grace' and 'Lily,' and sweet little mouse-like ladies staggering along\nunder a sonorous 'Jerusha Theodosia' or 'Zenobia Jane'; and that if he\nshould name the boys 'Franz' and 'Felix' after Schubert and Mendelssohn\nas Marie wants to, they'd as likely as not turn out to be men who hated\nthe sound of music and doted on stocks and dry goods.”\n\n“Humph!” grunted Calderwell. “I saw Cyril last week, and he said he\nhadn't named the twins yet, but he didn't tell me why. I offered him two\nperfectly good names myself, but he didn't seem interested.”\n\n“What were they?”\n\n“Eldad and Bildad.”\n\n“Hugh!” protested Billy.\n\n“Well, why not?” bridled the man. “I'm sure those are new and unique,\nand really musical, too--'way ahead of your Franz and Felix.”\n\n“But those aren't really names!”\n\n“Indeed they are.”\n\n“Where did you get them?”\n\n“Off our family tree, though they're Bible names, Belle says. Perhaps\nyou didn't know, but Sister Belle has been making the dirt fly quite\nlively of late around that family tree of ours, and she wrote me some\nof her discoveries. It seems two of the roots, or branches--say, are\nancestors roots, or branches?--were called Eldad and Bildad. Now I\nthought those names were good enough to pass along, but, as I said\nbefore, Cyril wasn't interested.”\n\n“I should say not,” laughed Billy. “But, honestly, Hugh, it's really\nserious. Marie wants them named _something_, but she doesn't say much\nto Cyril. Marie wouldn't really breathe, you know, if she thought Cyril\ndisapproved of breathing. And in this case Cyril does not hesitate to\ndeclare that the boys shall name themselves.”\n\n“What a situation!” laughed Calderwell.\n\n“Isn't it? But, do you know, I can sympathize with it, in a way, for\nI've always mourned so over _my_ name. 'Billy' was always such a trial\nto me! Poor Uncle William wasn't the only one that prepared guns and\nfishing rods to entertain the expected boy. I don't know, though, I'm\nafraid if I'd been allowed to select my name I should have been a 'Helen\nClarabella' all my days, for that was the name I gave all my dolls, with\n'first,' 'second,' 'third,' and so on, added to them for distinction.\nEvidently I thought that 'Helen Clarabella' was the most feminine\nappellation possible, and the most foreign to the despised 'Billy.' So\nyou see I can sympathize with Cyril to a certain extent.”\n\n“But they must call the little chaps _something_, now,” argued Hugh.\n\nBilly gave a sudden merry laugh.\n\n“They do,” she gurgled, “and that's the funniest part of it. Oh, Cyril\ndoesn't. He always calls them impersonally 'they' or 'it.' He doesn't\nsee much of them anyway, now, I understand. Marie was horrified when she\nrealized how the nurses had been using his den as a nursery annex and\nshe changed all that instanter, when she took charge of things again.\nThe twins stay in the nursery now, I'm told. But about the names--the\nnurses, it seems, have got into the way of calling them 'Dot' and\n'Dimple.' One has a dimple in his cheek, and the other is a little\nsmaller of the two. Marie is no end distressed, particularly as she\nfinds that she herself calls them that; and she says the idea of boys\nbeing 'Dot' and 'Dimple'!”\n\n“I should say so,” laughed Calderwell. “Not I regard that as worse than\nmy 'Eldad' and 'Bildad.'”\n\n“I know it, and Alice says--By the way, you haven't mentioned Alice, but\nI suppose you see her occasionally.”\n\nBilly paused in evident expectation of a reply. Billy was, in fact,\nquite pluming herself on the adroit casualness with which she had\nintroduced the subject nearest her heart.\n\nCalderwell raised his eyebrows.\n\n“Oh, yes, I see her.”\n\n“But you hadn't mentioned her.”\n\nThere was the briefest of pauses; then with a half-quizzical dejection,\nthere came the remark:\n\n“You seem to forget. I told you that I stayed here this summer for\nreasons too numerous, and one too heart-breaking, to mention. She was\nthe _one_.”\n\n“You mean--”\n\n“Yes. The usual thing. She turned me down. Oh, I haven't asked her yet\nas many times as I did you, but--”\n\n“_Hugh!_”\n\nHugh tossed her a grim smile and went on imperturbably.\n\n“I'm older now, of course, and know more, perhaps. Besides, the finality\nof her remarks was not to be mistaken.”\n\nBilly, in spite of her sympathy for Calderwell, was conscious of a throb\nof relief that at least one stumbling-block was removed from Arkwright's\npossible pathway to Alice's heart.\n\n“Did she give any special reason?” hazarded Billy, a shade too\nanxiously.\n\n“Oh, yes. She said she wasn't going to marry anybody--only her music.”\n\n“Nonsense!” ejaculated Billy, falling back in her chair a little.\n\n“Yes, I said that, too,” gloomed the man; “but it didn't do any good.\nYou see, I had known another girl who'd said the same thing once.” (He\ndid not look up, but a vivid red flamed suddenly into Billy's cheeks.)\n“And she--when the right one came--forgot all about the music, and\nmarried the man. So I naturally suspected that Alice would do the same\nthing. In fact, I said so to her. I was bold enough to even call the man\nby name--I hadn't been jealous of Arkwright for nothing, you see--but\nshe denied it, and flew into such an indignant allegation that there\nwasn't a word of truth in it, that I had to sue for pardon before I got\nanything like peace.”\n\n“Oh-h!” said Billy, in a disappointed voice, falling quite back in her\nchair this time.\n\n“And so that's why I'm wanting especially just now to see the wheels go\n'round,” smiled Calderwell, a little wistfully. “Oh, I shall get over\nit, I suppose. It isn't the first time, I'll own--but some day I take it\nthere will be a last time. Enough of this, however! You haven't told me\na thing about yourself. How about it? When I come back, are you going\nto give me a dinner cooked by your own fair hands? Going to still play\nBridget?”\n\nBilly laughed and shook her head.\n\n“No; far from it. Eliza has come back, and her cousin from Vermont is\ncoming as second girl to help her. But I _could_ cook a dinner for you\nif I had to now, sir, and it wouldn't be potato-mush and cold lamb,” she\nbragged shamelessly, as there sounded Bertram's peculiar ring, and the\nclick of his key in the lock.\n\n\nIt was the next afternoon that Billy called on Marie. From Marie's,\nBilly went to the Annex, which was very near Cyril's new house; and\nthere, in Aunt Hannah's room, she had what she told Bertram afterwards\nwas a perfectly lovely visit.\n\nAunt Hannah, too, enjoyed the visit very much, though yet there was one\nthing that disturbed her--the vaguely troubled look in Billy's eyes,\nwhich to-day was more apparent than ever. Not until just before Billy\nwent home did something occur to give Aunt Hannah a possible clue as to\nwhat was the meaning of it. That something was a question from Billy.\n\n“Aunt Hannah, why don't I feel like Marie did? why don't I feel like\neverybody does in books and stories? Marie went around with such a\ndetached, heavenly, absorbed look in her eyes, before the twins came to\nher home. But I don't. I don't find anything like that in my face,\nwhen I look in the glass. And I don't feel detached and absorbed and\nheavenly. I'm happy, of course; but I can't help thinking of the dear,\ndear times Bertram and I have together, just we two, and I can't seem to\nimagine it at all with a third person around.”\n\n“Billy! _Third person_, indeed!”\n\n“There! I knew 'twould shock you,” mourned Billy. “It shocks me. I _want_\nto feel detached and heavenly and absorbed.”\n\n“But Billy, dear, think of it--calling your own baby a third person!”\n\nBilly sighed despairingly.\n\n“Yes, I know. And I suppose I might as well own up to the rest of it\ntoo. I--I'm actually afraid of babies, Aunt Hannah! Well, I am,” she\nreiterated, in answer to Aunt Hannah's gasp of disapproval. “I'm not\nused to them at all. I never had any little brothers and sisters, and I\ndon't know how to treat babies. I--I'm always afraid they'll break, or\nsomething. I'm just as afraid of the twins as I can be. How Marie can\nhandle them, and toss them about as she does, I don't see.”\n\n“Toss them about, indeed!”\n\n“Well, it looks that way to me,” sighed Billy. “Anyhow, I know I can\nnever get to handle them like that--and that's no way to feel! And\nI'm ashamed of myself because I _can't_ be detached and heavenly and\nabsorbed,” she added, rising to go. “Everybody always is, it seems, but\njust me.”\n\n“Fiddlededee, my dear!” scoffed Aunt Hannah, patting Billy's downcast\nface. “Wait till a year from now, and we'll see about that third-person\nbugaboo you're worrying about. _I'm_ not worrying now; so you'd better\nnot!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. A DOT AND A DIMPLE\n\n\nOn the day Cyril Henshaw's twins were six months old, a momentous\noccurrence marked the date with a flaming red letter of remembrance; and\nit all began with a baby's smile.\n\nCyril, in quest of his wife at about ten o'clock that morning, and not\nfinding her, pursued his search even to the nursery--a room he very\nseldom entered. Cyril did not like to go into the nursery. He felt ill\nat ease, and as if he were away from home--and Cyril was known to abhor\nbeing away from home since he was married. Now that Marie had taken over\nthe reins of government again, he had been obliged to see very little\nof those strange women and babies. Not but that he liked the babies, of\ncourse. They were his sons, and he was proud of them. They should have\nevery advantage that college, special training, and travel could give\nthem. He quite anticipated what they would be to him--when they really\nknew anything. But, of course, _now_, when they could do nothing but\ncry and wave their absurd little fists, and wobble their heads in so\nfearsome a manner, as if they simply did not know the meaning of the\nword backbone--and, for that matter, of course they didn't--why, he\ncould not be expected to be anything but relieved when he had his den to\nhimself again, with a reasonable chance of finding his manuscript as\nhe had left it, and not cut up into a ridiculous string of paper dolls\nholding hands, as he had once found it, after a visit from a woman with\na small girl.\n\nSince Marie had been at the helm, however, he had not been troubled in\nsuch a way. He had, indeed, known almost his old customary peace and\nfreedom from interruption, with only an occasional flitting across his\npath of the strange women and babies--though he had realized, of course,\nthat they were in the house, especially in the nursery. For that reason,\ntherefore, he always avoided the nursery when possible. But to-day he\nwanted his wife, and his wife was not to be found anywhere else in the\nhouse. So, reluctantly, he turned his steps toward the nursery, and,\nwith a frown, knocked and pushed open the door.\n\n“Is Mrs. Henshaw here?” he demanded, not over gently.\n\nAbsolute silence greeted his question. The man saw then that there was\nno one in the room save a baby sitting on a mat in the middle of the\nfloor, barricaded on all sides with pillows.\n\nWith a deeper frown the man turned to go, when a gleeful “Ah--goo!”\n halted his steps midway. He wheeled sharply.\n\n“Er--eh?” he queried, uncertainly eyeing his small son on the floor.\n\n“Ah--goo!” observed the infant (who had been very lonesome), with\ngreater emphasis; and this time he sent into his father's eyes the most\nbewitching of smiles.\n\n“Well, by George!” murmured the man, weakly, a dawning amazement driving\nthe frown from his face.\n\n“Spgggh--oo--wah!” gurgled the boy, holding out two tiny fists.\n\nA slow smile came to the man's face.\n\n“Well, I'll--be--darned,” he muttered half-shamefacedly, wholly\ndelightedly. “If the rascal doesn't act as if he--knew me!”\n\n“Ah--goo--spggghh!” grinned the infant, toothlessly, but entrancingly.\n\nWith almost a stealthy touch Cyril closed the door back of him, and\nadvanced a little dubiously toward his son. His countenance carried a\nmixture of guilt, curiosity, and dogged determination so ludicrous that\nit was a pity none but baby eyes could see it. As if to meet more\nnearly on a level this baffling new acquaintance, Cyril got to his\nknees--somewhat stiffly, it must be confessed--and faced his son.\n\n“Goo--eee--ooo--yah!” crowed the baby now, thrashing legs and arms about\nin a transport of joy at the acquisition of this new playmate.\n\n“Well, well, young man, you--you don't say so!” stammered the\ngrowingly-proud father, thrusting a plainly timid and unaccustomed\nfinger toward his offspring. “So you do know me, eh? Well, who am I?”\n\n“Da--da!” gurgled the boy, triumphantly clutching the outstretched\nfinger, and holding on with a tenacity that brought a gleeful chuckle to\nthe lips of the man.\n\n“Jove! but aren't you the strong little beggar, though! Needn't tell me\nyou don't know a good thing when you see it! So I'm 'da-da,' am I?”\n he went on, unhesitatingly accepting as the pure gold of knowledge the\nshameless imitation vocabulary his son was foisting upon him. “Well, I\nexpect I am, and--”\n\n“Oh, Cyril!” The door had opened, and Marie was in the room. If she gave\na start of surprise at her husband's unaccustomed attitude, she quickly\ncontrolled herself. “Julia said you wanted me. I must have been going\ndown the back stairs when you came up the front, and--”\n\n“Please, Mrs. Henshaw, is it Dot you have in here, or Dimple?” asked a\nnew voice, as the second nurse entered by another door.\n\nBefore Mrs. Henshaw could answer, Cyril, who had got to his feet, turned\nsharply.\n\n“Is it--_who_?” he demanded.\n\n“Oh! Oh, Mr. Henshaw,” stammered the girl. “I beg your pardon. I didn't\nknow you were here. It was only that I wanted to know which baby it was.\nWe thought we had Dot with us, until--”\n\n“Dot! Dimple!” exploded the man. “Do you mean to say you have given my\n_sons_ the ridiculous names of '_Dot_' and '_Dimple_'?”\n\n“Why, no--yes--well, that is--we had to call them something,” faltered\nthe nurse, as with a despairing glance at her mistress, she plunged\nthrough the doorway.\n\nCyril turned to his wife.\n\n“Marie, what is the meaning of this?” he demanded.\n\n“Why, Cyril, dear, don't--don't get so wrought up,” she begged. “It's\nonly as Mary said, we _had_ to call them something, and--”\n\n“Wrought up, indeed!” interrupted Cyril, savagely. “Who wouldn't be?\n'Dot' and 'Dimple'! Great Scott! One would think those boys were a\ncouple of kittens or puppies; that they didn't know anything--didn't\nhave any brains! But they have--if the other is anything like this one,\nat least,” he declared, pointing to his son on the floor, who, at\nthis opportune moment joined in the conversation to the extent of an\nappropriate “Ah--goo--da--da!”\n\n“There, hear that, will you?” triumphed the father. “What did I tell\nyou? That's the way he's been going on ever since I came into the room;\nThe little rascal knows me--so soon!”\n\nMarie clapped her fingers to her lips and turned her back suddenly,\nwith a spasmodic little cough; but her husband, if he noticed the\ninterruption, paid no heed.\n\n“Dot and Dimple, indeed!” he went on wrathfully. “That settles it. We'll\nname those boys to-day, Marie, _to-day!_ Not once again will I let the\nsun go down on a Dot and a Dimple under my roof.”\n\nMarie turned with a quick little cry of happiness.\n\n“Oh, Cyril, I'm so glad! I've so wanted to have them named, you know!\nAnd shall we call them Franz and Felix, as we'd talked?”\n\n“Franz, Felix, John, James, Paul, Charles--anything, so it's sane and\nsensible! I'd even adopt Calderwell's absurd Bildad and--er--Tomdad, or\nwhatever it was, rather than have those poor little chaps insulted a\nday longer with a 'Dot' and a 'Dimple.' Great Scott!” And, entirely\nforgetting what he had come to the nursery for, Cyril strode from the\nroom.\n\n“Ah--goo--spggggh!” commented baby from the middle of the floor.\n\n\nIt was on a very windy March day that Bertram Henshaw's son, Bertram,\nJr., arrived at the Strata. Billy went so far into the Valley of the\nShadow of Death for her baby that it was some days before she realized\nin all its importance the presence of the new member of her family. Even\nwhen the days had become weeks, and Bertram, Jr., was a month and a\nhalf old, the extreme lassitude and weariness of his young mother was a\nsource of ever-growing anxiety to her family and friends. Billy was so\nunlike herself, they all said.\n\n“If something could only rouse her,” suggested the Henshaw's old\nfamily physician one day. “A certain sort of mental shock--if not too\nsevere--would do the deed, I think, and with no injury--only benefit.\nHer physical condition is in just the state that needs a stimulus to\nstir it into new life and vigor.”\n\nAs it happened, this was said on a certain Monday. Two days later\nBertram's sister Kate, on her way with her husband to Mr. Hartwell's old\nhome in Vermont, stopped over in Boston for a two days' visit. She made\nher headquarters at Cyril's home, but very naturally she went, without\nmuch delay, to pay her respects to Bertram, Jr.\n\n“Mr. Hartwell's brother isn't well,” she explained to Billy, after\nthe greetings were over. “You know he's the only one left there, since\nMother and Father Hartwell came West. We shall go right on up to Vermont\nin a couple of days, but we just had to stay over long enough to see the\nbaby; and we hadn't ever seen the twins, either, you know. By the way,\nhow perfectly ridiculous Cyril is over those boys!”\n\n“Is he?” smiled Billy, faintly.\n\n“Yes. One would think there were never any babies born before, to hear\nhim talk. He thinks they're the most wonderful things in the world--and\nthey are cunning little fellows, I'll admit. But Cyril thinks they\n_know_ so much,” went on Kate, laughingly. “He's always bragging of\nsomething one or the other of them has done. Think of it--_Cyril!_ Marie\nsays it all started from the time last January when he discovered the\nnurses had been calling them Dot and Dimple.”\n\n“Yes, I know,” smiled Billy again, faintly, lifting a thin, white, very\nun-Billy-like hand to her head.\n\nKate frowned, and regarded her sister-in-law thoughtfully.\n\n“Mercy! how you look, Billy!” she exclaimed, with cheerful tactlessness.\n“They said you did, but, I declare, you look worse than I thought.”\n\nBilly's pale face reddened perceptibly.\n\n“Nonsense! It's just that I'm so--so tired,” she insisted. “I shall be\nall right soon. How did you leave the children?”\n\n“Well, and happy--'specially little Kate, because mother was going away.\nKate is mistress, you know, when I'm gone, and she takes herself very\nseriously.”\n\n“Mistress! A little thing like her! Why, she can't be more than ten or\neleven,” murmured Billy.\n\n“She isn't. She was ten last month. But you'd think she was forty, the\nairs she gives herself, sometimes. Oh, of course there's Nora, and the\ncook, and Miss Winton, the governess, there to really manage things,\nand Mother Hartwell is just around the corner; but little Kate _thinks_\nshe's managing, so she's happy.”\n\nBilly suppressed a smile. Billy was thinking that little Kate came\nnaturally by at least one of her traits.\n\n“Really, that child is impossible, sometimes,” resumed Mrs. Hartwell,\nwith a sigh. “You know the absurd things she was always saying two or\nthree years ago, when we came on to Cyril's wedding.”\n\n“Yes, I remember.”\n\n“Well, I thought she would get over it. But she doesn't. She's worse, if\nanything; and sometimes her insight, or intuition, or whatever you may\ncall it, is positively uncanny. I never know what she's going to remark\nnext, when I take her anywhere; but it's safe to say, whatever it is,\nit'll be unexpected and _usually_ embarrassing to somebody. And--is\nthat the baby?” broke off Mrs. Hartwell, as a cooing laugh and a woman's\nvoice came from the next room.\n\n“Yes. The nurse has just brought him in, I think,” said Billy.\n\n“Then I'll go right now and see him,” rejoined Kate, rising to her feet\nand hurrying into the next room.\n\nLeft alone, Billy lay back wearily in her reclining-chair. She wondered\nwhy Kate always tired her so. She wished she had had on her blue kimono,\nthen perhaps Kate would not have thought she looked so badly. Blue was\nalways more becoming to her than--\n\nBilly turned her head suddenly. From the next room had come Kate's\nclear-cut, decisive voice.\n\n“Oh, no, I don't think he looks a bit like his father. That little\nsnubby nose was never the Henshaw nose.”\n\nBilly drew in her breath sharply, and pulled herself half erect in her\nchair. From the next room came Kate's voice again, after a low murmur\nfrom the nurse.\n\n“Oh, but he isn't, I tell you. He isn't one bit of a Henshaw baby! The\nHenshaw babies are always _pretty_ ones. They have more hair, and they\nlook--well, different.”\n\nBilly gave a low cry, and struggled to her feet.\n\n“Oh, no,” spoke up Kate, in answer to another indistinct something from\nthe nurse. “I don't think he's near as pretty as the twins. Of\ncourse the twins are a good deal older, but they have such a _bright_\nlook,--and they did have, from the very first. I saw it in their tiniest\nbaby pictures. But this baby--”\n\n“_This_ baby is _mine_, please,” cut in a tremulous, but resolute voice;\nand Mrs. Hartwell turned to confront Bertram, Jr.'s mother, manifestly\nweak and trembling, but no less manifestly blazing-eyed and determined.\n\n“Why, Billy!” expostulated Mrs. Hartwell, as Billy stumbled forward and\nsnatched the child into her arms.\n\n“Perhaps he doesn't look like the Henshaw babies. Perhaps he isn't as\npretty as the twins. Perhaps he hasn't much hair, and does have a snub\nnose. He's my baby just the same, and I shall not stay calmly by and see\nhim abused! Besides, _I_ think he's prettier than the twins ever thought\nof being; and he's got all the hair I want him to have, and his nose\nis just exactly what a baby's nose ought to be!” And, with a superb\ngesture, Billy turned and bore the baby away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. BILLY AND THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY\n\n\nWhen the doctor heard from the nurse of Mrs. Hartwell's visit and what\nhad come of it, he only gave a discreet smile, as befitted himself and\nthe occasion; but to his wife privately, that night, the doctor said,\nwhen he had finished telling the story:\n\n“And I couldn't have prescribed a better pill if I'd tried!”\n\n“_Pill_--Mrs. Hartwell! Oh, Harold,” reproved the doctor's wife, mildly.\n\nBut the doctor only chuckled the more, and said:\n\n“You wait and see.”\n\nIf Billy's friends were worried before because of her lassitude and lack\nof ambition, they were almost as worried now over her amazing alertness\nand insistent activity. Day by day, almost hour by hour, she seemed to\ngain in strength; and every bit she acquired she promptly tested almost\nto the breaking point, so plainly eager was she to be well and strong.\nAnd always, from morning until night, and again from night until\nmorning, the pivot of her existence, around which swung all thoughts,\nwords, actions, and plans, was the sturdy little plump-cheeked,\nfirm-fleshed atom of humanity known as Bertram, Jr. Even Aunt Hannah\nremonstrated with her at last.\n\n“But, Billy, dear,” she exclaimed, “one would almost get the idea that\nyou thought there wasn't a thing in the world but that baby!”\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Well, do you know, sometimes I 'most think there isn't,” she retorted\nunblushingly.\n\n“Billy!” protested Aunt Hannah; then, a little severely, she demanded:\n“And who was it that just last September was calling this same\nonly-object-in-the-world a third person in your home?”\n\n“Third person, indeed! Aunt Hannah, did I? Did I really say such a\ndreadful thing as that? But I didn't know, then, of course. I couldn't\nknow how perfectly wonderful a baby is, especially such a baby as\nBertram, Jr., is. Why, Aunt Hannah, that little thing knows a whole lot\nalready. He's known me for weeks; I know he has. And ages and ages ago\nhe began to give me little smiles when he saw me. They were smiles--real\nsmiles! Oh, yes, I know nurse said they weren't smiles at the first,”\n admitted Billy, in answer to Aunt Hannah's doubting expression. “I know\nnurse said it was only wind on his stomach. Think of it--wind on his\nstomach! Just as if I didn't know the difference between my own baby's\nsmile and wind on his stomach! And you don't know how soon he began to\nfollow my moving finger with his eyes!”\n\n“Yes, I tried that one day, I remember,” observed Aunt Hannah demurely.\n“I moved my finger. He looked at the ceiling--_fixedly_.”\n\n“Well, probably he _wanted_ to look at the ceiling, then,” defended the\nyoung mother, promptly. “I'm sure I wouldn't give a snap for a baby if\nhe didn't sometimes have a mind of his own, and exercise it!”\n\n“Oh, Billy, Billy,” laughed Aunt Hannah, with a shake of her head as\nBilly turned away, chin uptilted.\n\nBy the time Bertram, Jr., was three months old, Billy was unmistakably\nher old happy, merry self, strong and well. Affairs at the Strata once\nmore were moving as by clockwork--only this time it was a baby's hand\nthat set the clock, and that wound it, too.\n\nBilly told her husband very earnestly that now they had entered upon a\nperiod of Enormous Responsibility. The Life, Character, and Destiny of a\nHuman Soul was intrusted to their care, and they must be Wise, Faithful,\nand Efficient. They must be at once Proud and Humble at this their Great\nOpportunity. They must Observe, Learn, and Practice. First and foremost\nin their eyes must always be this wonderful Important Trust.\n\nBertram laughed at first very heartily at Billy's instructions, which,\nhe declared, were so bristling with capitals that he could fairly see\nthem drop from her lips. Then, when he found how really very much in\nearnest she was, and how hurt she was at his levity, he managed to pull\nhis face into something like sobriety while she talked to him, though he\ndid persist in dropping kisses on her cheeks, her chin, her finger-tips,\nher hair, and the little pink lobes of her ears--“just by way of\npunctuation” to her sentences, he said. And he told her that he wasn't\nreally slighting her lips, only that they moved so fast he could not\ncatch them. Whereat Billy pouted, and told him severely that he was a\nbad, naughty boy, and that he did not deserve to be the father of the\ndearest, most wonderful baby in the world.\n\n“No, I know I don't,” beamed Bertram, with cheerful unrepentance; “but I\nam, just the same,” he finished triumphantly. And this time he contrived\nto find his wife's lips.\n\n“Oh, Bertram,” sighed Billy, despairingly.\n\n“You're an old dear, of course, and one just can't be cross with you;\nbut you don't, you just _don't_ realize your Immense Responsibility.”\n\n“Oh, yes, I do,” maintained Bertram so seriously that even Billy herself\nalmost believed him.\n\nIn spite of his assertions, however, it must be confessed that Bertram\nwas much more inclined to regard the new member of his family as just\nhis son rather than as an Important Trust; and there is little doubt\nthat he liked to toss him in the air and hear his gleeful crows of\ndelight, without any bother of Observing him at all. As to the Life and\nCharacter and Destiny intrusted to his care, it is to be feared that\nBertram just plain gloried in his son, poked him in the ribs, and\nchuckled him under the chin whenever he pleased, and gave never so much\nas a thought to Character and Destiny. It is to be feared, too, that he\nwas Proud without being Humble, and that the only Opportunity he really\nappreciated was the chance to show off his wife and baby to some less\nfortunate fellow-man.\n\nBut not so Billy. Billy joined a Mothers' Club and entered a class in\nChild Training with an elaborate system of Charts, Rules, and Tests. She\nsubscribed to each new “Mothers' Helper,” and the like, that she came\nacross, devouring each and every one with an eagerness that was tempered\nonly by a vague uneasiness at finding so many differences of opinion\namong Those Who Knew.\n\nUndeniably Billy, if not Bertram, was indeed realizing the Enormous\nResponsibility, and was keeping ever before her the Important Trust.\n\nIn June Bertram took a cottage at the South Shore, and by the time the\nreally hot weather arrived the family were well settled. It was only an\nhour away from Boston, and easy of access, but William said he guessed\nhe would not go; he would stay in Boston, sleeping at the house, and\ngetting his meals at the club, until the middle of July, when he was\ngoing down in Maine for his usual fishing trip, which he had planned to\ntake a little earlier than usual this year.\n\n“But you'll be so lonesome, Uncle William,” Billy demurred, “in this\ngreat house all alone!”\n\n“Oh, no, I sha'n't,” rejoined Uncle William. “I shall only be sleeping\nhere, you know,” he finished, with a slightly peculiar smile.\n\nIt was well, perhaps, that Billy did not exactly realize the\nsignificance of that smile, nor the unconscious emphasis on the word\n“sleeping,” for it would have troubled her not a little.\n\nWilliam, to tell the truth, was quite anticipating that sleeping.\nWilliam's nights had not been exactly restful since the baby came. His\nevenings, too, had not been the peaceful things they were wont to be.\n\nSome of Billy's Rules and Tests were strenuously objected to on the part\nof her small son, and the young man did not hesitate to show it. Billy\nsaid that it was good for the baby to cry, that it developed his lungs;\nbut William was very sure that it was not good for _him_. Certainly,\nwhen the baby did cry, William never could help hovering near the center\nof disturbance, and he always _had_ to remind Billy that it might be a\npin, you know, or some cruel thing that was hurting. As if he, William,\na great strong man, could sit calmly by and smoke a pipe, or lie in his\ncomfortable bed and sleep, while that blessed little baby was crying\nhis heart out like that! Of course, if one did not _know_ he was\ncrying--Hence William's anticipation of those quiet, restful nights when\nhe could not know it.\n\nVery soon after Billy's arrival at the cottage, Aunt Hannah and Alice\nGreggory came down for a day's visit. Aunt Hannah had been away from\nBoston for several weeks, so it was some time since she had seen the\nbaby.\n\n“My, but hasn't he grown!” she exclaimed, picking the baby up and\nstooping to give him a snuggling kiss. The next instant she almost\ndropped the little fellow, so startling had been Billy's cry.\n\n“No, no, wait, Aunt Hannah, please,” Billy was entreating, hurrying to\nthe little corner cupboard. In a moment she was back with a small bottle\nand a bit of antiseptic cotton. “We always sterilize our lips now before\nwe kiss him--it's so much safer, you know.”\n\nAunt Hannah sat down limply, the baby still in her arms.\n\n“Fiddlededee, Billy! What an absurd idea! What have you got in that\nbottle?”\n\n“Why, Aunt Hannah, it's just a little simple listerine,” bridled Billy,\n“and it isn't absurd at all. It's very sensible. My 'Hygienic Guide for\nMothers' says--”\n\n“Well, I suppose I may kiss his hand,” interposed Aunt Hannah, just a\nlittle curtly, “without subjecting myself to a City Hospital treatment!”\n\nBilly laughed shamefacedly, but she still held her ground.\n\n“No, you can't--nor even his foot. He might get them in his mouth. Aunt\nHannah, why does a baby think that everything, from his own toes to his\nfather's watch fob and the plush balls on a caller's wrist-bag, is made\nto eat? As if I could sterilize everything, and keep him from getting\nhold of germs somewhere!”\n\n“You'll have to have a germ-proof room for him,” laughed Alice Greggory,\nplayfully snapping her fingers at the baby in Aunt Hannah's lap.\n\nBilly turned eagerly.\n\n“Oh, did you read about that, too?” she cried. “I thought it was _so_\ninteresting, and I wondered if I could do it.”\n\nAlice stared frankly.\n\n“You don't mean to say they actually _have_ such things,” she\nchallenged.\n\n“Well, I read about them in a magazine,” asserted Billy, “--how you\ncould have a germ-proof room. They said it was very simple, too. Just\npasteurize the air, you know, by heating it to one hundred and ten\nand one-half degrees Fahrenheit for seventeen and one-half minutes. I\nremember just the figures.”\n\n“Simple, indeed! It sounds so,” scoffed Aunt Hannah, with uplifted\neyebrows.\n\n“Oh, well, I couldn't do it, of course,” admitted Billy, regretfully.\n“Bertram never'd stand for that in the world. He's always rushing in to\nshow the baby off to every Tom, Dick and Harry and his wife that comes;\nand of course if you opened the nursery door, that would let in those\ngerm things, and you _couldn't_ very well pasteurize your callers by\nheating them to one hundred and ten and one-half degrees for seventeen\nand one-half minutes! I don't see how you could manage such a room,\nanyway, unless you had a system of--of rooms like locks, same as they do\nfor water in canals.”\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience--locks, indeed!” almost groaned Aunt\nHannah. “Here, Alice, will you please take this child--that is, if you\nhave a germ-proof certificate about you to show to his mother. I want to\ntake off my bonnet and gloves.”\n\n“Take him? Of course I'll take him,” laughed Alice; “and right under his\nmother's nose, too,” she added, with a playful grimace at Billy. “And\nwe'll make pat-a-cakes, and send the little pigs to market, and have\nsuch a beautiful time that we'll forget there ever was such a thing in\nthe world as an old germ. Eh, babykins?”\n\n“Babykins” cooed his unqualified approval of this plan; but his mother\nlooked troubled.\n\n“That's all right, Alice. You may play with him,” she frowned\ndoubtfully; “but you mustn't do it long, you know--not over five\nminutes.”\n\n“Five minutes! Well, I like that, when I've come all the way from Boston\npurposely to see him,” pouted Alice. “What's the matter now? Time for\nhis nap?”\n\n“Oh, no, not for--thirteen minutes,” replied Billy, consulting the watch\nat her belt. “But we never play with Baby more than five minutes at a\ntime. My 'Scientific Care of Infants' says it isn't wise; that with some\nbabies it's positively dangerous, until after they're six months old.\nIt makes them nervous, and forces their mind, you know,” she explained\nanxiously. “So of course we'd want to be careful. Bertram, Jr., isn't\nquite four, yet.”\n\n“Why, yes, of course,” murmured Alice, politely, stopping a pat-a-cake\nbefore it was half baked.\n\nThe infant, as if suspecting that he was being deprived of his lawful\nbaby rights, began to fret and whimper.\n\n“Poor itty sing,” crooned Aunt Hannah, who, having divested herself of\nbonnet and gloves, came hurriedly forward with outstretched hands. “Do\nthey just 'buse 'em? Come here to your old auntie, sweetems, and we'll\ngo walkee. I saw a bow-wow--such a tunnin' ickey wickey bow-wow on the\nsteps when I came in. Come, we go see ickey wickey bow-wow?”\n\n“Aunt Hannah, _please!_” protested Billy, both hands upraised in horror.\n“_Won't_ you say 'dog,' and leave out that dreadful 'ickey wickey'? Of\ncourse he can't understand things now, really, but we never know when\nhe'll begin to, and we aren't ever going to let him hear baby-talk at\nall, if we can help it. And truly, when you come to think of it, it is\nabsurd to expect a child to talk sensibly and rationally on the mental\ndiet of 'moo-moos' and 'choo-choos' served out to them. Our Professor of\nMetaphysics and Ideology in our Child Study Course says that nothing is\nso receptive and plastic as the Mind of a Little Child, and that it is\nperfectly appalling how we fill it with trivial absurdities that haven't\neven the virtue of being accurate. So that's why we're trying to be so\ncareful with Baby. You didn't mind my speaking, I know, Aunt Hannah.”\n\n“Oh, no, of course not, Billy,” retorted Aunt Hannah, a little tartly,\nand with a touch of sarcasm most unlike her gentle self. “I'm sure\nI shouldn't wish to fill this infant's plastic mind with anything so\nappalling as trivial inaccuracies. May I be pardoned for suggesting,\nhowever,” she went on as the baby's whimper threatened to become a lusty\nwail, “that this young gentleman cries as if he were sleepy and hungry?”\n\n“Yes, he is,” admitted Billy.\n\n“Well, doesn't your system of scientific training allow him to be given\nsuch trivial absurdities as food and naps?” inquired the lady, mildly.\n\n“Of course it does, Aunt Hannah,” retorted Billy, laughing in spite of\nherself. “And it's almost time now. There are only a few more minutes to\nwait.”\n\n“Few more minutes to wait, indeed!” scorned Aunt Hannah. “I suppose the\npoor little fellow might cry and cry, and you wouldn't set that clock\nahead by a teeny weeny minute!”\n\n“Certainly not,” said the young mother, decisively. “My 'Daily Guide for\nMothers' says that a time for everything and everything in its time, is\nthe very A B C and whole alphabet of Right Training. He does everything\nby the clock, and to the minute,” declared Billy, proudly.\n\nAunt Hannah sniffed, obviously skeptical and rebellious. Alice Greggory\nlaughed.\n\n“Aunt Hannah looks as if she'd like to bring down her clock that strikes\nhalf an hour ahead,” she said mischievously; but Aunt Hannah did not\ndeign to answer this.\n\n“How long do you rock him?” she demanded of Billy. “I suppose I may do\nthat, mayn't I?”\n\n“Mercy, I don't rock him at all, Aunt Hannah,” exclaimed Billy.\n\n“Nor sing to him?”\n\n“Certainly not.”\n\n“But you did--before I went away. I remember that you did.”\n\n“Yes, I know I did,” admitted Billy, “and I had an awful time, too.\nSome evenings, every single one of us, even to Uncle William, had to\ntry before we could get him off to sleep. But that was before I got my\n'Efficiency of Mother and Child,' or my 'Scientific Training,' and, oh,\nlots of others. You see, I didn't know a thing then, and I loved to rock\nhim, so I did it--though the nurse said it wasn't good for him; but I\ndidn't believe _her_. I've had an awful time changing; but I've done it.\nI just put him in his little crib, or his carriage, and after a while\nhe goes to sleep. Sometimes, now, he doesn't cry hardly any. I'm afraid,\nto-day, though, he will,” she worried.\n\n“Yes, I'm afraid he will,” almost screamed Aunt Hannah, in order to make\nherself heard above Bertram, Jr., who, by this time, was voicing his\nopinion of matters and things in no uncertain manner.\n\nIt was not, after all, so very long before peace and order reigned; and,\nin due course, Bertram, Jr., in his carriage, lay fast asleep. Then,\nwhile Aunt Hannah went to Billy's room for a short rest, Billy and Alice\nwent out on to the wide veranda which faced the wonderful expanse of sky\nand sea.\n\n“Now tell me of yourself,” commanded Billy, almost at once. “It's been\nages since I've heard or seen a thing of you.”\n\n“There's nothing to tell.”\n\n“Nonsense! But there must be,” insisted Billy. “You know it's months\nsince I've seen anything of you, hardly.”\n\n“I know. We feel quite neglected at the Annex,” said Alice.\n\n“But I don't go anywhere,” defended Billy. “I can't. There isn't time.”\n\n“Even to bring us the extra happiness?” smiled Alice.\n\nA quick change came to Billy's face. Her eyes glowed deeply.\n\n“No; though I've had so much that ought to have gone--such loads\nand loads of extra happiness, which I couldn't possibly use myself!\nSometimes I'm so happy, Alice, that--that I'm just frightened. It\ndoesn't seem as if anybody ought to be so happy.”\n\n“Oh, Billy, dear,” demurred Alice, her eyes filling suddenly with tears.\n\n“Well, I've got the Annex. I'm glad I've got that for the overflow,\nanyway,” resumed Billy, trying to steady her voice. “I've sent a whole\nlot of happiness up there mentally, if I haven't actually carried it; so\nI'm sure you must have got it. Now tell me of yourself.”\n\n“There's nothing to tell,” insisted Alice, as before.\n\n“You're working as hard as ever?”\n\n“Yes--harder.”\n\n“New pupils?”\n\n“Yes, and some concert engagements--good ones, for next season.\nAccompaniments, you know.”\n\nBilly nodded.\n\n“Yes; I've heard of you already twice, lately, in that line, and very\nflatteringly, too.”\n\n“Have you? Well, that's good.”\n\n“Hm-m.” There was a moment's silence, then, abruptly, Billy changed the\nsubject. “I had a letter from Belle Calderwell, yesterday.” She paused\nexpectantly, but there was no comment.\n\n“You don't seem interested,” she frowned, after a minute.\n\nAlice laughed.\n\n“Pardon me, but--I don't know the Lady, you see. Was it a good letter?”\n\n“You know her brother.”\n\n“Very true.” Alice's cheeks showed a deeper color. “Did she say anything\nof him?”\n\n“Yes. She said he was coming back to Boston next winter.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Yes. She says that this time he declares he really _is_ going to settle\ndown to work,” murmured Billy, demurely, with a sidelong glance at her\ncompanion. “She says he's engaged to be married--one of her friends over\nthere.”\n\nThere was no reply. Alice appeared to be absorbed in watching a tiny\nwhite sail far out at sea.\n\nAgain Billy was silent. Then, with studied carelessness, she said:\n\n“Yes, and you know Mr. Arkwright, too. She told of him.”\n\n“Yes? Well, what of him?” Alice's voice was studiedly indifferent.\n\n“Oh, there was quite a lot of him. Belle had just been to hear him\nsing, and then her brother had introduced him to her. She thinks he's\nperfectly wonderful, in every way, I should judge. In fact, she simply\nraved over him. It seems that while we've been hearing nothing from him\nall winter, he's been winning no end of laurels for himself in Paris and\nBerlin. He's been studying, too, of course, as well as singing; and\nnow he's got a chance to sing somewhere--create a rôle, or\nsomething--Belle said she wasn't quite clear on the matter herself, but\nit was a perfectly splendid chance, and one that was a fine feather in\nhis cap.”\n\n“Then he won't be coming home--that is, to Boston--at all this winter,\nprobably,” said Alice, with a cheerfulness that sounded just a little\nforced.\n\n“Not until February. But he is coming then. He's been engaged for six\nperformances with the Boston Opera Company--as a star tenor, mind you!\nIsn't that splendid?”\n\n“Indeed it is,” murmured Alice.\n\n“Belle writes that Hugh says he's improved wonderfully, and that even he\ncan see that his singing is marvelous. He says Paris is wild over him;\nbut--for my part, I wish he'd come home and stay here where he belongs,”\n finished Billy, a bit petulantly.\n\n“Why, why, Billy!” murmured her friend, a curiously startled look coming\ninto her eyes.\n\n“Well, I do,” maintained Billy; then, recklessly, she added: “I had such\nbeautiful plans for him, once, Alice. Oh, if you only could have cared\nfor him, you'd have made such a splendid couple!”\n\nA vivid scarlet flew to Alice's face.\n\n“Nonsense!” she cried, getting quickly to her feet and bending over\none of the flower boxes along the veranda railing. “Mr. Arkwright\nnever thought of marrying me--and I'm not going to marry anybody but my\nmusic.”\n\nBilly sighed despairingly.\n\n“I know that's what you say now; but if--” She stopped abruptly. Around\nthe turn of the veranda had appeared Aunt Hannah, wheeling Bertram, Jr.,\nstill asleep in his carriage.\n\n“I came out the other door,” she explained softly. “And it was so lovely\nI just had to go in and get the baby. I thought it would be so nice for\nhim to finish his nap out here.”\n\nBilly arose with a troubled frown.\n\n“But, Aunt Hannah, he mustn't--he can't stay out here. I'm sorry, but\nwe'll have to take him back.”\n\nAunt Hannah's eyes grew mutinous.\n\n“But I thought the outdoor air was just the thing for him. I'm sure your\nscientific hygienic nonsense says _that!_”\n\n“They do--they did--that is, some of them do,” acknowledged Billy,\nworriedly; “but they differ, so! And the one I'm going by now says that\nBaby should always sleep in an _even_ temperature--seventy degrees, if\npossible; and that's exactly what the room in there was, when I left\nhim. It's not the same out here, I'm sure. In fact I looked at the\nthermometer to see, just before I came out myself. So, Aunt Hannah, I'm\nafraid I'll have to take him back.”\n\n“But you used to have him sleep out of doors all the time, on that\nlittle balcony out of your room,” argued Aunt Hannah, still plainly\nunconvinced.\n\n“Yes, I know I did. I was following the other man's rules, then. As I\nsaid, if only they wouldn't differ so! Of course I want the best; but\nit's so hard to always know the best, and--”\n\nAt this very inopportune moment Master Bertram took occasion to wake\nup, which brought even a deeper wrinkle of worry to his fond mother's\nforehead; for she said that, according to the clock, he should have been\nsleeping exactly ten and one-half more minutes, and that of course he\ncouldn't commence the next thing until those ten and one-half minutes\nwere up, or else his entire schedule for the day would be shattered.\nSo what she should do with him for those should-have-been-sleeping ten\nminutes and a half, she did not know. All of which drew from Aunt Hannah\nthe astounding exclamation of:\n\n“Oh, my grief and conscience, Billy, if you aren't the--the limit!”\n Which, indeed, she must have been, to have brought circumspect Aunt\nHannah to the point of actually using slang.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. A NIGHT OFF\n\n\nThe Henshaw family did not return to the Strata until late in September.\nBilly said that the sea air seemed to agree so well with the baby it\nwould be a pity to change until the weather became really too cool at\nthe shore to be comfortable.\n\nWilliam came back from his fishing trip in August, and resumed his old\nhabit of sleeping at the house and taking his meals at the club. To be\nsure, for a week he went back and forth between the city and the beach\nhouse; but it happened to be a time when Bertram, Jr., was cutting a\ntooth, and this so wore upon William's sympathy--William still could not\nhelp insisting it _might_ be a pin--that he concluded peace lay only in\nflight. So he went back to the Strata.\n\nBertram had stayed at the cottage all summer, painting industriously.\nHeretofore he had taken more of a vacation through the summer months,\nbut this year there seemed to be nothing for him to do but to paint. He\ndid not like to go away on a trip and leave Billy, and she declared she\ncould not take the baby nor leave him, and that she did not need any\ntrip, anyway.\n\n“All right, then, we'll just stay at the beach, and have a fine vacation\ntogether,” he had answered her.\n\nAs Bertram saw it, however, he could detect very little “vacation”\n to it. Billy had no time for anything but the baby. When she was not\nactually engaged in caring for it, she was studying how to care for it.\nNever had she been sweeter or dearer, and never had Bertram loved her\nhalf so well. He was proud, too, of her devotion, and of her triumphant\nsuccess as a mother; but he did wish that sometimes, just once in a\nwhile, she would remember she was a wife, and pay a little attention to\nhim, her husband.\n\nBertram was ashamed to own it, even to himself, but he was feeling just\na little abused that summer; and he knew that, in his heart, he was\nactually getting jealous of his own son, in spite of his adoration of\nthe little fellow. He told himself defensively that it was not to be\nexpected that he should not want the love of his wife, the attentions of\nhis wife, and the companionship of his wife--a part of the time. It was\nnothing more than natural that occasionally he should like to see her\nshow some interest in subjects not mentioned in Mothers' Guides and\nScientific Trainings of Infants; and he did not believe he could be\nblamed for wanting his residence to be a home for himself as well as a\nnursery for his offspring.\n\nEven while he thus discontentedly argued with himself, however, Bertram\ncalled himself a selfish brute just to think such things when he had\nso dear and loving a wife as Billy, and so fine and splendid a baby as\nBertram, Jr. He told himself, too, that very likely when they were back\nin their own house again, and when motherhood was not so new to her,\nBilly would not be so absorbed in the baby. She would return to her old\ninterest in her husband, her music, her friends, and her own personal\nappearance. Meanwhile there was always, of course, for him, his\npainting. So he would paint, accepting gladly what crumbs of attention\nfell from the baby's table, and trust to the future to make Billy none\nthe less a mother, perhaps, but a little more the wife.\n\nJust how confidently he was counting on this coming change, Bertram\nhardly realized himself; but certainly the family was scarcely settled\nat the Strata before the husband gayly proposed one evening that he and\nBilly should go to the theater to see “Romeo and Juliet.”\n\nBilly was clearly both surprised and shocked.\n\n“Why, Bertram, I can't--you know I can't!” she exclaimed reprovingly.\n\nBertram's heart sank; but he kept a brave front.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“What a question! As if I'd leave Baby!”\n\n“But, Billy, dear, you'd be gone less than three hours, and you say\nDelia's the most careful of nurses.”\n\nBilly's forehead puckered into an anxious frown.\n\n“I can't help it. Something might happen to him, Bertram. I couldn't be\nhappy a minute.”\n\n“But, dearest, aren't you _ever_ going to leave him?” demanded the young\nhusband, forlornly.\n\n“Why, yes, of course, when it's reasonable and necessary. I went out to\nthe Annex yesterday afternoon. I was gone almost two whole hours.”\n\n“Well, did anything happen?”\n\n“N-no; but then I telephoned, you see, several times, so I _knew_\neverything was all right.”\n\n“Oh, well, if that's all you want, I could telephone, you know, between\nevery act,” suggested Bertram, with a sarcasm that was quite lost on the\nearnest young mother.\n\n“Y-yes, you could do that, couldn't you?” conceded Billy; “and, of\ncourse, I _haven't_ been anywhere much, lately.”\n\n“Indeed I could,” agreed Bertram, with a promptness that carefully hid\nhis surprise at her literal acceptance of what he had proposed as a huge\njoke. “Come, is it a go? Shall I telephone to see if I can get seats?”\n\n“You think Baby'll surely be all right?”\n\n“I certainly do.”\n\n“And you'll telephone home between every act?”\n\n“I will.” Bertram's voice sounded almost as if he were repeating the\nmarriage service.\n\n“And we'll come straight home afterwards as fast as John and Peggy can\nbring us?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“Then I think--I'll--go,” breathed Billy, tremulously, plainly showing\nwhat a momentous concession she thought she was making. “I do love\n'Romeo and Juliet,' and I haven't seen it for ages!”\n\n“Good! Then I'll find out about the tickets,” cried Bertram, so elated\nat the prospect of having an old-time evening out with his wife that\neven the half-hourly telephones did not seem too great a price to pay.\n\nWhen the time came, they were a little late in starting. Baby\nwas fretful, and though Billy usually laid him in his crib and\nunhesitatingly left the room, insisting that he should go to sleep by\nhimself in accordance with the most approved rules in her Scientific\nTraining; yet to-night she could not bring herself to the point of\nleaving the house until he was quiet. Hurried as they were when they\ndid start, Billy was conscious of Bertram's frowning disapproval of her\nfrock.\n\n“You don't like it, of course, dear, and I don't blame you,” she smiled\nremorsefully.\n\n“Oh, I like it--that is, I did, when it was new,” rejoined her husband,\nwith apologetic frankness. “But, dear, didn't you have anything else?\nThis looks almost--well, mussy, you know.”\n\n“No--well, yes, maybe there were others,” admitted Billy; “but this\nwas the quickest and easiest to get into, and it all came just as I\nwas getting Baby ready for bed, you know. I am a fright, though, I'll\nacknowledge, so far as clothes go. I haven't had time to get a thing\nsince Baby came. I must get something right away, I suppose.”\n\n“Yes, indeed,” declared Bertram, with emphasis, hurrying his wife into\nthe waiting automobile.\n\nBilly had to apologize again at the theater, for the curtain had already\nrisen on the ancient quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague,\nand Billy knew her husband's special abhorrence of tardy arrivals.\nLater, though, when well established in their seats, Billy's mind was\nplainly not with the players on the stage.\n\n“Do you suppose Baby _is_ all right?” she whispered, after a time.\n\n“Sh-h! Of course he is, dear!”\n\nThere was a brief silence, during which Billy peered at her program in\nthe semi-darkness. Then she nudged her husband's arm ecstatically.\n\n“Bertram, I couldn't have chosen a better play if I'd tried. There\nare _five_ acts! I'd forgotten there were so many. That means you can\ntelephone four times!”\n\n“Yes, dear.” Bertram's voice was sternly cheerful.\n\n“You must be sure they tell you exactly how Baby is.”\n\n“All right, dear. Sh-h! Here's Romeo.”\n\nBilly subsided. She even clapped a little in spasmodic enthusiasm.\nPresently she peered at her program again.\n\n“There wouldn't be time, I suppose, to telephone between the scenes,”\n she hazarded wistfully. “There are sixteen of those!”\n\n“Well, hardly! Billy, you aren't paying one bit of attention to the\nplay!”\n\n“Why, of course I am,” whispered Billy, indignantly. “I think it's\nperfectly lovely, and I'm perfectly contented, too--since I found\nout about those five acts, and as long as I _can't_ have the sixteen\nscenes,” she added, settling back in her seat.\n\nAs if to prove that she was interested in the play, her next whisper,\nsome time later, had to do with one of the characters on the stage.\n\n“Who's that--the nurse? Mercy! We wouldn't want her for Baby, would we?”\n\nIn spite of himself Bertram chuckled this time. Billy, too, laughed at\nherself. Then, resolutely, she settled into her seat again.\n\nThe curtain was not fairly down on the first act before Billy had laid\nan urgent hand on her husband's arm.\n\n“Now, remember; ask if he's waked up, or anything,” she directed. “And\nbe sure to say I'll come right home if they need me. Now hurry.”\n\n“Yes, dear.” Bertram rose with alacrity. “I'll be back right away.”\n\n“Oh, but I don't want you to hurry _too_ much,” she called after him,\nsoftly. “I want you to take plenty of time to ask questions.”\n\n“All right,” nodded Bertram, with a quizzical smile, as he turned away.\n\nObediently Bertram asked all the question she could think of, then came\nback to his wife. There was nothing in his report that even Billy could\ndisapprove of, or worry about; and with almost a contented look on her\nface she turned toward the stage as the curtain went up on the second\nact.\n\n“I love this balcony scene,” she sighed happily.\n\nRomeo, however, had not half finished his impassioned love-making when\nBilly clutched her husband's arm almost fiercely.\n\n“Bertram,” she fairly hissed in a tragic whisper, “I've just happened\nto think! Won't it be awful when Baby falls in love? I know I shall just\nhate that girl for taking him away from me!”\n\n“Sh-h! _Billy!_” expostulated her husband, choking with half-stifled\nlaughter. “That woman in front heard you, I know she did!”\n\n“Well, I shall,” sighed Billy, mournfully, turning back to the stage.\n\n   “'Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,\n     That I shall say good night, till it be morrow,”'\n\nsighed Juliet passionately to her Romeo.\n\n“Mercy! I hope not,” whispered Billy flippantly in Bertram's ear. “I'm\nsure I don't want to stay here till to-morrow! I want to go home and see\nBaby.”\n\n“_Billy!_” pleaded Bertram so despairingly, that Billy, really\nconscience-smitten, sat back in her seat and remained, for the rest of\nthe act, very quiet indeed.\n\nDeceived by her apparent tranquillity, Bertram turned as the curtain\nwent down.\n\n“Now, Billy, surely you don't think it'll be necessary to telephone so\nsoon as this again,” he ventured.\n\nBilly's countenance fell.\n\n“But, Bertram, you _said_ you would! Of course if you aren't willing\nto--but I've been counting on hearing all through this horrid long act,\nand--”\n\n“Goodness me, Billy, I'll telephone every minute for you, of course, if\nyou want me to,” cried Bertram, springing to his feet, and trying not to\nshow his impatience.\n\nHe was back more promptly this time.\n\n“Everything O. K.,” he smiled reassuringly into Billy's anxious eyes.\n“Delia said she'd just been up, and the little chap was sound asleep.”\n\nTo the man's unbounded surprise, his wife grew actually white.\n\n“Up! Up!” she exclaimed. “Do you mean that Delia went down-stairs to\n_stay_, and left my baby up there alone?”\n\n“But, Billy, she said he was all right,” murmured Bertram, softly,\ncasting uneasy sidelong glances at his too interested neighbors.\n\n“'All right'! Perhaps he was, _then_--but he may not be, later. Delia\nshould stay in the next room all the time, where she could hear the\nleast thing.”\n\n“Yes, dear, she will, I'm sure, if you tell her to,” soothed Bertram,\nquickly. “It'll be all right next time.”\n\nBilly shook her head. She was obviously near to crying.\n\n“But, Bertram, I can't stand it to sit here enjoying myself all safe and\ncomfortable, and know that Baby is _alone_ up there in that great big\nroom! Please, _please_ won't you go and telephone Delia to go up _now_\nand stay there?”\n\nBertram, weary, sorely tried, and increasingly aware of those annoyingly\ninterested neighbors, was on the point of saying a very decided no; but\na glance into Billy's pleading eyes settled it. Without a word he went\nback to the telephone.\n\nThe curtain was up when he slipped into his seat, very red of face. In\nanswer to Billy's hurried whisper he shook his head; but in the short\npause between the first and second scenes he said, in a low voice:\n\n“I'm sorry, Billy, but I couldn't get the house at all.”\n\n“Couldn't get them! But you'd just been talking with them!”\n\n“That's exactly it, probably. I had just telephoned, so they weren't\nwatching for the bell. Anyhow, I couldn't get them.”\n\n“Then you didn't get Delia at all!”\n\n“Of course not.”\n\n“And Baby is still--all alone!”\n\n“But he's all right, dear. Delia's keeping watch of him.”\n\nFor a moment there was silence; then, with clear decisiveness came\nBilly's voice.\n\n“Bertram, I am going home.”\n\n“Billy!”\n\n“I am.”\n\n“Billy, for heaven's sake don't be a silly goose! The play's half over\nalready. We'll soon be going, anyway.”\n\nBilly's lips came together in a thin little determined line.\n\n“Bertram, I am going home now, please,” she said. “You needn't come with\nme; I can go alone.”\n\nBertram said two words under his breath which it was just as well,\nperhaps, that Billy--and the neighbors--did not hear; then he gathered\nup their wraps and, with Billy, stalked out of the theater.\n\nAt home everything was found to be absolutely as it should be.\nBertram, Jr., was peacefully sleeping, and Delia, who had come up from\ndownstairs, was sewing in the next room.\n\n“There, you see,” observed Bertram, a little sourly.\n\nBilly drew a long, contented sigh.\n\n“Yes, I see; everything is all right. But that's exactly what I wanted\nto do, Bertram, you know--to _see for myself_,” she finished happily.\n\nAnd Bertram, looking at her rapt face as she hovered over the baby's\ncrib, called himself a brute and a beast to mind _anything_ that could\nmake Billy look like that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. “SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT”\n\n\nBertram did not ask Billy very soon again to go to the theater. For some\ndays, indeed, he did not ask her to do anything. Then, one evening, he\ndid beg for some music.\n\n“Billy, you haven't played to me or sung to me since I could remember,”\n he complained. “I want some music.”\n\nBilly gave a merry laugh and wriggled her fingers experimentally.\n\n“Mercy, Bertram! I don't believe I could play a note. You know I'm all\nout of practice.”\n\n“But why _don't_ you practice?”\n\n“Why, Bertram, I can't. In the first place I don't seem to have any time\nexcept when Baby's asleep; and I can't play then-I'd wake him up.”\n\nBertram sighed irritably, rose to his feet, and began to walk up and\ndown the room. He came to a pause at last, his eyes bent a trifle\ndisapprovingly on his wife.\n\n“Billy, dear, _don't_ you wear anything but those wrapper things\nnowadays?” he asked plaintively.\n\nAgain Billy laughed. But this time a troubled frown followed the laugh.\n\n“I know, Bertram, I suppose they do look dowdy, sometimes,” she\nconfessed; “but, you see, I hate to wear a really good dress--Baby\nrumples them up so; and I'm usually in a hurry to get to him mornings,\nand these are so easy to slip into, and so much more comfortable for me\nto handle him in!”\n\n“Yes, of course, of course; I see,” mumbled Bertram, listlessly taking\nup his walk again.\n\nBilly, after a moment's silence, began to talk animatedly. Baby had done\na wonderfully cunning thing that morning, and Billy had not had a chance\nyet to tell Bertram. Baby was growing more and more cunning anyway,\nthese days, and there were several things she believed she had not told\nhim; so she told them now.\n\nBertram listened politely, interestedly. He told himself that he _was_\ninterested, too. Of course he was interested in the doings of his own\nchild! But he still walked up and down the room a little restlessly,\ncoming to a halt at last by the window, across which the shade had not\nbeen drawn.\n\n“Billy,” he cried suddenly, with his old boyish eagerness, “there's\na glorious moon. Come on! Let's take a little walk--a real\nfellow-and-his-best-girl walk! Will you?”\n\n“Mercy! dear, I couldn't,” cried Billy springing to her feet. “I'd love\nto, though, if I could,” she added hastily, as she saw disappointment\ncloud her husband's face. “But I told Delia she might go out. It isn't\nher regular evening, of course, but I told her I didn't mind staying\nwith Baby a bit. So I'll have to go right up now. She'll be going soon.\nBut, dear, you go and take your walk. It'll do you good. Then you can\ncome back and tell me all about it--only you must come in quietly, so\nnot to wake the baby,” she finished, giving her husband an affectionate\nkiss, as she left the room.\n\nAfter a disconsolate five minutes of solitude, Bertram got his hat and\ncoat and went out for his walk--but he told himself he did not expect to\nenjoy it.\n\nBertram Henshaw knew that the old rebellious jealousy of the summer had\nhim fast in its grip. He was heartily ashamed of himself, but he could\nnot help it. He wanted Billy, and he wanted her then. He wanted to talk\nto her. He wanted to tell her about a new portrait commission he had\njust obtained; and he wanted to ask her what she thought of the idea of\na brand-new “Face of a Girl” for the Bohemian Ten Exhibition next March.\nHe wanted--but then, what would be the use? She would listen, of course,\nbut he would know by the very looks of her face that she would not be\nreally thinking of what he was saying; and he would be willing to wager\nhis best canvas that in the very first pause she would tell about the\nbaby's newest tooth or latest toy. Not but that he liked to hear about\nthe little fellow, of course; and not but that he was proud as Punch\nof him, too; but that he would like sometimes to hear Billy talk of\nsomething else. The sweetest melody in the world, if dinned into one's\nears day and night, became something to be fled from.\n\nAnd Billy ought to talk of something else, too! Bertram, Jr., wonderful\nas he was, really was not the only thing in the world, or even the only\nbaby; and other people--outsiders, their friends--had a right to\nexpect that sometimes other matters might be considered--their own, for\ninstance. But Billy seemed to have forgotten this. No matter whether\nthe subject of conversation had to do with the latest novel or a trip\nto Europe, under Billy's guidance it invariably led straight to Baby's\nJack-and-Jill book, or to a perambulator journey in the Public Garden.\nIf it had not been so serious, it would have been really funny the way\nall roads led straight to one goal. He himself, when alone with Billy,\nhad started the most unusual and foreign subjects, sometimes, just to\nsee if there were not somewhere a little bypath that did not bring up in\nhis own nursery. He never, however, found one.\n\nBut it was not funny; it was serious. Was this glorious gift on\nparenthood to which he had looked forward as the crowning joy of his\nexistence, to be nothing but a tragedy that would finally wreck his\ndomestic happiness? It could not be. It must not be. He must be patient,\nand wait. Billy loved him. He was sure she did. By and by this obsession\nof motherhood, which had her so fast in its grasp, would relax. She\nwould remember that her husband had rights as well as her child. Once\nagain she would give him the companionship, love, and sympathetic\ninterest so dear to him. Meanwhile there was his work. He must bury\nhimself in that. And fortunate, indeed, he was, he told himself, that he\nhad something so absorbing.\n\nIt was at this point in his meditations that Bertram rounded a corner\nand came face to face with a man who stopped him short with a jovial:\n\n“Isn't it--by George, it is Bertie Henshaw! Well, what do you think of\nthat for luck?--and me only two days home from 'Gay Paree'!”\n\n“Oh, Seaver! How are you? You _are_ a stranger!” Bertram's voice and\nhandshake were a bit more cordial than they would have been had he not\nat the moment been feeling so abused and forlorn. In the old days he had\nliked this Bob Seaver well. Seaver was an artist like himself, and was\ngood company always. But Seaver and his crowd were a little too Bohemian\nfor William's taste; and after Billy came, she, too, had objected to\nwhat she called “that horrid Seaver man.” In his heart, Bertram knew\nthat there was good foundation for their objections, so he had avoided\nSeaver for a time; and for some years, now, the man had been abroad,\nsomewhat to Bertram's relief. To-night, however, Seaver's genial smile\nand hearty friendliness were like a sudden burst of sunshine on a rainy\nday--and Bertram detested rainy days. He was feeling now, too, as if he\nhad just had a whole week of them.\n\n“Yes, I am something of a stranger here,” nodded Seaver. “But I tell you\nwhat, little old Boston looks mighty good to me, all the same. Come on!\nYou're just the fellow we want. I'm on my way now to the old stamping\nground. Come--right about face, old chap, and come with me!”\n\nBertram shook his head.\n\n“Sorry--but I guess I can't, to-night,” he sighed. Both gesture and\nwords were unhesitating, but the voice carried the discontent of a small\nboy, who, while the sun is still shining, has been told to come into the\nhouse.\n\n“Oh, rats! Yes, you can, too. Come on! Lots of the old crowd will be\nthere--Griggs, Beebe, Jack Jenkins, and Tully. We need you to complete\nthe show.”\n\n“Jack Jenkins? Is he here?” A new eagerness had come into Bertram's\nvoice.\n\n“Sure! He came on from New York last night. Great boy, Jenkins! Just\nback from Paris fairly covered with medals, you know.”\n\n“Yes, so I hear. I haven't seen him for four years.”\n\n“Better come to-night then.”\n\n“No-o,” began Bertram, with obvious reluctance. “It's already nine\no'clock, and--”\n\n“Nine o'clock!” cut in Seaver, with a broad grin. “Since when has your\nlimit been nine o'clock? I've seen the time when you didn't mind nine\no'clock in the morning, Bertie! What's got--Oh, I remember. I met\nanother friend of yours in Berlin; chap named Arkwright--and say, he's\nsome singer, you bet! You're going to hear of him one of these days.\nWell, he told me all about how you'd settled down now--son and heir,\nfireside bliss, pretty wife, and all the fixings. But, I say, Bertie,\ndoesn't she let you out--_any_?”\n\n“Nonsense, Seaver!” flared Bertram in annoyed wrath.\n\n“Well, then, why don't you come to-night? If you want to see Jenkins\nyou'll have to; he's going back to New York to-morrow.”\n\nFor only a brief minute longer did Bertram hesitate; then he turned\nsquarely about with an air of finality.\n\n“Is he? Well, then, perhaps I will,” he said. “I'd hate to miss Jenkins\nentirely.”\n\n“Good!” exclaimed his companion, as they fell into step. “Have a cigar?”\n\n“Thanks. Don't mind if I do.”\n\nIf Bertram's chin was a little higher and his step a little more decided\nthan usual, it was all merely by way of accompaniment to his thoughts.\n\nCertainly it was right that he should go, and it was sensible. Indeed,\nit was really almost imperative--due to Billy, as it were--after that\ndisagreeable taunt of Seaver's. As if she did not want him to go when\nand where he pleased! As if she would consent for a moment to figure\nin the eyes of his friends as a tyrannical wife who objected to her\nhusband's passing a social evening with his friends! To be sure, in this\nparticular case, she might not favor Seaver's presence, but even she\nwould not mind this once--and, anyhow, it was Jenkins that was the\nattraction, not Seaver. Besides, he himself was no undeveloped boy now.\nHe was a man, presumedly able to take care of himself. Besides, again,\nhad not Billy herself told him to go out and enjoy the evening without\nher, as she had to stay with the baby? He would telephone her, of\ncourse, that he had met some old friends, and that he might be late;\nthen she would not worry.\n\nAnd forthwith, having settled the matter in his mind, and to his\ncomplete satisfaction, Bertram gave his undivided attention to Seaver,\nwho had already plunged into an account of a recent Art Exhibition he\nhad attended in Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. GHOSTS THAT WALKED FOR BERTRAM\n\n\nOctober proved to be unusually mild, and about the middle of the month,\nBertram, after much unselfish urging on the part of Billy, went to a\nfriend's camp in the Adirondacks for a week's stay. He came back with an\nangry, lugubrious face--and a broken arm.\n\n“Oh, Bertram! And your right one, too--the same one you broke before!”\n mourned Billy, tearfully.\n\n“Of course,” retorted Bertram, trying in vain to give an air of\njauntiness to his reply. “Didn't want to be too changeable, you know!”\n\n“But how did you do it, dear?”\n\n“Fell into a silly little hole covered with underbrush. But--oh, Billy,\nwhat's the use? I did it, and I can't undo it--more's the pity!”\n\n“Of course you can't, you poor boy,” sympathized Billy; “and you sha'n't\nbe tormented with questions. We'll just be thankful 'twas no worse. You\ncan't paint for a while, of course; but we won't mind that. It'll just\ngive Baby and me a chance to have you all to ourselves for a time, and\nwe'll love that!'\n\n“Yes, of course,” sighed Bertram, so abstractedly that Billy bridled\nwith pretty resentment.\n\n“Well, I like your enthusiasm, sir,” she frowned. “I'm afraid you don't\nappreciate the blessings you do have, young man! Did you realize what\nI said? I remarked that you could be with _Baby_ and _me_,” she\nemphasized.\n\nBertram laughed, and gave his wife an affectionate kiss.\n\n“Indeed I do appreciate my blessings, dear--when those blessings are\nsuch treasures as you and Baby, but--” Only his doleful eyes fixed on\nhis injured arm finished his sentence.\n\n“I know, dear, of course, and I understand,” murmured Billy, all\ntenderness at once.\n\n\nThey were not easy for Bertram--those following days. Once again he\nwas obliged to accept the little intimate personal services that he\nso disliked. Once again he could do nothing but read, or wander\ndisconsolately into his studio and gaze at his half-finished “Face of\na Girl.” Occasionally, it is true, driven nearly to desperation by the\nhaunting vision in his mind's eye, he picked up a brush and attempted\nto make his left hand serve his will; but a bare half-dozen irritating,\nineffectual strokes were usually enough to make him throw down his\nbrush in disgust. He never could do anything with his left hand, he told\nhimself dejectedly.\n\nMany of his hours, of course, he spent with Billy and his son, and they\nwere happy hours, too; but they always came to be restless ones before\nthe day was half over. Billy was always devotion itself to him--when she\nwas not attending to the baby; he had no fault to find with Billy. And\nthe baby was delightful--he could find no fault with the baby. But the\nbaby _was_ fretful--he was teething, Billy said--and he needed a great\ndeal of attention; so, naturally, Bertram drifted out of the nursery,\nafter a time, and went down into his studio, where were his dear, empty\npalette, his orderly brushes, and his tantalizing “Face of a Girl.” From\nthe studio, generally, Bertram went out on to the street.\n\nSometimes he dropped into a fellow-artist's studio. Sometimes he\nstrolled into a club or café where he knew he would be likely to find\nsome friend who would help him while away a tiresome hour. Bertram's\nfriends quite vied with each other in rendering this sort of aid, so\nmuch so, indeed, that--naturally, perhaps--Bertram came to call on their\nservices more and more frequently.\n\nParticularly was this the case when, after the splints were removed,\nBertram found, as the days passed, that his arm was not improving as it\nshould improve. This not only disappointed and annoyed him, but worried\nhim. He remembered sundry disquieting warnings given by the physician\nat the time of the former break--warnings concerning the probable\nseriousness of a repetition of the injury. To Billy, of course, Bertram\nsaid nothing of all this; but just before Christmas he went to see a\nnoted specialist.\n\nAn hour later, almost in front of the learned surgeon's door, Bertram\nmet Bob Seaver.\n\n“Great Scott, Bertie, what's up?” ejaculated Seaver. “You look as if\nyou'd seen a ghost.”\n\n“I have,” answered Bertram, with grim bitterness. “I've seen the ghost\nof--of every 'Face of a Girl' I ever painted.”\n\n“Gorry! So bad as that? No wonder you look as if you'd been disporting\nin graveyards,” chuckled Seaver, laughing at his own joke “What's the\nmatter--arm on a rampage to day?”\n\nHe paused for reply, but as Bertram did not answer at once, he resumed,\nwith gay insistence: “Come on! You need cheering up. Suppose we go down\nto Trentini's and see who's there.”\n\n“All right,” agreed Bertram, dully. “Suit yourself.”\n\nBertram was not thinking of Seaver, Trentini's, or whom he might find\nthere. Bertram was thinking of certain words he had heard less than\nhalf an hour ago. He was wondering, too, if ever again he could think of\nanything but those words.\n\n“The truth?” the great surgeon had said. “Well, the truth is--I'm sorry\nto tell you the truth, Mr. Henshaw, but if you will have it--you've\npainted the last picture you'll ever paint with your right hand, I fear.\nIt's a bad case. This break, coming as it did on top of the serious\ninjury of two or three years ago, was bad enough; but, to make matters\nworse, the bone was imperfectly set and wrongly treated, which could not\nbe helped, of course, as you were miles away from skilled surgeons at\nthe time of the injury. We'll do the best we can, of course; but--well,\nyou asked for the truth, you remember; so I had to give it to you.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. THE MOTHER--THE WIFE\n\n\nBertram made up his mind at once that, for the present, at least,\nhe would tell no one what the surgeon had said to him. He had placed\nhimself under the man's care, and there was nothing to do but to take\nthe prescribed treatment and await results as patiently as he could.\nMeanwhile there was no need to worry Billy, or William, or anybody else\nwith the matter.\n\nBilly was so busy with her holiday plans that she was only vaguely aware\nof what seemed to be an increase of restlessness on the part of her\nhusband during those days just before Christmas.\n\n“Poor dear, is the arm feeling horrid to-day?” she asked one morning,\nwhen the gloom on her husband's face was deeper than usual.\n\nBertram frowned and did not answer directly.\n\n“Lots of good I am these days!” he exclaimed, his moody eyes on the\narmful of many-shaped, many-sized packages she carried. “What are those\nfor-the tree?”\n\n“Yes; and it's going to be so pretty, Bertram,” exulted Billy. “And, do\nyou know, Baby positively acts as if he suspected things--little as he\nis,” she went on eagerly. “He's as nervous as a witch. I can't keep him\nstill a minute!”\n\n“How about his mother?” hinted Bertram, with a faint smile.\n\nBilly laughed.\n\n“Well, I'm afraid she isn't exactly calm herself,” she confessed, as she\nhurried out of the room with her parcels.\n\nBertram looked after her longingly, despondently.\n\n“I wonder what she'd say if she--knew,” he muttered. “But she sha'n't\nknow--till she just has to,” he vowed suddenly, under his breath,\nstriding into the hall for his hat and coat.\n\nNever had the Strata known such a Christmas as this was planned to be.\nCyril, Marie, and the twins were to be there, also Kate, her husband\nand three children, Paul, Egbert, and little Kate, from the West. On\nChristmas Day there was to be a big family dinner, with Aunt Hannah down\nfrom the Annex. Then, in concession to the extreme youth of the young\nhost and his twin cousins, there was to be an afternoon tree. The shades\nwere to be drawn and the candles lighted, however, so that there might\nbe no loss of effect. In the evening the tree was to be once more loaded\nwith fascinating packages and candy-bags, and this time the Greggorys,\nTommy Dunn, and all the rest from the Annex were to have the fun all\nover again.\n\nFrom garret to basement the Strata was aflame with holly, and aglitter\nwith tinsel. Nowhere did there seem to be a spot that did not have its\nbit of tissue paper or its trail of red ribbon. And everything--holly,\nribbon, tissue, and tinsel--led to the mysteriously closed doors of the\ngreat front drawing-room, past which none but Billy and her accredited\nmessengers might venture. No wonder, indeed, that even Baby scented\nexcitement, and that Baby's mother was not exactly calm. No wonder, too,\nthat Bertram, with his helpless right arm, and his heavy heart, felt\npeculiarly forlorn and “out of it.” No wonder, also, that he took\nhimself literally out of it with growing frequency.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hartwell and little Kate were to stay at the Strata. The\nboys, Paul and Egbert, were to go to Cyril's. Promptly at the appointed\ntime, two days before Christmas, they arrived. And from that hour until\ntwo days after Christmas, when the last bit of holly, ribbon, tissue,\nand tinsel disappeared from the floor, Billy moved in a whirl of anxious\nresponsibility that was yet filled with fun, frolic, and laughter.\n\nIt was a great success, the whole affair. Everybody seemed pleased and\nhappy--that is, everybody but Bertram; and he very plainly tried to seem\npleased and happy. Even Cyril unbent to the extent of not appearing to\nmind the noise one bit; and Sister Kate (Bertram said) found only\nthe extraordinarily small number of four details to change in the\narrangements. Baby obligingly let his teeth-getting go, for the\noccasion, and he and the twins, Franz and Felix, were the admiration and\ndelight of all. Little Kate, to be sure, was a trifle disconcerting once\nor twice, but everybody was too absorbed to pay much attention to her.\nBilly did, however, remember her opening remarks.\n\n“Well, little Kate, do you remember me?” Billy had greeted her\npleasantly.\n\n“Oh, yes,” little Kate had answered, with a winning smile. “You're my\nAunt Billy what married my Uncle Bertram instead of Uncle William as you\nsaid you would first.”\n\nEverybody laughed, and Billy colored, of course; but little Kate went on\neagerly:\n\n“And I've been wanting just awfully to see you,” she announced.\n\n“Have you? I'm glad, I'm sure. I feel highly flattered,” smiled Billy.\n\n“Well, I have. You see, I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever\nwished that you _had_ married Uncle William instead of Uncle Bertram, or\nthat you'd tried for Uncle Cyril before Aunty Marie got him?”\n\n“Kate!” gasped her horrified mother. “I told you--You see,” she broke\noff, turning to Billy despairingly. “She's been pestering me with\nquestions like that ever since she knew she was coming. She never has\nforgotten the way you changed from one uncle to the other. You may\nremember; it made a great impression on her at the time.”\n\n“Yes, I--I remember,” stammered Billy, trying to laugh off her\nembarrassment.\n\n“But you haven't told me yet whether you did wish you'd married Uncle\nWilliam, or Uncle Cyril,” interposed little Kate, persistently.\n\n“No, no, of course not!” exclaimed Billy, with a vivid blush, casting\nher eyes about for a door of escape, and rejoicing greatly when she\nspied Delia with the baby coming toward them. “There, look, my dear,\nhere's your new cousin, little Bertram!” she exclaimed. “Don't you want\nto see him?”\n\nLittle Kate turned dutifully.\n\n“Yes'm, Aunt Billy, but I'd rather see the twins. Mother says _they're_\nreal pretty and cunning.”\n\n“Er--y-yes, they are,” murmured Billy, on whom the emphasis of the\n“they're” had not been lost.\n\nNaturally, as may be supposed, therefore, Billy had not forgotten little\nKate's opening remarks.\n\nImmediately after Christmas Mr. Hartwell and the boys went back to their\nWestern home, leaving Mrs. Hartwell and her daughter to make a round of\nvisits to friends in the East. For almost a week after Christmas they\nremained at the Strata; and it was on the last day of their stay that\nlittle Kate asked the question that proved so momentous in results.\n\nBilly, almost unconsciously, had avoided tête-á-têtes with her\nsmall guest. But to-day they were alone together.\n\n“Aunt Billy,” began the little girl, after a meditative gaze into the\nother's face, “you _are_ married to Uncle Bertram, aren't you?”\n\n“I certainly am, my dear,” smiled Billy, trying to speak unconcernedly.\n\n“Well, then, what makes you forget it?”\n\n“What makes me forget--Why, child, what a question! What do you mean? I\ndon't forget it!” exclaimed Billy, indignantly.\n\n“Then what _did_ mother mean? I heard her tell Uncle William myself--she\ndidn't know I heard, though--that she did wish you'd remember you were\nUncle Bertram's wife as well as Cousin Bertram's mother.”\n\nBilly flushed scarlet, then grew very white. At that moment Mrs.\nHartwell came into the room. Little Kate turned triumphantly.\n\n“There, she hasn't forgotten, and I knew she hadn't, mother! I asked her\njust now, and she said she hadn't.”\n\n“Hadn't what?” questioned Mrs. Hartwell, looking a little apprehensively\nat her sister-in-law's white face and angry eyes.\n\n“Hadn't forgotten that she was Uncle Bertram's wife.”\n\n“Kate,” interposed Billy, steadily meeting her sister-in-law's gaze,\n“will you be good enough to tell me what this child is talking about?”\n\nMrs. Hartwell sighed, and gave an impatient gesture.\n\n“Kate, I've a mind to take you home on the next train,” she said to her\ndaughter. “Run away, now, down-stairs. Your Aunt Billy and I want to\ntalk. Come, come, hurry! I mean what I say,” she added warningly, as she\nsaw unmistakable signs of rebellion on the small young face.\n\n“I wish,” pouted little Kate, rising reluctantly, and moving toward the\ndoor, “that you didn't always send me away just when I wanted most to\nstay!”\n\n“Well, Kate?” prompted Billy, as the door closed behind the little girl.\n\n“Yes, I suppose I'll have to say it now, as long as that child has put\nher finger in the pie. But I hadn't intended to speak, no matter what I\nsaw. I promised myself I wouldn't, before I came. I know, of course, how\nBertram and Cyril, and William, too, say that I'm always interfering\nin affairs that don't concern me--though, for that matter, if my own\nbrother's affairs don't concern me, I don't know whose should!\n\n“But, as I said, I wasn't going to speak this time, no matter what I\nsaw. And I haven't--except to William, and Cyril, and Aunt Hannah; but\nI suppose somewhere little Kate got hold of it. It's simply this, Billy.\nIt seems to me it's high time you began to realize that you're Bertram's\nwife as well as the baby's mother.”\n\n“That, I am--I don't think I quite understand,” said Billy, unsteadily.\n\n“No, I suppose you don't,” sighed Kate, “though where your eyes are, I\ndon't see--or, rather, I do see: they're on the baby, _always_. It's all\nvery well and lovely, Billy, to be a devoted mother, and you certainly\nare that. I'll say that much for you, and I'll admit I never thought you\nwould be. But _can't_ you see what you're doing to Bertram?”\n\n“_Doing to Bertram!_--by being a devoted mother to his son!”\n\n“Yes, doing to Bertram. Can't you see what a change there is in the\nboy? He doesn't act like himself at all. He's restless and gloomy and\nentirely out of sorts.”\n\n“Yes, I know; but that's his arm,” pleaded Billy. “Poor boy--he's so\ntired of it!”\n\nKate shook her head decisively.\n\n“It's more than his arm, Billy. You'd see it yourself if you weren't\nblinded by your absorption in that baby. Where is Bertram every evening?\nWhere is he daytimes? Do you realize that he's been at home scarcely one\nevening since I came? And as for the days--he's almost never here.”\n\n“But, Kate, he can't paint now, you know, so of course he doesn't\nneed to stay so closely at home,” defended Billy. “He goes out to find\ndistraction from himself.”\n\n“Yes, 'distraction,' indeed,” sniffed Kate. “And where do you suppose\nhe finds it? Do you _know_ where he finds it? I tell you, Billy, Bertram\nHenshaw is not the sort of man that should find too much 'distraction'\noutside his home. His tastes and his temperament are altogether too\nBohemian, and--”\n\nBilly interrupted with a peremptorily upraised hand.\n\n“Please remember, Kate, you are speaking of my husband to his wife; and\nhis wife has perfect confidence in him, and is just a little particular\nas to what you say.”\n\n“Yes; well, I'm speaking of my brother, too, whom I know very well,”\n shrugged Kate. “All is, you may remember sometime that I warned\nyou--that's all. This trusting business is all very pretty; but I think\n'twould be a lot prettier, and a vast deal more sensible, if you'd give\nhim a little attention as well as trust, and see if you can't keep him\nat home a bit more. At least you'll know whom he's with, then. Cyril\nsays he saw him last week with Bob Seaver.”\n\n“With--Bob--Seaver?” faltered Billy, changing color.\n\n“Yes. I see you remember him,” smiled Kate, not quite agreeably.\n“Perhaps now you'll take some stock in what I've said, and remember it.”\n\n“I'll remember it, certainly,” returned Billy, a little proudly. “You've\nsaid a good many things to me, in the past, Mrs. Hartwell, and I've\nremembered them all--every one.”\n\nIt was Kate's turn to flush, and she did it.\n\n“Yes, I know. And I presume very likely sometimes there _hasn't_ been\nmuch foundation for what I've said. I think this time, however, you'll\nfind there is,” she finished, with an air of hurt dignity.\n\nBilly made no reply, perhaps because Delia, at that moment, brought in\nthe baby.\n\nMrs. Hartwell and little Kate left the Strata the next morning. Until\nthen Billy contrived to keep, before them, a countenance serene, and a\nmanner free from unrest. Even when, after dinner that evening, Bertram\nput on his hat and coat and went out, Billy refused to meet her\nsister-in-law's meaning gaze. But in the morning, after they had left\nthe house, Billy did not attempt to deceive herself. Determinedly, then,\nshe set herself to going over in her mind the past months since the baby\ncame; and she was appalled at what she found. Ever in her ears, too, was\nthat feared name, “Bob Seaver”; and ever before her eyes was that night\nyears ago when, as an eighteen-year-old girl, she had followed Bertram\nand Bob Seaver into a glittering café at eleven o'clock at night,\nbecause Bertram had been drinking and was not himself. She remembered\nBertram's face when he had seen her, and what he had said when she\nbegged him to come home. She remembered, too, what the family had said\nafterward. But she remembered, also, that years later Bertram had told\nher what that escapade of hers had really done for him, and that he\nbelieved he had actually loved her from that moment. After that night,\nat all events, he had had little to do with Bob Seaver.\n\nAnd now Seaver was back again, it seemed--and with Bertram. They had\nbeen seen together. But if they had, what could she do? Surely she could\nhardly now follow them into a public café and demand that Seaver let\nher husband come home! But she could keep him at home, perhaps. (Billy\nquite brightened at this thought.) Kate had said that she was so\nabsorbed in Baby that her husband received no attention at all. Billy\ndid not believe this was true; but if it were true, she could at least\nrectify that mistake. If it were attention that he wanted--he should\nwant no more. Poor Bertram! No wonder that he had sought distraction\noutside! When one had a horrid broken arm that would not let one do\nanything, what else could one do?\n\nJust here Billy suddenly remembered the book, “A Talk to Young Wives.”\n If she recollected rightly, there was a chapter that covered the very\nclaim Kate had been making. Billy had not thought of the book for\nmonths, but she went at once to get it now. There might be, after all,\nsomething in it that would help her.\n\n“The Coming of the First Baby.” Billy found the chapter without\ndifficulty and settled herself to read, her countenance alight with\ninterest. In a surprisingly short time, however, a new expression came\nto her face; and at last a little gasp of dismay fell from her lips. She\nlooked up then, with a startled gaze.\n\n_Had_ her walls possessed eyes and ears all these past months, only to\ngive instructions to an unseen hand that it might write what the eyes\nand ears had learned? For it was such sentences as these that the\nconscience-smitten Billy read:\n\n“Maternity is apt to work a miracle in a woman's life, but sometimes it\nspells disaster so far as domestic bliss is concerned. The young mother,\nwrapped up in the delights and duties of motherhood, utterly forgets\nthat she has a husband. She lives and moves and has her being in the\nnursery. She thinks baby, talks baby, knows only baby. She refuses to\ndress up, because it is easier to take care of baby in a frowzy wrapper.\nShe will not go out with her husband for fear something might happen to\nthe baby. She gives up her music because baby won't let her practice.\nIn vain her husband tries to interest her in his own affairs. She has\nneither eyes nor ears for him, only for baby.\n\n“Now no man enjoys having his nose put out of joint, even by his own\nchild. He loves his child devotedly, and is proud of him, of course;\nbut that does not keep him from wanting the society of his wife\noccasionally, nor from longing for her old-time love and sympathetic\ninterest. It is an admirable thing, certainly, for a woman to be a\ndevoted mother; but maternal affection can be carried too far. Husbands\nhave some rights as well as offspring; and the wife who neglects\nher husband for her babies does so at her peril. Home, with the wife\neternally in the nursery, is apt to be a dull and lonely thing to the\naverage husband, so he starts out to find amusement for himself--and he\nfinds it. Then is the time when the new little life that is so precious,\nand that should have bound the two more closely together, becomes the\nwedge that drives them apart.”\n\nBilly did not read any more. With a little sobbing cry she flung the\nbook back into her desk, and began to pull off her wrapper. Her fingers\nshook. Already she saw herself a Monster, a Wicked Destroyer of Domestic\nBliss with her thoughtless absorption in Baby, until he had become that\nAwful Thing--a _Wedge_. And Bertram--poor Bertram, with his broken arm!\nShe had not played to him, nor sung to him, nor gone out with him. And\nwhen had they had one of their good long talks about Bertram's work and\nplans?\n\nBut it should all be changed now. She would play, and sing, and go out\nwith him. She would dress up, too. He should see no more wrappers. She\nwould ask about his work, and seem interested. She _was_ interested. She\nremembered now, that just before he was hurt, he had told her of a\nnew portrait, and of a new “Face of a Girl” that he had planned to do.\nLately he had said nothing about these. He had seemed discouraged--and\nno wonder, with his broken arm! But she would change all that. He should\nsee! And forthwith Billy hurried to her closet to pick out her prettiest\nhouse frock.\n\nLong before dinner Billy was ready, waiting in the drawing-room. She had\non a pretty little blue silk gown that she knew Bertram liked, and she\nwatched very anxiously for Bertram to come up the steps. She remembered\nnow, with a pang, that he had long since given up his peculiar ring; but\nshe meant to meet him at the door just the same.\n\nBertram, however, did not come. At a quarter before six he telephoned\nthat he had met some friends, and would dine at the club.\n\n“My, my, how pretty we are!” exclaimed Uncle William, when they went\ndown to dinner together. “New frock?”\n\n“Why, no, Uncle William,” laughed Billy, a little tremulously. “You've\nseen it dozens of times!”\n\n“Have I?” murmured the man. “I don't seem to remember it. Too bad\nBertram isn't here to see you. Somehow, you look unusually pretty\nto-night.”\n\nAnd Billy's heart ached anew.\n\nBilly spent the evening practicing--softly, to be sure, so as not to\nwake Baby--but _practicing_.\n\nAs the days passed Billy discovered that it was much easier to say she\nwould “change things” than it was really to change them. She changed\nherself, it is true--her clothes, her habits, her words, and her\nthoughts; but it was more difficult to change Bertram. In the first\nplace, he was there so little. She was dismayed when she saw how very\nlittle, indeed, he was at home--and she did not like to ask him outright\nto stay. That was not in accordance with her plans. Besides, the “Talk\nto Young Wives” said that indirect influence was much to be preferred,\nalways, to direct persuasion--which last, indeed, usually failed to\nproduce results.\n\nSo Billy “dressed up,” and practiced, and talked (of anything but the\nbaby), and even hinted shamelessly once or twice that she would like to\ngo to the theater; but all to little avail. True, Bertram brightened\nup, for a minute, when he came home and found her in a new or a favorite\ndress, and he told her how pretty she looked. He appeared to like to\nhave her play to him, too, even declaring once or twice that it was\nquite like old times, yes, it was. But he never noticed her hints about\nthe theater, and he did not seem to like to talk about his work, even a\nlittle bit.\n\nBilly laid this last fact to his injured arm. She decided that he had\nbecome blue and discouraged, and that he needed cheering up, especially\nabout his work; so she determinedly and systematically set herself to\ndoing it.\n\nShe talked of the fine work he had done, and of the still finer work he\nwould yet do, when his arm was well. She told him how proud she was of\nhim, and she let him see how dear his Art was to her, and how badly she\nwould feel if she thought he had really lost all his interest in his\nwork and would never paint again. She questioned him about the new\nportrait he was to begin as soon as his arm would let him; and she tried\nto arouse his enthusiasm in the picture he had planned to show in the\nMarch Exhibition of the Bohemian Ten, telling him that she was sure his\narm would allow him to complete at least one canvas to hang.\n\nIn none of this, however, did Bertram appear in the least interested.\nThe one thing, indeed, which he seemed not to want to talk about, was\nhis work; and he responded to her overtures on the subject with only\nmoody silence, or else with almost irritable monosyllables; all of which\nnot only grieved but surprised Billy very much. For, according to\nthe “Talk to Young Wives,” she was doing exactly what the ideal,\nsympathetic, interested-in-her-husband's-work wife should do.\n\nWhen February came, bringing with it no change for the better, Billy was\nthoroughly frightened. Bertram's arm plainly was not improving. He was\nmore gloomy and restless than ever. He seemed not to want to stay at\nhome at all; and Billy knew now for a certainty that he was spending\nmore and more time with Bob Seaver and “the boys.”\n\nPoor Billy! Nowhere could she look these days and see happiness. Even\nthe adored baby seemed, at times, almost to give an added pang. Had he\nnot become, according to the “Talk to Young Wives” that awful thing, a\n_Wedge_? The Annex, too, carried its sting; for where was the need of\nan overflow house for happiness now, when there was no happiness to\noverflow? Even the little jade idol on Billy's mantel Billy could not\nbear to see these days, for its once bland smile had become a hideous\ngrin, demanding, “Where, now, is your heap plenty velly good luckee?”\n\nBut, before Bertram, Billy still carried a bravely smiling face, and to\nhim still she talked earnestly and enthusiastically of his work--which\nlast, as it happened, was the worst course she could have pursued; for\nthe one thing poor Bertram wished to forget, just now, was--his work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. CONSPIRATORS\n\n\nEarly in February came Arkwright's appearance at the Boston Opera\nHouse--the first since he had sung there as a student a few years\nbefore. He was an immediate and an unquestioned success. His portrait\nadorned the front page of almost every Boston newspaper the next\nmorning, and captious critics vied with each other to do him honor. His\nfull history, from boyhood up, was featured, with special emphasis on\nhis recent triumphs in New York and foreign capitals. He was interviewed\nas to his opinion on everything from vegetarianism to woman's suffrage;\nand his preferences as to pies and pastimes were given headline\nprominence. There was no doubt of it. Mr. M. J. Arkwright was a star.\n\nAll Arkwright's old friends, including Billy, Bertram, Cyril, Marie,\nCalderwell, Alice Greggory, Aunt Hannah, and Tommy Dunn, went to hear\nhim sing; and after the performance he held a miniature reception,\nwith enough adulation to turn his head completely around, he declared\ndeprecatingly. Not until the next evening, however, did he have an\nopportunity for what he called a real talk with any of his friends;\nthen, in Calderwell's room, he settled back in his chair with a sigh of\ncontent.\n\nFor a time his own and Calderwell's affairs occupied their attention;\nthen, after a short pause, the tenor asked abruptly:\n\n“Is there anything--wrong with the Henshaws, Calderwell?”\n\nCalderwell came suddenly erect in his chair.\n\n“Thank you! I hoped you'd introduce that subject; though, for that\nmatter, if you hadn't, I should. Yes, there is--and I'm looking to you,\nold man, to get them out of it.”\n\n“I?” Arkwright sat erect now.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“In a way, the expected has happened--though I know now that I didn't\nreally expect it to happen, in spite of my prophecies. You may remember\nI was always skeptical on the subject of Bertram's settling down to a\ndomestic hearthstone. I insisted 'twould be the turn of a girl's head\nand the curve of her cheek that he wanted to paint.”\n\nArkwright looked up with a quick frown.\n\n“You don't mean that Henshaw has been cad enough to find another--”\n\nCalderwell threw up his hand.\n\n“No, no, not that! We haven't that to deal with--yet, thank goodness!\nThere's no woman in it. And, really, when you come right down to it, if\never a fellow had an excuse to seek diversion, Bertram Henshaw has--poor\nchap! It's just this. Bertram broke his arm again last October.”\n\n“Yes, so I hear, and I thought he was looking badly.”\n\n“He is. It's a bad business. 'Twas improperly set in the first place,\nand it's not doing well now. In fact, I'm told on pretty good authority\nthat the doctor says he probably will never use it again.”\n\n“Oh, by George! Calderwell!”\n\n“Yes. Tough, isn't it? 'Specially when you think of his work, and\nknow--as I happen to--that he's particularly dependent on his right hand\nfor everything. He doesn't tell this generally, and I understand Billy\nand the family know nothing of it--how hopeless the case is, I mean.\nWell, naturally, the poor fellow has been pretty thoroughly discouraged,\nand to get away from himself he's gone back to his old Bohemian habits,\nspending much of his time with some of his old cronies that are none too\ngood for him--Seaver, for instance.”\n\n“Bob Seaver? Yes, I know him.” Arkwright's lips snapped together\ncrisply.\n\n“Yes. He said he knew you. That's why I'm counting on your help.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean I want you to get Henshaw away from him, and keep him away.”\n\nArkwright's face darkened with an angry flush.\n\n“Great Scott, Calderwell! What are you talking about? Henshaw is no kid\nto be toted home, and I'm no nursery governess to do the toting!”\n\nCalderwell laughed quietly.\n\n“No; I don't think any one would take you for a nursery governess,\nArkwright, in spite of the fact that you are still known to some of\nyour friends as 'Mary Jane.' But you can sing a song, man, which will\npromptly give you a through ticket to their innermost sacred circle.\nIn fact, to my certain knowledge, Seaver is already planning a jamboree\nwith you at the right hand of the toastmaster. There's your chance. Once\nin, stay in--long enough to get Henshaw out.”\n\n“But, good heavens, Calderwell, it's impossible! What can I do?”\n demanded Arkwright, savagely. “I can't walk up to the man, take him by\nthe ear, and say: 'Here, you, sir--march home!' Neither can I come\nthe 'I-am-holier-than-thou' act, and hold up to him the mirror of his\ntransgressions.”\n\n“No, but you can get him out of it _some_ way. You can find a way--for\nBilly's sake.”\n\nThere was no answer, and, after a moment, Calderwell went on more\nquietly.\n\n“I haven't seen Billy but two or three times since I came back to\nBoston--but I don't need to, to know that she's breaking her heart over\nsomething. And of course that something is--Bertram.”\n\nThere was still no answer. Arkwright got up suddenly, and walked to the\nwindow.\n\n“You see, I'm helpless,” resumed Calderwell. “I don't paint pictures,\nnor sing songs, nor write stories, nor dance jigs for a living--and you\nhave to do one or another to be in with that set. And it's got to be a\nJohnny-on-the-spot with Bertram. All is, something will have to be done\nto get him out of the state of mind and body he's in now, or--”\n\nArkwright wheeled sharply.\n\n“When did you say this jamboree was going to be?” he demanded.\n\n“Next week, some time. The date is not settled. They were going to\nconsult you.”\n\n“Hm-m,” commented Arkwright. And, though his next remark was a complete\nchange of subject, Calderwell gave a contented sigh.\n\n\nIf, when the proposition was first made to him, Arkwright was doubtful\nof his ability to be a successful “Johnny-on-the-spot,” he was even more\ndoubtful of it as the days passed, and he was attempting to carry out\nthe suggestion.\n\nHe had known that he was undertaking a most difficult and delicate task,\nand he soon began to fear that it was an impossible one, as well. With\na dogged persistence, however, he adhered to his purpose, ever on the\nalert to be more watchful, more tactful, more efficient in emergencies.\n\nDisagreeable as was the task, in a way, in another way it was a great\npleasure to him. He was glad of the opportunity to do anything for\nBilly; and then, too, he was glad of something absorbing enough to take\nhis mind off his own affairs. He told himself, sometimes, that this\nhelping another man to fight his tiger skin was assisting himself to\nfight his own.\n\nArkwright was trying very hard not to think of Alice Greggory these\ndays. He had come back hoping that he was in a measure “cured” of his\n“folly,” as he termed it; but the first look into Alice Greggory's\nblue-gray eyes had taught him the fallacy of that idea. In that very\nfirst meeting with Alice, he feared that he had revealed his secret, for\nshe was plainly so nervously distant and ill at ease with him that he\ncould but construe her embarrassment and chilly dignity as pity for him\nand a desire to show him that she had nothing but friendship for him.\nSince then he had seen but little of her, partly because he did not wish\nto see her, and partly because his time was so fully occupied. Then,\ntoo, in a round-about way he had heard a rumor that Calderwell was\nengaged to be married; and, though no feminine name had been mentioned\nin connection with the story, Arkwright had not hesitated to supply in\nhis own mind that of Alice Greggory.\n\nBeginning with the “jamboree,” which came off quite in accordance with\nCalderwell's prophecies, Arkwright spent the most of such time as was\nnot given to his professional duties in deliberately cultivating the\nsociety of Bertram and his friends. To this extent he met with no\ndifficulty, for he found that M. J. Arkwright, the new star in the\noperatic firmament, was obviously a welcome comrade. Beyond this it was\nnot so easy. Arkwright wondered, indeed, sometimes, if he were making\nany progress at all. But still he persevered.\n\nHe walked with Bertram, he talked with Bertram, unobtrusively he\ncontrived to be near Bertram almost always, when they were together with\n“the boys.” Gradually he won from him the story of what the surgeon had\nsaid to him, and of how black the future looked in consequence. This\nestablished a new bond between them, so potent that Arkwright ventured\nto test it one day by telling Bertram the story of the tiger skin--the\nfirst tiger skin in his uncle's library years ago, and of how, since\nthen, any difficulty he had encountered he had tried to treat as a\ntiger skin. In telling the story he was careful to draw no moral for\nhis listener, and to preach no sermon. He told the tale, too, with all\npossible whimsical lightness of touch, and immediately at its conclusion\nhe changed the subject. But that he had not failed utterly in his design\nwas evidenced a few days later when Bertram grimly declared that he\nguessed _his_ tiger skin was a lively beast, all right.\n\nThe first time Arkwright went home with Bertram, his presence was almost\na necessity. Bertram was not quite himself that night. Billy admitted\nthem. She had plainly been watching and waiting. Arkwright never forgot\nthe look on her face as her eyes met his. There was a curious mixture\nof terror, hurt pride, relief, and shame, overtopped by a fierce loyalty\nwhich almost seemed to say aloud the words: “Don't you dare to blame\nhim!”\n\nArkwright's heart ached with sympathy and admiration at the proudly\ncourageous way in which Billy carried off the next few painful minutes.\nEven when he bade her good night a little later, only her eyes said\n“thank you.” Her lips were dumb.\n\nArkwright often went home with Bertram after that. Not that it was\nalways necessary--far from it. Some time, indeed, elapsed before he\nhad quite the same excuse again for his presence. But he had found that\noccasionally he could get Bertram home earlier by adroit suggestions of\none kind or another; and more and more frequently he was succeeding in\ngetting him home for a game of chess.\n\nBertram liked chess, and was a fine player. Since breaking his arm he\nhad turned to games with the feverish eagerness of one who looks for\nsomething absorbing to fill an unrestful mind. It was Seaver's skill\nin chess that had at first attracted Bertram to the man long ago; but\nBertram could beat him easily--too easily for much pleasure in it now.\nSo they did not play chess often these days. Bertram had found that, in\nspite of his injury, he could still take part in other games, and some\nof them, if not so intricate as chess, were at least more apt to take\nhis mind off himself, especially if there were a bit of money up to add\nzest and interest.\n\nAs it happened, however, Bertram learned one day that Arkwright could\nplay chess--and play well, too, as he discovered after their first\ngame together. This fact contributed not a little to such success as\nArkwright was having in his efforts to wean Bertram from his undesirable\ncompanions; for Bertram soon found out that Arkwright was more than a\nmatch for himself, and the occasional games he did succeed in winning\nonly whetted his appetite for more. Many an evening now, therefore, was\nspent by the two men in Bertram's den, with Billy anxiously hovering\nnear, her eyes longingly watching either her husband's absorbed face or\nthe pretty little red and white ivory figures, which seemed to possess\nso wonderful a power to hold his attention. In spite of her joy at the\nchessmen's efficacy in keeping Bertram at home, however, she was almost\njealous of them.\n\n“Mr. Arkwright, couldn't you show _me_ how to play, sometime?” she said\nwistfully, one evening, when the momentary absence of Bertram had left\nthe two alone together. “I used to watch Bertram and Marie play years\nago; but I never knew how to play myself. Not that I can see where the\nfun is in just sitting staring at a chessboard for half an hour at a\ntime, though! But Bertram likes it, and so I--I want to learn to stare\nwith him. Will you teach me?”\n\n“I should be glad to,” smiled Arkwright.\n\n“Then will you come, maybe, sometimes when Bertram is at the doctor's?\nHe goes every Tuesday and Friday at three o'clock for treatment. I'd\nrather you came then for two reasons: first, because I don't want\nBertram to know I'm learning, till I can play _some_; and, secondly,\nbecause--because I don't want to take you away--from him.”\n\nThe last words were spoken very low, and were accompanied by a painful\nblush. It was the first time Billy had ever hinted to Arkwright, in\nwords, that she understood what he was trying to do.\n\n“I'll come next Tuesday,” promised Arkwright, with a cheerfully\nunobservant air. Then Bertram came in, bringing the book of Chess\nProblems, for which he had gone up-stairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. CHESS\n\n\nPromptly at three o'clock Tuesday afternoon Arkwright appeared at the\nStrata, and for the next hour Billy did her best to learn the names and\nthe moves of the pretty little ivory men. But at the end of the hour she\nwas almost ready to give up in despair.\n\n“If there weren't so many kinds, and if they didn't all insist on doing\nsomething different, it wouldn't be so bad,” she sighed. “But how can\nyou be expected to remember which goes diagonal, and which crisscross,\nand which can't go but one square, and which can skip 'way across the\nboard, 'specially when that little pawn-thing can go straight ahead\n_two_ squares sometimes, and the next minute only one (except when\nit takes things, and then it goes crooked one square) and when that\ntiresome little horse tries to go all ways at once, and can jump 'round\nand hurdle over _anybody's_ head, even the king's--how can you expect\nfolks to remember? But, then, Bertram remembers,” she added, resolutely,\n“so I guess I can.”\n\nWhenever possible, after that, Arkwright came on Tuesdays and Fridays,\nand, in spite of her doubts, Billy did very soon begin to “remember.”\n Spurred by her great desire to play with Bertram and surprise him, Billy\nspared no pains to learn well her lessons. Even among the baby's books\nand playthings these days might be found a “Manual of Chess,” for Billy\npursued her study at all hours; and some nights even her dreams were of\nruined, castles where kings and queens and bishops disported themselves,\nwith pawns for servants, and where a weird knight on horseback used the\ncastle's highest tower for a hurdle, landing always a hundred yards to\none side of where he would be expected to come down.\n\nIt was not long, of course, before Billy could play a game of chess,\nafter a fashion, but she knew just enough to realize that she actually\nknew nothing; and she knew, too, that until she could play a really good\ngame, her moves would not hold Bertram's attention for one minute. Not\nat present, therefore, was she willing Bertram should know what she was\nattempting to do.\n\nBilly had not yet learned what the great surgeon had said to Bertram.\nShe knew only that his arm was no better, and that he never voluntarily\nspoke of his painting. Over her now seemed to be hanging a vague horror.\nSomething was the matter. She knew that. But what it was she could\nnot fathom. She realized that Arkwright was trying to help, and her\ngratitude, though silent, knew no bounds. Not even to Aunt Hannah or\nUncle William could she speak of this thing that was troubling her. That\nthey, too, understood, in a measure, she realized. But still she said no\nword. Billy was wearing a proud little air of aloofness these days that\nwas heart-breaking to those who saw it and read it aright for what it\nwas: loyalty to Bertram, no matter what happened. And so Billy pored\nover her chessboard feverishly, tirelessly, having ever before her\nlonging eyes the dear time when Bertram, across the table from her,\nshould sit happily staring for half an hour at a move she had made.\n\nWhatever Billy's chess-playing was to signify, however, in her own life,\nit was destined to play a part in the lives of two friends of hers that\nwas most unexpected.\n\nDuring Billy's very first lesson, as it chanced, Alice Greggory called\nand found Billy and Arkwright so absorbed in their game that they did\nnot at first hear Eliza speak her name.\n\nThe quick color that flew to Arkwright's face at sight of herself was\nconstrued at once by Alice as embarrassment on his part at being found\ntête-á-tête with Bertram Henshaw's wife. And she did not like\nit. She was not pleased that he was there. She was less pleased that he\nblushed for being there.\n\nIt so happened that Alice found him there again several times. Alice\ngave a piano lesson at two o'clock every Tuesday and Friday afternoon to\na little Beacon Street neighbor of Billy's, and she had fallen into the\nhabit of stepping in to see Billy for a few minutes afterward, which\nbrought her there at a little past three, just after the chess lesson\nwas well started.\n\nIf, the first time that Alice Greggory found Arkwright opposite Billy at\nthe chess-table, she was surprised and displeased, the second and third\ntimes she was much more so. When it finally came to her one day with\nsickening illumination, that always the tête-á-têtes were\nduring Bertram's hour at the doctor's, she was appalled.\n\nWhat could it mean? Had Arkwright given up his fight? Was he playing\nfalse to himself and to Bertram by trying thus, on the sly, to win the\nlove of his friend's wife? Was this man, whom she had so admired for his\nbrave stand, and to whom all unasked she had given her heart's best\nlove (more the pity of it!)--was this idol of hers to show feet of clay,\nafter all? She could not believe it. And yet--\n\nSick at heart, but imbued with the determination of a righteous cause,\nAlice Greggory resolved, for Billy's sake, to watch and wait. If\nnecessary she should speak to some one--though to whom she did not know.\nBilly's happiness should not be put in jeopardy if she could help it.\nIndeed, no!\n\nAs the weeks passed, Alice came to be more and more uneasy, distressed,\nand grieved. Of Billy she could believe no evil; but of Arkwright\nshe was beginning to think she could believe everything that was\ndishonorable and despicable. And to believe that of the man she still\nloved--no wonder that Alice did not look nor act like herself these\ndays.\n\nIncensed at herself because she did love him, angry at him because he\nseemed to be proving himself so unworthy of that love, and genuinely\nfrightened at what she thought was the fast-approaching wreck of all\nhappiness for her dear friend, Billy, Alice did not know which way\nto turn. At the first she had told herself confidently that she would\n“speak to somebody.” But, as time passed, she saw the impracticability\nof that idea. Speak to somebody, indeed! To whom? When? Where? What\nshould she say? Where was her right to say anything? She was not dealing\nwith a parcel of naughty children who had pilfered the cake jar! She\nwas dealing with grown men and women, who, presumedly, knew their own\naffairs, and who, certainly, would resent any interference from her. On\nthe other hand, could she stand calmly by and see Bertram lose his wife,\nArkwright his honor, Billy her happiness, and herself her faith in human\nnature, all because to do otherwise would be to meddle in other people's\nbusiness? Apparently she could, and should. At least that seemed to be\nthe rôle which she was expected to play.\n\nIt was when Alice had reached this unhappy frame of mind that Arkwright\nhimself unexpectedly opened the door for her.\n\nThe two were alone together in Bertram Henshaw's den. It was Tuesday\nafternoon. Alice had called to find Billy and Arkwright deep in their\nusual game of chess. Then a matter of domestic affairs had taken Billy\nfrom the room.\n\n“I'm afraid I'll have to be gone ten minutes, or more,” she had said, as\nshe rose from the table reluctantly. “But you might be showing Alice the\nmoves, Mr. Arkwright,” she had added, with a laugh, as she disappeared.\n\n“Shall I teach you the moves?” he had smiled, when they were alone\ntogether.\n\nAlice's reply had been so indignantly short and sharp that Arkwright,\nafter a moment's pause, had said, with a whimsical smile that yet\ncarried a touch of sadness:\n\n“I am forced to surmise from your answer that you think it is _you_ who\nshould be teaching _me_ moves. At all events, I seem to have been making\nsome moves lately that have not suited you, judging by your actions.\nHave I offended you in any way, Alice?”\n\nThe girl turned with a quick lifting of her head. Alice knew that if\never she were to speak, it must be now. Never again could she hope for\nsuch an opportunity as this. Suddenly throwing circumspect caution quite\naside, she determined that she would speak. Springing to her feet she\ncrossed the room and seated herself in Billy's chair at the chess-table.\n\n“Me! Offend me!” she exclaimed, in a low voice. “As if I were the one\nyou were offending!”\n\n“Why, _Alice!_” murmured the man, in obvious stupefaction.\n\nAlice raised her hand, palm outward.\n\n“Now don't, _please_ don't pretend you don't know,” she begged, almost\npiteously. “Please don't add that to all the rest. Oh, I understand,\nof course, it's none of my affairs, and I wasn't going to speak,” she\nchoked; “but, to-day, when you gave me this chance, I had to. At first\nI couldn't believe it,” she plunged on, plainly hurrying against Billy's\nreturn. “After all you'd told me of how you meant to fight it--your\ntiger skin. And I thought it merely _happened_ that you were here alone\nwith her those days I came. Then, when I found out they were _always_\nthe days Mr. Henshaw was away at the doctor's, I had to believe.”\n\nShe stopped for breath. Arkwright, who, up to this moment had shown that\nhe was completely mystified as to what she was talking about, suddenly\nflushed a painful red. He was obviously about to speak, but she\nprevented him with a quick gesture.\n\n“There's a little more I've got to say, please. As if it weren't bad\nenough to do what you're doing _at all_, but you must needs take it at\nsuch a time as this when--when her husband _isn't_ doing just what he\nought to do, and we all know it--it's so unfair to take her now, and\ntry to--to win--And you aren't even fair with him,” she protested\ntremulously. “You pretend to be his friend. You go with him everywhere.\nIt's just as if you were _helping_ to--to pull him down. You're one with\nthe whole bunch.” (The blood suddenly receded from Arkwright's\nface, leaving it very white; but if Alice saw it, she paid no heed.)\n“Everybody says you are. Then to come here like this, on the sly, when\nyou know he can't be here, I--Oh, can't you see what you're doing?”\n\nThere was a moment's pause, then Arkwright spoke. A deep pain looked\nfrom his eyes. He was still very pale, and his mouth had settled into\nsad lines.\n\n“I think, perhaps, it may be just as well if I tell you what I _am_\ndoing--or, rather, trying to do,” he said quietly.\n\nThen he told her.\n\n“And so you see,” he added, when he had finished the tale, “I haven't\nreally accomplished much, after all, and it seems the little I have\naccomplished has only led to my being misjudged by you, my best friend.”\n\nAlice gave a sobbing cry. Her face was scarlet. Horror, shame, and\nrelief struggled for mastery in her countenance.\n\n“Oh, but I didn't know, I didn't know,” she moaned, twisting her hands\nnervously. “And now, when you've been so brave, so true--for me to\naccuse you of--Oh, can you _ever_ forgive me? But you see, knowing that\nyou _did_ care for her, it did look--” She choked into silence, and\nturned away her head.\n\nHe glanced at her tenderly, mournfully.\n\n“Yes,” he said, after a minute, in a low voice. “I can see how it did\nlook; and so I'm going to tell you now something I had meant never to\ntell you. There really couldn't have been anything in that, you see,\nfor I found out long ago that it was gone--whatever love there had been\nfor--Billy.”\n\n“But your--tiger skin!”\n\n“Oh, yes, I thought it was alive,” smiled Arkwright, sadly, “when I\nasked you to help me fight it. But one day, very suddenly, I discovered\nthat it was nothing but a dead skin of dreams and memories. But I made\nanother discovery, too. I found that just beyond lay another one, and\nthat was very much alive.”\n\n“Another one?” Alice turned to him in wonder. “But you never asked me to\nhelp you fight--that one!”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“No; I couldn't, you see. You couldn't have helped me. You'd only have\nhindered me.”\n\n“Hindered you?”\n\n“Yes. You see, it was my love for--you, that I was fighting--then.”\n\nAlice gave a low cry and flushed vividly; but Arkwright hurried on, his\neyes turned away.\n\n“Oh, I understand. I know. I'm not asking for--anything. I heard some\ntime ago of your engagement to Calderwell. I've tried many times to\nsay the proper, expected pretty speeches, but--I couldn't. I will\nnow, though. I do. You have all my tenderest best wishes for your\nhappiness--dear. If long ago I hadn't been such a blind fool as not to\nknow my own heart--”\n\n“But--but there's some mistake,” interposed Alice, palpitatingly, with\nhanging head. “I--I'm not engaged to Mr. Calderwell.”\n\nArkwright turned and sent a keen glance into her face.\n\n“You're--not?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But I heard that Calderwell--” He stopped helplessly.\n\n“You heard that Mr. Calderwell was engaged, very likely. But--it so\nhappens he isn't engaged--to me,” murmured Alice, faintly.\n\n“But, long ago you said--” Arkwright paused, his eyes still keenly\nsearching her face.\n\n“Never mind what I said--long ago,” laughed Alice, trying unsuccessfully\nto meet his gaze. “One says lots of things, at times, you know.”\n\nInto Arkwright's eyes came a new light, a light that plainly needed but\na breath to fan it into quick fire.\n\n“Alice,” he said softly, “do you mean that maybe now--I needn't try to\nfight--that other tiger skin?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nArkwright reached out a pleading hand.\n\n“Alice, dear, I've loved you so long,” he begged unsteadily. “Don't\nyou think that sometime, if I was very, very patient, you could just\n_begin_--to care a little for me?”\n\nStill there was no answer. Then, slowly, Alice shook her head. Her face\nwas turned quite away--which was a pity, for if Arkwright could have\nseen the sudden tender mischief in her eyes, his own would not have\nbecome so somber.\n\n“Not even a little bit?”\n\n“I couldn't ever--begin,” answered a half-smothered voice.\n\n“Alice!” cried the man, heart-brokenly.\n\nAlice turned now, and for a fleeting instant let him see her eyes,\nglowing with the love so long kept in relentless exile.\n\n“I couldn't, because, you see-I began--long ago,” she whispered.\n\n“Alice!” It was the same single word, but spoken with a world of\ndifference, for into it now was crowded all the glory and the wonder of\na great love. “Alice!” breathed the man again; and this time the word\nwas, oh, so tenderly whispered into the little pink and white ear of the\ngirl in his arms.\n\n“I got delayed,” began Billy, in the doorway.\n\n“Oh-h!” she broke off, beating a hushed, but precipitate, retreat.\n\nFully thirty minutes later, Billy came to the door again. This time her\napproach was heralded by a snatch of song.\n\n“I hope you'll excuse my being gone so long,” she smiled, as she\nentered the room where her two guests sat decorously face to face at the\nchess-table.\n\n“Well, you know you said you'd be gone ten minutes,” Arkwright reminded\nher, politely.\n\n“Yes, I know I did.” And Billy, to her credit, did not even smile at the\nman who did not know ten minutes from fifty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. BY A BABY'S HAND\n\n\nAfter all, it was the baby's hand that did it, as was proper, and\nperhaps to be expected; for surely, was it not Bertram, Jr.'s place to\nshow his parents that he was, indeed, no Wedge, but a dear and precious\nTie binding two loving, loyal hearts more and more closely together?\nIt would seem, indeed, that Bertram, Jr., thought so, perhaps, and very\nbravely he set about it; though, to carry out his purpose, he had to\nturn his steps into an unfamiliar way--a way of pain, and weariness, and\ndanger.\n\nIt was Arkwright who told Bertram that the baby was very sick, and\nthat Billy wanted him. Bertram went home at once to find a distracted,\nwhite-faced Billy, and a twisted, pain-racked little creature, who it\nwas almost impossible to believe was the happy, laughing baby boy he had\nleft that morning.\n\nFor the next two weeks nothing was thought of in the silent old Beacon\nStreet house but the tiny little life hovering so near Death's door\nthat twice it appeared to have slipped quite across the threshold.\nAll through those terrible weeks it seemed as if Billy neither ate\nnor slept; and always at her side, comforting, cheering, and helping\nwherever possible was Bertram, tender, loving, and marvelously\nthoughtful.\n\nThen came the turning point when the universe itself appeared to\nhang upon a baby's breath. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, came the\nfluttering back of the tiny spirit into the longing arms stretched so\nfar, far out to meet and hold it. And the father and the mother, looking\ninto each other's sleepless, dark-ringed eyes, knew that their son was\nonce more theirs to love and cherish.\n\nWhen two have gone together with a dear one down into the Valley of the\nShadow of Death, and have come back, either mourning or rejoicing, they\nfind a different world from the one they had left. Things that were\ngreat before seem small, and some things that were small seem great.\nAt least Bertram and Billy found their world thus changed when together\nthey came back bringing their son with them.\n\nIn the long weeks of convalescence, when the healthy rosiness stole\nbit by bit into the baby's waxen face, and the light of recognition and\nunderstanding crept day by day into the baby's eyes, there was many a\nquiet hour for heart-to-heart talks between the two who so anxiously and\njoyously hailed every rosy tint and fleeting sparkle. And there was\nso much to tell, so much to hear, so much to talk about! And always,\nrunning through everything, was that golden thread of joy, beside which\nall else paled--that they had Baby and each other. As if anything else\nmattered!\n\nTo be sure, there was Bertram's arm. Very early in their talks Billy\nfound out about that. But Billy, with Baby getting well, was not to be\ndaunted, even by this.\n\n“Nonsense, darling--not paint again, indeed! Why, Bertram, of course you\nwill,” she cried confidently.\n\n“But, Billy, the doctor said,” began Bertram; but Billy would not even\nlisten.\n\n“Very well, what if he did, dear?” she interrupted. “What if he did\nsay you couldn't use your right arm much again?” Billy's voice broke\na little, then quickly steadied into something very much like triumph.\n“You've got your left one!”\n\nBertram shook his head.\n\n“I can't paint with that.”\n\n“Yes, you can,” insisted Billy, firmly. “Why, Bertram, what do you\nsuppose you were given two arms for if not to fight with both of them?\nAnd I'm going to be ever so much prouder of what you paint now, because\nI'll know how splendidly you worked to do it. Besides, there's Baby. As\nif you weren't ever going to paint for Baby! Why, Bertram, I'm going to\nhave you paint Baby, one of these days. Think how pleased he'll be to\nsee it when he grows up! He's nicer, anyhow, than any old 'Face of a\nGirl' you ever did. Paint? Why, Bertram, darling, of course you're going\nto paint, and better than you ever did before!”\n\nBertram shook his head again; but this time he smiled, and patted\nBilly's cheek with the tip of his forefinger.\n\n“As if I could!” he disclaimed. But that afternoon he went into his\nlong-deserted studio and hunted up his last unfinished picture. For\nsome time he stood motionless before it; then, with a quick gesture of\ndetermination, he got out his palette, paints, and brushes. This time\nnot until he had painted ten, a dozen, a score of strokes, did he drop\nhis brush with a sigh and carefully erase the fresh paint on the canvas.\nThe next day he worked longer, and this time he allowed a little, a very\nlittle, of what he had done to remain.\n\nThe third day Billy herself found him at his easel.\n\n“I wonder--do you suppose I could?” he asked fearfully.\n\n“Why, dearest, of course you can! Haven't you noticed? Can't you see how\nmuch more you can do with your left hand now? You've _had_ to use it,\nyou see. _I've_ seen you do a lot of things with it, lately, that you\nnever used to do at all. And, of course, the more you do with it, the\nmore you can!”\n\n“I know; but that doesn't mean that I can paint with it,” sighed\nBertram, ruefully eyeing the tiny bit of fresh color his canvas showed\nfor his long afternoon's work.\n\n“You wait and see,” nodded Billy, with so overwhelming a cheery\nconfidence that Bertram, looking into her glowing face, was conscious\nof a curious throb of exultation, almost as if already the victory were\nhis.\n\nBut it was not always of Bertram's broken arm, nor even of his work that\nthey talked. Bertram, hanging over the baby's crib to assure himself\nthat the rosiness and the sparkle were really growing more apparent\nevery day, used to wonder sometimes how ever in the world he could have\nbeen jealous of his son. He said as much one day to Billy.\n\nTo Billy it was a most astounding idea.\n\n“You mean you were actually jealous of your own baby?” she gasped.\n“Why, Bertram, how could--And was that why you--you sought distraction\nand--Oh, but, Bertram, that was all my f-fault,” she quavered\nremorsefully. “I wouldn't play, nor sing, nor go to walk, nor anything;\nand I wore horrid frowzy wrappers all the time, and--”\n\n“Oh, come, come, Billy,” expostulated the man. “I'm not going to have\nyou talk like that about _my wife!_”\n\n“But I did--the book said I did,” wailed Billy.\n\n“The book? Good heavens! Are there any books in this, too?” demanded\nBertram.\n\n“Yes, the same one; the--the 'Talks to Young Wives,'” nodded Billy.\nAnd then, because some things had grown small to them, and some others\ngreat, they both laughed happily.\n\nBut even this was not quite all; for one evening, very shyly, Billy\nbrought out the chessboard.\n\n“Of course I can't play well,” she faltered; “and maybe you don't want\nto play with me at all.”\n\nBut Bertram, when he found out why she had learned, was very sure he did\nwant very much to play with her.\n\nBilly did not beat, of course. But she did several times experience--for\na few blissful minutes--the pleasure of seeing Bertram sit motionless,\nstudying the board, because of a move she had made. And though, in the\nend, her king was ignominiously trapped with not an unguarded square\nupon which to set his poor distracted foot, the memory of those blissful\nminutes when she had made Bertram “stare” more than paid for the final\ncheckmate.\n\nBy the middle of June the baby was well enough to be taken to the\nbeach, and Bertram was so fortunate as to secure the same house they had\noccupied before. Once again William went down in Maine for his fishing\ntrip, and the Strata was closed. In the beach house Bertram was painting\nindustriously--with his left hand. Almost he was beginning to feel\nBilly's enthusiasm. Almost he was believing that he _was_ doing good\nwork. It was not the “Face of a Girl,” now. It was the face of a baby:\nsmiling, laughing, even crying, sometimes; at other times just gazing\nstraight into your eyes with adorable soberness. Bertram still went\ninto Boston twice a week for treatment, though the treatment itself had\nchanged. The great surgeon had sent him to still another specialist.\n\n“There's a chance--though perhaps a small one,” he had said. “I'd like\nyou to try it, anyway.”\n\nAs the summer advanced, Bertram thought sometimes that he could see a\nslight improvement in his injured arm; but he tried not to think too\nmuch about this. He had thought the same thing before, only to be\ndisappointed in the end. Besides, he was undeniably interested just now\nin seeing if he _could_ paint with his left hand. Billy was so sure,\nand she had said that she would be prouder than ever of him, if he\ncould--and he would like to make Billy proud! Then, too, there was the\nbaby--he had no idea a baby could be so interesting to paint. He was not\nsure but that he was going to like to paint babies even better than he\nhad liked to paint his “Face of a Girl” that had brought him his first\nfame.\n\nIn September the family returned to the Strata. The move was made a\nlittle earlier this year on account of Alice Greggory's wedding.\n\nAlice was to be married in the pretty living-room at the Annex, just\nwhere Billy herself had been married a few short years before; and Billy\nhad great plans for the wedding--not all of which she was able to carry\nout, for Alice, like Marie before her, had very strong objections to\nbeing placed under too great obligations.\n\n“And you see, really, anyway,” she told Billy, “I owe the whole thing to\nyou, to begin with--even my husband.”\n\n“Nonsense! Of course you don't,” disputed Billy.\n\n“But I do. If it hadn't been for you I should never have found him\nagain, and of _course_ I shouldn't have had this dear little home to be\nmarried in. And I never could have left mother if she hadn't had\nAunt Hannah and the Annex which means you. And if I hadn't found Mr.\nArkwright, I might never have known how--how I could go back to my old\nhome (as I am going on my honeymoon trip), and just know that every one\nof my old friends who shakes hands with me isn't pitying me now, because\nI'm my father's daughter. And that means you; for you see I never would\nhave known that my father's name was cleared if it hadn't been for you.\nAnd--”\n\n“Oh, Alice, please, please,” begged Billy, laughingly raising two\nprotesting hands. “Why don't you say that it's to me you owe just\nbreathing, and be done with it?”\n\n“Well, I will, then,” avowed Alice, doggedly. “And it's true, too, for,\nhonestly, my dear, I don't believe I would have been breathing to-day,\nnor mother, either, if you hadn't found us that morning, and taken us\nout of those awful rooms.”\n\n“I? Never! You wouldn't let me take you out,” laughed Billy. “You proud\nlittle thing! Maybe _you've_ forgotten how you turned poor Uncle William\nand me out into the cold, cold world that morning, just because we dared\nto aspire to your Lowestoft teapot; but I haven't!”\n\n“Oh, Billy, please, _don't_,” begged Alice, the painful color staining\nher face. “If you knew how I've hated myself since for the way I acted\nthat day--and, really, you did take us away from there, you know.”\n\n“No, I didn't. I merely found two good tenants for Mr. and Mrs. Delano,”\n corrected Billy, with a sober face.\n\n“Oh, yes, I know all about that,” smiled Alice, affectionately; “and you\ngot mother and me here to keep Aunt Hannah company and teach Tommy Dunn;\nand you got Aunt Hannah here to keep us company and take care of Tommy\nDunn; and you got Tommy Dunn here so Aunt Hannah and we could have\nsomebody to teach and take care of; and, as for the others,--” But Billy\nput her hands to her ears and fled.\n\nThe wedding was to be on the fifteenth. From the West Kate wrote that\nof course it was none of her affairs, particularly as neither of the\ninterested parties was a relation, but still she should think that for\na man in Mr. Arkwright's position, nothing but a church wedding would\ndo at all, as, of course, he did, in a way, belong to the public. Alice,\nhowever, declared that perhaps he did belong to the public, when he was\nDon Somebody-or-other in doublet and hose; but when he was just plain\nMichael Jeremiah Arkwright in a frock coat he was hers, and she did not\npropose to make a Grand Opera show of her wedding. And as Arkwright,\ntoo, very much disapproved of the church-wedding idea, the two were\nmarried in the Annex living-room at noon on the fifteenth as originally\nplanned, in spite of Mrs. Kate Hartwell's letter.\n\nIt was soon after the wedding that Bertram told Billy he wished she\nwould sit for him with Bertram, Jr.\n\n“I want to try my hand at you both together,” he coaxed.\n\n“Why, of course, if you like, dear,” agreed Billy, promptly, “though I\nthink Baby is just as nice, and even nicer, alone.”\n\nOnce again all over Bertram's studio began to appear sketches of Billy,\nthis time a glorified, tender Billy, with the wonderful mother-love in\nher eyes. Then, after several sketches of trial poses, Bertram began his\npicture of Billy and the baby together.\n\nEven now Bertram was not sure of his work. He knew that he could not yet\npaint with his old freedom and ease; he knew that his stroke was not so\nsure, so untrammeled. But he knew, too, that he had gained wonderfully,\nduring the summer, and that he was gaining now, every day. To Billy he\nsaid nothing of all this. Even to himself he scarcely put his hope into\nwords; but in his heart he knew that what he was really painting his\n“Mother and Child” picture for was the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition in\nMarch--if he could but put upon canvas the vision that was spurring him\non.\n\nAnd so Bertram worked all through those short winter days, not always\nupon the one picture, of course, but upon some picture or sketch that\nwould help to give his still uncertain left hand the skill that had\nbelonged to its mate. And always, cheering, encouraging, insisting on\nvictory, was Billy, so that even had Bertram been tempted, sometimes,\nto give up, he could not have done so--and faced Billy's grieved,\ndisappointed eyes. And when at last his work was completed, and the\npictured mother and child in all their marvelous life and beauty seemed\nready to step from the canvas, Billy drew a long ecstatic breath.\n\n“Oh, Bertram, it _is_, it is the best work you have ever done.” Billy\nwas looking at the baby. Always she had ignored herself as part of the\npicture. “And won't it be fine for the Exhibition!”\n\nBertram's hand tightened on the chair-back in front of him. For a moment\nhe could not speak. Then, a bit huskily, he asked:\n\n“Would you dare--risk it?”\n\n“Risk it! Why, Bertram Henshaw, I've meant that picture for the\nExhibition from the very first--only I never dreamed you could get it so\nperfectly lovely. _Now_ what do you say about Baby being nicer than any\nold 'Face of a Girl' that you ever did?” she triumphed.\n\nAnd Bertram, who, even to himself, had not dared whisper the\nword exhibition, gave a tremulous laugh that was almost a sob, so\noverwhelming was his sudden realization of what faith and confidence had\nmeant to Billy, his wife.\n\nIf there was still a lingering doubt in Bertram's mind, it must\nhave been dispelled in less than an hour after the Bohemian Ten Club\nExhibition flung open its doors on its opening night. Once again Bertram\nfound his picture the cynosure of all admiring eyes, and himself the\ncenter of an enthusiastic group of friends and fellow-artists who vied\nwith each other in hearty words of congratulation. And when, later,\nthe feared critics, whose names and opinions counted for so much in his\nworld, had their say in the daily press and weekly reviews, Bertram\nknew how surely indeed he had won. And when he read that “Henshaw's\nwork shows now a peculiar strength, a sort of reserve power, as it were,\nwhich, beautiful as was his former work, it never showed before,” he\nsmiled grimly, and said to Billy:\n\n“I suppose, now, that was the fighting I did with my good left hand, eh,\ndear?”\n\nBut there was yet one more drop that was to make Bertram's cup of joy\nbrim to overflowing. It came just one month after the Exhibition in the\nshape of a terse dozen words from the doctor. Bertram fairly flew home\nthat day. He had no consciousness of any means of locomotion. He thought\nhe was going to tell his wife at once his great good news; but when he\nsaw her, speech suddenly fled, and all that he could do was to draw her\nclosely to him with his left arm and hide his face.\n\n“Why, Bertram, dearest, what--what is it?” stammered the thoroughly\nfrightened Billy. “Has anything-happened?”\n\n“No, no--yes--yes, everything has happened. I mean, it's going to\nhappen,” choked the man. “Billy, that old chap says that I'm going to\nhave my arm again. Think of it--my good right arm that I've lost so\nlong!”\n\n“_Oh, Bertram!_” breathed Billy. And she, too, fell to sobbing.\n\nLater, when speech was more coherent, she faltered:\n\n“Well, anyway, it doesn't make any difference _how_ many beautiful\npictures you p-paint, after this, Bertram, I _can't_ be prouder of any\nthan I am of the one your l--left hand did.”\n\n“Oh, but I have you to thank for all that, dear.”\n\n“No, you haven't,” disputed Billy, blinking teary eyes; “but--” she\npaused, then went on spiritedly, “but, anyhow, I--I don't believe any\none--not even Kate--can say _now_ that--that I've been a hindrance to\nyou in your c-career!”\n\n“Hindrance!” scoffed Bertram, in a tone that left no room for doubt, and\nwith a kiss that left even less, if possible.\n\nBilly, for still another minute, was silent; then, with a wistfulness\nthat was half playful, half serious, she sighed:\n\n“Bertram, I believe being married is something like clocks, you know,\n'specially at the first.”\n\n“Clocks, dear?”\n\n“Yes. I was out to Aunt Hannah's to-day. She was fussing with her\nclock--the one that strikes half an hour ahead--and I saw all those\nquantities of wheels, little and big, that have to go just so, with\nall the little cogs fitting into all the other little cogs just exactly\nright. Well, that's like marriage. See? There's such a lot of\nlittle cogs in everyday life that have to be fitted so they'll run\nsmoothly--that have to be adjusted, 'specially at the first.”\n\n“Oh, Billy, what an idea!”\n\n“But it's so, really, Bertram. Anyhow, I know my cogs were always\ngetting out of place at the first,” laughed Billy. “And I was like Aunt\nHannah's clock, too, always going off half an hour ahead of time. And\nmaybe I shall be so again, sometimes. But, Bertram,”--her voice shook a\nlittle--“if you'll just look at my face you'll see that I tell the right\ntime there, just as Aunt Hannah's clock does. I'm sure, always, I'll\ntell the right time there, even if I do go off half an hour ahead!”\n\n“As if I didn't know that,” answered Bertram, very low and tenderly.\n“Besides, I reckon I have some cogs of my own that need adjusting!”"
