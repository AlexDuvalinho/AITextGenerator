 "text": "ROUND THE RED LAMP\n\nBEING FACTS AND FANCIES OF MEDICAL LIFE\n\nBy SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE\n\n\n\n\nTHE PREFACE.\n\n[Being an extract from a long and animated correspondence with a friend\nin America.]\n\nI quite recognise the force of your objection that an invalid or a\nwoman in weak health would get no good from stories which attempt to\ntreat some features of medical life with a certain amount of realism.\nIf you deal with this life at all, however, and if you are anxious to\nmake your doctors something more than marionettes, it is quite\nessential that you should paint the darker side, since it is that which\nis principally presented to the surgeon or physician.  He sees many\nbeautiful things, it is true, fortitude and heroism, love and\nself-sacrifice; but they are all called forth (as our nobler qualities\nare always called forth) by bitter sorrow and trial.  One cannot write\nof medical life and be merry over it.\n\nThen why write of it, you may ask?  If a subject is painful why treat\nit at all?  I answer that it is the province of fiction to treat\npainful things as well as cheerful ones.  The story which wiles away a\nweary hour fulfils an obviously good purpose, but not more so, I hold,\nthan that which helps to emphasise the graver side of life.  A tale\nwhich may startle the reader out of his usual grooves of thought, and\nshocks him into seriousness, plays the part of the alterative and tonic\nin medicine, bitter to the taste but bracing in the result.  There are\na few stories in this little collection which might have such an\neffect, and I have so far shared in your feeling that I have reserved\nthem from serial publication.  In book-form the reader can see that\nthey are medical stories, and can, if he or she be so minded, avoid\nthem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. CONAN DOYLE.\n\n\nP. S.--You ask about the Red Lamp.  It is the usual sign of the general\npractitioner in England.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n  BEHIND THE TIMES\n  HIS FIRST OPERATION\n  A STRAGGLER OF '15\n  THE THIRD GENERATION\n  A FALSE START\n  THE CURSE OF EVE\n  SWEETHEARTS\n  A PHYSIOLOGIST'S WIFE\n  THE CASE OF LADY SANNOX\n  A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY\n  A MEDICAL DOCUMENT\n  LOT NO. 249\n  THE LOS AMIGOS FIASCO\n  THE DOCTORS OF HOYLAND\n  THE SURGEON TALKS\n\n\n\n\nROUND THE RED LAMP.\n\n\n\n\nBEHIND THE TIMES.\n\nMy first interview with Dr. James Winter was under dramatic\ncircumstances.  It occurred at two in the morning in the bedroom of an\nold country house.  I kicked him twice on the white waistcoat and\nknocked off his gold spectacles, while he with the aid of a female\naccomplice stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and thrust me\ninto a warm bath.  I am told that one of my parents, who happened to be\npresent, remarked in a whisper that there was nothing the matter with\nmy lungs.  I cannot recall how Dr. Winter looked at the time, for I had\nother things to think of, but his description of my own appearance is\nfar from flattering.  A fluffy head, a body like a trussed goose, very\nbandy legs, and feet with the soles turned inwards--those are the main\nitems which he can remember.\n\nFrom this time onwards the epochs of my life were the periodical\nassaults which Dr. Winter made upon me.  He vaccinated me; he cut me\nfor an abscess; he blistered me for mumps.  It was a world of peace and\nhe the one dark cloud that threatened.  But at last there came a time\nof real illness--a time when I lay for months together inside my\nwickerwork-basket bed, and then it was that I learned that that hard\nface could relax, that those country-made creaking boots could steal\nvery gently to a bedside, and that that rough voice could thin into a\nwhisper when it spoke to a sick child.\n\nAnd now the child is himself a medical man, and yet Dr. Winter is the\nsame as ever.  I can see no change since first I can remember him, save\nthat perhaps the brindled hair is a trifle whiter, and the huge\nshoulders a little more bowed.  He is a very tall man, though he loses\na couple of inches from his stoop.  That big back of his has curved\nitself over sick beds until it has set in that shape.  His face is of a\nwalnut brown, and tells of long winter drives over bleak country roads,\nwith the wind and the rain in his teeth.  It looks smooth at a little\ndistance, but as you approach him you see that it is shot with\ninnumerable fine wrinkles like a last year's apple.  They are hardly to\nbe seen when he is in repose; but when he laughs his face breaks like a\nstarred glass, and you realise then that though he looks old, he must\nbe older than he looks.\n\n\nHow old that is I could never discover.  I have often tried to find\nout, and have struck his stream as high up as George IV and even the\nRegency, but without ever getting quite to the source.  His mind must\nhave been open to impressions very early, but it must also have closed\nearly, for the politics of the day have little interest for him, while\nhe is fiercely excited about questions which are entirely prehistoric.\nHe shakes his head when he speaks of the first Reform Bill and\nexpresses grave doubts as to its wisdom, and I have heard him, when he\nwas warmed by a glass of wine, say bitter things about Robert Peel and\nhis abandoning of the Corn Laws.  The death of that statesman brought\nthe history of England to a definite close, and Dr. Winter refers to\neverything which had happened since then as to an insignificant\nanticlimax.\n\nBut it was only when I had myself become a medical man that I was able\nto appreciate how entirely he is a survival of a past generation.  He\nhad learned his medicine under that obsolete and forgotten system by\nwhich a youth was apprenticed to a surgeon, in the days when the study\nof anatomy was often approached through a violated grave.  His views\nupon his own profession are even more reactionary than in politics.\nFifty years have brought him little and deprived him of less.\nVaccination was well within the teaching of his youth, though I think\nhe has a secret preference for inoculation.  Bleeding he would practise\nfreely but for public opinion.  Chloroform he regards as a dangerous\ninnovation, and he always clicks with his tongue when it is mentioned.\nHe has even been known to say vain things about Laennec, and to refer\nto the stethoscope as \"a new-fangled French toy.\"  He carries one in\nhis hat out of deference to the expectations of his patients, but he is\nvery hard of hearing, so that it makes little difference whether he\nuses it or not.\n\nHe reads, as a duty, his weekly medical paper, so that he has a general\nidea as to the advance of modern science.  He always persists in\nlooking upon it as a huge and rather ludicrous experiment.  The germ\ntheory of disease set him chuckling for a long time, and his favourite\njoke in the sick room was to say, \"Shut the door or the germs will be\ngetting in.\" As to the Darwinian theory, it struck him as being the\ncrowning joke of the century.  \"The children in the nursery and the\nancestors in the stable,\" he would cry, and laugh the tears out of his\neyes.\n\nHe is so very much behind the day that occasionally, as things move\nround in their usual circle, he finds himself, to his bewilderment, in\nthe front of the fashion.  Dietetic treatment, for example, had been\nmuch in vogue in his youth, and he has more practical knowledge of it\nthan any one whom I have met.  Massage, too, was familiar to him when\nit was new to our generation.  He had been trained also at a time when\ninstruments were in a rudimentary state, and when men learned to trust\nmore to their own fingers.  He has a model surgical hand, muscular in\nthe palm, tapering in the fingers, \"with an eye at the end of each.\"  I\nshall not easily forget how Dr. Patterson and I cut Sir John Sirwell,\nthe County Member, and were unable to find the stone.  It was a\nhorrible moment.  Both our careers were at stake.  And then it was that\nDr. Winter, whom we had asked out of courtesy to be present, introduced\ninto the wound a finger which seemed to our excited senses to be about\nnine inches long, and hooked out the stone at the end of it.  \"It's\nalways well to bring one in your waistcoat-pocket,\" said he with a\nchuckle, \"but I suppose you youngsters are above all that.\"\n\nWe made him president of our branch of the British Medical Association,\nbut he resigned after the first meeting.  \"The young men are too much\nfor me,\" he said.  \"I don't understand what they are talking about.\"\nYet his patients do very well.  He has the healing touch--that magnetic\nthing which defies explanation or analysis, but which is a very evident\nfact none the less.  His mere presence leaves the patient with more\nhopefulness and vitality.  The sight of disease affects him as dust\ndoes a careful housewife.  It makes him angry and impatient.  \"Tut,\ntut, this will never do!\" he cries, as he takes over a new case.  He\nwould shoo Death out of the room as though he were an intrusive hen.\nBut when the intruder refuses to be dislodged, when the blood moves\nmore slowly and the eyes grow dimmer, then it is that Dr. Winter is of\nmore avail than all the drugs in his surgery.  Dying folk cling to his\nhand as if the presence of his bulk and vigour gives them more courage\nto face the change; and that kindly, windbeaten face has been the last\nearthly impression which many a sufferer has carried into the unknown.\n\nWhen Dr. Patterson and I--both of us young, energetic, and\nup-to-date--settled in the district, we were most cordially received by\nthe old doctor, who would have been only too happy to be relieved of\nsome of his patients.  The patients themselves, however, followed their\nown inclinations--which is a reprehensible way that patients have--so\nthat we remained neglected, with our modern instruments and our latest\nalkaloids, while he was serving out senna and calomel to all the\ncountryside.  We both of us loved the old fellow, but at the same time,\nin the privacy of our own intimate conversations, we could not help\ncommenting upon this deplorable lack of judgment.  \"It's all very well\nfor the poorer people,\" said Patterson.  \"But after all the educated\nclasses have a right to expect that their medical man will know the\ndifference between a mitral murmur and a bronchitic rale.  It's the\njudicial frame of mind, not the sympathetic, which is the essential\none.\"\n\nI thoroughly agreed with Patterson in what he said.  It happened,\nhowever, that very shortly afterwards the epidemic of influenza broke\nout, and we were all worked to death.  One morning I met Patterson on\nmy round, and found him looking rather pale and fagged out.  He made\nthe same remark about me.  I was, in fact, feeling far from well, and I\nlay upon the sofa all the afternoon with a splitting headache and pains\nin every joint.  As evening closed in, I could no longer disguise the\nfact that the scourge was upon me, and I felt that I should have\nmedical advice without delay.  It was of Patterson, naturally, that I\nthought, but somehow the idea of him had suddenly become repugnant to\nme.  I thought of his cold, critical attitude, of his endless\nquestions, of his tests and his tappings.  I wanted something more\nsoothing--something more genial.\n\n\"Mrs. Hudson,\" said I to my housekeeper, \"would you kindly run along to\nold Dr. Winter and tell him that I should be obliged to him if he would\nstep round?\"\n\nShe was back with an answer presently.  \"Dr. Winter will come round in\nan hour or so, sir; but he has just been called in to attend Dr.\nPatterson.\"\n\n\n\n\nHIS FIRST OPERATION.\n\nIt was the first day of the winter session, and the third year's man\nwas walking with the first year's man.  Twelve o'clock was just booming\nout from the Tron Church.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said the third year's man.  \"You have never seen an\noperation?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Then this way, please.  This is Rutherford's historic bar.  A glass of\nsherry, please, for this gentleman.  You are rather sensitive, are you\nnot?\"\n\n\"My nerves are not very strong, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Hum!  Another glass of sherry for this gentleman.  We are going to an\noperation now, you know.\"\n\nThe novice squared his shoulders and made a gallant attempt to look\nunconcerned.\n\n\"Nothing very bad--eh?\"\n\n\"Well, yes--pretty bad.\"\n\n\"An--an amputation?\"\n\n\"No; it's a bigger affair than that.\"\n\n\"I think--I think they must be expecting me at home.\"\n\n\"There's no sense in funking.  If you don't go to-day, you must\nto-morrow.  Better get it over at once.  Feel pretty fit?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; all right!\"  The smile was not a success.\n\n\"One more glass of sherry, then.  Now come on or we shall be late.  I\nwant you to be well in front.\"\n\n\"Surely that is not necessary.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is far better!  What a drove of students!  There are plenty of\nnew men among them.  You can tell them easily enough, can't you? If\nthey were going down to be operated upon themselves, they could not\nlook whiter.\"\n\n\"I don't think I should look as white.\"\n\n\"Well, I was just the same myself.  But the feeling soon wears off.\nYou see a fellow with a face like plaster, and before the week is out\nhe is eating his lunch in the dissecting rooms.  I'll tell you all\nabout the case when we get to the theatre.\"\n\nThe students were pouring down the sloping street which led to the\ninfirmary--each with his little sheaf of note-books in his hand.  There\nwere pale, frightened lads, fresh from the high schools, and callous\nold chronics, whose generation had passed on and left them.  They swept\nin an unbroken, tumultuous stream from the university gate to the\nhospital.  The figures and gait of the men were young, but there was\nlittle youth in most of their faces.  Some looked as if they ate too\nlittle--a few as if they drank too much.  Tall and short, tweed-coated\nand black, round-shouldered, bespectacled, and slim, they crowded with\nclatter of feet and rattle of sticks through the hospital gate.  Now\nand again they thickened into two lines, as the carriage of a surgeon\nof the staff rolled over the cobblestones between.\n\n\"There's going to be a crowd at Archer's,\" whispered the senior man\nwith suppressed excitement.  \"It is grand to see him at work.  I've\nseen him jab all round the aorta until it made me jumpy to watch him.\nThis way, and mind the whitewash.\"\n\nThey passed under an archway and down a long, stone-flagged corridor,\nwith drab-coloured doors on either side, each marked with a number.\nSome of them were ajar, and the novice glanced into them with tingling\nnerves.  He was reassured to catch a glimpse of cheery fires, lines of\nwhite-counterpaned beds, and a profusion of coloured texts upon the\nwall.  The corridor opened upon a small hall, with a fringe of poorly\nclad people seated all round upon benches.  A young man, with a pair of\nscissors stuck like a flower in his buttonhole and a note-book in his\nhand, was passing from one to the other, whispering and writing.\n\n\"Anything good?\" asked the third year's man.\n\n\"You should have been here yesterday,\" said the out-patient clerk,\nglancing up.  \"We had a regular field day.  A popliteal aneurism, a\nColles' fracture, a spina bifida, a tropical abscess, and an\nelephantiasis.  How's that for a single haul?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I missed it.  But they'll come again, I suppose.  What's up\nwith the old gentleman?\"\n\nA broken workman was sitting in the shadow, rocking himself slowly to\nand fro, and groaning.  A woman beside him was trying to console him,\npatting his shoulder with a hand which was spotted over with curious\nlittle white blisters.\n\n\"It's a fine carbuncle,\" said the clerk, with the air of a connoisseur\nwho describes his orchids to one who can appreciate them.  \"It's on his\nback and the passage is draughty, so we must not look at it, must we,\ndaddy?  Pemphigus,\" he added carelessly, pointing to the woman's\ndisfigured hands.  \"Would you care to stop and take out a metacarpal?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.  We are due at Archer's.  Come on!\" and they rejoined\nthe throng which was hurrying to the theatre of the famous surgeon.\n\nThe tiers of horseshoe benches rising from the floor to the ceiling\nwere already packed, and the novice as he entered saw vague curving\nlines of faces in front of him, and heard the deep buzz of a hundred\nvoices, and sounds of laughter from somewhere up above him.  His\ncompanion spied an opening on the second bench, and they both squeezed\ninto it.\n\n\"This is grand!\" the senior man whispered.  \"You'll have a rare view of\nit all.\"\n\nOnly a single row of heads intervened between them and the operating\ntable.  It was of unpainted deal, plain, strong, and scrupulously\nclean.  A sheet of brown water-proofing covered half of it, and beneath\nstood a large tin tray full of sawdust.  On the further side, in front\nof the window, there was a board which was strewed with glittering\ninstruments--forceps, tenacula, saws, canulas, and trocars.  A line of\nknives, with long, thin, delicate blades, lay at one side.  Two young\nmen lounged in front of this, one threading needles, the other doing\nsomething to a brass coffee-pot-like thing which hissed out puffs of\nsteam.\n\n\"That's Peterson,\" whispered the senior, \"the big, bald man in the\nfront row.  He's the skin-grafting man, you know.  And that's Anthony\nBrowne, who took a larynx out successfully last winter.  And there's\nMurphy, the pathologist, and Stoddart, the eye-man.  You'll come to\nknow them all soon.\"\n\n\"Who are the two men at the table?\"\n\n\"Nobody--dressers.  One has charge of the instruments and the other of\nthe puffing Billy.  It's Lister's antiseptic spray, you know, and\nArcher's one of the carbolic-acid men.  Hayes is the leader of the\ncleanliness-and-cold-water school, and they all hate each other like\npoison.\"\n\nA flutter of interest passed through the closely packed benches as a\nwoman in petticoat and bodice was led in by two nurses.  A red woolen\nshawl was draped over her head and round her neck.  The face which\nlooked out from it was that of a woman in the prime of her years, but\ndrawn with suffering, and of a peculiar beeswax tint.  Her head drooped\nas she walked, and one of the nurses, with her arm round her waist, was\nwhispering consolation in her ear.  She gave a quick side-glance at the\ninstrument table as she passed, but the nurses turned her away from it.\n\n\"What ails her?\" asked the novice.\n\n\"Cancer of the parotid.  It's the devil of a case; extends right away\nback behind the carotids.  There's hardly a man but Archer would dare\nto follow it.  Ah, here he is himself!\"\n\nAs he spoke, a small, brisk, iron-grey man came striding into the room,\nrubbing his hands together as he walked.  He had a clean-shaven face,\nof the naval officer type, with large, bright eyes, and a firm,\nstraight mouth.  Behind him came his big house-surgeon, with his\ngleaming pince-nez, and a trail of dressers, who grouped themselves\ninto the corners of the room.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried the surgeon in a voice as hard and brisk as his\nmanner, \"we have here an interesting case of tumour of the parotid,\noriginally cartilaginous but now assuming malignant characteristics,\nand therefore requiring excision.  On to the table, nurse!  Thank you!\nChloroform, clerk!  Thank you!  You can take the shawl off, nurse.\"\n\nThe woman lay back upon the water-proofed pillow, and her murderous\ntumour lay revealed.  In itself it was a pretty thing--ivory white,\nwith a mesh of blue veins, and curving gently from jaw to chest.  But\nthe lean, yellow face and the stringy throat were in horrible contrast\nwith the plumpness and sleekness of this monstrous growth.  The surgeon\nplaced a hand on each side of it and pressed it slowly backwards and\nforwards.\n\n\"Adherent at one place, gentlemen,\" he cried.  \"The growth involves the\ncarotids and jugulars, and passes behind the ramus of the jaw, whither\nwe must be prepared to follow it.  It is impossible to say how deep our\ndissection may carry us.  Carbolic tray.  Thank you!  Dressings of\ncarbolic gauze, if you please!  Push the chloroform, Mr. Johnson.  Have\nthe small saw ready in case it is necessary to remove the jaw.\"\n\nThe patient was moaning gently under the towel which had been placed\nover her face.  She tried to raise her arms and to draw up her knees,\nbut two dressers restrained her.  The heavy air was full of the\npenetrating smells of carbolic acid and of chloroform.  A muffled cry\ncame from under the towel, and then a snatch of a song, sung in a high,\nquavering, monotonous voice:\n\n  \"He says, says he,\n  If you fly with me\n  You'll be mistress of the ice-cream van.\n  You'll be mistress of the----\"\n\nIt mumbled off into a drone and stopped.  The surgeon came across,\nstill rubbing his hands, and spoke to an elderly man in front of the\nnovice.\n\n\"Narrow squeak for the Government,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, ten is enough.\"\n\n\"They won't have ten long.  They'd do better to resign before they are\ndriven to it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I should fight it out.\"\n\n\"What's the use.  They can't get past the committee even if they got a\nvote in the House.  I was talking to----\"\n\n\"Patient's ready, sir,\" said the dresser.\n\n\"Talking to McDonald--but I'll tell you about it presently.\"  He walked\nback to the patient, who was breathing in long, heavy gasps.  \"I\npropose,\" said he, passing his hand over the tumour in an almost\ncaressing fashion, \"to make a free incision over the posterior border,\nand to take another forward at right angles to the lower end of it.\nMight I trouble you for a medium knife, Mr. Johnson?\"\n\nThe novice, with eyes which were dilating with horror, saw the surgeon\npick up the long, gleaming knife, dip it into a tin basin, and balance\nit in his fingers as an artist might his brush.  Then he saw him pinch\nup the skin above the tumour with his left hand.  At the sight his\nnerves, which had already been tried once or twice that day, gave way\nutterly.  His head swain round, and he felt that in another instant he\nmight faint.  He dared not look at the patient.  He dug his thumbs into\nhis ears lest some scream should come to haunt him, and he fixed his\neyes rigidly upon the wooden ledge in front of him.  One glance, one\ncry, would, he knew, break down the shred of self-possession which he\nstill retained.  He tried to think of cricket, of green fields and\nrippling water, of his sisters at home--of anything rather than of what\nwas going on so near him.\n\nAnd yet somehow, even with his ears stopped up, sounds seemed to\npenetrate to him and to carry their own tale.  He heard, or thought\nthat he heard, the long hissing of the carbolic engine.  Then he was\nconscious of some movement among the dressers.  Were there groans, too,\nbreaking in upon him, and some other sound, some fluid sound, which was\nmore dreadfully suggestive still?  His mind would keep building up\nevery step of the operation, and fancy made it more ghastly than fact\ncould have been.  His nerves tingled and quivered.  Minute by minute\nthe giddiness grew more marked, the numb, sickly feeling at his heart\nmore distressing.  And then suddenly, with a groan, his head pitching\nforward, and his brow cracking sharply upon the narrow wooden shelf in\nfront of him, he lay in a dead faint.\n\n\nWhen he came to himself, he was lying in the empty theatre, with his\ncollar and shirt undone.  The third year's man was dabbing a wet sponge\nover his face, and a couple of grinning dressers were looking on.\n\n\"All right,\" cried the novice, sitting up and rubbing his eyes.  \"I'm\nsorry to have made an ass of myself.\"\n\n\"Well, so I should think,\" said his companion.\n\n\"What on earth did you faint about?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it.  It was that operation.\"\n\n\"What operation?\"\n\n\"Why, that cancer.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then the three students burst out laughing.\n\"Why, you juggins!\" cried the senior man, \"there never was an operation\nat all!  They found the patient didn't stand the chloroform well, and\nso the whole thing was off.  Archer has been giving us one of his racy\nlectures, and you fainted just in the middle of his favourite story.\"\n\n\n\n\nA STRAGGLER OF '15.\n\nIt was a dull October morning, and heavy, rolling fog-wreaths lay low\nover the wet grey roofs of the Woolwich houses.  Down in the long,\nbrick-lined streets all was sodden and greasy and cheerless.  From the\nhigh dark buildings of the arsenal came the whirr of many wheels, the\nthudding of weights, and the buzz and babel of human toil.  Beyond, the\ndwellings of the workingmen, smoke-stained and unlovely, radiated away\nin a lessening perspective of narrowing road and dwindling wall.\n\nThere were few folk in the streets, for the toilers had all been\nabsorbed since break of day by the huge smoke-spouting monster, which\nsucked in the manhood of the town, to belch it forth weary and\nwork-stained every night.  Little groups of children straggled to\nschool, or loitered to peep through the single, front windows at the\nbig, gilt-edged Bibles, balanced upon small, three-legged tables, which\nwere their usual adornment.  Stout women, with thick, red arms and\ndirty aprons, stood upon the whitened doorsteps, leaning upon their\nbrooms, and shrieking their morning greetings across the road.  One\nstouter, redder, and dirtier than the rest, had gathered a small knot\nof cronies around her and was talking energetically, with little shrill\ntitters from her audience to punctuate her remarks.\n\n\"Old enough to know better!\" she cried, in answer to an exclamation\nfrom one of the listeners.  \"If he hain't no sense now, I 'specs he\nwon't learn much on this side o' Jordan.  Why, 'ow old is he at all?\nBlessed if I could ever make out.\"\n\n\"Well, it ain't so hard to reckon,\" said a sharp-featured pale-faced\nwoman with watery blue eyes.  \"He's been at the battle o' Waterloo, and\nhas the pension and medal to prove it.\"\n\n\"That were a ter'ble long time agone,\" remarked a third.  \"It were\nafore I were born.\"\n\n\"It were fifteen year after the beginnin' of the century,\" cried a\nyounger woman, who had stood leaning against the wall, with a smile of\nsuperior knowledge upon her face.  \"My Bill was a-saying so last\nSabbath, when I spoke to him o' old Daddy Brewster, here.\"\n\n\"And suppose he spoke truth, Missus Simpson, 'ow long agone do that\nmake it?\"\n\n\"It's eighty-one now,\" said the original speaker, checking off the\nyears upon her coarse red fingers, \"and that were fifteen.  Ten and\nten, and ten, and ten, and ten--why, it's only sixty-and-six year, so\nhe ain't so old after all.\"\n\n\"But he weren't a newborn babe at the battle, silly!\" cried the young\nwoman with a chuckle.  \"S'pose he were only twenty, then he couldn't be\nless than six-and-eighty now, at the lowest.\"\n\n\"Aye, he's that--every day of it,\" cried several.\n\n\"I've had 'bout enough of it,\" remarked the large woman gloomily.\n\"Unless his young niece, or grandniece, or whatever she is, come\nto-day, I'm off, and he can find some one else to do his work.  Your\nown 'ome first, says I.\"\n\n\"Ain't he quiet, then, Missus Simpson?\" asked the youngest of the group.\n\n\"Listen to him now,\" she answered, with her hand half raised and her\nhead turned slantwise towards the open door.  From the upper floor\nthere came a shuffling, sliding sound with a sharp tapping of a stick.\n\"There he go back and forrards, doing what he call his sentry go.  'Arf\nthe night through he's at that game, the silly old juggins.  At six\no'clock this very mornin there he was beatin' with a stick at my door.\n'Turn out, guard!' he cried, and a lot more jargon that I could make\nnothing of.  Then what with his coughin' and 'awkin' and spittin',\nthere ain't no gettin' a wink o' sleep.  Hark to him now!\"\n\n\"Missus Simpson, Missus Simpson!\" cried a cracked and querulous voice\nfrom above.\n\n\"That's him!\" she cried, nodding her head with an air of triumph.  \"He\ndo go on somethin' scandalous.  Yes, Mr. Brewster, sir.\"\n\n\"I want my morning ration, Missus Simpson.\"\n\n\"It's just ready, Mr. Brewster, sir.\"\n\n\"Blessed if he ain't like a baby cryin' for its pap,\" said the young\nwoman.\n\n\"I feel as if I could shake his old bones up sometimes!\" cried Mrs.\nSimpson viciously.  \"But who's for a 'arf of fourpenny?\"\n\nThe whole company were about to shuffle off to the public house, when a\nyoung girl stepped across the road and touched the housekeeper timidly\nupon the arm.  \"I think that is No. 56 Arsenal View,\" she said.  \"Can\nyou tell me if Mr. Brewster lives here?\"\n\nThe housekeeper looked critically at the newcomer.  She was a girl of\nabout twenty, broad-faced and comely, with a turned-up nose and large,\nhonest grey eyes.  Her print dress, her straw hat, with its bunch of\nglaring poppies, and the bundle she carried, had all a smack of the\ncountry.\n\n\"You're Norah Brewster, I s'pose,\" said Mrs. Simpson, eyeing her up and\ndown with no friendly gaze.\n\n\"Yes, I've come to look after my Granduncle Gregory.\"\n\n\"And a good job too,\" cried the housekeeper, with a toss of her head.\n\"It's about time that some of his own folk took a turn at it, for I've\nhad enough of it.  There you are, young woman!  In you go and make\nyourself at home.  There's tea in the caddy and bacon on the dresser,\nand the old man will be about you if you don't fetch him his breakfast.\nI'll send for my things in the evenin'.\"  With a nod she strolled off\nwith her attendant gossips in the direction of the public house.\n\nThus left to her own devices, the country girl walked into the front\nroom and took off her hat and jacket.  It was a low-roofed apartment\nwith a sputtering fire upon which a small brass kettle was singing\ncheerily.  A stained cloth lay over half the table, with an empty brown\nteapot, a loaf of bread, and some coarse crockery.  Norah Brewster\nlooked rapidly about her, and in an instant took over her new duties.\nEre five minutes had passed the tea was made, two slices of bacon were\nfrizzling on the pan, the table was rearranged, the antimacassars\nstraightened over the sombre brown furniture, and the whole room had\ntaken a new air of comfort and neatness.  This done she looked round\ncuriously at the prints upon the walls.  Over the fireplace, in a\nsmall, square case, a brown medal caught her eye, hanging from a strip\nof purple ribbon.  Beneath was a slip of newspaper cutting.  She stood\non her tiptoes, with her fingers on the edge of the mantelpiece, and\ncraned her neck up to see it, glancing down from time to time at the\nbacon which simmered and hissed beneath her.  The cutting was yellow\nwith age, and ran in this way:\n\n\"On Tuesday an interesting ceremony was performed at the barracks of\nthe Third Regiment of Guards, when, in the presence of the Prince\nRegent, Lord Hill, Lord Saltoun, and an assemblage which comprised\nbeauty as well as valour, a special medal was presented to Corporal\nGregory Brewster, of Captain Haldane's flank company, in recognition of\nhis gallantry in the recent great battle in the Lowlands.  It appears\nthat on the ever-memorable 18th of June four companies of the Third\nGuards and of the Coldstreams, under the command of Colonels Maitland\nand Byng, held the important farmhouse of Hougoumont at the right of\nthe British position.  At a critical point of the action these troops\nfound themselves short of powder.  Seeing that Generals Foy and Jerome\nBuonaparte were again massing their infantry for an attack on the\nposition, Colonel Byng dispatched Corporal Brewster to the rear to\nhasten up the reserve ammunition.  Brewster came upon two powder\ntumbrils of the Nassau division, and succeeded, after menacing the\ndrivers with his musket, in inducing them to convey their powder to\nHougoumont.  In his absence, however, the hedges surrounding the\nposition had been set on fire by a howitzer battery of the French, and\nthe passage of the carts full of powder became a most hazardous matter.\nThe first tumbril exploded, blowing the driver to fragments.  Daunted\nby the fate of his comrade, the second driver turned his horses, but\nCorporal Brewster, springing upon his seat, hurled the man down, and\nurging the powder cart through the flames, succeeded in forcing his way\nto his companions.  To this gallant deed may be directly attributed the\nsuccess of the British arms, for without powder it would have been\nimpossible to have held Hougoumont, and the Duke of Wellington had\nrepeatedly declared that had Hougoumont fallen, as well as La Haye\nSainte, he would have found it impossible to have held his ground.\nLong may the heroic Brewster live to treasure the medal which he has so\nbravely won, and to look back with pride to the day when, in the\npresence of his comrades, he received this tribute to his valour from\nthe august hands of the first gentleman of the realm.\"\n\nThe reading of this old cutting increased in the girl's mind the\nveneration which she had always had for her warrior kinsman.  From her\ninfancy he had been her hero, and she remembered how her father used to\nspeak of his courage and his strength, how he could strike down a\nbullock with a blow of his fist and carry a fat sheep under either arm.\nTrue, she had never seen him, but a rude painting at home which\ndepicted a square-faced, clean shaven, stalwart man with a great\nbearskin cap, rose ever before her memory when she thought of him.\n\nShe was still gazing at the brown medal and wondering what the \"Dulce\net decorum est\" might mean, which was inscribed upon the edge, when\nthere came a sudden tapping and shuffling upon the stair, and there at\nthe door was standing the very man who had been so often in her\nthoughts.\n\nBut could this indeed be he?  Where was the martial air, the flashing\neye, the warrior face which she had pictured?  There, framed in the\ndoorway, was a huge twisted old man, gaunt and puckered, with twitching\nhands and shuffling, purposeless feet.  A cloud of fluffy white hair, a\nred-veined nose, two thick tufts of eyebrow and a pair of dimly\nquestioning, watery blue eyes--these were what met her gaze.  He leaned\nforward upon a stick, while his shoulders rose and fell with his\ncrackling, rasping breathing.\n\n\"I want my morning rations,\" he crooned, as he stumped forward to his\nchair.  \"The cold nips me without 'em.  See to my fingers!\"  He held\nout his distorted hands, all blue at the tips, wrinkled and gnarled,\nwith huge, projecting knuckles.\n\n\"It's nigh ready,\" answered the girl, gazing at him with wonder in her\neyes.  \"Don't you know who I am, granduncle?  I am Norah Brewster from\nWitham.\"\n\n\"Rum is warm,\" mumbled the old man, rocking to and fro in his chair,\n\"and schnapps is warm, and there's 'eat in soup, but it's a dish o' tea\nfor me.  What did you say your name was?\"\n\n\"Norah Brewster.\"\n\n\"You can speak out, lass.  Seems to me folk's voices isn't as loud as\nthey used.\"\n\n\"I'm Norah Brewster, uncle.  I'm your grandniece come down from Essex\nway to live with you.\"\n\n\"You'll be brother Jarge's girl!  Lor, to think o' little Jarge having\na girl!\"  He chuckled hoarsely to himself, and the long, stringy sinews\nof his throat jerked and quivered.\n\n\"I am the daughter of your brother George's son,\" said she, as she\nturned the bacon.\n\n\"Lor, but little Jarge was a rare un!\" he continued.  \"Eh, by Jimini,\nthere was no chousing Jarge.  He's got a bull pup o' mine that I gave\nhim when I took the bounty.  You've heard him speak of it, likely?\"\n\n\"Why, grandpa George has been dead this twenty year,\" said she, pouring\nout the tea.\n\n\"Well, it was a bootiful pup--aye, a well-bred un, by Jimini!  I'm cold\nfor lack o' my rations.  Rum is good, and so is schnapps, but I'd as\nlief have tea as either.\"\n\nHe breathed heavily while he devoured his food.  \"It's a middlin'\ngoodish way you've come,\" said he at last.  \"Likely the stage left\nyesternight.\"\n\n\"The what, uncle?\"\n\n\"The coach that brought you.\"\n\n\"Nay, I came by the mornin' train.\"\n\n\"Lor, now, think o' that!  You ain't afeard o' those newfangled things!\nBy Jimini, to think of you comin' by railroad like that!  What's the\nworld a-comin' to!\"\n\nThere was silence for some minutes while Norah sat stirring her tea and\nglancing sideways at the bluish lips and champing jaws of her companion.\n\n\"You must have seen a deal o' life, uncle,\" said she.  \"It must seem a\nlong, long time to you!\"\n\n\"Not so very long neither.  I'm ninety, come Candlemas; but it don't\nseem long since I took the bounty.  And that battle, it might have been\nyesterday.  Eh, but I get a power o' good from my rations!\"  He did\nindeed look less worn and colourless than when she first saw him.  His\nface was flushed and his back more erect.\n\n\"Have you read that?\" he asked, jerking his head towards the cutting.\n\n\"Yes, uncle, and I'm sure you must be proud of it.\"\n\n\"Ah, it was a great day for me!  A great day!  The Regent was there,\nand a fine body of a man too!  'The ridgment is proud of you,' says he.\n'And I'm proud of the ridgment,' say I.  'A damned good answer too!'\nsays he to Lord Hill, and they both bu'st out a-laughin'.  But what be\nyou a-peepin' out o' the window for?\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle, here's a regiment of soldiers coming down the street with\nthe band playing in front of them.\"\n\n\"A ridgment, eh?  Where be my glasses?  Lor, but I can hear the band,\nas plain as plain!  Here's the pioneers an' the drum-major!  What be\ntheir number, lass?\"  His eyes were shining and his bony yellow\nfingers, like the claws of some fierce old bird, dug into her shoulder.\n\n\"They don't seem to have no number, uncle.  They've something wrote on\ntheir shoulders.  Oxfordshire, I think it be.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he growled.  \"I heard as they'd dropped the numbers and\ngiven them newfangled names.  There they go, by Jimini!  They're young\nmostly, but they hain't forgot how to march.  They have the swing-aye,\nI'll say that for them.  They've got the swing.\"  He gazed after them\nuntil the last files had turned the corner and the measured tramp of\ntheir marching had died away in the distance.\n\nHe had just regained his chair when the door opened and a gentleman\nstepped in.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Brewster!  Better to-day?\" he asked.\n\n\"Come in, doctor!  Yes, I'm better.  But there's a deal o' bubbling in\nmy chest.  It's all them toobes.  If I could but cut the phlegm, I'd be\nright.  Can't you give me something to cut the phlegm?\"\n\nThe doctor, a grave-faced young man, put his fingers to the furrowed,\nblue-corded wrist.\n\n\"You must be careful,\" he said.  \"You must take no liberties.\"  The\nthin tide of life seemed to thrill rather than to throb under his\nfinger.\n\nThe old man chuckled.\n\n\"I've got brother Jarge's girl to look after me now.  She'll see I\ndon't break barracks or do what I hadn't ought to.  Why, darn my skin,\nI knew something was amiss!\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"Why, with them soldiers.  You saw them pass, doctor--eh?  They'd\nforgot their stocks.  Not one on 'em had his stock on.\"  He croaked and\nchuckled for a long time over his discovery.  \"It wouldn't ha' done for\nthe Dook!\" he muttered.  \"No, by Jimini! the Dook would ha' had a word\nthere.\"\n\nThe doctor smiled.  \"Well, you are doing very well,\" said he.  \"I'll\nlook in once a week or so, and see how you are.\"  As Norah followed him\nto the door, he beckoned her outside.\n\n\"He is very weak,\" he whispered.  \"If you find him failing you must\nsend for me.\"\n\n\"What ails him, doctor?\"\n\n\"Ninety years ails him.  His arteries are pipes of lime.  His heart is\nshrunken and flabby.  The man is worn out.\"\n\nNorah stood watching the brisk figure of the young doctor, and\npondering over these new responsibilities which had come upon her.\nWhen she turned a tall, brown-faced artilleryman, with the three gold\nchevrons of sergeant upon his arm, was standing, carbine in hand, at\nher elbow.\n\n\"Good-morning, miss,\" said he, raising one thick finger to his jaunty,\nyellow-banded cap.  \"I b'lieve there's an old gentleman lives here of\nthe name of Brewster, who was engaged in the battle o' Waterloo?\"\n\n\"It's my granduncle, sir,\" said Norah, casting down her eyes before the\nkeen, critical gaze of the young soldier.  \"He is in the front parlour.\"\n\n\"Could I have a word with him, miss?  I'll call again if it don't\nchance to be convenient.\"\n\n\"I am sure that he would be very glad to see you, sir.  He's in here,\nif you'll step in.  Uncle, here's a gentleman who wants to speak with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Proud to see you, sir--proud and glad, sir,\" cried the sergeant,\ntaking three steps forward into the room, and grounding his carbine\nwhile he raised his hand, palm forwards, in a salute.  Norah stood by\nthe door, with her mouth and eyes open, wondering if her granduncle had\never, in his prime, looked like this magnificent creature, and whether\nhe, in his turn, would ever come to resemble her granduncle.\n\nThe old man blinked up at his visitor, and shook his head slowly.  \"Sit\nye down, sergeant,\" said he, pointing with his stick to a chair.\n\"You're full young for the stripes.  Lordy, it's easier to get three\nnow than one in my day.  Gunners were old soldiers then and the grey\nhairs came quicker than the three stripes.\"\n\n\"I am eight years' service, sir,\" cried the sergeant.  \"Macdonald is my\nname--Sergeant Macdonald, of H Battery, Southern Artillery Division.  I\nhave called as the spokesman of my mates at the gunner's barracks to\nsay that we are proud to have you in the town, sir.\"\n\nOld Brewster chuckled and rubbed his bony hands.  \"That were what the\nRegent said,\" he cried.  \"'The ridgment is proud of ye,' says he.  'And\nI am proud of the ridgment,' says I.  'And a damned good answer too,'\nsays he, and he and Lord Hill bu'st out a-laughin'.\"\n\n\"The non-commissioned mess would be proud and honoured to see you,\nsir,\" said Sergeant Macdonald; \"and if you could step as far you'll\nalways find a pipe o' baccy and a glass o' grog a-waitin' you.\"\n\nThe old man laughed until he coughed.  \"Like to see me, would they?\nThe dogs!\" said he.  \"Well, well, when the warm weather comes again\nI'll maybe drop in.  Too grand for a canteen, eh?  Got your mess just\nthe same as the orficers.  What's the world a-comin' to at all!\"\n\n\"You was in the line, sir, was you not?\" asked the sergeant\nrespectfully.\n\n\"The line?\" cried the old man, with shrill scorn.  \"Never wore a shako\nin my life.  I am a guardsman, I am.  Served in the Third Guards--the\nsame they call now the Scots Guards.  Lordy, but they have all marched\naway--every man of them--from old Colonel Byng down to the drummer\nboys, and here am I a straggler--that's what I am, sergeant, a\nstraggler!  I'm here when I ought to be there.  But it ain't my fault\nneither, for I'm ready to fall in when the word comes.\"\n\n\"We've all got to muster there,\" answered the sergeant.  \"Won't you try\nmy baccy, sir?\" handing over a sealskin pouch.\n\nOld Brewster drew a blackened clay pipe from his pocket, and began to\nstuff the tobacco into the bowl.  In an instant it slipped through his\nfingers, and was broken to pieces on the floor.  His lip quivered, his\nnose puckered up, and he began crying with the long, helpless sobs of a\nchild.  \"I've broke my pipe,\" he cried.\n\n\"Don't, uncle; oh, don't!\" cried Norah, bending over him, and patting\nhis white head as one soothes a baby.  \"It don't matter.  We can easy\nget another.\"\n\n\"Don't you fret yourself, sir,\" said the sergeant.  \"'Ere's a wooden\npipe with an amber mouth, if you'll do me the honour to accept it from\nme.  I'd be real glad if you will take it.\"\n\n\"Jimini!\" cried he, his smiles breaking in an instant through his\ntears.  \"It's a fine pipe.  See to my new pipe, Norah.  I lay that\nJarge never had a pipe like that.  You've got your firelock there,\nsergeant?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I was on my way back from the butts when I looked in.\"\n\n\"Let me have the feel of it.  Lordy, but it seems like old times to\nhave one's hand on a musket.  What's the manual, sergeant, eh?  Cock\nyour firelock--look to your priming--present your firelock--eh,\nsergeant?  Oh, Jimini, I've broke your musket in halves!\"\n\n\"That's all right, sir,\" cried the gunner laughing.  \"You pressed on\nthe lever and opened the breech-piece.  That's where we load 'em, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Load 'em at the wrong end!  Well, well, to think o' that!  And no\nramrod neither!  I've heard tell of it, but I never believed it afore.\nAh!  it won't come up to brown Bess.  When there's work to be done, you\nmark my word and see if they don't come back to brown Bess.\"\n\n\"By the Lord, sir!\" cried the sergeant hotly, \"they need some change\nout in South Africa now.  I see by this mornin's paper that the\nGovernment has knuckled under to these Boers.  They're hot about it at\nthe non-com. mess, I can tell you, sir.\"\n\n\"Eh--eh,\" croaked old Brewster.  \"By Jimini! it wouldn't ha' done for\nthe Dook; the Dook would ha' had a word to say over that.\"\n\n\"Ah, that he would, sir!\" cried the sergeant; \"and God send us another\nlike him.  But I've wearied you enough for one sitting.  I'll look in\nagain, and I'll bring a comrade or two with me, if I may, for there\nisn't one but would be proud to have speech with you.\"\n\nSo, with another salute to the veteran and a gleam of white teeth at\nNorah, the big gunner withdrew, leaving a memory of blue cloth and of\ngold braid behind him.  Many days had not passed, however, before he\nwas back again, and during all the long winter he was a frequent\nvisitor at Arsenal View.  There came a time, at last, when it might be\ndoubted to which of the two occupants his visits were directed, nor was\nit hard to say by which he was most anxiously awaited.  He brought\nothers with him; and soon, through all the lines, a pilgrimage to Daddy\nBrewster's came to be looked upon as the proper thing to do.  Gunners\nand sappers, linesmen and dragoons, came bowing and bobbing into the\nlittle parlour, with clatter of side arms and clink of spurs,\nstretching their long legs across the patchwork rug, and hunting in the\nfront of their tunics for the screw of tobacco or paper of snuff which\nthey had brought as a sign of their esteem.\n\nIt was a deadly cold winter, with six weeks on end of snow on the\nground, and Norah had a hard task to keep the life in that time-worn\nbody.  There were times when his mind would leave him, and when, save\nan animal outcry when the hour of his meals came round, no word would\nfall from him.  He was a white-haired child, with all a child's\ntroubles and emotions.  As the warm weather came once more, however,\nand the green buds peeped forth again upon the trees, the blood thawed\nin his veins, and he would even drag himself as far as the door to bask\nin the life-giving sunshine.\n\n\"It do hearten me up so,\" he said one morning, as he glowed in the hot\nMay sun.  \"It's a job to keep back the flies, though.  They get\nowdacious in this weather, and they do plague me cruel.\"\n\n\"I'll keep them off you, uncle,\" said Norah.\n\n\"Eh, but it's fine!  This sunshine makes me think o' the glory to come.\nYou might read me a bit o' the Bible, lass.  I find it wonderful\nsoothing.\"\n\n\"What part would you like, uncle?\"\n\n\"Oh, them wars.\"\n\n\"The wars?\"\n\n\"Aye, keep to the wars!  Give me the Old Testament for choice.  There's\nmore taste to it, to my mind.  When parson comes he wants to get off to\nsomething else; but it's Joshua or nothing with me.  Them Israelites\nwas good soldiers--good growed soldiers, all of 'em.\"\n\n\"But, uncle,\" pleaded Norah, \"it's all peace in the next world.\"\n\n\"No, it ain't, gal.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, uncle, surely!\"\n\nThe old corporal knocked his stick irritably upon the ground.  \"I tell\nye it ain't, gal.  I asked parson.\"\n\n\"Well, what did he say?\"\n\n\"He said there was to be a last fight.  He even gave it a name, he did.\nThe battle of Arm--Arm----\"\n\n\"Armageddon.\"\n\n\"Aye, that's the name parson said.  I 'specs the Third Guards'll be\nthere.  And the Dook--the Dook'll have a word to say.\"\n\nAn elderly, grey-whiskered gentleman had been walking down the street,\nglancing up at the numbers of the houses.  Now as his eyes fell upon\nthe old man, he came straight for him.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said he; \"perhaps you are Gregory Brewster?\"\n\n\"My name, sir,\" answered the veteran.\n\n\"You are the same Brewster, as I understand, who is on the roll of the\nScots Guards as having been present at the battle of Waterloo?\"\n\n\"I am that man, sir, though we called it the Third Guards in those\ndays.  It was a fine ridgment, and they only need me to make up a full\nmuster.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! they'll have to wait years for that,\" said the gentleman\nheartily.  \"But I am the colonel of the Scots Guards, and I thought I\nwould like to have a word with you.\"\n\nOld Gregory Brewster was up in an instant, with his hand to his\nrabbit-skin cap.  \"God bless me!\" he cried, \"to think of it! to think\nof it!\"\n\n\"Hadn't the gentleman better come in?\" suggested the practical Norah\nfrom behind the door.\n\n\"Surely, sir, surely; walk in, sir, if I may be so bold.\"  In his\nexcitement he had forgotten his stick, and as he led the way into the\nparlour his knees tottered, and he threw out his hands.  In an instant\nthe colonel had caught him on one side and Norah on the other.\n\n\"Easy and steady,\" said the colonel, as he led him to his armchair.\n\n\"Thank ye, sir; I was near gone that time.  But, Lordy I why, I can\nscarce believe it.  To think of me the corporal of the flank company\nand you the colonel of the battalion!  How things come round, to be\nsure!\"\n\n\"Why, we are very proud of you in London,\" said the colonel.  \"And so\nyou are actually one of the men who held Hougoumont.\"  He looked at the\nbony, trembling hands, with their huge, knotted knuckles, the stringy\nthroat, and the heaving, rounded shoulders.  Could this, indeed, be the\nlast of that band of heroes?  Then he glanced at the half-filled\nphials, the blue liniment bottles, the long-spouted kettle, and the\nsordid details of the sick room.  \"Better, surely, had he died under\nthe blazing rafters of the Belgian farmhouse,\" thought the colonel.\n\n\"I hope that you are pretty comfortable and happy,\" he remarked after a\npause.\n\n\"Thank ye, sir.  I have a good deal o' trouble with my toobes--a deal\no' trouble.  You wouldn't think the job it is to cut the phlegm.  And I\nneed my rations.  I gets cold without 'em.  And the flies!  I ain't\nstrong enough to fight against them.\"\n\n\"How's the memory?\" asked the colonel.\n\n\"Oh, there ain't nothing amiss there.  Why, sir, I could give you the\nname of every man in Captain Haldane's flank company.\"\n\n\"And the battle--you remember it?\"\n\n\"Why, I sees it all afore me every time I shuts my eyes.  Lordy, sir,\nyou wouldn't hardly believe how clear it is to me.  There's our line\nfrom the paregoric bottle right along to the snuff box.  D'ye see?\nWell, then, the pill box is for Hougoumont on the right--where we\nwas--and Norah's thimble for La Haye Sainte.  There it is, all right,\nsir; and here were our guns, and here behind the reserves and the\nBelgians.  Ach, them Belgians!\"  He spat furiously into the fire.\n\"Then here's the French, where my pipe lies; and over here, where I put\nmy baccy pouch, was the Proosians a-comin' up on our left flank.\nJimini, but it was a glad sight to see the smoke of their guns!\"\n\n\"And what was it that struck you most now in connection with the whole\naffair?\" asked the colonel.\n\n\"I lost three half-crowns over it, I did,\" crooned old Brewster.  \"I\nshouldn't wonder if I was never to get that money now.  I lent 'em to\nJabez Smith, my rear rank man, in Brussels.  'Only till pay-day, Grig,'\nsays he.  By Gosh! he was stuck by a lancer at Quatre Bras, and me with\nnot so much as a slip o' paper to prove the debt!  Them three\nhalf-crowns is as good as lost to me.\"\n\nThe colonel rose from his chair laughing.  \"The officers of the Guards\nwant you to buy yourself some little trifle which may add to your\ncomfort,\" he said.  \"It is not from me, so you need not thank me.\" He\ntook up the old man's tobacco pouch and slipped a crisp banknote inside\nit.\n\n\"Thank ye kindly, sir.  But there's one favour that I would like to ask\nyou, colonel.\"\n\n\"Yes, my man.\"\n\n\"If I'm called, colonel, you won't grudge me a flag and a firing party?\nI'm not a civilian; I'm a guardsman--I'm the last of the old Third\nGuards.\"\n\n\"All right, my man, I'll see to it,\" said the colonel.  \"Good-bye; I\nhope to have nothing but good news from you.\"\n\n\"A kind gentleman, Norah,\" croaked old Brewster, as they saw him walk\npast the window; \"but, Lordy, he ain't fit to hold the stirrup o' my\nColonel Byng!\"\n\nIt was on the very next day that the old corporal took a sudden change\nfor the worse.  Even the golden sunlight streaming through the window\nseemed unable to warm that withered frame.  The doctor came and shook\nhis head in silence.  All day the man lay with only his puffing blue\nlips and the twitching of his scraggy neck to show that he still held\nthe breath of life.  Norah and Sergeant Macdonald had sat by him in the\nafternoon, but he had shown no consciousness of their presence.  He lay\npeacefully, his eyes half closed, his hands under his cheek, as one who\nis very weary.\n\nThey had left him for an instant and were sitting in the front room,\nwhere Norah was preparing tea, when of a sudden they heard a shout that\nrang through the house.  Loud and clear and swelling, it pealed in\ntheir ears--a voice full of strength and energy and fiery passion.\n\"The Guards need powder!\" it cried; and yet again, \"The Guards need\npowder!\"\n\nThe sergeant sprang from his chair and rushed in, followed by the\ntrembling Norah.  There was the old man standing up, his blue eyes\nsparkling, his white hair bristling, his whole figure towering and\nexpanding, with eagle head and glance of fire.  \"The Guards need\npowder!\" he thundered once again, \"and, by God, they shall have it!\" He\nthrew up his long arms, and sank back with a groan into his chair.  The\nsergeant stooped over him,  and his face darkened.\n\n\"Oh, Archie, Archie,\" sobbed the frightened girl, \"what do you think of\nhim?\"\n\nThe sergeant turned away.  \"I think,\" said he, \"that the Third Guards\nhave a full muster now.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD GENERATION.\n\nScudamore Lane, sloping down riverwards from just behind the Monument,\nlies at night in the shadow of two black and monstrous walls which loom\nhigh above the glimmer of the scattered gas lamps.  The footpaths are\nnarrow, and the causeway is paved with rounded cobblestones, so that\nthe endless drays roar along it like breaking waves.  A few\nold-fashioned houses lie scattered among the business premises, and in\none of these, half-way down on the left-hand side, Dr. Horace Selby\nconducts his large practice.  It is a singular street for so big a man;\nbut a specialist who has an European reputation can afford to live\nwhere he likes.  In his particular branch, too, patients do not always\nregard seclusion as a disadvantage.\n\nIt was only ten o'clock.  The dull roar of the traffic which converged\nall day upon London Bridge had died away now to a mere confused murmur.\nIt was raining heavily, and the gas shone dimly through the streaked\nand dripping glass, throwing little circles upon the glistening\ncobblestones.  The air was full of the sounds of the rain, the thin\nswish of its fall, the heavier drip from the eaves, and the swirl and\ngurgle down the two steep gutters and through the sewer grating.  There\nwas only one figure in the whole length of Scudamore Lane.  It was that\nof a man, and it stood outside the door of Dr. Horace Selby.\n\nHe had just rung and was waiting for an answer.  The fanlight beat full\nupon the gleaming shoulders of his waterproof and upon his upturned\nfeatures.  It was a wan, sensitive, clear-cut face, with some subtle,\nnameless peculiarity in its expression, something of the startled horse\nin the white-rimmed eye, something too of the helpless child in the\ndrawn cheek and the weakening of the lower lip.  The man-servant knew\nthe stranger as a patient at a bare glance at those frightened eyes.\nSuch a look had been seen at that door many times before.\n\n\"Is the doctor in?\"\n\nThe man hesitated.\n\n\"He has had a few friends to dinner, sir.  He does not like to be\ndisturbed outside his usual hours, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell him that I MUST see him.  Tell him that it is of the very first\nimportance.  Here is my card.\"  He fumbled with his trembling fingers\nin trying to draw one from his case.  \"Sir Francis Norton is the name.\nTell him that Sir Francis Norton, of Deane Park, must see him without\ndelay.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  The butler closed his fingers upon the card and the\nhalf-sovereign which accompanied it.  \"Better hang your coat up here in\nthe hall.  It is very wet.  Now if you will wait here in the\nconsulting-room, I have no doubt that I shall be able to send the\ndoctor in to you.\"\n\nIt was a large and lofty room in which the young baronet found himself.\nThe carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he\nwalked across it.  The two gas jets were turned only half-way up, and\nthe dim light with the faint aromatic smell which filled the air had a\nvaguely religious suggestion.  He sat down in a shining leather\narmchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him.  Two\nsides of the room were taken up with books, fat and sombre, with broad\ngold lettering upon their backs.  Beside him was the high,\nold-fashioned mantelpiece of white marble--the top of it strewed with\ncotton wadding and bandages, graduated measures, and little bottles.\nThere was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone,\nand another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken\npipestem and \"Caustic\" outside upon a red label.  Thermometers,\nhypodermic syringes bistouries and spatulas were scattered about both\non the mantelpiece and on the central table on either side of the\nsloping desk.  On the same table, to the right, stood copies of the\nfive books which Dr. Horace Selby had written upon the subject with\nwhich his name is peculiarly associated, while on the left, on the top\nof a red medical directory, lay a huge glass model of a human eye the\nsize of a turnip, which opened down the centre to expose the lens and\ndouble chamber within.\n\nSir Francis Norton had never been remarkable for his powers of\nobservation, and yet he found himself watching these trifles with the\nkeenest attention.  Even the corrosion of the cork of an acid bottle\ncaught his eye, and he wondered that the doctor did not use glass\nstoppers.  Tiny scratches where the light glinted off from the table,\nlittle stains upon the leather of the desk, chemical formulae scribbled\nupon the labels of the phials--nothing was too slight to arrest his\nattention.  And his sense of hearing was equally alert.  The heavy\nticking of the solemn black clock above the mantelpiece struck quite\npainfully upon his ears.  Yet in spite of it, and in spite also of the\nthick, old-fashioned wooden partition, he could hear voices of men\ntalking in the next room, and could even catch scraps of their\nconversation.  \"Second hand was bound to take it.\" \"Why, you drew the\nlast of them yourself!\"\n\n\"How could I play the queen when I knew that the ace was against me?\"\nThe phrases came in little spurts falling back into the dull murmur of\nconversation.  And then suddenly he heard the creaking of a door and a\nstep in the hall, and knew with a tingling mixture of impatience and\nhorror that the crisis of his life was at hand.\n\nDr. Horace Selby was a large, portly man with an imposing presence.\nHis nose and chin were bold and pronounced, yet his features were\npuffy, a combination which would blend more freely with the wig and\ncravat of the early Georges than with the close-cropped hair and black\nfrock-coat of the end of the nineteenth century.  He was clean shaven,\nfor his mouth was too good to cover--large, flexible, and sensitive,\nwith a kindly human softening at either corner which with his brown\nsympathetic eyes had drawn out many a shame-struck sinner's secret.\nTwo masterful little bushy side-whiskers bristled out from under his\nears spindling away upwards to merge in the thick curves of his\nbrindled hair.  To his patients there was something reassuring in the\nmere bulk and dignity of the man.  A high and easy bearing in medicine\nas in war bears with it a hint of victories in the past, and a promise\nof others to come.  Dr. Horace Selby's face was a consolation, and so\ntoo were the large, white, soothing hands, one of which he held out to\nhis visitor.\n\n\"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.  It is a conflict of duties, you\nperceive--a host's to his guests and an adviser's to his patient.  But\nnow I am entirely at your disposal, Sir Francis.  But dear me, you are\nvery cold.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am cold.\"\n\n\"And you are trembling all over.  Tut, tut, this will never do!  This\nmiserable night has chilled you.  Perhaps some little stimulant----\"\n\n\"No, thank you.  I would really rather not.  And it is not the night\nwhich has chilled me.  I am frightened, doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor half-turned in his chair, and he patted the arch of the\nyoung man's knee, as he might the neck of a restless horse.\n\n\"What then?\" he asked, looking over his shoulder at the pale face with\nthe startled eyes.\n\nTwice the young man parted his lips.  Then he stooped with a sudden\ngesture, and turning up the right leg of his trousers he pulled down\nhis sock and thrust forward his shin.  The doctor made a clicking noise\nwith his tongue as he glanced at it.\n\n\"Both legs?\"\n\n\"No, only one.\"\n\n\"Suddenly?\"\n\n\"This morning.\"\n\n\"Hum.\"\n\nThe doctor pouted his lips, and drew his finger and thumb down the line\nof his chin.  \"Can you account for it?\" he asked briskly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nA trace of sternness came into the large brown eyes.\n\n\"I need not point out to you that unless the most absolute\nfrankness----\"\n\nThe patient sprang from his chair.  \"So help me God!\" he cried, \"I have\nnothing in my life with which to reproach myself.  Do you think that I\nwould be such a fool as to come here and tell you lies.  Once for all,\nI have nothing to regret.\"  He was a pitiful, half-tragic and\nhalf-grotesque figure, as he stood with one trouser leg rolled to the\nknee, and that ever present horror still lurking in his eyes.  A burst\nof merriment came from the card-players in the next room, and the two\nlooked at each other in silence.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said the doctor abruptly, \"your assurance is quite\nsufficient.\"  He stooped and ran his finger down the line of the young\nman's shin, raising it at one point.  \"Hum, serpiginous,\" he murmured,\nshaking his head.  \"Any other symptoms?\"\n\n\"My eyes have been a little weak.\"\n\n\"Let me see your teeth.\"  He glanced at them, and again made the\ngentle, clicking sound of sympathy and disapprobation.\n\n\"Now your eye.\"  He lit a lamp at the patient's elbow, and holding a\nsmall crystal lens to concentrate the light, he threw it obliquely upon\nthe patient's eye.  As he did so a glow of pleasure came over his large\nexpressive face, a flush of such enthusiasm as the botanist feels when\nhe packs the rare plant into his tin knapsack, or the astronomer when\nthe long-sought comet first swims into the field of his telescope.\n\n\"This is very typical--very typical indeed,\" he murmured, turning to\nhis desk and jotting down a few memoranda upon a sheet of paper.\n\"Curiously enough, I am writing a monograph upon the subject.  It is\nsingular that you should have been able to furnish so well-marked a\ncase.\"  He had so forgotten the patient in his symptom, that he had\nassumed an almost congratulatory air towards its possessor.  He\nreverted to human sympathy again, as his patient asked for particulars.\n\n\"My dear sir, there is no occasion for us to go into strictly\nprofessional details together,\" said he soothingly.  \"If, for example,\nI were to say that you have interstitial keratitis, how would you be\nthe wiser?  There are indications of a strumous diathesis.  In broad\nterms, I may say that you have a constitutional and hereditary taint.\"\n\nThe young baronet sank back in his chair, and his chin fell forwards\nupon his chest.  The doctor sprang to a side-table and poured out half\na glass of liqueur brandy which he held to his patient's lips.  A\nlittle fleck of colour came into his cheeks as he drank it down.\n\n\"Perhaps I spoke a little abruptly,\" said the doctor, \"but you must\nhave known the nature of your complaint.  Why, otherwise, should you\nhave come to me?\"\n\n\"God help me, I suspected it; but only today when my leg grew bad.  My\nfather had a leg like this.\"\n\n\"It was from him, then----?\"\n\n\"No, from my grandfather.  You have heard of Sir Rupert Norton, the\ngreat Corinthian?\"\n\nThe doctor was a man of wide reading with a retentive, memory.  The\nname brought back instantly to him the remembrance of the sinister\nreputation of its owner--a notorious buck of the thirties--who had\ngambled and duelled and steeped himself in drink and debauchery, until\neven the vile set with whom he consorted had shrunk away from him in\nhorror, and left him to a sinister old age with the barmaid wife whom\nhe had married in some drunken frolic.  As he looked at the young man\nstill leaning back in the leather chair, there seemed for the instant\nto flicker up behind him some vague presentiment of that foul old dandy\nwith his dangling seals, many-wreathed scarf, and dark satyric face.\nWhat was he now?  An armful of bones in a mouldy box.  But his deeds--\nthey were living and rotting the blood in the veins of an innocent man.\n\n\"I see that you have heard of him,\" said the young baronet.  \"He died\nhorribly, I have been told; but not more horribly than he had lived.\nMy father was his only son.  He was a studious man, fond of books and\ncanaries and the country; but his innocent life did not save him.\"\n\n\"His symptoms were cutaneous, I understand.\"\n\n\"He wore gloves in the house.  That was the first thing I can remember.\nAnd then it was his throat.  And then his legs.  He used to ask me so\noften about my own health, and I thought him so fussy, for how could I\ntell what the meaning of it was.  He was always watching me--always\nwith a sidelong eye fixed upon me.  Now, at last, I know what he was\nwatching for.\"\n\n\"Had you brothers or sisters?\"\n\n\"None, thank God.\"\n\n\"Well, well, it is a sad case, and very typical of many which come in\nmy way.  You are no lonely sufferer, Sir Francis.  There are many\nthousands who bear the same cross as you do.\"\n\n\"But where is the justice of it, doctor?\" cried the young man,\nspringing from his chair and pacing up and down the consulting-room.\n\"If I were heir to my grandfather's sins as well as to their results, I\ncould understand it, but I am of my father's type.  I love all that is\ngentle and beautiful--music and poetry and art.  The coarse and animal\nis abhorrent to me.  Ask any of my friends and they would tell you\nthat.  And now that this vile, loathsome thing--ach, I am polluted to\nthe marrow, soaked in abomination!  And why?  Haven't I a right to ask\nwhy?  Did I do it?  Was it my fault?  Could I help being born?  And\nlook at me now, blighted and blasted, just as life was at its sweetest.\nTalk about the sins of the father--how about the sins of the Creator?\"\nHe shook his two clinched hands in the air--the poor impotent atom with\nhis pin-point of brain caught in the whirl of the infinite.\n\nThe doctor rose and placing his hands upon his shoulders he pressed him\nback into his chair once more.  \"There, there, my dear lad,\" said he;\n\"you must not excite yourself.  You are trembling all over.  Your\nnerves cannot stand it.  We must take these great questions upon trust.\nWhat are we, after all?  Half-evolved creatures in a transition stage,\nnearer perhaps to the Medusa on the one side than to perfected humanity\non the other.  With half a complete brain we can't expect to understand\nthe whole of a complete fact, can we, now?  It is all very dim and\ndark, no doubt; but I think that Pope's famous couplet sums up the\nwhole matter, and from my heart, after fifty years of varied\nexperience, I can say----\"\n\nBut the young baronet gave a cry of impatience and disgust.  \"Words,\nwords, words!  You can sit comfortably there in your chair and say\nthem--and think them too, no doubt.  You've had your life, but I've\nnever had mine.  You've healthy blood in your veins; mine is putrid.\nAnd yet I am as innocent as you.  What would words do for you if you\nwere in this chair and I in that?  Ah, it's such a mockery and a\nmake-believe!  Don't think me rude, though, doctor.  I don't mean to be\nthat.  I only say that it is impossible for you or any other man to\nrealise it.  But I've a question to ask you, doctor.  It's one on which\nmy whole life must depend.\"  He writhed his fingers together in an\nagony of apprehension.\n\n\"Speak out, my dear sir.  I have every sympathy with you.\"\n\n\"Do you think--do you think the poison has spent itself on me?  Do you\nthink that if I had children they would suffer?\"\n\n\"I can only give one answer to that.  'The third and fourth\ngeneration,' says the trite old text.  You may in time eliminate it\nfrom your system, but many years must pass before you can think of\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"I am to be married on Tuesday,\" whispered the patient.\n\nIt was the doctor's turn to be thrilled with horror.  There were not\nmany situations which would yield such a sensation to his seasoned\nnerves.  He sat in silence while the babble of the card-table broke in\nupon them again.  \"We had a double ruff if you had returned a heart.\"\n\"I was bound to clear the trumps.\"  They were hot and angry about it.\n\n\"How could you?\" cried the doctor severely.  \"It was criminal.\"\n\n\"You forget that I have only learned how I stand to-day.\"  He put his\ntwo hands to his temples and pressed them convulsively.  \"You are a man\nof the world, Dr. Selby.  You have seen or heard of such things before.\nGive me some advice.  I'm in your hands.  It is all very sudden and\nhorrible, and I don't think I am strong enough to bear it.\"\n\nThe doctor's heavy brows thickened into two straight lines, and he bit\nhis nails in perplexity.\n\n\"The marriage must not take place.\"\n\n\"Then what am I to do?\"\n\n\"At all costs it must not take place.\"\n\n\"And I must give her up?\"\n\n\"There can be no question about that.\"\n\nThe young man took out a pocketbook and drew from it a small\nphotograph, holding it out towards the doctor.  The firm face softened\nas he looked at it.\n\n\"It is very hard on you, no doubt.  I can appreciate it more now that I\nhave seen that.  But there is no alternative at all.  You must give up\nall thought of it.\"\n\n\"But this is madness, doctor--madness, I tell you.  No, I won't raise\nmy voice.  I forgot myself.  But realise it, man.  I am to be married\non Tuesday.  This coming Tuesday, you understand.  And all the world\nknows it.  How can I put such a public affront upon her.  It would be\nmonstrous.\"\n\n\"None the less it must be done.  My dear lad, there is no way out of\nit.\"\n\n\"You would have me simply write brutally and break the engagement at\nthe last moment without a reason.  I tell you I couldn't do it.\"\n\n\"I had a patient once who found himself in a somewhat similar situation\nsome years ago,\" said the doctor thoughtfully.  \"His device was a\nsingular one.  He deliberately committed a penal offence, and so\ncompelled the young lady's people to withdraw their consent to the\nmarriage.\"\n\nThe young baronet shook his head.  \"My personal honour is as yet\nunstained,\" said he.  \"I have little else left, but that, at least, I\nwill preserve.\"\n\n\"Well, well, it is a nice dilemma, and the choice lies with you.\"\n\n\"Have you no other suggestion?\"\n\n\"You don't happen to have property in Australia?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"But you have capital?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you could buy some.  To-morrow morning would do.  A thousand\nmining shares would be enough.  Then you might write to say that urgent\nbusiness affairs have compelled you to start at an hour's notice to\ninspect your property.  That would give you six months, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Well, that would be possible.  Yes, certainly, it would be possible.\nBut think of her position.  The house full of wedding presents--guests\ncoming from a distance.  It is awful.  And you say that there is no\nalternative.\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, then, I might write it now, and start to-morrow--eh?  Perhaps\nyou would let me use your desk.  Thank you.  I am so sorry to keep you\nfrom your guests so long.  But I won't be a moment now.\"\n\nHe wrote an abrupt note of a few lines.  Then with a sudden impulse he\ntore it to shreds and flung it into the fireplace.\n\n\"No, I can't sit down and tell her a lie, doctor,\" he said rising.  \"We\nmust find some other way out of this.  I will think it over and let you\nknow my decision.  You must allow me to double your fee as I have taken\nsuch an unconscionable time.  Now good-bye, and thank you a thousand\ntimes for your sympathy and advice.\"\n\n\"Why, dear me, you haven't even got your prescription yet.  This is the\nmixture, and I should recommend one of these powders every morning, and\nthe chemist will put all directions upon the ointment box.  You are\nplaced in a cruel situation, but I trust that these may be but passing\nclouds.  When may I hope to hear from you again?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Very good.  How the rain is splashing in the street!  You have your\nwaterproof there.  You will need it.  Good-bye, then, until to-morrow.\"\n\nHe opened the door.  A gust of cold, damp air swept into the hall.  And\nyet the doctor stood for a minute or more watching the lonely figure\nwhich passed slowly through the yellow splotches of the gas lamps, and\ninto the broad bars of darkness between.  It was but his own shadow\nwhich trailed up the wall as he passed the lights, and yet it looked to\nthe doctor's eye as though some huge and sombre figure walked by a\nmanikin's side and led him silently up the lonely street.\n\nDr. Horace Selby heard again of his patient next morning, and rather\nearlier than he had expected.  A paragraph in the Daily News caused him\nto push away his breakfast untasted, and turned him sick and faint\nwhile he read it.  \"A Deplorable Accident,\" it was headed, and it ran\nin this way:\n\n\"A fatal accident of a peculiarly painful character is reported from\nKing William Street.  About eleven o'clock last night a young man was\nobserved while endeavouring to get out of the way of a hansom to slip\nand fall under the wheels of a heavy, two-horse dray.  On being picked\nup his injuries were found to be of the most shocking character, and he\nexpired while being conveyed to the hospital.  An examination of his\npocketbook and cardcase shows beyond any question that the deceased is\nnone other than Sir Francis Norton, of Deane Park, who has only within\nthe last year come into the baronetcy.  The accident is made the more\ndeplorable as the deceased, who was only just of age, was on the eve of\nbeing married to a young lady belonging to one of the oldest families\nin the South.  With his wealth and his talents the ball of fortune was\nat his feet, and his many friends will be deeply grieved to know that\nhis promising career has been cut short in so sudden and tragic a\nfashion.\"\n\n\n\n\nA FALSE START.\n\n\"Is Dr. Horace Wilkinson at home?\"\n\n\"I am he.  Pray step in.\"\n\nThe visitor looked somewhat astonished at having the door opened to him\nby the master of the house.\n\n\"I wanted to have a few words.\"\n\nThe doctor, a pale, nervous young man, dressed in an\nultra-professional, long black frock-coat, with a high, white collar\ncutting off his dapper side-whiskers in the centre, rubbed his hands\ntogether and smiled.  In the thick, burly man in front of him he\nscented a patient, and it would be his first.  His scanty resources had\nbegun to run somewhat low, and, although he had his first quarter's\nrent safely locked away in the right-hand drawer of his desk, it was\nbecoming a question with him how he should meet the current expenses of\nhis very simple housekeeping.  He bowed, therefore, waved his visitor\nin, closed the hall door in a careless fashion, as though his own\npresence thereat had been a purely accidental circumstance, and finally\nled the burly stranger into his scantily furnished front room, where he\nmotioned him to a seat.  Dr. Wilkinson planted himself behind his desk,\nand, placing his finger-tips together, he gazed with some apprehension\nat his companion.  What was the matter with the man?  He seemed very\nred in the face.  Some of his old professors would have diagnosed his\ncase by now, and would have electrified the patient by describing his\nown symptoms before he had said a word about them.  Dr. Horace\nWilkinson racked his brains for some clue, but Nature had fashioned him\nas a plodder--a very reliable plodder and nothing more.  He could think\nof nothing save that the visitor's watch-chain had a very brassy\nappearance, with a corollary to the effect that he would be lucky if he\ngot half-a-crown out of him.  Still, even half-a-crown was something in\nthose early days of struggle.\n\nWhilst the doctor had been running his eyes over the stranger, the\nlatter had been plunging his hands into pocket after pocket of his\nheavy coat.  The heat of the weather, his dress, and this exercise of\npocket-rummaging had all combined to still further redden his face,\nwhich had changed from brick to beet, with a gloss of moisture on his\nbrow.  This extreme ruddiness brought a clue at last to the observant\ndoctor.  Surely it was not to be attained without alcohol.  In alcohol\nlay the secret of this man's trouble.  Some little delicacy was needed,\nhowever, in showing him that he had read his case aright--that at a\nglance he had penetrated to the inmost sources of his ailments.\n\n\"It's very hot,\" observed the stranger, mopping his forehead.\n\n\"Yes, it is weather which tempts one to drink rather more beer than is\ngood for one,\" answered Dr. Horace Wilkinson, looking very knowingly at\nhis companion from over his finger-tips.\n\n\"Dear, dear, you shouldn't do that.\"\n\n\"I!  I never touch beer.\"\n\n\"Neither do I.  I've been an abstainer for twenty years.\"\n\nThis was depressing.  Dr. Wilkinson blushed until he was nearly as red\nas the other.  \"May I ask what I can do for you?\" he asked, picking up\nhis stethoscope and tapping it gently against his thumb-nail.\n\n\"Yes, I was just going to tell you.  I heard of your coming, but I\ncouldn't get round before----\"  He broke into a nervous little cough.\n\n\"Yes?\" said the doctor encouragingly.\n\n\"I should have been here three weeks ago, but you know how these things\nget put off.\"  He coughed again behind his large red hand.\n\n\"I do not think that you need say anything more,\" said the doctor,\ntaking over the case with an easy air of command.  \"Your cough is quite\nsufficient.  It is entirely bronchial by the sound.  No doubt the\nmischief is circumscribed at present, but there is always the danger\nthat it may spread, so you have done wisely to come to me.  A little\njudicious treatment will soon set you right.  Your waistcoat, please,\nbut not your shirt.  Puff out your chest and say ninety-nine in a deep\nvoice.\"\n\nThe red-faced man began to laugh.  \"It's all right, doctor,\" said he.\n\"That cough comes from chewing tobacco, and I know it's a very bad\nhabit.  Nine-and-ninepence is what I have to say to you, for I'm the\nofficer of the gas company, and they have a claim against you for that\non the metre.\"\n\nDr. Horace Wilkinson collapsed into his chair.  \"Then you're not a\npatient?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Never needed a doctor in my life, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right.\"  The doctor concealed his disappointment under\nan affectation of facetiousness.  \"You don't look as if you troubled\nthem much.  I don't know what we should do if every one were as robust.\nI shall call at the company's offices and pay this small amount.\"\n\n\"If you could make it convenient, sir, now that I am here, it would\nsave trouble----\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\"  These eternal little sordid money troubles were more\ntrying to the doctor than plain living or scanty food.  He took out his\npurse and slid the contents on to the table.  There were two\nhalf-crowns and some pennies.  In his drawer he had ten golden\nsovereigns.  But those were his rent.  If he once broke in upon them he\nwas lost.  He would starve first.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said he, with a smile, as at some strange, unheard-of\nincident.  \"I have run short of small change.  I am afraid I shall have\nto call upon the company, after all.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" The inspector rose, and with a practised glance\naround, which valued every article in the room, from the two-guinea\ncarpet to the eight-shilling muslin curtains, he took his departure.\n\nWhen he had gone Dr. Wilkinson rearranged his room, as was his habit a\ndozen times in the day.  He laid out his large Quain's Dictionary of\nMedicine in the forefront of the table so as to impress the casual\npatient that he had ever the best authorities at his elbow.  Then he\ncleared all the little instruments out of his pocket-case--the\nscissors, the forceps, the bistouries, the lancets--and he laid them\nall out beside the stethoscope, to make as good a show as possible.\nHis ledger, day-book, and visiting-book were spread in front of him.\nThere was no entry in any of them yet, but it would not look well to\nhave the covers too glossy and new, so he rubbed them together and\ndaubed ink over them.  Neither would it be well that any patient should\nobserve that his name was the first in the book, so he filled up the\nfirst page of each with notes of imaginary visits paid to nameless\npatients during the last three weeks.  Having done all this, he rested\nhis head upon his hands and relapsed into the terrible occupation of\nwaiting.\n\nTerrible enough at any time to the young professional man, but most of\nall to one who knows that the weeks, and even the days during which he\ncan hold out are numbered.  Economise as he would, the money would\nstill slip away in the countless little claims which a man never\nunderstands until he lives under a rooftree of his own.  Dr. Wilkinson\ncould not deny, as he sat at his desk and looked at the little heap of\nsilver and coppers, that his chances of being a successful practitioner\nin Sutton were rapidly vanishing away.\n\nAnd yet it was a bustling, prosperous town, with so much money in it\nthat it seemed strange that a man with a trained brain and dexterous\nfingers should be starved out of it for want of employment.  At his\ndesk, Dr. Horace Wilkinson could see the never-ending double current of\npeople which ebbed and flowed in front of his window.  It was a busy\nstreet, and the air was forever filled with the dull roar of life, the\ngrinding of the wheels, and the patter of countless feet.  Men, women,\nand children, thousands and thousands of them passed in the day, and\nyet each was hurrying on upon his own business, scarce glancing at the\nsmall brass plate, or wasting a thought upon the man who waited in the\nfront room.  And yet how many of them would obviously, glaringly have\nbeen the better for his professional assistance.  Dyspeptic men, anemic\nwomen, blotched faces, bilious complexions--they flowed past him, they\nneeding him, he needing them, and yet the remorseless bar of\nprofessional etiquette kept them forever apart.  What could he do?\nCould he stand at his own front door, pluck the casual stranger by the\nsleeve, and whisper in his ear, \"Sir, you will forgive me for remarking\nthat you are suffering from a severe attack of acne rosacea, which\nmakes you a peculiarly unpleasant object.  Allow me to suggest that a\nsmall prescription containing arsenic, which will not cost you more\nthan you often spend upon a single meal, will be very much to your\nadvantage.\"  Such an address would be a degradation to the high and\nlofty profession of Medicine, and there are no such sticklers for the\nethics of that profession as some to whom she has been but a bitter and\na grudging mother.\n\nDr. Horace Wilkinson was still looking moodily out of the window, when\nthere came a sharp clang at the bell.  Often it had rung, and with\nevery ring his hopes had sprung up, only to dwindle away again, and\nchange to leaden disappointment, as he faced some beggar or touting\ntradesman.  But the doctor's spirit was young and elastic, and again,\nin spite of all experience, it responded to that exhilarating summons.\nHe sprang to his feet, cast his eyes over the table, thrust out his\nmedical books a little more prominently, and hurried to the door.  A\ngroan escaped him as he entered the hall.  He could see through the\nhalf-glazed upper panels that a gypsy van, hung round with wicker\ntables and chairs, had halted before his door, and that a couple of the\nvagrants, with a baby, were waiting outside.  He had learned by\nexperience that it was better not even to parley with such people.\n\n\"I have nothing for you,\" said he, loosing the latch by an inch.  \"Go\naway!\"\n\nHe closed the door, but the bell clanged once more.  \"Get away!  Get\naway!\" he cried impatiently, and walked back into his consulting-room.\nHe had hardly seated himself when the bell went for the third time.  In\na towering passion he rushed back, flung open the door.\n\n\"What the----?\"\n\n\"If you please, sir, we need a doctor.\"\n\nIn an instant he was rubbing his hands again with his blandest\nprofessional smile.  These were patients, then, whom he had tried to\nhunt from his doorstep--the very first patients, whom he had waited for\nso impatiently.  They did not look very promising.  The man, a tall,\nlank-haired gypsy, had gone back to the horse's head.  There remained a\nsmall, hard-faced woman with a great bruise all round her eye.  She\nwore a yellow silk handkerchief round her head, and a baby, tucked in a\nred shawl, was pressed to her bosom.\n\n\"Pray step in, madam,\" said Dr. Horace Wilkinson, with his very best\nsympathetic manner.  In this case, at least, there could be no mistake\nas to diagnosis.  \"If you will sit on this sofa, I shall very soon make\nyou feel much more comfortable.\"\n\nHe poured a little water from his carafe into a saucer, made a compress\nof lint, fastened it over the injured eye, and secured the whole with a\nspica bandage, secundum artem.\n\n\"Thank ye kindly, sir,\" said the woman, when his work was finished;\n\"that's nice and warm, and may God bless your honour.  But it wasn't\nabout my eye at all that I came to see a doctor.\"\n\n\"Not your eye?\" Dr. Horace Wilkinson was beginning to be a little\ndoubtful as to the advantages of quick diagnosis.  It is an excellent\nthing to be able to surprise a patient, but hitherto it was always the\npatient who had surprised him.\n\n\"The baby's got the measles.\"\n\nThe mother parted the red shawl, and exhibited a little dark,\nblack-eyed gypsy baby, whose swarthy face was all flushed and mottled\nwith a dark-red rash.  The child breathed with a rattling sound, and it\nlooked up at the doctor with eyes which were heavy with want of sleep\nand crusted together at the lids.\n\n\"Hum!  Yes.  Measles, sure enough--and a smart attack.\"\n\n\"I just wanted you to see her, sir, so that you could signify.\"\n\n\"Could what?\"\n\n\"Signify, if anything happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see--certify.\"\n\n\"And now that you've seen it, sir, I'll go on, for Reuben--that's my\nman--is in a hurry.\"\n\n\"But don't you want any medicine?\"\n\n\"Oh, now you've seen it, it's all right.  I'll let you know if anything\nhappens.\"\n\n\"But you must have some medicine.  The child is very ill.\"  He\ndescended into the little room which he had fitted as a surgery, and he\nmade up a two-ounce bottle of cooling medicine.  In such cities as\nSutton there are few patients who can afford to pay a fee to both\ndoctor and chemist, so that unless the physician is prepared to play\nthe part of both he will have little chance of making a living at\neither.\n\n\"There is your medicine, madam.  You will find the directions upon the\nbottle.  Keep the child warm and give it a light diet.\"\n\n\"Thank you kindly, sir.\" She shouldered her baby and marched for the\ndoor.\n\n\"Excuse me, madam,\" said the doctor nervously.  \"Don't you think it too\nsmall a matter to make a bill of?  Perhaps it would be better if we had\na settlement at once.\"\n\nThe gypsy woman looked at him reproachfully out of her one uncovered\neye.\n\n\"Are you going to charge me for that?\" she asked.  \"How much, then?\"\n\n\"Well, say half-a-crown.\"  He mentioned the sum in a half-jesting way,\nas though it were too small to take serious notice of, but the gypsy\nwoman raised quite a scream at the mention of it.\n\n\"'Arf-a-crown! for that?\"\n\n\"Well, my good woman, why not go to the poor doctor if you cannot\nafford a fee?\"\n\nShe fumbled in her pocket, craning awkwardly to keep her grip upon the\nbaby.\n\n\"Here's sevenpence,\" she said at last, holding out a little pile of\ncopper coins.  \"I'll give you that and a wicker footstool.\"\n\n\"But my fee is half-a-crown.\"  The doctor's views of the glory of his\nprofession cried out against this wretched haggling, and yet what was\nhe to do?  \"Where am I to get 'arf-a-crown?  It is well for gentlefolk\nlike you who sit in your grand houses, and can eat and drink what you\nlike, an' charge 'arf-a-crown for just saying as much as, ''Ow d'ye\ndo?'  We can't pick up' arf-crowns like that.  What we gets we earns\n'ard.  This sevenpence is just all I've got.  You told me to feed the\nchild light.  She must feed light, for what she's to have is more than\nI know.\"\n\nWhilst the woman had been speaking, Dr. Horace Wilkinson's eyes had\nwandered to the tiny heap of money upon the table, which represented\nall that separated him from absolute starvation, and he chuckled to\nhimself at the grim joke that he should appear to this poor woman to be\na being living in the lap of luxury.  Then he picked up the odd\ncoppers, leaving only the two half-crowns upon the table.\n\n\"Here you are,\" he said brusquely.  \"Never mind the fee, and take these\ncoppers.  They may be of some use to you.  Good-bye!\"  He bowed her\nout, and closed the door behind her.  After all she was the thin edge\nof the wedge.  These wandering people have great powers of\nrecommendation.  All large practices have been built up from such\nfoundations.  The hangers-on to the kitchen recommend to the kitchen,\nthey to the drawing-room, and so it spreads.  At least he could say now\nthat he had had a patient.\n\nHe went into the back room and lit the spirit-kettle to boil the water\nfor his tea, laughing the while at the recollection of his recent\ninterview.  If all patients were like this one it could easily be\nreckoned how many it would take to ruin him completely.  Putting aside\nthe dirt upon his carpet and the loss of time, there were twopence gone\nupon the bandage, fourpence or more upon the medicine, to say nothing\nof phial, cork, label, and paper.  Then he had given her fivepence, so\nthat his first patient had absorbed altogether not less than one sixth\nof his available capital.  If five more were to come he would be a\nbroken man.  He sat down upon the portmanteau and shook with laughter\nat the thought, while he measured out his one spoonful and a half of\ntea at one shilling eightpence into the brown earthenware teapot.\nSuddenly, however, the laugh faded from his face, and he cocked his ear\ntowards the door, standing listening with a slanting head and a\nsidelong eye.  There had been a rasping of wheels against the curb, the\nsound of steps outside, and then a loud peal at the bell.  With his\nteaspoon in his hand he peeped round the corner and saw with amazement\nthat a carriage and pair were waiting outside, and that a powdered\nfootman was standing at the door.  The spoon tinkled down upon the\nfloor, and he stood gazing in bewilderment.  Then, pulling himself\ntogether, he threw open the door.\n\n\"Young man,\" said the flunky, \"tell your master, Dr. Wilkinson, that he\nis wanted just as quick as ever he can come to Lady Millbank, at the\nTowers.  He is to come this very instant.  We'd take him with us, but\nwe have to go back to see if Dr. Mason is home yet.  Just you stir your\nstumps and give him the message.\"\n\nThe footman nodded and was off in an instant, while the coachman lashed\nhis horses and the carriage flew down the street.\n\nHere was a new development.  Dr. Horace Wilkinson stood at his door and\ntried to think it all out.  Lady Millbank, of the Towers!  People of\nwealth and position, no doubt.  And a serious case, or why this haste\nand summoning of two doctors?  But, then, why in the name of all that\nis wonderful should he be sent for?\n\nHe was obscure, unknown, without influence.  There must be some\nmistake.  Yes, that must be the true explanation; or was it possible\nthat some one was attempting a cruel hoax upon him?  At any rate, it\nwas too positive a message to be disregarded.  He must set off at once\nand settle the matter one way or the other.\n\nBut he had one source of information.  At the corner of the street was\na small shop where one of the oldest inhabitants dispensed newspapers\nand gossip.  He could get information there if anywhere.  He put on his\nwell-brushed top hat, secreted instruments and bandages in all his\npockets, and without waiting for his tea closed up his establishment\nand started off upon his adventure.\n\nThe stationer at the corner was a human directory to every one and\neverything in Sutton, so that he soon had all the information which he\nwanted.  Sir John Millbank was very well known in the town, it seemed.\nHe was a merchant prince, an exporter of pens, three times mayor, and\nreported to be fully worth two millions sterling.\n\nThe Towers was his palatial seat, just outside the city.  His wife had\nbeen an invalid for some years, and was growing worse.  So far the\nwhole thing seemed to be genuine enough.  By some amazing chance these\npeople really had sent for him.\n\nAnd then another doubt assailed him, and he turned back into the shop.\n\n\"I am your neighbour, Dr. Horace Wilkinson,\" said he.  \"Is there any\nother medical man of that name in the town?\"\n\nNo, the stationer was quite positive that there was not.\n\nThat was final, then.  A great good fortune had come in his way, and he\nmust take prompt advantage of it.  He called a cab and drove furiously\nto the Towers, with his brain in a whirl, giddy with hope and delight\nat one moment, and sickened with fears and doubts at the next lest the\ncase should in some way be beyond his powers, or lest he should find at\nsome critical moment that he was without the instrument or appliance\nthat was needed.  Every strange and outre case of which he had ever\nheard or read came back into his mind, and long before he reached the\nTowers he had worked himself into a positive conviction that he would\nbe instantly required to do a trephining at the least.\n\nThe Towers was a very large house, standing back amid trees, at the\nhead of a winding drive.  As he drove up the doctor sprang out, paid\naway half his worldly assets as a fare, and followed a stately footman\nwho, having taken his name, led him through the oak-panelled,\nstained-glass hall, gorgeous with deers' heads and ancient armour, and\nushered him into a large sitting-room beyond.  A very\nirritable-looking, acid-faced man was seated in an armchair by the\nfireplace, while two young ladies in white were standing together in\nthe bow window at the further end.\n\n\"Hullo! hullo! hullo!  What's this--heh?\" cried the irritable man.\n\"Are you Dr. Wilkinson?  Eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am Dr. Wilkinson.\"\n\n\"Really, now.  You seem very young--much younger than I expected.\nWell, well, well, Mason's old, and yet he don't seem to know much about\nit.  I suppose we must try the other end now.  You're the Wilkinson who\nwrote something about the lungs?  Heh?\"\n\nHere was a light!  The only two letters which the doctor had ever\nwritten to The Lancet--modest little letters thrust away in a back\ncolumn among the wrangles about medical ethics and the inquiries as to\nhow much it took to keep a horse in the country--had been upon\npulmonary disease.  They had not been wasted, then.  Some eye had\npicked them out and marked the name of the writer.  Who could say that\nwork was ever wasted, or that merit did not promptly meet with its\nreward?\n\n\"Yes, I have written on the subject.\"\n\n\"Ha!  Well, then, where's Mason?\"\n\n\"I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance.\"\n\n\"No?--that's queer too.  He knows you and thinks a lot of your opinion.\nYou're a stranger in the town, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have only been here a very short time.\"\n\n\"That was what Mason said.  He didn't give me the address.  Said he\nwould call on you and bring you, but when the wife got worse of course\nI inquired for you and sent for you direct.  I sent for Mason, too, but\nhe was out.  However, we can't wait for him, so just run away upstairs\nand do what you can.\"\n\n\"Well, I am placed in a rather delicate position,\" said Dr. Horace\nWilkinson, with some hesitation.  \"I am here, as I understand, to meet\nmy colleague, Dr. Mason, in consultation.  It would, perhaps, hardly be\ncorrect for me to see the patient in his absence.  I think that I would\nrather wait.\"\n\n\"Would you, by Jove!  Do you think I'll let my wife get worse while the\ndoctor is coolly kicking his heels in the room below?  No, sir, I am a\nplain man, and I tell you that you will either go up or go out.\"\n\nThe style of speech jarred upon the doctor's sense of the fitness of\nthings, but still when a man's wife is ill much may be overlooked.  He\ncontented himself by bowing somewhat stiffly.  \"I shall go up, if you\ninsist upon it,\" said he.\n\n\"I do insist upon it.  And another thing, I won't have her thumped\nabout all over the chest, or any hocus-pocus of the sort.  She has\nbronchitis and asthma, and that's all.  If you can cure it well and\ngood.  But it only weakens her to have you tapping and listening, and\nit does no good either.\"\n\nPersonal disrespect was a thing that the doctor could stand; but the\nprofession was to him a holy thing, and a flippant word about it cut\nhim to the quick.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said he, picking up his hat.  \"I have the honour to wish\nyou a very good day.  I do not care to undertake the responsibility of\nthis case.\"\n\n\"Hullo! what's the matter now?\"\n\n\"It is not my habit to give opinions without examining my patient.  I\nwonder that you should suggest such a course to a medical man.  I wish\nyou good day.\"\n\nBut Sir John Millbank was a commercial man, and believed in the\ncommercial principle that the more difficult a thing is to attain the\nmore valuable it is.  A doctor's opinion had been to him a mere matter\nof guineas.  But here was a young man who seemed to care nothing either\nfor his wealth or title.  His respect for his judgment increased\namazingly.\n\n\"Tut! tut!\" said he; \"Mason is not so thin-skinned.  There! there!\nHave your way!  Do what you like and I won't say another word.  I'll\njust run upstairs and tell Lady Millbank that you are coming.\"\n\nThe door had hardly closed behind him when the two demure young ladies\ndarted out of their corner, and fluttered with joy in front of the\nastonished doctor.\n\n\"Oh, well done! well done!\" cried the taller, clapping her hands.\n\n\"Don't let him bully you, doctor,\" said the other.  \"Oh, it was so nice\nto hear you stand up to him.  That's the way he does with poor Dr.\nMason.  Dr. Mason has never examined mamma yet.  He always takes papa's\nword for everything.  Hush, Maude; here he comes again.\"  They subsided\nin an instant into their corner as silent and demure as ever.\n\nDr. Horace Wilkinson followed Sir John up the broad, thick-carpeted\nstaircase, and into the darkened sick room.  In a quarter of an hour he\nhad sounded and sifted the case to the uttermost, and descended with\nthe husband once more to the drawing-room.  In front of the fireplace\nwere standing two gentlemen, the one a very typical, clean-shaven,\ngeneral practitioner, the other a striking-looking man of middle age,\nwith pale blue eyes and a long red beard.\n\n\"Hullo, Mason, you've come at last!\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir John, and I have brought, as I promised, Dr. Wilkinson with\nme.\"\n\n\"Dr.  Wilkinson!  Why, this is he.\"\n\nDr. Mason stared in astonishment.  \"I have never seen the gentleman\nbefore!\" he cried.\n\n\"Nevertheless I am Dr. Wilkinson--Dr. Horace Wilkinson, of 114 Canal\nView.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Sir John!\" cried Dr. Mason.\n\n\"Did you think that in a case of such importance I should call in a\njunior local practitioner!  This is Dr. Adam Wilkinson, lecturer on\npulmonary diseases at Regent's College, London, physician upon the\nstaff of the St. Swithin's Hospital, and author of a dozen works upon\nthe subject.  He happened to be in Sutton upon a visit, and I thought I\nwould utilise his presence to have a first-rate opinion upon Lady\nMillbank.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Sir John, dryly.  \"But I fear my wife is rather tired\nnow, for she has just been very thoroughly examined by this young\ngentleman.  I think we will let it stop at that for the present;\nthough, of course, as you have had the trouble of coming here, I should\nbe glad to have a note of your fees.\"\n\nWhen Dr. Mason had departed, looking very disgusted, and his friend,\nthe specialist, very amused, Sir John listened to all the young\nphysician had to say about the case.\n\n\"Now, I'll tell you what,\" said he, when he had finished.  \"I'm a man\nof my word, d'ye see?  When I like a man I freeze to him.  I'm a good\nfriend and a bad enemy.  I believe in you, and I don't believe in\nMason.  From now on you are my doctor, and that of my family.  Come and\nsee my wife every day.  How does that suit your book?\"\n\n\"I am extremely grateful to you for your kind intentions toward me, but\nI am afraid there is no possible way in which I can avail myself of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Heh! what d'ye mean?\"\n\n\"I could not possibly take Dr. Mason's place in the middle of a case\nlike this.  It would be a most unprofessional act.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, go your own way!\" cried Sir John, in despair.  \"Never was\nsuch a man for making difficulties.  You've had a fair offer and you've\nrefused it, and now you can just go your own way.\"\n\nThe millionaire stumped out of the room in a huff, and Dr. Horace\nWilkinson made his way homeward to his spirit-lamp and his\none-and-eightpenny tea, with his first guinea in his pocket, and with a\nfeeling that he had upheld the best traditions of his profession.\n\nAnd yet this false start of his was a true start also, for it soon came\nto Dr. Mason's ears that his junior had had it in his power to carry\noff his best patient and had forborne to do so.  To the honour of the\nprofession be it said that such forbearance is the rule rather than the\nexception, and yet in this case, with so very junior a practitioner and\nso very wealthy a patient, the temptation was greater than is usual.\nThere was a grateful note, a visit, a friendship, and now the\nwell-known firm of Mason and Wilkinson is doing the largest family\npractice in Sutton.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CURSE OF EVE.\n\nRobert Johnson was an essentially commonplace man, with no feature to\ndistinguish him from a million others.  He was pale of face, ordinary\nin looks, neutral in opinions, thirty years of age, and a married man.\nBy trade he was a gentleman's outfitter in the New North Road, and the\ncompetition of business squeezed out of him the little character that\nwas left.  In his hope of conciliating customers he had become cringing\nand pliable, until working ever in the same routine from day to day he\nseemed to have sunk into a soulless machine rather than a man.  No\ngreat question had ever stirred him.  At the end of this snug century,\nself-contained in his own narrow circle, it seemed impossible that any\nof the mighty, primitive passions of mankind could ever reach him.  Yet\nbirth, and lust, and illness, and death are changeless things, and when\none of these harsh facts springs out upon a man at some sudden turn of\nthe path of life, it dashes off for the moment his mask of civilisation\nand gives a glimpse of the stranger and stronger face below.\n\nJohnson's wife was a quiet little woman, with brown hair and gentle\nways.  His affection for her was the one positive trait in his\ncharacter.  Together they would lay out the shop window every Monday\nmorning, the spotless shirts in their green cardboard boxes below, the\nneckties above hung in rows over the brass rails, the cheap studs\nglistening from the white cards at either side, while in the background\nwere the rows of cloth caps and the bank of boxes in which the more\nvaluable hats were screened from the sunlight.  She kept the books and\nsent out the bills.  No one but she knew the joys and sorrows which\ncrept into his small life.  She had shared his exultations when the\ngentleman who was going to India had bought ten dozen shirts and an\nincredible number of collars, and she had been as stricken as he when,\nafter the goods had gone, the bill was returned from the hotel address\nwith the intimation that no such person had lodged there.  For five\nyears they had worked, building up the business, thrown together all\nthe more closely because their marriage had been a childless one.  Now,\nhowever, there were signs that a change was at hand, and that speedily.\nShe was unable to come downstairs, and her mother, Mrs. Peyton, came\nover from Camberwell to nurse her and to welcome her grandchild.\n\nLittle qualms of anxiety came over Johnson as his wife's time\napproached.  However, after all, it was a natural process.  Other men's\nwives went through it unharmed, and why should not his?  He was himself\none of a family of fourteen, and yet his mother was alive and hearty.\nIt was quite the exception for anything to go wrong.  And yet in spite\nof his reasonings the remembrance of his wife's condition was always\nlike a sombre background to all his other thoughts.\n\nDr. Miles of Bridport Place, the best man in the neighbourhood, was\nretained five months in advance, and, as time stole on, many little\npackets of absurdly small white garments with frill work and ribbons\nbegan to arrive among the big consignments of male necessities.  And\nthen one evening, as Johnson was ticketing the scarfs in the shop, he\nheard a bustle upstairs, and Mrs. Peyton came running down to say that\nLucy was bad and that she thought the doctor ought to be there without\ndelay.\n\nIt was not Robert Johnson's nature to hurry.  He was prim and staid and\nliked to do things in an orderly fashion.  It was a quarter of a mile\nfrom the corner of the New North Road where his shop stood to the\ndoctor's house in Bridport Place.  There were no cabs in sight so he\nset off upon foot, leaving the lad to mind the shop.  At Bridport Place\nhe was told that the doctor had just gone to Harman Street to attend a\nman in a fit.  Johnson started off for Harman Street, losing a little\nof his primness as he became more anxious.  Two full cabs but no empty\nones passed him on the way.  At Harman Street he learned that the\ndoctor had gone on to a case of measles, fortunately he had left the\naddress--69 Dunstan Road, at the other side of the Regent's Canal.\nRobert's primness had vanished now as he thought of the women waiting\nat home, and he began to run as hard as he could down the Kingsland\nRoad.  Some way along he sprang into a cab which stood by the curb and\ndrove to Dunstan Road.  The doctor had just left, and Robert Johnson\nfelt inclined to sit down upon the steps in despair.\n\nFortunately he had not sent the cab away, and he was soon back at\nBridport Place.  Dr. Miles had not returned yet, but they were\nexpecting him every instant.  Johnson waited, drumming his fingers on\nhis knees, in a high, dim lit room, the air of which was charged with a\nfaint, sickly smell of ether.  The furniture was massive, and the books\nin the shelves were sombre, and a squat black clock ticked mournfully\non the mantelpiece.  It told him that it was half-past seven, and that\nhe had been gone an hour and a quarter.  Whatever would the women think\nof him!  Every time that a distant door slammed he sprang from his\nchair in a quiver of eagerness.  His ears strained to catch the deep\nnotes of the doctor's voice.  And then, suddenly, with a gush of joy he\nheard a quick step outside, and the sharp click of the key in the lock.\nIn an instant he was out in the hall, before the doctor's foot was over\nthe threshold.\n\n\"If you please, doctor, I've come for you,\" he cried; \"the wife was\ntaken bad at six o'clock.\"\n\nHe hardly knew what he expected the doctor to do.  Something very\nenergetic, certainly--to seize some drugs, perhaps, and rush excitedly\nwith him through the gaslit streets.  Instead of that Dr. Miles threw\nhis umbrella into the rack, jerked off his hat with a somewhat peevish\ngesture, and pushed Johnson back into the room.\n\n\"Let's see!  You DID engage me, didn't you?\" he asked in no very\ncordial voice.\n\n\"Oh, yes, doctor, last November.  Johnson the outfitter, you know, in\nthe New North Road.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.  It's a bit overdue,\" said the doctor, glancing at a list of\nnames in a note-book with a very shiny cover.  \"Well, how is she?\"\n\n\"I don't----\"\n\n\"Ah, of course, it's your first.  You'll know more about it next time.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Peyton said it was time you were there, sir.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, there can be no very pressing hurry in a first case.  We\nshall have an all-night affair, I fancy.  You can't get an engine to go\nwithout coals, Mr. Johnson, and I have had nothing but a light lunch.\"\n\n\"We could have something cooked for you--something hot and a cup of\ntea.\"\n\n\"Thank you, but I fancy my dinner is actually on the table.  I can do\nno good in the earlier stages.  Go home and say that I am coming, and I\nwill be round immediately afterwards.\"\n\nA sort of horror filled Robert Johnson as he gazed at this man who\ncould think about his dinner at such a moment.  He had not imagination\nenough to realise that the experience which seemed so appallingly\nimportant to him, was the merest everyday matter of business to the\nmedical man who could not have lived for a year had he not, amid the\nrush of work, remembered what was due to his own health.  To Johnson he\nseemed little better than a monster.  His thoughts were bitter as he\nsped back to his shop.\n\n\"You've taken your time,\" said his mother-in-law reproachfully, looking\ndown the stairs as he entered.\n\n\"I couldn't help it!\" he gasped.  \"Is it over?\"\n\n\"Over!  She's got to be worse, poor dear, before she can be better.\nWhere's Dr. Miles!\"\n\n\"He's coming after he's had dinner.\"  The old woman was about to make\nsome reply, when, from the half-opened door behind a high whinnying\nvoice cried out for her.  She ran back and closed the door, while\nJohnson, sick at heart, turned into the shop.  There he sent the lad\nhome and busied himself frantically in putting up shutters and turning\nout boxes.  When all was closed and finished he seated himself in the\nparlour behind the shop.  But he could not sit still.  He rose\nincessantly to walk a few paces and then fell back into a chair once\nmore.  Suddenly the clatter of china fell upon his ear, and he saw the\nmaid pass the door with a cup on a tray and a smoking teapot.\n\n\"Who is that for, Jane?\" he asked.\n\n\"For the mistress, Mr. Johnson.  She says she would fancy it.\"\n\nThere was immeasurable consolation to him in that homely cup of tea.\nIt wasn't so very bad after all if his wife could think of such things.\nSo light-hearted was he that he asked for a cup also.  He had just\nfinished it when the doctor arrived, with a small black leather bag in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Well, how is she?\" he asked genially.\n\n\"Oh, she's very much better,\" said Johnson, with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Dear me, that's bad!\" said the doctor.  \"Perhaps it will do if I look\nin on my morning round?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Johnson, clutching at his thick frieze overcoat.  \"We\nare so glad that you have come.  And, doctor, please come down soon and\nlet me know what you think about it.\"\n\nThe doctor passed upstairs, his firm, heavy steps resounding through\nthe house.  Johnson could hear his boots creaking as he walked about\nthe floor above him, and the sound was a consolation to him.  It was\ncrisp and decided, the tread of a man who had plenty of\nself-confidence.  Presently, still straining his ears to catch what was\ngoing on, he heard the scraping of a chair as it was drawn along the\nfloor, and a moment later he heard the door fly open and someone come\nrushing downstairs.  Johnson sprang up with his hair bristling,\nthinking that some dreadful thing had occurred, but it was only his\nmother-in-law, incoherent with excitement and searching for scissors\nand some tape.  She vanished again and Jane passed up the stairs with a\npile of newly aired linen.  Then, after an interval of silence, Johnson\nheard the heavy, creaking tread and the doctor came down into the\nparlour.\n\n\"That's better,\" said he, pausing with his hand upon the door.  \"You\nlook pale, Mr. Johnson.\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, not at all,\" he answered deprecatingly, mopping his brow\nwith his handkerchief.\n\n\"There is no immediate cause for alarm,\" said Dr. Miles.  \"The case is\nnot all that we could wish it.  Still we will hope for the best.\"\n\n\"Is there danger, sir?\" gasped Johnson.\n\n\"Well, there is always danger, of course.  It is not altogether a\nfavourable case, but still it might be much worse.  I have given her a\ndraught.  I saw as I passed that they have been doing a little building\nopposite to you.  It's an improving quarter.  The rents go higher and\nhigher.  You have a lease of your own little place, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, yes!\" cried Johnson, whose ears were straining for every\nsound from above, and who felt none the less that it was very soothing\nthat the doctor should be able to chat so easily at such a time.\n\"That's to say no, sir, I am a yearly tenant.\"\n\n\"Ah, I should get a lease if I were you.  There's Marshall, the\nwatchmaker, down the street.  I attended his wife twice and saw him\nthrough the typhoid when they took up the drains in Prince Street.  I\nassure you his landlord sprung his rent nearly forty a year and he had\nto pay or clear out.\"\n\n\"Did his wife get through it, doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, she did very well.  Hullo! hullo!\"\n\nHe slanted his ear to the ceiling with a questioning face, and then\ndarted swiftly from the room.\n\nIt was March and the evenings were chill, so Jane had lit the fire, but\nthe wind drove the smoke downwards and the air was full of its acrid\ntaint.  Johnson felt chilled to the bone, though rather by his\napprehensions than by the weather.  He crouched over the fire with his\nthin white hands held out to the blaze.  At ten o'clock Jane brought in\nthe joint of cold meat and laid his place for supper, but he could not\nbring himself to touch it.  He drank a glass of the beer, however, and\nfelt the better for it.  The tension of his nerves seemed to have\nreacted upon his hearing, and he was able to follow the most trivial\nthings in the room above.  Once, when the beer was still heartening\nhim, he nerved himself to creep on tiptoe up the stair and to listen to\nwhat was going on.  The bedroom door was half an inch open, and through\nthe slit he could catch a glimpse of the clean-shaven face of the\ndoctor, looking wearier and more anxious than before.  Then he rushed\ndownstairs like a lunatic, and running to the door he tried to distract\nhis thoughts by watching what; was going on in the street.  The shops\nwere all shut, and some rollicking boon companions came shouting along\nfrom the public-house.  He stayed at the door until the stragglers had\nthinned down, and then came back to his seat by the fire.  In his dim\nbrain he was asking himself questions which had never intruded\nthemselves before.  Where was the justice of it?  What had his sweet,\ninnocent little wife done that she should be used so?  Why was nature\nso cruel?  He was frightened at his own thoughts, and yet wondered that\nthey had never occurred to him before.\n\nAs the early morning drew in, Johnson, sick at heart and shivering in\nevery limb, sat with his great coat huddled round him, staring at the\ngrey ashes and waiting hopelessly for some relief.  His face was white\nand clammy, and his nerves had been numbed into a half conscious state\nby the long monotony of misery.  But suddenly all his feelings leapt\ninto keen life again as he heard the bedroom door open and the doctor's\nsteps upon the stair.  Robert Johnson was precise and unemotional in\neveryday life, but he almost shrieked now as he rushed forward to know\nif it were over.\n\nOne glance at the stern, drawn face which met him showed that it was no\npleasant news which had sent the doctor downstairs.  His appearance had\naltered as much as Johnson's during the last few hours.  His hair was\non end, his face flushed, his forehead dotted with beads of\nperspiration.  There was a peculiar fierceness in his eye, and about\nthe lines of his mouth, a fighting look as befitted a man who for hours\non end had been striving with the hungriest of foes for the most\nprecious of prizes.  But there was a sadness too, as though his grim\nopponent had been overmastering him.  He sat down and leaned his head\nupon his hand like a man who is fagged out.\n\n\"I thought it my duty to see you, Mr. Johnson, and to tell you that it\nis a very nasty case.  Your wife's heart is not strong, and she has\nsome symptoms which I do not like.  What I wanted to say is that if you\nwould like to have a second opinion I shall be very glad to meet anyone\nwhom you might suggest.\"\n\nJohnson was so dazed by his want of sleep and the evil news that he\ncould hardly grasp the doctor's meaning.  The other, seeing him\nhesitate, thought that he was considering the expense.\n\n\"Smith or Hawley would come for two guineas,\" said he.  \"But I think\nPritchard of the City Road is the best man.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, bring the best man,\" cried Johnson.\n\n\"Pritchard would want three guineas.  He is a senior man, you see.\"\n\n\"I'd give him all I have if he would pull her through.  Shall I run for\nhim?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Go to my house first and ask for the green baize bag.  The\nassistant will give it to you.  Tell him I want the A. C. E. mixture.\nHer heart is too weak for chloroform.  Then go for Pritchard and bring\nhim back with you.\"\n\nIt was heavenly for Johnson to have something to do and to feel that he\nwas of some use to his wife.  He ran swiftly to Bridport Place, his\nfootfalls clattering through the silent streets and the big dark\npolicemen turning their yellow funnels of light on him as he passed.\nTwo tugs at the night-bell brought down a sleepy, half-clad assistant,\nwho handed him a stoppered glass bottle and a cloth bag which contained\nsomething which clinked when you moved it.  Johnson thrust the bottle\ninto his pocket, seized the green bag, and pressing his hat firmly down\nran as hard as he could set foot to ground until he was in the City\nRoad and saw the name of Pritchard engraved in white upon a red ground.\nHe bounded in triumph up the three steps which led to the door, and as\nhe did so there was a crash behind him.  His precious bottle was in\nfragments upon the pavement.\n\nFor a moment he felt as if it were his wife's body that was lying\nthere.  But the run had freshened his wits and he saw that the mischief\nmight be repaired.  He pulled vigorously at the night-bell.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter?\" asked a gruff voice at his elbow.  He\nstarted back and looked up at the windows, but there was no sign of\nlife.  He was approaching the bell again with the intention of pulling\nit, when a perfect roar burst from the wall.\n\n\"I can't stand shivering here all night,\" cried the voice.  \"Say who\nyou are and what you want or I shut the tube.\"\n\nThen for the first time Johnson saw that the end of a speaking-tube\nhung out of the wall just above the bell.  He shouted up it,--\n\n\"I want you to come with me to meet Dr. Miles at a confinement at once.\"\n\n\"How far?\" shrieked the irascible voice.\n\n\"The New North Road, Hoxton.\"\n\n\"My consultation fee is three guineas, payable at the time.\"\n\n\"All right,\" shouted Johnson.  \"You are to bring a bottle of A. C. E.\nmixture with you.\"\n\n\"All right!  Wait a bit!\"\n\nFive minutes later an elderly, hard-faced man, with grizzled hair,\nflung open the door.  As he emerged a voice from somewhere in the\nshadows cried,--\n\n\"Mind you take your cravat, John,\" and he impatiently growled something\nover his shoulder in reply.\n\nThe consultant was a man who had been hardened by a life of ceaseless\nlabour, and who had been driven, as so many others have been, by the\nneeds of his own increasing family to set the commercial before the\nphilanthropic side of his profession.  Yet beneath his rough crust he\nwas a man with a kindly heart.\n\n\"We don't want to break a record,\" said he, pulling up and panting\nafter attempting to keep up with Johnson for five minutes.  \"I would go\nquicker if I could, my dear sir, and I quite sympathise with your\nanxiety, but really I can't manage it.\"\n\nSo Johnson, on fire with impatience, had to slow down until they\nreached the New North Road, when he ran ahead and had the door open for\nthe doctor when he came.  He heard the two meet outside the bed-room,\nand caught scraps of their conversation.  \"Sorry to knock you up--nasty\ncase--decent people.\"  Then it sank into a mumble and the door closed\nbehind them.\n\nJohnson sat up in his chair now, listening keenly, for he knew that a\ncrisis must be at hand.  He heard the two doctors moving about, and was\nable to distinguish the step of Pritchard, which had a drag in it, from\nthe clean, crisp sound of the other's footfall.  There was silence for\na few minutes and then a curious drunken, mumbling sing-song voice came\nquavering up, very unlike anything which he had heard hitherto.  At the\nsame time a sweetish, insidious scent, imperceptible perhaps to any\nnerves less strained than his, crept down the stairs and penetrated\ninto the room.  The voice dwindled into a mere drone and finally sank\naway into silence, and Johnson gave a long sigh of relief, for he knew\nthat the drug had done its work and that, come what might, there should\nbe no more pain for the sufferer.\n\nBut soon the silence became even more trying to him than the cries had\nbeen.  He had no clue now as to what was going on, and his mind swarmed\nwith horrible possibilities.  He rose and went to the bottom of the\nstairs again.  He heard the clink of metal against metal, and the\nsubdued murmur of the doctors' voices.  Then he heard Mrs. Peyton say\nsomething, in a tone as of fear or expostulation, and again the doctors\nmurmured together.  For twenty minutes he stood there leaning against\nthe wall, listening to the occasional rumbles of talk without being\nable to catch a word of it.  And then of a sudden there rose out of the\nsilence the strangest little piping cry, and Mrs. Peyton screamed out\nin her delight and the man ran into the parlour and flung himself down\nupon the horse-hair sofa, drumming his heels on it in his ecstasy.\n\nBut often the great cat Fate lets us go only to clutch us again in a\nfiercer grip.  As minute after minute passed and still no sound came\nfrom above save those thin, glutinous cries, Johnson cooled from his\nfrenzy of joy, and lay breathless with his ears straining.  They were\nmoving slowly about.  They were talking in subdued tones.  Still minute\nafter minute passing, and no word from the voice for which he listened.\nHis nerves were dulled by his night of trouble, and he waited in limp\nwretchedness upon his sofa.  There he still sat when the doctors came\ndown to him--a bedraggled, miserable figure with his face grimy and his\nhair unkempt from his long vigil.  He rose as they entered, bracing\nhimself against the mantelpiece.\n\n\"Is she dead?\" he asked.\n\n\"Doing well,\" answered the doctor.\n\nAnd at the words that little conventional spirit which had never known\nuntil that night the capacity for fierce agony which lay within it,\nlearned for the second time that there were springs of joy also which\nit had never tapped before.  His impulse was to fall upon his knees,\nbut he was shy before the doctors.\n\n\"Can I go up?\"\n\n\"In a few minutes.\"\n\n\"I'm sure, doctor, I'm very--I'm very----\" he grew inarticulate.  \"Here\nare your three guineas, Dr. Pritchard.  I wish they were three hundred.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said the senior man, and they laughed as they shook hands.\n\nJohnson opened the shop door for them and heard their talk as they\nstood for an instant outside.\n\n\"Looked nasty at one time.\"\n\n\"Very glad to have your help.\"\n\n\"Delighted, I'm sure.  Won't you step round and have a cup of coffee?\"\n\n\"No, thanks.  I'm expecting another case.\"\n\nThe firm step and the dragging one passed away to the right and the\nleft.  Johnson turned from the door still with that turmoil of joy in\nhis heart.  He seemed to be making a new start in life.  He felt that\nhe was a stronger and a deeper man.  Perhaps all this suffering had an\nobject then.  It might prove to be a blessing both to his wife and to\nhim.  The very thought was one which he would have been incapable of\nconceiving twelve hours before.  He was full of new emotions.  If there\nhad been a harrowing there had been a planting too.\n\n\"Can I come up?\" he cried, and then, without waiting for an answer, he\ntook the steps three at a time.\n\nMrs. Peyton was standing by a soapy bath with a bundle in her hands.\nFrom under the curve of a brown shawl there looked out at him the\nstrangest little red face with crumpled features, moist, loose lips,\nand eyelids which quivered like a rabbit's nostrils.  The weak neck had\nlet the head topple over, and it rested upon the shoulder.\n\n\"Kiss it, Robert!\" cried the grandmother. \"Kiss your son!\"\n\nBut he felt a resentment to the little, red, blinking creature.  He\ncould not forgive it yet for that long night of misery.  He caught\nsight of a white face in the bed and he ran towards it with such love\nand pity as his speech could find no words for.\n\n\"Thank God it is over!  Lucy, dear, it was dreadful!\"\n\n\"But I'm so happy now.  I never was so happy in my life.\"\n\nHer eyes were fixed upon the brown bundle.\n\n\"You mustn't talk,\" said Mrs. Peyton.\n\n\"But don't leave me,\"  whispered his wife.\n\nSo he sat in silence with his hand in hers.  The lamp was burning dim\nand the first cold light of dawn was breaking through the window.  The\nnight had been long and dark but the day was the sweeter and the purer\nin consequence.  London was waking up.  The roar began to rise from the\nstreet.  Lives had come and lives had gone, but the great machine was\nstill working out its dim and tragic destiny.\n\n\n\n\nSWEETHEARTS.\n\nIt is hard for the general practitioner who sits among his patients\nboth morning and evening, and sees them in their homes between, to\nsteal time for one little daily breath of cleanly air.  To win it he\nmust slip early from his bed and walk out between shuttered shops when\nit is chill but very clear, and all things are sharply outlined, as in\na frost.  It is an hour that has a charm of its own, when, but for a\npostman or a milkman, one has the pavement to oneself, and even the\nmost common thing takes an ever-recurring freshness, as though\ncauseway, and lamp, and signboard had all wakened to the new day.  Then\neven an inland city may seem beautiful, and bear virtue in its\nsmoke-tainted air.\n\nBut it was by the sea that I lived, in a town that was unlovely enough\nwere it not for its glorious neighbour.  And who cares for the town\nwhen one can sit on the bench at the headland, and look out over the\nhuge, blue bay, and the yellow scimitar that curves before it.  I loved\nit when its great face was freckled with the fishing boats, and I loved\nit when the big ships went past, far out, a little hillock of white and\nno hull, with topsails curved like a bodice, so stately and demure.\nBut most of all I loved it when no trace of man marred the majesty of\nNature, and when the sun-bursts slanted down on it from between the\ndrifting rainclouds.  Then I have seen the further edge draped in the\ngauze of the driving rain, with its thin grey shading under the slow\nclouds, while my headland was golden, and the sun gleamed upon the\nbreakers and struck deep through the green waves beyond, showing up the\npurple patches where the beds of seaweed are lying.  Such a morning as\nthat, with the wind in his hair, and the spray on his lips, and the cry\nof the eddying gulls in his ear, may send a man back braced afresh to\nthe reek of a sick-room, and the dead, drab weariness of practice.\n\nIt was on such another day that I first saw my old man.  He came to my\nbench just as I was leaving it.  My eye must have picked him out even\nin a crowded street, for he was a man of large frame and fine presence,\nwith something of distinction in the set of his lip and the poise of\nhis head.  He limped up the winding path leaning heavily upon his\nstick, as though those great shoulders had become too much at last for\nthe failing limbs that bore them.  As he approached, my eyes caught\nNature's danger signal, that faint bluish tinge in nose and lip which\ntells of a labouring heart.\n\n\"The brae is a little trying, sir,\" said I.  \"Speaking  as a physician,\nI should say that you would do well to rest here before you go further.\"\n\nHe inclined his head in a stately, old-world fashion, and seated\nhimself upon the bench.  Seeing that he had no wish to speak I was\nsilent also, but I could not help watching him out of the corners of my\neyes, for he was such a wonderful survival of the early half of the\ncentury, with his low-crowned, curly-brimmed hat, his black satin tie\nwhich fastened with a buckle at the back, and, above all, his large,\nfleshy, clean-shaven face shot with its mesh of wrinkles.  Those eyes,\nere they had grown dim, had looked out from the box-seat of mail\ncoaches, and had seen the knots of navvies as they toiled on the brown\nembankments.  Those lips had smiled over the first numbers of\n\"Pickwick,\" and had gossiped of the promising young man who wrote them.\nThe face itself was a seventy-year almanack, and every seam an entry\nupon it where public as well as private sorrow left its trace.  That\npucker on the forehead stood for the Mutiny, perhaps; that line of care\nfor the Crimean winter, it may be; and that last little sheaf of\nwrinkles, as my fancy hoped, for the death of Gordon.  And so, as I\ndreamed in my foolish way, the old gentleman with the shining stock was\ngone, and it was seventy years of a great nation's life that took shape\nbefore me on the headland in the morning.\n\nBut he soon brought me back to earth again.  As he recovered his breath\nhe took a letter out of his pocket, and, putting on a pair of\nhorn-rimmed eye-glasses, he read it through very carefully.  Without\nany design of playing the spy I could not help observing that it was in\na woman's hand.  When he had finished it he read it again, and then sat\nwith the corners of his mouth drawn down and his eyes staring vacantly\nout over the bay, the most forlorn-looking old gentleman that ever I\nhave seen.  All that is kindly within me was set stirring by that\nwistful face, but I knew that he was in no humour for talk, and so, at\nlast, with my breakfast and my patients calling me, I left him on the\nbench and started for home.\n\nI never gave him another thought until the next morning, when, at the\nsame hour, he turned up upon the headland, and shared the bench which I\nhad been accustomed to look upon as my own.  He bowed again before\nsitting down, but was no more inclined than formerly to enter into\nconversation.  There had been a change in him during the last\ntwenty-four hours, and all for the worse.  The face seemed more heavy\nand more wrinkled, while that ominous venous tinge was more pronounced\nas he panted up the hill.  The clean lines of his cheek and chin were\nmarred by a day's growth of grey stubble, and his large, shapely head\nhad lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first\nI glanced at him.  He had a letter there, the same, or another, but\nstill in a woman's hand, and over this he was moping and mumbling in\nhis senile fashion, with his brow puckered, and the corners of his\nmouth drawn down like those of a fretting child.  So I left him, with a\nvague wonder as to who he might be, and why a single spring day should\nhave wrought such a change upon him.\n\nSo interested was I that next morning I was on the look out for him.\nSure enough, at the same hour, I saw him coming up the hill; but very\nslowly, with a bent back and a heavy head.  It was shocking to me to\nsee the change in him as he approached.\n\n\"I am afraid that our air does not agree with you, sir,\" I ventured to\nremark.\n\nBut it was as though he had no heart for talk.  He tried, as I thought,\nto make some fitting reply, but it slurred off into a mumble and\nsilence.  How bent and weak and old he seemed--ten years older at the\nleast than when first I had seen him!  It went to my heart to see this\nfine old fellow wasting away before my eyes.  There was the eternal\nletter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers.  Who was this woman\nwhose words moved him so?  Some daughter, perhaps, or granddaughter,\nwho should have been the light of his home instead of----  I smiled to\nfind how bitter I was growing, and how swiftly I was weaving a romance\nround an unshaven old man and his correspondence.  Yet all day he\nlingered in my mind, and I had fitful glimpses of those two trembling,\nblue-veined, knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them.\n\nI had hardly hoped to see him again.  Another day's decline must, I\nthought, hold him to his room, if not to his bed.  Great, then, was my\nsurprise when, as I approached my bench, I saw that he was already\nthere.  But as I came up to him I could scarce be sure that it was\nindeed the same man.  There were the curly-brimmed hat, and the shining\nstock, and the horn glasses, but where were the stoop and the\ngrey-stubbled, pitiable face?  He was clean-shaven and firm lipped,\nwith a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great\nshoulders like an eagle on a rock.  His back was as straight and square\nas a grenadier's, and he switched at the pebbles with his stick in his\nexuberant vitality.  In the button-hole of his well-brushed black coat\nthere glinted a golden blossom, and the corner of a dainty red silk\nhandkerchief lapped over from his breast pocket.  He might have been\nthe eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning\nbefore.\n\n\"Good morning, Sir, good morning!\" he cried with a merry waggle of his\ncane.\n\n\"Good morning!\" I answered, \"how beautiful the bay is looking.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir, but you should have seen it just before the sun rose.\"\n\n\"What, have you been here since then?\"\n\n\"I was here when there was scarce light to see the path.\"\n\n\"You are a very early riser.\"\n\n\"On occasion, sir; on occasion!\"  He cocked his eye at me as if to\ngauge whether I were worthy of his confidence.  \"The fact is, sir, that\nmy wife is coming back to me to day.\"\n\nI suppose that my face showed that I did not quite see the force of the\nexplanation.  My eyes, too, may have given him assurance of sympathy,\nfor he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low,\nconfidential voice, as if the matter were of such weight that even the\nsea-gulls must be kept out of our councils.\n\n\"Are you a married man, Sir?\"\n\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you cannot quite understand it.  My wife and I have been\nmarried for nearly fifty years, and we have never been parted, never at\nall, until now.\"\n\n\"Was it for long?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  This is the fourth day.  She had to go to Scotland.  A\nmatter of duty, you understand, and the doctors would not let me go.\nNot that I would have allowed them to stop me, but she was on their\nside.  Now, thank God! it is over, and she may be here at any moment.\"\n\n\"Here!\"\n\n\"Yes, here.  This headland and bench were old friends of ours thirty\nyears ago.  The people with whom we stay are not, to tell the truth,\nvery congenial, and we have, little privacy among them.  That is why we\nprefer to meet here.  I could not be sure which train would bring her,\nbut if she had come by the very earliest she would have found me\nwaiting.\"\n\n\"In that case----\" said I, rising.\n\n\"No, sir, no,\" he entreated, \"I beg that you will stay.  It does not\nweary you, this domestic talk of mine?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\n\"I have been so driven inwards during these few last days! Ah, what a\nnightmare it has been! Perhaps it may seem strange to you that an old\nfellow like me should feel like this.\"\n\n\"It is charming.\"\n\n\"No credit to me, sir!  There's not a man on this planet but would feel\nthe same if he had the good fortune to be married to such a woman.\nPerhaps, because you see me like this, and hear me speak of our long\nlife together, you conceive that she is old, too.\"\n\nHe laughed heartily, and his eyes twinkled at the humour of the idea.\n\n\"She's one of those women, you know, who have youth in their hearts,\nand so it can never be very far from their faces.  To me she's just as\nshe was when she first took my hand in hers in '45.  A wee little bit\nstouter, perhaps, but then, if she had a fault as a girl, it was that\nshe was a shade too slender.  She was above me in station, you know--I\na clerk, and she the daughter of my employer.  Oh! it was quite a\nromance, I give you my word, and I won her; and, somehow, I have never\ngot over the freshness and the wonder of it.  To think that that sweet,\nlovely girl has walked by my side all through life, and that I have\nbeen able----\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, and I glanced round at him in surprise.  He was\nshaking all over, in every fibre of his great body.  His hands were\nclawing at the woodwork, and his feet shuffling on the gravel.  I saw\nwhat it was.  He was trying to rise, but was so excited that he could\nnot.  I half extended my hand, but a higher courtesy constrained me to\ndraw it back again and turn my face to the sea.  An instant afterwards\nhe was up and hurrying down the path.\n\nA woman was coming towards us.  She was quite close before he had seen\nher--thirty yards at the utmost.  I know not if she had ever been as he\ndescribed her, or whether it was but some ideal which he carried in his\nbrain.  The person upon whom I looked was tall, it is true, but she was\nthick and shapeless, with a ruddy, full-blown face,  and a skirt\ngrotesquely gathered up.  There was a green ribbon in her hat, which\njarred upon my eyes, and her blouse-like bodice was full and clumsy.\nAnd this was the lovely girl, the ever youthful!  My heart sank as I\nthought how little such a woman might appreciate him, how unworthy she\nmight be of his love.\n\nShe came up the path in her solid way, while he staggered along to meet\nher.  Then, as they came together, looking discreetly out of the\nfurthest corner of my eye, I saw that he put out both his hands, while\nshe, shrinking from a public caress, took one of them in hers and shook\nit.  As she did so I saw her face, and I was easy in my mind for my old\nman.  God grant that when this hand is shaking, and when this back is\nbowed, a woman's eyes may look so into mine.\n\n\n\n\nA PHYSIOLOGIST'S WIFE.\n\nProfessor Ainslie Grey had not come down to breakfast at the usual\nhour.  The presentation chiming-clock which stood between the\nterra-cotta busts of Claude Bernard and of John Hunter upon the\ndining-room mantelpiece had rung out the half-hour and the\nthree-quarters.  Now its golden hand was verging upon the nine, and yet\nthere were no signs of the master of the house.\n\nIt was an unprecedented occurrence.  During the twelve years that she\nhad kept house for him, his youngest sister had never known him a\nsecond behind his time.  She sat now in front of the high silver\ncoffee-pot, uncertain whether to order the gong to be resounded or to\nwait on in silence.  Either course might be a mistake.  Her brother was\nnot a man who permitted mistakes.\n\nMiss Ainslie Grey was rather above the middle height, thin, with\npeering, puckered eyes, and the rounded shoulders which mark the\nbookish woman.  Her face was long and spare, flecked with colour above\nthe cheek-bones, with a reasonable, thoughtful forehead, and a dash of\nabsolute obstinacy in her thin lips and prominent chin.  Snow white\ncuffs and collar, with a plain dark dress, cut with almost Quaker-like\nsimplicity, bespoke the primness of her taste.  An ebony cross hung\nover her flattened chest.  She sat very upright in her chair, listening\nwith raised eyebrows, and swinging her eye-glasses backwards and\nforwards with a nervous gesture which was peculiar to her.\n\nSuddenly she gave a sharp, satisfied jerk of the head, and began to\npour out the coffee.  From outside there came the dull thudding sound\nof heavy feet upon thick carpet.  The door swung open, and the\nProfessor entered with a quick, nervous step.  He nodded to his sister,\nand seating himself at the other side of the table, began to open the\nsmall pile of letters which lay beside his plate.\n\nProfessor Ainslie Grey was at that time forty-three years of\nage--nearly twelve years older than his sister.  His career had been a\nbrilliant one.  At Edinburgh, at Cambridge, and at Vienna he had laid\nthe foundations of his great reputation, both in physiology and in\nzoology.\n\nHis pamphlet, On the Mesoblastic Origin of Excitomotor Nerve Roots, had\nwon him his fellowship of the Royal Society; and his researches, Upon\nthe Nature of Bathybius, with some Remarks upon Lithococci, had been\ntranslated into at least three European languages.  He had been\nreferred to by one of the greatest living authorities as being the very\ntype and embodiment of all that was best in modern science.  No wonder,\nthen, that when the commercial city of Birchespool decided to create a\nmedical school, they were only too glad to confer the chair of\nphysiology upon Mr. Ainslie Grey.  They valued him the more from the\nconviction that their class was only one step in his upward journey,\nand that the first vacancy would remove him to some more illustrious\nseat of learning.\n\nIn person he was not unlike his sister.  The same eyes, the same\ncontour, the same intellectual forehead.  His lips, however, were\nfirmer, and his long, thin, lower jaw was sharper and more decided.  He\nran his finger and thumb down it from time to time, as he glanced over\nhis letters.\n\n\"Those maids are very noisy,\" he remarked, as a clack of tongues\nsounded in the distance.\n\n\"It is Sarah,\" said his sister; \"I shall speak about it.\"\n\nShe had handed over his coffee-cup, and was sipping at her own,\nglancing furtively through her narrowed lids at the austere face of her\nbrother.\n\n\"The first great advance of the human race,\" said the Professor, \"was\nwhen, by the development of their left frontal convolutions, they\nattained the power of speech.  Their second advance was when they\nlearned to control that power.  Woman has not yet attained the second\nstage.\"\n\nHe half closed his eyes as he spoke, and thrust his chin forward, but\nas he ceased he had a trick of suddenly opening both eyes very wide and\nstaring sternly at his interlocutor.\n\n\"I am not garrulous, John,\" said his sister.\n\n\"No, Ada; in many respects you approach the superior or male type.\"\n\nThe Professor bowed over his egg with the manner of one who utters a\ncourtly compliment; but the lady pouted, and gave an impatient little\nshrug of her shoulders.\n\n\"You were late this morning, John,\" she remarked, after a pause.\n\n\"Yes, Ada; I slept badly.  Some little cerebral congestion, no doubt\ndue to over-stimulation of the centers of thought.  I have been a\nlittle disturbed in my mind.\"\n\nHis sister stared across at him in astonishment.  The Professor's\nmental processes had hitherto been as regular as his habits.  Twelve\nyears' continual intercourse had taught her that he lived in a serene\nand rarefied atmosphere of scientific calm, high above the petty\nemotions which affect humbler minds.\n\n\"You are surprised, Ada,\" he remarked.  \"Well, I cannot wonder at it.\nI should have been surprised myself if I had been told that I was so\nsensitive to vascular influences.  For, after all, all disturbances are\nvascular if you probe them deep enough.  I am thinking of getting\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Not Mrs. O'James\" cried Ada Grey, laying down her egg-spoon.\n\n\"My dear, you have the feminine quality of receptivity very remarkably\ndeveloped.  Mrs. O'James is the lady in question.\"\n\n\"But you know so little of her.  The Esdailes themselves know so\nlittle.  She is really only an acquaintance, although she is staying at\nThe Lindens.  Would it not be wise to speak to Mrs. Esdaile first,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"I do not think, Ada, that Mrs. Esdaile is at all likely to say\nanything which would materially affect my course of action.  I have\ngiven the matter due consideration.  The scientific mind is slow at\narriving at conclusions, but having once formed them, it is not prone\nto change.  Matrimony is the natural condition of the human race.  I\nhave, as you know, been so engaged in academical and other work, that I\nhave had no time to devote to merely personal questions.  It is\ndifferent now, and I see no valid reason why I should forego this\nopportunity of seeking a suitable helpmate.\"\n\n\"And you are engaged?\"\n\n\"Hardly that, Ada.  I ventured yesterday to indicate to the lady that I\nwas prepared to submit to the common lot of humanity.  I shall wait\nupon her after my morning lecture, and learn how far my proposals meet\nwith her acquiescence.  But you frown, Ada!\"\n\nHis sister started, and made an effort to conceal her expression of\nannoyance.  She even stammered out some few words of congratulation,\nbut a vacant look had come into her brother's eyes, and he was\nevidently not listening to her.\n\n\"I am sure, John, that I wish you the happiness which you deserve.  If\nI hesitated at all, it is because I know how much is at stake, and\nbecause the thing is so sudden, so unexpected.\"  Her thin white hand\nstole up to the black cross upon her bosom.  \"These are moments when we\nneed guidance, John.  If I could persuade you to turn to spiritual----\"\n\nThe Professor waved the suggestion away with a deprecating hand.\n\n\"It is useless to reopen that question,\" he said.  \"We cannot argue\nupon it.  You assume more than I can grant.  I am forced to dispute\nyour premises.  We have no common basis.\"\n\nHis sister sighed.\n\n\"You have no faith,\" she said.\n\n\"I have faith in those great evolutionary forces which are leading the\nhuman race to some unknown but elevated goal.\"\n\n\"You believe in nothing.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my dear Ada, I believe in the differentiation of\nprotoplasm.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly.  It was the one subject upon which she\nventured to dispute her brother's infallibility.\n\n\"This is rather beside the question,\" remarked the Professor, folding\nup his napkin.  \"If I am not mistaken, there is some possibility of\nanother matrimonial event occurring in the family.  Eh, Ada?  What!\"\n\nHis small eyes glittered with sly facetiousness as he shot a twinkle at\nhis sister.  She sat very stiff, and traced patterns upon the cloth\nwith the sugar-tongs.\n\n\"Dr. James M'Murdo O'Brien----\" said the Professor, sonorously.\n\n\"Don't, John, don't!\" cried Miss Ainslie Grey.\n\n\"Dr. James M'Murdo O'Brien,\" continued her brother inexorably, \"is a\nman who has already made his mark upon the science of the day.  He is\nmy first and my most distinguished pupil.  I assure you, Ada, that his\n'Remarks upon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin,'\nis likely to live as a classic.  It is not too much to say that he has\nrevolutionised our views about urobilin.\"\n\nHe paused, but his sister sat silent, with bent head and flushed\ncheeks.  The little ebony cross rose and fell with her hurried\nbreathings.\n\n\"Dr. James M'Murdo O'Brien has, as you know, the offer of the\nphysiological chair at Melbourne.  He has been in Australia five years,\nand has a brilliant future before him.  To-day he leaves us for\nEdinburgh, and in two months' time, he goes out to take over his new\nduties.  You know his feeling towards you.  It, rests with you as to\nwhether he goes out alone.  Speaking for myself, I cannot imagine any\nhigher mission for a woman of culture than to go through life in the\ncompany of a man who is capable of such a research as that which Dr.\nJames M'Murdo O'Brien has brought to a successful conclusion.\"\n\n\"He has not spoken to me,\" murmured the lady.\n\n\"Ah, there are signs which are more subtle than speech,\" said her\nbrother, wagging his head.  \"But you are pale.  Your vasomotor system\nis excited.  Your arterioles have contracted.  Let me entreat you to\ncompose yourself.  I think I hear the carriage.  I fancy that you may\nhave a visitor this morning, Ada.  You will excuse me now.\"\n\nWith a quick glance at the clock he strode off into the hall, and\nwithin a few minutes he was rattling in his quiet, well-appointed\nbrougham through the brick-lined streets of Birchespool.\n\nHis lecture over, Professor Ainslie Grey paid a visit to his\nlaboratory, where he adjusted several scientific instruments, made a\nnote as to the progress of three separate infusions of bacteria, cut\nhalf-a-dozen sections with a microtome, and finally resolved the\ndifficulties of seven different gentlemen, who were pursuing researches\nin as many separate lines of inquiry.  Having thus conscientiously and\nmethodically completed the routine of his duties, he returned to his\ncarriage and ordered the coachman to drive him to The Lindens.  His\nface as he drove was cold and impassive, but he drew his fingers from\ntime to time down his prominent chin with a jerky, twitchy movement.\n\nThe Lindens was an old-fashioned, ivy-clad house which had once been in\nthe country, but was now caught in the long, red-brick feelers of the\ngrowing city.  It still stood back from the road in the privacy of its\nown grounds.  A winding path, lined with laurel bushes, led to the\narched and porticoed entrance.  To the right was a lawn, and at the far\nside, under the shadow of a hawthorn, a lady sat in a garden-chair with\na book in her hands.  At the click of the gate she started, and the\nProfessor, catching sight of her, turned away from the door, and strode\nin her direction.\n\n\"What! won't you go in and see Mrs. Esdaile?\" she asked, sweeping out\nfrom under the shadow of the hawthorn.\n\nShe was a small woman, strongly feminine, from the rich coils of her\nlight-coloured hair to the dainty garden slipper which peeped from\nunder her cream-tinted dress.  One tiny well-gloved hand was\noutstretched in greeting, while the other pressed a thick,\ngreen-covered volume against her side.  Her decision and quick, tactful\nmanner bespoke the mature woman of the world; but her upraised face had\npreserved a girlish and even infantile expression of innocence in its\nlarge, fearless, grey eyes, and sensitive, humorous mouth.  Mrs.\nO'James was a widow, and she was two-and-thirty years of age; but\nneither fact could have been deduced from her appearance.\n\n\"You will surely go in and see Mrs. Esdaile,\" she repeated, glancing up\nat him with eyes which had in them something between a challenge and a\ncaress.\n\n\"I did not come to see Mrs. Esdaile,\" he answered, with no relaxation\nof his cold and grave manner; \"I came to see you.\"\n\n\"I am sure I should be highly honoured,\" she said, with just the\nslightest little touch of brogue in her accent.  \"What are the students\nto do without their Professor?\"\n\n\"I have already completed my academic duties.  Take my arm, and we\nshall walk in the sunshine.  Surely we cannot wonder that Eastern\npeople should have made a deity of the sun.  It is the great beneficent\nforce of Nature--man's ally against cold, sterility, and all that is\nabhorrent to him.  What were you reading?\"\n\n\"Hale's Matter and Life.\"\n\nThe Professor raised his thick eyebrows.\n\n\"Hale!\" he said, and then again in a kind of whisper, \"Hale!\"\n\n\"You differ from him?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is not I who differ from him.  I am only a monad--a thing of no\nmoment.  The whole tendency of the highest plane of modern thought\ndiffers from him.  He defends the indefensible.  He is an excellent\nobserver, but a feeble reasoner.  I should not recommend you to found\nyour conclusions upon Hale.\"\n\n\"I must read Nature's Chronicle to counteract his pernicious\ninfluence,\" said Mrs. O'James, with a soft, cooing laugh.\n\nNature's Chronicle was one of the many books in which Professor Ainslie\nGrey had enforced the negative doctrines of scientific agnosticism.\n\n\"It is a faulty work,\" said he; \"I cannot recommend it.  I would rather\nrefer you to the standard writings of some of my older and more\neloquent colleagues.\"\n\nThere was a pause in their talk as they paced up and down on the green,\nvelvet-like lawn in the genial sunshine.\n\n\"Have you thought at all,\" he asked at last, \"of the matter upon which\nI spoke to you last night?\"\n\nShe said nothing, but walked by his side with her eyes averted and her\nface aslant.\n\n\"I would not hurry you unduly,\" he continued.  \"I know that it is a\nmatter which can scarcely be decided off-hand.  In my own case, it cost\nme some thought before I ventured to make the suggestion.  I am not an\nemotional man, but I am conscious in your presence of the great\nevolutionary instinct which makes either sex the complement of the\nother.\"\n\n\"You believe in love, then?\" she asked, with a twinkling, upward glance.\n\n\"I am forced to.\"\n\n\"And yet you can deny the soul?\"\n\n\"How far these questions are psychic and how far material is still sub\njudice,\" said the Professor, with an air of toleration.  \"Protoplasm\nmay prove to be the physical basis of love as well as of life.\"\n\n\"How inflexible you are!\" she exclaimed; \"you would draw love down to\nthe level of physics.\"\n\n\"Or draw physics up to the level of love.\"\n\n\"Come, that is much better,\" she cried, with her sympathetic laugh.\n\"That is really very pretty, and puts science in quite a delightful\nlight.\"\n\nHer eyes sparkled, and she tossed her chin with the pretty, wilful air\nof a woman who is mistress of the situation.\n\n\"I have reason to believe,\" said the Professor, \"that my position here\nwill prove to be only a stepping-stone to some wider scene of\nscientific activity.  Yet, even here, my chair brings me in some\nfifteen hundred pounds a year, which is supplemented by a few hundreds\nfrom my books.  I should therefore be in a position to provide you with\nthose comforts to which you are accustomed.  So much for my pecuniary\nposition.  As to my constitution, it has always been sound.  I have\nnever suffered from any illness in my life, save fleeting attacks of\ncephalalgia, the result of too prolonged a stimulation of the centres\nof cerebration.  My father and mother had no sign of any morbid\ndiathesis, but I will not conceal from you that my grandfather was\nafflicted with podagra.\"\n\nMrs. O'James looked startled.\n\n\"Is that very serious?\" she asked.\n\n\"It is gout,\" said the Professor.\n\n\"Oh, is that all?  It sounded much worse than that.\"\n\n\"It is a grave taint, but I trust that I shall not be a victim to\natavism.  I have laid these facts before you because they are factors\nwhich cannot be overlooked in forming your decision.  May I ask now\nwhether you see your way to accepting my proposal?\"\n\nHe paused in his walk, and looked earnestly and expectantly down at her.\n\nA struggle was evidently going on in her mind.  Her eyes were cast\ndown, her little slipper tapped the lawn, and her fingers played\nnervously with her chatelain.  Suddenly, with a sharp, quick gesture\nwhich had in it something of ABANDON and recklessness, she held out her\nhand to her companion.\n\n\"I accept,\" she said.\n\nThey were standing under the shadow of the hawthorn.  He stooped\ngravely down, and kissed her glove-covered fingers.\n\n\"I trust that you may never have cause to regret your decision,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I trust that you never may,\" she cried, with a heaving breast.\n\nThere were tears in her eyes, and her lips twitched with some strong\nemotion.\n\n\"Come into the sunshine again,\" said he.  \"It is the great restorative.\nYour nerves are shaken.  Some little congestion of the medulla and\npons.  It is always instructive to reduce psychic or emotional\nconditions to their physical equivalents.  You feel that your anchor is\nstill firm in a bottom of ascertained fact.\"\n\n\"But it is so dreadfully unromantic,\" said Mrs. O'James, with her old\ntwinkle.\n\n\"Romance is the offspring of imagination and of ignorance.  Where\nscience throws her calm, clear light there is happily no room for\nromance.\"\n\n\"But is not love romance?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not at all.  Love has been taken away from the poets, and has been\nbrought within the domain of true science.  It may prove to be one of\nthe great cosmic elementary forces.  When the atom of hydrogen draws\nthe atom of chlorine towards it to form the perfected molecule of\nhydrochloric acid, the force which it exerts may be intrinsically\nsimilar to that which draws me to you.  Attraction and repulsion appear\nto be the primary forces.  This is attraction.\"\n\n\"And here is repulsion,\" said Mrs. O'James, as a stout, florid lady\ncame sweeping across the lawn in their direction.  \"So glad you have\ncome out, Mrs. Esdaile!  Here is Professor Grey.\"\n\n\"How do you do, Professor?\" said the lady, with some little pomposity\nof manner.  \"You were very wise to stay out here on so lovely a day.\nIs it not heavenly?\"\n\n\"It is certainly very fine weather,\" the Professor answered.\n\n\"Listen to the wind sighing in the trees!\" cried Mrs. Esdaile, holding\nup one finger.  \"It is Nature's lullaby.  Could you not imagine it,\nProfessor Grey, to be the whisperings of angels?\"\n\n\"The idea had not occurred to me, madam.\"\n\n\"Ah, Professor, I have always the same complaint against you.  A want\nof rapport with the deeper meanings of nature.  Shall I say a want of\nimagination.  You do not feel an emotional thrill at the singing of\nthat thrush?\"\n\n\"I confess that I am not conscious of one, Mrs. Esdaile.\"\n\n\"Or at the delicate tint of that background of leaves?  See the rich\ngreens!\"\n\n\"Chlorophyll,\" murmured the Professor.\n\n\"Science is so hopelessly prosaic.  It dissects and labels, and loses\nsight of the great things in its attention to the little ones.  You\nhave a poor opinion of woman's intellect, Professor Grey.  I think that\nI have heard you say so.\"\n\n\"It is a question of avoirdupois,\" said the Professor, closing his eyes\nand shrugging his shoulders.  \"The female cerebrum averages two ounces\nless in weight than the male.  No doubt there are exceptions.  Nature\nis always elastic.\"\n\n\"But the heaviest thing is not always the strongest,\" said Mrs.\nO'James, laughing.  \"Isn't there a law of compensation in science?  May\nwe not hope to make up in quality for what we lack in quantity?\"\n\n\"I think not,\" remarked the Professor, gravely.  \"But there is your\nluncheon-gong.  No, thank you, Mrs. Esdaile, I cannot stay.  My\ncarriage is waiting.  Good-bye.  Good-bye, Mrs. O'James.\"\n\nHe raised his hat and stalked slowly away among the laurel bushes.\n\n\"He has no taste,\" said Mrs. Esdaile--\"no eye for beauty.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Mrs. O'James answered, with a saucy little jerk of\nthe chin.  \"He has just asked me to be his wife.\"\n\n\nAs Professor Ainslie Grey ascended the steps of his house, the\nhall-door opened and a dapper gentleman stepped briskly out.  He was\nsomewhat sallow in the face, with dark, beady eyes, and a short, black\nbeard with an aggressive bristle.  Thought and work had left their\ntraces upon his face, but he moved with the brisk activity of a man who\nhad not yet bade good-bye to his youth.\n\n\"I'm in luck's way,\" he cried.  \"I wanted to see you.\"\n\n\"Then come back into the library,\" said the Professor; \"you must stay\nand have lunch with us.\"\n\nThe two men entered the hall, and the Professor led the way into his\nprivate sanctum.  He motioned his companion into an arm-chair.\n\n\"I trust that you have been successful, O'Brien,\" said he.  \"I should\nbe loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister Ada; but I have\ngiven her to understand that there is no one whom I should prefer for a\nbrother-in-law to my most brilliant scholar, the author of Some Remarks\nupon the Bile-Pigments, with special reference to Urobilin.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Professor Grey--you have always been very kind,\"\nsaid the other.  \"I approached Miss Grey upon the subject; she did not\nsay No.\"\n\n\"She said Yes, then?\"\n\n\"No; she proposed to leave the matter open until my return from\nEdinburgh.  I go to-day, as you know, and I hope to commence my\nresearch to-morrow.\"\n\n\"On the comparative anatomy of the vermiform appendix, by James M'Murdo\nO'Brien,\" said the Professor, sonorously.  \"It is a glorious subject--a\nsubject which lies at the very root of evolutionary philosophy.\"\n\n\"Ah! she is the dearest girl,\" cried O'Brien, with a sudden little\nspurt of Celtic enthusiasm--\"she is the soul of truth and of honour.\"\n\n\"The vermiform appendix----\" began the Professor.\n\n\"She is an angel from heaven,\" interrupted the other.  \"I fear that it\nis my advocacy of scientific freedom in religious thought which stands\nin my way with her.\"\n\n\"You must not truckle upon that point.  You must be true to your\nconvictions; let there be no compromise there.\"\n\n\"My reason is true to agnosticism, and yet I am conscious of a void--a\nvacuum.  I had feelings at the old church at home between the scent of\nthe incense and the roll of the organ, such as I have never experienced\nin the laboratory or the lecture-room.\"\n\n\"Sensuous-purely sensuous,\" said the Professor, rubbing his chin.\n\"Vague hereditary tendencies stirred into life by the stimulation of\nthe nasal and auditory nerves.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, maybe so,\" the younger man answered thoughtfully.  \"But this\nwas not what I wished to speak to you about.  Before I enter your\nfamily, your sister and you have a claim to know all that I can tell\nyou about my career.  Of my worldly prospects I have already spoken to\nyou.  There is only one point which I have omitted to mention.  I am a\nwidower.\"\n\nThe Professor raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"This is news indeed,\" said he.\n\n\"I married shortly after my arrival in Australia.  Miss Thurston was\nher name.  I met her in society.  It was a most unhappy match.\"\n\nSome painful emotion possessed him.  His quick, expressive features\nquivered, and his white hands tightened upon the arms of the chair.\nThe Professor turned away towards the window.\n\n\"You are the best judge,\" he remarked \"but I should not think that it\nwas necessary to go into details.\"\n\n\"You have a right to know everything--you and Miss Grey.  It is not a\nmatter on which I can well speak to her direct.  Poor Jinny was the\nbest of women, but she was open to flattery, and liable to be misled by\ndesigning persons.  She was untrue to me, Grey.  It is a hard thing to\nsay of the dead, but she was untrue to me.  She fled to Auckland with a\nman whom she had known before her marriage.  The brig which carried\nthem foundered, and not a soul was saved.\"\n\n\"This is very painful, O'Brien,\" said the Professor, with a deprecatory\nmotion of his hand.  \"I cannot see, however, how it affects your\nrelation to my sister.\"\n\n\"I have eased my conscience,\" said O'Brien, rising from his chair; \"I\nhave told you all that there is to tell.  I should not like the story\nto reach you through any lips but my own.\"\n\n\"You are right, O'Brien.  Your action has been most honourable and\nconsiderate.  But you are not to blame in the matter, save that perhaps\nyou showed a little precipitancy in choosing a life-partner without due\ncare and inquiry.\"\n\nO'Brien drew his hand across his eyes.\n\n\"Poor girl!\" he cried.  \"God help me, I love her still!  But I must go.\"\n\n\"You will lunch with us?\"\n\n\"No, Professor; I have my packing still to do.  I have already bade\nMiss Grey adieu.  In two months I shall see you again.\"\n\n\"You will probably find me a married man.\"\n\n\"Married!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been thinking of it.\"\n\n\"My dear Professor, let me congratulate you with all my heart.  I had\nno idea.  Who is the lady?\"\n\n\"Mrs. O'James is her name--a widow of the same nationality as yourself.\nBut to return to matters of importance, I should be very happy to see\nthe proofs of your paper upon the vermiform appendix.  I may be able to\nfurnish you with material for a footnote or two.\"\n\n\"Your assistance will be invaluable to me,\" said O'Brien, with\nenthusiasm, and the two men parted in the hall.  The Professor walked\nback into the dining-room, where his sister was already seated at the\nluncheon-table.\n\n\"I shall be married at the registrar's,\" he remarked; \"I should\nstrongly recommend you to do the same.\"\n\nProfessor Ainslie Grey was as good as his word.  A fortnight's\ncessation of his classes gave him an opportunity which was too good to\nlet pass.  Mrs. O'James was an orphan, without relations and almost\nwithout friends in the country.  There was no obstacle in the way of a\nspeedy wedding.  They were married, accordingly, in the quietest manner\npossible, and went off to Cambridge together, where the Professor and\nhis charming wife were present at several academic observances, and\nvaried the routine of their honeymoon by incursions into biological\nlaboratories and medical libraries.  Scientific friends were loud in\ntheir congratulations, not only upon Mrs. Grey's beauty, but upon the\nunusual quickness and intelligence which she displayed in discussing\nphysiological questions.  The Professor was himself astonished at the\naccuracy of her information.  \"You have a remarkable range of knowledge\nfor a woman, Jeannette,\" he remarked upon more than one occasion.  He\nwas even prepared to admit that her cerebrum might be of the normal\nweight.\n\nOne foggy, drizzling morning they returned to Birchespool, for the next\nday would re-open the session, and Professor Ainslie Grey prided\nhimself upon having never once in his life failed to appear in his\nlecture-room at the very stroke of the hour.  Miss Ada Grey welcomed\nthem with a constrained cordiality, and handed over the keys of office\nto the new mistress.  Mrs. Grey pressed her warmly to remain, but she\nexplained that she had already accepted an invitation which would\nengage her for some months.  The same evening she departed for the\nsouth of England.\n\nA couple of days later the maid carried a card just after breakfast\ninto the library where the Professor sat revising his morning lecture.\nIt announced the re-arrival of Dr. James M'Murdo O'Brien.  Their\nmeeting was effusively genial on the part of the younger man, and\ncoldly precise on that of his former teacher.\n\n\"You see there have been changes,\" said the Professor.\n\n\"So I heard.  Miss Grey told me in her letters, and I read the notice\nin the British Medical Journal.  So it's really married you are.  How\nquickly and quietly you have managed it all!\"\n\n\"I am constitutionally averse to anything in the nature of show or\nceremony.  My wife is a sensible woman--I may even go the length of\nsaying that, for a woman, she is abnormally sensible.  She quite agreed\nwith me in the course which I have adopted.\"\n\n\"And your research on Vallisneria?\"\n\n\"This matrimonial incident has  interrupted  it, but I have resumed my\nclasses, and we shall soon be quite in harness again.\"\n\n\"I must see Miss Grey before I leave England.  We have corresponded,\nand I think that all will be well.  She must come out with me.  I don't\nthink I could go without her.\"\n\nThe Professor shook his head.\n\n\"Your nature is not so weak as you pretend,\" he said.  \"Questions of\nthis sort are, after all, quite subordinate to the great duties of\nlife.\"\n\nO'Brien smiled.\n\n\"You would have me take out my Celtic soul and put in a Saxon one,\" he\nsaid.  \"Either my brain is too small or my heart is too big.  But when\nmay I call and pay my respects to Mrs. Grey?  Will she be at home this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"She is at home now.  Come into the morning-room.  She will be glad to\nmake your acquaintance.\"\n\nThey walked across the linoleum-paved hall.  The Professor opened the\ndoor of the room, and walked in, followed by his friend.  Mrs. Grey was\nsitting in a basket-chair by the window, light and fairy-like in a\nloose-flowing, pink morning-gown.  Seeing a visitor, she rose and swept\ntowards them.  The Professor heard a dull thud behind him.  O'Brien had\nfallen back into a chair, with his hand pressed tight to his side.\n\n\"Jinny!\" he gasped--\"Jinny!\"\n\nMrs. Grey stopped dead in her advance, and stared at him with a face\nfrom which every expression had been struck out, save one of\nastonishment and horror.  Then with a sharp intaking of the breath she\nreeled, and would have fallen had the Professor not thrown his long,\nnervous arm round her.\n\n\"Try this sofa,\" said he.\n\nShe sank back among the cushions with the same white, cold, dead look\nupon her face.  The Professor stood with his back to the empty\nfireplace and glanced from the one to the other.\n\n\"So, O'Brien,\" he said at last, \"you have already made the acquaintance\nof my wife!\"\n\n\"Your wife,\" cried his friend hoarsely.  \"She is no wife of yours.  God\nhelp me, she is MY wife.\"\n\nThe Professor stood rigidly upon the hearthrug.  His long, thin fingers\nwere intertwined, and his head sunk a little forward.  His two\ncompanions had eyes only for each other.\n\n\"Jinny!\" said he.\n\n\"James!\"\n\n\"How could you leave me so, Jinny?  How could you have the heart to do\nit?  I thought you were dead.  I mourned for your death--ay, and you\nhave made me mourn for you living.  You have withered my life.\"\n\nShe made no answer, but lay back among her cushions with her eyes still\nfixed upon him.\n\n\"Why do you not speak?\"\n\n\"Because you are right, James.  I HAVE treated you cruelly--shamefully.\nBut it is not as bad as you think.\"\n\n\"You fled with De Horta.\"\n\n\"No, I did not.  At the last moment my better nature prevailed.  He\nwent alone.  But I was ashamed to come back after what I had written to\nyou.  I could not face you.  I took passage alone to England under a\nnew name, and here I have lived ever since.  It seemed to me that I was\nbeginning life again.  I knew that you thought I was drowned.  Who\ncould have dreamed that fate would throw us together again!  When the\nProfessor asked me----\"\n\nShe stopped and gave a gasp for breath.\n\n\"You are faint,\"  said the Professor--\"keep the head low; it aids the\ncerebral circulation.\"  He flattened down the cushion.  \"I am sorry to\nleave you, O'Brien; but I have my class duties to look to.  Possibly I\nmay find you here when I return.\"\n\nWith a grim and rigid face he strode out of the room.  Not one of the\nthree hundred students who listened to his lecture saw any change in\nhis manner and appearance, or could have guessed that the austere\ngentleman in front of them had found out at last how hard it is to rise\nabove one's humanity.  The lecture over, he performed his routine\nduties in the laboratory, and then drove back to his own house.  He did\nnot enter by the front door, but passed through the garden to the\nfolding glass casement which led out of the morning-room.  As he\napproached he heard his wife's voice and O'Brien's in loud and animated\ntalk.  He paused among the rose-bushes, uncertain whether to interrupt\nthem or no.  Nothing was further from his nature than play the\neavesdropper; but as he stood, still hesitating, words fell upon his\near which struck him rigid and motionless.\n\n\"You are still my wife, Jinny,\" said O'Brien; \"I forgive you from the\nbottom of my heart.  I love you, and I have never ceased to love you,\nthough you had forgotten me.\"\n\n\"No, James, my heart was always in Melbourne.  I have always been\nyours.  I thought that it was better for you that I should seem to be\ndead.\"\n\n\"You must choose between us now, Jinny.  If you determine to remain\nhere, I shall not open my lips.  There shall be no scandal.  If, on the\nother hand, you come with me, it's little I care about the world's\nopinion.  Perhaps I am as much to blame as you.  I thought too much of\nmy work and too little of my wife.\"\n\nThe Professor heard the cooing, caressing laugh which he knew so well.\n\n\"I shall go with you, James,\" she said.\n\n\"And the Professor----?\"\n\n\"The poor Professor!  But he will not mind much, James; he has no\nheart.\"\n\n\"We must tell him our resolution.\"\n\n\"There is no need,\" said Professor Ainslie Grey, stepping in through\nthe open casement.  \"I have overheard the latter part of your\nconversation.  I hesitated to interrupt you before you came to a\nconclusion.\"\n\nO'Brien stretched out his hand and took that of the woman.  They stood\ntogether with the sunshine on their faces.  The Professor paused at the\ncasement with his hands behind his back, and his long black shadow fell\nbetween them.\n\n\"You have come to a wise decision,\" said he.  \"Go back to Australia\ntogether, and let what has passed be blotted out of your lives.\"\n\n\"But you--you----\" stammered O'Brien.\n\nThe Professor waved his hand.\n\n\"Never trouble about me,\" he said.\n\nThe woman gave a gasping cry.\n\n\"What can I do or say?\" she wailed.  \"How could I have foreseen this?\nI thought my old life was dead.  But it has come back again, with all\nits hopes and its desires.  What can I say to you, Ainslie?  I have\nbrought shame and disgrace upon a worthy man.  I have blasted your\nlife.  How you must hate and loathe me!  I wish to God that I had never\nbeen born!\"\n\n\"I neither hate nor loathe you, Jeannette,\" said the Professor,\nquietly.  \"You are wrong in regretting your birth, for you have a\nworthy mission before you in aiding the life-work of a man who has\nshown himself capable of the highest order of scientific research.  I\ncannot with justice blame you personally for what has occurred.  How\nfar the individual monad is to be held responsible for hereditary and\nengrained tendencies, is a question upon which science has not yet said\nher last word.\"\n\nHe stood with his finger-tips touching, and his body inclined as one\nwho is gravely expounding a difficult and impersonal subject.  O'Brien\nhad stepped forward to say something, but the other's attitude and\nmanner froze the words upon his lips.  Condolence or sympathy would be\nan impertinence to one who could so easily merge his private griefs in\nbroad questions of abstract philosophy.\n\n\"It is needless to prolong the situation,\" the Professor continued, in\nthe same measured tones.  \"My brougham stands at the door.  I beg that\nyou will use it as your own.  Perhaps it would be as well that you\nshould leave the town without unnecessary delay.  Your things,\nJeannette, shall be forwarded.\"\n\nO'Brien hesitated with a hanging head.\n\n\"I hardly dare offer you my hand,\" he said.\n\n\"On the contrary.  I think that of the three of us you come best out of\nthe affair.  You have nothing to be ashamed of.\"\n\n\"Your sister----\"\n\n\"I shall see that the matter is put to her in its true light.\nGood-bye!  Let me have a copy of your recent research.  Good-bye,\nJeannette!\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\"\n\nTheir hands met, and for one short moment their eyes also.  It was only\na glance, but for the first and last time the woman's intuition cast a\nlight for itself into the dark places of a strong man's soul.  She gave\na little gasp, and her other hand rested for an instant, as white and\nas light as thistle-down, upon his shoulder.\n\n\"James, James!\" she cried.  \"Don't you see that he is stricken to the\nheart?\"\n\nHe turned her quietly away from him.\n\n\"I am not an emotional man,\" he said. \"I have my duties--my research on\nVallisneria.  The brougham is there.  Your cloak is in the hall.  Tell\nJohn where you wish to be driven.  He will bring you anything you need.\nNow go.\"\n\nHis last two words were so sudden, so volcanic, in such contrast to his\nmeasured voice and mask-like face, that they swept the two away from\nhim.  He closed the door behind them and paced slowly up and down the\nroom.  Then he passed into the library and looked out over the wire\nblind.  The carriage was rolling away.  He caught a last glimpse of the\nwoman who had been his wife.  He saw the feminine droop of her head,\nand the curve of her beautiful throat.\n\nUnder some foolish, aimless impulse, he took a few quick steps towards\nthe door.  Then he turned, and throwing himself into his study-chair he\nplunged back into his work.\n\n\nThere was little scandal about this singular domestic incident.  The\nProfessor had few personal friends, and seldom went into society.  His\nmarriage had been so quiet that most of his colleagues had never ceased\nto regard him as a bachelor.  Mrs. Esdaile and a few others might talk,\nbut their field for gossip was limited, for they could only guess\nvaguely at the cause of this sudden separation.\n\nThe Professor was as punctual as ever at his classes, and as zealous in\ndirecting the laboratory work of those who studied under him.  His own\nprivate researches were pushed on with feverish energy.  It was no\nuncommon thing for his servants, when they came down of a morning, to\nhear the shrill scratchings of his tireless pen, or to meet him on the\nstaircase as he ascended, grey and silent, to his room.  In vain his\nfriends assured him that such a life must undermine his health.  He\nlengthened his hours until day and night were one long, ceaseless task.\n\nGradually under this discipline a change came over his appearance.  His\nfeatures, always inclined to gauntness, became even sharper and more\npronounced.  There were deep lines about his temples and across his\nbrow.  His cheek was sunken and his complexion bloodless.  His knees\ngave under him when he walked; and once when passing out of his\nlecture-room he fell and had to be assisted to his carriage.\n\nThis was just before the end of the session and soon after the holidays\ncommenced the professors who still remained in Birchespool were shocked\nto hear that their brother of the chair of physiology had sunk so low\nthat no hopes could be entertained of his recovery.  Two eminent\nphysicians had consulted over his case without being able to give a\nname to the affection from which he suffered.  A steadily decreasing\nvitality appeared to be the only symptom--a bodily weakness which left\nthe mind unclouded.  He was much interested himself in his own case,\nand made notes of his subjective sensations as an aid to diagnosis.  Of\nhis approaching end he spoke in his usual unemotional and somewhat\npedantic fashion.  \"It is the assertion,\" he said, \"of the liberty of\nthe individual cell as opposed to the cell-commune.  It is the\ndissolution of a co-operative society.  The process is one of great\ninterest.\"\n\nAnd so one grey morning his co-operative society dissolved.  Very\nquietly and softly he sank into his eternal sleep.  His two physicians\nfelt some slight embarrassment when called upon to fill in his\ncertificate.\n\n\"It is difficult to give it a name,\" said one.\n\n\"Very,\" said the other.\n\n\"If he were not such an unemotional man, I should have said that he had\ndied from some sudden nervous shock--from, in fact, what the vulgar\nwould call a broken heart.\"\n\n\"I don't think poor Grey was that sort of a man at all.\"\n\n\"Let us call it cardiac, anyhow,\" said the older physician.\n\nSo they did so.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASE OF LADY SANNOX.\n\nThe relations between Douglas Stone and the notorious Lady Sannox were\nvery well known both among the fashionable circles of which she was a\nbrilliant member, and the scientific bodies which numbered him among\ntheir most illustrious confreres.  There was naturally, therefore, a\nvery widespread interest when it was announced one morning that the\nlady had absolutely and for ever taken the veil, and that the world\nwould see her no more.  When, at the very tail of this rumour, there\ncame the assurance that the celebrated operating surgeon, the man of\nsteel nerves, had been found in the morning by his valet, seated on one\nside of his bed, smiling pleasantly upon the universe, with both legs\njammed into one side of his breeches and his great brain about as\nvaluable as a cap full of porridge, the matter was strong enough to\ngive quite a little thrill of interest to folk who had never hoped that\ntheir jaded nerves were capable of such a sensation.\n\nDouglas Stone in his prime was one of the most remarkable men in\nEngland.  Indeed, he could hardly be said to have ever reached his\nprime, for he was but nine-and-thirty at the time of this little\nincident.  Those who knew him best were aware that, famous as he was as\na surgeon, he might have succeeded with even greater rapidity in any of\na dozen lines of life.  He could have cut his way to fame as a soldier,\nstruggled to it as an explorer, bullied for it in the courts, or built\nit out of stone and iron as an engineer.  He was born to be great, for\nhe could plan what another man dare not do, and he could do what\nanother man dare not plan.  In surgery none could follow him.  His\nnerve, his judgment, his intuition, were things apart.  Again and again\nhis knife cut away death, but grazed the very springs of life in doing\nit, until his assistants were as white as the patient.  His energy, his\naudacity, his full-blooded self-confidence--does not the memory of them\nstill linger to the south of Marylebone Road and the north of Oxford\nStreet?\n\nHis vices were as magnificent as his virtues, and infinitely more\npicturesque.  Large as was his income, and it was the third largest of\nall professional men in London, it was far beneath the luxury of his\nliving.  Deep in his complex nature lay a rich vein of sensualism, at\nthe sport of which he placed all the prizes of his life.  The eye, the\near, the touch, the palate--all were his masters.  The bouquet of old\nvintages, the scent of rare exotics, the curves and tints of the\ndaintiest potteries of Europe--it was to these that the quick-running\nstream of gold was transformed.  And then there came his sudden mad\npassion for Lady Sannox, when a single interview with two challenging\nglances and a whispered word set him ablaze.  She was the loveliest\nwoman in London, and the only one to him.  He was one of the handsomest\nmen in London, but not the only one to her.  She had a liking for new\nexperiences, and was gracious to most men who wooed her.  It may have\nbeen cause or it may have been effect that Lord Sannox looked fifty,\nthough he was but six-and-thirty.\n\nHe was a quiet, silent, neutral-tinted man, this lord, with thin lips\nand heavy eyelids, much given to gardening, and full of home-like\nhabits.  He had at one time been fond of acting, had even rented a\ntheatre in London, and on its boards had first seen Miss Marion Dawson,\nto whom he had offered his hand, his title, and the third of a county.\nSince his marriage this early hobby had become distasteful to him.\nEven in private theatricals it was no longer possible to persuade him\nto exercise the talent which he had often shown that he possessed.  He\nwas happier with a spud and a watering-can among his orchids and\nchrysanthemums.\n\nIt was quite an interesting problem whether he was absolutely devoid of\nsense, or miserably wanting in spirit.  Did he know his lady's ways and\ncondone them, or was he a mere blind, doting fool?  It was a point to\nbe discussed over the teacups in snug little drawing-rooms, or with the\naid of a cigar in the bow windows of clubs.  Bitter and plain were the\ncomments among men upon his conduct.  There was but one who had a good\nword to say for him, and he was the most silent member in the\nsmoking-room.  He had seen him break in a horse at the university, and\nit seemed to have left an impression upon his mind.\n\nBut when Douglas Stone became the favourite, all doubts as to Lord\nSannox's knowledge or ignorance were set for ever at rest.  There, was\nno subterfuge about Stone.  In his high-handed, impetuous fashion, he\nset all caution and discretion at defiance.  The scandal became\nnotorious.  A learned body intimated that his name had been struck from\nthe list of its vice-presidents.  Two friends implored him to consider\nhis professional credit.  He cursed them all three, and spent forty\nguineas on a bangle to take with him to the lady.  He was at her house\nevery evening, and she drove in his carriage in the afternoons.  There\nwas not an attempt on either side to conceal their relations; but there\ncame at last a little incident to interrupt them.\n\nIt was a dismal winter's night, very cold and gusty, with the wind\nwhooping in the chimneys and blustering against the window-panes.  A\nthin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the\ngale, drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eves.\nDouglas Stone had finished his dinner, and sat by his fire in the\nstudy, a glass of rich port upon the malachite table at his elbow.  As\nhe raised it to his lips, he held it up against the lamplight, and\nwatched with the eye of a connoisseur the tiny scales of beeswing which\nfloated in its rich ruby depths.  The fire, as it spurted up, threw\nfitful lights upon his bold, clear-cut face, with its widely-opened\ngrey eyes, its thick and yet firm lips, and the deep, square jaw, which\nhad something Roman in its strength and its animalism.  He smiled from\ntime to time as he nestled back in his luxurious chair.  Indeed, he had\na right to feel well pleased, for, against the advice of six\ncolleagues, he had performed an operation that day of which only two\ncases were on record, and the result had been brilliant beyond all\nexpectation.  No other man in London would have had the daring to plan,\nor the skill to execute, such a heroic measure.\n\nBut he had promised Lady Sannox to see her that evening and it was\nalready half-past eight.  His hand was outstretched to the bell to\norder the carriage when he heard the dull thud of the knocker.  An\ninstant later there was the shuffling of feet in the hall, and the\nsharp closing of a door.\n\n\"A patient to see you, sir, in the consulting-room, said the butler.\n\n\"About himself?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I think he wants you to go out.\"\n\n\"It is too late,\" cried Douglas Stone peevishly.  \"I won't go.\"\n\n\"This is his card, sir.\"\n\nThe butler presented it upon the gold salver which had been given to\nhis master by the wife of a Prime Minister.\n\n\"'Hamil Ali, Smyrna.'  Hum!  The fellow is a Turk, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  He seems as if he came from abroad, sir.  And he's in a\nterrible way.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!  I have an engagement.  I must go somewhere else.  But I'll\nsee him.  Show him in here, Pim.\"\n\nA few moments later the butler swung open the door and ushered in a\nsmall and decrepit man, who walked with a bent back and with the\nforward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with extreme\nshort sight.  His face was swarthy, and his hair and beard of the\ndeepest black.  In one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped\nwith red, in the other a small chamois leather bag.\n\n\"Good-evening,\" said Douglas Stone, when the butler had closed the\ndoor.  \"You speak English, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I am from Asia Minor, but I speak English when I speak\nslow.\"\n\n\"You wanted me to go out, I understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I wanted very much that you should see my wife.\"\n\n\"I could come in the morning, but I have an engagement which prevents\nme from seeing your wife to-night.\"\n\nThe Turk's answer was a singular one.  He pulled the string which\nclosed the mouth of the chamois leather bag, and poured a flood of gold\non to the table.\n\n\"There are one hundred pounds there,\" said he, \"and I promise you that\nit will not take you an hour.  I have a cab ready at the door.\"\n\nDouglas Stone glanced at his watch.  An hour would not make it too late\nto visit Lady Sannox.  He had been there later.  And the fee was an\nextraordinarily high one.  He had been pressed by his creditors lately,\nand he could not afford to let such a chance pass.  He would go.\n\n\"What is the case?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, it is so sad a one!  So sad a one!  You have not, perhaps, heard\nof the daggers of the Almohades?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Ah, they are Eastern daggers of a great age and of a singular shape,\nwith the hilt like what you call a stirrup.  I am a curiosity dealer,\nyou understand, and that is why I have come to England from Smyrna, but\nnext week I go back once more.  Many things I brought with me, and I\nhave a few things left, but among them, to my sorrow, is one of these\ndaggers.\"\n\n\"You will remember that I have an appointment, sir,\" said the surgeon,\nwith some irritation.  \"Pray confine yourself to the necessary details.\"\n\n\"You will see that it is necessary.  To-day my wife fell down in a\nfaint in the room in which I keep my wares, and she cut her lower lip\nupon this cursed dagger of Almohades.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Douglas Stone, rising.  \"And you wish me to dress the\nwound?\"\n\n\"No, no, it is worse than that.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"These daggers are poisoned.\"\n\n\"Poisoned!\"\n\n\"Yes, and there is no man, East or West, who can tell now what is the\npoison or what the cure.  But all that is known I know, for my father\nwas in this trade before me, and we have had much to do with these\npoisoned weapons.\"\n\n\"What are the symptoms?\"\n\n\"Deep sleep, and death in thirty hours.\"\n\n\"And you say there is no cure.  Why then should you pay me this\nconsiderable fee?\"\n\n\"No drug can cure, but the knife may.\"\n\n\"And how?\"\n\n\"The poison is slow of absorption.  It remains for hours in the wound.\"\n\n\"Washing, then, might cleanse it?\"\n\n\"No more than in a snake-bite.  It is too subtle and too deadly.\"\n\n\"Excision of the wound, then?\"\n\n\"That is it.  If it be on the finger, take the finger off.  So said my\nfather always.  But think of where this wound is, and that it is my\nwife.  It is dreadful!\"\n\nBut familiarity with such grim matters may take the finer edge from a\nman's sympathy.  To Douglas Stone this was already an interesting case,\nand he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble objections of the husband.\n\n\"It appears to be that or nothing,\" said he brusquely.  \"It is better\nto lose a lip than a life.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I know that you are right.  Well, well, it is kismet, and\nmust be faced.  I have the cab, and you will come with me and do this\nthing.\"\n\nDouglas Stone took his case of bistouries from a drawer, and placed it\nwith a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in his pocket.  He must\nwaste no more time if he were to see Lady Sannox.\n\n\"I am ready,\" said he, pulling on his overcoat.  \"Will you take a glass\nof wine before you go out into this cold air?\"\n\nHis visitor shrank away, with a protesting hand upraised.\n\n\"You forget that I am a Mussulman, and a true follower of the Prophet,\"\nsaid he.  \"But tell me what is the bottle of green glass which you have\nplaced in your pocket?\"\n\n\"It is chloroform.\"\n\n\"Ah, that also is forbidden to us.  It is a spirit, and we make no use\nof such things.\"\n\n\"What!  You would allow your wife to go through an operation without an\nanaesthetic?\"\n\n\"Ah! she will feel nothing, poor soul.  The deep sleep has already come\non, which is the first working of the poison.  And then I have given\nher of our Smyrna opium.  Come, sir, for already an hour has passed.\"\n\nAs they stepped out into the darkness, a sheet of rain was driven in\nupon their faces, and the hall lamp, which dangled from the arm of a\nmarble caryatid, went out with a fluff.  Pim, the butler, pushed the\nheavy door to, straining hard with his shoulder against the wind, while\nthe two men groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed\nwhere the cab was waiting.  An instant later they were rattling upon\ntheir journey.\n\n\"Is it far?\" asked Douglas Stone.\n\n\"Oh, no.  We have a very little quiet place off the Euston Road.\"\n\nThe surgeon pressed the spring of his repeater and listened to the\nlittle tings which told him the hour.  It was a quarter past nine.  He\ncalculated the distances, and the short time which it would take him to\nperform so trivial an operation.  He ought to reach Lady Sannox by ten\no'clock.  Through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gas-lamps\ndancing past, with occasionally the broader glare of a shop front.  The\nrain was pelting and rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage and\nthe wheels swashed as they rolled through puddle and mud.  Opposite to\nhim the white headgear of his companion gleamed faintly through the\nobscurity.  The surgeon felt in his pockets and arranged his needles,\nhis ligatures and his safety-pins, that no time might be wasted when\nthey arrived.  He chafed with impatience and drummed his foot upon the\nfloor.\n\nBut the cab slowed down at last and pulled up.  In an instant Douglas\nStone was out, and the Smyrna merchant's toe was at his very heel.\n\n\"You can wait,\" said he to the driver.\n\nIt was a mean-looking house in a narrow and sordid street.  The\nsurgeon, who knew his London well, cast a swift glance into the\nshadows, but there was nothing distinctive--no shop, no movement,\nnothing but a double line of dull, flat-faced houses, a double stretch\nof wet flagstones which gleamed in the lamplight, and a double rush of\nwater in the gutters which swirled and gurgled towards the sewer\ngratings.  The door which faced them was blotched and discoloured, and\na faint light in the fan pane above it served to show the dust and the\ngrime which covered it.  Above, in one of the bedroom windows, there\nwas a dull yellow glimmer.  The merchant knocked loudly, and, as he\nturned his dark face towards the light, Douglas Stone could see that it\nwas contracted with anxiety.  A bolt was drawn, and an elderly woman\nwith a taper stood in the doorway, shielding the thin flame with her\ngnarled hand.\n\n\"Is all well?\" gasped the merchant.\n\n\"She is as you left her, sir.\"\n\n\"She has not spoken?\"\n\n\"No; she is in a deep sleep.\"\n\nThe merchant closed the door, and Douglas Stone walked down the narrow\npassage, glancing about him in some surprise as he did so.  There was\nno oilcloth, no mat, no hat-rack.  Deep grey dust and heavy festoons of\ncobwebs met his eyes everywhere.  Following the old woman up the\nwinding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent\nhouse.  There was no carpet.\n\nThe bedroom was on the second landing.  Douglas Stone followed the old\nnurse into it, with the merchant at his heels.  Here, at least, there\nwas furniture and to spare.  The floor was littered and the corners\npiled with Turkish cabinets, inlaid tables, coats of chain mail,\nstrange pipes, and grotesque weapons.  A single small lamp stood upon a\nbracket on the wall.  Douglas Stone took it down, and picking his way\namong the lumber, walked over to a couch in the corner, on which lay a\nwoman dressed in the Turkish fashion, with yashmak and veil.  The lower\npart of the face was exposed, and the surgeon saw a jagged cut which\nzigzagged along the border of the under lip.\n\n\"You will forgive the yashmak,\" said the Turk.  \"You know our views\nabout woman in the East.\"\n\nBut the surgeon was not thinking about the yashmak.  This was no longer\na woman to him.  It was a case.  He stooped and examined the wound\ncarefully.\n\n\"There are no signs of irritation,\" said he.  \"We might delay the\noperation until local symptoms develop.\"\n\nThe husband wrung his hands in incontrollable agitation.\n\n\"Oh! sir, sir!\" he cried.  \"Do not trifle. You do not know.  It is\ndeadly.  I know, and I give you my assurance that an operation is\nabsolutely necessary.  Only the knife can save her.\"\n\n\"And yet I am inclined to wait,\" said Douglas Stone.\n\n\"That is enough!\" the Turk cried, angrily.  \"Every minute is of\nimportance, and I cannot stand here and see my wife allowed to sink.\nIt only remains for me to give you my thanks for having come, and to\ncall in some other surgeon before it is too late.\"\n\nDouglas Stone hesitated.  To refund that hundred pounds was no pleasant\nmatter.  But of course if he left the case he must return the money.\nAnd if the Turk were right and the woman died, his position before a\ncoroner might be an embarrassing one.\n\n\"You have had personal experience of this poison?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And you assure me that an operation is needful.\"\n\n\"I swear it by all that I hold sacred.\"\n\n\"The disfigurement will be frightful.\"\n\n\"I can understand that the mouth will not be a pretty one to kiss.\"\n\nDouglas Stone turned fiercely upon the man.  The speech was a brutal\none.  But the Turk has his own fashion of talk and of thought, and\nthere was no time for wrangling.  Douglas Stone drew a bistoury from\nhis case, opened it and felt the keen straight edge with his\nforefinger.  Then he held the lamp closer to the bed.  Two dark eyes\nwere gazing up at him through the slit in the yashmak.  They were all\niris, and the pupil was hardly to be seen.\n\n\"You have given her a very heavy dose of opium.\"\n\n\"Yes, she has had a good dose.\"\n\nHe glanced again at the dark eyes which looked straight at his own.\nThey were dull and lustreless, but, even as he gazed, a little shifting\nsparkle came into them, and the lips quivered.\n\n\"She is not absolutely unconscious,\" said he.\n\n\"Would it not be well to use the knife while it would be painless?\"\n\nThe same thought had crossed the surgeon's mind.  He grasped the\nwounded lip with his forceps, and with two swift cuts he took out a\nbroad V-shaped piece.  The woman sprang up on the couch with a dreadful\ngurgling scream.  Her covering was torn from her face.  It was a face\nthat he knew.  In spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber\nof blood, it was a face that he knew.  She kept on putting her hand up\nto the gap and screaming.  Douglas Stone sat down at the foot of the\ncouch with his knife and his forceps.  The room was whirling round, and\nhe had felt something go like a ripping seam behind his ear.  A\nbystander would have said that his face was the more ghastly of the\ntwo.  As in a dream, or as if he had been looking at something at the\nplay, he was conscious that the Turk's hair and beard lay upon the\ntable, and that Lord Sannox was leaning against the wall with his hand\nto his side, laughing silently.  The screams had died away now, and the\ndreadful head had dropped back again upon the pillow, but Douglas Stone\nstill sat motionless, and Lord Sannox still chuckled quietly to himself.\n\n\"It was really very necessary for Marion, this operation,\" said he,\n\"not physically, but morally, you know, morally.\"\n\nDouglas Stone stooped forwards and began to play with the fringe of the\ncoverlet.  His knife tinkled down upon the ground, but he still held\nthe forceps and something more.\n\n\"I had long intended to make a little example,\" said Lord Sannox,\nsuavely.  \"Your note of Wednesday miscarried, and I have it here in my\npocket-book.  I took some pains in carrying out my idea.  The wound, by\nthe way, was from nothing more dangerous than my signet ring.\"\n\nHe glanced keenly at his silent companion, and cocked the small\nrevolver which he held in his coat pocket.  But Douglas Stone was still\npicking at the coverlet.\n\n\"You see you have kept your appointment after all,\" said Lord Sannox.\n\nAnd at that Douglas Stone began to laugh.  He laughed long and loudly.\nBut Lord Sannox did not laugh now.  Something like fear sharpened and\nhardened his features.  He walked from the room, and he walked on\ntiptoe.  The old woman was waiting outside.\n\n\"Attend to your mistress when she awakes,\" said Lord Sannox.\n\nThen he went down to the street.  The cab was at the door, and the\ndriver raised his hand to his hat.\n\n\"John,\" said Lord Sannox, \"you will take the doctor home first.  He\nwill want leading downstairs, I think.  Tell his butler that he has\nbeen taken ill at a case.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you can take Lady Sannox home.\"\n\n\"And how about yourself, sir?\"\n\n\"Oh, my address for the next few months will be Hotel di Roma, Venice.\nJust see that the letters are sent on.  And tell Stevens to exhibit all\nthe purple chrysanthemums next Monday and to wire me the result.\"\n\n\n\n\nA QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY.\n\nThe Foreign Minister was down with the gout.  For a week he had been\nconfined to the house, and he had missed two Cabinet Councils at a time\nwhen the pressure upon his department was severe.  It is true that he\nhad an excellent undersecretary and an admirable staff, but the\nMinister was a man of such ripe experience and of such proven sagacity\nthat things halted in his absence.  When his firm hand was at the wheel\nthe great ship of State rode easily and smoothly upon her way; when it\nwas removed she yawed and staggered until twelve British editors rose\nup in their omniscience and traced out twelve several courses, each of\nwhich was the sole and only path to safety.  Then it was that the\nOpposition said vain things, and that the harassed Prime Minister\nprayed for his absent colleague.\n\nThe Foreign Minister sat in his dressing-room in the great house in\nCavendish Square.  It was May, and the square garden shot up like a\nveil of green in front of his window, but, in spite of the sunshine, a\nfire crackled and sputtered in the grate of the sick-room.  In a\ndeep-red plush armchair sat the great statesman, his head leaning back\nupon a silken pillow, one foot stretched forward and supported upon a\npadded rest.  His deeply-lined, finely-chiselled face and slow-moving,\nheavily-pouched eyes were turned upwards towards the carved and painted\nceiling, with that inscrutable expression which had been the despair\nand the admiration of his Continental colleagues upon the occasion of\nthe famous Congress when he had made his first appearance in the arena\nof European diplomacy.  Yet at the present moment his capacity for\nhiding his emotions had for the instant failed him, for about the lines\nof his strong, straight mouth and the puckers of his broad, overhanging\nforehead, there were sufficient indications of the restlessness and\nimpatience which consumed him.\n\nAnd indeed there was enough to make a man chafe, for he had much to\nthink of and yet was bereft of the power of thought.  There was, for\nexample, that question of the Dobrutscha and the navigation of the\nmouths of the Danube which was ripe for settlement.  The Russian\nChancellor had sent a masterly statement upon the subject, and it was\nthe pet ambition of our Minister to answer it in a worthy fashion.\nThen there was the blockade of Crete, and the British fleet lying off\nCape Matapan, waiting for instructions which might change the course of\nEuropean history.  And there were those three unfortunate Macedonian\ntourists, whose friends were momentarily expecting to receive their\nears or their fingers in default of the exorbitant ransom which had\nbeen demanded.  They must be plucked out of those mountains, by force\nor by diplomacy, or an outraged public would vent its wrath upon\nDowning Street.  All these questions pressed for a solution, and yet\nhere was the Foreign Minister of England, planted in an arm-chair, with\nhis whole thoughts and attention riveted upon the ball of his right\ntoe!  It was humiliating--horribly humiliating!  His reason revolted at\nit.  He had been a respecter of himself, a respecter of his own will;\nbut what sort of a machine was it which could be utterly thrown out of\ngear by a little piece of inflamed gristle?  He groaned and writhed\namong his cushions.\n\nBut, after all, was it quite impossible that he should go down to the\nHouse?  Perhaps the doctor was exaggerating the situation.  There was a\nCabinet Council that day.  He glanced at his watch.  It must be nearly\nover by now.  But at least he might perhaps venture to drive down as\nfar as Westminster.  He pushed back the little round table with its\nbristle of medicine-bottles, and levering himself up with a hand upon\neither arm of the chair, he clutched a thick oak stick and hobbled\nslowly across the room.  For a moment as he moved, his energy of mind\nand body seemed to return to him.  The British fleet should sail from\nMatapan.  Pressure should be brought to bear upon the Turks.  The\nGreeks should be shown--Ow!  In an instant the Mediterranean was\nblotted out, and nothing remained but that huge, undeniable, intrusive,\nred-hot toe.  He staggered to the window and rested his left hand upon\nthe ledge, while he propped himself upon his stick with his right.\nOutside lay the bright, cool, square garden, a few well-dressed\npassers-by, and a single, neatly-appointed carriage, which was driving\naway from his own door.  His quick eye caught the coat-of-arms on the\npanel, and his lips set for a moment and his bushy eyebrows gathered\nominously with a deep furrow between them.  He hobbled back to his seat\nand struck the gong which stood upon the table.\n\n\"Your mistress!\" said he as the serving-man entered.\n\nIt was clear that it was impossible to think of going to the House.\nThe shooting up his leg warned him that his doctor had not\noverestimated the situation.  But he had a little mental worry now\nwhich had for the moment eclipsed his physical ailments.  He tapped the\nground impatiently with his stick until the door of the dressing-room\nswung open, and a tall, elegant lady of rather more than middle age\nswept into the chamber.  Her hair was touched with grey, but her calm,\nsweet face had all the freshness of youth, and her gown of green shot\nplush, with a sparkle of gold passementerie at her bosom and shoulders,\nshowed off the lines of her fine figure to their best advantage.\n\n\"You sent for me, Charles?\"\n\n\"Whose carriage was that which drove away just now?\"\n\n\"Oh, you've been up!\" she cried, shaking an admonitory forefinger.\n\"What an old dear it is!  How can you be so rash?  What am I to say to\nSir William when he comes?  You know that he gives up his cases when\nthey are insubordinate.\"\n\n\"In this instance the case may give him up,\" said the Minister,\npeevishly; \"but I must beg, Clara, that you will answer my question.\"\n\n\"Oh! the carriage!  It must have been Lord Arthur Sibthorpe's.\"\n\n\"I saw the three chevrons upon the panel,\" muttered the invalid.\n\nHis lady had pulled herself a little straighter and opened her large\nblue eyes.\n\n\"Then why ask?\" she said.  \"One might almost think, Charles, that you\nwere laying a trap!  Did you expect that I should deceive you?  You\nhave not had your lithia powder.\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, leave it alone!  I asked because I was surprised\nthat Lord Arthur should call here.  I should have fancied, Clara, that\nI had made myself sufficiently clear on that point.  Who received him?\"\n\n\"I did.  That is, I and Ida.\"\n\n\"I will not have him brought into contact with Ida.  I do not approve\nof it.  The matter has gone too far already.\"\n\nLady Clara seated herself on a velvet-topped footstool, and bent her\nstately figure over the Minister's hand, which she patted softly\nbetween her own.\n\n\"Now you have said it, Charles,\" said she.  \"It has gone too far--I\ngive you my word, dear, that I never suspected it until it was past all\nmending.  I may be to blame--no doubt I am; but it was all so sudden.\nThe tail end of the season and a week at Lord Donnythorne's.  That was\nall.  But oh!  Charlie, she loves him so, and she is our only one!  How\ncan we make her miserable?\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" cried the Minister impatiently, slapping on the plush arm\nof his chair.  \"This is too much.  I tell you, Clara, I give you my\nword, that all my official duties, all the affairs of this great\nempire, do not give me the trouble that Ida does.\"\n\n\"But she is our only one, Charles.\"\n\n\"The more reason that she should not make a mesalliance.\"\n\n\"Mesalliance, Charles!  Lord Arthur Sibthorpe, son of the Duke of\nTavistock, with a pedigree from the Heptarchy.  Debrett takes them\nright back to Morcar, Earl of Northumberland.\"\n\nThe Minister shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Lord Arthur is the fourth son of the poorest duke in England,\" said\nhe.  \"He has neither prospects nor profession.\"\n\n\"But, oh! Charlie, you could find him both.\"\n\n\"I do not like him.  I do not care for the connection.\"\n\n\"But consider Ida!  You know how frail her health is.  Her whole soul\nis set upon him.  You would not have the heart, Charles, to separate\nthem?\"\n\nThere was a tap at the door.  Lady Clara swept towards it and threw it\nopen.\n\n\"Yes, Thomas?\"\n\n\"If you please, my lady, the Prime Minister is below.\"\n\n\"Show him up, Thomas.\"\n\n\"Now, Charlie, you must not excite yourself over public matters.  Be\nvery good and cool and reasonable, like a darling.  I am sure that I\nmay trust you.\"\n\nShe threw her light shawl round the invalid's shoulders, and slipped\naway into the bed-room as the great man was ushered in at the door of\nthe dressing-room.\n\n\"My dear Charles,\" said he cordially, stepping into the room with all\nthe boyish briskness for which he was famous, \"I trust that you find\nyourself a little better.  Almost ready for harness, eh?  We miss you\nsadly, both in the House and in the Council.  Quite a storm brewing\nover this Grecian business.  The Times took a nasty line this morning.\"\n\n\"So I saw,\" said the invalid, smiling up at his chief.  \"Well, well, we\nmust let them see that the country is not entirely ruled from Printing\nHouse Square yet.  We must keep our own course without faltering.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Charles, most undoubtedly,\" assented the Prime Minister,\nwith his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"It was so kind of you to call.  I am all impatience to know what was\ndone in the Council.\"\n\n\"Pure formalities, nothing more.  By-the-way, the Macedonian prisoners\nare all right.\"\n\n\"Thank Goodness for that!\"\n\n\"We adjourned all other business until we should have you with us next\nweek.  The question of a dissolution begins to press.  The reports from\nthe provinces are excellent.\"\n\nThe Foreign Minister moved impatiently and groaned.\n\n\"We must really straighten up our foreign business a little,\" said he.\n\"I must get Novikoff's Note answered.  It is clever, but the fallacies\nare obvious.  I wish, too, we could clear up the Afghan frontier.  This\nillness is most exasperating.  There is so much to be done, but my\nbrain is clouded.  Sometimes I think it is the gout, and sometimes I\nput it down to the colchicum.\"\n\n\"What will our medical autocrat say?\" laughed the Prime Minister.  \"You\nare so irreverent, Charles.  With a bishop one may feel at one's ease.\nThey are not beyond the reach of argument.  But a doctor with his\nstethoscope and thermometer is a thing apart.  Your reading does not\nimpinge upon him.  He is serenely above you.  And then, of course, he\ntakes you at a disadvantage.  With health and strength one might cope\nwith him.  Have you read Hahnemann?  What are your views upon\nHahnemann?\"\n\nThe invalid knew his illustrious colleague too well to follow him down\nany of those by-paths of knowledge in which he delighted to wander.  To\nhis intensely shrewd and practical mind there was something repellent\nin the waste of energy involved in a discussion upon the Early Church\nor the twenty-seven principles of Mesmer.  It was his custom to slip\npast such conversational openings with a quick step and an averted face.\n\n\"I have hardly glanced at his writings,\" said he.  \"By-the-way, I\nsuppose that there was no special departmental news?\"\n\n\"Ah!  I had almost forgotten.  Yes, it was one of the things which I\nhad called to tell you.  Sir Algernon Jones has resigned at Tangier.\nThere is a vacancy there.\"\n\n\"It had better be filled at once.  The longer delay the more\napplicants.\"\n\n\"Ah, patronage, patronage!\" sighed the Prime Minister.  \"Every vacancy\nmakes one doubtful friend and a dozen very positive enemies.  Who so\nbitter as the disappointed place-seeker?  But you are right, Charles.\nBetter fill it at once, especially as there is some little trouble in\nMorocco.  I understand that the Duke of Tavistock would like the place\nfor his fourth son, Lord Arthur Sibthorpe.  We are under some\nobligation to the Duke.\"\n\nThe Foreign Minister sat up eagerly.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" he said, \"it is the very appointment which I should\nhave suggested.  Lord Arthur would be very much better in Tangier at\npresent than in--in----\"\n\n\"Cavendish Square?\" hazarded his chief, with a little arch query of his\neyebrows.\n\n\"Well, let us say London.  He has manner and tact.  He was at\nConstantinople in Norton's time.\"\n\n\"Then he talks Arabic?\"\n\n\"A smattering.  But his French is good.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Arabic, Charles, have you dipped into Averroes?\"\n\n\"No, I have not.  But the appointment would be an excellent one in\nevery way.  Would you have the great goodness to arrange the matter in\nmy absence?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Charles, certainly.  Is there anything else that I can do?\"\n\n\"No.  I hope to be in the House by Monday.\"\n\n\"I trust so.  We miss you at every turn.  The Times will try to make\nmischief over that Grecian business.  A leader-writer is a terribly\nirresponsible thing, Charles.  There is no method by which he may be\nconfuted, however preposterous his assertions.  Good-bye!  Read Porson!\nGoodbye!\"\n\nHe shook the invalid's hand, gave a jaunty wave of his broad-brimmed\nhat, and darted out of the room with the same elasticity and energy\nwith which he had entered it.\n\nThe footman had already opened the great folding door to usher the\nillustrious visitor to his carriage, when a lady stepped from the\ndrawing-room and touched him on the sleeve.  From behind the\nhalf-closed portiere of stamped velvet a little pale face peeped out,\nhalf-curious, half-frightened.\n\n\"May I have one word?\"\n\n\"Surely, Lady Clara.\"\n\n\"I hope it is not intrusive.  I would not for the world overstep the\nlimits----\"\n\n\"My dear Lady Clara!\" interrupted the Prime Minister, with a youthful\nbow and wave.\n\n\"Pray do not answer me if I go too far.  But I know that Lord Arthur\nSibthorpe has applied for Tangier.  Would it be a liberty if I asked\nyou what chance he has?\"\n\n\"The post is filled up.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nIn the foreground and background there was a disappointed face.\n\n\"And Lord Arthur has it.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister chuckled over his little piece of roguery.\n\n\"We have just decided it,\" he continued.\n\n\"Lord Arthur must go in a week.  I am delighted to perceive, Lady\nClara, that the appointment has your approval.  Tangier is a place of\nextraordinary interest.  Catherine of Braganza and Colonel Kirke will\noccur to your memory.  Burton has written well upon Northern Africa.  I\ndine at Windsor, so I am sure that you will excuse my leaving you.  I\ntrust that Lord Charles will be better.  He can hardly fail to be so\nwith such a nurse.\"\n\nHe bowed, waved, and was off down the steps to his brougham.  As he\ndrove away, Lady Clara could see that he was already deeply absorbed in\na paper-covered novel.\n\nShe pushed back the velvet curtains, and returned into the\ndrawing-room.  Her daughter stood in the sunlight by the window, tall,\nfragile, and exquisite, her features and outline not unlike her\nmother's, but frailer, softer, more delicate.  The golden light struck\none half of her high-bred, sensitive face, and glimmered upon her\nthickly-coiled flaxen hair, striking a pinkish tint from her\nclosely-cut costume of fawn-coloured cloth with its dainty cinnamon\nruchings.  One little soft frill of chiffon nestled round her throat,\nfrom which the white, graceful neck and well-poised head shot up like a\nlily amid moss.  Her thin white hands were pressed together, and her\nblue eyes turned beseechingly upon her mother.\n\n\"Silly girl!  Silly girl!\" said the matron, answering that imploring\nlook.  She put her hands upon her daughter's sloping shoulders and drew\nher towards her.  \"It is a very nice place for a short time.  It will\nbe a stepping stone.\"\n\n\"But oh! mamma, in a week!  Poor Arthur!\"\n\n\"He will be happy.\"\n\n\"What! happy to part?\"\n\n\"He need not part.  You shall go with him.\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma!\"\n\n\"Yes, I say it.\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma, in a week?\"\n\n\"Yes indeed.  A great deal may be done in a week.  I shall order your\ntrousseau to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh! you dear, sweet angel!  But I am so frightened!  And papa?  Oh!\ndear, I am so frightened!\"\n\n\"Your papa is a diplomatist, dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma.\"\n\n\"But, between ourselves, he married a diplomatist too.  If he can\nmanage the British Empire, I think that I can manage him, Ida.  How\nlong have you been engaged, child?\"\n\n\"Ten weeks, mamma.\"\n\n\"Then it is quite time it came to a head.  Lord Arthur cannot leave\nEngland without you.  You must go to Tangier as the Minister's wife.\nNow, you will sit there on the settee, dear, and let me manage\nentirely.  There is Sir William's carriage!  I do think that I know how\nto manage Sir William.  James, just ask the doctor to step in this way!\"\n\nA heavy, two-horsed carriage had drawn up at the door, and there came a\nsingle stately thud upon the knocker.  An instant afterwards the\ndrawing-room door flew open and the footman ushered in the famous\nphysician.  He was a small man, clean-shaven, with the old-fashioned\nblack dress and white cravat with high-standing collar.  He swung his\ngolden pince-nez in his right hand as he walked, and bent forward with\na peering, blinking expression, which was somehow suggestive of the\ndark and complex cases through which he had seen.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, as he entered.  \"My young patient!  I am glad of the\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"Yes, I wish to speak to you about her, Sir William.  Pray take this\narm-chair.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will sit beside her,\" said he, taking his place upon the\nsettee.  \"She is looking better, less anaemic unquestionably, and a\nfuller pulse.  Quite a little tinge of colour, and yet not hectic.\"\n\n\"I feel stronger, Sir William.\"\n\n\"But she still has the pain in the side.\"\n\n\"Ah, that pain!\"  He tapped lightly under the collar-bones, and then\nbent forward with his biaural stethoscope in either ear.  \"Still a\ntrace of dulness--still a slight crepitation,\" he murmured.\n\n\"You spoke of a change, doctor.\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly a judicious change might be advisable.\"\n\n\"You said a dry climate.  I wish to do to the letter what you\nrecommend.\"\n\n\"You have always been model patients.\"\n\n\"We wish to be.  You said a dry climate.\"\n\n\"Did I?  I rather forget the particulars of our conversation.  But a\ndry climate is certainly indicated.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"Well, I think really that a patient should be allowed some latitude.\nI must not exact too rigid discipline.  There is room for individual\nchoice--the Engadine, Central Europe, Egypt, Algiers, which you like.\"\n\n\"I hear that Tangier is also recommended.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, certainly; it is very dry.\"\n\n\"You hear, Ida? Sir William says that you are to go to Tangier.\"\n\n\"Or any----\"\n\n\"No, no, Sir William!  We feel safest when we are most obedient.  You\nhave said Tangier, and we shall certainly try Tangier.\"\n\n\"Really, Lady Clara, your implicit faith is most flattering.  It is not\neveryone who would sacrifice their own plans and inclinations so\nreadily.\"\n\n\"We know your skill and your experience, Sir William.  Ida shall try\nTangier.  I am convinced that she will be benefited.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\n\n\"But you know Lord Charles.  He is just a little inclined to decide\nmedical matters as he would an affair of State.  I hope that you will\nbe firm with him.\"\n\n\"As long as Lord Charles honours me so far as to ask my advice I am\nsure that he would not place me in the false position of having that\nadvice disregarded.\"\n\nThe medical baronet whirled round the cord of his pince-nez and pushed\nout a protesting hand.\n\n\"No, no, but you must be firm on the point of Tangier.\"\n\n\"Having deliberately formed the opinion that Tangier is the best place\nfor our young patient, I do not think that I shall readily change my\nconviction.\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"I shall speak to Lord Charles upon the subject now when I go upstairs.\"\n\n\"Pray do.\"\n\n\"And meanwhile she will continue her present course of treatment.  I\ntrust that the warm African air may send her back in a few months with\nall her energy restored.\"\n\nHe bowed in the courteous, sweeping, old-world fashion which had done\nso much to build up his ten thousand a year, and, with the stealthy\ngait of a man whose life is spent in sick-rooms, he followed the\nfootman upstairs.\n\nAs the red velvet curtains swept back into position, the Lady Ida threw\nher arms round her mother's neck and sank her face on to her bosom.\n\n\"Oh! mamma, you ARE a diplomatist!\" she cried.\n\nBut her mother's expression was rather that of the general who looked\nupon the first smoke of the guns than of one who had won the victory.\n\n\"All will be right, dear,\" said she, glancing down at the fluffy yellow\ncurls and tiny ear.  \"There is still much to be done, but I think we\nmay venture to order the trousseau.\"\n\n\"Oh I how brave you are!\"\n\n\"Of course, it will in any case be a very quiet affair.  Arthur must\nget the license.  I do not approve of hole-and-corner marriages, but\nwhere the gentleman has to take up an official position some allowance\nmust be made.  We can have Lady Hilda Edgecombe, and the Trevors, and\nthe Grevilles, and I am sure that the Prime Minister would run down if\nhe could.\"\n\n\"And papa?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he will come too, if he is well enough.  We must wait until\nSir William goes, and, meanwhile, I shall write to Lord Arthur.\"\n\nHalf an hour had passed, and quite a number of notes had been dashed\noff in the fine, bold, park-paling handwriting of the Lady Clara, when\nthe door clashed, and the wheels of the doctor's carriage were heard\ngrating outside against the kerb.  The Lady Clara laid down her pen,\nkissed her daughter, and started off for the sick-room.  The Foreign\nMinister was lying back in his chair, with a red silk handkerchief over\nhis forehead, and his bulbous, cotton-wadded foot still protruding upon\nits rest.\n\n\"I think it is almost liniment time,\" said Lady Clara, shaking a blue\ncrinkled bottle.  \"Shall I put on a little?\"\n\n\"Oh! this pestilent toe!\" groaned the sufferer.  \"Sir William won't\nhear of my moving yet.  I do think he is the most completely obstinate\nand pig-headed man that I have ever met.  I tell him that he has\nmistaken his profession, and that I could find him a post at\nConstantinople.  We need a mule out there.\"\n\n\"Poor Sir William!\" laughed Lady Clara.  \"But how has he roused your\nwrath?\"\n\n\"He is so persistent-so dogmatic.\"\n\n\"Upon what point?\"\n\n\"Well, he has been laying down the law about Ida.  He has decreed, it\nseems, that she is to go to Tangier.\"\n\n\"He said something to that effect before he went up to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, he did, did he?\"\n\nThe slow-moving, inscrutable eye came sliding round to her.\n\nLady Clara's face had assumed an expression of transparent obvious\ninnocence, an intrusive candour which is never seen in nature save when\na woman is bent upon deception.\n\n\"He examined her lungs, Charles.  He did not say much, but his\nexpression was very grave.\"\n\n\"Not to say owlish,\" interrupted the Minister.\n\n\"No, no, Charles; it is no laughing matter.  He said that she must have\na change.  I am sure that he thought more than he said.  He spoke of\ndulness and crepitation, and the effects of the African air.  Then the\ntalk turned upon dry, bracing health resorts, and he agreed that\nTangier was the place.  He said that even a few months there would work\na change.\"\n\n\"And that was all?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was all.\"\n\nLord Charles shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who is but\nhalf convinced.\n\n\"But of course,\" said Lady Clara, serenely, \"if you think it better\nthat Ida should not go she shall not.  The only thing is that if she\nshould get worse we might feel a little uncomfortable afterwards.  In a\nweakness of that sort a very short time may make a difference.  Sir\nWilliam evidently thought the matter critical.  Still, there is no\nreason why he should influence you.  It is a little responsibility,\nhowever.  If you take it all upon yourself and free me from any of it,\nso that afterwards----\"\n\n\"My dear Clara, how you do croak!\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't wish to do that, Charles.  But you remember what happened\nto Lord Bellamy's child.  She was just Ida's age.  That was another\ncase in which Sir William's advice was disregarded.\"\n\nLord Charles groaned impatiently.\n\n\"I have not disregarded it,\" said he.\n\n\"No, no, of course not.  I know your strong sense, and your good heart\ntoo well, dear.  You were very wisely looking at both sides of the\nquestion.  That is what we poor women cannot do.  It is emotion against\nreason, as I have often heard you say.  We are swayed this way and\nthat, but you men are persistent, and so you gain your way with us.\nBut I am so pleased that you have decided for Tangier.\"\n\n\"Have I?\"\n\n\"Well, dear, you said that you would not disregard Sir William.\"\n\n\"Well, Clara, admitting that Ida is to go to Tangier, you will allow\nthat it is impossible for me to escort her?\n\n\"Utterly.\"\n\n\"And for you?\n\n\"While you are ill my place is by your side.\"\n\n\"There is your sister?\"\n\n\"She is going to Florida.\"\n\n\"Lady Dumbarton, then?\"\n\n\"She is nursing her father.  It is out of the question.\"\n\n\"Well, then, whom can we possibly ask?  Especially just as the season\nis commencing.  You see, Clara, the fates fight against Sir William.\"\n\nHis wife rested her elbows against the back of the great red chair, and\npassed her fingers through the statesman's grizzled curls, stooping\ndown as she did so until her lips were close to his ear.\n\n\"There is Lord Arthur Sibthorpe,\" said she softly.\n\nLord Charles bounded in his chair, and muttered a word or two such as\nwere more frequently heard from Cabinet Ministers in Lord Melbourne's\ntime than now.\n\n\"Are you mad, Clara!\" he cried.  \"What can have put such a thought into\nyour head?\"\n\n\"The Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"Who?  The Prime Minister?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.  Now do, do be good!  Or perhaps I had better not speak to\nyou about it any more.\"\n\n\"Well, I really think that you have gone rather too far to retreat.\"\n\n\"It was the Prime Minister, then, who told me that Lord Arthur was\ngoing to Tangier.\"\n\n\"It is a fact, though it had escaped my memory for the instant.\"\n\n\"And then came Sir William with his advice about Ida.  Oh! Charlie, it\nis surely more than a coincidence!\"\n\n\"I am convinced,\" said Lord Charles, with his shrewd, questioning gaze,\n\"that it is very much more than a coincidence, Lady Clara.  You are a\nvery clever woman, my dear.  A born manager and organiser.\"\n\nLady Clara brushed past the compliment.\n\n\"Think of our own young days, Charlie,\" she whispered, with her fingers\nstill toying with his hair.  \"What were you then?  A poor man, not even\nAmbassador at Tangier.  But I loved you, and believed in you, and have\nI ever regretted it?  Ida loves and believes in Lord Arthur, and why\nshould she ever regret it either?\"\n\nLord Charles was silent.  His eyes were fixed upon the green branches\nwhich waved outside the window; but his mind had flashed back to a\nDevonshire country-house of thirty years ago, and to the one fateful\nevening when, between old yew hedges, he paced along beside a slender\ngirl, and poured out to her his hopes, his fears, and his ambitious.\nHe took the white, thin hand and pressed it to his lips.\n\n\"You, have been a good wife to me, Clara,\" said he.\n\nShe said nothing.  She did not attempt to improve upon her advantage.\nA less consummate general might have tried to do so, and ruined all.\nShe stood silent and submissive, noting the quick play of thought which\npeeped from his eyes and lip.  There was a sparkle in the one and a\ntwitch of amusement in the other, as he at last glanced up at her.\n\n\"Clara,\" said he, \"deny it if you can!  You have ordered the trousseau.\"\n\nShe gave his ear a little pinch.\n\n\"Subject to your approval,\" said she.\n\n\"You have written to the Archbishop.\"\n\n\"It is not posted yet.\"\n\n\"You have sent a note to Lord Arthur.\"\n\n\"How could you tell that?\"\n\n\"He is downstairs now.\"\n\n\"No; but I think that is his brougham.\"\n\nLord Charles sank back with a look of half-comical despair.\n\n\"Who is to fight against such a woman?\" he cried.  \"Oh! if I could send\nyou to Novikoff!  He is too much for any of my men.  But, Clara, I\ncannot have them up here.\"\n\n\"Not for your blessing?\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"It would make them so happy.\"\n\n\"I cannot stand scenes.\"\n\n\"Then I shall convey it to them.\"\n\n\"And pray say no more about it--to-day, at any rate.  I have been weak\nover the matter.\"\n\n\"Oh! Charlie, you who are so strong!\"\n\n\"You have outflanked me, Clara.  It was very well done.  I must\ncongratulate you.\"\n\n\"Well,\"  she murmured, as she kissed him, \"you know I have been\nstudying a very clever diplomatist for thirty years.\"\n\n\n\n\nA MEDICAL DOCUMENT.\n\nMedical men are, as a class, very much too busy to take stock of\nsingular situations or dramatic events.  Thus it happens that the\nablest chronicler of their experiences in our literature was a lawyer.\nA life spent in watching over death-beds--or over birth-beds which are\ninfinitely more trying--takes something from a man's sense of\nproportion, as constant strong waters might corrupt his palate.  The\noverstimulated nerve ceases to respond.  Ask the surgeon for his best\nexperiences and he may reply that he has seen little that is\nremarkable, or break away into the technical.  But catch him some night\nwhen the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking, with a few of his\nbrother practitioners for company and an artful question or allusion to\nset him going.  Then you will get some raw, green facts new plucked\nfrom the tree of life.\n\nIt is after one of the quarterly dinners of the Midland Branch of the\nBritish Medical Association.  Twenty coffee cups, a dozer liqueur\nglasses, and a solid bank of blue smoke which swirls slowly along the\nhigh, gilded ceiling gives a hint of a successful gathering.  But the\nmembers have shredded off to their homes.  The line of heavy,\nbulge-pocketed overcoats and of stethoscope-bearing top hats is gone\nfrom the hotel corridor.  Round the fire in the sitting-room three\nmedicos are still lingering, however, all smoking and arguing, while a\nfourth, who is a mere layman and young at that, sits back at the table.\nUnder cover of an open journal he is writing furiously with a\nstylographic pen, asking a question in an innocent voice from time to\ntime and so flickering up the conversation whenever it shows a tendency\nto wane.\n\nThe three men are all of that staid middle age which begins early and\nlasts late in the profession.  They are none of them famous, yet each\nis of good repute, and a fair type of his particular branch.  The\nportly man with the authoritative manner and the white, vitriol splash\nupon his cheek is Charley Manson, chief of the Wormley Asylum, and\nauthor of the brilliant monograph--Obscure Nervous Lesions in the\nUnmarried.  He always wears his collar high like that, since the\nhalf-successful attempt of a student of Revelations to cut his throat\nwith a splinter of glass.  The second, with the ruddy face and the\nmerry brown eyes, is a general practitioner, a man of vast experience,\nwho, with his three assistants and his five horses, takes twenty-five\nhundred a year in half-crown visits and shilling consultations out of\nthe poorest quarter of a great city.  That cheery face of Theodore\nFoster is seen at the side of a hundred sick-beds a day, and if he has\none-third more names on his visiting list than in his cash book he\nalways promises himself that he will get level some day when a\nmillionaire with a chronic complaint--the ideal combination--shall seek\nhis services.  The third, sitting on the right with his dress shoes\nshining on the top of the fender, is Hargrave, the rising surgeon.  His\nface has none of the broad humanity of Theodore Foster's, the eye is\nstern and critical, the mouth straight and severe, but there is\nstrength and decision in every line of it, and it is nerve rather than\nsympathy which the patient demands when he is bad enough to come to\nHargrave's door.  He calls himself a jawman \"a mere jawman\" as he\nmodestly puts it, but in point of fact he is too young and too poor to\nconfine himself to a specialty, and there is nothing surgical which\nHargrave has not the skill and the audacity to do.\n\n\"Before, after, and during,\" murmurs the general practitioner in answer\nto some interpolation of the outsider's.  \"I assure you, Manson, one\nsees all sorts of evanescent forms of madness.\"\n\n\"Ah, puerperal!\" throws in the other, knocking the curved grey ash from\nhis cigar.  \"But you had some case in your mind, Foster.\"\n\n\"Well, there was only one last week which was new to me.  I had been\nengaged by some people of the name of Silcoe.  When the trouble came\nround I went myself, for they would not hear of an assistant.  The\nhusband who was a policeman, was sitting at the head of the bed on the\nfurther side.  'This won't do,' said I.  'Oh yes, doctor, it must do,'\nsaid she.  'It's quite irregular and he must go,' said I.  'It's that\nor nothing,' said she.  'I won't open my mouth or stir a finger the\nwhole night,' said he.  So it ended by my allowing him to remain, and\nthere he sat for eight hours on end.  She was very good over the\nmatter, but every now and again HE would fetch a hollow groan, and I\nnoticed that he held his right hand just under the sheet all the time,\nwhere I had no doubt that it was clasped by her left.  When it was all\nhappily over, I looked at him and his face was the colour of this cigar\nash, and his head had dropped on to the edge of the pillow.  Of course\nI thought he had fainted with emotion, and I was just telling myself\nwhat I thought of myself for having been such a fool as to let him stay\nthere, when suddenly I saw that the sheet over his hand was all soaked\nwith blood; I whisked it down, and  there was the fellow's wrist half\ncut through.  The woman had one bracelet of a policeman's handcuff over\nher left wrist and the other round his right one.  When she had been in\npain she had twisted with all her strength and the iron had fairly\neaten into the bone of the man's arm.  'Aye, doctor,' said she, when\nshe saw I had noticed it.  'He's got to take his share as well as me.\nTurn and turn,' said she.\"\n\n\"Don't you find it a very wearing branch of the profession?\" asks\nFoster after a pause.\n\n\"My dear fellow, it was the fear of it that drove me into lunacy work.\"\n\n\"Aye, and it has driven men into asylums who never found their way on\nto the medical staff.  I was a very shy fellow myself as a student, and\nI know what it means.\"\n\n\"No joke that in general practice,\" says the alienist.\n\n\"Well, you hear men talk about it as though it were, but I tell you\nit's much nearer tragedy.  Take some poor, raw, young fellow who has\njust put up his plate in a strange town.  He has found it a trial all\nhis life, perhaps, to talk to a woman about lawn tennis and church\nservices.  When a young man IS shy he is shyer than any girl.  Then\ndown comes an anxious mother and consults him upon the most intimate\nfamily matters.  'I shall never go to that doctor again,' says she\nafterwards.  'His manner is so stiff and unsympathetic.' Unsympathetic!\nWhy, the poor lad was struck dumb and paralysed.  I have known general\npractitioners who were so shy that they could not bring themselves to\nask the way in the street.  Fancy what sensitive men like that must\nendure before they get broken in to medical practice.  And then they\nknow that nothing is so catching as shyness, and that if they do not\nkeep a face of stone, their patient will be covered with confusion.\nAnd so they keep their face of stone, and earn the reputation perhaps\nof having a heart to correspond.  I suppose nothing would shake YOUR\nnerve, Manson.\"\n\n\"Well, when a man lives year in year out among a thousand lunatics,\nwith a fair sprinkling of homicidals among them, one's nerves either\nget set or shattered.  Mine are all right so far.\"\n\n\"I was frightened once,\" says the surgeon.  \"It was when I was doing\ndispensary work.  One night I had a call from some very poor people,\nand gathered from the few words they said that their child was ill.\nWhen I entered the room I saw a small cradle in the corner.  Raising\nthe lamp I walked over and putting back the curtains I looked down at\nthe baby.  I tell you it was sheer Providence that I didn't drop that\nlamp and set the whole place alight.  The head on the pillow turned and\nI saw a face looking up at me which seemed to me to have more\nmalignancy and wickedness than ever I had dreamed of in a nightmare.\nIt was the flush of red over the cheekbones, and the brooding eyes full\nof loathing of me, and of everything else, that impressed me.  I'll\nnever forget my start as, instead of the chubby face of an infant, my\neyes fell upon this creature.  I took the mother into the next room.\n'What is it?' I asked.  'A girl of sixteen,' said she, and then\nthrowing up her arms, 'Oh, pray God she may be taken!'  The poor thing,\nthough she spent her life in this little cradle, had great, long, thin\nlimbs which she curled up under her.  I lost sight of the case and\ndon't know what became of it, but I'll never forget the look in her\neyes.\"\n\n\"That's creepy,\" says Dr. Foster.  \"But I think one of my experiences\nwould run it close.  Shortly after I put up my plate I had a visit from\na little hunch-backed woman who wished me to come and attend to her\nsister in her trouble.  When I reached the house, which was a very poor\none, I found two other little hunched-backed women, exactly like the\nfirst, waiting for me in the sitting-room.  Not one of them said a\nword, but my companion took the lamp and walked upstairs with her two\nsisters behind her, and me bringing up the rear.  I can see those three\nqueer shadows cast by the lamp upon the wall as clearly as I can see\nthat tobacco pouch.  In the room above was the fourth sister, a\nremarkably beautiful girl in evident need of my assistance.  There was\nno wedding ring upon her finger.  The three deformed sisters seated\nthemselves round the room, like so many graven images, and all night\nnot one of them opened her mouth.  I'm not romancing, Hargrave; this is\nabsolute fact.  In the early morning a fearful thunderstorm broke out,\none of the most violent I have ever known.  The little garret burned\nblue with the lightning, and thunder roared and rattled as if it were\non the very roof of the house.  It wasn't much of a lamp I had, and it\nwas a queer thing when a spurt of lightning came to see those three\ntwisted figures sitting round the walls, or to have the voice of my\npatient drowned by the booming of the thunder.  By Jove!  I don't mind\ntelling you that there was a time when I nearly bolted from the room.\nAll came right in the end, but I never heard the true story of the\nunfortunate beauty and her three crippled sisters.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of these medical stories,\" sighs the outsider.  \"They\nnever seem to have an end.\"\n\n\"When a man is up to his neck in practice, my boy, he has no time to\ngratify his private curiosity.  Things shoot across him and he gets a\nglimpse of them, only to recall them, perhaps, at some quiet moment\nlike this.  But I've always felt, Manson, that your line had as much of\nthe terrible in it as any other.\"\n\n\"More,\" groans the alienist.  \"A disease of the body is bad enough, but\nthis seems to be a disease of the soul.  Is it not a shocking thing--a\nthing to drive a reasoning man into absolute Materialism--to think that\nyou may have a fine, noble fellow with every divine instinct and that\nsome little vascular change, the dropping, we will say, of a minute\nspicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of\nhis brain may have the effect of changing him to a filthy and pitiable\ncreature with every low and debasing tendency?  What a satire an asylum\nis upon the majesty of man, and no less upon the ethereal nature of the\nsoul.\"\n\n\"Faith and hope,\" murmurs the general practitioner.\n\n\"I have no faith, not much hope, and all the charity I can afford,\"\nsays the surgeon.  \"When theology squares itself with the facts of life\nI'll read it up.\"\n\n\"You were talking about cases,\" says the outsider, jerking the ink down\ninto his stylographic pen.\n\n\"Well, take a common complaint which kills many thousands every year,\nlike G. P. for instance.\"\n\n\"What's G. P.?\"\n\n\"General practitioner,\" suggests the surgeon with a grin.\n\n\"The British public will have to know what G. P.  is,\" says the\nalienist gravely.  \"It's increasing by leaps and bounds, and it has the\ndistinction of being absolutely incurable.  General paralysis is its\nfull title, and I tell you it promises to be a perfect scourge.  Here's\na fairly typical case now which I saw last Monday week.  A young\nfarmer, a splendid fellow, surprised his fellows by taking a very rosy\nview of things at a time when the whole country-side was grumbling.  He\nwas going to give up wheat, give up arable land, too, if it didn't pay,\nplant two thousand acres of rhododendrons and get a monopoly of the\nsupply for Covent Garden--there was no end to his schemes, all sane\nenough but just a bit inflated.  I called at the farm, not to see him,\nbut on an altogether different matter.  Something about the man's way\nof talking struck me and I watched him narrowly.  His lip had a trick\nof quivering, his words slurred themselves together, and so did his\nhandwriting when he had occasion to draw up a small agreement.  A\ncloser inspection showed me that one of his pupils was ever so little\nlarger than the other.  As I left the house his wife came after me.\n'Isn't it splendid to see Job looking so well, doctor,' said she; 'he's\nthat full of energy he can hardly keep himself quiet.'  I did not say\nanything, for I had not the heart, but I knew that the fellow was as\nmuch condemned to death as though he were lying in the cell at Newgate.\nIt was a characteristic case of incipient G. P.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cries the outsider.  \"My own lips tremble.  I often\nslur my words.  I believe I've got it myself.\"\n\nThree little chuckles come from the front of the fire.\n\n\"There's the danger of a little medical knowledge to the layman.\"\n\n\"A great authority has said that every first year's student is\nsuffering in silent agony from four diseases,\" remarks the surgeon.\n\"One is heart disease, of course; another is cancer of the parotid.  I\nforget the two other.\"\n\n\"Where does the parotid come in?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's the last wisdom tooth coming through!\"\n\n\"And what would be the end of that young farmer?\" asks the outsider.\n\n\"Paresis of all the muscles, ending in fits, coma, and death.  It may\nbe a few months, it may be a year or two.  He was a very strong young\nman and would take some killing.\"\n\n\"By-the-way,\" says the alienist, \"did I ever tell you about the first\ncertificate I signed?  I came as near ruin then as a man could go.\"\n\n\"What was it, then?\"\n\n\"I was in practice at the time.  One morning a Mrs. Cooper called upon\nme and informed me that her husband had shown signs of delusions\nlately.  They took the form of imagining that he had been in the army\nand had distinguished himself very much.  As a matter of fact he was a\nlawyer and had never been out of England.  Mrs. Cooper was of opinion\nthat if I were to call it might alarm him, so it was agreed between us\nthat she should send him up in the evening on some pretext to my\nconsulting-room, which would give me the opportunity of having a chat\nwith him and, if I were convinced of his insanity, of signing his\ncertificate.  Another doctor had already signed, so that it only needed\nmy concurrence to have him placed under treatment.  Well, Mr. Cooper\narrived in the evening about half an hour before I had expected him,\nand consulted me as to some malarious symptoms from which he said that\nhe suffered.  According to his account he had just returned from the\nAbyssinian Campaign, and had been one of the first of the British\nforces to enter Magdala.  No delusion could possibly be more marked,\nfor he would talk of little else, so I filled in the papers without the\nslightest hesitation.  When his wife arrived, after he had left, I put\nsome questions to her to complete the form.  'What is his age?' I\nasked.  'Fifty,' said she.  'Fifty!' I cried.  'Why, the man I examined\ncould not have been more than thirty!  And so it came out that the real\nMr. Cooper had never called upon me at all, but that by one of those\ncoincidences which take a man's breath away another Cooper, who really\nwas a very distinguished young officer of artillery, had come in to\nconsult me.  My pen was wet to sign the paper when I discovered it,\"\nsays Dr. Manson, mopping his forehead.\n\n\"We were talking about nerve just now,\" observes the surgeon.  \"Just\nafter my qualifying I served in the Navy for a time, as I think you\nknow.  I was on the flag-ship on the West African Station, and I\nremember a singular example of nerve which came to my notice at that\ntime.  One of our small gunboats had gone up the Calabar river, and\nwhile there the surgeon died of coast fever.  On the same day a man's\nleg was broken by a spar falling upon it, and it became quite obvious\nthat it must be taken off above the knee if his life was to be saved.\nThe young lieutenant who was in charge of the craft searched among the\ndead doctor's effects and laid his hands upon some chloroform, a\nhip-joint knife, and a volume of Grey's Anatomy.  He had the man laid\nby the steward upon the cabin table, and with a picture of a cross\nsection of the thigh in front of him he began to take off the limb.\nEvery now and then, referring to the diagram, he would say:  'Stand by\nwith the lashings, steward.  There's blood on the chart about here.'\nThen he would jab with his knife until he cut the artery, and he and\nhis assistant would tie it up before they went any further.  In this\nway they gradually whittled the leg off, and upon my word they made a\nvery excellent job of it.  The man is hopping about the Portsmouth Hard\nat this day.\n\n\"It's no joke when the doctor of one of these isolated gunboats himself\nfalls ill,\" continues the surgeon after a pause.  \"You might think it\neasy for him to prescribe for himself, but this fever knocks you down\nlike a club, and you haven't strength left to brush a mosquito off your\nface.  I had a touch of it at Lagos, and I know what I am telling you.\nBut there was a chum of mine who really had a curious experience.  The\nwhole crew gave him up, and, as they had never had a funeral aboard the\nship, they began rehearsing the forms so as to be ready.  They thought\nthat he was unconscious, but he swears he could hear every word that\npassed.  'Corpse comin' up the latchway!' cried the Cockney sergeant of\nMarines.  'Present harms!'  He was so amused, and so indignant too,\nthat he just made up his mind that he wouldn't be carried through that\nhatchway, and he wasn't, either.\"\n\n\"There's no need for fiction in medicine,\" remarks Foster, \"for the\nfacts will always beat anything you can fancy.  But it has seemed to me\nsometimes that a curious paper might be read at some of these meetings\nabout the uses of medicine in popular fiction.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well, of what the folk die of, and what diseases are made most use of\nin novels.  Some are worn to pieces, and others, which are equally\ncommon in real life, are never mentioned.  Typhoid is fairly frequent,\nbut scarlet fever is unknown.  Heart disease is common, but then heart\ndisease, as we know it, is usually the sequel of some foregoing\ndisease, of which we never hear anything in the romance.  Then there is\nthe mysterious malady called brain fever, which always attacks the\nheroine after a crisis, but which is unknown under that name to the\ntext books.  People when they are over-excited in novels fall down in a\nfit.  In a fairly large experience I have never known anyone do so in\nreal life.  The small complaints simply don't exist.  Nobody ever gets\nshingles or quinsy, or mumps in a novel.  All the diseases, too, belong\nto the upper part of the body.  The novelist never strikes below the\nbelt.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Foster,\" says the alienist, \"there is a side of\nlife which is too medical for the general public and too romantic for\nthe professional journals, but which contains some of the richest human\nmaterials that a man could study.  It's not a pleasant side, I am\nafraid, but if it is good enough for Providence to create, it is good\nenough for us to try and understand.  It would deal with strange\noutbursts of savagery and vice in the lives of the best men, curious\nmomentary weaknesses in the record of the sweetest women, known but to\none or two, and inconceivable to the world around.  It would deal, too,\nwith the singular phenomena of waxing and of waning manhood, and would\nthrow a light upon those actions which have cut short many an honoured\ncareer and sent a man to a prison when he should have been hurried to a\nconsulting-room.  Of all evils that may come upon the sons of men, God\nshield us principally from that one!\"\n\n\"I had a case some little time ago which was out of the ordinary,\" says\nthe surgeon.  \"There's a famous beauty in London society--I mention no\nnames--who used to be remarkable a few seasons ago for the very low\ndresses which she would wear.  She had the whitest of skins and most\nbeautiful of shoulders, so it was no wonder.  Then gradually the\nfrilling at her neck lapped upwards and upwards, until last year she\nastonished everyone by wearing quite a high collar at a time when it\nwas completely out of fashion.  Well, one day this very woman was shown\ninto my consulting-room.  When the footman was gone she suddenly tore\noff the upper part of her dress.  'For Gods sake do something for me!'\nshe cried.  Then I saw what the trouble was.  A rodent ulcer was eating\nits way upwards, coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of\nit was flush with her collar.  The red streak of its trail was lost\nbelow the line of her bust.  Year by year it had ascended and she had\nheightened her dress to hide it, until now it was about to invade her\nface.  She had been too proud to confess her trouble, even to a medical\nman.\"\n\n\"And did you stop it?\"\n\n\"Well, with zinc chloride I did what I could.  But it may break out\nagain.  She was one of those beautiful white-and-pink creatures who are\nrotten with struma.  You may patch but you can't mend.\"\n\n\"Dear! dear! dear!\" cries the general practitioner, with that kindly\nsoftening of the eyes which had endeared him to so many thousands.  \"I\nsuppose we mustn't think ourselves wiser than Providence, but there are\ntimes when one feels that something is wrong in the scheme of things.\nI've seen some sad things in my life.  Did I ever tell you that case\nwhere Nature divorced a most loving couple?  He was a fine young\nfellow, an athlete and a gentleman, but he overdid athletics.  You know\nhow the force that controls us gives us a little tweak to remind us\nwhen we get off the beaten track.  It may be a pinch on the great toe\nif we drink too much and work too little.  Or it may be a tug on our\nnerves if we dissipate energy too much.  With the athlete, of course,\nit's the heart or the lungs.  He had bad phthisis and was sent to\nDavos.  Well, as luck would have it, she developed rheumatic fever,\nwhich left her heart very much affected.  Now, do you see the dreadful\ndilemma in which those poor people found themselves?  When he came\nbelow four thousand feet or so, his symptoms became terrible.  She\ncould come up about twenty-five hundred and then her heart reached its\nlimit.  They had several interviews half way down the valley, which\nleft them nearly dead, and at last, the doctors had to absolutely\nforbid it.  And so for four years they lived within three miles of each\nother and never met.  Every morning he would go to a place which\noverlooked the chalet in which she lived and would wave a great white\ncloth and she answer from below.  They could see each other quite\nplainly with their field glasses, and they might have been in different\nplanets for all their chance of meeting.\"\n\n\"And one at last died,\" says the outsider.\n\n\"No, sir.  I'm sorry not to be able to clinch the story, but the man\nrecovered and is now a successful stockbroker in Drapers Gardens.  The\nwoman, too, is the mother of a considerable family.  But what are you\ndoing there?\"\n\n\"Only taking a note or two of your talk.\"\n\nThe three medical men laugh as they walk towards their overcoats.\n\n\"Why, we've done nothing but talk shop,\" says the general practitioner.\n\"What possible interest can the public take in that?\"\n\n\n\n\nLOT NO. 249.\n\nOf the dealings of Edward Bellingham with William Monkhouse Lee, and of\nthe cause of the great terror of Abercrombie Smith, it may be that no\nabsolute and final judgment will ever be delivered.  It is true that we\nhave the full and clear narrative of Smith himself, and such\ncorroboration as he could look for from Thomas Styles the servant, from\nthe Reverend Plumptree Peterson, Fellow of Old's, and from such other\npeople as chanced to gain some passing glance at this or that incident\nin a singular chain of events.  Yet, in the main, the story must rest\nupon Smith alone, and the most will think that it is more likely that\none brain, however outwardly sane, has some subtle warp in its texture,\nsome strange flaw in its workings, than that the path of Nature has\nbeen overstepped in open day in so famed a centre of learning and light\nas the University of Oxford.  Yet when we think how narrow and how\ndevious this path of Nature is, how dimly we can trace it, for all our\nlamps of science, and how from the darkness which girds it round great\nand terrible possibilities loom ever shadowly upwards, it is a bold and\nconfident man who will put a limit to the strange by-paths into which\nthe human spirit may wander.\n\nIn a certain wing of what we will call Old College in Oxford there is a\ncorner turret of an exceeding great age.  The heavy arch which spans\nthe open door has bent downwards in the centre under the weight of its\nyears, and the grey, lichen-blotched blocks of stone are, bound and\nknitted together with withes and strands of ivy, as though the old\nmother had set herself to brace them up against wind and weather.  From\nthe door a stone stair curves upward spirally, passing two landings,\nand terminating in a third one, its steps all shapeless and hollowed by\nthe tread of so many generations of the seekers after knowledge.  Life\nhas flowed like water down this winding stair, and, waterlike, has left\nthese smooth-worn grooves behind it.  From the long-gowned, pedantic\nscholars of Plantagenet days down to the young bloods of a later age,\nhow full and strong had been that tide of young English life.  And what\nwas left now of all those hopes, those strivings, those fiery energies,\nsave here and there in some old-world churchyard a few scratches upon a\nstone, and perchance a handful of dust in a mouldering coffin?  Yet\nhere were the silent stair and the grey old wall, with bend and saltire\nand many another heraldic device still to be read upon its surface,\nlike grotesque shadows thrown back from the days that had passed.\n\nIn the month of May, in the year 1884, three young men occupied the\nsets of rooms which opened on to the separate landings of the old\nstair.  Each set consisted simply of a sitting-room and of a bedroom,\nwhile the two corresponding rooms upon the ground-floor were used, the\none as a coal-cellar, and the other as the living-room of the servant,\nor gyp, Thomas Styles, whose duty it was to wait upon the three men\nabove him.  To right and to left was a line of lecture-rooms and of\noffices, so that the dwellers in the old turret enjoyed a certain\nseclusion, which made the chambers popular among the more studious\nundergraduates.  Such were the three who occupied them now--Abercrombie\nSmith above, Edward Bellingham beneath him, and William Monkhouse Lee\nupon the lowest storey.\n\nIt was ten o'clock on a bright spring night, and Abercrombie Smith lay\nback in his arm-chair, his feet upon the fender, and his briar-root\npipe between his lips.  In a similar chair, and equally at his ease,\nthere lounged on the other side of the fireplace his old school friend\nJephro Hastie.  Both men were in flannels, for they had spent their\nevening upon the river, but apart from their dress no one could look at\ntheir hard-cut, alert faces without seeing that they were open-air\nmen--men whose minds and tastes turned naturally to all that was manly\nand robust.  Hastie, indeed, was stroke of his college boat, and Smith\nwas an even better oar, but a coming examination had already cast its\nshadow over him and held him to his work, save for the few hours a week\nwhich health demanded.  A litter of medical books upon the table, with\nscattered bones, models and anatomical plates, pointed to the extent as\nwell as the nature of his studies, while a couple of single-sticks and\na set of boxing-gloves above the mantelpiece hinted at the means by\nwhich, with Hastie's help, he might take his exercise in its most\ncompressed and least distant form.  They knew each other very well--so\nwell that they could sit now in that soothing silence which is the very\nhighest development of companionship.\n\n\"Have some whisky,\" said Abercrombie Smith at last between two\ncloudbursts.  \"Scotch in the jug and Irish in the bottle.\"\n\n\"No, thanks.  I'm in for the sculls.  I don't liquor when I'm training.\nHow about you?\"\n\n\"I'm reading hard.  I think it best to leave it alone.\"\n\nHastie nodded, and they relapsed into a contented silence.\n\n\"By-the-way, Smith,\" asked Hastie, presently, \"have you made the\nacquaintance of either of the fellows on your stair yet?\"\n\n\"Just a nod when we pass.  Nothing more.\"\n\n\"Hum! I should be inclined to let it stand at that.  I know something\nof them both.  Not much, but as much as I want.  I don't think I should\ntake them to my bosom if I were you.  Not that there's much amiss with\nMonkhouse Lee.\"\n\n\"Meaning the thin one?\"\n\n\"Precisely.  He is a gentlemanly little fellow.  I don't think there is\nany vice in him.  But then you can't know him without knowing\nBellingham.\"\n\n\"Meaning the fat one?\"\n\n\"Yes, the fat one.  And he's a man whom I, for one, would rather not\nknow.\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith raised his eyebrows and glanced across at his\ncompanion.\n\n\"What's up, then?\" he asked.  \"Drink?  Cards?  Cad?  You used not to be\ncensorious.\"\n\n\"Ah! you evidently don't know the man, or you wouldn't ask.  There's\nsomething damnable about him--something reptilian.  My gorge always\nrises at him.  I should put him down as a man with secret vices--an\nevil liver.  He's no fool, though.  They say that he is one  of the\nbest men in his line that they have ever had in the college.\"\n\n\"Medicine or classics?\"\n\n\"Eastern languages.  He's a demon at them.  Chillingworth met him\nsomewhere above the second cataract last long, and he told me that he\njust prattled to the Arabs as if he had been born and nursed and weaned\namong them.  He talked Coptic to the Copts, and Hebrew to the Jews, and\nArabic to the Bedouins, and they were all ready to kiss the hem of his\nfrock-coat.  There are some old hermit Johnnies up in those parts who\nsit on rocks and scowl and spit at the casual stranger.  Well, when\nthey saw this chap Bellingham, before he had said five words they just\nlay down on their bellies and wriggled.  Chillingworth said that he\nnever saw anything like it.  Bellingham seemed to take it as his right,\ntoo, and strutted about among them and talked down to them like a Dutch\nuncle.  Pretty good for an undergrad. of Old's, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Why do you say you can't know Lee without knowing Bellingham?\"\n\n\"Because Bellingham is engaged to his sister Eveline.  Such a bright\nlittle girl, Smith!  I know the whole family well.  It's disgusting to\nsee that brute with her.  A toad and a dove, that's what they always\nremind me of.\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith grinned and knocked his ashes out against the side of\nthe grate.\n\n\"You show every card in your hand, old chap,\" said he.  \"What a\nprejudiced, green-eyed, evil-thinking old man it is!  You have really\nnothing against the fellow except that.\"\n\n\"Well, I've known her ever since she was as long as that cherry-wood\npipe, and I don't like to see her taking risks.  And it is a risk.  He\nlooks beastly.  And he has a beastly temper, a venomous temper.  You\nremember his row with Long Norton?\"\n\n\"No; you always forget that I am a freshman.\"\n\n\"Ah, it was last winter.  Of course.  Well, you know the towpath along\nby the river.  There were several fellows going along it, Bellingham in\nfront, when they came on an old market-woman coming the other way.  It\nhad been raining--you know what those fields are like when it has\nrained--and the path ran between the river and a great puddle that was\nnearly as broad.  Well, what does this swine do but keep the path, and\npush the old girl into the mud, where she and her marketings came to\nterrible grief.  It was a blackguard thing to do, and Long Norton, who\nis as gentle a fellow as ever stepped, told him what he thought of it.\nOne word led to another, and it ended in Norton laying his stick across\nthe fellow's shoulders.  There was the deuce of a fuss about it, and\nit's a treat to see the way in which Bellingham looks at Norton when\nthey meet now.  By Jove, Smith, it's nearly eleven o'clock!\"\n\n\"No hurry.  Light your pipe again.\"\n\n\"Not I.  I'm supposed to be in training.  Here I've been sitting\ngossiping when I ought to have been safely tucked up.  I'll borrow your\nskull, if you can share it.  Williams has had mine for a month.  I'll\ntake the little bones of your ear, too, if you are sure you won't need\nthem.  Thanks very much.  Never mind a bag, I can carry them very well\nunder my arm.  Good-night, my son, and take my tip as to your\nneighbour.\"\n\nWhen Hastie, bearing his anatomical plunder, had clattered off down the\nwinding stair, Abercrombie Smith hurled his pipe into the wastepaper\nbasket, and drawing his chair nearer to the lamp, plunged into a\nformidable green-covered volume, adorned with great colored maps of\nthat strange internal kingdom of which we are the hapless and helpless\nmonarchs.  Though a freshman at Oxford, the student was not so in\nmedicine, for he had worked for four years at Glasgow and at Berlin,\nand this coming examination would place him finally as a member of his\nprofession.  With his firm mouth, broad forehead, and clear-cut,\nsomewhat hard-featured face, he was a man who, if he had no brilliant\ntalent, was yet so dogged, so patient, and so strong that he might in\nthe end overtop a more showy genius.  A man who can hold his own among\nScotchmen and North Germans is not a man to be easily set back.  Smith\nhad left a name at Glasgow and at Berlin, and he was bent now upon\ndoing as much at Oxford, if hard work and devotion could accomplish it.\n\nHe had sat reading for about an hour, and the hands of the noisy\ncarriage clock upon the side table were rapidly closing together upon\nthe twelve, when a sudden sound fell upon the student's ear--a sharp,\nrather shrill sound, like the hissing intake of a man's breath who\ngasps under some strong emotion.  Smith laid down his book and slanted\nhis ear to listen.  There was no one on either side or above him, so\nthat the interruption came certainly from the neighbour beneath--the\nsame neighbour of whom Hastie had given so unsavoury an account.  Smith\nknew him only as a flabby, pale-faced man of silent and studious\nhabits, a man, whose lamp threw a golden bar from the old turret even\nafter he had extinguished his own.  This community in lateness had\nformed a certain silent bond between them.  It was soothing to Smith\nwhen the hours stole on towards dawning to feel that there was another\nso close who set as small a value upon his sleep as he did.  Even now,\nas his thoughts turned towards him, Smith's feelings were kindly.\nHastie was a good fellow, but he was rough, strong-fibred, with no\nimagination or sympathy.  He could not tolerate departures from what he\nlooked upon as the model type of manliness.  If a man could not be\nmeasured by a public-school standard, then he was beyond the pale with\nHastie.  Like so many who are themselves robust, he was apt to confuse\nthe constitution with the character, to ascribe to want of principle\nwhat was really a want of circulation.  Smith, with his stronger mind,\nknew his friend's habit, and made allowance for it now as his thoughts\nturned towards the man beneath him.\n\nThere was no return of the singular sound, and Smith was about to turn\nto his work once more, when suddenly there broke out in the silence of\nthe night a hoarse cry, a positive scream--the call of a man who is\nmoved and shaken beyond all control.  Smith sprang out of his chair and\ndropped his book.  He was a man of fairly firm fibre, but there was\nsomething in this sudden, uncontrollable shriek of horror which chilled\nhis blood and pringled in his skin.  Coming in such a place and at such\nan hour, it brought a thousand fantastic possibilities into his head.\nShould he rush down, or was it better to wait?  He had all the national\nhatred of making a scene, and he knew so little of his neighbour that\nhe would not lightly intrude upon his affairs.  For a moment he stood\nin doubt and even as he balanced the matter there was a quick rattle of\nfootsteps upon the stairs, and young Monkhouse Lee, half dressed and as\nwhite as ashes, burst into his room.\n\n\"Come down!\" he gasped.  \"Bellingham's ill.\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith followed him closely down stairs into the\nsitting-room which was beneath his own, and intent as he was upon the\nmatter in hand, he could not but take an amazed glance around him as he\ncrossed the threshold.  It was such a chamber as he had never seen\nbefore--a museum rather than a study.  Walls and ceiling were thickly\ncovered with a thousand strange relics from Egypt and the East.  Tall,\nangular figures bearing burdens or weapons stalked in an uncouth frieze\nround the apartments.  Above were bull-headed, stork-headed,\ncat-headed, owl-headed statues, with viper-crowned, almond-eyed\nmonarchs, and strange, beetle-like deities cut out of the blue Egyptian\nlapis lazuli.  Horus and Isis and Osiris peeped down from every niche\nand shelf, while across the ceiling a true son of Old Nile, a great,\nhanging-jawed crocodile, was slung in a double noose.\n\nIn the centre of this singular chamber was a large, square table,\nlittered with papers, bottles, and the dried leaves of some graceful,\npalm-like plant.  These varied objects had all been heaped together in\norder to make room for a mummy case, which had been conveyed from the\nwall, as was evident from the gap there, and laid across the front of\nthe table.  The mummy itself, a horrid, black, withered thing, like a\ncharred head on a gnarled bush, was lying half out of the case, with\nits clawlike hand and bony forearm resting upon the table.  Propped up\nagainst the sarcophagus was an old yellow scroll of papyrus, and in\nfront of it, in a wooden armchair, sat the owner of the room, his head\nthrown back, his widely-opened eyes directed in a horrified stare to\nthe crocodile above him, and his blue, thick lips puffing loudly with\nevery expiration.\n\n\"My God! he's dying!\" cried Monkhouse Lee distractedly.\n\nHe was a slim, handsome young fellow, olive-skinned and dark-eyed, of a\nSpanish rather than of an English type, with a Celtic intensity of\nmanner which contrasted with the Saxon phlegm of Abercombie Smith.\n\n\"Only a faint, I think,\" said the medical student.  \"Just give me a\nhand with him.  You take his feet.  Now on to the sofa.  Can you kick\nall those little wooden devils off?  What a litter it is!  Now he will\nbe all right if we undo his collar and give him some water.  What has\nhe been up to at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I heard him cry out.  I ran up.  I know him pretty\nwell, you know.  It is very good of you to come down.\"\n\n\"His heart is going like a pair of castanets,\" said Smith, laying his\nhand on the breast of the unconscious man.  \"He seems to me to be\nfrightened all to pieces.  Chuck the water over him!  What a face he\nhas got on him!\"\n\nIt was indeed a strange and most repellent face, for colour and outline\nwere equally unnatural.  It was white, not with the ordinary pallor of\nfear but with an absolutely bloodless white, like the under side of a\nsole.  He was very fat, but gave the impression of having at some time\nbeen considerably fatter, for his skin hung loosely in creases and\nfolds, and was shot with a meshwork of wrinkles.  Short, stubbly brown\nhair bristled up from his scalp, with a pair of thick, wrinkled ears\nprotruding on either side.  His light grey eyes were still open, the\npupils dilated and the balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare.\nIt seemed to Smith as he looked down upon him that he had never seen\nnature's danger signals flying so plainly upon a man's countenance, and\nhis thoughts turned more seriously to the warning which Hastie had\ngiven him an hour before.\n\n\"What the deuce can have frightened him so?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's the mummy.\"\n\n\"The mummy?  How, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It's beastly and morbid.  I wish he would drop it.\nIt's the second fright he has given me.  It was the same last winter.\nI found him just like this, with that horrid thing in front of him.\"\n\n\"What does he want with the mummy, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a crank, you know.  It's his hobby.  He knows more about\nthese things than any man in England.  But I wish he wouldn't!  Ah,\nhe's beginning to come to.\"\n\nA faint tinge of colour had begun to steal back into Bellingham's\nghastly cheeks, and his eyelids shivered like a sail after a calm.  He\nclasped and unclasped his hands, drew a long, thin breath between his\nteeth, and suddenly jerking up his head, threw a glance of recognition\naround him.  As his eyes fell upon the mummy, he sprang off the sofa,\nseized the roll of papyrus, thrust it into a drawer, turned the key,\nand then staggered back on to the sofa.\n\n\"What's up?\" he asked.  \"What do you chaps want?\"\n\n\"You've been shrieking out and making no end of a fuss,\" said Monkhouse\nLee.  \"If our neighbour here from above hadn't come down, I'm sure I\ndon't know what I should have done with you.\"\n\n\"Ah, it's Abercrombie Smith,\" said Bellingham, glancing up at him.\n\"How very good of you to come in!  What a fool I am!  Oh, my God, what\na fool I am!\"\n\nHe sunk his head on to his hands, and burst into peal after peal of\nhysterical laughter.\n\n\"Look here!  Drop it!\" cried Smith, shaking him roughly by the shoulder.\n\n\"Your nerves are all in a jangle.  You must drop these little midnight\ngames with mummies, or you'll be going off your chump.  You're all on\nwires now.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bellingham, \"whether you would be as cool as I am if\nyou had seen----\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  I meant that I wonder if you could sit up at night with\na mummy without trying your nerves.  I have no doubt that you are quite\nright.  I dare say that I have been taking it out of myself too much\nlately.  But I am all right now.  Please don't go, though.  Just wait\nfor a few minutes until I am quite myself.\"\n\n\"The room is very close,\" remarked Lee, throwing open the window and\nletting in the cool night air.\n\n\"It's balsamic resin,\" said Bellingham.  He lifted up one of the dried\npalmate leaves from the table and frizzled it over the chimney of the\nlamp.  It broke away into heavy smoke wreaths, and a pungent, biting\nodour filled the chamber.  \"It's the sacred plant--the plant of the\npriests,\" he remarked.  \"Do you know anything of Eastern languages,\nSmith?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all.  Not a word.\"\n\nThe answer seemed to lift a weight from the Egyptologist's mind.\n\n\"By-the-way,\" he continued, \"how long was it from the time that you ran\ndown, until I came to my senses?\"\n\n\"Not long.  Some four or five minutes.\"\n\n\"I thought it could not be very long,\" said he, drawing a long breath.\n\"But what a strange thing unconsciousness is!  There is no measurement\nto it.  I could not tell from my own sensations if it were seconds or\nweeks.  Now that gentleman on the table was packed up in the days of\nthe eleventh dynasty, some forty centuries ago, and yet if he could\nfind his tongue he would tell us that this lapse of time has been but a\nclosing of the eyes and a reopening of them.  He is a singularly fine\nmummy, Smith.\"\n\nSmith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye\nat the black and twisted form in front of him.  The features, though\nhorribly discoloured, were perfect, and two little nut-like eyes still\nlurked in the depths of the black, hollow sockets.  The blotched skin\nwas drawn tightly from bone to bone, and a tangled wrap of black coarse\nhair fell over the ears.  Two thin teeth, like those of a rat, overlay\nthe shrivelled lower lip.  In its crouching position, with bent joints\nand craned head, there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid\nthing which made Smith's gorge rise.  The gaunt ribs, with their\nparchment-like covering, were exposed, and the sunken, leaden-hued\nabdomen, with the long slit where the embalmer had left his mark; but\nthe lower limbs were wrapt round with coarse yellow bandages.  A number\nof little clove-like pieces of myrrh and of cassia were sprinkled over\nthe body, and lay scattered on the inside of the case.\n\n\"I don't know his name,\" said Bellingham, passing his hand over the\nshrivelled head.  \"You see the outer sarcophagus with the inscriptions\nis missing.  Lot 249 is all the title he has now.  You see it printed\non his case.  That was his number in the auction at which I picked him\nup.\"\n\n\"He has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day,\" remarked\nAbercrombie Smith.\n\n\"He has been a giant.  His mummy is six feet seven in length, and that\nwould be a giant over there, for they were never a very robust race.\nFeel these great knotted bones, too.  He would be a nasty fellow to\ntackle.\"\n\n\"Perhaps these very hands helped to build the stones into the\npyramids,\" suggested Monkhouse Lee, looking down with disgust in his\neyes at the crooked, unclean talons.\n\n\"No fear.  This fellow has been pickled in natron, and looked after in\nthe most approved style.  They did not serve hodsmen in that fashion.\nSalt or bitumen was enough for them.  It has been calculated that this\nsort of thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money.\nOur friend was a noble at the least.  What do you make of that small\ninscription near his feet, Smith?\"\n\n\"I told you that I know no Eastern tongue.\"\n\n\"Ah, so you did.  It is the name of the embalmer, I take it.  A very\nconscientious worker he must have been.  I wonder how many modern works\nwill survive four thousand years?\"\n\nHe kept on speaking lightly and rapidly, but it was evident to\nAbercrombie Smith that he was still palpitating with fear.  His hands\nshook, his lower lip trembled, and look where he would, his eye always\ncame sliding round to his gruesome companion.  Through all his fear,\nhowever, there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner.  His\neye shone, and his footstep, as he paced the room, was brisk and\njaunty.  He gave the impression of a man who has gone through an\nordeal, the marks of which he still bears upon him, but which has\nhelped him to his end.\n\n\"You're not going yet?\" he cried, as Smith rose from the sofa.\n\nAt the prospect of solitude, his fears seemed to crowd back upon him,\nand he stretched out a hand to detain him.\n\n\"Yes, I must go.  I have my work to do.  You are all right now.  I\nthink that with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid\nstudy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not nervous as a rule; and I have unwrapped mummies before.\"\n\n\"You fainted last time,\" observed Monkhouse Lee.\n\n\"Ah, yes, so I did.  Well, I must have a nerve tonic or a course of\nelectricity.  You are not going, Lee?\"\n\n\"I'll do whatever you wish, Ned.\"\n\n\"Then I'll come down with you and have a shake-down on your sofa.\nGood-night, Smith.  I am so sorry to have disturbed you with my\nfoolishness.\"\n\nThey shook hands, and as the medical student stumbled up the spiral and\nirregular stair he heard a key turn in a door, and the steps of his two\nnew acquaintances as they descended to the lower floor.\n\n\nIn this strange way began the acquaintance between Edward Bellingham\nand Abercrombie Smith, an acquaintance which the latter, at least, had\nno desire to push further.  Bellingham, however, appeared to have taken\na fancy to his rough-spoken neighbour, and made his advances in such a\nway that he could hardly be repulsed without absolute brutality.  Twice\nhe called to thank Smith for his assistance, and many times afterwards\nhe looked in with books, papers, and such other civilities as two\nbachelor neighbours can offer each other.  He was, as Smith soon found,\na man of wide reading, with catholic tastes and an extraordinary\nmemory.  His manner, too, was so pleasing and suave that one came,\nafter a time, to overlook his repellent appearance.  For a jaded and\nwearied man he was no unpleasant companion, and Smith found himself,\nafter a time, looking forward to his visits, and even returning them.\n\nClever as he undoubtedly was, however, the medical student seemed to\ndetect a dash of insanity in the man.  He broke out at times into a\nhigh, inflated style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity\nof his life.\n\n\"It is a wonderful thing,\" he cried, \"to feel that one can command\npowers of good and of evil--a ministering angel or a demon of\nvengeance.\"  And again, of Monkhouse Lee, he said,--\"Lee is a good\nfellow, an honest fellow, but he is without strength or ambition.  He\nwould not make a fit partner for a man with a great enterprise.  He\nwould not make a fit partner for me.\"\n\nAt such hints and innuendoes stolid Smith, puffing solemnly at his\npipe, would simply raise his eyebrows and shake his head, with little\ninterjections of medical wisdom as to earlier hours and fresher air.\n\nOne habit Bellingham had developed of late which Smith knew to be a\nfrequent herald of a weakening mind.  He appeared to be forever talking\nto himself.  At late hours of the night, when there could be no visitor\nwith him, Smith could still hear his voice beneath him in a low,\nmuffled monologue, sunk almost to a whisper, and yet very audible in\nthe silence.  This solitary babbling annoyed and distracted the\nstudent, so that he spoke more than once to his neighbour about it.\nBellingham, however, flushed up at the charge, and denied curtly that\nhe had uttered a sound; indeed, he showed more annoyance over the\nmatter than the occasion seemed to demand.\n\nHad Abercrombie Smith had any doubt as to his own ears he had not to go\nfar to find corroboration.  Tom Styles, the little wrinkled man-servant\nwho had attended to the wants of the lodgers in the turret for a longer\ntime than any man's memory could carry him, was sorely put to it over\nthe same matter.\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said he, as he tidied down the top chamber one\nmorning, \"do you think Mr. Bellingham is all right, sir?\"\n\n\"All right, Styles?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.  Right in his head, sir.\"\n\n\"Why should he not be, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, sir.  His habits has changed of late.  He's not\nthe same man he used to be, though I make free to say that he was never\nquite one of my gentlemen, like Mr. Hastie or yourself, sir.  He's took\nto talkin' to himself something awful.  I wonder it don't disturb you.\nI don't know what to make of him, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't know what business it is of yours, Styles.\"\n\n\"Well, I takes an interest, Mr. Smith.  It may be forward of me, but I\ncan't help it.  I feel sometimes as if I was mother and father to my\nyoung gentlemen.  It all falls on me when things go wrong and the\nrelations come.  But Mr. Bellingham, sir.  I want to know what it is\nthat walks about his room sometimes when he's out and when the door's\nlocked on the outside.\"\n\n\"Eh! you're talking nonsense, Styles.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, sir; but I heard it more'n once with my own ears.\"\n\n\"Rubbish, Styles.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.  You'll ring the bell if you want me.\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith gave little heed to the gossip of the old\nman-servant, but a small incident occurred a few days later which left\nan unpleasant effect upon his mind, and brought the words of Styles\nforcibly to his memory.\n\nBellingham had come up to see him late one night, and was entertaining\nhim with an interesting account of the rock tombs of Beni Hassan in\nUpper Egypt, when Smith, whose hearing was remarkably acute, distinctly\nheard the sound of a door opening on the landing below.\n\n\"There's some fellow gone in or out of your room,\" he remarked.\n\nBellingham sprang up and stood helpless for a moment, with the\nexpression of a man who is half incredulous and half afraid.\n\n\"I surely locked it.  I am almost positive that I locked it,\" he\nstammered.  \"No one could have opened it.\"\n\n\"Why, I hear someone coming up the steps now,\" said Smith.\n\nBellingham rushed out through the door, slammed it loudly behind him,\nand hurried down the stairs.  About half-way down Smith heard him stop,\nand thought he caught the sound of whispering.  A moment later the door\nbeneath him shut, a key creaked in a lock, and Bellingham, with beads\nof moisture upon his pale face, ascended the stairs once more, and\nre-entered the room.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said, throwing himself down in a chair.  \"It was\nthat fool of a dog.  He had pushed the door open.  I don't know how I\ncame to forget to lock it.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you kept a dog,\" said Smith, looking very thoughtfully\nat the disturbed face of his companion.\n\n\"Yes, I haven't had him long.  I must get rid of him.  He's a great\nnuisance.\"\n\n\"He must be, if you find it so hard to shut him up.  I should have\nthought that shutting the door would have been enough, without locking\nit.\"\n\n\"I want to prevent old Styles from letting him out.  He's of some\nvalue, you know, and it would be awkward to lose him.\"\n\n\"I am a bit of a dog-fancier myself,\" said Smith, still gazing hard at\nhis companion from the corner of his eyes.  \"Perhaps you'll let me have\na look at it.\"\n\n\"Certainly.  But I am afraid it cannot be to-night; I have an\nappointment.  Is that clock right?  Then I am a quarter of an hour late\nalready.  You'll excuse me, I am sure.\"\n\nHe picked up his cap and hurried from the room.  In spite of his\nappointment, Smith heard him re-enter his own chamber and lock his door\nupon the inside.\n\nThis interview left a disagreeable impression upon the medical\nstudent's mind.  Bellingham had lied to him, and lied so clumsily that\nit looked as if he had desperate reasons for concealing the truth.\nSmith knew that his neighbour had no dog.  He knew, also, that the step\nwhich he had heard upon the stairs was not the step of an animal.  But\nif it were not, then what could it be?  There was old Styles's\nstatement about the something which used to pace the room at times when\nthe owner was absent.  Could it be a woman?  Smith rather inclined to\nthe view.  If so, it would mean disgrace and expulsion to Bellingham if\nit were discovered by the authorities, so that his anxiety and\nfalsehoods might be accounted for.  And yet it was inconceivable that\nan undergraduate could keep a woman in his rooms without being\ninstantly detected.  Be the explanation what it might, there was\nsomething ugly about it, and Smith determined, as he turned to his\nbooks, to discourage all further attempts at intimacy on the part of\nhis soft-spoken and ill-favoured neighbour.\n\nBut his work was destined to interruption that night.  He had hardly\ncaught tip the broken threads when a firm, heavy footfall came three\nsteps at a time from below, and Hastie, in blazer and flannels, burst\ninto the room.\n\n\"Still at it!\" said he, plumping down into his wonted arm-chair.  \"What\na chap you are to stew!  I believe an earthquake might come and knock\nOxford into a cocked hat, and you would sit perfectly placid with your\nbooks among the rains.  However, I won't bore you long.  Three whiffs\nof baccy, and I am off.\"\n\n\"What's the news, then?\" asked Smith, cramming a plug of bird's-eye\ninto his briar with his forefinger.\n\n\"Nothing very much.  Wilson made 70 for the freshmen against the\neleven.  They say that they will play him instead of Buddicomb, for\nBuddicomb is clean off colour.  He used to be able to bowl a little,\nbut it's nothing but half-vollies and long hops now.\"\n\n\"Medium right,\" suggested Smith, with the intense gravity which comes\nupon a 'varsity man when he speaks of athletics.\n\n\"Inclining to fast, with a work from leg.  Comes with the arm about\nthree inches or so.  He used to be nasty on a wet wicket.  Oh,\nby-the-way, have you heard about Long Norton?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"He's been attacked.\"\n\n\"Attacked?\"\n\n\"Yes, just as he was turning out of the High Street, and within a\nhundred yards of the gate of Old's.\"\n\n\"But who----\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the rub!  If you said 'what,' you would be more\ngrammatical.  Norton swears that it was not human, and, indeed, from\nthe scratches on his throat, I should be inclined to agree with him.\"\n\n\"What, then?  Have we come down to spooks?\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith puffed his scientific contempt.\n\n\"Well, no; I don't think that is quite the idea, either.  I am inclined\nto think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately, and the brute\nis in these parts, a jury would find a true bill against it.  Norton\npasses that way every night, you know, about the same hour.  There's a\ntree that hangs low over the path--the big elm from Rainy's garden.\nNorton thinks the thing dropped on him out of the tree.  Anyhow, he was\nnearly strangled by two arms, which, he says, were as strong and as\nthin as steel bands.  He saw nothing; only those beastly arms that\ntightened and tightened on him.  He yelled his head nearly off, and a\ncouple of chaps came running, and the thing went over the wall like a\ncat.  He never got a fair sight of it the whole time.  It gave Norton a\nshake up, I can tell you.  I tell him it has been as good as a change\nat the sea-side for him.\"\n\n\"A garrotter, most likely,\" said Smith.\n\n\"Very possibly.  Norton says not; but we don't mind what he says.  The\ngarrotter had long nails, and was pretty smart at swinging himself over\nwalls.  By-the-way, your beautiful neighbour would be pleased if he\nheard about it.  He had a grudge against Norton, and he's not a man,\nfrom what I know of him, to forget his little debts.  But hallo, old\nchap, what have you got in your noddle?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Smith answered curtly.\n\nHe had started in his chair, and the look had flashed over his face\nwhich comes upon a man who is struck suddenly by some unpleasant idea.\n\n\"You looked as if something I had said had taken you on the raw.\nBy-the-way, you have made the acquaintance of Master B. since I looked\nin last, have you not?  Young Monkhouse Lee told me something to that\neffect.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know him slightly.  He has been up here once or twice.\"\n\n\"Well, you're big enough and ugly enough to take care of yourself.\nHe's not what I should call exactly a healthy sort of Johnny, though,\nno doubt, he's very clever, and all that.  But you'll soon find out for\nyourself.  Lee is all right; he's a very decent little fellow.  Well,\nso long, old chap!  I row Mullins for the Vice-Chancellor's pot on\nWednesday week, so mind you come down, in case I don't see you before.\"\n\nBovine Smith laid down his pipe and turned stolidly to his books once\nmore.  But with all the will in the world, he found it very hard to\nkeep his mind upon his work.  It would slip away to brood upon the man\nbeneath him, and upon the little mystery which hung round his chambers.\nThen his thoughts turned to this singular attack of which Hastie had\nspoken, and to the grudge which Bellingham was said to owe the object\nof it.  The two ideas would persist in rising together in his mind, as\nthough there were some close and intimate connection between them.  And\nyet the suspicion was so dim and vague that it could not be put down in\nwords.\n\n\"Confound the chap!\" cried Smith, as he shied his book on pathology\nacross the room.  \"He has spoiled my night's reading, and that's reason\nenough, if there were no other, why I should steer clear of him in the\nfuture.\"\n\nFor ten days the medical student confined himself so closely to his\nstudies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men\nbeneath him.  At the hours when Bellingham had been accustomed to visit\nhim, he took care to sport his oak, and though he more than once heard\na knocking at his outer door, he resolutely refused to answer it.  One\nafternoon, however, he was descending the stairs when, just as he was\npassing it, Bellingham's door flew open, and young Monkhouse Lee came\nout with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive\ncheeks.  Close at his heels followed Bellingham, his fat, unhealthy\nface all quivering with malignant passion.\n\n\"You fool!\" he hissed.  \"You'll  be  sorry.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" cried the other.  \"Mind what I say.  It's off!  I won't\nhear of it!\"\n\n\"You've promised, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll keep that!  I won't speak.  But I'd rather little Eva was in\nher grave.  Once for all, it's off.  She'll do what I say.  We don't\nwant to see you again.\"\n\nSo much Smith could not avoid hearing, but he hurried on, for he had no\nwish to be involved in their dispute.  There had been a serious breach\nbetween them, that was clear enough, and Lee was going to cause the\nengagement with his sister to be broken off.  Smith thought of Hastie's\ncomparison of the toad and the dove, and was glad to think that the\nmatter was at an end.  Bellingham's face when he was in a passion was\nnot pleasant to look upon.  He was not a man to whom an innocent girl\ncould be trusted for life.  As he walked, Smith wondered languidly what\ncould have caused the quarrel, and what the promise might be which\nBellingham had been so anxious that Monkhouse Lee should keep.\n\nIt was the day of the sculling match between Hastie and Mullins, and a\nstream of men were making their way down to the banks of the Isis.  A\nMay sun was shining brightly, and the yellow path was barred with the\nblack shadows of the tall elm-trees.  On either side the grey colleges\nlay back from the road, the hoary old mothers of minds looking out from\ntheir high, mullioned windows at the tide of young life which swept so\nmerrily past them.  Black-clad tutors, prim officials, pale reading\nmen, brown-faced, straw-hatted young athletes in white sweaters or\nmany-coloured blazers, all were hurrying towards the blue winding river\nwhich curves through the Oxford meadows.\n\nAbercrombie Smith, with the intuition of an old oarsman, chose his\nposition at the point where he knew that the struggle, if there were a\nstruggle, would come.  Far off he heard the hum which announced the\nstart, the gathering roar of the approach, the thunder of running feet,\nand the shouts of the men in the boats beneath him.  A spray of\nhalf-clad, deep-breathing runners shot past him, and craning over their\nshoulders, he saw Hastie pulling a steady thirty-six, while his\nopponent, with a jerky forty, was a good boat's length behind him.\nSmith gave a cheer for his friend, and pulling out his watch, was\nstarting off again for his chambers, when he felt a touch upon his\nshoulder, and found that young Monkhouse Lee was beside him.\n\n\"I saw you there,\" he said, in a timid, deprecating way.  \"I wanted to\nspeak to you, if you could spare me a half-hour.  This cottage is mine.\nI share it with Harrington of King's.  Come in and have a cup of tea.\"\n\n\"I must be back presently,\" said Smith.  \"I am hard on the grind at\npresent.  But I'll come in for a few minutes with pleasure.  I wouldn't\nhave come out only Hastie is a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"So he is of mine.  Hasn't he a beautiful style?  Mullins wasn't in it.\nBut come into the cottage.  It's a little den of a place, but it is\npleasant to work in during the summer months.\"\n\nIt was a small, square, white building, with green doors and shutters,\nand a rustic trellis-work porch, standing back some fifty yards from\nthe river's bank.  Inside, the main room was roughly fitted up as a\nstudy--deal table, unpainted shelves with books, and a few cheap\noleographs upon the wall.  A kettle sang upon a spirit-stove, and there\nwere tea things upon a tray on the table.\n\n\"Try that chair and have a cigarette,\" said Lee.  \"Let me pour you out\na cup of tea.  It's so good of you to come in, for I know that your\ntime is a good deal taken up.  I wanted to say to you that, if I were\nyou, I should change my rooms at once.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nSmith sat staring with a lighted match in one hand and his unlit\ncigarette in the other.\n\n\"Yes; it must seem very extraordinary, and the worst of it is that I\ncannot give my reasons, for I am under a solemn promise--a very solemn\npromise.  But I may go so far as to say that I don't think Bellingham\nis a very safe man to live near.  I intend to camp out here as much as\nI can for a time.\"\n\n\"Not safe!  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's what I mustn't say.  But do take my advice, and move your\nrooms.  We had a grand row to-day.  You must have heard us, for you\ncame down the stairs.\"\n\n\"I saw that you had fallen out.\"\n\n\"He's a horrible chap, Smith.  That is the only word for him.  I have\nhad doubts about him ever since that night when he fainted--you\nremember, when you came down.  I taxed him to-day, and he told me\nthings that made my hair rise, and wanted me to stand in with him.  I'm\nnot strait-laced, but I am a clergyman's son, you know, and I think\nthere are some things which are quite beyond the pale.  I only thank\nGod that I found him out before it was too late, for he was to have\nmarried into my family.\"\n\n\"This is all very fine, Lee,\" said Abercrombie Smith curtly.  \"But\neither you are saying a great deal too much or a great deal too little.\"\n\n\"I give you a warning.\"\n\n\"If there is real reason for warning, no promise can bind you.  If I\nsee a rascal about to blow a place up with dynamite no pledge will\nstand in my way of preventing him.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I cannot prevent him, and I can do nothing but warn you.\"\n\n\"Without saying what you warn me against.\"\n\n\"Against Bellingham.\"\n\n\"But that is childish.  Why should I fear him, or any man?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you.  I can only entreat you to change your rooms.  You\nare in danger where you are.  I don't even say that Bellingham would\nwish to injure you.  But it might happen, for he is a dangerous\nneighbour just now.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I know more than you think,\" said Smith, looking keenly at the\nyoung man's boyish, earnest face.  \"Suppose I tell you that some one\nelse shares Bellingham's rooms.\"\n\nMonkhouse Lee sprang from his chair in uncontrollable excitement.\n\n\"You know, then?\" he gasped.\n\n\"A woman.\"\n\nLee dropped back again with a groan.\n\n\"My lips are sealed,\" he said.  \"I must not speak.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Smith, rising, \"it is not likely that I should\nallow myself to be frightened out of rooms which suit me very nicely.\nIt would be a little too feeble for me to move out all my goods and\nchattels because you say that Bellingham might in some unexplained way\ndo me an injury.  I think that I'll just take my chance, and stay where\nI am, and as I see that it's nearly five o'clock, I must ask you to\nexcuse me.\"\n\nHe bade the young student adieu in a few curt words, and made his way\nhomeward through the sweet spring evening feeling half-ruffled,\nhalf-amused, as any other strong, unimaginative man might who has been\nmenaced by a vague and shadowy danger.\n\nThere was one little indulgence which Abercrombie Smith always allowed\nhimself, however closely his work might press upon him.  Twice a week,\non the Tuesday and the Friday, it was his invariable custom to walk\nover to Farlingford, the residence of Dr. Plumptree Peterson, situated\nabout a mile and a half out of Oxford.  Peterson had been a close\nfriend of Smith's elder brother Francis, and as he was a bachelor,\nfairly well-to-do, with a good cellar and a better library, his house\nwas a pleasant goal for a man who was in need of a brisk walk.  Twice a\nweek, then, the medical student would swing out there along the dark\ncountry roads, and spend a pleasant hour in Peterson's comfortable\nstudy, discussing, over a glass of old port, the gossip of the 'varsity\nor the latest developments of medicine or of surgery.\n\nOn the day which followed his interview with Monkhouse Lee, Smith shut\nup his books at a quarter past eight, the hour when he usually started\nfor his friend's house.  As he was leaving his room, however, his eyes\nchanced to fall upon one of the books which Bellingham had lent him,\nand his conscience pricked him for not having returned it.  However\nrepellent the man might be, he should not be treated with discourtesy.\nTaking the book, he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbour's\ndoor.  There was no answer; but on turning the handle he found that it\nwas unlocked.  Pleased at the thought of avoiding an interview, he\nstepped inside, and placed the book with his card upon the table.\n\nThe lamp was turned half down, but Smith could see the details of the\nroom plainly enough.  It was all much as he had seen it before--the\nfrieze, the animal-headed gods, the banging crocodile, and the table\nlittered over with papers and dried leaves.  The mummy case stood\nupright against the wall, but the mummy itself was missing.  There was\nno sign of any second occupant of the room, and he felt as he withdrew\nthat he had probably done Bellingham an injustice.  Had he a guilty\nsecret to preserve, he would hardly leave his door open so that all the\nworld might enter.\n\nThe spiral stair was as black as pitch, and Smith was slowly making his\nway down its irregular steps, when he was suddenly conscious that\nsomething had passed him in the darkness.  There was a faint sound, a\nwhiff of air, a light brushing past his elbow, but so slight that he\ncould scarcely be certain of it.  He stopped and listened, but the wind\nwas rustling among the ivy outside, and he could hear nothing else.\n\n\"Is that you, Styles?\" he shouted.\n\nThere was no answer, and all was still behind him.  It must have been a\nsudden gust of air, for there were crannies and cracks in the old\nturret.  And yet he could almost have sworn that he heard a footfall by\nhis very side.  He had emerged into the quadrangle, still turning the\nmatter over in his head, when a man came running swiftly across the\nsmooth-cropped lawn.\n\n\"Is that you, Smith?\"\n\n\"Hullo, Hastie!\"\n\n\"For God's sake come at once!  Young Lee is drowned!  Here's Harrington\nof King's with the news.  The doctor is out.  You'll do, but come along\nat once.  There may be life in him.\"\n\n\"Have you brandy?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll bring some.  There's a flask on my table.\"\n\nSmith bounded up the stairs, taking three at a time, seized the flask,\nand was rushing down with it, when, as he passed Bellingham's room, his\neyes fell upon something which left him gasping and staring upon the\nlanding.\n\nThe door, which he had closed behind him, was now open, and right in\nfront of him, with the lamp-light shining upon it, was the mummy case.\nThree minutes ago it had been empty.  He could swear to that.  Now it\nframed the lank body of its horrible occupant, who stood, grim and\nstark, with his black shrivelled face towards the door.  The form was\nlifeless and inert, but it seemed to Smith as he gazed that there still\nlingered a lurid spark of vitality, some faint sign of consciousness in\nthe little eyes which lurked in the depths of the hollow sockets.  So\nastounded and shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand, and was\nstill staring at the lean, sunken figure when the voice of his friend\nbelow recalled him to himself.\n\n\"Come on, Smith!\" he shouted.  \"It's life and death, you know.  Hurry\nup!  Now, then,\" he added, as the medical student reappeared, \"let us\ndo a sprint.  It is well under a mile, and we should do it in five\nminutes.  A human life is better worth running for than a pot.\"\n\nNeck and neck they dashed through the darkness, and did not pull up\nuntil, panting and spent, they had reached the little cottage by the\nriver.  Young Lee, limp and dripping like a broken water-plant, was\nstretched upon the sofa, the green scum of the river upon his black\nhair, and a fringe of white foam upon his leaden-hued lips.  Beside him\nknelt his fellow-student Harrington, endeavouring to chafe some warmth\nback into his rigid limbs.\n\n\"I think there's life in him,\" said Smith, with his hand to the lad's\nside.  \"Put your watch glass to his lips.  Yes, there's dimming on it.\nYou take one arm, Hastie.  Now work it as I do, and we'll soon pull him\nround.\"\n\nFor ten minutes they worked in silence, inflating and depressing the\nchest of the unconscious man.  At the end of that time a shiver ran\nthrough his body, his lips trembled, and he opened his eyes.  The three\nstudents burst out into an irrepressible cheer.\n\n\"Wake up, old chap.  You've frightened us quite enough.\"\n\n\"Have some brandy.  Take a sip from the flask.\"\n\n\"He's all right now,\" said his companion Harrington.  \"Heavens, what a\nfright I got!  I was reading here, and he had gone for a stroll as far\nas the river, when I heard a scream and a splash.  Out I ran, and by\nthe time that I could find him and fish him out, all life seemed to\nhave gone.  Then Simpson couldn't get a doctor, for he has a game-leg,\nand I had to run, and I don't know what I'd have done without you\nfellows.  That's right, old chap.  Sit up.\"\n\nMonkhouse Lee had raised himself on his hands, and looked wildly about\nhim.\n\n\"What's up?\" he asked.  \"I've been in the water.  Ah, yes; I remember.\"\n\nA look of fear came into his eyes, and he sank his face into his hands.\n\n\"How did you fall in?\"\n\n\"I didn't fall in.\"\n\n\"How, then?\"\n\n\"I was thrown in.  I was standing by the bank, and something from\nbehind picked me up like a feather and hurled me in.  I heard nothing,\nand I saw nothing.  But I know what it was, for all that.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" whispered Smith.\n\nLee looked up with a quick glance of surprise.  \"You've learned, then!\"\nhe said.  \"You remember the advice I gave you?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I begin to think that I shall take it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the deuce you fellows are talking about,\" said\nHastie, \"but I think, if I were you, Harrington, I should get Lee to\nbed at once.  It will be time enough to discuss the why and the\nwherefore when he is a little stronger.  I think, Smith, you and I can\nleave him alone now.  I am walking back to college; if you are coming\nin that direction, we can have a chat.\"\n\nBut it was little chat that they had upon their homeward path.  Smith's\nmind was too full of the incidents of the evening, the absence of the\nmummy from his neighbour's rooms, the step that passed him on the\nstair, the reappearance--the extraordinary, inexplicable reappearance\nof the grisly thing--and then this attack upon Lee, corresponding so\nclosely to the previous outrage upon another man against whom\nBellingham bore a grudge.  All this settled in his thoughts, together\nwith the many little incidents which had previously turned him against\nhis neighbour, and the singular circumstances under which he was first\ncalled in to him.  What had been a dim suspicion, a vague, fantastic\nconjecture, had suddenly taken form, and stood out in his mind as a\ngrim fact, a thing not to be denied.  And yet, how monstrous it was!\nhow unheard of! how entirely beyond all bounds of human experience.  An\nimpartial judge, or even the friend who walked by his side, would\nsimply tell him that his eyes had deceived him, that the mummy had been\nthere all the time, that young Lee had tumbled into the river as any\nother man tumbles into a river, and that a blue pill was the best thing\nfor a disordered liver.  He felt that he would have said as much if the\npositions had been reversed.  And yet he could swear that Bellingham\nwas a murderer at heart, and that he wielded a weapon such as no man\nhad ever used in all the grim history of crime.\n\nHastie had branched off to his rooms with a few crisp and emphatic\ncomments upon his friend's unsociability, and Abercrombie Smith crossed\nthe quadrangle to his corner turret with a strong feeling of repulsion\nfor his chambers and their associations.  He would take Lee's advice,\nand move his quarters as soon as possible, for how could a man study\nwhen his ear was ever straining for every murmur or footstep in the\nroom below?  He observed, as he crossed over the lawn, that the light\nwas still shining in Bellingham's window, and as he passed up the\nstaircase the door opened, and the man himself looked out at him.  With\nhis fat, evil face he was like some bloated spider fresh from the\nweaving of his poisonous web.\n\n\"Good-evening,\" said he.  \"Won't you come in?\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Smith, fiercely.\n\n\"No?  You are busy as ever?  I wanted to ask you about Lee.  I was\nsorry to hear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with\nhim.\"\n\nHis features were grave, but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh in\nhis eyes as he spoke.  Smith saw it, and he could have knocked him down\nfor it.\n\n\"You'll be sorrier still to hear that Monkhouse Lee is doing very well,\nand is out of all danger,\" he answered.  \"Your hellish tricks have not\ncome off this time.  Oh, you needn't try to brazen it out.  I know all\nabout it.\"\n\nBellingham took a step back from the angry student, and half-closed the\ndoor as if to protect himself.\n\n\"You are mad,\" he said.  \"What do you mean?  Do you assert that I had\nanything to do with Lee's accident?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" thundered Smith.  \"You and that bag of bones behind you; you\nworked it between you.  I tell you what it is, Master B., they have\ngiven up burning folk like you, but we still keep a hangman, and, by\nGeorge! if any man in this college meets his death while you are here,\nI'll have you up, and if you don't swing for it, it won't be my fault.\nYou'll find that your filthy Egyptian tricks won't answer in England.\"\n\n\"You're a raving lunatic,\" said Bellingham.\n\n\"All right.  You just remember what I say, for you'll find that I'll be\nbetter than my word.\"\n\nThe door slammed, and Smith went fuming up to his chamber, where he\nlocked the door upon the inside, and spent half the night in smoking\nhis old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening.\n\nNext morning Abercrombie Smith heard nothing of his neighbour, but\nHarrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that Lee was almost\nhimself again.  All day Smith stuck fast to his work, but in the\nevening he determined to pay the visit to his friend Dr. Peterson upon\nwhich he had started upon the night before.  A good walk and a friendly\nchat would be welcome to his jangled nerves.\n\nBellingham's door was shut as he passed, but glancing back when he was\nsome distance from the turret, he saw his neighbour's head at the\nwindow outlined against the lamp-light, his face pressed apparently\nagainst the glass as he gazed out into the darkness.  It was a blessing\nto be away from all contact with him, but if for a few hours, and Smith\nstepped out briskly, and breathed the soft spring air into his lungs.\nThe half-moon lay in the west between two Gothic pinnacles, and threw\nupon the silvered street a dark tracery from the stone-work above.\nThere was a brisk breeze, and light, fleecy clouds drifted swiftly\nacross the sky.  Old's was on the very border of the town, and in five\nminutes Smith found himself beyond the houses and between the hedges of\na May-scented Oxfordshire lane.\n\nIt was a lonely and little frequented road which led to his friend's\nhouse.  Early as it was, Smith did not meet a single soul upon his way.\nHe walked briskly along until he came to the avenue gate, which opened\ninto the long gravel drive leading up to Farlingford.  In front of him\nhe could see the cosy red light of the windows glimmering through the\nfoliage.  He stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the swinging\ngate, and he glanced back at the road along which he had come.\nSomething was coming swiftly down it.\n\nIt moved in the shadow of the hedge, silently and furtively, a dark,\ncrouching figure, dimly visible against the black background.  Even as\nhe gazed back at it, it had lessened its distance by twenty paces, and\nwas fast closing upon him.  Out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a\nscraggy neck, and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams.\nHe turned, and with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue.\nThere were the red lights, the signals of safety, almost within a\nstone's throw of him.  He was a famous runner, but never had he run as\nhe ran that night.\n\nThe heavy gate had swung into place behind him, but he heard it dash\nopen again before his pursuer.  As he rushed madly and wildly through\nthe night, he could hear a swift, dry patter behind him, and could see,\nas he threw back a glance, that this horror was bounding like a tiger\nat his heels, with blazing eyes and one stringy arm outthrown.  Thank\nGod, the door was ajar.  He could see the thin bar of light which shot\nfrom the lamp in the hall.  Nearer yet sounded the clatter from behind.\nHe heard a hoarse gurgling at his very shoulder.  With a shriek he\nflung himself against the door, slammed and bolted it behind him, and\nsank half-fainting on to the hall chair.\n\n\"My goodness, Smith, what's the matter?\" asked Peterson, appearing at\nthe door of his study.\n\n\"Give me some brandy!\"\n\nPeterson disappeared, and came rushing out again with a glass and a\ndecanter.\n\n\"You need it,\" he said, as his visitor drank off what he poured out for\nhim.  \"Why, man, you are as white as a cheese.\"\n\nSmith laid down his glass, rose up, and took a deep breath.\n\n\"I am my own man again now,\" said he.  \"I was never so unmanned before.\nBut, with your leave, Peterson, I will sleep here to-night, for I don't\nthink I could face that road again except by daylight.  It's weak, I\nknow, but I can't help it.\"\n\nPeterson looked at his visitor with a very questioning eye.\n\n\"Of course you shall sleep here if you wish.  I'll tell Mrs. Burney to\nmake up the spare bed.  Where are you off to now?\"\n\n\"Come up with me to the window that overlooks the door.  I want you to\nsee what I have seen.\"\n\nThey went up to the window of the upper hall whence they could look\ndown upon the approach to the house.  The drive and the fields on\neither side lay quiet and still, bathed in the peaceful moonlight.\n\n\"Well, really, Smith,\" remarked Peterson, \"it is well that I know you\nto be an abstemious man.  What in the world can have frightened you?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you presently.  But where can it have gone?  Ah, now look,\nlook!  See the curve of the road just beyond your gate.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see; you needn't pinch my arm off.  I saw someone pass.  I\nshould say a man, rather thin, apparently, and tall, very tall.  But\nwhat of him?  And what of yourself?  You are still shaking like an\naspen leaf.\"\n\n\"I have been within hand-grip of the devil, that's all.  But come down\nto your study, and I shall tell you the whole story.\"\n\nHe did so.  Under the cheery lamplight, with a glass of wine on the\ntable beside him, and the portly form and florid face of his friend in\nfront, he narrated, in their order, all the events, great and small,\nwhich had formed so singular a chain, from the night on which he had\nfound Bellingham fainting in front of the mummy case until his horrid\nexperience of an hour ago.\n\n\"There now,\" he said as he concluded, \"that's the whole black business.\nIt is monstrous and incredible, but it is true.\"\n\nDr. Plumptree Peterson sat for some time in silence with a very puzzled\nexpression upon his face.\n\n\"I never heard of such a thing in my life, never!\" he said at last.\n\"You have told me the facts.  Now tell me your inferences.\"\n\n\"You can draw your own.\"\n\n\"But I should like to hear yours.  You have thought over the matter,\nand I have not.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be a little vague in detail, but the main points seem to\nme to be clear enough.  This fellow Bellingham, in his Eastern studies,\nhas got hold of some infernal secret by which a mummy--or possibly only\nthis particular mummy--can be temporarily brought to life.  He was\ntrying this disgusting business on the night when he fainted.  No doubt\nthe sight of the creature moving had shaken his nerve, even though he\nhad expected it.  You remember that almost the first words he said were\nto call out upon himself as a fool.  Well, he got more hardened\nafterwards, and carried the matter through without fainting.  The\nvitality which he could put into it was evidently only a passing thing,\nfor I have seen it continually in its case as dead as this table.  He\nhas some elaborate process, I fancy, by which he brings the thing to\npass.  Having done it, he naturally bethought him that he might use the\ncreature as an agent.  It has intelligence and it has strength.  For\nsome purpose he took Lee into his confidence; but Lee, like a decent\nChristian, would have nothing to do with such a business.  Then they\nhad a row, and Lee vowed that he would tell his sister of Bellingham's\ntrue character.  Bellingham's game was to prevent him, and he nearly\nmanaged it, by setting this creature of his on his track.  He had\nalready tried its powers upon another man--Norton--towards whom he had\na grudge.  It is the merest chance that he has not two murders upon his\nsoul.  Then, when I taxed him with the matter, he had the strongest\nreasons for wishing to get me out of the way before I could convey my\nknowledge to anyone else.  He got his chance when I went out, for he\nknew my habits, and where I was bound for.  I have had a narrow shave,\nPeterson, and it is mere luck you didn't find me on your doorstep in\nthe morning.  I'm not a nervous man as a rule, and I never thought to\nhave the fear of death put upon me as it was to-night.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you take the matter too seriously,\" said his companion.\n\"Your nerves are out of order with your work, and you make too much of\nit.  How could such a thing as this stride about the streets of Oxford,\neven at night, without being seen?\"\n\n\"It has been seen.  There is quite a scare in the town about an escaped\nape, as they imagine the creature to be.  It is the talk of the place.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a striking chain of events.  And yet, my dear fellow, you\nmust allow that each incident in itself is capable of a more natural\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"What! even my adventure of to-night?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  You come out with your nerves all unstrung, and your head\nfull of this theory of yours.  Some gaunt, half-famished tramp steals\nafter you, and seeing you run, is emboldened to pursue you.  Your fears\nand imagination do the rest.\"\n\n\"It won't do, Peterson; it won't do.\"\n\n\"And again, in the instance of your finding the mummy case empty, and\nthen a few moments later with an occupant, you know that it was\nlamplight, that the lamp was half turned down, and that you had no\nspecial reason to look hard at the case.  It is quite possible that you\nmay have overlooked the creature in the first instance.\"\n\n\"No, no; it is out of the question.\"\n\n\"And then Lee may have fallen into the river, and Norton been\ngarrotted.  It is certainly a formidable indictment that  you have\nagainst Bellingham; but if you were to place it before a police\nmagistrate, he would simply laugh in your face.\"\n\n\"I know he would.  That is why I mean to take the matter into my own\nhands.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Yes; I feel that a public duty rests upon me, and, besides, I must do\nit for my own safety, unless I choose to allow myself to be hunted by\nthis beast out of the college, and that would be a little too feeble.\nI have quite made up my mind what I shall do.  And first of all, may I\nuse your paper and pens for an hour?\"\n\n\"Most certainly.  You will find all that you want upon that side table.\"\n\nAbercrombie Smith sat down before a sheet of foolscap, and for an hour,\nand then for a second hour his pen travelled swiftly over it.  Page\nafter page was finished and tossed aside while his friend leaned back\nin his arm-chair, looking across at him with patient curiosity.  At\nlast, with an exclamation of satisfaction, Smith sprang to his feet,\ngathered his papers up into order, and laid the last one upon\nPeterson's desk.\n\n\"Kindly sign this as a witness,\" he said.\n\n\"A witness?  Of what?\"\n\n\"Of my signature, and of the date.  The date is the most important.\nWhy, Peterson, my life might hang upon it.\"\n\n\"My dear Smith, you are talking wildly.  Let me beg you to go to bed.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I never spoke so deliberately in my life.  And I will\npromise to go to bed the moment you have signed it.\"\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"It is a statement of all that I have been telling you to-night.  I\nwish you to witness it.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Peterson, signing his name under that of his\ncompanion.  \"There you are!  But what is the idea?\"\n\n\"You will kindly retain it, and produce it in case I am arrested.\"\n\n\"Arrested?  For what?\"\n\n\"For murder.  It is quite on the cards.  I wish to be ready for every\nevent.  There is only one course open to me, and I am determined to\ntake it.\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, don't do anything rash!\"\n\n\"Believe me, it would be far more rash to adopt any other course.  I\nhope that we won't need to bother you, but it will ease my mind to know\nthat you have this statement of my motives.  And now I am ready to take\nyour advice and to go to roost, for I want to be at my best in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\nAbercrombie Smith was not an entirely pleasant man to have as an enemy.\nSlow and easytempered, he was formidable when driven to action.  He\nbrought to every purpose in life the same deliberate resoluteness which\nhad distinguished him as a scientific student.  He had laid his studies\naside for a day, but he intended that the day should not be wasted.\nNot a word did he say to his host as to his plans, but by nine o'clock\nhe was well on his way to Oxford.\n\nIn the High Street he stopped at Clifford's, the gun-maker's, and\nbought a heavy revolver, with a box of central-fire cartridges.  Six of\nthem he slipped into the chambers, and half-cocking the weapon, placed\nit in the pocket of his coat.  He then made his way to Hastie's rooms,\nwhere the big oarsman was lounging over his breakfast, with the\nSporting Times propped up against the coffeepot.\n\n\"Hullo!  What's up?\" he asked.  \"Have some coffee?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.  I want you to come with me, Hastie, and do what I ask\nyou.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my boy.\"\n\n\"And bring a heavy stick with you.\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" Hastie stared.  \"Here's a hunting-crop that would fell an ox.\"\n\n\"One other thing.  You have a box of amputating knives.  Give me the\nlongest of them.\"\n\n\"There you are.  You seem to be fairly on the war trail.  Anything\nelse?\"\n\n\"No; that will do.\" Smith placed the knife inside his coat, and led the\nway to the quadrangle.  \"We are neither of us chickens, Hastie,\" said\nhe.  \"I think I can do this job alone, but I take you as a precaution.\nI am going to have a little talk with Bellingham.  If I have only him\nto deal with, I won't, of course, need you.  If I shout, however, up\nyou come, and lam out with your whip as hard as you can lick.  Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"All right.  I'll come if I hear you bellow.\"\n\n\"Stay here, then.  It may be a little time, but don't budge until I\ncome down.\"\n\n\"I'm a fixture.\"\n\nSmith ascended the stairs, opened Bellingham's door and stepped in.\nBellingham was seated behind his table, writing.  Beside him, among his\nlitter of strange possessions, towered the mummy case, with its sale\nnumber 249 still stuck upon its front, and its hideous occupant stiff\nand stark within it.  Smith looked very deliberately round him, closed\nthe door, locked it, took the key from the inside, and then stepping\nacross to the fireplace, struck a match and set the fire alight.\nBellingham sat staring, with amazement and rage upon his bloated face.\n\n\"Well, really now, you make yourself at home,\" he gasped.\n\nSmith sat himself deliberately down, placing his watch upon the table,\ndrew out his pistol, cocked it, and laid it in his lap.  Then he took\nthe long amputating knife from his bosom, and threw it down in front of\nBellingham.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said he, \"just get to work and cut up that mummy.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that it?\" said Bellingham with a sneer.\n\n\"Yes, that is it.  They tell me that the law can't touch you.  But I\nhave a law that will set matters straight.  If in five minutes you have\nnot set to work, I swear by the God who made me that I will put a\nbullet through your brain!\"\n\n\"You would murder me?\"\n\nBellingham had half risen, and his face was the colour of putty.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And for what?\"\n\n\"To stop your mischief.  One minute has gone.\"\n\n\"But what have I done?\"\n\n\"I know and you know.\"\n\n\"This is mere bullying.\"\n\n\"Two minutes are gone.\"\n\n\"But you must give reasons.  You are a madman--a dangerous madman.  Why\nshould I destroy my own property?  It is a valuable mummy.\"\n\n\"You must cut it up, and you must burn it.\"\n\n\"I will do no such thing.\"\n\n\"Four minutes are gone.\"\n\nSmith took up the pistol and he looked towards Bellingham with an\ninexorable face.  As the second-hand stole round, he raised his hand,\nand the finger twitched upon the trigger.\n\n\"There! there! I'll do it!\" screamed Bellingham.\n\nIn frantic haste he caught up the knife and hacked at the figure of the\nmummy, ever glancing round to see the eye and the weapon of his\nterrible visitor bent upon him.  The creature crackled and snapped\nunder every stab of the keen blade.  A thick yellow dust rose up from\nit.  Spices and dried essences rained down upon the floor.  Suddenly,\nwith a rending crack, its backbone snapped asunder, and it fell, a\nbrown heap of sprawling limbs, upon the floor.\n\n\"Now into the fire!\" said Smith.\n\nThe flames leaped and roared as the dried and tinderlike debris was\npiled upon it.  The little room was like the stoke-hole of a steamer\nand the sweat ran down the faces of the two men; but still the one\nstooped and worked, while the other sat watching him with a set face.\nA thick, fat smoke oozed out from the fire, and a heavy smell of burned\nrosin and singed hair filled the air.  In a quarter of an hour a few\ncharred and brittle sticks were all that was left of Lot No. 249.\n\n\"Perhaps that will satisfy you,\" snarled Bellingham, with hate and fear\nin his little grey eyes as he glanced back at his tormenter.\n\n\"No; I must make a clean sweep of all your materials.  We must have no\nmore devil's tricks.  In with all these leaves!  They may have\nsomething to do with it.\"\n\n\"And what now?\" asked Bellingham, when the leaves also had been added\nto the blaze.\n\n\"Now the roll of papyrus which you had on the table that night.  It is\nin that drawer, I think.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" shouted Bellingham.  \"Don't burn that!  Why, man, you don't\nknow what you do.  It is unique; it contains wisdom which is nowhere\nelse to be found.\"\n\n\"Out with it!\"\n\n\"But look here, Smith, you can't really mean it.  I'll share the\nknowledge with you.  I'll teach you all that is in it.  Or, stay, let\nme only copy it before you burn it!\"\n\nSmith stepped forward and turned the key in the drawer.  Taking out the\nyellow, curled roll of paper, he threw it into the fire, and pressed it\ndown with his heel.  Bellingham screamed, and grabbed at it; but Smith\npushed him back, and stood over it until it was reduced to a formless\ngrey ash.\n\n\"Now, Master B.,\" said he, \"I think I have pretty well drawn your\nteeth.  You'll hear from me again, if you return to your old tricks.\nAnd now good-morning, for I must go back to my studies.\"\n\nAnd such is the narrative of Abercrombie Smith as to the singular\nevents which occurred in Old College, Oxford, in the spring of '84.  As\nBellingham left the university immediately afterwards, and was last\nheard of in the Soudan, there is no one who can contradict his\nstatement.  But the wisdom of men is small, and the ways of nature are\nstrange, and who shall put a bound to the dark things which may be\nfound by those who seek for them?\n\n\n\n\nTHE LOS AMIGOS FIASCO.\n\nI used to be the leading practitioner of Los Amigos.  Of course,\neveryone has heard of the great electrical generating gear there.  The\ntown is wide spread, and there are dozens of little townlets and\nvillages all round, which receive their supply from the same centre, so\nthat the works are on a very large scale.  The Los Amigos folk say that\nthey are the largest upon earth, but then we claim that for everything\nin Los Amigos except the gaol and the death-rate.  Those are said to be\nthe smallest.\n\nNow, with so fine an electrical supply, it seemed to be a sinful waste\nof hemp that the Los Amigos criminals should perish in the\nold-fashioned manner.  And then came the news of the eleotrocutions in\nthe East, and how the results had not after all been so instantaneous\nas had been hoped.  The Western Engineers raised their eyebrows when\nthey read of the puny shocks by which these men had perished, and they\nvowed in Los Amigos that when an irreclaimable came their way he should\nbe dealt handsomely by, and have the run of all the big dynamos.  There\nshould be no reserve, said the engineers, but he should have all that\nthey had got.  And what the result of that would be none could predict,\nsave that it must be absolutely blasting and deadly.  Never before had\na man been so charged with electricity as they would charge him.  He\nwas to be smitten by the essence of ten thunderbolts.  Some prophesied\ncombustion, and some disintegration and disappearance.   They were\nwaiting eagerly to settle the question by actual demonstration, and it\nwas just at that moment that Duncan Warner came that way.\n\nWarner had been wanted by the law, and by nobody else, for many years.\nDesperado, murderer, train robber and road agent, he was a man beyond\nthe pale of human pity.  He had deserved a dozen deaths, and the Los\nAmigos folk grudged him so gaudy a one as that.  He seemed to feel\nhimself to be unworthy of it, for he made two frenzied attempts at\nescape.  He was a powerful, muscular man, with a lion head, tangled\nblack locks, and a sweeping beard which covered his broad chest.  When\nhe was tried, there was no finer head in all the crowded court.  It's\nno new thing to find the best face looking from the dock.  But his good\nlooks could not balance his bad deeds.  His advocate did all he knew,\nbut the cards lay against him, and Duncan Warner was handed over to the\nmercy of the big Los Amigos dynamos.\n\nI was there at the committee meeting when the matter was discussed.\nThe town council had chosen four experts to look after the\narrangements.  Three of them  were admirable.  There was Joseph\nM'Conner, the very man who had designed the dynamos, and there was\nJoshua Westmacott, the chairman of the Los Amigos Electrical Supply\nCompany, Limited.  Then there was myself as the chief medical man, and\nlastly an old German of the name of Peter Stulpnagel.  The Germans were\na strong body at Los Amigos, and they all voted for their man.  That\nwas how he got on the committee.  It was said that he had been a\nwonderful electrician at home, and he was eternally working with wires\nand insulators and Leyden jars; but, as he never seemed to get any\nfurther, or to have any results worth publishing he came at last to be\nregarded as a harmless crank, who had made science his hobby.  We three\npractical men smiled when we heard that he had been elected as our\ncolleague, and at the meeting we fixed it all up very nicely among\nourselves without much thought of the old fellow who sat with his ears\nscooped forward in his hands, for he was a trifle hard of hearing,\ntaking no more part in the proceedings than the gentlemen of the press\nwho scribbled their notes on the back benches.\n\nWe did not take long to settle it all.  In New York a strength of some\ntwo thousand volts had been used, and death had not been instantaneous.\nEvidently their shock had been too weak.  Los Amigos should not fall\ninto that error.  The charge should be six times greater, and\ntherefore, of course, it would be six times more effective.  Nothing\ncould possibly be more logical.  The whole concentrated force of the\ngreat dynamos should be employed on Duncan Warner.\n\nSo we three settled it, and had already risen to break up the meeting,\nwhen our silent companion opened his month for the first time.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you appear to me to show an extraordinary\nignorance upon the subject of electricity.  You have not mastered the\nfirst principles of its actions upon a human being.\"\n\nThe committee was about to break into an angry reply to this brusque\ncomment, but the chairman of the Electrical Company tapped his forehead\nto claim its indulgence for the crankiness of the speaker.\n\n\"Pray tell us, sir,\" said he, with an ironical smile, \"what is there in\nour conclusions with which you find fault?\"\n\n\"With your assumption that a large dose of electricity will merely\nincrease the effect of a small dose.  Do you not think it possible that\nit might have an entirely different result?  Do you know anything, by\nactual experiment, of the effect of such powerful shocks?\"\n\n\"We know it by analogy,\" said the chairman, pompously.  \"All drugs\nincrease their effect when they increase their dose; for example--for\nexample----\"\n\n\"Whisky,\" said Joseph M'Connor.\n\n\"Quite so.  Whisky.  You see it there.\"\n\nPeter Stulpnagel smiled and shook his head.\n\n\"Your argument is not very good,\" said he.  \"When I used to take\nwhisky, I used to find that one glass would excite me, but that six\nwould send me to sleep, which is just the opposite.  Now, suppose that\nelectricity were to act in just the opposite way also, what then?\"\n\nWe three practical men burst out laughing.  We had known that our\ncolleague was queer, but we never had thought that he would be as queer\nas this.\n\n\"What then?\" repeated Philip Stulpnagel.\n\n\"We'll take our chances,\" said the chairman.\n\n\"Pray consider,\" said Peter, \"that workmen who have touched the wires,\nand who have received shocks of only a few hundred volts, have died\ninstantly.  The fact is well known.  And yet when a much greater force\nwas used upon a criminal at New York, the man struggled for some little\ntime.  Do you not clearly see that the smaller dose is the more deadly?\"\n\n\"I think, gentlemen, that this discussion has been carried on quite\nlong enough,\" said the chairman, rising again.  \"The point, I take it,\nhas already been decided by the majority of the committee, and Duncan\nWarner shall be electrocuted on Tuesday by the full strength of the Los\nAmigos dynamos.  Is it not so?\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Joseph M'Connor.\n\n\"I agree,\" said I.\n\n\"And I protest,\" said Peter Stulpnagel.\n\n\"Then the motion is carried, and your protest will be duly entered in\nthe minutes,\" said the chairman, and so the sitting was dissolved.\n\nThe attendance at the electrocution was a very small one.  We four\nmembers of the committee were, of course, present with the executioner,\nwho was to act under their orders.  The others were the United States\nMarshal, the governor of the gaol, the chaplain, and three members of\nthe press.  The room was a small brick chamber, forming an outhouse to\nthe Central Electrical station.  It had been used as a laundry, and had\nan oven and copper at one side, but no other furniture save a single\nchair for the condemned man.  A metal plate for his feet was placed in\nfront of it, to which ran a thick, insulated wire.  Above, another wire\ndepended from the ceiling, which could be connected with a small\nmetallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his\nhead.  When this connection was established Duncan Warner's hour was\ncome.\n\nThere was a solemn hush as we waited for the coming of the prisoner.\nThe practical engineers looked a little pale, and fidgeted nervously\nwith the wires.  Even the hardened Marshal was ill at ease, for a mere\nhanging was one thing, and this blasting of flesh and blood a very\ndifferent one.  As to the pressmen, their faces were whiter than the\nsheets which lay before them.  The only man who appeared to feel none\nof the influence of these preparations was the little German crank, who\nstrolled from one to the other with a smile on his lips and mischief in\nhis eyes.  More than once he even went so far as to burst into a shout\nof laughter, until the chaplain sternly rebuked him for his ill-timed\nlevity.\n\n\"How can you so far forget yourself, Mr. Stulpnagel,\" said he, \"as to\njest in the presence of death?\"\n\nBut the German was quite unabashed.\n\n\"If I were in the presence of death I should not jest,\" said he, \"but\nsince I am not I may do what I choose.\"\n\nThis flippant reply was about to draw another and a sterner reproof\nfrom the chaplain, when the door was swung open and two warders entered\nleading Duncan Warner between them.  He glanced round him with a set\nface, stepped resolutely forward, and seated himself upon the chair.\n\n\"Touch her off!\" said he.\n\nIt was barbarous to keep him in suspense.  The chaplain murmured a few\nwords in his ear, the attendant placed the cap upon his head, and then,\nwhile we all held our breath, the wire and the metal were brought in\ncontact.\n\n\"Great Scott!\" shouted Duncan Warner.\n\nHe had bounded in his chair as the frightful shock crashed through his\nsystem.  But he was not dead.  On the contrary, his eyes gleamed far\nmore brightly than they had done before.  There was only one change,\nbut it was a singular one.  The black had passed from his hair and\nbeard as the shadow passes from a landscape.  They were both as white\nas snow.  And yet there was no other sign of decay.  His skin was\nsmooth and plump and lustrous as a child's.\n\nThe Marshal looked at the committee with a reproachful eye.\n\n\"There seems to be some hitch here, gentlemen,\" said he.\n\nWe three practical men looked at each other.\n\nPeter Stulpnagel smiled pensively.\n\n\"I think that another one should do it,\" said I.\n\nAgain the connection was made, and again Duncan Warner sprang in his\nchair and shouted, but, indeed, were it not that he still remained in\nthe chair none of us would have recognised him.  His hair and his beard\nhad shredded off in an instant, and the room looked like a barber's\nshop on a Saturday night.  There he sat, his eyes still shining, his\nskin radiant with the glow of perfect health, but with a scalp as bald\nas a Dutch cheese, and a chin without so much as a trace of down.  He\nbegan to revolve one of his arms, slowly and doubtfully at first, but\nwith more confidence as he went on.\n\n\"That jint,\" said he, \"has puzzled half the doctors on the Pacific\nSlope.  It's as good as new, and as limber as a hickory twig.\"\n\n\"You are feeling pretty well?\" asked the old German.\n\n\"Never better in my life,\" said Duncan Warner cheerily.\n\nThe situation was a painful one.  The Marshal glared at the committee.\nPeter Stulpnagel grinned and rubbed his hands.  The engineers scratched\ntheir heads.  The bald-headed prisoner revolved his arm and looked\npleased.\n\n\"I think that one more shock----\" began the chairman.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the Marshal \"we've had foolery enough for one morning.\nWe are here for an execution, and a execution we'll have.\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\"\n\n\"There's a hook handy upon the ceiling.  Fetch in a rope, and we'll\nsoon set this matter straight.\"\n\nThere was another awkward delay while the warders departed for the\ncord.  Peter Stulpnagel bent over Duncan Warner, and whispered\nsomething in his ear.  The desperado started in surprise.\n\n\"You don't say?\" he asked.\n\nThe German nodded.\n\n\"What!  Noways?\"\n\nPeter shook his head, and the two began to laugh as though they shared\nsome huge joke between them.\n\nThe rope was brought, and the Marshal himself slipped the noose over\nthe criminal's neck.  Then the two warders, the assistant and he swung\ntheir victim into the air.  For half an hour he hung--a dreadful\nsight--from the ceiling.  Then in solemn silence they lowered him down,\nand one of the warders went out to order the shell to be brought round.\nBut as he touched ground again what was our amazement when Duncan\nWarner put his hands up to his neck, loosened the noose, and took a\nlong, deep breath.\n\n\"Paul Jefferson's sale is goin' well,\" he remarked, \"I could see the\ncrowd from up yonder,\" and he nodded at the hook in the ceiling.\n\n\"Up with him again!\" shouted the Marshal, \"we'll get the life out of\nhim somehow.\"\n\nIn an instant the victim was up at the hook once more.\n\nThey kept him there for an hour, but when he came down he was perfectly\ngarrulous.\n\n\"Old man Plunket goes too much to the Arcady Saloon,\" said he.  \"Three\ntimes he's been there in an hour; and him with a family.  Old man\nPlunket would do well to swear off.\"\n\nIt was monstrous and incredible, but there it was.  There was no\ngetting round it.  The man was there talking when he ought to have been\ndead.  We all sat staring in amazement, but United States Marshal\nCarpenter was not a man to be euchred so easily.  He motioned the\nothers to one side, so that the prisoner was left standing alone.\n\n\"Duncan Warner,\" said he, slowly, \"you are here to play your part, and\nI am here to play mine.  Your game is to live if you can, and my game\nis to carry out the sentence of the law.  You've beat us on\nelectricity.  I'll give you one there.  And you've beat us on hanging,\nfor you seem to thrive on it.  But it's my turn to beat you now, for my\nduty has to be done.\"\n\nHe pulled a six-shooter from his coat as he spoke, and fired all the\nshots through the body of the prisoner.  The room was so filled with\nsmoke that we could see nothing, but when it cleared the prisoner was\nstill standing there, looking down in disgust at the front of his coat.\n\n\"Coats must be cheap where you come from,\" said he.  \"Thirty dollars it\ncost me, and look at it now.  The six holes in front are bad enough,\nbut four of the balls have passed out, and a pretty state the back must\nbe in.\"\n\nThe Marshal's revolver fell from his hand, and he dropped his arms to\nhis sides, a beaten man.\n\n\"Maybe some of you gentlemen can tell me what this means,\" said he,\nlooking helplessly at the committee.\n\nPeter Stulpnagel took a step forward.\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it,\" said he.\n\n\"You seem to be the only person who knows anything.\"\n\n\"I AM the only person who knows anything.  I should have warned these\ngentlemen; but, as they would not listen to me, I have allowed them to\nlearn by experience.  What you have done with your electricity is that\nyou have increased this man's vitality until he can defy death for\ncenturies.\"\n\n\"Centuries!\"\n\n\"Yes, it will take the wear of hundreds of years to exhaust the\nenormous nervous energy with which you have drenched him.  Electricity\nis life, and you have charged him with it to the utmost.  Perhaps in\nfifty years you might execute him, but I am not sanguine about it.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!  What shall I do with him?\" cried the unhappy Marshal.\n\nPeter Stulpnagel shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It seems to me that it does not much matter what you do with him now,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Maybe we could drain the electricity out of him again.  Suppose we\nhang him up by the heels?\"\n\n\"No, no, it's out of the question.\"\n\n\"Well, well, he shall do no more mischief in Los Amigos, anyhow,\" said\nthe Marshal, with decision.  \"He shall go into the new gaol.  The\nprison will wear him out.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Peter Stulpnagel, \"I think that it is much more\nprobable that he will wear out the prison.\"\n\nIt was rather a fiasco and for years we didn't talk more about it than\nwe could help, but it's no secret now and I thought you might like to\njot down the facts in your case-book.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOCTORS OF HOYLAND.\n\nDr. James Ripley was always looked upon as an exceedingly lucky dog by\nall of the profession who knew him.  His father had preceded him in a\npractice in the village of Hoyland, in the north of Hampshire, and all\nwas ready for him on the very first day that the law allowed him to put\nhis name at the foot of a prescription.  In a few years the old\ngentleman retired, and settled on the South Coast, leaving his son in\nundisputed possession of the whole country side.  Save for Dr. Horton,\nnear Basingstoke, the young surgeon had a clear run of six miles in\nevery direction, and took his fifteen hundred pounds a year, though, as\nis usual in country practices, the stable swallowed up most of what the\nconsulting-room earned.\n\nDr. James Ripley was two-and-thirty years of age, reserved, learned,\nunmarried, with set, rather stern features, and a thinning of the dark\nhair upon the top of his head, which was worth quite a hundred a year\nto him.  He was particularly happy in his management of ladies.  He had\ncaught the tone of bland sternness and decisive suavity which dominates\nwithout offending.  Ladies, however, were not equally happy in their\nmanagement of him.  Professionally, he was always at their service.\nSocially, he was a drop of quicksilver.  In vain the country mammas\nspread out their simple lures in front of him.  Dances and picnics were\nnot to his taste, and he preferred during his scanty leisure to shut\nhimself up in his study, and to bury himself in Virchow's Archives and\nthe professional journals.\n\nStudy was a passion with him, and he would have none of the rust which\noften gathers round a country practitioner.  It was his ambition to\nkeep his knowledge as fresh and bright as at the moment when he had\nstepped out of the examination hall.  He prided himself on being able\nat a moment's notice to rattle off the seven ramifications of some\nobscure artery, or to give the exact percentage of any physiological\ncompound.  After a long day's work he would sit up half the night\nperforming iridectomies and extractions upon the sheep's eyes sent in\nby the village butcher, to the horror of his housekeeper, who had to\nremove the debris next morning.  His love for his work was the one\nfanaticism which found a place in his dry, precise nature.\n\nIt was the more to his credit that he should keep up to date in his\nknowledge, since he had no competition to force him to exertion.  In\nthe seven years during which he had practised in Hoyland three rivals\nhad pitted themselves against him, two in the village itself and one in\nthe neighbouring hamlet of Lower Hoyland.  Of these one had sickened\nand wasted, being, as it was said, himself the only patient whom he had\ntreated during his eighteen months of ruralising.  A second had bought\na fourth share of a Basingstoke practice, and had departed honourably,\nwhile a third had vanished one September night, leaving a gutted house\nand an unpaid drug bill behind him.  Since then the district had become\na monopoly, and no one had dared to measure himself against the\nestablished fame of the Hoyland doctor.\n\nIt was, then, with a feeling of some surprise and considerable\ncuriosity that on driving through Lower Hoyland one morning he\nperceived that the new house at the end of the village was occupied,\nand that a virgin brass plate glistened upon the swinging gate which\nfaced the high road.  He pulled up his fifty guinea chestnut mare and\ntook a good look at it.  \"Verrinder Smith, M. D.,\" was printed across\nit in very neat, small lettering.  The last man had had letters half a\nfoot long, with a lamp like a fire-station.  Dr. James Ripley noted the\ndifference, and deduced from it that the new-comer might possibly prove\na more formidable opponent.  He was convinced of it that evening when\nhe came to consult the current medical directory.  By it he learned\nthat Dr. Verrinder Smith was the holder of superb degrees, that he had\nstudied with distinction at Edinburgh, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, and\nfinally that he had been awarded a gold medal and the Lee Hopkins\nscholarship for original research, in recognition of an exhaustive\ninquiry into the functions of the anterior spinal nerve roots.  Dr.\nRipley passed his fingers through his thin hair in bewilderment as he\nread his rival's record.  What on earth could so brilliant a man mean\nby putting up his plate in a little Hampshire hamlet.\n\nBut Dr. Ripley furnished himself with an explanation to the riddle.  No\ndoubt Dr. Verrinder Smith had simply come down there in order to pursue\nsome scientific research in peace and quiet.  The plate was up as an\naddress rather than as an invitation to patients.  Of course, that must\nbe the true explanation.  In that case the presence of this brilliant\nneighbour would be a splendid thing for his own studies.  He had often\nlonged for some kindred mind, some steel on which he might strike his\nflint.  Chance had brought it to him, and he rejoiced exceedingly.\n\nAnd this joy it was which led him to take a step which was quite at\nvariance with his usual habits.  It is the custom for a new-comer among\nmedical men to call first upon the older, and the etiquette upon the\nsubject is strict.  Dr. Ripley was pedantically exact on such points,\nand yet he deliberately drove over next day and called upon Dr.\nVerrinder Smith.  Such a waiving of ceremony was, he felt, a gracious\nact upon his part, and a fit prelude to the intimate relations which he\nhoped to establish with his neighbour.\n\nThe house was neat and well appointed, and Dr. Ripley was shown by a\nsmart maid into a dapper little consulting room.  As he passed in he\nnoticed two or three parasols and a lady's sun bonnet hanging in the\nhall.  It was a pity that his colleague should be a married man.  It\nwould put them upon a different footing, and interfere with those long\nevenings of high scientific talk which he had pictured to himself.  On\nthe other hand, there was much in the consulting room to please him.\nElaborate instruments, seen more often in hospitals than in the houses\nof private practitioners, were scattered about.  A sphygmograph stood\nupon the table and a gasometer-like engine, which was new to Dr.\nRipley, in the corner.  A book-case full of ponderous volumes in French\nand German, paper-covered for the most part, and varying in tint from\nthe shell to the yoke of a duck's egg, caught his wandering eyes, and\nhe was deeply absorbed in their titles when the door opened suddenly\nbehind him.  Turning round, he found himself facing a little woman,\nwhose plain, palish face was remarkable only for a pair of shrewd,\nhumorous eyes of a blue which had two shades too much green in it.  She\nheld a pince-nez in her left hand, and the doctor's card in her right.\n\n\"How do you do, Dr. Ripley?\" said she.\n\n\"How do you do, madam?\" returned the visitor.  \"Your husband is perhaps\nout?\"\n\n\"I am not married,\" said she simply.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon!  I meant the doctor--Dr. Verrinder Smith.\"\n\n\"I am Dr. Verrinder Smith.\"\n\nDr. Ripley was so surprised that he dropped his hat and forgot to pick\nit up again.\n\n\"What!\" he grasped, \"the Lee Hopkins prizeman!  You!\"\n\nHe had never seen a woman doctor before, and his whole conservative\nsoul rose up in revolt at the idea.  He could not recall any Biblical\ninjunction that the man should remain ever the doctor and the woman the\nnurse, and yet he felt as if a blasphemy had been committed.  His face\nbetrayed his feelings only too clearly.\n\n\"I am sorry to disappoint you,\" said the lady drily.\n\n\"You certainly have surprised me,\" he answered, picking up his hat.\n\n\"You are not among our champions, then?\"\n\n\"I cannot say that the movement has my approval.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"I should much prefer not to discuss it.\"\n\n\"But I am sure you will answer a lady's question.\"\n\n\"Ladies are in danger of losing their privileges when they usurp the\nplace of the other sex.  They cannot claim both.\"\n\n\"Why should a woman not earn her bread by her brains?\"\n\nDr. Ripley felt irritated by the quiet manner in which the lady\ncross-questioned him.\n\n\"I should much prefer not to be led into a discussion, Miss Smith.\"\n\n\"Dr. Smith,\" she interrupted.\n\n\"Well, Dr. Smith!  But if you insist upon an answer, I must say that I\ndo not think medicine a suitable profession for women and that I have a\npersonal objection to masculine ladies.\"\n\nIt was an exceedingly rude speech, and he was ashamed of it the instant\nafter he had made it.  The lady, however, simply raised her eyebrows\nand smiled.\n\n\"It seems to me that you are begging the question,\" said she.  \"Of\ncourse, if it makes women masculine that WOULD be a considerable\ndeterioration.\"\n\nIt was a neat little counter, and Dr. Ripley, like a pinked fencer,\nbowed his acknowledgment.\n\n\"I must go,\" said he.\n\n\"I am sorry that we cannot come to some more friendly conclusion since\nwe are to be neighbours,\" she remarked.\n\nHe bowed again, and took a step towards the door.\n\n\"It was a singular coincidence,\" she continued, \"that at the instant\nthat you called I was reading your paper on 'Locomotor Ataxia,' in the\nLancet.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said he drily.\n\n\"I thought it was a very able monograph.\"\n\n\"You are very good.\"\n\n\"But the views which you attribute to Professor Pitres, of Bordeaux,\nhave been repudiated by him.\"\n\n\"I have his pamphlet of 1890,\" said Dr. Ripley angrily.\n\n\"Here is his pamphlet of 1891.\" She picked it from among a litter of\nperiodicals.  \"If you have time to glance your eye down this\npassage----\"\n\nDr. Ripley took it from her and shot rapidly through the paragraph\nwhich she indicated.  There was no denying that it completely knocked\nthe bottom out of his own article.  He threw it down, and with another\nfrigid bow he made for the door.  As he took the reins from the groom\nhe glanced round and saw that the lady was standing at her window, and\nit seemed to him that she was laughing heartily.\n\nAll day the memory of this interview haunted him.  He felt that he had\ncome very badly out of it.  She had showed herself to be his superior\non his own pet subject.  She had been courteous while he had been rude,\nself-possessed when he had been angry.  And then, above all, there was\nher presence, her monstrous intrusion to rankle in his mind.  A woman\ndoctor had been an abstract thing before, repugnant but distant.  Now\nshe was there in actual practice, with a brass plate up just like his\nown, competing for the same patients.  Not that he feared competition,\nbut he objected to this lowering of his ideal of womanhood.  She could\nnot be more than thirty, and had a bright, mobile face, too.  He\nthought of her humorous eyes, and of her strong, well-turned chin.  It\nrevolted him the more to recall the details of her education.  A man,\nof course, could come through such an ordeal with all his purity, but\nit was nothing short of shameless in a woman.\n\nBut it was not long before he learned that even her competition was a\nthing to be feared.  The novelty of her presence had brought a few\ncurious invalids into her consulting rooms, and, once there, they had\nbeen so impressed by the firmness of her manner and by the singular,\nnew-fashioned instruments with which she tapped, and peered, and\nsounded, that it formed the core of their conversation for weeks\nafterwards.  And soon there were tangible proofs of her powers upon the\ncountry side.  Farmer Eyton, whose callous ulcer had been quietly\nspreading over his shin for years back under a gentle regime of zinc\nointment, was painted round with blistering fluid, and found, after\nthree blasphemous nights, that his sore was stimulated into healing.\nMrs. Crowder, who had always regarded the birthmark upon her second\ndaughter Eliza as a sign of the indignation of the Creator at a third\nhelping of raspberry tart which she had partaken of during a critical\nperiod, learned that, with the help of two galvanic needles, the\nmischief was not irreparable.  In a month Dr. Verrinder Smith was\nknown, and in two she was famous.\n\nOccasionally, Dr. Ripley met her as he drove upon his rounds.  She had\nstarted a high dogcart, taking the reins herself, with a little tiger\nbehind.  When they met he invariably raised his hat with punctilious\npoliteness, but the grim severity of his face showed how formal was the\ncourtesy.  In fact, his dislike was rapidly deepening into absolute\ndetestation.  \"The unsexed woman,\" was the description of her which he\npermitted himself to give to those of his patients who still remained\nstaunch.  But, indeed, they were a rapidly-decreasing body, and every\nday his pride was galled by the news of some fresh defection.  The lady\nhad somehow impressed the country folk with almost superstitious belief\nin her power, and from far and near they flocked to her consulting room.\n\nBut what galled him most of all was, when she did something which he\nhad pronounced to be impracticable.  For all his knowledge he lacked\nnerve as an operator, and usually sent his worst cases up to London.\nThe lady, however, had no weakness of the sort, and took everything\nthat came in her way.  It was agony to him to hear that she was about\nto straighten little Alec Turner's club foot, and right at the fringe\nof the rumour came a note from his mother, the rector's wife, asking\nhim if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist.  It would be\ninhumanity to refuse, as there was no other who could take the place,\nbut it was gall and wormwood to his sensitive nature.  Yet, in spite of\nhis vexation, he could not but admire the dexterity with which the\nthing was done.  She handled the little wax-like foot so gently, and\nheld the tiny tenotomy knife as an artist holds his pencil.  One\nstraight insertion, one snick of a tendon, and it was all over without\na stain upon the white towel which lay beneath.  He had never seen\nanything more masterly, and he had the honesty to say so, though her\nskill increased his dislike of her.  The operation spread her fame\nstill further at his expense, and self-preservation was added to his\nother grounds for detesting her.  And this very detestation it was\nwhich brought matters to a curious climax.\n\nOne winter's night, just as he was rising from his lonely dinner, a\ngroom came riding down from Squire Faircastle's, the richest man in the\ndistrict, to say that his daughter had scalded her hand, and that\nmedical help was needed on the instant.  The coachman had ridden for\nthe lady doctor, for it mattered nothing to the Squire who came as long\nas it were speedily.  Dr. Ripley rushed from his surgery with the\ndetermination that she should not effect an entrance into this\nstronghold of his if hard driving on his part could prevent it.  He did\nnot even wait to light his lamps, but sprang into his gig and flew off\nas fast as hoof could rattle.  He lived rather nearer to the Squire's\nthan she did, and was convinced that he could get there well before her.\n\nAnd so he would but for that whimsical element of chance, which will\nfor ever muddle up the affairs of this world and dumbfound the\nprophets.  Whether it came from the want of his lights, or from his\nmind being full of the thoughts of his rival, he allowed too little by\nhalf a foot in taking the sharp turn upon the Basingstoke road.  The\nempty trap and the frightened horse clattered away into the darkness,\nwhile the Squire's groom crawled out of the ditch into which he had\nbeen shot.  He struck a match, looked down at his groaning companion,\nand then, after the fashion of rough, strong men when they see what\nthey have not seen before, he was very sick.\n\nThe doctor raised himself a little on his elbow in the glint of the\nmatch.  He caught a glimpse of something white and sharp bristling\nthrough his trouser leg half way down the shin.\n\n\"Compound!\" he groaned.  \"A three months' job,\" and fainted.\n\nWhen he came to himself the groom was gone, for he had scudded off to\nthe Squire's house for help, but a small page was holding a gig-lamp in\nfront of his injured leg, and a woman, with an open case of polished\ninstruments gleaming in the yellow light, was deftly slitting up his\ntrouser with a crooked pair of scissors.\n\n\"It's all right, doctor,\" said she soothingly.  \"I am so sorry about\nit.  You can have Dr. Horton to-morrow, but I am sure you will allow me\nto help you to-night.  I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw you by\nthe roadside.\"\n\n\"The groom has gone for help,\" groaned the sufferer.\n\n\"When it comes we can move you into the gig.  A little more light,\nJohn!  So!  Ah, dear, dear, we shall have laceration unless we reduce\nthis before we move you.  Allow me to give you a whiff of chloroform,\nand I have no doubt that I can secure it sufficiently to----\"\n\nDr. Ripley never heard the end of that sentence.  He tried to raise a\nhand and to murmur something in protest, but a sweet smell was in his\nnostrils, and a sense of rich peace and lethargy stole over his jangled\nnerves.  Down he sank, through clear, cool water, ever down and down\ninto the green shadows beneath, gently, without effort, while the\npleasant chiming of a great belfry rose and fell in his ears.  Then he\nrose again, up and up, and ever up, with a terrible tightness about his\ntemples, until at last he shot out of those green shadows and was in\nthe light once more.  Two bright, shining, golden spots gleamed before\nhis dazed eyes.  He blinked and blinked before he could give a name to\nthem.  They were only the two brass balls at the end posts of his bed,\nand he was lying in his own little room, with a head like a cannon\nball, and a leg like an iron bar.  Turning his eyes, he saw the calm\nface of Dr. Verrinder Smith looking down at him.\n\n\"Ah, at last!\" said she.  \"I kept you under all the way home, for I\nknew how painful the jolting would be.  It is in good position now with\na strong side splint.  I have ordered a morphia draught for you.  Shall\nI tell your groom to ride for Dr. Horton in the morning?\"\n\n\"I should prefer that you should continue the case,\" said Dr. Ripley\nfeebly, and then, with a half hysterical laugh,--\"You have all the rest\nof the parish as patients, you know, so you may as well make the thing\ncomplete by having me also.\"\n\nIt was not a very gracious speech, but it was a look of pity and not of\nanger which shone in her eyes as she turned away from his bedside.\n\nDr. Ripley had a brother, William, who was assistant surgeon at a\nLondon hospital, and who was down in Hampshire within a few hours of\nhis hearing of the accident.  He raised his brows when he heard the\ndetails.\n\n\"What! You are pestered with one of those!\" he cried.\n\n\"I don't know what I should have done without her.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt she's an excellent nurse.\"\n\n\"She knows her work as well as you or I.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, James,\" said the London man with a sniff.  \"But\napart from that, you know that the principle of the thing is all wrong.\"\n\n\"You think there is nothing to be said on the other side?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! do you?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know.  It struck me during the night that we may have\nbeen a little narrow in our views.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, James.  It's all very fine for women to win prizes in the\nlecture room, but you know as well as I do that they are no use in an\nemergency.  Now I warrant that this woman was all nerves when she was\nsetting your leg.  That reminds me that I had better just take a look\nat it and see that it is all right.\"\n\n\"I would rather that you did not undo it,\" said the patient.  \"I have\nher assurance that it is all right.\"\n\nBrother William was deeply shocked.\n\n\"Of course, if a woman's assurance is of more value than the opinion of\nthe assistant surgeon of a London hospital, there is nothing more to be\nsaid,\" he remarked.\n\n\"I should prefer that you did not touch it,\" said the patient firmly,\nand Dr. William went back to London that evening in a huff.\n\nThe lady, who had heard of his coming, was much surprised on learning\nhis departure.\n\n\"We had a difference upon a point of professional etiquette,\" said Dr.\nJames, and it was all the explanation he would vouchsafe.\n\nFor two long months Dr. Ripley was brought in contact with his rival\nevery day, and he learned many things which he had not known before.\nShe was a charming companion, as well as a most assiduous doctor.  Her\nshort presence during the long, weary day was like a flower in a sand\nwaste.  What interested him was precisely what interested her, and she\ncould meet him at every point upon equal terms.  And yet under all her\nlearning and her firmness ran a sweet, womanly nature, peeping out in\nher talk, shining in her greenish eyes, showing itself in a thousand\nsubtle ways which the dullest of men could read.  And he, though a bit\nof a prig and a pedant, was by no means dull, and had honesty enough to\nconfess when he was in the wrong.\n\n\"I don't know how to apologise to you,\" he said in his shame-faced\nfashion one day, when he had progressed so far as to be able to sit in\nan arm-chair with his leg upon another one; \"I feel that I have been\nquite in the wrong.\"\n\n\"Why, then?\"\n\n\"Over this woman question.  I used to think that a woman must\ninevitably lose something of her charm if she took up such studies.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't think they are necessarily unsexed, then?\" she cried,\nwith a mischievous smile.\n\n\"Please don't recall my idiotic expression.\"\n\n\"I feel so pleased that I should have helped in changing your views.  I\nthink that it is the most sincere compliment that I have ever had paid\nme.\"\n\n\"At any rate, it is the truth,\" said he, and was happy all night at the\nremembrance of the flush of pleasure which made her pale face look\nquite comely for the instant.\n\nFor, indeed, he was already far past the stage when he would\nacknowledge her as the equal of any other woman.  Already he could not\ndisguise from himself that she had become the one woman.  Her dainty\nskill, her gentle touch, her sweet presence, the community of their\ntastes, had all united to hopelessly upset his previous opinions.  It\nwas a dark day for him now when his convalescence allowed her to miss a\nvisit, and darker still that other one which he saw approaching when\nall occasion for her visits would be at an end.  It came round at last,\nhowever, and he felt that his whole life's fortune would hang upon the\nissue of that final interview.  He was a direct man by nature, so he\nlaid his hand upon hers as it felt for his pulse, and he asked her if\nshe would be his wife.\n\n\"What, and unite the practices?\" said she.\n\nHe started in pain and anger.\n\n\"Surely you do not attribute any such base motive to me!\" he cried.  \"I\nlove you as unselfishly as ever a woman was loved.\"\n\n\"No, I was wrong.  It was a foolish speech,\" said she, moving her chair\na little back, and tapping her stethoscope upon her knee.  \"Forget that\nI ever said it.  I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment, and I\nappreciate most highly the honour which you do me, but what you ask is\nquite impossible.\"\n\nWith another woman he might have urged the point, but his instincts\ntold him that it was quite useless with this one.  Her tone of voice\nwas conclusive.  He said nothing, but leaned back in his chair a\nstricken man.\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" she said again.  \"If I had known what was passing in\nyour mind I should have told you earlier that I intended to devote my\nlife entirely to science.  There are many women with a capacity for\nmarriage, but few with a taste for biology.  I will remain true to my\nown line, then.  I came down here while waiting for an opening in the\nParis Physiological Laboratory.  I have just heard that there is a\nvacancy for me there, and so you will be troubled no more by my\nintrusion upon your practice.  I have done you an injustice just as you\ndid me one.  I thought you narrow and pedantic, with no good quality.\nI have learned during your illness to appreciate you better, and the\nrecollection of our friendship will always be a very pleasant one to\nme.\"\n\nAnd so it came about that in a very few weeks there was only one doctor\nin Hoyland.  But folks noticed that the one had aged many years in a\nfew months, that a weary sadness lurked always in the depths of his\nblue eyes, and that he was less concerned than ever with the eligible\nyoung ladies whom chance, or their careful country mammas, placed in\nhis way.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SURGEON TALKS.\n\n\"Men die of the diseases which they have studied most,\" remarked the\nsurgeon, snipping off the end of a cigar with all his professional\nneatness and finish.  \"It's as if the morbid condition was an evil\ncreature which, when it found itself closely hunted, flew at the throat\nof its pursuer.  If you worry the microbes too much they may worry you.\nI've seen cases of it, and not necessarily in microbic diseases either.\nThere was, of course, the well-known instance of Liston and the\naneurism; and a dozen others that I could mention.  You couldn't have a\nclearer case than that of poor old Walker of St.  Christopher's.  Not\nheard of it?  Well, of course, it was a little before your time, but I\nwonder that it should have been forgotten.  You youngsters are so busy\nin keeping up to the day that you lose a good deal that is interesting\nof yesterday.\n\n\"Walker was one of the best men in Europe on nervous disease.  You must\nhave read his little book on sclerosis of the posterior columns.  It's\nas interesting as a novel, and epoch-making in its way.  He worked like\na horse, did Walker--huge consulting practice--hours a day in the\nclinical wards--constant original investigations.  And then he enjoyed\nhimself also.  'De mortuis,' of course, but still it's an open secret\namong all who knew him.  If he died at forty-five, he crammed eighty\nyears into it.  The marvel was that he could have held on so long at\nthe pace at which he was going.  But he took it beautifully when it\ncame.\n\n\"I was his clinical assistant at the time.  Walker was lecturing on\nlocomotor ataxia to a wardful of youngsters.  He was explaining that\none of the early signs of the complaint was that the patient could not\nput his heels together with his eyes shut without staggering.  As he\nspoke, he suited the action to the word.  I don't suppose the boys\nnoticed anything.  I did, and so did he, though he finished his lecture\nwithout a sign.\n\n\"When it was over he came into my room and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"'Just run over my reflexes, Smith,' said he.\n\n\"There was hardly a trace of them left.  I tapped away at his\nknee-tendon and might as well have tried to get a jerk out of that\nsofa-cushion.  He stood with his eyes shut again, and he swayed like a\nbush in the wind.\n\n\"'So,' said he, 'it was not intercostal neuralgia after all.'\n\n\"Then I knew that he had had the lightning pains, and that the case was\ncomplete.  There was nothing to say, so I sat looking at him while he\npuffed and puffed at his cigarette.  Here he was, a man in the prime of\nlife, one of the handsomest men in London, with money, fame, social\nsuccess, everything at his feet, and now, without a moment's warning,\nhe was told that inevitable death lay before him, a death accompanied\nby more refined and lingering tortures than if he were bound upon a Red\nIndian stake.  He sat in the middle of the blue cigarette cloud with\nhis eyes cast down, and the slightest little tightening of his lips.\nThen he rose with a motion of his arms, as one who throws off old\nthoughts and enters upon a new course.\n\n\"'Better put this thing straight at once,' said he.  'I must make some\nfresh arrangements.  May I use your paper and envelopes?'\n\n\"He settled himself at my desk and he wrote half a dozen letters.  It\nis not a breach of confidence to say that they were not addressed to\nhis professional brothers.  Walker was a single man, which means that\nhe was not restricted to a single woman.  When he had finished, he\nwalked out of that little room of mine, leaving every hope and ambition\nof his life behind him.  And he might have had another year of\nignorance and peace if it had not been for the chance illustration in\nhis lecture.\n\n\"It took five years to kill him, and he stood it well.  If he had ever\nbeen a little irregular he atoned for it in that long martyrdom.  He\nkept an admirable record of his own symptoms, and worked out the eye\nchanges more fully than has ever been done.  When the ptosis got very\nbad he would hold his eyelid up with one hand while he wrote.  Then,\nwhen he could not co-ordinate his muscles to write, he dictated to his\nnurse.  So died, in the odour of science, James Walker, aet. 45.\n\n\"Poor old Walker was very fond of experimental surgery, and he broke\nground in several directions.  Between ourselves, there may have been\nsome more ground-breaking afterwards, but he did his best for his\ncases.  You know M'Namara, don't you?  He always wears his hair long.\nHe lets it be understood that it comes from his artistic strain, but it\nis really to conceal the loss of one of his ears.  Walker cut the other\none off, but you must not tell Mac I said so.\n\n\"It was like this.  Walker had a fad about the portio dura--the motor\nto the face, you know--and he thought paralysis of it came from a\ndisturbance of the blood supply.  Something else which counterbalanced\nthat disturbance might, he thought, set it right again.  We had a very\nobstinate case of Bell's paralysis in the wards, and had tried it with\nevery conceivable thing, blistering, tonics, nerve-stretching,\ngalvanism, needles, but all without result.  Walker got it into his\nhead that removal of the ear would increase the blood supply to the\npart, and he very soon gained the consent of the patient to the\noperation.\n\n\"Well, we did it at night.  Walker, of course, felt that it was\nsomething of an experiment, and did not wish too much talk about it\nunless it proved successful.  There were half-a-dozen of us there,\nM'Namara and I among the rest.  The room was a small one, and in the\ncentre was in the narrow table, with a macintosh over the pillow, and a\nblanket which extended almost to the floor on either side.  Two\ncandles, on a side-table near the pillow, supplied all the light.  In\ncame the patient, with one side of his face as smooth as a baby's, and\nthe other all in a quiver with fright.  He lay down, and the chloroform\ntowel was placed over his face, while Walker threaded his needles in\nthe candle light.  The chloroformist stood at the head of the table,\nand M'Namara was stationed at the side to control the patient.  The\nrest of us stood by to assist.\n\n\"Well, the man was about half over when he fell into one of those\nconvulsive flurries which come with the semi-unconscious stage. He\nkicked and plunged and struck out with both hands.  Over with a crash\nwent the little table which held the candles, and in an instant we were\nleft in total darkness.  You can think what a rush and a scurry there\nwas, one to pick up the table, one to find the matches, and some to\nrestrain the patient who was still dashing himself about.  He was held\ndown by two dressers, the chloroform was pushed, and by the time the\ncandles were relit, his incoherent, half-smothered shoutings had\nchanged to a stertorous snore.   His head was turned on the pillow and\nthe towel was still kept over his face while the operation was carried\nthrough.  Then the towel was withdrawn, and you can conceive our\namazement when we looked upon the face of M'Namara.\n\n\"How did it happen?  Why, simply enough.  As the candles went over, the\nchloroformist had stopped for an instant and had tried to catch them.\nThe patient, just as the light went out, had rolled off and under the\ntable.  Poor M'Namara, clinging frantically to him, had been dragged\nacross it, and the chloroformist, feeling him there, had naturally\nclaped the towel across his mouth and nose.  The others had secured\nhim, and the more he roared and kicked the more they drenched him with\nchloroform.  Walker was very nice about it, and made the most handsome\napologies.  He offered to do a plastic on the spot, and make as good an\near as he could, but M'Namara had had enough of it.  As to the patient,\nwe found him sleeping placidly under the table, with the ends of the\nblanket screening him on both sides.  Walker sent M'Namara round his\near next day in a jar of methylated spirit, but Mac's wife was very\nangry about it, and it led to a good deal of ill-feeling.\n\n\"Some people say that the more one has to do with human nature, and the\ncloser one is brought in contact with it, the less one thinks of it.  I\ndon't believe that those who know most would uphold that view.  My own\nexperience is dead against it.  I was brought up in the\nmiserable-mortal-clay school of theology, and yet here I am, after\nthirty years of intimate acquaintance with humanity, filled with\nrespect for it.  The evil lies commonly upon the surface.  The deeper\nstrata are good.  A hundred times I have seen folk condemned to death\nas suddenly as poor Walker was.  Sometimes it was to blindness or to\nmutilations which are worse than death.  Men and women, they almost all\ntook it beautifully, and some with such lovely unselfishness, and with\nsuch complete absorption in the thought of how their fate would affect\nothers, that the man about town, or the frivolously-dressed woman has\nseemed to change into an angel before my eyes.  I have seen death-beds,\ntoo, of all ages and of all creeds and want of creeds.  I never saw any\nof them shrink, save only one poor, imaginative young fellow, who had\nspent his blameless life in the strictest of sects.  Of course, an\nexhausted frame is incapable of fear, as anyone can vouch who is told,\nin the midst of his sea-sickness, that the ship is going to the bottom.\nThat is why I rate courage in the face of mutilation to be higher than\ncourage when a wasting illness is fining away into death.\n\n\"Now, I'll take a case which I had in my own practice last Wednesday.\nA lady came in to consult me--the wife of a well-known sporting\nbaronet.  The husband had come with her, but remained, at her request,\nin the waiting-room.  I need not go into details, but it proved to be a\npeculiarly malignant case of cancer.  'I knew it,' said she.  'How long\nhave I to live?'  'I fear that it may exhaust your strength in a few\nmonths,' I answered.  'Poor old Jack!' said she.  'I'll tell him that\nit is not dangerous.'  'Why should you deceive him?' I asked.  'Well,\nhe's very uneasy about it, and he is quaking now in the waiting-room.\nHe has two old friends to dinner to-night, and I haven't the heart to\nspoil his evening.  To-morrow will be time enough for him to learn the\ntruth.'  Out she walked, the brave little woman, and a moment later her\nhusband, with his big, red face shining with joy came plunging into my\nroom to shake me by the hand.  No, I respected her wish and I did not\nundeceive him.  I dare bet that evening was one of the brightest, and\nthe next morning the darkest, of his life.\n\n\"It's wonderful how bravely and cheerily a woman can face a crushing\nblow.  It is different with men.  A man can stand it without\ncomplaining, but it knocks him dazed and silly all the same.  But the\nwoman does not lose her wits any more than she does her courage.  Now,\nI had a case only a few weeks ago which would show you what I mean.  A\ngentleman consulted me about his wife, a very beautiful woman.  She had\na small tubercular nodule upon her upper arm, according to him.  He was\nsure that it was of no importance, but he wanted to know whether\nDevonshire or the Riviera would be the better for her. I examined her\nand found a frightful sarcoma of the bone, hardly showing upon the\nsurface, but involving the shoulder-blade and clavicle as well as the\nhumerus.  A more malignant case I have never seen.  I sent her out of\nthe room and I told him the truth.  What did he do?  Why, he walked\nslowly round that room with his hands behind his back, looking with the\ngreatest interest at the pictures.  I can see him now, putting up his\ngold pince-nez and staring at them with perfectly vacant eyes, which\ntold me that he saw neither them nor the wall behind them.  'Amputation\nof the arm?' he asked at last.  'And of the collar-bone and\nshoulder-blade,' said I.  'Quite so.  The collar-bone and\nshoulder-blade,' he repeated, still staring about him with those\nlifeless eyes.  It settled him.  I don't believe he'll ever be the same\nman again.  But the woman took it as bravely and brightly as could be,\nand she has done very well since.   The mischief was so great that the\narm snapped as we drew it from the night-dress.  No, I don't think that\nthere will be any return, and I have every hope of her recovery.\n\n\"The first patient is a thing which one remembers all one's life.  Mine\nwas commonplace, and the details are of no interest.  I had a curious\nvisitor, however, during the first few months after my plate went up.\nIt was an elderly woman, richly dressed, with a wickerwork picnic\nbasket in her hand.  This she opened with the tears streaming down her\nface, and out there waddled the fattest, ugliest, and mangiest little\npug dog that I have ever seen.  'I wish you to put him painlessly out\nof the world, doctor,' she cried.  'Quick, quick, or my resolution may\ngive way.'  She flung herself down, with hysterical sobs, upon the\nsofa.  The less experienced a doctor is, the higher are his notions of\nprofessional dignity, as I need not remind you, my young friend, so I\nwas about to refuse the commission with indignation, when I bethought\nme that, quite apart from medicine, we were gentleman and lady, and\nthat she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of\nthe greatest possible importance in her eyes.  I led off the poor\nlittle doggie, therefore, and with the help of a saucerful of milk and\na few drops of prussic acid his exit was as speedy and painless as\ncould be desired.  'Is it over?' she cried as I entered.  It was really\ntragic to see how all the love which should have gone to husband and\nchildren had, in default of them, been centred upon this uncouth little\nanimal.  She left, quite broken down, in her carriage, and it was only\nafter her departure that I saw an envelope sealed with a large red\nseal, and lying upon the blotting pad of my desk.  Outside, in pencil,\nwas written:  'I have no doubt that you would willingly have done this\nwithout a fee, but I insist upon your acceptance of the enclosed.'  I\nopened it with some vague notions of an eccentric millionaire and a\nfifty-pound note, but all I found was a postal order for four and\nsixpence.  The whole incident struck me as so whimsical that I laughed\nuntil I was tired.  You'll find there's so much tragedy in a doctor's\nlife, my boy, that he would not be able to stand it if it were not for\nthe strain of comedy which comes every now and then to leaven it.\n\n\"And a doctor has very much to be thankful for also.  Don't you ever\nforget it.  It is such a pleasure to do a little good that a man should\npay for the privilege instead of being paid for it.  Still, of course,\nhe has his home to keep up and his wife and children to support.  But\nhis patients are his friends--or they should be so.  He goes from house\nto house, and his step and his voice are loved and welcomed in each.\nWhat could a man ask for more than that?  And besides, he is forced to\nbe a good man.  It is impossible for him to be anything else.  How can\na man spend his whole life in seeing suffering bravely borne and yet\nremain a hard or a vicious man?  It is a noble, generous, kindly\nprofession, and you youngsters have got to see that it remains so.\""
