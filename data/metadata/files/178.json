 "text": "CONFIDENCE\n\nby Henry James\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIt was in the early days of April; Bernard Longueville had been spending\nthe winter in Rome. He had travelled northward with the consciousness of\nseveral social duties that appealed to him from the further side of the\nAlps, but he was under the charm of the Italian spring, and he made a\npretext for lingering. He had spent five days at Siena, where he had\nintended to spend but two, and still it was impossible to continue his\njourney. He was a young man of a contemplative and speculative turn, and\nthis was his first visit to Italy, so that if he dallied by the way he\nshould not be harshly judged. He had a fancy for sketching, and it was\non his conscience to take a few pictorial notes. There were two old\ninns at Siena, both of them very shabby and very dirty. The one at which\nLongueville had taken up his abode was entered by a dark, pestiferous\narch-way, surmounted by a sign which at a distance might have been read\nby the travellers as the Dantean injunction to renounce all hope. The\nother was not far off, and the day after his arrival, as he passed\nit, he saw two ladies going in who evidently belonged to the large\nfraternity of Anglo-Saxon tourists, and one of whom was young and\ncarried herself very well. Longueville had his share--or more than his\nshare--of gallantry, and this incident awakened a regret. If he had\ngone to the other inn he might have had charming company: at his own\nestablishment there was no one but an aesthetic German who smoked bad\ntobacco in the dining-room. He remarked to himself that this was always\nhis luck, and the remark was characteristic of the man; it was charged\nwith the feeling of the moment, but it was not absolutely just; it was\nthe result of an acute impression made by the particular occasion;\nbut it failed in appreciation of a providence which had sprinkled\nLongueville’s career with happy accidents--accidents, especially, in\nwhich his characteristic gallantry was not allowed to rust for want of\nexercise. He lounged, however, contentedly enough through these bright,\nstill days of a Tuscan April, drawing much entertainment from the high\npicturesqueness of the things about him. Siena, a few years since, was\na flawless gift of the Middle Ages to the modern imagination. No other\nItalian city could have been more interesting to an observer fond\nof reconstructing obsolete manners. This was a taste of Bernard\nLongueville’s, who had a relish for serious literature, and at one time\nhad made several lively excursions into mediaeval history. His friends\nthought him very clever, and at the same time had an easy feeling about\nhim which was a tribute to his freedom from pedantry. He was clever\nindeed, and an excellent companion; but the real measure of his\nbrilliancy was in the success with which he entertained himself. He was\nmuch addicted to conversing with his own wit, and he greatly enjoyed his\nown society. Clever as he often was in talking with his friends, I am\nnot sure that his best things, as the phrase is, were not for his\nown ears. And this was not on account of any cynical contempt for the\nunderstanding of his fellow-creatures: it was simply because what I have\ncalled his own society was more of a stimulus than that of most other\npeople. And yet he was not for this reason fond of solitude; he was, on\nthe contrary, a very sociable animal. It must be admitted at the outset\nthat he had a nature which seemed at several points to contradict\nitself, as will probably be perceived in the course of this narration.\n\nHe entertained himself greatly with his reflections and meditations upon\nSienese architecture and early Tuscan art, upon Italian street-life and\nthe geological idiosyncrasies of the Apennines. If he had only gone to\nthe other inn, that nice-looking girl whom he had seen passing under the\ndusky portal with her face turned away from him might have broken bread\nwith him at this intellectual banquet. Then came a day, however, when\nit seemed for a moment that if she were disposed she might gather up the\ncrumbs of the feast. Longueville, every morning after breakfast, took\na turn in the great square of Siena--the vast piazza, shaped like\na horse-shoe, where the market is held beneath the windows of that\ncrenellated palace from whose overhanging cornice a tall, straight tower\nsprings up with a movement as light as that of a single plume in the\nbonnet of a captain. Here he strolled about, watching a brown contadino\ndisembarrass his donkey, noting the progress of half an hour’s chaffer\nover a bundle of carrots, wishing a young girl with eyes like animated\nagates would let him sketch her, and gazing up at intervals at the\nbeautiful, slim tower, as it played at contrasts with the large blue\nair. After he had spent the greater part of a week in these grave\nconsiderations, he made up his mind to leave Siena. But he was not\ncontent with what he had done for his portfolio. Siena was eminently\nsketchable, but he had not been industrious. On the last morning of his\nvisit, as he stood staring about him in the crowded piazza, and feeling\nthat, in spite of its picturesqueness, this was an awkward place for\nsetting up an easel, he bethought himself, by contrast, of a quiet\ncorner in another part of the town, which he had chanced upon in one\nof his first walks--an angle of a lonely terrace that abutted upon the\ncity-wall, where three or four superannuated objects seemed to slumber\nin the sunshine--the open door of an empty church, with a faded fresco\nexposed to the air in the arch above it, and an ancient beggar-woman\nsitting beside it on a three-legged stool. The little terrace had an\nold polished parapet, about as high as a man’s breast, above which was\na view of strange, sad-colored hills. Outside, to the left, the wall\nof the town made an outward bend, and exposed its rugged and rusty\ncomplexion. There was a smooth stone bench set into the wall of the\nchurch, on which Longueville had rested for an hour, observing the\ncomposition of the little picture of which I have indicated the\nelements, and of which the parapet of the terrace would form the\nforeground. The thing was what painters call a subject, and he had\npromised himself to come back with his utensils. This morning he\nreturned to the inn and took possession of them, and then he made his\nway through a labyrinth of empty streets, lying on the edge of the town,\nwithin the wall, like the superfluous folds of a garment whose wearer\nhas shrunken with old age. He reached his little grass-grown terrace,\nand found it as sunny and as private as before. The old mendicant was\nmumbling petitions, sacred and profane, at the church door; but save for\nthis the stillness was unbroken. The yellow sunshine warmed the brown\nsurface of the city-wall, and lighted the hollows of the Etruscan hills.\nLongueville settled himself on the empty bench, and, arranging his\nlittle portable apparatus, began to ply his brushes. He worked for some\ntime smoothly and rapidly, with an agreeable sense of the absence of\nobstacles. It seemed almost an interruption when, in the silent air, he\nheard a distant bell in the town strike noon. Shortly after this, there\nwas another interruption. The sound of a soft footstep caused him to\nlook up; whereupon he saw a young woman standing there and bending her\neyes upon the graceful artist. A second glance assured him that she\nwas that nice girl whom he had seen going into the other inn with her\nmother, and suggested that she had just emerged from the little church.\nHe suspected, however--I hardly know why--that she had been looking\nat him for some moments before he perceived her. It would perhaps be\nimpertinent to inquire what she thought of him; but Longueville, in the\nspace of an instant, made two or three reflections upon the young lady.\nOne of them was to the effect that she was a handsome creature, but\nthat she looked rather bold; the burden of the other was that--yes,\ndecidedly--she was a compatriot. She turned away almost as soon as she\nmet his eyes; he had hardly time to raise his hat, as, after a moment’s\nhesitation, he proceeded to do. She herself appeared to feel a certain\nhesitation; she glanced back at the church door, as if under the impulse\nto retrace her steps. She stood there a moment longer--long enough to\nlet him see that she was a person of easy attitudes--and then she walked\naway slowly to the parapet of the terrace. Here she stationed herself,\nleaning her arms upon the high stone ledge, presenting her back to\nLongueville, and gazing at rural Italy. Longueville went on with his\nsketch, but less attentively than before. He wondered what this young\nlady was doing there alone, and then it occurred to him that her\ncompanion--her mother, presumably--was in the church. The two ladies had\nbeen in the church when he arrived; women liked to sit in churches; they\nhad been there more than half an hour, and the mother had not enough of\nit even yet. The young lady, however, at present preferred the view that\nLongueville was painting; he became aware that she had placed herself in\nthe very centre of his foreground. His first feeling was that she would\nspoil it; his second was that she would improve it. Little by little she\nturned more into profile, leaning only one arm upon the parapet, while\nthe other hand, holding her folded parasol, hung down at her side. She\nwas motionless; it was almost as if she were standing there on purpose\nto be drawn. Yes, certainly she improved the picture. Her profile,\ndelicate and thin, defined itself against the sky, in the clear shadow\nof a coquettish hat; her figure was light; she bent and leaned easily;\nshe wore a gray dress, fastened up as was then the fashion, and\ndisplaying the broad edge of a crimson petticoat. She kept her position;\nshe seemed absorbed in the view. “Is she posing--is she attitudinizing\nfor my benefit?” Longueville asked of himself. And then it seemed to\nhim that this was a needless assumption, for the prospect was quite\nbeautiful enough to be looked at for itself, and there was nothing\nimpossible in a pretty girl having a love of fine landscape. “But posing\nor not,” he went on, “I will put her into my sketch. She has simply\nput herself in. It will give it a human interest. There is nothing like\nhaving a human interest.” So, with the ready skill that he possessed, he\nintroduced the young girl’s figure into his foreground, and at the\nend of ten minutes he had almost made something that had the form of a\nlikeness. “If she will only be quiet for another ten minutes,” he said,\n“the thing will really be a picture.” Unfortunately, the young lady was\nnot quiet; she had apparently had enough of her attitude and her view.\nShe turned away, facing Longueville again, and slowly came back, as if\nto re-enter the church. To do so she had to pass near him, and as she\napproached he instinctively got up, holding his drawing in one hand.\nShe looked at him again, with that expression that he had mentally\ncharacterized as “bold,” a few minutes before--with dark, intelligent\neyes. Her hair was dark and dense; she was a strikingly handsome girl.\n\n“I am so sorry you moved,” he said, confidently, in English. “You were\nso--so beautiful.”\n\nShe stopped, looking at him more directly than ever; and she looked at\nhis sketch, which he held out toward her. At the sketch, however, she\nonly glanced, whereas there was observation in the eye that she bent\nupon Longueville. He never knew whether she had blushed; he afterward\nthought she might have been frightened. Nevertheless, it was not exactly\nterror that appeared to dictate her answer to Longueville’s speech.\n\n“I am much obliged to you. Don’t you think you have looked at me\nenough?”\n\n“By no means. I should like so much to finish my drawing.”\n\n“I am not a professional model,” said the young lady.\n\n“No. That ‘s my difficulty,” Longueville answered, laughing. “I can’t\npropose to remunerate you.”\n\nThe young lady seemed to think this joke in indifferent taste. She\nturned away in silence; but something in her expression, in his feeling\nat the time, in the situation, incited Longueville to higher play. He\nfelt a lively need of carrying his point.\n\n“You see it will be pure kindness,” he went on,--“a simple act of\ncharity. Five minutes will be enough. Treat me as an Italian beggar.”\n\nShe had laid down his sketch and had stepped forward. He stood there,\nobsequious, clasping his hands and smiling.\n\nHis interruptress stopped and looked at him again, as if she thought him\na very odd person; but she seemed amused. Now, at any rate, she was not\nfrightened. She seemed even disposed to provoke him a little.\n\n“I wish to go to my mother,” she said.\n\n“Where is your mother?” the young man asked.\n\n“In the church, of course. I did n’t come here alone!”\n\n“Of course not; but you may be sure that your mother is very contented.\nI have been in that little church. It is charming. She is just resting\nthere; she is probably tired. If you will kindly give me five minutes\nmore, she will come out to you.”\n\n“Five minutes?” the young girl asked.\n\n“Five minutes will do. I shall be eternally grateful.” Longueville was\namused at himself as he said this. He cared infinitely less for his\nsketch than the words appeared to imply; but, somehow, he cared greatly\nthat this graceful stranger should do what he had proposed.\n\nThe graceful stranger dropped an eye on the sketch again.\n\n“Is your picture so good as that?” she asked.\n\n“I have a great deal of talent,” he answered, laughing. “You shall see\nfor yourself, when it is finished.”\n\nShe turned slowly toward the terrace again.\n\n“You certainly have a great deal of talent, to induce me to do what you\nask.” And she walked to where she had stood before. Longueville made a\nmovement to go with her, as if to show her the attitude he meant; but,\npointing with decision to his easel, she said--\n\n“You have only five minutes.” He immediately went back to his work, and\nshe made a vague attempt to take up her position. “You must tell me if\nthis will do,” she added, in a moment.\n\n“It will do beautifully,” Longueville answered, in a happy tone, looking\nat her and plying his brush. “It is immensely good of you to take so\nmuch trouble.”\n\nFor a moment she made no rejoinder, but presently she said--\n\n“Of course if I pose at all I wish to pose well.”\n\n“You pose admirably,” said Longueville.\n\nAfter this she said nothing, and for several minutes he painted rapidly\nand in silence. He felt a certain excitement, and the movement of his\nthoughts kept pace with that of his brush. It was very true that she\nposed admirably; she was a fine creature to paint. Her prettiness\ninspired him, and also her audacity, as he was content to regard it\nfor the moment. He wondered about her--who she was, and what she\nwas--perceiving that the so-called audacity was not vulgar boldness,\nbut the play of an original and probably interesting character. It was\nobvious that she was a perfect lady, but it was equally obvious that\nshe was irregularly clever. Longueville’s little figure was a success--a\ncharming success, he thought, as he put on the last touches. While he\nwas doing this, his model’s companion came into view. She came out of\nthe church, pausing a moment as she looked from her daughter to the\nyoung man in the corner of the terrace; then she walked straight over\nto the young girl. She was a delicate little gentlewoman, with a light,\nquick step.\n\nLongueville’s five minutes were up; so, leaving his place, he approached\nthe two ladies, sketch in hand. The elder one, who had passed her hand\ninto her daughter’s arm, looked up at him with clear, surprised eyes;\nshe was a charming old woman. Her eyes were very pretty, and on either\nside of them, above a pair of fine dark brows, was a band of silvery\nhair, rather coquettishly arranged.\n\n“It is my portrait,” said her daughter, as Longueville drew near. “This\ngentleman has been sketching me.”\n\n“Sketching you, dearest?” murmured her mother. “Was n’t it rather\nsudden?”\n\n“Very sudden--very abrupt!” exclaimed the young girl with a laugh.\n\n“Considering all that, it ‘s very good,” said Longueville, offering his\npicture to the elder lady, who took it and began to examine it. “I can’t\ntell you how much I thank you,” he said to his model.\n\n“It ‘s very well for you to thank me now,” she replied. “You really had\nno right to begin.”\n\n“The temptation was so great.”\n\n“We should resist temptation. And you should have asked my leave.”\n\n“I was afraid you would refuse it; and you stood there, just in my line\nof vision.”\n\n“You should have asked me to get out of it.”\n\n“I should have been very sorry. Besides, it would have been extremely\nrude.”\n\nThe young girl looked at him a moment.\n\n“Yes, I think it would. But what you have done is ruder.”\n\n“It is a hard case!” said Longueville. “What could I have done, then,\ndecently?”\n\n“It ‘s a beautiful drawing,” murmured the elder lady, handing the thing\nback to Longueville. Her daughter, meanwhile, had not even glanced at\nit.\n\n“You might have waited till I should go away,” this argumentative young\nperson continued.\n\nLongueville shook his head.\n\n“I never lose opportunities!”\n\n“You might have sketched me afterwards, from memory.”\n\nLongueville looked at her, smiling.\n\n“Judge how much better my memory will be now!”\n\nShe also smiled a little, but instantly became serious.\n\n“For myself, it ‘s an episode I shall try to forget. I don’t like the\npart I have played in it.”\n\n“May you never play a less becoming one!” cried Longueville. “I hope\nthat your mother, at least, will accept a memento of the occasion.” And\nhe turned again with his sketch to her companion, who had been listening\nto the girl’s conversation with this enterprising stranger, and looking\nfrom one to the other with an air of earnest confusion. “Won’t you do me\nthe honor of keeping my sketch?” he said. “I think it really looks like\nyour daughter.”\n\n“Oh, thank you, thank you; I hardly dare,” murmured the lady, with a\ndeprecating gesture.\n\n“It will serve as a kind of amends for the liberty I have taken,”\n Longueville added; and he began to remove the drawing from its paper\nblock.\n\n“It makes it worse for you to give it to us,” said the young girl.\n\n“Oh, my dear, I am sure it ‘s lovely!” exclaimed her mother. “It ‘s\nwonderfully like you.”\n\n“I think that also makes it worse!”\n\nLongueville was at last nettled. The young lady’s perversity was perhaps\nnot exactly malignant; but it was certainly ungracious. She seemed to\ndesire to present herself as a beautiful tormentress.\n\n“How does it make it worse?” he asked, with a frown.\n\nHe believed she was clever, and she was certainly ready. Now, however,\nshe reflected a moment before answering.\n\n“That you should give us your sketch,” she said at last.\n\n“It was to your mother I offered it,” Longueville observed.\n\nBut this observation, the fruit of his irritation, appeared to have no\neffect upon the young girl.\n\n“Is n’t it what painters call a study?” she went on. “A study is of use\nto the painter himself. Your justification would be that you should keep\nyour sketch, and that it might be of use to you.”\n\n“My daughter is a study, sir, you will say,” said the elder lady in a\nlittle, light, conciliating voice, and graciously accepting the drawing\nagain.\n\n“I will admit,” said Longueville, “that I am very inconsistent. Set it\ndown to my esteem, madam,” he added, looking at the mother.\n\n“That ‘s for you, mamma,” said his model, disengaging her arm from her\nmother’s hand and turning away.\n\nThe mamma stood looking at the sketch with a smile which seemed to\nexpress a tender desire to reconcile all accidents.\n\n“It ‘s extremely beautiful,” she murmured, “and if you insist on my\ntaking it--”\n\n“I shall regard it as a great honor.”\n\n“Very well, then; with many thanks, I will keep it.” She looked at the\nyoung man a moment, while her daughter walked away. Longueville thought\nher a delightful little person; she struck him as a sort of transfigured\nQuakeress--a mystic with a practical side. “I am sure you think she ‘s a\nstrange girl,” she said.\n\n“She is extremely pretty.”\n\n“She is very clever,” said the mother.\n\n“She is wonderfully graceful.”\n\n“Ah, but she ‘s good!” cried the old lady.\n\n“I am sure she comes honestly by that,” said Longueville, expressively,\nwhile his companion, returning his salutation with a certain scrupulous\ngrace of her own, hurried after her daughter.\n\nLongueville remained there staring at the view but not especially seeing\nit. He felt as if he had at once enjoyed and lost an opportunity. After\na while he tried to make a sketch of the old beggar-woman who sat there\nin a sort of palsied immobility, like a rickety statue at a church-door.\nBut his attempt to reproduce her features was not gratifying, and he\nsuddenly laid down his brush. She was not pretty enough--she had a bad\nprofile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTwo months later Bernard Longueville was at Venice, still under the\nimpression that he was leaving Italy. He was not a man who made plans\nand held to them. He made them, indeed--few men made more--but he\nmade them as a basis for variation. He had gone to Venice to spend a\nfortnight, and his fortnight had taken the form of eight enchanting\nweeks. He had still a sort of conviction that he was carrying out his\nplans; for it must be confessed that where his pleasure was concerned he\nhad considerable skill in accommodating his theory to his practice. His\nenjoyment of Venice was extreme, but he was roused from it by a summons\nhe was indisposed to resist. This consisted of a letter from an intimate\nfriend who was living in Germany--a friend whose name was Gordon Wright.\nHe had been spending the winter in Dresden, but his letter bore the date\nof Baden-Baden. As it was not long, I may give it entire.\n\n“I wish very much that you would come to this place. I think you have\nbeen here before, so that you know how pretty it is, and how amusing. I\nshall probably be here the rest of the summer. There are some people I\nknow and whom I want you to know. Be so good as to arrive. Then I will\nthank you properly for your various Italian rhapsodies. I can’t reply on\nthe same scale--I have n’t the time. Do you know what I am doing? I am\nmaking love. I find it a most absorbing occupation. That is literally\nwhy I have not written to you before. I have been making love ever since\nthe last of May. It takes an immense amount of time, and everything else\nhas got terribly behindhand. I don’t mean to say that the experiment\nitself has gone on very fast; but I am trying to push it forward. I have\nn’t yet had time to test its success; but in this I want your help.\nYou know we great physicists never make an experiment without an\n‘assistant’--a humble individual who burns his fingers and stains his\nclothes in the cause of science, but whose interest in the problem is\nonly indirect. I want you to be my assistant, and I will guarantee\nthat your burns and stains shall not be dangerous. She is an extremely\ninteresting girl, and I really want you to see her--I want to know what\nyou think of her. She wants to know you, too, for I have talked a good\ndeal about you. There you have it, if gratified vanity will help you on\nthe way. Seriously, this is a real request. I want your opinion, your\nimpression. I want to see how she will affect you. I don’t say I ask\nfor your advice; that, of course, you will not undertake to give. But\nI desire a definition, a characterization; you know you toss off those\nthings. I don’t see why I should n’t tell you all this--I have always\ntold you everything. I have never pretended to know anything about\nwomen, but I have always supposed that you knew everything. You\ncertainly have always had the tone of that sort of omniscience. So come\nhere as soon as possible and let me see that you are not a humbug. She\n‘s a very handsome girl.”\n\nLongueville was so much amused with this appeal that he very soon\nstarted for Germany. In the reader, Gordon Wright’s letter will,\nperhaps, excite surprise rather than hilarity; but Longueville thought\nit highly characteristic of his friend. What it especially pointed to\nwas Gordon’s want of imagination--a deficiency which was a matter of\ncommon jocular allusion between the two young men, each of whom kept a\ncollection of acknowledged oddities as a playground for the other’s\nwit. Bernard had often spoken of his comrade’s want of imagination as a\nbottomless pit, into which Gordon was perpetually inviting him to lower\nhimself. “My dear fellow,” Bernard said, “you must really excuse me; I\ncannot take these subterranean excursions. I should lose my breath down\nthere; I should never come up alive. You know I have dropped things\ndown--little jokes and metaphors, little fantasies and paradoxes--and I\nhave never heard them touch bottom!” This was an epigram on the part\nof a young man who had a lively play of fancy; but it was none the less\ntrue that Gordon Wright had a firmly-treading, rather than a winged,\nintellect. Every phrase in his letter seemed, to Bernard, to march\nin stout-soled walking-boots, and nothing could better express his\nattachment to the process of reasoning things out than this proposal\nthat his friend should come and make a chemical analysis--a geometrical\nsurvey--of the lady of his love. “That I shall have any difficulty in\nforming an opinion, and any difficulty in expressing it when formed--of\nthis he has as little idea as that he shall have any difficulty in\naccepting it when expressed.” So Bernard reflected, as he rolled in the\ntrain to Munich. “Gordon’s mind,” he went on, “has no atmosphere; his\nintellectual process goes on in the void. There are no currents and\neddies to affect it, no high winds nor hot suns, no changes of season\nand temperature. His premises are neatly arranged, and his conclusions\nare perfectly calculable.”\n\nYet for the man on whose character he so freely exercised his wit\nBernard Longueville had a strong affection. It is nothing against\nthe validity of a friendship that the parties to it have not a mutual\nresemblance. There must be a basis of agreement, but the structure\nreared upon it may contain a thousand disparities. These two young men\nhad formed an alliance of old, in college days, and the bond between\nthem had been strengthened by the simple fact of its having survived the\nsentimental revolutions of early life. Its strongest link was a sort of\nmutual respect. Their tastes, their pursuits were different; but each\nof them had a high esteem for the other’s character. It may be said that\nthey were easily pleased; for it is certain that neither of them had\nperformed any very conspicuous action. They were highly civilized\nyoung Americans, born to an easy fortune and a tranquil destiny, and\nunfamiliar with the glitter of golden opportunities. If I did not shrink\nfrom disparaging the constitution of their native land for their own\ncredit, I should say that it had never been very definitely proposed to\nthese young gentlemen to distinguish themselves. On reaching manhood,\nthey had each come into property sufficient to make violent exertion\nsuperfluous. Gordon Wright, indeed, had inherited a large estate. Their\nwants being tolerably modest, they had not been tempted to strive for\nthe glory of building up commercial fortunes--the most obvious career\nopen to young Americans. They had, indeed, embraced no career at all,\nand if summoned to give an account of themselves would, perhaps, have\nfound it hard to tell any very impressive story. Gordon Wright was much\ninterested in physical science, and had ideas of his own on what is\ncalled the endowment of research. His ideas had taken a practical\nshape, and he had distributed money very freely among the investigating\nclasses, after which he had gone to spend a couple of years in Germany,\nsupposing it to be the land of laboratories. Here we find him at\npresent, cultivating relations with several learned bodies and promoting\nthe study of various tough branches of human knowledge, by paying the\nexpenses of difficult experiments. The experiments, it must be added,\nwere often of his own making, and he must have the honor of whatever\nbrilliancy attaches, in the estimation of the world, to such pursuits.\nIt was not, indeed, a brilliancy that dazzled Bernard Longueville, who,\nhowever, was not easily dazzled by anything. It was because he regarded\nhim in so plain and direct a fashion, that Bernard had an affection\nfor his friend--an affection to which it would perhaps be difficult to\nassign a definite cause. Personal sympathies are doubtless caused by\nsomething; but the causes are remote, mysterious to our daily vision,\nlike those of the particular state of the weather. We content ourselves\nwith remarking that it is fine or that it rains, and the enjoyment of\nour likes and dislikes is by no means apt to borrow its edge from\nthe keenness of our analysis. Longueville had a relish for fine\nquality--superior savour; and he was sensible of this merit in the\nsimple, candid, manly, affectionate nature of his comrade, which seemed\nto him an excellent thing of its kind. Gordon Wright had a tender heart\nand a strong will--a combination which, when the understanding is not\ntoo limited, is often the motive of admirable actions. There might\nsometimes be a question whether Gordon’s understanding were sufficiently\nunlimited, but the impulses of a generous temper often play a useful\npart in filling up the gaps of an incomplete imagination, and\nthe general impression that Wright produced was certainly that\nof intelligent good-nature. The reasons for appreciating Bernard\nLongueville were much more manifest. He pleased superficially, as well\nas fundamentally. Nature had sent him into the world with an armful\nof good gifts. He was very good-looking--tall, dark, agile, perfectly\nfinished, so good-looking that he might have been a fool and yet be\nforgiven. As has already been intimated, however, he was far from being\na fool. He had a number of talents, which, during three or four years\nthat followed his leaving college, had received the discipline of the\nstudy of the law. He had not made much of the law; but he had\nmade something of his talents. He was almost always spoken of as\n“accomplished;” people asked why he did n’t do something. This question\nwas never satisfactorily answered, the feeling being that Longueville\ndid more than many people in causing it to be asked. Moreover, there was\none thing he did constantly--he enjoyed himself. This is manifestly not\na career, and it has been said at the outset that he was not attached\nto any of the recognized professions. But without going into details,\nhe was a charming fellow--clever, urbane, free-handed, and with that\nfortunate quality in his appearance which is known as distinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHe had not specified, in writing to Gordon Wright, the day on which\nhe should arrive at Baden-Baden; it must be confessed that he was\nnot addicted to specifying days. He came to his journey’s end in the\nevening, and, on presenting himself at the hotel from which his friend\nhad dated his letter, he learned that Gordon Wright had betaken himself\nafter dinner, according to the custom of Baden-Baden, to the grounds\nof the Conversation-house. It was eight o’clock, and Longueville, after\nremoving the stains of travel, sat down to dine. His first impulse had\nbeen to send for Gordon to come and keep him company at his repast; but\non second thought he determined to make it as brief as possible. Having\nbrought it to a close, he took his way to the Kursaal. The great German\nwatering-place is one of the prettiest nooks in Europe, and of a summer\nevening in the gaming days, five-and-twenty years ago, it was one of the\nmost brilliant scenes. The lighted windows of the great temple of hazard\n(of as chaste an architecture as if it had been devoted to a much purer\ndivinity) opened wide upon the gardens and groves; the little river that\nissues from the bosky mountains of the Black Forest flowed, with an air\nof brook-like innocence, past the expensive hotels and lodging-houses;\nthe orchestra, in a high pavilion on the terrace of the Kursaal, played\na discreet accompaniment to the conversation of the ladies and gentlemen\nwho, scattered over the large expanse on a thousand little chairs,\npreferred for the time the beauties of nature to the shuffle of coin and\nthe calculation of chance; while the faint summer stars, twinkling above\nthe vague black hills and woods, looked down at the indifferent groups\nwithout venturing to drop their light upon them.\n\nLongueville, noting all this, went straight into the gaming-rooms; he\nwas curious to see whether his friend, being fond of experiments, was\ntrying combinations at roulette. But he was not to be found in any of\nthe gilded chambers, among the crowd that pressed in silence about the\ntables; so that Bernard presently came and began to wander about the\nlamp-lit terrace, where innumerable groups, seated and strolling, made\nthe place a gigantic conversazione. It seemed to him very agreeable and\namusing, and he remarked to himself that, for a man who was supposed not\nto take especially the Epicurean view of life, Gordon Wright, in coming\nto Baden, had certainly made himself comfortable. Longueville went his\nway, glancing from one cluster of talkers to another; and at last he saw\na face which brought him to a stop. He stood a moment looking at it; he\nknew he had seen it before. He had an excellent memory for faces; but\nit was some time before he was able to attach an identity to this one.\nWhere had he seen a little elderly lady with an expression of timorous\nvigilance, and a band of hair as softly white as a dove’s wing? The\nanswer to the question presently came--Where but in a grass-grown corner\nof an old Italian town? The lady was the mother of his inconsequent\nmodel, so that this mysterious personage was probably herself not far\noff. Before Longueville had time to verify this induction, he found his\neyes resting upon the broad back of a gentleman seated close to the old\nlady, and who, turning away from her, was talking to a young girl.\nIt was nothing but the back of this gentleman that he saw, but\nnevertheless, with the instinct of true friendship, he recognized in\nthis featureless expanse the robust personality of Gordon Wright. In a\nmoment he had stepped forward and laid his hand upon Wright’s shoulder.\n\nHis friend looked round, and then sprang up with a joyous exclamation\nand grasp of the hand.\n\n“My dear fellow--my dear Bernard! What on earth--when did you arrive?”\n\nWhile Bernard answered and explained a little, he glanced from his\nfriend’s good, gratified face at the young girl with whom Wright had\nbeen talking, and then at the lady on the other side, who was giving him\na bright little stare. He raised his hat to her and to the young\ngirl, and he became conscious, as regards the latter, of a certain\ndisappointment. She was very pretty; she was looking at him; but she was\nnot the heroine of the little incident of the terrace at Siena.\n\n“It ‘s just like Longueville, you know,” Gordon Wright went on; “he\nalways comes at you from behind; he ‘s so awfully fond of surprises.” He\nwas laughing; he was greatly pleased; he introduced Bernard to the two\nladies. “You must know Mrs. Vivian; you must know Miss Blanche Evers.”\n\nBernard took his place in the little circle; he wondered whether he\nought to venture upon a special recognition of Mrs. Vivian. Then it\nseemed to him that he should leave the option of this step with the\nlady, especially as he had detected recognition in her eye. But Mrs.\nVivian ventured upon nothing special; she contented herself with soft\ngeneralities--with remarking that she always liked to know when people\nwould arrive; that, for herself, she never enjoyed surprises.\n\n“And yet I imagine you have had your share,” said Longueville, with a\nsmile. He thought this might remind her of the moment when she came out\nof the little church at Siena and found her daughter posturing to an\nunknown painter.\n\nBut Mrs. Vivian, turning her benignant head about, gave but a\nsuperficial reply.\n\n“Oh, I have had my share of everything, good and bad. I don’t complain\nof anything.” And she gave a little deprecating laugh.\n\nGordon Wright shook hands with Bernard again; he seemed really very glad\nto see him. Longueville, remembering that Gordon had written to him\nthat he had been “making love,” began to seek in his countenance for the\nravages of passion. For the moment, however, they were not apparent; the\nexcellent, honest fellow looked placid and contented. Gordon Wright had\na clear gray eye, short, straight, flaxen hair, and a healthy diffusion\nof color. His features were thick and rather irregular; but his\ncountenance--in addition to the merit of its expression--derived a\ncertain grace from a powerful yellow moustache, to which its wearer\noccasionally gave a martial twist. Gordon Wright was not tall, but he\nwas strong, and in his whole person there was something well-planted and\nsturdy. He almost always dressed in light-colored garments, and he wore\nround his neck an eternal blue cravat. When he was agitated he grew very\nred. While he questioned Longueville about his journey and his health,\nhis whereabouts and his intentions, the latter, among his own replies,\nendeavored to read in Wright’s eyes some account of his present\nsituation. Was that pretty girl at his side the ambiguous object of his\nadoration, and, in that case, what was the function of the elder lady,\nand what had become of her argumentative daughter? Perhaps this was\nanother, a younger daughter, though, indeed, she bore no resemblance to\neither of Longueville’s friends. Gordon Wright, in spite of Bernard’s\ninterrogative glances, indulged in no optical confidences. He had\ntoo much to tell. He would keep his story till they should be alone\ntogether. It was impossible that they should adjourn just yet to\nsocial solitude; the two ladies were under Gordon’s protection. Mrs.\nVivian--Bernard felt a satisfaction in learning her name; it was as if a\ncurtain, half pulled up and stopped by a hitch, had suddenly been raised\naltogether--Mrs. Vivian sat looking up and down the terrace at the\ncrowd of loungers and talkers with an air of tender expectation. She was\nprobably looking for her elder daughter, and Longueville could not help\nwishing also that this young lady would arrive. Meanwhile, he saw that\nthe young girl to whom Gordon had been devoting himself was extremely\npretty, and appeared eminently approachable. Longueville had some talk\nwith her, reflecting that if she were the person concerning whom Gordon\nhad written him, it behooved him to appear to take an interest in her.\nThis view of the case was confirmed by Gordon Wright’s presently turning\naway to talk with Mrs. Vivian, so that his friend might be at liberty to\nmake acquaintance with their companion.\n\nThough she had not been with the others at Siena, it seemed to\nLongueville, with regard to her, too, that this was not the first time\nhe had seen her. She was simply the American pretty girl, whom he had\nseen a thousand times. It was a numerous sisterhood, pervaded by a\nstrong family likeness. This young lady had charming eyes (of the color\nof Gordon’s cravats), which looked everywhere at once and yet found time\nto linger in some places, where Longueville’s own eyes frequently\nmet them. She had soft brown hair, with a silky-golden thread in it,\nbeautifully arranged and crowned by a smart little hat that savoured\nof Paris. She had also a slender little figure, neatly rounded, and\ndelicate, narrow hands, prettily gloved. She moved about a great deal\nin her place, twisted her little flexible body and tossed her head,\nfingered her hair and examined the ornaments of her dress. She had\na great deal of conversation, Longueville speedily learned, and she\nexpressed herself with extreme frankness and decision. He asked her,\nto begin with, if she had been long at Baden, but the impetus of\nthis question was all she required. Turning her charming, conscious,\ncoquettish little face upon him, she instantly began to chatter.\n\n“I have been here about four weeks. I don’t know whether you call that\nlong. It does n’t seem long to me; I have had such a lovely time. I have\nmet ever so many people here I know--every day some one turns up. Now\nyou have turned up to-day.”\n\n“Ah, but you don’t know me,” said Longueville, laughing.\n\n“Well, I have heard a great deal about you!” cried the young girl, with\na pretty little stare of contradiction. “I think you know a great friend\nof mine, Miss Ella Maclane, of Baltimore. She ‘s travelling in Europe\nnow.” Longueville’s memory did not instantly respond to this signal, but\nhe expressed that rapturous assent which the occasion demanded, and\neven risked the observation that the young lady from Baltimore was very\npretty. “She ‘s far too lovely,” his companion went on. “I have often\nheard her speak of you. I think you know her sister rather better than\nyou know her. She has not been out very long. She is just as interesting\nas she can be. Her hair comes down to her feet. She ‘s travelling in\nNorway. She has been everywhere you can think of, and she ‘s going to\nfinish off with Finland. You can’t go any further than that, can you?\nThat ‘s one comfort; she will have to turn round and come back. I want\nher dreadfully to come to Baden-Baden.”\n\n“I wish she would,” said Longueville. “Is she travelling alone?”\n\n“Oh, no. They ‘ve got some Englishman. They say he ‘s devoted to Ella.\nEvery one seems to have an Englishman, now. We ‘ve got one here, Captain\nLovelock, the Honourable Augustus Lovelock. Well, they ‘re awfully\nhandsome. Ella Maclane is dying to come to Baden-Baden. I wish you ‘d\nwrite to her. Her father and mother have got some idea in their heads;\nthey think it ‘s improper--what do you call it?--immoral. I wish you\nwould write to her and tell her it is n’t. I wonder if they think that\nMrs. Vivian would come to a place that ‘s immoral. Mrs. Vivian says she\nwould take her in a moment; she does n’t seem to care how many she has.\nI declare, she ‘s only too kind. You know I ‘m in Mrs. Vivian’s care.\nMy mother ‘s gone to Marienbad. She would let me go with Mrs. Vivian\nanywhere, on account of the influence--she thinks so much of Mrs.\nVivian’s influence. I have always heard a great deal about it, have n’t\nyou? I must say it ‘s lovely; it ‘s had a wonderful effect upon me. I\ndon’t want to praise myself, but it has. You ask Mrs. Vivian if I have\nn’t been good. I have been just as good as I can be. I have been so\npeaceful, I have just sat here this way. Do you call this immoral? You\n‘re not obliged to gamble if you don’t want to. Ella Maclane’s father\nseems to think you get drawn in. I ‘m sure I have n’t been drawn in. I\nknow what you ‘re going to say--you ‘re going to say I have been drawn\nout. Well, I have, to-night. We just sit here so quietly--there ‘s\nnothing to do but to talk. We make a little party by ourselves--are you\ngoing to belong to our party? Two of us are missing--Miss Vivian and\nCaptain Lovelock. Captain Lovelock has gone with her into the rooms to\nexplain the gambling--Miss Vivian always wants everything explained. I\nam sure I understood it the first time I looked at the tables. Have you\never seen Miss Vivian? She ‘s very much admired, she ‘s so very unusual.\nBlack hair ‘s so uncommon--I see you have got it too--but I mean for\nyoung ladies. I am sure one sees everything here. There ‘s a woman\nthat comes to the tables--a Portuguese countess--who has hair that is\npositively blue. I can’t say I admire it when it comes to that shade.\nBlue ‘s my favorite color, but I prefer it in the eyes,” continued\nLongueville’s companion, resting upon him her own two brilliant little\nspecimens of the tint.\n\nHe listened with that expression of clear amusement which is not always\nan indication of high esteem, but which even pretty chatterers, who are\nnot the reverse of estimable, often prefer to masculine inattention; and\nwhile he listened Bernard, according to his wont, made his reflections.\nHe said to himself that there were two kinds of pretty girls--the\nacutely conscious and the finely unconscious. Mrs. Vivian’s protege was\na member of the former category; she belonged to the genus coquette. We\nall have our conception of the indispensable, and the indispensable, to\nthis young lady, was a spectator; almost any male biped would serve\nthe purpose. To her spectator she addressed, for the moment, the whole\nvolume of her being--addressed it in her glances, her attitudes, her\nexclamations, in a hundred little experiments of tone and gesture and\nposition. And these rustling artifices were so innocent and obvious\nthat the directness of her desire to be well with her observer became\nin itself a grace; it led Bernard afterward to say to himself that the\nnatural vocation and metier of little girls for whom existence was but a\nshimmering surface, was to prattle and ruffle their plumage; their\nview of life and its duties was as simple and superficial as that of\nan Oriental bayadere. It surely could not be with regard to this\ntransparent little flirt that Gordon Wright desired advice; you could\nliterally see the daylight--or rather the Baden gaslight--on the other\nside of her. She sat there for a minute, turning her little empty head\nto and fro, and catching Bernard’s eye every time she moved; she had for\nthe instant the air of having exhausted all topics. Just then a young\nlady, with a gentleman at her side, drew near to the little group, and\nLongueville, perceiving her, instantly got up from his chair.\n\n“There ‘s a beauty of the unconscious class!” he said to himself. He\nknew her face very well; he had spent half an hour in copying it.\n\n“Here comes Miss Vivian!” said Gordon Wright, also getting up, as if to\nmake room for the daughter near the mother.\n\nShe stopped in front of them, smiling slightly, and then she rested her\neyes upon Longueville. Their gaze at first was full and direct, but\nit expressed nothing more than civil curiosity. This was immediately\nfollowed, however, by the light of recognition--recognition embarrassed,\nand signalling itself by a blush.\n\nMiss Vivian’s companion was a powerful, handsome fellow, with a\nremarkable auburn beard, who struck the observer immediately as being\nuncommonly well dressed. He carried his hands in the pockets of a little\njacket, the button-hole of which was adorned with a blooming rose. He\napproached Blanche Evers, smiling and dandling his body a little, and\nmaking her two or three jocular bows.\n\n“Well, I hope you have lost every penny you put on the table!” said the\nyoung girl, by way of response to his obeisances.\n\nHe began to laugh and repeat them.\n\n“I don’t care what I lose, so long--so long--”\n\n“So long as what, pray?”\n\n“So long as you let me sit down by you!” And he dropped, very gallantly,\ninto a chair on the other side of her.\n\n“I wish you would lose all your property!” she replied, glancing at\nBernard.\n\n“It would be a very small stake,” said Captain Lovelock. “Would you\nreally like to see me reduced to misery?”\n\nWhile this graceful dialogue rapidly established itself, Miss Vivian\nremoved her eyes from Longueville’s face and turned toward her\nmother. But Gordon Wright checked this movement by laying his hand on\nLongueville’s shoulder and proceeding to introduce his friend.\n\n“This is the accomplished creature, Mr. Bernard Longueville, of whom you\nhave heard me speak. One of his accomplishments, as you see, is to drop\ndown from the moon.”\n\n“No, I don’t drop from the moon,” said Bernard, laughing. “I drop\nfrom--Siena!” He offered his hand to Miss Vivian, who for an appreciable\ninstant hesitated to extend her own. Then she returned his salutation,\nwithout any response to his allusion to Siena.\n\nShe declined to take a seat, and said she was tired and preferred to go\nhome. With this suggestion her mother immediately complied, and the two\nladies appealed to the indulgence of little Miss Evers, who was obliged\nto renounce the society of Captain Lovelock. She enjoyed this luxury,\nhowever, on the way to Mrs. Vivian’s lodgings, toward which they all\nslowly strolled, in the sociable Baden fashion. Longueville might\nnaturally have found himself next Miss Vivian, but he received an\nimpression that she avoided him. She walked in front, and Gordon Wright\nstrolled beside her, though Longueville noticed that they appeared to\nexchange but few words. He himself offered his arm to Mrs. Vivian, who\npaced along with a little lightly-wavering step, making observations\nupon the beauties of Baden and the respective merits of the hotels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n“Which of them is it?” asked Longueville of his friend, after they had\nbidden good-night to the three ladies and to Captain Lovelock, who went\noff to begin, as he said, the evening. They stood, when they had turned\naway from the door of Mrs. Vivian’s lodgings, in the little, rough-paved\nGerman street.\n\n“Which of them is what?” Gordon asked, staring at his companion.\n\n“Oh, come,” said Longueville, “you are not going to begin to play at\nmodesty at this hour! Did n’t you write to me that you had been making\nviolent love?”\n\n“Violent? No.”\n\n“The more shame to you! Has your love-making been feeble?”\n\nHis friend looked at him a moment rather soberly.\n\n“I suppose you thought it a queer document--that letter I wrote you.”\n\n“I thought it characteristic,” said Longueville smiling.\n\n“Is n’t that the same thing?”\n\n“Not in the least. I have never thought you a man of oddities.” Gordon\nstood there looking at him with a serious eye, half appealing, half\nquestioning; but at these last words he glanced away. Even a very modest\nman may wince a little at hearing himself denied the distinction of a\nfew variations from the common type. Longueville made this reflection,\nand it struck him, also, that his companion was in a graver mood than he\nhad expected; though why, after all, should he have been in a state of\nexhilaration? “Your letter was a very natural, interesting one,” Bernard\nadded.\n\n“Well, you see,” said Gordon, facing his companion again, “I have been a\ngood deal preoccupied.”\n\n“Obviously, my dear fellow!”\n\n“I want very much to marry.”\n\n“It ‘s a capital idea,” said Longueville.\n\n“I think almost as well of it,” his friend declared, “as if I had\ninvented it. It has struck me for the first time.”\n\nThese words were uttered with a mild simplicity which provoked\nLongueville to violent laughter.\n\n“My dear fellow,” he exclaimed, “you have, after all, your little\noddities.”\n\nSingularly enough, however, Gordon Wright failed to appear flattered by\nthis concession.\n\n“I did n’t send for you to laugh at me,” he said.\n\n“Ah, but I have n’t travelled three hundred miles to cry! Seriously,\nsolemnly, then, it is one of these young ladies that has put marriage\ninto your head?”\n\n“Not at all. I had it in my head.”\n\n“Having a desire to marry, you proceeded to fall in love.”\n\n“I am not in love!” said Gordon Wright, with some energy.\n\n“Ah, then, my dear fellow, why did you send for me?”\n\nWright looked at him an instant in silence.\n\n“Because I thought you were a good fellow, as well as a clever one.”\n\n“A good fellow!” repeated Longueville. “I don’t understand your\nconfounded scientific nomenclature. But excuse me; I won’t laugh. I am\nnot a clever fellow; but I am a good one.” He paused a moment, and then\nlaid his hand on his companion’s shoulder. “My dear Gordon, it ‘s no\nuse; you are in love.”\n\n“Well, I don’t want to be,” said Wright.\n\n“Heavens, what a horrible sentiment!”\n\n“I want to marry with my eyes open. I want to know my wife. You don’t\nknow people when you are in love with them. Your impressions are\ncolored.”\n\n“They are supposed to be, slightly. And you object to color?”\n\n“Well, as I say, I want to know the woman I marry, as I should know any\none else. I want to see her as clearly.”\n\n“Depend upon it, you have too great an appetite for knowledge; you set\ntoo high an esteem upon the dry light of science.”\n\n“Ah!” said Gordon promptly; “of course I want to be fond of her.”\n\nBernard, in spite of his protest, began to laugh again.\n\n“My dear Gordon, you are better than your theories. Your passionate\nheart contradicts your frigid intellect. I repeat it--you are in love.”\n\n“Please don’t repeat it again,” said Wright.\n\nBernard took his arm, and they walked along.\n\n“What shall I call it, then? You are engaged in making studies for\nmatrimony.”\n\n“I don’t in the least object to your calling it that. My studies are of\nextreme interest.”\n\n“And one of those young ladies is the fair volume that contains the\nprecious lesson,” said Longueville. “Or perhaps your text-book is in two\nvolumes?”\n\n“No; there is one of them I am not studying at all. I never could do two\nthings at once.”\n\n“That proves you are in love. One can’t be in love with two women\nat once, but one may perfectly have two of them--or as many as you\nplease--up for a competitive examination. However, as I asked you\nbefore, which of these young ladies is it that you have selected?”\n\nGordon Wright stopped abruptly, eying his friend.\n\n“Which should you say?”\n\n“Ah, that ‘s not a fair question,” Bernard urged. “It would be invidious\nfor me to name one rather than the other, and if I were to mention the\nwrong one, I should feel as if I had been guilty of a rudeness towards\nthe other. Don’t you see?”\n\nGordon saw, perhaps, but he held to his idea of making his companion\ncommit himself.\n\n“Never mind the rudeness. I will do the same by you some day, to make it\nup. Which of them should you think me likely to have taken a fancy to?\nOn general grounds, now, from what you know of me?” He proposed this\nproblem with an animated eye.\n\n“You forget,” his friend said, “that though I know, thank heaven, a good\ndeal of you, I know very little of either of those girls. I have had too\nlittle evidence.”\n\n“Yes, but you are a man who notices. That ‘s why I wanted you to come.”\n\n“I spoke only to Miss Evers.”\n\n“Yes, I know you have never spoken to Miss Vivian.” Gordon Wright stood\nlooking at Bernard and urging his point as he pronounced these words.\nBernard felt peculiarly conscious of his gaze. The words represented an\nillusion, and Longueville asked himself quickly whether it were not his\nduty to dispel it. The answer came more slowly than the question,\nbut still it came, in the shape of a negative. The illusion was but a\ntrifling one, and it was not for him, after all, to let his friend know\nthat he had already met Miss Vivian. It was for the young girl\nherself, and since she had not done so--although she had the\nopportunity--Longueville said to himself that he was bound in honor not\nto speak. These reflections were very soon made, but in the midst of\nthem our young man, thanks to a great agility of mind, found time\nto observe, tacitly, that it was odd, just there, to see his “honor”\n thrusting in its nose. Miss Vivian, in her own good time, would\ndoubtless mention to Gordon the little incident of Siena. It was\nBernard’s fancy, for a moment, that he already knew it, and that the\nremark he had just uttered had an ironical accent; but this impression\nwas completely dissipated by the tone in which he added--“All the same,\nyou noticed her.”\n\n“Oh, yes; she is very noticeable.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Gordon, “you will see. I should like you to make\nit out. Of course, if I am really giving my attention to one to the\nexclusion of the other, it will be easy to discover.”\n\nLongueville was half amused, half irritated by his friend’s own relish\nof his little puzzle. “‘The exclusion of the other’ has an awkward\nsound,” he answered, as they walked on. “Am I to notice that you are\nvery rude to one of the young ladies?”\n\n“Oh dear, no. Do you think there is a danger of that?”\n\n“Well,” said Longueville, “I have already guessed.”\n\nGordon Wright remonstrated. “Don’t guess yet--wait a few days. I won’t\ntell you now.”\n\n“Let us see if he does n’t tell me,” said Bernard, privately. And he\nmeditated a moment. “When I presented myself, you were sitting very\nclose to Miss Evers and talking very earnestly. Your head was bent\ntoward her--it was very lover-like. Decidedly, Miss Evers is the\nobject!”\n\nFor a single instant Gordon Wright hesitated, and then--“I hope I have\nn’t seemed rude to Miss Vivian!” he exclaimed.\n\nBernard broke into a light laugh. “My dear Gordon, you are very much in\nlove!” he remarked, as they arrived at their hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nLife at Baden-Baden proved a very sociable affair, and Bernard\nLongueville perceived that he should not lack opportunity for the\nexercise of those gifts of intelligence to which Gordon Wright had\nappealed. The two friends took long walks through the woods and over the\nmountains, and they mingled with human life in the crowded precincts of\nthe Conversation-house. They engaged in a ramble on the morning after\nBernard’s arrival, and wandered far away, over hill and dale. The\nBaden forests are superb, and the composition of the landscape is most\neffective. There is always a bosky dell in the foreground, and a\npurple crag embellished with a ruined tower at a proper angle. A little\ntimber-and-plaster village peeps out from a tangle of plum-trees, and a\nway-side tavern, in comfortable recurrence, solicits concessions to the\nnational custom of frequent refreshment. Gordon Wright, who was a dogged\npedestrian, always enjoyed doing his ten miles, and Longueville, who was\nan incorrigible stroller, felt a keen relish for the picturesqueness\nof the country. But it was not, on this occasion, of the charms of the\nlandscape or the pleasures of locomotion that they chiefly discoursed.\nTheir talk took a more closely personal turn. It was a year since they\nhad met, and there were many questions to ask and answer, many arrears\nof gossip to make up. As they stretched themselves on the grass on a\nsun-warmed hill-side, beneath a great German oak whose arms were quiet\nin the blue summer air, there was a lively exchange of impressions,\nopinions, speculations, anecdotes. Gordon Wright was surely an excellent\nfriend. He took an interest in you. He asked no idle questions and made\nno vague professions; but he entered into your situation, he examined\nit in detail, and what he learned he never forgot. Months afterwards,\nhe asked you about things which you yourself had forgotten. He was not a\nman of whom it would be generally said that he had the gift of\nsympathy; but he gave his attention to a friend’s circumstances with\na conscientious fixedness which was at least very far removed from\nindifference. Bernard had the gift of sympathy--or at least he was\nsupposed to have it; but even he, familiar as he must therefore have\nbeen with the practice of this charming virtue, was at times so\nstruck with his friend’s fine faculty of taking other people’s affairs\nseriously that he constantly exclaimed to himself, “The excellent\nfellow--the admirable nature!”\n\nBernard had two or three questions to ask about the three persons who\nappeared to have formed for some time his companion’s principal society,\nbut he was indisposed to press them. He felt that he should see for\nhimself, and at a prospect of entertainment of this kind, his\nfancy always kindled. Gordon was, moreover, at first rather shy of\nconfidences, though after they had lain on the grass ten minutes there\nwas a good deal said.\n\n“Now what do you think of her face?” Gordon asked, after staring a while\nat the sky through the oak-boughs.\n\n“Of course, in future,” said Longueville, “whenever you make use of\nthe personal pronoun feminine, I am to understand that Miss Vivian is\nindicated.”\n\n“Her name is Angela,” said Gordon; “but of course I can scarcely call\nher that.”\n\n“It ‘s a beautiful name,” Longueville rejoined; “but I may say, in\nanswer to your question, that I am not struck with the fact that her\nface corresponds to it.”\n\n“You don’t think her face beautiful, then?”\n\n“I don’t think it angelic. But how can I tell? I have only had a glimpse\nof her.”\n\n“Wait till she looks at you and speaks--wait till she smiles,” said\nGordon.\n\n“I don’t think I saw her smile--at least, not at me, directly. I hope\nshe will!” Longueville went on. “But who is she--this beautiful girl\nwith the beautiful name?”\n\n“She is her mother’s daughter,” said Gordon Wright. “I don’t really know\na great deal more about her than that.”\n\n“And who is her mother?”\n\n“A delightful little woman, devoted to Miss Vivian. She is a widow, and\nAngela is her only child. They have lived a great deal in Europe; they\nhave but a modest income. Over here, Mrs. Vivian says, they can get a\nlot of things for their money that they can’t get at home. So they stay,\nyou see. When they are at home they live in New York. They know some of\nmy people there. When they are in Europe they live about in different\nplaces. They are fond of Italy. They are extremely nice; it ‘s\nimpossible to be nicer. They are very fond of books, fond of music, and\nart, and all that. They always read in the morning. They only come out\nrather late in the day.”\n\n“I see they are very superior people,” said Bernard. “And little Miss\nEvers--what does she do in the morning? I know what she does in the\nevening!”\n\n“I don’t know what her regular habits are. I have n’t paid much\nattention to her. She is very pretty.”\n\n“Wunderschon!” said Bernard. “But you were certainly talking to her last\nevening.”\n\n“Of course I talk to her sometimes. She is totally different from Angela\nVivian--not nearly so cultivated; but she seems very charming.”\n\n“A little silly, eh?” Bernard suggested.\n\n“She certainly is not so wise as Miss Vivian.”\n\n“That would be too much to ask, eh? But the Vivians, as kind as they are\nwise, have taken her under their protection.”\n\n“Yes,” said Gordon, “they are to keep her another month or two. Her\nmother has gone to Marienbad, which I believe is thought a dull place\nfor a young girl; so that, as they were coming here, they offered to\nbring her with them. Mrs. Evers is an old friend of Mrs. Vivian, who, on\nleaving Italy, had come up to Dresden to be with her. They spent a month\nthere together; Mrs. Evers had been there since the winter. I think\nMrs. Vivian really came to Baden-Baden--she would have preferred a less\nexpensive place--to bring Blanche Evers. Her mother wanted her so much\nto come.”\n\n“And was it for her sake that Captain Lovelock came, too?” Bernard\nasked.\n\nGordon Wright stared a moment.\n\n“I ‘m sure I don’t know!”\n\n“Of course you can’t be interested in that,” said Bernard smiling. “Who\nis Captain Lovelock?”\n\n“He is an Englishman. I believe he is what ‘s called aristocratically\nconnected--the younger brother of a lord, or something of that sort.”\n\n“Is he a clever man?”\n\n“I have n’t talked with him much, but I doubt it. He is rather rakish;\nhe plays a great deal.”\n\n“But is that considered here a proof of rakishness?” asked Bernard.\n“Have n’t you played a little yourself?”\n\nGordon hesitated a moment.\n\n“Yes, I have played a little. I wanted to try some experiments. I had\nmade some arithmetical calculations of probabilities, which I wished to\ntest.”\n\nBernard gave a long laugh.\n\n“I am delighted with the reasons you give for amusing yourself!\nArithmetical calculations!”\n\n“I assure you they are the real reasons!” said Gordon, blushing a\nlittle.\n\n“That ‘s just the beauty of it. You were not afraid of being ‘drawn in,’\nas little Miss Evers says?”\n\n“I am never drawn in, whatever the thing may be. I go in, or I stay out;\nbut I am not drawn,” said Gordon Wright.\n\n“You were not drawn into coming with Mrs. Vivian and her daughter from\nDresden to this place?”\n\n“I did n’t come with them; I came a week later.”\n\n“My dear fellow,” said Bernard, “that distinction is unworthy of your\nhabitual candor.”\n\n“Well, I was not fascinated; I was not overmastered. I wanted to come to\nBaden.”\n\n“I have no doubt you did. Had you become very intimate with your friends\nin Dresden?”\n\n“I had only seen them three times.”\n\n“After which you followed them to this place? Ah, don’t say you were not\nfascinated!” cried Bernard, laughing and springing to his feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThat evening, in the gardens of the Kursaal, he renewed acquaintance\nwith Angela Vivian. Her mother came, as usual, to sit and listen to the\nmusic, accompanied by Blanche Evers, who was in turn attended by Captain\nLovelock. This little party found privacy in the crowd; they seated\nthemselves in a quiet corner in an angle of one of the barriers of the\nterrace, while the movement of the brilliant Baden world went on around\nthem. Gordon Wright engaged in conversation with Mrs. Vivian, while\nBernard enjoyed an interview with her daughter. This young lady\ncontinued to ignore the fact of their previous meeting, and our hero\nsaid to himself that all he wished was to know what she preferred--he\nwould rigidly conform to it. He conformed to her present programme; he\nhad ventured to pronounce the word Siena the evening before, but he\nwas careful not to pronounce it again. She had her reasons for her own\nreserve; he wondered what they were, and it gave him a certain pleasure\nto wonder. He enjoyed the consciousness of their having a secret\ntogether, and it became a kind of entertaining suspense to see how long\nshe would continue to keep it. For himself, he was in no hurry to let\nthe daylight in; the little incident at Siena had been, in itself, a\ncharming affair; but Miss Vivian’s present attitude gave it a sort of\nmystic consecration. He thought she carried it off very well--the theory\nthat she had not seen him before; last evening she had been slightly\nconfused, but now she was as self-possessed as if the line she had taken\nwere a matter of conscience. Why should it be a matter of conscience?\nWas she in love with Gordon Wright, and did she wish, in consequence,\nto forget--and wish him not to suspect--that she had ever received an\nexpression of admiration from another man? This was not likely; it was\nnot likely, at least, that Miss Vivian wished to pass for a prodigy of\ninnocence; for if to be admired is to pay a tribute to corruption, it\nwas perfectly obvious that so handsome a girl must have tasted of the\ntree of knowledge. As for her being in love with Gordon Wright, that of\ncourse was another affair, and Bernard did not pretend, as yet, to have\nan opinion on this point, beyond hoping very much that she might be.\n\nHe was not wrong in the impression of her good looks that he had carried\naway from the short interview at Siena. She had a charmingly chiselled\nface, with a free, pure outline, a clear, fair complexion, and the eyes\nand hair of a dusky beauty. Her features had a firmness which\nsuggested tranquillity, and yet her expression was light and quick, a\ncombination--or a contradiction--which gave an original stamp to her\nbeauty. Bernard remembered that he had thought it a trifle “bold”; but\nhe now perceived that this had been but a vulgar misreading of her dark,\ndirect, observant eye. The eye was a charming one; Bernard discovered in\nit, little by little, all sorts of things; and Miss Vivian was, for the\npresent, simply a handsome, intelligent, smiling girl. He gave her an\nopportunity to make an allusion to Siena; he said to her that his friend\ntold him that she and her mother had been spending the winter in Italy.\n\n“Oh yes,” said Angela Vivian; “we were in the far south; we were five\nmonths at Sorrento.”\n\n“And nowhere else?”\n\n“We spent a few days in Rome. We usually prefer the quiet places; that\nis my mother’s taste.”\n\n“It was not your mother’s taste, then,” said Bernard, “that brought you\nto Baden?”\n\nShe looked at him a moment.\n\n“You mean that Baden is not quiet?”\n\nLongueville glanced about at the moving, murmuring crowd, at the lighted\nwindows of the Conversation-house, at the great orchestra perched up in\nits pagoda.\n\n“This is not my idea of absolute tranquillity.”\n\n“Nor mine, either,” said Miss Vivian. “I am not fond of absolute\ntranquillity.”\n\n“How do you arrange it, then, with your mother?”\n\nAgain she looked at him a moment, with her clever, slightly mocking\nsmile.\n\n“As you see. By making her come where I wish.”\n\n“You have a strong will,” said Bernard. “I see that.”\n\n“No. I have simply a weak mother. But I make sacrifices too, sometimes.”\n\n“What do you call sacrifices?”\n\n“Well, spending the winter at Sorrento.”\n\nBernard began to laugh, and then he told her she must have had a very\nhappy life--“to call a winter at Sorrento a sacrifice.”\n\n“It depends upon what one gives up,” said Miss Vivian.\n\n“What did you give up?”\n\nShe touched him with her mocking smile again.\n\n“That is not a very civil question, asked in that way.”\n\n“You mean that I seem to doubt your abnegation?”\n\n“You seem to insinuate that I had nothing to renounce. I gave up--I\ngave up--” and she looked about her, considering a little--“I gave up\nsociety.”\n\n“I am glad you remember what it was,” said Bernard. “If I have seemed\nuncivil, let me make it up. When a woman speaks of giving up society,\nwhat she means is giving up admiration. You can never have given up\nthat--you can never have escaped from it. You must have found it even at\nSorrento.”\n\n“It may have been there, but I never found it. It was very\nrespectful--it never expressed itself.”\n\n“That is the deepest kind,” said Bernard.\n\n“I prefer the shallower varieties,” the young girl answered.\n\n“Well,” said Bernard, “you must remember that although shallow\nadmiration expresses itself, all the admiration that expresses itself is\nnot shallow.”\n\nMiss Vivian hesitated a moment.\n\n“Some of it is impertinent,” she said, looking straight at him, rather\ngravely.\n\nBernard hesitated about as long.\n\n“When it is impertinent it is shallow. That comes to the same thing.”\n\nThe young girl frowned a little.\n\n“I am not sure that I understand--I am rather stupid. But you see how\nright I am in my taste for such places as this. I have to come here to\nhear such ingenious remarks.”\n\n“You should add that my coming, as well, has something to do with it.”\n\n“Everything!” said Miss Vivian.\n\n“Everything? Does no one else make ingenious remarks? Does n’t my friend\nWright?”\n\n“Mr. Wright says excellent things, but I should not exactly call them\ningenious remarks.”\n\n“It is not what Wright says; it ‘s what he does. That ‘s the charm!”\n said Bernard.\n\nHis companion was silent for a moment. “That ‘s not usually a charm;\ngood conduct is not thought pleasing.”\n\n“It surely is not thought the reverse!” Bernard exclaimed.\n\n“It does n’t rank--in the opinion of most people--among the things that\nmake men agreeable.”\n\n“It depends upon what you call agreeable.”\n\n“Exactly so,” said Miss Vivian. “It all depends on that.”\n\n“But the agreeable,” Bernard went on--“it is n’t after all, fortunately,\nsuch a subtle idea! The world certainly is agreed to think that virtue\nis a beautiful thing.”\n\nMiss Vivian dropped her eyes a moment, and then, looking up,\n\n“Is it a charm?” she asked.\n\n“For me there is no charm without it,” Bernard declared.\n\n“I am afraid that for me there is,” said the young girl.\n\nBernard was puzzled--he who was not often puzzled. His companion\nstruck him as altogether too clever to be likely to indulge in a silly\naffectation of cynicism. And yet, without this, how could one account\nfor her sneering at virtue?\n\n“You talk as if you had sounded the depths of vice!” he said, laughing.\n“What do you know about other than virtuous charms?”\n\n“I know, of course, nothing about vice; but I have known virtue when it\nwas very tiresome.”\n\n“Ah, then it was a poor affair. It was poor virtue. The best virtue is\nnever tiresome.”\n\nMiss Vivian looked at him a little, with her fine discriminating eye.\n\n“What a dreadful thing to have to think any virtue poor!”\n\nThis was a touching reflection, and it might have gone further had not\nthe conversation been interrupted by Mrs. Vivian’s appealing to her\ndaughter to aid a defective recollection of a story about a Spanish\nfamily they had met at Biarritz, with which she had undertaken to\nentertain Gordon Wright. After this, the little circle was joined by\na party of American friends who were spending a week at Baden, and the\nconversation became general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nBut on the following evening, Bernard again found himself seated in\nfriendly colloquy with this interesting girl, while Gordon Wright\ndiscoursed with her mother on one side, and little Blanche Evers\nchattered to the admiring eyes of Captain Lovelock on the other.\n\n“You and your mother are very kind to that little girl,” our hero said;\n“you must be a great advantage to her.”\n\nAngela Vivian directed her eyes to her neighbors, and let them rest\na while on the young girl’s little fidgeting figure and her fresh,\ncoquettish face. For some moments she said nothing, and to Longueville,\nturning over several things in his mind, and watching her, it seemed\nthat her glance was one of disfavor. He divined, he scarcely knew how,\nthat her esteem for her pretty companion was small.\n\n“I don’t know that I am very kind,” said Miss Vivian. “I have done\nnothing in particular for her.”\n\n“Mr. Wright tells me you came to this place mainly on her account.”\n\n“I came for myself,” said Miss Vivian. “The consideration you speak of\nperhaps had weight with my mother.”\n\n“You are not an easy person to say appreciative things to,” Bernard\nrejoined. “One is tempted to say them; but you don’t take them.”\n\nThe young girl colored as she listened to this observation.\n\n“I don’t think you know,” she murmured, looking away. Then, “Set it down\nto modesty,” she added.\n\n“That, of course, is what I have done. To what else could one possibly\nattribute an indifference to compliments?”\n\n“There is something else. One might be proud.”\n\n“There you are again!” Bernard exclaimed. “You won’t even let me praise\nyour modesty.”\n\n“I would rather you should rebuke my pride.”\n\n“That is so humble a speech that it leaves no room for rebuke.”\n\nFor a moment Miss Vivian said nothing.\n\n“Men are singularly base,” she declared presently, with a little smile.\n“They don’t care in the least to say things that might help a person.\nThey only care to say things that may seem effective and agreeable.”\n\n“I see: you think that to say agreeable things is a great misdemeanor.”\n\n“It comes from their vanity,” Miss Vivian went on, as if she had not\nheard him. “They wish to appear agreeable and get credit for cleverness\nand tendresse, no matter how silly it would be for another person to\nbelieve them.”\n\nBernard was a good deal amused, and a little nettled.\n\n“Women, then,” he said, “have rather a fondness for producing a bad\nimpression--they like to appear disagreeable?”\n\nHis companion bent her eyes upon her fan for a moment as she opened and\nclosed it.\n\n“They are capable of resigning themselves to it--for a purpose.”\n\nBernard was moved to extreme merriment.\n\n“For what purpose?”\n\n“I don’t know that I mean for a purpose,” said Miss Vivian; “but for a\nnecessity.”\n\n“Ah, what an odious necessity!”\n\n“Necessities usually are odious. But women meet them. Men evade them and\nshirk them.”\n\n“I contest your proposition. Women are themselves necessities; but they\nare not odious ones!” And Bernard added, in a moment, “One could n’t\nevade them, if they were!”\n\n“I object to being called a necessity,” said Angela Vivian. “It\ndiminishes one’s merit.”\n\n“Ah, but it enhances the charm of life!”\n\n“For men, doubtless!”\n\n“The charm of life is very great,” Bernard went on, looking up at the\ndusky hills and the summer stars, seen through a sort of mist of music\nand talk, and of powdery light projected from the softly lurid windows\nof the gaming-rooms. “The charm of life is extreme. I am unacquainted\nwith odious necessities. I object to nothing!”\n\nAngela Vivian looked about her as he had done--looked perhaps a moment\nlonger at the summer stars; and if she had not already proved herself a\nyoung lady of a contradictory turn, it might have been supposed she was\njust then tacitly admitting the charm of life to be considerable.\n\n“Do you suppose Miss Evers often resigns herself to being\ndisagreeable--for a purpose?” asked Longueville, who had glanced at\nCaptain Lovelock’s companion again.\n\n“She can’t be disagreeable; she is too gentle, too soft.”\n\n“Do you mean too silly?”\n\n“I don’t know that I call her silly. She is not very wise; but she has\nno pretensions--absolutely none--so that one is not struck with anything\nincongruous.”\n\n“What a terrible description! I suppose one ought to have a few\npretensions.”\n\n“You see one comes off more easily without them,” said Miss Vivian.\n\n“Do you call that coming off easily?”\n\nShe looked at him a moment gravely.\n\n“I am very fond of Blanche,” she said.\n\n“Captain Lovelock is rather fond of her,” Bernard went on.\n\nThe girl assented.\n\n“He is completely fascinated--he is very much in love with her.”\n\n“And do they mean to make an international match?”\n\n“I hope not; my mother and I are greatly troubled.”\n\n“Is n’t he a good fellow?”\n\n“He is a good fellow; but he is a mere trifler. He has n’t a penny, I\nbelieve, and he has very expensive habits. He gambles a great deal. We\ndon’t know what to do.”\n\n“You should send for the young lady’s mother.”\n\n“We have written to her pressingly. She answers that Blanche can take\ncare of herself, and that she must stay at Marienbad to finish her cure.\nShe has just begun a new one.”\n\n“Ah well,” said Bernard, “doubtless Blanche can take care of herself.”\n\nFor a moment his companion said nothing; then she exclaimed--\n\n“It ‘s what a girl ought to be able to do!”\n\n“I am sure you are!” said Bernard.\n\nShe met his eyes, and she was going to make some rejoinder; but before\nshe had time to speak, her mother’s little, clear, conciliatory voice\ninterposed. Mrs. Vivian appealed to her daughter, as she had done the\nnight before.\n\n“Dear Angela, what was the name of the gentleman who delivered that\ndelightful course of lectures that we heard in Geneva, on--what was the\ntitle?--‘The Redeeming Features of the Pagan Morality.’”\n\nAngela flushed a little.\n\n“I have quite forgotten his name, mamma,” she said, without looking\nround.\n\n“Come and sit by me, my dear, and we will talk them over. I wish Mr.\nWright to hear about them,” Mrs. Vivian went on.\n\n“Do you wish to convert him to paganism?” Bernard asked.\n\n“The lectures were very dull; they had no redeeming features,” said\nAngela, getting up, but turning away from her mother. She stood\nlooking at Bernard Longueville; he saw she was annoyed at her mother’s\ninterference. “Every now and then,” she said, “I take a turn through\nthe gaming-rooms. The last time, Captain Lovelock went with me. Will you\ncome to-night?”\n\nBernard assented with expressive alacrity; he was charmed with her not\nwishing to break off her conversation with him.\n\n“Ah, we ‘ll all go!” said Mrs. Vivian, who had been listening, and she\ninvited the others to accompany her to the Kursaal.\n\nThey left their places, but Angela went first, with Bernard Longueville\nby her side; and the idea of her having publicly braved her mother,\nas it were, for the sake of his society, lent for the moment an almost\necstatic energy to his tread. If he had been tempted to presume upon his\ntriumph, however, he would have found a check in the fact that the young\ngirl herself tasted very soberly of the sweets of defiance. She\nwas silent and grave; she had a manner which took the edge from the\nwantonness of filial independence. Yet, for all this, Bernard was\npleased with his position; and, as he walked with her through the\nlighted and crowded rooms, where they soon detached themselves from\ntheir companions, he felt that peculiar satisfaction which best\nexpresses itself in silence. Angela looked a while at the rows of still,\nattentive faces, fixed upon the luminous green circle, across which\nlittle heaps of louis d’or were being pushed to and fro, and she\ncontinued to say nothing. Then at last she exclaimed simply, “Come\naway!” They turned away and passed into another chamber, in which there\nwas no gambling. It was an immense apartment, apparently a ball-room;\nbut at present it was quite unoccupied. There were green velvet benches\nall around it, and a great polished floor stretched away, shining in the\nlight of chandeliers adorned with innumerable glass drops. Miss Vivian\nstood a moment on the threshold; then she passed in, and they stopped\nin the middle of the place, facing each other, and with their figures\nreflected as if they had been standing on a sheet of ice. There was no\none in the room; they were entirely alone.\n\n“Why don’t you recognize me?” Bernard murmured quickly.\n\n“Recognize you?”\n\n“Why do you seem to forget our meeting at Siena?”\n\nShe might have answered if she had answered immediately; but she\nhesitated, and while she did so something happened at the other end of\nthe room which caused her to shift her glance. A green velvet portiere\nsuspended in one of the door-ways--not that through which our\nfriends had passed--was lifted, and Gordon Wright stood there, holding\nit up, and looking at them. His companions were behind him.\n\n“Ah, here they are!” cried Gordon, in his loud, clear voice.\n\nThis appeared to strike Angela Vivian as an interruption, and Bernard\nsaw it very much in the same light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nHe forbore to ask her his question again--she might tell him at her\nconvenience. But the days passed by, and she never told him--she had\nher own reasons. Bernard talked with her very often; conversation formed\nindeed the chief entertainment of the quiet little circle of which\nhe was a member. They sat on the terrace and talked in the mingled\nstarlight and lamplight, and they strolled in the deep green forests and\nwound along the side of the gentle Baden hills, under the influence of\ncolloquial tendencies. The Black Forest is a country of almost unbroken\nshade, and in the still days of midsummer the whole place was covered\nwith a motionless canopy of verdure. Our friends were not extravagant\nor audacious people, and they looked at Baden life very much from the\noutside--they sat aloof from the brightly lighted drama of professional\nrevelry. Among themselves as well, however, a little drama went\nforward in which each member of the company had a part to play. Bernard\nLongueville had been surprised at first at what he would have called\nMiss Vivian’s approachableness--at the frequency with which he\nencountered opportunities for sitting near her and entering into\nconversation. He had expected that Gordon Wright would deem himself to\nhave established an anticipatory claim upon the young lady’s attention,\nand that, in pursuance of this claim, he would occupy a recognized place\nat her side. Gordon was, after all, wooing her; it was very natural\nhe should seek her society. In fact, he was never very far off; but\nBernard, for three or four days, had the anomalous consciousness of\nbeing still nearer. Presently, however, he perceived that he owed this\nprivilege simply to his friend’s desire that he should become acquainted\nwith Miss Vivian--should receive a vivid impression of a person in\nwhom Gordon was so deeply interested. After this result might have been\nsupposed to be attained, Gordon Wright stepped back into his usual place\nand showed her those small civilities which were the only homage that\nthe quiet conditions of their life rendered possible--walked with her,\ntalked with her, brought her a book to read, a chair to sit upon, a\ncouple of flowers to place in the bosom of her gown, treated her, in a\nword, with a sober but by no means inexpressive gallantry. He had\nnot been making violent love, as he told Longueville, and these\ndemonstrations were certainly not violent. Bernard said to himself\nthat if he were not in the secret, a spectator would scarcely make the\ndiscovery that Gordon cherished an even very safely tended flame. Angela\nVivian, on her side, was not strikingly responsive. There was nothing\nin her deportment to indicate that she was in love with her systematic\nsuitor. She was perfectly gracious and civil. She smiled in his face\nwhen he shook hands with her; she looked at him and listened when he\ntalked; she let him stroll beside her in the Lichtenthal Alley; she\nread, or appeared to read, the books he lent her, and she decorated\nherself with the flowers he offered. She seemed neither bored nor\nembarrassed, neither irritated nor oppressed. But it was Bernard’s\nbelief that she took no more pleasure in his attentions than a pretty\ngirl must always take in any recognition of her charms. “If she ‘s\nnot indifferent,” he said to himself, “she is, at any rate,\nimpartial--profoundly impartial.”\n\nIt was not till the end of a week that Gordon Wright told him exactly\nhow his business stood with Miss Vivian and what he had reason to expect\nand hope--a week during which their relations had been of the happiest\nand most comfortable cast, and during which Bernard, rejoicing in\ntheir long walks and talks, in the charming weather, in the beauty and\nentertainment of the place, and in other things besides, had not ceased\nto congratulate himself on coming to Baden. Bernard, after the first\nday, had asked his friend no questions. He had a great respect for\nopportunity, coming either to others or to himself, and he left Gordon\nto turn his lantern as fitfully as might be upon the subject which was\ntacitly open between them, but of which as yet only the mere edges had\nemerged into light. Gordon, on his side, seemed content for the moment\nwith having his clever friend under his hand; he reserved him for final\nappeal or for some other mysterious use.\n\n“You can’t tell me you don’t know her now,” he said, one evening as the\ntwo young men strolled along the Lichtenthal Alley--“now that you have\nhad a whole week’s observation of her.”\n\n“What is a week’s observation of a singularly clever and complicated\nwoman?” Bernard asked.\n\n“Ah, your week has been of some use. You have found out she is\ncomplicated!” Gordon rejoined.\n\n“My dear Gordon,” Longueville exclaimed, “I don’t see what it signifies\nto you that I should find Miss Vivian out! When a man ‘s in love, what\nneed he care what other people think of the loved object?”\n\n“It would certainly be a pity to care too much. But there is some excuse\nfor him in the loved object being, as you say, complicated.”\n\n“Nonsense! That ‘s no excuse. The loved object is always complicated.”\n\nGordon walked on in silence a moment.\n\n“Well, then, I don’t care a button what you think!”\n\n“Bravo! That ‘s the way a man should talk,” cried Longueville.\n\nGordon indulged in another fit of meditation, and then he said--\n\n“Now that leaves you at liberty to say what you please.”\n\n“Ah, my dear fellow, you are ridiculous!” said Bernard.\n\n“That ‘s precisely what I want you to say. You always think me too\nreasonable.”\n\n“Well, I go back to my first assertion. I don’t know Miss Vivian--I mean\nI don’t know her to have opinions about her. I don’t suppose you wish\nme to string you off a dozen mere banalites--‘She ‘s a charming\ngirl--evidently a superior person--has a great deal of style.’”\n\n“Oh no,” said Gordon; “I know all that. But, at any rate,” he added,\n“you like her, eh?”\n\n“I do more,” said Longueville. “I admire her.”\n\n“Is that doing more?” asked Gordon, reflectively.\n\n“Well, the greater, whichever it is, includes the less.”\n\n“You won’t commit yourself,” said Gordon. “My dear Bernard,” he added,\n“I thought you knew such an immense deal about women!”\n\nGordon Wright was of so kindly and candid a nature that it is hardly\nconceivable that this remark should have been framed to make Bernard\ncommit himself by putting him on his mettle. Such a view would imply\nindeed on Gordon’s part a greater familiarity with the uses of irony\nthan he had ever possessed, as well as a livelier conviction of the\nirritable nature of his friend’s vanity. In fact, however, it may be\nconfided to the reader that Bernard was pricked in a tender place,\nthough the resentment of vanity was not visible in his answer.\n\n“You were quite wrong,” he simply said. “I am as ignorant of women as a\nmonk in his cloister.”\n\n“You try to prove too much. You don’t think her sympathetic!” And as\nregards this last remark, Gordon Wright must be credited with a certain\nironical impulse.\n\nBernard stopped impatiently.\n\n“I ask you again, what does it matter to you what I think of her?”\n\n“It matters in this sense--that she has refused me.”\n\n“Refused you? Then it is all over, and nothing matters.”\n\n“No, it is n’t over,” said Gordon, with a positive head-shake. “Don’t\nyou see it is n’t over?”\n\nBernard smiled, laid his hand on his friend’s shoulder and patted it a\nlittle.\n\n“Your attitude might almost pass for that of resignation.”\n\n“I ‘m not resigned!” said Gordon Wright.\n\n“Of course not. But when were you refused?”\n\nGordon stood a minute with his eyes fixed on the ground. Then, at last\nlooking up,\n\n“Three weeks ago--a fortnight before you came. But let us walk along,”\n he said, “and I will tell you all about it.”\n\n“I proposed to her three weeks ago,” said Gordon, as they walked along.\n“My heart was very much set upon it. I was very hard hit--I was deeply\nsmitten. She had been very kind to me--she had been charming--I thought\nshe liked me. Then I thought her mother was pleased, and would have\nliked it. Mrs. Vivian, in fact, told me as much; for of course I spoke\nto her first. Well, Angela does like me--or at least she did--and I see\nno reason to suppose she has changed. Only she did n’t like me enough.\nShe said the friendliest and pleasantest things to me, but she thought\nthat she knew me too little, and that I knew her even less. She made a\ngreat point of that--that I had no right, as yet, to trust her. I told\nher that if she would trust me, I was perfectly willing to trust her;\nbut she answered that this was poor reasoning. She said that I was\ntrustworthy and that she was not, and--in short, all sorts of nonsense.\nShe abused herself roundly--accused herself of no end of defects.”\n\n“What defects, for instance?”\n\n“Oh, I have n’t remembered them. She said she had a bad temper--that\nshe led her mother a dreadful life. Now, poor Mrs. Vivian says she is an\nangel.”\n\n“Ah yes,” Bernard observed; “Mrs. Vivian says that, very freely.”\n\n“Angela declared that she was jealous, ungenerous, unforgiving--all\nsorts of things. I remember she said ‘I am very false,’ and I think she\nremarked that she was cruel.”\n\n“But this did n’t put you off,” said Bernard.\n\n“Not at all. She was making up.”\n\n“She makes up very well!” Bernard exclaimed, laughing.\n\n“Do you call that well?”\n\n“I mean it was very clever.”\n\n“It was not clever from the point of view of wishing to discourage me.”\n\n“Possibly. But I am sure,” said Bernard, “that if I had been present at\nyour interview--excuse the impudence of the hypothesis--I should have\nbeen struck with the young lady’s--” and he paused a moment.\n\n“With her what?”\n\n“With her ability.”\n\n“Well, her ability was not sufficient to induce me to give up my idea.\nShe told me that after I had known her six months I should detest her.”\n\n“I have no doubt she could make you do it if she should try. That ‘s\nwhat I mean by her ability.”\n\n“She calls herself cruel,” said Gordon, “but she has not had the cruelty\nto try. She has been very reasonable--she has been perfect. I agreed\nwith her that I would drop the subject for a while, and that meanwhile\nwe should be good friends. We should take time to know each other better\nand act in accordance with further knowledge. There was no hurry, since\nwe trusted each other--wrong as my trust might be. She had no wish that\nI should go away. I was not in the least disagreeable to her; she liked\nme extremely, and I was perfectly free to try and please her. Only I\nshould drop my proposal, and be free to take it up again or leave it\nalone, later, as I should choose. If she felt differently then, I should\nhave the benefit of it, and if I myself felt differently, I should also\nhave the benefit of it.”\n\n“That ‘s a very comfortable arrangement. And that ‘s your present\nsituation?” asked Bernard.\n\nGordon hesitated a moment.\n\n“More or less, but not exactly.”\n\n“Miss Vivian feels differently?” said Bernard.\n\n“Not that I know of.”\n\nGordon’s companion, with a laugh, clapped him on the shoulder again.\n\n“Admirable youth, you are a capital match!”\n\n“Are you alluding to my money?”\n\n“To your money and to your modesty. There is as much of one as of the\nother--which is saying a great deal.”\n\n“Well,” said Gordon, “in spite of that enviable combination, I am not\nhappy.”\n\n“I thought you seemed pensive!” Bernard exclaimed. “It ‘s you, then, who\nfeel differently.”\n\nGordon gave a sigh.\n\n“To say that is to say too much.”\n\n“What shall we say, then?” his companion asked, kindly.\n\nGordon stopped again; he stood there looking up at a certain\nparticularly lustrous star which twinkled--the night was cloudy--in an\nopen patch of sky, and the vague brightness shone down on his honest and\nserious visage.\n\n“I don’t understand her,” he said.\n\n“Oh, I ‘ll say that with you any day!” cried Bernard. “I can’t help you\nthere.”\n\n“You must help me;” and Gordon Wright deserted his star. “You must keep\nme in good humor.”\n\n“Please to walk on, then. I don’t in the least pity you; she is very\ncharming with you.”\n\n“True enough; but insisting on that is not the way to keep me in good\nhumor--when I feel as I do.”\n\n“How is it you feel?”\n\n“Puzzled to death--bewildered--depressed!”\n\nThis was but the beginning of Gordon Wright’s list; he went on to say\nthat though he “thought as highly” of Miss Vivian as he had ever done,\nhe felt less at his ease with her than in the first weeks of their\nacquaintance, and this condition made him uncomfortable and unhappy.\n\n“I don’t know what ‘s the matter,” said poor Gordon. “I don’t know what\nhas come between us. It is n’t her fault--I don’t make her responsible\nfor it. I began to notice it about a fortnight ago--before you came;\nshortly after that talk I had with her that I have just described to\nyou. Her manner has n’t changed and I have no reason to suppose that\nshe likes me any the less; but she makes a strange impression on me--she\nmakes me uneasy. It ‘s only her nature coming out, I suppose--what you\nmight call her originality. She ‘s thoroughly original--she ‘s a kind\nof mysterious creature. I suppose that what I feel is a sort of\nfascination; but that is just what I don’t like. Hang it, I don’t want\nto be fascinated--I object to being fascinated!”\n\nThis little story had taken some time in the telling, so that the two\nyoung men had now reached their hotel.\n\n“Ah, my dear Gordon,” said Bernard, “we speak a different language. If\nyou don’t want to be fascinated, what is one to say to you? ‘Object to\nbeing fascinated!’ There ‘s a man easy to satisfy! Raffine, va!”\n\n“Well, see here now,” said Gordon, stopping in the door-way of the inn;\n“when it comes to the point, do you like it yourself?”\n\n“When it comes to the point?” Bernard exclaimed. “I assure you I don’t\nwait till then. I like the beginning--I delight in the approach of it--I\nrevel in the prospect.”\n\n“That’s just what I did. But now that the thing has come--I don’t revel.\nTo be fascinated is to be mystified. Damn it, I like my liberty--I like\nmy judgment!”\n\n“So do I--like yours,” said Bernard, laughing, as they took their\nbedroom candles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nBernard talked of this matter rather theoretically, inasmuch as to\nhis own sense, he was in a state neither of incipient nor of absorbed\nfascination. He got on very easily, however, with Angela Vivian, and\nfelt none of the mysterious discomfort alluded to by his friend. The\nelement of mystery attached itself rather to the young lady’s mother,\nwho gave him the impression that for undiscoverable reasons she avoided\nhis society. He regretted her evasive deportment, for he found something\nagreeable in this shy and scrupulous little woman, who struck him as a\ncurious specimen of a society of which he had once been very fond. He\nlearned that she was of old New England stock, but he had not needed\nthis information to perceive that Mrs. Vivian was animated by the genius\nof Boston. “She has the Boston temperament,” he said, using a\nphrase with which he had become familiar and which evoked a train of\nassociations. But then he immediately added that if Mrs. Vivian was a\ndaughter of the Puritans, the Puritan strain in her disposition had\nbeen mingled with another element. “It is the Boston temperament\nsophisticated,” he said; “perverted a little--perhaps even corrupted.\nIt is the local east-wind with an infusion from climates less tonic.” It\nseemed to him that Mrs. Vivian was a Puritan grown worldly--a Bostonian\nrelaxed; and this impression, oddly enough, contributed to his wish to\nknow more of her. He felt like going up to her very politely and saying,\n“Dear lady and most honored compatriot, what in the world have I done\nto displease you? You don’t approve of me, and I am dying to know the\nreason why. I should be so happy to exert myself to be agreeable to you.\nIt ‘s no use; you give me the cold shoulder. When I speak to you, you\nlook the other way; it is only when I speak to your daughter that you\nlook at me. It is true that at those times you look at me very hard, and\nif I am not greatly mistaken, you are not gratified by what you see.\nYou count the words I address to your beautiful Angela--you time our\nharmless little interviews. You interrupt them indeed whenever you can;\nyou call her away--you appeal to her; you cut across the conversation.\nYou are always laying plots to keep us apart. Why can’t you leave me\nalone? I assure you I am the most innocent of men. Your beautiful Angela\ncan’t possibly be injured by my conversation, and I have no designs\nwhatever upon her peace of mind. What on earth have I done to offend\nyou?”\n\nThese observations Bernard Longueville was disposed to make, and one\nafternoon, the opportunity offering, they rose to his lips and came very\nnear passing them. In fact, however, at the last moment, his eloquence\ntook another turn. It was the custom of the orchestra at the Kursaal\nto play in the afternoon, and as the music was often good, a great many\npeople assembled under the trees, at three o’clock, to listen to it.\nThis was not, as a regular thing, an hour of re-union for the little\ngroup in which we are especially interested; Miss Vivian, in particular,\nunless an excursion of some sort had been agreed upon the day before,\nwas usually not to be seen in the precincts of the Conversation-house\nuntil the evening. Bernard, one afternoon, at three o’clock, directed\nhis steps to this small world-centre of Baden, and, passing along the\nterrace, soon encountered little Blanche Evers strolling there under a\npink parasol and accompanied by Captain Lovelock. This young lady was\nalways extremely sociable; it was quite in accordance with her habitual\ngeniality that she should stop and say how d’ ye do to our hero.\n\n“Mr. Longueville is growing very frivolous,” she said, “coming to the\nKursaal at all sorts of hours.”\n\n“There is nothing frivolous in coming here with the hope of finding\nyou,” the young man answered. “That is very serious.”\n\n“It would be more serious to lose Miss Evers than to find her,” remarked\nCaptain Lovelock, with gallant jocosity.\n\n“I wish you would lose me!” cried the young girl. “I think I should like\nto be lost. I might have all kinds of adventures.”\n\n“I ‘guess’ so!” said Captain Lovelock, hilariously.\n\n“Oh, I should find my way. I can take care of myself!” Blanche went on.\n\n“Mrs. Vivian does n’t think so,” said Bernard, who had just perceived\nthis lady, seated under a tree with a book, over the top of which she\nwas observing her pretty protege. Blanche looked toward her and gave her\na little nod and a smile. Then chattering on to the young men--\n\n“She ‘s awfully careful. I never saw any one so careful. But I\nsuppose she is right. She promised my mother she would be tremendously\nparticular; but I don’t know what she thinks I would do.”\n\n“That is n’t flattering to me,” said Captain Lovelock. “Mrs. Vivian\ndoes n’t approve of me--she wishes me in Jamaica. What does she think me\ncapable of?”\n\n“And me, now?” Bernard asked. “She likes me least of all, and I, on my\nside, think she ‘s so nice.”\n\n“Can’t say I ‘m very sweet on her,” said the Captain. “She strikes me as\nfeline.”\n\nBlanche Evers gave a little cry of horror.\n\n“Stop, sir, this instant! I won’t have you talk that way about a lady\nwho has been so kind to me.”\n\n“She is n’t so kind to you. She would like to lock you up where I can\nnever see you.”\n\n“I ‘m sure I should n’t mind that!” cried the young girl, with a\nlittle laugh and a toss of her head. “Mrs. Vivian has the most perfect\ncharacter--that ‘s why my mother wanted me to come with her. And if she\npromised my mother she would be careful, is n’t she right to keep her\npromise? She ‘s a great deal more careful than mamma ever was, and that\n‘s just what mamma wanted. She would never take the trouble herself. And\nthen she was always scolding me. Mrs. Vivian never scolds me. She only\nwatches me, but I don’t mind that.”\n\n“I wish she would watch you a little less and scold you a little more,”\n said Captain Lovelock.\n\n“I have no doubt you wish a great many horrid things,” his companion\nrejoined, with delightful asperity.\n\n“Ah, unfortunately I never have anything I wish!” sighed Lovelock.\n\n“Your wishes must be comprehensive,” said Bernard. “It seems to me you\nhave a good deal.”\n\nThe Englishman gave a shrug.\n\n“It ‘s less than you might think. She is watching us more furiously than\never,” he added, in a moment, looking at Mrs. Vivian. “Mr. Gordon Wright\nis the only man she likes. She is awfully fond of Mr. Gordon Wright.”\n\n“Ah, Mrs. Vivian shows her wisdom!” said Bernard.\n\n“He is certainly very handsome,” murmured Blanche Evers, glancing\nseveral times, with a very pretty aggressiveness, at Captain Lovelock.\n“I must say I like Mr. Gordon Wright. Why in the world did you come here\nwithout him?” she went on, addressing herself to Bernard. “You two are\nso awfully inseparable. I don’t think I ever saw you alone before.”\n\n“Oh, I have often seen Mr. Gordon Wright alone,” said Captain\nLovelock--“that is, alone with Miss Vivian. That ‘s what the old lady\nlikes; she can’t have too much of that.”\n\nThe young girl, poised for an instant in one of her pretty attitudes,\nlooked at him from head to foot.\n\n“Well, I call that scandalous! Do you mean that she wants to make a\nmatch?”\n\n“I mean that the young man has six thousand a year.”\n\n“It ‘s no matter what he has--six thousand a year is n’t much! And we\ndon’t do things in that way in our country. We have n’t those horrid\nmatch-making arrangements that you have in your dreadful country.\nAmerican mothers are not like English mothers.”\n\n“Oh, any one can see, of course,” said Captain Lovelock, “that Mr.\nGordon Wright is dying of love for Miss Vivian.”\n\n“I can’t see it!” cried Blanche.\n\n“He dies easier than I, eh?”\n\n“I wish you would die!” said Blanche. “At any rate, Angela is not dying\nof love for Mr. Wright.”\n\n“Well, she will marry him all the same,” Lovelock declared.\n\nBlanche Evers glanced at Bernard.\n\n“Why don’t you contradict that?” she asked. “Why don’t you speak up for\nyour friend?”\n\n“I am quite ready to speak for my friend,” said Bernard, “but I am not\nready to speak for Miss Vivian.”\n\n“Well, I am,” Blanche declared. “She won’t marry him.”\n\n“If she does n’t, I ‘ll eat my hat!” said Captain Lovelock. “What do\nyou mean,” he went on, “by saying that in America a pretty girl’s mother\ndoes n’t care for a young fellow’s property?”\n\n“Well, they don’t--we consider that dreadful. Why don’t you say so,\nMr. Longueville?” Blanche demanded. “I never saw any one take things so\nquietly. Have n’t you got any patriotism?”\n\n“My patriotism is modified by an indisposition to generalize,” said\nBernard, laughing. “On this point permit me not to generalize. I am\ninterested in the particular case--in ascertaining whether Mrs. Vivian\nthinks very often of Gordon Wright’s income.”\n\nMiss Evers gave a little toss of disgust.\n\n“If you are so awfully impartial, you had better go and ask her.”\n\n“That ‘s a good idea--I think I will go and ask her,” said Bernard.\n\nCaptain Lovelock returned to his argument.\n\n“Do you mean to say that your mother would be indifferent to the fact\nthat I have n’t a shilling in the world?”\n\n“Indifferent?” Blanche demanded. “Oh no, she would be sorry for you. She\nis very charitable--she would give you a shilling!”\n\n“She would n’t let you marry me,” said Lovelock.\n\n“She would n’t have much trouble to prevent it!” cried the young girl.\n\nBernard had had enough of this intellectual fencing.\n\n“Yes, I will go and ask Mrs. Vivian,” he repeated. And he left his\ncompanions to resume their walk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nIt had seemed to him a good idea to interrogate Mrs. Vivian; but there\nare a great many good ideas that are never put into execution. As he\napproached her with a smile and a salutation, and, with the air of\nasking leave to take a liberty, seated himself in the empty chair beside\nher, he felt a humorous relish of her own probable dismay which relaxed\nthe investigating impulse. His impulse was now simply to prove to her\nthat he was the most unobjectionable fellow in the world--a proposition\nwhich resolved itself into several ingenious observations upon the\nweather, the music, the charms and the drawbacks of Baden, the merits of\nthe volume that she held in her lap. If Mrs. Vivian should be annoyed,\nshould be fluttered, Bernard would feel very sorry for her; there was\nnothing in the world that he respected more than the moral consciousness\nof a little Boston woman whose view of life was serious and whose\nimagination was subject to alarms. He held it to be a temple of\ndelicacy, where one should walk on tiptoe, and he wished to exhibit\nto Mrs. Vivian the possible lightness of his own step. She herself\nwas incapable of being rude or ungracious, and now that she was fairly\nconfronted with the plausible object of her mistrust, she composed\nherself to her usual attitude of refined liberality. Her book was a\nvolume of Victor Cousin.\n\n“You must have an extraordinary power of abstracting your mind,” Bernard\nsaid to her, observing it. “Studying philosophy at the Baden Kursaal\nstrikes me as a real intellectual feat.”\n\n“Don’t you think we need a little philosophy here?”\n\n“By all means--what we bring with us. But I should n’t attempt the use\nof the text-book on the spot.”\n\n“You should n’t speak of yourself as if you were not clever,” said Mrs.\nVivian. “Every one says you are so very clever.”\n\nLongueville stared; there was an unexpectedness in the speech and an\nincongruity in Mrs. Vivian’s beginning to flatter him. He needed\nto remind himself that if she was a Bostonian, she was a Bostonian\nperverted.\n\n“Ah, my dear madam, every one is no one,” he said, laughing.\n\n“It was Mr. Wright, in particular,” she rejoined. “He has always told us\nthat.”\n\n“He is blinded by friendship.”\n\n“Ah yes, we know about your friendship,” said Mrs. Vivian. “He has told\nus about that.”\n\n“You are making him out a terrible talker!”\n\n“We think he talks so well--we are so very fond of his conversation.”\n\n“It ‘s usually excellent,” said Bernard. “But it depends a good deal on\nthe subject.”\n\n“Oh,” rejoined Mrs. Vivian, “we always let him choose his subjects.” And\ndropping her eyes as if in sudden reflection, she began to smooth down\nthe crumpled corner of her volume.\n\nIt occurred to Bernard that--by some mysterious impulse--she was\nsuddenly presenting him with a chance to ask her the question that\nBlanche Evers had just suggested. Two or three other things as well\noccurred to him. Captain Lovelock had been struck with the fact that she\nfavored Gordon Wright’s addresses to her daughter, and Captain Lovelock\nhad a grotesque theory that she had set her heart upon seeing this young\nlady come into six thousand a year. Miss Evers’s devoted swain had never\nstruck Bernard as a brilliant reasoner, but our friend suddenly found\nhimself regarding him as one of the inspired. The form of depravity into\nwhich the New England conscience had lapsed on Mrs. Vivian’s part was\nan undue appreciation of a possible son-in-law’s income! In this\nilluminating discovery everything else became clear. Mrs. Vivian\ndisliked her humble servant because he had not thirty thousand dollars\na year, and because at a moment when it was Angela’s prime duty to\nconcentrate her thoughts upon Gordon Wright’s great advantages, a clever\nyoung man of paltry fortune was a superfluous diversion.\n\n“When you say clever, everything is relative,” he presently observed.\n“Now, there is Captain Lovelock; he has a certain kind of cleverness; he\nis very observant.”\n\nMrs. Vivian glanced up with a preoccupied air.\n\n“We don’t like Captain Lovelock,” she said.\n\n“I have heard him say capital things,” Bernard answered.\n\n“We think him brutal,” said Mrs. Vivian. “Please don’t praise Captain\nLovelock.”\n\n“Oh, I only want to be just.”\n\nMrs. Vivian for a moment said nothing.\n\n“Do you want very much to be just?” she presently asked.\n\n“It ‘s my most ardent desire.”\n\n“I ‘m glad to hear that--and I can easily believe it,” said Mrs. Vivian.\n\nBernard gave her a grateful smile, but while he smiled, he asked himself\na serious question. “Why the deuce does she go on flattering me?--You\nhave always been very kind to me,” he said aloud.\n\n“It ‘s on Mr. Wright’s account,” she answered demurely.\n\nIn speaking the words I have just quoted, Bernard Longueville had felt\nhimself, with a certain compunction, to be skirting the edge of clever\nimpudence; but Mrs. Vivian’s quiet little reply suggested to him that\nher cleverness, if not her impudence, was almost equal to his own. He\nremarked to himself that he had not yet done her justice.\n\n“You bring everything back to Gordon Wright,” he said, continuing to\nsmile.\n\nMrs. Vivian blushed a little.\n\n“It is because he is really at the foundation of everything that is\npleasant for us here. When we first came we had some very disagreeable\nrooms, and as soon as he arrived he found us some excellent ones--that\nwere less expensive. And then, Mr. Longueville,” she added, with a\nsoft, sweet emphasis which should properly have contradicted the idea\nof audacity, but which, to Bernard’s awakened sense, seemed really to\nimpart a vivid color to it, “he was also the cause of your joining our\nlittle party.”\n\n“Oh, among his services that should never be forgotten. You should set\nup a tablet to commemorate it, in the wall of the Kursaal!--The wicked\nlittle woman!” Bernard mentally subjoined.\n\nMrs. Vivian appeared quite unruffled by his sportive sarcasm, and she\ncontinued to enumerate her obligations to Gordon Wright.\n\n“There are so many ways in which a gentleman can be of assistance to\nthree poor lonely women, especially when he is at the same time so\nfriendly and so delicate as Mr. Wright. I don’t know what we should have\ndone without him, and I feel as if every one ought to know it. He seems\nlike a very old friend. My daughter and I quite worship him. I will not\nconceal from you that when I saw you coming through the grounds a short\ntime ago without him I was very much disappointed. I hope he is not\nill.”\n\nBernard sat listening, with his eyes on the ground.\n\n“Oh no, he is simply at home writing letters.”\n\nMrs. Vivian was silent a moment.\n\n“I suppose he has a very large correspondence.”\n\n“I really don’t know. Just now that I am with him he has a smaller one\nthan usual.”\n\n“Ah yes. When you are separated I suppose you write volumes to each\nother. But he must have a great many business letters.”\n\n“It is very likely,” said Bernard. “And if he has, you may be sure he\nwrites them.”\n\n“Order and method!” Mrs. Vivian exclaimed. “With his immense property\nthose virtues are necessary.”\n\nBernard glanced at her a moment.\n\n“My dear Lovelock,” he said to himself, “you are not such a fool as you\nseem.--Gordon’s virtues are always necessary, doubtless,” he went on.\n“But should you say his property was immense?”\n\nMrs. Vivian made a delicate little movement of deprecation. “Oh, don’t\nask me to say! I know nothing about it; I only supposed he was rich.”\n\n“He is rich; but he is not a Croesus.”\n\n“Oh, you fashionable young men have a standard of luxury!” said Mrs.\nVivian, with a little laugh. “To a poverty-stricken widow such a fortune\nas Mr. Wright’s seems magnificent.”\n\n“Don’t call me such horrible names!” exclaimed Bernard. “Our friend has\ncertainly money enough and to spare.”\n\n“That was all I meant. He once had occasion to allude to his property,\nbut he was so modest, so reserved in the tone he took about it, that one\nhardly knew what to think.”\n\n“He is ashamed of being rich,” said Bernard. “He would be sure to\nrepresent everything unfavorably.”\n\n“That ‘s just what I thought!” This ejaculation was more eager than Mrs.\nVivian might have intended, but even had it been less so, Bernard was in\na mood to appreciate it. “I felt that we should make allowances for his\nmodesty. But it was in very good taste,” Mrs. Vivian added.\n\n“He ‘s a fortunate man,” said Bernard. “He gets credit for his good\ntaste--and he gets credit for the full figure of his income as well!”\n\n“Ah,” murmured Mrs. Vivian, rising lightly, as if to make her words\nappear more casual, “I don’t know the full figure of his income.”\n\nShe was turning away, and Bernard, as he raised his hat and separated\nfrom her, felt that it was rather cruel that he should let her go\nwithout enlightening her ignorance. But he said to himself that she knew\nquite enough. Indeed, he took a walk along the Lichtenthal Alley and\ncarried out this line of reflection. Whether or no Miss Vivian were in\nlove with Gordon Wright, her mother was enamored of Gordon’s fortune,\nand it had suddenly occurred to her that instead of treating the friend\nof her daughter’s suitor with civil mistrust, she would help her case\nbetter by giving him a hint of her state of mind and appealing to his\nsense of propriety. Nothing could be more natural than that Mrs. Vivian\nshould suppose that Bernard desired his friend’s success; for, as our\nthoughtful hero said to himself, what she had hitherto taken it into her\nhead to fear was not that Bernard should fall in love with her daughter,\nbut that her daughter should fall in love with him. Watering-place life\nis notoriously conducive to idleness of mind, and Bernard strolled for\nhalf an hour along the overarched avenue, glancing alternately at these\ntwo insupposable cases.\n\nA few days afterward, late in the evening, Gordon Wright came to his\nroom at the hotel.\n\n“I have just received a letter from my sister,” he said. “I am afraid I\nshall have to go away.”\n\n“Ah, I ‘m sorry for that,” said Bernard, who was so well pleased with\nthe actual that he desired no mutation.\n\n“I mean only for a short time,” Gordon explained. “My poor sister writes\nfrom England, telling me that my brother-in-law is suddenly obliged to\ngo home. She has decided not to remain behind, and they are to sail a\nfortnight hence. She wants very much to see me before she goes, and as I\ndon’t know when I shall see her again, I feel as if I ought to join\nher immediately and spend the interval with her. That will take about a\nfortnight.”\n\n“I appreciate the sanctity of family ties and I project myself into\nyour situation,” said Bernard. “On the other hand, I don’t envy you a\nbreathless journey from Baden to Folkestone.”\n\n“It ‘s the coming back that will be breathless,” exclaimed Gordon,\nsmiling.\n\n“You will certainly come back, then?”\n\n“Most certainly. Mrs. Vivian is to be here another month.”\n\n“I understand. Well, we shall miss you very much.”\n\nGordon Wright looked for a moment at his companion.\n\n“You will stay here, then? I am so glad of that.”\n\n“I was taking it for granted; but on reflection--what do you recommend?”\n\n“I recommend you to stay.”\n\n“My dear fellow, your word is law,” said Bernard.\n\n“I want you to take care of those ladies,” his friend went on. “I don’t\nlike to leave them alone.”\n\n“You are joking!” cried Bernard. “When did you ever hear of my ‘taking\ncare’ of any one? It ‘s as much as I can do to take care of myself.”\n\n“This is very easy,” said Gordon. “I simply want to feel that they have\na man about them.”\n\n“They will have a man at any rate--they have the devoted Lovelock.”\n\n“That ‘s just why I want them to have another. He has only an eye to\nMiss Evers, who, by the way, is extremely bored with him. You look after\nthe others. You have made yourself very agreeable to them, and they like\nyou extremely.”\n\n“Ah,” said Bernard, laughing, “if you are going to be coarse and\nflattering, I collapse. If you are going to titillate my vanity, I\nsuccumb.”\n\n“It won’t be so disagreeable,” Gordon observed, with an intention\nvaguely humorous.\n\n“Oh no, it won’t be disagreeable. I will go to Mrs. Vivian every\nmorning, hat in hand, for my orders.”\n\nGordon Wright, with his hands in his pockets and a meditative\nexpression, took several turns about the room.\n\n“It will be a capital chance,” he said, at last, stopping in front of\nhis companion.\n\n“A chance for what?”\n\n“A chance to arrive at a conclusion about my young friend.”\n\nBernard gave a gentle groan.\n\n“Are you coming back to that? Did n’t I arrive at a conclusion long ago?\nDid n’t I tell you she was a delightful girl?”\n\n“Do you call that a conclusion? The first comer could tell me that at\nthe end of an hour.”\n\n“Do you want me to invent something different?” Bernard asked. “I can’t\ninvent anything better.”\n\n“I don’t want you to invent anything. I only want you to observe her--to\nstudy her in complete independence. You will have her to yourself--my\nabsence will leave you at liberty. Hang it, sir,” Gordon declared, “I\nshould think you would like it!”\n\n“Damn it, sir, you ‘re delicious!” Bernard answered; and he broke into\nan irrepressible laugh. “I don’t suppose it ‘s for my pleasure that you\nsuggest the arrangement.”\n\nGordon took a turn about the room again.\n\n“No, it ‘s for mine. At least, it ‘s for my benefit.”\n\n“For your benefit?”\n\n“I have got all sorts of ideas--I told you the other day. They are all\nmixed up together and I want a fresh impression.”\n\n“My impressions are never fresh,” Bernard replied.\n\n“They would be if you had a little good-will--if you entered a little\ninto my dilemma.” The note of reproach was so distinct in these words\nthat Bernard stood staring. “You never take anything seriously,” his\ncompanion went on.\n\nBernard tried to answer as seriously as possible.\n\n“Your dilemma seems to me of all dilemmas the strangest.”\n\n“That may be; but different people take things differently. Don’t you\nsee,” Gordon went on with a sudden outbreak of passion--“don’t you\nsee that I am horribly divided in mind? I care immensely for Angela\nVivian--and yet--and yet--I am afraid of her.”\n\n“Afraid of her?”\n\n“I am afraid she ‘s cleverer than I--that she would be a difficult wife;\nthat she might do strange things.”\n\n“What sort of things?”\n\n“Well, that she might flirt, for instance.”\n\n“That ‘s not a thing for a man to fear.”\n\n“Not when he supposes his wife to be fond of him--no. But I don’t\nsuppose that--I have given that up. If I should induce Angela Vivian to\naccept me she would do it on grounds purely reasonable. She would think\nit best, simply. That would give her a chance to repent.”\n\nBernard sat for some time looking at his friend.\n\n“You say she is cleverer than you. It ‘s impossible to be cleverer than\nyou.”\n\n“Oh, come, Longueville!” said Gordon, angrily.\n\n“I am speaking very seriously. You have done a remarkably clever thing.\nYou have impressed me with the reality, and with--what shall I term\nit?--the estimable character of what you call your dilemma. Now this\nfresh impression of mine--what do you propose to do with it when you get\nit?”\n\n“Such things are always useful. It will be a good thing to have.”\n\n“I am much obliged to you; but do you propose to let anything depend\nupon it? Do you propose to take or to leave Miss Vivian--that is, to\nreturn to the charge or to give up trying--in consequence of my fresh\nimpression?”\n\nGordon seemed perfectly unembarrassed by this question, in spite of the\nironical light which it projected upon his sentimental perplexity.\n\n“I propose to do what I choose!” he said.\n\n“That ‘s a relief to me,” Bernard rejoined. “This idea of yours is,\nafter all, only the play of the scientific mind.”\n\n“I shall contradict you flat if I choose,” Gordon went on.\n\n“Ah, it ‘s well to warn me of that,” said Bernard, laughing. “Even the\nmost sincere judgment in the world likes to be notified a little of the\ndanger of being contradicted.”\n\n“Is yours the most sincere judgment in the world?” Gordon demanded.\n\n“That ‘s a very pertinent question. Does n’t it occur to you that you\nmay have reason to be jealous--leaving me alone, with an open field,\nwith the woman of your choice?”\n\n“I wish to heaven I could be jealous!” Gordon exclaimed. “That would\nsimplify the thing--that would give me a lift.”\n\nAnd the next day, after some more talk, it seemed really with a hope of\nthis contingency--though, indeed, he laughed about it--that he started\nfor England.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nFor the three or four days that followed Gordon Wright’s departure,\nBernard saw nothing of the ladies who had been committed to his charge.\nThey chose to remain in seclusion, and he was at liberty to interpret\nthis fact as an expression of regret at the loss of Gordon’s good\noffices. He knew other people at Baden, and he went to see them and\nendeavored, by cultivating their society, to await in patience the\nre-appearance of Mrs. Vivian and her companions. But on the fourth day\nhe became conscious that other people were much less interesting than\nthe trio of American ladies who had lodgings above the confectioner’s,\nand he made bold to go and knock at their door. He had been asked to\ntake care of them, and this function presupposed contact. He had\nmet Captain Lovelock the day before, wandering about with a rather\ncrest-fallen aspect, and the young Englishman had questioned him eagerly\nas to the whereabouts of Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“Gad, I believe they ‘ve left the place--left the place without giving a\nfellow warning!” cried Lovelock.\n\n“Oh no, I think they are here still,” said Bernard. “My friend Wright\nhas gone away for a week or two, but I suspect the ladies are simply\nstaying at home.”\n\n“Gad, I was afraid your friend Wright had taken them away with him; he\nseems to keep them all in his pocket. I was afraid he had given them\nmarching orders; they ‘d have been sure to go--they ‘re so awfully fond\nof his pocket! I went to look them up yesterday--upon my word I did.\nThey live at a baker’s in a little back-street; people do live in rum\nplaces when they come abroad! But I assure you, when I got there, I ‘m\ndamned if I could make out whether they were there or not. I don’t speak\na word of German, and there was no one there but the baker’s wife. She\nwas a low brute of a woman--she could n’t understand a word I said,\nthough she gave me plenty of her own tongue. I had to give it up. They\nwere not at home, but whether they had left Baden or not--that was\nbeyond my finding out. If they are here, why the deuce don’t they show?\nFancy coming to Baden-Baden to sit moping at a pastry-cook’s!”\n\nCaptain Lovelock was evidently irritated, and it was Bernard’s\nimpression that the turn of luck over yonder where the gold-pieces were\nchinking had something to do with the state of his temper. But more\nfortunate himself, he ascertained from the baker’s wife that though Mrs.\nVivian and her daughter had gone out, their companion, “the youngest\nlady--the little young lady”--was above in the sitting-room.\n\nBlanche Evers was sitting at the window with a book, but she\nrelinquished the volume with an alacrity that showed it had not been\nabsorbing, and began to chatter with her customary frankness.\n\n“Well, I must say I am glad to see some one!” cried the young girl,\npassing before the mirror and giving a touch to her charming tresses.\n\n“Even if it ‘s only me,” Bernard exclaimed, laughing.\n\n“I did n’t mean that. I am sure I am very glad to see you--I should\nthink you would have found out that by this time. I mean I ‘m glad to\nsee any one--especially a man. I suppose it ‘s improper for me to say\nthat--especially to you! There--you see I do think more of you than of\nsome gentlemen. Why especially to you? Well, because you always seem to\nme to want to take advantage. I did n’t say a base advantage; I did n’t\naccuse you of anything dreadful. I ‘m sure I want to take advantage,\ntoo--I take it whenever I can. You see I take advantage of your being\nhere--I ‘ve got so many things to say. I have n’t spoken a word in three\ndays, and I ‘m sure it is a pleasant change--a gentleman’s visit. All of\na sudden we have gone into mourning; I ‘m sure I don’t know who ‘s dead.\nIs it Mr. Gordon Wright? It ‘s some idea of Mrs. Vivian’s--I ‘m sure\nit is n’t mine. She thinks we have been often enough to the Kursaal. I\ndon’t know whether she thinks it ‘s wicked, or what. If it ‘s wicked the\nharm ‘s already done; I can’t be any worse than I am now. I have seen\nall the improper people and I have learnt all their names; Captain\nLovelock has told me their names, plenty of times. I don’t see what good\nit does me to be shut up here with all those names running in my ears.\nI must say I do prefer society. We have n’t been to the Kursaal for\nfour days--we have only gone out for a drive. We have taken the most\ninterminable drives. I do believe we have seen every old ruin in\nthe whole country. Mrs. Vivian and Angela are so awfully fond of\nscenery--they talk about it by the half-hour. They talk about the\nmountains and trees as if they were people they knew--as if they were\ngentlemen! I mean as if the mountains and trees were gentlemen. Of\ncourse scenery ‘s lovely, but you can’t walk about with a tree. At any\nrate, that has been all our society--foliage! Foliage and women; but I\nsuppose women are a sort of foliage. They are always rustling about and\ndropping off. That ‘s why I could n’t make up my mind to go out\nwith them this afternoon. They ‘ve gone to see the Waterworths--the\nWaterworths arrived yesterday and are staying at some hotel. Five\ndaughters--all unmarried! I don’t know what kind of foliage they are;\nsome peculiar kind--they don’t drop off. I thought I had had about\nenough ladies’ society--three women all sticking together! I don’t think\nit ‘s good for a young girl to have nothing but ladies’ society--it ‘s\nso awfully limited. I suppose I ought to stand up for my own sex and\ntell you that when we are alone together we want for nothing. But we\nwant for everything, as it happens! Women’s talk is limited--every one\nknows that. That ‘s just what mamma did n’t want when she asked Mrs.\nVivian to take charge of me. Now, Mr. Longueville, what are you laughing\nat?--you are always laughing at me. She wanted me to be unlimited--is\nthat what you say? Well, she did n’t want me to be narrowed down; she\nwanted me to have plenty of conversation. She wanted me to be fitted\nfor society--that ‘s what mamma wanted. She wanted me to have ease of\nmanner; she thinks that if you don’t acquire it when you are young you\nnever have it at all. She was so happy to think I should come to Baden;\nbut she would n’t approve of the life I ‘ve been leading the last four\ndays. That ‘s no way to acquire ease of manner--sitting all day in a\nsmall parlor with two persons of one’s own sex! Of course Mrs. Vivian’s\ninfluence--that ‘s the great thing. Mamma said it was like the odor of\na flower. But you don’t want to keep smelling a flower all day, even\nthe sweetest; that ‘s the shortest way to get a headache. Apropos of\nflowers, do you happen to have heard whether Captain Lovelock is alive\nor dead? Do I call him a flower? No; I call him a flower-pot. He always\nhas some fine young plant in his button-hole. He has n’t been near me\nthese ten years--I never heard of anything so rude!”\n\nCaptain Lovelock came on the morrow, Bernard finding him in Mrs.\nVivian’s little sitting-room on paying a second visit. On this occasion\nthe two other ladies were at home and Bernard was not exclusively\nindebted to Miss Evers for entertainment. It was to this source of\nhospitality, however, that Lovelock mainly appealed, following the\nyoung girl out upon the little balcony that was suspended above the\nconfectioner’s window. Mrs. Vivian sat writing at one of the windows of\nthe sitting-room, and Bernard addressed his conversation to Angela.\n\n“Wright requested me to keep an eye on you,” he said; “but you seem very\nmuch inclined to keep out of my jurisdiction.”\n\n“I supposed you had gone away,” she answered--“now that your friend is\ngone.”\n\n“By no means. Gordon is a charming fellow, but he is by no means the\nonly attraction of Baden. Besides, I have promised him to look after\nyou--to take care of you.”\n\nThe girl looked at him a moment in silence--a little askance.\n\n“I thought you had probably undertaken something of that sort,” she\npresently said.\n\n“It was of course a very natural request for Gordon to make.”\n\nAngela got up and turned away; she wandered about the room and went and\nstood at one of the windows. Bernard found the movement abrupt and\nnot particularly gracious; but the young man was not easy to snub. He\nfollowed her, and they stood at the second window--the long window that\nopened upon the balcony. Miss Evers and Captain Lovelock were leaning on\nthe railing, looking into the street and apparently amusing themselves\nhighly with what they saw.\n\n“I am not sure it was a natural request for him to make,” said Angela.\n\n“What could have been more so--devoted as he is to you?”\n\nShe hesitated a moment; then with a little laugh--\n\n“He ought to have locked us up and said nothing about it.”\n\n“It ‘s not so easy to lock you up,” said Bernard. “I know Wright has\ngreat influence with you, but you are after all independent beings.”\n\n“I am not an independent being. If my mother and Mr. Wright were to\nagree together to put me out of harm’s way they could easily manage it.”\n\n“You seem to have been trying something of that sort,” said Bernard.\n“You have been so terribly invisible.”\n\n“It was because I thought you had designs upon us; that you were\nwatching for us--to take care of us.”\n\n“You contradict yourself! You said just now that you believed I had left\nBaden.”\n\n“That was an artificial--a conventional speech. Is n’t a lady always\nsupposed to say something of that sort to a visitor by way of pretending\nto have noticed that she has not seen him?”\n\n“You know I would never have left Baden without coming to bid you\ngood-bye,” said Bernard.\n\nThe girl made no rejoinder; she stood looking out at the little sunny,\nslanting, rough-paved German street.\n\n“Are you taking care of us now?” she asked in a moment. “Has the\noperation begun? Have you heard the news, mamma?” she went on. “Do you\nknow that Mr. Wright has made us over to Mr. Longueville, to be kept\ntill called for? Suppose Mr. Wright should never call for us!”\n\nMrs. Vivian left her writing-table and came toward Bernard, smiling at\nhim and pressing her hands together.\n\n“There is no fear of that, I think,” she said. “I am sure I am very glad\nwe have a gentleman near us. I think you will be a very good care-taker,\nMr. Longueville, and I recommend my daughter to put great faith in\nyour judgment.” And Mrs. Vivian gave him an intense--a pleading, almost\naffecting--little smile.\n\n“I am greatly touched by your confidence and I shall do everything I can\nthink of to merit it,” said the young man.\n\n“Ah, mamma’s confidence is wonderful!” Angela exclaimed. “There was\nnever anything like mamma’s confidence. I am very different; I have no\nconfidence. And then I don’t like being deposited, like a parcel, or\nbeing watched, like a curious animal. I am too fond of my liberty.”\n\n“That is the second time you have contradicted yourself,” said Bernard.\n“You said just now that you were not an independent being.”\n\nAngela turned toward him quickly, smiling and frowning at once.\n\n“You do watch one, certainly! I see it has already begun.” Mrs. Vivian\nlaid her hand upon her daughter’s with a little murmur of tender\ndeprecation, and the girl bent over and kissed her. “Mamma will tell you\nit ‘s the effect of agitation,” she said--“that I am nervous, and don’t\nknow what I say. I am supposed to be agitated by Mr. Wright’s departure;\nis n’t that it, mamma?”\n\nMrs. Vivian turned away, with a certain soft severity.\n\n“I don’t know, my daughter. I don’t understand you.”\n\nA charming pink flush had come into Angela’s cheek and a noticeable\nlight into her eye. She looked admirably handsome, and Bernard frankly\ngazed at her. She met his gaze an instant, and then she went on.\n\n“Mr. Longueville does n’t understand me either. You must know that I am\nagitated,” she continued. “Every now and then I have moments of talking\nnonsense. It ‘s the air of Baden, I think; it ‘s too exciting. It\n‘s only lately I have been so. When you go away I shall be horribly\nashamed.”\n\n“If the air of Baden has such an effect upon you,” said Bernard, “it\nis only a proof the more that you need the solicitous attention of your\nfriends.”\n\n“That may be; but, as I told you just now, I have no confidence--none\nwhatever, in any one or anything. Therefore, for the present, I shall\nwithdraw from the world--I shall seclude myself. Let us go on being\nquiet, mamma. Three or four days of it have been so charming. Let the\nparcel lie till it ‘s called for. It is much safer it should n’t be\ntouched at all. I shall assume that, metaphorically speaking, Mr.\nWright, who, as you have intimated, is our earthly providence, has\nturned the key upon us. I am locked up. I shall not go out, except upon\nthe balcony!” And with this, Angela stepped out of the long window and\nwent and stood beside Miss Evers.\n\nBernard was extremely amused, but he was also a good deal puzzled, and\nit came over him that it was not a wonder that poor Wright should not\nhave found this young lady’s disposition a perfectly decipherable page.\nHe remained in the room with Mrs. Vivian--he stood there looking at\nher with his agreeably mystified smile. She had turned away, but on\nperceiving that her daughter had gone outside she came toward\nBernard again, with her habitual little air of eagerness mitigated by\ndiscretion. There instantly rose before his mind the vision of that\nmoment when he had stood face to face with this same apologetic mamma,\nafter Angela had turned her back, on the grass-grown terrace at Siena.\nTo make the vision complete, Mrs. Vivian took it into her head to utter\nthe same words.\n\n“I am sure you think she is a strange girl.”\n\nBernard recognized them, and he gave a light laugh.\n\n“You told me that the first time you ever saw me--in that quiet little\ncorner of an Italian town.”\n\nMrs. Vivian gave a little faded, elderly blush.\n\n“Don’t speak of that,” she murmured, glancing at the open window. “It\nwas a little accident of travel.”\n\n“I am dying to speak of it,” said Bernard. “It was such a charming\naccident for me! Tell me this, at least--have you kept my sketch?”\n\nMrs. Vivian colored more deeply and glanced at the window again.\n\n“No,” she just whispered.\n\nBernard looked out of the window too. Angela was leaning against the\nrailing of the balcony, in profile, just as she had stood while he\npainted her, against the polished parapet at Siena. The young man’s eyes\nrested on her a moment, then, as he glanced back at her mother:\n\n“Has she kept it?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Vivian, with decision.\n\nThe decision was excessive--it expressed the poor lady’s distress at\nhaving her veracity tested. “Dear little daughter of the Puritans--she\ncan’t tell a fib!” Bernard exclaimed to himself. And with this\nflattering conclusion he took leave of her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIt was affirmed at an early stage of this narrative that he was a young\nman of a contemplative and speculative turn, and he had perhaps never\nbeen more true to his character than during an hour or two that\nevening as he sat by himself on the terrace of the Conversation-house,\nsurrounded by the crowd of its frequenters, but lost in his meditations.\nThe place was full of movement and sound, but he had tilted back his\nchair against the great green box of an orange-tree, and in this easy\nattitude, vaguely and agreeably conscious of the music, he directed his\ngaze to the star-sprinkled vault of the night. There were people coming\nand going whom he knew, but he said nothing to any one--he preferred to\nbe alone; he found his own company quite absorbing. He felt very happy,\nvery much amused, very curiously preoccupied. The feeling was a singular\none. It partook of the nature of intellectual excitement. He had a\nsense of having received carte blanche for the expenditure of his wits.\nBernard liked to feel his intelligence at play; this is, perhaps, the\nhighest luxury of a clever man. It played at present over the whole\nfield of Angela Vivian’s oddities of conduct--for, since his visit in\nthe afternoon, Bernard had felt that the spectacle was considerably\nenlarged. He had come to feel, also, that poor Gordon’s predicament was\nby no means an unnatural one. Longueville had begun to take his friend’s\ndilemma very seriously indeed. The girl was certainly a curious study.\n\nThe evening drew to a close and the crowd of Bernard’s fellow-loungers\ndispersed. The lighted windows of the Kursaal still glittered in\nthe bosky darkness, and the lamps along the terrace had not been\nextinguished; but the great promenade was almost deserted; here and\nthere only a lingering couple--the red tip of a cigar and the vague\nradiance of a light dress--gave animation to the place. But Bernard\nsat there still in his tilted chair, beneath his orange-tree; his\nimagination had wandered very far and he was awaiting its return to the\nfold. He was on the point of rising, however, when he saw three figures\ncome down the empty vista of the terrace--figures which even at a\ndistance had a familiar air. He immediately left his seat and, taking\na dozen steps, recognized Angela Vivian, Blanche Evers and Captain\nLovelock. In a moment he met them in the middle of the terrace.\n\nBlanche immediately announced that they had come for a midnight walk.\n\n“And if you think it ‘s improper,” she exclaimed, “it ‘s not my\ninvention--it ‘s Miss Vivian’s.”\n\n“I beg pardon--it ‘s mine,” said Captain Lovelock. “I desire the credit\nof it. I started the idea; you never would have come without me.”\n\n“I think it would have been more proper to come without you than with\nyou,” Blanche declared. “You know you ‘re a dreadful character.”\n\n“I ‘m much worse when I ‘m away from you than when I ‘m with you,” said\nLovelock. “You keep me in order.”\n\nThe young girl gave a little cry.\n\n“I don’t know what you call order! You can’t be worse than you have been\nto-night.”\n\nAngela was not listening to this; she turned away a little, looking\nabout at the empty garden.\n\n“This is the third time to-day that you have contradicted yourself,” he\nsaid. Though he spoke softly he went nearer to her; but she appeared not\nto hear him--she looked away.\n\n“You ought to have been there, Mr. Longueville,” Blanche went on. “We\nhave had a most lovely night; we sat all the evening on Mrs. Vivian’s\nbalcony, eating ices. To sit on a balcony, eating ices--that ‘s my idea\nof heaven.”\n\n“With an angel by your side,” said Captain Lovelock.\n\n“You are not my idea of an angel,” retorted Blanche.\n\n“I ‘m afraid you ‘ll never learn what the angels are really like,” said\nthe Captain. “That ‘s why Miss Evers got Mrs. Vivian to take rooms over\nthe baker’s--so that she could have ices sent up several times a day.\nWell, I ‘m bound to say the baker’s ices are not bad.”\n\n“Considering that they have been baked! But they affect the mind,”\n Blanche went on. “They would have affected Captain Lovelock’s--only he\nhas n’t any. They certainly affected Angela’s--putting it into her head,\nat eleven o’clock, to come out to walk.”\n\nAngela did nothing whatever to defend herself against this ingenious\nsally; she simply stood there in graceful abstraction. Bernard was\nvaguely vexed at her neither looking at him nor speaking to him; her\nindifference seemed a contravention of that right of criticism which\nGordon had bequeathed to him.\n\n“I supposed people went to bed at eleven o’clock,” he said.\n\nAngela glanced about her, without meeting his eye.\n\n“They seem to have gone.”\n\nMiss Evers strolled on, and her Captain of course kept pace with her; so\nthat Bernard and Miss Vivian were left standing together. He looked at\nher a moment in silence, but her eye still avoided his own.\n\n“You are remarkably inconsistent,” Bernard presently said. “You take a\nsolemn vow of seclusion this afternoon, and no sooner have you taken it\nthan you proceed to break it in this outrageous manner.”\n\nShe looked at him now--a long time--longer than she had ever done\nbefore.\n\n“This is part of the examination, I suppose,” she said.\n\nBernard hesitated an instant.\n\n“What examination?”\n\n“The one you have undertaken--on Mr. Wright’s behalf.”\n\n“What do you know about that?”\n\n“Ah, you admit it then?” the girl exclaimed, with an eager laugh.\n\n“I don’t in the least admit it,” said Bernard, conscious only for the\nmoment of the duty of loyalty to his friend and feeling that negation\nhere was simply a point of honor.\n\n“I trust more to my own conviction than to your denial. You have engaged\nto bring your superior wisdom and your immense experience to bear upon\nme! That ‘s the understanding.”\n\n“You must think us a pretty pair of wiseacres,” said Bernard.\n\n“There it is--you already begin to answer for what I think. When Mr.\nWright comes back you will be able to tell him that I am ‘outrageous’!”\n And she turned away and walked on, slowly following her companions.\n\n“What do you care what I tell him?” Bernard asked. “You don’t care a\nstraw.”\n\nShe said nothing for a moment, then, suddenly, she stopped again,\ndropping her eyes.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” she said, very gently; “I care a great deal. It ‘s\nas well that you should know that.”\n\nBernard stood looking at her; her eyes were still lowered.\n\n“Do you know what I shall tell him? I shall tell him that about eleven\no’clock at night you become peculiarly attractive.”\n\nShe went on again a few steps; Miss Evers and Captain Lovelock had\nturned round and were coming toward her.\n\n“It is very true that I am outrageous,” she said; “it was extremely\nsilly and in very bad taste to come out at this hour. Mamma was not at\nall pleased, and I was very unkind to her. I only wanted to take a turn,\nand now we will go back.” On the others coming up she announced this\nresolution, and though Captain Lovelock and his companion made a\ngreat outcry, she carried her point. Bernard offered no opposition. He\ncontented himself with walking back to her mother’s lodging with her\nalmost in silence. The little winding streets were still and empty;\nthere was no sound but the chatter and laughter of Blanche and her\nattendant swain. Angela said nothing.\n\nThis incident presented itself at first to Bernard’s mind as a sort\nof declaration of war. The girl had guessed that she was to be made\na subject of speculative scrutiny. The idea was not agreeable to her\nindependent spirit, and she placed herself boldly on the defensive. She\ntook her stand upon her right to defeat his purpose by every possible\nmeans--to perplex, elude, deceive him--in plain English, to make a fool\nof him. This was the construction which for several days Bernard put\nupon her deportment, at the same time that he thought it immensely\nclever of her to have guessed what had been going on in his mind. She\nmade him feel very much ashamed of his critical attitude, and he did\neverything he could think of to put her off her guard and persuade her\nthat for the moment he had ceased to be an observer. His position at\nmoments seemed to him an odious one, for he was firmly resolved that\nbetween him and the woman to whom his friend had proposed there should\nbe nothing in the way of a vulgar flirtation. Under the circumstances,\nit savoured both of flirtation and of vulgarity that they should even\nfall out with each other--a consummation which appeared to be more or\nless definitely impending. Bernard remarked to himself that his own only\nreasonable line of conduct would be instantly to leave Baden, but I\nam almost ashamed to mention the fact which led him to modify this\ndecision. It was simply that he was induced to make the reflection that\nhe had really succeeded in putting Miss Vivian off her guard. How he had\ndone so he would have found it difficult to explain, inasmuch as in one\nway or another, for a week, he had spent several hours in talk with her.\nThe most effective way of putting her off her guard would have been to\nleave her alone, to forswear the privilege of conversation with her, to\npass the days in other society. This course would have had the drawback\nof not enabling him to measure the operation of so ingenious a policy,\nand Bernard liked, of all the things in the world, to know when he was\nsuccessful. He believed, at all events, that he was successful now, and\nthat the virtue of his conversation itself had persuaded this keen\nand brilliant girl that he was thinking of anything in the world but\nherself. He flattered himself that the civil indifference of his manner,\nthe abstract character of the topics he selected, the irrelevancy of\nhis allusions and the laxity of his attention, all contributed to this\nresult.\n\nSuch a result was certainly a remarkable one, for it is almost\nsuperfluous to intimate that Miss Vivian was, in fact, perpetually in\nhis thoughts. He made it a point of conscience not to think of her, but\nhe was thinking of her most when his conscience was most lively. Bernard\nhad a conscience--a conscience which, though a little irregular in\nits motions, gave itself in the long run a great deal of exercise; but\nnothing could have been more natural than that, curious, imaginative,\naudacious as he was, and delighting, as I have said, in the play of his\nsingularly nimble intelligence, he should have given himself up to a\nsort of unconscious experimentation. “I will leave her alone--I will be\nhanged if I attempt to draw her out!” he said to himself; and meanwhile\nhe was roaming afield and plucking personal impressions in great\nfragrant handfuls. All this, as I say, was natural, given the man and\nthe situation; the only oddity is that he should have fancied himself\nable to persuade the person most interested that he had renounced his\nadvantage.\n\nHe remembered her telling him that she cared very much what he should\nsay of her on Gordon Wright’s return, and he felt that this declaration\nhad a particular significance. After this, of her own movement, she\nnever spoke of Gordon, and Bernard made up his mind that she had\npromised her mother to accept him if he should repeat his proposal, and\nthat as her heart was not in the matter she preferred to drop a veil\nover the prospect. “She is going to marry him for his money,” he said,\n“because her mother has brought out the advantages of the thing. Mrs.\nVivian’s persuasive powers have carried the day, and the girl has made\nherself believe that it does n’t matter that she does n’t love him.\nPerhaps it does n’t--to her; it ‘s hard, in such a case, to put one’s\nself in the woman’s point of view. But I should think it would matter,\nsome day or other, to poor Gordon. She herself can’t help suspecting it\nmay make a difference in his happiness, and she therefore does n’t wish\nto seem any worse to him than is necessary. She wants me to speak well\nof her; if she intends to deceive him she expects me to back her up.\nThe wish is doubtless natural, but for a proud girl it is rather an odd\nfavor to ask. Oh yes, she ‘s a proud girl, even though she has been\nable to arrange it with her conscience to make a mercenary marriage. To\nexpect me to help her is perhaps to treat me as a friend; but she ought\nto remember--or at least I ought to remember--that Gordon is an older\nfriend than she. Inviting me to help her as against my oldest friend--is\nn’t there a grain of impudence in that?”\n\nIt will be gathered that Bernard’s meditations were not on the whole\nfavorable to this young lady, and it must be affirmed that he was\nforcibly struck with an element of cynicism in her conduct. On the\nevening of her so-called midnight visit to the Kursaal she had suddenly\nsounded a note of sweet submissiveness which re-appeared again at\nfrequent intervals. She was gentle, accessible, tenderly gracious,\nexpressive, demonstrative, almost flattering. From his own personal\npoint of view Bernard had no complaint to make of this maidenly\nurbanity, but he kept reminding himself that he was not in question and\nthat everything must be looked at in the light of Gordon’s requirements.\nThere was all this time an absurd logical twist in his view of things.\nIn the first place he was not to judge at all; and in the second he was\nto judge strictly on Gordon’s behalf. This latter clause always served\nas a justification when the former had failed to serve as a deterrent.\nWhen Bernard reproached himself for thinking too much of the girl, he\ndrew comfort from the reflection that he was not thinking well. To let\nit gradually filter into one’s mind, through a superficial complexity\nof more reverent preconceptions, that she was an extremely clever\ncoquette--this, surely, was not to think well! Bernard had luminous\nglimpses of another situation, in which Angela Vivian’s coquetry should\nmeet with a different appreciation; but just now it was not an item to\nbe entered on the credit side of Wright’s account. Bernard wiped his\npen, mentally speaking, as he made this reflection, and felt like a\ngrizzled old book-keeper, of incorruptible probity. He saw her, as\nI have said, very often; she continued to break her vow of shutting\nherself up, and at the end of a fortnight she had reduced it to\nimperceptible particles. On four different occasions, presenting himself\nat Mrs. Vivian’s lodgings, Bernard found Angela there alone. She made\nhim welcome, receiving him as an American girl, in such circumstances,\nis free to receive the most gallant of visitors. She smiled and talked\nand gave herself up to charming gayety, so that there was nothing\nfor Bernard to say but that now at least she was off her guard with\na vengeance. Happily he was on his own! He flattered himself that he\nremained so on occasions that were even more insidiously relaxing--when,\nin the evening, she strolled away with him to parts of the grounds of\nthe Conversation-house, where the music sank to sweeter softness and\nthe murmur of the tree-tops of the Black Forest, stirred by the warm\nnight-air, became almost audible; or when, in the long afternoons, they\nwandered in the woods apart from the others--from Mrs. Vivian and the\namiable object of her more avowed solicitude, the object of the sportive\nadoration of the irrepressible, the ever-present Lovelock. They were\nconstantly having parties in the woods at this time--driving over\nthe hills to points of interest which Bernard had looked out in\nthe guide-book. Bernard, in such matters, was extremely alert and\nconsiderate; he developed an unexpected talent for arranging excursions,\nand he had taken regularly into his service the red-waistcoated\nproprietor of a big Teutonic landau, which had a courier’s seat behind\nand was always at the service of the ladies. The functionary in the\nred waistcoat was a capital charioteer; he was constantly proposing\nnew drives, and he introduced our little party to treasures of romantic\nscenery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMore than a fortnight had elapsed, but Gordon Wright had not\nre-appeared, and Bernard suddenly decided that he would leave Baden. He\nfound Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, very opportunely, in the garden\nof the pleasant, homely Schloss which forms the residence of the Grand\nDukes of Baden during their visits to the scene of our narrative, and\nwhich, perched upon the hill-side directly above the little town, is\nsurrounded with charming old shrubberies and terraces. To this garden a\nportion of the public is admitted, and Bernard, who liked the place,\nhad been there more than once. One of the terraces had a high parapet,\nagainst which Angela was leaning, looking across the valley. Mrs. Vivian\nwas not at first in sight, but Bernard presently perceived her seated\nunder a tree with Victor Cousin in her hand. As Bernard approached the\nyoung girl, Angela, who had not seen him, turned round.\n\n“Don’t move,” he said. “You were just in the position in which I painted\nyour portrait at Siena.”\n\n“Don’t speak of that,” she answered.\n\n“I have never understood,” said Bernard, “why you insist upon ignoring\nthat charming incident.”\n\nShe resumed for a moment her former position, and stood looking at the\nopposite hills.\n\n“That ‘s just how you were--in profile--with your head a little thrown\nback.”\n\n“It was an odious incident!” Angela exclaimed, rapidly changing her\nattitude.\n\nBernard was on the point of making a rejoinder, but he thought of Gordon\nWright and held his tongue. He presently told her that he intended to\nleave Baden on the morrow.\n\nThey were walking toward her mother. She looked round at him quickly.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“To Paris,” he said, quite at hazard; for he had not in the least\ndetermined where to go.\n\n“To Paris--in the month of August?” And she gave a little laugh. “What a\nhappy inspiration!”\n\nShe gave a little laugh, but she said nothing more, and Bernard gave no\nfurther account of his plan. They went and sat down near Mrs. Vivian for\nten minutes, and then they got up again and strolled to another part of\nthe garden. They had it all to themselves, and it was filled with things\nthat Bernard liked--inequalities of level, with mossy steps connecting\nthem, rose-trees trained upon old brick walls, horizontal trellises\narranged like Italian pergolas, and here and there a towering poplar,\nlooking as if it had survived from some more primitive stage of culture,\nwith its stiff boughs motionless and its leaves forever trembling. They\nmade almost the whole circuit of the garden, and then Angela mentioned\nvery quietly that she had heard that morning from Mr. Wright, and that\nhe would not return for another week.\n\n“You had better stay,” she presently added, as if Gordon’s continued\nabsence were an added reason.\n\n“I don’t know,” said Bernard. “It is sometimes difficult to say what one\nhad better do.”\n\nI hesitate to bring against him that most inglorious of all charges,\nan accusation of sentimental fatuity, of the disposition to invent\nobstacles to enjoyment so that he might have the pleasure of seeing\na pretty girl attempt to remove them. But it must be admitted that if\nBernard really thought at present that he had better leave Baden, the\nobservation I have just quoted was not so much a sign of this conviction\nas of the hope that his companion would proceed to gainsay it. The\nhope was not disappointed, though I must add that no sooner had it been\ngratified than Bernard began to feel ashamed of it.\n\n“This certainly is not one of those cases,” said Angela. “The thing is\nsurely very simple now.”\n\n“What makes it so simple?”\n\nShe hesitated a moment.\n\n“The fact that I ask you to stay.”\n\n“You ask me?” he repeated, softly.\n\n“Ah,” she exclaimed, “one does n’t say those things twice!”\n\nShe turned away, and they went back to her mother, who gave Bernard a\nwonderful little look of half urgent, half remonstrant inquiry. As they\nleft the garden he walked beside Mrs. Vivian, Angela going in front of\nthem at a distance. The elder lady began immediately to talk to him of\nGordon Wright.\n\n“He ‘s not coming back for another week, you know,” she said. “I am\nsorry he stays away so long.”\n\n“Ah yes,” Bernard answered, “it seems very long indeed.”\n\nAnd it had, in fact, seemed to him very long.\n\n“I suppose he is always likely to have business,” said Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“You may be very sure it is not for his pleasure that he stays away.”\n\n“I know he is faithful to old friends,” said Mrs. Vivian. “I am sure he\nhas not forgotten us.”\n\n“I certainly count upon that,” Bernard exclaimed--“remembering him as we\ndo!”\n\nMrs. Vivian glanced at him gratefully.\n\n“Oh yes, we remember him--we remember him daily, hourly. At least, I\ncan speak for my daughter and myself. He has been so very kind to us.”\n Bernard said nothing, and she went on. “And you have been so very kind\nto us, too, Mr. Longueville. I want so much to thank you.”\n\n“Oh no, don’t!” said Bernard, frowning. “I would rather you should n’t.”\n\n“Of course,” Mrs. Vivian added, “I know it ‘s all on his account;\nbut that makes me wish to thank you all the more. Let me express my\ngratitude, in advance, for the rest of the time, till he comes back.\nThat ‘s more responsibility than you bargained for,” she said, with a\nlittle nervous laugh.\n\n“Yes, it ‘s more than I bargained for. I am thinking of going away.”\n\nMrs. Vivian almost gave a little jump, and then she paused on the Baden\ncobble-stones, looking up at him.\n\n“If you must go, Mr. Longueville--don’t sacrifice yourself!”\n\nThe exclamation fell upon Bernard’s ear with a certain softly mocking\ncadence which was sufficient, however, to make this organ tingle.\n\n“Oh, after all, you know,” he said, as they walked on--“after all, you\nknow, I am not like Wright--I have no business.”\n\nHe walked with the ladies to the door of their lodging. Angela kept\nalways in front. She stood there, however, at the little confectioner’s\nwindow until the others came up. She let her mother pass in, and then\nshe said to Bernard, looking at him--\n\n“Shall I see you again?”\n\n“Some time, I hope.”\n\n“I mean--are you going away?”\n\nBernard looked for a moment at a little pink sugar cherub--a species\nof Cupid, with a gilded bow--which figured among the pastry-cook’s\nenticements. Then he said--\n\n“I will come and tell you this evening.”\n\nAnd in the evening he went to tell her; she had mentioned during the\nwalk in the garden of the Schloss that they should not go out. As he\napproached Mrs. Vivian’s door he saw a figure in a light dress standing\nin the little balcony. He stopped and looked up, and then the person in\nthe light dress, leaning her hands on the railing, with her shoulders a\nlittle raised, bent over and looked down at him. It was very dark,\nbut even through the thick dusk he thought he perceived the finest\nbrilliancy of Angela Vivian’s smile.\n\n“I shall not go away,” he said, lifting his voice a little.\n\nShe made no answer; she only stood looking down at him through the warm\ndusk and smiling. He went into the house, and he remained at Baden-Baden\ntill Gordon came back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nGordon asked him no questions for twenty-four hours after his return,\nthen suddenly he began:\n\n“Well, have n’t you something to say to me?”\n\nIt was at the hotel, in Gordon’s apartment, late in the afternoon.\nA heavy thunder-storm had broken over the place an hour before, and\nBernard had been standing at one of his friend’s windows, rather idly,\nwith his hands in his pockets, watching the rain-torrents dance upon\nthe empty pavements. At last the deluge abated, the clouds began to\nbreak--there was a promise of a fine evening. Gordon Wright, while the\nstorm was at its climax, sat down to write letters, and wrote half a\ndozen. It was after he had sealed, directed and affixed a postage-stamp\nto the last of the series that he addressed to his companion the\nquestion I have just quoted.\n\n“Do you mean about Miss Vivian?” Bernard asked, without turning round\nfrom the window.\n\n“About Miss Vivian, of course.” Bernard said nothing and his companion\nwent on. “Have you nothing to tell me about Miss Vivian?”\n\nBernard presently turned round looking at Gordon and smiling a little.\n\n“She ‘s a delightful creature!”\n\n“That won’t do--you have tried that before,” said Gordon. “No,” he added\nin a moment, “that won’t do.” Bernard turned back to the window, and\nGordon continued, as he remained silent. “I shall have a right to\nconsider your saying nothing a proof of an unfavorable judgment. You\ndon’t like her!”\n\nBernard faced quickly about again, and for an instant the two men looked\nat each other.\n\n“Ah, my dear Gordon,” Longueville murmured.\n\n“Do you like her then?” asked Wright, getting up.\n\n“No!” said Longueville.\n\n“That ‘s just what I wanted to know, and I am much obliged to you for\ntelling me.”\n\n“I am not obliged to you for asking me. I was in hopes you would n’t.”\n\n“You dislike her very much then?” Gordon exclaimed, gravely.\n\n“Won’t disliking her, simply, do?” said Bernard.\n\n“It will do very well. But it will do a little better if you will tell\nme why. Give me a reason or two.”\n\n“Well,” said Bernard, “I tried to make love to her and she boxed my\nears.”\n\n“The devil!” cried Gordon.\n\n“I mean morally, you know.”\n\nGordon stared; he seemed a little puzzled.\n\n“You tried to make love to her morally?”\n\n“She boxed my ears morally,” said Bernard, laughing out.\n\n“Why did you try to make love to her?”\n\nThis inquiry was made in a tone so expressive of an unbiassed\ntruth-seeking habit that Bernard’s mirth was not immediately quenched.\nNevertheless, he replied with sufficient gravity--\n\n“To test her fidelity to you. Could you have expected anything else? You\ntold me you were afraid she was a latent coquette. You gave me a chance,\nand I tried to ascertain.”\n\n“And you found she was not. Is that what you mean?”\n\n“She ‘s as firm as a rock. My dear Gordon, Miss Vivian is as firm as the\nfirmest of your geological formations.”\n\nGordon shook his head with a strange positive persistence.\n\n“You are talking nonsense. You are not serious. You are not telling me\nthe truth. I don’t believe that you attempted to make love to her.\nYou would n’t have played such a game as that. It would n’t have been\nhonorable.”\n\nBernard flushed a little; he was irritated.\n\n“Oh come, don’t make too much of a point of that! Did n’t you tell me\nbefore that it was a great opportunity?”\n\n“An opportunity to be wise--not to be foolish!”\n\n“Ah, there is only one sort of opportunity,” cried Bernard. “You\nexaggerate the reach of human wisdom.”\n\n“Suppose she had let you make love to her,” said Gordon. “That would\nhave been a beautiful result of your experiment.”\n\n“I should have seemed to you a rascal, perhaps, but I should have saved\nyou from a latent coquette. You would owe some thanks for that.”\n\n“And now you have n’t saved me,” said Gordon, with a simple air of\nnoting a fact.\n\n“You assume--in spite of what I say--that she is a coquette!”\n\n“I assume something because you evidently conceal something. I want the\nwhole truth.”\n\nBernard turned back to the window with increasing irritation.\n\n“If he wants the whole truth he shall have it,” he said to himself.\n\nHe stood a moment in thought and then he looked at his companion again.\n\n“I think she would marry you--but I don’t think she cares for you.”\n\nGordon turned a little pale, but he clapped his hands together.\n\n“Very good,” he exclaimed. “That ‘s exactly how I want you to speak.”\n\n“Her mother has taken a great fancy to your fortune and it has rubbed\noff on the girl, who has made up her mind that it would be a pleasant\nthing to have thirty thousand a year, and that her not caring for you is\nan unimportant detail.”\n\n“I see--I see,” said Gordon, looking at his friend with an air of\nadmiration for his frank and lucid way of putting things.\n\nNow that he had begun to be frank and lucid, Bernard found a charm in\nit, and the impulse under which he had spoken urged him almost violently\nforward.\n\n“The mother and daughter have agreed together to bag you, and Angela, I\nam sure, has made a vow to be as nice to you after marriage as possible.\nMrs. Vivian has insisted upon the importance of that; Mrs. Vivian is a\ngreat moralist.”\n\nGordon kept gazing at his friend; he seemed positively fascinated.\n\n“Yes, I have noticed that in Mrs. Vivian,” he said.\n\n“Ah, she ‘s a very nice woman!”\n\n“It ‘s not true, then,” said Gordon, “that you tried to make love to\nAngela?”\n\nBernard hesitated a single instant.\n\n\n\n“No, it is n’t true. I calumniated myself, to save her reputation. You\ninsisted on my giving you a reason for my not liking her--I gave you\nthat one.”\n\n“And your real reason--”\n\n“My real reason is that I believe she would do you what I can’t help\nregarding as an injury.”\n\n“Of course!” and Gordon, dropping his interested eyes, stared for some\nmoments at the carpet. “But it is n’t true, then, that you discovered\nher to be a coquette?”\n\n“Ah, that ‘s another matter.”\n\n“You did discover it all the same?”\n\n“Since you want the whole truth--I did!”\n\n“How did you discover it?” Gordon asked, clinging to his right of\ninterrogation.\n\nBernard hesitated.\n\n“You must remember that I saw a great deal of her.”\n\n“You mean that she encouraged you?”\n\n“If I had not been a very faithful friend I might have thought so.”\n\nGordon laid his hand appreciatively, gratefully, on Bernard’s shoulder.\n\n“And even that did n’t make you like her?”\n\n“Confound it, you make me blush!” cried Bernard, blushing a little in\nfact. “I have said quite enough; excuse me from drawing the portrait of\ntoo insensible a man. It was my point of view; I kept thinking of you.”\n\nGordon, with his hand still on his friend’s arm, patted it an instant in\nresponse to this declaration; then he turned away.\n\n“I am much obliged to you. That ‘s my notion of friendship. You have\nspoken out like a man.”\n\n“Like a man, yes. Remember that. Not in the least like an oracle.”\n\n“I prefer an honest man to all the oracles,” said Gordon.\n\n“An honest man has his impressions! I have given you mine--they pretend\nto be nothing more. I hope they have n’t offended you.”\n\n“Not in the least.”\n\n“Nor distressed, nor depressed, nor in any way discomposed you?”\n\n\n\n“For what do you take me? I asked you a favor--a service; I imposed it\non you. You have done the thing, and my part is simple gratitude.”\n\n“Thank you for nothing,” said Bernard, smiling. “You have asked me a\ngreat many questions; there is one that in turn I have a right to ask\nyou. What do you propose to do in consequence of what I have told you?”\n\n“I propose to do nothing.”\n\nThis declaration closed the colloquy, and the young men separated.\nBernard saw Gordon no more that evening; he took for granted he had gone\nto Mrs. Vivian’s. The burden of Longueville’s confidences was a heavy\nload to carry there, but Bernard ventured to hope that he would deposit\nit at the door. He had given Gordon his impressions, and the latter\nmight do with them what he chose--toss them out of the window, or let\nthem grow stale with heedless keeping. So Bernard meditated, as he\nwandered about alone for the rest of the evening. It was useless to\nlook for Mrs. Vivian’s little circle, on the terrace of the\nConversation-house, for the storm in the afternoon had made the place so\ndamp that it was almost forsaken of its frequenters. Bernard spent the\nevening in the gaming-rooms, in the thick of the crowd that pressed\nabout the tables, and by way of a change--he had hitherto been almost\nnothing of a gambler--he laid down a couple of pieces at roulette. He\nhad played but two or three times, without winning a penny; but now he\nhad the agreeable sensation of drawing in a small handful of gold.\nHe continued to play, and he continued to win. His luck surprised and\nexcited him--so much so that after it had repeated itself half a dozen\ntimes he left the place and walked about for half an hour in the outer\ndarkness. He felt amused and exhilarated, but the feeling amounted\nalmost to agitation. He, nevertheless, returned to the tables, where he\nagain found success awaiting him. Again and again he put his money on\na happy number, and so steady a run of luck began at last to attract\nattention. The rumor of it spread through the rooms, and the crowd about\nthe roulette received a large contingent of spectators. Bernard felt\nthat they were looking more or less eagerly for a turn of the tide; but\nhe was in the humor for disappointing them, and he left the place, while\nhis luck was still running high, with ten thousand francs in his pocket.\nIt was very late when he returned to the inn--so late that he forbore\nto knock at Gordon’s door. But though he betook himself to his own\nquarters, he was far from finding, or even seeking, immediate rest. He\nknocked about, as he would have said, for half the night--not because he\nwas delighted at having won ten thousand francs, but rather because all\nof a sudden he found himself disgusted at the manner in which he\nhad spent the evening. It was extremely characteristic of Bernard\nLongueville that his pleasure should suddenly transform itself into\nflatness. What he felt was not regret or repentance. He had it not\nin the least on his conscience that he had given countenance to the\nreprehensible practice of gaming. It was annoyance that he had passed\nout of his own control--that he had obeyed a force which he was unable\nto measure at the time. He had been drunk and he was turning sober. In\nspite of a great momentary appearance of frankness and a lively relish\nof any conjunction of agreeable circumstances exerting a pressure to\nwhich one could respond, Bernard had really little taste for giving\nhimself up, and he never did so without very soon wishing to take\nhimself back. He had now given himself to something that was not\nhimself, and the fact that he had gained ten thousand francs by it was\nan insufficient salve to an aching sense of having ceased to be his own\nmaster. He had not been playing--he had been played with. He had been\nthe sport of a blind, brutal chance, and he felt humiliated by having\nbeen favored by so rudely-operating a divinity. Good luck and bad luck?\nBernard felt very scornful of the distinction, save that good luck\nseemed to him rather the more vulgar. As the night went on his disgust\ndeepened, and at last the weariness it brought with it sent him to\nsleep. He slept very late, and woke up to a disagreeable consciousness.\nAt first, before collecting his thoughts, he could not imagine what\nhe had on his mind--was it that he had spoken ill of Angela Vivian? It\nbrought him extraordinary relief to remember that he had gone to bed in\nextreme ill-humor with his exploits at roulette. After he had dressed\nhimself and just as he was leaving his room, a servant brought him a\nnote superscribed in Gordon’s hand--a note of which the following proved\nto be the contents.\n\n“Seven o’clock, A.M.\n\n“My dear Bernard: Circumstances have determined me to leave Baden\nimmediately, and I shall take the train that starts an hour hence. I am\ntold that you came in very late last night, so I won’t disturb you for\na painful parting at this unnatural hour. I came to this decision last\nevening, and I put up my things; so I have nothing to do but to take\nmyself off. I shall go to Basel, but after that I don’t know where, and\nin so comfortless an uncertainty I don’t ask you to follow me. Perhaps\nI shall go to America; but in any case I shall see you sooner or later.\nMeanwhile, my dear Bernard, be as happy as your brilliant talents should\nproperly make you, and believe me yours ever,\n\n“G.W.\n\n“P.S. It is perhaps as well that I should say that I am leaving in\nconsequence of something that happened last evening, but not--by any\ntraceable process--in consequence of the talk we had together. I may\nalso add that I am in very good health and spirits.”\n\nBernard lost no time in learning that his friend had in fact departed\nby the eight o’clock train--the morning was now well advanced; and then,\nover his breakfast, he gave himself up to meditative surprise. What had\nhappened during the evening--what had happened after their conversation\nin Gordon’s room? He had gone to Mrs. Vivian’s--what had happened there?\nBernard found it difficult to believe that he had gone there simply to\nnotify her that, having talked it over with an intimate friend, he gave\nup her daughter, or to mention to the young lady herself that he had\nceased to desire the honor of her hand. Gordon alluded to some definite\noccurrence, yet it was inconceivable that he should have allowed himself\nto be determined by Bernard’s words--his diffident and irresponsible\nimpression. Bernard resented this idea as an injury to himself, yet\nit was difficult to imagine what else could have happened. There was\nGordon’s word for it, however, that there was no “traceable” connection\nbetween the circumstances which led to his sudden departure and the\ninformation he had succeeded in extracting from his friend. What did he\nmean by a “traceable” connection? Gordon never used words idly, and he\nmeant to make of this point an intelligible distinction. It was this\nsense of his usual accuracy of expression that assisted Bernard in\nfitting a meaning to his late companion’s letter. He intended to\nintimate that he had come back to Baden with his mind made up to\nrelinquish his suit, and that he had questioned Bernard simply from\nmoral curiosity--for the sake of intellectual satisfaction. Nothing was\naltered by the fact that Bernard had told him a sorry tale; it had not\nmodified his behavior--that effect would have been traceable. It\nhad simply affected his imagination, which was a consequence of the\nimponderable sort. This view of the case was supported by Gordon’s\nmention of his good spirits. A man always had good spirits when he had\nacted in harmony with a conviction. Of course, after renouncing the\nattempt to make himself acceptable to Miss Vivian, the only possible\nthing for Gordon had been to leave Baden. Bernard, continuing to\nmeditate, at last convinced himself that there had been no explicit\nrupture, that Gordon’s last visit had simply been a visit of farewell,\nthat its character had sufficiently signified his withdrawal, and that\nhe had now gone away because, after giving the girl up, he wished\nvery naturally not to meet her again. This was, on Bernard’s part,\na sufficiently coherent view of the case; but nevertheless, an hour\nafterward, as he strolled along the Lichtenthal Alley, he found himself\nstopping suddenly and exclaiming under his breath--“Have I done her\nan injury? Have I affected her prospects?” Later in the day he said to\nhimself half a dozen times that he had simply warned Gordon against an\nincongruous union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nNow that Gordon was gone, at any rate, gone for good, and not to return,\nhe felt a sudden and singular sense of freedom. It was a feeling of\nunbounded expansion, quite out of proportion, as he said to himself, to\nany assignable cause. Everything suddenly appeared to have become very\noptional; but he was quite at a loss what to do with his liberty. It\nseemed a harmless use to make of it, in the afternoon, to go and pay\nanother visit to the ladies who lived at the confectioner’s. Here,\nhowever, he met a reception which introduced a fresh element of\nperplexity into the situation that Gordon had left behind him. The door\nwas opened to him by Mrs. Vivian’s maid-servant, a sturdy daughter\nof the Schwartzwald, who informed him that the ladies--with much\nregret--were unable to receive any one.\n\n“They are very busy--and they are ill,” said the young woman, by way of\nexplanation.\n\nBernard was disappointed, and he felt like arguing the case.\n\n“Surely,” he said, “they are not both ill and busy! When you make\nexcuses, you should make them agree with each other.”\n\nThe Teutonic soubrette fixed her round blue eyes a minute upon the patch\nof blue sky revealed to her by her open door.\n\n“I say what I can, lieber Herr. It ‘s not my fault if I ‘m not so clever\nas a French mamsell. One of the ladies is busy, the other is ill. There\nyou have it.”\n\n“Not quite,” said Bernard. “You must remember that there are three of\nthem.”\n\n“Oh, the little one--the little one weeps.”\n\n“Miss Evers weeps!” exclaimed Bernard, to whom the vision of this young\nlady in tears had never presented itself.\n\n“That happens to young ladies when they are unhappy,” said the girl; and\nwith an artless yet significant smile she carried a big red hand to the\nleft side of a broad bosom.\n\n“I am sorry she is unhappy; but which of the other ladies is ill?”\n\n“The mother is very busy.”\n\n“And the daughter is ill?”\n\nThe young woman looked at him an instant, smiling again, and the light\nin her little blue eyes indicated confusion, but not perversity.\n\n“No, the mamma is ill,” she exclaimed, “and the daughter is very busy.\nThey are preparing to leave Baden.”\n\n“To leave Baden? When do they go?”\n\n“I don’t quite know, lieber Herr; but very soon.”\n\nWith this information Bernard turned away. He was rather surprised, but\nhe reflected that Mrs. Vivian had not proposed to spend her life on the\nbanks of the Oos, and that people were leaving Baden every day in the\nyear. In the evening, at the Kursaal, he met Captain Lovelock, who was\nwandering about with an air of explosive sadness.\n\n“Damn it, they ‘re going--yes, they ‘re going,” said the Captain, after\nthe two young men had exchanged a few allusions to current events.\n“Fancy their leaving us in that heartless manner! It ‘s not the time to\nrun away--it ‘s the time to keep your rooms, if you ‘re so lucky as to\nhave any. The races begin next week and there ‘ll be a tremendous crowd.\nAll the grand-ducal people are coming. Miss Evers wanted awfully to see\nthe Grand Duke, and I promised her an introduction. I can’t make out\nwhat Mrs. Vivian is up to. I bet you a ten-pound note she ‘s giving\nchase. Our friend Wright has come back and gone off again, and Mrs.\nVivian means to strike camp and follow. She ‘ll pot him yet; you see if\nshe does n’t!”\n\n“She is running away from you, dangerous man!” said Bernard.\n\n“Do you mean on account of Miss Evers? Well, I admire Miss Evers--I\ndon’t mind admitting that; but I ain’t dangerous,” said Captain\nLovelock, with a lustreless eye. “How can a fellow be dangerous when he\nhas n’t ten shillings in his pocket? Desperation, do you call it? But\nMiss Evers has n’t money, so far as I have heard. I don’t ask you,”\n Lovelock continued--“I don’t care a damn whether she has or not. She ‘s\na devilish charming girl, and I don’t mind telling you I ‘m hit. I stand\nno chance--I know I stand no chance. Mrs. Vivian ‘s down on me, and, by\nJove, Mrs. Vivian ‘s right. I ‘m not the husband to pick out for a young\nwoman of expensive habits and no expectations. Gordon Wright’s the sort\nof young man that ‘s wanted, and, hang me, if Mrs. Vivian did n’t want\nhim so much for her own daughter, I believe she ‘d try and bag him for\nthe little one. Gad, I believe that to keep me off she would like to\ncut him in two and give half to each of them! I ‘m afraid of that little\nwoman. She has got a little voice like a screw-driver. But for all that,\nif I could get away from this cursed place, I would keep the girl in\nsight--hang me if I would n’t! I ‘d cut the races--dash me if I would\nn’t! But I ‘m in pawn, if you know what that means. I owe a beastly lot\nof money at the inn, and that impudent little beggar of a landlord won’t\nlet me out of his sight. The luck ‘s dead against me at those filthy\ntables; I have n’t won a farthing in three weeks. I wrote to my brother\nthe other day, and this morning I got an answer from him--a cursed,\ncanting letter of good advice, remarking that he had already paid my\ndebts seven times. It does n’t happen to be seven; it ‘s only six, or\nsix and a half! Does he expect me to spend the rest of my life at the\nHotel de Hollande? Perhaps he would like me to engage as a waiter there\nand pay it off by serving at the table d’hote. It would be convenient\nfor him the next time he comes abroad with his seven daughters and two\ngovernesses. I hate the smell of their beastly table d’hote! You ‘re\nsorry I ‘m hard up? I ‘m sure I ‘m much obliged to you. Can you be of\nany service? My dear fellow, if you are bent on throwing your money\nabout the place I ‘m not the man to stop you.” Bernard’s winnings of the\nprevious night were burning a hole, as the phrase is, in his pocket. Ten\nthousand francs had never before seemed to him so heavy a load to carry,\nand to lighten the weight of his good luck by lending fifty pounds to\na less fortunate fellow-player was an operation that not only gratified\nhis good-nature but strongly commended itself to his conscience.\nHis conscience, however, made its conditions. “My dear Longueville,”\n Lovelock went on, “I have always gone in for family feeling, early\nassociations, and all that sort of thing. That ‘s what made me confide\nmy difficulties to Dovedale. But, upon my honor, you remind me of the\ngood Samaritan, or that sort of person; you are fonder of me than my own\nbrother! I ‘ll take fifty pounds with pleasure, thank you, and you\nshall have them again--at the earliest opportunity. My earliest\nconvenience--will that do? Damn it, it is a convenience, is n’t it? You\nmake your conditions. My dear fellow, I accept them in advance. That\nI ‘m not to follow up Miss Evers--is that what you mean? Have you been\ncommissioned by the family to buy me off? It ‘s devilish cruel to take\nadvantage of my poverty! Though I ‘m poor, I ‘m honest. But I am honest,\nmy dear Longueville; that ‘s the point. I ‘ll give you my word, and I\n‘ll keep it. I won’t go near that girl again--I won’t think of her till\nI ‘ve got rid of your fifty pounds. It ‘s a dreadful encouragement to\nextravagance, but that ‘s your lookout. I ‘ll stop for their beastly\nraces and the young lady shall be sacred.”\n\nLongueville called the next morning at Mrs. Vivian’s, and learned that\nthe three ladies had left Baden by the early train, a couple of hours\nbefore. This fact produced in his mind a variety of emotions--surprise,\nannoyance, embarrassment. In spite of his effort to think it natural\nthey should go, he found something precipitate and inexplicable in the\nmanner of their going, and he declared to himself that one of the party,\nat least, had been unkind and ungracious in not giving him a chance\nto say good-bye. He took refuge by anticipation, as it were, in this\nreflection, whenever, for the next three or four days, he foresaw\nhimself stopping short, as he had done before, and asking himself\nwhether he had done an injury to Angela Vivian. This was an idle and\nunpractical question, inasmuch as the answer was not forthcoming;\nwhereas it was quite simple and conclusive to say, without the note\nof interrogation, that she was, in spite of many attractive points,\nan abrupt and capricious young woman. During the three or four days in\nquestion, Bernard lingered on at Baden, uncertain what to do or where\nto go, feeling as if he had received a sudden check--a sort of spiritual\nsnub--which arrested the accumulation of motive. Lovelock, also, whom\nBernard saw every day, appeared to think that destiny had given him\na slap in the face, for he had not enjoyed the satisfaction of a last\ninterview with Miss Evers.\n\n“I thought she might have written me a note,” said the Captain; “but it\nappears she does n’t write. Some girls don’t write, you know.”\n\nBernard remarked that it was possible Lovelock would still have news of\nMiss Blanche; and before he left Baden he learned that she had addressed\nher forsaken swain a charming little note from Lausanne, where the three\nladies had paused in their flight from Baden, and where Mrs. Vivian had\ndecreed that for the present they should remain.\n\n“I ‘m devilish glad she writes,” said Captain Lovelock; “some girls do\nwrite, you know.”\n\nBlanche found Lausanne most horrid after Baden, for whose delights she\nlanguished. The delights of Baden, however, were not obvious just now to\nher correspondent, who had taken Bernard’s fifty pounds into the Kursaal\nand left them there. Bernard, on learning his misfortune, lent him\nanother fifty, with which he performed a second series of unsuccessful\nexperiments; and our hero was not at his ease until he had passed over\nto his luckless friend the whole amount of his own winnings, every penny\nof which found its way through Captain Lovelock’s fingers back into the\nbank. When this operation was completed, Bernard left Baden, the Captain\ngloomily accompanying him to the station.\n\nI have said that there had come over Bernard a singular sense of\nfreedom. One of the uses he made of his freedom was to undertake a long\njourney. He went to the East and remained absent from Europe for upward\nof two years--a period of his life of which it is not proposed to\noffer a complete history. The East is a wonderful region, and Bernard,\ninvestigating the mysteries of Asia, saw a great many curious and\nbeautiful things. He had moments of keen enjoyment; he laid up a great\nstore of impressions and even a considerable sum of knowledge. But,\nnevertheless, he was not destined to look back upon this episode with\nany particular complacency. It was less delightful than it was supposed\nto be; it was less successful than it might have been. By what unnatural\nelement the cup of pleasure was adulterated, he would have been very\nmuch at a loss to say; but it was an incontestable fact that at times he\nsipped it as a medicine, rather than quaffed it as a nectar. When people\ncongratulated him on his opportunity of seeing the world, and said they\nenvied him the privilege of seeing it so well, he felt even more than\nthe usual degree of irritation produced by an insinuation that fortune\nthinks so poorly of us as to give us easy terms. Misplaced sympathy is\nthe least available of superfluities, and Bernard at this time found\nhimself thinking that there was a good deal of impertinence in the\nworld. He would, however, readily have confessed that, in so far as he\nfailed to enjoy his Oriental wanderings, the fault was his own; though\nhe would have made mentally the gratifying reflection that never was\na fault less deliberate. If, during the period of which I speak, his\nnatural gayety had sunk to a minor key, a partial explanation may\nbe found in the fact that he was deprived of the society of his late\ncompanion. It was an odd circumstance that the two young men had not met\nsince Gordon’s abrupt departure from Baden. Gordon went to Berlin, and\nshortly afterward to America, so that they were on opposite sides of the\nglobe. Before he returned to his own country, Bernard made by letter two\nor three offers to join him in Europe, anywhere that was agreeable to\nhim. Gordon answered that his movements were very uncertain, and that he\nshould be sorry to trouble Bernard to follow him about. He had put him\nto this inconvenience in making him travel from Venice to Baden, and\none such favor at a time was enough to ask, even of the most obliging of\nmen. Bernard was, of course, afraid that what he had told Gordon about\nAngela Vivian was really the cause of a state of things which, as\nbetween two such good friends, wore a perceptible resemblance to\nalienation. Gordon had given her up; but he bore Bernard a grudge for\nspeaking ill of her, and so long as this disagreeable impression should\nlast, he preferred not to see him. Bernard was frank enough to charge\nthe poor fellow with a lingering rancor, of which he made, indeed, no\ngreat crime. But Gordon denied the allegation, and assured him that,\nto his own perception, there was no decline in their intimacy. He only\nrequested, as a favor and as a tribute to “just susceptibilities,”\n that Bernard would allude no more either to Miss Vivian or to what had\nhappened at Baden. This request was easy to comply with, and Bernard, in\nwriting, strictly conformed to it; but it seemed to him that the act of\ndoing so was in itself a cooling-off. What would be a better proof of\nwhat is called a “tension” than an agreement to avoid a natural topic?\nBernard moralized a little over Gordon’s “just susceptibilities,” and\nfelt that the existence of a perverse resentment in so honest a nature\nwas a fact gained to his acquaintance with psychological science. It\ncannot be said, however, that he suffered this fact to occupy at all\ntimes the foreground of his consciousness. Bernard was like some great\npainters; his foregrounds were very happily arranged. He heard nothing\nof Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, beyond a rumor that they had gone to\nItaly; and he learned, on apparently good authority, that Blanche Evers\nhad returned to New York with her mother. He wondered whether Captain\nLovelock was still in pawn at the Hotel de Hollande. If he did not allow\nhimself to wonder too curiously whether he had done a harm to Gordon,\nit may be affirmed that he was haunted by the recurrence of that other\nquestion, of which mention has already been made. Had he done a harm to\nAngela Vivian, and did she know that he had done it? This inquiry by no\nmeans made him miserable, and it was far from awaiting him regularly\non his pillow. But it visited him at intervals, and sometimes in the\nstrangest places--suddenly, abruptly, in the stillness of an Indian\ntemple, or amid the shrillness of an Oriental crowd. He became familiar\nwith it at last; he called it his Jack-in-the-box. Some invisible touch\nof circumstance would press the spring, and the little image would\npop up, staring him in the face and grinning an interrogation. Bernard\nalways clapped down the lid, for he regarded this phenomenon as\nstrikingly inane. But if it was more frequent than any pang of\nconscience connected with the remembrance of Gordon himself, this last\nsentiment was certainly lively enough to make it a great relief to hear\nat last a rumor that the excellent fellow was about to be married. The\nrumor reached him at Athens; it was vague and indirect, and it omitted\nthe name of his betrothed. But Bernard made the most of it, and took\ncomfort in the thought that his friend had recovered his spirits and his\nappetite for matrimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIt was not till our hero reached Paris, on his return from the distant\nEast, that the rumor I have just mentioned acquired an appreciable\nconsistency. Here, indeed, it took the shape of authentic information.\nAmong a number of delayed letters which had been awaiting him at\nhis banker’s he found a communication from Gordon Wright. During\nthe previous year or two his correspondence with this trusted--and\ntrusting--friend had not been frequent, and Bernard had received little\ndirect news of him. Three or four short letters had overtaken him in his\nwanderings--letters as cordial, to all appearance, if not as voluminous,\nas the punctual missives of an earlier time. Bernard made a point of\nsatisfying himself that they were as cordial; he weighed them in the\nscales of impartial suspicion. It seemed to him on the whole that there\nwas no relaxation of Gordon’s epistolary tone. If he wrote less often\nthan he used to do, that was a thing that very commonly happened as men\ngrew older. The closest intimacies, moreover, had phases and seasons,\nintermissions and revivals, and even if his friend had, in fact, averted\nhis countenance from him, this was simply the accomplishment of a\nperiodical revolution which would bring them in due order face to face\nagain. Bernard made a point, himself, of writing tolerably often\nand writing always in the friendliest tone. He made it a matter of\nconscience--he liked to feel that he was treating Gordon generously,\nand not demanding an eye for an eye. The letter he found in Paris was so\nshort that I may give it entire.\n\n“My dear Bernard (it ran), I must write to you before I write to any\none else, though unfortunately you are so far away that you can’t be the\nfirst to congratulate me. Try and not be the last, however. I am going\nto be married--as soon as possible. You know the young lady, so you can\nappreciate the situation. Do you remember little Blanche Evers, whom we\nused to see three years ago at Baden-Baden? Of course you remember\nher, for I know you used often to talk with her. You will be rather\nsurprised, perhaps, at my having selected her as the partner of a\nlife-time; but we manage these matters according to our lights. I am\nvery much in love with her, and I hold that an excellent reason. I have\nbeen ready any time this year or two to fall in love with some simple,\ntrusting, child-like nature. I find this in perfection in this charming\nyoung girl. I find her so natural and fresh. I remember telling you\nonce that I did n’t wish to be fascinated--that I wanted to estimate\nscientifically the woman I should marry. I have altogether got over\nthat, and I don’t know how I ever came to talk such nonsense. I am\nfascinated now, and I assure you I like it! The best of it is that I\nfind it does n’t in the least prevent my estimating Blanche. I judge her\nvery fairly--I see just what she is. She ‘s simple--that ‘s what I want;\nshe ‘s tender--that ‘s what I long for. You will remember how pretty she\nis; I need n’t remind you of that. She was much younger then, and she\nhas greatly developed and improved in these two or three years. But she\nwill always be young and innocent--I don’t want her to improve too much.\nShe came back to America with her mother the winter after we met her at\nBaden, but I never saw her again till three months ago. Then I saw her\nwith new eyes, and I wondered I could have been so blind. But I was n’t\nready for her till then, and what makes me so happy now is to know that\nI have come to my present way of feeling by experience. That gives me\nconfidence--you see I am a reasoner still. But I am under the charm, for\nall my reason. We are to be married in a month--try and come back to the\nwedding. Blanche sends you a message, which I will give you verbatim.\n‘Tell him I am not such a silly little chatterbox as I used to be at\nBaden. I am a great deal wiser; I am almost as clever as Angela Vivian.’\nShe has an idea you thought Miss Vivian very clever--but it is not true\nthat she is equally so. I am very happy; come home and see.”\n\nBernard went home, but he was not able to reach the United States in\ntime for Gordon’s wedding, which took place at midsummer. Bernard,\narriving late in the autumn, found his friend a married man of some\nmonths’ standing, and was able to judge, according to his invitation,\nwhether he appeared happy. The first effect of the letter I have just\nquoted had been an immense surprise; the second had been a series\nof reflections which were quite the negative of surprise; and these\noperations of Bernard’s mind had finally merged themselves in a simple\nsentiment of jollity. He was delighted that Gordon should be married; he\nfelt jovial about it; he was almost indifferent to the question of whom\nhe had chosen. Certainly, at first, the choice of Blanche Evers seemed\nhighly incongruous; it was difficult to imagine a young woman less\nshaped to minister to Gordon’s strenuous needs than the light-hearted\nand empty-headed little flirt whose inconsequent prattle had remained\nfor Bernard one of the least importunate memories of a charming time.\nBlanche Evers was a pretty little goose--the prettiest of little geese,\nperhaps, and doubtless the most amiable; but she was not a companion for\na peculiarly serious man, who would like his wife to share his view\nof human responsibilities. What a singular selection--what a queer\ninfatuation! Bernard had no sooner committed himself to this line of\ncriticism than he stopped short, with the sudden consciousness of error\ncarried almost to the point of naivetae. He exclaimed that Blanche Evers\nwas exactly the sort of girl that men of Gordon Wright’s stamp always\nended by falling in love with, and that poor Gordon knew very much\nbetter what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to\nsolve the deep problem of a comfortable life with Angela Vivian. This\nwas what your strong, solid, sensible fellows always came to; they paid,\nin this particular, a larger tribute to pure fancy than the people who\nwere supposed habitually to cultivate that muse. Blanche Evers was what\nthe French call an article of fantasy, and Gordon had taken a pleasure\nin finding her deliciously useless. He cultivated utility in other ways,\nand it pleased and flattered him to feel that he could afford, morally\nspeaking, to have a kittenish wife. He had within himself a fund of\ncommon sense to draw upon, so that to espouse a paragon of wisdom would\nbe but to carry water to the fountain. He could easily make up for the\ndeficiencies of a wife who was a little silly, and if she charmed and\namused him, he could treat himself to the luxury of these sensations for\nthemselves. He was not in the least afraid of being ruined by it, and if\nBlanche’s birdlike chatter and turns of the head had made a fool of him,\nhe knew it perfectly well, and simply took his stand upon his rights.\nEvery man has a right to a little flower-bed, and life is not all mere\nkitchen-gardening. Bernard rapidly extemporized this rough explanation\nof the surprise his friend had offered him, and he found it\nall-sufficient for his immediate needs. He wrote Blanche a charming\nnote, to which she replied with a great deal of spirit and grace. Her\nlittle letter was very prettily turned, and Bernard, reading it over two\nor three times, said to himself that, to do her justice, she might very\nwell have polished her intellect a trifle during these two or three\nyears. As she was older, she could hardly help being wiser. It even\noccurred to Bernard that she might have profited by the sort of\nexperience that is known as the discipline of suffering. What had become\nof Captain Lovelock and that tender passion which was apparently none\nthe less genuine for having been expressed in the slang of a humorous\nperiod? Had they been permanently separated by judicious guardians, and\nhad she been obliged to obliterate his image from her lightly-beating\nlittle heart? Bernard had felt sure at Baden that, beneath her\ncontemptuous airs and that impertinent consciousness of the difficulties\nof conquest by which a pretty American girl attests her allegiance to a\ncivilization in which young women occupy the highest place--he had felt\nsure that Blanche had a high appreciation of her handsome Englishman,\nand that if Lovelock should continue to relish her charms, he might\ncount upon the advantages of reciprocity. But it occurred to Bernard\nthat Captain Lovelock had perhaps been faithless; that, at least, the\ndiscourtesy of chance and the inhumanity of an elder brother might have\nkept him an eternal prisoner at the Hotel de Hollande (where, for\nall Bernard knew to the contrary, he had been obliged to work out his\ndestiny in the arduous character of a polyglot waiter); so that the poor\nyoung girl, casting backward glances along the path of Mrs. Vivian’s\nretreat, and failing to detect the onward rush of a rescuing cavalier,\nhad perforce believed herself forsaken, and had been obliged to summon\nphilosophy to her aid. It was very possible that her philosophic studies\nhad taught her the art of reflection; and that, as she would have said\nherself, she was tremendously toned down. Once, at Baden, when Gordon\nWright happened to take upon himself to remark that little Miss Evers\nwas bored by her English gallant, Bernard had ventured to observe,\nin petto, that Gordon knew nothing about it. But all this was of no\nconsequence now, and Bernard steered further and further away from the\nliability to detect fallacies in his friend. Gordon had engaged himself\nto marry, and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with\nthis resolution. It was a capital thing; it was just what he wanted; it\nwould do him a world of good. Bernard rejoiced with him sincerely, and\nregretted extremely that a series of solemn engagements to pay visits in\nEngland should prevent his being present at the nuptials.\n\nThey were well over, as I have said, when he reached New York. The\nhoneymoon had waned, and the business of married life had begun.\nBernard, at the end, had sailed from England rather abruptly. A friend\nwho had a remarkably good cabin on one of the steamers was obliged by a\nsudden detention to give it up, and on his offering it to Longueville,\nthe latter availed himself gratefully of this opportunity of being a\nlittle less discomposed than usual by the Atlantic billows. He therefore\nembarked at two days’ notice, a fortnight earlier than he had intended\nand than he had written to Gordon to expect him. Gordon, of course, had\nwritten that he was to seek no hospitality but that which Blanche was\nnow prepared--they had a charming house--so graciously to dispense;\nbut Bernard, nevertheless, leaving the ship early in the morning, had\nbetaken himself to an hotel. He wished not to anticipate his welcome,\nand he determined to report himself to Gordon first and to come back\nwith his luggage later in the day. After purifying himself of his\nsea-stains, he left his hotel and walked up the Fifth Avenue with all\na newly-landed voyager’s enjoyment of terrestrial locomotion. It was a\ncharming autumn day; there was a golden haze in the air; he supposed\nit was the Indian summer. The broad sidewalk of the Fifth Avenue was\nscattered over with dry leaves--crimson and orange and amber. He tossed\nthem with his stick as he passed; they rustled and murmured with the\nmotion, and it reminded him of the way he used to kick them in front of\nhim over these same pavements in his riotous infancy. It was a pleasure,\nafter many wanderings, to find himself in his native land again,\nand Bernard Longueville, as he went, paid his compliments to his\nmother-city. The brightness and gayety of the place seemed a greeting to\na returning son, and he felt a throb of affection for the freshest,\nthe youngest, the easiest and most good-natured of great capitals. On\npresenting himself at Gordon’s door, Bernard was told that the master of\nthe house was not at home; he went in, however, to see the mistress.\nShe was in her drawing-room, alone; she had on her bonnet, as if she had\nbeen going out. She gave him a joyous, demonstrative little welcome; she\nwas evidently very glad to see him. Bernard had thought it possible she\nhad “improved,” and she was certainly prettier than ever. He instantly\nperceived that she was still a chatterbox; it remained to be seen\nwhether the quality of her discourse were finer.\n\n“Well, Mr. Longueville,” she exclaimed, “where in the world did you drop\nfrom, and how long did it take you to cross the Atlantic? Three days,\neh? It could n’t have taken you many more, for it was only the other day\nthat Gordon told me you were not to sail till the 20th. You changed\nyour mind, eh? I did n’t know you ever changed your mind. Gordon never\nchanges his. That ‘s not a reason, eh, because you are not a bit like\nGordon. Well, I never thought you were, except that you are a man. Now\nwhat are you laughing at? What should you like me call you? You are a\nman, I suppose; you are not a god. That ‘s what you would like me\nto call you, I have no doubt. I must keep that for Gordon? I shall\ncertainly keep it a good while. I know a good deal more about gentlemen\nthan I did when I last saw you, and I assure you I don’t think they\nare a bit god-like. I suppose that ‘s why you always drop down from the\nsky--you think it ‘s more divine. I remember that ‘s the way you arrived\nat Baden when we were there together; the first thing we knew, you\nwere standing in the midst of us. Do you remember that evening when you\npresented yourself? You came up and touched Gordon on the shoulder, and\nhe gave a little jump. He will give another little jump when he sees you\nto-day. He gives a great many little jumps; I keep him skipping about!\nI remember perfectly the way we were sitting that evening at Baden, and\nthe way you looked at me when you came up. I saw you before Gordon--I\nsee a good many things before Gordon. What did you look at me that way\nfor? I always meant to ask you. I was dying to know.”\n\n“For the simplest reason in the world,” said Bernard. “Because you were\nso pretty.”\n\n“Ah no, it was n’t that! I know all about that look. It was something\nelse--as if you knew something about me. I don’t know what you can\nhave known. There was very little to know about me, except that I was\nintensely silly. Really, I was awfully silly that summer at Baden--you\nwould n’t believe how silly I was. But I don’t see how you could\nhave known that--before you had spoken to me. It came out in\nmy conversation--it came out awfully. My mother was a good deal\ndisappointed in Mrs. Vivian’s influence; she had expected so much from\nit. But it was not poor Mrs. Vivian’s fault, it was some one’s else.\nHave you ever seen the Vivians again? They are always in Europe; they\nhave gone to live in Paris. That evening when you came up and spoke to\nGordon, I never thought that three years afterward I should be married\nto him, and I don’t suppose you did either. Is that what you meant by\nlooking at me? Perhaps you can tell the future. I wish you would tell my\nfuture!”\n\n“Oh, I can tell that easily,” said Bernard.\n\n“What will happen to me?”\n\n“Nothing particular; it will be a little dull--the perfect happiness of\na charming woman married to the best fellow in the world.”\n\n“Ah, what a horrid future!” cried Blanche, with a little petulant cry.\n“I want to be happy, but I certainly don’t want to be dull. If you say\nthat again you will make me repent of having married the best fellow in\nthe world. I mean to be happy, but I certainly shall not be dull if I\ncan help it.”\n\n“I was wrong to say that,” said Bernard, “because, after all, my dear\nyoung lady, there must be an excitement in having so kind a husband\nas you have got. Gordon’s devotion is quite capable of taking a new\nform--of inventing a new kindness--every day in the year.”\n\nBlanche looked at him an instant, with less than her usual consciousness\nof her momentary pose.\n\n“My husband is very kind,” she said gently.\n\nShe had hardly spoken the words when Gordon came in. He stopped a moment\non seeing Bernard, glanced at his wife, blushed, flushed, and with a\nloud, frank exclamation of pleasure, grasped his friend by both hands.\nIt was so long since he had seen Bernard that he seemed a good deal\nmoved; he stood there smiling, clasping his hands, looking him in\nthe eyes, unable for some moments to speak. Bernard, on his side, was\ngreatly pleased; it was delightful to him to look into Gordon’s honest\nface again and to return his manly grasp. And he looked well--he looked\nhappy; to see that was more delightful yet. During these few instants,\nwhile they exchanged a silent pledge of renewed friendship, Bernard’s\nelastic perception embraced several things besides the consciousness of\nhis own pleasure. He saw that Gordon looked well and happy, but that he\nlooked older, too, and more serious, more marked by life. He looked as\nif something had happened to him--as, in fact, something had. Bernard\nsaw a latent spark in his friend’s eye that seemed to question his\nown for an impression of Blanche--to question it eagerly, and yet\nto deprecate judgment. He saw, too--with the fact made more vivid by\nGordon’s standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing\nit into contrast--that Blanche was the same little posturing coquette of\na Blanche whom, at Baden, he would have treated it as a broad joke that\nGordon Wright should dream of marrying. He saw, in a word, that it was\nwhat it had first struck him as being--an incongruous union. All this\nwas a good deal for Bernard to see in the course of half a minute,\nespecially through the rather opaque medium of a feeling of irreflective\njoy; and his impressions at this moment have a value only in so far as\nthey were destined to be confirmed by larger opportunity.\n\n“You have come a little sooner than we expected,” said Gordon; “but you\nare all the more welcome.”\n\n“It was rather a risk,” Blanche observed. “One should be notified, when\none wishes to make a good impression.”\n\n“Ah, my dear lady,” said Bernard, “you made your impression--as far as I\nam concerned--a long time ago, and I doubt whether it would have gained\nanything to-day by your having prepared an effect.”\n\nThey were standing before the fire-place, on the great hearth-rug, and\nBlanche, while she listened to this speech, was feeling, with uplifted\narm, for a curl that had strayed from her chignon.\n\n“She prepares her effects very quickly,” said Gordon, laughing gently.\n“They follow each other very fast!”\n\nBlanche kept her hand behind her head, which was bent slightly forward;\nher bare arm emerged from her hanging sleeve, and, with her eyes\nglancing upward from under her lowered brows, she smiled at her two\nspectators. Her husband laid his hand on Bernard’s arm.\n\n“Is n’t she pretty?” he cried; and he spoke with a sort of tender\ndelight in being sure at least of this point.\n\n“Tremendously pretty!” said Bernard. “I told her so half an hour before\nyou came in.”\n\n“Ah, it was time I should arrive!” Gordon exclaimed.\n\nBlanche was manifestly not in the least discomposed by this frank\ndiscussion of her charms, for the air of distinguished esteem adopted by\nboth of her companions diminished the crudity of their remarks. But\nshe gave a little pout of irritated modesty--it was more becoming than\nanything she had done yet--and declared that if they wished to talk her\nover, they were very welcome; but she should prefer their waiting till\nshe got out of the room. So she left them, reminding Bernard that he\nwas to send for his luggage and remain, and promising to give immediate\norders for the preparation of his apartment. Bernard opened the door for\nher to pass out; she gave him a charming nod as he stood there, and\nhe turned back to Gordon with the reflection of her smile in his face.\nGordon was watching him; Gordon was dying to know what he thought of\nher. It was a curious mania of Gordon’s, this wanting to know what one\nthought of the women he loved; but Bernard just now felt abundantly able\nto humor it. He was so pleased at seeing him tightly married.\n\n“She ‘s a delightful creature,” Bernard said, with cordial vagueness,\nshaking hands with his friend again.\n\nGordon glanced at him a moment, and then, coloring a little, looked\nstraight out of the window; whereupon Bernard remembered that these were\njust the terms in which, at Baden, after his companion’s absence, he\nhad attempted to qualify Angela Vivian. Gordon was conscious--he was\nconscious of the oddity of his situation.\n\n“Of course it surprised you,” he said, in a moment, still looking out of\nthe window.\n\n“What, my dear fellow?”\n\n“My marriage.”\n\n“Well, you know,” said Bernard, “everything surprises me. I am of a very\nconjectural habit of mind. All sorts of ideas come into my head, and yet\nwhen the simplest things happen I am always rather startled. I live in a\nreverie, and I am perpetually waked up by people doing things.”\n\nGordon transferred his eyes from the window to Bernard’s face--to his\nwhole person.\n\n“You are waked up? But you fall asleep again!”\n\n“I fall asleep very easily,” said Bernard.\n\nGordon looked at him from head to foot, smiling and shaking his head.\n\n“You are not changed,” he said. “You have travelled in unknown lands;\nyou have had, I suppose, all sorts of adventures; but you are the same\nman I used to know.”\n\n“I am sorry for that!”\n\n“You have the same way of representing--of misrepresenting, yourself.”\n\n“Well, if I am not changed,” said Bernard, “I can ill afford to lose so\nvaluable an art.”\n\n“Taking you altogether, I am glad you are the same,” Gordon answered,\nsimply; “but you must come into my part of the house.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nYes, he was conscious--he was very conscious; so Bernard reflected\nduring the two or three first days of his visit to his friend. Gordon\nknew it must seem strange to so irreverent a critic that a man who had\nonce aspired to the hand of so intelligent a girl--putting other things\naside--as Angela Vivian should, as the Ghost in “Hamlet” says, have\n“declined upon” a young lady who, in force of understanding, was so very\nmuch Miss Vivian’s inferior; and this knowledge kept him ill at his\nease and gave him a certain pitiable awkwardness. Bernard’s sense of\nthe anomaly grew rapidly less acute; he made various observations which\nhelped it to seem natural. Blanche was wonderfully pretty; she was very\ngraceful, innocent, amusing. Since Gordon had determined to marry a\nlittle goose, he had chosen the animal with extreme discernment. It had\nquite the plumage of a swan, and it sailed along the stream of life with\nan extraordinary lightness of motion. He asked himself indeed at times\nwhether Blanche were really so silly as she seemed; he doubted whether\nany woman could be so silly as Blanche seemed. He had a suspicion at\ntimes that, for ends of her own, she was playing a part--the suspicion\narising from the fact that, as usually happens in such cases, she\nover-played it. Her empty chatter, her futility, her childish coquetry\nand frivolity--such light wares could hardly be the whole substance of\nany woman’s being; there was something beneath them which Blanche was\nkeeping out of sight. She had a scrap of a mind somewhere, and even a\nlittle particle of a heart. If one looked long enough one might catch a\nglimpse of these possessions. But why should she keep them out of sight,\nand what were the ends that she proposed to serve by this uncomfortable\nperversity? Bernard wondered whether she were fond of her husband, and\nhe heard it intimated by several good people in New York who had had\nsome observation of the courtship, that she had married him for his\nmoney. He was very sorry to find that this was taken for granted, and he\ndetermined, on the whole, not to believe it. He was disgusted with the\nidea of such a want of gratitude; for, if Gordon Wright had loved Miss\nEvers for herself, the young lady might certainly have discovered the\nintrinsic value of so disinterested a suitor. Her mother had the credit\nof having made the match. Gordon was known to be looking for a wife;\nMrs. Evers had put her little feather-head of a daughter very much\nforward, and Gordon was as easily captivated as a child by the sound of\na rattle. Blanche had an affection for him now, however; Bernard saw no\nreason to doubt that, and certainly she would have been a very flimsy\ncreature indeed if she had not been touched by his inexhaustible\nkindness. She had every conceivable indulgence, and if she married him\nfor his money, at least she had got what she wanted. She led the most\nagreeable life conceivable, and she ought to be in high good-humor.\nIt was impossible to have a prettier house, a prettier carriage, more\njewels and laces for the adornment of a plump little person. It was\nimpossible to go to more parties, to give better dinners, to have fewer\nprivations or annoyances. Bernard was so much struck with all this that,\nadvancing rapidly in the intimacy of his gracious hostess, he ventured\nto call her attention to her blessings. She answered that she was\nperfectly aware of them, and there was no pretty speech she was not\nprepared to make about Gordon.\n\n“I know what you want to say,” she went on; “you want to say that he\nspoils me, and I don’t see why you should hesitate. You generally say\neverything you want, and you need n’t be afraid of me. He does n’t spoil\nme, simply because I am so bad I can’t be spoiled; but that ‘s of no\nconsequence. I was spoiled ages ago; every one spoiled me--every one\nexcept Mrs. Vivian. I was always fond of having everything I want, and I\ngenerally managed to get it. I always had lovely clothes; mamma thought\nthat was a kind of a duty. If it was a duty, I don’t suppose it counts\nas a part of the spoiling. But I was very much indulged, and I know I\nhave everything now. Gordon is a perfect husband; I believe if I were\nto ask him for a present of his nose, he would cut it off and give it\nto me. I think I will ask him for a small piece of it some day; it\nwill rather improve him to have an inch or two less. I don’t say he ‘s\nhandsome; but he ‘s just as good as he can be. Some people say that\nif you are very fond of a person you always think them handsome; but I\ndon’t agree with that at all. I am very fond of Gordon, and yet I am\nnot blinded by affection, as regards his personal appearance. He ‘s too\nlight for my taste, and too red. And because you think people handsome,\nit does n’t follow that you are fond of them. I used to have a friend\nwho was awfully handsome--the handsomest man I ever saw--and I was\nperfectly conscious of his defects. But I ‘m not conscious of Gordon’s,\nand I don’t believe he has got any. He ‘s so intensely kind; it ‘s quite\npathetic. One would think he had done me an injury in marrying me, and\nthat he wanted to make up for it. If he has done me an injury I have n’t\ndiscovered it yet, and I don’t believe I ever shall. I certainly shall\nnot as long as he lets me order all the clothes I want. I have ordered\nfive dresses this week, and I mean to order two more. When I told\nGordon, what do you think he did? He simply kissed me. Well, if that ‘s\nnot expressive, I don’t know what he could have done. He kisses me about\nseventeen times a day. I suppose it ‘s very improper for a woman to tell\nany one how often her husband kisses her; but, as you happen to have\nseen him do it, I don’t suppose you will be scandalized. I know you are\nnot easily scandalized; I am not afraid of you. You are scandalized at\nmy getting so many dresses? Well, I told you I was spoiled--I freely\nacknowledge it. That ‘s why I was afraid to tell Gordon--because when I\nwas married I had such a lot of things; I was supposed to have dresses\nenough to last for a year. But Gordon had n’t to pay for them, so there\nwas no harm in my letting him feel that he has a wife. If he thinks I am\nextravagant, he can easily stop kissing me. You don’t think it would be\neasy to stop? It ‘s very well, then, for those that have never begun!”\n\nBernard had a good deal of conversation with Blanche, of which, so far\nas she was concerned, the foregoing remarks may serve as a specimen.\nGordon was away from home during much of the day; he had a chemical\nlaboratory in which he was greatly interested, and which he took Bernard\nto see; it was fitted up with the latest contrivances for the pursuit\nof experimental science, and was the resort of needy young students,\nwho enjoyed, at Gordon’s expense, the opportunity for pushing their\nresearches. The place did great honor to Gordon’s liberality and to his\ningenuity; but Blanche, who had also paid it a visit, could never speak\nof it without a pretty little shudder.\n\n“Nothing would induce me to go there again,” she declared, “and I\nconsider myself very fortunate to have escaped from it with my life. It\n‘s filled with all sorts of horrible things, that fizzle up and go off,\nor that make you turn some dreadful color if you look at them. I expect\nto hear a great clap some day, and half an hour afterward to see Gordon\nbrought home in several hundred small pieces, put up in a dozen little\nbottles. I got a horrid little stain in the middle of my dress that one\nof the young men--the young savants--was so good as to drop there. Did\nyou see the young savants who work under Gordon’s orders? I thought they\nwere too forlorn; there is n’t one of them you would look at. If you can\nbelieve it, there was n’t one of them that looked at me; they took no\nmore notice of me than if I had been the charwoman. They might have\nshown me some attention, at least, as the wife of the proprietor. What\nis it that Gordon ‘s called--is n’t there some other name? If you say\n‘proprietor,’ it sounds as if he kept an hotel. I certainly don’t want\nto pass for the wife of an hotel-keeper. What does he call himself? He\nmust have some name. I hate telling people he ‘s a chemist; it sounds\njust as if he kept a shop. That ‘s what they call the druggists in\nEngland, and I formed the habit while I was there. It makes me feel\nas if he were some dreadful little man, with big green bottles in\nthe window and ‘night-bell’ painted outside. He does n’t call himself\nanything? Well, that ‘s exactly like Gordon! I wonder he consents to\nhave a name at all. When I was telling some one about the young men who\nwork under his orders--the young savants--he said I must not say that--I\nmust not speak of their working ‘under his orders.’ I don’t know what he\nwould like me to say! Under his inspiration!”\n\nDuring the hours of Gordon’s absence, Bernard had frequent colloquies\nwith his friend’s wife, whose irresponsible prattle amused him, and in\nwhom he tried to discover some faculty, some quality, which might be a\npositive guarantee of Gordon’s future felicity. But often, of course,\nGordon was an auditor as well; I say an auditor, because it seemed\nto Bernard that he had grown to be less of a talker than of yore.\nDoubtless, when a man finds himself united to a garrulous wife, he\nnaturally learns to hold his tongue; but sometimes, at the close of one\nof Blanche’s discursive monologues, on glancing at her husband just to\nsee how he took it, and seeing him sit perfectly silent, with a fixed,\ninexpressive smile, Bernard said to himself that Gordon found the lesson\nof listening attended with some embarrassments. Gordon, as the years\nwent by, was growing a little inscrutable; but this, too, in certain\ncircumstances, was a usual tendency. The operations of the mind, with\ndeepening experience, became more complex, and people were less apt to\nemit immature reflections at forty than they had been in their earlier\ndays. Bernard felt a great kindness in these days for his old friend; he\nnever yet had seemed to him such a good fellow, nor appealed so strongly\nto the benevolence of his disposition. Sometimes, of old, Gordon used to\nirritate him; but this danger appeared completely to have passed away.\nBernard prolonged his visit; it gave him pleasure to be able to testify\nin this manner to his good will. Gordon was the kindest of hosts, and\nif in conversation, when his wife was present, he gave precedence to\nher superior powers, he had at other times a good deal of pleasant\nbachelor-talk with his guest. He seemed very happy; he had plenty of\noccupation and plenty of practical intentions. The season went on, and\nBernard enjoyed his life. He enjoyed the keen and brilliant American\nwinter, and he found it very pleasant to be treated as a distinguished\nstranger in his own land--a situation to which his long and repeated\nabsences had relegated him. The hospitality of New York was profuse;\nthe charm of its daughters extreme; the radiance of its skies superb.\nBernard was the restless and professionless mortal that we know,\nwandering in life from one vague experiment to another, constantly\ngratified and never satisfied, to whom no imperious finality had as yet\npresented itself; and, nevertheless, for a time he contrived to limit\nhis horizon to the passing hour, and to make a good many hours pass in\nthe drawing-room of a demonstrative flirt.\n\nFor Mrs. Gordon was a flirt; that had become tolerably obvious. Bernard\nhad known of old that Blanche Evers was one, and two or three months’\nobservation of his friend’s wife assured him that she did not judge\na certain ethereal coquetry to be inconsistent with the conjugal\ncharacter. Blanche flirted, in fact, more or less with all men, but\nher opportunity for playing her harmless batteries upon Bernard were of\ncourse exceptionally large. The poor fellow was perpetually under fire,\nand it was inevitable that he should reply with some precision of aim.\nIt seemed to him all child’s play, and it is certain that when his back\nwas turned to his pretty hostess he never found himself thinking of\nher. He had not the least reason to suppose that she thought of\nhim--excessive concentration of mind was the last vice of which he\naccused her. But before the winter was over, he discovered that Mrs.\nGordon Wright was being talked about, and that his own name was, as the\nnewspapers say, mentioned in connection with that of his friend’s wife.\nThe discovery greatly disgusted him; Bernard Longueville’s chronicler\nmust do him the justice to say that it failed to yield him an even\ntransient thrill of pleasure. He thought it very improbable that this\nvulgar rumor had reached Gordon’s ears; but he nevertheless--very\nnaturally--instantly made up his mind to leave the house. He lost\nno time in saying to Gordon that he had suddenly determined to go to\nCalifornia, and that he was sure he must be glad to get rid of him.\nGordon expressed no surprise and no regret. He simply laid his hand on\nhis shoulder and said, very quietly, looking at him in the eyes--\n\n“Very well; the pleasantest things must come to an end.”\n\nIt was not till an hour afterwards that Bernard said to himself that his\nfriend’s manner of receiving the announcement of his departure had been\nrather odd. He had neither said a word about his staying longer nor\nurged him to come back again, and there had been (it now seemed to\nBernard) an audible undertone of relief in the single sentence with\nwhich he assented to his visitor’s withdrawal. Could it be possible that\npoor Gordon was jealous of him, that he had heard this loathsome gossip,\nor that his own observation had given him an alarm? He had certainly\nnever betrayed the smallest sense of injury; but it was to be remembered\nthat even if he were uneasy, Gordon was quite capable, with his\ncharacteristic habit of weighing everything, his own honor included, in\nscrupulously adjusted scales, of denying himself the luxury of active\nsuspicion. He would never have let a half suspicion make a difference\nin his conduct, and he would not have dissimulated; he would simply have\nresisted belief. His hospitality had been without a flaw, and if he\nhad really been wishing Bernard out of his house, he had behaved with\nadmirable self-control. Bernard, however, followed this train of thought\na very short distance. It was odious to him to believe that he could\nhave appeared to Gordon, however guiltlessly, to have invaded even in\nimagination the mystic line of the marital monopoly; not to say that,\nmoreover, if one came to that, he really cared about as much for poor\nlittle Blanche as for the weather-cock on the nearest steeple. He simply\nhurried his preparations for departure, and he told Blanche that he\nshould have to bid her farewell on the following day. He had found her\nin the drawing-room, waiting for dinner. She was expecting company to\ndine, and Gordon had not yet come down.\n\nShe was sitting in the vague glow of the fire-light, in a wonderful blue\ndress, with two little blue feet crossed on the rug and pointed at the\nhearth. She received Bernard’s announcement with small satisfaction, and\nexpended a great deal of familiar ridicule on his project of a journey\nto California. Then, suddenly getting up and looking at him a moment--\n\n“I know why you are going,” she said.\n\n“I am glad to hear my explanations have not been lost.”\n\n“Your explanations are all nonsense. You are going for another reason.”\n\n“Well,” said Bernard, “if you insist upon it, it ‘s because you are too\nsharp with me.”\n\n“It ‘s because of me. So much as that is true.” Bernard wondered what\nshe was going to say--if she were going to be silly enough to allude to\nthe most impudent of fictions; then, as she stood opening and closing\nher blue fan and smiling at him in the fire-light, he felt that she was\nsilly enough for anything. “It ‘s because of all the talk--it ‘s because\nof Gordon. You need n’t be afraid of Gordon.”\n\n“Afraid of him? I don’t know what you mean,” said Bernard, gravely.\n\nBlanche gave a little laugh.\n\n“You have discovered that people are talking about us--about you and\nme. I must say I wonder you care. I don’t care, and if it ‘s because\nof Gordon, you might as well know that he does n’t care. If he does\nn’t care, I don’t see why I should; and if I don’t, I don’t see why you\nshould!”\n\n“You pay too much attention to such insipid drivel in even mentioning\nit.”\n\n“Well, if I have the credit of saying what I should n’t--to you or\nto any one else--I don’t see why I should n’t have the advantage too.\nGordon does n’t care--he does n’t care what I do or say. He does n’t\ncare a pin for me!”\n\nShe spoke in her usual rattling, rambling voice, and brought out this\ndeclaration with a curious absence of resentment.\n\n“You talk about advantage,” said Bernard. “I don’t see what advantage it\nis to you to say that.”\n\n“I want to--I must--I will! That ‘s the advantage!” This came out with a\nsudden sharpness of tone; she spoke more excitedly. “He does n’t care a\nbutton for me, and he never did! I don’t know what he married me for. He\ncares for something else--he thinks of something else. I don’t know what\nit is--I suppose it ‘s chemistry!”\n\nThese words gave Bernard a certain shock, but he had his intelligence\nsufficiently in hand to contradict them with energy.\n\n“You labor under a monstrous delusion,” he exclaimed. “Your husband\nthinks you fascinating.”\n\nThis epithet, pronounced with a fine distinctness, was ringing in the\nair when the door opened and Gordon came in. He looked for a moment from\nBernard to his wife, and then, approaching the latter, he said, softly--\n\n“Do you know that he leaves us to-morrow?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nBernard left then and went to California; but when he arrived there\nhe asked himself why he had come, and was unable to mention any other\nreason than that he had announced it. He began to feel restless again,\nand to drift back to that chronic chagrin which had accompanied him\nthrough his long journey in the East. He succeeded, however, in keeping\nthese unreasonable feelings at bay for some time, and he strove to\noccupy himself, to take an interest in Californian problems. Bernard,\nhowever, was neither an economist nor a cattle-fancier, and he found\nthat, as the phrase is, there was not a great deal to take hold of. He\nwandered about, admired the climate and the big peaches, thought a while\nof going to Japan, and ended by going to Mexico. In this way he passed\nseveral months, and justified, in the eyes of other people at least,\nhis long journey across the Continent. At last he made it again, in the\nopposite sense. He went back to New York, where the summer had already\nbegun, and here he invented a solution for the difficulty presented by\nlife to a culpably unoccupied and ill-regulated man. The solution was\nnot in the least original, and I am almost ashamed to mention so stale\nand conventional a device. Bernard simply hit upon the plan of returning\nto Europe. Such as it was, however, he carried it out with an audacity\nworthy of a better cause, and was sensibly happier since he had made up\nhis mind to it. Gordon Wright and his wife were out of town, but Bernard\nwent into the country, as boldly as you please, to inform them of\nhis little project and take a long leave of them. He had made his\narrangements to sail immediately, and, as at such short notice it was\nimpossible to find good quarters on one of the English vessels, he had\nengaged a berth on a French steamer, which would convey him to Havre. On\ngoing down to Gordon’s house in the country, he was conscious of a good\ndeal of eagerness to know what had become of that latent irritation\nof which Blanche had given him a specimen. Apparently it had quite\nsubsided; Blanche was wreathed in smiles; she was living in a bower of\nroses. Bernard, indeed, had no opportunity for investigating her state\nof mind, for he found several people in the house, and Blanche, who had\nan exalted standard of the duties of a hostess, was occupied in making\nlife agreeable to her guests, most of whom were gentlemen. She had\nin this way that great remedy for dissatisfaction which Bernard\nlacked--something interesting to do. Bernard felt a good deal of genuine\nsadness in taking leave of Gordon, to whom he contrived to feel even\nmore kindly than in earlier days. He had quite forgotten that Gordon\nwas jealous of him--which he was not, as Bernard said. Certainly, Gordon\nshowed nothing of it now, and nothing could have been more friendly than\ntheir parting. Gordon, also, for a man who was never boisterous, seemed\nvery contented. He was fond of exercising hospitality, and he confessed\nto Bernard that he was just now in the humor for having his house full\nof people. Fortune continued to gratify this generous taste; for just as\nBernard was coming away another guest made his appearance. The new-comer\nwas none other than the Honourable Augustus Lovelock, who had just\narrived in New York, and who, as he added, had long desired to visit the\nUnited States. Bernard merely witnessed his arrival, and was struck\nwith the fact that as he presented himself--it seemed quite a\nsurprise--Blanche really stopped chattering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nI have called it a stale expedient on Bernard Longueville’s part to “go\nto Europe” again, like the most commonplace American; and it is certain\nthat, as our young man stood and looked out of the window of his inn at\nHavre, an hour after his arrival at that sea-port, his adventure did\nnot strike him as having any great freshness. He had no plans nor\nintentions; he had not even any very definite desires. He had felt the\nimpulse to come back to Europe, and he had obeyed it; but now that he\nhad arrived, his impulse seemed to have little more to say to him. He\nperceived it, indeed--mentally--in the attitude of a small street-boy\nplaying upon his nose with that vulgar gesture which is supposed to\nrepresent the elation of successful fraud. There was a large blank wall\nbefore his window, painted a dirty yellow and much discolored by the\nweather; a broad patch of summer sunlight rested upon it and brought\nout the full vulgarity of its complexion. Bernard stared a while at\nthis blank wall, which struck him in some degree as a symbol of his\nown present moral prospect. Then suddenly he turned away, with the\ndeclaration that, whatever truth there might be in symbolism, he, at any\nrate, had not come to Europe to spend the precious remnant of his youth\nin a malodorous Norman sea-port. The weather was very hot, and neither\nthe hotel nor the town at large appeared to form an attractive sejour\nfor persons of an irritable nostril. To go to Paris, however, was hardly\nmore attractive than to remain at Havre, for Bernard had a lively vision\nof the heated bitumen and the glaring frontages of the French capital.\nBut if a Norman town was close and dull, the Norman country was\nnotoriously fresh and entertaining, and the next morning Bernard got\ninto a caleche, with his luggage, and bade its proprietor drive him\nalong the coast. Once he had begun to rumble through this charming\nlandscape, he was in much better humor with his situation; the air was\nfreshened by a breeze from the sea; the blooming country, without walls\nor fences, lay open to the traveller’s eye; the grain-fields and copses\nwere shimmering in the summer wind; the pink-faced cottages peeped\nthrough the ripening orchard-boughs, and the gray towers of the old\nchurches were silvered by the morning-light of France.\n\nAt the end of some three hours, Bernard arrived at a little\nwatering-place which lay close upon the shore, in the embrace of a\npair of white-armed cliffs. It had a quaint and primitive aspect and a\nnatural picturesqueness which commended it to Bernard’s taste. There was\nevidently a great deal of nature about it, and at this moment, nature,\nembodied in the clear, gay sunshine, in the blue and quiet sea, in the\ndaisied grass of the high-shouldered downs, had an air of inviting the\nintelligent observer to postpone his difficulties. Blanquais-les-Galets,\nas Bernard learned the name of this unfashionable resort to be, was\ntwenty miles from a railway, and the place wore an expression of\nunaffected rusticity. Bernard stopped at an inn for his noonday\nbreakfast, and then, with his appreciation quickened by the homely\nfelicity of this repast, determined to go no further. He engaged a\nroom at the inn, dismissed his vehicle, and gave himself up to the\ncontemplation of French sea-side manners. These were chiefly to be\nobserved upon a pebbly strand which lay along the front of the village\nand served as the gathering-point of its idler inhabitants. Bathing in\nthe sea was the chief occupation of these good people, including, as it\ndid, prolonged spectatorship of the process and infinite conversation\nupon its mysteries. The little world of Blanquais appeared to form a\nlarge family party, of highly developed amphibious habits, which sat\ngossiping all day upon the warm pebbles, occasionally dipping into the\nsea and drying itself in the sun, without any relaxation of personal\nintimacy. All this was very amusing to Bernard, who in the course of the\nday took a bath with the rest. The ocean was, after all, very large, and\nwhen one took one’s plunge one seemed to have it quite to one’s self.\nWhen he had dressed himself again, Bernard stretched himself on the\nbeach, feeling happier than he had done in a long time, and pulled his\nhat over his eyes. The feeling of happiness was an odd one; it had come\nover him suddenly, without visible cause; but, such as it was, our hero\nmade the most of it. As he lay there it seemed to deepen; his immersion\nand his exercise in the salt water had given him an agreeable languor.\nThis presently became a drowsiness which was not less agreeable, and\nBernard felt himself going to sleep. There were sounds in the air above\nhis head--sounds of the crunching and rattling of the loose, smooth\nstones as his neighbors moved about on them; of high-pitched French\nvoices exchanging colloquial cries; of the plash of the bathers in the\ndistant water, and the short, soft breaking of the waves. But these\nthings came to his ears more vaguely and remotely, and at last they\nfaded away. Bernard enjoyed half an hour of that light and easy slumber\nwhich is apt to overtake idle people in recumbent attitudes in the open\nair on August afternoons. It brought with it an exquisite sense of\nrest, and the rest was not spoiled by the fact that it was animated by a\ncharming dream. Dreams are vague things, and this one had the defects of\nits species; but it was somehow concerned with the image of a young\nlady whom Bernard had formerly known, and who had beautiful eyes, into\nwhich--in the dream--he found himself looking. He waked up to find\nhimself looking into the crown of his hat, which had been resting on the\nbridge of his nose. He removed it, and half raised himself, resting on\nhis elbow and preparing to taste, in another position, of a little more\nof that exquisite rest of which mention has just been made. The world\nabout him was still amusing and charming; the chatter of his companions,\nlosing itself in the large sea-presence, the plash of the divers and\nswimmers, the deep blue of the ocean and the silvery white of the cliff,\nhad that striking air of indifference to the fact that his mind had been\nabsent from them which we are apt to find in mundane things on emerging\nfrom a nap. The same people were sitting near him on the beach--the\nsame, and yet not quite the same. He found himself noticing a person\nwhom he had not noticed before--a young lady, who was seated in a low\nportable chair, some dozen yards off, with her eyes bent upon a book.\nHer head was in shade; her large parasol made, indeed, an awning for\nher whole person, which in this way, in the quiet attitude of perusal,\nseemed to abstract itself from the glare and murmur of the beach. The\nclear shadow of her umbrella--it was lined with blue--was deep upon her\nface; but it was not deep enough to prevent Bernard from recognizing\na profile that he knew. He suddenly sat upright, with an intensely\nquickened vision. Was he dreaming still, or had he waked? In a moment he\nfelt that he was acutely awake; he heard her, across the interval, turn\nthe page of her book. For a single instant, as she did so, she looked\nwith level brows at the glittering ocean; then, lowering her eyes, she\nwent on with her reading. In this barely perceptible movement he saw\nAngela Vivian; it was wonderful how well he remembered her. She was\nevidently reading very seriously; she was much interested in her book.\nShe was alone; Bernard looked about for her mother, but Mrs. Vivian\nwas not in sight. By this time Bernard had become aware that he was\nagitated; the exquisite rest of a few moments before had passed away.\nHis agitation struck him as unreasonable; in a few minutes he made up\nhis mind that it was absurd. He had done her an injury--yes; but as she\nsat there losing herself in a French novel--Bernard could see it was a\nFrench novel--he could not make out that she was the worse for it. It\nhad not affected her appearance; Miss Vivian was still a handsome girl.\nBernard hoped she would not look toward him or recognize him; he wished\nto look at her at his ease; to think it over; to make up his mind. The\nidea of meeting Angela Vivian again had often come into his thoughts;\nI may, indeed, say that it was a tolerably familiar presence there; but\nthe fact, nevertheless, now presented itself with all the violence of an\naccident for which he was totally unprepared. He had often asked himself\nwhat he should say to her, how he should carry himself, and how he\nshould probably find the young lady; but, with whatever ingenuity he\nmight at the moment have answered these questions, his intelligence at\npresent felt decidedly overtaxed. She was a very pretty girl to whom he\nhad done a wrong; this was the final attitude into which, with a good\ndeal of preliminary shifting and wavering, she had settled in his\nrecollection. The wrong was a right, doubtless, from certain points of\nview; but from the girl’s own it could only seem an injury to which its\nhaving been inflicted by a clever young man with whom she had been on\nagreeable terms, necessarily added a touch of baseness.\n\nIn every disadvantage that a woman suffers at the hands of a man, there\nis inevitably, in what concerns the man, an element of cowardice. When I\nsay “inevitably,” I mean that this is what the woman sees in it. This is\nwhat Bernard believed that Angela Vivian saw in the fact that by giving\nhis friend a bad account of her he had prevented her making an opulent\nmarriage. At first he had said to himself that, whether he had held\nhis tongue or spoken, she had already lost her chance; but with time,\nsomehow, this reflection had lost its weight in the scale. It conveyed\nlittle re-assurance to his irritated conscience--it had become\nimponderable and impertinent. At the moment of which I speak it entirely\nfailed to present itself, even for form’s sake; and as he sat looking\nat this superior creature who came back to him out of an episode of his\npast, he thought of her simply as an unprotected woman toward whom he\nhad been indelicate. It is not an agreeable thing for a delicate man\nlike Bernard Longueville to have to accommodate himself to such an\naccident, but this is nevertheless what it seemed needful that he should\ndo. If she bore him a grudge he must think it natural; if she had vowed\nhim a hatred he must allow her the comfort of it. He had done the only\nthing possible, but that made it no better for her. He had wronged her.\nThe circumstances mattered nothing, and as he could not make it up\nto her, the only reasonable thing was to keep out of her way. He had\nstepped into her path now, and the proper thing was to step out of it.\nIf it could give her no pleasure to see him again, it could certainly do\nhim no good to see her. He had seen her by this time pretty well--as far\nas mere seeing went, and as yet, apparently, he was none the worse for\nthat; but his hope that he should himself escape unperceived had now\nbecome acute. It is singular that this hope should not have led him\ninstantly to turn his back and move away; but the explanation of his\nimprudent delay is simply that he wished to see a little more of Miss\nVivian. He was unable to bring himself to the point. Those clever things\nthat he might have said to her quite faded away. The only good taste was\nto take himself off, and spare her the trouble of inventing civilities\nthat she could not feel. And yet he continued to sit there from moment\nto moment, arrested, detained, fascinated, by the accident of her not\nlooking round--of her having let him watch her so long. She turned\nanother page, and another, and her reading absorbed her still. He was\nso near her that he could have touched her dress with the point of his\numbrella. At last she raised her eyes and rested them a while on the\nblue horizon, straight in front of her, but as yet without turning them\naside. This, however, augmented the danger of her doing so, and Bernard,\nwith a good deal of an effort, rose to his feet. The effort, doubtless,\nkept the movement from being either as light or as swift as it might\nhave been, and it vaguely attracted his neighbor’s attention. She turned\nher head and glanced at him, with a glance that evidently expected\nbut to touch him and pass. It touched him, and it was on the point of\npassing; then it suddenly checked itself; she had recognized him. She\nlooked at him, straight and open-eyed, out of the shadow of her parasol,\nand Bernard stood there--motionless now--receiving her gaze. How long it\nlasted need not be narrated. It was probably a matter of a few seconds,\nbut to Bernard it seemed a little eternity. He met her eyes, he looked\nstraight into her face; now that she had seen him he could do nothing\nelse. Bernard’s little eternity, however, came to an end; Miss Vivian\ndropped her eyes upon her book again. She let them rest upon it only a\nmoment; then she closed it and slowly rose from her chair, turning\naway from Bernard. He still stood looking at her--stupidly, foolishly,\nhelplessly enough, as it seemed to him; no sign of recognition had been\nexchanged. Angela Vivian hesitated a minute; she now had her back turned\nto him, and he fancied her light, flexible figure was agitated by her\nindecision. She looked along the sunny beach which stretched its shallow\ncurve to where the little bay ended and the white wall of the cliffs\nbegan. She looked down toward the sea, and up toward the little Casino\nwhich was perched on a low embankment, communicating with the beach at\ntwo or three points by a short flight of steps. Bernard saw--or supposed\nhe saw--that she was asking herself whither she had best turn to avoid\nhim. He had not blushed when she looked at him--he had rather turned\na little pale; but he blushed now, for it really seemed odious to have\nliterally driven the poor girl to bay. Miss Vivian decided to take\nrefuge in the Casino, and she passed along one of the little pathways\nof planks that were laid here and there across the beach, and directed\nherself to the nearest flight of steps. Before she had gone two paces\na complete change came over Bernard’s feeling; his only wish now was\nto speak to her--to explain--to tell her he would go away. There was\nanother row of steps at a short distance behind him; he rapidly ascended\nthem and reached the little terrace of the Casino. Miss Vivian stood\nthere; she was apparently hesitating again which way to turn. Bernard\ncame straight up to her, with a gallant smile and a greeting. The\ncomparison is a coarse one, but he felt that he was taking the bull by\nthe horns. Angela Vivian stood watching him arrive.\n\n“You did n’t recognize me,” he said, “and your not recognizing me made\nme--made me hesitate.”\n\nFor a moment she said nothing, and then--\n\n“You are more timid than you used to be!” she answered.\n\nHe could hardly have said what expression he had expected to find in her\nface; his apprehension had, perhaps, not painted her obtrusively pale\nand haughty, aggressively cold and stern; but it had figured something\ndifferent from the look he encountered. Miss Vivian was simply\nblushing--that was what Bernard mainly perceived; he saw that her\nsurprise had been extreme--complete. Her blush was re-assuring; it\ncontradicted the idea of impatient resentment, and Bernard took some\nsatisfaction in noting that it was prolonged.\n\n“Yes, I am more timid than I used to be,” he said.\n\nIn spite of her blush, she continued to look at him very directly; but\nshe had always done that--she always met one’s eye; and Bernard now\ninstantly found all the beauty that he had ever found before in her\npure, unevasive glance.\n\n“I don’t know whether I am more brave,” she said; “but I must tell the\ntruth--I instantly recognized you.”\n\n“You gave no sign!”\n\n“I supposed I gave a striking one--in getting up and going away.”\n\n“Ah!” said Bernard, “as I say, I am more timid than I was, and I did n’t\nventure to interpret that as a sign of recognition.”\n\n“It was a sign of surprise.”\n\n“Not of pleasure!” said Bernard. He felt this to be a venturesome, and\nfrom the point of view of taste perhaps a reprehensible, remark; but he\nmade it because he was now feeling his ground, and it seemed better to\nmake it gravely than with assumed jocosity.\n\n“Great surprises are to me never pleasures,” Angela answered; “I am not\nfond of shocks of any kind. The pleasure is another matter. I have not\nyet got over my surprise.”\n\n“If I had known you were here, I would have written to you beforehand,”\n said Bernard, laughing.\n\nMiss Vivian, beneath her expanded parasol, gave a little shrug of her\nshoulders.\n\n“Even that would have been a surprise.”\n\n“You mean a shock, eh? Did you suppose I was dead?”\n\nNow, at last, she lowered her eyes, and her blush slowly died away.\n\n“I knew nothing about it.”\n\n“Of course you could n’t know, and we are all mortal. It was natural\nthat you should n’t expect--simply on turning your head--to find me\nlying on the pebbles at Blanquais-les-Galets. You were a great surprise\nto me, as well; but I differ from you--I like surprises.”\n\n“It is rather refreshing to hear that one is a surprise,” said the girl.\n\n“Especially when in that capacity one is liked!” Bernard exclaimed.\n\n“I don’t say that--because such sensations pass away. I am now beginning\nto get over mine.”\n\nThe light mockery of her tone struck him as the echo of an unforgotten\nair. He looked at her a moment, and then he said--\n\n“You are not changed; I find you quite the same.”\n\n“I am sorry for that!” And she turned away.\n\n“What are you doing?” he asked. “Where are you going?”\n\nShe looked about her, without answering, up and down the little terrace.\nThe Casino at Blanquais was a much more modest place of reunion than\nthe Conversation-house at Baden-Baden. It was a small, low structure of\nbrightly painted wood, containing but three or four rooms, and furnished\nall along its front with a narrow covered gallery, which offered a\ndelusive shelter from the rougher moods of the fine, fresh weather.\nIt was somewhat rude and shabby--the subscription for the season was\nlow--but it had a simple picturesqueness. Its little terrace was a very\nconvenient place for a stroll, and the great view of the ocean and of\nthe marble-white crags that formed the broad gate-way of the shallow\nbay, was a sufficient compensation for the absence of luxuries. There\nwere a few people sitting in the gallery, and a few others scattered\nupon the terrace; but the pleasure-seekers of Blanquais were, for the\nmost part, immersed in the salt water or disseminated on the grassy\ndowns.\n\n“I am looking for my mother,” said Angela Vivian.\n\n“I hope your mother is well.”\n\n“Very well, thank you.”\n\n“May I help you to look for her?” Bernard asked.\n\nHer eyes paused in their quest, and rested a moment upon her companion.\n\n“She is not here,” she said presently. “She has gone home.”\n\n“What do you call home?” Bernard demanded.\n\n“The sort of place that we always call home; a bad little house that we\nhave taken for a month.”\n\n“Will you let me come and see it?”\n\n“It ‘s nothing to see.”\n\nBernard hesitated a moment.\n\n“Is that a refusal?”\n\n“I should never think of giving it so fine a name.”\n\n“There would be nothing fine in forbidding me your door. Don’t think\nthat!” said Bernard, with rather a forced laugh.\n\nIt was difficult to know what the girl thought; but she said, in a\nmoment--\n\n“We shall be very happy to see you. I am going home.”\n\n“May I walk with you so far?” asked Bernard.\n\n“It is not far; it ‘s only three minutes.” And Angela moved slowly to\nthe gate of the Casino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nBernard walked beside her, and for some moments nothing was said between\nthem. As the silence continued, he became aware of it, and it vexed\nhim that she should leave certain things unsaid. She had asked him no\nquestion--neither whence he had come, nor how long he would stay, nor\nwhat had happened to him since they parted. He wished to see whether\nthis was intention or accident. He was already complaining to himself\nthat she expressed no interest in him, and he was perfectly aware that\nthis was a ridiculous feeling. He had come to speak to her in order to\ntell her that he was going away, and yet, at the end of five minutes,\nhe had asked leave to come and see her. This sudden gyration of mind\nwas grotesque, and Bernard knew it; but, nevertheless, he had an immense\nexpectation that, if he should give her time, she would manifest some\ncuriosity as to his own situation. He tried to give her time; he held\nhis tongue; but she continued to say nothing. They passed along a sort\nof winding lane, where two or three fishermen’s cottages, with old brown\nnets suspended on the walls and drying in the sun, stood open to the\nroad, on the other side of which was a patch of salt-looking grass,\nbrowsed by a donkey that was not fastidious.\n\n“It ‘s so long since we parted, and we have so much to say to each\nother!” Bernard exclaimed at last, and he accompanied this declaration\nwith a laugh much more spontaneous than the one he had given a few\nmoments before.\n\nIt might have gratified him, however, to observe that his companion\nappeared to see no ground for joking in the idea that they should have a\ngood deal to say to each other.\n\n“Yes, it ‘s a long time since we spent those pleasant weeks at Baden,”\n she rejoined. “Have you been there again?”\n\nThis was a question, and though it was a very simple one, Bernard was\ncharmed with it.\n\n“I would n’t go back for the world!” he said. “And you?”\n\n“Would I go back? Oh yes; I thought it so agreeable.”\n\nWith this he was less pleased; he had expected the traces of resentment,\nand he was actually disappointed at not finding them. But here was the\nlittle house of which his companion had spoken, and it seemed, indeed, a\nrather bad one. That is, it was one of those diminutive structures which\nare known at French watering-places as “chalets,” and, with an exiguity\nof furniture, are let for the season to families that pride themselves\nupon their powers of contraction. This one was a very humble specimen of\nits class, though it was doubtless a not inadequate abode for two quiet\nand frugal women. It had a few inches of garden, and there were flowers\nin pots in the open windows, where some extremely fresh white curtains\nwere gently fluttering in the breath of the neighboring ocean. The\nlittle door stood wide open.\n\n“This is where we live,” said Angela; and she stopped and laid her hand\nupon the little garden-gate.\n\n“It ‘s very fair,” said Bernard. “I think it ‘s better than the\npastry-cook’s at Baden.”\n\nThey stood there, and she looked over the gate at the geraniums. She did\nnot ask him to come in; but, on the other hand, keeping the gate closed,\nshe made no movement to leave him. The Casino was now quite out of\nsight, and the whole place was perfectly still. Suddenly, turning her\neyes upon Bernard with a certain strange inconsequence--\n\n“I have not seen you here before,” she observed.\n\nHe gave a little laugh.\n\n“I suppose it ‘s because I only arrived this morning. I think that if I\nhad been here you would have noticed me.”\n\n“You arrived this morning?”\n\n“Three or four hours ago. So, if the remark were not in questionable\ntaste, I should say we had not lost time.”\n\n“You may say what you please,” said Angela, simply. “Where did you come\nfrom?”\n\nInterrogation, now it had come, was most satisfactory, and Bernard\nwas glad to believe that there was an element of the unexpected in his\nanswer.\n\n“From California.”\n\n“You came straight from California to this place?”\n\n“I arrived at Havre only yesterday.”\n\n“And why did you come here?”\n\n“It would be graceful of me to be able to answer--‘Because I knew you\nwere here.’ But unfortunately I did not know it. It was a mere chance;\nor rather, I feel like saying it was an inspiration.”\n\nAngela looked at the geraniums again.\n\n“It was very singular,” she said. “We might have been in so many places\nbesides this one. And you might have come to so many places besides this\none.”\n\n“It is all the more singular, that one of the last persons I saw in\nAmerica was your charming friend Blanche, who married Gordon Wright. She\ndid n’t tell me you were here.”\n\n“She had no reason to know it,” said the girl. “She is not my friend--as\nyou are her husband’s friend.”\n\n“Ah no, I don’t suppose that. But she might have heard from you.”\n\n“She does n’t hear from us. My mother used to write to her for a while\nafter she left Europe, but she has given it up.” She paused a moment,\nand then she added--“Blanche is too silly!”\n\nBernard noted this, wondering how it bore upon his theory of a spiteful\nelement in his companion. Of course Blanche was silly; but, equally of\ncourse, this young lady’s perception of it was quickened by Blanche’s\nhaving married a rich man whom she herself might have married.\n\n“Gordon does n’t think so,” Bernard said.\n\nAngela looked at him a moment.\n\n“I am very glad to hear it,” she rejoined, gently.\n\n“Yes, it is very fortunate.”\n\n“Is he well?” the girl asked. “Is he happy?”\n\n“He has all the air of it.”\n\n“I am very glad to hear it,” she repeated. And then she moved the latch\nof the gate and passed in. At the same moment her mother appeared in the\nopen door-way. Mrs. Vivian had apparently been summoned by the sound\nof her daughter’s colloquy with an unrecognized voice, and when she saw\nBernard she gave a sharp little cry of surprise. Then she stood gazing\nat him.\n\nSince the dispersion of the little party at Baden-Baden he had not\ndevoted much meditation to this conscientious gentlewoman who had been\nso tenderly anxious to establish her daughter properly in life; but\nthere had been in his mind a tacit assumption that if Angela deemed that\nhe had played her a trick Mrs. Vivian’s view of his conduct was not more\ncharitable. He felt that he must have seemed to her very unkind, and\nthat in so far as a well-regulated conscience permitted the exercise of\nunpractical passions, she honored him with a superior detestation.\nThe instant he beheld her on her threshold this conviction rose to the\nsurface of his consciousness and made him feel that now, at least, his\nhour had come.\n\n“It is Mr. Longueville, whom we met at Baden,” said Angela to her\nmother, gravely.\n\nMrs. Vivian began to smile, and stepped down quickly toward the gate.\n\n“Ah, Mr. Longueville,” she murmured, “it ‘s so long--it ‘s so\npleasant--it ‘s so strange--”\n\nAnd suddenly she stopped, still smiling. Her smile had an odd intensity;\nshe was trembling a little, and Bernard, who was prepared for hissing\nscorn, perceived with a deep, an almost violent, surprise, a touching\nagitation, an eager friendliness.\n\n“Yes, it ‘s very long,” he said; “it ‘s very pleasant. I have only just\narrived; I met Miss Vivian.”\n\n“And you are not coming in?” asked Angela’s mother, very graciously.\n\n“Your daughter has not asked me!” said Bernard.\n\n“Ah, my dearest,” murmured Mrs. Vivian, looking at the girl.\n\nHer daughter returned her glance, and then the elder lady paused again,\nand simply began to smile at Bernard, who recognized in her glance that\nqueer little intimation--shy and cautious, yet perfectly discernible--of\na desire to have a private understanding with what he felt that she\nmentally termed his better nature, which he had more than once perceived\nat Baden-Baden.\n\n“Ah no, she has not asked me,” Bernard repeated, laughing gently.\n\nThen Angela turned her eyes upon him, and the expression of those fine\norgans was strikingly agreeable. It had, moreover, the merit of being\neasily interpreted; it said very plainly, “Please don’t insist, but\nleave me alone.” And it said it not at all sharply--very gently and\npleadingly. Bernard found himself understanding it so well that he\nliterally blushed with intelligence.\n\n“Don’t you come to the Casino in the evening, as you used to come to the\nKursaal?” he asked.\n\nMrs. Vivian looked again at her daughter, who had passed into the\ndoor-way of the cottage; then she said--\n\n“We will go this evening.”\n\n“I shall look for you eagerly,” Bernard rejoined. “Auf wiedersehen, as\nwe used to say at Baden!”\n\nMrs. Vivian waved him a response over the gate, her daughter gave him a\nglance from the threshold, and he took his way back to his inn.\n\nHe awaited the evening with great impatience; he fancied he had made a\ndiscovery, and he wished to confirm it. The discovery was that his idea\nthat she bore him a grudge, that she was conscious of an injury, that he\nwas associated in her mind with a wrong, had all been a morbid illusion.\nShe had forgiven, she had forgotten, she did n’t care, she had possibly\nnever cared! This, at least, was his theory now, and he longed for a\nlittle more light upon it. His old sense of her being a complex and\nintricate girl had, in that quarter of an hour of talk with her, again\nbecome lively, so that he was not absolutely sure his apprehensions\nhad been vain. But, with his quick vision of things, he had got the\nimpression, at any rate, that she had no vulgar resentment of any slight\nhe might have put upon her, or any disadvantage he might have caused\nher. Her feeling about such a matter would be large and original.\nBernard desired to see more of that, and in the evening, in fact, it\nseemed to him that he did so.\n\nThe terrace of the Casino was far from offering the brilliant spectacle\nof the promenade in front of the gaming-rooms at Baden. It had neither\nthe liberal illumination, the distinguished frequenters, nor the\nsuperior music which formed the attraction of that celebrated spot; but\nit had a modest animation of its own, in which the starlight on the open\nsea took the place of clustered lamps, and the mighty resonance of\nthe waves performed the function of an orchestra. Mrs. Vivian made her\nappearance with her daughter, and Bernard, as he used to do at Baden,\nchose a corner to place some chairs for them. The crowd was small, for\nmost of the visitors had compressed themselves into one of the rooms,\nwhere a shrill operetta was being performed by a strolling troupe. Mrs.\nVivian’s visit was a short one; she remained at the Casino less than\nhalf an hour. But Bernard had some talk with Angela. He sat beside\nher--her mother was on the other side, talking with an old French lady\nwhose acquaintance she had made on the beach. Between Bernard and Angela\nseveral things were said. When his friends went away Bernard walked home\nwith them. He bade them good-night at the door of their chalet, and then\nslowly strolled back to the Casino. The terrace was nearly empty; every\none had gone to listen to the operetta, the sound of whose contemporary\ngayety came through the open, hot-looking windows in little thin quavers\nand catches. The ocean was rumbling just beneath; it made a ruder but\nricher music. Bernard stood looking at it a moment; then he went down\nthe steps to the beach. The tide was rather low; he walked slowly down\nto the line of the breaking waves. The sea looked huge and black and\nsimple; everything was vague in the unassisted darkness. Bernard stood\nthere some time; there was nothing but the sound and the sharp, fresh\nsmell. Suddenly he put his hand to his heart; it was beating very fast.\nAn immense conviction had come over him--abruptly, then and there--and\nfor a moment he held his breath. It was like a word spoken in the\ndarkness--he held his breath to listen. He was in love with Angela\nVivian, and his love was a throbbing passion! He sat down on the stones\nwhere he stood--it filled him with a kind of awe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nIt filled him with a kind of awe, and the feeling was by no means\nagreeable. It was not a feeling to which even a man of Bernard\nLongueville’s easy power of extracting the savour from a sensation could\nrapidly habituate himself, and for the rest of that night it was far\nfrom making of our hero the happy man that a lover just coming\nto self-consciousness is supposed to be. It was wrong--it was\ndishonorable--it was impossible--and yet it was; it was, as nothing in\nhis own personal experience had ever been. He seemed hitherto to have\nbeen living by proxy, in a vision, in reflection--to have been an echo,\na shadow, a futile attempt; but this at last was life itself, this was\na fact, this was reality. For these things one lived; these were\nthe things that people had died for. Love had been a fable before\nthis--doubtless a very pretty one; and passion had been a literary\nphrase--employed obviously with considerable effect. But now he stood in\na personal relation to these familiar ideas, which gave them a very much\nkeener import; they had laid their hand upon him in the darkness, he\nfelt it upon his shoulder, and he knew by its pressure that it was the\nhand of destiny. What made this sensation a shock was the element that\nwas mixed with it; the fact that it came not simply and singly, but with\nan attendant shadow in which it immediately merged and lost itself. It\nwas forbidden fruit--he knew it the instant he had touched it. He felt\nthat he had pledged himself not to do just this thing which was gleaming\nbefore him so divinely--not to widen the crevice, not to open the door\nthat would flood him with light. Friendship and honor were at stake;\nthey stood at his left hand, as his new-born passion stood already at\nhis right; they claimed him as well, and their grasp had a pressure\nwhich might become acutely painful. The soul is a still more tender\norganism than the body, and it shrinks from the prospect of being\nsubjected to violence. Violence--spiritual violence--was what our\nluxurious hero feared; and it is not too much to say that as he lingered\nthere by the sea, late into the night, while the gurgitation of the\nwaves grew deeper to his ear, the prospect came to have an element of\npositive terror. The two faces of his situation stood confronting each\nother; it was a rigid, brutal opposition, and Bernard held his breath\nfor a while with the wonder of what would come of it. He sat a long time\nupon the beach; the night grew very cold, but he had no sense of it.\nThen he went away and passed before the Casino again, and wandered\nthrough the village. The Casino was shrouded in darkness and silence,\nand there was nothing in the streets of the little town but the salt\nsmell of the sea, a vague aroma of fish and the distant sound of the\nbreakers. Little by little, Bernard lost the feeling of having been\nstartled, and began to perceive that he could reason about his trouble.\nTrouble it was, though this seems an odd name for the consciousness of\na bright enchantment; and the first thing that reason, definitely\nconsulted, told him about the matter was that he had been in love with\nAngela Vivian any time these three years. This sapient faculty supplied\nhim with further information; only two or three of the items of which,\nhowever, it is necessary to reproduce. He had been a great fool--an\nincredible fool--not to have discovered before this what was the matter\nwith him! Bernard’s sense of his own shrewdness--always tolerably\nacute--had never received such a bruise as this present perception that\na great many things had been taking place in his clever mind without his\nclever mind suspecting them. But it little mattered, his reason went on\nto declare, what he had suspected or what he might now feel about it;\nhis present business was to leave Blanquais-les-Galets at sunrise the\nnext morning and never rest his eyes upon Angela Vivian again. This was\nhis duty; it had the merit of being perfectly plain and definite, easily\napprehended, and unattended, as far as he could discover, with the\nsmallest material difficulties. Not only this, reason continued to\nremark; but the moral difficulties were equally inconsiderable. He had\nnever breathed a word of his passion to Miss Vivian--quite the contrary;\nhe had never committed himself nor given her the smallest reason to\nsuspect his hidden flame; and he was therefore perfectly free to turn\nhis back upon her--he could never incur the reproach of trifling\nwith her affections. Bernard was in that state of mind when it is the\ngreatest of blessings to be saved the distress of choice--to see a\nstraight path before you and to feel that you have only to follow it.\nUpon the straight path I have indicated, he fixed his eyes very hard; of\ncourse he would take his departure at the earliest possible hour on the\nmorrow. There was a streak of morning in the eastern sky by the time he\nknocked for re-admittance at the door of the inn, which was opened to\nhim by a mysterious old woman in a nightcap and meagre accessories,\nwhose identity he failed to ascertain; and he laid himself down to\nrest--he was very tired--with his attention fastened, as I say, on the\nidea--on the very image--of departure.\n\nOn waking up the next morning, rather late, he found, however, that it\nhad attached itself to a very different object. His vision was filled\nwith the brightness of the delightful fact itself, which seemed to\nimpregnate the sweet morning air and to flutter in the light, fresh\nbreeze that came through his open window from the sea. He saw a great\npatch of the sea between a couple of red-tiled roofs; it was bluer than\nany sea had ever been before. He had not slept long--only three or four\nhours; but he had quite slept off his dread. The shadow had dropped away\nand nothing was left but the beauty of his love, which seemed to shine\nin the freshness of the early day. He felt absurdly happy--as if he had\ndiscovered El Dorado; quite apart from consequences--he was not thinking\nof consequences, which of course were another affair--the feeling was\nintrinsically the finest one he had ever had, and--as a mere feeling--he\nhad not done with it yet. The consideration of consequences could easily\nbe deferred, and there would, meanwhile, be no injury to any one in his\nextracting, very quietly, a little subjective joy from the state of his\nheart. He would let the flower bloom for a day before plucking it up\nby the roots. Upon this latter course he was perfectly resolved, and in\nview of such an heroic resolution the subjective interlude appeared\nno more than his just privilege. The project of leaving\nBlanquais-les-Galets at nine o’clock in the morning dropped lightly from\nhis mind, making no noise as it fell; but another took its place, which\nhad an air of being still more excellent and which consisted of starting\noff on a long walk and absenting himself for the day. Bernard grasped\nhis stick and wandered away; he climbed the great shoulder of the\nfurther cliff and found himself on the level downs. Here there was\napparently no obstacle whatever to his walking as far as his fancy\nshould carry him. The summer was still in a splendid mood, and the hot\nand quiet day--it was a Sunday--seemed to constitute a deep, silent\nsmile on the face of nature. The sea glistened on one side, and the\ncrops ripened on the other; the larks, losing themselves in the dense\nsunshine, made it ring here and there in undiscoverable spots; this\nwas the only sound save when Bernard, pausing now and then in his walk,\nfound himself hearing far below him, at the base of the cliff, the\ndrawling murmur of a wave. He walked a great many miles and passed\nthrough half a dozen of those rude fishing-hamlets, lodged in some\nsloping hollow of the cliffs, so many of which, of late years, all along\nthe Norman coast, have adorned themselves with a couple of hotels and a\nrow of bathing-machines. He walked so far that the shadows had begun to\nlengthen before he bethought himself of stopping; the afternoon had\ncome on and had already begun to wane. The grassy downs still stretched\nbefore him, shaded here and there with shallow but windless dells. He\nlooked for the softest place and then flung himself down on the grass;\nhe lay there for a long time, thinking of many things. He had determined\nto give himself up to a day’s happiness; it was happiness of a\nvery harmless kind--the satisfaction of thought, the bliss of mere\nconsciousness; but such as it was it did not elude him nor turn bitter\nin his heart, and the long summer day closed upon him before his spirit,\nhovering in perpetual circles round the idea of what might be, had begun\nto rest its wing. When he rose to his feet again it was too late to\nreturn to Blanquais in the same way that he had come; the evening was\nat hand, the light was already fading, and the walk he had taken was\none which even if he had not felt very tired, he would have thought it\nimprudent to attempt to repeat in the darkness. He made his way to the\nnearest village, where he was able to hire a rustic carriole, in which\nprimitive conveyance, gaining the high-road, he jogged and jostled\nthrough the hours of the evening slowly back to his starting-point. It\nwanted an hour of midnight by the time he reached his inn, and there was\nnothing left for him but to go to bed.\n\nHe went in the unshaken faith that he should leave Blanquais early on\nthe morrow. But early on the morrow it occurred to him that it would be\nsimply grotesque to go off without taking leave of Mrs. Vivian and her\ndaughter, and offering them some explanation of his intention. He had\ngiven them to understand that, so delighted was he to find them there,\nhe would remain at Blanquais at least as long as they. He must have\nseemed to them wanting in civility, to spend a whole bright Sunday\nwithout apparently troubling his head about them, and if the unlucky\nfact of his being in love with the girl were a reason for doing his\nduty, it was at least not a reason for being rude. He had not yet come\nto that--to accepting rudeness as an incident of virtue; it had always\nbeen his theory that virtue had the best manners in the world, and he\nflattered himself at any rate that he could guard his integrity without\nmaking himself ridiculous. So, at what he thought a proper hour, in\nthe course of the morning, he retraced his steps along the little lane\nthrough which, two days ago, Angela Vivian had shown him the way to\nher mother’s door. At this humble portal he knocked; the windows of the\nlittle chalet were open, and the white curtains, behind the flower-pots,\nwere fluttering as he had seen them before. The door was opened by\na neat young woman, who informed him very promptly that Madame and\nMademoiselle had left Blanquais a couple of hours earlier. They had gone\nto Paris--yes, very suddenly, taking with them but little luggage, and\nthey had left her--she had the honor of being the femme de chambre of\nces dames--to put up their remaining possessions and follow as soon\nas possible. On Bernard’s expressing surprise and saying that he had\nsupposed them to be fixed at the sea-side for the rest of the season,\nthe femme de chambre, who seemed a very intelligent person, begged to\nremind him that the season was drawing to a close, that Madame had taken\nthe chalet but for five weeks, only ten days of which period were yet to\nexpire, that ces dames, as Monsieur perhaps knew, were great travellers,\nwho had been half over the world and thought nothing of breaking camp\nat an hour’s notice, and that, in fine, Madame might very well have\nreceived a telegram summoning her to another part of the country.\n\n“And where have the ladies gone?” asked Bernard.\n\n“For the moment, to Paris.”\n\n“And in Paris where have they gone?”\n\n“Dame, chez elles--to their house,” said the femme de chambre, who\nappeared to think that Bernard asked too many questions.\n\nBut Bernard persisted.\n\n“Where is their house?”\n\nThe waiting-maid looked at him from head to foot.\n\n“If Monsieur wishes to write, many of Madame’s letters come to her\nbanker,” she said, inscrutably.\n\n“And who is her banker?”\n\n“He lives in the Rue de Provence.”\n\n“Very good--I will find him out,” said our hero, turning away.\n\nThe discriminating reader who has been so good as to interest himself\nin this little narrative will perhaps at this point exclaim with a\npardonable consciousness of shrewdness: “Of course he went the next day\nto the Rue de Provence!” Of course, yes; only as it happens Bernard did\nnothing of the kind. He did one of the most singular things he ever did\nin his life--a thing that puzzled him even at the time, and with regard\nto which he often afterward wondered whence he had drawn the ability\nfor so remarkable a feat--he simply spent a fortnight at\nBlanquais-les-Galets. It was a very quiet fortnight; he spoke to no one,\nhe formed no relations, he was company to himself. It may be added that\nhe had never found his own company half so good. He struck himself as\na reasonable, delicate fellow, who looked at things in such a way as\nto make him refrain--refrain successfully, that was the point--from\nconcerning himself practically about Angela Vivian. His saying that\nhe would find out the banker in the Rue de Provence had been for the\nbenefit of the femme de chambre, whom he thought rather impertinent; he\nhad really no intention whatever of entering that classic thoroughfare.\nHe took long walks, rambled on the beach, along the base of the cliffs\nand among the brown sea-caves, and he thought a good deal of certain\nincidents which have figured at an earlier stage of this narrative. He\nhad forbidden himself the future, as an object of contemplation, and\nit was therefore a matter of necessity that his imagination should take\nrefuge among the warm and familiar episodes of the past. He wondered why\nMrs. Vivian should have left the place so suddenly, and was of course\nstruck with the analogy between this incident and her abrupt departure\nfrom Baden. It annoyed him, it troubled him, but it by no means\nrekindled the alarm he had felt on first perceiving the injured Angela\non the beach. That alarm had been quenched by Angela’s manner during\nthe hour that followed and during their short talk in the evening. This\nevening was to be forever memorable, for it had brought with it the\nrevelation which still, at moments, suddenly made Bernard tremble; but\nit had also brought him the assurance that Angela cared as little as\npossible for anything that a chance acquaintance might have said about\nher. It is all the more singular, therefore, that one evening, after he\nhad been at Blanquais a fortnight, a train of thought should suddenly\nhave been set in motion in his mind. It was kindled by no outward\noccurrence, but by some wandering spark of fancy or of memory, and the\nimmediate effect of it was to startle our hero very much as he had been\nstartled on the evening I have described. The circumstances were the\nsame; he had wandered down to the beach alone, very late, and he stood\nlooking at the duskily-tumbling sea. Suddenly the same voice that had\nspoken before murmured another phrase in the darkness, and it rang upon\nhis ear for the rest of the night. It startled him, as I have said,\nat first; then, the next morning, it led him to take his departure for\nParis. During the journey it lingered in his ear; he sat in the corner\nof the railway-carriage with his eyes closed, abstracted, on purpose to\nprolong the reverberation. If it were not true it was at least, as the\nItalians have it, ben trovato, and it was wonderful how well it bore\nthinking of. It bears telling less well; but I can at least give a hint\nof it. The theory that Angela hated him had evaporated in her presence,\nand another of a very different sort had sprung into being. It fitted\na great many of the facts, it explained a great many contradictions,\nanomalies, mysteries, and it accounted for Miss Vivian’s insisting upon\nher mother’s leaving Blanquais at a few hours’ notice, even better\nthan the theory of her resentment could have done. At any rate, it\nobliterated Bernard’s scruples very effectually, and led him on his\narrival in Paris to repair instantly to the Rue de Provence. This street\ncontains more than one banker, but there is one with whom Bernard deemed\nMrs. Vivian most likely to have dealings. He found he had reckoned\nrightly, and he had no difficulty in procuring her address. Having done\nso, however, he by no means went immediately to see her; he waited a\ncouple of days--perhaps to give those obliterated scruples I have spoken\nof a chance to revive. They kept very quiet, and it must be confessed\nthat Bernard took no great pains to recall them to life. After he had\nbeen in Paris three days, he knocked at Mrs. Vivian’s door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nIt was opened by the little waiting-maid whom he had seen at Blanquais,\nand who looked at him very hard before she answered his inquiry.\n\n“You see I have found Mrs. Vivian’s dwelling, though you would n’t give\nme the address,” Bernard said to her, smiling.\n\n“Monsieur has put some time to it!” the young woman answered dryly. And\nshe informed him that Madame was at home, though Mademoiselle, for whom\nhe had not asked, was not.\n\nMrs. Vivian occupied a diminutive apartment at the summit of one of\nthe tall white houses which ornament the neighborhood of the Arc de\nTriomphe. The early days of September had arrived, but Paris was still\na city of absentees. The weather was warm and charming, and a certain\nsavour of early autumn in the air was in accord with the somewhat\nmelancholy aspect of the empty streets and closed shutters of this\nhonorable quarter, where the end of the monumental vistas seemed to\nbe curtained with a hazy emanation from the Seine. It was late in\nthe afternoon when Bernard was ushered into Mrs. Vivian’s little\nhigh-nestling drawing-room, and a patch of sunset tints, faintly red,\nrested softly upon the gilded wall. Bernard had seen these ladies only\nin borrowed and provisional abodes; but here was a place where they were\nreally living and which was stamped with their tastes, their habits,\ntheir charm. The little salon was very elegant; it contained a\nmultitude of pretty things, and it appeared to Bernard to be arranged\nin perfection. The long windows--the ceiling being low, they were really\nvery short--opened upon one of those solid balconies, occupying the\nwidth of the apartment, which are often in Paris a compensation for\nliving up five flights of stairs, and this balcony was filled with\nflowers and cushions. Bernard stepped out upon it to await the coming\nof Mrs. Vivian, and, as she was not quick to appear, he had time to\nsee that his friends enjoyed a magnificent view. They looked up at the\ntriumphal Arch, which presented itself at a picturesque angle, and near\nthe green tree-tops of the Champs Elysees, beyond which they caught a\nbroad gleam of the Seine and a glimpse, blue in the distance, of the\ngreat towers of Notre Dame. The whole vast city lay before them and\nbeneath them, with its ordered brilliancy and its mingled aspect of\ncompression and expansion; and yet the huge Parisian murmur died away\nbefore it reached Mrs. Vivian’s sky-parlor, which seemed to Bernard the\nbrightest and quietest little habitation he had ever known.\n\nHis hostess came rustling in at last; she seemed agitated; she knocked\nover with the skirt of her dress a little gilded chair which was\nreflected in the polished parquet as in a sheet of looking-glass. Mrs.\nVivian had a fixed smile--she hardly knew what to say.\n\n“I found your address at the banker’s,” said Bernard. “Your maid, at\nBlanquais, refused to give it to me.”\n\nMrs. Vivian gave him a little look--there was always more or less of\nit in her face--which seemed equivalent to an entreaty that her\ninterlocutor should spare her.\n\n“Maids are so strange,” she murmured; “especially the French!”\n\nIt pleased Bernard for the moment not to spare her, though he felt a\nsort of delight of kindness for her.\n\n“Your going off from Blanquais so suddenly, without leaving me any\nexplanation, any clue, any message of any sort--made me feel at first as\nif you did n’t wish that I should look you up. It reminded me of the way\nyou left Baden--do you remember?--three years ago.”\n\n“Baden was so charming--but one could n’t stay forever,” said Mrs.\nVivian.\n\n“I had a sort of theory one could. Our life was so pleasant that it\nseemed a shame to break the spell, and if no one had moved I am sure we\nmight be sitting there now.”\n\nMrs. Vivian stared, still with her little fixed smile.\n\n“I think we should have had bad weather.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Bernard, laughing. “Nature would have grown jealous\nof our good-humor--of our tranquil happiness. And after all, here we are\ntogether again--that is, some of us. But I have only my own audacity\nto thank for it. I was quite free to believe that you were not at all\npleased to see me re-appear--and it is only because I am not easy to\ndiscourage--am indeed probably a rather impudent fellow--that I have\nventured to come here to-day.”\n\n“I am very glad to see you re-appear, Mr. Longueville,” Mrs. Vivian\ndeclared with the accent of veracity.\n\n“It was your daughter’s idea, then, running away from Blanquais?”\n\nMrs. Vivian lowered her eyes.\n\n“We were obliged to go to Fontainebleau. We have but just come back. I\nthought of writing to you,” she softly added.\n\n“Ah, what pleasure that would have given me!”\n\n“I mean, to tell you where we were, and that we should have been so\nhappy to see you.”\n\n“I thank you for the intention. I suppose your daughter would n’t let\nyou carry it out.”\n\n“Angela is so peculiar,” Mrs. Vivian said, simply.\n\n“You told me that the first time I saw you.”\n\n“Yes, at Siena,” said Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“I am glad to hear you speak frankly of that place!”\n\n“Perhaps it ‘s better,” Mrs. Vivian murmured. She got up and went to the\nwindow; then stepping upon the balcony, she looked down a moment into\nthe street. “She will come back in a moment,” she said, coming into the\nroom again. “She has gone to see a friend who lives just beside us. We\ndon’t mind about Siena now,” she added, softly.\n\nBernard understood her--understood this to be a retraction of the\nrequest she had made of him at Baden.\n\n“Dear little woman,” he said to himself, “she wants to marry her\ndaughter still--only now she wants to marry her to me!”\n\nHe wished to show her that he understood her, and he was on the point of\nseizing her hand, to do he did n’t know what--to hold it, to press it,\nto kiss it--when he heard the sharp twang of the bell at the door of the\nlittle apartment.\n\nMrs. Vivian fluttered away.\n\n“It ‘s Angela,” she cried, and she stood there waiting and listening,\nsmiling at Bernard, with her handkerchief pressed to her lips.\n\nIn a moment the girl came into the drawing-room, but on seeing Bernard\nshe stopped, with her hand on the door-knob. Her mother went to her and\nkissed her.\n\n“It ‘s Mr. Longueville, dearest--he has found us out.”\n\n“Found us out?” repeated Angela, with a little laugh. “What a singular\nexpression!”\n\nShe was blushing as she had blushed when she first saw him at\nBlanquais. She seemed to Bernard now to have a great and peculiar\nbrightness--something she had never had before.\n\n“I certainly have been looking for you,” he said. “I was greatly\ndisappointed when I found you had taken flight from Blanquais.”\n\n“Taken flight?” She repeated his words as she had repeated her mother’s.\n“That is also a strange way of speaking!”\n\n“I don’t care what I say,” said Bernard, “so long as I make you\nunderstand that I have wanted very much to see you again, and that I\nhave wondered every day whether I might venture--”\n\n“I don’t know why you should n’t venture!” she interrupted, giving her\nlittle laugh again. “We are not so terrible, are we, mamma?--that is,\nwhen once you have climbed our five flights of stairs.”\n\n“I came up very fast,” said Bernard, “and I find your apartment\nmagnificent.”\n\n“Mr. Longueville must come again, must he not, dear?” asked mamma.\n\n“I shall come very often, with your leave,” Bernard declared.\n\n“It will be immensely kind,” said Angela, looking away.\n\n“I am not sure that you will think it that.”\n\n“I don’t know what you are trying to prove,” said Angela; “first that we\nran away from you, and then that we are not nice to our visitors.”\n\n“Oh no, not that!” Bernard exclaimed; “for I assure you I shall not care\nhow cold you are with me.”\n\nShe walked away toward another door, which was masked with a curtain\nthat she lifted.\n\n“I am glad to hear that, for it gives me courage to say that I am very\ntired, and that I beg you will excuse me.”\n\nShe glanced at him a moment over her shoulder; then she passed out,\ndropping the curtain.\n\nBernard stood there face to face with Mrs. Vivian, whose eyes seemed to\nplead with him more than ever. In his own there was an excited smile.\n\n“Please don’t mind that,” she murmured. “I know it ‘s true that she is\ntired.”\n\n“Mind it, dear lady?” cried the young man. “I delight in it. It ‘s just\nwhat I like.”\n\n“Ah, she ‘s very peculiar!” sighed Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“She is strange--yes. But I think I understand her a little.”\n\n“You must come back to-morrow, then.”\n\n“I hope to have many to-morrows!” cried Bernard as he took his\ndeparture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAnd he had them in fact. He called the next day at the same hour, and he\nfound the mother and the daughter together in their pretty salon. Angela\nwas very gentle and gracious; he suspected Mrs. Vivian had given her a\ntender little lecture upon the manner in which she had received him the\nday before. After he had been there five minutes, Mrs. Vivian took a\ndecanter of water that was standing upon a table and went out on the\nbalcony to irrigate her flowers. Bernard watched her a while from his\nplace in the room; then she moved along the balcony and out of sight.\nSome ten minutes elapsed without her re-appearing, and then Bernard\nstepped to the threshold of the window and looked for her. She was not\nthere, and as he came and took his seat near Angela again, he announced,\nrather formally, that Mrs. Vivian had passed back into one of the other\nwindows.\n\nAngela was silent a moment--then she said--\n\n“Should you like me to call her?”\n\nShe was very peculiar--that was very true; yet Bernard held to his\ndeclaration of the day before that he now understood her a little.\n\n“No, I don’t desire it,” he said. “I wish to see you alone; I have\nsomething particular to say to you.”\n\nShe turned her face toward him, and there was something in its\nexpression that showed him that he looked to her more serious than he\nhad ever looked. He sat down again; for some moments he hesitated to go\non.\n\n“You frighten me,” she said laughing; and in spite of her laugh this was\nobviously true.\n\n“I assure you my state of mind is anything but formidable. I am afraid\nof you, on the contrary; I am humble and apologetic.”\n\n“I am sorry for that,” said Angela. “I particularly dislike receiving\napologies, even when I know what they are for. What yours are for, I\ncan’t imagine.”\n\n“You don’t dislike me--you don’t hate me?” Bernard suddenly broke out.\n\n“You don’t ask me that humbly. Excuse me therefore if I say I have\nother, and more practical, things to do.”\n\n“You despise me,” said Bernard.\n\n“That is not humble either, for you seem to insist upon it.”\n\n“It would be after all a way of thinking of me, and I have a reason for\nwishing you to do that.”\n\n“I remember very well that you used to have a reason for everything. It\nwas not always a good one.”\n\n“This one is excellent,” said Bernard, gravely. “I have been in love\nwith you for three years.”\n\nShe got up slowly, turning away.\n\n“Is that what you wished to say to me?”\n\nShe went toward the open window, and he followed her.\n\n“I hope it does n’t offend you. I don’t say it lightly--it ‘s not a\npiece of gallantry. It ‘s the very truth of my being. I did n’t know it\ntill lately--strange as that may seem. I loved you long before I knew\nit--before I ventured or presumed to know it. I was thinking of you\nwhen I seemed to myself to be thinking of other things. It is very\nstrange--there are things in it I don’t understand. I travelled over\nthe world, I tried to interest, to divert myself; but at bottom it was\na perfect failure. To see you again--that was what I wanted. When I saw\nyou last month at Blanquais I knew it; then everything became clear. It\nwas the answer to the riddle. I wished to read it very clearly--I wished\nto be sure; therefore I did n’t follow you immediately. I questioned my\nheart--I cross-questioned it. It has borne the examination, and now I am\nsure. I am very sure. I love you as my life--I beg you to listen to me!”\n\nShe had listened--she had listened intently, looking straight out of the\nwindow and without moving.\n\n“You have seen very little of me,” she said, presently, turning her\nilluminated eye on him.\n\n“I have seen enough,” Bernard added, smiling. “You must remember that at\nBaden I saw a good deal of you.”\n\n“Yes, but that did n’t make you like me. I don’t understand.”\n\nBernard stood there a moment, frowning, with his eyes lowered.\n\n“I can imagine that. But I think I can explain.”\n\n“Don’t explain now,” said Angela. “You have said enough; explain some\nother time.” And she went out on the balcony.\n\nBernard, of course, in a moment was beside her, and, disregarding her\ninjunction, he began to explain.\n\n“I thought I disliked you--but I have come to the conclusion it was just\nthe contrary. In reality I was in love with you. I had been so from the\nfirst time I saw you--when I made that sketch of you at Siena.”\n\n“That in itself needs an explanation. I was not at all nice then--I was\nvery rude, very perverse. I was horrid!”\n\n“Ah, you admit it!” cried Bernard, with a sort of quick elation.\n\nShe had been pale, but she suddenly blushed.\n\n“Your own conduct was singular, as I remember it. It was not exactly\nagreeable.”\n\n“Perhaps not; but at least it was meant to be. I did n’t know how to\nplease you then, and I am far from supposing that I have learned now.\nBut I entreat you to give me a chance.”\n\nShe was silent a while; her eyes wandered over the great prospect of\nParis.\n\n“Do you know how you can please me now?” she said, at last. “By leaving\nme alone.”\n\nBernard looked at her a moment, then came straight back into the\ndrawing-room and took his hat.\n\n“You see I avail myself of the first chance. But I shall come back\nto-morrow.”\n\n“I am greatly obliged to you for what you have said. Such a speech as\nthat deserves to be listened to with consideration. You may come back\nto-morrow,” Angela added.\n\nOn the morrow, when he came back, she received him alone.\n\n“How did you know, at Baden, that I did n’t like you?” he asked, as soon\nas she would allow him.\n\nShe smiled, very gently.\n\n“You assured me yesterday that you did like me.”\n\n“I mean that I supposed I did n’t. How did you know that?”\n\n“I can only say that I observed.”\n\n“You must have observed very closely, for, superficially, I rather had\nthe air of admiring you,” said Bernard.\n\n“It was very superficial.”\n\n“You don’t mean that; for, after all, that is just what my admiration,\nmy interest in you, were not. They were deep, they were latent. They\nwere not superficial--they were subterranean.”\n\n“You are contradicting yourself, and I am perfectly consistent,”\n said Angela. “Your sentiments were so well hidden that I supposed I\ndispleased you.”\n\n“I remember that at Baden, you used to contradict yourself,” Bernard\nanswered.\n\n“You have a terrible memory!”\n\n“Don’t call it terrible, for it sees everything now in a charming\nlight--in the light of this understanding that we have at last arrived\nat, which seems to shine backward--to shine full on those Baden days.”\n\n“Have we at last arrived at an understanding?” she asked, with a grave\ndirectness which Bernard thought the most beautiful thing he had ever\nseen.\n\n“It only depends upon you,” he declared; and then he broke out again\ninto a protestation of passionate tenderness. “Don’t put me off this\ntime,” he cried. “You have had time to think about it; you have had\ntime to get over the surprise, the shock. I love you, and I offer you\neverything that belongs to me in this world.” As she looked at him with\nher dark, clear eyes, weighing this precious vow and yet not committing\nherself--“Ah, you don’t forgive me!” he murmured.\n\nShe gazed at him with the same solemn brightness.\n\n“What have I to forgive you?”\n\nThis question seemed to him enchanting. He reached forward and took her\nhands, and if Mrs. Vivian had come in she would have seen him kneeling\nat her daughter’s feet.\n\nBut Mrs. Vivian remained in seclusion, and Bernard saw her only the next\ntime he came.\n\n“I am very happy, because I think my daughter is happy,” she said.\n\n“And what do you think of me?”\n\n“I think you are very clever. You must promise me to be very good to\nher.”\n\n“I am clever enough to promise that.”\n\n“I think you are good enough to keep it,” said Mrs. Vivian. She looked\nas happy as she said, and her happiness gave her a communicative,\nconfidential tendency. “It is very strange how things come about--how\nthe wheel turns round,” she went on. “I suppose there is no harm in my\ntelling you that I believe she always cared for you.”\n\n“Why did n’t you tell me before?” said Bernard, with almost filial\nreproachfulness.\n\n“How could I? I don’t go about the world offering my daughter to\npeople--especially to indifferent people.”\n\n“At Baden you did n’t think I was indifferent. You were afraid of my not\nbeing indifferent enough.”\n\nMrs. Vivian colored.\n\n“Ah, at Baden I was a little too anxious!”\n\n“Too anxious I should n’t speak to your daughter!” said Bernard,\nlaughing.\n\n“At Baden,” Mrs. Vivian went on, “I had views. But I have n’t any now--I\nhave given them up.”\n\n“That makes your acceptance of me very flattering!” Bernard exclaimed,\nlaughing still more gaily.\n\n“I have something better,” said Mrs. Vivian, laying her finger-tips on\nhis arm. “I have confidence.”\n\nBernard did his best to encourage this gracious sentiment, and it seemed\nto him that there was something yet to be done to implant it more firmly\nin Angela’s breast.\n\n“I have a confession to make to you,” he said to her one day. “I wish\nyou would listen to it.”\n\n“Is it something very horrible?” Angela asked.\n\n“Something very horrible indeed. I once did you an injury.”\n\n“An injury?” she repeated, in a tone which seemed to reduce the offence\nto contemptible proportions by simple vagueness of mind about it.\n\n“I don’t know what to call it,” said Bernard. “A poor service--an\nill-turn.”\n\nAngela gave a shrug, or rather an imitation of a shrug; for she was not\na shrugging person.\n\n“I never knew it.”\n\n“I misrepresented you to Gordon Wright,” Bernard went on.\n\n“Why do you speak to me of him?” she asked rather sadly.\n\n“Does it displease you?”\n\nShe hesitated a little.\n\n“Yes, it displeases me. If your confession has anything to do with him,\nI would rather not hear it.”\n\nBernard returned to the subject another time--he had plenty of\nopportunities. He spent a portion of every day in the company of these\ndear women; and these days were the happiest of his life. The autumn\nweather was warm and soothing, the quartier was still deserted, and the\nuproar of the great city, which seemed a hundred miles away, reached\nthem through the dense October air with a softened and muffled sound.\nThe evenings, however, were growing cool, and before long they lighted\nthe first fire of the season in Mrs. Vivian’s heavily draped little\nchimney-piece. On this occasion Bernard sat there with Angela, watching\nthe bright crackle of the wood and feeling that the charm of winter\nnights had begun. These two young persons were alone together in the\ngathering dusk; it was the hour before dinner, before the lamp had been\nlighted.\n\n“I insist upon making you my confession,” said Bernard. “I shall be very\nunhappy until you let me do it.”\n\n“Unhappy? You are the happiest of men.”\n\n“I lie upon roses, if you will; but this memory, this remorse, is\na folded rose-leaf. I was completely mistaken about you at Baden; I\nthought all manner of evil of you--or at least I said it.”\n\n“Men are dull creatures,” said Angela.\n\n“I think they are. So much so that, as I look back upon that time, there\nare some things I don’t understand even now.”\n\n“I don’t see why you should look back. People in our position are\nsupposed to look forward.”\n\n“You don’t like those Baden days yourself,” said Bernard. “You don’t\nlike to think of them.”\n\n“What a wonderful discovery!”\n\nBernard looked at her a moment in the brightening fire-light.\n\n“What part was it you tried to play there?”\n\nAngela shook her head.\n\n“Men are dull creatures.”\n\n“I have already granted that, and I am eating humble pie in asking for\nan explanation.”\n\n“What did you say of me?” Angela asked, after a silence.\n\n“I said you were a coquette. Remember that I am simply historical.”\n\nShe got up and stood in front of the fire, having her hand on the\nchimney-piece and looking down at the blaze. For some moments she\nremained there. Bernard could not see her face.\n\n“I said you were a dangerous woman to marry,” he went on deliberately.\n“I said it because I thought it. I gave Gordon an opinion about you--it\nwas a very unfavorable one. I could n’t make you out--I thought you were\nplaying a double part. I believed that you were ready to marry him, and\nyet I saw--I thought I saw--” and Bernard paused again.\n\n“What did you see?” and Angela turned toward him.\n\n“That you were encouraging me--playing with me.”\n\n“And you did n’t like that?”\n\n“I liked it immensely--for myself! But did n’t like it for Gordon; and\nI must do myself the justice to say that I thought more of him than of\nmyself.”\n\n“You were an excellent friend,” said Angela, simply.\n\n“I believe I was. And I am so still,” Bernard added.\n\nShe shook her head sadly.\n\n“Poor Mr. Wright!”\n\n“He is a dear good fellow,” said Bernard.\n\n“Thoroughly good, and dear, doubtless to his wife, the affectionate\nBlanche.”\n\n“You don’t like him--you don’t like her,” said Bernard.\n\n“Those are two very different matters. I am very sorry for Mr. Wright.”\n\n“You need n’t be that. He is doing very well.”\n\n“So you have already informed me. But I am sorry for him, all the same.”\n\n“That does n’t answer my question,” Bernard exclaimed, with a certain\nirritation. “What part were you playing?”\n\n“What part do you think?”\n\n“Have n’t I told you I gave it up, long ago?”\n\nAngela stood with her back to the fire, looking at him; her hands were\nlocked behind her.\n\n“Did it ever strike you that my position at Baden was a charming\none?--knowing that I had been handed over to you to be put under the\nmicroscope--like an insect with a pin stuck through it!”\n\n“How in the world did you know it? I thought we were particularly\ncareful.”\n\n“How can a woman help knowing such a thing? She guesses it--she\ndiscovers it by instinct; especially if she be a proud woman.”\n\n“Ah,” said Bernard, “if pride is a source of information, you must be a\nprodigy of knowledge!”\n\n“I don’t know that you are particularly humble!” the girl retorted. “The\nmeekest and most submissive of her sex would not have consented to have\nsuch a bargain as that made about her--such a trick played upon her!”\n\n“My dearest Angela, it was no bargain--no trick!” Bernard interposed.\n\n“It was a clumsy trick--it was a bad bargain!” she declared. “At any\nrate I hated it--I hated the idea of your pretending to pass judgment\nupon me; of your having come to Baden for the purpose. It was as if Mr.\nWright had been buying a horse and you had undertaken to put me through\nmy paces!”\n\n“I undertook nothing--I declined to undertake.”\n\n“You certainly made a study of me--and I was determined you should get\nyour lesson wrong. I determined to embarrass, to mislead, to defeat you.\nOr rather, I did n’t determine; I simply obeyed a natural impulse of\nself-defence--the impulse to evade the fierce light of criticism. I\nwished to put you in the wrong.”\n\n“You did it all very well. You put me admirably in the wrong.”\n\n“The only justification for my doing it at all was my doing it well,”\n said Angela.\n\n“You were justified then! You must have hated me fiercely.”\n\nShe turned her back to him and stood looking at the fire again.\n\n“Yes, there are some things that I did that can be accounted for only by\nan intense aversion.”\n\nShe said this so naturally that in spite of a certain theory that was\ntouched upon a few pages back, Bernard was a good deal bewildered. He\nrose from the sofa where he had been lounging and went and stood beside\nher a moment. Then he passed his arm round her waist and murmured an\nalmost timorous--\n\n“Really?”\n\n“I don’t know what you are trying to make me say!” she answered.\n\nHe looked down at her for a moment as he held her close to him.\n\n“I don’t see, after all, why I should wish to make you say it. It would\nonly make my remorse more acute.”\n\nShe was musing, with her eyes on the fire, and for a moment she made no\nanswer; then, as if her attention were returning--\n\n“Are you still talking about your remorse?” she asked.\n\n“You see I put it very strongly.”\n\n“That I was a horrid creature?”\n\n“That you were not a woman to marry.”\n\n“Ah, my poor Bernard,” said Angela, “I can’t attempt to prove to you\nthat you are not inconsistent!”\n\nThe month of September drew to a close, and she consented to fix a day\nfor their wedding. The last of October was the moment selected, and the\nselection was almost all that was wanting to Bernard’s happiness. I say\n“almost,” for there was a solitary spot in his consciousness which felt\nnumb and dead--unpervaded by the joy with which the rest of his spirit\nseemed to thrill and tingle. The removal of this hard grain in the sweet\nsavour of life was needed to complete his felicity. Bernard felt that he\nhad made the necessary excision when, at the end of the month, he\nwrote to Gordon Wright of his engagement. He had been putting off\nthe performance of this duty from day to day--it seemed so hard to\naccomplish it gracefully. He did it at the end very briefly; it struck\nhim that this was the best way. Three days after he had sent his letter\nthere arrived one from Gordon himself, informing Bernard that he had\nsuddenly determined to bring Blanche to Europe. She was not well, and\nthey would lose no time. They were to sail within a week after his\nwriting. The letter contained a postscript--“Captain Lovelock comes with\nus.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nBernard prepared for Gordon’s arrival in Paris, which, according to his\nletter, would take place in a few days. He was not intending to stop in\nEngland; Blanche desired to proceed immediately to the French capital,\nto confer with her man-milliner, after which it was probable that they\nwould go to Italy or to the East for the winter. “I have given her a\nchoice of Rome or the Nile,” said Gordon, “but she tells me she does n’t\ncare a fig where we go.”\n\nI say that Bernard prepared to receive his friends, and I mean that he\nprepared morally--or even intellectually. Materially speaking, he could\nsimply hold himself in readiness to engage an apartment at a hotel and\nto go to meet them at the station. He expected to hear from Gordon\nas soon as this interesting trio should reach England, but the first\nnotification he received came from a Parisian hotel. It came to him in\nthe shape of a very short note, in the morning, shortly before lunch,\nand was to the effect that his friends had alighted in the Rue de la\nPaix the night before.\n\n“We were tired, and I have slept late,” said Gordon; “otherwise you\nshould have heard from me earlier. Come to lunch, if possible. I want\nextremely to see you.”\n\nBernard, of course, made a point of going to lunch. In as short a time\nas possible he found himself in Gordon’s sitting-room at the Hotel\nMiddlesex. The table was laid for the midday repast, and a gentleman\nstood with his back to the door, looking out of the window. As Bernard\ncame in, this gentleman turned and exhibited the ambrosial beard, the\nsymmetrical shape, the monocular appendage, of Captain Lovelock.\n\nThe Captain screwed his glass into his eye, and greeted Bernard in his\nusual fashion--that is, as if he had parted with him overnight.\n\n“Oh, good morning! Beastly morning, is n’t it? I suppose you are come to\nluncheon--I have come to luncheon. It ought to be on table, you know--it\n‘s nearly two o’clock. But I dare say you have noticed foreigners are\nnever punctual--it ‘s only English servants that are punctual. And they\ndon’t understand luncheon, you know--they can’t make out our eating at\nthis sort of hour. You know they always dine so beastly early. Do you\nremember the sort of time they used to dine at Baden?--half-past five,\nhalf-past six; some unearthly hour of that kind. That ‘s the sort of\ntime you dine in America. I found they ‘d invite a man at half-past six.\nThat ‘s what I call being in a hurry for your food. You know they always\naccuse the Americans of making a rush for their victuals. I am bound\nto say that in New York, and that sort of place, the victuals were very\ngood when you got them. I hope you don’t mind my saying anything about\nAmerica? You know the Americans are so deucedly thin-skinned--they\nalways bristle up if you say anything against their institutions. The\nEnglish don’t care a rap what you say--they ‘ve got a different sort\nof temper, you know. With the Americans I ‘m deuced careful--I never\nbreathe a word about anything. While I was over there I went in for\nbeing complimentary. I laid it on thick, and I found they would take all\nI could give them. I did n’t see much of their institutions, after all;\nI went in for seeing the people. Some of the people were charming--upon\nmy soul, I was surprised at some of the people. I dare say you know some\nof the people I saw; they were as nice people as you would see anywhere.\nThere were always a lot of people about Mrs. Wright, you know; they\ntold me they were all the best people. You know she is always late for\neverything. She always comes in after every one is there--looking so\ndevilish pretty, pulling on her gloves. She wears the longest gloves I\never saw in my life. Upon my word, if they don’t come, I think I will\nring the bell and ask the waiter what ‘s the matter. Would n’t you ring\nthe bell? It ‘s a great mistake, their trying to carry out their ideas\nof lunching. That ‘s Wright’s character, you know; he ‘s always trying\nto carry out some idea. When I am abroad, I go in for the foreign\nbreakfast myself. You may depend upon it they had better give up trying\nto do this sort of thing at this hour.”\n\nCaptain Lovelock was more disposed to conversation than Bernard had\nknown him before. His discourse of old had been languid and fragmentary,\nand our hero had never heard him pursue a train of ideas through so\nmany involutions. To Bernard’s observant eye, indeed, the Captain was\nan altered man. His manner betrayed a certain restless desire to be\nagreeable, to anticipate judgment--a disposition to smile, and be civil,\nand entertain his auditor, a tendency to move about and look out of the\nwindow and at the clock. He struck Bernard as a trifle nervous--as\nless solidly planted on his feet than when he lounged along the Baden\ngravel-walks by the side of his usual companion--a lady for whom,\napparently, his admiration was still considerable. Bernard was curious\nto see whether he would ring the bell to inquire into the delay\nattending the service of lunch; but before this sentiment, rather idle\nunder the circumstances, was gratified, Blanche passed into the room\nfrom a neighboring apartment. To Bernard’s perception Blanche, at least,\nwas always Blanche; she was a person in whom it would not have occurred\nto him to expect any puzzling variation, and the tone of her little,\nsoft, thin voice instantly rang in his ear like an echo of yesterday’s\ntalk. He had already remarked to himself that after however long\nan interval one might see Blanche, she re-appeared with an air of\nfamiliarity. This was in some sense, indeed, a proof of the agreeable\nimpression she made, and she looked exceedingly pretty as she now\nsuddenly stopped on seeing our two gentlemen, and gave a little cry of\nsurprise.\n\n“Ah! I did n’t know you were here. They never told me. Have you been\nwaiting a long time? How d’ ye do? You must think we are polite.”\n She held out her hand to Bernard, smiling very graciously. At Captain\nLovelock she barely glanced. “I hope you are very well,” she went on to\nLongueville; “but I need n’t ask that. You ‘re as blooming as a rose.\nWhat in the world has happened to you? You look so brilliant--so fresh.\nCan you say that to a man--that he looks fresh? Or can you only say that\nabout butter and eggs?”\n\n“It depends upon the man,” said Captain Lovelock. “You can’t say that a\nman ‘s fresh who spends his time in running about after you!”\n\n“Ah, are you here?” cried Blanche with another little cry of surprise.\n“I did n’t notice you--I thought you were the waiter. This is what\nhe calls running about after me,” she added, to Bernard; “coming to\nbreakfast without being asked. How queerly they have arranged the\ntable!” she went on, gazing with her little elevated eyebrows at this\npiece of furniture. “I always thought that in Paris, if they could\nn’t do anything else, they could arrange a table. I don’t like that\nat all--those horrid little dishes on each side! Don’t you think those\nthings ought to be off the table, Mr. Longueville? I don’t like to see\na lot of things I ‘m not eating. And I told them to have some\nflowers--pray, where are the flowers? Do they call those things\nflowers? They look as if they had come out of the landlady’s bonnet! Mr.\nLongueville, do look at those objects.”\n\n“They are not like me--they are not very fresh,” laughed Bernard.\n\n“It ‘s no great matter--we have not got to eat them,” growled Captain\nLovelock.\n\n“I should think you would expect to--with the luncheon you usually\nmake!” rejoined Blanche. “Since you are here, though I did n’t ask you,\nyou might as well make yourself useful. Will you be so good as to ring\nthe bell? If Gordon expects that we are going to wait another quarter of\nan hour for him he exaggerates the patience of a long-suffering wife. If\nyou are very curious to know what he is about, he is writing letters, by\nway of a change. He writes about eighty a day; his correspondents\nmust be strong people! It ‘s a lucky thing for me that I am married\nto Gordon; if I were not he might write to me--to me, to whom it ‘s a\nmisery to have to answer even an invitation to dinner! To begin with, I\ndon’t know how to spell. If Captain Lovelock ever boasts that he has\nhad letters from me, you may know it ‘s an invention. He has never had\nanything but telegrams--three telegrams--that I sent him in America\nabout a pair of slippers that he had left at our house and that I did\nn’t know what to do with. Captain Lovelock’s slippers are no trifle\nto have on one’s hands--on one’s feet, I suppose I ought to say. For\ntelegrams the spelling does n’t matter; the people at the office correct\nit--or if they don’t you can put it off on them. I never see anything\nnowadays but Gordon’s back,” she went on, as they took their places at\ntable--“his noble broad back, as he sits writing his letters. That ‘s my\nprincipal view of my husband. I think that now we are in Paris I ought\nto have a portrait of it by one of the great artists. It would be such a\ncharacteristic pose. I have quite forgotten his face and I don’t think I\nshould know it.”\n\nGordon’s face, however, presented itself just at this moment; he came in\nquickly, with his countenance flushed with the pleasure of meeting his\nold friend again. He had the sun-scorched look of a traveller who has\njust crossed the Atlantic, and he smiled at Bernard with his honest\neyes.\n\n“Don’t think me a great brute for not being here to receive you,” he\nsaid, as he clasped his hand. “I was writing an important letter and I\nput it to myself in this way: ‘If I interrupt my letter I shall have to\ncome back and finish it; whereas if I finish it now, I can have all the\nrest of the day to spend with him.’ So I stuck to it to the end, and now\nwe can be inseparable.”\n\n“You may be sure Gordon reasoned it out,” said Blanche, while her\nhusband offered his hand in silence to Captain Lovelock.\n\n“Gordon’s reasoning is as fine as other people’s feeling!” declared\nBernard, who was conscious of a desire to say something very pleasant to\nGordon, and who did not at all approve of Blanche’s little ironical tone\nabout her husband.\n\n“And Bernard’s compliments are better than either,” said Gordon,\nlaughing and taking his seat at table.\n\n“I have been paying him compliments,” Blanche went on. “I have been\ntelling him he looks so brilliant, so blooming--as if something had\nhappened to him, as if he had inherited a fortune. He must have been\ndoing something very wicked, and he ought to tell us all about it,\nto amuse us. I am sure you are a dreadful Parisian, Mr. Longueville.\nRemember that we are three dull, virtuous people, exceedingly bored\nwith each other’s society, and wanting to hear something strange and\nexciting. If it ‘s a little improper, that won’t spoil it.”\n\n“You certainly are looking uncommonly well,” said Gordon, still smiling,\nacross the table, at his friend. “I see what Blanche means--”\n\n“My dear Gordon, that ‘s a great event,” his wife interposed.\n\n“It ‘s a good deal to pretend, certainly,” he went on, smiling always,\nwith his red face and his blue eyes. “But this is no great credit to me,\nbecause Bernard’s superb condition would strike any one. You look as if\nyou were going to marry the Lord Mayor’s daughter!”\n\nIf Bernard was blooming, his bloom at this juncture must have deepened,\nand in so doing indeed have contributed an even brighter tint to his\nexpression of salubrious happiness. It was one of the rare occasions of\nhis life when he was at a loss for a verbal expedient.\n\n“It ‘s a great match,” he nevertheless murmured, jestingly. “You must\nexcuse my inflated appearance.”\n\n“It has absorbed you so much that you have had no time to write to me,”\n said Gordon. “I expected to hear from you after you arrived.”\n\n“I wrote to you a fortnight ago--just before receiving your own letter.\nYou left New York before my letter reached it.”\n\n“Ah, it will have crossed us,” said Gordon. “But now that we have your\nsociety I don’t care. Your letters, of course, are delightful, but that\nis still better.”\n\nIn spite of this sympathetic statement Bernard cannot be said to have\nenjoyed his lunch; he was thinking of something else that lay before him\nand that was not agreeable. He was like a man who has an acrobatic feat\nto perform--a wide ditch to leap, a high pole to climb--and who has a\npresentiment of fractures and bruises. Fortunately he was not obliged to\ntalk much, as Mrs. Gordon displayed even more than her usual vivacity,\nrendering her companions the graceful service of lifting the burden of\nconversation from their shoulders.\n\n“I suppose you were surprised to see us rushing out here so suddenly,”\n she observed in the course of the repast. “We had said nothing about\nit when you last saw us, and I believe we are supposed to tell you\neverything, ain’t we? I certainly have told you a great many things, and\nthere are some of them I hope you have n’t repeated. I have no doubt\nyou have told them all over Paris, but I don’t care what you tell in\nParis--Paris is n’t so easily shocked. Captain Lovelock does n’t repeat\nwhat I tell him; I set him up as a model of discretion. I have told him\nsome pretty bad things, and he has liked them so much he has kept them\nall to himself. I say my bad things to Captain Lovelock, and my good\nthings to other people; he does n’t know the difference and he is\nperfectly content.”\n\n“Other people as well often don’t know the difference,” said Gordon,\ngravely. “You ought always to tell us which are which.”\n\nBlanche gave her husband a little impertinent stare.\n\n“When I am not appreciated,” she said, with an attempt at superior\ndryness, “I am too proud to point it out. I don’t know whether you know\nthat I ‘m proud,” she went on, turning to Gordon and glancing at Captain\nLovelock; “it ‘s a good thing to know. I suppose Gordon will say that I\nought to be too proud to point that out; but what are you to do when no\none has any imagination? You have a grain or two, Mr. Longueville; but\nCaptain Lovelock has n’t a speck. As for Gordon, je n’en parle pas! But\neven you, Mr. Longueville, would never imagine that I am an interesting\ninvalid--that we are travelling for my delicate health. The doctors have\nn’t given me up, but I have given them up. I know I don’t look as if I\nwere out of health; but that ‘s because I always try to look my best.\nMy appearance proves nothing--absolutely nothing. Do you think my\nappearance proves anything, Captain Lovelock?”\n\nCaptain Lovelock scrutinized Blanche’s appearance with a fixed and\nsolemn eye; and then he replied--\n\n“It proves you are very lovely.”\n\nBlanche kissed her finger-tips to him in return for this compliment.\n\n“You only need to give Captain Lovelock a chance,” she rattled on, “and\nhe is as clever as any one. That ‘s what I like to do to my friends--I\nlike to make chances for them. Captain Lovelock is like my dear little\nblue terrier that I left at home. If I hold out a stick he will jump\nover it. He won’t jump without the stick; but as soon as I produce it he\nknows what he has to do. He looks at it a moment and then he gives his\nlittle hop. He knows he will have a lump of sugar, and Captain Lovelock\nexpects one as well. Dear Captain Lovelock, shall I ring for a lump?\nWould n’t it be touching? Garcon, un morceau de sucre pour Monsieur\nle Capitaine! But what I give Monsieur le Capitaine is moral sugar! I\nusually administer it in private, and he shall have a good big morsel\nwhen you go away.”\n\nGordon got up, turning to Bernard and looking at his watch.\n\n“Let us go away, in that case,” he said, smiling, “and leave Captain\nLovelock to receive his reward. We will go and take a walk; we will go\nup the Champs Elysees. Good morning, Monsieur le Capitaine.”\n\nNeither Blanche nor the Captain offered any opposition to this proposal,\nand Bernard took leave of his hostess and joined Gordon, who had already\npassed into the antechamber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nGordon took his arm and they gained the street; they strolled in the\ndirection of the Champs Elysees.\n\n“For a little exercise and a good deal of talk, it ‘s the pleasantest\nplace,” said Gordon. “I have a good deal to say; I have a good deal to\nask you.”\n\nBernard felt the familiar pressure of his friend’s hand, as it rested on\nhis arm, and it seemed to him never to have lain there with so heavy a\nweight. It held him fast--it held him to account; it seemed a physical\nsymbol of responsibility. Bernard was not re-assured by hearing that\nGordon had a great deal to say, and he expected a sudden explosion of\nbitterness on the subject of Blanche’s irremediable triviality. The\nafternoon was a lovely one--the day was a perfect example of the\nmellowest mood of autumn. The air was warm and filled with a golden\nhaze, which seemed to hang about the bare Parisian trees, as if with a\ntender impulse to drape their nakedness. A fine day in Paris brings\nout a wonderfully bright and appreciative multitude of strollers and\nloungers, and the liberal spaces of the Champs Elysees were on this\noccasion filled with those placid votaries of inexpensive entertainment\nwho abound in the French capital. The benches and chairs on the edge of\nthe great avenue exhibited a dense fraternity of gazers, and up and down\nthe broad walk passed the slow-moving and easily pleased pedestrians.\nGordon, in spite of his announcement that he had a good deal to say,\nconfined himself at first to superficial allusions, and Bernard after a\nwhile had the satisfaction of perceiving that he was not likely, for the\nmoment, to strike the note of conjugal discord. He appeared, indeed, to\nfeel no desire to speak of Blanche in any manner whatever. He fell into\nthe humor of the hour and the scene, looked at the crowd, talked about\ntrifles. He remarked that Paris was a wonderful place after all, and\nthat a little glimpse of the Parisian picture was a capital thing as a\nchange; said he was very glad they had come, and that for his part he\nwas willing to stay three months.\n\n“And what have you been doing with yourself?” he asked. “How have you\nbeen occupied, and what are you meaning to do?”\n\nBernard said nothing for a moment, and Gordon presently glanced at\nhis face to see why he was silent. Bernard, looking askance, met his\ncompanion’s eyes, and then, resting his own upon them, he stopped short.\nHis heart was beating; it was a question of saying to Gordon outright,\n“I have been occupied in becoming engaged to Angela Vivian.” But he\ncould n’t say it, and yet he must say something. He tried to invent\nsomething; but he could think of nothing, and still Gordon was looking\nat him.\n\n“I am so glad to see you!” he exclaimed, for want of something better;\nand he blushed--he felt foolish, he felt false--as he said it.\n\n“My dear Bernard!” Gordon murmured gratefully, as they walked on. “It\n‘s very good of you to say that; I am very glad we are together again.\nI want to say something,” he added, in a moment; “I hope you won’t\nmind it--” Bernard gave a little laugh at his companion’s scruples, and\nGordon continued. “To tell the truth, it has sometimes seemed to me that\nwe were not so good friends as we used to be--that something had come\nbetween us--I don’t know what, I don’t know why. I don’t know what to\ncall it but a sort of lowering of the temperature. I don’t know whether\nyou have felt it, or whether it has been simply a fancy of mine.\nWhatever it may have been, it ‘s all over, is n’t it? We are too old\nfriends--too good friends--not to stick together. Of course, the rubs of\nlife may occasionally loosen the cohesion; but it is very good to feel\nthat, with a little direct contact, it may easily be re-established.\nIs n’t that so? But we should n’t reason about these things; one feels\nthem, and that ‘s enough.”\n\nGordon spoke in his clear, cheerful voice, and Bernard listened\nintently. It seemed to him there was an undertone of pain and effort in\nhis companion’s speech; it was that of an unhappy man trying to be wise\nand make the best of things.\n\n“Ah, the rubs of life--the rubs of life!” Bernard repeated vaguely.\n\n“We must n’t mind them,” said Gordon, with a conscientious laugh.\n“We must toughen our hides; or, at the worst, we must plaster up our\nbruises. But why should we choose this particular place and hour for\ntalking of the pains of life?” he went on. “Are we not in the midst of\nits pleasures? I mean, henceforth, to cultivate its pleasures. What\nare yours, just now, Bernard? Is n’t it supposed that in Paris one must\namuse one’s self? How have you been amusing yourself?”\n\n“I have been leading a very quiet life,” said Bernard.\n\n“I notice that ‘s what people always say when they have been\nparticularly dissipated. What have you done? Whom have you seen that one\nknows?”\n\nBernard was silent a moment.\n\n“I have seen some old friends of yours,” he said at last. “I have seen\nMrs. Vivian and her daughter.”\n\n“Ah!” Gordon made this exclamation, and then stopped short. Bernard\nlooked at him, but Gordon was looking away; his eyes had caught some one\nin the crowd. Bernard followed the direction they had taken, and then\nGordon went on: “Talk of the devil--excuse the adage! Are not those the\nladies in question?”\n\nMrs. Vivian and her daughter were, in fact, seated among a great many\nother quiet people, in a couple of hired chairs, at the edge of the\ngreat avenue. They were turned toward our two friends, and when Bernard\ndistinguished them, in the well-dressed multitude, they were looking\nstraight at Gordon Wright.\n\n“They see you!” said Bernard.\n\n“You say that as if I wished to run away,” Gordon answered. “I don’t\nwant to run away; on the contrary, I want to speak to them.”\n\n“That ‘s easily done,” said Bernard, and they advanced to the two\nladies.\n\nMrs. Vivian and her daughter rose from their chairs as they came; they\nhad evidently rapidly exchanged observations, and had decided that\nit would facilitate their interview with Gordon Wright to receive him\nstanding. He made his way to them through the crowd, blushing deeply,\nas he always did when excited; then he stood there bare-headed,\nshaking hands with each of them, with a fixed smile, and with nothing,\napparently, to say. Bernard watched Angela’s face; she was giving his\ncompanion a beautiful smile. Mrs. Vivian was delicately cordial.\n\n“I was sure it was you,” said Gordon at last. “We were just talking of\nyou.”\n\n“Did Mr. Longueville deny it was we?” asked Mrs. Vivian, archly; “after\nwe had supposed that we had made an impression on him!”\n\n“I knew you were in Paris--we were in the act of talking of you,” Gordon\nwent on. “I am very glad to see you.”\n\nBernard had shaken hands with Angela, looking at her intently; and in\nher eyes, as his own met them, it seemed to him that there was a gleam\nof mockery. At whom was she mocking--at Gordon, or at himself? Bernard\nwas uncomfortable enough not to care to be mocked; but he felt even more\nsorry that Gordon should be.\n\n“We also knew you were coming--Mr. Longueville had told us,” said Mrs.\nVivian; “and we have been expecting the pleasure of seeing Blanche. Dear\nlittle Blanche!”\n\n“Dear little Blanche will immediately come and see you,” Gordon replied.\n\n“Immediately, we hope,” said Mrs. Vivian. “We shall be so very glad.”\n Bernard perceived that she wished to say something soothing and\nsympathetic to poor Gordon; having it, as he supposed, on her\nconscience that, after having once encouraged him to regard himself\nas indispensable (in the capacity of son-in-law) to her happiness,\nshe should now present to him the spectacle of a felicity which had\nestablished itself without his aid. “We were so very much interested in\nyour marriage,” she went on. “We thought it so--so delightful.”\n\nGordon fixed his eyes on the ground for a moment.\n\n“I owe it partly to you,” he answered. “You had done so much for\nBlanche. You had so cultivated her mind and polished her manners that\nher attractions were doubled, and I fell an easy victim to them.”\n\nHe uttered these words with an exaggerated solemnity, the result of\nwhich was to produce, for a moment, an almost embarrassing silence.\nBernard was rapidly becoming more and more impatient of his own\nembarrassment, and now he exclaimed, in a loud and jovial voice--\n\n“Blanche makes victims by the dozen! I was a victim last winter; we are\nall victims!”\n\n“Dear little Blanche!” Mrs. Vivian murmured again.\n\nAngela had said nothing; she had simply stood there, making no attempt\nto address herself to Gordon, and yet with no affectation of reserve or\nof indifference. Now she seemed to feel the impulse to speak to him.\n\n“When Blanche comes to see us, you must be sure to come with her,” she\nsaid, with a friendly smile.\n\nGordon looked at her, but he said nothing.\n\n“We were so sorry to hear she is out of health,” Angela went on.\n\nStill Gordon was silent, with his eyes fixed on her expressive and\ncharming face.\n\n“It is not serious,” he murmured at last.\n\n“She used to be so well--so bright,” said Angela, who also appeared to\nhave the desire to say something kind and comfortable.\n\nGordon made no response to this; he only looked at her.\n\n“I hope you are well, Miss Vivian,” he broke out at last.\n\n“Very well, thank you.”\n\n“Do you live in Paris?”\n\n“We have pitched our tent here for the present.”\n\n“Do you like it?”\n\n“I find it no worse than other places.”\n\nGordon appeared to desire to talk with her; but he could think of\nnothing to say. Talking with her was a pretext for looking at her;\nand Bernard, who thought she had never been so handsome as at that\nparticular moment, smiling at her troubled ex-lover, could easily\nconceive that his friend should desire to prolong this privilege.\n\n“Have you been sitting here long?” Gordon asked, thinking of something\nat last.\n\n“Half an hour. We came out to walk, and my mother felt tired. It is time\nwe should turn homeward,” Angela added.\n\n“Yes, I am tired, my daughter. We must take a voiture, if Mr.\nLongueville will be so good as to find us one,” said Mrs. Vivian.\n\nBernard, professing great alacrity, looked about him; but he still\nlingered near his companions. Gordon had thought of something else.\n“Have you been to Baden again?” Bernard heard him ask. But at this\nmoment Bernard espied at a distance an empty hackney-carriage crawling\nup the avenue, and he was obliged to go and signal to it. When he came\nback, followed by the vehicle, the two ladies, accompanied by Gordon,\nhad come to the edge of the pavement. They shook hands with Gordon\nbefore getting into the cab, and Mrs. Vivian exclaimed--\n\n“Be sure you give our love to your dear wife!”\n\nThen the two ladies settled themselves and smiled their adieux, and the\nlittle victoria rumbled away at an easy pace, while Bernard stood with\nGordon, looking after it. They watched it a moment, and then Gordon\nturned to his companion. He looked at Bernard for some moments intently,\nwith a singular expression.\n\n“It is strange for me to see her!” he said, presently.\n\n“I hope it is not altogether disagreeable,” Bernard answered smiling.\n\n“She is delightfully handsome,” Gordon went on.\n\n“She is a beautiful woman.”\n\n“And the strange thing is that she strikes me now so differently,”\n Gordon continued. “I used to think her so mysterious--so ambiguous. She\nseems to be now so simple.”\n\n“Ah,” said Bernard, laughing, “that’s an improvement!”\n\n“So simple and so good!” Gordon exclaimed.\n\nBernard laid his hand on his companion’s shoulder, shaking his head\nslowly.\n\n“You must not think too much about that,” he said.\n\n“So simple--so good--so charming!” Gordon repeated.\n\n“Ah, my dear Gordon!” Bernard murmured.\n\nBut still Gordon continued.\n\n“So intelligent, so reasonable, so sensible.”\n\n“Have you discovered all that in two minutes’ talk?”\n\n“Yes, in two minutes’ talk. I should n’t hesitate about her now!”\n\n“It ‘s better you should n’t say that,” said Bernard.\n\n“Why should n’t I say it? It seems to me it ‘s my duty to say it.”\n\n“No--your duty lies elsewhere,” said Bernard. “There are two reasons.\nOne is that you have married another woman.”\n\n“What difference does that make?” cried Gordon.\n\nBernard made no attempt to answer this inquiry; he simply went on--\n\n“The other is--the other is--”\n\nBut here he paused.\n\n“What is the other?” Gordon asked.\n\n“That I am engaged to marry Miss Vivian.”\n\nAnd with this Bernard took his hand off Gordon’s shoulder.\n\nGordon stood staring.\n\n“To marry Miss Vivian?”\n\nNow that Bernard had heard himself say it, audibly, distinctly, loudly,\nthe spell of his apprehension seemed broken, and he went on bravely.\n\n“We are to be married very shortly. It has all come about within a few\nweeks. It will seem to you very strange--perhaps you won’t like it. That\n‘s why I have hesitated to tell you.”\n\nGordon turned pale; it was the first time Bernard had ever seen him do\nso; evidently he did not like it. He stood staring and frowning.\n\n“Why, I thought--I thought,” he began at last--“I thought that you\ndisliked her!”\n\n“I supposed so, too,” said Bernard. “But I have got over that.”\n\nGordon turned away, looking up the great avenue into the crowd. Then\nturning back, he said--\n\n“I am very much surprised.”\n\n“And you are not pleased!”\n\nGordon fixed his eyes on the ground a moment.\n\n“I congratulate you on your engagement,” he said at last, looking up\nwith a face that seemed to Bernard hard and unnatural.\n\n“It is very good of you to say that, but of course you can’t like it! I\nwas sure you would n’t like it. But what could I do? I fell in love with\nher, and I could n’t run away simply to spare you a surprise. My dear\nGordon,” Bernard added, “you will get used to it.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Gordon, dryly. “But you must give me time.”\n\n“As long as you like!”\n\nGordon stood for a moment again staring down at the ground.\n\n“Very well, then, I will take my time,” he said. “Good-bye!”\n\nAnd he turned away, as if to walk off alone.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked Bernard, stopping him.\n\n“I don’t know--to the hotel, anywhere. To try to get used to what you\nhave told me.”\n\n“Don’t try too hard; it will come of itself,” said Bernard.\n\n“We shall see!”\n\nAnd Gordon turned away again.\n\n“Do you prefer to go alone?”\n\n“Very much--if you will excuse me!”\n\n“I have asked you to excuse a greater want of ceremony!” said Bernard,\nsmiling.\n\n“I have not done so yet!” Gordon rejoined; and marching off, he mingled\nwith the crowd.\n\nBernard watched him till he lost sight of him, and then, dropping into\nthe first empty chair that he saw, he sat and reflected that his friend\nliked it quite as little as he had feared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nBernard sat thinking for a long time; at first with a good deal of\nmortification--at last with a good deal of bitterness. He felt angry\nat last; but he was not angry with himself. He was displeased with poor\nGordon, and with Gordon’s displeasure. He was uncomfortable, and he was\nvexed at his discomfort. It formed, it seemed to him, no natural part of\nhis situation; he had had no glimpse of it in the book of fate where he\nregistered on a fair blank page his betrothal to a charming girl. That\nGordon should be surprised, and even a little shocked and annoyed--this\nwas his right and his privilege; Bernard had been prepared for that, and\nhad determined to make the best of it. But it must not go too far; there\nwere limits to the morsel of humble pie that he was disposed to swallow.\nSomething in Gordon’s air and figure, as he went off in a huff, looking\nvicious and dangerous--yes, that was positively his look--left a\nsinister impression on Bernard’s mind, and, after a while, made him\nglad to take refuge in being angry. One would like to know what Gordon\nexpected, par exemple! Did he expect Bernard to give up Angela simply\nto save him a shock; or to back out of his engagement by way of an ideal\nreparation? No, it was too absurd, and, if Gordon had a wife of his own,\nwhy in the name of justice should not Bernard have one?\n\nBeing angry was a relief, but it was not exactly a solution, and\nBernard, at last, leaving his place, where for an hour or two he had\nbeen absolutely unconscious of everything that went on around him,\nwandered about for some time in deep restlessness and irritation. At\none moment he thought of going back to Gordon’s hotel, to see him, to\nexplain. But then he became aware that he was too angry for that--to say\nnothing of Gordon’s being too angry also; and, moreover, that there\nwas nothing to explain. He was to marry Angela Vivian; that was a\nvery simple fact--it needed no explanation. Was it so wonderful, so\ninconceivable, an incident so unlikely to happen? He went, as he always\ndid on Sunday, to dine with Mrs. Vivian, and it seemed to him that he\nperceived in the two ladies some symptoms of a discomposure which had\nthe same origin as his own. Bernard, on this occasion, at dinner, failed\nto make himself particularly agreeable; he ate fast--as if he had no\nidea what he was eating, and talked little; every now and then his\neyes rested for some time upon Angela, with a strange, eagerly excited\nexpression, as if he were looking her over and trying to make up his\nmind about her afresh. This young lady bore his inscrutable scrutiny\nwith a deal of superficial composure; but she was also silent, and she\nreturned his gaze, from time to time, with an air of unusual anxiety.\nShe was thinking, of course, of Gordon, Bernard said to himself; and a\nwoman’s first meeting, in after years, with an ex-lover must always make\na certain impression upon her. Gordon, however, had never been a\nlover, and if Bernard noted Angela’s gravity it was not because he felt\njealous. “She is simply sorry for him,” he said to himself; and by the\ntime he had finished his dinner it began to come back to him that he\nwas sorry, too. Mrs. Vivian was probably sorry as well, for she had a\nslightly confused and preoccupied look--a look from which, even in the\nmidst of his chagrin, Bernard extracted some entertainment. It was Mrs.\nVivian’s intermittent conscience that had been reminded of one of its\nlapses; her meeting with Gordon Wright had recalled the least exemplary\nepisode of her life--the time when she whispered mercenary counsel in\nthe ear of a daughter who sat, grave and pale, looking at her with eyes\nthat wondered. Mrs. Vivian blushed a little now, when she met Bernard’s\neyes; and to remind herself that she was after all a virtuous woman,\ntalked as much as possible about superior and harmless things--the\nbeauty of the autumn weather, the pleasure of seeing French papas\nwalking about on Sunday with their progeny in their hands, the\npeculiarities of the pulpit-oratory of the country as exemplified in\nthe discourse of a Protestant pasteur whom she had been to hear in the\nmorning.\n\nWhen they rose from table and went back into her little drawing-room,\nshe left her daughter alone for awhile with Bernard. The two were\nstanding together before the fire; Bernard watched Mrs. Vivian close the\ndoor softly behind her. Then, looking for a moment at his companion--\n\n“He is furious!” he announced at last.\n\n“Furious?” said Angela. “Do you mean Mr. Wright?”\n\n“The amiable, reasonable Gordon. He takes it very hard.”\n\n“Do you mean about me?” asked Angela.\n\n“It ‘s not with you he ‘s furious, of course; it is with me. He won’t\nlet me off easily.”\n\nAngela looked for a moment at the fire.\n\n“I am very sorry for him,” she said, at last.\n\n“It seems to me I am the one to be pitied,” said Bernard; “and I don’t\nsee what compassion you, of all people in the world, owe him.”\n\nAngela again rested her eyes on the fire; then presently, looking up--\n\n“He liked me very much,” she remarked.\n\n“All the more shame to him!” cried Bernard.\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the girl, with her beautiful stare.\n\n“If he liked you, why did he give you up?”\n\n“He did n’t give me up.”\n\n“What do you mean, please?” asked Bernard, staring back at her.\n\n“I sent him away--I refused him,” said Angela.\n\n“Yes; but you thought better of it, and your mother had persuaded you\nthat if he should ask you again, you had better accept him. Then it was\nthat he backed out--in consequence of what I said to him on his return\nfrom England.”\n\nShe shook her head slowly, with a strange smile.\n\n“My poor Bernard, you are talking very wildly. He did ask me again.”\n\n“That night?” cried Bernard.\n\n“The night he came back from England--the last time I saw him, until\nto-day.”\n\n“After I had denounced you?” our puzzled hero exclaimed, frowning\nportentously.\n\n“I am sorry to let you know the small effect of your words!”\n\nBernard folded his hands together--almost devoutly--and stood gazing at\nher with a long, inarticulate murmur of satisfaction.\n\n“Ah! then, I did n’t injure you--I did n’t deprive you of a chance?”\n\n“Oh, sir, the intention on your part was the same!” Angela exclaimed.\n\n“Then all my uneasiness, all my remorse, were wasted?” he went on.\n\nBut she kept the same tone, and its tender archness only gave a greater\nsweetness to his sense of relief.\n\n“It was a very small penance for you to pay.”\n\n“You dismissed him definitely, and that was why he vanished?” asked\nBernard, wondering still.\n\n“He gave me another ‘chance,’ as you elegantly express it, and I\ndeclined to take advantage of it.”\n\n“Ah, well, now,” cried Bernard, “I am sorry for him!”\n\n“I was very kind--very respectful,” said Angela. “I thanked him from the\nbottom of my heart; I begged his pardon very humbly for the wrong--if\nwrong it was--that I was doing him. I did n’t in the least require of\nhim that he should leave Baden at seven o’clock the next morning. I had\nno idea that he would do so, and that was the reason that I insisted to\nmy mother that we ourselves should go away. When we went I knew nothing\nabout his having gone, and I supposed he was still there. I did n’t wish\nto meet him again.”\n\nAngela gave this information slowly, softly, with pauses between the\nsentences, as if she were recalling the circumstances with a certain\neffort; and meanwhile Bernard, with his transfigured face and his eyes\nfixed upon her lips, was moving excitedly about the room.\n\n“Well, he can’t accuse me, then!” he broke out again. “If what I said\nhad no more effect upon him than that, I certainly did him no wrong.”\n\n“I think you are rather vexed he did n’t believe you,” said Angela.\n\n“I confess I don’t understand it. He had all the air of it. He certainly\nhad not the air of a man who was going to rush off and give you the last\nproof of his confidence.”\n\n“It was not a proof of confidence,” said Angela. “It had nothing to\ndo with me. It was as between himself and you; it was a proof of\nindependence. He did believe you, more or less, and what you said fell\nin with his own impressions--strange impressions that they were, poor\nman! At the same time, as I say, he liked me, too; it was out of his\nliking me that all his trouble came! He caught himself in the act of\nlistening to you too credulously--and that seemed to him unmanly and\ndishonorable. The sensation brought with it a reaction, and to prove\nto himself that in such a matter he could be influenced by nobody, he\nmarched away, an hour after he had talked with you, and, in the teeth\nof his perfect mistrust, confirmed by your account of my\nirregularities--heaven forgive you both!--again asked me to be his wife.\nBut he hoped I would refuse!”\n\n“Ah,” cried Bernard, “the recreant! He deserved--he deserved--”\n\n“That I should accept him?” Angela asked, smiling still.\n\nBernard was so much affected by this revelation, it seemed to him to\nmake such a difference in his own responsibility and to lift such a\nweight off his conscience, that he broke out again into the liveliest\nejaculations of relief.\n\n“Oh, I don’t care for anything, now, and I can do what I please! Gordon\nmay hate me, and I shall be sorry for him; but it ‘s not my fault, and I\nowe him no reparation. No, no; I am free!”\n\n“It ‘s only I who am not, I suppose,” said Angela, “and the reparation\nmust come from me! If he is unhappy, I must take the responsibility.”\n\n“Ah yes, of course,” said Bernard, kissing her.\n\n“But why should he be unhappy?” asked Angela. “If I refused him, it was\nwhat he wanted.”\n\n“He is hard to please,” Bernard rejoined. “He has got a wife of his\nown.”\n\n“If Blanche does n’t please him, he is certainly difficult;” and Angela\nmused a little. “But you told me the other day that they were getting on\nso well.”\n\n“Yes, I believe I told you,” Bernard answered, musing a little too.\n\n“You are not attending to what I say.”\n\n“No, I am thinking of something else--I am thinking of what it was that\nmade you refuse him that way, at the last, after you had let your mother\nhope.” And Bernard stood there, smiling at her.\n\n“Don’t think any more; you will not find out,” the girl declared,\nturning away.\n\n“Ah, it was cruel of you to let me think I was wrong all these years,”\n he went on; “and, at the time, since you meant to refuse him, you might\nhave been more frank with me.”\n\n“I thought my fault had been that I was too frank.”\n\n“I was densely stupid, and you might have made me understand better.”\n\n“Ah,” said Angela, “you ask a great deal of a girl!”\n\n“Why have you let me go on so long thinking that my deluded words had\nhad an effect upon Gordon--feeling that I had done you a brutal wrong?\nIt was real to me, the wrong--and I have told you of the pangs and the\nshame which, for so many months, it has cost me! Why have you never\nundeceived me until to-day, and then only by accident?”\n\nAt this question Angela blushed a little; then she answered, smiling--\n\n“It was my vengeance.”\n\nBernard shook his head.\n\n“That won’t do--you don’t mean it. You never cared--you were too proud\nto care; and when I spoke to you about my fault, you did n’t even know\nwhat I meant. You might have told me, therefore, that my remorse\nwas idle, that what I said to Gordon had not been of the smallest\nconsequence, and that the rupture had come from yourself.”\n\nFor some time Angela said nothing, then at last she gave him one of the\ndeeply serious looks with which her face was occasionally ornamented.\n\n“If you want really to know, then--can’t you see that your remorse\nseemed to me connected in a certain way with your affection; a sort of\nguarantee of it? You thought you had injured some one or other, and\nthat seemed to be mixed up with your loving me, and therefore I let it\nalone.”\n\n“Ah,” said Bernard, “my remorse is all gone, and yet I think I love you\nabout as much as ever! So you see how wrong you were not to tell me.”\n\n“The wrong to you I don’t care about. It is very true I might have told\nyou for Mr. Wright’s sake. It would perhaps have made him look better.\nBut as you never attacked him for deserting me, it seemed needless for\nme to defend him.”\n\n\n\n“I confess,” said Bernard, “I am quite at sea about Gordon’s look in\nthe matter. Is he looking better now--or is he looking worse? You put it\nvery well just now; I was attending to you, though you said I was not.\nIf he hoped you would refuse him, with whom is his quarrel at present?\nAnd why was he so cool to me for months after we parted at Baden? If\nthat was his state of mind, why should he accuse me of inconsistency?”\n\n“There is something in it, after all, that a woman can understand. I\ndon’t know whether a man can. He hoped I would refuse him, and yet when\nI had done so he was vexed. After a while his vexation subsided, and he\nmarried poor Blanche; but, on learning to-day that I had accepted you,\nit flickered up again. I suppose that was natural enough; but it won’t\nbe serious.”\n\n“What will not be serious, my dear?” asked Mrs. Vivian, who had come\nback to the drawing-room, and who, apparently, could not hear that the\nattribute in question was wanting in any direction, without some alarm.\n\n“Shall I tell mamma, Bernard?” said Angela.\n\n“Ah, my dear child, I hope it ‘s nothing that threatens your mutual\nhappiness,” mamma murmured, with gentle earnestness.\n\n“Does it threaten our mutual happiness, Bernard?” the girl went on,\nsmiling.\n\n“Let Mrs. Vivian decide whether we ought to let it make us miserable,”\n said Bernard. “Dear Mrs. Vivian, you are a casuist, and this is a nice\ncase.”\n\n“Is it anything about poor Mr. Wright?” the elder lady inquired.\n\n“Why do you say ‘poor’ Mr. Wright?” asked Bernard.\n\n“Because I am sadly afraid he is not happy with Blanche.”\n\n“How did you discover that--without seeing them together?”\n\n“Well, perhaps you will think me very fanciful,” said Mrs. Vivian; “but\nit was by the way he looked at Angela. He has such an expressive face.”\n\n“He looked at me very kindly, mamma,” Angela observed.\n\n“He regularly stared, my daughter. In any one else I should have said\nit was rude. But his situation is so peculiar; and one could see that he\nadmired you still.” And Mrs. Vivian gave a little soft sigh.\n\n“Ah! she is thinking of the thirty thousand a year,” Bernard said to\nhimself.\n\n“I am sure I hope he admires me still,” the girl cried, laughing. “There\nis no great harm in that.”\n\n“He was comparing you with Blanche--and he was struck with the\ncontrast.”\n\n“It could n’t have been in my favor. If it ‘s a question of being looked\nat, Blanche bears it better than I.”\n\n“Poor little Blanche!” murmured Mrs. Vivian, sweetly.\n\n“Why did you tell me he was so happy with her?” Angela asked, turning to\nBernard, abruptly.\n\nBernard gazed at her a moment, with his eyebrows raised.\n\n“I never saw any one ask such sudden questions!” he exclaimed.\n\n“You can answer me at your leisure,” she rejoined, turning away.\n\n“It was because I adored you.”\n\n“You would n’t say that at your leisure,” said the girl.\n\nMrs. Vivian stood watching them.\n\n“You, who are so happy together, you ought to think kindly of others who\nare less fortunate.”\n\n“That is very true, Mrs. Vivian; and I have never thought of any one so\nkindly as I have of Gordon for the last year.”\n\nAngela turned round again.\n\n“Is Blanche so very bad, then?”\n\n“You will see for yourself!”\n\n“Ah, no,” said Mrs. Vivian, “she is not bad; she is only very light. I\nam so glad she is to be near us again. I think a great deal can be done\nby association. We must help her, Angela. I think we helped her before.”\n\n“It is also very true that she is light, Mrs. Vivian,” Bernard observed,\n“and if you could make her a little heavier, I should be tremendously\ngrateful.”\n\nBernard’s prospective mother-in-law looked at him a little.\n\n“I don’t know whether you are laughing at me--I always think you are.\nBut I shall not give up Blanche for that. I never give up any one that I\nhave once tried to help. Blanche will come back to me.”\n\nMrs. Vivian had hardly spoken when the sharp little vibration of her\ndoor-bell was heard in the hall. Bernard stood for a moment looking at\nthe door of the drawing-room.\n\n“It is poor Gordon come to make a scene!” he announced.\n\n“Is that what you mean--that he opposed your marriage?” asked Mrs.\nVivian, with a frightened air.\n\n“I don’t know what he proposes to do with Blanche,” said Bernard,\nlaughing.\n\nThere were voices in the hall. Angela had been listening.\n\n“You say she will come back to you, mamma,” she exclaimed. “Here she is\narrived!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nAt the same moment the door was thrown open, and Mrs. Gordon appeared\non the threshold with a gentleman behind her. Blanche stood an instant\nlooking into the lighted room and hesitating--flushed a little, smiling,\nextremely pretty.\n\n“May I come in?” she said, “and may I bring in Captain Lovelock?”\n\nThe two ladies, of course, fluttering toward her with every\ndemonstration of hospitality, drew her into the room, while Bernard\nproceeded to greet the Captain, who advanced with a certain awkward and\nbashful majesty, almost sweeping with his great stature Mrs. Vivian’s\nhumble ceiling. There was a tender exchange of embraces between Blanche\nand her friends, and the charming visitor, losing no time, began to\nchatter with her usual volubility. Mrs. Vivian and Angela made her\ncompanion graciously welcome; but Blanche begged they would n’t mind\nhim--she had only brought him as a watch-dog.\n\n“His place is on the rug,” she said. “Captain Lovelock, go and lie down\non the rug.”\n\n“Upon my soul, there is nothing else but rugs in these French places!”\n the Captain rejoined, looking round Mrs. Vivian’s salon. “Which rug do\nyou mean?”\n\nMrs. Vivian had remarked to Blanche that it was very kind of her to come\nfirst, and Blanche declared that she could not have laid her head on her\npillow before she had seen her dear Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“Do you suppose I would wait because I am married?” she inquired, with\na keen little smile in her charming eyes. “I am not so much married as\nthat, I can tell you! Do you think I look much as if I were married,\nwith no one to bring me here to-night but Captain Lovelock?”\n\n“I am sure Captain Lovelock is a very gallant escort,” said Mrs. Vivian.\n\n“Oh, he was not afraid--that is, he was not afraid of the journey,\nthough it lay all through those dreadful wild Champs Elysees. But when\nwe arrived, he was afraid to come in--to come up here. Captain Lovelock\nis so modest, you know--in spite of all the success he had in America.\nHe will tell you about the success he had in America; it quite makes up\nfor the defeat of the British army in the Revolution. They were defeated\nin the Revolution, the British, were n’t they? I always told him so, but\nhe insists they were not. ‘How do we come to be free, then?’ I always\nask him; ‘I suppose you admit that we are free.’ Then he becomes\npersonal and says that I am free enough, certainly. But it ‘s the\ngeneral fact I mean; I wish you would tell him about the general fact. I\nthink he would believe you, because he knows you know a great deal about\nhistory and all that. I don’t mean this evening, but some time when\nit is convenient. He did n’t want to come in--he wanted to stay in the\ncarriage and smoke a cigar; he thought you would n’t like it, his coming\nwith me the first time. But I told him he need n’t mind that, for I\nwould certainly explain. I would be very careful to let you know that\nI brought him only as a substitute. A substitute for whom? A substitute\nfor my husband, of course. My dear Mrs. Vivian, of course I ought to\nbring you some pretty message from Gordon--that he is dying to come and\nsee you, only that he had nineteen letters to write and that he could\nn’t possibly stir from his fireside. I suppose a good wife ought to\ninvent excuses for her husband--ought to throw herself into the breach;\nis n’t that what they call it? But I am afraid I am not a good wife.\nDo you think I am a good wife, Mr. Longueville? You once stayed three\nmonths with us, and you had a chance to see. I don’t ask you that\nseriously, because you never tell the truth. I always do; so I will\nsay I am not a good wife. And then the breach is too big, and I am too\nlittle. Oh, I am too little, Mrs. Vivian; I know I am too little. I am\nthe smallest woman living; Gordon can scarcely see me with a microscope,\nand I believe he has the most powerful one in America. He is going to\nget another here; that is one of the things he came abroad for; perhaps\nit will do better. I do tell the truth, don’t I, Mrs. Vivian? I have\nthat merit, if I have n’t any other. You once told me so at Baden; you\nsaid you could say one thing for me, at any rate--that I did n’t tell\nfibs. You were very nice to me at Baden,” Blanche went on, with her\nlittle intent smile, laying her hand in that of her hostess. “You see,\nI have never forgotten it. So, to keep up my reputation, I must tell the\ntruth about Gordon. He simply said he would n’t come--voila! He gave no\nreason and he did n’t send you any pretty message. He simply declined,\nand he went out somewhere else. So you see he is n’t writing letters. I\ndon’t know where he can have gone; perhaps he has gone to the theatre.\nI know it is n’t proper to go to the theatre on Sunday evening; but\nthey say charity begins at home, and as Gordon’s does n’t begin at home,\nperhaps it does n’t begin anywhere. I told him that if he would n’t come\nwith me I would come alone, and he said I might do as I chose--that he\nwas not in a humor for making visits. I wanted to come to you very much;\nI had been thinking about it all day; and I am so fond of a visit like\nthis in the evening, without being invited. Then I thought perhaps you\nhad a salon--does n’t every one in Paris have a salon? I tried to have a\nsalon in New York, only Gordon said it would n’t do. He said it was n’t\nin our manners. Is this a salon to-night, Mrs. Vivian? Oh, do say it\nis; I should like so much to see Captain Lovelock in a salon! By good\nfortune he happened to have been dining with us; so I told him he must\nbring me here. I told you I would explain, Captain Lovelock,” she added,\n“and I hope you think I have made it clear.”\n\nThe Captain had turned very red during this wandering discourse. He sat\npulling his beard and shifting the position which, with his stalwart\nperson, he had taken up on a little gilded chair--a piece of furniture\nwhich every now and then gave a delicate creak.\n\n“I always understand you well enough till you begin to explain,” he\nrejoined, with a candid, even if embarrassed, laugh. “Then, by Jove,\nI ‘m quite in the woods. You see such a lot more in things than most\npeople. Does n’t she, Miss Vivian?”\n\n“Blanche has a fine imagination,” said Angela, smiling frankly at the\ncharming visitor.\n\nWhen Blanche was fairly adrift upon the current of her articulate\nreflections, it was the habit of her companions--indeed, it was a sort\nof tacit agreement among them--simply to make a circle and admire. They\nsat about and looked at her--yawning, perhaps, a little at times, but\non the whole very well entertained, and often exchanging a smiling\ncommentary with each other. She looked at them, smiled at them each,\nin succession. Every one had his turn, and this always helped to give\nBlanche an audience. Incoherent and aimless as much of her talk was, she\nnever looked prettier than in the attitude of improvisation--or rather,\nI should say, than in the hundred attitudes which she assumed at such a\ntime. Perpetually moving, she was yet constantly graceful, and while\nshe twisted her body and turned her head, with charming hands that never\nceased to gesticulate, and little, conscious, brilliant eyes that looked\neverywhere at once--eyes that seemed to chatter even faster than her\nlips--she made you forget the nonsense she poured forth, or think of it\nonly as a part of her personal picturesqueness. The thing was a regular\nperformance; the practice of unlimited chatter had made her perfect. She\nrested upon her audience and held it together, and the sight of half\na dozen pairs of amused and fascinated faces led her from one piece of\nfolly to another. On this occasion, her audience was far from failing\nher, for they were all greatly interested. Captain Lovelock’s interest,\nas we know, was chronic, and our three other friends were much occupied\nwith a matter with which Blanche was intimately connected. Bernard,\nas he listened to her, smiling mechanically, was not encouraged. He\nremembered what Mrs. Vivian had said shortly before she came in, and it\nwas not pleasant to him to think that Gordon had been occupied half\nthe day in contrasting the finest girl in the world with this magnified\nbutterfly. The contrast was sufficiently striking as Angela sat there\nnear her, very still, bending her handsome head a little, with her hands\ncrossed in her lap, and on her lips a kind but inscrutable smile. Mrs.\nVivian was on the sofa next to Blanche, one of whose hands, when it was\nnot otherwise occupied, she occasionally took into her own.\n\n“Dear little Blanche!” she softly murmured, at intervals.\n\nThese few remarks represent a longer pause than Mrs. Gordon often\nsuffered to occur. She continued to deliver herself upon a hundred\ntopics, and it hardly matters where we take her up.\n\n“I have n’t the least idea what we are going to do. I have nothing to\nsay about it whatever. Gordon tells me every day I must decide, and\nthen I ask Captain Lovelock what he thinks; because, you see, he always\nthinks a great deal. Captain Lovelock says he does n’t care a fig--that\nhe will go wherever I go. So you see that does n’t carry us very far.\nI want to settle on some place where Captain Lovelock won’t go, but he\nwon’t help me at all. I think it will look better for him not to follow\nus; don’t you think it will look better, Mrs. Vivian? Not that I care in\nthe least where we go--or whether Captain Lovelock follows us, either.\nI don’t take any interest in anything, Mrs. Vivian; don’t you think that\nis very sad? Gordon may go anywhere he likes--to St. Petersburg, or to\nBombay.”\n\n“You might go to a worse place than Bombay,” said Captain Lovelock,\nspeaking with the authority of an Anglo-Indian rich in reminiscences.\n\nBlanche gave him a little stare.\n\n“Ah well, that ‘s knocked on the head! From the way you speak of it, I\nthink you would come after us; and the more I think of that, the more\nI see it would n’t do. But we have got to go to some southern place,\nbecause I am very unwell. I have n’t the least idea what ‘s the matter\nwith me, and neither has any one else; but that does n’t make any\ndifference. It ‘s settled that I am out of health. One might as well\nbe out of it as in it, for all the advantage it is. If you are out of\nhealth, at any rate you can come abroad. It was Gordon’s discovery--he\n‘s always making discoveries. You see it ‘s because I ‘m so silly; he\ncan always put it down to my being an invalid. What I should like to do,\nMrs. Vivian, would be to spend the winter with you--just sitting on the\nsofa beside you and holding your hand. It would be rather tiresome for\nyou; but I really think it would be better for me than anything else.\nI have never forgotten how kind you were to me before my marriage--that\nsummer at Baden. You were everything to me--you and Captain Lovelock. I\nam sure I should be happy if I never went out of this lovely room. You\nhave got it so beautifully arranged--I mean to do my own room just like\nit when I go home. And you have got such lovely clothes. You never used\nto say anything about it, but you and Angela always had better clothes\nthan I. Are you always so quiet and serious--never talking about\nchiffons--always reading some wonderful book? I wish you would let\nme come and stay with you. If you only ask me, Gordon would be too\ndelighted. He would n’t have to trouble about me any more. He could go\nand live over in the Latin Quarter--that ‘s the desire of his heart--and\nthink of nothing but old bottles. I know it is n’t very good manners\nto beg for an invitation,” Blanche went on, smiling with a gentler\nradiance; “but when it ‘s a question of one’s health. One wants to keep\none’s self alive--does n’t one? One wants to keep one’s self going. It\nwould be so good for me, Mrs. Vivian; it would really be very good for\nme!”\n\nShe had turned round more and more to her hostess as she talked; and at\nlast she had given both her hands to Mrs. Vivian, and sat looking at her\nwith a singular mixture of earnestness and jocosity. It was hard to know\nwhether Blanche were expressing a real desire or a momentary caprice,\nand whether this abrupt little petition were to be taken seriously, or\ntreated merely as a dramatic pose in a series of more or less effective\nattitudes. Her smile had become almost a grimace, she was flushed, she\nshowed her pretty teeth; but there was a little passionate quiver in her\nvoice.\n\n“My dear child,” said Mrs. Vivian, “we should be delighted to have you\npay us a visit, and we should be so happy if we could do you any good.\nBut I am afraid you would very soon get tired of us, and I ought to tell\nyou, frankly, that our little home is to be--a broken up. You know there\nis to be a--a change,” the good lady continued, with a hesitation which\napparently came from a sense of walking on uncertain ground, while she\nglanced with a smile at Bernard and Angela.\n\nBlanche sat there with her little excited, yet innocent--too\ninnocent--stare; her eyes followed Mrs. Vivian’s. They met Bernard’s for\nan instant, and for some reason, at this moment, Bernard flushed.\n\nHe rose quickly and walked away to the window where he stood looking out\ninto the darkness. “The devil--the devil!” he murmured to himself; “she\ndoes n’t even know we are to be married--Gordon has n’t been able to\ntrust himself to tell her!” And this fact seemed pregnant with evidence\nas to Gordon’s state of mind; it did not appear to simplify the\nsituation. After a moment, while Bernard stood there with his back\nturned--he felt rather awkward and foolish--he heard Blanche begin with\nher little surprised voice.\n\n“Ah, you are going away? You are going to travel? But that ‘s charming;\nwe can travel together. You are not going to travel? What then are you\ngoing to do? You are going back to America? Ah, but you must n’t do\nthat, as soon as I come abroad; that ‘s not nice or friendly, Mrs.\nVivian, to your poor little old Blanche. You are not going back to\nAmerica? Ah, then, I give it up! What ‘s the great mystery? Is it\nsomething about Angela? There was always a mystery about Angela. I hope\nyou won’t mind my saying it, my dear; but I was always afraid of you.\nMy husband--he admires you so much, you know--has often tried to explain\nyou to me; but I have never understood. What are you going to do now?\nAre you going into a convent? Are you going to be--A-a-h!”\n\nAnd, suddenly, quickly, interrupting herself, Mrs. Gordon gave a long,\nwondering cry. Bernard heard her spring to her feet, and the two other\nladies rise from their seats. Captain Lovelock got up as well; Bernard\nheard him knock over his little gilded chair. There was a pause, during\nwhich Blanche went through a little mute exhibition of amazement and\npleasure. Bernard turned round, to receive half a dozen quick questions.\n\n“What are you hiding away for? What are you blushing for? I never saw\nyou do anything like that before! Why do you look so strange, and what\nare you making me say? Angela, is it true--is there something like\nthat?” Without waiting for the answer to this last question, Blanche\nthrew herself upon Mrs. Vivian. “My own Mrs. Vivian,” she cried, “is she\nmarried?”\n\n“My dear Blanche,” said Bernard, coming forward, “has not Gordon told\nyou? Angela and I are not married, but we hope to be before long. Gordon\nonly knew it this morning; we ourselves have only known it a short time.\nThere is no mystery about it, and we only want your congratulations.”\n\n“Well, I must say you have been very quiet about it!” cried Blanche.\n“When I was engaged, I wrote you all a letter.”\n\n“By Jove, she wrote to me!” observed Captain Lovelock.\n\nAngela went to her and kissed her.\n\n“Your husband does n’t seem to have explained me very successfully!”\n\nMrs. Gordon held Bernard’s intended for a moment at arm’s length, with\nboth her hands, looking at her with eyes of real excitement and wonder.\nThen she folded her in a prolonged, an exaggerated, embrace.\n\n“Why did n’t he tell me--why did n’t he tell me?” she presently began.\n“He has had all day to tell me, and it was very cruel of him to let\nme come here without knowing it. Could anything be more absurd--more\nawkward? You don’t think it ‘s awkward--you don’t mind it? Ah well, you\nare very good! But I like it, Angela--I like it extremely, immensely.\nI think it ‘s delightful, and I wonder it never occurred to me. Has\nit been going on long? Ah, of course, it has been going on! Did n’t it\nbegin at Baden, and did n’t I see it there? Do you mind my alluding to\nthat? At Baden we were all so mixed up that one could n’t tell who was\nattentive to whom! But Bernard has been very faithful, my dear; I can\nassure you of that. When he was in America he would n’t look at another\nwoman. I know something about that! He stayed three months in my house\nand he never spoke to me. Now I know why, Mr. Bernard; but you might\nhave told me at the time. The reason was certainly good enough. I always\nwant to know why, you know. Why Gordon never told me, for instance; that\n‘s what I want to know!”\n\nBlanche refused to sit down again; she declared that she was so agitated\nby this charming news that she could not be quiet, and that she must\npresently take her departure. Meanwhile she congratulated each of her\nfriends half a dozen times; she kissed Mrs. Vivian again, she almost\nkissed Bernard; she inquired about details; she longed to hear all\nabout Angela’s “things.” Of course they would stop for the wedding;\nbut meantime she must be very discreet; she must not intrude too\nmuch. Captain Lovelock addressed to Angela a few fragmentary, but\nwell-intentioned sentences, pulling his beard and fixing his eyes on the\ndoor-knob--an implement which presently turned in his manly fist, as he\nopened the door for his companion to withdraw. Blanche went away in a\nflutter of ejaculations and protestations which left our three friends\nin Mrs. Vivian’s little drawing-room standing looking at each other as\nthe door closed behind her.\n\n“It certainly would have been better taste in him to tell her,”\n said Bernard, frowning, “and not let other people see how little\ncommunication there is between them. It has mortified her.”\n\n“Poor Mr. Wright had his reasons,” Mrs. Vivian suggested, and then she\nventured to explain: “He still cares for Angela, and it was painful to\nhim to talk about her marrying some one else.”\n\nThis had been Bernard’s own reflection, and it was no more agreeable as\nMrs. Vivian presented it; though Angela herself seemed indifferent to\nit--seemed, indeed, not to hear it, as if she were thinking of something\nelse.\n\n“We must simply marry as soon as possible; to-morrow, if necessary,”\n said Bernard, with some causticity. “That ‘s the best thing we can do\nfor every one. When once Angela is married, Gordon will stop thinking\nof her. He will never permit his imagination to hover about a married\nwoman; I am very sure of that. He does n’t approve of that sort of\nthing, and he has the same law for himself as for other people.”\n\n“It does n’t matter,” said Angela, simply.\n\n“How do you mean, my daughter, it does n’t matter?”\n\n“I don’t feel obliged to feel so sorry for him now.”\n\n“Now? Pray, what has happened? I am more sorry than ever, since I have\nheard poor Blanche’s dreadful tone about him.”\n\nThe girl was silent a moment; then she shook her head, lightly.\n\n“Her tone--her tone? Dearest mother, don’t you see? She is intensely in\nlove with him!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThis observation struck Bernard as extremely ingenious and worthy of his\nmistress’s fine intelligence; he greeted it with enthusiasm, and thought\nof it for the next twelve hours. The more he thought of it the more\nfelicitous it seemed to him, and he went to Mrs. Vivian’s the next day\nalmost for the express purpose of saying to Angela that, decidedly,\nshe was right. He was admitted by his old friend, the little femme\nde chambre, who had long since bestowed upon him, definitively, her\nconfidence; and as in the ante-chamber he heard the voice of a gentleman\nraised and talking with some emphasis, come to him from the salon, he\npaused a moment, looking at her with an interrogative eye.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Vivian’s attendant, “I must tell Monsieur frankly that\nanother gentleman is there. Moreover, what does it matter? Monsieur\nwould perceive it for himself!”\n\n“Has he been here long?” asked Bernard.\n\n“A quarter of an hour. It probably does n’t seem long to the gentleman!”\n\n“Is he alone with Mademoiselle?”\n\n“He asked for Mademoiselle only. I introduced him into the salon, and\nMademoiselle, after conversing a little while with Madame, consented\nto receive him. They have been alone together, as I have told Monsieur,\nsince about three o’clock. Madame is in her own apartment. The position\nof Monsieur,” added this discriminating woman, “certainly justifies him\nin entering the salon.”\n\nBernard was quite of this opinion, and in a moment more he had crossed\nthe threshold of the little drawing-room and closed the door behind him.\n\nAngela sat there on a sofa, leaning back with her hands clasped in her\nlap and her eyes fixed upon Gordon Wright, who stood squarely before\nher, as if he had been making her a resolute speech. Her face wore a\nlook of distress, almost of alarm; she kept her place, but her eyes gave\nBernard a mute welcome. Gordon turned and looked at him slowly from head\nto foot. Bernard remembered, with a good deal of vividness, the last\nlook his friend had given him in the Champs Elysees the day before; and\nhe saw with some satisfaction that this was not exactly a repetition of\nthat expression of cold horror. It was a question, however, whether the\nhorror were changed for the better. Poor Gordon looked intensely sad and\ngrievously wronged. The keen resentment had faded from his face, but\nan immense reproach was there--a heavy, helpless, appealing reproach.\nBernard saw that he had not a scene of violence to dread--and yet, when\nhe perceived what was coming, he would almost have preferred violence.\nGordon did not offer him his hand, and before Bernard had had time to\nsay anything, began to speak again, as if he were going on with what he\nhad been saying to Angela.\n\n“You have done me a great wrong--you have done me a cruel wrong! I have\nbeen telling it to Miss Vivian; I came on purpose to tell her. I can’t\nreally tell her; I can’t tell her the details; it ‘s too painful! But\nyou know what I mean! I could n’t stand it any longer. I thought of\ngoing away--but I could n’t do that. I must come and say what I feel. I\ncan’t bear it now.”\n\nThis outbreak of a passionate sense of injury in a man habitually so\nundemonstrative, so little disposed to call attention to himself, had in\nit something at once of the touching and the terrible. Bernard, for an\ninstant, felt almost bewildered; he asked himself whether he had not,\nafter all, been a monster of duplicity. He was guilty of the weakness\nof taking refuge in what is called, I believe, in legal phrase, a\nside-issue.\n\n“Don’t say all this before Angela!” he exclaimed, with a kind of\nartificial energy. “You know she is not in the least at fault, and that\nit can only give her pain. The thing is between ourselves.”\n\nAngela was sitting there, looking up at both the men. “I like to hear\nit,” she said.\n\n“You have a singular taste!” Bernard declared.\n\n“I know it ‘s between ourselves,” cried Gordon, “and that Miss Vivian is\nnot at fault. She is only too lovely, too wise, too good! It is you\nand I that are at fault--horribly at fault! You see I admit it, and you\ndon’t. I never dreamed that I should live to say such things as this\nto you; but I never dreamed you would do what you have done! It ‘s\nhorrible, most horrible, that such a difference as this should come\nbetween two men who believed themselves--or whom I believed, at\nleast--the best friends in the world. For it is a difference--it ‘s a\ngreat gulf, and nothing will ever fill it up. I must say so; I can’t\nhelp it. You know I don’t express myself easily; so, if I break out this\nway, you may know what I feel. I know it is a pain to Miss Vivian, and\nI beg her to forgive me. She has so much to forgive that she can forgive\nthat, too. I can’t pretend to accept it; I can’t sit down and let it\npass. And then, it is n’t only my feelings; it ‘s the right; it ‘s the\njustice. I must say to her that you have no right to marry her; and beg\nof her to listen to me and let you go.”\n\n“My dear Gordon, are you crazy?” Bernard demanded, with an energy which,\nthis time at least, was sufficiently real.\n\n“Very likely I am crazy. I am crazy with disappointment and the\nbitterness of what I have lost. Add to that the wretchedness of what I\nhave found!”\n\n“Ah, don’t say that, Mr. Wright,” Angela begged.\n\nHe stood for an instant looking at her, but not heeding her words.\n“Will you listen to me again? Will you forget the wrong I did you?--my\nstupidity and folly and unworthiness? Will you blot out the past and let\nme begin again. I see you as clearly now as the light of that window.\nWill you give me another chance?”\n\nAngela turned away her eyes and covered her face with her hands. “You do\npain me!” she murmured.\n\n“You go too far,” said Bernard. “To what position does your\nextraordinary proposal relegate your wife?”\n\nGordon turned his pleading eyes on his old friend without a ray of\nconcession; but for a moment he hesitated. “Don’t speak to me of my\nwife. I have no wife.”\n\n“Ah, poor girl!” said Angela, springing up from the sofa.\n\n“I am perfectly serious,” Gordon went on, addressing himself again to\nher. “No, after all, I am not crazy; I see only too clearly--I see what\nshould be; when people see that, you call them crazy. Bernard has no\nright--he must give you up. If you really care for him, you should help\nhim. He is in a very false position; you should n’t wish to see him\nin such a position. I can’t explain to you--if it were even for my own\nsake. But Bernard must have told you; it is not possible that he has not\ntold you?”\n\n“I have told Angela everything, Gordon,” said Bernard.\n\n“I don’t know what you mean by your having done me a wrong!” the girl\nexclaimed.\n\n“If he has told you, then--I may say it! In listening to him, in\nbelieving him.”\n\n“But you did n’t believe me,” Bernard exclaimed, “since you immediately\nwent and offered yourself to Miss Vivian!”\n\n“I believed you all the same! When did I ever not believe you?”\n\n“The last words I ever heard from Mr. Wright were words of the deepest\nkindness,” said Angela.\n\nShe spoke with such a serious, tender grace, that Gordon seemed stirred\nto his depths again.\n\n“Ah, give me another chance!” he moaned.\n\nThe poor girl could not help her tone, and it was in the same tone that\nshe continued--\n\n“If you think so well of me, try and be reasonable.”\n\nGordon looked at her, slowly shaking his head.\n\n“Reasonable--reasonable? Yes, you have a right to say that, for you are\nfull of reason. But so am I. What I ask is within reasonable limits.”\n\n“Granting your happiness were lost,” said Bernard--“I say that only for\nthe argument--is that a ground for your wishing to deprive me of mine?”\n\n“It is not yours--it is mine, that you have taken! You put me off my\nguard, and then you took it! Yours is elsewhere, and you are welcome to\nit!”\n\n“Ah,” murmured Bernard, giving him a long look and turning away, “it is\nwell for you that I am willing still to regard you as my best friend!”\n\nGordon went on, more passionately, to Angela.\n\n“He put me off my guard--I can’t call it anything else. I know I gave\nhim a great chance--I encouraged him, urged him, tempted him. But when\nonce he had spoken, he should have stood to it. He should n’t have had\ntwo opinions--one for me, and one for himself! He put me off my guard.\nIt was because I still resisted him that I went to you again, that last\ntime. But I was still afraid of you, and in my heart I believed him. As\nI say, I always believed him; it was his great influence upon me. He is\nthe cleverest, the most intelligent, the most brilliant of men. I don’t\nthink that a grain less than I ever thought it,” he continued, turning\nagain to Bernard. “I think it only the more, and I don’t wonder that you\nfind a woman to believe it. But what have you done but deceive me? It\nwas just my belief in your intelligence that reassured me. When Miss\nVivian refused me a second time, and I left Baden, it was at first with\na sort of relief. But there came back a better feeling--a feeling faint\ncompared to this feeling of to-day, but strong enough to make me uneasy\nand to fill me with regret. To quench my regret, I kept thinking of what\nyou had said, and it kept me quiet. Your word had such weight with me!”\n\n“How many times more would you have wished to be refused, and how many\nrefusals would have been required to give me my liberty?” asked Bernard.\n\n“That question means nothing, because you never knew that I had again\noffered myself to Miss Vivian.”\n\n“No; you told me very little, considering all that you made me tell\nyou.”\n\n“I told you beforehand that I should do exactly as I chose.”\n\n“You should have allowed me the same liberty!”\n\n“Liberty!” cried Gordon. “Had n’t you liberty to range the whole world\nover? Could n’t he have found a thousand other women?”\n\n“It is not for me to think so,” said Angela, smiling a little.\n\nGordon looked at her a moment.\n\n“Ah, you cared for him from the first!” he cried.\n\n“I had seen him before I ever saw you,” said the girl.\n\nBernard suppressed an exclamation. There seemed to flash through these\nwords a sort of retrospective confession which told him something that\nshe had never directly told him. She blushed as soon as she had spoken,\nand Bernard found a beauty in this of which the brightness blinded him\nto the awkward aspect of the fact she had just presented to Gordon. At\nthis fact Gordon stood staring; then at last he apprehended it--largely.\n\n“Ah, then, it had been a plot between you!” he cried out.\n\nBernard and Angela exchanged a glance of pity.\n\n“We had met for five minutes, and had exchanged a few words before I\ncame to Baden. It was in Italy--at Siena. It was a simple accident that\nI never told you,” Bernard explained.\n\n“I wished that nothing should be said about it,” said Angela.\n\n“Ah, you loved him!” Gordon exclaimed.\n\nAngela turned away--she went to the window. Bernard followed her for\nthree seconds with his eyes; then he went on--\n\n“If it were so, I had no reason to suppose it. You have accused me of\ndeceiving you, but I deceived only myself. You say I put you off your\nguard, but you should rather say you put me on mine. It was, thanks to\nthat, that I fell into the most senseless, the most brutal of delusions.\nThe delusion passed away--it had contained the germ of better things.\nI saw my error, and I bitterly repented of it; and on the day you were\nmarried I felt free.”\n\n“Ah, yes, I have no doubt you waited for that!” cried Gordon. “It may\ninterest you to know that my marriage is a miserable failure.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear it--but I can’t help it.”\n\n“You have seen it with your own eyes. You know all about it, and I need\nn’t tell you.”\n\n“My dear Mr. Wright,” said Angela, pleadingly, turning round, “in\nHeaven’s name, don’t say that!”\n\n“Why should n’t I say it? I came here on purpose to say it. I came here\nwith an intention--with a plan. You know what Blanche is--you need n’t\npretend, for kindness to me, that you don’t. You know what a precious,\nwhat an inestimable wife she must make me--how devoted, how sympathetic\nshe must be, and what a household blessing at every hour of the day.\nBernard can tell you all about us--he has seen us in the sanctity of our\nhome.” Gordon gave a bitter laugh and went on, with the same strange,\nserious air of explaining his plan. “She despises me, she hates me, she\ncares no more for me than for the button on her glove--by which I mean\nthat she does n’t care a hundredth part as much. You may say that it\nserves me right, and that I have got what I deserve. I married her\nbecause she was silly. I wanted a silly wife; I had an idea you were too\nwise. Oh, yes, that ‘s what I thought of you! Blanche knew why I picked\nher out, and undertook to supply the article required. Heaven forgive\nher! She has certainly kept her engagement. But you can imagine how\nit must have made her like me--knowing why I picked her out! She has\ndisappointed me all the same. I thought she had a heart; but that was a\nmistake. It does n’t matter, though, because everything is over between\nus.”\n\n“What do you mean, everything is over?” Bernard demanded.\n\n“Everything will be over in a few weeks. Then I can speak to Miss Vivian\nseriously.”\n\n“Ah! I am glad to hear this is not serious,” said Bernard.\n\n“Miss Vivian, wait a few weeks,” Gordon went on. “Give me another chance\nthen. Then it will be perfectly right; I shall be free.”\n\n“You speak as if you were going to put an end to your wife!”\n\n“She is rapidly putting an end to herself. She means to leave me.”\n\n“Poor, unhappy man, do you know what you are saying?” Angela murmured.\n\n“Perfectly. I came here to say it. She means to leave me, and I mean to\noffer her every facility. She is dying to take a lover, and she has got\nan excellent one waiting for her. Bernard knows whom I mean; I don’t\nknow whether you do. She was ready to take one three months after our\nmarriage. It is really very good of her to have waited all this time;\nbut I don’t think she can go more than a week or two longer. She is\nrecommended a southern climate, and I am pretty sure that in the course\nof another ten days I may count upon their starting together for the\nshores of the Mediterranean. The shores of the Mediterranean, you know,\nare lovely, and I hope they will do her a world of good. As soon as they\nhave left Paris I will let you know; and then you will of course admit\nthat, virtually, I am free.”\n\n“I don’t understand you.”\n\n“I suppose you are aware,” said Gordon, “that we have the advantage of\nbeing natives of a country in which marriages may be legally dissolved.”\n\nAngela stared; then, softly--\n\n“Are you speaking of a divorce?”\n\n“I believe that is what they call it,” Gordon answered, gazing back at\nher with his densely clouded blue eyes. “The lawyers do it for you; and\nif she goes away with Lovelock, nothing will be more simple than for me\nto have it arranged.”\n\nAngela stared, I say; and Bernard was staring, too. Then the latter,\nturning away, broke out into a tremendous, irrepressible laugh.\n\nGordon looked at him a moment; then he said to Angela, with a deeper\ntremor in his voice--\n\n“He was my dearest friend.”\n\n“I never felt more devoted to you than at this moment!” Bernard\ndeclared, smiling still.\n\nGordon had fixed his sombre eyes upon the girl again.\n\n“Do you understand me now?”\n\nAngela looked back at him for some instants.\n\n“Yes,” she murmured at last.\n\n“And will you wait, and give me another chance?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, in the same tone.\n\nBernard uttered a quick exclamation, but Angela checked him with a\nglance, and Gordon looked from one of them to the other.\n\n“Can I trust you?” Gordon asked.\n\n“I will make you happy,” said Angela.\n\nBernard wondered what under the sun she meant; but he thought he might\nsafely add--\n\n“I will abide by her choice.”\n\nGordon actually began to smile.\n\n“It won’t be long, I think; two or three weeks.”\n\nAngela made no answer to this; she fixed her eyes on the floor.\n\n“I shall see Blanche as often as possible,” she presently said.\n\n“By all means! The more you see her the better you will understand me.”\n\n“I understand you very well now. But you have shaken me very much, and\nyou must leave me. I shall see you also--often.”\n\nGordon took up his hat and stick; he saw that Bernard did not do the\nsame.\n\n“And Bernard?” he exclaimed.\n\n“I shall ask him to leave Paris,” said Angela.\n\n“Will you go?”\n\n“I will do what Angela requests,” said Bernard.\n\n“You have heard what she requests; it ‘s for you to come now.”\n\n“Ah, you must at least allow me to take leave!” cried Bernard.\n\nGordon went to the door, and when he had opened it he stood for a while,\nholding it and looking at his companions. Then--\n\n“I assure you she won’t be long!” he said to Angela, and rapidly passed\nout.\n\nThe others stood silent till they heard the outer door of the apartment\nclose behind him.\n\n“And now please to elucidate!” said Bernard, folding his arms.\n\nAngela gave no answer for some moments; then she turned upon him a smile\nwhich appeared incongruous, but which her words presently helped to\nexplain.\n\n“He is intensely in love with his wife!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nThis statement was very effective, but it might well have seemed at\nfirst to do more credit to her satiric powers than to her faculty of\nobservation. This was the light in which it presented itself to Bernard;\nbut, little by little, as she amplified the text, he grew to think\nwell of it, and at last he was quite ready to place it, as a triumph of\nsagacity, on a level with that other discovery which she had made the\nevening before and with regard to which his especial errand to-day\nhad been to congratulate her afresh. It brought him, however, less\nsatisfaction than it appeared to bring to his clever companion; for,\nas he observed plausibly enough, Gordon was quite out of his head, and,\nthis being the case, of what importance was the secret of his heart?\n\n“The secret of his heart and the condition of his head are one and the\nsame thing,” said Angela. “He is turned upside down by the wretchedly\nfalse position that he has got into with his wife. She has treated him\nbadly, but he has treated her wrongly. They are in love with each other,\nand yet they both do nothing but hide it. He is not in the least in love\nwith poor me--not to-day any more than he was three years ago. He thinks\nhe is, because he is full of sorrow and bitterness, and because the news\nof our engagement has given him a shock. But that ‘s only a pretext--a\nchance to pour out the grief and pain which have been accumulating in\nhis heart under a sense of his estrangement from Blanche. He is too\nproud to attribute his feelings to that cause, even to himself; but he\nwanted to cry out and say he was hurt, to demand justice for a wrong;\nand the revelation of the state of things between you and me--which of\ncourse strikes him as incongruous; we must allow largely for that--came\nto him as a sudden opportunity. No, no,” the girl went on, with a\ngenerous ardor in her face, following further the train of her argument,\nwhich she appeared to find extremely attractive, “I know what you\nare going to say and I deny it. I am not fanciful, or sophistical, or\nirrational, and I know perfectly what I am about. Men are so stupid; it\n‘s only women that have real discernment. Leave me alone, and I shall do\nsomething. Blanche is silly, yes, very silly; but she is not so bad as\nher husband accused her of being, in those dreadful words which he\nwill live to repent of. She is wise enough to care for him, greatly, at\nbottom, and to feel her little heart filled with rage and shame that\nhe does n’t appear to care for her. If he would take her a little\nmore seriously--it ‘s an immense pity he married her because she was\nsilly!--she would be flattered by it, and she would try and deserve it.\nNo, no, no! she does n’t, in reality, care a straw for Captain Lovelock,\nI assure you, I promise you she does n’t. A woman can tell. She is in\ndanger, possibly, and if her present situation, as regards her husband,\nlasts, she might do something as horrid as he said. But she would do\nit out of spite--not out of affection for the Captain, who must be got\nimmediately out of the way. She only keeps him to torment her husband\nand make Gordon come back to her. She would drop him forever to-morrow.”\n Angela paused a moment, reflecting, with a kindled eye. “And she shall!”\n\nBernard looked incredulous.\n\n“How will that be, Miss Solomon?”\n\n“You shall see when you come back.”\n\n“When I come back? Pray, where am I going?”\n\n“You will leave Paris for a fortnight--as I promised our poor friend.”\n\nBernard gave an irate laugh.\n\n“My dear girl, you are ridiculous! Your promising it was almost as\nchildish as his asking it.”\n\n“To play with a child you must be childish. Just see the effect of this\nabominable passion of love, which you have been crying up to me so! By\nits operation Gordon Wright, the most sensible man of our acquaintance,\nis reduced to the level of infancy! If you will only go away, I will\nmanage him.”\n\n“You certainly manage me! Pray, where shall I go?”\n\n“Wherever you choose. I will write to you every day.”\n\n“That will be an inducement,” said Bernard. “You know I have never\nreceived a letter from you.”\n\n“I write the most delightful ones!” Angela exclaimed; and she succeeded\nin making him promise to start that night for London.\n\nShe had just done so when Mrs. Vivian presented herself, and the good\nlady was not a little astonished at being informed of his intention.\n\n“You surely are not going to give up my daughter to oblige Mr. Wright?”\n she observed.\n\n“Upon my word, I feel as if I were!” said Bernard.\n\n“I will explain it, dear mamma,” said Angela. “It is very interesting.\nMr. Wright has made a most fearful scene; the state of things between\nhim and Blanche is dreadful.”\n\nMrs. Vivian opened her clear eyes.\n\n“You really speak as if you liked it!”\n\n“She does like it--she told Gordon so,” said Bernard. “I don’t know what\nshe is up to! Gordon has taken leave of his wits; he wishes to put away\nhis wife.”\n\n“To put her away?”\n\n“To repudiate her, as the historians say!”\n\n“To repudiate little Blanche!” murmured Mrs. Vivian, as if she were\nstruck with the incongruity of the operation.\n\n“I mean to keep them together,” said Angela, with a firm decision.\n\nHer mother looked at her with admiration.\n\n“My dear daughter, I will assist you.”\n\nThe two ladies had such an air of mysterious competence to the task they\nhad undertaken that it seemed to Bernard that nothing was left to him\nbut to retire into temporary exile. He accordingly betook himself to\nLondon, where he had social resources which would, perhaps, make exile\nendurable. He found himself, however, little disposed to avail himself\nof these resources, and he treated himself to no pleasures but those of\nmemory and expectation. He ached with a sense of his absence from Mrs.\nVivian’s deeply familiar sky-parlor, which seemed to him for the time\nthe most sacred spot on earth--if on earth it could be called--and he\nconsigned to those generous postal receptacles which ornament with their\nbrilliant hue the London street-corners, an inordinate number of the\nmost voluminous epistles that had ever been dropped into them. He took\nlong walks, alone, and thought all the way of Angela, to whom, it seemed\nto him, that the character of ministering angel was extremely becoming.\nShe was faithful to her promise of writing to him every day, and she was\nan angel who wielded--so at least Bernard thought, and he was particular\nabout letters--a very ingenious pen. Of course she had only one\ntopic--the success of her operations with regard to Gordon. “Mamma has\nundertaken Blanche,” she wrote, “and I am devoting myself to Mr. W. It\nis really very interesting.” She told Bernard all about it in detail,\nand he also found it interesting; doubly so, indeed, for it must be\nconfessed that the charming figure of the mistress of his affections\nattempting to heal a great social breach with her light and delicate\nhands, divided his attention pretty equally with the distracted, the\ndistorted, the almost ludicrous, image of his old friend.\n\nAngela wrote that Gordon had come back to see her the day after his\nfirst visit, and had seemed greatly troubled on learning that Bernard\nhad taken himself off. “It was because you insisted on it, of course,”\n he said; “it was not from feeling the justice of it himself.” “I told\nhim,” said Angela, in her letter, “that I had made a point of it, but\nthat we certainly ought to give you a little credit for it. But I could\nn’t insist upon this, for fear of sounding a wrong note and exciting\nafresh what I suppose he would be pleased to term his jealousy. He asked\nme where you had gone, and when I told him--‘Ah, how he must hate me!’\nhe exclaimed. ‘There you are quite wrong,’ I answered. ‘He feels as\nkindly to you as--as I do.’ He looked as if he by no means believed\nthis; but, indeed, he looks as if he believed nothing at all. He is\nquite upset and demoralized. He stayed half an hour and paid me his\nvisit--trying hard to ‘please’ me again! Poor man, he is in a charming\nstate to please the fair sex! But if he does n’t please me, he interests\nme more and more; I make bold to say that to you. You would have said\nit would be very awkward; but, strangely enough, I found it very easy. I\nsuppose it is because I am so interested. Very likely it was awkward for\nhim, poor fellow, for I can certify that he was not a whit happier at\nthe end of his half-hour, in spite of the privilege he had enjoyed. He\nsaid nothing more about you, and we talked of Paris and New York,\nof Baden and Rome. Imagine the situation! I shall make no resistance\nwhatever to it; I shall simply let him perceive that conversing with me\non these topics does not make him feel a bit more comfortable, and that\nhe must look elsewhere for a remedy. I said not a word about Blanche.”\n\nShe spoke of Blanche, however, the next time. “He came again this\nafternoon,” she said in her second letter, “and he wore exactly the same\nface as yesterday--namely, a very unhappy one. If I were not entirely\ntoo wise to believe his account of himself, I might suppose that he was\nunhappy because Blanche shows symptoms of not taking flight. She has\nbeen with us a great deal--she has no idea what is going on--and I can’t\nhonestly say that she chatters any less than usual. But she is greatly\ninterested in certain shops that she is buying out, and especially in\nher visits to her tailor. Mamma has proposed to her--in view of your\nabsence--to come and stay with us, and she does n’t seem afraid of the\nidea. I told her husband to-day that we had asked her, and that we\nhoped he had no objection. ‘None whatever; but she won’t come.’ ‘On\nthe contrary, she says she will.’ ‘She will pretend to, up to the last\nminute; and then she will find a pretext for backing out.’ ‘Decidedly,\nyou think very ill of her,’ I said. ‘She hates me,’ he answered, looking\nat me strangely. ‘You say that of every one,’ I said. ‘Yesterday you\nsaid it of Bernard.’ ‘Ah, for him there would be more reason!’ he\nexclaimed. ‘I won’t attempt to answer for Bernard,’ I went on, ‘but\nI will answer for Blanche. Your idea of her hating you is a miserable\ndelusion. She cares for you more than for any one in the world. You only\nmisunderstand each other, and with a little good will on both sides you\ncan easily get out of your tangle.’ But he would n’t listen to me; he\nstopped me short. I saw I should excite him if I insisted; so I dropped\nthe subject. But it is not for long; he shall listen to me.”\n\nLater she wrote that Blanche had in fact “backed out,” and would\nnot come to stay with them, having given as an excuse that she was\nperpetually trying on dresses, and that at Mrs. Vivian’s she should be\nat an inconvenient distance from the temple of these sacred rites, and\nthe high priest who conducted the worship. “But we see her every day,”\n said Angela, “and mamma is constantly with her. She likes mamma better\nthan me. Mamma listens to her a great deal and talks to her a little--I\ncan’t do either when we are alone. I don’t know what she says--I mean\nwhat mamma says; what Blanche says I know as well as if I heard it. We\nsee nothing of Captain Lovelock, and mamma tells me she has not spoken\nof him for two days. She thinks this is a better symptom, but I am\nnot so sure. Poor Mr. Wright treats it as a great triumph that Blanche\nshould behave as he foretold. He is welcome to the comfort he can get\nout of this, for he certainly gets none from anything else. The society\nof your correspondent is not that balm to his spirit which he appeared\nto expect, and this in spite of the fact that I have been as gentle and\nkind with him as I know how to be. He is very silent--he sometimes\nsits for ten minutes without speaking; I assure you it is n’t amusing.\nSometimes he looks at me as if he were going to break out with that\ncrazy idea to which he treated me the other day. But he says nothing,\nand then I see that he is not thinking of me--he is simply thinking of\nBlanche. The more he thinks of her the better.”\n\n“My dear Bernard,” she began on another occasion, “I hope you are not\ndying of ennui, etc. Over here things are going so-so. He asked me\nyesterday to go with him to the Louvre, and we walked about among the\npictures for half an hour. Mamma thinks it a very strange sort of thing\nfor me to be doing, and though she delights, of all things, in a good\ncause, she is not sure that this cause is good enough to justify the\nmeans. I admit that the means are very singular, and, as far as the\nLouvre is concerned, they were not successful. We sat and looked for a\nquarter of an hour at the great Venus who has lost her arms, and he said\nnever a word. I think he does n’t know what to say. Before we separated\nhe asked me if I heard from you. ‘Oh, yes,’ I said, ‘every day.’\n‘And does he speak of me?’ ‘Never!’ I answered; and I think he looked\ndisappointed.” Bernard had, in fact, in writing to Angela, scarcely\nmentioned his name. “He had not been here for two days,” she continued,\nat the end of a week; “but last evening, very late--too late for a\nvisitor--he came in. Mamma had left the drawing-room, and I was sitting\nalone; I immediately saw that we had reached a crisis. I thought\nat first he was going to tell me that Blanche had carried out his\nprediction; but I presently saw that this was not where the shoe\npinched; and, besides, I knew that mamma was watching her too closely.\n‘How can I have ever been such a dull-souled idiot?’ he broke out, as\nsoon as he had got into the room. ‘I like to hear you say that,’ I said,\n‘because it does n’t seem to me that you have been at all wise.’ ‘You\nare cleverness, kindness, tact, in the most perfect form!’ he went on.\nAs a veracious historian I am bound to tell you that he paid me a bushel\nof compliments, and thanked me in the most flattering terms for my\nhaving let him bore me so for a week. ‘You have not bored me,’ I\nsaid; ‘you have interested me.’ ‘Yes,’ he cried, ‘as a curious case of\nmonomania. It ‘s a part of your kindness to say that; but I know I have\nbored you to death; and the end of it all is that you despise me. You\ncan’t help despising me; I despise myself. I used to think that I was a\nman, but I have given that up; I am a poor creature! I used to think I\ncould take things quietly and bear them bravely. But I can’t! If it were\nnot for very shame I could sit here and cry to you.’ ‘Don’t mind me,’\nI said; ‘you know it is a part of our agreement that I was not to\nbe critical.’ ‘Our agreement?’ he repeated, vaguely. ‘I see you have\nforgotten it,’ I answered; ‘but it does n’t in the least matter; it is\nnot of that I wish to talk to you. All the more that it has n’t done you\na particle of good. I have been extremely nice with you for a week;\nbut you are just as unhappy now as you were at the beginning. Indeed, I\nthink you are rather worse.’ ‘Heaven forgive me, Miss Vivian, I believe\nI am!’ he cried. ‘Heaven will easily forgive you; you are on the wrong\nroad. To catch up with your happiness, which has been running away from\nyou, you must take another; you must travel in the same direction as\nBlanche; you must not separate yourself from your wife.’ At the sound of\nBlanche’s name he jumped up and took his usual tone; he knew all about\nhis wife, and needed no information. But I made him sit down again, and\nI made him listen to me. I made him listen for half an hour, and at the\nend of the time he was interested. He had all the appearance of it; he\nsat gazing at me, and at last the tears came into his eyes. I believe I\nhad a moment of eloquence. I don’t know what I said, nor how I said it,\nto what point it would bear examination, nor how, if you had been there,\nit would seem to you, as a disinterested critic, to hang together; but\nI know that after a while there were tears in my own eyes. I begged him\nnot to give up Blanche; I assured him that she is not so foolish as she\nseems; that she is a very delicate little creature to handle, and that,\nin reality, whatever she does, she is thinking only of him. He had been\nall goodness and kindness to her, I knew that; but he had not, from the\nfirst, been able to conceal from her that he regarded her chiefly as a\npretty kitten. She wished to be more than that, and she took refuge in\nflirting, simply to excite his jealousy and make him feel strongly\nabout her. He has felt strongly, and he was feeling strongly now; he was\nfeeling passionately--that was my whole contention. But he had perhaps\nnever made it plain to those rather near-sighted little mental eyes of\nhers, and he had let her suppose something that could n’t fail to rankle\nin her mind and torment it. ‘You have let her suppose,’ I said, ‘that\nyou were thinking of me, and the poor girl has been jealous of me. I\nknow it, but from nothing she herself has said. She has said nothing;\nshe has been too proud and too considerate. If you don’t think that ‘s\nto her honor, I do. She has had a chance every day for a week, but she\nhas treated me without a grain of spite. I have appreciated it, I have\nunderstood it, and it has touched me very much. It ought to touch you,\nMr. Wright. When she heard I was engaged to Mr. Longueville, it gave her\nan immense relief. And yet, at the same moment you were protesting, and\ndenouncing, and saying those horrible things about her! I know how she\nappears--she likes admiration. But the admiration in the world which she\nwould most delight in just now would be yours. She plays with Captain\nLovelock as a child does with a wooden harlequin, she pulls a string\nand he throws up his arms and legs. She has about as much intention\nof eloping with him as a little girl might have of eloping with a\npasteboard Jim Crow. If you were to have a frank explanation with her,\nBlanche would very soon throw Jim Crow out of the window. I very humbly\nentreat you to cease thinking of me. I don’t know what wrong you have\never done me, or what kindness I have ever done you, that you should\nfeel obliged to trouble your head about me. You see all I am--I tell you\nnow. I am nothing in the least remarkable. As for your thinking ill of\nme at Baden, I never knew it nor cared about it. If it had been so, you\nsee how I should have got over it. Dear Mr. Wright, we might be such\ngood friends, if you would only believe me. She ‘s so pretty, so\ncharming, so universally admired. You said just now you had bored me,\nbut it ‘s nothing--in spite of all the compliments you have paid me--to\nthe way I have bored you. If she could only know it--that I have bored\nyou! Let her see for half an hour that I am out of your mind--the rest\nwill take care of itself. She might so easily have made a quarrel with\nme. The way she has behaved to me is one of the prettiest things I have\never seen, and you shall see the way I shall always behave to her! Don’t\nthink it necessary to say out of politeness that I have not bored you;\nit is not in the least necessary. You know perfectly well that you are\ndisappointed in the charm of my society. And I have done my best, too.\nI can honestly affirm that!’ For some time he said nothing, and then he\nremarked that I was very clever, but he did n’t see a word of sense\nin what I said. ‘It only proves,’ I said, ‘that the merit of my\nconversation is smaller than you had taken it into your head to fancy.\nBut I have done you good, all the same. Don’t contradict me; you don’t\nknow yet; and it ‘s too late for us to argue about it. You will tell me\nto-morrow.’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nSome three evenings after he received this last report of the progress\nof affairs in Paris, Bernard, upon whom the burden of exile sat none the\nmore lightly as the days went on, turned out of the Strand into one of\nthe theatres. He had been gloomily pushing his way through the various\nLondon densities--the November fog, the nocturnal darkness, the jostling\ncrowd. He was too restless to do anything but walk, and he had been\nsaying to himself, for the thousandth time, that if he had been guilty\nof a misdemeanor in succumbing to the attractions of the admirable girl\nwho showed to such advantage in letters of twelve pages, his fault was\nrichly expiated by these days of impatience and bereavement. He gave\nlittle heed to the play; his thoughts were elsewhere, and, while they\nrambled, his eyes wandered round the house. Suddenly, on the other\nside of it, he beheld Captain Lovelock, seated squarely in his\norchestra-stall, but, if Bernard was not mistaken, paying as little\nattention to the stage as he himself had done. The Captain’s eyes, it\nis true, were fixed upon the scene; his head was bent a little, his\nmagnificent beard rippled over the expanse of his shirt-front. But\nBernard was not slow to see that his gaze was heavy and opaque, and\nthat, though he was staring at the actresses, their charms were lost\nupon him. He saw that, like himself, poor Lovelock had matter for\nreflection in his manly breast, and he concluded that Blanche’s\nponderous swain was also suffering from a sense of disjunction. Lovelock\nsat in the same posture all the evening, and that his imagination had\nnot projected itself into the play was proved by the fact that during\nthe entractes he gazed with the same dull fixedness at the curtain.\nBernard forebore to interrupt him; we know that he was not at this\nmoment socially inclined, and he judged that the Captain was as little\nso, inasmuch as causes even more imperious than those which had operated\nin his own case must have been at the bottom of his sudden appearance in\nLondon. On leaving the theatre, however, Bernard found himself detained\nwith the crowd in the vestibule near the door, which, wide open to the\nstreet, was a scene of agitation and confusion. It had come on to rain,\nand the raw dampness mingled itself with the dusky uproar of the Strand.\nAt last, among the press of people, as he was passing out, our hero\nbecame aware that he had been brought into contact with Lovelock,\nwho was walking just beside him. At the same moment Lovelock noticed\nhim--looked at him for an instant, and then looked away. But he\nlooked back again the next instant, and the two men then uttered that\ninarticulate and inexpressive exclamation which passes for a sign of\ngreeting among gentlemen of the Anglo-Saxon race, in their moments of\nmore acute self-consciousness.\n\n“Oh, are you here?” said Bernard. “I thought you were in Paris.”\n\n“No; I ain’t in Paris,” Lovelock answered with some dryness. “Tired of\nthe beastly hole!”\n\n“Oh, I see,” said Bernard. “Excuse me while I put up my umbrella.”\n\nHe put up his umbrella, and from under it, the next moment, he saw the\nCaptain waving two fingers at him out of the front of a hansom. When\nhe returned to his hotel he found on his table a letter superscribed in\nGordon Wright’s hand. This communication ran as follows:\n\n“I believe you are making a fool of me. In Heaven’s name, come back to\nParis! G. W.”\n\nBernard hardly knew whether to regard these few words as a further\ndeclaration of war, or as an overture to peace; but he lost no time in\ncomplying with the summons they conveyed. He started for Paris the\nnext morning, and in the evening, after he had removed the dust of his\njourney and swallowed a hasty dinner, he rang at Mrs. Vivian’s door.\nThis lady and her daughter gave him a welcome which--I will not say\nsatisfied him, but which, at least, did something toward soothing the\nstill unhealed wounds of separation.\n\n“And what is the news of Gordon?” he presently asked.\n\n“We have not seen him in three days,” said Angela.\n\n“He is cured, dear Bernard; he must be. Angela has been wonderful,” Mrs.\nVivian declared.\n\n“You should have seen mamma with Blanche,” her daughter said, smiling.\n“It was most remarkable.”\n\nMrs. Vivian smiled, too, very gently.\n\n“Dear little Blanche! Captain Lovelock has gone to London.”\n\n“Yes, he thinks it a beastly hole. Ah, no,” Bernard added, “I have got\nit wrong.”\n\nBut it little mattered. Late that night, on his return to his own rooms,\nBernard sat gazing at his fire. He had not begun to undress; he was\nthinking of a good many things. He was in the midst of his reflections\nwhen there came a rap at his door, which the next moment was flung open.\nGordon Wright stood there, looking at him--with a gaze which Bernard\nreturned for a moment before bidding him to come in. Gordon came in and\ncame up to him; then he held out his hand. Bernard took it with great\nsatisfaction; his last feeling had been that he was very weary of this\nridiculous quarrel, and it was an extreme relief to find it was over.\n\n“It was very good of you to go to London,” said Gordon, looking at him\nwith all the old serious honesty of his eyes.\n\n“I have always tried to do what I could to oblige you,” Bernard\nanswered, smiling.\n\n“You must have cursed me over there,” Gordon went on.\n\n“I did, a little. As you were cursing me here, it was permissible.”\n\n“That ‘s over now,” said Gordon. “I came to welcome you back. It seemed\nto me I could n’t lay my head on my pillow without speaking to you.”\n\n“I am glad to get back,” Bernard admitted, smiling still. “I can’t\ndeny that. And I find you as I believed I should.” Then he added,\nseriously--“I knew Angela would keep us good friends.”\n\nFor a moment Gordon said nothing. Then, at last--\n\n“Yes, for that purpose it did n’t matter which of us should marry her.\nIf it had been I,” he added, “she would have made you accept it.”\n\n“Ah, I don’t know!” Bernard exclaimed.\n\n“I am sure of it,” said Gordon earnestly--almost argumentatively. “She\n‘s an extraordinary woman.”\n\n“Keeping you good friends with me--that ‘s a great thing. But it ‘s\nnothing to her keeping you good friends with your wife.”\n\nGordon looked at Bernard for an instant; then he fixed his eyes for some\ntime on the fire.\n\n“Yes, that is the greatest of all things. A man should value his\nwife. He should believe in her. He has taken her, and he should keep\nher--especially when there is a great deal of good in her. I was a great\nfool the other day,” he went on. “I don’t remember what I said. It was\nvery weak.”\n\n“It seemed to me feeble,” said Bernard. “But it is quite within a man’s\nrights to be a fool once in a while, and you had never abused of the\nlicense.”\n\n“Well, I have done it for a lifetime--for a lifetime.” And Gordon took\nup his hat. He looked into the crown of it for a moment, and then he\nfixed his eyes on Bernard’s again. “But there is one thing I hope you\nwon’t mind my saying. I have come back to my old impression of Miss\nVivian.”\n\n“Your old impression?”\n\nAnd Miss Vivian’s accepted lover frowned a little.\n\n“I mean that she ‘s not simple. She ‘s very strange.”\n\nBernard’s frown cleared away in a sudden, almost eager smile.\n\n“Say at once that you dislike her! That will do capitally.”\n\nGordon shook his head, and he, too, almost smiled a little.\n\n“It ‘s not true. She ‘s very wonderful. And if I did dislike her, I\nshould struggle with it. It would never do for me to dislike your wife!”\n\nAfter he had gone, when the night was half over, Bernard, lying awake\na while, gave a laugh in the still darkness, as this last sentence came\nback to him.\n\nOn the morrow he saw Blanche, for he went to see Gordon. The latter, at\nfirst, was not at home; but he had a quarter of an hour’s talk with his\nwife, whose powers of conversation were apparently not in the smallest\ndegree affected by anything that had occurred.\n\n“I hope you enjoyed your visit to London,” she said. “Did you go to buy\nAngela a set of diamonds in Bond Street? You did n’t buy anything--you\ndid n’t go into a shop? Then pray what did you go for? Excuse my\ncuriosity--it seems to me it ‘s rather flattering. I never know anything\nunless I am told. I have n’t any powers of observation. I noticed you\nwent--oh, yes, I observed that very much; and I thought it very strange,\nunder the circumstances. Your most intimate friend arrived in Paris, and\nyou choose the next day to make a little tour! I don’t like to see you\ntreat my husband so; he would never have done it to you. And if you did\nn’t stay for Gordon, you might have staid for Angela. I never heard of\nanything so monstrous as a gentleman rushing away from the object of his\naffection, for no particular purpose that any one could discover, the\nday after she has accepted him. It was not the day after? Well, it was\ntoo soon, at any rate. Angela could n’t in the least tell me what\nyou had gone for; she said it was for a ‘change.’ That was a charming\nreason! But she was very much ashamed of you--and so was I; and at last\nwe all sent Captain Lovelock after you to bring you back. You came back\nwithout him? Ah, so much the better; I suppose he is still looking for\nyou, and, as he is n’t very clever, that will occupy him for some time.\nWe want to occupy him; we don’t approve of his being so idle. However,\nfor my own part, I am very glad you were away. I was a great deal at\nMrs. Vivian’s, and I should n’t have felt nearly so much at liberty\nto go if I had known I should always find you there making love to\nMademoiselle. It would n’t have seemed to me discreet,--I know what you\nare going to say--that it ‘s the first time you ever heard of my wishing\nto avoid an indiscretion. It ‘s a taste I have taken up lately,--for the\nsame reason you went to London, for a ‘change.’” Here Blanche paused\nfor an appreciable moment; and then she added--“Well, I must say, I have\nnever seen anything so lovely as Mrs. Vivian’s influence. I hope mamma\nwon’t be disappointed in it this time.”\n\nWhen Bernard next saw the other two ladies, he said to them that he\nwas surprised at the way in which clever women incurred moral\nresponsibilities.\n\n“We like them,” said Mrs. Vivian. “We delight in them!”\n\n“Well,” said Bernard, “I would n’t for the world have it on my\nconscience to have reconciled poor Gordon to Mrs. Blanche.”\n\n“You are not to say a word against Blanche,” Angela declared. “She ‘s a\nlittle miracle.”\n\n“It will be all right, dear Bernard,” Mrs. Vivian added, with soft\nauthority.\n\n“I have taken a great fancy to her,” the younger lady went on.\n\nBernard gave a little laugh.\n\n“Gordon is right in his ultimate opinion. You are very strange!”\n\n“You may abuse me as much as you please; but I will never hear a word\nagainst Mrs. Gordon.”\n\nAnd she never would in future; though it is not recorded that Bernard\navailed himself in any special degree of the license offered him in\nconjunction with this warning.\n\nBlanche’s health within a few days had, according to her own account,\ntaken a marvellous turn for the better; but her husband appeared still\nto think it proper that they should spend the winter beneath a brilliant\nsun, and he presently informed his friends that they had at last settled\nit between them that a voyage up the Nile must be, for a thoroughly\nunited couple, a very agreeable pastime. To perform this expedition\nadvantageously they must repair to Cairo without delay, and for this\nreason he was sure that Bernard and Angela would easily understand their\nnot making a point of waiting for the wedding. These happy people\nquite understood it. Their nuptials were to be celebrated with extreme\nsimplicity. If, however, Gordon was not able to be present, he, in\nconjunction with his wife, bought for Angela, as a bridal gift, a\nnecklace of the most beautiful pearls the Rue de la Paix could furnish;\nand on his arrival at Cairo, while he waited for his dragoman to give\nthe signal for starting, he found time, in spite of the exactions of\nthat large correspondence which has been more than once mentioned in the\ncourse of our narrative, to write Bernard the longest letter he had\never addressed to him. The letter reached Bernard in the middle of his\nhoneymoon."
