A certain\nthread of meaning binds them.  Memories of childhood and youth, portraits\nof those who have gone before us in the battle—taken together, they build\nup a face that “I have loved long since and lost awhile,” the face of\nwhat was once myself.  This has come by accident; I had no design at\nfirst to be autobiographical; I was but led away by the charm of beloved\nmemories and by regret for the irrevocable dead; and when my own young\nface (which is a face of the dead also) began to appear in the well as by\na kind of magic, I was the first to be surprised at the occurrence.\n\nMy grandfather the pious child, my father the idle eager sentimental\nyouth, I have thus unconsciously exposed.  Of their descendant, the\nperson of to-day, I wish to keep the secret: not because I love him\nbetter, but because, with him, I am still in a business partnership, and\ncannot divide interests.\n\nOf the papers which make up the volume, some have appeared already in\n_The Cornhill_, _Longman’s_, _Scribner_, _The English Illustrated_, _The\nMagazine of Art_, _The Contemporary Review_; three are here in print for\nthe first time; and two others have enjoyed only what may he regarded as\na private circulation.\n\n                                                                   R.

THE FOREIGNER AT HOME\n\n\n    “This is no my ain house;\n    I ken by the biggin’ o’t.”\n\nTwo recent books {1} one by Mr. Grant White on England, one on France by\nthe diabolically clever Mr. Hillebrand, may well have set people thinking\non the divisions of races and nations.  Such thoughts should arise with\nparticular congruity and force to inhabitants of that United Kingdom,\npeopled from so many different stocks, babbling so many different\ndialects, and offering in its extent such singular contrasts, from the\nbusiest over-population to the unkindliest desert, from the Black Country\nto the Moor of Rannoch.  It is not only when we cross the seas that we go\nabroad; there are foreign parts of England; and the race that has\nconquered so wide an empire has not yet managed to assimilate the islands\nwhence she sprang.  Ireland, Wales, and the Scottish mountains still\ncling, in part, to their old Gaelic speech.  It was but the other day\nthat English triumphed in Cornwall, and they still show in Mousehole, on\nSt. Michael’s Bay, the house of the last Cornish-speaking woman.  English\nitself, which will now frank the traveller through the most of North\nAmerica, through the greater South Sea Islands, in India, along much of\nthe coast of Africa, and in the ports of China and Japan, is still to be\nheard, in its home country, in half a hundred varying stages of\ntransition.  You may go all over the States, and—setting aside the actual\nintrusion and influence of foreigners, negro, French, or Chinese—you\nshall scarce meet with so marked a difference of accent as in the forty\nmiles between Edinburgh and Glasgow, or of dialect as in the hundred\nmiles between Edinburgh and Aberdeen.  Book English has gone round the\nworld, but at home we still preserve the racy idioms of our fathers, and\nevery county, in some parts every dale, has its own quality of speech,\nvocal or verbal.  In like manner, local custom and prejudice, even local\nreligion and local law, linger on into the latter end of the nineteenth\ncentury—_imperia in imperio_, foreign things at home.\n\nIn spite of these promptings to reflection, ignorance of his neighbours\nis the character of the typical John Bull.  His is a domineering nature,\nsteady in fight, imperious to command, but neither curious nor quick\nabout the life of others.  In French colonies, and still more in the\nDutch, I have read that there is an immediate and lively contact between\nthe dominant and the dominated race, that a certain sympathy is begotten,\nor at the least a transfusion of prejudices, making life easier for both.\nBut the Englishman sits apart, bursting with pride and ignorance.  He\nfigures among his vassals in the hour of peace with the same disdainful\nair that led him on to victory.  A passing enthusiasm for some foreign\nart or fashion may deceive the world, it cannot impose upon his\nintimates.  He may be amused by a foreigner as by a monkey, but he will\nnever condescend to study him with any patience.  Miss Bird, an authoress\nwith whom I profess myself in love, declares all the viands of Japan to\nbe uneatable—a staggering pretension.  So, when the Prince of Wales’s\nmarriage was celebrated at Mentone by a dinner to the Mentonese, it was\nproposed to give them solid English fare—roast beef and plum pudding, and\nno tomfoolery.  Here we have either pole of the Britannic folly.  We will\nnot eat the food of any foreigner; nor, when we have the chance, will we\nsuffer him to eat of it himself.  The same spirit inspired Miss Bird’s\nAmerican missionaries, who had come thousands of miles to change the\nfaith of Japan, and openly professed their ignorance of the religions\nthey were trying to supplant.\n\nI quote an American in this connection without scruple.  Uncle Sam is\nbetter than John Bull, but he is tarred with the English stick.  For Mr.\nGrant White the States are the New England States and nothing more.  He\nwonders at the amount of drinking in London; let him try San Francisco.\nHe wittily reproves English ignorance as to the status of women in\nAmerica; but has he not himself forgotten Wyoming?  The name Yankee, of\nwhich he is so tenacious, is used over the most of the great Union as a\nterm of reproach.  The Yankee States, of which he is so staunch a\nsubject, are but a drop in the bucket.  And we find in his book a vast\nvirgin ignorance of the life and prospects of America; every view\npartial, parochial, not raised to the horizon; the moral feeling proper,\nat the largest, to a clique of states; and the whole scope and atmosphere\nnot American, but merely Yankee.  I will go far beyond him in reprobating\nthe assumption and the incivility of my countryfolk to their cousins from\nbeyond the sea; I grill in my blood over the silly rudeness of our\nnewspaper articles; and I do not know where to look when I find myself in\ncompany with an American and see my countrymen unbending to him as to a\nperforming dog.  But in the case of Mr. Grant White example were better\nthan precept.  Wyoming is, after all, more readily accessible to Mr.\nWhite than Boston to the English, and the New England self-sufficiency no\nbetter justified than the Britannic.\n\nIt is so, perhaps, in all countries; perhaps in all, men are most\nignorant of the foreigners at home.  John Bull is ignorant of the States;\nhe is probably ignorant of India; but considering his opportunities, he\nis far more ignorant of countries nearer his own door.  There is one\ncountry, for instance—its frontier not so far from London, its people\nclosely akin, its language the same in all essentials with the English—of\nwhich I will go bail he knows nothing.  His ignorance of the sister\nkingdom cannot be described; it can only be illustrated by anecdote.  I\nonce travelled with a man of plausible manners and good intelligence—a\nUniversity man, as the phrase goes—a man, besides, who had taken his\ndegree in life and knew a thing or two about the age we live in.  We were\ndeep in talk, whirling between Peterborough and London; among other\nthings, he began to describe some piece of legal injustice he had\nrecently encountered, and I observed in my innocence that things were not\nso in Scotland.  “I beg your pardon,” said he, “this is a matter of law.”\nHe had never heard of the Scots law; nor did he choose to be informed.\nThe law was the same for the whole country, he told me roundly; every\nchild knew that.  At last, to settle matters, I explained to him that I\nwas a member of a Scottish legal body, and had stood the brunt of an\nexamination in the very law in question.  Thereupon he looked me for a\nmoment full in the face and dropped the conversation.  This is a\nmonstrous instance, if you like, but it does not stand alone in the\nexperience of Scots.\n\nEngland and Scotland differ, indeed, in law, in history, in religion, in\neducation, and in the very look of nature and men’s faces, not always\nwidely, but always trenchantly.  Many particulars that struck Mr. Grant\nWhite, a Yankee, struck me, a Scot, no less forcibly; he and I felt\nourselves foreigners on many common provocations.  A Scotchman may tramp\nthe better part of Europe and the United States, and never again receive\nso vivid an impression of foreign travel and strange lands and manners as\non his first excursion into England.  The change from a hilly to a level\ncountry strikes him with delighted wonder.  Along the flat horizon there\narise the frequent venerable towers of churches.  He sees at the end of\nairy vistas the revolution of the windmill sails.  He may go where he\npleases in the future; he may see Alps, and Pyramids, and lions; but it\nwill be hard to beat the pleasure of that moment.  There are, indeed, few\nmerrier spectacles than that of many windmills bickering together in a\nfresh breeze over a woody country; their halting alacrity of movement,\ntheir pleasant business, making bread all day with uncouth\ngesticulations, their air, gigantically human, as of a creature half\nalive, put a spirit of romance into the tamest landscape.  When the\nScotch child sees them first he falls immediately in love; and from that\ntime forward windmills keep turning in his dreams.  And so, in their\ndegree, with every feature of the life and landscape.  The warm,\nhabitable age of towns and hamlets, the green, settled, ancient look of\nthe country; the lush hedgerows, stiles, and privy path-ways in the\nfields; the sluggish, brimming rivers; chalk and smock-frocks; chimes of\nbells and the rapid, pertly-sounding English speech—they are all new to\nthe curiosity; they are all set to English airs in the child’s story that\nhe tells himself at night.  The sharp edge of novelty wears off; the\nfeeling is scotched, but I doubt whether it is ever killed.  Rather it\nkeeps returning, ever the more rarely and strangely, and even in scenes\nto which you have been long accustomed suddenly awakes and gives a relish\nto enjoyment or heightens the sense of isolation.\n\nOne thing especially continues unfamiliar to the Scotchman’s eye—the\ndomestic architecture, the look of streets and buildings; the quaint,\nvenerable age of many, and the thin walls and warm colouring of all.  We\nhave, in Scotland, far fewer ancient buildings, above all in country\nplaces; and those that we have are all of hewn or harled masonry.  Wood\nhas been sparingly used in their construction; the window-frames are\nsunken in the wall, not flat to the front, as in England; the roofs are\nsteeper-pitched; even a hill farm will have a massy, square, cold and\npermanent appearance.  English houses, in comparison, have the look of\ncardboard toys, such as a puff might shatter.  And to this the Scotchman\nnever becomes used.  His eye can never rest consciously on one of these\nbrick houses—rickles of brick, as he might call them—or on one of these\nflat-chested streets, but he is instantly reminded where he is, and\ninstantly travels back in fancy to his home.  “This is no my ain house; I\nken by the biggin’ o’t.”  And yet perhaps it is his own, bought with his\nown money, the key of it long polished in his pocket; but it has not yet,\nand never will be, thoroughly adopted by his imagination; nor does he\ncease to remember that, in the whole length and breadth of his native\ncountry, there was no building even distantly resembling it.\n\nBut it is not alone in scenery and architecture that we count England\nforeign.  The constitution of society, the very pillars of the empire,\nsurprise and even pain us.  The dull, neglected peasant, sunk in matter,\ninsolent, gross and servile, makes a startling contrast with our own\nlong-legged, long-headed, thoughtful, Bible-quoting ploughman.  A week or\ntwo in such a place as Suffolk leaves the Scotchman gasping.  It seems\nincredible that within the boundaries of his own island a class should\nhave been thus forgotten.  Even the educated and intelligent, who hold\nour own opinions and speak in our own words, yet seem to hold them with a\ndifference or, from another reason, and to speak on all things with less\ninterest and conviction.  The first shock of English society is like a\ncold plunge.  It is possible that the Scot comes looking for too much,\nand to be sure his first experiment will be in the wrong direction.  Yet\nsurely his complaint is grounded; surely the speech of Englishmen is too\noften lacking in generous ardour, the better part of the man too often\nwithheld from the social commerce, and the contact of mind with mind\nevaded as with terror.  A Scotch peasant will talk more liberally out of\nhis own experience.  He will not put you by with conversational counters\nand small jests; he will give you the best of himself, like one\ninterested in life and man’s chief end.  A Scotchman is vain, interested\nin himself and others, eager for sympathy, setting forth his thoughts and\nexperience in the best light.  The egoism of the Englishman is\nself-contained.  He does not seek to proselytise.  He takes no interest\nin Scotland or the Scotch, and, what is the unkindest cut of all, he does\nnot care to justify his indifference.  Give him the wages of going on and\nbeing an Englishman, that is all he asks; and in the meantime, while you\ncontinue to associate, he would rather not be reminded of your baser\norigin.  Compared with the grand, tree-like self-sufficiency of his\ndemeanour, the vanity and curiosity of the Scot seem uneasy, vulgar, and\nimmodest.  That you should continually try to establish human and serious\nrelations, that you should actually feel an interest in John Bull, and\ndesire and invite a return of interest from him, may argue something more\nawake and lively in your mind, but it still puts you in the attitude of a\nsuitor and a poor relation.  Thus even the lowest class of the educated\nEnglish towers over a Scotchman by the head and shoulders.\n\nDifferent indeed is the atmosphere in which Scotch and English youth\nbegin to look about them, come to themselves in life, and gather up those\nfirst apprehensions which are the material of future thought and, to a\ngreat extent, the rule of future conduct.  I have been to school in both\ncountries, and I found, in the boys of the North, something at once\nrougher and more tender, at once more reserve and more expansion, a\ngreater habitual distance chequered by glimpses of a nearer intimacy, and\non the whole wider extremes of temperament and sensibility.  The boy of\nthe South seems more wholesome, but less thoughtful; he gives himself to\ngames as to a business, striving to excel, but is not readily transported\nby imagination; the type remains with me as cleaner in mind and body,\nmore active, fonder of eating, endowed with a lesser and a less romantic\nsense of life and of the future, and more immersed in present\ncircumstances.  And certainly, for one thing, English boys are younger\nfor their age.  Sabbath observance makes a series of grim, and perhaps\nserviceable, pauses in the tenor of Scotch boyhood—days of great\nstillness and solitude for the rebellious mind, when in the dearth of\nbooks and play, and in the intervals of studying the Shorter Catechism,\nthe intellect and senses prey upon and test each other.  The typical\nEnglish Sunday, with the huge midday dinner and the plethoric afternoon,\nleads perhaps to different results.  About the very cradle of the Scot\nthere goes a hum of metaphysical divinity; and the whole of two divergent\nsystems is summed up, not merely speciously, in the two first questions\nof the rival catechisms, the English tritely inquiring, “What is your\nname?” the Scottish striking at the very roots of life with, “What is the\nchief end of man?” and answering nobly, if obscurely, “To glorify God and\nto enjoy Him for ever.”  I do not wish to make an idol of the Shorter\nCatechism; but the fact of such a question being asked opens to us Scotch\na great field of speculation; and the fact that it is asked of all of us,\nfrom the peer to the ploughboy, binds us more nearly together.  No\nEnglishman of Byron’s age, character, and history would have had patience\nfor long theological discussions on the way to fight for Greece; but the\ndaft Gordon blood and the Aberdonian school-days kept their influence to\nthe end.  We have spoken of the material conditions; nor need much more\nbe said of these: of the land lying everywhere more exposed, of the wind\nalways louder and bleaker, of the black, roaring winters, of the gloom of\nhigh-lying, old stone cities, imminent on the windy seaboard; compared\nwith the level streets, the warm colouring of the brick, the domestic\nquaintness of the architecture, among which English children begin to\ngrow up and come to themselves in life.  As the stage of the University\napproaches, the contrast becomes more express.  The English lad goes to\nOxford or Cambridge; there, in an ideal world of gardens, to lead a\nsemi-scenic life, costumed, disciplined and drilled by proctors.  Nor is\nthis to be regarded merely as a stage of education; it is a piece of\nprivilege besides, and a step that separates him further from the bulk of\nhis compatriots.  At an earlier age the Scottish lad begins his greatly\ndifferent experience of crowded class-rooms, of a gaunt quadrangle, of a\nbell hourly booming over the traffic of the city to recall him from the\npublic-house where he has been lunching, or the streets where he has been\nwandering fancy-free.  His college life has little of restraint, and\nnothing of necessary gentility.  He will find no quiet clique of the\nexclusive, studious and cultured; no rotten borough of the arts.  All\nclasses rub shoulders on the greasy benches.  The raffish young gentleman\nin gloves must measure his scholarship with the plain, clownish laddie\nfrom the parish school.  They separate, at the session’s end, one to\nsmoke cigars about a watering-place, the other to resume the labours of\nthe field beside his peasant family.  The first muster of a college class\nin Scotland is a scene of curious and painful interest; so many lads,\nfresh from the heather, hang round the stove in cloddish embarrassment,\nruffled by the presence of their smarter comrades, and afraid of the\nsound of their own rustic voices.  It was in these early days, I think,\nthat Professor Blackie won the affection of his pupils, putting these\nuncouth, umbrageous students at their ease with ready human geniality.\nThus, at least, we have a healthy democratic atmosphere to breathe in\nwhile at work; even when there is no cordiality there is always a\njuxtaposition of the different classes, and in the competition of study\nthe intellectual power of each is plainly demonstrated to the other.  Our\ntasks ended, we of the North go forth as freemen into the humming,\nlamplit city.  At five o’clock you may see the last of us hiving from the\ncollege gates, in the glare of the shop windows, under the green glimmer\nof the winter sunset.  The frost tingles in our blood; no proctor lies in\nwait to intercept us; till the bell sounds again, we are the masters of\nthe world; and some portion of our lives is always Saturday, _la trêve de\nDieu_.\n\nNor must we omit the sense of the nature of his country and his country’s\nhistory gradually growing in the child’s mind from story and from\nobservation.  A Scottish child hears much of shipwreck, outlying iron\nskerries, pitiless breakers, and great sea-lights; much of heathery\nmountains, wild clans, and hunted Covenanters.  Breaths come to him in\nsong of the distant Cheviots and the ring of foraying hoofs.  He glories\nin his hard-fisted forefathers, of the iron girdle and the handful of\noat-meal, who rode so swiftly and lived so sparely on their raids.\nPoverty, ill-luck, enterprise, and constant resolution are the fibres of\nthe legend of his country’s history.  The heroes and kings of Scotland\nhave been tragically fated; the most marking incidents in Scottish\nhistory—Flodden, Darien, or the Forty-five—were still either failures or\ndefeats; and the fall of Wallace and the repeated reverses of the Bruce\ncombine with the very smallness of the country to teach rather a moral\nthan a material criterion for life.  Britain is altogether small, the\nmere taproot of her extended empire: Scotland, again, which alone the\nScottish boy adopts in his imagination, is but a little part of that, and\navowedly cold, sterile and unpopulous.  It is not so for nothing.  I once\nseemed to have perceived in an American boy a greater readiness of\nsympathy for lands that are great, and rich, and growing, like his own.\nIt proved to be quite otherwise: a mere dumb piece of boyish romance,\nthat I had lacked penetration to divine.  But the error serves the\npurpose of my argument; for I am sure, at least, that the heart of young\nScotland will be always touched more nearly by paucity of number and\nSpartan poverty of life.\n\nSo we may argue, and yet the difference is not explained.  That Shorter\nCatechism which I took as being so typical of Scotland, was yet composed\nin the city of Westminster.  The division of races is more sharply marked\nwithin the borders of Scotland itself than between the countries.\nGalloway and Buchan, Lothian and Lochaber, are like foreign parts; yet\nyou may choose a man from any of them, and, ten to one, he shall prove to\nhave the headmark of a Scot.  A century and a half ago the Highlander\nwore a different costume, spoke a different language, worshipped in\nanother church, held different morals, and obeyed a different social\nconstitution from his fellow-countrymen either of the south or north.\nEven the English, it is recorded, did not loathe the Highlander and the\nHighland costume as they were loathed by the remainder of the Scotch.\nYet the Highlander felt himself a Scot.  He would willingly raid into the\nScotch lowlands; but his courage failed him at the border, and he\nregarded England as a perilous, unhomely land.  When the Black Watch,\nafter years of foreign service, returned to Scotland, veterans leaped out\nand kissed the earth at Port Patrick.  They had been in Ireland,\nstationed among men of their own race and language, where they were well\nliked and treated with affection; but it was the soil of Galloway that\nthey kissed at the extreme end of the hostile lowlands, among a people\nwho did not understand their speech, and who had hated, harried, and\nhanged them since the dawn of history.  Last, and perhaps most curious,\nthe sons of chieftains were often educated on the continent of Europe.\nThey went abroad speaking Gaelic; they returned speaking, not English,\nbut the broad dialect of Scotland.  Now, what idea had they in their\nminds when they thus, in thought, identified themselves with their\nancestral enemies?  What was the sense in which they were Scotch and not\nEnglish, or Scotch and not Irish?  Can a bare name be thus influential on\nthe minds and affections of men, and a political aggregation blind them\nto the nature of facts?  The story of the Austrian Empire would seem to\nanswer, NO; the far more galling business of Ireland clenches the\nnegative from nearer home.  Is it common education, common morals, a\ncommon language or a common faith, that join men into nations?  There\nwere practically none of these in the case we are considering.\n\nThe fact remains: in spite of the difference of blood and language, the\nLowlander feels himself the sentimental countryman of the Highlander.\nWhen they meet abroad, they fall upon each other’s necks in spirit; even\nat home there is a kind of clannish intimacy in their talk.  But from his\ncompatriot in the south the Lowlander stands consciously apart.  He has\nhad a different training; he obeys different laws; he makes his will in\nother terms, is otherwise divorced and married; his eyes are not at home\nin an English landscape or with English houses; his ear continues to\nremark the English speech; and even though his tongue acquire the\nSouthern knack, he will still have a strong Scotch accent of the mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. SOME COLLEGE MEMORIES {15}\n\n\nI am asked to write something (it is not specifically stated what) to the\nprofit and glory of my _Alma Mater_; and the fact is I seem to be in very\nnearly the same case with those who addressed me, for while I am willing\nenough to write something, I know not what to write.  Only one point I\nsee, that if I am to write at all, it should be of the University itself\nand my own days under its shadow; of the things that are still the same\nand of those that are already changed: such talk, in short, as would pass\nnaturally between a student of to-day and one of yesterday, supposing\nthem to meet and grow confidential.\n\nThe generations pass away swiftly enough on the high seas of life; more\nswiftly still in the little bubbling back-water of the quadrangle; so\nthat we see there, on a scale startlingly diminished, the flight of time\nand the succession of men.  I looked for my name the other day in last\nyear’s case-book of the Speculative.  Naturally enough I looked for it\nnear the end; it was not there, nor yet in the next column, so that I\nbegan to think it had been dropped at press; and when at last I found it,\nmounted on the shoulders of so many successors, and looking in that\nposture like the name of a man of ninety, I was conscious of some of the\ndignity of years.  This kind of dignity of temporal precession is likely,\nwith prolonged life, to become more familiar, possibly less welcome; but\nI felt it strongly then, it is strongly on me now, and I am the more\nemboldened to speak with my successors in the tone of a parent and a\npraiser of things past.\n\nFor, indeed, that which they attend is but a fallen University; it has\ndoubtless some remains of good, for human institutions decline by gradual\nstages; but decline, in spite of all seeming embellishments, it does; and\nwhat is perhaps more singular, began to do so when I ceased to be a\nstudent.  Thus, by an odd chance, I had the very last of the very best of\n_Alma Mater_; the same thing, I hear (which makes it the more strange),\nhad previously happened to my father; and if they are good and do not\ndie, something not at all unsimilar will be found in time to have\nbefallen my successors of to-day.  Of the specific points of change, of\nadvantage in the past, of shortcoming in the present, I must own that, on\na near examination, they look wondrous cloudy.  The chief and far the\nmost lamentable change is the absence of a certain lean, ugly, idle,\nunpopular student, whose presence was for me the gist and heart of the\nwhole matter; whose changing humours, fine occasional purposes of good,\nflinching acceptance of evil, shiverings on wet, east-windy, morning\njourneys up to class, infinite yawnings during lecture and unquenchable\ngusto in the delights of truantry, made up the sunshine and shadow of my\ncollege life.  You cannot fancy what you missed in missing him; his\nvirtues, I make sure, are inconceivable to his successors, just as they\nwere apparently concealed from his contemporaries, for I was practically\nalone in the pleasure I had in his society.  Poor soul, I remember how\nmuch he was cast down at times, and how life (which had not yet begun)\nseemed to be already at an end, and hope quite dead, and misfortune and\ndishonour, like physical presences, dogging him as he went.  And it may\nbe worth while to add that these clouds rolled away in their season, and\nthat all clouds roll away at last, and the troubles of youth in\nparticular are things but of a moment.  So this student, whom I have in\nmy eye, took his full share of these concerns, and that very largely by\nhis own fault; but he still clung to his fortune, and in the midst of\nmuch misconduct, kept on in his own way learning how to work; and at\nlast, to his wonder, escaped out of the stage of studentship not openly\nshamed; leaving behind him the University of Edinburgh shorn of a good\ndeal of its interest for myself.\n\nBut while he is (in more senses than one) the first person, he is by no\nmeans the only one whom I regret, or whom the students of to-day, if they\nknew what they had lost, would regret also.  They have still Tait, to be\nsure—long may they have him!—and they have still Tait’s class-room,\ncupola and all; but think of what a different place it was when this\nyouth of mine (at least on roll days) would be present on the benches,\nand, at the near end of the platform, Lindsay senior {17} was airing his\nrobust old age.  It is possible my successors may have never even heard\nof Old Lindsay; but when he went, a link snapped with the last century.\nHe had something of a rustic air, sturdy and fresh and plain; he spoke\nwith a ripe east-country accent, which I used to admire; his\nreminiscences were all of journeys on foot or highways busy with\npost-chaises—a Scotland before steam; he had seen the coal fire on the\nIsle of May, and he regaled me with tales of my own grandfather.  Thus he\nwas for me a mirror of things perished; it was only in his memory that I\ncould see the huge shock of flames of the May beacon stream to leeward,\nand the watchers, as they fed the fire, lay hold unscorched of the\nwindward bars of the furnace; it was only thus that I could see my\ngrandfather driving swiftly in a gig along the seaboard road from\nPittenweem to Crail, and for all his business hurry, drawing up to speak\ngood-humouredly with those he met.  And now, in his turn, Lindsay is gone\nalso; inhabits only the memories of other men, till these shall follow\nhim; and figures in my reminiscences as my grandfather figured in his.\n\nTo-day, again, they have Professor Butcher, and I hear he has a\nprodigious deal of Greek; and they have Professor Chrystal, who is a man\nfilled with the mathematics.  And doubtless these are set-offs.  But they\ncannot change the fact that Professor Blackie has retired, and that\nProfessor Kelland is dead.  No man’s education is complete or truly\nliberal who knew not Kelland.  There were unutterable lessons in the mere\nsight of that frail old clerical gentleman, lively as a boy, kind like a\nfairy godfather, and keeping perfect order in his class by the spell of\nthat very kindness.  I have heard him drift into reminiscences in class\ntime, though not for long, and give us glimpses of old-world life in\nout-of-the-way English parishes when he was young; thus playing the same\npart as Lindsay—the part of the surviving memory, signalling out of the\ndark backward and abysm of time the images of perished things.  But it\nwas a part that scarce became him; he somehow lacked the means: for all\nhis silver hair and worn face, he was not truly old; and he had too much\nof the unrest and petulant fire of youth, and too much invincible\ninnocence of mind, to play the veteran well.  The time to measure him\nbest, to taste (in the old phrase) his gracious nature, was when he\nreceived his class at home.  What a pretty simplicity would he then show,\ntrying to amuse us like children with toys; and what an engaging\nnervousness of manner, as fearing that his efforts might not succeed!\nTruly he made us all feel like children, and like children embarrassed,\nbut at the same time filled with sympathy for the conscientious, troubled\nelder-boy who was working so hard to entertain us.  A theorist has held\nthe view that there is no feature in man so tell-tale as his spectacles;\nthat the mouth may be compressed and the brow smoothed artificially, but\nthe sheen of the barnacles is diagnostic.  And truly it must have been\nthus with Kelland; for as I still fancy I behold him frisking actively\nabout the platform, pointer in hand, that which I seem to see most\nclearly is the way his glasses glittered with affection.  I never knew\nbut one other man who had (if you will permit the phrase) so kind a\nspectacle; and that was Dr. Appleton.  But the light in his case was\ntempered and passive; in Kelland’s it danced, and changed, and flashed\nvivaciously among the students, like a perpetual challenge to goodwill.\n\nI cannot say so much about Professor Blackie, for a good reason.\nKelland’s class I attended, once even gained there a certificate of\nmerit, the only distinction of my University career.  But although I am\nthe holder of a certificate of attendance in the professor’s own hand, I\ncannot remember to have been present in the Greek class above a dozen\ntimes.  Professor Blackie was even kind enough to remark (more than once)\nwhile in the very act of writing the document above referred to, that he\ndid not know my face.  Indeed, I denied myself many opportunities; acting\nupon an extensive and highly rational system of truantry, which cost me a\ngreat deal of trouble to put in exercise—perhaps as much as would have\ntaught me Greek—and sent me forth into the world and the profession of\nletters with the merest shadow of an education.  But they say it is\nalways a good thing to have taken pains, and that success is its own\nreward, whatever be its nature; so that, perhaps, even upon this I should\nplume myself, that no one ever played the truant with more deliberate\ncare, and none ever had more certificates for less education.  One\nconsequence, however, of my system is that I have much less to say of\nProfessor Blackie than I had of Professor Kelland; and as he is still\nalive, and will long, I hope, continue to be so, it will not surprise you\nvery much that I have no intention of saying it.\n\nMeanwhile, how many others have gone—Jenkin, Hodgson, and I know not who\nbesides; and of that tide of students that used to throng the arch and\nblacken the quadrangle, how many are scattered into the remotest parts of\nthe earth, and how many more have lain down beside their fathers in their\n“resting-graves”!  And again, how many of these last have not found their\nway there, all too early, through the stress of education!  That was one\nthing, at least, from which my truantry protected me.  I am sorry indeed\nthat I have no Greek, but I should be sorrier still if I were dead; nor\ndo I know the name of that branch of knowledge which is worth acquiring\nat the price of a brain fever.  There are many sordid tragedies in the\nlife of the student, above all if he be poor, or drunken, or both; but\nnothing more moves a wise man’s pity than the case of the lad who is in\ntoo much hurry to be learned.  And so, for the sake of a moral at the\nend, I will call up one more figure, and have done.  A student, ambitious\nof success by that hot, intemperate manner of study that now grows so\ncommon, read night and day for an examination.  As he went on, the task\nbecame more easy to him, sleep was more easily banished, his brain grew\nhot and clear and more capacious, the necessary knowledge daily fuller\nand more orderly.  It came to the eve of the trial and he watched all\nnight in his high chamber, reviewing what he knew, and already secure of\nsuccess.  His window looked eastward, and being (as I said) high up, and\nthe house itself standing on a hill, commanded a view over dwindling\nsuburbs to a country horizon.  At last my student drew up his blind, and\nstill in quite a jocund humour, looked abroad.  Day was breaking, the\neast was tinging with strange fires, the clouds breaking up for the\ncoming of the sun; and at the sight, nameless terror seized upon his\nmind.  He was sane, his senses were undisturbed; he saw clearly, and knew\nwhat he was seeing, and knew that it was normal; but he could neither\nbear to see it nor find the strength to look away, and fled in panic from\nhis chamber into the enclosure of the street.  In the cool air and\nsilence, and among the sleeping houses, his strength was renewed.\nNothing troubled him but the memory of what had passed, and an abject\nfear of its return.\n\n    “Gallo canente, spes redit,\n    Aegris salus refunditur,\n    Lapsis fides revertitur,”\n\nas they sang of old in Portugal in the Morning Office.  But to him that\ngood hour of cockcrow, and the changes of the dawn, had brought panic,\nand lasting doubt, and such terror as he still shook to think of.  He\ndared not return to his lodging; he could not eat; he sat down, he rose\nup, he wandered; the city woke about him with its cheerful bustle, the\nsun climbed overhead; and still he grew but the more absorbed in the\ndistress of his recollection and the fear of his past fear.  At the\nappointed hour, he came to the door of the place of examination; but when\nhe was asked, he had forgotten his name.  Seeing him so disordered, they\nhad not the heart to send him away, but gave him a paper and admitted\nhim, still nameless, to the Hall.  Vain kindness, vain efforts.  He could\nonly sit in a still growing horror, writing nothing, ignorant of all, his\nmind filled with a single memory of the breaking day and his own\nintolerable fear.  And that same night he was tossing in a brain fever.\n\nPeople are afraid of war and wounds and dentists, all with excellent\nreason; but these are not to be compared with such chaotic terrors of the\nmind as fell on this young man, and made him cover his eyes from the\ninnocent morning.  We all have by our bedsides the box of the Merchant\nAbudah, thank God, securely enough shut; but when a young man sacrifices\nsleep to labour, let him have a care, for he is playing with the lock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. OLD MORTALITY\n\n\nI\n\n\nThere is a certain graveyard, looked upon on the one side by a prison, on\nthe other by the windows of a quiet hotel; below, under a steep cliff, it\nbeholds the traffic of many lines of rail, and the scream of the engine\nand the shock of meeting buffers mount to it all day long.  The aisles\nare lined with the inclosed sepulchres of families, door beyond door,\nlike houses in a street; and in the morning the shadow of the prison\nturrets, and of many tall memorials, fall upon the graves.  There, in the\nhot fits of youth, I came to be unhappy.  Pleasant incidents are woven\nwith my memory of the place.  I here made friends with a plain old\ngentleman, a visitor on sunny mornings, gravely cheerful, who, with one\neye upon the place that awaited him, chirped about his youth like winter\nsparrows; a beautiful housemaid of the hotel once, for some days\ntogether, dumbly flirted with me from a window and kept my wild heart\nflying; and once—she possibly remembers—the wise Eugenia followed me to\nthat austere inclosure.  Her hair came down, and in the shelter of the\ntomb my trembling fingers helped her to repair the braid.  But for the\nmost part I went there solitary and, with irrevocable emotion, pored on\nthe names of the forgotten.  Name after name, and to each the\nconventional attributions and the idle dates: a regiment of the unknown\nthat had been the joy of mothers, and had thrilled with the illusions of\nyouth, and at last, in the dim sick-room, wrestled with the pangs of old\nmortality.  In that whole crew of the silenced there was but one of whom\nmy fancy had received a picture; and he, with his comely, florid\ncountenance, bewigged and habited in scarlet, and in his day combining\nfame and popularity, stood forth, like a taunt, among that company of\nphantom appellations.  It was then possible to leave behind us something\nmore explicit than these severe, monotonous and lying epitaphs; and the\nthing left, the memory of a painted picture and what we call the\nimmortality of a name, was hardly more desirable than mere oblivion.\nEven David Hume, as he lay composed beneath that “circular idea,” was\nfainter than a dream; and when the housemaid, broom in hand, smiled and\nbeckoned from the open window, the fame of that bewigged philosopher\nmelted like a raindrop in the sea.\n\nAnd yet in soberness I cared as little for the housemaid as for David\nHume.  The interests of youth are rarely frank; his passions, like Noah’s\ndove, come home to roost.  The fire, sensibility, and volume of his own\nnature, that is all that he has learned to recognise.  The tumultuary and\ngray tide of life, the empire of routine, the unrejoicing faces of his\nelders, fill him with contemptuous surprise; there also he seems to walk\namong the tombs of spirits; and it is only in the course of years, and\nafter much rubbing with his fellow-men, that he begins by glimpses to see\nhimself from without and his fellows from within: to know his own for one\namong the thousand undenoted countenances of the city street, and to\ndivine in others the throb of human agony and hope.  In the meantime he\nwill avoid the hospital doors, the pale faces, the cripple, the sweet\nwhiff of chloroform—for there, on the most thoughtless, the pains of\nothers are burned home; but he will continue to walk, in a divine\nself-pity, the aisles of the forgotten graveyard.  The length of man’s\nlife, which is endless to the brave and busy, is scorned by his ambitious\nthought.  He cannot bear to have come for so little, and to go again so\nwholly.  He cannot bear, above all, in that brief scene, to be still\nidle, and by way of cure, neglects the little that he has to do.  The\nparable of the talent is the brief epitome of youth.  To believe in\nimmortality is one thing, but it is first needful to believe in life.\nDenunciatory preachers seem not to suspect that they may be taken gravely\nand in evil part; that young men may come to think of time as of a\nmoment, and with the pride of Satan wave back the inadequate gift.  Yet\nhere is a true peril; this it is that sets them to pace the graveyard\nalleys and to read, with strange extremes of pity and derision, the\nmemorials of the dead.\n\nBooks were the proper remedy: books of vivid human import, forcing upon\ntheir minds the issues, pleasures, busyness, importance and immediacy of\nthat life in which they stand; books of smiling or heroic temper, to\nexcite or to console; books of a large design, shadowing the complexity\nof that game of consequences to which we all sit down, the hanger-back\nnot least.  But the average sermon flees the point, disporting itself in\nthat eternity of which we know, and need to know, so little; avoiding the\nbright, crowded, and momentous fields of life where destiny awaits us.\nUpon the average book a writer may be silent; he may set it down to his\nill-hap that when his own youth was in the acrid fermentation, he should\nhave fallen and fed upon the cheerless fields of Obermann.  Yet to Mr.\nArnold, who led him to these pastures, he still bears a grudge.  The day\nis perhaps not far off when people will begin to count _Moll Flanders_,\nay, or _The Country Wife_, more wholesome and more pious diet than these\nguide-books to consistent egoism.\n\nBut the most inhuman of boys soon wearies of the inhumanity of Obermann.\nAnd even while I still continued to be a haunter of the graveyard, I\nbegan insensibly to turn my attention to the grave-diggers, and was\nweaned out of myself to observe the conduct of visitors.  This was\ndayspring, indeed, to a lad in such great darkness.  Not that I began to\nsee men, or to try to see them, from within, nor to learn charity and\nmodesty and justice from the sight; but still stared at them externally\nfrom the prison windows of my affectation.  Once I remember to have\nobserved two working-women with a baby halting by a grave; there was\nsomething monumental in the grouping, one upright carrying the child, the\nother with bowed face crouching by her side.  A wreath of immortelles\nunder a glass dome had thus attracted them; and, drawing near, I\noverheard their judgment on that wonder.  “Eh! what extravagance!”  To a\nyouth afflicted with the callosity of sentiment, this quaint and pregnant\nsaying appeared merely base.\n\nMy acquaintance with grave-diggers, considering its length, was\nunremarkable.  One, indeed, whom I found plying his spade in the red\nevening, high above Allan Water and in the shadow of Dunblane Cathedral,\ntold me of his acquaintance with the birds that still attended on his\nlabours; how some would even perch about him, waiting for their prey; and\nin a true Sexton’s Calendar, how the species varied with the season of\nthe year.  But this was the very poetry of the profession.  The others\nwhom I knew were somewhat dry.  A faint flavour of the gardener hung\nabout them, but sophisticated and dis-bloomed.  They had engagements to\nkeep, not alone with the deliberate series of the seasons, but with\nman-kind’s clocks and hour-long measurement of time.  And thus there was\nno leisure for the relishing pinch, or the hour-long gossip, foot on\nspade.  They were men wrapped up in their grim business; they liked well\nto open long-closed family vaults, blowing in the key and throwing wide\nthe grating; and they carried in their minds a calendar of names and\ndates.  It would be “in fifty-twa” that such a tomb was last opened for\n“Miss Jemimy.”  It was thus they spoke of their past patients—familiarly\nbut not without respect, like old family servants.  Here is indeed a\nservant, whom we forget that we possess; who does not wait at the bright\ntable, or run at the bell’s summons, but patiently smokes his pipe beside\nthe mortuary fire, and in his faithful memory notches the burials of our\nrace.  To suspect Shakespeare in his maturity of a superficial touch\nsavours of paradox; yet he was surely in error when he attributed\ninsensibility to the digger of the grave.  But perhaps it is on Hamlet\nthat the charge should lie; or perhaps the English sexton differs from\nthe Scotch.  The “goodman delver,” reckoning up his years of office,\nmight have at least suggested other thoughts.  It is a pride common among\nsextons.  A cabinet-maker does not count his cabinets, nor even an author\nhis volumes, save when they stare upon him from the shelves; but the\ngrave-digger numbers his graves.  He would indeed be something different\nfrom human if his solitary open-air and tragic labours left not a broad\nmark upon his mind.  There, in his tranquil aisle, apart from city\nclamour, among the cats and robins and the ancient effigies and legends\nof the tomb, he waits the continual passage of his contemporaries,\nfalling like minute drops into eternity.  As they fall, he counts them;\nand this enumeration, which was at first perhaps appalling to his soul,\nin the process of years and by the kindly influence of habit grows to be\nhis pride and pleasure.  There are many common stories telling how he\npiques himself on crowded cemeteries.  But I will rather tell of the old\ngrave-digger of Monkton, to whose unsuffering bedside the minister was\nsummoned.  He dwelt in a cottage built into the wall of the church-yard;\nand through a bull’s-eye pane above his bed he could see, as he lay\ndying, the rank grasses and the upright and recumbent stones.  Dr. Laurie\nwas, I think, a Moderate: ’tis certain, at least, that he took a very\nRoman view of deathbed dispositions; for he told the old man that he had\nlived beyond man’s natural years, that his life had been easy and\nreputable, that his family had all grown up and been a credit to his\ncare, and that it now behoved him unregretfully to gird his loins and\nfollow the majority.  The grave-digger heard him out; then he raised\nhimself upon one elbow, and with the other hand pointed through the\nwindow to the scene of his life-long labours.  “Doctor,” he said, “I ha’e\nlaid three hunner and fower-score in that kirkyaird; an it had been His\nwull,” indicating Heaven, “I would ha’e likit weel to ha’e made out the\nfower hunner.”  But it was not to be; this tragedian of the fifth act had\nnow another part to play; and the time had come when others were to gird\nand carry him.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI would fain strike a note that should be more heroical; but the ground\nof all youth’s suffering, solitude, hysteria, and haunting of the grave,\nis nothing else than naked, ignorant selfishness.  It is himself that he\nsees dead; those are his virtues that are forgotten; his is the vague\nepitaph.  Pity him but the more, if pity be your cue; for where a man is\nall pride, vanity, and personal aspiration, he goes through fire\nunshielded.  In every part and corner of our life, to lose oneself is to\nbe gainer; to forget oneself is to be happy; and this poor, laughable and\ntragic fool has not yet learned the rudiments; himself, giant Prometheus,\nis still ironed on the peaks of Caucasus.  But by-and-by his truant\ninterests will leave that tortured body, slip abroad and gather flowers.\nThen shall death appear before him in an altered guise; no longer as a\ndoom peculiar to himself, whether fate’s crowning injustice or his own\nlast vengeance upon those who fail to value him; but now as a power that\nwounds him far more tenderly, not without solemn compensations, taking\nand giving, bereaving and yet storing up.\n\nThe first step for all is to learn to the dregs our own ignoble\nfallibility.  When we have fallen through storey after storey of our\nvanity and aspiration, and sit rueful among the ruins, then it is that we\nbegin to measure the stature of our friends: how they stand between us\nand our own contempt, believing in our best; how, linking us with others,\nand still spreading wide the influential circle, they weave us in and in\nwith the fabric of contemporary life; and to what petty size they dwarf\nthe virtues and the vices that appeared gigantic in our youth.  So that\nat the last, when such a pin falls out—when there vanishes in the least\nbreath of time one of those rich magazines of life on which we drew for\nour supply—when he who had first dawned upon us as a face among the faces\nof the city, and, still growing, came to bulk on our regard with those\nclear features of the loved and living man, falls in a breath to memory\nand shadow, there falls along with him a whole wing of the palace of our\nlife.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nOne such face I now remember; one such blank some half-a-dozen of us\nlabour to dissemble.  In his youth he was most beautiful in person, most\nserene and genial by disposition; full of racy words and quaint thoughts.\nLaughter attended on his coming.  He had the air of a great gentleman,\njovial and royal with his equals, and to the poorest student gentle and\nattentive.  Power seemed to reside in him exhaustless; we saw him stoop\nto play with us, but held him marked for higher destinies; we loved his\nnotice; and I have rarely had my pride more gratified than when he sat at\nmy father’s table, my acknowledged friend.  So he walked among us, both\nhands full of gifts, carrying with nonchalance the seeds of a most\ninfluential life.\n\nThe powers and the ground of friendship is a mystery; but, looking back,\nI can discern that, in part, we loved the thing he was, for some shadow\nof what he was to be.  For with all his beauty, power, breeding, urbanity\nand mirth, there was in those days something soulless in our friend.  He\nwould astonish us by sallies, witty, innocent and inhumane; and by a\nmisapplied Johnsonian pleasantry, demolish honest sentiment.  I can still\nsee and hear him, as he went his way along the lamplit streets, _Là ci\ndarem la mano_ on his lips, a noble figure of a youth, but following\nvanity and incredulous of good; and sure enough, somewhere on the high\nseas of life, with his health, his hopes, his patrimony and his\nself-respect, miserably went down.\n\nFrom this disaster, like a spent swimmer, he came desperately ashore,\nbankrupt of money and consideration; creeping to the family he had\ndeserted; with broken wing, never more to rise.  But in his face there\nwas a light of knowledge that was new to it.  Of the wounds of his body\nhe was never healed; died of them gradually, with clear-eyed resignation;\nof his wounded pride, we knew only from his silence.  He returned to that\ncity where he had lorded it in his ambitious youth; lived there alone,\nseeing few; striving to retrieve the irretrievable; at times still\ngrappling with that mortal frailty that had brought him down; still\njoying in his friend’s successes; his laugh still ready but with kindlier\nmusic; and over all his thoughts the shadow of that unalterable law which\nhe had disavowed and which had brought him low.  Lastly, when his bodily\nevils had quite disabled him, he lay a great while dying, still without\ncomplaint, still finding interests; to his last step gentle, urbane and\nwith the will to smile.\n\nThe tale of this great failure is, to those who remained true to him, the\ntale of a success.  In his youth he took thought for no one but himself;\nwhen he came ashore again, his whole armada lost, he seemed to think of\nnone but others.  Such was his tenderness for others, such his instinct\nof fine courtesy and pride, that of that impure passion of remorse he\nnever breathed a syllable; even regret was rare with him, and pointed\nwith a jest.  You would not have dreamed, if you had known him then, that\nthis was that great failure, that beacon to young men, over whose fall a\nwhole society had hissed and pointed fingers.  Often have we gone to him,\nred-hot with our own hopeful sorrows, railing on the rose-leaves in our\nprincely bed of life, and he would patiently give ear and wisely counsel;\nand it was only upon some return of our own thoughts that we were\nreminded what manner of man this was to whom we disembosomed: a man, by\nhis own fault, ruined; shut out of the garden of his gifts; his whole\ncity of hope both ploughed and salted; silently awaiting the deliverer.\nThen something took us by the throat; and to see him there, so gentle,\npatient, brave and pious, oppressed but not cast down, sorrow was so\nswallowed up in admiration that we could not dare to pity him.  Even if\nthe old fault flashed out again, it but awoke our wonder that, in that\nlost battle, he should have still the energy to fight.  He had gone to\nruin with a kind of kingly _abandon_, like one who condescended; but once\nruined, with the lights all out, he fought as for a kingdom.  Most men,\nfinding themselves the authors of their own disgrace, rail the louder\nagainst God or destiny.  Most men, when they repent, oblige their friends\nto share the bitterness of that repentance.  But he had held an inquest\nand passed sentence: _mene_, _mene_; and condemned himself to smiling\nsilence.  He had given trouble enough; had earned misfortune amply, and\nforegone the right to murmur.\n\nThus was our old comrade, like Samson, careless in his days of strength;\nbut on the coming of adversity, and when that strength was gone that had\nbetrayed him—“for our strength is weakness”—he began to blossom and bring\nforth.  Well, now, he is out of the fight: the burden that he bore thrown\ndown before the great deliverer.  We\n\n       “In the vast cathedral leave him;\n    God accept him,\n    Christ receive him!”\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nIf we go now and look on these innumerable epitaphs, the pathos and the\nirony are strangely fled.  They do not stand merely to the dead, these\nfoolish monuments; they are pillars and legends set up to glorify the\ndifficult but not desperate life of man.  This ground is hallowed by the\nheroes of defeat.\n\nI see the indifferent pass before my friend’s last resting-place; pause,\nwith a shrug of pity, marvelling that so rich an argosy had sunk.  A\npity, now that he is done with suffering, a pity most uncalled for, and\nan ignorant wonder.  Before those who loved him, his memory shines like a\nreproach; they honour him for silent lessons; they cherish his example;\nand in what remains before them of their toil, fear to be unworthy of the\ndead.  For this proud man was one of those who prospered in the valley of\nhumiliation;—of whom Bunyan wrote that, “Though Christian had the hard\nhap to meet in the valley with Apollyon, yet I must tell you, that in\nformer times men have met with angels here; have found pearls here; and\nhave in this place found the words of life.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. A COLLEGE MAGAZINE\n\n\nI\n\n\nAll through my boyhood and youth, I was known and pointed out for the\npattern of an idler; and yet I was always busy on my own private end,\nwhich was to learn to write.  I kept always two books in my pocket, one\nto read, one to write in.  As I walked, my mind was busy fitting what I\nsaw with appropriate words; when I sat by the roadside, I would either\nread, or a pencil and a penny version-book would be in my hand, to note\ndown the features of the scene or commemorate some halting stanzas.  Thus\nI lived with words.  And what I thus wrote was for no ulterior use, it\nwas written consciously for practice.  It was not so much that I wished\nto be an author (though I wished that too) as that I had vowed that I\nwould learn to write.  That was a proficiency that tempted me; and I\npractised to acquire it, as men learn to whittle, in a wager with myself.\nDescription was the principal field of my exercise; for to any one with\nsenses there is always something worth describing, and town and country\nare but one continuous subject.  But I worked in other ways also; often\naccompanied my walks with dramatic dialogues, in which I played many\nparts; and often exercised myself in writing down conversations from\nmemory.\n\nThis was all excellent, no doubt; so were the diaries I sometimes tried\nto keep, but always and very speedily discarded, finding them a school of\nposturing and melancholy self-deception.  And yet this was not the most\nefficient part of my training.  Good though it was, it only taught me (so\nfar as I have learned them at all) the lower and less intellectual\nelements of the art, the choice of the essential note and the right word:\nthings that to a happier constitution had perhaps come by nature.  And\nregarded as training, it had one grave defect; for it set me no standard\nof achievement.  So that there was perhaps more profit, as there was\ncertainly more effort, in my secret labours at home.  Whenever I read a\nbook or a passage that particularly pleased me, in which a thing was said\nor an effect rendered with propriety, in which there was either some\nconspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style, I must sit down\nat once and set myself to ape that quality.  I was unsuccessful, and I\nknew it; and tried again, and was again unsuccessful and always\nunsuccessful; but at least in these vain bouts, I got some practice in\nrhythm, in harmony, in construction and the co-ordination of parts.  I\nhave thus played the sedulous ape to Hazlitt, to Lamb, to Wordsworth, to\nSir Thomas Browne, to Defoe, to Hawthorne, to Montaigne, to Baudelaire\nand to Obermann.  I remember one of these monkey tricks, which was called\n_The Vanity of Morals_: it was to have had a second part, _The Vanity of\nKnowledge_; and as I had neither morality nor scholarship, the names were\napt; but the second part was never attempted, and the first part was\nwritten (which is my reason for recalling it, ghost-like, from its ashes)\nno less than three times: first in the manner of Hazlitt, second in the\nmanner of Ruskin, who had cast on me a passing spell, and third, in a\nlaborious pasticcio of Sir Thomas Browne.  So with my other works:\n_Cain_, an epic, was (save the mark!) an imitation of _Sordello_: _Robin\nHood_, a tale in verse, took an eclectic middle course among the fields\nof Keats, Chaucer and Morris: in _Monmouth_, a tragedy, I reclined on the\nbosom of Mr. Swinburne; in my innumerable gouty-footed lyrics, I followed\nmany masters; in the first draft of _The King’s Pardon_, a tragedy, I was\non the trail of no lesser man than John Webster; in the second draft of\nthe same piece, with staggering versatility, I had shifted my allegiance\nto Congreve, and of course conceived my fable in a less serious vein—for\nit was not Congreve’s verse, it was his exquisite prose, that I admired\nand sought to copy.  Even at the age of thirteen I had tried to do\njustice to the inhabitants of the famous city of Peebles in the style of\nthe _Book of Snobs_.  So I might go on for ever, through all my abortive\nnovels, and down to my later plays, of which I think more tenderly, for\nthey were not only conceived at first under the bracing influence of old\nDumas, but have met with resurrection: one, strangely bettered by another\nhand, came on the stage itself and was played by bodily actors; the\nother, originally known as _Semiramis_: _a Tragedy_, I have observed on\nbookstalls under the _alias_ of _Prince Otto_.  But enough has been said\nto show by what arts of impersonation, and in what purely ventriloquial\nefforts I first saw my words on paper.\n\nThat, like it or not, is the way to learn to write whether I have\nprofited or not, that is the way.  It was so Keats learned, and there was\nnever a finer temperament for literature than Keats’s; it was so, if we\ncould trace it out, that all men have learned; and that is why a revival\nof letters is always accompanied or heralded by a cast back to earlier\nand fresher models.  Perhaps I hear some one cry out: But this is not the\nway to be original!  It is not; nor is there any way but to be born so.\nNor yet, if you are born original, is there anything in this training\nthat shall clip the wings of your originality.  There can be none more\noriginal than Montaigne, neither could any be more unlike Cicero; yet no\ncraftsman can fail to see how much the one must have tried in his time to\nimitate the other.  Burns is the very type of a prime force in letters:\nhe was of all men the most imitative.  Shakespeare himself, the imperial,\nproceeds directly from a school.  It is only from a school that we can\nexpect to have good writers; it is almost invariably from a school that\ngreat writers, these lawless exceptions, issue.  Nor is there anything\nhere that should astonish the considerate.  Before he can tell what\ncadences he truly prefers, the student should have tried all that are\npossible; before he can choose and preserve a fitting key of words, he\nshould long have practised the literary scales; and it is only after\nyears of such gymnastic that he can sit down at last, legions of words\nswarming to his call, dozens of turns of phrase simultaneously bidding\nfor his choice, and he himself knowing what he wants to do and (within\nthe narrow limit of a man’s ability) able to do it.\n\nAnd it is the great point of these imitations that there still shines\nbeyond the student’s reach his inimitable model.  Let him try as he\nplease, he is still sure of failure; and it is a very old and a very true\nsaying that failure is the only highroad to success.  I must have had\nsome disposition to learn; for I clear-sightedly condemned my own\nperformances.  I liked doing them indeed; but when they were done, I\ncould see they were rubbish.  In consequence, I very rarely showed them\neven to my friends; and such friends as I chose to be my confidants I\nmust have chosen well, for they had the friendliness to be quite plain\nwith me, “Padding,” said one.  Another wrote: “I cannot understand why\nyou do lyrics so badly.”  No more could I!  Thrice I put myself in the\nway of a more authoritative rebuff, by sending a paper to a magazine.\nThese were returned; and I was not surprised nor even pained.  If they\nhad not been looked at, as (like all amateurs) I suspected was the case,\nthere was no good in repeating the experiment; if they had been looked\nat—well, then I had not yet learned to write, and I must keep on learning\nand living.  Lastly, I had a piece of good fortune which is the occasion\nof this paper, and by which I was able to see my literature in print, and\nto measure experimentally how far I stood from the favour of the public.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe Speculative Society is a body of some antiquity, and has counted\namong its members Scott, Brougham, Jeffrey, Horner, Benjamin Constant,\nRobert Emmet, and many a legal and local celebrity besides.  By an\naccident, variously explained, it has its rooms in the very buildings of\nthe University of Edinburgh: a hall, Turkey-carpeted, hung with pictures,\nlooking, when lighted up at night with fire and candle, like some goodly\ndining-room; a passage-like library, walled with books in their wire\ncages; and a corridor with a fireplace, benches, a table, many prints of\nfamous members, and a mural tablet to the virtues of a former secretary.\nHere a member can warm himself and loaf and read; here, in defiance of\nSenatus-consults, he can smoke.  The Senatus looks askance at these\nprivileges; looks even with a somewhat vinegar aspect on the whole\nsociety; which argues a lack of proportion in the learned mind, for the\nworld, we may be sure, will prize far higher this haunt of dead lions\nthan all the living dogs of the professorate.\n\nI sat one December morning in the library of the Speculative; a very\nhumble-minded youth, though it was a virtue I never had much credit for;\nyet proud of my privileges as a member of the Spec.; proud of the pipe I\nwas smoking in the teeth of the Senatus; and in particular, proud of\nbeing in the next room to three very distinguished students, who were\nthen conversing beside the corridor fire.  One of these has now his name\non the back of several volumes, and his voice, I learn, is influential in\nthe law courts.  Of the death of the second, you have just been reading\nwhat I had to say.  And the third also has escaped out of that battle of\nlife in which he fought so hard, it may be so unwisely.  They were all\nthree, as I have said, notable students; but this was the most\nconspicuous.  Wealthy, handsome, ambitious, adventurous, diplomatic, a\nreader of Balzac, and of all men that I have known, the most like to one\nof Balzac’s characters, he led a life, and was attended by an ill\nfortune, that could be properly set forth only in the _Comédie Humaine_.\nHe had then his eye on Parliament; and soon after the time of which I\nwrite, he made a showy speech at a political dinner, was cried up to\nheaven next day in the _Courant_, and the day after was dashed lower than\nearth with a charge of plagiarism in the _Scotsman_.  Report would have\nit (I daresay, very wrongly) that he was betrayed by one in whom he\nparticularly trusted, and that the author of the charge had learned its\ntruth from his own lips.  Thus, at least, he was up one day on a\npinnacle, admired and envied by all; and the next, though still but a\nboy, he was publicly disgraced.  The blow would have broken a less finely\ntempered spirit; and even him I suppose it rendered reckless; for he took\nflight to London, and there, in a fast club, disposed of the bulk of his\nconsiderable patrimony in the space of one winter.  For years thereafter\nhe lived I know not how; always well dressed, always in good hotels and\ngood society, always with empty pockets.  The charm of his manner may\nhave stood him in good stead; but though my own manners are very\nagreeable, I have never found in them a source of livelihood; and to\nexplain the miracle of his continued existence, I must fall back upon the\ntheory of the philosopher, that in his case, as in all of the same kind,\n“there was a suffering relative in the background.”  From this genteel\neclipse he reappeared upon the scene, and presently sought me out in the\ncharacter of a generous editor.  It is in this part that I best remember\nhim; tall, slender, with a not ungraceful stoop; looking quite like a\nrefined gentleman, and quite like an urbane adventurer; smiling with an\nengaging ambiguity; cocking at you one peaked eyebrow with a great\nappearance of finesse; speaking low and sweet and thick, with a touch of\nburr; telling strange tales with singular deliberation and, to a patient\nlistener, excellent effect.  After all these ups and downs, he seemed\nstill, like the rich student that he was of yore, to breathe of money;\nseemed still perfectly sure of himself and certain of his end.  Yet he\nwas then upon the brink of his last overthrow.  He had set himself to\nfound the strangest thing in our society: one of those periodical sheets\nfrom which men suppose themselves to learn opinions; in which young\ngentlemen from the universities are encouraged, at so much a line, to\ngarble facts, insult foreign nations and calumniate private individuals;\nand which are now the source of glory, so that if a man’s name be often\nenough printed there, he becomes a kind of demigod; and people will\npardon him when he talks back and forth, as they do for Mr. Gladstone;\nand crowd him to suffocation on railway platforms, as they did the other\nday to General Boulanger; and buy his literary works, as I hope you have\njust done for me.  Our fathers, when they were upon some great\nenterprise, would sacrifice a life; building, it may be, a favourite\nslave into the foundations of their palace.  It was with his own life\nthat my companion disarmed the envy of the gods.  He fought his paper\nsingle-handed; trusting no one, for he was something of a cynic; up early\nand down late, for he was nothing of a sluggard; daily ear-wigging\ninfluential men, for he was a master of ingratiation.  In that slender\nand silken fellow there must have been a rare vein of courage, that he\nshould thus have died at his employment; and doubtless ambition spoke\nloudly in his ear, and doubtless love also, for it seems there was a\nmarriage in his view had he succeeded.  But he died, and his paper died\nafter him; and of all this grace, and tact, and courage, it must seem to\nour blind eyes as if there had come literally nothing.\n\nThese three students sat, as I was saying, in the corridor, under the\nmural tablet that records the virtues of Macbean, the former secretary.\nWe would often smile at that ineloquent memorial and thought it a poor\nthing to come into the world at all and have no more behind one than\nMacbean.  And yet of these three, two are gone and have left less; and\nthis book, perhaps, when it is old and foxy, and some one picks it up in\na corner of a book-shop, and glances through it, smiling at the old,\ngraceless turns of speech, and perhaps for the love of _Alma Mater_\n(which may be still extant and flourishing) buys it, not without\nhaggling, for some pence—this book may alone preserve a memory of James\nWalter Ferrier and Robert Glasgow Brown.\n\nTheir thoughts ran very differently on that December morning; they were\nall on fire with ambition; and when they had called me in to them, and\nmade me a sharer in their design, I too became drunken with pride and\nhope.  We were to found a University magazine.  A pair of little, active\nbrothers—Livingstone by name, great skippers on the foot, great rubbers\nof the hands, who kept a book-shop over against the University\nbuilding—had been debauched to play the part of publishers.  We four were\nto be conjunct editors and, what was the main point of the concern, to\nprint our own works; while, by every rule of arithmetic—that flatterer of\ncredulity—the adventure must succeed and bring great profit.  Well, well:\nit was a bright vision.  I went home that morning walking upon air.  To\nhave been chosen by these three distinguished students was to me the most\nunspeakable advance; it was my first draught of consideration; it\nreconciled me to myself and to my fellow-men; and as I steered round the\nrailings at the Tron, I could not withhold my lips from smiling publicly.\nYet, in the bottom of my heart, I knew that magazine would be a grim\nfiasco; I knew it would not be worth reading; I knew, even if it were,\nthat nobody would read it; and I kept wondering how I should be able,\nupon my compact income of twelve pounds per annum, payable monthly, to\nmeet my share in the expense.  It was a comfortable thought to me that I\nhad a father.\n\nThe magazine appeared, in a yellow cover, which was the best part of it,\nfor at least it was unassuming; it ran four months in undisturbed\nobscurity, and died without a gasp.  The first number was edited by all\nfour of us with prodigious bustle; the second fell principally into the\nhands of Ferrier and me; the third I edited alone; and it has long been a\nsolemn question who it was that edited the fourth.  It would perhaps be\nstill more difficult to say who read it.  Poor yellow sheet, that looked\nso hopefully Livingtones’ window!  Poor, harmless paper, that might have\ngone to print a _Shakespeare_ on, and was instead so clumsily defaced\nwith nonsense; And, shall I say, Poor Editors?  I cannot pity myself, to\nwhom it was all pure gain.  It was no news to me, but only the wholesome\nconfirmation of my judgment, when the magazine struggled into half-birth,\nand instantly sickened and subsided into night.  I had sent a copy to the\nlady with whom my heart was at that time somewhat engaged, and who did\nall that in her lay to break it; and she, with some tact, passed over the\ngift and my cherished contributions in silence.  I will not say that I\nwas pleased at this; but I will tell her now, if by any chance she takes\nup the work of her former servant, that I thought the better of her\ntaste.  I cleared the decks after this lost engagement; had the necessary\ninterview with my father, which passed off not amiss; paid over my share\nof the expense to the two little, active brothers, who rubbed their hands\nas much, but methought skipped rather less than formerly, having perhaps,\nthese two also, embarked upon the enterprise with some graceful\nillusions; and then, reviewing the whole episode, I told myself that the\ntime was not yet ripe, nor the man ready; and to work I went again with\nmy penny version-books, having fallen back in one day from the printed\nauthor to the manuscript student.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nFrom this defunct periodical I am going to reprint one of my own papers.\nThe poor little piece is all tail-foremost.  I have done my best to\nstraighten its array, I have pruned it fearlessly, and it remains\ninvertebrate and wordy.  No self-respecting magazine would print the\nthing; and here you behold it in a bound volume, not for any worth of its\nown, but for the sake of the man whom it purports dimly to represent and\nsome of whose sayings it preserves; so that in this volume of Memories\nand Portraits, Robert Young, the Swanston gardener, may stand alongside\nof John Todd, the Swanston shepherd.  Not that John and Robert drew very\nclose together in their lives; for John was rough, he smelt of the windy\nbrae; and Robert was gentle, and smacked of the garden in the hollow.\nPerhaps it is to my shame that I liked John the better of the two; he had\ngrit and dash, and that salt of the Old Adam that pleases men with any\nsavage inheritance of blood; and he was a way-farer besides, and took my\ngipsy fancy.  But however that may be, and however Robert’s profile may\nbe blurred in the boyish sketch that follows, he was a man of a most\nquaint and beautiful nature, whom, if it were possible to recast a piece\nof work so old, I should like well to draw again with a maturer touch.\nAnd as I think of him and of John, I wonder in what other country two\nsuch men would be found dwelling together, in a hamlet of some twenty\ncottages, in the woody fold of a green hill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. AN OLD SCOTCH GARDENER\n\n\nI think I might almost have said the last: somewhere, indeed, in the\nuttermost glens of the Lammermuir or among the southwestern hills there\nmay yet linger a decrepid representative of this bygone good fellowship;\nbut as far as actual experience goes, I have only met one man in my life\nwho might fitly be quoted in the same breath with Andrew\nFairservice,—though without his vices.  He was a man whose very presence\ncould impart a savour of quaint antiquity to the baldest and most modern\nflower-plots.  There was a dignity about his tall stooping form, and an\nearnestness in his wrinkled face that recalled Don Quixote; but a Don\nQuixote who had come through the training of the Covenant, and been\nnourished in his youth on _Walker’s Lives_ and _The Hind let Loose_.\n\nNow, as I could not bear to let such a man pass away with no sketch\npreserved of his old-fashioned virtues, I hope the reader will take this\nas an excuse for the present paper, and judge as kindly as he can the\ninfirmities of my description.  To me, who find it so difficult to tell\nthe little that I know, he stands essentially as a _genius loci_.  It is\nimpossible to separate his spare form and old straw hat from the garden\nin the lap of the hill, with its rocks overgrown with clematis, its\nshadowy walks, and the splendid breadth of champaign that one saw from\nthe north-west corner.  The garden and gardener seem part and parcel of\neach other.  When I take him from his right surroundings and try to make\nhim appear for me on paper, he looks unreal and phantasmal: the best that\nI can say may convey some notion to those that never saw him, but to me\nit will be ever impotent.\n\nThe first time that I saw him, I fancy Robert was pretty old already: he\nhad certainly begun to use his years as a stalking horse.  Latterly he\nwas beyond all the impudencies of logic, considering a reference to the\nparish register worth all the reasons in the world, “_I am old and well\nstricken in years_,” he was wont to say; and I never found any one bold\nenough to answer the argument.  Apart from this vantage that he kept over\nall who were not yet octogenarian, he had some other drawbacks as a\ngardener.  He shrank the very place he cultivated.  The dignity and\nreduced gentility of his appearance made the small garden cut a sorry\nfigure.  He was full of tales of greater situations in his younger days.\nHe spoke of castles and parks with a humbling familiarity.  He told of\nplaces where under-gardeners had trembled at his looks, where there were\nmeres and swanneries, labyrinths of walk and wildernesses of sad\nshrubbery in his control, till you could not help feeling that it was\ncondescension on his part to dress your humbler garden plots.  You were\nthrown at once into an invidious position.  You felt that you were\nprofiting by the needs of dignity, and that his poverty and not his will\nconsented to your vulgar rule.  Involuntarily you compared yourself with\nthe swineherd that made Alfred watch his cakes, or some bloated citizen\nwho may have given his sons and his condescension to the fallen\nDionysius.  Nor were the disagreeables purely fanciful and metaphysical,\nfor the sway that he exercised over your feelings he extended to your\ngarden, and, through the garden, to your diet.  He would trim a hedge,\nthrow away a favourite plant, or fill the most favoured and fertile\nsection of the garden with a vegetable that none of us could eat, in\nsupreme contempt for our opinion.  If you asked him to send you in one of\nyour own artichokes, “_That I wull_, _mem_,” he would say, “_with\npleasure_, _for it is mair blessed to give than to receive_.”  Ay, and\neven when, by extra twisting of the screw, we prevailed on him to prefer\nour commands to his own inclination, and he went away, stately and sad,\nprofessing that “_our wull was his pleasure_,” but yet reminding us that\nhe would do it “_with feelin’s_,”—even then, I say, the triumphant master\nfelt humbled in his triumph, felt that he ruled on sufferance only, that\nhe was taking a mean advantage of the other’s low estate, and that the\nwhole scene had been one of those “slights that patient merit of the\nunworthy takes.”\n\nIn flowers his taste was old-fashioned and catholic; affecting sunflowers\nand dahlias, wallflowers and roses and holding in supreme aversion\nwhatsoever was fantastic, new-fashioned or wild.  There was one exception\nto this sweeping ban.  Foxgloves, though undoubtedly guilty on the last\ncount, he not only spared, but loved; and when the shrubbery was being\nthinned, he stayed his hand and dexterously manipulated his bill in order\nto save every stately stem.  In boyhood, as he told me once, speaking in\nthat tone that only actors and the old-fashioned common folk can use\nnowadays, his heart grew “_proud_” within him when he came on a\nburn-course among the braes of Manor that shone purple with their\ngraceful trophies; and not all his apprenticeship and practice for so\nmany years of precise gardening had banished these boyish recollections\nfrom his heart.  Indeed, he was a man keenly alive to the beauty of all\nthat was bygone.  He abounded in old stories of his boyhood, and kept\npious account of all his former pleasures; and when he went (on a\nholiday) to visit one of the fabled great places of the earth where he\nhad served before, he came back full of little pre-Raphaelite\nreminiscences that showed real passion for the past, such as might have\nshaken hands with Hazlitt or Jean-Jacques.\n\nBut however his sympathy with his old feelings might affect his liking\nfor the foxgloves, the very truth was that he scorned all flowers\ntogether.  They were but garnishings, childish toys, trifling ornaments\nfor ladies’ chimney-shelves.  It was towards his cauliflowers and peas\nand cabbage that his heart grew warm.  His preference for the more useful\ngrowths was such that cabbages were found invading the flower-pots, and\nan outpost of savoys was once discovered in the centre of the lawn.  He\nwould prelect over some thriving plant with wonderful enthusiasm, piling\nreminiscence on reminiscence of former and perhaps yet finer specimens.\nYet even then he did not let the credit leave himself.  He had, indeed,\nraised “_finer o’ them_;” but it seemed that no one else had been\nfavoured with a like success.  All other gardeners, in fact, were mere\nfoils to his own superior attainments; and he would recount, with perfect\nsoberness of voice and visage, how so and so had wondered, and such\nanother could scarcely give credit to his eyes.  Nor was it with his\nrivals only that he parted praise and blame.  If you remarked how well a\nplant was looking, he would gravely touch his hat and thank you with\nsolemn unction; all credit in the matter falling to him.  If, on the\nother hand, you called his attention to some back-going vegetable, he\nwould quote Scripture: “_Paul may plant and Apollos may water_;” all\nblame being left to Providence, on the score of deficient rain or\nuntimely frosts.\n\nThere was one thing in the garden that shared his preference with his\nfavourite cabbages and rhubarb, and that other was the beehive.  Their\nsound, their industry, perhaps their sweet product also, had taken hold\nof his imagination and heart, whether by way of memory or no I cannot\nsay, although perhaps the bees too were linked to him by some\nrecollection of Manor braes and his country childhood.  Nevertheless, he\nwas too chary of his personal safety or (let me rather say) his personal\ndignity to mingle in any active office towards them.  But he could stand\nby while one of the contemned rivals did the work for him, and protest\nthat it was quite safe in spite of his own considerate distance and the\ncries of the distressed assistant.  In regard to bees, he was rather a\nman of word than deed, and some of his most striking sentences had the\nbees for text.  “_They are indeed wonderfu’ creatures_, _mem_,” he said\nonce.  “_They just mind me o’ what the Queen of Sheba said to Solomon—and\nI think she said it wi’ a sigh_,—‘_The half of it hath not been told unto\nme_.’”\n\nAs far as the Bible goes, he was deeply read.  Like the old Covenanters,\nof whom he was the worthy representative, his mouth was full of sacred\nquotations; it was the book that he had studied most and thought upon\nmost deeply.  To many people in his station the Bible, and perhaps Burns,\nare the only books of any vital literary merit that they read, feeding\nthemselves, for the rest, on the draff of country newspapers, and the\nvery instructive but not very palatable pabulum of some cheap educational\nseries.  This was Robert’s position.  All day long he had dreamed of the\nHebrew stories, and his head had been full of Hebrew poetry and Gospel\nethics; until they had struck deep root into his heart, and the very\nexpressions had become a part of him; so that he rarely spoke without\nsome antique idiom or Scripture mannerism that gave a raciness to the\nmerest trivialities of talk.  But the influence of the Bible did not stop\nhere.  There was more in Robert than quaint phrase and ready store of\nreference.  He was imbued with a spirit of peace and love: he interposed\nbetween man and wife: he threw himself between the angry, touching his\nhat the while with all the ceremony of an usher: he protected the birds\nfrom everybody but himself, seeing, I suppose, a great difference between\nofficial execution and wanton sport.  His mistress telling him one day to\nput some ferns into his master’s particular corner, and adding, “Though,\nindeed, Robert, he doesn’t deserve them, for he wouldn’t help me to\ngather them,” “_Eh_, _mem_,” replies Robert, “_But I wouldnae say that_,\n_for I think he’s just a most deservin’ gentleman_.”  Again, two of our\nfriends, who were on intimate terms, and accustomed to use language to\neach other, somewhat without the bounds of the parliamentary, happened to\ndiffer about the position of a seat in the garden.  The discussion, as\nwas usual when these two were at it, soon waxed tolerably insulting on\nboth sides.  Every one accustomed to such controversies several times a\nday was quietly enjoying this prize-fight of somewhat abusive wit—every\none but Robert, to whom the perfect good faith of the whole quarrel\nseemed unquestionable, and who, after having waited till his conscience\nwould suffer him to wait no more, and till he expected every moment that\nthe disputants would fall to blows, cut suddenly in with tones of almost\ntearful entreaty: “_Eh_, _but_, _gentlemen_, _I wad hae nae mair words\nabout it_!”  One thing was noticeable about Robert’s religion: it was\nneither dogmatic nor sectarian.  He never expatiated (at least, in my\nhearing) on the doctrines of his creed, and he never condemned anybody\nelse.  I have no doubt that he held all Roman Catholics, Atheists, and\nMahometans as considerably out of it; I don’t believe he had any sympathy\nfor Prelacy; and the natural feelings of man must have made him a little\nsore about Free-Churchism; but at least, he never talked about these\nviews, never grew controversially noisy, and never openly aspersed the\nbelief or practice of anybody.  Now all this is not generally\ncharacteristic of Scotch piety; Scotch sects being churches militant with\na vengeance, and Scotch believers perpetual crusaders the one against the\nother, and missionaries the one to the other.  Perhaps Robert’s\noriginally tender heart was what made the difference; or, perhaps, his\nsolitary and pleasant labour among fruits and flowers had taught him a\nmore sunshiny creed than those whose work is among the tares of fallen\nhumanity; and the soft influences of the garden had entered deep into his\nspirit,\n\n    “Annihilating all that’s made\n    To a green thought in a green shade.”\n\nBut I could go on for ever chronicling his golden sayings or telling of\nhis innocent and living piety.  I had meant to tell of his cottage, with\nthe German pipe hung reverently above the fire, and the shell box that he\nhad made for his son, and of which he would say pathetically:  “_He was\nreal pleased wi’ it at first_, _but I think he’s got a kind o’ tired o’\nit now_”—the son being then a man of about forty.  But I will let all\nthese pass.  “’Tis more significant: he’s dead.”  The earth, that he had\ndigged so much in his life, was dug out by another for himself; and the\nflowers that he had tended drew their life still from him, but in a new\nand nearer way.  A bird flew about the open grave, as if it too wished to\nhonour the obsequies of one who had so often quoted Scripture in favour\nof its kind.  “Are not two sparrows sold for one farthing, and yet not\none of them falleth to the ground.”\n\nYes, he is dead.  But the kings did not rise in the place of death to\ngreet him “with taunting proverbs” as they rose to greet the haughty\nBabylonian; for in his life he was lowly, and a peacemaker and a servant\nof God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. PASTORAL\n\n\nTo leave home in early life is to be stunned and quickened with\nnovelties; but when years have come, it only casts a more endearing light\nupon the past.  As in those composite photographs of Mr. Galton’s, the\nimage of each new sitter brings out but the more clearly the central\nfeatures of the race; when once youth has flown, each new impression only\ndeepens the sense of nationality and the desire of native places.  So may\nsome cadet of Royal Écossais or the Albany Regiment, as he mounted guard\nabout French citadels, so may some officer marching his company of the\nScots-Dutch among the polders, have felt the soft rains of the Hebrides\nupon his brow, or started in the ranks at the remembered aroma of\npeat-smoke.  And the rivers of home are dear in particular to all men.\nThis is as old as Naaman, who was jealous for Abana and Pharpar; it is\nconfined to no race nor country, for I know one of Scottish blood but a\nchild of Suffolk, whose fancy still lingers about the lilied lowland\nwaters of that shire.  But the streams of Scotland are incomparable in\nthemselves—or I am only the more Scottish to suppose so—and their sound\nand colour dwell for ever in the memory.  How often and willingly do I\nnot look again in fancy on Tummel, or Manor, or the talking Airdle, or\nDee swirling in its Lynn; on the bright burn of Kinnaird, or the golden\nburn that pours and sulks in the den behind Kingussie!  I think shame to\nleave out one of these enchantresses, but the list would grow too long if\nI remembered all; only I may not forget Allan Water, nor birch-wetting\nRogie, nor yet Almond; nor, for all its pollutions, that Water of Leith\nof the many and well-named mills—Bell’s Mills, and Canon Mills, and\nSilver Mills; nor Redford Burn of pleasant memories; nor yet, for all its\nsmallness, that nameless trickle that springs in the green bosom of\nAllermuir, and is fed from Halkerside with a perennial teacupful, and\nthreads the moss under the Shearer’s Knowe, and makes one pool there,\noverhung by a rock, where I loved to sit and make bad verses, and is then\nkidnapped in its infancy by subterranean pipes for the service of the\nsea-beholding city in the plain.  From many points in the moss you may\nsee at one glance its whole course and that of all its tributaries; the\ngeographer of this Lilliput may visit all its corners without sitting\ndown, and not yet begin to be breathed; Shearer’s Knowe and Halkerside\nare but names of adjacent cantons on a single shoulder of a hill, as\nnames are squandered (it would seem to the in-expert, in superfluity)\nupon these upland sheepwalks; a bucket would receive the whole discharge\nof the toy river; it would take it an appreciable time to fill your\nmorning bath; for the most part, besides, it soaks unseen through the\nmoss; and yet for the sake of auld lang syne, and the figure of a certain\n_genius loci_, I am condemned to linger awhile in fancy by its shores;\nand if the nymph (who cannot be above a span in stature) will but inspire\nmy pen, I would gladly carry the reader along with me.\n\nJohn Todd, when I knew him, was already “the oldest herd on the\nPentlands,” and had been all his days faithful to that curlew-scattering,\nsheep-collecting life.  He remembered the droving days, when the drove\nroads, that now lie green and solitary through the heather, were thronged\nthoroughfares.  He had himself often marched flocks into England,\nsleeping on the hillsides with his caravan; and by his account it was a\nrough business not without danger.  The drove roads lay apart from\nhabitation; the drovers met in the wilderness, as to-day the deep-sea\nfishers meet off the banks in the solitude of the Atlantic; and in the\none as in the other case rough habits and fist-law were the rule.  Crimes\nwere committed, sheep filched, and drovers robbed and beaten; most of\nwhich offences had a moorland burial and were never heard of in the\ncourts of justice.  John, in those days, was at least once attacked,—by\ntwo men after his watch,—and at least once, betrayed by his habitual\nanger, fell under the danger of the law and was clapped into some rustic\nprison-house, the doors of which he burst in the night and was no more\nheard of in that quarter.  When I knew him, his life had fallen in\nquieter places, and he had no cares beyond the dulness of his dogs and\nthe inroads of pedestrians from town.  But for a man of his propensity to\nwrath these were enough; he knew neither rest nor peace, except by\nsnatches; in the gray of the summer morning, and already from far up the\nhill, he would wake the “toun” with the sound of his shoutings; and in\nthe lambing time, his cries were not yet silenced late at night.  This\nwrathful voice of a man unseen might be said to haunt that quarter of the\nPentlands, an audible bogie; and no doubt it added to the fear in which\nmen stood of John a touch of something legendary.  For my own part, he\nwas at first my enemy, and I, in my character of a rambling boy, his\nnatural abhorrence.  It was long before I saw him near at hand, knowing\nhim only by some sudden blast of bellowing from far above, bidding me\n“c’way oot amang the sheep.”  The quietest recesses of the hill harboured\nthis ogre; I skulked in my favourite wilderness like a Cameronian of the\nKilling Time, and John Todd was my Claverhouse, and his dogs my questing\ndragoons.  Little by little we dropped into civilities; his hail at sight\nof me began to have less of the ring of a war-slogan; soon, we never met\nbut he produced his snuff-box, which was with him, like the calumet with\nthe Red Indian, a part of the heraldry of peace; and at length, in the\nripeness of time, we grew to be a pair of friends, and when I lived alone\nin these parts in the winter, it was a settled thing for John to “give me\na cry” over the garden wall as he set forth upon his evening round, and\nfor me to overtake and bear him company.\n\nThat dread voice of his that shook the hills when he was angry, fell in\nordinary talk very pleasantly upon the ear, with a kind of honied,\nfriendly whine, not far off singing, that was eminently Scottish.  He\nlaughed not very often, and when he did, with a sudden, loud haw-haw,\nhearty but somehow joyless, like an echo from a rock.  His face was\npermanently set and coloured; ruddy and stiff with weathering; more like\na picture than a face; yet with a certain strain and a threat of latent\nanger in the expression, like that of a man trained too fine and harassed\nwith perpetual vigilance.  He spoke in the richest dialect of Scotch I\never heard; the words in themselves were a pleasure and often a surprise\nto me, so that I often came back from one of our patrols with new\nacquisitions; and this vocabulary he would handle like a master, stalking\na little before me, “beard on shoulder,” the plaid hanging loosely about\nhim, the yellow staff clapped under his arm, and guiding me uphill by\nthat devious, tactical ascent which seems peculiar to men of his trade.\nI might count him with the best talkers; only that talking Scotch and\ntalking English seem incomparable acts.  He touched on nothing at least,\nbut he adorned it; when he narrated, the scene was before you; when he\nspoke (as he did mostly) of his own antique business, the thing took on a\ncolour of romance and curiosity that was surprising.  The clans of sheep\nwith their particular territories on the hill, and how, in the yearly\nkillings and purchases, each must be proportionally thinned and\nstrengthened; the midnight busyness of animals, the signs of the weather,\nthe cares of the snowy season, the exquisite stupidity of sheep, the\nexquisite cunning of dogs: all these he could present so humanly, and\nwith so much old experience and living gusto, that weariness was\nexcluded.  And in the midst he would suddenly straighten his bowed back,\nthe stick would fly abroad in demonstration, and the sharp thunder of his\nvoice roll out a long itinerary for the dogs, so that you saw at last the\nuse of that great wealth of names for every knowe and howe upon the\nhillside; and the dogs, having hearkened with lowered tails and raised\nfaces, would run up their flags again to the masthead and spread\nthemselves upon the indicated circuit.  It used to fill me with wonder\nhow they could follow and retain so long a story.  But John denied these\ncreatures all intelligence; they were the constant butt of his passion\nand contempt; it was just possible to work with the like of them, he\nsaid,—not more than possible.  And then he would expand upon the subject\nof the really good dogs that he had known, and the one really good dog\nthat he had himself possessed.  He had been offered forty pounds for it;\nbut a good collie was worth more than that, more than anything, to a\n“herd;” he did the herd’s work for him.  “As for the like of them!” he\nwould cry, and scornfully indicate the scouring tails of his assistants.\n\nOnce—I translate John’s Lallan, for I cannot do it justice, being born\n_Britannis in montibus_, indeed, but alas! _inerudito sæculo_—once, in\nthe days of his good dog, he had bought some sheep in Edinburgh, and on\nthe way out, the road being crowded, two were lost.  This was a reproach\nto John, and a slur upon the dog; and both were alive to their\nmisfortune.  Word came, after some days, that a farmer about Braid had\nfound a pair of sheep; and thither went John and the dog to ask for\nrestitution.  But the farmer was a hard man and stood upon his rights.\n“How were they marked?” he asked; and since John had bought right and\nleft from many sellers and had no notion of the marks—“Very well,” said\nthe farmer, “then it’s only right that I should keep them.”—“Well,” said\nJohn, “it’s a fact that I cannae tell the sheep; but if my dog can, will\nye let me have them?”  The farmer was honest as well as hard, and besides\nI daresay he had little fear of the ordeal; so he had all the sheep upon\nhis farm into one large park, and turned John’s dog into their midst.\nThat hairy man of business knew his errand well; he knew that John and he\nhad bought two sheep and (to their shame) lost them about\nBoroughmuirhead; he knew besides (the lord knows how, unless by\nlistening) that they were come to Braid for their recovery; and without\npause or blunder singled out, first one and then another, the two waifs.\nIt was that afternoon the forty pounds were offered and refused.  And the\nshepherd and his dog—what do I say? the true shepherd and his man—set off\ntogether by Fairmilehead in jocund humour, and “smiled to ither” all the\nway home, with the two recovered ones before them.  So far, so good; but\nintelligence may be abused.  The dog, as he is by little man’s inferior\nin mind, is only by little his superior in virtue; and John had another\ncollie tale of quite a different complexion.  At the foot of the moss\nbehind Kirk Yetton (Caer Ketton, wise men say) there is a scrog of low\nwood and a pool with a dam for washing sheep.  John was one day lying\nunder a bush in the scrog, when he was aware of a collie on the far\nhillside skulking down through the deepest of the heather with obtrusive\nstealth.  He knew the dog; knew him for a clever, rising practitioner\nfrom quite a distant farm; one whom perhaps he had coveted as he saw him\nmasterfully steering flocks to market.  But what did the practitioner so\nfar from home? and why this guilty and secret manoeuvring towards the\npool?—for it was towards the pool that he was heading.  John lay the\ncloser under his bush, and presently saw the dog come forth upon the\nmargin, look all about him to see if he were anywhere observed, plunge in\nand repeatedly wash himself over head and ears, and then (but now openly\nand with tail in air) strike homeward over the hills.  That same night\nword was sent his master, and the rising practitioner, shaken up from\nwhere he lay, all innocence, before the fire, was had out to a dykeside\nand promptly shot; for alas! he was that foulest of criminals under\ntrust, a sheep-eater; and it was from the maculation of sheep’s blood\nthat he had come so far to cleanse himself in the pool behind Kirk\nYetton.\n\nA trade that touches nature, one that lies at the foundations of life, in\nwhich we have all had ancestors employed, so that on a hint of it\nancestral memories revive, lends itself to literary use, vocal or\nwritten.  The fortune of a tale lies not alone in the skill of him that\nwrites, but as much, perhaps, in the inherited experience of him who\nreads; and when I hear with a particular thrill of things that I have\nnever done or seen, it is one of that innumerable army of my ancestors\nrejoicing in past deeds.  Thus novels begin to touch not the fine\n_dilettanti_ but the gross mass of mankind, when they leave off to speak\nof parlours and shades of manner and still-born niceties of motive, and\nbegin to deal with fighting, sailoring, adventure, death or childbirth;\nand thus ancient outdoor crafts and occupations, whether Mr. Hardy wields\nthe shepherd’s crook or Count Tolstoi swings the scythe, lift romance\ninto a near neighbourhood with epic.  These aged things have on them the\ndew of man’s morning; they lie near, not so much to us, the\nsemi-artificial flowerets, as to the trunk and aboriginal taproot of the\nrace.  A thousand interests spring up in the process of the ages, and a\nthousand perish; that is now an eccentricity or a lost art which was once\nthe fashion of an empire; and those only are perennial matters that rouse\nus to-day, and that roused men in all epochs of the past.  There is a\ncertain critic, not indeed of execution but of matter, whom I dare be\nknown to set before the best: a certain low-browed, hairy gentleman, at\nfirst a percher in the fork of trees, next (as they relate) a dweller in\ncaves, and whom I think I see squatting in cave-mouths, of a pleasant\nafternoon, to munch his berries—his wife, that accomplished lady,\nsquatting by his side: his name I never heard, but he is often described\nas Probably Arboreal, which may serve for recognition.  Each has his own\ntree of ancestors, but at the top of all sits Probably Arboreal; in all\nour veins there run some minims of his old, wild, tree-top blood; our\ncivilised nerves still tingle with his rude terrors and pleasures; and to\nthat which would have moved our common ancestor, all must obediently\nthrill.\n\nWe have not so far to climb to come to shepherds; and it may be I had one\nfor an ascendant who has largely moulded me.  But yet I think I owe my\ntaste for that hillside business rather to the art and interest of John\nTodd.  He it was that made it live for me, as the artist can make all\nthings live.  It was through him the simple strategy of massing sheep\nupon a snowy evening, with its attendant scampering of earnest, shaggy\naides-de-camp, was an affair that I never wearied of seeing, and that I\nnever weary of recalling to mind: the shadow of the night darkening on\nthe hills, inscrutable black blots of snow shower moving here and there\nlike night already come, huddles of yellow sheep and dartings of black\ndogs upon the snow, a bitter air that took you by the throat, unearthly\nharpings of the wind along the moors; and for centre piece to all these\nfeatures and influences, John winding up the brae, keeping his captain’s\neye upon all sides, and breaking, ever and again, into a spasm of\nbellowing that seemed to make the evening bleaker.  It is thus that I\nstill see him in my mind’s eye, perched on a hump of the declivity not\nfar from Halkerside, his staff in airy flourish, his great voice taking\nhold upon the hills and echoing terror to the lowlands; I, meanwhile,\nstanding somewhat back, until the fit should be over, and, with a pinch\nof snuff, my friend relapse into his easy, even conversation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE MANSE\n\n\nI have named, among many rivers that make music in my memory, that dirty\nWater of Leith.  Often and often I desire to look upon it again; and the\nchoice of a point of view is easy to me.  It should be at a certain\nwater-door, embowered in shrubbery.  The river is there dammed back for\nthe service of the flour-mill just below, so that it lies deep and\ndarkling, and the sand slopes into brown obscurity with a glint of gold;\nand it has but newly been recruited by the borrowings of the snuff-mill\njust above, and these, tumbling merrily in, shake the pool to its black\nheart, fill it with drowsy eddies, and set the curded froth of many other\nmills solemnly steering to and fro upon the surface.  Or so it was when I\nwas young; for change, and the masons, and the pruning-knife, have been\nbusy; and if I could hope to repeat a cherished experience, it must be on\nmany and impossible conditions.  I must choose, as well as the point of\nview, a certain moment in my growth, so that the scale may be\nexaggerated, and the trees on the steep opposite side may seem to climb\nto heaven, and the sand by the water-door, where I am standing, seem as\nlow as Styx.  And I must choose the season also, so that the valley may\nbe brimmed like a cup with sunshine and the songs of birds;—and the year\nof grace, so that when I turn to leave the riverside I may find the old\nmanse and its inhabitants unchanged.\n\nIt was a place in that time like no other: the garden cut into provinces\nby a great hedge of beech, and over-looked by the church and the terrace\nof the churchyard, where the tombstones were thick, and after nightfall\n“spunkies” might be seen to dance at least by children; flower-plots\nlying warm in sunshine; laurels and the great yew making elsewhere a\npleasing horror of shade; the smell of water rising from all round, with\nan added tang of paper-mills; the sound of water everywhere, and the\nsound of mills—the wheel and the dam singing their alternate strain; the\nbirds on every bush and from every corner of the overhanging woods\npealing out their notes until the air throbbed with them; and in the\nmidst of this, the manse.  I see it, by the standard of my childish\nstature, as a great and roomy house.  In truth, it was not so large as I\nsupposed, nor yet so convenient, and, standing where it did, it is\ndifficult to suppose that it was healthful.  Yet a large family of\nstalwart sons and tall daughters were housed and reared, and came to man\nand womanhood in that nest of little chambers; so that the face of the\nearth was peppered with the children of the manse, and letters with\noutlandish stamps became familiar to the local postman, and the walls of\nthe little chambers brightened with the wonders of the East.  The dullest\ncould see this was a house that had a pair of hands in divers foreign\nplaces: a well-beloved house—its image fondly dwelt on by many\ntravellers.\n\nHere lived an ancestor of mine, who was a herd of men.  I read him,\njudging with older criticism the report of childish observation, as a man\nof singular simplicity of nature; unemotional, and hating the display of\nwhat he felt; standing contented on the old ways; a lover of his life and\ninnocent habits to the end.  We children admired him: partly for his\nbeautiful face and silver hair, for none more than children are concerned\nfor beauty and, above all, for beauty in the old; partly for the solemn\nlight in which we beheld him once a week, the observed of all observers,\nin the pulpit.  But his strictness and distance, the effect, I now fancy,\nof old age, slow blood, and settled habit, oppressed us with a kind of\nterror.  When not abroad, he sat much alone, writing sermons or letters\nto his scattered family in a dark and cold room with a library of\nbloodless books—or so they seemed in those days, although I have some of\nthem now on my own shelves and like well enough to read them; and these\nlonely hours wrapped him in the greater gloom for our imaginations.  But\nthe study had a redeeming grace in many Indian pictures, gaudily coloured\nand dear to young eyes.  I cannot depict (for I have no such passions\nnow) the greed with which I beheld them; and when I was once sent in to\nsay a psalm to my grandfather, I went, quaking indeed with fear, but at\nthe same time glowing with hope that, if I said it well, he might reward\nme with an Indian picture.\n\n    “Thy foot He’ll not let slide, nor will\n       He slumber that thee keeps,”\n\nit ran: a strange conglomerate of the unpronounceable, a sad model to set\nin childhood before one who was himself to be a versifier, and a task in\nrecitation that really merited reward.  And I must suppose the old man\nthought so too, and was either touched or amused by the performance; for\nhe took me in his arms with most unwonted tenderness, and kissed me, and\ngave me a little kindly sermon for my psalm; so that, for that day, we\nwere clerk and parson.  I was struck by this reception into so tender a\nsurprise that I forgot my disappointment.  And indeed the hope was one of\nthose that childhood forges for a pastime, and with no design upon\nreality.  Nothing was more unlikely than that my grandfather should strip\nhimself of one of those pictures, love-gifts and reminders of his absent\nsons; nothing more unlikely than that he should bestow it upon me.  He\nhad no idea of spoiling children, leaving all that to my aunt; he had\nfared hard himself, and blubbered under the rod in the last century; and\nhis ways were still Spartan for the young.  The last word I heard upon\nhis lips was in this Spartan key.  He had over-walked in the teeth of an\neast wind, and was now near the end of his many days.  He sat by the\ndining-room fire, with his white hair, pale face and bloodshot eyes, a\nsomewhat awful figure; and my aunt had given him a dose of our good old\nScotch medicine, Dr. Gregory’s powder.  Now that remedy, as the work of a\nnear kinsman of Rob Roy himself, may have a savour of romance for the\nimagination; but it comes uncouthly to the palate.  The old gentleman had\ntaken it with a wry face; and that being accomplished, sat with perfect\nsimplicity, like a child’s, munching a “barley-sugar kiss.”  But when my\naunt, having the canister open in her hands, proposed to let me share in\nthe sweets, he interfered at once.  I had had no Gregory; then I should\nhave no barley-sugar kiss: so he decided with a touch of irritation.  And\njust then the phaeton coming opportunely to the kitchen door—for such was\nour unlordly fashion—I was taken for the last time from the presence of\nmy grandfather.\n\nNow I often wonder what I have inherited from this old minister.  I must\nsuppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I,\nthough I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.\nHe sought health in his youth in the Isle of Wight, and I have sought it\nin both hemispheres; but whereas he found and kept it, I am still on the\nquest.  He was a great lover of Shakespeare, whom he read aloud, I have\nbeen told, with taste; well, I love my Shakespeare also, and am persuaded\nI can read him well, though I own I never have been told so.  He made\nembroidery, designing his own patterns; and in that kind of work I never\nmade anything but a kettle-holder in Berlin wool, and an odd garter of\nknitting, which was as black as the chimney before I had done with it.\nHe loved port, and nuts, and porter; and so do I, but they agreed better\nwith my grandfather, which seems to me a breach of contract.  He had\nchalk-stones in his fingers; and these, in good time, I may possibly\ninherit, but I would much rather have inherited his noble presence.  Try\nas I please, I cannot join myself on with the reverend doctor; and all\nthe while, no doubt, and even as I write the phrase, he moves in my\nblood, and whispers words to me, and sits efficient in the very knot and\ncentre of my being.  In his garden, as I played there, I learned the love\nof mills—or had I an ancestor a miller?—and a kindness for the\nneighbourhood of graves, as homely things not without their poetry—or had\nI an ancestor a sexton?  But what of the garden where he played\nhimself?—for that, too, was a scene of my education.  Some part of me\nplayed there in the eighteenth century, and ran races under the green\navenue at Pilrig; some part of me trudged up Leith Walk, which was still\na country place, and sat on the High School benches, and was thrashed,\nperhaps, by Dr. Adam.  The house where I spent my youth was not yet\nthought upon; but we made holiday parties among the cornfields on its\nsite, and ate strawberries and cream near by at a gardener’s.  All this I\nhad forgotten; only my grandfather remembered and once reminded me.  I\nhave forgotten, too, how we grew up, and took orders, and went to our\nfirst Ayrshire parish, and fell in love with and married a daughter of\nBurns’s Dr. Smith—“Smith opens out his cauld harangues.”  I have\nforgotten, but I was there all the same, and heard stories of Burns at\nfirst hand.\n\nAnd there is a thing stranger than all that; for this _homunculus_ or\npart-man of mine that walked about the eighteenth century with Dr.\nBalfour in his youth, was in the way of meeting other _homunculos_ or\npart-men, in the persons of my other ancestors.  These were of a lower\norder, and doubtless we looked down upon them duly.  But as I went to\ncollege with Dr. Balfour, I may have seen the lamp and oil man taking\ndown the shutters from his shop beside the Tron;—we may have had a\nrabbit-hutch or a bookshelf made for us by a certain carpenter in I know\nnot what wynd of the old, smoky city; or, upon some holiday excursion, we\nmay have looked into the windows of a cottage in a flower-garden and seen\na certain weaver plying his shuttle.  And these were all kinsmen of mine\nupon the other side; and from the eyes of the lamp and oil man one-half\nof my unborn father, and one-quarter of myself, looked out upon us as we\nwent by to college.  Nothing of all this would cross the mind of the\nyoung student, as he posted up the Bridges with trim, stockinged legs, in\nthat city of cocked hats and good Scotch still unadulterated.  It would\nnot cross his mind that he should have a daughter; and the lamp and oil\nman, just then beginning, by a not unnatural metastasis, to bloom into a\nlighthouse-engineer, should have a grandson; and that these two, in the\nfulness of time, should wed; and some portion of that student himself\nshould survive yet a year or two longer in the person of their child.\n\nBut our ancestral adventures are beyond even the arithmetic of fancy; and\nit is the chief recommendation of long pedigrees, that we can follow\nbackward the careers of our _homunculos_ and be reminded of our antenatal\nlives.  Our conscious years are but a moment in the history of the\nelements that build us.  Are you a bank-clerk, and do you live at\nPeckham?  It was not always so.  And though to-day I am only a man of\nletters, either tradition errs or I was present when there landed at St.\nAndrews a French barber-surgeon, to tend the health and the beard of the\ngreat Cardinal Beaton; I have shaken a spear in the Debateable Land and\nshouted the slogan of the Elliots; I was present when a skipper, plying\nfrom Dundee, smuggled Jacobites to France after the ’15; I was in a West\nIndia merchant’s office, perhaps next door to Bailie Nicol Jarvie’s, and\nmanaged the business of a plantation in St. Kitt’s; I was with my\nengineer-grandfather (the son-in-law of the lamp and oil man) when he\nsailed north about Scotland on the famous cruise that gave us the\n_Pirate_ and the _Lord of the Isles_; I was with him, too, on the Bell\nRock, in the fog, when the _Smeaton_ had drifted from her moorings, and\nthe Aberdeen men, pick in hand, had seized upon the only boats, and he\nmust stoop and lap sea-water before his tongue could utter audible words;\nand once more with him when the Bell Rock beacon took a “thrawe,” and his\nworkmen fled into the tower, then nearly finished, and he sat unmoved\nreading in his Bible—or affecting to read—till one after another slunk\nback with confusion of countenance to their engineer.  Yes, parts of me\nhave seen life, and met adventures, and sometimes met them well.  And\naway in the still cloudier past, the threads that make me up can be\ntraced by fancy into the bosoms of thousands and millions of ascendants:\nPicts who rallied round Macbeth and the old (and highly preferable)\nsystem of descent by females, fleërs from before the legions of Agricola,\nmarchers in Pannonian morasses, star-gazers on Chaldæan plateaus; and,\nfurthest of all, what face is this that fancy can see peering through the\ndisparted branches?  What sleeper in green tree-tops, what muncher of\nnuts, concludes my pedigree?  Probably arboreal in his habits. . . .\n\nAnd I know not which is the more strange, that I should carry about with\nme some fibres of my minister-grandfather; or that in him, as he sat in\nhis cool study, grave, reverend, contented gentleman, there was an\naboriginal frisking of the blood that was not his; tree-top memories,\nlike undeveloped negatives, lay dormant in his mind; tree-top instincts\nawoke and were trod down; and Probably Arboreal (scarce to be\ndistinguished from a monkey) gambolled and chattered in the brain of the\nold divine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. MEMOIRS OF AN ISLET\n\n\nThose who try to be artists use, time after time, the matter of their\nrecollections, setting and resetting little coloured memories of men and\nscenes, rigging up (it may be) some especial friend in the attire of a\nbuccaneer, and decreeing armies to manœuvre, or murder to be done, on the\nplayground of their youth.  But the memories are a fairy gift which\ncannot be worn out in using.  After a dozen services in various tales,\nthe little sunbright pictures of the past still shine in the mind’s eye\nwith not a lineament defaced, not a tint impaired.  _Glück und Unglück\nwird Gesang_, if Goethe pleases; yet only by endless avatars, the\noriginal re-embodying after each.  So that a writer, in time, begins to\nwonder at the perdurable life of these impressions; begins, perhaps, to\nfancy that he wrongs them when he weaves them in with fiction; and\nlooking back on them with ever-growing kindness, puts them at last,\nsubstantive jewels, in a setting of their own.\n\nOne or two of these pleasant spectres I think I have laid.  I used one\nbut the other day: a little eyot of dense, freshwater sand, where I once\nwaded deep in butterburrs, delighting to hear the song of the river on\nboth sides, and to tell myself that I was indeed and at last upon an\nisland.  Two of my puppets lay there a summer’s day, hearkening to the\nshearers at work in riverside fields and to the drums of the gray old\ngarrison upon the neighbouring hill.  And this was, I think, done\nrightly: the place was rightly peopled—and now belongs not to me but to\nmy puppets—for a time at least.  In time, perhaps, the puppets will grow\nfaint; the original memory swim up instant as ever; and I shall once more\nlie in bed, and see the little sandy isle in Allan Water as it is in\nnature, and the child (that once was me) wading there in butterburrs; and\nwonder at the instancy and virgin freshness of that memory; and be\npricked again, in season and out of season, by the desire to weave it\ninto art.\n\nThere is another isle in my collection, the memory of which besieges me.\nI put a whole family there, in one of my tales; and later on, threw upon\nits shores, and condemned to several days of rain and shellfish on its\ntumbled boulders, the hero of another.  The ink is not yet faded; the\nsound of the sentences is still in my mind’s ear; and I am under a spell\nto write of that island again.\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe little isle of Earraid lies close in to the south-west corner of the\nRoss of Mull: the sound of Iona on one side, across which you may see the\nisle and church of Columba; the open sea to the other, where you shall be\nable to mark, on a clear, surfy day, the breakers running white on many\nsunken rocks.  I first saw it, or first remembered seeing it, framed in\nthe round bull’s-eye of a cabin port, the sea lying smooth along its\nshores like the waters of a lake, the colourless clear light of the early\nmorning making plain its heathery and rocky hummocks.  There stood upon\nit, in these days, a single rude house of uncemented stones, approached\nby a pier of wreckwood.  It must have been very early, for it was then\nsummer, and in summer, in that latitude, day scarcely withdraws; but even\nat that hour the house was making a sweet smoke of peats which came to me\nover the bay, and the bare-legged daughters of the cotter were wading by\nthe pier.  The same day we visited the shores of the isle in the ship’s\nboats; rowed deep into Fiddler’s Hole, sounding as we went; and having\ntaken stock of all possible accommodation, pitched on the northern inlet\nas the scene of operations.  For it was no accident that had brought the\nlighthouse steamer to anchor in the Bay of Earraid.  Fifteen miles away\nto seaward, a certain black rock stood environed by the Atlantic rollers,\nthe outpost of the Torran reefs.  Here was a tower to be built, and a\nstar lighted, for the conduct of seamen.  But as the rock was small, and\nhard of access, and far from land, the work would be one of years; and my\nfather was now looking for a shore station, where the stones might be\nquarried and dressed, the men live, and the tender, with some degree of\nsafety, lie at anchor.\n\nI saw Earraid next from the stern thwart of an Iona lugger, Sam Bough and\nI sitting there cheek by jowl, with our feet upon our baggage, in a\nbeautiful, clear, northern summer eve.  And behold! there was now a pier\nof stone, there were rows of sheds, railways, travelling-cranes, a street\nof cottages, an iron house for the resident engineer, wooden bothies for\nthe men, a stage where the courses of the tower were put together\nexperimentally, and behind the settlement a great gash in the hillside\nwhere granite was quarried.  In the bay, the steamer lay at her moorings.\nAll day long there hung about the place the music of chinking tools; and\neven in the dead of night, the watchman carried his lantern to and fro in\nthe dark settlement and could light the pipe of any midnight muser.  It\nwas, above all, strange to see Earraid on the Sunday, when the sound of\nthe tools ceased and there fell a crystal quiet.  All about the green\ncompound men would be sauntering in their Sunday’s best, walking with\nthose lax joints of the reposing toiler, thoughtfully smoking, talking\nsmall, as if in honour of the stillness, or hearkening to the wailing of\nthe gulls.  And it was strange to see our Sabbath services, held, as they\nwere, in one of the bothies, with Mr. Brebner reading at a table, and the\ncongregation perched about in the double tier of sleeping bunks; and to\nhear the singing of the psalms, “the chapters,” the inevitable Spurgeon’s\nsermon, and the old, eloquent lighthouse prayer.\n\nIn fine weather, when by the spy-glass on the hill the sea was observed\nto run low upon the reef, there would be a sound of preparation in the\nvery early morning; and before the sun had risen from behind Ben More,\nthe tender would steam out of the bay.  Over fifteen sea-miles of the\ngreat blue Atlantic rollers she ploughed her way, trailing at her tail a\nbrace of wallowing stone-lighters.  The open ocean widened upon either\nboard, and the hills of the mainland began to go down on the horizon,\nbefore she came to her unhomely destination, and lay-to at last where the\nrock clapped its black head above the swell, with the tall iron barrack\non its spider legs, and the truncated tower, and the cranes waving their\narms, and the smoke of the engine-fire rising in the mid-sea.  An ugly\nreef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no pleasant assemblage of shelves, and\npools, and creeks, about which a child might play for a whole summer\nwithout weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval\nnodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and\nalive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug.\nNo other life was there but that of sea-birds, and of the sea itself,\nthat here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for\never, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on\nthe rock itself.  Times were different upon Dhu-Heartach when it blew,\nand the night fell dark, and the neighbour lights of Skerryvore and\nRhu-val were quenched in fog, and the men sat prisoned high up in their\niron drum, that then resounded with the lashing of the sprays.  Fear sat\nwith them in their sea-beleaguered dwelling; and the colour changed in\nanxious faces when some greater billow struck the barrack, and its\npillars quivered and sprang under the blow.  It was then that the foreman\nbuilder, Mr. Goodwillie, whom I see before me still in his rock-habit of\nundecipherable rags, would get his fiddle down and strike up human\nminstrelsy amid the music of the storm.  But it was in sunshine only that\nI saw Dhu-Heartach; and it was in sunshine, or the yet lovelier summer\nafterglow, that the steamer would return to Earraid, ploughing an\nenchanted sea; the obedient lighters, relieved of their deck cargo,\nriding in her wake more quietly; and the steersman upon each, as she rose\non the long swell, standing tall and dark against the shining west.\n\nBut it was in Earraid itself that I delighted chiefly.  The lighthouse\nsettlement scarce encroached beyond its fences; over the top of the first\nbrae the ground was all virgin, the world all shut out, the face of\nthings unchanged by any of man’s doings.  Here was no living presence,\nsave for the limpets on the rocks, for some old, gray, rain-beaten ram\nthat I might rouse out of a ferny den betwixt two boulders, or for the\nhaunting and the piping of the gulls.  It was older than man; it was\nfound so by incoming Celts, and seafaring Norsemen, and Columba’s\npriests.  The earthy savour of the bog-plants, the rude disorder of the\nboulders, the inimitable seaside brightness of the air, the brine and the\niodine, the lap of the billows among the weedy reefs, the sudden\nspringing up of a great run of dashing surf along the sea-front of the\nisle, all that I saw and felt my predecessors must have seen and felt\nwith scarce a difference.  I steeped myself in open air and in past ages.\n\n    “Delightful would it be to me to be in _Uchd Ailiun_\n       On the pinnacle of a rock,\n    That I might often see\n       The face of the ocean;\n    That I might hear the song of the wonderful birds,\n       Source of happiness;\n    That I might hear the thunder of the crowding waves\n       Upon the rocks:\n    At times at work without compulsion—\n       This would be delightful;\n    At times plucking dulse from the rocks\n       At times at fishing.”\n\nSo, about the next island of Iona, sang Columba himself twelve hundred\nyears before.  And so might I have sung of Earraid.\n\nAnd all the while I was aware that this life of sea-bathing and\nsun-burning was for me but a holiday.  In that year cannon were roaring\nfor days together on French battlefields; and I would sit in my isle (I\ncall it mine, after the use of lovers) and think upon the war, and the\nloudness of these far-away battles, and the pain of the men’s wounds, and\nthe weariness of their marching.  And I would think too of that other war\nwhich is as old as mankind, and is indeed the life of man: the unsparing\nwar, the grinding slavery of competition; the toil of seventy years,\ndear-bought bread, precarious honour, the perils and pitfalls, and the\npoor rewards.  It was a long look forward; the future summoned me as with\ntrumpet calls, it warned me back as with a voice of weeping and\nbeseeching; and I thrilled and trembled on the brink of life, like a\nchildish bather on the beach.\n\nThere was another young man on Earraid in these days, and we were much\ntogether, bathing, clambering on the boulders, trying to sail a boat and\nspinning round instead in the oily whirlpools of the roost.  But the most\npart of the time we spoke of the great uncharted desert of our futures;\nwondering together what should there befall us; hearing with surprise the\nsound of our own voices in the empty vestibule of youth.  As far, and as\nhard, as it seemed then to look forward to the grave, so far it seems now\nto look backward upon these emotions; so hard to recall justly that loath\nsubmission, as of the sacrificial bull, with which we stooped our necks\nunder the yoke of destiny.  I met my old companion but the other day; I\ncannot tell of course what he was thinking; but, upon my part, I was\nwondering to see us both so much at home, and so composed and sedentary\nin the world; and how much we had gained, and how much we had lost, to\nattain to that composure; and which had been upon the whole our best\nestate: when we sat there prating sensibly like men of some experience,\nor when we shared our timorous and hopeful counsels in a western islet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THOMAS STEVENSON—CIVIL ENGINEER\n\n\nThe death of Thomas Stevenson will mean not very much to the general\nreader.  His service to mankind took on forms of which the public knows\nlittle and understands less.  He came seldom to London, and then only as\na task, remaining always a stranger and a convinced provincial; putting\nup for years at the same hotel where his father had gone before him;\nfaithful for long to the same restaurant, the same church, and the same\ntheatre, chosen simply for propinquity; steadfastly refusing to dine out.\nHe had a circle of his own, indeed, at home; few men were more beloved in\nEdinburgh, where he breathed an air that pleased him; and wherever he\nwent, in railway carriages or hotel smoking-rooms, his strange, humorous\nvein of talk, and his transparent honesty, raised him up friends and\nadmirers.  But to the general public and the world of London, except\nabout the parliamentary committee-rooms, he remained unknown.  All the\ntime, his lights were in every part of the world, guiding the mariner;\nhis firm were consulting engineers to the Indian, the New Zealand, and\nthe Japanese Lighthouse Boards, so that Edinburgh was a world centre for\nthat branch of applied science; in Germany, he had been called “the\nNestor of lighthouse illumination”; even in France, where his claims were\nlong denied, he was at last, on the occasion of the late Exposition,\nrecognised and medalled.  And to show by one instance the inverted nature\nof his reputation, comparatively small at home, yet filling the world, a\nfriend of mine was this winter on a visit to the Spanish main, and was\nasked by a Peruvian if he “knew Mr. Stevenson the author, because his\nworks were much esteemed in Peru?”  My friend supposed the reference was\nto the writer of tales; but the Peruvian had never heard of _Dr. Jekyll_;\nwhat he had in his eye, what was esteemed in Peru, where the volumes of\nthe engineer.\n\nThomas Stevenson was born at Edinburgh in the year 1818, the grandson of\nThomas Smith, first engineer to the Board of Northern Lights, son of\nRobert Stevenson, brother of Alan and David; so that his nephew, David\nAlan Stevenson, joined with him at the time of his death in the\nengineership, is the sixth of the family who has held, successively or\nconjointly, that office.  The Bell Rock, his father’s great triumph, was\nfinished before he was born; but he served under his brother Alan in the\nbuilding of Skerryvore, the noblest of all extant deep-sea lights; and,\nin conjunction with his brother David, he added two—the Chickens and Dhu\nHeartach—to that small number of man’s extreme outposts in the ocean.  Of\nshore lights, the two brothers last named erected no fewer than\ntwenty-seven; of beacons, {84} about twenty-five.  Many harbours were\nsuccessfully carried out: one, the harbour of Wick, the chief disaster of\nmy father’s life, was a failure; the sea proved too strong for man’s\narts; and after expedients hitherto unthought of, and on a scale\nhyper-cyclopean, the work must be deserted, and now stands a ruin in that\nbleak, God-forsaken bay, ten miles from John-o’-Groat’s.  In the\nimprovement of rivers the brothers were likewise in a large way of\npractice over both England and Scotland, nor had any British engineer\nanything approaching their experience.\n\nIt was about this nucleus of his professional labours that all my\nfather’s scientific inquiries and inventions centred; these proceeded\nfrom, and acted back upon, his daily business.  Thus it was as a harbour\nengineer that he became interested in the propagation and reduction of\nwaves; a difficult subject in regard to which he has left behind him much\nsuggestive matter and some valuable approximate results.  Storms were his\nsworn adversaries, and it was through the study of storms that he\napproached that of meteorology at large.  Many who knew him not\notherwise, knew—perhaps have in their gardens—his louvre-boarded screen\nfor instruments.  But the great achievement of his life was, of course,\nin optics as applied to lighthouse illumination.  Fresnel had done much;\nFresnel had settled the fixed light apparatus on a principle that still\nseems unimprovable; and when Thomas Stevenson stepped in and brought to a\ncomparable perfection the revolving light, a not unnatural jealousy and\nmuch painful controversy rose in France.  It had its hour; and, as I have\ntold already, even in France it has blown by.  Had it not, it would have\nmattered the less, since all through his life my father continued to\njustify his claim by fresh advances.  New apparatus for lights in new\nsituations was continually being designed with the same unwearied search\nafter perfection, the same nice ingenuity of means; and though the\nholophotal revolving light perhaps still remains his most elegant\ncontrivance, it is difficult to give it the palm over the much later\ncondensing system, with its thousand possible modifications.  The number\nand the value of these improvements entitle their author to the name of\none of mankind’s benefactors.  In all parts of the world a safer landfall\nawaits the mariner.  Two things must be said: and, first, that Thomas\nStevenson was no mathematician.  Natural shrewdness, a sentiment of\noptical laws, and a great intensity of consideration led him to just\nconclusions; but to calculate the necessary formulæ for the instruments\nhe had conceived was often beyond him, and he must fall back on the help\nof others, notably on that of his cousin and lifelong intimate friend,\n_emeritus_ Professor Swan, of St. Andrews, and his later friend,\nProfessor P. G. Tait.  It is a curious enough circumstance, and a great\nencouragement to others, that a man so ill equipped should have succeeded\nin one of the most abstract and arduous walks of applied science.  The\nsecond remark is one that applies to the whole family, and only\nparticularly to Thomas Stevenson from the great number and importance of\nhis inventions: holding as the Stevensons did a Government appointment\nthey regarded their original work as something due already to the nation,\nand none of them has ever taken out a patent.  It is another cause of the\ncomparative obscurity of the name: for a patent not only brings in money,\nit infallibly spreads reputation; and my father’s instruments enter\nanonymously into a hundred light-rooms, and are passed anonymously over\nin a hundred reports, where the least considerable patent would stand out\nand tell its author’s story.\n\nBut the life-work of Thomas Stevenson remains; what we have lost, what we\nnow rather try to recall, is the friend and companion.  He was a man of a\nsomewhat antique strain: with a blended sternness and softness that was\nwholly Scottish and at first somewhat bewildering; with a profound\nessential melancholy of disposition and (what often accompanies it) the\nmost humorous geniality in company; shrewd and childish; passionately\nattached, passionately prejudiced; a man of many extremes, many faults of\ntemper, and no very stable foothold for himself among life’s troubles.\nYet he was a wise adviser; many men, and these not inconsiderable, took\ncounsel with him habitually.  “I sat at his feet,” writes one of these,\n“when I asked his advice, and when the broad brow was set in thought and\nthe firm mouth said his say, I always knew that no man could add to the\nworth of the conclusion.”  He had excellent taste, though whimsical and\npartial; collected old furniture and delighted specially in sunflowers\nlong before the days of Mr. Wilde; took a lasting pleasure in prints and\npictures; was a devout admirer of Thomson of Duddingston at a time when\nfew shared the taste; and though he read little, was constant to his\nfavourite books.  He had never any Greek; Latin he happily re-taught\nhimself after he had left school, where he was a mere consistent idler:\nhappily, I say, for Lactantius, Vossius, and Cardinal Bona were his chief\nauthors.  The first he must have read for twenty years uninterruptedly,\nkeeping it near him in his study, and carrying it in his bag on journeys.\nAnother old theologian, Brown of Wamphray, was often in his hands.  When\nhe was indisposed, he had two books, _Guy Mannering_ and _The Parent’s\nAssistant_, of which he never wearied.  He was a strong Conservative, or,\nas he preferred to call himself, a Tory; except in so far as his views\nwere modified by a hot-headed chivalrous sentiment for women.  He was\nactually in favour of a marriage law under which any woman might have a\ndivorce for the asking, and no man on any ground whatever; and the same\nsentiment found another expression in a Magdalen Mission in Edinburgh,\nfounded and largely supported by himself.  This was but one of the many\nchannels of his public generosity; his private was equally unstrained.\nThe Church of Scotland, of which he held the doctrines (though in a sense\nof his own) and to which he bore a clansman’s loyalty, profited often by\nhis time and money; and though, from a morbid sense of his own\nunworthiness, he would never consent to be an office-bearer, his advice\nwas often sought, and he served the Church on many committees.  What he\nperhaps valued highest in his work were his contributions to the defence\nof Christianity; one of which, in particular, was praised by Hutchinson\nStirling and reprinted at the request of Professor Crawford.\n\nHis sense of his own unworthiness I have called morbid; morbid, too, were\nhis sense of the fleetingness of life and his concern for death.  He had\nnever accepted the conditions of man’s life or his own character; and his\ninmost thoughts were ever tinged with the Celtic melancholy.  Cases of\nconscience were sometimes grievous to him, and that delicate employment\nof a scientific witness cost him many qualms.  But he found respite from\nthese troublesome humours in his work, in his lifelong study of natural\nscience, in the society of those he loved, and in his daily walks, which\nnow would carry him far into the country with some congenial friend, and\nnow keep him dangling about the town from one old book-shop to another,\nand scraping romantic acquaintance with every dog that passed.  His talk,\ncompounded of so much sterling sense and so much freakish humour, and\nclothed in language so apt, droll, and emphatic, was a perpetual delight\nto all who knew him before the clouds began to settle on his mind.  His\nuse of language was both just and picturesque; and when at the beginning\nof his illness he began to feel the ebbing of this power, it was strange\nand painful to hear him reject one word after another as inadequate, and\nat length desist from the search and leave his phrase unfinished rather\nthan finish it without propriety.  It was perhaps another Celtic trait\nthat his affections and emotions, passionate as these were, and liable to\npassionate ups and downs, found the most eloquent expression both in\nwords and gestures.  Love, anger, and indignation shone through him and\nbroke forth in imagery, like what we read of Southern races.  For all\nthese emotional extremes, and in spite of the melancholy ground of his\ncharacter, he had upon the whole a happy life; nor was he less fortunate\nin his death, which at the last came to him unaware.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. TALK AND TALKERS\n\n\n    Sir, we had a good talk.—JOHNSON.\n\n    As we must account for every idle word, so we must for every idle\n    silence.—FRANKLIN.\n\nThere can be no fairer ambition than to excel in talk; to be affable,\ngay, ready, clear and welcome; to have a fact, a thought, or an\nillustration, pat to every subject; and not only to cheer the flight of\ntime among our intimates, but bear our part in that great international\ncongress, always sitting, where public wrongs are first declared, public\nerrors first corrected, and the course of public opinion shaped, day by\nday, a little nearer to the right.  No measure comes before Parliament\nbut it has been long ago prepared by the grand jury of the talkers; no\nbook is written that has not been largely composed by their assistance.\nLiterature in many of its branches is no other than the shadow of good\ntalk; but the imitation falls far short of the original in life, freedom\nand effect.  There are always two to a talk, giving and taking, comparing\nexperience and according conclusions.  Talk is fluid, tentative,\ncontinually “in further search and progress”; while written words remain\nfixed, become idols even to the writer, found wooden dogmatisms, and\npreserve flies of obvious error in the amber of the truth.  Last and\nchief, while literature, gagged with linsey-woolsey, can only deal with a\nfraction of the life of man, talk goes fancy free and may call a spade a\nspade.  Talk has none of the freezing immunities of the pulpit.  It\ncannot, even if it would, become merely æsthetic or merely classical like\nliterature.  A jest intervenes, the solemn humbug is dissolved in\nlaughter, and speech runs forth out of the contemporary groove into the\nopen fields of nature, cheery and cheering, like schoolboys out of\nschool.  And it is in talk alone that we can learn our period and\nourselves.  In short, the first duty of a man is to speak; that is his\nchief business in this world; and talk, which is the harmonious speech of\ntwo or more, is by far the most accessible of pleasures.  It costs\nnothing in money; it is all profit; it completes our education, founds\nand fosters our friendships, and can be enjoyed at any age and in almost\nany state of health.\n\nThe spice of life is battle; the friendliest relations are still a kind\nof contest; and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot,\nwe must continually face some other person, eye to eye, and wrestle a\nfall whether in love or enmity.  It is still by force of body, or power\nof character or intellect, that we attain to worthy pleasures.  Men and\nwomen contend for each other in the lists of love, like rival mesmerists;\nthe active and adroit decide their challenges in the sports of the body;\nand the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation.  All sluggish and\npacific pleasures are, to the same degree, solitary and selfish; and\nevery durable bond between human beings is founded in or heightened by\nsome element of competition.  Now, the relation that has the least root\nin matter is undoubtedly that airy one of friendship; and hence, I\nsuppose, it is that good talk most commonly arises among friends.  Talk\nis, indeed, both the scene and instrument of friendship.  It is in talk\nalone that the friends can measure strength, and enjoy that amicable\ncounter-assertion of personality which is the gauge of relations and the\nsport of life.\n\nA good talk is not to be had for the asking.  Humours must first be\naccorded in a kind of overture or prologue; hour, company and\ncircumstance be suited; and then, at a fit juncture, the subject, the\nquarry of two heated minds, spring up like a deer out of the wood.  Not\nthat the talker has any of the hunter’s pride, though he has all and more\nthan all his ardour.  The genuine artist follows the stream of\nconversation as an angler follows the windings of a brook, not dallying\nwhere he fails to “kill.”  He trusts implicitly to hazard; and he is\nrewarded by continual variety, continual pleasure, and those changing\nprospects of the truth that are the best of education.  There is nothing\nin a subject, so called, that we should regard it as an idol, or follow\nit beyond the promptings of desire.  Indeed, there are few subjects; and\nso far as they are truly talkable, more than the half of them may be\nreduced to three: that I am I, that you are you, and that there are other\npeople dimly understood to be not quite the same as either.  Wherever\ntalk may range, it still runs half the time on these eternal lines.  The\ntheme being set, each plays on himself as on an instrument; asserts and\njustifies himself; ransacks his brain for instances and opinions, and\nbrings them forth new-minted, to his own surprise and the admiration of\nhis adversary.  All natural talk is a festival of ostentation; and by the\nlaws of the game each accepts and fans the vanity of the other.  It is\nfrom that reason that we venture to lay ourselves so open, that we dare\nto be so warmly eloquent, and that we swell in each other’s eyes to such\na vast proportion.  For talkers, once launched, begin to overflow the\nlimits of their ordinary selves, tower up to the height of their secret\npretensions, and give themselves out for the heroes, brave, pious,\nmusical and wise, that in their most shining moments they aspire to be.\nSo they weave for themselves with words and for a while inhabit a palace\nof delights, temple at once and theatre, where they fill the round of the\nworld’s dignities, and feast with the gods, exulting in Kudos.  And when\nthe talk is over, each goes his way, still flushed with vanity and\nadmiration, still trailing clouds of glory; each declines from the height\nof his ideal orgie, not in a moment, but by slow declension.  I remember,\nin the _entr’acte_ of an afternoon performance, coming forth into the\nsunshine, in a beautiful green, gardened corner of a romantic city; and\nas I sat and smoked, the music moving in my blood, I seemed to sit there\nand evaporate _The Flying Dutchman_ (for it was that I had been hearing)\nwith a wonderful sense of life, warmth, well-being and pride; and the\nnoises of the city, voices, bells and marching feet, fell together in my\nears like a symphonious orchestra.  In the same way, the excitement of a\ngood talk lives for a long while after in the blood, the heart still hot\nwithin you, the brain still simmering, and the physical earth swimming\naround you with the colours of the sunset.\n\nNatural talk, like ploughing, should turn up a large surface of life,\nrather than dig mines into geological strata.  Masses of experience,\nanecdote, incident, cross-lights, quotation, historical instances, the\nwhole flotsam and jetsam of two minds forced in and in upon the matter in\nhand from every point of the compass, and from every degree of mental\nelevation and abasement—these are the material with which talk is\nfortified, the food on which the talkers thrive.  Such argument as is\nproper to the exercise should still be brief and seizing.  Talk should\nproceed by instances; by the apposite, not the expository.  It should\nkeep close along the lines of humanity, near the bosoms and businesses of\nmen, at the level where history, fiction and experience intersect and\nilluminate each other.  I am I, and You are You, with all my heart; but\nconceive how these lean propositions change and brighten when, instead of\nwords, the actual you and I sit cheek by jowl, the spirit housed in the\nlive body, and the very clothes uttering voices to corroborate the story\nin the face.  Not less surprising is the change when we leave off to\nspeak of generalities—the bad, the good, the miser, and all the\ncharacters of Theophrastus—and call up other men, by anecdote or\ninstance, in their very trick and feature; or trading on a common\nknowledge, toss each other famous names, still glowing with the hues of\nlife.  Communication is no longer by words, but by the instancing of\nwhole biographies, epics, systems of philosophy, and epochs of history,\nin bulk.  That which is understood excels that which is spoken in\nquantity and quality alike; ideas thus figured and personified, change\nhands, as we may say, like coin; and the speakers imply without effort\nthe most obscure and intricate thoughts.  Strangers who have a large\ncommon ground of reading will, for this reason, come the sooner to the\ngrapple of genuine converse.  If they know Othello and Napoleon, Consuelo\nand Clarissa Harlowe, Vautrin and Steenie Steenson, they can leave\ngeneralities and begin at once to speak by figures.\n\nConduct and art are the two subjects that arise most frequently and that\nembrace the widest range of facts.  A few pleasures bear discussion for\ntheir own sake, but only those which are most social or most radically\nhuman; and even these can only be discussed among their devotees.  A\ntechnicality is always welcome to the expert, whether in athletics, art\nor law; I have heard the best kind of talk on technicalities from such\nrare and happy persons as both know and love their business.  No human\nbeing ever spoke of scenery for above two minutes at a time, which makes\nme suspect we hear too much of it in literature.  The weather is regarded\nas the very nadir and scoff of conversational topics.  And yet the\nweather, the dramatic element in scenery, is far more tractable in\nlanguage, and far more human both in import and suggestion than the\nstable features of the landscape.  Sailors and shepherds, and the people\ngenerally of coast and mountain, talk well of it; and it is often\nexcitingly presented in literature.  But the tendency of all living talk\ndraws it back and back into the common focus of humanity.  Talk is a\ncreature of the street and market-place, feeding on gossip; and its last\nresort is still in a discussion on morals.  That is the heroic form of\ngossip; heroic in virtue of its high pretensions; but still gossip,\nbecause it turns on personalities.  You can keep no men long, nor\nScotchmen at all, off moral or theological discussion.  These are to all\nthe world what law is to lawyers; they are everybody’s technicalities;\nthe medium through which all consider life, and the dialect in which they\nexpress their judgments.  I knew three young men who walked together\ndaily for some two months in a solemn and beautiful forest and in\ncloudless summer weather; daily they talked with unabated zest, and yet\nscarce wandered that whole time beyond two subjects—theology and love.\nAnd perhaps neither a court of love nor an assembly of divines would have\ngranted their premisses or welcomed their conclusions.\n\nConclusions, indeed, are not often reached by talk any more than by\nprivate thinking.  That is not the profit.  The profit is in the\nexercise, and above all in the experience; for when we reason at large on\nany subject, we review our state and history in life.  From time to time,\nhowever, and specially, I think, in talking art, talk becomes effective,\nconquering like war, widening the boundaries of knowledge like an\nexploration.  A point arises; the question takes a problematical, a\nbaffling, yet a likely air; the talkers begin to feel lively\npresentiments of some conclusion near at hand; towards this they strive\nwith emulous ardour, each by his own path, and struggling for first\nutterance; and then one leaps upon the summit of that matter with a\nshout, and almost at the same moment the other is beside him; and behold\nthey are agreed.  Like enough, the progress is illusory, a mere cat’s\ncradle having been wound and unwound out of words.  But the sense of\njoint discovery is none the less giddy and inspiriting.  And in the life\nof the talker such triumphs, though imaginary, are neither few nor far\napart; they are attained with speed and pleasure, in the hour of mirth;\nand by the nature of the process, they are always worthily shared.\n\nThere is a certain attitude, combative at once and deferential, eager to\nfight yet most averse to quarrel, which marks out at once the talkable\nman.  It is not eloquence, not fairness, not obstinacy, but a certain\nproportion of all of these that I love to encounter in my amicable\nadversaries.  They must not be pontiffs holding doctrine, but huntsmen\nquesting after elements of truth.  Neither must they be boys to be\ninstructed, but fellow-teachers with whom I may wrangle and agree on\nequal terms.  We must reach some solution, some shadow of consent; for\nwithout that, eager talk becomes a torture.  But we do not wish to reach\nit cheaply, or quickly, or without the tussle and effort wherein pleasure\nlies.\n\nThe very best talker, with me, is one whom I shall call Spring-Heel’d\nJack.  I say so, because I never knew any one who mingled so largely the\npossible ingredients of converse.  In the Spanish proverb, the fourth man\nnecessary to compound a salad, is a madman to mix it: Jack is that\nmadman.  I know not which is more remarkable; the insane lucidity of his\nconclusions the humorous eloquence of his language, or his power of\nmethod, bringing the whole of life into the focus of the subject treated,\nmixing the conversational salad like a drunken god.  He doubles like the\nserpent, changes and flashes like the shaken kaleidoscope, transmigrates\nbodily into the views of others, and so, in the twinkling of an eye and\nwith a heady rapture, turns questions inside out and flings them empty\nbefore you on the ground, like a triumphant conjuror.  It is my common\npractice when a piece of conduct puzzles me, to attack it in the presence\nof Jack with such grossness, such partiality and such wearing iteration,\nas at length shall spur him up in its defence.  In a moment he\ntransmigrates, dons the required character, and with moonstruck\nphilosophy justifies the act in question.  I can fancy nothing to compare\nwith the _vim_ of these impersonations, the strange scale of language,\nflying from Shakespeare to Kant, and from Kant to Major Dyngwell—\n\n    “As fast as a musician scatters sounds\n    Out of an instrument”\n\nthe sudden, sweeping generalisations, the absurd irrelevant\nparticularities, the wit, wisdom, folly, humour, eloquence and bathos,\neach startling in its kind, and yet all luminous in the admired disorder\nof their combination.  A talker of a different calibre, though belonging\nto the same school, is Burly.  Burly is a man of a great presence; he\ncommands a larger atmosphere, gives the impression of a grosser mass of\ncharacter than most men.  It has been said of him that his presence could\nbe felt in a room you entered blindfold; and the same, I think, has been\nsaid of other powerful constitutions condemned to much physical inaction.\nThere is something boisterous and piratic in Burly’s manner of talk which\nsuits well enough with this impression.  He will roar you down, he will\nbury his face in his hands, he will undergo passions of revolt and agony;\nand meanwhile his attitude of mind is really both conciliatory and\nreceptive; and after Pistol has been out Pistol’d, and the welkin rung\nfor hours, you begin to perceive a certain subsidence in these spring\ntorrents, points of agreement issue, and you end arm-in-arm, and in a\nglow of mutual admiration.  The outcry only serves to make your final\nunion the more unexpected and precious.  Throughout there has been\nperfect sincerity, perfect intelligence, a desire to hear although not\nalways to listen, and an unaffected eagerness to meet concessions.  You\nhave, with Burly, none of the dangers that attend debate with\nSpring-Heel’d Jack; who may at any moment turn his powers of\ntransmigration on yourself, create for you a view you never held, and\nthen furiously fall on you for holding it.  These, at least, are my two\nfavourites, and both are loud, copious, intolerant talkers.  This argues\nthat I myself am in the same category; for if we love talking at all, we\nlove a bright, fierce adversary, who will hold his ground, foot by foot,\nin much our own manner, sell his attention dearly, and give us our full\nmeasure of the dust and exertion of battle.  Both these men can be beat\nfrom a position, but it takes six hours to do it; a high and hard\nadventure, worth attempting.  With both you can pass days in an enchanted\ncountry of the mind, with people, scenery and manners of its own; live a\nlife apart, more arduous, active and glowing than any real existence; and\ncome forth again when the talk is over, as out of a theatre or a dream,\nto find the east wind still blowing and the chimney-pots of the old\nbattered city still around you.  Jack has the far finer mind, Burly the\nfar more honest; Jack gives us the animated poetry, Burly the romantic\nprose, of similar themes; the one glances high like a meteor and makes a\nlight in darkness; the other, with many changing hues of fire, burns at\nthe sea-level, like a conflagration; but both have the same humour and\nartistic interests, the same unquenched ardour in pursuit, the same gusts\nof talk and thunderclaps of contradiction.\n\nCockshot {100} is a different article, but vastly entertaining, and has\nbeen meat and drink to me for many a long evening.  His manner is dry,\nbrisk and pertinacious, and the choice of words not much.  The point\nabout him is his extraordinary readiness and spirit.  You can propound\nnothing but he has either a theory about it ready-made, or will have one\ninstantly on the stocks, and proceed to lay its timbers and launch it in\nyour presence.  “Let me see,” he will say.  “Give me a moment.  I\n_should_ have some theory for that.”  A blither spectacle than the vigour\nwith which he sets about the task, it were hard to fancy.  He is\npossessed by a demoniac energy, welding the elements for his life, and\nbending ideas, as an athlete bends a horse-shoe, with a visible and\nlively effort.  He has, in theorising, a compass, an art; what I would\ncall the synthetic gusto; something of a Herbert Spencer, who should see\nthe fun of the thing.  You are not bound, and no more is he, to place\nyour faith in these brand-new opinions.  But some of them are right\nenough, durable even for life; and the poorest serve for a cock shy—as\nwhen idle people, after picnics, float a bottle on a pond and have an\nhour’s diversion ere it sinks.  Whichever they are, serious opinions or\nhumours of the moment, he still defends his ventures with indefatigable\nwit and spirit, hitting savagely himself, but taking punishment like a\nman.  He knows and never forgets that people talk, first of all, for the\nsake of talking; conducts himself in the ring, to use the old slang, like\na thorough “glutton,” and honestly enjoys a telling facer from his\nadversary.  Cockshot is bottled effervescency, the sworn foe of sleep.\nThree-in-the-morning Cockshot, says a victim.  His talk is like the\ndriest of all imaginable dry champagnes.  Sleight of hand and inimitable\nquickness are the qualities by which he lives.  Athelred, on the other\nhand, presents you with the spectacle of a sincere and somewhat slow\nnature thinking aloud.  He is the most unready man I ever knew to shine\nin conversation.  You may see him sometimes wrestle with a refractory\njest for a minute or two together, and perhaps fail to throw it in the\nend.  And there is something singularly engaging, often instructive, in\nthe simplicity with which he thus exposes the process as well as the\nresult, the works as well as the dial of the clock.  Withal he has his\nhours of inspiration.  Apt words come to him as if by accident, and,\ncoming from deeper down, they smack the more personally, they have the\nmore of fine old crusted humanity, rich in sediment and humour.  There\nare sayings of his in which he has stamped himself into the very grain of\nthe language; you would think he must have worn the words next his skin\nand slept with them.  Yet it is not as a sayer of particular good things\nthat Athelred is most to be regarded, rather as the stalwart woodman of\nthought.  I have pulled on a light cord often enough, while he has been\nwielding the broad-axe; and between us, on this unequal division, many a\nspecious fallacy has fallen.  I have known him to battle the same\nquestion night after night for years, keeping it in the reign of talk,\nconstantly applying it and re-applying it to life with humorous or grave\nintention, and all the while, never hurrying, nor flagging, nor taking an\nunfair advantage of the facts.  Jack at a given moment, when arising, as\nit were, from the tripod, can be more radiantly just to those from whom\nhe differs; but then the tenor of his thoughts is even calumnious; while\nAthelred, slower to forge excuses, is yet slower to condemn, and sits\nover the welter of the world, vacillating but still judicial, and still\nfaithfully contending with his doubts.\n\nBoth the last talkers deal much in points of conduct and religion studied\nin the “dry light” of prose.  Indirectly and as if against his will the\nsame elements from time to time appear in the troubled and poetic talk of\nOpalstein.  His various and exotic knowledge, complete although unready\nsympathies, and fine, full, discriminative flow of language, fit him out\nto be the best of talkers; so perhaps he is with some, not quite with\nme—_proxime accessit_, I should say.  He sings the praises of the earth\nand the arts, flowers and jewels, wine and music, in a moonlight,\nserenading manner, as to the light guitar; even wisdom comes from his\ntongue like singing; no one is, indeed, more tuneful in the upper notes.\nBut even while he sings the song of the Sirens, he still hearkens to the\nbarking of the Sphinx.  Jarring Byronic notes interrupt the flow of his\nHoratian humours.  His mirth has something of the tragedy of the world\nfor its perpetual background; and he feasts like Don Giovanni to a double\norchestra, one lightly sounding for the dance, one pealing Beethoven in\nthe distance.  He is not truly reconciled either with life or with\nhimself; and this instant war in his members sometimes divides the man’s\nattention.  He does not always, perhaps not often, frankly surrender\nhimself in conversation.  He brings into the talk other thoughts than\nthose which he expresses; you are conscious that he keeps an eye on\nsomething else, that he does not shake off the world, nor quite forget\nhimself.  Hence arise occasional disappointments; even an occasional\nunfairness for his companions, who find themselves one day giving too\nmuch, and the next, when they are wary out of season, giving perhaps too\nlittle.  Purcel is in another class from any I have mentioned.  He is no\ndebater, but appears in conversation, as occasion rises, in two distinct\ncharacters, one of which I admire and fear, and the other love.  In the\nfirst, he is radiantly civil and rather silent, sits on a high, courtly\nhilltop, and from that vantage-ground drops you his remarks like favours.\nHe seems not to share in our sublunary contentions; he wears no sign of\ninterest; when on a sudden there falls in a crystal of wit, so polished\nthat the dull do not perceive it, but so right that the sensitive are\nsilenced.  True talk should have more body and blood, should be louder,\nvainer and more declaratory of the man; the true talker should not hold\nso steady an advantage over whom he speaks with; and that is one reason\nout of a score why I prefer my Purcel in his second character, when he\nunbends into a strain of graceful gossip, singing like the fireside\nkettle.  In these moods he has an elegant homeliness that rings of the\ntrue Queen Anne.  I know another person who attains, in his moments, to\nthe insolence of a Restoration comedy, speaking, I declare, as Congreve\nwrote; but that is a sport of nature, and scarce falls under the rubric,\nfor there is none, alas! to give him answer.\n\nOne last remark occurs: It is the mark of genuine conversation that the\nsayings can scarce be quoted with their full effect beyond the circle of\ncommon friends.  To have their proper weight they should appear in a\nbiography, and with the portrait of the speaker.  Good talk is dramatic;\nit is like an impromptu piece of acting where each should represent\nhimself to the greatest advantage; and that is the best kind of talk\nwhere each speaker is most fully and candidly himself, and where, if you\nwere to shift the speeches round from one to another, there would be the\ngreatest loss in significance and perspicuity.  It is for this reason\nthat talk depends so wholly on our company.  We should like to introduce\nFalstaff and Mercutio, or Falstaff and Sir Toby; but Falstaff in talk\nwith Cordelia seems even painful.  Most of us, by the Protean quality of\nman, can talk to some degree with all; but the true talk, that strikes\nout all the slumbering best of us, comes only with the peculiar brethren\nof our spirits, is founded as deep as love in the constitution of our\nbeing, and is a thing to relish with all our energy, while yet we have\nit, and to be grateful for forever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. TALK AND TALKERS {105}\n\n\nII\n\n\nIn the last paper there was perhaps too much about mere debate; and there\nwas nothing said at all about that kind of talk which is merely luminous\nand restful, a higher power of silence, the quiet of the evening shared\nby ruminating friends.  There is something, aside from personal\npreference, to be alleged in support of this omission.  Those who are no\nchimney-cornerers, who rejoice in the social thunderstorm, have a ground\nin reason for their choice.  They get little rest indeed; but restfulness\nis a quality for cattle; the virtues are all active, life is alert, and\nit is in repose that men prepare themselves for evil.  On the other hand,\nthey are bruised into a knowledge of themselves and others; they have in\na high degree the fencer’s pleasure in dexterity displayed and proved;\nwhat they get they get upon life’s terms, paying for it as they go; and\nonce the talk is launched, they are assured of honest dealing from an\nadversary eager like themselves.  The aboriginal man within us, the\ncave-dweller, still lusty as when he fought tooth and nail for roots and\nberries, scents this kind of equal battle from afar; it is like his old\nprimæval days upon the crags, a return to the sincerity of savage life\nfrom the comfortable fictions of the civilised.  And if it be delightful\nto the Old Man, it is none the less profitable to his younger brother,\nthe conscientious gentleman I feel never quite sure of your urbane and\nsmiling coteries; I fear they indulge a man’s vanities in silence, suffer\nhim to encroach, encourage him on to be an ass, and send him forth again,\nnot merely contemned for the moment, but radically more contemptible than\nwhen he entered.  But if I have a flushed, blustering fellow for my\nopposite, bent on carrying a point, my vanity is sure to have its ears\nrubbed, once at least, in the course of the debate.  He will not spare me\nwhen we differ; he will not fear to demonstrate my folly to my face.\n\nFor many natures there is not much charm in the still, chambered society,\nthe circle of bland countenances, the digestive silence, the admired\nremark, the flutter of affectionate approval.  They demand more\natmosphere and exercise; “a gale upon their spirits,” as our pious\nancestors would phrase it; to have their wits well breathed in an\nuproarious Valhalla.  And I suspect that the choice, given their\ncharacter and faults, is one to be defended.  The purely wise are\nsilenced by facts; they talk in a clear atmosphere, problems lying around\nthem like a view in nature; if they can be shown to be somewhat in the\nwrong, they digest the reproof like a thrashing, and make better\nintellectual blood.  They stand corrected by a whisper; a word or a\nglance reminds them of the great eternal law.  But it is not so with all.\nOthers in conversation seek rather contact with their fellow-men than\nincrease of knowledge or clarity of thought.  The drama, not the\nphilosophy, of life is the sphere of their intellectual activity.  Even\nwhen they pursue truth, they desire as much as possible of what we may\ncall human scenery along the road they follow.  They dwell in the heart\nof life; the blood sounding in their ears, their eyes laying hold of what\ndelights them with a brutal avidity that makes them blind to all besides,\ntheir interest riveted on people, living, loving, talking, tangible\npeople.  To a man of this description, the sphere of argument seems very\npale and ghostly.  By a strong expression, a perturbed countenance,\nfloods of tears, an insult which his conscience obliges him to swallow,\nhe is brought round to knowledge which no syllogism would have conveyed\nto him.  His own experience is so vivid, he is so superlatively conscious\nof himself, that if, day after day, he is allowed to hector and hear\nnothing but approving echoes, he will lose his hold on the soberness of\nthings and take himself in earnest for a god.  Talk might be to such an\none the very way of moral ruin; the school where he might learn to be at\nonce intolerable and ridiculous.\n\nThis character is perhaps commoner than philosophers suppose.  And for\npersons of that stamp to learn much by conversation, they must speak with\ntheir superiors, not in intellect, for that is a superiority that must be\nproved, but in station.  If they cannot find a friend to bully them for\ntheir good, they must find either an old man, a woman, or some one so far\nbelow them in the artificial order of society, that courtesy may be\nparticularly exercised.\n\nThe best teachers are the aged.  To the old our mouths are always partly\nclosed; we must swallow our obvious retorts and listen.  They sit above\nour heads, on life’s raised dais, and appeal at once to our respect and\npity.  A flavour of the old school, a touch of something different in\ntheir manner—which is freer and rounder, if they come of what is called a\ngood family, and often more timid and precise if they are of the middle\nclass—serves, in these days, to accentuate the difference of age and add\na distinction to gray hairs.  But their superiority is founded more\ndeeply than by outward marks or gestures.  They are before us in the\nmarch of man; they have more or less solved the irking problem; they have\nbattled through the equinox of life; in good and evil they have held\ntheir course; and now, without open shame, they near the crown and\nharbour.  It may be we have been struck with one of fortune’s darts; we\ncan scarce be civil, so cruelly is our spirit tossed.  Yet long before we\nwere so much as thought upon, the like calamity befell the old man or\nwoman that now, with pleasant humour, rallies us upon our inattention,\nsitting composed in the holy evening of man’s life, in the clear shining\nafter rain.  We grow ashamed of our distresses, new and hot and coarse,\nlike villainous roadside brandy; we see life in aerial perspective, under\nthe heavens of faith; and out of the worst, in the mere presence of\ncontented elders, look forward and take patience.  Fear shrinks before\nthem “like a thing reproved,” not the flitting and ineffectual fear of\ndeath, but the instant, dwelling terror of the responsibilities and\nrevenges of life.  Their speech, indeed, is timid; they report lions in\nthe path; they counsel a meticulous footing; but their serene, marred\nfaces are more eloquent and tell another story.  Where they have gone, we\nwill go also, not very greatly fearing; what they have endured unbroken,\nwe also, God helping us, will make a shift to bear.\n\nNot only is the presence of the aged in itself remedial, but their minds\nare stored with antidotes, wisdom’s simples, plain considerations\noverlooked by youth.  They have matter to communicate, be they never so\nstupid.  Their talk is not merely literature, it is great literature;\nclassic in virtue of the speaker’s detachment, studded, like a book of\ntravel, with things we should not otherwise have learnt.  In virtue, I\nhave said, of the speaker’s detachment,—and this is why, of two old men,\nthe one who is not your father speaks to you with the more sensible\nauthority; for in the paternal relation the oldest have lively interests\nand remain still young.  Thus I have known two young men great friends;\neach swore by the other’s father; the father of each swore by the other\nlad; and yet each pair of parent and child were perpetually by the ears.\nThis is typical: it reads like the germ of some kindly comedy.\n\nThe old appear in conversation in two characters: the critically silent\nand the garrulous anecdotic.  The last is perhaps what we look for; it is\nperhaps the more instructive.  An old gentleman, well on in years, sits\nhandsomely and naturally in the bow-window of his age, scanning\nexperience with reverted eye; and chirping and smiling, communicates the\naccidents and reads the lesson of his long career.  Opinions are\nstrengthened, indeed, but they are also weeded out in the course of\nyears.  What remains steadily present to the eye of the retired veteran\nin his hermitage, what still ministers to his content, what still\nquickens his old honest heart—these are “the real long-lived things” that\nWhitman tells us to prefer.  Where youth agrees with age, not where they\ndiffer, wisdom lies; and it is when the young disciple finds his heart to\nbeat in tune with his gray-bearded teacher’s that a lesson may be\nlearned.  I have known one old gentleman, whom I may name, for he is now\ngathered to his stock—Robert Hunter, Sheriff of Dumbarton, and author of\nan excellent law-book still re-edited and republished.  Whether he was\noriginally big or little is more than I can guess.  When I knew him he\nwas all fallen away and fallen in; crooked and shrunken; buckled into a\nstiff waistcoat for support; troubled by ailments, which kept him\nhobbling in and out of the room; one foot gouty; a wig for decency, not\nfor deception, on his head; close shaved, except under his chin—and for\nthat he never failed to apologise, for it went sore against the\ntraditions of his life.  You can imagine how he would fare in a novel by\nMiss Mather; yet this rag of a Chelsea veteran lived to his last year in\nthe plenitude of all that is best in man, brimming with human kindness,\nand staunch as a Roman soldier under his manifold infirmities.  You could\nnot say that he had lost his memory, for he would repeat Shakespeare and\nWebster and Jeremy Taylor and Burke by the page together; but the\nparchment was filled up, there was no room for fresh inscriptions, and he\nwas capable of repeating the same anecdote on many successive visits.\nHis voice survived in its full power, and he took a pride in using it.\nOn his last voyage as Commissioner of lighthouses, he hailed a ship at\nsea and made himself clearly audible without a speaking trumpet, ruffling\nthe while with a proper vanity in his achievement.  He had a habit of\neking out his words with interrogative hems, which was puzzling and a\nlittle wearisome, suited ill with his appearance, and seemed a survival\nfrom some former stage of bodily portliness.  Of yore, when he was a\ngreat pedestrian and no enemy to good claret, he may have pointed with\nthese minute guns his allocutions to the bench.  His humour was perfectly\nequable, set beyond the reach of fate; gout, rheumatism, stone and gravel\nmight have combined their forces against that frail tabernacle, but when\nI came round on Sunday evening, he would lay aside Jeremy Taylor’s _Life\nof Christ_ and greet me with the same open brow, the same kind formality\nof manner.  His opinions and sympathies dated the man almost to a decade.\nHe had begun life, under his mother’s influence, as an admirer of Junius,\nbut on maturer knowledge had transferred his admiration to Burke.  He\ncautioned me, with entire gravity, to be punctilious in writing English;\nnever to forget that I was a Scotchman, that English was a foreign\ntongue, and that if I attempted the colloquial, I should certainly, be\nshamed: the remark was apposite, I suppose, in the days of David Hume.\nScott was too new for him; he had known the author—known him, too, for a\nTory; and to the genuine classic a contemporary is always something of a\ntrouble.  He had the old, serious love of the play; had even, as he was\nproud to tell, played a certain part in the history of Shakespearian\nrevivals, for he had successfully pressed on Murray, of the old Edinburgh\nTheatre, the idea of producing Shakespeare’s fairy pieces with great\nscenic display.  A moderate in religion, he was much struck in the last\nyears of his life by a conversation with two young lads, revivalists\n“H’m,” he would say—“new to me.  I have had—h’m—no such experience.”  It\nstruck him, not with pain, rather with a solemn philosophic interest,\nthat he, a Christian as he hoped, and a Christian of so old a standing,\nshould hear these young fellows talking of his own subject, his own\nweapons that he had fought the battle of life with,—“and—h’m—not\nunderstand.”  In this wise and graceful attitude he did justice to\nhimself and others, reposed unshaken in his old beliefs, and recognised\ntheir limits without anger or alarm.  His last recorded remark, on the\nlast night of his life, was after he had been arguing against Calvinism\nwith his minister and was interrupted by an intolerable pang.  “After\nall,” he said, “of all the ’isms, I know none so bad as rheumatism.”  My\nown last sight of him was some time before, when we dined together at an\ninn; he had been on circuit, for he stuck to his duties like a chief part\nof his existence; and I remember it as the only occasion on which he ever\nsoiled his lips with slang—a thing he loathed.  We were both Roberts; and\nas we took our places at table, he addressed me with a twinkle: “We are\njust what you would call two bob.”  He offered me port, I remember, as\nthe proper milk of youth; spoke of “twenty-shilling notes”; and\nthroughout the meal was full of old-world pleasantry and quaintness, like\nan ancient boy on a holiday.  But what I recall chiefly was his\nconfession that he had never read _Othello_ to an end.  Shakespeare was\nhis continual study.  He loved nothing better than to display his\nknowledge and memory by adducing parallel passages from Shakespeare,\npassages where the same word was employed, or the same idea differently\ntreated.  But _Othello_ had beaten him.  “That noble gentleman and that\nnoble lady—h’m—too painful for me.”  The same night the hoardings were\ncovered with posters, “Burlesque of _Othello_,” and the contrast blazed\nup in my mind like a bonfire.  An unforgettable look it gave me into that\nkind man’s soul.  His acquaintance was indeed a liberal and pious\neducation.  All the humanities were taught in that bare dining-room\nbeside his gouty footstool.  He was a piece of good advice; he was\nhimself the instance that pointed and adorned his various talk.  Nor\ncould a young man have found elsewhere a place so set apart from envy,\nfear, discontent, or any of the passions that debase; a life so honest\nand composed; a soul like an ancient violin, so subdued to harmony,\nresponding to a touch in music—as in that dining-room, with Mr. Hunter\nchatting at the eleventh hour, under the shadow of eternity, fearless and\ngentle.\n\nThe second class of old people are not anecdotic; they are rather hearers\nthan talkers, listening to the young with an amused and critical\nattention.  To have this sort of intercourse to perfection, I think we\nmust go to old ladies.  Women are better hearers than men, to begin with;\nthey learn, I fear in anguish, to bear with the tedious and infantile\nvanity of the other sex; and we will take more from a woman than even\nfrom the oldest man in the way of biting comment.  Biting comment is the\nchief part, whether for profit or amusement, in this business.  The old\nlady that I have in my eye is a very caustic speaker, her tongue, after\nyears of practice, in absolute command, whether for silence or attack.\nIf she chance to dislike you, you will be tempted to curse the malignity\nof age.  But if you chance to please even slightly, you will be listened\nto with a particular laughing grace of sympathy, and from time to time\nchastised, as if in play, with a parasol as heavy as a pole-axe.  It\nrequires a singular art, as well as the vantage-ground of age, to deal\nthese stunning corrections among the coxcombs of the young.  The pill is\ndisguised in sugar of wit; it is administered as a compliment—if you had\nnot pleased, you would not have been censured; it is a personal affair—a\nhyphen, _a trait d’union_, between you and your censor; age’s\nphilandering, for her pleasure and your good.  Incontestably the young\nman feels very much of a fool; but he must be a perfect Malvolio, sick\nwith self-love, if he cannot take an open buffet and still smile.  The\ncorrection of silence is what kills; when you know you have transgressed,\nand your friend says nothing and avoids your eye.  If a man were made of\ngutta-percha, his heart would quail at such a moment.  But when the word\nis out, the worst is over; and a fellow with any good-humour at all may\npass through a perfect hail of witty criticism, every bare place on his\nsoul hit to the quick with a shrewd missile, and reappear, as if after a\ndive, tingling with a fine moral reaction, and ready, with a shrinking\nreadiness, one-third loath, for a repetition of the discipline.\n\nThere are few women, not well sunned and ripened, and perhaps toughened,\nwho can thus stand apart from a man and say the true thing with a kind of\ngenial cruelty.  Still there are some—and I doubt if there be any man who\ncan return the compliment.  The class of man represented by Vernon\nWhitford in _The Egoist_ says, indeed, the true thing, but he says it\nstockishly.  Vernon is a noble fellow, and makes, by the way, a noble and\ninstructive contrast to Daniel Deronda; his conduct is the conduct of a\nman of honour; but we agree with him, against our consciences, when he\nremorsefully considers “its astonishing dryness.”  He is the best of men,\nbut the best of women manage to combine all that and something more.\nTheir very faults assist them; they are helped even by the falseness of\ntheir position in life.  They can retire into the fortified camp of the\nproprieties.  They can touch a subject and suppress it.  The most adroit\nemploy a somewhat elaborate reserve as a means to be frank, much as they\nwear gloves when they shake hands.  But a man has the full responsibility\nof his freedom, cannot evade a question, can scarce be silent without\nrudeness, must answer for his words upon the moment, and is not seldom\nleft face to face with a damning choice, between the more or less\ndishonourable wriggling of Deronda and the downright woodenness of Vernon\nWhitford.\n\nBut the superiority of women is perpetually menaced; they do not sit\nthroned on infirmities like the old; they are suitors as well as\nsovereigns; their vanity is engaged, their affections are too apt to\nfollow; and hence much of the talk between the sexes degenerates into\nsomething unworthy of the name.  The desire to please, to shine with a\ncertain softness of lustre and to draw a fascinating picture of oneself,\nbanishes from conversation all that is sterling and most of what is\nhumorous.  As soon as a strong current of mutual admiration begins to\nflow, the human interest triumphs entirely over the intellectual, and the\ncommerce of words, consciously or not, becomes secondary to the\ncommercing of eyes.  But even where this ridiculous danger is avoided,\nand a man and woman converse equally and honestly, something in their\nnature or their education falsifies the strain.  An instinct prompts them\nto agree; and where that is impossible, to agree to differ.  Should they\nneglect the warning, at the first suspicion of an argument, they find\nthemselves in different hemispheres.  About any point of business or\nconduct, any actual affair demanding settlement, a woman will speak and\nlisten, hear and answer arguments, not only with natural wisdom, but with\ncandour and logical honesty.  But if the subject of debate be something\nin the air, an abstraction, an excuse for talk, a logical Aunt Sally,\nthen may the male debater instantly abandon hope; he may employ reason,\nadduce facts, be supple, be smiling, be angry, all shall avail him\nnothing; what the woman said first, that (unless she has forgotten it)\nshe will repeat at the end.  Hence, at the very junctures when a talk\nbetween men grows brighter and quicker and begins to promise to bear\nfruit, talk between the sexes is menaced with dissolution.  The point of\ndifference, the point of interest, is evaded by the brilliant woman,\nunder a shower of irrelevant conversational rockets; it is bridged by the\ndiscreet woman with a rustle of silk, as she passes smoothly forward to\nthe nearest point of safety.  And this sort of prestidigitation, juggling\nthe dangerous topic out of sight until it can be reintroduced with safety\nin an altered shape, is a piece of tactics among the true drawing-room\nqueens.\n\nThe drawing-room is, indeed, an artificial place; it is so by our choice\nand for our sins.  The subjection of women; the ideal imposed upon them\nfrom the cradle, and worn, like a hair-shirt, with so much constancy;\ntheir motherly, superior tenderness to man’s vanity and self-importance;\ntheir managing arts—the arts of a civilised slave among good-natured\nbarbarians—are all painful ingredients and all help to falsify relations.\nIt is not till we get clear of that amusing artificial scene that genuine\nrelations are founded, or ideas honestly compared.  In the garden, on the\nroad or the hillside, or _tête-à-tête_ and apart from interruptions,\noccasions arise when we may learn much from any single woman; and nowhere\nmore often than in married life.  Marriage is one long conversation,\nchequered by disputes.  The disputes are valueless; they but ingrain the\ndifference; the heroic heart of woman prompting her at once to nail her\ncolours to the mast.  But in the intervals, almost unconsciously and with\nno desire to shine, the whole material of life is turned over and over,\nideas are struck out and shared, the two persons more and more adapt\ntheir notions one to suit the other, and in process of time, without\nsound of trumpet, they conduct each other into new worlds of thought.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. THE CHARACTER OF DOGS\n\n\nThe civilisation, the manners, and the morals of dog-kind are to a great\nextent subordinated to those of his ancestral master, man.  This animal,\nin many ways so superior, has accepted a position of inferiority, shares\nthe domestic life, and humours the caprices of the tyrant.  But the\npotentate, like the British in India, pays small regard to the character\nof his willing client, judges him with listless glances, and condemns him\nin a byword.  Listless have been the looks of his admirers, who have\nexhausted idle terms of praise, and buried the poor soul below\nexaggerations.  And yet more idle and, if possible, more unintelligent\nhas been the attitude of his express detractors; those who are very fond\nof dogs “but in their proper place”; who say “poo’ fellow, poo’ fellow,”\nand are themselves far poorer; who whet the knife of the vivisectionist\nor heat his oven; who are not ashamed to admire “the creature’s\ninstinct”; and flying far beyond folly, have dared to resuscitate the\ntheory of animal machines.  The “dog’s instinct” and the “automaton-dog,”\nin this age of psychology and science, sound like strange anachronisms.\nAn automaton he certainly is; a machine working independently of his\ncontrol, the heart, like the mill-wheel, keeping all in motion, and the\nconsciousness, like a person shut in the mill garret, enjoying the view\nout of the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones; an automaton\nin one corner of which a living spirit is confined: an automaton like\nman.  Instinct again he certainly possesses.  Inherited aptitudes are\nhis, inherited frailties.  Some things he at once views and understands,\nas though he were awakened from a sleep, as though he came “trailing\nclouds of glory.”  But with him, as with man, the field of instinct is\nlimited; its utterances are obscure and occasional; and about the far\nlarger part of life both the dog and his master must conduct their steps\nby deduction and observation.\n\nThe leading distinction between dog and man, after and perhaps before the\ndifferent duration of their lives, is that the one can speak and that the\nother cannot.  The absence of the power of speech confines the dog in the\ndevelopment of his intellect.  It hinders him from many speculations, for\nwords are the beginning of meta-physic.  At the same blow it saves him\nfrom many superstitions, and his silence has won for him a higher name\nfor virtue than his conduct justifies.  The faults of the dog are many.\nHe is vainer than man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant\nof ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of frenzy,\nand radically devoid of truth.  The day of an intelligent small dog is\npassed in the manufacture and the laborious communication of falsehood;\nhe lies with his tail, he lies with his eye, he lies with his protesting\npaw; and when he rattles his dish or scratches at the door his purpose is\nother than appears.  But he has some apology to offer for the vice.  Many\nof the signs which form his dialect have come to bear an arbitrary\nmeaning, clearly understood both by his master and himself; yet when a\nnew want arises he must either invent a new vehicle of meaning or wrest\nan old one to a different purpose; and this necessity frequently\nrecurring must tend to lessen his idea of the sanctity of symbols.\nMeanwhile the dog is clear in his own conscience, and draws, with a human\nnicety, the distinction between formal and essential truth.  Of his\npunning perversions, his legitimate dexterity with symbols, he is even\nvain; but when he has told and been detected in a lie, there is not a\nhair upon his body but confesses guilt.  To a dog of gentlemanly feeling\ntheft and falsehood are disgraceful vices.  The canine, like the human,\ngentleman demands in his misdemeanours Montaigne’s “_je ne sais quoi de\ngénéreux_.”  He is never more than half ashamed of having barked or\nbitten; and for those faults into which he has been led by the desire to\nshine before a lady of his race, he retains, even under physical\ncorrection, a share of pride.  But to be caught lying, if he understands\nit, instantly uncurls his fleece.\n\nJust as among dull observers he preserves a name for truth, the dog has\nbeen credited with modesty.  It is amazing how the use of language blunts\nthe faculties of man—that because vain glory finds no vent in words,\ncreatures supplied with eyes have been unable to detect a fault so gross\nand obvious.  If a small spoiled dog were suddenly to be endowed with\nspeech, he would prate interminably, and still about himself; when we had\nfriends, we should be forced to lock him in a garret; and what with his\nwhining jealousies and his foible for falsehood, in a year’s time he\nwould have gone far to weary out our love.  I was about to compare him to\nSir Willoughby Patterne, but the Patternes have a manlier sense of their\nown merits; and the parallel, besides, is ready.  Hans Christian\nAndersen, as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top\nto toe with an excruciating vanity, and scouting even along the street\nfor shadows of offence—here was the talking dog.\n\nIt is just this rage for consideration that has betrayed the dog into his\nsatellite position as the friend of man.  The cat, an animal of franker\nappetites, preserves his independence.  But the dog, with one eye ever on\nthe audience, has been wheedled into slavery, and praised and patted into\nthe renunciation of his nature.  Once he ceased hunting and became man’s\nplate-licker, the Rubicon was crossed.  Thenceforth he was a gentleman of\nleisure; and except the few whom we keep working, the whole race grew\nmore and more self-conscious, mannered and affected.  The number of\nthings that a small dog does naturally is strangely small.  Enjoying\nbetter spirits and not crushed under material cares, he is far more\ntheatrical than average man.  His whole life, if he be a dog of any\npretension to gallantry, is spent in a vain show, and in the hot pursuit\nof admiration.  Take out your puppy for a walk, and you will find the\nlittle ball of fur clumsy, stupid, bewildered, but natural.  Let but a\nfew months pass, and when you repeat the process you will find nature\nburied in convention.  He will do nothing plainly; but the simplest\nprocesses of our material life will all be bent into the forms of an\nelaborate and mysterious etiquette.  Instinct, says the fool, has\nawakened.  But it is not so.  Some dogs—some, at the very least—if they\nbe kept separate from others, remain quite natural; and these, when at\nlength they meet with a companion of experience, and have the game\nexplained to them, distinguish themselves by the severity of their\ndevotion to its rules.  I wish I were allowed to tell a story which would\nradiantly illuminate the point; but men, like dogs, have an elaborate and\nmysterious etiquette.  It is their bond of sympathy that both are the\nchildren of convention.\n\nThe person, man or dog, who has a conscience is eternally condemned to\nsome degree of humbug; the sense of the law in their members fatally\nprecipitates either towards a frozen and affected bearing.  And the\nconverse is true; and in the elaborate and conscious manners of the dog,\nmoral opinions and the love of the ideal stand confessed.  To follow for\nten minutes in the street some swaggering, canine cavalier, is to receive\na lesson in dramatic art and the cultured conduct of the body; in every\nact and gesture you see him true to a refined conception; and the dullest\ncur, beholding him, pricks up his ear and proceeds to imitate and parody\nthat charming ease.  For to be a high-mannered and high-minded gentleman,\ncareless, affable, and gay, is the inborn pretension of the dog.  The\nlarge dog, so much lazier, so much more weighed upon with matter, so\nmajestic in repose, so beautiful in effort, is born with the dramatic\nmeans to wholly represent the part.  And it is more pathetic and perhaps\nmore instructive to consider the small dog in his conscientious and\nimperfect efforts to outdo Sir Philip Sidney.  For the ideal of the dog\nis feudal and religious; the ever-present polytheism, the whip-bearing\nOlympus of mankind, rules them on the one hand; on the other, their\nsingular difference of size and strength among themselves effectually\nprevents the appearance of the democratic notion.  Or we might more\nexactly compare their society to the curious spectacle presented by a\nschool—ushers, monitors, and big and little boys—qualified by one\ncircumstance, the introduction of the other sex.  In each, we should\nobserve a somewhat similar tension of manner, and somewhat similar points\nof honour.  In each the larger animal keeps a contemptuous good humour;\nin each the smaller annoys him with wasp-like impudence, certain of\npractical immunity; in each we shall find a double life producing double\ncharacters, and an excursive and noisy heroism combined with a fair\namount of practical timidity.  I have known dogs, and I have known school\nheroes that, set aside the fur, could hardly have been told apart; and if\nwe desire to understand the chivalry of old, we must turn to the school\nplayfields or the dungheap where the dogs are trooping.\n\nWoman, with the dog, has been long enfranchised.  Incessant massacre of\nfemale innocents has changed the proportions of the sexes and perverted\ntheir relations.  Thus, when we regard the manners of the dog, we see a\nromantic and monogamous animal, once perhaps as delicate as the cat, at\nwar with impossible conditions.  Man has much to answer for; and the part\nhe plays is yet more damnable and parlous than Corin’s in the eyes of\nTouchstone.  But his intervention has at least created an imperial\nsituation for the rare surviving ladies.  In that society they reign\nwithout a rival: conscious queens; and in the only instance of a canine\nwife-beater that has ever fallen under my notice, the criminal was\nsomewhat excused by the circumstances of his story.  He is a little, very\nalert, well-bred, intelligent Skye, as black as a hat, with a wet bramble\nfor a nose and two cairngorms for eyes.  To the human observer, he is\ndecidedly well-looking; but to the ladies of his race he seems abhorrent.\nA thorough elaborate gentleman, of the plume and sword-knot order, he was\nborn with a nice sense of gallantry to women.  He took at their hands the\nmost outrageous treatment; I have heard him bleating like a sheep, I have\nseen him streaming blood, and his ear tattered like a regimental banner;\nand yet he would scorn to make reprisals.  Nay more, when a human lady\nupraised the contumelious whip against the very dame who had been so\ncruelly misusing him, my little great-heart gave but one hoarse cry and\nfell upon the tyrant tooth and nail.  This is the tale of a soul’s\ntragedy.  After three years of unavailing chivalry, he suddenly, in one\nhour, threw off the yoke of obligation; had he been Shakespeare he would\nthen have written _Troilus and Cressida_ to brand the offending sex; but\nbeing only a little dog, he began to bite them.  The surprise of the\nladies whom he attacked indicated the monstrosity of his offence; but he\nhad fairly beaten off his better angel, fairly committed moral suicide;\nfor almost in the same hour, throwing aside the last rags of decency, he\nproceeded to attack the aged also.  The fact is worth remark, showing, as\nit does, that ethical laws are common both to dogs and men; and that with\nboth a single deliberate violation of the conscience loosens all.  “But\nwhile the lamp holds on to burn,” says the paraphrase, “the greatest\nsinner may return.”  I have been cheered to see symptoms of effectual\npenitence in my sweet ruffian; and by the handling that he accepted\nuncomplainingly the other day from an indignant fair one, I begin to hope\nthe period of _Sturm und Drang_ is closed.\n\nAll these little gentlemen are subtle casuists.  The duty to the female\ndog is plain; but where competing duties rise, down they will sit and\nstudy them out, like Jesuit confessors.  I knew another little Skye,\nsomewhat plain in manner and appearance, but a creature compact of\namiability and solid wisdom.  His family going abroad for a winter, he\nwas received for that period by an uncle in the same city.  The winter\nover, his own family home again, and his own house (of which he was very\nproud) reopened, he found himself in a dilemma between two conflicting\nduties of loyalty and gratitude.  His old friends were not to be\nneglected, but it seemed hardly decent to desert the new.  This was how\nhe solved the problem.  Every morning, as soon as the door was opened,\noff posted Coolin to his uncle’s, visited the children in the nursery,\nsaluted the whole family, and was back at home in time for breakfast and\nhis bit of fish.  Nor was this done without a sacrifice on his part,\nsharply felt; for he had to forego the particular honour and jewel of his\nday—his morning’s walk with my father.  And, perhaps from this cause, he\ngradually wearied of and relaxed the practice, and at length returned\nentirely to his ancient habits.  But the same decision served him in\nanother and more distressing case of divided duty, which happened not\nlong after.  He was not at all a kitchen dog, but the cook had nursed him\nwith unusual kindness during the distemper; and though he did not adore\nher as he adored my father—although (born snob) he was critically\nconscious of her position as “only a servant”—he still cherished for her\na special gratitude.  Well, the cook left, and retired some streets away\nto lodgings of her own; and there was Coolin in precisely the same\nsituation with any young gentleman who has had the inestimable benefit of\na faithful nurse.  The canine conscience did not solve the problem with a\npound of tea at Christmas.  No longer content to pay a flying visit, it\nwas the whole forenoon that he dedicated to his solitary friend.  And so,\nday by day, he continued to comfort her solitude until (for some reason\nwhich I could never understand and cannot approve) he was kept locked up\nto break him of the graceful habit.  Here, it is not the similarity, it\nis the difference, that is worthy of remark; the clearly marked degrees\nof gratitude and the proportional duration of his visits.  Anything\nfurther removed from instinct it were hard to fancy; and one is even\nstirred to a certain impatience with a character so destitute of\nspontaneity, so passionless in justice, and so priggishly obedient to the\nvoice of reason.\n\nThere are not many dogs like this good Coolin, and not many people.  But\nthe type is one well marked, both in the human and the canine family.\nGallantry was not his aim, but a solid and somewhat oppressive\nrespectability.  He was a sworn foe to the unusual and the conspicuous, a\npraiser of the golden mean, a kind of city uncle modified by Cheeryble.\nAnd as he was precise and conscientious in all the steps of his own\nblameless course, he looked for the same precision and an even greater\ngravity in the bearing of his deity, my father.  It was no sinecure to be\nCoolin’s idol: he was exacting like a rigid parent; and at every sign of\nlevity in the man whom he respected, he announced loudly the death of\nvirtue and the proximate fall of the pillars of the earth.\n\nI have called him a snob; but all dogs are so, though in varying degrees.\nIt is hard to follow their snobbery among themselves; for though I think\nwe can perceive distinctions of rank, we cannot grasp what is the\ncriterion.  Thus in Edinburgh, in a good part of the town, there were\nseveral distinct societies or clubs that met in the morning to—the phrase\nis technical—to “rake the backets” in a troop.  A friend of mine, the\nmaster of three dogs, was one day surprised to observe that they had left\none club and joined another; but whether it was a rise or a fall, and the\nresult of an invitation or an expulsion, was more than he could guess.\nAnd this illustrates pointedly our ignorance of the real life of dogs,\ntheir social ambitions and their social hierarchies.  At least, in their\ndealings with men they are not only conscious of sex, but of the\ndifference of station.  And that in the most snobbish manner; for the\npoor man’s dog is not offended by the notice of the rich, and keeps all\nhis ugly feeling for those poorer or more ragged than his master.  And\nagain, for every station they have an ideal of behaviour, to which the\nmaster, under pain of derogation, will do wisely to conform.  How often\nhas not a cold glance of an eye informed me that my dog was disappointed;\nand how much more gladly would he not have taken a beating than to be\nthus wounded in the seat of piety!\n\nI knew one disrespectable dog.  He was far liker a cat; cared little or\nnothing for men, with whom he merely coexisted as we do with cattle, and\nwas entirely devoted to the art of poaching.  A house would not hold him,\nand to live in a town was what he refused.  He led, I believe, a life of\ntroubled but genuine pleasure, and perished beyond all question in a\ntrap.  But this was an exception, a marked reversion to the ancestral\ntype; like the hairy human infant.  The true dog of the nineteenth\ncentury, to judge by the remainder of my fairly large acquaintance, is in\nlove with respectability.  A street-dog was once adopted by a lady.\nWhile still an Arab, he had done as Arabs do, gambolling in the mud,\ncharging into butchers’ stalls, a cat-hunter, a sturdy beggar, a common\nrogue and vagabond; but with his rise into society he laid aside these\ninconsistent pleasures.  He stole no more, he hunted no more cats; and\nconscious of his collar, he ignored his old companions.  Yet the canine\nupper class was never brought to recognise the upstart, and from that\nhour, except for human countenance, he was alone.  Friendless, shorn of\nhis sports and the habits of a lifetime, he still lived in a glory of\nhappiness, content with his acquired respectability, and with no care but\nto support it solemnly.  Are we to condemn or praise this self-made dog?\nWe praise his human brother.  And thus to conquer vicious habits is as\nrare with dogs as with men.  With the more part, for all their\nscruple-mongering and moral thought, the vices that are born with them\nremain invincible throughout; and they live all their years, glorying in\ntheir virtues, but still the slaves of their defects.  Thus the sage\nCoolin was a thief to the last; among a thousand peccadilloes, a whole\ngoose and a whole cold leg of mutton lay upon his conscience; but Woggs,\n{128} whose soul’s shipwreck in the matter of gallantry I have recounted\nabove, has only twice been known to steal, and has often nobly conquered\nthe temptation.  The eighth is his favourite commandment.  There is\nsomething painfully human in these unequal virtues and mortal frailties\nof the best.  Still more painful is the bearing of those “stammering\nprofessors” in the house of sickness and under the terror of death.  It\nis beyond a doubt to me that, somehow or other, the dog connects\ntogether, or confounds, the uneasiness of sickness and the consciousness\nof guilt.  To the pains of the body he often adds the tortures of the\nconscience; and at these times his haggard protestations form, in regard\nto the human deathbed, a dreadful parody or parallel.\n\nI once supposed that I had found an inverse relation between the double\netiquette which dogs obey; and that those who were most addicted to the\nshowy street life among other dogs were less careful in the practice of\nhome virtues for the tyrant man.  But the female dog, that mass of\ncarneying affectations, shines equally in either sphere; rules her rough\nposse of attendant swains with unwearying tact and gusto; and with her\nmaster and mistress pushes the arts of insinuation to their crowning\npoint.  The attention of man and the regard of other dogs flatter (it\nwould thus appear) the same sensibility; but perhaps, if we could read\nthe canine heart, they would be found to flatter it in very different\ndegrees.  Dogs live with man as courtiers round a monarch, steeped in the\nflattery of his notice and enriched with sinecures.  To push their favour\nin this world of pickings and caresses is, perhaps, the business of their\nlives; and their joys may lie outside.  I am in despair at our persistent\nignorance.  I read in the lives of our companions the same processes of\nreason, the same antique and fatal conflicts of the right against the\nwrong, and of unbitted nature with too rigid custom; I see them with our\nweaknesses, vain, false, inconstant against appetite, and with our one\nstalk of virtue, devoted to the dream of an ideal; and yet, as they hurry\nby me on the street with tail in air, or come singly to solicit my\nregard, I must own the secret purport of their lives is still inscrutable\nto man.  Is man the friend, or is he the patron only?  Have they indeed\nforgotten nature’s voice? or are those moments snatched from courtiership\nwhen they touch noses with the tinker’s mongrel, the brief reward and\npleasure of their artificial lives?  Doubtless, when man shares with his\ndog the toils of a profession and the pleasures of an art, as with the\nshepherd or the poacher, the affection warms and strengthens till it\nfills the soul.  But doubtless, also, the masters are, in many cases, the\nobject of a merely interested cultus, sitting aloft like Louis Quatorze,\ngiving and receiving flattery and favour; and the dogs, like the majority\nof men, have but foregone their true existence and become the dupes of\ntheir ambition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. A PENNY PLAIN AND TWOPENCE COLOURED\n\n\nThese words will be familiar to all students of Skelt’s Juvenile Drama.\nThat national monument, after having changed its name to Park’s, to\nWebb’s, to Redington’s, and last of all to Pollock’s, has now become, for\nthe most part, a memory.  Some of its pillars, like Stonehenge, are still\nafoot, the rest clean vanished.  It may be the Museum numbers a full set;\nand Mr. Ionides perhaps, or else her gracious Majesty, may boast their\ngreat collections; but to the plain private person they are become, like\nRaphaels, unattainable.  I have, at different times, possessed _Aladdin_,\n_The Red Rover_, _The Blind Boy_, _The Old Oak Chest_, _The Wood Dæmon_,\n_Jack Sheppard_, _The Miller and his Men_, _Der Freischütz_, _The\nSmuggler_, _The Forest of Bondy_, _Robin Hood_, _The Waterman_, _Richard\nI._, _My Poll and my Partner Joe_, _The Inchcape Bell_ (imperfect), and\n_Three-Fingered Jack_, _The Terror of Jamaica_; and I have assisted\nothers in the illumination of _Maid of the Inn_ and _The Battle of\nWaterloo_.  In this roll-call of stirring names you read the evidences of\na happy childhood; and though not half of them are still to be procured\nof any living stationer, in the mind of their once happy owner all\nsurvive, kaleidoscopes of changing pictures, echoes of the past.\n\nThere stands, I fancy, to this day (but now how fallen!) a certain\nstationer’s shop at a corner of the wide thoroughfare that joins the city\nof my childhood with the sea.  When, upon any Saturday, we made a party\nto behold the ships, we passed that corner; and since in those days I\nloved a ship as a man loves Burgundy or daybreak, this of itself had been\nenough to hallow it.  But there was more than that.  In the Leith Walk\nwindow, all the year round, there stood displayed a theatre in working\norder, with a “forest set,” a “combat,” and a few “robbers carousing” in\nthe slides; and below and about, dearer tenfold to me! the plays\nthemselves, those budgets of romance, lay tumbled one upon another.  Long\nand often have I lingered there with empty pockets.  One figure, we shall\nsay, was visible in the first plate of characters, bearded, pistol in\nhand, or drawing to his ear the clothyard arrow; I would spell the name:\nwas it Macaire, or Long Tom Coffin, or Grindoff, 2d dress?  O, how I\nwould long to see the rest! how—if the name by chance were hidden—I would\nwonder in what play he figured, and what immortal legend justified his\nattitude and strange apparel!  And then to go within, to announce\nyourself as an intending purchaser, and, closely watched, be suffered to\nundo those bundles and breathlessly devour those pages of gesticulating\nvillains, epileptic combats, bosky forests, palaces and war-ships,\nfrowning fortresses and prison vaults—it was a giddy joy.  That shop,\nwhich was dark and smelt of Bibles, was a loadstone rock for all that\nbore the name of boy.  They could not pass it by, nor, having entered,\nleave it.  It was a place besieged; the shopmen, like the Jews rebuilding\nSalem, had a double task.  They kept us at the stick’s end, frowned us\ndown, snatched each play out of our hand ere we were trusted with\nanother, and, increditable as it may sound, used to demand of us upon our\nentrance, like banditti, if we came with money or with empty hand.  Old\nMr. Smith himself, worn out with my eternal vacillation, once swept the\ntreasures from before me, with the cry: “I do not believe, child, that\nyou are an intending purchaser at all!”  These were the dragons of the\ngarden; but for such joys of paradise we could have faced the Terror of\nJamaica himself.  Every sheet we fingered was another lightning glance\ninto obscure, delicious story; it was like wallowing in the raw stuff of\nstory-books.  I know nothing to compare with it save now and then in\ndreams, when I am privileged to read in certain unwrit stories of\nadventure, from which I awake to find the world all vanity.  The _crux_\nof Buridan’s donkey was as nothing to the uncertainty of the boy as he\nhandled and lingered and doated on these bundles of delight; there was a\nphysical pleasure in the sight and touch of them which he would jealously\nprolong; and when at length the deed was done, the play selected, and the\nimpatient shopman had brushed the rest into the gray portfolio, and the\nboy was forth again, a little late for dinner, the lamps springing into\nlight in the blue winter’s even, and _The Miller_, or _The Rover_, or\nsome kindred drama clutched against his side—on what gay feet he ran, and\nhow he laughed aloud in exultation!  I can hear that laughter still.  Out\nof all the years of my life, I can recall but one home-coming to compare\nwith these, and that was on the night when I brought back with me the\n_Arabian Entertainments_ in the fat, old, double-columned volume with the\nprints.  I was just well into the story of the Hunchback, I remember,\nwhen my clergyman-grandfather (a man we counted pretty stiff) came in\nbehind me.  I grew blind with terror.  But instead of ordering the book\naway, he said he envied me.  Ah, well he might!\n\nThe purchase and the first half-hour at home, that was the summit.\nThenceforth the interest declined by little and little.  The fable, as\nset forth in the play-book, proved to be not worthy of the scenes and\ncharacters: what fable would not?  Such passages as: “Scene 6. The\nHermitage.  Night set scene.  Place back of scene 1, No. 2, at back of\nstage and hermitage, Fig. 2, out of set piece, R. H. in a slanting\ndirection”—such passages, I say, though very practical, are hardly to be\ncalled good reading.  Indeed, as literature, these dramas did not much\nappeal to me.  I forget the very outline of the plots.  Of _The Blind\nBoy_, beyond the fact that he was a most injured prince and once, I\nthink, abducted, I know nothing.  And _The Old Oak Chest_, what was it\nall about? that proscript (1st dress), that prodigious number of\nbanditti, that old woman with the broom, and the magnificent kitchen in\nthe third act (was it in the third?)—they are all fallen in a deliquium,\nswim faintly in my brain, and mix and vanish.\n\nI cannot deny that joy attended the illumination; nor can I quite forget\nthat child who, wilfully foregoing pleasure, stoops to “twopence\ncoloured.”  With crimson lake (hark to the sound of it—crimson lake!—the\nhorns of elf-land are not richer on the ear)—with crimson lake and\nPrussian blue a certain purple is to be compounded which, for cloaks\nespecially, Titian could not equal.  The latter colour with gamboge, a\nhated name although an exquisite pigment, supplied a green of such a\nsavoury greenness that to-day my heart regrets it.  Nor can I recall\nwithout a tender weakness the very aspect of the water where I dipped my\nbrush.  Yes, there was pleasure in the painting.  But when all was\npainted, it is needless to deny it, all was spoiled.  You might, indeed,\nset up a scene or two to look at; but to cut the figures out was simply\nsacrilege; nor could any child twice court the tedium, the worry, and the\nlong-drawn disenchantment of an actual performance.  Two days after the\npurchase the honey had been sucked.  Parents used to complain; they\nthought I wearied of my play.  It was not so: no more than a person can\nbe said to have wearied of his dinner when he leaves the bones and\ndishes; I had got the marrow of it and said grace.\n\nThen was the time to turn to the back of the play-book and to study that\nenticing double file of names, where poetry, for the true child of Skelt,\nreigned happy and glorious like her Majesty the Queen.  Much as I have\ntravelled in these realms of gold, I have yet seen, upon that map or\nabstract, names of El Dorados that still haunt the ear of memory, and are\nstill but names.  _The Floating Beacon_—why was that denied me? or _The\nWreck Ashore_?  _Sixteen-String Jack_ whom I did not even guess to be a\nhighwayman, troubled me awake and haunted my slumbers; and there is one\nsequence of three from that enchanted calender that I still at times\nrecall, like a loved verse of poetry: _Lodoiska_, _Silver Palace_, _Echo\nof Westminster Bridge_.  Names, bare names, are surely more to children\nthan we poor, grown-up, obliterated fools remember.\n\nThe name of Skelt itself has always seemed a part and parcel of the charm\nof his productions.  It may be different with the rose, but the\nattraction of this paper drama sensibly declined when Webb had crept into\nthe rubric: a poor cuckoo, flaunting in Skelt’s nest.  And now we have\nreached Pollock, sounding deeper gulfs.  Indeed, this name of Skelt\nappears so stagey and piratic, that I will adopt it boldly to design\nthese qualities.  Skeltery, then, is a quality of much art.  It is even\nto be found, with reverence be it said, among the works of nature.  The\nstagey is its generic name; but it is an old, insular, home-bred\nstaginess; not French, domestically British; not of to-day, but smacking\nof O. Smith, Fitzball, and the great age of melodrama: a peculiar\nfragrance haunting it; uttering its unimportant message in a tone of\nvoice that has the charm of fresh antiquity.  I will not insist upon the\nart of Skelt’s purveyors.  These wonderful characters that once so\nthrilled our soul with their bold attitude, array of deadly engines and\nincomparable costume, to-day look somewhat pallidly; the extreme hard\nfavour of the heroine strikes me, I had almost said with pain; the\nvillain’s scowl no longer thrills me like a trumpet; and the scenes\nthemselves, those once unparalleled landscapes, seem the efforts of a\nprentice hand.  So much of fault we find; but on the other side the\nimpartial critic rejoices to remark the presence of a great unity of\ngusto; of those direct clap-trap appeals, which a man is dead and\nburiable when he fails to answer; of the footlight glamour, the\nready-made, bare-faced, transpontine picturesque, a thing not one with\ncold reality, but how much dearer to the mind!\n\nThe scenery of Skeltdom—or, shall we say, the kingdom of Transpontus?—had\na prevailing character.  Whether it set forth Poland as in _The Blind\nBoy_, or Bohemia with _The Miller and his Men_, or Italy with _The Old\nOak Chest_, still it was Transpontus.  A botanist could tell it by the\nplants.  The hollyhock was all pervasive, running wild in deserts; the\ndock was common, and the bending reed; and overshadowing these were\npoplar, palm, potato tree, and _Quercus Skeltica_—brave growths.  The\ncaves were all embowelled in the Surreyside formation; the soil was all\nbetrodden by the light pump of T. P. Cooke.  Skelt, to be sure, had yet\nanother, an oriental string: he held the gorgeous east in fee; and in the\nnew quarter of Hyères, say, in the garden of the Hotel des Iles d’Or, you\nmay behold these blessed visions realised.  But on these I will not\ndwell; they were an outwork; it was in the occidental scenery that Skelt\nwas all himself.  It had a strong flavour of England; it was a sort of\nindigestion of England and drop-scenes, and I am bound to say was\ncharming.  How the roads wander, how the castle sits upon the hill, how\nthe sun eradiates from behind the cloud, and how the congregated clouds\nthemselves up-roll, as stiff as bolsters!  Here is the cottage interior,\nthe usual first flat, with the cloak upon the nail, the rosaries of\nonions, the gun and powder-horn and corner-cupboard; here is the inn\n(this drama must be nautical, I foresee Captain Luff and Bold Bob\nBowsprit) with the red curtain, pipes, spittoons, and eight-day clock;\nand there again is that impressive dungeon with the chains, which was so\ndull to colour.  England, the hedgerow elms, the thin brick houses,\nwindmills, glimpses of the navigable Thames—England, when at last I came\nto visit it, was only Skelt made evident: to cross the border was, for\nthe Scotsman, to come home to Skelt; there was the inn-sign and there the\nhorse-trough, all foreshadowed in the faithful Skelt.  If, at the ripe\nage of fourteen years, I bought a certain cudgel, got a friend to load\nit, and thenceforward walked the tame ways of the earth my own ideal,\nradiating pure romance—still I was but a puppet in the hand of Skelt; the\noriginal of that regretted bludgeon, and surely the antitype of all the\nbludgeon kind, greatly improved from Cruikshank, had adorned the hand of\nJonathan Wild, pl. I.  “This is mastering me,” as Whitman cries, upon\nsome lesser provocation.  What am I? what are life, art, letters, the\nworld, but what my Skelt has made them?  He stamped himself upon my\nimmaturity.  The world was plain before I knew him, a poor penny world;\nbut soon it was all coloured with romance.  If I go to the theatre to see\na good old melodrama, ’tis but Skelt a little faded.  If I visit a bold\nscene in nature, Skelt would have been bolder; there had been certainly a\ncastle on that mountain, and the hollow tree—that set piece—I seem to\nmiss it in the foreground.  Indeed, out of this cut-and-dry, dull,\nswaggering, obtrusive, and infantile art, I seem to have learned the very\nspirit of my life’s enjoyment; met there the shadows of the characters I\nwas to read about and love in a late future; got the romance of _Der\nFreischütz_ long ere I was to hear of Weber or the mighty Formes;\nacquired a gallery of scenes and characters with which, in the silent\ntheatre of the brain, I might enact all novels and romances; and took\nfrom these rude cuts an enduring and transforming pleasure.  Reader—and\nyourself?\n\nA word of moral: it appears that B. Pollock, late J. Redington, No. 73\nHoxton Street, not only publishes twenty-three of these old stage\nfavourites, but owns the necessary plates and displays a modest readiness\nto issue other thirty-three.  If you love art, folly, or the bright eyes\nof children, speed to Pollock’s, or to Clarke’s of Garrick Street.  In\nPollock’s list of publicanda I perceive a pair of my ancient aspirations:\n_Wreck Ashore_ and _Sixteen-String Jack_; and I cherish the belief that\nwhen these shall see once more the light of day, B. Pollock will remember\nthis apologist.  But, indeed, I have a dream at times that is not all a\ndream.  I seem to myself to wander in a ghostly street—E. W., I think,\nthe postal district—close below the fool’s-cap of St. Paul’s, and yet\nwithin easy hearing of the echo of the Abbey bridge.  There in a dim\nshop, low in the roof and smelling strong of glue and footlights, I find\nmyself in quaking treaty with great Skelt himself, the aboriginal all\ndusty from the tomb.  I buy, with what a choking heart—I buy them all,\nall but the pantomimes; I pay my mental money, and go forth; and lo! the\npackets are dust.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. A GOSSIP ON A NOVEL OF DUMAS’S\n\n\nThe books that we re-read the oftenest are not always those that we\nadmire the most; we choose and we re-visit them for many and various\nreasons, as we choose and revisit human friends.  One or two of Scott’s\nnovels, Shakespeare, Molière, Montaigne, _The Egoist_, and the _Vicomte\nde Bragelonne_, form the inner circle of my intimates.  Behind these\ncomes a good troop of dear acquaintances; _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ in the\nfront rank, _The Bible in Spain_ not far behind.  There are besides a\ncertain number that look at me with reproach as I pass them by on my\nshelves: books that I once thumbed and studied: houses which were once\nlike home to me, but where I now rarely visit.  I am on these sad terms\n(and blush to confess it) with Wordsworth, Horace, Burns and Hazlitt.\nLast of all, there is the class of book that has its hour of\nbrilliancy—glows, sings, charms, and then fades again into insignificance\nuntil the fit return.  Chief of those who thus smile and frown on me by\nturns, I must name Virgil and Herrick, who, were they but\n\n    “Their sometime selves the same throughout the year,”\n\nmust have stood in the first company with the six names of my continual\nliterary intimates.  To these six, incongruous as they seem, I have long\nbeen faithful, and hope to be faithful to the day of death.  I have never\nread the whole of Montaigne, but I do not like to be long without reading\nsome of him, and my delight in what I do read never lessens.  Of\nShakespeare I have read all but _Richard III._, _Henry VI._, _Titus\nAndronicus_, and _All’s Well that Ends Well_; and these, having already\nmade all suitable endeavour, I now know that I shall never read—to make\nup for which unfaithfulness I could read much of the rest for ever.  Of\nMolière—surely the next greatest name of Christendom—I could tell a very\nsimilar story; but in a little corner of a little essay these princes are\ntoo much out of place, and I prefer to pay my fealty and pass on.  How\noften I have read _Guy Mannering_, _Rob Roy_, or _Redgauntlet_, I have no\nmeans of guessing, having begun young.  But it is either four or five\ntimes that I have read _The Egoist_, and either five or six that I have\nread the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_.\n\nSome, who would accept the others, may wonder that I should have spent so\nmuch of this brief life of ours over a work so little famous as the last.\nAnd, indeed, I am surprised myself; not at my own devotion, but the\ncoldness of the world.  My acquaintance with the _Vicomte_ began,\nsomewhat indirectly, in the year of grace 1863, when I had the advantage\nof studying certain illustrated dessert plates in a hotel at Nice.  The\nname of d’Artagnan in the legends I already saluted like an old friend,\nfor I had met it the year before in a work of Miss Yonge’s.  My first\nperusal was in one of those pirated editions that swarmed at that time\nout of Brussels, and ran to such a troop of neat and dwarfish volumes.  I\nunderstood but little of the merits of the book; my strongest memory is\nof the execution of d’Eyméric and Lyodot—a strange testimony to the\ndulness of a boy, who could enjoy the rough-and-tumble in the Place de\nGrêve, and forget d’Artagnan’s visits to the two financiers.  My next\nreading was in winter-time, when I lived alone upon the Pentlands.  I\nwould return in the early night from one of my patrols with the shepherd;\na friendly face would meet me in the door, a friendly retriever scurry\nupstairs to fetch my slippers; and I would sit down with the _Vicomte_\nfor a long, silent, solitary lamp-light evening by the fire.  And yet I\nknow not why I call it silent, when it was enlivened with such a clatter\nof horse-shoes, and such a rattle of musketry, and such a stir of talk;\nor why I call those evenings solitary in which I gained so many friends.\nI would rise from my book and pull the blind aside, and see the snow and\nthe glittering hollies chequer a Scotch garden, and the winter moonlight\nbrighten the white hills.  Thence I would turn again to that crowded and\nsunny field of life in which it was so easy to forget myself, my cares,\nand my surroundings: a place busy as a city, bright as a theatre,\nthronged with memorable faces, and sounding with delightful speech.  I\ncarried the thread of that epic into my slumbers, I woke with it\nunbroken, I rejoiced to plunge into the book again at breakfast, it was\nwith a pang that I must lay it down and turn to my own labours; for no\npart of the world has ever seemed to me so charming as these pages, and\nnot even my friends are quite so real, perhaps quite so dear, as\nd’Artagnan.\n\nSince then I have been going to and fro at very brief intervals in my\nfavourite book; and I have now just risen from my last (let me call it my\nfifth) perusal, having liked it better and admired it more seriously than\never.  Perhaps I have a sense of ownership, being so well known in these\nsix volumes.  Perhaps I think that d’Artagnan delights to have me read of\nhim, and Louis Quatorze is gratified, and Fouquet throws me a look, and\nAramis, although he knows I do not love him, yet plays to me with his\nbest graces, as to an old patron of the show.  Perhaps, if I am not\ncareful, something may befall me like what befell George IV. about the\nbattle of Waterloo, and I may come to fancy the _Vicomte_ one of the\nfirst, and Heaven knows the best, of my own works.  At least, I avow\nmyself a partisan; and when I compare the popularity of the _Vicomte_\nwith that of _Monte Cristo_, or its own elder brother, the _Trois\nMousquetaires_, I confess I am both pained and puzzled.\n\nTo those who have already made acquaintance with the titular hero in the\npages of _Vingt Ans Après_, perhaps the name may act as a deterrent.  A\nman might, well stand back if he supposed he were to follow, for six\nvolumes, so well-conducted, so fine-spoken, and withal so dreary a\ncavalier as Bragelonne.  But the fear is idle.  I may be said to have\npassed the best years of my life in these six volumes, and my\nacquaintance with Raoul has never gone beyond a bow; and when he, who has\nso long pretended to be alive, is at last suffered to pretend to be dead,\nI am sometimes reminded of a saying in an earlier volume: “_Enfin_, _dit\nMiss Stewart_,”—and it was of Bragelonne she spoke—“_enfin il a fait\nquelquechose_: _c’est_, _ma foi_! _bien heureux_.”  I am reminded of it,\nas I say; and the next moment, when Athos dies of his death, and my dear\nd’Artagnan bursts into his storm of sobbing, I can but deplore my\nflippancy.\n\nOr perhaps it is La Vallière that the reader of _Vingt Ans Après_ is\ninclined to flee.  Well, he is right there too, though not so right.\nLouise is no success.  Her creator has spared no pains; she is\nwell-meant, not ill-designed, sometimes has a word that rings out true;\nsometimes, if only for a breath, she may even engage our sympathies.  But\nI have never envied the King his triumph.  And so far from pitying\nBragelonne for his defeat, I could wish him no worse (not for lack of\nmalice, but imagination) than to be wedded to that lady.  Madame enchants\nme; I can forgive that royal minx her most serious offences; I can thrill\nand soften with the King on that memorable occasion when he goes to\nupbraid and remains to flirt; and when it comes to the “_Allons_,\n_aimez-moi donc_,” it is my heart that melts in the bosom of de Guiche.\nNot so with Louise.  Readers cannot fail to have remarked that what an\nauthor tells us of the beauty or the charm of his creatures goes for\nnought; that we know instantly better; that the heroine cannot open her\nmouth but what, all in a moment, the fine phrases of preparation fall\nfrom round her like the robes from Cinderella, and she stands before us,\nself-betrayed, as a poor, ugly, sickly wench, or perhaps a strapping\nmarket-woman.  Authors, at least, know it well; a heroine will too often\nstart the trick of “getting ugly;” and no disease is more difficult to\ncure.  I said authors; but indeed I had a side eye to one author in\nparticular, with whose works I am very well acquainted, though I cannot\nread them, and who has spent many vigils in this cause, sitting beside\nhis ailing puppets and (like a magician) wearying his art to restore them\nto youth and beauty.  There are others who ride too high for these\nmisfortunes.  Who doubts the loveliness of Rosalind?  Arden itself was\nnot more lovely.  Who ever questioned the perennial charm of Rose\nJocelyn, Lucy Desborough, or Clara Middleton? fair women with fair names,\nthe daughters of George Meredith.  Elizabeth Bennet has but to speak, and\nI am at her knees.  Ah! these are the creators of desirable women.  They\nwould never have fallen in the mud with Dumas and poor La Vallière.  It\nis my only consolation that not one of all of them, except the first,\ncould have plucked at the moustache of d’Artagnan.\n\nOr perhaps, again, a proportion of readers stumble at the threshold.  In\nso vast a mansion there were sure to be back stairs and kitchen offices\nwhere no one would delight to linger; but it was at least unhappy that\nthe vestibule should be so badly lighted; and until, in the seventeenth\nchapter, d’Artagnan sets off to seek his friends, I must confess, the\nbook goes heavily enough.  But, from thenceforward, what a feast is\nspread!  Monk kidnapped; d’Artagnan enriched; Mazarin’s death; the ever\ndelectable adventure of Belle Isle, wherein Aramis outwits d’Artagnan,\nwith its epilogue (vol. v. chap. xxviii.), where d’Artagnan regains the\nmoral superiority; the love adventures at Fontainebleau, with St.\nAignan’s story of the dryad and the business of de Guiche, de Wardes, and\nManicamp; Aramis made general of the Jesuits; Aramis at the bastille; the\nnight talk in the forest of Sénart; Belle Isle again, with the death of\nPorthos; and last, but not least, the taming of d’Artagnan the untamable,\nunder the lash of the young King.  What other novel has such epic variety\nand nobility of incident? often, if you will, impossible; often of the\norder of an Arabian story; and yet all based in human nature.  For if you\ncome to that, what novel has more human nature? not studied with the\nmicroscope, but seen largely, in plain daylight, with the natural eye?\nWhat novel has more good sense, and gaiety, and wit, and unflagging,\nadmirable literary skill?  Good souls, I suppose, must sometimes read it\nin the blackguard travesty of a translation.  But there is no style so\nuntranslatable; light as a whipped trifle, strong as silk; wordy like a\nvillage tale; pat like a general’s despatch; with every fault, yet never\ntedious; with no merit, yet inimitably right.  And, once more, to make an\nend of commendations, what novel is inspired with a more unstrained or a\nmore wholesome morality?\n\nYes; in spite of Miss Yonge, who introduced me to the name of d’Artagnan\nonly to dissuade me from a nearer knowledge of the man, I have to add\nmorality.  There is no quite good book without a good morality; but the\nworld is wide, and so are morals.  Out of two people who have dipped into\nSir Richard Burton’s _Thousand and One Nights_, one shall have been\noffended by the animal details; another to whom these were harmless,\nperhaps even pleasing, shall yet have been shocked in his turn by the\nrascality and cruelty of all the characters.  Of two readers, again, one\nshall have been pained by the morality of a religious memoir, one by that\nof the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_.  And the point is that neither need be\nwrong.  We shall always shock each other both in life and art; we cannot\nget the sun into our pictures, nor the abstract right (if there be such a\nthing) into our books; enough if, in the one, there glimmer some hint of\nthe great light that blinds us from heaven; enough if, in the other,\nthere shine, even upon foul details, a spirit of magnanimity.  I would\nscarce send to the _Vicomte_ a reader who was in quest of what we may\ncall puritan morality.  The ventripotent mulatto, the great eater,\nworker, earner and waster, the man of much and witty laughter, the man of\nthe great heart and alas! of the doubtful honesty, is a figure not yet\nclearly set before the world; he still awaits a sober and yet genial\nportrait; but with whatever art that may be touched, and whatever\nindulgence, it will not be the portrait of a precisian.  Dumas was\ncertainly not thinking of himself, but of Planchet, when he put into the\nmouth of d’Artagnan’s old servant this excellent profession: “_Monsieur_,\n_j’étais une de ces bonnes pâtes d’hommes que Dieu a fait pour s’animer\npendant un certain temps et pour trouver bonnes toutes choses qui\naccompagnent leur séjour sur la terre_.”  He was thinking, as I say, of\nPlanchet, to whom the words are aptly fitted; but they were fitted also\nto Planchet’s creator; and perhaps this struck him as he wrote, for\nobserve what follows: “_D’Artagnan s’assit alors près de la fenêtre_,\n_et_, _cette philosophie de Planchet lui ayant paru solide_, _il y\nrêva_.”  In a man who finds all things good, you will scarce expect much\nzeal for negative virtues: the active alone will have a charm for him;\nabstinence, however wise, however kind, will always seem to such a judge\nentirely mean and partly impious.  So with Dumas.  Chastity is not near\nhis heart; nor yet, to his own sore cost, that virtue of frugality which\nis the armour of the artist.  Now, in the _Vicomte_, he had much to do\nwith the contest of Fouquet and Colbert.  Historic justice should be all\nupon the side of Colbert, of official honesty, and fiscal competence.\nAnd Dumas knew it well: three times at least he shows his knowledge; once\nit is but flashed upon us and received with the laughter of Fouquet\nhimself, in the jesting controversy in the gardens of Saint Mandé; once\nit is touched on by Aramis in the forest of Sénart; in the end, it is set\nbefore us clearly in one dignified speech of the triumphant Colbert.  But\nin Fouquet, the waster, the lover of good cheer and wit and art, the\nswift transactor of much business, “_l’homme de bruit_, _l’homme de\nplaisir_, _l’homme qui n’est que parceque les autres sont_,” Dumas saw\nsomething of himself and drew the figure the more tenderly.  It is to me\neven touching to see how he insists on Fouquet’s honour; not seeing, you\nmight think, that unflawed honour is impossible to spendthrifts; but\nrather, perhaps, in the light of his own life, seeing it too well, and\nclinging the more to what was left.  Honour can survive a wound; it can\nlive and thrive without a member.  The man rebounds from his disgrace; he\nbegins fresh foundations on the ruins of the old; and when his sword is\nbroken, he will do valiantly with his dagger.  So it is with Fouquet in\nthe book; so it was with Dumas on the battlefield of life.\n\nTo cling to what is left of any damaged quality is virtue in the man; but\nperhaps to sing its praises is scarcely to be called morality in the\nwriter.  And it is elsewhere, it is in the character of d’Artagnan, that\nwe must look for that spirit of morality, which is one of the chief\nmerits of the book, makes one of the main joys of its perusal, and sets\nit high above more popular rivals.  Athos, with the coming of years, has\ndeclined too much into the preacher, and the preacher of a sapless creed;\nbut d’Artagnan has mellowed into a man so witty, rough, kind and upright,\nthat he takes the heart by storm.  There is nothing of the copy-book\nabout his virtues, nothing of the drawing-room in his fine, natural\ncivility; he will sail near the wind; he is no district visitor—no Wesley\nor Robespierre; his conscience is void of all refinement whether for good\nor evil; but the whole man rings true like a good sovereign.  Readers who\nhave approached the _Vicomte_, not across country, but by the legitimate,\nfive-volumed avenue of the _Mousquetaires_ and _Vingt Ans Après_, will\nnot have forgotten d’Artagnan’s ungentlemanly and perfectly improbable\ntrick upon Milady.  What a pleasure it is, then, what a reward, and how\nagreeable a lesson, to see the old captain humble himself to the son of\nthe man whom he had personated!  Here, and throughout, if I am to choose\nvirtues for myself or my friends, let me choose the virtues of\nd’Artagnan.  I do not say there is no character as well drawn in\nShakespeare; I do say there is none that I love so wholly.  There are\nmany spiritual eyes that seem to spy upon our actions—eyes of the dead\nand the absent, whom we imagine to behold us in our most private hours,\nand whom we fear and scruple to offend: our witnesses and judges.  And\namong these, even if you should think me childish, I must count my\nd’Artagnan—not d’Artagnan of the memoirs whom Thackeray pretended to\nprefer—a preference, I take the freedom of saying, in which he stands\nalone; not the d’Artagnan of flesh and blood, but him of the ink and\npaper; not Nature’s, but Dumas’s.  And this is the particular crown and\ntriumph of the artist—not to be true merely, but to be lovable; not\nsimply to convince, but to enchant.\n\nThere is yet another point in the _Vicomte_ which I find incomparable.  I\ncan recall no other work of the imagination in which the end of life is\nrepresented with so nice a tact.  I was asked the other day if Dumas made\nme laugh or cry.  Well in this my late fifth reading of the _Vicomte_, I\ndid laugh once at the small Coquelin de Volière business, and was perhaps\na thought surprised at having done so: to make up for it, I smiled\ncontinually.  But for tears, I do not know.  If you put a pistol to my\nthroat, I must own the tale trips upon a very airy foot—within a\nmeasurable distance of unreality; and for those who like the big guns to\nbe discharged and the great passions to appear authentically, it may even\nseem inadequate from first to last.  Not so to me; I cannot count that a\npoor dinner, or a poor book, where I meet with those I love; and, above\nall, in this last volume, I find a singular charm of spirit.  It breathes\na pleasant and a tonic sadness, always brave, never hysterical.  Upon the\ncrowded, noisy life of this long tale, evening gradually falls; and the\nlights are extinguished, and the heroes pass away one by one.  One by one\nthey go, and not a regret embitters their departure; the young succeed\nthem in their places, Louis Quatorze is swelling larger and shining\nbroader, another generation and another France dawn on the horizon; but\nfor us and these old men whom we have loved so long, the inevitable end\ndraws near and is welcome.  To read this well is to anticipate\nexperience.  Ah, if only when these hours of the long shadows fall for us\nin reality and not in figure, we may hope to face them with a mind as\nquiet!\n\nBut my paper is running out; the siege guns are firing on the Dutch\nfrontier; and I must say adieu for the fifth time to my old comrade\nfallen on the field of glory.  _Adieu_—rather _au revoir_!  Yet a sixth\ntime, dearest d’Artagnan, we shall kidnap Monk and take horse together\nfor Belle Isle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. A GOSSIP ON ROMANCE\n\n\nIn anything fit to be called by the name of reading, the process itself\nshould be absorbing and voluptuous; we should gloat over a book, be rapt\nclean out of ourselves, and rise from the perusal, our mind filled with\nthe busiest, kaleidoscopic dance of images, incapable of sleep or of\ncontinuous thought.  The words, if the book be eloquent, should run\nthenceforward in our ears like the noise of breakers, and the story, if\nit be a story, repeat itself in a thousand coloured pictures to the eye.\nIt was for this last pleasure that we read so closely, and loved our\nbooks so dearly, in the bright, troubled period of boyhood.  Eloquence\nand thought, character and conversation, were but obstacles to brush\naside as we dug blithely after a certain sort of incident, like a pig for\ntruffles.  For my part, I liked a story to begin with an old wayside inn\nwhere, “towards the close of the year 17--,” several gentlemen in\nthree-cocked hats were playing bowls.  A friend of mine preferred the\nMalabar coast in a storm, with a ship beating to windward, and a scowling\nfellow of Herculean proportions striding along the beach; he, to be sure,\nwas a pirate.  This was further afield than my home-keeping fancy loved\nto travel, and designed altogether for a larger canvas than the tales\nthat I affected.  Give me a highwayman and I was full to the brim; a\nJacobite would do, but the highwayman was my favourite dish.  I can still\nhear that merry clatter of the hoofs along the moonlit lane; night and\nthe coming of day are still related in my mind with the doings of John\nRann or Jerry Abershaw; and the words “post-chaise,” the “great North\nroad,” “ostler,” and “nag” still sound in my ears like poetry.  One and\nall, at least, and each with his particular fancy, we read story-books in\nchildhood, not for eloquence or character or thought, but for some\nquality of the brute incident.  That quality was not mere bloodshed or\nwonder.  Although each of these was welcome in its place, the charm for\nthe sake of which we read depended on something different from either.\nMy elders used to read novels aloud; and I can still remember four\ndifferent passages which I heard, before I was ten, with the same keen\nand lasting pleasure.  One I discovered long afterwards to be the\nadmirable opening of _What will he Do with It_: it was no wonder I was\npleased with that.  The other three still remain unidentified.  One is a\nlittle vague; it was about a dark, tall house at night, and people\ngroping on the stairs by the light that escaped from the open door of a\nsickroom.  In another, a lover left a ball, and went walking in a cool,\ndewy park, whence he could watch the lighted windows and the figures of\nthe dancers as they moved.  This was the most sentimental impression I\nthink I had yet received, for a child is somewhat deaf to the\nsentimental.  In the last, a poet, who had been tragically wrangling with\nhis wife, walked forth on the sea-beach on a tempestuous night and\nwitnessed the horrors of a wreck. {153}  Different as they are, all these\nearly favourites have a common note—they have all a touch of the\nromantic.\n\nDrama is the poetry of conduct, romance the poetry of circumstance.  The\npleasure that we take in life is of two sorts—the active and the passive.\nNow we are conscious of a great command over our destiny; anon we are\nlifted up by circumstance, as by a breaking wave, and dashed we know not\nhow into the future.  Now we are pleased by our conduct, anon merely\npleased by our surroundings.  It would be hard to say which of these\nmodes of satisfaction is the more effective, but the latter is surely the\nmore constant.  Conduct is three parts of life, they say; but I think\nthey put it high.  There is a vast deal in life and letters both which is\nnot immoral, but simply a-moral; which either does not regard the human\nwill at all, or deals with it in obvious and healthy relations; where the\ninterest turns, not upon what a man shall choose to do, but on how he\nmanages to do it; not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the\nconscience, but on the problems of the body and of the practical\nintelligence, in clean, open-air adventure, the shock of arms or the\ndiplomacy of life.  With such material as this it is impossible to build\na play, for the serious theatre exists solely on moral grounds, and is a\nstanding proof of the dissemination of the human conscience.  But it is\npossible to build, upon this ground, the most joyous of verses, and the\nmost lively, beautiful, and buoyant tales.\n\nOne thing in life calls for another; there is a fitness in events and\nplaces.  The sight of a pleasant arbour puts it in our mind to sit there.\nOne place suggests work, another idleness, a third early rising and long\nrambles in the dew.  The effect of night, of any flowing water, of\nlighted cities, of the peep of day, of ships, of the open ocean, calls up\nin the mind an army of anonymous desires and pleasures.  Something, we\nfeel, should happen; we know not what, yet we proceed in quest of it.\nAnd many of the happiest hours of life fleet by us in this vain\nattendance on the genius of the place and moment.  It is thus that tracts\nof young fir, and low rocks that reach into deep soundings, particularly\ntorture and delight me.  Something must have happened in such places, and\nperhaps ages back, to members of my race; and when I was a child I tried\nin vain to invent appropriate games for them, as I still try, just as\nvainly, to fit them with the proper story.  Some places speak distinctly.\nCertain dank gardens cry aloud for a murder; certain old houses demand to\nbe haunted; certain coasts are set apart for shipwreck.  Other spots\nagain seem to abide their destiny, suggestive and impenetrable, “miching\nmallecho.”  The inn at Burford Bridge, with its arbours and green garden\nand silent, eddying river—though it is known already as the place where\nKeats wrote some of his _Endymion_ and Nelson parted from his Emma—still\nseems to wait the coming of the appropriate legend.  Within these ivied\nwalls, behind these old green shutters, some further business smoulders,\nwaiting for its hour.  The old Hawes Inn at the Queen’s Ferry makes a\nsimilar call upon my fancy.  There it stands, apart from the town, beside\nthe pier, in a climate of its own, half inland, half marine—in front, the\nferry bubbling with the tide and the guardship swinging to her anchor;\nbehind, the old garden with the trees.  Americans seek it already for the\nsake of Lovel and Oldbuck, who dined there at the beginning of the\n_Antiquary_.  But you need not tell me—that is not all; there is some\nstory, unrecorded or not yet complete, which must express the meaning of\nthat inn more fully.  So it is with names and faces; so it is with\nincidents that are idle and inconclusive in themselves, and yet seem like\nthe beginning of some quaint romance, which the all-careless author\nleaves untold.  How many of these romances have we not seen determine at\ntheir birth; how many people have met us with a look of meaning in their\neye, and sunk at once into trivial acquaintances; to how many places have\nwe not drawn near, with express intimations—“here my destiny awaits\nme”—and we have but dined there and passed on!  I have lived both at the\nHawes and Burford in a perpetual flutter, on the heels, as it seemed, of\nsome adventure that should justify the place; but though the feeling had\nme to bed at night and called me again at morning in one unbroken round\nof pleasure and suspense, nothing befell me in either worth remark.  The\nman or the hour had not yet come; but some day, I think, a boat shall put\noff from the Queen’s Ferry, fraught with a dear cargo, and some frosty\nnight a horseman, on a tragic errand, rattle with his whip upon the green\nshutters of the inn at Burford. {155}\n\nNow, this is one of the natural appetites with which any lively\nliterature has to count.  The desire for knowledge, I had almost added\nthe desire for meat, is not more deeply seated than this demand for fit\nand striking incident.  The dullest of clowns tells, or tries to tell,\nhimself a story, as the feeblest of children uses invention in his play;\nand even as the imaginative grown person, joining in the game, at once\nenriches it with many delightful circumstances, the great creative writer\nshows us the realisation and the apotheosis of the day-dreams of common\nmen.  His stories may be nourished with the realities of life, but their\ntrue mark is to satisfy the nameless longings of the reader, and to obey\nthe ideal laws of the day-dream.  The right kind of thing should fall out\nin the right kind of place; the right kind of thing should follow; and\nnot only the characters talk aptly and think naturally, but all the\ncircumstances in a tale answer one to another like notes in music.  The\nthreads of a story come from time to time together and make a picture in\nthe web; the characters fall from time to time into some attitude to each\nother or to nature, which stamps the story home like an illustration.\nCrusoe recoiling from the footprint, Achilles shouting over against the\nTrojans, Ulysses bending the great bow, Christian running with his\nfingers in his ears, these are each culminating moments in the legend,\nand each has been printed on the mind’s eye for ever.  Other things we\nmay forget; we may forget the words, although they are beautiful; we may\nforget the author’s comment, although perhaps it was ingenious and true;\nbut these epoch-making scenes, which put the last mark of truth upon a\nstory and fill up, at one blow, our capacity for sympathetic pleasure, we\nso adopt into the very bosom of our mind that neither time nor tide can\nefface or weaken the impression.  This, then, is the plastic part of\nliterature: to embody character, thought, or emotion in some act or\nattitude that shall be remarkably striking to the mind’s eye.  This is\nthe highest and hardest thing to do in words; the thing which, once\naccomplished, equally delights the schoolboy and the sage, and makes, in\nits own right, the quality of epics.  Compared with this, all other\npurposes in literature, except the purely lyrical or the purely\nphilosophic, are bastard in nature, facile of execution, and feeble in\nresult.  It is one thing to write about the inn at Burford, or to\ndescribe scenery with the word-painters; it is quite another to seize on\nthe heart of the suggestion and make a country famous with a legend.  It\nis one thing to remark and to dissect, with the most cutting logic, the\ncomplications of life, and of the human spirit; it is quite another to\ngive them body and blood in the story of Ajax or of Hamlet.  The first is\nliterature, but the second is something besides, for it is likewise art.\n\nEnglish people of the present day {157} are apt, I know not why, to look\nsomewhat down on incident, and reserve their admiration for the clink of\nteaspoons and the accents of the curate.  It is thought clever to write a\nnovel with no story at all, or at least with a very dull one.  Reduced\neven to the lowest terms, a certain interest can be communicated by the\nart of narrative; a sense of human kinship stirred; and a kind of\nmonotonous fitness, comparable to the words and air of _Sandy’s Mull_,\npreserved among the infinitesimal occurrences recorded.  Some people\nwork, in this manner, with even a strong touch.  Mr. Trollope’s\ninimitable clergymen naturally arise to the mind in this connection.  But\neven Mr. Trollope does not confine himself to chronicling small beer.\nMr. Crawley’s collision with the Bishop’s wife, Mr. Melnotte dallying in\nthe deserted banquet-room, are typical incidents, epically conceived,\nfitly embodying a crisis.  Or again look at Thackeray.  If Rawdon\nCrawley’s blow were not delivered, _Vanity Fair_ would cease to be a work\nof art.  That scene is the chief ganglion of the tale; and the discharge\nof energy from Rawdon’s fist is the reward and consolation of the reader.\nThe end of _Esmond_ is a yet wider excursion from the author’s customary\nfields; the scene at Castlewood is pure Dumas; the great and wily English\nborrower has here borrowed from the great, unblushing French thief; as\nusual, he has borrowed admirably well, and the breaking of the sword\nrounds off the best of all his books with a manly, martial note.  But\nperhaps nothing can more strongly illustrate the necessity for marking\nincident than to compare the living fame of _Robinson Crusoe_ with the\ndiscredit of _Clarissa Harlowe_.  _Clarissa_ is a book of a far more\nstartling import, worked out, on a great canvas, with inimitable courage\nand unflagging art.  It contains wit, character, passion, plot,\nconversations full of spirit and insight, letters sparkling with\nunstrained humanity; and if the death of the heroine be somewhat frigid\nand artificial, the last days of the hero strike the only note of what we\nnow call Byronism, between the Elizabethans and Byron himself.  And yet a\nlittle story of a shipwrecked sailor, with not a tenth part of the style\nnor a thousandth part of the wisdom, exploring none of the arcana of\nhumanity and deprived of the perennial interest of love, goes on from\nedition to edition, ever young, while _Clarissa_ lies upon the shelves\nunread.  A friend of mine, a Welsh blacksmith, was twenty-five years old\nand could neither read nor write, when he heard a chapter of _Robinson_\nread aloud in a farm kitchen.  Up to that moment he had sat content,\nhuddled in his ignorance, but he left that farm another man.  There were\nday-dreams, it appeared, divine day-dreams, written and printed and\nbound, and to be bought for money and enjoyed at pleasure.  Down he sat\nthat day, painfully learned to read Welsh, and returned to borrow the\nbook.  It had been lost, nor could he find another copy but one that was\nin English.  Down he sat once more, learned English, and at length, and\nwith entire delight, read _Robinson_.  It is like the story of a\nlove-chase.  If he had heard a letter from _Clarissa_, would he have been\nfired with the same chivalrous ardour?  I wonder.  Yet _Clarissa_ has\nevery quality that can be shown in prose, one alone excepted—pictorial or\npicture-making romance.  While _Robinson_ depends, for the most part and\nwith the overwhelming majority of its readers, on the charm of\ncircumstance.\n\nIn the highest achievements of the art of words, the dramatic and the\npictorial, the moral and romantic interest, rise and fall together by a\ncommon and organic law.  Situation is animated with passion, passion\nclothed upon with situation.  Neither exists for itself, but each inheres\nindissolubly with the other.  This is high art; and not only the highest\nart possible in words, but the highest art of all, since it combines the\ngreatest mass and diversity of the elements of truth and pleasure.  Such\nare epics, and the few prose tales that have the epic weight.  But as\nfrom a school of works, aping the creative, incident and romance are\nruthlessly discarded, so may character and drama be omitted or\nsubordinated to romance.  There is one book, for example, more generally\nloved than Shakespeare, that captivates in childhood, and still delights\nin age—I mean the _Arabian Nights_—where you shall look in vain for moral\nor for intellectual interest.  No human face or voice greets us among\nthat wooden crowd of kings and genies, sorcerers and beggarmen.\nAdventure, on the most naked terms, furnishes forth the entertainment and\nis found enough.  Dumas approaches perhaps nearest of any modern to these\nArabian authors in the purely material charm of some of his romances.\nThe early part of _Monte Cristo_, down to the finding of the treasure, is\na piece of perfect story-telling; the man never breathed who shared these\nmoving incidents without a tremor; and yet Faria is a thing of packthread\nand Dantès little more than a name.  The sequel is one long-drawn error,\ngloomy, bloody, unnatural and dull; but as for these early chapters, I do\nnot believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same\nunmingled atmosphere of romance.  It is very thin and light to be sure,\nas on a high mountain; but it is brisk and clear and sunny in proportion.\nI saw the other day, with envy, an old and a very clever lady setting\nforth on a second or third voyage into _Monte Cristo_.  Here are stories\nwhich powerfully affect the reader, which can be reperused at any age,\nand where the characters are no more than puppets.  The bony fist of the\nshowman visibly propels them; their springs are an open secret; their\nfaces are of wood, their bellies filled with bran; and yet we thrillingly\npartake of their adventures.  And the point may be illustrated still\nfurther.  The last interview between Lucy and Richard Feveril is pure\ndrama; more than that, it is the strongest scene, since Shakespeare, in\nthe English tongue.  Their first meeting by the river, on the other hand,\nis pure romance; it has nothing to do with character; it might happen to\nany other boy or maiden, and be none the less delightful for the change.\nAnd yet I think he would be a bold man who should choose between these\npassages.  Thus, in the same book, we may have two scenes, each capital\nin its order: in the one, human passion, deep calling unto deep, shall\nutter its genuine voice; in the second, according circumstances, like\ninstruments in tune, shall build up a trivial but desirable incident,\nsuch as we love to prefigure for ourselves; and in the end, in spite of\nthe critics, we may hesitate to give the preference to either.  The one\nmay ask more genius—I do not say it does; but at least the other dwells\nas clearly in the memory.\n\nTrue romantic art, again, makes a romance of all things.  It reaches into\nthe highest abstraction of the ideal; it does not refuse the most\npedestrian realism.  _Robinson Crusoe_ is as realistic as it is romantic;\nboth qualities are pushed to an extreme, and neither suffers.  Nor does\nromance depend upon the material importance of the incidents.  To deal\nwith strong and deadly elements, banditti, pirates, war and murder, is to\nconjure with great names, and, in the event of failure, to double the\ndisgrace.  The arrival of Haydn and Consuelo at the Canon’s villa is a\nvery trifling incident; yet we may read a dozen boisterous stories from\nbeginning to end, and not receive so fresh and stirring an impression of\nadventure.  It was the scene of Crusoe at the wreck, if I remember\nrightly, that so bewitched my blacksmith.  Nor is the fact surprising.\nEvery single article the castaway recovers from the hulk is “a joy for\never” to the man who reads of them.  They are the things that should be\nfound, and the bare enumeration stirs the blood.  I found a glimmer of\nthe same interest the other day in a new book, _The Sailor’s Sweetheart_,\nby Mr. Clark Russell.  The whole business of the brig _Morning Star_ is\nvery rightly felt and spiritedly written; but the clothes, the books and\nthe money satisfy the reader’s mind like things to eat.  We are dealing\nhere with the old cut-and-dry, legitimate interest of treasure trove.\nBut even treasure trove can be made dull.  There are few people who have\nnot groaned under the plethora of goods that fell to the lot of the\n_Swiss Family Robinson_, that dreary family.  They found article after\narticle, creature after creature, from milk kine to pieces of ordnance, a\nwhole consignment; but no informing taste had presided over the\nselection, there was no smack or relish in the invoice; and these riches\nleft the fancy cold.  The box of goods in Verne’s _Mysterious Island_ is\nanother case in point: there was no gusto and no glamour about that; it\nmight have come from a shop.  But the two hundred and seventy-eight\nAustralian sovereigns on board the _Morning Star_ fell upon me like a\nsurprise that I had expected; whole vistas of secondary stories, besides\nthe one in hand, radiated forth from that discovery, as they radiate from\na striking particular in life; and I was made for the moment as happy as\na reader has the right to be.\n\nTo come at all at the nature of this quality of romance, we must bear in\nmind the peculiarity of our attitude to any art.  No art produces\nillusion; in the theatre we never forget that we are in the theatre; and\nwhile we read a story, we sit wavering between two minds, now merely\nclapping our hands at the merit of the performance, now condescending to\ntake an active part in fancy with the characters.  This last is the\ntriumph of romantic story-telling: when the reader consciously plays at\nbeing the hero, the scene is a good scene.  Now in character-studies the\npleasure that we take is critical; we watch, we approve, we smile at\nincongruities, we are moved to sudden heats of sympathy with courage,\nsuffering or virtue.  But the characters are still themselves, they are\nnot us; the more clearly they are depicted, the more widely do they stand\naway from us, the more imperiously do they thrust us back into our place\nas a spectator.  I cannot identify myself with Rawdon Crawley or with\nEugène de Rastignac, for I have scarce a hope or fear in common with\nthem.  It is not character but incident that woos us out of our reserve.\nSomething happens as we desire to have it happen to ourselves; some\nsituation, that we have long dallied with in fancy, is realised in the\nstory with enticing and appropriate details.  Then we forget the\ncharacters; then we push the hero aside; then we plunge into the tale in\nour own person and bathe in fresh experience; and then, and then only, do\nwe say we have been reading a romance.  It is not only pleasurable things\nthat we imagine in our day-dreams; there are lights in which we are\nwilling to contemplate even the idea of our own death; ways in which it\nseems as if it would amuse us to be cheated, wounded or calumniated.  It\nis thus possible to construct a story, even of tragic import, in which\nevery incident, detail and trick of circumstance shall be welcome to the\nreader’s thoughts.  Fiction is to the grown man what play is to the\nchild; it is there that he changes the atmosphere and tenor of his life;\nand when the game so chimes with his fancy that he can join in it with\nall his heart, when it pleases him with every turn, when he loves to\nrecall it and dwells upon its recollection with entire delight, fiction\nis called romance.\n\nWalter Scott is out and away the king of the romantics.  _The Lady of the\nLake_ has no indisputable claim to be a poem beyond the inherent fitness\nand desirability of the tale.  It is just such a story as a man would\nmake up for himself, walking, in the best health and temper, through just\nsuch scenes as it is laid in.  Hence it is that a charm dwells\nundefinable among these slovenly verses, as the unseen cuckoo fills the\nmountains with his note; hence, even after we have flung the book aside,\nthe scenery and adventures remain present to the mind, a new and green\npossession, not unworthy of that beautiful name, _The Lady of the Lake_,\nor that direct, romantic opening—one of the most spirited and poetical in\nliterature—“The stag at eve had drunk his fill.”  The same strength and\nthe same weaknesses adorn and disfigure the novels.  In that ill-written,\nragged book, _The Pirate_, the figure of Cleveland—cast up by the sea on\nthe resounding foreland of Dunrossness—moving, with the blood on his\nhands and the Spanish words on his tongue, among the simple\nislanders—singing a serenade under the window of his Shetland mistress—is\nconceived in the very highest manner of romantic invention.  The words of\nhis song, “Through groves of palm,” sung in such a scene and by such a\nlover, clench, as in a nutshell, the emphatic contrast upon which the\ntale is built.  In _Guy Mannering_, again, every incident is delightful\nto the imagination; and the scene when Harry Bertram lands at Ellangowan\nis a model instance of romantic method.\n\n“‘I remember the tune well,’ he says, ‘though I cannot guess what should\nat present so strongly recall it to my memory.”  He took his flageolet\nfrom his pocket and played a simple melody.  Apparently the tune awoke\nthe corresponding associations of a damsel.  She immediately took up the\nsong—\n\n    “‘Are these the links of Forth, she said;\n       Or are they the crooks of Dee,\n    Or the bonny woods of Warroch Head\n       That I so fain would see?’\n\n“‘By heaven!’ said Bertram, ‘it is the very ballad.’”\n\nOn this quotation two remarks fall to be made.  First, as an instance of\nmodern feeling for romance, this famous touch of the flageolet and the\nold song is selected by Miss Braddon for omission.  Miss Braddon’s idea\nof a story, like Mrs. Todgers’s idea of a wooden leg, were something\nstrange to have expounded.  As a matter of personal experience, Meg’s\nappearance to old Mr. Bertram on the road, the ruins of Derncleugh, the\nscene of the flageolet, and the Dominie’s recognition of Harry, are the\nfour strong notes that continue to ring in the mind after the book is\nlaid aside.  The second point is still more curious.  The reader will\nobserve a mark of excision in the passage as quoted by me.  Well, here is\nhow it runs in the original: “a damsel, who, close behind a fine spring\nabout half-way down the descent, and which had once supplied the castle\nwith water, was engaged in bleaching linen.”  A man who gave in such copy\nwould be discharged from the staff of a daily paper.  Scott has forgotten\nto prepare the reader for the presence of the “damsel”; he has forgotten\nto mention the spring and its relation to the ruin; and now, face to face\nwith his omission, instead of trying back and starting fair, crams all\nthis matter, tail foremost, into a single shambling sentence.  It is not\nmerely bad English, or bad style; it is abominably bad narrative besides.\n\nCertainly the contrast is remarkable; and it is one that throws a strong\nlight upon the subject of this paper.  For here we have a man of the\nfinest creative instinct touching with perfect certainty and charm the\nromantic junctures of his story; and we find him utterly careless,\nalmost, it would seem, incapable, in the technical matter of style, and\nnot only frequently weak, but frequently wrong in points of drama.  In\ncharacter parts, indeed, and particularly in the Scotch, he was delicate,\nstrong and truthful; but the trite, obliterated features of too many of\nhis heroes have already wearied two generations of readers.  At times his\ncharacters will speak with something far beyond propriety with a true\nheroic note; but on the next page they will be wading wearily forward\nwith an ungrammatical and undramatic rigmarole of words.  The man who\ncould conceive and write the character of Elspeth of the Craigburnfoot,\nas Scott has conceived and written it, had not only splendid romantic,\nbut splendid tragic gifts.  How comes it, then, that he could so often\nfob us off with languid, inarticulate twaddle?\n\nIt seems to me that the explanation is to be found in the very quality of\nhis surprising merits.  As his books are play to the reader, so were they\nplay to him.  He conjured up the romantic with delight, but he had hardly\npatience to describe it.  He was a great day-dreamer, a seer of fit and\nbeautiful and humorous visions, but hardly a great artist; hardly, in the\nmanful sense, an artist at all.  He pleased himself, and so he pleases\nus.  Of the pleasures of his art he tasted fully; but of its toils and\nvigils and distresses never man knew less.  A great romantic—an idle\nchild.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. A HUMBLE REMONSTRANCE {168a}\n\n\nWe have recently {168b} enjoyed a quite peculiar pleasure: hearing, in\nsome detail, the opinions, about the art they practise, of Mr. Walter\nBesant and Mr. Henry James; two men certainly of very different calibre:\nMr. James so precise of outline, so cunning of fence, so scrupulous of\nfinish, and Mr. Besant so genial, so friendly, with so persuasive and\nhumorous a vein of whim: Mr. James the very type of the deliberate\nartist, Mr. Besant the impersonation of good nature.  That such doctors\nshould differ will excite no great surprise; but one point in which they\nseem to agree fills me, I confess, with wonder.  For they are both\ncontent to talk about the “art of fiction”; and Mr. Besant, waxing\nexceedingly bold, goes on to oppose this so-called “art of fiction” to\nthe “art of poetry.”  By the art of poetry he can mean nothing but the\nart of verse, an art of handicraft, and only comparable with the art of\nprose.  For that heat and height of sane emotion which we agree to call\nby the name of poetry, is but a libertine and vagrant quality; present,\nat times, in any art, more often absent from them all; too seldom present\nin the prose novel, too frequently absent from the ode and epic.  Fiction\nis the same case; it is no substantive art, but an element which enters\nlargely into all the arts but architecture.  Homer, Wordsworth, Phidias,\nHogarth, and Salvini, all deal in fiction; and yet I do not suppose that\neither Hogarth or Salvini, to mention but these two, entered in any\ndegree into the scope of Mr. Besant’s interesting lecture or Mr. James’s\ncharming essay.  The art of fiction, then, regarded as a definition, is\nboth too ample and too scanty.  Let me suggest another; let me suggest\nthat what both Mr. James and Mr. Besant had in view was neither more nor\nless than the art of narrative.\n\nBut Mr. Besant is anxious to speak solely of “the modern English novel,”\nthe stay and bread-winner of Mr. Mudie; and in the author of the most\npleasing novel on that roll, _All Sorts and Conditions of Men_, the\ndesire is natural enough.  I can conceive, then, that he would hasten to\npropose two additions, and read thus: the art of _fictitious_ narrative\n_in prose_.\n\nNow the fact of the existence of the modern English novel is not to be\ndenied; materially, with its three volumes, leaded type, and gilded\nlettering, it is easily distinguishable from other forms of literature;\nbut to talk at all fruitfully of any branch of art, it is needful to\nbuild our definitions on some more fundamental ground then binding.  Why,\nthen, are we to add “in prose”?  _The Odyssey_ appears to me the best of\nromances; _The Lady of the Lake_ to stand high in the second order; and\nChaucer’s tales and prologues to contain more of the matter and art of\nthe modern English novel than the whole treasury of Mr. Mudie.  Whether a\nnarrative be written in blank verse or the Spenserian stanza, in the long\nperiod of Gibbon or the chipped phrase of Charles Reade, the principles\nof the art of narrative must be equally observed.  The choice of a noble\nand swelling style in prose affects the problem of narration in the same\nway, if not to the same degree, as the choice of measured verse; for both\nimply a closer synthesis of events, a higher key of dialogue, and a more\npicked and stately strain of words.  If you are to refuse _Don Juan_, it\nis hard to see why you should include _Zanoni_ or (to bracket works of\nvery different value) _The Scarlet Letter_; and by what discrimination\nare you to open your doors to _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ and close them on\n_The Faery Queen_?  To bring things closer home, I will here propound to\nMr. Besant a conundrum.  A narrative called _Paradise Lost_ was written\nin English verse by one John Milton; what was it then?  It was next\ntranslated by Chateaubriand into French prose; and what was it then?\nLastly, the French translation was, by some inspired compatriot of George\nGilfillan (and of mine) turned bodily into an English novel; and, in the\nname of clearness, what was it then?\n\nBut, once more, why should we add “fictitious”?  The reason why is\nobvious.  The reason why not, if something more recondite, does not want\nfor weight.  The art of narrative, in fact, is the same, whether it is\napplied to the selection and illustration of a real series of events or\nof an imaginary series.  Boswell’s _Life of Johnson_ (a work of cunning\nand inimitable art) owes its success to the same technical manœuvres as\n(let us say) _Tom Jones_: the clear conception of certain characters of\nman, the choice and presentation of certain incidents out of a great\nnumber that offered, and the invention (yes, invention) and preservation\nof a certain key in dialogue.  In which these things are done with the\nmore art—in which with the greater air of nature—readers will differently\njudge.  Boswell’s is, indeed, a very special case, and almost a generic;\nbut it is not only in Boswell, it is in every biography with any salt of\nlife, it is in every history where events and men, rather than ideas, are\npresented—in Tacitus, in Carlyle, in Michelet, in Macaulay—that the\nnovelist will find many of his own methods most conspicuously and\nadroitly handled.  He will find besides that he, who is free—who has the\nright to invent or steal a missing incident, who has the right, more\nprecious still, of wholesale omission—is frequently defeated, and, with\nall his advantages, leaves a less strong impression of reality and\npassion.  Mr. James utters his mind with a becoming fervour on the\nsanctity of truth to the novelist; on a more careful examination truth\nwill seem a word of very debateable propriety, not only for the labours\nof the novelist, but for those of the historian.  No art—to use the\ndaring phrase of Mr. James—can successfully “compete with life”; and the\nart that seeks to do so is condemned to perish _montibus aviis_.  Life\ngoes before us, infinite in complication; attended by the most various\nand surprising meteors; appealing at once to the eye, to the ear, to the\nmind—the seat of wonder, to the touch—so thrillingly delicate, and to the\nbelly—so imperious when starved.  It combines and employs in its\nmanifestation the method and material, not of one art only, but of all\nthe arts, Music is but an arbitrary trifling with a few of life’s\nmajestic chords; painting is but a shadow of its pageantry of light and\ncolour; literature does but drily indicate that wealth of incident, of\nmoral obligation, of virtue, vice, action, rapture and agony, with which\nit teems.  To “compete with life,” whose sun we cannot look upon, whose\npassions and diseases waste and slay us—to compete with the flavour of\nwine, the beauty of the dawn, the scorching of fire, the bitterness of\ndeath and separation—here is, indeed, a projected escalade of heaven;\nhere are, indeed, labours for a Hercules in a dress coat, armed with a\npen and a dictionary to depict the passions, armed with a tube of\nsuperior flake-white to paint the portrait of the insufferable sun.  No\nart is true in this sense: none can “compete with life”: not even\nhistory, built indeed of indisputable facts, but these facts robbed of\ntheir vivacity and sting; so that even when we read of the sack of a city\nor the fall of an empire, we are surprised, and justly commend the\nauthor’s talent, if our pulse be quickened.  And mark, for a last\ndifferentia, that this quickening of the pulse is, in almost every case,\npurely agreeable; that these phantom reproductions of experience, even at\ntheir most acute, convey decided pleasure; while experience itself, in\nthe cockpit of life, can torture and slay.\n\nWhat, then, is the object, what the method, of an art, and what the\nsource of its power?  The whole secret is that no art does “compete with\nlife.”  Man’s one method, whether he reasons or creates, is to half-shut\nhis eyes against the dazzle and confusion of reality.  The arts, like\narithmetic and geometry, turn away their eyes from the gross, coloured\nand mobile nature at our feet, and regard instead a certain figmentary\nabstraction.  Geometry will tell us of a circle, a thing never seen in\nnature; asked about a green circle or an iron circle, it lays its hand\nupon its mouth.  So with the arts.  Painting, ruefully comparing sunshine\nand flake-white, gives up truth of colour, as it had already given up\nrelief and movement; and instead of vying with nature, arranges a scheme\nof harmonious tints.  Literature, above all in its most typical mood, the\nmood of narrative, similarly flees the direct challenge and pursues\ninstead an independent and creative aim.  So far as it imitates at all,\nit imitates not life but speech: not the facts of human destiny, but the\nemphasis and the suppressions with which the human actor tells of them.\nThe real art that dealt with life directly was that of the first men who\ntold their stories round the savage camp-fire.  Our art is occupied, and\nbound to be occupied, not so much in making stories true as in making\nthem typical; not so much in capturing the lineaments of each fact, as in\nmarshalling all of them towards a common end.  For the welter of\nimpressions, all forcible but all discreet, which life presents, it\nsubstitutes a certain artificial series of impressions, all indeed most\nfeebly represented, but all aiming at the same effect, all eloquent of\nthe same idea, all chiming together like consonant notes in music or like\nthe graduated tints in a good picture.  From all its chapters, from all\nits pages, from all its sentences, the well-written novel echoes and\nre-echoes its one creative and controlling thought; to this must every\nincident and character contribute; the style must have been pitched in\nunison with this; and if there is anywhere a word that looks another way,\nthe book would be stronger, clearer, and (I had almost said) fuller\nwithout it.  Life is monstrous, infinite, illogical, abrupt and poignant;\na work of art, in comparison, is neat, finite, self-contained, rational,\nflowing and emasculate.  Life imposes by brute energy, like inarticulate\nthunder; art catches the ear, among the far louder noises of experience,\nlike an air artificially made by a discreet musician.  A proposition of\ngeometry does not compete with life; and a proposition of geometry is a\nfair and luminous parallel for a work of art.  Both are reasonable, both\nuntrue to the crude fact; both inhere in nature, neither represents it.\nThe novel, which is a work of art, exists, not by its resemblances to\nlife, which are forced and material, as a shoe must still consist of\nleather, but by its immeasurable difference from life, which is designed\nand significant, and is both the method and the meaning of the work.\n\nThe life of man is not the subject of novels, but the inexhaustible\nmagazine from which subjects are to be selected; the name of these is\nlegion; and with each new subject—for here again I must differ by the\nwhole width of heaven from Mr. James—the true artist will vary his method\nand change the point of attack.  That which was in one case an\nexcellence, will become a defect in another; what was the making of one\nbook, will in the next be impertinent or dull.  First each novel, and\nthen each class of novels, exists by and for itself.  I will take, for\ninstance, three main classes, which are fairly distinct: first, the novel\nof adventure, which appeals to certain almost sensual and quite illogical\ntendencies in man; second, the novel of character, which appeals to our\nintellectual appreciation of man’s foibles and mingled and inconstant\nmotives; and third, the dramatic novel, which deals with the same stuff\nas the serious theatre, and appeals to our emotional nature and moral\njudgment.\n\nAnd first for the novel of adventure.  Mr. James refers, with singular\ngenerosity of praise, to a little book about a quest for hidden treasure;\nbut he lets fall, by the way, some rather startling words.  In this book\nhe misses what he calls the “immense luxury” of being able to quarrel\nwith his author.  The luxury, to most of us, is to lay by our judgment,\nto be submerged by the tale as by a billow, and only to awake, and begin\nto distinguish and find fault, when the piece is over and the volume laid\naside.  Still more remarkable is Mr. James’s reason.  He cannot criticise\nthe author, as he goes, “because,” says he, comparing it with another\nwork, “_I have been a child_, _but I have never been on a quest for\nburied treasure_.”  Here is, indeed, a wilful paradox; for if he has\nnever been on a quest for buried treasure, it can be demonstrated that he\nhas never been a child.  There never was a child (unless Master James)\nbut has hunted gold, and been a pirate, and a military commander, and a\nbandit of the mountains; but has fought, and suffered shipwreck and\nprison, and imbrued its little hands in gore, and gallantly retrieved the\nlost battle, and triumphantly protected innocence and beauty.  Elsewhere\nin his essay Mr. James has protested with excellent reason against too\nnarrow a conception of experience; for the born artist, he contends, the\n“faintest hints of life” are converted into revelations; and it will be\nfound true, I believe, in a majority of cases, that the artist writes\nwith more gusto and effect of those things which he has only wished to\ndo, than of those which he has done.  Desire is a wonderful telescope,\nand Pisgah the best observatory.  Now, while it is true that neither Mr.\nJames nor the author of the work in question has ever, in the fleshly\nsense, gone questing after gold, it is probable that both have ardently\ndesired and fondly imagined the details of such a life in youthful\nday-dreams; and the author, counting upon that, and well aware (cunning\nand low-minded man!) that this class of interest, having been frequently\ntreated, finds a readily accessible and beaten road to the sympathies of\nthe reader, addressed himself throughout to the building up and\ncircumstantiation of this boyish dream.  Character to the boy is a sealed\nbook; for him, a pirate is a beard, a pair of wide trousers and a liberal\ncomplement of pistols.  The author, for the sake of circumstantiation and\nbecause he was himself more or less grown up, admitted character, within\ncertain limits, into his design; but only within certain limits.  Had the\nsame puppets figured in a scheme of another sort, they had been drawn to\nvery different purpose; for in this elementary novel of adventure, the\ncharacters need to be presented with but one class of qualities—the\nwarlike and formidable.  So as they appear insidious in deceit and fatal\nin the combat, they have served their end.  Danger is the matter with\nwhich this class of novel deals; fear, the passion with which it idly\ntrifles; and the characters are portrayed only so far as they realise the\nsense of danger and provoke the sympathy of fear.  To add more traits, to\nbe too clever, to start the hare of moral or intellectual interest while\nwe are running the fox of material interest, is not to enrich but to\nstultify your tale.  The stupid reader will only be offended, and the\nclever reader lose the scent.\n\nThe novel of character has this difference from all others: that it\nrequires no coherency of plot, and for this reason, as in the case of\n_Gil Blas_, it is sometimes called the novel of adventure.  It turns on\nthe humours of the persons represented; these are, to be sure, embodied\nin incidents, but the incidents themselves, being tributary, need not\nmarch in a progression; and the characters may be statically shown.  As\nthey enter, so they may go out; they must be consistent, but they need\nnot grow.  Here Mr. James will recognise the note of much of his own\nwork: he treats, for the most part, the statics of character, studying it\nat rest or only gently moved; and, with his usual delicate and just\nartistic instinct, he avoids those stronger passions which would deform\nthe attitudes he loves to study, and change his sitters from the\nhumorists of ordinary life to the brute forces and bare types of more\nemotional moments.  In his recent _Author of Beltraffio_, so just in\nconception, so nimble and neat in workmanship, strong passion is indeed\nemployed; but observe that it is not displayed.  Even in the heroine the\nworking of the passion is suppressed; and the great struggle, the true\ntragedy, the _scène-à-faire_ passes unseen behind the panels of a locked\ndoor.  The delectable invention of the young visitor is introduced,\nconsciously or not, to this end: that Mr. James, true to his method,\nmight avoid the scene of passion.  I trust no reader will suppose me\nguilty of undervaluing this little masterpiece.  I mean merely that it\nbelongs to one marked class of novel, and that it would have been very\ndifferently conceived and treated had it belonged to that other marked\nclass, of which I now proceed to speak.\n\nI take pleasure in calling the dramatic novel by that name, because it\nenables me to point out by the way a strange and peculiarly English\nmisconception.  It is sometimes supposed that the drama consists of\nincident.  It consists of passion, which gives the actor his opportunity;\nand that passion must progressively increase, or the actor, as the piece\nproceeded, would be unable to carry the audience from a lower to a higher\npitch of interest and emotion.  A good serious play must therefore be\nfounded on one of the passionate _cruces_ of life, where duty and\ninclination come nobly to the grapple; and the same is true of what I\ncall, for that reason, the dramatic novel.  I will instance a few worthy\nspecimens, all of our own day and language; Meredith’s _Rhoda Fleming_,\nthat wonderful and painful book, long out of print, {178} and hunted for\nat bookstalls like an Aldine; Hardy’s _Pair of Blue Eyes_; and two of\nCharles Reade’s, _Griffith Gaunt_ and the _Double Marriage_, originally\ncalled _White Lies_, and founded (by an accident quaintly favourable to\nmy nomenclature) on a play by Maquet, the partner of the great Dumas.  In\nthis kind of novel the closed door of _The Author of Beltraffio_ must be\nbroken open; passion must appear upon the scene and utter its last word;\npassion is the be-all and the end-all, the plot and the solution, the\nprotagonist and the _deus ex machinâ_ in one.  The characters may come\nanyhow upon the stage: we do not care; the point is, that, before they\nleave it, they shall become transfigured and raised out of themselves by\npassion.  It may be part of the design to draw them with detail; to\ndepict a full-length character, and then behold it melt and change in the\nfurnace of emotion.  But there is no obligation of the sort; nice\nportraiture is not required; and we are content to accept mere abstract\ntypes, so they be strongly and sincerely moved.  A novel of this class\nmay be even great, and yet contain no individual figure; it may be great,\nbecause it displays the workings of the perturbed heart and the\nimpersonal utterance of passion; and with an artist of the second class\nit is, indeed, even more likely to be great, when the issue has thus been\nnarrowed and the whole force of the writer’s mind directed to passion\nalone.  Cleverness again, which has its fair field in the novel of\ncharacter, is debarred all entry upon this more solemn theatre.  A\nfar-fetched motive, an ingenious evasion of the issue, a witty instead of\na passionate turn, offend us like an insincerity.  All should be plain,\nall straightforward to the end.  Hence it is that, in _Rhoda Fleming_,\nMrs. Lovell raises such resentment in the reader; her motives are too\nflimsy, her ways are too equivocal, for the weight and strength of her\nsurroundings.  Hence the hot indignation of the reader when Balzac, after\nhaving begun the _Duchesse de Langeais_ in terms of strong if somewhat\nswollen passion, cuts the knot by the derangement of the hero’s clock.\nSuch personages and incidents belong to the novel of character; they are\nout of place in the high society of the passions; when the passions are\nintroduced in art at their full height, we look to see them, not baffled\nand impotently striving, as in life, but towering above circumstance and\nacting substitutes for fate.\n\nAnd here I can imagine Mr. James, with his lucid sense, to intervene.  To\nmuch of what I have said he would apparently demur; in much he would,\nsomewhat impatiently, acquiesce.  It may be true; but it is not what he\ndesired to say or to hear said.  He spoke of the finished picture and its\nworth when done; I, of the brushes, the palette, and the north light.  He\nuttered his views in the tone and for the ear of good society; I, with\nthe emphasis and technicalities of the obtrusive student.  But the point,\nI may reply, is not merely to amuse the public, but to offer helpful\nadvice to the young writer.  And the young writer will not so much be\nhelped by genial pictures of what an art may aspire to at its highest, as\nby a true idea of what it must be on the lowest terms.  The best that we\ncan say to him is this: Let him choose a motive, whether of character or\npassion; carefully construct his plot so that every incident is an\nillustration of the motive, and every property employed shall bear to it\na near relation of congruity or contrast; avoid a sub-plot, unless, as\nsometimes in Shakespeare, the sub-plot be a reversion or complement of\nthe main intrigue; suffer not his style to flag below the level of the\nargument; pitch the key of conversation, not with any thought of how men\ntalk in parlours, but with a single eye to the degree of passion he may\nbe called on to express; and allow neither himself in the narrative nor\nany character in the course of the dialogue, to utter one sentence that\nis not part and parcel of the business of the story or the discussion of\nthe problem involved.  Let him not regret if this shortens his book; it\nwill be better so; for to add irrelevant matter is not to lengthen but to\nbury.  Let him not mind if he miss a thousand qualities, so that he keeps\nunflaggingly in pursuit of the one he has chosen.  Let him not care\nparticularly if he miss the tone of conversation, the pungent material\ndetail of the day’s manners, the reproduction of the atmosphere and the\nenvironment.  These elements are not essential: a novel may be excellent,\nand yet have none of them; a passion or a character is so much the better\ndepicted as it rises clearer from material circumstance.  In this age of\nthe particular, let him remember the ages of the abstract, the great\nbooks of the past, the brave men that lived before Shakespeare and before\nBalzac.  And as the root of the whole matter, let him bear in mind that\nhis novel is not a transcript of life, to be judged by its exactitude;\nbut a simplification of some side or point of life, to stand or fall by\nits significant simplicity.  For although, in great men, working upon\ngreat motives, what we observe and admire is often their complexity, yet\nunderneath appearances the truth remains unchanged: that simplification\nwas their method, and that simplicity is their excellence.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSince the above was written another novelist has entered repeatedly the\nlists of theory: one well worthy of mention, Mr. W. D. Howells; and none\never couched a lance with narrower convictions.  His own work and those\nof his pupils and masters singly occupy his mind; he is the bondslave,\nthe zealot of his school; he dreams of an advance in art like what there\nis in science; he thinks of past things as radically dead; he thinks a\nform can be outlived: a strange immersion in his own history; a strange\nforgetfulness of the history of the race!  Meanwhile, by a glance at his\nown works (could he see them with the eager eyes of his readers) much of\nthis illusion would be dispelled.  For while he holds all the poor little\northodoxies of the day—no poorer and no smaller than those of yesterday\nor to-morrow, poor and small, indeed, only so far as they are\nexclusive—the living quality of much that he has done is of a contrary, I\nhad almost said of a heretical, complexion.  A man, as I read him, of an\noriginally strong romantic bent—a certain glow of romance still resides\nin many of his books, and lends them their distinction.  As by accident\nhe runs out and revels in the exceptional; and it is then, as often as\nnot, that his reader rejoices—justly, as I contend.  For in all this\nexcessive eagerness to be centrally human, is there not one central human\nthing that Mr. Howells is too often tempted to neglect: I mean himself?\nA poet, a finished artist, a man in love with the appearances of life, a\ncunning reader of the mind, he has other passions and aspirations than\nthose he loves to draw.  And why should he suppress himself and do such\nreverence to the Lemuel Barkers?  The obvious is not of necessity the\nnormal; fashion rules and deforms; the majority fall tamely into the\ncontemporary shape, and thus attain, in the eyes of the true observer,\nonly a higher power of insignificance; and the danger is lest, in seeking\nto draw the normal, a man should draw the null, and write the novel of\nsociety instead of the romance of man.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                   Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\n                            Edinburgh & London\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n{1}  1881.\n\n{15} Written for the “Book” of the Edinburgh University Union Fancy Fair.\n\n{17}  Professor Tait’s laboratory assistant.\n\n{84}  In Dr. Murray’s admirable new dictionary, I have remarked a flaw\n_sub voce_ Beacon.
