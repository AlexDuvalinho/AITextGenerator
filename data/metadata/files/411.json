 "text": "THE KING'S JACKAL\n\n\nBY\n\nRICHARD HARDING DAVIS\n\n\n\n\nThe King's Jackal\n\n\nI\n\nThe private terrace of the Hotel Grand Bretagne, at Tangier, was shaded\nby a great awning of red and green and yellow, and strewn with colored\nmats, and plants in pots, and wicker chairs.  It reached out from the\nKings apartments into the Garden of Palms, and was hidden by them on\ntwo sides, and showed from the third the blue waters of the\nMediterranean and the great shadow of Gibraltar in the distance.\n\nThe Sultan of Morocco had given orders from Fez that the King of\nMessina, in spite of his incognito, should be treated during his stay\nin Tangier with the consideration due to his rank, so one-half of the\nHotel Grand Bretagne had been set aside for him and his suite, and two\nsoldiers of the Bashaw's Guard sat outside of his door with drawn\nswords.  They were answerable with their heads for the life and safety\nof the Sultan's guest, and as they could speak no language but their\nown, they made a visit to his Majesty more a matter of adventure than\nof etiquette.\n\nNiccolas, the King's majordomo, stepped out upon the terrace and swept\nthe Mediterranean with a field-glass for the third time since sunrise.\nHe lowered it, and turned doubtfully toward the two soldiers.\n\n\"The boat from Gibraltar--has she arrived yet?\" he asked.\n\nThe two ebony figures shook their heads stiffly, as though they\nresented this introduction of a foreign language, and continued to\nshake their heads as the servant addressed the same question to them in\na succession of strange tongues.\n\n\"Well,\" said Colonel Erhaupt, briskly, as he followed Niccolas out upon\nthe terrace, \"has the boat arrived?  And the launch from the yacht,\" he\ncontinued, \"has it started for shore yet?\"\n\nThe man pointed to where the yacht lay, a mile outside the harbor, and\nhanded him the glass.\n\n\"It is but just now leaving the ship's side,\" he said.  \"But I cannot\nmake out who comes in her.  Ah, pardon,\" he added quickly, as he\npointed to a stout elderly gentleman who walked rapidly toward them\nthrough the garden.  \"The Gibraltar boat must be in, sir.  Here is\nBaron Barrat coming up the path.\"\n\nColonel Erhaupt gave an exclamation of satisfaction, and waved his hand\nto the newcomer in welcome.\n\n\"Go tell his Majesty,\" he said to the servant.\n\nThe man hesitated and bowed.  \"His Majesty still sleeps.\"\n\n\"Wake him,\" commanded Erhaupt.  \"Tell him I said to do so.  Well,\nBaron,\" he cried, gayly, as he stepped forward, \"welcome--or are you\nwelcome?\" he added, with an uneasy laugh.\n\n\"I should be.  I have succeeded,\" the other replied gruffly, as he\nbrushed past him.  \"Where is the King?\"\n\n\"He will be here in a moment.  I have sent to wake him.  And you have\nbeen successful?  Good.  I congratulate you.  How far successful?\"\n\nThe Baron threw himself into one of the wicker chairs, and clapped his\nhands impatiently for a servant.  \"Twelve thousand pounds in all,\" he\nreplied.  \"That's more than he expected.  It was like pulling teeth at\nfirst.  I want some coffee at once,\" he said to the attendant, \"and a\nbath.  That boat reeked with Moors and cattle, and there was no\nwagon-lit on the train from Madrid.  I sat up all night, and played\ncards with that young Cellini.  Have Madame Zara and Kalonay returned?\nI see the yacht in the harbor.  Did she succeed?\"\n\n\"We do not know; the boat only arrived at daybreak.  They are probably\non the launch that is coming in now.\"\n\nAs Barrat sipped his coffee and munched his rolls with the silent\nenergy of a hungry man, the Colonel turned and strode up and down the\nterrace, pulling at his mustache and glancing sideways.  When the Baron\nhad lighted a cigarette and thrown himself back in his chair, Erhaupt\nhalted and surveyed him in some anxiety.\n\n\"You have been gone over two weeks,\" he said.  \"I should like to see\nyou accomplish as much in as short a time,\" growled the other.  \"You\nknow Paris.  You know how hard it is to get people to be serious there.\nI had the devil's own time at first.  You got my cablegram?\"\n\n\"Yes; it wasn't encouraging.\"\n\n\"Well, I wasn't hopeful myself.  They wouldn't believe a word of it at\nfirst.  They said Louis hadn't shown such great love for his country or\nhis people since his exile that they could feel any confidence in him,\nand that his conduct in the last six years did not warrant their\njoining any undertaking in which he was concerned.  You can't blame\nthem.  They've backed him so many times already, and they've been\nbitten, and they're shy, naturally.  But I swore he was repentant, that\nhe saw the error of his ways, that he wanted to sit once more before he\ndied on the throne of his ancestors, and that he felt it was due to his\nson that he should make an effort to get him back his birthright.  It\nwas the son won them.  `Exhibit A' I call him.  None of them would hear\nof it until I spoke of the Prince.  So when I saw that, I told them he\nwas a fine little chap, healthy and manly and brave, and devoted to his\npriest, and all that rot, and they began to listen.  At first they\nwanted his Majesty to abdicate, and give the boy a clear road to the\ncrown, but of course I hushed that up.  I told them we were acting\nadvisedly, that we had reason to know that the common people of Messina\nwere sick of the Republic, and wanted their King; that Louis loved the\ncommon people like a father; that he would re-establish the Church in\nall her power, and that Father Paul was working day and night for us,\nand that the Vatican was behind us.  Then I dealt out decorations and a\nfew titles, which Louis has made smell so confoundedly rank to Heaven\nthat nobody would take them.  It was like a game.  I played one noble\ngentleman against another, and gave this one a portrait of the King one\nday, and the other a miniature of `Exhibit A' the next and they grew\njealous, and met together, and talked it over, and finally unlocked\ntheir pockets.  They contributed about L9,000 between them.  Then the\nenthusiasm spread to the women, and they gave me their jewels, and a\nlot of youngsters volunteered for the expedition, and six of them came\non with me in the train last night.  I won two thousand francs from\nthat boy Cellini on the way down.  They're all staying at the\nContinental.  I promised them an audience this morning.\"\n\n\"Good,\" commented the Colonel, \"good--L9,000.  I suppose you took out\nyour commission in advance?\"\n\n\"I took out nothing,\" returned the other, angrily.  \"I brought it all\nwith me, and I have a letter from each of them stating just what he or\nshe subscribed toward the expedition,--the Duke Dantiz, so much; the\nDuke D'Orvay, 50,000 francs; the Countess Mattini, a diamond necklace.\nIt is all quite regular.  I played fair.\"  The Colonel had stopped in\nhis walk, and had been peering eagerly down the leafy path through the\ngarden.  \"Is that not Zara coming now?\" he asked.  \"Look, your eyes are\nbetter than mine.\"\n\nBarrat rose  quickly, and the two men walked forward, and bowed with\nthe easy courtesy of old comrades to a tall, fair girl who came\nhurriedly up the steps.  The Countess Zara was a young woman, but one\nwho had stood so long on guard against the world, that the strain had\ntold, and her eyes were hard and untrustful, so that she looked much\nolder than she really was.  Her life was of two parts.  There was\nlittle to be told of the first part; she was an English girl who had\ncome from a manufacturing town to study art and live alone in Paris,\nwhere she had been too indolent to work, and too brilliant to remain\nlong without companions eager for her society.  Through them and the\nstories of her wit and her beauty, she had come to know the King of\nMessina, and with that meeting the second part of her life began; for\nshe had found something so attractive, either in his title or in the\ncynical humor of the man himself, that for the last two years she had\nfollowed his fortunes, and Miss Muriel Winter, art student, had become\nthe Countess Zara, and an uncrowned queen.  She was beautiful, with\ngreat masses of yellow hair and wonderful brown eyes.  Her manner when\nshe spoke seemed to show that she despised the world and those in it\nalmost as thoroughly as she despised herself.\n\nOn the morning of her return from Messina, she wore a blue serge\nyachting suit with a golf cloak hanging from her shoulders, and as she\ncrossed the terrace she pulled nervously at her gloves and held out her\nhand covered with jewels to each of the two men.\n\n\"I bring good news,\" she said, with an excited laugh.  \"Where is Louis?\"\n\n\"I will tell his Majesty that you have come.  You are most welcome,\"\nthe Baron answered.\n\nBut as he turned to the door it opened from the inside and the king\ncame toward them, shivering and blinking his eyes in the bright\nsunlight.  It showed the wrinkles and creases around his mouth and the\nblue veins under the mottled skin, and the tiny lines at the corners of\nhis little bloodshot eyes that marked the pace at which he had lived as\ntruthfully as the rings on a tree-trunk tell of its quiet growth.\n\nHe caught up his long dressing-gown across his chest as though it were\na mantle, and with a quick glance to see that there were no other\nwitnesses to his deshabille, bent and kissed the woman's hand, and\ntaking it in his own stroked it gently.\n\n\"My dear Marie,\" he lisped, \"it is like heaven to have you back with us\nagain.  We have felt your absence every hour.  Pray be seated, and\npardon my robe.  I saw you through the blinds and could not wait.  Tell\nus the glorious news.  The Baron's good words I have already overheard;\nI listened to them with great entertainment while I was dressing.  I\nhoped he would say something discourteous or foolish, but he was quite\ndiscreet until he told Erhaupt that he had kept back none of the money.\nThen I lost interest.  Fiction is never so entertaining to me as the\ntruth and real people.  But tell us now of your mission and of all you\ndid; and whether successful or not, be assured you are most welcome.\"\n\nThe Countess Zara smiled at him doubtfully and crossed her hands in her\nlap, glancing anxiously over her shoulder.\n\n\"I must be very brief, for Kalonay and Father Paul are close behind\nme,\" she said.  \"They only stopped for a moment at the custom-house.\nKeep watch, Baron, and tell me when you see them coming.\"\n\nBarrat moved his chair so that it faced the garden-path, the King\ncrossed his legs comfortably and wrapped his padded dressing-robe\ncloser around his slight figure, and Erhaupt stood leaning on the back\nof his chair with his eyes fixed on the fine insolent beauty of the\nwoman before them.\n\nShe nodded her head toward the soldiers who sat at the entrance to the\nterrace, as silent and immovable as blind beggars before a mosque.  \"Do\nthey understand?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" the King assured her.  \"They understand nothing, but that they\nare to keep people away from me--and they do it very well.  I wish I\ncould import them to Paris to help Niccolas fight off creditors.\nContinue, we are most impatient.\"\n\n\"We left here last Sunday night, as you know,\" she said.  \"We passed\nAlgiers the next morning and arrived off the island at mid-day,\nanchoring outside in the harbor.  We flew the Royal Yacht Squadron's\npennant, and an owner's private signal that we invented on the way\ndown.  They sent me ashore in a boat, and Kalonay and Father Paul\ncontinued on along the southern shore, where they have been making\nspeeches in all the coast-towns and exciting the people in favor of the\nrevolution.  I heard of them often while I was at the capital, but not\nfrom them.  The President sent a company of carbineers to arrest them\nthe very night they returned and smuggled me on board the yacht again.\nWe put off as soon as I came over the side and sailed directly here.\n\n\"As soon as I landed on Tuesday I went to the Hotel de Messina, and\nsent my card to the President.  He is that man Palaccio, the\nhotel-keeper's son, the man you sent out of the country for writing\npamphlets against the monarchy, and who lived in Sicily during his\nexile.  He gave me an audience at once, and I told my story.  As he\nknew who I was, I explained that I had quarrelled with you, and that I\nwas now prepared to sell him the secrets of an expedition which you\nwere fitting out with the object of re-establishing yourself on the\nthrone.  He wouldn't believe that there was any such expedition, and\nsaid it was blackmail, and threatened to give me to the police if I did\nnot leave the island in twenty-four hours--he was exceedingly rude.  So\nI showed him receipts for ammunition and rifles and Maxim guns, and\ncopies of the oath of allegiance to the expedition, and papers of the\nyacht, in which she was described as an armored cruiser, and he rapidly\ngrew polite, even humble, and I made him apologize first, and then take\nme out to luncheon.  That was the first day.  The second day telegrams\nbegan to come in from the coast-towns, saying that the Prince Kalonay\nand Father Paul were preaching and exciting the people to rebellion,\nand travelling from town to town in a man-of-war.  Then he was\nfrightened.  The Prince with his popularity in the south was alarming\nenough, but the Prince and Father Superior to help him seemed to mean\nthe end of the Republic.\n\n\"I learned while I was down there that the people think the father put\nsome sort of a ban on every one who had anything to do with driving the\nDominican monks out of the island and with the destruction of the\nmonasteries.  I don't know whether he did or not, but they believe he\ndid, which is the same thing, and that superstitious little beast, the\nPresident, certainly believed it; he attributed everything that had\ngone wrong on the island to that cause.  Why, if a second cousin of the\nwife of a brother of one of the men who helped to fire a church falls\noff his horse and breaks his leg they say that he is under the curse of\nthe Father Superior, and there are many who believe the Republic will\nnever succeed until Paul returns and the Church is re-established.  The\nGovernment seems to have kept itself well informed about your Majesty's\nmovements, and it has never felt any anxiety that you would attempt to\nreturn, and it did not fear the Church party because it knew that\nwithout you the priests could do nothing.  But when Paul, whom the\ncommon people look upon as a living saint and martyr, returned hand in\nhand with your man Friday, they were in a panic and felt sure the end\nhad come.  So the President called a hasty meeting of his Cabinet.  And\nsuch a Cabinet!  I wish you could have seen them, Louis, with me in the\ncentre playing on them like an advocate before a jury.  They were the\nmost dreadful men I ever met, bourgeois and stupid and ugly to a\ndegree.  Two of them were commission-merchants, and one of them is old\nDr. Gustavanni, who kept the chemist's shop in the Piazza Royale.  They\nwere quite silly with fear, and they begged me to tell them how they\ncould avert the fall of the Republic and prevent your landing.  And I\nsaid that it was entirely a question of money; that if we were paid\nsufficiently the expedition would not land and we would leave them in\npeace, but that----\"\n\nThe King shifted his legs uneasily, and coughed behind his thin, pink\nfingers.\n\n\"That was rather indiscreet, was it not, Marie?\" he murmured.  \"The\nidea was to make them think that I, at least, was sincere; was not that\nit?  To make it appear that though there were traitors in his camp, the\nKing was in most desperate earnest?  If they believe that, you see, it\nwill allow me to raise another expedition as soon as the money we get\nfor this one is gone; but if you have let them know that I am the one\nwho is selling out, you have killed the goose that lays the golden\neggs.  They will never believe us when we cry wolf again----\"\n\n\"You must let me finish,\" Zara interrupted.  \"I did not involve you in\nthe least.  I said that there were traitors in the camp of whom I was\nthe envoy, and that if they would pay us 300,000 francs we would\npromise to allow the expedition only to leave the yacht.  Their troops\ncould then make a show of attacking our landing-party and we would\nraise the cry of `treachery' and retreat to the boats.  By this we\nwould accomplish two things,--we would satisfy those who, had\ncontributed funds toward the expedition that we had at least made an\nhonest effort, and your Majesty would be discouraged by such treachery\nfrom ever attempting another attack.  The money was to be paid two\nweeks later in Paris, to me or to whoever brings this ring that I wear.\nThe plan we finally agreed upon is this:  The yacht is to anchor off\nBasnai next Thursday night.  At high tide, which is just about\ndaybreak, we are to lower our boats and land our men on that long beach\nto the south of the break-water.  The troops of the Republic are to lie\nhidden in the rocks until our men have formed.  Then they are to fire\nover their heads, and we are to retreat in great confusion, return to\nthe yacht, and sail away.  Two weeks later they are to pay the money\ninto my hands, or,\" she added, with a smile, as she held up her fourth\nfinger, \"to whoever brings this ring.  And I need not say that the ring\nwill not leave my finger.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, as though the men were waiting to learn if\nshe had more to tell, and then the King threw back his head and laughed\nsoftly.  He saw Erhaupt's face above his shoulder, filled with the\namazement and indignation of a man who as a duellist and as a soldier\nhad shown a certain brute courage, and the King laughed again.\n\n\"What do you think of that, Colonel?\" he cried, gayly.  \"They are a\nnoble race, my late subjects.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the German.  \"I didn't know we were dealing with a\nhome for old women.\"\n\nThe Baron laughed comfortably.  \"It is like taking money from a blind\nbeggar's hat,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, with two hundred men that I could pick up in London,\" Erhaupt\ndeclared, contemptuously, \"I would guarantee to put you on the throne\nin a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" exclaimed his Majesty.  \"So they surrendered as\nquickly as that, did they?\" he asked, nodding toward Madame Zara to\ncontinue.\n\nThe Countess glanced again over her shoulder and bit her lips in some\nchagrin.  Her eyes showed her disappointment.  \"It may seem an easy\nvictory to you,\" she said, consciously, \"but I doubt, knowing all the\ncircumstances, if any of your Majesty's gentlemen could have served you\nas well.  It needed a woman and----\"\n\n\"It needed a beautiful woman,\" interrupted the King, quickly, in a tone\nthat he would have used to a spoiled child.  \"It needed a woman of\ntact, a woman of courage, a woman among women--the Countess Zara.  Do\nnot imagine, Marie, that we undervalue your part.  It is their lack of\ncourage that distresses Colonel Erhaupt.\"\n\n\"One of them, it is true, did wish to fight,\" the Countess continued,\nwith a smile; \"a Frenchman named Renauld, whom they have put in charge\nof the army.  He scoffed at the whole expedition, but they told him\nthat a foreigner could not understand as they did the danger of the\npopularity of the Prince Kolonay, who, by a speech or two among the\nshepherds and fishermen, could raise an army.\"\n\nThe King snapped his fingers impatiently.\n\n\"An army of brigands and smugglers!\" he exclaimed.  \"That for his\npopularity!\"  But he instantly raised his hands as though in protest at\nhis own warmth of speech and in apology for his outbreak.\n\n\"His zeal will ruin us in time.  He is deucedly in the way,\" he\ncontinued, in his usual tone of easy cynicism.  \"We should have let him\ninto our plans from the first, and then if he chose to take no part in\nthem we would at least have had a free hand.  As it is now, we have\nthree different people to deceive: this Cabinet of shopkeepers, which\nseems easy enough; Father Paul and his fanatics of the Church party;\nand this apostle of the divine right of kings, Kalonay.  And he and the\ngood father are not fools----\"\n\nAt these words Madame Zara glanced again toward the garden, and this\ntime with such evident uneasiness in her face that Barrat eyed her with\nquick suspicion.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, sharply.  \"There is something you have not told\nus.\"\n\nThe woman looked at the King, and he nodded his head as though in\nassent.  \"I had to tell them who else was in the plot besides myself,\"\nshe said, speaking rapidly.  \"I had to give them the name of some man\nwho they knew would be able to do what I have promised we could do--who\ncould put a stop to the revolution.  The name I gave was\nhis--Kalonay's.\"\n\nBarrat threw himself forward in his chair.\n\n\"Kalonay's?\" he cried, incredulously.\n\n\"Kalonay's?\" echoed Erhaupt.  \"What madness, Madame!  Why name the only\none who is sincere?\"\n\n\"She will explain,\" said the King, in an uneasy voice; \"let her\nexplain.  She has acted according to my orders and for the best, but I\nconfess I----\"\n\n\"Some one had to be sacrificed,\" returned the woman, boldly, \"and why\nnot he?  Indeed, if we wish to save ourselves, there is every reason\nthat it should be he.  You know how mad he is for the King's return,\nhow he himself wishes to get back to the island and to his old position\nthere.  Why, God only knows, but it is so.  What pleasure he finds in a\nland of mists and fogs, in a ruined castle with poachers and smuggling\nfishermen for companions, I cannot comprehend.  But the fact remains,\nhe always speaks of it as home and he wishes to return.  And now,\nsuppose he learns the truth, as he may at any moment, and discovers\nthat the whole expedition for which he is staking his soul and life is\na trick, a farce; that we use it only as a bait to draw money from the\nold nobility, and to frighten the Republic into paying us to leave them\nin peace?  How do we know what he might not do?  He may tell the whole\nof Europe.  He may turn on you and expose you, and then what have we\nleft?  It is your last chance.  It is our last chance.  We have tried\neverything else, and we cannot show ourselves in Europe, at least not\nwithout money in our hands.  But by naming Kalonay I have managed it so\nthat we have only to show the written agreement I have made with the\nRepublic and he is silenced.  In it they have promised to pay the\nPrince Kalonay, naming him in full, 300,000 francs if the expedition is\nwithdrawn.  That agreement is in my hands, and that is our answer to\nwhatever he may think or say.  Our word is as good as his, or as bad;\nwe are all of the same party as far as Europe cares, and it becomes a\nfalling out among thieves, and we are equal.\"\n\nBaron Barrat leaned forward and marked each word with a movement of his\nhand.\n\n\"Do I understand you to say,\" he asked, \"that you have a paper signed\nby the Republic agreeing to pay 300,000 francs to Kalonay?  Then how\nare we to get it?\" he demanded, incredulously.  \"From him?\"\n\n\"It is made payable to him,\" continued the woman, \"or to whoever brings\nthis ring I wear to the banking-house of the Schlevingens two weeks\nafter the expedition has left the island.  I explained that clause to\nthem by saying that Kalonay and I were working together against the\nKing, and as he might be suspicious if we were both to leave him so\nsoon after the failure of the expedition we would be satisfied if they\ngave the money to whichever one first presented the ring.  Suppose I\nhad said,\" she went on, turning to the King, \"that it was either Barrat\nor the Colonel here who had turned traitor.  They know the Baron of\nold, when he was Chamberlain and ran your roulette wheel at the palace.\nThey know he is not the man to turn back an expedition.  And the\nColonel, if he will pardon me, has sold his services so often to one\nside or another that it would have been difficult to make them believe\nthat this time he is sincere.  But Kalonay, the man they fear most next\nto your Majesty--to have him turn traitor, why, that was a master\nstroke.  Even those boors, stupid as they are, saw that.  When they\nmade out the agreement they put down all his titles, and laughed as\nthey wrote them in.  `Prince Judas' they called him, and they were in\necstasies at the idea of the aristocrat suing for blood-money against\nhis sovereign, of the man they feared showing himself to be only a\ncommon blackmailer.  It delighted them to find a prince royal sunk\nlower than themselves, this man who has treated them like curs--like\nthe curs they are,\" she broke out suddenly--\"like the curs they are!\"\n\nShe rose and laughed uneasily as though at her own vehemence.\n\n\"I am tired,\" she said, avoiding the King's eyes; \"the trip has tired\nme.  If you will excuse me, I will go to my rooms--through your\nhall-way, if I may.\"\n\n\"Most certainly,\" said the King.  \"I trust you will be rested by\ndinner-time.  Au revoir, my fair ambassadrice.\"\n\nThe woman nodded and smiled back at him brightly, and Louis continued\nto look after her as she disappeared down the corridor.  He rubbed the\nback of his fingers across his lips, and thoughtfully examined his\nfinger-nails.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said, after a pause, looking up at Barrat.  The Baron\nraised his eyebrows with a glance of polite interrogation.\n\n\"I wonder if Kalonay dared to make love to her on the way down.\"\n\nThe Baron's face became as expressionless as a death-mask, and he\nshrugged his shoulders in protest.\n\n\"--Or did she make love to Kalonay?\" the King insisted, laughing\ngently.  \"I wonder now.  I do not care to know, but I wonder.\"\n\nAccording to tradition the Kalonay family was an older one than that of\nthe House of Artois, and its name had always been the one next in\nimportance to that of the reigning house.  The history of Messina\nshowed that different members of the Kalonay family had fought and died\nfor different kings of Artois, and had enjoyed their favor and shared\ntheir reverses with equal dignity, and that they had stood like a\nrampart when the kingdom was invaded by the levelling doctrines of\nRepublicanism and equality.  And though the Kalonays were men of\nstouter stuff than their cousins of Artois, they had never tried to\nusurp their place, but had set an example to the humblest shepherd of\nunfailing loyalty and good-will to the King and his lady.  The Prince\nKalonay, who had accompanied the Dominican monk to Messina, was the\nlast of his race, and when Louis IV. had been driven off the island, he\nhad followed his sovereign into exile as a matter of course, and with\nhis customary good-humor.  His estates, in consequence of this step,\nhad been taken up by the Republic, and Kalonay had accepted the loss\nphilosophically as the price one pays for loving a king.  He found\nexile easy to bear in Paris, and especially so as he had never\nrelinquished the idea that some day the King would return to his own\nagain.  So firmly did he believe in this, and so keenly was his heart\nset upon it, that Louis had never dared to let him know that for\nhimself exile in Paris and the Riviera was vastly to be preferred to\nauthority over a rocky island hung with fogs, and inhabited by dull\nmerchants and fierce banditti.\n\nThe conduct of the King during their residence in Paris would have\ntried the loyalty of one less gay and careless than Kalonay, for he was\na sorry monarch, and if the principle that \"the King can do no wrong\"\nhad not been bred in the young Prince's mind, he would have deserted\nhis sovereign in the early days of their exile.  But as it was, he made\nexcuses for him to others and to himself, and served the King's idle\npurposes so well that he gained for himself the name of the King's\njackal, and there were some who regarded him as little better than the\nKing's confidential blackguard, and man Friday, the weakest if the most\ncharming of his court of adventurers.\n\nAt the first hint which the King gave of his desire to place himself\nagain in power, Kalonay had ceased to be his Jackal and would have\nissued forth as a commander-in-chief, had the King permitted him; but\nit was not to Louis's purpose that the Prince should know the real\nobject of the expedition, so he assigned its preparation to Erhaupt,\nand despatched Kalonay to the south of the island.  At the same time\nMadame Zara had been sent to the north of the island, ostensibly to\nsound the sentiment of the old nobility, but in reality to make capital\nout of the presence there of Kalonay and Father Paul.\n\nThe King rose hurriedly when the slim figure of the Prince and the\nbroad shoulders and tonsured head of the monk appeared at the farthest\nend of the garden-walk.\n\n\"They are coming!\" he cried, with a guilty chuckle; \"so I shall run\naway and finish dressing.  I leave you to receive the first shock of\nKalonay's enthusiasm alone.  I confess he bores me.  Remember, the\nstory Madame Zara told them in the yacht is the one she told us this\nmorning, that none of the old royalists at the capital would promise us\nany assistance.  Be careful now, and play your parts prettily.  We are\nall terribly in earnest.\"\n\nKalonay's enthusiasm had not spent itself entirely before the King\nreturned.  He had still a number of amusing stories to tell, and he\nreviewed the adventures of the monk and himself with such vivacity and\nhumor that the King nodded his head in delight, and even the priest\nsmiled indulgently at the recollection.\n\nKalonay had seated himself on one of the tables, with his feet on a\nchair and with a cigarette burning between his fingers.  He was a\nhandsome, dark young man of thirty, with the impulsive manner of a boy.\nDissipation had left no trace on his face, and his eyes were as\ninnocent of evil and as beautiful as a girl's, and as eloquent as his\ntongue.  \"May the Maria Santissima pity the girls they look upon,\" his\nold Spanish nurse used to say of them.  But Kalonay had shown pity for\nevery one save himself.  His training at an English public school, and\nlater as a soldier in the Ecole Polytechnique at Paris, had saved him\nfrom a too early fall, and men liked him instinctively, and the women\nmuch too well.\n\n\"It was good to be back there again,\" he cried, with a happy sigh.  \"It\nwas good to see the clouds following each other across the old\nmountains and throwing black shadows on the campagna, and to hear the\npeople's patois and to taste Messinian wine again and to know it was\nfrom your own hillside.  All our old keepers came down to the coast to\nmeet us, and told me about the stag-hunt the week before, and who was\nmarried, and who was in jail, and who had been hanged for shooting a\ncustoms officer, and they promised fine deer stalking if I get back\nbefore the snow leaves the ridges, for they say the deer have not been\nhunted and are running wild.\" He stopped and laughed.  \"I forgot,\" he\nsaid, \"your Majesty does not care for the rude pleasures of my half of\nthe island.\"  Kalonay threw away his cigarette, clasping his hands\nbefore him with a sudden change of manner.\n\n\"But seriously,\" he cried, \"as I have been telling them--I wish your\nMajesty could have heard the offers they made us, and could have seen\nthe tears running down their faces when we assured them that you would\nreturn.  I wished a thousand times that we had brought you with us.\nWith you at our head we can sweep the island from one end to the other.\nWe will gather strength and force as we go, as a landslide grows, and\nwhen we reach the capital we will strike it like a human avalanche.\n\n\"And I wish you could have heard him speak,\" Kalonay cried, his\nenthusiasm rising as he turned and pointed with his hand at the priest.\n\"There is the leader!  He made my blood turn hot with his speeches, and\nwhen he had finished I used to find myself standing on my tiptoes and\nshouting with the rest.  Without him I could have done nothing.  They\nknew me too well; but the laziest rascals in the village came to\nwelcome him again, and the women and men wept before him and brought\ntheir children to be blessed, and fell on their knees and kissed his\nsandals.  It was like the stories they tell you when you are a child.\nHe made us sob with regret and he filled us with fresh resolves.  Oh,\nit is very well for you to smile, you old cynics,\" he cried, smiling at\nhis own fervor, \"but I tell you, I have lived since I saw you last!\"\n\nThe priest stood silent with his hands hidden inside his great sleeves,\nand his head rising erect and rigid from his cowl.  The eyes of the men\nwere turned upon him curiously, and he glanced from one to the other,\nas though mistrusting their sympathy.\n\n\"It was not me--it was the Church they came to welcome.  The fools,\" he\ncried bitterly, \"they thought they could destroy the faith of the\npeople by banishing the servants of the Church.  As soon end a mother's\nlove for her children by putting an ocean between them.  For six years\nthose peasants have been true.  I left them faithful, I returned to\nfind them faithful.  And now--\" he concluded, looking steadily at the\nKing as though to hold him to account, \"and now they are to have their\nreward.\"\n\nThe King bowed his head gravely in assent.  \"They are to have their\nreward,\" he repeated.  He rose and with a wave of his hand invited the\npriest to follow him, and they walked together to the other end of the\nterrace.  When they were out of hearing of the others the King seated\nhimself, and the priest halted beside his chair.\n\n\"I wish to speak with you, father,\" Louis said, \"concerning this young\nAmerican girl, Miss Carson, who has promised to help us--to help\nyou--with her money.  Has she said yet how much she means to give us,\"\nasked the King, \"and when she means to let us have it?  It is a\ndelicate matter, and I do not wish to urge the lady, but we are really\ngreatly in need of money.  Baron Barrat, who arrived from Paris this\nmorning, brings back no substantial aid, although the sympathy of the\nold nobility, he assures me, is with us.  Sympathy, however, does not\npurchase Maxim guns, nor pay for rations, and Madame Zara's visit to\nthe capital was, as you know, even less successful.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty has seen Miss Carson, then?\" the priest asked.\n\n\"Yes, her mother and she have been staying at the Continental ever\nsince they followed you here from Paris, and I have seen her once or\ntwice during your absence.  The young lady seems an earnest daughter of\nour faith, and she is deeply in sympathy with our effort to\nre-establish your order and the influence of the Church upon the\nisland.  I have explained to her that the only way in which the Church\ncan regain her footing there is through my return to the throne, and\nMiss Carson has hinted that she is willing to make even a larger\ncontribution than the one she first mentioned.  If she means to do\nthis, it would be well if she did it at once.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have misunderstood her,\" said the priest, after a moment's\nconsideration; \"but I thought the sum she meant to contribute was to be\ngiven only after the monarchy has been formally established, and that\nshe wished whatever she gave to be used exclusively in rebuilding the\nchurches and the monastery.  I do not grudge it to your Majesty's\npurpose, but so I understood her.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is quite possible,\" returned Louis, easily; \"it may be that\nshe did so intend at first, but since I have talked with her she has\nshown a willing disposition to aid us not only later, but now.  My\nsuccess means your success,\" he continued, smiling pleasantly as he\nrose to his feet, \"so I trust you will urge her to be prompt.  She\nseems to have unlimited resources in her own right.  Do you happen to\nknow from whence her money comes?\"\n\n\"Her mother told me,\" said the priest, \"that Mr. Carson before his\ndeath owned mines and railroads.  They live in California, near the\nMission of Saint Francis.  I have written concerning them to the Father\nSuperior there, and he tells me that Mr. Carson died a very rich man,\nand that he was a generous servant of the Church.  His daughter has but\njust inherited her father's fortune, and her one idea of using it is to\ngive it to the Church, as he would have done.\"\n\nThe priest paused and seemed to consider what the King had just told\nhim.  \"I will speak with her,\" he said, \"and ask her aid as fully as\nshe can give it.  May I inquire how far your Majesty has taken her into\nour plans?\"\n\n\"Miss Carson is fully informed,\" the King replied briefly.  \"And if you\nwish to speak with her you can see her now; she and her mother are\ncoming to breakfast with me to hear the account of your visit to the\nisland.  You can speak with her then--and, father,\" the King added,\nlowering his eyes and fingering the loose sleeve of the priest's robe,\n\"it would be well, I think, to have this presentation of the young\nnobles immediately after the luncheon, while Miss Carson is still\npresent.  We might even make a little ceremony of it, and so show her\nthat she is fully in our confidence--that she is one of our most valued\nsupporters.  It might perhaps quicken her interest in the cause.\"\n\n\"I see no reason why that should not be,\" said the priest,\nthoughtfully, turning his eyes to the sea below them.  \"Madame Zara,\"\nhe added, without moving his eyes, \"will not be present.\"\n\nThe King straightened himself slightly, and for a brief moment of time\nlooked at the priest in silence, but the monk continued to gaze\nsteadily at the blue waters.\n\n\"Madame Zara will not be present,\" the King repeated, coldly.\n\n\"There are a few fishermen and mountaineers, your Majesty,\" the priest\ncontinued, turning an unconscious countenance to the King, \"who came\nback with us from the island.  They come as a deputation to inform your\nMajesty of the welcome that waits you, and I have promised them an\naudience.  If you will pardon me I would suggest that you receive these\nhonest people at the same time with the others, and that his Highness\nthe Crown Prince be also present, and that he receive them with you.\nTheir anxiety to see him is only second to their desire to speak to\nyour Majesty.  You will find some of your most loyal subjects among\nthese men.  Their forefathers have been faithful to your house and to\nthe Church for many generations.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the King; \"I shall receive them immediately after the\ndeputation from Paris.  Consult with Baron Barrat and Kalonay, please,\nabout the details.  I wish either Kalonay or yourself to make the\npresentation.  I see Miss Carson and her mother coming.  After\nluncheon, then, at, say, three o'clock--will that be satisfactory?\"\n\n\"As your Majesty pleases,\" the priest answered, and with a bow he\nstrode across the terrace to where Kalonay stood watching them.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nMrs. Carson and her daughter came from the hotel to the terrace through\nthe hallway which divided the King's apartments.  Baron Barrat preceded\nthem and they followed in single file, Miss Carson walking first.  It\nwas a position her mother always forced upon her, and after people grew\nto know them they accepted it as illustrating Mrs. Carson's confidence\nin her daughter's ability to care for herself, as well as her own wish\nto remain in the background.\n\nPatricia Carson, as she was named after her patron saint, or \"Patty\"\nCarson, as she was called more frequently, was an exceedingly pretty\ngirl.  She was tall and fair, with a smile that showed such confidence\nin everyone she met that few could find the courage to undeceive her by\nbeing themselves, and it was easier, in the face of such an appeal as\nher eyes made to the best in every one, for each to act a part while he\nwas with her.  She was young, impressionable, and absolutely\ninexperienced.  As a little girl she had lived on a great ranch, where\nshe could gallop from sunrise to sunset over her own prairie land, and\nlater her life had been spent in a convent outside of Paris.  She had\nbut two great emotions, her love for her father and for the Church\nwhich had nursed her.  Her father's death had sanctified him and given\nhim a place in her heart that her mother could not hold, and when she\nfound herself at twenty-one the mistress of a great fortune, her one\nidea as to the disposal of it was to do with it what would best please\nhim and the Church which had been the ruling power in the life of both\nof them.  She was quite unconscious of her beauty, and her mode of\nspeaking was simple and eager.\n\nShe halted as she came near the King, and resting her two hands on the\ntop of her lace parasol, nodded pleasantly to him and to the others.\nShe neither courtesied nor offered him her hand, but seemed to prefer\nthis middle course, leaving them to decide whether she acted as she did\nfrom ignorance or from choice.\n\nAs the King stepped forward to greet her mother, Miss Carson passed him\nand moved on to where the Father Superior stood apart from the others,\ntalking earnestly with the Prince.  What he was saying was of an\nunwelcome nature, for Kalonay's face wore an expression of boredom and\npolite protest which changed instantly to one of delight when he saw\nMiss Carson.  The girl hesitated and made a deep obeisance to the\npriest.\n\n\"I am afraid I interrupt you,\" she said.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Kalonay assured her, laughing.  \"It is a most welcome\ninterruption.  The good father has been finding fault with me, as\nusual, and I am quite willing to change the subject.\"\n\nThe priest smiled kindly on the girl, and while he exchanged some words\nof welcome with her, Kalonay brought up one of the huge wicker chairs,\nand she seated herself with her back to the others, facing the two men,\nwho stood leaning against the broad balustrade.  They had been\nfellow-conspirators sufficiently long for them to have grown to know\neach other well, and the priest, so far from regarding her as an\nintruder, hailed her at once as a probable ally, and endeavored to\nbegin again where he had ceased speaking.\n\n\"Do you not agree with me, Miss Carson?\" he asked.  \"I am telling the\nPrince that zeal is not enough, and that high ideals, unless they are\naccompanied by good conduct, are futile.  I want him to change, to be\nmore sober, more strict----\"\n\n\"Oh, you must not ask me,\" Miss Carson said, hurriedly, smiling and\nshaking her head.  \"We are working for only one thing, are we not?\nBeyond that you know nothing of me, and I know nothing of you.  I came\nto hear of your visit,\" she continued; \"am I to be told anything?\" she\nasked, eagerly, looking from one to the other.  \"It has been such an\nanxious two weeks.  We imagined all manner of things had happened to\nyou.\"\n\nKalonay laughed happily.  \"The Father was probably never safer in his\nlife,\" he said.  \"They took us to their hearts like brothers.  They\nmight have suffocated us with kindness, but we were in no other danger.\"\n\n\"Then you are encouraged, Father?\" she asked, turning to the priest.\n\"You found them loyal?  Your visit was all you hoped, you can depend\nupon them?\"\n\n\"We can count upon them absolutely,\" the monk assured her.  \"We shall\nstart on our return voyage at once, in a day, as soon as his Majesty\ngives the word.\"\n\n\"There are so many things I want to know,\" the girl said; \"but I have\nno right to ask,\" she added, looking up at him doubtfully.\n\n\"You have every right,\" the monk answered.  \"You have certainly earned\nit.  Without the help you gave us we could not have moved.  You have\nbeen more than generous----\"\n\nMiss Carson interrupted him with an impatient lifting of her head.\n\"That sort of generosity is nothing,\" she said.  \"With you men it is\ndifferent.  You are all risking something.  You are actually helping,\nwhile I must sit still and wait.  I hope, Father,\" she said, smiling,\n\"it is not wrong for me to wish I were a man.\"\n\n\"Wrong!\" exclaimed Kalonay, in a tone of mock dismay; \"of course it's\nwrong.  It's wicked.\"\n\nThe monk turned and looked coldly over his shoulder at Kalonay, and the\nPrince laughed.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"but we are told to be contented with our\nlot,\" he argued, impenitently.  \"`He only is a slave who complains,'\nand that is true even if a heretic did say it.\"\n\nThe monk shook his head and turned again to Miss Carson with a tolerant\nsmile.\n\n\"He is very young,\" he said, as though Kalonay did not hear him, \"and\nwild and foolish--and yet,\" he added, doubtfully, \"I find I love the\nboy.\"  He regarded the young man with a kind but impersonal scrutiny,\nas though he were a picture or a statue.  \"Sometimes I imagine he is\nall I might have been,\" he said, \"had not God given me the strength to\novercome myself.  He has never denied himself in anything; he is as\nwilful and capricious as a girl.  He makes a noble friend, Miss Carson,\nand a generous enemy; but he is spoiled irretrievably by good fortune\nand good living and good health.\"  The priest looked at the young man\nwith a certain sad severity.  \"`Unstable as water, thou shalt not\nexcel,'\" he said.\n\nThe girl, in great embarrassment, turned her head away, glancing from\nthe ocean to the sky; but Kalonay seated himself coolly on the broad\nbalustrade of the terrace with his hands on his hips, and his heels\nresting on the marble tiling, and clicked the soles of his boots\ntogether.\n\n\"Oh, I have had my bad days, too, Father,\" he said.  He turned his head\non one side, and pressed his lips together, looking down.\n\n\"Unstable as water--that is quite possible,\" he said, with an air of\nconsideration; \"but spoiled by good fortune--oh, no, that is not fair.\nDo you call it good fortune, sir,\" he laughed, \"to be an exile at\ntwenty-eight?  Is it good fortune to be too poor to pay your debts, and\ntoo lazy to work; to be the last of a great name, and to have no chance\nto add to the glory of it, and no means to keep its dignity fresh and\nsecure?  Do you fancy I like to see myself drifting farther and farther\naway from the old standards and the old traditions; to have English\nbrewers and German Jew bankers taking the place I should have, buying\ntitles with their earnings and snubbing me because I can only hunt when\nsomeone gives me a mount, and because I choose to take a purse instead\nof a cup when we shoot at Monte Carlo?\"\n\n\"What child's talk is this?\" interrupted the priest, angrily.  \"A\nthousand horses cannot make a man noble, nor was poverty ever ignoble.\nYou talk like a weak boy.  Every word you say is your own condemnation.\nWhy should you complain?  Your bed is of your own making.  The other\nprodigal was forced to herd with the swine--you have chosen to herd\nwith them.\"\n\nThe girl straightened herself and half rose from her chair.\n\n\"You are boring Miss Carson with my delinquencies,\" said the Prince,\nsternly.  His face was flushed, and he did not look either at the girl\nor at the priest.\n\n\"But the prodigal's father?\" said Miss Carson, smiling at the older\nman.  \"Did he stand over him and upbraid him?  You remember, he went to\nmeet him when he was yet a great way off.  That was it, was it not,\nFather?\"\n\n\"Of course he did,\" cried Kalonay, laughing like a boy, and slipping\nlightly to the terrace.  \"He met him half way and gave him the best he\nhad.\"  He stepped to Miss Carson's side and the two young people moved\naway smiling, and the priest, seeing that they were about to escape\nhim, cried eagerly, \"But that prodigal had repented.  This one----\"\n\n\"Let's run,\" cried the Prince.  \"He will get the best of us if we stay.\nHe always gets the best of me.  He has been abusing me that way for two\nweeks now, and he is always sorry afterward.  Let us leave him alone to\nhis sorrow and remorse.\"\n\nKalonay walked across the terrace with Miss Carson, bending above her\nwith what would have seemed to an outsider almost a proprietary right.\nShe did not appear to notice it, but looked at him frankly and listened\nto what he had to say with interest.  He was speaking rapidly, and as\nhe spoke he glanced shyly at her as though seeking her approbation, and\nnot boldly, as he was accustomed to do when he talked with either men\nor women.  To look at her with admiration was such a cheap form of\nappreciation, and one so distasteful to her, that had he known it,\nKalonay's averted eyes were more of a compliment than any words he\ncould have spoken.  His companions who had seen him with other women\nknew that his manner to her was not his usual manner, and that he gave\nher something he did not give to the others; that he was more discreet\nand less ready, and less at ease.\n\nThe Prince Kalonay had first met Miss Carson and her mother by chance\nin Paris, at the rooms of Father Paul, where they had each gone on the\nsame errand, and since that meeting his whole manner toward the two\nworlds in which he lived had altered so strangely that mere\nacquaintances noticed the change.\n\nBefore he had met her, the little the priest had said concerning her\nand her zeal for their common desire had piqued his curiosity, and his\nimagination had been aroused by the picture of a romantic young woman\ngiving her fortune to save the souls of the people of Messina; his\npeople whom he regarded and who regarded him less as a feudal lord than\nas a father and a comrade.  He had pictured her as a nervous, angular\nwoman with a pale, ascetic face, and with the restless eyes of an\nenthusiast, dressed in black and badly dressed, and with a severe and\nnarrow intelligence.  But he had prepared himself to forgive her\npersonality, for the sake of the high and generous impulse that\ninspired her.  And when he was presented to her as she really was, and\nfound her young, lovable, and nobly fair, the shock of wonder and\ndelight had held him silent during the whole course of her interview\nwith the priest, and when she had left them his brain was in a tumult\nand was filled with memories of her words and gestures, and of the\nsweet fearlessness of her manner.  Beautiful women he had known before\nas beautiful women, but the saving grace in his nature had never before\nbeen so deeply roused by what was fine as well as beautiful.  It seemed\nas though it were too complete and perfect.  For he assured himself\nthat she possessed everything--those qualities which he had never\nvalued before because he believed them to be unattainable, and those\nothers which he had made his idols.  She was with him, mind and heart\nand soul, in the one desire of his life that he took seriously; she was\nof his religion, she was more noble than his noble sisters, and she was\nmore beautiful than the day.  In the first glow of the meeting it\nseemed to him as though fate had called them to do this work\ntogether,--she from the far shore of the Pacific, and he from his rocky\nisland in the Middle Sea.  And he saw with cruel distinctness, that if\nthere were one thing wanting, it was himself.  He worshipped her before\nhe had bowed his first good-by to her, and that night he walked for\nmiles up and down the long lengths of the avenue of the Champs-Elysees,\nfacing the great change that she had brought into his life, but knowing\nhimself to be utterly unfit for her coming.  He felt like an unworthy\nsteward caught at his master's return unprepared, with ungirt loins,\nand unlighted lamp.  Nothing he had done since he was a child gave him\nthe right to consider himself her equal.  He was not blinded by the\napproaches which other daughters and the mothers of daughters had made\nhim.  He knew that what was enough to excuse many things in their eyes\nmight find no apology in hers.  He looked back with the awakening of a\nchild at the irrevocable acts in his life that could not be altered nor\ndug up nor hidden away.  They marked the road he had trodden like heavy\nmilestones, telling his story to every passer-by.  She could read them,\nas everyone else could read them.  He had wasted his substance, he had\nbartered his birthright for a moment's pleasure; there was no one so\nlow and despicable who could not call him comrade, to whom he had not\ngiven himself without reserve.  There was nothing left, and now the one\nthing he had ever wanted had come, and had found him like a bankrupt,\nhis credit wasted and his coffers empty.  He had placed himself at the\nbeck and call of every idle man and woman in Paris, and he was as\ncommon as the great clock-face that hangs above the boulevards.\n\nMiss Carson's feelings toward Kalonay were not of her own choosing, and\nhad passed through several stages.  When they had first met she had\nthought it most sad that so careless and unprincipled a person should\nchance to hold so important a part in the task she had set herself to\ndo.  She knew his class only by hearsay, but she placed him in it, and,\naccordingly, at once dismissed him as a person from her mind.  Kalonay\nhad never shown her that he loved her, except by those signs which any\nwoman can read and which no man can conceal; but he did not make love\nto her, and it was that which first prepossessed her in his favor.  One\nor two other men who knew of her fortune, and to whom she had given as\nlittle encouragement as she had to Kalonay, had been less considerate.\nBut his attitude toward her was always that of a fellow-worker in the\ncommon cause.  He treated her with a gratitude for the help she meant\nto give his people which much embarrassed her.  His seriousness pleased\nher with him, seeing, as she did, that it was not his nature to be\nserious, and his enthusiasm and love for his half-civilized countrymen\nincreased her interest in them, and her liking for him.  She could not\nhelp but admire the way in which he accepted, without forcing her to\nmake it any plainer, the fact that he held no place in her thoughts.\nAnd then she found that he began to hold more of a place in her\nthoughts than she had supposed any man could hold of whom she knew so\nlittle, and of whom the little she knew was so ill.  She missed him\nwhen she went to the priest's and found that he had not sent for\nKalonay to bear his part in their councils; and at times she felt an\nunworthy wish to hear Kalonay speak the very words she had admired him\nfor keeping from her.  And at last she learned the truth that she did\nlove him, and it frightened her, and made her miserable and happy.\nThey had not seen each other since he had left Paris for Messina, and\nthough they spoke now only of his mission to the island, there was back\nof what they said the joy for each of them of being together again and\nof finding that it meant so much.  What it might mean to the other,\nneither knew.\n\nFor some little time the King followed the two young people with his\neyes, and then joined them, making signs to Kalonay that he wished him\nto leave them together; but Kalonay remained blind to his signals, and\nBarrat, seeing that it was not a tete-a-tete, joined them also.  When\nhe did so Kalonay asked the King for a word, and laying his hand upon\nhis arm walked with him down the terrace, pointing ostensibly to where\nthe yacht lay in the harbor.  Louis answered his pantomime with an\nappropriate gesture, and then asked, sharply, \"Well, what is it?  Why\ndid you bring me here?  And what do you mean by staying on when you see\nyou are not wanted?\"\n\nThey were some distance from the others.  Kalonay smiled and made a\nslight bow.  \"Your Majesty,\" he began, with polite emphasis.  The King\nlooked at him curiously.\n\n\"In the old days under similar circumstances,\" the Prince continued,\nwith the air of a courtier rather than that of an equal, \"had I thought\nof forming an alliance by marriage, I should have come to your Majesty\nfirst and asked your gracious approval.  But those days are past, and\nwe are living at the end of the century; and we do such things\ndifferently.\"  He straightened himself and returned the King's look of\namused interest with one as cynical as his own.  \"What I wanted to tell\nyou, Louis,\" he said, quietly, \"is that I mean to ask Miss Carson to\nbecome the Princess Kalonay.\"\n\nThe King raised his head quickly and stared at the younger man with a\nlook of distaste and surprise.  He gave an incredulous laugh.\n\n\"Indeed?\" he said at last.  \"There was always something about rich\nwomen you could never resist.\"\n\nThe Prince made his acknowledgment with a shrug of his shoulders and\nsmiled indifferently.\n\n\"I didn't expect you to understand,\" he said.  \"It does seem odd; it's\nquite as difficult for me to understand as for you.  I have been\nthrough it a great many times, and I thought I knew all there was of\nit.  But now it seems different.  No, it does not seem different,\" he\ncorrected himself; \"it is different, and I love the lady and I mean to\nask her to do me the honor to marry me.  I didn't expect you to\nunderstand, I don't care if you do.  I only wanted to warn you.\"\n\n\"Warn me?\" interrupted the King, with an unpleasant smile.  \"Indeed!\nagainst what?  Your tone is a trifle peremptory--but you are\ninteresting, most interesting!  Kalonay in a new role, Kalonay in love!\nMost interesting!  Warn me against what?\" he repeated sharply.\n\n\"Your Majesty has a certain manner,\" the Prince began, with a pretence\nof hesitation, \"a charm of manner, I might say, which is proverbial.\nIt is, we know, attractive to women.  Every woman acknowledges it.  But\nyour Majesty is sometimes too gracious.  He permits himself to\ncondescend to many women, to any woman, to women of all classes----\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the King; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"What I mean is this,\" said Kalonay, lowering his voice and looking\ninto the King's half-closed eyes.  \"You can have all of Miss Carson's\nmoney you want--all you can get.  I don't want it.  If I am to--marry\nher at all, I am not marrying her for her money.  You can't believe\nthat.  It isn't essential that you should.  But I want you to leave the\nwoman I hope to make my wife alone.  I will allow no pretty speeches,\nnor royal attentions.  She can give her money where she pleases, now\nand always; but I'll not have her eyes opened to--as you can open them.\nI will not have her annoyed.  And if she is----\"\n\n\"Ah, and if she is?\" challenged the King.  His eyes were wide apart now\nand his lips were parted and drawn back from his teeth, like a snarling\ncat----\n\n\"I shall hold whoever annoys her responsible,\" Kalonay concluded,\nimpersonally.\n\nThere was a moment's pause, during which the two men stood regarding\neach other warily.\n\nThen the King stiffened his shoulders and placed his hands slowly\nbehind his back.  \"That sounds, my dear Kalonay,\" he said, \"almost like\na threat.\"\n\nThe younger man laughed insolently.  \"I meant it, too, your Majesty,\"\nhe answered, bowing mockingly and backing away.\n\nAs the King's guests seated themselves at his breakfast-table Louis\nsmiled upon them with a gracious glance of welcome and approval.  His\nmanner was charmingly condescending, and in his appearance there was\nnothing more serious than an anxiety for their better entertainment and\na certain animal satisfaction in the food upon his plate.\n\nIn reality his eyes were distributing the people at the table before\nhim into elements favorable or unfavorable to his plans, and in his\nmind he shuffled them and their values for him or against him as a\ngambler arranges and rearranges the cards in his hand.  He saw himself\nplainly as his own highest card, and Barrat and Erhaupt as willing but\nmediocre accomplices.  In Father Paul and Kalonay he recognized his\nmost powerful allies or most dangerous foes.  Miss Carson meant nothing\nto him but a source from which he could draw the sinews of war.  What\nwould become of her after the farce was ended, he did not consider.  He\nwas not capable of comprehending either her or her motives, and had he\nconcerned himself about her at all, he would have probably thought that\nshe was more of a fool than the saint she pretended to be, and that she\nhad come to their assistance more because she wished to be near a\nPrince and a King than because she cared for the souls of sixty\nthousand peasants.  That she would surely lose her money, and could\nhardly hope to escape from them without losing her good name, did not\nconcern him.  It was not his duty to look after the reputation of any\nAmerican heiress who thought she could afford to be unconventional.\nShe had a mother to do that for her, and she was pretty enough, he\nconcluded, to excuse many things,--so pretty that he wondered if he\nmight brave the Countess Zara and offer Miss Carson the attentions to\nwhich Kalonay had made such arrogant objections.  The King smiled at\nthe thought, and let his little eyes fall for a moment on the tall\nfigure of the girl with its crown of heavy golden hair, and on her\nclever, earnest eyes.  She was certainly worth waiting for, and in the\nmeanwhile she was virtually unprotected and surrounded by his own\npeople.  According to his translation of her acts, she had already\noffered him every encouragement, and had placed herself in a position\nwhich to his understanding of the world could have but one\ninterpretation.  What Kalonay's sudden infatuation might mean he could\nnot foresee; whether it promised good or threatened evil, he could only\nguess, but he decided that the young man's unwonted show of\nindependence of the morning must be punished.  His claim to exclusive\nproprietorship in the young girl struck the King as amusing, but\nimpertinent.  It would be easy sailing in spite of all, he decided; for\nsomewhere up above them in the hotel sat the unbidden guest, the woman\nagainst whom Father Paul had raised the ban of expulsion, but who had,\nnevertheless, tricked both him and the faithful Jackal.\n\nThe breakfast was drawing to an end and the faithful Niccolas was the\nonly servant remaining in the room.  The talk had grown intimate and\ntouched openly upon the successful visit of the two ambassadors to the\nisland, and of Barrat's mission to Paris.  Of Madame Zara's visit to\nthe northern half of the island, which was supposed to have been less\nsuccessful, no mention was made.\n\nLouis felt as he listened to them like a man at a play, who knows that\nat a word from him the complications would cease, and that were he to\nrise in the stalls and explain them away, and point out the real hero\nand denounce the villain, the curtain would have to ring down on the\ninstant.  He gave a little purr of satisfaction, and again marshalled\nhis chances before him and smiled to find them good.  He was grandly at\npeace with himself and with the world.  Whatever happened, he was\nalready richer by some 300,000 francs, and in a day, if he could keep\nthe American girl to her expedition had been played he would be\nfree,--free to return to his clubs and to his boulevards and boudoirs,\nwith money enough to silence the most insolent among his creditors, and\nwith renewed credit; with even a certain glamour about him of one who\nhad dared to do, even though he had failed in the doing, who had shaken\noff the slothfulness of ease and had chosen to risk his life for his\nthrone with a smoking rifle in his hand, until a traitor had turned\nfortune against him.\n\nThe King was amused to find that this prospect pleased him vastly.  He\nwas surprised to discover that, careless as he thought himself to be to\npublic opinion, he was still capable of caring for its approbation; but\nhe consoled himself for this weakness by arguing that it was only\nbecause the approbation would be his by a trick that it pleased him to\nthink of.  Perhaps some of his royal cousins, in the light of his bold\nintent, might take him under their protection instead of neglecting him\nshamefully, as they had done in the past.  His armed expedition might\nopen certain doors to him; his name--and he smiled grimly as he\nimagined it--would ring throughout Europe as the Soldier King, as the\nmodern disciple of the divine right of kings.  He saw, in his mind's\neye, even the possibility of a royal alliance and a pension from one of\nthe great Powers.  No matter where he looked he could see nothing but\ngain to himself, more power for pleasure, more chances of greater\nfortune in the future, and while his lips assented to what the others\nsaid, and his eyes thanked them for some expression of loyalty or\nconfidence, he saw himself in dreams as bright as an absinthe\ndrinker's, back in his beloved Paris: in the Champs-Elysees behind fine\nhorses, lolling from a silk box at the opera, dealing baccarat at the\njockey Club, or playing host to some beautiful woman of the hour, in\nthe new home he would establish for her in the discreet and leafy\nborders of the Bois.\n\nHe had forgotten his guests and the moment.  He had forgotten that\nthere were difficulties yet to overcome, and with a short, indrawn sigh\nof pleasure, he threw back his head and smiled arrogantly upon the\nsunny terrace and the green palms and the brilliant blue sea, as though\nhe challenged the whole beautiful world before him to do aught but\nminister to his success and contribute to his pleasures.\n\nAnd at once, as though in answer to his challenge, a tall, slim young\nman sprang lightly up the steps of the terrace, passed the bewildered\nguards with a cheery nod, and, striding before the open windows,\nknocked with his fist upon the portals of the door, as sharply and as\nconfidently as though the King's shield had hung there, and he had\nstruck it with a lance.\n\nThe King's dream shattered and faded away at the sound, and he moved\nuneasily in his chair.  He had the gambler's superstitious regard for\ntrifles, and this invasion of his privacy by a confident stranger\nfilled him with sudden disquiet.\n\nHe saw Kalonay staring at the open windows with an expression of\nastonishment and dismay.\n\n\"Who is it?\" the King asked, peevishly.  \"What are you staring at?  How\ndid he get in?\"\n\nKalonay turned on Barrat, sitting at his right.  \"Did you see him?\" he\nasked.  Barrat nodded gloomily.\n\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed the Prince, as though Barrat had confirmed his\nguess.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he said, nodding his head toward the\nwomen.  He pushed back his chair and stood irresolutely with his napkin\nin his hand.  \"Tell him we are not in, Niccolas,\" he commanded.\n\n\"He saw us as he passed the window,\" the Baron objected.\n\n\"Say we are at breakfast then.  I will see him myself in a moment.\nWhat shall I tell him?\" he asked, turning to Barrat.  \"Do you think he\nknows?  He must know, they have told him in Paris.\"\n\n\"You are keeping us waiting,\" said the King.  \"What is it?  Who is this\nman?\"\n\n\"An American named Gordon.  He is a correspondent,\" Kalonay answered,\nwithout turning his head.  His eyes were still fixed on the terrace as\nthough he had seen a ghost.\n\nThe King slapped his hand on the arm of the chair.  \"You promised me,\"\nhe said, \"that we should be free from that sort of thing.  That is why\nI agreed to come here instead of going to Algiers.  Go out, Barrat, and\nsend him away.\"\n\nBarrat pressed his lips together and shook his head.\n\n\"You can't send him away like that,\" he said.  \"He is a very important\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"Find out how much he will take, then,\" exclaimed the King, angrily,\n\"and give it to him.  I can better afford to pay blackmail to any\namount than have my plans spoiled now by the newspapers.  Give him what\nhe wants--a fur coat--they always wear fur coats--or five thousand\nfrancs, or something--anything--but get rid of him.\"\n\nBarrat stirred uneasily in his chair and shrugged his shoulders.  \"He\nis not a boulevard journalist,\" he replied, sulkily.\n\n\"Your Majesty is thinking of the Hungarian Jews at Vienna,\" explained\nKalonay, \"who live on chantage and the Monte Carlo propaganda fund.\nThis man is not in their class; he is not to be bought.  I said he was\nan American.\"\n\n\"An American!\" exclaimed Mrs. Carson and her daughter, exchanging rapid\nglances.  \"Is it Archie Gordon you mean?\" the girl asked.  \"I thought\nhe was in China.\"\n\n\"That is the man--Archie Gordon.  He writes books and explores places,\"\nKalonay answered.\n\n\"I know him.  He wrote a book on the slave trade in the Congo,\"\ncontributed Colonel Erhaupt.  \"I met him at Zanzibar.  What does he\nwant with us?\"\n\n\"He was in Yokohama when the Japanese-Chinese war broke out,\" said\nKalonay, turning to the King, \"and he cabled a London paper he would\nfollow the war for it if they paid him a hundred a week.  He meant\nAmerican dollars, but they thought he meant pounds, so they cabled back\nthat they'd pay one-half that sum.  He answered, `One hundred or\nnothing,' and they finally assented to that, and he started; and when\nthe first week's remittance arrived, and he received five hundred\ndollars instead of the one hundred he expected, he sent back the\ndifference.\"\n\n\"What a remarkable young man!\" exclaimed the King.  \"He is much too\ngood for daily wear.  We don't want anyone like that around here, do\nwe?\"\n\n\"I know Mr. Gordon very well,\" said Miss Carson.  \"He lived in San\nFrancisco before he came East.  He was always at our house, and was a\ngreat friend of the family; wasn't he, mother?  We haven't seen him for\ntwo years now, but I know he wouldn't spoil our plans for the sake of\nhis paper, if he knew we were in earnest, if he understood that\neverything depended upon its being kept a secret.\"\n\n\"We are not certain that he knows anything,\" the King urged.  \"He may\nnot have come here to see us.  I think Father Paul should talk with him\nfirst.\"\n\n\"I was going to suggest,\" said Miss Carson, with some hesitation, \"that\nif I spoke to him I might be able to put it to him in such a way that\nhe would see how necessary it----\"\n\n\"Oh, excellent!\" exclaimed the King, eagerly, and rising to his feet;\n\"if you only would be so kind, Miss Carson.\"\n\nKalonay, misunderstanding the situation altogether, fastened his eyes\nupon the table and did not speak.\n\n\"He has not come to see you, Patricia,\" said Mrs. Carson, quietly.\n\n\"He does not know that I am here,\" Miss Carson answered; \"but I'm sure\nif he did he would be very glad to see us again.  And if we do see him\nwe can make him promise not to do anything that might interfere with\nour plans.  Won't you let me speak to him, mother?\"\n\nMrs. Carson turned uncertainly to the priest for direction, and his\nglance apparently reassured her, for she rose, though still with a\ntroubled countenance, and the two women left the room together, the men\nstanding regarding each other anxiously across the table.  When they\nhad gone the King lit a cigarette and, turning his back on his\ncompanions, puffed at it nervously in silence.  Kalonay sat moodily\nstudying the pattern on the plate before him, and the others whispered\ntogether at the farther end of the table.\n\nWhen Miss Carson and her mother stepped out upon the terrace, the\nAmerican was standing with his back toward them and was speaking to the\nguards who sat cross-legged at the top of the steps.  They showed no\nsign of surprise at the fact of his addressing them in their own tongue\nfurther than that they answered him with a show of respect which they\nhad not exhibited toward those they protected.  The American turned as\nhe heard the footsteps behind him, and, after a startled look of\nastonishment, hurried toward the two women, exclaiming, with every\nexpression of pleasure.\n\n\"I had no idea you were stopping here,\" he said, after the first\ngreetings were over.  \"I thought you were somewhere on the Continent.\nI am so glad I caught you.  It seems centuries since I saw you last.\nYou're looking very well, Mrs. Carson--and as for Patty--I am almost\nafraid of her--I've been hearing all sorts of things about you lately,\nPatty,\" he went on, turning a smiling countenance toward the girl.\n\"About your engagements to princes and dukes--all sorts of disturbing\nrumors.  What a terrible swell you've grown to be.  I hardly recognize\nyou at all, Mrs. Carson.  It isn't possible this is the same young girl\nI used to take buggy riding on Sunday evenings?\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is not.  I wish it were,\" said Mrs. Carson, plaintively,\nsinking into a chair.  \"I'm glad to see you're not changed, Archie,\"\nshe added, with a sigh.\n\n\"Why, he's very much changed, mother,\" the girl said.  \"He's taller,\nand, in comparison with what he was, he's almost wasted away, and so\nsunburned I hardly knew him.  Except round the forehead,\" she added,\nmockingly, \"and I suppose the sun couldn't burn there because of the\nlaurel-wreaths.  I hear they bring them to you fresh every morning.\"\n\n\"They're better than coronets, at any rate,\" Gordon answered, with a\nnod.  \"They're not so common.  And if I'm wasted away, can you wonder?\nHow long has it been since I saw you, Patty?\"\n\n\"No, I'm wrong, he's not changed,\" Miss Carson said dryly, as she\nseated herself beside her mother.\n\n\"How do you two come to be stopping here?\" the young man asked.  \"I\nthought this hotel had been turned over to King Louis?\"\n\n\"It has,\" Mrs. Carson answered.  \"We are staying at the Continental, on\nthe hill there.  We are only here for breakfast.  He asked us to\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"He?\" repeated Gordon, with an incredulous smile.  \"Who?  Not the\nKing--not that blackguard?\"\n\nMiss Carson raised her head, and stared at him in silence, and her\nmother gave a little gasp, apparently of relief and satisfaction.\n\n\"Yes,\" Miss Carson answered at last, coldly.  \"We are breakfasting with\nhim.  What do you know against him?\"\n\nGordon stared at her with such genuine astonishment that the girl\nlowered her eyes, and, bending forward in her chair, twirled her\nparasol nervously between her fingers.\n\n\"What do I know against him?  Why, Patty!\" he exclaimed.  \"How did you\nmeet him, in Heaven's name?\" he asked, roughly.  \"Have you been seen\nwith him?  Have you known him long?  Who had the impudence to present\nhim?\"\n\nMrs. Carson looked up, now thoroughly alarmed.  Her lower lip was\ntrembling, and she twisted her gloved hands together in her lap.\n\n\"What do you know against him?\" Miss Carson repeated, meeting Gordon's\nlook with one as full of surprise as his own.\n\nThe young man regarded her steadily for a few moments, and then, with a\nchange of manner, as though he now saw the situation was much more\nserious than he had at first supposed, drew up a chair in front of the\ntwo women and seated himself deliberately.\n\n\"Has he borrowed any money from you yet?\" he asked.  Miss Carson's face\nflushed crimson and she straightened her shoulders and turned her eyes\naway from Gordon with every sign of indignation and disapproval.  The\nyoung man gave an exclamation of relief.\n\n\"No?  That's good.  You cannot have known him so very long.  I am\ngreatly relieved.\"\n\n\"Louis of Messina,\" he began more gently, \"is the most unscrupulous\nrascal in Europe.  Since they turned him out of his kingdom he has\nlived by selling his title to men who are promoting new brands of\nchampagne or floating queer mining shares.  The greater part of his\nincome is dependent on the generosity of the old nobility of Messina,\nand when they don't pay him readily enough, he levies blackmail on\nthem.  He owes money to every tailor and horse-dealer and hotel-keeper\nin Europe, and no one who can tell one card from another will play with\nhim.  That is his reputation.  And to help him live up to it he has\nsurrounded himself with a parcel of adventurers as rascally as himself:\na Colonel Erhaupt who was dropped from a German regiment, and who is a\nColonel only by the favor of the Queen of Madagascar; a retired\ncroupier named Barrat; and a fallen angel called Kalonay, a fellow of\nthe very best blood in Europe and with the very worst morals.  They\ncall him the King's jackal, and he is one of the most delightful\nblackguards I ever met.  So is the King for that matter, a most\nentertaining individual if you keep him in his place, but a man no\nwoman can know.  In fact, Mrs. Carson,\" Gordon went on, addressing\nhimself to the mother, \"when you have to say that a woman has\nabsolutely no reputation whatever you can best express it by explaining\nthat she has a title from Louis of Messina.  That is his Majesty's way\nof treating his feminine friends when they bore him and he wants to get\nrid of them.  He gives them a title.\n\n\"The only thing the man ever did that was to his credit and that could\nbe discussed in polite society is what he is doing now at this place,\nat this moment.  For it seems,\" Gordon whispered, drawing his chair\ncloser, \"that he is about to show himself something of a man after all,\nand that he is engaged in fitting out an armed expedition with which he\nhopes to recover his kingdom.  That's what brought me here, and I must\nsay I rather admire him for attempting such a thing.  Of course, it was\nKalonay who put him up to it; he would never have stirred from the\nboulevards if that young man had not made him.  But he is here,\nnevertheless, waiting for a favorable opportunity to sail, and he has\nten thousand rifles and three Maxim guns lying in his yacht out there\nin the harbor.  That's how I came to learn about it.  I was getting an\nestimate on an outfit I was thinking of taking into Yucatan from my old\ngunsmith in the Rue Scribe, and he dropped a hint that he had shipped\nten thousand rifles to Tangier, to Colonel Erhaupt.  I have met Erhaupt\nin Zanzibar, and knew he was the King's right-hand man, so I put two\nand two together and decided I would follow them up, and----\"\n\n\"Yes, and now,\" interrupted Miss Carson, sharply--\"and now that you\nhave followed them up, what do you mean to do?\"\n\nGordon looked his surprise at her earnestness, but answered that he did\nnot know what he would do; he thought he would either ask them to give\nhim a commission in their expedition, and let him help them fight, and\nwrite an account of their adventures later, or he would telegraph the\nstory at once to his paper.  It was with him, he said, entirely a\nquestion as to which course would be of the greater news value.  If he\ntold what he now knew, his paper would be the first of all others to,\ninform the world of the expedition and the proposed revolution; while\nif he volunteered for the expedition and waited until it had failed or\nsucceeded, he would be able to tell more eventually, but would have to\nshare it with other correspondents.\n\nMiss Carson regarded him with an expression in which indignation and\nentreaty were curiously blended.\n\n\"Archie,\" she said, in a low voice, \"you do not know what you are doing\nor saying.  You are threatening to spoil the one thing in my life on\nwhich I have set my heart.  The return of this man to his throne,\nwhether he is worthy or not, means the restoration of the Catholic\nChurch on that island; it means the return of the monks and the\nrebuilding of the monasteries, and the salvation of sixty thousand\nsouls.  I know all that they mean to do.  I am the one who paid for\nthose rifles that brought you here; you have told me only what I have\nknown for months, and for which I have been earnestly working and\npraying.  I am not blinded by these men.  They are not the creatures\nyou describe; but no matter what they may be, it is only through them,\nand through them alone, that I can do what I have set out to do.\"\n\nGordon silenced her with a sweep of his hand.  \"Do you mean to tell\nme,\" he demanded, \"that you are mixed up in this--with these--that they\nhave taken money from you, and told you they meant to use it to\nre-establish the Church?  Mrs. Carson,\" he exclaimed, bitterly, turning\nupon her, \"why have you allowed this--what have you been doing while\nthis was going on?  Do you suppose those scoundrels care for the\nChurch--the Church, indeed!  Wait until I see them--any of\nthem--Erhaupt by choice, and I'll make them give up every franc you've\nlent them, or I'll horsewhip and expose them for the gang of welshers\nand thimble-riggers they are; or if they prefer their own methods, I'll\ncall them out in rotation and shoot their arms and legs off.\"  He\nstopped and drew a long breath, either of content that he had\ndiscovered the situation in time to take some part in it, or at the\nprospect of a fight.\n\n\"The idea of you two helpless females wandering into this den of\nwolves!\" he exclaimed, indignantly.  \"It's about time you had a man to\nlook after you!  You go back to your hotel now, and let me have a chat\nwith Louis of Messina.  He's kept me waiting some twenty minutes as it\nis, and that's a little longer than I can give him.  I'm not a\ncreditor.\"  He rose from his chair; but Miss Carson put out her hand\nand motioned him to be seated.\n\n\"Archie,\" she said, \"I like the way you take this, even though you are\nall wrong about it, because it's just like you to fly into a passion\nand want to fight someone for somebody.  If your conclusions were\nanywhere near the truth, you would be acting very well.  But they are\nnot.  The King is not handling my money, nor the Prince Kalonay.  It is\nin the keeping of Father Paul, the Father Superior of the Dominican\nmonks, who is the only one of these people I know or who knows me.  He\nis not a swindler, too, is he, or a retired croupier?  Listen to me\nnow, and do not fly out like that at me, or at mother.  It is not her\nfault.  Last summer mother and I went to Messina as tourists, and one\nday, when passing through a seaport town, we saw a crowd of people on\nthe shore, standing or kneeling by the hundreds in a great semicircle\nclose to the water's edge.  There was a priest preaching to them from\nan open boat.  It was like a scene from the New Testament, and the man,\nthis Father Paul, made me think of one of the disciples.  I asked them\nwhy he did not preach on the land, and they told me that he and all of\nthe priests had been banished from the island six years before, and\nthat they could only return by stealth and dared not land except by\nnight.  When the priest had finished speaking, I had myself rowed out\nto his boat, and I talked a long time with him, and he told me of this\nplan to re-establish himself and his order.  I offered to help him with\nmy money, and he promised me a letter to Cardinal Napoli.  It reached\nme on my return to Rome, and through the influence of the Cardinal I\nwas given an audience with the Pope, and I was encouraged to aid Father\nPaul as far as I could.  I had meant to build a memorial church for\nfather, but they urged me to give the money instead to this cause.  All\nmy dealings until to-day have been with Father Paul alone.  I have seen\na little of the Prince Kalonay because they are always together; but he\nhas always treated me in a way to which no one could take exception,\nand he is certainly very much in earnest.  When Father Paul left Paris\nmother and I came on here in order to be near him, and that is how you\nfind me at Tangier.  And now that you understand how much this means to\nme, I know you will not do anything to stand in our way.  Those men\ninside are afraid that you came here for just the reason that\napparently has brought you, and when they saw you a little while ago\nthrough the windows they were greatly disturbed.  Let me tell them that\nyou mean to volunteer for the campaign.  The King cannot refuse the\nservices of a man who has done the things you are always doing.  And I\npromise you that for a reward you shall be the only one to tell the\nstory of our attempt.  I promise you,\" she repeated earnestly, \"that\nthe day we enter the capital, you can cable whatever you please and\ntell our story to the whole of Europe.\"\n\n\"The story be hanged!\" replied Gordon.  \"You have made this a much more\nserious business than a newspaper story.  You misunderstand me utterly,\nPatty.  I am here now because I am not going to have you compromised\nand robbed.\"\n\nThe girl stood up and looked down at the young man indignantly.\n\n\"You have no right whatever to use that tone to me,\" she said.  \"I am\nof age and my own adviser.  I am acting for the good of a great number\nof people, and according to what my conscience and common sense tell me\nis right.  I shall hate you if you attempt to interfere.  You can do\none of two things, Archie.  I give you your choice: you can either go\nwith them as a volunteer, and promise to keep our secret; or you can\ncable what you know now, what you know only by accident, but if you do,\nyou will lose your best friend, and you will defeat a good and a noble\neffort.\"\n\nGordon leaned back in his chair, and looked up at her steadily for a\nbrief moment, and then rose with a smile, and bowed to the two women in\nsilence.  He crossed the terrace quickly with an amused and puzzled\ncountenance, and walked into the breakfast-room, from the windows of\nwhich, as he rightly guessed, the five conspirators had for some time\nobserved him.  He looked from one to the other of the men about the\ntable, until his eyes finally met those of the King.\n\n\"I believe, sir, you are leading an expedition against the Republic of\nMessina?\" Gordon said.  \"I am afraid it can't start unless you take me\nwith you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe presence in Tangier of the King of Messina and his suite, and the\narrival there of the French noblemen who had volunteered for the\nexpedition, could not escape the observation of the resident\nConsuls-General and of the foreign colony, and dinners, riding and\nhunting parties, pig-sticking, and excursions on horseback into the\noutlying country were planned for their honor and daily entertainment.\nHad the conspirators held aloof from these, the residents might have\nasked, since it was not to enjoy themselves, what was the purpose of\ntheir stay in Tangier; and so, to allay suspicion as to their real\nobject, different members of the expedition had been assigned from time\nto time to represent the visitors at these festivities.  On the morning\nfollowing the return of the yacht from Messina, an invitation to ride\nto a farmhouse some miles out of Tangier and to breakfast there had\nbeen sent to the visitors, and the King had directed the Prince\nKalonay, and half of the delegation from Paris, to accept it in his\nname.\n\nThey were well content to go, and rode forth gayly and in high spirits,\nfor the word had been brought them early in the morning that the\nexpedition was already prepared to move, and that same evening at\nmidnight the yacht would set sail for Messina.  They were careless as\nto what fortune waited for them there.  The promise of much excitement,\nof fighting and of danger, of possible honor and success, stirred the\nhearts of the young men gloriously, and as they galloped across the\nplains, or raced each other from point to point, or halted to jump\ntheir ponies across the many gaping crevices which the sun had split in\nthe surface of the plain, they filled the still, warm air with their\nshouts and laughter.  In the party there were many ladies, and the\ngroups changed and formed again as they rode forward, spread out on\neither side of the caravan-trail and covering the plain like a skirmish\nline of cavalry.  But Kalonay kept close at Miss Carson's stirrup,\nwhether she walked her pony or sent him flying across the hard,\nsunbaked soil.\n\n\"I hope you won't do that again,\" he said, earnestly, as she drew up\npanting, with her sailor hat and hair falling to her shoulders.  They\nhad been galloping recklessly over the open crevices in the soil.\n\n\"It's quite the nastiest country I ever saw,\" he said.  \"It looks as\nthough an earthquake had shaken it open and had forgotten to close it\nagain.  Believe me, it is most unsafe and dangerous.  Your pony might\nstumble--\" He stopped, as though the possibilities were too serious for\nwords, but the girl laughed.\n\n\"It's no more dangerous than riding across our prairie at dusk when you\ncan't see the barbed wire.  You are the last person in the world to\nfind fault because a thing is dangerous,\" she added.\n\nThey had reached the farm, where they went to breakfast, and the young\nEnglishman who was their host was receiving his guests in his garden,\nand the servants were passing among them, carrying cool drinks and\npowdered sweets and Turkish coffee.  Kalonay gave their ponies to a\nservant and pointed with his whip to an arbor that stood at one end of\nthe garden.\n\n\"May we sit down there a moment until they call us?\" he said.  \"I have\nnews of much importance--and I may not have another chance,\" he begged,\nlooking at her wistfully.  The girl stood motionless; her eyes were\nserious, and she measured the distance down the walk to the arbor as\nthough she saw it beset with dangers more actual than precipices and\ntwisted wire.  The Prince watched her as though his fate was being\nweighed in his presence.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said at last, and moved on before him down the\ngarden-path.\n\nThe arbor was open to the air with a low, broad roof of palm-leaves\nthat overhung it on all sides and left it in deep shadow.  Around it\nwere many strange plants and flowers, some native to Morocco and some\ntransplanted from their English home.  From where they sat they could\nsee the other guests moving in and out among the groves of orange and\nolive trees and swaying palms, and standing, outlined against the blue\nsky, upon the low, flat roof of the farm-house.\n\n\"I have dared to ask you to be so good as to give me this moment,\" the\nPrince said humbly, \"only because I am going away, and it may be my\nlast chance to speak with you.  You do not mind?  You do not think I\npresume?\"\n\n\"No, I do not mind,\" said the girl, smiling.  \"In my country we do not\nthink it a terrible offence to talk to a girl at a garden-party.  But\nyou said there was something of importance you wanted to say to me.\nYou mean the expedition?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kalonay.  \"We start this evening.\"  The girl raised her\nhead slightly and stared past him at the burning white walls and the\nburning blue sky that lay outside the circle of shadow in which they\nsat.\n\n\"This evening--\" she repeated to herself.\n\n\"We reach there in two days,\" Kalonay continued; \"and then we--then we\ngo on--until we enter the capital.\"\n\nThe girl's head was bent, and she looked at her hands as they lay in\nher lap and frowned at them, they seemed so white and pretty and\nuseless.\n\n\"Yes, you go on,\" she repeated, \"and we stay here.  You are a man and\nable to go on.  I know what that means.  And you like it,\" she added,\nwith a glance of mingled admiration and fear.  \"You are glad to fight\nand to risk death and to lead men on to kill other men.\"\n\nKalonay drew lines in the sand with his ridingwhip, and did not raise\nhis head.\n\n\"I suppose it is because you are fighting for your home,\" the girl\ncontinued, \"and to set your country free, and that you can live with\nyour own people again, and because it is a holy war.  That must be it.\nNow that it is really come, I see it all differently.  I see things I\nhad not thought about before.  They frighten me,\" she said.\n\nThe Prince raised his head and faced the girl, clasping the end of his\nwhip nervously in his hand.  \"If we should win the island for the\nKing,\" he said, \"I believe it will make a great change in me.  I shall\nbe able to go freely then to my home, as you say, to live there always,\nto give up the life I have led on the Continent.  It has been a foolish\nlife--a dog's life--and I have no one to blame for it but myself.  I\nmade it worse than it need to have been.  But if we win, I have\npromised myself that I will not return to it; and if we fall I shall\nnot return to it, for the reason that I shall have been killed.  I\nshall have much power if we win.  When I say much power, I mean much\npower in Messina, in that little corner of the world, and I wish to use\nit worthily and well.  I am afraid I should not have thought of it,\" he\nwent on, naively, as though he were trying to be quite fair, \"had not\nFather Paul pointed out to me what I should do, how I could raise the\npeople and stop the abuses which made them drive us from the island.\nThe people must be taxed less heavily, and the money must be spent for\nthem and not for us, on roads and harbors and schools, not at the\nPalace on banquets and fetes.  These are Father Paul's ideas, not\nmine,--but now I make them mine.\" He rose and paced the length of the\nlittle arbor, his hands clasped behind him and his eyes bent on the\nground.  \"Yes, that is what I mean to do,\" he said.  \"That is the way I\nmean to live.  And if we fail, I mean to be among those who are to die\non the fortifications of the capital, so that with me the Kalonay\nfamily will end, and end fighting for the King, as many of my people\nhave done before me.  There is no other way.  For me there shall be no\nmore idleness nor exile.  I must either live on to help my people, or I\nmust die with them.\"  He stopped in his walk and regarded the girl\nclosely.  \"You may be thinking, it is easy for him to promise this, it\nis easy to speak of what one will do.  I know that.  I know that I can\npoint back at nothing I have done that gives me any right to ask you to\nbelieve me now.  But I do ask it, for if you believe me--believe what I\nsay--it makes it easier for me to tell you why after this I must live\nworthily.  But you know why?  You must know; it is not possible that\nyou do not know.\"\n\nHe sat down beside her on the bench, leaning forward and crushing his\nhands together on his knee.  \"It is because I love you.  Because I love\nyou so that everything which is not worthy is hateful to me, myself\nmost of all.  It is the only thing that counts.  I used to think I knew\nwhat love meant; I used to think love was a selfish thing that needed\nlove in return, that it must be fed on love to live, that it needed\nvows and tender speeches and caresses, or it would die.  I know now\nthat when one truly cares, he does not ask whether the other cares or\nnot.  It is what one gives that counts, not what one receives.  You\nhave given me nothing--nothing--not a word nor a look; yet since I have\nknown you I have been more madly happy in just knowing that you live\nthan I would have been had any other woman in all the world thrown\nherself into my arms and said she loved me above all other men.  I am\nnot fit to tell you this.  But to-night I go to try myself, either\nnever to see you again, or to come back perhaps more worthy to love\nyou.  Think of this when I am gone.  Do not speak to me now.  I may\nhave made you hate me for speaking so, or I may have made you pity me;\nso let me go not knowing, just loving you, worshipping you, and holding\nyou apart and above all other people.  I go to fight for you, do you\nunderstand?  Not for our Church, not for my people, but for you, to\nlive or die for you.  And I ask nothing from you but that you will let\nme love you always.\"\n\nThe Prince bent, and catching up Miss Carson's riding-gloves that lay\nbeside her on the bench, kissed them again and again, and then, rising\nquickly, walked out of the arbor into the white sunshine, and, without\nturning, mounted his pony and galloped across the burning desert in the\ndirection of Tangier.\n\nArchie Gordon had not been invited to join the excursion into the\ncountry, nor would he have accepted it, for he wished to be by himself\nthat he might review the situation and consider what lay before him.\nHe sat with his long legs dangling over the broad rampart which\noverlooks the harbor of Tangier.  He was whistling meditatively to\nhimself and beating an accompaniment to the tune with his heels.  At\nintervals he ceased whistling while he placed a cigar between his teeth\nand pulled upon it thoughtfully, resuming his tune again at the point\nwhere it had been interrupted.  Below him the waves ran up lazily on\nthe level beach and sank again, dragging the long sea-weed with them,\nas they swept against the sharp rocks, and exposed them for an instant,\nnaked and glistening in the sun.  On either side of him the town\nstretched to meet the low, white, sand-hills in a crescent of low,\nwhite houses pierced by green minarets and royal palms.  A warm sun had\nsent the world to sleep at mid-day, and an enforced peace hung over the\nglaring white town and the sparkling blue sea.  Gordon blinked at the\nglare, but his eyes showed no signs of drowsiness.  They were, on the\ncontrary, awake to all that passed on the high road behind him, and on\nthe sandy beach at his feet, while at the same time his mind was busily\noccupied in reviewing what had occurred the day before, and in\nadjusting new conditions.  At the hotel he had found that the situation\nwas becoming too complicated, and that it was impossible to feel sure\nof the truth of anything, or of the sincerity of anyone.  Since the\nluncheon hour the day before he had become a fellow-conspirator with\nmen who were as objectionable to him in every way as he knew he was\nobnoxious to them.  But they had been forced to accept him because, so\nthey supposed, he had them at the mercy of his own pleasure.  He knew\ntheir secret, and in the legitimate pursuit of his profession he could,\nif he chose, inform the island of Messina, with the rest of the world,\nof their intention toward it, and bring their expedition to an end,\nthough he had chosen, as a reward for his silence, to become one of\nthemselves.  Only the Countess Zara had guessed the truth, that it was\nGordon himself who was at their mercy, and that so long as the American\ngirl persisted in casting her fortunes with them her old young friend\nwas only too eager to make any arrangement with them that would keep\nhim at her side.\n\nIt was a perplexing position, and Gordon turned it over and over in his\nmind.  Had it not been that Miss Carson had a part in it he would have\nenjoyed the adventure, as an adventure, keenly.  He had no objections\nto fighting on the side of rascals, or against rascals.  He objected to\nthem only in the calmer moments of private life; and as he was of\ncourse ignorant that the expedition was only a make-believe, he felt a\ncertain respect for his fellow-conspirators as men who were willing to\nstake their lives for a chance of better fortune.  But that their\nbravery was of the kind which would make them hesitate to rob and\ndeceive a helpless girl he very much doubted; for he knew that even the\nbravest of warriors on their way to battle will requisition a herd of\ncattle or stop to loot a temple.  The day before, Gordon had witnessed\nthe brief ceremony which attended the presentation of the young\nnoblemen from Paris who had volunteered for the expedition in all good\nfaith, and he reviewed it and analyzed it as he sat smoking on the\nramparts.\n\nIt had been an impressive ceremony, in spite of the fact that so few\nhad taken part in it, but the earnestness of the visitors and the\nenthusiasm of Kalonay and the priest had made up for the lack of\nnumbers.  The scene had appealed to him as one of the most dramatic he\nhad witnessed in the pursuit of a calling in which looking on at real\ndramas was the most frequent duty, and he had enjoyed the strange\nmixture of ancient terms of address and titles with the modern manners\nof the men themselves.  It had interested him to watch Baron Barrat\nbring out the ancient crown and jewelled sceptre which had been the\nregalia of all the Kings of Messina since the Crusades and spread them\nout upon a wicker tea-table, from which Niccolas had just removed some\nempty coffee-cups, half filled with the ends of cigarettes, some\nyellow-backed novels, and a copy of the Paris Figaro.  It was also\ninteresting to him to note how the sight of the little heir-apparent\naffected both the peasants from the mountains and the young nobles from\nthe Club Royale.  The former fell upon their knees with the tears\nrolling down the furrows in their tanned cheeks, while the little\nwise-eyed boy stood clinging to his nurse's skirts with one hand and to\nhis father's finger with the other, and nodded his head at them gravely\nlike a toy mandarin.\n\nThen the King had addressed them in a dignified, earnest, and almost\neloquent speech, and had promised much and prophesied the best of\nfortunes, and then, at the last, had turned suddenly toward Miss\nCarson, where she stood in the background between her mother and Father\nPaul.\n\n\"Every cause has its Joan of Arc, or its Maria Theresa,\" he cried,\nlooking steadfastly at Miss Carson.  \"No cause has succeeded without\nsome good woman to aid it.  To help us, my friends, we have a daughter\nof the people, as was Joan of Arc, and a queen, as was Maria Theresa,\nfor she comes from that country where every woman is a queen in her own\nright, and where the love of liberty is inherent.\"  The King took a\nquick step backward, and taking Miss Carson's hand drew her forward\nbeside him and placed her facing his audience, while the girl made vain\nefforts to withdraw her hand.  \"This is she,\" he said earnestly, \"the\ntrue daughter of the Church who has made it possible for us to return\nto our own again.  It is due to her that the King of Messina shall sit\nonce more on his throne; it is through her generosity alone that the\nchurches will rise from their ruins and that you will once again hear\nthe Angelus ring across the fields at sunset.  Remember her, my friends\nand cousins, pray for her as a saint upon earth, and fight gloriously\nto help her to success!\"\n\nGordon had restrained himself with difficulty while this scene was\nbeing enacted; he could not bear the thought of the King touching the\ngirl's hand.  He struggled to prevent himself from crying out at the\nfalse position into which he had dragged her; and yet there was\nsomething so admirably sincere in the King's words, something so\ncourteous and manly, that it robbed his words of all the theatrical\neffect they held, and his tribute to the girl filled even Gordon with\nan emotion which on the part of the young nobles found expression in\ncheer upon cheer.\n\nGordon recalled these cheers and the looks of wondering admiration\nwhich had been turned upon Miss Carson, and he grew so hot at the\nrecollection that he struck the wall beside him savagely with his\nclinched fist, and damned the obstinacy of his young and beautiful\nfriend with a sincerity and vigor that was the highest expression of\nhis interest in her behalf.\n\nHe threw his cigar into the rampart at his feet and dropped back into\nthe high road.  It was deserted at the time, except for the presence of\na tall, slightly built stranger, who advanced toward him from the city\ngates.  The man was dressed in garments of European fashion and carried\nhimself like a soldier, and Gordon put him down at a glance as one of\nthe volunteers from Paris.  The stranger was walking leisurely,\nstopping to gaze at the feluccas in the bay, and then turning to look\nup at the fortress on the hill.  He seemed to have no purpose in his\nwalk except the interest of a tourist, and as he drew up even with\nGordon he raised his helmet politely and, greeting him in English,\nasked if he were on the right road to the Bashaw's Palace.  Gordon\npointed to where the white walls of the palace rose above the other\nwhite walls about it.\n\n\"That is it,\" he said.  \"All the roads lead to it.  You keep going up\nhill.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the stranger.  \"I see I have taken a long way.\"  He\nput his white umbrella in the sand, and, removing his helmet, mopped\nhis forehead with his handkerchief.  \"It is a curious old town,\nTangier,\" he said, affably, \"but too many hills, is it not so?  Algiers\nI like better.  There is more life.\"\n\n\"Yes, Algiers is almost as good as the boulevards,\" Gordon assented,\n\"if you like the boulevards.  I prefer this place because it is\nunspoiled.  But, as you say, there is not much to do here.\"\n\nThe stranger's eyes fell upon the Hotel Grande Bretagne, which stood a\nquarter of a mile away from them on the beach.\n\n\"That is the Hotel Bretagne, is it not?\" he asked.  Gordon answered him\nwith a nod.\n\n\"The King Louis of Messina, so the chasseur at the hotel tells me, is\nstopping there en suite,\" the stranger added, with an interrogative air\nof one who volunteers an interesting fact, and who asks if it is true\nat the same moment.\n\n\"I can't say, I'm sure,\" Gordon replied.  \"I only arrived here\nyesterday.\"\n\nThe stranger bowed his head in recognition of this piece of personal\ninformation, and, putting on his helmet, picked up his umbrella as\nthough to continue his stroll.  As he did so his eyes wandered over the\nharbor and were arrested with apparent interest by the yacht, which lay\na conspicuous object on the blue water.  He pointed at it with his\numbrella.\n\n\"One of your English men-of-war is in the harbor, I see.  She is very\npretty, but not large; not so large as many,\" he said.\n\nGordon turned his head obligingly and gazed at the yacht with polite\ninterest.  \"Is that a man-of-war?  I thought it was a yacht,\" he said.\n\"I'm not familiar with the English war-vessels.  I am an American.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\" commented the affable stranger.  \"I am French myself, but\nI think she is a man-of-war.  I saw her guns when I passed on the\nsteamer from Gibraltar.\"\n\nGordon knew that the steamer did not pass within half a mile of where\nthe yacht lay at anchor, but he considered it might be possible to see\nher decks with the aid of a glass.\n\n\"You may be right,\" he answered, indifferently.  As he turned his eyes\nfrom the boat he saw a woman, dressed in white, and carrying a parasol,\nleave the gardens of the Hotel Bretagne, and come toward them along the\nbeach.  The Frenchman, following the direction of his eyes, saw her\nalso, and regarded her instantly with such evident concern that Gordon,\nwho had recognized her even at that distance as the Countess Zara, felt\nassured that his inquisitor held, as he had already suspected, more\nthan a tourist's interest in Tangier.\n\n\"Well, I will wish you a good-morning,\" said the Frenchman, hurriedly.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" Gordon replied, and taking a cigar from his case, he\nseated himself again upon the rampart.  As he walked away the stranger\nglanced back over his shoulder, but Gordon was apparently absorbed in\nwatching the waves below him, and had lost all interest in his chance\nacquaintance.  But he watched both the woman and the Frenchman as they\nadvanced slowly from opposite directions and drew nearer together, and\nhe was not altogether surprised, when the in man was within twenty feet\nof her, to see her start and stand still, and then, with the indecision\nof a hunted animal, move uncertainly, and then turn and run in the\ndirection of the hotel.  Something the man apparently called after her\ncaused her to stop, and Gordon observed them now with undisguised\ninterest as they stood conversing together, oblivious of the\nconspicuous mark they made on the broad white beach under the brilliant\nsun.\n\n\"I wonder what he's up to now?\" Gordon mused.  \"He was trying to pump\nme, that's evident, and he certainly recognized the lady, and she\napparently did not want to recognize him.  I wonder if he is a rejected\nlover, or another conspirator.  This is a most amusing place, nothing\nbut plots and counterplots and--Hello!\" he exclaimed aloud.  The man\nhad moved quickly past Madame Zara, and had started toward the hotel,\nand Zara had held out her hand to him, as though to entreat him to\nremain.  But he did not stop, and she had taken a few uncertain steps\nafter him, and had then, much to the American's dismay, fallen limply\non her back on the soft sand.  She was not a hundred yards distant from\nwhere he sat, and in an instant he had slipped from the wall, and\ndropped on his hands and knees on the beach below.  When Gordon reached\nher the Frenchman had returned, and was supporting her head on his knee\nand covering her head with her parasol.\n\n\"The lady has fainted!\" he exclaimed, eagerly.  His manner was no\nlonger one of idle indolence.  He was wide awake now and visibly\nexcited.\n\n\"The sun has been too much for her,\" he said.  \"It is most dangerous\nwalking about at this time of day.\"\n\nGordon ran down the beach and scooped up some water in his helmet, and\ndipping his handkerchief in it bathed her temples and cheek.  He had\ntime to note that she was a very beautiful girl, and the pallor of her\nface gave it a touch of gentleness that he had not seen there before.\n\n\"I will go to the hotel and bring assistance, said the stranger,\nuneasily, as the woman showed signs of regaining consciousness.\n\n\"No,\" said Gordon, \"you'll stay where you are and shade her with her\numbrella.  She'll be all right in a minute.\"\n\nThe girl opened her eyes, and looking up saw Gordon bending over her.\nShe regarded him for a moment and made an effort to rise, and in her\nendeavor to do so her eyes met those of the Frenchman, and with a sharp\nmoan she shut them again and threw herself from Gordon's knee to the\nsand.\n\n\"Give me that umbrella,\" said Gordon, \"and go stand over there out of\nthe way.\"\n\nThe man rose from his knee without showing any resentment and walked\nsome little distance away, where he stood with his arms folded, looking\nout to sea.  He seemed much too occupied with something of personal\ninterest to concern himself with a woman's fainting-spell.  The girl\nlifted herself slowly to her elbow, and then, before Gordon could\nassist her, rose with a quick, graceful movement and stood erect upon\nher feet.  She placed a detaining hand for an instant on the American's\narm.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" she said.  \"I am afraid I have been imprudent in\ngoing out into the sun.\"  Her eyes were fixed upon the Frenchman, who\nstood moodily staring at the sea and tearing one of his finger-nails\nwith his teeth.  He seemed utterly oblivious of their presence.  The\ngirl held out her hand for the parasol she had dropped and took it from\nGordon with a bow.\n\n\"May I walk back with you to your hotel?\" he asked.  \"Unless this\ngentleman----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the girl said, in tones which the Frenchman could have\neasily overheard had he been listening.  \"I am quite able to go alone\nnow; it is only a step.\"\n\nShe was still regarding the Frenchman closely; but as he was obviously\nunconscious of them she moved so that Gordon hid her from him, and in\nan entirely different voice she said, speaking rapidly,--\n\n\"You are Mr. Gordon, the American who joined us last night.  That man\nis a spy from Messina.  He is Renauld, the Commander-in-Chief of their\narmy.  He must be gotten away from here at once.  It is a matter for a\nman to attend to.  Will you do it?\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\" Gordon asked.  \"How do you know he is General\nRenauld?  I want to be certain.\"\n\nThe girl tossed her head impatiently.\n\n\"He was pointed out to me at Messina.  I saw him there in command at a\nreview.  He has just spoken to me--that was what frightened me into\nthat fainting-spell.  I didn't think I was so weak,\" she said, shaking\nher head.  \"He offered me a bribe to inform him of our plans.  I tell\nyou he is a spy.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Gordon, reassuringly; \"you go back to the\nhotel now and send those guards here on a run.  I'll make a charge\nagainst him and have him locked up until after we sail to-night.\nHurry, please; I'll stay here.\"\n\nGordon felt a pleasurable glow of excitement.  It was his nature to\nthrow himself into everything he did and to at once become a partisan.\nIt was a quality which made his writings attractive to the reader, and\nan object of concern to his editor.  At the very word \"spy,\" and at\nthis first hint of opposition to the cause in which he had but just\nenlisted, he thrilled as though it had always been his own, and he\nregarded the Frenchman with a personal dislike as sudden as it was\nunfounded.\n\nThe Frenchman had turned and was walking in the direction of the city\ngate.  His eyes were bent on the sandy beach which stretched before\nhim, and he made his way utterly unmindful of the waves that stole up\nto his feet and left little pools of water in his path.  Gordon\nbeckoned impatiently to the two soldiers who came running toward him at\nthe hotel, and moved forward to meet them the sooner.  He took one of\nthem by the wrist and pointed with his other hand at the retreating\nfigure of the Frenchman.\n\n\"That man,\" he said, \"is one of the King's enemies.  The King is in\ndanger while that man is here.  Your duty is to protect the King, so he\ngives this foreigner into your charge.\"\n\nThe soldier nodded his head in assent.  \"The King himself sent us,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"You will place him in the Civil Prison,\" Gordon continued, \"until the\nKing is safe on his yacht, and you will not allow him to send for the\nFrench Consul-General.  If he sees the Consul-General he will tell him\na great many lies about you, and a great war-ship will come and your\nBashaw will be forced to pay the foreigners much money.  I will go with\nyou and tell this man in his own tongue what you are going to do with\nhim.\"\n\nThey walked hurriedly after the Frenchman, and when they had overtaken\nhim Gordon halted and bowed.\n\n\"One moment, please,\" he said.  \"These soldiers have an order for your\narrest.  I speak the language, and if you have anything to say to them\nI will interpret for you.\"\n\nThe Frenchman stared from Gordon to the guards and then laughed\nincredulously but with no great confidence.  He had much to say, but he\ndemanded to know first why he should be arrested.\n\n\"The lady you insulted,\" Gordon answered, gravely, \"happened,\nunfortunately for you, to be one of the King's guests.  She has\ncomplained to him, and he has sent these soldiers to put you where you\ncannot trouble her again.  You see, sir, you cannot annoy women with\nimpunity even in this barbarous country.\"\n\n\"Insult her!  I did not insult her,\" the man retorted.  \"That is not\nthe reason I am arrested.\"\n\n\"You annoyed her so much that she fainted.  I saw you,\" said Gordon,\nbacking away with the evident purpose of abandoning the foreigner to\nhis guards.\n\n\"She has lied,\" the man cried, \"either to the King or to me.  I do not\nknow which, but I am here to find out.  That is why I came to Tangier,\nand I intend to learn the truth.\"\n\n\"You've begun rather badly,\" Gordon answered, as he still retreated.\n\"In the Civil Prison your field of investigation will be limited.\"\n\nThe Frenchman took a hasty step toward him, shrugging off the hand one\nof the soldiers had placed on his shoulder.\n\n\"Are you the Prince Kalonay, sir?\" he demanded.  \"But surely not,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"No, I am not the Prince,\" Gordon answered.  \"I bid you good-morning,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Then you are on the other side,\" the man called after him eagerly,\nwith a tone of great relief.  \"I have been right from the very first.\nI see it plainly.  It is a double plot, and you are one of that woman's\ndupes.  Listen to me--I beg of you, listen to me--I have a story to\ntell.\"\n\nGordon paused and looked back at the man over his shoulder, doubtfully.\n\n\"It's like the Arabian Nights,\" he said, with a puzzled smile.  \"There\nwas once a rich merchant of Bagdad and the Sultan was going to execute\nhim, but they put off the execution until he could tell them the story\nof the Beautiful Countess and the French Envoy.  I am sorry,\" he added,\nshaking his head, \"but I cannot listen now.  I must not be seen talking\nto you at all, and everyone can see us here.\"\n\nThey were as conspicuous figures on the flat surface of the beach as\ntwo palms in a desert, and Gordon was most anxious to escape, for he\nwas conscious that he could be observed from every point in the town.\nA hundred yards away, on the terrace of the hotel, he saw the King,\nMadame Zara, Barrat, and Erhaupt standing together watching them.\n\n\"If the American leaves him now, we are safe,\" the King was saying.  He\nspoke in a whisper, as though he feared that even at that distance\nGordon and the Frenchman could overhear his words.  \"But if he remains\nwith him he will find out the truth, and that means ruin.  He will ruin\nus.\"\n\n\"Look, he is coming this way,\" Zara answered.  \"He is leaving him.  The\ndanger is past.\"\n\nThe Frenchman raised his eyes and saw the four figures grouped closely\ntogether on the terrace.\n\n\"See, what did I tell you?\" he cried.  \"She is with the King now.  It\nis a plot within a plot, and I believe you know it,\" he added,\nfuriously.  \"You are one of these brave blackmailers yourself--that is\nwhy you will not let me speak.\"\n\n\"Blackmailers!\"  said  Gordon.  \"Confound your impudence, what the\ndevil do you mean by that?\"\n\nBut the Frenchman was staring angrily at the distant group on the\nterrace, and Gordon turned his eyes in the same direction.  Something\nhe saw in the strained and eager attitude of the four conspirators\nmoved him to a sudden determination.\n\n\"That will do, you must go,\" he commanded, pointing with his arm toward\nthe city gate; and before the Frenchman could reply, he gave an order\nto the guards, and they seized the foreigner roughly by either arm and\nhurried him away.\n\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed the King, piously.  \"They have separated, and\nthe boy thinks he is rendering us great service.  Well, and so he is,\nthe young fool.\"\n\nThe group on the piazza remained motionless, watching Gordon as he\nleisurely lit a cigar and stood looking out at the harbor until the\nFrenchman had disappeared inside the city wall.  Then he turned and\nwalked slowly after him.\n\n\"I do not like that.  I do not like his following him,\" said Barrat,\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"That is nothing,\" answered the King.  \"He is going to play the spy and\nsee that the man is safely in jail.  Then he will return and report to\nus.  We must congratulate him warmly.  He follows at a discreet\ndistance, you observe, and keeps himself well out of sight.  The boy\nknows better than to compromise himself by being seen in conversation\nwith the man.  Of course, if Renauld is set free we must say we had no\npart in his arrest, that the American made the arrest on his own\nauthority.  What a convenient tool the young man is.  Why, his coming\nreally frightened us at first, and now--now we make a cat's-paw of\nhim.\" The King laughed merrily.  \"We undervalue ourselves sometimes, do\nwe not?\"\n\n\"He is a nice boy,\" said Zara.  \"I feel rather sorry for him.  He\nlooked so anxious and distressed when I was so silly as to faint on the\nbeach just now.  He handled me as tenderly as a woman would have\ndone--not that women have generally handled me tenderly,\" she added.\n\n\"I was thinking the simile was rather misplaced,\" said the King.\n\n\nGordon passed the city wall and heard the gates swing to behind him.\nThe Frenchman and his two captors were just ahead, toiling heavily up\nthe steep and narrow street.  Gordon threw his cigar from him and ran\nleaping over the huge cobbles to the Frenchman's side and touched him\non the shoulder.\n\n\"We are out of sight of the hotel, now, General,\" he said.  He pointed\nto the dark, cool recesses of a coffee-shop and held back the rug that\nhung before it.  \"Come in here,\" he said, \"and tell me that story.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBaron Barrat was suspicious by education--his experience of life and\nhis own conduct had tended to render him so; and accordingly when,\nthree hours after he had seen Gordon apparently commit the French\nofficer to jail, he found them leaving a cafe in the most friendly and\namicable spirit, he wasted no time in investigation, but hurried at\nonce to warn the King.\n\n\"What we feared would happen, has happened,\" he said.  \"The Frenchman\nhas told Gordon that Zara and Kalonay sold the secret of the\nexpedition, and Gordon will be coming here to warn you of it.  Now,\nwhat are you going to do?  We must act quickly.\"\n\n\"I shall refuse to believe the Frenchman, of course,\" said the King.\n\"I shall ask Zara in his presence to answer his charges, and she will\ntell him he lies.  That is all there will be of it.  What does it\nmatter what he says?  We sail at midnight.  We can keep him quiet until\nthen.\"\n\n\"If he is troublesome I can call for help from this room, and the\nservants of the hotel and the guards will rush in and find us\nstruggling together.  We will charge him with an attempt at\nassassination, and this time he surely will go to jail.  By to-morrow\nmorning we shall be many miles at sea.\"\n\n\"But he can cable to Messina, by way of Gibraltar, and head us off,\"\nobjected Barrat.\n\n\"What can he cable?\" demanded the King.  \"Nothing the people of the\nRepublic do not already know.  It is our friends here that must not\nfind us out.  That is the main thing.  Thank Heaven!\" he exclaimed,\n\"Kalonay and Paul are out of the way, and those crazy boys from Paris.\nWe will settle it here among ourselves in five minutes.\"\n\n\"And the American?\" asked Zara.  \"He knows, he will come with him.\nSuppose he believes, suppose he believes that Kalonay and I have sold\nyou out, but suspects that you know it?\"\n\n\"The American can go to the devil,\" said the King.  \"Confound him and\nhis insolence.  I'll have him in the prison too, if he interferes.  Or\nErhaupt can pick a quarrel with him here and fight it out behind the\nsand-hills before the others get back from their picnic.  He has done\nas much for me before.\"\n\nZara stood up.  She was trembling slightly, and she glanced fearfully\nfrom Erhaupt to the King.\n\n\"You will not do that,\" she said.\n\n\"And why not, madame?\" demanded Louis.\n\n\"Because it will be murder,\" Zara whispered.  \"He will murder him as he\ndid that boy in the Park at Pesth.\"\n\n\"What does the woman mean?\" growled the German.  \"Is she mad?  Send her\nto her room, Louis.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean,\" Zara answered, her voice rising, in her\nexcitement.  \"You fired before they gave the word.  I know you did.\nOh, Louis,\" she cried, \"you never warned me it might come to this.  I\nam afraid.  I am afraid to meet that man----\"\n\nShe gave a sudden cry.  \"And Kalonay!\"  She held out her hands\nappealingly.  \"Indeed,\" she cried, \"do not let Kalonay question me.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" commanded the King.  \"You are acting like a fool.\" He\nadvanced toward her, and clasped her wrist firmly in his hand.  \"No\nnerves, now,\" he said.  \"I'll not have it.  You shall meet Kalonay, and\nyou shall swear that he is in the plot against me.  If you fail us now,\nwe are ruined.  As it is, we are sure to lose the bribe from the\nRepublic, but we may still get Miss Carson's money if you play your\npart.  It is your word and the word of the Frenchman against Kalonay's.\nAnd we have the paper signed by you for Kalonay as evidence.  Have you\ngot it with you?\"\n\nZara bowed her head.  \"It is always with me,\" she answered.\n\n\"Good,\" said the King.  \"It will be a difficult chance, but if you\nstand to your story, and we pretend to believe you, the others may\nbelieve you, too.\"\n\n\"But I cannot,\" Zara cried.  \"I know I cannot.  I tell you if you put\nme face to face with Kalonay, I shall fail you.  I shall break down.\nThey will see that I am lying.  Send me away.  Send me away before they\ncome.  Tell them I saw the Frenchman, and suspected I had been found\nout, and that I have gone away.  Tell them you don't know where I am.\"\n\n\"I believe she's right,\" Erhaupt said.  \"She will do us more harm than\ngood.  Let her go to her room and wait there.\"\n\n\"She will remain where she is,\" said the King, sternly.  \"And she will\nkeep her courage and her wits about her, or----\"\n\nHe was interrupted by an exclamation from Barrat.  \"Whatever you mean\nto do, you must do it at once,\" he said, grimly.  He was standing at\nthe window which overlooked the beach.  \"Here they come now,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The American has taken no chances, he is bringing an\naudience with him.\"\n\nThe King and Erhaupt ran to the window, and peered over Barrat's\nshoulder.\n\nAdvancing toward them along the beach, some on foot, and some on\nhorseback, were all the members of the expedition, those who had been\nof the riding-party and those who had remained in Tangier.  Gordon and\nthe Frenchman Renauld were far in the lead, walking by themselves and\nspeaking earnestly together; Father Paul was walking with Mrs. Carson\nand her daughter, and Kalonay was riding with two of the volunteers,\nthe Count de Rouen and Prince Henri of Poitiers.\n\nWhen the King and Erhaupt turned from the window the Countess Zara had\ndisappeared.  \"It is better so,\" said Erhaupt; \"she was so badly\nfrightened she would have told the truth.\"\n\nThe King stood leaning on the back of a large arm-chair.  \"Well, the\nmoment has come, it is our last chance,\" he said.  \"Send for the Crown\nPrince, Baron.  I shall be discovered in the act of taking a tender\nfarewell of my son.\"\n\nBarrat made an eager gesture of dissent.\n\n\"I would not do that,\" he cried.  \"If we are to make charges against\nthe jackal do not have the boy present; the boy must not hear them.\nYou know how Kalonay worships the child, and it would enrage him more\nto be exposed before the Prince than before all the rest of the world.\nHe will be hard enough to handle without that.  Don't try him too far.\"\n\n\"You are absurd, Barrat,\" exclaimed the King.  \"The boy won't\nunderstand what is said.\"\n\n\"No, but the Jackal will,\" Barrat returned.  \"You don't understand him,\nLouis, he is like a woman; he has sentiment and feelings, and when we\nall turn on him he will act like a madman.  Keep the boy out of his\nsight, I tell you.  It's the only thing he cares for in the world.  He\nhas been a better father to him than you ever have been.\"\n\n\"That was quite natural; that was because it was his duty,\" said the\nKing, calmly.  \"A Kalonay has always been the protector and tutor of\nthe heir-apparent.  If this one chooses to give his heart with his\nservice, that is not my concern.  Why, confound them, they all think\nmore of the child than they do of me.  That is why I need him by me\nnow.\"\n\nBarrat shook his head.  \"I tell you it will make trouble,\" he\npersisted.  \"Kalonay will not stand it. He and the child are more like\ncomrades than a tutor and his pupil.  Why, Kalonay would rather sit\nwith the boy in the Champs-Elysees and point out the people as they go\nby than drive at the side of the prettiest woman in Paris.  He always\ntreats him as though he saw the invisible crown upon his head; he will\nthrow over any of us to stay in the nursery and play tin soldiers with\nhim.  And when he was ill--\" Barrat nodded his head significantly.\n\"You remember.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the King.  \"We have no time to consider the finer\nfeelings of the jackal; he is to be sacrificed, and that is all there\nis of it.  The presence of the child may make him more unmanageable,\nbut it will certainly make it easier for me.  So go, bring the boy here\nas I bid you.\"\n\nBarrat left the room and returned immediately, followed by the Crown\nPrince and his nurse.  The Prince was a dark, handsome little fellow of\nfour years.  His mother had died when he was born, and he had never\nplayed with children of his own age, and his face was absurdly wise and\nwistful; but it lighted with a sweet and grateful smile when anyone\nshowed him kindness or sought to arouse his interest.  To the Crown\nPrince Kalonay was an awful and wonderful being.  He was the one person\nwho could make him laugh out of pure happiness and for no reason, as a\nchild should laugh.  And people who had seen them together asked which\nof the princes was the older of the two.  When the child entered the\nroom, clinging to Barrat's finger, he carried in his other hand a\nwooden spade and bucket, still damp with sand, and he was dressed in a\nshabby blue sailor suit which left his little legs bare, and exposed\nthe scratches and bruises of many falls.  A few moments later, when the\nconspirators entered the King's salon, preceded by Erhaupt, they found\nthe boy standing by his father's knee.  The King had his hand upon the\nchild's head, and had been interrupted apparently in a discourse on the\ndignity of kingship, for the royal crown of Messina had been brought\nout and stood beside him on the table, and his other hand rested on it\nreverently.  It was an effective tableau, and the visitors observed it\nwith varying emotions, but with silence.\n\nThe King rose, taking his son's hand in his, and bowed, looking\ninquiringly from Barrat to the Prince Kalonay.\n\n\"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?\" he asked.  \"Was it\ndiscreet of you to come together in this way?  But you are most\nwelcome.  Place chairs for the ladies, Barrat.\"\n\nKalonay glanced at the others, and they nodded to him as though to make\nhim their spokesman.  He pointed at Gordon with his cap.\n\n\"We are here on the invitation of this gentleman, your Majesty,\" he\nsaid.  \"He took it upon himself to send after those of us who had gone\ninto the country, and came in person for the others who remained in\ntown.  He tells us he has news of the greatest importance to\ncommunicate, which he cannot disclose except to you, and in the\npresence of all of those who are to take part in the expedition.  We\ndecided to accompany him here, as he asked us, and to leave it to your\nMajesty to say whether or not you wished us to remain.\" Kalonay smiled\nin apology at the King, and the King answered him with a smile.\n\n\"The procedure is perhaps unconventional,\" the King said, \"but in\nAmerica they move quickly.  No doubt our young companion has acted as\nhe thought was for the best.  If he has taken a liberty, the nature of\nhis news will probably excuse him.  Perhaps, Mr. Gordon,\" he added,\nturning to the American, \"you had better first tell me what this\ndiscovery is, and I will decide whether it is best to discuss it in\nopen council.\"\n\nGordon did not appear to be the least disturbed by the criticism\nKalonay and the King had passed upon his conduct.  He only smiled\npleasantly when the King had finished speaking, and showed no\ninclination to accept a private audience.\n\n\"What I have to say, your Majesty,\" he began, \"is this.  I have learned\nthat all the secrets of your expedition have been sold to the Republic\nof Messina.  One of those now present in this room is charged with\nhaving sold them.  Shall I go on,\" he asked, \"or do you still think it\nadvisable for anyone to leave the room?\"\n\nHe paused and glanced from the King to the double row of conspirators,\nwho were standing together in a close semicircle facing the King and\nhimself.  The instant he ceased speaking there rose from their ranks an\noutburst of consternation, of anger, and of indignant denial.  The\nKing's spirits rose within him at the sound, although he frowned and\nmade a gesture as though to command silence.\n\n\"Mr. Gordon, this is a serious charge you make,\" he said, smiling\ngrimly.  \"One that may cost you a great deal--it might cost you your\nlife perhaps.\"  He paused significantly, and there was a second\noutburst, this time from the younger men, which came so suddenly that\nit was as though Louis had played upon certain chords on a keyboard,\nand the sounds he wanted had answered to his touch.\n\n\"Pardon me, that is not the question,\" said Gordon.  \"That I make\ncharges or run risks in making charges is not important.  That your\nexpedition has failed before it has even started is, however, of great\nimportance, at least so it sees to me.\"\n\nThere was a movement in the circle, and Father Paul pushed his way\nforward from his place beside Miss Carson's chair.  He was so greatly\nmoved that when he spoke his voice was harsh and broken.  \"What is your\nauthority for saying we have failed?\" he demanded.\n\nGordon bowed gravely and turned and pointed to the Frenchman.  \"This\ngentleman,\" he said, \"is General Renauld, Commander-in-Chief of the\narmy of Messina.  He is my authority.  He knows all that you mean to\ndo.  If he knows it, it is likely, is it not, that his army and the\nPresident of the Republic know it also, and that when we attempt to\nland they will be waiting for us.\"\n\nThe King silenced the second outburst that followed this by rising and\nholding up his hand.\n\n\"Silence!  I believe I can explain,\" he said.  He was smiling, and his\nbearing was easy and so full of assurance that the exclamations and\nwhispers died away on the instant.  \"I am afraid I see what has\nhappened,\" the King said.  \"But there need be no cause for alarm.  This\ngentleman is, as Mr. Gordon says, the Commander-in-Chief of the\nMessinian army, and it is true he suspected that an armed force would\ninvade the island.  It is not strange that he should have suspected it,\nand it needed no traitor to enlighten him.  The visit of Father Paul\nand the Prince Kalonay in the yacht, and their speeches inciting the\npeople to rebellion, would have warned the government that an\nexpedition might soon follow.  The return of our yacht to this place\nhas no doubt been made known in Messina through the public press, and\nGeneral Renauld followed the yacht here to learn what he could of our\nplans--of our intended movements.  He came here to spy on us, and as a\nspy I ordered Mr. Gordon to arrest him this morning on any charge he\npleased, and to place him out of our way until after to-night, when we\nshould have sailed.  I chose Mr. Gordon to undertake this service\nbecause he happened to speak the language of the country, and it was\nnecessary to deal directly with the local authorities without the\nintervention of an outsider.  What has happened is only too evident.\nThe spy, who when he came here only suspected, now, as Mr. Gordon says,\nknows the truth, and he could have learned it only from one person, to\nwhom he has no doubt paid a pretty price for the information.\"  The\nKing took a step forward and pointed with his hand at the American.  \"I\ngave that man into your keeping, sir,\" he cried, \"but I had you\nwatched.  Instead of placing him in jail you took him to a cafe and\nremained there with him for three hours, and from that cafe you came\ndirectly here to this room.  If he knows the truth, he learned it in\nthat cafe, and he learned it from you!\"  There was a ring of such\nearnestness and sincerity in the King's speech, and he delivered it\nwith such indignation and bitter contempt that a shout of relief, of\napprobation and conviction, went up from his hearers, and fell as\nquickly on the words as the applause of an audience drowns out the last\nnote of a great burst of song.  Barrat, in the excess of his relief,\nturned his back sharply on the King, glancing sideways at Erhaupt and\nshaking his head in speechless admiration.\n\n\"He is wonderful, simply wonderful,\" Erhaupt muttered; \"he would have\nmade a great actor or a great diplomat.\"\n\n\"He is wasted as a King,\" whispered Barrat.\n\nThere was a menacing movement on the part of the younger men toward\nGordon and General Renauld, which the King noted, but which he made no\neffort to check.  Neither Gordon nor General Renauld gave any sign that\nthey observed it. The American was busily engaged in searching his\npockets, and from one of these he produced two pieces of paper, which\nhe held up above his head, so that those in the room might see them.\n\n\"One moment, please,\" he began, and then waited until the tumult in the\nroom had ceased.  \"Again, I must point out to you,\" he said, in brisk,\nbusiness-like tones, \"that we are digressing.  The important thing is\nnot who did, or did not, sell out the expedition, but that it is in\ndanger of failing altogether.  What his Majesty says is in part\ncorrect.  I did not take this gentleman to jail; I did take him to a\ncafe, and there he told me much more concerning the expedition than I\nhad learned from those directly interested.  His information, he told\nme, had been sold to the Republic by one who visited the island and who\nclaimed to act for one other.  I appreciated the importance of what he\nsaid, and I also guessed that my word and his unsupported might be\ndoubted, as you have just doubted it.  So I took the liberty of\nverifying what General Renauld told me by cabling to the President of\nMessina.\"\n\nThere was a shout of consternation at these words, but Gordon's manner\nwas so confident and the audacity of his admission so surprised his\nhearers that they were silent again immediately, and waited, with\nbreathless interest, while Gordon unfolded one of the pieces of paper.\n\n\"This is a copy of the cablegram I sent the President,\" he said, \"and\nto which, with his permission, I signed General Renauld's name.  It is\nas follows:--\n\n\nThe President.  The Palace, Messina.--They will not believe you are\nfully informed.  Cable at once the exact hour when they will leave\nTangier, at what hour they expect to land, at what place they expect to\nland, what sum you have promised to pay for this information, and the\nnames of those to whom it is to be paid.\n\nRENAULD.\n\n\nGordon lowered the paper.  \"Is that quite clear?\" he asked.  \"Do you\nfollow me? I have invited the enemy himself to inform you of your\nplans, and to tell you who has betrayed them.  His answer, which was\nreceived a half hour ago, removes all suspicion from any save those he\nnames.  General Renauld and myself cease to be of the least consequence\nin the matter; we are only messengers.  It is the President of Messina\nwho will speak to you now.  If you still doubt that the secret of your\nexpedition is known to the President you will have to doubt him.\"\n\nThe King sprang quickly to his feet and struck the arm of his chair\nsharply with his open hand.\n\n\"I shall not permit that message to be read,\" he said.  \"If we have a\ntraitor here, he is a traitor against me.  And I shall deal with him as\nI see fit, in private.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of disappointment and of disapproval even, and the\nKing again struck the arm of his chair for silence.  Kalonay advanced\ntoward him, shaking his head and holding out his hands in protest.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I beseech you,\" he began.  \"This concerns us all,\" he\ncried.  \"It is too evident that we have been betrayed; but it is not\nfair to any of us that we should all lie under suspicion, as we must\nunless it is told who has been guilty of this infamy.  I beg your\nMajesty to reconsider.  There is no one in this room who is not in our\nsecret, and whoever has betrayed us must be with us here and now.  I,\nwho have an interest second only to your own, ask that that cablegram\nbe read.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approbation from the conspirators, and\nexclamations of approval and entreaty.  Miss Carson, in her excitement,\nhad risen to her feet and was standing holding her mother's hand.  The\nKing glanced uncertainly at Kalonay, and then turned to Barrat and\nErhaupt as if in doubt.\n\nGordon's eyes were fixed for a moment on Kalonay with a strange and\npuzzled expression.  Then he gave a short sigh of relief, and turning\nquickly searched the faces of those around him.  What he saw seemed to\nconfirm him in his purpose, for he folded the paper and placed it in\nhis pocket.  \"His Majesty is right,\" he said.  \"I shall not read this.\"\n\nKalonay and Father Paul turned upon him angrily.  \"You have no choice\nin the matter, sir,\" Kalonay cried.  \"It has passed entirely out of\nyour hands.\"\n\n\"I beg your Majesty that the cablegram be read,\" the priest demanded,\nin a voice that held less the tone of a request than of a command.\n\n\"I shall not read it,\" persisted Gordon, \"because the person chiefly\nconcerned is not present.\"\n\n\n\"That is all the more reason for reading it,\" said Kalonay.  \"Your\nMajesty must reconsider.\"\n\nThe King whispered to Barrat, and the others waited in silence that\nexpressed their interest more clearly than a chorus of questions would\nhave done.\n\n\"It shall be as you ask,\" the King said, at last.  \"You may read the\nmessage, Mr. Gordon.\"\n\nGordon opened the paper and looked at it for some seconds of time with\na grave and perplexed expression, and then, with a short breath, as one\nwho takes a plunge, read it aloud.  \"This is it,\" he said.\n\n\nTo General Renauld.  Cable Office, Tangier.--They leave Tangier Tuesday\nat midnight, they land at daybreak Thursday morning on the south beach\nbelow the old breakwater.  The secret of the expedition was sold us for\nthree hundred thousand francs by the Countess Zara and the Prince\nKalonay.\n\n\nGordon stuck the paper in his pocket, and, crossing to Kalonay, held\nout his hand, with a smile.  \"I don't believe it, of course,\" he said;\n\"but you would have it.\"\n\nKalonay neither saw the gesture nor heard the words.  He was turning in\nbewilderment from the King to Father Paul, and he laughed uncertainly.\n\n\"What nonsense is this?\" he demanded.  \"Whose sorry trick is this?  The\nlie is not even ingenious.\"\n\nGeneral Renauld had not spoken since he had entered the room, but now\nhe advanced in front of Kalonay and faced him with a threatening\ngesture.\n\n\"The President of Messina does not lie, sir,\" he said, sternly.  \"I\nmyself saw the Countess Zara write out that paper, which I and others\nsigned, and in which we agreed to pay to her and to you the money you\nasked for betraying your King.\"\n\nFather Paul pressed his hand heavily on Kalonay's shoulder.  \"Do not\nanswer him,\" he commanded.  Gordon had moved to Kalonay's other side,\nand the three men had unconsciously assumed an attitude of defence, and\nstood back to back in a little group facing the angry circle that\nencompassed them.  The priest raised his arm to command a hearing.\n\n\"Where is Madame Zara?\" he cried.\n\n\"Ah, where indeed?\" echoed the King, sinking back into his chair.  \"She\nhas fled.  It is all too evident now; she has betrayed us and she has\nfled.\"\n\nBut on his words, as if in answer to the priest's summons, the curtains\nthat hid the door into the King's private room were pulled to one side,\nand Madame Zara appeared between them, glancing fearfully at the\nexcited crowd before her.  As she stood hesitating on the threshold,\nshe swayed slightly and clutched the curtains for a moment as though\nfor support.  The priest advanced, and led her to the centre of the\nroom.  She held a folded paper in her hand, which she gave to him in\nsilence.\n\n\"You have heard what has passed?\" he asked, with a toss of his head\ntoward the heavy curtains.  The woman raised her head and bowed.  The\npriest unfolded the paper.\n\n\"Am I to read this?\" he asked.  The woman bowed again.\n\nThere was silence in the room while the priest's eyes ran quickly over\nthe paper.  He crushed it in his hand.\n\n\"It is as General Renauld says,\" he exclaimed.  \"In this the Republic\nof Messina agrees to pay the Countess Zara and the Prince Kalonay three\nhundred thousand francs, if the expedition is withdrawn after it has\nmade a pretence of landing on the shores of Messina.\"\n\nHe took a step forward.  \"Madame Zara,\" he cried, in a tone of warning,\n\"do you pretend that the Prince Kalonay was your accomplice in this;\nthat he knew what you meant to do?\"\n\nMadame Zara once more bowed her head.\n\n\"No! You must speak,\" commanded the priest.  \"Answer me!\"\n\nZara hesitated, in evident distress, and glanced appealingly at the\nKing; but the expression on his face was one of grief and of\nunrelenting virtue.  \"I do,\" she said, at last, in a low voice.\n\"Kalonay did know.  He thought the revolution would not succeed; he\nthought it would fail, and so--and so--and we needed money.  They made\nme--I, O my God, I cannot--I cannot!\" she cried, suddenly, sinking on\nher knees and hiding her face with her hands.\n\nKalonay stepped toward her and lifted her gently to her feet; but when\nshe looked and saw who it was that held her, she gave a cry and pulled\nherself free.  She staggered and would have fallen, had not Gordon\ncaught and held her by the arm.  The King rose from his chair and\npointed at the shrinking figure of the woman.\n\n\"Stand aside from her,\" he said, sternly.  \"Why should we pity her,\nwhat pity has she shown for us--for me?  She has robbed me of my\ninheritance.  But let her go, she is a woman; we cannot punish her.\nHer sins rest on her own head.  But you--you,\" he cried, turning\nfiercely on Kalonay, his voice rising to a high and melancholy key,\n\"you whom I have heaped with honors, whom I have leaned upon as on the\narm of a brother, that you should have sold me for silver, that you\nshould have turned Judas!\"\n\nThe crowd of volunteers, bewildered by the rapid succession of events,\nand confused and rendered desperate by the failure of their expedition,\ncaught up the word, and pressing forward with a rush, surrounded\nKalonay in an angry circle, crying \"Judas!\" \"Traitor!\" and \"Coward!\"\n\nKalonay turned from side to side.  On some he smiled bitterly in\nsilence, and at others he broke out into swift and fierce\ndenunciations; but the men around him crowded closer and would not\npermit him to be heard.  He had turned upon them, again challenging\nthem to listen, when there was an opening in the circle and the men\nstepped back, and Miss Carson pushed her way among them and halted at\nKalonay's side.  She did not look at him, but at the men about him.\nShe was the only calm figure in the group, and her calmness at such a\ncrisis, and her youth, and the fineness and fearlessness of her beauty,\nsurprised them into a sudden quiet.  There was instantly a cry for\norder, and the men stood curious and puzzled, watching to see what she\nwould do.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" she said, in a clear, grave voice.  \"Gentlemen,\" she\nrepeated, sharply, as a few murmurs still greeted her, \"if you are\ngentlemen, let this lady speak.  She has not finished.\"  She crossed\nquickly and took the Countess Zara by the hand.  \"Go on, madame,\" she\nurged, gently.  \"Do not be afraid.  You say they made you do it.  Who\nmade you do it?  You have told us a part of the truth.  Now tell us the\nwhole truth.\"  For a moment the girl seemed much the older of the two,\nand as Zara glanced up at her fearfully, she smiled to reassure her,\nand stroked the woman's hand with her own.  \"Who made you do it?\" she\nrepeated.  \"Not the Prince Kalonay, surely.  You cannot hope to make us\nbelieve that.  We trust him absolutely.  Who was it, then?\"\n\nThe King sprang forward with an oath; his apathy and mock dignity had\nfallen from him like a mask.  His face was mottled, and his vicious\nlittle eyes flashed with fear and anger.  Erhaupt crowded close behind\nhim, crouching like a dog at his heels.\n\n\"She has lied enough already,\" the King cried.  \"We will not listen to\nher.  Take her away.\"\n\n\"Yes, let her go,\" shouted Erhaupt, with a laugh.  \"If she had been a\ndecent woman----\"\n\nThere was a quick parting in the group and the sound of a heavy blow as\nKalonay flung himself upon Erhaupt and struck him in the face, so that\nhe staggered and fell at length upon the floor.  Gordon stood over him,\nhis fingers twitching at his side.\n\n\"Stand up, you bully,\" he said, \"and get out of this, before we throw\nyou out.\"\n\nZara's face had turned a pitiful crimson, but her eyes flashed and\nburned with resolve and indignation.  She stood erect and menacing,\nlike an angry goddess, and more beautiful in her indignation than they\nhad ever seen her.\n\n\"Now, I shall tell them the truth,\" she said, sternly.  \"That man,\" she\ncried, pointing her finger at the King, \"that man whom they call a\nKing--that man who would have sacrificed the only friend who serves him\nunselfishly--is the man who sold your secret to the enemy.  It was he\nwho made me do it.  He sent me to Messina, and while the priest and the\nPrince Kalonay were working in the south, I sold them to the government\nat the capital.  Barrat knew it, Erhaupt knew it, the King himself\nplanned it--to get money.  He has robbed all of his own people; he had\nmeant to rob this young girl; and he is so mean and pitiful a creature\nthat to save himself he now tries to hide behind the skirts of a woman,\nand to sacrifice her,--the woman who has given her soul to him.  And\nfor this--my God!\" she cried, her voice rising in an accent of agony\nand bitter contempt--\"for this!\"\n\nThere was a grim and momentous silence in the room while Zara turned,\nand without waiting to learn what effect her words might have, made her\nway swiftly through the crowd and passed on out of the room and on to\nthe terrace beyond.\n\nThe King crouched back in his chair like a common criminal in the dock,\nglancing fearfully from under his lowered eyebrows at the faces about\nhim, and on none did he see the least question of doubt but that Zara\nhad at last spoken the truth.\n\n\"She lies,\" the King muttered, as though answering their unspoken\nthoughts, \"the woman lies.\"\n\nThere was no movement from the men about him.  Shame for him, and grief\nand bitter disappointment for themselves, showed on the face of each.\nFrom outside a sea-breeze caught up the sand of the beach and drove it\nwhispering against the high windows, and the beat of the waves upon the\nshores filled out and marked the silence of the room.\n\nThe Prince Kalonay stepped from the circle and stood for a moment\nbefore the King, regarding him with an expression of grief and bitter\nirony.  The King's eyes rose insolently, and faltered, and sank.\n\n\"For many years, your Majesty,\" the Prince said, but so solemnly that\nit was as though he were a judge upon the bench, or a priest speaking\nacross an open grave, \"the Princes of my house have served the Kings of\nyours.  In times of war they fought for the King in battle, they\nbeggared themselves for him in times of peace; our women sold their\njewels for the King, our men gave him their lives, and in all of these\ncenturies the story of their loyalty, of their devotion, has had but\none sequel, and has met with but one reward,--ingratitude and\nselfishness and treachery.  You know how I have served you, Louis.  You\nknow that I gave up my fortune and my home to go into exile with you,\nand I did that gladly.  But I did more than that.  I did more than any\nking or any man has the right to expect of any other man.  I served\nyour idle purposes so well that you, yourself, called me your jackal,\nthe only title your Majesty has ever bestowed that was deserved.  There\nis no low thing nor no base thing that I have not done for you.  To\nserve your pleasures, to gain you money, I have sunken so low that all\nthe royal blood in Europe could not make me clean.  But there is a\nlimit to what a man may do for his King, and to the loyalty a King may\nhave the right to demand.  And to-day and here, with me, the story of\nour devotion to your House ends, and you go your way and I go mine, and\nthe last of my race breaks his sword and throws it at your feet, and is\ndone with you and yours forever.\"\n\nEven those in the room who held no sympathy in their hearts for the\nsentiment that had inspired the young man, felt that at that moment and\nin their hearing he had renounced what was to him his religion and his\nfaith, and on the faces of all was the expression of a deep pity and\nconcern.  Their own adventure, in the light of his grief and bitterness\nof spirit, seemed selfish and little, and they stood motionless, in an\nawed and sorrowful silence.\n\nThe tense strain of the moment was broken suddenly by the advent on the\nscene of an actor who had, in the rush of events, been neglected and\nforgotten.  The little Crown Prince had stood clinging to his nurse's\nskirts, an uncomprehending spectator of what was going forward.  But he\nnow advanced slowly, feeling that the silence invited him to claim his\nfather's notice.  He halted beside the chair in which Louis sat, his\nhead bent on his hands, and made an effort to draw himself up to his\nfather's knee.\n\nBut the King pushed him down, and hid his face from him.  The child\nturned irresolutely, with a troubled countenance, and, looking up, saw\nthat the attention of all was fixed upon him.  At this discovery a\nsudden flood of shyness overtook him, and he retreated hastily until\nhis eyes fell on the Prince Kalonay, standing alone, with his own eyes\nturned resolutely away.  There was a breathless hush in the room as the\nchild, with a happy sigh, ran to his former friend and comrade, and\nreached up both his arms.  The tableau was a familiar one to those who\nknew them, and meant only that the child asked to be lifted up and\nswung to the man's shoulder; but following as it did on what had just\npassed, the gesture and the attitude carried with them the significance\nof an appeal.  Kalonay, as though with a great effort, lowered his eyes\nto the upturned face of the child below him, but held himself back and\nstood stiffly erect.  A sharp shake of the head, as though he argued\nwith himself, was the only sign he gave of the struggle that was going\non within him.\n\nAt this second repulse, the child's arms dropped to his side, his lips\nquivered, and he stood, a lonely little figure, glancing up at the\ncircle of men about him, and struggling to press back the tears that\ncame creeping to his eyes.\n\nKalonay regarded him steadfastly for a brief moment, as though he saw\nhim as a stranger, searching his face with eyes as pitiful as the\nchild's own; and then, with a sudden, sharp cry, the Prince dropped on\nhis knee and caught the child toward him, crushing him against his\nheart, and burying his face on his shoulder.  There was a shout of\nexultation from the nobles, and an uttered prayer from the priest, and\nin a moment the young men had crowded in around them, struggling to be\nthe first to kiss the child's hands, and to ask pardon of the man who\nheld him in his arms.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Kalonay cried, his voice laughing through his tears, \"we\nshall still sail for the island of Messina.  They shall not say of us\nthat we visited the sins of the father on a child.  I was weak, my\nfriends, and I was credulous.  I thought I could break the tradition of\ncenturies.  But our instincts are stronger than our pride, and the\nHouse I have always served I shall serve to the last.\"  He swung the\nCrown Prince high upon his shoulder, and held his other arm above his\nhead.  \"You will help me place this child upon his throne,\" he\ncommanded, and the room rang with cheers.  \"You will appeal to his\npeople,\" he cried.  \"Do you not think they will rise to this\nstandard-bearer, will they not rally to his call?  For he is a true\nPrince, my comrades, who comes to them with no stain of wrong or\ntreachery, without a taint, as untarnished as the white snow that lies\nsummer and winter in the hollow of our hills, `and a child shall lead\nus, and a child shall set them free.'  To the yacht!\" he shouted.  \"We\nwill sail at once, and while they wait for us to be betrayed into their\nhands at the north, we shall be landing in the south, and thousands\nwill be hurrying to our standard.\"\n\nHis last words were lost in a tumult of cheers and cries, and the young\nmen poured out upon the terrace, running toward the shore, and filling\nthe soft night-air with shouts of \"Long live the Prince Regent!\"  \"Long\nlive our King!\"\n\nAs the room grew empty Kalonay crossed it swiftly and advancing to Miss\nCarson took her hand.  His face was radiant with triumph and content.\nHe regarded her steadily for a moment, as though he could not find\nwords to tell his feelings.\n\n\"You had faith in me,\" he said, at last.  \"Can I ever make you\nunderstand how much that means to me?  When all had turned against me\nyou trusted me, you had faith in me, in the King's jackal.\"\n\n\"Silence; you must never say that again,\" the girl commanded, gently.\n\"You have shown it to be the lie it always was.  We shall call you the\nDefender of the Faith now; you are the guardian of a King.\"  She smiled\nat the little boy in his arms, and made a slight courtesy to them both.\n\"You have outgrown your old title,\" she said; \"you have a proud one\nnow, you will be the Prince Regent.\"\n\nKalonay, with the child in his arms, and Miss Carson were standing\nquite alone.  General Renauld had been led away, guarded by a merry\nband of youngsters; the King still crouched in his chair, with Barrat\nbowed behind him, but pulling, with philosophic calm, on a cigarette,\nand Father Paul and Gordon were in close conversation with Mrs. Carson\nat the farther end of the room.  The sun had set, and the apartment was\nin semi-darkness.  Kalonay moved closer to Miss Carson and looked\nboldly into her eyes, \"There is a prouder title than that of the\nRegent,\" he whispered; \"will you ever give it me?\"\n\nThe girl started, breathing quickly, and turned her head aside, making\nan effort to free her hand, but Kalonay held it closer in his own.\n\"Will you give it me?\" he begged.\n\nThen the girl looked up at him smiling, but with such confidence and\nlove in her eyes that he read his answer, though she shook her head, as\nthough to belie the truth her eyes had told him.\n\n\"When you have done your work,\" she said, \"come to me or send for me,\nand I shall come and give you my answer; and whether you fail or\nsucceed the answer will be the same.\"\n\nKalonay stooped quickly and kissed her hand, and when he raised his\nface his eyes were smiling with such happiness that the little child in\nhis arms read it there, and smiled too in sympathy, and pressed his\nface closer against his comrade's shoulder.\n\nGordon at this moment moved across the room and bowed, making a deep\nobeisance to the child.\n\n\"Might I be permitted,\" he asked, \"to kiss his Royal Highness?  I\nshould like to boast of the fact, later,\" he explained.\n\nThe Crown Prince turned his sad, wise eyes on him in silence, and\ngravely extended a little hand.\n\n\"You may kiss his Highness's hand,\" said Kalonay, smiling.\n\nGordon laughed and pressed the fingers in his own.\n\n\"When you talk like that, Kalonay,\" he said, \"you make me feel like\nAlice in the court-room with the Kings and Queens around her.  A dozen\ntimes this afternoon I've felt like saying, `After all, they are only a\npack of cards.'\"\n\nKalonay shook his head and glanced toward Miss Carson for enlightenment.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\n\"No, you couldn't be expected to,\" said Gordon; \"You have not been\neducated up to that.  It is the point of view.\"\n\nHe stuck out the middle finger of his hand, and drove it three times\ndeliberately into the side of the Crown Prince.  The child gasped and\nstared open-mouthed at the friendly stranger, and then catching the\nlaugh in Gordon's eyes, laughed with him.\n\n\"Now,\" said Gordon, \"I shall say that I have dug the King of Messina in\nthe ribs--that is even better than having kissed him.  God bless your\nRoyal Highness,\" he said, bowing gravely.  \"You may find me\ndisrespectful at times,\" he added; \"but then, you must remember, I am\ngoing to risk a valuable life for you.  At least it's an extremely\nvaluable one to me.\"\n\nKalonay looked at Gordon for a moment with serious consideration, and\nthen held out his hand.  \"You also had faith in me,\" he said.  \"I thank\nyou.  Are you in earnest; do you really wish to serve us?\"\n\n\"I mean to stay by you until the boy is crowned,\" said the American,\n\"unless we separate on our several paths of glory--where they will lead\ndepends, I imagine, on how we have lived.\"\n\n\"Or on how we die,\" Kalonay added.  \"I am glad to hear you speak so.\nIf you wish, I shall attach you to the person of the Crown Prince.  You\nshall be on the staff with the rank of Colonel.\"\n\nGordon made a low and sweeping bow.\n\n\"Rise, Sir Archibald Gordon,\" he said.  \"I thank you,\" he added. \"We\nshall strive to please.\"\n\nMiss Carson shook her head at him, and sighed in protest.\n\n\"Will you always take everything as a joke, Archie?\" she said.\n\n\"My dear Patty,\" he answered, \"the situation is much too serious to\ntake in any other way.\"\n\nThey moved to the door, and there the priest and Mrs. Carson joined\nthem; but on the threshold Kalonay stopped and looked for the first\ntime since he had addressed him at the King.\n\nHe regarded him for some seconds sternly in silence, and then pointed,\nwith his free hand, at the crown of Messina, which still rested on the\ntable at the King's elbow.  \"Colonel Gordon,\" he said, in a tone of\nassured authority, \"I give the crown of Messina into your keeping.  You\nwill convey it, with all proper regard for its dignity, safely on board\nthe yacht, and then bring it at once to me.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking the Prince turned and, without looking at\nthe King, passed on with the others across the terrace and disappeared\nin the direction of the shore, where the launch lay waiting.\n\nGordon crossed the room and picked up the crown from the table, lifting\nit with both hands, the King and Barrat watching him in silence as he\ndid so.  He hesitated, and held it for a moment, regarding it with much\nthe same expression of awe and amusement that a man shows when he is\npermitted to hold a strange baby in his arms.  Turning, he saw the\nsinister eyes of the King and of Barrat fastened upon him, and he\nsmiled awkwardly, and in some embarrassment turned the crown about in\nhis hands, so that the jewels in its circle gleamed dully in the dim\nlight of the room.  Gordon raised the crown and balanced it on his\nfinger-tips, regarding it severely and shaking his head.\n\n\"There are very few of these left in the world now, your Majesty,\" he\nsaid, cheerfully, \"and the number is getting smaller every year.  We\nhave none at all in my country, and I should think--seeing they are so\nfew--that those who have them would take better care of them, and try\nto keep them untarnished, and brushed up, and clean.\"  He turned his\nhead and looked inquiringly at the King, but Louis made no sign that he\nheard him.\n\n\"I have no desire, you understand me,\" continued Gordon, unabashed, \"to\ntake advantage of a man when he is down, but the temptation to say `I\ntold you so' seems almost impossible to resist.  What?\" he asked--\"I\nbeg your pardon, I thought you spoke.\"  But the King continued\nscornfully silent, and only a contemptuous snort from Barrat expressed\nhis feelings.\n\nGordon placed the crown carefully under his arm, and then removed it\nquickly, with a guilty look of dismay at its former owner, and let it\nswing from his hand; but this fashion of carrying it seemed also\nlacking in respect, so he held it up again with both hands and glanced\nat the King in some perplexity.\n\n\"There ought to be a sofa-cushion to go with this, or something to\ncarry it on,\" he said, in a grieved tone.  \"You see, I am new at this\nsort of thing.  Perhaps your Majesty would kindly give me some expert\ninformation.  How do you generally carry it?\"\n\nThe King's eyes snapped open and shut again.\n\n\"On my head,\" he said, grimly.\n\nGordon laughed in great relief.\n\n\"Now, do you know, I like that,\" he cried.  \"That shows spirit.  I am\nglad to see you take it so cheerfully.  Well, I must be going, sir,\" he\nadded, nodding, and moving toward the door.  \"Don't be discouraged.  As\nsomeone says, `It's always morning somewhere,' and in my country\nthere's just as good men out of office as there are in it.  Good-night.\"\n\nWhile the sound of Gordon's footsteps died away across the marble\nterrace, the King and Barrat remained motionless and silent.  The\ndarkness in the room deepened and the silence seemed to deepen with it;\nand still they remained immovable, two shadowy figures in the deserted\napartment where the denunciations of those who had abandoned them still\nseemed to hang and echo in the darkness.  What thoughts passed through\ntheir minds or for how long a time they might still have sat in bitter\ncontemplation can only be guessed, for they were surprised by the sharp\nrattle of a lock, the two great doors of the adjoining room were thrown\nwide open, and a broad and brilliant light flooded the apartment.\nNiccolas, the King's majordomo, stood  between the doors, a black\nsilhouette against the glare of many candles.\n\n\"His Majesty is served!\" he said.\n\nThe King lifted his head sharply, as though he found some lurking\nmockery in the words, or some fresh affront; but in the obsequious bow\nof his majordomo there was no mockery, and the table beyond glistened\nwith silver, while a pungent and convincing odor of rich food was\nwafted insidiously through the open doors.\n\nThe King rose with a gentle sigh, and nodded to his companion.\n\n\"Come, Barrat,\" he said, taking the baron's arm in his.  \"The rascals\nhave robbed us of our throne, but, thank God, they have had the grace\nto leave me my appetite.\""
