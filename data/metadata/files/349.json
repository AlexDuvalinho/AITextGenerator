BELSHAZZAR'S DECISION\n\n“Bel, come here!” The Harvester sat in the hollow worn in the hewed log\nstoop by the feet of his father and mother and his own sturdier tread,\nand rested his head against the casing of the cabin door when he gave\nthe command. The tip of the dog's nose touched the gravel between his\npaws as he crouched flat on earth, with beautiful eyes steadily watching\nthe master, but he did not move a muscle.\n\n“Bel, come here!”\n\nTwinkles flashed in the eyes of the man when he repeated the order,\nwhile his voice grew more imperative as he stretched a lean, wiry\nhand toward the dog. The animal's eyes gleamed and his sensitive nose\nquivered, yet he lay quietly.\n\n“Belshazzar, kommen Sie hier!”\n\nThe body of the dog arose on straightened legs and his muzzle dropped\nin the outstretched palm. A wind slightly perfumed with the odour of\nmelting snow and unsheathing buds swept the lake beside them, and lifted\na waving tangle of light hair on the brow of the man, while a level ray\nof the setting sun flashed across the water and illumined the graven,\nsensitive face, now alive with keen interest in the game being played.\n\n“Bel, dost remember the day?” inquired the Harvester.\n\nThe eager attitude and anxious eyes of the dog betrayed that he did not,\nbut was waiting with every sense alert for a familiar word that would\ntell him what was expected.\n\n“Surely you heard the killdeers crying in the night,” prompted the man.\n“I called your attention when the ecstasy of the first bluebird waked\nthe dawn. All day you have seen the gold-yellow and blood-red osiers,\nthe sap-wet maples and spring tracing announcements of her arrival on\nthe sunny side of the levee.”\n\nThe dog found no clew, but he recognized tones he loved in the suave,\neasy voice, and his tail beat his sides in vigorous approval. The man\nnodded gravely.\n\n“Ah, so! Then you realize this day to be the most important of all the\ncoming year to me; this hour a solemn one that influences my whole after\nlife. It is time for your annual decision on my fate for a twelve-month.\nAre you sure you are fully alive to the gravity of the situation, Bel?”\n\nThe dog felt himself safe in answering a rising inflection ending in his\nname uttered in that tone, and wagged eager assent.\n\n“Well then,” said the man, “which shall it be? Do I leave home for the\nnoise and grime of the city, open an office and enter the money-making\nscramble?”\n\nEvery word was strange to the dog, almost breathlessly waiting for a\nfamiliar syllable. The man gazed steadily into the animal's eyes. After\na long pause he continued:\n\n“Or do I remain at home to harvest the golden seal, mullein, and\nginseng, not to mention an occasional hour with the black bass or tramps\nfor partridge and cotton-tails?”\n\nThe dog recognized each word of that. Before the voice ceased, his sleek\nsides were quivering, his nostrils twitching, his tail lashing, and at\nthe pause he leaped up and thrust his nose against the face of the man.\nThe Harvester leaned back laughing in deep, full-chested tones; then he\npatted the dog's head with one hand and renewed his grip with the other.\n\n“Good old Bel!” he cried exultantly. “Six years you have decided for me,\nand right----every time! We are of the woods, Bel, born and reared\nhere as our fathers before us. What would we of the camp fire, the long\ntrail, the earthy search, we harvesters of herbs the famous chemists\nrequire, what would we do in a city? And when the sap is rising, the\nbass splashing, and the wild geese honking in the night! We never could\nendure it, Bel.\n\n“When we delivered that hemlock at the hospital to-day, did you hear\nthat young doctor talking about his 'lid'? Well up there is ours, old\nfellow! Just sky and clouds overhead for us, forest wind in our faces,\nwild perfume in our nostrils, muck on our feet, that's the life for us.\nOur blood was tainted to begin with, and we've lived here so long it\nis now a passion in our hearts. If ever you sentence us to life in the\ncity, you'll finish both of us, that's what you'll do! But you won't,\nwill you? You realize what God made us for and what He made for us,\ndon't you, Bel?”\n\nAs he lovingly patted the dog's head the man talked and the animal\ntrembled with delight. Then the voice of the Harvester changed and\ndropped to tones of gravest import.\n\n“Now how about that other matter, Bel? You always decide that too. The\ntime has come again. Steady now! This is far more important than the\nother. Just to be wiped out, Bel, pouf! That isn't anything and it\nconcerns no one save ourselves. But to bring misery into our lives\nand live with it daily, that would be a condition to rend the soul. So\ncareful, Bel! Cautious now!”\n\nThe voice of the man dropped to a whisper as he asked the question.\n\n“What about the girl business?”\n\nTrembling with eagerness to do the thing that would bring more\ncaressing, bewildered by unfamiliar words and tones, the dog hesitated.\n\n“Do I go on as I have ever since mother left me, rustling for grub,\nliving in untrammelled freedom? Do I go on as before, Bel?”\n\nThe Harvester paused and waited the answer, with anxiety in his eyes\nas he searched the beast face. He had talked to that dog, as most\nmen commune with their souls, for so long and played the game in such\nintense earnest that he felt the results final with him. The animal was\nimmovable now, lost again, his anxious eyes watching the face of the\nmaster, his eager ears waiting for words he recognized. After a long\ntime the man continued slowly and hesitantly, as if fearing the outcome.\nHe did not realize that there was sufficient anxiety in his voice to\nchange its tones.\n\n“Or do I go courting this year? Do I rig up in uncomfortable\nstore-clothes, and parade before the country and city girls and try to\npersuade the one I can get, probably----not the one I would want----to\nmarry me, and come here and spoil all our good times? Do we want a\nwoman around scolding if we are away from home, whining because she is\nlonesome, fretting for luxuries we cannot afford to give her? Are you\ngoing to let us in for a scrape like that, Bel?”\n\nThe bewildered dog could bear the unusual scene no longer. Taking the\nrising inflection, that sounded more familiar, for a cue, and his name\nfor a certainty, he sprang forward, his tail waving as his nose touched\nthe face of the Harvester. Then he shot across the driveway and lay in\nthe spice thicket, half the ribs of one side aching, as he howled from\nthe lowest depths of dog misery.\n\n“You ungrateful cur!” cried the Harvester. “What has come over you? Six\nyears I have trusted you, and the answer has been right, every time!\nConfound your picture! Sentence me to tackle the girl proposition! I\nsee myself! Do you know what it would mean? For the first thing you'd\nbe chained, while I pranced over the country like a half-broken colt,\ntrying to attract some girl. I'd have to waste time I need for my work\nand spend money that draws good interest while we sleep, to tempt her\nwith presents. I'd have to rebuild the cabin and there's not a chance in\nten she would not fret the life out of me whining to go to the city to\nlive, arrange for her here the best I could. Of all the fool, unreliable\ndogs that ever trod a man's tracks, you are the limit! And you never\nbefore failed me! You blame, degenerate pup, you!”\n\nThe Harvester paused for breath and the dog subsided to a pitiful\nwhimper. He was eager to return to the man who had struck him the first\nblow his pampered body ever had received; but he could not understand a\nkick and harsh words for him, so he lay quivering with anxiety and fear.\n\n“You howling, whimpering idiot!” exclaimed the Harvester. “Choose a\nday like this to spoil! Air to intoxicate a mummy! Roots swelling! Buds\nbursting! Harvest close and you'd call me off and put me at work like\nthat, would you? If I ever had supposed lost all your senses, I never\nwould have asked you. Six years you have decided my fate, when the first\nbluebird came, and you've been true blue every time. If I ever trust you\nagain! But the mischief is done now.\n\n“Have you forgotten that your name means 'to protect?' Don't you\nremember it is because of that, it is your name? Protect! I'd have\ntrusted you with my life, Bell! You gave it to me the time you pointed\nthat rattler within six inches of my fingers in the blood-root bed.\nYou saw the falling limb in time to warn me. You always know where the\nquicksands lie. But you are protecting me now, like sin, ain't you?\nBring a girl here to spoil both our lives! Not if I know myself!\nProtect!”\n\nThe man arose and going inside the cabin closed the door. After that the\ndog lay in abject misery so deep that two big tears squeezed from his\neyes and rolled down his face. To be shut out was worse than the blow.\nHe did not take the trouble to arise from the wet leaves covering the\ncold earth, but closing his eyes went to sleep.\n\nThe man leaned against the door and ran his fingers through his hair as\nhe anathematized the dog. Slowly his eyes travelled around the room. He\nsaw his tumbled bed by the open window facing the lake, the small\ntable with his writing material, the crude rack on the wall loaded\nwith medical works, botanies, drug encyclopaedias, the books of the few\nauthors who interested him, and the bare, muck-tracked floor. He went\nto the kitchen, where he built a fire in the cook stove, and to the\nsmoke-house, from which he returned with a slice of ham and some eggs.\nHe set some potatoes boiling and took bread, butter and milk from the\npantry. Then he laid a small note-book on the table before him and\nstudied the transactions of the day.\n\n     10 lbs. wild cherry bark      6 cents       $.60\n     5   “   wahoo root bark      25 “           1.25\n     20  “   witch hazel bark      5 “           1.00\n     5   “   blue flag root       12 “           .60\n     10  “   snake root           18 “           1.80\n     10  “   blood root           12 “           1.20\n     15  “   hoarhound            10 “           1.50\n                                                 -----\n                                                $7.95\n\n\n“Not so bad,” he muttered, bending over the figures. “I wonder if any\nof my neighbours who harvest the fields average as well at this season.\nI'll wager they don't. That's pretty fair! Some days I don't make it,\nand then when a consignment of seeds go or ginseng is wanted the cash\ncomes in right properly. I could waste half of it on a girl and yet save\nmoney. But where is the woman who would be content with half? She'd want\nall and fret because there wasn't more. Blame that dog!”\n\nHe put the book in his pocket, prepared and ate his supper, heaped a\nplate generously, placed it on the floor beneath the table, and set away\nthe food that remained.\n\n“Not that you deserve it,” he said to space. “You get this in honour\nof your distinguished name and the faithfulness with which you formerly\nhave lived up to its import. If you hadn't been a dog with more sense\nthan some men, I wouldn't take your going back on me now so hard. One\nwould think an animal of your intelligence might realize that you would\nget as much of a dose as I. Would she permit you to eat from a plate on\nthe kitchen floor? Not on your life, Belshazzar! Frozen scraps around\nthe door for you! Would she allow you to sleep across the foot of the\nbed? Ho, ho, ho! Would she have you tracking on her floor? It would be\nthe barn, and growling you didn't do at that. If I'd serve you right,\nI'd give you a dose and allow you to see how you like it. But it's\ncutting off my nose to spite my face, as the old adage goes, for\nwhatever she did to a dog, she'd probably do worse to a man. I think\nnot!”\n\nHe entered the front room and stood before a long shelf on which were\narranged an array of partially completed candlesticks carved from wood.\nThere were black and white walnut, red, white, and golden oak, cherry\nand curly maple, all in original designs. Some of them were oddities,\nothers were failures, but most of them were unusually successful. He\nselected one of black walnut, carved until the outline of his pattern\nwas barely distinguishable. He was imitating the trunk of a tree with\nthe bark on, the spreading, fern-covered roots widening for the base,\nfrom which a vine sprang. Near the top was the crude outline of a big\nnight moth climbing toward the light. He stood turning this stick with\nloving hands and holding it from him for inspection.\n\n“I am going to master you!” he exulted. “Your lines are right. The\ndesign balances and it's graceful. If I have any trouble it will be with\nthe moth, and I think I can manage. I've got to decide whether to use\ncecropia or polyphemus before long. Really, on a walnut, and in\nthe woods, it should be a luna, according to the eternal fitness of\nthings----but I'm afraid of the trailers. They turn over and half curl\nand I believe I had better not tackle them for a start. I'll use the\neasiest to begin on, and if I succeed I'll duplicate the pattern and try\na luna then. The beauties!”\n\nThe Harvester selected a knife from the box and began carving the stick\nslowly and carefully. His brain was busy, for presently he glanced at\nthe floor.\n\n“She'd object to that!” he said emphatically. “A man could no more sit\nand work where he pleased than he could fly. At least I know mother\nnever would have it, and she was no nagger, either. What a mother she\nwas! If one only could stop the lonely feeling that will creep in, and\nthe aching hunger born with the body, for a mate; if a fellow only\ncould stop it with a woman like mother! How she revelled in sunshine and\nbeauty! How she loved earth and air! How she went straight to the marrow\nof the finest line in the best book I could bring from the library! How\nclean and true she was and how unyielding! I can hear her now, holding\nme with her last breath to my promise. If I could marry a girl like\nmother----great Caesar! You'd see me buying an automobile to make the\nrun to the county clerk. Wouldn't that be great! Think of coming in from\na long, difficult day, to find a hot supper, and a girl such as she must\nhave been, waiting for me! Bel, if I thought there was a woman similar\nto her in all the world, and I had even the ghost of a chance to win\nher, I'd call you in and forgive you. But I know the girls of to-day. I\npass them on the roads, on the streets, see them in the cafe's, stores,\nand at the library. Why even the nurses at the hospital, for all the\ngravity of their positions, are a giggling, silly lot; and they never\nknow that the only time they look and act presentably to me is when they\nstop their chatter, put on their uniforms, and go to work. Some of them\nare pretty, then. There's a little blue-eyed one, but all she needs is\nfeathers to make her a 'ha! ha! bird.' Drat that dog!”\n\nThe Harvester took the candlestick and the box of knives, opened the\ndoor, and returned to the stoop. Belshazzar arose, pleading in his eyes,\nand cautiously advanced a few steps. The man bent over his work and paid\nnot the slightest heed, so the discouraged dog sank to earth and fixedly\nwatched the unresponsive master. The carving of the candlestick went\non steadily. Occasionally the Harvester lifted his head and repeatedly\nsucked his lungs full of air. Sometimes for an instant he scanned the\nsurface of the lake for signs of breaking fish or splash of migrant\nwater bird. Again his gaze wandered up the steep hill, crowned with\ngiant trees, whose swelling buds he could see and smell. Straight before\nhim lay a low marsh, through which the little creek that gurgled and\ntumbled down hill curved, crossed the drive some distance below, and\nentered the lake of Lost Loons.\n\nWhile the trees were bare, and when the air was clear as now, he could\nsee the spires of Onabasha, five miles away, intervening cultivated\nfields, stretches of wood, the long black line of the railway, and\nthe swampy bottom lands gradually rising to the culmination of the\ntree-crowned summit above him. His cocks were crowing warlike challenges\nto rivals on neighbouring farms. His hens were carolling their spring\negg-song. In the barn yard ganders were screaming stridently. Over the\nlake and the cabin, with clapping snowy wings, his white doves circled\nin a last joy-flight before seeking their cotes in the stable loft. As\nthe light grew fainter, the Harvester worked slower. Often he leaned\nagainst the casing, and closed his eyes to rest them. Sometimes he\nwhistled snatches of old songs to which his mother had cradled him, and\nagain bits of opera and popular music he had heard on the streets of\nOnabasha. As he worked, the sun went down and a half moon appeared above\nthe wood across the lake. Once it seemed as if it were a silver bowl set\non the branch of a giant oak; higher, it rested a tilted crescent on the\nrim of a cloud.\n\nThe dog waited until he could endure it no longer, and straightening\nfrom his crouching position, he took a few velvet steps forward, making\nfaint, whining sounds in his throat. When the man neither turned his\nhead nor gave him a glance, Belshazzar sank to earth again, satisfied\nfor the moment with being a little closer. Across Loon Lake came the\nwavering voice of a night love song. The Harvester remembered that as a\nboy he had shrunk from those notes until his mother explained that they\nwere made by a little brown owl asking for a mate to come and live\nin his hollow tree. Now he rather liked the sound. It was eloquent of\nearnest pleading. With the lonely bird on one side, and the reproachful\ndog eyes on the other, the man grinned rather foolishly.\n\nBetween two fires, he thought. If that dog ever catches my eye he will\ncome tearing as a cyclone, and I would not kick him again for a hundred\ndollars. First time I ever struck him, and didn't intend to then. So\nblame mad and disappointed my foot just shot out before I knew it. There\nhe lies half dead to make up, but I'm blest if I forgive him in a hurry.\nAnd there is that insane little owl screeching for a mate. If I'd start\nout making sounds like that, all the girls would line up and compete for\npossession of my happy home.\n\nThe Harvester laughed and at the sound Belshazzar took courage and\nadvanced five steps before he sank belly to earth again. The owl\ncontinued its song. The Harvester imitated the cry and at once it\nresponded. He called again and leaned back waiting. The notes came\ncloser. The Harvester cried once more and peered across the lake,\nwatching for the shadow of silent wings. The moon was high above the\ntrees now, the knife dropped in the box, the long fingers closed around\nthe stick, the head rested against the casing, and the man intoned\nthe cry with all his skill, and then watched and waited. He had been\nstraining his eyes over the carving until they were tired, and when\nhe watched for the bird the moonlight tried them; for it touched the\nlightly rippling waves of the lake in a line of yellow light that\nstretched straight across the water from the opposite bank, directly to\nthe gravel bed below, where lay the bathing pool. It made a path of gold\nthat wavered and shimmered as the water moved gently, but it appeared\nsufficiently material to resemble a bridge spanning the lake.\n\n“Seems as if I could walk it,” muttered the Harvester.\n\nThe owl cried again and the man intently watched the opposite bank. He\ncould not see the bird, but in the deep wood where he thought it might\nbe he began to discern a misty, moving shimmer of white. Marvelling, he\nwatched closer. So slowly he could not detect motion it advanced, rising\nin height and taking shape.\n\n“Do I end this day by seeing a ghost?” he queried.\n\nHe gazed intently and saw that a white figure really moved in the woods\nof the opposite bank.\n\n“Must be some boys playing fool pranks!” exclaimed the Harvester.\n\nHe watched fixedly with interested face, and then amazement wiped\nout all other expression and he sat motionless, breathless, looking,\nintently looking. For the white object came straight toward the water\nand at the very edge unhesitatingly stepped upon the bridge of gold and\nlightly, easily advanced in his direction. The man waited. On came\nthe figure and as it drew closer he could see that it was a very tall,\nextremely slender woman, wrapped in soft robes of white. She stepped\nalong the slender line of the gold bridge with grace unequalled.\n\nFrom the water arose a shining mist, and behind the advancing figure\na wall of light outlined and rimmed her in a setting of gold. As she\nneared the shore the Harvester's blood began to race in his veins and\nhis lips parted in wonder. First she was like a slender birch trunk,\nthen she resembled a wild lily, and soon she was close enough to prove\nthat she was young and very lovely. Heavy braids of dark hair rested\non her head as a coronet. Her forehead was low and white. Her eyes were\nwide-open wells of darkness, her rounded cheeks faintly pink, and her\nred lips smiling invitation. Her throat was long, very white, and the\nhands that caught up the fleecy robe around her were rose-coloured and\nslender. In a panic the Harvester saw that the trailing robe swept the\nundulant gold water, but was not wet; the feet that alternately showed\nas she advanced were not purple with cold, but warm with a pink glow.\n\nShe was coming straight toward him, wonderful, alluring, lovely beyond\nany woman the Harvester ever had seen. Straightway the fountains of\ntwenty-six years' repression overflowed in the breast of the man and all\nhis being ran toward her in a wave of desire. On she came, and now her\ntender feet were on the white gravel. When he could see clearly she was\neven more beautiful than she had appeared at a distance. He opened his\nlips, but no sound came. He struggled to rise, but his legs would not\nbear his weight. Helpless, he sank against the casing. The girl walked\nto his feet, bent, placed a hand on each of his shoulders, and smiled\ninto his eyes. He could scent the flower-like odour of her body and\nwrapping, even her hair. He struggled frantically to speak to her as she\nleaned closer, yet closer, and softly but firmly laid lips of pulsing\nsweetness on his in a deliberate kiss.\n\nThe Harvester was on his feet now. Belshazzar shrank into the shadows.\n\n“Come back!” cried the man. “Come back! For the love of mercy, where are\nyou?”\n\nHe ran stumblingly toward the lake. The bridge of gold was there, the\nlittle owl cried lonesomely; and did he see or did he only dream he saw\na mist of white vanishing in the opposite wood?\n\nHis breath came between dry lips, and he circled the cabin searching\neagerly, but he could find nothing, hear nothing, save the dog at his\nheels. He hurried to the stoop and stood gazing at the molten path of\nmoonlight. One minute he was half frozen, the next a rosy glow enfolded\nhim. Slowly he lifted a hand and touched his lips. Then he raised his\neyes from the water and swept the sky in a penetrant gaze.\n\n“My gracious Heavenly Father,” said the Harvester reverently. “Would it\nbe like that?”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE EFFECT OF A DREAM\n\nFully convinced at last that he had been dreaming, the Harvester picked\nup his knives and candlestick and entered the cabin. He placed them on a\nshelf and turned away, but after a second's hesitation he closed the\nbox and arranged the sticks neatly. Then he set the room in order and\ncarefully swept the floor. As he replaced the broom he thought for an\ninstant, then opened the door and whistled softly. Belshazzar came at a\nrush. The Harvester pushed the plate of food toward the hungry dog and\nhe ate greedily. The man returned to the front room and closed the door.\n\nHe stood a long time before his shelf of books, at last selected a\nvolume of “Medicinal Plants” and settled to study. His supper finished,\nBelshazzar came scratching and whining at the door. Several times the\nman lifted his head and glanced in that direction, but he only returned\nto his book and read again. Tired and sleepy, at last, he placed the\nvolume on the shelf, went to a closet for a pair of bath towels, and\nhung them across a chair. Then he undressed, opened the door, and ran\nfor the lake. He plunged with a splash and swam vigorously for a few\nminutes, his white body growing pink under the sting of the chilled\nwater. Over and over he scanned the golden bridge to the moon, and stood\nan instant dripping on the gravel of the landing to make sure that no\ndream woman was crossing the wavering floor! He rubbed to a glow and\nturned back the covers of his bed. The door and window stood wide.\nBefore he lay down, the Harvester paused in arrested motion a second,\nthen stepped to the kitchen door and lifted the latch.\n\nAs the man drew the covers over him, the dog's nose began making\nan opening, and a little later he quietly walked into the room. The\nHarvester rested, facing the lake. The dog sniffed at his shoulder, but\nthe man was rigid. Then the click of nails could be heard on the floor\nas Belshazzar went to the opposite side. At his accustomed place he\npaused and set one foot on the bed. There was not a sound, so he lifted\nthe other. Then one at a time he drew up his hind feet and crouched\nas he had on the gravel. The man lay watching the bright bridge. The\nmoonlight entered the window and flooded the room. The strong lines on\nthe weather-beaten face of the Harvester were mellowed in the light, and\nhe appeared young and good to see. His lithe figure stretched the length\nof the bed, his hair appeared almost white, and his face, touched by the\nglorifying light of the moon, was a study.\n\nOne instant his countenance was swept with ultimate scorn; then\ngradually that would fade and the lines soften, until his lips curved in\nchild-like appeal and his eyes were filled with pleading. Several\ntimes he lifted a hand and gently touched his lips, as if a kiss were a\nmaterial thing and would leave tangible evidence of having been given.\nAfter a long time his eyes closed and he scarcely was unconscious before\nBelshazzar's cold nose touched the outstretched hand and the Harvester\nlifted and laid it on the dog's head.\n\n“Forgive me, Bel,” he muttered. “I never did that. I wouldn't have hurt\nyou for anything. It happened before I had time to think.”\n\nThey both fell asleep. The clear-cut lines of manly strength on the face\nof the Harvester were touched to tender beauty. He lay smiling softly.\nFar in the night he realized the frost-chill and divided the coverlet\nwith the happy Belshazzar.\n\nThe golden dream never came again. There was no need. It had done its\nperfect work. The Harvester awoke the next morning a different man. His\nface was youthful and alive with alert anticipation. He began his work\nwith eager impetuosity, whistling and singing the while, and he found\ntime to play with and talk to Belshazzar, until that glad beast almost\nwagged off his tail in delight. They breakfasted together and arranged\nthe rooms with unusual care.\n\n“You see,” explained the Harvester to the dog, “we must walk neatly\nafter this. Maybe there is such a thing as fate. Possibly your answer\nwas right. There might be a girl in the world for me. I don't expect it,\nbut there is a possibility that she may find us before we locate\nher. Anyway, we should work and be ready. All the old stock in the\nstore-house goes out as soon as we can cart it. A new cabin shall rise\nas fast as we can build it. There must be a basement and furnace, too.\nDream women don't have cold feet, but if there is a girl living like\nthat, and she is coming to us or waiting for us to come to her, we must\nhave a comfortable home to offer. There should be a bathroom, too. She\ncouldn't dip in the lake as we do. And until we build the new house we\nmust keep the old one clean, just on the chance of her happening on us.\nShe might be visiting some of the neighbours or come from town with some\none or I might see her on the street or at the library or hospital or in\nsome of the stores. For the love of mercy, help me watch for her, Bel!\nThe half of my kingdom if you will point her for me!”\n\nThe Harvester worked as he talked. He set the rooms in order, put away\nthe remains of breakfast, and started to the stable. He turned back and\nstood for a long time, scanning the face in the kitchen mirror. Once he\nwent to the door, then he hesitated, and finally took out his shaving\nset and used it carefully and washed vigorously. He pulled his shirt\ntogether at the throat, and hunting among his clothing, found an old\nred tie that he knotted around his neck. This so changed his every-day\nappearance that he felt wonderfully dressed and whistled gaily on his\nway to the barn. There he confided in the old gray mare as he curried\nand harnessed her to the spring wagon.\n\n“Hardly know me, do you, Betsy?” he inquired. “Well, I'll explain. Our\nfriend Bel, here, has doomed me to go courting this year. Wouldn't that\ndurnfound you? I was mad as hornets at first, but since I've slept on\nthe idea, I rather like it. Maybe we are too lonely and dull. Perhaps\nthe right woman would make life a very different matter. Last night\nI saw her, Betsy, and between us, I can't tell even you. She was the\nloveliest, sweetest girl on earth, and that is all I can say. We are\ngoing to watch for her to-day, and every trip we make, until we find\nher, if it requires a hundred years. Then some glad time we are going to\nlocate her, and when we do, well, you just keep your eye on us, Betsy,\nand you'll see how courting straight from the heart is done, even if we\nlack experience.”\n\nIntoxicated with new and delightful sensations his tongue worked faster\nthan his hands.\n\n“I don't mind telling you, old faithful, that I am in love this\nmorning,” he said. “In love heels over, Betsy, for the first time in all\nmy life. If any man ever was a bigger fool than I am to-day, it would\ncomfort me to know about it. I am acting like an idiot, Betsy. I know\nthat, but I wish you could understand how I feel. Power! I am the\nhead-waters of Niagara! I could pluck down the stars and set them in\ndifferent places! I could twist the tail from the comet! I could twirl\nthe globe on my palm and topple mountains and wipe lakes from the\nsurface! I am a live man, Betsy. Existence is over. So don't you go at\nany tricks or I might pull off your head. Betsy, if you see the tallest\ngirl you ever saw, and she wears a dark diadem, and has big black eyes\nand a face so lovely it blinds you, why you have seen Her, and you balk,\nright on the spot, and stand like the rock of Gibraltar, until you\nmake me see her, too. As if I wouldn't know she was coming a mile away!\nThere's more I could tell you, but that is my secret, and it's too\nprecious to talk about, even to my best friends. Bel, bring Betsy to the\nstore-room.”\n\nThe Harvester tossed the hitching strap to the dog and walked down the\ndriveway to a low structure built on the embankment beside the lake.\nOne end of it was a dry-house of his own construction. Here, by an\narrangement of hot water pipes, he evaporated many of the barks, roots,\nseeds, and leaves he grew to supply large concerns engaged in the\nmanufacture of drugs. By his process crude stock was thoroughly cured,\nyet did not lose in weight and colour as when dried in the sun or\noutdoor shade.\n\nSo the Harvester was enabled to send his customers big packages of\nbrightly coloured raw material, and the few cents per pound he asked in\nadvance of the catalogued prices were paid eagerly. He lived alone,\nand never talked of his work; so none of the harvesters of the fields\nadjoining dreamed of the extent of his reaping. The idea had been his\nown. He had been born in the cabin in which he now lived. His father and\ngrandfather were old-time hunters of skins and game. They had added to\ntheir earnings by gathering in spring and fall the few medicinal seeds,\nleaves, and barks they knew. His mother had been of different type. She\nhad loved and married the picturesque young hunter, and gone to live\nwith him on the section of land taken by his father. She found life,\nreal life, vastly different from her girlhood dreams, but she was one of\nthose changeless, unyielding women who suffer silently, but never rue a\nbargain, no matter how badly they are cheated. Her only joy in life had\nbeen her son. For him she had worked and saved unceasingly, and when he\nwas old enough she sent him to the city to school and kept pace with him\nin the lessons he brought home at night.\n\nUsing what she knew of her husband's work as a guide, and profiting by\npamphlets published by the government, every hour of the time outside\nschool and in summer vacations she worked in the woods with the boy,\ngathering herbs and roots to pay for his education and clothing. So\nthe son passed the full high-school course, and then, selecting such\nbranches as interested him, continued his studies alone.\n\nFrom books and drug pamphlets he had learned every medicinal plant,\nshrub, and tree of his vicinity, and for years roamed far afield and\nthrough the woods collecting. After his father's death expenses grew\nheavier and the boy saw that he must earn more money. His mother\nfrantically opposed his going to the city, so he thought out the plan\nof transplanting the stuff he gathered, to the land they owned and\ncultivating it there. This work was well developed when he was twenty,\nbut that year he lost his mother.\n\nFrom that time he went on steadily enlarging his species, transplanting\ntrees, shrubs, vines, and medicinal herbs from such locations as he\nfound them to similar conditions on his land. Six years he had worked\ncultivating these beds, and hunting through the woods on the river\nbanks, government land, the great Limberlost Swamp, and neglected\ncorners of earth for barks and roots. He occasionally made long trips\nacross the country for rapidly diminishing plants he found in the\nwoodland of men who did not care to bother with a few specimens,\nand many big beds of profitable herbs, extinct for miles around, now\nflourished on the banks of Loon Lake, in the marsh, and through the\nforest rising above. To what extent and value his venture had grown, no\none save the Harvester knew. When his neighbours twitted him with\nbeing too lazy to plow and sow, of “mooning” over books, and derisively\nsneered when they spoke of him as the Harvester of the Woods or the\nMedicine Man, David Langston smiled and went his way.\n\nHow lonely he had been since the death of his mother he never realized\nuntil that morning when a new idea really had taken possession of him.\nFrom the store-house he heaped packages of seeds, dried leaves, barks,\nand roots into the wagon. But he kept a generous supply of each, for he\nprided himself on being able to fill all orders that reached him. Yet\nthe load he took to the city was much larger than usual. As he drove\ndown the hill and passed the cabin he studied the location.\n\n“The drainage is perfect,” he said to Belshazzar beside him on the seat.\n“So is the situation. We get the cool breezes from the lake in summer\nand the hillside warmth in winter. View down the valley can't be\nsurpassed. We will grub out that thicket in front, move over the\ndriveway, and build a couple of two-story rooms, with basement for\ncellar and furnace, and a bathroom in front of the cabin and use it with\nsome fixing over for a dining-room and kitchen. Then we will deepen and\nwiden Singing Water, stick a bushel of bulbs and roots and sow a peck of\nflower seeds in the marsh, plant a hedge along the drive, and straighten\nthe lake shore a little. I can make a beautiful wild-flower garden and\narrange so that with one season's work this will appear very well. We\nwill express this stuff and then select and fell some trees to-night.\nSoon as the frost is out of the ground we will dig our basement and lay\nthe foundations. The neighbours will help me raise the logs; after that\nI can finish the inside work. I've got some dried maple, cherry,\nand walnut logs that would work into beautiful furniture. I haven't\nforgotten the prices McLean offered me. I can use it as well as he.\nPlain way the best things are built now, I believe I could make tables\nand couches myself. I can see plans in the magazines at the library.\nI'll take a look when I get this off. I feel strong enough to do all of\nit in a few days and I am crazy to commence. But I scarcely know where\nto begin. There are about fifty things I'd like to do. But to fell and\ndry the trees and get the walls up come first, I believe. What do you\nthink, old unreliable?”\n\nBelshazzar thought the world was a place of beauty that morning. He\nsniffed the icy, odorous air and with tilted head watched the birds.\nA wearied band of ducks had settled on Loon Lake to feed and rest,\nfor there was nothing to disturb them. Signs were numerous everywhere\nprohibiting hunters from firing over the Harvester's land. Beside\nthe lake, down the valley, crossing the railroad, and in the farther\nlowlands, the dog was a nervous quiver, as he constantly scented game\nor saw birds he wanted to point. But when they neared the city, he sat\nsilently watching everything with alert eyes. As they reached the outer\nfringe of residences the Harvester spoke to him.\n\n“Now remember, Bel,” he said. “Point me the tallest girl you ever saw,\nwith a big braid of dark hair, shining black eyes, and red velvet lips,\nsweeter than wild crab apple blossoms. Make a dead set! Don't allow her\nto pass us. Heaven is going to begin in Medicine Woods when we find her\nand prove to her that there lies her happy home.\n\n“When we find her,” repeated the Harvester softly and exultantly. “When\nwe find her!”\n\nHe said it again and again, pronouncing the words with tender\nmodulations. Because he was chanting it in his soul, in his heart,\nin his brain, with his lips, he had a hasty glance for every woman\nhe passed. Light hair, blue eyes, and short figures got only casual\ninspection: but any tall girl with dark hair and eyes endured rather\nclose scrutiny that morning. He drove to the express office and\ndelivered his packages and then to the hospital. In the hall the\nblue-eyed nurse met him and cried gaily, “Good morning, Medicine Man!”\n\n“Ugh! I scalp pale-faces!” threatened the Harvester, but the girl was\nnot afraid and stood before him laughing. She might have gone her way\nquite as well. She could not have differed more from the girl of the\nnewly begun quest. The man merely touched his wide-brimmed hat as he\nwalked around her and entered the office of the chief surgeon.\n\nA slender, gray-eyed man with white hair turned from his desk, smiled\nwarmly, pushed a chair, and reached a welcoming hand.\n\n“Ah good-morning, David,” he cried. “You bring the very breath of spring\nwith you. Are you at the maples yet?”\n\n“Begin to-morrow,” was the answer. “I want to get all my old stock off\nhands. Sugar water comes next, and then the giddy sassafras and spring\nroots rush me, and after that, harvest begins full force, and all\nmy land is teeming. This is going to be a big year. Everything is\nsufficiently advanced to be worth while. I have decided to enlarge the\nbuildings.”\n\n“Store-room too small?”\n\n“Everything!” said the Harvester comprehensively. “I am crowded\neverywhere.”\n\nThe keen gray eyes bent on him searchingly.\n\n“Ho, ho!” laughed the doctor. “'Crowded everywhere.' I had not heard of\ncramped living quarters before. When did you meet her?”\n\n“Last night,” replied the Harvester. “Her home is already in\nconstruction. I chose seven trees as I drove here that are going to fall\nbefore night.”\n\nSo casual was the tone the doctor was disarmed.\n\n“I am trying your nerve remedy,” he said.\n\nInstantly the Harvester tingled with interest.\n\n“How does it work?” he inquired.\n\n“Finely! Had a case that presented just the symptoms you mentioned.\nHigh-school girl broken down from trying to lead her classes, lead her\nfraternity, lead her parents, lead society----the Lord only knows what\nelse. Gone all to pieces! Pretty a case of nervous prostration as you\never saw in a person of fifty. I began on fractional doses with it, and\nat last got her where she can rest. It did precisely what you claimed it\nwould, David.”\n\n“Good!” cried the Harvester. “Good! I hoped it would be effective.\nThank you for the test. It will give me confidence when I go before the\nchemists with it. I've got a couple more compounds I wish you would try\nwhen you have safe cases where you can do no harm.”\n\n“You are cautious for a young man, son!”\n\n“The woods do that. You not only discover miracles and marvels in them,\nyou not only trace evolution and the origin of species, but you get\nthe greatest lessons taught in all the world ground into you early and\nalone----courage, caution, and patience.”\n\n“Those are the rocks on which men are stranded as a rule. You think you\ncan breast them, David?”\n\nThe Harvester laughed.\n\n“Aside from breaking a certain promise mother rooted in the blood and\nbones of me, if I am afraid of anything, I don't know it. You don't\noften see me going head-long, do you? As to patience! Ten years ago I\nbegan removing every tree, bush, vine, and plant of medicinal value from\nthe woods around to my land; I set and sowed acres in ginseng, knowing\nI must nurse, tend, and cultivate seven years. If my neighbours had\nunderstood what I was attempting, what do you think they would have\nsaid? Cranky and lazy would have become adjectives too mild. Lunatic\nwould have expressed it better. That's close the general opinion,\nanyway. Because I will not fell my trees, and the woods hide the work I\ndo, it is generally conceded that I spend my time in the sun reading\na book. I do, as often as I have an opportunity. But the point is that\nthis fall, when I harvest that ginseng bed, I will clear more money than\nmy stiffest detractor ever saw at one time. I'll wager my bank account\nwon't compare so unfavourably with the best of them now. I did well\nthis morning. Yes, I'll admit this much: I am reasonably cautious, I'm\na pattern for patience, and my courage never has failed me yet, anyway.\nBut I must rap on wood; for that boast is a sign that I probably will\nmeet my Jonah soon.”\n\n“David, you are a man after my own heart,” said the doctor. “I love you\nmore than any other friend I have I wouldn't see a hair of your head\nchanged for the world. Now I've got to hurry to my operation. Remain as\nlong as you please if there is anything that interests you; but don't\nlet the giggling little nurse that always haunts the hall when you come\nmake any impression. She is not up to your standard.”\n\n“Don't!” said the Harvester. “I've learned one of the big lessons of\nlife since last I saw you, Doc. I have no standard. There is just one\nwoman in all the world for me, and when I find her I will know her, and\nI will be happy for even a glance; as for that talk of standards, I will\nbe only too glad to take her as she is.”\n\n“David! I supposed what you said about enlarged buildings was nonsense\nor applied to store-rooms.”\n\n“Go to your operation!”\n\n“David, if you send me in suspense, I may operate on the wrong man. What\nhas happened?”\n\n“Nothing!” said the Harvester. “Nothing!”\n\n“David, it is not like you to evade. What happened?”\n\n“Nothing! On my word! I merely saw a vision and dreamed a dream.”\n\n“You! A rank materialist! Saw a vision and dreamed a dream! And you\ncall it nothing. Worst thing that could happen! Whenever a man of\ncommon-sense goes to seeing things that don't exist, and dreaming\ndreams, why look out! What did you see? What did you dream?”\n\n“You woman!” laughed the Harvester. “Talk about curiosity! I'd have to\nbe a poet to describe my vision, and the dream was strictly private.\nI couldn't tell it, not for any price you could mention. Go to your\noperation.”\n\nThe doctor paused on the threshold.\n\n“You can't fool me,” he said. “I can diagnose you all right. You are\npoet enough, but the vision was sacred; and when a man won't tell, it's\nalways and forever a woman. I know all now I ever will, because I know\nyou, David. A man with a loose mouth and a low mind drags the women of\nhis acquaintance through whatever mire he sinks in; but you couldn't\ntell, David, not even about a dream woman. Come again soon! You are\nmy elixir of life, lad! I revel in the atmosphere you bring. Wish me\nsuccess now, I am going to a difficult, delicate operation.”\n\n“I do!” cried the Harvester heartily. “I do! But you can't fail. You\nnever have and that proves you cannot! Good-bye!”\n\nDown the street went the Harvester, passing over city pave with his\nfree, swinging stride, his head high, his face flushed with vivid\noutdoor tints, going somewhere to do something worth while, the\nimpression always left behind him. Men envied his robust appearance and\nwomen looked twice, always twice, and sometimes oftener if there was any\nopportunity; but twice at least was the rule. He left a little roll of\nbills at the bank and started toward the library. When he entered the\nreading room an attendant with an eager smile hastily came toward him.\n\n“What will you have this morning, Mr. Langston?” she asked in the voice\nof one who would render willing service.\n\n“Not the big books to-day,” laughed the Harvester. “I've only a short\ntime. I'll glance through the magazines.”\n\nHe selected several from a table and going to a corner settled with them\nand for two hours was deeply engrossed. He took an envelope from his\npocket, traced lines, and read intently. He studied the placing of\nrooms, the construction of furniture, and all attractive ideas were\nnoted. When at last he arose the attendant went to replace the magazines\non the table. They had been opened widely, and as she turned the\nleaves they naturally fell apart at the plans for houses or articles of\nfurniture.\n\nThe Harvester slowly went down the street. Before every furniture store\nhe paused and studied the designs displayed in the windows. Then he\nuntied Betsy and drove to a lumber mill on the outskirts of the city and\nmade arrangements to have some freshly felled logs of black walnut\nand curly maple sawed into different sizes and put through a course in\ndrying.\n\nHe drove back to Medicine Woods whistling, singing, and talking to\nBelshazzar beside him. He ate a hasty lunch and at three o'clock was in\nthe forest, blazing and felling slender, straight-trunked oak and ash of\nthe desired proportions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. HARVESTING THE FOREST\n\n\nThe forest is never so wonderful as when spring wrestles with winter for\nsupremacy. While the earth is yet ice bound, while snows occasionally\nfly, spring breathes her warmer breath of approach, and all nature\nresponds. Sunny knolls, embankments, and cleared spaces become bare,\nwhile shadow spots and sheltered nooks remain white. This perfumes the\nicy air with a warmer breath of melting snow. The sap rises in the trees\nand bushes, sets buds swelling, and they distil a faint, intangible\nodour. Deep layers of dead leaves cover the frozen earth, and the sun\nshining on them raises a steamy vapour unlike anything else in nature. A\ndifferent scent rises from earth where the sun strikes it. Lichen faces\ntake on the brightest colours they ever wear, and rough, coarse mosses\nemerge in rank growth from their cover of snow and add another perfume\nto mellowing air. This combination has breathed a strange intoxication\ninto the breast of mankind in all ages, and bird and animal life prove\nby their actions that it makes the same appeal to them.\n\nCrows caw supremacy from tall trees; flickers, drunk on the wine of\nnature, flash their yellow-lined wings and red crowns among trees in a\nsearch for suitable building places; nut-hatches run head foremost down\nrough trunks, spying out larvae and early emerging insects; titmice\nchatter; the bold, clear whistle of the cardinal sounds never so gaily;\nand song sparrows pipe from every wayside shrub and fence post. Coons\nand opossums stir in their dens, musk-rat and ground-hog inspect the\nweather, while squirrels race along branches and bound from tree to tree\nlike winged folk.\n\nAll of them could have outlined the holdings of the Harvester almost\nas well as any surveyor. They understood where the bang of guns and the\nsnap of traps menaced life. Best of all, they knew where cracked nuts,\nhandfuls of wheat, oats, and crumbs were scattered on the ground, and\nwhere suet bones dangled from bushes. Here, too, the last sheaf from the\nsmall wheat field at the foot of the hill was stoutly fixed on a high\npole, so that the grain was free to all feathered visitors.\n\nWhen the Harvester hitched Betsy, loaded his spiles and sap buckets\ninto the wagon, and started to the woods to gather the offering the wet\nmaples were pouring down their swelling sides, almost his entire family\ncame to see him. They knew who fed and passed every day among them, and\nso were unafraid.\n\nAfter the familiarity of a long, cold winter, when it had been easier\nto pick up scattered food than to search for it, they became so friendly\nwith the man, the dog, and the gray horse that they hastily snatched\nthe food offered at the barn and then followed through the woods. The\nHarvester always was particular to wear large pockets, for it was good\ncompany to have living creatures flocking after him, trusting to his\nbounty. Ajax, a shimmering wonder of gorgeous feathers, sunned on the\nridge pole of the old log stable, preened, spread his train, and uttered\nthe peacock cry of defiance, to exercise his voice or to express his\nemotions at all times. But at feeding hour he descended to the park and\nsnatched bites from the biggest turkey cocks and ganders and reigned in\npower absolute over ducks, guineas, and chickens. Then he followed to\nthe barn and tried to frighten crows and jays, and the gentle white\ndoves under the eaves.\n\nThe Harvester walked through deep leaves and snow covering the road that\nonly a forester could have distinguished. Over his shoulder he carried\na mattock, and in the wagon were his clippers and an ax. Behind him came\nBetsy drawing the sap buckets and big evaporating kettles. Through the\nwood ranged Belshazzar, the craziest dog in all creation. He always went\nwild at sap time. Here was none of the monotony of trapping for skins\naround the lake. This marked the first full day in the woods for\nthe season. He ranged as he pleased and came for a pat or a look of\nconfidence when he grew lonely, while the Harvester worked.\n\nAt camp the man unhitched Betsy and tied her to the wagon and for\nseveral hours distributed buckets. Then he hung the kettles and gathered\nwood for the fire. At noon he returned to the cabin for lunch and\nbrought back a load of empty syrup cans, and barrels in which to collect\nthe sap. While the buckets filled at the dripping trees, he dug roots in\nthe sassafras thicket to fill orders and supply the demand of Onabasha\nfor tea. Several times he stopped to cut an especially fine tree.\n\n“You know I hate to kill you,” he apologized to the first one he felled.\n“But it certainly must be legitimate for a man to take enough of his\ntrees to build a home. And no other house is possible for a creature of\nthe woods but a cabin, is there? The birds use of the material they find\nhere; surely I have the right to do the same. Seems as if nothing else\nwould serve, at least for me. I was born and reared here, I've always\nloved you; of course, I can't use anything else for my home.”\n\nHe swung the ax and the chips flew as he worked on a straight half-grown\noak. After a time he paused an instant and rested, and as he did so he\nlooked speculatively at his work.\n\n“I wonder where she is to-day,” he said. “I wonder what she is going to\nthink of a log cabin in the woods. Maybe she has been reared in the\ncity and is afraid of a forest. She may not like houses made of logs.\nPossibly she won't want to marry a Medicine Man. She may dislike the\nman, not to mention his occupation. She may think it coarse and common\nto work out of doors with your hands, although I'd have to argue there\nis a little brain in the combination. I must figure out all these\nthings. But there is one on the lady: She should have settled these\npoints before she became quite so familiar. I have that for a foundation\nanyway, so I'll go on cutting wood, and the remainder will be up to her\nwhen I find her. When I find her,” repeated the Harvester slowly. “But I\nam not going to locate her very soon monkeying around in these woods. I\nshould be out where people are, looking for her right now.”\n\nHe chopped steadily until the tree crashed over, and then, noticing a\nrapidly filling bucket, he struck the ax in the wood and began gathering\nsap. When he had made the round, he drove to the camp, filled the\nkettles, and lighted the fire. While it started he cut and scraped\nsassafras roots, and made clippings of tag alder, spice brush and white\nwillow into big bundles that were ready to have the bark removed during\nthe night watch, and then cured in the dry-house.\n\nHe went home at evening to feed the poultry and replenish the\never-burning fire of the engine and to keep the cabin warm enough that\nfood would not freeze. With an oilcloth and blankets he returned to camp\nand throughout the night tended the buckets and boiling sap, and worked\nor dozed by the fire between times. Toward the end of boiling, when the\nsap was becoming thick, it had to be watched with especial care so it\nwould not scorch. But when the kettles were freshly filled the Harvester\nsat beside them and carefully split tender twigs of willow and slipped\noff the bark ready to be spread on the trays.\n\n“You are a good tonic,” he mused as he worked, “and you go into some of\nthe medicine for rheumatism. If she ever has it we will give her some\nof you, and then she will be all right again. Strange that I should be\npreparing medicinal bark by the sugar camp fire, but I have to make this\nhay, not while the sun shines, but when the bark is loose, while the sap\nis rising. Wonder who will use this. Depends largely on where I sell it.\nAnyway, I hope it will take the pain out of some poor body. Prices so\nlow now, not worth gathering unless I can kill time on it while waiting\nfor something else. Never got over seven cents a pound for the best I\never sold, and it takes a heap of these little quills to make a pound\nwhen they are dry. That's all of you----about twenty-five cents' worth.\nBut even that is better than doing nothing while I wait, and some one\nhas to keep the doctors supplied with salicin and tannin, so, if I do,\nother folks needn't bother.”\n\nHe arose and poured more sap into the kettles as it boiled away and\nreplenished the fire. He nibbled a twig when he began on the spice\nbrush. As he sat on the piled wood, and bent over his work he was\nan attractive figure. His face shone with health and was bright with\nanticipation. While he split the tender bark and slipped out the wood he\nspoke his thoughts slowly:\n\n“The five cents a pound I'll get for you is even less, but I love the\nfragrance and taste. You don't peel so easy as the willow, but I like\nto prepare you better, because you will make some miserable little sick\nchild well or you may cool some one's fevered blood. If ever she has a\nfever, I hope she will take medicine made from my bark, because it will\nbe strong and pure. I've half a notion to set some one else gathering\nthe stuff and tending the plants and spend my time in the little\nlaboratory compounding different combinations. I don't see what bigger\nthing a man can do than to combine pure, clean, unadulterated roots and\nbarks into medicines that will cool fevers, stop chills, and purify bad\nblood. The doctors may be all right, but what are they going to do if we\nmen behind the prescription cases don't supply them with unadulterated\ndrugs. Answer me that, Mr. Sapsucker. Doc says I've done mighty well so\nfar as I have gone. I can't think of a thing on earth I'd rather do, and\nthere's money no end in it. I could get too rich for comfort in short\norder. I wouldn't be too wealthy to live just the way I do for any\nconsideration. I don't know about her, though. She is lovely, and\nhandsome women usually want beautiful clothing, and a quantity of things\nthat cost no end of money. I may need all I can get, for her. One never\ncan tell.”\n\nHe arose to stir the sap and pour more from the barrels to the kettles\nbefore he began on the tag alder he had gathered.\n\n“If it is all the same to you, I'll just keep on chewing spice brush\nwhile I work,” he muttered. “You are entirely too much of an astringent\nto suit my taste and you bring a cent less a pound. But you are thicker\nand dry heavier, and you grow in any quantity around the lake and on the\nmarshy places, so I'll make the size of the bundle atone for the price.\nIf I peel you while I wait on the sap I'm that much ahead. I can spread\nyou on drying trays in a few seconds and there you are. Howl your head\noff, Bel, I don't care what you have found. I wouldn't shoot anything\nto-day, unless the cupboard was bare and I was starvation hungry. In\nthat case I think a man comes first, and I'd kill a squirrel or quail\nin season, but blest if I'd butcher a lot or do it often. Vegetables\nand bread are better anyway. You peel easier even than the willow. What\njolly whistles father used to make!\n\n“There was about twenty cents' worth of spice, and I'll easy raise it to\na dollar on this. I'll get a hundred gallons of syrup in the coming two\nweeks and it will bring one fifty if I boil and strain it carefully and\ncan guarantee it contains no hickory bark and brown sugar. And it won't!\nStraight for me or not at all. Pure is the word at Medicine Woods; syrup\nor drugs it's the same thing. Between times I can fell every tree I'll\nneed for the new cabin, and average a dollar a day besides on spice,\nalder, and willow, and twice that for sassafras for the Onabasha\nmarkets; not to mention the quantities I can dry this year. Aside from\nspring tea, they seem to use it for everything. I never yet have had\nenough. It goes into half the tonics, anodyne, and stimulants; also soap\nand candy. I see where I grow rich in spite of myself, and also where my\nharvest is going to spoil before I can garner it, if I don't step\nlively and double even more than I am now. Where the cabin is to come\nin----well it must come if everything else goes.\n\n“The roots can wait and I'll dig them next year and get more and larger\npieces. I won't really lose anything, and if she should come before I\nam ready to start to find her, why then I'll have her home prepared.\nHow long before you begin your house, old fire-fly?” he inquired of a\nflaming cardinal tilting on a twig.\n\nHe arose to make the round of the sap buckets again, then resumed his\nwork peeling bark, and so the time passed. In the following ten days he\ncollected and boiled enough sap to make more syrup than he had expected.\nHis earliest spring store of medicinal twigs, that were peeled to dry in\nquills, were all collected and on the trays; he had digged several wagon\nloads of sassafras and felled all the logs of stout, slender oak he\nwould require for his walls. Choice timber he had been curing for\ncandlestick material he hauled to the saw-mills to have cut properly,\nfor the thought of trying his hand at tables and chairs had taken\npossession of him. He was sure he could make furniture that would appear\nquite as well as the mission pieces he admired on display in the store\nwindows of the city. To him, chairs and tables made from trees that grew\non land that had belonged for three generations to his ancestors, trees\namong which he had grown, played, and worked, trees that were so much\nhis friends that he carefully explained the situation to them before\nusing an ax or saw, trees that he had cut, cured, and fashioned into\ndesigns of his own, would make vastly more valuable furnishings in his\nhome than anything that could be purchased in the city.\n\nAs he drove back and forth he watched constantly for her. He was working\nso desperately, planning far ahead, doubling and trebling tasks, trying\nto do everything his profession demanded in season, and to prepare\ntimber and make plans for the new cabin, as well as to start a pair\nof candlesticks of marvellous design for her, that night was one\nlong, unbroken sleep of the thoroughly tired man, but day had become a\ndelightful dream.\n\nHe fed the chickens to produce eggs for her. He gathered barks and\nsluiced roots on the raft in the lake, for her. He grubbed the spice\nthicket before the door and moved it into the woods to make space for a\nlawn, for her. His eyes were wide open for every woven case and dangling\ncocoon of the big night moths that propagated around him, for her. Every\nnight when he left the woods from one to a dozen cocoons, that he had\ndetected with remarkable ease while the trees were bare, were stuck\nin his hat band. As he arranged them in a cool, dry place he talked to\nthem.\n\n“Of course I know you are valuable and there are collectors who would\npay well for you, but I think not. You are the prettiest thing God made\nthat I ever saw, and those of you that home with me have no price on\nyour wings. You are much safer here than among the crows and jays of the\nwoods. I am gathering you to protect you, and to show to her. If I don't\nfind her by June, you may go scot free. All I want is the best pattern\nI can get from some of you for candlestick designs. Of everything in the\nwhole world a candlestick should be made of wood. It should be carved\nby hand, and of all ornamentations on earth the moth that flies to the\nnight light is the most appropriate. Owls are not so bad. They are of\nthe night, and they fly to light, too, but they are so old. Nobody I\never have known used a moth. They missed the best when they neglected\nthem. I'll make her sticks over an original pattern; I'll twine\nnightshade vines, with flowers and berries around them, and put a\ntrailed luna on one, and what is the next prettiest for the other? I'll\nthink well before if decide. Maybe she'll come by the time I get to\ncarving and tell me what she likes. That would beat my taste or guessing\na mile.”\n\nHe carefully arranged the twigs bearing cocoons in a big, wire-covered\nbox to protect them from the depredations of nibbling mice and the\nbolder attacks of the saucy ground squirrels that stored nuts in his\nloft and took possession of the attic until their scampering sometimes\nawoke him in the night.\n\nEvery trip he made to the city he stopped at the library to examine\nplans of buildings and furniture and to make notes. The oak he had\nhauled was being hewed into shape by a neighbour who knew how, and every\nwagon that carried a log to the city to be dressed at the mill brought\nback timber for side walls, joists, and rafters. Night after night he\nsat late poring over his plans for the new rooms, above all for her\nchamber. With poised pencil he wavered over where to put the closet and\nentrance to her bath. He figured on how wide to make her bed and where\nit should stand. He remembered her dressing table in placing windows\nand a space for a chest of drawers. In fact there was nothing the active\nmind of the Harvester did not busy itself with in those days that might\nmake a woman a comfortable home. Every thought emanated from impulses\nevolved in his life in the woods, and each was executed with mighty\ntenderness.\n\nA killdeer sweeping the lake close two o'clock one morning awakened him.\nHe had planned to close the sugar camp for the season that day, but when\nhe heard the notes of the loved bird he wondered if that would not be a\ngood time to stake out the foundations and begin digging. There was yet\nice in the ground, but the hillside was rapidly thawing, and although\nthe work would be easier later, so eager was the Harvester to have walls\nup and a roof over that he decided to commence.\n\nBut when morning came and he and Belshazzar breakfasted and fed Betsy\nand the stock, he concluded to return to his first plan and close the\ncamp. All the sap collected that day went into the vinegar barrel. He\nloaded the kettles, buckets, and spiles and stopped at the spice thicket\nto cut a bale of twigs as he passed. He carried one load to the wagon\nand returned for another. Down wind on swift wing came a bird and\nentered the bushes. Motionless the Harvester peered at it. A mourning\ndove had returned to him through snow, skifting over cold earth. It\nsettled on a limb and began dressing its plumage. At that instant a\nwavering, “Coo coo a'gh coo,” broke in sobbing notes from the deep wood.\nWithout paying the slightest heed, the dove finished a wing, ruffled\nand settled her feathers, and opened her bill in a human-like yawn. The\nHarvester smiled. The notes swelled closer in renewed pleading. The cry\nwas beyond doubt a courting male and this an indifferent female.\nHer beady eyes snapped, her head turned coquettishly, a picture of\nself-possession, she hid among the dense twigs of the spice thicket.\nAround the outside circled the pleading male.\n\nWith shining eyes the Harvester watched. These were of the things\nthat made life in the woods most worth while. More insistent grew the\nwavering notes of the lover. More indifferent became the beloved. She\nwas superb in her poise as she amused herself in hiding. A perfect burst\nof confused, sobbing notes broke on the air. Then away in the deep wood\na softly-wavering, half-questioning “Coo-ah!” answered them. Amazement\nflashed into the eyes of the Harvester, but his face was not nearly so\nexpressive as that of the bird. She lifted a bewildered head and grew\nrigid in an attitude of tense listening. There was a pause. In quicker\nmeasure and crowding notes the male called again. Instantly the soft\n“Coo!” wavered in answer. The surprised little hen bird of the thicket\nhopped straight up and settled on her perch again, her dark eyes\nindignant as she uttered a short “Coo!” The muscles of the Harvester's\nchest were beginning to twitch and quiver. More intense grew the notes\nof the pleading male. Softly seductive came the reply. The clapping\nof his wings could be heard as he flew in search of the charmer. “A'gh\ncoo!” cried the deserted female as she tilted off the branch and tore\nthrough the thicket in pursuit, with wings hastened by fright at the\nringing laugh of the Harvester.\n\n“Not so indifferent after all, Bel,” he said to the dog standing in\nstiff point beside him. “That was all 'pretend!' But she waited just a\ntrifle too long. Now she will have to fight it out with a rival. Good\nthing if some of the flirtatious women could have seen that. Help them\nto learn their own minds sooner.”\n\nHe laughed as he heaped the twigs on top of the wagon and started down\nthe hill chuckling. Belshazzar followed, leading Betsy straight in the\nmiddle of the road by the hitching strap. A few yards ahead the man\nstopped suddenly with lifted hand. The dog and horse stood motionless.\nA dove flashed across the road and settled in sight on a limb. Almost\nsimultaneously another perched beside it, and they locked bills in a\nlong caress, utterly heedless of a plaintive “Coo” in the deep wood.\n\n“Settled!” said the Harvester. “Jupiter! I wish my troubles were that\nnearly finished! Wish I knew where she is and how to find my way to her\nlips! Wonder if she will come when I call her. What if I should\nfind her, and she would have everything on earth, other lovers, and\nindifference worse than Madam Dove's for me. Talk about bitterness! Well\nI'd have the dream left anyway. And there are always two sides. There is\njust a possibility that she may be poor and overworked, sick and tired,\nand wondering why I don't come. Possibly she had a dream, too, and she\nwishes I would hurry. Dear Lord!”\n\nThe Harvester began to perspire as he strode down the hill. He scarcely\nwaited to hang the harness properly. He did not stop to unload the wagon\nuntil night, but went after an ax and a board that he split into pegs.\nThen he took a ball of twine, a measuring line, and began laying out his\nfoundation, when the hard earth would scarcely hold the stakes he drove\ninto it. When he found he only would waste time in digging he put away\nthe neatly washed kettles, peeled the spice brush, spread it to dry, and\nprepared his dinner. After that he began hauling stone and cement for\nhis basement floor and foundation walls. Occasionally he helped at\nhewing logs when the old man paused to rest. That afternoon the first\nrobin of the season hailed him in passing.\n\n“Hello!” cried the Harvester. “You don't mean to tell me that you have\nbeaten the larks! You really have! Well since I see it, I must believe,\nbut you are early. Come around to the back door if crumbs or wheat will\ndo or if you can make out on suet and meat bones! We are good and ready\nfor you. Where is your mate? For any sake, don't tell me you don't know.\nOne case of that kind at Medicine Woods is enough. Say you came ahead\nto see if it is too cold or to select a home and get ready for her. Say\nanything on earth except that you love her, and want her until your body\nis one quivering ache, and you don't know where she is.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. A COMMISSION FOR THE SOUTH WIND\n\nThe next morning the larks trailed ecstasy all over the valley, the\nfollowing day cuckoos were calling in the thickets, a warm wind swept\nfrom the south and set swollen buds bursting, while the sun shone,\ncausing the Harvester to rejoice. Betsy's white coat was splashed with\nthe mud of the valley road; the feet of Belshazzar left tracks over\nlumber piles; and the Harvester removed his muck-covered shoes at the\ndoor and wore slippers inside. The skunk cabbage appeared around the\nedge of the forest, rank mullein and thistles lay over the fields in\nbig circles of green, and even plants of delicate growth were thrusting\ntheir heads through mellowing earth and dead leaves, to reach light and\nair.\n\nThen the Harvester took his mattock and began to dig. His level best\nfell so far short of what he felt capable of doing and desired to\naccomplish that the following day he put two more men on the job. Then\nthe earth did fly, and so soon as the required space was excavated the\nwalls were lined with stone and a smooth basement floor was made of\ncement. The night the new home stood, a skeleton of joists and rafters,\ngleaming whitely on the banks of Loon Lake, the Harvester went to the\nbridge crossing Singing Water and slowly came up the driveway to see how\nthe work appeared. He caught his breath as he advanced. He had intended\nto stake out generous rooms, but this, compared with the cabin, seemed\nlike a big hotel.\n\n“I hope I haven't made it so large it will be a burden,” he\nsoliloquized. “It's huge! But while I am at it I want to build big\nenough, and I think I have.”\n\nHe stood on the driveway, his arms folded, and looked at the structure\nas he occasionally voiced his thoughts.\n\n“The next thing is to lay up the side walls and get the roof over. Got\nto have plenty of help, for those logs are hewed to fourteen inches\nsquare and some of them are forty feet long. That's timber! Grew with\nme, too. Personally acquainted with almost every tree of it. We will bed\nthem in cement, use care with the roof, and if that doesn't make a cool\nhouse in the summer, and a warm one in winter, I'll be disappointed.\nIt sets among the trees, and on the hillside just right. We must have a\nwide porch, plenty of flowers, vines, ferns, and mosses, and when I get\neverything finished and she sees it----perhaps it will please her.”\n\nA great horned owl swept down the hill, crossed the lake, and hooted\nfrom the forest of the opposite bank. The Harvester thought of his dream\nand turned.\n\n“Any women walking the water to-night? Come if you like,” he bantered,\n“I don't mind in the least. In fact, I'd rather enjoy it. I'd be so\nhappy if you would come now and tell me how this appears to you,\nfor it's all yours. I'd have enlarged the store-room, dry-houses and\nlaboratory for myself, but this cabin, never! The old one suited me as\nit was; but for you----I should have a better home.”\n\nThe Harvester glanced from the shining skeleton to the bridge of gold\nand back again.\n\n“Where are you to-night?” he questioned. “What are you doing? Can't you\ngive me a hint of where to search for you when this is ready? I don't\nknow but I am beginning wrong. My little brothers of the wood do\ndifferently. They announce their intentions the first thing, flaunt\ntheir attractions, and display their strength. They say aloud, for all\nthe listening world to hear, what is in their hearts. They chip, chirp,\nand sing, warble, whistle, thrill, scream, and hoot it. They are strong\non self-expression, and appreciative of their appearance. They meet,\ncourt, mate, and THEN build their home together after a mutual plan.\nIt's a good way, too! Lots surer of getting things satisfactory.”\n\nThe Harvester sat on a lumber pile and gazed questioningly at the\nframework.\n\n“I wish I knew if I am going at things right,” he said. “There are two\nsides to consider. If she is in a good home, and lovingly cared for, it\nwould be proper to court her and get her promise, if I could----no I'm\nblest if I'll be so modest----get her promise, as I said, and let her\nwait while I build the cabin. But if she should be poor, tired, and\nneglected, then I ought to have this ready when I find her, so I could\npick her up and bring her to it, with no more ceremony than the birds.”\n\nThe Harvester's clear skin flushed crimson.\n\n“Of course, I don't mean no wedding ceremony,” he amended. “I was\nthinking of a long time wasted in preliminaries when in my soul I know I\nam going to marry my Dream Girl before I ever have seen her in reality.\nWhat would be the use in spending much time in courting? She is my wife\nnow, by every law of God. Let me get a glimpse of her, and I'll prove\nit. But I've got to make tracks, for if she were here, where would I put\nher? I must hurry!”\n\nHe went to the work room and began polishing a table top. He had bought\na chest of tools and was spending every spare minute on tables,\nchair seats, and legs. He had decided to make these first and carve\ncandlesticks later when he had more time. Two hours he worked at the\nfurniture, and then went to bed. The following morning he put eggs under\nseveral hens that wanted to set, trimmed his grape-vines, examined the\nprecious ginseng beds, attended his stock, got breakfast for Belshazzar\nand himself, and was ready for work when the first carpenter arrived.\nLaying hewed logs went speedily, and before the Harvester believed it\npossible the big shingles he had ordered were being nailed on the roof.\nThen came the plumber and arranged for the bathroom, and the furnace\nman placed the heating pipes. The Harvester had intended the cabin to\nbe mostly the work of his own hands, but when he saw how rapidly\nskilled carpenters worked, he changed his mind and had them finish the\nliving-room, his room, and the upstairs, and make over the dining-room\nand kitchen.\n\nHer room he worked on alone, with a little help if he did not know how\nto join the different parts. Every thing was plain and simple, after\nplans of his own, but the Harvester laid floors and made window casings,\nseats, and doors of wood that the big factories of Grand Rapids used in\nveneering their finest furniture. When one of his carpenters pointed\nout this to him, and suggested that he sell his lumber to McLean and use\npine flooring from the mills the Harvester laughed at him.\n\n“I don't say that I could afford to buy burl maple, walnut, and cherry\nfor wood-work,” said the Harvester. “I could not, but since I have it,\nyou can stake your life I won't sell it and build my home of cheap,\nrapidly decaying wood. The best I have goes into this cabin and what\nremains will do to sell. I have an idea that when this is done it is\ngoing to appear first rate. Anyway, it will be solid enough to last\na thousand years, and with every day of use natural wood grows more\nbeautiful. When we get some tables, couches, and chairs made from the\nsame timber as the casings and the floors, I think it will be fine.\nI want money, but I don't want it bad enough to part with the BEST of\nanything I have for it. Go carefully and neatly there; it will have to\nbe changed if you don't.”\n\nSo the work progressed rapidly. When the carpenters had finished the\nlast stroke on the big veranda they remained a day more and made flower\nboxes, and a swinging couch, and then the greedy Harvester kept the best\nman with him a week longer to help on the furniture.\n\n“Ain't you going to say a word about her, Langston?” asked this man as\nthey put a mirror-like surface on a curly maple dressing table top.\n\n“Her!” ejaculated the Harvester. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I haven't seen you bathe anywhere except in the lake since I have been\nhere,” said the carpenter. “Do you want me to think that a porcelain\ntub, this big closet, and chest of drawers are for you?”\n\nA wave of crimson swept over the Harvester.\n\n“No, they are not for me,” he said simply. “I don't want to be any more\ndifferent from other men than I can help, although I know that life in\nthe woods, the rigid training of my mother, and the reading of only the\nbooks that would aid in my work have made me individual in many of my\nthoughts and ways. I suppose most men, just now, would tell you anything\nyou want to know. There is only one thing I can say: The best of my soul\nand brain, the best of my woods and store-house, the best I can buy with\nmoney is not good enough for her. That's all. For myself, I am getting\nready to marry, of course. I think all normal men do and that it is a\nmatter of plain common-sense that they should. Life with the right woman\nmust be infinitely broader and better than alone. Are you married?”\n\n“Yes. Got a wife and four children.”\n\n“Are you sorry?”\n\n“Sorry!” the carpenter shrilled the word. “Sorry! Well that's the best\nI ever heard! Am I sorry I married Nell and got the kids? Do I look\nsorry?”\n\n“I am not expecting to be, either,” said the Harvester calmly. “I think\nI have done fairly well to stick to my work and live alone until I am\ntwenty-six. I have thought the thing all over and made up my mind. As\nsoon as I get this house far enough along that I feel I can proceed\nalone I am going to rush the marrying business just as fast as I can,\nand let her finish the remainder to her liking.”\n\n“Well this ought to please her.”\n\n“That's because you find your own work good,” laughed the Harvester.\n\n“Not altogether!” The carpenter polished the board and stood it on end\nto examine the surface as he talked. “Not altogether! Nothing but good\nwork would suit you. I was thinking of the little creek splashing down\nthe hill to the lake; and that old log hewer said that in a few more\ndays things here would be a blaze of colour until fall.”\n\n“Almost all the drug plants and bushes leaf beautifully and flower\nbrilliantly,” explained the Harvester. “I studied the location suitable\nto each variety before I set the beds and planned how to grow plants\nfor continuity of bloom, and as much harmony of colour as possible.\nOf course a landscape gardener would tear up some of it, but seen as a\nwhole it isn't so bad. Did you ever notice that in the open, with God's\nblue overhead and His green for a background, He can place purple and\nyellow, pink, magenta, red, and blue in masses or any combination you\ncan mention and the brighter the colour the more you like it? You\ndon't seem to see or feel that any grouping clashes; you revel in each\nwonderful growth, and luxuriate in the brilliancy of the whole. Anyway,\nthis suits me.”\n\n“I guess it will please her, too,” said the carpenter. “After all the\npains you've taken, she is a good one if it doesn't.”\n\n“I'll always have the consolation of having done my best,” replied\nthe Harvester. “One can't do more! Whether she likes it or not depends\ngreatly on the way she has been reared.”\n\n“You talk as if you didn't know,” commented the carpenter.\n\n“You go on with this now,” said the Harvester hastily. “I've got to\nuncover some beds and dig my year's supply of skunk cabbage, else folk\nwith asthma and dropsy who depend on me will be short on relief. I ought\nto take my sweet flag, too, but I'm so hurried now I think I'll leave it\nuntil fall; I do when I can, because the bloom is so pretty around the\nlake and the bees simply go wild over the pollen. Sometimes I almost\nthink I can detect it in their honey. Do you know I've wondered often\nif the honey my bees make has medicinal properties and should be kept\nseparate in different seasons. In early spring when the plants and\nbushes that furnish the roots and barks of most of the tonics are in\nbloom, and the bees gather the pollen, that honey should partake in a\ndegree of the same properties and be good medicine. In the summer\nit should aid digestion, and in the fall cure rheumatism and blood\ndisorders.”\n\n“Say you try it!” urged the carpenter. “I want a lot of the fall kind.\nI'm always full of rheumatism by October. Exposure, no doubt.”\n\n“Over eating of too much rich food, you mean,” laughed the Harvester.\n“I'd like to see any man expose his body to more differing extremes of\nweather than I do, and I'm never sick. It's because I am my own cook\nand so I live mostly on fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, and eggs, a few\nfish from the lake, a little game once in a great while or a chicken,\nand no hot drinks; plenty of fresh water, air, and continuous work out\nof doors. That's the prescription! I'd be ashamed to have rheumatism at\nyour age. There's food in the cupboard if you grow hungry. I am going\npast one of the neighbours on my way to see about some work I want her\nto do.”\n\nThe Harvester stopped for lunch, carried food to Belshazzar, and started\nstraight across country, his mattock, with a bag rolled around the\nhandle, on his shoulder. His feet sank in the damp earth at the foot of\nthe hill, and he laughed as he leaped across Singing Water.\n\n“You noisy chatterbox!” cried the man. “The impetus of coming down the\ncurves of the hill keeps you talking all the way across this muck bed to\nthe lake. With small work I can make you a thing of beauty. A few bushes\ngrubbed, a little deepening where you spread too much, and some more\nmallows along the banks will do the trick. I must attend to you soon.”\n\n“Now what does the boy want?” laughed a white-haired old woman, as the\nHarvester entered the door. “Mebby you think I don't know what you're\nup to! I even can hear the hammering and the voices of the men when the\nwind is in the south. I've been wondering how soon you'd need me. Out\nwith it!”\n\n“I want you to get a woman and come over and spend a day with me.\nI'll come after you and bring you back. I want you to go over mother's\nbedding and have what needs it washed. All I want you to do is to\nsuperintend, and tell me now what I will want from town for your work.”\n\n“I put away all your mother's bedding that you were not using, clean as\na ribbon.”\n\n“But it has been packed in moth preventives ever since and out only four\ntimes a year to air, as you told me. It must smell musty and be yellow.\nI want it fresh and clean.”\n\n“So what I been hearing is true, David?”\n\n“Quite true!” said the Harvester.\n\n“Whose girl is she, and when are you going to jine hands?”\n\nThe Harvester lifted his clear eyes and hesitated.\n\n“Doc Carey laid you in my arms when you was born, David. I tended you\n'fore ever your ma did. All your life you've been my boy, and I love you\nsame as my own blood; it won't go no farther if you say so. I'll never\ntell a living soul. But I'm old and 'til better weather comes, house\nbound; and I get mighty lonely. I'd like to think about you and her, and\nplan for you, and love her as I always did you folks. Who is she, David?\nDo I know the family?”\n\n“No. She is a stranger to these parts,” said the unhappy Harvester.\n\n“David, is she a nice girl 'at your ma would have liked?”\n\n“She's the only girl in the world that I'd marry,” said the Harvester\npromptly, glad of a question he could answer heartily. “Yes. She is\ngentle, very tender and----and affectionate,” he went on so rapidly that\nGranny Moreland could not say a word, “and as soon as I bring her home\nyou shall come to spend a day and get acquainted. I know you will love\nher! I'll come in the morning, then. I must hurry now. I am working\ndouble this spring and I'm off for the skunk cabbage bed to-day.”\n\n“You are working fit to kill, the neighbours say. Slavin' like a horse\nall day, and half the night I see your lights burning.”\n\n“Do I appear killed?” laughingly inquired the Harvester.\n\n“You look peart as a struttin' turkey gobbler,” said the old woman. “Go\non with your work! Work don't hurt a-body. Eat a-plenty, sleep all you\nort, and you CAN'T work enough to hurt you.”\n\n“So the neighbours say I'm working now? New story, isn't it? Usually I'm\ntoo lazy to make a living, if I remember.”\n\n“Only to those who don't sense your purceedings, David. I always knowed\nhow you grubbed and slaved an' set over them fearful books o' yours.”\n\n“More interesting than the wildest fiction,” said the man. “I'm making\nsome medicine for your rheumatism, Granny. It is not fully tested yet,\nbut you get ready for it by cutting out all the salt you can. I haven't\ntime to explain this morning, but you remember what I say, leave out the\nsalt, and when Doc thinks it's safe I'll bring you something that will\nmake a new woman of you.”\n\nHe went swinging down the road, and Granny Moreland looked after him.\n\n“While he was talkin',” she muttered, “I felt full of information as a\nflock o' almanacs, but now since he's gone, 'pears to me I don't know a\nthing more 'an I did to start on.”\n\n“Close call,” the Harvester was thinking. “Why the nation did I admit\nanything to her? People may talk as they please, so long as I don't\nsanction it, but I have two or three times. That's a fool trick. Suppose\nI can't find her? Maybe she won't look at me if I can. Then I'd have\nstarted something I couldn't finish. And if anybody thinks I'll end\nthis by taking any girl I can get, if I can't find Her, why they think\nwrongly. Just the girl of my golden dream or no woman at all for me.\nI've lived alone long enough to know how to do it in comfort. If I can't\nfind and win her I have no intention of starting a boarding house.”\n\nThe Harvester began to laugh. “'I'd rather keep bachelor's hall in Hell\nthan go to board in Heaven!'” he quoted gaily. “That's my sentiment too.\nIf you can't have what you want, don't have anything. But there is no\nuse to become discouraged before I start. I haven't begun to hunt her\nyet. Until I do, I might as well believe that she will walk across the\nbridge and take possession just as soon as I get the last chair leg\npolished. She might! She came in the dream, and to come actually\ncouldn't be any more real. I'll make a stiff hunt of it before I give\nup, if I ever do. I never yet have made a complete failure of anything.\nBut just now I am hunting skunk cabbage. It's precisely the time to take\nit.”\n\nAcross the lake, in the swampy woods, close where the screech owl sang\nand the girl of the golden dream walked in the moonlight the Harvester\nbegan operations. He unrolled the sack, went to one end of the bed and\nsystematically started a swath across it, lifting every other plant\nby the roots. Flowering time was almost past, but the bees knew where\npollen ripened, and hummed incessantly over and inside the queer\ncone-shaped growths with their hooked beaks. It almost appeared as if\nthe sound made inside might be to give outsiders warning not to poach\non occupied territory, for the Harvester noticed that no bee entered a\npre-empted plant.\n\nWith skilful hand each stroke brought up a root and he tossed it to one\nside. The plants were vastly peculiar things. First they seemed to be a\ncurled leaf with no flower. In colour they shaded from yellow to almost\nblack mahogany, and appeared as if they were a flower with no leaf.\nCloser examination proved there was a stout leaf with a heavy outside\nmid-rib, the tip of which curled over in a beak effect, that wrapped\naround a peculiar flower of very disagreeable odour. The handling of\nthese plants by the hundred so intensified this smell the Harvester\nshook his head.\n\n“I presume you are mostly mine,” he said to the busy little workers\naround him. “If there is anything in my theory of honey having varying\nmedicinal properties at different seasons, right now mine should be\ngood for Granny's rheumatism and for nervous and dropsical people. I\nshouldn't think honey flavoured with skunk cabbage would be fit to eat.\nBut, of course, it isn't all this. There is catkin pollen on the wind,\nhazel and sassafras are both in bloom now, and so are several of the\nearliest little flowers of the woods. You can gather enough of them\ncombined to temper the disagreeable odour into a racy sweetness, and all\nthe shrub blooms are good tonics, too, and some of the earthy ones. I'm\ngoing to try giving some of you empty cases next spring and analyzing\nthe honey to learn if it isn't good medicine.”\n\nThe Harvester straightened and leaned on the mattock to fill his lungs\nwith fresh air and as he delightedly sniffed it he commented, “Nothing\nelse has much of a chance since I've stirred up the cabbage bed. I can\nscent the catkins plainly, being so close, and as I came here I could\ndetect the hazel and sassafras all right.”\n\nAbove him a peculiar, raucous chattering for an instant hushed other\nwood voices. The Harvester looked up, laughing gaily.\n\n“So you've decided to announce it to your tribe at last, have you?”\n he inquired. “You are waking the sleepers in their dens to-day? Well,\nthere's nothing like waiting until you have a sure thing. The bluebirds\nbroke the trail for the feathered folk the twenty-fourth of February.\nThe sap oozed from the maples about the same time for the trees. The\nvery first skunk cabbage was up quite a month ago to signal other plants\nto come on, and now you are rousing the furred folk. I'll write this\ndown in my records----'When the earliest bluebird sings, when the sap\nwets the maples, when the skunk cabbage flowers, and the first striped\nsquirrel barks, why then, it is spring!'”\n\nHe bent to his task and as he worked closer the water he noticed\nsweet-flag leaves waving two inches tall beneath the surface.\n\n“Great day!” he cried. “There you are making signs, too! And right! Of\ncourse! Nature is always right. Just two inches high and it's harvest\nfor you. I can use a rake, and dried in the evaporator you bring me\nten cents a pound; to the folks needing a tonic you are worth a small\nfortune. No doubt you cost that by the time you reach them; but I fear\nI can't gather you just now. My head is a little preoccupied these days.\nWhat with the cabbage, and now you, and many of the bushes and trees\nmaking signs, with a new cabin to build and furnish, with a girl to find\nand win, I'm what you might call busy. I've covered my book shelf.\nI positively don't dare look Emerson or Maeterlinck in the face. One\nconsolation! I've got the best of Thoreau in my head, and if I read\nStickeen a few times more I'll be able to recite that. There's a man for\nyou, not to mention the dog! Bel, where are you? Would you stick to me\nlike that? I think you would. But you are a big, strong fellow. Stickeen\nwas only such a mite of a dog. But what a man he followed! I feel as\nif I should put on high-heeled slippers and carry a fan and a lace\nhandkerchief when I think of him. And yet, most men wouldn't consider my\njob so easy!”\n\nThe Harvester rapidly pitched the evil-smelling plants into big heaps\nand as he worked he imitated the sounds around him as closely as he\ncould. The song sparrow laughed at him and flew away in disgust when he\ntried its notes. The jay took time to consider, but was not fooled. The\nnut-hatch ran head first down trees, larvae hunting, and was never a\nmite deceived. But the killdeer on invisible legs, circling the lake\nshore, replied instantly; so did the lark soaring above, and the dove of\nthe elm thicket close beside. The glittering black birds flashing over\nevery tree top answered the “T'check, t'chee!” of the Harvester quite as\nreadily as their mates.\n\nThe last time he paused to rest he had studied scents. When he\nstraightened again he was occupied with every voice of earth and air\naround and above him, and the notes of singing hens, exultant cocks, the\nscream of geese, the quack of ducks, the rasping crescendo of guineas\nrunning wild in the woods, the imperial note of Ajax sunning on the\nridge pole and echoes from all of them on adjoining and distant farms.\n\n“'Now I see the full meaning and beauty of that word sound!'” quoted\nthe Harvester. “'I thank God for sound. It always mounts and makes me\nmount!'”\n\nHe breathed deeply and stood listening, a superb figure of a man, his\nlean face glowing with emotion.\n\n“If she could see and hear this, she would come,” he said softly. “She\nwould come and she would love it as I do. Any one who understands,\nand knows how to translate, cares for this above all else earth has to\noffer. They who do not, fail to read as they run!”\n\nHe shifted feet mired in swamp muck, and stood as if loath to bend again\nto his task. He lifted a weighted mattock and scraped the earth from\nit, sniffing it delightedly the while. A soft south wind freighted with\naromatic odours swept his warm face. The Harvester removed his hat and\nshook his head that the breeze might thread his thick hair.\n\n“I've a commission for you, South Wind,” he said whimsically. “Go find\nmy Dream Girl. Go carry her this message from me. Freight your breath\nwith spicy pollen, sun warmth, and flower nectar. Fill all her senses\nwith delight, and then, close to her ear, whisper it softly, 'Your lover\nis coming!' Tell her that, O South Wind! Carry Araby to her nostrils,\nHeaven to her ears, and then whisper and whisper it over and over until\nyou arouse the passion of earth in her blood. Tell her what is rioting\nin my heart, and brain, and soul this morning. Repeat it until she must\nawake to its meaning, 'Your lover is coming.'”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. WHEN THE HARVESTER MADE GOOD\n\nThe sassafras and skunk cabbage were harvested. The last workman was\ngone. There was not a sound at Medicine Woods save the babel of bird and\nanimal notes and the never-ending accompaniment of Singing Water. The\ngeese had gone over, some flocks pausing to rest and feed on Loon Lake,\nand ducks that homed there were busy among the reeds and rushes. In\nthe deep woods the struggle to maintain and reproduce life was at its\nheight, and the courting songs of gaily coloured birds were drowned by\nhawk screams and crow calls of defiance.\n\nEvery night before he plunged into the lake and went to sleep the\nHarvester made out a list of the most pressing work that he would\nundertake on the coming day. By systematizing and planning ahead he was\nable to accomplish an unbelievable amount. The earliest rush of spring\ndrug gathering was over. He could be more deliberate in collecting the\nbarks he wanted. Flowers that were to be gathered at bloom time and\nleaves were not yet ready. The heavy leaf coverings he had helped\nthe winds to heap on his beds of lily of the valley, bloodroot, and\nsarsaparilla were removed carefully.\n\nInside the cabin the Harvester cleaned the glass, swept the floors with\na soft cloth pinned over the broom, and hung pale yellow blinds at the\nwindows. Every spare minute he worked on making furniture, and with each\npiece he grew in experience and ventured on more difficult undertakings.\nHe had progressed so far that he now allowed himself an hour each day on\nthe candlesticks for her. Every evening he opened her door and with soft\ncloths polished the furniture he had made. When her room was completed\nand the dining-room partially finished, the Harvester took time to stain\nthe cabin and porch roofs the shade of the willow leaves, and on the\nlogs and pillars he used oil that served to intensify the light yellow\nof the natural wood. With that much accomplished he felt better. If she\ncame now, in a few hours he would be able to offer a comfortable room,\nenough conveniences to live until more could be provided, and of food\nthere was always plenty.\n\nHis daily programme was to feed and water his animals and poultry,\nprepare breakfast for himself and Belshazzar, and go to the woods,\ndry-house or store-room to do the work most needful in his harvesting.\nIn the afternoon he laboured over furniture and put finishing touches on\nthe new cabin, and after supper he carved and found time to read again,\nas before his dream.\n\nHe was so happy he whistled and sang at his work much of the time at\nfirst, but later there came days when doubts crept in and all his will\npower was required to proceed steadily. As the cabin grew in better\nshape for occupancy each day, more pressing became the thought of how he\nwas going to find and meet the girl of his dream. Sometimes it seemed to\nhim that the proper way was to remain at home and go on with his work,\ntrusting her to come to him. At such times he was happy and gaily\nwhistled and sang:\n\n     “Stay in your chimney corner,\n          Don't roam the world about,\n       Stay in your chimney corner,\n          And your own true love will find you out.”\n\n\nBut there were other days while grubbing in the forest, battling with\nroots in the muck and mire of the lake bank, staggering under a load\nfor two men, scarcely taking time to eat and sleep enough to keep his\ncondition perfect, when that plan seemed too hopeless and senseless to\ncontemplate. Then he would think of locking the cabin, leaving the drugs\nto grow undisturbed by collecting, hiring a neighbour to care for his\nliving creatures, and starting a search over the world to find her.\nThere came times when the impulse to go was so strong that only the\ndesire to take a day more to decide where, kept him. Every time his mind\nwas made up to start the following day came the counter thought, what\nif I should go and she should come in my absence? In the dream she came.\nThat alone held him, even in the face of the fact that if he left home\nsome one might know of and rifle the precious ginseng bed, carefully\ntended these seven years for the culmination the coming fall would\nbring. That ginseng was worth many thousands and he had laboured over\nit, fighting worms and parasites, covering and uncovering it with the\nchanging seasons, a siege of loving labour.\n\nSometimes a few hours of misgiving tortured him, but as a rule he was\ncheerful and happy in his preparations. Without intending to do it\nhe was gradually furnishing the cabin. Every few days saw a new piece\nfinished in the workshop. Each trip to Onabasha ended in the purchase of\nsome article he could see would harmonize with his colour plans for\none of the rooms. He had filled the flower boxes for the veranda with\ndelicate plants that were growing luxuriantly.\n\nThen he designed and began setting a wild-flower garden outside her door\nand started climbing vines over the logs and porches, but whatever he\nplanted he found in the woods or took from beds he cultivated. Many of\nthe medicinal vines had leaves, flowers, twining tendrils, and berries\nor fruits of wonderful beauty. Every trip to the forest he brought back\na half dozen vines, plants, or bushes to set for her. All of them either\nbore lovely flowers, berries, quaint seed pods, or nuts, and beside the\ndrive and before the cabin he used especial care to plant a hedge of\nbittersweet vines, burning bush, and trees of mountain ash, so that\nthe glory of their colour would enliven the winter when days might be\ngloomy.\n\nHe planted wild yam under her windows that its queer rattles might amuse\nher, and hop trees where their castanets would play gay music with every\npassing wind of fall. He started a thicket along the opposite bank of\nSinging Water where it bubbled past her window, and in it he placed in\ngraduated rows every shrub and small tree bearing bright flower, berry,\nor fruit. Those remaining he used as a border for the driveway from the\nlake, so that from earliest spring her eyes would fall on a procession\nof colour beginning with catkins and papaw lilies, and running through\nalders, haws, wild crabs, dogwood, plums, and cherry intermingled with\nforest saplings and vines bearing scarlet berries in fall and winter. In\nthe damp soil of the same character from which they were removed, in\nthe shade and under the skilful hand of the Harvester, few of these\nknew they had been transplanted, and when May brought the catbirds and\norioles much of this growth was flowering quite as luxuriantly as the\nsame species in the woods.\n\nThe Harvester was in the store-house packing boxes for shipment. His\nroom was so small and orders so numerous that he could not keep large\nquantities on hand. All crude stuff that he sent straight from the\ndrying-house was fresh and brightly coloured. His stock always was\nmarked prime A-No. 1. There was a step behind him and the Harvester\nturned. A boy held out a telegram. The man opened it to find an order\nfor some stuff to be shipped that day to a large laboratory in Toledo.\n\nHis hands deftly tied packages and he hastily packed bottles and nailed\nboxes. Then he ran to harness Betsy and load. As he drove down the hill\nto the bridge he looked at his watch and shook his head.\n\n“What are you good for at a pinch, Betsy?” he asked as he flecked the\nsurprised mare's flank with a switch. Belshazzar cocked his ears and\ngazed at the Harvester in astonishment.\n\n“That wasn't enough to hurt her,” explained the man. “She must speed up.\nThis is important business. The amount involved is not so much, but I do\nlove to make good. It's a part of my religion, Bel. And my religion has\nso precious few parts that if I fail in the observance of any of them\nit makes a big hole in my performances. Now we don't want to end a life\nfull of holes, so we must get there with this stuff, not because it's\nworth the exertion in dollars and cents, but because these men patronize\nus steadily and expect us to fill orders, even by telegraph. Hustle,\nBetsy!”\n\nThe whip fell again and Belshazzar entered indignant protest.\n\n“It isn't going to hurt her,” said the Harvester impatiently. “She may\nwalk all the way back. She can rest while I get these boxes billed and\nloaded if she can be persuaded to get them to the express office on\ntime. The trouble with Betsy is that she wants to meander along the road\nwith a loaded wagon as her mother and grandmother before her wandered\nthrough the woods wearing a bell to attract the deer. Father used to say\nthat her mother was the smartest bell mare that ever entered the forest.\nShe'd not only find the deer, but she'd make friends with them and lead\nthem straight as a bee-line to where he was hiding. Betsy, you must\ntravel!”\n\nThe Harvester drew the lines taut, and the whip fell smartly. The\nastonished Betsy snorted and pranced down the valley as fast as she\ncould, but every step indicated that she felt outraged and abused. This\nwas the loveliest day of the season. The sun was shining, the air was\nheavy with the perfume of flowering shrubs and trees, the orchards of\nthe valley were white with bloom. Farmers were hurrying back and forth\nacross fields, leaving up turned lines of black, swampy mould behind\nthem, and one progressive individual rode a wheeled plow, drove three\nhorses and enjoyed the shelter of a canopy.\n\n“Saints preserve us, Belshazzar!” cried the Harvester. “Do you see that?\nHe is one of the men who makes a business of calling me shiftless. Now\nhe thinks he is working. Working! For a full-grown man, did you ever see\nthe equal? If I were going that far I'd wear a tucked shirt, panama hat,\nhave a pianola attachment, and an automatic fan.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed as he again touched Betsy and hurried to Onabasha.\nHe scarcely saw the delights offered on either hand, and where his\neyes customarily took in every sight, and his ears were tuned for\nthe faintest note of earth or tree top, to day he saw only Betsy and\nlistened for a whistle he dreaded to hear at the water tank. He climbed\nthe embankment of the railway at a slower pace, but made up time going\ndown hill to the city.\n\n“I am not getting a blame thing out of this,” he complained to\nBelshazzar. “There are riches to stagger any scientist wasting to-day,\nand all I've got to show is one oriole. I did hear his first note and\nsee his flash, and so unless we can take time to make up for this on the\nhome road we will have to christen it oriole day. It's a perfumed golden\nday, too; I can get that in passing, but how I loathe hurrying. I don't\nmind planning things and working steadily, but it's not consistent with\nthe dignity of a sane man to go rushing across country with as much\nappreciation of the delights offered right now as a chicken with its\nhead off would have. We will loaf going back to pay for this! And won't\nwe invite our souls? We will stop and gather a big bouquet of crab\napple blossoms to fill the green pitcher for her. Maybe some of their\nwonderful perfume will linger in her room. When the petals fall we will\nscatter them in the drawers of her dresser, and they may distil a faint\nflower odour there. We could do that to all her furniture, but perhaps\nshe doesn't like perfume. She'll be compelled to after she reaches\nMedicine Woods. Betsy, you must travel faster!”\n\nThe whip fell again and the Harvester stopped at the depot with a few\nminutes to spare. He threw the hitching strap to Belshazzar, and ran\ninto the express office with an arm load of boxes.\n\n“Bill them!” he cried. “It's a rush order. I want it to go on the\nnext express. Almost due I think. I'll help you and we can book them\nafterward.”\n\nThe expressman ran for a truck and they hastily weighed and piled on\nboxes. When the last one was loaded from the wagon, a heap more lying in\nthe office were added, pitched on indiscriminately as the train pulled\nunder the sheds of the Union Station.\n\n“I'll push,” cried the Harvester, “and help you get them on.”\n\nHurrying as fast as he could the expressman drew the heavy truck through\nthe iron gates and started toward the train slowing to a stop, and the\nHarvester pushed. As they came down the platform they passed the dining\nand sleeping cars of the long train and were several times delayed\nby descending passengers. Just opposite the day coach the expressman\nnarrowly missed running into several women leading small children and\nstopped abruptly. A toppling box threatened the head of the Harvester.\nHe peered around the truck and saw they must wait a few seconds. He put\nin the time watching the people. A gray-haired old man, travelling in a\nsilk hat, wavered on the top step and went his way. A fat woman loaded\nwith bundles puffed as she clung trembling a second in fear she would\nmiss the step she could not see. A tall, slender girl with a face coldly\nwhite came next, and from the broken shoe she advanced, the bewildered\nfright of big, dark eyes glancing helplessly, the Harvester saw that she\nwas poor, alone, ill, and in trouble. Pityingly he turned to watch her,\nand as he gauged her height, saw her figure, and a dark coronet of hair\ncame into view, a ghastly pallor swept his face.\n\n“Merciful God!” he breathed, “that's my Dream Girl!”\n\nThe truck started with a jerk. The toppling box fell, struck a passing\nboy, and knocked him down. The mother screamed and the Harvester sprang\nto pick up the child and see that he was not dangerously hurt. Then he\nran after the truck, pitched on the box, and whirling, sped beside the\ntrain toward the gates of exit. There was the usual crush, but he could\nsee the tall figure passing up the steps to the depot. He tried to\nforce his way and was called a brute by a crowded woman. He ran down the\nplatform to the gates he had entered with the truck. They were automatic\nand had locked. Then he became a primal creature being cheated of a\nlawful mate and climbed the high iron fence and ran for the waiting\nroom.\n\nHe swept it at a glance, not forgetting the women's apartment and the\nside entrance. Then he hurried to the front exit. Up the street leading\nfrom the city there were few people and he could see no sign of the\nslight, white-faced girl. He crossed the sidewalk and ran down the\ngutter for a block and breathlessly waited the passing crowd on the\ncorner. She was not among it. He tried one more square. Still he could\nnot see her. Then he ran back to the depot. He thought surely he must\nhave missed her. He again searched the woman's and general waiting room\nand then he thought of the conductor. From him it could be learned where\nshe entered the car. He ran for the station, bolted the gate while the\nofficial called to him, and reached the track in time to see the train\npull out within a few yards of him.\n\n“You blooming idiot!” cried the angry expressman as the Harvester ran\nagainst him, “where did you go? Why didn't you help me? You are white as\na sheet! Have you lost your senses?”\n\n“Worse!” groaned the Harvester. “Worse! I've lost what I prize most on\nearth. How could I reach the conductor of that train?”\n\n“Telegraph him at the next station. You can have an answer in a half\nhour.”\n\nThe Harvester ran to the office, and with shaking hand wrote this\nmessage:\n\n“Where did a tall girl with big black eyes and wearing a gray dress take\nyour train? Important.”\n\nThen he went out and minutely searched the depot and streets. He hired\nan automobile to drive him over the business part of Onabasha for three\nquarters of an hour. Up one street and down another he went slowly where\nthere were crowds, faster as he could, but never a sight of her. Then he\nreturned to the depot and found his message. It read, “Transferred to me\nat Fort Wayne from Chicago.”\n\n“Chicago baggage!” he cried, and hurried to the check room. He had lost\nalmost an hour. When he reached the room he found the officials busy and\nunwilling to be interrupted. Finally he learned there had been a half\ndozen trunks from Chicago. All were taken save two, and one glance at\nthem told the Harvester that they did not belong to the girl in gray.\nThe others had been claimed by men having checks for them. If she had\nbeen there, the officials had not noticed a tall girl having a white\nface and dark eyes. When he could think of no further effort to make he\ndrove to the hospital.\n\nDoctor Carey was not in his office, and the Harvester sat in the\nrevolving chair before the desk and gripped his head between his hands\nas he tried to think. He could not remember anything more he could\nhave done, but since what he had done only ended in failure, he was\nreproaching himself wildly that he had taken his eyes from the Girl an\ninstant after recognizing her. Yet it was in his blood to be decent and\nhe could not have run away and left a frightened woman and a hurt child.\nTrusting to his fleet feet and strength he had taken time to replace the\nbox also, and then had met the crowd and delay. Just for the instant it\nappeared to him as if he had done all a man could, and he had not found\nher. If he allowed her to return to Chicago, probably he never would. He\nleaned his head on his hands and groaned in discouragement.\n\nDoctor Carey whirled the chair so that it faced him before the Harvester\nrealized that he was not alone.\n\n“What's the trouble, David?” he asked tersely.\n\nThe Harvester lifted a strained face.\n\n“I came for help,” he said.\n\n“Well you will get it! All you have to do is to state what you want.”\n\nThat seemed simplicity itself to the doctor. But when it came to putting\nhis case into words, it was not easy for the Harvester.\n\n“Go on!” said the doctor.\n\n“You'll think me a fool.”\n\nThe doctor laughed heartily.\n\n“No doubt!” he said soothingly. “No doubt, David! Probably you are; so\nwhy shouldn't I think so. But remember this, when we make the biggest\nfools of ourselves that is precisely the time when we need friends, and\nwhen they stick to us the tightest, if they are worth while. I've been\nwaiting since latter February for you to tell me. We can fix it, of\ncourse; there's always a way. Go on!”\n\n“Well I wasn't fooling about the dream and the vision I told you of\nthen, Doc. I did have a dream--and it was a dream of love. I did see a\nvision--and it was a beautiful woman.”\n\n“I hope you are not nursing that experience as something exclusive and\npeculiar to you,” said the doctor. “There is not a normal, sane man\nliving who has not dreamed of love and the most exquisite woman who came\nfrom the clouds or anywhere and was gracious to him. That's a part of a\nman's experience in this world, and it happens to most of us, not once,\nbut repeatedly. It's a case where the wish fathers the dream.”\n\n“Well it hasn't happened to me 'on repeated occasions,' but it did one\nnight, and by dawn I was converted. How CAN a dream be so real, Doc?\nHow could I see as clearly as I ever saw in the daytime in my most alert\nmoment, hear every step and garment rustle, scent the perfume of hair,\nand feel warm breath strike my face? I don't understand it!”\n\n“Neither does any one else! All you need say is that your dream was real\nas life. Go on!”\n\n“I built a new cabin and pretty well overturned the place and I've been\nmaking furniture I thought a woman would like, and carrying things from\ntown ever since.”\n\n“Gee! It was reality to you, lad!”\n\n“Nothing ever more so,” said the Harvester.\n\n“And of course, you have been looking for her?”\n\n“And this morning I saw her!”\n\n“David!”\n\n“Not the ghost of a chance for a mistake. Her height, her eyes, her\nhair, her walk, her face; only something terrible has happened since she\ncame to me. It was the same girl, but she is ill and in trouble now.”\n\n“Where is she?”\n\n“Do you suppose I'd be here if I knew?”\n\n“David, are you dreaming in daytime?”\n\n“She got off the Chicago train this morning while I was helping Daniels\nload a big truck of express matter. Some of it was mine, and it was\nimportant. Just at the wrong instant a box fell and knocked down a child\nand I got in a jam----”\n\n“And as it was you, of course you stopped to pick up the child and do\neverything decent for other folks, before you thought of yourself, and\nso you lost her. You needn't tell me anything more. David, if I find\nher, and prove to you that she has been married ten years and has an\ninteresting family, will you thank me?”\n\n“Can't be done!” said the Harvester calmly. “She has been married only\nsince she gave herself to me in February, and she is not a mother. You\nneedn't bank on that.”\n\n“You are mighty sure!”\n\n“Why not? I told you the dream was real, and now that I have seen her,\nand she is in this very town, why shouldn't I be sure?”\n\n“What have you done?”\n\nThe Harvester told him.\n\n“What are you going to do next?”\n\n“Talk it over with you and decide.”\n\nThe doctor laughed.\n\n“Well here are a few things that occur to me without time for thought.\nTalk to the ticket agents, and leave her description with them. Make it\nworth their while to be on the lookout, and if she goes anywhere to find\nout all they can. They could make an excuse of putting her address on\nher ticket envelope, and get it that way. See the baggagemen. Post the\nday police on Main Street. There is no chance for her to escape you. A\nfull-grown woman doesn't vanish. How did she act when she got off the\ncar? Did she appear familiar?”\n\n“No. She was a stranger. For an instant she looked around as if she\nexpected some one, then she followed the crowd. There must have been an\nautomobile waiting or she took a street car. Something whirled her out\nof sight in a few seconds.”\n\n“Well we will get her in range again. Now for the most minute\ndescription you can give.”\n\nThe Harvester hesitated. He did not care to describe the Dream Girl to\nany one, much less the living, suffering face and poorly clad form of\nthe reality.\n\n“Cut out your scruples,” laughed the doctor. “You have asked me to help\nyou; how can I if I don't know what kind of a woman to look for?”\n\n“Very tall and slender,” said the Harvester. “Almost as tall as I am.”\n\n“Unusually tall you think?”\n\n“I know!”\n\n“That's a good point for identification. How about her complexion, hair,\nand eyes?”\n\n“Very large, dark eyes, and a great mass of black hair.”\n\nThe doctor roared.\n\n“The eyes may help,” he said. “All women have masses of hair these days.\nI hope----”\n\n“Her hair is fast to her head,” said the Harvester indignantly. “I saw\nit at close range, and I know. It went around like a crown.”\n\nThe doctor choked down a laugh. He wanted to say that every woman's hair\nwas like a crown at present, but there were things no man ventured with\nDavid Langston; those who knew him best, least of any. So he suggested,\n“And her colouring?”\n\n“She was white and rosy, a lovely thing in the dream,” said the\nHarvester, “but something dreadful has happened. That's all wiped out\nnow. She was very pale when she left the car.”\n\n“Car sick, maybe.”\n\n“Soul sick!” was the grim reply.\n\nThen Doctor Carey appeared so disturbed the Harvester noticed it.\n\n“You needn't think I'd be here prating about her if I wasn't FORCED.\nIf she had been rosy and well as she was in the dream, I'd have made\nmy hunt alone and found her, too. But when I saw she was sick and in\ntrouble, it took all the courage out of me, and I broke for help. She\nmust be found at once, and when she is you are probably the first man\nI'll want. I am going to put up a pretty stiff search myself, and if I\nfind her I'll send or get her to you if I can. Put her in the best ward\nyou have and anything money will do----”\n\nThe face of the doctor was growing troubled.\n\n“Day coach or Pullman?” he asked.\n\n“Day.”\n\n“How was she dressed?”\n\n“Small black hat, very plain. Gray jacket and skirt, neat as a flower.”\n\n“What you'd call expensively dressed?”\n\nThe Harvester hesitated.\n\n“What I'd call carefully dressed, but----but poverty poor, if you will\nhave it, Doc.”\n\nDoctor Carey's lips closed and then opened in sudden resolution.\n\n“David, I don't like it,” he said tersely.\n\nThe Harvester met his eye and purposely misunderstood him.\n\n“Neither do I!” he exclaimed. “I hate it! There is something wrong with\nthe whole world when a woman having a face full of purity, intellect,\nand refinement of extreme type glances around her like a hunted thing;\nwhen her appearance seems to indicate that she has starved her body to\nclothe it. I know what is in your mind, Doc, but if I were you I\nwouldn't put it into words, and I wouldn't even THINK it. Has it been\nyour experience in this world that women not fit to know skimp their\nbodies to cover them? Does a girl of light character and little brain\nhave the hardihood to advance a foot covered with a broken shoe? If I\ncould tell you that she rode in a Pullman, and wore exquisite clothing,\nyou would be doing something. The other side of the picture shuts you up\nlike a clam, and makes you appear shocked. Let me tell you this: No\nother woman I ever saw anywhere on God's footstool had a face of more\ndelicate refinement, eyes of purer intelligence. I am of the woods, and\nwhile they don't teach me how to shine in society, they do instil always\nand forever the fineness of nature and her ways. I have her lessons so\nwell learned they help me more than anything else to discern the\nqualities of human nature. If you are my friend, and have any faith at\nall in my common sense, get up and do something!”\n\nThe doctor arose promptly.\n\n“David, I'm an ass,” he said. “Unusually lop-eared, and blind in the\nbargain. But before I ask you to forgive me, I want you to remember two\nthings: First, she did not visit me in my dreams; and, second, I did not\nsee her in reality. I had nothing to judge from except what you\nsaid: you seemed reluctant to tell me, and what you did say\nwas----was----disturbing to a friend of yours. I have not the slightest\ndoubt if I had seen her I would agree with you. We seldom disagree,\nDavid. Now, will you forgive me?”\n\nThe Harvester suddenly faced a window. When at last he turned, “The\noffence lies with me,” he said, “I was hasty. Are you going to help me?”\n\n“With all my heart! Go home and work until your head clears, then come\nback in the morning. She did not come from Chicago for a day. You've\ndone all I know to do at present.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe went to Betsy and Belshazzar, and slowly drove up and down the\nstreets until Betsy protested and calmly turned homeward. The Harvester\nsmiled ruefully as he allowed her to proceed.\n\n“Go slow and take it easy,” he said as they reached the country. “I want\nto think.”\n\nBetsy stopped at the barn, the white doves took wing, and Ajax screamed\nshrilly before the Harvester aroused in the slightest to anything around\nhim. Then he looked at Belshazzar and said emphatically: “Now, partner,\ndon't ever again interfere when I am complying with the observances of\nmy religion. Just look what I'd have missed if I hadn't made good with\nthat order!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. TO LABOUR AND TO WAIT\n\n“We have reached the 'beginning of the end,' Ajax!” said the Harvester,\nas the peacock ceased screaming and came to seek food from his hand.\n“We have seen the Girl. Now we must locate her and convince her that\nMedicine Woods is her happy home. I feel quite equal to the latter\nproposition, Ajax, but how the nation to find her sticks me. I can't\nmake a search so open that she will know and resent it. She must have\nall the consideration ever paid the most refined woman, but she also\nhas got to be found, and that speedily. When I remember that look on her\nface, as if horrors were snatching at her skirts, it takes all the grit\nout of me. I feel weak as a sapling. And she needs all my strength. I've\nsimply got to brace up. I'll work a while and then perhaps I can think.”\n\nSo the Harvester began the evening routine. He thought he did not want\nanything to eat, but when he opened the cupboard and smelled the food he\nlearned that he was a hungry man and he cooked and ate a good supper. He\nput away everything carefully, for even the kitchen was dainty and fresh\nand he wanted to keep it so for her. When he finished he went into the\nliving-room, stood before the fireplace, and studied the collection of\nhalf-finished candlesticks grouped upon it. He picked up several and\nexamined them closely, but realized that he could not bind himself to\nthe exactions of carving that evening. He took a key from his pocket and\nunlocked her door. Every day he had been going there to improve upon his\nwork for her, and he loved the room, the outlook from its windows; he\nwas very proud of the furniture he had made. There was no paper-thin\ncovering on her chairs, bed, and dressing table. The tops, seats, and\nposts were solid wood, worth hundreds of dollars for veneer.\n\nTo-night he folded his arms and stood on the sill hesitating. While\nshe was a dream, he had loved to linger in her room. Now that she was\nreality, he paused. In one golden May day the place had become sacred.\nSince he had seen the Girl that room was so hers that he was hesitating\nabout entering because of this fact. It was as if the tall, slender form\nstood before the chest of drawers or sat at the dressing table and he\ndid not dare enter unless he were welcome. Softly he closed the door and\nwent away. He wandered to the dry-house and turned the bark and roots on\nthe trays, but the air stifled him and he hurried out. He tried to work\nin the packing room, but walls smothered him and again he sought the\nopen.\n\nHe espied a bundle of osier-bound, moss-covered ferns that he had found\nin the woods, and brought the shovel to transplant them; but the\nwork worried him, and he hurried through with it. Then he looked for\nsomething else to do and saw an ax. He caught it up and with lusty\nstrokes began swinging it. When he had chopped wood until he was very\ntired he went to bed. Sleep came to the strong, young frame and he awoke\nin the morning refreshed and hopeful.\n\nHe wondered why he had bothered Doctor Carey. The Harvester felt able\nthat morning to find his Dream Girl without assistance before the day\nwas over. It was merely a matter of going to the city and locating a\nwoman. Yesterday, it had been a question of whether she really existed.\nTo-day, he knew. Yesterday, it had meant a search possibly as wide\nas earth to find her. To-day, it was narrowed to only one location so\nsmall, compared with Chicago, that the Harvester felt he could sift\nits population with his fingers, and pick her from others at his first\nattempt. If she were visiting there probably she would rest during the\nnight, and be on the streets to-day.\n\nWhen he remembered her face he doubted it. He decided to spend part\nof the time on the business streets and the remainder in the residence\nportions of the city. Because it was uncertain when he would return,\neverything was fed a double portion, and Betsy was left at a livery\nstable with instructions to care for her until he came. He did not know\nwhere the search would lead him. For several hours he slowly walked the\nbusiness district and then ranged farther, but not a sight of her. He\nnever had known that Onabasha was so large. On its crowded streets he\ndid not feel that he could sift the population through his fingers, nor\ncould he open doors and search houses without an excuse.\n\nSome small boys passed him eating bananas, and the Harvester looked at\nhis watch and was amazed to find that the day had advanced until two\no'clock in the afternoon. He was tired and hungry. He went into a\nrestaurant and ordered lunch; as he waited a girl serving tables smiled\nat him. Any other time the Harvester would have returned at least a\npleasant look, and gone his way. To-day he scowled at her, and ate in\nhurried discomfort. On the streets again, he had no idea where to go and\nso he went to the hospital.\n\n“I expected you early this morning,” was the greeting of Doctor Carey.\n“Where have you been and what have you done?”\n\n“Nothing,” said the Harvester. “I was so sure she would be on the\nstreets I just watched, but I didn't see her.”\n\n“We will go to the depot,” said the doctor. “The first thing is to keep\nher from leaving town.”\n\nThey arranged with the ticket agents, expressmen, telegraphers, and, as\nthey left, the Harvester stopped and tipped the train caller, offering\nfurther reward worth while if he would find the Girl.\n\n“Now we will go to the police station,” said the doctor.\n\n“I'll see the chief and have him issue a general order to his men to\nwatch for her, but if I were you I'd select a half dozen in the down\ntown district, and give them a little tip with a big promise!”\n\n“Good Lord! How I hate this,” groaned the Harvester.\n\n“Want to find her by yourself?” questioned his friend.\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester, “I do! And I would, if it hadn't been for\nher ghastly face. That drives me to resort to any measures. The\nprobabilities are that she is lying sick somewhere, and if her comfort\ndepends on the purse that dressed her, she will suffer. Doc, do you know\nhow awful this is?”\n\n“I know that you've got a great imagination. If the woods make all men\nas sensitive as you are, those who have business to transact should stay\nout of them. Take a common-sense view. Look at this as I do. If she was\nstrong enough to travel in a day coach from Chicago; she can't be so\nvery ill to-day. Leaving life by the inch isn't that easy. She will be\nalive this time next year, whether you find her or not. The chances are\nthat her stress was mental anyway, and trouble almost never overcomes\nany one.”\n\n“You, a doctor and say that!”\n\n“Oh, I mean instantaneously----in a day! Of course if it grinds away\nfor years! But youth doesn't allow it to do that. It throws it off, and\ngrows hopeful and happy again. She won't die; put that out of your\nmind. If I were you I would go home now and go straight on with my work,\ntrusting to the machinery you have set in motion. I know most of the\nmen with whom we have talked. They will locate her in a week or less.\nIt's their business. It isn't yours. It's your job to be ready for her,\nand have enough ahead to support her when they find her. Try to realize\nthat there are now a dozen men on hunt for her, and trust them. Go back\nto your work, and I will come full speed in the motor when the first man\nsights her. That ought to satisfy you. I've told all of them to call me\nat the hospital, and I will tell my assistant what to do in case a call\ncomes while I am away. Straighten your face! Go back to Medicine Woods\nand harvest your crops, and before you know it she will be located. Then\nyou can put on your Sunday clothes and show yourself, and see if you can\nmake her take notice.”\n\n“Idiot!” exclaimed the Harvester, but he started home. When he arrived\nhe attended to his work and then sat down to think.\n\n“Doc is right,” was his ultimate conclusion. “She can't leave the city,\nshe can't move around in it, she can't go anywhere, without being seen.\nThere's one more point: I must tell Carey to post all the doctors to\nreport if they have such a call. That's all I can think of. I'll\ngo to-night, and then I'll look over the ginseng for parasites, and\nto-morrow I'll dive into the late spring growth and work until I haven't\ntime to think. I've let cranesbill get a week past me now, and it can't\nbe dispensed with.”\n\nSo the following morning, when the Harvester had completed his work at\nthe cabin and barn and breakfasted, he took a mattock and a big hempen\nbag, and followed the path to the top of the hill. As it ran along the\nlake bank he descended on the other side to several acres of cleared\nland, where he raised corn for his stock, potatoes, and coarser garden\ntruck, for which there was not space in the smaller enclosure close the\ncabin. Around the edges of these fields, and where one of them sloped\ntoward the lake, he began grubbing a variety of grass having tall stems\nalready over a foot in height at half growth. From each stem waved four\nor five leaves of six or eight inches length and the top showed forming\nclusters of tiny spikelets.\n\n“I am none too early for you,” he muttered to himself as he ran the\nmattock through the rich earth, lifting the long, tough, jointed root\nstalks of pale yellow, from every section of which broke sprays of fine\nrootlets. “None too early for you, and as you are worth only seven cents\na pound, you couldn't be considered a 'get-rich-quick' expedient, so\nI'll only stop long enough with you to gather what I think my customers\nwill order, and amass a fortune a little later picking mullein flowers\nat seventy-five cents a pound. What a crop I've got coming!”\n\nThe Harvester glanced ahead, where in the cleared soil of the bank grew\nlarge plants with leaves like yellow-green felt and tall bloom stems\nrising. Close them flourished other species requiring dry sandy soil,\nthat gradually changed as it approached the water until it became\ncovered with rank abundance of short, wiry grass, half the blades of\nwhich appeared red. Numerous everywhere he could see the grayish-white\nleaves of Parnassus grass. As the season advanced it would lift\nheart-shaped velvet higher, and before fall the stretch of emerald would\nbe starred with white-faced, green-striped flowers.\n\n“Not a prettier sight on earth,” commented the Harvester, “than just\nswale wire grass in September making a fine, thick background to set off\nthose delicate starry flowers on their slender stems. I must remember to\nbring her to see that.”\n\nHis eyes followed the growth to the water. As the grass drew closer\nmoisture it changed to the rank, sweet, swamp variety, then came\nbulrushes, cat-tails, water smartweed, docks, and in the water blue flag\nlifted folded buds; at its feet arose yellow lily leaves and farther out\nspread the white. As the light struck the surface the Harvester imagined\nhe could see the little green buds several inches below. Above all arose\nwild rice he had planted for the birds. The red wings swayed on the\nwillows and tilted on every stem that would bear their weight, singing\ntheir melodious half-chanted notes, “O-ka-lee!”\n\nBeneath them the ducks gobbled, splashed, and chattered; grebe and coot\nvoices could be distinguished; king rails at times flashed into sight\nand out again; marsh wrens scolded and chattered; occasionally a\nkingfisher darted around the lake shore, rolling his rattling cry and\nflashing his azure coat and gleaming white collar. On a hollow tree\nin the woods a yellow hammer proved why he was named, because he\ncarpentered industriously to enlarge the entrance to the home he was\nexcavating in a dead tree; and sailing over the lake and above the woods\nin grace scarcely surpassed by any, a lonesome turkey buzzard awaited\nhis mate's decision as to which hollow log was most suitable for their\nhome.\n\nThe Harvester stuffed the grass roots in the bag until it would hold no\nmore and stood erect to wipe his face, for the sun was growing warm. As\nhe drew his handkerchief across his brow, the south wind struck him with\nenough intensity to attract attention. Instantly the Harvester removed\nhis hat, rolled it up, and put it into his pocket. He stood an instant\ndelighting in the wind and then spoke.\n\n“Allow me to express my most fervent thanks for your kindness,” he said.\n“I thought probably you would take that message, since it couldn't mean\nmuch to you, and it meant all the world to me. I thought you would carry\nit, but, I confess, I scarcely expected the answer so soon. The only\nthing that could make me more grateful to you would be to know exactly\nwhere she is: but you must understand that it's like a peep into Heaven\nto have her existence narrowed to one place. I'm bound to be able to\nsay inside a few days, she lives at number----I don't know yet, on\nstreet----I'll find out soon, in the closest city, Onabasha. And I know\nwhy you brought her, South Wind. If ever a girl's cheeks need fanning\nwith your breezes, and painting with sun kisses, I wouldn't mind, since\nthis is strictly private, adding a few of mine; if ever any one needed\nflowers, birds, fresh air, water, and rest! Good Lord, South Wind, did\nyou ever reach her before you carried that message? I think not! But\nOnabasha isn't so large. You and the sun should get your innings there.\nI do hope she is not trying to work! I can attend to that; and so there\nwill be more time when she is found, I'd better hustle now.”\n\nHe picked up the bag and returned to the dry-house, where he carefully\nwashed the roots and spread them on the trays. Then he took the same\nbag and mattock and going through the woods in the opposite direction\nhe came to a heavy growth in a cleared space of high ground. The bloom\nheads were forming and the plant was half matured. The Harvester dug a\ncylindrical, tapering root, wrinkling lengthwise, wiped it clean, broke\nand tasted it. He made a wry face. He stood examining the white wood\nwith its brown-red bark and, deciding that it was in prime condition, he\nbegan digging the plants. It was common wayside “Bouncing Bet,” but the\nHarvester called it “soapwort.” He took every other plant in his way\nacross the bed, and when he digged a heavy load he carried it home,\nstripped the leaves, and spread them on trays, while the roots he\ntopped, washed, and put to dry also. Then he whistled for Belshazzar and\nwent to lunch.\n\nAs he passed down the road to the cabin his face was a study of\nconflicting emotions, and his eyes had a far away appearance of deep\nthought. Every tree of his stretch of forest was rustling fresh leaves\nto shelter him; dogwood, wild crab, and hawthorn offered their flowers;\nearth held up her tribute in painted trillium faces, spring beauties,\nand violets, blue, white, and yellow. Mosses, ferns, and lichen\ndecorated the path; all the birds greeted him in friendship, and\nsang their purest melodies. The sky was blue, the sun bright, the air\nperfumed for him; Belshazzar, always true to his name, protected every\nfootstep; Ajax, the shimmering green and gold wonder, came up the hill\nto meet him; the white doves circled above his head. Stumbling half\nblindly, the Harvester passed unheeding among them, and went into the\ncabin. When he came out he stood a long time in deep study, but at last\nhe returned to the woods.\n\n“Perhaps they will have found her before night,” he said. “I'll harvest\nthe cranesbill yet, because it's growing late for it, and then I'll see\nhow they are coming on. Maybe they'd know her if they met her, and maybe\nthey wouldn't. She may wear different clothing, and freshen up after her\ntrip. She might have been car sick, as Doc suggested, and appear very\ndifferent when she feels better.”\n\nHe skirted the woods around the northeast end and stopped at a big bed\nof exquisite growth. Tall, wiry stems sprang upward almost two feet in\nheight; leaves six inches across were cut in ragged lobes almost to the\nbase, and here and there, enough to colour the entire bed a delicate\nrose or sometimes a violet purple, the first flowers were unfolding. The\nHarvester lifted a root and tasted it.\n\n“No doubt about you being astringent,” he muttered. “You have enough\ntannin in you to pucker a mushroom. By the way, those big, corn-cobby\nfellows should spring up with the next warm rain, and the hotels and\nrestaurants always pay high prices. I must gather a few bushels.”\n\nHe looked over the bed of beautiful wild alum and hesitated.\n\n“I vow I hate to touch you,” he said. “You are a picture right now, and\nin a week you will be a miracle. It seems a shame to tear up a plant for\nits roots, just at flowering time, and I can't avoid breaking down half\nI don't take, getting the ones I do. I wish you were not so pretty! You\nare one of the colours I love most. You remind me of red-bud, blazing\nstar, and all those exquisite magenta shades that poets, painters, and\nthe Almighty who made them love so much they hesitate about using them\nlavishly. You are so delicate and graceful and so modest. I wish she\ncould see you! I got to stop this or I won't be able to lift a root. I\nnever would if the ten cents a pound I'll get out of it were the only\nconsideration.”\n\nThe Harvester gripped the mattock and advanced to the bed. “What I must\nbe thinking is that you are indispensable to the sick folks. The steady\ndemand for you proves your value, and of course, humanity comes first,\nafter all. If I remain in the woods alone much longer I'll get to the\nplace where I'm not so sure that it does. Seems as if animals, birds,\nflowers, trees, and insects as well, have their right to life also. But\nit's for me to remember the sick folks! If I thought the Girl would get\nsome of it now, I could overturn the bed with a stout heart. If any one\never needed a tonic, I think she does. Maybe some of this will reach\nher. If it does, I hope it will make her cheeks just the lovely pink of\nthe bloom. Oh Lord! If only she hadn't appeared so sick and frightened!\nWhat is there in all this world of sunshine to make a girl glance around\nher like that? I wish I knew! Maybe they will have found her by night.”\n\nThe Harvester began work on the bed, but he knelt and among the damp\nleaves from the spongy black earth he lifted the roots with his fingers\nand carefully straightened and pressed down the plants he did not take.\nThis required more time than usual, but his heart was so sore he could\nnot be rough with anything, most of all a flower. So he harvested the\nwild alum by hand, and heaped large stacks of roots around the edges of\nthe bed. Often he paused as he worked and on his knees stared through\nthe forest as if he hoped perhaps she would realize his longing for her,\nand come to him in the wood as she had across the water. Over and\nover he repeated, “Perhaps they will find her by night!” and that so\nintensified the meaning that once he said it aloud. His face clouded and\ngrew dark.\n\n“Dealish nice business!” he said. “I am here in the woods digging flower\nroots, and a gang of men in the city are searching for the girl I love.\nIf ever a job seemed peculiarly a man's own, it appears this would be.\nWhat business has any other man spying after my woman? Why am I not down\nthere doing my own work, as I always have done it? Who's more likely to\nfind her than I am? It seems as if there would be an instinct that\nwould lead me straight to her, if I'd go. And you can wager I'll go fast\nenough.”\n\nThe Harvester appeared as if he would start that instant, but with lips\nclosely shut he finally forced himself to go on with his work. When he\nhad rifled the bed, and uprooted all he cared to take during one season,\nhe carried the roots to the lake shore below the curing house, and\nspread them on a platform he had built. He stepped into his boat and\nbegan dashing pails of water over them and using a brush. As he worked\nhe washed away the woody scars of last year's growth, and the tiny buds\nappearing for the coming season.\n\nBelshazzar sat on the opposite bank and watched the operation; and Ajax\ncame down and, flying to a dead stump, erected and slowly waved his\ntrain to attract the sober-faced man who paid no heed. He left the roots\nto drain while he prepared supper, then placed them on the trays, now\nfilled to overflowing, and was glad he had finished. He could not cure\nanything else at present if he wanted to. He was as far advanced as he\nhad been at the same time the previous year. Then he dressed neatly and\nlocking the Girl's room, and leaving Belshazzar to protect it, he went\nto Onabasha.\n\n“Bravo!” cried Doctor Carey as the Harvester entered his office. “You\nare heroic to wait all day for news. How much stuff have you gathered?”\n\n“Three crops. How many missing women have you located?”\n\nThe doctor laughed. There was no sign of a smile on the face of the\nHarvester.\n\n“You didn't really expect her to come to light the first day? That would\nbe too easy! We can't find her in a minute.”\n\n“It will be no surprise to me if you can't find her at all. I am not\nexpecting another man to do what I don't myself.”\n\n“You are not hunting her. You are harvesting the woods. The men you\nemploy are to find her.”\n\n“Maybe I am, and maybe I am not,” said the Harvester slowly. “To me\nit appears to be a poor stick of a man who coolly proceeds with money\nmaking, and trusts to men who haven't even seen her to search for the\ngirl he loves. I think a few hours of this is about all my patience will\nendure.”\n\n“What are you going to do?”\n\n“I don't know,” said the Harvester. “But you can bank on one thing\nsure----I'm going to do something! I've had my fill of this. Thank you\nfor all you've done, and all you are going to do. My head is not clear\nenough yet to decide anything with any sense, but maybe I'll hit on\nsomething soon. I'm for the streets for a while.”\n\n“Better go home and go to bed. You seem very tired.”\n\n“I am,” said the Harvester. “The only way to endure this is to work\nmyself down. I'm all right, and I'll be careful, but I rather think I'll\nfind her myself.”\n\n“Better go on with your work as we planned.”\n\n“I'll think about it,” said the Harvester as he went out.\n\nUntil he was too tired to walk farther he slowly paced the streets of\nthe city, and then followed the home road through the valley and up the\nhill to Medicine Woods. When he came to Singing Water, Belshazzar heard\nhis steps on the bridge, and came bounding to meet him. The Harvester\nstretched himself on a seat and turned his face to the sky. It was a\ndeep, dark-blue bowl, closely set with stars, and a bright moon shed a\nsoft May radiance on the young earth. The lake was flooded with light,\nand the big trees of the forest crowning the hill were silver coroneted.\nThe unfolding leaves had hidden the new cabin from the bridge, but the\ndriveway shone white, and already the upspringing bushes hedged it in.\nInsects were humming lazily in the perfumed night air, and across the\nlake a courting whip-poor-will was explaining to his sweetheart just\nhow much and why he loved her. A few bats were wavering in air hunting\ninsects, and occasionally an owl or a nighthawk crossed the lake.\nKilldeer were glorying in the moonlight and night flight, and cried in\npure, clear notes as they sailed over the water. The Harvester was tired\nand filled with unrest as he stretched on the bridge, but the longer\nhe lay the more the enfolding voices comforted him. All of them were\nwaiting and working out their lives to the legitimate end; there was\nnothing else for him to do. He need not follow instinct or profit by\nchance. He was a man; he could plan and reason.\n\nThe air grew balmy and some big, soft clouds swept across the moon. The\nHarvester felt the dampness of rising dew, and went to the cabin. He\nlooked at it long in the moonlight and told himself that he could see\nhow much the plants, vines, and ferns had grown since the previous\nnight. Without making a light, he threw himself on the bed in the\noutdoor room, and lay looking through the screening at the lake and sky.\nHe was working his brain to think of some manner in which to start a\nsearch for the Dream Girl that would have some probability of success to\nrecommend it, but he could settle on no feasible plan. At last he fell\nasleep, and in the night soft rain wet his face. He pulled an oilcloth\nsheet over the bed, and lay breathing deeply of the damp, perfumed air\nas he again slept. In the morning brilliant sunshine awoke him and he\narose to find the earth steaming.\n\n“If ever there was a perfect mushroom day!” he said to Belshazzar. “We\nmust hurry and feed the stock and ourselves and gather some. They mean\nreal money.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE QUEST OF THE DREAM GIRL\n\nThe Harvester breakfasted, fed the stock, hitched Betsy to the spring\nwagon, and went into the dripping, steamy woods. If anyone had asked him\nthat morning concerning his idea of Heaven, he never would have dreamed\nof describing a place of gold-paved streets, crystal pillars, jewelled\ngates, and thrones of ivory. These things were beyond the man's\ncomprehension and he would not have admired or felt at home in such\nmagnificence if it had been materialized for him. He would have told\nyou that a floor of last year's brown leaves, studded with myriad flower\nfaces, big, bark-encased pillars of a thousand years, jewels on every\nbush, shrub, and tree, and tilting thrones on which gaudy birds almost\nburst themselves to voice the joy of life, while their bright-eyed\nlittle mates peered questioningly at him over nest rims----he would have\ntold you that Medicine Woods on a damp, sunny May morning was Heaven.\nAnd he would have added that only one angel, tall and slender, with the\npink of health on her cheeks and the dew of happiness in her dark eyes,\nwas necessary to enter and establish glory. Everything spoke to him that\nmorning, but the Harvester was silent. It had been his habit to talk\nconstantly to Belshazzar, Ajax, his work, even the winds and perfumes;\nit had been his method of dissipating solitude, but to-day he had no\nwords, even for these dear friends. He only opened his soul to beauty,\nand steadily climbed the hill to the crest, and then down the other side\nto the rich, half-shaded, half-open spaces, where big, rough mushrooms\nsprang in a night similar to the one just passed.\n\nHe could see them awaiting him from afar. He began work with rapid\nfingers, being careful to break off the heads, but not to pull up the\nroots. When four heaping baskets were filled he cut heavily leaved\nbranches to spread over them, and started to Onabasha. As usual,\nBelshazzar rode beside him and questioned the Harvester when he politely\nsuggested to Betsy that she make a little haste.\n\n“Have you forgotten that mushrooms are perishable?” he asked. “If we\ndon't get these to the city all woodsy and fresh we can't sell them.\nWonder where we can do the best? The hotels pay well. Really, the\nbiggest prices could be had by----”\n\nThen the Harvester threw back his head and began to laugh, and\nhe laughed, and he laughed. A crow on the fence Joined him, and a\nkingfisher, heading for Loon Lake, and then Belshazzar caught the\ninfection.\n\n“Begorry! The very idea!” cried the Harvester. “'Heaven helps them\nthat help themselves.' Now you just watch us manoeuvre for assistance,\nBelshazzar, old boy! Here we go!”\n\nThen the laugh began again. It continued all the way to Onabasha and\neven into the city. The Harvester drove through the most prosperous\nstreet until he reached the residence district. At the first home\nhe stopped, gave the lines to Belshazzar, and, taking a basket of\nmushrooms, went up the walk and rang the bell.\n\n“All groceries should be delivered at the back door,” snapped a pert\nmaid, before he had time to say a word.\n\nThe Harvester lifted his hat.\n\n“Will you kindly tell the lady of the house that I wish to speak with\nher?”\n\n“What name, please?”\n\n“I want to show her some fine mushrooms, freshly gathered,” he answered.\n\nHow she did it the Harvester never knew. The first thing he realized was\nthat the door had closed before his face, and the basket had been picked\ndeftly from his fingers and was on the other side. After a short time\nthe maid returned.\n\n“What do you want for them, please?”\n\nThe last thing on earth the Harvester wanted to do was to part with\nthose mushrooms, so he took one long, speculative look down the hall and\nnamed a price he thought would be prohibitive.\n\n“One dollar a dozen.”\n\n“How many are there?”\n\n“I count them as I sell them. I do not know.”\n\nThe door closed again. Presently it opened and the maid knelt on the\nfloor before him and counted the mushrooms one by one into a dish pan\nand in a few minutes brought back seven dollars and fifty cents. The\nchagrined Harvester, feeling like a thief, put the money in his pocket,\nand turned away.\n\n“I was to tell you,” said she, “that you are to bring all you have to\nsell here, and the next time please go to the kitchen door.”\n\n“Must be fond of mushrooms,” said the disgruntled Harvester.\n\n“They are a great delicacy, and there are visitors.” The Harvester ached\nto set the girl to one side and walk through the house, but he did not\ndare; so he returned to the street, whistled to Betsy to come, and went\nto the next gate. Here he hesitated. Should he risk further snubbing at\nthe front door or go back at once. If he did, he only would see a maid.\nAs he stood an instant debating, the door of the house he just had\nleft opened and the girl ran after him. “If you have more, we will take\nthem,” she called.\n\nThe Harvester gasped for breath.\n\n“They have to be used at once,” he suggested.\n\n“She knows that. She wants to treat her friends.”\n\n“Well she has got enough for a banquet,” he said. “I--I don't usually\nsell more than a dozen or two in one place.”\n\n“I don't see why you can't let her have them if you have more.”\n\n“Perhaps I have orders to fill for regular customers,” suggested the\nHarvester.\n\n“And perhaps you haven't,” said the maid. “You ought to be ashamed not\nto let people who are willing to pay your outrageous prices have them.\nIt's regular highway robbery.”\n\n“Possibly that's the reason I decline to hold up one party twice,” said\nthe Harvester as he entered the gate and went up the walk to the front\ndoor.\n\n“You should be taught your place,” called the maid after him.\n\nThe Harvester again rang the bell. Another maid opened the door, and\nonce more he asked to speak with the lady of the house. As the girl\nturned, a handsome old woman in cap and morning gown came down the\nstairs.\n\n“What have you there?” she asked.\n\nThe Harvester lifted the leaves and exposed the musky, crimpled, big\nmushrooms.\n\n“Oh!” she cried in delight. “Indeed, yes! We are very fond of them. I\nwill take the basket, and divide with my sons. You are sure you have no\npoisonous ones among them?”\n\n“Quite sure,” said the Harvester faintly.\n\n“How much do you want for the basket?”\n\n“They are a dollar a dozen; I haven't counted them.”\n\n“Dear me! Isn't that rather expensive?”\n\n“It is. Very!” said the Harvester. “So expensive that most people don't\nthink of taking over a dozen. They are large and very rich, so they go a\nlong way.”\n\n“I suppose you have to spend a great deal of time hunting them? It does\nseem expensive, but they are fresh, and the boys are so fond of them.\nI'm not often extravagant, I'll just take the lot. Sarah, bring a pan.”\n\nAgain the Harvester stood and watched an entire basket counted over and\ncarried away, and he felt the robber he had been called as he took the\nmoney.\n\nAt the next house he had learned a lesson. He carpeted a basket with\nleaves and counted out a dozen and a half into it, leaving the remainder\nin the wagon. Three blocks on one side of the street exhausted his\nstore and he was showered with orders. He had not seen any one that even\nresembled a dark-eyed girl. As he came from the last house a big, red\nmotor shot past and then suddenly slowed and backed beside his wagon.\n\n“What in the name of sense are you doing?” demanded Doctor Carey.\n\n“Invading the residence district of Onabasha,” said the Harvester.\n“Madam, would you like some nice, fresh, country mushrooms? I guarantee\nthat there are no poisonous ones among them, and they were gathered this\nmorning. Considering their rarity and the difficult work of collecting,\nthey are exceedingly low at my price. I am offering these for five\ndollars a dozen, madam, and for mercy sake don't take them or I'll have\nno excuse to go to the next house.”\n\nThe doctor stared, then understood, and began to laugh. When at last he\ncould speak he said, “David, I'll bet you started with three bushels and\nbegan at the head of this street, and they are all gone.”\n\n“Put up a good one!” said the Harvester. “You win. The first house I\ntried they ordered me to the back door, took a market basket full away\nfrom me by force, tried to buy the load, and I didn't see any one save a\nmaid.”\n\nThe doctor lay on the steering gear and faintly groaned.\n\nThe Harvester regarded him sympathetically. “Isn't it a crime?” he\nquestioned. “Mushrooms are no go. I can see that!----or rather they are\nentirely too much of a go. I never saw anything in such demand. I must\nseek a less popular article for my purpose. To-morrow look out for me.\nI shall begin where I left off to-day, but I will have changed my\nproduct.”\n\n“David, for pity sake,” peeped the doctor.\n\n“What do I care how I do it, so I locate her?” superbly inquired the\nHarvester.\n\n“But you won't find her!” gasped the doctor.\n\n“I've come as close it as you so far, anyway,” said the Harvester. “Your\nmushrooms are on the desk in your office.”\n\nHe drove slowly up and down the streets until Betsy wabbled on her legs.\nThen he left her to rest and walked until he wabbled; and by that time\nit was dark, so he went home.\n\nAt the first hint of dawn he was at work the following morning. With\nloaded baskets closely covered, he started to Onabasha, and began where\nhe had quit the day before. This time he carried a small, crudely\nfashioned bark basket, leaf-covered, and he rang at the front door with\nconfidence.\n\nEvery one seemed to have a maid in that part of the city, for a freshly\ncapped and aproned girl opened the door.\n\n“Are there any young women living here?” blandly inquired the Harvester.\n\n“What's that of your business?” demanded the maid.\n\nThe Harvester flushed, but continued, “I am offering something\nespecially intended for young women. If there are none, I will not\ntrouble you.”\n\n“There are several.”\n\n“Will you please ask them if they would care for bouquets of violets,\nfresh from the woods?”\n\n“How much are they, and how large are the bunches?”\n\n“Prices differ, and they are the right size to appear well. They had\nbetter see for themselves.”\n\nThe maid reached for the basket, but the Harvester drew back.\n\n“I keep them in my possession,” he said. “You may take a sample.”\n\nHe lifted the leaves and drew forth a medium-sized bunch of long-stemmed\nblue violets with their leaves. The flowers were fresh, crisp, and\nstrong odours of the woods arose from them.\n\n“Oh!” cried the maid. “Oh, how lovely!”\n\nShe hurried away with them and returned carrying a purse.\n\n“I want two more bunches,” she said. “How much are they?”\n\n“Are the girls who want them dark or fair?”\n\n“What difference does that make?”\n\n“I have blue violets for blondes, yellow for brunettes, and white for\nthe others.”\n\n“Well I never! One is fair, and two have brown hair and blue eyes.”\n\n“One blue and two whites,” said the Harvester calmly, as if matching\nwomen's hair and eyes with flowers were an inherited vocation. “They are\ntwenty cents a bunch.”\n\n“Aha!” he chortled to himself as he whistled to Betsy. “At last we have\nit. There are no dark-eyed girls here. Now we are making headway.”\n\nDown the street he went, with varying fortune, but with patience and\npersistence at every house he at last managed to learn whether there was\na dark-eyed girl. There did not seem to be many. Long before his store\nof yellow violets was gone the last blue and white had disappeared. But\nhe calmly went on asking for dark-eyed girls, and explaining that all\nthe blue and white were taken, because fair women were most numerous.\n\nAt one house the owner, who reminded the Harvester of his mother,\ncame to the door. He uncovered and in his suavest tones inquired if\na brunette young woman lived there and if she would like a nosegay of\nyellow violets.\n\n“Well bless my soul!” cried she. “What is this world coming to? Do\nyou mean to tell me that there are now able-bodied men offering at our\ndoors, flowers to match our girls' complexions?”\n\n“Yes madam?” said the Harvester gravely, “and also selling them as fast\nas he can show them, at prices that make a profit very well worth while.\nI had an equal number of blue and white, but I see the dark girls are\nvery much in the minority. The others were gone long ago, and I now have\nflowers to offer brunettes only.”\n\n“Well forever more! And you don't call that fiddlin' business for a big,\nhealthy, young man?”\n\nThe Harvester's gay laugh was infectious.\n\n“I do not,” he said. “I have to start as soon as I can see, tramp long\ndistances in wet woods and gather the violets on my knees, make them\ninto bunches, and bring them here in water to keep them fresh. I have\nanother occupation. I only kill time on these, but I would be ashamed to\ntell you what I have gotten for them this morning.”\n\n“Humph! I'm glad to hear it!” said the woman. “Shame in some form is a\nsign of grace. I have no use for a human being without a generous supply\nof it. There is a very beautiful dark-eyed girl in the house, and I will\ntake two bunches for her. How much are they?”\n\n“I have only three remaining,” said the Harvester. “Would you like to\nallow her to make her own selection?”\n\n“When I'm giving things I usually take my choice. I want that, and that\none.”\n\n“As my stock is so nearly out, I'll make the two for twenty,” said the\nHarvester. “Won't you accept the last one from me, because you remind me\njust a little of my mother?”\n\n“I will indeed,” said she. “Thank you very much! I shall love to have\nthem as dearly as any of the girls. I used to gather them when I was a\nchild, but I almost never see the blue ones any more, and I don't know\nas I ever expected to see a yellow violet again as long as I live. Where\ndid you get them?”\n\n“In my woods,” said the Harvester. “You see I grow several members of\nthe viola pedata family, bird's foot, snake, and wood violet, and three\nof the odorata, English, marsh, and sweet, for our big drug houses. They\nuse the flowers in making delicate tests for acids and alkalies.\nThe entire plant, flower, seed, leaf, and root, goes into different\nremedies. The beds seed themselves and spread, so I have more than\nI need for the chemists, and I sell a few. I don't use the white and\nyellow in my business; I just grow them for their beauty. I also sell my\nsurplus lilies of the valley. Would you like to order some of them for\nyour house or more violets for to-morrow?”\n\n“Well bless my soul! Do you mean to tell me that lilies of the valley\nare medicine?”\n\nThe Harvester laughed.\n\n“I grow immense beds of them in the woods on the banks of Loon Lake,”\n he said. “They are the convallaris majallis of the drug houses and I\nscarcely know what the weak-hearted people would do without them. I use\nlarge quantities in trade, and this season I am selling a few because\npeople so love them.”\n\n“Lilies in medicine; well dear me! Are roses good for our innards too?”\n\nThen the Harvester did laugh.\n\n“I imagine the roses you know go into perfumes mostly,” he answered.\n“They do make medicine of Canadian rock rose and rose bay, laurel, and\nwillow. I grow the bushes, but they are not what you would consider\nroses.”\n\n“I wonder now,” said the woman studying the Harvester closely, “if you\nare not that queer genius I've heard of, who spends his time hunting and\ngrowing stuff in the woods and people call him the Medicine Man.”\n\n“I strongly suspect madam, I am that man,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Well bless me!” cried she. “I've always wanted to see you and here when\nI do, you look just like anybody else. I thought you'd have long hair,\nand be wild-eyed and ferocious. And your talk sounds like out of a book.\nWell that beats me!”\n\n“Me too!” said the Harvester, lifting his hat. “You don't want any\nlilies to-morrow, then?”\n\n“Yes I do. Medicine or no medicine, I've always liked 'em, and I'm going\nto keep on liking them. If you can bring me a good-sized bunch after the\nweak-kneed----”\n\n“Weak-hearted,” corrected the Harvester.\n\n“Well 'weak-hearted,' then; it's all the same thing. If you've got any\nleft, as I was saying, you can fetch them to me for the smell.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed all the way down town. There he went to Doctor\nCarey's office, examined a directory, and got the names of all the\nnumbers where he had sold yellow violets. A few questions when the\ndoctor came in settled all of them, but the flower scheme was better.\nBecause the yellow were not so plentiful as the white and blue, next day\nhe added buttercups and cowslips to his store for the dark girls. When\nhe had rifled his beds for the last time, after three weeks of almost\ndaily trips to town, and had paid high prices to small boys he set\nsearching the adjoining woods until no more flowers could be found, he\ndrove from the outskirts of the city one day toward the hospital, and as\nhe stopped, down the street came Doctor Carey frantically waving to him.\nAs the big car slackened, “Come on David, quick! I've seen her!” cried\nthe doctor.\n\nThe Harvester jumped from the wagon, threw the lines to Belshazzar, and\nlanded in the panting car.\n\n“For Heaven's sake where? Are you sure?”\n\nThe car went speeding down the street. A policeman beckoned and cried\nafter it.\n\n“It won't do any good to get arrested, Doc,” cautioned the Harvester.\n\n“Now right along here,” panted Doctor Carey. “Watch both sides sharply.\nIf I stop you jump out, and tell the blame policemen to get at their\njob. The party they are hired to find is right under their noses.”\n\nThe Harvester began to perspire. “Doc, don't you think you should tell\nme? Maybe she is in some store. Maybe I could do better on foot.”\n\n“Shut up!” growled the doctor. “I am doing the best I know.”\n\nHe hurried up the street for blocks and back again, and at last stopped\nbefore a large store and went in. When he returned he drove to the\nhospital and together they entered the office. There he turned to the\nHarvester.\n\n“It isn't so hard to understand you now, my boy,” he said. “Shades of\nDiana, but she'll be a beauty when she gets a little more flesh and\ncolour. She came out of Whitlaw's and walked right to the crossing. I\nalmost could have touched her, but I didn't notice. Two girls passed\nbefore me, and in hurrying, a tall, dark one knocked off one of your\nbunches of yellow violets. She glanced at it and laughed, but let\nit lay. Then your girl hesitated stooped and picked it up. The crazy\npoliceman yelled at me to clear the crossing and it didn't hit me for a\nhalf block how tall and white she was and how dark her eyes were. I was\njust thinking about her picking up the flowers, and that it was queer\nfor her to do it, when like a brick it hit me, THAT'S DAVID'S GIRL! I\ntried to turn around, but you know what Main Street is in the middle\nof the day. And those idiots of policemen! They ordered me on, and I\ncouldn't turn for a street car coming, so I called to one of them that\nthe girl we wanted was down the street, and he looked at me like an\naddle-pate and said, 'What girl? Move on or you'll get in a jam here.'\nYou can use me for a football if I don't go back and smash him. Paid him\nfive dollars myself less than two weeks ago to keep his eyes open. 'TO\nKEEP HIS EYES OPEN!'” panted the doctor, shaking his fist at David. “Yes\nsir! 'To keep his eyes open!' And he motioned for things to come along,\nand so I lost her too.”\n\n“I think we had better go back to the street,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Oh, I'd been back and forth along that street for nearly an hour before\nI gave up and came here to see if I could find you, and we've hunted it\nan hour more! What's the use? She's gone for this time, but by gum, I\nsaw her! And she was worth seeing!”\n\n“Did she appear ill to you?”\n\nThe doctor dropped on a chair and threw out his hands hopelessly.\n\n“This was awful sudden, David,” he said. “I was going along as I told\nyou, and I noticed her stop and thought she had a good head to wait a\nsecond instead of running in before me, and there came those two girls\nright under the car from the other side. I only had a glimpse of her as\nshe stooped for the flowers. I saw a big braid of hair, but I was half a\nblock away before I got it all connected, and then came the crush in the\nstreet, and I was blocked.”\n\nThe doctor broke down and wiped his face and expressed his feelings\nunrestrainedly.\n\n“Don't!” said the Harvester patiently. “It's no use to feel so badly,\nDoc. I know what you would give to have found her for me. I know you did\nall you could. I let her escape me. We will find her yet. It's glorious\nnews that she's in the city. It gives me heart to hear that. Can't you\njust remember if she seemed ill?”\n\nThe doctor meditated.\n\n“She wasn't the tallest girl I ever saw,” he said slowly, “but she was\nthe tallest girl to be pretty. She had on a white waist and a gray skirt\nand black hat. Her eyes and hair were like you said, and she was plain,\nwhite faced, with a hue that might possibly be natural, and it might be\nconfinement in bad light and air and poor food. She didn't seem sick,\nbut she isn't well. There is something the matter with her, but it's not\nimmediate or dangerous. She appeared like a flower that had got a little\nmoisture and sprouted in a cellar.”\n\n“You saw her all right!” said the Harvester, “and I think your diagnosis\nis correct too. That's the way she seemed to me. I've thought she needed\nsun and air. I told the South Wind so the other day.”\n\n“Why you blame fool!” cried the doctor. “Is this thing going to your\nhead? Say, I forgot! There is something else. I traced her in the store.\nShe was at the embroidery counter and she bought some silk. If she ever\ncomes again the clerk is going to hold her and telephone me or get her\naddress if she has to steal it. Oh, we are getting there! We will have\nher pretty soon now. You ought to feel better just to know that she is\nin town and that I've seen her.”\n\n“I do!” said the Harvester. “Indeed I do!”\n\n“It can't be much longer,” said the doctor. “She's got to be located\nsoon. But those policemen! I wouldn't give a nickel for the lot! I'll\nbet she's walked over them for two weeks. If I were you I'd discharge\nthe bunch. They'd be peacefully asleep if she passed them. If they'd let\nme alone, I'd have had her. I could have turned around easily. I've been\nin dozens of closer places.”\n\n“Don't worry! This can't last much longer. She's of and in the city or\nshe wouldn't have picked up the flowers. Doc, are you sure they were\nmine?”\n\n“Yes. Half the girls have been tricked out in yours the past two weeks.\nI can spot them as far as I can see.”\n\n“Dear Lord, that's getting close!” said the Harvester intensely. “Seems\nas if the violets would tell her.”\n\n“Now cut out flowers talking and the South Wind!” ordered the doctor.\n“This is business. The violets prove something all right, though. If she\nwas in the country, she could gather plenty herself. She is working at\nsewing in some room in town, either over a store or in a house. If she\nhadn't been starved for flowers she never would have stopped for them on\nthe street. I could see just a flash of hesitation, but she wanted them\ntoo much. David, one bouquet will go in water and be cared for a week.\nMan, it's getting close! This does seem like a link.”\n\n“Since you say it, possibly I dare agree with you,” said the Harvester.\n\n“How near are you through with that canvass of yours?”\n\n“About three fourths.”\n\n“Well I'd go on with it. After all we have got to find her ourselves.\nThose senile policemen!”\n\n“I am going on with it; you needn't worry about that. But I've got to\nchange to other flowers. I've stripped the violet beds. There's quite\na crop of berries coming, but they are not ripe yet, and a tragedy to\npick. The pond lilies are just beginning to open by the thousand. The\nlake border is blue with sweet-flag that is lovely and the marsh pale\ngold with cowslips. The ferns are prime and the woods solid sheets of\nevery colour of bloom. I believe I'll go ahead with the wild flowers.”\n\n“I would too! David, you do feel better, don't you?”\n\n“I certainly do, Doctor. Surely it won't be long now!”\n\nThe Harvester was so hopeful that he whistled and sang on the return to\nMedicine Woods, and that night for the first time in many days he sat\nlong over a candlestick, and took a farewell peep into her room before\nhe went to bed.\n\nThe next day he worked with all his might harvesting the last remnants\nof early spring herbs, in the dry-room and store-house, and on furniture\nand candlesticks.\n\nThen he went back to flower gathering and every day offered bunches of\nexquisite wood and field flowers and white and gold water lilies from\ndoor to door.\n\nThree weeks later the Harvester, perceptibly thin, pale, and worried\nentered the office. He sank into a chair and groaned wearily.\n\n“Isn't this the bitterest luck!” he cried. “I've finished the town. I've\nalmost walked off my legs. I've sold flowers by the million, but I've\nnot had a sight of her.”\n\n“It's been almost a tragedy with me,” said the doctor gloomily. “I've\nkilled two dogs and grazed a baby, because I was watching the sidewalks\ninstead of the street. What are you going to do now?”\n\n“I am going home and bring up the work to the July mark. I am going to\ntake it easy and rest a few days so I can think more clearly. I don't\nknow what I'll try next. I've punched up the depot and the policemen\nagain. When I get something new thought out I'll let you know.”\n\nThen he began emptying his pockets of money and heaping it on the table,\nsmall coins, bills, big and little.\n\n“What on earth is that?”\n\n“That,” said the Harvester, giving the heap a shove of contempt, “that\nis the price of my pride and humiliation. That is what it cost people\nwho allowed me to cheek my way into their homes and rob them, as one\nmaid said, for my own purposes. Doc, where on earth does all the money\ncome from? In almost every house I entered, women had it to waste, in\nmany cases to throw away. I never saw so much paid for nothing in all my\nlife. That whole heap is from mushrooms and flowers.”\n\n“What are you piling it there for?”\n\n“For your free ward. I don't want a penny of it. I wouldn't keep it, not\nif I was starving.”\n\n“Why David! You couldn't compel any one to buy. You offered something\nthey wanted, and they paid you what you asked.”\n\n“Yes, and to keep them from buying, and to make the stuff go farther, I\nnamed prices to shame a shark. When I think of that mushroom deal I can\nfeel my face burn. I've made the search I wanted to, and I am satisfied\nthat I can't find her that way. I have kept up my work at home between\ntimes. I am not out anything but my time, and it isn't fair to plunder\nthe city to pay that. Take that cussed money and put it where I'll never\nsee or hear of it. Do anything you please, except to ask me ever to\nprofit by a cent. When I wash my hands after touching it for the last\ntime maybe I'll feel better.”\n\n“You are a fanatic!”\n\n“If getting rid of that is being a fanatic, I am proud of the title. You\ncan't imagine what I've been through!”\n\n“Can't I though?” laughed the doctor. “In work of that kind you get into\nevery variety of place; and some of it is new to you. Never mind! No one\ncan contaminate you. It is the law that only a man can degrade himself.\nKnowing things will not harm you. Doing them is a different matter. What\nyou know will be a protection. What you do ruins----if it is wrong. You\nare not harmed, you are only disgusted. Think it over, and in a few days\ncome back and get your money. It is strictly honest. You earned every\ncent of it.”\n\n“If you ever speak of it again or force it on me I'll take it home and\nthrow it into the lake.”\n\nHe went after Betsy and slowly drove to Medicine Woods. Belshazzar,\non the seat beside him, recognized a silent, disappointed master\nand whimpered as he rubbed the Harvester's shoulder to attract his\nattention.\n\n“This is tough luck, old boy,” said the Harvester. “I had such hopes and\nI worked so hard. I suffered in the flesh for every hour of it, and I\nfailed. Oh but I hate the word! If I knew where she is right now, Bel,\nI'd give anything I've got. But there's no use to wail and get sorry\nfor myself. That's against the law of common decency. I'll take a swim,\nsleep it off, straighten up the herbs a little, and go at it again, old\nfellow; that's a man's way. She's somewhere, and she's got to be found,\nno matter what it costs.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. BELSHAZZAR'S RECORD POINT\n\nThe Harvester set the neglected cabin in order; then he carefully and\ndeftly packed all his dried herbs, barks, and roots. Next came carrying\nthe couch grass, wild alum, and soapwort into the store-room. Then\nfollowed July herbs. He first went to his beds of foxglove, because\nthe tender leaves of the second year should be stripped from them at\nflowering time, and that usually began two weeks earlier; but his bed\nlay in a shaded, damp location and the tall bloom stalks were only in\nhalf flower, their pale lavender making an exquisite picture. It paid\nto collect those leaves, so the Harvester hastily stripped the amount he\nwanted.\n\nYarrow was beginning to bloom and he gathered as much as he required,\ntaking the whole plant. That only brought a few cents a pound, but it\nwas used entire, so the weight made it worth while.\n\nCatnip tops and leaves were also ready. As it grew in the open in dry\nsoil and the beds had been weeded that spring, he could gather great\narm loads of it with a sickle, but he had to watch the swarming bees. He\nleft the male fern and mullein until the last for different reasons.\n\nOn the damp, cool, rocky hillside, beneath deep shade of big forest\ntrees, grew the ferns, their long, graceful fronds waving softly. Tree\ntoads sang on the cool rocks beneath them, chewinks nested under gnarled\nroots among them, rose-breasted grosbeaks sang in grape-vines clambering\nover the thickets, and Singing Water ran close beside. So the Harvester\nleft digging these roots until nearly the last, because he so disliked\nto disturb the bed. He could not have done it if he had not been forced.\nAll of the demand for his fern never could be supplied. Of his products\nnone was more important to the Harvester because this formed the basis\nof one of the oldest and most reliable remedies for little children. The\nfern had to be gathered with especial care, deteriorated quickly, and no\nstaple was more subject to adulteration.\n\nSo he kept his bed intact, lifted the roots at the proper time,\ncarefully cleaned without washing, rapidly dried in currents of hot\nair, and shipped them in bottles to the trade. He charged and received\nfifteen cents a pound, where careless and indifferent workers got ten.\n\nOn the banks of Singing Water, at the head of the fern bed, the\nHarvester stood under a gray beech tree and looked down the swaying\nlength of delicate green. He was lean and rapidly bronzing, for he\nseldom remembered a head covering because he loved the sweep of the wind\nin his hair.\n\n“I hate to touch you,” he said. “How I wish she could see you before I\nbegin. If she did, probably she would say it was a sin, and then I never\ncould muster courage to do it at all. I'd give a small farm to know\nif those violets revived for her. I was crazy to ask Doc if they were\nwilted, but I hated to. If they were from the ones I gathered that\nmorning they should have been all right.”\n\nA tree toad dared him to come on; a chipmunk grew saucy as the Harvester\nbent to an unloved task. If he stripped the bed as closely as he dared\nand not injure it, he could not fill half his orders; so, deftly and\nwith swift, skilful fingers and an earnest face, he worked. Belshazzar\ncame down the hill on a rush, nose to earth and began hunting among the\nplants. He never could understand why his loved master was so careless\nas to go to work before he had pronounced it safe. When the fern bed was\nfinished, the Harvester took time to make a trip to town, but there\nwas no word waiting him; so he went to the mullein. It lay on a sunny\nhillside beyond the couch grass and joined a few small fields, the only\ncleared land of the six hundred acres of Medicine Woods. Over rocks and\nlittle hills and hollows spread the pale, grayish-yellow of the green\nleaves, and from five to seven feet arose the flower stems, while\nthe entire earth between was covered with rosettes of young plants.\nBelshazzar went before to give warning if any big rattlers curled in the\nsun on the hillside, and after him followed the Harvester cutting leaves\nin heaps. That was warm work and he covered his head with a floppy old\nstraw hat, with wet grass in the crown, and stopped occasionally to\nrest.\n\nHe loved that yellow-faced hillside. Because so much of his reaping lay\nin the shade and commonly his feet sank in dead leaves and damp earth,\nthe change was a rest. He cheerfully stubbed his toes on rocks, and\nendured the heat without complaint. It appeared to him as if a member of\nevery species of butterfly he knew wavered down the hillside. There were\ngolden-brown danais, with their black-striped wings, jetty troilus with\nan attempt at trailers, big asterias, velvety black with longer trails\nand wide bands of yellow dots. Coenia were most numerous of all and to\nthe Harvester wonderfully attractive in rich, subdued colours with a\nwealth of markings and eye spots. Many small moths, with transparent\nwings and noses red as blood, flashed past him hunting pollen.\nGoldfinches, intent on thistle bloom, wavered through the air trailing\nmellow, happy notes behind them, and often a humming-bird visited the\nmullein. On the lake wild life splashed and chattered incessantly, and\nsometimes the Harvester paused and stood with arms heaped with leaves,\nto interpret some unusually appealing note of pain or anger or some very\nattractive melody. The red-wings were swarming, the killdeers busy, and\nhe thought of the Dream Girl and smiled.\n\n“I wonder if she would like this,” he mused.\n\nWhen the mullein leaves were deep on the trays of the dry-house he began\non the bloom and that was a task he loved. Just to lay off the beds in\nswaths and follow them, deftly picking the stamens and yellow petals\nfrom the blooms. These he would dry speedily in hot air, bottle, and\nsend at once to big laboratories. The listed price was seventy-five\ncents a pound, but the beautiful golden bottles of the Harvester always\nbrought more. The work was worth while, and he liked the location and\ngathering of this particular crop: for these reasons he always left\nit until the last, and then revelled in the gold of sunshine, bird,\nbutterfly, and flower. Several days were required to harvest the mullein\nand during the time the man worked with nimble fingers, while his brain\nwas intensely occupied with the question of what to do next in his\nsearch for the Girl.\n\nWhen the work was finished, he went to the deep wood to take a peep at\nacres of thrifty ginseng, and he was satisfied as he surveyed the big\nbed. Long years he had laboured diligently; soon came the reward. He had\nnot realized it before, but as he studied the situation he saw that\nhe either must begin this harvest at once or employ help. If he waited\nuntil September he could not gather one third of the crop alone.\n\n“But the roots will weigh less if I take them now,” he argued, “and I\ncan work at nothing in comfort until I have located her. I will go on\nwith my search and allow the ginseng to grow that much heavier. What a\npicture! It is folly to disturb this now, for I will lose the seed of\nevery plant I dig, and that is worth almost as much as the root. It is\na question whether I want to furnish the market with seed, and so raise\ncompetition for my bed. I think, be jabbers, that I'll wait for this\nharvest until the seed is ripe, and then bury part of a head where I dig\na root, as the Indians did. That's the idea! The more I grow, the more\nmoney; and I may need considerable for her. One thing I'd like to know:\nAre these plants cultivated? All the books quote the wild at highest\nrates and all I've ever sold was wild. The start grew here naturally.\nWhat I added from the surrounding country was wild, but through and\namong it I've sown seed I bought, and I've tended it with every care.\nBut this is deep wood and wild conditions. I think I have a perfect\nright to so label it. I'll ask Doc. And another thing I'll go through\nthe woods west of Onabasha where I used to find ginseng, and see if I\ncan get a little and then take the same amount of plants grown here,\nand make a test. That way I can discover any difference before I go to\nmarket. This is my gold mine, and that point is mighty important to me,\nso I'll go this very day. I used to find it in the woods northeast of\ntown and on the land Jameson bought, west. Wonder if he lives there yet.\nHe should have died of pure meanness long ago. I'll drive to the river\nand hunt along the bank.”\n\nEarly the following morning the Harvester went to Onabasha and stopped\nat the hospital for news. Finding none, he went through town and several\nmiles into the country on the other side, to a piece of lowland lying\nalong the river bank, where he once had found and carried home to reset\na big bed of ginseng. If he could get only a half pound of roots\nfrom there now, they would serve his purpose. He went down the bank,\nBelshazzar at his heels, and at last found the place. Many trees had\nbeen cut, but there remained enough for shade; the fields bore the\nragged, unattractive appearance of old. The Harvester smiled grimly\nas he remembered that the man who lived there once had charged him for\ndamage he might do to trees in driving across his woods, and boasted to\nhis neighbours that a young fool was paying for the privilege of doing\nhis grubbing. If Jameson had known what the roots he was so anxious to\ndispose of brought a pound on the market at that time, he would have\nbeen insane with anger. So the Harvester's eyes were dancing with fun\nand a wry grin twisted his lips as he clambered over the banks of\nthe recently dredged river, and looked at its pitiful condition and\nstraight, muddy flow.\n\n“Appears to match the remainder of the Jameson property,” he said. “I\ndon't know who he is or where he came from, but he's no farmer. Perhaps\nhe uses this land to corral the stock he buys until he can sell it\nagain.”\n\nHe went down the embankment and began to search for the location where\nhe formerly had found the ginseng. When he came to the place he stood\namazed, for from seed, roots, and plants he had missed, the growth had\nsprung up and spread, so that at a rapid estimate the Harvester thought\nit contained at least five pounds, allowing for what it would shrink on\naccount of being gathered early. He hesitated an instant, and thought\nof coming later; but the drive was long and the loss would not amount\nto enough to pay for a second trip. About taking it, he never thought\nat all. He once had permission from the owner to dig all the shrubs,\nbushes, and weeds he desired from that stretch of woods, and had paid\nfor possible damages that might occur. As he bent to the task there did\ncome a fleeting thought that the patch was weedless and in unusual shape\nfor wild stuff. Then, with swift strokes of his light mattock, he lifted\nthe roots, crammed them into his sack, whistled to Belshazzar, and going\nback to the wagon, drove away. Reaching home he washed the ginseng,\nand spread it on a tray to dry. The first time he wanted the mattock\nhe realized that he had left it lying where he had worked. It was an\nimplement that he had directed a blacksmith to fashion to meet his\nrequirements. No store contained anything half so useful to him. He had\nworked with it for years and it just suited him, so there was nothing to\ndo but go back. Betsy was too tired to return that day, so he planned\nto dig his ginseng with something else, finish his work the following\nmorning, and get the mattock in the afternoon.\n\n“It's like a knife you've carried for years, or a gun,” muttered the\nHarvester. “I actually don't know how to get along without it. What made\nme so careless I can't imagine. I never before in my life did a trick\nlike that. I wonder if I hurried a little. I certainly was free to\ntake it. He always wanted the stuff dug up. Of all the stupid tricks,\nBelshazzar, that was the worst. Now Betsy and a half day of wasted time\nmust pay for my carelessness. Since I have to go, I'll look a little\nfarther. Maybe there is more. Those woods used to be full of it.”\n\nAccording to this programme, the next afternoon the Harvester again\nwalked down the embankment of the mourning river and through the ragged\nwoods to the place where the ginseng had been. He went forward, stepping\nlightly, as men of his race had walked the forest for ages, swerving to\navoid boughs, and looking straight ahead. Contrary to his usual custom\nof coming to heel in a strange wood, Belshazzar suddenly darted around\nthe man and took the path they had followed the previous day. The animal\nwas performing his office in life; he had heard or scented something\nunusual. The Harvester knew what that meant. He looked inquiringly at\nthe dog, glanced around, and then at the earth. Belshazzar proceeded\nnoiselessly at a rapid pace over the leaves: Suddenly the master saw the\ndog stop in a stiff point. Lifting his feet lightly and straining his\neyes before him, the Harvester passed a spice thicket and came in line.\n\nFor one second he stood as rigid as Belshazzar. The next his right arm\nshot upward full length, and began describing circles, his open\npalm heavenward, and into his face leapt a glorified expression of\nexultation. Face down in the rifled ginseng bed lay a sobbing girl. Her\nframe was long and slender, a thick coil of dark hair; bound her head. A\nsecond more and the Harvester bent and softly patted Belshazzar's head.\nThe beast broke point and looked up. The man caught the dog's chin in a\ncaressing grip, again touched his head, moved soundless lips, and waved\ntoward the prostrate figure. The dog hesitated. The Harvester made the\nsame motions. Belshazzar softly stepped over the leaves, passed around\nthe feet of the girl, and paused beside her, nose to earth, softly\nsniffing.\n\nIn one moment she came swiftly to a sitting posture.\n\n“Oh!” she cried in a spasm of fright.\n\nBelshazzar reached an investigating nose and wagged an eager tail.\n\n“Why you are a nice friendly dog!” said the trembling voice.\n\nHe immediately verified the assertion by offering his nose for a kiss.\nThe girl timidly laid a hand on his head.\n\n“Heaven knows I'm lonely enough to kiss a dog,” she said, “but suppose\nyou belong to the man who stole my ginseng, and then ran away so fast he\nforgot his----his piece he digged with.”\n\nBelshazzar pressed closer.\n\n“I am just killed, and I don't care whose dog you are,” sobbed the girl.\n\nShe threw her arms around Belshazzar's neck and laid her white face\nagainst his satiny shoulder. The Harvester could endure no more. He took\na step forward, his face convulsed with pain.\n\n“Please don't!” he begged. “I took your ginseng. I'll bring it back\nto-morrow. There wasn't more than twenty-five or thirty dollars' worth.\nIt doesn't amount to one tear.”\n\nThe girl arose so quickly, the Harvester could not see how she did it.\nWith a startled fright on her face, and the dark eyes swimming, she\nturned to him in one long look. Words rolled from the lips of the man in\na jumble. Behind the tears there was a dull, expressionless blue in the\ngirl's eyes and her face was so white that it appeared blank. He began\ntalking before she could speak, in an effort to secure forgiveness\nwithout condemnation.\n\n“You see, I grow it for a living on land I own, and I've always gathered\nall there was in the country and no one cared. There never was enough in\none place to pay, and no other man wanted to spend the time, and so\nI've always felt free to take it. Every one knew I did, and no one ever\nobjected before. Once I paid Henry Jameson for the privilege of cleaning\nit from these woods. That was six or seven years ago, and it didn't\noccur to me that I wasn't at liberty to dig what has grown since. I'll\nbring it back at once, and pay you for the shrinkage from gathering it\ntoo early. There won't be much over six pounds when it's dry. Please,\nplease don't feel badly. Won't you trust me to return it, and make good\nthe damage I've done?”\n\nThe face of the Harvester was eager and his tones appealing, as he\nleaned forward trying to make her understand.\n\n“Certainly!” said the Girl as she bent to pat the dog, while she\ndried her eyes under cover of the movement. “Certainly! It can make no\ndifference!”\n\nBut as the Harvester drew a deep breath of relief, she suddenly\nstraightened to full height and looked straight at him.\n\n“Oh what is the use to tell a pitiful lie!” she cried. “It does make a\ndifference! It makes all the difference in the world! I need that money!\nI need it unspeakably. I owe a debt I must pay. What----what did I\nunderstand you to say ginseng is worth?”\n\n“If you will take a few steps,” said the Harvester, “and make yourself\ncomfortable on this log in the shade, I will tell you all I know about\nit.”\n\nThe girl walked swiftly to the log indicated, seated herself, and\nwaited. The Harvester followed to a respectful distance.\n\n“I can't tell to an ounce what wet roots would weigh,” he said as easily\nas he could command his voice to speak with the heart in him beating\nwildly, “and of course they lose greatly in drying; but I've handled\nenough that I know the weight I carried home will come to six pounds at\nthe very least. Then you must figure on some loss, because I dug\nthis before it really was ready. It does not reach full growth until\nSeptember, and if it is taken too soon there is a decrease in weight. I\nwill make that up to you when I return it.”\n\nThe troubled eyes were gazing on his face intently, and the Harvester\nstudied them as he talked.\n\n“You would think, then, there would be all of six pounds?\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester, “closer eight. When I replace the shrinkage\nthere is bound to be over seven.”\n\n“And how much did I understand you to say it brought a pound?”\n\n“That all depends,” answered he. “If you cure it yourself, and dry it\ntoo much, you lose in weight. If you carry it in a small lot to the\ndruggists of Onabasha, probably you will not get over five dollars for\nit.”\n\n“Five?”\n\nIt was a startled cry.\n\n“How much did you expect?” asked the Harvester gently.\n\n“Uncle Henry said he thought he could get fifty cents a pound for all I\ncould find.”\n\n“If your Uncle Henry has learned at last that ginseng is a salable\narticle he should know something about the price also. Will you tell\nme what he said, and how you came to think of gathering roots for the\nmarket?”\n\n“There were men talking beneath the trees one Sunday afternoon about old\ntimes and hunting deer, and they spoke of people who made money long ago\ngathering roots and barks, and they mentioned one man who lived by it\nyet.”\n\n“Was his name Langston?”\n\n“Yes, I remember because I liked the name. I was so eager to earn\nsomething, and I can't leave here just now because Aunt Molly is very\nill, so the thought came that possibly I could gather stuff worth money,\nafter my work was finished. I went out and asked questions. They said\nnothing brought enough to make it pay any one, except this ginseng\nplant, and the Langston man almost had stripped the country. Then uncle\nsaid he used to get stuff here, and he might have got some of that. I\nasked what it was like, so they told me and I hunted until I found that,\nand it seemed a quantity to me. Of course I didn't know it had to be\ndried. Uncle took a root I dug to a store, and they told him that it\nwasn't much used any more, but they would give him fifty cents a pound\nfor it. What MAKES you think you can get five dollars?”\n\n“With your permission,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe seated himself on the log, drew from his pocket an old pamphlet,\nand spreading it before her, ran a pencil along the line of a list of\nschedule prices for common drug roots and herbs. Because he understood,\nhis eyes were very bright, and his voice a trifle crisp. A latent anger\nspringing in his breast was a good curb for his emotions. He was closely\nacquainted with all of the druggists of Onabasha, and he knew that not\none of them had offered less than standard prices for ginseng.\n\n“The reason I think so,” he said gently, “is because growing it is the\nlargest part of my occupation, and it was a staple with my father before\nme. I am David Langston, of whom you heard those men speak. Since I was\na very small boy I have lived by collecting herbs and roots, and I get\nmore for ginseng than anything else. Very early I tired of hunting other\npeople's woods for herbs, so I began transplanting them to my own. I\nmoved that bed out there seven years ago. What you found has grown since\nfrom roots I overlooked and seeds that fell at that time. Now do you\nthink I am enough of an authority to trust my word on the subject?”\n\nThere was not a change of expression on her white face.\n\n“You surely should know,” she said wearily, “and you could have no\npossible object in deceiving me. Please go on.”\n\n“Any country boy or girl can find ginseng, gather, wash, and dry it, and\nget five dollars a pound. I can return yours to-morrow and you can cure\nand take it to a druggist I will name you, and sell for that. But if you\nwill allow me to make a suggestion, you can get more. Your roots are now\non the trays of an evaporating house. They will dry to the proper degree\ndesired by the trade, so that they will not lose an extra ounce in\nweight, and if I send them with my stuff to big wholesale houses I deal\nwith, they will be graded with the finest wild ginseng. It is worth more\nthan the cultivated and you will get closer eight dollars a pound for it\nthan five. There is some speculation in it, and the market fluctuates:\nbut, as a rule, I sell for the highest price the drug brings, and, at\ntimes when the season is very dry, I set my own prices. Shall I return\nyours or may I cure and sell it, and bring you the money?”\n\n“How much trouble would that make you?”\n\n“None. The work of digging and washing is already finished. All that\nremains is to weigh it and make a memorandum of the amount when I sell.\nI should very much like to do it. It would be a comfort to see the money\ngo into your hands. If you are afraid to trust me, I will give you the\nnames of several people you can ask concerning me the next time you go\nto the city.”\n\nShe looked at him steadily.\n\n“Never mind that,” she said. “But why do you offer to do it for a\nstranger? It must be some trouble, no matter how small you represent it\nto be.”\n\n“Perhaps I am going to pay you eight and sell for ten.”\n\n“I don't think you can. Five sounds fabulous to me. I can't believe\nthat. If you wanted to make money you needn't have told me you took it.\nI never would have known. That isn't your reason!”\n\n“Possibly I would like to atone for those tears I caused,” said the\nHarvester.\n\n“Don't think of that! They are of no consequence to any one. You needn't\ndo anything for me on that account.”\n\n“Don't search for a reason,” said the Harvester, in his gentlest tones.\n“Forget that feature of the case. Say I'm peculiar, and allow me to do\nit because it would be a pleasure. In close two weeks I will bring you\nthe money. Is it a bargain?”\n\n“Yes, if you care to make it.”\n\n“I care very much. We will call that settled.”\n\n“I wish I could tell you what it will mean to me,” said the Girl.\n\n“If you only would,” plead the Harvester.\n\n“I must not burden a stranger with my troubles.”\n\n“But if it would make the stranger so happy!”\n\n“That isn't possible. I must face life and bear what it brings me\nalone.”\n\n“Not unless you choose,” said the Harvester. “That is, if you will\npardon me, a narrow view of life. It cuts other people out of the joy of\nservice. If you can't tell me, would you trust a very lovely and gentle\nwoman I could bring to you?”\n\n“No more than you. It is my affair; I must work it out myself.”\n\n“I am mighty sorry,” said the Harvester. “I believe you err in that\ndecision. Think it over a day or so, and see if two heads are not better\nthan one. You will realize when this ginseng matter is settled that you\nprofited by trusting me. The same will hold good along other lines, if\nyou only can bring yourself to think so. At any rate, try. Telling a\ntrouble makes it lighter. Sympathy should help, if nothing can be done.\nAnd as for money, I can show you how to earn sums at least worth your\ntime, if you have nothing else you want to do.”\n\nThe Girl bent toward him.\n\n“Oh please do tell me!” she cried eagerly. “I've tried and tried to find\nsome way ever since I have been here, but every one else I have met says\nI can't, and nothing seems to be worth anything. If you only would tell\nme something I could do!”\n\n“If you will excuse my saying so,” said the Harvester, “it appeals to\nme that ease, not work, is the thing you require. You appear extremely\nworn. Won't you let me help you find a way to a long rest first?”\n\n“Impossible!” cried the Girl. “I know I am white and appear ill, but\ntruly I never have been sick in all my life. I have been having trouble\nand working too much, but I'll be better soon. Believe me, there is no\nrest for me now. I must earn the money I owe first.”\n\n“There is a way, if you care to take it,” said the Harvester. “In my\nwork I have become very well acquainted with the chief surgeon of the\ncity hospital. Through him I happen to know that he has a free bed in\na beautiful room, where you could rest until you are perfectly strong\nagain, and that room is empty just now. When you are well, I will tell\nyou about the work.”\n\nAs she arose the Harvester stood, and tall and straight she faced him.\n\n“Impossible!” she said. “It would be brutal to leave my aunt. I cannot\npay to rest in a hospital ward, and I will not accept charity. If you\ncan put me in the way of earning, even a few cents a day, at anything\nI could do outside the work necessary to earn my board here, it would\nbring me closer to happiness than anything else on earth.”\n\n“What I suggest is not impossible,” said the Harvester softly. “If you\nwill go, inside an hour a sweet and gentle lady will come for you and\ntake you to ease and perfect rest until you are strong again. I will see\nthat your aunt is cared for scrupulously. I can't help urging you. It is\na crime to talk of work to a woman so manifestly worn as you are.”\n\n“Then we will not speak of it,” said the Girl wearily. “It is time for\nme to go, anyway. I see you mean to be very kind, and while I don't in\nthe least understand it, I do hope you feel I am grateful. If half\nyou say about the ginseng comes true, I can make a payment worth while\nbefore I had hoped to. I have no words to tell you what that will mean\nto me.”\n\n“If this debt you speak of were paid, could you rest then?”\n\n“I could lie down and give up in peace, and I think I would.”\n\n“I think you wouldn't,” said the Harvester, “because you wouldn't be\nallowed. There are people in these days who make a business of securing\nrest for the tired and over weary, and they would come and prevent that\nif you tried it. Please let me make another suggestion. If you owe money\nto some one you feel needs it and the debt is preying on you, let's pay\nit.”\n\nHe drew a small check-book from his pocket and slipped a pen from a\nband.\n\n“If you will name the amount and give me the address, you shall be free\nto go to the rest I ask for you inside an hour.”\n\nThen slowly from head to foot she looked at him.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because your face and attitude clearly indicate that you are over\ntired. Believe me, you do yourself wrong if you refuse.”\n\n“In what way would changing creditors rest me?”\n\n“I thought perhaps you were owing some one who needed the money. I am\nnot a rich man, but I have no one save myself to provide for and I have\nfunds lying idle that I would be glad to use for you. If you make a\npoint of it, when you are rested, you can repay me.”\n\n“My creditor needs the money, but I should prefer owing him rather than\na perfect stranger. What you suggest would help me not at all. I must go\nnow.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Harvester. “If you will tell me whom to ask for\nand where you live, I will come to see you to-morrow and bring you\nsome pamphlets. With these and with a little help you soon can earn\nany amount a girl is likely to owe. It will require but a little while.\nWhere can I find you?”\n\nThe Girl hesitated and for the first time a hint of colour flushed her\ncheek. But courage appeared to be her strong point.\n\n“Do you live in this part of the country?” she asked.\n\n“I live ten miles from here, east of Onabasha,” he answered.\n\n“Do you know Henry Jameson?”\n\n“By sight and by reputation.”\n\n“Did you ever know anything kind or humane of him?”\n\n“I never did.”\n\n“My name is Ruth Jameson. At present I am indebted to him for the only\nshelter I have. His wife is ill through overwork and worry, and I am\npaying for my bed and what I don't eat, principally, by attempting her\nwork. It scarcely would be fair to Uncle Henry to say that I do it. I\nstagger around as long as I can stand, then I sit through his abuse. He\nis a pleasant man. Please don't think I am telling you this to harrow\nyour sympathy further. The reason I explain is because I am driven. If I\ndo not, you will misjudge me when I say that I only can see you here.\nI understood what you meant when you said Uncle Henry should have known\nthe price of ginseng if he knew it was for sale. He did. He knew what\nhe could get for it, and what he meant to pay me. That is one of his\noriginal methods with a woman. If he thought I could earn anything worth\nwhile, he would allow me, if I killed myself doing it; and then he would\ntake the money by force if necessary. So I can meet you here only. I can\nearn just what I may in secret. He buys cattle and horses and is away\nfrom home much of the day, and when Aunt Molly is comfortable I can have\na few hours.”\n\n“I understand,” said the Harvester. “But this is an added hardship.\nWhy do you remain? Why subject yourself to force and work too heavy for\nyou?”\n\n“Because his is the only roof on earth where I feel I can pay for all I\nget. I don't care to discuss it, I only want you to say you understand,\nif I ask you to bring the pamphlets here and tell me how I can earn\nmoney.”\n\n“I do,” said the Harvester earnestly, although his heart was hot in\nprotest. “You may be very sure that I will not misjudge you. Shall I\ncome at two o'clock to-morrow, Miss Jameson?”\n\n“If you will be so kind.”\n\nThe Harvester stepped aside and she passed him and crossing the rifled\nginseng patch went toward a low brown farmhouse lying in an unkept\ngarden, beside a ragged highway. The man sat on the log she had vacated,\nheld his head between his hands and tried to think, but he could not for\nbig waves of joy that swept over him when he realized that at last he\nhad found her, had spoken with her, and had arranged a meeting for the\nmorrow.\n\n“Belshazzar,” he said softly, “I wish I could leave you to protect\nher. Every day you prove to me that I need you, but Heaven knows her\nnecessity is greater. Bel, she makes my heart ache until it feels like\njelly. There seems to be just one thing to do. Get that fool debt paid\nlike lightning, and lift her out of here quicker than that. Now, we will\ngo and see Doc, and call off the watch-dogs of the law. Ahead of them,\naren't we, Belshazzar? There is a better day coming; we feel it in our\nbones, don't we, old partner?”\n\nThe Harvester started through the woods on a rush, and as the exercise\nwarmed his heart, he grew wonderfully glad. At last he had found her.\nUncertainty was over. If ever a girl needed a home and care he thought\nshe did. He was so jubilant that he felt like crying aloud, shouting for\njoy, but by and by the years of sober repression made their weight felt,\nso he climbed into the wagon and politely requested Betsy to make her\nbest time to Onabasha. Betsy had been asked to make haste so frequently\nof late that she at first almost doubted the sanity of her master, the\nlaw of whose life, until recently, had been to take his time. Now he\nappeared to be in haste every day. She had become so accustomed to\nbeing urged to hurry that she almost had developed a gait; so at the\nHarvester's suggestion she did her level best to Onabasha and the\nhospital, where she loved to nose Belshazzar and rest near the watering\ntap under a big tree.\n\nThe Harvester went down the hall and into the office on the run, and his\nface appeared like a materialized embodiment of living joy. Doctor Carey\nturned at his approach and then bounded half way across the room, his\nhands outstretched.\n\n“You've found her, David!”\n\nThe Harvester grabbed the hand of his friend and stood pumping it up and\ndown while he gulped at the lump in his throat, and big tears squeezed\nfrom his eyes, but he could only nod his proud head.\n\n“Found her!” exulted Doctor Carey. “Really found her! Well that's great!\nSit down and tell me, boy! Is she sick, as we feared? Did you only see\nher or did you get to talk with her?”\n\n“Well sir,” said the Harvester, choking back his emotions, “you remember\nthat ginseng I told you about getting on the old Jameson place last\nnight. To-day, I learned I'd lost that hand-made mattock I use most, and\nI went back for it, and there she was.”\n\n“In the country?”\n\n“Yes sir!”\n\n“Well why didn't we think of it before?”\n\n“I suppose first we would have had to satisfy ourselves that she wasn't\nin town, anyway.”\n\n“Sure! That would be the logical way to go at it! And so you found her?”\n\n“Yes sir, I found her! Just Belshazzar and I! I was going along on my\nway to the place, and he ran past me and made a stiff point, and when I\ncame up, there she was!”\n\n“There she was?”\n\n“Yes sir; there she was!”\n\nThey shook hands again.\n\n“Then of course you spoke to her.”\n\n“Yes I spoke to her.”\n\n“Were you pleased?”\n\n“With her speech and manner?----yes. But, Doc, if ever a woman needed\neverything on earth!”\n\n“Well did you get any kind of a start made?”\n\n“I couldn't do so very much. I had to go a little slow for fear of\nfrightening her, but I tried to get her to come here and she won't until\na debt she owes is paid, and she's in no condition to work.”\n\n“Got any idea how much it is?”\n\n“No, but it can't be any large sum. I tried to offer to pay it, but she\nhad no hesitation in telling me she preferred owing a man she knew to a\nstranger.”\n\n“Well if she is so particular, how did she come to tell you first thing\nthat she was in debt?”\n\nThe Harvester explained.\n\n“Oh I see!” said the doctor. “Well you'll have to baby her along with\nthe idea that she is earning money and pay her double until you get that\noff her mind, and while you are at it, put in your best licks, my boy;\nperk right up and court her like a house afire. Women like it. All of\nthem do. They glory in feeling that a man is crazy about them.”\n\n“Well I'm insane enough over her,” said the Harvester, “but I'd hate\nlike the nation for her to know it. Seems as if a woman couldn't respect\nsuch an addle-pate as I am lately.”\n\n“Don't you worry about that,” advised the doctor. “Just you make love to\nher. Go at it in the good old-fashioned way.”\n\n“But maybe the 'good old-fashioned way' isn't my way.”\n\n“What's the difference whose way it is, if it wins?”\n\n“But Kipling says: 'Each man makes love his own way!'”\n\n“I seem to have heard you mention that name be fore,” said the doctor.\n“Do you regard him as an authority?”\n\n“I do!” said the Harvester. “Especially when he advises me after my own\nheart and reason. Miss Jameson is not a silly girl. She's a woman,\nand twenty-four at least. I don't want her to care for a trick or a\npretence. I do want her to love me. Not that I am worth her attention,\nbut because she needs some strong man fearfully, and I am ready and more\n'willing' than the original Barkis. But, like him, I have to let her\nknow it in my way, and court her according to the promptings of my\nheart.”\n\n“You deceive yourself!” said the doctor flatly. “That's all bosh! Your\ntongue says it for the satisfaction of your ears, and it does sound\nwell. You will court her according to your ideas of the conventions, as\nyou understand them, and strictly in accordance with what you consider\nthe respect due her. If you had followed the thing you call the\n'promptings of your heart,' you would have picked her up by main force\nand brought her to my best ward, instead of merely suggesting it and\ngiving up when she said no. If you had followed your heart, you would\nhave choked the name and amount out of her and paid that devilish debt.\nYou walk away in a case like that, and then have the nerve to come here\nand prate to me about following your heart. I'll wager my last dollar\nyour heart is sore because you were not allowed to help her; but on the\nproposition that you followed its promptings I wouldn't stake a penny.\nThat's all tommy-rot!”\n\n“It is,” agreed the Harvester. “Utter! But what can a man do?”\n\n“I don't know what you can do! I'd have paid that debt and brought her\nto the hospital.”\n\n“I'll go and ask Mrs. Carey about your courtship. I want her help on\nthis, anyway. I can pick up Miss Jameson and bring her here if any man\ncan, but she is nursing a sick woman who depends solely on her for care.\nShe is above average size, and she has a very decided mind of her own.\nI don't think you would use force and do what you think best for her, if\nyou were in my place. You would wait until you understood the situation\nbetter, and knew that what you did was for the best, ultimately.”\n\n“I don't know whether I would or not. One thing is sure: I'm mighty glad\nyou have found her. May I tell my wife?”\n\n“Please do! And ask her if I may depend on her if I need a woman's help.\nNow I'll call off the valiant police and go home and take a good, sound\nsleep. Haven't had many since I first saw her.”\n\nSo Betsy trotted down the valley, up the embankment, crossed the\nrailroad, over the levee across Singing Water, and up the hill to the\ncabin. As they passed it, the Harvester jumped from the wagon, tossed\nthe hitching strap to Belshazzar, and entered. He walked straight to her\ndoor, unlocked it, and uncovering, went inside. Softly he passed from\npiece to piece of the furniture he had made for her, and then surveyed\nthe walls and floor.\n\n“It isn't half good enough,” he said, “but it will have to answer until\nI can do better. Surely she will know I tried and care for that, anyway.\nI wonder how long it will take me to get her here. Oh, if I only could\nknow she was comfortable and happy! Happy! She doesn't appear as if she\never had heard that word. Well this will be a good place to teach her.\nI've always enjoyed myself here. I'm going to have faith that I can win\nher and make her happy also. When I go to the stable to do my work for\nthe night if I could know she was in this cabin and glad of it, and if\nI could hear her down here singing like a happy care-free girl, I'd\nscarcely be able to endure the joy of it.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. THE HARVESTER GOES COURTING\n\n“She is on Henry Jameson's farm, four miles west of Onabasha,” said the\nHarvester, as he opened his eyes next morning, and laid a caressing hand\non Belshazzar's head. “At two o'clock we are going to see her, and we\nare going to prolong the visit to the ultimate limit, so we should make\nthings count here before we start.”\n\nHe worked in a manner that accomplished much. There seemed no end to\nhis energy that morning. Despatching the usual routine, he gathered\nthe herbs that were ready, spread them on the shelves of the dry-house,\nfound time to do several things in the cabin, and polish a piece of\nfurniture before he ate his lunch and hitched Betsy to the wagon.\nHe also had recovered his voice, and talked almost incessantly as he\nworked. When it neared time to start he dressed carefully. He stood\nbefore his bookcase and selected several pamphlets published by the\nDepartment of Agriculture. He went to his beds and gathered a large\narm load of plants. Then he was ready to make his first trip to see the\nDream Girl, but it never occurred to him that he was going courting.\n\nHe had decided fully that there would be no use to try to make love to\na girl manifestly so ill and in trouble. The first thing, it appeared to\nhim, was to dispel the depression, improve the health, and then do the\nlove making. So, in the most business-like manner possible and without\na shade of embarrassment, the Harvester took his herbs and books and\nstarted for the Jameson woods. At times as he drove along he espied\nsomething that he used growing beside the road and stopped to secure a\nspecimen.\n\nHe came down the river bank and reached the ginseng bed at half-past\none. He was purposely early. He laid down his books and plants,\nand rolled the log on which she sat the day before to a more shaded\nlocation, where a big tree would serve for a back rest. He pulled away\nbrush and windfalls, heaped dry brown leaves, and tramped them down\nfor her feet. Then he laid the books on the log, the arm load of plants\nbeside them, and went to the river to wash his soiled hands.\n\nBelshazzar's short bark told him the Girl was coming, and between the\ntrees he saw the dog race to meet her and she bent to stroke his\nhead. She wore the same dress and appeared even paler and thinner. The\nHarvester hurried up the bank, wiping his hands on his handkerchief.\n\n“Glad to see you!” he greeted her casually. “I've fixed you a seat\nwith a back rest to-day. Don't be frightened at the stack of herbs. You\nneedn't gather all of those. They are only suggestions. They are just\ncommon roadside plants that have some medicinal value and are worth\ncollecting. Please try my davenport.”\n\n“Thank you!” she said as she dropped on the log and leaned her head\nagainst the tree. It appeared as if her eyes closed a few seconds in\nspite of her, and while they were shut the Harvester looked steadily\nand intently on a face of exquisite beauty, but so marred by pallor and\nlines of care that search was required to recognize just how handsome\nshe was, and if he had not seen her in perfection in the dream the\nHarvester might have missed glorious possibilities. To bring back that\nvision would be a task worth while was his thought. With the first faint\nquiver of an eyelash the Harvester took a few steps and bent over a\nplant, and as he did so the Girl's eyes followed him.\n\nHe appeared so tall and strong, so bronzed by summer sun and wind, his\nface so keen and intense, that swift fear caught her heart. Why was he\nthere? Why should he take so much trouble for her? With difficulty she\nrestrained herself from springing up and running away. Turning with\nthe plant in his hand the Harvester saw the panic in her eyes, and\nit troubled his heart. For an instant he was bewildered, then he\nunderstood.\n\n“I don't want you to work when you are not able,” he said in his most\nmatter-of-fact voice, “but if you still think that you are, I'll be very\nglad. I need help just now, more than I can tell you, and there seem to\nbe so few people who can be trusted. Gathering stuff for drugs is really\nvery serious business. You see, I've a reputation to sustain with some\nof the biggest laboratories in the country, not to mention the fact\nthat I sometimes try compounding a new remedy for some common complaint\nmyself. I rather take pride in the fact that my stuff goes in so fresh\nand clean that I always get anywhere from three to ten cents a pound\nabove the listed prices for it. I want that money, but I want an\nunbroken record for doing a job right and being square and careful, much\nmore.”\n\nHe thought the appearance of fright was fading, and a tinge of interest\ntaking its place. She was looking straight at him, and as he talked he\ncould see her summoning her tired forces to understand and follow him,\nso he continued:\n\n“One would think that as medicines are required in cases of life and\ndeath, collectors would use extreme caution, but some of them are\ncriminally careless. It's a common thing to gather almost any fern\nfor male fern; to throw in anything that will increase weight, to wash\nimperfectly, and commit many other sins that lie with the collector;\nbeyond that I don't like to think. I suppose there are men who\ndeliberately adulterate pure stuff to make it go farther, but when it\ncomes to drugs, I scarcely can speak of it calmly. I like to do a thing\nright. I raise most of my plants, bushes, and herbs. I gather exactly\nin season, wash carefully if water dare be used, clean them otherwise\nif not, and dry them by a hot air system in an evaporator I built\npurposely. Each package I put up is pure stuff, clean, properly dried,\nand fresh. If I caught any man in the act of adulterating any of it I'm\nafraid he would get hurt badly--and usually I am a peaceable man. I\nam explaining this to show how very careful you must be to keep things\nseparate and collect the right plants if you are going to sell stuff to\nme. I am extremely particular.”\n\nThe Girl was leaning toward him, watching his face, and hers was slowly\nchanging. She was deeply interested, much impressed, and more at ease.\nWhen the Harvester saw he had talked her into confidence he crossed\nthe leaves, and sitting on the log beside her, picked up the books and\nopened one.\n\n“Oh I will be careful,” said the Girl. “If you will trust me to collect\nfor you, I will undertake only what I am sure I know, and I'll do\nexactly as you tell me.”\n\n“There are a dozen things that bring a price ranging from three to\nfifteen cents a pound, that are in season just now. I suppose you would\nlike to begin on some common, easy things, that will bring the most\nmoney.”\n\nWithout a breath of hesitation she answered, “I will commence on\nwhatever you are short of and need most to have.”\n\nThe heart of the Harvester gave a leap that almost choked him, for\nhe was vividly conscious of a broken shoe she was hiding beneath her\nskirts. He wanted to say “thank you,” but he was afraid to, so he turned\nthe leaves of the book.\n\n“I am working just now on mullein,” he said.\n\n“Oh I know mullein,” she cried, with almost a hint of animation in her\nvoice. “The tall, yellow flower stem rising from a circle of green felt\nleaves!”\n\n“Good!” said the Harvester. “What a pretty way to describe it! Do you\nknow any more plants?”\n\n“Only a few! I had a high-school course in botany, but it was all about\nflower and leaf formation, nothing at all of what anything was good for.\nI also learned a few, drawing them for leather and embroidery designs.”\n\n“Look here!” cried the Harvester. “I came with an arm load of herbs and\nexpected to tell you all about foxglove, mullein, yarrow, jimson,\npurple thorn apple, blessed thistle, hemlock, hoarhound, lobelia, and\neverything in season now; but if you already have a profession, why do\nyou attempt a new one? Why don't you go on drawing? I never saw anything\nso stupid as most of the designs from nature for book covers and\ndecorations, leather work and pottery. They are the same old subjects\nworked over and over. If you can draw enough to make original copies,\nI can furnish you with flowers, vines, birds, and insects, new, unused,\nand of exquisite beauty, for every month in the year. I've looked into\nthe matter a little, because I am rather handy with a knife, and I carve\ncandlesticks from suitable pieces of wood. I always have trouble getting\nmy designs copied; securing something new and unusual, never! If you can\ndraw just well enough to reproduce what you see, gathering drugs is too\nslow and tiresome. What you want to do is to reproduce the subjects I\nwill bring, and I'll buy what I want in my work, and sell the remainder\nat the arts and crafts stores for you. Or I can find out what they pay\nfor such designs at potteries and ceramic factories. You have no time to\nspend on herbs, when you are in the woods, if you can draw.”\n\n“I am surely in the woods,” said the Girl, “and I know I can copy\ncorrectly. I often made designs for embroidery and leather for the shop\nmother and I worked for in Chicago.”\n\n“Won't they buy them of you now?”\n\n“Undoubtedly.”\n\n“Do they pay anything worth while?”\n\n“I don't know how their prices compare with others. One place was all I\nworked for. I think they pay what is fair.”\n\n“We will find out,” said the Harvester promptly.\n\n“I----I don't think you need waste the time,” faltered the Girl. “I had\nbetter gather the plants for a while at least.”\n\n“Collecting crude drug material is not easy,” said the Harvester.\n“Drawing may not be either, but at least you could sit while you work,\nand it should bring you more money. Besides, I very much want a moth\ncopied for a candlestick I am carving. Won't you draw that for me? I\nhave some pupae cases and the moths will be out any day now. If I'd\nbring you one, wouldn't you just make a copy?”\n\nThe Girl gripped her hands together and stared straight ahead of her for\na second, then she turned to him.\n\n“I'd like to,” she said, “but I have nothing to work with. In Chicago\nthey furnished my material at the shop and I drew the design and was\npaid for the pattern. I didn't know there would be a chance for anything\nlike that here. I haven't even proper pencils.”\n\n“Then the way for you to do this is to strip the first mullein plants\nyou see of the petals. I will pay you seventy-five cents a pound for\nthem. By the time you get a few pounds I can have material you need\nfor drawing here and you can go to work on whatever flowers, vines, and\nthings you can find in the woods, with no thanks to any one.”\n\n“I can't see that,” said the Girl. “It would appear to me that I would\nbe under more obligations than I could repay, and to a stranger.”\n\n“I figure it this way,” said the Harvester, watching from the corner\nof his eye. “I can sell at good prices all the mullein flowers I can\nsecure. You collect for me, I buy them. You can use drawing tools; I\nget them for you, and you pay me with the mullein or out of the ginseng\nmoney I owe you. You already have that coming, and it's just as much\nyours as it will be ten days from now. You needn't hesitate a second\nabout drawing on it, because I am in a hurry for the moth pattern.\nI find time to carve only at night, you see. As for being under\nobligations to a stranger, in the first place all the debt would be on\nmy side. I'd get the drugs and the pattern I want; and, in the second\nplace, I positively and emphatically refuse to be a stranger. It would\nbe so much better to be mutual helpers and friends of the kind worth\nhaving; and the sooner we begin, the sooner we can work together to\ngood advantage. Get that stranger idea out of your head right now, and\nreplace it with thoughts of a new friend, who is willing”--the Harvester\ndetected panic in her eyes and ended casually--“to enter a partnership\nthat will be of benefit to both of us. Partners can't be strangers, you\nknow,” he finished.\n\n“I don't know what to think,” said the Girl.\n\n“Never bother your head with thinking,” advised the Harvester with an\nair of large wisdom. “It is unprofitable and very tiring. Any one can\nsee that you are too weary now. Don't dream of such a foolish thing as\nthinking. Don't worry over motives and obligations. Say to yourself,\n'I'll enter this partnership and if it brings me anything good, I'm that\nmuch ahead. If it fails, I have lost nothing.' That's the way to look at\nit.”\n\nThen before she could answer he continued: “Now I want all the mullein\nbloom I can get. You'll see the yellow heads everywhere. Strip the\npetals and bring them here, and I'll come for them every day. They must\ngo on the trays as fresh as possible. On your part, we will make out the\norder now.”\n\nHe took a pencil and notebook from his pocket.\n\n“You want drawing pencils and brushes; how many, what make and size?”\n\nThe Girl hesitated for a moment as if struggling to decide what to do;\nthen she named the articles.\n\n“And paper?”\n\nHe wrote that down, and asked if there was more.\n\n“I think,” he said, “that I can get this order filled in Onabasha. The\nart stores should keep these things. And shouldn't you have water-colour\npaper and some paint?”\n\nThen there was a flash across the white face.\n\n“Oh if I only could!” she cried. “All my life I have been crazy for a\nbox of colour, but I never could afford it, and of course, I can't now.\nBut if this splendid plan works, and I can earn what I owe, then maybe I\ncan.”\n\n“Well this 'splendid plan' is going to 'work,' don't you bother about\nthat,” said the Harvester. “It has begun working right now. Don't worry\na minute. After things have gone wrong for a certain length of time,\nthey always veer and go right a while as compensation. Don't think of\nanything save that you are at the turning. Since it is all settled that\nwe are to be partners, would you name me the figures of the debt that\nis worrying you? Don't, if you mind. I just thought perhaps we could get\nalong better if I knew. Is it----say five hundred dollars?”\n\n“Oh dear no!” cried the Girl in a panic. “I never could face that! It is\nnot quite one hundred, and that seems big as a mountain to me.”\n\n“Forget it!” he cried. “The ginseng will pay more than half; that I\nknow. I can bring you the cash in a little over a week.”\n\nShe started to speak, hesitated, and at last turned to him.\n\n“Would you mind,” she said, “if I asked you to keep it until I can find\na way to go to town? It's too far to walk and I don't know how to send\nit. Would I dare put it in a letter?”\n\n“Never!” said the Harvester. “You want a draft. That money will be too\nprecious to run any risks. I'll bring it to you and you can write a note\nand explain to whom you want it paid, and I'll take it to the bank for\nyou and get your draft. Then you can write a letter, and half your worry\nwill be over safely.”\n\n“It must be done in a sure way,” said the Girl. “If I knew I had the\nmoney to pay that much on what I owe, and then lost it, I simply could\nnot endure it. I would lie down and give up as Aunt Molly has.”\n\n“Forget that too!” said the Harvester. “Wipe out all the past that has\npain in it. The future is going to be beautifully bright. That little\nbird on the bush there just told me so, and you are always safe when you\ntrust the feathered folk. If you are going to live in the country\nany length of time, you must know them, and they will become a great\ncomfort. Are you planning to be here long?”\n\n“I have no plans. After what I saw Chicago do to my mother I would\nrather finish life in the open than return to the city. It is horrible\nhere, but at least I'm not hungry, and not afraid----all the time.”\n\n“Gracious Heaven!” cried the Harvester. “Do you mean to say that you are\nafraid any part of the time? Would you kindly tell me of whom, and why?”\n\n“You should know without being told that when a woman born and reared\nin a city, and all her life confined there, steps into the woods for the\nfirst time, she's bound to be afraid. The last few weeks constitute my\nentire experience with the country, and I'm in mortal fear that snakes\nwill drop from trees and bushes or spring from the ground. Some places I\nthink I'm sinking, and whenever a bush catches my skirts it seems as\nif something dreadful is reaching up for me; there is a possibility of\nhorror lurking behind every tree and----”\n\n“Stop!” cried the Harvester. “I can't endure it! Do you mean to tell me\nthat you are afraid here and now?”\n\nShe met his eyes squarely.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “It almost makes me ill to sit on this log without\ntaking a stick and poking all around it first. Every minute I think\nsomething is going to strike me in the back or drop on my head.”\n\nThe Harvester grew very white beneath the tan, and that developed a\nnice, sickly green complexion for him.\n\n“Am I part of your tortures?” he asked tersely.\n\n“Why shouldn't you be?” she answered. “What do I know of you or your\nmotives or why you are here?”\n\n“I have had no experience with the atmosphere that breeds such an\nattitude in a girl.”\n\n“That is a thing for which to thank Heaven. Undoubtedly it is gracious\nto you. My life has been different.”\n\n“Yet in mortal terror of the woods, and probably equal fear of me, you\nare here and asking for work that will keep you here.”\n\n“I would go through fire and flood for the money I owe. After that debt\nis paid----”\n\nShe threw out her hands in a hopeless gesture. The Harvester drew forth\na roll of bills and tossed them into her lap.\n\n“For the love of mercy take what you need and pay it,” he said. “Then\nget a floor under your feet, and try, I beg of you, try to force\nyourself to have confidence in me, until I do something that gives you\nthe least reason for distrusting me.”\n\nShe picked up the money and gave it a contemptuous whirl that landed it\nat his feet.\n\n“What greater cause of distrust could I have by any possibility than\njust that?” she asked.\n\nThe Harvester arose hastily, and taking several steps, he stood with\nfolded arms, his back turned. The Girl sat watching him with wide eyes,\nthe dull blue plain in their dusky depths. When he did not speak, she\ngrew restless. At last she slowly arose and circling him looked into his\nface. It was convulsed with a struggle in which love and patience fought\nfor supremacy over honest anger. As he saw her so close, his lips drew\napart, and his breath came deeply, but he did not speak. He merely stood\nand looked at her, and looked; and she gazed at him as if fascinated,\nbut uncomprehending.\n\n“Ruth!”\n\nThe call came roaring up the hill. The Girl shivered and became paler.\n\n“Is that your uncle?” asked the Harvester.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Will you come to-morrow for your drawing materials?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Will you try to believe that there is absolutely nothing, either\nunderfoot or overhead, that will harm you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Will you try to think that I am not a menace to public safety, and that\nI would do much to help you, merely because I would be glad to be of\nservice?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Will you try to cultivate the idea that there is nothing in all this\nworld that would hurt you purposely?”\n\n“Ruth!” came a splitting scream in gruff man-tones, keyed in deep anger.\n\n“That SOUNDS like it!” said the Girl, and catching up her skirts she ran\nthrough the woods, taking a different route toward the house.\n\nThe Harvester sat on the log and tried to think; but there are times\nwhen the numbed brain refuses to work, so he really sat and suffered.\nBelshazzar whimpered and licked his hands, and at last the man arose\nand went with the dog to the wagon. As they came through Onabasha, Betsy\nturned at the hospital corner, but the Harvester pulled her around and\ndrove toward the country. Not until they crossed the railroad did he\nlift his head and then he drew a deep breath as if starved for pure air\nand spoke. “Not to-day Betsy! I can't face my friends just now. Someway\nI am making an awful fist of things. Everything I do is wrong. She no\nmore trusts me than you would a rattlesnake, Belshazzar; and from all\nappearance she takes me to be almost as deadly. What must have been her\nexperiences in life to ingrain fear and distrust in her soul at that\nrate? I always knew I was not handsome, but I never before regarded my\nappearance as alarming. And I 'fixed up,' too!”\n\nThe Harvester grinned a queer little twist of a grin that pulled and\ndistorted his strained face. “Might as well have gone with a week's\nbeard, a soiled shirt, and a leer! And I've always been as decent as I\nknew! What's the reward for clean living anyway, if the girl you love\nstrikes you like that?”\n\nBelshazzar reached across and kissed him. The Harvester put his arm\naround the dog. In the man's disappointment and heart hunger he leaned\nhis head against the beast and said, “I've always got you to love and\nprotect me, anyway, Belshazzar. Maybe the man who said a dog was a man's\nbest friend was right. You always trusted me, didn't you Bel? And you\nnever regretted it but once, and that wasn't my fault. I never did it!\nIf I did, I'm getting good and well paid for it. I'd rather be kicked\nuntil all the ribs of one side are broken, Bel, than to swallow the dose\nshe just handed me. I tell you it was bitter, lad! What am I going to\ndo? Can't you help me, Bel?”\n\nBelshazzar quivered in anxiety to offer the comfort he could not speak.\n\n“Of course you are right! You always are, Bel!” said the Harvester. “I\nknow what you are trying to tell me. Sure enough, she didn't have any\ndream. I am afraid she had the bitterest reality. She hasn't been loving\na vision of me, working and searching for me, and I don't mean to her\nwhat she does to me. Of course I see that I must be patient and bide my\ntime. If there is anything in 'like begetting like' she is bound to care\nfor me some day, for I love her past all expression, and for all she\nfeels I might as well save my breath. But she has got to awake some day,\nBel. She can make up her mind to that. She can't see 'why.' Over and\nover! I wonder what she would think if I'd up and tell her 'why' with no\nfrills. She will drive me to it some day, then probably the shock will\nfinish her. I wonder if Doc was only fooling or if he really would do\nwhat he said. It might wake her up, anyway, but I'm dubious as to the\nresult. How Uncle Henry can roar! He sounded like a fog horn. I'd love\nto try my muscle on a man like that. No wonder she is afraid of him, if\nshe is of me. Afraid! Well of all things I ever did expect, Belshazzar,\nthat is the limit.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. THE CHIME OF THE BLUE BELLS\n\nThe Harvester finished his evening work and went to examine the cocoons.\nMany of the moths had emerged and flown, but the luna cases remained\nin the bottom of the box. As he stood looking at them one moved and he\nsmiled.\n\n“I'd give something if you would come out and be ready to work on by\nto-morrow afternoon,” he said. “Possibly you would so interest her that\nshe would forget her fear of me. I'd like mighty well to take you\nalong, because she might care for you, and I do need the pattern for my\ncandlestick. Believe I'll lay you in a warmer place.”\n\nThe first thing the next morning the Harvester looked and found the open\ncocoon and the wet moth clinging by its feet to a twig he had placed for\nit.\n\n“Luck is with me!” he exulted. “I'll carry you to her and be mighty\ncareful what I say, and maybe she will forget about the fear.”\n\nAll the forenoon he cut and spread boneset, saffron, and hemlock on the\ntrays to dry. At noon he put on a fresh outfit, ate a hasty lunch, and\ndrove to Onabasha. He carried the moth in a box, and as he started he\npicked up a rake. He went to an art store and bought the pencils and\npaper she had ordered. He wanted to purchase everything he saw for her,\nbut he was fast learning a lesson of deep caution. If he took more than\nshe ordered, she would worry over paying, and if he refused to\naccept money, she would put that everlasting “why” at him again. The\nwater-colour paper and paint he could not forego. He could make a desire\nto have the moth coloured explain those, he thought.\n\nThen he went to a furniture store and bought several articles, and\nforgetting his law against haste, he drove Betsy full speed to the\nriver. He was rather heavily ladened as he went up the bank, and it\nwas only one o'clock. There was an hour. He rolled away the log, raked\ntogether and removed the leaves to the ground. He tramped the earth\nlevel and spread a large cheap porch rug. On this he opened and placed\na little folding table and chair. On the table he spread the pencils,\npaper, colour box and brushes, and went to the river to fill the water\ncup. Then he sat on the log he had rolled to one side and waited. After\ntwo hours he arose and crept as close the house as he could through the\nwoods, but he could not secure a glimpse of the Girl. He went back and\nwaited an hour more, and then undid his work and removed it. When he\ncame to the moth his face was very grim as he lifted the twig and helped\nthe beautiful creature to climb on a limb. “You'll be ready to fly in\na few hours,” he said. “If I keep you in a box you will ruin your wings\nand be no suitable subject, and put you in a cyanide jar I will not. I\nam hurt too badly myself. I wonder if what Doc said was the right way!\nIt's certainly a temptation.”\n\nThen he went home; and again Betsy veered at the hospital, and once more\nthe Harvester explained to her that he did not want to see the doctor.\nThat evening and the following forenoon were difficult, but the\nHarvester lived through them, and in the afternoon went back to the\nwoods, spread his rug, and set up the table. Only one streak of luck\nbrightened the gloom in his heart. A yellow emperor had emerged in the\nnight, and now occupied the place of yesterday's luna. She never need\nknow it was not the one he wanted, and it would make an excuse for the\ncolour box.\n\nHe was watching intently and saw her coming a long way off. He noticed\nthat she looked neither right nor left, but came straight as if walking\na bridge. As she reached the place she glanced hastily around and then\nat him. The Harvester forgave her everything as he saw the look of\nrelief with which she stepped upon the carpet. Then she turned to him.\n\n“I won't have to ask 'why' this time,” she said. “I know that you did it\nbecause I was baby enough to tell what a coward I am. I'm sure you\ncan't afford it, and I know you shouldn't have done it, but oh, what a\ncomfort! If you will promise never to do any such expensive, foolish,\nkind thing again, I'll say thank you this time. I couldn't come\nyesterday, because Aunt Molly was worse and Uncle Henry was at home all\nday.”\n\n“I supposed it was something like that,” said the Harvester.\n\nShe advanced and handed him the roll of bills.\n\n“I had a feeling you would be reckless,” she said. “I saw it in your\nface, so I came back as soon as I could steal away, and sure enough,\nthere lay your money and the books and everything. I hid them in the\nthicket, so they will be all right. I've almost prayed it wouldn't rain.\nI didn't dare carry them to the house. Please take the money. I haven't\ntime to argue about it or strength, but of course I can't possibly use\nit unless I earn it. I'm so anxious to see the pencils and paper.”\n\nThe Harvester thrust the money into his pocket. The Girl went to the\ntable, opened and spread the paper, and took out the pencils.\n\n“Is my subject in here?” she touched the colour box.\n\n“No, the other.”\n\n“Is it alive? May I open it?”\n\n“We will be very careful at first,” said the Harvester. “It only left\nits case in the night and may fly. When the weather is so warm the wings\ndevelop rapidly. Perhaps if I remove the lid----”\n\nHe took off the cover, exposing a big moth, its lovely, pale yellow\nwings, flecked with heliotrope, outspread as it clung to a twig in the\nbox. The Girl leaned forward.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\n“One of the big night moths that emerge and fly a few hours in June.”\n\n“Is this what you want for your candlestick?”\n\n“If I can't do better. There is one other I prefer, but it may not come\nat a time that you can get it right.”\n\n“What do you mean by 'right'?”\n\n“So that you can copy it before it wants to fly.”\n\n“Why don't you chloroform and pin it until I am ready?”\n\n“I am not in the business of killing and impaling exquisite creatures\nlike that.”\n\n“Do you mean that if I can't draw it when it is just right you will let\nit go?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I told you why.”\n\n“I know you said you were not in the business, but why wouldn't you take\nonly one you really wanted to use?”\n\n“I would be afraid,” replied the Harvester.\n\n“Afraid? You!”\n\n“I must have a mighty good reason before I kill,” said the man. “I\ncannot give life; I have no right to take it away. I will let my\nstatement stand. I am afraid.”\n\n“Of what please?”\n\n“An indefinable something that follows me and makes me suffer if I am\nwantonly cruel.”\n\n“Is there any particular pose in which you want this bird placed?”\n\n“Allow me to present you to the yellow emperor, known in the books as\neagles imperialis,” he said. “I want him as he clings naturally and life\nsize.”\n\nShe took up a pencil.\n\n“If you don't mind,” said the Harvester, “would you draw on this other\npaper? I very much want the colour, also, and you can use it on this.\nI brought a box along, and I'll get you water. I had it all ready\nyesterday.”\n\n“Did you have this same moth?”\n\n“No, I had another.”\n\n“Did you have the one you wanted most?”\n\n“Yes----but it's no difference.”\n\n“And you let it go because I was not here?”\n\n“No. It went on account of exquisite beauty. If kept in confinement it\nwould struggle and break its wings. You see, that one was a delicate\ngreen, where this is yellow, plain pale blue green, with a lavender rib\nhere, and long curled trailers edged with pale yellow, and eye spots\nrimmed with red and black.”\n\nAs the Harvester talked he indicated the points of difference with a\npencil he had picked up; now he laid it down and retreated beyond the\nlimits of the rug.\n\n“I see,” said the Girl. “And this is colour?”\n\nShe touched the box.\n\n“A few colours, rather,” said the Harvester. “I selected enough to fill\nthe box, with the help of the clerk who sold them to me. If they are not\nright, I have permission to return and exchange them for anything you\nwant.”\n\nWith eager fingers she opened the box, and bent over it a face filled\nwith interest.\n\n“Oh how I've always wanted this! I scarcely can wait to try it. I do\nhope I can have it for my very own. Was it quite expensive?”\n\n“No. Very cheap!” said the Harvester. “The paper isn't worth mentioning.\nThe little, empty tin box was only a few cents, and the paints differ\naccording to colour. Some appear to be more than others. I was surprised\nthat the outfit was so inexpensive.”\n\nA skeptical little smile wavered on the Girl's face as she drew her\nslender fingers across the trays of bright colour.\n\n“If one dared accept your word, you really would be a comfort,” she\nsaid, as she resolutely closed the box, pushed it away, and picked up a\npencil.\n\n“If you will take the trouble to inquire at the banks, post office,\nexpress office, hospital or of any druggist in Onabasha, you will\nfind that my word is exactly as good as my money, and taken quite as\nreadily.”\n\n“I didn't say I doubted you. I have no right to do that until I feel\nyou deceive me. What I said was 'dared accept,' which means I must not,\nbecause I have no right. But you make one wonder what you would do if\nyou were coaxed and asked for things and led by insinuations.”\n\n“I can tell you that,” said the Harvester. “It would depend altogether\non who wanted anything of me and what they asked. If you would undertake\nto coax and insinuate, you never would get it done, because I'd see what\nyou needed and have it at hand before you had time.”\n\nThe Girl looked at him wonderingly.\n\n“Now don't spring your recurrent 'why' on me,” said the Harvester. “I'll\ntell you 'why' some of these days. Just now answer me this question: Do\nyou want me to remain here or leave until you finish? Which way would\nyou be least afraid?”\n\n“I am not at all afraid on the rug and with my work,” she said. “If you\nwant to hunt ginseng go by all means.”\n\n“I don't want to hunt anything,” said the Harvester. “But if you are\nmore comfortable with me away, I'll be glad to go. I'll leave the dog\nwith you.”\n\nHe gave a short whistle and Belshazzar came bounding to him. The\nHarvester stepped to the Girl's side, and dropping on one knee, he drew\nhis hand across the rug close to her skirts.\n\n“Right here, Belshazzar,” he said. “Watch! You are on guard, Bel.”\n\n“Well of all names for a dog!” exclaimed the Girl. “Why did you select\nthat?”\n\n“My mother named my first dog Belshazzar, and taught me why; so each of\nthe three I've owned since have been christened the same. It means 'to\nprotect' and that is the office all of them perform; this one especially\nhas filled it admirably. Once I failed him, but he never has gone back\non me. You see he is not a particle afraid of me. Every step I take, he\nis at my heels.”\n\n“So was Bill Sikes' dog, if I remember.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed.\n\n“Bel,” he said, “if you could speak you'd say that was an ugly one,\nwouldn't you?”\n\nThe dog sprang up and kissed the face of the man and rubbed a loving\nhead against his breast.\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester. “Now lie down and protect this woman as\ncarefully as you ever watched in your life. And incidentally, Bel,\ntell her that she can't exterminate me more than once a day, and the\nperformance is accomplished for the present. I refuse to be a willing\nsacrifice. 'So was Bill Sikes' dog!' What do you think of that, Bel?”\n\nThe Harvester arose and turned to go.\n\n“What if this thing attempts to fly?” she asked.\n\n“Your pardon,” said the Harvester. “If the emperor moves, slide the lid\nover the box a few seconds, until he settles and clings quietly again,\nand then slowly draw it away. If you are careful not to jar the table\nheavily he will not go for hours yet.”\n\nAgain he turned.\n\n“If there is no danger, why do you leave the dog?”\n\n“For company,” said the Harvester. “I thought you would prefer an animal\nyou are not afraid of to a man you are. But let me tell you there is no\nnecessity for either. I know a woman who goes alone and unafraid through\nevery foot of woods in this part of the country. She has climbed, crept,\nand waded, and she tells me she never saw but two venomous snakes this\nside of Michigan. Nothing ever dropped on her or sprang at her. She\nfeels as secure in the woods as she does at home.”\n\n“Isn't she afraid of snakes?”\n\n“She dislikes snakes, but she is not afraid or she would not risk\nencountering them daily.”\n\n“Do you ever find any?”\n\n“Harmless little ones, often. That is, Bel does. He is always nosing for\nthem, because he understands that I work in the earth. I think I have\nencountered three dangerous ones in my life. I will guarantee you will\nnot find one in these woods. They are too open and too much cleared.”\n\n“Then why leave the dog?”\n\n“I thought,” said the Harvester patiently, “that your uncle might have\nturned in some of his cattle, or if pigs came here the dog could chase\nthem away.”\n\nShe looked at him with utter panic in her face.\n\n“I am far more afraid of a cow than a snake!” she cried. “It is so much\nbigger!”\n\n“How did you ever come into these woods alone far enough to find the\nginseng?” asked the Harvester. “Answer me that!”\n\n“I wore Uncle Henry's top boots and carried a rake, and I suffered\ntortures,” she replied.\n\n“But you hunted until you found what you wanted, and came again to keep\nwatch on it?”\n\n“I was driven--simply forced. There's no use to discuss it!”\n\n“Well thank the Lord for one thing,” said the Harvester. “You didn't\nappear half so terrified at the sight of me as you did at the mere\nmention of a cow. I have risen inestimably in my own self-respect.\nBelshazzar, you may pursue the elusive chipmunk. I am going to guard\nthis woman myself, and please, kind fates, send a ferocious cow this\nway, in order that I may prove my valour.”\n\nThe Girl's face flushed slightly, and she could not restrain a laugh.\nThat was all the Harvester hoped for and more. He went beyond the edge\nof the rug and sat on the leaves under a tree. She bent over her work\nand only bird and insect notes and occasionally Belshazzar's excited\nbark broke the silence. The Harvester stretched on the ground, his eyes\nfeasting on the Girl. Intensely he watched every movement. If a squirrel\nbarked she gave a nervous start, so precipitate it seemed as if it must\nhurt. If a windfall came rattling down she appeared ready to fly in\nheadlong terror in any direction. At last she dropped her pencil and\nlooked at him helplessly.\n\n“What is it?” he asked.\n\n“The silence and these awful crashes when one doesn't know what is\ncoming,” she said.\n\n“Will it bother you if I talk? Perhaps the sound of my voice will help?”\n\n“I am accustomed to working when people talk, and it will be a comfort.\nI may be able to follow you, and that will prevent me from thinking.\nThere are dreadful things in my mind when they are not driven out.\nPlease talk! Tell me about the herbs you gathered this morning.”\n\nThe Harvester gave the Girl one long look as she bent over her work. He\nwas vividly conscious of the graceful curves of her little figure, the\ncoil of dark, silky hair, softly waving around her temples and neck,\nand when her eyes turned in his direction he knew that it was only the\nwhite, drawn face that restrained him. He was almost forced to tell her\nhow he loved and longed for her; about the home he had prepared; of\na thousand personal interests. Instead, he took a firm grip and said\ncasually, “Foxglove harvest is over. This plant has to be taken when the\nleaves are in second year growth and at bloom time. I have stripped my\nmullein beds of both leaves and flowers. I finished a week ago. Beyond\nlies a stretch of Parnassus grass that made me think of you, it was so\nwhite and delicate. I want you to see it. It will be lovely in a few\nweeks more.”\n\n“You never had seen me a week ago.”\n\n“Oh hadn't I?” said the Harvester. “Well maybe I dreamed about you then.\nI am a great dreamer. Once I had a dream that may interest you some\nday, after you've overcome your fear of me. Now this bed of which I was\nspeaking is a picture in September. You must arrange to drive home with\nme and see it then.”\n\n“For what do you sell foxglove and mullein?”\n\n“Foxglove for heart trouble, and mullein for catarrh. I get ten cents a\npound for foxglove leaves and five for mullein and from seventy-five to\na dollar for flowers of the latter, depending on how well I preserve the\ncolour in drying them. They must be sealed in bottles and handled with\nextreme care.”\n\n“Then if I wasn't too childish to be out picking them, I could be\nearning seventy-five cents a pound for mullein blooms?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester, “but until you learned the trick of stripping\nthem rapidly you scarcely could gather what would weigh two pounds a\nday, when dried. Not to mention the fact that you would have to stand\nand work mostly in hot sunshine, because mullein likes open roads and\nfields and sunny hills. Now you can sit securely in the shade, and in\ntwo hours you can make me a pattern of that moth, for which I would pay\na designer of the arts and crafts shop five dollars, so of course you\nshall have the same.”\n\n“Oh no!” she cried in swift panic. “You were charged too much! It isn't\nworth a dollar, even!”\n\n“On the contrary the candlestick on which I shall use it will be\ninvaluable when I finish it, and five is very little for the cream of my\ndesign. I paid just right. You can earn the same for all you can do.\nIf you can embroider linen, they pay good prices for that, too and wood\ncarving, metal work, or leather things. May I see how you are coming\non?”\n\n“Please do,” she said.\n\nThe Harvester sprang up and looked over the Girl's shoulder. He could\nnot suppress an exclamation of delight.\n\n“Perfect!” he cried. “You can surpass their best drafting at the shop!\nYour fortune is made. Any time you want to go to Onabasha you can make\nenough to pay your board, dress you well, and save something every week.\nYou must leave here as soon as you can manage it. When can you go?”\n\n“I don't know,” she said wearily. “I'd hate to tell you how full\nof aches I am. I could not work much just now, if I had the best\nopportunities in the world. I must grow stronger.”\n\n“You should not work at anything until you are well,” he said. “It is a\ncrime against nature to drive yourself. Why will you not allow----”\n\n“Do you really think, with a little practice, I can draw designs that\nwill sell?”\n\nThe Harvester picked up the sheet. The work was delicate and exact. He\ncould see no way to improve it.\n\n“You know it will sell,” he said gently, “because you already have sold\nsuch work.”\n\n“But not for the prices you offer.”\n\n“The prices I name are going to be for NEW, ORIGINAL DESIGNS. I've got a\nthousand in my head, that old Mother Nature shows me in the woods and on\nthe water every day.”\n\n“But those are yours; I can't take them.”\n\n“You must,” said the Harvester. “I only see and recognize studies; I\ncan't materialize them, and until they are drawn, no one can profit by\nthem. In this partnership we revolutionize decorative art. There are\nactually birds besides fat robins and nondescript swallows. The crane\nand heron do not monopolize the water. Wild rose and golden-rod are not\nthe only flowers. The other day I was gathering lobelia. The seeds\nare used in tonic preparations. It has an upright stem with flowers\nscattered along it. In itself it is not much, but close beside it always\ngrows its cousin, tall bell-flower. As the name indicates, the flowers\nare bell shape and I can't begin to describe their grace, beauty, and\ndelicate blue colour. They ring my strongest call to worship. My work\nkeeps me in the woods so much I remain there for my religion also.\nWhenever I find these flowers I always pause for a little service of my\nown that begins by reciting these lines:\n\n     “'Neath cloistered boughs, each floral bell that swingeth\n          And tolls its perfume on the passing air,\n     Makes Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth\n          A call to prayer.”\n\n\n“Beautiful!” said the Girl.\n\n“It's mighty convenient,” explained the Harvester. “By my method, you\nsee, you don't have to wait for your day and hour of worship. Anywhere\nthe blue bell rings its call it is Sunday in the woods and in your\nheart. After I recite that, I pray my prayer.”\n\n“Go on!” said the Girl. “This is no place to stop.”\n\n“It is always one and the same prayer, and there are only two lines of\nit,” said the Harvester. “It runs this way---- Let me take your pencil\nand I will write it for you.”\n\nHe bent over her shoulder, and traced these lines on a scrap of the\nwrapping paper:\n\n               “Almighty Evolver of the Universe:\n          Help me to keep my soul and body clean,\n     And at all times to do unto others as I would be done by.\n                         Amen.”\n\n\nThe Girl took the slip and sat studying it; then she raised her eyes to\nhis face curiously, but with a tinge of awe in them.\n\n“I can see you standing over a blue, bell-shaped flower reciting those\nexquisite lines and praying this wonderful prayer,” she said. “Yesterday\nyou allowed the moth you were willing to pay five dollars for a drawing\nof, to go, because you wouldn't risk breaking its wings. Why you are\nmore like a woman!”\n\nA red stream crimsoned the Harvester's face.\n\n“Well heretofore I have been considered strictly masculine,” he said.\n“To appreciate beauty or to try to be just commonly decent is not\nexclusively feminine. You must remember there are painters, poets,\nmusicians, workers in art along almost any line you could mention, and\nno one calls them feminine, but there is one good thing if I am. You\nneed no longer fear me. If you should see me, muck covered, grubbing in\nthe earth or on a raft washing roots in the lake, you would not consider\nme like a woman.”\n\n“Would it be any discredit if I did? I think not. I merely meant that\nmost men would not see or hear the blue bell at all----and as for the\npoem and prayer! If the woods make a man with such fibre in his soul, I\nmust learn them if they half kill me.”\n\n“You harp on death. Try to forget the word.”\n\n“I have faced it for months, and seen it do its grinding worst very\nrecently to the only thing on earth I loved or that loved me. I have no\ndesire to forget! Tell me more about the plants.”\n\n“Forgive me,” said the Harvester gently. “Just now I am collecting\ncatnip for the infant and nervous people, hoarhound for colds and\ndyspepsia, boneset heads and flowers for the same purpose. There is a\nheavy head of white bloom with wonderful lacy leaves, called yarrow. I\ntake the entire plant for a tonic and blessed thistle leaves and flowers\nfor the same purpose.”\n\n“That must be what I need,” interrupted the Girl. “Half the time I\nbelieve I have a little fever, but I couldn't have dyspepsia, because I\nnever want anything to eat; perhaps the tonic would make me hungry.”\n\n“Promise me you will tell that to the doctor who comes to see your aunt,\nand take what he gives you.”\n\n“No doctor comes to see my aunt. She is merely playing lazy to get out\nof work. There is nothing the matter with her.”\n\n“Then why----”\n\n“My uncle says that. Really, she could not stand and walk across a room\nalone. She is simply worn out.”\n\n“I shall report the case,” said the Harvester instantly.\n\n“You better not!” said the Girl. “There must be a mistake about you\nknowing my uncle. Tell me more of the flowers.”\n\nThe Harvester drew a deep breath and continued:\n\n“These I just have named I take at bloom time; next month come purple\nthorn apple, jimson weed, and hemlock.”\n\n“Isn't that poison?”\n\n“Half the stuff I handle is.”\n\n“Aren't you afraid?”\n\n“Terribly,” said the Harvester in laughing voice. “But I want the money,\nthe sick folk need the medicine, and I drink water.”\n\nThe Girl laughed also.\n\n“Look here!” said the Harvester. “Why not tell me just as closely as\nyou can about your aunt, and let me fix something for her; or if you are\nafraid to trust me, let me have my friend of whom I spoke yesterday.”\n\n“Perhaps I am not so much afraid as I was,” said the Girl. “I wish I\ncould! How could I explain where I got it and I wonder if she would take\nit.”\n\n“Give it to her without any explanation,” said the Harvester. “Tell her\nit will make her stronger and she must use it. Tell me exactly how she\nis, and I will fix up some harmless remedies that may help, and can do\nno harm.”\n\n“She simply has been neglected, overworked, and abused until she has\nlain down, turned her face to the wall, and given up hope. I think it is\ntoo late. I think the end will come soon. But I wish you would try. I'll\ngladly pay----”\n\n“Don't!” said the Harvester. “Not for things that grow in the woods and\nthat I prepare. Don't think of money every minute.”\n\n“I must,” she said with forced restraint. “It is the price of life.\nWithout it one suffers----horribly----as I know. What other plants do\nyou gather?”\n\n“Saffron,” answered the Harvester. “A beautiful thing! You must see it.\nTall, round stems, lacy, delicate leaves, big heads of bright yellow\nbloom, touched with colour so dark it appears black--one of the\nloveliest plants that grows. You should see my big bed of it in a week\nor two more. It makes a picture.”\n\nThe words recalled him to the Girl. He turned to study her. He forgot\nhis commission and chafed at conventions that prevented his doing what\nhe saw was required so urgently. Fearing she would notice, he gazed away\nthrough the forest and tried to think, to plan.\n\n“You are not making noise enough,” she said.\n\nSo absorbed was the Harvester he scarcely heard her. In an attempt to\nobey he began to whistle softly. A tiny goldfinch in a nest of thistle\ndown and plant fibre in the branching of a bush ten feet above him stuck\nher head over the brim and inquired, “P'tseet?” “Pt'see!” answer the\nHarvester. That began the duet. Before the question had been asked and\nanswered a half dozen times a catbird intruded its voice and hearing a\nreply came through the bushes to investigate. A wren followed and became\nvery saucy. From----one could not see where, came a vireo, and almost at\nthe same time a chewink had something to say.\n\nInstantly the Harvester answered. Then a blue jay came chattering to\nascertain what all the fuss was about, and the Harvester carried on\na conversation that called up the remainder of the feathered tribe. A\nbrilliant cardinal came tearing through the thicket, his beady black\neyes snapping, and demanded to know if any one were harming his mate,\nbrooding under a wild grape leaf in a scrub elm on the river embankment.\nA brown thrush silently slipped like a snake between shrubs and trees,\nand catching the universal excitement, began to flirt his tail and utter\na weird, whistling cry.\n\nWith one eye on the bird, and the other on the Girl sitting in amazed\nsilence, the Harvester began working for effect. He lay quietly, but in\nturn he answered a dozen birds so accurately they thought their mates\nwere calling, and closer and closer they came. An oriole in orange and\nblack heard his challenge, and flew up the river bank, answering\nat steady intervals for quite a time before it was visible, and in\nresorting to the last notes he could think of a quail whistled “Bob\nWhite” and a shitepoke, skulking along the river bank, stopped and\ncried, “Cowk, cowk!”\n\nAt his limit of calls the Harvester changed his notes and whistled and\ncried bits of bird talk in tone with every mellow accent and inflection\nhe could manage. Gradually the excitement subsided, the birds flew and\ntilted closer, turned their sleek heads, peered with bright eyes, and\nventured on and on until the very bravest, the wren and the jay, were\nalmost in touch. Then, tired of hunting, Belshazzar came racing and the\nlittle feathered people scattered in precipitate flight.\n\n“How do you like that kind of a noise?” inquired the Harvester.\n\nThe Girl drew a deep breath.\n\n“Of course you know that was the most exquisite sight I ever saw,” she\nsaid. “I never shall forget it. I did not think there were that many\ndifferent birds in the whole world. Of all the gaudy colours! And they\ncame so close you could have reached out and touched them.”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester calmly. “Birds are never afraid of me. At\nMedicine Woods, when I call them like that, many, most of them, in fact,\neat from my hand. If you ever have looked at me enough to notice bulgy\npockets, they are full of wheat. These birds are strangers, but I'll\nwager you that in a week I can make them take food from me. Of course,\nmy own birds know me, because they are around every day. It is much\neasier to tame them in winter, when the snow has fallen and food is\nscarce, but it only takes a little while to win a bird's confidence at\nany season.”\n\n“Birds don't know what there is to be afraid of,” she said.\n\n“Your pardon,” said the Harvester, “but I am familiar with them, and\nthat is not correct. They have more to fear than human beings. No one is\ngoing to kill you merely to see if he can shoot straight enough to hit.\nYour life is not in danger because you have magnificent hair that some\nwoman would like for an ornament. You will not be stricken out in a\nflash because there are a few bits of meat on your frame some one\nwants to eat. No one will set a seductive trap for you, and, if you are\ntempted to enter it, shut you from freedom and natural diet, in a cage\nso small you can't turn around without touching bars. You are in a\nsecure and free position compared with the birds. I also have observed\nthat they know guns, many forms of traps, and all of them decide by the\nmere manner of a man's passing through the woods whether he is a friend\nor an enemy. Birds know more than many people realize. They do not\nalways correctly estimate gun range, they are foolishly venturesome\nat times when they want food, but they know many more things than most\npeople give them credit for understanding. The greatest trouble with the\nbirds is they are too willing to trust us and be friendly, so they are\noften deceived.”\n\n“That sounds as if you were right,” said the Girl.\n\n“I am of the woods, so I know I am,” answered the Harvester.\n\n“Will you look at this now?”\n\nHe examined the drawing closely.\n\n“Where did you learn?” he inquired.\n\n“My mother. She was educated to her finger tips. She drew, painted,\nplayed beautifully, sang well, and she had read almost all the best\nbooks. Besides what I learned at high school she taught me all I know.\nHer embroidery always brought higher prices than mine, try as I might. I\nnever saw any one else make such a dainty, accurate little stitch as she\ncould.”\n\n“If this is not perfect, I don't know how to criticise it. I can and\nwill use it in my work. But I have one luna cocoon remaining and I would\ngive ten dollars for such a drawing of the moth before it flies. It may\nopen to-night or not for several days. If your aunt should be worse\nand you cannot come to-morrow and the moth emerges, is there any way in\nwhich I could send it to you?”\n\n“What could I do with it?”\n\n“I thought perhaps you could take a piece of paper and the pencils with\nyou, and secure an outline in your room. It need not be worked up with\nall the detail in this. Merely a skeleton sketch would do. Could I leave\nit at the house or send it with some one?”\n\n“No! Oh no!” she cried. “Leave it here. Put it in a box in the bushes\nwhere I hid the books. What are you going to do with these things?”\n\n“Hide them in the thicket and scatter leaves over them.”\n\n“What if it rains?”\n\n“I have thought of that. I brought a few yards of oilcloth to-day and\nthey will be safe and dry if it pours.”\n\n“Good!” she said. “Then if the moth comes out you bring it, and if I\nam not here, put it under the cloth and I will run up some time in the\nafternoon. But if I were you, I would not spread the rug until you know\nif I can remain. I have to steal every minute I am away, and any day\nuncle takes a notion to stay at home I dare not come.”\n\n“Try to come to-morrow. I am going to bring some medicine for your\naunt.”\n\n“Put it under the cloth if I am not here; but I will come if I can. I\nmust go now; I have been away far too long.”\n\nThe Harvester picked up one of the drug pamphlets, laid the drawing\ninside it, and placed it with his other books. Then he drew out his\npocket book and laid a five-dollar bill on the table and began folding\nup the chair and putting away the things. The Girl looked at the money\nwith eager eyes.\n\n“Is that honestly what you would pay at the arts and crafts place?”\n\n“It is the customary price for my patterns.”\n\n“And are you sure this is as good?”\n\n“I can bring you some I have paid that for, and let you see for yourself\nthat it is better.”\n\n“I wish you would!” she cried eagerly. “I need that money, and I would\nlike to have it dearly, if I really have earned it, but I can't touch it\nif I have not.”\n\n“Won't you accept my word?”\n\n“No. I will see the other drawings first, and if I think mine are as\ngood, I will be glad to take the money to-morrow.”\n\n“What if you can't come?”\n\n“Put them under the oilcloth. I watch all the time and I think Uncle\nHenry has trained even the boys so they don't play in the river on\nhis land. I never see a soul here; the woods, house, and everything is\ndesolate until he comes home and then it is like----” she paused.\n\n“I'll say it for you,” said the Harvester promptly. “Then it is like\nhell.”\n\n“At its worst,” supplemented the Girl. Taking pencils and a sheet of\npaper she went swiftly through the woods. Before she left the shelter\nof the trees, the Harvester saw her busy her hands with the front of\nher dress, and he knew that she was concealing the drawing material. The\ncolour box was left, and he said things as he put it with the chair and\ntable, covered them with the rug and oilcloth, and heaped on a layer of\nleaves.\n\nThen he drove to the city and Betsy turned at the hospital corner\nwith no interference. He could face his friend that day. Despite\nall discouragements he felt reassured. He was progressing. Means of\ncommunication had been established. If she did not come, he could leave\na note and tell her if the moth had not emerged and how sorry he was to\nhave missed seeing her.\n\n“Hello, lover!” cried Doctor Carey as the Harvester entered the office.\n“Are you married yet?”\n\n“No. But I'm going to be,” said the Harvester with confidence.\n\n“Have you asked her?”\n\n“No. We are getting acquainted. She is too close to trouble, too ill,\nand too worried over a sick relative for me to intrude myself; it would\nbe brutal, but it's a temptation. Doc, is there any way to compel a man\nto provide medical care for his wife?”\n\n“Can he afford it?”\n\n“Amply. Anything! Worth thousands in land and nobody knows what in\nmoney. It's Henry Jameson.”\n\n“The meanest man I ever knew. If he has a wife it's a marvel she has\nsurvived this long. Won't he provide for her?”\n\n“I suppose he thinks he has when she has a bed to lie on and a roof to\ncover her. He won't supply food she can eat and medicine. He says she is\nlazy.”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\n“I quote Miss Jameson. She says her aunt is slowly dying from overwork\nand neglect.”\n\n“David, doesn't it seem pretty good, when you say 'Miss Jameson'?”\n\n“Loveliest sound on earth, except the remainder of it.”\n\n“What's that?”\n\n“Ruth!”\n\n“Jove! That is a beautiful name. Ruth Langston. It will go well, won't\nit?”\n\n“Music that the birds, insects, Singing Water, the trees, and the breeze\ncan't ever equal. I'm holding on with all my might, but it's tough, Doc.\nShe's in such a dreadful place and position, and she needs so much. She\nis sick. Can't you give me a prescription for each of them?”\n\n“You just bet I can,” said the doctor, “if you can engineer their taking\nthem.”\n\n“I suppose you'd hold their noses and pour stuff down them.”\n\n“I would if necessary.”\n\n“Well, it is.”\n\n“All right----I'll fix something, and you see that they use it.”\n\n“I can try,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Try! Pah! You aren't half a man!”\n\n“That's a half more than being a woman, anyway.”\n\n“She called you feminine, did she?” cried the doctor, dancing and\nlaughing. “She ought to see you harvesting skunk cabbage and blue flag\nor when you are angry enough.”\n\nThe doctor left the room and it was a half hour before he returned.\n\n“Try that on them according to directions,” he said, handing over a\ncouple of bottles.\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester, “I will!”\n\n“That sounds manly enough.”\n\n“Oh pother! It's not that I'm not a man, or a laggard in love; but I'd\nlike to know what you'd do to a girl dumb with grief over the recent\nloss of her mother, who was her only relative worth counting, sick from\nGod knows what exposure and privation, and now a dying relative on her\nhands. What could you do?”\n\n“I'd marry her and pick her out of it!”\n\n“I wouldn't have her, if she'd leave a sick woman for me!”\n\n“I wouldn't either. She's got to stick it out until her aunt grows\nbetter, and then I'll go out there and show you how to court a girl.”\n\n“I guess not! You keep the girl you did court, courted, and you'll have\nyour hands full. How does that appear to you?”\n\nThe Harvester opened the pamphlet he carried and held up the drawing of\nthe moth.\n\nThe doctor turned to the light.\n\n“Good work!” he cried. “Did she do that?”\n\n“She did. In a little over an hour.”\n\n“Fine! She should have a chance.”\n\n“She is going to. She is going to have all the opportunity that is\ncoming to her.”\n\n“Good for you, David! Any time I can help!”\n\nThe Harvester replaced the sketch and went to the wagon; but he left\nBelshazzar in charge, and visited the largest dry goods store in\nOnabasha, where he held a conference with the floor walker. When he came\nout he carried a heaping load of boxes of every size and shape, with a\nlabel on each. He drove to Medicine Woods singing and whistling.\n\n“She didn't want me to go, Belshazzar!” he chuckled to the dog. “She was\nmore afraid of a cow than she was of me. I made some headway to-day, old\nboy. She doesn't seem to have a ray of an idea what I am there for, but\nshe is going to trust me soon now; that is written in the books. Oh I\nhope she will be there to-morrow, and the luna will be out. Got half a\nnotion to take the case and lay it in the warmest place I can find.\nBut if it comes out and she isn't there, I'll be sorry. Better trust to\nluck.”\n\nThe Harvester stabled Betsy, fed the stock, and visited with the birds.\nAfter supper he took his purchases and entered her room. He opened the\ndrawers of the chest he had made, and selecting the labelled boxes he\nlaid them in. But not a package did he open. Then he arose and radiated\nconceit of himself.\n\n“I'll wager she will like those,” he commented proudly, “because Kane\npromised me fairly that he would have the right things put up for a girl\nthe size of the clerk I selected for him, and exactly what Ruth should\nhave. That girl was slenderer and not quite so tall, but he said\neverything was made long on purpose. Now what else should I get?”\n\nHe turned to the dressing table and taking a notebook from his pocket\nmade this list:\n\n     Rugs for bed and bath room.\n     Mattresses, pillows and bedding,\n     Dresses for all occasions.\n     All kinds of shoes and overshoes.\n\n\n“There are gloves, too!” exclaimed the Harvester. “She has to have some,\nbut how am I going to know what is right? Oh, but she needs shoes!\nHigh, low, slippers, everything! I wonder what that clerk wears. I don't\nbelieve shoes would be comfortable without being fitted, or at least the\nproper size. I wonder what kind of dresses she likes. I hope she's fond\nof white. A woman always appears loveliest in that. Maybe I'd better buy\nwhat I'm sure of and let her select the dresses. But I'd love to have\nthis room crammed with girl-fixings when she comes. Doesn't seem as\nif she ever has had any little luxuries. I can't miss it on anything a\nwoman uses. Let me think!”\n\nSlowly he wrote again:\n\n          Parasols.\n          Fans.\n          Veils.\n          Hats.\n\n\n“I never can get them! I think that will keep me busy for a few days,”\n said the Harvester as he closed the door softly, and went to look at\nthe pupae cases. Then he carved on the vine of the candlestick for her\ndressing table; with one arm around Belshazzar, re-read the story of\nJohn Muir's dog, went into the lake, and to bed. Just as he was becoming\nunconscious the beast lifted an inquiring head and gazed at the man.\n\n“More 'fraid of cow,” the Harvester was muttering in a sleepy chuckle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. DEMONSTRATED COURTSHIP\n\nWhen the Harvester saw the Girl coming toward the woods, he spread the\nrug, opened and placed the table and chair, laid out the colour box, and\nanother containing the last luna.\n\n“Did the green one come out?” she asked, touching the box lightly.\n\n“It did!” said the Harvester proudly, as if he were responsible for the\nperformance. “It is an omen! It means that I am to have my long-coveted\npattern for my best candlestick. It also clearly indicates that the\ngods of luck are with me for the day, and I get my way about everything.\nThere won't be the least use in your asking 'why' or interposing\nobjections. This is my clean sweep. I shall be fearfully dictatorial and\nyou must submit, because the fates have pointed out that they favour\nme to-day, and if you go contrary to their decrees you will have a bad\ntime.”\n\nThe Girl's smile was a little wan. She sank on a chair and picked up a\npencil.\n\n“Lay that down!” cried the Harvester. “You haven't had permission from\nthe Dictator to begin drawing. You are to sit and rest a long time.”\n\n“Please may I speak?” asked the Girl.\n\nThe Harvester grew foolishly happy. Was she really going to play the\ngame? Of course he had hoped, but it was a hope without any foundation.\n\n“You may,” he said soberly.\n\n“I am afraid that if you don't allow me to draw the moth at once, I'll\nnever get it done. I dislike to mention it on your good day, but Aunt\nMolly is very restless. I got a neighbour's little girl to watch her and\ncall me if I'm wanted. It's quite certain that I must go soon, so if you\nwould like the moth----”\n\n“When luck is coming your way, never hurry it! You always upset the bowl\nif you grow greedy and crowd. If it is a gamble whether I get this moth,\nI'll take the chance; but I won't change my foreordained programme for\nthis afternoon. First, you are to sit still ten minutes, shut your eyes,\nand rest. I can't sing, but I can whistle, and I'm going to entertain\nyou so you won't feel alone. Ready now!”\n\nThe Girl leaned her elbows on the table, closed her eyes, and pressed\nher slender white hands over them.\n\n“Please don't call the birds,” she said. “I can't rest if you do. It was\nso exciting trying to see all of them and guess what they were saying.”\n\n“No,” said the Harvester gently. “This ten minutes is for relaxation,\nyou know. You ease every muscle, sink limply on your chair, lean on the\ntable, let go all over, and don't think. Just listen to me. I assure you\nit's going to be perfectly lovely.”\n\nWatching intently he saw the strained muscles relaxing at his suggestion\nand caught the smile over the last words as he slid into a soft whistle.\nIt was an easy, slow, old-fashioned tune, carrying along gently, with\nneither heights nor depths, just monotonous, sleepy, soothing notes,\nthat went on and on with a little ripple of change at times, only to\nreturn to the theme, until at last the Girl lifted her head.\n\n“It's away past ten minutes,” she said, “but that was a real rest.\nTruly, I am better prepared for work.”\n\n“Broke the rule, too!” said the Harvester. “It was, for me to say when\ntime was up. Can't you allow me to have my way for ten minutes?”\n\n“I am so anxious to see and draw this moth,” she answered. “And first of\nall you promised to bring the drawings you have been using.”\n\n“Now where does my programme come in?” inquired the Harvester. “You are\nspoiling everything, and I refuse to have my lucky day interfered with;\ntherefore we will ignore the suggestion until we arrive at the place\nwhere it is proper. Next thing is refreshments.”\n\nHe arose and coming over cleared the table. Then he spread on it a paper\ntray cloth with a gay border, and going into the thicket brought out\na box and a big bucket containing a jug packed in ice. The Girl's eyes\nwidened. She reached down, caught up a piece, and holding it to drip a\nsecond started to put it in her mouth.\n\n“Drop that!” commanded the Harvester. “That's a very unhealthful\nproceeding. Wait a minute.”\n\nFrom one end of the box he produced a tin of wafers and from the other\na plate. Then he dug into the ice and lifted several different varieties\nof chilled fruit. From the jug he poured a combination that he made of\nthe juices of oranges, pineapples, and lemons. He set the glass, rapidly\nfrosting in the heat, and the fruit before the Girl.\n\n“Now!” he said.\n\nFor one instant she stared at the table. Then she looked at him and in\nthe depths of her dark eyes was an appeal he never forgot.\n\n“I made that drink myself, so it's all right,” he assured her. “There's\na pretty stiff touch of pineapple in it, and it cuts the cobwebs on a\nhot day. Please try it!”\n\n“I can't!” cried the Girl with a half-sob. “Think of Aunt Molly!”\n\n“Are you fond of her?”\n\n“No. I never saw her until a few weeks ago. Since then I've seen nothing\nsave her poor, tired back. She lies in a heap facing the wall. But if\nshe could have things like these, she needn't suffer. And if my mother\ncould have had them she would be living to-day. Oh Man, I can't touch\nthis.”\n\n“I see,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe reached over, picked up the glass, and poured its contents into the\njug. He repacked the fruit and closed the wafer box. Then he made a trip\nto the thicket and came out putting something into his pocket.\n\n“Come on!” he said. “We are going to the house.”\n\nShe stared at him.\n\n“I simply don't dare.”\n\n“Then I will go alone,” said the Harvester, picking up the bucket and\nstarting.\n\nThe Girl followed him.\n\n“Uncle Henry may come any minute,” she urged.\n\n“Well if he comes and acts unpleasantly, he will get what he richly\ndeserves.”\n\n“And he will make me pay for it afterward.”\n\n“Oh no he won't!” said the Harvester, “because I'll look out for that.\nThis is my lucky day. He isn't going to come.”\n\nWhen he reached the back door he opened it and stepped inside. Of all\nthe barren places of crude, disheartening ugliness the Harvester ever\nhad seen, that was the worst.\n\n“I want a glass and a spoon,” he said.\n\nThe Girl brought them.\n\n“Where is she?”\n\n“In the next room.”\n\nAt the sound of their voices a small girl came to the kitchen door.\n\n“How do you do?” inquired the Harvester. “Is Mrs. Jameson asleep?”\n\n“I don't know,” answered the child. “She just lies there.”\n\nThe Harvester gave her the glass. “Please fill that with water,” he\nsaid. Then he picked up the bucket and went into the front room. When\nthe child came with the water he took a bottle from his pocket, filled\nthe spoon, and handed it to her.\n\n“Hold that steadily,” he said.\n\nThen he slid his strong hands under the light frame and turned the face\nof the faded little creature toward him.\n\n“I am a Medicine Man, Mrs. Jameson,” he said casually. “I heard you were\nsick and I came to see if a little of this stuff wouldn't brace you up.\nOpen your lips.”\n\nHe held out the spoon and the amazed woman swallowed the contents before\nshe realized what she was doing. Then the Harvester ran a hand under\nher shoulders and lifting her gently he tossed her pillow with the other\nhand.\n\n“You are a light little body, just like my mother,” he commented. “Now I\nhave something else sick people sometimes enjoy.”\n\nHe held the fruit juice to her lips as he slightly raised her on the\npillow. Her trembling fingers lifted and closed around the sparkling\nglass.\n\n“Oh it's cool!” she gasped.\n\n“It is,” said the Harvester, “and sour! I think you can taste it. Try!”\n\nShe drank so greedily he drew away the glass and urged caution, but the\nshaking fingers clung to him and the wavering voice begged for more.\n\n“In a minute,” said the Harvester gently. But the fevered woman would\nnot wait. She drank the cooling liquid until she could take no more.\nThen she watched him fill a small pitcher and pack it in a part of the\nice and lay some fruit around it.\n\n“Who, Ruth?” she panted.\n\n“A Medicine Man who heard about you.”\n\n“What will Henry say?”\n\n“He won't know,” explained the Girl, smoothing the hot forehead. “I'll\nput it in the cupboard, and slip it to you while he is out of the room.\nIt will make you strong and well.”\n\n“I don't want to be strong and well and suffer it all over again. I want\nto rest. Give me more of the cool drink. Give me all I want, then I'll\ngo to sleep.”\n\n“It's wonderful,” said the Girl. “That's more than I've heard her talk\nsince I came. She is much stronger. Please let her have it.”\n\nThe Harvester assented. He gave the child some of the fruit, and told\nher to sit beside the bed and hold the drink when it was asked for. She\nagreed to be very careful and watchful. Then he picked up the bucket,\nand followed by the Girl, returned to the woods.\n\n“Now we have to begin all over again,” he said, as she seated herself at\nthe table. “Because of the walk in the heat, this time the programme is\na little different.”\n\nHe replaced the wafer box and opened it, filled the glass, and heaped\nthe cold fruit.\n\n“Your aunt is going to have a refreshing sleep now,” he said, “and\nyour mind can be free about her for an hour or two. I am very sure your\nmother would not want you deprived of anything because she missed it, so\nyou are to enjoy this, if you care for it. At least try a sample.”\n\nThe Girl lifted the glass to her lips with a trembling hand.\n\n“I'm like Aunt Molly,” she said; “I wish I could drink all I could\nswallow, and then lie down and go to sleep forever. I suppose this is\nwhat they have in Heaven.”\n\n“No, it's what they drink all over earth at present, but I have a\nconceit of my own brand. Some of it is too strong of one fruit or of the\nother, and all too sweet for health. This is compounded scientifically\nand it's just right. If you are not accustomed to cold drinks, go\nslowly.”\n\n“You can't scare me,” said the Girl; “I'm going to drink all I want.”\n\nThere was a note of excitement in the Harvester's laugh.\n\n“You must have some, too!”\n\n“After a while,” he said. “I was thirsty when I made it, so I don't care\nfor any more now. Try the fruit and those wafers. Of course they are not\nhome made--they are the best I could do at a bakery. Take time enough to\neat slowly. I'm going to tell you a tale while you lunch, and it's about\na Medicine Man named David Langston. It's a very peculiar story,\nbut it's quite true. This man lives in the woods east of Onabasha,\naccompanied by his dog, horse, cow, and chickens, and a forest full of\nbirds, flowers, and matchless trees. He has lived there in this manner\nfor six long years, and every spring he and his dog have a seance and\nagree whether he shall go on gathering medicinal herbs and trying his\nhand at making medicine or go to the city and live as other men. Always\nthe dog chooses to remain in the woods.\n\n“Then every spring, on the day the first bluebird comes, the dog also\ndecides whether the man shall go on alone or find a mate and bring her\nhome for company. Each year the dog regularly has decided that they live\nas always. This spring, for some unforeseen reason, he changed his mind,\nand compelled the man, according to his vow in the beginning, to go\ncourting. The man was so very angry at the idea of having a woman in\nhis home, interfering with his work, disturbing his arrangements, and\nperhaps wanting to spend more money than he could afford, that he struck\nthe dog for making that decision; struck him for the very first time in\nhis life----I believe you'd like those apricots. Please try one.”\n\n“Go on with the story,” said the Girl, sipping delicately but constantly\nat the frosty glass.\n\nThe Harvester arose and refilled it. Then he dropped pieces of ice over\nthe fruit.\n\n“Where was I?” he inquired casually.\n\n“Where you struck Belshazzar, and it's no wonder,” answered the Girl.\n\nWithout taking time to ponder that, the Harvester continued:\n\n“But that night the man had a wonderful, golden dream. A beautiful girl\ncame to him, and she was so gracious and lovely that he was sufficiently\npunished for striking his dog, because he fell unalterably in love with\nher.”\n\n“Meaning you?” interrupted the Girl.\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester, “meaning me. I----if you like----fell in love\nwith the girl. She came so alluringly, and I was so close to her that\nI saw her better than I ever did any other girl, and I knew her for all\ntime. When she went, my heart was gone.”\n\n“And you have lived without that important organ ever since?”\n\n“Without even the ghost of it! She took it with her. Well, that dream\nwas so real, that the next day I began building over my house, making\nfurniture, and planting flowers for her; and every day, wherever I went,\nI watched for her.”\n\n“What nonsense!”\n\n“I can't see it.”\n\n“You won't find a girl you dreamed about in a thousand years.”\n\n“Wrong!” cried the Harvester triumphantly. “Saw her in little less than\nthree months, but she vanished and it took some time and difficult work\nbefore I located her again; but I've got her all solid now, and she\ndoesn't escape.”\n\n“Is she a 'lovely and gracious lady'?”\n\n“She is!” said the Harvester, with all his heart.\n\n“Young and beautiful, of course!”\n\n“Indeed yes!”\n\n“Please fill this glass. I told you what I was going to do.”\n\nThe Harvester refilled the glass and the Girl drained it.\n\n“Now won't you set aside these things and allow me to go to work?” she\nasked. “My call may come any minute, and I'll never forgive myself if I\nwaste time, and don't draw your moth pattern for you.”\n\n“It's against my principles to hurry, and besides, my story isn't\nfinished.”\n\n“It is,” said the Girl. “She is young and lovely, gentle and a lady, you\nhave her 'all solid,' and she can't 'escape'; that's the end, of course.\nBut if I were you, I wouldn't have her until I gave her a chance to get\naway, and saw whether she would if she could.”\n\n“Oh I am not a jailer,” said the Harvester. “She shall be free if I\ncannot make her love me; but I can, and I will; I swear it.”\n\n“You are not truly in earnest?”\n\n“I am in deadly earnest.”\n\n“Honestly, you dreamed about a girl, and found the very one?”\n\n“Most certainly, I did.”\n\n“It sounds like the wildest romancing.”\n\n“It is the veriest reality.”\n\n“Well I hope you win her, and that she will be everything you desire.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the Harvester. “It's written in the book of fate\nthat I succeed. The very elements are with me. The South Wind carried\na message to her for me. I am going to marry her, but you could make it\nmuch easier for me if you would.”\n\n“I! What could I do?” cried the Girl.\n\n“You could cease being afraid of me. You could learn to trust me. You\ncould try to like me, if you see anything likeable about me. That would\nencourage me so that I could tell you of my Dream Girl, and then you\ncould show me how to win her. A woman always knows about those things\nbetter than a man. You could be the greatest help in all the world to\nme, if only you would.”\n\n“I couldn't possibly! I can't leave here. I have no proper clothing to\nappear before another girl. She would be shocked at my white face. That\nI could help you is the most improbable dream you have had.”\n\n“You must pardon me if I differ from you, and persist in thinking that\nyou can be of invaluable assistance to me, if you will. But you can't\ninfluence my Dream Girl, if you fear and distrust me yourself. Promise\nme that you will help me that much, anyway.”\n\n“I'll do all I can. I only want to make you see that I am in no position\nto grant any favours, no matter how much I owe you or how I'd like to.\nIs the candlestick you are carving for her?”\n\n“It is,” said the Harvester. “I am making a pair of maple to stand on a\ndressing table I built for her. It is unusually beautiful wood, I think,\nand I hope she will be pleased with it.”\n\n“Please take these things away and let me begin. This is the only thing\nI can see that I can do for you, and the moth will want to fly before I\nhave finished.”\n\nThe Harvester cleared the table and placed the box, while the Girl\nspread the paper and began work eagerly.\n\n“I wonder if I knew there were such exquisite things in all the world,”\n she said. “I scarcely think I did. I am beginning to understand why you\ncouldn't kill one. You could make a chair or a table, and so you feel\nfree to destroy them; but it takes ages and Almighty wisdom to evolve a\ncreature like this, so you don't dare. I think no one else would if they\nreally knew. Please talk while I work.”\n\n“Is there a particular subject you want discussed?”\n\n“Anything but her. If I think too strongly of her, I can't work so\nwell.”\n\n“Your ginseng is almost dry,” said the Harvester. “I think I can bring\nyou the money in a few days.”\n\n“So soon!” she cried.\n\n“It dries day and night in an even temperature, and faster than you\nwould believe. There's going to be between seven and eight pounds of\nit, when I make up what it has shrunk. It will go under the head of the\nfinest wild roots. I can get eight for it sure.”\n\n“Oh what good news!” cried the Girl. “This is my lucky day, too. And the\nlittle girl isn't coming, so Aunt Molly must be asleep. Everything goes\nright! If only Uncle Henry wouldn't come home!”\n\n“Let me fill your glass,” proffered the Harvester.\n\n“Just half way, and set it where I can see it,” said the Girl. She\nworked with swift strokes and there was a hint of colour in her face, as\nshe looked at him. “I hope you won't think I'm greedy,” she said, “but\ntruly, that's the first thing I've had that I could taste in----I can't\nremember when.”\n\n“I'll bring a barrel to-morrow,” offered the Harvester, “and a big piece\nof ice wrapped in coffee sacking.”\n\n“You mustn't think of such a thing! Ice is expensive and so are fruits.”\n\n“Ice costs me the time required to saw and pack it at my home. I almost\nlive on the fruit I raise. I confess to a fondness for this drink. I\nhave no other personal expenses, unless you count in books, and a very\nfew clothes, such as I'm wearing; so I surely can afford all the fruit\njuice I want.”\n\n“For yourself, yes.”\n\n“Also for a couple of women or I am a mighty poor attempt at a man,”\n said the Harvester. “This is my day, so you are not to talk, because it\nwon't do any good. Things go my way.”\n\n“Please see what you think of this,” she said.\n\nThe Harvester arose and bent over her.\n\n“That will do finely,” he answered. “You can stop. I don't require all\nthose little details for carving, I just want a good outline. It is\nfinished. See here!”\n\nHe drew some folded papers from his pocket and laid them before her.\n\n“Those are what I have been working from,” he said.\n\nThe Girl took them and studied each carefully.\n\n“If those are worth five dollars to you,” she said gently, “why then I\nneedn't hesitate to take as much for mine. They are superior.”\n\n“I should say so,” laughed the Harvester as he took up the drawing and\nlaid down the money.\n\n“If you would make it half that much I'd feel better about it,” she\nsaid.\n\n“How could I?” asked the Harvester. “Your fingers are well trained and\nextremely skilful. Because some one has not been paying you enough for\nyour work is no reason why I should keep it up. From now on you must\nhave what others get. As soon as you can arrange for work, I want to\ntell you about some designs I have studied out from different things,\nshow you the plants and insects, and have you make some samples. I'll\nsend them to proper places, and see what experts say about the ideas and\ndrawing. Work in the woods is healthful, with proper precautions;\nit's easy compared with the exactions of being bound to sewing or\nembroidering in the confinement of a room; it's vividly interesting\nin the search for new subjects, changes of material, and differing\nharmonious combinations; it's truly artistic; and it brings the prices\nhigh grade stuff always does.”\n\n“Almost you give me hope,” said the Girl. “Almost, Man----almost! Since\nmother died, I haven't thought or planned beyond paying for the medicine\nshe took and the shelter she lies in. Oh I didn't mean to say that----!”\n\nShe buried her face in her hands. The Harvester suffered until he\nscarcely knew how to bear it.\n\n“Please finish,” he begged. “You hadn't planned beyond the debt, you\nwere saying----”\n\nThe Girl lifted her tired, strained face.\n\n“Give me a little more of that delicious drink,” she said. “I am\nravenous for it. It puts new life in me. This and what you say bring a\nfar away, misty vision of a clean, bright, peaceful room somewhere, and\nwork one could love and live on in comfort; enough to give a desire to\nfinish life to its natural end. Oh Man, you make me hope in spite of\nmyself!”\n\n“'Praise God from whom all blessings flow;'” quoted the Harvester\nreverently. “Now try one of these peaches. It's juicy and cold. Get that\nroom right in focus in your brain, and nurture the idea. Its walls shall\nbe bright as sunshine, its floor creamy white, and it shall open into a\nlittle garden, where only yellow flowers grow, and the birds shall sing.\nThe first ray of sun that peeps over the hills of morning shall fall\nthrough its windows across your bed, and you shall work only as you\nplease, after you've had months of play and rest; and it's coming true\nthe instant you can leave here. Dream of it, make up your mind to it,\nbecause it's coming. I have a little streak of second sight, and I see\nit on the way.”\n\n“You are talking wildly,” said the Girl, “else you are a good genie\ntrying to conjure a room for me.”\n\n“This room I am talking of is ready whenever you want to take\npossession,” said the Harvester. “Accept it as a reality, because I tell\nyou I know where it is, that it is waiting, and you can earn your way\ninto it with no obligation to any one.”\n\nThe Girl stretched out her right hand and slowly turned and opened and\nclosed it. Then she glanced at the Harvester with a weary smile.\n\n“From somewhere I feel a glimmering of the spirit, but Oh, dear Lord,\nthe flesh is weak!” she said.\n\n“That's where nourishing foods, appetizing drinks, plenty of pure, fresh\nair, and good water come in. Now we have talked enough for one day, and\nworked too much. The fruit and drink go with you. I will carry it to the\nhouse, and you can hide it in your room. I am going to put a bottle of\ntonic on top that the best surgeon in the state gave me for you. Try to\neat something strengthening and then take a spoonful of this, and use\nall the fruit you want. I'll bring more to-morrow and put it here, with\nplenty of ice. Now suppose you let the moth go free,” he suggested to\navoid objections. “You must take my word for it, that it is perfectly\nharmless, lacking either sting or bite, and hold your hand before it, so\nthat it will climb on your fingers. Then stand where a ray of sunshine\nfalls and in a few minutes it will go out to live its life.”\n\nThe Girl hesitated a second as she studied the clean-cut, interested\nface of the man; then she held out her hand, and he urged the moth to\nclimb on her fingers. She stepped where a ray of strong light fell on\nthe forest floor and held the moth in it. The brightness also touched\nher transparent hand and white face and the gleaming black hair. The\nHarvester choked down a rising surge of desire for her, and took a new\ngrip on himself.\n\n“Oh!” she cried breathlessly, as the clinging feet suddenly loosened and\nthe luna slowly flew away among the trees. She turned on the Harvester.\n“You teach me wonders!” she cried. “You give life different meanings.\nYou are not as other men.”\n\n“If that be true, it is because I am of the woods. The Almighty does not\nevolve all his wonders in animal, bird, and flower form; He keeps some\nto work out in the heart, if humanity only will go to His school, and\nallow Him to have dominion. Come now, you must go. I will come back and\nput away all the things and tomorrow I will bring your ginseng money.\nAny time you cannot come, if you want to tell me why, or if there is\nanything I can do for you, put a line under the oilcloth. I will carry\nthe bucket.”\n\n“I am so afraid,” she said.\n\n“I will only go to the edge of the woods. You can see if there is any\none at the house first. If not, you can send the child away, and then I\nwill carry the bucket to the door for you, and it will furnish comfort\nfor one night, at least.”\n\nThey went to the cleared land and the Girl passed on alone. Soon she\nreappeared and the Harvester saw the child going down the road. He took\nup the bucket and set it inside the door.\n\n“Is there anything I can do for you?”\n\n“Nothing but go, before you make trouble.”\n\n“Will you hide that stuff and walk back as far as the woods with me?\nThere is something more I want to say to you.”\n\nThe Girl staggered under the heavy load, and the man turned his head and\ntried to pretend he did not see. Presently she came out to him, and they\nreturned to the line of the woods. Just as they entered the shade there\nwas a flash before them, and on a twig a few rods away a little gray\nbird alighted, while in precipitate pursuit came a flaming wonder of\nred, and in a burst of excited trills, broken whistles, and imploring\ngestures, perched beside her.\n\nThe Harvester hastily drew the Girl behind some bushes.\n\n“Watch!” he whispered. “You are going to see a sight so lovely and so\nrare it is vouchsafed to few mortals ever to behold.”\n\n“What are they fighting about?” she whispered.\n\n“You are witnessing a cardinal bird declare his love,” breathed the\nHarvester.\n\n“Do cardinals love different birds?”\n\n“No. The female is gray, because if she is coloured the same as the\ntrees and branches and her nest, she will have more chance to bring off\nher young in safety. He is blood red, because he is the bravest, gayest,\nmost ardent lover of the whole woods,” explained the Harvester.\n\nThe Girl leaned forward breathlessly watching and a slow surge of colour\ncrept into her cheeks. The red bird twisted, whistled, rocked, tilted,\nand trilled, and the gray sat demurely watching him, as if only half\nconvinced he really meant it. The gay lover began at the beginning and\nsaid it all over again with more impassioned gestures than before, and\nthen he edged in touch and softly stroked her wing with his beak.\nShe appeared startled, but did not fly. So again the fountain of\nhalf-whistled, half-trilled notes bubbled with the acme of pleading\nintonation and that time he leaned and softly kissed her as she reached\nher bill for the caress. Then she fled in headlong flight, while the\nstreak of flame darted after her. The Girl caught her breath in a swift\nspasm of surprise and wonder. She turned to the Harvester.\n\n“What was it you wanted to say to me?” she asked hurriedly.\n\nThe Harvester was not the man to miss the goods the gods provided. Truly\nthis was his lucky day. Unhesitatingly he took the plunge.\n\n“Precisely what he said to her. And if you observed closely, you noticed\nthat she didn't ask him 'why.'”\n\nBefore she could open her lips, he was gone, his swift strides carrying\nhim through the woods.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. “THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A MAID”\n\nThe next day the Harvester lifted the oilcloth, and picking up a folded\nnote he read----\n\n“Aunt Molly found rest in the night. She was more comfortable than she\nhad been since I have known her. Close the end she whispered to me to\nthank you if I ever saw you again. She will be buried to-morrow. Past\nthat, I dare not think.”\n\nThe Harvester sat on the log and studied the lines. She would not come\nthat day or the next. After a long time he put the note in his pocket,\nwrote an answer telling her he had been there, and would come on the\nfollowing day on the chance of her wanting anything he could do, and the\nnext he would bring the ginseng money, so she must be sure to meet him.\n\nThen he went back to the wagon, turned Betsy, and drove around the\nJameson land watching closely. There were several vehicles in the barn\nlot, and a couple of men sitting under the trees of the door yard. Faded\nbedding hung on the line and women moved through the rooms, but he could\nnot see the Girl. Slowly he drove on until he came to the first house,\nand there he stopped and went in. He saw the child of the previous day,\nand as she came forward her mother appeared in the doorway.\n\nThe Harvester explained who he was and that he was examining the woods\nin search of some almost extinct herbs he needed in his business.\nThen he told of having been at the adjoining farm the day before and\nmentioned the sick woman. He added that later she had died. He casually\nmentioned that a young woman there seemed pale and ill and wondered\nif the neighbours would see her through. He suggested that the place\nappeared as if the owner did not take much interest, and when the woman\nfinished with Henry Jameson, he said how very important it seemed to him\nthat some good, kind-hearted soul should go and mother the poor girl,\nand the woman thought she was the very person. Without knowing exactly\nhow he did it, the Harvester left with her promise to remain with the\nGirl the coming two nights. The woman had her hands full of strange and\ndelicious fruit without understanding why it had been given her, or why\nshe had made those promises. She thought the Harvester a remarkably fine\nyoung man to take such interest in strangers and she told him he was\nwelcome to anything he could find on her place that would help with his\nmedicines.\n\nThe Harvester just happened to be coming from the woods as the woman\nfreshly dressed left the house, so he took her in the wagon and drove\nback to the Jameson place, because he was going that way. Then he\nreturned to Medicine Woods and worked with all his might.\n\nFirst he polished floors, cleaned windows, and arranged the rooms\nas best he could inside the cabin; then he gave a finishing touch to\neverything outside. He could not have told why he did it, but he thought\nit was because there was hope that now the Girl would come to Onabasha.\nIf he found opportunity to bring her to the city, he hoped that possibly\nhe might drive home with her and show Medicine Woods, so everything\nmust be in order. Then he worked with flying fingers in the dry-house,\nputting up her ginseng for market, and never was weight so liberal.\n\nThe next morning he drove early to Onabasha and came home with a loaded\nwagon, the contents of which he scattered through the cabin where it\nseemed most suitable, but the greater part of it was for her. He glanced\nat the bare floors and walls of the other rooms, and thought of trying\nto improve them, but he was afraid of not getting the right things.\n\n“I don't know much about what is needed here,” he said, “but I am\nperfectly safe in buying anything a girl ever used.”\n\nThen he returned to the city, explained the situation to the doctor, and\nselected the room he wanted in case the Girl could be persuaded to come\nto the hospital. After that he went to see the doctor's wife, and\nmade arrangements for her to be ready for a guest, because there was a\npossibility he might want to call for help. He had another jug of fruit\njuice and all the delicacies he could think of, also a big cake of ice,\nwhen he reached the woods. There were only a few words for him.\n\n“I will come to-morrow at two, if at all possible; if not, keep the\nmoney until I can.”\n\nThere was nothing to do except to place his offering under the oilcloth\nand wait, but he simply was compelled to add a line to say he would be\nthere, and to express the hope that she was comfortable as possible and\nthinking of the sunshine room. Then he returned to Medicine Woods to\nwait, and found that possible only by working to exhaustion. There were\nmany things he could do, and one after another he finished them, until\ncompletely worn out; and then he slept the deep sleep of weariness.\n\nAt noon the next day he bathed, shaved, and dressed in fresh, clean\nclothing. He stopped in Onabasha for more fruit, and drove to the\nJameson woods. He was waiting and watching the usual path the Girl\nfollowed, when her step sounded on the other side. The Harvester arose\nand turned. Her pallor was alarming. She stepped on the rug he had\nspread, and sank almost breathless to the chair.\n\n“Why do you come a new way that fills you with fear?” asked the\nHarvester.\n\n“It seems as if Uncle Henry is watching me every minute, and I didn't\ndare come where he could see. I must not remain a second. You must take\nthese things away and go at once. He is dreadful.”\n\n“So am I,” said the Harvester, “when affairs go too everlastingly wrong.\nI am not afraid of any man living. What are you planning to do?”\n\n“I want to ask you, are you sure about the prices of my drawing and the\nginseng?”\n\n“Absolutely,” said the Harvester. “As for the ginseng it went in fresh\nand early, best wild roots, and it brought eight a pound. There were\neight pounds when I made up weight and here is your money.”\n\nHe handed her a long envelope addressed to her.\n\n“What is the amount?” she asked.\n\n“Sixty-four dollars.”\n\n“I can't believe it.”\n\n“You have it in your fingers.”\n\n“You know that I would like to thank you properly, if I had words to\nexpress myself.”\n\n“Never mind that,” said the Harvester. “Tell me what you are planning.\nSay that you will come to the hospital for the long, perfect rest now.”\n\n“It is absolutely impossible. Don't weary me by mentioning it. I\ncannot.”\n\n“Will you tell me what you intend doing?”\n\n“I must,” she said, “for it depends entirely on your word. I am going\nto get Uncle Henry's supper, and then go and remain the night with the\nneighbour who has been helping me. In the morning, when he leaves, she\nis coming with her wagon for my trunk, and she is going to drive with me\nto Onabasha and find me a cheap room and loan me a few things, until I\ncan buy what I need. I am going to use fourteen dollars of this and my\ndrawing money for what I am forced to buy, and pay fifty on my debt.\nThen I will send you my address and be ready for work.”\n\nShe clutched the envelope and for the first time looked at him.\n\n“Very well,” said the Harvester. “I could take you to the wife of my\nbest friend, the chief surgeon of the city hospital, and everything\nwould be ease and rest until you are strong; she would love to have\nyou.”\n\nThe Girl dropped her hands wearily.\n\n“Don't tire me with it!” she cried. “I am almost falling despite the\nstimulus of food and drink I can touch. I never can thank you properly\nfor that. I won't be able to work hard enough to show you how much I\nappreciate what you have done for me. But you don't understand. A woman,\neven a poverty-poor woman, if she be delicately born and reared, cannot\ngo to another woman on a man's whim, and when she lacks even the barest\nnecessities. I don't refuse to meet your friends. I shall love to, when\nI can be so dressed that I will not shame you. Until that times comes,\nif you are the gentleman you appear to be, you will wait without urging\nme further.”\n\n“I must be a man, in order to be a gentleman,” said the Harvester. “And\nit is because the man in me is in hot rebellion against more loneliness,\npain, and suffering for you, that the conventions become chains I do not\ncare how soon or how roughly I break. If only you could be induced to\nsay the word, I tell you I could bring one of God's gentlest women to\nyou.”\n\n“And probably she would come in a dainty gown, in her carriage or motor,\nand be disgusted, astonished, and secretly sorry for you. As for me, I\ndo not require her pity. I will be glad to know the beautiful, refined,\nand gentle woman you are so certain of, but not until I am better\ndressed and more attractive in appearance than now. If you will give me\nyour address, I will write you when I am ready for work.”\n\nSilently the Harvester wrote it. “Will you give me permission to take\nthese things to your neighbour for you?” he asked. “They would serve\nuntil you can do better, and I have no earthly use for them.”\n\nShe hesitated. Then she laughed shortly.\n\n“What a travesty my efforts at pride are with you!” she cried. “I begin\nby trying to preserve some proper dignity, and end by confessing abject\npoverty. I yet have the ten you paid me the other day, but twenty-four\ndollars are not much to set up housekeeping on, and I would be more glad\nthan I can say for these very things.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the Harvester. “I will take them when I go. Is there\nanything else?”\n\n“I think not.”\n\n“Will you have a drink?”\n\n“Yes, if you have more with you. I believe it is really cooling my\nblood.”\n\n“Are you taking the medicine?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “and I am stronger. Truly I am. I know I appear ghastly\nto you, but it's loss of sleep, and trying to lay away poor Aunt Molly\ndecently, and----”\n\n“And fear of Uncle Henry,” added the Harvester.\n\n“Yes,” said the Girl. “That most of all! He thinks I am going to stay\nhere and take her place. I can't tell him I am not, and how I am to hide\nfrom him when I am gone, I don't know. I am afraid of him.”\n\n“Has he any claim on you?”\n\n“Shelter for the past three months.”\n\n“Are you of age?”\n\n“I am almost twenty-four,” she said.\n\n“Then suppose you leave Uncle Henry to me,” suggested the Harvester.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Careful now! The red bird told you why!” said the man. “I will not\nurge it upon you now, but keep it steadily in the back of your head that\nthere is a sunshine room all ready and waiting for you, and I am going\nto take you to it very soon. As things are, I think you might allow me\nto tell you----”\n\nShe was on her feet in instant panic. “I must go,” she said. “Uncle\nHenry is dogging me to promise to remain, and I will not, and he is\nwatching me. I must go----”\n\n“Can you give me your word of honour that you will go to the neighbour\nwoman to-night; that you feel perfectly safe?”\n\nShe hesitated. “Yes, I----I think so. Yes, if he doesn't find out and\ngrow angry. Yes, I will be safe.”\n\n“How soon will you write me?”\n\n“Just as soon as I am settled and rest a little.”\n\n“Do you mean several days?”\n\n“Yes, several days.”\n\n“An eternity!” cried the Harvester with white lips. “I cannot let you\ngo. Suppose you fall ill and fail to write me, and I do not know where\nyou are, and there is no one to care for you.”\n\n“But can't you see that I don't know where I will be? If it will satisfy\nyou, I will write you a line to-morrow night and tell you where I am,\nand you can come later.”\n\n“Is that a promise?” asked the Harvester.\n\n“It is,” said the Girl.\n\n“Then I will take these things to your neighbour and wait until\nto-morrow night. You won't fail me?”\n\n“I never in all my life saw a man so wild over designs,” said the Girl,\nas she started toward the house.\n\n“Don't forget that the design I'm craziest about is the same as the red\nbird's,” the Harvester flung after her, but she hurried on and made no\nreply.\n\nHe folded the table and chair, rolled the rug, and shouldering them\npicked up the bucket and started down the river bank.\n\n“David!”\n\nSuch a faint little call he never would have been sure he heard anything\nif Belshazzar had not stopped suddenly. The hair on the back of his neck\narose and he turned with a growl in his throat. The Harvester dropped\nhis load with a crash and ran in leaping bounds, but the dog was before\nhim. Half way to the house, Ruth Jameson swayed in the grip of her\nuncle. One hand clutched his coat front in a spasmodic grasp, and with\nthe other she covered her face.\n\nThe roar the Harvester sent up stayed the big, lifted fist, and the dog\nleaped for a throat hold, and compelled the man to defend himself. The\nHarvester never knew how he covered the space until he stood between\nthem, and saw the Girl draw back and snatch together the front of her\ndress.\n\n“He took it from me!” she panted. “Make him, oh make him give back my\nmoney!”\n\nThen for a few seconds things happened too rapidly to record. Once the\nHarvester tossed a torn envelope exposing money to the Girl, and again a\nrevolver, and then both men panting and dishevelled were on their feet.\n\n“Count your money, Ruth?” said the Harvester in a voice of deadly quiet.\n\n“It is all here,” said she.\n\n“Her money?” cried Henry Jameson. “My money! She has been stealing the\nprice of my cattle from my pockets. I thought I was short several times\nlately.”\n\n“You are lying,” said the Harvester deliberately. “It is her money. I\njust paid it to her. You were trying to take it from her, not the other\nway.”\n\n“Oh, she is in your pay?” leered the man.\n\n“If you say an insulting word I think very probably I will finish you,”\n said the Harvester. “I can, with my naked hands, and all your neighbours\nwill say it is a a good job. You have felt my grip! I warn you!”\n\n“How does my niece come to be taking money from you!”\n\n“You have forfeited all right to know. Ruth, you cannot remain here. You\nmust come with me. I will take you to Onabasha and find you a room.”\n\nA horrible laugh broke from the man.\n\n“So that is the end of my saintly niece!” he said.\n\n“Remember!” cried the Harvester advancing a step. “Ruth, will you go to\nthe rest I suggested for you?”\n\n“I cannot.”\n\n“Will you go to Doctor Carey's wife?”\n\n“Impossible!”\n\n“Will you marry me and go to the shelter of my home with me?”\n\nWild-eyed she stared at him.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I love you, and want life made easier for you, above anything\nelse on earth.”\n\n“But your Dream Girl!”\n\n“YOU ARE THE DREAM GIRL! I thought the red bird told you for me! I\ndidn't know it would be a shock. I believed I had made you understand.”\n\nBy that time she was shaking with a nervous chill, and the sight\nunmanned the Harvester.\n\n“Come with me!” he urged. “We will decide what you want to do on the\nway. Only come, I beg you.”\n\n“First it was marry, now it's decide later,” broke in Henry Jameson,\ncrazed with anger. “Move a step and I'll strike you down. I'd better\nthan see you disgraced----”\n\nThe Harvester advanced and Jameson stepped back.\n\n“Ruth,” said the Harvester, “I know how impossible this seems. It is\ngiving you no chance at all. I had intended, when I found you, to court\nyou tenderly as girl ever was wooed before. Come with me, and I'll do\nit yet. The new home was built for you. The sunshine room is ready and\nwaiting for you. There is pure air, fresh water, nothing but rest and\ncomfort. I'll nurse you back to health and strength, and you shall be\ncourted until you come to me of your own accord.”\n\n“Impossible!” cried the girl.\n\n“Only if you make it so. If you will come now, we can be married in a\nfew hours, and you can be safe in your own home. I realize now that\nthis is unexpected and shocking to you, but if you will come with me and\nallow me to restore you to health and strength, and if, say, in a year,\nyou are convinced that you do not love me, I will set you free. If\nyou will come, I swear to you that you shall be my wife first, and my\nhonoured guest afterward, until such time as you either tell me you love\nme or that you never can. Will you come on those terms, Ruth?”\n\n“I cannot!”\n\n“It will end fear, uncertainty, and work, until you are strong and well.\nIt will give you home, rest, and love, that you will find is worth your\nconsideration. I will keep my word; of that you may be sure.”\n\n“No,” she cried. “No! But take back this money! Keep it until I tell you\nto whom to pay it.”\n\nShe started toward him holding out the envelope.\n\nHenry Jameson, with a dreadful oath, sprang for it, his contorted face\na drawn snarl. The Harvester caught him in air and sent him reeling. He\nsnatched the revolver from the Girl and put the money in his pocket.\n\n“Ruth, I can't leave you here,” he said. “Oh my Dream Girl! Are you\nafraid of me yet? Won't you trust me? Won't you come?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You are right about that, my lady; you will come back to the house,\nthat's what you'll do,” said Henry Jameson, starting toward her.\n\n“No!” cried the Girl retreating. “Oh Heaven help me! What am I to do?”\n\n“Ruth, you must come with me,” said the Harvester. “I don't dare leave\nyou here.”\n\nShe stood between them and gave Henry Jameson one long, searching look.\nThen she turned to the Harvester.\n\n“I am far less afraid of you. I will accept your offer,” she said.\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester. “I will keep my word and you shall have\nno regrets. Is there anything here you wish to take with you?”\n\n“I want a little trunk of my mother's. It contains some things of hers.”\n\n“Will you show me where it is?”\n\nShe started toward the house; he followed, and Henry Jameson fell in\nline. The Harvester turned on him. “You remain where you are,” he said.\n“I will take nothing but the trunk. I know what you are thinking,\nbut you will not get your gun just now. I will return this revolver\nto-morrow.”\n\n“And the first thing I do with it will be to use it on you,” said Henry\nJameson.\n\n“I'll report that threat to the police, so that they can see you\nproperly hanged if you do,” retorted the Harvester, as he followed the\ngirl.\n\n“Where is his gun?” he asked as he overtook her. When he reached the\nhouse he told her to watch the door. He went inside, broke the lock from\nthe gun in the corner, found the trunk, and swinging it to his shoulder,\npassed Henry Jameson and went back through the woods. The Harvester set\nthe trunk in the wagon, helped the Girl in, and returned for the load\nhe had dropped at her call. Then he took the lines and started for\nOnabasha.\n\nThe Girl beside him was almost fainting. He stopped to give her a drink\nand tried to encourage her.\n\n“Brace up the best you can, Ruth,” he said. “You must go with me for a\nlicense; that is the law. Afterward, I'll make it just as easy for\nyou as possible. I will do everything, and in a few hours you will be\ncomfortable in your room. You brave girl! This must come out right!\nYou have suffered more than your share. I will have peace for you the\nremainder of the way.”\n\nShe lifted shaking hands and tried to arrange her hair and dress. As\nthey neared the city she spoke.\n\n“What will they ask me?”\n\n“I don't know. But I am sure the law requires you to appear in person\nnow. I can take you somewhere and find out first.”\n\n“That will take time. I want to reach my room. What would you think?”\n\n“If you are of age, where you were born, if you are a native of this\ncountry, what your father and mother died of, how old they were, and\nsuch questions as that. I'll help you all I can. You know those things.\ndon't you?”\n\n“Yes. But I must tell you----”\n\n“I don't want to be told anything,” said the Harvester. “Save your\nstrength. All I want to know is any way in which I can make this easier\nfor you. Nothing else matters. I will tell you what I think; if you have\nany objections, make them. I will drive to the bank and get a draft for\nwhat you owe, and have that off your mind. Then we will get the license.\nAfter that I'll take you to the side door, slip you in the elevator and\nto the fitting room of a store where I know the manager, and you shall\nhave some pretty clothing while I arrange for a minister, and I'll come\nfor you with a carriage. That isn't the kind of wedding you or any other\ngirl should have, but there are times when a man only can do his best.\nYou will help me as much as you can, won't you?”\n\n“Anything you choose. It doesn't matter----only be quick as possible.”\n\n“There are a few details to which I must attend,” said the Harvester,\n“and the time will go faster trying on dresses than waiting alone. When\nyou are properly clothed you will feel better. What did you say the\namount you owe is?”\n\n“You may get a draft for fifty dollars. I will pay the remainder when I\nearn it.”\n\n“Ruth, won't you give me the pleasure of taking you home free from the\nworry of that debt?”\n\n“I am not going to 'worry.' I am going to work and pay it.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Harvester. “This is the bank. We will stop here.”\n\nThey went in and he handed her a slip of paper.\n\n“Write the name and address on that?” he said.\n\nAs the slip was returned to him, without a glance he folded it and slid\nit under a wicket. “Write a draft for fifty dollars payable to that\nparty, and send to that address, from Miss Ruth Jameson,” he said.\n\nThen he turned to her.\n\n“That is over. See how easy it is! Now we will go to the court house. It\nis very close. Try not to think. Just move and speak.”\n\n“Hello, Langston!” said the clerk. “What can we do for you here?”\n\n“Show this girl every consideration,” whispered the Harvester, as he\nadvanced. “I want a marriage license in your best time. I will answer\nfirst.”\n\nWith the document in his possession, they went to the store he\ndesignated, where he found the Girl a chair in the fitting room, while\nhe went to see the manager.\n\n“I want one of your most sensible and accommodating clerks,” said the\nHarvester, “and I would like a few words with her.”\n\nWhen she was presented he scrutinized her carefully and decided she\nwould do.\n\n“I have many thanks and something more substantial for a woman who will\nhelp me to carry through a slightly unusual project with sympathy and\nability,” he said, “and the manager has selected you. Are you willing?”\n\n“If I can,” said the clerk.\n\n“She has put up your other orders,” interposed the manager; “were they\nsatisfactory?”\n\n“I don't know,” said the Harvester. “They have not yet reached the one\nfor whom they were intended. What I want you to do,” he said to the\nclerk, “is to go to the fitting room and dress the girl you find there\nfor her wedding. She had other plans, but death disarranged them, and\nshe has only an hour in which to meet the event most girls love to\nlinger over for months. She has been ill, and is worn with watching; but\nsome time she may look back to her wedding day with joy, and if only\nyou would help me to make the best of it for her, I would be, as I said,\nunder more obligations than I can express.”\n\n“I will do anything,” said the clerk.\n\n“Very well,” said the Harvester. “She has come from the country entirely\nunprepared. She is delicate and refined. Save her all the embarrassment\nyou can. Dress her beautifully in white. Keep a memorandum slip of what\nyou spend for my account.”\n\n“What is the limit?” asked the clerk.\n\n“There is none,” said the Harvester. “Put the prettiest things on her\nyou have in the right sizes, and if you are a woman with a heart, be\ngentle!”\n\n“Is she ready?” inquired the manager at the door an hour later.\n\n“I am,” said the Girl stepping through.\n\nThe astounded Harvester stood and stared, utterly oblivious of the\ncurious people.\n\n“Here, here, here!” suddenly he whistled it, in the red bird's most\nentreating tones.\n\nThe Girl laughed and the colour in her face deepened.\n\n“Let us go,” she said.\n\n“But what about you?” asked the manager of the Harvester.\n\n“Thunder!” cried the man aghast. “I was so busy getting everything else\nready, I forgot all about myself. I can't stand before a minister beside\nher, can I?”\n\n“Well I should say not,” said the manager.\n\n“Indeed yes,” said the Girl. “I never saw you in any other clothing. You\nwould be a stranger of whom I'd be afraid.”\n\n“That settles it!” said the Harvester calmly. “Thank all of you more\nthan words can express. I will come in the first of the week and tell\nyou how we get along.”\n\nThen they went to the carriage and started for the residence of a\nminister.\n\n“Ruth, you are my Dream Girl to the tips of your eyelashes,” said the\nHarvester. “I almost wish you were not. It wouldn't keep me thinking so\nmuch of the remainder of that dream. You are the loveliest sight I ever\nsaw.”\n\n“Do I really appear well?” asked the Girl, hungry for appreciation.\n\n“Indeed you do!” said the Harvester. “I never could have guessed that\nsuch a miracle could be wrought. And you don't seem so tired. Were they\ngood to you?”\n\n“Wonderfully! I did not know there was kindness like that in all the\nworld for a stranger. I did not feel lost or embarrassed, except the\nfirst few seconds when I didn't know what to do. Oh I thank you for\nthis! You were right. Whatever comes in life I always shall love to\nremember that I was daintily dressed and appeared as well as I could\nwhen I was married. But I must tell you I am not real. They did\neverything on earth to me, three of them working at a time. I feel an\nincrease in self-respect in some way. David, I do appear better?”\n\nWhen she said “David,” the Harvester looked out of the window and gulped\ndown his delight. He leaned toward her.\n\n“Shut your eyes and imagine you see the red bird,” he said. “In my\nsoul, I am saying to you again and again just what he sang. You are\nwonderfully beautiful, Ruth, and more than wonderfully sweet. Will you\nanswer me a question?”\n\n“If I can.”\n\n“I love you with all my heart. Will you marry me?”\n\n“I said I would.”\n\n“Then we are engaged, aren't we?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Please remove the glove from your left hand. I want to put on your\nring. This will have to be a very short engagement, but no one save\nourselves need know.”\n\n“David, that isn't necessary.”\n\n“I have it here, and believe me, Ruth, it will help in a few minutes;\nand all your life you will be glad. It is a precious symbol that has a\nmeaning. This wedding won't be hurt by putting all the sacredness into\nit we can. Please, Ruth!”\n\n“On one condition.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“That you will accept and wear my mother's wedding ring in exchange,”\n she said. “It is all I have.”\n\n“Ruth, do you really wish that?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“I am more pleased than I can tell you. May I have it now?”\n\nShe took off her glove and the Harvester held her hand closely a second,\nthen lifted it to his lips, passionately kissed it and slipped on a\nring, the setting a big, lustrous pearl.\n\n“I looked at some others,” he said, “but nothing got a second glance\nsave this. They knew you were coming down the ages, and so they got the\npearls ready. How beautiful it is on your hand! Put on the glove and\nwear that ring as if you had owned it for the long, happy year of\nbetrothal every girl should have. You can start yours to-day, and if by\nthis time next year I have not won you to my heart and arms, I'm no\nman and not worthy of you. Ruth, you will try just a little to love me,\nwon't you?”\n\n“I will try with all my heart,” she said instantly.\n\n“Thank you! I am perfectly happy with that. I never expected to marry\nyou before a year, anyway. All the difference will be the blessed fact\nthat instead of coming to see you somewhere else, I now can have you in\nmy care, and court you every minute. You might as well make up your mind\nto capitulate soon. It's on the books that you do.”\n\n“If an instant ever comes when I realize that I love you, I will come\nstraight and tell you; believe me, I will.”\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester. “This is going to be quite a proper\nwedding after all. Here is the place. It will be over soon and you on\nthe home way. Lord, Ruth----!”\n\nThe Girl smiled at him as he opened the carriage door, helped her up the\nsteps and rang the bell.\n\n“Be brave now!” he whispered. “Don't lose your lovely colour. These\npeople will be as kind as they were at the store.”\n\nThe minister was gentle and wasted no time. His wife and daughter, who\nappeared for witnesses, kissed Ruth, and congratulated her. She and the\nHarvester stood, took the vows, exchanged rings, and returned to the\ncarriage, a man and his wife by the laws of man.\n\n“Drive to Seaton's cafe',” the Harvester said.\n\n“Oh David, let us go home!”\n\n“This is so good I hate to stop it for something you may not like so\nwell. I ordered lunch and if we don't eat it I will have to pay for it\nanyway. You wouldn't want me to be extravagant, would you?”\n\n“No,” said the Girl, “and besides, since you mention it, I believe I am\nhungry.”\n\n“Good!” cried the Harvester. “I hoped so! Ruth, you wouldn't allow me\nto hold your hand just until we reach the cafe'? It might save me from\nbursting with joy.”\n\n“Yes,” she said. “But I must take off my lovely gloves first. I want to\nkeep them forever.”\n\n“I'd hate the glove being removed dreadfully,” said the Harvester, his\neyes dancing and snapping.\n\n“I'm sorry I am so thin and shaky,” said the Girl. “I will be steady and\nplump soon, won't I?”\n\n“On your life you will,” said the Harvester, taking the hand gently.\n\nNow there are a number of things a man deeply in love can think of to do\nwith a woman's white hand. He can stroke it, press it tenderly, and lay\nit against his lips and his heart. The Harvester lacked experience\nin these arts, and yet by some wonderful instinct all of these things\noccurred to him. There was real colour in the Girl's cheeks by the time\nhe helped her into the cafe'. They were guided to a small room, cool and\nrestful, close a window, beside which grew a tree covered with talking\nleaves. A waiting attendant, who seemed perfectly adept, brought in\nsteaming bouillon, fragrant tea, broiled chicken, properly cooked\nvegetables, a wonderful salad, and then delicious ices and cold fruit.\nThe happy Harvester leaned back and watched the Girl daintily manage\nalmost as much food as he wanted to see her eat.\n\nWhen they had finished, “Now we are going home,” he said. “Will you try\nto like it, Ruth?”\n\n“Indeed I will,” she promised. “As soon as I grow accustomed to the\ndreadful stillness, and learn what things will not bite me, I'll be\nbetter.”\n\n“I'll have to ask you to wait a minute,” he said. “One thing I forgot. I\nmust hire a man to take Betsy home.”\n\n“Aren't you going to drive her yourself?”\n\n“No ma'am! We are going in a carriage or a motor,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Indeed we are not!” contradicted the Girl. “You have had this all your\nway so far. I am going home behind Betsy, with Belshazzar at my knee.”\n\n“But your dress! People will think I am crazy to put a lovely woman like\nyou in a spring wagon.”\n\n“Let them!” said the Girl placidly. “Why should we bother about other\npeople? I am going with Betsy and Belshazzar.”\n\nThe Harvester had been thinking that he adored her, that it was\nimpossible to love her more, but every minute was proving to him that he\nwas capable of feeling so profound it startled him. To carry the Girl,\nhis bride, through the valley and up the hill in the little spring wagon\ndrawn by Betsy--that would have been his ideal way. But he had supposed\nthat she would be afraid of soiling her dress, and embarrassed to ride\nin such a conveyance. Instead it was her choice. Yes, he could love her\nmore. Hourly she was proving that.\n\n“Come this way a few steps,” he said. “Betsy is here.”\n\nThe Girl laid her face against the nose of the faithful old animal, and\nstroked her head and neck. Then she held her skirts and the Harvester\nhelped her into the wagon. She took the seat, and the dog went wild with\njoy.\n\n“Come on, Bel,” she softly commanded.\n\nThe dog hesitated, and looked at the Harvester for permission.\n\n“You may come here and put your head on my knee,” said the Girl.\n\n“Belshazzar, you lucky dog, you are privileged to sit there and lay your\nhead on the lady's lap,” said the Harvester, and the dog quivered with\njoy.\n\nThen the man picked up the lines, gave a backward glance to the bed\nof the wagon, high piled with large bundles, and turned Betsy toward\nMedicine Woods. Through the crowded streets and toward the country they\ndrove, when a big red car passed, a man called to them, then reversed\nand slowly began backing beside the wagon. The Harvester stopped.\n\n“That is my best friend, Doctor Carey, of the hospital, Ruth,” he said\nhastily. “May I tell him, and will you shake hands with him?”\n\n“Certainly!” said the Girl.\n\n“Is it really you, David?” the doctor peered with gleaming eyes from\nunder the car top.\n\n“Really!” cried the Harvester, as man greets man with a full heart when\nhe is sure of sympathy. “Come, give us your best send-off, Doc! We were\nmarried an hour ago. We are headed for Medicine Woods. Doctor Carey,\nthis is Mrs. Langston.”\n\n“Mighty glad to know you!” cried the doctor, reaching a happy hand.\n\nThe Girl met it cordially, while she smiled on him.\n\n“How did this happen?” demanded the doctor. “Why didn't you let us know?\nThis is hardly fair of you, David. You might have let me and the Missus\nshare with you.”\n\n“That is to be explained,” said the Harvester. “It was decided on very\nsuddenly, and rather sadly, on account of the death of Mrs. Jameson. I\nforced Ruth to marry me and come with me. I grow rather frightened when\nI think of it, but it was the only way I knew. She absolutely refused my\nother plans. You see before you a wild man carrying away a woman to his\ncave.”\n\n“Don't believe him, Doctor!” laughed the Girl. “If you know him, you\nwill understand that to offer all he had was like him, when he saw my\nnecessity. You will come to see us soon?”\n\n“I'll come right now,” said the doctor. “I'll bring my wife and arrive\nby the time you do.”\n\n“Oh no you won't!” said the Harvester. “Do you observe the bed of\nthis wagon? This happened all 'unbeknownst' to us. We have to set up\nhousekeeping after we reach home. We will notify you when we are ready\nfor visitors. Just you subside and wait until you are sent for.”\n\n“Why David!” cried the astonished Girl.\n\n“That's the law!” said the Harvester tersely. “Good-bye, Doc; we'll be\nready for you in a day or two.”\n\nHe leaned down and held out his hand. The grip that caught it said all\nany words could convey; and then Betsy started up the hill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. WHEN THE DREAM CAME TRUE\n\nAt first the road lay between fertile farms dotted with shocked wheat,\ncovered with undulant seas of ripening oats, and forests of growing\ncorn. The larks were trailing melody above the shorn and growing fields,\nthe quail were ingathering beside the fences, and from the forests on\ngraceful wings slipped the nighthawks and sailed and soared, dropping\nso low that the half moons formed by white spots on their spread wings\nshowed plainly.\n\n“Why is this country so different from the other side of the city?”\n asked the Girl.\n\n“It is older,” replied the Harvester, “and it lies higher. This was\nsettled and well cultivated when that was a swamp. But as a farming\nproposition, the money is in the lowland like your uncle's. The crops\nraised there are enormous compared with the yield of these fields.”\n\n“I see,” said she. “But this is much better to look at and the air is\ndifferent. It lacks a soggy, depressing quality.”\n\n“I don't allow any air to surpass that of Medicine Woods,” said the\nHarvester, “by especial arrangement with the powers that be.”\n\nThen they dipped into a little depression and arose to cross the\nrailroad and then followed a longer valley that was ragged and unkempt\ncompared with the road between cultivated fields. The Harvester was busy\ntrying to plan what to do first, and how to do it most effectively, and\nworking his brain to think if he had everything the Girl would require\nfor her comfort; so he drove silently through the deepening shadows. She\nshuddered and awoke him suddenly. He glanced at her from the corner of\nhis eye.\n\nHer thoughts had gone on a journey, also, and the way had been rough,\nfor her face wore a strained appearance. The hands lying bare in her lap\nwere tightly gripped, so that the nails and knuckles appeared blue.\nThe Harvester hastily cast around seeking for the cause of the\ntransformation. A few minutes ago she had seemed at ease and\ncomfortable, now she was close open panic. Nothing had been said that\nwould disturb her. With brain alert he searched for the reason. Then\nit began to come to him. The unaccustomed silence and depression of the\ncountry might have been the beginning. Coming from the city and crowds\nof people to the gloomy valley with a man almost a stranger, going she\nknew not where, to conditions she knew not what, with the experiences of\nthe day vivid before her. The black valley road was not prepossessing,\nwith its border of green pools, through which grew swamp bushes and\nstraggling vines. The Harvester looked carefully at the road, and ceased\nto marvel at the Girl. But he disliked to let her know he understood, so\nhe gave one last glance at those gripped hands and casually held out the\nlines.\n\n“Will you take these just a second?” he asked. “Don't let them touch\nyour dress. We must not lose of our load, because it's mostly things\nthat will make you more comfortable.”\n\nHe arose, and turning, pretended to see that everything was all right.\nThen he resumed his seat and drove on.\n\n“I am a little ashamed of this stretch through here,” he said\napologetically. “I could have managed to have it cleared and in better\nshape long ago, but in a way it yields a snug profit, and so far I've\npreferred the money. The land is not mine, but I could grub out this\ngrowth entirely, instead of taking only what I need.”\n\n“Is there stuff here you use?” the Girl aroused herself to ask, and the\nHarvester saw the look of relief that crossed her face at the sound of\nhis voice.\n\n“Well I should say yes,” he laughed. “Those bushes, numerous everywhere,\nwith the hanging yellow-green balls, those, in bark and root, go into\nfever medicines. They are not so much used now, but sometimes I have a\ncall, and when I do, I pass the beds on my----on our land, and come down\nhere and get what is needed. That bush,” he indicated with the whip,\n“blooms exquisitely in the spring. It is a relative of flowering\ndogwood, and the one of its many names I like best is silky cornel.\nIsn't that pretty?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “it is beautiful.”\n\n“I've planted some for you in a hedge along the driveway so next spring\nyou can gather all you want. I think you'll like the odour. The bark\nbrings more than true dogwood. If I get a call from some house that uses\nit, I save mine and come down here. Around the edge are hop trees, and\nI realize something from them, and also the false and true bitter-sweet\nthat run riot here. Both of them have pretty leaves, while the berries\nof the true hang all winter and the colour is gorgeous. I've set your\nhedge closely with them. When it has grown a few months it's going to\nfurnish flowers in the spring, a million different, wonderful leaves\nand berries in the summer, many fruits the birds love in the fall, and\nbright berries, queer seed pods, and nuts all winter.”\n\n“You planted it for me?”\n\n“Yes. I think it will be beautiful in a season or two; it isn't so bad\nnow. I hope it will call myriads of birds to keep you company. When\nyou cross this stretch of road hereafter, don't see fetid water and\nstraggling bushes and vines; just say to yourself, this helps to fill\norders!”\n\n“I am perfectly tolerant of it now,” she said. “You make everything\ndifferent. I will come with you and help collect the roots and barks\nyou want. Which bush did you say relieved the poor souls scorching with\nfever?”\n\nThe Harvester drew on the lines, Betsy swerved to the edge of the road,\nand he leaned and broke a branch.\n\n“This one,” he answered. “Buttonbush, because those balls resemble round\nbuttons. Aren't they peculiar? See how waxy and gracefully cut and set\nthe leaves are. Go on, Betsy, get us home before night. We appear our\nbest early in the morning, when the sun tops Medicine Woods and begins\nto light us up, and in the evening, just when she drops behind Onabasha\nback there, and strikes us with a few level rays. Will you take the\nlines until I open this gate?”\n\nShe laid the twig in her lap on the white gloves and took the lines.\nAs the gate swung wide, Betsy walked through and stopped at the usual\nplace.\n\n“Now my girl,” said the Harvester, “cross yourself, lean back, and take\nyour ease. This side that gate you are at home. From here on belongs to\nus.”\n\n“To you, you mean,” said the Girl.\n\n“To us, I mean,” declared the Harvester. “Don't you know that the\n'worldly goods bestowal' clause in a marriage ceremony is a partial\nreality. It doesn't give you 'all my worldly goods,' but it gives you\none third. Which will you take, the hill, lake, marsh, or a part of all\nof them.”\n\n“Oh, is there water?”\n\n“Did I forget to mention that I was formerly sole owner and proprietor\nof the lake of Lost Loons, also a brook of Singing Water, and many cold\nsprings. The lake covers about one third of our land, and my neighbours\nwould allow me ditch outlet to the river, but they say I'm too lazy to\ntake it.”\n\n“Lazy! Do they mean drain your lake into the river?”\n\n“They do,” said the Harvester, “and make the bed into a cornfield.”\n\n“But you wouldn't?”\n\nShe turned to him with confidence.\n\n“I haven't so far, but of course, when you see it, if you would prefer\nit in a corn----Let's play a game! Turn your head in this direction,”\n he indicated with the whip, “close your eyes, and open them when I say\nready.”\n\n“All right!”\n\n“Now!” said the Harvester.\n\n“Oh,” cried the Girl. “Stop! Please stop!”\n\nThey were at the foot of a small levee that ran to the bridge crossing\nSinging Water. On the left lay the valley through which the stream swept\nfrom its hurried rush down the hill, a marshy thicket of vines, shrubs,\nand bushes, the banks impassable with water growth. Everywhere flamed\nfoxfire and cardinal flower, thousands of wild tiger lilies lifted\ngorgeous orange-red trumpets, beside pearl-white turtle head and moon\ndaisies, while all the creek bank was a coral line with the first\nopening bloom of big pink mallows. Rank jewel flower poured gold from\ndainty cornucopias and lavender beard-tongue offered honey to a million\nbumbling bees; water smart-weed spread a glowing pink background, and\ntwining amber dodder topped the marsh in lacy mist with its delicate\nwhite bloom. Straight before them a white-sanded road climbed to the\nbridge and up a gentle hill between the young hedge of small trees and\nbushes, where again flowers and bright colours rioted and led to the\ncabin yet invisible. On the right, the hill, crowned with gigantic\nforest trees, sloped to the lake; midway the building stood, and from\nit, among scattering trees all the way to the water's edge, were immense\nbeds of vivid colour. Like a scarf of gold flung across the face of\nearth waved the misty saffron, and beside the road running down the\nhill, in a sunny, open space arose tree-like specimens of thrifty\nmagenta pokeberry. Down the hill crept the masses of colour, changing\nfrom dry soil to water growth.\n\nHigh around the blue-green surface of the lake waved lacy heads of wild\nrice, lower cat-tails, bulrushes, and marsh grasses; arrowhead lilies\nlifted spines of pearly bloom, while yellow water lilies and blue water\nhyacinths intermingled; here and there grew a pink stretch of water\nsmartweed and the dangling gold of jewel flower. Over the water,\nbordering the edge, starry faces of white pond lilies floated. Blue\nflags waved graceful leaves, willows grew in clumps, and vines clambered\neverywhere.\n\nAmong the growth of the lake shore, duck, coot, and grebe voices\ncommingled in the last chattering hastened splash of securing supper\nbefore bedtime; crying killdeers crossed the water, and overhead the\nnighthawks massed in circling companies. Betsy climbed the hill and at\nevery step the Girl cried, “Slower! please go slower!” With wide eyes\nshe stared around her.\n\n“WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS?” she demanded in awed\ntones.\n\n“Have I had opportunity to describe much of anything?” asked the\nHarvester. “Besides, I was born and reared here, and while it has been\na garden of bloom for the past six years only, it always has been a\npicture; but one forgets to say much about a sight seen every day and\nthat requires the work this does.”\n\n“That white mist down there, what is it?” she marvelled.\n\n“Pearls grown by the Almighty,” answered the Harvester. “Flowers that I\nhope you will love. They are like you. Tall and slender, graceful, pearl\nwhite and pearl pure----those are the arrowhead Lilies.”\n\n“And the wonderful purplish-red there on the bank? Oh, I could kneel and\npray before colour like that!'\n\n“Pokeberry!” said the Harvester. “Roots bring five cents a pound. Good\nblood purifier.”\n\n“Man!” cried the Girl. “How can you? I'm not going to ask what another\ncolour is. I'll just worship what I like in silence.”\n\n“Will you forgive me if I tell you what a woman whose judgment I respect\nsays about that colour?”\n\n“Perhaps!”\n\n“She says, 'God proves that He loves it best of all the tints in His\nworkshop by using it first and most sparingly.' Now are you going to\npunish me by keeping silent?”\n\n“I couldn't if I tried.” Just then they came upon the bridge crossing\nSinging Water, and there was a long view of its border, rippling bed,\nand marshy banks; while on the other hand the lake resembled a richly\nincrusted sapphire.\n\n“Is the house close?”\n\n“Just a few rods, at the turn of the drive.”\n\n“Please help me down. I want to remain here a while. I don't care what\nelse there is to see. Nothing can equal this. I wish I could bring down\na bed and sleep here. I'd like to have a table, and draw and paint. I\nunderstand now what you mean about the designs you mentioned. Why, there\nmust be thousands! I can't go on. I never saw anything so appealing in\nall my life.”\n\nNow the Harvester's mother had designed that bridge and he had built\nit with much care. From bark-covered railings to solid oak floor and\ncomfortable benches running along the sides it was intended to be a part\nof the landscape.\n\n“I'll send Belshazzar to the cabin with the wagon,” he said, “so you can\nsee better.”\n\n“But you must not!” she cried. “I can't walk. I wouldn't soil these\nbeautiful shoes for anything.”\n\n“Why don't you change them?” inquired the Harvester.\n\n“I am afraid I forgot everything I had,” said the Girl.\n\n“There are shoes somewhere in this load. I thought of them in getting\nother things for you, but I had no idea as to size, and so I told that\nclerk to-day when she got your measure to put in every kind you'd need.”\n\n“You are horribly extravagant,” she said. “But if you have them here,\nperhaps I could use one pair.”\n\nThe Harvester mounted the wagon and hunted until he found a large box,\nand opening it on the bench he disclosed almost every variety of shoe,\nwalking shoe and slipper, a girl ever owned, as well as sandals and high\novershoes.\n\n“For pity sake!” cried the Girl. “Cover that box! You frighten me.\nYou'll never get them paid for. You must take them straight back.”\n\n“Never take anything back,” said the Harvester. “'Be sure you are right,\nthen go ahead,' is my motto. Now I know these are your correct size\nand that for differing occasions you will want just such shoes as other\ngirls have, and here they are. Simple as life! I think these will serve\nbecause they are for street wear, yet they are white inside.”\n\nHe produced a pair of canvas walking shoes and kneeling before her held\nout his hand.\n\nWhen he had finished, he loaded the box on the wagon, gave the hitching\nstrap to Belshazzar, and told him to lead Betsy to the cabin and hold\nher until he came. Then he turned to the Girl.\n\n“Now,” he said, “look as long as you choose. But remember that the law\ngives you part of this and your lover, which same am I, gives you the\nremainder, so you are privileged to come here at any hour as often as\nyou please. If you miss anything this evening, you have all time to come\nin which to re-examine it.”\n\n“I'd like to live right here on this bridge,” she said. “I wish it had a\nroof.”\n\n“Roof it to-morrow,” offered the Harvester. “Simple matter of a few\npillars already cut, joists joined, and some slab shingles left from the\ncabin. Anything else your ladyship can suggest?”\n\n“That you be sensible.”\n\n“I was born that way,” explained the Harvester, “and I've cultivated the\nfaculty until I've developed real genius. Talking of sense, there never\nwas a proper marriage in which the man didn't give the woman a present.\nYou seem likely to be more appreciative of this bridge than anything\nelse I have, so right here and now would be the appropriate place to\noffer you my wedding gift. I didn't have much time, but I couldn't have\nfound anything more suitable if I'd taken a year.”\n\nHe held out a small, white velvet case.\n\n“Doesn't that look as if it were made for a bride?” he asked.\n\n“It does,” answered the Girl. “But I can't take it. You are not doing\nright. Marrying as we did, you never can believe that I love you; maybe\nit won't ever happen that I do. I have no right to accept gifts and\nexpensive clothing from you. In the first place, if the love you ask\nnever comes, there is no possible way in which I can repay you. In the\nsecond, these things you are offering are not suitable for life and work\nin the woods. In the third, I think you are being extravagant, and I\ncouldn't forgive myself if I allowed that.”\n\n“You divide your statements like a preacher, don't you?” asked the\nHarvester ingenuously. “Now sit thee here and gaze on the placid lake\nand quiet your troubled spirit, while I demolish your 'perfectly good'\narguments. In the first place, you are now my wife, and you have a\nright to take anything I offer, if you care for it or can use it in any\nmanner. In the second, you must recognize a difference in our positions.\nWhat seems nothing to you means all the world to me, and you are less\nthan human if you deprive me of the joy of expressing feelings I am in\nhonour bound to keep in my heart, by these little material offerings. In\nthe third place, I inherited over six hundred acres of land and water,\nplease observe the water----it is now in evidence on your left. All my\nlife I have been taught to be frugal, economical, and to work. All I've\nearned either has gone back into land, into the bank, or into books,\nvery plain food, and such clothing as you now see me wearing. Just the\nvalue of this place as it stands, with its big trees, its drug crops\nyielding all the year round, would be difficult to estimate; and I don't\nmind telling you that on the top of that hill there is a gold mine, and\nit's mine----ours since four o'clock.”\n\n“A gold mine!”\n\n“Acres and acres of wild ginseng, seven years of age and ready to\nharvest. Do you remember what your few pounds brought?”\n\n“Why it's worth thousands!”\n\n“Exactly! For your peace of mind I might add that all I have done or got\nis paid for, except what I bought to-day, and I will write a check for\nthat as soon as the bill is made out. My bank account never will feel it\nTruly, Ruth, I am not doing or going to do anything extravagant. I can't\nafford to give you diamond necklaces, yachts, and trips to Europe; but\nyou can have the contents of this box and a motor boat on the lake, a\nhorse and carriage, and a trip----say to New York perfectly well. Please\ntake it.”\n\n“I wish you wouldn't ask me. I would be happier not to.”\n\n“Yes, but I do ask you,” persisted the Harvester. “You are not the\nonly one to be considered. I have some rights also, and I'm not so\nself-effacing that I won't insist upon them. From your standpoint I\nam almost a stranger. You have spent no time considering me in near\nrelations; I realize that. You feel as if you were driven here for\na refuge, and that is true. I said to Belshazzar one day that I must\nremember that you had no dream, and had spent no time loving me, and\nI do I know how this wedding seems to you, but it's going to mean\nsomething different and better soon, please God. I can see your side;\nnow suppose you take a look at mine. I did have a dream, it was my\ndream, and beyond the sum of any delight I ever conceived. On the\nstrength of it I rebuilt my home and remodelled these premises. Then\nI saw you, and from that day I worked early and late. I lost you and I\nnever stopped until I found you; and I would have courted and won you,\nbut the fates intervened and here you are! So it's my delight to court\nand win you now. If you knew the difference between having a dream that\nstirred the least fibre of your being and facing the world in a demand\nfor realization of it, and then finding what you coveted in the palm\nof your hand, as it were, you would know what is in my heart, and\nwhy expression of some kind is necessary to me just now, and why I'll\nexplode if it is denied. It will lower the tension, if you will accept\nthis as a matter of fact; as if you rather expected and liked it, if you\ncan.”\n\nThe Harvester set his finger on the spring.\n\n“Don't!” she said. “I'll never have the courage if you do. Give it to me\nin the case, and let me open it. Despite your unanswerable arguments, I\nam quite sure that is the only way in which I can take it.”\n\nThe Harvester gave her the box.\n\n“My wedding gift!” she exclaimed, more to herself than to him. “Why\nshould I be the buffet of all the unkind fates kept in store for a girl\nmy whole life, and then suddenly be offered home, beautiful gifts, and\nwonderful loving kindness by a stranger?”\n\nThe Harvester ran his fingers through his crisp hair, pulled it into\na peak, stepped to the seat and sitting on the railing, he lifted his\nelbows, tilted his head, and began a motley outpouring of half-spoken,\nhalf-whistled trills and imploring cries. There was enough similarity\nthat the Girl instantly recognized the red bird. Out of breath the\nHarvester dropped to the seat beside her.\n\n“And don't you keep forgetting it!” he cried. “Now open that box and\nput on the trinket; because I want to take you to the cabin when the sun\nfalls level on the drive.”\n\nShe opened the case, exposing a thread of gold that appeared too slender\nfor the weight of an exquisite pendant, set with shimmering pearls.\n\n“If you will look down there,” the Harvester pointed over the railing to\nthe arrowhead lilies touched with the fading light, “you will see that\nthey are similar.”\n\n“They are!” cried the Girl. “How lovely! Which is more beautiful I do\nnot know. And you won't like it if I say I must not.”\n\nShe held the open case toward the Harvester.\n\n“'Possession is nine points in the law,'” he quoted. “You have taken\nit already and it is in your hands; now make the gift perfect for me by\nputting it on and saying nothing more.”\n\n“My wedding gift!” repeated the Girl. Slowly she lifted the beautiful\nornament and held it in the light. “I'm so glad you just force me to\ntake it,” she said. “Any half-normal girl would be delighted. I do\naccept it. And what's more, I am going to keep and wear it and my ring\nat suitable times all my life, in memory of what you have done to be\nkind to me on this awful day.”\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester. “That is a flash of the proper spirit.\nAllow me to put it on you.”\n\n“No!” said the Girl. “Not yet! After a while! I want to hold it in my\nhands, where I can see it!”\n\n“Now there is one other thing,” said the Harvester.\n\n“If I had known for any length of time that this day was coming and\nbringing you, as most men know when a girl is to be given into their\ncare, I could have made it different. As it is, I've done the best I\nknew. All your after life I hope you will believe this: Just that if you\nmissed anything to-day that would have made it easier for you or more\npleasant, the reason was because of my ignorance of women and the\nconventions, and lack of time. I want you to know and to feel that in my\nheart those vows I took were real. This is undoubtedly all the marrying\nI will ever want to do. I am old-fashioned in my ways, and deeply imbued\nwith the spirit of the woods, and that means unending evolution along\nthe same lines.\n\n“To me you are my revered and beloved wife, my mate now; and I am sure\nnothing will make me feel any different. This is the day of my marriage\nto the only woman I ever have thought of wedding, and to me it is joy\nunspeakable. With other men such a day ends differently from the close\nof this with me. Because I have done and will continue to do the level\nbest I know for you, this oration is the prologue to asking you for\none gift to me from you, a wedding gift. I don't want it unless you can\nbestow it ungrudgingly, and truly want me to have it. If you can, I will\nhave all from this day I hope for at the hands of fate. May I have the\ngift I ask of you, Ruth?”\n\nShe lifted startled eyes to his face.\n\n“Tell me what it is?” she breathed.\n\n“It may seem much to you,” said the Harvester; “to me it appears only\na gracious act, from a wonderful woman, if you will give me freely, one\nreal kiss. I've never had one, save from a Dream Girl, Ruth, and you\nwill have to make yours pretty good if it is anything like hers. You are\nwoman enough to know that most men crush their brides in their arms and\ntake a thousand. I'll put my hands behind me and never move a muscle,\nand I won't ask for more, if you will crown my wedding day with only one\ntouch of your lips. Will you kiss me just once, Ruth?”\n\nThe Girl lifted a piteous face down which big tears suddenly rolled.\n\n“Oh Man, you shame me!” she cried. “What kind of a heart have I that it\nfails to respond to such a plea? Have I been overworked and starved so\nlong there is no feeling in me? I don't understand why I don't take you\nin my arms and kiss you a hundred times, but you see I don't. It doesn't\nseem as if I ever could.”\n\n“Never mind,” said the Harvester gently. “It was only a fancy of mine,\nbred from my dream and unreasonable, perhaps. I am sorry I mentioned it.\nThe sun is on the stoop now; I want you to enter your home in its light.\nCome!”\n\nHe half lifted her from the bench. “I am going to help you up the\ndrive as I used to assist mother,” he said, fighting to keep his voice\nnatural. “Clasp your hands before you and draw your elbows to your\nsides. Now let me take one in each palm, and you will scoot up this\ndrive as if you were on wheels.”\n\n“But I don't want to 'scoot',” she said unsteadily. “I must go slowly\nand not miss anything.”\n\n“On the contrary, you don't want to do any such thing----you should\nleave most of it for to-morrow.”\n\n“I had forgotten there would be any to-morrow. It seems as if the day\nwould end it and set me adrift again.”\n\n“You are going to awake in the gold room with the sun shining on your\nface in the morning, and it's going to keep on all your life. Now if\nyou've got a smile in your anatomy, bring it to the surface, for just\nbeyond this tree lies happiness for you.”\n\nHis voice was clear and steady now, his confidence something contagious.\nThere was a lovely smile on her face as she looked at him, and stepped\ninto the line of light crossing the driveway; and then she stopped\nand cried, “Oh lovely! Lovely! Lovely!” over and over. Then maybe the\nHarvester was not glad he had planned, worked unceasingly, and builded\nas well as he knew.\n\nThe cabin of large, peeled, golden oak logs, oiled to preserve them,\nnestled like a big mushroom on the side of the hill. Above and behind\nthe building the trees arose in a green setting. The roof was stained\nto their shades. The wide veranda was enclosed in screening, over which\nwonderful vines climbed in places, and round it grew ferns and deep-wood\nplants. Inside hung big baskets of wild growth; there was a wide\nswinging seat, with a back rest, supported by heavy chains. There were\nchairs and a table of bent saplings and hickory withes. Two full\nstories the building arose, and the western sun warmed it almost to\norange-yellow, while the graceful vines crept toward the roof.\n\nThe Girl looked at the rapidly rising hedge on each side of her, at the\nwhite floor of the drive, and long and long at the cabin.\n\n“You did all this since February?” she asked.\n\n“Even to transforming the landscape,” answered the Harvester.\n\n“Oh I wish it was not coming night!” she cried. “I don't want the dark\nto come, until you have told me the name of every tree and shrub of that\nwonderful hedge, and every plant and vine of the veranda; and oh I want\nto follow up the driveway and see that beautiful little creek--listen\nto it chuckle and laugh! Is it always glad like that? See the ferns\nand things that grow on the other side of it! Why there are big beds of\nthem. And lilies of the valley by the acre! What is that yellow around\nthe corner?”\n\n“Never mind that now,” said the Harvester, guiding her up the steps,\nalong the gravelled walk to the screen that he opened, and over a flood\nof gold light she crossed the veranda, and entered the door.\n\n“Now here it appears bare,” said the Harvester, “because I didn't know\nwhat should go on the walls or what rugs to get or about the windows.\nThe table, chairs, and couch I made myself with some help from a\ncarpenter. They are solid black walnut and will age finely.”\n\n“They are beautiful,” said the Girl, softly touching the shining table\ntop with her fingers. “Please put the necklace on me now, I have to use\nmy eyes and hands for other things.”\n\nShe held out the box and the Harvester lifted the pendant and clasped\nthe chain around her neck. She glanced at the lustrous pearls and then\nthe fingers of one hand softly closed over them. She went through the\nlong, wide living-room, examining the chairs and mantel, stopping to\ntouch and exclaim over its array of half-finished candlesticks. At the\ndoor of his room she paused. “And this?” she questioned.\n\n“Mine,” said the Harvester, turning the knob. “I'll give you one peep\nto satisfy your curiosity, and show you the location of the bridge over\nwhich you came to me in my dream. All the remainder is yours. I reserve\nonly this.”\n\n“Will the 'goblins git me' if I come here?”\n\n“Not goblins, but a man alive; so heed your warning. After you have seen\nit, keep away.”\n\nThe floor was cement, three of the walls heavy screening with mosquito\nwire inside, the roof slab shingled. On the inner wall was a bookcase,\nbelow it a desk, at one side a gun cabinet, at the other a bath in a\nsmall alcove beside a closet. The room contained two chairs like those\nof the veranda, and the bed was a low oak couch covered with a thick\nmattress of hemlock twigs, topped with sweet fern, on which the sun\nshone all day. On a chair at the foot were spread some white sheets, a\nblanket, and an oilcloth. The sun beat in, the wind drifted through,\nand one lying on the couch could see down the bright hill, and sweep the\nlake to the opposite bank without lifting the head. The Harvester drew\nthe Girl to the bedside.\n\n“Now straight in a line from here,” he said, “across the lake to that\nbig, scraggy oak, every clear night the moon builds a bridge of molten\ngold, and once you walked it, my girl, and came straight to me, alone\nand unafraid; and you were gracious and lovely beyond anything a man\never dreamed of before. I'll have that to think of to-night. Now come\nsee the dining-room, kitchen, and hand-made sunshine.”\n\nHe led her into what had been the front room of the old cabin, now\na large, long dining-room having on each side wide windows with deep\nseats. The fireplace backwall was against that of the living-room, but\nhere the mantel was bare. All the wood-work, chairs, the dining table,\ncupboards, and carving table were golden oak. Only a few rugs and\nfurnishings and a woman's touch were required to make it an unusual and\nbeautiful room. The kitchen was shining with a white hard-wood floor,\nwhite wood-work, and pale green walls. It was a light, airy, sanitary\nplace, supplied with a pump, sink, hot and cold water faucets,\nrefrigerator, and every modern convenience possible to the country.\n\nThen the Harvester almost carried the Girl up the stairs and showed her\nthree large sleeping rooms, empty and bare save for some packing cases.\n\n“I didn't know about these, so I didn't do anything. When you find\ntime to plan, tell me what you want, and I'll make--or buy it. They\nare good-sized, cool rooms. They all have closets and pipes from the\nfurnace, so they will be comfortable in winter. Now there is your place\nremaining. I'll leave you while I stable Betsy and feed the stock.”\n\nHe guided her to the door opening from the living-room to the east.\n\n“This is the sunshine spot,” he said. “It is bathed in morning light,\nand sheltered by afternoon shade. Singing Water is across the drive\nthere to talk to you always. It comes pelting down so fast it never\nfreezes, so it makes music all winter, and the birds are so numerous\nyou'll have to go to bed early for they'll wake you by dawn. I noticed\nthis room was going to be full of sunshine when I built it, and I craved\nonly brightness for you, so I coaxed all of it to stay that I could.\nEvery stroke is the work of my hands, and all of the furniture. I hope\nyou will like it. This is the room of which I've been telling you, Ruth.\nGo in and take possession, and I'll entreat God and all His ministering\nangels to send you sunshine and joy.”\n\nHe opened the door, guided her inside, closed it, and went swiftly to\nhis work.\n\nThe Girl stood and looked around her with amazed eyes. The floor was\npale yellow wood, polished until it shone like a table top. The casings,\ntable, chairs, dressing table, chest of drawers, and bed were solid\ncurly maple. The doors were big polished slabs of it, each containing\nenough material to veneer all the furniture in the room. The walls\nwere of plaster, tinted yellow, and the windows with yellow shades were\ncurtained in dainty white. She could hear the Harvester carrying the\nload from the wagon to the front porch, the clamour of the barn yard;\nand as she went to the north window to see the view, a shining peacock\nstrutted down the walk and went to the Harvester's hand for grain, while\nscores of snow-white doves circled over his head. She stepped on deep\nrugs of yellow goat skins, and, glancing at the windows on either side,\nshe opened the door.\n\nOutside it lay a porch with a railing, but no roof. On each post stood a\nbox filled with yellow wood-flowers and trailing vines of pale green.\nA big tree rising through one corner of the floor supplied the cover. A\ngate opened to a walk leading to the driveway, and on either side lay\na patch of sod, outlined by a deep hedge of bright gold. In it saffron,\ncone-flowers, black-eyed Susans, golden-rod, wild sunflowers, and jewel\nflower grew, and some of it, enough to form a yellow line, was already\nin bloom. Around the porch and down the walk were beds of yellow\nviolets, pixie moss, and every tiny gold flower of the woods. The Girl\nleaned against the tree and looked around her and then staggered inside\nand dropped on the couch.\n\n“What planning! What work!” she sobbed. “What taste! Why he's a poet!\nWhat wonderful beauty! He's an artist with earth for his canvas, and\ngrowing things for colours.”\n\nShe lay there staring at the walls, the beautiful wood-work and\nfurniture, the dressing table with its array of toilet articles, a\nlow chair before it, and the thick rug for her feet. Over and over she\nlooked at everything, and then closed her eyes and lay quietly, too\nweary and overwhelmed to think. By and by came tapping at the door, and\nshe sprang up and crossing to the dressing table straightened her hair\nand composed her face.\n\n“Ajax demands to see you,” cried a gay voice.\n\nThe Girl stepped outside.\n\n“Don't be frightened if he screams at you,” warned the Harvester as she\npassed him. “He detests a stranger, and he always cries and sulks.”\n\nIt was a question what was in the head of the bird as he saw the strange\nlooking creature invading his domain, and he did scream, a wild, high,\nstrident wail that delighted the Harvester inexpressibly, because it\nsent the Girl headlong into his arms.\n\n“Oh, good gracious!” she cried. “Has such a beautiful bird got a noise\nin it like that? Why I've fed them in parks and I never heard one\nexplode before.”\n\nThen how the Harvester laughed.\n\n“But you see you are in the woods now, and this is not a park bird. It\nwill be the test of your power to see how soon you can coax him to your\nhand.”\n\n“How do I work to win him?”\n\n“I am afraid I can't tell you that,” said the Harvester. “I had to\ninvent a plan for myself. It required a long time and much petting, and\nmy methods might not avail for you. It will interest you to study that\nout. But the member of the family it is positively essential that you\nwin to a life and death allegiance is Belshazzar. If you can make him\nlove you, he will protect you at every turn. He will go before you into\nthe forest and all the crawling, creeping things will get out of his\nway. He will nose around the flowers you want to gather, and if he\ngrowls and the hair on the back of his neck rises, never forget that\nyou must heed that warning. A few times I have not stopped for it, and I\nalways have been sorry. So far as anything animate or uncertain footing\nis concerned, you are always perfectly safe if you obey him. About\ntouching plants and flowers, you must confine yourself to those you\nare certain you know, until I can teach you. There are gorgeous and\nwonderfully attractive things here, but some of them are rank poison.\nYou won't handle plants you don't know, until you learn, Ruth?”\n\n“I will not,” she promised instantly.\n\nShe went to the seat under the porch tree and leaning against the trunk\nshe studied the hill, and the rippling course of Singing Water where it\nturned and curved before the cabin, and started across the vivid little\nmarsh toward the lake. Then she looked at the Harvester. He seated\nhimself on the low railing and smiled at her.\n\n“You are very tired?” he asked.\n\n“No,” she said. “You are right about the air being better up here. It is\nstimulating instead of depressing.”\n\n“So far as pure air, location, and water are concerned,” said the\nHarvester, “I consider this place ideal. The lake is large enough to\ncool the air and raise sufficient moisture to dampen it, and too small\nto make it really cold and disagreeable. The slope of the hill gives\nperfect drainage. The heaviest rains do not wet the earth for more than\nthree hours. North, south, and west breezes sweep the cool air from the\nwater to the cabin in summer. The same suns warm us here on the winter\nhillside. My violets, spring beauties, anemones, and dutchman's breeches\nhere are always two weeks ahead of those in the woods. I am not afraid\nof your not liking the location or the air. As for the cabin, if\nyou don't care for that, it's very simple. I'll transform it into a\nlaboratory and dry-house, and build you whatever you want, within my\nmeans, over there on the hill just across Singing Water and facing\nthe valley toward Onabasha. That's a perfect location. The thing that\nworries me is what you are going to do for company, especially while I\nam away.”\n\n“Don't trouble yourself about anything,” she said. “Just say in your\nheart, 'she is going to be stronger than she ever has been in her life\nin this lovely place, and she has more right now than she ever had or\nhoped to have.' For one thing, I am going to study your books. I never\nhave had time before. While we sewed or embroidered, mother talked by\nthe hour of the great writers of the world, told me what they wrote,\nand how they expressed themselves, but I got to read very little for\nmyself.”\n\n“Books are my company,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Do your friends come often?”\n\n“Almost never! Doc and his wife come most, and if you look out some day\nand see a white-haired, bent old woman, with a face as sweet as dawn,\ncoming up the bank of Singing Water, that will be my mother's friend,\nGranny Moreland, who joins us on the north over there. She is frank and\nbrusque, so she says what she thinks with unmistakable distinctness,\nbut her heart is big and tender and her philosophy keeps her sweet and\nkindly despite the ache of rheumatism and the weight of seventy years.”\n\n“I'd love to have her come,” said the Girl. “Is that all?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Your favourite word,” laughed the Harvester. “The reason lies with me,\nor rather with my mother. Some day I will tell you the whole story,\nand the cause. I think now I can encompass it in this. The place is an\nexperiment. When medicinal herbs, roots, and barks became so scarce that\nsome of the most important were almost extinct, it occurred to me that\nit would be a good idea to stop travelling miles and poaching on the\nwoods of other people, and turn our land into an herb garden. For four\nyears before mother went, and six since, I've worked with all my might,\nand results are beginning to take shape. While I've been at it, of\ncourse, my neighbours had an inkling of what was going on, and I've been\ncalled a fool, lazy, and a fanatic, because I did not fell the trees and\nplow for corn. You readily can see I'm a little short of corn ground out\nthere,” he waved toward the marsh and lake, “and up there,” he indicated\nthe steep hill and wood. “But somewhere on this land I've been able to\nfind muck for mallows, water for flags and willows, shade for ferns,\nlilies, and ginseng, rocky, sunny spaces for mullein, and open, fertile\nbeds for Bouncing Bet----just for examples. God never evolved a place\nbetter suited for an herb farm; from woods to water and all that goes\nbetween, it is perfect.”\n\n“And indescribably lovely,” added the Girl.\n\n“Yes, I think it is,” said the Harvester. “But in the days when I didn't\nknow how it was coming out, I was sensitive about it; so I kept quiet\nand worked, and allowed the other fellow to do the talking. After a\nwhile the ginseng bed grew a treasure worth guarding, and I didn't\ncare for any one to know how much I had or where it was, as a matter\nof precaution. Ginseng and money are synonymous, and I was forced to be\naway some of the time.”\n\n“Would any one take it?”\n\n“Certainly!” said the Harvester. “If they knew it was there, and what\nit is worth. Then, as I've told you, much of the stuff here must not be\nhandled except by experts, and I didn't want people coming in my absence\nand taking risks. The remainder of my reason for living so alone is\ncowardice, pure and simple.”\n\n“Cowardice? You! Oh no!”\n\n“Thank you!” said the Harvester. “But it is! Some day I'll tell you of\na very solemn oath I've had to keep. It hasn't been easy. You wouldn't\nunderstand, at least not now. If the day ever comes when I think you\nwill, I'll tell you. Just now I can express it by that one word. I\ndidn't dare fail or I felt I would be lost as my father was before me.\nSo I remained away from the city and its temptations and men of my age,\nand worked in the woods until I was tired enough to drop, read books\nthat helped, tinkered with the carving, and sometimes I had an idea,\nand I went into that little building behind the dry-house, took out my\ndifferent herbs, and tried my hand at compounding a new cure for some of\nthe pains of humanity. It isn't bad work, Ruth. It keeps a fellow at\na fairly decent level, and some good may come of it. Carey is trying\nseveral formulae for me, and if they work I'll carry them higher. If you\nwant money, Girl, I know how to get it for you.”\n\n“Don't you want it?”\n\n“Not one cent more than I've got,” said the Harvester emphatically.\n“When any man accumulates more than he can earn with his own hands, he\nbegins to enrich himself at the expense of the youth, the sweat, the\nblood, the joy of his fellow men. I can go to the city, take a look, and\nsee what money does, as a rule, and it's another thing I'm afraid of.\nYou will find me a dreadful coward on those two points. I don't want to\nknow society and its ways. I see what it does to other men; it would be\npresumption to reckon myself stronger. So I live alone. As for money,\nI've watched the cross cuts and the quick and easy ways to accumulate\nit; but I've had something in me that held me to the slow, sure, clean\nwork of my own hands, and it's yielded me enough for one, for two even,\nin a reasonable degree. So I've worked, read, compounded, and carved. If\nI couldn't wear myself down enough to sleep by any other method, I went\ninto the lake, and swam across and back; and that is guaranteed to put\nany man to rest, clean and unashamed.”\n\n“Six years,” said the Girl softly, as she studied him. “I think it has\nset a mark on you. I believe I can trace it. Your forehead, brow,\nand eyes bear the lines and the appearance of all experience, all\ncomprehension, but your lips are those of a very young lad. I shouldn't\nbe surprised if I had that kiss ready for you, and I really believe I\ncan make it worth while.”\n\n“Oh good Lord!” cried the Harvester, turning a backward somersault over\nthe railing and starting in big bounds up the drive toward the stable.\nHe passed around it and into the woods at a rush and a few seconds later\nfrom somewhere on the top of the hill his strong, deep voice swept down,\n“Glory, glory hallelujah!”\n\nHe sang it through at the top of his lungs, that majestic old hymn,\nbut there was no music at all, it was simply a roar. By and by he came\nsoberly to the barn and paused to stroke Betsy's nose.\n\n“Stop chewing grass and listen to me,” he said. “She's here, Betsy!\nShe's in our cabin. She's going to remain, you can stake your oats\non that. She's going to be the loveliest and sweetest girl in all the\nworld, and because you're a beast, I'll tell you something a man never\ncould know. Down with your ear, you critter! She's going to kiss me,\nBetsy! This very night, before I lay me, her lips meet mine, and maybe\nyou think that won't be glorious. I supposed it would be a year, anyway,\nbut it's now! Ain't you glad you are an animal, Betsy, and can keep\nsecrets for a fool man that can't?”\n\nHe walked down the driveway, and before the Girl had a chance to speak,\nhe said, “I wonder if I had not better carry those things into your\nroom, and arrange your bed for you.”\n\n“I can,” she said.\n\n“Oh no!” exclaimed the Harvester. “You can't lift the mattress and heavy\ncovers. Hold the door and tell me how.”\n\nHe laid a big bundle on the floor, opened it, and took out the shoes.\n\n“Your shoe box is in the closet there.”\n\n“I didn't know what that door was, so I didn't open it.”\n\n“That is a part of my arrangements for you,” said the Harvester. “Here\nis a closet with shelves for your covers and other things. They are bare\nbecause I didn't know just what should be put on them. This is the shoe\nbox here in the corner; I'll put these in it now.”\n\nHe knelt and in a row set the shoes in the curly maple box and closed\nit.\n\n“There you are for all kinds of places and varieties of weather.\nThis adjoining is your bathroom. I put in towels, soaps; brushes,\nand everything I could think of, and there is hot water ready for\nyou----rain water, too.”\n\nThe Girl followed and looked into a shining little bathroom, with its\nwhite porcelain tub and wash bowl, enamelled wood-work, dainty green\nwalls, and white curtains and towels. She could see no accessory she\nknew of that was missing, and there were many things to which she never\nhad been accustomed. The Harvester had gone back to the sunshine room,\nand was kneeling on the floor beside the bundle. He began opening boxes\nand handing her dresses.\n\n“There are skirt, coat, and waist hangers on the hooks,” he said. “I\nonly got a few things to start on, because I didn't know what you would\nlike. Instead of being so careful with that dress, why don't you take it\noff, and put on a common one? Then we will have something to eat, and go\nto the top of the hill and watch the moon bridge the lake.”\n\nWhile she hung the dresses and selected the one to wear, he placed the\nmattress, spread the padding and sheets, and encased the pillow. Then he\nbent and pressed the springs with his hands.\n\n“I think you will find that soft and easy enough for health,” he said.\n“All the personal belongings I had that clerk put up for you are in that\nchest of drawers there. I put the little boxes in the top and went down.\nYou can empty and arrange them to-morrow. Just hunt out what you will\nneed now. There should be everything a girl uses there somewhere. I told\nthem to be very careful about that. If the things are not right or not\nto your taste, you can take them back as soon as you are rested, and\nthey will exchange them for you. If there is anything I have missed that\nyou can think of that you need to-night, tell me and I'll go and get\nit.”\n\nThe Girl turned toward him.\n\n“You couldn't be making sport of me,” she said, “but Man! Can't you see\nthat I don't know what to do with half you have here? I never saw such\nthings closely before. I don't know what they are for. I don't know how\nto use them. My mother would have known, but I do not. You overwhelm me!\nFifty times I've tried to tell you that a room of my very own, such\na room as this will be when to-morrow's sun comes in, and these, and\nthese, and these,” she turned from the chest of boxes to the dressing\ntable, bed, closet, and bath, “all these for me, and you know absolutely\nnothing about me----I get a big lump in my throat, and the words that\ndo come all seem so meaningless, I am perfectly ashamed to say them. Oh\nMan, why do you do it?”\n\n“I thought it was about time to spring another 'why' on me,” said the\nHarvester. “Thank God, I am now in a position where I can tell you\n'why'! I do it because you are the girl of my dream, my mate by every\nlaw of Heaven and earth. All men build as well as they know when the one\nwoman of the universe lays her spell on them. I did all this for myself\njust as a kind of expression of what it would be in my heart to do if I\ncould do what I'd like. Put on the easiest dress you can find and I will\ngo and set out something to eat.”\n\nShe stood with arms high piled with the prettiest dresses that could be\nselected hurriedly, the tears running down her white cheeks and smiled\nthrough them at him.\n\n“There wouldn't be any of that liquid amber would there?” she asked.\n\n“Quarts!” cried the Harvester. “I'll bring some. ... Does it really hit\nthe spot, Ruth?” he questioned as he handed her the glass.\n\nShe heaped the dresses on the bed and took it.\n\n“It really does. I am afraid I am using too much.”\n\n“I don't think it possibly can hurt you. To-morrow we will ask Doc. How\nsoon will you be ready for lunch?”\n\n“I don't want a bite.”\n\n“You will when you see and smell it,” said the Harvester. “I am an\nexpert cook. It's my chiefest accomplishment. You should taste the\ndishes I improvise. But there won't be much to-night, because I want you\nto see the moon rise over the lake.”\n\nHe went away and the Girl removed her dress and spread it on the couch.\nThen she bathed her face and hands. When she saw the discoloured cloth,\nit proved that she had been painted, and made her very indignant. Yet\nshe could not be altogether angry, for that flush of colour had saved\nthe Harvester from being pitied by his friend. She stood a long time\nbefore the mirror, staring at her gaunt, colourless face; then she went\nto the dressing table and committed a crime. She found a box of cream\nand rubbed it on for a foundation. Then she opened some pink powder, and\ncarefully dusted her cheeks.\n\n“I am utterly ashamed,” she said to the image in the mirror, “but he\nhas done so much for me, he is so, so----I don't know a word big\nenough----that I can't bear him to see how ghastly I am, how little\nworth it. Perhaps the food, better air, and outdoor exercise will give\nme strength and colour soon. Until it does I'm afraid I'm going to help\nout all I can with this. It is wonderful how it changes one. I really\nappear like a girl instead of a bony old woman.”\n\nThen she looked over the dresses, selected a pretty white princesse,\nslipped it on, and went to the kitchen. But the Harvester would not\nhave her there. He seated her at the dining table, beside the window\noverlooking the lake, lighted a pair of his home-made candles in his\nfinest sticks, and placed before her bread, butter, cold meat, milk, and\nfruit, and together they ate their first meal in their home.\n\n“If I had known,” said the Harvester, “Granny Moreland is a famous cook.\nShe is a Southern woman, and she can fry chicken and make some especial\ndishes to surpass any one I ever knew. She would have been so pleased to\ncome over and get us an all-right supper.”\n\n“I'd much rather have this, and be by ourselves,” said the Girl.\n\n“Well, you can bank on it, I would,” agreed the Harvester. “For\ninstance, if any one were here, I might feel restrained about telling\nyou that you are exactly the beautiful, flushed Dream Girl I have adored\nfor months, and your dress most becoming. You are a picture to blind the\neyes of a lonely bachelor, Ruth.”\n\n“Oh why did you say that?” wailed the Girl. “Now I've got to feel like a\nsneak or tell you----and I didn't want you to know.”\n\n“Don't you ever tell me or any one else anything you don't want to,”\n said the Harvester roundly. “It's nobody's business!”\n\n“But I must! I can't begin with deception. I was fool enough to think\nyou wouldn't notice. Man, they painted me! I didn't know they were doing\nit, but when it all washed off, I looked so ghastly I almost frightened\nmyself. I hunted through the boxes they put up for you and found some\npink powder----”\n\n“But don't all the daintiest women powder these days, and consider it\nindispensable? The clerk said so, and I've noticed it mentioned in the\npapers. I bought it for you to use.”\n\n“Yes, just powder, but Man, I put on a lot of cold cream first to stick\nthe powder good and thick. Oh I wish I hadn't!”\n\n“Well since you've told it, is your conscience perfectly at ease? No\nyou don't! You sit where you are! You are lovely, and if you don't use\nenough powder to cover the paleness, until your colour returns, I'll\nhold you and put it on. I know you feel better when you appear so that\nevery one must admire you.”\n\n“Yes, but I'm a fraud!”\n\n“You are no such thing!” cried the Harvester hotly. “There hasn't a\nwoman in ten thousand got any such rope of hair. I have been seeing the\npapers on the hair question, too. No one will believe it's real. If they\nthink your hair is false, when it is natural, they won't be any more\nfooled when they think your colour is real, and it isn't. Very soon it\nwill be and no one need ever know the difference. You go on and fix up\nyour level best. To see yourself appearing well will make you ambitious\nto become so as soon as possible.”\n\n“Harvester-man,” said the Girl, gazing at him with wet luminous eyes,\n“for the sake of other women, I could wish that all men had an oath to\nkeep, and had been reared in the woods.”\n\n“Here is the place we adjourn to the moon,” cried the Harvester. “I\ndon't know of anything that can cure a sudden accession of swell\nhead like gazing at the heavens. One finds his place among the atoms\nnaturally and instantaneously with the eyes on the night sky. Should\nyou have a wrap? You should! The mists from the lake are cool. I don't\nbelieve there is one among my orders. I forgot that. But upstairs with\nmother's clothing there are several shawls and shoulder capes. All of\nthem were washed and carefully packed. Would you use one, Ruth?”\n\n“Why not give it to me. Wouldn't she like me to wear her things better\nthan to have them lying in moth balls?”\n\nThe Harvester looked at her and shook his head, marvelling.\n\n“I can't tell how pleased she would be,” he said.\n\n“Where are her belongings?” asked the Girl. “I could use them to help\nfurnish the house, and it wouldn't appear so strange to you.”\n\nThe Harvester liked that.\n\n“All the washed things are in those boxes upstairs; also some fine skins\nI've saved on the chance of wanting them. Her dishes are in the bottom\nof the china closet there; she was mighty proud of them. The furniture\nand carpets were so old and abused I burned them. I'll go bring a wrap.”\n\nHe took the candle and climbed the stairs, soon returning with a little\nwhite wool shawl and a big pink coverlet.\n\n“Got this for her Christmas one time,” he said. “She'd never had a white\none and she thought it was pretty.”\n\nHe folded it around the Girl's shoulders and picked up the coverlet.\n\n“You're never going to take that to the woods!” she cried.\n\n“Why not?”\n\nShe took it in her hands to find a corner.\n\n“Just as I thought! It's a genuine Peter Hartman! It's one of the things\nthat money can't buy, or, rather, one that takes a mint of money to own.\nThey are heirlooms. They are not manufactured any more. At the art store\nwhere I worked they'd give you fifty dollars for that. It is not faded\nor worn a particle. It would be lovely in my room; you mustn't take a\ntreasure like that out of doors.”\n\n“Ruth, are you in earnest?” demanded the Harvester. “I believe there are\nsix of them upstairs.”\n\n“Plutocrat!” cried the Girl. “What colours?”\n\n“More of this pinkish red, blue, and pale green.”\n\n“Famous! May I have them to help furnish with to-morrow?”\n\n“Certainly! Anything you can find, any way on earth you want it, only\nin my room. That is taboo, as I told you. What am I going to take\nto-night?”\n\n“Isn't the rug you had in the woods in the wagon yet? Use that!”\n\n“Of course! The very thing! Bel, proceed!”\n\n“Are you going to leave the house like this?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Suppose some one breaks in!”\n\n“Nothing worth carrying away, except what you have on. No one to get in.\nThere is a big swamp back of our woods, marsh in front, we're up here\nwhere we can see the drive and bridge. There is nothing possible from\nany direction. Never locked the cabin in my life, except your room, and\nthat was because it was sacred, not that there was any danger. Clear the\nway, Bel!”\n\n“Clear it of what?”\n\n“Katydids, hoptoads, and other carnivorous animals.”\n\n“Now you are making fun of me! Clear it of what?”\n\n“A coon that might go shuffling across, an opossum, or a snake going to\nthe lake. Now are you frightened so that you will not go?”\n\n“No. The path is broad and white and surely you and Bel can take care of\nme.”\n\n“If you will trust us we can.”\n\n“Well, I am trusting you.”\n\n“You are indeed,” said the Harvester. “Now see if you think this is\npretty.”\n\nHe indicated the hill sloping toward the lake. The path wound among\nmassive trees, between whose branches patches of moonlight filtered.\nAround the lake shore and climbing the hill were thickets of bushes.\nThe water lay shining in the light, a gentle wind ruffled the surface\nin undulant waves, and on the opposite bank arose the line of big\ntrees. Under a giant oak widely branching, on the top of the hill, the\nHarvester spread the rug and held one end of it against the tree trunk\nto protect the Girl's dress. Then he sat a little distance away and\nbegan to talk. He mingled some sense with a quantity of nonsense, and\nappreciated every hint of a laugh he heard. The day had been no amusing\nmatter for a girl absolutely alone among strange people and scenes.\nAnything more foreign to her previous environment or expectations he\ncould not imagine. So he talked to prevent her from thinking, and worked\nfor a laugh as he laboured for bread.\n\n“Now we must go,” he said at last. “If there is the malaria I strongly\nsuspect in your system, this night air is none too good for you. I only\nwanted you to see the lake the first night in your new home, and if it\nwon't shock you, I brought you here because this is my holy of holies.\nCan you guess why I wanted you to come, Ruth?”\n\n“If I wasn't so stupid with alternate burning and chills, and so\ndeadened to every proper sensibility, I suppose I could,” she answered,\n“but I'm not brilliant. I don't know, unless it is because you knew it\nwould be the loveliest place I ever saw. Surely there is no other spot\nin the world quite so beautiful.”\n\n“Then would it seem strange to you,” asked the Harvester going to the\nGirl and gently putting his arms around her, “would it seem strange to\nyou, that a woman who once homed here and thought it the prettiest place\non earth, chose to remain for her eternal sleep, rather than to rest in\na distant city of stranger dead?”\n\nHe felt the Girl tremble against him.\n\n“Where is she?”\n\n“Very close,” said the Harvester. “Under this oak. She used to say that\nshe had a speaking acquaintance with every tree on our land, and of them\nall she loved this big one the best. She liked to come here in winter,\nand feel the sting of the wind sweeping across the lake, and in summer\nthis was her place to read and to think. So when she slept the unwaking\nsleep, Ruth, I came here and made her bed with my own hands, and then\ncarried her to it, covered her, and she sleeps well. I never have\nregretted her going. Life did not bring her joy. She was very tired.\nShe used to say that after her soul had fled, if I would lay her here,\nperhaps the big roots would reach down and find her, and from her frail\nframe gather slight nourishment and then her body would live again in\ntalking leaves that would shelter me in summer and whisper her love in\nwinter. Of all Medicine Woods this is the dearest spot to me. Can you\nlove it too, Ruth?”\n\n“Oh I can!” cried the Girl; “I do now! Just to see the place and hear\nthat is enough. I wish, oh to my soul I wish----”\n\n“You wish what?” whispered the Harvester gently.\n\n“I dare not! I was wild to think of it. I would be ungrateful to ask\nit.”\n\n“You would be ungracious if you didn't ask anything that would give\nme the joy of pleasing you. How long is it going to require for you\nto learn, Ruth, that to make up for some of the difficulties life has\nbrought you would give me more happiness than anything else could? Tell\nme now.”\n\n“No!”\n\nHe gathered her closer.\n\n“Ruth, there is no reason why you should be actively unkind to me. What\nis it you wish?”\n\nShe struggled from his arms and stood alone in white moonlight, staring\nacross the lake, along the shore, deep into the perfumed forest, and\nthen at the mound she now could distinguish under the giant tree.\nSuddenly she went to him and with both shaking hands gripped his arm.\n\n“My mother!” she panted. “Oh she was a beautiful woman, delicately\nreared, and her heart was crushed and broken. By the inch she went to\na dreadful end I could not avert or allay, and in poverty and grime I\nfought for a way to save her body from further horror, and it's all so\ndreadful I thought all feeling in me was dried and still, but I am not\nquite calloused yet. I suffer it over with every breath. It is never\nentirely out of my mind. Oh Man, if only you would lift her from the\nhorrible place she lies, where briers run riot and cattle trample and\nthe unmerciful sun beats! Oh if only you'd lift her from it, and bring\nher here! I believe it would take away some of the horror, the shame,\nand the heartache. I believe I could go to sleep without hearing the\nvoice of her suffering, if I knew she was lying on this hill, under your\nbeautiful tree, close the dear mother you love. Oh Man, would you----?”\n\nThe Harvester crushed the Girl in his arms and shuddering sobs shook his\nbig frame, and choked his voice.\n\n“Ruth, for God's sake, be quiet!” he cried. “Why I'd be glad to! I'll go\nanywhere you tell me, and bring her, and she shall rest where the lake\nmurmurs, the trees shelter, the winds sing, and earth knows the sun only\nin long rays of gold light.”\n\nShe stared at him with strained face.\n\n“You----you wouldn't!” she breathed.\n\n“Ruth, child,” said the Harvester, “I tell you I'd be happy. Look at\nmy side of this! I'm in search of bands to bind you to me and to this\nplace. Could you tell me a stronger than to have the mother you idolized\nlie here for her long sleep? Why Girl, you can't know the deep and\nabiding joy it would give me to bring her. I'd feel I had you almost\nsecure. Where is she Ruth?”\n\n“In that old unkept cemetery south of Onabasha, where it costs no money\nto lay away your loved ones.”\n\n“Close here! Why I'll go to-morrow! I supposed she was in the city.”\n\nShe straightened and drew away from him.\n\n“How could I? I had nothing. I could not have paid even her fare and\nbrought her here in the cheapest box the decency of man would allow\nhim to make if her doctor had not given me the money I owe. Now do\nyou understand why I must earn and pay it myself? Save for him, it was\ncharity or her delicate body to horrors. Money never can repay him.”\n\n“Ruth, the day you came to Onabasha was she with you?”\n\n“In the express car,” said the Girl.\n\n“Where did you go when you left the train shed?”\n\n“Straight to the baggage room, where Uncle Henry was waiting. Men\nbrought and put her in his wagon, and he drove with me to the place and\nother men lowered her, and that was all.”\n\n“You poor Girl!” cried the Harvester. “This time to-morrow night she\nshall sleep in luxury under this oak, so help me God! Ruth, can you\nspare me? May I go at once? I can't rest, myself.”\n\n“You will?” cried the Girl. “You will?”\n\nShe was laughing in the moonlight. “Oh Man, I can't ever, ever tell\nyou!”\n\n“Don't try,” said the Harvester. “Call it settled. I will start early\nin the morning. I know that little cemetery. The man whose land it is\non can point me the spot. She is probably the last one laid there. Come\nnow, Ruth. Go to the room I made for you, and sleep deeply and in peace.\nWill you try to rest?”\n\n“Oh David!” she exulted. “Only think! Here where it's clean and cool;\nbeside the lake, where leaves fall gently and I can come and sit close\nto her and bring flowers; and she never will be alone, for your dear\nmother is here. Oh David!”\n\n“It is better. I can't thank you enough for thinking of it. Come now,\nlet me help you.”\n\nHe half carried her down the hill. Then he made the cabin a glamour of\nlight by putting candles in the sticks he had carved and placing them\neverywhere.\n\n“There is a lighting plant in the basement,” he said, “but I had not\nexpected to use it until winter, and I have no acetylene. Candles were\nour grandmothers' lights and they are the best anyway. Go bathe your\nface, Ruth, and wash away all trace of tears. Put on the pink powder,\nand in a few weeks you will have colour to outdo the wildest rose. You\nmust be as gay as you can the remainder of this night.”\n\n“I will!” cried the Girl. “I will! Oh I didn't know a thing on earth\ncould make me happy! I didn't know I really could be glad. Oh if the ice\nin my heart would melt, and the wall break down, and the girlhood I've\nnever known would come yet! Oh David, if it would!”\n\n“Before the Lord it shall!” vowed the Harvester. “It shall come with the\nfulness of joy right here in Medicine Woods. Think it! Believe it! Keep\nit before you! Work for it! Happiness is worth while! All of us have a\nright to it! It shall be yours and soon.”\n\n“I will try! I will!” promised the Girl. “I'll go right now and I'll put\non the blessed pink powder so thickly you'll never know what is under\nit, and soon it won't be needed at all.”\n\nShe was laughing as she left the room. The Harvester restlessly walked\nthe floor a few minutes and then sat with a notebook and began entering\nstems.\n\nWhen the Girl returned, he brought the pillow from her bed, folded the\ncoverlet, and she lay on them in the big swing. He covered her with the\nwhite shawl, and while Singing Water sang its loudest, katydids exulted\nover the delightful act of their ancestor, and a million gauze-winged\ncreatures of night hummed against the screen, in a voice soft and low he\ntold her in a steady stream, as he swayed her back and forth, what each\nsound of the night was, and how and why it was made all the way from the\nrumbling buzz of the June bug to the screech of the owl and the splash\nof the bass in the lake. All of it, as it appealed to him, was the story\nof steady evolution, the natural processes of reproduction, the joy of\nlife and its battles, and the conquest of the strong in nature. At his\nhands every sound was stripped of terror. The leaping bass was exulting\nin life, the screeching owl was telling its mate it had found a fat\nmouse for the children, the nighthawk was courting, the big bull frogs\nbooming around the lake were serenading the moon. There was not a thing\nto fear or a voice left with an unsympathetic note in it. She was half\nasleep when at last he helped her to her room, set a pitcher of frosty,\nclinking drink on her table, locked her door and window screens inside,\nspread Belshazzar's blanket on her porch, and set his door wide open,\nthat he might hear if she called, and then said good night and went back\nto his memorandum book.\n\n“No bad beginning,” he muttered softly, “no bad beginning, but I'd\nalmost give my right hand if she hadn't forgotten----”\n\nIn her room the exhausted Girl slipped the pins from her hair and sank\non the low chair before the dressing-table. She picked up the shining,\nsilver backed brush and stared at the monogram, R. F. L, entwined on it.\n\n“My soul!” she exclaimed. “WAS HE SO SURE AS THAT? Was there ever any\nother man like him?”\n\nShe dropped the brush and with tired hands pushed back the heavy braids.\nThen she arose and going to the chest of drawers began lifting lids to\nfind a night robe. As she searched the boxes she found every dainty,\npretty undergarment a girl ever used and at last the robes. She shook\nout a long white one, slipped into it, and walked to the bed. That stood\nas he had arranged it, white, clean, and dainty.\n\n“Everything for me!” she said softly. “Everything for me! Shall there be\nnothing for him? Oh he makes it easy, easy!”\n\nShe stepped to the closet, picked down a lavender silk kimona and\ndrawing it over her gown she gathered it around her and opening\nthe bathroom door, she stepped into a little hall leading to the\ndining-room. As she entered the living-room the Harvester bent over his\nbook. Her step was very close when he heard it and turned his head. In\nan instant she touched his shoulders. The Harvester dropped the pencil,\nand palm downward laid his hands on the table, his promise strong in\nhis heart. The Girl slid a shaking palm under his chin, leaned his head\nagainst her breast, and dropped a sweet, tear-wet face on his. With all\nthe strength of her frail arms she gripped him a second, and then gave\nthe kiss, into which she tried to put all she could find no words to\nexpress.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. SNOWY WINGS\n\nThe Harvester sat at the table in deep thoughts until the lights in the\nGirl's room were darkened and everything was quiet. Then he locked\nthe screens inside and went into the night. The moon flooded all the\nhillside, until coarse print could have been read with keen eyes in its\nlight. A restlessness, born of exultation he could not allay or control,\nwas on him. She had not forgotten! After this, the dream would be\neffaced by reality. It was the beginning. He scarcely had dared hope for\nso much. Surely it presaged the love with which she some day would\ncome to him and crown his life. He walked softly up and down the drive,\npassing her windows, unable to think of sleep. Over and over he dwelt on\nthe incidents of the day, so inevitably he came to his promise.\n\n“Merciful Heaven!” he muttered. “How can such things happen? The poor,\noverworked, tired, suffering girl. It will give her some comfort. She\nwill feel better. It has to be done. I believe I will do the worst part\nof it while she sleeps.”\n\nHe went to the cabin, crept very close to one of her windows and\nlistened intently. Surely no mortal awake could lie motionless so long.\nShe must be sleeping. He patted Belshazzar, whispered, “Watch, boy,\nwatch for your life!” and then crossed to the dry-house. Beside it he\nfound a big roll of coffee sacks that he used in collecting roots, and\ngoing to the barn, he took a spade and mattock. Then he climbed the hill\nto the oak; in the white moonlight laid off his measurements and began\nwork. His heart was very tender as he lifted the earth, and threw it\ninto the tops of the big bags he had propped open.\n\n“I'll line it with a couple of sheets and finish the edge with pond\nlilies and ferns,” he planned, “and I'll drag this earth from sight, and\ncover it with brush until I need it.”\n\nSometimes he paused in his work to rest a few minutes and then he stood\nand glanced around him. Several times he went down the hill and slipped\nclose to a window, but he could not hear a sound. When his work was\nfinished, he stood before the oak, scraping clinging earth from the\nmattock with which he had cut roots he had been compelled to remove.\nHe was tired now and he thought he would go to his room and sleep until\ndaybreak. As he turned the implement he remembered how through it he\nhad found her, and now he was using it in her service. He smiled as he\nworked, and half listened to the steady roll of sound encompassing him.\nA cool breath swept from the lake and he wondered if it found her wet,\nhot cheek. A wild duck in the rushes below gave an alarm signal, and\nit ran in subdued voice, note by note, along the shore. The Harvester\ngripped the mattock and stood motionless. Wild things had taught him so\nmany lessons he heeded their warnings instinctively. Perhaps it was a\nmink or muskrat approaching the rushes. Listening intently, he heard a\nstealthy step coming up the path behind him.\n\nThe Harvester waited. He soundlessly moved around the trunk of the big\ntree. An instant more the night prowler stopped squarely at the head of\nthe open grave, and jumped back with an oath. He stood tense a second,\nthen advanced, scratched a match and dropped it into the depths of the\nopening. That instant the Harvester recognized Henry Jameson, and with\na spring landed between the man's shoulders and sent him, face down,\nheadlong into the grave. He snatched one of the sacks of earth, and\ntipping it, gripped the bottom and emptied the contents on the head\nand shoulders of the prostrate man. Then he dropped on him and feeling\nacross his back took an ugly, big revolver from a pocket. He swung to\nthe surface and waited until Henry Jameson crawled from under the weight\nof earth and began to rise; then, at each attempt, he knocked him down.\nAt last he caught the exhausted man by the collar and dragged him to the\npath, where he dropped him and stood gloating.\n\n“So!” he said; “It's you! Coming to execute your threat, are you? What's\nthe matter with my finishing you, loading your carcass with a few stones\ninto this sack, and dropping you in the deepest part of the lake.”\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n“Ain't you a little hasty?” asked the Harvester. “Isn't it rather cold\nblooded to come sneaking when you thought I'd be asleep? Don't you think\nit would be low down to kill a man on his wedding day?”\n\nHenry Jameson arose cautiously and faced the Harvester.\n\n“Who have you killed?” he panted.\n\n“No one,” answered the Harvester. “This is for the victim of a member of\nyour family, but I never dreamed I'd have the joy of planting any of\nyou in it first, even temporarily. Did you rest well? What I should have\ndone was to fill in, tread down, and leave you at the bottom.”\n\nJameson retreated a few steps. The Harvester laughed and advanced the\nsame distance.\n\n“Now then,” he said, “explain what you are doing on my premises, a few\nhours after your threat, and armed with another revolver before I could\nreturn the one I took from you this afternoon. You must grow them on\nbushes at your place, they seem so numerous. Speak up! What are you\ndoing here?”\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“There are three things it might be,” mused the Harvester. “You might\nthink to harm me, but you're watched on that score and I don't believe\nyou'd enjoy the result sure to follow. You might contemplate trying to\nsteal Ruth's money again, but we'll pass that up. You might want to go\nthrough my woods to inform yourself as to what I have of value there.\nBut, in all prob-ability, you are after me. Well, here I am. Go ahead!\nDo what you came to!”\n\nThe Harvester stepped toward the lake bank and Jameson, turning to watch\nhim, exposed a face ghastly through its grime.\n\n“Look here!” cried the Harvester, sickening. “We will end this right\nnow. I was rather busy this afternoon, but I wasn't too hurried to take\nthat little weapon of yours to the chief of police and tell him where\nand how I got it and what occurred. He was to return it to you\nto-morrow with his ultimatum. When I have added the history of to-night,\nreinforced by another gun, he will understand your intentions and know\nwhere you belong. You should be confined, but because your name is the\nsame as the Girl's, and there is of your blood in her veins, I'll give\nyou one more chance. I'll let you go this time, but I'll report you, and\ndeliver this implement to be added to your collection at headquarters.\nAnd I tell you, and I'll tell them, that if ever I find you on my\npremises again, I'll finish you on sight. Is that clear?”\n\nJameson nodded.\n\n“What I should do is to plump you squarely into confinement, as I could\neasily enough, but that's not my way. I am going to let you off, but you\ngo knowing the law. One thing more: Don't leave with any distorted ideas\nin your head. I saw Ruth the day she stepped from the cars in Onabasha\nand I loved her. I wanted to court and marry her, as any man would the\ngirl he loves, but you spoiled that with your woman killing brutality.\nSo I married her in Onabasha this afternoon. You can see the records at\nthe county clerk's office and interview the minister who performed the\nceremony, if you doubt me. Ruth is in her room, comfortable as I can\nmake her, asleep and unafraid, thank God! This grave is for her mother.\nThe Girl wants her lifted from the horrible place you put her, and laid\nwhere it is sheltered and pleasant. Now, I'll see you off my land. Hurry\nyourself!”\n\nWith the Harvester following, Henry Jameson went back over the path he\nhad come, until he reached and mounted the horse he had ridden. As the\nHarvester watched him, Jameson turned in the saddle and spoke for the\nsecond time.\n\n“What will you give me in cold cash to tell you who she is, and where\nher mother's people are?”\n\nThe Harvester leaped for the bridle and missed. Jameson bent over\nthe horse and lashed it to a run. Half way to the oak the Harvester\nremembered the revolver, but being unaccustomed to weapons, he had\nforgotten it when he needed it most. He replaced the earth in the sack\nand dragged it away, then plunged into the lake, and afterward went\nto bed, where he slept soundly until dawn. First, he slipped into the\nliving-room and wrote a note to the Girl. Then he fed Belshazzar and ate\na hearty breakfast. He stationed the dog at her door, gave him the\nnote, and went to the oak. There he arranged everything neatly and as\nhe desired, and then hitching Betsy he quietly guided her down the drive\nand over the road to Onabasha. He went to an undertaking establishment,\nmade all his arrangements, and then called up and talked with the\nminister who had performed the marriage ceremony the previous day.\n\nThe sun shining in her face awoke Ruth and she lay revelling in the\nlight. “Maybe it will colour me faster than the powder,” she thought.\n“How peculiar for him to say what he did! I always thought men detested\nit. But he is not like any one else.” She lay looking around the\nbeautiful room and wondering where the Harvester was. She could not hear\nhim. Then, slowly and painfully, she dragged her aching limbs from the\nbed and went to the door. The dog was gone from the porch and she could\nnot see the man at the stable. She selected a frock and putting it on\nopened the door. Belshazzar arose and offered this letter:\n\nDEAR RUTH:\n\nI have gone to keep my promise. You are locked in with Bel. Please obey\nme and do not step outside the door until four o'clock. Then put on a\npretty white dress, and with the dog, come to the bridge to meet me. I\nhope you will not suffer and fret. Put away your clothing, arrange the\nrooms to keep busy, or better yet, lie in the swing and rest. There is\nfood in the ice chest, pantry, and cellar. Forgive me for leaving you\nto-day, but I thought you would feel easier to have this over. I am so\nglad to bring your mother here. I hope it will make you happy enough\nto meet us with a smile. Do not forget the pink box until the reality\ncomes.\n\nWith love,\n\nDAVID.\n\n\nThe Girl went to the kitchen and found food. She offered to share with\nBelshazzar, but she could see from his indifference he was not hungry.\nThen she returned to the room flooded with light, and filled with\ntreasures, and tried to decide how she would arrange her clothing. She\nspent hours opening boxes and putting dainty, pretty garments in the\ndrawers, hanging the dresses, and placing the toilet articles. Often\nshe wearily dropped to the chairs and couches, or gazed from door and\nwindows at the pictures they framed. “I wonder why he doesn't want me to\ngo outside,” she thought. “I wouldn't be afraid in the least, with Bel.\nI'd just love to go across to that wonderful little river of Singing\nWater and sit in the shade; but I won't open the door until four\no'clock, just as he wrote.”\n\nWhen she thought of where he had gone, and why, the swift tears filled\nher eyes, but she forced them back and resolutely went to investigate\nthe dining-room. Then for two hours she was a home builder, with a touch\nof that homing instinct found in the heart of every good woman. First,\nshe looked where the Harvester had said the dishes were, and suddenly\nsat on the floor exulting. There was a quantity of old chipped and\ncracked white ware and some gorgeous baking powder prizes; but there\nwere also big blue, green, and pink bowls, several large lustre plates,\nand a complete tea set without chip or blemish, two beautiful pitchers,\nand a number of willow pieces. She set the green bowl on the dining\ntable, the blue on the living-room, and took the pink herself, while a\nbeautiful yellow one she placed in the dining-room window seat.\n\n“Oh, if I only dared fill them with those lovely flowers!” She stood in\nthe window and gazed longingly toward the lake. “I know what colour I'd\nlike to put in each of them,” she said, “but I promised not to touch\nanything, and the ones I want most I never saw before, and I'm not to go\nout anyway. I can't see the sense in that, when I'm not at all afraid,\nbut if he does this wonderful thing for me I must do what he asks. Oh\nmother, mother! Are you really coming to this beautiful place and to\nrest at last?”\n\nShe sank to the window seat and lay trembling, but she bravely\nrestrained the tears. After a time she remembered the upstairs and went\nto see the coverlets. She found a half dozen beautiful ones, and smiled\nas she examined the stiffly conventionalized birds facing each other in\nthe border designs, and in one corner of each blanket she read, woven in\nthe cloth----\n\n     Peter and John\n        Hartman\n        Wooster\n         Ohio\n         1837\n\nShe took a blue and a green one, several fine skins from the fur box the\nHarvester had told her about, and went downstairs. It required all her\nstrength to push the heavy tables before the fireplaces. She spread\npapers on them to stand on, and tacked a skin above each mantel. She set\nall of the candlesticks, except those she wanted to use, in the lower\npart of an empty bookcase. A pair of black walnut she placed on the\nliving-room mantel, together with a big blue plate, a yellow one, and an\nold brass candlestick. She admired the effect very much. She spread the\nblue coverlet on the couch, and arranged the blue bowl and some books on\nthe table. Here and there she hung a skin across a chair back, or\nspread it in a wide window seat. Having exhausted all her resources, she\nreturned to the dining-room, spread a skin before the hearth and in each\nwindow seat, set a pink and green lustre plate on the mantel, and a pair\nof oak candlesticks, and arranged the lustre tea set on the side table.\nThe pink coverlet she took for herself, and after resting a time she was\nsurprised on going back to the rooms to see how homelike they appeared.\n\nAt three o'clock she dressed and at almost four unlocked the screen,\ncalled Belshazzar to her side, and slowly went down the drive to the\nbridge. She had used the pink powder, put on a beautiful white dress,\ncarefully arranged her hair, and she wore the pearl ornament. Once her\nfingers strayed to the pendant and she said softly, “I think both he and\nmother would like me to wear it.”\n\nAt the foot of the hill she stopped at a bench and sat in the shade\nwaiting. Belshazzar stretched beside her, and gazed at her with\nquestioning, friendly dog eyes. The Girl looked from Singing Water to\nthe lake, and up the hill to make sure it was real. She tried to quiet\nher quivering muscles and nerves. He had asked her to meet him with a\nsmile. How could she? He could not have understood what it meant when\nhe made the request. There never would be any way to make him realize;\nindeed, why should he? The smile must be ready. He had loved his mother\ndeeply, and yet he had said he did not grieve to lay her to rest. Earth\nhad not been kind. Then why should she sorrow for her mother? Again life\nhad been not only unkind, but bitterly cruel.\n\nBelshazzar arose and watched down the drive. The Girl looked also.\nThrough the gate and up the levee came a strange procession. First\nwalked the Harvester alone, with bared head, and he carried an arm load\nof white lilies. A carriage containing a man and several women followed.\nThen came a white hearse with snowy plumes, and behind that another\ncarriage filled with people, and Betsy followed drawing men in the\nspring wagon. The Girl arose and as she stepped to the drive she swayed\nuncertainly an instant.\n\n“Gracious Heaven!” she gasped. “He is bringing her in white, and with\nflowers and song!”\n\nThen she lifted her head, and with a smile on her lips she went to meet\nhim. As she reached his side, he tenderly put an arm around her, and\ncame on steadily.\n\n“Courage Girl!” he whispered. “Be as brave as she was!”\n\nAround the driveway and up the hill he half carried her, to a seat he\nhad placed under the oak. Before her lay the white-lined grave, and the\nHarvester arranged his lilies around it. The teams stopped at the barn\nand men came up the hill bearing a white burden. Behind them followed\nthe minister who yesterday had performed their marriage ceremony, and\nafter him a choir of trained singers softly chanting:\n\n     “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,\n     For they shall cease from their labours.”\n\n\n“But David,” panted the Girl, “It was mean and poor. That is not she!”\n\n“Sush!” said the Harvester. “It is your mother. The location was high\nand dry, and it has been only a short time. We wrapped her in white\nsilk, laid her on a soft cushion and pillow, and housed her securely.\nShe can sleep well now, Ruth. Listen!”\n\nCovered with white lilies, slowly the casket sank into earth. At its\nhead stood the minister and as it began to disappear, the white doves,\nfrightened by the strange conveyances at the stable, came circling\nabove. The minister looked up. He lifted a clear tenor, and softly and\npurely he sang, while at a wave of his hand the choir joined him:\n\n     “Oh, come angel band!  Oh, come, and around me stand!\n     Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings to my immortal home!”\n\n\nHe uttered a low benediction, and singing, the people turned and went\ndownhill. The Harvester gathered the Girl in his arms and carried her to\nthe lake. He laid her in his boat and taking the oars sent it along the\nbank in the shade, and through cool, green places.\n\n“Now cry all you choose!” he said.\n\nThe overstrained Girl covered her face and sobbed wildly. After a time\nhe began to talk to her gently, and before she realized it, she was\nlistening.\n\n“Death has been kinder to her than life, Ruth,” he said. “She is lying\nas you saw her last, I think. We lifted her very tenderly, wrapped\nher carefully, and brought her gently as we could. Now they shall rest\ntogether, those little mothers of ours, to whom men were not kind; and\nin the long sleep we must forget, as they have forgotten, and forgive,\nas no doubt they have forgiven. Don't you want to take some lilies to\nthem before we go to the cabin? Right there on your left are unusually\nlarge ones.”\n\nThe Girl sat up, dried her eyes and gathered the white flowers. When the\nlast vehicle crossed the bridge, the Harvester tied the boat and helped\nher up the hill. The old oak stretched its wide arms above two little\nmounds, both moss covered and scattered with flowers. The Girl added her\nstore and then went to the Harvester, and sank at his feet.\n\n“Ruth, you shall not!” cried the man. “I simply will not have that. Come\nnow, I will bring you back this evening.”\n\nHe helped her to the veranda and laid her in the swing. He sat beside\nher while she rested, and then they went into the cabin for supper. Soon\nhe had her telling what she had found, and he was making notes of what\nwas yet required to transform the cabin into a home. The Harvester left\nit to her to decide whether he should roof the bridge the next day or\nmake a trip for furnishings. She said he had better buy what they\nneeded and then she could make the cabin homelike while he worked on the\nbridge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. THE HARVESTER INTERPRETS LIFE\n\nThey went through the rooms together, and the Girl suggested the\nfurnishings she thought necessary, while the Harvester wrote the list.\nThe following morning he was eager to have her company, but she was very\ntired and begged to be allowed to wait in the swing, so again he drove\naway and left her with Belshazzar on guard. When he had gone, she went\nthrough the cabin arranging the furniture the best she could, then\ndressed and went to the swinging couch. It was so wide and heavy a light\nwind rocked it gently, and from it she faced the fern and lily carpeted\nhillside, the majesty of big trees of a thousand years, and heard the\nmusic of Singing Water as it sparkled diamond-like where the sun rays\nstruck its flow. Across the drive and down the valley to the brilliant\nbit of marsh it hurried on its way to Loon Lake.\n\nThere were squirrels barking and racing in the big trees and over the\nground. They crossed the sodded space of lawn and came to the top step\nfor nuts, eating them from cunning paws. They were living life according\nto the laws of their nature. She knew that their sharp, startling bark\nwas not to frighten her, but to warn straying intruders of other species\nof their kindred from a nest, because the Harvester had told her so. He\nhad said their racing here and there in wild scramble was a game of tag\nand she found it most interesting to observe.\n\nBirds of brilliant colour flashed everywhere, singing in wild joy, and\ntilted on the rising hedge before her, hunting berries and seeds. Their\nbubbling, spontaneous song was an instinctive outpouring of their joy\nover mating time, nests, young, much food, and running water. Their\nsocial, inquiring, short cry was to locate a mate, and call her to good\nfeeding. The sharp wild scream of a note was when a hawk passed over, a\nweasel lurked in the thicket, or a black snake sunned on the bushes. She\nremembered these things, and lay listening intently, trying to interpret\nevery sound as the Harvester did.\n\nBirds of wide wing hung as if nailed to the sky, or wheeled and sailed\nin grandeur. They were searching the landscape below to locate a hare\nor snake in the waving grass or carrion in the fields. The wonderful\nexhibitions of wing power were their expression of exultation in life,\njust as the song sparrow threatened to rupture his throat as he swung\non the hedge, and the red bird somewhere in the thicket whistled so\nforcefully it sounded as if the notes might hurt him.\n\nOn the lake bass splashed in a game with each other. Grebes chattered,\nbecause they were very social. Ducks dived and gobbled for roots and\nworms of the lake shore, and congratulated each other when they were\nlucky.\n\nKilldeer cried for slaughter, in plaintive tones, as their white breasts\ngleamed silver-like across the sky. They insisted on the death of their\nancient enemies, because the deer had trampled nests around the\nshore, roiled the water, spoiled the food hunting, and had been wholly\nunmindful of the laws of feathered folk from the beginning.\n\nBehind the barn imperial cocks crowed challenges of defiance to each\nother and all the world, because they once had worn royal turbans on\ntheir heads, and ruled the forests, even the elephants and lions. Happy\nhens cackled when they deposited an egg, and wandered through their park\nsinging the spring egg song unceasingly.\n\nUpon the barn Ajax spread and exulted in glittering plumage, and\nscreamed viciously. He was sending a wireless plea to the forests of\nCeylon for a gray mate to come and share the ridge pole with him, and\nhelp him wage red war on the sickening love making of the white doves he\nhated.\n\nEverything was beautiful, some of it was amusing, all instructive, and\nintensely interesting. The Girl wanted to know about the brown, yellow,\nand black butterflies sailing from flower to flower. She watched big\nblack and gold bees come from the forest for pollen and listened to\ntheir monotonous bumbling. Her first humming bird poised in air, and\nsipped nectar before her astonished eyes. It was marvellous, but more\nwonderful to the Girl than anything she saw or heard was the fact that\nbecause of the Harvester's teachings she now could trace through all of\nit the ordained processes of the evolution of life. Everything was right\nin its way, all necessary to human welfare, and so there was nothing to\nfear, but marvels to learn and pictures to appreciate. She would have\ntaken Belshazzar and gone out, but the Harvester had exacted a promise\nthat she would not. The fact was, he could see that she was coming\ngradually to a sane and natural view of life and living things, and he\ndid not want some sound or creature to frighten her, and spoil what he\nhad accomplished. So she swayed in the swing and watched, and tried to\ninterpret sights and sounds as he did.\n\nBefore an hour she realized that she was coming speedily into sympathy\nwith the wild life around her; for, instead of shivering and shrinking\nat unaccustomed sounds, she was listening especially for them, and\ntrying to arrive at a sane version. Instead of the senseless roar\nof commerce, manufacture, and life of a city, she was beginning to\nappreciate sounds that varied and carried the Song of Life in unceasing\nmeasure and absorbing meaning, while she was more than thankful for the\nfresh, pure air, and the blessed, God-given light. It seemed to the Girl\nthat there was enough sunshine at Medicine Woods to furnish rays of gold\nfor the whole world.\n\n“Bel,” she said to the dog standing beside her, “it's a shame to\nseparate you from the Medicine Man and pen you here with me. It's a\nwonder you don't bite off my head and run away to find him. He's gone to\nbring more things to make life beautiful. I wanted to go with him, but\noh Bel, there's something dreadfully wrong with me. I was afraid I'd\nfall on the streets and frighten and shame him. I'm so weak, I scarcely\ncan walk straight across one of these big, cool rooms that he has built\nfor me. He can make everything beautiful, Bel, a home, rooms, clothing,\ngrounds, and life----above everything else he can make life beautiful.\nHe's so splendid and wonderful, with his wide understanding and sane\ninterpretation and God-like sympathy and patience. Why Belshazzar, he\ncan do the greatest thing in all the world! He can make you forget that\nthe grave annihilates your dear ones by hideous processes, and set you\nto thinking instead that they come back to you in whispering leaves and\nflower perfumes. If I didn't owe him so much that I ought to pay, if\nthis wasn't so alluringly beautiful, I'd like to go to the oak and lie\nbeside those dear women resting there, and give my tired body to\nfurnish sap for strength and leaves for music. He can take its bitterest\nsting----from death, Bel----and that's the most wonderful thing----in\nlife, Bel----”\n\nHer voice became silent, her eyes closed; the dog stretched himself\nbeside her on guard, and it was so the Harvester found them when he\ndrove home from the city. He heaped his load in the dining-room, stabled\nBetsy, carried the things he had brought where he thought they belonged,\nand prepared food. When she awakened she came to him.\n\n“How is it going, Girl?” asked the Harvester.\n\n“I can't tell you how lovely it has been!”\n\n“Do you really mean that your heart is warming a little to things here?”\n\n“Indeed I do! I can't tell you what a morning I've had. There have been\nsuch myriad things to see and hear. Oh, Harvester, can you ever teach me\nwhat all of it means?”\n\n“I can right now,” said the Harvester promptly. “It means two things,\nso simple any little child can understand----the love of God and the\nevolution of life. I am not precisely clear as to what I mean when I say\nGod. I don't know whether it is spirit, matter, or force; it is that big\nthing that brings forth worlds, establishes their orbits, and gives us\nheat, light, food, and water. To me, that is God and His love. Just that\nwe are given birth, sheltered, provisioned, and endowed for our work.\nEvolution is the natural consequence of this. It is the plan steadily\nunfolding. If I were you, I wouldn't bother my head over these\nquestions, they never have been scientifically explained to the\nbeginning; I doubt if they ever will be, because they start with the\norigin of matter and that is too far beyond man for him to penetrate.\nJust enjoy to the depths of your soul----that's worship. Be thankful for\neverything----that's praising God as the birds praise him. And 'do unto\nothers' that's all there is of love and religion combined in one fell\nswoop.”\n\n“You should go before the world and tell every one that!”\n\n“No! It isn't my vocation,” said the Harvester. “My work is to provide\npain-killer. I don't believe, Ruth, that there is any one on the\nfootstool who is doing a better job along that line. I am boastfully\nproud of it----just of sending in the packages that kill fever, refresh\npoor blood, and strengthen weak hearts; unadulterated, honest weight,\nfresh, and scrupulously clean. My neighbours have a different name for\nit; I call it a man's work.”\n\n“Every one who understands must,” said the Girl. “I wish I could help at\nthat. I feel as if it would do more to wipe out the pain I've suffered\nand seen her endure than anything else. Man, when I grow strong enough I\nwant to help you. I believe that I am going to love it here.”\n\n“Don't ever suppress your feelings, Ruth!” hastily cried the Harvester.\n“It will be very bad for you. You will become wrought up, and 'het up,'\nas Granny Moreland says, and it will make you very ill. When we drive\nthe fever from your blood, the ache from your bones, the poison of\nwrong conditions from your soul, and good, healthy, red corpuscles begin\npumping through your little heart like a windmill, you can stake your\nlife you're going to love it here. And the location and work are not\nall you're going to care for either, honey. Now just wait! That was not\n'nominated in the bond.' I'm allowed to talk. I never agreed not to SAY\nthings. What I promised was not to DO them. So as I said, honey, sit at\nthis table, and eat the food I've cooked; and by that time the furniture\nvan will be here, and the men will unload, and you shall reign on a\nthrone and tell me where and how.”\n\n“Oh if I were only stronger, David!”\n\n“You are!” said the Harvester. “You are much better than you were\nyesterday. You can talk, and that's all that's necessary. The rooms\nare ready for furniture. The men will carry it where you want it. A\ndecorator is coming to hang the curtains. By night we will be settled;\nyou can lie in the swing while I read to you a story so wonderful that\nthe wildest fairy tale you ever heard never touched it.”\n\n“What will it be, David?”\n\n“Eat all the red raspberries and cream, bread and butter, and drink all\nthe milk you can. There's blood, beefsteak, and bones in it. As I was\nsaying, you have come here a stranger to a strange land. The first thing\nis for you to understand and love the woods. Before you can do that you\nshould master the history of one tree; just the same as you must learn\nto know and love me before your childlike trust in all mankind returns\nagain. Understand? Well, the fates knew you were on the way, coming\ntrembling down the brink, Ruth, so they put it into the heart of a great\nman to write largely of a wonderful tree, especially for your benefit.\nAfter it had fallen he took it apart, split it in sections, and year\nby year spread out history for all the world to read. It made a classic\nstory filled with unsurpassed wonders. It was a pine of a thousand\nyears, close the age of our mother tree, Ruth, and when we have learned\nfrom Enos Mills how to wrest secrets from the hearts of centuries, we\nwill climb the hill and measure our oak, and then I will estimate, and\nyou will write, and we will make a record for our tree.”\n\n“Oh, I'd like that!”\n\n“So would I,” said the Harvester. “And a million other things I can\nthink of that we can learn together. It won't require long for me to\nteach you all I know, and by that time your hand will be clasped in\nmine, and our 'hearts will beat as one,' and you will give me a kiss\nevery night and morning, and a few during the day for interest, and we\nwill go on in life together and learn songs, miracles, and wonders until\nthe old oak calls us. Then we will ascend the hill gladly and lie down\nand offer up our bodies, and our children will lay flowers over our\nhearts, and gather the herbs and paint the pictures? Amen. I hear a van\non the bridge. Just you go to your room and lie down until I get things\nunloaded and where they belong. Then you and the decorator can make us\nhome-like, and to-morrow we will begin to live. Won't that be great,\nRuth?”\n\n“With you, yes, I think it will.”\n\n“That will do for this time,” said the Harvester, as he opened the door\nto her room. “Lie and rest until I say ready.”\n\nAs he went to meet the men, she could hear him singing lustily, “Praise\nGod from whom all blessings flow.”\n\n“What a child he is!” she said. “And what a man!”\n\nFor an hour heavy feet sounded through the cabin carrying furniture to\ndifferent rooms. Then with a floor brush in one hand, and a polishing\ncloth in the other, the Harvester tapped at her door and helped the Girl\nupstairs. He had divided the space into three large, square sleeping\nchambers. In each he had set up a white iron bed, a dressing table, and\nwash stand, and placed two straight-backed and one rocking chair, all\nwhite. The walls were tinted lightly with green added to the plaster.\nThere was a mattress and a stack of bedding on each bed, and a large rug\nand several small ones on the floors. He led her to the rocking chair in\nthe middle room, where she could see through the open doors of the other\ntwo.\n\n“Now,” said the Harvester, “I didn't know whether the room with two\nwindows toward the lake and one on the marsh, or two facing the woods\nand one front, was the guest chamber. It seemed about an even throw\nwhether a visitor would prefer woods or water, so I made them both guest\nchambers, and got things alike for them. Now if we are entertaining two,\none can't feel more highly honoured than the other. Was that a scheme?”\n\n“Fine!” said the Girl. “I don't see how it could be surpassed.”\n\n“'Be sure you are right, then go ahead,'” quoted the Harvester. “Now\nI'll make the beds and Mr. Rogers can hang the curtains. Is white\ncorrect for sleeping rooms? Won't that wash best and always be fresh?”\n\n“It will,” said the Girl. “White wash curtains are much the nicest.”\n\n“Make them short Mr. Rogers; keep them off the floor,” advised the\nHarvester. “And simple----don't arrange any thing elaborate that will\ntire a woman to keep in order. Whack them off the right length and pin\nthem to the poles.”\n\n“How about that, Mrs. Langston?” asked the decorator.\n\n“I am quite sure that is the very best thing to do,” said the Girl; and\nthe curtains were hung while the mattress was placed.\n\n“Now about this?” inquired the Harvester. “Do I put on sheets and fix\nthese beds ready to use?”\n\n“I would not,” said the Girl. “I would spread the pad and the\ncounterpane and lay the sheets and pillows in the closet until they are\nwanted. They can be sunned and the bed made delightfully fresh.”\n\n“Of course,” said the Harvester.\n\nWhen he had finished, he spread a cover on the dressing table and\nlaid out white toilet articles and grouped a white wash set with green\ndecorations on the stand. Then he brushed the floor, spread a big green\nrug in the middle and small ones before the bed, stand, and table, and\ncoming out closed the door.\n\n“Guest chamber with lake view is now ready for company,” announced the\nHarvester. “Repeat the operation on the woods room, finished also. Why\ndo some people make work of things and string them out eternally and\nfuss so much? Isn't this simple and easy, Ruth?”\n\n“Yes, if you can afford it,” said the Girl.\n\n“Forbear!” cried the Harvester. “We have the goods, the dealer has my\ncheck. Excuse me ten minutes, until I furnish another room.”\n\nThe laughing Girl could catch glimpses of him busy over beds and\ndresser, floor and rugs; then he came where she sat.\n\n“Woods guest chamber ready,” he said. “Now we come to the interior\napartment, that from its view might be called the marsh room. Aside\nfrom being two windows short, it is exactly similar to the others. It\noccurred to me that, in order to make up for the loss of those windows,\nand also because I may be compelled to ask some obliging woman to occupy\nit in case your health is precarious at any time, and in view of the\nfurther fact that if any such woman could be found, and would kindly and\nwillingly care for us, my gratitude would be inexpressible; on account\nof all these things, I got a shade the BEST furnishings for this room.”\n\nThe Girl stared at him with blank face.\n\n“You see,” said the Harvester, “this is a question of ethics. Now what\nis a guest? A thing of a day! A person who disturbs your routine and\ninterferes with important concerns. Why should any one be grateful for\ncompany? Why should time and money be lavished on visitors? They come.\nYou overwork yourself. They go. You are glad of it. You return the\nvisit, because it's the only way to have back at them; but why pamper\nthem unnecessarily? Now a good housekeeper, that means more than words\ncan express. Comfort, kindness, sanitary living, care in illness! Here's\nto the prospective housekeeper of Medicine Woods! Rogers, hang those\nruffled embroidered curtains. Observe that whereas mere guest beds\nare plain white, this has a touch of brass. Where guest rugs are floor\ncoverings, this is a work of art. Where guest brushes are celluloid,\nthese are enamelled, and the dresser cover is hand embroidered. Let me\nalso call your attention to the chairs touched with gold, cushioned\nfor ease, and a decorated pitcher and bowl. Watch the bounce of these\nsprings and the thickness of this mattress and pad, and notice that\nwhere guests, however welcome, get a down cover of sateen, the lady of\nthe house has silkaline. Won't she prepare us a breakfast after a night\nin this room?”\n\n“David, are you in earnest?” gasped the Girl.\n\n“Don't these things prove it?” asked the Harvester. “No woman can enter\nmy home, when my necessities are so great I have to hire her to come,\nand take the WORST in the house. After my wife, she gets the best, every\ntime. Whenever I need help, the woman who will come and serve me is what\nI'd call the real guest of the house. Friend? Where are your friends\nwhen trouble comes? It always brings a crowd on account of the\nexcitement, and there is noise and racing; but if your soul is saved\nalive, it is by a steady, trained hand you pay to help you. Friends\ncome and go, but a good housekeeper remains and is a business\nproposition--one that if conducted rightly for both parties and on a\nstrictly common-sense basis, gives you living comfort. Now that we have\ndisposed of the guests that go and the one that remains, we will proceed\ndownward and arrange for ourselves.”\n\n“David, did you ever know any one who treated a housekeeper as you say\nyou would?”\n\n“No. And I never knew any one who raised medicinal stuff for a living,\nbut I'm making a gilt-edged success of it, and I would of a housekeeper,\ntoo.”\n\n“It doesn't seem----”\n\n“That's the bedrock of all the trouble on the earth,” interrupted the\nHarvester. “We are a nation and a part of a world that spends our time\non 'seeming.' Our whole outer crust is 'seeming.' When we get beneath\nthe surface and strike the BEING, then we live as we are privileged by\nthe Almighty. I don't think I give a tinker how anything SEEMS. What\nconcerns me is how it IS. It doesn't 'seem' possible to you to hire a\nwoman to come into your home and take charge of its cleanliness and the\nfood you eat--the very foundation of life--and treat her as an honoured\nguest, and give her the best comfort you have to offer. The cold room,\nthe old covers, the bare floor, and the cast off furniture are for her.\nNo wonder, as a rule, she gives what she gets. She dignifies her labour\nin the same ratio that you do. Wait until we need a housekeeper, and\nthen gaze with awe on the one I will raise to your hand.”\n\n“I wonder----”\n\n“Don't! It's wearing! Come tell me how to make our living-room less bare\nthan it appears at present.”\n\nThey went downstairs together, followed by the decorator, and began work\non the room. The Girl was placed on a couch and made comfortable and\nthen the Harvester looked around.\n\n“That bundle there, Rogers, is the curtains we bought for this room. If\nyou and my wife think they are not right, we will not hang them.”\n\nThe decorator opened the package and took out curtains of tan-coloured\ngoods with a border of blue and brown.\n\n“Those are not expensive,” said the Harvester, “but to me a window\nappears bare with only a shade, so I thought we'd try these, and when\nthey become soiled we'll burn them and buy some fresh ones.”\n\n“Good idea!” laughed the Girl. “As a house decorator you surpass\nyourself as a Medicine Man.”\n\n“Fix these as you did those upstairs,” ordered the Harvester. “We don't\nwant any fol-de-rols. Put the bottom even with the sill and shear them\noff at the top.”\n\n“No, I am going to arrange these,” said the decorator, “you go on with\nyour part.”\n\n“All right!” agreed the Harvester. “First, I'll lay the big rug.”\n\nHe cleared the floor, spread a large rug with a rich brown centre and a\nwide blue border. Smaller ones of similar design and colour were placed\nbefore each of the doors leading from the room.\n\n“Now for the hearth,” said the Harvester, “I got this tan goat skin.\nDoesn't that look fairly well?”\n\nIt certainly did; and the Girl and the decorator hastened to say so. The\nHarvester replaced the table and chairs, and then sat on the couch at\nthe Girl's feet.\n\n“I call this almost finished,” he remarked. “All we need now is a\nbouquet and something on the walls, and that is serious business.\nWhat goes on them usually remains for a long time, and so it should be\nselected with care. Ruth, have you a picture of your mother?”\n\n“None since she was my mother. I have some lovely girl photographs.”\n\n“Good!” cried the Harvester. “Exactly the thing! I have a picture of my\nmother when she was a pretty girl. We will select the best of yours and\nhave them enlarged in those beautiful brown prints they make in these\ndays, and we'll frame one for each side of the mantel. After that you\ncan decorate the other walls as you see things you want. Fifteen minutes\ngone; we are ready to take up the line of march to the dining-room. Oh\nI forgot my pillows! Here are a half dozen tan, brown, and blue for this\nroom. Ruth, you arrange them.”\n\nThe Girl heaped four on the couch, stood one beside the hearth, and laid\nanother in a big chair.\n\n“Now I don't know what you will think of this,” said the Harvester. “I\nfound it in a magazine at the library. I copied this whole room. The\nplan was to have the floor, furniture, and casings of golden oak and the\nwalls pale green. Then it said get yellow curtains bordered with green\nand a green rug with yellow figures, so I got them. I had green leather\ncushions made for the window seats, and these pillows go on them. Hang\nthe saffron curtains, Rogers, and we will finish in good shape for\ndinner by six. By the way, Ruth, when will you select your dishes? It\nwill take a big set to fill all these shelves and you shall have exactly\nwhat you want.”\n\n“I can use those you have very well.”\n\n“Oh no you can't!” cried the Harvester. “I may live and work in the\nwoods, but I am not so benighted that I don't own and read the best\nbooks and magazines, and subscribe for a few papers. I patronize the\nlibrary and see what is in the stores. My money will buy just as much as\nany man's, if I do wear khaki trousers. Kindly notice the word. Save in\ndeference to your ladyship I probably would have said pants. You see how\nELITE I can be if I try. And it not only extends to my wardrobe, to a\n'yaller' and green dining-room, but it takes in the 'chany' as well. I\nhave looked up that, too. You want china, cut glass, silver cutlery, and\nlinen. Ye! Ye! You needn't think I don't know anything but how to dig in\nthe dirt. I have been studying this especially, and I know exactly what\nto get.”\n\n“Come here,” said the Girl, making a place for him beside her. “Now let\nme tell you what I think. We are going to live in the woods, and our\nhome is a log cabin----”\n\n“With acetylene lights, a furnace, baths, and hot and cold water----”\n interpolated the Harvester.\n\nThe Girl and the decorator laughed.\n\n“Anyway,” said she, “if you are going to let me have what I would like,\nI'd prefer a set of tulip yellow dishes with the Dutch little figures\non them. I don't know what they cost, but certainly they are not so\nexpensive as cut glass and china.”\n\n“Is that earnest or is it because you think I am spending too much\nmoney?”\n\n“It is what I want. Everything else is different; why should we have\ndishes like city folk? I'd dearly love to have the Dutch ones, and\na white cloth with a yellow border, glass where it is necessary, and\nsilver knives, forks, and spoons.”\n\n“That would be great, all right!” endorsed the decorator. “And you have\ngot a priceless old lustre tea set there, and your willow ware is as\nfine as I ever saw. If I were you, I wouldn't buy a dish with what you\nhave, except the yellow set.”\n\n“Great day!” ejaculated the Harvester. “Will you tell me why my great\ngrandmother's old pink and green teapot is priceless?”\n\nThe Girl explained pink lustre. “That set in the shop I knew in Chicago\nwould sell for from three to five hundred dollars. Truly it would! I've\nseen one little pink and green pitcher like yours bring nine dollars\nthere. And you've not only got the full tea set, but water and dip\npitchers, two bowls, and two bread plates. They are priceless, because\nthe secret of making them is lost; they take on beauty with age, and\nthey were your great-grandmother's.”\n\nThe Harvester reached over and energetically shook hands.\n\n“Ruth, I'm so glad you've got them!” he bubbled. “Now elucidate on my\nwillow ware. What is it? Where is it? Why have I willow ware and am not\ninformed. Who is responsible for this? Did my ancestors buy better than\nthey knew, or worse? Is willow ware a crime for which I must hide\nmy head, or is it further riches thrust upon me? I thought I had\ninvestigated the subject of proper dishes quite thoroughly; but I am\nvery certain I saw no mention of lustre or willow. I thought, in my\nignorance, that lustre was a dress, and willow a tree. Have I been\ndeceived? Why is a blue plate or pitcher willow ware?”\n\n“Bring that platter from the mantel,” ordered the Girl, “and I will show\nyou.”\n\nThe Harvester obeyed and followed the finger that traced the design.\n\n“That's a healthy willow tree!” he commented. “If Loon Lake couldn't go\nahead of that it should be drained. And will you please tell me why this\nprecious platter from which I have eaten much stewed chicken, fried ham,\nand in youthful days sopped the gravy----will you tell me why this relic\nof my ancestors is called a willow plate, when there are a majority of\norange trees so extremely fruitful they have neglected to grow a leaf?\nWhy is it not an orange plate? Look at that boat! And in plain sight of\nit, two pagodas, a summer house, a water-sweep, and a pair of corpulent\nswallows; you would have me believe that a couple are eloping in broad\ndaylight.”\n\n“Perhaps it's night! And those birds are doves.”\n\n“Never!” cried the Harvester. “There is a total absence of shadows.\nThere is no moon. Each orange tree is conveniently split in halves, so\nyou can see to count the fruit accurately; the birds are in flight. Only\na swallow or a stork can fly in decorations, either by day or by night.\nAnd for any sake look at that elopement! He goes ahead carrying a cane,\nshe comes behind lugging the baggage, another man with a cane brings up\nthe rear. They are not running away. They have been married ten years\nat least. In a proper elopement, they forget there are such things\nas jewels and they always carry each other. I've often looked up the\nstatistics and it's the only authorized version. As I regard this\ntreasure, I grow faint when I remember with what unnecessary force my\nfather bore down when he carved the ham. I'll bet a cooky he split those\norange trees. Now me----I'll never dare touch knife to it again. I'll\nalways carve the meat on the broiler, and gently lift it to this\nplatter with a fork. Or am I not to be allowed to dine from my ancestral\ntreasure again?”\n\n“Not in a green and yellow room,” laughed the Girl. “I'll tell you what\nI think. If I had a tea table to match the living-room furniture, and\nit sat beside the hearth, and on it a chafing dish to cook in, and the\nwillow ware to eat from, we could have little tea parties in there, when\nwe aren't very hungry or to treat a visitor. It would help make that\nroom 'homey,' and it's wonderful how they harmonize with the other\nthings.”\n\n“How much willow ware have I got to 'bestow' on you?” inquired the\nHarvester. “Suppose you show me all of it. A guilty feeling arises in my\nbreast, and I fear me I have committed high crimes!”\n\n“Oh Man! You didn't break or lose any of those dishes, did you?”\n\n“Show me!” insisted the Harvester.\n\nThe Girl arose and going to the cupboard he had designed for her china\nshe opened it, and set before him a teapot, cream pitcher, two plates, a\nbowl, a pitcher, the meat platter, and a sugar bowl. “If there were all\nof the cups, saucers, and plates, I know where they would bring five\nhundred dollars,” she said.\n\n“Ruth, are you getting even with me for poking fun at them, or are you\nin earnest?” asked the Harvester.\n\n“I mean every word of it.”\n\n“You really want a small, black walnut table made especially for those\nold dishes?”\n\n“Not if you are too busy. I could use it with beautiful effect and much\npleasure, and I can't tell you how proud I'd be of them.”\n\nThe Harvester's face flushed. “Excuse me,” he said rising. “I have now\nfinished furnishing a house; I will go and take a peep at the engine.”\n He went into the kitchen and hearing the rattle of dishes the Girl\nfollowed. She stepped in just in time to see him hastily slide something\ninto his pocket. He picked up a half dozen old white plates and saucers\nand several cups and started toward the evaporator. He heard her coming.\n\n“Look here, honey,” he said turning, “you don't want to see the\ndry-house just now. I have terrific heat to do some rapid work. I won't\nbe gone but a few minutes. You better boss the decorator.\n\n“I'm afraid that wasn't very diplomatic,” he muttered. “It savoured a\nlittle of being sent back. But if what she says is right, and she\nshould know if they handle such stuff at that art store, she will feel\nconsiderably better not to see this.”\n\nHe set his load at the door, drew an old blue saucer from his pocket and\nmade a careful examination. He pulled some leaves from a bush and pushed\na greasy cloth out of the saucer, wiped it the best he could, and held\nit to light.\n\n“That is a crime!” he commented. “Saucer from your maternal ancestors'\ntea set used for a grease dish. I am afraid I'd better sink it in the\nlake. She'd feel worse to see it than never to know. Wish I could clean\noff the grease! I could do better if it was hot. I can set it on the\nengine.”\n\nThe Harvester placed the saucer on the engine, entered the dry-house,\nand closed the door. In the stifling air he began pouring seed from\nbeautiful, big willow plates to the old white ones.\n\n“About the time I have ruined you,” he said to a white plate, “some one\nwill pop up and discover that the art of making you is lost and you are\npriceless, and I'll have been guilty of another blunder. Now there are\nthe dishes mother got with baking powder. She thought they were grand.\nI know plenty well she prized them more than these blue ones or she\nwouldn't have saved them and used these for every day. There they set,\nall so carefully taken care of, and the Girl doesn't even look at them.\nThank Heaven, there are the four remaining plates all right, anyway! Now\nI've got seed in some of the saucers; one is there; where on earth is\nthe last one? And where, oh unkind fates! are the cups?”\n\nHe found more saucers and set them with the plates. As he passed the\nengine he noticed the saucer on it was bubbling grease, literally\nexuding it from the particles of clay.\n\n“Hooray!” cried the Harvester. He took it up, but it was so hot he\ndropped it. With a deft sweep he caught it in air, and shoved it on\na tray. Then he danced and blew on his burned hand. Snatching out his\nhandkerchief he rubbed off all the grease, and imagined the saucer was\nbrighter.\n\n“If 'a little is good, more is better,'” quoted the Harvester.\n\nWadding the handkerchief he returned the saucer to the engine. Then he\nslipped out, dripping perspiration, glanced toward the cabin, and ran\ninto the work room. The first object he saw was a willow cup half full\nof red paint, stuck and dried as if to remain forever. He took his knife\nand tried to whittle it off, but noticing that he was scratching the cup\nhe filled it with turpentine, set it under a work bench, turned a tin\npan over it, and covered it with shavings. A few steps farther brought\none in sight, filled with carpet tacks. He searched everywhere, but\ncould find no more, so he went to the laboratory. Beside his wash bowl\nat the door stood the last willow saucer. He had used it for years as a\nsoap dish. He scraped the contents on the bench and filled the dish with\nwater. Four cups held medicinal seeds and were in good condition. He\nlacked one, although he could not remember of ever having broken it.\nGathering his collection, he returned to the dry-house to see how the\nsaucer was coming on. Again it was bubbling, and he polished off the\ngrease and set back the dish. It certainly was growing better. He\ncarried his treasures into the work room, and went to the barn to\nfeed. As he was leaving the stable he uttered a joyous exclamation\nand snatched from a window sill a willow cup, gummed and smeared with\nharness oil.\n\n“The full set, by hokey!” marvelled the Harvester. “Say, Betsy, the only\nname for this is luck! Now if I only can clean them, I'll be ready to\nmake her tea table, whatever that is. My I hope she will stay away until\nI get these in better shape!”\n\nHe filled the last cup with turpentine, set it with the other under the\nwork bench, stacked the remaining pieces, polished the saucer he was\nbaking, and went to bring a dish pan and towel. He drew some water from\nthe pipes of the evaporator, put in the soap, and carried it to the work\nroom. There he carefully washed and wiped all the pieces, save two cups\nand one saucer. He did not know how long it would require to bake the\ngrease from that, but he was sure it was improving. He thought he could\nclean the paint cup, but he imagined the harness oil one would require\nbaking also.\n\nAs he stood busily working over the dishes, with light step the Girl\ncame to the door. She took one long look and understood. She turned\nand swiftly went back to the cabin, but her shoulders were shaking.\nPresently the Harvester came in and explained that after finishing in\nthe dry-house he had gone to do the feeding. Then he suggested that\nbefore it grew dark they should go through the rooms and see how they\nappeared, and gather the flowers the Girl wanted. So together they\ndecided everything was clean, comfortable, and harmonized.\n\nThen they went to the hillside sloping to the lake. For the dining-room,\nthe Girl wanted yellow water lilies, so the Harvester brought his old\nboat and gathered enough to fill the green bowl. For the living-room,\nshe used wild ragged robins in the blue bowl, and on one end of the\nmantel set a pitcher of saffron and on the other arrowhead lilies. For\nher room, she selected big, blushy mallows that grew all along Singing\nWater and around the lake.\n\n“Isn't that slightly peculiar?” questioned the Harvester.\n\n“Take a peep,” said the Girl, opening her door.\n\nShe had spread the pink coverlet on her couch, and when she set the big\npink bowl filled with mallows on the table the effect was exquisite.\n\n“I think perhaps that's a little Frenchy,” she said, “and you may have\nto be educated to it; but salmon pink and buttercup yellow are colours I\nlove in combination.”\n\nShe closed the door and went to find something to eat, and then to\nthe swing, where she liked to rest, look, and listen. The Harvester\nsuggested reading to her, but she shook her head.\n\n“Wait until winter,” she said, “when the days are longer and cold, and\nthe snow buries everything, and then read. Now tell me about my hedge\nand the things you have planted in it.”\n\nThe Harvester went out and collected a bunch of twigs. He handed her a\nbig, evenly proportioned leaf of ovate shape, and explained: “This is\nburning bush, so called because it has pink berries that hang from long,\ngraceful stems all winter, and when fully open they expose a flame-red\nseed pod. It was for this colour on gray and white days that I planted\nit. In the woods I grow it in thickets. The root bark brings twenty\ncents a pound, at the very least. It is good fever medicine.”\n\n“Is it poison?”\n\n“No. I didn't set anything acutely poisonous in your hedge. I wanted it\nto be a mass of bloom you were free to cut for the cabin all spring, an\nattraction to birds in summer, and bright with colour in winter. To draw\nthe feathered tribe, I planted alder, wild cherry, and grape-vines.\nThis is cherry. The bark is almost as beautiful as birch. I raise it\nfor tonics and the birds love the cherries. This fern-like leaf is from\nmountain ash, and when it attains a few years' growth it will flame with\ncolour all winter in big clusters of scarlet berries. That I grow in\nthe woods is a picture in snow time, and the bark is one of my standard\narticles.”\n\nThe Girl raised on her elbow and looked at the hedge.\n\n“I see it,” she said. “The berries are green now. I suppose they change\ncolour as they ripen.”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester. “And you must not confuse them with sumac.\nThe leaves are somewhat similar, but the heads differ in colour and\nshape. The sumac and buckeye you must not touch, until we learn what\nthey will do to you. To some they are slightly poisonous, to others not.\nI couldn't help putting in a few buckeyes on account of the big buds\nin early spring. You will like the colour if you are fond of pink and\nyellow in combination, and the red-brown nuts in grayish-yellow, prickly\nhulls, and the leaf clusters are beautiful, but you must use care. I put\nin witch hazel for variety, and I like its appearance; it's mighty\ngood medicine, too; so is spice brush, and it has leaves that colour\nbrightly, and red berries. These selections were all made for a purpose.\nNow here is wafer ash; it is for music as well as medicine. I have\ninvoked all good fairies to come and dwell in this hedge, and so I had\nto provide an orchestra for their dances. This tree grows a hundred tiny\ncastanets in a bunch, and when they ripen and become dry the wind shakes\nfine music from them. Yes, they are medicine; that is, the bark of\nthe roots is. Almost without exception everything here has medicinal\nproperties. The tulip poplar will bear you the loveliest flowers of all,\nand its root bark, taken in winter, makes a good fever remedy.”\n\n“How would it do to eat some of the leaves and see if they wouldn't take\nthe feverishness from me?”\n\n“It wouldn't do at all,” said the Harvester. “We are well enough fixed\nto allow Doc to come now, and he is the one to allay the fever.”\n\n“Oh no!” she cried. “No! I don't want to see a doctor. I will be all\nright very soon. You said I was better.”\n\n“You are,” said the Harvester. “Much better! We will have you strong and\nwell soon. You should have come in time for a dose of sassafras. Your\nhedge is filled with that, because of its peculiar leaves and odour. I\nput in dogwood for the white display around the little green bloom,\nlots of alder for bloom and berries, haws for blossoms and fruit for the\nsquirrels, wild crab apples for the exquisite bloom and perfume, button\nbush for the buttons, a few pokeberry plants for the colour, and I tried\nsome mallows, but I doubt if it's wet enough for them. I set pecks of\nvine roots, that are coming nicely, and ferns along the front edge. Give\nit two years and that hedge will make a picture that will do your eyes\ngood.”\n\n“Can you think of anything at all you forgot?”\n\n“Yes indeed!” said the Harvester. “The woods are full of trees I have\nnot used; some because I overlooked them, some I didn't want. A hedge\nlike this, in perfection, is the work of years. Some species must be cut\nback, some encouraged, but soon it will be lovely, and its colour and\nfruit attract every bird of the heavens and butterflies and insects of\nall varieties. I set several common cherry trees for the robins and some\nblackberry and raspberry vines for the orioles. The bloom is pretty and\nthe birds you'll have will be a treat to see and hear, if we keep away\ncats, don't fire guns, scatter food, and move quietly among them. With\nour water attractions added, there is nothing impossible in the way of\nmaking friends with feathered folk.”\n\n“There is one thing I don't understand,” said the Girl. “You wouldn't\nrisk breaking the wing of a moth by keeping it when you wanted a drawing\nvery much; you don't seem to kill birds and animals that other people\ndo. You almost worship a tree; now how can you take a knife and peel the\nbark to sell or dig up beautiful bushes by the root.”\n\n“Perhaps I've talked too much about the woods,” said the Harvester\ngently. “I've longed inexpressibly for sympathetic company here, because\nI feel rooted for life, so I am more than anxious that you should care\nfor it. I may have made you feel that my greatest interest is in the\nwoods, and that I am not consistent when I call on my trees and plants\nto yield of their store for my purposes. Above everything else, the\nhuman proposition comes first, Ruth. I do love my trees, bushes, and\nflowers, because they keep me at the fountain of life, and teach me\nlessons no book ever hints at; but above everything come my fellow men.\nAll I do is for them. My heart is filled with feeling for the things\nyou see around you here, but it would be joy to me to uproot the most\nbeautiful plant I have if by so doing I could save you pain. Other men\nhave wives they love as well, little children they have fathered, big\nbodies useful to the world, that are sometimes crippled with disease.\nThere is nothing I would not give to allay the pain of humanity. It is\nnot inconsistent to offer any growing thing you soon can replace, to\ncure suffering. Get that idea out of your head! You said you could\nworship at the shrine of the pokeberry bed, you feel holier before the\narrowhead lilies, your face takes on an appearance of reverence when you\nsee pink mallow blooms. Which of them would you have hesitated a second\nin uprooting if you could have offered it to subdue fever or pain in the\nbody of the little mother you loved?”\n\n“Oh I see!” cried the Girl. “Like everything else you make this\ndifferent. You worship all this beauty and grace, wrought by your\nhands, but you carry your treasure to the market place for the good of\nsuffering humanity. Oh Man! I love the work you do!”\n\n“Good!” cried the Harvester. “Good! And Ruth-girl, while you are about\nit, see if you can't combine the man and his occupation a little.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. GRANNY MORELAND'S VISIT\n\nThe following morning the Girl was awakened by wheels on the gravel\noutside her window, and lifted her head to see Betsy passing with a load\nof lumber. Shortly afterward the sound of hammer and saw came to her,\nand she knew that Singing Water bridge was being roofed to provide shade\nfor her. She dressed and went to the kitchen to find a dainty breakfast\nwaiting, so she ate what she could, and then washed the dishes and\nswept. By that time she was so tired she dropped on a dining-room window\nseat, and lay looking toward the bridge. She could catch glimpses of\nthe Harvester as he worked. She watched his deft ease in handling heavy\ntimbers, and the assurance with which he builded. Sometimes he stood and\nwith tilted head studied his work a minute, then swiftly proceeded. He\nplaced three tree trunks on each side for pillars, laid joists across,\nformed his angle, and nailed boards as a foundation for shingling.\nOccasionally he glanced toward the cabin, and finally came swinging up\nthe drive. He entered the kitchen softly, but when he saw the Girl in\nthe window he sat at her feet.\n\n“Oh but this is a morning, Ruth!” he said.\n\nShe looked at him closely. He radiated health and good cheer. His tanned\ncheeks were flushed red with exercise, and the hair on his temples was\ndamp.\n\n“You have been breaking the rules,” he said. “It is the law that I am\nto do the work until you are well and strong again. Why did you tire\nyourself?”\n\n“I am so perfectly useless! I see so many things that I would enjoy\ndoing. Oh you can do everything else, make me well! Make me strong!”\n\n“How can I, when you won't do as I tell you?”\n\n“I will! Indeed I will!”\n\n“Then no more attempts to stand over dishes and clean big floors. You\nmustn't overwork yourself at anything. The instant you feel in the least\ntired you must lie down and rest.”\n\n“But Man! I'm tired every minute, with a dead, dull ache, and I don't\nfeel as if I ever would be rested again in all the world.”\n\nThe Harvester took one of her hands, felt its fevered palm, fluttering\nwrist pulse, and noticed that the brilliant red of her lips had extended\nto spots on her cheeks. He formed his resolution.\n\n“Can't work on that bridge any more until I drive in for some big\nnails,” he said. “Do you mind being left alone for an hour?”\n\n“Not at all, if Bel will stay with me. I'll lie in the swing.”\n\n“All right!” answered the Harvester. “I'll help you out and to get\nsettled. Is there anything you want from town?”\n\n“No, not a thing!”\n\n“Oh but you are modest!” cried the Harvester. “I can sit here and name\nfifty things I want for you.”\n\n“Oh but you are extravagant!” imitated the Girl. “Please, please, Man,\ndon't! Can't you see I have so much now I don't know what to do with it?\nSometimes I almost forget the ache, just lying and looking at all the\nwonderful riches that have come to me so suddenly. I can't believe they\nwon't vanish as they came. By the hour in the night I look at my lovely\nroom, and I just fight my eyes to keep them from closing for fear\nthey'll open in that stifling garret to the heat of day and work I have\nnot strength to do. I know yet all this will prove to be a dream and a\nwilder one than yours.”\n\nThe face of the Harvester was very anxious.\n\n“Please to remember my dream came true,” he said, “and much sooner than\nI had the least hope that it would. I'm wide awake or I couldn't be\nbuilding bridges; and you are real, if I know flesh and blood when I\ntouch it.”\n\n“If I were well, strong, and attractive, I could understand,” she said.\n“Then I could work in the house, at the drawings, help with the herbs,\nand I'd feel as if I had some right to be here.”\n\n“All that is coming,” said the Harvester. “Take a little more time. You\ncan't expect to sin steadily against the laws of health for years,\nand recover in a day. You will be all right much sooner than you think\npossible.”\n\n“Oh I hope so!” said the Girl. “But sometimes I doubt it. How I could\ncome here and put such a burden on a stranger, I can't see. I scarcely\ncan remember what awful stress drove me. I had no courage. I should have\nfinished in my garret as my mother did. I must have some of my father's\ncoward blood in me. She never would have come. I never should!”\n\n“If it didn't make any real difference to you, and meant all the world\nto me, I don't see why you shouldn't humour me. I can't begin to tell\nyou how happy I am to have you here. I could shout and sing all day.”\n\n“It requires very little to make some people happy.”\n\n“You are not much, but you are going to be more soon,” laughed the\nHarvester, as he gently picked up the Girl and carried her to the swing,\nwhere he covered her, kissed her hot hand, and whistled for Belshazzar.\nHe pulled the table close and set a pitcher of iced fruit juice on it.\nThen he left her and she could hear the rattle of wheels as he crossed\nthe bridge and drove away.\n\n“Betsy, this is mighty serious business,” said the Harvester. “The\nGirl is scorching or I don't know fever. I wonder----well, one thing\nis sure----she is bound to be better off in pure, cool air and with\neverything I can do to be kind, than in Henry Jameson's attic with\neverything he could do to be mean. Pleasant men those Jamesons! Wonder\nif the Girl's father was much like her Uncle Henry? I think not or her\nrefined and lovely mother never would have married him. Come to think of\nit, that's no law, Betsy. I've seen beautiful and delicate women fall\nunder some mysterious spell, and yoke their lives with rank degenerates.\nWhatever he was, they have paid the price. Maybe the wife deserved it,\nand bore it in silence because she knew she did, but it's bitter hard on\nRuth. Girls should be taught to think at least one generation ahead when\nthey marry. I wonder what Doc will say, Betsy? He will have to come and\nsee for himself. I don't know how she will feel about that. I had hoped\nI could pull her through with care, food, and tonics, but I don't dare\ngo any farther alone. Betsy, that's a thin, hot, little hand to hold a\nman's only chance for happiness.”\n\n“Well, bridegroom! I've been counting the days!” said Doctor Carey. “The\nMissus and I made it up this morning that we had waited as long as we\nwould. We are coming to-night. David.”\n\n“It's all right, Doc,” said the Harvester. “Don't you dare think\nanything is wrong or that I am not the proudest, happiest man in this\nworld, because I appear anxious. I am not trying to conceal it from you.\nYou know we both agreed at first that Ruth should be in the hospital,\nDoc. Well, she should! She is what would be a lovely woman if she were\nnot full of the poison of wrong food and air, overwork, and social\nconditions that have warped her. She is all I dreamed of and more, but\nI've come for you. She is too sick for me. I hoped she would begin to\ngain strength at once on changed conditions. As yet I can't see any\ndifference. She needs a doctor, but I hate for her to know it. Could you\ncome out this afternoon, and pretend as if it were a visit? Bring Mrs.\nCarey and watch the Girl. If you need an examination, I think she will\nobey me. If you can avoid it, fix what she should have and send it back\nto me by a messenger. I don't like to leave her when she is so ill.”\n\n“I'll come at once, David.”\n\n“Then she will know that I came for you, and that will frighten her. You\ncan do more good to wait until afternoon, and pretend you are making\na social call. I must go now. I'd have brought her in, but I have no\nproper conveyance yet. I'm promised something soon, perhaps it is ready\nnow. Good-bye! Be sure to come!”\n\nThe Harvester drove to a livery barn and examined a little horse, a\nshining black creature that seemed gentle and spirited. He thought\nfavourably of it. A few days before he had selected a smart carriage,\nand with this outfit tied behind the wagon he returned to Medicine\nWoods. He left the horse at the bridge, stabled Betsy, and then returned\nfor the new conveyance, driving it to the hitching post. At the sound of\nunexpected wheels the Girl lifted her head and stared at the turnout.\n\n“Come on!” cried the Harvester opening the screen. “We are going to the\nwoods to initiate your carriage.”\n\nShe went with little cries of surprised wonder.\n\n“This is how you travel to Onabasha to do your shopping, to call on Mrs.\nCarey and the friends you will make, and visit the library. When I've\ntried out Mr. Horse enough to prove him reliable as guaranteed, he is\nyours, for your purposes only, and when you grow wonderfully well and\nstrong, we'll sell him and buy you a real live horse and a stanhope,\nsuch as city ladies have; and there must be a saddle so that you can\nride.”\n\n“Oh I'd love that!” cried the Girl. “I always wanted to ride! Where are\nwe going?”\n\n“To show you Medicine Woods,” said the Harvester. “I've been waiting\nfor this. You see there are several hundred acres of trees, thickets,\nshrubs, and herb beds up there, and if the wagon road that winds between\nthem were stretched straight it would be many miles in length, so we\nhave a cool, shaded, perfumed driveway all our own. Let me get you a\ndrink before you start and the little shawl. It's chilly there compared\nwith here. Now are you comfortable and ready?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Girl. “Hurry! I've just longed to go, but I didn't like\nto ask.”\n\n“I am sorry,” said the Harvester. “Living here for years alone and never\nhaving had a sister, how am I going to know what a girl would like if\nyou don't tell me? I knew it would be too tiresome for you to walk, and\nI was waiting to find a reliable horse and a suitable carriage.”\n\n“You won't scratch or spoil it up there?”\n\n“I'll lower the top. It is not as wide as the wagon, so nothing will\ntouch it.”\n\n“This is just so lovely, and such a wonderful treat, do you observe that\nI'm not saying a word about extravagance?” asked the Girl, as she leaned\nback in the carriage and inhaled the invigorating wood air.\n\nThe horse climbed the hill, and the Harvester guided him down long, dim\nroads through deep forest, while he explained what large thickets of\nbushes were, why he grew them, how he collected the roots or bark, for\nwhat each was used and its value. On and on they went, the way ahead\nalways appearing as if it were too narrow to pass, yet proving amply\nwide when reached. Excited redbirds darted among the bushes, and the\nHarvester answered their cry. Blackbirds protested against the unusual\nintrusion of strange objects, and a brown thrush slipped from a late\nnest close the road wailing in anxiety.\n\nOne after another the Harvester introduced the Girl to the best trees,\nspeculated on their age, previous history, and pointed out which brought\nlarge prices for lumber and which had medicinal bark and roots. On and\non they slowly drove through the woods, past the big beds of cranesbill,\nviolets, and lilies. He showed her where the mushrooms were most\nnumerous, and for the first time told the story of how he had sold them\nand the violets from door to door in Onabasha in his search for her, and\nthe amazed Girl sat staring at him. He told of Doctor Carey having seen\nher once, and inquired as they passed the bed if the yellow violets had\nrevived. He stopped to search and found a few late ones, deep among the\nleaves.\n\n“Oh if I only had known that!” cried the Girl, “I would have kept them\nforever.”\n\n“No need,” said the Harvester. “Here and now I present you with the sole\nownership of the entire white and yellow violet beds. Next spring you\nshall fill your room. Won't that be a treat?”\n\n“One money never could buy!” cried the Girl.\n\n“Seems to be my strong point,” commented the Harvester. “The most I have\nto offer worth while is something you can't buy. There is a fine fairy\nplatform. They can spare you one. I'll get it.”\n\nThe Harvester broke from a tree a large fan-shaped fungus, the surface\nsatin fine, the base mossy, and explained to the Girl that these were\nthe ballrooms of the woods, the floors on which the little people dance\nin the moonlight at their great celebrations. Then he added a piece\nof woolly dog moss, and showed her how each separate spine was like a\nperfect little evergreen tree.\n\n“That is where the fairies get their Christmas pines,” he explained.\n\n“Do you honestly believe in fairies?”\n\n“Surely!” exclaimed the Harvester. “Who would tell me when the maples\nare dripping sap, and the mushrooms springing up, if the fairies didn't\nwhisper in the night? Who paints the flower faces, colours the leaves,\nenamels the ripening fruit with bloom, and frosts the window pane to let\nme know that it is time to prepare for winter? Of course! They are my\nfriends and everyday helpers. And the winds are good to me. They carry\ndown news when tree bloom is out, when the pollen sifts gold from the\nbushes, and it's time to collect spring roots. The first bluebird always\nbrings me a message. Sometimes he comes by the middle of February, again\nnot until late March. Always on his day, Belshazzar decides my fate for\na year. Six years we've played that game; now it is ended in blessed\nreality. In the woods and at my work I remain until I die, with a few\noutside tries at medicine making. I am putting up some compounds in\nwhich I really have faith. Of course they have got to await their time\nto be tested, but I believe in them. I have grown stuff so carefully,\ngathered it according to rules, washed it decently, and dried and mixed\nit with such scrupulous care. Night after night I've sat over the books\nuntil midnight and later, studying combinations; and day after day I've\nstood in the laboratory testing and trying, and two or three will prove\neffective, or I've a disappointment coming.”\n\n“You haven't wasted time! I'd much rather take medicines you make than\nany at the pharmacies. Several times I've thought I'd ask you if you\nwouldn't give me some of yours. The prescription Doctor Carey sent does\nno good. I've almost drunk it, and I am constantly tired, just the\nsame. You make me something from these tonics and stimulants you've been\ntelling me about. Surely you can help me!”\n\n“I've got one combination that's going to save life, in my expectations.\nBut Ruth, it never has been tried, and I couldn't experiment on the very\nlight of my eyes with it. If I should give you something and you'd grow\nworse as a result--I am a strong man, my girl, but I couldn't endure\nthat. I'd never dare. But dear, I am expecting Carey and his wife out\nany time; probably they will come to-day, it's so beautiful; and when\nthey do, for my sake, won't you talk with him, tell him exactly what\nmade you ill, and take what he gives you? He's a great man. He was\nrecently President of the National Association of Surgeons. Long ago he\nabandoned general practice, but he will prescribe for you; all his art\nis at your command. It's quite an honour, Ruth. He performs all kinds\nof miracles, and saves life every day. He had not seen you, and what he\ngave me was only by guess. He may not think it is the right thing at all\nafter he meets you.”\n\n“Then I am really ill?”\n\n“No. You only have the germs of illness in your blood, and if you\nwill help me that much we can eliminate them; and then it is you for\nhousekeeper, with first assistant in me, the drawing tools, paint\nbox, and all the woods for subjects. So, as I was going to tell you,\nBelshazzar and I have played our game for the last time. That decision\nwas ultimate. Here I will work, live, and die. Here, please God,\nstrong and happy, you shall live with me. Ruth, you have got to recover\nquickly. You will consult the doctor?”\n\n“Yes, and I wish he would hurry,” said the Girl. “He can't make me new\ntoo soon to suit me. If I had a strong body, oh Man, I just feel as if\nyou could find a soul somewhere in it that would respond to all these\nwonders you have brought me among. Oh! make me well, and I'll try as\nwoman never did before to bring you happiness to pay for it.”\n\n“Careful now,” warned the Harvester. “There is to be no talk of\nobligations between you and me. Your presence here and your growing\ntrust in me are all I ask at the hands of fate at present. Long ago I\nlearned to 'labour and to wait.' By the way----here's my most difficult\nlabour and my longest wait. This is the precious gingseng bed.”\n\n“How pretty!” exclaimed the Girl.\n\nCovering acres of wood floor, among the big trees, stretched the lacy\ngreen carpet. On slender, upright stalks waved three large leaves, each\nmade up of five stemmed, ovate little leaves, round at the base, sharply\npointed at the tip. A cluster of from ten to twenty small green berries,\nthat would turn red later, arose above. The Harvester lifted a plant\nto show the Girl that the Chinese name, Jin-chen, meaning man-like,\noriginated because the divided root resembled legs. Away through the\nwoods stretched the big bed, the growth waving lightly in the wind, the\npeculiar odour filling the air.\n\n“I am going to wait to gather the crop until the seeds are ripe,” said\nthe Harvester, “then bury some as I dig a root. My father said that was\nthe way of the Indians. It's a mighty good plan. The seeds are delicate,\nand difficult to gather and preserve properly. Instead of collecting and\nselling all of them to start rivals in the business, I shall replant my\nbeds. I must find a half dozen assistants to harvest this crop in that\nway, and it will be difficult, because it will come when my neighbours\nare busy with corn.”\n\n“Maybe I can help you.”\n\n“Not with ginseng digging,” laughed the Harvester. “That is not woman's\nwork. You may sit in an especially attractive place and boss the job.”\n\n“Oh dear!” cried the Girl. “Oh dear! I want to get out and walk.”\n\nGradually they had climbed the summit of the hill, descended on the\nother side, and followed the road through the woods until they reached\nthe brier patches, fruit trees; and the garden of vegetables, with big\nbeds of sage, rue, wormwood, hoarhound, and boneset. From there to the\nlake sloped the sunny fields of mullein and catnip, and the earth was\nmolten gold with dandelion creeping everywhere.\n\n“Too hot to-day,” cautioned the Harvester. “Too rough walking. Wait\nuntil fall, and I have a treat there for you. Another flower I want you\nto love because I do.”\n\n“I will,” said the Girl promptly. “I feel it in my heart.”\n\n“Well I am glad you feel something besides the ache of fever,” said the\nHarvester. Then noticing her tired face he added: “Now this little horse\nhad quite a trip from town, and the wheels cut deeply into this woods\nsoil and make difficult pulling, so I wonder if I had not better put\nhim in the stable and let him become acquainted with Betsy. I don't know\nwhat she will think. She has had sole possession for years. Maybe she\nwill be jealous, perhaps she will be as delighted for company as her\nmaster. Ruth, if you could have heard what I said to Belshazzar when he\ndecided I was to go courting this year, and seen what I did to him, and\nthen take a look at me now----merciful powers, I hope the dog doesn't\nremember! If he does, no wonder he forms a new allegiance so easily.\nHave you observed that lately when I whistle, he starts, and then turns\nback to see if you want him? He thinks as much of you as he does of me\nright now.”\n\n“Oh no!” cried the Girl. “That couldn't be possible. You told me I must\nmake friends with him, so I have given him food, and tried to win him.”\n\n“You sit in the carriage until I put away the horse, and then I'll help\nyou to the cabin, and save you being alone while I work. Would you like\nthat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe leaned her head against the carriage top the Harvester had raised to\nscreen her, and watched him stable the horse. Evidently he was very fond\nof animals for he talked as if it were a child he was undressing and\nkept giving it extra strokes and pats as he led it away. Ajax disliked\nthe newcomer instantly, noticed the carriage and the woman's dress, and\nscreamed his ugliest. The Girl smiled. As the Harvester appeared she\ninquired, “Is Ajax now sending a wireless to Ceylon asking for a mate?”\n\nThe Harvester looked at her quizzically and saw a gleam of mischief in\nthe usually dull dark eyes that delighted him.\n\n“That is the customary supposition when he finds voice,” he said. “But\nsince this has become your home, you are bound to learn some of my\nsecrets. One of them I try to guard is the fact that Ajax has a temper.\nNo my dear, he is not always sending a wireless, I am sorry to say. I\nwish he was! As a matter of fact he is venting his displeasure at any\ndifference in our conditions. He hates change. He learned that from me.\nI will enjoy seeing him come for favour a year from now, as I learned\nto come for it, even when I didn't get much, and the road lay west of\nOnabasha. Ajax, stop that! There's no use to object. You know you think\nthat horse is nice company for you, and that two can feed you more than\none. Don't be a hypocrite! Cease crying things you don't mean, and learn\nto love the people I do. Come on, old boy!”\n\nThe peacock came, but with feathers closely pressed and stepping\ndaintily. As the bird advanced, the Harvester retreated, until he stood\nbeside the Girl, and then he slipped some grain to her hand and she\noffered it. But Ajax would not be coaxed. He was too fat and well fed.\nHe haughtily turned and marched away, screaming at intervals.\n\n“Nasty temper!” commented the Harvester. “Never mind! He soon will\nbecome accustomed to you, and then he will love you as Belshazzar does.\nFeed the doves instead. They are friendly enough in all conscience. Do\nyou notice that there is not a coloured feather among them? The squab\nthat is hatched with one you may have for breakfast. Now let's go find\nsomething to eat, and I will finish the bridge so you can rest there\nto-night and watch the sun set on Singing Water.”\n\nSo they went into the cabin and prepared food, and then the Harvester\ntold the Girl to make herself so pretty that she would be a picture and\ncome and talk to him while he finished the roof. She went to her room,\nfound a pale lavender linen dress and put it on, dusted the pink powder\nthickly, and went where a wide bench made an inviting place in the\nshade. There she sat and watched her lightly expressed whim take shape.\n\n“Soon as this is finished,” said the Harvester, “I am going to begin on\nthat tea table. I can make it in a little while, if you want it to match\nthe other furniture.”\n\n“I do,” said the Girl.\n\n“Wonder if you could draw a plan showing how it should appear. I am a\nlittle shy on tea tables.”\n\n“I think I can.”\n\nThe Harvester brought paper, pencil, and a shingle for a drawing pad.\n\n“Now remember one thing,” he said. “If you are in earnest about using\nthose old blue dishes, this has got to be a big, healthy table. A little\none will appear top heavy with them. It would be a good idea to set out\nwhat you want to use, arranged as you would like them, and let me take\nthe top measurement that way.”\n\n“All right! I'll only indicate how its legs should be and we will\nfind the size later. I could almost weep because that wonderful set is\nbroken. If I had all of it I'd be so proud!”\n\nThe Girl bent over the drawing. The Harvester worked with his attention\ndivided between her, the bridge, and the road. At last he saw the big\nred car creeping up the valley.\n\n“Seems to be some one coming, Ruth! Guess it must be Doc. I'll go open\nthe gate?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Girl. “I'm so glad. You won't forget to ask him to help\nme if he can?”\n\nThe Harvester wheeled hastily. “I won't forget!” he said, as he hurried\nto the gate. The car ran slowly, and the Girl could see him swing to\nthe step and stand talking as they advanced. When they reached her they\nstopped and all of them came forward. She went to meet them. She shook\nhands with Mrs. Carey and then with the doctor.\n\n“I am so glad you have come,” she said.\n\n“I hope you are not lonesome already,” laughed the doctor.\n\n“I don't think any one with brains to appreciate half of this ever could\nbecome lonely here,” answered the Girl. “No, it isn't that.”\n\n“A-ha!” cried the doctor, turning to his wife. “You see that the\nbeautiful young lady remembers me, and has been wishing I would come. I\nalways said you didn't half appreciate me. What a place you are making,\nDavid! I'll run the car to the shade and join you.”\n\nFor a long time they talked under the trees, then they went to see the\nnew home and all its furnishings.\n\n“Now this is what I call comfort,” said the doctor. “David, build us a\nhouse exactly similar to this over there on the hill, and let us live\nout here also. I'd love it. Would you, Clara?”\n\n“I don't know. I never lived in the country. One thing is sure: If I\ntried it, I'd prefer this to any other place I ever saw. David, won't\nyou take me far enough up the hill that I can look from the top to the\nlake?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Harvester. “Excuse us a little while, Ruth!”\n\nAs soon as they were gone the Girl turned to the doctor.\n\n“Doctor Carey, David says you are great. Won't you exercise your art on\nme. I am not at all well, and oh! I'd so love to be strong and sound.”\n\n“Will you tell me,” asked the doctor, “just enough to show me what\ncaused the trouble?”\n\n“Bad air and water, poor light and food at irregular times, overwork and\ndeep sorrow; every wrong condition of life you could imagine, with not a\nray of hope in the distance, until now. For the sake of the Harvester, I\nwould be well again. Please, please try to cure me!”\n\nSo they talked until the doctor thought he knew all he desired, and then\nthey went to see the gold flower garden.\n\n“I call this simply superb,” said he, taking a seat beneath the tree\nroof of her porch. “Young woman, I don't know what I'll do to you if you\ndon't speedily grow strong here. This is the prettiest place I ever saw,\nand listen to the music of that bubbling, gurgling little creek!”\n\n“Isn't he wonderful?” asked the Girl, looking up the hill, where the\ntall form of the Harvester could be seen moving around. “Just to see\nhim, you would think him the essence of manly strength and force. And\nhe is! So strong! Into the lake at all hours, at the dry-house, on the\nhill, grubbing roots, lifting big pillars to support a bridge roof,\nand with it all a fancy as delicate as any dreaming girl. Doctor, the\nfairies paint the flowers, colour the fruit, and frost the windows for\nhim; and the winds carry pollen to tell him when his growing things are\nready for the dry-house. I don't suppose I can tell you anything new\nabout him; but isn't he a perpetual surprise? Never like any one else!\nAnd no matter how he startles me in the beginning, he always ends by\nconvincing me, at least, that he is right.”\n\n“I never loved any other man as I do him,” said the doctor. “I ushered\nhim into the world when I was a young man just beginning to practise,\nand I've known him ever since. I know few men so scrupulously clean. Try\nto get well and make him happy, Mrs. Langston. He so deserves it.”\n\n“You may be sure I will,” answered the Girl.\n\nAfter the visitors had gone, the Harvester told her to place the old\nblue dishes as she would like to arrange them on her table, so he could\nget a correct idea of the size, and he left to put a few finishing\nstrokes on the bridge cover. She went into the dining-room and opened\nthe china closet. She knew from her peep in the work-room that there\nwould be more pieces than she had seen before; but she did not think\nor hope that a full half dozen tea set and plates, bowl, platter, and\npitcher would be waiting for her.\n\n“Why Ruth, what made you tire yourself to come down? I intended to\nreturn in a few minutes.”\n\n“Oh Man!” cried the laughing Girl, as she clung pantingly to a bridge\npillar for support, “I just had to come to tell you. There are fairies!\nReally truly ones! They have found the remainder of the willow dishes\nfor me, and now there are so many it isn't going to be a table at all.\nIt must be a little cupboard especially for them, in that space between\nthe mantel and the bookcase. There should be a shining brass tea\ncanister, and a wafer box like the arts people make, and I'll pour tea\nand tend the chafing dish and you can toast the bread with a long fork\nover the coals, and we will have suppers on the living-room table, and\nit will be such fun.”\n\n“Be seated!” cried the Harvester. “Ruth, that's the longest speech I\never heard you make, and it sounded, praise the Lord, like a girl. Did\nDoc say he would fix something for you?”\n\n“Yes, such a lot of things! I am going to shut my eyes and open my mouth\nand swallow all of them. I'm going to be born again and forget all I\never knew before I came here, and soon I will be tagging you everywhere,\nbegging you to suggest designs for my pencil, and I'll simply force life\nto come right for you.”\n\nThe Harvester smiled.\n\n“Sounds good!” he said. “But, Ruth, I'm a little dubious about force\nwork. Life won't come right for me unless you learn to love me, and\nlove is a stubborn, contrary bulldog element of our nature that won't\nbe driven an inch. It wanders as the wind, and strikes us as it will.\nYou'll arrive at what I hope for much sooner if you forget it and amuse\nyourself and be as happy as you can. Then, perhaps all unknown to you,\na little spark of tenderness for me will light in your breast; and if it\never does we will buy a fanning mill and put it in operation, and we'll\nraise a flame or know why.”\n\n“And there won't be any force in that?”\n\n“What you can't compel is the start. It's all right to push any growth\nafter you have something to work on.”\n\n“That reminds me,” said the Girl, “there is a question I want to ask\nyou.”\n\n“Go ahead!” said the Harvester, glancing at her as he hewed a joist.\n\nShe turned away her face and sat looking across the lake for a long\ntime.\n\n“Is it a difficult question, Ruth?” inquired the Harvester to help her.\n\n“Yes,” said the Girl. “I don't know how to make you see.”\n\n“Take any kind of a plunge. I'm not usually dense.”\n\n“It is really quite simple after all. It's about a girl----a girl I\nknew very well in Chicago. She had a problem----and it worried her\ndreadfully, and I just wondered what you would think of it.”\n\nThe Harvester shifted his position so that he could watch the side of\nthe averted face.\n\n“You'll have to tell me, before I can tell you,” he suggested.\n\n“She was a girl who never had anything from life but work and worry. Of\ncourse, that's the only kind I'd know! One day when the work was most\ndifficult, and worry cut deepest, and she really thought she was losing\nher mind, a man came by and helped her. He lifted her out, and rescued\nall that was possible for a man to save to her in honour, and went his\nway. There wasn't anything more. Probably there never would be. His\nheart was great, and he stooped and pitied her gently and passed on.\nAfter a time another man came by, a good and noble man, and he offered\nher love so wonderful she hadn't brains to comprehend how or why it\nwas.”\n\nThe Girl's voice trailed off as if she were too weary to speak further,\nwhile she leaned her head against a pillar and gazed with dull eyes\nacross the lake.\n\n“And your question,” suggested the Harvester at last.\n\nShe roused herself. “Oh, the question! Why this----if in time, and\nafter she had tried and tried, love to equal his simply would not come\nwould----would----she be wrong to PRETEND she cared, and do the very\nbest she could, and hope for real love some day? Oh David, would she?”\n\nThe Harvester's face was whiter than the Girl's. He pounded the chisel\ninto the joist savagely.\n\n“Would she, David?”\n\n“Let me understand you clearly,” said the man in a dry, breathless\nvoice. “Did she love this first man to whom she came under obligations?”\n\nThe Girl sat gazing across the lake and the tortured Harvester stared at\nher.\n\n“I don't know,” she said at last. “I don't know whether she knew what\nlove was or ever could. She never before had known a man; her heart was\nas undeveloped and starved as her body. I don't think she realized love,\nbut there was a SOMETHING. Every time she would feel most grateful and\nlong for the love that was offered her, that 'something' would awake and\nhurt her almost beyond endurance. Yet she knew he never would come. She\nknew he did not care for her. I don't know that she felt she wanted him,\nbut she was under such obligations to him that it seemed as if she must\nwait to see if he might not possibly come, and if he did she should be\nfree.”\n\n“If he came, she preferred him?”\n\n“There was a debt she had to pay----if he asked it. I don't know whether\nshe preferred him. I do know she had no idea that he would come, but the\nPOSSIBILITY was always before her. If he didn't come in time, would she\nbe wrong in giving all she had to the man who loved her?”\n\nThe Harvester's laugh was short and sharp.\n\n“She had nothing to give, Ruth! Talk about worm-wood, colocynth apples,\nand hemlock! What sort of husks would that be to offer a man who gave\nhonest love? Lie to him! Pretend feeling she didn't experience. Endure\nhim for the sake of what he offered her? Well I don't know how calmly\nany other man would take that proceeding, Ruth, but tell your friend for\nme, that if I offered a woman the deep, lasting, and only loving passion\nof my heart, and she gave back a lie and indifferent lips, I'd drop her\ninto the deepest hole of my lake and take my punishment cheerfully.”\n\n“But if it would make him happy? He deserves every happiness, and he\nneed never know!”\n\nThe Harvester's laugh raised to an angry roar.\n\n“You simpleton!” he cried roughly. “Do you know so little of human\npassion in the heart that you think love can be a successful assumption?\nGood Lord, Ruth! Do you think a man is made of wood or stone, that a\nwoman's lips in her first kiss wouldn't tell him the truth? Why Girl,\nyou might as well try to spread your tired arms and fly across the lake\nas to attempt to pretend a love you do not feel. You never could!”\n\n“I said a girl I knew!”\n\n“'A Girl you knew,' then! Any woman! The idea is monstrous. Tell her so\nand forget it. You almost scared the life out of me for a minute, Ruth.\nI thought it was going to be you. But I remember your debt is to be paid\nwith the first money you earn, and you can not have the slightest idea\nwhat love is, if you honestly ask if it can be simulated. No ma'am! It\ncan't! Not possibly! Not ever! And when the day comes that its fires\nlight your heart, you will come to me, and tell of a flood of delight\nthat is tingling from the soles of your feet through every nerve and\nfibre of your body, and you will laugh with me at the time when you\nasked if it could be imitated successfully. No, ma'am! Now let me help\nyou to the cabin, serve a good supper, and see you eat like a farmer.”\n\nAll evening the Harvester was so gay he kept the Girl laughing and at\nlast she asked him the cause.\n\n“Relief, honey! Relief!” cried the man. “You had me paralyzed for a\nminute, Ruth. I thought you were trying to tell me that there was some\none so possessing your heart that it failed every time you tried\nto think about caring for me. If you hadn't convinced me before you\nfinished that love never has touched you, I'd be the saddest man in the\nworld to-night, Ruth.”\n\nThe Girl stared at him with wide eyes and silently turned away.\n\nThen for a week they worked out life together in the woods. The\nHarvester was the housekeeper and the cook. He added to his store many\ndelicious broths and stimulants he brought from the city. They drove\nevery day through the cool woods, often rowed on the lake in the\nevenings, walked up the hill to the oak and scattered fresh flowers\non the two mounds there, and sat beside them talking for a time. The\nHarvester kept up his work with the herbs, and the little closet for\nthe blue dishes was finished. They celebrated installing them by having\nsupper on the living-room table, with the teapot on one end, and the\npitcher full of bellflowers on the other.\n\nThe Girl took everything prescribed for her, bathed, slept all she\ncould, and worked for health with all the force of her frail being, and\nas the days went by it seemed to the Harvester her weight grew lighter,\nher hands hotter, and she drove herself to a gayety almost delirious. He\nthought he would have preferred a dull, stupid sleep of malaria. There\nwas colour in plenty on her cheeks now, and sometimes he found her\nwrapped in the white shawl at noon on the warmest days Medicine Woods\nknew in early August; and on cool nights she wore the thinnest clothing\nand begged to be taken on the lake. The Careys came out every other\nevening and the doctor watched and worked, but he did not get the\nresults he desired. His medicines were not effective.\n\n“David,” he said one evening, “I don't like the looks of this. Your wife\nhas fever I can't break. It is eating the little store of vitality she\nhas right out of her, and some of these days she is coming down with a\ncrash. She should yield to the remedies I am giving her. She acts to\nme like a woman driven wild by trouble she is concealing. Do you know\nanything that worries her?”\n\n“No,” said the Harvester, “but I'll try to find out if it will help you\nin your work.”\n\nAfter they were gone he left the Girl lying in the swing guarded by the\ndog, and went across the marsh on the excuse that he was going to a bed\nof thorn apple at the foot of the hill. There he sat on a log and tried\nto think. With the mists of night rising around him, ghosts arose he\nfain would have escaped. “What will you give me in cold cash to tell you\nwho she is, and who her people are?” Times untold in the past two weeks\nhe had smothered, swallowed, and choked it down. That question she had\nwanted to ask----was it for a girl she had known, or was it for herself?\nDays of thought had deepened the first slight impression he so bravely\nhad put aside, not into certainty, but a great fear that she had meant\nherself. If she did, what was he to do? Who was the man? There was a\ndebt she had to pay if he asked it? What debt could a woman pay a man\nthat did not involve money? Crouched on a log he suffered and twisted\nin agonizing thought. At last he arose and returned to the cabin. He\ncarried a few frosty, blue-green leaves of velvet softness and unusual\ncutting, prickly thorn apples full of seeds, and some of the smoother,\nmore yellowish-green leaves of the jimson weed, to give excuse for his\nabsence.\n\n“Don't touch them,” he warned as he came to her. “They are poison\nand have disagreeable odour. But we are importing them for medicinal\npurposes. On the far side of the marsh, where the ground rises, there\nis a waste place just suited to them, and so long as they will seed\nand flourish with no care at all, I might as well have the price as\nthe foreign people who raise them. They don't bring enough to make them\nworth cultivating, but when they grow alone and with no care, I can make\nmoney on the time required to clip the leaves and dry the seeds. I must\ngo wash before I come close to you.”\n\nThe next day he had business in the city, and again she lay in the swing\nand talked to the dog while the Harvester was gone. She was startled as\nBelshazzar arose with a gruff bark. She looked down the driveway, but no\none was coming. Then she followed the dog's eyes and saw a queer,\nlittle old woman coming up the bank of Singing Water from the north. She\nremembered what the Harvester had said, and rising she opened the screen\nand went down the path. As the Girl advanced she noticed the scrupulous\ncleanliness of the calico dress and gingham apron, and the snowy hair\nframing a bronzed face with dancing dark eyes.\n\n“Are you David's new wife?” asked Granny Moreland with laughing\ninflection.\n\n“Yes,” said the Girl. “Come in. He told me to expect you. I am so sorry\nhe is away, but we can get acquainted without him. Let me help you.”\n\n“I don't know but that ought to be the other way about. You don't look\nvery strong, child.”\n\n“I am not well,” said the Girl, “but it's lovely here, and the air is\nso fine I am going to be better soon. Take this chair until you rest a\nlittle, and then you shall see our pretty home, and all the furniture\nand my dresses.”\n\n“Yes, I want to see things. My, but David has tried himself! I heard\nhe was just tearin' up Jack over here, and I could get the sound of the\nhammerin', and one day he asked me to come and see about his beddin'. He\nhad that Lizy Crofter to wash for him, but if I hadn't jest stood over\nher his blankets would have been ruined. She's no more respect for\nfine goods than a pig would have for cream pie. I hate to see woollens\nabused, as if they were human. My, but things is fancy here since what\nDavid planted is growin'! Did you ever live in the country before?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Where do you hail from?”\n\n“Well not from the direction of hail,” laughed the Girl. “I lived in\nChicago, but we were----were not rich, and so I didn't know the luxury\nof the city; just the lonely, difficult part.”\n\n“Do you call Chicago lonely?”\n\n“A thousand times more so than Medicine Woods. Here I know the trees\nwill whisper to me, and the water laughs and sings all day, and the\nbirds almost split their throats making music for me; but I can imagine\nno loneliness on earth that will begin to compare with being among the\ncrowds and crowds of a large city and no one has a word or look for you.\nI miss the sea of faces and the roar of life; at first I was almost wild\nwith the silence, but now I don't find it still any more; the Harvester\nis teaching me what each sound means and they seem to be countless.”\n\n“You think, then, you'll like it here?”\n\n“I do, indeed! Any one would. Even more than the beautiful location, I\nlove the interesting part of the Harvester's occupation. I really think\nthat gathering material to make medicines that will allay pain is the\nvery greatest of all the great work a man can do.”\n\n“Good!” cried Granny Moreland, her dark eyes snapping. “I've always\nsaid it! I've tried to encourage David in it. And he's just capital at\nputtin' some of his stuff in shape, and combinin' it in as good medicine\nas you ever took. This spring I was all crippled up with the rheumatiz\nuntil I wanted to holler every time I had to move, and sometimes it got\nso aggravatin' I'm not right sure but I done it. 'Long comes David and\nsays, 'I can fix you somethin',' and bless you, if the boy didn't take\nthe tucks out of me, until here I am, and tickled to pieces that I can\nget here. This time last year I didn't care if I lived or not. Now seems\nas if I'm caperish as a three weeks' lamb. I don't see how a man could\ndo a bigger thing than to stir up life in you like that.”\n\n“I think this place makes an especial appeal to me, because, shortly\nbefore I came, I had to give up my mother. She was very ill and suffered\nhorribly. Every time I see David going to his little laboratory on\nthe hill to work a while I slip away and ask God to help him to fix\nsomething that will ease the pain of humanity as I should like to have\nseen her relieved.”\n\n“Why you poor child! No wonder you are lookin' so thin and peaked!”\n\n“Oh I'll soon be over that,” said the Girl. “I am much better than when\nI came. I'll be coming over to trade pie with you before long. David\nsays you are my nearest neighbour, so we must be close friends.”\n\n“Well bless your big heart! Now who ever heard of a pretty young thing\nlike you wantin' to be friends with a plain old country woman?”\n\n“Why I think you are lovely!” cried the Girl. “And all of us are on the\nway to age, so we must remember that we will want kindness then more\nthan at any other time. David says you knew his mother. Sometime won't\nyou tell me all about her? You must very soon. The Harvester adored her,\nand Doctor Carey says she was the noblest woman he ever knew. It's a\nbig contract to take her place. Maybe if you would tell me all you can\nremember I could profit by much of it.”\n\nGranny Moreland watched the Girl keenly.\n\n“She wa'ant no ordinary woman, that's sure,” she commented. “And she\ndidn't make no common man out of her son, either. I've always contended\nshe took the job too serious, and wore herself out at it, but she\ncertainly done the work up prime. If she's above cloud leanin' over the\nramparts lookin' down----though it gets me as to what foundation they\nuse or where they get the stuff to build the ramparts----but if they\nis ramparts, and she's peekin' over them, she must take a lot of solid\nsatisfaction in seeing that David is not only the man she fought and\ndied to make him, but he's give her quite a margin to spread herself\non. She 'lowed to make him a big man, but you got to know him close\nand plenty 'fore it strikes you jest what his size is. I've watched him\npretty sharp, and tried to help what I could since Marthy went, and I'm\nfrank to say I druther see David happy than to be happy myself. I've had\nmy fling. The rest of the way I'm willin' to take what comes, with the\nbest grace I can muster, and wear a smilin' face to betoken the joy I\nhave had; but it cuts me sore to see the young sufferin'.”\n\n“Do you think David is unhappy?” asked the Girl eagerly.\n\n“I don't see how he could be!” cried the old lady. “Of course he\nain't! 'Pears as if he's got everythin' to make him the proudest, best\nsatisfied of men. I'll own I was mighty anxious to see you. I know\nthe kind o' woman it would take to make David miserable, and it seems\nsometimes as if men----that is good men----are plumb, stone blind when\nit comes to pickin' a woman. They jest hitch up with everlastin' misery\neasy as dew rolling off a cabbage leaf. It's sech a blessed sight to see\nyou, and hear your voice and know you're the woman anybody can see you\nbe. Why I'm so happy when I set here and con-tem'-plate you, I want\nto cackle like a pullet announcin' her first egg. Ain't this porch the\npurtiest place?”\n\n“Come see everything,” invited the Girl, rising.\n\nGranny Moreland followed with alacrity.\n\n“Bare floors!” she cried. “Wouldn't that best you? I saw they was\nfinished capital when I was over, but I 'lowed they'd be covered afore\nyou come. Don't you like nice, flowery Brissels carpets, honey?”\n\n“No I don't,” said the Girl. “You see, when rugs are dusty they can be\nrolled, carried outside, and cleaned. The walls can be wiped, the floors\npolished and that way a house is always fresh. I can keep this shining,\ngerm proof, and truly clean with half the work and none of the danger of\nheavy carpets and curtains.”\n\n“I don't doubt but them is true words,” said Granny Moreland earnestly.\n“Work must be easier and sooner done than it was in my day, or people\njest couldn't have houses the size of this or the time to gad that women\nhave now. From the looks of the streets of Onabasha, you wouldn't think\na woman 'ud had a baby to tend, a dinner pot a-bilin', or a bakin' of\nbread sence the flood. And the country is jest as bad as the city. We're\na apin' them to beat the monkeys at a show. I hardly got a neighbour\nthat ain't got figgered Brissels carpet, a furnace, a windmill, a\npianny, and her own horse and buggy. Several's got autermobiles, and the\nyoung folks are visitin' around a-ridin' the trolleys, goin' to college,\nand copyin' city ways. Amos Peters, next to us; goes bareheaded in the\nhay field, and wears gloves to pitch and plow in. I tell him he reminds\nme of these city women that only wears the lower half of a waist and no\nsleeves, and a yard of fine goods moppin' the floors. Well if that don't\n'beat the nation! Ain't them Marthy's old blue dishes?”\n\n“Let me show you!” The Girl opened the little cupboard and exhibited the\nwillow ware. The eyes of the old woman began to sparkle.\n\n“Foundation or no foundation, I do hope them ramparts is a go!” she\ncried. “If Marthy Langston is squintin' over them and she sees her old\nchany put in a fine cupboard, and her little shawl round as purty a girl\nas ever stepped, and knows her boy is gittin' what he deserves, good\nLord, she'll be like to oust the Almighty, and set on the throne\nherself! 'Bout everythin' in life was a disappointment to her, 'cept\nDavid. Now if she could see this! Won't I rub it into the neighbours?\nAnd my boys' wives!”\n\n“I don't understand,” said the bewildered Girl.\n\n“'Course you don't, honey,” explained the visitor. “It's like this: I\ndon't know anybody, man or woman, in these parts, that ain't rampagin'\nfor CHANGE. They ain't one of them that would live in a log cabin,\nthough they's not a house in twenty miles of here that fits its\nsurroundin's and looks so homelike as this. They run up big, fancy brick\nand frame things, all turns and gables and gay as frosted picnic pie,\nand work and slave to git these very carpets you say ain't healthy,\nand the chairs you say you wouldn't give house room, an' they use their\ngrandmother's chany for bakin', scraps, and grease dishes, and hide it\nif they's visitors. All of them strainin' after something they can't\nafford, and that ain't healthy when they git it, because somebody else\nis doin' the same thing. Mary Peters says she is afeared of her life in\ntheir new steam wagon, and she says Andy gits so narvous runnin' it, he\njest keeps on a-jerkin' and drivin' all night, and she thinks he'll\nsoon go to smash himself, if the machine doesn't beat him. But they\nare keepin' it up, because Graceston's is, and so it goes all over the\ncountry. Now I call it a slap right in the face to have a Chicagy woman\ncome to the country to live and enjoy a log cabin, bare floors, and her\nman's grandmother's dishes. If there ain't Marthy's old blue coverlid\nalso carefully spread on a splinter new sofy. Landy, I can't wait to get\nto my son John's! He's got a woman that would take two coppers off the\ncollection plate while she was purtendin' to put on one, if she could,\nand then spend them for a brass pin or a string of glass beads. Won't\nher eyes bung when I tell her about this? She wanted my Peter Hartman\nkiver for her ironin' board. Show me the rest!”\n\n“This is the dining-room,” said the Girl, leading the way.\n\nGranny Moreland stepped in and sent her keen eyes ranging over the\nfloor, walls, and furnishings. She sank on a chair and said with a\nchuckle, “Now you go on and tell me all about it, honey. Jest what\nthings are and why you fixed them, and how they are used.”\n\nThe Girl did her best, and the old woman nodded in delighted approval.\n\n“It's the purtiest thing I ever saw,” she announced. “A minute ago, I'd\n'a' said them blue walls back there, jest like October skies in Indian\nsummer, and the brown rugs, like leaves in the woods, couldn't be beat;\nbut this green and yaller is purtier yet. That blue room will keep the\nbest lookin' part of fall on all winter, and with a roarin' wood fire,\nit'll be capital, and no mistake; but this here is spring, jest spring\neternal, an' that's best of all. Looks like it was about time the leaves\nwas bustin' and things pushin' up. It wouldn't surprise me a mite to see\na flock of swallers come sailin' right through these winders. And here's\na place big enough to lay down and rest a spell right handy to the\nkitchen, where a-body gits tiredest, without runnin' a half mile to find\na bed, and in the mornin' you can look down to the 'still waters'; and\nin the afternoon, when the sun gits around here, you can pull that blind\nand 'lift your eyes to the hills,' like David of the Bible says. My,\ndidn't he say the purtiest things! I never read nothin' could touch\nhim!”\n\n“Have you seen the Psalms arranged in verse as we would write it now?”\n\n“You don't mean to tell me David's been put into real poetry?”\n\n“Yes. Some Bibles have all the poetical books in our forms of verse.”\n\n“Well! Sometimes I git kind o' knocked out! As a rule I hold to old\nways. I think they're the healthiest and the most faver'ble to the soul.\nBut they's some changes come along, that's got sech hard common-sense\nto riccomend them, that I wonder the past generations didn't see sooner.\nNow take this! An hour ago I'd told you I'd read my father's Bible to\nthe end of my days. But if they's a new one that's got David, Solomon,\nand Job in nateral form, I'll have one, and I'll git a joy I never\nexpected out of life. I ain't got so much poetry in me, but it always\nriled me to read, '7. The law of the Lord is perfect, covertin' the\nsoul. 8. The statutes of the Lord are right. 9. The fear of the Lord\nis clean.' And so it goes on, 'bout as much figgers as they is poetry.\nAlways did worry me. So if they make Bibles 'cordin' to common sense,\nI'll have one to-morrow if I have to walk to Onabasha to get it. Lawsy\nme! if you ain't gathered up Marthy's old pink tea set, and give it a\nshow, too! Did you do that to please David, or do you honestly think\nthem is nice dishes?”\n\n“I think they are beautiful,” laughed the Girl, sinking to a chair. “I\ndon't know that it did please him. He had been studying the subject,\nbut something saved him from buying anything until I came. I'd have felt\ndreadfully if he had gotten what he wanted.”\n\n“What did he want, honey?” asked the old lady in an awestruck whisper.\n\n“Egg-shell china and cut glass.”\n\n“And you wouldn't let him! Woman! What do you want?”\n\n“A set of tulip-yellow dishes, with Dutch little figures on them. They\nare so quaint and they would harmonize perfectly with this room.”\n\nThe old lady laughed gleefully.\n\n“My! I wouldn't 'a' missed this for a dollar,” she cried. “It jest does\nmy soul good. More'n that, if you really like Marthy's dishes and are\ngoing to take care of them and use them right, I'll give you mine, too.\nI ain't never had a girl. I've always hoped she'd 'a' had some jedgment\nof her own, and not been eternally apin', if I had, but the Lord may 'a'\nsaved me many a disappointment by sendin' all mine boys. Not that I'm\nlayin' the babies on to the Lord at all----I jest got into the habit of\nsayin' that, 'cos everybody else does, but all mine, I had a purty\ngood idy how I got them. If a girl of mine wouldn't 'a' had more sense,\nraised right with me, I'd' a' been purty bad cut up over it. Of course,\nI can't be held responsible for the girls my boys married, but t'other\nday Emmeline----that's John's wife----John is the youngest, and I sort\no' cling to him----Emmeline she says to me, 'Mother, can't I have this\nold pink and green teapot?' My heart warmed right up to the child, and\nI says, 'What do you want it for, Emmeline?' And she says, 'To draw the\ntea in.' Cracky Dinah! That fool woman meant to set my grandmother's\nweddin' present from her pa and ma, dishes same as Marthy Washington\nused, on the stove to bile the tea in. I jest snorted! 'No, says I, 'you\ncan't! 'Fore I die,' says I, 'I'll meet up with some woman that 'll love\ndishes and know how to treat them.' I think jest about as much of David\nas I do my own boys, and I don't make no bones of the fact that he's a\nheap more of a man. I'd jest as soon my dishes went to his children\nas to John's. I'll give you every piece I got, if you'll take keer of\nthem.”\n\n“Would it be right?” wavered the girl.\n\n“Right! Why, I'm jest tellin' you the fool wimmen would bile tea in\nthem, make grease sassers of them, and use them to dish up the bakin'\non! Wouldn't you a heap rather see them go into a cupboard like David's\nma's is in, where they'd be taken keer of, if they was yours? I guess\nyou would!”\n\n“Well if you feel that way, and really want us to have them, I know\nDavid will build another little cupboard on the other side of the\nfireplace to put yours in, and I can't tell you how I'd love and care\nfor them.”\n\n“I'll jest do it!” said Granny Moreland. “I got about as many blue ones\nas Marthy had an' mine are purtier than hers. And my lustre is brighter,\nfor I didn't use it so much. Is this the kitchen? Well if I ever saw\nsech a cool, white place to cook in before! Ain't David the beatenest\nhand to think up things? He got the start of that takin' keer of his\nma all his life. He sort of learned what a woman uses, and how it's\nhandiest. Not that other men don't know; it's jest that they are too\nmortal selfish and keerless to fix things. Well this is great! Now when\nyou bile cabbage and the wash, always open your winders wide and let the\nsteam out, so it won't spile your walls.”\n\n“I'll be very careful,” promised the Girl. “Now come see my bathroom,\ncloset and bedroom.”\n\n“Well as I live! Ain't this fine. I'll bet a purty that if I'd 'a' had\na room and a trough like this to soak in when I was wore to a frazzle, I\nwouldn't 'a' got all twisted up with rheumatiz like I am. It jest looks\nrestful to see. I never washed in a place like this in all my days. Must\nfeel grand to be wet all over at once! Now everybody ought to have sech\na room and use it at all hours, like David does the lake. Did you ever\nsee his beat to go swimmin'? He's always in splashin'! Been at it all\nhis life. I used to be skeered when he was a little tyke. He soaked so\nmuch 'peared like he'd wash all the substance out of him, but it only\nmade him strong.”\n\n“Has he ever been ill?”\n\n“Not that I know of, and I reckon I'd knowed it if he had. Well what a\nclothespress! I never saw so many dresses at once. Ain't they purty? Oh\nI wish I was young, and could have one like that yaller. And I'd like to\nhave one like your lavender right now. My! You are lucky to have so many\nnice clothes. It's a good thing most girls haven't got them, or they'd\nstand primpin' all day tryin' to decide which one to put on. I don't see\nhow you tell yourself.”\n\n“I wear the one that best hides how pale I am,” answered the Girl. “I\nuse the colours now. When I grow plump and rosy, I'll wear the white.”\n\nGranny Moreland dropped on the couch and assured herself that it was\nMartha's pink Peter Hartman. Then she examined the sunshine room.\n\n“Well I got to go back to the start,” she said at last. “This beats the\ndinin'-room. This is the purtiest thing I ever saw. Oh I do hope they\nain't so run to white in Heaven as some folks seem to think! Used to be\nscandalized if a-body took anythin' but a white flower to a funeral. Now\nthey tell me that when Jedge Stilton's youngest girl come from New York\nto her pa's buryin' she fetched about a wash tub of blood-red roses.\nPut them all over him, too! Said he loved red roses livin' and so he\nwas goin' to have them when he passed over. Now if they are lettin' up a\nlittle on white on earth, mebby some of the stylish ones will carry the\nfashion over yander. If Heaven is like this, I won't spend none of my\ntime frettin' about the foundations. I'll jest forget there is any, even\nif we do always have to be so perticler to get them solid on earth. Talk\nof gold harps! Can't you almost hear them? And listen to the birds and\nthat water! Say, you won't get lonesome here, will you?”\n\n“Indeed no!” answered the Girl. “Wouldn't you like to lie on my\nbeautiful couch that the Harvester made with his own hands, and I'll\nspread Mother Langston's coverlet over you and let you look at all my\npretty things while I slip away a few minutes to something I'd like to\ndo?”\n\n“I'd love to!” said the old woman. “I never had a chance at such fine\nthings. David told me he was makin' your room all himself, and that he\nwas goin' to fill it chuck full of everythin' a girl ever used, and\nI see he done it right an' proper. Away last March he told me he was\nbuildin' for you, an' I hankered so to have a woman here again, even\nthough I never s'posed she'd be sochiable like you, that I egged him\non jest all I could. I never would 'a' s'posed the boy could marry like\nthis----all by himself.”\n\nThe Girl went to the ice chest to bring some of the fruit juice, chilled\nberries, and to the pantry for bread and wafers to make a dainty little\nlunch that she placed on the veranda table; and then she and Granny\nMoreland talked, until the visitor said that she must go. The Girl went\nwith her to the little bridge crossing Singing Water on the north. There\nthe old lady took her hand.\n\n“Honey,” she said, “I'm goin' to tell you somethin'. I am so happy I can\npurt near fly. Last night I was comin' down the pike over there chasin'\nhome a contrary old gander of mine, and I looked over on your land and\nI see David settin' on a log with his head between his hands a lookin'\nlike grim death, if I ever see it. My heart plum stopped. Says I, 'she's\na failure! She's a bustin' the boy's heart! I'll go straight over and\ntell her so.' I didn't dare bespeak him, but I was on nettles all night.\nI jest laid a-studyin' and a-studyin', and I says, 'Come mornin' I'll\ngo straight and give her a curry-combin' that'll do her good.' And I\nstarted a-feelin' pretty grim, and here you came to meet me, and\nwiped it all out of my heart in a flash. It did look like the boy was\ngrievin'; but I know now he was jest thinkin' up what to put together\nto take the ache out of some poor old carcass like mine. It never could\nhave been about you. Like a half blind old fool I thought the boy was\nsufferin', and here he was only studyin'! Like as not he was thinkin'\nwhat to do next to show you how he loves you. What an old silly I was!\nI'll sleep like a log to-night to pay up for it. Good-bye, honey! You\nbetter go back and lay down a spell. You do look mortal tired.”\n\nThe Girl said good-bye and staggering a few steps sank on a log and sat\nstaring at the sky.\n\n“Oh he was suffering, and about me!” she gasped. A chill began to shake\nher and feverish blood to race through her veins. “He does and gives\neverything; I do and give nothing! Oh why didn't I stay at Uncle Henry's\nuntil it ended? It wouldn't have been so bad as this. What will I do? Oh\nwhat will I do? Oh mother, mother! if I'd only had the courage you did.”\n\nShe arose and staggered up the hill, passed the cabin and went to the\noak. There she sank shivering to earth, and laid her face among the\nmosses. The frightened Harvester found her at almost dusk when he came\nfrom the city with the Dutch dishes, and helped a man launch a gay\nlittle motor boat for her on the lake.\n\n“Why Ruth! Ruth-girl!” he exclaimed, kneeling beside her.\n\nShe lifted a strained, distorted face.\n\n“Don't touch me! Don't come near me!” she cried. “It is not true that I\nam better. I am not! I am worse! I never will be better. And before I go\nI've got to tell you of the debt I owe; then you will hate me, and then\nI will be glad! Glad, I tell you! Glad! When you despise me? then I can\ngo, and know that some day you will love a girl worthy of you. Oh I want\nyou to hate me I am fit for nothing else.”\n\nShe fell forward sobbing wildly and the Harvester tried in vain to quiet\nher. At last he said, “Well then tell me, Ruth. Remember I don't want to\nhear what you have to say. I will believe nothing against you, not even\nfrom your own lips, when you are feverish and excited as now, but if\nit will quiet you, tell me and have it over. See, I will sit here and\nlisten, and when you have finished I'll pick you up and carry you to\nyour room, and I am not sure but I will kiss you over and over. What is\nit you want to tell me, Ruth?”\n\nShe sat up panting and pushed back the heavy coils of hair.\n\n“I've got to begin away at the beginning to make you see,” she said.\n“The first thing I can remember is a small, such a small room, and\nmother sewing and sometimes a man I called father. He was like Henry\nJameson made over tall and smooth, and more, oh, much more heartless! He\nwas gone long at a time, and always we had most to eat, and went oftener\nto the parks, and were happiest with him away. When I was big enough to\nunderstand, mother told me that she had met him and cared for him when\nshe was an inexperienced girl. She must have been very, very young, for\nshe was only a girl as I first remember her, and oh! so lovely, but\nwith the saddest face I ever saw. She said she had a good home and every\nluxury, and her parents adored her; but they knew life and men, and they\nwould not allow him in their home, and so she left it with him, and he\nmarried her and tried to force them to accept him, and they would not.\nAt first she bore it. Later she found him out, and appealed to them,\nbut they were away or would not forgive, and she was a proud thing, and\nwould not beg more after she had said she was wrong, and would they take\nher back.\n\n“I grew up and we were girls together. We embroidered, and I drew, and\nsometimes we had little treats and good times, and my father did not\ncome often, and we got along the best we could. Always it was worse\non her, because she was not so strong as I, and her heart was secretly\nbreaking for her mother, and she was afraid he would come back any\nhour. She was tortured that she could not educate me more than to put\nme through the high school. She wore herself out doing that, but she was\nwild for me to be reared and trained right. So every day she crouched\nover delicate laces and embroidery, and before and after school I\ncarried it and got more, and in vacation we worked together. But living\ngrew higher, and she became ill, and could not work, and I hadn't her\nskill, and the drawings didn't bring much, and I'd no tools----”\n\n“Ruth, for mercy sake let me take you in my arms. If you've got to tell\nthis to find peace, let me hold you while you do it.”\n\n“Never again,” said the Girl. “You won't want to in a minute. You must\nhear this, because I can't bear it any longer, and it isn't fair to let\nyou grieve and think me worth loving. Anyway, I couldn't earn what she\ndid, and I was afraid, for a great city is heartless to the poor. One\nmorning she fainted and couldn't get up. I can see the awful look in her\neyes now. She knew what was coming. I didn't. I tried to be brave and\nto work. Oh it's no use to go on with that! It was just worse and worse.\nShe was lovely and delicate, she was my mother, and I adored her. Oh\nMan! You won't judge harshly?”\n\n“No!” cried the Harvester, “I won't judge at all, Ruth. I see now. Get\nit over if you must tell me.”\n\n“One day she had been dreadfully ill for a long time and there was no\nfood or work or money, and the last scrap was pawned, and she simply\nwould not let me notify the charities or tell me who or where her people\nwere. She said she had sinned against them and broken their hearts,\nand probably they were dead, and I was desperate. I walked all day from\nhouse to house where I had delivered work, but it was no use; no one\nwanted anything I could do, and I went back frantic, and found her\ngnawing her fingers and gibbering in delirium. She did not know me, and\nfor the first time she implored me for food.\n\n“Then I locked the door and went on the street and I asked a woman. She\nlaughed and said she'd report me and I'd be locked up for begging.\nThen I saw a man I passed sometimes. I thought he lived close. I went\nstraight to him, and told him my mother was very ill, and asked him\nto help her. He told me to go to the proper authorities. I told him I\ndidn't know who they were or where, and I had no money and she was a\nwoman of refinement, and never would forgive me. I offered, if he would\ncome to see her, get her some beef tea, and take care of her while she\nlived, that afterward----”\n\nThe Girl's frail form shook in a storm of sobs. At last she lifted her\neyes to the Harvester's. “There must be a God, and somewhere at the\nlast extremity He must come in. The man went with me, and he was a young\ndoctor who had an office a few blocks away, and he knew what to do. He\nhadn't much himself, but for several weeks he divided and she was more\ncomfortable and not hungry when she went. When it was over I dressed\nher the best I could in my graduation dress, and folded her hands, and\nkissed her good-bye, and told him I was ready to fulfill my offer; and\noh Man!----He said he had forgotten!”\n\n“God!” panted the Harvester.\n\n“We couldn't bury her there. But I remembered my father had said he had\na brother in the country, and once he had been to see us when I was very\nlittle, and the doctor telegraphed him, and he answered that his wife\nwas sick, and if I was able to work I could come, and he would bury her,\nand give me a home. The doctor borrowed the money and bought the coffin\nyou found her in. He couldn't do better or he would, for he learned to\nlove her. He paid our fares and took us to the train. Before I started\nI went on my knees to him and worshipped him as the Almighty, and I am\nsure I told him that I always would be indebted to him, and any time he\nrequired I would pay. The rest you know.”\n\n“Have you heard from him, Ruth?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“It WAS yourself the other day on the bridge?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did he love you?”\n\n“Not that I know of. No! Nobody but you would love a girl who appeared\nas I did then.”\n\nThe Harvester strove to keep a set face, but his lips drew back from his\nteeth.\n\n“Ruth, do you love him?”\n\n“Love!” cried the Girl. “A pale, expressionless word! Adore would come\ncloser! I tell you she was delirious with hunger, and he fed her. She\nwas suffering horrors and he eased the pain. She was lifeless, and\nhe kept her poor tired body from the dissecting table. I would have\nfulfilled my offer, and gone straight into the lake, but he spared me,\nMan! He spared me! Worship is a good word. I think I worship him. I\ntried to tell you. Before you got that license, I wanted you to know.”\n\n“I remember,” said the Harvester. “But no man could have guessed that a\ngirl with your face had agony like that in her heart, not even when he\nread deep trouble there.”\n\n“I should have told you then! I should have forced you to hear! I was\nwild with fear of Uncle Henry, and I had nowhere to go. Now you know! Go\naway, and the end will come soon.”\n\nThe Harvester arose and walked a few steps toward the lake, where he\npaused stricken, but fighting for control. For him the light had gone\nout. There was nothing beyond. The one passion of his life must live on,\nsatisfied with a touch from lips that loved another man. Broken sobbing\ncame to him. He did not even have time to suffer. Stumblingly he turned\nand going to the Girl he picked her up, and sat on the bench holding her\nclosely.\n\n“Stop it, Ruth!” he said unsteadily. “Stop this! Why should you suffer\nso? I simply will not have it. I will save you against yourself and the\nworld. You shall have all happiness yet; I swear it, my girl! You are\nall right. He was a noble man, and he spared you because he loved you,\nof course. I will make you well and rosy again, and then I will go and\nfind him, and arrange everything for you. I have spared you, too, and if\nhe doesn't want you to remain here with me, Mrs. Carey would be glad\nto have you until I can free you. Judges are human. It will be a simple\nmatter. Hush, Ruth, listen to me! You shall be free! At once, if you\nsay so! You shall have him! I will go and bring him here, and I will go\naway. Ruth, darling, stop crying and hear me. You will grow better, now\nthat you have told me. It is this secret that has made you feverish\nand kept you ill. Ruth, you shall have happiness yet, if I have got to\ncircle the globe and scale the walls of Heaven to find it for you.”\n\nShe struggled from his arms and ran toward the lake. When the Harvester\ncaught her, she screamed wildly, and struck him with her thin white\nhands. He lifted and carried her to the laboratory, where he gave her a\nfew drops from a bottle and soon she became quiet. Then he took her to\nthe sunshine room, laid her on the bed, locked the screens and her door,\ncalled Belshazzar to watch, and ran to the stable. A few minutes later\nwith distended nostrils and indignant heart Betsy, under the flail of an\nunsparing lash, pounded down the hill toward Onabasha.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. LOVE INVADES SCIENCE\n\nThe Harvester placed the key in the door and turned to Doctor Carey and\nthe nurse.\n\n“I drugged her into unconsciousness before I left, but she may have\nreturned, at least partially. Miss Barnet, will you kindly see if she\nis ready for the doctor? You needn't be in the least afraid. She has no\nstrength, even in delirium.”\n\nHe opened the door, his head averted, and the nurse hurried into the\nroom. The Girl on the bed was beginning to toss, moan, and mutter.\nSkilful hands straightened her, arranged the covers, and the doctor was\ncalled. In the living-room the Harvester paced in misery too deep for\nconsecutive thought. As consciousness returned, the Girl grew wilder,\nand the nurse could not follow the doctor's directions and care for her.\nThen Doctor Carey called the Harvester. He went in and sitting beside\nthe bed took the feverish, wildly beating hands in his strong, cool\nones, and began stroking them and talking.\n\n“Easy, honey,” he murmured softly. “Lie quietly while I tell you. You\nmustn't tire yourself. You are wasting strength you need to fight the\nfever. I'll hold your hands tight, I'll stroke your head for you. Lie\nquietly, dear, and Doctor Carey and his head nurse are going to make you\nwell in a little while. That's right! Let me do the moving; you lie and\nrest. Only rest and rest, until all the pain is gone, and the strong\ndays come, and they are going to bring great joy, love, and peace, to my\ndear, dear girl. Even the moans take strength. Try just to lie quietly\nand rest. You can't hear Singing Water if you don't listen, Ruth.”\n\n“She doesn't realize that it is you or know what you say, David,” said\nDoctor Carey gently.\n\n“I understand,” said the Harvester. “But if you will observe, you will\nsee that she is quiet when I stroke her head and hands, and if you\nnotice closely you will grant that she gets a word occasionally. If it\nis the right one, it helps. She knows my voice and touch, and she is\nless nervous and afraid with me. Watch a minute!”\n\nThe Harvester took both of the Girl's fluttering hands in one of his\nand with long, light strokes gently brushed them, and then her head, and\nface, and then her hands again, and in a low, monotonous, half sing-song\nvoice he crooned, “Rest, Ruth, rest! It is night now. The moon is\nbridging Loon Lake, and the whip-poor-will is crying. Listen, dear,\ndon't you hear him crying? Still, Girl, still! Just as quiet! Lie so\nquietly. The whip-poor-will is going to tell his mate he loves her,\nloves her so dearly. He is going to tell her, when you listen. That's a\ndear girl. Now he is beginning. He says, 'Come over the lake and listen\nto the song I'm singing to you, my mate, my mate, my dear, dear mate,'\nand the big night moths are flying; and the katydids are crying,\npositive and sure they are crying, a thing that's past denying. Hear\nthem crying? And the ducks are cheeping, soft little murmurs while\nthey're sleeping, sleeping. Resting, softly resting! Gently, Girl,\ngently! Down the hill comes Singing Water, laughing, laughing! Don't you\nhear it laughing? Listen to the big owl courting; it sees the coon out\nhunting, it hears the mink softly slipping, slipping, where the dews of\nnight are dripping. And the little birds are sleeping, so still they\nare sleeping. Girls should be a-sleeping, like the birds a-sleeping,\nfor to-morrow joy comes creeping, joy and life and love come creeping,\ncreeping to my Girl. Gently, gently, that's a dear girl, gently! Tired\nhands rest easy, tired head lies still! That's the way to rest----”\n\nOn and on the even voice kept up the story. All over and around the\nlake, the length of Singing Water, the marsh folk found voices to tell\nof their lives, where it was a story of joy, rest, and love. Up the hill\nranged the Harvester, through the forest where the squirrels slept, the\nowl hunted, the fire-flies flickered, the fairies squeezed flower leaves\nto make colour to paint the autumn foliage, and danced on toadstool\nplatforms. Just so long as his voice murmured and his touch continued,\nso long the Girl lay quietly, and the medicines could act. But no other\ntouch would serve, and no other voice would answer. If the harvester\nleft the room five minutes to show the nurse how to light the fire, and\nwhere to find things, he returned to tossing, restless delirium.\n\n“It's magic David,” said Doctor Carey. “Magic!”\n\n“It is love,” said the Harvester. “Even crazed with fever, she\nrecognizes its voice and touch. You've got your work cut out, Doc. Roll\nyour sleeves and collect your wits. Set your heart on winning. There is\none thing shall not happen. Get that straight in your mind, right\nnow. And you too, Miss Barnet! There is nothing like fighting for a\ncertainty. You may think the Girl is desperately ill, and she is, but\nmake up your minds that you are here to fight for her life, and to save\nit. Save, do you understand? If she is to go, I don't need either of\nyou. I can let her do that myself. You are here on a mission of life.\nKeep it before you! Life and health for this Girl is the prize you are\ngoing to win. Dig into it, and I'll pay the bills, and extra besides. If\nmoney is any incentive, I'll give you all I've got for life and health\nfor the Girl. Are you doing all you know?”\n\n“I certainly am, David.”\n\n“But when day comes you'll have to go back to the hospital and we may\nnot know how to meet crises that will arise. What then? We should have a\ncompetent physician in the house until this fever breaks.”\n\n“I had thought of that, David. I will arrange to send one of the men\nfrom the hospital who will be able to watch symptoms and come for me\nwhen needed.”\n\n“Won't do!” said the Harvester calmly. “She has no strength for waiting.\nYou are to come when you can, and remain as long as possible. The case\nis yours; your decisions go, but I will select your assistant. I know\nthe man I want.”\n\n“Who is he, David?”\n\n“I'll tell you when I learn whether I can get him. Now I want you to\ngive the Girl the strongest sedative you dare, take off your coat, roll\nyour sleeves, and see how well you can imitate my voice, and how much\nyou have profited by listening to my song. In other words, before day\ncalls, I want you to take my place so successfully that you deceive her,\nand give me time to make a trip to town. There are a few things that\nmust be done, and I think I can work faster in the night. Will you?”\n\nDoctor Carey bent over the bed. Gently he slipped a practised hand under\nthe Harvester's and made the next stroke down the white arm. Gradually\nhe took possession of the thin hands and his touch fell on the masses of\ndark hair. As the Harvester arose the doctor took the seat.\n\n“You go on!” he ordered gruffly. “I'll do better alone.”\n\nThe Harvester stepped back. The doctor's touch was easy and the Girl lay\nquietly for an instant, then she moved restlessly.\n\n“You must be still now,” he said gently. “The moon is up, the lake is\nall white, and the birds are flying all around. Lie still or you'll make\nyourself worse. Stiller than that! If you don't you can't hear things\ncourting. The ducks are quacking, the bull frogs are croaking, and\neverything. Lie still, still, I tell you!”\n\n“Oh good Lord, Doc!” groaned the Harvester in desperation.\n\nThe Girl wrenched her hands free and her head rolled on the pillow.\n\n“Harvester! Harvester!” she cried.\n\nThe doctor started to arise.\n\n“Sit still!” commanded the Harvester. “Take her hands and go to work,\nidiot! Give her more sedative, and tell her I'm coming. That's the word,\nif she realizes enough to call for me.”\n\nThe doctor possessed himself of the flying hands, and gently held and\nstroked them.\n\n“The Harvester is coming,” he said. “Wait just a minute, he's on the\nway. He is coming. I think I hear him. He will be here soon, very soon\nnow. That's a good girl! Lie still for David. He won't like it if you\ntoss and moan. Just as still, lie still so I can listen. I can't tell\nwhether he is coming until you are quiet.”\n\nThen he said to the Harvester, “You see, I've got it now. I can manage\nher, but for pity sake, hurry man! Take the car! Jim is asleep on the\nback seat----Yes, yes, Girl! I'm listening for him. I think I hear him!\nI think he's coming!”\n\nHere and there a word penetrated, and she lay more quietly, but not in\nthe rest to which the Harvester had lulled her.\n\n“Hurry man!” groaned the doctor in a whispered aside, and the Harvester\nran to the car, awakened the driver and told him he had a clear road to\nOnabasha, to speed up.\n\n“Where to?” asked the driver.\n\n“Dickson, of the First National.”\n\nIn a few minutes the car stopped before the residence and the Harvester\nmade an attack on the front door. Presently the man came.\n\n“Excuse me for routing you out at this time of night,” said the\nHarvester, “but it's a case of necessity. I have an automobile here.\nI want you to go to the bank with me, and get me an address from your\ndraft records. I know the rules, but I want the name of my wife's\nChicago physician. She is delirious, and I must telephone him.”\n\nThe cashier stepped out and closed the door.\n\n“Nine chances out of ten it will be in the vault,” he said.\n\n“That leaves one that it won't,” answered the Harvester. “Sometimes I've\nlooked in when passing in the night, and I've noticed that the books are\nnot always put away. I could see some on the rack to-night. I think it\nis there.”\n\nIt was there, and the Harvester ordered the driver to hurry him to the\ntelephone exchange, then take the cashier home and return and wait. He\ncalled the Chicago Information office.\n\n“I want Dr. Frank Harmon, whose office address is 1509 Columbia Street.\nI don't know the 'phone number.”\n\nThen came a long wait, and after twenty minutes the blessed buzzing\nwhisper, “Here's your party.”\n\n“Doctor Harmon?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You remember Ruth Jameson, the daughter of a recent patient of yours?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Well my name is Langston. The Girl is in my home and care. She is very\nill with fever, and she has much confidence in you. This is Onabasha,\non the Grand Rapids and Indiana. You take the Pennsylvania at seven\no'clock, telegraph ahead that you are coming so that they will make\nconnection for you, change at twelve-twenty at Fort Wayne, and I will\nmeet you here. You will find your ticket and a check waiting you at the\nChicago depot. Arrange to remain a week at least. You will be paid all\nexpenses and regular prices for your time. Will you come?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“All right. Make no failure. Good-bye.”\n\nThen the Harvester left an order with the telephone company to run a\nwire to Medicine Woods the first thing in the morning, and drove to the\ndepot to arrange for the ticket and check. In less than an hour he was\nholding the Girl's hands and crooning over her.\n\n“Jerusalem!” said Doctor Carey, rising stiffly. “I'd rather undertake\nto cut off your head and put it back on than to tackle another job like\nthat. She's quite delirious, but she has flashes, and at such times she\nknows whom she wants; the rest of the time it's a jumble and some of it\nis rather gruesome. She's seen dreadful illness, hunger, and there's a\ndebt she's wild about. I told you something was back of this. You've got\nto find out and set her mind at ease.”\n\n“I know all about it,” said the Harvester patiently between crooning\nsentences to the Girl. “But the crash came before I could convince her\nthat it was all right and I could fix everything for her easily. If she\nonly could understand me!”\n\n“Did you find your man?”\n\n“Yes. He will be here this afternoon.”\n\n“Quick work!”\n\n“This takes quick work.”\n\n“Do you know anything about him?”\n\n“Yes. He is a young fellow, just starting out. He is a fine, straight,\nmanly man. I don't know how much he knows, but it will be enough to\nrecognize your ability and standing, and to do what you tell him. I have\nperfect confidence in him. I want you to come back at one, and take my\nplace until I go to meet him.”\n\n“I can bring him out.”\n\n“I have to see him myself. There are a few words to be said before he\nsees the Girl.”\n\n“David, what are you up to?”\n\n“Being as honourable as I can. No man gets any too decent, but there is\nno law against doing as you would be done by, and being as straight as\nyou know how. When I've talked to him, I'll know where I am and I'll\nhave something to say to you.”\n\n“David, I'm afraid----”\n\n“Then what do you suppose I am?” said the Harvester. “It's no use, Doc.\nBe still and take what comes! The manner in which you meet a crisis\nproves you a whining cur or a man. I have got lots of respect for a dog,\nas a dog; but I've none for a man as a dog. If you've gathered from the\nGirl's delirium that I've made a mistake, I hope you have confidence\nenough in me to believe I'll right it, and take my punishment without\nwhining. Go away, you make her worse. Easy, Girl, the world is all right\nand every one is sleeping now, so you should be at rest. With the day\nthe doctor will come, the good doctor you know and like, Ruth. You\nhaven't forgotten your doctor, Ruth? The kind doctor who cared for you.\nHe will make you well, Ruth; well and oh, so happy! Harmon, Harmon,\nDoctor Harmon is coming to you, Girl, and then you will be so happy!”\n\n“Why you blame idiot!” cried Doctor Carey in a harsh whisper. “Have you\nlost all the sense you ever had? Stop that gibber! She wants to hear\nabout the birds and Singing Water. Go on with that woods line of talk;\nshe likes that away the best. This stuff is making her restless. See!”\n\n“You mean you are,” said the Harvester wearily. “Please leave us alone.\nI know the words that will bring comfort. You don't.”\n\nHe began the story all over again, but now there ran through it a\ncontinual refrain. “Your doctor is coming, the good doctor you know. He\nwill make you well and strong, and he will make life so lovely for you.”\n\nHe was talking without pause or rest when Doctor Carey returned in the\nafternoon to take his place. He brought Mrs. Carey with him, and she\ntried a woman's powers of soothing another woman, and almost drove the\nGirl to fighting frenzy. So the doctor made another attempt, and the\nHarvester raced down the hill to the city. He went to the car shed as\nthe train pulled in, and stood at one side while the people hurried\nthrough the gate. He was watching for a young man with a travelling bag\nand perhaps a physician's satchel, who would be looking for some one.\n\n“I think I'll know him,” muttered the Harvester grimly. “I think the\nmasculine element in me will pop up strongly and instinctively at the\nsight of this man who will take my Dream Girl from me. Oh good God! Are\nYou sure You ARE good?”\n\nIn his brown khaki trousers and shirt, his head bare, his bronze face\nlimned with agony he made no attempt to conceal, the Harvester, with\nfeet planted firmly, and tightly folded arms, his head tipped slightly\nto one side, braced himself as he sent his keen gray eyes searching the\ncrowd. Far away he selected his man. He was young, strong, criminally\nhandsome, clean and alert; there was discernible anxiety on his face,\nand it touched the Harvester's soul that he was coming just as swiftly\nas he could force his way. As he passed the gates the Harvester reached\nhis side.\n\n“Doctor Harmon, I think,” he said.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“This way! If you have luggage, I will send for it later.”\n\nThe Harvester hurried to the car.\n\n“Take the shortest cut and cover space,” he said to the driver. The car\nkept to the speed limit until toward the suburbs.\n\nDoctor Harmon removed his hat, ran his fingers through dark waving hair\nand yielded his body to the swing of the car. Neither man attempted to\ntalk. Once the Harvester leaned forward and told the driver to stop\non the bridge, and then sat silently. As the car slowed down, they\nalighted.\n\n“Drive on and tell Doc we are here, and will be up soon,” said the\nHarvester. Then he turned to the stranger. “Doctor Harmon, there's\nlittle time for words. This is my place, and here I grow herbs for\nmedicinal houses.”\n\n“I have heard of you, and heard your stuff recommended,” said the\ndoctor.\n\n“Good!” exclaimed the Harvester. “That saves time. I stopped here to\nmake a required explanation to you. The day you sent Ruth Jameson to\nOnabasha, I saw her leave the train and recognized in her my ideal\nwoman. I lost her in the crowd and it took some time to locate her.\nI found her about a month ago. She was miserable. If you saw what her\nfather did to her and her mother in Chicago, you should have seen what\nhis brother was doing here. The end came one day in my presence, when I\npaid her for ginseng she had found to settle her debt to you. He robbed\nher by force. I took the money from him, and he threatened her. She was\nill then from heat, overwork, wrong food----every misery you can imagine\nheaped upon the dreadful conditions in which she came. It had been my\nintention to court and marry her if I possibly could. That day she had\nnowhere to go; she was wild with fear; the fever that is scorching her\nnow was in her veins then. I did an insane thing. I begged her to marry\nme at once and come here for rest and protection. I swore that if she\nwould, she should not be my wife, but my honoured guest, until she\nlearned to love me and released me from my vow. She tried to tell\nme something; I had no idea it was anything that would make any real\ndifference, and I wouldn't listen. Last night, when the fever was\nbeginning to do its worst, she told me of your entrance into her life\nand what it meant to her. Then I saw that I had made a mistake. You were\nher choice, the man she could love, not me, so I took the liberty of\nsending for you. I want you to cure her, court her, marry her, and make\nher happy. God knows she has had her share of suffering. You recognize\nher as a girl of refinement?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“You grant that in health she would be lovelier than most women, do you\nnot?”\n\n“She was more beautiful than most in sickness and distress.”\n\n“Good!” cried the Harvester. “She has been here two weeks. I give you my\nword, my promise to her has been kept faithfully. As soon as I can leave\nher to attend to it, she shall have her freedom. That will be easy. Will\nyou marry her?”\n\nThe doctor hesitated.\n\n“What is it?” asked the Harvester.\n\n“Well to be frank,” said Doctor Harmon, “it is money! I'm only getting a\nstart. I borrowed funds for my schooling and what I used for her. She is\nin every way attractive enough to be desired by any man, but how am I to\nprovide a home and support her and pay these debts? I'll try it, but I\nam afraid it will be taking her back to wrong conditions again.”\n\n“If you knew that she owned a comfortable cottage in the suburbs, where\nit is cool and clean, and had, say a hundred a month of her own for the\ncoming three years, could you see your way?”\n\n“That would make all the difference in the world. I thought seriously of\nwriting her. I wanted to, but I concluded I'd better work as hard as I\ncould for some practice first, and see if I could make a living for\ntwo, before I tried to start anything. I had no idea she would not be\ncomfortably cared for at her uncle's.”\n\n“I see,” said the Harvester. “If I had kept out, life would have come\nright for her.”\n\n“On the contrary,” said the doctor, “it appears very probable that she\nwould not be living.”\n\n“It is understood between us, then, that you will court and marry her so\nsoon as she is strong enough?”\n\n“It is understood,” agreed the doctor.\n\n“Will you honour me by taking my hand?” asked the Harvester. “I scarcely\nhad hoped to find so much of a man. Now come to your room and get ready\nfor the stiffest piece of work you ever attempted.”\n\nThe Harvester led the way to the guest chamber over looking the lake,\nand installed its first occupant. Then he hurried to the Girl. The\ndoctor was holding her head and one hand, his wife the other, and the\nnurse her feet. It took the Harvester ten strenuous minutes to make his\ntouch and presence known and to work quiet. All over he began crooning\nhis story of rest, joy, and love. He broke off with a few words to\nintroduce Doctor Harmon to the Careys and the nurse, and then calmly\ncontinued while the other men stood and watched him.\n\n“Seems rather cut out for it,” commented Doctor Harmon.\n\n“I never yet have seen him attempt anything that he didn't appear cut\nout for,” answered Doctor Carey.\n\n“Will she know me?” inquired the young man, approaching the bed.\n\nWhen the Girl's eyes fell on him she grew rigid and lay staring at him.\nSuddenly with a wild cry she struggled to rise.\n\n“You have come!” she cried. “Oh I knew you would come! I felt you would\ncome! I cannot pay you now! Oh why didn't you come sooner?”\n\nThe young doctor leaned over and took one of the white hands from the\nHarvester, stroking it gently.\n\n“Why you did pay, Ruth! How did you come to forget? Don't you remember\nthe draft you sent me? I didn't come for money; I came to visit you, to\nnurse you, to do all I can to make you well. I am going to take care of\nyou now so finely you'll be out on the lake and among the flowers soon.\nI've got some medicine that makes every one well. It's going to make you\nstrong, and there's something else that's going to make you happy; and\nme, I'm going to be the proudest man alive.”\n\nHe reached over and took possession of the other hand, stroking them\nsoftly, and the Girl lay tensely staring at him and gradually yielding\nto his touch and voice. The Harvester arose, and passing around the bed,\nhe placed a chair for Doctor Harmon and motioning for Doctor Carey left\nthe room. He went to the shore to his swimming pool, wearily dropped on\nthe bench, and stared across the water.\n\n“Well thank God it worked, anyway!” he muttered.\n\n“What's that popinjay doing here?” thundered Doctor Carey. “Got some\nmedicine that cures everybody. Going to make her well, is he? Make the\ncows, and the ducks, and the chickens, and the shitepokes well, and\nhappy----no name for it! After this we are all going to be well and\nhappy! You look it right now, David! What under Heaven have you done?”\n\n“Left my wife with the man she loves, and to whom I release her, my dear\nfriend,” said the Harvester. “And it's so easy for me that you needn't\ngive making it a little harder, any thought.”\n\n“David, forgive me!” cried Doctor Carey. “I don't understand this. I'm\nalmost insane. Will you tell me what it means?”\n\n“Means that I took advantage of the Girl's illness, utter loneliness,\nand fear, and forced her into marrying me for shelter and care, when she\nloved and wanted another man, who was preparing to come to her. He is\nher Chicago doctor, and fine in every fibre, as you can see. There is\nonly one thing on earth for me to do, and that is to get out of their\nway, and I'll do it as soon as she is well; but I vow I won't leave her\npoor, tired body until she is, not even for him. I thought sure I could\nteach her to love me! Oh but this is bitter, Doc!”\n\n“You are a consummate fool to bring him here!” cried Doctor Carey. “If\nshe is too sick to realize the situation now, she will be different when\nshe is normal again. Any sane girl that wouldn't love you, David, ain't\nfit for anything!”\n\n“Yes, I'm a whale of a lover!” said the Harvester grimly. “Nice mess\nI've made of it. But there is no real harm done. Thank God, Harmon was\nnot the only white man.”\n\n“David, what do you mean?”\n\n“Is it between us, Doc?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“For all time?”\n\n“It is.”\n\nThe Harvester told him. He ended, “Give the fellow his dues, Doc. He had\nher at his mercy, utterly alone and unprotected, in a big city. There\nwas not a living soul to hold him to account. He added to his burdens,\nborrowed more money, and sent her here. He thought she was coming to\nthe country where she would be safe and well cared for until he could\nsupport her. I did the remainder. Now I must undo it, that's all! But\nyou have got to go in there and practise with him. You've got to show\nhim every courtesy of the profession. You must go a little over the\nrules, and teach him all you can. You will have to stifle your feelings,\nand be as much of a man as it is in you to be, at your level best.”\n\n“I'm no good at stifling my feelings!”\n\n“Then you'll have to learn,” said the Harvester. “If you'd lived through\nmy years of repression in the woods you'd do the fellow credit. As I see\nit, his side of this is nearly as fine as you make it. I tell you she\nwas utterly stricken, alone, and beautiful. She sought his assistance.\nWhen the end came he thought only of her. Won't you give a young fellow\nin a place like Chicago some credit for that? Can't you get through you\nwhat it means?”\n\nDoctor Carey stood frowning in deep thought, but the lines of his face\ngradually changed.\n\n“I suppose I've got to stomach him,” he said.\n\nThe nurse came down the gravel path.\n\n“Mr. Langston, Doctor Harmon asked me to call you,” she said.\n\nThe Harvester arose and went to the sunshine room.\n\n“What does he want, Molly?” asked the doctor.\n\n“Wants to turn over his job,” chuckled the nurse. “He held it about\nseven minutes in peace, and then she began to fret and call for the\nHarvester. He just sweat blood to pacify her, but he couldn't make it.\nHe tried to hold her, to make love to her, and goodness knows what, but\nshe struggled and cried, 'David,' until he had to give it up and send\nme.”\n\n“Molly,” said Doctor Carey, “we've known the Harvester a long time, and\nhe is our friend, isn't he?”\n\n“Of course!” said the nurse.\n\n“We know this is the first woman he ever loved, probably ever will, as\nhe is made. Now we don't like this stranger butting in here; we resent\nit, Molly. We are on the side of our friend, and we want him to win.\nI'll grant that this fellow is fine, and that he has done well, but\nwhat's the use in tearing up arrangements already made? And so suitable!\nNow Molly, you are my best nurse, and a good reliable aid in times like\nthis. I gave you instructions an hour ago. I'll add this to them. YOU\nARE ON THE HARVESTER'S SIDE. Do you understand? In this, and the days to\ncome, you'll have a thousand chances to put in a lick with a sick woman.\nPut them in as I tell you.”\n\n“Yes, Doctor Carey.”\n\n“And Molly! You are something besides my best nurse. You're a smashing\npretty girl, and your occupation should make you especially attractive\nto a young doctor. I'm sure this fellow is all right, so while you are\ndoing your best with your patient for the Harvester, why not have a\ntry for yourself with the doctor? It couldn't do any harm, and it might\nstraighten out matters. Anyway, you think it over.”\n\nThe nurse studied his face silently for a time, and then she began to\nlaugh softly.\n\n“He is up there doing his best with her,” she said.\n\nThe doctor threw out his hands in a gesture of disdain, and the nurse\nlaughed again; but her cheeks were pink and her eyes flashing as she\nreturned to duty.\n\n“Random shot, but it might hit something, you never can tell,” commented\nthe doctor.\n\nThe Harvester entered the Girl's room and stood still. She was fretting\nand raising her temperature rapidly. Before he reached the door his\nheart gave one great leap at the sound of her voice calling his name. He\nknew what to do, but he hesitated.\n\n“She seems to have become accustomed to you, and at times does not\nremember me,” said Doctor Harmon. “I think you had better take her again\nuntil she grows quiet.”\n\nThe Harvester stepped to the bed and looked the doctor in the eye.\n\n“I am afraid I left out one important feature in our little talk on the\nbridge,” he said. “I neglected to tell you that in your fight for this\nwoman's life and love you have a rival. I am he. She is my wife, and\nwith the last fibre of my being I adore her. If you win, and she wants\nyou to take her away, I will help you; but my heart goes with her\nforever. If by any chance it should occur that I have been mistaken or\nmisinterpreted her delirium or that she has been deceived and finds\nshe prefers me and Medicine Woods, to you and Chicago, when she has had\nopportunity to measure us man against man, you must understand that\nI claim her. So I say to you frankly, take her if you can, but don't\nimagine that I am passive. I'll help you if I know she wants you, but I\nfight you every inch of the way. Only it has got to be square and open.\nDo you understand?”\n\n“You are certainly sufficiently clear.”\n\n“No man who is half a man sees the last chance of happiness go out of\nhis life without putting up the stiffest battle he knows,” said the\nHarvester grimly. “Ruth-girl, you are raising the fever again. You must\nbe quiet.”\n\nWith infinite tenderness he possessed himself of her hands and began\nstroking her hair, and in a low and soothing voice the story of the\nbirds, flowers, lake, and woods went on. To keep it from growing\nmonotonous the Harvester branched out and put in everything he knew.\nIn the days that followed he held a position none could take from him.\nWhile the doctors fought the fever, he worked for rest and quiet, and\nsoothed the tortured body as best he could, that the medicines might\nact.\n\nBut the fever was stubborn, and the remedies were slow; and long before\nthe dreaded coming day the doctors and nurse were quietly saying to\neach other that when the crisis came the heart would fail. There was no\nvitality to sustain life. But they did not dare tell the Harvester.\nDay and night he sat beside the maple bed or stretched sleeping a\nfew minutes on the couch while the Girl slept; and with faith never\nfaltering and courage unequalled, he warned them to have their remedies\nand appliances ready.\n\n“I don't say it's going to be easy,” he said. “I just merely state that\nit must be done. And I'll also mention that, when the hour comes, the\nman who discovers that he could do something if he had digitalis, or a\nremedy he should have had ready and has forgotten, that man had better\nkeep out of my sight. Make your preparations now. Talk the case over.\nFill your hypodermics. Clean your air pumps. Get your hot-water bottles\nready. Have system. Label your stuff large and set it conveniently. You\nsee what is coming, be prepared!”\n\nOne day, while the Girl lay in a half-drugged, feverish sleep, the\nHarvester went for a swim. He dressed a little sooner than was expected\nand in crossing the living-room he heard Doctor Harmon say to Doctor\nCarey on the veranda, “What are we going to do with him when the end\ncomes?”\n\nThe Harvester stepped to the door. “That won't be the question,” he said\ngrimly. “It will be what will HE do with us?”\n\nThen, with an almost imperceptible movement, he caught Doctor Harmon at\nthe waist line, and lifted and dangled him as a baby, and then stood\nhim on the floor. “Didn't hardly expect that much muscle, did you?” he\ninquired lightly. “And I'm not in what you could call condition, either.\nInstead of wasting any time on fool questions like that, you two go over\nyour stuff and ask each other, have we got every last appliance known\nto physics and surgery? Have we got duplicates on hand in case we break\ndelicate instruments like hypodermic syringes and that sort of thing?\nEngage yourselves with questions pertaining to life; that is your\nbusiness. Instead of planning what you'll do in failure, bolster your\nsouls against it. Granny Moreland beats you two put together in grip and\ncourage.”\n\nThe Harvester returned to his task, and the fight went on. At last the\nhour came when the temperature fell lower and lower. The feeble pulses\nflickered and grew indiscernible; a gray pallor hovered over the Girl,\nand a cold sweat stood on her temples.\n\n“Now!” said the Harvester. “Exercise your calling! Fight like men or\ndevils, but win you must.”\n\nThey did work. They administered stimulants; applied heat to the chilled\nbody; fans swept the room with vitalized air; hypodermics were used; and\nevery last resort known to science was given a full test, and the weak\nheart throbbed slower and slower, and life ran out with each breath. The\nHarvester stood waiting with set jaws. He could detect no change for the\nbetter. At last he picked up a chilled hand and could discover no\npulse, and the gray nails and the dark tips told a story of arrested\ncirculation. He laid down the hand and faced the men.\n\n“This is what you'd call the crisis, Doc?” he asked gently.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Are you stemming it? Are you stemming it? Are you sure she is holding\nher own?”\n\nDoctor Carey looked at him silently.\n\n“Have you done all you can do?” asked the Harvester.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You believe her going out?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe Harvester turned to Doctor Harmon. “Do you concur in that?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThen to the nurse, “And you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then,” said the Harvester, “all of you are useless. Get out of here. I\ndon't want your atmosphere. If you can believe only in death, leave us!\nShe is my wife, and if this is the end she belongs to me, and I will do\nas I choose with her. All of you go!”\n\nThe Harvester stepped to the bathroom door and called Granny Moreland.\n“Granny,” he said, “science has turned tail, and left me in extremity.\nFill your hot-water bottles and come in here with your heart big with\nhope and help me save my Dream Girl. She is breathing Granny; we've got\nto make her keep it up, that's all----just keep her breathing.”\n\nHe returned to the sunshine room, placed a small table beside the bed,\nand on it a glass of water, spoon, and a hypodermic syringe. When Granny\nMoreland came he said: “Now you begin on her feet and rub with long,\nsweeping, upward strokes to drive the blood to her heart.”\n\nAround the Girl he piled hot-water bottles and breathlessly hung over\nher, rubbing her hands. He wiped the perspiration from her forehead, and\nthen dropped by her bed and for a second laid his face on her cold palm.\n\n“If I am wrong, Heaven forgive me,” he prayed. “And you, oh, my darling\nDream Girl, forgive me, but I am forced to try----God helping me! Amen.”\n\nHe arose, took a small bottle from his pocket, filled the spoon with\nwater, and measured into it three drops of liquid as yellow as gold.\nThen he held the spoon to the blue lips, and with his fingers worked\napart the set teeth, and poured the medicine down her throat. Then they\nrubbed and muttered snatches of prayer for fifteen minutes when the\nHarvester administered another three drops. It might have been fancy,\nbut it seemed to him her jaws were not so stiff. Faster flew his hands\nand he sent Granny Moreland to refill the hot bottles. When he gave the\nGirl the third dose he injected some of the liquid over her heart and of\nthe glycerine the doctors had left, in the extremities. He released more\nair and began rubbing again.\n\nThe second hour started in the same way, and ended with slowly relaxing\nmuscles and faint tinges of colour in the white cheeks. The feet were\nnot so cold, and when the Harvester held the spoon he knew that the\nGirl made an effort to swallow, and he could see her eyelids tremble.\nThereupon he pointed these signs to Granny, and implored her to rub and\npray, and pray and rub, while he worked until the perspiration rolled\ndown his gray face. At the end of the second hour he began decreasing\nthe doses and shortening the time, and again he commenced in a\nlow rumble his song of life and health, to encourage the Girl as\nconsciousness returned.\n\nOccasionally Doctor Carey opened the door slightly and peeped in to see\nif he were wanted, but he received no invitation to enter. The last\ntime he left with the impression that the Harvester was raving, while\nhe worked over a lifeless body. He had the Girl warmly covered and bent\nover her face and hands. At her feet crouched Granny Moreland, rubbing,\nstill rubbing, beneath the covers, while in a steady stream the\nHarvester was pouring out his song. If he had listened an instant longer\nhe would have recognized that the tone and the words had changed. Now it\nwas, “Gently, breathe gently, Girl! Slowly, steadily, easily! Deeper, a\nlittle deeper, Ruth! Brave Girl, never another so wonderful! That's my\nDream Girl coming from the shadows, coming to life's sunshine, coming to\nhope, coming to love! Deeper, just a little deeper! Smoothly and evenly!\nYou are making it, Girl! You are making it! By all that is holy and\nglorious! Stick to it, Ruth, hold tight to me! I'll help you, dear! You\nare coming, coming back to life and love. Don't worry yourself trying\ntoo hard, if only you can send every breath as deeply as the last one,\nyou can make it. You brave girl! You wonderful Dream Girl! Ah, Ruth, the\nname of this is victory!”\n\nAn hour before Doctor Carey had said to Doctor Harmon and the nurse,\nas he softly closed the door: “It is over and the Harvester is raving.\nWe'll give him a little more time and see if he won't realize it\nhimself. That will be easier for him than for us to try to tell him.”\n\nNow he opened the door, stared a second, and coming to the opposite side\nof the bed, he leaned over the Girl. Then he felt her feet. They were\nwarm and slightly damp. A surprised look crept over his face. He gently\nreached for a hand that the Harvester yielded to him. It was warm,\nthe blue tips becoming rosy, the wrist pulse discernible. Then he bent\ncloser, touched her face, and saw the tremulous eyelids. He turned back\nthe cover, and held his ear over her heart. When he straightened, “As\nGod lives, she's got a chance, David!” he exulted in an awed whisper.\n\nThe Harvester lifted a graven face, down which the sweat of agony\nrolled, and his lips parted in a twitching smile. “Then this is where\nlove beats the doctors, Carey!” he said.\n\n“It is where love has ventured what science dares not. Love didn't do\nall of this. In the name of the Almighty, what did you give her, David?”\n\n“Life!” cried the Harvester. “Life! Come on, Ruth, come on! Out of the\nvalley come to me! You are well now, Girl! It's all over! The last trace\nof fever is gone, the last of the dull ache. Can you swallow just two\nmore drops of bottled sunshine, Ruth?”\n\nThe flickering lids slowly opened, and the big black eyes looked\nstraight into the Harvester's. He met them steadily, smiling\nencouragement.\n\n“Hang on to each breath, dear heart!” he urged. “The fever is gone. The\npain is over! Long life and the love you crave are for you. You've only\nto keep breathing a few more hours and the battle is yours. Glorious\nGirl! Noble! You are doing finely! Ruth, do you know me?”\n\nHer lips moved.\n\n“Don't try to speak,” said the Harvester. “Don't waste breath on a word.\nSave the good oxygen to strengthen your tired body. But if you do know\nme, maybe you could smile, Ruth!”\n\nShe could just smile, and that was all. Feeble, flickering, transient,\nbut as it crossed the living face the Harvester lifted her hands and\nkissed them over and over, back, palm, and finger tips.\n\n“Now just one more drop, honey, and then a long rest. Will you try it\nagain for me?”\n\nShe assented, and the Harvester took the bottle from his pocket, poured\nthe drop, and held the spoon to willing lips. The big eyes were on him\nwith a question. Then they fell to the spoon. The Harvester understood.\n\n“Yes, it's mine! It's got sixty years of wonderful life in it, every one\nof them full of love and happiness for my dear Dream Girl. Can you take\nit, Ruth?”\n\nHer lips parted, the wine of life passed between. She smiled faintly,\nand her eyelids dropped shut, but presently they opened again.\n\n“David!”\n\n“My Dream Girl!”\n\n“Harvester?”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“Medicine Man?”\n\n“Don't, Ruth! Save every breath to help your heart.”\n\n“Life?”\n\n“Life it is, Girl!” exulted the Harvester. “Long life! Love! Home! The\nman you love! Every happiness that ever came to a girl! Nothing shall be\ndenied you! Nothing shall be lacking! It's all in your hands now, Ruth.\nWe've all done everything we can; you must do the remainder. It's your\nwork to send every breath as deeply as you can. Doc, release another\ntank of air. Are her feet warm, Granny? Let the nurse take your place\nnow. And, honey, go to sleep! I'll keep watch for you. I'll measure\neach breath you draw. If they shorten or weaken, I'll wake you for more\nmedicine. You can trust me! Always you can trust me, Ruth.”\n\nThe Girl smiled and fell into a light, even slumber. Granny Moreland\nstumbled to the couch and rolled on it sobbing with nervous exhaustion.\nDoctor Carey called the nurse to take her place. Then he came to the\nHarvester's side and whispered, “Let me, David!”\n\nThe Harvester looked up with his queer grin, but he made no motion to\narise.\n\n“Won't you trust me, David? I'll watch as if it were my own wife.”\n\n“I wouldn't trust any man on earth, for the coming three hours,” replied\nthe Harvester. “If I keep this up that long, she is safe. Go and rest\nuntil I call you.”\n\nHe again bent over the Girl, one hand on her left wrist, the other over\nher heart, his eyes on her lips, watching the depth and strength of her\nevery breath. Regularly he administered the medicine he was giving her.\nSometimes she took it half asleep; again she gave him a smile that to\nthe Harvester was the supreme thing of earth or Heaven. Toward the end\nof the long vigil, in exhaustion he slipped to the floor, and laid his\nhead on the side of the bed, and for a second his hand relaxed and he\nfell asleep. The Girl awakened as his touch loosened and looking down\nshe saw his huddled body. A second later the Harvester awoke with a\nguilty start to find her fingers twisted in the shock of hair on the top\nof his head.\n\n“Poor stranded Girl,” he muttered. “She's clinging to me for life, and\nyou can stake all you are worth she's going to get it!”\n\nThen he gently relaxed her grip, gave her the last dose he felt\nnecessary, yielded his place to Doctor Carey and staggered up the hill.\nAs the sun peeped over Medicine Woods he stretched himself between the\ntwo mounds under the oak, and for a few minutes his body was rent with\nthe awful, torn sobbing of a strong man. Belshazzar nosed the twisting\nfigure and whined pitifully. A chattering little marsh wren tilted on a\nbush and scolded. A blue jay perched above and tried to decide whether\nthere was cause for an alarm signal. A snake coming from the water to\nhunt birds ran close to him, and changing its course, went weaving away\namong the mosses. Gradually the pent forces spent themselves, and for\nhours the Harvester lay in the deep sleep of exhaustion, and stretched\nbeside him, Belshazzar guarded with anxious dog eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE BETTER MAN\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon the Harvester arose and went into the\nlake, ate a hearty dinner, and then took up his watch again. For two\ndays and nights he kept his place, until he had the Girl out of danger,\nand where careful nursing was all that was required to insure life\nand health. As he sat beside her the last day, his physical endurance\nstrained to the breaking point, she laid her hand over his, and looked\nlong and steadily into his eyes.\n\n“There are so many things I want to know,” she said.\n\nThe Harvester's firm fingers closed over hers. “Ruth, have you ever been\nsorry that you trusted me?”\n\n“Never!” said the Girl instantly.\n\n“Then suppose you keep it up,” said he. “Whatever it is that you want\nto know, don't use an iota of strength to talk or to think about it now.\nJust say to yourself, he loves me well enough to do what is right, and\nI know that he will. All you have to do is to be patient until you grow\nstronger than you ever have been in your life, and then you shall have\nexactly what you want, Ruth. Sleep like a baby for a week or two. Then,\nslowly and gradually, we will build up such a constitution for you that\nyou shall ride, drive, row, swim, dance, play, and have all that your\ngirlhood has missed in fun and frolic, and all that your womanhood\ncraves in love and companionship. Happiness has come at last, Ruth. Take\nit from me. Everything you crave is yours. The love you want, the home,\nand the life. As soon as you are strong enough, you shall know all about\nit. Your business is to drink stimulants and sleep now, dear.”\n\n“So tired of this bed!”\n\n“It won't be long until you can lie on the couch and the veranda swing\nagain.”\n\n“Glory!” said the Girl. “David, I must have been full of fever for a\nlong time. I can't remember everything.”\n\n“Don't try, I tell you. Life is coming out right for you; that's all you\nneed know now.”\n\n“And for you, David?”\n\n“Whenever things are right for you, they are for me, Ruth.”\n\n“Don't you ever think of yourself?”\n\n“Not when I am close you.”\n\n“Ah! Then I shall have to grow strong very soon and think of you.”\n\nThe Harvester's smile was pathetic. He was unspeakably tired again.\n\n“Never mind me!” he said. “Only get well.”\n\n“David, was there a little horse?”\n\n“There certainly was and is,” said the Harvester.\n\n“You had not named him yet, but in a few days I can lead him to the\nwindow.”\n\n“Was there something said about a boat?”\n\n“Two of them.”\n\n“Two?”\n\n“Yes. A row boat for you, and a launch that will take you all over the\nlake with only the exertion of steering on your part.”\n\n“David, I want my pendant and ring. I am so tired of lying here, I want\nto play with them.”\n\n“Where do you keep them, Ruth?”\n\n“In the willow teapot. I thought no one would look there.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed and brought the little boxes. He had to open them,\nbut the Girl put on the ring and asked him if he would not help her with\nthe pendant. He slipped the thread around her neck and clasped it. With\na sigh of satisfaction she took the ornament in one hand and closed her\neyes. He thought she was falling asleep, but presently she looked at\nhim.\n\n“You won't allow them to take it from me?”\n\n“Indeed no! There is no reason on earth why you should not have that\nthread around your neck if you want it.”\n\n“I am going to sleep now. I want two things. May I have them?”\n\n“You may,” said the Harvester promptly, “provided they are not to eat.”\n\n“No,” said the Girl. “I've suffered and made others trouble. I won't\nbother you by asking for anything more than is brought me. This is\ndifferent. You are completely worn out. Your face frightens me, David,\nand white hairs that were not there a few days ago have come along your\ntemples. I can see them.”\n\n“You gave me a mighty serious scare, Ruth.”\n\n“I know,” said the Girl. “Forgive me. I didn't mean to. I want you to\nleave me to Doctor Harmon and the nurse and go sleep a week. Then I\nwill be ready for the swing, and to hear some more about the trees and\nbirds.”\n\n“I can keep it up if you really need me, but if you don't I am sleepy.\nSo, if you feel safe, I think I will go.”\n\n“Oh I am safe enough,” said the Girl. “It isn't that. I'm so lonely.\nI've made up my mind not to grieve for mother, but I miss her so now. I\nfeel so friendless.”\n\n“But, honey,” said the Harvester, “you mustn't do that! Don't you see\nhow all of us love you? Here is Granny shutting up her house and living\nhere, just to be with you. The nurse will do anything you say. Here is\nthe man you know best, and think so much of, staying in the cabin, and\nso happy to give you all his time, and anything else you will have,\ndear. And the Careys come every day, and will do their best to comfort\nyou, and always I am here for you to fall back on.”\n\n“Yes, I'm falling right now,” said the Girl. “I almost wish I had the\nfever again. No one has touched me for days. I feel as if every one was\nafraid of me.”\n\nThe Harvester was puzzled.\n\n“Well, Ruth, I'm doing the best I know,” he said. “What is it you want?”\n\n“Nothing!” answered the Girl with slightly dejected inflection. “Say\ngood-bye to me, and go sleep your week. I'll be very good, and then you\nshall take me a drive up the hill when you awaken. Won't that be fine?”\n\n“Say good-bye to me!” She felt a “little lonely!” They all acted as if\nthey were “afraid” of her. The Harvester indulged in a flashing mental\nreview and arrived at a decision. He knelt beside the bed, took both\nslender, cool hands and covered them with kisses. Then he slid a hand\nunder the pillow and raised the tired head.\n\n“If I am to say good-bye, I have to do it in my own way, Ruth,” he said.\n\nThereupon he began at the tumbled mass of hair and kissed from her\nforehead to her lips, kisses warm and tender.\n\n“Now you go to sleep, and grow strong enough by the time I come back to\ntell me whom you love,” he said, and went from the room without waiting\nfor any reply.\n\nWith short intervals for food and dips in the lake the Harvester very\nnearly slept the week. When he finally felt himself again, he bathed,\nshaved, dressed freshly, and went to see the Girl. He had to touch her\nto be sure she was real. She was extremely weak and tremulous, but her\nface and hands were fuller, her colour was good, she was ravenously\nhungry. Doctor Harmon said she was a little tryant, and the nurse that\nshe was plain cross. The first thing the Harvester noticed was that the\ndull blue look in the depth of the dark eyes was gone. They were clear,\ndusky wells, with shining lights at the bottom.\n\n“Well I never would have believed it!” he cried. “Doctor Harmon, you\nare a great physician! You have made her all over new, and in a few more\ndays she will be on the veranda. This is great!”\n\n“Do I appear so much better to you, Harvester?” asked the Girl.\n\n“Has no one thought to show you,” cried the Harvester. “Here, let me!”\n\nHe stepped to her dressing table, picked up a mirror, and held it before\nher so that she could see herself.\n\n“Seems to me I am dreadfully white and thin yet!”\n\n“If you had seen what I saw ten days ago, my Girl, you would think you\nappear like a pink, rosy angel now, or a wonderful dream.”\n\n“Truly, do I in the least resemble a dream, David?”\n\n“You are a dream. The loveliest one a man ever had. With three months of\nright care and exercise you'll be the beautiful woman nature intended.\nI'm so proud of you. You are being so brave! Just lie there in patience\na few more days, and out you come again to life; and life that will\nthrill your being with joy.”\n\n“All right,” said the Girl, “I will. David are you attending to your\nherbs?”\n\n“Not for a few weeks.”\n\n“You are very much behind?”\n\n“No. Nothing important. I don't make enough to count on what is ready\nnow. I can soon gather jimson leaves and seed to fill orders, the\nhemlock is about right to take the fruit, the mustard is yet in pod, and\nthe saffron and wormseed can be attended later. I can catch up in two\ndays.”\n\n“What about----about the big bed on the hill?”\n\nThe Harvester experienced an inward thrill of delight. She was so\nimpressed with the value of the ginseng she would not mention it,\neven before the man she loved----no more than that----“adored”----\n“worshipped!” He smiled at her in understanding.\n\n“I'll have to take a peep at that and report,” he said.\n\n“Are you rested now?”\n\n“Indeed yes!”\n\n“You are dreadfully thin.”\n\n“I always am. I'll pick up a little when I get back to work.”\n\n“David, I want you to go to work now.”\n\n“Can you spare me?”\n\n“Haven't we done well these last few days?”\n\n“I can't tell you how well.”\n\n“Then please go gather everything you need to fill orders except the big\nbed, and by that time maybe you could take another week off, and I could\ngo to the hill top and on the lake. I'm so anxious to put my feet on the\nearth. They feel so dead.”\n\n“Are your feet well rubbed to draw down the circulation?”\n\n“They are rubbed shiny and almost skinned, David. No one ever had better\ncare, of that I am sure. Go gather what you should have.”\n\n“All right,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe arose and as he started to leave the room he took one last look at\nthe Girl to see if he could detect anything he could suggest for\nher comfort, and read a message in her eyes. Instantly there was an\nanswering flash in his.\n\n“I'll be back in a minute,” he said. “I just noticed discorea villosa\nhas the finest rattle boxes formed. I've been waiting to show you. And\nthe hop tree has its castanets all green and gold. In a few more weeks\nit will begin to play for you. I'll bring you some.”\n\nSoon he returned with the queer seed formations, and as he bent above\nher, with his back to Doctor Harmon, he whispered, “What is it?”\n\nHer lips barely formed the one word, “Hurry!”\n\nThe Harvester straightened.\n\n“All comfortable, Ruth?” he asked casually.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You understand, of course, that there is not the slightest necessity\nfor my going to work if you really want me for anything, even if it's\nnothing more than to have me within calling distance, in case you SHOULD\nwant something. The whole lot I can gather now won't amount to twenty\ndollars. It's merely a matter of pride with me to have what is called\nfor. I'd much rather remain, if you can use me in any way at all.”\n\n“Twenty dollars is considerable, when expenses are as heavy as now. And\nit's worth more than any money to you not to fail when orders come. I\nhave learned that, and David, I don't want you to either. You must\nfill all demands as usual. I wouldn't forgive myself this winter if you\nshould be forced to send orders only partly filled because I fell ill\nand hindered you. Please go and gather all you possibly will need of\neverything you take at this season, only remember!”\n\n“There is no danger of my forgetting. If you are going to send me away\nto work, you will allow me to kiss your hand before I go, fair lady?”\n\nHe did it fervently.\n\n“One word with you, Harmon,” he said as he left the room.\n\nDoctor Harmon arose and followed him to the gold garden, and together\nthey stood beside the molten hedge of sunflowers, coneflowers,\nelecampane, and jewel flower.\n\n“I merely want to mention that this is your inning,” said the Harvester.\n“Find out if you are essential to the Girl's happiness as soon as you\ncan, and the day she tells me so, I will file her petition and take a\ntrip to the city to study some little chemical quirks that bother me.\nThat's all.”\n\nThe Harvester went to the dry-house for bags and clipping shears, and\nthe doctor returned to the sunshine room.\n\n“Ruth,” he said, “do you know that the Harvester is the squarest man I\never met?”\n\n“Is he?” asked the Girl.\n\n“He is! He certainly is!”\n\n“You must remember that I have little acquaintance with men,” said she.\n“You are the first one I ever knew, and the only one except him.”\n\n“Well I try to be square,” said Doctor Harmon, “but that is where\nLangston has me beaten a mile. I have to try. He doesn't. He was born\nthat way.”\n\nThe Girl began to laugh.\n\n“His environment is so different,” she said. “Perhaps if he were in a\nbig city, he would have to try also.”\n\n“Won't do!” said the doctor. “He chose his location. So did I. He is a\nstronger physical man than I ever was or ever will be. The struggle\nthat bound him to the woods and to research, that made him the master\nof forces that give back life, when a man like Carey says it is the\nend, proves him a master. The tumult in his soul must have been like a\ncyclone in his forest, when he turned his back on the world and stuck to\nthe woods. Carey told me about it. Some day you must hear. It's a story\na woman ought to know in order to arrive at proper values. You never\nwill understand the man until you know that he is clean where most of\nus are blackened with ugly sins we have no right on God's footstool to\ncommit and not so much reason as he. Every man should be as he is, but\nvery few are. Carey says Langston's mother was a wonderful element in\nthe formation of his character; but all mothers are anxious, and none of\nthem can build with no foundation and no soul timber. She had material\nfor a man to her hand, or she couldn't have made one.”\n\n“I see what you mean.”\n\n“So far as any inexperienced girl ever sees,” said the doctor. “Some day\nif you live to fifty you will know, but you can't comprehend it now.”\n\n“If you think I lived all my life in Chicago's poverty spots and don't\nknow unbridled human nature!”\n\n“I found you and your mother unusually innocent women. You may\nunderstand some things. I hope you do. It will help you to decide who is\nthe real man among the men who come into your life. There are some men,\nRuth, who are fit to mate with a woman, and to perpetuate themselves and\ntheir mental and moral forces in children, who will be like them, and\nthere are others who are not. It is these 'others' who are responsible\nfor the sin of the world, the sickness and suffering. Any time you are\nsure you have a chance at a moral man, square and honest, in control of\nhis brain and body, if you are a wise woman, Ruth, stick to him as the\nlimpet to the rock.”\n\n“You mean stick to the Harvester?”\n\n“If you are a wise woman!”\n\n“When was a woman ever wise?”\n\n“A few have been. They are the only care-free, really happy ones of the\nworld, the only wives without a big, poison, blue-bottle fly in their\nointment.”\n\n“I detest flies!” said the Girl.\n\n“So do I,” said the doctor. “For this reason I say to you choose the\nointment that never had one in it. Take the man who is 'master of his\nfate, captain of his soul.' Stick to the Harvester! He is infinitely the\nbetter man!”\n\n“Well have you seen anything to indicate that I wasn't sticking?” asked\nthe Girl.\n\n“No. And for your sake I hope I never will.”\n\nShe laughed softly.\n\n“You do love him, Ruth?”\n\n“As I did my mother, yes. There is not a trace in my heart of the thing\nhe calls love.”\n\n“You have been stunted, warped, and the fountains of life never have\nopened. It will come with right conditions of living.”\n\n“Do you think so?”\n\n“I know so. At least there is no one else you love, Ruth?”\n\n“No one except you.”\n\n“And do you feel about me just as you do him?”\n\n“No! It is different. What I owe him is for myself. What I owe you is\nfor my mother. You saw! You know! You understand what you did for her,\nand what it meant to me. The Harvester must be the finest man on earth,\nbut when I try to think of either God or Heaven, your face intervenes.”\n\n“That's all right, Ruth, I'm so glad you told me,” said Doctor Harmon.\n“I can make it all perfectly clear to you. You just go on and worship me\nall you please. It's bound to make a cleaner, better man of me. What you\nfeel for me will hold me to a higher moral level all my life than I ever\nhave known before; but never forget that you are not going to live in\nHeaven. You will be here at least sixty years yet, so when you come to\nthink of selecting a partner for the relations of the world, you stick\nto the finest man on earth; see?”\n\n“I do!” said the Girl. “I saw you kiss Molly a week ago. She is lovely,\nand I hope you will be perfectly happy. It won't interfere with my\nworshipping you; not the least in the world. Go ahead and be joyful!”\n\nThe doctor sprang to his feet in crimson confusion. The Girl lay and\nlaughed at him.\n\n“Don't!” she cried. “It's all right! It takes a weight off my soul as\nheavy as a mountain. I do adore you, as I said. But every hour since I\nleft Chicago a big, black cloud has hung over me. I didn't feel free.\nI didn't feel absolved. I felt that my obligations to you were so heavy\nthat when I had settled the last of the money debt I was in honour\nbound----”\n\n“Don't, Ruth! Forget those dreadful times, as I told you then! Think\nonly of a happy future!”\n\n“Let me finish,” said the Girl. “Let me get this out of my system with\nthe other poison. From the day I came here, I've whispered in my heart,\n'I am not free!' But if you love another woman! If you are going to\ntake her to your heart and to your lips, why that is my release. Oh Man,\nspeak the words! Tell me I am free indeed!”\n\n“Ruth, be quiet, for mercy sake! You'll raise a temperature, and the\nHarvester will pitch me into the lake. You are free, child, of course!\nYou always have been. I understood the awful pressure that was on you\nwith the very first glimpse I had of your mother. Who was she, Ruth?”\n\n“She never would tell me.”\n\n“She thought you would appeal to her people?”\n\n“She knew I would! I couldn't have helped it.”\n\n“Would you like to know?”\n\n“I never want to. It is too late. I infinitely prefer to remain in\nignorance. Talk of something else.”\n\n“Let me read a wonderful book I found on the Harvester's shelves.”\n\n“Anything there will contain wonders, because he only buys what appeals\nto him, and it takes a great book to do that. I am going to learn. He\nwill teach me, and when I come within comprehending distance of him,\nthen we are going on together.”\n\n“What an attractive place this is!”\n\n“Isn't it? I only have seen enough to understand the plan. I scarcely\ncan wait to set my feet on earth and go into detail. Granny Moreland\nsays that when spring comes over the hill, and brings up the flowers in\nthe big woods, she'd rather walk through them than to read Revelation.\nShe says it gives her an idea of Heaven she can come closer realizing\nand it seems more stable. You know she worries about the foundations.\nShe can't understand what supports Heaven. But up there in Medicine\nWoods the old dear gets so close her God that some day she is going to\nrealize that her idea of Heaven there is quite as near right as marble\nstreets and gold pillars and vastly more probable. The day I reach that\nhill top again, Heaven begins for me. Do you know the wonderful thing\nthe Harvester did up there?”\n\n“Under the oak?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Carey told me. It was marvellous.”\n\n“Not such a marvel as another the doctor couldn't have known. The\nHarvester made passing out so natural, so easy, so a part of elemental\nforces, that I almost have forgotten her tortured body. When I think of\nher now, it is to wonder if next summer I can distinguish her whisper\namong the leaves. Before you go, I'll take you up there and tell you\nwhat he says, and show you what he means, and you will feel it also.”\n\n“What if I shouldn't go?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Doctor Carey has offered me a splendid position in his hospital. There\nwould be work all day, instead of waiting all day in the hope of working\nan hour. There would be a living in it for two from the word go. There\nwould be better air, longer life, more to be got out of it, and if I can\nmake good, Carey's work to take up as he grows old.”\n\n“Take it! Take it quickly!” cried the Girl. “Don't wait a minute! You\nmight wear out your heart in Chicago for twenty years or forever, and\nnot have an opportunity to do one half so much good. Take it at once!”\n\n“I was waiting to learn what you and Langston would say.”\n\n“He will say take it.”\n\n“Then I will be too happy for words. Ruth, you have not only paid the\ndebt, but you have brought me the greatest joy a man ever had. And there\nis no need to wait the ages I thought I must. He can tell in a year if I\ncan do the work, and I know I can now; so it's all settled, if Langston\nagrees.”\n\n“He will,” said the Girl. “Let me tell him!”\n\n“I wish you would,” said the doctor. “I don't know just how to go at\nit.”\n\nThen for two days the Harvester and Belshazzar gathered herbs and spread\nthem on the drying trays. On the afternoon of the third, close three,\nthe doctor came to the door.\n\n“Langston,” he said, “we have a call for you. We can't keep Ruth quiet\nmuch longer. She is tired. We want to change her bed completely. She\nwon't allow either of us to lift her. She says we hurt her. Will you\ncome and try it?”\n\n“You'll have to give me time to dip and rub off and get into clean\nclothing,” he said. “I've been keeping away, because I was working on\ntime, and I smell to strangulation of stramonium and saffron.”\n\n“Can't give you ten seconds,” said the doctor. “Our temper is getting\nbrittle. We are cross as the proverbial fever patient. If you don't come\nat once we will imagine you don't want to, and refuse to be moved at\nall.”\n\n“Coming!” cried the Harvester, as he plunged his hands in the wash bowl\nand soused his face. A second later he appeared on the porch.\n\n“Ruth,” he said, “I am steeped in the odours of the dry-house. Can't you\nwait until I bathe and dress?”\n\n“No, I can't,” said a fretful voice. “I can't endure this bed another\nminute.”\n\n“Then let Doctor Harmon lift you. He is so fresh and clean.”\n\nThe Harvester glanced enviously at the shaven face and white trousers\nand shirt of the doctor.\n\n“I just hate fresh, clean men. I want to smell herbs. I want to put my\nfeet in the dirt and my hands in the water.”\n\nThe Harvester came at a rush. He brought a big easy chair from the\nliving-room, straightened the cover, and bent above the Girl. He picked\nher up lightly, gently, and easing her to his body settled in the chair.\nShe laid her face on his shoulder, and heaved a deep sigh of content.\n\n“Be careful with my back, Man,” she said. “I think my spine is almost\nworn through.”\n\n“Poor girl,” said the Harvester. “That bed should be softer.”\n\n“It should not!” contradicted the Girl. “It should be much harder. I'm\ntired of soft beds. I want to lie on the earth, with my head on a root;\nand I wish it would rain dirt on me. I am bathed threadbare. I want to\nbe all streaky.”\n\n“I understand,” said the Harvester. “Harmon, bring me a pad and pencil\na minute, I must write an order for some things I want. Will you call up\ntown and have them sent out immediately?”\n\nOn the pad he wrote: “Telephone Carey to get the highest grade\ncurled-hair mattress, a new pad, and pillow, and bring them flying in\nthe car. Call Granny and the girl and empty the room. Clean, air, and\nfumigate it thoroughly. Arrange the furniture differently, and help me\ninto the living-room with Ruth.” He handed the pad to the doctor.\n\n“Please attend to that,” he said, and to the Girl: “Now we go on a\njourney. Doc, you and Molly take the corners of the rug we are on and\nslide us into the other room until you get this aired and freshened.”\n\nIn the living-room the Girl took one long look at the surroundings\nand suddenly relaxed. She cuddled against the Harvester and lifting a\ntremulous white hand, drew it across his unshaven cheek.\n\n“Feels so good,” she said. “I'm sick and tired of immaculate men.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed, tucked her feet in the cover and held her\ntenderly. The Girl lay with her cheek against the rough khaki, palpitant\nwith the excitement of being moved.\n\n“Isn't it great?” she panted.\n\nHe caught the hand that had touched his cheek in a tender grip, and\nlaughed a deep rumble of exultation that came from the depths of his\nheart.\n\n“There's no name for it, honey,” he said. “But don't try to talk until\nyou have a long rest. Changing positions after you have lain so long may\nbe making unusual work for your heart. Am I hurting your back?”\n\n“No,” said the Girl. “This is the first time I have been comfortable in\nages. Am I tiring you?”\n\n“Yes,” laughed the Harvester. “You are almost as heavy as a large sack\nof leaves, but not quite equal to a bridge pillar or a log. Be sure to\nthink of that, and worry considerably. You are in danger of straining my\nmuscles to the last degree, my heart included.”\n\n“Where is your heart?” whispered the Girl.\n\n“Right under your cheek,” answered the Harvester. “But for Heaven's\nsake, don't intimate that you are taking any interest in it, or it will\ngo to pounding until your head will bounce. It's one member of my body\nthat I can't control where you are concerned.”\n\n“I thought you didn't like me any more.”\n\n“Careful!” warned the Harvester. “You are yet too close Heaven to fib\nlike that, Ruth. What have I done to indicate that I don't love you more\nthan ever?”\n\n“Stayed away nearly every minute for three awful days, and wouldn't come\nwithout being dragged; and now you're wishing they would hurry and fix\nthat bed, so you can put me down and go back to your rank old herbs\nagain.”\n\n“Well of all the black prevarications! I went when you sent me, and\ncame when you called. I'd willingly give up my hope of what Granny calls\n'salvation' to hold you as I am for an hour, and you know it.”\n\n“It's going to be much longer than that,” said the Girl nestling to him.\n“I asked for you because you never hurt me, and they always do. I knew\nyou were so strong that my weight now wouldn't be a load for one of your\nhands, and I am not going back to that bed until I am so tired that I\nwill be glad to lie down.”\n\nFor a long time she was so silent the Harvester thought her going to\nsleep; and having learned that for him joy was probably transient, he\ndeliberately got all he could. He closely held the hand she had not\nwithdrawn, and often lifted it to his lips. Sometimes he stroked the\nheavy braid, gently ran his hands across the tired shoulders, or eased\nher into a different position. There was not a doubt in his mind of one\nthing. He was having a royal, good time, and he was thankful for the\nwork he had set his assistants that kept them out of the room. They\nseemed in no hurry, and from scuffling, laughing, and a steady stream of\ntalk, they were entertained at least. At last the Girl roused.\n\n“There is something I want to ask you,” she said. “I promised Doctor\nHarmon I would.”\n\nInstantly the heart of the Harvester gave a leap that jarred the head\nresting on it.\n\n“You don't like him?” questioned the Girl.\n\n“I do!” declared the Harvester. “I like him immensely. There is not a\nfine, manly good-looking feature about him that I have missed. I don't\nfail to do him justice on every point.”\n\n“I'm so glad! Then you will want him to remain.”\n\n“Here?” asked the Harvester with a light, hot breath.\n\n“In Onabasha! Doctor Carey has offered him the place of chief assistant\nat the hospital. There is a good salary and the chance of taking up\nthe doctor's work as he grows older. It means plenty to do at once,\nhealthful atmosphere, congenial society----everything to a young man.\nHe only had a call once in a while in Chicago, often among people who\nreceived more than they paid, like me, and he was very lonely. I think\nit would be great for him.”\n\n“And for you, Ruth?”\n\n“It doesn't make the least difference to me; but for his sake, because I\nthink so much of him, I would like to see him have the place.”\n\n“You still think so much of him, Ruth?”\n\n“More, if possible,” said the Girl. “Added to all I owed him before, he\nhas come here and worked for days to save me, and it wasn't his fault\nthat it took a bigger man. Nothing alters the fact that he did all he\ncould, most graciously and gladly.”\n\n“What do you mean, Ruth?” stammered the Harvester.\n\n“Oh they have worn themselves out!” cried the Girl impatiently. “First,\nGranny Moreland told me every least little detail of how I went out, and\nyou resurrected me. I knew what she said was true, because she worked\nwith you. Then Doctor Carey told me, and Mrs. Carey, and Doctor Harmon,\nand Molly, and even Granny's little assistant has left the kitchen to\ntell me that I owe my life to you, and all of them might as well have\nsaved breath. I knew all the time that if ever I came out of this, and\nhad a chance to be like other women, it would be your work, and I'm glad\nit is. I'd hate to be under obligations to some people I know; but I\nfeel honoured to be indebted to you.”\n\n“I'm mighty sorry they worried you. I had no idea----”\n\n“They didn't 'worry,' me! I am just telling you that I knew it all the\ntime; that's all!”\n\n“Forget that!” said the Harvester. “Come back to our subject. What was\nit you wanted, dear?”\n\n“To know if you have any objections to Doctor Harmon remaining in\nOnabasha?”\n\n“Certainly not! It will be a fine thing for him.”\n\n“Will it make any difference to you in any way?”\n\n“Ruth, that's probing too deep,” said the Harvester.\n\n“I don't see why!”\n\n“I'm glad of it!”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I'd least rather show my littleness to you than to any one else on\nearth.”\n\n“Then you have some feeling about it?”\n\n“Perhaps a trifle. I'll get over it. Give me a little time to adjust\nmyself. Doctor Harmon shall have the place, of course. Don't worry about\nthat!”\n\n“He will be so happy!”\n\n“And you, Ruth?”\n\n“I'll be happy too!”\n\n“Then it's all right,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe laid down her hand, drew the cover over it, and slightly shifted her\nposition to rest her. The door opened, and Doctor Harmon announced that\nthe room was ready. It was shining and fresh. The bed was now turned\nwith its head to the north, so that from it one could see the big\ntrees in Medicine Woods, the sweep of the hillside, the sparkle of\nmallow-bordered Singing Water, the driveway and the gold flower\ngarden. Everything was so changed that the room had quite a different\nappearance. The instant he laid her on it the Girl said, “This bed is\nnot mine.”\n\n“Yes it is,” said the Harvester. “You see, we were a little excited\nsometimes, and we spilled a few quarts of perfectly good medicine on\nyour mattress. It was hopelessly smelly and ruined; so I am going to\ncremate it and this is your splinter new one and a fresh pad and\npillow. Now you try them and see if they are not much harder and more\ncomfortable.”\n\n“This is just perfect!” she sighed, as she sank into the bed.\n\nThe Harvester bent over her to straighten the cover, when suddenly\nshe reached both arms around his neck, and gripped him with all her\nstrength.\n\n“Thank you!” she said.\n\n“May I hold you to-morrow?” whispered the Harvester, emboldened by this.\n\n“Please do,” said the Girl.\n\nThe Harvester, with dog to heel, went to the oak to think.\n\n“Belshazzar, kommen Sie!” said the man, dropping on the seat and holding\nout his hand. The dog laid his muzzle in the firm grip.\n\n“Bel,” said the Harvester, “I am all at sea. One day I think maybe I\nhave a little chance, the next----none at all. I had an hour of solid\ncomfort to-day, now I'm in the sweat box again. It's a little selfish\nstreak in me, Bel, that hates to see Harmon go into the hospital and\ntake my place with the Careys. They are my best and only friends. He is\nyoung, social, handsome, and will be ever present. In three months he\nwill become so popular that I might as well be off the earth. I wish I\ndidn't think it, but I'm so small that I do. And then there is my\nDream Girl, Bel. The girl you found for me, old fellow. There never was\nanother like her, and she has my heart for all time. And he has hers.\nThat hospital plan is the best thing in the world for her. It will keep\nher where Carey can have an eye on her, where the air is better, where\nshe can have company without the city crush, where she is close the\ncountry, and a good living is assured. Bel, it's the nicest arrangement\nyou ever saw for every one we know, except us.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed shortly. “Bel,” he said, “tell me! If a man lived\na hundred years, could he have the heartache all the way? Seems like\nI've had it almost that long now. In fact, I've had it such ages I'd\nbe lonesome without it. This is some more of my very own medicine, so I\nshouldn't make a wry face over taking it. I knew what would happen when\nI sent for him, and I didn't hesitate. I must not now.\n\n“Only I got to stop one thing, Bel. I told him I would play square,\nand I have. But here it ends. After this, I must step back and be big\nbrother. Lots of fun in this brother business, Bel. But maybe I am cut\nout for it. Anyway it's written! But if it is, how did she come to allow\nme such privileges as I took to-day? That wasn't professional by any\nmeans. It was just the stiffest love-making I knew how to do, Bel, and\nshe didn't object by the quiver of an eyelash. God knows I was watching\nclosely enough for any sign that I was distasteful. And I might have\nbeen well enough. Rough, herb-stained old clothes, unshaven, everything\nto offend a dainty girl. She said I might hold her again to-morrow. And,\nBel, what the nation did she hug me like that for, if she's going to\nmarry him? Boy, I see my way clear to an hour more. While I'm at it,\njust to surprise myself, I believe I'll take it like other men. I think\nI'll go on a little bender, and make what probably will be the last day\na plumb good one. Something worth remembering is better than nothing\nat all, Bel! He hasn't told me that he has won. She didn't SAY she was\ngoing to marry him, and she did say he hurt her, and she wanted me. Bel,\nhow about the grimness of it, if she should marry him and then discover\nthat he hurts her, and she wants me. Lord God Almighty, if you have any\nmercy at all, never put me up against that,” prayed the Harvester, “for\nmy heart is water where she is concerned.”\n\nThe Harvester arose, and going to the lake, he cut an arm load of big,\npink mallows, covered each mound with fresh flowers, whistled to the\ndog, and went to his work. Many things had accumulated, and he cleaned\nthe barn, carried herbs from the dry-house to the store-room, and put\neverything into shape. Close noon the next day he went to Onabasha, and\nwas gone three hours. He came back barbered in the latest style, and\ncarrying a big bundle. When the hour for arranging the bed came, he was\nyet in his room, but he sent word he would be there in a second.\n\nAs he crossed the living-room he pulled a chair to the veranda and\nplaced a footstool before it. Then he stepped into the sunshine room. A\nquizzical expression crossed the face of Doctor Harmon as he closed the\nbook he was reading aloud to the Girl and arose. Wholly unembarrassed\nthe Harvester smiled.\n\n“Have I got this rigging anywhere near right?” he inquired.\n\n“David, what have you done?” gasped the amazed Girl.\n\n“I didn't feel anywhere near up to the 'mark of my high calling'\nyesterday,” quoted the Harvester. “I don't know how I appear, but I'm\nclean as shaving, soap and hot water will make me, and my clothing will\nnot smell offensively. Now come out of that bed for a happy hour. Where\nis that big coverlet? You are going on the veranda to-day.”\n\n“You look just like every one else,” complained Doctor Harmon.\n\n“You look perfectly lovely,” declared the Girl.\n\n“The swale sends you this invitation to come and see star-shine at the\nfoot of mullein hill,” said the Harvester, offering a bouquet. It was a\nloose bunch of long-stemmed, delicate flowers, each an inch across, and\nhaving five pearl-white petals lightly striped with pale green. Five\nlong gold anthers arose, and at their base gold stamens and a green\npistil. The leaves were heart-shaped and frosty, whitish-green,\nresembling felt. The Harvester bent to offer them.\n\n“Have some Grass of Parnassus, my dear,” he said.\n\nThe Girl waved them away. “Go stand over there by the door and slowly\nturn around. I want to see you.”\n\nThe Harvester obeyed. He was freshly and carefully shaven. His hair\nwas closely cropped at the base of the head, long, heavy, and slightly\nwaving on top. He wore a white silk shirt, with a rolling collar and\ntie, white trousers, belt, hose, and shoes, and his hands were manicured\nwith care.\n\n“Have I made a mess of it, or do I appear anything like other men?” he\nasked, eagerly.\n\nThe Girl lifted her eyes to Doctor Harmon and smiled.\n\n“Do you observe anything messy?” she inquired.\n\n“You needn't fish for compliments quite so obviously,” he answered.\n“I'll pay them without being asked. I do not. He is quite correct, and\ninfinitely better looking than the average. Distinguished is a proper\nword for the gentleman in my opinion. But why, in Heaven's name, have we\nnever had the pleasure of seeing you thus before?”\n\n“Look here, Doc,” said the Harvester, “do you mean that you enjoy\nlooking at me merely because I am dressed this way?”\n\n“I do indeed,” said the doctor. “It is good to see you with the garb of\nwork laid aside, and the stamp of cleanliness and ease upon you.”\n\n“By gum, that is rubbing it in a little too rough!” cried the Harvester.\n“I bathe oftener than you do. My clothing is always clean when I start\nout. Of course, in my work I come hourly in contact with muck, water,\nand herb juices.”\n\n“It's understood that is unavoidable,” said Doctor Harmon.\n\n“And if cleanliness is made an issue, I'd rather roll in any of it\nthan put my finger tips into the daily work of a surgeon,” added the\nHarvester, and the Girl giggled.\n\n“That's enough Medicine Man!” she said. “You did not make a 'mess' of\nit, or anything else you ever attempted. As for appearing like other\nmen, thank Heaven, you do not. You look just a whole world bigger and\nbetter and finer. Come, carry me out quickly. I am wild to go. Please\nput my lovely flowers in water, Molly, only give me a few to hold.”\n\nThe Harvester arranged the pink coverlet, picked up the Girl, and\ncarried her to the living-room.\n\n“We will rest here a little,” he said, “and then, if you feel equal to\nit, we will try the veranda. Are you easy now?”\n\nShe nestled her face against the soft shirt and smiled at him. She\nlifted her hand, laid it on his smooth cheek and then the crisp hair.\n\n“Oh Man!” she cried. “Thank God you didn't give me up, too! I want life!\nI want LIFE!”\n\nThe Harvester tightened his grip just a trifle. “Then I thank God, too,”\n he said. “Can you tell me how you are, dear? Is there any difference?”\n\n“Yes,” she answered. “I grow tired lying so long, but there isn't the\nghost of an ache in my bones. I can just feel pure, delicious blood\nrunning in my veins. My hands and feet are always warm, and my head\ncool.”\n\nThe Harvester's face drew very close. “How about your heart, honey?” he\nwhispered. “Anything new there?”\n\n“Yes, I am all over new inside and out. I want to shout, run, sing, and\nswim. Oh I'd give anything to have you carry me down and dip me in the\nlake right now.”\n\n“Soon, Girl! That will come soon,” prophesied the Harvester.\n\n“I scarcely can wait. And you did say a saddle, didn't you? Won't it be\ngreat to come galloping up the levee, when the leaves are red and the\nfrost is in the air. Oh am I going fast enough?”\n\n“Much faster than I expected,” said the Harvester. “You are surprising\nall of us, me most of any. Ruth, you almost make me hope that you regard\nthis as home. Honey, you are thinking a little of me these days?”\n\nThe hand that had fallen from his hair lay on his shoulder. Now it slid\naround his neck, and gripped him with all its strength.\n\n“Heaps and heaps!” she said. “All I get a chance to, for being bothered\nand fussed over, and everlastingly read mushy stuff that's intended for\nsome one else. Please take me to the veranda now; I want to tell you\nsomething.”\n\nHis head swam, but the Harvester set his feet firmly, arose, and carried\nhis Dream Girl back to outdoor life. When he reached the chair, she\nbegged him to go a few steps farther to the bench on the lake shore.\n\n“I am afraid,” said the man.\n\n“It's so warm. There can't be any difference in the air. Just a minute.”\n\nThe Harvester pushed open the screen, went to the bench, and seating\nhimself, drew the cover closely around her.\n\n“Don't speak a word for a long time,” he said. “Just rest. If I tire you\ntoo much and spoil everything, I will be desperate.”\n\nHe clasped her to him, laid his cheek against her hair, and his lips on\nher forehead. He held her hand and kissed it over and over, and again\nhe watched and could find no resentment. The cool, pungent breeze swept\nfrom the lake, and the voices of wild life chattered at their feet.\nSometimes the water folks splashed, while a big black and gold butterfly\nmistook the Girl's dark hair for a perching place and settled on it,\nslowly opening its wonderful wings.\n\n“Lie quietly, Girl,” whispered the Harvester. “You are wearing a living\njewel, an ornament above price, on your hair. Maybe you can see it when\nit goes. There!”\n\n“Oh I did!” she cried. “How I love it here! Before long may I lie in the\ndining-room window a while so I can see the water. I like the hill, but\nI love the lake more.”\n\n“Now if you just would love me,” said the Harvester, “you would have all\nMedicine Woods in your heart.”\n\n“Don't hurry me so!” said the Girl. “You gave me a year; and it's only a\nfew weeks, and I've not been myself, and I'm not now. I mustn't make any\nmistake, and all I know for sure is that I want you most, and I can rest\nbest with you, and I miss you every minute you are gone. I think that\nshould satisfy you.”\n\n“That would be enough for any reasonable man,” said the Harvester\nangrily. “Forgive me, Ruth, I have been cruel. I forgot how frail and\nweak you are. It is having Harmon here that makes me unnatural. It\nalmost drives me to frenzy to know that he may take you from me.”\n\n“Then send him away!”\n\n“SEND HIM AWAY?”\n\n“Yes, send him away! I am tired to death of his poetry, and seeing him\nspoon around. Send both of them away quickly!”\n\nThe Harvester gulped, blinked, and surreptitiously felt for her pulse.\n\n“Oh, I've not developed fever again,” she said. “I'm all right. But it\nmust be a fearful expense to have both of them here by the week, and I'm\nso tired of them, Granny says she can take care of me just as well,\nand the girl who helps her can cook. No one but you shall lift me, if I\ndon't get my nose Out until I can walk alone Both of them are perfectly\nuseless, and I'd much rather you'd send them away.”\n\n“There, there! Of course!” said the Harvester soothingly. “I'll do it\nas soon as I possibly dare. You don't understand, honey. You are yet\ndelicate beyond measure, internally. The fever burned so long. Every\nmorsel you eat is measured and cooked in sterilized vessels, and I'd be\nscared of my life to have the girl undertake it.”\n\n“Why she is doing it straight along now! She and Granny! Molly isn't out\nof Doctor Harmon's sight long enough to cook anything. Granny says there\nis 'a lot of buncombe about what they do, and she is going to tell them\nso right to their teeth some of these days, if they badger her much\nmore,' and I wish she would, and you, too.”\n\nThe Harvester gathered the Girl to him in one crushing bear hug.\n\n“For the love of Heaven, Ruth, you drive me crazy! Answer me just one\nquestion. When you told me that you 'adored and worshipped' Doctor\nHarmon, did you mean it, or was that the delirium of fever?”\n\n“I don't know WHAT I told you! If I said I 'adored' him, it was the\ntruth. I did! I do! I always will! So do I adore the Almighty, but\nthat's no sign I want him to read poetry to me, and be around all the\ntime when I am wild for a minute with you. I can worship Doctor Harmon\nin Chicago or Onabasha quite as well. Fire him! If you don't, I will!”\n\n“Good Lord!” cried the Harvester, helpless until the Girl had to cling\nto him to prevent rolling from his nerveless arms. “Ruth, Ruth, will you\nfeel my pulse?”\n\n“No, I won't! But you are going to drop me. Take me straight back to my\nbeautiful new bed, and send them away.”\n\n“A minute! Give me a minute!” gasped the Harvester. “I couldn't lift a\nbaby just now. Ruth, dear, I thought you LOVED the man.”\n\n“What made you think so?”\n\n“You did!”\n\n“I didn't either! I never said I loved him. I said I was under\nobligations to him; but they are as well repaid as they ever can be. I\nsaid I adored him, and I tell you I do! Give him what we owe him, both\nof us, in money, and send them away. If you'd seen as much of them as I\nhave, you'd be tired of them, too. Please, please, David!”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester, arising in a sudden tide of effulgent joy.\n“Yes, Girl, just as quickly as I can with decency. I----I'll send them\non the lake, and I'll take care of you.”\n\n“You won't read poetry to me?”\n\n“I will not.”\n\n“You won't moon at me?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Then hurry! But have them take your boat. I am going to have the first\nride in mine.”\n\n“Indeed you are, and soon, too!” said the Harvester, marching up the\nhill as if he were leading hosts to battle.\n\nHe laid the Girl on the bed and covered her, and called Granny Moreland\nto sit beside her a few minutes. He went into the gold garden and\nproposed that the doctor and the nurse go rowing until supper time, and\nthey went with alacrity. When they started he returned to the Girl and,\nsitting beside her, he told Granny to take a nap. Then he began to talk\nsoftly all about wild music, and how it was made, and what the different\nodours sweeping down the hill were, and when the red leaves would come,\nand the nuts rattle down, and the frost fairies enamel the windows, and\nsoon she was sound asleep. Granny came back, and the Harvester walked\naround the lake shore to be alone a while and think quietly, for he was\nalmost too dazed and bewildered for full realization.\n\nAs he softly followed the foot path he heard voices, and looking down,\nhe saw the boat lying in the shade and beneath a big tree on the bank\nsat the doctor and the nurse. His arm was around her, and her head was\non his shoulder; and she said very distinctly, “How long will it be\nuntil we can go without offending him?”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. A VERTICAL SPINE\n\nBy middle September the last trace of illness had been removed from the\npremises, and it was rapidly disappearing from the face and form of the\nGirl. She was showing a beautiful roundness, there was lovely colour on\nher cheeks and lips, and in her dark eyes sparkled a touch of mischief.\nRigidly she followed the rules laid down for diet and exercise, and as\nstrength flowed through her body, and no trace of pain tormented her,\nshe began revelling in new and delightful sensations. She loved to pull\nher boat as she willed, drive over the wood road, study the books,\ncook the new dishes, rearrange furniture, and go with the Harvester\neverywhere.\n\nBut that was greatly the management of the man. He was so afraid that\nsomething might happen to undo all the wonders accomplished in the Girl,\nand again whiten her face with pain, that he scarcely allowed her out of\nhis sight. He remained in the cabin, helping when she worked, and then\ndrove with her and a big blanket to the woods, arranged her chair and\ntable, found some attractive subject, and while the wind ravelled her\nhair and flushed her cheeks, her fingers drew designs. At noon they\nwent to the cabin to lunch, and the Girl took a nap, while the Harvester\nspread his morning's reaping on the shelves to dry. They returned to\nthe woods until five o'clock; then home again and the Girl dressed\nand prepared supper, while the Harvester spread his stores and fed the\nstock. Then he put on white clothing for the evening. The Girl rested\nwhile he washed the dishes, and they explored the lake in the little\nmotor boat, or drove to the city for supplies, or to see their friends.\n\n“Are you even with your usual work at this time of the year?” she asked\nas they sat at breakfast.\n\n“I am,” said the Harvester. “The only things that have been crowded out\nare the candlesticks. They will have to remain on the shelf until the\nherbs and roots are all in, and the long winter evenings come. Then I'll\nuse the luna pattern and finish yours first of all.”\n\n“What are you going to do to-day?”\n\n“Start on a regular fall campaign. Some of it for the sake of having it,\nand some because there is good money in it. Will you come?”\n\n“Indeed yes. May I help, or shall I take my drawing along?”\n\n“Bring your drawing. Next fall you may help, but as yet you are too\nclose suffering for me to see you do anything that might be even a\nslight risk. I can't endure it.”\n\n“Baby!” she jeered.\n\n“Christen me anything you please,” laughed the Harvester. “I'm short on\nnames anyway.”\n\nHe went to harness Betsy, and the Girl washed the dishes, straightened\nthe rooms, and collected her drawing material. Then she walked up the\nhill, wearing a shirt and short skirt of khaki, stout shoes, and a straw\nhat that shaded her face. She climbed into the wagon, laid the drawing\nbox on the seat, and caught the lines as the Harvester flung them to\nher. He went swinging ahead, Belshazzar to heel, the Girl driving\nafter. The white pigeons circled above, and every day Ajax allowed his\ncuriosity to overcome his temper, and followed a little farther.\n\n“Whoa, Betsy!” The Girl tugged at the lines; but Betsy took the bit\nbetween her teeth, and plodded after the Harvester. She pulled with\nall her might, but her strength was not nearly sufficient to stop the\nstubborn animal.\n\n“Whoa, David!” cried the Girl.\n\n“What is it?” the Harvester turned.\n\n“Won't you please wait until I can take off my hat? I love to ride\nbareheaded through the woods, and Betsy won't stop until you do, no\nmatter how hard I pull.”\n\n“Betsy, you're no lady!” said the Harvester. “Why don't you stop when\nyou're told?”\n\n“I shan't waste any more strength on her,” said the Girl. “Hereafter I\nshall say, 'Gee, David,' 'Haw, David,' 'Whoa, David,' and then she will\ndo exactly as you.”\n\nThe Harvester stopped half way up the hill, and beside a large, shaded\nbed spread the rug, and set up the little table and chair for the Girl.\n\n“Want a plant to draw?” he asked. “This is very important to us. It\nhas a string of names as long as a princess, but I call it goldenseal,\nbecause the roots are yellow. The chemists ask for hydrastis. That\nsounds formidable, but it's a cousin of buttercups. The woods of Ohio\nand Indiana produce the finest that ever grew, but it is so nearly\nextinct now that the trade can be supplied by cultivation only. I\nsuspect I'm responsible for its disappearance around here. I used to get\na dollar fifty a pound, and most of my clothes and books when a boy I\nowe to it. Now I get two for my finest grade; that accounts for the size\nof these beds.”\n\n“It's pretty!” said the Girl, studying a plant averaging a foot in\nheight. On a slender, round, purplish stem arose one big, rough leaf,\nheavily veined, and having from five to nine lobes. Opposite was a\nsimilar leaf, but very small, and a head of scarlet berries resembling\na big raspberry in shape. The Harvester shook the black woods soil from\nthe yellow roots, and held up the plant.\n\n“You won't enjoy the odour,” he said.\n\n“Well I like the leaves. I know I can use them some way. They are so\nunusual. What wonderful colour in the roots!”\n\n“One of its names is Indian paint,” explained the Harvester. “Probably\nit furnished the squaws of these woods with colouring matter. Now let's\nsee what we can get out of it. You draw the plant and I'll dig the\nroots.”\n\nFor a time the Girl bent over her work and the Harvester was busy.\nBelshazzar ranged the woods chasing chipmunks. The birds came asking\nquestions. When the drawing was completed, other subjects were found at\nevery turn, and the Girl talked almost constantly, her face alive with\ninterest. The May-apple beds lay close, and she drew from them. She\nlearned the uses and prices of the plant, and also made drawings of\ncohosh, moonseed and bloodroot. That was so wonderful in its root\ncolour, the Harvester filled the little cup with water and she began\nto paint. Intensely absorbed she bent above the big, notched, silvery\nleaves and the blood-red roots, testing and trying to match them\nexactly. Every few minutes the Harvester leaned over her shoulder to see\nhow she was progressing and to offer suggestions. When she finished she\npicked up a trailing vine of moonseed.\n\n“You have this on the porch,” she said. “I think it is lovely. There\nis no end to the beautiful combinations of leaves, and these are such\npretty little grape-like clusters; but if you touch them the slightest\nyou soil the wonderful surface.”\n\n“And that makes the fairies very sad,” said the Harvester. “They love\nthat vine best of any, because they paint its fruit with the most care.\n'Bloom' the scientists call it. You see it on cultivated plums, grapes,\nand apples, but never in any such perfection as on moonseed and black\nhaws in the woods. You should be able to design a number of pretty\nthings from the cohosh leaves and berries, too. You scarcely can get a\nstart this fall, but early in the spring you can begin, and follow the\nseason. If your work comes out well this winter, I'll send some of it to\nthe big publishing houses, and you can make book and magazine covers and\ndecorations, if you would like.”\n\n“'If I would like!' How modest! You know perfectly well that if I could\nmake a design that would be accepted, and used on a book or magazine, I\nwould almost fly. Oh do you suppose I could?”\n\n“I don't 'suppose' anything about it, I know,” said the Harvester. “It\nis not possible that the public can be any more tired of wild roses,\ngolden-rod, and swallows than the poor art editors who accept them\nbecause they can't help themselves. Dangle something fresh and new under\ntheir noses and see them snap. The next time I go to Onabasha I'll get\nyou some popular magazines, and you can compare what is being used with\nwhat you see here, and judge for yourself how glad they would be for a\nchange. And potteries, arts and crafts shops, and wall paper factories,\nthey'd be crazy for the designs I could furnish them. As for money,\nthere's more in it than the herbs, if I only could draw.”\n\n“I can do that,” said the Girl. “Trail the vine and give me an idea\nhow to scale it. I'll just make studies now, and this winter I'll\nconventionalize them and work them into patterns. Won't that be fun?”\n\n“That's more than fun, Ruth,” said the Harvester solemnly. “That is\ncreation. That touches the provinces of the Almighty. That is taking His\nunknown wonders and making them into pleasure and benefit for thousands,\nnot to mention filling your face with awe divine, and lighting your eyes\nwith interest and ambition. That is life, Ruth. You are beginning to\nlive right now.”\n\n“I see,” said the Girl. “I understand! I am!”\n\n“You get your subjects now. When the harvest is over I'll show you what\nI have in my head, and before Christmas the fun will begin.”\n\n“What next?”\n\n“Sketch a sarsaparilla plant and this yam vine. It grows on your veranda\ntoo----the rattle box, you remember. The leaves and seeding arrangements\nare wonderful. You can do any number of things with them, and all will\nbe new.”\n\nHe called her attention to and brought her samples of ginger leaves,\nIndian hemp, queen-of-the-meadow, cone-flower, burdock, baneberry, and\nIndian turnip, as he harvested them in turn. When they came to the large\nbeds of orange pleurisy root the Girl cried out with pleasure.\n\n“We will take its prosaic features first,” said the Harvester. “It is\ngood medicine and worth handling. Forget that! The Bird Woman calls it\nbutterfly flower. That's better. Now try to analyze a single bloom of\nthis gaudy mass, and you will see why there's poetry coming.”\n\nHe knelt beside the Girl, separating the blooms and pointing out their\nmarvellous colour and construction. She leaned against his shoulder, and\nwatched with breathless interest. As his bare head brought its mop of\ndamp wind-rumpled hair close, she ran her fingers through it, and with\nher handkerchief wiped his forehead.\n\n“Sometimes I almost wish you'd get sick,” she said irrelevantly.\n\n“In the name of common sense, why?” demanded the Harvester.\n\n“Oh it must be born in the heart of a woman to want to mother\nsomething,” answered the Girl. “I feel sometimes as if I would like to\ntake care of you, as if you were a little fellow. David, I know why\nyour mother fought to make you the man she desired. You must have been\ncharming when small. I can shut my eyes and just see the boy you were,\nand I should have loved you as she did.”\n\n“How about the man I am?” inquired the Harvester promptly. “Any leanings\ntoward him yet, Ruth?”\n\n“It's getting worser and worser every day and hour,” said the Girl. “I\ndon't understand it at all. I wouldn't try to live without you. I don't\nwant you to leave my sight. Everything you do is the way I would have\nit. Nothing you ever say shocks or offends me. I'd love to render you\nany personal service. I want to take you in my arms and hug you tight\nhalf a dozen times a day as a reward for the kind and lovely things you\ndo for me.”\n\nA dull red flamed up the neck and over the face of the Harvester. One\narm lifted to the chair back, the other dropped across the table so that\nthe Girl was almost encircled.\n\n“For the love of mercy, Ruth, why haven't I had a hint of this before?”\n he cried.\n\n“You said you'd hate me. You said you'd drop me into the deepest part of\nthe lake if I deceived you; and if I have to tell the truth, why, that\nis all of it. I think it is nonsense about some wonderful feeling that\nis going to take possession of your heart when you love any one. I love\nyou so much I'd gladly suffer to save you pain or sorrow. But there are\nno thrills; it's just steady, sober, common sense that I should love\nyou, and I do. Why can't you be satisfied with what I can give, David?”\n\n“Because it's husks and ashes,” said the Harvester grimly. “You drive me\nto desperation, Ruth. I am almost wild for your love, but what you offer\nme is plain, straight affection, nothing more. There isn't a trace of\nthe feeling that should exist between man and wife in it. Some men might\nbe satisfied to be your husband, and be regarded as a father or brother.\nI am not. The red bird didn't want a sister, Ruth, he was asking for a\nmate. So am I. That's as plain as I know how to put it. There is some\nway to awaken you into a living, loving woman, and, please God, I'll\nfind it yet, but I'm slow about it; there's no question of that. Never\nyou mind! Don't worry! Some of these days I have faith to believe it\nwill sweep you as a tide sweeps the shore, and then I hope God will be\ngood enough to let me be where you will land in my arms.”\n\nThe Girl sat looking at him between narrowed lids. Suddenly she took his\nhead between her hands, drew his face to hers and deliberately kissed\nhim. Then she drew away and searched his eyes.\n\n“There!” she challenged. “What is the matter with that?”\n\nThe Harvester's colour slowly faded to a sickly white.\n\n“Ruth, you try me almost beyond human endurance,” he said. “'What's the\nmatter with that?'” He arose, stepped back, folded his arms, and stared\nat her. “'What's the matter with that?'” he repeated. “Never was I so\nsorely tempted in all my life as I am now to lie to you, and say there\nis nothing, and take you in my arms and try to awaken you to what I\nmean by love. But suppose I do----and fail! Then comes the agony of slow\nendurance for me, and the possibility that any day you may meet the man\nwho can arouse in you the feelings I cannot. That would mean my oath\nbroken, and my heart as well; while soon you would dislike me beyond\ntolerance, even. I dare not risk it! The matter is, that was the loving\ncaress of a ten-year-old girl to a big brother she admired. That's all!\nNot much, but a mighty big defect when it is offered a strong man as\nfuel on which to feed consuming passion.”\n\n“Consuming passion,” repeated the Girl. “David you never lie, and you\nnever exaggerate. Do you honestly mean that there is something----oh,\nthere is! I can see it! You are really suffering, and if I come to you,\nand try my best to comfort you, you'll only call it baby affection that\nyou don't want. David, what am I going to do?”\n\n“You are going to the cabin,” said the Harvester, “and cook us a big\nsupper. I am dreadfully hungry. I'll be along presently. Don't worry,\nRuth, you are all right! That kiss was lovely. Tell me that you are not\nangry with me.”\n\nHer eyes were wet as she smiled at him.\n\n“If there is a bigger brute than a man anywhere on the footstool, I\nshould like to meet it,” said the Harvester, “and see what it appears\nlike. Go along, honey; I'll be there as soon as I load.”\n\nHe drove to the dry-house, washed and spread his reaping on the big\ntrays, fed the stock, dressed in the white clothing and entered the\nkitchen. That the Girl had been crying was obvious, but he overlooked\nit, helped with the work, and then they took a boat ride. When they\nreturned he proposed that she should select her favourite likeness of\nher mother, and the next time he went to the city he would take it\nwith his, and order the enlargements he had planned. To save carrying\na lighted lamp into the closet he brought her little trunk to the\nliving-room, where she opened it and hunted the pictures. There were\nseveral, and all of them were of a young, elegantly dressed woman of\ngreat beauty. The Harvester studied them long.\n\n“Who was she, Ruth?” he asked at last.\n\n“I don't know, and I have no desire to learn.”\n\n“Can you explain how the girl here represented came to marry a brother\nof Henry Jameson?”\n\n“Yes. I was past twelve when my father came the last time, and I\nremember him distinctly. If Uncle Henry were properly clothed, he is\nnot a bad man in appearance, unless he is very angry. He can use proper\nlanguage, if he chooses. My father was the best in him, refined and\nintensified. He was much taller, very good looking, and he dressed and\nspoke well. They were born and grew to manhood in the East, and came out\nhere at the same time. Where Uncle Henry is a trickster and a trader\nin stock, my father went a step higher, and tricked and traded in\nmen----and women! Mother told me this much once. He saw her somewhere\nand admired her. He learned who she was, went to her father's law office\nand pretended he was representing some great business in the West, until\nhe was welcomed as a promising client. He hung around and when she came\nin one day her father was forced to introduce them. The remainder is the\nsame world-old story----a good looking, glib-tongued man, plying every\nart known to an expert, on an innocent girl.”\n\n“Is he dead, Ruth?”\n\n“We thought so. We hoped so.”\n\n“Your mother did not feel that her people might be suffering for her as\nshe was for them?”\n\n“Not after she appealed to them twice and received no reply.”\n\n“Perhaps they tried to find her. Maybe she has a father or mother who\nis longing for word from her now. Are you very sure you are right in not\nwanting to know?”\n\n“She never gave me a hint from which I could tell who or where they\nwere. In so gentle a woman as my mother that only could mean she did not\nwant them to know of her. Neither do I. This is the photograph I prefer;\nplease use it.”\n\n“I'll put back the trunk in the morning, when I can see better,” said\nthe Harvester.\n\nThe Girl closed it, and soon went to bed. But there was no sleep for\nthe man. He went into the night, and for hours he paced the driveway in\nracking thought. Then he sat on the step and looked at Belshazzar before\nhim.\n\n“Life's growing easier every minute, Bel,” said the Harvester. “Here's\nmy Dream Girl, lovely as the most golden instant of that wonderful\ndream, offering me----offering me, Bel----in my present pass, the lips\nand the love of my little sister who never was born. And I've hurt\nRuth's feelings, and sent her to bed with a heartache, trying to make\nher see that it won't do. It won't, Bel! If I can't have genuine love, I\ndon't want anything. I told her so as plainly as I could find words, and\nset her crying, and made her unhappy to end a wonderful day. But in\nsome way she has got to learn that propinquity, tolerance, approval,\naffection, even----is not love. I can't take the risk, after all these\nyears of waiting for the real thing. If I did, and love never came, I\nwould end----well, I know how I would end----and that would spoil her\nlife. I simply have got to brace up, Bel, and keep on trying. She thinks\nit is nonsense about thrills, and some wonderful feeling that takes\npossession of you. Lord, Bel! There isn't much nonsense about the thing\nthat rages in my brain, heart, soul, and body. It strikes me as the\ngravest reality that ever overtook a man.\n\n“She is growing wonderfully attached to me. 'Couldn't live without me,'\nBel, that is what she said. Maybe it would be a scheme to bring Granny\nhere to stay with her, and take a few months in some city this winter\non those chemical points that trouble me. There is an old saying about\n'absence making the heart grow fonder.' Maybe separation is the thing to\nwork the trick. I've tried about everything else I know.\n\n“But I'm in too much of a hurry! What a fool a man is! A few weeks ago,\nBel, I said to myself that if Harmon were away and had no part in her\nlife I'd be the happiest man alive. Happiest man alive! Bel, take a look\nat me now! Happy! Well, why shouldn't I be happy? She is here. She is\ngrowing in strength and beauty every hour. She cares more for me day\nby day. From an outside viewpoint it seems as if I had almost all a man\ncould ask in reason. But when was a strong man in the grip of love ever\nreasonable? I think the Almighty took a pretty grave responsibility when\nHe made men as He did. If I had been He, and understood the forces I was\nhandling, I would have been too big a coward to do it. There is nothing\nfor me, Bel, but to move on doing my level best; and if she doesn't\nawaken soon, I will try the absent treatment. As sure as you are the\nmost faithful dog a man ever owned, Bel, I'll try the absent treatment.”\n\nThe Harvester arose and entered the cabin, stepping softly, for it was\ndark in the Girl's room, and he could not hear a sound there. He turned\nup the lights in the living-room. As he did so the first thing he saw\nwas the little trunk. He looked at it intently, then picked up a book.\nEvery page he turned he glanced again at the trunk. At last he laid\ndown the book and sat staring, his brain working rapidly. He ended by\ncarrying the trunk to his room. He darkened the living-room, lighted his\nown, drew the rain screens, and piece by piece carefully examined the\ncontents. There were the pictures, but the name of the photographer had\nbeen removed. There was not a word that would help in identification. He\nemptied it to the bottom, and as he picked up the last piece his fingers\nstruck in a peculiar way that did not give the impression of touching\na solid surface. He felt over it carefully, and when he examined with\na candle he plainly could see where the cloth lining had been cut and\nlifted.\n\nFor a long time he knelt staring at it, then he deliberately inserted\nhis knife blade and raised it. The cloth had been glued to a heavy sheet\nof pasteboard the exact size of the trunk bottom. Beneath it lay half a\ndozen yellow letters, and face down two tissue-wrapped photographs. The\nHarvester examined them first. They were of a man close forty, having\na strong, aggressive face, on which pride and dominant will power were\nprominently indicated. The other was a reproduction of a dainty and\ndelicate woman, with exquisitely tender and gentle features. Long the\nHarvester studied them. The names of the photographer and the city were\nmissing. There was nothing except the faces. He could detect traces\nof the man in the poise of the Girl and the carriage of her head, and\nsuggestions of the woman in the refined sweetness of her expression.\nEach picture represented wealth in dress and taste in pose. Finally he\nlaid them together on the table, picked up one of the letters, and read\nit. Then he read all of them.\n\nBefore he finished, tears were running down his cheeks, and his\nresolution was formed. These were the appeals of an adoring mother,\ncrazed with fear for the safety of an only child, who unfortunately\nhad fallen under the influence of a man the mother dreaded and feared,\nbecause of her knowledge of life and men of his character. They were one\nlong, impassioned plea for the daughter not to trust a stranger, not\nto believe that vows of passion could be true when all else in life was\nfalse, not to trust her untried judgment of men and the world against\nthe experience of her parents. But whether the tears that stained those\nsheets had fallen from the eyes of the suffering mother or the starved\nand deserted daughter, there was no way for the Harvester to know. One\nthing was clear: It was not possible for him to rest until he knew if\nthat woman yet lived and bore such suffering. But every trace of address\nhad been torn away, and there was nothing to indicate where or in what\ncircumstances these letters had been written.\n\nA long time the Harvester sat in deep thought. Then he returned all the\nletters save one. This with the pictures he made into a packet that he\nlocked in his desk. The trunk he replaced and then went to bed. Early\nthe next morning he drove to Onabasha and posted the parcel. The address\nit bore was that of the largest detective agency in the country. Then\nhe bought an interesting book, a box of fruit, and hurried back to the\nGirl. He found her on the veranda, Belshazzar stretched close with one\neye shut and the other on his charge, whose cheeks were flushed with\nlovely colour as she bent over her drawing material. The Harvester went\nto her with a rush, and slipping his fingers under her chin, tilted back\nher head against him.\n\n“Got a kiss for me, honey?” he inquired.\n\n“No sir,” answered the Girl emphatically. “I gave you a perfectly lovely\none yesterday, and you said it was not right. I am going to try just\nonce more, and if you say again that it won't do, I'm going back to\nChicago or to my dear Uncle Henry, I haven't decided which.”\n\nHer lips were smiling, but her eyes were full of tears.\n\n“Why thank you, Ruth! I think that is wonderful,” said the Harvester.\n“I'll risk the next one. In the meantime, excuse me if I give you a\ndemonstration of the real thing, just to furnish you an idea of how it\nshould be.”\n\nThe Harvester delivered the sample, and went striding to the marsh. The\ndazed Girl sat staring at her work, trying to realize what had happened;\nfor that was the first time the Harvester had kissed her on the lips,\nand it was the material expression a strong man gives the woman he loves\nwhen his heart is surging at high tide. The Girl sat motionless, gazing\nat her study.\n\nIn the marsh she knew the Harvester was reaping queen-of-the-meadow,\nand around the high borders, elecampane and burdock. She could hear his\nvoice in snatches of song or cheery whistle; notes that she divined\nwere intended to keep her from worrying. Intermingled with them came the\ndog's bark of defiance as he digged for an escaping chipmunk, his note\nof pleading when he wanted a root cut with the mattock, his cry of\ndiscovery when he thought he had found something the Harvester would\nlike, or his yelp of warning when he scented danger. The Girl looked\ndown the drive to the lake and across at the hedge. Everywhere she saw\nglowing colour, with intermittent blue sky and green leaves, all of it a\ncomplete picture, from which nothing could be spared. She turned slowly\nand looked toward the marsh, trying to hear the words of the song above\nthe ripple of Singing Water, and to see the form of the man. Slowly\nshe lifted her handkerchief and pressed it against her lips, as she\nwhispered in an awed voice,\n\n“My gracious Heaven, is THAT the kind of a kiss he is expecting me to\ngive HIM? Why, I couldn't----not to save my life.”\n\nShe placed her brushes in water, set the colour box on the paper, and\nwent to the kitchen to prepare the noon lunch. As she worked the soft\ncolour deepened in her cheeks, a new light glowed in her eyes, and she\nhummed over the tune that floated across the marsh. She was very busy\nwhen the Harvester came, but he spoke casually of his morning's work,\nate heartily, and ordered her to take a nap while he washed roots and\nfilled the trays, and then they went to the woods together for the\nafternoon.\n\nIn the evening they came home to the cabin and finished the day's\nwork. As the night was chilly, the Harvester heaped some bark in the\nliving-room fireplace, and lay on the rug before it, while the Girl sat\nin an easy chair and watched him as he talked. He was telling her about\nsome wonderful combinations he was going to compound for different\nailments and he laughingly asked her if she wanted to be a millionaire's\nwife and live in a palace.\n\n“Of course I could if I wanted to!” she suggested.\n\n“You could!” cried the Harvester. “All that is necessary is to combine\na few proper drugs in one great remedy and float it. That is easy! The\npeople will do the remainder.”\n\n“You talk as if you believe that,” marvelled the Girl.\n\n“Want it proven?” challenged the Harvester.\n\n“No!” she cried in swift alarm. “What do we want with more than we have?\nWhat is there necessary to happiness that is not ours now? Maybe it is\ntrue that the 'love of money is the root of all evil.' Don't you ever\nget a lot just to find out. You said the night I came here that you\ndidn't want more than you had and now I don't. I won't have it! It\nmight bring restlessness and discontent. I've seen it make other people\nunhappy and separate them. I don't want money, I want work. You make\nyour remedies and offer them to suffering humanity for just a living\nprofit, and I'll keep house and draw designs. I am perfectly happy,\nfree, and unspeakably content. I never dreamed that it was possible for\nme to be so glad, and so filled with the joy of life. There is only one\nthing on earth I want. If I only could----”\n\n“Could what, Ruth?”\n\n“Could get that kiss right----”\n\nThe Harvester laughed.\n\n“Forget it, I tell you!” he commanded. “Just so long as you worry and\nfret, so long I've got to wait. If you quit thinking about it, all\n'unbeknownst' to yourself you'll awake some morning with it on your\nlips. I can see traces of it growing stronger every day. Very soon now\nit's going to materialize, and then get out of my way, for I'll be a\nwhirling, irresponsible lunatic, with the wild joy of it. Oh I've got\nfaith in that kiss of yours, Ruth! It's on the way. The fates have\nbooked it. There isn't a reason on earth why I should be served so\nscurvy a trick as to miss it, and I never will believe that I shall----”\n\n“David,” interrupted the Girl, “go on talking and don't move a muscle,\njust reach over presently and fix the fire or something, and then turn\nnaturally and look at the window beside your door.”\n\n“Shall miss it,” said the Harvester steadily. “That would be too\nunmerciful. What do you see, Ruth?”\n\n“A face. If I am not greatly mistaken, it is my Uncle Henry and he\nappears like a perfect fiend. Oh David, I am afraid!”\n\n“Be quiet and don't look,” said the Harvester.\n\nHe turned and tossed a piece of bark on the fire. Then he reached for\nthe poker, pushed it down and stirred the coals. He arose as he worked.\n\n“Rise slowly and quietly and go to your room. Stay there until I call\nyou.”\n\nWith the Girl out of the way, the Harvester pottered over the fire, and\nwhen the flame leaped he lifted a stick of wood, hesitated as if it were\ntoo small, and laying it down, started to bring a larger one. In the\ndining-room he caught a small stick from the wood box, softly stepped\nfrom the door, and ran around the house. But he awakened Belshazzar on\nthe kitchen floor, and the dog barked and ran after him. By the time the\nHarvester reached the corner of his room the man leaped upon a horse and\nwent racing down the drive. The Harvester flung the stick of wood, but\nmissed the man and hit the horse. The dog sprang past the Harvester and\nvanished. There was the sound and flash of a revolver, and the rattle\nof the bridge as the horse crossed it. The dog came back unharmed. The\nHarvester ran to the telephone, called the Onabasha police, and asked\nthem to send a mounted man to meet the intruder before he could reach a\ncross road; but they were too slow and missed him. However, the Girl was\ncertain she had recognized her uncle, and was extremely nervous; but the\nHarvester only laughed and told her it was a trip made out of curiosity.\nHer uncle wanted to see if he could learn if she were well and happy,\nand he finally convinced her that this was the case, although he was not\nvery sanguine himself.\n\nFor the next three days the Harvester worked in the woods and he kept\nthe Girl with him every minute. By the end of that time he really had\npersuaded himself that it was merely curiosity. So through the cooling\nfall days they worked together. They were very happy. Before her\nwondering eyes the Harvester hung queer branches, burs, nuts, berries,\nand trailing vines with curious seed pods. There were masses of\nbrilliant flowers, most of them strange to the Girl, many to the great\naverage of humanity. While she sat bending over them, beside her the\nHarvester delved in the black earth of the woods, or the clay and sand\nof the open hillside, or the muck of the lake shore, and lifted large\nbagfuls of roots that he later drenched on the floating raft on the\nlake, and when they had drained he dried them. Some of them he did not\nwet, but scraped and wiped clean and dry. Often after she was sleeping,\nand long before she awoke in the morning, he was at work carry-ing\nheaped trays from the evaporator to the store-room, and tying the roots,\nleaves, bark, and seeds into packages.\n\nWhile he gathered trillium roots the Girl made drawings of the plant\nand learned its commercial value. She drew lady's slipper and Solomon's\nseal, and learned their uses and prices; and carefully traced wild\nginger leaves while nibbling the aromatic root. It was difficult to keep\nfrom protesting when the work carried them around the lake shore and\nto the pokeberry beds, for the colour of these she loved. It required\ncareful explanation as to the value of the roots and seeds as blood\npurifier, and the argument that in a few more days the frost would level\nthe bed, to induce her to consent to its harvesting. But when the\ncase was properly presented, she put aside her drawing and stained her\nslender fingers gathering the seeds, and loved the work.\n\nThe sun was golden on the lake, the birds of the upland were clustering\nover reeds and rushes, for the sake of plentiful seed and convenient\nwater. Many of them sang fitfully, the notes of almost all of them were\nmelodious, and the day was a long, happy dream. There was but little\nleft to gather until ginseng time. For that the Harvester had engaged\nseveral boys to help him, for the task of digging the roots, washing and\ndrying them, burying part of the seeds and preparing the remainder\nfor market seemed endless for one man to attempt. After a full day the\nHarvester lay before the fire, and his head was so close the Girl's knee\nthat her fingers were in reach of his hair. Every time he mended the\nfire he moved a little, until he could feel the touch of her garments\nagainst him. Then he began to plan for the winter; how they would store\nfood for the long, cold days, how much fuel would be required, when they\nwould go to the city for their winter clothing, what they would read,\nand how they would work together at the drawings.\n\n“I am almost too anxious to wait longer to get back to my carving,” he\nsaid. “Whoever would have thought this spring that fall would come\nand find the birds talking of going, the caterpillars spinning winter\nquarters, the animals holing up, me getting ready for the cold, and your\ncandlesticks not finished. Winter is when you really need them. Then\nthere is solid cheer in numbers of candles and a roaring wood fire. The\nfurnace is going to be a good thing to keep the floors and the bathroom\nwarm, but an open fire of dry, crackling wood is the only rational\nsource of heat in a home. You must watch for the fairy dances on the\nbackwall, Ruth, and learn to trace goblin faces in the coals. Sometimes\nthere is a panorama of temples and trees, and you will find exquisite\ncolour in the smoke. Dry maple makes a lovely lavender, soft and fine as\na floating veil, and damp elm makes a blue, and hickory red and yellow.\nI almost can tell which wood is burning after the bark is gone, by the\nsmoke and flame colour. When the little red fire fairies come out and\ndance on the backwall it is fun to figure what they are celebrating. By\nthe way, Ruth, I have been a lamb for days. I hope you have observed!\nBut I would sleep a little sounder to-night if you only could give me a\nhint whether that kiss is coming on at all.”\n\nHe tipped back his head to see her face, and it was glorious in the red\nfirelight; the big eyes never appeared so deep and dark. The tilted head\nstruck her hand, and her fingers ran through his hair.\n\n“You said to forget it,” she reminded him, “and then it would come\nsooner.”\n\n“Which same translated means that it is not here yet. Well, I didn't\nexpect it, so I am not disappointed; but begorry, I do wish it would\nmaterialize by Christmas. I think I will work for that. Wouldn't it make\na day worth while, though? By the way, what do you want for Christmas,\nRuth?”\n\n“A doll,” she answered.\n\nThe Harvester laughed. He tipped his head again to see her face and\nsuddenly grew quiet, for it was very serious.\n\n“I am quite in earnest,” she said. “I think the big dolls in the stores\nare beautiful, and I never owned only a teeny little one. All my life\nI've wanted a big doll as badly as I ever longed for anything that was\nnot absolutely necessary to keep me alive. In fact, a doll is essential\nto a happy childhood. The mother instinct is so ingrained in a girl that\nif she doesn't have dolls to love, even as a baby, she is deprived of a\npart of her natural rights. It's a pitiful thing to have been the little\ngirl in the picture who stands outside the window and gazes with longing\nsoul at the doll she is anxious to own and can't ever have. Harvester,\nI was always that little girl. I am quite in earnest. I want a big,\nbeautiful doll more than anything else.”\n\nAs she talked the Girl's fingers were idly threading the Harvester's\nhair. His head lightly touched her knee, and she shifted her position\nto afford him a comfortable resting place. With a thrill of delight that\nshook him, the man laid his head in her lap and looked into the fire,\nhis face glowing as a happy boy's.\n\n“You shall have the loveliest doll that money can buy, Ruth,” he\npromised. “What else do you want?”\n\n“A roasted goose, plum pudding, and all those horrid indigestible things\nthat Christmas stories always tell about; and popcorn balls, and candy,\nand everything I've always wanted and never had, and a long beautiful\nday with you. That's all!”\n\n“Ruth, I'm so happy I almost wish I could go to Heaven right now before\nanything occurs to spoil this,” said the Harvester.\n\nThe wheels of a car rattled across the bridge. He whirled to his knees,\nand put his arms around the Girl.\n\n“Ruth,” he said huskily. “I'll wager a thousand dollars I know what is\ncoming. Hug me tight, quick! and give me the best kiss you can----any\nold kind of a one, so you touch my lips with yours before I've got to\nopen that door and let in trouble.”\n\nThe Girl threw her arms around his neck and with the imprint of her lips\nwarm on his the Harvester crossed the room, and his heart dropped from\nthe heights with a thud. He stepped out, closing the door behind him,\nand crossing the veranda, passed down the walk. He recognized the car\nas belonging to a garage in Onabasha, and in it sat two men, one of whom\nspoke.\n\n“Are you David Langston?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester.\n\n“Did you send a couple of photographs to a New York detective agency a\nfew days ago with inquiries concerning some parties you wanted located?”\n\n“I did,” said the Harvester. “But I was not expecting any such immediate\nreturns.”\n\n“Your questions touched on a case that long has been in the hands of the\nagency, and they telegraphed the parties. The following day the people\nhad a letter, giving them the information they required, from another\nsource.”\n\n“That is where Uncle Henry showed his fine Spencerian hand,” commented\nthe Harvester. “It always will be a great satisfaction that I got my\nfist in first.”\n\n“Is Miss Jameson here?”\n\n“No,” said the Harvester. “My wife is at home. Her surname was Ruth\nJameson, but we have been married since June. Did you wish to speak with\nMrs. Langston?”\n\n“I came for that purpose. My name is Kennedy. I am the law partner and\nthe closest friend of the young lady's grandfather. News of her location\nhas prostrated her grandmother so that he could not leave her, and I was\nsent to bring the young woman.”\n\n“Oh!” said the Harvester. “Well you will have to interview her about\nthat. One word first. She does not know that I sent those pictures and\nmade that inquiry. One other word. She is just recovering from a case of\nfever, induced by wrong conditions of life before I met her. She is not\nso strong as she appears. Understand you are not to be abrupt. Go very\ngently! Her feelings and health must be guarded with extreme care.”\n\nThe Harvester opened the door, and as she saw the stranger, the Girl's\neyes widened, and she arose and stood waiting.\n\n“Ruth,” said the Harvester, “this is a man who has been making quite a\nsearch for you, and at last he has you located.”\n\nThe Harvester went to the Girl's side, and put a reinforcing arm around\nher.\n\n“Perhaps he brings you some news that will make life most interesting\nand very lovely for you. Will you shake hands with Mr. Kennedy?”\n\nThe Girl suddenly straightened to unusual height.\n\n“I will hear why he has been making 'quite a search for me,' and on\nwhose authority he has me 'located,' first,” she said.\n\nA diabolical grin crossed the face of the Harvester, and he took heart.\n\n“Then please be seated, Mr. Kennedy,” he said, “and we will talk over\nthe matter. As I understand, you are a representative of my wife's\npeople.”\n\nThe Girl stared at the Harvester.\n\n“Take your chair, Ruth, and meet this as a matter of course,” he\nadvised casually. “You always have known that some day it must come.\nYou couldn't look in the face of those photographs of your mother in her\nyouth and not realize that somewhere hearts were aching and breaking,\nand brains were busy in a search for her.”\n\nThe Girl stood rigid.\n\n“I want it distinctly understood,” she said, “that I have no use on\nearth for my mother's people. They come too late. I absolutely refuse to\nsee or to hold any communication with them.”\n\n“But young lady, that is very arbitrary!” cried Mr. Kennedy. “You don't\nunderstand! They are a couple of old people, and they are slowly dying\nof broken hearts!”\n\n“Not so badly broken or they wouldn't die slowly,” commented the Girl\ngrimly. “The heart that was really broken was my mother's. The torture\nof a starved, overworked body and hopeless brain was hers. There was\nnothing slow about her death, for she went out with only half a life\nspent, and much of that in acute agony, because of their negligence.\nDavid, you often have said that this is my home. I choose to take you at\nyour word. Will you kindly tell this man that he is not welcome in this\nhouse, and I wish him to leave it at once?”\n\nThe Harvester stepped back, and his face grew very white.\n\n“I can't, Ruth,” he said gently.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because I brought him here.”\n\n“You brought him here! You! David, are you crazy? You!”\n\n“It is through me that he came.”\n\nThe Girl caught the mantel for support.\n\n“Then I stand alone again,” she said. “Harvester, I had thought you were\non my side.”\n\n“I am at your feet,” said the man in a broken voice. “Ruth dear, will\nyou let me explain?”\n\n“There is only one explanation, and with what you have done for me fresh\nin my mind, I can't put it into words.”\n\n“Ruth, hear me!”\n\n“I must! You force me! But before you speak understand this: Not now, or\nthrough all eternity, do I forgive the inexcusable neglect that drove my\nmother to what I witnessed and was helpless to avert.”\n\n“My dear! My dear!” said the Harvester, “I had hoped the woods had done\na more perfect work in your heart. Your mother is lying in state now,\nGirl, safe from further suffering of any kind; and if I read aright, her\ntired face and shrivelled frame were eloquent of forgiveness. Ruth dear,\nif she so loved them that her heart was broken and she died for them,\nthink what they are suffering! Have some mercy on them.”\n\n“Get this very clear, David,” said the Girl. “She died of hunger\nfor food. Her heart was not so broken that she couldn't have lived a\nlifetime, and got much comfort out of it, if her body had not lacked\nsustenance. Oh I was so happy a minute ago. David, why did you do this\nthing?”\n\nThe Harvester picked up the Girl, placed her in a chair, and knelt\nbeside her with his arms around her.\n\n“Because of the PAIN IN THE WORLD, Ruth,” he said simply. “Your mother\nis sleeping sweetly in the long sleep that knows neither anger nor\nresentment; and so I was forced to think of a gentle-faced, little\nold mother whose heart is daily one long ache, whose eyes are dim with\ntears, and a proud, broken old man who spends his time trying to comfort\nher, when his life is as desolate as hers.”\n\n“How do you know so wonderfully much about their aches and broken\nhearts?”\n\n“Because I have seen their faces when they were happy, Ruth, and so I\nknow what suffering would do to them. There were pictures of them and\nletters in the bottom of that old trunk. I searched it the other night\nand found them; and by what life has done to your mother and to you, I\ncan judge what it is now bringing them. Never can you be truly happy,\nRuth, until you have forgiven them, and done what you can to comfort the\nremainder of their lives. I did it because of the pain in the world, my\ngirl.”\n\n“What about my pain?”\n\n“The only way on earth to cure it is through forgiveness. That, and that\nonly, will ease it all away, and leave you happy and free for life and\nlove. So long as you let this rancour eat in your heart, Ruth, you are\nnot, and never can be, normal. You must forgive them, dear, hear what\nthey have to say, and give them the comfort of seeing what they can\ndiscover of her in you. Then your heart will be at rest at last, your\nsoul free, you can take your rightful place in life, and the love\nyou crave will awaken in your heart. Ruth, dear you are the acme of\ngentleness and justice. Be just and gentle now! Give them their chance!\nMy heart aches, and always will ache for the pain you have known, but\nnursing and brooding over it will not cure it. It is going to take a\nheroic operation to cut it out, and I chose to be the surgeon. You have\nsaid that I once saved your body from pain Ruth, trust me now to free\nyour soul.”\n\n“What do you want?”\n\n“I want you to speak kindly to this man, who through my act has come\nhere, and allow him to tell you why he came. Then I want you to do the\nkind and womanly thing your duty suggests that you should.”\n\n“David, I don t understand you!”\n\n“That is no difference,” said the Harvester. “The point is, do you TRUST\nme?”\n\nThe Girl hesitated. “Of course I do,” she said at last.\n\n“Then hear what your grandfather's friend has come to say for him, and\nforget yourself in doing to others as you would have them----really,\nRuth, that is all of religion or of life worth while. Go on, Mr.\nKennedy.”\n\nThe Harvester drew up a chair, seated himself beside the Girl, and\ntaking one of her hands, he held it closely and waited.\n\n“I was sent here by my law partner and my closest friend, Mr. Alexander\nHerron, of Philadelphia,” said the stranger. “Both he and Mrs. Herron\nwere bitterly opposed to your mother's marriage, because they knew life\nand human nature, and there never is but one end to men such as she\nmarried.”\n\n“You may omit that,” said the Girl coldly. “Simply state why you are\nhere.”\n\n“In response to an inquiry from your husband concerning the originals\nof some photographs he sent to a detective agency in New York. They have\nhad the case for years, and recognizing the pictures as a clue, they\ntelegraphed Mr. Herron. The prospect of news after years of fruitless\nsearching so prostrated Mrs. Herron that he dared not leave her, and he\nsent me.”\n\n“Kindly tell me this,” said the Girl. “Where were my mother's father and\nmother for the four years immediately following her marriage?”\n\n“They went to Europe to avoid the humiliation of meeting their friends.\nThere, in Italy, Mrs. Herron developed a fever, and it was several years\nbefore she could be brought home. She retired from society, and has been\nconfined to her room ever since. When they could return, a search was\ninstituted at once for their daughter, but they never have been able to\nfind a trace. They have hunted through every eastern city they thought\nmight contain her.”\n\n“And overlooked a little insignificant place like Chicago, of course.”\n\n“I myself conducted a personal search there, and visited the home of\nevery Jameson in the directory or who had mail at the office or of whom\nI could get a clue of any sort.”\n\n“I don't suppose two women in a little garret room would be in the\ndirectory, and there never was any mail.”\n\n“Did your mother ever appeal to her parents?”\n\n“She did,” said the Girl. “She admitted that she had been wrong, asked\ntheir forgiveness, and begged to go home. That was in the second year of\nher marriage, and she was in Cleveland. Afterward she went to Chicago,\nfrom there she wrote again.”\n\n“Her father and mother were in Italy fighting for the mother's life,\ntwo years after that. It is very easy to become lost in a large city.\nCriminals do it every day and are never found, even with the best\ndetectives on their trail. I am very sorry about this. My friends will\nbe broken-hearted. At any time they would have been more than delighted\nto have had their daughter return. A letter on the day following the\nmessage from the agency brought news that she was dead, and now their\nonly hope for any small happiness at the close of years of suffering\nlies with you. I was sent to plead with you to return with me at once\nand make them a visit. Of course, their home is yours. You are their\nonly heir, and they would be very happy if you were free, and would\nremain permanently with them.”\n\n“How do they know I will not be like the father they so detested?”\n\n“They had sufficient cause to dislike him. They have every reason to\nlove and welcome you. They are consumed with anxiety. Will you come?”\n\n“No. This is for me to decide. I do not care for them or their property.\nAlways they have failed me when my distress was unspeakable. Now there\nis only one thing I ask of life, more than my husband has given me, and\nif that lay in his power I would have it. You may go back and tell them\nthat I am perfectly happy. I have everything I need. They can give me\nnothing I want, not even their love. Perhaps, sometime, I will go to see\nthem for a few days, if David will go with me.”\n\n“Young woman, do you realize that you are issuing a death sentence?”\n asked the lawyer gently.\n\n“It is a just one.”\n\n“I do not believe your husband agrees with you. I know I do not. Mrs.\nHerron is a tiny old lady, with a feeble spark of vitality left; and\nwith all her strength she is clinging to life, and pleading with it to\ngive her word of her only child before she goes out unsatisfied. She\nknows that her daughter is gone, and now her hopes are fastened on you.\nIf for only a few days, you certainly must go with me.”\n\n“I will not!”\n\nThe lawyer turned to the Harvester.\n\n“She will be ready to start with you to-morrow morning, on the first\ntrain north,” said the Harvester. “We will meet you at the station at\neight.”\n\n“I----I am afraid I forgot to tell my driver to wait.”\n\n“You mean your instructions were not to let the Girl out of your sight,”\n said the Harvester. “Very well! We have comfortable rooms. I will show\nyou to one. Please come this way.”\n\nThe Harvester led the guest to the lake room and arranged for the night.\nThen he went to the telephone and sent a message to an address he had\nbeen furnished, asking for an immediate reply. It went to Philadelphia\nand contained a description of the lawyer, and asked if he had been\nsent by Mr. Herron to escort his grand-daughter to his home. When the\nHarvester returned to the living-room the Girl, white and defiant,\nwaited before the fire. He knelt beside her and put his arms around her,\nbut she repulsed him; so he sat on the rug and looked at her.\n\n“No wonder you felt sure you knew what that was!” she cried bitterly.\n\n“Ruth, if you will allow me to lift the bottom of that old trunk, and if\nyou will read any one of the half dozen letters I read, you will forgive\nme, and begin making preparations to go.”\n\n“It's a wonder you don't hold them before me and force me to read them,”\n she said.\n\n“Don't say anything you will be sorry for after you are gone, dear.”\n\n“I'm not going!”\n\n“Oh yes you are!”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because it is right that you should, and right is inexorable. Also,\nbecause I very much wish you to; you will do it for me.”\n\n“Why do you want me to go?”\n\n“I have three strong reasons: First, as I told you, it is the only thing\nthat will cleanse your heart of bitterness and leave it free for the\ntenanting of a great and holy love. Next, I think they honestly made\nevery effort to find your mother, and are now growing old in despair you\ncan lighten, and you owe it to them and yourself to do it. Lastly, for\nmy sake. I've tried everything I know, Ruth, and I can't make you love\nme, or bring you to a realizing sense of it if you do. So before I saw\nthat chest I had planned to harvest my big crop, and try with all my\nheart while I did it, and if love hadn't come then, I meant to get\nsome one to stay with you, and I was going away to give you a free\nperspective for a time. I meant to plead that I needed a few weeks with\na famous chemist I know to prepare me better for my work. My real motive\nwas to leave you, and let you see if absence could do anything for me in\nyour heart. You've been very nearly the creature of my hands for months,\nmy girl; whatever any one else may do, you're bound to miss me mightily,\nand I figured that with me away, perhaps you could solve the problem\nalone I seem to fail in helping you with. This is only a slight change\nof plans. You are going in my stead. I will harvest the ginseng and\ncure it, and then, if you are not at home, and the loneliness grows\nunbearable, I will take the chemistry course, until you decide when you\nwill come, if ever.”\n\n“'If ever?'”\n\n“Yes,” said the Harvester. “I am growing accustomed to facing big\npropositions----I will not dodge this. The faces of the three of your\npeople I have seen prove refinement. Their clothing indicates wealth.\nThese long, lonely years mean that they will shower you with every\noutpouring of loving, hungry hearts. They will keep you if they can, my\ndear. I do not blame them. The life I propose for you is one of work,\nmostly for others, and the reward, in great part, consists of the joy in\nthe soul of the creator of things that help in the world. I realize that\nyou will find wealth, luxury, and lavish love. I know that I may lose\nyou forever, and if it is right and best for you, I hope I will. I know\nexactly what I am risking, but I yet say, go.”\n\n“I don't see how you can, and love me as you prove you do.”\n\n“That is a little streak of the inevitableness of nature that the forest\nhas ground into my soul. I'd rather cut off my right hand than take\nyours with it, in the parting that will come in the morning; but you are\ngoing, and I am sending you. So long as I am shaped like a human being,\nit is in me to dignify the possession of a vertical spine by acting as\nnearly like a man as I know how. I insist that you are my wife, because\nit crucifies me to think otherwise. I tell you to-night, Ruth, you are\nnot and never have been. You are free as air. You married me without any\nlove for me in your heart, and you pretended none. It was all my doing.\nIf I find that I was wrong, I will free you without a thought of results\nto me. I am a secondary proposition. I thought then that you were alone\nand helpless, and before the Almighty, I did the best I could. But I\nknow now that you are entitled to the love of relatives, wealth, and\nhigh social position, no doubt. If I allowed the passion in my heart\nto triumph over the reason of my brain, and worked on your feelings and\ntied you to the woods, without knowing but that you might greatly prefer\nthat other life you do not know, but to which you are entitled, I would\ngo out and sink myself in Loon Lake.”\n\n“David, I love you. I do not want to go. Please, please let me remain\nwith you.”\n\n“Not if you could say that realizing what it means, and give me the kiss\nright now I would stake my soul to win! Not by any bribe you can think\nof or any allurement you can offer. It is right that you go to those\nsuffering old people. It is right you know what you are refusing for me,\nbefore you renounce it. It is right you take the position to which you\nare entitled, until you understand thoroughly whether this suits you\nbetter. When you know that life as well as this, the people you will\nmeet as intimately as me, then you can decide for all time, and I can\nlook you in the face with honest, unwavering eye; and if by any chance\nyour heart is in the woods, and you prefer me and the cabin to what they\nhave to offer----to all eternity your place here is vacant, Ruth. My\nlove is waiting for you; and if you come under those conditions, I never\ncan have any regret. A clear conscience is worth restraining passion a\nfew months to gain, and besides, I always have got the fact to face that\nwhen you say 'I love,' and when I say 'I love,' it means two entirely\ndifferent things. When you realize that the love of man for woman, and\nwoman for man, is a thing that floods the heart, brain, soul, and body\nwith a wonderful and all-pervading ecstasy, and if I happen to be the\nman who makes you realize it, then come tell me, and we will show\nGod and His holy angels what earth means by the Heaven inspired word,\n'radiance.'”\n\n“David, there never will be any other man like you.”\n\n“The exigencies of life must develop many a finer and better.”\n\n“You still refuse me? You yet believe I do not love you?”\n\n“Not with the love I ask, my girl. But if I did not believe it was\ngerminating in your heart, and that it would come pouring over me in a\ntorrent some glad day, I doubt if I could allow you to go, Ruth! I am\nlike any other man in selfishness and in the passions of the body.”\n\n“Selfishness! You haven't an idea what it means,” said the Girl. “And\nwhat you call love----there I haven't. But I know how to appreciate you,\nand you may be positively sure that it will be only a few days until I\nwill come back to you.”\n\n“But I don't want you until you can bring the love I crave. I am sending\nyou to remain until that time, Ruth.”\n\n“But it may be months, Man!”\n\n“Then stay months.”\n\n“But it may be----”\n\n“It may be never! Then remain forever. That will be proof positive that\nyour happiness does not lie in my hands.”\n\n“Why should I not consider you as you do me?”\n\n“Because I love you, and you do not love me.”\n\n“You are cruel to yourself and to me. You talk about the pain in the\nworld. What about the pain in my heart right now? And if I know you in\nthe least, one degree more would make you cry aloud for mercy. Oh David,\nare we of no consideration at all?”\n\nThe muscles of the Harvester's face twisted an instant.\n\n“This is where we lop off the small branches to grow perfect fruit\nlater. This is where we do evil that good may result. This is where\nwe suffer to-night in order we may appreciate fully the joy of love's\ndawning. If I am causing you pain, forgive me, dear heart. I would give\nmy life to prevent it, but I am powerless. It is right! We cannot avoid\ndoing it, if we ever would be happy.”\n\nHe picked up the Girl, and held her crushed in his arms a long time.\nThen he set her inside her door and said, “Lay out what you want to take\nand I will help you pack, so that you can get some sleep. We must be\nready early in the morning.”\n\nWhen the clothing to be worn was selected, the new trunk packed, and all\narrangements made, the Girl sat in his arms before the fire as he had\nheld her when she was ill, and then he sent her to bed and went to\nthe lake shore to fight it out alone. Only God and the stars and the\nfaithful Belshazzar saw the agony of a strong man in his extremity.\n\nNear dawn he heard the tinkle of the bell and went to receive his\nmessage and order a car for morning. Then he returned to the merciful\ndarkness of night, and paced the driveway until light came peeping over\nthe tree tops. He prepared breakfast and an hour later put the Girl on\nthe train, and stood watching it until the last rift of smoke curled\nabove the spires of the city.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. THE MAN IN THE BACKGROUND\n\nThen the Harvester returned to Medicine Woods to fight his battle alone.\nAt first the pain seemed unendurable, but work always had been his\npanacea, it was his salvation now. He went through the cabin, folding\nbedding and storing it in closets, rolling rugs sprinkled with powdered\nalum, packing cushions, and taking window seats from the light.\n\n“Our sleeping room and the kitchen will serve for us, Bel,” he said. “We\nwill put all these other things away carefully, so they will be as good\nas new when the Girl comes home.”\n\nThe evening of the second day he was called to the telephone.\n\n“There is a telegram for you,” said a voice. “A message from\nPhiladelphia. It reads: 'Arrived safely. Thank you for making me come.\nDear old people. Will write soon. With love, Ruth.'\n\n“Have you got it?”\n\n“No,” lied the Harvester, grinning rapturously. “Repeat it again slowly,\nand give me time after each sentence to write it. Now! Go on!”\n\nHe carried the message to the back steps and sat reading it again and\nagain.\n\n“I supposed I'd have to wait at least four days,” he said to Ajax as the\nbird circled before him. “This is from the Girl, old man, and she is\nnot forgetting us to begin with, anyway. She is there all safe, she sees\nthat they need her, they are lovable old people, she is going to write\nus all about it soon, and she loves us all she knows how to love any\none. That should be enough to keep us sane and sensible until her letter\ncomes. There is no use to borrow trouble, so we will say everything in\nthe world is right with us, and be as happy as we can on that until we\nfind something we cannot avoid worrying over. In the meantime, we will\nhave faith to believe that we have suffered our share, and the end will\nbe happy for all of us. I am mighty glad the Girl has a home, and the\nright kind of people to care for her. Now, when she comes back to me, I\nneedn't feel that she was forced, whether she wanted to or not, because\nshe had nowhere to go. This will let me out with a clean conscience, and\nthat is the only thing on earth that allows a man to live in peace with\nhimself. Now I'll go finish everything else, and then I'll begin the\nginseng harvest.”\n\nSo the Harvester hitched Betsy and with Belshazzar at his feet he drove\nthrough the woods to the sarsaparilla beds. He noticed the beautiful\nlobed leaves, at which the rabbits had been nibbling, and the heads of\nlustrous purple-black berries as he began digging the roots that he sold\nfor stimulants.\n\n“I might have needed a dose of you now myself,” the Harvester addressed\na heap of uprooted plants, “if the electric wires hadn't brought me a\nbetter. Great invention that! Never before realized it fully! I thought\nto-day would be black as night, but that message changes the complexion\nof affairs mightily. So I'll dig you for people who really are in need\nof something to brace them up.”\n\nAfter the sarsaparilla was on the trays, he attacked the beds of Indian\nhemp, with its long graceful pods, and took his usual supply. Then he\nworked diligently on the warm hillside over the dandelion. When these\nwere finished he brought half a dozen young men from the city and\ndrilled them on handling ginseng. He was warm, dirty, and tired when he\ncame from the beds the evening of the fourth day. He finished his work\nat the barn, prepared and ate his supper, slipped into clean clothing,\nand walked to the country road where it crossed the lane. There he\nopened his mail box. The letter he expected with the Philadelphia\npostmark was inside. He carried it to the bridge, and sitting in her\nfavourite place, with the lake breeze threading his hair, opened his\nfirst letter from the Girl.\n\n“My dear Friend, Lover, Husband,” it began.\n\nThe Harvester turned the sheets face down across his knee, laid his hand\non them, and stared meditatively at the lake. “'Friend,'” he commented.\n“Well, that's all right! I am her friend, as well as I know how to be.\n'Lover.' I come in there, full force. I did my level best on that score,\nthough I can't boast myself a howling success; a man can't do more\nthan he knows, and if I had been familiar with all the wiles of expert,\nprofessional love-makers, they wouldn't have availed me in the Girl's\ncondition. I had a mighty peculiar case to handle in her, and not a\nparticle of training. But if she says 'Lover,' I must have made some\nkind of a showing on the job. 'Husband.'” A slow flush crept up the\nbrawny neck and tinged the bronzed face. “That's a good word,” said\nthe Harvester, “and it must mean a wonderful thing----to some men. 'Who\nbides his time.' Well, I'm 'biding,' and if my time ever comes to be my\nDream Girl's husband, I'll wager all I'm worth on one thing. I'll study\nthe job from every point of the compass, and I'll see what showing I can\nmake on being the kind of a husband that a woman clings to and loves at\neighty.”\n\nTaking a deep breath the Harvester lifted the letter, and laying one\nhand on Belshazzar's head, he proceeded----“I might as well admit in the\nbeginning that I cried most of the way here. Some of it was because I\nwas nervous and dreaded the people I would meet, and more on account of\nwhat I felt toward them, but most of it was because I did not want to\nleave you. I have been spoiled dreadfully! You have taught me so to\ndepend on you----and for once I feel that I really can claim to have\nbeen an apt pupil----that it was like having the heart torn out of me to\ncome. I want you to know this, because it will teach you that I have\na little bit of appreciation of how good you are to me, and to all the\nworld as well. I am glad that I almost cried myself sick over leaving\nyou. I wish now I just had stood up in the car, and roared like a burned\nbaby.\n\n“But all the tears I shed in fear of grandfather and grandmother were\nwasted. They are a couple of dear old people, and it would have been a\ncrime to allow them to suffer more than they must of necessity. It all\nseems so different when they talk; and when I see the home, luxuries,\nand friends my mother had, it appears utterly incomprehensible that she\ndared leave them for a stranger. Probably the reason she did was because\nshe was grandfather's daughter. He is gentle and tender some of the\ntime, but when anything irritates him, and something does every few\nminutes, he breaks loose, and such another explosion you never heard. It\ndoes not mean a thing, and it seems to lower his tension enough to keep\nhim from bursting with palpitation of the heart or something, but it is\na strain for others. At first it frightened me dreadfully. Grandmother\nis so tiny and frail, so white in her big bed, and when he is the very\nworst, and she only smiles at him, why I know he does not mean it at\nall. But, David, I hope you never will get an idea that this would be\na pleasant way for you to act, because it would not, and I never would\nhave the courage to offer you the love I have come to find if you\nslammed a cane and yelled, 'demnation,' at me. Grandmother says she does\nnot mind at all, but I wonder if she did not acquire the habit of lying\nin bed because it is easier to endure in a prostrate position.\n\n“The house is so big I get lost, and I do not know yet which are\nservants and which friends; and there is a steady stream of seamstresses\nand milliners making things for me. Grandmother and father both think I\nwill be quite passable in appearance when I am what they call 'modishly\ndressed.' I think grandmother will forget herself some day and leave her\nbed before she knows it, in her eagerness to see how something appears.\nI could not begin to tell you about all the lovely things to wear, for\nevery occasion under the sun, and they say these are only temporary,\nuntil some can be made especially for me.\n\n“They divide the time in sections, and there is an hour to drive, I am\nto have a horse and ride later, and a time to shop, so long to visit\ngrandmother, and set hours to sleep, dress, to be fitted, taken to see\nthings, music lessons, and a dancing teacher. I think a longer day will\nhave to be provided.\n\n“I do not care anything about dancing. I know what would make me dance\nnicely enough for anything, but I am going to try the music, and see if\nI can learn just a few little songs and some old melodies for evening,\nwhen the work is done, the fire burns low, and you are resting on the\nrug. There is enough room for a piano between your door and the south\nwall and that corner seems vacant anyway. You would like it, David, I\nknow, if I could play and sing just enough to put you to sleep nicely.\nIt is in the back of my head that I will try to do every single thing,\njust as they want me to, and that will make them happy, but never forget\nthat the instant I feel in my soul that your kiss is right on my lips,\nI am coming to you by lightning express; and I told them so the first\nthing, and that I only came because you made me.\n\n“They did not raise an objection, but I am not so dull that I cannot see\nthey are trying to bind me to them from the very first with chains too\nstrong to break. We had just one little clash. Grandfather was mightily\npleased over what you told Mr. Kennedy about my never having been your\nwife, and that I was really free. There seems to be a man, the son\nof his partner, whom grandfather dearly loves, and he wants me to\nbe friends with his friend. One can see at once what he is planning,\nbecause he said he was going to introduce me as Miss Jameson. I told\nhim that would be creating a false impression, because I was a married\nwoman; but he only laughed at me and went straight to doing it.\n\n“Of course, I know why, but he is so terribly set I cannot stop him, so\nI shall have to tell people myself that I am a staid, old married lady.\nAfter all, I suppose I might as well let him go, if it pleases him. I\nshall know how to protect myself and any one else, from any mistakes\nconcerning me; and in my heart I know what I know, and what I cannot\nmake you believe, but I will some day.\n\n“I suspect you're harvesting the ginseng now. The roar and rush of the\ncity seem strange, as if I never had heard it before, and I feel so\ncrowded. I scarcely can sleep at night for the clamour of the cars,\ncabs, and throbbing life. Grandfather will not hear a word, and he just\nsputters and says 'demnation' when I try to tell him about you; but\ngrandmother will listen, and I talk to her of you and Medicine Woods by\nthe hour. She says she thinks you must be a wonderfully nice person. I\nhaven't dared tell her yet the thing that will win her. She is so little\nand frail, and she has heart trouble so badly; but some day I shall\ntell her all about Chicago that I can, and then of Uncle Henry, and then\nabout you and the oak, and that will make her love you as I do. There\nare so many things to do; they have sent for me three times. I shall\ntell them they must put you on the schedule, and give me so much time to\nwrite or I will upset the whole programme.\n\n“I think you will like to know that Mr. Kennedy told grandfather all you\nsaid to him about my illness, for almost as soon as I came he brought\na very wonderful man to my room, and he asked many questions and I\ntold him all about it, and what I had been doing. He made out a list of\nthings to eat and exercises. I am being taken care of just as you did,\nso I will go on growing well and strong. The trouble is they are too\ngood to me. I would just love to shuffle my feet in dead leaves, and lie\non the grass this morning. I never got my swim in the lake. I will have\nto save that until next summer. He also told grandfather what you said\nabout Uncle Henry, and I think he was pleased that you tried to find him\nas soon as you knew. He let me see the letter Uncle Henry wrote, and it\nwas a vile thing----just such as he would write. It asked how much he\nwould be willing to pay for information concerning his heir. I told\ngrandfather all about it, and I saw the answer he wrote. I told him some\nthings to say, and one of them was that the honesty of a man without\na price prevented the necessity of anything being paid to find me. The\nother was that you located my people yourself, and at once sent me to\nthem against my wishes. I was determined he should know that. So Uncle\nHenry missed his revenge on you. He evidently thought he not only would\nhurt you by breaking up your home and separating us, but also he would\nget a reward for his work. He wrote some untrue things about you, and I\nwish he hadn't, for grandfather can think of enough himself. But I will\nsoon change that. Please, please take good care of all my things, my\nflowers and vines, and most of all tell Belshazzar to protect you with\nhis life. And you be very good to my dear, dear lover. I will write\nagain soon, Ruth.”\n\nWhen the Harvester had studied the letter until he could repeat\nit backward, he went to the cabin and answered it. Then he sent\nsubscriptions for two of Philadelphia's big dailies, and harvested\nginseng from dawn until black darkness. Never was such a crop grown in\nAmerica. The beds had been made in the original home of the plant, so\nthat it throve under perfectly natural conditions in the forest, but\nhere and there branches had been thinned above, and nature helped by\nscience below. This resulted in thick, pulpy roots of astonishing size\nand weight. As the Harvester lifted them he bent the tops and buried\npart of the seed for another crop. For weeks he worked over the bed.\nThen the last load went down the hill to the dry-house and the helpers\nwere paid. Next the fall work was finished. Fuel and food were stored\nfor winter, while the cold crept from the lake, swept down the hill and\nsurrounded the cabin.\n\nThe Harvester finished long days in the dry-house and store-room, and\nafter supper he sat by the fire reading over the Girl's letters, carving\non her candlesticks, or in the work room, bending above the boards he\nwas shaving and polishing for a gift he had planned for her Christmas.\nThe Careys had him in their home for Thanksgiving. He told them all\nabout sending the Girl away himself, read them some of her letters, and\nthey talked with perfect confidence of how soon she would come home.\nThe Harvester tried to think confidently, but as the days went by the\nletters became fewer, always with the excuse that there was no time to\nwrite, but with loving assurance that she was thinking of him and would\ndo better soon.\n\nHowever they came often enough that he had something new to tell his\nfriends so that they did not suspect that waiting was a trial to him. A\nfew days after Thanksgiving the gift that he had planned was finished.\nIt was a big, burl-maple box, designed after the hope chests that he saw\nadvertised in magazines. The wood was rare, cut in heavy slabs, polished\ninside and out, dove-tailed corners with ornate brass bindings, hinges\nand lock, and hand-carved feet. On the inside of the lid cut on a brass\nplate was the inscription, “Ruth Langston, Christmas of Nineteen Hundred\nand Ten. David.”\n\nThen he began packing the chest. He put in the finished candlesticks\nand a box of candleberry dips he had made of delightfully spiced wax,\ncoloured pale green. He ordered the doll weeks before from the largest\nstore in Onabasha, and the dealer brought on several that he might make\na selection. He chose a large baby doll almost life size, and sent it\nto the dress-making department to be completely and exquisitely clothed.\nLong before the day he was picking kernels to glaze from nuts, drying\ncorn to pop, and planning candies to be made of maple sugar. When he\nfigured it was time to start the box, he worked carefully, filling\nspaces with chestnut and hazel burs, and finishing the tops of\nboxes with gaudy red and yellow leaves he had kept in their original\nbrightness by packing them in sand. He put in scarlet berries of\nmountain ash and long twining sprays of yellow and red bitter-sweet\nberries, for her room. Then he carefully covered the chest with cloth,\npacked it in an outside box, and sent it to the Girl by express. As he\ncame from the train shed, where he had helped with loading, he met Henry\nJameson. Instantly the long arm of the Harvester shot out, and in a grip\nthat could not be broken he caught the man by the back of the neck and\nproceeded to dangle him. As he did so he roared with laughter.\n\n“Dear Uncle Henry!” he cried. “How did you feel when you got your letter\nfrom Philadelphia? Wasn't it a crime that an honest man, which same\nrefers to me, beat you? Didn't you gnash your teeth when you learned\nthat instead of separating me from my wife I had found her people and\nsent her to them myself? Didn't it rend your soul to miss your little\nrevenge and fail to get the good, fat reward you confidently expected?\nHo! Ho! Thus are lofty souls downcast. I pity you, Henry Jameson, but\nnot so much that I won't break your back if you meddle in my affairs\nagain, and I am taking this opportunity to tell you so. Here you go out\nof my life, for if you appear in it once more I will finish you like a\ncopperhead. Understand?”\n\nWith a last shake the Harvester dropped him, and went into the express\noffice, where several men had watched the proceedings.\n\n“Been dipping in your affairs, has he?” asked the expressman.\n\n“Trying it,” laughed the Harvester.\n\n“Well he is just moving to Idaho, and you probably won't be bothered\nwith him any more.”\n\n“Good news!” said the Harvester. He felt much relieved as he went back\nto Betsy and drove to Medicine Woods.\n\nThe Careys had invited him, but he chose to spend Christmas alone. He\nhad finished breakfast when the telephone bell rang, and the expressman\ntold him there was a package for him from Philadelphia. The Harvester\nmounted Betsy and rode to the city at once. The package was so very\nsmall he slipped it into his pocket, and went to the doctor's to say\nMerry Christmas! To Mrs. Carey he gave a pretty lavender silk dress, and\nto the doctor a new watch chain. Then he went to the hospital, where\nhe left with Molly a set of china dishes from the Girl, and a fur-lined\ngreat coat, his gift to Doctor Harmon. He rode home and stabled Betsy,\ngiving her an extra quart of oats, and going into the house he sat by\nthe kitchen fire and opened the package.\n\nIn a nest of cotton lay a tissue-wrapped velvet box, and inside that, in\na leather pocket case, an ivory miniature of the Girl by an artist who\nknew how to reproduce life. It was an exquisite picture, and a face\nof wonderful beauty. He looked at it for a long time, and then called\nBelshazzar and carried it out to show Ajax. Then he put it into his\nbreast pocket squarely over his heart, but he wore the case shiny the\nfirst day taking it out. Before noon he went to the mail box and found\na long letter from the Girl, full of life, health, happiness, and with\nsteady assurances of love for him, but there was no mention made of\ncoming home.\n\nShe seemed engrossed in the music lessons, riding, dancing, pretty\nclothing, splendid balls, receptions, and parties of all kinds. The\nHarvester answered it with his heart full of love for her, and then\nwaited. It was a long week before the reply came, and then it was short\non account of so many things that must be done, but she insisted that\nshe was well, happy, and having a fine time. After that the letters\nbecame less frequent and shorter. At times there would be stretches of\nalmost two weeks with not a line, and then only short notes to explain\nthat she was too busy to write.\n\nThrough the dreary, cold days of January and February the Harvester\ninvented work in the store-room, in the workshop, at the candlesticks,\nsat long over great books, and spent hours in the little laboratory\npreparing and compounding drugs. In the evenings he carved and read.\nFirst of all he scanned the society columns of the papers he was taking,\nand almost every day he found the name of Miss Ruth Jameson, often\na paragraph describing her dress and her beauty of face and charm of\nmanner; and constantly the name of Mr. Herbert Kennedy appeared as her\nescort. At first the Harvester ignored this, and said to himself that\nhe was glad she could have enjoyable times and congenial friends, and\nhe was. But as the letters became fewer, paper paragraphs more frequent,\nand approaching spring worked its old insanity in the blood, gradually\nan ache crept into his heart again, and there were days when he could\nnot work it out.\n\nEvery letter she wrote he answered just as warmly as he felt that he\ndared, but when they were so long coming and his heart was overflowing,\nhe picked up a pen one night and wrote what he felt. He told her all\nabout the ice-bound lake, the lonely crows in the big woods, the sap\nsuckers' cry, and the gay cardinals' whistle. He told her about the\ncocoons dangling on bushes or rocking on twigs that he was cutting for\nher. He warned her that spring was coming, and soon she would begin to\nmiss wonders for her pencil. Then he told her about the silent cabin,\nthe empty rooms, and a lonely man. He begged her not to forget the kiss\nshe had gone to find for him. He poured out his heart unrestrainedly,\nand then folded the letter, sealed and addressed it to her, in care of\nthe fire fairies, and pitched it into the ashes of the living-room fire\nplace. But expression made him feel better.\n\nThere was another longer wait for the next letter, but he had written\nher so many in the meantime that a little heap of them had accumulated\nas he passed through the living-room on his way to bed. He had supposed\nshe would be gone until after Christmas when she left, but he never had\nthought of harvesting sassafras and opening the sugar camp alone. In\nthose days his face appeared weary, and white hairs came again on his\ntemples. Carey met him on the street and told him that he was going to\nthe National Convention of Surgeons at New York in March, and wanted him\nto go along and present his new medicine for consideration.\n\n“All right,” said the Harvester instantly, “I will go.”\n\nHe went and interviewed Mrs. Carey, and then visited the doctor's\ntailor, and a shoe store, and bought everything required to put him in\ncondition for travelling in good style, and for the banquet he would\nbe asked to attend. Then he got Mrs. Carey to coach him on spoons and\nforks, and declared he was ready. When the doctor saw that the Harvester\nreally would go, he sat down and wrote the president of the association,\ntelling him in brief outline of Medicine Woods and the man who had\nachieved a wonderful work there, and of the compounding of the new\nremedy.\n\nAs he expected, return mail brought an invitation for the Harvester to\naddress the association and describe his work and methods and present\nhis medicine. The doctor went out in the car over sloppy roads with that\nletter, and located the Harvester in the sugar camp. He explained the\nsituation and to his surprise found his man intensely interested. He\nasked many questions as to the length of time, and amount of detail\nrequired in a proper paper, and the doctor told him.\n\n“But if you want to make a clean sweep, David,” he said, “write your\npaper simply, and practise until it comes easy before you speak.”\n\nThat night the Harvester left work long enough to get a notebook, and by\nthe light of the camp fire, and in company with the owls and coons, he\nwrote his outline. One division described his geographical location,\nanother traced his ancestry and education in wood lore. One was a\ntribute to the mother who moulded his character and ground into him\nstability for his work. The remainder described his methods in growing\ndrugs, drying and packing them, and the end was a presentation for their\nexamination of the remedy that had given life where a great surgeon had\nconceded death. Then he began amplification.\n\nWhen the sugar making was over the Harvester commenced his regular\nspring work, but his mind was so busy over his paper that he did not\nhave much time to realize just how badly his heart was beginning to\nache. Neither did he consign so many letters to the fire fairies, for\nnow he was writing of the best way to dry hydrastis and preserve ginseng\nseed. The day before time to start he drove to Onabasha to try on his\nclothing and have Mrs. Carey see if he had been right in his selections.\n\nWhile he was gone, Granny Moreland, wearing a clean calico dress and\ncarrying a juicy apple pie, came to the stretch of flooded marsh land,\nand finding the path under water, followed the road and crossing a\nfield reached the levee and came to the bridge of Singing Water where it\nentered the lake. She rested a few minutes there, and then went to the\ncabin shining between bare branches. She opened the front door, entered,\nand stood staring around her.\n\n“Why things is all tore up here,” she said. “Now ain't that sensible\nof David to put everything away and save it nice and careful until his\nwoman gets back. Seems as if she's good and plenty long coming; seems\nas if her folks needs her mighty bad, or she's having a better time than\nthe boy is or something.”\n\nShe set the pie on the table, went through the cabin and up the hill\na little distance, calling the Harvester. When she passed the barn\nshe missed Betsy and the wagon, and then she knew he was in town. She\nreturned to the living-room and sat looking at the pie as she rested.\n\n“I'd best put you on the kitchen table,” she mused. “Likely he will see\nyou there first and eat you while you are fresh. I'd hate mortal bad for\nhim to overlook you, and let you get stale, after all the care I've took\nwith your crust, and all the sugar, cinnamon, and butter that's under\nyour lid. You're a mighty nice pie, and you ort to be et hot. Now why\nunder the sun is all them clean letters pitched in the fireplace?”\n\nGranny knelt and selecting one, she blew off the ashes, wiped it with\nher apron and read: “To Ruth, in care of the fire fairies.”\n\n“What the Sam Hill is the idiot writin' his woman like that for?” cried\nGranny, bristling instantly. “And why is he puttin' pages and pages of\ngood reading like this must have in it in care of the fire fairies? Too\nmuch alone, I guess! He's going wrong in his head. Nobody at themselves\nwould do sech a fool trick as this. I believe I had better do something.\nOf course I had! These is writ to Ruth; she ort to have them. Wish't I\nknowed how she gets her mail, I'd send her some. Mebby three! I'd send a\nfat and a lean, and a middlin' so's that she'd have a sample of all the\nkinds they is. It's no way to write letters and pitch them in the ashes.\nIt means the poor boy is honin' to say things he dassent and so he's\nwritin' them out and never sendin' them at all. What's the little huzzy\ngone so long for, anyway? I'll fix her!”\n\nGranny selected three letters, blew away the ashes, and tucked the\nenvelopes inside her dress.\n\n“If I only knowed how to get at her,” she muttered. She stared at the\npie. “I guess you got to go back,” she said, “and be et by me. Like as\nnot I'll stall myself, for I got one a-ready. But if David has got these\nfool things counted and misses any, and then finds that pie here, he'll\ns'picion me. Yes, I got to take you back, and hurry my stumps at that.”\n\nGranny arose with the pie, cast a lingering and covetous glance at the\nfireplace, stooped and took another letter, and then started down the\ndrive. Just as she reached the bridge she looked ahead and saw the\nHarvester coming up the levee. Instantly she shot the pie over the\nrailing and with a groan watched it strike the water and disappear.\n\n“Lord of love!” she gasped, sinking to the seat, “that was one of\ngrandmother's willer plates that I promised Ruth. 'Tain't likely I'll\never see hide ner hair of it again. But they wa'ant no place to put it,\nand I dassent let him know I'd been up to the cabin. Mebby I can fetch\na boy some day and hire him to dive for it. How long can a plate be in\nwater and not get spiled anyway? Now what'll I do? My head's all in a\nwhirl! I'll bet my bosom is a sticking out with his letters 'til he'll\nnotice and take them from me.”\n\nShe gripped her hands across her chest and sat staring at the Harvester\nas he stopped on the bridge, and seeing her attitude and distressed\nface, he sprang from the wagon.\n\n“Why Granny, are you sick?” he cried anxiously.\n\n“Yes!” gasped Granny Moreland. “Yes, David, I am! I'm a miserable woman.\nI never was in sech a shape in all my days.”\n\n“Let me help you to the cabin, and I'll see what I can do for you,”\n offered the Harvester.\n\n“No. This is jest out of your reach,” said the old lady. “I want----I\nwant to see Doctor Carey bad.”\n\n“Are you strong enough to ride in or shall I bring him?”\n\n“I can go! I can go as well as not, David, if you'll take me.”\n\n“Let me run Betsy to the barn and get the Girl's phaeton. The wagon is\ntoo rough for you. Are the pains in your chest dreadful?”\n\n“I don't know how to describe them,” said Granny with perfect truth.\n\nThe Harvester leaped into the wagon and caught up the lines. As he\ndisappeared around the curve of the driveway Granny snatched the letters\nfrom her dress front and thrust them deep into one of her stockings.\n\n“Now, drat you!” she cried. “Stick out all you please. Nobody will see\nyou there.”\n\nIn a few minutes the Harvester helped her into the carriage and drove\nrapidly toward the city.\n\n“You needn't strain your critter,” said Granny. “It's not so bad as\nthat, David.”\n\n“Is your chest any better?”\n\n“A sight better,” said Granny. “Shakin' up a little 'pears to do me\ngood.”\n\n“You never should have tried to walk. Suppose I hadn't been here. And\nyou came the long way, too! I'll have a telephone run to your house so\nyou can call me after this.”\n\nGranny sat very straight suddenly.\n\n“My! wouldn't that get away with some of my foxy neighbours,” she said.\n“Me to have a 'phone like they do, an' be conversin' at all hours of the\nday with my son's folks and everybody. I'd be tickled to pieces, David.”\n\n“Then I'll never dare do it,” said the Harvester, “because I can't keep\nhouse without you.”\n\n“Where's your own woman?” promptly inquired Granny.\n\n“She can't leave her people. Her grandmother is sick.”\n\n“Grandmother your foot!” cried the old woman. “I've been hearing that\nsong and dance from the neighbours, but you got to fool younger people\nthan me on it, David. When did any grandmother ever part a pair of\nyoungsters jest married, for months at a clip? I'd like to cast my eyes\non that grandmother. She's a new breed! I was as good a mother as 'twas\nin my skin to be, and I'd like to see a child of mine do it for me;\nand as for my grandchildren, it hustles some of them to re-cog-nize me\npassing on the big road, 'specially if it's Peter's girl with a town\nbeau.”\n\nThe Harvester laughed. The old lady leaned toward him with a mist in her\neyes and a quaver in her voice, and asked softly, “Got ary friend that\ncould help you, David?”\n\nThe man looked straight ahead in silence.\n\n“Bamfoozle all the rest of them as much as you please, lad, but I stand\nto you in the place of your ma, and so I ast you plainly----got ary\nfriend that could help?”\n\n“I can think of no way in which any one possibly could help me, dear,”\n said the Harvester gently. “It is a matter I can't explain, but I know\nof nothing that any one could do.”\n\n“You mean you're tight-mouthed! You COULD tell me just like you would\nyour ma, if she was up and comin'; but you can't quite put me in her\nplace, and spit it out plain. Now mebby I can help you! Is it her fault\nor yourn?”\n\n“Mine! Mine entirely!”\n\n“Hum! What a fool question! I might a knowed it! I never saw a lovinger,\nsweeter girl in these parts. I jest worship the ground she treads on;\nand you, lad you hain't had a heart in your body sence first you saw her\nface. If I had the stren'th, I'd haul you out of this keeridge and I'd\nhammer you meller, David Langston. What in the name of sense have you\ngone and done to the purty, lovin' child?”\n\nThe Harvester's face flushed, but a line around his mouth whitened.\n\n“Loosen up!” commanded Granny. “I got some rights in this case that\nmebby you don't remember. You asked me to help you get ready for her,\nand I done what you wanted. You invited me to visit her, and I jest\nloved her sweet, purty ways. You wanted me to shet up my house and come\nover for weeks to help take keer of her, and I done it gladly, for her\npain and your sufferin' cut me as if 'twas my livin' flesh and blood;\nso you can't shet me out now. I'm in with you and her to the end. What a\nblame fool thing have you gone and done to drive away for months a girl\nthat fair worshipped you?”\n\n“That's exactly the trouble, Granny,” said the Harvester. “She didn't!\nShe merely respected and was grateful to me, and she loved me as a\nfriend; but I never was any nearer her husband than I am yours.”\n\n“I've always knowed they was a screw loose somewhere,” commented Granny.\n“And so you've sent her off to her worldly folks in a big, wicked city\nto get weaned away from you complete?”\n\n“I sent her to let her see if absence would teach her anything. I had\nmonths with her here, and I lay awake at nights thinking up new plans\nto win her. I worked for her love as I never worked for bread, but I\ncouldn't make it. So I let her go to see if separation would teach her\nanything.”\n\n“Mercy me! Why you crazy critter! The child did love you! She loved you\n'nough an' plenty! She loved you faithful and true! You was jest the\nlight of her eyes. I don't see how a girl could think more of a man.\nWhat in the name of sense are you expecting months of separation to\nteach her, but to forget you, and mebby turn her to some one else?”\n\n“I hoped it would teach her what I call love, means,” explained the\nHarvester.\n\n“Why you dratted popinjay! If ever in all my born days I wanted to take\na man and jest lit'rally mop up the airth with him, it's right here and\nnow. 'Absence teach her what you call love.' Idiot! That's your job!”\n\n“But, Granny, I couldn't!”\n\n“Wouldn't, you mean, no doubt! I hain't no manner of a notion in my head\nbut that child, depending on you, and grateful as she was, and tender\nand loving, and all sech as that I hain't a doubt but she come to you\nplain and told you she loved you with all her heart. What more could you\nast?”\n\n“That she understand what love means before I can accept what she\noffers.”\n\n“You puddin' head! You blunderbuss!” cried Granny. “Understand what you\nmean by love. If you're going to bar a woman from being a wife 'til\nshe knows what you mean by love, you'll stop about nine tenths of\nthe weddings in the world, and t'other tenth will be women that no\ndecent-minded man would jine with.”\n\n“Granny, are you sure?”\n\n“Well livin' through it, and up'ard of seventy years with other women,\nort to teach me something. The Girl offered you all any man needs to ast\nor git. Her foundations was laid in faith and trust. Her affections was\ncaught by every loving, tender, thoughtful thing you did for her; and\neverybody knows you did a-plenty, David. I never see sech a master hand\nat courtin' as you be. You had her lovin' you all any good woman knows\nhow to love a man. All you needed to a-done was to take her in your\narms, and make her your wife, and she'd 'a' waked up to what you meant\nby love.”\n\n“But suppose she never awakened?”\n\n“Aw, bosh! S'pose water won't wet! S'pose fire won't burn! S'pose the\nsun won't shine! That's the law of nature, man! If you think I hain't\ngot no sense at all I jest dare you to ask Doctor Carey. 'Twouldn't take\nhim long to comb the kinks out of you.”\n\n“I don't think you have left any, Granny,” said the Harvester. “I see\nwhat you mean, and in all probability you are right, but I can't send\nfor the Girl.”\n\n“Name o' goodness why?”\n\n“Because I sent her away against her will, and now she is remaining so\nlong that there is every probability she prefers the life she is living\nand the friends she has made there, to Medicine Woods and to me. The\nonly thing I can do now is to await her decision.”\n\n“Oh, good Lord!” groaned Granny. “You make me sick enough to kill. Touch\nup your nag and hustle me to Doc. You can't get me there quick enough to\nsuit me.”\n\nAt the hospital she faced Doctor Carey. “I think likely some of my\ninnards has got to be cut out and mended,” she said. “I'll jest take a\nfew minutes of your time to examination me, and see what you can do.”\n\nIn the private office she held the letters toward the doctor. “They\nhain't no manner of sickness ailin' me, Doc. The boy out there is in\ndeep water, and I knowed how much you thought of him, and I hoped you'd\ngive me a lift. I went over to his place this mornin' to take him a pie,\nand I found his settin' room fireplace heapin' with letters he'd writ to\nRuth about things his heart was jest so bustin' full of it eased him\nto write them down, and then he hadn't the horse sense and trust in\nher jedgment to send them on to her. I picked two fats, a lean, and a\nmiddlin' for samples, and I thought I'd send them some way, and I struck\nfor home with them an' he ketched me plumb on the bridge. I had to throw\nmy pie overboard, willer plate and all, and as God is my witness, I was\nso flustered the boy had good reason to think I was sick a-plenty; and\nsoon as he noticed it, I thought of you spang off, and I knowed you'd\nknow her whereabouts, and I made him fetch me to you. On the way I jest\ndragged it from him that he'd sent her away his fool self, because she\ndidn't sense what he meant by love, and she wa'ant beholden to him same\ndegree and manner he was to her. Great day, Doc! Did you ever hear a\npiece of foolishness to come up with that? I told him to ast you! I told\nhim you'd tell him that no clean, sweet-minded girl ever had known nor\never would know what love means to a man 'til he marries her and teaches\nher. Ain't it so, Doc?”\n\n“It certainly is.”\n\n“Then will you grind it into him, clean to the marrer, and will you send\nthese letters on to Ruthie?”\n\n“Most certainly I will,” said the doctor emphatically. Granny opened the\ndoor and walked out.\n\n“I'm so relieved, David,” she said. “He thinks they won't be no manner\no' need to knife me. Likely he can fix up a few pills and send them out\nby mail so's that I'll be as good as new again. Now we must get right\nout of here and not take valuable time. What do I owe you, Doc?”\n\n“Not a cent,” said Doctor Carey. “Thank you very much for coming to me.\nYou'll soon be all right again.”\n\n“I was some worried. Much obliged I am sure. Come on!”\n\n“One minute,” said the doctor. “David, I am making up a list of friends\nto whom I am going to send programmes of the medical meeting, and I\nthought your wife might like to see you among the speakers, and your\nsubject. What is her address?”\n\nA slow red flushed the Harvester's cheeks. He opened his lips and\nhesitated. At last he said, “I think perhaps her people prefer that she\nreceive mail under her maiden name while with them. Miss Ruth Jameson,\ncare of Alexander Herron, 5770 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, will reach\nher.”\n\nThe doctor wrote the address, as if it were the most usual thing in the\nworld, and asked the Harvester if he was ready to make the trip east.\n\n“I think we had best start to-night,” he said. “We want a day to grow\naccustomed to our clothes and new surroundings before we run up squarely\nagainst serious business.”\n\n“I will be ready,” promised the Harvester.\n\nHe took Granny home, set his house in order, installed the man he was\nleaving in charge, touched a match to the heap in the fireplace, and\ndonning the new travelling suit, he went to Doctor Carey's.\n\nMrs. Carey added a few touches, warned him to remember about the forks\nand spoons, and not to forget to shave often, and saw them off. At the\nstation Carey said to him, “You know, David, we can change at Wayne and\ngo through Buffalo, or we can take the Pittsburg and go and come through\nPhiladelphia.”\n\n“I am contemplating a trip to Philadelphia,” said the Harvester, “but I\nbelieve I will not be ready for, say a month yet. I have a theory and it\ndies hard. If it does not work out the coming month, I will go, perhaps,\nbut not now. Let us see how many kinds of a fool I make of myself in New\nYork before I attempt the Quakers.”\n\nAlmost to the city, the doctor smiled at the Harvester.\n\n“David, where did you get your infernal assurance?” he asked.\n\n“In the woods,” answered the Harvester placidly. “In doing clean work.\nWith my fingers in the muck, and life literally teeming and boiling in\nsound and action, around, above, and beneath me, a right estimate of my\nplace and province in life comes naturally in daily handling stores\non which humanity depends, I go even deeper than you surgeons and\nphysicians. You are powerless unless I reinforce your work with drugs on\nwhich you can rely. I do clean, honest work. I know its proper place and\nvalue to the world. That is why I called what I have to say, 'The Man\nin the Background.' There is no reason why I should shiver and shrink\nat meeting and explaining my work to my fellows. Every man has his\nvocation, and some of you in the limelight would cut a sorry figure if\nthe man in the background should fail you at the critical moment. Don't\nworry about me, Doc. I am all serene. You won't find I possess either\nnerves or fear. 'Be sure you are right, and then go ahead,' is my law.”\n\n“Well I'll be confounded!” said the doctor.\n\nIn a large hall, peopled with thousands of medical men, the name of the\nHarvester was called the following day and his subject was announced. He\narose in his place and began to talk.\n\n“Take the platform,” came in a roar from a hundred throats.\n\nThe Harvester hesitated.\n\n“You must, David,” whispered Carey.\n\nThe Harvester made his way forward and was guided through a side door,\nand a second later calmly walked down the big stage to the front, and\nstood at ease looking over his audience, as if to gauge its size and the\npitch to which he should raise his voice. His lean frame loomed every\ninch of his six feet, his broad shoulders were square, his clean shaven\nface alert and afire. He wore a spring suit of light gray of good\nquality and cut, and he was perfect as to details.\n\n“This scarcely seems compatible with my subject,” he remarked casually.\n“I certainly appear very much in the foreground just at present, but\nperhaps that is quite as well. It may be time that I assert myself. I\ndoubt if there is a man among you who has not handled my products more\nor less; you may enjoy learning where and how they are prepared, and\nunderstanding the manner in which my work merges with yours. I think\nperhaps the first thing is to paint you as good a word picture as I can\nof my geographical location.”\n\nThen the Harvester named latitude and longitude and degrees of\ntemperature. He described the lake, the marsh, the wooded hill, the\nswale, and open sunny fields. He spoke of water, soil, shade, and\ngeographical conditions. “Here I was born,” he said, “on land owned\nby my father and grandfather before me, and previous to them, by the\nIndians. My male ancestors, so far as I can trace them, were men of\nthe woods, hunters, trappers, herb gatherers. My mother was from the\ncountry, educated for a teacher. She had the most inexorable will power\nof any woman I ever have known. From my father I inherited my love for\nmuck on my boots, resin in my nostrils, the long trail, the camp fire,\nforest sounds and silences in my soul. From my mother I learned to read\ngood books, to study subjects that puzzled me, to tell the truth, to\nkeep my soul and body clean, and to pursue with courage the thing to\nwhich I set my hand.\n\n“There was not money enough to educate me as she would; together we\nlearned to find it in the forest. In early days we sold ferns and wild\nflowers to city people, harvested the sap of the maples in spring,\nand the nut crop of the fall. Later, as we wanted more, we trapped for\nskins, and collected herbs for the drug stores. This opened to me a\nfield I was peculiarly fitted to enter. I knew woodcraft instinctively,\nI had the location of every herb, root, bark, and seed that will endure\nmy climate; I had the determination to stick to my job, the right books\nto assist me, and my mother's invincible will power to uphold me where I\nwavered.\n\n“As I look into your faces, men, I am struck with the astounding thought\nthat some woman bore the cold sweat and pain of labour to give life to\neach of you. I hope few of you prolonged that agony as I did. It was in\nthe heart of my mother to make me physically clean, and to that end she\nsent me daily into the lake, so long as it was not ice covered, and put\nme at exercises intended to bring full strength to every sinew and fibre\nof my body. It was in her heart to make me morally clean, so she took\nme to nature and drilled me in its forces and its methods of reproducing\nlife according to the law. Her work was good to a point that all men\nwill recognize. From there on, for a few years, she held me, not because\nI was man enough to stand, but because she was woman enough to support\nme. Without her no doubt I would have broken the oath I took; with her\nI won the victory and reached years of manhood and self-control as she\nwould have had me. The struggle wore her out at half a lifetime, but\nas a tribute to her memory I cannot face a body of men having your\nopportunities without telling you that what was possible to her and\nto me is possible to all mothers and men. If she is above and hears me\nperhaps it will recompense some of her shortened years if she knows I am\npleading with you, as men having the greatest influence of any living,\nto tell and to teach the young that a clean life is possible to them.\nThe next time any of you are called upon to address a body of men tell\nthem to learn for themselves and to teach their sons, and to hold them\nat the critical hour, even by sweat and blood, to a clean life; for in\nthis way only can feeble-minded homes, almshouses, and the scarlet woman\nbe abolished. In this way only can men arise to full physical and mental\nforce, and become the fathers of a race to whom the struggle for clean\nmanhood will not be the battle it is with us.\n\n“By the distorted faces, by the misshapen bodies, by marks of\ndegeneracy, recognizable to your practised eyes everywhere on the\nstreets, by the agony of the mother who bore you, and later wept over\nyou, I conjure you men to live up to your high and holy privilege, and\ntell all men that they can be clean, if they will. This in memory of the\nmother who shortened her days to make me a moral man. And if any among\nyou is the craven to plead immorality as a safeguard to health, I ask,\nwhat about the health of the women you sacrifice to shield your precious\nbodies, and I offer my own as the best possible refutation of that\ncowardly lie. I never have been ill a moment in all my life, and\nstrength never has failed me for work to which I set my hand.\n\n“The rapidly decreasing supply of drugs and the adulterated importations\nearly taught me that the day was coming when it would be an absolute\nnecessity to raise our home supplies. So, while yet in my teens, I began\ncollecting from the fields and woods for miles around such medicinal\nstuff as grew in my father's fields, marsh, and woods, and planting\nmore wherever I found anything growing naturally in its prime. I merely\nenlarged nature's beds and preserved their natural condition. As\nthe plants spread and the harvest increased, I built a dry-house on\nscientific principles, a large store-room, and later a laboratory in\nwhich I have been learning to prepare some of my crude material for the\nmarket, combining ideas of my own in remedies, and at last producing\none your president just has indicated that I come to submit to you as a\nfinal resort in certain conditions.\n\n“My operations now have spread to close six hundred acres of almost\nsolid medicinal growth, including a little lake, around the shores of\nwhich flourish a quadruple setting of water-loving herbs.”\n\nOccasionally he shifted his position or easily walked across the\nplatform and faced his audience from a different direction. His voice\nwas strong, deep, and rang clearly and earnestly. His audience sat on\nthe front edge of their chairs, and listened to something new, with\nmouths half agape. A few times Carey turned from the speaker to face\nthe audience. He agonized in his heart that it was a closed session, and\nthat his wife was not there to hear, and that the Girl was missing it.\n\nBy the bent backs and flying fingers of the reporters at their table in\nfront he could see that to-morrow the world would read the Harvester's\nspeech; and if it were true that the little mother had shortened\nher days to produce him, she had done earth a service for which many\ngenerations would call her blessed. For the doctor could look ahead,\nand he knew that this man would not escape. The call for him and his\nunimpeachable truth would come from everywhere, and his utterances would\ncarry as far as newspapers and magazines were circulated. The good he\nwould do would be past estimation.\n\nThe Harvester continued. He was describing the most delicate and\ndifficult of herbs to secure. He was telling how they could be raised,\nprepared, kept, and compounded. He was discussing diseases that did not\nreadily yield to treatment, pointing out what drugs were customarily\nemployed and offering, if any of them had such cases, and would send\nto him, to forward samples of unadulterated stuff sufficient for a test\ncomparison with what they were using. He was walking serenely and surely\ninto the heart of every man before him.\n\nJust at the point where it was the psychological time to close, he\nstopped and stood a long instant facing them, and then he asked softly,\n“Did any man among you ever see the woman to whom he had given a strong\nman's first passion of love, slowly dying before him?”\n\nOne breathless instant he waited and then continued, “Gentlemen, I\nrecently saw this in my own case. For days it was coming, so at night I\nshut myself in my laboratory, and from the very essence of the purest\nof my self-compounded drugs I distilled a stimulant into which I put a\ntouch of heart remedy, a brace for weakening nerves, a vitalization of\nsluggish blood. As I worked, I thought in that thought which embodied\nthe essence of prayer, and when my day and my hour came, and a man who\nhas been the president of your honourable body, and is known to all of\nyou, said it was death, I took this combination that I now present to\nyou, and with the help of the Almighty and a woman above the price of\nrubies, I kept breath in the girl I love, and to-day she is at full tide\nof womanhood. As a thank offering, the formula is yours. Test it as you\nwill. Use it if you find it good. Gentlemen, I thank you!”\n\nCarey sank in his chair and watched the Harvester cross the stage. As\nhe disappeared the tumult began, and it lasted until the president arose\nand brought him back to make another bow, and then they rioted until\nthey wore themselves out. In an immaculate dress suit the Harvester sat\nthat night on the right of the gray-haired president and responded to\nthe toast, “The Harvester of the Woods.” Then the reporters carried him\naway to be photographed, and to show him the gay sights of New York.\n\nIn the train the next day, steadily speeding west, he said to Doctor\nCarey: “I feel as the old woman of Mother Goose who said, 'Lawk-a-mercy\non us, can this be really I?'”\n\n“You just bet it is!” cried the doctor. “And you have cut out work for\nyourself in good shape.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that this is a beginning. You will be called upon to speak again\nand again.”\n\n“The point is, do you honestly think I helped any?”\n\n“You did inestimable good. It only can help men to hear plain truth that\nis personal experience. As for that dope of yours, it will come closer\nraising the dead than anything I ever saw. Next case I see slipping,\nafter I've done my best, I'm going to try it out for myself.”\n\n“All right! 'Phone me and I'll bring some fresh and help you.”\n\nAt Buffalo the doctor left the car and bought a paper. As he had\nexpected the portrait and speech of the Harvester were featured. The\nreporters had been gracious. They had done all that was just to a great\nevent, and allowed themselves some latitude. He immediately mailed the\npaper to the Girl, and at Cleveland bought another for himself. When\nhe showed it to the Harvester, as he glanced at it he observed, “Do I\nappear like that?” Then he went on talking with a man he had met who\ninterested him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. THE COMING OF THE BLUEBIRD\n\nThe Harvester stopped at the mail box on his way home and among the mass\nof matter it contained was something from the Girl. It was a scrap as\nlong as his least finger and three times as wide, and by the postmark\nit had lain four days in the box. On opening it, he found only her card\nwith a line written across it, but the man went up the hill and into the\ncabin as if a cyclone were driving him, for he read, “Has your bluebird\ncome?”\n\nHe threw his travelling bag on the floor, ran to the telephone, and\ncalled the station. “Take this message,” he said. “Mrs. David Langston,\ncare of Alexander Herron, 5770 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia. Found note\nafter four days' absence. Bluebird long past due. The fairies have told\nit that my fate hereafter lies in your hands.\n\n“As always. David.”\n\nThe Harvester turned from the instrument and bent to embrace Belshazzar,\nleaping in ecstasy beside him.\n\n“Understand that, Bel?” he asked. “I don't know but it means something.\nMaybe it doesn't----not a thing! And again, there is a chance----only\nthe merest possibility----that it does. We'll risk it, Bel, and to\nbegin on I have nailed it as hard as I knew how. Next, we will clean\nthe house----until it shines, and then we will fill the cupboard, and if\nanything does happen we won't be caught napping. Yes, boy, we will take\nthe chance! We can't be any worse disappointed than we have been before\nand survived it. Come along!”\n\nHe picked up the bag and arranged its contents, carefully brushed and\nfolded on his shelves and in his closet. Then he removed the travelling\nsuit, donned the old brown clothes and went to the barn to see that his\ncreatures had been cared for properly. Early the next morning he awoke\nand after feeding and breakfasting instead of going to harvest spice\nbrush and alder he stretched a line and hung the bedding from room after\nroom to air and sun. He swept, dusted, and washed windows, made beds,\nand lastly polished the floors throughout the cabin. He set everything\nin order, and as a finishing touch, filled vases, pitchers, and bowls\nwith the bloom of red bud and silky willow catkins. He searched the\nsouth bank, but there was not a violet, even in the most exposed places.\nBy night he was tired and a little of the keen edge of his ardour was\ndulled. The next day he worked scrubbing the porches, straightening\nthe lawn and hedges, even sweeping the driveway to the bridge clear\nof wind-whirled leaves and straw. He scouted around the dry-house and\nlaboratory, and spent several extra hours on the barn so that when\nevening came everything was in perfect order. Then he dressed, ate his\nsupper and drove to the city.\n\n\nHe stopped at the mail box, but there was nothing from the Girl. The\nHarvester did not know whether he was sorry or glad. A letter might have\nsaid the same thing. Nothing meant a delightful possibility, and between\nthe two he preferred the latter. He whistled and sang as he drove to\nOnabasha, and Belshazzar looked at him with mystified eyes, for this was\nnot the master he had known of late. He did not recognize the dress or\nthe manner, but his dog heart was sympathetic to the man's every mood,\nand he remembered times when a drive down the levee always had been like\nthis, for to-night the Harvester's tongue was loosened and he talked in\nthe old way.\n\n“Just four words, Bel,” he said. “And, as I remarked before, they may\nmean the most wonderful thing on earth, and possibly nothing at all.\nBut it is in the heart of man to hope, Bel, and so we are going to live\nroyally for a week or two, just on hope, old boy. If anything should\nhappen, we are ready, rooms shining, beds fresh, fireplaces filled and\nwaiting a match, ice chest cool, and when we get back it will be stored.\nAlso a secret, Bel; we are going to a florist and a fruit store. While\nwe are at it, we will do the thing right; but we will stay away from\nDoc, until we are sure of something. He means well, but we don't like\nto be pitied, do we, Bel? Our friends don't manage their eyes and voices\nvery well these days. Never mind! Our time will come yet. The bluebird\nwill not fail us, but never before has it been so late.”\n\nOn his return he filled the pantry shelves with packages, stored the\nice chest, and set a basket of delicious fruit on the dining table. Two\nboxes remained. He opened the larger one and took from it an arm load of\nwhite lilies that he carried up the hill and divided between the mounds\nunder the oak. Then he uncovered his head, and standing at the foot of\nthem he looked among the boughs of the big tree and listened intently.\nAfter a time a soft, warm wind, catkin-scented, crept from the lake,\nand began a murmur among the clusters of brown leaves clinging to the\nbranches.\n\n“Mother,” said the Harvester, “were you with me? Did I do it right? Did\nI tell them what you would have had me say for the boys? Are you glad\nnow you held me to the narrow way? Do you want me to go before men if\nI am asked, as Doc says I will be, and tell them that the only way to\nabolish pain is for them to begin at the foundation by living clean\nlives? I don't know if I did any good, but they listened to me. Anyway,\nI did the best I knew. But that isn't strange; you ground it into me to\ndo that every day, until it is almost an instinct. Mother, dear, can you\ntell me about the bluebird? Is that softest little rustle of all your\nvoice? and does it say 'hope'? I think so, and I thank you for the\nword.”\n\nThe man's eyes dropped to earth.\n\n“And you other mother,” he said, “have you any message for me? Up where\nyou are can you sweep the world with understanding eyes and tell me why\nmy bluebird does not come? Does it know that this year your child and\nnot chance must settle my fate? Can you look across space and see if she\nis even thinking of me? But I know that! She had to be thinking of me\nwhen she wrote that line. Rather can you tell me----will she come? Do\nyou think I am man enough to be trusted with her future, if she does?\nOne thing I promise you: if such joy ever comes to me, I will know how\nto meet it gently, thankfully, tenderly, please God. Good night, little\nwomen. I hope you are sleeping well----”\n\nHe turned and went down the hill, entered the cabin and took from the\nother box a mass of Parma violets. He put these in the pink bowl and\nplaced it on the table beside the Girl's bed. He stood for a time, and\nthen began pulling single flowers from the bowl and dropping them over\nthe pillow and snowy spread.\n\n“God, how I love her!” he whispered softly.\n\nAt last he went out and closed the door. He was tired and soon fell\nasleep with the night breeze stirring his hair, and the glamour of\nmoonlight flooding the lake touched his face. Clearly it etched the\nstrong, manly features, the fine brow and chin, and painted in unusual\ntenderness the soft lines around the mouth. The little owl wavered its\nlove story, a few frogs were piping, and the Harvester lay breathing the\nperfumed spring air deeply and evenly. Near midnight Belshazzar awakened\nhim by arising from the bedside and walking to the door.\n\n“What is it, Bel?” inquired the Harvester.\n\nThe dog whined softly. The man turned his head toward the lake. A ray of\nred light touched the opposite embankment and came wavering across the\nsurface. The Harvester sat up. Two big, flaming eyes were creeping up\nthe levee.\n\n“That,” said the Harvester, “might be Doc coming for me to help him try\nout my bottled sunshine, or it might be my bluebird.”\n\nHe tossed back the cover, swung his feet to the floor, setting each in a\nslipper beside the bed, and arose, dressing as he started for the door.\nAs he opened the screen and stepped on the veranda a passenger car from\nthe city stopped, and the Harvester went down the walk to meet it. His\nheart turned over when he saw a woman's hand on the door.\n\n“Permit me,” he said, taking the handle and bringing it back with a\nsweep. A tall form arose, bent forward, and descended to the step. The\nfull flare of moonlight fell on the glowing face of the Girl.\n\n“Harvester, is it you?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” gasped the man.\n\nTwo hands came fluttering out, and he just had presence of mind to step\nin range so that they rested on his shoulders.\n\n“Has the bluebird come?”\n\n“Not yet!”\n\n“Then I am not too late?”\n\n“Never too late to come to me, Ruth.”\n\n“I am welcome?”\n\n“I have no words to tell you how welcome.”\n\nShe swayed forward and the Harvester tried to reach her lips, but they\nbrushed his cheek and touched his ear.\n\n“I have brought one more kiss I want to try,” she whispered.\n\nThe Harvester crushed her in his arms until he frightened himself for\nfear he had hurt her, and murmured an ecstasy of indistinct love words\nto her. Presently her feet touched the ground and she drew away from\nhim.\n\n“Harvester,” she whispered, “I couldn't wait any longer; indeed I could\nnot: and I couldn't leave grandfather and grandmother, and I didn't\nknow what in the world to do, so I just brought them along. Are they\nwelcome?”\n\n“Aside from you, I would rather have them than any people on earth,”\n said the Harvester.\n\nThere were two sounds in the car; one was an approving murmur, and the\nother an undeniable snort. The Harvester felt the reassuring pressure of\nthe Girl's hand.\n\n“Please, Ruth,” he said, “go turn on the light so that I can see to help\ngrandmother.”\n\nA foot stamped before the front seat. “Madam Herron, if you please!”\n cried an acrid voice.\n\n“'Madam Herron,'” said the Harvester gently, as he set a foot on the\nstep, reached in and bodily picked up a little old lady and started up\nthe walk with her in his arms.\n\n“Careful there, sir!” roared a voice after him.\n\nThe Harvester could feel the quake of the laughing woman and he smiled\nbroadly as he entered the cabin, and placed her in a large chair before\nthe fire. Then he wheeled and ran back to the car, reaching it as the\nman was making an effort to descend. It could be seen that he had been\ntall, before time and sorrow had bent him, and keen eyes gleamed below\nshaggy white brows from under his hat brim. He had a white moustache,\nand his hair was snowy.\n\n“Allow me,” said the Harvester reaching a hand.\n\n“If you touch me I will cane you,” said Mr. Alexander Herron.\n\nThere was nothing to do but step back. The cane, wheel, and a long coat\nskirt interfering, the old man fell headlong, and only quick hands saved\nhim a severe jolt and bruises. He stood glaring in the moonlight while\nhis hat was restored.\n\n“If you run your car to the curve you can back toward the south and turn\neasily,” said the Harvester to the driver. As the automobile passed them\nhe offered his arm. “May I show you to the fire? These spring nights are\nchilly.”\n\n“'Chilly!' Demnition cold is what they are! I'm frozen to the bone! This\nwill be the end of us both! Dragging people of our age around at this\nhour of night. Of all the accursed stubbornness!”\n\n“There are three low steps,” said the Harvester, “now a straight stretch\nof walk, now two steps; there you are on the level. Here is an easy\nchair. It would be better to leave on your coat, until I light the\nfire.”\n\nHe knelt and scratched a match, and almost instantly a flame sprang from\nthe heap of dry kindling, and began to wrap around the big logs.\n\n“How pretty!” exclaimed a soft voice.\n\n“Kind of a hunting lodge in the wilds, is it?” growled a rough one.\n“Marcella, you will take your death here!”\n\n“I'm sure I feel no exposure. Really, Alexander, if I had passed away\nevery time you have prophesied that I would in the past twenty years\nyou'd have the largest private cemetery in existence. If you would not\nbe so pessimistic I could quite enjoy the trip. It's so long since I've\nridden in the cars.”\n\n“Of all the abandoned places! And for you to be here, after your years\nin bed!”\n\n“But I'm not nearly so tired as I am at home, Alexander, truly.”\n\n“Let me help you, grandfather,” offered the Girl.\n\nShe went to him and took his hat and stick.\n\n“Leave me my cane,” he cried. “Any instant that beast may attack some of\nus.”\n\nThe Girl laughed merrily.\n\n“Why grandfather!” she chided, “Bel is the finest dog you ever knew,\nhe is my best friend here. By the hour he has protected me, and he is\ngentle as a kitten. He's crazy over my coming home.”\n\nShe knelt on the floor, put her arms around the dog's neck, and the\ndelighted brute quivered with the joy of her caress and the sound of her\nloved voice.\n\n“Ruthie!” cautioned the gentle lady.\n\n“Put that cur out of doors, where animals belong,” roared the old man,\nlifting his stick.\n\n“Careful!” warned the grave voice of the Harvester.\n\n“I thought you said he was gentle as a kitten!”\n\n“Grandfather, I said that,” cried the Girl.\n\n“Well wasn't it the truth?”\n\n“You can see how he loves me. Didn't I ever tell you that Bel made the\nfirst friendly overture I ever received in this part of the country?\nHe's watched me by the day, even while I slept.”\n\n“Then what's all this infernal fuss about?”\n\n“Try striking him if you want to find out,” explained the Harvester\ngently. “You see, Belshazzar and I are accustomed to living here alone\nand very quietly. He is excited over the Girl's return, because she is\nhis friend, and he has not forgotten her. Then this is the first time in\nhis life he ever heard an irritable voice from a visitor or saw a cane,\nand it angers him. He is perfectly safe to guard a baby, if he is gently\ntreated, but he is a sure throat hold to a stranger who bespeaks him\nroughly or attempts to strike. He would be of no use as a guard to\nvaluable property while I sleep if he were otherwise. Bel, come here!\nLie still.”\n\nThe dog sank to the floor beside the Harvester, but his sharp eyes\nfollowed the Girl, and the hair arose on his neck at every rasping note\nof the old man's voice.\n\n“I wouldn't give such a creature house room for a minute,” insisted the\nguest.\n\n“Wait until you see him work and become acquainted with him, and you\nwill change that verdict,” prophesied the Harvester.\n\n“I never was known to change an opinion. Never, sir! Never!” cried the\ntesty voice.\n\n“How unfortunate!” remarked the Harvester suavely.\n\n“Explain yourself! Explain yourself, sir!”\n\n“There never has been, there never will be, a man on this earth,” said\nthe Harvester, “wholly free from mistakes. Are you warm now?” He turned\nto the little lady, cutting off a reply with his question.\n\n“Nice and warm and quite sleepy,” she said.\n\n“What may I bring you for a light lunch before you go to bed?”\n\n“Oh, could I have a bite of something?”\n\n“If only I am fortunate enough to have anything you will care for. What\nabout a bowl of hot milk and a slice of toast?”\n\n“Why I think that would be just the thing!”\n\n“Excuse me,” said the Harvester rising.\n\nHe went to the kitchen and they could hear him moving around.\n\n“I wish the big brute would take his beast along,” growled Mr. Alexander\nHerron.\n\n“Come, Bel,” ordered the Girl. “Let's go to the kitchen.”\n\nThe dog instantly arose and followed her.\n\n“What can I do to help?” she asked as they reached the door.\n\n“Remain where you won't dazzle my eyes,” said the Harvester, “until I\nhelp the gentle lady and the gentle man to bed.”\n\nPresently he came with a white cloth, two spoons, and a plate of bread.\nHe spread the cloth on the table, laid the spoons on it, and opening the\nlittle cupboard, took out a long toasting fork, and sticking it into a\nslice of bread, he held it over the coals. When it grew golden brown he\nlifted the table beside the chair, and brought a bowl of scalded milk.\n\n“Marcella, that stuff will be too smoky for you! Your stomach will rebel\nat it.”\n\n“Grandfather, there will not be a suspicion of odour,” said the Girl. “I\nhave had it that way often.”\n\n“Then no wonder you came from this place looking like a picked crane, if\nthat is a sample of what you were fed on!”\n\nThe face of the Harvester grew redder than the heat of the fire\nnecessitated, but at the ringing laugh of the Girl he set his teeth\nand went on toasting bread. Grandmother crumbled some in the milk and\npicking up the spoon tested the combination. She was very hungry, and it\nwas good. She began eating with relish.\n\n“Alexander, you will be the loser if you don't have some of this,” she\nsaid. “It's just delicious!”\n\n“Maybe smoked spoon victuals are proper for invalid women,” he retorted,\n“but they are mighty thin diet for a hardy man.”\n\n“What about a couple of eggs and some beef extract?” suggested the cook.\n\n“Sounds more sensible by a long shot.”\n\n“Ruth, you make this toast,” said the Harvester and disappeared.\n\nPresently he placed before his guest a couple of eggs poached in milk,\na steaming bowl of beef juice, and a plate of toast. For one instant\nthe Harvester thought this was going into the fire, the next a slice was\npicked up and smelled testily. The Girl sat on her grandfather's chair\narm, and breaking a morsel of toast dipped it into the broth and tasted\nit.\n\n“Oh but that is good!” she cried. “Why haven't I some also? Am I\nsupposed to have no 'tummy'?”\n\n“Your turn next,” said the Harvester, as he again gave her the fork and\nwent to the kitchen.\n\nWhen he returned and served the Girl he found her grandfather eating\nheartily.\n\n“Why I think this is fun,” said the gentle lady. “I haven't had such a\nfine time in ages. I love the heat of the flame on my body and things\ntaste so good. I could go to sleep without any narcotic, right now.”\n\nClose her knee the Harvester knelt on the hearth with his toasting fork.\nShe leaned forward and ran her fingers through his hair.\n\n“You're a braw laddie,” she said. “Now I see why Ruthie WOULD come.”\n\nThe Harvester took the frail hand and kissed it. “Thank you!” he\nreturned.\n\n“Mush!” exploded the grizzled man in the rear.\n\nWhen no one wanted more food the Harvester stacked and carried away the\ndishes, swept the hearth, and replaced the toaster.\n\n“Ruth and I often lunched this way last fall,” he said. “We liked it for\na change.”\n\n“Alexander, have you noticed?” asked the little woman as she lifted wet\neyes to a beautiful portrait of her daughter beside the chimney.\n\n“D'ye think I'm blind? Saw it as I entered the door. Poor taste! Very!\nBrown may match the rug and wood-work, but it's a wretched colour for a\nyoung girl in her gay time. Should be pink and white with a gold frame.”\n\n“That would be beautiful,” agreed the Harvester. “We must have one that\nway. This is not an expensive picture. It is only an enlargement from an\nold photograph.”\n\n“We have a number of very handsome likenesses. Which one can you spare\nRuth, Marcella?”\n\n“The one she likes best,” said the lady promptly.\n\n“And the other is your mother, no doubt. What a girlish, beautiful\nface!”\n\n“Wonderfully fine!” growled a gruff old voice tinctured with tears, and\nthe Harvester began to see light.\n\nThe old man arose. “Ruthie, help your grandmother to bed,” he said. “And\nyou, sir, have the goodness to walk a few steps with me.”\n\nThe Harvester sprang up and brought Mr. Herron his coat and hat and held\nthe door. The Girl brushed past him.\n\n“To the oak,” she whispered.\n\nThey went into the night, and without a word the Harvester took his\nguest's arm and guided him up the hill. When they reached the two mounds\nthe moon shining between the branches touched the lily faces with with\nholy whiteness.\n\n“She sleeps there,” said the Harvester, indicating the place.\n\nThen he turned and went down the path a little distance and waited until\nhe feared the night air would chill the broken old man.\n\n“You can see better to-morrow,” he said as he touched the shaking figure\nand assisted it to arise.\n\n“Your work?” Mr. Alexander Herron touched the lilies with his walking\nstick.\n\nThe Harvester assented.\n\n“Do you mind if I carry one to Marcella?”\n\nThe Harvester trembled as he stooped to select the largest and whitest,\nand with sudden illumination, he fully understood. He helped the\ntottering old man to the cabin, where he sat silently before the\nfireplace softly touching the lily face with his lips.\n\n“I have put grandmother in my bed, tucked her in warmly, and she says it\nis soft and fine,” laughed the Girl, coming to them. “Now you go before\nshe falls asleep, and I hope you will rest well.”\n\nShe bent and kissed him.\n\nThe Harvester held the door.\n\n“Can I be of any service?” he inquired.\n\n“No, I'm no helpless child.”\n\n“Then to my best wishes for sound sleep the remainder of the night, I\nwill add this,” said the Harvester----“You may rest in peace concerning\nyour dear girl. I sympathize with your anxiety. Good night!”\n\nAlexander Herron threw out his hands in protest.\n\n“I wouldn't mind admitting that you are a gentleman in a month or two,”\n he said, “but it's a demnation humiliation to have it literally wrung\nfrom me to-night!”\n\nHe banged the door in the face of the amazed Harvester, who turned\nto the Girl as she leaned against the mantel. He stood absorbing the\nglowing picture of beauty and health that she made. She had removed her\ntravelling dress and shoes, and was draped in a fleecy white wool kimono\nand wearing night slippers. Her hair hung in two big braids as it had\nduring her illness. She was his sick girl again in costume, but radiant\nhealth glowed on her lovely face. The Harvester touched a match to a few\ncandles and turned out the acetylene lights. Then he stood before her.\n\n“Now, bluebird,” he said gently. “Ruth, you always know where to find\nme, if you will look at your feet. I thought I loved you all in my power\nwhen you went, but absence has taught its lessons. One is that I can\ngrow to love you more every day I live, and the other that I probably\ntrifled with the highest gift you had to offer, when I sent you away.\nI may have been right; Granny and Doc think I was wrong. You know the\nanswer. You said there was another kiss for me. Ruth, is it the same or\na different one?”\n\n“It is different. Quite, quite different!”\n\n“And when?” The Harvester stretched out longing arms. The Girl stepped\nback.\n\n“I don't know,” she said. “I had it when I started, but I lost it on the\nway.”\n\nThe Harvester staggered under the disappointment.\n\n“Ruth, this has gone far enough that you wouldn't play with me, merely\nfor the sake of seeing me suffer, would you?”\n\n“No!” cried the Girl. “No! I mean it! I knew just what I wanted to say\nwhen I started; but we had to take grandmother out of bed. She wouldn't\nallow me to leave her, and I wouldn't stay away from you any longer. She\nfainted when we put her on the car and grandfather went wild. He almost\nkilled the porters, and he raved at me. He said my mother had ruined\ntheir lives, and now I would be their death. I got so frightened I had a\nnervous chill and I'm so afraid she will grow worse----”\n\n“You poor child!” shuddered the Harvester. “I see! I understand! What\nyou need is quiet and a good rest.”\n\nHe placed her in a big easy chair and sitting on the hearth rug he\nleaned against her knee and said, “Now tell me, unless you are so tired\nthat you should go to bed.”\n\n“I couldn't possibly sleep until I have told you,” said the Girl.\n\n“If you're merciful, cut it short!” implored the Harvester.\n\n“I think it begins,” she said slowly, “when I went because you sent me\nand I didn't want to go. Of course, as soon as I saw grandfather and\ngrandmother, heard them talk, and understood what their lives had been,\nand what might have been, why there was only one thing to do, as I could\nsee it, and that was to compensate their agony the best I could. I think\nI have, David. I really think I have made them almost happy. But I told\nthem all any one could tell about you in the start, and from the first\ngrandmother would have been on your side; but you see how grandfather\nis, and he was absolutely determined that I should live with them, in\ntheir home, all their lives. He thought the best way to accomplish that\nwould be to separate me from you and marry me to the son of his partner.\n\n“There are rooms packed with the lovely things they bought me, David,\nand everything was as I wrote you. Some of the people who came were\nwonderful, so gracious and beautiful, I loved almost all of them. They\ntook me places where there were pictures, plays, and lovely parties, and\nI studied hard to learn some music, to dance, ride and all the things\nthey wanted me to do, and to read good books, and to learn to meet\npeople with graciousness to equal theirs, and all of it. Every day I\ngrew stronger and met more people, and there were different places to\ngo, and always, when anything was to be done, up popped Mr. Herbert\nKennedy and said and did exactly the right thing, and he could be\nextremely nice, David.”\n\n“I haven't a doubt!” said the Harvester, laying hold of her kimono.\n\n“And he popped up so much that at last I saw he was either pretending\nor else he really was growing very fond of me, so one day when we were\nalone I told him all about you, to make him see that he must not. He\nlaughed at me, and said exactly what you did, that I didn't love you\nat all, that it was gratitude, that it was the affection of a child. He\ntalked for hours about how grandfather and grandmother had suffered,\nhow it was my duty to live with them and give you up, even if I cared\ngreatly for you; but he said what I felt was not love at all. Then he\ntried to tell me what he thought love was, and I could see very clearly\nthat if it was like that, I didn't love you, but I came a whole world\ncloser it than loving him, and I told him so. He laughed again and said\nI was mistaken, and that he was going to teach me what real love was,\nand then I could not be driven back to you. After that, everybody and\neverything just pushed me toward him with both hands, except one person.\nShe was a young married woman and I met her at the very first. She\nwas the only real friend I ever had, and at last, the latter part of\nFebruary, when things were the very worst, I told her. I told her every\nsingle thing. She was on your side. She said you were twice the man\nHerbert Kennedy was, and as soon as I found I could talk to her about\nyou, I began going there and staying as long as I could, just to talk\nand to play with her baby.\n\n“Her husband was a splendid young fellow, and I grew very fond of him.\nI knew she had told him, because he suddenly began talking to me in the\nkindest way, and everything he said seemed to be what I most wanted to\nhear. I got along fairly well until hints of spring began to come, and\nthen I would wonder about my hedge, and my gold garden, and if the ice\nwas off the lake, and about my boat and horse, and I wanted my room,\nand oh, David, most of all I wanted you! Just you! Not because you\ncould give me anything to compare in richness with what they could, not\nbecause this home was the best I'd ever known except theirs, not for any\nreason at all only just that I wanted to see your face, hear your voice,\nand have you pick me up and take me in your arms when I was tired. That\nwas when I almost quit writing. I couldn't say what I wanted to, and I\nwouldn't write trivial things, so I went on day after day just groping.”\n\n“And you killed me alive,” said the Harvester.\n\n“I was afraid of that, but I couldn't write. I just couldn't! It was ten\ndays ago that I thought of the bluebird's coming this year and what it\nwould mean to you, and THAT killed me, Man! It just hurt my heart\nuntil it ached, to know that you were out here alone; and that night I\ncouldn't sleep, because I was thinking of you, and it came to me that if\nI had your lips then I could give you a much, much better kiss than the\nlast, and when it was light I wrote that line.\n\n“Nearly a week later I got your answer early in the morning, and it\nalmost drove me wild. I took it and went for the day with May, and I\ntold her. She took me upstairs, and we talked it over, and before I left\nshe made me promise that I would write you and explain how I felt, and\nask you what you thought. She wanted you to come there and see if you\ncouldn't make them at least respect you. I know I was crying, and she\nwas bathing the baby. She went to bring something she had forgotten, and\nshe gave him to me to hold, just his little naked body. He stood on my\nlap and mauled my face, and pulled my hair, and hugged me with his stout\nlittle arms and kissed me big, soft, wet kisses, and something sprang to\nlife in my heart that never before had been there. I just cried all over\nhim and held him fast, and I couldn't give him up when she came back. I\nsaw why I'd wanted a big doll all my life, right then; and oh, dear!\nthe doll you sent was beautiful, but, David, did you ever hold a little,\nliving child in your arms like that?”\n\n“I never did,” said the Harvester huskily.\n\nHe looked at her face and saw the tears rolling, but he could say no\nmore, so he leaned his head against her knee, and finding one of her\nhands he drew it to his lips.\n\n“It is wonderful,” said the Girl softly. “It awakens something in\nyour heart that makes it all soft and tender, and you feel an awful\nresponsibility, too. Grandmother had them telephone at last, and May\nhelped me bathe my face and fix my hat. When we went to the carriage Mr.\nKennedy was there to take me home. We went past grandmother's florist to\nget her some violets----David, she is sleeping under yours, with just a\nfew touching her lips. Oh it was lovely of you to get them; your fairies\nmust have told you! She has them every day, and one of the objections\nshe made to coming here was that she couldn't do without them in winter,\nand she found some on her pillow the very first thing. David, you are\nwonderful! And grandfather with his lily! I know where he found that! I\nknew instantly. Ah, there are fairies who tell you, because you deserve\nto know.”\n\nThe Girl bent and slipping her arm around his neck hugged him tight\nan instant, and then she continued unsteadily: “While he was in the\nshop----Harvester, this is like your wildest dream, but it's truest\ntruth----a boy came down the walk crying papers, and as I live, he\ncalled your name. I knew it had to be you because he said, 'First drug\nfarm in America! Wonderful medicine contributed to the cause of science!\nDavid Langston honoured by National Medical Association!' I just stood\nin the carriage and screamed, 'Boy! Boy!' until the coachman thought I\nhad lost my senses. He whistled and got me the paper. I was shaking so\nI asked him how to find anything you wanted quickly, and he pointed the\ncolumn where events are listed; and when I found the third page there\nwas your face so splendidly reproduced, and you seemed so fine and noble\nto me I forgot about the dress suit and the badge in your buttonhole,\nor to wonder when or how or why it could have happened. I just sat there\nshouting in my soul, 'David! David! Medicine Man! Harvester Man!' again\nand again.”\n\n“I don't know what I said to Mr. Kennedy or how I got to my room. I\nscanned it by the column, at last I got to paragraphs, and finally I\nread all the sentences. David, I kissed that newspaper face a hundred\ntimes, and if you could have had those, Man, I think you would have said\nthey were right. David, there is nothing to cry over!”\n\n“I'm not!” said the Harvester, wiping the splashes from her hand. “But,\nRuth, forget what I said about being brief. I didn't realize what was\ncoming. I should have said, if you've any mercy at all, go slowly! This\nis the greatest thing that ever happened or ever will happen to me. See\nthat you don't leave out one word of it.”\n\n“I told you I had to tell you first,” said the Girl.\n\n“I understand now,” said the Harvester, his head against her knee while\nhe pressed her hand to his lips. “I see! Your coming couldn't be perfect\nwithout knowing this first. Go on, dear heart, and slowly! You owe me\nevery word.”\n\n“When I had it all absorbed, I carried the paper to the library and\nsaid, 'Grandfather, such a wonderful thing has happened. A man has had a\nnew idea, and he has done a unique work that the whole world is going\nto recognize. He has stood before men and made a speech that few, oh\nso few, could make honestly, and he has advocated right living, oh\nso nobly, and he has given a wonderful gift to science without price,\nbecause through it he first saved the life he loved best. Isn't that\nmarvellous, grandfather?' And he said, 'Very marvellous, Ruth. Won't\nyou sit down and read to me about it?' And I said, 'I can't, dear\ngrandfather, because I have been away from grandmother all day, and\nshe is fretting for me, and to-night is a great ball, and she has spent\nmillions on my dress, I think, and there is an especial reason why I\nmust go, and so I have to see her now; but I want to show you the man's\nface, and then you can read the story.'\n\n“You see, I knew if I started to read it he would stop me; but if I left\nhim alone with it he would be so curious he would finish. So I turned\nyour name under and held the paper and said, 'What do you think of that\nface, grandfather? Study it carefully,' and, Man, only guess what he\nsaid! He said, 'I think it is the face of one of nature's noblemen.' I\njust kissed him time and again and then I said, 'So it is grandfather,\nso it is; for it is the face of the man who twice saved my life, and\nlifted my mother from almost a pauper grave and laid her to rest\nin state, and the man who found you, and sent me to you when I was\ndetermined not to come.' And I just stood and kissed that paper before\nhim and cried, again and again, 'He is one of nature's noblemen, and he\nis my husband, my dear, dear husband and to-morrow I am going home\nto him.' Then I laid the paper on his lap and ran away. I went to\ngrandmother and did everything she wanted, then I dressed for the ball.\nI went to say good-bye to her and show my dress and grandfather was\nthere, and he followed me out and said, 'Ruth, you didn't mean it?' I\nsaid, 'Did you read the paper, grandfather?' and he said 'Yes'; and I\nsaid, 'Then I should think you would know I mean it, and glory in my\nwonderful luck. Think of a man like that, grandfather!'\n\n“I went to the ball, and I danced and had a lovely time with every one,\nbecause I knew it was going to be the very last, and to-morrow I must\nstart to you.\n\n“On the way home I told Mr. Kennedy what paper to get and to read it. I\nsaid good-bye to him, and I really think he cared, but I was too happy\nto be very sorry. When I reached my room there was a packet for me and,\nMan, like David of old, you are a wonderful poet! Oh Harvester! why\ndidn't you send them to me instead of the cold, hard things you wrote?”\n\n“What do you mean, Ruth?”\n\n“Those letters! Those wonderful outpourings of love and passion and\npoetry and song and broken-heartedness. Oh Man, how could you write such\nthings and throw them in the fire? Granny Moreland found them when she\ncame to bring you a pie, and she carried them to Doctor Carey, and he\nsent them to me, and, David, they finished me. Everything came in a\nheap. I would have come without them, but never, never with quite the\nunderstanding, for as I read them the deeps opened up, and the flood\nbroke, and there did a warm tide go through all my being, like you said\nit would; and now, David, I know what you mean by love. I called\nthe maids and they packed my trunk and grandmother's, and I had\ngrandfather's valet pack his, and go and secure berths and tickets, and\nlearn about trains, and I got everything ready, even to the ambulance\nand doctor; but I waited until morning to tell them. I knew they would\nnot let me come alone, so I brought them along. David, what in the world\nare we going to do with them?”\n\nThe Harvester drew a deep breath and looked at the flushed face of the\nGirl.\n\n“With no time to mature a plan, I would say that we are going to love\nthem, care for them, gradually teach them our work, and interest them in\nour plans here; and so soon as they become reconciled we will build them\nsuch a house as they want on the hill facing us, just across Singing\nWater, and there they may have every luxury they can provide for\nthemselves, or we can offer, and the pleasure of your presence, and both\nof them can grow strong and happy. I'll have grandmother on her feet in\nten days, and the edge off grandfather's tongue in three. That bluster\nof his is to drown tears, Ruth; I saw it to-night. And when they pass\nover we will carry them up and lay them beside her under the oak, and\nwe can take the house we build for them, if you like it better, and use\nthis for a store-room.”\n\n“Never!” said the Girl. “Never! My sunshine room and gold garden so long\nas I live. Never again will I leave them. If this cabin grows too small,\nwe will build all over the hillside; but my room and garden and this and\nthe dining-room and your den there must remain as they are now.”\n\nThe Harvester arose and drew the davenport before the fireplace, and\nheaped pillows. “You are so tired you are trembling, and your voice is\nquivering,” he said. He lifted the Girl, laid her down and arranged the\ncoverlet.\n\n“Go to sleep!” he ordered gently. “You have made me so wildly happy that\nI could run and shout like a madman. Try to rest, and maybe the fairies\nwho aid me will put my kiss back on your lips. I am going to the hill\ntop to tell mother and my God.”\n\nHe knelt and gathered her in his arms a second, then called Belshazzar\nto guard, and went into the sweet spring night, to jubilate with that\nwild surge of passion that sweeps the heart of a strong man when he is\nmost nearly primal. He climbed the hill at a rush, and standing beneath\nthe oak on the summit, he faced the lake, and stretching his arms\nwidely, he waved them, merely to satisfy the demand for action. When\nurgency for expression came upon him, he laughed a deep rumble of\nexultation.\n\nThe night wind swept the lake and lifted his hair, the odour of spring\nwas intoxicating in his nostrils, small creatures of earth stirred\naround him, here and there a bird, restless in the delirium of mating\nfever, lifted its head and piped a few notes on the moon-whitened air.\nThe frogs sang uninterruptedly at the water's edge. The Harvester stood\nrejoicing. Beating on his brain came a rush of love words uttered in the\nGirl's dear voice. “I wanted you! Just you! He is my husband! My dear,\ndear husband! To-morrow I am going home! Now, David, I know what you\nmean by love!” The Harvester laughed again and sounds around him ceased\nfor a second, then swelled in fuller volume than before. He added his\nvoice. “Thank God! Oh, thank God!” he cried. “And may the Author of the\nUniverse, the spirits of the little mothers who loved us, and all the\ngood fairies who guide us, unite to bring unbounded joy to my Dream Girl\nand to guard her safely.”\n\nThe cocks of Medicine Woods began their second salute to dawn. At this\nsound and with the mention of her name, the Harvester turned down the\nhill, and striding forcefully approached the cabin. As he passed the\nGirl's room he stepped softly, smiling as he wondered if its unexpected\noccupants were resting. He followed Singing Water, and stood looking at\nthe hillside, studying the exact location most suitable for a home for\nthe old people he was so delighted to welcome. That they would remain\nhe never doubted. His faith in the call of the wild had been verified in\nthe Girl; it would reach them also. The hill top would bind them. Their\nlove for the Girl would compel them. They would be company for her and a\nnew interest in life.\n\n“Couldn't be better, not possibly!” commented the delighted Harvester.\n\nHe followed the path down Singing Water until he reached the bridge\nwhere it turned into the marsh. There he paused, looking straight ahead.\n\n“Wonder if I would frighten her?” he mused. “I believe I'll risk it.”\n\nHe walked on rapidly, vaulted the fence enclosing his land, crossed the\nroad, and unlatched the gate. As he did so, the door opened, and Granny\nMoreland stood on the sill, waiting with keen eyes.\n\n“Well I don't need neither specs nor noonday sun to see that you're\nsteppin' like the blue ribbon colt at the County Fair, and lookin' like\nyou owned Kingdom Come,” she said. “What's up, David?”\n\n“You are right, dear,” said the Harvester. “I have entered my kingdom.\nThe Girl has come and crowned me with her love. She had decided to\nreturn, but the letters you sent made her happier about it. I wanted you\nto know.”\n\nGranny leaned against the casing, and began to sob unrestrainedly.\n\nThe Harvester supported her tenderly.\n\n“Why don't do that, dear. Don't cry,” he begged. “The Girl is home for\nalways, Granny, and I'm so happy I am out to-night trying to keep from\nlosing my mind with joy. She will come to you to-morrow, I know.”\n\nGranny tremulously dried her eyes.\n\n“What an old sap-head I am!” she commented. “I stole your letters from\nyour fireplace, pitched a willer plate into the lake----you got to fish\nthat out, come day, David----fooled you into that trip to Doc Carey to\nget him to mail them to Ruth, and never turned a hair. But after I got\nhome I commenced thinkin' 'twas a pretty ticklish job to stick your nose\ninto other people's business, an' every hour it got worse, until I ain't\nhad a fairly decent sleep since. If you hadn't come soon, boy, I'd 'a'\nbeen sick a-bed. Oh, David! Are you sure she's over there, and loves you\nto suit you now?”\n\n“Yes dear, I am absolutely certain,” said the Harvester. “She was so\ndetermined to come that she brought the invalid grandmother she couldn't\nleave and her grandfather. They arrived at midnight. We are all going to\nlive together now.”\n\n“Well bless my stars! Fetched you a family! David, I do hope to all\nthat's peaceful I hain't put my foot in it. The moon is the deceivingest\nthing on earth I know, but does her family 'pear to be an a-gre'-able\nfamily, by its light?”\n\nThe Harvester's laugh boomed a half mile down the road.\n\n“Finest people on earth, next to you, dear. I'm mighty glad to have\nthem. I'm going to build them a house on my best location, and we are\nall going to be happy from now on. Go to bed! This night air may chill\nyou. I can't sleep. I wanted you to know first----so I came over. In\nmother's stead, will you kiss me, and wish me happiness, dear friend?”\n\nGranny Moreland laid an eager, withered hand on each shoulder, and bent\nto the radiant young face.\n\n“God bless you, lad, and grant you as great happiness as life ort to\nfetch every clean, honest man,” she prayed fervently, with closed eyes\nand her lined old face turned skyward. “And, O God, bless Ruth, and help\nher as You never helped mortal woman before to know her own mind without\n'variableness, neither shadow of turnin'.'”\n\nThe Harvester was on Singing Water bridge before he gave way. There he\nlaughed as never before in his life. Finally he controlled himself\nand started toward the cabin; but he was chuckling as he passed the\ndriveway, and walked down the broad cement floor leading to his bathing\npool, where the moonlight bridged the lake, and fell as a benediction\nall around him.\n\nHe stood a long time, when he recognized the familiar crash of a\nbreaking backlog falling together, and heard the customary leap of the\nfrightened dog. He walked to his door and listened intently, but there\nwas no sound; so he decided the Girl had not been awakened. In the midst\nof a whitening sheet of gold the Harvester dropped to his stoop and\nleaned his head against the broad casing. He broke a twig from a\nhawthorn bush beside him, and sat twisting it in his fingers as\nhe stared down the line of the gold bridge. Never had it seemed so\nmaterial, so like a path that might be trodden by mortal feet and lead\nthem straight to Heaven. As on the hill top, night again surrounded him\nand the Harvester's soul drank deep wild draughts of a new joy. Sleep\nwas out of the question. He was too intensely alive to know that he ever\nagain could be weary. He sat there in the moonlight, and with unbridled\nheart gloried in the joy that had come to him.\n\nHe turned his face from the bridge as he heard the click of Belshazzar's\nnails on the floor of the bathing pool. Then his heart and breath\nstopped an instant. Beside the dog walked the Girl, one hand on his head\nthe other holding the flowing white robe around her and grasping one of\nthe Harvester's lilies. His first thought was sheer amazement that she\nwas not afraid, for it was evident now that the backlog had awakened\nher, and she had taken the dog and gone to her mother. Then she had\nfollowed the path leading down the hill, around the cabin, and into the\nsheet of moonlight gilding the shore. She stood there gazing over\nthe lake, oblivious to all things save the entrancing allurement of\na perfect spring night beside undulant water. Screened from her with\nbushes and trees the Harvester scarcely breathed lest he startle her.\nThen his head swam, and his still heart leaped wildly. She was coming\ntoward him. On her left lay the path to the hill top. A few steps\nfarther she could turn to the right and follow the driveway to the front\nof the cabin. He leaned forward watching in an agony of suspense. Her\nbeautiful face was transfigured with joy, aflame with love, radiant with\nsmiles, and her tall figure fleecy white, rimmed in gold. Up the shining\npath of light she steadily advanced toward his door. Then the Harvester\nunderstood, and from his exultant heart burst the wordless petition:\n\n“LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, HELP ME TO BE A MAN!”\n\nWith outstretched arms he arose to meet her.\n\n“My Dream Girl!” he cried hoarsely. “My Dream Girl!”\n\n“Coming, Harvester!” she answered in tones of joy, as she dropped the\nwhite flower and lifted her hands to draw his face toward her.\n\n“Is that the kiss you wanted?” she questioned.\n\n“Yes, Ruth,” breathed the Harvester.\n\n“Then I am ready to be your wife,” she said. “May I share all the\nremainder of life's joys and sorrows with you?”\n\nThe Harvester gathered her in his arms and carried her to the bench on\nthe lake shore. He wrapped the white robe around her and clasped her\ntenderly as behooved a lover, yet with arms that she knew could have\ncrushed her had they willed. The minutes slipped away, and still he held\nher to his heart, the reality far surpassing his dream; for he knew that\nhe was awake, and he realized this as the supreme hour that comes to the\nstrongman who knows his love requited.\n\nWhen the first banner of red light arose above Medicine Woods and\nSinging Water the cocks on the hillside announced the dawn. As the gold\nfaded to gray, a burst of bubbling notes swelled from a branch almost\nover their heads where stood a bark-enclosed little house.\n\n“Ruth, do you hear that?” asked the Harvester softly.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, “and I see it. A wonderful bird, with Heaven's\ndeepest blue on its back and a breast like a russet autumn leaf, came\nstraight up the lake from the south, and before it touched the limb that\nsong seemed to gush from its throat.”\n\n“And for that reason, the greatest nature lover who ever lived says\nthat it 'deserves preeminence.' It always settles from its long voyage\nthrough the air in an ecstasy of melody. Do you know what it is, Ruth?”\n\nThe Girl laid a hand on his cheek and turned his eyes from the bird to\nher face as she answered, “Yes, Harvester-man, I know. It is your first\nbluebird----but it is far too late, and Belshazzar has lost high office.\nI have usurped both their positions. You remain in the woods and reap\ntheir harvest, you enter the laboratory and make wonderful, life-giving\nmedicines, you face the world and tell men of the high and holy life\nthey may live if they will, and then----always and forever, you come\nback to Medicine Woods and to me, Harvester.”"
