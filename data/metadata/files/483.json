There was no thaw; only where\nthe line of factories followed the big bend of the frozen river, their\ndistant chimneys like exclamation points on a blank page, was there a\nfirst threat against the supreme whiteness.  The wind passed quickly\nand on high; the shouting of the school-children had ceased at nine\no'clock with pitiful suddenness; no sleigh-bells laughed out on the\nair; and the muffling of the thoroughfares wrought an unaccustomed\npeace like that of Sunday. This was the phenomenon which afforded the\nopening of the morning debate of the sages in the wide windows of the\n\"National House.\"\n\nOnly such unfortunates as have so far failed to visit Canaan do not\nknow that the \"National House\" is on the Main Street side of the\nCourt-house Square, and has the advantage of being within two minutes'\nwalk of the railroad station, which is in plain sight of the\nwindows--an inestimable benefit to the conversation of the aged men who\noccupied these windows on this white morning, even as they were wont in\nsummer to hold against all comers the cane-seated chairs on the\npavement outside.  Thence, as trains came and went, they commanded the\ncity gates, and, seeking motives and adding to the stock of history,\nnarrowly observed and examined into all who entered or departed.  Their\nhabit was not singular.  He who would foolishly tax the sages of Canaan\nwith a bucolic light-mindedness must first walk in Piccadilly in early\nJune, stroll down the Corso in Rome before Ash Wednesday, or regard\nthose windows of Fifth Avenue whose curtains are withdrawn of a winter\nSunday; for in each of these great streets, wherever the windows, not\nof trade, are widest, his eyes must behold wise men, like to those of\nCanaan, executing always their same purpose.\n\nThe difference is in favor of Canaan; the \"National House\" was the\nclub, but the perusal of traveller or passer by was here only the spume\nblown before a stately ship of thought; and you might hear the sages\ncomparing the Koran with the speeches of Robert J. Ingersoll.\n\nIn the days of board sidewalks, \"mail-time\" had meant a precise moment\nfor Canaan, and even now, many years after the first postman, it\nremained somewhat definite to the aged men; for, out of deference to a\npleasant, olden custom, and perhaps partly for an excuse to \"get down\nto the hotel\" (which was not altogether in favor with the elderly\nladies), most of them retained their antique boxes in the post-office,\nhappily in the next building.\n\nIn this connection it may be written that a subscription clerk in the\noffice of the Chicago Daily Standard, having noted a single subscriber\nfrom Canaan, was, a fortnight later, pleased to receive, by one mail,\nnine subscriptions from that promising town.  If one brought nine\nothers in a fortnight, thought he, what would nine bring in a month?\nAmazingly, they brought nothing, and the rest was silence.  Here was a\nmatter of intricate diplomacy never to come within that youth his ken.\nThe morning voyage to the post-office, long mocked as a fable and\nscreen by the families of the sages, had grown so difficult to\naccomplish for one of them, Colonel Flitcroft (Colonel in the war with\nMexico), that he had been put to it, indeed, to foot the firing-line\nagainst his wife (a lady of celebrated determination and hale-voiced at\nseventy), and to defend the rental of a box which had sheltered but\nthree missives in four years. Desperation is often inspiration; the\nColonel brilliantly subscribed for the Standard, forgetting to give his\nhouse address, and it took the others just thirteen days to wring his\nsecret from him.  Then the Standard served for all.\n\nMail-time had come to mean that bright hour when they all got their\nfeet on the brass rod which protected the sills of the two big windows,\nwith the steam-radiators sizzling like kettles against the side wall.\nMr. Jonas Tabor, who had sold his hardware business magnificently (not\nmagnificently for his nephew, the purchaser) some ten years before, was\nusually, in spite of the fact that he remained a bachelor at\nseventy-nine, the last to settle down with the others, though often the\nfirst to reach the hotel, which he always entered by a side door,\nbecause he did not believe in the treating system. And it was Mr. Eskew\nArp, only seventy-five, but already a thoroughly capable cynic, who,\nalmost invariably \"opened the argument,\" and it was he who discovered\nthe sinister intention behind the weather of this particular morning.\nMr. Arp had not begun life so sourly: as a youth he had been proud of\nhis given name, which had come to him through his mother's family, who\nhad made it honorable, but many years of explanations that Eskew did\nnot indicate his initials had lowered his opinion of the intelligence\nand morality of the race.\n\nThe malevolence of his voice and manner this morning, therefore, when\nhe shook his finger at the town beyond the windows, and exclaimed, with\na bitter laugh, \"Look at it!\" was no surprise to his companions.  \"Jest\nlook at it!  I tell you the devil is mighty smart.  Ha, ha!  Mighty\nsmart!\"\n\nThrough custom it was the duty of Squire Buckalew (Justice of the Peace\nin '59) to be the first to take up Mr. Arp.  The others looked to him\nfor it.  Therefore, he asked, sharply:\n\n\"What's the devil got to do with snow?\"\n\n\"Everything to do with it, sir,\" Mr. Arp retorted.  \"It's plain as day\nto anybody with eyes and sense.\"\n\n\"Then I wish you'd p'int it out,\" said Buckalew, \"if you've got either.\"\n\n\"By the Almighty, Squire\"--Mr. Arp turned in his chair with sudden\nheat--\"if I'd lived as long as you--\"\n\n\"You have,\" interrupted the other, stung. \"Twelve years ago!\"\n\n\"If I'd lived as long as you,\" Mr. Arp repeated, unwincingly, in a\nlouder voice, \"and had follered Satan's trail as long as you have, and\nyet couldn't recognize it when I see it, I'd git converted and vote\nProhibitionist.\"\n\n\"_I_ don't see it,\" interjected Uncle Joe Davey, in his querulous\nvoice.  (He was the patriarch of them all.)  \"_I_ can't find no\ncloven-hoof-prints in the snow.\"\n\n\"All over it, sir!\" cried the cynic.  \"All over it! Old Satan loves\ntricks like this.  Here's a town that's jest one squirmin' mass of lies\nand envy and vice and wickedness and corruption--\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" exclaimed Colonel Flitcroft.  \"That's a slander upon our\nhearths and our government. Why, when I was in the Council--\"\n\n\"It wasn't a bit worse then,\" Mr. Arp returned, unreasonably.  \"Jest\nyou look how the devil fools us. He drops down this here virgin mantle\non Canaan and makes it look as good as you pretend you think it is: as\ngood as the Sunday-school room of a country church--though THAT\"--he\nwent off on a tangent, venomously--\"is generally only another whited\nsepulchre, and the superintendent's mighty apt to have a bottle of\nwhiskey hid behind the organ, and--\"\n\n\"Look here, Eskew,\" said Jonas Tabor, \"that's got nothin' to do with--\"\n\n\"Why ain't it?  Answer me!\" cried Mr. Arp, continuing, without pause:\n\"Why ain't it?  Can't you wait till I git through?  You listen to me,\nand when I'm ready I'll listen to--\"\n\n\"See here,\" began the Colonel, making himself heard over three others,\n\"I want to ask you--\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" Mr. Arp pounded the floor irascibly with his hickory stick.\n\"Don't you ask me anything! How can you tell that I'm not going to\nanswer your question without your asking it, till I've got through?\nYou listen first.  I say, here's a town of nearly thirty thousand\ninhabitants, every last one of 'em--men, women, and children--selfish\nand cowardly and sinful, if you could see their innermost natures; a\ntown of the ugliest and worst built houses in the world, and governed\nby a lot of saloon-keepers--though I hope it 'll never git down to\nwhere the ministers can run it.  And the devil comes along, and in one\nnight--why, all you got to do is LOOK at it!  You'd think we needn't\never trouble to make it better.  That's what the devil wants us to\ndo--wants us to rest easy about it, and paints it up to look like a\nheaven of peace and purity and sanctified spirits.  Snowfall like this\nwould of made Lot turn the angel out-of-doors and say that the old home\nwas good enough for him.  Gomorrah would of looked like a Puritan\nvillage--though I'll bet my last dollar that there was a lot, and a\nWHOLE lot, that's never been told about Puritan villages.  A lot that--\"\n\n\"WHAT never was?\" interrupted Mr. Peter Bradbury, whose granddaughter\nhad lately announced her discovery that the Bradburys were descended\nfrom Miles Standish.  \"What wasn't told about Puritan villages?\"\n\n\"Can't you wait?\" Mr. Arp's accents were those of pain.  \"Haven't I got\nANY right to present my side of the case?  Ain't we restrained enough\nto allow of free speech here?  How can we ever git anywhere in an\nargument like this, unless we let one man talk at a time?  How--\"\n\n\"Go on with your statement,\" said Uncle Joe Davey, impatiently.\n\nMr. Arp's grievance was increased.  \"Now listen to YOU!  How many more\ninterruptions are comin'? I'll listen to the other side, but I've got\nto state mine first, haven't I?  If I don't make my point clear, what's\nthe use of the argument? Argumentation is only the comparison of two\nsides of a question, and you have to see what the first side IS before\nyou can compare it with the other one, don't you?  Are you all agreed\nto that?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the Colonel.  \"Go ahead.  We won't interrupt until\nyou're through.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" resumed Mr. Arp, with a fleeting expression of\nsatisfaction, \"as I said before, I wish to--as I said--\" He paused, in\nsome confusion.  \"As I said, argumentation is--that is, I say--\"  He\nstopped again, utterly at sea, having talked himself so far out of his\ncourse that he was unable to recall either his sailing port or his\ndestination.  Finally he said, feebly, to save the confession, \"Well,\ngo on with your side of it.\"\n\nThis generosity was for a moment disconcerting; however, the quietest\nof the party took up the opposition--Roger Tabor, a very thin, old man\nwith a clean-shaven face, almost as white as his hair, and melancholy,\ngentle, gray eyes, very unlike those of his brother Jonas, which were\ndark and sharp and button-bright.  (It was to Roger's son that Jonas\nhad so magnificently sold the hardware business.)  Roger was known in\nCanaan as \"the artist\"; there had never been another of his profession\nin the place, and the town knew not the word \"painter,\" except in\napplication to the useful artisan who is subject to lead-poisoning.\nThere was no indication of his profession in the attire of Mr. Tabor,\nunless the too apparent age of his black felt hat and a neat patch at\nthe elbow of his shiny, old brown overcoat might have been taken as\nsymbols of the sacrifice to his muse which his life had been.  He was\nnot a constant attendant of the conclave, and when he came it was\nusually to listen; indeed, he spoke so seldom that at the sound of his\nvoice they all turned to him with some surprise.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he began, \"that Eskew means the devil is behind all\nbeautiful things.\"\n\n\"Ugly ones, too,\" said Mr. Arp, with a start of recollection.  \"And I\nwish to state--\"\n\n\"Not now!\" Colonel Flitcroft turned upon him violently.  \"You've\nalready stated it.\"\n\n\"Then, if he is behind the ugly things, too,\" said Roger, \"we must take\nhim either way, so let us be glad of the beauty for its own sake.\nEskew says this is a wicked town.  It may be--I don't know. He says\nit's badly built; perhaps it is; but it doesn't seem to me that it's\nugly in itself.  I don't know what its real self is, because it wears\nso many aspects.  God keeps painting it all the time, and never shows\nme twice the same picture; not even two snowfalls are just alike, nor\nthe days that follow them; no more than two misty sunsets are\nalike--for the color and even the form of the town you call ugly are a\nmatter of the season of the year and of the time of day and of the\nlight and air.  The ugly town is like an endless gallery which you can\nwalk through, from year-end to year-end, never seeing the same canvas\ntwice, no matter how much you may want to--and there's the pathos of\nit.  Isn't it the same with people with the characters of all of us,\njust as it is with our faces?  No face remains the same for two\nsuccessive days--\"\n\n\"It don't?\" Colonel Flitcroft interrupted, with an explosive and rueful\nincredulity.  \"Well, I'd like to--\"  Second thoughts came to him almost\nimmediately, and, as much out of gallantry as through discretion,\nfearing that he might be taken as thinking of one at home, he relapsed\ninto silence.\n\nNot so with the others.  It was as if a firecracker had been dropped\ninto a sleeping poultry-yard.  Least of all could Mr. Arp contain\nhimself. At the top of his voice, necessarily, he agreed with Roger\nthat faces changed, not only from day to day, and not only because of\nlight and air and such things, but from hour to hour, and from minute\nto minute, through the hideous stimulus of hypocrisy.\n\nThe \"argument\" grew heated; half a dozen tidy quarrels arose; all the\nsages went at it fiercely, except Roger Tabor, who stole quietly away.\nThe aged men were enjoying themselves thoroughly, especially those who\nquarrelled.  Naturally, the frail bark of the topic which had been\nlaunched was whirled about by too many side-currents to remain long in\nsight, and soon became derelict, while the intellectual dolphins dove\nand tumbled in the depths.  At the end of twenty minutes Mr. Arp\nemerged upon the surface, and in his mouth was this:\n\n\"Tell me, why ain't the Church--why ain't the Church and the rest of\nthe believers in a future life lookin' for immortality at the other end\nof life, too?  If we're immortal, we always have been; then why don't\nthey ever speculate on what we were before we were born?  It's because\nthey're too blame selfish--don't care a flapdoodle about what WAS, all\nthey want is to go on livin' forever.\"\n\nMr. Arp's voice had risen to an acrid triumphancy, when it suddenly\nfaltered, relapsed to a murmur, and then to a stricken silence, as a\ntall, fat man of overpowering aspect threw open the outer door near by\nand crossed the lobby to the clerk's desk.  An awe fell upon the sages\nwith this advent. They were hushed, and after a movement in their\nchairs, with a strange effect of huddling, sat disconcerted and\nattentive, like school-boys at the entrance of the master.\n\nThe personage had a big, fat, pink face and a heavily undershot jaw,\nwhat whitish beard he wore following his double chin somewhat after the\nmanner displayed in the portraits of Henry the Eighth. His eyes, very\nbright under puffed upper lids, were intolerant and insultingly\npenetrating despite their small size.  Their irritability held a kind\nof hotness, and yet the personage exuded frost, not of the weather, all\nabout him.  You could not imagine man or angel daring to greet this\nbeing genially--sooner throw a kiss to Mount Pilatus!\n\n\"Mr. Brown,\" he said, with ponderous hostility, in a bull bass, to the\nclerk--the kind of voice which would have made an express train leave\nthe track and go round the other way--\"do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Judge,\" the clerk replied, swiftly, in tones as unlike those\nwhich he used for strange transients as a collector's voice in his\nladylove's ear is unlike that which he propels at delinquents.\n\n\"Do you see that snow?\" asked the personage, threateningly.\n\n\"Yes, Judge.\"  Mr. Brown essayed a placating smile.  \"Yes, indeed,\nJudge Pike.\"\n\n\"Has your employer, the manager of this hotel, seen that snow?\" pursued\nthe personage, with a gesture of unspeakable solemn menace.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  I think so.  Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you think he fully understands that I am the proprietor of this\nbuilding?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Judge, cer--\"\n\n\"You will inform him that I do not intend to be discommoded by his\nnegligence as I pass to my offices.  Tell him from me that unless he\nkeeps the sidewalks in front of this hotel clear of snow I will cancel\nhis lease.  Their present condition is outrageous.  Do you understand\nme?  Outrageous! Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, Judge, I do so,\" answered the clerk, hoarse with respect.  \"I'll\nsee to it this minute, Judge Pike.\"\n\n\"You had better.\"  The personage turned himself about and began a grim\nprogress towards the door by which he had entered, his eyes fixing\nthemselves angrily upon the conclave at the windows.\n\nColonel Flitcroft essayed a smile, a faltering one.\n\n\"Fine weather, Judge Pike,\" he said, hopefully.\n\nThere was no response of any kind; the undershot jaw became more\nintolerant.  The personage made his opinion of the group\ndisconcertingly plain, and the old boys understood that he knew them\nfor a worthless lot of senile loafers, as great a nuisance in his\nbuilding as was the snow without; and much too evident was his unspoken\nthreat to see that the manager cleared them out of there before long.\n\nHe nodded curtly to the only man of substance among them, Jonas Tabor,\nand shut the door behind him with majestic insult.  He was Canaan's\nmillionaire.\n\nHe was one of those dynamic creatures who leave the haunting impression\nof their wills behind them, like the tails of Bo-Peep's sheep, like the\nevil dead men have done; he left his intolerant image in the ether for\na long time after he had gone, to confront and confound the aged men\nand hold them in deferential and humiliated silence. Each of them was\nmysteriously lowered in his own estimation, and knew that he had been\nmade to seem futile and foolish in the eyes of his fellows. They were\nall conscious, too, that the clerk had been acutely receptive of Judge\nPike's reading of them; that he was reviving from his own squelchedness\nthrough the later snubbing of the colonel; also that he might further\nseek to recover his poise by an attack on them for cluttering up the\noffice.\n\nNaturally, Jonas Tabor was the first to speak. \"Judge Pike's lookin'\nmighty well,\" he said, admiringly.\n\n\"Yes, he is,\" ventured Squire Buckalew, with deference; \"mighty well.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" echoed Peter Bradbury; \"mighty well.\"\n\n\"He's a great man,\" wheezed Uncle Joe Davey; \"a great man, Judge Martin\nPike; a great man!\"\n\n\"I expect he has considerable on his mind,\" said the Colonel, who had\ngrown very red.  \"I noticed that he hardly seemed to see us.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Mr. Bradbury corroborated, with an attempt at an amused\nlaugh.  \"I noticed it, too. Of course a man with all his cares and\ninterests must git absent-minded now and then.\"\n\n\"Of course he does,\" said the colonel.  \"A man with all his\nresponsibilities--\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so,\" came a chorus of the brethren, finding comfort and\nreassurance as their voices and spirits began to recover from the\nblight.\n\n\"There's a party at the Judge's to-night,\" said Mr. Bradbury--\"kind of\na ball Mamie Pike's givin' for the young folks.  Quite a doin's, I\nhear.\"\n\n\"That's another thing that's ruining Canaan,\" Mr. Arp declared,\nmorosely.  \"These entertainments they have nowadays.  Spend all the\nmoney out of town--band from Indianapolis, chicken salad and darkey\nwaiters from Chicago!  And what I want to know is, What's this town\ngoin' to do about the nigger question?\"\n\n\"What about it?\" asked Mr. Davey, belligerently.\n\n\"What about it?\" Mr. Arp mocked, fiercely. \"You better say, 'What about\nit?'\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" maintained Mr. Davey, steadfastly.\n\n\"I'll bet there ain't any less than four thousand niggers in Canaan\nto-day!\" Mr. Arp hammered the floor with his stick.  \"Every last one of\n'em criminals, and more comin' on every train.\"\n\n\"No such a thing,\" said Squire Buckalew, living up to his bounden duty.\n\"You look down the street.  There's the ten-forty-five comin' in now.\nI'll bet you a straight five-cent Peek-a-Boo cigar there ain't ary\nnigger on the whole train, except the sleepin'-car porters.\"\n\n\"What kind of a way to argue is that?\" demanded Mr. Arp, hotly.\n\"Bettin' ain't proof, is it?  Besides, that's the through express from\nthe East.  I meant trains from the South.\"\n\n\"You didn't say so,\" retorted Buckalew, triumphantly.  \"Stick to your\nbet, Eskew, stick to your bet.\"\n\n\"My bet!\" cried the outraged Eskew.  \"Who offered to bet?\"\n\n\"You did,\" replied the Squire, with perfect assurance and sincerity.\nThe others supported him in the heartiest spirit of on-with-the-dance,\nand war and joy were unconfined.\n\nA decrepit hack or two, a couple of old-fashioned surreys, and a few\n\"cut-unders\" drove by, bearing the newly arrived and their valises, the\nhotel omnibus depositing several commercial travellers at the door.  A\nsolitary figure came from the station on foot, and when it appeared\nwithin fair range of the window, Uncle Joe Davey, who had but hovered\non the flanks of the combat, first removed his spectacles and wiped\nthem, as though distrusting the vision they offered him, then,\nreplacing them, scanned anew the approaching figure and uttered a\nsmothered cry.\n\n\"My Lord A'mighty!\" he gasped.  \"What's this?  Look there!\"\n\nThey looked.  A truce came involuntarily, and they sat in paralytic\nsilence as the figure made its stately and sensational progress along\nMain Street.\n\nNot only the aged men were smitten.  Men shovelling snow from the\npavements stopped suddenly in their labors; two women, talking busily\non a doorstep, were stilled and remained in frozen attitudes as it\npassed; a grocer's clerk, crossing the pavement, carrying a heavily\nladen basket to his delivery wagon, halted half-way as the figure came\nnear, and then, making a pivot of his heels as it went by, behaved\ntowards it as does the magnetic needle to the pole.\n\nIt was that of a tall gentleman, cheerfully, though somewhat with\nennui, enduring his nineteenth winter.  His long and slender face he\nwore smiling, beneath an accurately cut plaster of dark hair cornicing\nhis forehead, a fashion followed by many youths of that year.  This\nperfect bang was shown under a round black hat whose rim was so small\nas almost not to be there at all; and the head was supported by a\nwaxy-white sea-wall of collar, rising three inches above the blue\nbillows of a puffed cravat, upon which floated a large, hollow pearl.\nHis ulster, sporting a big cape at the shoulders, and a tasselled hood\nover the cape, was of a rough Scotch cloth, patterned in faint,\ngray-and-white squares the size of baggage-checks, and it was so long\nthat the skirts trailed in the snow.  His legs were lost in the\naccurately creased, voluminous garments that were the tailors' canny\nreaction from the tight trousers with which the 'Eighties had begun:\nthey were, in color, a palish russet, broadly striped with gray, and,\nin size, surpassed the milder spirit of fashion so far as they\npermitted a liberal knee action to take place almost without\nsuperficial effect.  Upon his feet glistened long shoes, shaped, save\nfor the heels, like sharp racing-shells; these were partially protected\nby tan-colored low gaiters with flat, shiny, brown buttons.  In one\nhand the youth swung a bone-handled walking-stick, perhaps an inch and\na half in diameter, the other carried a yellow leather banjo-case, upon\nthe outer side of which glittered the embossed-silver initials, \"E. B.\"\nHe was smoking, but walked with his head up, making use, however, of a\ngait at that time new to Canaan, a seeming superbly irresponsible\nlounge, engendering much motion of the shoulders, producing an effect\nof carelessness combined with independence--an effect which the\ninnocent have been known to hail as an unconscious one.\n\nHe looked about him as he came, smilingly, with an expression of\nprincely amusement--as an elderly cabinet minister, say, strolling\nabout a village where he had spent some months in his youth, a hamlet\nwhich he had then thought large and imposing, but which, being\nrevisited after years of cosmopolitan glory, appeals to his whimsy and\nhis pity.  The youth's glance at the court-house unmistakably said:\n\"Ah, I recall that odd little box. I thought it quite large in the days\nbefore I became what I am now, and I dare say the good townsfolk still\nthink it an imposing structure!\" With everything in sight he deigned to\nbe amused, especially with the old faces in the \"National House\"\nwindows.  To these he waved his stick with airy graciousness.\n\n\"My soul!\" said Mr. Davey.  \"It seems to know some of us!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Mr. Arp, his voice recovered, \"and _I_ know IT.\"\n\n\"You do?\" exclaimed the Colonel.\n\n\"I do, and so do you.  It's Fanny Louden's boy, 'Gene, come home for\nhis Christmas holidays.\"\n\n\"By George! you're right,\" cried Flitcroft; \"I recognize him now.\"\n\n\"But what's the matter with him?\" asked Mr. Bradbury, eagerly.  \"Has he\njoined some patent-medicine troupe?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" replied Eskew.  \"He went East to college last fall.\"\n\n\"Do they MAKE the boys wear them clothes?\" persisted Bradbury.  \"Is it\nsome kind of uniform?\"\n\n\"I don't care what it is,\" said Jonas Tabor.  \"If I was Henry Louden I\nwouldn't let him wear 'em around here.\"\n\n\"Oh, you wouldn't, wouldn't you, Jonas?\" Mr. Arp employed the accents\nof sarcasm.  \"I'd like to see Henry Louden try to interfere with 'Gene\nBantry.  Fanny'd lock the old fool up in the cellar.\"\n\nThe lofty vision lurched out of view.\n\n\"I reckon,\" said the Colonel, leaning forward to see the last of it--\"I\nreckon Henry Louden's about the saddest case of abused step-father I\never saw.\"\n\n\"It's his own fault,\" said Mr. Arp--\"twice not havin' sense enough not\nto marry.  Him with a son of his own, too!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented the Colonel, \"marryin' a widow with a son of her own,\nand that widow Fanny!\"\n\n\"Wasn't it just the same with her first husband--Bantry?\" Mr. Davey\nasked, not for information, as he immediately answered himself.  \"You\nbet it was!  Didn't she always rule the roost?  Yes, she did.  She made\na god of 'Gene from the day he was born.  Bantry's house was run for\nhim, like Louden's is now.\"\n\n\"And look,\" exclaimed Mr. Arp, with satisfaction, \"at the way he's\nturned out!\"\n\n\"He ain't turned out at all yet; he's too young,\" said Buckalew.\n\"Besides, clothes don't make the man.\"\n\n\"Wasn't he smokin' a cigareet!\" cried Eskew, triumphantly.  This was\nfinal.\n\n\"It's a pity Henry Louden can't do something for his own son,\" said Mr.\nBradbury.  \"Why don't he send him away to college?\"\n\n\"Fanny won't let him,\" chuckled Mr. Arp, malevolently.  \"Takes all\ntheir spare change to keep 'Gene there in style.  I don't blame her.\n'Gene certainly acts the fool, but that Joe Louden is the orneriest boy\nI ever saw in an ornery world-full.\"\n\n\"He always was kind of misCHEEvous,\" admitted Buckalew.  \"I don't think\nhe's mean, though, and it does seem kind of not just right that Joe's\nfather's money--Bantry didn't leave anything to speak of--has to go to\nkeepin' 'Gene on the fat of the land, with Joe gittin' up at half-past\nfour to carry papers, and him goin' on nineteen years old.\"\n\n\"It's all he's fit for!\" exclaimed Eskew.  \"He's low down, I tell ye.\nAin't it only last week Judge Pike caught him shootin' craps with\nPike's nigger driver and some other nigger hired-men in the alley back\nof Pike's barn.\"\n\nMr. Schindlinger, the retired grocer, one of the silent members,\ncorroborated Eskew's information. \"I heert dot, too,\" he gave forth, in\nhis fat voice. \"He blays dominoes pooty often in der room back off\nLouie Farbach's tsaloon.  I see him myself. Pooty often.  Blayin' fer a\nleedle money--mit loafers!  Loafers!\"\n\n\"Pretty outlook for the Loudens!\" said Eskew Arp, much pleased.  \"One\nboy a plum fool and dressed like it, the other gone to the dogs\nalready!\"\n\n\"What could you expect Joe to be?\" retorted Squire Buckalew.  \"What\nchance has he ever had?  Long as I can remember Fanny's made him fetch\nand carry for 'Gene.  'Gene's had everything--all the fancy clothes,\nall the pocket-money, and now college!\"\n\n\"You ever hear that boy Joe talk politics?\" asked Uncle Joe Davey,\ncrossing a cough with a chuckle.  \"His head's so full of schemes fer\nrunning this town, and state, too, it's a wonder it don't bust.  Henry\nLouden told me he's see Joe set around and study by the hour how to\nsave three million dollars for the state in two years.\"\n\n\"And the best he can do for himself,\" added Eskew, \"is deliverin' the\nDaily Tocsin on a second-hand Star bicycle and gamblin' with niggers\nand riff-raff!  None of the nice young folks invite him to their doin's\nany more.\"\n\n\"That's because he's got so shabby he's quit goin' with em,\" said\nBuckalew.\n\n\"No, it ain't,\" snapped Mr. Arp.  \"It's because he's so low down.  He's\nno more 'n a town outcast.  There ain't ary one of the girls 'll have a\nthing to do with him, except that rip-rarin' tom-boy next door to\nLouden's; and the others don't have much to do with HER, neither, I can\ntell ye. That Arie Tabor--\"\n\nColonel Flitcroft caught him surreptitiously by the arm.  \"SH, Eskew!\"\nhe whispered.  \"Look out what you're sayin'!\"\n\n\"You needn't mind me,\" Jonas Tabor spoke up, crisply.  \"I washed my\nhands of all responsibility for Roger's branch of the family long ago.\nNever was one of 'em had the energy or brains to make a decent livin',\nbeginning with Roger; not one worth his salt!  I set Roger's son up in\nbusiness, and all the return he ever made me was to go into bankruptcy\nand take to drink, till he died a sot, like his wife did of shame.  I\ndone all I could when I handed him over my store, and I never expect to\nlift a finger for 'em again.  Ariel Tabor's my grandniece, but she\ndidn't act like it, and you can say anything you like about her, for\nwhat I care.  The last time I spoke to her was a year and a half ago,\nand I don't reckon I'll ever trouble to again.\"\n\n\"How was that, Jonas?\" quickly inquired Mr. Davey, who, being the\neldest of the party, was the most curious.  \"What happened?\"\n\n\"She was out in the street, up on that high bicycle of Joe Louden's.\nHe was teachin' her to ride, and she was sittin' on it like a man does.\nI stopped and told her she wasn't respectable. Sixteen years old, goin'\non seventeen!\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"Laughed,\" said Jonas, his voice becoming louder as the recital of his\nwrongs renewed their sting in his soul.  \"Laughed!\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I went up to her and told her she wasn't a decent girl, and shook the\nwheel.\"  Mr. Tabor illustrated by seizing the lapels of Joe Davey and\nshaking him.  \"I told her if her grandfather had any spunk she'd git an\nold-fashioned hidin' for behavin' that way.  And I shook the wheel\nagain.\" Here Mr. Tabor, forgetting in the wrath incited by the\nrecollection that he had not to do with an inanimate object, swung the\ngasping and helpless Mr. Davey rapidly back and forth in his chair. \"I\nshook it good and hard!\"\n\n\"What did she do then?\" asked Peter Bradbury.\n\n\"Fell off on me,\" replied Jonas, violently.  \"On purpose!\"\n\n\"I wisht she'd killed ye,\" said Mr. Davey, in a choking voice, as,\nreleased, he sank back in his chair.\n\n\"On purpose!\" repeated Jonas.  \"And smashed a straw hat I hadn't had\nthree months!  All to pieces!  So it couldn't be fixed!\"\n\n\"And what then?\" pursued Bradbury.\n\n\"SHE ran,\" replied Jonas, bitterly--\"ran!  And Joe Louden--Joe\nLouden--\"  He paused and gulped.\n\n\"What did he do?\" Peter leaned forward in his chair eagerly.\n\nThe narrator of the outrage gulped again, and opened and shut his mouth\nbefore responding.\n\n\"He said if I didn't pay for a broken spoke on his wheel he'd have to\nsue me!\"\n\nNo one inquired if Jonas had paid, and Jonas said no more.  The\nrecollection of his wrongs, together with the illustrative violence\noffered to Mr. Davey, had been too much for him.  He sank back,\npanting, in his chair, his hands fluttering nervously over his heart,\nand closed his eyes.\n\n\"I wonder why,\" ruminated Mr. Bradbury--\"I wonder why 'Gene Bantry\nwalked up from the deepo.  Don't seem much like his style.  Should\nthink he'd of rode up in a hack.\"\n\n\"Sho!\" said Uncle Joe Davey, his breath recovered.  \"He wanted to walk\nup past Judge Pike's, to see if there wasn't a show of Mamie's bein' at\nthe window, and give her a chance to look at that college uniform and\nbanjo-box and new walk of his.\"\n\nMr. Arp began to show signs of uneasiness.\n\n\"I'd like mighty well to know,\" he said, shifting round in his chair,\n\"if there's anybody here that's been able to answer the question I PUT,\nyesterday, just before we went home.  You all tried to, but I didn't\nhear anything I could consider anyways near even a fair argument.\"\n\n\"Who tried to?\" asked Buckalew, sharply, sitting up straight.  \"What\nquestion?\"\n\n\"What proof can you bring me,\" began Mr. Arp, deliberately, \"that we\nfolks, modernly, ain't more degenerate than the ancient Romans?\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nA RESCUE\n\nMain Street, already muffled by the snow, added to its quietude a\nfrozen hush where the wonder-bearing youth pursued his course along its\nwhite, straight way.  None was there in whom impertinence overmastered\nastonishment, or who recovered from the sight in time to jeer with\neffect; no \"Trab's boy\" gathered courage to enact in the thoroughfare a\nscene of mockery and of joy.  Leaving business at a temporary\nstand-still behind him, Mr. Bantry swept his long coat steadily over\nthe snow and soon emerged upon that part of the street where the mart\ngave way to the home.  The comfortable houses stood pleasantly back\nfrom the street, with plenty of lawn and shrubbery about them; and\noften, along the picket-fences, the laden branches of small cedars,\nbending low with their burden, showered the young man's swinging\nshoulders glitteringly as he brushed by.\n\nAnd now that expression he wore--the indulgent amusement of a man of\nthe world--began to disintegrate and show signs of change.  It became\nfinely grave, as of a high conventionality, lofty, assured, and\nmannered, as he approached the Pike mansion.  (The remotest stranger\nmust at once perceive that the Canaan papers could not have called it\notherwise without pain.)\n\nIt was a big, smooth-stone-faced house, product of the 'Seventies,\nfrowning under an outrageously insistent mansard, capped by a cupola,\nand staring out of long windows overtopped with \"ornamental\" slabs.\nTwo cast-iron deer, painted death-gray, twins of the same mould, stood\non opposite sides of the front walk, their backs towards it and each\nother, their bodies in profile to the street, their necks bent,\nhowever, so that they gazed upon the passer-by--yet gazed without\nemotion.  Two large, calm dogs guarded the top of the steps leading to\nthe front-door; they also were twins and of the same interesting metal,\nthough honored beyond the deer by coats of black paint and shellac.  It\nwas to be remarked that these dogs were of no distinguishable species\nor breed, yet they were unmistakably dogs; the dullest must have\nrecognized them as such at a glance, which was, perhaps, enough.  It\nwas a hideous house, important-looking, cold, yet harshly aggressive, a\nhouse whose exterior provoked a shuddering guess of the brass\nlambrequins and plush fringes within; a solid house, obviously--nay,\nblatantly--the residence of the principal citizen, whom it had grown to\nresemble, as is the impish habit of houses; and it sat in the middle of\nits flat acre of snowy lawn like a rich, fat man enraged and sitting\nstraight up in bed to swear.\n\nAnd yet there was one charming thing about this ugly house.  Some\nworkmen were enclosing a large side porch with heavy canvas, evidently\nfor festal purposes.  Looking out from between two strips of the canvas\nwas the rosy and delicate face of a pretty girl, smiling upon Eugene\nBantry as he passed.  It was an obviously pretty face, all the youth\nand prettiness there for your very first glance; elaborately pretty,\nlike the splendid profusion of hair about and above it--amber-colored\nhair, upon which so much time had been spent that a circle of large,\nround curls rose above the mass of it like golden bubbles tipping a\ncoronet.\n\nThe girl's fingers were pressed thoughtfully against her chin as Eugene\nstrode into view; immediately her eyes widened and brightened.  He\nswung along the fence with the handsomest appearance of\nunconsciousness, until he reached a point nearly opposite her.  Then he\nturned his head, as if haphazardly, and met her eyes.  At once she\nthrew out her hand towards him, waving him a greeting--a gesture which,\nas her fingers had been near her lips, was a little like throwing a\nkiss.  He crooked an elbow and with a one-two-three military movement\nremoved his small-brimmed hat, extended it to full arm's-length at the\nshoulder-level, returned it to his head with Life-Guard precision. This\nwas also new to Canaan.  He was letting Mamie Pike have it all at once.\n\nThe impression was as large as he could have desired.  She remained at\nthe opening in the canvas and watched him until he wagged his shoulders\nround the next corner and disappeared into a cross street.  As for\nEugene, he was calm with a great calm, and very red.\n\nHe had not covered a great distance, however, before his gravity was\nreplaced by his former smiling look of the landed gentleman amused by\nthe innocent pastimes of the peasants, though there was no one in sight\nexcept a woman sweeping some snow from the front steps of a cottage,\nand she, not perceiving him, retired in-doors without knowing her loss.\nHe had come to a thinly built part of the town, the perfect quiet of\nwhich made the sound he heard as he opened the picket gate of his own\nhome all the more startling.  It was a scream--loud, frantic, and\nterror-stricken.\n\nEugene stopped, with the gate half open.\n\nOut of the winter skeleton of a grape-arbor at one side of the\nfour-square brick house a brown-faced girl of seventeen precipitated\nherself through the air in the midst of a shower of torn card-board\nwhich she threw before her as she leaped.  She lit upon her toes and\nheaded for the gate at top speed, pursued by a pale young man whose\nthin arms strove spasmodically to reach her.  Scattering snow behind\nthem, hair flying, the pair sped on like two tattered branches before a\nhigh wind; for, as they came nearer Eugene (of whom, in the tensity of\ntheir flight, they took no note), it was to be seen that both were so\nshabbily dressed as to be almost ragged.  There was a brown patch upon\nthe girl's faded skirt at the knee; the shortness of the garment\nindicating its age to be something over three years, as well as\npermitting the knowledge to become more general than befitting that her\ncotton stockings had been clumsily darned in several places.  Her\npursuer was in as evil case; his trousers displayed a tendency to\nfringedness at pocket and heel; his coat, blowing open as he ran, threw\npennants of torn lining to the breeze, and made it too plain that there\nwere but three buttons on his waistcoat.\n\nThe girl ran beautifully, but a fleeter foot was behind her, and though\nshe dodged and evaded like a creature of the woods, the reaching hand\nfell upon the loose sleeve of her red blouse, nor fell lightly.  She\ngave a wrench of frenzy; the antique fabric refused the strain; parted\nat the shoulder seam so thoroughly that the whole sleeve came away--but\nnot to its owner's release, for she had been brought round by the jerk,\nso that, agile as she had shown herself, the pursuer threw an arm about\nher neck, before she could twist away, and held her.\n\nThere was a sharp struggle, as short as it was fierce.  Neither of\nthese extraordinary wrestlers spoke.  They fought.  Victory hung in the\nbalance for perhaps four seconds; then the girl was thrown heavily upon\nher back, in such a turmoil of snow that she seemed to be the mere\nnucleus of a white comet.  She struggled to get up, plying knee and\nelbow with a very anguish of determination; but her opponent held her,\npinioned both her wrists with one hand, and with the other rubbed great\nhandfuls of snow into her face, sparing neither mouth nor eyes.\n\n\"You will!\" he cried.  \"You will tear up my pictures!  A dirty trick,\nand you get washed for it!\"\n\nHalf suffocated, choking, gasping, she still fought on, squirming and\nkicking with such spirit that the pair of them appeared to the beholder\nlike figures of mist writhing in a fountain of snow.\n\nMore violence was to mar the peace of morning. Unexpectedly attacked\nfrom the rear, the conqueror was seized by the nape of the neck and one\nwrist, and jerked to his feet, simultaneously receiving a succession of\nkicks from his assailant. Prompted by an entirely natural curiosity, he\nessayed to turn his head to see who this might be, but a twist of his\nforearm and the pressure of strong fingers under his ear constrained\nhim to remain as he was; therefore, abandoning resistance, and, oddly\nenough, accepting without comment the indication that his captor\ndesired to remain for the moment incognito, he resorted calmly to\nexplanations.\n\n\"She tore up a picture of mine,\" he said, receiving the punishment\nwithout apparent emotion. \"She seemed to think because she'd drawn it\nherself she had a right to.\"\n\nThere was a slight whimsical droop at the corner of his mouth as he\nspoke, which might have been thought characteristic of him.  He was an\nodd-looking boy, not ill-made, though very thin and not tall.  His\npallor was clear and even, as though constitutional; the features were\ndelicate, almost childlike, but they were very slightly distorted,\nthrough nervous habit, to an expression at once wistful and humorous;\none eyebrow was a shade higher than the other, one side of the mouth\nslightly drawn down; the eyelids twitched a little, habitually; the\nfine, blue eyes themselves were almost comically reproachful--the look\nof a puppy who thinks you would not have beaten him if you had known\nwhat was in his heart.  All of this was in the quality of his voice,\ntoo, as he said to his invisible captor, with an air of detachment from\nany personal feeling:\n\n\"What peculiar shoes you wear!  I don't think I ever felt any so\npointed before.\"\n\nThe rescuing knight took no thought of offering to help the persecuted\ndamsel to arise; instead, he tightened his grip upon the prisoner's\nneck until, perforce, water--not tears--started from the latter's eyes.\n\n\"You miserable little muff,\" said the conqueror, \"what the devil do you\nmean, making this scene on our front lawn?\"\n\n\"Why, it's Eugene!\" exclaimed the helpless one. \"They didn't expect you\ntill to-night.  When did you get in?\"\n\n\"Just in time to give you a lesson, my buck,\" replied Bantry, grimly.\n\"In GOOD time for that, my playful step-brother.\"\n\nHe began to twist the other's wrist--a treatment of bone and ligament\nin the application of which school-boys and even freshmen are often\nadept. Eugene made the torture acute, and was apparently enjoying the\nwork, when suddenly--without any manner of warning--he received an\nastounding blow upon the left ear, which half stunned him for the\nmoment, and sent his hat flying and himself reeling, so great was the\nsurprise and shock of it. It was not a slap, not an open-handed push,\nnothing like it, but a fierce, well-delivered blow from a clinched fist\nwith the shoulder behind it, and it was the girl who had given it.\n\n\"Don't you dare to touch Joe!\" she cried, passionately.  \"Don't you lay\na finger on him.\"\n\nFurious and red, he staggered round to look at her.\n\n\"You wretched little wild-cat, what do you mean by that?\" he broke out.\n\n\"Don't you touch Joe!\" she panted.  \"Don't you--\"  Her breath caught\nand there was a break in her voice as she faced him.  She could not\nfinish the repetition of that cry, \"Don't you touch Joe!\"\n\nBut there was no break in the spirit, that passion of protection which\nhad dealt the blow.  Both boys looked at her, something aghast.\n\nShe stood before them, trembling with rage and shivering with cold in\nthe sudden wind which had come up.  Her hair had fallen and blew across\nher streaming face in brown witch-wisps; one of the ill-darned\nstockings had come down and hung about her shoe in folds full of snow;\nthe arm which had lost its sleeve was bare and wet; thin as the arm of\na growing boy, it shook convulsively, and was red from shoulder to\nclinched fist.  She was covered with snow.  Mists of white drift blew\nacross her, mercifully half veiling her.\n\nEugene recovered himself.  He swung round upon his heel, restored his\nhat to his head with precision, picked up his stick and touched his\nbanjo-case with it.\n\n\"Carry that into the house,\" he said, indifferently, to his\nstep-brother.\n\n\"Don't you do it!\" said the girl, hotly, between her chattering teeth.\n\nEugene turned towards her, wearing the sharp edge of a smile.  Not\nremoving his eyes from her face, he produced with deliberation a flat\nsilver box from a pocket, took therefrom a cigarette, replaced the box,\nextracted a smaller silver box from another pocket, shook out of it a\nfusee, slowly lit the cigarette--this in a splendid silence, which he\nfinally broke to say, languidly, but with particular distinctness:\n\n\"Ariel Tabor, go home!\"\n\nThe girl's teeth stopped chattering, her lips remaining parted; she\nshook the hair out of her eyes and stared at him as if she did not\nunderstand, but Joe Louden, who had picked up the banjo-case\nobediently, burst into cheerful laughter.\n\n\"That's it, 'Gene,\" he cried, gayly.  \"That's the way to talk to her!\"\n\n\"Stow it, you young cub,\" replied Eugene, not turning to him.  \"Do you\nthink I'm trying to be amusing?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by 'stow it,'\" Joe began, \"but if--\"\n\n\"I mean,\" interrupted the other, not relaxing his faintly smiling stare\nat the girl--\"I mean that Ariel Tabor is to go home.  Really, we can't\nhave this kind of thing occurring upon our front lawn!\"\n\nThe flush upon her wet cheeks deepened and became dark; even her arm\ngrew redder as she gazed back at him.  In his eyes was patent his\ncomplete realization of the figure she cut, of this bare arm, of the\nstrewn hair, of the fallen stocking, of the ragged shoulder of her\nblouse, of her patched short skirt, of the whole dishevelled little\nfigure.  He was the master of the house, and he was sending her home as\nill-behaved children are sent home by neighbors.\n\nThe immobile, amused superiority of this proprietor of silver boxes,\nthis wearer of strange and brilliant garments, became slightly\nintensified as he pointed to the fallen sleeve, a rag of red and snow,\nlying near her feet.\n\n\"You might take that with you?\" he said, interrogatively.\n\nHer gaze had not wavered in meeting his, but at this her eyelashes\nbegan to wink uncontrollably, her chin to tremble.  She bent over the\nsleeve and picked it up, before Joe Louden, who had started towards\nher, could do it for her.  Then turning, her head still bent so that\nher face was hidden from both of them, she ran out of the gate.\n\n\"DO go!\" Joe called after her, vehemently.  \"Go! Just to show what a\nfool you are to think 'Gene's in earnest.\"\n\nHe would have followed, but his step-brother caught him by the arm.\n\"Don't stop her,\" said Eugene.  \"Can't you tell when I AM in earnest,\nyou bally muff!\"\n\n\"I know you are,\" returned the other, in a low voice.  \"I didn't want\nher to think so for your sake.\"\n\n\"Thousands of thanks,\" said Eugene, airily. \"You are a wise young\njudge.  She couldn't stay--in THAT state, could she?  I sent her for\nher own good.\"\n\n\"She could have gone in the house and your mother might have loaned her\na jacket,\" returned Joe, swallowing.  \"You had no business to make her\ngo out in the street like that.\"\n\nEugene laughed.  \"There isn't a soul in sight--and there, she's all\nright now.  She's home.\"\n\nAriel had run along the fence until she came to the next gate, which\nopened upon a walk leading to a shabby, meandering old house of one\nstory, with a very long, low porch, once painted white, running the\nfull length of the front.  Ariel sprang upon the porch and disappeared\nwithin the house.\n\nJoe stood looking after her, his eyelashes winking as had hers.  \"You\noughtn't to have treated her that way,\" he said, huskily.\n\nEugene laughed again.  \"How were YOU treating her when I came up?  You\nbully her all you want to yourself, but nobody else must say even a\nfatherly word to her!\"\n\n\"That wasn't bullying,\" explained Joe.  \"We fight all the time.\"\n\n\"Mais oui!\" assented Eugene.  \"I fancy!\"\n\n\"What?\" said the other, blankly.\n\n\"Pick up that banjo-case again and come on,\" commanded Mr. Bantry,\ntartly.  \"Where's the mater?\"\n\nJoe stared at him.  \"Where's what?\"\n\n\"The mater!\" was the frowning reply.\n\n\"Oh yes, I know!\" said Joe, looking at his step-brother curiously.\n\"I've seen it in stories.  She's up-stairs.  You'll be a surprise.\nYou're wearing lots of clothes, 'Gene.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will seem so to Canaan,\" returned the other, weariedly.\n\"Governor feeling fit?\"\n\n\"I never saw him,\" Joe replied; then caught himself.  \"Oh, I see what\nyou mean!  Yes, he's all right.\"\n\nThey had come into the hall, and Eugene was removing the long coat,\nwhile his step-brother looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"'Gene,\" asked the latter, in a softened voice, \"have you seen Mamie\nPike yet?\"\n\n\"You will find, my young friend,\" responded Mr. Bantry, \"if you ever go\nabout much outside of Canaan, that ladies' names are not supposed to be\nmentioned indiscriminately.\"\n\n\"It's only,\" said Joe, \"that I wanted to say that there's a dance at\ntheir house to-night.  I suppose you'll be going?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  Are you?\"\n\nBoth knew that the question was needless; but Joe answered, gently:\n\n\"Oh no, of course not.\"  He leaned over and fumbled with one foot as if\nto fasten a loose shoe-string.  \"She wouldn't be very likely to ask me.\"\n\n\"Well, what about it?\"\n\n\"Only that--that Arie Tabor's going.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" Eugene paused on the stairs, which he had begun to ascend.\n\"Very interesting.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" continued Joe, hopefully, straightening up to look at him,\n\"that maybe you'd dance with her.  I don't believe many will ask\nher--I'm afraid they won't--and if you would, even only once, it would\nkind of make up for\"--he faltered--\"for out there,\" he finished,\nnodding his head in the direction of the gate.\n\nIf Eugene vouchsafed any reply, it was lost in a loud, shrill cry from\nabove, as a small, intensely nervous-looking woman in blue silk ran\nhalf-way down the stairs to meet him and caught him tearfully in her\narms.\n\n\"Dear old mater!\" said Eugene.\n\nJoe went out of the front-door quickly.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nOLD HOPES\n\nThe door which Ariel had entered opened upon a narrow hall, and down\nthis she ran to her own room, passing, with face averted, the entrance\nto the broad, low-ceilinged chamber that had served Roger Tabor as a\nstudio for almost fifty years.  He was sitting there now, in a hopeless\nand disconsolate attitude, with his back towards the double doors,\nwhich were open, and had been open since their hinges had begun to give\nway, when Ariel was a child.  Hearing her step, he called her name, but\ndid not turn; and, receiving no answer, sighed faintly as he heard her\nown door close upon her.\n\nThen, as his eyes wandered about the many canvases which leaned against\nthe dingy walls, he sighed again.  Usually they showed their brown\nbacks, but to-day he had turned them all to face outward.  Twilight,\nsunset, moonlight (the Court-house in moonlight), dawn, morning, noon\n(Main Street at noon), high summer, first spring, red autumn,\nmidwinter, all were there--illimitably detailed, worked to a smoothness\nlike a glaze, and all lovingly done with unthinkable labor.\n\nAnd there were \"Italian Flower-Sellers,\" damsels with careful hair, two\nfigures together, one blonde, the other as brunette as lampblack, the\nblonde--in pink satin and blue slippers--leaning against a pillar and\nsmiling over the golden coins for which she had exchanged her posies;\nthe brunette seated at her feet, weeping upon an unsold bouquet.  There\nwere red-sashed \"Fisher Lads\" wading with butterfly-nets on their\nshoulders; there was a \"Tying the Ribbon on Pussy's Neck\"; there were\nportraits in oil and petrifactions in crayon, as hard and tight as the\npurses of those who had refused to accept them, leaving them upon their\nmaker's hands because the likeness had failed.\n\nAfter a time the old man got up, went to his easel near a window, and,\nsighing again, began patiently to work upon one of these failures--a\nportrait, in oil, of a savage old lady, which he was doing from a\nphotograph.  The expression of the mouth and the shape of the nose had\nnot pleased her descendants and the beneficiaries under the will, and\nit was upon the images of these features that Roger labored.  He leaned\nfar forward, with his face close to the canvas, holding his brushes\nafter the Spencerian fashion, working steadily through the afternoon,\nand, when the light grew dimmer, leaning closer to his canvas to see.\nWhen it had become almost dark in the room, he lit a student-lamp with\na green-glass shade, and, placing it upon a table beside him, continued\nto paint. Ariel's voice interrupted him at last.\n\n\"It's quitting-time, grandfather,\" she called, gently, from the doorway\nbehind him.\n\nHe sank back in his chair, conscious, for the first time, of how tired\nhe had grown.  \"I suppose so,\" he said, \"though it seemed to me that I\nwas just getting my hand in.\"  His eyes brightened for a moment.  \"I\ndeclare, I believe I've caught it a great deal better.  Come and look,\nAriel.  Doesn't it seem to you that I'm getting it?  Those pearly\nshadows in the flesh--\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it.  Those people ought to be very proud to have it.\"  She\ncame to him quietly, took the palette and brushes from his hands and\nbegan to clean them, standing in the shadow behind him. \"It's too good\nfor them.\"\n\n\"I wonder if it is,\" he said, slowly, leaning forward and curving his\nhands about his eyes so as to shut off everything from his view except\nthe canvas.  \"I wonder if it is!\" he repeated.  Then his hands dropped\nsadly in his lap, and he sank back again with a patient kind of\nrevulsion.  \"No, no, it isn't!  I always think they're good when I've\njust finished them.  I've been fooled that way all my life.  They don't\nlook the same afterwards.\"\n\n\"They're always beautiful,\" she said, softly.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" he sighed.\n\n\"Now, Roger!\" she cried, with cheerful sharpness, continuing her work.\n\n\"I know,\" he said, with a plaintive laugh,--\"I know.  Sometimes I think\nthat all my reward has been in the few minutes I've had just after\nfinishing them.  During those few minutes I seem to see in them all\nthat I wanted to put in them; I see it because what I've been trying to\nexpress is still so warm in my own eyes that I seem to have got it on\nthe canvas where I wanted it.\"\n\n\"But you do,\" she said.  \"You do get it there.\"\n\n\"No,\" he murmured, in return.  \"I never did. I got out some of the old\nones when I came in this morning, some that I hadn't looked at for\nyears, and it's the same with them.  You can do it much better\nyourself--your sketches show it.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she protested, quickly.\n\n\"Yes, they do; and I wondered if it was only because you were young.\nBut those I did when I was young are almost the same as the ones I\npaint now.  I haven't learned much.  There hasn't been any one to show\nme!  And you can't learn from print, never!  Yet I've grown in what I\nSEE--grown so that the world is full of beauty to me that I never\ndreamed of seeing when I began. But I can't paint it--I can't get it on\nthe canvas. Ah, I think I might have known how to, if I hadn't had to\nteach myself, if I could only have seen how some of the other fellows\ndid their work. If I'd ever saved money to get away from Canaan--if I\ncould have gone away from it and come back knowing how to paint it--if\nI could have got to Paris for just one month!  PARIS--for just one\nmonth!\"\n\n\"Perhaps we will; you can't tell what MAY happen.\" It was always her\nreply to this cry of his.\n\n\"PARIS--for just one month!\" he repeated, with infinite wistfulness,\nand then realizing what an old, old cry it was with him, he shook his\nhead, impatiently sniffing out a laugh at himself, rose and went\npottering about among the canvases, returning their faces to the wall,\nand railing at them mutteringly.\n\n\"Whatever took me into it, I don't know.  I might have done something\nuseful.  But I couldn't bring myself ever to consider doing anything\nelse--I couldn't bear even to think of it!  Lord forgive me, I even\ntried to encourage your father to paint. Perhaps he might as well, poor\nboy, as to have put all he'd made into buying Jonas out.  Ah me! There\nyou go, 'Flower-Girls'!  Turn your silly faces to the wall and smile\nand cry there till I'm gone and somebody throws you on a bonfire.  I'LL\nnever look at you again.\"  He paused, with the canvas half turned.\n\"And yet,\" he went on, reflectively, \"a man promised me thirty-five\ndollars for that picture once.  I painted it to order, but he went away\nbefore I finished it, and never answered the letters I wrote him about\nit.  I wish I had the money now--perhaps we could have more than two\nmeals a day.\"\n\n\"We don't need more,\" said Ariel, scraping the palette attentively.\n\"It's healthier with only breakfast and supper.  I think I'd rather\nhave a new dress than dinner.\"\n\n\"I dare say you would,\" the old man mused. \"You're young--you're young.\nWhat were you doing all this afternoon, child?\"\n\n\"In my room, trying to make over mamma's wedding-dress for to-night.\"\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\n\"Mamie Pike invited me to a dance at their house.\"\n\n\"Very well; I'm glad you're going to be gay,\" he said, not seeing the\nfaintly bitter smile that came to her face.\n\n\"I don't think I'll be very gay,\" she answered.\n\n\"I don't know why I go--nobody ever asks me to dance.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" he asked, with an old man's astonishment.\n\n\"I don't know.  Perhaps it's because I don't dress very well.\"  Then,\nas he made a sorrowful gesture, she cut him off before he could speak.\n\"Oh, it isn't altogether because we're poor; it's more I don't know how\nto wear what I've got, the way some girls do.  I never cared much\nand--well, I'M not worrying, Roger!  And I think I've done a good deal\nwith mamma's dress.  It's a very grand dress.  I wonder I never thought\nof wearing it until to-day.  I may be\"--she laughed and blushed--\"I may\nbe the belle of the ball--who knows!\"\n\n\"You'll want me to walk over with you and come for you afterwards, I\nexpect.\"\n\n\"Only to take me.  It may be late when I come away--if a good many\nSHOULD ask me to dance, for once!  Of course I could come home alone.\nBut Joe Louden is going to sort of hang around outside, and he'll meet\nme at the gate and see me safe home.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed, blankly.\n\n\"Isn't it all right?\" she asked.\n\n\"I think I'd better come for you,\" he answered, gently.  \"The truth is,\nI--I think you'd better not be with Joe Louden a great deal.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, he doesn't seem a vicious boy to me, but I'm afraid he's getting\nrather a bad name, my dear.\"\n\n\"He's not getting one,\" she said, gravely.  \"He's already got one.\nHe's had a bad name in Canaan for a long while.  It grew in the first\nplace out of shabbiness and mischief, but it did grow; and if people\nkeep on giving him a bad name the time will come when he'll live up to\nit.  He's not any worse than I am, and I guess my own name isn't too\ngood--for a girl.  And yet, so far, there's nothing against him except\nhis bad name.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there is,\" said Roger.  \"It doesn't look very well for a\nyoung man of his age to be doing no better than delivering papers.\"\n\n\"It gives him time to study law,\" she answered, quickly.  \"If he\nclerked all day in a store, he couldn't.\"\n\n\"I didn't know he was studying now.  I thought I'd heard that he was in\na lawyer's office for a few weeks last year, and was turned out for\nsetting fire to it with a pipe--\"\n\n\"It was an accident,\" she interposed.\n\n\"But some pretty important papers were burned, and after that none of\nthe other lawyers would have him.\"\n\n\"He's not in an office,\" she admitted.  \"I didn't mean that.  But he\nstudies a great deal.  He goes to the courts all the time they're in\nsession, and he's bought some books of his own.\"\n\n\"Well--perhaps,\" he assented; \"but they say he gambles and drinks, and\nthat last week Judge Pike threatened to have him arrested for throwing\ndice with some negroes behind the Judge's stable.\"\n\n\"What of it?  I'm about the only nice person in town that will have\nanything to do with him--and nobody except you thinks I'M very nice!\"\n\n\"Ariel!  Ariel!\"\n\n\"I know all about his gambling with darkies,\" she continued, excitedly,\nher voice rising, \"and I know that he goes to saloons, and that he's an\nintimate friend of half the riffraff in town; and I know the reason for\nit, too, because he's told me.  He wants to know them, to understand\nthem; and he says some day they'll make him a power, and then he can\nhelp them!\"\n\nThe old man laughed helplessly.  \"But I can't let him bring you home,\nmy dear.\"\n\nShe came to him slowly and laid her hands upon his shoulders.\nGrandfather and granddaughter were nearly of the same height, and she\nlooked squarely into his eyes.  \"Then you must say it is because you\nwant to come for me, not because I mustn't come with Joe.\"\n\n\"But I think it is a little because you mustn't come with Joe,\" he\nanswered, \"especially from the Pikes'.  Don't you see that it mightn't\nbe well for Joe himself, if the Judge should happen to see him?  I\nunderstand he warned the boy to keep away from the neighborhood\nentirely or he would have him locked up for dice-throwing.  The Judge\nis a very influential man, you know, and as determined in matters like\nthis as he is irritable.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you put it on that ground,\" the girl replied, her eyes\nsoftening, \"I think you'd better come for me yourself.\"\n\n\"Very well, I put it on that ground,\" he returned, smiling upon her.\n\n\"Then I'll send Joe word and get supper,\" she said, kissing him.\n\nIt was the supper-hour not only for them but everywhere in Canaan, and\nthe cold air of the streets bore up and down and around corners the\nsmell of things frying.  The dining-room windows of all the houses\nthrew bright patches on the snow of the side-yards; the windows of\nother rooms, except those of the kitchens, were dark, for the rule of\nthe place was Puritanical in thrift, as in all things; and the good\nhousekeepers disputed every record of the meters with unhappy\ngas-collectors.\n\nThere was no better housekeeper in town than Mrs. Louden, nor a\nthriftier, but hers was one of the few houses in Canaan, that evening,\nwhich showed bright lights in the front rooms while the family were at\nsupper.  It was proof of the agitation caused by the arrival of Eugene\nthat she forgot to turn out the gas in her parlor, and in the chamber\nshe called a library, on her way to the evening meal.\n\nThat might not have been thought a cheerful feast for Joe Louden.  The\nfatted calf was upon the board, but it had not been provided for the\nprodigal, who, in this case, was the brother that stayed at home: the\nfete rewarded the good brother, who had been in strange lands, and the\ngood one had found much honor in his wanderings, as he carelessly let\nit appear.  Mrs. Louden brightened inexpressibly whenever Eugene spoke\nof himself, and consequently she glowed most of the time.  Her\nhusband--a heavy, melancholy, silent man with a grizzled beard and no\nmustache--lowered at Joe throughout the meal, but appeared to take a\nstrange comfort in his step-son's elegance and polish.  Eugene wore new\nevening clothes and was lustrous to eye and ear.\n\nJoe escaped as soon as he could, though not before the count of his\nlater sins had been set before Eugene in detail, in mass, and in all of\ntheir depth, breadth, and thickness.  His father spoke but once, after\nnodding heavily to confirm all points of Mrs. Louden's recital.\n\n\"You better use any influence you've got with your brother,\" he said to\nEugene, \"to make him come to time.  I can't do anything with him.  If\nhe gets in trouble, he needn't come to me!  I'll never help him again.\nI'm TIRED of it!\"\n\nEugene glanced twinklingly at the outcast.  \"I didn't know he was such\na roarer as all that!\" he said, lightly, not taking Joe as of enough\nconsequence to be treated as a sinner.\n\nThis encouraged Mrs. Louden to pathos upon the subject of her shame\nbefore other women when Joe happened to be mentioned, and the supper\nwas finished with the topic.  Joe slipped away through the kitchen,\nsneakingly, and climbed the back fence.  In the alley he lit a cheap\ncigarette, and thrusting his hands into his pockets and shivering\nviolently--for he had no overcoat,--walked away singing to himself, \"A\nSpanish cavalier stood in his retreat,\" his teeth affording an\nappropriate though involuntary castanet accompaniment.\n\nHis movements throughout the earlier part of that evening are of\nuncertain report.  It is known that he made a partial payment of\nforty-five cents at a second-hand book-store for a number of\nvolumes--Grindstaff on Torts and some others--which he had negotiated\non the instalment system; it is also believed that he won twenty-eight\ncents playing seven-up in the little room behind Louie Farbach's bar;\nbut these things are of little import compared to the established fact\nthat at eleven o'clock he was one of the ball guests at the Pike\nMansion.  He took no active part in the festivities, nor was he one of\nthe dancers: his was, on the contrary, the role of a quiet observer.\nHe lay stretched at full length upon the floor of the enclosed porch\n(one of the strips of canvas was later found to have been loosened),\nwedged between the outer railing and a row of palms in green tubs.  The\nposition he occupied was somewhat too draughty to have been recommended\nby a physician, but he commanded, between the leaves of the screening\npalms, an excellent view of the room nearest the porch.  A long window,\nopen, afforded communication between this room, one of those used for\ndancing, and the dim bower which had been made of the veranda, whither\nflirtatious couples made their way between the dances.\n\nIt was not to play eavesdropper upon any of these that the uninvited\nJoe had come.  He was not there to listen, and it is possible that, had\nthe curtains of other windows afforded him the chance to behold the\ndance, he might not have risked the dangers of his present position.\nHe had not the slightest interest in the whispered coquetries that he\nheard; he watched only to catch now and then, over the shoulders of the\ndancers, a fitful glimpse of a pretty head that flitted across the\nwindow--the amber hair of Mamie Pike.  He shivered in the draughts; and\nthe floor of the porch was cement, painful to elbow and knee, the space\nwhere he lay cramped and narrow; but the golden bubbles of her hair,\nthe shimmer of her dainty pink dress, and the fluffy wave of her lace\nscarf as she crossed and recrossed in a waltz, left him, apparently, in\nno discontent.  He watched with parted lips, his pale cheeks reddening\nwhenever those fair glimpses were his.  At last she came out to the\nveranda with Eugene and sat upon a little divan, so close to Joe that,\ndaring wildly in the shadow, he reached out a trembling hand and let\nhis fingers rest upon the end of her scarf, which had fallen from her\nshoulders and touched the floor.  She sat with her back to him, as did\nEugene.\n\n\"You have changed, I think, since last summer,\" he heard her say,\nreflectively.\n\n\"For the worse, ma cherie?\" Joe's expression might have been worth\nseeing when Eugene said \"ma cherie,\" for it was known in the Louden\nhousehold that Mr. Bantry had failed to pass his examination in the\nFrench language.\n\n\"No,\" she answered.  \"But you have seen so much and accomplished so\nmuch since then.  You have become so polished and so--\" She paused, and\nthen continued, \"But perhaps I'd better not say it; you might be\noffended.\"\n\n\"No.  I want you to say it,\" he returned, confidently, and his\nconfidence was fully justified, for she said:\n\n\"Well, then, I mean that you have become so thoroughly a man of the\nworld.  Now I've said it! You ARE offended--aren't you?\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all,\" replied Mr. Bantry, preventing by a masterful\neffort his pleasure from showing in his face.  \"Though I suppose you\nmean to imply that I'm rather wicked.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Mamie, with profound admiration, \"not exactly wicked.\"\n\n\"University life IS fast nowadays,\" Eugene admitted.  \"It's difficult\nnot to be drawn into it!\"\n\n\"And I suppose you look down on poor little Canaan now, and everybody\nin it!\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" he laughed, indulgently.  \"Not at all, not at all!  I find it\nvery amusing.\"\n\n\"All of it?\"\n\n\"Not you,\" he answered, becoming very grave.\n\n\"Honestly--DON'T you?\"  Her young voice trembled a little.\n\n\"Honestly--indeed--truly--\" Eugene leaned very close to her and the\nwords were barely audible.\n\n\"You KNOW I don't!\"\n\n\"Then I'm--glad,\" she whispered, and Joe saw his step-brother touch her\nhand, but she rose quickly. \"There's the music,\" she cried, happily.\n\"It's a waltz, and it's YOURS!\"\n\nJoe heard her little high heels tapping gayly towards the window,\nfollowed by the heavier tread of Eugene, but he did not watch them go.\n\nHe lay on his back, with the hand that had touched Mamie's scarf\npressed across his closed eyes.\n\nThe music of that waltz was of the old-fashioned swingingly sorrowful\nsort, and it would be hard to say how long it was after that before the\nboy could hear the air played without a recurrence of the bitterness of\nthat moment.  The rhythmical pathos of the violins was in such accord\nwith a faint sound of weeping which he heard near him, presently, that\nfor a little while he believed this sound to be part of the music and\npart of himself.  Then it became more distinct, and he raised himself\non one elbow to look about.\n\nVery close to him, sitting upon the divan in the shadow, was a girl\nwearing a dress of beautiful silk. She was crying softly, her face in\nher hands.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE DISASTER\n\nAriel had worked all the afternoon over her mother's wedding-gown, and\ntwo hours were required by her toilet for the dance.  She curled her\nhair frizzily, burning it here and there, with a slate-pencil heated\nover a lamp chimney, and she placed above one ear three or four large\nartificial roses, taken from an old hat of her mother's, which she had\nfound in a trunk in the store-room.  Possessing no slippers, she\ncarefully blacked and polished her shoes, which had been clumsily\nresoled, and fastened into the strings of each small rosettes of red\nribbon; after which she practised swinging the train of her skirt until\nshe was proud of her manipulation of it.  She had no powder, but found\nin her grandfather's room a lump of magnesia, that he was in the habit\nof taking for heart-burn, and passed it over and over her brown face\nand hands.  Then a lingering gaze into her small mirror gave her joy at\nlast: she yearned so hard to see herself charming that she did see\nherself so.  Admiration came and she told herself that she was more\nattractive to look at than she had ever been in her life, and that,\nperhaps, at last she might begin to be sought for like other girls.\nThe little glass showed a sort of prettiness in her thin, unmatured\nyoung face; tripping dance-tunes ran through her head, her feet keeping\nthe time,--ah, she did so hope to dance often that night!\nPerhaps--perhaps she might be asked for every number.  And so, wrapping\nan old waterproof cloak about her, she took her grandfather's arm and\nsallied forth, high hopes in her beating heart.\n\nIt was in the dressing-room that the change began to come.  Alone, at\nhome in her own ugly little room, she had thought herself almost\nbeautiful, but here in the brightly lighted chamber crowded with the\nother girls it was different.  There was a big cheval-glass at one end\nof the room, and she faced it, when her turn came--for the mirror was\npopular--with a sinking spirit.  There was the contrast, like a picture\npainted and framed.  The other girls all wore their hair after the\nfashion introduced to Canaan by Mamie Pike the week before, on her\nreturn from a visit to Chicago.  None of them had \"crimped\" and none\nhad bedecked their tresses with artificial flowers.  Her alterations of\nthe wedding-dress had not been successful; the skirt was too short in\nfront and higher on one side than on the other, showing too plainly the\nheavy-soled shoes, which had lost most of their polish in the walk\nthrough the snow.  The ribbon rosettes were fully revealed, and as she\nglanced at their reflection she heard the words, \"LOOK AT THAT TRAIN\nAND THOSE ROSETTES!\" whispered behind her, and saw in the mirror two\npretty young women turn away with their handkerchiefs over their mouths\nand retreat hurriedly to an alcove.  All the feet in the room except\nAriel's were in dainty kid or satin slippers of the color of the\ndresses from which they glimmered out, and only Ariel wore a train.\n\nShe went away from the mirror and pretended to be busy with a hanging\nthread in her sleeve.\n\nShe was singularly an alien in the chattering room, although she had\nbeen born and lived all her life in the town.  Perhaps her position\namong the young ladies may be best defined by the remark, generally\ncurrent among them, that evening, to the effect that it was \"very sweet\nof Mamie to invite her.\"  Ariel was not like the others; she was not of\nthem, and never had been.  Indeed, she did not know them very well.\nSome of them nodded to her and gave her a word of greeting pleasantly;\nall of them whispered about her with wonder and suppressed amusement;\nbut none talked to her.  They were not unkindly, but they were young\nand eager and excited over their own interests,--which were then in the\n\"gentlemen's dressing-room.\"\n\nEach of the other girls had been escorted by a youth of the place, and,\none by one, joining these escorts in the hall outside the door, they\ndescended the stairs, until only Ariel was left.  She came down alone\nafter the first dance had begun, and greeted her young hostess's mother\ntimidly.  Mrs. Pike--a small, frightened-looking woman with a prominent\nruby necklace--answered her absently, and hurried away to see that the\nimported waiters did not steal anything.\n\nAriel sat in one of the chairs against the wall and watched the dancers\nwith a smile of eager and benevolent interest.  In Canaan no parents,\nno guardians nor aunts, were haled forth o' nights to duenna the\njunketings of youth; Mrs. Pike did not reappear, and Ariel sat\nconspicuously alone; there was nothing else for her to do.  It was not\nan easy matter.\n\nWhen the first dance reached an end, Mamie Pike came to her for a\nmoment with a cheery welcome, and was immediately surrounded by a\ncircle of young men and women, flushed with dancing, shouting as was\ntheir wont, laughing inexplicably over words and phrases and\nunintelligible mono-syllables, as if they all belonged to a secret\nsociety and these cries were symbols of things exquisitely humorous,\nwhich only they understood.  Ariel laughed with them more heartily than\nany other, so that she might seem to be of them and as merry as they\nwere, but almost immediately she found herself outside of the circle,\nand presently they all whirled away into another dance, and she was\nleft alone again.\n\nSo she sat, no one coming near her, through several dances, trying to\nmaintain the smile of delighted interest upon her face, though she felt\nthe muscles of her face beginning to ache with their fixedness, her\neyes growing hot and glazed.  All the other girls were provided with\npartners for every dance, with several young men left over, these\nlatter lounging hilariously together in the doorways. Ariel was careful\nnot to glance towards them, but she could not help hating them.  Once\nor twice between the dances she saw Miss Pike speak appealingly to one\nof the superfluous, glancing, at the same time, in her own direction,\nand Ariel could see, too, that the appeal proved unsuccessful, until at\nlast Mamie approached her, leading Norbert Flitcroft, partly by the\nhand, partly by will-power. Norbert was an excessively fat boy, and at\nthe present moment looked as patient as the blind. But he asked Ariel\nif she was \"engaged for the next dance,\" and, Mamie having flitted\naway, stood disconsolately beside her, waiting for the music to begin.\nAriel was grateful for him.\n\n\"I think you must be very good-natured, Mr. Flitcroft,\" she said, with\nan air of raillery.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" he replied, plaintively.  \"Everybody thinks I am because\nI'm fat, and they expect me to do things they never dream of asking\nanybody else to do.  I'd like to see 'em even ASK 'Gene Bantry to go\nand do some of the things they get me to do!  A person isn't\ngood-natured just because he's fat,\" he concluded, morbidly, \"but he\nmight as well be!\"\n\n\"Oh, I meant good-natured,\" she returned, with a sprightly laugh,\n\"because you're willing to waltz with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he returned, sighing, \"that's all right.\"\n\nThe orchestra flourished into \"La Paloma\"; he put his arm mournfully\nabout her, and taking her right hand with his left, carried her arm out\nto a rigid right angle, beginning to pump and balance for time.  They\nmade three false starts and then got away.  Ariel danced badly; she\nhopped and lost the step, but they persevered, bumping against other\ncouples continually.  Circling breathlessly into the next room, they\npassed close to a long mirror, in which Ariel saw herself, although in\na flash, more bitterly contrasted to the others than in the\ncheval-glass of the dressing-room.  The clump of roses was flopping\nabout her neck, her crimped hair looked frowzy, and there was something\nterribly wrong about her dress.  Suddenly she felt her train to be\nominously grotesque, as a thing following her in a nightmare.\n\nA moment later she caught her partner making a burlesque face of\nsuffering over her shoulder, and, turning her head quickly, saw for\nwhose benefit he had constructed it.  Eugene Bantry, flying expertly by\nwith Mamie, was bestowing upon Mr. Flitcroft a condescendingly\ncommiserative wink. The next instant she tripped in her train and fell\nto the floor at Eugene's feet, carrying her partner with her.\n\nThere was a shout of laughter.  The young hostess stopped Eugene, who\nwould have gone on, and he had no choice but to stoop to Ariel's\nassistance.\n\n\"It seems to be a habit of mine,\" she said, laughing loudly.\n\nShe did not appear to see the hand he offered, but got to her feet\nwithout help and walked quickly away with Norbert, who proceeded to\nlive up to the character he had given himself.\n\n\"Perhaps we had better not try it again,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Well, I should think not,\" he returned, with the frankest gloom.  With\nthe air of conducting her home he took her to the chair against the\nwall whence he had brought her.  There his responsibility for her\nseemed to cease.  \"Will you excuse me?\" he asked, and there was no\ndoubt that he felt that he had been given more than his share that\nevening, even though he was fat.\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"  Her laughter was continuous. \"I should think you WOULD\nbe glad to get rid of me after that.  Ha, ha, ha!  Poor Mr. Flitcroft,\nyou know you are!\"\n\nIt was the deadly truth, and the fat one, saying, \"Well, if you'll just\nexcuse me now,\" hurried away with a step which grew lighter as the\ndistance from her increased.  Arrived at the haven of a far doorway, he\nmopped his brow and shook his head grimly in response to frequent\nrallyings.\n\nAriel sat through more dances, interminable dances and intermissions,\nin that same chair, in which, it began to seem, she was to live out the\nrest of her life.  Now and then, if she thought people were looking at\nher as they passed, she broke into a laugh and nodded slightly, as if\nstill amused over her mishap.\n\nAfter a long time she rose, and laughing cheerfully to Mr. Flitcroft,\nwho was standing in the doorway and replied with a wan smile, stepped\nout quickly into the hall, where she almost ran into her great-uncle,\nJonas Tabor.  He was going towards the big front doors with Judge Pike,\nhaving just come out of the latter's library, down the hall.\n\nJonas was breathing heavily and was shockingly pale, though his eyes\nwere very bright.  He turned his back upon his grandniece sharply and\nwent out of the door.  Ariel turned from him quite as abruptly and\nre-entered the room whence she had come. She laughed again to her fat\nfriend as she passed him, and, still laughing, went towards the fatal\nchair, when her eyes caught sight of Eugene Bantry and Mamie coming in\nthrough the window from the porch.  Still laughing, she went to the\nwindow and looked out; the porch seemed deserted and was faintly\nilluminated by a few Japanese lanterns. She sprang out, dropped upon\nthe divan, and burying her face in her hands, cried heart-brokenly.\nPresently she felt something alive touch her foot, and, her breath\ncatching with alarm, she started to rise.  A thin hand, issuing from a\nshabby sleeve, had stolen out between two of the green tubs and was\npressing upon one of her shoes.\n\n\"'SH!\" said Joe.  \"Don't make a noise!\"\n\nHis warning was not needed; she had recognized the hand and sleeve\ninstantly.  She dropped back with a low sound which would have been\nhysterical if it had been louder, while he raised himself on his arm\nuntil she could see his face dimly, as he peered at her between the\npalms.\n\n\"What were you going on about?\" he asked, angrily.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered.  \"I wasn't.  You must go away, and quick.\nIt's too dangerous.  If the Judge found you--\"\n\n\"He won't!\"\n\n\"Ah, you'd risk anything to see Mamie Pike--\"\n\n\"What were you crying about?\" he interrupted.\n\n\"Nothing, I tell you!\" she repeated, the tears not ceasing to gather in\nher eyes.  \"I wasn't.\"\n\n\"I want to know what it was,\" he insisted. \"Didn't the fools ask you to\ndance?  Ah!  You needn't tell me.  That's it.  I've been here for the\nlast three dances and you weren't in sight till you came to the window.\nWell, what do you care about that for?\"\n\n\"I don't!\" she answered.  \"I don't!\"  Then suddenly, without being able\nto prevent it, she sobbed.\n\n\"No,\" he said, gently, \"I see you don't.  And you let yourself be a\nfool because there are a lot of fools in there.\"\n\nShe gave way, all at once, to a gust of sorrow and bitterness; she bent\nfar over and caught his hand and laid it against her wet cheek.  \"Oh,\nJoe,\" she whispered, brokenly, \"I think we have such hard lives, you\nand I!  It doesn't seem right--while we're so young!  Why can't we be\nlike the others?  Why can't we have some of the fun?\"\n\nHe withdrew his hand, with the embarrassment and shame he would have\nfelt had she been a boy. \"Get out!\" he said, feebly.\n\nShe did not seem to notice, but, still stooping, rested her elbows on\nher knees and her face in her hands.  \"I try so hard to have fun, to be\nlike the rest,--and it's always a mistake, always, always, always!\"\nShe rocked herself, slightly, from side to side.  \"I am a fool, it's\nthe truth, or I wouldn't have come to-night.  I want to be\nattractive--I want to be in things.  I want to laugh like they do--\"\n\n\"To laugh just to laugh, and not because there's something funny?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, I do!  And to know how to dress and to wear my hair--there\nmust be some place where you can learn those things.  I've never had\nany one to show me!  Ah!  Grandfather said something like that this\nafternoon--poor man! We're in the same case.  If we only had some one\nto show us!  It all seems so BLIND, here in Canaan, for him and me!  I\ndon't say it's not my own fault as much as being poor.  I've been a\nhoyden; I don't feel as if I'd learned how to be a girl yet, Joe.  It's\nonly lately I've cared, but I'm seventeen, Joe, and--and\nto-day--to-day--I was sent home--and to-night--\" She faltered, came to\na stop, and her whole body was shaken with sobs. \"I hate myself so for\ncrying--for everything!\"\n\n\"I'll tell you something,\" he whispered, chuckling desperately.  \"'Gene\nmade me unpack his trunk, and I don't believe he's as great a man at\ncollege as he is here.  I opened one of his books, and some one had\nwritten in it, 'Prigamaloo Bantry, the Class Try-To-Be'!  He'd never\nnoticed, and you ought to have heard him go on!  You'd have just died,\nAriel--I almost bust wide open!  It was a mean trick in me, but I\ncouldn't help showing it to him.\"\n\nJoe's object was obtained.  She stopped crying, and, wiping her eyes,\nsmiled faintly.  Then she became grave.  \"You're jealous of Eugene,\"\nshe said.\n\nHe considered this for a moment.  \"Yes,\" he answered, thoughtfully, \"I\nam.  But I wouldn't think about him differently on that account.  And I\nwouldn't talk about him to any one but you.\"\n\n\"Not even to--\" She left the question unfinished.\n\n\"No,\" he said, quietly.  \"Of course not.\"\n\n\"No?  Because it wouldn't be any use?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I never have a chance to talk to her, anyway.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't!\"  Her voice had grown steady.  \"You say I'm a\nfool.  What are you?\"\n\n\"You needn't worry about me,\" he began.  \"I can take care--\"\n\n\"'SH!\" she whispered, warningly.  The music had stopped, a loud clatter\nof voices and laughter succeeding it.\n\n\"What need to be careful,\" Joe assured her, \"with all that noise going\non?\"\n\n\"You must go away,\" she said, anxiously.  \"Oh, please, Joe!\"\n\n\"Not yet; I want--\"\n\nShe coughed loudly.  Eugene and Mamie Pike had come to the window, with\nthe evident intention of occupying the veranda, but perceiving Ariel\nengaged with threads in her sleeve, they turned away and disappeared.\nOther couples looked out from time to time, and finding the solitary\nfigure in possession, retreated abruptly to seek stairways and remote\ncorners for the things they were impelled to say.\n\nAnd so Ariel held the porch for three dances and three intermissions,\noccupying a great part of the time with entreaties that her obdurate\nand reckless companion should go.  When, for the fourth time, the music\nsounded, her agitation had so increased that she was visibly trembling.\n\"I can't stand it, Joe,\" she said, bending over him.\n\n\"I don't know what would happen if they found you.  You've GOT to go!\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" he chuckled.  \"They haven't even distributed the\nsupper yet!\"\n\n\"And you take all the chances,\" she said, slowly, \"just to see her pass\nthat window a few times.\"\n\n\"What chances?\"\n\n\"Of what the Judge will do if any one sees you.\"\n\n\"Nothing; because if any one saw me I'd leave.\"\n\n\"Please go.\"\n\n\"Not till--\"\n\n\"'SH!\"\n\nA colored waiter, smiling graciously, came out upon the porch bearing a\ntray of salad, hot oysters, and coffee.  Ariel shook her head.\n\n\"I don't want any,\" she murmured.\n\nThe waiter turned away in pity and was re-entering the window, when a\npassionate whisper fell upon his ear as well as upon Ariel's.\n\n\"TAKE IT!\"\n\n\"Ma'am?\" said the waiter.\n\n\"I've changed my mind,\" she replied, quickly. The waiter, his elation\nrestored, gave of his viands with the superfluous bounty loved by his\nrace when distributing the product of the wealthy.\n\nWhen he had gone, \"Give me everything that's hot,\" said Joe.  \"You can\nkeep the salad.\"\n\n\"I couldn't eat it or anything else,\" she answered, thrusting the plate\nbetween the palms.\n\nFor a time there was silence.  From within the house came the\ncontinuous babble of voices and laughter, the clink of cutlery on\nchina.  The young people spent a long time over their supper. By-and-by\nthe waiter returned to the veranda, deposited a plate of colored ices\nupon Ariel's knees with a noble gesture, and departed.\n\n\"No ice for me,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Won't you please go now?\" she entreated!\n\n\"It wouldn't be good manners,\" he responded. \"They might think I only\ncame for supper--\"\n\n\"Hand me back the things.  The waiter might come for them any minute.\"\n\n\"Not yet.  I haven't quite finished.  I eat with contemplation, Ariel,\nbecause there's more than the mere food and the warmth of it to\nconsider. There's the pleasure of being entertained by the great Martin\nPike.  Think what a real kindness I'm doing him, too.  I increase his\ngood deeds and his hospitality without his knowing it or being able to\nhelp it.  Don't you see how I boost his standing with the Recording\nAngel?  If Lazarus had behaved the way I do, Dives needn't have had\nthose worries that came to him in the after-life.\"\n\n\"Give me the dish and coffee-cup,\" she whispered, impatiently.\n\"Suppose the waiter came and had to look for them?  Quick!\"\n\n\"Take them, then.  You'll see that jealousy hasn't spoiled my\nappetite--\"\n\nA bottle-shaped figure appeared in the window and she had no time to\ntake the plate and cup which were being pushed through the palm-leaves.\nShe whispered a syllable of warning, and the dishes were hurriedly\nwithdrawn as Norbert Flitcroft, wearing a solemn expression of injury,\ncame out upon the veranda.\n\nHe halted suddenly.  \"What's that?\" he asked, with suspicion.\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered Ariel, sharply.  \"Where?\"\n\n\"Behind those palms.\"\n\n\"Probably your own shadow,\" she laughed; \"or it might have been a\ndraught moving the leaves.\"\n\nHe did not seem satisfied, but stared hard at the spot where the dishes\nhad disappeared, meantime edging back cautiously nearer the window.\n\n\"They want you,\" he said, after a pause.  \"Some one's come for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, is grandfather waiting?\"  She rose, at the same time letting her\nhandkerchief fall.  She stooped to pick it up, with her face away from\nNorbert and towards the palms, whispering tremulously, but with\npassionate urgency, \"Please GO!\"\n\n\"It isn't your grandfather that has come for you,\" said the fat one,\nslowly.  \"It is old Eskew Arp.  Something's happened.\"\n\nShe looked at him for a moment, beginning to tremble violently, her\neyes growing wide with fright.\n\n\"Is my grandfather--is he sick?\"\n\n\"You better go and see.  Old Eskew's waiting in the hall.  He'll tell\nyou.\"\n\nShe was by him and through the window instantly. Norbert did not follow\nher; he remained for several moments looking earnestly at the palms;\nthen he stepped through the window and beckoned to a youth who was\nlounging in the doorway across the room.\n\n\"There's somebody hiding behind those plants,\" he whispered, when his\nfriend reached him.  \"Go and tell Judge Pike to send some of the\nniggers to watch outside the porch, so that he doesn't get away.  Then\ntell him to get his revolver and come here.\"\n\nMeanwhile Ariel had found Mr. Arp waiting in the hall, talking in a low\nvoice to Mrs. Pike.\n\n\"Your grandfather's all right,\" he told the frightened girl, quickly.\n\"He sent me for you, that's all.  Just hurry and get your things.\"\n\nShe was with him again in a moment, and seizing the old man's arm,\nhurried him down the steps and toward the street almost at a run.\n\n\"You're not telling me the truth,\" she said. \"You're not telling me the\ntruth!\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened to Roger,\" panted Mr. Arp.  \"Nothing to mind, I\nmean.  Here!  We're going this way, not that.\"  They had come to the\ngate, and as she turned to the right he pulled her round sharply to the\nleft.  \"We're not going to your house.\"\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"We're going to your uncle Jonas's.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she cried, in supreme astonishment. \"What do you want to take me\nthere for?  Don't you know that he's stopped speaking to me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, grimly, with something of the look he wore\nwhen delivering a clincher at the \"National House,\"--\"he's stopped\nspeaking to everybody.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nBEAVER BEACH\n\nThe Canaan Daily Tocsin of the following morning \"ventured the\nassertion\" upon its front page that \"the scene at the Pike Mansion was\none of unalloyed festivity, music, and mirth; a fairy bower of airy\nfigures wafting here and there to the throb of waltz-strains; a\nveritable Temple of Terpsichore, shining forth with a myriad of lights,\nwhich, together with the generous profusion of floral decorations and\nthe mingled delights afforded by Minds's orchestra of Indianapolis and\nCaterer Jones of Chicago, was in all likelihood never heretofore\nsurpassed in elegance in our city....  Only one incident,\" the Tocsin\nremarked, \"marred an otherwise perfect occasion, and out of regard for\nthe culprit's family connections, which are prominent in our social\nworld, we withhold his name.  Suffice it to say that through the\nvigilance of Mr. Norbert Flitcroft, grandson of Colonel A. A.\nFlitcroft, who proved himself a thorough Lecoq (the celebrated French\ndetective), the rascal was seized and recognized.  Mr. Flitcroft,\nhaving discovered him in hiding, had a cordon of waiters drawn up\naround his hiding-place, which was the charmingly decorated side piazza\nof the Pike Mansion, and sent for Judge Pike, who came upon the\nintruder by surprise.  He evaded the Judge's indignant grasp, but\nreceived a well-merited blow over the head from a poker which the Judge\nhad concealed about his person while pretending to approach the\nhiding-place casually. Attracted to the scene by the cries of Mr.\nFlitcroft, who, standing behind Judge Pike, accidentally received a\nblow from the same weapon, all the guests of the evening sprang to view\nthe scene, only to behold the culprit leap through a crevice between\nthe strips of canvas which enclosed the piazza. He was seized by the\ncolored coachman of the Mansion, Sam Warden, and immediately pounced\nupon by the cordon of Caterer Jones's dusky assistants from Chicago,\nwho were in ambush outside. Unfortunately, after a brief struggle he\nmanaged to trip Warden, and, the others stumbling upon the prostrate\nbody of the latter, to make his escape in the darkness.\n\n\"It is not believed by many that his intention was burglary, though\nwhat his designs were can only be left to conjecture, as he is far\nbeyond the age when boys perform such actions out of a sense of\nmischief.  He had evidently occupied his hiding-place some time, and an\nidea of his coolness may be obtained from his having procured and eaten\na full meal through an unknown source. Judge Pike is justly incensed,\nand swears that he will prosecute him on this and other charges as soon\nas he can be found.  Much sympathy is felt for the culprit's family,\nwho feel his shame most keenly, but who, though sorrowing over the\noccurrence, declare that they have put up with his derelictions long\nenough, and will do nothing to step between him and the Judge's\nrighteous indignation.\"\n\nThe Pike Mansion, \"scene of festivity, music, and mirth\" (not quite so\nunalloyed, after all, the stricken Flitcroft keeping his room for a\nweek under medical supervision), had not been the only bower of the\ndance in Canaan that evening: another Temple of Terpsichore had shone\nforth with lights, though of these there were not quite a myriad. The\nfestivities they illumined obtained no mention in the paper, nor did\nthey who trod the measures in this second temple exhibit any sense of\ninjury because of the Tocsin's omission.  Nay, they were of that class,\nshy without being bashful, exclusive yet not proud, which shuns\npublicity with a single-heartedness almost unique in our republic,\ncourting observation neither in the prosecution of their professions\nnor in the pursuit of happiness.\n\nNot quite a mile above the northernmost of the factories on the\nwater-front, there projected into the river, near the end of the\ncrescent bend above the town, a long pier, relic of steamboat days,\nrotting now, and many years fallen from its maritime uses.  About\nmidway of its length stood a huge, crazy shed, long ago utilized as a\nfreight storeroom.  This had been patched and propped, and a\ndangerous-looking veranda attached to it, over-hanging the water.\nAbove the doorway was placed a sign whereon might be read the words,\n\"Beaver Beach, Mike's Place.\"  The shore end of the pier was so ruinous\nthat passage was offered by a single row of planks, which presented an\nappearance so temporary, as well as insecure, that one might have\nguessed their office to be something in the nature of a drawbridge.\nFrom these a narrow path ran through a marsh, left by the receding\nriver, to a country road of desolate appearance.  Here there was a\nrough enclosure, or corral, with some tumble-down sheds which afforded\nshelter, on the night of Joseph Louden's disgrace, for a number of\nshaggy teams attached to those decrepit and musty vehicles known\npicturesquely and accurately as Night-Hawks.  The presence of such\nquestionable shapes in the corral indicated that the dance was on at\nBeaver Beach, Mike's Place, as surely as the short line of cabs and\nfamily carriages on upper Main Street made it known that gayety was the\norder of the night at the Pike Mansion.  But among other differences\nwas this, that at the hour when the guests of the latter were leaving,\nthose seeking the hospitalities of Beaver Beach had just begun to\narrive.\n\nBy three o'clock, however, joy at Mike's Place had become beyond\nquestion unconfined, and the tokens of it were audible for a long\ndistance in all directions.  If, however, there is no sound where no\near hears, silence rested upon the country-side until an hour later.\nThen a lonely figure came shivering from the direction of the town, not\nby the road, but slinking through the snow upon the frozen river.  It\ncame slowly, as though very tired, and cautiously, too, often turning\nits head to look behind.  Finally it reached the pier, and stopped as\nif to listen.\n\nWithin the house above, a piano of evil life was being beaten to death\nfor its sins and clamoring its last cries horribly.  The old shed\nrattled in every part with the thud of many heavy feet, and trembled\nwith the shock of noise--an incessant roar of men's voices, punctuated\nwith women's screams. Then the riot quieted somewhat; there was a\nclapping of hands, and a violin began to squeak measures intended to be\nOriental.  The next moment the listener scrambled up one of the rotting\npiles and stood upon the veranda.  A shaft of red light through a\nbroken shutter struck across the figure above the shoulders, revealing\na bloody handkerchief clumsily knotted about the head, and, beneath it,\nthe face of Joe Louden.\n\nHe went to the broken shutter and looked in. Around the blackened walls\nof the room stood a bleared mob, applausively watching, through a fog\nof smoke, the contortions of an old woman in a red calico wrapper, who\nwas dancing in the centre of the floor.  The fiddler--a rubicund person\nevidently not suffering from any great depression of spirit through the\ncircumstance of being \"out on bail,\" as he was, to Joe's intimate\nknowledge--sat astride a barrel, resting his instrument upon the foamy\ntap thereof, and playing somewhat after the manner of a 'cellist; in no\nwise incommoded by the fact that a tall man (known to a few friends as\nan expert in the porch-climbing line) was sleeping on his shoulder,\nwhile another gentleman (who had prevented many cases of typhoid by\nremoving old plumbing from houses) lay on the floor at the musician's\nfeet and endeavored to assist him by plucking the strings of the fiddle.\n\nJoe opened the door and went in.  All of the merry company (who were\nable) turned sharply toward the door as it opened; then, recognizing\nthe new-comer, turned again to watch the old woman.  One or two nearest\nthe door asked the boy, without great curiosity, what had happened to\nhis head.  He merely shook it faintly in reply, and crossed the room to\nan open hallway beyond. At the end of this he came to a frowzy bedroom,\nthe door of which stood ajar.  Seated at a deal table, and working by a\ndim lamp with a broken chimney, a close-cropped, red-bearded,\nred-haired man in his shirt-sleeves was jabbing gloomily at a column of\nfigures scrawled in a dirty ledger.  He looked up as Joe appeared in\nthe doorway, and his eyes showed a slight surprise.\n\n\"I never thought ye had the temper to git somebody to split yer head,\"\nsaid he.  \"Where'd ye collect it?\"\n\n\"Nowhere,\" Joe answered, dropping weakly on the bed.  \"It doesn't\namount to anything.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll take just a look fer myself,\" said the red-bearded man,\nrising.  \"And I've no objection to not knowin' how ye come by it.\nYe've always been the great one fer keepin' yer mysteries to yerself.\"\n\nHe unwound the handkerchief and removed it from Joe's head gently.\n\"WHEE!\" he cried, as a long gash was exposed over the forehead.  \"I\nhope ye left a mark somewhere to pay a little on the score o' this!\"\n\nJoe chuckled and dropped dizzily back upon the pillow.  \"There was\nanother who got something like it,\" he gasped, feebly; \"and, oh, Mike,\nI wish you could have heard him going on!  Perhaps you did--it was only\nthree miles from here.\"\n\n\"Nothing I'd liked better!\" said the other, bringing a basin of clear\nwater from a stand in the corner.  \"It's a beautiful thing to hear a\nman holler when he gits a grand one like ye're wearing to-night.\"\n\nHe bathed the wound gently, and hurrying from the room, returned\nimmediately with a small jug of vinegar.  Wetting a rag with this\ntender fluid, he applied it to Joe's head, speaking soothingly the\nwhile.\n\n\"Nothing in the world like a bit o' good cider vinegar to keep off the\nfesterin'.  It may seem a trifle scratchy fer the moment, but it\nassassinates the blood-p'ison.  There ye go!  It's the fine thing fer\nye, Joe--what are ye squirmin' about?\"\n\n\"I'm only enjoying it,\" the boy answered, writhing as the vinegar\nworked into the gash.  \"Don't you mind my laughing to myself.\"\n\n\"Ye're a good one, Joe!\" said the other, continuing his ministrations.\n\"I wisht, after all, ye felt like makin' me known to what's the\ntrouble. There's some of us would be glad to take it up fer ye, and--\"\n\n\"No, no; it's all right.  I was somewhere I had no business to be, and\nI got caught.\"\n\n\"Who caught ye?\"\n\n\"First, some nice white people\"--Joe smiled his distorted smile--\"and\nthen a low-down black man helped me to get away as soon as he saw who\nit was.  He's a friend of mine, and he fell down and tripped up the\npursuit.\"\n\n\"I always knew ye'd git into large trouble some day.\"  The red-bearded\nman tore a strip from an old towel and began to bandage the boy's head\nwith an accustomed hand.  \"Yer taste fer excitement has been growin' on\nye every minute of the four years I've known ye.\"\n\n\"Excitement!\" echoed Joe, painfully blinking at his friend.  \"Do you\nthink I'm hunting excitement?\"\n\n\"Be hanged to ye!\" said the red-bearded man. \"Can't I say a teasing\nword without gittin' called to order fer it?  I know ye, my boy, as\nwell as ye know yerself.  Ye're a queer one.  Ye're one of the few that\nmust know all sides of the world--and can't content themselves with\nbein' respectable! Ye haven't sunk to 'low life' because ye're low\nyourself, but ye'll never git a damned one o' the respectable to\nbelieve it.  There's a few others like ye in the wide world, and I've\nseen one or two of 'em.  I've been all over, steeple-chasin',\nsailorman, soldier, pedler, and in the PO-lice; I've pulled the Grand\nNational in Paris, and I've been handcuffed in Hong-Kong; I've seen all\nthe few kinds of women there is on earth and the many kinds of men.\nYer own kind is the one I've seen the fewest of, but I knew ye belonged\nto it the first time I laid eyes on ye!\"  He paused, then continued\nwith conviction:  \"Ye'll come to no good, either, fer yerself, yet no\none can say ye haven't the talents.  Ye've helped many of the boys out\nof a bad hole with a word of advice around the courts and the jail.\nWho knows but ye'd be a great lawyer if ye kept on?\"\n\nYoung people usually like to discuss themselves under any\nconditions--hence the rewards of palmistry,--but Joe's comment on this\nharangue was not so responsive as might have been expected. \"I've got\nseven dollars,\" he said, \"and I'll leave the clothes I've got on.  Can\nyou fix me up with something different?\"\n\n\"Aha!\" cried the red-bearded man.  \"Then ye ARE in trouble!  I thought\nit 'd come to ye some day!  Have ye been dinnymitin' Martin Pike?\"\n\n\"See what you can do,\" said Joe.  \"I want to wait here until daybreak.\"\n\n\"Lie down, then,\" interrupted the other.  \"And fergit the hullabaloo in\nthe throne-room beyond.\"\n\n\"I can easily do that\"--Joe stretched himself upon the bed,--\"I've got\nso many other things to remember.\"\n\n\"I'll have the things fer ye, and I'll let ye know I have no use fer\nseven dollars,\" returned the red-bearded man, crossly.  \"What are ye\nsniffin' fer?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of the poor fellow that got the mate to this,\" said Joe,\ntouching the bandage. \"I can't help crying when I think they may have\nused vinegar on his head, too.\"\n\n\"Git to sleep if ye can!\" exclaimed the Samaritan, as a hideous burst\nof noise came from the dance-room, where some one seemed to be breaking\na chair upon an acquaintance.  \"I'll go out and regulate the boys a\nbit.\"  He turned down the lamp, fumbled in his hip-pocket, and went to\nthe door.\n\n\"Don't forget,\" Joe called after him.\n\n\"Go to sleep,\" said the red-bearded man, his hand on the door-knob.\n\"That is, go to thinkin', fer ye won't sleep; ye're not the kind.  But\nthink easy; I'll have the things fer ye.  It's a matter of pride with\nme that I always knew ye'd come to trouble.\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\nYE'LL TAK' THE HIGH ROAD AND I'LL TAK' THE LOW ROAD\n\nThe day broke with a scream of wind out of the prairies and such\ncloudbursts of snow that Joe could see neither bank of the river as he\nmade his way down the big bend of ice. The wind struck so bitterly that\nnow and then he stopped and, panting and gasping, leaned his weight\nagainst it.  The snow on the ground was caught up and flew like sea\nspume in a hurricane; it swirled about him, joining the flakes in the\nair, so that it seemed to be snowing from the ground upward as much as\nfrom the sky downward. Fierce as it was, hard as it was to fight\nthrough, snow from the earth, snow from the sky, Joe was grateful for\nit, feeling that it veiled him, making him safer, though he trusted\nsomewhat the change of costume he had effected at Beaver Beach.  A\nrough, workman's cap was pulled down over his ears and eyebrows; a\nknitted comforter was wound about the lower part of his face; under a\nragged overcoat he wore blue overalls and rubber boots; and in one of\nhis red-mittened hands he swung a tin dinner-bucket.\n\nWhen he reached the nearest of the factories he heard the exhaust of\nits engines long before he could see the building, so blinding was the\ndrift. Here he struck inland from the river, and, skirting the edges of\nthe town, made his way by unfrequented streets and alleys, bearing in\nthe general direction of upper Main Street, to find himself at last,\nalmost exhausted, in the alley behind the Pike Mansion.  There he\npaused, leaning heavily against a board fence and gazing at the vaguely\noutlined gray plane which was all that could be made of the house\nthrough the blizzard.  He had often, very often, stood in this same\nplace at night, and there was one window (Mrs. Pike's) which he had\nguessed to be Mamie's.\n\nThe storm was so thick that he could not see this window now, but he\nlooked a long time through the thickness at that part of the gray plane\nwhere he knew it was.  Then his lips parted.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mamie,\" he said, softly. \"Goodbye, Mamie.\"\n\nHe bent his body against the wind and went on, still keeping to the\nback ways, until he came to the alley which passed behind his own home,\nwhere, however, he paused only for a moment to make a quick survey of\nthe premises.  A glance satisfied him; he ran to the next fence,\nhoisted himself wearily over it, and dropped into Roger Tabor's back\nyard.\n\nHe took shelter from the wind for a moment or two, leaning against the\nfence, breathing heavily; then he stumbled on across the obliterated\npaths of a vegetable-garden until he reached the house, and beginning\nwith the kitchen, began to make the circuit of the windows, peering\ncautiously into each as he went, ready to tap on the pane should he\ncatch a glimpse of Ariel, and prepared to run if he stumbled upon her\ngrandfather.  But the place seemed empty: he had made his reconnaisance\napparently in vain, and was on the point of going away, when he heard\nthe click of the front gate and saw Ariel coming towards him, her old\nwater-proof cloak about her head and shoulders, the patched, scant,\nfaded skirt, which he knew so well, blowing about her tumultuously.  At\nthe sound of the gate he had crouched close against the side of the\nhouse, but she saw him at once.\n\nShe stopped abruptly, and throwing the water-proof back from her head,\nlooked at him through the driven fog of snow.  One of her hands was\nstretched towards him involuntarily, and it was in that attitude that\nhe long remembered her: standing in the drift which had piled up\nagainst the gate almost knee-deep, the shabby skirt and the black\nwater-proof flapping like torn sails, one hand out-stretched like that\nof a figure in a tableau, her brown face with its thin features mottled\nwith cold and unlovely, her startled eyes fixed on him with a strange,\nwild tenderness that held something of the laughter of whole\ncompanionship in it mingling with a loyalty and championship that was\nalmost ferocious--she looked an Undine of the snow.\n\nSuddenly she ran to him, still keeping her hand out-stretched until it\ntouched his own.\n\n\"How did you know me?\" he said.\n\n\"Know you!\" was all the answer she made to that question.  \"Come into\nthe house.  I've got some coffee on the stove for you.  I've been up\nand down the street waiting for you ever since it began to get light.\"\n\n\"Your grandfather won't--\"\n\n\"He's at Uncle Jonas's; he won't be back till noon.  There's no one\nhere.\"\n\nShe led him to the front-door, where he stamped and shook himself; he\nwas snow from head to foot.\n\n\"I'm running away from the good Gomorrah,\" he said, \"but I've stopped\nto look back, and I'm a pretty white pillar.\"\n\n\"I know where you stopped to look back,\" she answered, brushing him\nheartily with her red hands.  \"You came in the alley way.  It was\nMamie's window.\"\n\nHe did not reply, and the only visible token that he had any\nconsciousness of this clairvoyance of hers was a slight lift of his\nhigher eyebrow. She wasted no time in getting him to the kitchen,\nwhere, when she had removed his overcoat, she placed him in a chair,\nunwound the comforter, and, as carefully as a nurse, lifted the cap\nfrom his injured head.  When the strip of towel was disclosed she stood\nquite still for a moment with the cap in her hand; then with a broken\nlittle cry she stooped and kissed a lock of his hair, which escaped,\ndiscolored, beneath the bandage.\n\n\"Stop that!\" he commanded, horribly embarrassed.\n\n\"Oh, Joe,\" she cried, \"I knew!  I knew it was there--but to SEE it!\nAnd it's my fault for leaving you--I HAD to go or I wouldn't have--I--\"\n\n\"Where'd you hear about it?\" he asked, shortly.\n\n\"I haven't been to bed,\" she answered.  \"Grandfather and I were up all\nnight at Uncle Jonas's, and Colonel Flitcroft came about two o'clock,\nand he told us.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you about Norbert?\"\n\n\"Yes--a great deal.\"  She poured coffee into a cup from a pot on the\nstove, brought it to him, then placing some thin slices of bread upon a\ngridiron, began to toast them over the hot coals.  \"The Colonel said\nthat Norbert thought he wouldn't get well,\" she concluded; \"and Mr. Arp\nsaid Norbert was the kind that never die, and they had quite an\nargument.\"\n\n\"What were you doing at Jonas Tabor's?\" asked Joe, drinking his coffee\nwith a brightening eye.\n\n\"We were sent for,\" she answered.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nShe toasted the bread attentively without replying, and when she\ndecided that it was brown enough, piled it on a warm plate.  This she\nbrought to him, and kneeling in front of him, her elbow on his knee,\noffered for his consideration, looking steadfastly up at his eyes.  He\nbegan to eat ravenously.\n\n\"What for?\" he repeated.  \"I didn't suppose Jonas would let you come in\nhis house.  Was he sick?\"\n\n\"Joe,\" she said, quietly, disregarding his questions---\"Joe, have you\nGOT to run away?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've got to,\" he answered.\n\n\"Would you have to go to prison if you stayed?\" She asked this with a\nbreathless tensity.\n\n\"I'm not going to beg father to help me out,\" he said, determinedly.\n\"He said he wouldn't, and he'll be spared the chance.  He won't mind\nthat; nobody will care!  Nobody!  What does anybody care what _I_ do!\"\n\n\"Now you're thinking of Mamie!\" she cried. \"I can always tell.\nWhenever you don't talk naturally you're thinking of her!\"\n\nHe poured down the last of the coffee, growing red to the tips of his\nears.  \"Ariel,\" he said, \"if I ever come back--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she interrupted.  \"Would you have to go to prison right away if\nthey caught you?\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that,\" he laughed, sadly.  \"But I'm going to clear out.\nI'm not going to take any chances.  I want to see other parts of the\nworld, other kinds of people.  I might have gone, anyhow, soon, even if\nit hadn't been for last night.  Don't you ever feel that way?\"\n\n\"You know I do,\" she said.  \"I've told you--how often!  But, Joe,\nJoe,--you haven't any MONEY!  You've got to have money to LIVE!\"\n\n\"You needn't worry about that,\" returned the master of seven dollars,\ngenially.  \"I've saved enough to take care of me for a LONG time.\"\n\n\"Joe, PLEASE!  I know it isn't so.  If you could wait just a little\nwhile--only a few weeks,--only a FEW, Joe--\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"I could let you have all you want.  It would be such a beautiful thing\nfor me, Joe.  Oh, I know how you'd feel; you wouldn't even let me give\nyou that dollar I found in the street last year; but this would be only\nlending it to you, and you could pay me back sometime--\"\n\n\"Ariel!\" he exclaimed, and, setting his empty cup upon the floor, took\nher by the shoulders and shook her till the empty plate which had held\nthe toast dropped from her hand and broke into fragments.  \"You've been\nreading the Arabian Nights!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried, vehemently.  \"Grandfather would give me anything.\nHe'll give me all the money I ask for!\"\n\n\"Money!\" said Joe.  \"Which of us is wandering? MONEY?  Roger Tabor give\nyou MONEY?\"\n\n\"Not for a while.  A great many things have to be settled first.\"\n\n\"What things?\"\n\n\"Joe,\" she asked, earnestly, \"do you think it's bad of me not to feel\nthings I OUGHT to feel?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I'm glad,\" she said, and something in the way she spoke made him\nstart with pain, remembering the same words, spoken in the same tone,\nby another voice, the night before on the veranda.  \"I'm glad, Joe,\nbecause I seemed all wrong to myself.  Uncle Jonas died last night, and\nI haven't been able to get sorry.  Perhaps it's because I've been so\nfrightened about you, but I think not, for I wasn't sorry even before\nColonel Flitcroft told me about you.\"\n\n\"Jonas Tabor dead!\" said Joe.  \"Why, I saw him on the street yesterday!\"\n\n\"Yes, and I saw him just before I came out on the porch where you were.\nHe was there in the hall; he and Judge Pike had been having a long\ntalk; they'd been in some speculations together, and it had all turned\nout well.  It's very strange, but they say now that Uncle Jonas's heart\nwas weak--he was an old man, you know, almost eighty,--and he'd been\nvery anxious about his money.  The Judge had persuaded him to risk it;\nand the shock of finding that he'd made a great deal suddenly--\"\n\n\"I've heard he'd had that same shock before,\" said Joe, \"when he sold\nout to your father.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this was different, grandfather says. He told me it was in\none of those big risky businesses that Judge Pike likes to go into.\nAnd last night it was all finished, the strain was over, and Uncle\nJonas started home.  His house is only a little way from the Pikes',\nyou know; but he dropped down in the snow at his own gate, and some\npeople who were going by saw him fall.  He was dead before grandfather\ngot there.\"\n\n\"I can't be sorry,\" said Joe, slowly.\n\n\"Neither can I.  That's the dreadful part of it! They say he hadn't\nmade a will, that though he was sharper than anybody else in the whole\nworld about any other matter of business, that was the one thing he put\noff.  And we're all the kin he had in the world, grandfather and I.\nAnd they say\"--her voice sank to a whisper of excitement--\"they say he\nwas richer than anybody knew, and that this last business with Judge\nPike, the very thing that killed him--something about grain--made him\nfive times richer than before!\"\n\nShe put her hand on the boy's arm, and he let it remain there.  Her\neyes still sought his with a tremulous appeal.\n\n\"God bless you, Ariel!\" he said.  \"It's going to be a great thing for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Yes, it is.\"  The tears came suddenly to her eyes.  \"I was\nfoolish last night, but there had been such a long time of WANTING\nthings; and now--and now grandfather and I can go--\"\n\n\"You're going, too!\" Joe chuckled.\n\n\"It's heartless, I suppose, but I've settled it! We're going--\"\n\n\"_I_ know,\" he cried.  \"You've told me a thousand times what HE'S\nsaid--ten times a thousand. You're going to Paris!\"\n\n\"Paris!  Yes, that's it.  To Paris, where he can see at last how the\ngreat ones have painted,--where the others can show him!  To Paris,\nwhere we can study together, where he can learn how to put the pictures\nhe sees upon canvas, and where I--\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Joe encouraged her.  \"I want to hear you say it.  You don't\nmean that you're going to study painting; you mean that you're going to\nlearn how to make such fellows as Eugene ask you to dance.  Go ahead\nand SAY it!\"\n\n\"Yes--to learn how to DRESS!\" she said.\n\nJoe was silent for a moment.  Then he rose and took the ragged overcoat\nfrom the back of his chair.  \"Where's that muffler?\" he asked.\n\nShe brought it from where she had placed it to dry, behind the stove.\n\n\"Joe,\" she said, huskily, \"can't you wait till--\"\n\n\"Till the estate is settled and you can coax your grandfather to--\"\n\n\"No, no!  But you could go with us.\"\n\n\"To Paris?\"\n\n\"He would take you as his secretary.\"\n\n\"Aha!\"  Joe's voice rang out gayly as he rose, refreshed by the coffee,\ntoast, and warmth she had given him.  \"You've been story-reading,\nAriel, like Eugene!  'Secretary'!\"\n\n\"Please, Joe!\"\n\n\"Where's my tin dinner-pail?\"  He found it himself upon the table where\nhe had set it down. \"I'm going to earn a dishonest living,\" he went on.\n\"I have an engagement to take a freight at a water-tank that's a friend\nof mine, half a mile south of the yards.  Thank God, I'm going to get\naway from Canaan!\"\n\n\"Wait, Joe!\" She caught at his sleeve.  \"I want you to--\"\n\nHe had swung out of the room and was already at the front-door.  She\nfollowed him closely.\n\n\"Good-bye, Ariel!\"\n\n\"No, no!  WAIT, Joe!\"\n\nHe took her right hand in his own, and gave it a manly shake.  \"It's\nall right,\" he said.\n\nHe threw open the door and stepped out, but she sought to detain him.\n\"Oh, have you GOT to go?\" she cried.\n\n\"Don't you ever worry about me.\"  He bent his head to the storm as he\nsprang down the steps, and snow-wreaths swirled between them.\n\nHe disappeared in a white whirlwind.\n\nShe stood for several minutes shivering in the doorway.  Then it came\nto her that she would not know where to write to him.  She ran down to\nthe gate and through it.  Already the blizzard had covered his\nfootprints.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nGIVE A DOG A BAD NAME\n\nThe passing of Joseph from Canaan was complete.  It was an evanishment\nfor which there was neither sackcloth nor surprise; and though there\ncame no news of him it cannot be said that Canaan did not hear of him,\nfor surely it could hear itself talk.  The death of Jonas Tabor and\nyoung Louden's crime and flight incited high doings in the \"National\nHouse\" windows; many days the sages lingered with the broken meats of\nmorals left over from the banquet of gossip.  But, after all, it is\nwith the ladies of a community that reputations finally rest, and the\nmatrons of Canaan had long ago made Joe's exceedingly uncertain.  Now\nthey made it certain.\n\nThey did not fail of assistance.  The most powerful influence in the\ntown was ponderously corroborative: Martin Pike, who stood for all that\nwas respectable and financial, who passed the plate o' Sundays, who\nheld the fortunes of the town in his left hand, who was trustee for the\nwidow and orphan,--Martin Pike, patron of all worthy charities, courted\nby ministers, feared by the wicked and idle, revered by the\ngood,--Judge Martin Pike never referred to the runaway save in the\naccents of an august doomster.  His testimony settled it.\n\nIn time the precise nature of the fugitive's sins was distorted in\nreport and grew vague; it was recalled that he had done dread things;\nhe became a tradition, a legend, and a warning to the young; a Richard\nin the bush to frighten colts.  He was preached at boys caught playing\nmarbles \"for keeps\":  \"Do you want to grow up like Joe Louden?\" The\nvery name became a darkling threat, and children of the town would have\nrun had one called suddenly, \"HERE COMES JOE LOUDEN!\"  Thus does the\nevil men do live after them, and the ill-fame of the unrighteous\nincrease when they are sped!\n\nVery little of Joseph's adventures and occupations during the time of\nhis wandering is revealed to us; he always had an unwilling memory for\npain and was not afterwards wont to speak of those years which cut the\nhard lines in his face.  The first account of him to reach Canaan came\nas directly to the windows of the \"National House\" as Mr. Arp,\nhastening thither from the station, satchel in hand, could bring it.\n\nThis was on a September morning, two years after the flight, and Eskew,\nit appears, had been to the State Fair and had beheld many things\nstrangely affirming his constant testimony that this unhappy world\nincreaseth in sin; strangest of all, his meeting with our vagrant\nscalawag of Canaan.  \"Not a BLAMEBIT of doubt about it,\" declared Eskew\nto the incredulous conclave.  \"There was that Joe, and nobody else,\nstuck up in a little box outside a tent at the Fair Grounds, and\nsellin' tickets to see the Spotted Wild Boy!\"  Yes, it was Joe Louden!\nThink you, Mr. Arp could forget that face, those crooked eyebrows?  Had\nEskew tested the recognition?  Had he spoken with the outcast?  Had he\nnot!  Ay, but with such peculiar result that the battle of words among\nthe sages began with a true onset of the regulars; for, according to\nEskew's narrative, when he had delivered grimly at the boy this charge,\n\"I know you--YOU'RE JOE LOUDEN!\" the extraordinary reply had been made\npromptly and without change of countenance:  \"POSITIVELY NO FREE SEATS!\"\n\nOn this, the house divided, one party maintaining that Joe had thus\nendeavored to evade recognition, the other (to the embitterment of Mr.\nArp) that the reply was a distinct admission of identity and at the\nsame time a refusal to grant any favors on the score of past\nacquaintanceship.\n\nGoaded by inquiries, Mr. Arp, who had little desire to recall such\nwaste of silver, admitted more than he had intended: that he had\npurchased a ticket and gone in to see the Spotted Wild Boy, halting in\nhis description of this marvel with the unsatisfactory and acrid\nstatement that the Wild Boy was \"simply SPOTTED,\"--and the stung query,\n\"I suppose you know what a spot IS, Squire?\"  When he came out of the\ntent he had narrowly examined the ticket-seller,--who seemed unaware of\nhis scrutiny, and, when not engaged with his tickets, applied himself\nto a dirty law-looking book.  It was Joseph Louden, reasserted Eskew, a\nlittle taller, a little paler, incredibly shabby and miraculously thin.\nIf there were any doubt left, his forehead was somewhat disfigured by\nthe scar of an old wound--such as might have been caused by a blunt\ninstrument in the nature of a poker.\n\n\"What's the matter with YOU?\" Mr. Arp whirled upon Uncle Joe Davey, who\nwas enjoying himself by repeating at intervals the unreasonable words,\n\"Couldn't of be'n Joe,\" without any explanation.  \"Why couldn't it?\"\nshouted Eskew. \"It was!  Do you think my eyes are as fur gone as yours?\nI saw him, I tell you!  The same ornery Joe Louden, run away and\nsellin' tickets for a side-show. He wasn't even the boss of it; the\nmanager was about the meanest-lookin' human I ever saw--and most humans\nlook mighty mean, accordin' to my way of thinkin'!  Riffraff of the\nriffraff are his friends now, same as they were here.  Weeds! and HE'S\na weed, always was and always will be! Him and his kind ain't any more\nthan jimpsons; overrun everything if you give 'em a chance.\nDevil-flowers!  They have to be hoed out and scattered--even then, like\nas not, they'll come back next year and ruin your plantin' once more.\nThat boy Joe 'll turn up here again some day; you'll see if he don't.\nHe's a seed of trouble and iniquity, and anything of that kind is sure\nto come back to Canaan!\"\n\nMr. Arp stuck to his prediction for several months; then he began to\nwaver and evade.  By the end of the second year following its first\nutterance, he had formed the habit of denying that he had ever made it\nat all, and, finally having come to believe with all his heart that the\nprophecy had been deliberately foisted upon him and put in his mouth by\nSquire Buckalew, became so sore upon the subject that even the hardiest\ndared not refer to it in his presence.\n\nEskew's story of the ticket-seller was the only news of Joe Louden that\ncame to Canaan during seven years.  Another citizen of the town\nencountered the wanderer, however, but under circumstances so\nsusceptible to misconception that, in a moment of illumination, he\ndecided to let the matter rest in a golden silence.  This was Mr.\nBantry.\n\nHaving elected an elaborate course in the Arts, at the University which\nwas of his possessions, what more natural than that Eugene should seek\nthe Metropolis for the short Easter vacation of his Senior year, in\norder that his perusal of the Masters should be uninterrupted?  But it\nwas his misfortune to find the Metropolitan Museum less interesting\nthan some intricate phases of the gayety of New York--phases very\ndifficult to understand without elaborate study and a series of\nexperiments which the discreetly selfish permit others to make for\nthem.  Briefly, Eugene found himself dancing, one night, with a young\nperson in a big hat, at the \"Straw-Cellar,\" a crowded hall, down very\ndeep in the town and not at all the place for Eugene.\n\nAcute crises are to be expected at the \"Straw-Cellar,\" and Eugene was\nthe only one present who was thoroughly surprised when that of this\nnight arrived, though all of the merrymakers were frightened when they\nperceived its extent.  There is no need to detail the catastrophe.  It\ncame suddenly, and the knife did not flash.  Sick and thinking of\nhimself, Eugene stood staring at the figure lying before him upon the\nreddening floor.  A rabble fought with the quick policemen at the\ndoors, and then the lights went out, extinguished by the proprietor,\nliving up to his reputation for always being thoughtful of his patrons.\nThe place had been a nightmare; it became a black impossibility. Eugene\nstaggered to one of the open windows, from the sill of which a man had\njust leaped.\n\n\"Don't jump,\" said a voice close to his ear. \"That fellow broke his\nleg, I think, and they caught him, anyway, as soon as he struck the\npavement.  It's a big raid.  Come this way.\"\n\nA light hand fell upon his arm and he followed its leading, blindly, to\nfind himself pushed through a narrow doorway and down a flight of\ntricky, wooden steps, at the foot of which, silhouetted against a\nstreet light, a tall policeman was on guard. He laid masterful hands on\nEugene.\n\n\"'SH, Mack!\" whispered a cautious voice from the stairway.  \"That's a\nfriend of mine and not one of those you need.  He's only a student and\nscared to death.\"\n\n\"Hurry,\" said the policeman, under his breath, twisting Eugene sharply\nby him into the street; after which he stormed vehemently:  \"On yer\nway, both of ye!  Move on up the street!  Don't be tryin' to poke yer\nheads in here!  Ye'd be more anxious to git out, once ye got in, I tell\nye!\"\n\nA sob of relief came from Bantry as he gained the next corner, the\nslight figure of his conductor at his side.  \"You'd better not go to\nplaces like the 'Straw-Cellar,'\" said the latter, gravely.  \"I'd been\nwatching you for an hour.  You were dancing with the girl who did the\ncutting.\"\n\nEugene leaned against a wall, faint, one arm across his face.  He was\ntoo ill to see, or care, who it was that had saved him.  \"I never saw\nher before,\" he babbled, incoherently, \"never, never, never!  I thought\nshe looked handsome, and asked her if she'd dance with me.  Then I saw\nshe seemed queer--and wild, and she kept guiding and pushing as we\ndanced until we were near that man--and then she--then it was all\ndone--before--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other; \"she's been threatening to do it for a long\ntime.  Jealous.  Mighty good sort of a girl, though, in lots of ways.\nOnly yesterday I talked with her and almost thought I'd calmed her out\nof it.  But you can't tell with some women.  They'll brighten up and\ntalk straight and seem sensible, one minute, and promise to behave, and\nmean it too, and the next, there they go, making a scene, cutting\nsomebody or killing themselves!  You can't count on them.  But that's\nnot to the point, exactly, I expect.  You'd better keep away from the\n'Straw-Cellar.'  If you'd been caught with the rest you'd have had a\nhard time, and they'd have found out your real name, too, because it's\npretty serious on account of your dancing with her when she did it, and\nthe Canaan papers would have got hold of it and you wouldn't be invited\nto Judge Pike's any more, Eugene.\"\n\nEugene dropped his arm from his eyes and stared into the face of his\nstep-brother.\n\n\"Joe Louden!\" he gasped.\n\n\"I'll never tell,\" said Joe.  \"You'd better keep out of all this sort.\nYou don't understand it, and you don't--you don't do it because you\ncare.\" He smiled wanly, his odd distorted smile of friendliness.  \"When\nyou go back you might tell father I'm all right.  I'm working through a\nlaw-school here--and remember me to Norbert Flitcroft,\" he finished,\nwith a chuckle.\n\nEugene covered his eyes again and groaned.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Joe assured him.  \"You're as safe as if it had never\nhappened.  And I expect\"--he went on, thoughtfully--\"I expect, maybe,\nyou'd prefer NOT to say you'd seen me, when you go back to Canaan.\nWell, that's all right.  I don't suppose father will be asking after\nme--exactly.\"\n\n\"No, he doesn't,\" said Eugene, still white and shaking.  \"Don't stand\ntalking.  I'm sick.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" returned Joe.  \"But there's one thing I would like to ask\nyou--\"\n\n\"Your father's health is perfect, I believe.\"\n\n\"It--it--it was something else,\" Joe stammered, pitifully.  \"Are they\nall--are they all--all right at--at Judge Pike's?\"\n\n\"Quite!\" Eugene replied, sharply.  \"Are you going to get me away from\nhere?  I'm sick, I tell you!\"\n\n\"This street,\" said Joe, and cheerfully led the way.\n\nFive minutes later the two had parted, and Joe leaned against a cheap\nrestaurant sign-board, drearily staring after the lamps of the gypsy\nnight-cab he had found for his step-brother.  Eugene had not offered to\nshare the vehicle with him, had not even replied to his good-night.\n\nAnd Joe himself had neglected to do something he might well have done:\nhe had not asked Eugene for news of Ariel Tabor.  It will not justify\nhim entirely to suppose that he assumed that her grandfather and she\nhad left Canaan never to return, and therefore Eugene knew nothing of\nher; no such explanation serves Joe for his neglect, for the fair truth\nis that he had not thought of her. She had been a sort of playmate,\nbefore his flight, a friend taken for granted, about whom he had\nconsciously thought little more than he thought about himself--and\neasily forgotten.  Not forgotten in the sense that she had passed out\nof his memory, but forgotten none the less; she had never had a place\nin his imaginings, and so it befell that when he no longer saw her from\nday to day, she had gone from his thoughts altogether.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nA BAD PENNY TURNS UP\n\nEugene did not inform Canaan, nor any inhabitant, of his adventure of\n\"Straw-Cellar,\" nor did any hear of his meeting with his step-brother;\nand after Mr. Arp's adventure, five years passed into the imperishable\nbefore the town heard of the wanderer again, and then it heard at first\nhand; Mr. Arp's prophecy fell true, and he took it back to his bosom\nagain, claimed it as his own the morning of its fulfilment.  Joe Louden\nhad come back to Canaan.\n\nThe elder Louden was the first to know of his prodigal's return.  He\nwas alone in the office of the wooden-butter-dish factory, of which he\nwas the superintendent, when the young man came in unannounced.  He was\nstill pale and thin; his eyebrows had the same crook, one corner of his\nmouth the same droop; he was only an inch or so taller, not enough to\nbe thought a tall man; and yet, for a few moments the father did not\nrecognize his son, but stared at him, inquiring his business. During\nthose few seconds of unrecognition, Mr. Louden was somewhat favorably\nimpressed with the stranger's appearance.\n\n\"You don't know me,\" said Joe, smiling cheerfully.  \"Perhaps I've\nchanged in seven years.\" And he held out his hand.\n\nThen Mr. Louden knew; he tilted back in his desk-chair, his mouth\nfalling open.  \"Good God!\" he said, not noticing the out-stretched\nhand.  \"Have YOU come back?\"\n\nJoe's hand fell.\n\n\"Yes, I've come back to Canaan.\"\n\nMr. Louden looked at him a long time without replying; finally he\nremarked:\n\n\"I see you've still got a scar on your forehead.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've forgotten all about that,\" said the other, twisting his hat\nin his hands.  \"Seven years wipes out a good many grievances and\nwrongs.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" Mr Louden grunted.  \"I suppose it might wipe out a good\ndeal with some people. How'd you happen to stop off at Canaan? On your\nway somewhere, I suppose.\"\n\n\"No, I've come back to stay.\"\n\nMr. Louden plainly received this as no pleasant surprise.  \"What for?\"\nhe asked, slowly.\n\n\"To practise law, father.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.  \"There ought to be an opening here for me.\nI'm a graduate of as good a law-school as there is in the country--\"\n\n\"You are!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Joe, quietly.  \"I've put myself through, working in\nthe summer--\"\n\n\"Working!\" Mr. Louden snorted.  \"Side-shows?\"\n\n\"Oh, worse than that, sometimes,\" returned his son, laughing.\n\"Anything I could get.  But I've always wanted to come back home and\nwork here.\"\n\nMr. Louden leaned forward, a hand on each knee, his brow deeply\ncorrugated.  \"Do you think you'll get much practice in Canaan?\"\n\n\"Why not?  I've had a year in a good office in New York since I left\nthe school, and I think I ought to get along all right.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Louden, briefly.  \"You do?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Don't you?\"\n\n\"Who do you think in Canaan would put a case in your hands?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't expect to get anything important at the start.  But after\na while--\"\n\n\"With your reputation?\"\n\nThe smile which had faded from Joe's lips returned to them.  \"Oh, I\nknow they thought I was a harum-scarum sort of boy,\" he answered\nlightly, \"and that it was a foolish thing to run away for nothing; but\nyou had said I mustn't come to you for help--\"\n\n\"I meant it,\" said Mr. Louden.\n\n\"But that's seven years ago, and I suppose the town's forgotten all\nabout it, and forgotten me, too.  So, you see, I can make a fresh\nstart.  That's what I came back for.\"\n\n\"You've made up your mind to stay here, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I don't believe,\" said Mr. Louden, with marked uneasiness, \"that Mrs.\nLouden would be willing to let you live with us.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Joe, gently.  \"I didn't expect it.\" He turned to the window\nand looked out, averting his face, yet scoring himself with the\ncontempt he had learned to feel for those who pity themselves. His\nfather had not even asked him to sit down.  There was a long silence,\ndisturbed only by Mr. Louden's breathing, which could be heard, heavy\nand troubled.\n\nAt last Joe turned again, smiling as before. \"Well, I won't keep you\nfrom your work,\" he said. \"I suppose you're pretty busy--\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" responded his father, promptly. \"But I'll see you again\nbefore you go.  I want to give you some advice.\"\n\n\"I'm not going,\" said Joe.  \"Not going to leave Canaan, I mean.  Where\nwill I find Eugene?\"\n\n\"At the Tocsin office; he's the assistant editor. Judge Pike bought the\nTocsin last year, and he thinks a good deal of Eugene.  Don't forget I\nsaid to come to see me again before you go.\"\n\nJoe came over to the older man and held out his hand.  \"Shake hands,\nfather,\" he said.  Mr. Louden looked at him out of small implacable\neyes, the steady hostility of which only his wife or the imperious\nMartin Pike, his employer, could quell.  He shook his head.\n\n\"I don't see any use in it,\" he answered.  \"It wouldn't mean anything.\nAll my life I've been a hard-working man and an abiding man.  Before\nyou got in trouble you never did anything you ought to; you ran with\nthe lowest people in town, and I and all your folks were ashamed of\nyou.  I don't see that we've got a call to be any different now.\"  He\nswung round to his desk emphatically, on the last word, and Joe turned\naway and went out quietly.\n\nBut it was a bright morning to which he emerged from the outer doors of\nthe factory, and he made his way towards Main Street at a lively gait.\nAs he turned the corner opposite the \"National House,\" he walked into\nMr. Eskew Arp.  The old man drew back angrily.\n\n\"Lord 'a' mercy!\" cried Joe, heartily.  \"It's Mr. Arp!  I almost ran\nyou down!\" Then, as Mr. Arp made no response, but stood stock-still in\nthe way, staring at him fiercely, \"Don't you know me, Mr. Arp?\" the\nyoung man asked.  \"I'm Joe Louden.\"\n\nEskew abruptly thrust his face close to the other's.  \"NO FREE SEATS!\"\nhe hissed, savagely; and swept across to the hotel to set his world\nafire.\n\nJoe looked after the irate, receding figure, and watched it disappear\ninto the Main Street door of the \"National House.\"  As the door closed,\nhe became aware of a mighty shadow upon the pavement, and turning,\nbeheld a fat young man, wearing upon his forehead a scar similar to his\nown, waddling by with eyes fixed upon him.\n\n\"How are you, Norbert?\" Joe began.  \"Don't you remember me?  I--\"  He\ncame to a full stop, as the fat one, thrusting out an under lip as his\nonly token of recognition, passed balefully on.\n\nJoe proceeded slowly until he came to the Tocsin building.  At the foot\nof the stairway leading up to the offices he hesitated for a few\nmoments; then he turned away and walked towards the quieter part of\nMain Street.  Most of the people he met took no notice of him, only two\nor three giving him second glances of half-cognizance, as though he\nreminded them of some one they could not place, and it was not until he\nhad come near the Pike Mansion that he saw a full recognition in the\neyes of one of the many whom he knew, and who had known him in his\nboyhood in the town.  A lady, turning a corner, looked up carelessly,\nand then half-stopped within a few feet of him, as if startled. Joe's\ncheeks went a sudden crimson; for it was the lady of his old dreams.\n\nSeven years had made Mamie Pike only prettier. She had grown into her\nyoung womanhood with an ampleness that had nothing of oversufficiency\nin it, nor anywhere a threat that some day there might be too much of\nher.  Not quite seventeen when he had last seen her, now, at\ntwenty-four, her amber hair elaborately becoming a plump and regular\nface, all of her old charm came over him once more, and it immediately\nseemed to him that he saw clearly his real reason for coming back to\nCanaan.  She had been the Rich-Little-Girl of his child days, the\ngolden princess playing in the Palace-Grounds, and in his early boyhood\n(until he had grown wicked and shabby) he had been sometimes invited to\nthe Pike Mansion for the games and ice-cream of the daughter of the\nhouse, before her dancing days began.  He had gone timidly, not daring\never to \"call\" her in \"Quaker Meeting\" or \"Post-office,\" but watching\nher reverently and surreptitiously and continually.  She had always\nseemed to him the one thing of all the world most rare, most\nmysterious, most unapproachable.  She had not offered an apparition\nless so in those days when he began to come under the suspicion of\nCanaan, when the old people began to look upon him hotly, the young\npeople coldly.  His very exclusion wove for him a glamour about her,\nand she was more than ever his moon, far, lovely, unattainable, and\nbrilliant, never to be reached by his lifted arms, but only by his\nlifted eyes.  Nor had his long absence obliterated that light;\nsomewhere in his dreams it always had place, shining, perhaps, with a\nfainter lustre as the years grew to seven, but never gone altogether.\nNow, at last, that he stood in her very presence again, it sprang to\nthe full flood of its old brilliance--and more!\n\nAs she came to her half-stop of surprise, startled, he took his courage\nin two hands, and, lifting his hat, stepped to her side.\n\n\"You--you remember me?\" he stammered.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, a little breathlessly.\n\n\"Ah, that's kind of you!\" he cried, and began to walk on with her,\nunconsciously.  \"I feel like a returned ghost wandering\nabout--invisible and unrecognized.  So few people seem to remember me!\"\n\n\"I think you are wrong.  I think you'll find everybody remembers you,\"\nshe responded, uneasily.\n\n\"No, I'm afraid not,\" he began.  \"I--\"\n\n\"I'm afraid they do!\"\n\nJoe laughed a little.  \"My father was saying something like that to me\na while ago.  He meant that they used to think me a great scapegrace\nhere. Do you mean that?\"\n\n\"I'd scarcely like to say,\" she answered, her face growing more\ntroubled; for they were close on the imperial domain.\n\n\"But it's long ago--and I really didn't do anything so outrageous, it\nseems to me.\"  He laughed again.  \"I know your father was angry with me\nonce or twice, especially the night I hid on your porch to watch\nyou--to watch you dance, I mean. But, you see, I've come back to\nrehabilitate myself, to--\"\n\nShe interrupted him.  They were not far from her gate, and she saw her\nfather standing in the yard, directing a painter who was at work on one\nof the cast-iron deer.  The Judge was apparently in good spirits,\nlaughing with the workman over some jest between them, but that did not\nlessen Mamie's nervousness.\n\n\"Mr. Louden,\" she said, in as kindly a tone as she could, \"I shall have\nto ask you not to walk with me.  My father would not like it.\"\n\nJoe stopped with a jerk.\n\n\"Why, I--I thought I'd go in and shake hands with him,--and tell him\nI--\"\n\nAstonishment that partook of terror and of awe spread itself instantly\nupon her face.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" she cried.  \"NO!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Joe, humbly.  \"Good-bye.\"\n\nHe was too late to get away with any good grace. Judge Pike had seen\nthem, and, even as Joe turned to go, rushed down to the gate, flung it\nopen, and motioned his daughter to enter.  This he did with one wide\nsweep of his arm, and, with another sweep, forbade Joe to look upon\neither moon OR sun.  It was a magnificent gesture: it excluded the\nyoung man from the street, Judge Pike's street, and from the town,\nJudge Pike's town.  It swept him from the earth, abolished him, denied\nhim the right to breathe the common air, to be seen of men; and, at\nonce a headsman's stroke and an excommunication, destroyed him, soul\nand body, thus rebuking the silly Providence that had created him, and\nrepairing Its mistake by annihilating him.  This hurling Olympian\ngesture smote the street; the rails of the car-track sprang and\nquivered with the shock; it thundered, and, amid the dumfounding uproar\nof the wrath of a god, the Will of the Canaanite Jove wrote the words\nin fiery letters upon the ether:\n\n\"CEASE TO BE!\"\n\nJoe did not go in to shake hands with Judge Pike.\n\nHe turned the next corner a moment later, and went down the quiet\nstreet which led to the house which had been his home.  He did not\nglance at that somewhat grim edifice, but passed it, his eyes averted,\nand stopped in front of the long, ramshackle cottage next door.  The\nwindows were boarded; the picket-fence dropped even to the ground in\nsome sections; the chimneys sagged and curved; the roof of the long\nporch sprinkled shingles over the unkempt yard with every wind, and\nseemed about to fall.  The place was desolate with long emptiness and\ndecay: it looked like a Haunted House; and nailed to the padlocked gate\nwas a sign, half obliterated with the winters it had fronted, \"For Sale\nor Rent.\"\n\nJoe gat him meditatively back to Main Street and to the Tocsin\nbuilding.  This time he did not hesitate, but mounted the stairs and\nknocked upon the door of the assistant editor.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Eugene.  \"YOU'VE turned up, you?\"\n\nMr. Bantry of the Tocsin was not at all the Eugene rescued from the\n\"Straw-Cellar.\"  The present gentleman was more the electric Freshman\nthan the frightened adventurer whom Joe had encountered in New York.\nIt was to be seen immediately that the assistant editor had nothing\nundaintily business-like about him, nor was there the litter on his\ndesk which one might have expected.  He had the air of a gentleman\ndilettante who amused himself slightly by spending an hour or two in\nthe room now and then.  It was the evolution to the perfect of his\nFreshman manner, and his lively apparel, though somewhat chastened by\nan older taste, might have been foretold from that which had smitten\nCanaan seven years before.  He sat not at the orderly and handsome\ndesk, but lay stretched upon a divan of green leather, smoking a cigar\nof purest ray and reading sleepily a small verse-looking book in\nmorocco.  His occupation, his general air, the furniture of the room,\nand his title (doubtless equipped with a corresponding salary) might\nhave inspired in an observant cynic the idea that here lay a pet of\nFortune, whose position had been the fruit of nepotism, or, mayhap, a\nsuccessful wooing of some daughter, wife, or widow.  Eugene looked\ncompetent for that.\n\n\"I've come back to stay, 'Gene,\" said Joe.\n\nBantry had dropped his book and raised himself on an elbow.\n\"Exceedingly interesting,\" he said. \"I suppose you'll try to find\nsomething to do.  I don't think you could get a place here; Judge Pike\nowns the Tocsin, and I greatly fear he has a prejudice against you.\"\n\n\"I expect he has,\" Joe chuckled, somewhat sadly.  \"But I don't want\nnewspaper work.  I'm going to practice law.\"\n\n\"By Jove! you have courage, my festive prodigal. VRAIMENT!\"\n\nJoe cocked his head to one side with his old look of the friendly\npuppy.  \"You always did like to talk that noveletty way, 'Gene, didn't\nyou?\" he said, impersonally.\n\nEugene's color rose.  \"Have you saved up anything to starve on?\" he\nasked, crisply.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not so badly off.  I've had a salary in an office for a year,\nand I had one pretty good day at the races--\"\n\n\"You'd better go back and have another,\" said his step-brother.  \"You\ndon't seem to comprehend your standing in Canaan.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to.\"  Joe turned to the door. \"It's funny, too--in a\nway.  Well--I won't keep you any longer.  I just stopped in to say\ngood-day--\"  He paused, faltering.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" Eugene said, briskly. \"And, by-the-way, I\nhaven't mentioned that I saw you in New York.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't suppose that you would.\"\n\n\"And you needn't say anything about it, I fancy.\"\n\n\"I don't think,\" said Joe,--\"I don't think that you need be afraid I'll\ndo that.  Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Be sure to shut the door, please; it's rather noisy with it open.\nGood-bye.\"  Eugene waved his hand and sank back upon the divan.\n\nJoe went across the street to the \"National House.\"  The sages fell as\nsilent as if he had been Martin Pike.  They had just had the pleasure\nof hearing a telephone monologue by Mr. Brown, the clerk, to which they\nlistened intently:  \"Yes.  This is Brown.  Oh--oh, it's Judge Pike?\nYes indeed, Judge, yes indeed, I hear you--ha, ha!  Of course, I\nunderstand.  Yes, Judge, I heard he was in town.  No, he hasn't been\nhere.  Not yet, that is, Judge.  Yes, I hear.  No, I won't, of course.\nCertainly not.  I will, I will.  I hear perfectly, I understand.  Yes,\nsir.  Good-bye, Judge.\"\n\nJoe had begun to write his name in the register. \"My trunk is still at\nthe station,\" he said.  \"I'll give you my check to send down for it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the clerk.  \"We have no rooms.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Joe, innocently.  \"Why, I never knew more than eight\npeople to stay here at the same time in my life.\"\n\n\"We have no rooms,\" repeated the clerk, curtly.\n\n\"Is there a convention here?\"\n\n\"We have no rooms, I say!\"\n\nJoe looked up into the condensed eyes of Mr. Brown.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"I\nsee.\"\n\nDeathly silence followed him to the door, but, as it closed behind him,\nhe heard the outbreak of the sages like a tidal wave striking a\ndump-heap of tin cans.\n\nTwo hours later he descended from an evil ark of a cab at the corral\nattached to Beaver Beach, and followed the path through the marsh to\nthe crumbling pier.  A red-bearded man was seated on a plank by the\nwater edge, fishing.\n\n\"Mike,\" said Joe, \"have you got room for me? Can you take me in for a\nfew days until I find a place in town where they'll let me stay?\"\n\nThe red-bearded man rose slowly, pushed back his hat, and stared hard\nat the wanderer; then he uttered a howl of joy and seized the other's\nhands in his and shook them wildly.\n\n\"Glory be on high!\" he shouted.  \"It's Joe Louden come back!  We never\nknew how we missed ye till ye'd gone!  Place fer ye!  Can I find it?\nThere ain't a imp o' perdition in town, includin' myself, that wouldn't\nkill me if I couldn't! Ye'll have old Maggie's room, my own aunt's; ye\nremember how she used to dance!  Ha, ha!  She's been burnin' below\nthese four years!  And we'll have the celebration of yer return this\nnight. There'll be many of 'em will come when they hear ye're back in\nCanaan!  Praise God, we'll all hope ye're goin' to stay a while!\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\"OUTER DARKNESS\"\n\nIf any echo of doubt concerning his undesirable conspicuousness sounded\nfaintly in Joe's mind, it was silenced eftsoons.  Canaan had not\nforgotten him--far from it!--so far that it began pointing him out to\nstrangers on the street the very day of his return.  His course of\naction, likewise that of his friends, permitted him little obscurity,\nand when the rumors of his finally obtaining lodging at Beaver Beach,\nand of the celebration of his installation there, were presently\nconfirmed, he stood in the lime-light indeed, as a Mephistopheles\nupsprung through the trap-door.\n\nThe welcoming festivities had not been so discreetly conducted as to\naccord with the general policy of Beaver Beach.  An unfortunate\nincident caused the arrest of one of the celebrators and the\nambulancing to the hospital of another on the homeward way, the ensuing\nproceedings in court bringing to the whole affair a publicity devoutly\nunsought for.  Mr. Happy Fear (such was the habitual name of the\nimprisoned gentleman) had to bear a great amount of harsh criticism for\ninjuring a companion within the city limits after daylight, and for\nfailing to observe that three policemen were not too distant from the\nscene of operations to engage therein.\n\n\"Happy, if ye had it in mind to harm him,\" said the red-bearded man to\nMr. Fear, upon the latter's return to society, \"why didn't ye do it out\nhere at the Beach?\"\n\n\"Because,\" returned the indiscreet, \"he didn't say what he was goin' to\nsay till we got in town.\"\n\nExtraordinary probing on the part of the prosecutor had developed at\nthe trial that the obnoxious speech had referred to the guest of the\nevening. The assaulted party, one \"Nashville\" Cory, was not of Canaan,\nbut a bit of drift-wood haply touching shore for the moment at Beaver\nBeach; and--strange is this world--he had been introduced to the\ncoterie of Mike's Place by Happy Fear himself, who had enjoyed a brief\nacquaintance with him on a day when both had chanced to travel\nincognito by the same freight.  Naturally, Happy had felt responsible\nfor the proper behavior of his protege--was, in fact, bound to enforce\nit; additionally, Happy had once been saved from a term of imprisonment\n(at a time when it would have been more than ordinarily inconvenient)\nby help and advice from Joe, and he was not one to forget. Therefore he\nwas grieved to observe that his own guest seemed to be somewhat jealous\nof the hero of the occasion and disposed to look coldly upon him.  The\nstranger, however, contented himself with innuendo (mere expressions of\nthe face and other manner of things for which one could not squarely\nlay hands upon him) until such time as he and his sponsor had come to\nMain Street in the clear dawn on their way to Happy's apartment--a\nvariable abode.  It may be that the stranger perceived what Happy did\nnot; the three bluecoats in the perspective; at all events, he now put\ninto words of simple strength the unfavorable conception he had formed\nof Joe.  The result was mediaevally immediate, and the period of Mr.\nCory's convalescence in the hospital was almost half that of his\nsponsor's detention in the county jail.\n\nIt needed nothing to finish Joe with the good people of Canaan; had it\nneeded anything, the trial of Happy Fear would have overspilled the\nnecessity.  An item of the testimony was that Joseph Louden had helped\nto carry one of the ladies present--a Miss Le Roy, who had fainted--to\nthe open air, and had jostled the stranger in passing.  After this, the\noldest woman in Canaan would not have dared to speak to Joe on the\nstreet (even if she wanted to), unless she happened to be very poor or\nvery wicked.  The Tocsin printed an adequate account (for there was \"a\nlarge public interest\"), recording in conclusion that Mr. Louden paid\nthe culprit's fine which was the largest in the power of the presiding\njudge in his mercy to bestow.  Editorially, the Tocsin leaned to the\nfacetious:  \"Mr. Louden has but recently 'returned to our midst.'  We\nfervently hope that the distinguished Happy Fear will appreciate his\npatron's superb generosity.  We say 'his patron,' but perhaps we err in\nthis.  Were it not better to figure Mr. Louden as the lady in distress,\nMr. Fear as the champion in the lists?  In the present case, however,\ncontrary to the rules of romance, the champion falls in duress and\npasses to the dungeon. We merely suggest, en passant, that some of our\nbest citizens might deem it a wonderful and beauteous thing if, in\naddition to paying the fine, Mr. Louden could serve for the loyal Happy\nhis six months in the Bastile!\"\n\n\"En passant,\" if nothing else, would have revealed to Joe, in this\nimitation of a better trick, the hand of Eugene.  And, little doubt, he\nwould have agreed with Squire Buckalew in the Squire's answer to the\neasily expected comment of Mr. Arp.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Eskew, \"I think that 'Gene Bantry is jest a leetle\nbit spiderier than he is lazy. That's the first thing he's written in\nthe Tocsin this month--one of the boys over there told me.  He wrote it\nout of spite against Joe; but he'd ought to of done better.  If his\nspite hadn't run away with what mind he's got, he'd of said that both\nJoe Louden and that tramp Fear ought to of had ten years!\"\n\n\"'Gene Bantry didn't write that out of spite,\" answered Buckalew.  \"He\nonly thought he saw a chance to be kind of funny and please Judge Pike.\nThe Judge has always thought Joe was a no-account--\"\n\n\"Ain't he right?\" cried Mr. Arp.\n\n\"_I_ don't say he ain't.\"  Squire Buckalew cast a glance at Mr. Brown,\nthe clerk, and, perceiving that he was listening, added, \"The Judge\nalways IS right!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" said Colonel Flitcroft.\n\n\"I can't stand up for Joe Louden to any extent, but I don't think he\ndone wrong,\" Buckalew went on, recovering, \"when he paid this man\nFear's fine.\"\n\n\"You don't!\" exclaimed Mr. Arp.  \"Why, haven't you got gumption enough\nto see--\"\n\n\"Look here, Eskew,\" interposed his antagonist. \"How many friends have\nyou got that hate to hear folks talk bad about you?\"\n\n\"Not a one!\"  For once Eskew's guard was down, and his consistency led\nhim to destruction. \"Not a one!  It ain't in human nature.  They're\nbound to enjoy it!\"\n\n\"Got any friends that would FIGHT for you?\"\n\nEskew walked straight into this hideous trap. \"No!  There ain't a dozen\nmen ever LIVED that had!  Caesar was a popular man, but he didn't have\na soul to help him when the crowd lit on him, and I'll bet old Mark\nAntony was mighty glad they got him out in the yard before it\nhappened,--HE wouldn't have lifted a finger without a gang behind him!\nWhy, all Peter himself could do was to cut off an ear that wasn't no\nuse to anybody. What are you tryin' to get AT?\"\n\nThe Squire had him; and paused, and stroked his chin, to make the ruin\ncomplete.  \"Then I reckon you'll have to admit,\" he murmured, \"that,\nwhile I ain't defendin' Joe Louden's character, it was kind of proper\nfor him to stand by a feller that wouldn't hear nothin' against him,\nand fought for him as soon as he DID hear it!\"\n\nEskew Arp rose from his chair and left the hotel. It was the only\nmorning in all the days of the conclave when he was the first to leave.\n\nSquire Buckalew looked after the retreating figure, total triumph\nshining brazenly from his spectacles.  \"I expect,\" he explained,\nmodestly, to the others,--\"I expect I don't think any more of Joe\nLouden than he does, and I'll be glad when Canaan sees the last of him\nfor good; but sometimes the temptation to argue with Eskew does lead me\non to kind of git the better of him.\"\n\nWhen Happy Fear had suffered--with a give-and-take simplicity of\npatience--his allotment of months in durance, and was released and sent\ninto the streets and sunshine once more, he knew that his first duty\nlay in the direction of a general apology to Joe.  But the young man\nwas no longer at Beaver Beach; the red-bearded proprietor dwelt alone\nthere, and, receiving Happy with scorn and pity, directed him to\nretrace his footsteps to the town.\n\n\"Ye must have been in the black hole of incarceration indeed, if ye\nhaven't heard that Mr. Louden has his law-office on the Square, and his\nlivin'-room behind the office.  It's in that little brick buildin'\nstraight acrost from the sheriff's door o' the jail--ye've been\nneighbors this long time!  A hard time the boy had, persuadin' any one\nto rent to him, but by payin' double the price he got a place at last.\nHe's a practisin' lawyer now, praise the Lord!  And all the boys and\ngirls of our acquaintance go to him with their troubles. Ye'll see him\nwith a murder case to try before long, as sure as ye're not worth yer\nsalt!  But I expect ye can still call him by his name of Joe, all the\nsame!\"\n\nIt was a bleak and meagre little office into which Mr. Fear ushered\nhimself to offer his amends. The cracked plaster of the walls was bare\n(save for dust); there were no shelves; the fat brown volumes, most of\nthem fairly new, were piled in regular columns upon a cheap pine table;\nthere was but one window, small-paned and shadeless; an inner door of\nthis sad chamber stood half ajar, permitting the visitor unreserved\nacquaintance with the domestic economy of the tenant; for it disclosed\na second room, smaller than the office, and dependent upon the window\nof the latter for air and light.  Behind a canvas camp-cot, dimly\nvisible in the obscurity of the inner apartment, stood a small\ngas-stove, surmounted by a stew-pan, from which projected the handle of\na big tin spoon, so that it needed no ghost from the dead to whisper\nthat Joseph Louden, attorney-at-law, did his own cooking.  Indeed, he\nlooked it!\n\nUpon the threshold of the second room reposed a small, worn,\nlight-brown scrub-brush of a dog, so cosmopolitan in ancestry that his\nspecies was almost as undeterminable as the cast-iron dogs of the Pike\nMansion.  He greeted Mr. Fear hospitably, having been so lately an\noffcast of the streets himself that his adoption had taught him to lose\nonly his old tremors, not his hopefulness.  At the same time Joe rose\nquickly from the deal table, where he had been working with one hand in\nhis hair, the other splattering ink from a bad pen.\n\n\"Good for you, Happy!\" he cried, cheerfully. \"I hoped you'd come to see\nme to-day.  I've been thinking about a job for you.\"\n\n\"What kind of a job?\" asked the visitor, as they shook hands.  \"I need\none bad enough, but you know there ain't nobody in Canaan would gimme\none, Joe.\"\n\nJoe pushed him into one of the two chairs which completed the furniture\nof his office.  \"Yes, there is.  I've got an idea--\"\n\n\"First,\" broke in Mr. Fear, fingering his shapeless hat and fixing his\neyes upon it with embarrassment,--\"first lemme say what I come here to\nsay. I--well--\"  His embarrassment increased and he paused, rubbing the\nhat between his hands.\n\n\"About this job,\" Joe began.  \"We can fix it so--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Happy.  \"You lemme go on.  I didn't mean fer to cause you no\ntrouble when I lit on that loud-mouth, 'Nashville'; I never thought\nthey'd git me, or you'd be dragged in.  But I jest couldn't stand him\nno longer.  He had me all wore out--all evening long a-hintin' and\nsniffin' and wearin' that kind of a high-smile 'cause they made so much\nfuss over you.  And then when we got clear in town he come out with it!\nSaid you was too quiet to suit HIM--said he couldn't see nothin' TO\nyou!  'Well,' I says to myself, 'jest let him go on, jest one more,' I\nsays, 'then he gits it.'  And he did.  Said you tromped on his foot on\npurpose, said he knowed it,--when the Lord-a'mightiest fool on earth\nknows you never tromped on no one! Said you was one of the po'rest\nyoung sports he ever see around a place like the Beach.  You see, he\nthought you was jest one of them fool 'Bloods' that come around raisin'\na rumpus, and didn't know you was our friend and belonged out there,\nthe same as me or Mike hisself.  'Go on,' I says to myself, 'jest one\nmore!'  'HE better go home to his mamma,' he says; 'he'll git in\ntrouble if he don't.  Somebody 'll soak him if he hangs around in MY\ncompany. _I_ don't like his WAYS.'  Then I HAD to do it.  There jest\nwasn't nothin' LEFT--but I wouldn't of done you no harm by it--\"\n\n\"You didn't do me any harm, Happy.\"\n\n\"I mean your repitation.\"\n\n\"I didn't have one--so nothing in the world could harm it.  About your\ngetting some work, now--\"\n\n\"I'll listen,\" said Happy, rather suspiciously.\n\n\"You see,\" Joe went on, growing red, \"I need a sort of janitor here--\"\n\n\"What fer?\" Mr. Fear interrupted, with some shortness.\n\n\"To look after the place.\"\n\n\"You mean these two rooms?\"\n\n\"There's a stairway, too,\" Joe put forth, quickly. \"It wouldn't be any\nsinecure, Happy.  You'd earn your money; don't be afraid of that!\"\n\nMr. Fear straightened up, his burden of embarrassment gone from him,\ntransferred to the other's shoulders.\n\n\"There always was a yellow streak in you, Joe,\" he said, firmly.\n\"You're no good as a liar except when you're jokin'.  A lot you need a\njanitor! You had no business to pay my fine; you'd ort of let me worked\nit out.  Do you think my eyes ain't good enough to see how much you\nneeded the money, most of all right now when you're tryin' to git\nstarted?  If I ever take a cent from you, I hope the hand I hold out\nfer it 'll rot off.\"\n\n\"Now don't say that, Happy.\"\n\n\"I don't want a job, nohow!\" said Mr. Fear, going to the door; \"I don't\nwant to work.  There's plenty ways fer me to git along without that.\nBut I've said what I come here to say, and I'll say one thing more.\nDon't you worry about gittin' law practice.  Mike says you're goin' to\ngit all you want--and if there ain't no other way, why, a few of us 'll\ngo out and MAKE some fer ye!\"\n\nThese prophecies and promises, over which Joe chuckled at first, with\nhis head cocked to one side, grew very soon, to his amazement, to wear\na supernatural similarity to actual fulfilment.  His friends brought\nhim their own friends, such as had sinned against the laws of Canaan,\nthose under the ban of the sheriff, those who had struck in anger,\nthose who had stolen at night, those who owed and could not pay, those\nwho lived by the dice, and to his other titles to notoriety was added\nthat of defender of the poor and wicked.  He found his hands full,\nespecially after winning his first important case--on which occasion\nCanaan thought the jury mad, and was indignant with the puzzled Judge,\nwho could not see just how it had happened.\n\nJoe did not stop at that.  He kept on winning cases, clearing the\ninnocent and lightening the burdens of the guilty; he became the most\ndangerous attorney for the defence in Canaan; his honorable brethren,\naccepting the popular view of him, held him in personal contempt but\nfeared him professionally; for he proved that he knew more law than\nthey thought existed; nor could any trick him--failing which, many\ntempers were lost, but never Joe's.  His practice was not all criminal,\nas shown by the peevish outburst of the eminent Buckalew (the Squire's\nnephew, esteemed the foremost lawyer in Canaan), \"Before long, there\nwon't be any use trying to foreclose a mortgage or collect a\nnote--unless this shyster gets himself in jail!\"\n\nThe wrath of Judge Martin Pike was august--there was a kind of\nsublimity in its immenseness--on a day when it befell that the shyster\nstood betwixt him and money.\n\nThat was a monstrous task--to stand between these two and separate\nthem, to hold back the hand of Martin Pike from what it had reached out\nto grasp.  It was in the matter of some tax-titles which the magnate\nhad acquired, and, in court, Joe treated the case with such horrifying\nsimplicity that it seemed almost credible that the great man had\ncounted upon the ignorance and besottedness of Joe's client--a\nhard-drinking, disreputable old farmer--to get his land away from him\nwithout paying for it.  Now, as every one knew such a thing to be\nludicrously impossible, it was at once noised abroad in Canaan that Joe\nhad helped to swindle Judge Pike out of a large sum of money--it was\nnotorious that the shyster could bamboozle court and jury with his\ntricks; and it was felt that Joe Louden was getting into very deep\nwaters indeed.  THIS was serious: if the young man did not LOOK OUT, he\nmight find himself in the penitentiary.\n\nThe Tocsin paragraphed him with a fine regularity after this, usually\nopening with a Walrus-and-the-Carpenter gravity:  \"The time has come\nwhen we must speak of a certain matter frankly,\" or, \"At last the time\nhas arrived when the demoralization of the bar caused by a certain\ncriminal lawyer must be dealt with as it is and without gloves.\"  Once\nwhen Joe had saved a half-witted negro from \"the extreme penalty\" for\nmurder, the Tocsin had declared, with great originality:  \"This is just\nthe kind of thing that causes mobs and justifies them. If we are to\ncontinue to permit the worst class of malefactors to escape the\nconsequences of their crimes through the unwholesome dexterities and\nthe shifty manipulations and technicalities of a certain criminal\nlawyer, the time will come when an outraged citizenry may take the\nenforcement of the law in its own hands.  Let us call a spade a spade.\nIf Canaan's streets ever echo with the tread of a mob, the fault lies\nupon the head of Joseph Louden, who has once more brought about a\nmiscarriage of justice....\"\n\nJoe did not move into a larger office; he remained in the little room\nwith its one window and its fine view of the jail; his clients were\nnearly all poor, and many of his fees quite literally nominal.  Tatters\nand rags came up the narrow stairway to his door--tatters and rags and\npitiful fineries: the bleared, the sodden, the flaunting and rouged,\nthe furtive and wary, some in rags, some in tags, and some--the\nsorriest--in velvet gowns.  With these, the distressed, the\nwrong-doers, the drunken, the dirty, and the very poor, his work lay\nand his days and nights were spent.\n\nAriel had told Roger Tabor that in time Joe might come to be what the\ntown thought him, if it gave him no other chance.  Only its dinginess\nand evil surrounded him; no respectable house was open to him; the\nbarrooms--except that of the \"National House\"--welcomed him gratefully\nand admiringly.  Once he went to church, on a pleasant morning when\nnice girls wear pretty spring dresses; it gave him a thrill of delight\nto see them, to be near clean, good people once more. Inadvertently, he\ntook a seat by his step-mother, who rose with a slight rustle of silk\nand moved to another pew; and it happened, additionally, that this was\nthe morning that the minister, fired by the Tocsin's warnings, had\nchosen to preach on the subject of Joe himself.\n\nThe outcast returned to his own kind.  No lady spoke to him upon the\nstreet.  Mamie Pike had passed him with averted eyes since her first\nmeeting with him, but the shunning and snubbing of a young man by a\npretty girl have never yet, if done in a certain way, prevented him\nfrom continuing to be in love with her.  Mamie did it in the certain\nway.  Joe did not wince, therefore it hurt all the more, for blows from\nwhich one cringes lose much of their force.\n\nThe town dog had been given a bad name, painted solid black from head\nto heel.  He was a storm centre of scandal; the entrance to his dingy\nstairway was in square view of the \"National House,\" and the result is\nimaginable.  How many of Joe's clients, especially those sorriest of\nthe velvet gowns, were conjectured to ascend his stairs for reasons\nmore convivial than legal!  Yes, he lived with his own kind, and, so\nfar as the rest of Canaan was concerned, might as well have worn the\nscarlet letter on his breast or branded on his forehead.\n\nWhen he went about the streets he was made to feel his condition by the\nelaborate avoidance, yet furtive attention, of every respectable person\nhe met; and when he came home to his small rooms and shut the door\nbehind him, he was as one who has been hissed and shamed in public and\nruns to bury his hot face in his pillow.  He petted his mongrel\nextravagantly (well he might!), and would sit with him in his rooms at\nnight, holding long converse with him, the two alone together. The dog\nwas not his only confidant.  There came to be another, a more and more\nfrequent partner to their conversations, at last a familiar spirit.\nThis third came from a brown jug which Joe kept on a shelf in his\nbedroom, a vessel too frequently replenished.  When the day's work was\ndone he shut himself up, drank alone and drank hard. Sometimes when the\njug ran low and the night was late he would go out for a walk with his\ndog, and would awake in his room the next morning not remembering where\nhe had gone or how he had come home.  Once, after such a lapse of\nmemory, he woke amazed to find himself at Beaver Beach, whither, he\nlearned from the red-bearded man, Happy Fear had brought him, having\nfound him wandering dazedly in a field near by.  These lapses grew more\nfrequent, until there occurred that which was one of the strange things\nof his life.\n\nIt was a June night, a little more than two years after his return to\nCanaan, and the Tocsin had that day announced the approaching marriage\nof Eugene Bantry and his employer's daughter.  Joe ate nothing during\nthe day, and went through his work clumsily, visiting the bedroom shelf\nat intervals. At ten in the evening he went out to have the jug\nrefilled, but from the moment he left his door and the fresh air struck\nhis face, he had no clear knowledge of what he did or of what went on\nabout him until he woke in his bed the next morning.\n\nAnd yet, whatever little part of the soul of him remained, that night,\nstill undulled, not numbed, but alive, was in some strange manner\nlifted out of its pain towards a strange delight.  His body was an\nautomaton, his mind in bondage, yet there was a still, small\nconsciousness in him which knew that in his wandering something\nincredible and unexpected was happening.  What this was he did not\nknow, could not see, though his eyes were open, could not have told\nhimself any more than a baby could tell why it laughs, but it seemed\nsomething so beautiful and wonderful that the night became a night of\nperfume, its breezes bearing the music of harps and violins, while\nnightingales sang from the maples that bordered the streets of Canaan.\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE TRYST\n\nHe woke to the light of morning amazed and full of a strange wonder\nbecause he did not know what had amazed him.  For a little while after\nhis eyes opened, he lay quite motionless; then he lifted his head\nslightly and shook it with some caution.  This had come to be custom.\nThe operation assured him of the worst; the room swam round him, and,\nwith a faint groan, he let his head fall back upon the pillow.  But he\ncould not sleep again; pain stung its way through his heart as memory\nbegan to come back to him, not of the preceding night--that was all\nblank,--but realization that the girl of whom he had dreamed so long\nwas to be married.  That his dreams had been quite hopeless was no balm\nto his hurt.\n\nA chime of bells sounded from a church steeple across the Square,\nringing out in assured righteousness, summoning the good people who\nmaintained them to come and sit beneath them or be taken to task; and\nthey fell so dismally upon Joe's ear that he bestirred himself and\nrose, to the delight of his mongrel, who leaped upon him joyfully.  An\nhour later, or thereabout, the pair emerged from the narrow stairway\nand stood for a moment, blinking in the fair sunshine, apparently\nundecided which way to go.  The church bells were silent; there was no\nbreeze; the air trembled a little with the deep pipings of the organ\nacross the Square, and, save for that, the town was very quiet.  The\npaths which crossed the Court-house yard were flecked with steady\nshadow, the strong young foliage of the maples not moving, having the\nair of observing the Sabbath with propriety.  There were benches here\nand there along the walks, and to one of these Joe crossed, and sat\ndown.  The mongrel, at his master's feet, rolled on his back in morning\necstasy, ceased abruptly to roll and began to scratch his ear with a\nhind foot intently.  A tiny hand stretched to pat his head, and the dog\nlicked it appreciatively.  It belonged to a hard-washed young lady of\nsix (in starchy, white frills and new, pink ribbons), who had run ahead\nof her mother, a belated church-goer; and the mongrel charmed her.\n\n\"Will you give me this dog?\" she asked, without any tedious formalities.\n\nInvoluntarily, she departed before receiving a reply.  The mother, a\nred-faced matron whom Joe recognized as a sister of Mrs. Louden's,\nconsequently his step-aunt, swooped at the child with a rush and rustle\nof silk, and bore her on violently to her duty.  When they had gone a\nlittle way the matron's voice was heard in sharp reproof; the child,\nheld by one wrist and hurried along on tiptoe, staring back over one\nshoulder at Joe, her eyes wide, and her mouth the shape of the \"O\" she\nwas ejaculating.\n\nThe dog looked up with wistful inquiry at his master, who cocked an\neyebrow at him in return, wearing much the same expression.  The mother\nand child disappeared within the church doors and left the Square to\nthe two.  Even the hotel showed no signs of life, for the wise men were\nnot allowed to foregather on Sundays.  The organ had ceased to stir the\nair and all was in quiet, yet a quiet which, for Louden, was not peace.\nHe looked at his watch and, without intending it, spoke the hour aloud:\n\"A quarter past eleven.\"  The sound of his own voice gave him a little\nshock; he rose without knowing why, and, as he did so, it seemed to him\nthat he heard close to his ear another voice, a woman's, troubled and\ninsistent, but clear and sweet, saying:\n\n\"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!\"\n\nIt was so distinct that he started and looked round.  Then he laughed.\n\"I'll be seeing circus parades next!\"  His laughter fled, for, louder\nthan the ringing in his ears, unmistakably came the strains of a\nfar-away brass band which had no existence on land or sea or in the\nwaters under the earth.\n\n\"Here!\" he said to the mongrel.  \"We need a walk, I think.  Let's you\nand me move on before the camels turn the corner!\"\n\nThe music followed him to the street, where he turned westward toward\nthe river, and presently, as he walked on, fanning himself with his\nstraw hat, it faded and was gone.  But the voice he had heard returned.\n\n\"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!\" it said again, close to\nhis ear.\n\nThis time he did not start.  \"All right,\" he answered, wiping his\nforehead; \"if you'll let me alone, I'll be there.\"\n\nAt a dingy saloon corner, near the river, a shabby little man greeted\nhim heartily and petted the mongrel.  \"I'm mighty glad you didn't go,\nafter all, Joe,\" he added, with a brightening face.\n\n\"Go where, Happy?\"\n\nMr. Fear looked grave.  \"Don't you rec'lect meetin' me last night?\"\n\nLouden shook his head.  \"No.  Did I?\"\n\nThe other's jaw fell and his brow corrugated with self-reproach.\n\"Well, if that don't show what a thick-head I am!  I thought ye was all\nright er I'd gone on with ye.  Nobody c'd 'a' walked straighter ner\ntalked straighter.  Said ye was goin' to leave Canaan fer good and\ndidn't want nobody to know it. Said ye was goin' to take the\n'leven-o'clock through train fer the West, and told me I couldn't come\nto the deepo with ye.  Said ye'd had enough o' Canaan, and of\neverything!  I follered ye part way to the deepo, but ye turned and\nmade a motion fer me to go back, and I done it, because ye seemed to be\nkind of in trouble, and I thought ye'd ruther be by yerself.  Well,\nsir, it's one on me!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Joe.  \"I was all right.\"\n\n\"Was ye?\" returned the other.  \"DO remember, do ye?\"\n\n\"Almost,\" Joe smiled, faintly.\n\n\"ALMOST,\" echoed Happy, shaking his head seriously. \"I tell ye, Joe, ef\nI was YOU--\" he began slowly, then paused and shook his head again.  He\nseemed on the point of delivering some advice, but evidently perceiving\nthe snobbishness of such a proceeding, or else convinced by his own\nexperience of the futility of it, he swerved to cheerfulness:\n\n\"I hear the boys is all goin' to work hard fer the primaries.  Mike\nsays ye got some chances ye don't know about; HE swears ye'll be the\nnext Mayor of Canaan.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Folly and nonsense, Happy!  That's the kind of thing I used\nto think when I was a boy. But now--pshaw!\"  Joe broke off with a tired\nlaugh.  \"Tell them not to waste their time.  Are you going out to the\nBeach this afternoon?\"\n\nThe little man lowered his eyes moodily.  \"I'll be near there,\" he\nsaid, scraping his patched shoe up and down the curbstone.  \"That\nfeller's in town agin.\"\n\n\"What fellow?\"\n\n\"'Nashville' they call him; Ed's the name he give the hospital:\nCory--him that I soaked the night you come back to Canaan.  He's after\nClaudine to git his evens with me.  He's made a raise somewheres, and\nplays the spender.  And her--well, I reckon she's tired waitin' table\nat the National House; tired o' me, too.  I got a hint that they're\ngoin' out to the Beach together this afternoon.\"\n\nJoe passed his hand wearily over his aching forehead. \"I understand,\"\nhe said, \"and you'd better try to.  Cory's laying for you, of course.\nYou say he's after your wife?  He must have set about it pretty openly\nif they're going to the Beach to-day, for there is always a crowd there\non Sundays.  Is it hard for you to see why he's doing it?  It's because\nhe wants to make you jealous.  What for? So that you'll tackle him\nagain.  And why does he want that?  Because he's ready for you!\"\n\nThe other's eyes suddenly became bloodshot, his nostrils expanding\nincredibly.  \"READY, is he?  He BETTER be ready.  I--\"\n\n\"That's enough!\" Joe interrupted, swiftly. \"We'll have no talk like\nthat.  I'll settle this for you, myself.  You send word to Claudine\nthat I want to see her at my office to-morrow morning, and you--you\nstay away from the Beach to-day. Give me your word.\"\n\nMr. Fear's expression softened.  \"All right, Joe,\" he said.  \"I'll do\nwhatever you tell me to.  Any of us 'll do that; we sure know who's our\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Keep out of trouble, Happy.\"  Joe turned to go and they shook hands.\n\"Good day, and--keep out of trouble!\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Mr. Fear's countenance again gloomed ominously, and,\nshaking his head, he ruminatively entered an adjacent bar through the\nalley door.\n\nThe Main Street bridge was an old-fashioned, wooden, covered one,\ndust-colored and very narrow, squarely framing the fair, open country\nbeyond; for the town had never crossed the river. Joe found the cool\nshadow in the bridge gracious to his hot brow, and through the slender\nchinks of the worn flooring he caught bright glimpses of running water.\nWhen he came out of the other end he felt enough refreshed to light a\ncigar.\n\n\"Well, here I am,\" he said.  \"Across Main Street bridge--and it must be\ngetting on toward noon!\"  He spoke almost with the aspect of daring,\nand immediately stood still, listening. \"'REMEMBER,\"' he ventured to\nrepeat, again daring, \"'REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!'\"\nAnd again he listened.  Then he chuckled faintly with relief, for the\nvoice did not return.  \"Thank God, I've got rid of that!\" he whispered.\n\"And of the circus band too!\"\n\nA dust road turned to the right, following the river and shaded by big\nsycamores on the bank; the mongrel, intensely preoccupied with this\nroad, scampered away, his nose to the ground.  \"Good enough,\" said the\nmaster.  \"Lead on and I'll come after you.\"\n\nBut he had not far to follow.  The chase led him to a half-hollow log\nwhich lay on a low, grass-grown levee above the stream, where the dog's\ninterest in the pursuit became vivid; temporarily, however, for after a\nfew minutes of agitated investigation, he was seized with indifference\nto the whole world; panted briefly; slept.  Joe sat upon the log, which\nwas in the shade, and smoked.\n\n\"'REMEMBER!'\"  He tried it once more.  \"'ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT\nNOON!'\"  Safety still; the voice came not.  But the sound of his own\nrepetition of the words brought him an eerie tremor; for the mist of a\nmemory came with it; nothing tangible, nothing definite, but something\nvery far away and shadowy, yet just poignant enough to give him a queer\nfeeling that he was really keeping an appointment here.  Was it with\nsome water-sprite that would rise from the river?  Was it with a dryad\nof the sycamores?  He knew too well that he might expect strange\nfancies to get hold of him this morning, and, as this one grew\nuncannily stronger, he moved his head briskly as if to shake it off.\nThe result surprised him; the fancy remained, but his headache and\ndizziness had left him.\n\nA breeze wandered up the river and touched the leaves and grass to\nlife.  Sparrows hopped and chirped in the branches, absurdly surprised;\nwithout doubt having concluded in the Sunday stillness that the world\nwould drowse forever; and the mongrel lifted his head, blinked at them,\nhopelessly wishing they would alight near him, scratched his ear with\nthe manner of one who has neglected such matters overlong; reversed his\nposition; slept again.  The young corn, deep green in the bottomland,\nmoved with a staccato flurry, and the dust ghost of a mad whirling\ndervish sped up the main road to vanish at the bridge in a climax of\nlunacy. The stirring air brought a smell of blossoms; the distance took\non faint lavender hazes which blended the outlines of the fields, lying\nlike square coverlets upon the long slope of rising ground beyond the\nbottom-land, and empurpled the blue woodland shadows of the groves.\n\nFor the first time, it struck Joe that it was a beautiful day, and it\ncame to him that a beautiful day was a thing which nothing except\ndeath, sickness, or imprisonment could take from him--not even the ban\nof Canaan!  Unforewarned, music sounded in his ears again; but he did\nnot shrink from it now; this was not the circus band he had heard as he\nleft the Square, but a melody like a far-away serenade at night, as of\n\"the horns of elf-land faintly blowing\"; and he closed his eyes with\nthe sweetness of it.\n\n\"Go ahead!\" he whispered.  \"Do that all you want to.  If you'll keep it\nup like this awhile, I'll follow with 'Little Brown Jug, How I Love\nThee!' It seems to pay, after all!\"\n\nThe welcome strains, however, were but the prelude to a harsher sound\nwhich interrupted and annihilated them: the Court-house bell clanging\nout twelve.  \"All right,\" said Joe.  \"It's noon and I'm 'across Main\nStreet bridge.'\"\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked about him whimsically.  Then he shook his\nhead again.\n\nA lady had just emerged from the bridge and was coming toward him.\n\nIt would be hard to get at Joe's first impressions of her.  We can find\nconveyance for only the broadest and heaviest.  Ancient and modern\ninstances multiply the case of the sleeper who dreams out a long story\nin accurate color and fine detail, a tale of years, in the opening and\nshutting of a door.  So with Joseph, in the brief space of the lady's\napproach.  And with him, as with the sleeper, it must have been--in\nfact it was, in his recollections, later--a blur of emotion.\n\nAt first sight of her, perhaps it was pre-eminently the shock of seeing\nanything so exquisite where he had expected to see nothing at all.  For\nshe was exquisite--horrid as have been the uses of the word, its best\nand truest belong to her; she was that and much more, from the ivory\nferrule of the parasol she carried, to the light and slender footprint\nshe left in the dust of the road.  Joe knew at once that nothing like\nher had ever before been seen in Canaan.\n\nHe had little knowledge of the millinery arts, and he needed none to\nsee the harmony--harmony like that of the day he had discovered a\nlittle while ago.  Her dress and hat and gloves and parasol showed a\npale lavender overtint like that which he had seen overspreading the\nwestern slope.  (Afterward, he discovered that the gloves she wore that\nday were gray, and that her hat was for the most part white.)  The\ncharm of fabric and tint belonging to what she wore was no shame to\nher, not being of primal importance beyond herself; it was but the\nexpression of her daintiness and the adjunct of it.  She was tall, but\nif Joe could have spoken or thought of her as \"slender,\" he would have\nbeen capable of calling her lips \"red,\" in which case he would not have\nbeen Joe, and would have been as far from the truth as her lips were\nfrom red, or as her supreme delicateness was from mere slenderness.\n\nUnder the summer hat her very dark hair swept back over her temples\nwith something near trimness in the extent to which it was withheld\nfrom being fluffy.  It may be that this approach to trimness, which\nwas, after all, only a sort of coquetry with trimness, is the true key\nto the mystery of the vision of the lady who appeared to Joe. Let us\nsay that she suppressed everything that went beyond grace; that the\nhint of floridity was abhorrent to her.  \"Trim\" is as clumsy as\n\"slender\"; she had escaped from the trimness of girlhood as wholly as\nshe had gone through its coltishness.  \"Exquisite.\"  Let us go back to\nJoe's own blurred first thought of her and be content with that!\n\nShe was to pass him--so he thought--and as she drew nearer, his breath\ncame faster.\n\n\"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN STREET BRIDGE AT NOON!\" Was THIS the fay of\nwhom the voice had warned him?  With that, there befell him the mystery\nof last night.  He did not remember, but it was as if he lived again,\ndimly, the highest hour of happiness in a life a thousand years ago;\nperfume and music, roses, nightingales and plucked harp-strings.  Yes;\nsomething wonderful was happening to him.\n\nShe had stopped directly in front of him; stopped and stood looking at\nhim with her clear eyes. He did not lift his own to hers; he had long\nexperience of the averted gaze of women; but it was not only that; a\ngreat shyness beset him.  He had risen and removed his hat, trying\n(ineffectually) not to clear his throat; his every-day sense urging\nupon him that she was a stranger in Canaan who had lost her way--the\npreposterousness of any one's losing the way in Canaan not just now\nappealing to his every--day sense.\n\n\"Can I--can I--\" he stammered, blushing miserably, meaning to finish\nwith \"direct you,\" or \"show you the way.\"\n\nThen he looked at her again and saw what seemed to him the strangest\nsight of his life.  The lady's eyes had filled with tears--filled and\noverfilled.  \"I'll sit here on the log with you,\" she said.  And her\nvoice was the voice which he had heard saying, \"REMEMBER!  ACROSS MAIN\nSTREET BRIDGE AT NOON!\"\n\n\"WHAT!\" he gasped.\n\n\"You don't need to dust it!\" she went on, tremulously.  And even then\nhe did not know who she was.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nWHEN HALF-GODS GO\n\nThere was a silence, for if the dazzled young man could have spoken at\nall, He could have found nothing to say; and, perhaps, the lady would\nnot trust her own voice just then.  His eyes had fallen again; he was\ntoo dazed, and, in truth, too panic-stricken, now, to look at her,\nthough if he had been quite sure that she was part of a wonderful dream\nhe might have dared.  She was seated beside him, and had handed him her\nparasol in a little way which seemed to imply that of course he had\nreached for it, so that it was to be seen how used she was to have all\ntiny things done for her, though this was not then of his tremulous\nobserving.  He did perceive, however, that he was to furl the dainty\nthing; he pressed the catch, and let down the top timidly, as if\nfearing to break or tear it; and, as it closed, held near his face, he\ncaught a very faint, sweet, spicy emanation from it like wild roses and\ncinnamon.\n\nHe did not know her; but his timidity and a strange little choke in his\nthroat, the sudden fright which had seized upon him, were not caused by\nembarrassment.  He had no thought that she was one he had known but\ncould not, for the moment, recall; there was nothing of the awkwardness\nof that; no, he was overpowered by the miracle of this meeting.  And\nyet, white with marvelling, he felt it to be so much more touchingly a\ngreat happiness than he had ever known that at first it was\ninexpressibly sad.\n\nAt last he heard her voice again, shaking a little, as she said:\n\n\"I am glad you remembered.\"\n\n\"Remembered what?\" he faltered.\n\n\"Then you don't?\" she cried.  \"And yet you came.\"\n\n\"Came here, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes--now, at noon.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he half whispered, unable to speak aloud. \"Was it you who\nsaid--who said, 'Remember! Across--across--\"'\n\n\"'Across Main Street bridge at noon!'\" she finished for him, gently.\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath in the wonder of it. \"Where was it you said\nthat?\" he asked, slowly. \"Was it last night?\"\n\n\"Don't you even know that you came to meet me?\"\n\n\"_I_--came to--to meet--you!\"\n\nShe gave a little pitying cry, very near a sob, seeing his utter\nbewilderment.\n\n\"It was like the strangest dream in the world,\" she said.  \"You were at\nthe station when I came, last night.  You don't remember at all?\"\n\nHis eyes downcast, his face burning hotly, he could only shake his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" she continued.  \"I thought no one would be there, for I had not\nwritten to say what train I should take, but when I stepped down from\nthe platform, you were standing there; though you didn't see me at\nfirst, not until I had called your name and ran to you.  You said,\n'I've come to meet you,' but you said it queerly, I thought.  And then\nyou called a carriage for me; but you seemed so strange you couldn't\ntell how you knew that I was coming, and--and then I--I understood you\nweren't yourself.  You were very quiet, but I knew, I knew!  So I made\nyou get into the carriage--and--and--\"\n\nShe faltered to a stop, and with that, shame itself brought him\ncourage; he turned and faced her.  She had lifted her handkerchief to\nher eyes, but at his movement she dropped it, and it was not so much\nthe delicate loveliness of her face that he saw then as the tears upon\nher cheeks.\n\n\"Ah, poor boy!\" she cried.  \"I knew!  I knew!\"\n\n\"You--you took me home?\"\n\n\"You told me where you lived,\" she answered. \"Yes, I took you home.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he stammered, huskily. \"I don't understand!\"\n\nShe leaned toward him slightly, looking at him with great intentness.\n\n\"You didn't know me last night,\" she said.  \"Do you know me now?\"\n\nFor answer he could only stare at her, dumfounded.  He lifted an\nunsteady hand toward her appealingly.  But the manner of the lady, as\nshe saw the truth, underwent an April change. She drew back lightly; he\nwas favored with the most delicious, low laugh he had ever heard, and,\nby some magic whisk which she accomplished, there was no sign of tears\nabout her.\n\n\"Ah! I'm glad you're the same, Joe!\" she said. \"You never would or\ncould pretend very well. I'm glad you're the same, and I'm glad I've\nchanged, though that isn't why you have forgotten me.  You've forgotten\nme because you never thought of me.  Perhaps I should not have known\nyou if you had changed a great deal--as I have!\"\n\nHe started, leaning back from her.\n\n\"Ah!\" she laughed.  \"That's it!  That funny little twist of the head\nyou always had, like a--like a--well, you know I must have told you a\nthousand times that it was like a nice friendly puppy; so why shouldn't\nI say so now?  And your eyebrows!  When you look like that, nobody\ncould ever forget you, Joe!\"\n\nHe rose from the log, and the mongrel leaped upon him uproariously,\nthinking they were to go home, belike to food.\n\nThe lady laughed again.  \"Don't let him spoil my parasol.  And I must\nwarn you now:  Never, never TREAD ON MY SKIRT!  I'm very irritable\nabout such things!\"\n\nHe had taken three or four uncertain backward steps from her.  She sat\nbefore him, radiant with laughter, the loveliest creature he had ever\nseen; but between him and this charming vision there swept, through the\nwarm, scented June air, a veil of snow like a driven fog, and, half\nobscured in the heart of it, a young girl stood, knee-deep in a drift\npiled against an old picket gate, her black water-proof and shabby\nskirt flapping in the blizzard like torn sails, one of her hands\nout-stretched toward him, her startled eyes fixed on his.\n\n\"And, oh, how like you,\" said the lady; \"how like you and nobody else\nin the world, Joe, to have a yellow dog!\"\n\n\"ARIEL TABOR!\"\n\nHis lips formed the words without sound.\n\n\"Isn't it about time?\" she said.  \"Are strange ladies in the HABIT of\ndescending from trains to take you home?\"\n\n\nOnce, upon a white morning long ago, the sensational progress of a\ncertain youth up Main Street had stirred Canaan.  But that day was as\nnothing to this.  Mr. Bantry had left temporary paralysis in his wake;\nbut in the case of the two young people who passed slowly along the\nstreet to-day it was petrifaction, which seemingly threatened in\nseveral instances (most notably that of Mr. Arp) to become permanent.\n\nThe lower portion of the street, lined with three and four story\nbuildings of brick and stone, rather grim and hot facades under the\nmid-day sun, afforded little shade to the church-comers, who were\nworking homeward in processional little groups and clumps, none walking\nfast, though none with the appearance of great leisure, since neither\nrate of progress would have been esteemed befitting the day.  The\ngrowth of Canaan, steady, though never startling, had left almost all\nof the churches down-town, and Main Street the principal avenue of\ncommunication between them and the \"residence section.\"  So, to-day,\nthe intermittent procession stretched along the new cement side-walks\nfrom a little below the Square to Upper Main Street, where maples lined\nthe thoroughfare and the mansions of the affluent stood among pleasant\nlawns and shrubberies.  It was late; for this had been a communion\nSunday, and those far in advance, who had already reached the pretty\nand shady part of the street, were members of the churches where\nservices had been shortest; though few in the long parade looked as if\nthey had been attending anything very short, and many heads of families\nwere crisp in their replies to the theological inquiries of their\noffspring.  The men imparted largely a gloom to the itinerant\nconcourse, most of them wearing hot, long black coats and having wilted\ntheir collars; the ladies relieving this gloom somewhat by the lighter\ntints of their garments; the spick-and-span little girls relieving it\ngreatly by their white dresses and their faces, the latter bright with\nthe hope of Sunday ice-cream; while the boys, experiencing some solace\nin that they were finally out where a person could at least scratch\nhimself if he had to, yet oppressed by the decorous necessities of the\nday, marched along, furtively planning, behind imperturbably secretive\ncountenances, various means for the later dispersal of an odious\nmonotony.\n\nUsually the conversation of this long string of the homeward-bound was\nnot too frivolous or worldly; nay, it properly inclined to discussion\nof the sermon; that is, praise of the sermon, with here and there a\nmild \"I-didn't-like-his-saying\" or so; and its lighter aspects were apt\nto concern the next \"Social,\" or various pleasurable schemes for the\nraising of funds to help the heathen, the quite worthy poor, or the\nchurch.\n\nThis was the serious and seemly parade, the propriety of whose behavior\nwas to-day almost disintegrated when the lady of the bridge walked up\nthe street in the shadow of a lacy, lavender parasol carried by Joseph\nLouden.  The congregation of the church across the Square, that to\nwhich Joe's step-aunt had been late, was just debouching, almost in\nmass, upon Main Street, when these two went by.  It is not quite the\ntruth to say that all except the children came to a dead halt, but it\nis not very far from it.  The air was thick with subdued exclamations\nand whisperings.\n\nHere is no mystery.  Joe was probably the only person of respectable\nderivation in Canaan who had not known for weeks that Ariel Tabor was\non her way home.  And the news that she had arrived the night before\nhad been widely disseminated on the way to church, entering church, IN\nchurch (even so!), and coming out of church.  An account of her house\nin the Avenue Henri Martin, and of her portrait in the Salon--a\nmysterious business to many, and not lacking in grandeur for that!--had\noccupied two columns in the Tocsin, on a day, some months before, when\nJoe had found himself inimically head-lined on the first page, and had\ndropped the paper without reading further.  Ariel's name had been in\nthe mouth of Canaan for a long time; unfortunately for Joe, however,\nnot in the mouth of that Canaan which held converse with him.\n\nJoe had not known her.  The women recognized her, infallibly, at first\nglance; even those who had quite forgotten her.  And the women told\ntheir men.  Hence the un-Sunday-like demeanor of the procession, for\nfew towns hold it more unseemly to stand and stare at passers-by,\nespecially on the Sabbath.--BUT Ariel Tabor returned--and walking\nwith--WITH JOE LOUDEN! ...\n\nA low but increasing murmur followed the two as they proceeded.  It ran\nup the street ahead of them; people turned to look back and paused, so\nthat they had to walk round one or two groups. They had, also, to walk\nround Norbert Flitcroft, which was very like walking round a group.  He\nwas one of the few (he was waddling home alone) who did not identify\nMiss Tabor, and her effect upon him was extraordinary.  His mouth\nopened and he gazed stodgily, his widening eyes like sun-dogs coming\nout of a fog.  He did not recognize her escort; did not see him at all\nuntil they had passed, after which Mr. Flitcroft experienced a few\nmoments of trance; came out of it stricken through and through; felt\nnervously of his tie; resolutely fell in behind the heeling mongrel and\nfollowed, at a distance of some forty paces, determined to learn what\nhousehold this heavenly visitor honored, and thrilling with the\nintention to please that same household with his own presence as soon\nand as often as possible.\n\nAriel flushed a little when she perceived the extent of their\nconspicuousness; but it was not the blush that Joe remembered had\nreddened the tanned skin of old; for her brownness had gone long ago,\nthough it had not left her merely pink and white.  This was a delicate\nrosiness rising from her cheeks to her temples as the earliest dawn\nrises.  If there had been many words left in Joe, he would have called\nit a divine blush; it fascinated him, and if anything could have\ndeepened the glamour about her, it would have been this blush.  He did\nnot understand it, but when he saw it he stumbled.\n\nThose who gaped and stared were for him only blurs in the background;\ntruly, he saw \"men as trees walking\"; and when it became necessary to\nstep out to the curb in passing some clump of people, it was to him as\nif Ariel and he, enchantedly alone, were working their way through\nunderbrush in the woods.\n\nHe kept trying to realize that this lady of wonder was Ariel Tabor, but\nhe could not; he could not connect the shabby Ariel, whom he had\ntreated as one boy treats another, with this young woman of the world.\nHe had always been embarrassed, himself, and ashamed of her, when\nanything she did made him remember that, after all, she was a girl; as,\non the day he ran away, when she kissed a lock of his hair escaping\nfrom the bandage.  With that recollection, even his ears grew red: it\ndid not seem probable that it would ever happen again!  The next\ninstant he heard himself calling her \"Miss Tabor.\"\n\nAt this she seemed amused.  \"You ought to have called me that, years\nago,\" she said, \"for all you knew me!\"\n\n\"I did know her--YOU, I mean!\" he answered. \"I used to know nearly\neverything you were going to say before you said it.  It seems strange\nnow--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted.  \"It does seem strange now!\"\n\n\"Somehow,\" he went on, \"I doubt if now I'd know.\"\n\n\"Somehow,\" she echoed, with fine gravity, \"I doubt it, too.\"\n\nAlthough he had so dim a perception of the staring and whispering which\ngreeted and followed them, Ariel, of course, was thoroughly aware of\nit, though the only sign she gave was the slight blush, which very soon\ndisappeared.  That people turned to look at her may have been not\naltogether a novelty: a girl who had learned to appear unconscious of\nthe Continental stare, the following gaze of the boulevards, the frank\nglasses of the Costanza in Rome, was not ill equipped to face Main\nStreet, Canaan, even as it was to-day.\n\nUnder the sycamores, before they started, they had not talked a great\ndeal; there had been long silences: almost all her questions concerning\nthe period of his runaway absence; she appeared to know and to\nunderstand everything which had happened since his return to the town.\nHe had not, in his turn, reached the point where he would begin to\nquestion her; he was too breathless in his consciousness of the\nmarvellous present hour.  She had told him of the death of Roger Tabor,\nthe year before.  \"Poor man,\" she said, gently, \"he lived to see 'how\nthe other fellows did it' at last, and everybody liked him.  He was\nvery happy over there.\"\n\nAfter a little while she had said that it was growing close upon\nlunch-time; she must be going back.\n\n\"Then--then--good-bye,\" he replied, ruefully.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't understand.  It wouldn't do for you to be seen\nwith me.  Perhaps, though, you do understand.  Wasn't that why you\nasked me to meet you out here beyond the bridge?\"\n\nIn answer she looked at him full and straight for three seconds, then\nthrew back her head and closed her eyes tight with laughter.  Without a\nword she took the parasol from him, opened it herself, placed the\nsmooth white coral handle of it in his hand, and lightly took his arm.\nThere was no further demur on the part of the young man.  He did not\nknow where she was going; he did not ask.\n\nSoon after Norbert turned to follow them, they came to the shady part\nof the street, where the town in summer was like a grove.  Detachments\nfrom the procession had already, here and there, turned in at the\nvarious gates.  Nobody, however, appeared to have gone in-doors, except\nfor fans, armed with which immediately to return to rockers upon the\nshaded verandas.  As Miss Tabor and Joe went by, the rocking-chairs\nstopped; the fans poised, motionless; and perspiring old gentlemen,\nwiping their necks, paused in arrested attitudes.\n\nOnce Ariel smiled politely, not at Mr. Louden, and inclined her head\ntwice, with the result that the latter, after thinking for a time of\nhow gracefully she did it and how pretty the top of her hat was, became\ngradually conscious of a meaning in her action: that she had bowed to\nsome one across the street.  He lifted his hat, about four minutes\nlate, and discovered Mamie Pike and Eugene, upon the opposite pavement,\nwalking home from church together.  Joe changed color.\n\nThere, just over the way, was she who had been, in his first youth, the\nfairy child, the little princess playing in the palace yard, and always\nafterward his lady of dreams, his fair unreachable moon!  And Joe,\nseeing her to-day, changed color; that was all! He had passed Mamie in\nthe street only a week before, and she had seemed all that she had\nalways seemed; to-day an incomprehensible and subtle change had\nbefallen her--a change so mystifying to him that for a moment he almost\ndoubted that she was Mamie Pike.  It came to him with a breath-taking\nshock that her face lacked a certain vivacity of meaning; that its\nsweetness was perhaps too placid; that there would have been a deeper\ngoodness in it had there been any hint of daring. Astonishing questions\nassailed him, startled him: could it be true that, after all, there\nmight be some day too much of her?  Was her amber hair a little\ntoo--FLUFFY?  Was something the matter with her dress?  Everything she\nwore had always seemed so beautiful.  Where had the exquisiteness of it\ngone? For there was surely no exquisiteness about it now! It was\nincredible that any one could so greatly alter in the few days elapsed\nsince he had seen her.\n\nStrange matters!  Mamie had never looked prettier.\n\nAt the sound of Ariel's voice he emerged from the profundities of his\npsychic enigma with a leap.\n\n\"She is lovelier than ever, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he answered, blankly.\n\n\"Would you still risk--\" she began, smiling, but, apparently thinking\nbetter of it, changed her question:  \"What is the name of your dog, Mr.\nLouden?  You haven't told me.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's just a yellow dog,\" he evaded, unskilfully.\n\n\"YOUNG MAN!\" she said, sharply.\n\n\"Well,\" he admitted, reluctantly, \"I call him Speck for short.\"\n\n\"And what for long?  I want to know his real name.\"\n\n\"It's mighty inappropriate, because we're fond of each other,\" said\nJoe, \"but when I picked him up he was so yellow, and so thin, and so\ncreeping, and so scared that I christened him 'Respectability.'\"\n\nShe broke into light laughter, stopped short in the midst of it, and\nbecame grave.  \"Ah, you've grown bitter,\" she said, gently.\n\n\"No, no,\" he protested.  \"I told you I liked him.\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\nThey were now opposite the Pike Mansion, and to his surprise she\nturned, indicating the way by a touch upon his sleeve, and crossed the\nstreet toward the gate, which Mamie and Eugene had entered. Mamie,\nafter exchanging a word with Eugene upon the steps, was already\nhurrying into the house.\n\nAriel paused at the gate, as if waiting for Joe to open it.\n\nHe cocked his head, his higher eyebrow rose, and the distorted smile\nappeared.  \"I don't believe we'd better stop here,\" he said.  \"The last\ntime I tried it I was expunged from the face of the universe.\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" she cried.  \"I'm staying here.  Judge Pike has charge\nof all my property; he was the administrator, or something.\"  Then\nseeing him chopfallen and aghast, she went on: \"Of course you don't\nknow!  You don't know anything about me.  You haven't even asked!\"\n\n\"You're going to live HERE?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Will you come to see me?\" she laughed.  \"Will you come this afternoon?\"\n\nHe grew white.  \"You know I can't,\" he said.\n\n\"You came here once.  You risked a good deal then, just to see Mamie\ndance by a window.  Don't you dare a little for an old friend?\"\n\n\"All right,\" he gulped.  \"I'll try.\"\n\nMr. Bantry had come down to the gate and was holding it open, his eyes\nfixed upon Ariel, within them a rising glow.  An impression came to Joe\nafterward that his step-brother had looked very handsome.\n\n\"Possibly you remember me, Miss Tabor?\" said Eugene, in a deep and\nimpressive voice, lifting his hat.  \"We were neighbors, I believe, in\nthe old days.\"\n\nShe gave him her hand in a fashion somewhat mannerly, favoring him with\na bright, negligent smile.  \"Oh, quite,\" she answered, turning again to\nJoe as she entered the gate.  \"Then I shall expect you?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Joe.  \"I'll try.\"\n\nHe stumbled away; Respectability and he, together,\n interfering alarmingly with the comfort of\nMr. Flitcroft, who had stopped in the middle of the pavement to stare\nglassily at Ariel.  Eugene accompanied the latter into the house, and\nJoe, looking back, understood:  Mamie had sent his step-brother to\nbring Ariel in--and to keep him from following.\n\n\"This afternoon!\"  The thought took away his breath, and he became\npaler.\n\nThe Pike brougham rolled by him, and Sam Warden, from the box, favored\nhis old friend upon the pavement with a liberal display of the whites\nof his eyes.  The Judge, evidently, had been detained after\nservices--without doubt a meeting of the church officials.  Mrs. Pike,\nblinking and frightened, sat at her husband's side, agreeing feebly\nwith the bull-bass which rumbled out of the open window of the\nbrougham:  \"I want orthodox preaching in MY church, and, by God, madam,\nI'll have it!  That fellow has got to go!\" Joe took off his hat and\nwiped his brow.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTO REMAIN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS A VICTORY\n\nMamie, waiting just inside the door as Ariel and Eugene entered, gave\nthe visitor a pale greeting, and, a moment later, hearing the wheels of\nthe brougham crunch the gravel of the carriage-drive, hurried away,\ndown the broad hall, and disappeared.  Ariel dropped her parasol upon a\nmarble-topped table near the door, and, removing her gloves, drifted\ninto a room at the left, where a grand piano found shelter beneath\ncrimson plush.  After a moment of contemplation, she pushed back the\ncoverlet, and, seating herself upon the plush-covered piano-stool (to\nmatch), let her fingers run up and down the key-board once and fall\nlistlessly in her lap, as she gazed with deep interest at three\nlife-sized colored photographs (in carved gilt frames) upon the wall\nshe was facing: Judge Pike, Mamie, and Mrs. Pike with her rubies.\n\n\"Please don't stop playing, Miss Tabor,\" said a voice behind her.  She\nhad not observed that Eugene had followed her into the room.\n\n\"Very well, if you like,\" she answered, looking up to smile absently at\nhim.  And she began to play a rakish little air which, composed by some\nrattle-brain at a cafe table, had lately skipped out of the Moulin\nRouge to disport itself over Paris. She played it slowly, in the minor,\nwith elfish pathos; while he leaned upon the piano, his eyes fixed upon\nher fingers, which bore few rings, none, he observed with an\nunreasonable pleasure, upon the third finger of the left hand.\n\n\"It's one of those simpler Grieg things, isn't it?\" he said, sighing\ngently.  \"I care for Grieg.\"\n\n\"Would you mind its being Chaminade?\" she returned, dropping her eyes\nto cloak the sin.\n\n\"Ah no; I recognize it now,\" replied Eugene. \"He appeals to me even\nmore than Grieg.\"\n\nAt this she glanced quickly up at him, but more quickly down again, and\nhastened the time emphatically, swinging the little air into the major.\n\n\"Do you play the 'Pilgrim's Chorus'?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Vous name pas Wagner?\" inquired Eugene, leaning toward her.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she answered, bending her head far over, so that her face was\nconcealed from him, except the chin, which, he saw with a thrill of\ninexplicable emotion, was trembling slightly. There were some small\nwhite flowers upon her hat, and these shook too.\n\nShe stopped playing abruptly, rose from the stool and crossed the room\nto a large mahogany chair, upholstered in red velvet and of hybrid\nconstruction, possessing both rockers and legs.  She had moved in a way\nwhich prevented him from seeing her face, but he was certain of her\nagitation, and strangely glad, while curious, tremulous half-thoughts,\nedged with prophecy, bubbled to the surface of his consciousness.\n\nWhen she turned to him, he was surprised to see that she looked\nastonishingly happy, almost as if she had been struggling with joy,\ninstead of pain.\n\n\"This chair,\" she said, sinking into it, \"makes me feel at home.\"\n\nNaturally he could not understand.\n\n\"Because,\" she explained, \"I once thought I was going to live in it.\nIt has been reupholstered, but I should know it if I met in anywhere in\nthe world!\"\n\n\"How very odd!\" exclaimed Eugene, staring.\n\n\"I settled here in pioneer days,\" she went on, tapping the arms lightly\nwith her finger-tips.  \"It was the last dance I went to in Canaan.\"\n\n\"I fear the town was very provincial at that time,\" he returned, having\ncompletely forgotten the occasion she mentioned, therefore wishing to\nshift the subject.  \"I fear you may still find it so.  There is not\nmuch here that one is in sympathy with, intellectually--few people\nreally of the world.\"\n\n\"Few people, I suppose you mean,\" she said, softly, with a look that\nwent deep enough into his eyes, \"few people who really understand one?\"\n\nEugene had seated himself on the sill of an open window close by.\n\"There has been,\" he answered, with the ghost of a sigh, \"no one.\"\n\nShe turned her head slightly away from him, apparently occupied with a\nloose thread in her sleeve. There were no loose threads; it was an old\nhabit of hers which she retained.  \"I suppose,\" she murmured, in a\nvoice as low as his had been, \"that a man of your sort might find\nCanaan rather lonely and sad.\"\n\n\"It HAS been!\"  Whereupon she made him a laughing little bow.\n\n\"You are sure you complain of Canaan?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" he exclaimed.  \"You don't know what it is to live here--\"\n\n\"I think I do.  I lived here seventeen years.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he began to object, \"as a child, but--\"\n\n\"Have you any recollection,\" she interrupted, \"of the day before your\nbrother ran away?  Of coming home for vacation--I think it was your\nfirst year in college--and intervening between your brother and me in a\nsnow-fight?\"\n\nFor a moment he was genuinely perplexed; then his face cleared.\n\"Certainly,\" he said:  \"I found him bullying you and gave him a good\npunishing for it.\"\n\n\"Is that all you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, honestly.  \"Wasn't that all?\"\n\n\"Quite!\" she smiled, her eyes half closed. \"Except that I went home\nimmediately afterward.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Eugene.  \"My step-brother wasn't very much chevalier\nsans peur et sans reproche! Ah, I should like to polish up my French a\nlittle.  Would you mind my asking you to read a bit with me, some\nlittle thing of Daudet's if you care for him, in the original?  An\nhour, now and then, perhaps--\"\n\nMamie appeared in the doorway and Eugene rose swiftly.  \"I have been\ntrying to persuade Miss Tabor,\" he explained, with something too much\nof laughter, \"to play again.  You heard that little thing of\nChaminade's--\"\n\nMamie did not appear to hear him; she entered breathlessly, and there\nwas no color in her cheeks. \"Ariel,\" she exclaimed, \"I don't want you\nto think I'm a tale-bearer--\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" Ariel said, with a gesture of deprecation.\n\n\"No,\" Miss Pike went on, all in one breath, \"but I'm afraid you will\nthink it, because papa knows and he wants to see you.\"\n\n\"What is it that he knows?\"\n\n\"That you were walking with Joseph Louden!\" (This was as if she had\nsaid, \"That you poisoned your mother.\")  \"I DIDN'T tell him, but when\nwe saw you with him I was troubled, and asked Eugene what I'd better\ndo, because Eugene always knows what is best.\"  (Mr. Bantry's\nexpression, despite this tribute, was not happy.)  \"And he advised me\nto tell mamma about it and leave it in her hands.  But she always tells\npapa everything--\"\n\n\"Certainly; that is understood,\" said Ariel, slowly, turning to smile\nat Eugene.\n\n\"And she told him this right away,\" Mamie finished.\n\n\"Why shouldn't she, if it is of the slightest interest to him?\"\n\nThe daughter of the house exhibited signs of consternation.  \"He wants\nto see you,\" she repeated, falteringly.  \"He's in the library.\"\n\nHaving thus discharged her errand, she hastened to the front-door,\nwhich had been left open, and out to the steps, evidently with the\nintention of removing herself as soon and as far as possible from the\nvicinity of the library.\n\nEugene, visibly perturbed, followed her to the doorway of the room, and\npaused.\n\n\"Do you know the way?\" he inquired, with a note of solemnity.\n\n\"Where?\" Ariel had not risen.\n\n\"To the library.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, beaming upon him.  \"I was about to ask you if\nyou wouldn't speak to the Judge for me.  This is such a comfortable old\nfriend, this chair.\"\n\n\"Speak to him for you?\" repeated the non-plussed Eugene.\n\nShe nodded cheerfully.  \"If I may trouble you. Tell him, certainly, I\nshall be glad to see him.\"\n\nHe threw a piteous glance after Mamie, who was now, as he saw, through\nthe open door, out upon the lawn and beyond easy hailing distance.\nWhen he turned again to look at Ariel he discovered that she had\nshifted the position of her chair slightly, and was gazing out of the\nwindow with every appearance of cheerful meditation.  She assumed so\nunmistakably that he had of course gone on her mission that, dismayed\nand his soul quaking, he could find neither an alternative nor words to\nexplain to this dazzling lady that not he nor any other could bear such\na message to Martin Pike.\n\nEugene went.  There was nothing else to do; and he wished with every\nstep that the distance to the portals of the library might have been\ngreater.\n\nIn whatever guise he delivered the summons, it was perfectly\nefficacious.  A door slammed, a heavy and rapid tread was heard in the\nhall, and Ariel, without otherwise moving, turned her head and offered\na brilliant smile of greeting.\n\n\"It was good of you,\" she said, as the doorway filled with red,\nimperial wrath, \"to wish to have a little chat with me.  I'm anxious,\nof course, to go over my affairs with you, and last night, after my\njourney, I was too tired.  But now we might begin; not in detail, of\ncourse, just yet.  That will do for later, when I've learned more about\nbusiness.\"\n\nThe great one had stopped on the threshold.\n\n\"Madam,\" he began, coldly, \"when I say my library, I mean my--\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she interrupted, with amiable weariness. \"I know.  You mean\nyou keep all the papers and books of the estate in there, but I think\nwe'd better put them off for a few days--\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about the estate!\" he exclaimed. \"What I want to talk\nto you about is being seen with Joseph Louden!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she nodded, brightly.  \"That's along the line we must take up\nfirst.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is!\" He hurled his bull-bass at her. \"You knew everything\nabout him and his standing in this community!  I know you did, because\nMrs. Pike told me you asked all about him from Mamie after you came\nlast night, and, see here, don't you--\"\n\n\"Oh, but I knew before that,\" she laughed.  \"I had a correspondent in\nCanaan, one who has always taken a great interest in Mr. Louden.  I\nasked Miss Pike only to get her own point of view.\"\n\n\"I want to tell you, madam,\" he shouted, coming toward her, \"that no\nmember of my household--\"\n\n\"That's another point we must take up to-day. I'm glad you remind me of\nit,\" she said, thoughtfully, yet with so magically compelling an\nintonation that he stopped his shouting in the middle of a word;\nstopped with an apoplectic splutter.  \"We must arrange to put the old\nhouse in order at once.\"\n\n\"We'll arrange nothing of the sort,\" he responded, after a moment of\nangry silence.  \"You're going to stay right here.\"\n\n\"Ah, I know your hospitality,\" she bowed, graciously.  \"But of course I\nmust not tax it too far.  And about Mr. Louden?  As I said, I want to\nspeak to you about him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he intervened, harshly.  \"So do I, and I'm going to do it quick!\nYou'll find--\"\n\nAgain she mysteriously baffled him.  \"He's a dear old friend of mine,\nyou know, and I have made up my mind that we both need his help, you\nand I.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she continued, calmly, \"in a business way I mean.  I know you\nhave great interests in a hundred directions, all more important than\nmine; it isn't fair that you should bear the whole burden of my\naffairs, and I think it will be best to retain Mr. Louden as my man of\nbusiness.  He could take all the cares of the estate off your\nshoulders.\"\n\nMartin Pike spoke no word, but he looked at her strangely; and she\nwatched him with sudden keenness, leaning forward in her chair, her\ngaze alert but quiet, fixed on the dilating pupils of his eyes.  He\nseemed to become dizzy, and the choleric scarlet which had overspread\nhis broad face and big neck faded splotchily.\n\nStill keeping her eyes upon him, she went on: \"I haven't asked him yet,\nand so I don't know whether or not he'll consent, but I think it\npossible that he may come to see me this afternoon, and if he does we\ncan propose it to him together and go over things a little.\"\n\nJudge Pike recovered his voice.  \"He'll get a warm welcome,\" he\npromised, huskily, \"if he sets foot on my premises!\"\n\n\"You mean you prefer I shouldn't receive him here?\" She nodded\npleasantly.  \"Then certainly I shall not.  Such things are much better\nfor offices; you are quite right.\"\n\n\"You'll not see him at all!\"\n\n\"Ah, Judge Pike,\" she lifted her hand with gentle deprecation, \"don't\nyou understand that we can't quite arrange that?  You see, Mr. Louden\nis even an older friend of mine than you are, and so I must trust his\nadvice about such things more than yours.  Of course, if he too should\nthink it better for me not to see him--\"\n\nThe Judge advanced toward her.  \"I'm tired of this,\" he began, in a\nloud voice.  \"I'm--\"\n\nShe moved as if to rise, but he had come very close, leaning above her,\none arm out-stretched and at the end of it a heavy forefinger which he\nwas shaking at her, so that it was difficult to get out of her chair\nwithout pushing him away--a feat apparently impossible.  Ariel Tabor,\nin rising, placed her hand upon his out-stretched arm, quite as if he\nhad offered it to assist her; he fell back a step in complete\nastonishment; she rose quickly, and released his arm.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, beamingly.  \"It's quite all my fault that you're\ntired.  I've been thoughtless to keep you so long, and you have been\nstanding, too!\"  She swept lightly and quickly to the door, where she\npaused, gathering her skirts.  \"I shall not detain you another instant!\nAnd if Mr. Louden comes, this afternoon, I'll remember.  I'll not let\nhim come in, of course.  It will be perhaps pleasanter to talk over my\nproposition as we walk!\"\n\nThere was a very faint, spicy odor like wild roses and cinnamon left in\nthe room where Martin Pike stood alone, staring whitely at the open\ndoorway.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHE WATCHER AND THE WARDEN\n\nThere was a custom of Canaan, time-worn and seldom honored in the\nbreach, which put Ariel, that afternoon, in easy possession of a coign\nof vantage commanding the front gate.  The heavy Sunday dinner was\nfinished in silence (on the part of Judge Pike, deafening) about three\no'clock, and, soon after, Mamie tossed a number of cushions out upon\nthe stoop between the cast-iron dogs,--Sam Warden having previously\ncovered the steps with a rug and placed several garden chairs near by\non the grass.  These simple preparations concluded, Eugene sprawled\ncomfortably upon the rug, and Mamie seated herself near him, while\nAriel wandered with apparent aimlessness about the lawn, followed by\nthe gaze of Mr. Bantry, until Miss Pike begged her, a little\npetulantly, to join them.\n\nShe came, looking about her dreamily, and touching to her lips, now and\nthen, with an absent air, a clover blossom she had found in the longer\ngrass against the fence.  She stopped to pat the neck of one of the\ncast-iron deer, and with grave eyes proffered the clover-top first for\ninspection, then as food.  There were those in the world who, seeing\nher, might have wondered that the deer did not play Galatea and come to\nlife.\n\n\"No?\" she said, aloud, to the steadfast head. \"You won't?  What a\nmistake to be made of cast-iron!\"  She smiled and nodded to a clump of\nlilac-bushes near a cedar-tree, and to nothing else--so far as Eugene\nand Mamie could see,--then walked thoughtfully to the steps.\n\n\"Who in the world were you speaking to?\" asked Mamie, curiously.\n\n\"That deer.\"\n\n\"But you bowed to some one.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" Ariel lifted her eyebrows,--\"that was your father.  Didn't\nyou see him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I believe you can't from here, after all,\" said Ariel, slowly.  \"He is\nsitting upon a rustic bench between the bushes and the cedar-tree,\nquite near the gate.  No, you couldn't see him from here; you'd have to\ngo as far as the deer, at least, and even then you might not notice\nhim, unless you looked for him.  He has a book--a Bible, I think--but I\ndon't think he is reading.\"\n\n\"He usually takes a nap on Sunday afternoons,\" said Mamie.\n\n\"I don't think he will, to-day.\"  Ariel looked at Eugene, who avoided\nher clear gaze.  \"He has the air of having settled himself to stay for\na long time, perhaps until evening.\"\n\nShe had put on her hat after dinner, and Mamie now inquired if she\nwould not prefer to remove it, offering to carry it in-doors for her,\nto Ariel's room, to insure its safety.  \"You look so sort of temporary,\nwearing it,\" she urged, \"as if you were only here for a little while.\nIt's the loveliest hat I ever saw, and so fragile, too, but I'll take\ncare--\"\n\nAriel laughed, leaned over, and touched the other's hand lightly.  \"It\nisn't that, dear.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"  Mamie beamed out into a joyful smile.  She had\nfelt sure that she could not understand Ariel; was, indeed, afraid of\nher; and she found herself astonishingly pleased to be called \"dear,\"\nand delighted with the little familiarity of the hand-tap.  Her feeling\ntoward the visitor (who was, so her father had announced, to become a\npermanent member of the household) had been, until now, undefined.  She\nhad been on her guard, watching for some sign of conscious\n\"superiority\" in this lady who had been so long over-seas, not knowing\nwhat to make of her; though thrown, by the contents of her trunks, into\na wistfulness which would have had something of rapture in it had she\nbeen sure that she was going to like Ariel. She had gone to the\nlatter's room before church, and had perceived uneasily that it had\nbecome, even by the process of unpacking, the prettiest room she had\never seen.  Mrs. Warden, wife of Sam, and handmaiden of the mansion,\nwas assisting, alternately faint and vociferous with marvelling. Mamie\nfeared that Ariel might be a little overpowering.\n\nWith the word \"dear\" (that is, of course, with the way it was spoken),\nand with the touch upon the hand, it was all suddenly settled; she\nwould not understand Ariel always--that was clear--but they would like\neach other.\n\n\"I am wearing my hat,\" answered Ariel, \"because at any moment I may\ndecide to go for a long walk!\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope not,\" said Mamie.  \"There are sure to be people: a few\nstill come, even though I'm an engaged girl.  I expect that's just to\nconsole me, though,\" she added, smiling over this worn quip of the\nbetrothed, and shaking her head at Eugene, who grew red and coughed.\n\"There'll be plenty to-day, but they won't be here to see me.  It's\nyou, Ariel, and they'd be terribly disappointed if you weren't here.  I\nshouldn't wonder if the whole town came; it's curious enough about you!\"\n\nCanaan (at least that part of it which Mamie meant when she said \"the\nwhole town\") already offered testimony to her truthfulness.  Two\ngentlemen, aged nine and eleven, and clad in white \"sailor suits,\" were\nat that moment grooving their cheeks between the round pickets of the\ngate. They had come from the house across the street, evidently\nstimulated by the conversation at their own recent dinner-table (they\nwore a few deposits such as are left by chocolate-cake), and the motive\nof their conduct became obvious when, upon being joined by a person\nfrom next door (a starched and frilled person of the opposite sex but\nsympathetic age), one of them waggled a forefinger through the gate at\nAriel, and a voice was heard in explanation:\n\n\"THAT'S HER.\"\n\nThere was a rustle in the lilac-bushes near the cedar-tree; the three\nsmall heads turned simultaneously in that direction; something terrific\nwas evidently seen, and with a horrified \"OOOH!\" the trio skedaddled\nheadlong.\n\nThey were but the gay vanguard of the life which the street, quite dead\nthrough the Sunday dinner-hour, presently took on.  Young couples with\ntheir progeny began to appear, returning from the weekly reunion Sunday\ndinner with relatives; young people meditative (until they reached the\nPike Mansion), the wives fanning themselves or shooing the\ntots-able-to-walk ahead of them, while the husbands, wearing long\ncoats, satin ties, and showing dust upon their blazing shoes,\ninvariably pushed the perambulators.  Most of these passers-by\nexchanged greetings with Mamie and Eugene, and all of them looked hard\nat Ariel as long as it was possible.\n\nAnd now the young men of the town, laboriously arranged as to apparel,\nbegan to appear on the street in small squads, making their Sunday\nrounds; the youngest working in phalanxes of threes and fours, those\nsomewhat older inclining to move in pairs; the eldest, such as were now\nbeginning to be considered middle-aged beaux, or (by the extremely\nyouthful) \"old bachelors,\" evidently considered it advantageous to\ntravel alone.  Of all these, there were few who did not, before evening\nfell, turn in at the gate of the Pike Mansion. Consciously, shyly or\nconfidently, according to the condition of their souls, they made their\nway between the cast-iron deer to be presented to the visitor.\n\nAriel sat at the top of the steps, and, looking amiably over their\nheads, talked with such as could get near her.  There were many who\ncould not, and Mamie, occupying the bench below, was surrounded by the\noverflow.  The difficulty of reaching and maintaining a position near\nMiss Tabor was increased by the attitude and behavior of Mr. Flitcroft,\nwho that day cooled the feeling of friendship which several of his\nfellow-townsmen had hitherto entertained for him.  He had been the\nfirst to arrive, coming alone, though that was not his custom, and he\nestablished himself at Ariel's right, upon the step just below her, so\ndisposing the great body and the ponderous arms and legs the gods had\ngiven him, that no one could mount above him to sit beside her, or\napproach her from that direction within conversational distance.  Once\nestablished, he was not to be dislodged, and the only satisfaction for\nthose in this manner debarred from the society of the beautiful\nstranger was obtained when they were presented to her and when they\ntook their departure. On these occasions it was necessary by custom for\nthem to shake her hand, a ceremony they accomplished by leaning across\nMr. Flitcroft, which was a long way to lean, and the fat back and\nshoulders were sore that night because of what had been surreptitiously\ndone to them by revengeful elbows and knees.\n\nNorbert, not ordinarily talkative, had nothing to say; he seemed to\nfind sufficient occupation in keeping the place he had gained; and from\nthis close vantage he fastened his small eyes immovably upon Ariel's\nprofile.  Eugene, also apparently determined not to move, sat\nthroughout the afternoon at her left, but as he was thin, others, who\ncame and went, were able to approach upon that side and hold speech\nwith her.\n\nShe was a stranger to these young people, most of whom had grown up\ntogether in a nickname intimacy.  Few of them had more than a very\nimperfect recollection of her as she was before Roger Tabor and she had\ndeparted out of Canaan.  She had lived her girlhood only upon their\nborderland, with no intimates save her grandfather and Joe; and she\nreturned to her native town \"a revelation and a dream,\" as young Mr.\nBradbury told his incredulous grandmother that night.\n\nThe conversation of the gallants consisted, for the greater part, of\nwitticisms at one another's expense, which, though evoked for Ariel's\nbenefit (all eyes furtively reverting to her as each shaft was loosed),\nshe found more or less enigmatical.  The young men, however, laughed at\neach other loudly, and seemed content if now and then she smiled. \"You\nmust be frightfully ennuied with all this,\" Eugene said to her.  \"You\nsee how provincial we still are.\"\n\nShe did not answer; she had not heard him.  The shadows were stretching\nthemselves over the grass, long and attenuated; the sunlight upon the\ntrees and houses was like a thin, rosy pigment; black birds were\ncalling each other home to beech and elm; and Ariel's eyes were fixed\nupon the western distance of the street where gold-dust was beginning\nto quiver in the air.  She did not hear Eugene, but she started, a\nmoment later, when the name \"Joe Louden\" was pronounced by a young man,\nthe poetic Bradbury, on the step below Eugene. Some one immediately\nsaid \"'SH!\"  But she leaned over and addressed Mr. Bradbury, who, shut\nout, not only from the group about her, but from the other centring\nupon Miss Pike, as well, was holding a private conversation with a\nfriend in like misfortune.\n\n\"What were you saying of Mr. Louden?\" she asked, smiling down upon the\nyoung man.  (It was this smile which inspired his description of her as\n\"a revelation and a dream.\")\n\n\"Oh, nothing particular,\" was his embarrassed reply.  \"I only mentioned\nI'd heard there was some talk among the--\"  He paused awkwardly,\nremembering that Ariel had walked with Joseph Louden in the face of\nCanaan that very day. \"That is, I mean to say, there's some talk of his\nrunning for Mayor.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"\n\nThere was a general exclamation, followed by an uncomfortable moment or\ntwo of silence.  No one present was unaware of that noon walk, though\nthere was prevalent a pleasing notion that it would not happen again,\nfounded on the idea that Ariel, having only arrived the previous\nevening, had probably met Joe on the street by accident, and,\nremembering him as a playmate of her childhood and uninformed as to his\nreputation, had, naturally enough, permitted him to walk home with her.\n\nMr. Flitcroft broke the silence, rushing into words with a derisive\nlaugh:  \"Yes, he's 'talked of' for Mayor--by the saloon people and the\nniggers!  I expect the Beaver Beach crowd would be for him, and if\ntramps could vote he might--\"\n\n\"What is Beaver Beach?\" asked Ariel, not turning.\n\n\"What is Beaver Beach?\" he repeated, and cast his eyes to the sky,\nshaking his head awesomely. \"It's a Place,\" he said, with abysmal\nsolemnity,--\"a Place I shouldn't have mentioned in your presence, Miss\nTabor.\"\n\n\"What has it to do with Mr. Louden?\"\n\nThe predestined Norbert conceived the present to be a heaven-sent\nopportunity to enlighten her concerning Joe's character, since the\nPikes appeared to have been derelict in the performance of this\nkindness.\n\n\"He goes there!\" he proceeded heavily.  \"He lived there for a while\nwhen he first came back from running away, and he's a friend of Mike\nSheehan's that runs it; he's a friend of all the riff-raff that hang\naround there.\"\n\n\"How do you know he goes there?\"\n\n\"Why, it was in the paper the day after he came back!\"  He appealed for\ncorroboration.  \"Wasn't it, Eugene?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she persisted.  \"Newspapers are sometimes mistaken, aren't\nthey?\"  Laughing a little, she swept across the bulbous face beside her\na swift regard that was like a search-light.  \"How do you KNOW, Mr.\nFlitcroft,\" she went on very rapidly, raising her voice,--\"how do you\nKNOW that Mr. Louden is familiar with this place?  The newspapers may\nhave been falsely informed; you must admit that?  Then how do you KNOW?\nHave you ever MET any one who has seen him there?\"\n\n\"I've seen him there myself!\"  The words skipped out of Norbert's mouth\nlike so many little devils, the instant he opened it.  She had spoken\nso quickly and with such vehemence, looking him full in the eye, that\nhe had forgotten everything in the world except making the point to\nwhich her insistence had led him.\n\nMamie looked horrified; there was a sound of smothered laughter, and\nNorbert, overwhelmed by the treachery of his own mouth, sat gasping.\n\n\"It can't be such a terrific place, then, after all,\" said Ariel,\ngently, and turning to Eugene, \"Have you ever been there, Mr. Bantry?\"\nshe asked.\n\nHe changed color, but answered with enough glibness:  \"No.\"\n\nSeveral of the young men rose; the wretched Flitcroft, however, evading\nMamie's eye--in which there was a distinct hint,--sat where he was\nuntil all of them, except Eugene, had taken a reluctant departure, one\ngroup after another, leaving in the order of their arrival.\n\nThe rosy pigment which had colored the trees faded; the gold-dust of\nthe western distance danced itself pale and departed; dusk stalked into\nthe town from the east; and still the watcher upon the steps and the\nwarden of the gate (he of the lilac-bushes and the Bible) held their\nplaces and waited--waited, alas! in vain....  Ah! Joe, is THIS the\nmettle of your daring?  Did you not say you would \"try\"?  Was your\ncourage so frail a vessel that it could not carry you even to the gate\nyonder? Surely you knew that if you had striven so far, there you would\nhave been met!  Perhaps you foresaw that not one, but two, would meet\nyou at the gate, both the warden and the watcher.  What of that?  What\nof that, O faint heart?  What was there to fear?  Listen!  The gate\nclicks.  Ah, have you come at last?\n\nAriel started to her feet, but the bent figure, coming up the walk in\nthe darkness, was that of Eskew Arp.  He bowed gloomily to Mamie, and\nin response to her inquiry if he wished to see her father, answered no;\nhe had come to talk with the granddaughter of his old friend Roger\nTabor.\n\n\"Mr. Arp!\" called Ariel.  \"I am so very glad!\" She ran down to him and\ngave him her hand. \"We'll sit here on the bench, sha'n't we?\"\n\nMamie had risen, and skirting Norbert frostily, touched Eugene upon the\nshoulder as she went up the steps.  He understood that he was to follow\nher in-doors, and, after a deep look at the bench where Ariel had\nseated herself beside Mr. Arp, he obeyed.  Norbert was left a lonely\nruin between the cold, twin dogs.  He had wrought desolation this\nafternoon, and that sweet verdure, his good name, so long in the\nplanting, so carefully tended, was now a dreary waste; yet he\ncontemplated this not so much as his present aspect of splendid\nisolation.  Frozen by the daughter of the house, forgotten by the\nvisitor, whose conversation with Mr. Arp was carried on in tones so low\nthat he could not understand it, the fat one, though heart-breakingly\nloath to take himself away, began to comprehend that his hour had\nstruck.  He rose, descended the steps to the bench, and seated himself\nunexpectedly upon the cement walk at Ariel's feet. \"Leg's gone to\nsleep,\" he explained, in response to her startled exclamation; but,\nlike a great soul, ignoring the accident of his position as well as the\npresence of Mr. Arp, he immediately proceeded: \"Will you go riding with\nme to-morrow afternoon?\"\n\n\"Aren't you very good-natured, Mr. Flitcroft?\" she asked, with an odd\nintonation.\n\n\"I'm imposed on, often enough,\" he replied, rubbing his leg, \"by people\nwho think I am!  Why?\"\n\n\"It is only that your sitting so abruptly upon the ground reminded me\nof something that happened long ago, before I left Canaan, the last\ntime I met you.\"\n\n\"I don't think I knew you before you went away.  You haven't said if\nyou'll go riding with me to-morrow.  Please--\"\n\n\"Get up,\" interrupted Mr. Arp, acidly.  \"Somebody 'll fall over you if\nyou stay there.\"\n\nSuch a catastrophe in truth loomed imminent. Judge Pike was rapidly\napproaching on his way to the house, Bible in hand--far better in hand\nthan was his temper, for it is an enraging thing to wait five hours in\nambush for a man who does not come.  In the darkness a desecration\noccurred, and Norbert perfected to the last detail whatever had been\nleft incomplete of his own destruction. He began lumberingly to rise,\ntalking at the same time, urging upon Ariel the charms of the roadside;\nwild flowers were in blossom, he said, recounting the benefits she\nmight derive through acceptance of his invitation; and having, thus\nbusily, risen to his knees, became aware that some one was passing near\nhim.  This some one Mr. Flitcroft, absorbed in artful persuasions, may\nhave been betrayed by the darkness to mistake for Eugene.  Reaching out\nfor assistance, he mechanically seized upon the skirts of a coat, which\nhe put to the uses of a rope, coming up hand-over-hand with such noble\nweight and energy that he brought himself to his feet and the owner of\nthe coat to the ground simultaneously.  The latter, hideously\nastonished, went down with an objurgation so outrageous in venom that\nMr. Arp jumped with the shock.  Judge Pike got to his feet quickly, but\nnot so quickly as the piteous Flitcroft betook himself into the deep\nshadows of the street.  Only a word, hoarse and horror-stricken, was\nleft quivering on the night breeze by this accursed, whom the gods,\nintent upon his ruin, had early in the day, at his first sight of\nAriel, in good truth, made mad:  \"MURDER!\"\n\n\"Can I help you brush off, Judge?\" asked Eskew, rising painfully.\n\nEither Martin Pike was beyond words, or the courtesy proposed by the\nfeeble old fellow (for Eskew was now very far along in years, and\nlooked his age) emphasized too bitterly the indignity which had been\nput upon him: whatever the case, he went his way in-doors, leaving the\ncynic's offer unacknowledged.  Eskew sank back upon the bench, with the\nlittle rusty sounds, suggestions of creaks and sighs, which accompany\nthe movement of antiques.  \"I've always thought,\" he said, \"that the\nJudge had spells when he was hard of hearing.\"\n\nOblongs of light abruptly dropped from the windows confronting them,\none, falling across the bench, appropriately touching with lemon the\nacrid, withered face and trembling hands of the veteran.  \"You are\nyounger than you were nine years ago, Mr. Arp,\" said Ariel, gayly.  \"I\ncaught a glimpse of you upon the street, to-day, and I thought so then.\nNow I see that I was right.\"\n\n\"Me--YOUNGER!\" he groaned.  \"No, ma'am!  I'm mighty near through with\nthis fool world--and I'd be glad of it, if I didn't expect that if\nthere IS another one afterwards, it would be jest as ornery!\"\n\nShe laughed, leaning forward, resting her elbows on her knee, and her\nchin in her hand, so that the shadow of her hat shielded her eyes from\nthe light. \"I thought you looked surprised when you saw me to day.\"\n\n\"I reckon I did!\" he exclaimed.  \"Who wouldn't of been?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" he repeated, confounded by her simplicity.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she laughed.  \"That's what I'm anxious to know.\"\n\n\"Wasn't the whole town the same way?\" he demanded.  \"Did you meet\nanybody that didn't look surprised?\"\n\n\"But why should they?\"\n\n\"Good Lord Admighty!\" he broke out.  \"Ain't you got any\nlookin'-glasses?\"\n\n\"I think almost all I have are still in the customs warehouse.\"\n\n\"Then use Mamie Pike's,\" responded the old man.  \"The town never\ndreamed you were goin' to turn out pretty at all, let alone the WAY\nyou've turned out pretty!  The Tocsin had a good deal about your looks\nand so forth in it once, in a letter from Paris, but the folks that\nremembered you kind of set that down to the way papers talk about\nanybody with money, and nobody was prepared for it when they saw you.\nYou don't need to drop no curtseys to ME.\"  He set his mouth grimly, in\nresponse to the bow she made him.  \"_I_ think female beauty is like all\nother human furbelows, and as holler as heaven will be if only the good\npeople are let in!  But yet I did stop to look at you when you went\npast me to-day, and I kept on lookin', long as you were in sight.  I\nreckon I always will, when I git the chance, too--only shows what human\nnature IS!  But that wasn't all that folks were starin' at to-day.  It\nwas your walkin' with Joe Louden that really finished 'em, and I can\nsay it upset me more than anything I've seen for a good many years.\"\n\n\"Upset you, Mr. Arp?\" she cried.  \"I don't quite see.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head deploringly.  \"After what I'd written you\nabout that boy--\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, softly, touching his sleeve with her fingers, \"I\nhaven't thanked you for that.\"\n\n\"You needn't,\" he returned, sharply.  \"It was a pleasure.  Do you\nremember how easy and quick I promised you?\"\n\n\"I remember that you were very kind.\"\n\n\"Kind!\"  He gave forth an acid and chilling laugh.  \"It was about two\nmonths after Louden ran away, and before you and Roger left Canaan, and\nyou asked me to promise to write to you whenever word of that outcast\ncame--\"\n\n\"I didn't put it so, Mr. Arp.\"\n\n\"No, but you'd ought of!  You asked me to write you whatever news of\nhim should come, and if he came back to tell you how and when and all\nabout it.  And I did it, and kept you sharp on his record ever since he\nlanded here again.  Do you know why I've done it?  Do you know why I\npromised so quick and easy I WOULD do it?\"\n\n\"Out of the kindness of your heart, I think.\"\n\nThe acid laugh was repeated.  \"NO, ma 'am! You couldn't of guessed\ncolder.  I promised, and I kept my promise, because I knew there would\nnever be anything good to tell!  AND THERE NEVER WAS!\"\n\n\"Nothing at all?\" she insisted, gravely.\n\n\"Never!  I leave it to you if I've written one good word of him.\"\n\n\"You've written of the treatment he has received here,\" she began, \"and\nI've been able to see what he has borne--and bears!\"\n\n\"But have I written one word to show that he didn't deserve it all?\nHaven't I told you everything, of his associates, his--\"\n\n\"Indeed you have!\"\n\n\"Then do you wonder that I was more surprised than most when I saw you\nwalking with him to-day?  Because I knew you did it in cold blood and\nknowledge aforethought!  Other folks thought it was because you hadn't\nbeen here long enough to hear his reputation, but I KNEW!\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" she said, \"if you were disappointed when you saw me with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he snapped.  \"I was!\"\n\n\"I thought so.  I saw the consternation in your face!  You APPROVED,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\"\n\n\"Yes, you do!  I know it bothers you to have me read you between the\nlines, but for this once you must let me.  You are so consistent that\nyou are never disappointed when things turn out badly, or people are\nwicked or foolish, are you?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not.  I expect it.\"\n\n\"And you were disappointed in me to-day. Therefore, it must be that I\nwas doing something you knew was right and good.  You see?\"  She leaned\na little closer to him, smiling angelically. \"Ah, Mr. Arp,\" she cried,\n\"I know your secret: you ADMIRE me!\"\n\nHe rose, confused and incoherent, as full of denial as a detected\npickpocket.  \"I DON'T!  Me ADMIRE? WHAT?  It's an ornery world,\" he\nprotested. \"I don't admire any human that ever lived!\"\n\n\"Yes, you do,\" she persisted.  \"I've just proved it!  But that is the\nleast of your secret; the great thing is this: YOU ADMIRE MR. LOUDEN!\"\n\n\"I never heard such nonsense,\" he continued to protest, at the same\ntime moving down the walk toward the gate, leaning heavily on his\nstick. \"Nothin' of the kind.  There ain't any LOGIC to that kind of an\nargument, nor no REASON!\"\n\n\"You see, I understand you,\" she called after him.  \"I'm sorry you go\naway in the bitterness of being found out.\"\n\n\"Found out!\"  His stick ceased for a moment to tap the cement.  \"Pooh!\"\nhe ejaculated, uneasily.  There was a pause, followed by a malevolent\nchuckle.  \"At any rate,\" he said, with joy in the afterthought, \"you'll\nnever go walkin' with him AGAIN!\"\n\nHe waited for the answer, which came, after a time, sadly.  \"Perhaps\nyou are right.  Perhaps I shall not.\"\n\n\"Ha, I thought so!  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Arp.\"\n\n\nShe turned toward the lighted house.  Through the windows nearest her\nshe could see Mamie, seated in the familiar chair, following with happy\nand tender eyes the figure of Eugene, who was pacing up and down the\nroom.  The town was deadly quiet:  Ariel could hear the sound of\nfootsteps perhaps a block away.  She went to the gate and gazed a long\ntime into the empty street, watching the yellow grains of light, sieved\nthrough the maples from the arc lights on the corner, moving to and fro\nin the deep shadow as the lamp swung slightly in the night air.\nSomewhere, not far away, the peace was broken by the screams of a\n\"parlor organ,\" which honked and wailed in pious agonies (the intention\nwas hymnal), interminably protracting each spasm.  Presently a woman's\nvoice outdid the organ, a voice which made vivid the picture of the\nwoman who owned it, and the ploughed forehead of her, above the\nnose-glasses, when the \"grace-notes\" were proudly given birth.  \"Rescue\nthe Perishing\" was the startlingly appropriate selection, rendered with\ninconceivable lingering upon each syllable:  \"Roos-cyoo the\nPoor-oosh-oong!\"  At unexpected intervals two male voices, evidently\nbelonging to men who had contracted the habit of holding tin in their\nmouths, joined the lady in a thorough search for the Lost Chord.\n\nThat was the last of silence in Canaan for an hour or so.  The organ\nwas merely inaugural: across the street a piano sounded; firm,\nemphatic, determined, vocal competition with the instrument here also;\n\"Rock of Ages\" the incentive.  Another piano presently followed suit,\nin a neighboring house:  \"Precious Jewels.\"  More distant, a second\norgan was heard; other pianos, other organs, took up other themes; and\nas a wakeful puppy's barking will go over a village at night, stirring\nfirst the nearer dogs to give voice, these in turn stimulating those\nfarther away to join, one passing the excitement on to another, until\nhounds in farm-yards far beyond the town contribute to the\nlong-distance conversation, even so did \"Rescue the Perishing\" enliven\nthe greater part of Canaan.\n\nIt was this that made Ariel realize a thing of which hitherto she had\nnot been able to convince herself: that she was actually once more in\nthe town where she had spent her long-ago girlhood; now grown to seem\nthe girlhood of some other person.  It was true: her foot was on her\nnative heath and her name was Ariel Tabor--the very name of the girl\nwho had shared the town's disapproval with Joe Louden!  \"Rescue the\nPerishing\" brought it all back to her; and she listened to these\nsharply familiar rites of the Canaanite Sabbath evening with a shiver\nof pain.\n\nShe turned from the gate to go into the house, heard Eugene's voice at\nthe door, and paused.  He was saying good-night to Mamie.\n\n\"And please say 'au revoir' to Miss Tabor for me,\" he added, peering\nout under his hand.  \"I don't know where she can have gone.\"\n\n\"Probably she came in and went to her room,\" said Mamie.\n\n\"Don't forget to tell her 'au revoir.'\"\n\n\"I won't, dear.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"  She lifted her face and he kissed her perfunctorily.\nThen he came down the steps and went slowly toward the gate, looking\nabout him into the darkness as if searching for something; but Ariel\nhad fled away from the path of light that led from the open door.\n\nShe skimmed noiselessly across the lawn and paused at the side of the\nhouse, leaning against the veranda, where, on a night long past, a boy\nhad hid and a girl had wept.  A small creaking sound fell upon her ear,\nand she made out an ungainly figure approaching, wheeling something of\ncurious shape.\n\n\"Is that you, Sam?\" she said.\n\nMr. Warden stopped, close by.  \"Yes'm,\" he replied.  \"I'm a-gittin' out\nde hose to lay de dus' yonnah.\"  He stretched an arm along the\ncross-bar of the reel, relaxing himself, apparently, for conversation.\n\"Y'all done change consid'able, Miss Airil,\" he continued, with the\ndirectness of one sure of privilege.\n\n\"You think so, Sam?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.  Ev'ybody think so, _I_ reckon.  Be'n a tai'ble lot o' talkum\n'bout you to-day.  Dun'no' how all dem oth' young ladies goin' take\nit!\"  He laughed with immoderate delight, yet, as to the volume of mere\nsound, discreetly, with an eye to open windows.  \"You got 'em all beat,\nMiss Airil! Dey ain' be'n no one 'roun' dis town evah got in a thousum\nmile o' you!  Fer looks, an' de way you walk an' ca'y yo'self; an' as\nfer de clo'es--name o' de good lan', honey, dey ain' nevah SEE style\nbefo'! My ole woman say you got mo' fixin's in a minute dan de whole\nres' of 'em got in a yeah.  She say when she helpin' you onpack she\nmust 'a' see mo'n a hunerd paihs o' slippahs alone!  An' de good Man\nknows I 'membuh w'en you runnin' roun' back-yods an' up de alley\nrompin' 'ith Joe Louden, same you's a boy!\"\n\n\"Do you ever see Mr. Louden, nowadays?\" she asked.\n\nHis laugh was repeated with the same discreet violence.  \"Ain' I seen\nhim dis ve'y day, fur up de street at de gate yonnah, stan'in' 'ith\nyou, w'en I drivin' de Judge?\"\n\n\"You--you didn't happen to see him anywhere this--this afternoon?\"\n\n\"No'm, I ain' SEE him.\"  Sam's laughter vanished and his lowered voice\nbecame serious.  \"I ain' SEE him, but I hearn about him.\"\n\n\"What did you hear?\"\n\n\"Dey be'n consid'able stir on de aidge o' town, I reckon,\" he answered,\ngravely, \"an' dey be'n havin' some trouble out at de Beach--\"\n\n\"Beaver Beach, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.  Dey be'n some shootin' goin' on out dat way.\"\n\nShe sprang forward and caught at his arm without speaking.\n\n\"Joe Louden all right,\" he said, reassuringly. \"Ain' nuffum happen to\nhim!  Nigh as I kin mek out f'm de TALK, dat Happy Fear gone on de\nramPAGE ag'in, an' dey hatta sent fer Mist' Louden to come in a hurry.\"\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nWHITE ROSES IN A LAW-OFFICE\n\nAs upon a world canopied with storm, hung with mourning purple and\nhabited in black, did Mr. Flitcroft turn his morning face at eight\no'clock antemeridian Monday, as he hied himself to his daily duty at\nthe Washington National Bank.  Yet more than the merely funereal\ngloomed out from the hillocky area of his countenance.  Was there not,\ni'faith, a glow, a Vesuvian shimmer, beneath the murk of that darkling\neye? Was here one, think you, to turn the other cheek? Little has he\nlearned of Norbert Flitcroft who conceives that this fiery spirit was\neasily to be quenched!  Look upon the jowl of him, and let him who\ndares maintain that people--even the very Pikes themselves--were to\ngrind beneath their brougham wheels a prostrate Norbert and ride on\nscatheless! In this his own metaphor is nearly touched \"I guess not!\nThey don't run over ME!  Martin Pike better look out how he tries it!\"\n\nSo Mother Nature at her kindly tasks, good Norbert, uses for her\nunguent our own perfect inconsistency: and often when we are stabbed\ndeep in the breast she distracts us by thin scratches in other parts,\nthat in the itch of these we may forget the greater hurt till it be\nhealed.  Thus, the remembrance of last night, when you undisguisedly\nran from the wrath of a Pike, with a pretty girl looking on (to say\nnothing of the acrid Arp, who will fling the legend on a thousand\nwinds), might well agonize you now, as, in less hasty moments and at a\nsafe distance, you brood upon the piteous figure you cut.  On the\ncontrary, behold: you see no blood crimsoning the edges of the horrid\ngash in your panoply of self-esteem: you but smart and scratch the\nscratches, forgetting your wound in the hot itch for vengeance.  It is\nan itch which will last (for in such matters your temper shall be\nsteadfast), and let the great Goliath in the mean time beware of you!\nYou ran, last night.  You ran--of course you ran.  Why not?  You ran to\nfight another day!\n\nA bank clerk sometimes has opportunities.\n\nThe stricken fat one could not understand how it came about that he had\nblurted out the damning confession that he had visited Beaver Beach.\nWhen he tried to solve the puzzle, his mind refused the strain, became\nfoggy and the terrors of his position acute.  Was he, like Joe Louden,\nto endure the ban of Canaan, and like him stand excommunicate beyond\nthe pale because of Martin Pike's displeasure?  For Norbert saw with\nperfect clearness to-day what the Judge had done for Joe. Now that he\nstood in danger of a fate identical, this came home to him.  How many\nothers, he wondered, would do as Mamie had done and write notes such as\nhe had received by the hand of Sam Warden, late last night?\n\n\n\"DEAR SIR.\"  (This from Mamie, who, in the Canaanitish way, had been\nwont to address him as \"Norb\"!)--\"My father wishes me to state that\nafter your remark yesterday afternoon on the steps which was overheard\nby my mother who happened to be standing in the hall behind you and\nyour BEHAVIOR to himself later on--he considers it impossible to allow\nyou to call any more or to speak to any member of his household.\n\n               \"Yours respectfully,\n                                 \"MAMIE PIKE.\"\n\n\nErasures and restorations bore witness to a considerable doubt in\nMamie's mind concerning \"Yours respectfully,\" but she had finally let\nit stand, evidently convinced that the plain signature, without\npreface, savored of an intimacy denied by the context.\n\n\"'DEAR SIR'!\" repeated Norbert, between set teeth.  \"'IMPOSSIBLE TO\nALLOW YOU TO CALL any more'!\" These and other terms of his dismissal\nrecurred to him during the morning, and ever and anon he looked up from\nhis desk, his lips moving to the tune of those horrid phrases, and\nstared out at the street. Basilisk glaring this, with no Christian\nsoftness in it, not even when it fell upon his own grandfather, sitting\namong the sages within easy eye-shot from the big window at Norbert's\nelbow.  However, Colonel Flitcroft was not disturbed by the gaze of his\ndescendant, being, in fact, quite unaware of it.  The aged men were\nhaving a busy morning.\n\nThe conclave was not what it had been.  [See Arp and all his works.]\nThere had come, as the years went by, a few recruits; but faces were\nmissing: the two Tabors had gone, and Uncle Joe Davey could no longer\nlay claim to the patriarchship; he had laid it down with a half-sigh\nand gone his way. Eskew himself was now the oldest of the conscript\nfathers, the Colonel and Squire Buckalew pressing him closely, with\nPeter Bradbury no great time behind.\n\nTo-day they did not plant their feet upon the brass rail inside the\nhotel windows, but courted the genial weather out-doors, and, as their\nsummer custom was, tilted back their chairs in the shade of the western\nwall of the building.\n\n\"And who could of dreamed,\" Mr. Bradbury was saying, with a side-glance\nof expectancy at Eskew, \"that Jonas Tabor would ever turn out to have a\nniece like that!\"\n\nMr. Arp ceased to fan himself with his wide straw hat and said grimly:\n\n\"I don't see as Jonas HAS 'turned out'--not in particular!  If he's\nturned at all, lately, I reckon it's in his grave, and I'll bet he HAS\nif he had any way of hearin' how much she must of spent for clothes!\"\n\n\"I believe,\" Squire Buckalew began, \"that young folks' memories are\nshort.\"\n\n\"They're lucky!\" interjected Eskew.  \"The shorter your memory the less\nmeanness you know.\"\n\n\"I meant young folks don't remember as well as older people do,\"\ncontinued the Squire.  \"I don't see what's so remarkable in her comin'\nback and walkin' up-street with Joe Louden.  She used to go kitin'\nround with him all the time, before she left here.  And yet everybody\ntalks as if they never HEARD of sech a thing!\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Colonel Flitcroft, hesitatingly, \"that she did\nright.  I know it sounds kind of a queer thing to say, and I stirred up\na good deal of opposition at home, yesterday evening, by sort of\nmentioning something of the kind.  Nobody seemed to agree with me,\nexcept Norbert, and he didn't SAY much, but--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by an uncontrollable cackle which issued from the\nmouth of Mr. Arp.  The Colonel turned upon him with a frown, inquiring\nthe cause of his mirth.\n\n\"It put me in mind,\" Mr. Arp began promptly, \"of something that\nhappened last night.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\nEskew's mouth was open to tell, but he remembered, just in time, that\nthe grandfather of Norbert was not the audience properly to be selected\nfor this recital, choked a half-born word, coughed loudly, realizing\nthat he must withhold the story of the felling of Martin Pike until the\nColonel had taken his departure, and replied:\n\n\"Nothin' to speak of.  Go on with your argument.\"\n\n\"I've finished,\" said the Colonel.  \"I only wanted to say that it seems\nto me a good action for a young lady like that to come back here and\nstick to her old friend and playmate.\"\n\n\"STICK to him!\" echoed Mr. Arp.  \"She walked up Main Street with him\nyesterday.  Do you call that stickin' to him?  She's been away a good\nwhile; she's forgotten what Canaan IS.  You wait till she sees for\nherself jest what his standing in this com--\"\n\n\"I agree with Eskew for once,\" interrupted Peter Bradbury.  \"I agree\nbecause--\"\n\n\"Then you better wait,\" cried Eskew, allowing him to proceed no\nfarther, \"till you hear what you're agreein' to!  I say: you take a\nyoung lady like that, pretty and rich and all cultured up, and it\nstands to reason that she won't--\"\n\n\"No, it don't,\" exclaimed Buckalew, impatiently. \"Nothing of the sort!\nI tell you--\"\n\nEskew rose to his feet and pounded the pavement with his stick.  \"It\nstands to reason that she won't stick to a man no other decent woman\nwill speak to, a feller that's been the mark for every stone throwed in\nthe town, ever since he was a boy, an outcast with a reputation as\nblack as a preacher's shoes on Sunday!  I don't care if he's her oldest\nfriend on EARTH, she won't stick to him!  She walked with him\nyesterday, but you can mark my words: his goose is cooked!\"  The old\nman's voice rose, shrill and high.  \"It ain't in human nature fer her\nto do it! You hear what I say: you'll never see her with Joe Louden\nagain in this livin' world, and she as good as told me so, herself,\nlast night.  You can take your oath she's quit him already!  Don't--\"\n\nEskew paused abruptly, his eyes widening behind his spectacles; his jaw\nfell; his stick, raised to hammer the pavement, remained suspended in\nthe air.  A sudden color rushed over his face, and he dropped\nspeechless in his chair.  The others, after staring at him in momentary\nalarm, followed the direction of his gaze.\n\nJust across Main Street, and in plain view, was the entrance to the\nstairway which led to Joe's office. Ariel Tabor, all in cool gray,\ncarrying a big bunch of white roses in her white-gloved hands, had just\ncrossed the sidewalk from a carriage and was ascending the dark\nstairway.  A moment later she came down again, empty-handed, got into\nthe carriage, and drove away.\n\n\"She missed him,\" said Squire Buckalew.  \"I saw him go out half an hour\nago.  BUT,\" he added, and, exercising a self-restraint close upon the\nsaintly, did not even glance toward the heap which was Mr. Arp, \"I\nnotice she left her flowers!\"\n\n\nAriel was not the only one who climbed the dingy stairs that day and\nread the pencilled script upon Joe's door:  \"Will not return until\nevening.  J. Louden.\"  Many others came, all exceedingly unlike the\nfirst visitor: some were quick and watchful, dodging into the narrow\nentrance furtively; some smiled contemptuously as long as they were in\nview of the street, drooping wanly as they reached the stairs: some\nwere brazen and amused; and some were thin and troubled.  Not all of\nthem read the message, for not all could read, but all looked curiously\nthrough the half-opened door at the many roses which lifted their heads\ndelicately from a water-pitcher on Joe's desk to scent that dusty place\nwith their cool breath.\n\nMost of these clients, after a grunt of disappointment, turned and went\naway; though there were a few, either unable to read the message or so\npressed by anxiety that they disregarded it, who entered the room and\nsat down to wait for the absentee.  [There were plenty of chairs in the\noffice now, bookcases also, and a big steel safe.] But when evening\ncame and the final gray of twilight had vanished from the window-panes,\nall had gone except one, a woman who sat patiently, her eyes upon the\nfloor, and her hands folded in her lap, until the footsteps of the last\nof the others to depart had ceased to sound upon the pavement below.\nThen, with a wordless exclamation, she sprang to her feet, pulled the\nwindow-shade carefully down to the sill, and, when she had done that,\nstruck a match on the heel of her shoe--a soiled white canvas shoe, not\na small one--and applied the flame to a gas jet.  The yellow light\nflared up; and she began to pace the room haggardly.\n\nThe court-house bell rang nine, and as the tremors following the last\nstroke pulsed themselves into silence, she heard a footfall on the\nstairs and immediately relapsed into a chair, folding her hands again\nin her lap, her expression composing itself to passivity, for the step\nwas very much lighter than Joe's.\n\nA lady beautifully dressed in white dimity appeared in the doorway.\nShe hesitated at the threshold, not, apparently, because of any\ntimidity (her expression being too thoughtfully assured for that), but\nalmost immediately she came in and seated herself near the desk,\nacknowledging the other's presence by a slight inclination of the head.\n\nThis grave courtesy caused a strong, deep flush to spread itself under\nthe rouge which unevenly covered the woman's cheeks, as she bowed\nelaborately in return.  Then, furtively, during a protracted silence,\nshe took stock of the new-comer, from the tip of her white suede shoes\nto the filmy lace and pink roses upon her wide white hat; and the\nsidelong gaze lingered marvellingly upon the quiet, delicate hands,\nslender and finely expressive, in their white gloves.\n\nHer own hands, unlike the lady's, began to fidget confusedly, and, the\nsilence continuing, she coughed several times, to effect the preface\nrequired by her sense of fitness, before she felt it proper to observe,\nwith a polite titter:\n\n\"Mr. Louden seems to be a good while comin'.\"\n\n\"Have you been waiting very long?\" asked the lady.\n\n\"Ever since six o'clock!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other.  \"That is very long.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, it cert'nly is.\"  The ice thus broken, she felt free to\nuse her eyes more directly, and, after a long, frank stare, exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, you must be Miss Ariel Tabor, ain't you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  Ariel touched one of the roses upon Joe's desk with her\nfinger-tips.  \"I am Miss Tabor.\"\n\n\"Well, excuse me fer asking; I'm sure it ain't any business of mine,\"\nsaid the other, remembering the manners due one lady from another.\n\"But I thought it must be.  I expect,\" she added, with loud,\ninconsequent laughter, \"there's not many in Canaan ain't heard you've\ncome back.\"  She paused, laughed again, nervously, and again, less\nloudly, to take off the edge of her abruptness: gradually tittering\nherself down to a pause, to fill which she put forth:  \"Right nice\nweather we be'n havin'.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ariel.\n\n\"It was rainy, first of last week, though.  _I_ don't mind rain so\nmuch\"--this with more laughter,--\"I stay in the house when it rains.\nSome people don't know enough to, they say!  You've heard that saying,\nain't you, Miss Tabor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I tell YOU,\" she exclaimed, noisily, \"there's plenty ladies and\ngen'lemen in this town that's like that!\"\n\nHer laughter did not cease; it became louder and shriller.  It had\nbeen, until now, a mere lubrication of the conversation, helping to\nmake her easier in Miss Tabor's presence, but as it increased in\nshrillness, she seemed to be losing control of herself, as if her\nlaughter were getting away with her; she was not far from hysteria,\nwhen it stopped with a gasp, and she sat up straight in her chair,\nwhite and rigid.\n\n\"THERE!\" she said, listening intently.  \"Ain't that him?\"  Steps\nsounded upon the pavement below; paused for a second at the foot of the\nstairs; there was the snap of a match; then the steps sounded again,\nretreating.  She sank back in her chair limply.  \"It was only some one\nstoppin' to light his cigar in the entry.  It wasn't Joe Louden's step,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"You know his step?\" Ariel's eyes were bent upon the woman wonderingly.\n\n\"I'd know it to-night,\" was the answer, delivered with a sharp and\npainful giggle.  \"I got plenty reason to!\"\n\nAriel did not respond.  She leaned a little closer to the roses upon\nthe desk, letting them touch her face, and breathing deeply of their\nfragrance to neutralize a perfume which pervaded the room; an odor as\nheavy and cheap-sweet as the face of the woman who had saturated her\nhandkerchief with it, a scent which went with her perfectly and made\nher unhappily definite; suited to her clumsily dyed hair, to her soiled\nwhite shoes, to the hot red hat smothered in plumage, to the restless\nstub-fingered hands, to the fat, plated rings, of which she wore a\ngreat quantity, though, surprisingly enough, the large diamonds in her\nears were pure, and of a very clear water.\n\nIt was she who broke the silence once more. \"Well,\" she drawled,\ncoughing genteelly at the same time, \"better late than never, as the\nsaying is.  I wonder who it is gits up all them comical sayings?\"\nApparently she had no genuine desire for light upon this mystery, as\nshe continued, immediately:  \"I have a gen'leman friend that's always\ngittin' 'em off.  'Well,' he says, 'the best of friends must part,'\nand, 'Thou strikest me to the heart'--all kinds of cracks like that.\nHe's real comical.  And yet,\" she went on in an altered voice, \"I don't\nlike him much.  I'd be glad if I'd never seen him.\"\n\nThe change of tone was so marked that Ariel looked at her keenly, to\nfind herself surprised into pitying this strange client of Joe's; for\ntears had sprung to the woman's eyes and slid along the lids, where she\ntried vainly to restrain them.  Her face had altered too, like her\nvoice, haggard lines suddenly appearing about the eyes and mouth as if\nthey had just been pencilled there: the truth issuing from beneath her\npinchbeck simulations, like a tragic mask revealed by the displacement\nof a tawdry covering.\n\n\"I expect you think I'm real foolish,\" she said, \"but I be'n waitin' so\nawful long--and I got a good deal of worry on my mind till I see Mr.\nLouden.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Ariel turned from the roses, and faced her and the heavy\nperfume.  \"I hope he will come soon.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said the other.  \"It's something to do with me that keeps\nhim away, and the longer he is the more it scares me.\"  She shivered\nand set her teeth together.  \"It's kind of hard, waitin'.  I cert'nly\ngot my share of troubles.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that Mr. Louden will be able to take care of them for\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, I HOPE so, Miss Tabor!  If he can't, nobody can.\"  She was crying\nopenly now, wiping her eyes with her musk-soaked handkerchief.  \"We had\nto send fer him yesterday afternoon--\"\n\n\"To come to Beaver Beach, do you mean?\" asked Ariel, leaning forward.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.  It all begun out there,--least-ways it begun before that\nwith me.  It was all my fault.  I deserve all that's comin' to me, I\nguess.  I done wrong--I done wrong!  I'd oughtn't never to of went out\nthere yesterday.\"\n\nShe checked herself sharply, but, after a moment's pause, continued,\nencouraged by the grave kindliness of the delicate face in the shadow\nof the wide white hat.  \"I'd oughtn't to of went,\" she repeated.  \"Oh,\nI reckon I'll never, never learn enough to keep out o' trouble, even\nwhen I see it comin'!  But that gentleman friend of mine--Mr. Nashville\nCory's his name--he kind o' coaxed me into it, and he's right comical\nwhen he's with ladies, and he's good company--and he says, 'Claudine,\nwe'll dance the light fantastic,' he says, and I kind o' wanted\nsomething cheerful--I'd be'n workin' steady quite a spell, and it\nlooked like he wanted to show me a good time, so I went, and that's\nwhat started it.\"  Now that she had begun, she babbled on with her\nstory, at times incoherently; full of excuses, made to herself more\nthan to Ariel, pitifully endeavoring to convince herself that the\nresponsibility for the muddle she had made was not hers.\n\n\"Mr. Cory told me my husband was drinkin' and wouldn't know about it,\nand, 'Besides,' he says, 'what's the odds?'  Of course I knowed there\nwas trouble between him and Mr. Fear--that's my husband--a good while\nago, when Mr. Fear up and laid him out.  That was before me and Mr.\nFear got married; I hadn't even be'n to Canaan then; I was on the\nstage.  I was on the stage quite a while in Chicago before I got\nacquainted with my husband.\"\n\n\"You were on the stage?\" Ariel exclaimed, involuntarily.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.  Livin' pitchers at Goldberg's Rat'skeller, and amunchoor\nnights I nearly always done a sketch with a gen'leman friend.  That's\nthe way I met Mr. Fear; he seemed to be real struck with me right away,\nand soon as I got through my turn he ast me to order whatever I wanted.\nHe's always gen'lemanlike when he ain't had too much, and even then he\nvurry, vurry seldom acks rough unless he's jealous.  That was the\ntrouble yesterday. I never would of gone to the Beach if I'd dreamed\nwhat was comin'!  When we got there I saw Mike--that's the gen'leman\nthat runs the Beach--lookin' at my company and me kind of anxious, and\npretty soon he got me away from Mr. Cory and told me what's what.\nSeems this Cory only wanted me to go with him to make my husband mad,\nand he'd took good care that Mr. Fear heard I'd be there with him!  And\nhe'd be'n hangin' around me, every time he struck town, jest to make\nMr. Fear mad--the fresh thing!  You see he wanted to make my husband\nstart something again, this Mr. Cory did, and he was fixed for it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Ariel.\n\n\"It's this way: if Mr. Fear attacted Mr. Cory, why, Mr. Cory could\nshoot him down and claim self-defence.  You see, it would be easy for\nMr. Cory, because Mr Fear nearly killed him when they had their first\ntrouble, and that would give Mr. Cory a good excuse to shoot if Mr.\nFear jest only pushed him.  That's the way it is with the law.  Mr.\nCory could wipe out their old score and git off scot-free.\"\n\n\"Surely not!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that's the way it would be.  And when Mike told me that\nMr. Cory had got me out there jest to provoke my husband I went\nstraight up to him and begun to give him a piece of my mind. I didn't\ntalk loud, because I never was one to make a disturbance and start\ntrouble the way SOME do; and right while I was talkin' we both see my\nhusband pass the window.  Mr. Cory give a kind of yelling laugh and put\nhis arm round me jest as Mr. Fear come in the door.  And then it all\nhappened so quick that you could hardly tell what WAS goin' on.  Mr.\nFear, we found afterwards, had promised Mr. Louden that he wouldn't\ncome out there, but he took too much--you could see that by the look of\nhim--and fergot his promise; fergot everything but me and Cory, I guess.\n\n\"He come right up to us, where I was tryin' to git away from Cory's\narm--it was the left one he had around me, and the other behind his\nback--and neither of 'em said a word.  Cory kept on laughin' loud as he\ncould, and Mr. Fear struck him in the mouth.  He's little, but he can\nhit awful hard, and Mr. Cory let out a screech, and I see his gun go\noff--right in Mr. Fear's face, I thought, but it wasn't; it only\nscorched him.  Most of the other gen'lemen had run, but Mike made a\ndive and managed to knock the gun to one side, jest barely in time.\nThen Mike and three or four others that come out from behind things\nseparated 'em--both of 'em fightin' to git at each other.  They locked\nMr. Cory up in Mike's room, and took Mr. Fear over to where they hitch\nthe horses.  Then Mike sent fer Mr. Louden to come out to talk to my\nhusband and take care of him--he's the only one can do anything with\nhim when he's like that--but before Mr. Louden could git there, Mr.\nFear broke loose and run through a corn-field and got away; at least\nthey couldn't find him.  And Mr. Cory jumped through a window and slid\ndown into one of Mike's boats, so they'd both gone.  When Mr. Louden\ncome, he only stayed long enough to hear what had happened and started\nout to find Happy--that's my husband. He's bound to keep them apart,\nbut he hasn't found Mr. Fear yet or he'd be here.\"\n\nAriel had sunk back in her chair.  \"Why should your husband hide?\" she\nasked, in a low voice.\n\n\"Waitin' fer his chance at Cory,\" the woman answered, huskily.  \"I\nexpect he's afraid the cops are after him, too, on account of the\ntrouble, and he doesn't want to git locked up till he's met Cory again.\nThey ain't after him, but he may not know it.  They haven't heard of\nthe trouble, I reckon, or they'd of run Cory in.  HE'S around town\nto-day, drinkin' heavy, and I guess he's lookin' fer Mr. Fear about as\nhard as Mr. Louden is.\"  She rose to her feet, lifted her coarse hands,\nand dropped them despairingly.  \"Oh, I'm scared!\" she said.  \"Mr.\nFear's be'n mighty good to me.\"\n\nA slow and tired footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Joe's dog ran\ninto the room droopingly, wagged his tail with no energy, and crept\nunder the desk.  Mrs. Fear wheeled toward the door and stood, rigid,\nher hands clenched tight, her whole body still, except her breast,\nwhich rose and fell with her tumultuous breathing.  She could not wait\ntill the laggard step reached the landing.\n\n\"MR. LOUDEN!\" she called, suddenly.\n\nJoe's voice came from the stairway.  \"It's all right, Claudine.  It's\nall fixed up.  Don't worry.\"\n\nMrs. Fear gave a thick cry of relief and sank back in her chair as Joe\nentered the room.  He came in shamblingly, with his hand over his eyes\nas if they were very tired and the light hurt them, so that, for a\nmoment or two, he did not perceive the second visitor.  Then he let his\nhand fall, revealing a face very white and worn.\n\n\"It's all right, Claudine,\" he repeated.  \"It's all right.\"\n\nHe was moving to lay his hat on the desk when his eye caught first the\nroses, then fell upon Ariel, and he stopped stock-still with one arm\noutstretched, remaining for perhaps ten seconds in that attitude, while\nshe, her lips parted, her eyes lustrous, returned his gaze with a look\nthat was as inscrutable as it was kind.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, as if in answer to a question, \"I have come here twice\nto-day.\"  She nodded slightly toward Mrs. Fear.  \"I can wait.  I am\nvery glad you bring good news.\"\n\nJoe turned dazedly toward the other.  \"Claudine,\" he said, \"you've been\ntelling Miss Tabor.\"\n\n\"I cert'nly have!\" Mrs. Fear's expression had cleared and her tone was\ncheerful.  \"I don't see no harm in that!  I'm sure she's a good friend\nof YOURS, Mr. Louden.\"\n\nJoe glanced at Ariel with a faint, troubled smile, and turned again to\nMrs. Fear.  \"I've had a long talk with Happy.\"\n\n\"I'm awful glad.  Is he ready to listen to reason? she asked, with a\ntitter.\n\n\"He's waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Where?\"  She rose quickly.\n\n\"Stop,\" said Joe, sharply.  \"You must be very careful with him--\"\n\n\"Don't you s'pose I'm goin' to be?\" she interrupted, with a catch in\nher voice.  \"Don't you s'pose I've had trouble enough?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Joe, deliberately and impersonally, \"I don't.  Unless you\nkeep remembering to be careful all the time, you'll follow the first\nimpulse you have, as you did yesterday, and your excuse will be that\nyou never thought any harm would come of it.  He's in a queer mood; but\nhe will forgive you if you ask him--\"\n\n\"Well, ain't that what I WANT to do!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" he said, dropping into the desk-chair and passing his\nhand over his eyes with a gesture of infinite weariness.  \"But you must\nbe very careful.  I hunted for him most of the night and all day.  He\nwas trying to keep out of my way because he didn't want me to find him\nuntil he had met this fellow Nashville.  Happy is a hard man to come at\nwhen he doesn't care to be found, and he kept shifting from place to\nplace until I ran him down.  Then I got him in a corner and told him\nthat you hadn't meant any harm--which is always true of you, poor\nwoman!--and I didn't leave him till he had promised me to forgive you\nif you would come and ask him.  And you must keep him out of Cory's way\nuntil I can arrange to have him--Cory, I mean--sent out of town.  Will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Why, cert'nly,\" she answered, smiling.  \"That Nashville's the vurry\nlast person I ever want to see again--the fresh thing!\" Mrs. Fear's\nburden had fallen; her relief was perfect and she beamed vapidly; but\nJoe marked her renewed irresponsibility with an anxious eye.\n\n\"You mustn't make any mistakes,\" he said, rising stiffly with fatigue.\n\n\"Not ME!  _I_ don't take no more chances,\" she responded, tittering\nhappily.  \"Not after yesterday. MY! but it's a load off my shoulders!\nI do hate it to have gen'lemen quarrelling over me, especially Mr.\nFear.  I never DID like to START anything; I like to see people laugh\nand be friendly, and I'm mighty glad it's all blown over.  I kind o'\nthought it would, all along.  PSHO!\" She burst into genuine, noisy\nlaughter.  \"I don't expect either of 'em meant no real harm to each\nother, after they got cooled off a little!  If they'd met to-day,\nthey'd probably both run!  Now, Mr. Louden, where's Happy?\"\n\nJoe went to the door with her.  He waited a moment, perplexed, then his\nbrow cleared and he said in a low voice:  \"You know the alley beyond\nVent Miller's pool-room?  Go down the alley till you come to the second\ngate.  Go in, and you'll see a basement door opening into a little room\nunder Miller's bar.  The door won't be locked, and Happy's in there\nwaiting for you.  But remember--\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you worry,\" she cut him off, loudly. \"I know HIM!  Inside of\nan hour I'll have him LAUGHIN' over all this.  You'll see!\"\n\nWhen she had gone, he stood upon the landing looking thoughtfully after\nher.  \"Perhaps, after all, that is the best mood to let her meet him\nin,\" he murmured.\n\nThen, with a deep breath, he turned.  The heavy perfume had gone; the\nair was clear and sweet, and Ariel was pressing her face into the roses\nagain.  As he saw how like them she was, he was shaken with a profound\nand mysterious sigh, like that which moves in the breast of one who\nlistens in the dark to his dearest music.\n\n\n\nXV\n\nHAPPY FEAR GIVES HIMSELF UP\n\n\"I know how tired you are,\" said Ariel, as he came back into the room.\n\"I shall not keep you long.\"\n\n\"Ah, please do!\" he returned, quickly, beginning to fumble with the\nshade of a student-lamp at one end of the desk.\n\n\"Let me do that,\" she said.  \"Sit down.\"  He obeyed at once, and\nwatched her as she lit the lamp, and, stretching upon tiptoe, turned\nout the gas. \"No,\" she continued, seated again and looking across the\ndesk at him, \"I wanted to see you at the first possible opportunity,\nbut what I have to say--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" he interrupted.  \"Let me tell you why I did not come yesterday.\"\n\n\"You need not tell me.  I know.\"  She glanced at the chair which had\nbeen occupied by Mrs. Fear. \"I knew last night that they had sent for\nyou.\"\n\n\"You did?\" he exclaimed.  \"Ah, I understand. Sam Warden must have told\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"It was he; and I have been wondering ever since how\nhe heard of it.  He knew last night, but there was nothing in the\npapers this morning; and until I came here I heard no one else speak of\nit; yet Canaan is not large.\"\n\nJoe laughed.  \"It wouldn't seem strange if you lived with the Canaan\nthat I do.  Sam had been down-town during the afternoon and had met\nfriends; the colored people are a good deal like a freemasonry, you\nknow.  A great many knew last night all about what had happened, and\nhad their theories about what might happen to-day in case the two men\nmet.  Still, you see, those who knew, also knew just what people not to\ntell.  The Tocsin is the only newspaper worth the name here; but even\nif the Tocsin had known of the trouble, it wouldn't have been likely to\nmention it.  That's a thing I don't understand.\"  He frowned and rubbed\nthe back of his head.  \"There's something underneath it.  For more than\na year the Tocsin hasn't spoken of Beaver Beach.  I'd like to know why.\"\n\n\"Joe,\" she said, slowly, \"tell me something truly.  A man said to me\nyesterday that he found life here insufferable.  Do you find it so?\"\n\n\"Why, no!\" he answered, surprised.\n\n\"Do you hate Canaan?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"You don't find it dull, provincial, unsympathetic?\"\n\nHe laughed cheerily.  \"Well, there's this,\" he explained:  \"I have an\nadvantage over your friend. I see a more interesting side of things\nprobably. The people I live among are pretty thorough cosmopolites in a\nway, and the life I lead--\"\n\n\"I think I begin to understand a little about the life you lead,\" she\ninterrupted.  \"Then you don't complain of Canaan?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nShe threw him a quick, bright, happy look, then glanced again at the\nchair in which Mrs. Fear had sat.  \"Joe,\" she said, \"last night I heard\nthe people singing in the houses, the old Sunday-evening way.  It 'took\nme back so'!\"\n\n\"Yes, it would.  And something else: there's one hymn they sing more\nthan any other; it's Canaan's favorite.  Do you know what it is?\"\n\n\"Is it 'Rescue the Perishing'?\"\n\n\"That's it.  'Rescue the Perishing'!\" he cried, and repeating the words\nagain, gave forth a peal of laughter so hearty that it brought tears to\nhis eyes.  \"'RESCUE THE PERISHING'!\"\n\nAt first she did not understand his laughter, but, after a moment, she\ndid, and joined her own to it, though with a certain tremulousness.\n\n\"It IS funny, isn't it?\" said Joe, wiping the moisture from his eyes.\nThen all trace of mirth left him.  \"Is it really YOU, sitting here and\nlaughing with me, Ariel?\"\n\n\"It seems to be,\" she answered, in a low voice. \"I'm not at all sure.\"\n\n\"You didn't think, yesterday afternoon,\" he began, almost in a\nwhisper,--\"you didn't think that I had failed to come because I--\"  He\ngrew very red, and shifted the sentence awkwardly:  \"I was afraid you\nmight think that I was--that I didn't come because I might have been\nthe same way again that I was when--when I met you at the station?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she answered, gently.  \"No.  I knew better.\"\n\n\"And do you know,\" he faltered, \"that that is all over?  That it can\nnever happen again?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it,\" she returned, quickly.\n\n\"Then you know a little of what I owe you.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she protested.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.  \"You've made that change in me already.  It wasn't\nhard--it won't be--though it might have been if--if you hadn't come\nsoon.\"\n\n\"Tell me something,\" she demanded.  \"If these people had not sent for\nyou yesterday, would you have come to Judge Pike's house to see me?\nYou said you would try.\"  She laughed a little, and looked away from\nhim.  \"I want to know if you would have come.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and in spite of her averted glance she knew that\nhe was looking at her steadily. Finally, \"Don't you know?\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head and blushed faintly.\n\n\"Don't you know?\" he repeated.\n\nShe looked up and met his eyes, and thereupon both became very grave.\n\"Yes, I do,\" she answered.  \"You would have come.  When you left me at\nthe gate and went away, you were afraid. But you would have come.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I'd have come.  You are right.  I was afraid at first; but I\nknew,\" he went on, rapidly, \"that you would have come to the gate to\nmeet me.\"\n\n\"You understood that?\" she cried, her eyes sparkling and her face\nflushing happily.\n\n\"Yes.  I knew that you wouldn't have asked me to come,\" he said, with a\ncatch in his voice which was half chuckle, half groan, \"if you hadn't\nmeant to take care of me!  And it came to me that you would know how to\ndo it.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her chair, and again they laughed together, but only\nfor a moment, becoming serious and very quiet almost instantly.\n\n\"I haven't thanked you for the roses,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh yes, you did.  When you first looked at them!\"\n\n\"So I did,\" he whispered.  \"I'm glad you saw. To find them here took my\nbreath away--and to find you with them--\"\n\n\"I brought them this morning, you know.\"\n\n\"Would you have come if you had not understood why I failed yesterday?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I think so,\" she returned, the fine edge of a smile upon her\nlips.  \"For a time last evening, before I heard what had happened, I\nthought you were too frightened a friend to bother about.\"\n\nHe made a little ejaculation, partly joyful, partly sad.\n\n\"And yet,\" she went on, \"I think that I should have come this morning,\nafter all, even if you had a poorer excuse for your absence, because,\nyou see, I came on business.\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"That's why I've come again.  That makes it respectable for me to be\nhere now, doesn't it?--for me to have come out alone after dark without\ntheir knowing it?  I'm here as your client, Joe.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked.\n\nShe did not answer at once, but picked up a pen from beneath her hand\non the desk, and turning it, meditatively felt its point with her\nforefinger before she said slowly, \"Are most men careful of other\npeople's--well, of other people's money?\"\n\n\"You mean Martin Pike?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.  I want you to take charge of everything I have for me.\"\n\nHe bent a frowning regard upon the lamp-shade. \"You ought to look after\nyour own property,\" he said.  \"You surely have plenty of time.\"\n\n\"You mean--you mean you won't help me?\" she returned, with intentional\npathos.\n\n\"Ariel!\" he laughed, shortly, in answer; then asked, \"What makes you\nthink Judge Pike isn't trustworthy?\"\n\n\"Nothing very definite perhaps, unless it was his look when I told him\nthat I meant to ask you to take charge of things for me.\"\n\n\"He's been rather hard pressed this year, I think,\" said Joe.  \"You\nmight be right--if he could have found a way.  I hope he hasn't.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" she began, gayly, \"that I know very little of my own\naffairs.  He sent me a draft every three months, with receipts and\nother things to sign and return to him.  I haven't the faintest notion\nof what I own--except the old house and some money from the income that\nI hadn't used and brought with me.  Judge Pike has all the\npapers--everything.\"\n\nJoe looked troubled.  \"And Roger Tabor, did he--\"\n\n\"The dear man!\" She shook her head.  \"He was just the same.  To him\npoor Uncle Jonas's money seemed to come from heaven through the hands\nof Judge Pike--\"\n\n\"And there's a handsome roundabout way!\" said Joe.\n\n\"Wasn't it!\" she agreed, cheerfully.  \"And he trusted the Judge\nabsolutely.  I don't, you see.\"\n\nHe gave her a thoughtful look and nodded. \"No, he isn't a good man,\" he\nsaid, \"not even according to his lights; but I doubt if he could have\nmanaged to get away with anything of consequence after he became the\nadministrator.  He wouldn't have tried it, probably, unless he was more\ndesperately pushed than I think he has been. It would have been too\ndangerous.  Suppose you wait a week or so and think it over.\"\n\n\"But there's something I want you to do for me immediately, Joe.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"I want the old house put in order.  I'm going to live there.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"I'm almost twenty-seven, and that's being enough of an old maid for me\nto risk Canaan's thinking me eccentric, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It will think anything you do is all right.\"\n\n\"And once,\" she cried, \"it thought everything I did all wrong!\"\n\n\"Yes.  That's the difference.\"\n\n\"You mean it will commend me because I'm thought rich?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, meditatively, \"it isn't that. It's because everybody\nwill be in love with you.\"\n\n\"Quite everybody!\" she asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied.  \"Anybody who didn't would be absurd.\"\n\n\"Ah, Joe!\" she laughed.  \"You always were the nicest boy in the world,\nmy dear!\"\n\nAt that he turned toward her with a sudden movement and his lips\nparted, but not to speak. She had rested one arm upon the desk, and her\ncheek upon her hand; the pen she had picked up, still absently held in\nher fingers, touching her lips; and it was given to him to know that he\nwould always keep that pen, though he would never write with it again.\nThe soft lamplight fell across the lower part of her face, leaving her\neyes, which were lowered thoughtfully, in the shadow of her hat.  The\nroom was blotted out in darkness behind her.  Like the background of an\nantique portrait, the office, with its dusty corners and shelves and\nhideous safe, had vanished, leaving the charming and thoughtful face\nrevealed against an even, spacious brownness.  Only Ariel and the roses\nand the lamp were clear; and a strange, small pain moved from Joe's\nheart to his throat, as he thought that this ugly office, always before\nso harsh and grim and lonely--loneliest for him when it had been most\ncrowded,--was now transfigured into something very, very different from\nan office; that this place where he sat, with a lamp and flowers on a\ndesk between him and a woman who called him \"my dear,\" must be\nlike--like something that people called \"home.\"\n\nAnd then he leaned across the desk toward her, as he said again what he\nhad said a little while before,--and his voice trembled:\n\n\"Ariel, it IS you?\"\n\nShe looked at him and smiled.\n\n\"You'll be here always, won't you?  You're not going away from Canaan\nagain?\"\n\nFor a moment it seemed that she had not heard him.  Then her bright\nglance at him wavered and fell.  She rose, turning slightly away from\nhim, but not so far that he could not see the sudden agitation in her\nface.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried, rising too, \"I don't want you to think I don't\nunderstand, or that I meant _I_ should ever ask you to stay here!  I\ncouldn't mean that; you know I couldn't, don't you?  You know I\nunderstand that it's all just your beautiful friendliness, don't you?\"\n\n\"It isn't beautiful; it's just ME, Joe,\" she said. \"It couldn't be any\nother way.\"\n\n\"It's enough that you should be here now,\" he went on, bravely, his\nvoice steady, though his hand shook.  \"Nothing so wonderful as your\nstaying could ever actually happen.  It's just a light coming into a\ndark room and out again.  One day, long ago--I never forgot it--some\napple-blossoms blew by me as I passed an orchard; and it's like that,\ntoo.  But, oh, my dear, when you go you'll leave a fragrance in my\nheart that will last!\"\n\nShe turned toward him, her face suffused with a rosy light.  \"You'd\nrather have died than have said that to me once,\" she cried.  \"I'm glad\nyou're weak enough now to confess it!\"\n\nHe sank down again into his chair and his arms fell heavily on the\ndesk.  \"Confess it!\" he cried, despairingly.  \"And you don't deny that\nyou're going away again--so it's true!  I wish I hadn't realized it so\nsoon.  I think I'd rather have tried to fool myself about it a little\nlonger!\"\n\n\"Joe,\" she cried, in a voice of great pain, \"you mustn't feel like\nthat!  How do you know I'm going away again?  Why should I want the old\nhouse put in order unless I mean to stay?  And if I went, you know that\nI could never change; you know how I've always cared for you--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I do know how.  It was always the same and it always\nwill be, won't it?\"\n\n\"I've shown that,\" she returned, quickly.\n\n\"Yes.  You say I know how you've cared for me--and I do.  I know HOW.\nIt's just in one certain way--Jonathan and David--\"\n\n\"Isn't that a pretty good way, Joe?\"\n\n\"Never fear that I don't understand!\"  He got to his feet again and\nlooked at her steadily.\n\n\"Thank you, Joe.\"  She wiped sudden tears from her eyes.\n\n\"Don't you be sorry for me,\" he said.  \"Do you think that 'passing the\nlove of women' isn't enough for me?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, humbly.\n\n\"I'll have people at work on the old house to-morrow,\" he began.  \"And\nfor the--\"\n\n\"I've kept you so long!\" she interrupted, helped to a meek sort of\ngayety by his matter-of-fact tone. \"Good-night, Joe.\"  She gave him her\nhand.  \"I don't want you to come with me.  It isn't very late and this\nis Canaan.\"\n\n\"I want to come with you, however,\" he said, picking up his hat.  \"You\ncan't go alone.\"\n\n\"But you are so tired, you--\"\n\nShe was interrupted.  There were muffled, flying footsteps on the\nstairs, and a shabby little man ran furtively into the room, shut the\ndoor behind him, and set his back against it.  His face was mottled\nlike a colored map, thick lines of perspiration shining across the\nsplotches.\n\n\"Joe,\" he panted, \"I've got Nashville good, and he's got me good,\ntoo;--I got to clear out.  He's fixed me good, damn him! but he won't\ntrouble nobody--\"\n\nJoe was across the room like a flying shadow.\n\n\"QUIET!\"  His voice rang like a shot, and on the instant his hand fell\nsharply across the speaker's mouth.  \"In THERE, Happy!\"\n\nHe threw an arm across the little man's shoulders and swung him toward\nthe door of the other room.\n\nHappy Fear looked up from beneath the down-bent brim of his black\nslouch hat; his eyes followed an imperious gesture toward Ariel, gave\nher a brief, ghastly stare, and stumbled into the inner chamber.\n\n\"Wait!\" Joe said, cavalierly, to Ariel.  He went in quickly after Mr.\nFear and closed the door.\n\nThis was Joseph Louden, Attorney-at-Law; and to Ariel it was like a new\nface seen in a flash-light--not at all the face of Joe.  The sense of\nhis strangeness, his unfamiliarity in this electrical aspect, overcame\nher.  She was possessed by astonishment:  Did she know him so well,\nafter all?  The strange client had burst in, shaken beyond belief with\nsome passion unknown to her, but Joe, alert, and masterful beyond\ndenial, had controlled him instantly; had swept him into the other room\nas with a broom.  Could it be that Joe sometimes did other things in\nthe same sweeping fashion?\n\nShe heard a match struck in the next room, and the voices of the two\nmen: Joe's, then the other's, the latter at first broken and\nprotestive, but soon rising shrilly.  She could hear only fragments.\nOnce she heard the client cry, almost scream: \"By God! Joe, I thought\nClaudine had chased him around there to DO me!\"  And, instantly,\nfollowed Louden's voice:\n\n\"STEADY, HAPPY, STEADY!\"\n\nThe name \"Claudine\" startled her; and although she had had no\ncomprehension of the argot of Happy Fear, the sense of a mysterious\ncatastrophe oppressed her; she was sure that something horrible had\nhappened.  She went to the window; touched the shade, which disappeared\nupward immediately, and lifted the sash.  The front of a square\nbuilding in the Court-house Square was bright with lights; and figures\nwere passing in and out of the Main Street doors.  She remembered that\nthis was the jail.\n\n\"Claudine!\"  The voice of the husband of Claudine was like the voice of\none lamenting over Jerusalem.\n\n\"STEADY, HAPPY, STEADY!\"\n\n\"But, Joe, if they git me, what'll she do?  She can't hold her job no\nlonger--not after this....\"\n\nThe door opened, and the two men came out, Joe with his hand on the\nother's shoulder.  The splotches had gone from Happy's face, leaving it\nan even, deathly white.  He did not glance toward Ariel; he gazed far\nbeyond all that was about him; and suddenly she was aware of a great\ntragedy. The little man's chin trembled and he swallowed painfully;\nnevertheless he bore himself upright and dauntlessly as the two walked\nslowly to the door, like men taking part in some fateful ceremony.  Joe\nstopped upon the landing at the head of the stairs, but Happy Fear went\non, clumping heavily down the steps.\n\n\"It's all right, Happy,\" said Joe.  \"It's better for you to go alone.\nDon't you worry.  I'll see you through.  It will be all right.\"\n\n\"Just as YOU say, Joe,\" a breaking voice came back from the foot of the\nsteps,--\"just as YOU say!\"\n\nThe lawyer turned from the landing and went rapidly to the window\nbeside Ariel.  Together they watched the shabby little figure cross the\nstreet below; and she felt an infinite pathos gathering about it as it\npaused for a moment, hesitating, underneath the arc-lamp at the corner.\nThey saw the white face lifted as Happy Fear gave one last look about\nhim; then he set his shoulders sturdily, and steadfastly entered the\ndoor of the jail.\n\nJoe took a deep breath.  \"Now we'll go,\" he said.  \"I must be quick.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" she asked, tremulously, as they reached the street.\n\"Can you tell me?\"\n\n\"Nothing--just an old story.\"\n\nHe had not offered her his arm, but walked on hurriedly, a pace ahead\nof her, though she came as rapidly as she could.  She put her hand\nrather timidly on his sleeve, and without need of more words from her\nhe understood her insistence.\n\n\"That was the husband of the woman who told you her story,\" he said.\n\"Perhaps it would shock you less if I tell you now than if you heard it\nto-morrow, as you will.  He's just shot the other man.\"\n\n\"Killed him!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.  \"He wanted to run away, but I wouldn't let him.\nHe has my word that I'll clear him, and I made him give himself up.\"\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nTHE TWO CANAANS\n\nWhen Joe left Ariel at Judge Pike's gate she lingered there, her elbows\nupon the uppermost cross-bar, like a village girl at twilight, watching\nhis thin figure vanish into the heavy shadow of the maples, then emerge\nmomentarily, ghost-gray and rapid, at the lighted crossing down the\nstreet, to disappear again under the trees beyond, followed a second\nlater by a brownish streak as the mongrel heeled after him.  When they\nhad passed the second corner she could no longer be certain of them,\nalthough the street was straight, with flat, draughtsmanlike Western\ndirectness: both figures and Joe's quick footsteps merging with the\nnight.  Still she did not turn to go; did not alter her position, nor\ncease to gaze down the dim street.  Few lights shone; almost all the\nwindows of the houses were darkened, and, save for the summer murmurs,\nthe faint creak of upper branches, and the infinitesimal voices of\ninsects in the grass, there was silence: the pleasant and somnolent\nhush, swathed in which that part of Canaan crosses to the far side of\nthe eleventh hour.\n\nBut Ariel, not soothed by this balm, sought beyond it, to see that\nunquiet Canaan whither her old friend bent his steps and found his\nlabor and his dwelling: that other Canaan where peace did not fall\ncomfortably with the coming of night; a place as alien in habit, in\nthought, and almost in speech as if it had been upon another continent.\nAnd yet--so strange is the duality of towns--it lay but a few blocks\ndistant.\n\nHere, about Ariel, as she stood at the gate of the Pike Mansion, the\nhouses of the good (secure of salvation and daily bread) were closed\nand quiet, as safely shut and sound asleep as the churches; but deeper\nin the town there was light and life and merry, evil\nindustry,--screened, but strong to last until morning; there were\nhaunts of haggard merriment in plenty: surreptitious chambers where\nroulette-wheels swam beneath dizzied eyes; ill-favored bars, reached by\ndevious ways, where quavering voices offered song and were harshly\nchecked; and through the burdened air of this Canaan wandered heavy\nsmells of musk like that upon Happy Fear's wife, who must now be so\npale beneath her rouge.  And above all this, and for all this, and\nbecause of all this, was that one resort to which Joe now made his way;\nthat haven whose lights burn all night long, whose doors are never\nclosed, but are open from dawn until dawn--the jail.\n\nThere, in that desolate refuge, lay Happy Fear, surrendered sturdily by\nhimself at Joe's word. The picture of the little man was clear and\nfresh in Ariel's eyes, and though she had seen him when he was newly\ncome from a thing so terrible that she could not realize it as a fact,\nshe felt only an overwhelming pity for him.  She was not even\nhorror-stricken, though she had shuddered.  The pathos of the shabby\nlittle figure crossing the street toward the lighted doors had touched\nher.  Something about him had appealed to her, for he had not seemed\nwicked; his face was not cruel, though it was desperate.  Perhaps it\nwas partly his very desperation which had moved her.  She had\nunderstood Joe, when he told her, that this man was his friend; and\ncomprehended his great fear when he said:  \"I've got to clear him!  I\npromised him.\"\n\nOver and over Joe had reiterated:  \"I've got to save him!  I've got\nto!\"  She had answered gently, \"Yes, Joe,\" hurrying to keep up with\nhim. \"He's a good man,\" he said.  \"I've known few better, given his\nchances.  And none of this would have happened except for his old-time\nfriendship for me.  It was his loyalty--oh, the rarest and absurdest\nloyalty!--that made the first trouble between him and the man he shot.\nI've got to clear him!\"\n\n\"Will it be hard?\"\n\n\"They may make it so.  I can only see part of it surely.  When his wife\nleft the office, she met Cory on the street.  You saw what a pitiful\nkind of fool she was, irresponsible and helpless and feather-brained.\nThere are thousands of women like that everywhere--some of them are\n'Court Beauties,' I dare say--and they always mix things up; but they\nare most dangerous when they're like Claudine, because then they live\namong men of action like Cory and Fear.  Cory was artful: he spent the\nday about town telling people that he had always liked Happy; that his\nill feeling of yesterday was all gone; he wanted to find him and shake\nhis hand, bury past troubles and be friends.  I think he told Claudine\nthe same thing when they met, and convinced the tiny brainlet of his\nsincerity.  Cory was a man who 'had a way with him,' and I can see\nClaudine flattered at the idea of being peace-maker between 'two such\nnice gen'lemen as Mr. Cory and Mr. Fear.'  Her commonest\nasseveration--quite genuine, too--is that she doesn't like to have the\ngen'lemen making trouble about her!  So the poor imbecile led him to\nwhere her husband was waiting.  All that Happy knew of this was in her\ncry afterwards.  He was sitting alone, when Cory threw open the door\nand said, 'I've got you this time, Happy!'  His pistol was raised but\nnever fired.  He waited too long, meaning to establish his case of\n'self-defence,' and Fear is the quickest man I know.  Cory fell just\ninside the door.  Claudine stumbled upon him as she came running after\nhim, crying out to her husband that she 'never meant no trouble,' that\nCory had sworn to her that he only wanted to shake hands and 'make up.'\nOther people heard the shot and broke into the room, but they did not\ntry to stop Fear; he warned them off and walked out without hindrance,\nand came to me.  I've got to clear him.\"\n\nAriel knew what he meant: she realized the actual thing as it was, and,\nthough possessed by a strange feeling that it must all be medieval and\nnot possibly of to-day, understood that he would have to fight to keep\nhis friend from being killed; that the unhappy creature who had run\ninto the office out of the dark stood in high danger of having his neck\nbroken, unless Joe could help him. He made it clear to her that the\nState would kill Happy if it could; that it would be a point of pride\nwith certain deliberate men holding office to take the life of the\nlittle man; that if they did secure his death it would be set down to\ntheir efficiency, and was even competent as campaign material.  \"I wish\nto point out,\" Joe had heard a candidate for re-election vehemently\norate, \"that in addition to the other successful convictions I have\nnamed, I and my assistants have achieved the sending of three men to\nthe gallows during my term of office!\"\n\n\"I can't tell yet,\" said Joe, at parting.  \"It may be hard.  I'm so\nsorry you saw all this. I--\"\n\n\"Oh NO!\" she cried.  \"I want to UNDERSTAND!\"\n\n\nShe was still there, at the gate, her elbows resting upon the\ncross-bar, when, a long time after Joe had gone, there came from the\nalley behind the big back yard the minor chordings of a quartette of\nthose dark strollers who never seem to go to bed, who play by night and\nplayfully pretend to work by day:\n\n   \"You know my soul is a-full o' them-a-trub-bils,\n         Ev-ry mawn!\n   I cain' a-walk withouten I stum-bils!\n         Then le'ss go on--\n         Keep walkin' on!\n   These times is sow'owful, an' I am pow'owful\n         Sick an' fo'lawn!\"\n\n\nShe heard a step upon the path behind her, and, turning, saw a\nwhite-wrapped figure coming toward her.\n\n\"Mamie?\" she called.\n\n\"Hush!\" Mamie lifted a warning hand.  \"The windows are open,\" she\nwhispered.  \"They might hear you!\"\n\n\"Why haven't you gone to bed?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't you see?\" Mamie answered, in deep distress,--\"I've been\nsitting up for you.  We all thought you were writing letters in your\nroom, but after papa and mamma had gone to bed I went in to tell you\ngood night, and you weren't there, nor anywhere else; so I knew you\nmust have gone out.  I've been sitting by the front window, waiting to\nlet you in, but I went to sleep until a little while ago, when the\ntelephone-bell rang and he got up and answered it.  He kept talking a\nlong time; it was something about the Tocsin, and I'm afraid there's\nbeen a murder down-town.  When he went back to bed I fell asleep again,\nand then those darkies woke me up.  How on earth did you expect to get\nin?  Don't you know he always locks up the house?\"\n\n\"I could have rung,\" said Ariel.\n\n\"Oh--oh!\" gasped Miss Pike; and, after she had recovered somewhat,\nasked:  \"Do you mind telling me where you've been?  I won't tell\nhim--nor mamma, either.  I think, after all, I was wrong yesterday to\nfollow Eugene's advice.  He meant for the best, but I--\"\n\n\"Don't think that.  You weren't wrong.\"  Ariel put her arm round the\nother's waist.  \"I went to talk over some things with Mr. Louden.\"\n\n\"I think,\" whispered Mamie, trembling, \"that you are the bravest girl I\never knew--and--and--I could almost believe there's some good in him,\nsince you like him so.  I know there is.  And I--I think he's had a\nhard time.  I want you to know I won't even tell Eugene!\"\n\n\"You can tell everybody in the world,\" said Ariel, and kissed her.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nMR. SHEEHAN'S HINTS\n\n\"Never,\" said the Tocsin on the morrow, \"has this community been\nstirred to deeper indignation than by the cold-blooded and unmitigated\nbrutality of the deliberate murder committed almost under the very\nshadow of the Court-house cupola last night.  The victim was not a man\nof good repute, it is true, but at the moment of his death he was in\nthe act of performing a noble and generous action which showed that he\nmight have become, if he lived, a good and law-fearing citizen.  In\nbrief, he went to forgive his enemy and was stretching forth the hand\nof fellowship when that enemy shot him down.  Not half an hour before\nhis death, Cory had repeated within the hearing of a dozen men what he\nhad been saying all day, as many can testify:  'I want to find my old\nfriend Fear and shake hands with him.  I want to tell him that I\nforgive him and that I am ashamed of whatever has been my part in the\ntrouble between us.'  He went with that intention to his death.  The\nwife of the murderer has confessed that this was the substance of what\nhe said to her, and that she was convinced of his peaceful intentions.\nWhen they reached the room where her husband was waiting for her, Cory\nentered first.  The woman claims now that as they neared the vicinity\nhe hastened forward at a pace which she could not equal.  Naturally,\nher testimony on all points favoring her husband is practically\nworthless.  She followed and heard the murdered man speak, though what\nhis words were she declares she does not know, and of course the\nmurderer, after consultation with his lawyer, claims that their nature\nwas threatening.  Such a statement, in determining the truth, is worse\nthan valueless.  It is known and readily proved that Fear repeatedly\nthreatened the deceased's life yesterday, and there is no question in\nthe mind of any man, woman, or child, who reads these words, of the\ncold blooded nature of the crime.  The slayer, who had formerly made a\nmurderous attack upon his victim, lately quarrelled with him and\nuttered threats, as we have stated, upon his life.  The dead man came\nto him with protestations of friendship and was struck down a corpse.\nIt is understood that the defence will in desperation set up the theory\nof self-defence, based on an unsubstantiated claim that Cory entered\nthe room with a drawn pistol.  No pistol was found in the room.  The\nweapon with which the deed was accomplished was found upon the person\nof the murderer when he was seized by the police, one chamber\ndischarged.  Another revolver was discovered upon the person of the\nwoman, when she was arrested on the scene of the crime.  This, upon\nbeing strictly interrogated, she said she had picked up from the floor\nin the confusion, thinking it was her husband's and hoping to conceal\nit.  The chambers were full and undischarged, and we have heard it\nsurmised that the defence means to claim that it was Cory's.  Cory\ndoubtless went on his errand of forgiveness unarmed, and beyond doubt\nthe second weapon belonged to the woman herself, who has an unenviable\nrecord.\n\n\"The point of it all is plainly this: here is an unquestionable murder\nin the first degree, and the people of this city and county are\noutraged and incensed that such a crime should have been committed in\ntheir law-abiding and respectable community. With whom does the fault\nlie?  On whose head is this murder?  Not with the authorities, for they\ndo not countenance crime.  Has it come to the pass that, counting on\njuggleries of the law, criminals believe that they may kill, maim,\nburn, and slay as they list without punishment?  Is this to be another\ninstance of the law's delays and immunity for a hideous crime,\ncompassed by a cunning and cynical trickster of legal technicalities?\nThe people of Canaan cry out for a speedy trial, speedy conviction, and\nspeedy punishment of this cold-blooded and murderous monster.  If he is\nnot dealt with quickly according to his deserts, the climax is upon us\nand the limit of Canaan's patience has been reached.\n\n\"One last word, and we shall be glad to have its significance noted: J.\nLouden, Esq., has been retained for the defence!  The murderer, before\nbeing apprehended by the authorities, WENT STRAIGHT FROM THE SCENE OF\nHIS CRIME TO PLACE HIS RETAINER IN HIS ATTORNEY'S POCKET!  HOW LONG IS\nTHIS TO LAST?\"\n\n\nThe Tocsin was quoted on street corners that morning, in shop and store\nand office, wherever people talked of the Cory murder; and that was\neverywhere, for the people of Canaan and of the country roundabout\ntalked of nothing else.  Women chattered of it in parlor and kitchen;\nmen gathered in small groups on the street and shook their heads\nominously over it; farmers, meeting on the road, halted their teams and\nloudly damned the little man in the Canaan jail; milkmen lingered on\nback porches over their cans to agree with cooks that it was an awful\nthing, and that if ever any man deserved hanging, that there Fear\ndeserved it--his lawyer along with him!  Tipsy men hammered bars with\nfists and beer-glasses, inquiring if there was no rope to be had in the\ntown; and Joe Louden, returning to his office from the little\nrestaurant where he sometimes ate his breakfast, heard hisses following\nhim along Main Street.  A clerk, a fat-shouldered, blue-aproned,\npimple-cheeked youth, stood in the open doors of a grocery, and as he\npassed, stared him in the face and said \"Yah!\" with supreme disgust.\n\nJoe stopped.  \"Why?\" he asked, mildly.\n\nThe clerk put two fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly in\nderision.  \"You'd ort to be run out o' town!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I believe,\" said Joe, \"that we have never met before.\"\n\n\"Go on, you shyster!\"\n\nJoe looked at him gravely.  \"My dear sir,\" he returned, \"you speak to\nme with the familiarity of an old friend.\"\n\nThe clerk did not recover so far as to be capable of repartee until Joe\nhad entered his own stairway. Then, with a bitter sneer, he seized a\nbad potato from an open barrel and threw it at the mongrel, who had\npaused to examine the landscape.  The missile failed, and\nRespectability, after bestowing a slightly injured look upon the clerk,\nfollowed his master.\n\nIn the office the red-bearded man sat waiting. Not so red-bearded as of\nyore, however, was Mr. Sheehan, but grizzled and gray, and, this\nmorning, gray of face, too, as he sat, perspiring and anxious, wiping a\ntroubled brow with a black silk handkerchief.\n\n\"Here's the devil and all to pay at last, Joe,\" he said, uneasily, on\nthe other's entrance.  \"This is the worst I ever knew; and I hate to\nsay it, but I doubt yer pullin' it off.\"\n\n\"I've got to, Mike.\"\n\n\"I hope on my soul there's a chanst of it!  I like the little man, Joe.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"I know ye do, my boy.  But here's this Tocsin kickin' up the public\nsentiment; and if there ever was a follerin' sheep on earth, it's that\nsame public sentiment!\"\n\n\"If it weren't for that\"--Joe flung himself heavily in a\nchair--\"there'd not be so much trouble.  It's a clear enough case.\"\n\n\"But don't ye see,\" interrupted Sheehan, \"the Tocsin's tried it and\nconvicted him aforehand? And that if things keep goin' the way they've\nstarted to-day, the gran' jury's bound to indict him, and the trial\njury to convict him?  They wouldn't dare not to!  What's more, they'll\nwant to!  And they'll rush the trial, summer or no summer, and--\"\n\n\"I know, I know.\"\n\n\"I'll tell ye one thing,\" said the other, wiping his forehead with the\nblack handkerchief, \"and that's this, my boy: last night's business has\njust about put the cap on the Beach fer me.  I'm sick of it and I'm\ntired of it!  I'm ready to quit, sir!\"\n\nJoe looked at him sharply.  \"Don't you think my old notion of what\nmight be done could be made to pay?\"\n\nSheehan laughed.  \"Whoo!  You and yer hints, Joe!  How long past have\nye come around me with 'em! 'I b'lieve ye c'd make more money,\nMike'--that's the way ye'd put it,--'if ye altered the Beach a bit.\nMake a little country-side restaurant of it,' ye'd say, 'and have good\ncookin', and keep the boys and girls from raisin' so much hell out\nthere.  Soon ye'd have other people comin' beside the regular crowd.\nMake a little garden on the shore, and let 'em eat at tables under\ntrees an' grape-arbors--'\"\n\n\"Well, why not?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Haven't I been tellin' ye I'm thinkin' of it? It's only yer way of\nhintin' that's funny to me,--yer way of sayin' I'd make more money,\nbecause ye're afraid of preachin' at any of us: partly because ye know\nthe little good it 'd be, and partly because ye have humor.  Well, I'm\nthinkin' ye'll git yer way.  I'M willin' to go into the missionary\nbusiness with ye!\"\n\n\"Mike!\" said Joe, angrily, but he grew very red and failed to meet the\nother's eye, \"I'm not--\"\n\n\"Yes, ye are!\" cried Sheehan.  \"Yes, sir!  It's a thing ye prob'ly\nhaven't had the nerve to say to yerself since a boy, but that's yer\nnotion inside: ye're little better than a missionary!  It took me a\nlong while to understand what was drivin' ye, but I do now.  And ye've\ngone the right way about it, because we know ye'll stand fer us when\nwe're in trouble and fight fer us till we git a square deal, as ye're\ngoin' to fight for Happy now.\"\n\nJoe looked deeply troubled.  \"Never mind,\" he said, crossly, and with\nvisible embarrassment. \"You think you couldn't make more at the Beach\nif you ran it on my plan?\"\n\n\"I'm game to try,\" said Sheehan, slowly.  \"I'm too old to hold 'em down\nout there the way I yoosta could, and I'm sick of it--sick of it into\nthe very bones of me!\" He wiped his forehead.  \"Where's Claudine?\"\n\n\"Held as a witness.\"\n\n\"I'm not sorry fer HER!\" said the red-bearded man, emphatically.\n\"Women o' that kind are so light-headed it's a wonder they don't float.\nThink of her pickin' up Cory's gun from the floor and hidin' it in her\nclothes!  Took it fer granted it was Happy's, and thought she'd help\nhim by hidin' it! There's a hard point fer ye, Joe: to prove the gun\nbelonged to Cory.  There's nobody about here could swear to it.  I\ncouldn't myself, though I forced him to stick it back in his pocket\nyesterday. He was a wanderer, too; and ye'll have to send a keen one to\ntrace him, I'm thinkin', to find where he got it, so's ye can show it\nin court.\"\n\n\"I'm going myself.  I've found out that he came here from Denver.\"\n\n\"And from where before that?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I'll keep on travelling till I get what I want.\"\n\n\"That's right, my boy,\" exclaimed the other, heartily, \"It may be a\nlong trip, but ye're all the little man has to depend on.  Did ye\nnotice the Tocsin didn't even give him the credit fer givin' himself\nup?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe.  \"It's part of their game.\"\n\n\"Did it strike ye now,\" Mr. Sheehan asked, earnestly, leaning forward\nin his chair,--\"did it strike ye that the Tocsin was aimin' more to do\nHappy harm because of you than himself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  Joe looked sadly out of the window. \"I've thought that over,\nand it seemed possible that I might do Happy more good by giving his\ncase to some other lawyer.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" exclaimed the proprietor of Beaver Beach, loudly.  \"They've\nbegun their attack; they're bound to keep it up, and they'd manage to\nturn it to the discredit of both of ye.  Besides, Happy wouldn't have\nno other lawyer; he'd ruther be hung with you fightin' fer him than be\ncleared by anybody else.  I b'lieve it,--on my soul I do! But look\nhere,\" he went on, leaning still farther forward; \"I want to know if it\nstruck ye that this morning the Tocsin attacked ye in a way that was\nsomehow vi'lenter than ever before?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Joe, \"because it was aimed to strike where it would most\ncount.\"\n\n\"It ain't only that,\" said the other, excitedly. \"It ain't only that!\nI want ye to listen.  Now see here: the Tocsin is Pike, and the town is\nPike--I mean the town ye naturally belonged to.  Ain't it?\"\n\n\"In a way, I suppose--yes.\"\n\n\"In a way!\" echoed the other, scornfully.  \"Ye know it is!  Even as a\nboy Pike disliked ye and hated the kind of a boy ye was.  Ye wasn't\nrespectable and he was!  Ye wasn't rich and he was! Ye had a grin on\nyer face when ye'd meet him on the street.\"  The red-bearded man broke\noff at a gesture from Joe and exclaimed sharply:  \"Don't deny it!  _I_\nknow what ye was like!  Ye wasn't impudent, but ye looked at him as if\nye saw through him.  Now listen and I'll lead ye somewhere!  Ye run\nwith riffraff, naggers, and even\"--Mr. Sheehan lifted a forefinger\nsolemnly and shook it at his auditor--\"and even with the Irish!  Now I\nask ye this: ye've had one part of Canaan with ye from the start, MY\npart, that is; but the other's against ye; that part's PIKE, and it's\nthe rulin' part--\"\n\n\"Yes, Mike,\" said Joe, wearily.  \"In the spirit of things.  I know.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" cried the other.  \"That's the trouble: ye don't know.\nThere's more in Canaan than ye've understood.  Listen to this:  Why was\nthe Tocsin's attack harder this morning than ever before?  On yer soul\ndidn't it sound so bitter that it sounded desprit?  Now why?  It looked\nto me as if it had started to ruin ye, this time fer good and all! Why?\nWhat have ye had to do with Martin Pike lately?  Has the old wolf GOT\nto injure ye?\" Mr. Sheehan's voice rose and his eyes gleamed under\nbushy brows.  \"Think,\" he finished.  \"What's happened lately to make\nhim bite so hard?\"\n\nThere were some faded roses on the desk, and as Joe's haggard eyes fell\nupon them the answer came.  \"What makes you think Judge Pike isn't\ntrustworthy?\" he had asked Ariel, and her reply had been:  \"Nothing\nvery definite, unless it was his look when I told him that I meant to\nask you to take charge of things for me.\"\n\nHe got slowly and amazedly to his feet.  \"You've got it!\" he said.\n\n\"Ye see?\" cried Mike Sheehan, slapping his thigh with a big hand.  \"On\nmy soul I have the penetration!  Ye don't need to tell me one thing\nexcept this:  I told ye I'd lead ye somewhere; haven't I kept me word?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe.\n\n\"But I have the penetration!\" exclaimed Mr. Sheehan.  \"Should I miss my\nguess if I said that ye think Pike may be scared ye'll stumble on his\ntrack in some queer performances?  Should I miss it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Joe.  \"You wouldn't miss it.\"\n\n\"Just one thing more.\"  The red-bearded man rose, mopping the inner\nband of his straw hat. \"In the matter of yer runnin' fer Mayor, now--\"\n\nJoe, who had begun to pace up and down the room, made an impatient\ngesture.  \"Pshaw!\" he interrupted; but his friend stopped him with a\nhand laid on his arm.\n\n\"Don't be treatin' it as clean out of all possibility, Joe Louden.  If\nye do, it shows ye haven't sense to know that nobody can say what way\nthe wind's blowin' week after next.  All the boys want ye; Louie\nFarbach wants ye, and Louie has a big say. Who is it that doesn't want\nye?\"\n\n\"Canaan,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Hold up!  It's Pike's Canaan ye mean.  If ye git the nomination, ye'd\nbe elected, wouldn't ye?\"\n\n\"I couldn't be nominated.\"\n\n\"I ain't claimin' ye'd git Martin Pike's vote,\" returned Mr. Sheehan,\nsharply, \"though I don't say it's impossible.  Ye've got to beat him,\nthat's all.  Ye've got to do to him what he's done to YOU, and what\nhe's tryin' to do now worse than ever before.  Well--there may be ways\nto do it; and if he tempts me enough, I may fergit my troth and honor\nas a noble gentleman and help ye with a word ye'd never guess yerself.\"\n\n\"You've hinted at such mysteries before, Mike,\" Joe smiled.  \"I'd be\nglad to know what you mean, if there's anything in them.\"\n\n\"It may come to that,\" said the other, with some embarrassment.  \"It\nmay come to that some day, if the old wolf presses me too hard in the\nmatter o' tryin' to git the little man across the street hanged by the\nneck and yerself mobbed fer helpin' him!  But to-day I'll say no more.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mike.\"  Joe turned wearily to his desk.  \"I don't want you\nto break any promises.\"\n\nMr. Sheehan had gone to the door, but he paused on the threshold, and\nwiped his forehead again.\n\n\"And I don't want to break any,\" he said, \"but if ever the time should\ncome when I couldn't help it\"--he lowered his voice to a hoarse but\npiercing whisper--\"that will be the devourin' angel's day fer Martin\nPike!\"\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nIN THE HEAT OF THE DAY\n\nIt was a morning of the warmest week of mid-July, and Canaan lay inert\nand helpless beneath a broiling sun. The few people who moved about the\nstreets went languidly, keeping close to the wall on the shady side;\nthe women in thin white fabrics; the men, often coatless, carrying\npalm-leaf fans, and replacing collars with handkerchiefs.  In the\nCourt-house yard the maple leaves, gray with blown dust and grown to\ngreat breadth, drooped heavily, depressing the long, motionless\nbranches with their weight, so low that the four or five shabby idlers,\nupon the benches beneath, now and then flicked them sleepily with\nwhittled sprigs.  The doors and windows of the stores stood open,\ndisplaying limp wares of trade, but few tokens of life; the clerks\nhanging over dim counters as far as possible from the glare in front,\ngossiping fragmentarily, usually about the Cory murder, and, anon, upon\na subject suggested by the sight of an occasional pedestrian passing\nperspiring by with scrooged eyelids and purpling skin. From street and\nsidewalk, transparent hot waves swam up and danced themselves into\nnothing; while from the river bank, a half-mile away, came a sound\nhotter than even the locust's midsummer rasp: the drone of a\nplaning-mill.  A chance boy, lying prone in the grass of the\nCourt-house yard, was annoyed by the relentless chant and lifted his\nhead to mock it:  \"AWR-EER-AWR-EER!  SHUT UP, CAN'T YOU?\"  The effort\nwas exhausting: he relapsed and suffered with increasing malice but in\nsilence.\n\nAbruptly there was a violent outbreak on the \"National House\" corner,\nas when a quiet farmhouse is startled by some one's inadvertently\nbringing down all the tin from a shelf in the pantry.  The loafers on\nthe benches turned hopefully, saw what it was, then closed their eyes,\nand slumped back into their former positions.  The outbreak subsided as\nsuddenly as it had arisen:  Colonel Flitcroft pulled Mr. Arp down into\nhis chair again, and it was all over.\n\nGreater heat than that of these blazing days could not have kept one of\nthe sages from attending the conclave now.  For the battle was on in\nCanaan: and here, upon the National House corner, under the shadow of\nthe west wall, it waxed even keener.  Perhaps we may find full\njustification for calling what was happening a battle in so far as we\nrestrict the figure to apply to this one spot; else where, in the\nCanaan of the Tocsin, the conflict was too one-sided.  The Tocsin had\nindeed tried the case of Happy Fear in advance, had convicted and\ncondemned, and every day grew more bitter. Nor was the urgent vigor of\nits attack without effect.  Sleepy as Main Street seemed in the heat,\nthe town was incensed and roused to a tensity of feeling it had not\nknown since the civil war, when, on occasion, it had set out to hang\nhalf a dozen \"Knights of the Golden Circle.\"  Joe had been hissed on\nthe street many times since the inimical clerk had whistled at him.\nProbably demonstrations of that sort would have continued had he\nremained in Canaan; but for almost a month he had been absent and his\noffice closed, its threshold gray with dust.  There were people who\nbelieved that he had run away again, this time never to return; among\nthose who held to this opinion being Mrs. Louden and her sister, Joe's\nstep-aunt.  Upon only one point was everybody agreed: that twelve men\ncould not be found in the county who could be so far persuaded and\nbefuddled by Louden that they would dare to allow Happy Fear to escape.\nThe women of Canaan, incensed by the terrible circumstance of the case,\nas the Tocsin colored it--a man shot down in the act of begging his\nenemy's forgiveness--clamored as loudly as the men: there was only the\ndifference that the latter vociferated for the hanging of Happy; their\ngood ladies used the word \"punishment.\"\n\nAnd yet, while the place rang with condemnation of the little man in\nthe jail and his attorney, there were voices, here and there, uplifted\non the other side.  People existed, it astonishingly appeared, who\nLIKED Happy Fear.  These were for the greater part obscure and even\ndarkling in their lives, yet quite demonstrably human beings, able to\nsmile, suffer, leap, run, and to entertain fancies; even to have,\naccording to their degree, a certain rudimentary sense of right and\nwrong, in spite of which they strongly favored the prisoner's\nacquittal. Precisely on that account, it was argued, an acquittal would\noutrage Canaan and lay it open to untold danger: such people needed a\nlesson.\n\nThe Tocsin interviewed the town's great ones, printing their opinions\nof the heinousness of the crime and the character of the defendant's\nlawyer.... \"The Hon. P. J. Parrott, who so ably represented this county\nin the Legislature some fourteen years ago, could scarcely restrain\nhimself when approached by a reporter as to his sentiments anent the\nrepulsive deed.  'I should like to know how long Canaan is going to put\nup with this sort of business,' were his words.  'I am a law-abiding\ncitizen, and I have served faithfully, and with my full endeavor and\nability, to enact the laws and statutes of my State, but there is a\npoint in my patience, I would state, which lawbreakers and their\nlawyers may not safely pass.  Of what use are our most solemn\nenactments, I may even ask of what use is the Legislature itself,\nchosen by the will of the people, if they are to ruthlessly be set\naside by criminals and their shifty protectors? The blame should be put\nupon the lawyers who by tricks enable such rascals to escape the rigors\nof the carefully enacted laws, the fruits of the Solon's labor, more\nthan upon the criminals themselves. In this case, if there is any\nmiscarriage of justice, I will say here and now that in my opinion the\npeople of this county will be sorely tempted; and while I do not\nbelieve in lynch-law, yet if that should be the result it is my\nunalterable conviction that the vigilantes may well turn their\nattention to the lawyers--OR LAWYER--who bring about such miscarriage.\nI am sick of it.'\"\n\nThe Tocsin did not print the interview it obtained from Louie\nFarbach--the same Louie Farbach who long ago had owned a beer-saloon\nwith a little room behind the bar, where a shabby boy sometimes played\ndominoes and \"seven-up\" with loafers: not quite the same Louie Farbach,\nhowever, in outward circumstance: for he was now the brewer of Farbach\nBeer and making Canaan famous.  His rise had been Teutonic and sure;\nand he contributed one-twentieth of his income to the German Orphan\nAsylum and one-tenth to his party's campaign fund.  The twentieth saved\nthe orphans from the county, while the tithe gave the county to his\nparty.\n\nHe occupied a kitchen chair, enjoying the society of some chickens in a\nwired enclosure behind the new Italian villa he had erected in that\npart of Canaan where he would be most uncomfortable, and he looked\nwoodenly at the reporter when the latter put his question.\n\n\"Hef you any aguaintunce off Mitster Fear?\" he inquired, in return,\nwith no expression decipherable either upon his Gargantuan face or in\nhis heavily enfolded eyes.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied the reporter, grinning.  \"I never ran across him.\"\n\n\"Dot iss a goot t'ing fer you,\" said Mr. Farbach, stonily.  \"He iss not\na man peobles bedder try to run across.  It iss what Gory tried.  Now\nGory iss dead.\"\n\nThe reporter, slightly puzzled, lit a cigarette. \"See here, Mr.\nFarbach,\" he urged, \"I only want a word or two about this thing; and\nyou might give me a brief expression concerning that man Louden\nbesides: just a hint of what you think of his influence here, you know,\nand of the kind of sharp work he practises.  Something like that.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the brewer, slowly.  \"Happy Fear I hef knowt for a goot\nmany years.  He iss a goot frient of mine.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Choe Louten iss a bedder one,\" continued Mr. Farbach, turning again to\nstare at his chickens.\n\n\"Git owit.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Git owit,\" repeated the other, without passion, without anger, without\nany expression whatsoever. \"Git owit.\"\n\nThe reporter's prejudice against the German nation dated from that\nmoment.\n\nThere were others, here and there, who were less self-contained than\nthe brewer.  A farm-hand struck a fellow laborer in the harvest-field\nfor speaking ill of Joe; and the unravelling of a strange street fight,\none day, disclosed as its cause a like resentment, on the part of a\nblind broom-maker, engendered by a like offence.  The broom-maker's\ncompanion, reading the Tocsin as the two walked together, had begun the\nquarrel by remarking that Happy Fear ought to be hanged once for his\nown sake and twice more \"to show up that shyster Louden.\"  Warm words\nfollowed, leading to extremely material conflict, in which, in spite of\nhis blindness, the broom-maker had so much the best of it that he was\nremoved from the triumphant attitude he had assumed toward the person\nof his adversary, which was an admirable imitation of the dismounted\nSt. George and the Dragon, and conveyed to the jail.  Keenest\ninvestigation failed to reveal anything oblique in the man's record; to\nthe astonishment of Canaan, there was nothing against him.  He was\nblind and moderately poor; but a respectable, hard-working artisan, and\na pride to the church in which he was what has been called an \"active\nworker.\"  It was discovered that his sensitiveness to his companion's\nattack on Joseph Louden arose from the fact that Joe had obtained the\nacquittal of an imbecile sister of the blind man, a two-thirds-witted\nwoman who had been charged with bigamy.\n\nThe Tocsin made what it could of this, and so dexterously that the\nwrath of Canaan was one farther jot increased against the shyster.  Ay,\nthe town was hot, inside and out.\n\nLet us consider the Forum.  Was there ever before such a summer for the\n\"National House\" corner?  How voices first thundered there, then\ncracked and piped, is not to be rendered in all the tales of the\nfathers.  One who would make vivid the great doings must indeed \"dip\nhis brush in earthquake and eclipse\"; even then he could but picture\nthe credible, and must despair of this: the silence of Eskew Arp.  Not\nthat Eskew held his tongue, not that he was chary of speech--no! O\ntempora, O mores!  NO!  But that he refused the subject in hand, that\nhe eschewed expression upon it and resolutely drove the argument in\nother directions, that he achieved such superbly un-Arplike\ninconsistency; and with such rich material for his sardonic humors, not\nat arm's length, not even so far as his finger-tips, but beneath his\nvery palms, he rejected it: this was the impossible fact.\n\nEskew--there is no option but to declare--was no longer Eskew.  It is\nthe truth; since the morning when Ariel Tabor came down from Joe's\noffice, leaving her offering of white roses in that dingy, dusty, shady\nplace, Eskew had not been himself. His comrades observed it somewhat in\na physical difference, one of those alterations which may come upon men\nof his years suddenly, like a \"sea change\": his face was whiter, his\nwalk slower, his voice filed thinner; he creaked louder when he rose or\nsat.  Old always, from his boyhood, he had, in the turn of a hand,\nbecome aged.  But such things come and such things go: after eighty\nthere are ups and downs; people fading away one week, bloom out\npleasantly the next, and resiliency is not at all a patent belonging to\nyouth alone.  The material change in Mr. Arp might have been thought\nlittle worth remarking.  What caused Peter Bradbury, Squire Buckalew,\nand the Colonel to shake their heads secretly to one another and wonder\nif their good old friend's mind had not \"begun to go\" was something\nvery different.  To come straight down to it: he not only abstained\nfrom all argument upon the \"Cory Murder\" and the case of Happy Fear,\nrefusing to discuss either in any terms or under any circumstances, but\nhe also declined to speak of Ariel Tabor or of Joseph Louden; or of\ntheir affairs, singular or plural, masculine, feminine, or neuter, or\nin any declension. Not a word, committal or non-committal.  None!\n\nAnd his face, when he was silent, fell into sorrowful and troubled\nlines.\n\nAt first they merely marvelled.  Then Squire Buckalew dared to tempt\nhim.  Eskew's faded eyes showed a blue gleam, but he withstood,\nspeaking of Babylon to the disparagement of Chicago. They sought to\nlead him into what he evidently would not, employing many devices; but\nthe old man was wily and often carried them far afield by secret ways\nof his own.  This hot morning he had done that thing: they were close\nupon him, pressing him hard, when he roused that outburst which had\nstirred the idlers on the benches in the Court-house yard.  Squire\nBuckalew (sidelong at the others but squarely at Eskew) had volunteered\nthe information that Cory was a reformed priest. Stung by the mystery\nof Eskew's silence, the Squire's imagination had become magically\ngymnastic; and if anything under heaven could have lifted the veil,\nthis was the thing.  Mr. Arp's reply may be reverenced.\n\n\"I consider,\" he said, deliberately, \"that James G. Blaine's furrin\npolicy was childish, and, what's more, I never thought much of HIM!\"\n\nThis outdefied Ajax, and every trace of the matter in hand went to the\nfour winds.  Eskew, like Rome, was saved by a cackle, in which he\njoined, and a few moments later, as the bench loafers saw, was pulled\ndown into his seat by the Colonel.\n\nThe voices of the fathers fell to the pitch of ordinary discourse; the\ndrowsy town was quiet again; the whine of the planing-mill boring its\nway through the sizzling air to every wakening ear. Far away, on a\nquiet street, it sounded faintly, like the hum of a bee across a creek,\nand was drowned in the noise of men at work on the old Tabor house.  It\nseemed the only busy place in Canaan that day: the shade of the big\nbeech-trees which surrounded it affording some shelter from the\ndestroying sun to the dripping laborers who were sawing, hammering,\npainting, plumbing, papering, and ripping open old and new\npacking-boxes. There were many changes in the old house pleasantly in\nkeeping with its simple character: airy enlargements now almost\ncompleted so that some of the rooms were already finished, and stood,\nfurnished and immaculate, ready for tenancy.\n\nIn that which had been Roger Tabor's studio sat Ariel, alone.  She had\ncaused some chests and cases, stored there, to be opened, and had taken\nout of them a few of Roger's canvases and set them along the wall.\nTears filled her eyes as she looked at them, seeing the tragedy of\nlabor the old man had expended upon them; but she felt the recompense:\nhard, tight, literal as they were, he had had his moment of joy in each\nof them before he saw them coldly and knew the truth.  And he had been\ngiven his years of Paris at last: and had seen \"how the other fellows\ndid it.\"\n\nA heavy foot strode through the hall, coming abruptly to a halt in the\ndoorway, and turning, she discovered Martin Pike, his big\nHenry-the-Eighth face flushed more with anger than with the heat. His\nhat was upon his head, and remained there, nor did he offer any token\nor word of greeting whatever, but demanded to know when the work upon\nthe house had been begun.\n\n\"The second morning after my return,\" she answered.\n\n\"I want to know,\" he pursued, \"why it was kept secret from me, and I\nwant to know quick.\"\n\n\"Secret?\" she echoed, with a wave of her hand to indicate the noise\nwhich the workmen were making.\n\n\"Upon whose authority was it begun?\"\n\n\"Mine.  Who else could give it?\"\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, advancing toward her, \"don't you try to fool me!\nYou haven't done all this by yourself.  Who hired these workmen?\"\n\nRemembering her first interview with him, she rose quickly before he\ncould come near her.  \"Mr. Louden made most of the arrangements for\nme,\" she replied, quietly, \"before he went away.  He will take charge\nof everything when he returns. You haven't forgotten that I told you I\nintended to place my affairs in his hands?\"\n\nHe had started forward, but at this he stopped and stared at her\ninarticulately.\n\n\"You remember?\" she said, her hands resting negligently upon the back\nof the chair.  \"Surely you remember?\"\n\nShe was not in the least afraid of him, but coolly watchful of him.\nThis had been her habit with him since her return.  She had seen little\nof him, except at table, when he was usually grimly laconic, though now\nand then she would hear him joking heavily with Sam Warden in the yard,\nor, with evidently humorous intent, groaning at Mamie over Eugene's\nhealth; but it had not escaped Ariel that he was, on his part, watchful\nof herself, and upon his guard with a wariness in which she was\nsometimes surprised to believe that she saw an almost haggard\napprehension.\n\nHe did not answer her question, and it seemed to her, as she continued\nsteadily to meet his hot eyes, that he was trying to hold himself under\nsome measure of control; and a vain effort it proved.\n\n\"You go back to my house!\" he burst out, shouting hoarsely.  \"You get\nback there!  You stay there!\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, moving between him and the door.  \"Mamie and I are\ngoing for a drive.\"\n\n\"You go back to my house!\"  He followed her, waving an arm fiercely at\nher.  \"Don't you come around here trying to run over me!  You talk\nabout your 'affairs'!  All you've got on earth is this two-for-a-nickel\nold shack over your head and a bushel-basket of distillery stock that\nyou can sell by the pound for old paper!\"  He threw the words in her\nface, the bull-bass voice seamed and cracked with falsetto.  \"Old\npaper, old rags, old iron, bottles, old clothes!  You talk about your\naffairs!  Who are you?  Rothschild?  You haven't GOT any affairs!\"\n\nNot a look, not a word, not a motion of his escaped her in all the fury\nof sound and gesture in which he seemed fairly to envelop himself;\nleast of all did that shaking of his--the quivering of jaw and temple,\nthe tumultuous agitation of his hands--evade her watchfulness.\n\n\"When did you find this out?\" she said, very quickly.  \"After you\nbecame administrator?\"\n\nHe struck the back of the chair she had vacated a vicious blow with his\nopen hand.  \"No, you spendthrift!  All there was TO your grandfather\nwhen you buried him was a basket full of distillery stock, I tell you!\nOld paper!  Can't you hear me? Old paper, old rags--\"\n\n\"You have sent me the same income,\" she lifted her voice to interrupt;\n\"you have made the same quarterly payments since his death that you\nmade before.  If you knew, why did you do that?\"\n\nHe had been shouting at her with the frantic and incredulous\nexasperation of an intolerant man utterly unused to opposition; his\nface empurpled, his forehead dripping, and his hands ruthlessly\npounding the back of the chair; but this straight question stripped him\nsuddenly of gesture and left him standing limp and still before her,\npale splotches beginning to show on his hot cheeks.\n\n\"If you knew, why did you do it?\" she repeated. \"You wrote me that my\nincome was from dividends, and I knew and thought nothing about it; but\nif the stock which came to me was worthless, how could it pay\ndividends?\"\n\n\"It did not,\" he answered, huskily.  \"That distillery stock, I tell\nyou, isn't worth the matches to burn it.\"\n\n\"But there has been no difference in my income,\" she persisted,\nsteadily.  \"Why?  Can you explain that to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" he replied, and it seemed to her that he spoke with a\npallid and bitter desperation, like a man driven to the wall.  \"I can\nif you think you want to know.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"I sent it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean from you own--\"\n\n\"I mean it was my own money.\"\n\nShe had not taken her eyes from his, which met hers straightly and\nangrily; and at this she leaned forward, gazing at him with profound\nscrutiny.\n\n\"Why did you send it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Charity,\" he answered, after palpable hesitation.\n\nHer eyes widened and she leaned back against the lintel of the door,\nstaring at him incredulously. \"Charity!\" she echoed, in a whisper.\n\nPerhaps he mistook her amazement at his performance for dismay caused\nby the sense of her own position, for, as she seemed to weaken before\nhim, the strength of his own habit of dominance came back to him.\n\"Charity, madam!\" he broke out, shouting intolerably.  \"Charity, d'ye\nhear? I was a friend of the man that made the money you and your\ngrandfather squandered; I was a friend of Jonas Tabor, I say!  That's\nwhy I was willing to support you for a year and over, rather than let a\nniece of his suffer.\"\n\n\"'Suffer'!\" she cried.  \"'Support'!  You sent me a hundred thousand\nfrancs!\"\n\nThe white splotches which had mottled Martin Pike's face disappeared as\nif they had been suddenly splashed with hot red.  \"You go back to my\nhouse,\" he said.  \"What I sent you only shows the extent of my--\"\n\n\"Effrontery!\"  The word rang through the whole house, so loudly and\nclearly did she strike it, rang in his ears till it stung like a\ncastigation. It was ominous, portentous of justice and of disaster.\nThere was more than doubt of him in it: there was conviction.\n\nHe fell back from this word; and when he again advanced, Ariel had left\nthe house.  She had turned the next corner before he came out of the\ngate; and as he passed his own home on his way down-town, he saw her\nwhite dress mingling with his daughter's near the horse-block beside\nthe fire, where the two, with their arms about each other, stood\nwaiting for Sam Warden and the open summer carriage.\n\nJudge Pike walked on, the white splotches reappearing like a pale rash\nupon his face.  A yellow butterfly zigzagged before him, knee-high,\nacross the sidewalk.  He raised his foot and half kicked at it.\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nESKEW ARP\n\nAs the Judge continued his walk down Main Street, he wished profoundly\nthat the butterfly (which exhibited no annoyance) had been of greater\nbulk and more approachable; and it was the evil fortune of Joe's\nmongrel to encounter him in the sinister humor of such a wish\nunfulfilled. Respectability dwelt at Beaver Beach under the care of Mr.\nSheehan until his master should return; and Sheehan was kind; but the\nsmall dog found the world lonely and time long without Joe.  He had\ngrown more and more restless, and at last, this hot morning, having\nmanaged to evade the eye of all concerned in his keeping, made off\nunobtrusively, partly by swimming, and reaching the road, cantered into\ntown, his ears erect with anxiety. Bent upon reaching the familiar\noffice, he passed the grocery from the doorway of which the pimply\ncheeked clerk had thrown a bad potato at him a month before.  The same\nclerk had just laid down the Tocsin as Respectability went by, and,\ninspired to great deeds in behalf of justice and his native city, he\nrushed to the door, lavishly seized, this time, a perfectly good\npotato, and hurled it with a result which ecstasized him, for it took\nthe mongrel fairly aside the head, which it matched in size.\n\nThe luckless Respectability's purpose to reach Joe's stairway had been\nentirely definite, but upon this violence he forgot it momentarily.  It\nis not easy to keep things in mind when one is violently smitten on\nmouth, nose, cheek, eye, and ear by a missile large enough to strike\nthem simultaneously. Yelping and half blinded, he deflected to cross\nMain Street.  Judge Pike had elected to cross in the opposite\ndirection, and the two met in the middle of the street.\n\nThe encounter was miraculously fitted to the Judge's need: here was no\nbutterfly, but a solid body, light withal, a wet, muddy, and dusty\nyellow dog, eminently kickable.  The man was heavily built about the\nlegs, and the vigor of what he did may have been additionally inspired\nby his recognition of the mongrel as Joe Louden's.  The impact of his\ntoe upon the little runner's side was momentous, and the latter rose\ninto the air.  The Judge hopped, as one hops who, unshod in the night,\ndiscovers an unexpected chair.  Let us be reconciled to his pain and\nnot reproach the gods with it,--for two of his unintending adversary's\nribs were cracked.\n\nThe dog, thus again deflected, retraced his tracks, shrieking\ndistractedly, and, by one of those ironical twists which Karma reserves\nfor the tails of the fated, dived for blind safety into the store\ncommanded by the ecstatic and inimical clerk. There were shouts; the\nsleepy Square beginning to wake up: the boy who had mocked the\nplaning-mill got to his feet, calling upon his fellows; the bench\nloafers strolled to the street; the aged men stirred and rose from\ntheir chairs; faces appeared in the open windows of offices; sales\nladies and gentlemen came to the doorways of the trading-places; so\nthat when Respectability emerged from the grocery he had a notable\naudience for the scene he enacted with a brass dinner-bell tied to his\ntail.\n\nAnother potato, flung by the pimpled, uproarious, prodigal clerk, added\nto the impetus of his flight.  A shower of pebbles from the hands of\nexhilarated boys dented the soft asphalt about him; the hideous clamor\nof the pursuing bell increased as he turned the next corner, running\ndistractedly.  The dead town had come to life, and its inhabitants\ngladly risked the dangerous heat in the interests of sport, whereby it\nwas a merry chase the little dog led around the block, For thus some\ndestructive instinct drove him; he could not stop with the unappeasable\nTerror clanging at his heels and the increasing crowd yelling in\npursuit; but he turned to the left at each corner, and thus came back\nto pass Joe's stairway again, unable to pause there or anywhere, unable\nto do anything except to continue his hapless flight, poor meteor.\n\nRound the block he went once more, and still no chance at that empty\nstairway where, perhaps, he thought, there might be succor and safety.\nBlood was upon his side where Martin Pike's boot had crashed, foam and\nblood hung upon his jaws and lolling tongue.  He ran desperately,\nkeeping to the middle of the street, and, not howling, set himself\ndespairingly to outstrip the Terror.  The mob, disdaining the sun\nsuperbly, pursued as closely as it could, throwing bricks and rocks at\nhim, striking at him with clubs and sticks.  Happy Fear, playing\n\"tic-tac-toe,\" right hand against left, in his cell, heard the uproar,\nmade out something of what was happening, and, though unaware that it\nwas a friend whose life was sought, discovered a similarity to his own\ncase, and prayed to his dim gods that the quarry might get away.\n\n\"MAD DOG!\" they yelled.  \"MAD DOG!\"  And there were some who cried,\n\"JOE LOUDEN'S DOG!\" that being equally as exciting and explanatory.\n\nThree times round, and still the little fugitive maintained a lead.  A\ngray-helmeted policeman, a big fellow, had joined the pursuit.  He had\nchildren at home who might be playing in the street, and the thought of\nwhat might happen to them if the mad dog should head that way resolved\nhim to be cool and steady.  He was falling behind, so he stopped on the\ncorner, trusting that Respectability would come round again.  He was\nright, and the flying brownish thing streaked along Main Street,\npassing the beloved stairway for the fourth time.  The policeman lifted\nhis revolver, fired twice, missed once, but caught him with the second\nshot in a forepaw, clipping off a fifth toe, one of the small claws\nthat grow above the foot and are always in trouble.  This did not stop\nhim; but the policeman, afraid to risk another shot because of the\ncrowd, waited for him to come again; and many others, seeing the\nhopeless circuit the mongrel followed, did likewise, armed with bricks\nand clubs.  Among them was the pimply clerk, who had been inspired to\ncommandeer a pitchfork from a hardware store.\n\nWhen the fifth round came, Respectability's race was run.  He turned\ninto Main Street at a broken speed, limping, parched, voiceless,\nflecked with blood and foam, snapping feebly at the showering rocks,\nbut still indomitably a little ahead of the hunt.  There was no yelp\nleft in him--he was too thoroughly winded for that,--but in his\nbrilliant and despairing eyes shone the agony of a cry louder than the\ntongue of a dog could utter:  \"O master!  O all the god I know!  Where\nare you in my mortal need?\"\n\nNow indeed he had a gauntlet to run; for the street was lined with\nthose who awaited him, while the pursuit grew closer behind.  A number\nof the hardiest stood squarely in his path, and he hesitated for a\nsecond, which gave the opportunity for a surer aim, and many missiles\nstruck him.  \"Let him have it now, officer,\" said Eugene Bantry,\nstanding with Judge Pike at the policeman's elbow. \"There's your\nchance.\"\n\nBut before the revolver could be discharged, Respectability had begun\nto run again, hobbling on three legs and dodging feebly.  A heavy stone\nstruck him on the shoulder and he turned across the street, making for\nthe \"National House\" corner, where the joyful clerk brandished his\npitchfork. Going slowly, he almost touched the pimply one as he passed,\nand the clerk, already rehearsing in his mind the honors which should\nfollow the brave stroke, raised the tines above the little dog's head\nfor the coup de grace.  They did not descend, and the daring youth\nfailed of fame as the laurel almost embraced his brows.  A hickory\nwalking-stick was thrust between his legs; and he, expecting to strike,\nreceived a blow upon the temple sufficient for his present undoing and\nbedazzlement. He went over backwards, and the pitchfork (not the thing\nto hold poised on high when one is knocked down) fell with the force he\nhad intended for Respectability upon his own shin.\n\nA train had pulled into the station, and a tired, travel-worn young\nman, descending from a sleeper, walked rapidly up the street to learn\nthe occasion of what appeared to be a riot.  When he was close enough\nto understand its nature, he dropped his bag and came on at top speed,\nshouting loudly to the battered mongrel, who tried with his remaining\nstrength to leap toward him through a cordon of kicking legs, while\nEugene Bantry again called to the policeman to fire.\n\n\"If he does, damn you, I'll kill him!\" Joe saw the revolver raised; and\nthen, Eugene being in his way, he ran full-tilt into his stepbrother\nwith all his force, sending him to earth, and went on literally over\nhim as he lay prone upon the asphalt, that being the shortest way to\nRespectability. The next instant the mongrel was in his master's arms\nand weakly licking his hands.\n\nBut it was Eskew Arp who had saved the little dog; for it was his stick\nwhich had tripped the clerk, and his hand which had struck him down.\nAll his bodily strength had departed in that effort, but he staggered\nout into the street toward Joe.\n\n\"Joe Louden!\" called the veteran, in a loud voice.  \"Joe Louden!\" and\nsuddenly reeled.  The Colonel and Squire Buckalew were making their way\ntoward him, but Joe, holding the dog to his breast with one arm, threw\nthe other about Eskew.\n\n\"It's a town--it's a town\"--the old fellow flung himself free from the\nsupporting arm--\"it's a town you couldn't even trust a yellow dog to!\"\n\nHe sank back upon Joe's shoulder, speechless. An open carriage had\ndriven through the crowd, the colored driver urged by two ladies upon\nthe back seat, and Martin Pike saw it stop by the group in the middle\nof the street where Joe stood, the wounded dog held to his breast by\none arm, the old man, white and half fainting, supported by the other.\nMartin Pike saw this and more; he saw Ariel Tabor and his own daughter\nleaning from the carriage, the arms of both pityingly extended to Joe\nLouden and his two burdens, while the stunned and silly crowd stood\nround them staring, clouds of dust settling down upon them through the\nhot air.\n\n\n\nXX\n\nTHREE ARE ENLISTED\n\nNow in that blazing noon Canaan looked upon a strange sight: an open\ncarriage whirling through Main Street behind two galloping bays; upon\nthe back seat a ghostly white old man with closed eyes, supported by\ntwo pale ladies, his head upon the shoulder of the taller; while beside\nthe driver, a young man whose coat and hands were bloody, worked over\nthe hurts of an injured dog.  Sam Warden's whip sang across the horses;\nlather gathered on their flanks, and Ariel's voice steadily urged on\nthe pace:  \"Quicker, Sam, if you can.\"  For there was little breath\nleft in the body of Eskew Arp.\n\nMamie, almost as white as the old man, was silent; but she had not\nhesitated in her daring, now that she had been taught to dare; she had\nnot come to be Ariel's friend and honest follower for nothing; and it\nwas Mamie who had cried to Joe to lift Eskew into the carriage.  \"You\nmust come too,\" she said.  \"We will need you.\"  And so it came to pass\nthat under the eyes of Canaan Joe Louden rode in Judge Pike's carriage\nat the bidding of Judge Pike's daughter.\n\nToward Ariel's own house they sped with the stricken octogenarian, for\nhe was \"alone in the world,\" and she would not take him to the cottage\nwhere he had lived for many years by himself, a bleak little house, a\nderelict of the \"early days\" left stranded far down in the town between\na woollen-mill and the water-works.  The workmen were beginning their\ndinners under the big trees, but as Sam Warden drew in the lathered\nhorses at the gate, they set down their tin buckets hastily and ran to\nhelp Joe lift the old man out. Carefully they bore him into the house\nand laid him upon a bed in one of the finished rooms.  He did not speak\nor move and the workmen uncovered their heads as they went out, but Joe\nknew that they were mistaken.  \"It's all right, Mr. Arp,\" he said, as\nAriel knelt by the bed with water and restoratives.  \"It's all right.\nDon't you worry.\"\n\nThen the veteran's lips twitched, and though his eyes remained closed,\nJoe saw that Eskew understood, for he gasped, feebly:\n\"Pos-i-tive-ly--no--free--seats!\"\n\nTo Mrs. Louden, sewing at an up-stairs window, the sight of her stepson\ndescending from Judge Pike's carriage was sufficiently startling, but\nwhen she saw Mamie Pike take Respectability from his master's arms and\ncarry him tenderly indoors, while Joe and Ariel occupied themselves\nwith Mr. Arp, the good lady sprang to her feet as if she had been\nstung, regardlessly sending her work-basket and its contents scattering\nover the floor, and ran down the stairs three steps at a time.\n\nAt the front door she met her husband, entering for his dinner, and she\nleaped at him.  Had he seen?  What was it?  What had happened?\n\nMr. Louden rubbed his chin-beard, indulging himself in a pause which\nwas like to prove fatal to his companion, finally vouchsafing the\ninformation that the doctor's buggy was just turning the corner; Eskew\nArp had suffered a \"stroke,\" it was said, and, in Louden's opinion, was\na mighty sick man. His spouse replied in no uncertain terms that she\nhad seen quite that much for herself, urging him to continue, which he\ndid with a deliberation that caused her to recall their wedding-day\nwith a gust of passionate self-reproach.  Presently he managed to\ninterrupt, reminding her that her dining-room windows commanded as\ncomprehensive a view of the next house as did the front steps, and\nafter a time her housewifely duty so far prevailed over her indignation\nat the man's unwholesome stolidity that she followed him down the hall\nto preside over the meal, not, however, to partake largely of it\nherself.\n\nMr. Louden had no information of Eugene's mishap, nor had Mrs. Louden\nany suspicion that all was not well with the young man, and, hearing\nhim enter the front door, she called to him that his dinner was\nwaiting.  Eugene, however, made no reply and went up-stairs to his own\napartment without coming into the dining-room.\n\nA small crowd, neighboring children, servants, and negroes, had\ngathered about Ariel's gate, and Mrs. Louden watched the working-men\ndisperse this assembly, gather up their tools, and depart; then Mamie\ncame out of the house, and, bowing sadly to three old men who were\nentering the gate as she left it, stepped into her carriage and drove\naway.  The new-comers, Colonel Flitcroft, Squire Buckalew, and Peter\nBradbury, glanced at the doctor's buggy, shook their heads at one\nanother, and slowly went up to the porch, where Joe met them.  Mrs.\nLouden uttered a sharp exclamation, for the Colonel shook hands with\nher stepson.\n\nPerhaps Flitcroft himself was surprised; he had offered his hand almost\nunconsciously, and the greeting was embarrassed and perfunctory; but\nhis two companions, each in turn, gravely followed his lead, and Joe's\nset face flushed a little.  It was the first time in many years that\nmen of their kind in Canaan had offered him this salutation.\n\n\"He wouldn't let me send for you,\" he told them.  \"He said he knew\nyou'd be here soon without that.\"  And he led the way to Eskew's\nbedside.\n\nJoe and the doctor had undressed the old man, and had put him into\nnight-gear of Roger Tabor's, taken from an antique chest; it was soft\nand yellow and much more like color than the face above it, for the\nwhite hair on the pillow was not whiter than that.  Yet there was a\nstrange youthfulness in the eyes of Eskew; an eerie, inexplicable,\nluminous, LIVE look; the thin cheeks seemed fuller than they had been\nfor years; and though the heavier lines of age and sorrow could be\nseen, they appeared to have been half erased.  He lay not in sunshine,\nbut in clear light; the windows were open, the curtains restrained, for\nhe had asked them not to darken the room.\n\nThe doctor was whispering in a doctor's way to Ariel at the end of the\nroom opposite the bed, when the three old fellows came in.  None of\nthem spoke immediately, and though all three cleared their throats with\nwhat they meant for casual cheerfulness, to indicate that the situation\nwas not at all extraordinary or depressing, it was to be seen that the\nColonel's chin trembled under his mustache, and his comrades showed\nsimilar small and unwilling signs of emotion.\n\nEskew spoke first.  \"Well, boys?\" he said, and smiled.\n\nThat seemed to make it more difficult for the others; the three white\nheads bent silently over the fourth upon the pillow; and Ariel saw\nwaveringly, for her eyes suddenly filled, that the Colonel laid his\nunsteady hand upon Eskew's, which was outside the coverlet.\n\n\"It's--it's not,\" said the old soldier, gently--\"it's not on--on both\nsides, is it, Eskew?\"\n\nMr. Arp moved his hand slightly in answer.  \"It ain't paralysis,\" he\nsaid.  \"They call it 'shock and exhaustion'; but it's more than that.\nIt's just my time.  I've heard the call.  We've all been slidin' on\nthin ice this long time--and it's broke under me--\"\n\n\"Eskew, Eskew!\" remonstrated Peter Bradbury. \"You'd oughtn't to talk\nthat-a-way!  You only kind of overdone a little--heat o' the day, too,\nand--\"\n\n\"Peter,\" interrupted the sick man, with feeble asperity, \"did you ever\nmanage to fool me in your life?\"\n\n\"No, Eskew.\"\n\n\"Well, you're not doin' it now!\"\n\nTwo tears suddenly loosed themselves from Squire Buckalew's eyelids,\ndespite his hard endeavor to wink them away, and he turned from the bed\ntoo late to conceal what had happened. \"There ain't any call to feel\nbad,\" said Eskew. \"It might have happened any time--in the night,\nmaybe--at my house--and all alone--but here's Airie Tabor brought me to\nher own home and takin' care of me.  I couldn't ask any better way to\ngo, could I?\"\n\n\"I don't know what we'll do,\" stammered the Colonel, \"if you--you talk\nabout goin' away from us, Eskew.  We--we couldn't get along--\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I'm almost kind of glad to think,\" Mr. Arp murmured,\nbetween short struggles for breath, \"that it 'll be--quieter--on\nthe--\"National House\" corner!\"\n\nA moment later he called the doctor faintly and asked for a\nrestorative.  \"There,\" he said, in a stronger voice and with a gleam of\nsatisfaction in the vindication of his belief that he was dying.  \"I\nwas almost gone then.  _I_ know!\"  He lay panting for a moment, then\nspoke the name of Joe Louden.\n\nJoe came quickly to the bedside.\n\n\"I want you to shake hands with the Colonel and Peter and Buckalew.\"\n\n\"We did,\" answered the Colonel, infinitely surprised and troubled.  \"We\nshook hands outside before we came in.\"\n\n\n\"Do it again,\" said Eskew.  \"I want to see you.\"\n\nAnd Joe, making shift to smile, was suddenly blinded, so that he could\nnot see the wrinkled hands extended to him, and was fain to grope for\nthem.\n\n\"God knows why we didn't all take his hand long ago,\" said Eskew Arp.\n\"I didn't because I was stubborn.  I hated to admit that the argument\nwas against me.  I acknowledge it now before him and before you--and I\nwant the word of it CARRIED!\"\n\n\"It's all right, Mr. Arp,\" began Joe, tremulously. \"You mustn't--\"\n\n\"Hark to me\"--the old man's voice lifted higher:  \"If you'd ever\nwhimpered, or give back-talk, or broke out the wrong way, it would of\nbeen different.  But you never did.  I've watched you and I know; and\nyou've just gone your own way alone, with the town against you because\nyou got a bad name as a boy, and once we'd given you that, everything\nyou did or didn't do, we had to give you a blacker one.  Now it's time\nsome one stood by you!  Airie Tabor 'll do that with all her soul and\nbody.  She told me once I thought a good deal of you.  She knew!  But I\nwant these three old friends of mine to do it, too.  I was boys with\nthem and they'll do it, I think.  They've even stood up fer you against\nme, sometimes, but mostly fer the sake of the argument, I reckon; but\nnow they must do it when there's more to stand against than just my\ntalk.  They saw it all to-day--the meanest thing I ever knew!  I could\nof stood it all except that!\"  Before they could prevent him he had\nstruggled half upright in bed, lifting a clinched fist at the town\nbeyond the windows. \"But, by God! when they got so low down they tried\nto kill your dog--\"\n\nHe fell back, choking, in Joe's arms, and the physician bent over him,\nbut Eskew was not gone, and Ariel, upon the other side of the room,\ncould hear him whispering again for the restorative. She brought it,\nand when he had taken it, went quickly out-of-doors to the side yard.\n\nShe sat upon a workman's bench under the big trees, hidden from the\nstreet shrubbery, and breathing deeply of the shaded air, began to cry\nquietly.  Through the windows came the quavering voice of the old man,\nlifted again, insistent, a little querulous, but determined.  Responses\nsounded, intermittently, from the Colonel, from Peter, and from\nBuckalew, and now and then a sorrowful, yet almost humorous, protest\nfrom Joe; and so she made out that the veteran swore his three comrades\nto friendship with Joseph Louden, to lend him their countenance in all\nmatters, to stand by him in weal and woe, to speak only good of him and\ndefend him in the town of Canaan.  Thus did Eskew Arp on the verge of\nparting this life render justice.\n\n\nThe gate clicked, and Ariel saw Eugene approaching through the\nshrubbery.  One of his hands was bandaged, a thin strip of\ncourt-plaster crossed his forehead from his left eyebrow to his hair,\nand his thin and agitated face showed several light scratches.\n\n\"I saw you come out,\" he said.  \"I've been waiting to speak to you.\"\n\n\"The doctor told us to let him have his way in whatever he might ask.\"\nAriel wiped her eyes. \"I'm afraid that means--\"\n\n\"I didn't come to talk about Eskew Arp,\" interrupted Eugene.  \"I'm not\nlaboring under any anxiety about him.  You needn't be afraid; he's too\nsour to accept his conge so readily.\"\n\n\"Please lower your voice,\" she said, rising quickly and moving away\nfrom him toward the house; but, as he followed, insisting sharply that\nhe must speak with her, she walked out of ear-shot of the windows, and\nstopping, turned toward him.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said.  \"Is it a message from Mamie?\"\n\nAt this he faltered and hung fire.\n\n\"Have you been to see her?\" she continued.\n\n\"I am anxious to know if her goodness and bravery caused her any--any\ndiscomfort at home.\"\n\n\"You may set your mind at rest about that,\" returned Eugene.  \"I was\nthere when the Judge came home to dinner.  I suppose you fear he may\nhave been rough with her for taking my step-brother into the carriage.\nHe was not.  On the contrary, he spoke very quietly to her, and went on\nout toward the stables.  But I haven't come to you to talk of Judge\nPike, either!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ariel.  \"I don't care particularly to hear of him, but of\nMamie.\"\n\n\"Nor of her, either!\" he broke out.  \"I want to talk of you!\"\n\nThere was not mistaking him; no possibility of misunderstanding the\nreal passion that shook him, and her startled eyes betrayed her\ncomprehension.\n\n\"Yes, I see you understand,\" he cried, bitterly. \"That's because you've\nseen others the same way. God help me,\" he went on, striking his\nforehead with his open hand, \"that young fool of a Bradbury told me you\nrefused him only yesterday!  He was proud of even rejection from you!\nAnd there's Norbert--and half a dozen others, perhaps, already, since\nyou've been here.\"  He flung out his arms in ludicrous, savage despair.\n\"And here am I--\"\n\n\"Ah yes,\" she cut him off, \"it is of yourself that you want to speak,\nafter all--not of me!\"\n\n\"Look here,\" he vociferated; \"are you going to marry that Joe Louden?\nI want to know whether you are or not.  He gave me this--and this\nto-day!\"  He touched his bandaged hand and plastered forehead.  \"He ran\ninto me--over me--for nothing, when I was not on my guard; struck me\ndown--stamped on me--\"\n\nShe turned upon him, cheeks aflame, eyes sparkling and dry.\n\n\"Mr. Bantry,\" she cried, \"he did a good thing! And now I want you to go\nhome.  I want you to go home and try if you can discover anything in\nyourself that is worthy of Mamie and of what she showed herself to be\nthis morning!  If you can, you will have found something that I could\nlike!\"\n\nShe went rapidly toward the house, and he was senseless enough to\nfollow, babbling:  \"What do you think I'm made of?  You trample on\nme--as he did!  I can't bear everything; I tell you--\"\n\nBut she lifted her hand with such imperious will that he stopped short.\nThen, through the window of the sick-room came clearly the querulous\nvoice:\n\n\"I tell you it was; I heard him speak just now--out there in the yard,\nthat no-account step-brother of Joe's!  What if he IS a hired hand on\nthe Tocsin? He'd better give up his job and quit, than do what he's\ndone to help make the town think hard of Joe.  And what IS he?  Why,\nhe's worse than Cory.  When that Claudine Fear first came here, 'Gene\nBantry was hangin' around her himself. Joe knew it and he'd never tell,\nbut I will. I saw 'em buggy-ridin' out near Beaver Beach and she\nslapped his face fer him.  It ought to be TOLD!\"\n\n\"I didn't know that Joe knew--that!\" Eugene stammered huskily.  \"It\nwas--it was--a long time ago--\"\n\n\"If you understood Joe,\" she said, in a low voice, \"you would know that\nbefore these men leave this house, he will have their promise never to\ntell.\"\n\nHis eyes fell miserably, then lifted again; but in her clear and\nunbearable gaze there shone such a flame of scorn as he could not\nendure to look upon. For the first time in his life he saw a true light\nupon himself, and though the vision was darkling, the revelation was\ncomplete.\n\n\"Heaven pity you!\" she whispered.\n\nEugene found himself alone, and stumbled away, his glance not lifted.\nHe passed his own home without looking up, and did not see his mother\nbeckoning frantically from a window.  She ran to the door and called\nhim.  He did not hear her, but went on toward the Tocsin office with\nhis head still bent.\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nNORBERT WAITS FOR JOE\n\nThere was meat for gossip a plenty in Canaan that afternoon and\nevening; there were rumors that ran from kitchen to parlor, and rumors\nthat ran from parlor to kitchen; speculations that detained housewives\nin talk across front gates; wonderings that held cooks in converse over\nshadeless back fences in spite of the heat; and canards that brought\nMain Street clerks running to the shop doors to stare up and down the\nsidewalks.  Out of the confusion of report, the judicious were able by\nevenfall to extract a fair history of this day of revolution.  There\nremained no doubt that Joe Louden was in attendance at the death-bed of\nEskew Arp, and somehow it came to be known that Colonel Flitcroft,\nSquire Buckalew, and Peter Bradbury had shaken hands with Joe and\ndeclared themselves his friends. There were those (particularly among\nthe relatives of the hoary trio) who expressed the opinion that the\nColonel and his comrades were too old to be responsible and a\ncommission ought to sit on them; nevertheless, some echoes of Eskew's\nlast \"argument\" to the conclave had sounded in the town and were not\nwholly without effect.\n\nEverywhere there was a nipping curiosity to learn how Judge Pike had\n\"taken\" the strange performance of his daughter, and the eager were\nmuch disappointed when it was truthfully reported that he had done and\nsaid very little.  He had merely discharged both Sam Warden and Sam's\nwife from his service, the mild manner of the dismissal almost\nunnerving Mr. Warden, although he was fully prepared for bird-shot; and\nthe couple had found immediate employment in the service of Ariel Tabor.\n\nThose who humanly felt the Judge's behavior to be a trifle flat and\nunsensational were recompensed late in the afternoon when it became\nknown that Eugene Bantry had resigned his position on the Tocsin.  His\nreason for severing his connection was dumfounding; he had written a\nformal letter to the Judge and repeated the gist of it to his\nassociates in the office and acquaintances upon the street.  He\ndeclared that he no longer sympathized with the attitude of the Tocsin\ntoward his step-brother, and regretted that he had previously assisted\nin emphasizing the paper's hostility to Joe, particularly in the matter\nof the approaching murder trial.  This being the case, he felt that his\neffectiveness in the service of the paper had ceased, and he must, in\njustice to the owner, resign.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" was the simple comment of the elder Louden when his\nstep-son sought him out at the factory and repeated this statement to\nhim.\n\n\"So am I, I think,\" said Eugene, wanly.  \"Good-bye. I'm going now to\nsee mother, but I'll be gone before you come home.\"\n\n\"Gone where?\"\n\n\"Just away.  I don't know where,\" Eugene answered from the door.  \"I\ncouldn't live here any longer.  I--\"\n\n\"You've been drinking,\" said Mr. Louden, inspired.  \"You'd better not\nlet Mamie Pike see you.\"\n\nEugene laughed desolately.  \"I don't mean to. I shall write to her.\nGood-bye,\" he said, and was gone before Mr. Louden could restore enough\norder out of the chaos in his mind to stop him.\n\nThus Mrs. Louden's long wait at the window was tragically rewarded, and\nshe became an unhappy actor in Canaan's drama of that day.  Other\nladies attended at other windows, or near their front doors, throughout\nthe afternoon: the families of the three patriarchs awaiting their\nreturn, as the time drew on, with something akin to frenzy. Mrs.\nFlitcroft (a lady of temper), whose rheumatism confined her to a chair,\nhad her grandson wheel her out upon the porch, and, as the dusk fell\nand she finally saw her husband coming at a laggard pace, leaning upon\nhis cane, his chin sunk on his breast, she frankly told Norbert that\nalthough she had lived with that man more than fifty-seven years, she\nwould never be able to understand him.  She repeated this with genuine\nsymptoms of hysteria when she discovered that the Colonel had not come\nstraight from the Tabor house, but had stopped two hours at Peter\nBradbury's to \"talk it over.\"\n\nOne item of his recital, while sufficiently startling to his wife, had\na remarkable effect upon his grandson.  This was the information that\nAriel Tabor's fortune no longer existed.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Norbert, starting to his feet.  \"What are you\ntalking about?\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said the Colonel, deliberately.  \"She told me so herself.\nEskew had dropped off into a sort of doze--more like a stupor,\nperhaps,--and we all went into Roger's old studio, except Louden and\nthe doctor, and while we were there, talkin', one of Pike's clerks came\nwith a basket full of tin boxes and packages of papers and talked to\nMiss Tabor at the door and went away.  Then old Peter blundered out and\nasked her point-blank what it was, and she said it was her estate,\nalmost everything she had, except the house.  Buckalew, tryin' to make\na joke, said he'd be willin' to swap HIS house and lot for the basket,\nand she laughed and told him she thought he'd be sorry; that all there\nwas, to speak of, was a pile of distillery stock--\" \"What?\" repeated\nNorbert, incredulously.\n\n\"Yes.  It was the truth,\" said the Colonel, solemnly.  \"I saw it\nmyself: blocks and blocks of stock in that distillery trust that went\nup higher'n a kite last year.  Roger had put all of Jonas's good\nmoney--\"\n\n\"Not into that!\" shouted Norbert, uncontrollably excited.\n\n\"Yes, he did.  I tell you I saw it!\"\n\n\"I tell you he didn't.  He owned Granger Gas, worth more to-day than it\never was!  Pike was Roger's attorney-in-fact and bought it for him\nbefore the old man died.  The check went through my hands.  You don't\nthink I'd forget as big a check as that, do you, even if it was more\nthan a year ago?  Or how it was signed and who made out to?  It was\nMartin Pike that got caught with distillery stock.  He speculated once\ntoo often!\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong,\" persisted the Colonel.  \"I tell you I saw it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Then you're blind,\" returned his grandson, disrespectfully; \"you're\nblind or else--or else--\" He paused, open-mouthed, a look of wonder\nstruggling its way to expression upon him, gradually conquering every\nknobby outpost of his countenance. He struck his fat hands together.\n\"Where's Joe Louden?\" he asked, sharply.  \"I want to see him.  Did you\nleave him at Miss Tabor's?\"\n\n\"He's goin' to sit up with Eskew.  What do you want of him?\"\n\n\"I should say you better ask that!\" Mrs. Flitcroft began, shrilly.\n\"It's enough, I guess, for one of this family to go runnin' after him\nand shakin' hands with him and Heaven knows what not!  NORBERT\nFLITCROFT!\"\n\nBut Norbert jumped from the porch, ruthlessly crossed his grandmother's\ngeranium-bed, and, making off at as sharp a pace as his architecture\npermitted, within ten minutes opened Ariel's gate.\n\nSam Warden came forward to meet him.\n\n\"Don't ring, please, suh,\" said Sam.  \"Dey sot me out heah to tell\ninquirin' frien's dat po' ole Mist' Arp mighty low.\"\n\n\"I want to see Mr. Louden,\" returned Norbert. \"I want to see him\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"I don' reckon he kin come out yit,\" Sam said, in a low tone.  \"But I\nkin go in an' ast 'em.\"\n\nHe stepped softly within, leaving Norbert waiting, and went to the door\nof the sick-room.  The door was open, the room brightly lighted, as\nEskew had commanded when, a little earlier, he awoke.\n\nJoe and Ariel were alone with him, leaning toward him with such white\nanxiety that the colored man needed no warning to make him remain\nsilent in the hallway.  The veteran was speaking and his voice was very\nweak, seeming to come from a great distance.\n\n\"It's mighty funny, but I feel like I used to when I was a little boy.\nI reckon I'm kind of scared--after all.  Airie Tabor,--are you--here?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Arp.\"\n\n\"I thought--so--but I--I don't see very well--lately.\nI--wanted--to--know--to know--\"\n\n\"Yes--to know?\"  She knelt close beside him.\n\n\"It's kind of--foolish,\" he whispered.  \"I just--wanted to know if you\nwas still here.  It--don't seem so lonesome now that I know.\"\n\nShe put her arm lightly about him and he smiled and was silent for a\ntime.  Then he struggled to rise upon his elbow, and they lifted him a\nlittle.\n\n\"It's hard to breathe,\" gasped the old man. \"I'm pretty near--the big\nroad.  Joe Louden--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You'd have been--willing--willing to change places with me--just\nnow--when Airie--\"\n\nJoe laid his hand on his, and Eskew smiled again. \"I thought so!  And,\nJoe--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You always--always had the--the best of that joke between us.  Do\nyou--you suppose they charge admission--up there?\"  His eyes were\nlifted.  \"Do you suppose you've got to--to show your good deeds to git\nin?\"  The answering whisper was almost as faint as the old man's.\n\n\"No,\" panted Eskew, \"nobody knows.  But I hope--I do hope--they'll have\nsome free seats. It's a--mighty poor show--we'll--all have--if\nthey--don't!\"\n\nHe sighed peacefully, his head grew heavier on Joe's arm; and the young\nman set his hand gently upon the unseeing eyes.  Ariel did not rise\nfrom where she knelt, but looked up at him when, a little later, he\nlifted his hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe, \"you can cry now.\"\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nMR. SHEEHAN SPEAKS\n\nJoe helped to carry what was mortal of Eskew from Ariel's house to its\nfinal abiding-place.  With him, in that task, were Buckalew, Bradbury,\nthe Colonel, and the grandsons of the two latter, and Mrs. Louden drew\nin her skirts grimly as her step-son passed her in the mournful\nprocession through the hall.  Her eyes were red with weeping (not for\nEskew), but not so red as those of Mamie Pike, who stood beside her.\n\nOn the way to the cemetery, Joe and Ariel were together in a carriage\nwith Buckalew and the minister who had read the service, a dark,\npleasant-eyed young man;--and the Squire, after being almost overcome\nduring the ceremony, experienced a natural reaction, talking cheerfully\nthroughout the long drive.  He recounted many anecdotes of Eskew,\nchuckling over most of them, though filled with wonder by a coincidence\nwhich he and Flitcroft had discovered; the Colonel had recently been\nmade the custodian of his old friend's will, and it had been opened the\nday before the funeral.  Eskew had left everything he possessed--with\nthe regret that it was so little--to Joe.\n\n\"But the queer thing about it,\" said the Squire, addressing himself to\nAriel, \"was the date of it, the seventeenth of June.  The Colonel and I\ngot to talkin' it over, out on his porch, last night, tryin' to\nrec'lect what was goin' on about then, and we figgered it out that it\nwas the Monday after you come back, the very day he got so upset when\nhe saw you goin' up to Louden's law-office with your roses.\"\n\nJoe looked quickly at Ariel.  She did not meet his glance, but, turning\ninstead to Ladew, the clergyman, began, with a barely perceptible\nblush, to talk of something he had said in a sermon two weeks ago.  The\ntwo fell into a thoughtful and amiable discussion, during which there\nstole into Joe's heart a strange and unreasonable pain.  The young\nminister had lived in Canaan only a few months, and Joe had never seen\nhim until that morning; but he liked the short, honest talk he had\nmade; liked his cadenceless voice and keen, dark face; and, recalling\nwhat he had heard Martin Pike vociferating in his brougham one Sunday,\nperceived that Ladew was the fellow who had \"got to go\" because his\nsermons did not please the Judge.  Yet Ariel remembered for more than a\nfortnight a passage from one of these sermons. And as Joe looked at the\nmanly and intelligent face opposite him, it did not seem strange that\nshe should.\n\nHe resolutely turned his eyes to the open window and saw that they had\nentered the cemetery, were near the green knoll where Eskew was to lie\nbeside a brother who had died long ago.  He let the minister help Ariel\nout, going quickly forward himself with Buckalew; and then--after the\nlittle while that the restoration of dust to dust mercifully needs--he\nreturned to the carriage only to get his hat.\n\nAriel and Ladew and the Squire were already seated and waiting.\n\"Aren't you going to ride home with us?\" she asked, surprised.\n\n\"No,\" he explained, not looking at her.  \"I have to talk with Norbert\nFlitcroft.  I'm going back with him.  Good-bye.\"\n\nHis excuse was the mere truth, his conversation with Norbert, in the\ncarriage which they managed to secure to themselves, continuing\nearnestly until Joe spoke to the driver and alighted at a corner, near\nMr. Farbach's Italian possessions.  \"Don't forget,\" he said, as he\nclosed the carriage door, \"I've got to have both ends of the string in\nmy hands.\"\n\n\"Forget!\" Norbert looked at the cupola of the Pike Mansion, rising\nabove the maples down the street.  \"It isn't likely I'll forget!\"\n\n\nWhen Joe entered the \"Louis Quinze room\" which some decorator, drunk\nwith power, had mingled into the brewer's villa, he found the owner and\nMr. Sheehan, with five other men, engaged in a meritorious attempt to\ntone down the apartment with smoke.  Two of the five others were\nprosperous owners of saloons; two were known to the public (whose\nnotion of what it meant when it used the term was something of the\nvaguest) as politicians; the fifth was Mr. Farbach's closest friend,\none who (Joe had heard) was to be the next chairman of the city\ncommittee of the party. They were seated about a table, enveloped in\nblue clouds, and hushed to a grave and pertinent silence which\nclarified immediately the circumstance that whatever debate had\npreceded his arrival, it was now settled.\n\nTheir greeting of him, however, though exceedingly quiet, indicated a\ncertain expectancy, as he accepted the chair which had been left for\nhim at the head of the table.  He looked thinner and paler than usual,\nwhich is saying a great deal; but presently, finding that the fateful\nhush which his entrance had broken was immediately resumed, a twinkle\ncame into his eye, one of his eyebrows went up and a corner of his\nmouth went down.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen?\" he said.\n\nThe smokers continued to smoke and to do nothing else; the exception\nbeing Mr. Sheehan, who, though he spoke not, exhibited tokens of\nagitation and excitement which he curbed with difficulty; shifting\nabout in his chair, gnawing his cigar, crossing and uncrossing his\nknees, rubbing and slapping his hands together, clearing his throat\nwith violence, his eyes fixed all the while, as were those of his\ncompanions, upon Mr. Farbach; so that Joe was given to perceive that it\nhad been agreed that the brewer should be the spokesman. Mr. Farbach\nwas deliberate, that was all, which added to the effect of what he\nfinally did say.\n\n\"Choe,\" he remarked, placidly, \"you are der next Mayor off Canaan.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" asked the young man, sharply.\n\n\"Bickoss us here,\" he answered, interlocking the tips of his fingers\nover his waistcoat, that being as near folding his hands as lay within\nhis power,--\"bickoss us here shall try to fix it so, und so hef\nditcided.\"\n\nJoe took a deep breath.  \"Why do you want me?\"\n\n\"Dot,\" replied the brewer, \"iss someding I shall tell you.\"  He paused\nto contemplate his cigar. \"We want you bickoss you are der best man fer\ndot positsion.\"\n\n\"Louie, you mustn't make a mistake at the beginning,\" Joe said,\nhurriedly.  \"I may not be the kind of man you're looking for.  If I\nwent in--\" He hesitated, stammering.  \"It seems an ungrateful thing to\nsay, but--but there wouldn't be any slackness--I couldn't be bound to\nanybody--\"\n\n\"Holt up your hosses!\" Mr. Farbach, once in his life, was so ready to\nreply that he was able to interrupt.  \"Who hef you heert speak off\nbounding? Hef I speakt off favors?  Dit I say der shoult be slackness\nin der city gofer'ment?  Litsen to me, Choe.\"  He renewed his\ncontemplation of his cigar, then proceeded:  \"I hef been t'inkin' it\nofer, now a couple years.  I hef mate up my mind.  If some peobles are\ngombelt to keep der laws and oders are not, dot's a great atwantitch to\nder oders. Dot iss what iss ruining der gountry und der peobles iss\ncommencement to take notice.  Efer'veres in oder towns der iss\nhousecleaning; dey are reforming und indieding, und pooty soon dot\nmofement comes here--shoo-er!  If we intent to holt der parsly in\npower, we shoult be a leetle ahead off dot mofement so, when it shoult\nbe here, we hef a goot 'minadstration to fall beck on.  Now, dere iss\nanoder brewery opened und trying to gombete mit me here in Canaan.  If\ndot brewery owns der Mayor, all der tsaloons buying my bier must shut\nup at 'leven o'glock und Sundays, but der oders keep open.  If I own\nder Mayor, I make der same against dot oder brewery.  Now I am pooty\nsick off dot ways off bitsness und fighting all times. Also,\" Mr.\nFarbach added, with magnificent calmness, \"my trade iss larchly\nowitside off Canaan, und it iss bedder dot here der laws shoult be\nenforced der same fer all.  Litsen, Choe; all us here beliefs der same\nway.  You are square.  Der whole tsaloon element knows dot, und knows\ndot all voult be treated der same.  Mit you it voult be fairness fer\neach one.  Foolish peobles hef sait you are a law-tricker, but we know\ndot you hef only mate der laws brotect as well as bunish.  Und at such\ntimes as dey het been broken, you hef made dem as mertsiful as you\ncoult.  You are no tricker. We are willing to help you make it a glean\ntown. Odervise der fightin' voult go on until der mofement strikes here\nund all der granks vake up und we git a fool reformer fer Mayor und der\ntown goes to der dogs.  If I try to put in a man dot I own, der oder\nbrewery iss goin' to fight like hell, but if I work fer you it will not\nfight so hart.\"\n\n\"But the other people,\" Joe objected, \"those outside of what is called\nthe saloon element--do you understand how many of them will be against\nme?\"\n\n\"It iss der tsaloon element,\" Mr. Farbach returned, peacefully, \"dot\ndoes der fightin'.\"\n\n\"And you have considered my standing with that part of Canaan which\nconsiders itself the most respectable section?\"  He rose to his feet,\nstanding straight and quiet, facing the table, upon which, it chanced,\nthere lay a copy of the Tocsin.\n\n\"Und yet,\" observed Mr. Farbach, with mildness, \"we got some pooty\nrisbecdable men right here.\"\n\n\"Except me,\" broke in Mr. Sheehan, grimly, \"you have.\"\n\n\"Have you thought of this?\" Joe leaned forward and touched the paper\nupon the table.\n\n\"We hef,\" replied Mr. Farbach.  \"All of us. You shall beat it.\"\n\nThere was a strong chorus of confirmation from the others, and Joe's\neyes flashed.\n\n\"Have you considered,\" he continued, rapidly, while a warm color began\nto conquer his pallor,--\"have you considered the powerful influence\nwhich will be against me, and more against me now, I should tell you,\nthan ever before?  That influence, I mean, which is striving so hard to\ndiscredit me that lynch-law has been hinted for poor Fear if I should\nclear him!  Have you thought of that? Have you thought--\"\n\n\"Have we thought o' Martin Pike?\" exclaimed Mr. Sheehan, springing to\nhis feet, face aflame and beard bristling.  \"Ay, we've thought o'\nMartin Pike, and our thinkin' of him is where he begins to git what's\ncomin' to him!  What d'ye stand there pickin' straws fer?  What's the\nmatter with ye?\" he demanded, angrily, his violence tenfold increased\nby the long repression he had put upon himself during the brewer's\ndeliberate utterances. \"If Louie Farbach and his crowd says they're fer\nye, I guess ye've got a chanst, haven't ye?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Joe.  \"I think you underestimate Pike's influence--\"\n\n\"Underestimate the devil!\" shouted Mr. Sheehan, uncontrollably excited.\n\"You talk about influence!  He's been the worst influence this town's\never had--and his tracks covered up in the dark wherever he set his\nugly foot down.  These men know it, and you know some, but not the\nworst of it, because none of ye live as deep down in it as I do!  Ye\nwant to make a clean town of it, ye want to make a little heaven of the\nBeach--\"\n\n\"And in the eyes of Judge Pike,\" Joe cut him off, \"and of all who take\ntheir opinions from him, I REPRESENT Beaver Beach!\"\n\nMike Sheehan gave a wild shout.  \"Whooroo! It's come!  I knowed it\nwould!  The day I couldn't hold my tongue, though I passed my word I\nwould when the coward showed the deed he didn't dare to git recorded!\nWaugh!\"  He shouted again, with bitter laughter.  \"Ye do!  In the eyes\no' them as follow Martin Pike ye stand fer the Beach and all its\nwickedness, do ye?  Whooroo!  It's come!  Ye're an offence in the eyes\no' Martin Pike and all his kind because ye stand fer the Beach, are ye?\"\n\n\"You know it!\" Joe answered, sharply.  \"If they could wipe the Beach\noff the map and me with it--\"\n\n\"Martin Pike would?\" shouted Mr. Sheehan, while the others,\nopen-mouthed, stared at him. \"Martin Pike would?\"\n\n\"I don't need to tell you that,\" said Joe.\n\nMr. Sheehan's big fist rose high over the table and descended crashing\nupon it.  \"It's a damn lie!\" he roared.  \"Martin Pike owns Beaver\nBeach!\"\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nJOE WALKS ACROSS THE COURT-HOUSE YARD\n\nFrom within the glossy old walnut bar that ran from wall to wall, the\neyes of the lawyers and reporters wandered often to Ariel as she sat in\nthe packed court-room watching Louden's fight for the life and liberty\nof Happy Fear. She had always three escorts, and though she did not\nmiss a session, and the same three never failed to attend her, no\nwhisper of scandal arose.  But not upon them did the glances of the\nmembers of the bar and the journalists with tender frequency linger;\nnor were the younger members of these two professions all who gazed\nthat way.  Joe had fought out the selection of the jury with the\nprosecutor at great length and with infinite pains; it was not a young\njury, and IT stared at her.  The \"Court\" wore a gray beard with which a\nflock of sparrows might have villaged a grove, and yet, in spite of the\nvital necessity for watchfulness over this fighting case, IT once\nneeded to be stirred from a trancelike gaze in Miss Tabor's direction\nand aroused to the realization that It was there to Sit and not to\ndream.\n\nThe August air was warm outside the windows, inviting to the open\ncountry, to swimmin'-hole, to orchard reveries, or shaded pool wherein\nto drop a meditative line; you would have thought no one could\nwillingly coop himself in this hot room for three hours, twice a day,\nwhile lawyers wrangled, often unintelligibly, over the life of a dingy\nlittle creature like Happy Fear, yet the struggle to swelter there was\nalmost like a riot, and the bailiffs were busy men.\n\nIt was a fighting case throughout, fought to a finish on each tiny\npoint as it came up, dragging, in the mere matter of time,\ninterminably, yet the people of Canaan (not only those who succeeded in\npenetrating to the court-room, but the others who hung about the\ncorridors, or outside the building, and the great mass of stay-at-homes\nwho read the story in the Tocsin) found each moment of it enthralling\nenough.  The State's attorney, fearful of losing so notorious a case,\nand not underestimating his opponent, had modestly summoned others to\nhis aid; and the attorney for the defence, single-handed, faced \"an\narray of legal talent such as seldom indeed had hollered at this bar\";\nfaced it good-naturedly, an eyebrow crooked up and his head on one\nside, most of the time, yet faced it indomitably.  He had a certain\ncareless and disarming smile when he lost a point, which carried off\nthe defeat as of only humorous account and not at all part of the\nserious business in hand; and in his treatment of witnesses, he was\nplausible, kindly, knowing that in this case he had no intending\nperjurer to entrap; brought into play the rare and delicate art of\nwhich he was a master, employing in his questions subtle suggestions\nand shadings of tone and manner, and avoiding words of debatable and\ndangerous meanings;--a fine craft, often attempted by blunderers to\ntheir own undoing, but which, practised by Joseph Louden, made\ninarticulate witnesses articulate to the precise effects which he\ndesired.  This he accomplished as much by the help of the continuous\nfire of objections from the other side as in spite of them.  He was\ninfinitely careful, asking never an ill-advised question for the other\nside to use to his hurt, and, though exhibiting only a pleasant\neasiness of manner, was electrically alert.\n\nA hundred things had shown Ariel that the feeling of the place,\ninfluenced by \"public sentiment\" without, was subtly and profoundly\nhostile to Joe and his client; she read this in the spectators, in the\njury, even in the Judge; but it seemed to her that day by day the\ninimical spirit gradually failed, inside the railing, and also in those\nspectators who, like herself, were enabled by special favor to be\npresent throughout the trial, and that now and then a kindlier\nsentiment began to be manifested. She was unaware how strongly she\ncontributed to effect this herself, not only through the glow of\nvisible sympathy which radiated from her, but by a particular action.\nClaudine was called by the State, and told as much of her story as the\nlaw permitted her to tell, interlarding her replies with fervent\nprotestations (too quick to be prevented) that she \"never meant to\nbring no trouble to Mr. Fear\" and that she \"did hate to have gen'lemen\nstarting things on her account.\"  When the defence took this perturbed\nwitness, her interpolations became less frequent, and she described\nstraightforwardly how she had found the pistol on the floor near the\nprostrate figure of Cory, and hidden it in her own dress.  The\nattorneys for the State listened with a somewhat cynical amusement to\nthis portion of her testimony, believing it of no account,\nuncorroborated, and that if necessary the State could impeach the\nwitness on the ground that it had been indispensable to produce her.\nShe came down weeping from the stand; and, the next witness not being\nimmediately called, the eyes of the jurymen naturally followed her as\nshe passed to her seat, and they saw Ariel Tabor bow gravely to her\nacross the railing.  Now, a thousand things not set forth by\nlegislatures, law-men and judges affect a jury, and the slight\nsalutation caused the members of this one to glance at one another; for\nit seemed to imply that the exquisite lady in white not only knew\nClaudine, but knew that she had spoken the truth.  It was after this,\nthat a feeling favorable to the defence now and then noticeably\nmanifested itself in the courtroom.  Still, when the evidence for the\nState was all in, the life of Happy Fear seemed to rest in a balance\nprecarious indeed, and the little man, swallowing pitifully, looked at\nhis attorney with the eyes of a sick dog.\n\nThen Joe gave the prosecutors an illuminating and stunning surprise,\nand, having offered in evidence the revolver found upon Claudine,\nproduced as his first witness a pawnbroker of Denver, who identified\nthe weapon as one he had sold to Cory, whom he had known very well.\nThe second witness, also a stranger, had been even more intimately\nacquainted with the dead man, and there began to be an uneasy\ncomprehension of what Joe had accomplished during that prolonged\nabsence of his which had so nearly cost the life of the little mongrel,\nwho was at present (most blissful Respectability!) a lively\nconvalescent in Ariel's back yard.  The second witness also identified\nthe revolver, testifying that he had borrowed it from Cory in St. Louis\nto settle a question of marksmanship, and that on his returning it to\nthe owner, the latter, then working his way eastward, had confided to\nhim his intention of stopping in Canaan for the purpose of exercising\nits melancholy functions upon a man who had once \"done him good\" in\nthat city.\n\nBy the time the witness had reached this point, the Prosecutor and his\nassistants were on their feet, excitedly shouting objections, which\nwere promptly overruled.  Taken unawares, they fought for time; thunder\nwas loosed, forensic bellowings; everybody lost his temper--except Joe;\nand the examination of the witness proceeded.  Cory, with that singular\ninspiration to confide in some one, which is the characteristic and the\nundoing of his kind, had outlined his plan of operations to the witness\nwith perfect clarity.  He would first attempt, so he had declared, to\nincite an attack upon himself by playing upon the jealousy of his\nvictim, having already made a tentative effort in that direction.\nFailing in this, he would fall back upon one of a dozen schemes (for he\nwas ready in such matters, he bragged), the most likely of which would\nbe to play the peacemaker; he would talk of his good intentions toward\nhis enemy, speaking publicly of him in friendly and gentle ways; then,\ngetting at him secretly, destroy him in such a fashion as to leave open\nfor himself the kind gate of self-defence.  In brief, here was the\nwhole tally of what had actually occurred, with the exception of the\nlast account in the sequence which had proved that demise for which\nCory had not arranged and it fell from the lips of a witness whom the\nprosecution had no means of impeaching. When he left the stand,\nunshaken and undiscredited, after a frantic cross-examination, Joe,\nturning to resume his seat, let his hand fall lightly for a second upon\nhis client's shoulder.\n\nThat was the occasion of a demonstration which indicated a sentiment\nfavorable to the defence (on the part of at least three of the\nspectators); and it was in the nature of such a hammering of canes upon\nthe bare wooden floor as effectually stopped all other proceedings\ninstantly.  The indignant Judge fixed the Colonel, Peter Bradbury, and\nSquire Buckalew with his glittering eye, yet the hammering continued\nunabated; and the offenders surely would have been conducted forth in\nignominy, had not gallantry prevailed, even in that formal place.  The\nJudge, reluctantly realizing that some latitude must be allowed to\nthese aged enthusiasts, since they somehow seemed to belong to Miss\nTabor, made his remarks general, with the time-worn threat to clear the\nroom, whereupon the loyal survivors of Eskew relapsed into unabashed\nsilence.\n\nIt was now, as Joe had said, a clear-enough case. Only the case itself,\nhowever, was clear, for, as he and his friends feared, the verdict\nmight possibly be neither in accordance with the law, the facts, nor\nthe convictions of the jury.  Eugene's defection had not altered the\ntone of the Tocsin.\n\nAll day long a crowd of men and boys hung about the corridors of the\nCourt-house, about the Square and the neighboring streets, and from\nthese rose sombre murmurs, more and more ominous. The public sentiment\nof a community like Canaan can make itself felt inside a court-room;\nand it was strongly exerted against Happy Fear. The Tocsin had always\nbeen a powerful agent; Judge Pike had increased its strength with a\nstaff which was thoroughly efficient, alert, and always able to strike\ncentre with the paper's readers; and in town and country it had\nabsorbed the circulation of the other local journals, which resisted\nfeebly at times, but in the matter of the Cory murder had not dared to\ndo anything except follow the Tocsin's lead.  The Tocsin, having lit\nthe fire, fed it--fed it saltpetre and sulphur--for now Martin Pike was\nfighting hard.\n\nThe farmers and people of the less urban parts of the country were\naccustomed to found their opinions upon the Tocsin.  They regarded it\nas the single immutable rock of journalistic righteousness and wisdom\nin the world.  Consequently, stirred by the outbursts of the paper,\nthey came into Canaan in great numbers, and though the pressure from\nthe town itself was so strong that only a few of them managed to crowd\ninto the court-room, the others joined their voices to those sombre\nmurmurs outdoors, which increased in loudness as the trial went on.\n\nThe Tocsin, however, was not having everything its own way; the volume\nof outcry against Happy Fear and his lawyer had diminished, it was\nnoticed, in \"very respectable quarters.\"  The information imparted by\nMike Sheehan to the politicians at Mr. Farbach's had been slowly\nseeping through the various social strata of the town, and though at\nfirst incredulously rejected, it began to find acceptance; Upper Main\nStreet cooling appreciably in its acceptance of the Tocsin as the law\nand the prophets.  There were even a few who dared to wonder in their\nhearts if there had not been a mistake about Joe Louden; and although\nMrs. Flitcroft weakened not, the relatives of Squire Buckalew and of\nPeter Bradbury began to hold up their heads a little, after having made\nhome horrible for those gentlemen and reproached them with their\nconversion as the last word of senile shame.  In addition, the\nColonel's grandson and Mr. Bradbury's grandson had both mystifyingly\nlent countenance to Joe, consorting with him openly; the former for his\nown purposes--the latter because he had cunningly discovered that it\nwas a way to Miss Tabor's regard, which, since her gentle rejection of\nhim, he had grown to believe (good youth!) might be the pleasantest\nthing that could ever come to him.  In short, the question had begun to\nthrive:  Was it possible that Eskew Arp had not been insane, after all?\n\nThe best of those who gathered ominously about the Court-house and its\npurlieus were the young farmers and field-hands, artisans and clerks;\none of the latter being a pimply faced young man (lately from the\ndoctor's hands), who limped, and would limp for the rest of his life,\nhe who, of all men, held the memory of Eskew Arp in least respect, and\nwas burningly desirous to revenge himself upon the living.\n\nThe worst were of that mystifying, embryonic, semi-rowdy type, the\nAmerican voyou, in the production of which Canaan and her sister towns\neverywhere over the country are prolific; the young man, youth, boy\nperhaps, creature of nameless age, whose clothes are like those of a\nbrakeman out of work, but who is not a brakeman in or out of work;\nwearing the black, soft hat tilted forward to shelter--as a counter\ndoes the contempt of a clerk--that expression which the face does not\ndare wear quite in the open, asserting the possession of supreme\ncapacity in wit, strength, dexterity, and amours; the dirty\nhandkerchief under the collar; the short black coat always\ndouble-breasted; the eyelids sooty; one cheek always bulged; the\nforehead speckled; the lips cracked; horrible teeth; and the\naffectation of possessing secret information upon all matters of the\nuniverse; above all, the instinct of finding the shortest way to any\nscene of official interest to the policeman, fireman, or ambulance\nsurgeon,--a singular being, not professionally criminal; tough\nhistrionically rather than really; full of its own argot of brag;\nhysterical when crossed, timid through great ignorance, and therefore\ndangerous.  It furnishes not the leaders but the mass of mobs; and it\nsprings up at times of crisis from Heaven knows where.  You might have\ndriven through all the streets of Canaan, a week before the trial, and\nhave seen four or five such fellows; but from the day of its beginning\nthe Square was full of them, dingy shuttlecocks batted up into view by\nthe Tocsin.\n\nThey kept the air whirring with their noise. The news of that sitting\nwhich had caused the Squire, Flitcroft, and Peter Bradbury to risk the\nCourt's displeasure, was greeted outside with loud and vehement\ndisfavor; and when, at noon, the jurymen were marshalled out to cross\nthe yard to the \"National House\" for dinner, a large crowd followed and\nsurrounded them, until they reached the doors of the hotel.  \"Don't let\nLawyer Louden bamboozle you!\"  \"Hang him!\"  \"Tar and feathers fer ye ef\nye don't hang him!\"  These were the mildest threats, and Joe Louden,\nwatching from an upper window of the Court-house, observed with a\ntroubled eye how certain of the jury shrank from the pressure of the\nthrong, how the cheeks of others showed sudden pallor.  Sometimes\n\"public sentiment\" has done evil things to those who have not shared\nit; and Joe knew how rare a thing is a jury which dares to stand square\nagainst a town like Canaan aroused.\n\nThe end of that afternoon's session saw another point marked for the\ndefence; Joe had put the defendant on the stand, and the little man had\nproved an excellent witness.  During his life he had been many\nthings--many things disreputable; high standards were not brightly\nillumined for him in the beginning of the night-march which his life\nhad been.  He had been a tramp, afterward a petty gambler; but his\ngreat motive had finally come to be the intention to do what Joe told\nhim to do: that, and to keep Claudine as straight as he could.  In a\nmeasure, these were the two things that had brought him to the pass in\nwhich he now stood, his loyalty to Joe and his resentment of whatever\ntampered with Claudine's straightness. He was submissive to the\nconsequences: he was still loyal.  And now Joe asked him to tell \"just\nwhat happened,\" and Happy obeyed with crystal clearness.  Throughout\nthe long, tricky cross-examination he continued to tell \"just what\nhappened\" with a plaintive truthfulness not to be imitated, and\nthroughout it Joe guarded him from pitfalls (for lawyers in their\nsearch after truth are compelled by the exigencies of their profession\nto make pitfalls even for the honest), and gave him, by various\ndevices, time to remember, though not to think, and made the words\n\"come right\" in his mouth.  So that before the sitting was over, a\ndisquieting rumor ran through the waiting crowd in the corridors,\nacross the Square, and over the town, that the case was surely going\n\"Louden's way.\"  This was also the opinion of a looker-on in Canaan--a\nferret-faced counsellor of corporations who, called to consultation\nwith the eminent Buckalew (nephew of the Squire), had afterward spent\nan hour in his company at the trial.  \"It's going that young fellow\nLouden's way,\" said the stranger.  \"You say he's a shyster, but--\"\n\n\"Well,\" admitted Buckalew, with some reluctance, \"I don't mean that\nexactly.  I've got an old uncle who seems lately to think he's a great\nman.\"\n\n\"I'll take your uncle's word for it,\" returned the other, smiling.  \"I\nthink he'll go pretty far.\"\n\nThey had come to the flight of steps which descended to the yard,--and\nthe visitor, looking down upon the angry crowd, added, \"If they don't\nkill him!\"\n\nJoe himself was anxious concerning no such matter.  He shook hands with\nHappy at the end of the sitting, bidding him be of good cheer, and,\nwhen the little man had marched away, under a strong guard, began to\ngather and sort his papers at a desk inside the bar.  This took him\nperhaps five minutes, and when he had finished there were only three\npeople left in the room: a clerk, a negro janitor with a broom, and the\ndarky friend who always hopefully accompanies a colored man holding\nhigh public office.  These two approvingly greeted the young lawyer,\nthe janitor handing him a note from Norbert Flitcroft, and the friend\nmechanically \"borrowing\" a quarter from him as he opened the envelope.\n\n\"I'll be roun' yo' way to git a box o' SE-gahs,\" laughed the friend,\n\"soon ez de campaign open up good.  Dey all goin' vote yo' way, down on\nthe levee bank, but dey sho' expecks to git to smoke a little 'fo'\nleckshun-day!  We knows who's OW frien'!\"\n\nNorbert's missive was lengthy and absorbing; Joe went on his way,\nperusing it with profound attention; but as he descended the stairway\nto the floor below, a loud burst of angry shouting, outside the\nbuilding, caused him to hasten toward the big front doors which faced\nMain Street.  The doors opened upon an imposing vestibule, from which a\nhandsome flight of stone steps, protected by a marble balustrade, led\nto the ground.\n\nStanding at the top of these steps and leaning over the balustrade, he\nhad a clear view of half the yard.  No one was near him; everybody was\nrunning in the opposite direction, toward that corner of the yard\noccupied by the jail, the crowd centring upon an agitated whirlpool of\nmen which moved slowly toward a door in the high wall that enclosed the\nbuilding; and Joe saw that Happy Fear's guards, conducting the prisoner\nback to his cell, were being jostled and rushed.  The distance they had\nmade was short, but as they reached the door the pressure upon them\nincreased dangerously. Clubs rose in the air, hats flew, the whirlpool\nheaved tumultuously, and the steel door clanged.\n\nHappy Fear was safe inside, but the jostlers were outside--baffled,\nugly, and stirred with the passion that changes a crowd into a mob.\n\nThen some of them caught sight of Joe as he stood alone at the top of\nthe steps, and a great shout of rage and exultation arose.\n\nFor a moment or two he did not see his danger. At the clang of the\ndoor, his eyes, caught by the gleam of a wide white hat, had turned\ntoward the street, and he was somewhat fixedly watching Mr. Ladew\nextricate Ariel (and her aged and indignant escorts) from an overflow\nof the crowd in which they had been caught.  But a voice warned him:\nthe wild piping of a newsboy who had climbed into a tree near by.\n\n\"JOE LOUDEN!\" he screamed.  \"LOOK OUT!\"\n\nWith a muffled roar the crowd surged back from the jail and turned\ntoward the steps.  \"Tar and feather him!\"  \"Take him over to the river\nand throw him in!\"  \"Drown him!\"  \"Hang him!\"\n\nThen a thing happened which was dramatic enough in its inception, but\nalmost ludicrous in its effect.  Joe walked quietly down the steps and\ntoward the advancing mob with his head cocked to one side, one eyebrow\nlifted, and one corner of his mouth drawn down in a faintly distorted\nsmile.\n\nHe went straight toward the yelling forerunners, with only a small\nbundle of papers in his hands, and then--while the non-partisan\nspectators held their breath, expecting the shock of contact--straight\non through them.\n\nA number of the bulge-cheeked formed the scattering van of these\nforerunners, charging with hoarse and cruel shrieks of triumph.  The\nfirst, apparently about to tear Joseph Louden to pieces, changed\ncountenance at arm's-length, swerved violently, and with the loud cry,\n\"HEAD HIM OFF!\" dashed on up the stone steps.  The man next behind him\nfollowed his lead, with the same shout, strategy, and haste; then the\nothers of this advance attack, finding themselves confronting the quiet\nman, who kept his even pace and showed no intention of turning aside\nfor them, turned suddenly aside for HIM, and, taking the cue from the\nfirst, pursued their way, bellowing:  \"HEAD HIM OFF! HEAD HIM OFF!\"\nuntil there were a dozen and more rowdyish men and youths upon the\nsteps, their eyes blazing with fury, menacing Louden's back with\nfrightful gestures across the marble balustrade, as they hysterically\nbleated the chorus, \"HEAD HIM OFF!\"\n\nWhether or not Joe could have walked through the entire mob as he had\nwalked through these is a matter for speculation; it was believed in\nCanaan that he could.  Already a gust of mirth began to sweep over the\nsterner spirits as they paused to marvel no less at the disconcerting\nadvance of the lawyer than at the spectacle presented by the intrepid\ndare-devils upon the steps; a kind of lane actually opening before the\nyoung man as he walked steadily on.  And when Mr. Sheehan, leading half\na dozen huge men from the Farbach brewery, unceremoniously shouldered a\nway through the mob to Joe's side, reaching him where the press was\nthickest, it is a question if the services of his detachment were\nneeded.\n\nThe laughter increased.  It became voluminous. Homeric salvos shook the\nair.  And never one of the fire-eaters upon the steps lived long enough\nto live down the hateful cry of that day, \"HEAD HIM OFF!\" which was to\nbecome a catch-word on the streets, a taunt more stinging than any\ndevised by deliberate invention, an insult bitterer than the ancestral\ndoubt, a fighting-word, and the great historical joke of Canaan, never\nomitted in after-days when the tale was told how Joe Louden took that\nshort walk across the Court-house yard which made him Mayor of Canaan.\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nMARTIN PIKE KEEPS AN ENGAGEMENT\n\nAn hour later, Martin Pike, looking forth from the Mansion, saw a man\nopen the gate, and, passing between the unemotional deer, rapidly\napproach the house.  He was a thin young fellow, very well dressed in\ndark gray, his hair prematurely somewhat silvered, his face prematurely\nsomewhat lined, and his hat covered a scar such as might have been\ncaused by a blow from a blunt instrument in the nature of a poker.\n\nHe did not reach the door, nor was there necessity for him to ring,\nfor, before he had set foot on the lowest step, the Judge had hastened\nto meet him.  Not, however, with any fulsomely hospitable intent; his\nhand and arm were raised to execute one of his Olympian gestures, of\nthe kind which had obliterated the young man upon a certain by-gone\nmorning.\n\nLouden looked up calmly at the big figure towering above him.\n\n\"It won't do, Judge,\" he said; that was all, but there was a\nsignificance in his manner and a certainty in his voice which caused\nthe uplifted hand to drop limply; while the look of apprehension which\nof late had grown more and more to be Martin Pike's habitual expression\ndeepened into something close upon mortal anxiety.\n\n\"Have you any business to set foot upon my property?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Joe.  \"That's why I came.\"\n\n\"What business have you got with me?\"\n\n\"Enough to satisfy you, I think.  But there's one thing I don't want to\ndo\"--Joe glanced at the open door--\"and that is to talk about it\nhere--for your own sake and because I think Miss Tabor should be\npresent.  I called to ask you to come to her house at eight o'clock\nto-night.\"\n\n\"You did!\" Martin Pike spoke angrily, but not in the bull-bass of yore;\nand he kept his voice down, glancing about him nervously as though he\nfeared that his wife or Mamie might hear. \"My accounts with her estate\nare closed,\" he said, harshly.  \"If she wants anything, let her come\nhere.\"\n\nJoe shook his head.  \"No.  You must be there at eight o'clock.\"\n\nThe Judge's choler got the better of his uneasiness. \"You're a pretty\none to come ordering me around!\" he broke out.  \"You slanderer, do you\nsuppose I haven't heard how you're going about traducing me,\nundermining my character in this community, spreading scandals that I\nam the real owner of Beaver Beach--\"\n\n\"It can easily be proved, Judge,\" Joe interrupted, quietly, \"though\nyou're wrong: I haven't been telling people.  I haven't needed to--even\nif I'd wished.  Once a thing like that gets out you can't stop\nit--ever!  That isn't all: to my knowledge you own other property worse\nthan the Beach; I know that you own half of the worst dens in the town:\nprofitable investments, too.  You bought them very gradually and\ncraftily, only showing the deeds to those in charge--as you did to Mike\nSheehan, and not recording them.  Sheehan's betrayal of you gave me the\nkey; I know most of the poor creatures who are your tenants, too, you\nsee, and that gave me an advantage because they have some confidence in\nme.  My investigations have been almost as quiet and careful as your\npurchases.\"\n\n\"You damned blackmailer!\"  The Judge bent upon him a fierce, inquiring\nscrutiny in which, oddly enough, there was a kind of haggard\nhopefulness. \"And out of such stories,\" he sneered, \"you are going to\ntry to make political capital against the Tocsin, are you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Joe.  \"It was necessary in the interests of my client for me\nto know pretty thoroughly just what property you own, and I think I do.\nThese pieces I've mentioned are about all you have not mortgaged.  You\ncouldn't do that without exposure, and you've kept a controlling\ninterest in the Tocsin clear, too--for the sake of its influence, I\nsuppose.  Now, do you want to hear any more, or will you agree to meet\nme at Miss Tabor's this evening?\"\n\nWhatever the look of hopefulness had signified, it fled from Pike's\nface during this speech, but he asked with some show of contempt, \"Do\nyou think it likely?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Joe, \"if you want me to speak here.\"  And he came a\nlittle closer to him. \"You bought a big block of Granger Gas for Roger\nTabor,\" he began, in a low voice.  \"Before his death you sold\neverything he had, except the old house, put it all into cash for him,\nand bought that stock; you signed the check as his attorney-in-fact,\nand it came back to you through the Washington National, where Norbert\nFlitcroft handled it.  He has a good memory, and when he told me what\nhe knew, I had him to do some tracing; did a little myself, also.\nJudge Pike, I must tell you that you stand in danger of the law.  You\nwere the custodian of that stock for Roger Tabor; it was transferred in\nblank; though I think you meant to be 'legal' at that time, and that\nwas merely for convenience in case Roger had wished you to sell it for\nhim.  But just after his death you found yourself saddled with\ndistillery stock, which was going bad on your hands.  Other\nspeculations of yours were failing at the same time; you had to have\nmoney--you filed your report as administrator, crediting Miss Tabor\nwith your own stock which you knew was going to the wall, and\ntransferred hers to yourself.  Then you sold it because you needed\nready money.  You used her fortune to save yourself--but you were\nhorribly afraid! No matter how rotten your transactions had been, you\nhad always kept inside the law; and now that you had gone outside of\nit, you were frightened. You didn't dare come flat out to Miss Tabor\nwith the statement that her fortune had gone; it had been in your\ncharge all the time and things might look ugly.  So you put it off,\nperhaps from day to day.  You didn't dare tell her until you were\nforced to, and to avoid the confession you sent her the income which\nwas rightfully hers.  That was your great weakness.\"\n\nJoe had spoken with great rapidity, though keeping his voice low, and\nhe lowered it again, as he continued:  \"Judge Pike, what chance have\nyou to be believed in court when you swear that you sent her twenty\nthousand dollars out of the goodness of your heart?  Do you think SHE\nbelieved you?  It was the very proof to her that you had robbed her.\nFor she knew you!  Do you want to hear more now?  Do you think this is\na good place for it?  Do you wish me to go over the details of each\nstep I have taken against you, to land you at the bar where this poor\nfellow your paper is hounding stands to-day?\"\n\nThe Judge essayed to answer, and could not. He lifted his hand\nuncertainly and dropped it, while a thick dew gathered on his temples.\nInarticulate sounds came from between his teeth.\n\n\"You will come?\" said Joe.\n\nMartin Pike bent his head dazedly; and at that the other turned quickly\nfrom him and went away without looking back.\n\n\nAriel was in the studio, half an hour later, when Joe was announced by\nthe smiling Mr. Warden. Ladew was with her, though upon the point of\ntaking his leave, and Joe marked (with a sinking heart) that the young\nminister's cheeks were flushed and his eyes very bright.\n\n\"It was a magnificent thing you did, Mr. Louden,\" he said, offering his\nhand heartily; \"I saw it, and it was even finer in one way than it was\nplucky.  It somehow straightened things out with such perfect good\nnature; it made those people feel that what they were doing was\nridiculous.\"\n\n\"So it was,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Few, under the circumstances, could have acted as if they thought so!\nAnd I hope you'll let me call upon you, Mr. Louden.\"\n\n\"I hope you will,\" he answered; and then, when the minister had\ndeparted, stood looking after him with sad eyes, in which there dwelt\nobscure meditations. Ladew's word of farewell had covered a deep look\nat Ariel, which was not to be mistaken by Joseph Louden for anything\nother than what it was: the clergyman's secret was an open one, and Joe\nsaw that he was as frank and manly in love as in all other things.\n\"He's a good fellow,\" he said at last, sighing.  \"A good man.\"\n\nAriel agreed.  \"And he said more to me than he did to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think it probable,\" Joe smiled sorrowfully.\n\n\"About YOU, I mean.\"  He had time to fear that her look admitted\nconfusion before she proceeded:  \"He said he had never seen anything so\nfine as your coming down those steps.  Ah, he was right!  But it was\nharder for me to watch you, I think, than for you to do it, Joe.  I was\nso horribly afraid--and the crowd between us--if we could have got near\nyou--but we couldn't--we--\"\n\nShe faltered, and pressed her hand close upon her eyes.\n\n\"We?\" asked Joe, slowly.  \"You mean you and Mr. Ladew?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was there; but I mean\"--her voice ran into a little laugh with\na beatific quaver in it--\"I mean Colonel Flitcroft and Mr. Bradbury and\nMr. Buckalew, too--we were hemmed in together when Mr. Ladew found\nus--and, oh, Joe, when that cowardly rush started toward you, those\nthree--I've heard wonderful things in Paris and Naples, cabmen\nquarrelling and disappointed beggars--but never anything like them\nto-day--\"\n\n\"You mean they were profane?\"\n\n\"Oh, magnificently--and with such inventiveness! All three begged my\npardon afterwards.  I didn't grant it--I blessed them!\"\n\n\"Did they beg Mr. Ladew's pardon?\"\n\n\"Ah, Joe!\" she reproached him.  \"He isn't a prig.  And he's had to\nfight some things that you of all men ought to understand.  He's only\nbeen here a few months, but he told me that Judge Pike has been against\nhim from the start.  It seems that Mr. Ladew is too liberal in his\nviews.  And he told me that if it were not for Judge Pike's losing\ninfluence in the church on account of the Beaver Beach story, the Judge\nwould probably have been able to force him to resign; but now he will\nstay.\"\n\n\"He wishes to stay, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Very much, I think.  And, Joe,\" she continued, thoughtfully, \"I want\nyou to do something for me. I want you to go to church with me next\nSunday.\"\n\n\"To hear Mr. Ladew?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I wouldn't ask except for that.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he consented, with averted eyes. \"I'll go.\"\n\nHer face was radiant with the smile she gave him.  \"It will make me\nvery happy,\" she said.\n\nHe bent his head and fumbled over some papers he had taken from his\npocket.  \"Will you listen to these memoranda?  We have a great deal to\ngo over before eight o'clock.\"\n\n\nJudge Pike stood for a long while where Joe had left him, staring out\nat the street, apparently. Really he saw nothing.  Undoubtedly an image\nof blurring foliage, cast-iron, cement, and turf, with sunshine smeared\nover all, flickered upon the retinas of his eyes; but the brain did not\naccept the picture from the optic nerve.  Martin Pike was busy with\nother visions.  Joe Louden had followed him back to his hidden deeds\nand had read them aloud to him as Gabriel would read them on\nJudgment-day.  Perhaps THIS was the Judgment-day.\n\nPike had taken charge of Roger Tabor's affairs because the commissions\nas agent were not too inconsiderable to be neglected.  To make the task\nsimpler, he had sold, as time went on, the various properties of the\nestate, gradually converting all of them into cash.  Then, the\nopportunity offering, he bought a stock which paid excellent dividends,\nhad it transferred in blank, because if it should prove to Roger's\nadvantage to sell it, his agent could do so without any formal delays\nbetween Paris and Canaan.  At least, that is what the Judge had told\nhimself at the time, though it may be that some lurking whisperer in\nhis soul had hinted that it might be well to preserve the great amount\nof cash in hand, and Roger's stock was practically that.  Then came the\nevil days.  Laboriously, he had built up a name for conservatism which\nmost of the town accepted, but secretly he had always been a gambler:\nWall Street was his goal; to adventure there, as one of the great\nsingle-eyed Cyclopean man-eaters, his fond ambition; and he had\nconceived the distillery trust as a means to attain it; but the\nstructure tumbled about his ears; other edifices of his crumbled at the\nsame time; he found himself beset, his solvency endangered, and there\nwas the Tabor stock, quite as good as gold; Roger had just died, and it\nwas enough to save him.--Save?  That was a strange way to be\nremembering it to-day, when Fate grinned at him out of a dreadful mask\ncontorted like the face of Norbert Flitcroft.\n\nMartin Pike knew himself for a fool.  What chance had he, though he\ndestroyed the check a thousand times over, to escape the records by\nwhich the coil of modern trade duplicates and quadruplicates each slip\nof scribbled paper?  What chance had he against the memories of men?\nWould the man of whom he had bought, forget that the check was signed\nby Roger's agent?  Had the bank-clerk forgotten?  Thrice fool, Martin\nPike, to dream that in a town like Canaan, Norbert or any of his kind\ncould touch an order for so great a sum and forget it!  But Martin Pike\nhad not dreamed that; had dreamed nothing.  When failure confronted him\nhis mind refused to consider anything but his vital need at the time,\nand he had supplied that need.  And now he grew busy with the future:\nhe saw first the civil suit for restitution, pressed with the ferocity\nand cunning of one who intended to satisfy a grudge of years; then,\nperhaps, a criminal prosecution....  But he would fight it!  Did they\nthink that such a man was to be overthrown by a breath of air?  By a\ngirl, a bank-clerk, and a shyster lawyer?  They would find their case\ndifficult to prove in court. He did not believe they COULD prove it.\nThey would be discredited for the attempt upon him and he would win\nclear; these Beaver Beach scandals would die of inertia presently;\nthere would be a lucky trick in wheat, and Martin Pike would be Martin\nPike once more; reinstated, dictator of church, politics, business; all\nthose things which were the breath of his life restored.  He would show\nthis pitiful pack what manner of man they hounded!  Norbert\nFlitcroft....\n\nThe Judge put his big hand up to his eyes and rubbed them.  Curious\nmechanisms the eyes.... That deer in line with the vision--not a zebra?\nA zebra after all these years?  And yet ... curious, indeed, the eyes!\n... a zebra....  Who ever heard of a deer with stripes?  The big hand\nrose from the eyes and ran through the hair which he had always worn\nrather long.  It would seem strange to have it cut very short....  Did\nthey use clippers, perhaps? ...\n\nHe started suddenly and realized that his next-door neighbor had passed\nalong the sidewalk with head averted, pretending not to see him.  A few\nweeks ago the man would not have missed the chance of looking in to\nbow--with proper deference, too!  Did he know?  He could not know THIS!\nIt must be the Beaver Beach scandal.  It must be. It could not be\nTHIS--not yet!  But it MIGHT be. How many knew?  Louden, Norbert,\nAriel--who else? And again the deer took on the strange zebra look.\n\nThe Judge walked slowly down to the gate; spoke to the man he had\nemployed in Sam Warden's place, a Scotchman who had begun to refresh\nthe lawn with a garden hose; bowed affably in response to the\nsalutation of the elder Louden, who was passing, bound homeward from\nthe factory, and returned to the house with thoughtful steps.  In the\nhall he encountered his wife; stopped to speak with her upon various\nhousehold matters; then entered the library, which was his workroom.\nHe locked the door; tried it, and shook the handle. After satisfying\nhimself of its security, he pulled down the window-shades carefully,\nand, lighting a gas drop-lamp upon his desk, began to fumble with\nvarious documents, which he took from a small safe near by.  But his\nhands were not steady; he dropped the papers, scattering them over the\nfloor, and had great difficulty in picking them up. He perspired\nheavily: whatever he touched became damp, and he continually mopped his\nforehead with his sleeve.  After a time he gave up the attempt to sort\nthe packets of papers; sank into a chair despairingly, leaving most of\nthem in disorder. A light tap sounded on the door.\n\n\"Martin, it's supper-time.\"\n\nWith a great effort he made shift to answer: \"Yes, I know.  You and\nMamie go ahead.  I'm too busy to-night.  I don't want anything.\"\n\nA moment before, he had been a pitiful figure, face distraught, hands\nincoherent, the whole body incoordinate, but if eyes might have rested\nupon him as he answered his wife they would have seen a strange thing;\nhe sat, apparently steady and collected, his expression cool, his body\nquiet, poised exactly to the quality of his reply, for the same strange\nreason that a young girl smiles archly and coquettes to a telephone.\n\n\"But, Martin, you oughtn't to work so hard. You'll break down--\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" he replied, cheerfully.  \"You can leave something on\nthe sideboard for me.\"\n\nAfter another fluttering remonstrance, she went away, and the room was\nsilent again.  His arms rested upon the desk, and his head slowly sank\nbetween his elbows.  When he lifted it again the clock on the\nmantel-piece had tinkled once.  It was half-past seven.  He took a\nsheet of note-paper from a box before him and began to write, but when\nhe had finished the words, \"My dear wife and Mamie,\" his fingers shook\nso violently that he could go no further.  He placed his left hand over\nthe back of his right to steady it, but found the device unavailing:\nthe pen left mere zigzags on the page, and he dropped it.\n\nHe opened a lower drawer of the desk and took out of it a pistol; rose,\nwent to the door, tried it once more, and again was satisfied of his\nseclusion. Then he took the weapon in both hands, the handle against\nhis fingers, one thumb against the trigger, and, shaking with nausea,\nlifted it to the level of his eyes.  His will betrayed him; he could\nnot contract his thumb upon the trigger, and, with a convulsive shiver,\nhe dropped the revolver upon the desk.\n\nHe locked the door of the room behind him, crept down the stairs and\nout of the front-door. He walked shamblingly, when he reached the\nstreet, keeping close to the fences as he went on, now and then\ntouching the pickets with his hands like a feeble old man.\n\nHe had always been prompt; it was one of the things of which he had\nbeen proud: in all his life he had never failed to keep a business\nengagement precisely upon the appointed time, and the Court-house bell\nclanged eight when Sam Warden opened the door for his old employer\nto-night.\n\nThe two young people looked up gravely from the script-laden table\nbefore them as Martin Pike came into the strong lamplight out of the\ndimness of the hall, where only a taper burned.  He shambled a few limp\nsteps into the room and came to a halt.  Big as he was, his clothes\nhung upon him loosely, like coverlets upon a collapsed bed; and he\nseemed but a distorted image of himself, as if (save for the dull and\nreddened eyes) he had been made of yellowish wax and had been left too\nlong in the sun.  Abject, hopeless, his attitude a confession of ruin\nand shame, he stood before his judges in such wretchedness that, in\ncomparison, the figure of Happy Fear, facing the court-room through his\ndarkest hour, was one to be envied.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, brokenly, \"what are you going to do?\"\n\nJoe Louden looked at him with great intentness for several moments.\nThen he rose and came forward.  \"Sit down, Judge,\" he said.  \"It's all\nright.  Don't worry.\"\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nTHE JURY COMES IN\n\nMrs. Flitcroft, at breakfast on the following morning, continued a\ndisquisition which had ceased, the previous night, only because of a\nprovoking human incapacity to exist without sleep.  Her theme was one\nwhich had exclusively occupied her since the passing of Eskew, and, her\nrheumatism having improved so that she could leave her chair, she had\nbecome a sort of walking serial; Norbert and his grandfather being well\nassured that, whenever they left the house, the same story was to be\ncontinued upon their reappearance.  The Tocsin had been her great\ncomfort: she was but one helpless woman against two strong men;\ntherefore she sorely needed assistance in her attack upon them, and the\ninvaluable newspaper gave it in generous measure.\n\n\"Yes, young man,\" she said, as she lifted her first spoonful of\noatmeal, \"you BETTER read the Tocsin!\"\n\n\"I AM reading it,\" responded Norbert, who was almost concealed by the\npaper.\n\n\"And your grandfather better read it!\" she continued, severely.\n\n\"I already have,\" said the Colonel, promptly. \"Have you?\"\n\n\"No, but you can be sure I will!\"  The good lady gave the effect of\ntossing her head.  \"And you better take what it says to heart, you and\nsome others.  It's a wonder to me that you and Buckalew and old Peter\ndon't go and hold that Happy Fear's hand durin' the trial!  And as for\nJoe Louden, his step-mother's own sister, Jane, says to me only\nyesterday afternoon, 'Why, law! Mrs. Flitcroft,' she says, 'it's a\nwonder to me,' she says, 'that your husband and those two other old\nfools don't lay down in the gutter and let that Joe Louden walk over\n'em.'\"\n\n\"Did Jane Quimby say 'those two other old fools'?\" inquired the\nColonel, in a manner which indicated that he might see Mr. Quimby in\nregard to the slander.\n\n\"I can't say as I remember just precisely her exact words,\" admitted\nMrs. Flitcroft, \"but that was the sense of 'em!  You've made yourselves\nthe laughin'-stock of the whole town!\"\n\n\"Oh, we have?\"\n\n\"And I'd like to know\"--her voice became shrill and goading--\"I'd like\nto know what Judge Pike thinks of you and Norbert!  I should think\nyou'd be ashamed to have him pass you in the street.\"\n\n\"I've quit speaking to him,\" said Norbert, coldly, \"ever since I heard\nhe owned Beaver Beach.\"\n\n\"That story ain't proved yet!\" returned his grandmother, with much\nirascibility.\n\n\"Well, it will be; but that's not all.\"  Norbert wagged his head.  \"You\nmay be a little surprised within the next few days.\"\n\n\"I've been surprised for the PAST few!\" she replied, with a bitterness\nwhich overrode her satisfaction in the effectiveness of the retort.\n\"Surprised!  I'd like to know who wouldn't be surprised when half the\ntown acts like it's gone crazy. People PRAISIN' that fellow, that\nnobody in their sober minds and senses never in their lives had a good\nword for before!  Why, there was more talk yesterday about his doin's\nat the Court-house--you'd of thought he was Phil Sheridan!  It's 'Joe\nLouden' here and 'Joe Louden' there, and 'Joe Louden' this and 'Joe\nLouden' that, till I'm sick of the name!\"\n\n\"Then why don't you quit saying it?\" asked the Colonel, reasonably.\n\n\"Because it'd OUGHT to be said!\" she exclaimed, with great heat.\n\"Because he'd ought to be held up to the community to be despised.  You\nlet me have that paper a minute,\" she pursued, vehemently; \"you just\nlet me have the Tocsin and I'll read you out some things about him that\n'll show him in his true light!\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Norbert, suddenly handing her the paper.  \"Go ahead.\"\n\nAnd after the exchange of a single glance the two gentlemen composed\nthemselves to listen.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Mrs. Flitcroft.  \"Here it is in head-lines on the first\npage.  'Defence Scores Again and Again.  Ridiculous Behavior of a\nWould-Be Mob.  Louden's--'\"  She paused, removed her spectacles,\nexamined them dubiously, restored them to place, and continued:\n\"'Louden's Masterly Conduct and Well-Deserved--'\" she paused again,\nincredulous--\"'Well-Deserved Triumph--'\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said the Colonel, softly.\n\n\"Indeed I will!\" the old lady replied.  \"Do you think I don't know\nsarcasm when I see it?  Ha, ha!\"  She laughed with great heartiness.\n\"I reckon I WILL go on!  You listen and try to LEARN something from\nit!\"  She resumed the reading:\n\n\"'It is generally admitted that after yesterday's sitting of the court,\nthe prosecution in the Fear-Cory murder trial has not a leg to stand\non.  Louden's fight for his client has been, it must be confessed, of a\nmost splendid and talented order, and the bottom has fallen out of the\ncase for the State, while a verdict of Not Guilty, it is now conceded,\nis the general wish of those who have attended and followed the trial.\nBut the most interesting event of the day took place after the session,\nwhen some miscreants undertook to mob the attorney for the defence in\nthe Court-house yard.  He met the attack with a coolness and nerve\nwhich have won him a popularity that--'\" Mrs. Flitcroft again faltered.\n\n\"Go on,\" repeated the Colonel.  \"There's a great deal more.\"\n\n\"Look at the editorials,\" suggested Norbert. \"There's one on the same\nsubject.\"\n\nMrs. Flitcroft, her theory of the Tocsin's sarcasm somewhat shaken,\nturned the page.  \"We Confess a Mistake\" was the rubric above the\nleader, and she uttered a cry of triumph, for she thought the mistake\nwas what she had just been reading, and that the editorial would\napologize for the incomprehensible journalistic error upon the first\npage. \"'The best of us make mistakes, and it is well to have a change\nof heart sometimes.'\"  (Thus Eugene's successor had written, and so\nMrs. Flitcroft read.)  \"'An open confession is good for the soul.  The\nTocsin has changed its mind in regard to certain matters, and means to\nsay so freely and frankly.  After yesterday's events in connection with\nthe murder trial before our public, the evidence being now all\npresented, for we understand that neither side has more to offer, it is\ngenerally conceded that all good citizens are hopeful of a verdict of\nacquittal; and the Tocsin is a good citizen.  No good citizen would\nwillingly see an innocent man punished, and that our city is not to be\ndisgraced by such a miscarriage of justice is due to the efforts of the\nattorney for the defendant, who has gained credit not only by his\nmasterly management of this case, but by his splendid conduct in the\nface of danger yesterday afternoon. He has distinguished himself so\ngreatly that we frankly assert that our citizens may point with pride\nto--'\" Mrs. Flitcroft's voice, at the beginning pitched to a high\nexultation, had gradually lowered in key and dropped down the scale\ntill it disappeared altogether.\n\n\"It's a wonder to me,\" the Colonel began, \"that the Tocsin doesn't go\nand hold Joe Louden's hand.\"\n\n\"I'll read the rest of it for you,\" said Norbert, his heavy face\nlighting up with cruelty.  \"Let's see--where were you?  Oh yes--'point\nwith pride'?  'Our citizens may point with pride to ...'\"\n\nLet us not linger to observe the unmanly behavior of an aged man and\nhis grandson left alone at the breakfast-table by a defenceless woman.\n\nThe Tocsin's right-about-face undermined others besides Mrs. Flitcroft\nthat morning, and rejoiced greater (though not better) men than the\nColonel. Mr. Farbach and his lieutenants smiled, yet stared, amazed,\nwondering what had happened.  That was a thing which only three people\neven certainly knew; yet it was very simple.\n\nThe Tocsin was part of the Judge's restitution.\n\n\"The controlling interest in the paper, together with the other\nproperty I have listed,\" Joe had said, studying his memoranda under the\nlamp in Roger's old studio, while Martin Pike listened with his head in\nhis hands, \"make up what Miss Tabor is willing to accept.  As I\nestimate it, their total value is between a third and a half of that of\nthe stock which belonged to her.\"\n\n\"But this boy--this Flitcroft,\" said Pike, feebly; \"he might--\"\n\n\"He will do nothing,\" interrupted Joe.  \"The case is 'settled out of\ncourt,' and even if he were disposed to harass you, he could hardly\nhope to succeed, since Miss Tabor declines either to sue or to\nprosecute.\"\n\nThe Judge winced at the last word.  \"Yes--yes, I know; but he might--he\nmight--tell.\"\n\n\"I think Miss Tabor's influence will prevent. If it should not--well,\nyou're not in a desperate case by any means; you're involved, but far\nfrom stripped; in time you may be as sound as ever. And if Norbert\ntells, there's nothing for you to do but to live it down.\"  A faint\nsmile played upon Joe's lips as he lifted his head and looked at the\nother.  \"It can be done, I think.\"\n\nIt was then that Ariel, complaining of the warmth of the evening,\nthought it possible that Joe might find her fan upon the porch, and as\nhe departed, whispered hurriedly:  \"Judge Pike, I'm not technically in\ncontrol of the Tocsin, but haven't I the right to control its policy?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he muttered.  \"You mean about Louden--about this\ntrial--\"\n\n\"That is why I have taken the paper.\"\n\n\"You want all that changed, you mean?\"\n\nShe nodded decisively.  \"From this instant. Before morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I'll go down there and give the word.\" He rubbed his eyes\nwearily with big thumbs. \"I'm through fighting.  I'm done.  Besides,\nwhat's the use?  There's nothing more to fight.\"\n\n\"Now, Judge,\" Joe said, as he came in briskly, \"we'll go over the list\nof that unencumbered property, if you will.\"\n\nThis unencumbered property consisted of Beaver Beach and those other\nbelongings of the Judge which he had not dared to mortgage.  Joe had\nsomehow explained their nature to Ariel, and these with the Tocsin she\nhad elected to accept in restitution.\n\n\"You told me once that I ought to look after my own property, and now I\nwill.  Don't you see?\" she cried to Joe, eagerly.  \"It's my work!\"  She\nresolutely set aside every other proposition; and this was the quality\nof mercy which Martin Pike found that night.\n\n\nThere was a great crowd to hear Joe's summing-up at the trial, and\nthose who succeeded in getting into the court-room declared that it was\nworth the struggle.  He did not orate, he did not \"thunder at the\njury,\" nor did he slyly flatter them; he did not overdo the\nconfidential, nor seem so secure of understanding beforehand what their\nverdict would be that they felt an instinctive desire to fool him.  He\ntalked colloquially but clearly, without appeal to the pathetic and\nwithout garnitures, not mentioning sunsets, birds, oceans, homes, the\nglorious old State, or the happiness of liberty; but he made everybody\nin the room quite sure that Happy Fear had fired the shot which killed\nCory to save his own life.  And that, as Mr. Bradbury remarked to the\nColonel, was \"what Joe was THERE for!\"\n\nAriel's escort was increased to four that day: Mr. Ladew sat beside\nher, and there were times when Joe kept his mind entirely to the work\nin hand only by an effort, but he always succeeded. The sight of the\npale and worshipping face of Happy Fear from the corner of his eye was\nenough to insure that.  And people who could not get near the doors,\nasking those who could, \"What's he doin' now?\" were answered by\nvariations of the one formula, \"Oh, jest walkin' away with it!\"\n\nOnce the court-room was disturbed and set in an uproar which even the\nJudge's customary threat failed to subdue.  Joe had been talking very\nrapidly, and having turned the point he was making with perfect\ndexterity, the jury listening eagerly, stopped for a moment to take a\nswallow of water.  A voice rose over the low hum of the crowd in a\ndelirious chuckle:  \"Why don't somebody 'HEAD HIM OFF!'\"  The room\ninstantly rocked with laughter, under cover of which the identity of\nthe sacrilegious chuckler was not discovered, but the voice was the\nvoice of Buckalew, who was incredibly surprised to find that he had\nspoken aloud.\n\nThe jury were \"out,\" after the case had been given to them, seventeen\nminutes and thirty seconds by the watch Claudine held in her hand.  The\nlittle man, whose fate was now on the knees of the gods, looked\npathetically at the foreman and then at the face of his lawyer and\nbegan to shake violently, but not with fright.  He had gone to the jail\non Joe's word, as a good dog goes where his master bids, trustfully;\nand yet Happy had not been able to keep his mind from considering the\nhorrible chances.  \"Don't worry,\" Joe had said.  \"It's all right.  I'll\nsee you through.\" And he had kept his word.\n\nThe little man was cleared.\n\nIt took Happy a long time to get through what he had to say to his\nattorney in the anteroom, and even then, of course, he did not manage\nto put it in words, for he had \"broken down\" with sheer gratitude.\n\"Why, damn ME, Joe,\" he sobbed, \"if ever I--if ever you--well, by God!\nif you ever--\"  This was the substance of his lingual accomplishment\nunder the circumstances.  But Claudine threw her arms around poor Joe's\nneck and kissed him.\n\nMany people were waiting to shake hands with Joe and congratulate him.\nThe trio, taking advantage of seats near the rail, had already done\nthat (somewhat uproariously) before he had followed Happy, and so had\nAriel and Ladew, both, necessarily, rather hurriedly.  But in the\ncorridors he found, when he came out of the anteroom, clients,\nacquaintances, friends: old friends, new friends, and friends he had\nnever seen before--everybody beaming upon him and wringing his hand, as\nif they had been sure of it all from the start.\n\n\"KNOW him?\" said one to another.  \"Why, I've knowed him sence he was\nthat high!  SMART little feller he was, too!\"  This was a total\nstranger.\n\n\"I said, years ago\"--thus Mr. Brown, the \"National House\" clerk,\nproving his prophetic vision--\"that he'd turn out to be a big man some\nday.\"\n\nThey gathered round him if he stopped for an instant, and crowded after\nhim admiringly when he went on again, making his progress slow.  When\nhe finally came out of the big doors into the sunshine, there were as\nmany people in the yard as there had been when he stood in the same\nplace and watched the mob rushing his client's guards. But to-day their\ntemper was different, and as he paused a moment, looking down on the\nupturned, laughing faces, with a hundred jocular and congratulatory\nsalutations shouted up at him, somebody started a cheer, and it was\ntaken up with thunderous good-will.\n\nThere followed the interrogation customary in such emergencies, and the\nanxious inquirer was informed by four or five hundred people\nsimultaneously that Joe Louden was all right.\n\n\"HEAD HIM OFF!\" bellowed Mike Sheehan, suddenly darting up the steps.\nThe shout increased, and with good reason, for he stepped quickly back\nwithin the doors; and, retreating through the building, made good his\nescape by a basement door.\n\nHe struck off into a long detour, but though he managed to evade the\ncrowd, he had to stop and shake hands with every third person he met.\nAs he came out upon Main Street again, he encountered his father.\n\n\"Howdy do, Joe?\" said this laconic person, and offered his hand.  They\nshook, briefly.  \"Well,\" he continued, rubbing his beard, \"how are ye?\"\n\n\"All right, father, I think.\"\n\n\"Satisfied with the verdict?\"\n\n\"I'd be pretty hard to please if I weren't,\" Joe laughed.\n\nMr. Louden rubbed his beard again.  \"I was there,\" he said, without\nemotion.\n\n\"At the trial, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  He offered his hand once more, and again they shook.  \"Well,\ncome around and see us,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you.  I will.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Louden, \"good-day, Joe.\"\n\n\"Good-day, father.\"\n\n\nThe young man stood looking after him with a curious smile.  Then he\ngave a slight start.  Far up the street he saw two figures, one a\nlady's, in white, with a wide white hat; the other a man's, wearing\nrecognizably clerical black.  They seemed to be walking very slowly.\n\nIt had been a day of triumph for Joe; but in all his life he never\nslept worse than he did that night.\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nANCIENT OF DAYS\n\nHe woke to the chiming of bells, and, as his eyes slowly opened, the\nsorrowful people of a dream, who seemed to be bending over him,\nweeping, swam back into the darkness of the night whence they had come,\nand returned to the imperceptible, leaving their shadows in his heart.\nSlowly he rose, stumbled into the outer room, and released the\nfluttering shade; but the sunshine, springing like a golden lover\nthrough the open window, only dazzled him, and found no answering\ngladness to greet it, nor joy in the royal day it heralded.\n\nAnd yet, to the newly cleaned boys on their way to midsummer morning\nSunday-school, the breath of that cool August day was as sweet as\nstolen apples.  No doubt the stir of far, green thickets and the\ntwinkle of silver-slippered creeks shimmered in the longing vision of\ntheir minds' eyes; even so, they were merry.  But Joseph Louden,\nsighing as he descended his narrow stairs, with the bitterness still\nupon his lips of the frightful coffee he had made, heard the echo of\ntheir laughter with wonder.\n\nIt would be an hour at least before time to start to church, when Ariel\nexpected him; he stared absently up the street, then down, and, after\nthat, began slowly to walk in the latter direction, with no very active\nconsciousness, or care, of where he went.  He had fallen into a\nprofound reverie, so deep that when he had crossed the bridge and\nturned into a dusty road which ran along the river-bank, he stopped\nmechanically beside the trunk of a fallen sycamore, and, lifting his\nhead, for the first time since he had set out, looked about him with a\nmelancholy perplexity, a little surprised to find himself there.\n\nFor this was the spot where he had first seen the new Ariel, and on\nthat fallen sycamore they had sat together.  \"REMEMBER, ACROSS MAIN\nSTREET BRIDGE AT NOON!\"  And Joe's cheeks burned, as he recalled why he\nhad not understood the clear voice that had haunted him.  But that\nshame had fallen from him; she had changed all that, as she had changed\nso many things.  He sank down in the long grass, with his back against\nthe log, and stared out over the fields of tall corn, shaking in a\nsteady wind all the way to the horizon.\n\n\"Changed so many things?\" he said, half aloud. \"Everything!\"  Ah, yes,\nshe had changed the whole world for Joseph Louden--at his first sight\nof her!  And now it seemed to him that he was to lose her, but not in\nthe way he had thought.\n\nAlmost from the very first, he had the feeling that nothing so\nbeautiful as that she should stay in Canaan could happen to him.  He\nwas sure that she was but for the little while, that her coming was\nlike the flying petals of which he had told her.\n\nHe had lain upon the earth; and she had lifted him up.  For a moment he\nhad felt the beatific wings enfolding him with gentle protection, and\nthen saw them lifted to bear the angel beyond his sight.  For it was\nincredible that the gods so loved Joe Louden that they would make\ngreater gifts to him than this little time with her which they had\ngranted him.\n\n\"Changed so many things?\"\n\nThe bars that had been between him and half of his world were down,\nshattered, never more to be replaced; and the ban of Canaan was lifted.\nCould this have been, save for her?  And upon that thought he got to\nhis feet, uttering an exclamation of bitter self-reproach, asking\nhimself angrily what he was doing.  He knew how much she gave him, what\nfull measure of her affection! Was not that enough?--Out upon you,\nLouden! Are you to sulk in your tent, dour in the gloom, or to play a\nman's part, and if she be happy, turn a cheery face upon her joy?\n\nAnd thus this pilgrim recrossed the bridge, emerging to the street with\nhis head up, smiling, and his shoulders thrown back so that none might\nsee the burden he carried.\n\n\nAriel was waiting on the porch for him.  She wore the same dress she\nhad worn that Sunday of their tryst; that exquisite dress, with the\nfaint lavender overtint, like the tender colors of the beautiful day he\nmade his own.  She had not worn it since, and he was far distant when\nhe caught the first flickering glimpse of her through the lower\nbranches of the maples, but he remembered.... And again, as on that\nday, he heard a far-away, ineffable music, the Elf-land horns, sounding\nthe mysterious reveille which had wakened his soul to her coming.\n\nShe came to the gate to meet him, and gave him her hand in greeting,\nwithout a word--or the need of one--from either.  Then together they\nset forth over the sun-flecked pavement, the maples swishing above\nthem, heavier branches crooning in the strong breeze, under a sky like\na Della Robbia background.  And up against the glorious blue of it,\nsome laughing, invisible god was blowing small, rounded clouds of pure\ncotton, as children blow thistledown.\n\nWhen he opened her parasol, as they came out into the broad sunshine\nbeyond Upper Main Street, there was the faintest mingling of wild roses\nand cinnamon loosed on the air.\n\n\"Joe,\" she said, \"I'm very happy!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" he returned, heartily.  \"I think you always will be.\"\n\n\"But, oh! I wish,\" she went on, \"that Mr. Arp could have lived to see\nyou come down the Court-house steps.\"\n\n\"God bless him!\" said Joe.  \"I can hear the 'argument'!\"\n\n\"Those dear old men have been so loyal to you, Joe.\"\n\n\"No,\" he returned; \"loyal to Eskew.\"\n\n\"To you both,\" she said.  \"I'm afraid the old circle is broken up; they\nhaven't met on the National House corner since he died.  The Colonel\ntold me he couldn't bear to go there again.\"\n\n\"I don't believe any of them ever will,\" he returned.  \"And yet I never\npass the place that I don't see Eskew in his old chair.  I went there\nlast night to commune with him.  I couldn't sleep, and I got up, and\nwent over there; they'd left the chairs out; the town was asleep, and\nit was beautiful moonlight--\"\n\n\"To commune with him?  What about?\"\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, plainly mystified.\n\n\"I stood in need of good counsel,\" he answered, cheerfully, \"or a\nfriendly word, perhaps, and--as I sat there--after a while it came.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"To forget that I was sodden with selfishness; to pretend not to be as\nfull of meanness as I really was!  Doesn't that seem to be Eskew's own\nvoice?\"\n\n\"Weren't you happy last night, Joe?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was all right,\" he said, quickly.  \"Don't you worry.\"\n\nAnd at this old speech of his she broke into a little laugh of which he\nhad no comprehension.\n\n\"Mamie came to see me early this morning,\" she said, after they had\nwalked on in silence for a time.  \"Everything is all right with her\nagain; that is, I think it will be.  Eugene is coming home. And,\" she\nadded, thoughtfully, \"it will be best for him to have his old place on\nthe Tocsin again. She showed me his letter, and I liked it.  I think\nhe's been through the fire--\"\n\nJoe's distorted smile appeared.  \"And has come out gold?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" she laughed; \"but nearer it!  And I think he'll try to be more\nworth her caring for. She has always thought that his leaving the\nTocsin in the way he did was heroic.  That was her word for it.  And it\nWAS the finest thing he ever did.\"\n\n\"I can't figure Eugene out.\"  Joe shook his head.  \"There's something\nbehind his going away that I don't understand.\"  This was altogether\nthe truth; nor was there ever to come a time when either he or Mamie\nwould understand what things had determined the departure of Eugene\nBantry; though Mamie never questioned, as Joe did, the reasons for it,\nor doubted those Eugene had given her, which were the same he had given\nher father. For she was content with his return.\n\n\nAgain the bells across the Square rang out their chime.  The paths were\ndecorously enlivened with family and neighborhood groups, bound\nchurchward; and the rumble of the organ, playing the people into their\npews, shook on the air.  And Joe knew that he must speak quickly, if he\nwas to say what he had planned to say, before he and Ariel went into\nthe church.\n\n\"Ariel?\"  He tried to compel his voice to a casual cheerfulness, but it\nwould do nothing for him, except betray a desperate embarrassment.\n\nShe looked at him quickly, and as quickly away.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I wanted to say something to you, and I'd better do it now, I\nthink--before I go to church for the first time in two years!\"  He\nmanaged to laugh, though with some ruefulness, and continued\nstammeringly:  \"I want to tell you how much I like him--how much I\nadmire him--\"\n\n\"Admire whom?\" she asked, a little coldly, for she knew.\n\n\"Mr. Ladew.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" she answered, looking straight ahead. \"That is one reason\nwhy I wanted you to come with me to-day.\"\n\n\"It isn't only that.  I want to tell you--to tell you--\"  He broke off\nfor a second.  \"You remember that night in my office before Fear came\nin?\"\n\n\"Yes; I remember.\"\n\n\"And that I--that something I said troubled you because it--it sounded\nas if I cared too much for you--\"\n\n\"No; not too much.\"  She still looked straight ahead.  They were\nwalking very slowly.  \"You didn't understand.  You'd been in my mind,\nyou see, all those years, so much more than I in yours. I hadn't\nforgotten YOU.  But to you I was really a stranger--\"\n\n\"No, no!\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, I was,\" she said, gently but very quickly. \"And I--I didn't want\nyou to fall in love with me at first sight.  And yet--perhaps I did!\nBut I hadn't thought of things in that way.  I had just the same\nfeeling for you that I always had--always! I had never cared so much\nfor any one else, and it seemed to me the most necessary thing in my\nlife to come back to that old companionship--  Don't you remember--it\nused to trouble you so when I would take your hand?  I think I loved\nyour being a little rough with me.  And once, when I saw how you had\nbeen hurt, that day you ran away--\"\n\n\"Ariel!\" he gasped, helplessly.\n\n\"Have you forgotten?\"\n\nHe gathered himself together with all his will. \"I want to prove to\nyou,\" he said, resolutely, \"that the dear kindness of you isn't thrown\naway on me; I want you to know what I began to say: that it's all right\nwith me; and I think Ladew--\" He stopped again.  \"Ah!  I've seen how\nmuch he cares for you--\"\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Ariel,\" he said, \"that isn't fair to me, if you trust me.  You could\nnot have helped seeing--\"\n\n\"But I have not seen it,\" she interrupted, with great calmness.  After\nhaving said this, she finished truthfully:  \"If he did, I would never\nlet him tell me.  I like him too much.\"\n\n\"You mean you're not going to--\"\n\nSuddenly she turned to him.  \"NO!\" she said, with a depth of anger he\nhad not heard in her voice since that long-ago winter day when she\nstruck Eugene Bantry with her clenched fist. She swept over him a\nblinding look of reproach. \"How could I?\"\n\nAnd there, upon the steps of the church, in the sudden, dazzling vision\nof her love, fell the burden of him who had made his sorrowful\npilgrimage across Main Street bridge that morning.\n\n\nA manifold rustling followed them as they went down the aisle, and the\nsibilance of many whisperings; but Joe was not conscious of that, as he\ntook his place in Ariel's pew beside her.  For him there was only the\npresence of divinity; the church was filled with it.\n\n\nThey rose to sing:\n\n   \"Ancient of days, Who sittest, throned in glory,\n      To Thee all knees are bent, all voices pray;\n   Thy love has blest the wide world's wondrous story\n      With light and life since Eden's dawning day.\"\n\n\nAnd then, as they knelt to pray, there were the white heads of the\nthree old friends of Eskew Arp; and beyond was the silver hair of\nMartin Pike, who knelt beside his daughter.  Joe felt that people\nshould be very kind to the Judge.\n\n\nThe sun, so eager without, came temperately through the windows, where\nstood angels and saints in gentle colors, and the face of the young\nminister in this quiet light was like the faces in the windows....\n\n\"Not only to confront your enemies,\" he said; \"that is not enough; nor\nis it that I would have you bluster at them, nor take arms against\nthem; you will not have to do that if, when they come at you, you do\nnot turn one inch aside, but with an assured heart, with good nature,\nnot noisily, and with steadfastness, you keep on your way.  If you can\ndo that, I say that they will turn aside for you, and you shall walk\nstraight through them, and only laughter be left of their anger!\"\n\nThere was a stir among the people, and many faces turned toward Joe.\nTwo years ago he had sat in the same church, when his character and\nactions had furnished the underlying theme of a sermon, and he had\nrecognized himself without difficulty: to-day he had not the shadow of\na dream that the same thing was happening.  He thought the people were\nturning to look at Ariel, and he was very far from wondering at that.\n\nShe saw that he did not understand; she was glad to have it so.  She\nhad taken off her gloves, and he was holding them lightly and\nreverently in his hands, looking down upon them, his thin cheeks a\nlittle flushed.  And at that, and not knowing the glory that was in his\nsoul, something forlorn in his careful tenderness toward her gloves so\ntouched her that she felt the tears coming to her eyes with a sudden\nrush.  And to prevent them.\n\n\"Not the empty gloves, Joe,\" she whispered."
