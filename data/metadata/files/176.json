Rowland\n\nMallet had made his arrangements to sail for Europe on the first\nof September, and having in the interval a fortnight to spare, he\ndetermined to spend it with his cousin Cecilia, the widow of a nephew of\nhis father. He was urged by the reflection that an affectionate farewell\nmight help to exonerate him from the charge of neglect frequently\npreferred by this lady. It was not that the young man disliked her; on\nthe contrary, he regarded her with a tender admiration, and he had not\nforgotten how, when his cousin had brought her home on her marriage, he\nhad seemed to feel the upward sweep of the empty bough from which the\ngolden fruit had been plucked, and had then and there accepted the\nprospect of bachelorhood. The truth was, that, as it will be part of\nthe entertainment of this narrative to exhibit, Rowland Mallet had an\nuncomfortably sensitive conscience, and that, in spite of the seeming\nparadox, his visits to Cecilia were rare because she and her misfortunes\nwere often uppermost in it. Her misfortunes were three in number: first,\nshe had lost her husband; second, she had lost her money (or the\ngreater part of it); and third, she lived at Northampton, Massachusetts.\nMallet’s compassion was really wasted, because Cecilia was a very clever\nwoman, and a most skillful counter-plotter to adversity. She had made\nherself a charming home, her economies were not obtrusive, and there\nwas always a cheerful flutter in the folds of her crape. It was the\nconsciousness of all this that puzzled Mallet whenever he felt tempted\nto put in his oar. He had money and he had time, but he never could\ndecide just how to place these gifts gracefully at Cecilia’s service.\nHe no longer felt like marrying her: in these eight years that fancy had\ndied a natural death. And yet her extreme cleverness seemed somehow to\nmake charity difficult and patronage impossible. He would rather chop\noff his hand than offer her a check, a piece of useful furniture, or\na black silk dress; and yet there was some sadness in seeing such a\nbright, proud woman living in such a small, dull way. Cecilia had,\nmoreover, a turn for sarcasm, and her smile, which was her pretty\nfeature, was never so pretty as when her sprightly phrase had a lurking\nscratch in it. Rowland remembered that, for him, she was all smiles, and\nsuspected, awkwardly, that he ministered not a little to her sense of\nthe irony of things. And in truth, with his means, his leisure, and his\nopportunities, what had he done? He had an unaffected suspicion of\nhis uselessness. Cecilia, meanwhile, cut out her own dresses, and was\npersonally giving her little girl the education of a princess.\n\nThis time, however, he presented himself bravely enough; for in the way\nof activity it was something definite, at least, to be going to Europe\nand to be meaning to spend the winter in Rome. Cecilia met him in the\nearly dusk at the gate of her little garden, amid a studied combination\nof floral perfumes. A rosy widow of twenty-eight, half cousin, half\nhostess, doing the honors of an odorous cottage on a midsummer evening,\nwas a phenomenon to which the young man’s imagination was able to do\nample justice. Cecilia was always gracious, but this evening she was\nalmost joyous. She was in a happy mood, and Mallet imagined there was\na private reason for it--a reason quite distinct from her pleasure in\nreceiving her honored kinsman. The next day he flattered himself he was\non the way to discover it.\n\nFor the present, after tea, as they sat on the rose-framed porch, while\nRowland held his younger cousin between his knees, and she, enjoying\nher situation, listened timorously for the stroke of bedtime, Cecilia\ninsisted on talking more about her visitor than about herself.\n\n“What is it you mean to do in Europe?” she asked, lightly, giving a\nturn to the frill of her sleeve--just such a turn as seemed to Mallet to\nbring out all the latent difficulties of the question.\n\n“Why, very much what I do here,” he answered. “No great harm.”\n\n“Is it true,” Cecilia asked, “that here you do no great harm? Is not a\nman like you doing harm when he is not doing positive good?”\n\n“Your compliment is ambiguous,” said Rowland.\n\n“No,” answered the widow, “you know what I think of you. You have a\nparticular aptitude for beneficence. You have it in the first place in\nyour character. You are a benevolent person. Ask Bessie if you don’t\nhold her more gently and comfortably than any of her other admirers.”\n\n“He holds me more comfortably than Mr. Hudson,” Bessie declared,\nroundly.\n\nRowland, not knowing Mr. Hudson, could but half appreciate the eulogy,\nand Cecilia went on to develop her idea. “Your circumstances, in\nthe second place, suggest the idea of social usefulness. You are\nintelligent, you are well-informed, and your charity, if one may call it\ncharity, would be discriminating. You are rich and unoccupied, so that\nit might be abundant. Therefore, I say, you are a person to do something\non a large scale. Bestir yourself, dear Rowland, or we may be taught to\nthink that virtue herself is setting a bad example.”\n\n“Heaven forbid,” cried Rowland, “that I should set the examples of\nvirtue! I am quite willing to follow them, however, and if I don’t\ndo something on the grand scale, it is that my genius is altogether\nimitative, and that I have not recently encountered any very striking\nmodels of grandeur. Pray, what shall I do? Found an orphan asylum, or\nbuild a dormitory for Harvard College? I am not rich enough to do either\nin an ideally handsome way, and I confess that, yet awhile, I feel\ntoo young to strike my grand coup. I am holding myself ready for\ninspiration. I am waiting till something takes my fancy irresistibly. If\ninspiration comes at forty, it will be a hundred pities to have tied up\nmy money-bag at thirty.”\n\n“Well, I give you till forty,” said Cecilia. “It ‘s only a word to\nthe wise, a notification that you are expected not to run your course\nwithout having done something handsome for your fellow-men.”\n\nNine o’clock sounded, and Bessie, with each stroke, courted a closer\nembrace. But a single winged word from her mother overleaped her\nsuccessive intrenchments. She turned and kissed her cousin, and\ndeposited an irrepressible tear on his moustache. Then she went and\nsaid her prayers to her mother: it was evident she was being admirably\nbrought up. Rowland, with the permission of his hostess, lighted a cigar\nand puffed it awhile in silence. Cecilia’s interest in his career seemed\nvery agreeable. That Mallet was without vanity I by no means intend to\naffirm; but there had been times when, seeing him accept, hardly less\ndeferentially, advice even more peremptory than the widow’s, you\nmight have asked yourself what had become of his vanity. Now, in the\nsweet-smelling starlight, he felt gently wooed to egotism. There was a\nproject connected with his going abroad which it was on his tongue’s end\nto communicate. It had no relation to hospitals or dormitories, and yet\nit would have sounded very generous. But it was not because it would\nhave sounded generous that poor Mallet at last puffed it away in\nthe fumes of his cigar. Useful though it might be, it expressed most\nimperfectly the young man’s own personal conception of usefulness. He\nwas extremely fond of all the arts, and he had an almost passionate\nenjoyment of pictures. He had seen many, and he judged them sagaciously.\nIt had occurred to him some time before that it would be the work of a\ngood citizen to go abroad and with all expedition and secrecy purchase\ncertain valuable specimens of the Dutch and Italian schools as to which\nhe had received private proposals, and then present his treasures out of\nhand to an American city, not unknown to aesthetic fame, in which at\nthat time there prevailed a good deal of fruitless aspiration toward an\nart-museum. He had seen himself in imagination, more than once, in\nsome mouldy old saloon of a Florentine palace, turning toward the deep\nembrasure of the window some scarcely-faded Ghirlandaio or Botticelli,\nwhile a host in reduced circumstances pointed out the lovely drawing\nof a hand. But he imparted none of these visions to Cecilia, and he\nsuddenly swept them away with the declaration that he was of course an\nidle, useless creature, and that he would probably be even more so in\nEurope than at home. “The only thing is,” he said, “that there I shall\nseem to be doing something. I shall be better entertained, and shall be\ntherefore, I suppose, in a better humor with life. You may say that that\nis just the humor a useless man should keep out of. He should cultivate\ndiscontentment. I did a good many things when I was in Europe before,\nbut I did not spend a winter in Rome. Every one assures me that this is\na peculiar refinement of bliss; most people talk about Rome in the same\nway. It is evidently only a sort of idealized form of loafing: a passive\nlife in Rome, thanks to the number and the quality of one’s impressions,\ntakes on a very respectable likeness to activity. It is still\nlotus-eating, only you sit down at table, and the lotuses are served up\non rococo china. It ‘s all very well, but I have a distinct prevision of\nthis--that if Roman life does n’t do something substantial to make you\nhappier, it increases tenfold your liability to moral misery. It seems\nto me a rash thing for a sensitive soul deliberately to cultivate its\nsensibilities by rambling too often among the ruins of the Palatine, or\nriding too often in the shadow of the aqueducts. In such recreations the\nchords of feeling grow tense, and after-life, to spare your intellectual\nnerves, must play upon them with a touch as dainty as the tread of\nMignon when she danced her egg-dance.”\n\n“I should have said, my dear Rowland,” said Cecilia, with a laugh, “that\nyour nerves were tough, that your eggs were hard!”\n\n“That being stupid, you mean, I might be happy? Upon my word I am not.\nI am clever enough to want more than I ‘ve got. I am tired of myself, my\nown thoughts, my own affairs, my own eternal company. True happiness,\nwe are told, consists in getting out of one’s self; but the point is not\nonly to get out--you must stay out; and to stay out you must have some\nabsorbing errand. Unfortunately, I ‘ve got no errand, and nobody will\ntrust me with one. I want to care for something, or for some one. And I\nwant to care with a certain ardor; even, if you can believe it, with\na certain passion. I can’t just now feel ardent and passionate about a\nhospital or a dormitory. Do you know I sometimes think that I ‘m a man\nof genius, half finished? The genius has been left out, the faculty of\nexpression is wanting; but the need for expression remains, and I spend\nmy days groping for the latch of a closed door.”\n\n“What an immense number of words,” said Cecilia after a pause, “to say\nyou want to fall in love! I ‘ve no doubt you have as good a genius for\nthat as any one, if you would only trust it.”\n\n“Of course I ‘ve thought of that, and I assure you I hold myself ready.\nBut, evidently, I ‘m not inflammable. Is there in Northampton some\nperfect epitome of the graces?”\n\n“Of the graces?” said Cecilia, raising her eyebrows and suppressing too\ndistinct a consciousness of being herself a rosy embodiment of several.\n“The household virtues are better represented. There are some excellent\ngirls, and there are two or three very pretty ones. I will have them\nhere, one by one, to tea, if you like.”\n\n“I should particularly like it; especially as I should give you a chance\nto see, by the profundity of my attention, that if I am not happy, it ‘s\nnot for want of taking pains.”\n\nCecilia was silent a moment; and then, “On the whole,” she resumed, “I\ndon’t think there are any worth asking. There are none so very pretty,\nnone so very pleasing.”\n\n“Are you very sure?” asked the young man, rising and throwing away his\ncigar-end.\n\n“Upon my word,” cried Cecilia, “one would suppose I wished to keep\nyou for myself. Of course I am sure! But as the penalty of your\ninsinuations, I shall invite the plainest and prosiest damsel that can\nbe found, and leave you alone with her.”\n\nRowland smiled. “Even against her,” he said, “I should be sorry to\nconclude until I had given her my respectful attention.”\n\nThis little profession of ideal chivalry (which closed the conversation)\nwas not quite so fanciful on Mallet’s lips as it would have been on\nthose of many another man; as a rapid glance at his antecedents may help\nto make the reader perceive. His life had been a singular mixture of the\nrough and the smooth. He had sprung from a rigid Puritan stock, and had\nbeen brought up to think much more intently of the duties of this life\nthan of its privileges and pleasures. His progenitors had submitted in\nthe matter of dogmatic theology to the relaxing influences of recent\nyears; but if Rowland’s youthful consciousness was not chilled by the\nmenace of long punishment for brief transgression, he had at least been\nmade to feel that there ran through all things a strain of right and of\nwrong, as different, after all, in their complexions, as the texture, to\nthe spiritual sense, of Sundays and week-days. His father was a chip of\nthe primal Puritan block, a man with an icy smile and a stony frown. He\nhad always bestowed on his son, on principle, more frowns than smiles,\nand if the lad had not been turned to stone himself, it was because\nnature had blessed him, inwardly, with a well of vivifying waters. Mrs.\nMallet had been a Miss Rowland, the daughter of a retired sea-captain,\nonce famous on the ships that sailed from Salem and Newburyport. He\nhad brought to port many a cargo which crowned the edifice of fortunes\nalready almost colossal, but he had also done a little sagacious trading\non his own account, and he was able to retire, prematurely for so\nsea-worthy a maritime organism, upon a pension of his own providing. He\nwas to be seen for a year on the Salem wharves, smoking the best tobacco\nand eying the seaward horizon with an inveteracy which superficial\nminds interpreted as a sign of repentance. At last, one evening, he\ndisappeared beneath it, as he had often done before; this time,\nhowever, not as a commissioned navigator, but simply as an amateur of an\nobserving turn likely to prove oppressive to the officer in command of\nthe vessel. Five months later his place at home knew him again, and made\nthe acquaintance also of a handsome, blonde young woman, of redundant\ncontours, speaking a foreign tongue. The foreign tongue proved, after\nmuch conflicting research, to be the idiom of Amsterdam, and the young\nwoman, which was stranger still, to be Captain Rowland’s wife. Why\nhe had gone forth so suddenly across the seas to marry her, what had\nhappened between them before, and whether--though it was of questionable\npropriety for a good citizen to espouse a young person of mysterious\norigin, who did her hair in fantastically elaborate plaits, and in whose\nappearance “figure” enjoyed such striking predominance--he would\nnot have had a heavy weight on his conscience if he had remained an\nirresponsible bachelor; these questions and many others, bearing with\nvarying degrees of immediacy on the subject, were much propounded but\nscantily answered, and this history need not be charged with resolving\nthem. Mrs. Rowland, for so handsome a woman, proved a tranquil neighbor\nand an excellent housewife. Her extremely fresh complexion, however, was\nalways suffused with an air of apathetic homesickness, and she played\nher part in American society chiefly by having the little squares of\nbrick pavement in front of her dwelling scoured and polished as nearly\nas possible into the likeness of Dutch tiles. Rowland Mallet remembered\nhaving seen her, as a child--an immensely stout, white-faced lady,\nwearing a high cap of very stiff tulle, speaking English with a\nformidable accent, and suffering from dropsy. Captain Rowland was a\nlittle bronzed and wizened man, with eccentric opinions. He advocated\nthe creation of a public promenade along the sea, with arbors and little\ngreen tables for the consumption of beer, and a platform, surrounded by\nChinese lanterns, for dancing. He especially desired the town library\nto be opened on Sundays, though, as he never entered it on week-days,\nit was easy to turn the proposition into ridicule. If, therefore, Mrs.\nMallet was a woman of an exquisite moral tone, it was not that she had\ninherited her temper from an ancestry with a turn for casuistry.\nJonas Mallet, at the time of his marriage, was conducting with silent\nshrewdness a small, unpromising business. Both his shrewdness and his\nsilence increased with his years, and at the close of his life he was an\nextremely well-dressed, well-brushed gentleman, with a frigid gray eye,\nwho said little to anybody, but of whom everybody said that he had\na very handsome fortune. He was not a sentimental father, and the\nroughness I just now spoke of in Rowland’s life dated from his early\nboyhood. Mr. Mallet, whenever he looked at his son, felt extreme\ncompunction at having made a fortune. He remembered that the fruit had\nnot dropped ripe from the tree into his own mouth, and determined it\nshould be no fault of his if the boy was corrupted by luxury. Rowland,\ntherefore, except for a good deal of expensive instruction in foreign\ntongues and abstruse sciences, received the education of a poor man’s\nson. His fare was plain, his temper familiar with the discipline of\npatched trousers, and his habits marked by an exaggerated simplicity\nwhich it really cost a good deal of money to preserve unbroken. He was\nkept in the country for months together, in the midst of servants who\nhad strict injunctions to see that he suffered no serious harm, but\nwere as strictly forbidden to wait upon him. As no school could be found\nconducted on principles sufficiently rigorous, he was attended at home\nby a master who set a high price on the understanding that he was to\nillustrate the beauty of abstinence not only by precept but by example.\nRowland passed for a child of ordinary parts, and certainly, during his\nyounger years, was an excellent imitation of a boy who had inherited\nnothing whatever that was to make life easy. He was passive,\npliable, frank, extremely slow at his books, and inordinately fond of\ntrout-fishing. His hair, a memento of his Dutch ancestry, was of\nthe fairest shade of yellow, his complexion absurdly rosy, and his\nmeasurement around the waist, when he was about ten years old, quite\nalarmingly large. This, however, was but an episode in his growth; he\nbecame afterwards a fresh-colored, yellow-bearded man, but he was never\naccused of anything worse than a tendency to corpulence. He emerged from\nchildhood a simple, wholesome, round-eyed lad, with no suspicion that a\nless roundabout course might have been taken to make him happy, but with\na vague sense that his young experience was not a fair sample of human\nfreedom, and that he was to make a great many discoveries. When he was\nabout fifteen, he achieved a momentous one. He ascertained that his\nmother was a saint. She had always been a very distinct presence in his\nlife, but so ineffably gentle a one that his sense was fully opened to\nit only by the danger of losing her. She had an illness which for many\nmonths was liable at any moment to terminate fatally, and during her\nlong-arrested convalescence she removed the mask which she had worn for\nyears by her husband’s order. Rowland spent his days at her side and\nfelt before long as if he had made a new friend. All his impressions at\nthis period were commented and interpreted at leisure in the future, and\nit was only then that he understood that his mother had been for fifteen\nyears a perfectly unhappy woman. Her marriage had been an immitigable\nerror which she had spent her life in trying to look straight in the\nface. She found nothing to oppose to her husband’s will of steel but the\nappearance of absolute compliance; her spirit sank, and she lived for\na while in a sort of helpless moral torpor. But at last, as her child\nemerged from babyhood, she began to feel a certain charm in patience, to\ndiscover the uses of ingenuity, and to learn that, somehow or other, one\ncan always arrange one’s life. She cultivated from this time forward a\nlittle private plot of sentiment, and it was of this secluded precinct\nthat, before her death, she gave her son the key. Rowland’s allowance at\ncollege was barely sufficient to maintain him decently, and as soon as\nhe graduated, he was taken into his father’s counting-house, to do small\ndrudgery on a proportionate salary. For three years he earned his living\nas regularly as the obscure functionary in fustian who swept the office.\nMr. Mallet was consistent, but the perfection of his consistency was\nknown only on his death. He left but a third of his property to his\nson, and devoted the remainder to various public institutions and local\ncharities. Rowland’s third was an easy competence, and he never felt\na moment’s jealousy of his fellow-pensioners; but when one of the\nestablishments which had figured most advantageously in his father’s\nwill bethought itself to affirm the existence of a later instrument, in\nwhich it had been still more handsomely treated, the young man felt a\nsudden passionate need to repel the claim by process of law. There was a\nlively tussle, but he gained his case; immediately after which he made,\nin another quarter, a donation of the contested sum. He cared nothing\nfor the money, but he had felt an angry desire to protest against a\ndestiny which seemed determined to be exclusively salutary. It seemed to\nhim that he would bear a little spoiling. And yet he treated himself\nto a very modest quantity, and submitted without reserve to the great\nnational discipline which began in 1861. When the Civil War broke out he\nimmediately obtained a commission, and did his duty for three long years\nas a citizen soldier. His duty was obscure, but he never lost a certain\nprivate satisfaction in remembering that on two or three occasions\nit had been performed with something of an ideal precision. He had\ndisentangled himself from business, and after the war he felt a profound\ndisinclination to tie the knot again. He had no desire to make money,\nhe had money enough; and although he knew, and was frequently reminded,\nthat a young man is the better for a fixed occupation, he could discover\nno moral advantage in driving a lucrative trade. Yet few young men of\nmeans and leisure ever made less of a parade of idleness, and indeed\nidleness in any degree could hardly be laid at the door of a young\nman who took life in the serious, attentive, reasoning fashion of\nour friend. It often seemed to Mallet that he wholly lacked the prime\nrequisite of a graceful flaneur--the simple, sensuous, confident relish\nof pleasure. He had frequent fits of extreme melancholy, in which he\ndeclared that he was neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. He was\nneither an irresponsibly contemplative nature nor a sturdily practical\none, and he was forever looking in vain for the uses of the things\nthat please and the charm of the things that sustain. He was an awkward\nmixture of strong moral impulse and restless aesthetic curiosity,\nand yet he would have made a most ineffective reformer and a very\nindifferent artist. It seemed to him that the glow of happiness must be\nfound either in action, of some immensely solid kind, on behalf of\nan idea, or in producing a masterpiece in one of the arts. Oftenest,\nperhaps, he wished he were a vigorous young man of genius, without a\npenny. As it was, he could only buy pictures, and not paint them; and\nin the way of action, he had to content himself with making a rule to\nrender scrupulous moral justice to handsome examples of it in others. On\nthe whole, he had an incorruptible modesty. With his blooming complexion\nand his serene gray eye, he felt the friction of existence more than was\nsuspected; but he asked no allowance on grounds of temper, he assumed\nthat fate had treated him inordinately well and that he had no excuse\nfor taking an ill-natured view of life, and he undertook constantly to\nbelieve that all women were fair, all men were brave, and the world was\na delightful place of sojourn, until the contrary had been distinctly\nproved.\n\nCecilia’s blooming garden and shady porch had seemed so friendly to\nrepose and a cigar, that she reproached him the next morning with\nindifference to her little parlor, not less, in its way, a monument to\nher ingenious taste. “And by the way,” she added as he followed her in,\n“if I refused last night to show you a pretty girl, I can at least show\nyou a pretty boy.”\n\nShe threw open a window and pointed to a statuette which occupied the\nplace of honor among the ornaments of the room. Rowland looked at it a\nmoment and then turned to her with an exclamation of surprise. She\ngave him a rapid glance, perceived that her statuette was of altogether\nexceptional merit, and then smiled, knowingly, as if this had long been\nan agreeable certainty.\n\n“Who did it? where did you get it?” Rowland demanded.\n\n“Oh,” said Cecilia, adjusting the light, “it ‘s a little thing of Mr.\nHudson’s.”\n\n“And who the deuce is Mr. Hudson?” asked Rowland. But he was absorbed;\nhe lost her immediate reply. The statuette, in bronze, something less\nthan two feet high, represented a naked youth drinking from a gourd. The\nattitude was perfectly simple. The lad was squarely planted on his feet,\nwith his legs a little apart; his back was slightly hollowed, his head\nthrown back, and both hands raised to support the rustic cup. There was\na loosened fillet of wild flowers about his head, and his eyes, under\ntheir drooped lids, looked straight into the cup. On the base was\nscratched the Greek word Î”á¼±ÏˆÎ±, Thirst. The figure might have\nbeen some beautiful youth of ancient fable,--Hylas or Narcissus, Paris\nor Endymion. Its beauty was the beauty of natural movement; nothing had\nbeen sought to be represented but the perfection of an attitude. This\nhad been most attentively studied, and it was exquisitely rendered.\nRowland demanded more light, dropped his head on this side and that,\nuttered vague exclamations. He said to himself, as he had said more than\nonce in the Louvre and the Vatican, “We ugly mortals, what beautiful\ncreatures we are!” Nothing, in a long time, had given him so much\npleasure. “Hudson--Hudson,” he asked again; “who is Hudson?”\n\n“A young man of this place,” said Cecilia.\n\n“A young man? How old?”\n\n“I suppose he is three or four and twenty.”\n\n“Of this place, you say--of Northampton, Massachusetts?”\n\n“He lives here, but he comes from Virginia.”\n\n“Is he a sculptor by profession?”\n\n“He ‘s a law-student.”\n\nRowland burst out laughing. “He has found something in Blackstone that I\nnever did. He makes statues then simply for his pleasure?”\n\nCecilia, with a smile, gave a little toss of her head. “For mine!”\n\n“I congratulate you,” said Rowland. “I wonder whether he could be\ninduced to do anything for me?”\n\n“This was a matter of friendship. I saw the figure when he had modeled\nit in clay, and of course greatly admired it. He said nothing at the\ntime, but a week ago, on my birthday, he arrived in a buggy, with\nthis. He had had it cast at the foundry at Chicopee; I believe it ‘s a\nbeautiful piece of bronze. He begged me to accept.”\n\n“Upon my word,” said Mallet, “he does things handsomely!” And he fell to\nadmiring the statue again.\n\n“So then,” said Cecilia, “it ‘s very remarkable?”\n\n“Why, my dear cousin,” Rowland answered, “Mr. Hudson, of Virginia, is\nan extraordinary--” Then suddenly stopping: “Is he a great friend of\nyours?” he asked.\n\n“A great friend?” and Cecilia hesitated. “I regard him as a child!”\n\n“Well,” said Rowland, “he ‘s a very clever child. Tell me something\nabout him: I should like to see him.”\n\nCecilia was obliged to go to her daughter’s music-lesson, but she\nassured Rowland that she would arrange for him a meeting with the young\nsculptor. He was a frequent visitor, and as he had not called for some\ndays it was likely he would come that evening. Rowland, left alone,\nexamined the statuette at his leisure, and returned more than once\nduring the day to take another look at it. He discovered its weak\npoints, but it wore well. It had the stamp of genius. Rowland envied the\nhappy youth who, in a New England village, without aid or encouragement,\nwithout models or resources, had found it so easy to produce a lovely\nwork.\n\nIn the evening, as he was smoking his cigar on the veranda, a light,\nquick step pressed the gravel of the garden path, and in a moment a\nyoung man made his bow to Cecilia. It was rather a nod than a bow, and\nindicated either that he was an old friend, or that he was scantily\nversed in the usual social forms. Cecilia, who was sitting near the\nsteps, pointed to a neighboring chair, but the young man seated himself\nabruptly on the floor at her feet, began to fan himself vigorously with\nhis hat, and broke out into a lively objurgation upon the hot weather.\n“I ‘m dripping wet!” he said, without ceremony.\n\n“You walk too fast,” said Cecilia. “You do everything too fast.”\n\n“I know it, I know it!” he cried, passing his hand through his abundant\ndark hair and making it stand out in a picturesque shock. “I can’t\nbe slow if I try. There ‘s something inside of me that drives me. A\nrestless fiend!”\n\nCecilia gave a light laugh, and Rowland leaned forward in his hammock.\nHe had placed himself in it at Bessie’s request, and was playing that he\nwas her baby and that she was rocking him to sleep. She sat beside him,\nswinging the hammock to and fro, and singing a lullaby. When he raised\nhimself she pushed him back and said that the baby must finish its nap.\n“But I want to see the gentleman with the fiend inside of him,” said\nRowland.\n\n“What is a fiend?” Bessie demanded. “It ‘s only Mr. Hudson.”\n\n“Very well, I want to see him.”\n\n“Oh, never mind him!” said Bessie, with the brevity of contempt.\n\n“You speak as if you did n’t like him.”\n\n“I don’t!” Bessie affirmed, and put Rowland to bed again.\n\nThe hammock was swung at the end of the veranda, in the thickest shade\nof the vines, and this fragment of dialogue had passed unnoticed.\nRowland submitted a while longer to be cradled, and contented himself\nwith listening to Mr. Hudson’s voice. It was a soft and not altogether\nmasculine organ, and was pitched on this occasion in a somewhat\nplaintive and pettish key. The young man’s mood seemed fretful; he\ncomplained of the heat, of the dust, of a shoe that hurt him, of having\ngone on an errand a mile to the other side of the town and found the\nperson he was in search of had left Northampton an hour before.\n\n“Won’t you have a cup of tea?” Cecilia asked. “Perhaps that will restore\nyour equanimity.”\n\n“Aye, by keeping me awake all night!” said Hudson. “At the best, it ‘s\nhard enough to go down to the office. With my nerves set on edge by a\nsleepless night, I should perforce stay at home and be brutal to my poor\nmother.”\n\n“Your mother is well, I hope.”\n\n“Oh, she ‘s as usual.”\n\n“And Miss Garland?”\n\n“She ‘s as usual, too. Every one, everything, is as usual. Nothing ever\nhappens, in this benighted town.”\n\n“I beg your pardon; things do happen, sometimes,” said Cecilia. “Here\nis a dear cousin of mine arrived on purpose to congratulate you on your\nstatuette.” And she called to Rowland to come and be introduced to\nMr. Hudson. The young man sprang up with alacrity, and Rowland, coming\nforward to shake hands, had a good look at him in the light projected\nfrom the parlor window. Something seemed to shine out of Hudson’s face\nas a warning against a “compliment” of the idle, unpondered sort.\n\n“Your statuette seems to me very good,” Rowland said gravely. “It has\ngiven me extreme pleasure.”\n\n“And my cousin knows what is good,” said Cecilia. “He ‘s a connoisseur.”\n\nHudson smiled and stared. “A connoisseur?” he cried, laughing. “He ‘s\nthe first I ‘ve ever seen! Let me see what they look like;” and he drew\nRowland nearer to the light. “Have they all such good heads as that? I\nshould like to model yours.”\n\n“Pray do,” said Cecilia. “It will keep him a while. He is running off to\nEurope.”\n\n“Ah, to Europe!” Hudson exclaimed with a melancholy cadence, as they sat\ndown. “Happy man!”\n\nBut the note seemed to Rowland to be struck rather at random, for he\nperceived no echo of it in the boyish garrulity of his later talk.\nHudson was a tall, slender young fellow, with a singularly mobile and\nintelligent face. Rowland was struck at first only with its responsive\nvivacity, but in a short time he perceived it was remarkably handsome.\nThe features were admirably chiseled and finished, and a frank smile\nplayed over them as gracefully as a breeze among flowers. The fault of\nthe young man’s whole structure was an excessive want of breadth. The\nforehead, though it was high and rounded, was narrow; the jaw and\nthe shoulders were narrow; and the result was an air of insufficient\nphysical substance. But Mallet afterwards learned that this fair, slim\nyouth could draw indefinitely upon a mysterious fund of nervous\nforce, which outlasted and outwearied the endurance of many a sturdier\ntemperament. And certainly there was life enough in his eye to furnish\nan immortality! It was a generous dark gray eye, in which there came\nand went a sort of kindling glow, which would have made a ruder visage\nstriking, and which gave at times to Hudson’s harmonious face an\naltogether extraordinary beauty. There was to Rowland’s sympathetic\nsense a slightly pitiful disparity between the young sculptor’s delicate\ncountenance and the shabby gentility of his costume. He was dressed for\na visit--a visit to a pretty woman. He was clad from head to foot in a\nwhite linen suit, which had never been remarkable for the felicity of\nits cut, and had now quite lost that crispness which garments of this\ncomplexion can as ill spare as the back-scene of a theatre the radiance\nof the footlights. He wore a vivid blue cravat, passed through a ring\naltogether too splendid to be valuable; he pulled and twisted, as he\nsat, a pair of yellow kid gloves; he emphasized his conversation with\ngreat dashes and flourishes of a light, silver-tipped walking-stick,\nand he kept constantly taking off and putting on one of those slouched\nsombreros which are the traditional property of the Virginian or\nCarolinian of romance. When this was on, he was very picturesque, in\nspite of his mock elegance; and when it was off, and he sat nursing it\nand turning it about and not knowing what to do with it, he could hardly\nbe said to be awkward. He evidently had a natural relish for brilliant\naccessories, and appropriated what came to his hand. This was visible in\nhis talk, which abounded in the florid and sonorous. He liked words with\ncolor in them.\n\nRowland, who was but a moderate talker, sat by in silence, while\nCecilia, who had told him that she desired his opinion upon her friend,\nused a good deal of characteristic finesse in leading the young man to\nexpose himself. She perfectly succeeded, and Hudson rattled away for\nan hour with a volubility in which boyish unconsciousness and manly\nshrewdness were singularly combined. He gave his opinion on twenty\ntopics, he opened up an endless budget of local gossip, he described\nhis repulsive routine at the office of Messrs. Striker and Spooner,\ncounselors at law, and he gave with great felicity and gusto an account\nof the annual boat-race between Harvard and Yale, which he had lately\nwitnessed at Worcester. He had looked at the straining oarsmen and the\nswaying crowd with the eye of the sculptor. Rowland was a good deal\namused and not a little interested. Whenever Hudson uttered some\npeculiarly striking piece of youthful grandiloquence, Cecilia broke into\na long, light, familiar laugh.\n\n“What are you laughing at?” the young man then demanded. “Have I said\nanything so ridiculous?”\n\n“Go on, go on,” Cecilia replied. “You are too delicious! Show Mr. Mallet\nhow Mr. Striker read the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nHudson, like most men with a turn for the plastic arts, was an excellent\nmimic, and he represented with a great deal of humor the accent and\nattitude of a pompous country lawyer sustaining the burden of this\ncustomary episode of our national festival. The sonorous twang, the\nsee-saw gestures, the odd pronunciation, were vividly depicted. But\nCecilia’s manner, and the young man’s quick response, ruffled a little\npoor Rowland’s paternal conscience. He wondered whether his cousin was\nnot sacrificing the faculty of reverence in her clever protege to\nher need for amusement. Hudson made no serious rejoinder to Rowland’s\ncompliment on his statuette until he rose to go. Rowland wondered\nwhether he had forgotten it, and supposed that the oversight was a sign\nof the natural self-sufficiency of genius. But Hudson stood a moment\nbefore he said good night, twirled his sombrero, and hesitated for the\nfirst time. He gave Rowland a clear, penetrating glance, and then, with\na wonderfully frank, appealing smile: “You really meant,” he\nasked, “what you said a while ago about that thing of mine? It is\ngood--essentially good?”\n\n“I really meant it,” said Rowland, laying a kindly hand on his shoulder.\n“It is very good indeed. It is, as you say, essentially good. That is\nthe beauty of it.”\n\nHudson’s eyes glowed and expanded; he looked at Rowland for some time in\nsilence. “I have a notion you really know,” he said at last. “But if you\ndon’t, it does n’t much matter.”\n\n“My cousin asked me to-day,” said Cecilia, “whether I supposed you knew\nyourself how good it is.”\n\nHudson stared, blushing a little. “Perhaps not!” he cried.\n\n“Very likely,” said Mallet. “I read in a book the other day that\ngreat talent in action--in fact the book said genius--is a kind of\nsomnambulism. The artist performs great feats, in a dream. We must not\nwake him up, lest he should lose his balance.”\n\n“Oh, when he ‘s back in bed again!” Hudson answered with a laugh. “Yes,\ncall it a dream. It was a very happy one!”\n\n“Tell me this,” said Rowland. “Did you mean anything by your young\nWater-drinker? Does he represent an idea? Is he a symbol?”\n\nHudson raised his eyebrows and gently scratched his head. “Why, he ‘s\nyouth, you know; he ‘s innocence, he ‘s health, he ‘s strength, he ‘s\ncuriosity. Yes, he ‘s a good many things.”\n\n“And is the cup also a symbol?”\n\n“The cup is knowledge, pleasure, experience. Anything of that kind!”\n\n“Well, he ‘s guzzling in earnest,” said Rowland.\n\nHudson gave a vigorous nod. “Aye, poor fellow, he ‘s thirsty!” And on\nthis he cried good night, and bounded down the garden path.\n\n“Well, what do you make of him?” asked Cecilia, returning a short\ntime afterwards from a visit of investigation as to the sufficiency of\nBessie’s bedclothes.\n\n“I confess I like him,” said Rowland. “He ‘s very immature,--but there\n‘s stuff in him.”\n\n“He ‘s a strange being,” said Cecilia, musingly.\n\n“Who are his people? what has been his education?” Rowland asked.\n\n“He has had no education, beyond what he has picked up, with little\ntrouble, for himself. His mother is a widow, of a Massachusetts country\nfamily, a little timid, tremulous woman, who is always on pins and\nneedles about her son. She had some property herself, and married a\nVirginian gentleman of good estates. He turned out, I believe, a very\nlicentious personage, and made great havoc in their fortune. Everything,\nor almost everything, melted away, including Mr. Hudson himself. This\nis literally true, for he drank himself to death. Ten years ago his wife\nwas left a widow, with scanty means and a couple of growing boys.\nShe paid her husband’s debts as best she could, and came to establish\nherself here, where by the death of a charitable relative she had\ninherited an old-fashioned ruinous house. Roderick, our friend, was her\npride and joy, but Stephen, the elder, was her comfort and support.\nI remember him, later; he was an ugly, sturdy, practical lad, very\ndifferent from his brother, and in his way, I imagine, a very fine\nfellow. When the war broke out he found that the New England blood ran\nthicker in his veins than the Virginian, and immediately obtained\na commission. He fell in some Western battle and left his mother\ninconsolable. Roderick, however, has given her plenty to think about,\nand she has induced him, by some mysterious art, to abide, nominally at\nleast, in a profession that he abhors, and for which he is about as fit,\nI should say, as I am to drive a locomotive. He grew up a la grace de\nDieu, and was horribly spoiled. Three or four years ago he graduated at\na small college in this neighborhood, where I am afraid he had given a\ngood deal more attention to novels and billiards than to mathematics and\nGreek. Since then he has been reading law, at the rate of a page a day.\nIf he is ever admitted to practice I ‘m afraid my friendship won’t avail\nto make me give him my business. Good, bad, or indifferent, the boy is\nessentially an artist--an artist to his fingers’ ends.”\n\n“Why, then,” asked Rowland, “does n’t he deliberately take up the\nchisel?”\n\n“For several reasons. In the first place, I don’t think he more than\nhalf suspects his talent. The flame is smouldering, but it is never\nfanned by the breath of criticism. He sees nothing, hears nothing, to\nhelp him to self-knowledge. He ‘s hopelessly discontented, but he\ndoes n’t know where to look for help. Then his mother, as she one\nday confessed to me, has a holy horror of a profession which consists\nexclusively, as she supposes, in making figures of people without their\nclothes on. Sculpture, to her mind, is an insidious form of immorality,\nand for a young man of a passionate disposition she considers the law a\nmuch safer investment. Her father was a judge, she has two brothers at\nthe bar, and her elder son had made a very promising beginning in the\nsame line. She wishes the tradition to be perpetuated. I ‘m pretty sure\nthe law won’t make Roderick’s fortune, and I ‘m afraid it will, in the\nlong run, spoil his temper.”\n\n“What sort of a temper is it?”\n\n“One to be trusted, on the whole. It is quick, but it is generous. I\nhave known it to breathe flame and fury at ten o’clock in the evening,\nand soft, sweet music early on the morrow. It ‘s a very entertaining\ntemper to observe. I, fortunately, can do so dispassionately, for I ‘m\nthe only person in the place he has not quarreled with.”\n\n“Has he then no society? Who is Miss Garland, whom you asked about?”\n\n“A young girl staying with his mother, a sort of far-away cousin; a good\nplain girl, but not a person to delight a sculptor’s eye. Roderick has\na goodly share of the old Southern arrogance; he has the aristocratic\ntemperament. He will have nothing to do with the small towns-people; he\nsays they ‘re ‘ignoble.’ He cannot endure his mother’s friends--the\nold ladies and the ministers and the tea-party people; they bore him to\ndeath. So he comes and lounges here and rails at everything and every\none.”\n\nThis graceful young scoffer reappeared a couple of evenings later, and\nconfirmed the friendly feeling he had provoked on Rowland’s part. He\nwas in an easier mood than before, he chattered less extravagantly, and\nasked Rowland a number of rather naif questions about the condition of\nthe fine arts in New York and Boston. Cecilia, when he had gone, said\nthat this was the wholesome effect of Rowland’s praise of his statuette.\nRoderick was acutely sensitive, and Rowland’s tranquil commendation had\nstilled his restless pulses. He was ruminating the full-flavored verdict\nof culture. Rowland felt an irresistible kindness for him, a mingled\nsense of his personal charm and his artistic capacity. He had an\nindefinable attraction--the something divine of unspotted, exuberant,\nconfident youth. The next day was Sunday, and Rowland proposed that they\nshould take a long walk and that Roderick should show him the country.\nThe young man assented gleefully, and in the morning, as Rowland at the\ngarden gate was giving his hostess Godspeed on her way to church, he\ncame striding along the grassy margin of the road and out-whistling the\nmusic of the church bells. It was one of those lovely days of August\nwhen you feel the complete exuberance of summer just warned and checked\nby autumn. “Remember the day, and take care you rob no orchards,” said\nCecilia, as they separated.\n\nThe young men walked away at a steady pace, over hill and dale, through\nwoods and fields, and at last found themselves on a grassy elevation\nstudded with mossy rocks and red cedars. Just beneath them, in a great\nshining curve, flowed the goodly Connecticut. They flung themselves\non the grass and tossed stones into the river; they talked like old\nfriends. Rowland lit a cigar, and Roderick refused one with a grimace\nof extravagant disgust. He thought them vile things; he did n’t see how\ndecent people could tolerate them. Rowland was amused, and wondered what\nit was that made this ill-mannered speech seem perfectly inoffensive\non Roderick’s lips. He belonged to the race of mortals, to be pitied\nor envied according as we view the matter, who are not held to a strict\naccount for their aggressions. Looking at him as he lay stretched in the\nshade, Rowland vaguely likened him to some beautiful, supple, restless,\nbright-eyed animal, whose motions should have no deeper warrant than the\ntremulous delicacy of its structure, and be graceful even when they\nwere most inconvenient. Rowland watched the shadows on Mount Holyoke,\nlistened to the gurgle of the river, and sniffed the balsam of the\npines. A gentle breeze had begun to tickle their summits, and brought\nthe smell of the mown grass across from the elm-dotted river meadows. He\nsat up beside his companion and looked away at the far-spreading\nview. It seemed to him beautiful, and suddenly a strange feeling of\nprospective regret took possession of him. Something seemed to tell\nhim that later, in a foreign land, he would remember it lovingly and\npenitently.\n\n“It ‘s a wretched business,” he said, “this practical quarrel of ours\nwith our own country, this everlasting impatience to get out of it. Is\none’s only safety then in flight? This is an American day, an American\nlandscape, an American atmosphere. It certainly has its merits, and\nsome day when I am shivering with ague in classic Italy, I shall accuse\nmyself of having slighted them.”\n\nRoderick kindled with a sympathetic glow, and declared that America was\ngood enough for him, and that he had always thought it the duty of an\nhonest citizen to stand by his own country and help it along. He had\nevidently thought nothing whatever about it, and was launching his\ndoctrine on the inspiration of the moment. The doctrine expanded with\nthe occasion, and he declared that he was above all an advocate for\nAmerican art. He did n’t see why we should n’t produce the greatest\nworks in the world. We were the biggest people, and we ought to have the\nbiggest conceptions. The biggest conceptions of course would bring forth\nin time the biggest performances. We had only to be true to ourselves,\nto pitch in and not be afraid, to fling Imitation overboard and fix our\neyes upon our National Individuality. “I declare,” he cried, “there ‘s\na career for a man, and I ‘ve twenty minds to decide, on the spot, to\nembrace it--to be the consummate, typical, original, national American\nartist! It ‘s inspiring!”\n\nRowland burst out laughing and told him that he liked his practice\nbetter than his theory, and that a saner impulse than this had inspired\nhis little Water-drinker. Roderick took no offense, and three minutes\nafterwards was talking volubly of some humbler theme, but half heeded\nby his companion, who had returned to his cogitations. At last Rowland\ndelivered himself of the upshot of these. “How would you like,” he\nsuddenly demanded, “to go to Rome?”\n\nHudson stared, and, with a hungry laugh which speedily consigned our\nNational Individuality to perdition, responded that he would like it\nreasonably well. “And I should like, by the same token,” he added,\n“to go to Athens, to Constantinople, to Damascus, to the holy city of\nBenares, where there is a golden statue of Brahma twenty feet tall.”\n\n“Nay,” said Rowland soberly, “if you were to go to Rome, you should\nsettle down and work. Athens might help you, but for the present I\nshould n’t recommend Benares.”\n\n“It will be time to arrange details when I pack my trunk,” said Hudson.\n\n“If you mean to turn sculptor, the sooner you pack your trunk the\nbetter.”\n\n“Oh, but I ‘m a practical man! What is the smallest sum per annum, on\nwhich one can keep alive the sacred fire in Rome?”\n\n“What is the largest sum at your disposal?”\n\nRoderick stroked his light moustache, gave it a twist, and then\nannounced with mock pomposity: “Three hundred dollars!”\n\n“The money question could be arranged,” said Rowland. “There are ways of\nraising money.”\n\n“I should like to know a few! I never yet discovered one.”\n\n“One consists,” said Rowland, “in having a friend with a good deal more\nthan he wants, and not being too proud to accept a part of it.”\n\nRoderick stared a moment and his face flushed. “Do you mean--do you\nmean?”.... he stammered. He was greatly excited.\n\nRowland got up, blushing a little, and Roderick sprang to his feet. “In\nthree words, if you are to be a sculptor, you ought to go to Rome and\nstudy the antique. To go to Rome you need money. I ‘m fond of fine\nstatues, but unfortunately I can’t make them myself. I have to order\nthem. I order a dozen from you, to be executed at your convenience. To\nhelp you, I pay you in advance.”\n\nRoderick pushed off his hat and wiped his forehead, still gazing at his\ncompanion. “You believe in me!” he cried at last.\n\n“Allow me to explain,” said Rowland. “I believe in you, if you are\nprepared to work and to wait, and to struggle, and to exercise a great\nmany virtues. And then, I ‘m afraid to say it, lest I should disturb\nyou more than I should help you. You must decide for yourself. I simply\noffer you an opportunity.”\n\nHudson stood for some time, profoundly meditative. “You have not seen my\nother things,” he said suddenly. “Come and look at them.”\n\n“Now?”\n\n“Yes, we ‘ll walk home. We ‘ll settle the question.”\n\nHe passed his hand through Rowland’s arm and they retraced their steps.\nThey reached the town and made their way along a broad country street,\ndusky with the shade of magnificent elms. Rowland felt his companion’s\narm trembling in his own. They stopped at a large white house, flanked\nwith melancholy hemlocks, and passed through a little front garden,\npaved with moss-coated bricks and ornamented with parterres bordered\nwith high box hedges. The mansion had an air of antiquated dignity, but\nit had seen its best days, and evidently sheltered a shrunken household.\nMrs. Hudson, Rowland was sure, might be seen in the garden of a\nmorning, in a white apron and a pair of old gloves, engaged in frugal\nhorticulture. Roderick’s studio was behind, in the basement; a large,\nempty room, with the paper peeling off the walls. This represented, in\nthe fashion of fifty years ago, a series of small fantastic landscapes\nof a hideous pattern, and the young sculptor had presumably torn it away\nin great scraps, in moments of aesthetic exasperation. On a board in\na corner was a heap of clay, and on the floor, against the wall,\nstood some dozen medallions, busts, and figures, in various stages of\ncompletion. To exhibit them Roderick had to place them one by one on\nthe end of a long packing-box, which served as a pedestal. He did so\nsilently, making no explanations, and looking at them himself with a\nstrange air of quickened curiosity. Most of the things were portraits;\nand the three at which he looked longest were finished busts. One was a\ncolossal head of a negro, tossed back, defiant, with distended nostrils;\none was the portrait of a young man whom Rowland immediately perceived,\nby the resemblance, to be his deceased brother; the last represented a\ngentleman with a pointed nose, a long, shaved upper lip, and a tuft on\nthe end of his chin. This was a face peculiarly unadapted to sculpture;\nbut as a piece of modeling it was the best, and it was admirable. It\nreminded Rowland in its homely veracity, its artless artfulness, of\nthe works of the early Italian Renaissance. On the pedestal was cut\nthe name--Barnaby Striker, Esq. Rowland remembered that this was the\nappellation of the legal luminary from whom his companion had undertaken\nto borrow a reflected ray, and although in the bust there was naught\nflagrantly set down in malice, it betrayed, comically to one who could\nrelish the secret, that the features of the original had often been\nscanned with an irritated eye. Besides these there were several rough\nstudies of the nude, and two or three figures of a fanciful kind. The\nmost noticeable (and it had singular beauty) was a small modeled design\nfor a sepulchral monument; that, evidently, of Stephen Hudson. The young\nsoldier lay sleeping eternally, with his hand on his sword, like an old\ncrusader in a Gothic cathedral.\n\nRowland made no haste to pronounce; too much depended on his judgment.\n“Upon my word,” cried Hudson at last, “they seem to me very good.”\n\nAnd in truth, as Rowland looked, he saw they were good. They were\nyouthful, awkward, and ignorant; the effort, often, was more apparent\nthan the success. But the effort was signally powerful and intelligent;\nit seemed to Rowland that it needed only to let itself go to compass\ngreat things. Here and there, too, success, when grasped, had something\nmasterly. Rowland turned to his companion, who stood with his hands in\nhis pockets and his hair very much crumpled, looking at him askance.\nThe light of admiration was in Rowland’s eyes, and it speedily kindled a\nwonderful illumination on Hudson’s handsome brow. Rowland said at last,\ngravely, “You have only to work!”\n\n“I think I know what that means,” Roderick answered. He turned away,\nthrew himself on a rickety chair, and sat for some moments with his\nelbows on his knees and his head in his hands. “Work--work?” he said at\nlast, looking up, “ah, if I could only begin!” He glanced round the\nroom a moment and his eye encountered on the mantel-shelf the vivid\nphysiognomy of Mr. Barnaby Striker. His smile vanished, and he stared at\nit with an air of concentrated enmity. “I want to begin,” he cried, “and\nI can’t make a better beginning than this! Good-by, Mr. Striker!” He\nstrode across the room, seized a mallet that lay at hand, and before\nRowland could interfere, in the interest of art if not of morals, dealt\na merciless blow upon Mr. Striker’s skull. The bust cracked into a\ndozen pieces, which toppled with a great crash upon the floor. Rowland\nrelished neither the destruction of the image nor his companion’s look\nin working it, but as he was about to express his displeasure the door\nopened and gave passage to a young girl. She came in with a rapid step\nand startled face, as if she had been summoned by the noise. Seeing the\nheap of shattered clay and the mallet in Roderick’s hand, she gave a\ncry of horror. Her voice died away when she perceived that Rowland was a\nstranger, but she murmured reproachfully, “Why, Roderick, what have you\ndone?”\n\nRoderick gave a joyous kick to the shapeless fragments. “I ‘ve driven\nthe money-changers out of the temple!” he cried.\n\nThe traces retained shape enough to be recognized, and she gave a little\nmoan of pity. She seemed not to understand the young man’s allegory, but\nyet to feel that it pointed to some great purpose, which must be an evil\none, from being expressed in such a lawless fashion, and to perceive\nthat Rowland was in some way accountable for it. She looked at him with\na sharp, frank mistrust, and turned away through the open door. Rowland\nlooked after her with extraordinary interest.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Roderick\n\nEarly on the morrow Rowland received a visit from his new friend.\nRoderick was in a state of extreme exhilaration, tempered, however, by\na certain amount of righteous wrath. He had had a domestic struggle, but\nhe had remained master of the situation. He had shaken the dust of Mr.\nStriker’s office from his feet.\n\n“I had it out last night with my mother,” he said. “I dreaded the scene,\nfor she takes things terribly hard. She does n’t scold nor storm, and\nshe does n’t argue nor insist. She sits with her eyes full of tears\nthat never fall, and looks at me, when I displease her, as if I were\na perfect monster of depravity. And the trouble is that I was born to\ndisplease her. She does n’t trust me; she never has and she never will.\nI don’t know what I have done to set her against me, but ever since I\ncan remember I have been looked at with tears. The trouble is,” he went\non, giving a twist to his moustache, “I ‘ve been too absurdly docile.\nI ‘ve been sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside, and my dear\nmother has grown used to bullying me. I ‘ve made myself cheap! If I ‘m\nnot in my bed by eleven o’clock, the girl is sent out to explore with\na lantern. When I think of it, I fairly despise my amiability. It ‘s\nrather a hard fate, to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner! I\nshould like for six months to lead Mrs. Hudson the life some fellows\nlead their mothers!”\n\n“Allow me to believe,” said Rowland, “that you would like nothing of\nthe sort. If you have been a good boy, don’t spoil it by pretending you\ndon’t like it. You have been very happy, I suspect, in spite of your\nvirtues, and there are worse fates in the world than being loved too\nwell. I have not had the pleasure of seeing your mother, but I would lay\nyou a wager that that is the trouble. She is passionately fond of you,\nand her hopes, like all intense hopes, keep trembling into fears.”\n Rowland, as he spoke, had an instinctive vision of how such a beautiful\nyoung fellow must be loved by his female relatives.\n\nRoderick frowned, and with an impatient gesture, “I do her justice,” he\ncried. “May she never do me less!” Then after a moment’s hesitation, “I\n‘ll tell you the perfect truth,” he went on. “I have to fill a double\nplace. I have to be my brother as well as myself. It ‘s a good deal to\nask of a man, especially when he has so little talent as I for being\nwhat he is not. When we were both young together I was the curled\ndarling. I had the silver mug and the biggest piece of pudding, and I\nstayed in-doors to be kissed by the ladies while he made mud-pies in the\ngarden and was never missed, of course. Really, he was worth fifty of\nme! When he was brought home from Vicksburg with a piece of shell in\nhis skull, my poor mother began to think she had n’t loved him enough. I\nremember, as she hung round my neck sobbing, before his coffin, she told\nme that I must be to her everything that he would have been. I swore in\ntears and in perfect good faith that I would, but naturally I have\nnot kept my promise. I have been utterly different. I have been idle,\nrestless, egotistical, discontented. I have done no harm, I believe, but\nI have done no good. My brother, if he had lived, would have made\nfifty thousand dollars and put gas and water into the house. My mother,\nbrooding night and day on her bereavement, has come to fix her ideal in\noffices of that sort. Judged by that standard I ‘m nowhere!”\n\nRowland was at loss how to receive this account of his friend’s domestic\ncircumstances; it was plaintive, and yet the manner seemed to him\nover-trenchant. “You must lose no time in making a masterpiece,” he\nanswered; “then with the proceeds you can give her gas from golden\nburners.”\n\n“So I have told her; but she only half believes either in masterpiece or\nin proceeds. She can see no good in my making statues; they seem to her\na snare of the enemy. She would fain see me all my life tethered to the\nlaw, like a browsing goat to a stake. In that way I ‘m in sight. ‘It\n‘s a more regular occupation!’ that ‘s all I can get out of her. A\nmore regular damnation! Is it a fact that artists, in general, are such\nwicked men? I never had the pleasure of knowing one, so I could n’t\nconfute her with an example. She had the advantage of me, because she\nformerly knew a portrait-painter at Richmond, who did her miniature in\nblack lace mittens (you may see it on the parlor table), who used to\ndrink raw brandy and beat his wife. I promised her that, whatever I\nmight do to my wife, I would never beat my mother, and that as for\nbrandy, raw or diluted, I detested it. She sat silently crying for an\nhour, during which I expended treasures of eloquence. It ‘s a good thing\nto have to reckon up one’s intentions, and I assure you, as I pleaded my\ncause, I was most agreeably impressed with the elevated character of\nmy own. I kissed her solemnly at last, and told her that I had said\neverything and that she must make the best of it. This morning she has\ndried her eyes, but I warrant you it is n’t a cheerful house. I long to\nbe out of it!”\n\n“I ‘m extremely sorry,” said Rowland, “to have been the prime cause of\nso much suffering. I owe your mother some amends; will it be possible\nfor me to see her?”\n\n“If you ‘ll see her, it will smooth matters vastly; though to tell the\ntruth she ‘ll need all her courage to face you, for she considers you an\nagent of the foul fiend. She does n’t see why you should have come\nhere and set me by the ears: you are made to ruin ingenuous youths and\ndesolate doting mothers. I leave it to you, personally, to answer these\ncharges. You see, what she can’t forgive--what she ‘ll not really ever\nforgive--is your taking me off to Rome. Rome is an evil word, in my\nmother’s vocabulary, to be said in a whisper, as you ‘d say ‘damnation.’\nNorthampton is in the centre of the earth and Rome far away in outlying\ndusk, into which it can do no Christian any good to penetrate. And there\nwas I but yesterday a doomed habitue of that repository of every virtue,\nMr. Striker’s office!”\n\n“And does Mr. Striker know of your decision?” asked Rowland.\n\n“To a certainty! Mr. Striker, you must know, is not simply a\ngood-natured attorney, who lets me dog’s-ear his law-books. He’s a\nparticular friend and general adviser. He looks after my mother’s\nproperty and kindly consents to regard me as part of it. Our opinions\nhave always been painfully divergent, but I freely forgive him his\nzealous attempts to unscrew my head-piece and set it on hind part\nbefore. He never understood me, and it was useless to try to make him.\nWe speak a different language--we ‘re made of a different clay. I had a\nfit of rage yesterday when I smashed his bust, at the thought of all the\nbad blood he had stirred up in me; it did me good, and it ‘s all over\nnow. I don’t hate him any more; I ‘m rather sorry for him. See how you\n‘ve improved me! I must have seemed to him wilfully, wickedly stupid,\nand I ‘m sure he only tolerated me on account of his great regard for my\nmother. This morning I grasped the bull by the horns. I took an armful\nof law-books that have been gathering the dust in my room for the last\nyear and a half, and presented myself at the office. ‘Allow me to put\nthese back in their places,’ I said. ‘I shall never have need for\nthem more--never more, never more, never more!’ ‘So you ‘ve learned\neverything they contain?’ asked Striker, leering over his spectacles.\n‘Better late than never.’ ‘I ‘ve learned nothing that you can teach me,’\nI cried. ‘But I shall tax your patience no longer. I ‘m going to be a\nsculptor. I ‘m going to Rome. I won’t bid you good-by just yet; I shall\nsee you again. But I bid good-by here, with rapture, to these four\ndetested walls--to this living tomb! I did n’t know till now how I hated\nit! My compliments to Mr. Spooner, and my thanks for all you have not\nmade of me!’”\n\n“I ‘m glad to know you are to see Mr. Striker again,” Rowland answered,\ncorrecting a primary inclination to smile. “You certainly owe him a\nrespectful farewell, even if he has not understood you. I confess you\nrather puzzle me. There is another person,” he presently added, “whose\nopinion as to your new career I should like to know. What does Miss\nGarland think?”\n\nHudson looked at him keenly, with a slight blush. Then, with a conscious\nsmile, “What makes you suppose she thinks anything?” he asked.\n\n“Because, though I saw her but for a moment yesterday, she struck me as\na very intelligent person, and I am sure she has opinions.”\n\nThe smile on Roderick’s mobile face passed rapidly into a frown. “Oh,\nshe thinks what I think!” he answered.\n\nBefore the two young men separated Rowland attempted to give as\nharmonious a shape as possible to his companion’s scheme. “I have\nlaunched you, as I may say,” he said, “and I feel as if I ought to see\nyou into port. I am older than you and know the world better, and\nit seems well that we should voyage a while together. It ‘s on my\nconscience that I ought to take you to Rome, walk you through the\nVatican, and then lock you up with a heap of clay. I sail on the fifth\nof September; can you make your preparations to start with me?”\n\nRoderick assented to all this with an air of candid confidence in\nhis friend’s wisdom that outshone the virtue of pledges. “I have no\npreparations to make,” he said with a smile, raising his arms and\nletting them fall, as if to indicate his unencumbered condition. “What I\nam to take with me I carry here!” and he tapped his forehead.\n\n“Happy man!” murmured Rowland with a sigh, thinking of the light\nstowage, in his own organism, in the region indicated by Roderick, and\nof the heavy one in deposit at his banker’s, of bags and boxes.\n\nWhen his companion had left him he went in search of Cecilia. She\nwas sitting at work at a shady window, and welcomed him to a low\nchintz-covered chair. He sat some time, thoughtfully snipping tape with\nher scissors; he expected criticism and he was preparing a rejoinder. At\nlast he told her of Roderick’s decision and of his own influence in\nit. Cecilia, besides an extreme surprise, exhibited a certain fine\ndispleasure at his not having asked her advice.\n\n“What would you have said, if I had?” he demanded.\n\n“I would have said in the first place, ‘Oh for pity’s sake don’t carry\noff the person in all Northampton who amuses me most!’ I would have said\nin the second place, ‘Nonsense! the boy is doing very well. Let well\nalone!’”\n\n“That in the first five minutes. What would you have said later?”\n\n“That for a man who is generally averse to meddling, you were suddenly\nrather officious.”\n\nRowland’s countenance fell. He frowned in silence. Cecilia looked at him\naskance; gradually the spark of irritation faded from her eye.\n\n“Excuse my sharpness,” she resumed at last. “But I am literally in\ndespair at losing Roderick Hudson. His visits in the evening, for the\npast year, have kept me alive. They have given a silver tip to leaden\ndays. I don’t say he is of a more useful metal than other people, but he\nis of a different one. Of course, however, that I shall miss him sadly\nis not a reason for his not going to seek his fortune. Men must work and\nwomen must weep!”\n\n“Decidedly not!” said Rowland, with a good deal of emphasis. He had\nsuspected from the first hour of his stay that Cecilia had treated\nherself to a private social luxury; he had then discovered that she\nfound it in Hudson’s lounging visits and boyish chatter, and he had felt\nhimself wondering at last whether, judiciously viewed, her gain in the\nmatter was not the young man’s loss. It was evident that Cecilia was not\njudicious, and that her good sense, habitually rigid under the demands\nof domestic economy, indulged itself with a certain agreeable laxity on\nthis particular point. She liked her young friend just as he was; she\nhumored him, flattered him, laughed at him, caressed him--did\neverything but advise him. It was a flirtation without the benefits of\na flirtation. She was too old to let him fall in love with her, which\nmight have done him good; and her inclination was to keep him young, so\nthat the nonsense he talked might never transgress a certain line. It\nwas quite conceivable that poor Cecilia should relish a pastime; but if\none had philanthropically embraced the idea that something considerable\nmight be made of Roderick, it was impossible not to see that her\nfriendship was not what might be called tonic. So Rowland reflected, in\nthe glow of his new-born sympathy. There was a later time when he would\nhave been grateful if Hudson’s susceptibility to the relaxing influence\nof lovely women might have been limited to such inexpensive tribute as\nhe rendered the excellent Cecilia.\n\n“I only desire to remind you,” she pursued, “that you are likely to have\nyour hands full.”\n\n“I ‘ve thought of that, and I rather like the idea; liking, as I do, the\nman. I told you the other day, you know, that I longed to have something\non my hands. When it first occurred to me that I might start our\nyoung friend on the path of glory, I felt as if I had an unimpeachable\ninspiration. Then I remembered there were dangers and difficulties,\nand asked myself whether I had a right to step in between him and his\nobscurity. My sense of his really having the divine flame answered the\nquestion. He is made to do the things that humanity is the happier for!\nI can’t do such things myself, but when I see a young man of genius\nstanding helpless and hopeless for want of capital, I feel--and it ‘s\nno affectation of humility, I assure you--as if it would give at least a\nreflected usefulness to my own life to offer him his opportunity.”\n\n“In the name of humanity, I suppose, I ought to thank you. But I want,\nfirst of all, to be happy myself. You guarantee us at any rate, I hope,\nthe masterpieces.”\n\n“A masterpiece a year,” said Rowland smiling, “for the next quarter of a\ncentury.”\n\n“It seems to me that we have a right to ask more: to demand that you\nguarantee us not only the development of the artist, but the security of\nthe man.”\n\nRowland became grave again. “His security?”\n\n“His moral, his sentimental security. Here, you see, it ‘s perfect. We\nare all under a tacit compact to preserve it. Perhaps you believe in\nthe necessary turbulence of genius, and you intend to enjoin upon your\nprotege the importance of cultivating his passions.”\n\n“On the contrary, I believe that a man of genius owes as much deference\nto his passions as any other man, but not a particle more, and I confess\nI have a strong conviction that the artist is better for leading a quiet\nlife. That is what I shall preach to my protege, as you call him, by\nexample as well as by precept. You evidently believe,” he added in a\nmoment, “that he will lead me a dance.”\n\n“Nay, I prophesy nothing. I only think that circumstances, with our\nyoung man, have a great influence; as is proved by the fact that\nalthough he has been fuming and fretting here for the last five years,\nhe has nevertheless managed to make the best of it, and found it easy,\non the whole, to vegetate. Transplanted to Rome, I fancy he ‘ll put\nforth a denser leafage. I should like vastly to see the change. You must\nwrite me about it, from stage to stage. I hope with all my heart that\nthe fruit will be proportionate to the foliage. Don’t think me a bird of\nill omen; only remember that you will be held to a strict account.”\n\n“A man should make the most of himself, and be helped if he needs help,”\n Rowland answered, after a long pause. “Of course when a body begins to\nexpand, there comes in the possibility of bursting; but I nevertheless\napprove of a certain tension of one’s being. It ‘s what a man is meant\nfor. And then I believe in the essential salubrity of genius--true\ngenius.”\n\n“Very good,” said Cecilia, with an air of resignation which made\nRowland, for the moment, seem to himself culpably eager. “We ‘ll drink\nthen to-day at dinner to the health of our friend.”\n\n* * *\n\nHaving it much at heart to convince Mrs. Hudson of the purity of his\nintentions, Rowland waited upon her that evening. He was ushered into a\nlarge parlor, which, by the light of a couple of candles, he perceived\nto be very meagrely furnished and very tenderly and sparingly used. The\nwindows were open to the air of the summer night, and a circle of three\npersons was temporarily awed into silence by his appearance. One\nof these was Mrs. Hudson, who was sitting at one of the windows,\nempty-handed save for the pocket-handkerchief in her lap, which was held\nwith an air of familiarity with its sadder uses. Near her, on the sofa,\nhalf sitting, half lounging, in the attitude of a visitor outstaying\nceremony, with one long leg flung over the other and a large foot in a\nclumsy boot swinging to and fro continually, was a lean, sandy-haired\ngentleman whom Rowland recognized as the original of the portrait of Mr.\nBarnaby Striker. At the table, near the candles, busy with a substantial\npiece of needle-work, sat the young girl of whom he had had a moment’s\nquickened glimpse in Roderick’s studio, and whom he had learned to\nbe Miss Garland, his companion’s kinswoman. This young lady’s limpid,\npenetrating gaze was the most effective greeting he received. Mrs.\nHudson rose with a soft, vague sound of distress, and stood looking at\nhim shrinkingly and waveringly, as if she were sorely tempted to\nretreat through the open window. Mr. Striker swung his long leg a trifle\ndefiantly. No one, evidently, was used to offering hollow welcomes or\ntelling polite fibs. Rowland introduced himself; he had come, he might\nsay, upon business.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Hudson tremulously; “I know--my son has told me. I\nsuppose it is better I should see you. Perhaps you will take a seat.”\n\nWith this invitation Rowland prepared to comply, and, turning, grasped\nthe first chair that offered itself.\n\n“Not that one,” said a full, grave voice; whereupon he perceived that a\nquantity of sewing-silk had been suspended and entangled over the back,\npreparatory to being wound on reels. He felt the least bit irritated at\nthe curtness of the warning, coming as it did from a young woman whose\ncountenance he had mentally pronounced interesting, and with regard to\nwhom he was conscious of the germ of the inevitable desire to produce a\nresponsive interest. And then he thought it would break the ice to say\nsomething playfully urbane.\n\n“Oh, you should let me take the chair,” he answered, “and have the\npleasure of holding the skeins myself!”\n\nFor all reply to this sally he received a stare of undisguised amazement\nfrom Miss Garland, who then looked across at Mrs. Hudson with a glance\nwhich plainly said: “You see he ‘s quite the insidious personage we\nfeared.” The elder lady, however, sat with her eyes fixed on the ground\nand her two hands tightly clasped. But touching her Rowland felt much\nmore compassion than resentment; her attitude was not coldness, it was\na kind of dread, almost a terror. She was a small, eager woman, with a\npale, troubled face, which added to her apparent age. After looking at\nher for some minutes Rowland saw that she was still young, and that she\nmust have been a very girlish bride. She had been a pretty one, too,\nthough she probably had looked terribly frightened at the altar. She\nwas very delicately made, and Roderick had come honestly by his physical\nslimness and elegance. She wore no cap, and her flaxen hair, which was\nof extraordinary fineness, was smoothed and confined with Puritanic\nprecision. She was excessively shy, and evidently very humble-minded; it\nwas singular to see a woman to whom the experience of life had conveyed\nso little reassurance as to her own resources or the chances of things\nturning out well. Rowland began immediately to like her, and to feel\nimpatient to persuade her that there was no harm in him, and that,\ntwenty to one, her son would make her a well-pleased woman yet. He\nforesaw that she would be easy to persuade, and that a benevolent\nconversational tone would probably make her pass, fluttering, from\ndistrust into an oppressive extreme of confidence. But he had an\nindefinable sense that the person who was testing that strong young\neyesight of hers in the dim candle-light was less readily beguiled\nfrom her mysterious feminine preconceptions. Miss Garland, according\nto Cecilia’s judgment, as Rowland remembered, had not a countenance to\ninspire a sculptor; but it seemed to Rowland that her countenance might\nfairly inspire a man who was far from being a sculptor. She was not\npretty, as the eye of habit judges prettiness, but when you made the\nobservation you somehow failed to set it down against her, for you had\nalready passed from measuring contours to tracing meanings. In Mary\nGarland’s face there were many possible ones, and they gave you the more\nto think about that it was not--like Roderick Hudson’s, for instance--a\nquick and mobile face, over which expression flickered like a candle in\na wind. They followed each other slowly, distinctly, gravely, sincerely,\nand you might almost have fancied that, as they came and went, they gave\nher a sort of pain. She was tall and slender, and had an air of maidenly\nstrength and decision. She had a broad forehead and dark eyebrows, a\ntrifle thicker than those of classic beauties; her gray eye was clear\nbut not brilliant, and her features were perfectly irregular. Her mouth\nwas large, fortunately for the principal grace of her physiognomy was\nher smile, which displayed itself with magnificent amplitude. Rowland,\nindeed, had not yet seen her smile, but something assured him that her\nrigid gravity had a radiant counterpart. She wore a scanty white dress,\nand had a nameless rustic air which would have led one to speak of her\nless as a young lady than as a young woman. She was evidently a girl\nof a great personal force, but she lacked pliancy. She was hemming\na kitchen towel with the aid of a large steel thimble. She bent her\nserious eyes at last on her work again, and let Rowland explain himself.\n\n“I have become suddenly so very intimate with your son,” he said at\nlast, addressing himself to Mrs. Hudson, “that it seems just I should\nmake your acquaintance.”\n\n“Very just,” murmured the poor lady, and after a moment’s hesitation was\non the point of adding something more; but Mr. Striker here interposed,\nafter a prefatory clearance of the throat.\n\n“I should like to take the liberty,” he said, “of addressing you a\nsimple question. For how long a period of time have you been acquainted\nwith our young friend?” He continued to kick the air, but his head was\nthrown back and his eyes fixed on the opposite wall, as if in aversion\nto the spectacle of Rowland’s inevitable confusion.\n\n“A very short time, I confess. Hardly three days.”\n\n“And yet you call yourself intimate, eh? I have been seeing Mr. Roderick\ndaily these three years, and yet it was only this morning that I felt as\nif I had at last the right to say that I knew him. We had a few moments’\nconversation in my office which supplied the missing links in the\nevidence. So that now I do venture to say I ‘m acquainted with Mr.\nRoderick! But wait three years, sir, like me!” and Mr. Striker laughed,\nwith a closed mouth and a noiseless shake of all his long person.\n\nMrs. Hudson smiled confusedly, at hazard; Miss Garland kept her eyes on\nher stitches. But it seemed to Rowland that the latter colored a little.\n“Oh, in three years, of course,” he said, “we shall know each other\nbetter. Before many years are over, madam,” he pursued, “I expect the\nworld to know him. I expect him to be a great man!”\n\nMrs. Hudson looked at first as if this could be but an insidious device\nfor increasing her distress by the assistance of irony. Then reassured,\nlittle by little, by Rowland’s benevolent visage, she gave him an\nappealing glance and a timorous “Really?”\n\nBut before Rowland could respond, Mr. Striker again intervened. “Do\nI fully apprehend your expression?” he asked. “Our young friend is to\nbecome a great man?”\n\n“A great artist, I hope,” said Rowland.\n\n“This is a new and interesting view,” said Mr. Striker, with an\nassumption of judicial calmness. “We have had hopes for Mr. Roderick,\nbut I confess, if I have rightly understood them, they stopped short of\ngreatness. We should n’t have taken the responsibility of claiming\nit for him. What do you say, ladies? We all feel about him here--his\nmother, Miss Garland, and myself--as if his merits were rather in the\nline of the”--and Mr. Striker waved his hand with a series of fantastic\nflourishes in the air--“of the light ornamental!” Mr. Striker bore his\nrecalcitrant pupil a grudge, but he was evidently trying both to be\nfair and to respect the susceptibilities of his companions. But he was\nunversed in the mysterious processes of feminine emotion. Ten minutes\nbefore, there had been a general harmony of sombre views; but on hearing\nRoderick’s limitations thus distinctly formulated to a stranger, the two\nladies mutely protested. Mrs. Hudson uttered a short, faint sigh, and\nMiss Garland raised her eyes toward their advocate and visited him with\na short, cold glance.\n\n“I ‘m afraid, Mrs. Hudson,” Rowland pursued, evading the discussion\nof Roderick’s possible greatness, “that you don’t at all thank me for\nstirring up your son’s ambition on a line which leads him so far from\nhome. I suspect I have made you my enemy.”\n\nMrs. Hudson covered her mouth with her finger-tips and looked painfully\nperplexed between the desire to confess the truth and the fear of being\nimpolite. “My cousin is no one’s enemy,” Miss Garland hereupon declared,\ngently, but with that same fine deliberateness with which she had made\nRowland relax his grasp of the chair.\n\n“Does she leave that to you?” Rowland ventured to ask, with a smile.\n\n“We are inspired with none but Christian sentiments,” said Mr. Striker;\n“Miss Garland perhaps most of all. Miss Garland,” and Mr. Striker\nwaved his hand again as if to perform an introduction which had been\nregrettably omitted, “is the daughter of a minister, the granddaughter\nof a minister, the sister of a minister.” Rowland bowed deferentially,\nand the young girl went on with her sewing, with nothing, apparently,\neither of embarrassment or elation at the promulgation of these facts.\nMr. Striker continued: “Mrs. Hudson, I see, is too deeply agitated\nto converse with you freely. She will allow me to address you a few\nquestions. Would you kindly inform her, as exactly as possible, just\nwhat you propose to do with her son?”\n\nThe poor lady fixed her eyes appealingly on Rowland’s face and seemed\nto say that Mr. Striker had spoken her desire, though she herself would\nhave expressed it less defiantly. But Rowland saw in Mr. Striker’s\nmany-wrinkled light blue eye, shrewd at once and good-natured, that\nhe had no intention of defiance, and that he was simply pompous and\nconceited and sarcastically compassionate of any view of things in which\nRoderick Hudson was regarded in a serious light.\n\n“Do, my dear madam?” demanded Rowland. “I don’t propose to do anything.\nHe must do for himself. I simply offer him the chance. He ‘s to study,\nto work--hard, I hope.”\n\n“Not too hard, please,” murmured Mrs. Hudson, pleadingly, wheeling about\nfrom recent visions of dangerous leisure. “He ‘s not very strong, and I\n‘m afraid the climate of Europe is very relaxing.”\n\n“Ah, study?” repeated Mr. Striker. “To what line of study is he to\ndirect his attention?” Then suddenly, with an impulse of disinterested\ncuriosity on his own account, “How do you study sculpture, anyhow?”\n\n“By looking at models and imitating them.”\n\n“At models, eh? To what kind of models do you refer?”\n\n“To the antique, in the first place.”\n\n“Ah, the antique,” repeated Mr. Striker, with a jocose intonation. “Do\nyou hear, madam? Roderick is going off to Europe to learn to imitate the\nantique.”\n\n“I suppose it ‘s all right,” said Mrs. Hudson, twisting herself in a\nsort of delicate anguish.\n\n“An antique, as I understand it,” the lawyer continued, “is an image of\na pagan deity, with considerable dirt sticking to it, and no arms, no\nnose, and no clothing. A precious model, certainly!”\n\n“That ‘s a very good description of many,” said Rowland, with a laugh.\n\n“Mercy! Truly?” asked Mrs. Hudson, borrowing courage from his urbanity.\n\n“But a sculptor’s studies, you intimate, are not confined to the\nantique,” Mr. Striker resumed. “After he has been looking three or four\nyears at the objects I describe”--\n\n“He studies the living model,” said Rowland.\n\n“Does it take three or four years?” asked Mrs. Hudson, imploringly.\n\n“That depends upon the artist’s aptitude. After twenty years a real\nartist is still studying.”\n\n“Oh, my poor boy!” moaned Mrs. Hudson, finding the prospect, under every\nlight, still terrible.\n\n“Now this study of the living model,” Mr. Striker pursued. “Inform Mrs.\nHudson about that.”\n\n“Oh dear, no!” cried Mrs. Hudson, shrinkingly.\n\n“That too,” said Rowland, “is one of the reasons for studying in Rome.\nIt ‘s a handsome race, you know, and you find very well-made people.”\n\n“I suppose they ‘re no better made than a good tough Yankee,” objected\nMr. Striker, transposing his interminable legs. “The same God made us.”\n\n“Surely,” sighed Mrs. Hudson, but with a questioning glance at her\nvisitor which showed that she had already begun to concede much weight\nto his opinion. Rowland hastened to express his assent to Mr. Striker’s\nproposition.\n\nMiss Garland looked up, and, after a moment’s hesitation: “Are the Roman\nwomen very beautiful?” she asked.\n\nRowland too, in answering, hesitated; he was looking straight at the\nyoung girl. “On the whole, I prefer ours,” he said.\n\nShe had dropped her work in her lap; her hands were crossed upon it, her\nhead thrown a little back. She had evidently expected a more impersonal\nanswer, and she was dissatisfied. For an instant she seemed inclined to\nmake a rejoinder, but she slowly picked up her work in silence and drew\nher stitches again.\n\nRowland had for the second time the feeling that she judged him to be\na person of a disagreeably sophisticated tone. He noticed too that the\nkitchen towel she was hemming was terribly coarse. And yet his answer\nhad a resonant inward echo, and he repeated to himself, “Yes, on the\nwhole, I prefer ours.”\n\n“Well, these models,” began Mr. Striker. “You put them into an attitude,\nI suppose.”\n\n“An attitude, exactly.”\n\n“And then you sit down and look at them.”\n\n“You must not sit too long. You must go at your clay and try to build up\nsomething that looks like them.”\n\n“Well, there you are with your model in an attitude on one side,\nyourself, in an attitude too, I suppose, on the other, and your pile of\nclay in the middle, building up, as you say. So you pass the morning.\nAfter that I hope you go out and take a walk, and rest from your\nexertions.”\n\n“Unquestionably. But to a sculptor who loves his work there is no time\nlost. Everything he looks at teaches or suggests something.”\n\n“That ‘s a tempting doctrine to young men with a taste for sitting by\nthe hour with the page unturned, watching the flies buzz, or the frost\nmelt on the window-pane. Our young friend, in this way, must have laid\nup stores of information which I never suspected!”\n\n“Very likely,” said Rowland, with an unresentful smile, “he will prove\nsome day the completer artist for some of those lazy reveries.”\n\nThis theory was apparently very grateful to Mrs. Hudson, who had never\nhad the case put for her son with such ingenious hopefulness, and found\nherself disrelishing the singular situation of seeming to side against\nher own flesh and blood with a lawyer whose conversational tone betrayed\nthe habit of cross-questioning.\n\n“My son, then,” she ventured to ask, “my son has great--what you would\ncall great powers?”\n\n“To my sense, very great powers.”\n\nPoor Mrs. Hudson actually smiled, broadly, gleefully, and glanced at\nMiss Garland, as if to invite her to do likewise. But the young girl’s\nface remained serious, like the eastern sky when the opposite sunset is\ntoo feeble to make it glow. “Do you really know?” she asked, looking at\nRowland.\n\n“One cannot know in such a matter save after proof, and proof takes\ntime. But one can believe.”\n\n“And you believe?”\n\n“I believe.”\n\nBut even then Miss Garland vouchsafed no smile. Her face became graver\nthan ever.\n\n“Well, well,” said Mrs. Hudson, “we must hope that it is all for the\nbest.”\n\nMr. Striker eyed his old friend for a moment with a look of some\ndispleasure; he saw that this was but a cunning feminine imitation of\nresignation, and that, through some untraceable process of transition,\nshe was now taking more comfort in the opinions of this insinuating\nstranger than in his own tough dogmas. He rose to his feet,\nwithout pulling down his waistcoat, but with a wrinkled grin at the\ninconsistency of women. “Well, sir, Mr. Roderick’s powers are nothing to\nme,” he said, “nor no use he makes of them. Good or bad, he ‘s no son\nof mine. But, in a friendly way, I ‘m glad to hear so fine an account\nof him. I ‘m glad, madam, you ‘re so satisfied with the prospect.\nAffection, sir, you see, must have its guarantees!” He paused a moment,\nstroking his beard, with his head inclined and one eye half-closed,\nlooking at Rowland. The look was grotesque, but it was significant, and\nit puzzled Rowland more than it amused him. “I suppose you ‘re a very\nbrilliant young man,” he went on, “very enlightened, very cultivated,\nquite up to the mark in the fine arts and all that sort of thing. I ‘m a\nplain, practical old boy, content to follow an honorable profession in a\nfree country. I did n’t go off to the Old World to learn my business; no\none took me by the hand; I had to grease my wheels myself, and, such as\nI am, I ‘m a self-made man, every inch of me! Well, if our young friend\nis booked for fame and fortune, I don’t suppose his going to Rome will\nstop him. But, mind you, it won’t help him such a long way, either. If\nyou have undertaken to put him through, there ‘s a thing or two you ‘d\nbetter remember. The crop we gather depends upon the seed we sow. He may\nbe the biggest genius of the age: his potatoes won’t come up without his\nhoeing them. If he takes things so almighty easy as--well, as one or two\nyoung fellows of genius I ‘ve had under my eye--his produce will never\ngain the prize. Take the word for it of a man who has made his way inch\nby inch, and does n’t believe that we ‘ll wake up to find our work done\nbecause we ‘ve lain all night a-dreaming of it; anything worth doing is\ndevilish hard to do! If your young protajay finds things easy and has\na good time and says he likes the life, it ‘s a sign that--as I may\nsay--you had better step round to the office and look at the books. That\n‘s all I desire to remark. No offense intended. I hope you ‘ll have a\nfirst-rate time.”\n\nRowland could honestly reply that this seemed pregnant sense, and he\noffered Mr. Striker a friendly hand-shake as the latter withdrew. But\nMr. Striker’s rather grim view of matters cast a momentary shadow on his\ncompanions, and Mrs. Hudson seemed to feel that it necessitated between\nthem some little friendly agreement not to be overawed.\n\nRowland sat for some time longer, partly because he wished to please the\ntwo women and partly because he was strangely pleased himself. There\nwas something touching in their unworldly fears and diffident hopes,\nsomething almost terrible in the way poor little Mrs. Hudson seemed\nto flutter and quiver with intense maternal passion. She put forth one\ntimid conversational venture after another, and asked Rowland a number\nof questions about himself, his age, his family, his occupations, his\ntastes, his religious opinions. Rowland had an odd feeling at last that\nshe had begun to consider him very exemplary, and that she might\nmake, later, some perturbing discovery. He tried, therefore, to invent\nsomething that would prepare her to find him fallible. But he could\nthink of nothing. It only seemed to him that Miss Garland secretly\nmistrusted him, and that he must leave her to render him the service,\nafter he had gone, of making him the object of a little firm derogation.\nMrs. Hudson talked with low-voiced eagerness about her son.\n\n“He ‘s very lovable, sir, I assure you. When you come to know him you\n‘ll find him very lovable. He ‘s a little spoiled, of course; he has\nalways done with me as he pleased; but he ‘s a good boy, I ‘m sure he ‘s\na good boy. And every one thinks him very attractive: I ‘m sure he ‘d be\nnoticed, anywhere. Don’t you think he ‘s very handsome, sir? He features\nhis poor father. I had another--perhaps you ‘ve been told. He was\nkilled.” And the poor little lady bravely smiled, for fear of doing\nworse. “He was a very fine boy, but very different from Roderick.\nRoderick is a little strange; he has never been an easy boy. Sometimes\nI feel like the goose--was n’t it a goose, dear?” and startled by the\naudacity of her comparison she appealed to Miss Garland--“the goose, or\nthe hen, who hatched a swan’s egg. I have never been able to give him\nwhat he needs. I have always thought that in more--in more brilliant\ncircumstances he might find his place and be happy. But at the same time\nI was afraid of the world for him; it was so large and dangerous and\ndreadful. No doubt I know very little about it. I never suspected, I\nconfess, that it contained persons of such liberality as yours.”\n\nRowland replied that, evidently, she had done the world but scanty\njustice. “No,” objected Miss Garland, after a pause, “it is like\nsomething in a fairy tale.”\n\n“What, pray?”\n\n“Your coming here all unknown, so rich and so polite, and carrying off\nmy cousin in a golden cloud.”\n\nIf this was badinage Miss Garland had the best of it, for Rowland almost\nfell a-musing silently over the question whether there was a possibility\nof irony in that transparent gaze. Before he withdrew, Mrs. Hudson made\nhim tell her again that Roderick’s powers were extraordinary. He had\ninspired her with a clinging, caressing faith in his wisdom. “He will\nreally do great things,” she asked, “the very greatest?”\n\n“I see no reason in his talent itself why he should not.”\n\n“Well, we ‘ll think of that as we sit here alone,” she rejoined. “Mary\nand I will sit here and talk about it. So I give him up,” she went on,\nas he was going. “I ‘m sure you ‘ll be the best of friends to him,\nbut if you should ever forget him, or grow tired of him, or lose your\ninterest in him, and he should come to any harm or any trouble, please,\nsir, remember”--And she paused, with a tremulous voice.\n\n“Remember, my dear madam?”\n\n“That he is all I have--that he is everything--and that it would be very\nterrible.”\n\n“In so far as I can help him, he shall succeed,” was all Rowland could\nsay. He turned to Miss Garland, to bid her good night, and she rose and\nput out her hand. She was very straightforward, but he could see that if\nshe was too modest to be bold, she was much too simple to be shy. “Have\nyou no charge to lay upon me?” he asked--to ask her something.\n\nShe looked at him a moment and then, although she was not shy, she\nblushed. “Make him do his best,” she said.\n\nRowland noted the soft intensity with which the words were uttered. “Do\nyou take a great interest in him?” he demanded.\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“Then, if he will not do his best for you, he will not do it for me.”\n She turned away with another blush, and Rowland took his leave.\n\nHe walked homeward, thinking of many things. The great Northampton\nelms interarched far above in the darkness, but the moon had risen and\nthrough scattered apertures was hanging the dusky vault with silver\nlamps. There seemed to Rowland something intensely serious in the scene\nin which he had just taken part. He had laughed and talked and braved it\nout in self-defense; but when he reflected that he was really meddling\nwith the simple stillness of this little New England home, and that he\nhad ventured to disturb so much living security in the interest of a\nfar-away, fantastic hypothesis, he paused, amazed at his temerity. It\nwas true, as Cecilia had said, that for an unofficious man it was a\nsingular position. There stirred in his mind an odd feeling of annoyance\nwith Roderick for having thus peremptorily enlisted his sympathies. As\nhe looked up and down the long vista, and saw the clear white houses\nglancing here and there in the broken moonshine, he could almost have\nbelieved that the happiest lot for any man was to make the most of life\nin some such tranquil spot as that. Here were kindness, comfort, safety,\nthe warning voice of duty, the perfect hush of temptation. And as\nRowland looked along the arch of silvered shadow and out into the lucid\nair of the American night, which seemed so doubly vast, somehow, and\nstrange and nocturnal, he felt like declaring that here was beauty\ntoo--beauty sufficient for an artist not to starve upon it. As he stood,\nlost in the darkness, he presently heard a rapid tread on the other side\nof the road, accompanied by a loud, jubilant whistle, and in a moment\na figure emerged into an open gap of moonshine. He had no difficulty\nin recognizing Hudson, who was presumably returning from a visit to\nCecilia. Roderick stopped suddenly and stared up at the moon, with his\nface vividly illumined. He broke out into a snatch of song:--\n\n“The splendor falls on castle walls\nAnd snowy summits old in story!”\n\nAnd with a great, musical roll of his voice he went swinging off into\nthe darkness again, as if his thoughts had lent him wings. He was\ndreaming of the inspiration of foreign lands,--of castled crags and\nhistoric landscapes. What a pity, after all, thought Rowland, as he went\nhis own way, that he should n’t have a taste of it!\n\nIt had been a very just remark of Cecilia’s that Roderick would change\nwith a change in his circumstances. Rowland had telegraphed to New York\nfor another berth on his steamer, and from the hour the answer came\nHudson’s spirits rose to incalculable heights. He was radiant with\ngood-humor, and his kindly jollity seemed the pledge of a brilliant\nfuture. He had forgiven his old enemies and forgotten his old\ngrievances, and seemed every way reconciled to a world in which he was\ngoing to count as an active force. He was inexhaustibly loquacious and\nfantastic, and as Cecilia said, he had suddenly become so good that\nit was only to be feared he was going to start not for Europe but for\nheaven. He took long walks with Rowland, who felt more and more the\nfascination of what he would have called his giftedness. Rowland\nreturned several times to Mrs. Hudson’s, and found the two ladies doing\ntheir best to be happy in their companion’s happiness. Miss Garland, he\nthought, was succeeding better than her demeanor on his first visit had\npromised. He tried to have some especial talk with her, but her extreme\nreserve forced him to content himself with such response to his rather\nurgent overtures as might be extracted from a keenly attentive smile.\nIt must be confessed, however, that if the response was vague, the\nsatisfaction was great, and that Rowland, after his second visit, kept\nseeing a lurking reflection of this smile in the most unexpected places.\nIt seemed strange that she should please him so well at so slender\na cost, but please him she did, prodigiously, and his pleasure had\na quality altogether new to him. It made him restless, and a trifle\nmelancholy; he walked about absently, wondering and wishing. He\nwondered, among other things, why fate should have condemned him to\nmake the acquaintance of a girl whom he would make a sacrifice to know\nbetter, just as he was leaving the country for years. It seemed to him\nthat he was turning his back on a chance of happiness--happiness of a\nsort of which the slenderest germ should be cultivated. He asked himself\nwhether, feeling as he did, if he had only himself to please, he would\ngive up his journey and--wait. He had Roderick to please now, for whom\ndisappointment would be cruel; but he said to himself that certainly, if\nthere were no Roderick in the case, the ship should sail without him.\nHe asked Hudson several questions about his cousin, but Roderick,\nconfidential on most points, seemed to have reasons of his own for\nbeing reticent on this one. His measured answers quickened Rowland’s\ncuriosity, for Miss Garland, with her own irritating half-suggestions,\nhad only to be a subject of guarded allusion in others to become\nintolerably interesting. He learned from Roderick that she was the\ndaughter of a country minister, a far-away cousin of his mother,\nsettled in another part of the State; that she was one of a half-a-dozen\ndaughters, that the family was very poor, and that she had come a couple\nof months before to pay his mother a long visit. “It is to be a very\nlong one now,” he said, “for it is settled that she is to remain while I\nam away.”\n\nThe fermentation of contentment in Roderick’s soul reached its climax a\nfew days before the young men were to make their farewells. He had been\nsitting with his friends on Cecilia’s veranda, but for half an hour past\nhe had said nothing. Lounging back against a vine-wreathed column and\ngazing idly at the stars, he kept caroling softly to himself with that\nindifference to ceremony for which he always found allowance, and which\nin him had a sort of pleading grace. At last, springing up: “I want to\nstrike out, hard!” he exclaimed. “I want to do something violent, to let\noff steam!”\n\n“I ‘ll tell you what to do, this lovely weather,” said Cecilia. “Give a\npicnic. It can be as violent as you please, and it will have the merit\nof leading off our emotion into a safe channel, as well as yours.”\n\nRoderick laughed uproariously at Cecilia’s very practical remedy for his\nsentimental need, but a couple of days later, nevertheless, the picnic\nwas given. It was to be a family party, but Roderick, in his magnanimous\ngeniality, insisted on inviting Mr. Striker, a decision which Rowland\nmentally applauded. “And we ‘ll have Mrs. Striker, too,” he said, “if\nshe ‘ll come, to keep my mother in countenance; and at any rate we\n‘ll have Miss Striker--the divine Petronilla!” The young lady thus\ndenominated formed, with Mrs. Hudson, Miss Garland, and Cecilia, the\nfeminine half of the company. Mr. Striker presented himself, sacrificing\na morning’s work, with a magnanimity greater even than Roderick’s, and\nforeign support was further secured in the person of Mr. Whitefoot, the\nyoung Orthodox minister. Roderick had chosen the feasting-place; he\nknew it well and had passed many a summer afternoon there, lying at his\nlength on the grass and gazing at the blue undulations of the horizon.\nIt was a meadow on the edge of a wood, with mossy rocks protruding\nthrough the grass and a little lake on the other side. It was a\ncloudless August day; Rowland always remembered it, and the scene, and\neverything that was said and done, with extraordinary distinctness.\nRoderick surpassed himself in friendly jollity, and at one moment, when\nexhilaration was at the highest, was seen in Mr. Striker’s high white\nhat, drinking champagne from a broken tea-cup to Mr. Striker’s health.\nMiss Striker had her father’s pale blue eye; she was dressed as if she\nwere going to sit for her photograph, and remained for a long time with\nRoderick on a little promontory overhanging the lake. Mrs. Hudson sat\nall day with a little meek, apprehensive smile. She was afraid of an\n“accident,” though unless Miss Striker (who indeed was a little of\na romp) should push Roderick into the lake, it was hard to see what\naccident could occur. Mrs. Hudson was as neat and crisp and uncrumpled\nat the end of the festival as at the beginning. Mr. Whitefoot, who but\na twelvemonth later became a convert to episcopacy and was already\ncultivating a certain conversational sonority, devoted himself to\nCecilia. He had a little book in his pocket, out of which he read to\nher at intervals, lying stretched at her feet, and it was a lasting joke\nwith Cecilia, afterwards, that she would never tell what Mr. Whitefoot’s\nlittle book had been. Rowland had placed himself near Miss Garland,\nwhile the feasting went forward on the grass. She wore a so-called gypsy\nhat--a little straw hat, tied down over her ears, so as to cast her\neyes into shadow, by a ribbon passing outside of it. When the company\ndispersed, after lunch, he proposed to her to take a stroll in the\nwood. She hesitated a moment and looked toward Mrs. Hudson, as if for\npermission to leave her. But Mrs. Hudson was listening to Mr. Striker,\nwho sat gossiping to her with relaxed magniloquence, his waistcoat\nunbuttoned and his hat on his nose.\n\n“You can give your cousin your society at any time,” said Rowland. “But\nme, perhaps, you ‘ll never see again.”\n\n“Why then should we wish to be friends, if nothing is to come of it?”\n she asked, with homely logic. But by this time she had consented, and\nthey were treading the fallen pine-needles.\n\n“Oh, one must take all one can get,” said Rowland. “If we can be friends\nfor half an hour, it ‘s so much gained.”\n\n“Do you expect never to come back to Northampton again?”\n\n“‘Never’ is a good deal to say. But I go to Europe for a long stay.”\n\n“Do you prefer it so much to your own country?”\n\n“I will not say that. But I have the misfortune to be a rather idle man,\nand in Europe the burden of idleness is less heavy than here.”\n\nShe was silent for a few minutes; then at last, “In that, then, we are\nbetter than Europe,” she said. To a certain point Rowland agreed with\nher, but he demurred, to make her say more.\n\n“Would n’t it be better,” she asked, “to work to get reconciled to\nAmerica, than to go to Europe to get reconciled to idleness?”\n\n“Doubtless; but you know work is hard to find.”\n\n“I come from a little place where every one has plenty,” said Miss\nGarland. “We all work; every one I know works. And really,” she added\npresently, “I look at you with curiosity; you are the first unoccupied\nman I ever saw.”\n\n“Don’t look at me too hard,” said Rowland, smiling. “I shall sink into\nthe earth. What is the name of your little place?”\n\n“West Nazareth,” said Miss Garland, with her usual sobriety. “It is not\nso very little, though it ‘s smaller than Northampton.”\n\n“I wonder whether I could find any work at West Nazareth,” Rowland said.\n\n“You would not like it,” Miss Garland declared reflectively. “Though\nthere are far finer woods there than this. We have miles and miles of\nwoods.”\n\n“I might chop down trees,” said Rowland. “That is, if you allow it.”\n\n“Allow it? Why, where should we get our firewood?” Then, noticing that\nhe had spoken jestingly, she glanced at him askance, though with no\nvisible diminution of her gravity. “Don’t you know how to do anything?\nHave you no profession?”\n\nRowland shook his head. “Absolutely none.”\n\n“What do you do all day?”\n\n“Nothing worth relating. That ‘s why I am going to Europe. There, at\nleast, if I do nothing, I shall see a great deal; and if I ‘m not a\nproducer, I shall at any rate be an observer.”\n\n“Can’t we observe everywhere?”\n\n“Certainly; and I really think that in that way I make the most of my\nopportunities. Though I confess,” he continued, “that I often remember\nthere are things to be seen here to which I probably have n’t done\njustice. I should like, for instance, to see West Nazareth.”\n\nShe looked round at him, open-eyed; not, apparently, that she exactly\nsupposed he was jesting, for the expression of such a desire was not\nnecessarily facetious; but as if he must have spoken with an ulterior\nmotive. In fact, he had spoken from the simplest of motives. The girl\nbeside him pleased him unspeakably, and, suspecting that her charm\nwas essentially her own and not reflected from social circumstance,\nhe wished to give himself the satisfaction of contrasting her with the\nmeagre influences of her education. Miss Garland’s second movement was\nto take him at his word. “Since you are free to do as you please, why\ndon’t you go there?”\n\n“I am not free to do as I please now. I have offered your cousin to bear\nhim company to Europe, he has accepted with enthusiasm, and I cannot\nretract.”\n\n“Are you going to Europe simply for his sake?”\n\nRowland hesitated a moment. “I think I may almost say so.”\n\nMiss Garland walked along in silence. “Do you mean to do a great deal\nfor him?” she asked at last.\n\n“What I can. But my power of helping him is very small beside his power\nof helping himself.”\n\nFor a moment she was silent again. “You are very generous,” she said,\nalmost solemnly.\n\n“No, I am simply very shrewd. Roderick will repay me. It ‘s an\ninvestment. At first, I think,” he added shortly afterwards, “you would\nnot have paid me that compliment. You distrusted me.”\n\nShe made no attempt to deny it. “I did n’t see why you should wish to\nmake Roderick discontented. I thought you were rather frivolous.”\n\n“You did me injustice. I don’t think I ‘m that.”\n\n“It was because you are unlike other men--those, at least, whom I have\nseen.”\n\n“In what way?”\n\n“Why, as you describe yourself. You have no duties, no profession, no\nhome. You live for your pleasure.”\n\n“That ‘s all very true. And yet I maintain I ‘m not frivolous.”\n\n“I hope not,” said Miss Garland, simply. They had reached a point where\nthe wood-path forked and put forth two divergent tracks which lost\nthemselves in a verdurous tangle. Miss Garland seemed to think that the\ndifficulty of choice between them was a reason for giving them up and\nturning back. Rowland thought otherwise, and detected agreeable grounds\nfor preference in the left-hand path. As a compromise, they sat down on\na fallen log. Looking about him, Rowland espied a curious wild shrub,\nwith a spotted crimson leaf; he went and plucked a spray of it and\nbrought it to Miss Garland. He had never observed it before, but she\nimmediately called it by its name. She expressed surprise at his not\nknowing it; it was extremely common. He presently brought her a specimen\nof another delicate plant, with a little blue-streaked flower. “I\nsuppose that ‘s common, too,” he said, “but I have never seen it--or\nnoticed it, at least.” She answered that this one was rare, and\nmeditated a moment before she could remember its name. At last she\nrecalled it, and expressed surprise at his having found the plant in the\nwoods; she supposed it grew only in open marshes. Rowland complimented\nher on her fund of useful information.\n\n“It ‘s not especially useful,” she answered; “but I like to know the\nnames of plants as I do those of my acquaintances. When we walk in the\nwoods at home--which we do so much--it seems as unnatural not to know\nwhat to call the flowers as it would be to see some one in the town with\nwhom we were not on speaking terms.”\n\n“Apropos of frivolity,” Rowland said, “I ‘m sure you have very little\nof it, unless at West Nazareth it is considered frivolous to walk in the\nwoods and nod to the nodding flowers. Do kindly tell me a little about\nyourself.” And to compel her to begin, “I know you come of a race of\ntheologians,” he went on.\n\n“No,” she replied, deliberating; “they are not theologians, though they\nare ministers. We don’t take a very firm stand upon doctrine; we are\npractical, rather. We write sermons and preach them, but we do a great\ndeal of hard work beside.”\n\n“And of this hard work what has your share been?”\n\n“The hardest part: doing nothing.”\n\n“What do you call nothing?”\n\n“I taught school a while: I must make the most of that. But I confess I\ndid n’t like it. Otherwise, I have only done little things at home, as\nthey turned up.”\n\n“What kind of things?”\n\n“Oh, every kind. If you had seen my home, you would understand.”\n\nRowland would have liked to make her specify; but he felt a more urgent\nneed to respect her simplicity than he had ever felt to defer to the\ncomplex circumstance of certain other women. “To be happy, I imagine,”\n he contented himself with saying, “you need to be occupied. You need to\nhave something to expend yourself upon.”\n\n“That is not so true as it once was; now that I am older, I am sure I am\nless impatient of leisure. Certainly, these two months that I have been\nwith Mrs. Hudson, I have had a terrible amount of it. And yet I have\nliked it! And now that I am probably to be with her all the while that\nher son is away, I look forward to more with a resignation that I don’t\nquite know what to make of.”\n\n“It is settled, then, that you are to remain with your cousin?”\n\n“It depends upon their writing from home that I may stay. But that is\nprobable. Only I must not forget,” she said, rising, “that the ground\nfor my doing so is that she be not left alone.”\n\n“I am glad to know,” said Rowland, “that I shall probably often hear\nabout you. I assure you I shall often think about you!” These words were\nhalf impulsive, half deliberate. They were the simple truth, and he had\nasked himself why he should not tell her the truth. And yet they were\nnot all of it; her hearing the rest would depend upon the way she\nreceived this. She received it not only, as Rowland foresaw, without\na shadow of coquetry, of any apparent thought of listening to it\ngracefully, but with a slight movement of nervous deprecation, which\nseemed to betray itself in the quickening of her step. Evidently, if\nRowland was to take pleasure in hearing about her, it would have to be a\nhighly disinterested pleasure. She answered nothing, and Rowland too,\nas he walked beside her, was silent; but as he looked along the\nshadow-woven wood-path, what he was really facing was a level three\nyears of disinterestedness. He ushered them in by talking composed\ncivility until he had brought Miss Garland back to her companions.\n\nHe saw her but once again. He was obliged to be in New York a couple of\ndays before sailing, and it was arranged that Roderick should overtake\nhim at the last moment. The evening before he left Northampton he went\nto say farewell to Mrs. Hudson. The ceremony was brief. Rowland soon\nperceived that the poor little lady was in the melting mood, and, as he\ndreaded her tears, he compressed a multitude of solemn promises into a\nsilent hand-shake and took his leave. Miss Garland, she had told him,\nwas in the back-garden with Roderick: he might go out to them. He did\nso, and as he drew near he heard Roderick’s high-pitched voice ringing\nbehind the shrubbery. In a moment, emerging, he found Miss Garland\nleaning against a tree, with her cousin before her talking with great\nemphasis. He asked pardon for interrupting them, and said he wished only\nto bid her good-by. She gave him her hand and he made her his bow in\nsilence. “Don’t forget,” he said to Roderick, as he turned away. “And\ndon’t, in this company, repent of your bargain.”\n\n“I shall not let him,” said Miss Garland, with something very like\ngayety. “I shall see that he is punctual. He must go! I owe you an\napology for having doubted that he ought to.” And in spite of the dusk\nRowland could see that she had an even finer smile than he had supposed.\n\nRoderick was punctual, eagerly punctual, and they went. Rowland for\nseveral days was occupied with material cares, and lost sight of his\nsentimental perplexities. But they only slumbered, and they were\nsharply awakened. The weather was fine, and the two young men always sat\ntogether upon deck late into the evening. One night, toward the last,\nthey were at the stern of the great ship, watching her grind the solid\nblackness of the ocean into phosphorescent foam. They talked on these\noccasions of everything conceivable, and had the air of having no\nsecrets from each other. But it was on Roderick’s conscience that this\nair belied him, and he was too frank by nature, moreover, for permanent\nreticence on any point.\n\n“I must tell you something,” he said at last. “I should like you to know\nit, and you will be so glad to know it. Besides, it ‘s only a question\nof time; three months hence, probably, you would have guessed it. I am\nengaged to Mary Garland.”\n\nRowland sat staring; though the sea was calm, it seemed to him that the\nship gave a great dizzying lurch. But in a moment he contrived to\nanswer coherently: “Engaged to Miss Garland! I never supposed--I never\nimagined”--\n\n“That I was in love with her?” Roderick interrupted. “Neither did I,\nuntil this last fortnight. But you came and put me into such ridiculous\ngood-humor that I felt an extraordinary desire to tell some woman that I\nadored her. Miss Garland is a magnificent girl; you know her too little\nto do her justice. I have been quietly learning to know her, these\npast three months, and have been falling in love with her without\nbeing conscious of it. It appeared, when I spoke to her, that she had\na kindness for me. So the thing was settled. I must of course make some\nmoney before we can marry. It ‘s rather droll, certainly, to engage\none’s self to a girl whom one is going to leave the next day, for years.\nWe shall be condemned, for some time to come, to do a terrible deal\nof abstract thinking about each other. But I wanted her blessing on my\ncareer and I could not help asking for it. Unless a man is unnaturally\nselfish he needs to work for some one else than himself, and I am sure\nI shall run a smoother and swifter course for knowing that that fine\ncreature is waiting, at Northampton, for news of my greatness. If ever I\nam a dull companion and over-addicted to moping, remember in justice\nto me that I am in love and that my sweetheart is five thousand miles\naway.”\n\nRowland listened to all this with a sort of feeling that fortune had\nplayed him an elaborately-devised trick. It had lured him out into\nmid-ocean and smoothed the sea and stilled the winds and given him a\nsingularly sympathetic comrade, and then it had turned and delivered him\na thumping blow in mid-chest. “Yes,” he said, after an attempt at the\nusual formal congratulation, “you certainly ought to do better--with\nMiss Garland waiting for you at Northampton.”\n\nRoderick, now that he had broken ground, was eloquent and rung a hundred\nchanges on the assurance that he was a very happy man. Then at last,\nsuddenly, his climax was a yawn, and he declared that he must go to bed.\nRowland let him go alone, and sat there late, between sea and sky.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Rome\n\nOne warm, still day, late in the Roman autumn, our two young men were\nsitting beneath one of the high-stemmed pines of the Villa Ludovisi.\nThey had been spending an hour in the mouldy little garden-house, where\nthe colossal mask of the famous Juno looks out with blank eyes from that\ndusky corner which must seem to her the last possible stage of a lapse\nfrom Olympus. Then they had wandered out into the gardens, and\nwere lounging away the morning under the spell of their magical\npicturesqueness. Roderick declared that he would go nowhere else; that,\nafter the Juno, it was a profanation to look at anything but sky and\ntrees. There was a fresco of Guercino, to which Rowland, though he had\nseen it on his former visit to Rome, went dutifully to pay his respects.\nBut Roderick, though he had never seen it, declared that it could n’t\nbe worth a fig, and that he did n’t care to look at ugly things. He\nremained stretched on his overcoat, which he had spread on the grass,\nwhile Rowland went off envying the intellectual comfort of genius, which\ncan arrive at serene conclusions without disagreeable processes. When\nthe latter came back, his friend was sitting with his elbows on his\nknees and his head in his hands. Rowland, in the geniality of a mood\nattuned to the mellow charm of a Roman villa, found a good word to say\nfor the Guercino; but he chiefly talked of the view from the little\nbelvedere on the roof of the casino, and how it looked like the prospect\nfrom a castle turret in a fairy tale.\n\n“Very likely,” said Roderick, throwing himself back with a yawn. “But I\nmust let it pass. I have seen enough for the present; I have reached the\ntop of the hill. I have an indigestion of impressions; I must work them\noff before I go in for any more. I don’t want to look at any more of\nother people’s works, for a month--not even at Nature’s own. I want to\nlook at Roderick Hudson’s. The result of it all is that I ‘m not afraid.\nI can but try, as well as the rest of them! The fellow who did that\ngazing goddess yonder only made an experiment. The other day, when I\nwas looking at Michael Angelo’s Moses, I was seized with a kind\nof defiance--a reaction against all this mere passive enjoyment of\ngrandeur. It was a rousing great success, certainly, that rose there\nbefore me, but somehow it was not an inscrutable mystery, and it seemed\nto me, not perhaps that I should some day do as well, but that at least\nI might!”\n\n“As you say, you can but try,” said Rowland. “Success is only passionate\neffort.”\n\n“Well, the passion is blazing; we have been piling on fuel handsomely.\nIt came over me just now that it is exactly three months to a day since\nI left Northampton. I can’t believe it!”\n\n“It certainly seems more.”\n\n“It seems like ten years. What an exquisite ass I was!”\n\n“Do you feel so wise now?”\n\n“Verily! Don’t I look so? Surely I have n’t the same face. Have n’t I a\ndifferent eye, a different expression, a different voice?”\n\n“I can hardly say, because I have seen the transition. But it ‘s very\nlikely. You are, in the literal sense of the word, more civilized. I\ndare say,” added Rowland, “that Miss Garland would think so.”\n\n“That ‘s not what she would call it; she would say I was corrupted.”\n\nRowland asked few questions about Miss Garland, but he always listened\nnarrowly to his companion’s voluntary observations.\n\n“Are you very sure?” he replied.\n\n“Why, she ‘s a stern moralist, and she would infer from my appearance\nthat I had become a cynical sybarite.” Roderick had, in fact, a Venetian\nwatch-chain round his neck and a magnificent Roman intaglio on the third\nfinger of his left hand.\n\n“Will you think I take a liberty,” asked Rowland, “if I say you judge\nher superficially?”\n\n“For heaven’s sake,” cried Roderick, laughing, “don’t tell me she ‘s\nnot a moralist! It was for that I fell in love with her, and with rigid\nvirtue in her person.”\n\n“She is a moralist, but not, as you imply, a narrow one. That ‘s more\nthan a difference in degree; it ‘s a difference in kind. I don’t know\nwhether I ever mentioned it, but I admire her extremely. There is\nnothing narrow about her but her experience; everything else is large.\nMy impression of her is of a person of great capacity, as yet wholly\nunmeasured and untested. Some day or other, I ‘m sure, she will judge\nfairly and wisely of everything.”\n\n“Stay a bit!” cried Roderick; “you ‘re a better Catholic than the Pope.\nI shall be content if she judges fairly of me--of my merits, that is.\nThe rest she must not judge at all. She ‘s a grimly devoted little\ncreature; may she always remain so! Changed as I am, I adore her none\nthe less. What becomes of all our emotions, our impressions,” he went\non, after a long pause, “all the material of thought that life pours\ninto us at such a rate during such a memorable three months as these?\nThere are twenty moments a week--a day, for that matter, some days--that\nseem supreme, twenty impressions that seem ultimate, that appear to\nform an intellectual era. But others come treading on their heels and\nsweeping them along, and they all melt like water into water and settle\nthe question of precedence among themselves. The curious thing is that\nthe more the mind takes in, the more it has space for, and that all\none’s ideas are like the Irish people at home who live in the different\ncorners of a room, and take boarders.”\n\n“I fancy it is our peculiar good luck that we don’t see the limits of\nour minds,” said Rowland. “We are young, compared with what we may one\nday be. That belongs to youth; it is perhaps the best part of it. They\nsay that old people do find themselves at last face to face with a solid\nblank wall, and stand thumping against it in vain. It resounds, it seems\nto have something beyond it, but it won’t move! That ‘s only a reason\nfor living with open doors as long as we can!”\n\n“Open doors?” murmured Roderick. “Yes, let us close no doors that open\nupon Rome. For this, for the mind, is eternal summer! But though my\ndoors may stand open to-day,” he presently added, “I shall see no\nvisitors. I want to pause and breathe; I want to dream of a statue.\nI have been working hard for three months; I have earned a right to a\nreverie.”\n\nRowland, on his side, was not without provision for reflection, and\nthey lingered on in broken, desultory talk. Rowland felt the need for\nintellectual rest, for a truce to present care for churches, statues,\nand pictures, on even better grounds than his companion, inasmuch as\nhe had really been living Roderick’s intellectual life the past three\nmonths, as well as his own. As he looked back on these full-flavored\nweeks, he drew a long breath of satisfaction, almost of relief.\nRoderick, thus far, had justified his confidence and flattered his\nperspicacity; he was rapidly unfolding into an ideal brilliancy. He was\nchanged even more than he himself suspected; he had stepped, without\nfaltering, into his birthright, and was spending money, intellectually,\nas lavishly as a young heir who has just won an obstructive lawsuit.\nRoderick’s glance and voice were the same, doubtless, as when they\nenlivened the summer dusk on Cecilia’s veranda, but in his person,\ngenerally, there was an indefinable expression of experience rapidly\nand easily assimilated. Rowland had been struck at the outset with the\ninstinctive quickness of his observation and his free appropriation of\nwhatever might serve his purpose. He had not been, for instance, half\nan hour on English soil before he perceived that he was dressed like\na rustic, and he had immediately reformed his toilet with the most\nunerring tact. His appetite for novelty was insatiable, and for\neverything characteristically foreign, as it presented itself, he had an\nextravagant greeting; but in half an hour the novelty had faded, he had\nguessed the secret, he had plucked out the heart of the mystery and was\nclamoring for a keener sensation. At the end of a month, he presented,\nmentally, a puzzling spectacle to his companion. He had caught,\ninstinctively, the key-note of the old world. He observed and enjoyed,\nhe criticised and rhapsodized, but though all things interested him and\nmany delighted him, none surprised him; he had divined their logic\nand measured their proportions, and referred them infallibly to their\ncategories. Witnessing the rate at which he did intellectual execution\non the general spectacle of European life, Rowland at moments felt\nvaguely uneasy for the future; the boy was living too fast, he would\nhave said, and giving alarming pledges to ennui in his later years. But\nwe must live as our pulses are timed, and Roderick’s struck the hour\nvery often. He was, by imagination, though he never became in manner, a\nnatural man of the world; he had intuitively, as an artist, what one may\ncall the historic consciousness. He had a relish for social subtleties\nand mysteries, and, in perception, when occasion offered him an inch he\nnever failed to take an ell. A single glimpse of a social situation of\nthe elder type enabled him to construct the whole, with all its complex\nchiaroscuro, and Rowland more than once assured him that he made him\nbelieve in the metempsychosis, and that he must have lived in European\nsociety, in the last century, as a gentleman in a cocked hat and\nbrocaded waistcoat. Hudson asked Rowland questions which poor Rowland\nwas quite unable to answer, and of which he was equally unable to\nconceive where he had picked up the data. Roderick ended by answering\nthem himself, tolerably to his satisfaction, and in a short time he\nhad almost turned the tables and become in their walks and talks the\naccredited source of information. Rowland told him that when he turned\nsculptor a capital novelist was spoiled, and that to match his eye for\nsocial detail one would have to go to Honore de Balzac. In all this\nRowland took a generous pleasure; he felt an especial kindness for his\ncomrade’s radiant youthfulness of temperament. He was so much younger\nthan he himself had ever been! And surely youth and genius, hand in\nhand, were the most beautiful sight in the world. Roderick added to this\nthe charm of his more immediately personal qualities. The vivacity of\nhis perceptions, the audacity of his imagination, the picturesqueness\nof his phrase when he was pleased,--and even more when he was\ndispleased,--his abounding good-humor, his candor, his unclouded\nfrankness, his unfailing impulse to share every emotion and impression\nwith his friend; all this made comradeship a pure felicity, and\ninterfused with a deeper amenity their long evening talks at cafe doors\nin Italian towns.\n\nThey had gone almost immediately to Paris, and had spent their days at\nthe Louvre and their evenings at the theatre. Roderick was divided in\nmind as to whether Titian or Mademoiselle Delaporte was the greater\nartist. They had come down through France to Genoa and Milan, had spent\na fortnight in Venice and another in Florence, and had now been a month\nin Rome. Roderick had said that he meant to spend three months in simply\nlooking, absorbing, and reflecting, without putting pencil to paper. He\nlooked indefatigably, and certainly saw great things--things greater,\ndoubtless, at times, than the intentions of the artist. And yet he made\nfew false steps and wasted little time in theories of what he ought to\nlike and to dislike. He judged instinctively and passionately, but\nnever vulgarly. At Venice, for a couple of days, he had half a fit of\nmelancholy over the pretended discovery that he had missed his way, and\nthat the only proper vestment of plastic conceptions was the coloring\nof Titian and Paul Veronese. Then one morning the two young men had\nthemselves rowed out to Torcello, and Roderick lay back for a couple\nof hours watching a brown-breasted gondolier making superb muscular\nmovements, in high relief, against the sky of the Adriatic, and at the\nend jerked himself up with a violence that nearly swamped the gondola,\nand declared that the only thing worth living for was to make a colossal\nbronze and set it aloft in the light of a public square. In Rome his\nfirst care was for the Vatican; he went there again and again. But the\nold imperial and papal city altogether delighted him; only there he\nreally found what he had been looking for from the first--the complete\nantipodes of Northampton. And indeed Rome is the natural home of those\nspirits with which we just now claimed fellowship for Roderick--the\nspirits with a deep relish for the artificial element in life and\nthe infinite superpositions of history. It is the immemorial city of\nconvention. The stagnant Roman air is charged with convention; it colors\nthe yellow light and deepens the chilly shadows. And in that still\nrecent day the most impressive convention in all history was visible to\nmen’s eyes, in the Roman streets, erect in a gilded coach drawn by four\nblack horses. Roderick’s first fortnight was a high aesthetic revel.\nHe declared that Rome made him feel and understand more things than\nhe could express: he was sure that life must have there, for all one’s\nsenses, an incomparable fineness; that more interesting things must\nhappen to one than anywhere else. And he gave Rowland to understand that\nhe meant to live freely and largely, and be as interested as occasion\ndemanded. Rowland saw no reason to regard this as a menace of\ndissipation, because, in the first place, there was in all dissipation,\nrefine it as one might, a grossness which would disqualify it for\nRoderick’s favor, and because, in the second, the young sculptor was\na man to regard all things in the light of his art, to hand over his\npassions to his genius to be dealt with, and to find that he could live\nlargely enough without exceeding the circle of wholesome curiosity.\nRowland took immense satisfaction in his companion’s deep impatience to\nmake something of all his impressions. Some of these indeed found their\nway into a channel which did not lead to statues, but it was none the\nless a safe one. He wrote frequent long letters to Miss Garland; when\nRowland went with him to post them he thought wistfully of the\nfortune of the great loosely-written missives, which cost Roderick\nunconscionable sums in postage. He received punctual answers of a more\nfrugal form, written in a clear, minute hand, on paper vexatiously thin.\nIf Rowland was present when they came, he turned away and thought of\nother things--or tried to. These were the only moments when his\nsympathy halted, and they were brief. For the rest he let the days go by\nunprotestingly, and enjoyed Roderick’s serene efflorescence as he would\nhave done a beautiful summer sunrise. Rome, for the past month, had been\ndelicious. The annual descent of the Goths had not yet begun, and sunny\nleisure seemed to brood over the city.\n\nRoderick had taken out a note-book and was roughly sketching a memento\nof the great Juno. Suddenly there was a noise on the gravel, and the\nyoung men, looking up, saw three persons advancing. One was a woman\nof middle age, with a rather grand air and a great many furbelows. She\nlooked very hard at our friends as she passed, and glanced back over her\nshoulder, as if to hasten the step of a young girl who slowly followed\nher. She had such an expansive majesty of mien that Rowland supposed she\nmust have some proprietary right in the villa and was not just then in\na hospitable mood. Beside her walked a little elderly man, tightly\nbuttoned in a shabby black coat, but with a flower in his lappet, and a\npair of soiled light gloves. He was a grotesque-looking personage,\nand might have passed for a gentleman of the old school, reduced by\nadversity to playing cicerone to foreigners of distinction. He had a\nlittle black eye which glittered like a diamond and rolled about like a\nball of quicksilver, and a white moustache, cut short and stiff, like a\nworn-out brush. He was smiling with extreme urbanity, and talking in a\nlow, mellifluous voice to the lady, who evidently was not listening\nto him. At a considerable distance behind this couple strolled a young\ngirl, apparently of about twenty. She was tall and slender, and dressed\nwith extreme elegance; she led by a cord a large poodle of the most\nfantastic aspect. He was combed and decked like a ram for sacrifice; his\ntrunk and haunches were of the most transparent pink, his fleecy head\nand shoulders as white as jeweler’s cotton, and his tail and ears\nornamented with long blue ribbons. He stepped along stiffly and solemnly\nbeside his mistress, with an air of conscious elegance. There was\nsomething at first slightly ridiculous in the sight of a young lady\ngravely appended to an animal of these incongruous attributes, and\nRoderick, with his customary frankness, greeted the spectacle with a\nconfident smile. The young girl perceived it and turned her face full\nupon him, with a gaze intended apparently to enforce greater deference.\nIt was not deference, however, her face provoked, but startled,\nsubmissive admiration; Roderick’s smile fell dead, and he sat eagerly\nstaring. A pair of extraordinary dark blue eyes, a mass of dusky hair\nover a low forehead, a blooming oval of perfect purity, a flexible\nlip, just touched with disdain, the step and carriage of a tired\nprincess--these were the general features of his vision. The young lady\nwas walking slowly and letting her long dress rustle over the gravel;\nthe young men had time to see her distinctly before she averted her\nface and went her way. She left a vague, sweet perfume behind her as she\npassed.\n\n“Immortal powers!” cried Roderick, “what a vision! In the name of\ntranscendent perfection, who is she?” He sprang up and stood looking\nafter her until she rounded a turn in the avenue. “What a movement, what\na manner, what a poise of the head! I wonder if she would sit to me.”\n\n“You had better go and ask her,” said Rowland, laughing. “She is\ncertainly most beautiful.”\n\n“Beautiful? She ‘s beauty itself--she ‘s a revelation. I don’t believe\nshe is living--she ‘s a phantasm, a vapor, an illusion!”\n\n“The poodle,” said Rowland, “is certainly alive.”\n\n“Nay, he too may be a grotesque phantom, like the black dog in Faust.”\n\n“I hope at least that the young lady has nothing in common with\nMephistopheles. She looked dangerous.”\n\n“If beauty is immoral, as people think at Northampton,” said Roderick,\n“she is the incarnation of evil. The mamma and the queer old gentleman,\nmoreover, are a pledge of her reality. Who are they all?”\n\n“The Prince and Princess Ludovisi and the principessina,” suggested\nRowland.\n\n“There are no such people,” said Roderick. “Besides, the little old man\nis not the papa.” Rowland smiled, wondering how he had ascertained\nthese facts, and the young sculptor went on. “The old man is a Roman, a\nhanger-on of the mamma, a useful personage who now and then gets asked\nto dinner. The ladies are foreigners, from some Northern country; I\nwon’t say which.”\n\n“Perhaps from the State of Maine,” said Rowland.\n\n“No, she ‘s not an American, I ‘ll lay a wager on that. She ‘s a\ndaughter of this elder world. We shall see her again, I pray my stars;\nbut if we don’t, I shall have done something I never expected to--I\nshall have had a glimpse of ideal beauty.” He sat down again and went\non with his sketch of the Juno, scrawled away for ten minutes, and then\nhanded the result in silence to Rowland. Rowland uttered an exclamation\nof surprise and applause. The drawing represented the Juno as to the\nposition of the head, the brow, and the broad fillet across the hair;\nbut the eyes, the mouth, the physiognomy were a vivid portrait of\nthe young girl with the poodle. “I have been wanting a subject,” said\nRoderick: “there ‘s one made to my hand! And now for work!”\n\nThey saw no more of the young girl, though Roderick looked hopefully,\nfor some days, into the carriages on the Pincian. She had evidently been\nbut passing through Rome; Naples or Florence now happily possessed her,\nand she was guiding her fleecy companion through the Villa Reale or the\nBoboli Gardens with the same superb defiance of irony. Roderick went to\nwork and spent a month shut up in his studio; he had an idea, and he was\nnot to rest till he had embodied it. He had established himself in\nthe basement of a huge, dusky, dilapidated old house, in that long,\ntortuous, and preeminently Roman street which leads from the Corso to\nthe Bridge of St. Angelo. The black archway which admitted you might\nhave served as the portal of the Augean stables, but you emerged\npresently upon a mouldy little court, of which the fourth side was\nformed by a narrow terrace, overhanging the Tiber. Here, along the\nparapet, were stationed half a dozen shapeless fragments of sculpture,\nwith a couple of meagre orange-trees in terra-cotta tubs, and an\noleander that never flowered. The unclean, historic river swept beneath;\nbehind were dusky, reeking walls, spotted here and there with hanging\nrags and flower-pots in windows; opposite, at a distance, were the bare\nbrown banks of the stream, the huge rotunda of St. Angelo, tipped with\nits seraphic statue, the dome of St. Peter’s, and the broad-topped pines\nof the Villa Doria. The place was crumbling and shabby and melancholy,\nbut the river was delightful, the rent was a trifle, and everything was\npicturesque. Roderick was in the best humor with his quarters from the\nfirst, and was certain that the working mood there would be intenser\nin an hour than in twenty years of Northampton. His studio was a huge,\nempty room with a vaulted ceiling, covered with vague, dark traces of an\nold fresco, which Rowland, when he spent an hour with his friend, used\nto stare at vainly for some surviving coherence of floating draperies\nand clasping arms. Roderick had lodged himself economically in the same\nquarter. He occupied a fifth floor on the Ripetta, but he was only at\nhome to sleep, for when he was not at work he was either lounging in\nRowland’s more luxurious rooms or strolling through streets and churches\nand gardens.\n\nRowland had found a convenient corner in a stately old palace not far\nfrom the Fountain of Trevi, and made himself a home to which books and\npictures and prints and odds and ends of curious furniture gave an air\nof leisurely permanence. He had the tastes of a collector; he spent half\nhis afternoons ransacking the dusty magazines of the curiosity-mongers,\nand often made his way, in quest of a prize, into the heart of\nimpecunious Roman households, which had been prevailed upon to\nlisten--with closed doors and an impenetrably wary smile--to proposals\nfor an hereditary “antique.” In the evening, often, under the lamp,\namid dropped curtains and the scattered gleam of firelight upon polished\ncarvings and mellow paintings, the two friends sat with their heads\ntogether, criticising intaglios and etchings, water-color drawings and\nilluminated missals. Roderick’s quick appreciation of every form of\nartistic beauty reminded his companion of the flexible temperament of\nthose Italian artists of the sixteenth century who were indifferently\npainters and sculptors, sonneteers and engravers. At times when he saw\nhow the young sculptor’s day passed in a single sustained pulsation,\nwhile his own was broken into a dozen conscious devices for disposing of\nthe hours, and intermingled with sighs, half suppressed, some of them,\nfor conscience’ sake, over what he failed of in action and missed in\npossession--he felt a pang of something akin to envy. But Rowland had\ntwo substantial aids for giving patience the air of contentment: he\nwas an inquisitive reader and a passionate rider. He plunged into bulky\nGerman octavos on Italian history, and he spent long afternoons in\nthe saddle, ranging over the grassy desolation of the Campagna. As the\nseason went on and the social groups began to constitute themselves, he\nfound that he knew a great many people and that he had easy opportunity\nfor knowing others. He enjoyed a quiet corner of a drawing-room beside\nan agreeable woman, and although the machinery of what calls itself\nsociety seemed to him to have many superfluous wheels, he accepted\ninvitations and made visits punctiliously, from the conviction that\nthe only way not to be overcome by the ridiculous side of most of such\nobservances is to take them with exaggerated gravity. He introduced\nRoderick right and left, and suffered him to make his way himself--an\nenterprise for which Roderick very soon displayed an all-sufficient\ncapacity. Wherever he went he made, not exactly what is called a\nfavorable impression, but what, from a practical point of view, is\nbetter--a puzzling one. He took to evening parties as a duck to water,\nand before the winter was half over was the most freely and frequently\ndiscussed young man in the heterogeneous foreign colony. Rowland’s\ntheory of his own duty was to let him run his course and play his\ncards, only holding himself ready to point out shoals and pitfalls,\nand administer a friendly propulsion through tight places. Roderick’s\nmanners on the precincts of the Pincian were quite the same as his\nmanners on Cecilia’s veranda: that is, they were no manners at all. But\nit remained as true as before that it would have been impossible, on the\nwhole, to violate ceremony with less of lasting offense. He interrupted,\nhe contradicted, he spoke to people he had never seen, and left his\nsocial creditors without the smallest conversational interest on their\nloans; he lounged and yawned, he talked loud when he should have\ntalked low, and low when he should have talked loud. Many people, in\nconsequence, thought him insufferably conceited, and declared that he\nought to wait till he had something to show for his powers, before he\nassumed the airs of a spoiled celebrity. But to Rowland and to most\nfriendly observers this judgment was quite beside the mark, and the\nyoung man’s undiluted naturalness was its own justification. He\nwas impulsive, spontaneous, sincere; there were so many people at\ndinner-tables and in studios who were not, that it seemed worth while\nto allow this rare specimen all possible freedom of action. If Roderick\ntook the words out of your mouth when you were just prepared to deliver\nthem with the most effective accent, he did it with a perfect good\nconscience and with no pretension of a better right to being heard, but\nsimply because he was full to overflowing of his own momentary thought\nand it sprang from his lips without asking leave. There were persons who\nwaited on your periods much more deferentially, who were a hundred\ntimes more capable than Roderick of a reflective impertinence. Roderick\nreceived from various sources, chiefly feminine, enough finely-adjusted\nadvice to have established him in life as an embodiment of the\nproprieties, and he received it, as he afterwards listened to criticisms\non his statues, with unfaltering candor and good-humor. Here and there,\ndoubtless, as he went, he took in a reef in his sail; but he was too\nadventurous a spirit to be successfully tamed, and he remained at\nmost points the florid, rather strident young Virginian whose serene\ninflexibility had been the despair of Mr. Striker. All this was what\nfriendly commentators (still chiefly feminine) alluded to when they\nspoke of his delightful freshness, and critics of harsher sensibilities\n(of the other sex) when they denounced his damned impertinence. His\nappearance enforced these impressions--his handsome face, his radiant,\nunaverted eyes, his childish, unmodulated voice. Afterwards, when those\nwho loved him were in tears, there was something in all this unspotted\ncomeliness that seemed to lend a mockery to the causes of their sorrow.\n\nCertainly, among the young men of genius who, for so many ages, have\ngone up to Rome to test their powers, none ever made a fairer beginning\nthan Roderick. He rode his two horses at once with extraordinary good\nfortune; he established the happiest modus vivendi betwixt work and\nplay. He wrestled all day with a mountain of clay in his studio, and\nchattered half the night away in Roman drawing-rooms. It all seemed part\nof a kind of divine facility. He was passionately interested, he was\nfeeling his powers; now that they had thoroughly kindled in the glowing\naesthetic atmosphere of Rome, the ardent young fellow should be pardoned\nfor believing that he never was to see the end of them. He enjoyed\nimmeasurably, after the chronic obstruction of home, the downright\nact of production. He kept models in his studio till they dropped with\nfatigue; he drew, on other days, at the Capitol and the Vatican, till\nhis own head swam with his eagerness, and his limbs stiffened with the\ncold. He had promptly set up a life-sized figure which he called\nan “Adam,” and was pushing it rapidly toward completion. There were\nnaturally a great many wiseheads who smiled at his precipitancy, and\ncited him as one more example of Yankee crudity, a capital recruit to\nthe great army of those who wish to dance before they can walk. They\nwere right, but Roderick was right too, for the success of his statue\nwas not to have been foreseen; it partook, really, of the miraculous. He\nnever surpassed it afterwards, and a good judge here and there has been\nknown to pronounce it the finest piece of sculpture of our modern\nera. To Rowland it seemed to justify superbly his highest hopes of his\nfriend, and he said to himself that if he had invested his happiness\nin fostering a genius, he ought now to be in possession of a boundless\ncomplacency. There was something especially confident and masterly in\nthe artist’s negligence of all such small picturesque accessories\nas might serve to label his figure to a vulgar apprehension. If it\nrepresented the father of the human race and the primal embodiment of\nhuman sensation, it did so in virtue of its look of balanced physical\nperfection, and deeply, eagerly sentient vitality. Rowland, in fraternal\nzeal, traveled up to Carrara and selected at the quarries the most\nmagnificent block of marble he could find, and when it came down to\nRome, the two young men had a “celebration.” They drove out to Albano,\nbreakfasted boisterously (in their respective measure) at the inn, and\nlounged away the day in the sun on the top of Monte Cavo. Roderick’s\nhead was full of ideas for other works, which he described with infinite\nspirit and eloquence, as vividly as if they were ranged on their\npedestals before him. He had an indefatigable fancy; things he saw in\nthe streets, in the country, things he heard and read, effects he saw\njust missed or half-expressed in the works of others, acted upon his\nmind as a kind of challenge, and he was terribly restless until, in some\nform or other, he had taken up the glove and set his lance in rest.\n\nThe Adam was put into marble, and all the world came to see it. Of the\ncriticisms passed upon it this history undertakes to offer no record;\nover many of them the two young men had a daily laugh for a month, and\ncertain of the formulas of the connoisseurs, restrictive or indulgent,\nfurnished Roderick with a permanent supply of humorous catch-words. But\npeople enough spoke flattering good-sense to make Roderick feel as if\nhe were already half famous. The statue passed formally into Rowland’s\npossession, and was paid for as if an illustrious name had been chiseled\non the pedestal. Poor Roderick owed every franc of the money. It was not\nfor this, however, but because he was so gloriously in the mood, that,\ndenying himself all breathing-time, on the same day he had given the\nlast touch to the Adam, he began to shape the rough contour of an Eve.\nThis went forward with equal rapidity and success. Roderick lost his\ntemper, time and again, with his models, who offered but a gross,\ndegenerate image of his splendid ideal; but his ideal, as he assured\nRowland, became gradually such a fixed, vivid presence, that he had only\nto shut his eyes to behold a creature far more to his purpose than\nthe poor girl who stood posturing at forty sous an hour. The Eve was\nfinished in a month, and the feat was extraordinary, as well as the\nstatue, which represented an admirably beautiful woman. When the spring\nbegan to muffle the rugged old city with its clambering festoons, it\nseemed to him that he had done a handsome winter’s work and had fairly\nearned a holiday. He took a liberal one, and lounged away the lovely\nRoman May, doing nothing. He looked very contented; with himself,\nperhaps, at times, a trifle too obviously. But who could have said\nwithout good reason? He was “flushed with triumph;” this classic\nphrase portrayed him, to Rowland’s sense. He would lose himself in long\nreveries, and emerge from them with a quickened smile and a heightened\ncolor. Rowland grudged him none of his smiles, and took an extreme\nsatisfaction in his two statues. He had the Adam and the Eve transported\nto his own apartment, and one warm evening in May he gave a little\ndinner in honor of the artist. It was small, but Rowland had meant it\nshould be very agreeably composed. He thought over his friends and chose\nfour. They were all persons with whom he lived in a certain intimacy.\n\nOne of them was an American sculptor of French extraction, or remotely,\nperhaps, of Italian, for he rejoiced in the somewhat fervid name of\nGloriani. He was a man of forty, he had been living for years in Paris\nand in Rome, and he now drove a very pretty trade in sculpture of the\nornamental and fantastic sort. In his youth he had had money; but he\nhad spent it recklessly, much of it scandalously, and at twenty-six\nhad found himself obliged to make capital of his talent. This was quite\ninimitable, and fifteen years of indefatigable exercise had brought\nit to perfection. Rowland admitted its power, though it gave him very\nlittle pleasure; what he relished in the man was the extraordinary\nvivacity and frankness, not to call it the impudence, of his ideas. He\nhad a definite, practical scheme of art, and he knew at least what he\nmeant. In this sense he was solid and complete. There were so many of\nthe aesthetic fraternity who were floundering in unknown seas, without\na notion of which way their noses were turned, that Gloriani, conscious\nand compact, unlimitedly intelligent and consummately clever, dogmatic\nonly as to his own duties, and at once gracefully deferential and\nprofoundly indifferent to those of others, had for Rowland a certain\nintellectual refreshment quite independent of the character of his\nworks. These were considered by most people to belong to a very corrupt,\nand by many to a positively indecent school. Others thought them\ntremendously knowing, and paid enormous prices for them; and indeed, to\nbe able to point to one of Gloriani’s figures in a shady corner of your\nlibrary was tolerable proof that you were not a fool. Corrupt things\nthey certainly were; in the line of sculpture they were quite the latest\nfruit of time. It was the artist’s opinion that there is no essential\ndifference between beauty and ugliness; that they overlap and\nintermingle in a quite inextricable manner; that there is no saying\nwhere one begins and the other ends; that hideousness grimaces at you\nsuddenly from out of the very bosom of loveliness, and beauty blooms\nbefore your eyes in the lap of vileness; that it is a waste of wit to\nnurse metaphysical distinctions, and a sadly meagre entertainment to\ncaress imaginary lines; that the thing to aim at is the expressive, and\nthe way to reach it is by ingenuity; that for this purpose everything\nmay serve, and that a consummate work is a sort of hotch-potch of the\npure and the impure, the graceful and the grotesque. Its prime duty is\nto amuse, to puzzle, to fascinate, to savor of a complex imagination.\nGloriani’s statues were florid and meretricious; they looked like\nmagnified goldsmith’s work. They were extremely elegant, but they had no\ncharm for Rowland. He never bought one, but Gloriani was such an\nhonest fellow, and withal was so deluged with orders, that this made\nno difference in their friendship. The artist might have passed for a\nFrenchman. He was a great talker, and a very picturesque one; he was\nalmost bald; he had a small, bright eye, a broken nose, and a moustache\nwith waxed ends. When sometimes he received you at his lodging, he\nintroduced you to a lady with a plain face whom he called Madame\nGloriani--which she was not.\n\nRowland’s second guest was also an artist, but of a very different type.\nHis friends called him Sam Singleton; he was an American, and he had\nbeen in Rome a couple of years. He painted small landscapes, chiefly in\nwater-colors: Rowland had seen one of them in a shop window, had liked\nit extremely, and, ascertaining his address, had gone to see him and\nfound him established in a very humble studio near the Piazza Barberini,\nwhere, apparently, fame and fortune had not yet found him out. Rowland\ntook a fancy to him and bought several of his pictures; Singleton made\nfew speeches, but was grateful. Rowland heard afterwards that when he\nfirst came to Rome he painted worthless daubs and gave no promise\nof talent. Improvement had come, however, hand in hand with patient\nindustry, and his talent, though of a slender and delicate order, was\nnow incontestable. It was as yet but scantily recognized, and he had\nhard work to live. Rowland hung his little water-colors on the parlor\nwall, and found that, as he lived with them, he grew very fond of\nthem. Singleton was a diminutive, dwarfish personage; he looked like\na precocious child. He had a high, protuberant forehead, a transparent\nbrown eye, a perpetual smile, an extraordinary expression of modesty and\npatience. He listened much more willingly than he talked, with a little\nfixed, grateful grin; he blushed when he spoke, and always offered his\nideas in a sidelong fashion, as if the presumption were against them.\nHis modesty set them off, and they were eminently to the point. He was\nso perfect an example of the little noiseless, laborious artist whom\nchance, in the person of a moneyed patron, has never taken by the hand,\nthat Rowland would have liked to befriend him by stealth. Singleton had\nexpressed a fervent admiration for Roderick’s productions, but had\nnot yet met the young master. Roderick was lounging against the\nchimney-piece when he came in, and Rowland presently introduced him. The\nlittle water-colorist stood with folded hands, blushing, smiling, and\nlooking up at him as if Roderick were himself a statue on a pedestal.\nSingleton began to murmur something about his pleasure, his admiration;\nthe desire to make his compliment smoothly gave him a kind of grotesque\nformalism. Roderick looked down at him surprised, and suddenly burst\ninto a laugh. Singleton paused a moment and then, with an intenser\nsmile, went on: “Well, sir, your statues are beautiful, all the same!”\n\nRowland’s two other guests were ladies, and one of them, Miss Blanchard,\nbelonged also to the artistic fraternity. She was an American, she\nwas young, she was pretty, and she had made her way to Rome alone and\nunaided. She lived alone, or with no other duenna than a bushy-browed\nold serving-woman, though indeed she had a friendly neighbor in the\nperson of a certain Madame Grandoni, who in various social emergencies\nlent her a protecting wing, and had come with her to Rowland’s dinner.\nMiss Blanchard had a little money, but she was not above selling her\npictures. These represented generally a bunch of dew-sprinkled roses,\nwith the dew-drops very highly finished, or else a wayside shrine, and\na peasant woman, with her back turned, kneeling before it. She did backs\nvery well, but she was a little weak in faces. Flowers, however, were\nher speciality, and though her touch was a little old-fashioned and\nfinical, she painted them with remarkable skill. Her pictures were\nchiefly bought by the English. Rowland had made her acquaintance early\nin the winter, and as she kept a saddle horse and rode a great deal,\nhe had asked permission to be her cavalier. In this way they had become\nalmost intimate. Miss Blanchard’s name was Augusta; she was slender,\npale, and elegant looking; she had a very pretty head and brilliant\nauburn hair, which she braided with classical simplicity. She talked in\na sweet, soft voice, used language at times a trifle superfine, and made\nliterary allusions. These had often a patriotic strain, and Rowland had\nmore than once been irritated by her quotations from Mrs. Sigourney in\nthe cork-woods of Monte Mario, and from Mr. Willis among the ruins of\nVeii. Rowland was of a dozen different minds about her, and was half\nsurprised, at times, to find himself treating it as a matter of serious\nmoment whether he liked her or not. He admired her, and indeed there\nwas something admirable in her combination of beauty and talent, of\nisolation and tranquil self-support. He used sometimes to go into the\nlittle, high-niched, ordinary room which served her as a studio, and\nfind her working at a panel six inches square, at an open casement,\nprofiled against the deep blue Roman sky. She received him with a\nmeek-eyed dignity that made her seem like a painted saint on a church\nwindow, receiving the daylight in all her being. The breath of reproach\npassed her by with folded wings. And yet Rowland wondered why he did not\nlike her better. If he failed, the reason was not far to seek. There was\nanother woman whom he liked better, an image in his heart which refused\nto yield precedence.\n\nOn that evening to which allusion has been made, when Rowland was left\nalone between the starlight and the waves with the sudden knowledge\nthat Mary Garland was to become another man’s wife, he had made, after a\nwhile, the simple resolution to forget her. And every day since, like a\nfamous philosopher who wished to abbreviate his mourning for a faithful\nservant, he had said to himself in substance--“Remember to forget Mary\nGarland.” Sometimes it seemed as if he were succeeding; then, suddenly,\nwhen he was least expecting it, he would find her name, inaudibly, on\nhis lips, and seem to see her eyes meeting his eyes. All this made him\nuncomfortable, and seemed to portend a possible discord. Discord was not\nto his taste; he shrank from imperious passions, and the idea of finding\nhimself jealous of an unsuspecting friend was absolutely repulsive. More\nthan ever, then, the path of duty was to forget Mary Garland, and he\ncultivated oblivion, as we may say, in the person of Miss Blanchard. Her\nfine temper, he said to himself, was a trifle cold and conscious, her\npurity prudish, perhaps, her culture pedantic. But since he was obliged\nto give up hopes of Mary Garland, Providence owed him a compensation,\nand he had fits of angry sadness in which it seemed to him that to\nattest his right to sentimental satisfaction he would be capable of\nfalling in love with a woman he absolutely detested, if she were the\nbest that came in his way. And what was the use, after all, of bothering\nabout a possible which was only, perhaps, a dream? Even if Mary Garland\nhad been free, what right had he to assume that he would have pleased\nher? The actual was good enough. Miss Blanchard had beautiful hair, and\nif she was a trifle old-maidish, there is nothing like matrimony for\ncuring old-maidishness.\n\nMadame Grandoni, who had formed with the companion of Rowland’s rides\nan alliance which might have been called defensive on the part of the\nformer and attractive on that of Miss Blanchard, was an excessively ugly\nold lady, highly esteemed in Roman society for her homely benevolence\nand her shrewd and humorous good sense. She had been the widow of a\nGerman archaeologist, who had come to Rome in the early ages as an\nattache of the Prussian legation on the Capitoline. Her good sense had\nbeen wanting on but a single occasion, that of her second marriage. This\noccasion was certainly a momentous one, but these, by common consent,\nare not test cases. A couple of years after her first husband’s death,\nshe had accepted the hand and the name of a Neapolitan music-master, ten\nyears younger than herself, and with no fortune but his fiddle-bow. The\nmarriage was most unhappy, and the Maestro Grandoni was suspected of\nusing the fiddle-bow as an instrument of conjugal correction. He had\nfinally run off with a prima donna assoluta, who, it was to be hoped,\nhad given him a taste of the quality implied in her title. He was\nbelieved to be living still, but he had shrunk to a small black spot\nin Madame Grandoni’s life, and for ten years she had not mentioned\nhis name. She wore a light flaxen wig, which was never very artfully\nadjusted, but this mattered little, as she made no secret of it. She\nused to say, “I was not always so ugly as this; as a young girl I had\nbeautiful golden hair, very much the color of my wig.” She had worn\nfrom time immemorial an old blue satin dress, and a white crape shawl\nembroidered in colors; her appearance was ridiculous, but she had an\ninterminable Teutonic pedigree, and her manners, in every presence, were\neasy and jovial, as became a lady whose ancestor had been cup-bearer\nto Frederick Barbarossa. Thirty years’ observation of Roman society had\nsharpened her wits and given her an inexhaustible store of anecdotes,\nbut she had beneath her crumpled bodice a deep-welling fund of Teutonic\nsentiment, which she communicated only to the objects of her particular\nfavor. Rowland had a great regard for her, and she repaid it by wishing\nhim to get married. She never saw him without whispering to him that\nAugusta Blanchard was just the girl.\n\nIt seemed to Rowland a sort of foreshadowing of matrimony to see Miss\nBlanchard standing gracefully on his hearth-rug and blooming behind\nthe central bouquet at his circular dinner-table. The dinner was very\nprosperous and Roderick amply filled his position as hero of the feast.\nHe had always an air of buoyant enjoyment in his work, but on this\noccasion he manifested a good deal of harmless pleasure in his glory.\nHe drank freely and talked bravely; he leaned back in his chair with\nhis hands in his pockets, and flung open the gates of his eloquence.\nSingleton sat gazing and listening open-mouthed, as if Apollo in person\nwere talking. Gloriani showed a twinkle in his eye and an evident\ndisposition to draw Roderick out. Rowland was rather regretful, for\nhe knew that theory was not his friend’s strong point, and that it was\nnever fair to take his measure from his talk.\n\n“As you have begun with Adam and Eve,” said Gloriani, “I suppose you are\ngoing straight through the Bible.” He was one of the persons who thought\nRoderick delightfully fresh.\n\n“I may make a David,” said Roderick, “but I shall not try any more of\nthe Old Testament people. I don’t like the Jews; I don’t like pendulous\nnoses. David, the boy David, is rather an exception; you can think of\nhim and treat him as a young Greek. Standing forth there on the plain\nof battle between the contending armies, rushing forward to let fly his\nstone, he looks like a beautiful runner at the Olympic games. After that\nI shall skip to the New Testament. I mean to make a Christ.”\n\n“You ‘ll put nothing of the Olympic games into him, I hope,” said\nGloriani.\n\n“Oh, I shall make him very different from the Christ of tradition;\nmore--more”--and Roderick paused a moment to think. This was the first\nthat Rowland had heard of his Christ.\n\n“More rationalistic, I suppose,” suggested Miss Blanchard.\n\n“More idealistic!” cried Roderick. “The perfection of form, you know, to\nsymbolize the perfection of spirit.”\n\n“For a companion piece,” said Miss Blanchard, “you ought to make a\nJudas.”\n\n“Never! I mean never to make anything ugly. The Greeks never made\nanything ugly, and I ‘m a Hellenist; I ‘m not a Hebraist! I have been\nthinking lately of making a Cain, but I should never dream of making\nhim ugly. He should be a very handsome fellow, and he should lift up the\nmurderous club with the beautiful movement of the fighters in the Greek\nfriezes who are chopping at their enemies.”\n\n“There ‘s no use trying to be a Greek,” said Gloriani. “If Phidias were\nto come back, he would recommend you to give it up. I am half Italian\nand half French, and, as a whole, a Yankee. What sort of a Greek should\nI make? I think the Judas is a capital idea for a statue. Much obliged\nto you, madame, for the suggestion. What an insidious little scoundrel\none might make of him, sitting there nursing his money-bag and his\ntreachery! There can be a great deal of expression in a pendulous nose,\nmy dear sir, especially when it is cast in green bronze.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Roderick. “But it is not the sort of expression I\ncare for. I care only for perfect beauty. There it is, if you want to\nknow it! That ‘s as good a profession of faith as another. In future, so\nfar as my things are not positively beautiful, you may set them down as\nfailures. For me, it ‘s either that or nothing. It ‘s against the taste\nof the day, I know; we have really lost the faculty to understand beauty\nin the large, ideal way. We stand like a race with shrunken muscles,\nstaring helplessly at the weights our forefathers easily lifted. But I\ndon’t hesitate to proclaim it--I mean to lift them again! I mean to go\nin for big things; that ‘s my notion of my art. I mean to do things\nthat will be simple and vast and infinite. You ‘ll see if they won’t be\ninfinite! Excuse me if I brag a little; all those Italian fellows in the\nRenaissance used to brag. There was a sensation once common, I am sure,\nin the human breast--a kind of religious awe in the presence of a marble\nimage newly created and expressing the human type in superhuman purity.\nWhen Phidias and Praxiteles had their statues of goddesses unveiled in\nthe temples of the AEgean, don’t you suppose there was a passionate\nbeating of hearts, a thrill of mysterious terror? I mean to bring it\nback; I mean to thrill the world again! I mean to produce a Juno that\nwill make you tremble, a Venus that will make you swoon!”\n\n“So that when we come and see you,” said Madame Grandoni, “we must be\nsure and bring our smelling-bottles. And pray have a few soft sofas\nconveniently placed.”\n\n“Phidias and Praxiteles,” Miss Blanchard remarked, “had the advantage\nof believing in their goddesses. I insist on believing, for myself, that\nthe pagan mythology is not a fiction, and that Venus and Juno and Apollo\nand Mercury used to come down in a cloud into this very city of Rome\nwhere we sit talking nineteenth century English.”\n\n“Nineteenth century nonsense, my dear!” cried Madame Grandoni. “Mr.\nHudson may be a new Phidias, but Venus and Juno--that ‘s you and\nI--arrived to-day in a very dirty cab; and were cheated by the driver,\ntoo.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow,” objected Gloriani, “you don’t mean to say you\nare going to make over in cold blood those poor old exploded Apollos and\nHebes.”\n\n“It won’t matter what you call them,” said Roderick. “They shall be\nsimply divine forms. They shall be Beauty; they shall be Wisdom; they\nshall be Power; they shall be Genius; they shall be Daring. That ‘s all\nthe Greek divinities were.”\n\n“That ‘s rather abstract, you know,” said Miss Blanchard.\n\n“My dear fellow,” cried Gloriani, “you ‘re delightfully young.”\n\n“I hope you ‘ll not grow any older,” said Singleton, with a flush of\nsympathy across his large white forehead. “You can do it if you try.”\n\n“Then there are all the Forces and Mysteries and Elements of Nature,”\n Roderick went on. “I mean to do the Morning; I mean to do the Night! I\nmean to do the Ocean and the Mountains; the Moon and the West Wind. I\nmean to make a magnificent statue of America!”\n\n“America--the Mountains--the Moon!” said Gloriani. “You ‘ll find it\nrather hard, I ‘m afraid, to compress such subjects into classic forms.”\n\n“Oh, there ‘s a way,” cried Roderick, “and I shall think it out. My\nfigures shall make no contortions, but they shall mean a tremendous\ndeal.”\n\n“I ‘m sure there are contortions enough in Michael Angelo,” said Madame\nGrandoni. “Perhaps you don’t approve of him.”\n\n“Oh, Michael Angelo was not me!” said Roderick, with sublimity. There\nwas a great laugh; but after all, Roderick had done some fine things.\n\nRowland had bidden one of the servants bring him a small portfolio of\nprints, and had taken out a photograph of Roderick’s little statue of\nthe youth drinking. It pleased him to see his friend sitting there\nin radiant ardor, defending idealism against so knowing an apostle of\ncorruption as Gloriani, and he wished to help the elder artist to be\nconfuted. He silently handed him the photograph.\n\n“Bless me!” cried Gloriani, “did he do this?”\n\n“Ages ago,” said Roderick.\n\nGloriani looked at the photograph a long time, with evident admiration.\n\n“It ‘s deucedly pretty,” he said at last. “But, my dear young friend,\nyou can’t keep this up.”\n\n“I shall do better,” said Roderick.\n\n“You will do worse! You will become weak. You will have to take to\nviolence, to contortions, to romanticism, in self-defense. This sort\nof thing is like a man trying to lift himself up by the seat of his\ntrousers. He may stand on tiptoe, but he can’t do more. Here you stand\non tiptoe, very gracefully, I admit; but you can’t fly; there ‘s no use\ntrying.”\n\n“My ‘America’ shall answer you!” said Roderick, shaking toward him a\ntall glass of champagne and drinking it down.\n\nSingleton had taken the photograph and was poring over it with a little\nmurmur of delight.\n\n“Was this done in America?” he asked.\n\n“In a square white wooden house at Northampton, Massachusetts,” Roderick\nanswered.\n\n“Dear old white wooden houses!” said Miss Blanchard.\n\n“If you could do as well as this there,” said Singleton, blushing and\nsmiling, “one might say that really you had only to lose by coming to\nRome.”\n\n“Mallet is to blame for that,” said Roderick. “But I am willing to risk\nthe loss.”\n\nThe photograph had been passed to Madame Grandoni. “It reminds me,” she\nsaid, “of the things a young man used to do whom I knew years ago, when\nI first came to Rome. He was a German, a pupil of Overbeck and a votary\nof spiritual art. He used to wear a black velvet tunic and a very low\nshirt collar; he had a neck like a sickly crane, and let his hair grow\ndown to his shoulders. His name was Herr Schafgans. He never painted\nanything so profane as a man taking a drink, but his figures were all\nof the simple and slender and angular pattern, and nothing if not\ninnocent--like this one of yours. He would not have agreed with Gloriani\nany more than you. He used to come and see me very often, and in those\ndays I thought his tunic and his long neck infallible symptoms of\ngenius. His talk was all of gilded aureoles and beatific visions; he\nlived on weak wine and biscuits, and wore a lock of Saint Somebody’s\nhair in a little bag round his neck. If he was not a Beato Angelico, it\nwas not his own fault. I hope with all my heart that Mr. Hudson will do\nthe fine things he talks about, but he must bear in mind the history of\ndear Mr. Schafgans as a warning against high-flown pretensions. One fine\nday this poor young man fell in love with a Roman model, though she\nhad never sat to him, I believe, for she was a buxom, bold-faced,\nhigh-colored creature, and he painted none but pale, sickly women. He\noffered to marry her, and she looked at him from head to foot, gave a\nshrug, and consented. But he was ashamed to set up his menage in Rome.\nThey went to Naples, and there, a couple of years afterwards, I saw him.\nThe poor fellow was ruined. His wife used to beat him, and he had taken\nto drinking. He wore a ragged black coat, and he had a blotchy, red\nface. Madame had turned washerwoman and used to make him go and fetch\nthe dirty linen. His talent had gone heaven knows where! He was getting\nhis living by painting views of Vesuvius in eruption on the little boxes\nthey sell at Sorrento.”\n\n“Moral: don’t fall in love with a buxom Roman model,” said Roderick. “I\n‘m much obliged to you for your story, but I don’t mean to fall in love\nwith any one.”\n\nGloriani had possessed himself of the photograph again, and was looking\nat it curiously. “It ‘s a happy bit of youth,” he said. “But you can’t\nkeep it up--you can’t keep it up!”\n\nThe two sculptors pursued their discussion after dinner, in the\ndrawing-room. Rowland left them to have it out in a corner, where\nRoderick’s Eve stood over them in the shaded lamplight, in vague white\nbeauty, like the guardian angel of the young idealist. Singleton was\nlistening to Madame Grandoni, and Rowland took his place on the sofa,\nnear Miss Blanchard. They had a good deal of familiar, desultory talk.\nEvery now and then Madame Grandoni looked round at them. Miss Blanchard\nat last asked Rowland certain questions about Roderick: who he was,\nwhere he came from, whether it was true, as she had heard, that Rowland\nhad discovered him and brought him out at his own expense. Rowland\nanswered her questions; to the last he gave a vague affirmative.\nFinally, after a pause, looking at him, “You ‘re very generous,” Miss\nBlanchard said. The declaration was made with a certain richness of\ntone, but it brought to Rowland’s sense neither delight nor confusion.\nHe had heard the words before; he suddenly remembered the grave\nsincerity with which Miss Garland had uttered them as he strolled with\nher in the woods the day of Roderick’s picnic. They had pleased him\nthen; now he asked Miss Blanchard whether she would have some tea.\n\nWhen the two ladies withdrew, he attended them to their carriage. Coming\nback to the drawing-room, he paused outside the open door; he was\nstruck by the group formed by the three men. They were standing before\nRoderick’s statue of Eve, and the young sculptor had lifted up the lamp\nand was showing different parts of it to his companions. He was talking\nardently, and the lamplight covered his head and face. Rowland stood\nlooking on, for the group struck him with its picturesque symbolism.\nRoderick, bearing the lamp and glowing in its radiant circle, seemed\nthe beautiful image of a genius which combined sincerity with power.\nGloriani, with his head on one side, pulling his long moustache and\nlooking keenly from half-closed eyes at the lighted marble, represented\nart with a worldly motive, skill unleavened by faith, the mere base\nmaximum of cleverness. Poor little Singleton, on the other side, with\nhis hands behind him, his head thrown back, and his eyes following\ndevoutly the course of Roderick’s elucidation, might pass for an\nembodiment of aspiring candor, with feeble wings to rise on. In all\nthis, Roderick’s was certainly the beau role.\n\nGloriani turned to Rowland as he came up, and pointed back with his\nthumb to the statue, with a smile half sardonic, half good-natured. “A\npretty thing--a devilish pretty thing,” he said. “It ‘s as fresh as the\nfoam in the milk-pail. He can do it once, he can do it twice, he can do\nit at a stretch half a dozen times. But--but--”\n\nHe was returning to his former refrain, but Rowland intercepted him.\n“Oh, he will keep it up,” he said, smiling, “I will answer for him.”\n\nGloriani was not encouraging, but Roderick had listened smiling. He\nwas floating unperturbed on the tide of his deep self-confidence. Now,\nsuddenly, however, he turned with a flash of irritation in his eye, and\ndemanded in a ringing voice, “In a word, then, you prophesy that I am to\nfail?”\n\nGloriani answered imperturbably, patting him kindly on the shoulder. “My\ndear fellow, passion burns out, inspiration runs to seed. Some fine day\nevery artist finds himself sitting face to face with his lump of clay,\nwith his empty canvas, with his sheet of blank paper, waiting in vain\nfor the revelation to be made, for the Muse to descend. He must learn\nto do without the Muse! When the fickle jade forgets the way to your\nstudio, don’t waste any time in tearing your hair and meditating on\nsuicide. Come round and see me, and I will show you how to console\nyourself.”\n\n“If I break down,” said Roderick, passionately, “I shall stay down.\nIf the Muse deserts me, she shall at least have her infidelity on her\nconscience.”\n\n“You have no business,” Rowland said to Gloriani, “to talk lightly of\nthe Muse in this company. Mr. Singleton, too, has received pledges from\nher which place her constancy beyond suspicion.” And he pointed out on\nthe wall, near by, two small landscapes by the modest water-colorist.\n\nThe sculptor examined them with deference, and Singleton himself began\nto laugh nervously; he was trembling with hope that the great\nGloriani would be pleased. “Yes, these are fresh too,” Gloriani said;\n“extraordinarily fresh! How old are you?”\n\n“Twenty-six, sir,” said Singleton.\n\n“For twenty-six they are famously fresh. They must have taken you a long\ntime; you work slowly.”\n\n“Yes, unfortunately, I work very slowly. One of them took me six weeks,\nthe other two months.”\n\n“Upon my word! The Muse pays you long visits.” And Gloriani turned\nand looked, from head to foot, at so unlikely an object of her favors.\nSingleton smiled and began to wipe his forehead very hard. “Oh, you!”\n said the sculptor; “you ‘ll keep it up!”\n\nA week after his dinner-party, Rowland went into Roderick’s studio and\nfound him sitting before an unfinished piece of work, with a hanging\nhead and a heavy eye. He could have fancied that the fatal hour foretold\nby Gloriani had struck. Roderick rose with a sombre yawn and flung down\nhis tools. “It ‘s no use,” he said, “I give it up!”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“I have struck a shallow! I have been sailing bravely, but for the last\nday or two my keel has been crunching the bottom.”\n\n“A difficult place?” Rowland asked, with a sympathetic inflection,\nlooking vaguely at the roughly modeled figure.\n\n“Oh, it ‘s not the poor clay!” Roderick answered. “The difficult place\nis here!” And he struck a blow on his heart. “I don’t know what ‘s the\nmatter with me. Nothing comes; all of a sudden I hate things. My old\nthings look ugly; everything looks stupid.”\n\nRowland was perplexed. He was in the situation of a man who has been\nriding a blood horse at an even, elastic gallop, and of a sudden feels\nhim stumble and balk. As yet, he reflected, he had seen nothing but the\nsunshine of genius; he had forgotten that it has its storms. Of course\nit had! And he felt a flood of comradeship rise in his heart which would\nfloat them both safely through the worst weather. “Why, you ‘re tired!”\n he said. “Of course you ‘re tired. You have a right to be!”\n\n“Do you think I have a right to be?” Roderick asked, looking at him.\n\n“Unquestionably, after all you have done.”\n\n“Well, then, right or wrong, I am tired. I certainly have done a fair\nwinter’s work. I want a change.”\n\nRowland declared that it was certainly high time they should be leaving\nRome. They would go north and travel. They would go to Switzerland, to\nGermany, to Holland, to England. Roderick assented, his eye brightened,\nand Rowland talked of a dozen things they might do. Roderick walked up\nand down; he seemed to have something to say which he hesitated to bring\nout. He hesitated so rarely that Rowland wondered, and at last asked him\nwhat was on his mind. Roderick stopped before him, frowning a little.\n\n“I have such unbounded faith in your good-will,” he said, “that I\nbelieve nothing I can say would offend you.”\n\n“Try it,” said Rowland.\n\n“Well, then, I think my journey will do me more good if I take it alone.\nI need n’t say I prefer your society to that of any man living. For the\nlast six months it has been everything to me. But I have a perpetual\nfeeling that you are expecting something of me, that you are measuring\nmy doings by a terrifically high standard. You are watching me; I don’t\nwant to be watched. I want to go my own way; to work when I choose and\nto loaf when I choose. It is not that I don’t know what I owe you; it\nis not that we are not friends. It is simply that I want a taste of\nabsolutely unrestricted freedom. Therefore, I say, let us separate.”\n\nRowland shook him by the hand. “Willingly. Do as you desire, I shall\nmiss you, and I venture to believe you ‘ll pass some lonely hours. But I\nhave only one request to make: that if you get into trouble of any kind\nwhatever, you will immediately let me know.”\n\nThey began their journey, however, together, and crossed the Alps\nside by side, muffled in one rug, on the top of the St. Gothard coach.\nRowland was going to England to pay some promised visits; his companion\nhad no plan save to ramble through Switzerland and Germany as fancy\nguided him. He had money, now, that would outlast the summer; when\nit was spent he would come back to Rome and make another statue. At\na little mountain village by the way, Roderick declared that he would\nstop; he would scramble about a little in the high places and doze in\nthe shade of the pine forests. The coach was changing horses; the two\nyoung men walked along the village street, picking their way between\ndunghills, breathing the light, cool air, and listening to the plash of\nthe fountain and the tinkle of cattle-bells. The coach overtook them,\nand then Rowland, as he prepared to mount, felt an almost overmastering\nreluctance.\n\n“Say the word,” he exclaimed, “and I will stop too.”\n\nRoderick frowned. “Ah, you don’t trust me; you don’t think I ‘m able\nto take care of myself. That proves that I was right in feeling as if I\nwere watched!”\n\n“Watched, my dear fellow!” said Rowland. “I hope you may never have\nanything worse to complain of than being watched in the spirit in which\nI watch you. But I will spare you even that. Good-by!” Standing in his\nplace, as the coach rolled away, he looked back at his friend lingering\nby the roadside. A great snow-mountain, behind Roderick, was beginning\nto turn pink in the sunset. The young man waved his hat, still looking\ngrave. Rowland settled himself in his place, reflecting after all that\nthis was a salubrious beginning of independence. He was among forests\nand glaciers, leaning on the pure bosom of nature. And then--and\nthen--was it not in itself a guarantee against folly to be engaged to\nMary Garland?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Experience\n\nRowland passed the summer in England, staying with several old friends\nand two or three new ones. On his arrival, he felt it on his conscience\nto write to Mrs. Hudson and inform her that her son had relieved him of\nhis tutelage. He felt that she considered him an incorruptible Mentor,\nfollowing Roderick like a shadow, and he wished to let her know the\ntruth. But he made the truth very comfortable, and gave a succinct\nstatement of the young man’s brilliant beginnings. He owed it to\nhimself, he said, to remind her that he had not judged lightly, and that\nRoderick’s present achievements were more profitable than his inglorious\ndrudgery at Messrs. Striker & Spooner’s. He was now taking a well-earned\nholiday and proposing to see a little of the world. He would work none\nthe worse for this; every artist needed to knock about and look at\nthings for himself. They had parted company for a couple of months, for\nRoderick was now a great man and beyond the need of going about with a\nkeeper. But they were to meet again in Rome in the autumn, and then he\nshould be able to send her more good news. Meanwhile, he was very happy\nin what Roderick had already done--especially happy in the happiness it\nmust have brought to her. He ventured to ask to be kindly commended to\nMiss Garland.\n\nHis letter was promptly answered--to his surprise in Miss Garland’s own\nhand. The same mail brought also an epistle from Cecilia. The latter was\nvoluminous, and we must content ourselves with giving an extract.\n\n“Your letter was filled with an echo of that brilliant Roman world,\nwhich made me almost ill with envy. For a week after I got it I thought\nNorthampton really unpardonably tame. But I am drifting back again to my\nold deeps of resignation, and I rush to the window, when any one passes,\nwith all my old gratitude for small favors. So Roderick Hudson is\nalready a great man, and you turn out to be a great prophet? My\ncompliments to both of you; I never heard of anything working so\nsmoothly. And he takes it all very quietly, and does n’t lose his\nbalance nor let it turn his head? You judged him, then, in a day better\nthan I had done in six months, for I really did not expect that he would\nsettle down into such a jog-trot of prosperity. I believed he would do\nfine things, but I was sure he would intersperse them with a good many\nfollies, and that his beautiful statues would spring up out of the midst\nof a straggling plantation of wild oats. But from what you tell me, Mr.\nStriker may now go hang himself..... There is one thing, however, to say\nas a friend, in the way of warning. That candid soul can keep a secret,\nand he may have private designs on your equanimity which you don’t begin\nto suspect. What do you think of his being engaged to Miss Garland? The\ntwo ladies had given no hint of it all winter, but a fortnight ago, when\nthose big photographs of his statues arrived, they first pinned them up\non the wall, and then trotted out into the town, made a dozen calls, and\nannounced the news. Mrs. Hudson did, at least; Miss Garland, I suppose,\nsat at home writing letters. To me, I confess, the thing was a perfect\nsurprise. I had not a suspicion that all the while he was coming so\nregularly to make himself agreeable on my veranda, he was quietly\npreferring his cousin to any one else. Not, indeed, that he was ever at\nparticular pains to make himself agreeable! I suppose he has picked up\na few graces in Rome. But he must not acquire too many: if he is too\npolite when he comes back, Miss Garland will count him as one of the\nlost. She will be a very good wife for a man of genius, and such a one\nas they are often shrewd enough to take. She ‘ll darn his stockings and\nkeep his accounts, and sit at home and trim the lamp and keep up\nthe fire while he studies the Beautiful in pretty neighbors at\ndinner-parties. The two ladies are evidently very happy, and, to do them\njustice, very humbly grateful to you. Mrs. Hudson never speaks of you\nwithout tears in her eyes, and I am sure she considers you a specially\npatented agent of Providence. Verily, it ‘s a good thing for a woman to\nbe in love: Miss Garland has grown almost pretty. I met her the other\nnight at a tea-party; she had a white rose in her hair, and sang a\nsentimental ballad in a fine contralto voice.”\n\nMiss Garland’s letter was so much shorter that we may give it entire:--\n\nMy dear Sir,--Mrs. Hudson, as I suppose you know, has been for some time\nunable to use her eyes. She requests me, therefore, to answer your favor\nof the 22d of June. She thanks you extremely for writing, and wishes me\nto say that she considers herself in every way under great obligations\nto you. Your account of her son’s progress and the high estimation in\nwhich he is held has made her very happy, and she earnestly prays that\nall may continue well with him. He sent us, a short time ago, several\nlarge photographs of his two statues, taken from different points of\nview. We know little about such things, but they seem to us wonderfully\nbeautiful. We sent them to Boston to be handsomely framed, and the man,\non returning them, wrote us that he had exhibited them for a week in\nhis store, and that they had attracted great attention. The frames are\nmagnificent, and the pictures now hang in a row on the parlor wall.\nOur only quarrel with them is that they make the old papering and the\nengravings look dreadfully shabby. Mr. Striker stood and looked at them\nthe other day full five minutes, and said, at last, that if Roderick’s\nhead was running on such things it was no wonder he could not learn to\ndraw up a deed. We lead here so quiet and monotonous a life that I\nam afraid I can tell you nothing that will interest you. Mrs. Hudson\nrequests me to say that the little more or less that may happen to us is\nof small account, as we live in our thoughts and our thoughts are fixed\non her dear son. She thanks Heaven he has so good a friend. Mrs. Hudson\nsays that this is too short a letter, but I can say nothing more.\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nMary Garland.\n\nIt is a question whether the reader will know why, but this letter\ngave Rowland extraordinary pleasure. He liked its very brevity and\nmeagreness, and there seemed to him an exquisite modesty in its saying\nnothing from the young girl herself. He delighted in the formal address\nand conclusion; they pleased him as he had been pleased by an angular\ngesture in some expressive girlish figure in an early painting. The\nletter renewed that impression of strong feeling combined with an almost\nrigid simplicity, which Roderick’s betrothed had personally given\nhim. And its homely stiffness seemed a vivid reflection of a life\nconcentrated, as the young girl had borrowed warrant from her companion\nto say, in a single devoted idea. The monotonous days of the two women\nseemed to Rowland’s fancy to follow each other like the tick-tick of a\ngreat time-piece, marking off the hours which separated them from the\nsupreme felicity of clasping the far-away son and lover to lips sealed\nwith the excess of joy. He hoped that Roderick, now that he had shaken\noff the oppression of his own importunate faith, was not losing a\ntolerant temper for the silent prayers of the two women at Northampton.\n\nHe was left to vain conjectures, however, as to Roderick’s actual moods\nand occupations. He knew he was no letter-writer, and that, in the young\nsculptor’s own phrase, he had at any time rather build a monument than\nwrite a note. But when a month had passed without news of him, he began\nto be half anxious and half angry, and wrote him three lines, in the\ncare of a Continental banker, begging him at least to give some sign of\nwhether he was alive or dead. A week afterwards came an answer--brief,\nand dated Baden-Baden. “I know I have been a great brute,” Roderick\nwrote, “not to have sent you a word before; but really I don’t know what\nhas got into me. I have lately learned terribly well how to be idle. I\nam afraid to think how long it is since I wrote to my mother or to Mary.\nHeaven help them--poor, patient, trustful creatures! I don’t know how to\ntell you what I am doing. It seems all amusing enough while I do it, but\nit would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable\neyes. I found Baxter in Switzerland, or rather he found me, and he\ngrabbed me by the arm and brought me here. I was walking twenty miles a\nday in the Alps, drinking milk in lonely chalets, sleeping as you sleep,\nand thinking it was all very good fun; but Baxter told me it would never\ndo, that the Alps were ‘d----d rot,’ that Baden-Baden was the place, and\nthat if I knew what was good for me I would come along with him. It is a\nwonderful place, certainly, though, thank the Lord, Baxter departed last\nweek, blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante. But you know all about\nit and what one does--what one is liable to do. I have succumbed, in a\nmeasure, to the liabilities, and I wish I had some one here to give me a\nthundering good blowing up. Not you, dear friend; you would draw it too\nmild; you have too much of the milk of human kindness. I have fits of\nhorrible homesickness for my studio, and I shall be devoutly grateful\nwhen the summer is over and I can go back and swing a chisel. I feel as\nif nothing but the chisel would satisfy me; as if I could rush in a rage\nat a block of unshaped marble. There are a lot of the Roman people here,\nEnglish and American; I live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from\nmorning till night. There is also some one else; and to her I don’t talk\nsense, nor, thank heaven, mean what I say. I confess, I need a month’s\nwork to recover my self-respect.”\n\nThese lines brought Rowland no small perturbation; the more, that what\nthey seemed to point to surprised him. During the nine months of their\ncompanionship Roderick had shown so little taste for dissipation that\nRowland had come to think of it as a canceled danger, and it greatly\nperplexed him to learn that his friend had apparently proved so pliant\nto opportunity. But Roderick’s allusions were ambiguous, and it was\npossible they might simply mean that he was out of patience with a\nfrivolous way of life and fretting wholesomely over his absent work.\nIt was a very good thing, certainly, that idleness should prove, on\nexperiment, to sit heavily on his conscience. Nevertheless, the letter\nneeded, to Rowland’s mind, a key: the key arrived a week later. “In\ncommon charity,” Roderick wrote, “lend me a hundred pounds! I have\ngambled away my last franc--I have made a mountain of debts. Send me the\nmoney first; lecture me afterwards!” Rowland sent the money by return of\nmail; then he proceeded, not to lecture, but to think. He hung his head;\nhe was acutely disappointed. He had no right to be, he assured himself;\nbut so it was. Roderick was young, impulsive, unpracticed in stoicism;\nit was a hundred to one that he was to pay the usual vulgar tribute\nto folly. But his friend had regarded it as securely gained to his own\nbelief in virtue that he was not as other foolish youths are, and that\nhe would have been capable of looking at folly in the face and passing\non his way. Rowland for a while felt a sore sense of wrath. What right\nhad a man who was engaged to that fine girl in Northampton to behave\nas if his consciousness were a common blank, to be overlaid with coarse\nsensations? Yes, distinctly, he was disappointed. He had accompanied his\nmissive with an urgent recommendation to leave Baden-Baden immediately,\nand an offer to meet Roderick at any point he would name. The answer\ncame promptly; it ran as follows: “Send me another fifty pounds! I have\nbeen back to the tables. I will leave as soon as the money comes, and\nmeet you at Geneva. There I will tell you everything.”\n\nThere is an ancient terrace at Geneva, planted with trees and studded\nwith benches, overlooked by gravely aristocratic old dwellings and\noverlooking the distant Alps. A great many generations have made it a\nlounging-place, a great many friends and lovers strolled there, a great\nmany confidential talks and momentous interviews gone forward. Here, one\nmorning, sitting on one of the battered green benches, Roderick, as he\nhad promised, told his friend everything. He had arrived late the\nnight before; he looked tired, and yet flushed and excited. He made no\nprofessions of penitence, but he practiced an unmitigated frankness,\nand his self-reprobation might be taken for granted. He implied in every\nphrase that he had done with it all, and that he was counting the hours\ntill he could get back to work. We shall not rehearse his confession in\ndetail; its main outline will be sufficient. He had fallen in with some\nvery idle people, and had discovered that a little example and a little\npractice were capable of producing on his own part a considerable relish\nfor their diversions. What could he do? He never read, and he had no\nstudio; in one way or another he had to pass the time. He passed it in\ndangling about several very pretty women in wonderful Paris toilets,\nand reflected that it was always something gained for a sculptor to sit\nunder a tree, looking at his leisure into a charming face and saying\nthings that made it smile and play its muscles and part its lips and\nshow its teeth. Attached to these ladies were certain gentlemen who\nwalked about in clouds of perfume, rose at midday, and supped at\nmidnight. Roderick had found himself in the mood for thinking them very\namusing fellows. He was surprised at his own taste, but he let it take\nits course. It led him to the discovery that to live with ladies who\nexpect you to present them with expensive bouquets, to ride with them in\nthe Black Forest on well-looking horses, to come into their opera-boxes\non nights when Patti sang and prices were consequent, to propose little\nlight suppers at the Conversation House after the opera or drives by\nmoonlight to the Castle, to be always arrayed and anointed, trinketed\nand gloved,--that to move in such society, we say, though it might be a\nprivilege, was a privilege with a penalty attached. But the tables made\nsuch things easy; half the Baden world lived by the tables. Roderick\ntried them and found that at first they smoothed his path delightfully.\nThis simplification of matters, however, was only momentary, for he soon\nperceived that to seem to have money, and to have it in fact, exposed\na good-looking young man to peculiar liabilities. At this point of his\nfriend’s narrative, Rowland was reminded of Madame de Cruchecassee in\nThe Newcomes, and though he had listened in tranquil silence to the rest\nof it, he found it hard not to say that all this had been, under\nthe circumstances, a very bad business. Roderick admitted it with\nbitterness, and then told how much--measured simply financially--it had\ncost him. His luck had changed; the tables had ceased to back him, and\nhe had found himself up to his knees in debt. Every penny had gone\nof the solid sum which had seemed a large equivalent of those shining\nstatues in Rome. He had been an ass, but it was not irreparable; he\ncould make another statue in a couple of months.\n\nRowland frowned. “For heaven’s sake,” he said, “don’t play such\ndangerous games with your facility. If you have got facility, revere\nit, respect it, adore it, treasure it--don’t speculate on it.” And he\nwondered what his companion, up to his knees in debt, would have done\nif there had been no good-natured Rowland Mallet to lend a helping hand.\nBut he did not formulate his curiosity audibly, and the contingency\nseemed not to have presented itself to Roderick’s imagination. The young\nsculptor reverted to his late adventures again in the evening, and this\ntime talked of them more objectively, as the phrase is; more as if they\nhad been the adventures of another person. He related half a dozen droll\nthings that had happened to him, and, as if his responsibility had been\ndisengaged by all this free discussion, he laughed extravagantly at the\nmemory of them. Rowland sat perfectly grave, on principle. Then Roderick\nbegan to talk of half a dozen statues that he had in his head, and\nset forth his design, with his usual vividness. Suddenly, as it was\nrelevant, he declared that his Baden doings had not been altogether\nfruitless, for that the lady who had reminded Rowland of Madame de\nCruchecassee was tremendously statuesque. Rowland at last said that it\nall might pass if he felt that he was really the wiser for it. “By the\nwiser,” he added, “I mean the stronger in purpose, in will.”\n\n“Oh, don’t talk about will!” Roderick answered, throwing back his head\nand looking at the stars. This conversation also took place in the open\nair, on the little island in the shooting Rhone where Jean-Jacques has\na monument. “The will, I believe, is the mystery of mysteries. Who can\nanswer for his will? who can say beforehand that it ‘s strong? There are\nall kinds of indefinable currents moving to and fro between one’s\nwill and one’s inclinations. People talk as if the two things were\nessentially distinct; on different sides of one’s organism, like the\nheart and the liver. Mine, I know, are much nearer together. It all\ndepends upon circumstances. I believe there is a certain group of\ncircumstances possible for every man, in which his will is destined to\nsnap like a dry twig.”\n\n“My dear boy,” said Rowland, “don’t talk about the will being\n‘destined.’ The will is destiny itself. That ‘s the way to look at it.”\n\n“Look at it, my dear Rowland,” Roderick answered, “as you find\nmost comfortable. One conviction I have gathered from my summer’s\nexperience,” he went on--“it ‘s as well to look it frankly in the\nface--is that I possess an almost unlimited susceptibility to the\ninfluence of a beautiful woman.”\n\nRowland stared, then strolled away, softly whistling to himself. He\nwas unwilling to admit even to himself that this speech had really the\nsinister meaning it seemed to have. In a few days the two young men made\ntheir way back to Italy, and lingered a while in Florence before\ngoing on to Rome. In Florence Roderick seemed to have won back his old\ninnocence and his preference for the pleasures of study over any others.\nRowland began to think of the Baden episode as a bad dream, or at\nthe worst as a mere sporadic piece of disorder, without roots in his\ncompanion’s character. They passed a fortnight looking at pictures\nand exploring for out the way bits of fresco and carving, and Roderick\nrecovered all his earlier fervor of appreciation and comment. In Rome he\nwent eagerly to work again, and finished in a month two or three small\nthings he had left standing on his departure. He talked the most joyous\nnonsense about finding himself back in his old quarters. On the first\nSunday afternoon following their return, on their going together to\nSaint Peter’s, he delivered himself of a lyrical greeting to the great\nchurch and to the city in general, in a tone of voice so irrepressibly\nelevated that it rang through the nave in rather a scandalous fashion,\nand almost arrested a procession of canons who were marching across to\nthe choir. He began to model a new statue--a female figure, of which he\nhad said nothing to Rowland. It represented a woman, leaning lazily back\nin her chair, with her head drooping as if she were listening, a vague\nsmile on her lips, and a pair of remarkably beautiful arms folded in her\nlap. With rather less softness of contour, it would have resembled the\nnoble statue of Agrippina in the Capitol. Rowland looked at it and was\nnot sure he liked it. “Who is it? what does it mean?” he asked.\n\n“Anything you please!” said Roderick, with a certain petulance. “I call\nit A Reminiscence.”\n\nRowland then remembered that one of the Baden ladies had been\n“statuesque,” and asked no more questions. This, after all, was a way of\nprofiting by experience. A few days later he took his first ride of\nthe season on the Campagna, and as, on his homeward way, he was passing\nacross the long shadow of a ruined tower, he perceived a small figure\nat a short distance, bent over a sketch-book. As he drew near, he\nrecognized his friend Singleton. The honest little painter’s face was\nscorched to flame-color by the light of southern suns, and borrowed an\neven deeper crimson from his gleeful greeting of his most appreciative\npatron. He was making a careful and charming little sketch. On Rowland’s\nasking him how he had spent his summer, he gave an account of his\nwanderings which made poor Mallet sigh with a sense of more contrasts\nthan one. He had not been out of Italy, but he had been delving deep\ninto the picturesque heart of the lovely land, and gathering a wonderful\nstore of subjects. He had rambled about among the unvisited villages of\nthe Apennines, pencil in hand and knapsack on back, sleeping on straw\nand eating black bread and beans, but feasting on local color, rioting,\nas it were, on chiaroscuro, and laying up a treasure of pictorial\nobservations. He took a devout satisfaction in his hard-earned wisdom\nand his happy frugality. Rowland went the next day, by appointment,\nto look at his sketches, and spent a whole morning turning them over.\nSingleton talked more than he had ever done before, explained them all,\nand told some quaintly humorous anecdote about the production of each.\n\n“Dear me, how I have chattered!” he said at last. “I am afraid you had\nrather have looked at the things in peace and quiet. I did n’t know I\ncould talk so much. But somehow, I feel very happy; I feel as if I had\nimproved.”\n\n“That you have,” said Rowland. “I doubt whether an artist ever passed a\nmore profitable three months. You must feel much more sure of yourself.”\n\nSingleton looked for a long time with great intentness at a knot in the\nfloor. “Yes,” he said at last, in a fluttered tone, “I feel much more\nsure of myself. I have got more facility!” And he lowered his voice as\nif he were communicating a secret which it took some courage to impart.\n“I hardly like to say it, for fear I should after all be mistaken. But\nsince it strikes you, perhaps it ‘s true. It ‘s a great happiness; I\nwould not exchange it for a great deal of money.”\n\n“Yes, I suppose it ‘s a great happiness,” said Rowland. “I shall really\nthink of you as living here in a state of scandalous bliss. I don’t\nbelieve it ‘s good for an artist to be in such brutally high spirits.”\n\nSingleton stared for a moment, as if he thought Rowland was in earnest;\nthen suddenly fathoming the kindly jest, he walked about the room,\nscratching his head and laughing intensely to himself. “And Mr. Hudson?”\n he said, as Rowland was going; “I hope he is well and happy.”\n\n“He is very well,” said Rowland. “He is back at work again.”\n\n“Ah, there ‘s a man,” cried Singleton, “who has taken his start once\nfor all, and does n’t need to stop and ask himself in fear and trembling\nevery month or two whether he is advancing or not. When he stops, it ‘s\nto rest! And where did he spend his summer?”\n\n“The greater part of it at Baden-Baden.”\n\n“Ah, that ‘s in the Black Forest,” cried Singleton, with profound\nsimplicity. “They say you can make capital studies of trees there.”\n\n“No doubt,” said Rowland, with a smile, laying an almost paternal\nhand on the little painter’s yellow head. “Unfortunately trees are not\nRoderick’s line. Nevertheless, he tells me that at Baden he made some\nstudies. Come when you can, by the way,” he added after a moment,\n“to his studio, and tell me what you think of something he has lately\nbegun.” Singleton declared that he would come delightedly, and Rowland\nleft him to his work.\n\nHe met a number of his last winter’s friends again, and called upon\nMadame Grandoni, upon Miss Blanchard, and upon Gloriani, shortly after\ntheir return. The ladies gave an excellent account of themselves.\nMadame Grandoni had been taking sea-baths at Rimini, and Miss Blanchard\npainting wild flowers in the Tyrol. Her complexion was somewhat browned,\nwhich was very becoming, and her flowers were uncommonly pretty.\nGloriani had been in Paris and had come away in high good-humor, finding\nno one there, in the artist-world, cleverer than himself. He came in a\nfew days to Roderick’s studio, one afternoon when Rowland was present.\nHe examined the new statue with great deference, said it was very\npromising, and abstained, considerately, from irritating prophecies. But\nRowland fancied he observed certain signs of inward jubilation on the\nclever sculptor’s part, and walked away with him to learn his private\nopinion.\n\n“Certainly; I liked it as well as I said,” Gloriani declared in answer\nto Rowland’s anxious query; “or rather I liked it a great deal better. I\ndid n’t say how much, for fear of making your friend angry. But one can\nleave him alone now, for he ‘s coming round. I told you he could n’t\nkeep up the transcendental style, and he has already broken down. Don’t\nyou see it yourself, man?”\n\n“I don’t particularly like this new statue,” said Rowland.\n\n“That ‘s because you ‘re a purist. It ‘s deuced clever, it ‘s deuced\nknowing, it ‘s deuced pretty, but it is n’t the topping high art of\nthree months ago. He has taken his turn sooner than I supposed. What has\nhappened to him? Has he been disappointed in love? But that ‘s none of\nmy business. I congratulate him on having become a practical man.”\n\nRoderick, however, was less to be congratulated than Gloriani had taken\nit into his head to believe. He was discontented with his work, he\napplied himself to it by fits and starts, he declared that he did n’t\nknow what was coming over him; he was turning into a man of moods. “Is\nthis of necessity what a fellow must come to”--he asked of Rowland, with\na sort of peremptory flash in his eye, which seemed to imply that his\ncompanion had undertaken to insure him against perplexities and was not\nfulfilling his contract--“this damnable uncertainty when he goes to bed\nat night as to whether he is going to wake up in a working humor or in a\nswearing humor? Have we only a season, over before we know it, in which\nwe can call our faculties our own? Six months ago I could stand up to my\nwork like a man, day after day, and never dream of asking myself whether\nI felt like it. But now, some mornings, it ‘s the very devil to get\ngoing. My statue looks so bad when I come into the studio that I have\ntwenty minds to smash it on the spot, and I lose three or four hours in\nsitting there, moping and getting used to it.”\n\nRowland said that he supposed that this sort of thing was the lot of\nevery artist and that the only remedy was plenty of courage and faith.\nAnd he reminded him of Gloriani’s having forewarned him against these\nsterile moods the year before.\n\n“Gloriani ‘s an ass!” said Roderick, almost fiercely. He hired a horse\nand began to ride with Rowland on the Campagna. This delicious amusement\nrestored him in a measure to cheerfulness, but seemed to Rowland on the\nwhole not to stimulate his industry. Their rides were always very\nlong, and Roderick insisted on making them longer by dismounting in\npicturesque spots and stretching himself in the sun among a heap of\novertangled stones. He let the scorching Roman luminary beat down upon\nhim with an equanimity which Rowland found it hard to emulate. But in\nthis situation Roderick talked so much amusing nonsense that, for the\nsake of his company, Rowland consented to be uncomfortable, and often\nforgot that, though in these diversions the days passed quickly, they\nbrought forth neither high art nor low. And yet it was perhaps by their\nhelp, after all, that Roderick secured several mornings of ardent work\non his new figure, and brought it to rapid completion. One afternoon,\nwhen it was finished, Rowland went to look at it, and Roderick asked him\nfor his opinion.\n\n“What do you think yourself?” Rowland demanded, not from pusillanimity,\nbut from real uncertainty.\n\n“I think it is curiously bad,” Roderick answered. “It was bad from the\nfirst; it has fundamental vices. I have shuffled them in a measure out\nof sight, but I have not corrected them. I can’t--I can’t--I can’t!” he\ncried passionately. “They stare me in the face--they are all I see!”\n\nRowland offered several criticisms of detail, and suggested certain\npracticable changes. But Roderick differed with him on each of these\npoints; the thing had faults enough, but they were not those faults.\nRowland, unruffled, concluded by saying that whatever its faults might\nbe, he had an idea people in general would like it.\n\n“I wish to heaven some person in particular would buy it, and take it\noff my hands and out of my sight!” Roderick cried. “What am I to do\nnow?” he went on. “I have n’t an idea. I think of subjects, but they\nremain mere lifeless names. They are mere words--they are not images.\nWhat am I to do?”\n\nRowland was a trifle annoyed. “Be a man,” he was on the point of saying,\n“and don’t, for heaven’s sake, talk in that confoundedly querulous\nvoice.” But before he had uttered the words, there rang through the\nstudio a loud, peremptory ring at the outer door.\n\nRoderick broke into a laugh. “Talk of the devil,” he said, “and you see\nhis horns! If that ‘s not a customer, it ought to be.”\n\nThe door of the studio was promptly flung open, and a lady advanced to\nthe threshold--an imposing, voluminous person, who quite filled up the\ndoorway. Rowland immediately felt that he had seen her before, but he\nrecognized her only when she moved forward and disclosed an attendant in\nthe person of a little bright-eyed, elderly gentleman, with a bristling\nwhite moustache. Then he remembered that just a year before he and his\ncompanion had seen in the Ludovisi gardens a wonderfully beautiful girl,\nstrolling in the train of this conspicuous couple. He looked for her\nnow, and in a moment she appeared, following her companions with the\nsame nonchalant step as before, and leading her great snow-white poodle,\ndecorated with motley ribbons. The elder lady offered the two young\nmen a sufficiently gracious salute; the little old gentleman bowed and\nsmiled with extreme alertness. The young girl, without casting a glance\neither at Roderick or at Rowland, looked about for a chair, and, on\nperceiving one, sank into it listlessly, pulled her poodle towards her,\nand began to rearrange his top-knot. Rowland saw that, even with her\neyes dropped, her beauty was still dazzling.\n\n“I trust we are at liberty to enter,” said the elder lady, with majesty.\n“We were told that Mr. Hudson had no fixed day, and that we might come\nat any time. Let us not disturb you.”\n\nRoderick, as one of the lesser lights of the Roman art-world, had not\nhitherto been subject to incursions from inquisitive tourists, and,\nhaving no regular reception day, was not versed in the usual formulas of\nwelcome. He said nothing, and Rowland, looking at him, saw that he was\nlooking amazedly at the young girl and was apparently unconscious of\neverything else. “By Jove!” he cried precipitately, “it ‘s that goddess\nof the Villa Ludovisi!” Rowland in some confusion, did the honors as he\ncould, but the little old gentleman begged him with the most obsequious\nof smiles to give himself no trouble. “I have been in many a studio!” he\nsaid, with his finger on his nose and a strong Italian accent.\n\n“We are going about everywhere,” said his companion. “I am passionately\nfond of art!”\n\nRowland smiled sympathetically, and let them turn to Roderick’s statue.\nHe glanced again at the young sculptor, to invite him to bestir himself,\nbut Roderick was still gazing wide-eyed at the beautiful young mistress\nof the poodle, who by this time had looked up and was gazing straight at\nhim. There was nothing bold in her look; it expressed a kind of languid,\nimperturbable indifference. Her beauty was extraordinary; it grew and\ngrew as the young man observed her. In such a face the maidenly custom\nof averted eyes and ready blushes would have seemed an anomaly; nature\nhad produced it for man’s delight and meant that it should surrender\nitself freely and coldly to admiration. It was not immediately apparent,\nhowever, that the young lady found an answering entertainment in the\nphysiognomy of her host; she turned her head after a moment and looked\nidly round the room, and at last let her eyes rest on the statue of the\nwoman seated. It being left to Rowland to stimulate conversation, he\nbegan by complimenting her on the beauty of her dog.\n\n“Yes, he ‘s very handsome,” she murmured. “He ‘s a Florentine. The dogs\nin Florence are handsomer than the people.” And on Rowland’s caressing\nhim: “His name is Stenterello,” she added. “Stenterello, give your hand\nto the gentleman.” This order was given in Italian. “Say buon giorno a\nlei.”\n\nStenterello thrust out his paw and gave four short, shrill barks; upon\nwhich the elder lady turned round and raised her forefinger.\n\n“My dear, my dear, remember where you are! Excuse my foolish child,” she\nadded, turning to Roderick with an agreeable smile. “She can think of\nnothing but her poodle.”\n\n“I am teaching him to talk for me,” the young girl went on, without\nheeding her mother; “to say little things in society. It will save me\na great deal of trouble. Stenterello, love, give a pretty smile and say\ntanti complimenti!” The poodle wagged his white pate--it looked like\none of those little pads in swan’s-down, for applying powder to the\nface--and repeated the barking process.\n\n“He is a wonderful beast,” said Rowland.\n\n“He is not a beast,” said the young girl. “A beast is something black\nand dirty--something you can’t touch.”\n\n“He is a very valuable dog,” the elder lady explained. “He was presented\nto my daughter by a Florentine nobleman.”\n\n“It is not for that I care about him. It is for himself. He is better\nthan the prince.”\n\n“My dear, my dear!” repeated the mother in deprecating accents, but with\na significant glance at Rowland which seemed to bespeak his attention to\nthe glory of possessing a daughter who could deal in that fashion with\nthe aristocracy.\n\nRowland remembered that when their unknown visitors had passed before\nthem, a year previous, in the Villa Ludovisi, Roderick and he had\nexchanged conjectures as to their nationality and social quality.\nRoderick had declared that they were old-world people; but Rowland\nnow needed no telling to feel that he might claim the elder lady as a\nfellow-countrywoman. She was a person of what is called a great deal\nof presence, with the faded traces, artfully revived here and there, of\nonce brilliant beauty. Her daughter had come lawfully by her loveliness,\nbut Rowland mentally made the distinction that the mother was silly and\nthat the daughter was not. The mother had a very silly mouth--a mouth,\nRowland suspected, capable of expressing an inordinate degree of\nunreason. The young girl, in spite of her childish satisfaction in her\npoodle, was not a person of feeble understanding. Rowland received an\nimpression that, for reasons of her own, she was playing a part. What\nwas the part and what were her reasons? She was interesting; Rowland\nwondered what were her domestic secrets. If her mother was a daughter\nof the great Republic, it was to be supposed that the young girl was a\nflower of the American soil; but her beauty had a robustness and tone\nuncommon in the somewhat facile loveliness of our western maidenhood.\nShe spoke with a vague foreign accent, as if she had spent her life in\nstrange countries. The little Italian apparently divined Rowland’s mute\nimaginings, for he presently stepped forward, with a bow like a master\nof ceremonies. “I have not done my duty,” he said, “in not announcing\nthese ladies. Mrs. Light, Miss Light!”\n\nRowland was not materially the wiser for this information, but Roderick\nwas aroused by it to the exercise of some slight hospitality. He altered\nthe light, pulled forward two or three figures, and made an apology\nfor not having more to show. “I don’t pretend to have anything of an\nexhibition--I am only a novice.”\n\n“Indeed?--a novice! For a novice this is very well,” Mrs. Light\ndeclared. “Cavaliere, we have seen nothing better than this.”\n\nThe Cavaliere smiled rapturously. “It is stupendous!” he murmured. “And\nwe have been to all the studios.”\n\n“Not to all--heaven forbid!” cried Mrs. Light. “But to a number that I\nhave had pointed out by artistic friends. I delight in studios: they are\nthe temples of the beautiful here below. And if you are a novice, Mr.\nHudson,” she went on, “you have already great admirers. Half a dozen\npeople have told us that yours were among the things to see.” This\ngracious speech went unanswered; Roderick had already wandered across to\nthe other side of the studio and was revolving about Miss Light. “Ah, he\n‘s gone to look at my beautiful daughter; he is not the first that\nhas had his head turned,” Mrs. Light resumed, lowering her voice to\na confidential undertone; a favor which, considering the shortness of\ntheir acquaintance, Rowland was bound to appreciate. “The artists are\nall crazy about her. When she goes into a studio she is fatal to the\npictures. And when she goes into a ball-room what do the other women\nsay? Eh, Cavaliere?”\n\n“She is very beautiful,” Rowland said, gravely.\n\nMrs. Light, who through her long, gold-cased glass was looking a little\nat everything, and at nothing as if she saw it, interrupted her random\nmurmurs and exclamations, and surveyed Rowland from head to foot. She\nlooked at him all over; apparently he had not been mentioned to her as\na feature of Roderick’s establishment. It was the gaze, Rowland felt,\nwhich the vigilant and ambitious mamma of a beautiful daughter has\nalways at her command for well-dressed young men of candid physiognomy.\nHer inspection in this case seemed satisfactory. “Are you also an\nartist?” she inquired with an almost caressing inflection. It was clear\nthat what she meant was something of this kind: “Be so good as to assure\nme without delay that you are really the young man of substance and\namiability that you appear.”\n\nBut Rowland answered simply the formal question--not the latent one.\n“Dear me, no; I am only a friend of Mr. Hudson.”\n\nMrs. Light, with a sigh, returned to the statues, and after mistaking\nthe Adam for a gladiator, and the Eve for a Pocahontas, declared that\nshe could not judge of such things unless she saw them in the marble.\nRowland hesitated a moment, and then speaking in the interest of\nRoderick’s renown, said that he was the happy possessor of several of\nhis friend’s works and that she was welcome to come and see them at his\nrooms. She bade the Cavaliere make a note of his address. “Ah, you ‘re\na patron of the arts,” she said. “That ‘s what I should like to be if\nI had a little money. I delight in beauty in every form. But all these\npeople ask such monstrous prices. One must be a millionaire, to think\nof such things, eh? Twenty years ago my husband had my portrait painted,\nhere in Rome, by Papucci, who was the great man in those days. I was in\na ball dress, with all my jewels, my neck and arms, and all that. The\nman got six hundred francs, and thought he was very well treated. Those\nwere the days when a family could live like princes in Italy for five\nthousand scudi a year. The Cavaliere once upon a time was a great\ndandy--don’t blush, Cavaliere; any one can see that, just as any one can\nsee that I was once a pretty woman! Get him to tell you what he made a\nfigure upon. The railroads have brought in the vulgarians. That ‘s what\nI call it now--the invasion of the vulgarians! What are poor we to do?”\n\nRowland had begun to murmur some remedial proposition, when he was\ninterrupted by the voice of Miss Light calling across the room, “Mamma!”\n\n“My own love?”\n\n“This gentleman wishes to model my bust. Please speak to him.”\n\nThe Cavaliere gave a little chuckle. “Already?” he cried.\n\nRowland looked round, equally surprised at the promptitude of the\nproposal. Roderick stood planted before the young girl with his arms\nfolded, looking at her as he would have done at the Medicean Venus. He\nnever paid compliments, and Rowland, though he had not heard him speak,\ncould imagine the startling distinctness with which he made his request.\n\n“He saw me a year ago,” the young girl went on, “and he has been\nthinking of me ever since.” Her tone, in speaking, was peculiar; it had\na kind of studied inexpressiveness, which was yet not the vulgar device\nof a drawl.\n\n“I must make your daughter’s bust--that ‘s all, madame!” cried Roderick,\nwith warmth.\n\n“I had rather you made the poodle’s,” said the young girl. “Is it very\ntiresome? I have spent half my life sitting for my photograph, in every\nconceivable attitude and with every conceivable coiffure. I think I have\nposed enough.”\n\n“My dear child,” said Mrs. Light, “it may be one’s duty to pose. But as\nto my daughter’s sitting to you, sir--to a young sculptor whom we don’t\nknow--it is a matter that needs reflection. It is not a favor that ‘s to\nbe had for the mere asking.”\n\n“If I don’t make her from life,” said Roderick, with energy, “I will\nmake her from memory, and if the thing ‘s to be done, you had better\nhave it done as well as possible.”\n\n“Mamma hesitates,” said Miss Light, “because she does n’t know whether\nyou mean she shall pay you for the bust. I can assure you that she will\nnot pay you a sou.”\n\n“My darling, you forget yourself,” said Mrs. Light, with an attempt at\nmajestic severity. “Of course,” she added, in a moment, with a change of\nnote, “the bust would be my own property.”\n\n“Of course!” cried Roderick, impatiently.\n\n“Dearest mother,” interposed the young girl, “how can you carry a\nmarble bust about the world with you? Is it not enough to drag the poor\noriginal?”\n\n“My dear, you ‘re nonsensical!” cried Mrs. Light, almost angrily.\n\n“You can always sell it,” said the young girl, with the same artful\nartlessness.\n\nMrs. Light turned to Rowland, who pitied her, flushed and irritated.\n“She is very wicked to-day!”\n\nThe Cavaliere grinned in silence and walked away on tiptoe, with his hat\nto his lips, as if to leave the field clear for action. Rowland, on the\ncontrary, wished to avert the coming storm. “You had better not refuse,”\n he said to Miss Light, “until you have seen Mr. Hudson’s things in the\nmarble. Your mother is to come and look at some that I possess.”\n\n“Thank you; I have no doubt you will see us. I dare say Mr. Hudson is\nvery clever; but I don’t care for modern sculpture. I can’t look at it!”\n\n“You shall care for my bust, I promise you!” cried Roderick, with a\nlaugh.\n\n“To satisfy Miss Light,” said the Cavaliere, “one of the old Greeks\nought to come to life.”\n\n“It would be worth his while,” said Roderick, paying, to Rowland’s\nknowledge, his first compliment.\n\n“I might sit to Phidias, if he would promise to be very amusing and make\nme laugh. What do you say, Stenterello? would you sit to Phidias?”\n\n“We must talk of this some other time,” said Mrs. Light. “We are in\nRome for the winter. Many thanks. Cavaliere, call the carriage.” The\nCavaliere led the way out, backing like a silver-stick, and Miss Light,\nfollowing her mother, nodded, without looking at them, to each of the\nyoung men.\n\n“Immortal powers, what a head!” cried Roderick, when they had gone.\n“There ‘s my fortune!”\n\n“She is certainly very beautiful,” said Rowland. “But I ‘m sorry you\nhave undertaken her bust.”\n\n“And why, pray?”\n\n“I suspect it will bring trouble with it.”\n\n“What kind of trouble?”\n\n“I hardly know. They are queer people. The mamma, I suspect, is the\nleast bit of an adventuress. Heaven knows what the daughter is.”\n\n“She ‘s a goddess!” cried Roderick.\n\n“Just so. She is all the more dangerous.”\n\n“Dangerous? What will she do to me? She does n’t bite, I imagine.”\n\n“It remains to be seen. There are two kinds of women--you ought to\nknow it by this time--the safe and the unsafe. Miss Light, if I am not\nmistaken, is one of the unsafe. A word to the wise!”\n\n“Much obliged!” said Roderick, and he began to whistle a triumphant air,\nin honor, apparently, of the advent of his beautiful model.\n\nIn calling this young lady and her mamma “queer people,” Rowland but\nroughly expressed his sentiment. They were so marked a variation from\nthe monotonous troop of his fellow-country people that he felt much\ncuriosity as to the sources of the change, especially since he doubted\ngreatly whether, on the whole, it elevated the type. For a week he\nsaw the two ladies driving daily in a well-appointed landau, with the\nCavaliere and the poodle in the front seat. From Mrs. Light he received\na gracious salute, tempered by her native majesty; but the young girl,\nlooking straight before her, seemed profoundly indifferent to observers.\nHer extraordinary beauty, however, had already made observers numerous\nand given the habitues of the Pincian plenty to talk about. The echoes\nof their commentary reached Rowland’s ears; but he had little taste\nfor random gossip, and desired a distinctly veracious informant. He had\nfound one in the person of Madame Grandoni, for whom Mrs. Light and her\nbeautiful daughter were a pair of old friends.\n\n“I have known the mamma for twenty years,” said this judicious critic,\n“and if you ask any of the people who have been living here as long\nas I, you will find they remember her well. I have held the beautiful\nChristina on my knee when she was a little wizened baby with a very red\nface and no promise of beauty but those magnificent eyes. Ten years ago\nMrs. Light disappeared, and has not since been seen in Rome, except for\na few days last winter, when she passed through on her way to Naples.\nThen it was you met the trio in the Ludovisi gardens. When I first\nknew her she was the unmarried but very marriageable daughter of an old\nAmerican painter of very bad landscapes, which people used to buy from\ncharity and use for fire-boards. His name was Savage; it used to make\nevery one laugh, he was such a mild, melancholy, pitiful old gentleman.\nHe had married a horrible wife, an Englishwoman who had been on the\nstage. It was said she used to beat poor Savage with his mahl-stick and\nwhen the domestic finances were low to lock him up in his studio and\ntell him he should n’t come out until he had painted half a dozen of\nhis daubs. She had a good deal of showy beauty. She would then go\nforth, and, her beauty helping, she would make certain people take the\npictures. It helped her at last to make an English lord run away with\nher. At the time I speak of she had quite disappeared. Mrs. Light\nwas then a very handsome girl, though by no means so handsome as\nher daughter has now become. Mr. Light was an American consul, newly\nappointed at one of the Adriatic ports. He was a mild, fair-whiskered\nyoung man, with some little property, and my impression is that he had\ngot into bad company at home, and that his family procured him his place\nto keep him out of harm’s way. He came up to Rome on a holiday, fell\nin love with Miss Savage, and married her on the spot. He had not been\nmarried three years when he was drowned in the Adriatic, no one ever\nknew how. The young widow came back to Rome, to her father, and here\nshortly afterwards, in the shadow of Saint Peter’s, her little girl was\nborn. It might have been supposed that Mrs. Light would marry again,\nand I know she had opportunities. But she overreached herself. She\nwould take nothing less than a title and a fortune, and they were not\nforthcoming. She was admired and very fond of admiration; very vain,\nvery worldly, very silly. She remained a pretty widow, with a surprising\nvariety of bonnets and a dozen men always in her train. Giacosa dates\nfrom this period. He calls himself a Roman, but I have an impression he\ncame up from Ancona with her. He was l’ami de la maison. He used to hold\nher bouquets, clean her gloves (I was told), run her errands, get her\nopera-boxes, and fight her battles with the shopkeepers. For this he\nneeded courage, for she was smothered in debt. She at last left Rome\nto escape her creditors. Many of them must remember her still, but she\nseems now to have money to satisfy them. She left her poor old father\nhere alone--helpless, infirm and unable to work. A subscription was\nshortly afterwards taken up among the foreigners, and he was sent\nback to America, where, as I afterwards heard, he died in some sort of\nasylum. From time to time, for several years, I heard vaguely of Mrs.\nLight as a wandering beauty at French and German watering-places. Once\ncame a rumor that she was going to make a grand marriage in England;\nthen we heard that the gentleman had thought better of it and left\nher to keep afloat as she could. She was a terribly scatter-brained\ncreature. She pretends to be a great lady, but I consider that\nold Filomena, my washer-woman, is in essentials a greater one. But\ncertainly, after all, she has been fortunate. She embarked at last on\na lawsuit about some property, with her husband’s family, and went to\nAmerica to attend to it. She came back triumphant, with a long purse.\nShe reappeared in Italy, and established herself for a while in Venice.\nThen she came to Florence, where she spent a couple of years and where\nI saw her. Last year she passed down to Naples, which I should have said\nwas just the place for her, and this winter she has laid siege to Rome.\nShe seems very prosperous. She has taken a floor in the Palazzo F----,\nshe keeps her carriage, and Christina and she, between them, must have\na pretty milliner’s bill. Giacosa has turned up again, looking as if he\nhad been kept on ice at Ancona, for her return.”\n\n“What sort of education,” Rowland asked, “do you imagine the mother’s\nadventures to have been for the daughter?”\n\n“A strange school! But Mrs. Light told me, in Florence, that she had\ngiven her child the education of a princess. In other words, I suppose,\nshe speaks three or four languages, and has read several hundred French\nnovels. Christina, I suspect, is very clever. When I saw her, I was\namazed at her beauty, and, certainly, if there is any truth in faces,\nshe ought to have the soul of an angel. Perhaps she has. I don’t judge\nher; she ‘s an extraordinary young person. She has been told twenty\ntimes a day by her mother, since she was five years old, that she is a\nbeauty of beauties, that her face is her fortune, and that, if she plays\nher cards, she may marry a duke. If she has not been fatally corrupted,\nshe is a very superior girl. My own impression is that she is a mixture\nof good and bad, of ambition and indifference. Mrs. Light, having failed\nto make her own fortune in matrimony, has transferred her hopes to her\ndaughter, and nursed them till they have become a kind of monomania. She\nhas a hobby, which she rides in secret; but some day she will let you\nsee it. I ‘m sure that if you go in some evening unannounced, you will\nfind her scanning the tea-leaves in her cup, or telling her daughter’s\nfortune with a greasy pack of cards, preserved for the purpose. She\npromises her a prince--a reigning prince. But if Mrs. Light is silly,\nshe is shrewd, too, and, lest considerations of state should deny\nher prince the luxury of a love-match, she keeps on hand a few common\nmortals. At the worst she would take a duke, an English lord, or even a\nyoung American with a proper number of millions. The poor woman must be\nrather uncomfortable. She is always building castles and knocking them\ndown again--always casting her nets and pulling them in. If her\ndaughter were less of a beauty, her transparent ambition would be very\nridiculous; but there is something in the girl, as one looks at her,\nthat seems to make it very possible she is marked out for one of those\nwonderful romantic fortunes that history now and then relates. ‘Who,\nafter all, was the Empress of the French?’ Mrs. Light is forever saying.\n‘And beside Christina the Empress is a dowdy!’”\n\n“And what does Christina say?”\n\n“She makes no scruple, as you know, of saying that her mother is a fool.\nWhat she thinks, heaven knows. I suspect that, practically, she does not\ncommit herself. She is excessively proud, and thinks herself good enough\nto occupy the highest station in the world; but she knows that her\nmother talks nonsense, and that even a beautiful girl may look awkward\nin making unsuccessful advances. So she remains superbly indifferent,\nand lets her mother take the risks. If the prince is secured, so much\nthe better; if he is not, she need never confess to herself that even a\nprince has slighted her.”\n\n“Your report is as solid,” Rowland said to Madame Grandoni, thanking\nher, “as if it had been prepared for the Academy of Sciences;” and he\ncongratulated himself on having listened to it when, a couple of days\nlater, Mrs. Light and her daughter, attended by the Cavaliere and the\npoodle, came to his rooms to look at Roderick’s statues. It was more\ncomfortable to know just with whom he was dealing.\n\nMrs. Light was prodigiously gracious, and showered down compliments not\nonly on the statues, but on all his possessions. “Upon my word,” she\nsaid, “you men know how to make yourselves comfortable. If one of us\npoor women had half as many easy-chairs and knick-knacks, we should be\nfamously abused. It ‘s really selfish to be living all alone in such a\nplace as this. Cavaliere, how should you like this suite of rooms and a\nfortune to fill them with pictures and statues? Christina, love, look at\nthat mosaic table. Mr. Mallet, I could almost beg it from you. Yes,\nthat Eve is certainly very fine. We need n’t be ashamed of such a\ngreat-grandmother as that. If she was really such a beautiful woman,\nit accounts for the good looks of some of us. Where is Mr. What\n‘s-his-name, the young sculptor? Why is n’t he here to be complimented?”\n\nChristina had remained but for a moment in the chair which Rowland had\nplaced for her, had given but a cursory glance at the statues, and\nthen, leaving her place, had begun to wander round the room--looking at\nherself in the mirror, touching the ornaments and curiosities, glancing\nat the books and prints. Rowland’s sitting-room was encumbered with\nbric-a-brac, and she found plenty of occupation. Rowland presently\njoined her, and pointed out some of the objects he most valued.\n\n“It ‘s an odd jumble,” she said frankly. “Some things are very\npretty--some are very ugly. But I like ugly things, when they have a\ncertain look. Prettiness is terribly vulgar nowadays, and it is not\nevery one that knows just the sort of ugliness that has chic. But chic\nis getting dreadfully common too. There ‘s a hint of it even in Madame\nBaldi’s bonnets. I like looking at people’s things,” she added in a\nmoment, turning to Rowland and resting her eyes on him. “It helps you to\nfind out their characters.”\n\n“Am I to suppose,” asked Rowland, smiling, “that you have arrived at any\nconclusions as to mine?”\n\n“I am rather muddled; you have too many things; one seems to contradict\nanother. You are very artistic and yet you are very prosaic; you have\nwhat is called a ‘catholic’ taste and yet you are full of obstinate\nlittle prejudices and habits of thought, which, if I knew you, I should\nfind very tiresome. I don’t think I like you.”\n\n“You make a great mistake,” laughed Rowland; “I assure you I am very\namiable.”\n\n“Yes, I am probably wrong, and if I knew you, I should find out I was\nwrong, and that would irritate me and make me dislike you more. So you\nsee we are necessary enemies.”\n\n“No, I don’t dislike you.”\n\n“Worse and worse; for you certainly will not like me.”\n\n“You are very discouraging.”\n\n“I am fond of facing the truth, though some day you will deny that.\nWhere is that queer friend of yours?”\n\n“You mean Mr. Hudson. He is represented by these beautiful works.”\n\nMiss Light looked for some moments at Roderick’s statues. “Yes,” she\nsaid, “they are not so silly as most of the things we have seen. They\nhave no chic, and yet they are beautiful.”\n\n“You describe them perfectly,” said Rowland. “They are beautiful, and\nyet they have no chic. That ‘s it!”\n\n“If he will promise to put none into my bust, I have a mind to let him\nmake it. A request made in those terms deserves to be granted.”\n\n“In what terms?”\n\n“Did n’t you hear him? ‘Mademoiselle, you almost satisfy my conception\nof the beautiful. I must model your bust.’ That almost should be\nrewarded. He is like me; he likes to face the truth. I think we should\nget on together.”\n\nThe Cavaliere approached Rowland, to express the pleasure he had derived\nfrom his beautiful “collection.” His smile was exquisitely bland, his\naccent appealing, caressing, insinuating. But he gave Rowland an odd\nsense of looking at a little waxen image, adjusted to perform certain\ngestures and emit certain sounds. It had once contained a soul, but the\nsoul had leaked out. Nevertheless, Rowland reflected, there are more\nprofitless things than mere sound and gesture, in a consummate Italian.\nAnd the Cavaliere, too, had soul enough left to desire to speak a few\nwords on his own account, and call Rowland’s attention to the fact that\nhe was not, after all, a hired cicerone, but an ancient Roman gentleman.\nRowland felt sorry for him; he hardly knew why. He assured him in a\nfriendly fashion that he must come again; that his house was always at\nhis service. The Cavaliere bowed down to the ground. “You do me too much\nhonor,” he murmured. “If you will allow me--it is not impossible!”\n\nMrs. Light, meanwhile, had prepared to depart. “If you are not afraid to\ncome and see two quiet little women, we shall be most happy!” she said.\n“We have no statues nor pictures--we have nothing but each other. Eh,\ndarling?”\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said Christina.\n\n“Oh, and the Cavaliere,” added her mother.\n\n“The poodle, please!” cried the young girl.\n\nRowland glanced at the Cavaliere; he was smiling more blandly than ever.\n\nA few days later Rowland presented himself, as civility demanded, at\nMrs. Light’s door. He found her living in one of the stately houses of\nthe Via dell’ Angelo Custode, and, rather to his surprise, was told she\nwas at home. He passed through half a dozen rooms and was ushered\ninto an immense saloon, at one end of which sat the mistress of the\nestablishment, with a piece of embroidery. She received him very\ngraciously, and then, pointing mysteriously to a large screen which was\nunfolded across the embrasure of one of the deep windows, “I am keeping\nguard!” she said. Rowland looked interrogative; whereupon she beckoned\nhim forward and motioned him to look behind the screen. He obeyed, and\nfor some moments stood gazing. Roderick, with his back turned, stood\nbefore an extemporized pedestal, ardently shaping a formless mass\nof clay. Before him sat Christina Light, in a white dress, with her\nshoulders bare, her magnificent hair twisted into a classic coil, and\nher head admirably poised. Meeting Rowland’s gaze, she smiled a little,\nonly with her deep gray eyes, without moving. She looked divinely\nbeautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Christina\n\nThe brilliant Roman winter came round again, and Rowland enjoyed it,\nin a certain way, more deeply than before. He grew at last to feel that\nsense of equal possession, of intellectual nearness, which it belongs\nto the peculiar magic of the ancient city to infuse into minds of a\ncast that she never would have produced. He became passionately,\nunreasoningly fond of all Roman sights and sensations, and to breathe\nthe Roman atmosphere began to seem a needful condition of being. He\ncould not have defined and explained the nature of his great love, nor\nhave made up the sum of it by the addition of his calculable pleasures.\nIt was a large, vague, idle, half-profitless emotion, of which perhaps\nthe most pertinent thing that may be said is that it enforced a sort of\noppressive reconciliation to the present, the actual, the sensuous--to\nlife on the terms that there offered themselves. It was perhaps for this\nvery reason that, in spite of the charm which Rome flings over\none’s mood, there ran through Rowland’s meditations an undertone of\nmelancholy, natural enough in a mind which finds its horizon insidiously\nlimited to the finite, even in very picturesque forms. Whether it is one\nthat tacitly concedes to the Roman Church the monopoly of a guarantee\nof immortality, so that if one is indisposed to bargain with her for\nthe precious gift, one must do without it altogether; or whether in an\natmosphere so heavily weighted with echoes and memories one grows\nto believe that there is nothing in one’s consciousness that is not\nforedoomed to moulder and crumble and become dust for the feet, and\npossible malaria for the lungs, of future generations--the fact at least\nremains that one parts half-willingly with one’s hopes in Rome, and\nmisses them only under some very exceptional stress of circumstance. For\nthis reason one may perhaps say that there is no other place in which\none’s daily temper has such a mellow serenity, and none, at the same\ntime, in which acute attacks of depression are more intolerable. Rowland\nfound, in fact, a perfect response to his prevision that to live in Rome\nwas an education to one’s senses and one’s imagination, but he sometimes\nwondered whether this was not a questionable gain in case of one’s not\nbeing prepared to live wholly by one’s imagination and one’s senses. The\ntranquil profundity of his daily satisfaction seemed sometimes to\nturn, by a mysterious inward impulse, and face itself with questioning,\nadmonishing, threatening eyes. “But afterwards...?” it seemed to\nask, with a long reverberation; and he could give no answer but a shy\naffirmation that there was no such thing as afterwards, and a hope,\ndivided against itself, that his actual way of life would last forever.\nHe often felt heavy-hearted; he was sombre without knowing why; there\nwere no visible clouds in his heaven, but there were cloud-shadows on\nhis mood. Shadows projected, they often were, without his knowing it, by\nan undue apprehension that things after all might not go so ideally\nwell with Roderick. When he understood his anxiety it vexed him, and he\nrebuked himself for taking things unmanfully hard. If Roderick chose\nto follow a crooked path, it was no fault of his; he had given him, he\nwould continue to give him, all that he had offered him--friendship,\nsympathy, advice. He had not undertaken to provide him with unflagging\nstrength of purpose, nor to stand bondsman for unqualified success.\n\nIf Rowland felt his roots striking and spreading in the Roman soil,\nRoderick also surrendered himself with renewed abandon to the local\ninfluence. More than once he declared to his companion that he meant\nto live and die within the shadow of Saint Peter’s, and that he cared\nlittle if he never again drew breath in American air. “For a man of my\ntemperament, Rome is the only possible place,” he said; “it ‘s better to\nrecognize the fact early than late. So I shall never go home unless I am\nabsolutely forced.”\n\n“What is your idea of ‘force’?” asked Rowland, smiling. “It seems to me\nyou have an excellent reason for going home some day or other.”\n\n“Ah, you mean my engagement?” Roderick answered with unaverted eyes.\n“Yes, I am distinctly engaged, in Northampton, and impatiently waited\nfor!” And he gave a little sympathetic sigh. “To reconcile Northampton\nand Rome is rather a problem. Mary had better come out here. Even at the\nworst I have no intention of giving up Rome within six or eight years,\nand an engagement of that duration would be rather absurd.”\n\n“Miss Garland could hardly leave your mother,” Rowland observed.\n\n“Oh, of course my mother should come. I think I will suggest it in my\nnext letter. It will take her a year or two to make up her mind to it,\nbut if she consents it will brighten her up. It ‘s too small a life,\nover there, even for a timid old lady. It is hard to imagine,” he added,\n“any change in Mary being a change for the better; but I should like her\nto take a look at the world and have her notions stretched a little. One\nis never so good, I suppose, but that one can improve a little.”\n\n“If you wish your mother and Miss Garland to come,” Rowland suggested,\n“you had better go home and bring them.”\n\n“Oh, I can’t think of leaving Europe, for many a day,” Roderick\nanswered. “At present it would quite break the charm. I am just\nbeginning to profit, to get used to things and take them naturally. I am\nsure the sight of Northampton Main Street would permanently upset me.”\n\nIt was reassuring to hear that Roderick, in his own view, was but\n“just beginning” to spread his wings, and Rowland, if he had had\nany forebodings, might have suffered them to be modified by this\ndeclaration. This was the first time since their meeting at Geneva that\nRoderick had mentioned Miss Garland’s name, but the ice being broken, he\nindulged for some time afterward in frequent allusions to his\nbetrothed, which always had an accent of scrupulous, of almost studied,\nconsideration. An uninitiated observer, hearing him, would have imagined\nher to be a person of a certain age--possibly an affectionate maiden\naunt--who had once done him a kindness which he highly appreciated:\nperhaps presented him with a check for a thousand dollars. Rowland noted\nthe difference between his present frankness and his reticence during\nthe first six months of his engagement, and sometimes wondered whether\nit was not rather an anomaly that he should expatiate more largely as\nthe happy event receded. He had wondered over the whole matter, first\nand last, in a great many different ways, and looked at it in all\npossible lights. There was something terribly hard to explain in the\nfact of his having fallen in love with his cousin. She was not, as\nRowland conceived her, the sort of girl he would have been likely to\nfancy, and the operation of sentiment, in all cases so mysterious, was\nparticularly so in this one. Just why it was that Roderick should not\nlogically have fancied Miss Garland, his companion would have been at\nloss to say, but I think the conviction had its roots in an unformulated\ncomparison between himself and the accepted suitor. Roderick and he were\nas different as two men could be, and yet Roderick had taken it into his\nhead to fall in love with a woman for whom he himself had been keeping\nin reserve, for years, a profoundly characteristic passion. That if he\nchose to conceive a great notion of the merits of Roderick’s mistress,\nthe irregularity here was hardly Roderick’s, was a view of the case\nto which poor Rowland did scanty justice. There were women, he said\nto himself, whom it was every one’s business to fall in love with a\nlittle--women beautiful, brilliant, artful, easily fascinating. Miss\nLight, for instance, was one of these; every man who spoke to her did\nso, if not in the language, at least with something of the agitation,\nthe divine tremor, of a lover. There were other women--they might have\ngreat beauty, they might have small; perhaps they were generally to\nbe classified as plain--whose triumphs in this line were rare, but\nimmutably permanent. Such a one preeminently, was Mary Garland. Upon\nthe doctrine of probabilities, it was unlikely that she had had an equal\ncharm for each of them, and was it not possible, therefore, that the\ncharm for Roderick had been simply the charm imagined, unquestioningly\naccepted: the general charm of youth, sympathy, kindness--of the present\nfeminine, in short--enhanced indeed by several fine facial traits?\nThe charm in this case for Rowland was--the charm!--the mysterious,\nindividual, essential woman. There was an element in the charm, as his\ncompanion saw it, which Rowland was obliged to recognize, but which\nhe forbore to ponder; the rather important attraction, namely, of\nreciprocity. As to Miss Garland being in love with Roderick and becoming\ncharming thereby, this was a point with which his imagination ventured\nto take no liberties; partly because it would have been indelicate,\nand partly because it would have been vain. He contented himself with\nfeeling that the young girl was still as vivid an image in his memory as\nshe had been five days after he left her, and with drifting nearer and\nnearer to the impression that at just that crisis any other girl would\nhave answered Roderick’s sentimental needs as well. Any other girl\nindeed would do so still! Roderick had confessed as much to him at\nGeneva, in saying that he had been taking at Baden the measure of his\nsusceptibility to female beauty.\n\nHis extraordinary success in modeling the bust of the beautiful Miss\nLight was pertinent evidence of this amiable quality. She sat to him,\nrepeatedly, for a fortnight, and the work was rapidly finished. On one\nof the last days Roderick asked Rowland to come and give his opinion as\nto what was still wanting; for the sittings had continued to take place\nin Mrs. Light’s apartment, the studio being pronounced too damp for\nthe fair model. When Rowland presented himself, Christina, still in\nher white dress, with her shoulders bare, was standing before a mirror,\nreadjusting her hair, the arrangement of which, on this occasion, had\napparently not met the young sculptor’s approval. He stood beside her,\ndirecting the operation with a peremptoriness of tone which seemed\nto Rowland to denote a considerable advance in intimacy. As Rowland\nentered, Christina was losing patience. “Do it yourself, then!” she\ncried, and with a rapid movement unloosed the great coil of her tresses\nand let them fall over her shoulders.\n\nThey were magnificent, and with her perfect face dividing their rippling\nflow she looked like some immaculate saint of legend being led to\nmartyrdom. Rowland’s eyes presumably betrayed his admiration, but her\nown manifested no consciousness of it. If Christina was a coquette, as\nthe remarkable timeliness of this incident might have suggested, she was\nnot a superficial one.\n\n“Hudson ‘s a sculptor,” said Rowland, with warmth. “But if I were only a\npainter!”\n\n“Thank Heaven you are not!” said Christina. “I am having quite enough of\nthis minute inspection of my charms.”\n\n“My dear young man, hands off!” cried Mrs. Light, coming forward and\nseizing her daughter’s hair. “Christina, love, I am surprised.”\n\n“Is it indelicate?” Christina asked. “I beg Mr. Mallet’s pardon.” Mrs.\nLight gathered up the dusky locks and let them fall through her fingers,\nglancing at her visitor with a significant smile. Rowland had never\nbeen in the East, but if he had attempted to make a sketch of an old\nslave-merchant, calling attention to the “points” of a Circassian\nbeauty, he would have depicted such a smile as Mrs. Light’s. “Mamma ‘s\nnot really shocked,” added Christina in a moment, as if she had guessed\nher mother’s by-play. “She is only afraid that Mr. Hudson might have\ninjured my hair, and that, per consequenza, I should sell for less.”\n\n“You unnatural child!” cried mamma. “You deserve that I should make a\nfright of you!” And with half a dozen skillful passes she twisted the\ntresses into a single picturesque braid, placed high on the head, as a\nkind of coronal.\n\n“What does your mother do when she wants to do you justice?” Rowland\nasked, observing the admirable line of the young girl’s neck.\n\n“I do her justice when I say she says very improper things. What is one\nto do with such a thorn in the flesh?” Mrs. Light demanded.\n\n“Think of it at your leisure, Mr. Mallet,” said Christina, “and when you\n‘ve discovered something, let us hear. But I must tell you that I shall\nnot willingly believe in any remedy of yours, for you have something in\nyour physiognomy that particularly provokes me to make the remarks that\nmy mother so sincerely deplores. I noticed it the first time I saw you.\nI think it ‘s because your face is so broad. For some reason or other,\nbroad faces exasperate me; they fill me with a kind of rabbia. Last\nsummer, at Carlsbad, there was an Austrian count, with enormous estates\nand some great office at court. He was very attentive--seriously so; he\nwas really very far gone. Cela ne tenait qu’ a moi! But I could n’t; he\nwas impossible! He must have measured, from ear to ear, at least a yard\nand a half. And he was blond, too, which made it worse--as blond as\nStenterello; pure fleece! So I said to him frankly, ‘Many thanks, Herr\nGraf; your uniform is magnificent, but your face is too fat.’”\n\n“I am afraid that mine also,” said Rowland, with a smile, “seems just\nnow to have assumed an unpardonable latitude.”\n\n“Oh, I take it you know very well that we are looking for a husband,\nand that none but tremendous swells need apply. Surely, before these\ngentlemen, mamma, I may speak freely; they are disinterested. Mr. Mallet\nwon’t do, because, though he ‘s rich, he ‘s not rich enough. Mamma made\nthat discovery the day after we went to see you, moved to it by the\npromising look of your furniture. I hope she was right, eh? Unless you\nhave millions, you know, you have no chance.”\n\n“I feel like a beggar,” said Rowland.\n\n“Oh, some better girl than I will decide some day, after mature\nreflection, that on the whole you have enough. Mr. Hudson, of course, is\nnowhere; he has nothing but his genius and his beaux yeux.”\n\nRoderick had stood looking at Christina intently while she delivered\nherself, softly and slowly, of this surprising nonsense. When she had\nfinished, she turned and looked at him; their eyes met, and he blushed\na little. “Let me model you, and he who can may marry you!” he said,\nabruptly.\n\nMrs. Light, while her daughter talked, had been adding a few touches to\nher coiffure. “She is not so silly as you might suppose,” she said to\nRowland, with dignity. “If you will give me your arm, we will go and\nlook at the bust.”\n\n“Does that represent a silly girl?” Christina demanded, when they stood\nbefore it.\n\nRowland transferred his glance several times from the portrait to the\noriginal. “It represents a young lady,” he said, “whom I should not\npretend to judge off-hand.”\n\n“She may be a fool, but you are not sure. Many thanks! You have seen me\nhalf a dozen times. You are either very slow or I am very deep.”\n\n“I am certainly slow,” said Rowland. “I don’t expect to make up my mind\nabout you within six months.”\n\n“I give you six months if you will promise then a perfectly frank\nopinion. Mind, I shall not forget; I shall insist upon it.”\n\n“Well, though I am slow, I am tolerably brave,” said Rowland. “We shall\nsee.”\n\nChristina looked at the bust with a sigh. “I am afraid, after all,” she\nsaid, “that there ‘s very little wisdom in it save what the artist has\nput there. Mr. Hudson looked particularly wise while he was working; he\nscowled and growled, but he never opened his mouth. It is very kind of\nhim not to have represented me gaping.”\n\n“If I had talked a lot of stuff to you,” said Roderick, roundly, “the\nthing would not have been a tenth so good.”\n\n“Is it good, after all? Mr. Mallet is a famous connoisseur; has he not\ncome here to pronounce?”\n\nThe bust was in fact a very happy performance, and Roderick had risen to\nthe level of his subject. It was thoroughly a portrait, and not a vague\nfantasy executed on a graceful theme, as the busts of pretty women, in\nmodern sculpture, are apt to be. The resemblance was deep and vivid;\nthere was extreme fidelity of detail and yet a noble simplicity.\nOne could say of the head that, without idealization, it was a\nrepresentation of ideal beauty. Rowland, however, as we know, was not\nfond of exploding into superlatives, and, after examining the piece,\ncontented himself with suggesting two or three alterations of detail.\n\n“Nay, how can you be so cruel?” demanded Mrs. Light, with soft\nreproachfulness. “It is surely a wonderful thing!”\n\n“Rowland knows it ‘s a wonderful thing,” said Roderick, smiling. “I can\ntell that by his face. The other day I finished something he thought\nbad, and he looked very differently from this.”\n\n“How did Mr. Mallet look?” asked Christina.\n\n“My dear Rowland,” said Roderick, “I am speaking of my seated woman. You\nlooked as if you had on a pair of tight boots.”\n\n“Ah, my child, you ‘ll not understand that!” cried Mrs. Light. “You\nnever yet had a pair that were small enough.”\n\n“It ‘s a pity, Mr. Hudson,” said Christina, gravely, “that you could\nnot have introduced my feet into the bust. But we can hang a pair of\nslippers round the neck!”\n\n“I nevertheless like your statues, Roderick,” Rowland rejoined, “better\nthan your jokes. This is admirable. Miss Light, you may be proud!”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Mallet, for the permission,” rejoined the young girl.\n\n“I am dying to see it in the marble, with a red velvet screen behind\nit,” said Mrs. Light.\n\n“Placed there under the Sassoferrato!” Christina went on. “I hope you\nkeep well in mind, Mr. Hudson, that you have not a grain of property in\nyour work, and that if mamma chooses, she may have it photographed and\nthe copies sold in the Piazza di Spagna, at five francs apiece, without\nyour having a sou of the profits.”\n\n“Amen!” said Roderick. “It was so nominated in the bond. My profits are\nhere!” and he tapped his forehead.\n\n“It would be prettier if you said here!” And Christina touched her\nheart.\n\n“My precious child, how you do run on!” murmured Mrs. Light.\n\n“It is Mr. Mallet,” the young girl answered. “I can’t talk a word of\nsense so long as he is in the room. I don’t say that to make you go,”\n she added, “I say it simply to justify myself.”\n\nRowland bowed in silence. Roderick declared that he must get at work and\nrequested Christina to take her usual position, and Mrs. Light proposed\nto her visitor that they should adjourn to her boudoir. This was a\nsmall room, hardly more spacious than an alcove, opening out of the\ndrawing-room and having no other issue. Here, as they entered, on a\ndivan near the door, Rowland perceived the Cavaliere Giacosa, with his\narms folded, his head dropped upon his breast, and his eyes closed.\n\n“Sleeping at his post!” said Rowland with a kindly laugh.\n\n“That ‘s a punishable offense,” rejoined Mrs. Light, sharply. She was on\nthe point of calling him, in the same tone, when he suddenly opened his\neyes, stared a moment, and then rose with a smile and a bow.\n\n“Excuse me, dear lady,” he said, “I was overcome by the--the great\nheat.”\n\n“Nonsense, Cavaliere!” cried the lady, “you know we are perishing here\nwith the cold! You had better go and cool yourself in one of the other\nrooms.”\n\n“I obey, dear lady,” said the Cavaliere; and with another smile and bow\nto Rowland he departed, walking very discreetly on his toes. Rowland\nout-stayed him but a short time, for he was not fond of Mrs. Light,\nand he found nothing very inspiring in her frank intimation that if he\nchose, he might become a favorite. He was disgusted with himself for\npleasing her; he confounded his fatal urbanity. In the court-yard of the\npalace he overtook the Cavaliere, who had stopped at the porter’s lodge\nto say a word to his little girl. She was a young lady of very tender\nyears and she wore a very dirty pinafore. He had taken her up in his\narms and was singing an infantine rhyme to her, and she was staring at\nhim with big, soft Roman eyes. On seeing Rowland he put her down with\na kiss, and stepped forward with a conscious grin, an unresentful\nadmission that he was sensitive both to chubbiness and ridicule.\nRowland began to pity him again; he had taken his dismissal from the\ndrawing-room so meekly.\n\n“You don’t keep your promise,” said Rowland, “to come and see me. Don’t\nforget it. I want you to tell me about Rome thirty years ago.”\n\n“Thirty years ago? Ah, dear sir, Rome is Rome still; a place where\nstrange things happen! But happy things too, since I have your renewed\npermission to call. You do me too much honor. Is it in the morning or in\nthe evening that I should least intrude?”\n\n“Take your own time, Cavaliere; only come, sometime. I depend upon you,”\n said Rowland.\n\nThe Cavaliere thanked him with an humble obeisance. To the Cavaliere,\ntoo, he felt that he was, in Roman phrase, sympathetic, but the idea of\npleasing this extremely reduced gentleman was not disagreeable to him.\n\nMiss Light’s bust stood for a while on exhibition in Roderick’s studio,\nand half the foreign colony came to see it. With the completion of his\nwork, however, Roderick’s visits at the Palazzo F---- by no means came\nto an end. He spent half his time in Mrs. Light’s drawing-room, and\nbegan to be talked about as “attentive” to Christina. The success of the\nbust restored his equanimity, and in the garrulity of his good-humor he\nsuffered Rowland to see that she was just now the object uppermost in\nhis thoughts. Rowland, when they talked of her, was rather listener\nthan speaker; partly because Roderick’s own tone was so resonant and\nexultant, and partly because, when his companion laughed at him for\nhaving called her unsafe, he was too perplexed to defend himself.\nThe impression remained that she was unsafe; that she was a complex,\nwillful, passionate creature, who might easily engulf a too confiding\nspirit in the eddies of her capricious temper. And yet he strongly felt\nher charm; the eddies had a strange fascination! Roderick, in the glow\nof that renewed admiration provoked by the fixed attention of portrayal,\nwas never weary of descanting on the extraordinary perfection of her\nbeauty.\n\n“I had no idea of it,” he said, “till I began to look at her with an eye\nto reproducing line for line and curve for curve. Her face is the most\nexquisite piece of modeling that ever came from creative hands. Not\na line without meaning, not a hair’s breadth that is not admirably\nfinished. And then her mouth! It ‘s as if a pair of lips had been shaped\nto utter pure truth without doing it dishonor!” Later, after he had been\nworking for a week, he declared if Miss Light were inordinately plain,\nshe would still be the most fascinating of women. “I ‘ve quite forgotten\nher beauty,” he said, “or rather I have ceased to perceive it as\nsomething distinct and defined, something independent of the rest of\nher. She is all one, and all consummately interesting!”\n\n“What does she do--what does she say, that is so remarkable?” Rowland\nhad asked.\n\n“Say? Sometimes nothing--sometimes everything. She is never the same.\nSometimes she walks in and takes her place without a word, without a\nsmile, gravely, stiffly, as if it were an awful bore. She hardly looks\nat me, and she walks away without even glancing at my work. On other\ndays she laughs and chatters and asks endless questions, and pours out\nthe most irresistible nonsense. She is a creature of moods; you can’t\ncount upon her; she keeps observation on the stretch. And then, bless\nyou, she has seen such a lot! Her talk is full of the oddest allusions!”\n\n“It is altogether a very singular type of young lady,” said Rowland,\nafter the visit which I have related at length. “It may be a charm, but\nit is certainly not the orthodox charm of marriageable maidenhood, the\ncharm of shrinking innocence and soft docility. Our American girls\nare accused of being more knowing than any others, and Miss Light is\nnominally an American. But it has taken twenty years of Europe to make\nher what she is. The first time we saw her, I remember you called her a\nproduct of the old world, and certainly you were not far wrong.”\n\n“Ah, she has an atmosphere,” said Roderick, in the tone of high\nappreciation.\n\n“Young unmarried women,” Rowland answered, “should be careful not to\nhave too much!”\n\n“Ah, you don’t forgive her,” cried his companion, “for hitting you so\nhard! A man ought to be flattered at such a girl as that taking so much\nnotice of him.”\n\n“A man is never flattered at a woman’s not liking him.”\n\n“Are you sure she does n’t like you? That ‘s to the credit of your\nhumility. A fellow of more vanity might, on the evidence, persuade\nhimself that he was in favor.”\n\n“He would have also,” said Rowland, laughing, “to be a fellow of\nremarkable ingenuity!” He asked himself privately how the deuce Roderick\nreconciled it to his conscience to think so much more of the girl he\nwas not engaged to than of the girl he was. But it amounted almost to\narrogance, you may say, in poor Rowland to pretend to know how often\nRoderick thought of Miss Garland. He wondered gloomily, at any rate,\nwhether for men of his companion’s large, easy power, there was not\na larger moral law than for narrow mediocrities like himself, who,\nyielding Nature a meagre interest on her investment (such as it was),\nhad no reason to expect from her this affectionate laxity as to their\naccounts. Was it not a part of the eternal fitness of things that\nRoderick, while rhapsodizing about Miss Light, should have it at his\ncommand to look at you with eyes of the most guileless and unclouded\nblue, and to shake off your musty imputations by a toss of his\npicturesque brown locks? Or had he, in fact, no conscience to speak of?\nHappy fellow, either way!\n\nOur friend Gloriani came, among others, to congratulate Roderick on\nhis model and what he had made of her. “Devilish pretty, through and\nthrough!” he said as he looked at the bust. “Capital handling of the\nneck and throat; lovely work on the nose. You ‘re a detestably lucky\nfellow, my boy! But you ought not to have squandered such material on a\nsimple bust; you should have made a great imaginative figure. If I could\nonly have got hold of her, I would have put her into a statue in spite\nof herself. What a pity she is not a ragged Trasteverine, whom we might\nhave for a franc an hour! I have been carrying about in my head for\nyears a delicious design for a fantastic figure, but it has always\nstayed there for want of a tolerable model. I have seen intimations of\nthe type, but Miss Light is the perfection of it. As soon as I saw her I\nsaid to myself, ‘By Jove, there ‘s my statue in the flesh!’”\n\n“What is your subject?” asked Roderick.\n\n“Don’t take it ill,” said Gloriani. “You know I ‘m the very deuce for\nobservation. She would make a magnificent Herodias!”\n\nIf Roderick had taken it ill (which was unlikely, for we know he thought\nGloriani an ass, and expected little of his wisdom), he might have been\nsoothed by the candid incense of Sam Singleton, who came and sat for an\nhour in a sort of mental prostration before both bust and artist.\nBut Roderick’s attitude before his patient little devotee was one\nof undisguised though friendly amusement; and, indeed, judged from a\nstrictly plastic point of view, the poor fellow’s diminutive stature,\nhis enormous mouth, his pimples and his yellow hair were sufficiently\nridiculous. “Nay, don’t envy our friend,” Rowland said to Singleton\nafterwards, on his expressing, with a little groan of depreciation of\nhis own paltry performances, his sense of the brilliancy of Roderick’s\ntalent. “You sail nearer the shore, but you sail in smoother waters. Be\ncontented with what you are and paint me another picture.”\n\n“Oh, I don’t envy Hudson anything he possesses,” Singleton said,\n“because to take anything away would spoil his beautiful completeness.\n‘Complete,’ that ‘s what he is; while we little clevernesses are like\nhalf-ripened plums, only good eating on the side that has had a glimpse\nof the sun. Nature has made him so, and fortune confesses to it! He is\nthe handsomest fellow in Rome, he has the most genius, and, as a matter\nof course, the most beautiful girl in the world comes and offers to be\nhis model. If that is not completeness, where shall we find it?”\n\nOne morning, going into Roderick’s studio, Rowland found the young\nsculptor entertaining Miss Blanchard--if this is not too flattering a\ndescription of his gracefully passive tolerance of her presence. He had\nnever liked her and never climbed into her sky-studio to observe her\nwonderful manipulation of petals. He had once quoted Tennyson against\nher:--\n\n“And is there any moral shut\nWithin the bosom of the rose?”\n\n“In all Miss Blanchard’s roses you may be sure there is a moral,” he had\nsaid. “You can see it sticking out its head, and, if you go to smell the\nflower, it scratches your nose.” But on this occasion she had come\nwith a propitiatory gift--introducing her friend Mr. Leavenworth. Mr.\nLeavenworth was a tall, expansive, bland gentleman, with a carefully\nbrushed whisker and a spacious, fair, well-favored face, which seemed,\nsomehow, to have more room in it than was occupied by a smile of\nsuperior benevolence, so that (with his smooth, white forehead) it bore\na certain resemblance to a large parlor with a very florid carpet, but\nno pictures on the walls. He held his head high, talked sonorously, and\ntold Roderick, within five minutes, that he was a widower, traveling\nto distract his mind, and that he had lately retired from the\nproprietorship of large mines of borax in Pennsylvania. Roderick\nsupposed at first that, in his character of depressed widower, he had\ncome to order a tombstone; but observing then the extreme blandness\nof his address to Miss Blanchard, he credited him with a judicious\nprevision that by the time the tombstone was completed, a monument\nof his inconsolability might have become an anachronism. But Mr.\nLeavenworth was disposed to order something.\n\n“You will find me eager to patronize our indigenous talent,” he said. “I\nam putting up a little shanty in my native town, and I propose to make\na rather nice thing of it. It has been the will of Heaven to plunge me\ninto mourning; but art has consolations! In a tasteful home, surrounded\nby the memorials of my wanderings, I hope to take more cheerful views.\nI ordered in Paris the complete appurtenances of a dining-room. Do you\nthink you could do something for my library? It is to be filled\nwith well-selected authors, and I think a pure white image in this\nstyle,”--pointing to one of Roderick’s statues,--“standing out against\nthe morocco and gilt, would have a noble effect. The subject I have\nalready fixed upon. I desire an allegorical representation of Culture.\nDo you think, now,” asked Mr. Leavenworth, encouragingly, “you could\nrise to the conception?”\n\n“A most interesting subject for a truly serious mind,” remarked Miss\nBlanchard.\n\nRoderick looked at her a moment, and then--“The simplest thing I\ncould do,” he said, “would be to make a full-length portrait of Miss\nBlanchard. I could give her a scroll in her hand, and that would do for\nthe allegory.”\n\nMiss Blanchard colored; the compliment might be ironical; and there\nwas ever afterwards a reflection of her uncertainty in her opinion of\nRoderick’s genius. Mr. Leavenworth responded that with all deference to\nMiss Blanchard’s beauty, he desired something colder, more monumental,\nmore impersonal. “If I were to be the happy possessor of a likeness of\nMiss Blanchard,” he added, “I should prefer to have it in no factitious\ndisguise!”\n\nRoderick consented to entertain the proposal, and while they were\ndiscussing it, Rowland had a little talk with the fair artist. “Who is\nyour friend?” he asked.\n\n“A very worthy man. The architect of his own fortune--which is\nmagnificent. One of nature’s gentlemen!”\n\nThis was a trifle sententious, and Rowland turned to the bust of Miss\nLight. Like every one else in Rome, by this time, Miss Blanchard had\nan opinion on the young girl’s beauty, and, in her own fashion, she\nexpressed it epigrammatically. “She looks half like a Madonna and half\nlike a ballerina,” she said.\n\nMr. Leavenworth and Roderick came to an understanding, and the young\nsculptor good-naturedly promised to do his best to rise to his patron’s\nconception. “His conception be hanged!” Roderick exclaimed, after he had\ndeparted. “His conception is sitting on a globe with a pen in her ear\nand a photographic album in her hand. I shall have to conceive, myself.\nFor the money, I ought to be able to!”\n\nMrs. Light, meanwhile, had fairly established herself in Roman society.\n“Heaven knows how!” Madame Grandoni said to Rowland, who had mentioned\nto her several evidences of the lady’s prosperity. “In such a case\nthere is nothing like audacity. A month ago she knew no one but her\nwasherwoman, and now I am told that the cards of Roman princesses are to\nbe seen on her table. She is evidently determined to play a great\npart, and she has the wit to perceive that, to make remunerative\nacquaintances, you must seem yourself to be worth knowing. You must\nhave striking rooms and a confusing variety of dresses, and give good\ndinners, and so forth. She is spending a lot of money, and you ‘ll see\nthat in two or three weeks she will take upon herself to open the season\nby giving a magnificent ball. Of course it is Christina’s beauty that\nfloats her. People go to see her because they are curious.”\n\n“And they go again because they are charmed,” said Rowland. “Miss\nChristina is a very remarkable young lady.”\n\n“Oh, I know it well; I had occasion to say so to myself the other day.\nShe came to see me, of her own free will, and for an hour she was deeply\ninteresting. I think she ‘s an actress, but she believes in her part\nwhile she is playing it. She took it into her head the other day to\nbelieve that she was very unhappy, and she sat there, where you are\nsitting, and told me a tale of her miseries which brought tears into my\neyes. She cried, herself, profusely, and as naturally as possible. She\nsaid she was weary of life and that she knew no one but me she could\nspeak frankly to. She must speak, or she would go mad. She sobbed as if\nher heart would break. I assure you it ‘s well for you susceptible young\nmen that you don’t see her when she sobs. She said, in so many words,\nthat her mother was an immoral woman. Heaven knows what she meant. She\nmeant, I suppose, that she makes debts that she knows she can’t pay. She\nsaid the life they led was horrible; that it was monstrous a poor girl\nshould be dragged about the world to be sold to the highest bidder. She\nwas meant for better things; she could be perfectly happy in poverty. It\nwas not money she wanted. I might not believe her, but she really cared\nfor serious things. Sometimes she thought of taking poison!”\n\n“What did you say to that?”\n\n“I recommended her,” said Madame Grandoni, “to come and see me\ninstead. I would help her about as much, and I was, on the whole, less\nunpleasant. Of course I could help her only by letting her talk herself\nout and kissing her and patting her beautiful hands and telling her to\nbe patient and she would be happy yet. About once in two months I expect\nher to reappear, on the same errand, and meanwhile to quite forget my\nexistence. I believe I melted down to the point of telling her that\nI would find some good, quiet, affectionate husband for her; but she\ndeclared, almost with fury, that she was sick unto death of husbands,\nand begged I would never again mention the word. And, in fact, it was a\nrash offer; for I am sure that there is not a man of the kind that might\nreally make a woman happy but would be afraid to marry mademoiselle.\nLooked at in that way she is certainly very much to be pitied, and\nindeed, altogether, though I don’t think she either means all she says\nor, by a great deal, says all that she means. I feel very sorry for\nher.”\n\nRowland met the two ladies, about this time, at several entertainments,\nand looked at Christina with a kind of distant attendrissement. He\nimagined more than once that there had been a passionate scene between\nthem about coming out, and wondered what arguments Mrs. Light had found\neffective. But Christina’s face told no tales, and she moved about,\nbeautiful and silent, looking absently over people’s heads, barely\nheeding the men who pressed about her, and suggesting somehow that the\nsoul of a world-wearied mortal had found its way into the blooming body\nof a goddess. “Where in the world has Miss Light been before she is\ntwenty,” observers asked, “to have left all her illusions behind?” And\nthe general verdict was, that though she was incomparably beautiful, she\nwas intolerably proud. Young ladies to whom the former distinction was\nnot conceded were free to reflect that she was “not at all liked.”\n\nIt would have been difficult to guess, however, how they reconciled this\nconviction with a variety of conflicting evidence, and, in especial,\nwith the spectacle of Roderick’s inveterate devotion. All Rome might\nbehold that he, at least, “liked” Christina Light. Wherever she\nappeared he was either awaiting her or immediately followed her. He was\nperpetually at her side, trying, apparently, to preserve the thread of\na disconnected talk, the fate of which was, to judge by her face,\nprofoundly immaterial to the young lady. People in general smiled at the\nradiant good faith of the handsome young sculptor, and asked each other\nwhether he really supposed that beauties of that quality were meant to\nwed with poor artists. But although Christina’s deportment, as I have\nsaid, was one of superb inexpressiveness, Rowland had derived from\nRoderick no suspicion that he suffered from snubbing, and he was\ntherefore surprised at an incident which befell one evening at a large\nmusical party. Roderick, as usual, was in the field, and, on the ladies\ntaking the chairs which had been arranged for them, he immediately\nplaced himself beside Christina. As most of the gentlemen were standing,\nhis position made him as conspicuous as Hamlet at Ophelia’s feet, at the\nplay. Rowland was leaning, somewhat apart, against the chimney-piece.\nThere was a long, solemn pause before the music began, and in the midst\nof it Christina rose, left her place, came the whole length of the\nimmense room, with every one looking at her, and stopped before him. She\nwas neither pale nor flushed; she had a soft smile.\n\n“Will you do me a favor?” she asked.\n\n“A thousand!”\n\n“Not now, but at your earliest convenience. Please remind Mr. Hudson\nthat he is not in a New England village--that it is not the custom in\nRome to address one’s conversation exclusively, night after night, to\nthe same poor girl, and that”....\n\nThe music broke out with a great blare and covered her voice. She made a\ngesture of impatience, and Rowland offered her his arm and led her back\nto her seat.\n\nThe next day he repeated her words to Roderick, who burst into joyous\nlaughter. “She ‘s a delightfully strange girl!” he cried. “She must do\neverything that comes into her head!”\n\n“Had she never asked you before not to talk to her so much?”\n\n“On the contrary, she has often said to me, ‘Mind you now, I forbid you\nto leave me. Here comes that tiresome So-and-so.’ She cares as little\nabout the custom as I do. What could be a better proof than her walking\nup to you, with five hundred people looking at her? Is that the custom\nfor young girls in Rome?”\n\n“Why, then, should she take such a step?”\n\n“Because, as she sat there, it came into her head. That ‘s reason enough\nfor her. I have imagined she wishes me well, as they say here--though\nshe has never distinguished me in such a way as that!”\n\nMadame Grandoni had foretold the truth; Mrs. Light, a couple of weeks\nlater, convoked all Roman society to a brilliant ball. Rowland went\nlate, and found the staircase so encumbered with flower-pots and\nservants that he was a long time making his way into the presence of the\nhostess. At last he approached her, as she stood making courtesies at\nthe door, with her daughter by her side. Some of Mrs. Light’s courtesies\nwere very low, for she had the happiness of receiving a number of the\nsocial potentates of the Roman world. She was rosy with triumph, to say\nnothing of a less metaphysical cause, and was evidently vastly contented\nwith herself, with her company, and with the general promise of destiny.\nHer daughter was less overtly jubilant, and distributed her greetings\nwith impartial frigidity. She had never been so beautiful. Dressed\nsimply in vaporous white, relieved with half a dozen white roses, the\nperfection of her features and of her person and the mysterious depth of\nher expression seemed to glow with the white light of a splendid pearl.\nShe recognized no one individually, and made her courtesy slowly,\ngravely, with her eyes on the ground. Rowland fancied that, as he stood\nbefore her, her obeisance was slightly exaggerated, as with an intention\nof irony; but he smiled philosophically to himself, and reflected, as\nhe passed into the room, that, if she disliked him, he had nothing\nto reproach himself with. He walked about, had a few words with Miss\nBlanchard, who, with a fillet of cameos in her hair, was leaning on the\narm of Mr. Leavenworth, and at last came upon the Cavaliere Giacosa,\nmodestly stationed in a corner. The little gentleman’s coat-lappet was\ndecorated with an enormous bouquet and his neck encased in a voluminous\nwhite handkerchief of the fashion of thirty years ago. His arms were\nfolded, and he was surveying the scene with contracted eyelids, through\nwhich you saw the glitter of his intensely dark, vivacious pupil.\nHe immediately embarked on an elaborate apology for not having yet\nmanifested, as he felt it, his sense of the honor Rowland had done him.\n\n“I am always on service with these ladies, you see,” he explained, “and\nthat is a duty to which one would not willingly be faithless for an\ninstant.”\n\n“Evidently,” said Rowland, “you are a very devoted friend. Mrs. Light,\nin her situation, is very happy in having you.”\n\n“We are old friends,” said the Cavaliere, gravely. “Old friends. I knew\nthe signora many years ago, when she was the prettiest woman in Rome--or\nrather in Ancona, which is even better. The beautiful Christina, now, is\nperhaps the most beautiful young girl in Europe!”\n\n“Very likely,” said Rowland.\n\n“Very well, sir, I taught her to read; I guided her little hands to\ntouch the piano keys.” And at these faded memories, the Cavaliere’s eyes\nglittered more brightly. Rowland half expected him to proceed, with a\nlittle flash of long-repressed passion, “And now--and now, sir, they\ntreat me as you observed the other day!” But the Cavaliere only looked\nout at him keenly from among his wrinkles, and seemed to say, with all\nthe vividness of the Italian glance, “Oh, I say nothing more. I am not\nso shallow as to complain!”\n\nEvidently the Cavaliere was not shallow, and Rowland repeated\nrespectfully, “You are a devoted friend.”\n\n“That ‘s very true. I am a devoted friend. A man may do himself justice,\nafter twenty years!”\n\nRowland, after a pause, made some remark about the beauty of the ball.\nIt was very brilliant.\n\n“Stupendous!” said the Cavaliere, solemnly. “It is a great day. We have\nfour Roman princes, to say nothing of others.” And he counted them over\non his fingers and held up his hand triumphantly. “And there she stands,\nthe girl to whom I--I, Giuseppe Giacosa--taught her alphabet and her\npiano-scales; there she stands in her incomparable beauty, and Roman\nprinces come and bow to her. Here, in his corner, her old master permits\nhimself to be proud.”\n\n“It is very friendly of him,” said Rowland, smiling.\n\nThe Cavaliere contracted his lids a little more and gave another keen\nglance. “It is very natural, signore. The Christina is a good girl; she\nremembers my little services. But here comes,” he added in a moment,\n“the young Prince of the Fine Arts. I am sure he has bowed lowest of\nall.”\n\nRowland looked round and saw Roderick moving slowly across the room and\ncasting about him his usual luminous, unshrinking looks. He presently\njoined them, nodded familiarly to the Cavaliere, and immediately\ndemanded of Rowland, “Have you seen her?”\n\n“I have seen Miss Light,” said Rowland. “She ‘s magnificent.”\n\n“I ‘m half crazy!” cried Roderick; so loud that several persons turned\nround.\n\nRowland saw that he was flushed, and laid his hand on his arm. Roderick\nwas trembling. “If you will go away,” Rowland said instantly, “I will go\nwith you.”\n\n“Go away?” cried Roderick, almost angrily. “I intend to dance with her!”\n\nThe Cavaliere had been watching him attentively; he gently laid his hand\non his other arm. “Softly, softly, dear young man,” he said. “Let me\nspeak to you as a friend.”\n\n“Oh, speak even as an enemy and I shall not mind it,” Roderick answered,\nfrowning.\n\n“Be very reasonable, then, and go away.”\n\n“Why the deuce should I go away?”\n\n“Because you are in love,” said the Cavaliere.\n\n“I might as well be in love here as in the streets.”\n\n“Carry your love as far as possible from Christina. She will not listen\nto you--she can’t.”\n\n“She ‘can’t’?” demanded Roderick. “She is not a person of whom you may\nsay that. She can if she will; she does as she chooses.”\n\n“Up to a certain point. It would take too long to explain; I only beg\nyou to believe that if you continue to love Miss Light you will be\nvery unhappy. Have you a princely title? have you a princely fortune?\nOtherwise you can never have her.”\n\nAnd the Cavaliere folded his arms again, like a man who has done his\nduty. Roderick wiped his forehead and looked askance at Rowland; he\nseemed to be guessing his thoughts and they made him blush a little. But\nhe smiled blandly, and addressing the Cavaliere, “I ‘m much obliged to\nyou for the information,” he said. “Now that I have obtained it, let\nme tell you that I am no more in love with Miss Light than you are. Mr.\nMallet knows that. I admire her--yes, profoundly. But that ‘s no one’s\nbusiness but my own, and though I have, as you say, neither a princely\ntitle nor a princely fortune, I mean to suffer neither those advantages\nnor those who possess them to diminish my right.”\n\n“If you are not in love, my dear young man,” said the Cavaliere, with\nhis hand on his heart and an apologetic smile, “so much the better. But\nlet me entreat you, as an affectionate friend, to keep a watch on your\nemotions. You are young, you are handsome, you have a brilliant genius\nand a generous heart, but--I may say it almost with authority--Christina\nis not for you!”\n\nWhether Roderick was in love or not, he was nettled by what apparently\nseemed to him an obtrusive negation of an inspiring possibility. “You\nspeak as if she had made her choice!” he cried. “Without pretending to\nconfidential information on the subject, I am sure she has not.”\n\n“No, but she must make it soon,” said the Cavaliere. And raising his\nforefinger, he laid it against his under lip. “She must choose a name\nand a fortune--and she will!”\n\n“She will do exactly as her inclination prompts! She will marry the man\nwho pleases her, if he has n’t a dollar! I know her better than you.”\n\nThe Cavaliere turned a little paler than usual, and smiled more\nurbanely. “No, no, my dear young man, you do not know her better than\nI. You have not watched her, day by day, for twenty years. I too have\nadmired her. She is a good girl; she has never said an unkind word\nto me; the blessed Virgin be thanked! But she must have a brilliant\ndestiny; it has been marked out for her, and she will submit. You had\nbetter believe me; it may save you much suffering.”\n\n“We shall see!” said Roderick, with an excited laugh.\n\n“Certainly we shall see. But I retire from the discussion,” the\nCavaliere added. “I have no wish to provoke you to attempt to prove to\nme that I am wrong. You are already excited.”\n\n“No more than is natural to a man who in an hour or so is to dance the\ncotillon with Miss Light.”\n\n“The cotillon? has she promised?”\n\nRoderick patted the air with a grand confidence. “You ‘ll see!” His\ngesture might almost have been taken to mean that the state of his\nrelations with Miss Light was such that they quite dispensed with vain\nformalities.\n\nThe Cavaliere gave an exaggerated shrug. “You make a great many\nmourners!”\n\n“He has made one already!” Rowland murmured to himself. This was\nevidently not the first time that reference had been made between\nRoderick and the Cavaliere to the young man’s possible passion, and\nRoderick had failed to consider it the simplest and most natural course\nto say in three words to the vigilant little gentleman that there was\nno cause for alarm--his affections were preoccupied. Rowland hoped,\nsilently, with some dryness, that his motives were of a finer kind\nthan they seemed to be. He turned away; it was irritating to look at\nRoderick’s radiant, unscrupulous eagerness. The tide was setting toward\nthe supper-room and he drifted with it to the door. The crowd at this\npoint was dense, and he was obliged to wait for some minutes before he\ncould advance. At last he felt his neighbors dividing behind him, and\nturning he saw Christina pressing her way forward alone. She was looking\nat no one, and, save for the fact of her being alone, you would not have\nsupposed she was in her mother’s house. As she recognized Rowland she\nbeckoned to him, took his arm, and motioned him to lead her into the\nsupper-room. She said nothing until he had forced a passage and they\nstood somewhat isolated.\n\n“Take me into the most out-of-the-way corner you can find,” she then\nsaid, “and then go and get me a piece of bread.”\n\n“Nothing more? There seems to be everything conceivable.”\n\n“A simple roll. Nothing more, on your peril. Only bring something for\nyourself.”\n\nIt seemed to Rowland that the embrasure of a window (embrasures in Roman\npalaces are deep) was a retreat sufficiently obscure for Miss Light to\nexecute whatever design she might have contrived against his equanimity.\nA roll, after he had found her a seat, was easily procured. As he\npresented it, he remarked that, frankly speaking, he was at loss to\nunderstand why she should have selected for the honor of a tete-a-tete\nan individual for whom she had so little taste.\n\n“Ah yes, I dislike you,” said Christina. “To tell the truth, I had\nforgotten it. There are so many people here whom I dislike more, that\nwhen I espied you just now, you seemed like an intimate friend. But I\nhave not come into this corner to talk nonsense,” she went on. “You must\nnot think I always do, eh?”\n\n“I have never heard you do anything else,” said Rowland, deliberately,\nhaving decided that he owed her no compliments.\n\n“Very good. I like your frankness. It ‘s quite true. You see, I am a\nstrange girl. To begin with, I am frightfully egotistical. Don’t flatter\nyourself you have said anything very clever if you ever take it into\nyour head to tell me so. I know it much better than you. So it is, I\ncan’t help it. I am tired to death of myself; I would give all I possess\nto get out of myself; but somehow, at the end, I find myself so vastly\nmore interesting than nine tenths of the people I meet. If a person\nwished to do me a favor I would say to him, ‘I beg you, with tears in my\neyes, to interest me. Be strong, be positive, be imperious, if you\nwill; only be something,--something that, in looking at, I can forget my\ndetestable self!’ Perhaps that is nonsense too. If it is, I can’t help\nit. I can only apologize for the nonsense I know to be such and that I\ntalk--oh, for more reasons than I can tell you! I wonder whether, if I\nwere to try, you would understand me.”\n\n“I am afraid I should never understand,” said Rowland, “why a person\nshould willingly talk nonsense.”\n\n“That proves how little you know about women. But I like your frankness.\nWhen I told you the other day that you displeased me, I had an idea\nyou were more formal,--how do you say it?--more guinde. I am very\ncapricious. To-night I like you better.”\n\n“Oh, I am not guinde,” said Rowland, gravely.\n\n“I beg your pardon, then, for thinking so. Now I have an idea that you\nwould make a useful friend--an intimate friend--a friend to whom one\ncould tell everything. For such a friend, what would n’t I give!”\n\nRowland looked at her in some perplexity. Was this touching sincerity,\nor unfathomable coquetry? Her beautiful eyes looked divinely candid; but\nthen, if candor was beautiful, beauty was apt to be subtle. “I hesitate\nto recommend myself out and out for the office,” he said, “but I believe\nthat if you were to depend upon me for anything that a friend may do, I\nshould not be found wanting.”\n\n“Very good. One of the first things one asks of a friend is to judge\none not by isolated acts, but by one’s whole conduct. I care for your\nopinion--I don’t know why.”\n\n“Nor do I, I confess,” said Rowland with a laugh.\n\n“What do you think of this affair?” she continued, without heeding his\nlaugh.\n\n“Of your ball? Why, it ‘s a very grand affair.”\n\n“It ‘s horrible--that ‘s what it is! It ‘s a mere rabble! There are\npeople here whom I never saw before, people who were never asked. Mamma\nwent about inviting every one, asking other people to invite any one\nthey knew, doing anything to have a crowd. I hope she is satisfied! It\nis not my doing. I feel weary, I feel angry, I feel like crying. I have\ntwenty minds to escape into my room and lock the door and let mamma go\nthrough with it as she can. By the way,” she added in a moment, without\na visible reason for the transition, “can you tell me something to\nread?”\n\nRowland stared, at the disconnectedness of the question.\n\n“Can you recommend me some books?” she repeated. “I know you are a great\nreader. I have no one else to ask. We can buy no books. We can make\ndebts for jewelry and bonnets and five-button gloves, but we can’t spend\na sou for ideas. And yet, though you may not believe it, I like ideas\nquite as well.”\n\n“I shall be most happy to lend you some books,” Rowland said. “I will\npick some out to-morrow and send them to you.”\n\n“No novels, please! I am tired of novels. I can imagine better stories\nfor myself than any I read. Some good poetry, if there is such a thing\nnowadays, and some memoirs and histories and books of facts.”\n\n“You shall be served. Your taste agrees with my own.”\n\nShe was silent a moment, looking at him. Then suddenly--“Tell me\nsomething about Mr. Hudson,” she demanded. “You are great friends!”\n\n“Oh yes,” said Rowland; “we are great friends.”\n\n“Tell me about him. Come, begin!”\n\n“Where shall I begin? You know him for yourself.”\n\n“No, I don’t know him; I don’t find him so easy to know. Since he has\nfinished my bust and begun to come here disinterestedly, he has become a\ngreat talker. He says very fine things; but does he mean all he says?”\n\n“Few of us do that.”\n\n“You do, I imagine. You ought to know, for he tells me you discovered\nhim.” Rowland was silent, and Christina continued, “Do you consider him\nvery clever?”\n\n“Unquestionably.”\n\n“His talent is really something out of the common way?”\n\n“So it seems to me.”\n\n“In short, he ‘s a man of genius?”\n\n“Yes, call it genius.”\n\n“And you found him vegetating in a little village and took him by the\nhand and set him on his feet in Rome?”\n\n“Is that the popular legend?” asked Rowland.\n\n“Oh, you need n’t be modest. There was no great merit in it; there\nwould have been none at least on my part in the same circumstances.\nReal geniuses are not so common, and if I had discovered one in the\nwilderness, I would have brought him out into the market-place to see\nhow he would behave. It would be excessively amusing. You must find it\nso to watch Mr. Hudson, eh? Tell me this: do you think he is going to be\na great man--become famous, have his life written, and all that?”\n\n“I don’t prophesy, but I have good hopes.”\n\nChristina was silent. She stretched out her bare arm and looked at it a\nmoment absently, turning it so as to see--or almost to see--the dimple\nin her elbow. This was apparently a frequent gesture with her; Rowland\nhad already observed it. It was as coolly and naturally done as if she\nhad been in her room alone. “So he ‘s a man of genius,” she suddenly\nresumed. “Don’t you think I ought to be extremely flattered to have a\nman of genius perpetually hanging about? He is the first I ever saw,\nbut I should have known he was not a common mortal. There is something\nstrange about him. To begin with, he has no manners. You may say that it\n‘s not for me to blame him, for I have none myself. That ‘s very true,\nbut the difference is that I can have them when I wish to (and very\ncharming ones too; I ‘ll show you some day); whereas Mr. Hudson will\nnever have them. And yet, somehow, one sees he ‘s a gentleman. He seems\nto have something urging, driving, pushing him, making him restless and\ndefiant. You see it in his eyes. They are the finest, by the way, I ever\nsaw. When a person has such eyes as that you can forgive him his bad\nmanners. I suppose that is what they call the sacred fire.”\n\nRowland made no answer except to ask her in a moment if she would have\nanother roll. She merely shook her head and went on:--\n\n“Tell me how you found him. Where was he--how was he?”\n\n“He was in a place called Northampton. Did you ever hear of it? He was\nstudying law--but not learning it.”\n\n“It appears it was something horrible, eh?”\n\n“Something horrible?”\n\n“This little village. No society, no pleasures, no beauty, no life.”\n\n“You have received a false impression. Northampton is not as gay as\nRome, but Roderick had some charming friends.”\n\n“Tell me about them. Who were they?”\n\n“Well, there was my cousin, through whom I made his acquaintance: a\ndelightful woman.”\n\n“Young--pretty?”\n\n“Yes, a good deal of both. And very clever.”\n\n“Did he make love to her?”\n\n“Not in the least.”\n\n“Well, who else?”\n\n“He lived with his mother. She is the best of women.”\n\n“Ah yes, I know all that one’s mother is. But she does not count as\nsociety. And who else?”\n\nRowland hesitated. He wondered whether Christina’s insistence was\nthe result of a general interest in Roderick’s antecedents or of a\nparticular suspicion. He looked at her; she was looking at him a little\naskance, waiting for his answer. As Roderick had said nothing about his\nengagement to the Cavaliere, it was probable that with this beautiful\ngirl he had not been more explicit. And yet the thing was announced, it\nwas public; that other girl was happy in it, proud of it. Rowland felt\na kind of dumb anger rising in his heart. He deliberated a moment\nintently.\n\n“What are you frowning at?” Christina asked.\n\n“There was another person,” he answered, “the most important of all: the\nyoung girl to whom he is engaged.”\n\nChristina stared a moment, raising her eyebrows. “Ah, Mr. Hudson is\nengaged?” she said, very simply. “Is she pretty?”\n\n“She is not called a beauty,” said Rowland. He meant to practice great\nbrevity, but in a moment he added, “I have seen beauties, however, who\npleased me less.”\n\n“Ah, she pleases you, too? Why don’t they marry?”\n\n“Roderick is waiting till he can afford to marry.”\n\nChristina slowly put out her arm again and looked at the dimple in her\nelbow. “Ah, he ‘s engaged?” she repeated in the same tone. “He never\ntold me.”\n\nRowland perceived at this moment that the people about them were\nbeginning to return to the dancing-room, and immediately afterwards\nhe saw Roderick making his way toward themselves. Roderick presented\nhimself before Miss Light.\n\n“I don’t claim that you have promised me the cotillon,” he said, “but I\nconsider that you have given me hopes which warrant the confidence that\nyou will dance with me.”\n\nChristina looked at him a moment. “Certainly I have made no promises,”\n she said. “It seemed to me that, as the daughter of the house, I should\nkeep myself free and let it depend on circumstances.”\n\n“I beseech you to dance with me!” said Roderick, with vehemence.\n\nChristina rose and began to laugh. “You say that very well, but the\nItalians do it better.”\n\nThis assertion seemed likely to be put to the proof. Mrs. Light hastily\napproached, leading, rather than led by, a tall, slim young man, of an\nunmistakably Southern physiognomy. “My precious love,” she cried, “what\na place to hide in! We have been looking for you for twenty minutes; I\nhave chosen a cavalier for you, and chosen well!”\n\nThe young man disengaged himself, made a ceremonious bow, joined his two\nhands, and murmured with an ecstatic smile, “May I venture to hope, dear\nsignorina, for the honor of your hand?”\n\n“Of course you may!” said Mrs. Light. “The honor is for us.”\n\nChristina hesitated but for a moment, then swept the young man a\ncourtesy as profound as his own bow. “You are very kind, but you are too\nlate. I have just accepted!”\n\n“Ah, my own darling!” murmured--almost moaned--Mrs. Light.\n\nChristina and Roderick exchanged a single glance--a glance brilliant on\nboth sides. She passed her hand into his arm; he tossed his clustering\nlocks and led her away.\n\nA short time afterwards Rowland saw the young man whom she had\nrejected leaning against a doorway. He was ugly, but what is called\ndistinguished-looking. He had a heavy black eye, a sallow complexion, a\nlong, thin neck; his hair was cropped en brosse. He looked very young,\nyet extremely bored. He was staring at the ceiling and stroking an\nimperceptible moustache. Rowland espied the Cavaliere Giacosa hard by,\nand, having joined him, asked him the young man’s name.\n\n“Oh,” said the Cavaliere, “he ‘s a pezzo grosso! A Neapolitan. Prince\nCasamassima.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Frascati\n\nOne day, on entering Roderick’s lodging (not the modest rooms on the\nRipetta which he had first occupied, but a much more sumptuous apartment\non the Corso), Rowland found a letter on the table addressed to himself.\nIt was from Roderick, and consisted of but three lines: “I am gone to\nFrascati--for meditation. If I am not at home on Friday, you had\nbetter join me.” On Friday he was still absent, and Rowland went out to\nFrascati. Here he found his friend living at the inn and spending his\ndays, according to his own account, lying under the trees of the Villa\nMondragone, reading Ariosto. He was in a sombre mood; “meditation”\n seemed not to have been fruitful. Nothing especially pertinent to our\nnarrative had passed between the two young men since Mrs. Light’s ball,\nsave a few words bearing on an incident of that entertainment. Rowland\ninformed Roderick, the next day, that he had told Miss Light of his\nengagement. “I don’t know whether you ‘ll thank me,” he had said, “but\nit ‘s my duty to let you know it. Miss Light perhaps has already done\nso.”\n\nRoderick looked at him a moment, intently, with his color slowly\nrising. “Why should n’t I thank you?” he asked. “I am not ashamed of my\nengagement.”\n\n“As you had not spoken of it yourself, I thought you might have a reason\nfor not having it known.”\n\n“A man does n’t gossip about such a matter with strangers,” Roderick\nrejoined, with the ring of irritation in his voice.\n\n“With strangers--no!” said Rowland, smiling.\n\nRoderick continued his work; but after a moment, turning round with a\nfrown: “If you supposed I had a reason for being silent, pray why should\nyou have spoken?”\n\n“I did not speak idly, my dear Roderick. I weighed the matter before I\nspoke, and promised myself to let you know immediately afterwards. It\nseemed to me that Miss Light had better know that your affections are\npledged.”\n\n“The Cavaliere has put it into your head, then, that I am making love to\nher?”\n\n“No; in that case I would not have spoken to her first.”\n\n“Do you mean, then, that she is making love to me?”\n\n“This is what I mean,” said Rowland, after a pause. “That girl finds you\ninteresting, and is pleased, even though she may play indifference,\nat your finding her so. I said to myself that it might save her some\nsentimental disappointment to know without delay that you are not at\nliberty to become indefinitely interested in other women.”\n\n“You seem to have taken the measure of my liberty with extraordinary\nminuteness!” cried Roderick.\n\n“You must do me justice. I am the cause of your separation from Miss\nGarland, the cause of your being exposed to temptations which she hardly\neven suspects. How could I ever face her,” Rowland demanded, with much\nwarmth of tone, “if at the end of it all she should be unhappy?”\n\n“I had no idea that Miss Garland had made such an impression on you.\nYou are too zealous; I take it she did n’t charge you to look after her\ninterests.”\n\n“If anything happens to you, I am accountable. You must understand\nthat.”\n\n“That ‘s a view of the situation I can’t accept; in your own interest,\nno less than in mine. It can only make us both very uncomfortable. I\nknow all I owe you; I feel it; you know that! But I am not a small boy\nnor an outer barbarian any longer, and, whatever I do, I do with my eyes\nopen. When I do well, the merit ‘s mine; if I do ill, the fault ‘s mine!\nThe idea that I make you nervous is detestable. Dedicate your nerves\nto some better cause, and believe that if Miss Garland and I have a\nquarrel, we shall settle it between ourselves.”\n\nRowland had found himself wondering, shortly before, whether possibly\nhis brilliant young friend was without a conscience; now it dimly\noccurred to him that he was without a heart. Rowland, as we have already\nintimated, was a man with a moral passion, and no small part of it had\ngone forth into his relations with Roderick. There had been, from the\nfirst, no protestations of friendship on either side, but Rowland had\nimplicitly offered everything that belongs to friendship, and Roderick\nhad, apparently, as deliberately accepted it. Rowland, indeed, had taken\nan exquisite satisfaction in his companion’s deep, inexpressive assent\nto his interest in him. “Here is an uncommonly fine thing,” he said to\nhimself: “a nature unconsciously grateful, a man in whom friendship does\nthe thing that love alone generally has the credit of--knocks the bottom\nout of pride!” His reflective judgment of Roderick, as time went on, had\nindulged in a great many irrepressible vagaries; but his affection,\nhis sense of something in his companion’s whole personality that\novermastered his heart and beguiled his imagination, had never for an\ninstant faltered. He listened to Roderick’s last words, and then he\nsmiled as he rarely smiled--with bitterness.\n\n“I don’t at all like your telling me I am too zealous,” he said. “If I\nhad not been zealous, I should never have cared a fig for you.”\n\nRoderick flushed deeply, and thrust his modeling tool up to the handle\ninto the clay. “Say it outright! You have been a great fool to believe\nin me.”\n\n“I desire to say nothing of the kind, and you don’t honestly believe I\ndo!” said Rowland. “It seems to me I am really very good-natured even to\nreply to such nonsense.”\n\nRoderick sat down, crossed his arms, and fixed his eyes on the floor.\nRowland looked at him for some moments; it seemed to him that he\nhad never so clearly read his companion’s strangely commingled\ncharacter--his strength and his weakness, his picturesque personal\nattractiveness and his urgent egoism, his exalted ardor and his puerile\npetulance. It would have made him almost sick, however, to think that,\non the whole, Roderick was not a generous fellow, and he was so far from\nhaving ceased to believe in him that he felt just now, more than ever,\nthat all this was but the painful complexity of genius. Rowland, who\nhad not a grain of genius either to make one say he was an interested\nreasoner, or to enable one to feel that he could afford a dangerous\ntheory or two, adhered to his conviction of the essential salubrity of\ngenius. Suddenly he felt an irresistible compassion for his companion;\nit seemed to him that his beautiful faculty of production was a\ndouble-edged instrument, susceptible of being dealt in back-handed blows\nat its possessor. Genius was priceless, inspired, divine; but it was\nalso, at its hours, capricious, sinister, cruel; and men of genius,\naccordingly, were alternately very enviable and very helpless. It was\nnot the first time he had had a sense of Roderick’s standing helpless in\nthe grasp of his temperament. It had shaken him, as yet, but with a half\ngood-humored wantonness; but, henceforth, possibly, it meant to handle\nhim more roughly. These were not times, therefore, for a friend to have\na short patience.\n\n“When you err, you say, the fault ‘s your own,” he said at last. “It is\nbecause your faults are your own that I care about them.”\n\nRowland’s voice, when he spoke with feeling, had an extraordinary\namenity. Roderick sat staring a moment longer at the floor, then he\nsprang up and laid his hand affectionately on his friend’s shoulder.\n“You are the best man in the world,” he said, “and I am a vile brute.\nOnly,” he added in a moment, “you don’t understand me!” And he looked\nat him with eyes of such radiant lucidity that one might have said (and\nRowland did almost say so, himself) that it was the fault of one’s own\ngrossness if one failed to read to the bottom of that beautiful soul.\n\nRowland smiled sadly. “What is it now? Explain.”\n\n“Oh, I can’t explain!” cried Roderick impatiently, returning to his\nwork. “I have only one way of expressing my deepest feelings--it ‘s\nthis!” And he swung his tool. He stood looking at the half-wrought clay\nfor a moment, and then flung the instrument down. “And even this half\nthe time plays me false!”\n\nRowland felt that his irritation had not subsided, and he himself had no\ntaste for saying disagreeable things. Nevertheless he saw no sufficient\nreason to forbear uttering the words he had had on his conscience from\nthe beginning. “We must do what we can and be thankful,” he said. “And\nlet me assure you of this--that it won’t help you to become entangled\nwith Miss Light.”\n\nRoderick pressed his hand to his forehead with vehemence and then shook\nit in the air, despairingly; a gesture that had become frequent with him\nsince he had been in Italy. “No, no, it ‘s no use; you don’t understand\nme! But I don’t blame you. You can’t!”\n\n“You think it will help you, then?” said Rowland, wondering.\n\n“I think that when you expect a man to produce beautiful and wonderful\nworks of art, you ought to allow him a certain freedom of action, you\nought to give him a long rope, you ought to let him follow his fancy and\nlook for his material wherever he thinks he may find it! A mother can’t\nnurse her child unless she follows a certain diet; an artist can’t bring\nhis visions to maturity unless he has a certain experience. You\ndemand of us to be imaginative, and you deny us that which feeds the\nimagination. In labor we must be as passionate as the inspired sibyl; in\nlife we must be mere machines. It won’t do. When you have got an artist\nto deal with, you must take him as he is, good and bad together. I don’t\nsay they are pleasant fellows to know or easy fellows to live with; I\ndon’t say they satisfy themselves any better than other people. I only\nsay that if you want them to produce, you must let them conceive. If\nyou want a bird to sing, you must not cover up its cage. Shoot them, the\npoor devils, drown them, exterminate them, if you will, in the interest\nof public morality; it may be morality would gain--I dare say it would!\nBut if you suffer them to live, let them live on their own terms and\naccording to their own inexorable needs!”\n\nRowland burst out laughing. “I have no wish whatever either to shoot you\nor to drown you!” he said. “Why launch such a tirade against a warning\noffered you altogether in the interest of your freest development?\nDo you really mean that you have an inexorable need of embarking on a\nflirtation with Miss Light?--a flirtation as to the felicity of which\nthere may be differences of opinion, but which cannot at best, under the\ncircumstances, be called innocent. Your last summer’s adventures were\nmore so! As for the terms on which you are to live, I had an idea you\nhad arranged them otherwise!”\n\n“I have arranged nothing--thank God! I don’t pretend to arrange. I\nam young and ardent and inquisitive, and I admire Miss Light. That ‘s\nenough. I shall go as far as admiration leads me. I am not afraid. Your\ngenuine artist may be sometimes half a madman, but he ‘s not a coward!”\n\n“Suppose that in your speculation you should come to grief, not only\nsentimentally but artistically?”\n\n“Come what come will! If I ‘m to fizzle out, the sooner I know it the\nbetter. Sometimes I half suspect it. But let me at least go out and\nreconnoitre for the enemy, and not sit here waiting for him, cudgeling\nmy brains for ideas that won’t come!”\n\nDo what he would, Rowland could not think of Roderick’s theory of\nunlimited experimentation, especially as applied in the case under\ndiscussion, as anything but a pernicious illusion. But he saw it was\nvain to combat longer, for inclination was powerfully on Roderick’s\nside. He laid his hand on Roderick’s shoulder, looked at him a moment\nwith troubled eyes, then shook his head mournfully and turned away.\n\n“I can’t work any more,” said Roderick. “You have upset me! I ‘ll go\nand stroll on the Pincian.” And he tossed aside his working-jacket and\nprepared himself for the street. As he was arranging his cravat before\nthe glass, something occurred to him which made him thoughtful. He\nstopped a few moments afterward, as they were going out, with his hand\non the door-knob. “You did, from your own point of view, an indiscreet\nthing,” he said, “to tell Miss Light of my engagement.”\n\nRowland looked at him with a glance which was partly an interrogation,\nbut partly, also, an admission.\n\n“If she ‘s the coquette you say,” Roderick added, “you have given her a\nreason the more.”\n\n“And that ‘s the girl you propose to devote yourself to?” cried Rowland.\n\n“Oh, I don’t say it, mind! I only say that she ‘s the most interesting\ncreature in the world! The next time you mean to render me a service,\npray give me notice beforehand!”\n\nIt was perfectly characteristic of Roderick that, a fortnight later, he\nshould have let his friend know that he depended upon him for society\nat Frascati, as freely as if no irritating topic had ever been discussed\nbetween them. Rowland thought him generous, and he had at any rate a\nliberal faculty of forgetting that he had given you any reason to be\ndispleased with him. It was equally characteristic of Rowland that he\ncomplied with his friend’s summons without a moment’s hesitation. His\ncousin Cecilia had once told him that he was the dupe of his intense\nbenevolence. She put the case with too little favor, or too much, as the\nreader chooses; it is certain, at least, that he had a constitutional\ntendency towards magnanimous interpretations. Nothing happened, however,\nto suggest to him that he was deluded in thinking that Roderick’s\nsecondary impulses were wiser than his primary ones, and that the\nrounded total of his nature had a harmony perfectly attuned to the most\namiable of its brilliant parts. Roderick’s humor, for the time, was\npitched in a minor key; he was lazy, listless, and melancholy, but he\nhad never been more friendly and kindly and appealingly submissive.\nWinter had begun, by the calendar, but the weather was divinely mild,\nand the two young men took long slow strolls on the hills and lounged\naway the mornings in the villas. The villas at Frascati are delicious\nplaces, and replete with romantic suggestiveness. Roderick, as he\nhad said, was meditating, and if a masterpiece was to come of his\nmeditations, Rowland was perfectly willing to bear him company and coax\nalong the process. But Roderick let him know from the first that he was\nin a miserably sterile mood, and, cudgel his brains as he would, could\nthink of nothing that would serve for the statue he was to make for Mr.\nLeavenworth.\n\n“It is worse out here than in Rome,” he said, “for here I am face to\nface with the dead blank of my mind! There I could n’t think of anything\neither, but there I found things to make me forget that I needed to.”\n This was as frank an allusion to Christina Light as could have been\nexpected under the circumstances; it seemed, indeed, to Rowland\nsurprisingly frank, and a pregnant example of his companion’s often\nstrangely irresponsible way of looking at harmful facts. Roderick\nwas silent sometimes for hours, with a puzzled look on his face and\na constant fold between his even eyebrows; at other times he talked\nunceasingly, with a slow, idle, half-nonsensical drawl. Rowland was half\na dozen times on the point of asking him what was the matter with him;\nhe was afraid he was going to be ill. Roderick had taken a great fancy\nto the Villa Mondragone, and used to declaim fantastic compliments to it\nas they strolled in the winter sunshine on the great terrace which looks\ntoward Tivoli and the iridescent Sabine mountains. He carried his volume\nof Ariosto in his pocket, and took it out every now and then and spouted\nhalf a dozen stanzas to his companion. He was, as a general thing, very\nlittle of a reader; but at intervals he would take a fancy to one of the\nclassics and peruse it for a month in disjointed scraps. He had picked\nup Italian without study, and had a wonderfully sympathetic accent,\nthough in reading aloud he ruined the sense of half the lines he\nrolled off so sonorously. Rowland, who pronounced badly but understood\neverything, once said to him that Ariosto was not the poet for a man of\nhis craft; a sculptor should make a companion of Dante. So he lent him\nthe Inferno, which he had brought with him, and advised him to look into\nit. Roderick took it with some eagerness; perhaps it would brighten\nhis wits. He returned it the next day with disgust; he had found it\nintolerably depressing.\n\n“A sculptor should model as Dante writes--you ‘re right there,” he said.\n“But when his genius is in eclipse, Dante is a dreadfully smoky lamp.\nBy what perversity of fate,” he went on, “has it come about that I am a\nsculptor at all? A sculptor is such a confoundedly special genius; there\nare so few subjects he can treat, so few things in life that bear upon\nhis work, so few moods in which he himself is inclined to it.” (It\nmay be noted that Rowland had heard him a dozen times affirm the flat\nreverse of all this.) “If I had only been a painter--a little quiet,\ndocile, matter-of-fact painter, like our friend Singleton--I should\nonly have to open my Ariosto here to find a subject, to find color and\nattitudes, stuffs and composition; I should only have to look up from\nthe page at that mouldy old fountain against the blue sky, at that\ncypress alley wandering away like a procession of priests in couples,\nat the crags and hollows of the Sabine hills, to find myself grasping\nmy brush. Best of all would be to be Ariosto himself, or one of his\nbrotherhood. Then everything in nature would give you a hint, and every\nform of beauty be part of your stock. You would n’t have to look at\nthings only to say,--with tears of rage half the time,--‘Oh, yes, it\n‘s wonderfully pretty, but what the deuce can I do with it?’ But a\nsculptor, now! That ‘s a pretty trade for a fellow who has got his\nliving to make and yet is so damnably constituted that he can’t work to\norder, and considers that, aesthetically, clock ornaments don’t pay! You\ncan’t model the serge-coated cypresses, nor those mouldering old Tritons\nand all the sunny sadness of that dried-up fountain; you can’t put the\nlight into marble--the lovely, caressing, consenting Italian light that\nyou get so much of for nothing. Say that a dozen times in his life a man\nhas a complete sculpturesque vision--a vision in which the imagination\nrecognizes a subject and the subject kindles the imagination. It is a\nremunerative rate of work, and the intervals are comfortable!”\n\nOne morning, as the two young men were lounging on the sun-warmed\ngrass at the foot of one of the slanting pines of the Villa Mondragone,\nRoderick delivered himself of a tissue of lugubrious speculations as to\nthe possible mischances of one’s genius. “What if the watch should run\ndown,” he asked, “and you should lose the key? What if you should wake\nup some morning and find it stopped, inexorably, appallingly stopped?\nSuch things have been, and the poor devils to whom they happened have\nhad to grin and bear it. The whole matter of genius is a mystery. It\nbloweth where it listeth and we know nothing of its mechanism. If it\ngets out of order we can’t mend it; if it breaks down altogether we\ncan’t set it going again. We must let it choose its own pace, and hold\nour breath lest it should lose its balance. It ‘s dealt out in different\ndoses, in big cups and little, and when you have consumed your portion\nit ‘s as naif to ask for more as it was for Oliver Twist to ask for more\nporridge. Lucky for you if you ‘ve got one of the big cups; we drink\nthem down in the dark, and we can’t tell their size until we tip them\nup and hear the last gurgle. Those of some men last for life; those of\nothers for a couple of years. Nay, what are you smiling at so damnably?”\n he went on. “Nothing is more common than for an artist who has set out\non his journey on a high-stepping horse to find himself all of a sudden\ndismounted and invited to go his way on foot. You can number them by the\nthousand--the people of two or three successes; the poor fellows whose\ncandle burnt out in a night. Some of them groped their way along without\nit, some of them gave themselves up for blind and sat down by the\nwayside to beg. Who shall say that I ‘m not one of these? Who shall\nassure me that my credit is for an unlimited sum? Nothing proves it,\nand I never claimed it; or if I did, I did so in the mere boyish joy of\nshaking off the dust of Northampton. If you believed so, my dear fellow,\nyou did so at your own risk! What am I, what are the best of us, but\nan experiment? Do I succeed--do I fail? It does n’t depend on me. I ‘m\nprepared for failure. It won’t be a disappointment, simply because I\nshan’t survive it. The end of my work shall be the end of my life. When\nI have played my last card, I shall cease to care for the game. I ‘m not\nmaking vulgar threats of suicide; for destiny, I trust, won’t add\ninsult to injury by putting me to that abominable trouble. But I have a\nconviction that if the hour strikes here,” and he tapped his forehead,\n“I shall disappear, dissolve, be carried off in a cloud! For the past\nten days I have had the vision of some such fate perpetually swimming\nbefore my eyes. My mind is like a dead calm in the tropics, and my\nimagination as motionless as the phantom ship in the Ancient Mariner!”\n\nRowland listened to this outbreak, as he often had occasion to listen to\nRoderick’s heated monologues, with a number of mental restrictions. Both\nin gravity and in gayety he said more than he meant, and you did him\nsimple justice if you privately concluded that neither the glow of\npurpose nor the chill of despair was of so intense a character as his\nflorid diction implied. The moods of an artist, his exaltations\nand depressions, Rowland had often said to himself, were like the\npen-flourishes a writing-master makes in the air when he begins to set\nhis copy. He may bespatter you with ink, he may hit you in the eye, but\nhe writes a magnificent hand. It was nevertheless true that at present\npoor Roderick gave unprecedented tokens of moral stagnation, and as for\ngenius being held by the precarious tenure he had sketched, Rowland was\nat a loss to see whence he could borrow the authority to contradict him.\nHe sighed to himself, and wished that his companion had a trifle more\nof little Sam Singleton’s evenness of impulse. But then, was Singleton\na man of genius? He answered that such reflections seemed to him\nunprofitable, not to say morbid; that the proof of the pudding was\nin the eating; that he did n’t know about bringing a genius that had\npalpably spent its last breath back to life again, but that he was\nsatisfied that vigorous effort was a cure for a great many ills that\nseemed far gone. “Don’t heed your mood,” he said, “and don’t believe\nthere is any calm so dead that your own lungs can’t ruffle it with a\nbreeze. If you have work to do, don’t wait to feel like it; set to work\nand you will feel like it.”\n\n“Set to work and produce abortions!” cried Roderick with ire. “Preach\nthat to others. Production with me must be either pleasure or nothing.\nAs I said just now, I must either stay in the saddle or not go at all.\nI won’t do second-rate work; I can’t if I would. I have no cleverness,\napart from inspiration. I am not a Gloriani! You are right,” he added\nafter a while; “this is unprofitable talk, and it makes my head ache. I\nshall take a nap and see if I can dream of a bright idea or two.”\n\nHe turned his face upward to the parasol of the great pine, closed his\neyes, and in a short time forgot his sombre fancies. January though it\nwas, the mild stillness seemed to vibrate with faint midsummer sounds.\nRowland sat listening to them and wishing that, for the sake of his own\nfelicity, Roderick’s temper were graced with a certain absent ductility.\nHe was brilliant, but was he, like many brilliant things, brittle?\nSuddenly, to his musing sense, the soft atmospheric hum was overscored\nwith distincter sounds. He heard voices beyond a mass of shrubbery, at\nthe turn of a neighboring path. In a moment one of them began to seem\nfamiliar, and an instant later a large white poodle emerged into view.\nHe was slowly followed by his mistress. Miss Light paused a moment on\nseeing Rowland and his companion; but, though the former perceived that\nhe was recognized, she made no bow. Presently she walked directly toward\nhim. He rose and was on the point of waking Roderick, but she laid\nher finger on her lips and motioned him to forbear. She stood a moment\nlooking at Roderick’s handsome slumber.\n\n“What delicious oblivion!” she said. “Happy man! Stenterello”--and she\npointed to his face--“wake him up!”\n\nThe poodle extended a long pink tongue and began to lick Roderick’s\ncheek.\n\n“Why,” asked Rowland, “if he is happy?”\n\n“Oh, I want companions in misery! Besides, I want to show off my dog.”\n Roderick roused himself, sat up, and stared. By this time Mrs. Light had\napproached, walking with a gentleman on each side of her. One of these\nwas the Cavaliere Giacosa; the other was Prince Casamassima. “I should\nhave liked to lie down on the grass and go to sleep,” Christina added.\n“But it would have been unheard of.”\n\n“Oh, not quite,” said the Prince, in English, with a tone of great\nprecision. “There was already a Sleeping Beauty in the Wood!”\n\n“Charming!” cried Mrs. Light. “Do you hear that, my dear?”\n\n“When the prince says a brilliant thing, it would be a pity to lose it,”\n said the young girl. “Your servant, sir!” And she smiled at him with a\ngrace that might have reassured him, if he had thought her compliment\nambiguous.\n\nRoderick meanwhile had risen to his feet, and Mrs. Light began to\nexclaim on the oddity of their meeting and to explain that the day was\nso lovely that she had been charmed with the idea of spending it in the\ncountry. And who would ever have thought of finding Mr. Mallet and Mr.\nHudson sleeping under a tree!\n\n“Oh, I beg your pardon; I was not sleeping,” said Rowland.\n\n“Don’t you know that Mr. Mallet is Mr. Hudson’s sheep-dog?” asked\nChristina. “He was mounting guard to keep away the wolves.”\n\n“To indifferent purpose, madame!” said Rowland, indicating the young\ngirl.\n\n“Is that the way you spend your time?” Christina demanded of Roderick.\n“I never yet happened to learn what men were doing when they supposed\nwomen were not watching them but it was something vastly below their\nreputation.”\n\n“When, pray,” said Roderick, smoothing his ruffled locks, “are women not\nwatching them?”\n\n“We shall give you something better to do, at any rate. How long have\nyou been here? It ‘s an age since I have seen you. We consider you\ndomiciled here, and expect you to play host and entertain us.”\n\nRoderick said that he could offer them nothing but to show them the\ngreat terrace, with its view; and ten minutes later the group was\nassembled there. Mrs. Light was extravagant in her satisfaction;\nChristina looked away at the Sabine mountains, in silence. The prince\nstood by, frowning at the rapture of the elder lady.\n\n“This is nothing,” he said at last. “My word of honor. Have you seen the\nterrace at San Gaetano?”\n\n“Ah, that terrace,” murmured Mrs. Light, amorously. “I suppose it is\nmagnificent!”\n\n“It is four hundred feet long, and paved with marble. And the view is\na thousand times more beautiful than this. You see, far away, the blue,\nblue sea and the little smoke of Vesuvio!”\n\n“Christina, love,” cried Mrs. Light forthwith, “the prince has a terrace\nfour hundred feet long, all paved with marble!”\n\nThe Cavaliere gave a little cough and began to wipe his eye-glass.\n\n“Stupendous!” said Christina. “To go from one end to the other, the\nprince must have out his golden carriage.” This was apparently an\nallusion to one of the other items of the young man’s grandeur.\n\n“You always laugh at me,” said the prince. “I know no more what to say!”\n\nShe looked at him with a sad smile and shook her head. “No, no, dear\nprince, I don’t laugh at you. Heaven forbid! You are much too serious an\naffair. I assure you I feel your importance. What did you inform us was\nthe value of the hereditary diamonds of the Princess Casamassima?”\n\n“Ah, you are laughing at me yet!” said the poor young man, standing\nrigid and pale.\n\n“It does n’t matter,” Christina went on. “We have a note of it; mamma\nwrites all those things down in a little book!”\n\n“If you are laughed at, dear prince, at least it ‘s in company,” said\nMrs. Light, caressingly; and she took his arm, as if to resist his\npossible displacement under the shock of her daughter’s sarcasm. But the\nprince looked heavy-eyed toward Rowland and Roderick, to whom the\nyoung girl was turning, as if he had much rather his lot were cast with\ntheirs.\n\n“Is the villa inhabited?” Christina asked, pointing to the vast\nmelancholy structure which rises above the terrace.\n\n“Not privately,” said Roderick. “It is occupied by a Jesuits’ college,\nfor little boys.”\n\n“Can women go in?”\n\n“I am afraid not.” And Roderick began to laugh. “Fancy the poor little\ndevils looking up from their Latin declensions and seeing Miss Light\nstanding there!”\n\n“I should like to see the poor little devils, with their rosy cheeks and\ntheir long black gowns, and when they were pretty, I should n’t scruple\nto kiss them. But if I can’t have that amusement I must have some other.\nWe must not stand planted on this enchanting terrace as if we were\nstakes driven into the earth. We must dance, we must feast, we must do\nsomething picturesque. Mamma has arranged, I believe, that we are to go\nback to Frascati to lunch at the inn. I decree that we lunch here and\nsend the Cavaliere to the inn to get the provisions! He can take the\ncarriage, which is waiting below.”\n\nMiss Light carried out this undertaking with unfaltering ardor. The\nCavaliere was summoned, and he stook to receive her commands hat in\nhand, with his eyes cast down, as if she had been a princess addressing\nher major-domo. She, however, laid her hand with friendly grace upon his\nbutton-hole, and called him a dear, good old Cavaliere, for being always\nso willing. Her spirits had risen with the occasion, and she talked\nirresistible nonsense. “Bring the best they have,” she said, “no matter\nif it ruins us! And if the best is very bad, it will be all the\nmore amusing. I shall enjoy seeing Mr. Mallet try to swallow it for\npropriety’s sake! Mr. Hudson will say out like a man that it ‘s horrible\nstuff, and that he ‘ll be choked first! Be sure you bring a dish of\nmaccaroni; the prince must have the diet of the Neapolitan nobility. But\nI leave all that to you, my poor, dear Cavaliere; you know what ‘s good!\nOnly be sure, above all, you bring a guitar. Mr. Mallet will play us\na tune, I ‘ll dance with Mr. Hudson, and mamma will pair off with the\nprince, of whom she is so fond!”\n\nAnd as she concluded her recommendations, she patted her bland old\nservitor caressingly on the shoulder. He looked askance at Rowland; his\nlittle black eye glittered; it seemed to say, “Did n’t I tell you she\nwas a good girl!”\n\nThe Cavaliere returned with zealous speed, accompanied by one of the\nservants of the inn, laden with a basket containing the materials of a\nrustic luncheon. The porter of the villa was easily induced to furnish\na table and half a dozen chairs, and the repast, when set forth, was\npronounced a perfect success; not so good as to fail of the proper\npicturesqueness, nor yet so bad as to defeat the proper function of\nrepasts. Christina continued to display the most charming animation,\nand compelled Rowland to reflect privately that, think what one might\nof her, the harmonious gayety of a beautiful girl was the most beautiful\nsight in nature. Her good-humor was contagious. Roderick, who an hour\nbefore had been descanting on madness and suicide, commingled his\nlaughter with hers in ardent devotion; Prince Casamassima stroked\nhis young moustache and found a fine, cool smile for everything; his\nneighbor, Mrs. Light, who had Rowland on the other side, made the\nfriendliest confidences to each of the young men, and the Cavaliere\ncontributed to the general hilarity by the solemnity of his attention\nto his plate. As for Rowland, the spirit of kindly mirth prompted him to\npropose the health of this useful old gentleman, as the effective author\nof their pleasure. A moment later he wished he had held his tongue, for\nalthough the toast was drunk with demonstrative good-will, the Cavaliere\nreceived it with various small signs of eager self-effacement which\nsuggested to Rowland that his diminished gentility but half relished\nhonors which had a flavor of patronage. To perform punctiliously his\nmysterious duties toward the two ladies, and to elude or to baffle\nobservation on his own merits--this seemed the Cavaliere’s modest\nprogramme. Rowland perceived that Mrs. Light, who was not always\nremarkable for tact, seemed to have divined his humor on this point.\nShe touched her glass to her lips, but offered him no compliment and\nimmediately gave another direction to the conversation. He had brought\nno guitar, so that when the feast was over there was nothing to hold the\nlittle group together. Christina wandered away with Roderick to another\npart of the terrace; the prince, whose smile had vanished, sat gnawing\nthe head of his cane, near Mrs. Light, and Rowland strolled apart\nwith the Cavaliere, to whom he wished to address a friendly word in\ncompensation for the discomfort he had inflicted on his modesty. The\nCavaliere was a mine of information upon all Roman places and people;\nhe told Rowland a number of curious anecdotes about the old Villa\nMondragone. “If history could always be taught in this fashion!” thought\nRowland. “It ‘s the ideal--strolling up and down on the very spot\ncommemorated, hearing sympathetic anecdotes from deeply indigenous\nlips.” At last, as they passed, Rowland observed the mournful\nphysiognomy of Prince Casamassima, and, glancing toward the other end of\nthe terrace, saw that Roderick and Christina had disappeared from view.\nThe young man was sitting upright, in an attitude, apparently habitual,\nof ceremonious rigidity; but his lower jaw had fallen and was propped\nup with his cane, and his dull dark eye was fixed upon the angle of the\nvilla which had just eclipsed Miss Light and her companion. His features\nwere grotesque and his expression vacuous; but there was a lurking\ndelicacy in his face which seemed to tell you that nature had been\nmaking Casamassimas for a great many centuries, and, though she adapted\nher mould to circumstances, had learned to mix her material to an\nextraordinary fineness and to perform the whole operation with extreme\nsmoothness. The prince was stupid, Rowland suspected, but he imagined\nhe was amiable, and he saw that at any rate he had the great quality\nof regarding himself in a thoroughly serious light. Rowland touched his\ncompanion’s arm and pointed to the melancholy nobleman.\n\n“Why in the world does he not go after her and insist on being noticed!”\n he asked.\n\n“Oh, he ‘s very proud!” said the Cavaliere.\n\n“That ‘s all very well, but a gentleman who cultivates a passion for\nthat young lady must be prepared to make sacrifices.”\n\n“He thinks he has already made a great many. He comes of a very great\nfamily--a race of princes who for six hundred years have married none\nbut the daughters of princes. But he is seriously in love, and he would\nmarry her to-morrow.”\n\n“And she will not have him?”\n\n“Ah, she is very proud, too!” The Cavaliere was silent a moment, as if\nhe were measuring the propriety of frankness. He seemed to have formed\na high opinion of Rowland’s discretion, for he presently continued:\n“It would be a great match, for she brings him neither a name nor a\nfortune--nothing but her beauty. But the signorina will receive no\nfavors; I know her well! She would rather have her beauty blasted than\nseem to care about the marriage, and if she ever accepts the prince it\nwill be only after he has implored her on his knees!”\n\n“But she does care about it,” said Rowland, “and to bring him to his\nknees she is working upon his jealousy by pretending to be interested in\nmy friend Hudson. If you said more, you would say that, eh?”\n\nThe Cavaliere’s shrewdness exchanged a glance with Rowland’s. “By no\nmeans. Miss Light is a singular girl; she has many romantic ideas.\nShe would be quite capable of interesting herself seriously in an\ninteresting young man, like your friend, and doing her utmost to\ndiscourage a splendid suitor, like the prince. She would act sincerely\nand she would go very far. But it would be unfortunate for the young\nman,” he added, after a pause, “for at the last she would retreat!”\n\n“A singular girl, indeed!”\n\n“She would accept the more brilliant parti. I can answer for it.”\n\n“And what would be her motive?”\n\n“She would be forced. There would be circumstances.... I can’t tell you\nmore.”\n\n“But this implies that the rejected suitor would also come back. He\nmight grow tired of waiting.”\n\n“Oh, this one is good! Look at him now.” Rowland looked, and saw that\nthe prince had left his place by Mrs. Light and was marching restlessly\nto and fro between the villa and the parapet of the terrace. Every now\nand then he looked at his watch. “In this country, you know,” said the\nCavaliere, “a young lady never goes walking alone with a handsome young\nman. It seems to him very strange.”\n\n“It must seem to him monstrous, and if he overlooks it he must be very\nmuch in love.”\n\n“Oh, he will overlook it. He is far gone.”\n\n“Who is this exemplary lover, then; what is he?”\n\n“A Neapolitan; one of the oldest houses in Italy. He is a prince in your\nEnglish sense of the word, for he has a princely fortune. He is very\nyoung; he is only just of age; he saw the signorina last winter\nin Naples. He fell in love with her from the first, but his family\ninterfered, and an old uncle, an ecclesiastic, Monsignor B----, hurried\nup to Naples, seized him, and locked him up. Meantime he has passed his\nmajority, and he can dispose of himself. His relations are moving heaven\nand earth to prevent his marrying Miss Light, and they have sent us\nword that he forfeits his property if he takes his wife out of a certain\nline. I have investigated the question minutely, and I find this is but\na fiction to frighten us. He is perfectly free; but the estates are\nsuch that it is no wonder they wish to keep them in their own hands. For\nItaly, it is an extraordinary case of unincumbered property. The prince\nhas been an orphan from his third year; he has therefore had a long\nminority and made no inroads upon his fortune. Besides, he is very\nprudent and orderly; I am only afraid that some day he will pull the\npurse-strings too tight. All these years his affairs have been in the\nhands of Monsignor B----, who has managed them to perfection--paid off\nmortagages, planted forests, opened up mines. It is now a magnificent\nfortune; such a fortune as, with his name, would justify the young man\nin pretending to any alliance whatsoever. And he lays it all at the feet\nof that young girl who is wandering in yonder boschetto with a penniless\nartist.”\n\n“He is certainly a phoenix of princes! The signora must be in a state of\nbliss.”\n\nThe Cavaliere looked imperturbably grave. “The signora has a high esteem\nfor his character.”\n\n“His character, by the way,” rejoined Rowland, with a smile; “what sort\nof a character is it?”\n\n“Eh, Prince Casamassima is a veritable prince! He is a very good young\nman. He is not brilliant, nor witty, but he ‘ll not let himself be made\na fool of. He ‘s very grave and very devout--though he does propose to\nmarry a Protestant. He will handle that point after marriage. He ‘s as\nyou see him there: a young man without many ideas, but with a very firm\ngrasp of a single one--the conviction that Prince Casamassima is a very\ngreat person, that he greatly honors any young lady by asking for her\nhand, and that things are going very strangely when the young lady\nturns her back upon him. The poor young man, I am sure, is profoundly\nperplexed. But I whisper to him every day, ‘Pazienza, Signor Principe!’”\n\n“So you firmly believe,” said Rowland, in conclusion, “that Miss Light\nwill accept him just in time not to lose him!”\n\n“I count upon it. She would make too perfect a princess to miss her\ndestiny.”\n\n“And you hold that nevertheless, in the mean while, in listening to,\nsay, my friend Hudson, she will have been acting in good faith?”\n\nThe Cavaliere lifted his shoulders a trifle, and gave an inscrutable\nsmile. “Eh, dear signore, the Christina is very romantic!”\n\n“So much so, you intimate, that she will eventually retract, in\nconsequence not of a change of sentiment, but of a mysterious outward\npressure?”\n\n“If everything else fails, there is that resource. But it is mysterious,\nas you say, and you need n’t try to guess it. You will never know.”\n\n“The poor signorina, then, will suffer!”\n\n“Not too much, I hope.”\n\n“And the poor young man! You maintain that there is nothing but\ndisappointment in store for the infatuated youth who loses his heart to\nher!”\n\nThe Cavaliere hesitated. “He had better,” he said in a moment, “go and\npursue his studies in Florence. There are very fine antiques in the\nUffizi!”\n\nRowland presently joined Mrs. Light, to whom her restless protege had\nnot yet returned. “That ‘s right,” she said; “sit down here; I have\nsomething serious to say to you. I am going to talk to you as a friend.\nI want your assistance. In fact, I demand it; it ‘s your duty to render\nit. Look at that unhappy young man.”\n\n“Yes,” said Rowland, “he seems unhappy.”\n\n“He is just come of age, he bears one of the greatest names in Italy and\nowns one of the greatest properties, and he is pining away with love for\nmy daughter.”\n\n“So the Cavaliere tells me.”\n\n“The Cavaliere should n’t gossip,” said Mrs. Light dryly. “Such\ninformation should come from me. The prince is pining, as I say; he ‘s\nconsumed, he ‘s devoured. It ‘s a real Italian passion; I know what that\nmeans!” And the lady gave a speaking glance, which seemed to coquet\nfor a moment with retrospect. “Meanwhile, if you please, my daughter is\nhiding in the woods with your dear friend Mr. Hudson. I could cry with\nrage.”\n\n“If things are so bad as that,” said Rowland, “it seems to me that you\nought to find nothing easier than to dispatch the Cavaliere to bring the\nguilty couple back.”\n\n“Never in the world! My hands are tied. Do you know what Christina\nwould do? She would tell the Cavaliere to go about his business--Heaven\nforgive her!--and send me word that, if she had a mind to, she would\nwalk in the woods till midnight. Fancy the Cavaliere coming back and\ndelivering such a message as that before the prince! Think of a girl\nwantonly making light of such a chance as hers! He would marry her\nto-morrow, at six o’clock in the morning!”\n\n“It is certainly very sad,” said Rowland.\n\n“That costs you little to say. If you had left your precious young\nmeddler to vegetate in his native village you would have saved me a\nworld of distress!”\n\n“Nay, you marched into the jaws of danger,” said Rowland. “You came and\ndisinterred poor Hudson in his own secluded studio.”\n\n“In an evil hour! I wish to Heaven you would talk with him.”\n\n“I have done my best.”\n\n“I wish, then, you would take him away. You have plenty of money. Do me\na favor. Take him to travel. Go to the East--go to Timbuctoo. Then, when\nChristina is Princess Casamassima,” Mrs. Light added in a moment, “he\nmay come back if he chooses.”\n\n“Does she really care for him?” Rowland asked, abruptly.\n\n“She thinks she does, possibly. She is a living riddle. She must needs\nfollow out every idea that comes into her head. Fortunately, most of\nthem don’t last long; but this one may last long enough to give the\nprince a chill. If that were to happen, I don’t know what I should do! I\nshould be the most miserable of women. It would be too cruel, after\nall I ‘ve suffered to make her what she is, to see the labor of years\nblighted by a caprice. For I can assure you, sir,” Mrs. Light went on,\n“that if my daughter is the greatest beauty in the world, some of the\ncredit is mine.”\n\nRowland promptly remarked that this was obvious. He saw that the lady’s\nirritated nerves demanded comfort from flattering reminiscence, and\nhe assumed designedly the attitude of a zealous auditor. She began\nto retail her efforts, her hopes, her dreams, her presentiments, her\ndisappointments, in the cause of her daughter’s matrimonial fortunes. It\nwas a long story, and while it was being unfolded, the prince continued\nto pass to and fro, stiffly and solemnly, like a pendulum marking\nthe time allowed for the young lady to come to her senses. Mrs. Light\nevidently, at an early period, had gathered her maternal hopes into\na sacred sheaf, which she said her prayers and burnt incense to, and\ntreated like a sort of fetish. They had been her religion; she had none\nother, and she performed her devotions bravely and cheerily, in the\nlight of day. The poor old fetish had been so caressed and manipulated,\nso thrust in and out of its niche, so passed from hand to hand, so\ndressed and undressed, so mumbled and fumbled over, that it had lost by\nthis time much of its early freshness, and seemed a rather battered\nand disfeatured divinity. But it was still brought forth in moments of\ntrouble to have its tinseled petticoat twisted about and be set up\non its altar. Rowland observed that Mrs. Light had a genuine maternal\nconscience; she considered that she had been performing a sacred duty in\nbringing up Christina to set her cap for a prince, and when the future\nlooked dark, she found consolation in thinking that destiny could never\nhave the heart to deal a blow at so deserving a person. This conscience\nupside down presented to Rowland’s fancy a real physical image; he was\non the point, half a dozen times, of bursting out laughing.\n\n“I don’t know whether you believe in presentiments,” said Mrs. Light,\n“and I don’t care! I have had one for the last fifteen years. People\nhave laughed at it, but they have n’t laughed me out of it. It has been\neverything to me. I could n’t have lived without it. One must believe in\nsomething! It came to me in a flash, when Christina was five years old.\nI remember the day and the place, as if it were yesterday. She was a\nvery ugly baby; for the first two years I could hardly bear to look at\nher, and I used to spoil my own looks with crying about her. She had an\nItalian nurse who was very fond of her and insisted that she would grow\nup pretty. I could n’t believe her; I used to contradict her, and we\nwere forever squabbling. I was just a little silly in those days--surely\nI may say it now--and I was very fond of being amused. If my daughter\nwas ugly, it was not that she resembled her mamma; I had no lack of\namusement. People accused me, I believe, of neglecting my little girl;\nif it was so, I ‘ve made up for it since. One day I went to drive on the\nPincio in very low spirits. A trusted friend had greatly disappointed\nme. While I was there he passed me in a carriage, driving with a\nhorrible woman who had made trouble between us. I got out of my carriage\nto walk about, and at last sat down on a bench. I can show you the spot\nat this hour. While I sat there a child came wandering along the path--a\nlittle girl of four or five, very fantastically dressed in crimson and\norange. She stopped in front of me and stared at me, and I stared at her\nqueer little dress, which was a cheap imitation of the costume of one\nof these contadine. At last I looked up at her face, and said to myself,\n‘Bless me, what a beautiful child! what a splendid pair of eyes, what a\nmagnificent head of hair! If my poor Christina were only like that!’ The\nchild turned away slowly, but looking back with its eyes fixed on me.\nAll of a sudden I gave a cry, pounced on it, pressed it in my arms,\nand covered it with kisses. It was Christina, my own precious child, so\ndisguised by the ridiculous dress which the nurse had amused herself in\nmaking for her, that her own mother had not recognized her. She knew me,\nbut she said afterwards that she had not spoken to me because I looked\nso angry. Of course my face was sad. I rushed with my child to the\ncarriage, drove home post-haste, pulled off her rags, and, as I may say,\nwrapped her in cotton. I had been blind, I had been insane; she was\na creature in ten millions, she was to be a beauty of beauties, a\npriceless treasure! Every day, after that, the certainty grew. From that\ntime I lived only for my daughter. I watched her, I caressed her from\nmorning till night, I worshipped her. I went to see doctors about her,\nI took every sort of advice. I was determined she should be perfection.\nThe things that have been done for that girl, sir--you would n’t believe\nthem; they would make you smile! Nothing was spared; if I had been told\nthat she must have a bath every morning of molten pearls, I would have\nfound means to give it to her. She never raised a finger for herself,\nshe breathed nothing but perfumes, she walked upon velvet. She never\nwas out of my sight, and from that day to this I have never said a sharp\nword to her. By the time she was ten years old she was beautiful as an\nangel, and so noticed wherever we went that I had to make her wear a\nveil, like a woman of twenty. Her hair reached down to her feet; her\nhands were the hands of a princess. Then I saw that she was as clever\nas she was beautiful, and that she had only to play her cards. She had\nmasters, professors, every educational advantage. They told me she was\na little prodigy. She speaks French, Italian, German, better than\nmost natives. She has a wonderful genius for music, and might make her\nfortune as a pianist, if it was not made for her otherwise! I traveled\nall over Europe; every one told me she was a marvel. The director of the\nopera in Paris saw her dance at a child’s party at Spa, and offered\nme an enormous sum if I would give her up to him and let him have her\neducated for the ballet. I said, ‘No, I thank you, sir; she is meant\nto be something finer than a princesse de theatre.’ I had a passionate\nbelief that she might marry absolutely whom she chose, that she might be\na princess out and out. It has never left me till this hour, and I can\nassure you that it has sustained me in many embarrassments. Financial,\nsome of them; I don’t mind confessing it! I have raised money on that\ngirl’s face! I ‘ve taken her to the Jews and bade her put up her veil,\nand asked if the mother of that young lady was not safe! She, of course,\nwas too young to understand me. And yet, as a child, you would have said\nshe knew what was in store for her; before she could read, she had the\nmanners, the tastes, the instincts of a little princess. She would have\nnothing to do with shabby things or shabby people; if she stained one of\nher frocks, she was seized with a kind of frenzy and tore it to pieces.\nAt Nice, at Baden, at Brighton, wherever we stayed, she used to be sent\nfor by all the great people to play with their children. She has played\nat kissing-games with people who now stand on the steps of thrones! I\nhave gone so far as to think at times that those childish kisses were a\nsign--a symbol--a portent. You may laugh at me if you like, but have n’t\nsuch things happened again and again without half as good a cause, and\ndoes n’t history notoriously repeat itself? There was a little Spanish\ngirl at a second-rate English boarding-school thirty years ago!... The\nEmpress certainly is a pretty woman; but what is my Christina, pray? I\n‘ve dreamt of it, sometimes every night for a month. I won’t tell you\nI have been to consult those old women who advertise in the newspapers;\nyou ‘ll call me an old imbecile. Imbecile if you please! I have refused\nmagnificent offers because I believed that somehow or other--if wars and\nrevolutions were needed to bring it about--we should have nothing less\nthan that. There might be another coup d’etat somewhere, and another\nbrilliant young sovereign looking out for a wife! At last, however,”\n Mrs. Light proceeded with incomparable gravity, “since the overturning\nof the poor king of Naples and that charming queen, and the expulsion\nof all those dear little old-fashioned Italian grand-dukes, and the\ndreadful radical talk that is going on all over the world, it has come\nto seem to me that with Christina in such a position I should be really\nvery nervous. Even in such a position she would hold her head very high,\nand if anything should happen to her, she would make no concessions\nto the popular fury. The best thing, if one is prudent, seems to be a\nnobleman of the highest possible rank, short of belonging to a reigning\nstock. There you see one striding up and down, looking at his watch, and\ncounting the minutes till my daughter reappears!”\n\nRowland listened to all this with a huge compassion for the heroine of\nthe tale. What an education, what a history, what a school of character\nand of morals! He looked at the prince and wondered whether he too had\nheard Mrs. Light’s story. If he had he was a brave man. “I certainly\nhope you ‘ll keep him,” he said to Mrs. Light. “You have played a\ndangerous game with your daughter; it would be a pity not to win. But\nthere is hope for you yet; here she comes at last!”\n\nChristina reappeared as he spoke these words, strolling beside her\ncompanion with the same indifferent tread with which she had departed.\nRowland imagined that there was a faint pink flush in her cheek which\nshe had not carried away with her, and there was certainly a light in\nRoderick’s eyes which he had not seen there for a week.\n\n“Bless my soul, how they are all looking at us!” she cried, as they\nadvanced. “One would think we were prisoners of the Inquisition!” And\nshe paused and glanced from the prince to her mother, and from\nRowland to the Cavaliere, and then threw back her head and burst into\nfar-ringing laughter. “What is it, pray? Have I been very improper? Am I\nruined forever? Dear prince, you are looking at me as if I had committed\nthe unpardonable sin!”\n\n“I myself,” said the prince, “would never have ventured to ask you to\nwalk with me alone in the country for an hour!”\n\n“The more fool you, dear prince, as the vulgar say! Our walk has been\ncharming. I hope you, on your side, have enjoyed each other’s society.”\n\n“My dear daughter,” said Mrs. Light, taking the arm of her predestined\nson-in-law, “I shall have something serious to say to you when we reach\nhome. We will go back to the carriage.”\n\n“Something serious! Decidedly, it is the Inquisition. Mr. Hudson,\nstand firm, and let us agree to make no confessions without conferring\npreviously with each other! They may put us on the rack first. Mr.\nMallet, I see also,” Christina added, “has something serious to say to\nme!”\n\nRowland had been looking at her with the shadow of his lately-stirred\npity in his eyes. “Possibly,” he said. “But it must be for some other\ntime.”\n\n“I am at your service. I see our good-humor is gone. And I only wanted\nto be amiable! It is very discouraging. Cavaliere, you, only, look as if\nyou had a little of the milk of human kindness left; from your venerable\nvisage, at least; there is no telling what you think. Give me your arm\nand take me away!”\n\nThe party took its course back to the carriage, which was waiting in\nthe grounds of the villa, and Rowland and Roderick bade their friends\nfarewell. Christina threw herself back in her seat and closed her eyes;\na manoeuvre for which Rowland imagined the prince was grateful, as it\nenabled him to look at her without seeming to depart from his attitude\nof distinguished disapproval. Rowland found himself aroused from sleep\nearly the next morning, to see Roderick standing before him, dressed for\ndeparture, with his bag in his hand. “I am off,” he said. “I am back to\nwork. I have an idea. I must strike while the iron ‘s hot! Farewell!”\n And he departed by the first train. Rowland went alone by the next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Saint Cecilia’s\n\nRowland went often to the Coliseum; he never wearied of it. One morning,\nabout a month after his return from Frascati, as he was strolling across\nthe vast arena, he observed a young woman seated on one of the fragments\nof stone which are ranged along the line of the ancient parapet. It\nseemed to him that he had seen her before, but he was unable to localize\nher face. Passing her again, he perceived that one of the little\nred-legged French soldiers at that time on guard there had approached\nher and was gallantly making himself agreeable. She smiled brilliantly,\nand Rowland recognized the smile (it had always pleased him) of a\ncertain comely Assunta, who sometimes opened the door for Mrs. Light’s\nvisitors. He wondered what she was doing alone in the Coliseum, and\nconjectured that Assunta had admirers as well as her young mistress, but\nthat, being without the same domiciliary conveniencies, she was using\nthis massive heritage of her Latin ancestors as a boudoir. In other\nwords, she had an appointment with her lover, who had better, from\npresent appearances, be punctual. It was a long time since Rowland had\nascended to the ruinous upper tiers of the great circus, and, as the day\nwas radiant and the distant views promised to be particularly clear,\nhe determined to give himself the pleasure. The custodian unlocked the\ngreat wooden wicket, and he climbed through the winding shafts, where\nthe eager Roman crowds had billowed and trampled, not pausing till he\nreached the highest accessible point of the ruin. The views were as fine\nas he had supposed; the lights on the Sabine Mountains had never been\nmore lovely. He gazed to his satisfaction and retraced his steps. In\na moment he paused again on an abutment somewhat lower, from which\nthe glance dropped dizzily into the interior. There are chance\nanfractuosities of ruin in the upper portions of the Coliseum which\noffer a very fair imitation of the rugged face of an Alpine cliff. In\nthose days a multitude of delicate flowers and sprays of wild herbage\nhad found a friendly soil in the hoary crevices, and they bloomed and\nnodded amid the antique masonry as freely as they would have done in the\nvirgin rock. Rowland was turning away, when he heard a sound of voices\nrising up from below. He had but to step slightly forward to find\nhimself overlooking two persons who had seated themselves on a narrow\nledge, in a sunny corner. They had apparently had an eye to extreme\nprivacy, but they had not observed that their position was commanded by\nRowland’s stand-point. One of these airy adventurers was a lady, thickly\nveiled, so that, even if he had not been standing directly above her,\nRowland could not have seen her face. The other was a young man, whose\nface was also invisible, but who, as Rowland stood there, gave a toss\nof his clustering locks which was equivalent to the signature--Roderick\nHudson. A moment’s reflection, hereupon, satisfied him of the identity\nof the lady. He had been unjust to poor Assunta, sitting patient in the\ngloomy arena; she had not come on her own errand. Rowland’s discoveries\nmade him hesitate. Should he retire as noiselessly as possible, or\nshould he call out a friendly good morning? While he was debating the\nquestion, he found himself distinctly hearing his friends’ words. They\nwere of such a nature as to make him unwilling to retreat, and yet\nto make it awkward to be discovered in a position where it would be\napparent that he had heard them.\n\n“If what you say is true,” said Christina, with her usual soft\ndeliberateness--it made her words rise with peculiar distinctness to\nRowland’s ear--“you are simply weak. I am sorry! I hoped--I really\nbelieved--you were not.”\n\n“No, I am not weak,” answered Roderick, with vehemence; “I maintain that\nI am not weak! I am incomplete, perhaps; but I can’t help that. Weakness\nis a man’s own fault!”\n\n“Incomplete, then!” said Christina, with a laugh. “It ‘s the same thing,\nso long as it keeps you from splendid achievement. Is it written, then,\nthat I shall really never know what I have so often dreamed of?”\n\n“What have you dreamed of?”\n\n“A man whom I can perfectly respect!” cried the young girl, with a\nsudden flame. “A man, at least, whom I can unrestrictedly admire. I meet\none, as I have met more than one before, whom I fondly believe to be\ncast in a larger mould than most of the vile human breed, to be large\nin character, great in talent, strong in will! In such a man as that,\nI say, one’s weary imagination at last may rest; or it may wander if it\nwill, yet never need to wander far from the deeps where one’s heart is\nanchored. When I first knew you, I gave no sign, but you had struck\nme. I observed you, as women observe, and I fancied you had the sacred\nfire.”\n\n“Before heaven, I believe I have!” cried Roderick.\n\n“Ah, but so little! It flickers and trembles and sputters; it goes out,\nyou tell me, for whole weeks together. From your own account, it ‘s ten\nto one that in the long run you ‘re a failure.”\n\n“I say those things sometimes myself, but when I hear you say them they\nmake me feel as if I could work twenty years at a sitting, on purpose to\nrefute you!”\n\n“Ah, the man who is strong with what I call strength,” Christina\nreplied, “would neither rise nor fall by anything I could say! I am a\npoor, weak woman; I have no strength myself, and I can give no strength.\nI am a miserable medley of vanity and folly. I am silly, I am ignorant,\nI am affected, I am false. I am the fruit of a horrible education, sown\non a worthless soil. I am all that, and yet I believe I have one merit!\nI should know a great character when I saw it, and I should delight in\nit with a generosity which would do something toward the remission of\nmy sins. For a man who should really give me a certain feeling--which\nI have never had, but which I should know when it came--I would send\nPrince Casamassima and his millions to perdition. I don’t know what you\nthink of me for saying all this; I suppose we have not climbed up here\nunder the skies to play propriety. Why have you been at such pains to\nassure me, after all, that you are a little man and not a great one, a\nweak one and not a strong? I innocently imagined that your eyes declared\nyou were strong. But your voice condemns you; I always wondered at it;\nit ‘s not the voice of a conqueror!”\n\n“Give me something to conquer,” cried Roderick, “and when I say that I\nthank you from my soul, my voice, whatever you think of it, shall speak\nthe truth!”\n\nChristina for a moment said nothing. Rowland was too interested to think\nof moving. “You pretend to such devotion,” she went on, “and yet I\nam sure you have never really chosen between me and that person in\nAmerica.”\n\n“Do me the favor not to speak of her,” said Roderick, imploringly.\n\n“Why not? I say no ill of her, and I think all kinds of good. I am\ncertain she is a far better girl than I, and far more likely to make you\nhappy.”\n\n“This is happiness, this present, palpable moment,” said Roderick;\n“though you have such a genius for saying the things that torture me!”\n\n“It ‘s greater happiness than you deserve, then! You have never chosen,\nI say; you have been afraid to choose. You have never really faced the\nfact that you are false, that you have broken your faith. You have never\nlooked at it and seen that it was hideous, and yet said, ‘No matter, I\n‘ll brave the penalty, I ‘ll bear the shame!’ You have closed your eyes;\nyou have tried to stifle remembrance, to persuade yourself that you were\nnot behaving as badly as you seemed to be, and there would be some\nway, after all, of compassing bliss and yet escaping trouble. You have\nfaltered and drifted, you have gone on from accident to accident, and I\nam sure that at this present moment you can’t tell what it is you really\ndesire!”\n\nRoderick was sitting with his knees drawn up and bent, and his hands\nclapsed around his legs. He bent his head and rested his forehead on his\nknees.\n\nChristina went on with a sort of infernal calmness: “I believe that,\nreally, you don’t greatly care for your friend in America any more than\nyou do for me. You are one of the men who care only for themselves and\nfor what they can make of themselves. That ‘s very well when they\ncan make something great, and I could interest myself in a man of\nextraordinary power who should wish to turn all his passions to account.\nBut if the power should turn out to be, after all, rather ordinary?\nFancy feeling one’s self ground in the mill of a third-rate talent! If\nyou have doubts about yourself, I can’t reassure you; I have too many\ndoubts myself, about everything in this weary world. You have gone up\nlike a rocket, in your profession, they tell me; are you going to come\ndown like the stick? I don’t pretend to know; I repeat frankly what I\nhave said before--that all modern sculpture seems to me weak, and that\nthe only things I care for are some of the most battered of the antiques\nof the Vatican. No, no, I can’t reassure you; and when you tell\nme--with a confidence in my discretion of which, certainly, I am duly\nsensible--that at times you feel terribly small, why, I can only answer,\n‘Ah, then, my poor friend, I am afraid you are small.’ The language I\nshould like to hear, from a certain person, would be the language of\nabsolute decision.”\n\nRoderick raised his head, but he said nothing; he seemed to be\nexchanging a long glance with his companion. The result of it was\nto make him fling himself back with an inarticulate murmur. Rowland,\nadmonished by the silence, was on the point of turning away, but he was\narrested by a gesture of the young girl. She pointed for a moment into\nthe blue air. Roderick followed the direction of her gesture.\n\n“Is that little flower we see outlined against that dark niche,” she\nasked, “as intensely blue as it looks through my veil?” She spoke\napparently with the amiable design of directing the conversation into a\nless painful channel.\n\nRowland, from where he stood, could see the flower she meant--a delicate\nplant of radiant hue, which sprouted from the top of an immense fragment\nof wall some twenty feet from Christina’s place.\n\nRoderick turned his head and looked at it without answering. At last,\nglancing round, “Put up your veil!” he said. Christina complied. “Does\nit look as blue now?” he asked.\n\n“Ah, what a lovely color!” she murmured, leaning her head on one side.\n\n“Would you like to have it?”\n\nShe stared a moment and then broke into a light laugh.\n\n“Would you like to have it?” he repeated in a ringing voice.\n\n“Don’t look as if you would eat me up,” she answered. “It ‘s harmless if\nI say yes!”\n\nRoderick rose to his feet and stood looking at the little flower. It\nwas separated from the ledge on which he stood by a rugged surface of\nvertical wall, which dropped straight into the dusky vaults behind the\narena. Suddenly he took off his hat and flung it behind him. Christina\nthen sprang to her feet.\n\n“I will bring it you,” he said.\n\nShe seized his arm. “Are you crazy? Do you mean to kill yourself?”\n\n“I shall not kill myself. Sit down!”\n\n“Excuse me. Not till you do!” And she grasped his arm with both hands.\n\nRoderick shook her off and pointed with a violent gesture to her former\nplace. “Go there!” he cried fiercely.\n\n“You can never, never!” she murmured beseechingly, clasping her hands.\n“I implore you!”\n\nRoderick turned and looked at her, and then in a voice which Rowland had\nnever heard him use, a voice almost thunderous, a voice which awakened\nthe echoes of the mighty ruin, he repeated, “Sit down!” She hesitated\na moment and then she dropped on the ground and buried her face in her\nhands.\n\nRowland had seen all this, and he saw more. He saw Roderick clasp in\nhis left arm the jagged corner of the vertical partition along which he\nproposed to pursue his crazy journey, stretch out his leg, and feel for\na resting-place for his foot. Rowland had measured with a glance the\npossibility of his sustaining himself, and pronounced it absolutely nil.\nThe wall was garnished with a series of narrow projections, the remains\napparently of a brick cornice supporting the arch of a vault which had\nlong since collapsed. It was by lodging his toes on these loose brackets\nand grasping with his hands at certain mouldering protuberances on a\nlevel with his head, that Roderick intended to proceed. The relics of\nthe cornice were utterly worthless as a support. Rowland had observed\nthis, and yet, for a moment, he had hesitated. If the thing were\npossible, he felt a sudden admiring glee at the thought of Roderick’s\ndoing it. It would be finely done, it would be gallant, it would have\na sort of masculine eloquence as an answer to Christina’s sinister\npersiflage. But it was not possible! Rowland left his place with a\nbound, and scrambled down some neighboring steps, and the next moment\na stronger pair of hands than Christina’s were laid upon Roderick’s\nshoulder.\n\nHe turned, staring, pale and angry. Christina rose, pale and staring,\ntoo, but beautiful in her wonder and alarm. “My dear Roderick,” said\nRowland, “I am only preventing you from doing a very foolish thing. That\n‘s an exploit for spiders, not for young sculptors of promise.”\n\nRoderick wiped his forehead, looked back at the wall, and then closed\nhis eyes, as if with a spasm, of retarded dizziness. “I won’t resist\nyou,” he said. “But I have made you obey,” he added, turning to\nChristina. “Am I weak now?”\n\nShe had recovered her composure; she looked straight past him and\naddressed Rowland: “Be so good as to show me the way out of this\nhorrible place!”\n\nHe helped her back into the corridor; Roderick followed after a short\ninterval. Of course, as they were descending the steps, came questions\nfor Rowland to answer, and more or less surprise. Where had he come\nfrom? how happened he to have appeared at just that moment? Rowland\nanswered that he had been rambling overhead, and that, looking out of an\naperture, he had seen a gentleman preparing to undertake a preposterous\ngymnastic feat, and a lady swooning away in consequence. Interference\nseemed justifiable, and he had made it as prompt as possible. Roderick\nwas far from hanging his head, like a man who has been caught in the\nperpetration of an extravagant folly; but if he held it more erect than\nusual Rowland believed that this was much less because he had made\na show of personal daring than because he had triumphantly proved to\nChristina that, like a certain person she had dreamed of, he too could\nspeak the language of decision. Christina descended to the arena in\nsilence, apparently occupied with her own thoughts. She betrayed\nno sense of the privacy of her interview with Roderick needing an\nexplanation. Rowland had seen stranger things in New York! The only\nevidence of her recent agitation was that, on being joined by her maid,\nshe declared that she was unable to walk home; she must have a carriage.\nA fiacre was found resting in the shadow of the Arch of Constantine,\nand Rowland suspected that after she had got into it she disburdened\nherself, under her veil, of a few natural tears.\n\nRowland had played eavesdropper to so good a purpose that he might\njustly have omitted the ceremony of denouncing himself to Roderick. He\npreferred, however, to let him know that he had overheard a portion of\nhis talk with Christina.\n\n“Of course it seems to you,” Roderick said, “a proof that I am utterly\ninfatuated.”\n\n“Miss Light seemed to me to know very well how far she could go,”\n Rowland answered. “She was twisting you round her finger. I don’t think\nshe exactly meant to defy you; but your crazy pursuit of that flower\nwas a proof that she could go all lengths in the way of making a fool of\nyou.”\n\n“Yes,” said Roderick, meditatively; “she is making a fool of me.”\n\n“And what do you expect to come of it?”\n\n“Nothing good!” And Roderick put his hands into his pockets and looked\nas if he had announced the most colorless fact in the world.\n\n“And in the light of your late interview, what do you make of your young\nlady?”\n\n“If I could tell you that, it would be plain sailing. But she ‘ll not\ntell me again I am weak!”\n\n“Are you very sure you are not weak?”\n\n“I may be, but she shall never know it.”\n\nRowland said no more until they reached the Corso, when he asked his\ncompanion whether he was going to his studio.\n\nRoderick started out of a reverie and passed his hands over his eyes.\n“Oh no, I can’t settle down to work after such a scene as that. I was\nnot afraid of breaking my neck then, but I feel all in a tremor now. I\nwill go--I will go and sit in the sun on the Pincio!”\n\n“Promise me this, first,” said Rowland, very solemnly: “that the next\ntime you meet Miss Light, it shall be on the earth and not in the air.”\n\nSince his return from Frascati, Roderick had been working doggedly at\nthe statue ordered by Mr. Leavenworth. To Rowland’s eye he had made a\nvery fair beginning, but he had himself insisted, from the first, that\nhe liked neither his subject nor his patron, and that it was impossible\nto feel any warmth of interest in a work which was to be incorporated\ninto the ponderous personality of Mr. Leavenworth. It was all against\nthe grain; he wrought without love. Nevertheless after a fashion he\nwrought, and the figure grew beneath his hands. Miss Blanchard’s friend\nwas ordering works of art on every side, and his purveyors were in many\ncases persons whom Roderick declared it was infamy to be paired with.\nThere had been grand tailors, he said, who declined to make you a coat\nunless you got the hat you were to wear with it from an artist of their\nown choosing. It seemed to him that he had an equal right to exact that\nhis statue should not form part of the same system of ornament as the\n“Pearl of Perugia,” a picture by an American confrere who had, in Mr.\nLeavenworth’s opinion, a prodigious eye for color. As a customer, Mr.\nLeavenworth used to drop into Roderick’s studio, to see how things\nwere getting on, and give a friendly hint or so. He would seat himself\nsquarely, plant his gold-topped cane between his legs, which he held\nvery much apart, rest his large white hands on the head, and enunciate\nthe principles of spiritual art, as he hoisted them one by one, as you\nmight say, out of the depths of his moral consciousness. His benignant\nand imperturbable pomposity gave Roderick the sense of suffocating\nbeneath a large fluffy bolster, and the worst of the matter was that\nthe good gentleman’s placid vanity had an integument whose toughness no\nsarcastic shaft could pierce. Roderick admitted that in thinking\nover the tribulations of struggling genius, the danger of dying of\nover-patronage had never occurred to him.\n\nThe deterring effect of the episode of the Coliseum was apparently of\nlong continuance; if Roderick’s nerves had been shaken his hand needed\ntime to recover its steadiness. He cultivated composure upon principles\nof his own; by frequenting entertainments from which he returned at four\no’clock in the morning, and lapsing into habits which might fairly be\ncalled irregular. He had hitherto made few friends among the artistic\nfraternity; chiefly because he had taken no trouble about it, and\nthere was in his demeanor an elastic independence of the favor of his\nfellow-mortals which made social advances on his own part peculiarly\nnecessary. Rowland had told him more than once that he ought to\nfraternize a trifle more with the other artists, and he had always\nanswered that he had not the smallest objection to fraternizing:\nlet them come! But they came on rare occasions, and Roderick was not\npunctilious about returning their visits. He declared there was not one\nof them whose works gave him the smallest desire to make acquaintance\nwith the insides of their heads. For Gloriani he professed a superb\ncontempt, and, having been once to look at his wares, never crossed\nhis threshold again. The only one of the fraternity for whom by his own\nadmission he cared a straw was little Singleton; but he expressed his\nregard only in a kind of sublime hilarity whenever he encountered this\nhumble genius, and quite forgot his existence in the intervals. He had\nnever been to see him, but Singleton edged his way, from time to time,\ntimidly, into Roderick’s studio, and agreed with characteristic modesty\nthat brilliant fellows like the sculptor might consent to receive\nhomage, but could hardly be expected to render it. Roderick never\nexactly accepted homage, and apparently did not quite observe whether\npoor Singleton spoke in admiration or in blame. Roderick’s taste as to\ncompanions was singularly capricious. There were very good fellows, who\nwere disposed to cultivate him, who bored him to death; and there were\nothers, in whom even Rowland’s good-nature was unable to discover a\npretext for tolerance, in whom he appeared to find the highest social\nqualities. He used to give the most fantastic reasons for his likes and\ndislikes. He would declare he could n’t speak a civil word to a man\nwho brushed his hair in a certain fashion, and he would explain his\nunaccountable fancy for an individual of imperceptible merit by telling\nyou that he had an ancestor who in the thirteenth century had walled up\nhis wife alive. “I like to talk to a man whose ancestor has walled up\nhis wife alive,” he would say. “You may not see the fun of it, and think\npoor P---- is a very dull fellow. It ‘s very possible; I don’t ask you\nto admire him. But, for reasons of my own, I like to have him about. The\nold fellow left her for three days with her face uncovered, and placed\na long mirror opposite to her, so that she could see, as he said, if her\ngown was a fit!”\n\nHis relish for an odd flavor in his friends had led him to make the\nacquaintance of a number of people outside of Rowland’s well-ordered\ncircle, and he made no secret of their being very queer fish. He formed\nan intimacy, among others, with a crazy fellow who had come to Rome\nas an emissary of one of the Central American republics, to drive some\necclesiastical bargain with the papal government. The Pope had given him\nthe cold shoulder, but since he had not prospered as a diplomatist, he\nhad sought compensation as a man of the world, and his great flamboyant\ncurricle and negro lackeys were for several weeks one of the striking\nornaments of the Pincian. He spoke a queer jargon of Italian, Spanish,\nFrench, and English, humorously relieved with scraps of ecclesiastical\nLatin, and to those who inquired of Roderick what he found to interest\nhim in such a fantastic jackanapes, the latter would reply, looking\nat his interlocutor with his lucid blue eyes, that it was worth any\nsacrifice to hear him talk nonsense! The two had gone together one night\nto a ball given by a lady of some renown in the Spanish colony, and very\nlate, on his way home, Roderick came up to Rowland’s rooms, in whose\nwindows he had seen a light. Rowland was going to bed, but Roderick\nflung himself into an armchair and chattered for an hour. The friends of\nthe Costa Rican envoy were as amusing as himself, and in very much the\nsame line. The mistress of the house had worn a yellow satin dress, and\ngold heels to her slippers, and at the close of the entertainment had\nsent for a pair of castanets, tucked up her petticoats, and danced a\nfandango, while the gentlemen sat cross-legged on the floor. “It was\nawfully low,” Roderick said; “all of a sudden I perceived it, and\nbolted. Nothing of that kind ever amuses me to the end: before it ‘s\nhalf over it bores me to death; it makes me sick. Hang it, why can’t a\npoor fellow enjoy things in peace? My illusions are all broken-winded;\nthey won’t carry me twenty paces! I can’t laugh and forget; my\nlaugh dies away before it begins. Your friend Stendhal writes on his\nbook-covers (I never got farther) that he has seen too early in life la\nbeaute parfaite. I don’t know how early he saw it; I saw it before I was\nborn--in another state of being! I can’t describe it positively; I can\nonly say I don’t find it anywhere now. Not at the bottom of champagne\nglasses; not, strange as it may seem, in that extra half-yard or so of\nshoulder that some women have their ball-dresses cut to expose. I\ndon’t find it at merry supper-tables, where half a dozen ugly men with\npomatumed heads are rapidly growing uglier still with heat and wine; not\nwhen I come away and walk through these squalid black streets, and go\nout into the Forum and see a few old battered stone posts standing there\nlike gnawed bones stuck into the earth. Everything is mean and dusky\nand shabby, and the men and women who make up this so-called brilliant\nsociety are the meanest and shabbiest of all. They have no real\nspontaneity; they are all cowards and popinjays. They have no more\ndignity than so many grasshoppers. Nothing is good but one!” And he\njumped up and stood looking at one of his statues, which shone vaguely\nacross the room in the dim lamplight.\n\n“Yes, do tell us,” said Rowland, “what to hold on by!”\n\n“Those things of mine were tolerably good,” he answered. “But my idea\nwas better--and that ‘s what I mean!”\n\nRowland said nothing. He was willing to wait for Roderick to complete\nthe circle of his metamorphoses, but he had no desire to officiate as\nchorus to the play. If Roderick chose to fish in troubled waters, he\nmust land his prizes himself.\n\n“You think I ‘m an impudent humbug,” the latter said at last, “coming\nup to moralize at this hour of the night. You think I want to throw\ndust into your eyes, to put you off the scent. That ‘s your eminently\nrational view of the case.”\n\n“Excuse me from taking any view at all,” said Rowland.\n\n“You have given me up, then?”\n\n“No, I have merely suspended judgment. I am waiting.”\n\n“You have ceased then positively to believe in me?”\n\nRowland made an angry gesture. “Oh, cruel boy! When you have hit your\nmark and made people care for you, you should n’t twist your weapon\nabout at that rate in their vitals. Allow me to say I am sleepy. Good\nnight!”\n\nSome days afterward it happened that Rowland, on a long afternoon\nramble, took his way through one of the quiet corners of the Trastevere.\nHe was particularly fond of this part of Rome, though he could hardly\nhave expressed the charm he found in it. As you pass away from the\ndusky, swarming purlieus of the Ghetto, you emerge into a region of\nempty, soundless, grass-grown lanes and alleys, where the shabby houses\nseem mouldering away in disuse, and yet your footstep brings figures of\nstartling Roman type to the doorways. There are few monuments here, but\nno part of Rome seemed more historic, in the sense of being weighted\nwith a crushing past, blighted with the melancholy of things that had\nhad their day. When the yellow afternoon sunshine slept on the sallow,\nbattered walls, and lengthened the shadows in the grassy courtyards of\nsmall closed churches, the place acquired a strange fascination. The\nchurch of Saint Cecilia has one of these sunny, waste-looking courts;\nthe edifice seems abandoned to silence and the charity of chance\ndevotion. Rowland never passed it without going in, and he was generally\nthe only visitor. He entered it now, but found that two persons had\npreceded him. Both were women. One was at her prayers at one of the side\naltars; the other was seated against a column at the upper end of the\nnave. Rowland walked to the altar, and paid, in a momentary glance at\nthe clever statue of the saint in death, in the niche beneath it, the\nusual tribute to the charm of polished ingenuity. As he turned away he\nlooked at the person seated and recognized Christina Light. Seeing that\nshe perceived him, he advanced to speak to her.\n\nShe was sitting in a listless attitude, with her hands in her lap;\nshe seemed to be tired. She was dressed simply, as if for walking and\nescaping observation. When he had greeted her he glanced back at her\ncompanion, and recognized the faithful Assunta.\n\nChristina smiled. “Are you looking for Mr. Hudson? He is not here, I am\nhappy to say.”\n\n“But you?” he asked. “This is a strange place to find you.”\n\n“Not at all! People call me a strange girl, and I might as well have the\ncomfort of it. I came to take a walk; that, by the way, is part of\nmy strangeness. I can’t loll all the morning on a sofa, and all the\nafternoon in a carriage. I get horribly restless. I must move; I must\ndo something and see something. Mamma suggests a cup of tea. Meanwhile I\nput on an old dress and half a dozen veils, I take Assunta under my arm,\nand we start on a pedestrian tour. It ‘s a bore that I can’t take the\npoodle, but he attracts attention. We trudge about everywhere; there\nis nothing I like so much. I hope you will congratulate me on the\nsimplicity of my tastes.”\n\n“I congratulate you on your wisdom. To live in Rome and not to walk\nwould, I think, be poor pleasure. But you are terribly far from home,\nand I am afraid you are tired.”\n\n“A little--enough to sit here a while.”\n\n“Might I offer you my company while you rest?”\n\n“If you will promise to amuse me. I am in dismal spirits.”\n\nRowland said he would do what he could, and brought a chair and placed\nit near her. He was not in love with her; he disapproved of her; he\nmistrusted her; and yet he felt it a kind of privilege to watch her, and\nhe found a peculiar excitement in talking to her. The background of her\nnature, as he would have called it, was large and mysterious, and it\nemitted strange, fantastic gleams and flashes. Watching for these rather\nquickened one’s pulses. Moreover, it was not a disadvantage to talk to\na girl who made one keep guard on one’s composure; it diminished one’s\nchronic liability to utter something less than revised wisdom.\n\nAssunta had risen from her prayers, and, as he took his place, was\ncoming back to her mistress. But Christina motioned her away. “No, no;\nwhile you are about it, say a few dozen more!” she said. “Pray for me,”\n she added in English. “Pray, I say nothing silly. She has been at it\nhalf an hour; I envy her capacity!”\n\n“Have you never felt in any degree,” Rowland asked, “the fascination of\nCatholicism?”\n\n“Yes, I have been through that, too! There was a time when I wanted\nimmensely to be a nun; it was not a laughing matter. It was when I was\nabout sixteen years old. I read the Imitation and the Life of Saint\nCatherine. I fully believed in the miracles of the saints, and I was\ndying to have one of my own. The least little accident that could have\nbeen twisted into a miracle would have carried me straight into the\nbosom of the church. I had the real religious passion. It has passed\naway, and, as I sat here just now, I was wondering what had become of\nit!”\n\nRowland had already been sensible of something in this young lady’s tone\nwhich he would have called a want of veracity, and this epitome of her\nreligious experience failed to strike him as an absolute statement of\nfact. But the trait was not disagreeable, for she herself was evidently\nthe foremost dupe of her inventions. She had a fictitious history\nin which she believed much more fondly than in her real one, and an\ninfinite capacity for extemporized reminiscence adapted to the mood\nof the hour. She liked to idealize herself, to take interesting and\npicturesque attitudes to her own imagination; and the vivacity and\nspontaneity of her character gave her, really, a starting-point in\nexperience; so that the many-colored flowers of fiction which blossomed\nin her talk were not so much perversions, as sympathetic exaggerations,\nof fact. And Rowland felt that whatever she said of herself might have\nbeen, under the imagined circumstances; impulse was there, audacity, the\nrestless, questioning temperament. “I am afraid I am sadly prosaic,”\n he said, “for in these many months now that I have been in Rome, I\nhave never ceased for a moment to look at Catholicism simply from the\noutside. I don’t see an opening as big as your finger-nail where I could\ncreep into it!”\n\n“What do you believe?” asked Christina, looking at him. “Are you\nreligious?”\n\n“I believe in God.”\n\nChristina let her beautiful eyes wander a while, and then gave a little\nsigh. “You are much to be envied!”\n\n“You, I imagine, in that line have nothing to envy me.”\n\n“Yes, I have. Rest!”\n\n“You are too young to say that.”\n\n“I am not young; I have never been young! My mother took care of that. I\nwas a little wrinkled old woman at ten.”\n\n“I am afraid,” said Rowland, in a moment, “that you are fond of painting\nyourself in dark colors.”\n\nShe looked at him a while in silence. “Do you wish,” she demanded at\nlast, “to win my eternal gratitude? Prove to me that I am better than I\nsuppose.”\n\n“I should have first to know what you really suppose.”\n\nShe shook her head. “It would n’t do. You would be horrified to learn\neven the things I imagine about myself, and shocked at the knowledge of\nevil displayed in my very mistakes.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Rowland, “I will ask no questions. But, at a venture,\nI promise you to catch you some day in the act of doing something very\ngood.”\n\n“Can it be, can it be,” she asked, “that you too are trying to flatter\nme? I thought you and I had fallen, from the first, into rather a\ntruth-speaking vein.”\n\n“Oh, I have not abandoned it!” said Rowland; and he determined, since he\nhad the credit of homely directness, to push his advantage farther. The\nopportunity seemed excellent. But while he was hesitating as to just how\nto begin, the young girl said, bending forward and clasping her hands in\nher lap, “Please tell me about your religion.”\n\n“Tell you about it? I can’t!” said Rowland, with a good deal of\nemphasis.\n\nShe flushed a little. “Is it such a mighty mystery it cannot be put into\nwords, nor communicated to my base ears?”\n\n“It is simply a sentiment that makes part of my life, and I can’t detach\nmyself from it sufficiently to talk about it.”\n\n“Religion, it seems to me, should be eloquent and aggressive. It should\nwish to make converts, to persuade and illumine, to sway all hearts!”\n\n“One’s religion takes the color of one’s general disposition. I am not\naggressive, and certainly I am not eloquent.”\n\n“Beware, then, of finding yourself confronted with doubt and despair! I\nam sure that doubt, at times, and the bitterness that comes of it, can\nbe terribly eloquent. To tell the truth, my lonely musings, before\nyou came in, were eloquent enough, in their way. What do you know of\nanything but this strange, terrible world that surrounds you? How do you\nknow that your faith is not a mere crazy castle in the air; one of those\ncastles that we are called fools for building when we lodge them in this\nlife?”\n\n“I don’t know it, any more than any one knows the contrary. But one’s\nreligion is extremely ingenious in doing without knowledge.”\n\n“In such a world as this it certainly needs to be!”\n\nRowland smiled. “What is your particular quarrel with this world?”\n\n“It ‘s a general quarrel. Nothing is true, or fixed, or permanent. We\nall seem to be playing with shadows more or less grotesque. It all comes\nover me here so dismally! The very atmosphere of this cold, deserted\nchurch seems to mock at one’s longing to believe in something. Who cares\nfor it now? who comes to it? who takes it seriously? Poor stupid Assunta\nthere gives in her adhesion in a jargon she does n’t understand, and\nyou and I, proper, passionless tourists, come lounging in to rest from\na walk. And yet the Catholic church was once the proudest institution\nin the world, and had quite its own way with men’s souls. When such a\nmighty structure as that turns out to have a flaw, what faith is one to\nput in one’s poor little views and philosophies? What is right and what\nis wrong? What is one really to care for? What is the proper rule of\nlife? I am tired of trying to discover, and I suspect it ‘s not worth\nthe trouble. Live as most amuses you!”\n\n“Your perplexities are so terribly comprehensive,” said Rowland,\nsmiling, “that one hardly knows where to meet them first.”\n\n“I don’t care much for anything you can say, because it ‘s sure to be\nhalf-hearted. You are not in the least contented, yourself.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“Oh, I am an observer!”\n\n“No one is absolutely contented, I suppose, but I assure you I complain\nof nothing.”\n\n“So much the worse for your honesty. To begin with, you are in love.”\n\n“You would not have me complain of that!”\n\n“And it does n’t go well. There are grievous obstacles. So much I know!\nYou need n’t protest; I ask no questions. You will tell no one--me least\nof all. Why does one never see you?”\n\n“Why, if I came to see you,” said Rowland, deliberating, “it would n’t\nbe, it could n’t be, for a trivial reason--because I had not been in a\nmonth, because I was passing, because I admire you. It would be because\nI should have something very particular to say. I have not come, because\nI have been slow in making up my mind to say it.”\n\n“You are simply cruel. Something particular, in this ocean of inanities?\nIn common charity, speak!”\n\n“I doubt whether you will like it.”\n\n“Oh, I hope to heaven it ‘s not a compliment!”\n\n“It may be called a compliment to your reasonableness. You perhaps\nremember that I gave you a hint of it the other day at Frascati.”\n\n“Has it been hanging fire all this time? Explode! I promise not to stop\nmy ears.”\n\n“It relates to my friend Hudson.” And Rowland paused. She was looking at\nhim expectantly; her face gave no sign. “I am rather disturbed in mind\nabout him. He seems to me at times to be in an unpromising way.” He\npaused again, but Christina said nothing. “The case is simply this,”\n he went on. “It was by my advice he renounced his career at home and\nembraced his present one. I made him burn his ships. I brought him to\nRome, I launched him in the world, and I stand surety, in a measure,\nto--to his mother, for his prosperity. It is not such smooth sailing as\nit might be, and I am inclined to put up prayers for fair winds. If he\nis to succeed, he must work--quietly, devotedly. It is not news to you,\nI imagine, that Hudson is a great admirer of yours.”\n\nChristina remained silent; she turned away her eyes with an air, not\nof confusion, but of deep deliberation. Surprising frankness had, as a\ngeneral thing, struck Rowland as the key-note of her character, but she\nhad more than once given him a suggestion of an unfathomable power\nof calculation, and her silence now had something which it is hardly\nextravagant to call portentous. He had of course asked himself how far\nit was questionable taste to inform an unprotected girl, for the needs\nof a cause, that another man admired her; the thing, superficially, had\nan uncomfortable analogy with the shrewdness that uses a cat’s paw and\nlets it risk being singed. But he decided that even rigid discretion\nis not bound to take a young lady at more than her own valuation,\nand Christina presently reassured him as to the limits of her\nsusceptibility. “Mr. Hudson is in love with me!” she said.\n\nRowland flinched a trifle. Then--“Am I,” he asked, “from this point of\nview of mine, to be glad or sorry?”\n\n“I don’t understand you.”\n\n“Why, is Hudson to be happy, or unhappy?”\n\nShe hesitated a moment. “You wish him to be great in his profession? And\nfor that you consider that he must be happy in his life?”\n\n“Decidedly. I don’t say it ‘s a general rule, but I think it is a rule\nfor him.”\n\n“So that if he were very happy, he would become very great?”\n\n“He would at least do himself justice.”\n\n“And by that you mean a great deal?”\n\n“A great deal.”\n\nChristina sank back in her chair and rested her eyes on the cracked\nand polished slabs of the pavement. At last, looking up, “You have not\nforgotten, I suppose, that you told me he was engaged?”\n\n“By no means.”\n\n“He is still engaged, then?”\n\n“To the best of my belief.”\n\n“And yet you desire that, as you say, he should be made happy by\nsomething I can do for him?”\n\n“What I desire is this. That your great influence with him should\nbe exerted for his good, that it should help him and not retard him.\nUnderstand me. You probably know that your lovers have rather a restless\ntime of it. I can answer for two of them. You don’t know your own mind\nvery well, I imagine, and you like being admired, rather at the expense\nof the admirer. Since we are really being frank, I wonder whether I\nmight not say the great word.”\n\n“You need n’t; I know it. I am a horrible coquette.”\n\n“No, not a horrible one, since I am making an appeal to your generosity.\nI am pretty sure you cannot imagine yourself marrying my friend.”\n\n“There ‘s nothing I cannot imagine! That is my trouble.”\n\nRowland’s brow contracted impatiently. “I cannot imagine it, then!” he\naffirmed.\n\nChristina flushed faintly; then, very gently, “I am not so bad as you\nthink,” she said.\n\n“It is not a question of badness; it is a question of whether\ncircumstances don’t make the thing an extreme improbability.”\n\n“Worse and worse. I can be bullied, then, or bribed!”\n\n“You are not so candid,” said Rowland, “as you pretend to be. My feeling\nis this. Hudson, as I understand him, does not need, as an artist, the\nstimulus of strong emotion, of passion. He’s better without it; he’s\nemotional and passionate enough when he ‘s left to himself. The sooner\npassion is at rest, therefore, the sooner he will settle down to work,\nand the fewer emotions he has that are mere emotions and nothing more,\nthe better for him. If you cared for him enough to marry him, I should\nhave nothing to say; I would never venture to interfere. But I strongly\nsuspect you don’t, and therefore I would suggest, most respectfully,\nthat you should let him alone.”\n\n“And if I let him alone, as you say, all will be well with him for ever\nmore?”\n\n“Not immediately and not absolutely, but things will be easier. He will\nbe better able to concentrate himself.”\n\n“What is he doing now? Wherein does he dissatisfy you?”\n\n“I can hardly say. He ‘s like a watch that ‘s running down. He is moody,\ndesultory, idle, irregular, fantastic.”\n\n“Heavens, what a list! And it ‘s all poor me?”\n\n“No, not all. But you are a part of it, and I turn to you because you\nare a more tangible, sensible, responsible cause than the others.”\n\nChristina raised her hand to her eyes, and bent her head thoughtfully.\nRowland was puzzled to measure the effect of his venture; she rather\nsurprised him by her gentleness. At last, without moving, “If I were to\nmarry him,” she asked, “what would have become of his fiancee?”\n\n“I am bound to suppose that she would be extremely unhappy.”\n\nChristina said nothing more, and Rowland, to let her make her\nreflections, left his place and strolled away. Poor Assunta, sitting\npatiently on a stone bench, and unprovided, on this occasion, with\nmilitary consolation, gave him a bright, frank smile, which might have\nbeen construed as an expression of regret for herself, and of sympathy\nfor her mistress. Rowland presently seated himself again near Christina.\n\n“What do you think,” she asked, looking at him, “of your friend’s\ninfidelity?”\n\n“I don’t like it.”\n\n“Was he very much in love with her?”\n\n“He asked her to marry him. You may judge.”\n\n“Is she rich?”\n\n“No, she is poor.”\n\n“Is she very much in love with him?”\n\n“I know her too little to say.”\n\nShe paused again, and then resumed: “You have settled in your mind,\nthen, that I will never seriously listen to him?”\n\n“I think it unlikely, until the contrary is proved.”\n\n“How shall it be proved? How do you know what passes between us?”\n\n“I can judge, of course, but from appearance; but, like you, I am an\nobserver. Hudson has not at all the air of a prosperous suitor.”\n\n“If he is depressed, there is a reason. He has a bad conscience. One\nmust hope so, at least. On the other hand, simply as a friend,” she\ncontinued gently, “you think I can do him no good?”\n\nThe humility of her tone, combined with her beauty, as she made this\nremark, was inexpressibly touching, and Rowland had an uncomfortable\nsense of being put at a disadvantage. “There are doubtless many good\nthings you might do, if you had proper opportunity,” he said. “But you\nseem to be sailing with a current which leaves you little leisure for\nquiet benevolence. You live in the whirl and hurry of a world into which\na poor artist can hardly find it to his advantage to follow you.”\n\n“In plain English, I am hopelessly frivolous. You put it very\ngenerously.”\n\n“I won’t hesitate to say all my thought,” said Rowland. “For better or\nworse, you seem to me to belong, both by character and by circumstance,\nto what is called the world, the great world. You are made to ornament\nit magnificently. You are not made to be an artist’s wife.”\n\n“I see. But even from your point of view, that would depend upon the\nartist. Extraordinary talent might make him a member of the great\nworld!”\n\nRowland smiled. “That is very true.”\n\n“If, as it is,” Christina continued in a moment, “you take a low view of\nme--no, you need n’t protest--I wonder what you would think if you knew\ncertain things.”\n\n“What things do you mean?”\n\n“Well, for example, how I was brought up. I have had a horrible\neducation. There must be some good in me, since I have perceived it,\nsince I have turned and judged my circumstances.”\n\n“My dear Miss Light!” Rowland murmured.\n\nShe gave a little, quick laugh. “You don’t want to hear? you don’t want\nto have to think about that?”\n\n“Have I a right to? You need n’t justify yourself.”\n\nShe turned upon him a moment the quickened light of her beautiful eyes,\nthen fell to musing again. “Is there not some novel or some play,” she\nasked at last, “in which some beautiful, wicked woman who has ensnared a\nyoung man sees his father come to her and beg her to let him go?”\n\n“Very likely,” said Rowland. “I hope she consents.”\n\n“I forget. But tell me,” she continued, “shall you consider--admitting\nyour proposition--that in ceasing to flirt with Mr. Hudson, so that\nhe may go about his business, I do something magnanimous, heroic,\nsublime--something with a fine name like that?”\n\nRowland, elated with the prospect of gaining his point, was about\nto reply that she would deserve the finest name in the world; but he\ninstantly suspected that this tone would not please her, and, besides,\nit would not express his meaning.\n\n“You do something I shall greatly respect,” he contented himself with\nsaying.\n\nShe made no answer, and in a moment she beckoned to her maid. “What have\nI to do to-day?” she asked.\n\nAssunta meditated. “Eh, it ‘s a very busy day! Fortunately I have a\nbetter memory than the signorina,” she said, turning to Rowland. She\nbegan to count on her fingers. “We have to go to the Pie di Marmo to see\nabout those laces that were sent to be washed. You said also that you\nwished to say three sharp words to the Buonvicini about your pink dress.\nYou want some moss-rosebuds for to-night, and you won’t get them for\nnothing! You dine at the Austrian Embassy, and that Frenchman is to\npowder your hair. You ‘re to come home in time to receive, for the\nsignora gives a dance. And so away, away till morning!”\n\n“Ah, yes, the moss-roses!” Christina murmured, caressingly. “I must have\na quantity--at least a hundred. Nothing but buds, eh? You must sew them\nin a kind of immense apron, down the front of my dress. Packed tight\ntogether, eh? It will be delightfully barbarous. And then twenty more or\nso for my hair. They go very well with powder; don’t you think so?” And\nshe turned to Rowland. “I am going en Pompadour.”\n\n“Going where?”\n\n“To the Spanish Embassy, or whatever it is.”\n\n“All down the front, signorina? Dio buono! You must give me time!”\n Assunta cried.\n\n“Yes, we’ll go!” And she left her place. She walked slowly to the door\nof the church, looking at the pavement, and Rowland could not guess\nwhether she was thinking of her apron of moss-rosebuds or of her\nopportunity for moral sublimity. Before reaching the door she turned\naway and stood gazing at an old picture, indistinguishable with\nblackness, over an altar. At last they passed out into the court.\nGlancing at her in the open air, Rowland was startled; he imagined he\nsaw the traces of hastily suppressed tears. They had lost time, she\nsaid, and they must hurry; she sent Assunta to look for a fiacre. She\nremained silent a while, scratching the ground with the point of her\nparasol, and then at last, looking up, she thanked Rowland for his\nconfidence in her “reasonableness.” “It ‘s really very comfortable to be\nasked, to be expected, to do something good, after all the horrid things\none has been used to doing--instructed, commanded, forced to do! I ‘ll\nthink over what you have said to me.” In that deserted quarter fiacres\nare rare, and there was some delay in Assunta’s procuring one. Christina\ntalked of the church, of the picturesque old court, of that strange,\ndecaying corner of Rome. Rowland was perplexed; he was ill at ease.\nAt last the fiacre arrived, but she waited a moment longer. “So,\ndecidedly,” she suddenly asked, “I can only harm him?”\n\n“You make me feel very brutal,” said Rowland.\n\n“And he is such a fine fellow that it would be really a great pity, eh?”\n\n“I shall praise him no more,” Rowland said.\n\nShe turned away quickly, but she lingered still. “Do you remember\npromising me, soon after we first met, that at the end of six months you\nwould tell me definitely what you thought of me?”\n\n“It was a foolish promise.”\n\n“You gave it. Bear it in mind. I will think of what you have said to me.\nFarewell.” She stepped into the carriage, and it rolled away. Rowland\nstood for some minutes, looking after it, and then went his way with\na sigh. If this expressed general mistrust, he ought, three days\nafterward, to have been reassured. He received by the post a note\ncontaining these words:--\n\n“I have done it. Begin and respect me!\n\n“--C. L.”\n\nTo be perfectly satisfactory, indeed, the note required a commentary.\nHe called that evening upon Roderick, and found one in the information\noffered him at the door, by the old serving-woman--the startling\ninformation that the signorino had gone to Naples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. Provocation\n\nAbout a month later, Rowland addressed to his cousin Cecilia a letter of\nwhich the following is a portion:--\n\n... “So much for myself; yet I tell you but a tithe of my own story\nunless I let you know how matters stand with poor Hudson, for he gives\nme more to think about just now than anything else in the world. I need\na good deal of courage to begin this chapter. You warned me, you know,\nand I made rather light of your warning. I have had all kinds of hopes\nand fears, but hitherto, in writing to you, I have resolutely put the\nhopes foremost. Now, however, my pride has forsaken me, and I should\nlike hugely to give expression to a little comfortable despair. I should\nlike to say, ‘My dear wise woman, you were right and I was wrong; you\nwere a shrewd observer and I was a meddlesome donkey!’ When I think of\na little talk we had about the ‘salubrity of genius,’ I feel my ears\ntingle. If this is salubrity, give me raging disease! I ‘m pestered to\ndeath; I go about with a chronic heartache; there are moments when I\ncould shed salt tears. There ‘s a pretty portrait of the most placid\nof men! I wish I could make you understand; or rather, I wish you could\nmake me! I don’t understand a jot; it ‘s a hideous, mocking mystery; I\ngive it up! I don’t in the least give it up, you know; I ‘m incapable\nof giving it up. I sit holding my head by the hour, racking my brain,\nwondering what under heaven is to be done. You told me at Northampton\nthat I took the thing too easily; you would tell me now, perhaps, that\nI take it too hard. I do, altogether; but it can’t be helped. Without\nflattering myself, I may say I ‘m sympathetic. Many another man before\nthis would have cast his perplexities to the winds and declared that Mr.\nHudson must lie on his bed as he had made it. Some men, perhaps, would\neven say that I am making a mighty ado about nothing; that I have only\nto give him rope, and he will tire himself out. But he tugs at his rope\naltogether too hard for me to hold it comfortably. I certainly never\npretended the thing was anything else than an experiment; I promised\nnothing, I answered for nothing; I only said the case was hopeful, and\nthat it would be a shame to neglect it. I have done my best, and if\nthe machine is running down I have a right to stand aside and let it\nscuttle. Amen, amen! No, I can write that, but I can’t feel it. I can’t\nbe just; I can only be generous. I love the poor fellow and I can’t give\nhim up. As for understanding him, that ‘s another matter; nowadays I\ndon’t believe even you would. One’s wits are sadly pestered over here,\nI assure you, and I ‘m in the way of seeing more than one puzzling\nspecimen of human nature. Roderick and Miss Light, between them!...\nHave n’t I already told you about Miss Light? Last winter everything was\nperfection. Roderick struck out bravely, did really great things, and\nproved himself, as I supposed, thoroughly solid. He was strong, he was\nfirst-rate; I felt perfectly secure and sang private paeans of joy. We\nhad passed at a bound into the open sea, and left danger behind. But\nin the summer I began to be puzzled, though I succeeded in not being\nalarmed. When we came back to Rome, however, I saw that the tide had\nturned and that we were close upon the rocks. It is, in fact, another\ncase of Ulysses alongside of the Sirens; only Roderick refuses to be\ntied to the mast. He is the most extraordinary being, the strangest\nmixture of qualities. I don’t understand so much force going with so\nmuch weakness--such a brilliant gift being subject to such lapses. The\npoor fellow is incomplete, and it is really not his own fault; Nature\nhas given him the faculty out of hand and bidden him be hanged with it.\nI never knew a man harder to advise or assist, if he is not in the mood\nfor listening. I suppose there is some key or other to his character,\nbut I try in vain to find it; and yet I can’t believe that Providence\nis so cruel as to have turned the lock and thrown the key away. He\nperplexes me, as I say, to death, and though he tires out my patience,\nhe still fascinates me. Sometimes I think he has n’t a grain of\nconscience, and sometimes I think that, in a way, he has an excess. He\ntakes things at once too easily and too hard; he is both too lax and too\ntense, too reckless and too ambitious, too cold and too passionate. He\nhas developed faster even than you prophesied, and for good and evil\nalike he takes up a formidable space. There ‘s too much of him for me,\nat any rate. Yes, he is hard; there is no mistake about that. He ‘s\ninflexible, he ‘s brittle; and though he has plenty of spirit, plenty of\nsoul, he has n’t what I call a heart. He has something that Miss Garland\ntook for one, and I ‘m pretty sure she ‘s a judge. But she judged on\nscanty evidence. He has something that Christina Light, here, makes\nbelieve at times that she takes for one, but she is no judge at all! I\nthink it is established that, in the long run, egotism makes a failure\nin conduct: is it also true that it makes a failure in the arts?...\nRoderick’s standard is immensely high; I must do him that justice. He\nwill do nothing beneath it, and while he is waiting for inspiration, his\nimagination, his nerves, his senses must have something to amuse them.\nThis is a highly philosophical way of saying that he has taken to\ndissipation, and that he has just been spending a month at Naples--a\ncity where ‘pleasure’ is actively cultivated--in very bad company.\nAre they all like that, all the men of genius? There are a great many\nartists here who hammer away at their trade with exemplary industry; in\nfact I am surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a steady,\ndaily grind: but I really don’t think that one of them has his exquisite\nquality of talent. It is in the matter of quantity that he has broken\ndown. The bottle won’t pour; he turns it upside down; it ‘s no use!\nSometimes he declares it ‘s empty--that he has done all he was made to\ndo. This I consider great nonsense; but I would nevertheless take him on\nhis own terms if it was only I that was concerned. But I keep thinking\nof those two praying, trusting neighbors of yours, and I feel wretchedly\nlike a swindler. If his working mood came but once in five years I would\nwillingly wait for it and maintain him in leisure, if need be, in the\nintervals; but that would be a sorry account to present to them. Five\nyears of this sort of thing, moreover, would effectually settle the\nquestion. I wish he were less of a genius and more of a charlatan! He ‘s\ntoo confoundedly all of one piece; he won’t throw overboard a grain\nof the cargo to save the rest. Fancy him thus with all his brilliant\npersonal charm, his handsome head, his careless step, his look as of a\nnervous nineteenth-century Apollo, and you will understand that there\nis mighty little comfort in seeing him in a bad way. He was tolerably\nfoolish last summer at Baden Baden, but he got on his feet, and for a\nwhile he was steady. Then he began to waver again, and at last toppled\nover. Now, literally, he ‘s lying prone. He came into my room last\nnight, miserably tipsy. I assure you, it did n’t amuse me..... About\nMiss Light it ‘s a long story. She is one of the great beauties of all\ntime, and worth coming barefoot to Rome, like the pilgrims of old, to\nsee. Her complexion, her glance, her step, her dusky tresses, may have\nbeen seen before in a goddess, but never in a woman. And you may take\nthis for truth, because I ‘m not in love with her. On the contrary! Her\neducation has been simply infernal. She is corrupt, perverse, as proud\nas the queen of Sheba, and an appalling coquette; but she is generous,\nand with patience and skill you may enlist her imagination in a good\ncause as well as in a bad one. The other day I tried to manipulate it a\nlittle. Chance offered me an interview to which it was possible to give\na serious turn, and I boldly broke ground and begged her to suffer\nmy poor friend to go in peace. After a good deal of finessing she\nconsented, and the next day, with a single word, packed him off to\nNaples to drown his sorrow in debauchery. I have come to the conclusion\nthat she is more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious\nones, and that she probably has a way of turning her back which is the\nmost provoking thing in the world. She ‘s an actress, she could n’t\nforego doing the thing dramatically, and it was the dramatic touch that\nmade it fatal. I wished her, of course, to let him down easily; but\nshe desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude, and her attitudes\ndeprive inflammable young artists of their reason..... Roderick made an\nadmirable bust of her at the beginning of the winter, and a dozen women\ncame rushing to him to be done, mutatis mutandis, in the same style.\nThey were all great ladies and ready to take him by the hand, but he\ntold them all their faces did n’t interest him, and sent them away\nvowing his destruction.”\n\nAt this point of his long effusion, Rowland had paused and put by his\nletter. He kept it three days and then read it over. He was disposed at\nfirst to destroy it, but he decided finally to keep it, in the hope that\nit might strike a spark of useful suggestion from the flint of Cecilia’s\ngood sense. We know he had a talent for taking advice. And then it might\nbe, he reflected, that his cousin’s answer would throw some light on\nMary Garland’s present vision of things. In his altered mood he added\nthese few lines:--\n\n“I unburdened myself the other day of this monstrous load of perplexity;\nI think it did me good, and I let it stand. I was in a melancholy\nmuddle, and I was trying to work myself free. You know I like\ndiscussion, in a quiet way, and there is no one with whom I can have it\nas quietly as with you, most sagacious of cousins! There is an excellent\nold lady with whom I often chat, and who talks very much to the point.\nBut Madame Grandoni has disliked Roderick from the first, and if I were\nto take her advice I would wash my hands of him. You will laugh at me\nfor my long face, but you would do that in any circumstances. I am half\nashamed of my letter, for I have a faith in my friend that is deeper\nthan my doubts. He was here last evening, talking about the Naples\nMuseum, the Aristides, the bronzes, the Pompeian frescoes, with such\na beautiful intelligence that doubt of the ultimate future seemed\nblasphemy. I walked back to his lodging with him, and he was as mild\nas midsummer moonlight. He has the ineffable something that charms and\nconvinces; my last word about him shall not be a harsh one.”\n\nShortly after sending his letter, going one day into his friend’s\nstudio, he found Roderick suffering from the grave infliction of a visit\nfrom Mr. Leavenworth. Roderick submitted with extreme ill grace to being\nbored, and he was now evidently in a state of high exasperation. He had\nlately begun a representation of a lazzarone lounging in the sun; an\nimage of serene, irresponsible, sensuous life. The real lazzarone, he\nhad admitted, was a vile fellow; but the ideal lazzarone--and his own\nhad been subtly idealized--was a precursor of the millennium.\n\nMr. Leavenworth had apparently just transferred his unhurrying gaze to\nthe figure.\n\n“Something in the style of the Dying Gladiator?” he sympathetically\nobserved.\n\n“Oh no,” said Roderick seriously, “he ‘s not dying, he ‘s only drunk!”\n\n“Ah, but intoxication, you know,” Mr. Leavenworth rejoined, “is not a\nproper subject for sculpture. Sculpture should not deal with transitory\nattitudes.”\n\n“Lying dead drunk is not a transitory attitude! Nothing is more\npermanent, more sculpturesque, more monumental!”\n\n“An entertaining paradox,” said Mr. Leavenworth, “if we had time to\nexercise our wits upon it. I remember at Florence an intoxicated figure\nby Michael Angelo which seemed to me a deplorable aberration of a\ngreat mind. I myself touch liquor in no shape whatever. I have traveled\nthrough Europe on cold water. The most varied and attractive lists of\nwines are offered me, but I brush them aside. No cork has ever been\ndrawn at my command!”\n\n“The movement of drawing a cork calls into play a very pretty set\nof muscles,” said Roderick. “I think I will make a figure in that\nposition.”\n\n“A Bacchus, realistically treated! My dear young friend, never trifle\nwith your lofty mission. Spotless marble should represent virtue, not\nvice!” And Mr. Leavenworth placidly waved his hand, as if to exorcise\nthe spirit of levity, while his glance journeyed with leisurely\nbenignity to another object--a marble replica of the bust of Miss Light.\n“An ideal head, I presume,” he went on; “a fanciful representation of\none of the pagan goddesses--a Diana, a Flora, a naiad or dryad? I often\nregret that our American artists should not boldly cast off that extinct\nnomenclature.”\n\n“She is neither a naiad nor a dryad,” said Roderick, “and her name is as\ngood as yours or mine.”\n\n“You call her”--Mr. Leavenworth blandly inquired.\n\n“Miss Light,” Rowland interposed, in charity.\n\n“Ah, our great American beauty! Not a pagan goddess--an American,\nChristian lady! Yes, I have had the pleasure of conversing with Miss\nLight. Her conversational powers are not remarkable, but her beauty\nis of a high order. I observed her the other evening at a large party,\nwhere some of the proudest members of the European aristocracy were\npresent--duchesses, princesses, countesses, and others distinguished by\nsimilar titles. But for beauty, grace, and elegance my fair countrywoman\nleft them all nowhere. What women can compare with a truly refined\nAmerican lady? The duchesses the other night had no attractions for my\neyes; they looked coarse and sensual! It seemed to me that the tyranny\nof class distinctions must indeed be terrible when such countenances\ncould inspire admiration. You see more beautiful girls in an hour on\nBroadway than in the whole tour of Europe. Miss Light, now, on Broadway,\nwould excite no particular remark.”\n\n“She has never been there!” cried Roderick, triumphantly.\n\n“I ‘m afraid she never will be there. I suppose you have heard the news\nabout her.”\n\n“What news?” Roderick had stood with his back turned, fiercely poking\nat his lazzarone; but at Mr. Leavenworth’s last words he faced quickly\nabout.\n\n“It ‘s the news of the hour, I believe. Miss Light is admired by the\nhighest people here. They tacitly recognize her superiority. She has had\noffers of marriage from various great lords. I was extremely happy\nto learn this circumstance, and to know that they all had been left\nsighing. She has not been dazzled by their titles and their gilded\ncoronets. She has judged them simply as men, and found them wanting. One\nof them, however, a young Neapolitan prince, I believe, has after a long\nprobation succeeded in making himself acceptable. Miss Light has at last\nsaid yes, and the engagement has just been announced. I am not generally\na retailer of gossip of this description, but the fact was alluded to\nan hour ago by a lady with whom I was conversing, and here, in Europe,\nthese conversational trifles usurp the lion’s share of one’s attention.\nI therefore retained the circumstance. Yes, I regret that Miss Light\nshould marry one of these used-up foreigners. Americans should stand by\neach other. If she wanted a brilliant match we could have fixed it for\nher. If she wanted a fine fellow--a fine, sharp, enterprising modern\nman--I would have undertaken to find him for her without going out of\nthe city of New York. And if she wanted a big fortune, I would have\nfound her twenty that she would have had hard work to spend: money\ndown--not tied up in fever-stricken lands and worm-eaten villas! What is\nthe name of the young man? Prince Castaway, or some such thing!”\n\nIt was well for Mr. Leavenworth that he was a voluminous and\nimperturbable talker; for the current of his eloquence floated him\npast the short, sharp, startled cry with which Roderick greeted his\n“conversational trifle.” The young man stood looking at him with parted\nlips and an excited eye.\n\n“The position of woman,” Mr. Leavenworth placidly resumed, “is certainly\na very degraded one in these countries. I doubt whether a European\nprincess can command the respect which in our country is exhibited\ntoward the obscurest females. The civilization of a country should\nbe measured by the deference shown to the weaker sex. Judged by that\nstandard, where are they, over here?”\n\nThough Mr. Leavenworth had not observed Roderick’s emotion, it was not\nlost upon Rowland, who was making certain uncomfortable reflections upon\nit. He saw that it had instantly become one with the acute irritation\nproduced by the poor gentleman’s oppressive personality, and that\nan explosion of some sort was imminent. Mr. Leavenworth, with calm\nunconsciousness, proceeded to fire the mine.\n\n“And now for our Culture!” he said in the same sonorous tones, demanding\nwith a gesture the unveiling of the figure, which stood somewhat apart,\nmuffled in a great sheet.\n\nRoderick stood looking at him for a moment with concentrated rancor, and\nthen strode to the statue and twitched off the cover. Mr. Leavenworth\nsettled himself into his chair with an air of flattered proprietorship,\nand scanned the unfinished image. “I can conscientiously express myself\nas gratified with the general conception,” he said. “The figure has\nconsiderable majesty, and the countenance wears a fine, open expression.\nThe forehead, however, strikes me as not sufficiently intellectual. In\na statue of Culture, you know, that should be the great point. The eye\nshould instinctively seek the forehead. Could n’t you heighten it up a\nlittle?”\n\nRoderick, for all answer, tossed the sheet back over the statue. “Oblige\nme, sir,” he said, “oblige me! Never mention that thing again.”\n\n“Never mention it? Why my dear sir”--\n\n“Never mention it. It ‘s an abomination!”\n\n“An abomination! My Culture!”\n\n“Yours indeed!” cried Roderick. “It ‘s none of mine. I disown it.”\n\n“Disown it, if you please,” said Mr. Leavenworth sternly, “but finish it\nfirst!”\n\n“I ‘d rather smash it!” cried Roderick.\n\n“This is folly, sir. You must keep your engagements.”\n\n“I made no engagement. A sculptor is n’t a tailor. Did you ever hear of\ninspiration? Mine is dead! And it ‘s no laughing matter. You yourself\nkilled it.”\n\n“I--I--killed your inspiration?” cried Mr. Leavenworth, with the accent\nof righteous wrath. “You ‘re a very ungrateful boy! If ever I encouraged\nand cheered and sustained any one, I ‘m sure I have done so to you.”\n\n“I appreciate your good intentions, and I don’t wish to be uncivil. But\nyour encouragement is--superfluous. I can’t work for you!”\n\n“I call this ill-humor, young man!” said Mr. Leavenworth, as if he had\nfound the damning word.\n\n“Oh, I ‘m in an infernal humor!” Roderick answered.\n\n“Pray, sir, is it my infelicitous allusion to Miss Light’s marriage?”\n\n“It ‘s your infelicitous everything! I don’t say that to offend you;\nI beg your pardon if it does. I say it by way of making our rupture\ncomplete, irretrievable!”\n\nRowland had stood by in silence, but he now interfered. “Listen to me,”\n he said, laying his hand on Roderick’s arm. “You are standing on the\nedge of a gulf. If you suffer anything that has passed to interrupt\nyour work on that figure, you take your plunge. It ‘s no matter that\nyou don’t like it; you will do the wisest thing you ever did if you make\nthat effort of will necessary for finishing it. Destroy the statue then,\nif you like, but make the effort. I speak the truth!”\n\nRoderick looked at him with eyes that still inexorableness made almost\ntender. “You too!” he simply said.\n\nRowland felt that he might as well attempt to squeeze water from a\npolished crystal as hope to move him. He turned away and walked into the\nadjoining room with a sense of sickening helplessness. In a few moments\nhe came back and found that Mr. Leavenworth had departed--presumably in\na manner somewhat portentous. Roderick was sitting with his elbows on\nhis knees and his head in his hands.\n\nRowland made one more attempt. “You decline to think of what I urge?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“There’s one more point--that you shouldn’t, for a month, go to Mrs.\nLight’s.”\n\n“I go there this evening.”\n\n“That too is an utter folly.”\n\n“There are such things as necessary follies.”\n\n“You are not reflecting; you are speaking in passion.”\n\n“Why then do you make me speak?”\n\nRowland meditated a moment. “Is it also necessary that you should lose\nthe best friend you have?”\n\nRoderick looked up. “That ‘s for you to settle!”\n\nHis best friend clapped on his hat and strode away; in a moment the door\nclosed behind him. Rowland walked hard for nearly a couple of hours.\nHe passed up the Corso, out of the Porta del Popolo and into the Villa\nBorghese, of which he made a complete circuit. The keenness of his\nirritation subsided, but it left him with an intolerable weight upon his\nheart. When dusk had fallen, he found himself near the lodging of his\nfriend Madame Grandoni. He frequently paid her a visit during the hour\nwhich preceded dinner, and he now ascended her unillumined staircase and\nrang at her relaxed bell-rope with an especial desire for diversion. He\nwas told that, for the moment, she was occupied, but that if he would\ncome in and wait, she would presently be with him. He had not sat\nmusing in the firelight for ten minutes when he heard the jingle of the\ndoor-bell and then a rustling and murmuring in the hall. The door of the\nlittle saloon opened, but before the visitor appeared he had recognized\nher voice. Christina Light swept forward, preceded by her poodle, and\nalmost filling the narrow parlor with the train of her dress. She was\ncolored here and there by the flicking firelight.\n\n“They told me you were here,” she said simply, as she took a seat.\n\n“And yet you came in? It is very brave,” said Rowland.\n\n“You are the brave one, when one thinks of it! Where is the padrona?”\n\n“Occupied for the moment. But she is coming.”\n\n“How soon?”\n\n“I have already waited ten minutes; I expect her from moment to moment.”\n\n“Meanwhile we are alone?” And she glanced into the dusky corners of the\nroom.\n\n“Unless Stenterello counts,” said Rowland.\n\n“Oh, he knows my secrets--unfortunate brute!” She sat silent awhile,\nlooking into the firelight. Then at last, glancing at Rowland, “Come!\nsay something pleasant!” she exclaimed.\n\n“I have been very happy to hear of your engagement.”\n\n“No, I don’t mean that. I have heard that so often, only since\nbreakfast, that it has lost all sense. I mean some of those unexpected,\ncharming things that you said to me a month ago at Saint Cecilia’s.”\n\n“I offended you, then,” said Rowland. “I was afraid I had.”\n\n“Ah, it occurred to you? Why have n’t I seen you since?”\n\n“Really, I don’t know.” And he began to hesitate for an explanation. “I\nhave called, but you have never been at home.”\n\n“You were careful to choose the wrong times. You have a way with a\npoor girl! You sit down and inform her that she is a person with whom\na respectable young man cannot associate without contamination; your\nfriend is a very nice fellow, you are very careful of his morals, you\nwish him to know none but nice people, and you beg me therefore to\ndesist. You request me to take these suggestions to heart and to act\nupon them as promptly as possible. They are not particularly flattering\nto my vanity. Vanity, however, is a sin, and I listen submissively,\nwith an immense desire to be just. If I have many faults I know it, in\na general way, and I try on the whole to do my best. ‘Voyons,’ I say\nto myself, ‘it is n’t particularly charming to hear one’s self made out\nsuch a low person, but it is worth thinking over; there ‘s probably a\ngood deal of truth in it, and at any rate we must be as good a girl as\nwe can. That ‘s the great point! And then here ‘s a magnificent chance\nfor humility. If there ‘s doubt in the matter, let the doubt count\nagainst one’s self. That is what Saint Catherine did, and Saint Theresa,\nand all the others, and they are said to have had in consequence the\nmost ineffable joys. Let us go in for a little ineffable joy!’ I tried\nit; I swallowed my rising sobs, I made you my courtesy, I determined I\nwould not be spiteful, nor passionate, nor vengeful, nor anything that\nis supposed to be particularly feminine. I was a better girl than\nyou made out--better at least than you thought; but I would let the\ndifference go and do magnificently right, lest I should not do right\nenough. I thought of it a deal for six hours when I know I did n’t seem\nto be, and then at last I did it! Santo Dio!”\n\n“My dear Miss Light, my dear Miss Light!” said Rowland, pleadingly.\n\n“Since then,” the young girl went on, “I have been waiting for the\nineffable joys. They have n’t yet turned up!”\n\n“Pray listen to me!” Rowland urged.\n\n“Nothing, nothing, nothing has come of it. I have passed the dreariest\nmonth of my life!”\n\n“My dear Miss Light, you are a very terrible young lady!” cried Rowland.\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\n“A good many things. We ‘ll talk them over. But first, forgive me if I\nhave offended you!”\n\nShe looked at him a moment, hesitating, and then thrust her hands into\nher muff. “That means nothing. Forgiveness is between equals, and you\ndon’t regard me as your equal.”\n\n“Really, I don’t understand!”\n\nChristina rose and moved for a moment about the room. Then turning\nsuddenly, “You don’t believe in me!” she cried; “not a grain! I don’t\nknow what I would not give to force you to believe in me!”\n\nRowland sprang up, protesting, but before he had time to go far one of\nthe scanty portieres was raised, and Madame Grandoni came in, pulling\nher wig straight. “But you shall believe in me yet,” murmured Christina,\nas she passed toward her hostess.\n\nMadame Grandoni turned tenderly to Christina. “I must give you a very\nsolemn kiss, my dear; you are the heroine of the hour. You have really\naccepted him, eh?”\n\n“So they say!”\n\n“But you ought to know best.”\n\n“I don’t know--I don’t care!” She stood with her hand in Madame\nGrandoni’s, but looking askance at Rowland.\n\n“That ‘s a pretty state of mind,” said the old lady, “for a young person\nwho is going to become a princess.”\n\nChristina shrugged her shoulders. “Every one expects me to go into\necstacies over that! Could anything be more vulgar? They may chuckle by\nthemselves! Will you let me stay to dinner?”\n\n“If you can dine on a risotto. But I imagine you are expected at home.”\n\n“You are right. Prince Casamassima dines there, en famille. But I ‘m not\nin his family, yet!”\n\n“Do you know you are very wicked? I have half a mind not to keep you.”\n\nChristina dropped her eyes, reflectively. “I beg you will let me stay,”\n she said. “If you wish to cure me of my wickedness you must be very\npatient and kind with me. It will be worth the trouble. You must\nshow confidence in me.” And she gave another glance at Rowland. Then\nsuddenly, in a different tone, “I don’t know what I ‘m saying!” she\ncried. “I am weary, I am more lonely than ever, I wish I were dead!” The\ntears rose to her eyes, she struggled with them an instant, and buried\nher face in her muff; but at last she burst into uncontrollable sobs\nand flung her arms upon Madame Grandoni’s neck. This shrewd woman gave\nRowland a significant nod, and a little shrug, over the young girl’s\nbeautiful bowed head, and then led Christina tenderly away into the\nadjoining room. Rowland, left alone, stood there for an instant,\nintolerably puzzled, face to face with Miss Light’s poodle, who had set\nup a sharp, unearthly cry of sympathy with his mistress. Rowland\nvented his confusion in dealing a rap with his stick at the animal’s\nunmelodious muzzle, and then rapidly left the house. He saw Mrs. Light’s\ncarriage waiting at the door, and heard afterwards that Christina went\nhome to dinner.\n\nA couple of days later he went, for a fortnight, to Florence. He had\ntwenty minds to leave Italy altogether; and at Florence he could at\nleast more freely decide upon his future movements. He felt profoundly,\nincurably disgusted. Reflective benevolence stood prudently aside, and\nfor the time touched the source of his irritation with no softening\nside-lights.\n\nIt was the middle of March, and by the middle of March in Florence the\nspring is already warm and deep. He had an infinite relish for the place\nand the season, but as he strolled by the Arno and paused here and there\nin the great galleries, they failed to soothe his irritation. He was\nsore at heart, and as the days went by the soreness deepened rather than\nhealed. He felt as if he had a complaint against fortune; good-natured\nas he was, his good-nature this time quite declined to let it pass. He\nhad tried to be wise, he had tried to be kind, he had embarked upon an\nestimable enterprise; but his wisdom, his kindness, his energy, had been\nthrown back in his face. He was disappointed, and his disappointment\nhad an angry spark in it. The sense of wasted time, of wasted hope and\nfaith, kept him constant company. There were times when the beautiful\nthings about him only exasperated his discontent. He went to the Pitti\nPalace, and Raphael’s Madonna of the Chair seemed, in its soft serenity,\nto mock him with the suggestion of unattainable repose. He lingered on\nthe bridges at sunset, and knew that the light was enchanting and the\nmountains divine, but there seemed to be something horribly invidious\nand unwelcome in the fact. He felt, in a word, like a man who has been\ncruelly defrauded and who wishes to have his revenge. Life owed him, he\nthought, a compensation, and he would be restless and resentful until he\nfound it. He knew--or he seemed to know--where he should find it; but he\nhardly told himself, and thought of the thing under mental protest, as a\nman in want of money may think of certain funds that he holds in trust.\nIn his melancholy meditations the idea of something better than all\nthis, something that might softly, richly interpose, something that\nmight reconcile him to the future, something that might make one’s\ntenure of life deep and zealous instead of harsh and uneven--the idea of\nconcrete compensation, in a word--shaped itself sooner or later into the\nimage of Mary Garland.\n\nVery odd, you may say, that at this time of day Rowland should still\nbe brooding over a plain girl of whom he had had but the lightest of\nglimpses two years before; very odd that so deep an impression should\nhave been made by so lightly-pressed an instrument. We must admit the\noddity and offer simply in explanation that his sentiment apparently\nbelonged to that species of emotion of which, by the testimony of the\npoets, the very name and essence is oddity. One night he slept but\nhalf an hour; he found his thoughts taking a turn which excited him\nportentously. He walked up and down his room half the night. It looked\nout on the Arno; the noise of the river came in at the open window; he\nfelt like dressing and going down into the streets. Toward morning\nhe flung himself into a chair; though he was wide awake he was less\nexcited. It seemed to him that he saw his idea from the outside, that he\njudged it and condemned it; yet it stood there before him, distinct,\nand in a certain way imperious. During the day he tried to banish it\nand forget it; but it fascinated, haunted, at moments frightened him. He\ntried to amuse himself, paid visits, resorted to several rather violent\ndevices for diverting his thoughts. If on the morrow he had committed a\ncrime, the persons whom he had seen that day would have testified\nthat he had talked strangely and had not seemed like himself. He felt\ncertainly very unlike himself; long afterwards, in retrospect, he used\nto reflect that during those days he had for a while been literally\nbeside himself. His idea persisted; it clung to him like a sturdy\nbeggar. The sense of the matter, roughly expressed, was this: If\nRoderick was really going, as he himself had phrased it, to “fizzle\nout,” one might help him on the way--one might smooth the descensus\nAverno. For forty-eight hours there swam before Rowland’s eyes a vision\nof Roderick, graceful and beautiful as he passed, plunging, like a\ndiver, from an eminence into a misty gulf. The gulf was destruction,\nannihilation, death; but if death was decreed, why should not the agony\nbe brief? Beyond this vision there faintly glimmered another, as in the\nchildren’s game of the “magic lantern” a picture is superposed on the\nwhite wall before the last one has quite faded. It represented Mary\nGarland standing there with eyes in which the horror seemed slowly,\nslowly to expire, and hanging, motionless hands which at last made no\nresistance when his own offered to take them. When, of old, a man was\nburnt at the stake it was cruel to have to be present; but if one was\npresent it was kind to lend a hand to pile up the fuel and make the\nflames do their work quickly and the smoke muffle up the victim. With\nall deference to your kindness, this was perhaps an obligation you would\nespecially feel if you had a reversionary interest in something the\nvictim was to leave behind him.\n\nOne morning, in the midst of all this, Rowland walked heedlessly out of\none of the city gates and found himself on the road to Fiesole. It was a\ncompletely lovely day; the March sun felt like May, as the English poet\nof Florence says; the thick-blossomed shrubs and vines that hung over\nthe walls of villa and podere flung their odorous promise into the warm,\nstill air. Rowland followed the winding, climbing lanes; lingered, as he\ngot higher, beneath the rusty cypresses, beside the low parapets, where\nyou look down on the charming city and sweep the vale of the Arno;\nreached the little square before the cathedral, and rested awhile in the\nmassive, dusky church; then climbed higher, to the Franciscan convent\nwhich is poised on the very apex of the mountain. He rang at the little\ngateway; a shabby, senile, red-faced brother admitted him with almost\nmaudlin friendliness. There was a dreary chill in the chapel and the\ncorridors, and he passed rapidly through them into the delightfully\nsteep and tangled old garden which runs wild over the forehead of the\ngreat hill. He had been in it before, and he was very fond of it. The\ngarden hangs in the air, and you ramble from terrace to terrace and\nwonder how it keeps from slipping down, in full consummation of its\nbereaved forlornness, into the nakedly romantic gorge beneath. It was\njust noon when Rowland went in, and after roaming about awhile he flung\nhimself in the sun on a mossy stone bench and pulled his hat over his\neyes. The short shadows of the brown-coated cypresses above him had\ngrown very long, and yet he had not passed back through the convent. One\nof the monks, in his faded snuff-colored robe, came wandering out into\nthe garden, reading his greasy little breviary. Suddenly he came toward\nthe bench on which Rowland had stretched himself, and paused a moment,\nattentively. Rowland was lingering there still; he was sitting with his\nhead in his hands and his elbows on his knees. He seemed not to have\nheard the sandaled tread of the good brother, but as the monk remained\nwatching him, he at last looked up. It was not the ignoble old man who\nhad admitted him, but a pale, gaunt personage, of a graver and more\nascetic, and yet of a benignant, aspect. Rowland’s face bore the traces\nof extreme trouble. The frate kept his finger in his little book,\nand folded his arms picturesquely across his breast. It can hardly be\ndetermined whether his attitude, as he bent his sympathetic Italian\neye upon Rowland, was a happy accident or the result of an exquisite\nspiritual discernment. To Rowland, at any rate, under the emotion of\nthat moment, it seemed blessedly opportune. He rose and approached the\nmonk, and laid his hand on his arm.\n\n“My brother,” he said, “did you ever see the Devil?”\n\nThe frate gazed, gravely, and crossed himself. “Heaven forbid!”\n\n“He was here,” Rowland went on, “here in this lovely garden, as he was\nonce in Paradise, half an hour ago. But have no fear; I drove him out.”\n And Rowland stooped and picked up his hat, which had rolled away into a\nbed of cyclamen, in vague symbolism of an actual physical tussle.\n\n“You have been tempted, my brother?” asked the friar, tenderly.\n\n“Hideously!”\n\n“And you have resisted--and conquered!”\n\n“I believe I have conquered.”\n\n“The blessed Saint Francis be praised! It is well done. If you like, we\nwill offer a mass for you.”\n\n“I am not a Catholic,” said Rowland.\n\nThe frate smiled with dignity. “That is a reason the more.”\n\n“But it ‘s for you, then, to choose. Shake hands with me,” Rowland\nadded; “that will do as well; and suffer me, as I go out, to stop a\nmoment in your chapel.”\n\nThey shook hands and separated. The frate crossed himself, opened his\nbook, and wandered away, in relief against the western sky. Rowland\npassed back into the convent, and paused long enough in the chapel to\nlook for the alms-box. He had had what is vulgarly termed a great scare;\nhe believed, very poignantly for the time, in the Devil, and he felt an\nirresistible need to subscribe to any institution which engaged to keep\nhim at a distance.\n\nThe next day he returned to Rome, and the day afterwards he went in\nsearch of Roderick. He found him on the Pincian with his back turned to\nthe crowd, looking at the sunset. “I went to Florence,” Rowland said,\n“and I thought of going farther; but I came back on purpose to give you\nanother piece of advice. Once more, you refuse to leave Rome?”\n\n“Never!” said Roderick.\n\n“The only chance that I see, then, of your reviving your sense of\nresponsibility to--to those various sacred things you have forgotten, is\nin sending for your mother to join you here.”\n\nRoderick stared. “For my mother?”\n\n“For your mother--and for Miss Garland.”\n\nRoderick still stared; and then, slowly and faintly, his face flushed.\n“For Mary Garland--for my mother?” he repeated. “Send for them?”\n\n“Tell me this; I have often wondered, but till now I have forborne to\nask. You are still engaged to Miss Garland?”\n\nRoderick frowned darkly, but assented.\n\n“It would give you pleasure, then, to see her?”\n\nRoderick turned away and for some moments answered nothing. “Pleasure!”\n he said at last, huskily. “Call it pain.”\n\n“I regard you as a sick man,” Rowland continued. “In such a case Miss\nGarland would say that her place was at your side.”\n\nRoderick looked at him some time askance, mistrustfully. “Is this a\ndeep-laid snare?” he asked slowly.\n\nRowland had come back with all his patience rekindled, but these words\ngave it an almost fatal chill. “Heaven forgive you!” he cried bitterly.\n“My idea has been simply this. Try, in decency, to understand it. I have\ntried to befriend you, to help you, to inspire you with confidence,\nand I have failed. I took you from the hands of your mother and your\nbetrothed, and it seemed to me my duty to restore you to their hands.\nThat ‘s all I have to say.”\n\nHe was going, but Roderick forcibly detained him. It would have been\nbut a rough way of expressing it to say that one could never know how\nRoderick would take a thing. It had happened more than once that when\nhit hard, deservedly, he had received the blow with touching gentleness.\nOn the other hand, he had often resented the softest taps. The secondary\neffect of Rowland’s present admonition seemed reassuring. “I beg you to\nwait,” he said, “to forgive that shabby speech, and to let me reflect.”\n And he walked up and down awhile, reflecting. At last he stopped, with\na look in his face that Rowland had not seen all winter. It was a\nstrikingly beautiful look.\n\n“How strange it is,” he said, “that the simplest devices are the last\nthat occur to one!” And he broke into a light laugh. “To see Mary\nGarland is just what I want. And my mother--my mother can’t hurt me\nnow.”\n\n“You will write, then?”\n\n“I will telegraph. They must come, at whatever cost. Striker can arrange\nit all for them.”\n\nIn a couple of days he told Rowland that he had received a telegraphic\nanswer to his message, informing him that the two ladies were to sail\nimmediately for Leghorn, in one of the small steamers which ply between\nthat port and New York. They would arrive, therefore, in less than a\nmonth. Rowland passed this month of expectation in no very serene frame\nof mind. His suggestion had had its source in the deepest places of his\nagitated conscience; but there was something intolerable in the thought\nof the suffering to which the event was probably subjecting those\nundefended women. They had scraped together their scanty funds and\nembarked, at twenty-four hours’ notice, upon the dreadful sea, to\njourney tremulously to shores darkened by the shadow of deeper alarms.\nHe could only promise himself to be their devoted friend and servant.\nPreoccupied as he was, he was able to observe that expectation,\nwith Roderick, took a form which seemed singular even among his\ncharacteristic singularities. If redemption--Roderick seemed to\nreason--was to arrive with his mother and his affianced bride, these\nlast moments of error should be doubly erratic. He did nothing; but\ninaction, with him, took on an unwonted air of gentle gayety. He laughed\nand whistled and went often to Mrs. Light’s; though Rowland knew not\nin what fashion present circumstances had modified his relations with\nChristina. The month ebbed away and Rowland daily expected to hear from\nRoderick that he had gone to Leghorn to meet the ship. He heard nothing,\nand late one evening, not having seen his friend in three or four days,\nhe stopped at Roderick’s lodging to assure himself that he had gone at\nlast. A cab was standing in the street, but as it was a couple of doors\noff he hardly heeded it. The hall at the foot of the staircase was dark,\nlike most Roman halls, and he paused in the street-doorway on hearing\nthe advancing footstep of a person with whom he wished to avoid coming\ninto collision. While he did so he heard another footstep behind him,\nand turning round found that Roderick in person had just overtaken him.\nAt the same moment a woman’s figure advanced from within, into the light\nof the street-lamp, and a face, half-startled, glanced at him out of\nthe darkness. He gave a cry--it was the face of Mary Garland. Her glance\nflew past him to Roderick, and in a second a startled exclamation broke\nfrom her own lips. It made Rowland turn again. Roderick stood there,\npale, apparently trying to speak, but saying nothing. His lips were\nparted and he was wavering slightly with a strange movement--the\nmovement of a man who has drunk too much. Then Rowland’s eyes met Miss\nGarland’s again, and her own, which had rested a moment on Roderick’s,\nwere formidable!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Mary Garland\n\nHow it befell that Roderick had failed to be in Leghorn on his mother’s\narrival never clearly transpired; for he undertook to give no elaborate\nexplanation of his fault. He never indulged in professions (touching\npersonal conduct) as to the future, or in remorse as to the past, and\nas he would have asked no praise if he had traveled night and day to\nembrace his mother as she set foot on shore, he made (in Rowland’s\npresence, at least) no apology for having left her to come in search of\nhim. It was to be said that, thanks to an unprecedentedly fine season,\nthe voyage of the two ladies had been surprisingly rapid, and that,\naccording to common probabilities, if Roderick had left Rome on the\nmorrow (as he declared that he had intended), he would have had a day or\ntwo of waiting at Leghorn. Rowland’s silent inference was that\nChristina Light had beguiled him into letting the time slip, and it was\naccompanied with a silent inquiry whether she had done so unconsciously\nor maliciously. He had told her, presumably, that his mother and his\ncousin were about to arrive; and it was pertinent to remember hereupon\nthat she was a young lady of mysterious impulses. Rowland heard in due\ntime the story of the adventures of the two ladies from Northampton.\nMiss Garland’s wish, at Leghorn, on finding they were left at the mercy\nof circumstances, had been to telegraph to Roderick and await an\nanswer; for she knew that their arrival was a trifle premature. But Mrs.\nHudson’s maternal heart had taken the alarm. Roderick’s sending for them\nwas, to her imagination, a confession of illness, and his not being\nat Leghorn, a proof of it; an hour’s delay was therefore cruel both to\nherself and to him. She insisted on immediate departure; and, unskilled\nas they were in the mysteries of foreign (or even of domestic) travel,\nthey had hurried in trembling eagerness to Rome. They had arrived late\nin the evening, and, knowing nothing of inns, had got into a cab\nand proceeded to Roderick’s lodging. At the door, poor Mrs. Hudson’s\nfrightened anxiety had overcome her, and she had sat quaking and crying\nin the vehicle, too weak to move. Miss Garland had bravely gone in,\ngroped her way up the dusky staircase, reached Roderick’s door, and,\nwith the assistance of such acquaintance with the Italian tongue as she\nhad culled from a phrase-book during the calmer hours of the voyage,\nhad learned from the old woman who had her cousin’s household economy in\ncharge that he was in the best of health and spirits, and had gone forth\na few hours before with his hat on his ear, per divertirsi.\n\nThese things Rowland learned during a visit he paid the two ladies the\nevening after their arrival. Mrs. Hudson spoke of them at great length\nand with an air of clinging confidence in Rowland which told him how\nfaithfully time had served him, in her imagination. But her fright was\nover, though she was still catching her breath a little, like a person\ndragged ashore out of waters uncomfortably deep. She was excessively\nbewildered and confused, and seemed more than ever to demand a tender\nhandling from her friends. Before Miss Garland, Rowland was distinctly\nconscious that he trembled. He wondered extremely what was going on in\nher mind; what was her silent commentary on the incidents of the night\nbefore. He wondered all the more, because he immediately perceived that\nshe was greatly changed since their parting, and that the change was by\nno means for the worse. She was older, easier, more free, more like\na young woman who went sometimes into company. She had more beauty\nas well, inasmuch as her beauty before had been the depth of her\nexpression, and the sources from which this beauty was fed had in\nthese two years evidently not wasted themselves. Rowland felt almost\ninstantly--he could hardly have said why: it was in her voice, in her\ntone, in the air--that a total change had passed over her attitude\ntowards himself. She trusted him now, absolutely; whether or no she\nliked him, she believed he was solid. He felt that during the coming\nweeks he would need to be solid. Mrs. Hudson was at one of the smaller\nhotels, and her sitting-room was frugally lighted by a couple of\ncandles. Rowland made the most of this dim illumination to try to detect\nthe afterglow of that frightened flash from Miss Garland’s eyes\nthe night before. It had been but a flash, for what provoked it had\ninstantly vanished. Rowland had murmured a rapturous blessing on\nRoderick’s head, as he perceived him instantly apprehend the situation.\nIf he had been drinking, its gravity sobered him on the spot; in a\nsingle moment he collected his wits. The next moment, with a ringing,\njovial cry, he was folding the young girl in his arms, and the next\nhe was beside his mother’s carriage, half smothered in her sobs and\ncaresses. Rowland had recommended a hotel close at hand, and had then\ndiscreetly withdrawn. Roderick was at this time doing his part superbly,\nand Miss Garland’s brow was serene. It was serene now, twenty-four hours\nlater; but nevertheless, her alarm had lasted an appreciable moment.\nWhat had become of it? It had dropped down deep into her memory, and\nit was lying there for the present in the shade. But with another\nweek, Rowland said to himself, it would leap erect again; the lightest\nfriction would strike a spark from it. Rowland thought he had schooled\nhimself to face the issue of Mary Garland’s advent, casting it even in\na tragical phase; but in her personal presence--in which he found a\npoignant mixture of the familiar and the strange--he seemed to face\nit and all that it might bring with it for the first time. In vulgar\nparlance, he stood uneasy in his shoes. He felt like walking on tiptoe,\nnot to arouse the sleeping shadows. He felt, indeed, almost like saying\nthat they might have their own way later, if they would only allow\nto these first few days the clear light of ardent contemplation. For\nRowland at last was ardent, and all the bells within his soul were\nringing bravely in jubilee. Roderick, he learned, had been the whole\nday with his mother, and had evidently responded to her purest trust.\nHe appeared to her appealing eyes still unspotted by the world. That\nis what it is, thought Rowland, to be “gifted,” to escape not only the\nsuperficial, but the intrinsic penalties of misconduct. The two ladies\nhad spent the day within doors, resting from the fatigues of travel.\nMiss Garland, Rowland suspected, was not so fatigued as she suffered\nit to be assumed. She had remained with Mrs. Hudson, to attend to her\npersonal wants, which the latter seemed to think, now that she was in\na foreign land, with a southern climate and a Catholic religion, would\nforthwith become very complex and formidable, though as yet they had\nsimply resolved themselves into a desire for a great deal of tea and for\na certain extremely familiar old black and white shawl across her feet,\nas she lay on the sofa. But the sense of novelty was evidently strong\nupon Miss Garland, and the light of expectation was in her eye. She was\nrestless and excited; she moved about the room and went often to the\nwindow; she was observing keenly; she watched the Italian servants\nintently, as they came and went; she had already had a long colloquy\nwith the French chambermaid, who had expounded her views on the Roman\nquestion; she noted the small differences in the furniture, in the food,\nin the sounds that came in from the street. Rowland felt, in all this,\nthat her intelligence, here, would have a great unfolding. He wished\nimmensely he might have a share in it; he wished he might show her Rome.\nThat, of course, would be Roderick’s office. But he promised himself at\nleast to take advantage of off-hours.\n\n“It behooves you to appreciate your good fortune,” he said to her. “To\nbe young and elastic, and yet old enough and wise enough to discriminate\nand reflect, and to come to Italy for the first time--that is one of the\ngreatest pleasures that life offers us. It is but right to remind you of\nit, so that you make the most of opportunity and do not accuse yourself,\nlater, of having wasted the precious season.”\n\nMiss Garland looked at him, smiling intently, and went to the window\nagain. “I expect to enjoy it,” she said. “Don’t be afraid; I am not\nwasteful.”\n\n“I am afraid we are not qualified, you know,” said Mrs. Hudson. “We are\ntold that you must know so much, that you must have read so many books.\nOur taste has not been cultivated. When I was a young lady at school, I\nremember I had a medal, with a pink ribbon, for ‘proficiency in Ancient\nHistory’--the seven kings, or is it the seven hills? and Quintus Curtius\nand Julius Caesar and--and that period, you know. I believe I have my\nmedal somewhere in a drawer, now, but I have forgotten all about the\nkings. But after Roderick came to Italy we tried to learn something\nabout it. Last winter Mary used to read ‘Corinne’ to me in the evenings,\nand in the mornings she used to read another book, to herself. What was\nit, Mary, that book that was so long, you know,--in fifteen volumes?”\n\n“It was Sismondi’s Italian Republics,” said Mary, simply.\n\nRowland could not help laughing; whereupon Mary blushed. “Did you finish\nit?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, and began another--a shorter one--Roscoe’s Leo the Tenth.”\n\n“Did you find them interesting?”\n\n“Oh yes.”\n\n“Do you like history?”\n\n“Some of it.”\n\n“That ‘s a woman’s answer! And do you like art?”\n\nShe paused a moment. “I have never seen it!”\n\n“You have great advantages, now, my dear, with Roderick and Mr. Mallet,”\n said Mrs. Hudson. “I am sure no young lady ever had such advantages. You\ncome straight to the highest authorities. Roderick, I suppose, will show\nyou the practice of art, and Mr. Mallet, perhaps, if he will be so\ngood, will show you the theory. As an artist’s wife, you ought to know\nsomething about it.”\n\n“One learns a good deal about it, here, by simply living,” said Rowland;\n“by going and coming about one’s daily avocations.”\n\n“Dear, dear, how wonderful that we should be here in the midst of it!”\n murmured Mrs. Hudson. “To think of art being out there in the streets!\nWe did n’t see much of it last evening, as we drove from the depot. But\nthe streets were so dark and we were so frightened! But we are very easy\nnow; are n’t we, Mary?”\n\n“I am very happy,” said Mary, gravely, and wandered back to the window\nagain.\n\nRoderick came in at this moment and kissed his mother, and then\nwent over and joined Miss Garland. Rowland sat with Mrs. Hudson, who\nevidently had a word which she deemed of some value for his private ear.\nShe followed Roderick with intensely earnest eyes.\n\n“I wish to tell you, sir,” she said, “how very grateful--how very\nthankful--what a happy mother I am! I feel as if I owed it all to you,\nsir. To find my poor boy so handsome, so prosperous, so elegant, so\nfamous--and ever to have doubted of you! What must you think of me? You\n‘re our guardian angel, sir. I often say so to Mary.”\n\nRowland wore, in response to this speech, a rather haggard brow. He\ncould only murmur that he was glad she found Roderick looking well.\nHe had of course promptly asked himself whether the best discretion\ndictated that he should give her a word of warning--just turn the handle\nof the door through which, later, disappointment might enter. He had\ndetermined to say nothing, but simply to wait in silence for Roderick to\nfind effective inspiration in those confidently expectant eyes. It was\nto be supposed that he was seeking for it now; he remained sometime at\nthe window with his cousin. But at last he turned away and came over to\nthe fireside with a contraction of the eyebrows which seemed to\nintimate that Miss Garland’s influence was for the moment, at least,\nnot soothing. She presently followed him, and for an instant Rowland\nobserved her watching him as if she thought him strange. “Strange\nenough,” thought Rowland, “he may seem to her, if he will!” Roderick\ndirected his glance to his friend with a certain peremptory air,\nwhich--roughly interpreted--was equivalent to a request to share the\nintellectual expense of entertaining the ladies. “Good heavens!” Rowland\ncried within himself; “is he already tired of them?”\n\n“To-morrow, of course, we must begin to put you through the mill,”\n Roderick said to his mother. “And be it hereby known to Mallet that we\ncount upon him to turn the wheel.”\n\n“I will do as you please, my son,” said Mrs. Hudson. “So long as I have\nyou with me I don’t care where I go. We must not take up too much of Mr.\nMallet’s time.”\n\n“His time is inexhaustible; he has nothing under the sun to do. Have\nyou, Rowland? If you had seen the big hole I have been making in it!\nWhere will you go first? You have your choice--from the Scala Santa to\nthe Cloaca Maxima.”\n\n“Let us take things in order,” said Rowland. “We will go first to Saint\nPeter’s. Miss Garland, I hope you are impatient to see Saint Peter’s.”\n\n“I would like to go first to Roderick’s studio,” said Miss Garland.\n\n“It ‘s a very nasty place,” said Roderick. “At your pleasure!”\n\n“Yes, we must see your beautiful things before we can look contentedly\nat anything else,” said Mrs. Hudson.\n\n“I have no beautiful things,” said Roderick. “You may see what there is!\nWhat makes you look so odd?”\n\nThis inquiry was abruptly addressed to his mother, who, in response,\nglanced appealingly at Mary and raised a startled hand to her smooth\nhair.\n\n“No, it ‘s your face,” said Roderick. “What has happened to it these two\nyears? It has changed its expression.”\n\n“Your mother has prayed a great deal,” said Miss Garland, simply.\n\n“I did n’t suppose, of course, it was from doing anything bad! It makes\nyou a very good face--very interesting, very solemn. It has very fine\nlines in it; something might be done with it.” And Rowland held one of\nthe candles near the poor lady’s head.\n\nShe was covered with confusion. “My son, my son,” she said with dignity,\n“I don’t understand you.”\n\nIn a flash all his old alacrity had come to him. “I suppose a man may\nadmire his own mother!” he cried. “If you please, madame, you ‘ll sit to\nme for that head. I see it, I see it! I will make something that a queen\ncan’t get done for her.”\n\nRowland respectfully urged her to assent; he saw Roderick was in the\nvein and would probably do something eminently original. She gave\nher promise, at last, after many soft, inarticulate protests and a\nfrightened petition that she might be allowed to keep her knitting.\n\nRowland returned the next day, with plenty of zeal for the part Roderick\nhad assigned to him. It had been arranged that they should go to Saint\nPeter’s. Roderick was in high good-humor, and, in the carriage, was\nwatching his mother with a fine mixture of filial and professional\ntenderness. Mrs. Hudson looked up mistrustfully at the tall, shabby\nhouses, and grasped the side of the barouche in her hand, as if she\nwere in a sail-boat, in dangerous waters. Rowland sat opposite to Miss\nGarland. She was totally oblivious of her companions; from the moment\nthe carriage left the hotel, she sat gazing, wide-eyed and absorbed, at\nthe objects about them. If Rowland had felt disposed he might have made\na joke of her intense seriousness. From time to time he told her the\nname of a place or a building, and she nodded, without looking at him.\nWhen they emerged into the great square between Bernini’s colonnades,\nshe laid her hand on Mrs. Hudson’s arm and sank back in the carriage,\nstaring up at the vast yellow facade of the church. Inside the\nchurch, Roderick gave his arm to his mother, and Rowland constituted\nhimself the especial guide of Miss Garland. He walked with her slowly\neverywhere, and made the entire circuit, telling her all he knew of\nthe history of the building. This was a great deal, but she listened\nattentively, keeping her eyes fixed on the dome. To Rowland himself\nit had never seemed so radiantly sublime as at these moments; he felt\nalmost as if he had contrived it himself and had a right to be proud of\nit. He left Miss Garland a while on the steps of the choir, where she\nhad seated herself to rest, and went to join their companions. Mrs.\nHudson was watching a great circle of tattered contadini, who were\nkneeling before the image of Saint Peter. The fashion of their tatters\nfascinated her; she stood gazing at them in a sort of terrified pity,\nand could not be induced to look at anything else. Rowland went back to\nMiss Garland and sat down beside her.\n\n“Well, what do you think of Europe?” he asked, smiling.\n\n“I think it ‘s horrible!” she said abruptly.\n\n“Horrible?”\n\n“I feel so strangely--I could almost cry.”\n\n“How is it that you feel?”\n\n“So sorry for the poor past, that seems to have died here, in my heart,\nin an hour!”\n\n“But, surely, you ‘re pleased--you ‘re interested.”\n\n“I am overwhelmed. Here in a single hour, everything is changed. It is\nas if a wall in my mind had been knocked down at a stroke. Before me\nlies an immense new world, and it makes the old one, the poor little\nnarrow, familiar one I have always known, seem pitiful.”\n\n“But you did n’t come to Rome to keep your eyes fastened on that narrow\nlittle world. Forget it, turn your back on it, and enjoy all this.”\n\n“I want to enjoy it; but as I sat here just now, looking up at that\ngolden mist in the dome, I seemed to see in it the vague shapes of\ncertain people and things at home. To enjoy, as you say, as these things\ndemand of one to enjoy them, is to break with one’s past. And breaking\nis a pain!”\n\n“Don’t mind the pain, and it will cease to trouble you. Enjoy, enjoy; it\nis your duty. Yours especially!”\n\n“Why mine especially?”\n\n“Because I am very sure that you have a mind capable of doing the\nmost liberal justice to everything interesting and beautiful. You are\nextremely intelligent.”\n\n“You don’t know,” said Miss Garland, simply.\n\n“In that matter one feels. I really think that I know better than you.\nI don’t want to seem patronizing, but I suspect that your mind is\nsusceptible of a great development. Give it the best company, trust it,\nlet it go!”\n\nShe looked away from him for some moments, down the gorgeous vista of\nthe great church. “But what you say,” she said at last, “means change!”\n\n“Change for the better!” cried Rowland.\n\n“How can one tell? As one stands, one knows the worst. It seems to me\nvery frightful to develop,” she added, with her complete smile.\n\n“One is in for it in one way or another, and one might as well do it\nwith a good grace as with a bad! Since one can’t escape life, it is\nbetter to take it by the hand.”\n\n“Is this what you call life?” she asked.\n\n“What do you mean by ‘this’?”\n\n“Saint Peter’s--all this splendor, all Rome--pictures, ruins, statues,\nbeggars, monks.”\n\n“It is not all of it, but it is a large part of it. All these things\nare impregnated with life; they are the fruits of an old and complex\ncivilization.”\n\n“An old and complex civilization: I am afraid I don’t like that.”\n\n“Don’t conclude on that point just yet. Wait till you have tested\nit. While you wait, you will see an immense number of very beautiful\nthings--things that you are made to understand. They won’t leave you as\nthey found you; then you can judge. Don’t tell me I know nothing about\nyour understanding. I have a right to assume it.”\n\nMiss Garland gazed awhile aloft in the dome. “I am not sure I understand\nthat,” she said.\n\n“I hope, at least, that at a cursory glance it pleases you,” said\nRowland. “You need n’t be afraid to tell the truth. What strikes some\npeople is that it is so remarkably small.”\n\n“Oh, it’s large enough; it’s very wonderful. There are things in Rome,\nthen,” she added in a moment, turning and looking at him, “that are\nvery, very beautiful?”\n\n“Lots of them.”\n\n“Some of the most beautiful things in the world?”\n\n“Unquestionably.”\n\n“What are they? which things have most beauty?”\n\n“That is according to taste. I should say the statues.”\n\n“How long will it take to see them all? to know, at least, something\nabout them?”\n\n“You can see them all, as far as mere seeing goes, in a fortnight. But\nto know them is a thing for one’s leisure. The more time you spend among\nthem, the more you care for them.” After a moment’s hesitation he went\non: “Why should you grudge time? It ‘s all in your way, since you are to\nbe an artist’s wife.”\n\n“I have thought of that,” she said. “It may be that I shall always live\nhere, among the most beautiful things in the world!”\n\n“Very possibly! I should like to see you ten years hence.”\n\n“I dare say I shall seem greatly altered. But I am sure of one thing.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“That for the most part I shall be quite the same. I ask nothing better\nthan to believe the fine things you say about my understanding, but even\nif they are true, it won’t matter. I shall be what I was made, what I am\nnow--a young woman from the country! The fruit of a civilization not old\nand complex, but new and simple.”\n\n“I am delighted to hear it: that ‘s an excellent foundation.”\n\n“Perhaps, if you show me anything more, you will not always think so\nkindly of it. Therefore I warn you.”\n\n“I am not frightened. I should like vastly to say something to you: Be\nwhat you are, be what you choose; but do, sometimes, as I tell you.”\n\nIf Rowland was not frightened, neither, perhaps, was Miss Garland; but\nshe seemed at least slightly disturbed. She proposed that they should\njoin their companions.\n\nMrs. Hudson spoke under her breath; she could not be accused of the want\nof reverence sometimes attributed to Protestants in the great Catholic\ntemples. “Mary, dear,” she whispered, “suppose we had to kiss that\ndreadful brass toe. If I could only have kept our door-knocker, at\nNorthampton, as bright as that! I think it’s so heathenish; but Roderick\nsays he thinks it ‘s sublime.”\n\nRoderick had evidently grown a trifle perverse. “It ‘s sublimer than\nanything that your religion asks you to do!” he exclaimed.\n\n“Surely our religion sometimes gives us very difficult duties,” said\nMiss Garland.\n\n“The duty of sitting in a whitewashed meeting-house and listening to a\nnasal Puritan! I admit that ‘s difficult. But it ‘s not sublime. I am\nspeaking of ceremonies, of forms. It is in my line, you know, to make\nmuch of forms. I think this is a very beautiful one. Could n’t you do\nit?” he demanded, looking at his cousin.\n\nShe looked back at him intently and then shook her head. “I think not!”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“I don’t know; I could n’t!”\n\nDuring this little discussion our four friends were standing near the\nvenerable image of Saint Peter, and a squalid, savage-looking peasant,\na tattered ruffian of the most orthodox Italian aspect, had been\nperforming his devotions before it. He turned away, crossing himself,\nand Mrs. Hudson gave a little shudder of horror.\n\n“After that,” she murmured, “I suppose he thinks he is as good as any\none! And here is another. Oh, what a beautiful person!”\n\nA young lady had approached the sacred effigy, after having wandered\naway from a group of companions. She kissed the brazen toe, touched it\nwith her forehead, and turned round, facing our friends. Rowland then\nrecognized Christina Light. He was stupefied: had she suddenly embraced\nthe Catholic faith? It was but a few weeks before that she had treated\nhim to a passionate profession of indifference. Had she entered the\nchurch to put herself en regle with what was expected of a Princess\nCasamassima? While Rowland was mentally asking these questions she was\napproaching him and his friends, on her way to the great altar. At first\nshe did not perceive them.\n\nMary Garland had been gazing at her. “You told me,” she said gently, to\nRowland, “that Rome contained some of the most beautiful things in the\nworld. This surely is one of them!”\n\nAt this moment Christina’s eye met Rowland’s and before giving him\nany sign of recognition she glanced rapidly at his companions. She saw\nRoderick, but she gave him no bow; she looked at Mrs. Hudson, she looked\nat Mary Garland. At Mary Garland she looked fixedly, piercingly, from\nhead to foot, as the slow pace at which she was advancing made possible.\nThen suddenly, as if she had perceived Roderick for the first time,\nshe gave him a charming nod, a radiant smile. In a moment he was at her\nside. She stopped, and he stood talking to her; she continued to look at\nMiss Garland.\n\n“Why, Roderick knows her!” cried Mrs. Hudson, in an awe-struck whisper.\n“I supposed she was some great princess.”\n\n“She is--almost!” said Rowland. “She is the most beautiful girl in\nEurope, and Roderick has made her bust.”\n\n“Her bust? Dear, dear!” murmured Mrs. Hudson, vaguely shocked. “What a\nstrange bonnet!”\n\n“She has very strange eyes,” said Mary, and turned away.\n\nThe two ladies, with Rowland, began to descend toward the door of the\nchurch. On their way they passed Mrs. Light, the Cavaliere, and the\npoodle, and Rowland informed his companions of the relation in which\nthese personages stood to Roderick’s young lady.\n\n“Think of it, Mary!” said Mrs. Hudson. “What splendid people he must\nknow! No wonder he found Northampton dull!”\n\n“I like the poor little old gentleman,” said Mary.\n\n“Why do you call him poor?” Rowland asked, struck with the observation.\n\n“He seems so!” she answered simply.\n\nAs they were reaching the door they were overtaken by Roderick, whose\ninterview with Miss Light had perceptibly brightened his eye. “So you\nare acquainted with princesses!” said his mother softly, as they passed\ninto the portico.\n\n“Miss Light is not a princess!” said Roderick, curtly.\n\n“But Mr. Mallet says so,” urged Mrs. Hudson, rather disappointed.\n\n“I meant that she was going to be!” said Rowland.\n\n“It ‘s by no means certain that she is even going to be!” Roderick\nanswered.\n\n“Ah,” said Rowland, “I give it up!”\n\nRoderick almost immediately demanded that his mother should sit to him,\nat his studio, for her portrait, and Rowland ventured to add another\nword of urgency. If Roderick’s idea really held him, it was an immense\npity that his inspiration should be wasted; inspiration, in these days,\nhad become too precious a commodity. It was arranged therefore that, for\nthe present, during the mornings, Mrs. Hudson should place herself at\nher son’s service. This involved but little sacrifice, for the good\nlady’s appetite for antiquities was diminutive and bird-like, the\nusual round of galleries and churches fatigued her, and she was glad\nto purchase immunity from sight-seeing by a regular afternoon drive. It\nbecame natural in this way that, Miss Garland having her mornings\nfree, Rowland should propose to be the younger lady’s guide in whatever\nexplorations she might be disposed to make. She said she knew nothing\nabout it, but she had a great curiosity, and would be glad to see\nanything that he would show her. Rowland could not find it in his heart\nto accuse Roderick of neglect of the young girl; for it was natural that\nthe inspirations of a capricious man of genius, when they came, should\nbe imperious; but of course he wondered how Miss Garland felt, as the\nyoung man’s promised wife, on being thus expeditiously handed over to\nanother man to be entertained. However she felt, he was certain he would\nknow little about it. There had been, between them, none but indirect\nallusions to her engagement, and Rowland had no desire to discuss it\nmore largely; for he had no quarrel with matters as they stood. They\nwore the same delightful aspect through the lovely month of May, and the\nineffable charm of Rome at that period seemed but the radiant sympathy\nof nature with his happy opportunity. The weather was divine; each\nparticular morning, as he walked from his lodging to Mrs. Hudson’s\nmodest inn, seemed to have a blessing upon it. The elder lady had\nusually gone off to the studio, and he found Miss Garland sitting alone\nat the open window, turning the leaves of some book of artistic or\nantiquarian reference that he had given her. She always had a smile, she\nwas always eager, alert, responsive. She might be grave by nature, she\nmight be sad by circumstance, she might have secret doubts and pangs,\nbut she was essentially young and strong and fresh and able to enjoy.\nHer enjoyment was not especially demonstrative, but it was curiously\ndiligent. Rowland felt that it was not amusement and sensation that she\ncoveted, but knowledge--facts that she might noiselessly lay away, piece\nby piece, in the perfumed darkness of her serious mind, so that, under\nthis head at least, she should not be a perfectly portionless bride. She\nnever merely pretended to understand; she let things go, in her modest\nfashion, at the moment, but she watched them on their way, over the\ncrest of the hill, and when her fancy seemed not likely to be missed it\nwent hurrying after them and ran breathless at their side, as it were,\nand begged them for the secret. Rowland took an immense satisfaction in\nobserving that she never mistook the second-best for the best, and\nthat when she was in the presence of a masterpiece, she recognized the\noccasion as a mighty one. She said many things which he thought very\nprofound--that is, if they really had the fine intention he suspected.\nThis point he usually tried to ascertain; but he was obliged to proceed\ncautiously, for in her mistrustful shyness it seemed to her that\ncross-examination must necessarily be ironical. She wished to know just\nwhere she was going--what she would gain or lose. This was partly on\naccount of a native intellectual purity, a temper of mind that had\nnot lived with its door ajar, as one might say, upon the high-road of\nthought, for passing ideas to drop in and out at their pleasure; but had\nmade much of a few long visits from guests cherished and honored--guests\nwhose presence was a solemnity. But it was even more because she was\nconscious of a sort of growing self-respect, a sense of devoting her\nlife not to her own ends, but to those of another, whose life would be\nlarge and brilliant. She had been brought up to think a great deal of\n“nature” and nature’s innocent laws; but now Rowland had spoken to her\nardently of culture; her strenuous fancy had responded, and she was\npursuing culture into retreats where the need for some intellectual\neffort gave a noble severity to her purpose. She wished to be very sure,\nto take only the best, knowing it to be the best. There was something\nexquisite in this labor of pious self-adornment, and Rowland helped it,\nthough its fruits were not for him. In spite of her lurking rigidity\nand angularity, it was very evident that a nervous, impulsive sense\nof beauty was constantly at play in her soul, and that her actual\nexperience of beautiful things moved her in some very deep places. For\nall that she was not demonstrative, that her manner was simple, and her\nsmall-talk of no very ample flow; for all that, as she had said, she was\na young woman from the country, and the country was West Nazareth, and\nWest Nazareth was in its way a stubborn little fact, she was feeling\nthe direct influence of the great amenities of the world, and they were\nshaping her with a divinely intelligent touch. “Oh exquisite virtue of\ncircumstance!” cried Rowland to himself, “that takes us by the hand\nand leads us forth out of corners where, perforce, our attitudes are a\ntrifle contracted, and beguiles us into testing mistrusted faculties!”\n When he said to Mary Garland that he wished he might see her ten years\nhence, he was paying mentally an equal compliment to circumstance and\nto the girl herself. Capacity was there, it could be freely trusted;\nobservation would have but to sow its generous seed. “A superior\nwoman”--the idea had harsh associations, but he watched it imaging\nitself in the vagueness of the future with a kind of hopeless\nconfidence.\n\nThey went a great deal to Saint Peter’s, for which Rowland had an\nexceeding affection, a large measure of which he succeeded in infusing\ninto his companion. She confessed very speedily that to climb the long,\nlow, yellow steps, beneath the huge florid facade, and then to push\nthe ponderous leathern apron of the door, to find one’s self confronted\nwith that builded, luminous sublimity, was a sensation of which the\nkeenness renewed itself with surprising generosity. In those days the\nhospitality of the Vatican had not been curtailed, and it was an easy\nand delightful matter to pass from the gorgeous church to the solemn\ncompany of the antique marbles. Here Rowland had with his companion a\ngreat deal of talk, and found himself expounding aesthetics a perte de\nvue. He discovered that she made notes of her likes and dislikes in a\nnew-looking little memorandum book, and he wondered to what extent she\nreported his own discourse. These were charming hours. The galleries had\nbeen so cold all winter that Rowland had been an exile from them; but\nnow that the sun was already scorching in the great square between the\ncolonnades, where the twin fountains flashed almost fiercely, the marble\ncoolness of the long, image-bordered vistas made them a delightful\nrefuge. The great herd of tourists had almost departed, and our two\nfriends often found themselves, for half an hour at a time, in sole and\ntranquil possession of the beautiful Braccio Nuovo. Here and there was\nan open window, where they lingered and leaned, looking out into the\nwarm, dead air, over the towers of the city, at the soft-hued, historic\nhills, at the stately shabby gardens of the palace, or at some sunny,\nempty, grass-grown court, lost in the heart of the labyrinthine pile.\nThey went sometimes into the chambers painted by Raphael, and of course\npaid their respects to the Sistine Chapel; but Mary’s evident preference\nwas to linger among the statues. Once, when they were standing before\nthat noblest of sculptured portraits, the so-called Demosthenes, in the\nBraccio Nuovo, she made the only spontaneous allusion to her projected\nmarriage, direct or indirect, that had yet fallen from her lips. “I am\nso glad,” she said, “that Roderick is a sculptor and not a painter.”\n\nThe allusion resided chiefly in the extreme earnestness with which the\nwords were uttered. Rowland immediately asked her the reason of her\ngladness.\n\n“It ‘s not that painting is not fine,” she said, “but that sculpture is\nfiner. It is more manly.”\n\nRowland tried at times to make her talk about herself, but in this she\nhad little skill. She seemed to him so much older, so much more pliant\nto social uses than when he had seen her at home, that he had a\ndesire to draw from her some categorical account of her occupation and\nthoughts. He told her his desire and what suggested it. “It appears,\nthen,” she said, “that, after all, one can grow at home!”\n\n“Unquestionably, if one has a motive. Your growth, then, was\nunconscious? You did not watch yourself and water your roots?”\n\nShe paid no heed to his question. “I am willing to grant,” she said,\n“that Europe is more delightful than I supposed; and I don’t think that,\nmentally, I had been stingy. But you must admit that America is better\nthan you have supposed.”\n\n“I have not a fault to find with the country which produced you!”\n Rowland thought he might risk this, smiling.\n\n“And yet you want me to change--to assimilate Europe, I suppose you\nwould call it.”\n\n“I have felt that desire only on general principles. Shall I tell you\nwhat I feel now? America has made you thus far; let America finish you!\nI should like to ship you back without delay and see what becomes\nof you. That sounds unkind, and I admit there is a cold intellectual\ncuriosity in it.”\n\nShe shook her head. “The charm is broken; the thread is snapped! I\nprefer to remain here.”\n\nInvariably, when he was inclined to make of something they were talking\nof a direct application to herself, she wholly failed to assist him; she\nmade no response. Whereupon, once, with a spark of ardent irritation, he\ntold her she was very “secretive.” At this she colored a little, and\nhe said that in default of any larger confidence it would at least be\na satisfaction to make her confess to that charge. But even this\nsatisfaction she denied him, and his only revenge was in making, two\nor three times afterward, a softly ironical allusion to her slyness. He\ntold her that she was what is called in French a sournoise. “Very good,”\n she answered, almost indifferently, “and now please tell me again--I\nhave forgotten it--what you said an ‘architrave’ was.”\n\nIt was on the occasion of her asking him a question of this kind that\nhe charged her, with a humorous emphasis in which, also, if she had\nbeen curious in the matter, she might have detected a spark of restless\nardor, with having an insatiable avidity for facts. “You are always\nsnatching at information,” he said; “you will never consent to have any\ndisinterested conversation.”\n\nShe frowned a little, as she always did when he arrested their talk upon\nsomething personal. But this time she assented, and said that she knew\nshe was eager for facts. “One must make hay while the sun shines,” she\nadded. “I must lay up a store of learning against dark days. Somehow,\nmy imagination refuses to compass the idea that I may be in Rome\nindefinitely.”\n\nHe knew he had divined her real motives; but he felt that if he might\nhave said to her--what it seemed impossible to say--that fortune\npossibly had in store for her a bitter disappointment, she would have\nbeen capable of answering, immediately after the first sense of pain,\n“Say then that I am laying up resources for solitude!”\n\nBut all the accusations were not his. He had been watching, once, during\nsome brief argument, to see whether she would take her forefinger out\nof her Murray, into which she had inserted it to keep a certain page.\nIt would have been hard to say why this point interested him, for he had\nnot the slightest real apprehension that she was dry or pedantic. The\nsimple human truth was, the poor fellow was jealous of science.\nIn preaching science to her, he had over-estimated his powers of\nself-effacement. Suddenly, sinking science for the moment, she looked at\nhim very frankly and began to frown. At the same time she let the Murray\nslide down to the ground, and he was so charmed with this circumstance\nthat he made no movement to pick it up.\n\n“You are singularly inconsistent, Mr. Mallet,” she said.\n\n“How?”\n\n“That first day that we were in Saint Peter’s you said things that\ninspired me. You bade me plunge into all this. I was all ready; I only\nwanted a little push; yours was a great one; here I am in mid-ocean! And\nnow, as a reward for my bravery, you have repeatedly snubbed me.”\n\n“Distinctly, then,” said Rowland, “I strike you as inconsistent?”\n\n“That is the word.”\n\n“Then I have played my part very ill.”\n\n“Your part? What is your part supposed to have been?”\n\nHe hesitated a moment. “That of usefulness, pure and simple.”\n\n“I don’t understand you!” she said; and picking up her Murray, she\nfairly buried herself in it.\n\nThat evening he said something to her which necessarily increased her\nperplexity, though it was not uttered with such an intention. “Do you\nremember,” he asked, “my begging you, the other day, to do occasionally\nas I told you? It seemed to me you tacitly consented.”\n\n“Very tacitly.”\n\n“I have never yet really presumed on your consent. But now I would\nlike you to do this: whenever you catch me in the act of what you call\ninconsistency, ask me the meaning of some architectural term. I will\nknow what you mean; a word to the wise!”\n\nOne morning they spent among the ruins of the Palatine, that sunny\ndesolation of crumbling, over-tangled fragments, half excavated and half\nidentified, known as the Palace of the Caesars. Nothing in Rome is more\ninteresting, and no locality has such a confusion of picturesque charms.\nIt is a vast, rambling garden, where you stumble at every step on the\ndisinterred bones of the past; where damp, frescoed corridors, relics,\npossibly, of Nero’s Golden House, serve as gigantic bowers, and where,\nin the springtime, you may sit on a Latin inscription, in the shade of\na flowering almond-tree, and admire the composition of the Campagna.\nThe day left a deep impression on Rowland’s mind, partly owing to its\nintrinsic sweetness, and partly because his companion, on this occasion,\nlet her Murray lie unopened for an hour, and asked several questions\nirrelevant to the Consuls and the Caesars. She had begun by saying\nthat it was coming over her, after all, that Rome was a ponderously sad\nplace. The sirocco was gently blowing, the air was heavy, she was tired,\nshe looked a little pale.\n\n“Everything,” she said, “seems to say that all things are vanity. If one\nis doing something, I suppose one feels a certain strength within one to\ncontradict it. But if one is idle, surely it is depressing to live, year\nafter year, among the ashes of things that once were mighty. If I were\nto remain here I should either become permanently ‘low,’ as they say, or\nI would take refuge in some dogged daily work.”\n\n“What work?”\n\n“I would open a school for those beautiful little beggars; though I am\nsadly afraid I should never bring myself to scold them.”\n\n“I am idle,” said Rowland, “and yet I have kept up a certain spirit.”\n\n“I don’t call you idle,” she answered with emphasis.\n\n“It is very good of you. Do you remember our talking about that in\nNorthampton?”\n\n“During that picnic? Perfectly. Has your coming abroad succeeded, for\nyourself, as well as you hoped?”\n\n“I think I may say that it has turned out as well as I expected.”\n\n“Are you happy?”\n\n“Don’t I look so?”\n\n“So it seems to me. But”--and she hesitated a moment--“I imagine you\nlook happy whether you are so or not.”\n\n“I ‘m like that ancient comic mask that we saw just now in yonder\nexcavated fresco: I am made to grin.”\n\n“Shall you come back here next winter?”\n\n“Very probably.”\n\n“Are you settled here forever?”\n\n“‘Forever’ is a long time. I live only from year to year.”\n\n“Shall you never marry?”\n\nRowland gave a laugh. “‘Forever’--‘never!’ You handle large ideas. I\nhave not taken a vow of celibacy.”\n\n“Would n’t you like to marry?”\n\n“I should like it immensely.”\n\nTo this she made no rejoinder: but presently she asked, “Why don’t you\nwrite a book?”\n\nRowland laughed, this time more freely. “A book! What book should I\nwrite?”\n\n“A history; something about art or antiquities.”\n\n“I have neither the learning nor the talent.”\n\nShe made no attempt to contradict him; she simply said she had supposed\notherwise. “You ought, at any rate,” she continued in a moment, “to do\nsomething for yourself.”\n\n“For myself? I should have supposed that if ever a man seemed to live\nfor himself”--\n\n“I don’t know how it seems,” she interrupted, “to careless observers.\nBut we know--we know that you have lived--a great deal--for us.”\n\nHer voice trembled slightly, and she brought out the last words with a\nlittle jerk.\n\n“She has had that speech on her conscience,” thought Rowland; “she has\nbeen thinking she owed it to me, and it seemed to her that now was her\ntime to make it and have done with it.”\n\nShe went on in a way which confirmed these reflections, speaking with\ndue solemnity. “You ought to be made to know very well what we all feel.\nMrs. Hudson tells me that she has told you what she feels. Of course\nRoderick has expressed himself. I have been wanting to thank you too; I\ndo, from my heart.”\n\nRowland made no answer; his face at this moment resembled the tragic\nmask much more than the comic. But Miss Garland was not looking at him;\nshe had taken up her Murray again.\n\nIn the afternoon she usually drove with Mrs. Hudson, but Rowland\nfrequently saw her again in the evening. He was apt to spend half an\nhour in the little sitting-room at the hotel-pension on the slope of the\nPincian, and Roderick, who dined regularly with his mother, was present\non these occasions. Rowland saw him little at other times, and for\nthree weeks no observations passed between them on the subject of Mrs.\nHudson’s advent. To Rowland’s vision, as the weeks elapsed, the benefits\nto proceed from the presence of the two ladies remained shrouded in\nmystery. Roderick was peculiarly inscrutable. He was preoccupied with\nhis work on his mother’s portrait, which was taking a very happy turn;\nand often, when he sat silent, with his hands in his pockets, his legs\noutstretched, his head thrown back, and his eyes on vacancy, it was to\nbe supposed that his fancy was hovering about the half-shaped image in\nhis studio, exquisite even in its immaturity. He said little, but his\nsilence did not of necessity imply disaffection, for he evidently found\nit a deep personal luxury to lounge away the hours in an atmosphere so\ncharged with feminine tenderness. He was not alert, he suggested nothing\nin the way of excursions (Rowland was the prime mover in such as were\nattempted), but he conformed passively at least to the tranquil temper\nof the two women, and made no harsh comments nor sombre allusions.\nRowland wondered whether he had, after all, done his friend injustice in\ndenying him the sentiment of duty. He refused invitations, to Rowland’s\nknowledge, in order to dine at the jejune little table-d’hote; wherever\nhis spirit might be, he was present in the flesh with religious\nconstancy. Mrs. Hudson’s felicity betrayed itself in a remarkable\ntendency to finish her sentences and wear her best black silk gown. Her\ntremors had trembled away; she was like a child who discovers that\nthe shaggy monster it has so long been afraid to touch is an inanimate\nterror, compounded of straw and saw-dust, and that it is even a safe\naudacity to tickle its nose. As to whether the love-knot of which Mary\nGarland had the keeping still held firm, who should pronounce? The young\ngirl, as we know, did not wear it on her sleeve. She always sat at\nthe table, near the candles, with a piece of needle-work. This was the\nattitude in which Rowland had first seen her, and he thought, now that\nhe had seen her in several others, it was not the least becoming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. The Cavaliere\n\nThere befell at last a couple of days during which Rowland was unable\nto go to the hotel. Late in the evening of the second one Roderick came\ninto his room. In a few moments he announced that he had finished the\nbust of his mother.\n\n“And it ‘s magnificent!” he declared. “It ‘s one of the best things I\nhave done.”\n\n“I believe it,” said Rowland. “Never again talk to me about your\ninspiration being dead.”\n\n“Why not? This may be its last kick! I feel very tired. But it ‘s a\nmasterpiece, though I do say it. They tell us we owe so much to our\nparents. Well, I ‘ve paid the filial debt handsomely!” He walked up and\ndown the room a few moments, with the purpose of his visit evidently\nstill undischarged. “There ‘s one thing more I want to say,” he\npresently resumed. “I feel as if I ought to tell you!” He stopped before\nRowland with his head high and his brilliant glance unclouded. “Your\ninvention is a failure!”\n\n“My invention?” Rowland repeated.\n\n“Bringing out my mother and Mary.”\n\n“A failure?”\n\n“It ‘s no use! They don’t help me.”\n\nRowland had fancied that Roderick had no more surprises for him; but he\nwas now staring at him, wide-eyed.\n\n“They bore me!” Roderick went on.\n\n“Oh, oh!” cried Rowland.\n\n“Listen, listen!” said Roderick with perfect gentleness. “I am not\ncomplaining of them; I am simply stating a fact. I am very sorry for\nthem; I am greatly disappointed.”\n\n“Have you given them a fair trial?”\n\n“Should n’t you say so? It seems to me I have behaved beautifully.”\n\n“You have done very well; I have been building great hopes on it.”\n\n“I have done too well, then. After the first forty-eight hours my own\nhopes collapsed. But I determined to fight it out; to stand within the\ntemple; to let the spirit of the Lord descend! Do you want to know the\nresult? Another week of it, and I shall begin to hate them. I shall want\nto poison them.”\n\n“Miserable boy!” cried Rowland. “They are the loveliest of women!”\n\n“Very likely! But they mean no more to me than a Bible text to an\natheist!”\n\n“I utterly fail,” said Rowland, in a moment, “to understand your\nrelation to Miss Garland.”\n\nRoderick shrugged his shoulders and let his hands drop at his sides.\n“She adores me! That ‘s my relation.” And he smiled strangely.\n\n“Have you broken your engagement?”\n\n“Broken it? You can’t break a ray of moonshine.”\n\n“Have you absolutely no affection for her?”\n\nRoderick placed his hand on his heart and held it there a moment.\n“Dead--dead--dead!” he said at last.\n\n“I wonder,” Rowland asked presently, “if you begin to comprehend the\nbeauty of Miss Garland’s character. She is a person of the highest\nmerit.”\n\n“Evidently--or I would not have cared for her!”\n\n“Has that no charm for you now?”\n\n“Oh, don’t force a fellow to say rude things!”\n\n“Well, I can only say that you don’t know what you are giving up.”\n\nRoderick gave a quickened glance. “Do you know, so well?”\n\n“I admire her immeasurably.”\n\nRoderick smiled, we may almost say sympathetically. “You have not wasted\ntime.”\n\nRowland’s thoughts were crowding upon him fast. If Roderick was\nresolute, why oppose him? If Mary was to be sacrificed, why, in that\nway, try to save her? There was another way; it only needed a little\npresumption to make it possible. Rowland tried, mentally, to summon\npresumption to his aid; but whether it came or not, it found conscience\nthere before it. Conscience had only three words, but they were cogent.\n“For her sake--for her sake,” it dumbly murmured, and Rowland resumed\nhis argument. “I don’t know what I would n’t do,” he said, “rather than\nthat Miss Garland should suffer.”\n\n“There is one thing to be said,” Roderick answered reflectively. “She is\nvery strong.”\n\n“Well, then, if she ‘s strong, believe that with a longer chance, a\nbetter chance, she will still regain your affection.”\n\n“Do you know what you ask?” cried Roderick. “Make love to a girl I\nhate?”\n\n“You hate?”\n\n“As her lover, I should hate her!”\n\n“Listen to me!” said Rowland with vehemence.\n\n“No, listen you to me! Do you really urge my marrying a woman who would\nbore me to death? I would let her know it in very good season, and then\nwhere would she be?”\n\nRowland walked the length of the room a couple of times and then stopped\nsuddenly. “Go your way, then! Say all this to her, not to me!”\n\n“To her? I am afraid of her; I want you to help me.”\n\n“My dear Roderick,” said Rowland with an eloquent smile, “I can help you\nno more!”\n\nRoderick frowned, hesitated a moment, and then took his hat. “Oh, well,”\n he said, “I am not so afraid of her as all that!” And he turned, as if\nto depart.\n\n“Stop!” cried Rowland, as he laid his hand on the door.\n\nRoderick paused and stood waiting, with his irritated brow.\n\n“Come back; sit down there and listen to me. Of anything you were to say\nin your present state of mind you would live most bitterly to repent.\nYou don’t know what you really think; you don’t know what you really\nfeel. You don’t know your own mind; you don’t do justice to Miss\nGarland. All this is impossible here, under these circumstances. You ‘re\nblind, you ‘re deaf, you ‘re under a spell. To break it, you must leave\nRome.”\n\n“Leave Rome! Rome was never so dear to me.”\n\n“That ‘s not of the smallest consequence. Leave it instantly.”\n\n“And where shall I go?”\n\n“Go to some place where you may be alone with your mother and Miss\nGarland.”\n\n“Alone? You will not come?”\n\n“Oh, if you desire it, I will come.”\n\nRoderick inclining his head a little, looked at his friend askance. “I\ndon’t understand you,” he said; “I wish you liked Miss Garland either a\nlittle less, or a little more.”\n\nRowland felt himself coloring, but he paid no heed to Roderick’s speech.\n“You ask me to help you,” he went on. “On these present conditions I can\ndo nothing. But if you will postpone all decision as to the continuance\nof your engagement a couple of months longer, and meanwhile leave Rome,\nleave Italy, I will do what I can to ‘help you,’ as you say, in the\nevent of your still wishing to break it.”\n\n“I must do without your help then! Your conditions are impossible. I\nwill leave Rome at the time I have always intended--at the end of June.\nMy rooms and my mother’s are taken till then; all my arrangements are\nmade accordingly. Then, I will depart; not before.”\n\n“You are not frank,” said Rowland. “Your real reason for staying has\nnothing to do with your rooms.”\n\nRoderick’s face betrayed neither embarrassment nor resentment. “If I ‘m\nnot frank, it ‘s for the first time in my life. Since you know so much\nabout my real reason, let me hear it! No, stop!” he suddenly added, “I\nwon’t trouble you. You are right, I have a motive. On the twenty-fourth\nof June Miss Light is to be married. I take an immense interest in all\nthat concerns her, and I wish to be present at her wedding.”\n\n“But you said the other day at Saint Peter’s that it was by no means\ncertain her marriage would take place.”\n\n“Apparently I was wrong: the invitations, I am told, are going out.”\n\nRowland felt that it would be utterly vain to remonstrate, and that the\nonly thing for him was to make the best terms possible. “If I offer no\nfurther opposition to your waiting for Miss Light’s marriage,” he said,\n“will you promise, meanwhile and afterwards, for a certain period, to\ndefer to my judgment--to say nothing that may be a cause of suffering to\nMiss Garland?”\n\n“For a certain period? What period?” Roderick demanded.\n\n“Ah, don’t drive so close a bargain! Don’t you understand that I have\ntaken you away from her, that I suffer in every nerve in consequence,\nand that I must do what I can to restore you?”\n\n“Do what you can, then,” said Roderick gravely, putting out his hand.\n“Do what you can!” His tone and his hand-shake seemed to constitute a\npromise, and upon this they parted.\n\nRoderick’s bust of his mother, whether or no it was a discharge of what\nhe called the filial debt, was at least a most admirable production.\nRowland, at the time it was finished, met Gloriani one evening, and this\nunscrupulous genius immediately began to ask questions about it. “I am\ntold our high-flying friend has come down,” he said. “He has been doing\na queer little old woman.”\n\n“A queer little old woman!” Rowland exclaimed. “My dear sir, she is\nHudson’s mother.”\n\n“All the more reason for her being queer! It is a bust for terra-cotta,\neh?”\n\n“By no means; it is for marble.”\n\n“That ‘s a pity. It was described to me as a charming piece of\nquaintness: a little demure, thin-lipped old lady, with her head on\none side, and the prettiest wrinkles in the world--a sort of fairy\ngodmother.”\n\n“Go and see it, and judge for yourself,” said Rowland.\n\n“No, I see I shall be disappointed. It ‘s quite the other thing, the\nsort of thing they put into the campo-santos. I wish that boy would\nlisten to me an hour!”\n\nBut a day or two later Rowland met him again in the street, and, as\nthey were near, proposed they should adjourn to Roderick’s studio.\nHe consented, and on entering they found the young master. Roderick’s\ndemeanor to Gloriani was never conciliatory, and on this occasion\nsupreme indifference was apparently all he had to offer. But Gloriani,\nlike a genuine connoisseur, cared nothing for his manners; he cared only\nfor his skill. In the bust of Mrs. Hudson there was something almost\ntouching; it was an exquisite example of a ruling sense of beauty. The\npoor lady’s small, neat, timorous face had certainly no great character,\nbut Roderick had reproduced its sweetness, its mildness, its minuteness,\nits still maternal passion, with the most unerring art. It was perfectly\nunflattered, and yet admirably tender; it was the poetry of fidelity.\nGloriani stood looking at it a long time most intently. Roderick\nwandered away into the neighboring room.\n\n“I give it up!” said the sculptor at last. “I don’t understand it.”\n\n“But you like it?” said Rowland.\n\n“Like it? It ‘s a pearl of pearls. Tell me this,” he added: “is he very\nfond of his mother; is he a very good son?” And he gave Rowland a sharp\nlook.\n\n“Why, she adores him,” said Rowland, smiling.\n\n“That ‘s not an answer! But it ‘s none of my business. Only if I, in his\nplace, being suspected of having--what shall I call it?--a cold heart,\nmanaged to do that piece of work, oh, oh! I should be called a pretty\nlot of names. Charlatan, poseur, arrangeur! But he can do as he chooses!\nMy dear young man, I know you don’t like me,” he went on, as Roderick\ncame back. “It ‘s a pity; you are strong enough not to care about me at\nall. You are very strong.”\n\n“Not at all,” said Roderick curtly. “I am very weak!”\n\n“I told you last year that you would n’t keep it up. I was a great ass.\nYou will!”\n\n“I beg your pardon--I won’t!” retorted Roderick.\n\n“Though I ‘m a great ass, all the same, eh? Well, call me what you will,\nso long as you turn out this sort of thing! I don’t suppose it makes any\nparticular difference, but I should like to say now I believe in you.”\n\nRoderick stood looking at him for a moment with a strange hardness in\nhis face. It flushed slowly, and two glittering, angry tears filled his\neyes. It was the first time Rowland had ever seen them there; he saw\nthem but once again. Poor Gloriani, he was sure, had never in his life\nspoken with less of irony; but to Roderick there was evidently a sense\nof mockery in his profession of faith. He turned away with a muttered,\npassionate imprecation. Gloriani was accustomed to deal with complex\nproblems, but this time he was hopelessly puzzled. “What ‘s the matter\nwith him?” he asked, simply.\n\nRowland gave a sad smile, and touched his forehead. “Genius, I suppose.”\n\nGloriani sent another parting, lingering look at the bust of Mrs.\nHudson. “Well, it ‘s deuced perfect, it ‘s deuced simple; I do believe\nin him!” he said. “But I ‘m glad I ‘m not a genius. It makes,” he added\nwith a laugh, as he looked for Roderick to wave him good-by, and saw his\nback still turned, “it makes a more sociable studio.”\n\nRowland had purchased, as he supposed, temporary tranquillity for Mary\nGarland; but his own humor in these days was not especially peaceful. He\nwas attempting, in a certain sense, to lead the ideal life, and he found\nit, at the least, not easy. The days passed, but brought with them no\nofficial invitation to Miss Light’s wedding. He occasionally met her,\nand he occasionally met Prince Casamassima; but always separately,\nnever together. They were apparently taking their happiness in the\ninexpressive manner proper to people of social eminence. Rowland\ncontinued to see Madame Grandoni, for whom he felt a confirmed\naffection. He had always talked to her with frankness, but now he made\nher a confidant of all his hidden dejection. Roderick and Roderick’s\nconcerns had been a common theme with him, and it was in the natural\ncourse to talk of Mrs. Hudson’s arrival and Miss Garland’s fine smile.\nMadame Grandoni was an intelligent listener, and she lost no time in\nputting his case for him in a nutshell. “At one moment you tell me the\ngirl is plain,” she said; “the next you tell me she ‘s pretty. I will\ninvite them, and I shall see for myself. But one thing is very clear:\nyou are in love with her.”\n\nRowland, for all answer, glanced round to see that no one heard her.\n\n“More than that,” she added, “you have been in love with her these two\nyears. There was that certain something about you!... I knew you were a\nmild, sweet fellow, but you had a touch of it more than was natural.\nWhy did n’t you tell me at once? You would have saved me a great deal of\ntrouble. And poor Augusta Blanchard too!” And herewith Madame Grandoni\ncommunicated a pertinent fact: Augusta Blanchard and Mr. Leavenworth\nwere going to make a match. The young lady had been staying for a month\nat Albano, and Mr. Leavenworth had been dancing attendance. The event\nwas a matter of course. Rowland, who had been lately reproaching himself\nwith a failure of attention to Miss Blanchard’s doings, made some such\nobservation.\n\n“But you did not find it so!” cried his hostess. “It was a matter of\ncourse, perhaps, that Mr. Leavenworth, who seems to be going about\nEurope with the sole view of picking up furniture for his ‘home,’ as he\ncalls it, should think Miss Blanchard a very handsome piece; but it was\nnot a matter of course--or it need n’t have been--that she should be\nwilling to become a sort of superior table-ornament. She would have\naccepted you if you had tried.”\n\n“You are supposing the insupposable,” said Rowland. “She never gave me a\nparticle of encouragement.”\n\n“What would you have had her do? The poor girl did her best, and I am\nsure that when she accepted Mr. Leavenworth she thought of you.”\n\n“She thought of the pleasure her marriage would give me.”\n\n“Ay, pleasure indeed! She is a thoroughly good girl, but she has her\nlittle grain of feminine spite, like the rest. Well, he ‘s richer than\nyou, and she will have what she wants; but before I forgive you I must\nwait and see this new arrival--what do you call her?--Miss Garland. If\nI like her, I will forgive you; if I don’t, I shall always bear you a\ngrudge.”\n\nRowland answered that he was sorry to forfeit any advantage she might\noffer him, but that his exculpatory passion for Miss Garland was a\nfigment of her fancy. Miss Garland was engaged to another man, and he\nhimself had no claims.\n\n“Well, then,” said Madame Grandoni, “if I like her, we ‘ll have it that\nyou ought to be in love with her. If you fail in this, it will be a\ndouble misdemeanor. The man she ‘s engaged to does n’t care a straw for\nher. Leave me alone and I ‘ll tell her what I think of you.”\n\nAs to Christina Light’s marriage, Madame Grandoni could make no definite\nstatement. The young girl, of late, had made her several flying\nvisits, in the intervals of the usual pre-matrimonial shopping and\ndress-fitting; she had spoken of the event with a toss of her head, as a\nmatter which, with a wise old friend who viewed things in their\nessence, she need not pretend to treat as a solemnity. It was for Prince\nCasamassima to do that. “It is what they call a marriage of reason,” she\nonce said. “That means, you know, a marriage of madness!”\n\n“What have you said in the way of advice?” Rowland asked.\n\n“Very little, but that little has favored the prince. I know nothing of\nthe mysteries of the young lady’s heart. It may be a gold-mine, but at\nany rate it ‘s a mine, and it ‘s a long journey down into it. But the\nmarriage in itself is an excellent marriage. It ‘s not only brilliant,\nbut it ‘s safe. I think Christina is quite capable of making it a\nmeans of misery; but there is no position that would be sacred to her.\nCasamassima is an irreproachable young man; there is nothing against\nhim but that he is a prince. It is not often, I fancy, that a prince has\nbeen put through his paces at this rate. No one knows the wedding-day;\nthe cards of invitation have been printed half a dozen times over, with\na different date; each time Christina has destroyed them. There are\npeople in Rome who are furious at the delay; they want to get away; they\nare in a dreadful fright about the fever, but they are dying to see the\nwedding, and if the day were fixed, they would make their arrangements\nto wait for it. I think it very possible that after having kept them a\nmonth and produced a dozen cases of malaria, Christina will be married\nat midnight by an old friar, with simply the legal witnesses.”\n\n“It is true, then, that she has become a Catholic?”\n\n“So she tells me. One day she got up in the depths of despair; at her\nwit’s end, I suppose, in other words, for a new sensation. Suddenly it\noccurred to her that the Catholic church might after all hold the key,\nmight give her what she wanted! She sent for a priest; he happened to be\na clever man, and he contrived to interest her. She put on a black dress\nand a black lace veil, and looking handsomer than ever she rustled into\nthe Catholic church. The prince, who is very devout, and who had her\nheresy sorely on his conscience, was thrown into an ecstasy. May she\nnever have a caprice that pleases him less!”\n\nRowland had already asked Madame Grandoni what, to her perception, was\nthe present state of matters between Christina and Roderick; and he now\nrepeated his question with some earnestness of apprehension. “The girl\nis so deucedly dramatic,” he said, “that I don’t know what coup de\ntheatre she may have in store for us. Such a stroke was her turning\nCatholic; such a stroke would be her some day making her courtesy to a\ndisappointed world as Princess Casamassima, married at midnight, in her\nbonnet. She might do--she may do--something that would make even more\nstarers! I ‘m prepared for anything.”\n\n“You mean that she might elope with your sculptor, eh?”\n\n“I ‘m prepared for anything!”\n\n“Do you mean that he ‘s ready?”\n\n“Do you think that she is?”\n\n“They ‘re a precious pair! I think this. You by no means exhaust the\nsubject when you say that Christina is dramatic. It ‘s my belief that in\nthe course of her life she will do a certain number of things from pure\ndisinterested passion. She ‘s immeasurably proud, and if that is often\na fault in a virtuous person, it may be a merit in a vicious one. She\nneeds to think well of herself; she knows a fine character, easily,\nwhen she meets one; she hates to suffer by comparison, even though the\ncomparison is made by herself alone; and when the estimate she may\nhave made of herself grows vague, she needs to do something to give\nit definite, impressive form. What she will do in such a case will be\nbetter or worse, according to her opportunity; but I imagine it will\ngenerally be something that will drive her mother to despair; something\nof the sort usually termed ‘unworldly.’”\n\nRowland, as he was taking his leave, after some further exchange of\nopinions, rendered Miss Light the tribute of a deeply meditative sigh.\n“She has bothered me half to death,” he said, “but somehow I can’t\nmanage, as I ought, to hate her. I admire her, half the time, and a good\npart of the rest I pity her.”\n\n“I think I most pity her!” said Madame Grandoni.\n\nThis enlightened woman came the next day to call upon the two ladies\nfrom Northampton. She carried their shy affections by storm, and made\nthem promise to drink tea with her on the evening of the morrow. Her\nvisit was an era in the life of poor Mrs. Hudson, who did nothing but\nmake sudden desultory allusions to her, for the next thirty-six hours.\n“To think of her being a foreigner!” she would exclaim, after much\nintent reflection, over her knitting; “she speaks so beautifully!”\n Then in a little while, “She was n’t so much dressed as you might have\nexpected. Did you notice how easy it was in the waist? I wonder if that\n‘s the fashion?” Or, “She ‘s very old to wear a hat; I should never dare\nto wear a hat!” Or, “Did you notice her hands?--very pretty hands for\nsuch a stout person. A great many rings, but nothing very handsome. I\nsuppose they are hereditary.” Or, “She ‘s certainly not handsome, but\nshe ‘s very sweet-looking. I wonder why she does n’t have something\ndone to her teeth.” Rowland also received a summons to Madame Grandoni’s\ntea-drinking, and went betimes, as he had been requested. He was eagerly\ndesirous to lend his mute applause to Mary Garland’s debut in the Roman\nsocial world. The two ladies had arrived, with Roderick, silent and\ncareless, in attendance. Miss Blanchard was also present, escorted by\nMr. Leavenworth, and the party was completed by a dozen artists of both\nsexes and various nationalities. It was a friendly and easy assembly,\nlike all Madame Grandoni’s parties, and in the course of the evening\nthere was some excellent music. People played and sang for Madame\nGrandoni, on easy terms, who, elsewhere, were not to be heard for the\nasking. She was herself a superior musician, and singers found it a\nprivilege to perform to her accompaniment. Rowland talked to various\npersons, but for the first time in his life his attention visibly\nwandered; he could not keep his eyes off Mary Garland. Madame Grandoni\nhad said that he sometimes spoke of her as pretty and sometimes as\nplain; to-night, if he had had occasion to describe her appearance, he\nwould have called her beautiful. She was dressed more than he had ever\nseen her; it was becoming, and gave her a deeper color and an ampler\npresence. Two or three persons were introduced to her who were\napparently witty people, for she sat listening to them with her\nbrilliant natural smile. Rowland, from an opposite corner, reflected\nthat he had never varied in his appreciation of Miss Blanchard’s classic\ncontour, but that somehow, to-night, it impressed him hardly more\nthan an effigy stamped upon a coin of low value. Roderick could not be\naccused of rancor, for he had approached Mr. Leavenworth with unstudied\nfamiliarity, and, lounging against the wall, with hands in pockets, was\ndiscoursing to him with candid serenity. Now that he had done him an\nimpertinence, he evidently found him less intolerable. Mr. Leavenworth\nstood stirring his tea and silently opening and shutting his mouth,\nwithout looking at the young sculptor, like a large, drowsy dog snapping\nat flies. Rowland had found it disagreeable to be told Miss Blanchard\nwould have married him for the asking, and he would have felt some\nembarrassment in going to speak to her if his modesty had not found\nincredulity so easy. The facile side of a union with Miss Blanchard had\nnever been present to his mind; it had struck him as a thing, in all\nways, to be compassed with a great effort. He had half an hour’s talk\nwith her; a farewell talk, as it seemed to him--a farewell not to a real\nillusion, but to the idea that for him, in that matter, there could ever\nbe an acceptable pis-aller. He congratulated Miss Blanchard upon her\nengagement, and she received his compliment with a touch of primness.\nBut she was always a trifle prim, even when she was quoting Mrs.\nBrowning and George Sand, and this harmless defect did not prevent her\nresponding on this occasion that Mr. Leavenworth had a “glorious heart.”\n Rowland wished to manifest an extreme regard, but toward the end of the\ntalk his zeal relaxed, and he fell a-thinking that a certain natural\nease in a woman was the most delightful thing in the world. There was\nChristina Light, who had too much, and here was Miss Blanchard, who had\ntoo little, and there was Mary Garland (in whom the quality was wholly\nuncultivated), who had just the right amount.\n\nHe went to Madame Grandoni in an adjoining room, where she was pouring\nout tea.\n\n“I will make you an excellent cup,” she said, “because I have forgiven\nyou.”\n\nHe looked at her, answering nothing; but he swallowed his tea with great\ngusto, and a slight deepening of his color; by all of which one would\nhave known that he was gratified. In a moment he intimated that, in so\nfar as he had sinned, he had forgiven himself.\n\n“She is a lovely girl,” said Madame Grandoni. “There is a great deal\nthere. I have taken a great fancy to her, and she must let me make a\nfriend of her.”\n\n“She is very plain,” said Rowland, slowly, “very simple, very ignorant.”\n\n“Which, being interpreted, means, ‘She is very handsome, very subtle,\nand has read hundreds of volumes on winter evenings in the country.’”\n\n“You are a veritable sorceress,” cried Rowland; “you frighten me away!”\n As he was turning to leave her, there rose above the hum of voices in\nthe drawing-room the sharp, grotesque note of a barking dog. Their eyes\nmet in a glance of intelligence.\n\n“There is the sorceress!” said Madame Grandoni. “The sorceress and her\nnecromantic poodle!” And she hastened back to the post of hospitality.\n\nRowland followed her, and found Christina Light standing in the middle\nof the drawing-room, and looking about in perplexity. Her poodle,\nsitting on his haunches and gazing at the company, had apparently been\nexpressing a sympathetic displeasure at the absence of a welcome. But\nin a moment Madame Grandoni had come to the young girl’s relief, and\nChristina had tenderly kissed her.\n\n“I had no idea,” said Christina, surveying the assembly, “that you had\nsuch a lot of grand people, or I would not have come in. The servant\nsaid nothing; he took me for an invitee. I came to spend a neighborly\nhalf-hour; you know I have n’t many left! It was too dismally dreary at\nhome. I hoped I should find you alone, and I brought Stenterello to play\nwith the cat. I don’t know that if I had known about all this I would\nhave dared to come in; but since I ‘ve stumbled into the midst of it, I\nbeg you ‘ll let me stay. I am not dressed, but am I very hideous? I will\nsit in a corner and no one will notice me. My dear, sweet lady, do let\nme stay. Pray, why did n’t you ask me? I never have been to a little\nparty like this. They must be very charming. No dancing--tea and\nconversation? No tea, thank you; but if you could spare a biscuit for\nStenterello; a sweet biscuit, please. Really, why did n’t you ask me?\nDo you have these things often? Madame Grandoni, it ‘s very unkind!” And\nthe young girl, who had delivered herself of the foregoing succession of\nsentences in her usual low, cool, penetrating voice, uttered these last\nwords with a certain tremor of feeling. “I see,” she went on, “I do very\nwell for balls and great banquets, but when people wish to have a\ncosy, friendly, comfortable evening, they leave me out, with the big\nflower-pots and the gilt candlesticks.”\n\n“I ‘m sure you ‘re welcome to stay, my dear,” said Madame Grandoni, “and\nat the risk of displeasing you I must confess that if I did n’t invite\nyou, it was because you ‘re too grand. Your dress will do very well,\nwith its fifty flounces, and there is no need of your going into a\ncorner. Indeed, since you ‘re here, I propose to have the glory of it.\nYou must remain where my people can see you.”\n\n“They are evidently determined to do that by the way they stare. Do they\nthink I intend to dance a tarantella? Who are they all; do I know them?”\n And lingering in the middle of the room, with her arm passed into Madame\nGrandoni’s, she let her eyes wander slowly from group to group.\nThey were of course observing her. Standing in the little circle\nof lamplight, with the hood of an Eastern burnous, shot with silver\nthreads, falling back from her beautiful head, one hand gathering\ntogether its voluminous, shimmering folds, and the other playing with\nthe silken top-knot on the uplifted head of her poodle, she was a figure\nof radiant picturesqueness. She seemed to be a sort of extemporized\ntableau vivant. Rowland’s position made it becoming for him to speak\nto her without delay. As she looked at him he saw that, judging by the\nlight of her beautiful eyes, she was in a humor of which she had not yet\ntreated him to a specimen. In a simpler person he would have called it\nexquisite kindness; but in this young lady’s deportment the flower was\none thing and the perfume another. “Tell me about these people,” she\nsaid to him. “I had no idea there were so many people in Rome I had not\nseen. What are they all talking about? It ‘s all beyond me, I suppose.\nThere is Miss Blanchard, sitting as usual in profile against a dark\nobject. She is like a head on a postage-stamp. And there is that nice\nlittle old lady in black, Mrs. Hudson. What a dear little woman for a\nmother! Comme elle est proprette! And the other, the fiancee, of course\nshe ‘s here. Ah, I see!” She paused; she was looking intently at Miss\nGarland. Rowland measured the intentness of her glance, and suddenly\nacquired a firm conviction. “I should like so much to know her!” she\nsaid, turning to Madame Grandoni. “She has a charming face; I am sure\nshe ‘s an angel. I wish very much you would introduce me. No, on second\nthoughts, I had rather you did n’t. I will speak to her bravely myself,\nas a friend of her cousin.” Madame Grandoni and Rowland exchanged\nglances of baffled conjecture, and Christina flung off her burnous,\ncrumpled it together, and, with uplifted finger, tossing it into a\ncorner, gave it in charge to her poodle. He stationed himself upon it,\non his haunches, with upright vigilance. Christina crossed the room with\nthe step and smile of a ministering angel, and introduced herself to\nMary Garland. She had once told Rowland that she would show him, some\nday, how gracious her manners could be; she was now redeeming her\npromise. Rowland, watching her, saw Mary Garland rise slowly, in\nresponse to her greeting, and look at her with serious deep-gazing eyes.\nThe almost dramatic opposition of these two keenly interesting girls\ntouched Rowland with a nameless apprehension, and after a moment he\npreferred to turn away. In doing so he noticed Roderick. The young\nsculptor was standing planted on the train of a lady’s dress, gazing\nacross at Christina’s movements with undisguised earnestness. There were\nseveral more pieces of music; Rowland sat in a corner and listened to\nthem. When they were over, several people began to take their leave,\nMrs. Hudson among the number. Rowland saw her come up to Madame\nGrandoni, clinging shyly to Mary Garland’s arm. Miss Garland had a\nbrilliant eye and a deep color in her cheek. The two ladies looked\nabout for Roderick, but Roderick had his back turned. He had approached\nChristina, who, with an absent air, was sitting alone, where she had\ntaken her place near Miss Garland, looking at the guests pass out of the\nroom. Christina’s eye, like Miss Garland’s, was bright, but her cheek\nwas pale. Hearing Roderick’s voice, she looked up at him sharply; then\nsilently, with a single quick gesture, motioned him away. He obeyed her,\nand came and joined his mother in bidding good night to Madame Grandoni.\nChristina, in a moment, met Rowland’s glance, and immediately beckoned\nhim to come to her. He was familiar with her spontaneity of movement,\nand was scarcely surprised. She made a place for him on the sofa beside\nher; he wondered what was coming now. He was not sure it was not a mere\nfancy, but it seemed to him that he had never seen her look just as\nshe was looking then. It was a humble, touching, appealing look, and it\nthrew into wonderful relief the nobleness of her beauty. “How many more\nmetamorphoses,” he asked himself, “am I to be treated to before we have\ndone?”\n\n“I want to tell you,” said Christina. “I have taken an immense fancy to\nMiss Garland. Are n’t you glad?”\n\n“Delighted!” exclaimed poor Rowland.\n\n“Ah, you don’t believe it,” she said with soft dignity.\n\n“Is it so hard to believe?”\n\n“Not that people in general should admire her, but that I should. But I\nwant to tell you; I want to tell some one, and I can’t tell Miss Garland\nherself. She thinks me already a horrid false creature, and if I were to\nexpress to her frankly what I think of her, I should simply disgust her.\nShe would be quite right; she has repose, and from that point of view I\nand my doings must seem monstrous. Unfortunately, I have n’t repose. I\nam trembling now; if I could ask you to feel my arm, you would see!\nBut I want to tell you that I admire Miss Garland more than any of the\npeople who call themselves her friends--except of course you. Oh, I know\nthat! To begin with, she is extremely handsome, and she does n’t know\nit.”\n\n“She is not generally thought handsome,” said Rowland.\n\n“Evidently! That ‘s the vulgarity of the human mind. Her head has great\ncharacter, great natural style. If a woman is not to be a supreme beauty\nin the regular way, she will choose, if she ‘s wise, to look like that.\nShe ‘ll not be thought pretty by people in general, and desecrated, as\nshe passes, by the stare of every vile wretch who chooses to thrust his\nnose under her bonnet; but a certain number of superior people will find\nit one of the delightful things of life to look at her. That lot is as\ngood as another! Then she has a beautiful character!”\n\n“You found that out soon!” said Rowland, smiling.\n\n“How long did it take you? I found it out before I ever spoke to her.\nI met her the other day in Saint Peter’s; I knew it then. I knew it--do\nyou want to know how long I have known it?”\n\n“Really,” said Rowland, “I did n’t mean to cross-examine you.”\n\n“Do you remember mamma’s ball in December? We had some talk and you\nthen mentioned her--not by name. You said but three words, but I saw\nyou admired her, and I knew that if you admired her she must have a\nbeautiful character. That ‘s what you require!”\n\n“Upon my word,” cried Rowland, “you make three words go very far!”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Hudson has also spoken of her.”\n\n“Ah, that ‘s better!” said Rowland.\n\n“I don’t know; he does n’t like her.”\n\n“Did he tell you so?” The question left Rowland’s lips before he could\nstay it, which he would have done on a moment’s reflection.\n\nChristina looked at him intently. “No!” she said at last. “That would\nhave been dishonorable, would n’t it? But I know it from my knowledge of\nhim. He does n’t like perfection; he is not bent upon being safe, in\nhis likings; he ‘s willing to risk something! Poor fellow, he risks too\nmuch!”\n\nRowland was silent; he did not care for the thrust; but he was\nprofoundly mystified. Christina beckoned to her poodle, and the\ndog marched stiffly across to her. She gave a loving twist to his\nrose-colored top-knot, and bade him go and fetch her burnous. He obeyed,\ngathered it up in his teeth, and returned with great solemnity, dragging\nit along the floor.\n\n“I do her justice. I do her full justice,” she went on, with soft\nearnestness. “I like to say that, I like to be able to say it. She ‘s\nfull of intelligence and courage and devotion. She does n’t do me a\ngrain of justice; but that is no harm. There is something so fine in the\naversions of a good woman!”\n\n“If you would give Miss Garland a chance,” said Rowland, “I am sure she\nwould be glad to be your friend.”\n\n“What do you mean by a chance? She has only to take it. I told her\nI liked her immensely, and she frowned as if I had said something\ndisgusting. She looks very handsome when she frowns.” Christina rose,\nwith these words, and began to gather her mantle about her. “I don’t\noften like women,” she went on. “In fact I generally detest them. But\nI should like to know Miss Garland well. I should like to have a\nfriendship with her; I have never had one; they must be very delightful.\nBut I shan’t have one now, either--not if she can help it! Ask her what\nshe thinks of me; see what she will say. I don’t want to know; keep it\nto yourself. It ‘s too sad. So we go through life. It ‘s fatality--that\n‘s what they call it, is n’t it? We please the people we don’t care for,\nwe displease those we do! But I appreciate her, I do her justice; that\n‘s the more important thing. It ‘s because I have imagination. She has\nnone. Never mind; it ‘s her only fault. I do her justice; I understand\nvery well.” She kept softly murmuring and looking about for Madame\nGrandoni. She saw the good lady near the door, and put out her hand to\nRowland for good night. She held his hand an instant, fixing him with\nher eyes, the living splendor of which, at this moment, was something\ntranscendent. “Yes, I do her justice,” she repeated. “And you do her\nmore; you would lay down your life for her.” With this she turned away,\nand before he could answer, she left him. She went to Madame Grandoni,\ngrasped her two hands, and held out her forehead to be kissed. The next\nmoment she was gone.\n\n“That was a happy accident!” said Madame Grandoni. “She never looked so\nbeautiful, and she made my little party brilliant.”\n\n“Beautiful, verily!” Rowland answered. “But it was no accident.”\n\n“What was it, then?”\n\n“It was a plan. She wished to see Miss Garland. She knew she was to be\nhere.”\n\n“How so?”\n\n“By Roderick, evidently.”\n\n“And why did she wish to see Miss Garland?”\n\n“Heaven knows! I give it up!”\n\n“Ah, the wicked girl!” murmured Madame Grandoni.\n\n“No,” said Rowland; “don’t say that now. She ‘s too beautiful.”\n\n“Oh, you men! The best of you!”\n\n“Well, then,” cried Rowland, “she ‘s too good!”\n\nThe opportunity presenting itself the next day, he failed not, as you\nmay imagine, to ask Mary Garland what she thought of Miss Light. It was\na Saturday afternoon, the time at which the beautiful marbles of the\nVilla Borghese are thrown open to the public. Mary had told him that\nRoderick had promised to take her to see them, with his mother, and he\njoined the party in the splendid Casino. The warm weather had left so\nfew strangers in Rome that they had the place almost to themselves. Mrs.\nHudson had confessed to an invincible fear of treading, even with the\nhelp of her son’s arm, the polished marble floors, and was sitting\npatiently on a stool, with folded hands, looking shyly, here and there,\nat the undraped paganism around her. Roderick had sauntered off alone,\nwith an irritated brow, which seemed to betray the conflict between\nthe instinct of observation and the perplexities of circumstance.\nMiss Garland was wandering in another direction, and though she was\nconsulting her catalogue, Rowland fancied it was from habit; she too\nwas preoccupied. He joined her, and she presently sat down on a divan,\nrather wearily, and closed her Murray. Then he asked her abruptly how\nChristina had pleased her.\n\nShe started the least bit at the question, and he felt that she had been\nthinking of Christina.\n\n“I don’t like her!” she said with decision.\n\n“What do you think of her?”\n\n“I think she ‘s false.” This was said without petulance or bitterness,\nbut with a very positive air.\n\n“But she wished to please you; she tried,” Rowland rejoined, in a\nmoment.\n\n“I think not. She wished to please herself!”\n\nRowland felt himself at liberty to say no more. No allusion to Christina\nhad passed between them since the day they met her at Saint Peter’s,\nbut he knew that she knew, by that infallible sixth sense of a woman who\nloves, that this strange, beautiful girl had the power to injure her.\nTo what extent she had the will, Mary was uncertain; but last night’s\ninterview, apparently, had not reassured her. It was, under these\ncircumstances, equally unbecoming for Rowland either to depreciate or\nto defend Christina, and he had to content himself with simply having\nverified the girl’s own assurance that she had made a bad impression.\nHe tried to talk of indifferent matters--about the statues and the\nfrescoes; but to-day, plainly, aesthetic curiosity, with Miss Garland,\nhad folded its wings. Curiosity of another sort had taken its place.\nMary was longing, he was sure, to question him about Christina; but she\nfound a dozen reasons for hesitating. Her questions would imply that\nRoderick had not treated her with confidence, for information on this\npoint should properly have come from him. They would imply that she was\njealous, and to betray her jealousy was intolerable to her pride. For\nsome minutes, as she sat scratching the brilliant pavement with the\npoint of her umbrella, it was to be supposed that her pride and her\nanxiety held an earnest debate. At last anxiety won.\n\n“A propos of Miss Light,” she asked, “do you know her well?”\n\n“I can hardly say that. But I have seen her repeatedly.”\n\n“Do you like her?”\n\n“Yes and no. I think I am sorry for her.”\n\nMary had spoken with her eyes on the pavement. At this she looked up.\n“Sorry for her? Why?”\n\n“Well--she is unhappy.”\n\n“What are her misfortunes?”\n\n“Well--she has a horrible mother, and she has had a most injurious\neducation.”\n\nFor a moment Miss Garland was silent. Then, “Is n’t she very beautiful?”\n she asked.\n\n“Don’t you think so?”\n\n“That ‘s measured by what men think! She is extremely clever, too.”\n\n“Oh, incontestably.”\n\n“She has beautiful dresses.”\n\n“Yes, any number of them.”\n\n“And beautiful manners.”\n\n“Yes--sometimes.”\n\n“And plenty of money.”\n\n“Money enough, apparently.”\n\n“And she receives great admiration.”\n\n“Very true.”\n\n“And she is to marry a prince.”\n\n“So they say.”\n\nMiss Garland rose and turned to rejoin her companions, commenting these\nadmissions with a pregnant silence. “Poor Miss Light!” she said at\nlast, simply. And in this it seemed to Rowland there was a touch of\nbitterness.\n\nVery late on the following evening his servant brought him the card of a\nvisitor. He was surprised at a visit at such an hour, but it may be\nsaid that when he read the inscription--Cavaliere Giuseppe Giacosa--his\nsurprise declined. He had had an unformulated conviction that there was\nto be a sequel to the apparition at Madame Grandoni’s; the Cavaliere had\ncome to usher it in.\n\nHe had come, evidently, on a portentous errand. He was as pale as ashes\nand prodigiously serious; his little cold black eye had grown ardent,\nand he had left his caressing smile at home. He saluted Rowland,\nhowever, with his usual obsequious bow.\n\n“You have more than once done me the honor to invite me to call upon\nyou,” he said. “I am ashamed of my long delay, and I can only say to\nyou, frankly, that my time this winter has not been my own.” Rowland\nassented, ungrudgingly fumbled for the Italian correlative of the adage\n“Better late than never,” begged him to be seated, and offered him a\ncigar. The Cavaliere sniffed imperceptibly the fragrant weed, and then\ndeclared that, if his kind host would allow him, he would reserve it for\nconsumption at another time. He apparently desired to intimate that\nthe solemnity of his errand left him no breath for idle smoke-puffings.\nRowland stayed himself, just in time, from an enthusiastic offer of a\ndozen more cigars, and, as he watched the Cavaliere stow his treasure\ntenderly away in his pocket-book, reflected that only an Italian could\ngo through such a performance with uncompromised dignity. “I must\nconfess,” the little old man resumed, “that even now I come on business\nnot of my own--or my own, at least, only in a secondary sense. I have\nbeen dispatched as an ambassador, an envoy extraordinary, I may say, by\nmy dear friend Mrs. Light.”\n\n“If I can in any way be of service to Mrs. Light, I shall be happy,”\n Rowland said.\n\n“Well then, dear sir, Casa Light is in commotion. The signora is in\ntrouble--in terrible trouble.” For a moment Rowland expected to hear\nthat the signora’s trouble was of a nature that a loan of five thousand\nfrancs would assuage. But the Cavaliere continued: “Miss Light has\ncommitted a great crime; she has plunged a dagger into the heart of her\nmother.”\n\n“A dagger!” cried Rowland.\n\nThe Cavaliere patted the air an instant with his finger-tips. “I speak\nfiguratively. She has broken off her marriage.”\n\n“Broken it off?”\n\n“Short! She has turned the prince from the door.” And the Cavaliere,\nwhen he had made this announcement, folded his arms and bent upon\nRowland his intense, inscrutable gaze. It seemed to Rowland that he\ndetected in the polished depths of it a sort of fantastic gleam of\nirony or of triumph; but superficially, at least, Giacosa did nothing\nto discredit his character as a presumably sympathetic representative of\nMrs. Light’s affliction.\n\nRowland heard his news with a kind of fierce disgust; it seemed the\nsinister counterpart of Christina’s preternatural mildness at Madame\nGrandoni’s tea-party. She had been too plausible to be honest. Without\nbeing able to trace the connection, he yet instinctively associated her\npresent rebellion with her meeting with Mary Garland. If she had not\nseen Mary, she would have let things stand. It was monstrous to suppose\nthat she could have sacrificed so brilliant a fortune to a mere movement\nof jealousy, to a refined instinct of feminine deviltry, to a desire to\nfrighten poor Mary from her security by again appearing in the field.\nYet Rowland remembered his first impression of her; she was “dangerous,”\n and she had measured in each direction the perturbing effect of her\nrupture. She was smiling her sweetest smile at it! For half an hour\nRowland simply detested her, and longed to denounce her to her face. Of\ncourse all he could say to Giacosa was that he was extremely sorry. “But\nI am not surprised,” he added.\n\n“You are not surprised?”\n\n“With Miss Light everything is possible. Is n’t that true?”\n\nAnother ripple seemed to play for an instant in the current of the old\nman’s irony, but he waived response. “It was a magnificent marriage,”\n he said, solemnly. “I do not respect many people, but I respect Prince\nCasamassima.”\n\n“I should judge him indeed to be a very honorable young man,” said\nRowland.\n\n“Eh, young as he is, he ‘s made of the old stuff. And now, perhaps he\n‘s blowing his brains out. He is the last of his house; it ‘s a great\nhouse. But Miss Light will have put an end to it!”\n\n“Is that the view she takes of it?” Rowland ventured to ask.\n\nThis time, unmistakably, the Cavaliere smiled, but still in that very\nout-of-the-way place. “You have observed Miss Light with attention,” he\nsaid, “and this brings me to my errand. Mrs. Light has a high opinion\nof your wisdom, of your kindness, and she has reason to believe you have\ninfluence with her daughter.”\n\n“I--with her daughter? Not a grain!”\n\n“That is possibly your modesty. Mrs. Light believes that something may\nyet be done, and that Christina will listen to you. She begs you to come\nand see her before it is too late.”\n\n“But all this, my dear Cavaliere, is none of my business,” Rowland\nobjected. “I can’t possibly, in such a matter, take the responsibility\nof advising Miss Light.”\n\nThe Cavaliere fixed his eyes for a moment on the floor, in brief but\nintense reflection. Then looking up, “Unfortunately,” he said, “she has\nno man near her whom she respects; she has no father!”\n\n“And a fatally foolish mother!” Rowland gave himself the satisfaction of\nexclaiming.\n\nThe Cavaliere was so pale that he could not easily have turned paler;\nyet it seemed for a moment that his dead complexion blanched. “Eh,\nsignore, such as she is, the mother appeals to you. A very handsome\nwoman--disheveled, in tears, in despair, in dishabille!”\n\nRowland reflected a moment, not on the attractions of Mrs. Light\nunder the circumstances thus indicated by the Cavaliere, but on the\nsatisfaction he would take in accusing Christina to her face of having\nstruck a cruel blow.\n\n“I must add,” said the Cavaliere, “that Mrs. Light desires also to speak\nto you on the subject of Mr. Hudson.”\n\n“She considers Mr. Hudson, then, connected with this step of her\ndaughter’s?”\n\n“Intimately. He must be got out of Rome.”\n\n“Mrs. Light, then, must get an order from the Pope to remove him. It ‘s\nnot in my power.”\n\nThe Cavaliere assented, deferentially. “Mrs. Light is equally helpless.\nShe would leave Rome to-morrow, but Christina will not budge. An order\nfrom the Pope would do nothing. A bull in council would do nothing.”\n\n“She ‘s a remarkable young lady,” said Rowland, with bitterness.\n\nBut the Cavaliere rose and responded coldly, “She has a great spirit.”\n And it seemed to Rowland that her great spirit, for mysterious reasons,\ngave him more pleasure than the distressing use she made of it gave him\npain. He was on the point of charging him with his inconsistency, when\nGiacosa resumed: “But if the marriage can be saved, it must be saved. It\n‘s a beautiful marriage. It will be saved.”\n\n“Notwithstanding Miss Light’s great spirit to the contrary?”\n\n“Miss Light, notwithstanding her great spirit, will call Prince\nCasamassima back.”\n\n“Heaven grant it!” said Rowland.\n\n“I don’t know,” said the Cavaliere, solemnly, “that heaven will have\nmuch to do with it.”\n\nRowland gave him a questioning look, but he laid his finger on his lips.\nAnd with Rowland’s promise to present himself on the morrow at Casa\nLight, he shortly afterwards departed. He left Rowland revolving many\nthings: Christina’s magnanimity, Christina’s perversity, Roderick’s\ncontingent fortune, Mary Garland’s certain trouble, and the Cavaliere’s\nown fine ambiguities.\n\nRowland’s promise to the Cavaliere obliged him to withdraw from an\nexcursion which he had arranged with the two ladies from Northampton.\nBefore going to Casa Light he repaired in person to Mrs. Hudson’s hotel,\nto make his excuses.\n\nHe found Roderick’s mother sitting with tearful eyes, staring at an open\nnote that lay in her lap. At the window sat Miss Garland, who turned her\nintense regard upon him as he came in. Mrs. Hudson quickly rose and came\nto him, holding out the note.\n\n“In pity’s name,” she cried, “what is the matter with my boy? If he is\nill, I entreat you to take me to him!”\n\n“He is not ill, to my knowledge,” said Rowland. “What have you there?”\n\n“A note--a dreadful note. He tells us we are not to see him for a week.\nIf I could only go to his room! But I am afraid, I am afraid!”\n\n“I imagine there is no need of going to his room. What is the occasion,\nmay I ask, of his note?”\n\n“He was to have gone with us on this drive to--what is the place?--to\nCervara. You know it was arranged yesterday morning. In the evening he\nwas to have dined with us. But he never came, and this morning arrives\nthis awful thing. Oh dear, I ‘m so excited! Would you mind reading it?”\n\nRowland took the note and glanced at its half-dozen lines. “I cannot go\nto Cervara,” they ran; “I have something else to do. This will occupy me\nperhaps for a week, and you ‘ll not see me. Don’t miss me--learn not to\nmiss me. R. H.”\n\n“Why, it means,” Rowland commented, “that he has taken up a piece\nof work, and that it is all-absorbing. That ‘s very good news.” This\nexplanation was not sincere; but he had not the courage not to offer it\nas a stop-gap. But he found he needed all his courage to maintain it,\nfor Miss Garland had left her place and approached him, formidably\nunsatisfied.\n\n“He does not work in the evening,” said Mrs. Hudson. “Can’t he come\nfor five minutes? Why does he write such a cruel, cold note to his poor\nmother--to poor Mary? What have we done that he acts so strangely? It\n‘s this wicked, infectious, heathenish place!” And the poor lady’s\nsuppressed mistrust of the Eternal City broke out passionately. “Oh,\ndear Mr. Mallet,” she went on, “I am sure he has the fever and he ‘s\nalready delirious!”\n\n“I am very sure it ‘s not that,” said Miss Garland, with a certain\ndryness.\n\nShe was still looking at Rowland; his eyes met hers, and his own glance\nfell. This made him angry, and to carry off his confusion he pretended\nto be looking at the floor, in meditation. After all, what had he to be\nashamed of? For a moment he was on the point of making a clean breast of\nit, of crying out, “Dearest friends, I abdicate: I can’t help you!” But\nhe checked himself; he felt so impatient to have his three words with\nChristina. He grasped his hat.\n\n“I will see what it is!” he cried. And then he was glad he had not\nabdicated, for as he turned away he glanced again at Mary and saw that,\nthough her eyes were full of trouble, they were not hard and accusing,\nbut charged with appealing friendship.\n\nHe went straight to Roderick’s apartment, deeming this, at an early\nhour, the safest place to seek him. He found him in his sitting-room,\nwhich had been closely darkened to keep out the heat. The carpets and\nrugs had been removed, the floor of speckled concrete was bare and\nlightly sprinkled with water. Here and there, over it, certain strongly\nperfumed flowers had been scattered. Roderick was lying on his divan in\na white dressing-gown, staring up at the frescoed ceiling. The room\nwas deliciously cool, and filled with the moist, sweet odor of the\ncircumjacent roses and violets. All this seemed highly fantastic, and\nyet Rowland hardly felt surprised.\n\n“Your mother was greatly alarmed at your note,” he said, “and I came\nto satisfy myself that, as I believed, you are not ill.” Roderick lay\nmotionless, except that he slightly turned his head toward his friend.\nHe was smelling a large white rose, and he continued to present it to\nhis nose. In the darkness of the room he looked exceedingly pale, but\nhis handsome eyes had an extraordinary brilliancy. He let them rest for\nsome time on Rowland, lying there like a Buddhist in an intellectual\nswoon, whose perception should be slowly ebbing back to temporal\nmatters. “Oh, I ‘m not ill,” he said at last. “I have never been\nbetter.”\n\n“Your note, nevertheless, and your absence,” Rowland said, “have very\nnaturally alarmed your mother. I advise you to go to her directly and\nreassure her.”\n\n“Go to her? Going to her would be worse than staying away. Staying away\nat present is a kindness.” And he inhaled deeply his huge rose, looking\nup over it at Rowland. “My presence, in fact, would be indecent.”\n\n“Indecent? Pray explain.”\n\n“Why, you see, as regards Mary Garland. I am divinely happy! Does n’t\nit strike you? You ought to agree with me. You wish me to spare her\nfeelings; I spare them by staying away. Last night I heard something”--\n\n“I heard it, too,” said Rowland with brevity. “And it ‘s in honor of\nthis piece of news that you have taken to your bed in this fashion?”\n\n“Extremes meet! I can’t get up for joy.”\n\n“May I inquire how you heard your joyous news?--from Miss Light\nherself?”\n\n“By no means. It was brought me by her maid, who is in my service as\nwell.”\n\n“Casamassima’s loss, then, is to a certainty your gain?”\n\n“I don’t talk about certainties. I don’t want to be arrogant, I don’t\nwant to offend the immortal gods. I ‘m keeping very quiet, but I can’t\nhelp being happy. I shall wait a while; I shall bide my time.”\n\n“And then?”\n\n“And then that transcendent girl will confess to me that when she threw\noverboard her prince she remembered that I adored her!”\n\n“I feel bound to tell you,” was in the course of a moment Rowland’s\nresponse to this speech, “that I am now on my way to Mrs. Light’s.”\n\n“I congratulate you, I envy you!” Roderick murmured, imperturbably.\n\n“Mrs. Light has sent for me to remonstrate with her daughter, with whom\nshe has taken it into her head that I have influence. I don’t know to\nwhat extent I shall remonstrate, but I give you notice I shall not speak\nin your interest.”\n\nRoderick looked at him a moment with a lazy radiance in his eyes. “Pray\ndon’t!” he simply answered.\n\n“You deserve I should tell her you are a very shabby fellow.”\n\n“My dear Rowland, the comfort with you is that I can trust you. You ‘re\nincapable of doing anything disloyal.”\n\n“You mean to lie here, then, smelling your roses and nursing your\nvisions, and leaving your mother and Miss Garland to fall ill with\nanxiety?”\n\n“Can I go and flaunt my felicity in their faces? Wait till I get used\nto it a trifle. I have done them a palpable wrong, but I can at least\nforbear to add insult to injury. I may be an arrant fool, but, for\nthe moment, I have taken it into my head to be prodigiously pleased. I\nshould n’t be able to conceal it; my pleasure would offend them; so I\nlock myself up as a dangerous character.”\n\n“Well, I can only say, ‘May your pleasure never grow less, or your\ndanger greater!’”\n\nRoderick closed his eyes again, and sniffed at his rose. “God’s will be\ndone!”\n\nOn this Rowland left him and repaired directly to Mrs. Light’s. This\nafflicted lady hurried forward to meet him. Since the Cavaliere’s report\nof her condition she had somewhat smoothed and trimmed the exuberance\nof her distress, but she was evidently in extreme tribulation, and she\nclutched Rowland by his two hands, as if, in the shipwreck of her hopes,\nhe were her single floating spar. Rowland greatly pitied her, for there\nis something respectable in passionate grief, even in a very bad cause;\nand as pity is akin to love, he endured her rather better than he had\ndone hitherto.\n\n“Speak to her, plead with her, command her!” she cried, pressing and\nshaking his hands. “She ‘ll not heed us, no more than if we were a pair\nof clocks a-ticking. Perhaps she will listen to you; she always liked\nyou.”\n\n“She always disliked me,” said Rowland. “But that does n’t matter now.\nI have come here simply because you sent for me, not because I can help\nyou. I cannot advise your daughter.”\n\n“Oh, cruel, deadly man! You must advise her; you shan’t leave this house\ntill you have advised her!” the poor woman passionately retorted. “Look\nat me in my misery and refuse to help me! Oh, you need n’t be afraid, I\nknow I ‘m a fright, I have n’t an idea what I have on. If this goes\non, we may both as well turn scarecrows. If ever a woman was desperate,\nfrantic, heart-broken, I am that woman. I can’t begin to tell you. To\nhave nourished a serpent, sir, all these years! to have lavished one’s\nself upon a viper that turns and stings her own poor mother! To have\ntoiled and prayed, to have pushed and struggled, to have eaten the bread\nof bitterness, and all the rest of it, sir--and at the end of all things\nto find myself at this pass. It can’t be, it ‘s too cruel, such things\ndon’t happen, the Lord don’t allow it. I ‘m a religious woman, sir,\nand the Lord knows all about me. With his own hand he had given me his\nreward! I would have lain down in the dust and let her walk over me; I\nwould have given her the eyes out of my head, if she had taken a fancy\nto them. No, she ‘s a cruel, wicked, heartless, unnatural girl! I speak\nto you, Mr. Mallet, in my dire distress, as to my only friend. There is\nn’t a creature here that I can look to--not one of them all that I have\nfaith in. But I always admired you. I said to Christina the first time I\nsaw you that there at last was a real gentleman. Come, don’t disappoint\nme now! I feel so terribly alone, you see; I feel what a nasty, hard,\nheartless world it is that has come and devoured my dinners and danced\nto my fiddles, and yet that has n’t a word to throw to me in my agony!\nOh, the money, alone, that I have put into this thing, would melt the\nheart of a Turk!”\n\nDuring this frenzied outbreak Rowland had had time to look round the\nroom, and to see the Cavaliere sitting in a corner, like a major-domo on\nthe divan of an antechamber, pale, rigid, and inscrutable.\n\n“I have it at heart to tell you,” Rowland said, “that if you consider my\nfriend Hudson”--\n\nMrs. Light gave a toss of her head and hands. “Oh, it ‘s not that. She\ntold me last night to bother her no longer with Hudson, Hudson! She did\nn’t care a button for Hudson. I almost wish she did; then perhaps one\nmight understand it. But she does n’t care for anything in the wide\nworld, except to do her own hard, wicked will, and to crush me and shame\nme with her cruelty.”\n\n“Ah, then,” said Rowland, “I am as much at sea as you, and my presence\nhere is an impertinence. I should like to say three words to Miss Light\non my own account. But I must absolutely and inexorably decline to urge\nthe cause of Prince Casamassima. This is simply impossible.”\n\nMrs. Light burst into angry tears. “Because the poor boy is a prince,\neh? because he ‘s of a great family, and has an income of millions, eh?\nThat ‘s why you grudge him and hate him. I knew there were vulgar people\nof that way of feeling, but I did n’t expect it of you. Make an effort,\nMr. Mallet; rise to the occasion; forgive the poor fellow his splendor.\nBe just, be reasonable! It ‘s not his fault, and it ‘s not mine. He ‘s\nthe best, the kindest young man in the world, and the most correct and\nmoral and virtuous! If he were standing here in rags, I would say it all\nthe same. The man first--the money afterwards: that was always my motto,\nand always will be. What do you take me for? Do you suppose I would\ngive Christina to a vicious person? do you suppose I would sacrifice my\nprecious child, little comfort as I have in her, to a man against whose\ncharacter one word could be breathed? Casamassima is only too good, he\n‘s a saint of saints, he ‘s stupidly good! There is n’t such another\nin the length and breadth of Europe. What he has been through in this\nhouse, not a common peasant would endure. Christina has treated him as\nyou would n’t treat a dog. He has been insulted, outraged, persecuted!\nHe has been driven hither and thither till he did n’t know where he\nwas. He has stood there where you stand--there, with his name and his\nmillions and his devotion--as white as your handkerchief, with hot tears\nin his eyes, and me ready to go down on my knees to him and say, ‘My own\nsweet prince, I could kiss the ground you tread on, but it is n’t decent\nthat I should allow you to enter my house and expose yourself to these\nhorrors again.’ And he would come back, and he would come back, and go\nthrough it all again, and take all that was given him, and only want the\ngirl the more! I was his confidant; I know everything. He used to beg\nmy forgiveness for Christina. What do you say to that? I seized him once\nand kissed him, I did! To find that and to find all the rest with it,\nand to believe it was a gift straight from the pitying angels of heaven,\nand then to see it dashed away before your eyes and to stand here\nhelpless--oh, it ‘s a fate I hope you may ever be spared!”\n\n“It would seem, then, that in the interest of Prince Casamassima himself\nI ought to refuse to interfere,” said Rowland.\n\nMrs. Light looked at him hard, slowly drying her eyes. The intensity\nof her grief and anger gave her a kind of majesty, and Rowland, for\nthe moment, felt ashamed of the ironical ring of his observation. “Very\ngood, sir,” she said. “I ‘m sorry your heart is not so tender as your\nconscience. My compliments to your conscience! It must give you great\nhappiness. Heaven help me! Since you fail us, we are indeed driven to\nthe wall. But I have fought my own battles before, and I have never lost\ncourage, and I don’t see why I should break down now. Cavaliere, come\nhere!”\n\nGiacosa rose at her summons and advanced with his usual deferential\nalacrity. He shook hands with Rowland in silence.\n\n“Mr. Mallet refuses to say a word,” Mrs. Light went on. “Time presses,\nevery moment is precious. Heaven knows what that poor boy may be doing.\nIf at this moment a clever woman should get hold of him she might be as\nugly as she pleased! It ‘s horrible to think of it.”\n\nThe Cavaliere fixed his eyes on Rowland, and his look, which the night\nbefore had been singular, was now most extraordinary. There was a\nnameless force of anguish in it which seemed to grapple with the young\nman’s reluctance, to plead, to entreat, and at the same time to be\nglazed over with a reflection of strange things.\n\nSuddenly, though most vaguely, Rowland felt the presence of a new\nelement in the drama that was going on before him. He looked from the\nCavaliere to Mrs. Light, whose eyes were now quite dry, and were fixed\nin stony hardness on the floor.\n\n“If you could bring yourself,” the Cavaliere said, in a low, soft,\ncaressing voice, “to address a few words of solemn remonstrance to Miss\nLight, you would, perhaps, do more for us than you know. You would\nsave several persons a great pain. The dear signora, first, and then\nChristina herself. Christina in particular. Me too, I might take the\nliberty to add!”\n\nThere was, to Rowland, something acutely touching in this humble\npetition. He had always felt a sort of imaginative tenderness for poor\nlittle unexplained Giacosa, and these words seemed a supreme contortion\nof the mysterious obliquity of his life. All of a sudden, as he watched\nthe Cavaliere, something occurred to him; it was something very odd, and\nit stayed his glance suddenly from again turning to Mrs. Light. His idea\nembarrassed him, and to carry off his embarrassment, he repeated that\nit was folly to suppose that his words would have any weight with\nChristina.\n\nThe Cavaliere stepped forward and laid two fingers on Rowland’s breast.\n“Do you wish to know the truth? You are the only man whose words she\nremembers.”\n\nRowland was going from surprise to surprise. “I will say what I can!”\n he said. By this time he had ventured to glance at Mrs. Light. She was\nlooking at him askance, as if, upon this, she was suddenly mistrusting\nhis motives.\n\n“If you fail,” she said sharply, “we have something else! But please to\nlose no time.”\n\nShe had hardly spoken when the sound of a short, sharp growl caused the\ncompany to turn. Christina’s fleecy poodle stood in the middle of the\nvast saloon, with his muzzle lowered, in pompous defiance of the three\nconspirators against the comfort of his mistress. This young lady’s\nclaims for him seemed justified; he was an animal of amazingly delicate\ninstincts. He had preceded Christina as a sort of van-guard of defense,\nand she now slowly advanced from a neighboring room.\n\n“You will be so good as to listen to Mr. Mallet,” her mother said, in a\nterrible voice, “and to reflect carefully upon what he says. I suppose\nyou will admit that he is disinterested. In half an hour you shall hear\nfrom me again!” And passing her hand through the Cavaliere’s arm, she\nswept rapidly out of the room.\n\nChristina looked hard at Rowland, but offered him no greeting. She was\nvery pale, and, strangely enough, it at first seemed to Rowland that\nher beauty was in eclipse. But he very soon perceived that it had only\nchanged its character, and that if it was a trifle less brilliant than\nusual, it was admirably touching and noble. The clouded light of her\neyes, the magnificent gravity of her features, the conscious erectness\nof her head, might have belonged to a deposed sovereign or a condemned\nmartyr. “Why have you come here at this time?” she asked.\n\n“Your mother sent for me in pressing terms, and I was very glad to have\nan opportunity to speak to you.”\n\n“Have you come to help me, or to persecute me?”\n\n“I have as little power to do one as I have desire to do the other.\nI came in great part to ask you a question. First, your decision is\nirrevocable?”\n\nChristina’s two hands had been hanging clasped in front of her; she\nseparated them and flung them apart by an admirable gesture.\n\n“Would you have done this if you had not seen Miss Garland?”\n\nShe looked at him with quickened attention; then suddenly, “This is\ninteresting!” she cried. “Let us have it out.” And she flung herself\ninto a chair and pointed to another.\n\n“You don’t answer my question,” Rowland said.\n\n“You have no right, that I know of, to ask it. But it ‘s a very clever\none; so clever that it deserves an answer. Very likely I would not.”\n\n“Last night, when I said that to myself, I was extremely angry,” Rowland\nrejoined.\n\n“Oh, dear, and you are not angry now?”\n\n“I am less angry.”\n\n“How very stupid! But you can say something at least.”\n\n“If I were to say what is uppermost in my mind, I would say that, face\nto face with you, it is never possible to condemn you.”\n\n“Perche?”\n\n“You know, yourself! But I can at least say now what I felt last night.\nIt seemed to me that you had consciously, cruelly dealt a blow at that\npoor girl. Do you understand?”\n\n“Wait a moment!” And with her eyes fixed on him, she inclined her head\non one side, meditatively. Then a cold, brilliant smile covered\nher face, and she made a gesture of negation. “I see your train of\nreasoning, but it ‘s quite wrong. I meant no harm to Miss Garland; I\nshould be extremely sorry to make her suffer. Tell me you believe that.”\n\nThis was said with ineffable candor. Rowland heard himself answering, “I\nbelieve it!”\n\n“And yet, in a sense, your supposition was true,” Christina continued.\n“I conceived, as I told you, a great admiration for Miss Garland, and I\nfrankly confess I was jealous of her. What I envied her was simply\nher character! I said to myself, ‘She, in my place, would n’t marry\nCasamassima.’ I could not help saying it, and I said it so often that I\nfound a kind of inspiration in it. I hated the idea of being worse than\nshe--of doing something that she would n’t do. I might be bad by nature,\nbut I need n’t be by volition. The end of it all was that I found it\nimpossible not to tell the prince that I was his very humble servant,\nbut that I could not marry him.”\n\n“Are you sure it was only of Miss Garland’s character that you were\njealous, not of--not of”--\n\n“Speak out, I beg you. We are talking philosophy!”\n\n“Not of her affection for her cousin?”\n\n“Sure is a good deal to ask. Still, I think I may say it! There are two\nreasons; one, at least, I can tell you: her affection has not a shadow’s\nweight with Mr. Hudson! Why then should one fear it?”\n\n“And what is the other reason?”\n\n“Excuse me; that is my own affair.”\n\nRowland was puzzled, baffled, charmed, inspired, almost, all at once. “I\nhave promised your mother,” he presently resumed, “to say something in\nfavor of Prince Casamassima.”\n\nShe shook her head sadly. “Prince Casamassima needs nothing that you can\nsay for him. He is a magnificent parti. I know it perfectly.”\n\n“You know also of the extreme affliction of your mother?”\n\n“Her affliction is demonstrative. She has been abusing me for the last\ntwenty-four hours as if I were the vilest of the vile.” To see Christina\nsit there in the purity of her beauty and say this, might have made one\nbow one’s head with a kind of awe. “I have failed of respect to her\nat other times, but I have not done so now. Since we are talking\nphilosophy,” she pursued with a gentle smile, “I may say it ‘s a simple\nmatter! I don’t love him. Or rather, perhaps, since we are talking\nphilosophy, I may say it ‘s not a simple matter. I spoke just now of\ninspiration. The inspiration has been great, but--I frankly confess\nit--the choice has been hard. Shall I tell you?” she demanded, with\nsudden ardor; “will you understand me? It was on the one side the world,\nthe splendid, beautiful, powerful, interesting world. I know what that\nis; I have tasted of the cup, I know its sweetness. Ah, if I chose, if I\nlet myself go, if I flung everything to the winds, the world and I would\nbe famous friends! I know its merits, and I think, without vanity, it\nwould see mine. You would see some fine things! I should like to be a\nprincess, and I think I should be a very good one; I would play my part\nwell. I am fond of luxury, I am fond of a great society, I am fond of\nbeing looked at. I am corrupt, corruptible, corruption! Ah, what a pity\nthat could n’t be, too! Mercy of Heaven!” There was a passionate tremor\nin her voice; she covered her face with her hands and sat motionless.\nRowland saw that an intense agitation, hitherto successfully repressed,\nunderlay her calmness, and he could easily believe that her battle had\nbeen fierce. She rose quickly and turned away, walked a few paces, and\nstopped. In a moment she was facing him again, with tears in her eyes\nand a flush in her cheeks. “But you need n’t think I ‘m afraid!” she\nsaid. “I have chosen, and I shall hold to it. I have something here,\nhere, here!” and she patted her heart. “It ‘s my own. I shan’t part\nwith it. Is it what you call an ideal? I don’t know; I don’t care! It is\nbrighter than the Casamassima diamonds!”\n\n“You say that certain things are your own affair,” Rowland presently\nrejoined; “but I must nevertheless make an attempt to learn what all\nthis means--what it promises for my friend Hudson. Is there any hope for\nhim?”\n\n“This is a point I can’t discuss with you minutely. I like him very\nmuch.”\n\n“Would you marry him if he were to ask you?”\n\n“He has asked me.”\n\n“And if he asks again?”\n\n“I shall marry no one just now.”\n\n“Roderick,” said Rowland, “has great hopes.”\n\n“Does he know of my rupture with the prince?”\n\n“He is making a great holiday of it.”\n\nChristina pulled her poodle towards her and began to smooth his silky\nfleece. “I like him very much,” she repeated; “much more than I used to.\nSince you told me all that about him at Saint Cecilia’s, I have felt a\ngreat friendship for him. There ‘s something very fine about him; he ‘s\nnot afraid of anything. He is not afraid of failure; he is not afraid of\nruin or death.”\n\n“Poor fellow!” said Rowland, bitterly; “he is fatally picturesque.”\n\n“Picturesque, yes; that ‘s what he is. I am very sorry for him.”\n\n“Your mother told me just now that you had said that you did n’t care a\nstraw for him.”\n\n“Very likely! I meant as a lover. One does n’t want a lover one pities,\nand one does n’t want--of all things in the world--a picturesque\nhusband! I should like Mr. Hudson as something else. I wish he were my\nbrother, so that he could never talk to me of marriage. Then I could\nadore him. I would nurse him, I would wait on him and save him all\ndisagreeable rubs and shocks. I am much stronger than he, and I would\nstand between him and the world. Indeed, with Mr. Hudson for my brother,\nI should be willing to live and die an old maid!”\n\n“Have you ever told him all this?”\n\n“I suppose so; I ‘ve told him five hundred things! If it would please\nyou, I will tell him again.”\n\n“Oh, Heaven forbid!” cried poor Rowland, with a groan.\n\nHe was lingering there, weighing his sympathy against his irritation,\nand feeling it sink in the scale, when the curtain of a distant doorway\nwas lifted and Mrs. Light passed across the room. She stopped half-way,\nand gave the young persons a flushed and menacing look. It found\napparently little to reassure her, and she moved away with a passionate\ntoss of her drapery. Rowland thought with horror of the sinister\ncompulsion to which the young girl was to be subjected. In this ethereal\nflight of hers there was a certain painful effort and tension of wing;\nbut it was none the less piteous to imagine her being rudely jerked down\nto the base earth she was doing her adventurous utmost to spurn. She\nwould need all her magnanimity for her own trial, and it seemed gross to\nmake further demands upon it on Roderick’s behalf.\n\nRowland took up his hat. “You asked a while ago if I had come to help\nyou,” he said. “If I knew how I might help you, I should be particularly\nglad.”\n\nShe stood silent a moment, reflecting. Then at last, looking up, “You\nremember,” she said, “your promising me six months ago to tell me what\nyou finally thought of me? I should like you to tell me now.”\n\nHe could hardly help smiling. Madame Grandoni had insisted on the fact\nthat Christina was an actress, though a sincere one; and this little\nspeech seemed a glimpse of the cloven foot. She had played her great\nscene, she had made her point, and now she had her eye at the hole\nin the curtain and she was watching the house! But she blushed as she\nperceived his smile, and her blush, which was beautiful, made her fault\nvenial.\n\n“You are an excellent girl!” he said, in a particular tone, and gave her\nhis hand in farewell.\n\nThere was a great chain of rooms in Mrs. Light’s apartment, the pride\nand joy of the hostess on festal evenings, through which the departing\nvisitor passed before reaching the door. In one of the first of these\nRowland found himself waylaid and arrested by the distracted lady\nherself.\n\n“Well, well?” she cried, seizing his arm. “Has she listened to you--have\nyou moved her?”\n\n“In Heaven’s name, dear madame,” Rowland begged, “leave the poor girl\nalone! She is behaving very well!”\n\n“Behaving very well? Is that all you have to tell me? I don’t believe\nyou said a proper word to her. You are conspiring together to kill me!”\n\nRowland tried to soothe her, to remonstrate, to persuade her that it was\nequally cruel and unwise to try to force matters. But she answered him\nonly with harsh lamentations and imprecations, and ended by telling him\nthat her daughter was her property, not his, and that his interference\nwas most insolent and most scandalous. Her disappointment seemed really\nto have crazed her, and his only possible rejoinder was to take a\nsummary departure.\n\nA moment later he came upon the Cavaliere, who was sitting with his\nelbows on his knees and his head in his hands, so buried in thought that\nRowland had to call him before he roused himself. Giacosa looked at him\na moment keenly, and then gave a shake of the head, interrogatively.\n\nRowland gave a shake negative, to which the Cavaliere responded by a\nlong, melancholy sigh. “But her mother is determined to force matters,”\n said Rowland.\n\n“It seems that it must be!”\n\n“Do you consider that it must be?”\n\n“I don’t differ with Mrs. Light!”\n\n“It will be a great cruelty!”\n\nThe Cavaliere gave a tragic shrug. “Eh! it is n’t an easy world.”\n\n“You should do nothing to make it harder, then.”\n\n“What will you have? It ‘s a magnificent marriage.”\n\n“You disappoint me, Cavaliere,” said Rowland, solemnly. “I imagined you\nappreciated the great elevation of Miss Light’s attitude. She does n’t\nlove the prince; she has let the matter stand or fall by that.”\n\nThe old man grasped him by the hand and stood a moment with averted\neyes. At last, looking at him, he held up two fingers.\n\n“I have two hearts,” he said, “one for myself, one for the world. This\none opposes Miss Light, the other adores her! One suffers horribly at\nwhat the other does.”\n\n“I don’t understand double people, Cavaliere,” Rowland said, “and I\ndon’t pretend to understand you. But I have guessed that you are going\nto play some secret card.”\n\n“The card is Mrs. Light’s, not mine,” said the Cavaliere.\n\n“It ‘s a menace, at any rate?”\n\n“The sword of Damocles! It hangs by a hair. Christina is to be given ten\nminutes to recant, under penalty of having it fall. On the blade there\nis something written in strange characters. Don’t scratch your head; you\nwill not make it out.”\n\n“I think I have guessed it,” Rowland said, after a pregnant silence. The\nCavaliere looked at him blankly but intently, and Rowland added, “Though\nthere are some signs, indeed, I don’t understand.”\n\n“Puzzle them out at your leisure,” said the Cavaliere, shaking his hand.\n“I hear Mrs. Light; I must go to my post. I wish you were a Catholic; I\nwould beg you to step into the first church you come to, and pray for us\nthe next half-hour.”\n\n“For ‘us’? For whom?”\n\n“For all of us. At any rate remember this: I worship the Christina!”\n\nRowland heard the rustle of Mrs. Light’s dress; he turned away, and the\nCavaliere went, as he said, to his post. Rowland for the next couple of\ndays pondered his riddle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Mrs. Hudson\n\nOf Roderick, meanwhile, Rowland saw nothing; but he immediately went to\nMrs. Hudson and assured her that her son was in even exceptionally good\nhealth and spirits. After this he called again on the two ladies from\nNorthampton, but, as Roderick’s absence continued, he was able neither\nto furnish nor to obtain much comfort. Miss Garland’s apprehensive\nface seemed to him an image of his own state of mind. He was profoundly\ndepressed; he felt that there was a storm in the air, and he wished\nit would come, without more delay, and perform its ravages. On the\nafternoon of the third day he went into Saint Peter’s, his frequent\nresort whenever the outer world was disagreeable. From a heart-ache to\na Roman rain there were few importunate pains the great church did not\nhelp him to forget. He had wandered there for half an hour, when he came\nupon a short figure, lurking in the shadow of one of the great piers. He\nsaw it was that of an artist, hastily transferring to his sketch-book a\nmemento of some fleeting variation in the scenery of the basilica; and\nin a moment he perceived that the artist was little Sam Singleton.\n\nSingleton pocketed his sketch-book with a guilty air, as if it cost his\nmodesty a pang to be detected in this greedy culture of opportunity.\nRowland always enjoyed meeting him; talking with him, in these days,\nwas as good as a wayside gush of clear, cold water, on a long, hot walk.\nThere was, perhaps, no drinking-vessel, and you had to apply your lips\nto some simple natural conduit; but the result was always a sense of\nextreme moral refreshment. On this occasion he mentally blessed the\ningenuous little artist, and heard presently with keen regret that he\nwas to leave Rome on the morrow. Singleton had come to bid farewell\nto Saint Peter’s, and he was gathering a few supreme memories. He had\nearned a purse-full of money, and he was meaning to take a summer’s\nholiday; going to Switzerland, to Germany, to Paris. In the autumn he\nwas to return home; his family--composed, as Rowland knew, of a father\nwho was cashier in a bank and five unmarried sisters, one of whom gave\nlyceum-lectures on woman’s rights, the whole resident at Buffalo, New\nYork--had been writing him peremptory letters and appealing to him as\na son, brother, and fellow-citizen. He would have been grateful for\nanother year in Rome, but what must be must be, and he had laid up\ntreasure which, in Buffalo, would seem infinite. They talked some time;\nRowland hoped they might meet in Switzerland, and take a walk or two\ntogether. Singleton seemed to feel that Buffalo had marked him for her\nown; he was afraid he should not see Rome again for many a year.\n\n“So you expect to live at Buffalo?” Rowland asked sympathetically.\n\n“Well, it will depend upon the views--upon the attitude--of my family,”\n Singleton replied. “Oh, I think I shall get on; I think it can be done.\nIf I find it can be done, I shall really be quite proud of it; as an\nartist of course I mean, you know. Do you know I have some nine hundred\nsketches? I shall live in my portfolio. And so long as one is not in\nRome, pray what does it matter where one is? But how I shall envy all\nyou Romans--you and Mr. Gloriani, and Mr. Hudson, especially!”\n\n“Don’t envy Hudson; he has nothing to envy.”\n\nSingleton grinned at what he considered a harmless jest. “Yes, he ‘s\ngoing to be the great man of our time! And I say, Mr. Mallet, is n’t it\na mighty comfort that it ‘s we who have turned him out?”\n\n“Between ourselves,” said Rowland, “he has disappointed me.”\n\nSingleton stared, open-mouthed. “Dear me, what did you expect?”\n\n“Truly,” said Rowland to himself, “what did I expect?”\n\n“I confess,” cried Singleton, “I can’t judge him rationally. He\nfascinates me; he ‘s the sort of man one makes one’s hero of.”\n\n“Strictly speaking, he is not a hero,” said Rowland.\n\nSingleton looked intensely grave, and, with almost tearful eyes, “Is\nthere anything amiss--anything out of the way, about him?” he timidly\nasked. Then, as Rowland hesitated to reply, he quickly added, “Please,\nif there is, don’t tell me! I want to know no evil of him, and I think\nI should hardly believe it. In my memories of this Roman artist-life,\nhe will be the central figure. He will stand there in radiant relief, as\nbeautiful and unspotted as one of his own statues!”\n\n“Amen!” said Rowland, gravely. He remembered afresh that the sea is\ninhabited by big fishes and little, and that the latter often find their\nway down the throats of the former. Singleton was going to spend the\nafternoon in taking last looks at certain other places, and Rowland\noffered to join him on his sentimental circuit. But as they were\npreparing to leave the church, he heard himself suddenly addressed from\nbehind. Turning, he beheld a young woman whom he immediately recognized\nas Madame Grandoni’s maid. Her mistress was present, she said, and\nbegged to confer with him before he departed.\n\nThis summons obliged Rowland to separate from Singleton, to whom he bade\nfarewell. He followed the messenger, and presently found Madame Grandoni\noccupying a liberal area on the steps of the tribune, behind the great\naltar, where, spreading a shawl on the polished red marble, she had\ncomfortably seated herself. He expected that she had something especial\nto impart, and she lost no time in bringing forth her treasure.\n\n“Don’t shout very loud,” she said, “remember that we are in church;\nthere ‘s a limit to the noise one may make even in Saint Peter’s.\nChristina Light was married this morning to Prince Casamassima.”\n\nRowland did not shout at all; he gave a deep, short murmur:\n“Married--this morning?”\n\n“Married this morning, at seven o’clock, le plus tranquillement du\nmonde, before three or four persons. The young couple left Rome an hour\nafterwards.”\n\nFor some moments this seemed to him really terrible; the dark little\ndrama of which he had caught a glimpse had played itself out. He had\nbelieved that Christina would resist; that she had succumbed was a proof\nthat the pressure had been cruel. Rowland’s imagination followed her\nforth with an irresistible tremor into the world toward which she was\nrolling away, with her detested husband and her stifled ideal; but it\nmust be confessed that if the first impulse of his compassion was\nfor Christina, the second was for Prince Casamassima. Madame Grandoni\nacknowledged an extreme curiosity as to the secret springs of these\nstrange doings: Casamassima’s sudden dismissal, his still more sudden\nrecall, the hurried private marriage. “Listen,” said Rowland, hereupon,\n“and I will tell you something.” And he related, in detail, his last\nvisit to Mrs. Light and his talk with this lady, with Christina, and\nwith the Cavaliere.\n\n“Good,” she said; “it ‘s all very curious. But it ‘s a riddle, and I\nonly half guess it.”\n\n“Well,” said Rowland, “I desire to harm no one; but certain suppositions\nhave taken shape in my mind which serve as a solvent to several\nambiguities.”\n\n“It is very true,” Madame Grandoni answered, “that the Cavaliere, as he\nstands, has always needed to be explained.”\n\n“He is explained by the hypothesis that, three-and-twenty years ago, at\nAncona, Mrs. Light had a lover.”\n\n“I see. Ancona was dull, Mrs. Light was lively, and--three-and-twenty\nyears ago--perhaps, the Cavaliere was fascinating. Doubtless it would be\nfairer to say that he was fascinated. Poor Giacosa!”\n\n“He has had his compensation,” Rowland said. “He has been passionately\nfond of Christina.”\n\n“Naturally. But has Christina never wondered why?”\n\n“If she had been near guessing, her mother’s shabby treatment of him\nwould have put her off the scent. Mrs. Light’s conscience has apparently\ntold her that she could expiate an hour’s too great kindness by twenty\nyears’ contempt. So she kept her secret. But what is the profit of\nhaving a secret unless you can make some use of it? The day at last came\nwhen she could turn hers to account; she could let the skeleton out of\nthe closet and create a panic.”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Neither do I morally,” said Rowland. “I only conceive that there was a\nhorrible, fabulous scene. The poor Cavaliere stood outside, at the\ndoor, white as a corpse and as dumb. The mother and daughter had it out\ntogether. Mrs. Light burnt her ships. When she came out she had three\nlines of writing in her daughter’s hand, which the Cavaliere was\ndispatched with to the prince. They overtook the young man in time, and,\nwhen he reappeared, he was delighted to dispense with further waiting. I\ndon’t know what he thought of the look in his bride’s face; but that is\nhow I roughly reconstruct history.”\n\n“Christina was forced to decide, then, that she could not afford not to\nbe a princess?”\n\n“She was reduced by humiliation. She was assured that it was not for her\nto make conditions, but to thank her stars that there were none made for\nher. If she persisted, she might find it coming to pass that there would\nbe conditions, and the formal rupture--the rupture that the world would\nhear of and pry into--would then proceed from the prince and not from\nher.”\n\n“That ‘s all nonsense!” said Madame Grandoni, energetically.\n\n“To us, yes; but not to the proudest girl in the world, deeply wounded\nin her pride, and not stopping to calculate probabilities, but muffling\nher shame, with an almost sensuous relief, in a splendor that stood\nwithin her grasp and asked no questions. Is it not possible that the\nlate Mr. Light had made an outbreak before witnesses who are still\nliving?”\n\n“Certainly her marriage now,” said Madame Grandoni, less analytically,\n“has the advantage that it takes her away from her--parents!”\n\nThis lady’s farther comments upon the event are not immediately\npertinent to our history; there were some other comments of which\nRowland had a deeply oppressive foreboding. He called, on the evening\nof the morrow upon Mrs. Hudson, and found Roderick with the two\nladies. Their companion had apparently but lately entered, and Rowland\nafterwards learned that it was his first appearance since the writing of\nthe note which had so distressed his mother. He had flung himself upon\na sofa, where he sat with his chin upon his breast, staring before him\nwith a sinister spark in his eye. He fixed his gaze on Rowland, but gave\nhim no greeting. He had evidently been saying something to startle the\nwomen; Mrs. Hudson had gone and seated herself, timidly and imploringly,\non the edge of the sofa, trying to take his hand. Miss Garland was\napplying herself to some needlework with conscious intentness.\n\nMrs. Hudson gave Rowland, on his entrance, a touching look of gratitude.\n“Oh, we have such blessed news!” she said. “Roderick is ready to leave\nRome.”\n\n“It ‘s not blessed news; it ‘s most damnable news!” cried Roderick.\n\n“Oh, but we are very glad, my son, and I am sure you will be when you\nget away. You ‘re looking most dreadfully thin; is n’t he, Mr. Mallet?\nIt ‘s plain enough you need a change. I ‘m sure we will go wherever you\nlike. Where would you like to go?”\n\nRoderick turned his head slowly and looked at her. He had let her take\nhis hand, which she pressed tenderly between her own. He gazed at\nher for some time in silence. “Poor mother!” he said at last, in a\nportentous tone.\n\n“My own dear son!” murmured Mrs. Hudson in all the innocence of her\ntrust.\n\n“I don’t care a straw where you go! I don’t care a straw for anything!”\n\n“Oh, my dear boy, you must not say that before all of us here--before\nMary, before Mr. Mallet!”\n\n“Mary--Mr. Mallet?” Roderick repeated, almost savagely. He released\nhimself from the clasp of his mother’s hand and turned away, leaning\nhis elbows on his knees and holding his head in his hands. There was a\nsilence; Rowland said nothing because he was watching Miss Garland. “Why\nshould I stand on ceremony with Mary and Mr. Mallet?” Roderick presently\nadded. “Mary pretends to believe I ‘m a fine fellow, and if she believes\nit as she ought to, nothing I can say will alter her opinion. Mallet\nknows I ‘m a hopeless humbug; so I need n’t mince my words with him.”\n\n“Ah, my dear, don’t use such dreadful language!” said Mrs. Hudson. “Are\nn’t we all devoted to you, and proud of you, and waiting only to hear\nwhat you want, so that we may do it?”\n\nRoderick got up, and began to walk about the room; he was evidently in a\nrestless, reckless, profoundly demoralized condition. Rowland felt that\nit was literally true that he did not care a straw for anything, but\nhe observed with anxiety that Mrs. Hudson, who did not know on what\ndelicate ground she was treading, was disposed to chide him caressingly,\nas a mere expression of tenderness. He foresaw that she would bring down\nthe hovering thunderbolt on her head.\n\n“In God’s name,” Roderick cried, “don’t remind me of my obligations! It\n‘s intolerable to me, and I don’t believe it ‘s pleasant to Mallet.\nI know they ‘re tremendous--I know I shall never repay them. I ‘m\nbankrupt! Do you know what that means?”\n\nThe poor lady sat staring, dismayed, and Rowland angrily interfered.\n“Don’t talk such stuff to your mother!” he cried. “Don’t you see you ‘re\nfrightening her?”\n\n“Frightening her? she may as well be frightened first as last. Do I\nfrighten you, mother?” Roderick demanded.\n\n“Oh, Roderick, what do you mean?” whimpered the poor lady. “Mr. Mallet,\nwhat does he mean?”\n\n“I mean that I ‘m an angry, savage, disappointed, miserable man!”\n Roderick went on. “I mean that I can’t do a stroke of work nor think\na profitable thought! I mean that I ‘m in a state of helpless rage and\ngrief and shame! Helpless, helpless--that ‘s what it is. You can’t help\nme, poor mother--not with kisses, nor tears, nor prayers! Mary can’t\nhelp me--not for all the honor she does me, nor all the big books on art\nthat she pores over. Mallet can’t help me--not with all his money, nor\nall his good example, nor all his friendship, which I ‘m so profoundly\nwell aware of: not with it all multiplied a thousand times and repeated\nto all eternity! I thought you would help me, you and Mary; that ‘s why\nI sent for you. But you can’t, don’t think it! The sooner you give up\nthe idea the better for you. Give up being proud of me, too; there\n‘s nothing left of me to be proud of! A year ago I was a mighty fine\nfellow; but do you know what has become of me now? I have gone to the\ndevil!”\n\nThere was something in the ring of Roderick’s voice, as he uttered these\nwords, which sent them home with convincing force. He was not talking\nfor effect, or the mere sensuous pleasure of extravagant and paradoxical\nutterance, as had often enough been the case ere this; he was not\neven talking viciously or ill-humoredly. He was talking passionately,\ndesperately, and from an irresistible need to throw off the oppressive\nburden of his mother’s confidence. His cruel eloquence brought the poor\nlady to her feet, and she stood there with clasped hands, petrified\nand voiceless. Mary Garland quickly left her place, came straight to\nRoderick, and laid her hand on his arm, looking at him with all her\ntormented heart in her eyes. He made no movement to disengage himself;\nhe simply shook his head several times, in dogged negation of her\nhealing powers. Rowland had been living for the past month in such\nintolerable expectancy of disaster that now that the ice was broken, and\nthe fatal plunge taken, his foremost feeling was almost elation; but\nin a moment his orderly instincts and his natural love of superficial\nsmoothness overtook it.\n\n“I really don’t see, Roderick,” he said, “the profit of your talking in\njust this way at just this time. Don’t you see how you are making your\nmother suffer?”\n\n“Do I enjoy it myself?” cried Roderick. “Is the suffering all on your\nside and theirs? Do I look as if I were happy, and were stirring you\nup with a stick for my amusement? Here we all are in the same boat; we\nmight as well understand each other! These women must know that I ‘m not\nto be counted on. That sounds remarkably cool, no doubt, and I certainly\ndon’t deny your right to be utterly disgusted with me.”\n\n“Will you keep what you have got to say till another time,” said Mary,\n“and let me hear it alone?”\n\n“Oh, I ‘ll let you hear it as often as you please; but what ‘s the use\nof keeping it? I ‘m in the humor; it won’t keep! It ‘s a very simple\nmatter. I ‘m a failure, that ‘s all; I ‘m not a first-rate man. I ‘m\nsecond-rate, tenth-rate, anything you please. After that, it ‘s all\none!”\n\nMary Garland turned away and buried her face in her hands; but Roderick,\nstruck, apparently, in some unwonted fashion with her gesture, drew\nher towards him again, and went on in a somewhat different tone. “It ‘s\nhardly worth while we should have any private talk about this, Mary,” he\nsaid. “The thing would be comfortable for neither of us. It ‘s better,\nafter all, that it be said once for all and dismissed. There are\nthings I can’t talk to you about. Can I, at least? You are such a queer\ncreature!”\n\n“I can imagine nothing you should n’t talk to me about,” said Mary.\n\n“You are not afraid?” he demanded, sharply, looking at her.\n\nShe turned away abruptly, with lowered eyes, hesitating a moment.\n“Anything you think I should hear, I will hear,” she said. And then she\nreturned to her place at the window and took up her work.\n\n“I have had a great blow,” said Roderick. “I was a great ass, but it\ndoes n’t make the blow any easier to bear.”\n\n“Mr. Mallet, tell me what Roderick means!” said Mrs. Hudson, who had\nfound her voice, in a tone more peremptory than Rowland had ever heard\nher use.\n\n“He ought to have told you before,” said Roderick. “Really, Rowland,\nif you will allow me to say so, you ought! You could have given a much\nbetter account of all this than I myself; better, especially, in that\nit would have been more lenient to me. You ought to have let them down\ngently; it would have saved them a great deal of pain. But you always\nwant to keep things so smooth! Allow me to say that it ‘s very weak of\nyou.”\n\n“I hereby renounce such weakness!” said Rowland.\n\n“Oh, what is it, sir; what is it?” groaned Mrs. Hudson, insistently.\n\n“It ‘s what Roderick says: he ‘s a failure!”\n\nMary Garland, on hearing this declaration, gave Rowland a single glance\nand then rose, laid down her work, and walked rapidly out of the room.\nMrs. Hudson tossed her head and timidly bristled. “This from you, Mr.\nMallet!” she said with an injured air which Rowland found harrowing.\n\nBut Roderick, most characteristically, did not in the least resent his\nfriend’s assertion; he sent him, on the contrary, one of those large,\nclear looks of his, which seemed to express a stoical pleasure in\nRowland’s frankness, and which set his companion, then and there,\nwondering again, as he had so often done before, at the extraordinary\ncontradictions of his temperament. “My dear mother,” Roderick said, “if\nyou had had eyes that were not blinded by this sad maternal vanity, you\nwould have seen all this for yourself; you would have seen that I ‘m\nanything but prosperous.”\n\n“Is it anything about money?” cried Mrs. Hudson. “Oh, do write to Mr.\nStriker!”\n\n“Money?” said Roderick. “I have n’t a cent of money; I ‘m bankrupt!”\n\n“Oh, Mr. Mallet, how could you let him?” asked Mrs. Hudson, terribly.\n\n“Everything I have is at his service,” said Rowland, feeling ill.\n\n“Of course Mr. Mallet will help you, my son!” cried the poor lady,\neagerly.\n\n“Oh, leave Mr. Mallet alone!” said Roderick. “I have squeezed him dry;\nit ‘s not my fault, at least, if I have n’t!”\n\n“Roderick, what have you done with all your money?” his mother demanded.\n\n“Thrown it away! It was no such great amount. I have done nothing this\nwinter.”\n\n“You have done nothing?”\n\n“I have done no work! Why in the world did n’t you guess it and spare me\nall this? Could n’t you see I was idle, distracted, dissipated?”\n\n“Dissipated, my dear son?” Mrs. Hudson repeated.\n\n“That ‘s over for the present! But could n’t you see--could n’t Mary\nsee--that I was in a damnably bad way?”\n\n“I have no doubt Miss Garland saw,” said Rowland.\n\n“Mary has said nothing!” cried Mrs. Hudson.\n\n“Oh, she ‘s a fine girl!” Rowland said.\n\n“Have you done anything that will hurt poor Mary?” Mrs. Hudson asked.\n\n“I have only been thinking night and day of another woman!”\n\nMrs. Hudson dropped helplessly into her seat again. “Oh dear, dear, had\nn’t we better go home?”\n\n“Not to get out of her way!” Roderick said. “She has started on a career\nof her own, and she does n’t care a straw for me. My head was filled\nwith her; I could think of nothing else; I would have sacrificed\neverything to her--you, Mary, Mallet, my work, my fortune, my future, my\nhonor! I was in a fine state, eh? I don’t pretend to be giving you good\nnews; but I ‘m telling the simple, literal truth, so that you may know\nwhy I have gone to the dogs. She pretended to care greatly for all this,\nand to be willing to make any sacrifice in return; she had a magnificent\nchance, for she was being forced into a mercenary marriage with a man\nshe detested. She led me to believe that she would give this up, and\nbreak short off, and keep herself free and sacred and pure for me. This\nwas a great honor, and you may believe that I valued it. It turned\nmy head, and I lived only to see my happiness come to pass. She did\neverything to encourage me to hope it would; everything that her\ninfernal coquetry and falsity could suggest.”\n\n“Oh, I say, this is too much!” Rowland broke out.\n\n“Do you defend her?” Roderick cried, with a renewal of his passion. “Do\nyou pretend to say that she gave me no hopes?” He had been speaking\nwith growing bitterness, quite losing sight of his mother’s pain and\nbewilderment in the passionate joy of publishing his wrongs. Since he\nwas hurt, he must cry out; since he was in pain, he must scatter his\npain abroad. Of his never thinking of others, save as they spoke and\nmoved from his cue, as it were, this extraordinary insensibility to the\ninjurious effects of his eloquence was a capital example; the more so\nas the motive of his eloquence was never an appeal for sympathy or\ncompassion, things to which he seemed perfectly indifferent and of which\nhe could make no use. The great and characteristic point with him was\nthe perfect absoluteness of his own emotions and experience. He never\nsaw himself as part of a whole; only as the clear-cut, sharp-edged,\nisolated individual, rejoicing or raging, as the case might be, but\nneeding in any case absolutely to affirm himself. All this, to Rowland,\nwas ancient history, but his perception of it stirred within him afresh,\nat the sight of Roderick’s sense of having been betrayed. That he,\nunder the circumstances, should not in fairness be the first to lodge a\ncomplaint of betrayal was a point to which, at his leisure, Rowland was\nof course capable of rendering impartial justice; but Roderick’s\npresent desperation was so peremptory that it imposed itself on one’s\nsympathies. “Do you pretend to say,” he went on, “that she did n’t lead\nme along to the very edge of fulfillment and stupefy me with all that\nshe suffered me to believe, all that she sacredly promised? It amused\nher to do it, and she knew perfectly well what she really meant. She\nnever meant to be sincere; she never dreamed she could be. She ‘s a\nravenous flirt, and why a flirt is a flirt is more than I can tell you.\nI can’t understand playing with those matters; for me they ‘re serious,\nwhether I take them up or lay them down. I don’t see what ‘s in your\nhead, Rowland, to attempt to defend Miss Light; you were the first to\ncry out against her! You told me she was dangerous, and I pooh-poohed\nyou. You were right; you ‘re always right. She ‘s as cold and false and\nheartless as she ‘s beautiful, and she has sold her heartless beauty to\nthe highest bidder. I hope he knows what he gets!”\n\n“Oh, my son,” cried Mrs. Hudson, plaintively, “how could you ever care\nfor such a dreadful creature?”\n\n“It would take long to tell you, dear mother!”\n\nRowland’s lately-deepened sympathy and compassion for Christina was\nstill throbbing in his mind, and he felt that, in loyalty to it, he\nmust say a word for her. “You believed in her too much at first,” he\ndeclared, “and you believe in her too little now.”\n\nRoderick looked at him with eyes almost lurid, beneath lowering brows.\n“She is an angel, then, after all?--that ‘s what you want to prove!”\n he cried. “That ‘s consoling for me, who have lost her! You ‘re always\nright, I say; but, dear friend, in mercy, be wrong for once!”\n\n“Oh yes, Mr. Mallet, be merciful!” said Mrs. Hudson, in a tone which,\nfor all its gentleness, made Rowland stare. The poor fellow’s stare\ncovered a great deal of concentrated wonder and apprehension--a\npresentiment of what a small, sweet, feeble, elderly lady might be\ncapable of, in the way of suddenly generated animosity. There was no\nspace in Mrs. Hudson’s tiny maternal mind for complications of feeling,\nand one emotion existed only by turning another over flat and perching\non top of it. She was evidently not following Roderick at all in his\ndusky aberrations. Sitting without, in dismay, she only saw that all was\ndarkness and trouble, and as Roderick’s glory had now quite outstripped\nher powers of imagination and urged him beyond her jurisdiction, so that\nhe had become a thing too precious and sacred for blame, she found it\ninfinitely comfortable to lay the burden of their common affliction upon\nRowland’s broad shoulders. Had he not promised to make them all rich and\nhappy? And this was the end of it! Rowland felt as if his trials were,\nin a sense, only beginning. “Had n’t you better forget all this, my\ndear?” Mrs. Hudson said. “Had n’t you better just quietly attend to your\nwork?”\n\n“Work, madame?” cried Roderick. “My work ‘s over. I can’t work--I have\nn’t worked all winter. If I were fit for anything, this sentimental\ncollapse would have been just the thing to cure me of my apathy and\nbreak the spell of my idleness. But there ‘s a perfect vacuum here!” And\nhe tapped his forehead. “It ‘s bigger than ever; it grows bigger every\nhour!”\n\n“I ‘m sure you have made a beautiful likeness of your poor little\nmother,” said Mrs. Hudson, coaxingly.\n\n“I had done nothing before, and I have done nothing since! I quarreled\nwith an excellent man, the other day, from mere exasperation of my\nnerves, and threw away five thousand dollars!”\n\n“Threw away--five thousand dollars!” Roderick had been wandering among\nformidable abstractions and allusions too dark to penetrate. But here\nwas a concrete fact, lucidly stated, and poor Mrs. Hudson, for a moment,\nlooked it in the face. She repeated her son’s words a third time with a\ngasping murmur, and then, suddenly, she burst into tears. Roderick\nwent to her, sat down beside her, put his arm round her, fixed his eyes\ncoldly on the floor, and waited for her to weep herself out. She leaned\nher head on his shoulder and sobbed broken-heartedly. She said not a\nword, she made no attempt to scold; but the desolation of her tears was\noverwhelming. It lasted some time--too long for Rowland’s courage. He\nhad stood silent, wishing simply to appear very respectful; but the\nelation that was mentioned a while since had utterly ebbed, and he found\nhis situation intolerable. He walked away--not, perhaps, on tiptoe, but\nwith a total absence of bravado in his tread.\n\nThe next day, while he was at home, the servant brought him the card of\na visitor. He read with surprise the name of Mrs. Hudson, and hurried\nforward to meet her. He found her in his sitting-room, leaning on the\narm of her son and looking very pale, her eyes red with weeping, and her\nlips tightly compressed. Her advent puzzled him, and it was not for\nsome time that he began to understand the motive of it. Roderick’s\ncountenance threw no light upon it; but Roderick’s countenance, full of\nlight as it was, in a way, itself, had never thrown light upon anything.\nHe had not been in Rowland’s rooms for several weeks, and he immediately\nbegan to look at those of his own works that adorned them. He lost\nhimself in silent contemplation. Mrs. Hudson had evidently armed herself\nwith dignity, and, so far as she might, she meant to be impressive.\nHer success may be measured by the fact that Rowland’s whole attention\ncentred in the fear of seeing her begin to weep. She told him that she\nhad come to him for practical advice; she begged to remind him that she\nwas a stranger in the land. Where were they to go, please? what were\nthey to do? Rowland glanced at Roderick, but Roderick had his back\nturned and was gazing at his Adam with the intensity with which he might\nhave examined Michael Angelo’s Moses.\n\n“Roderick says he does n’t know, he does n’t care,” Mrs. Hudson said;\n“he leaves it entirely to you.”\n\nMany another man, in Rowland’s place, would have greeted this\ninformation with an irate and sarcastic laugh, and told his visitors\nthat he thanked them infinitely for their confidence, but that, really,\nas things stood now, they must settle these matters between themselves;\nmany another man might have so demeaned himself, even if, like Rowland,\nhe had been in love with Mary Garland and pressingly conscious that\nher destiny was also part of the question. But Rowland swallowed all\nhilarity and all sarcasm, and let himself seriously consider Mrs.\nHudson’s petition. His wits, however, were but indifferently at his\ncommand; they were dulled by his sense of the inexpressible change in\nMrs. Hudson’s attitude. Her visit was evidently intended as a formal\nreminder of the responsiblities Rowland had worn so lightly. Mrs. Hudson\nwas doubtless too sincerely humble a person to suppose that if he had\nbeen recreant to his vows of vigilance and tenderness, her still, small\npresence would operate as a chastisement. But by some diminutive logical\nprocess of her own she had convinced herself that she had been weakly\ntrustful, and that she had suffered Rowland to think too meanly, not\nonly of her understanding, but of her social consequence. A visit in\nher best gown would have an admonitory effect as regards both of these\nattributes; it would cancel some favors received, and show him that she\nwas no such fool! These were the reflections of a very shy woman,\nwho, determining for once in her life to hold up her head, was perhaps\ncarrying it a trifle extravagantly.\n\n“You know we have very little money to spend,” she said, as Rowland\nremained silent. “Roderick tells me that he has debts and nothing at all\nto pay them with. He says I must write to Mr. Striker to sell my house\nfor what it will bring, and send me out the money. When the money comes\nI must give it to him. I ‘m sure I don’t know; I never heard of anything\nso dreadful! My house is all I have. But that is all Roderick will say.\nWe must be very economical.”\n\nBefore this speech was finished Mrs. Hudson’s voice had begun to quaver\nsoftly, and her face, which had no capacity for the expression of\nsuperior wisdom, to look as humbly appealing as before. Rowland turned\nto Roderick and spoke like a school-master. “Come away from those\nstatues, and sit down here and listen to me!”\n\nRoderick started, but obeyed with the most graceful docility.\n\n“What do you propose to your mother to do?” Rowland asked.\n\n“Propose?” said Roderick, absently. “Oh, I propose nothing.”\n\nThe tone, the glance, the gesture with which this was said were horribly\nirritating (though obviously without the slightest intention of being\nso), and for an instant an imprecation rose to Rowland’s lips. But he\nchecked it, and he was afterwards glad he had done so. “You must do\nsomething,” he said. “Choose, select, decide!”\n\n“My dear Rowland, how you talk!” Roderick cried. “The very point of the\nmatter is that I can’t do anything. I will do as I ‘m told, but I don’t\ncall that doing. We must leave Rome, I suppose, though I don’t see why.\nWe have got no money, and you have to pay money on the railroads.”\n\nMrs. Hudson surreptitiously wrung her hands. “Listen to him, please!”\n she cried. “Not leave Rome, when we have staid here later than any\nChristians ever did before! It ‘s this dreadful place that has made us\nso unhappy.”\n\n“That ‘s very true,” said Roderick, serenely. “If I had not come to\nRome, I would n’t have risen, and if I had not risen, I should n’t have\nfallen.”\n\n“Fallen--fallen!” murmured Mrs. Hudson. “Just hear him!”\n\n“I will do anything you say, Rowland,” Roderick added. “I will do\nanything you want. I have not been unkind to my mother--have I, mother?\nI was unkind yesterday, without meaning it; for after all, all that had\nto be said. Murder will out, and my low spirits can’t be hidden. But we\ntalked it over and made it up, did n’t we? It seemed to me we did.\nLet Rowland decide it, mother; whatever he suggests will be the right\nthing.” And Roderick, who had hardly removed his eyes from the statues,\ngot up again and went back to look at them.\n\nMrs. Hudson fixed her eyes upon the floor in silence. There was not\na trace in Roderick’s face, or in his voice, of the bitterness of his\nemotion of the day before, and not a hint of his having the lightest\nweight upon his conscience. He looked at Rowland with his frank,\nluminous eye as if there had never been a difference of opinion between\nthem; as if each had ever been for both, unalterably, and both for each.\n\nRowland had received a few days before a letter from a lady of his\nacquaintance, a worthy Scotswoman domiciled in a villa upon one of the\nolive-covered hills near Florence. She held her apartment in the villa\nupon a long lease, and she enjoyed for a sum not worth mentioning the\npossession of an extraordinary number of noble, stone-floored rooms,\nwith ceilings vaulted and frescoed, and barred windows commanding the\nloveliest view in the world. She was a needy and thrifty spinster, who\nnever hesitated to declare that the lovely view was all very well, but\nthat for her own part she lived in the villa for cheapness, and that\nif she had a clear three hundred pounds a year she would go and really\nenjoy life near her sister, a baronet’s lady, at Glasgow. She was now\nproposing to make a visit to that exhilarating city, and she desired to\nturn an honest penny by sub-letting for a few weeks her historic Italian\nchambers. The terms on which she occupied them enabled her to ask a rent\nalmost jocosely small, and she begged Rowland to do what she called a\nlittle genteel advertising for her. Would he say a good word for her\nrooms to his numerous friends, as they left Rome? He said a good word\nfor them now to Mrs. Hudson, and told her in dollars and cents how cheap\na summer’s lodging she might secure. He dwelt upon the fact that she\nwould strike a truce with tables-d’hote and have a cook of her own,\namenable possibly to instruction in the Northampton mysteries. He\nhad touched a tender chord; Mrs. Hudson became almost cheerful. Her\nsentiments upon the table-d’hote system and upon foreign household\nhabits generally were remarkable, and, if we had space for it, would\nrepay analysis; and the idea of reclaiming a lost soul to the Puritanic\ncanons of cookery quite lightened the burden of her depression. While\nRowland set forth his case Roderick was slowly walking round the\nmagnificent Adam, with his hands in his pockets. Rowland waited for him\nto manifest an interest in their discussion, but the statue seemed to\nfascinate him and he remained calmly heedless. Rowland was a practical\nman; he possessed conspicuously what is called the sense of detail. He\nentered into Mrs. Hudson’s position minutely, and told her exactly why\nit seemed good that she should remove immediately to the Florentine\nvilla. She received his advice with great frigidity, looking hard at the\nfloor and sighing, like a person well on her guard against an insidious\noptimism. But she had nothing better to propose, and Rowland received\nher permission to write to his friend that he had let the rooms.\n\nRoderick assented to this decision without either sighs or smiles. “A\nFlorentine villa is a good thing!” he said. “I am at your service.”\n\n“I ‘m sure I hope you ‘ll get better there,” moaned his mother,\ngathering her shawl together.\n\nRoderick laid one hand on her arm and with the other pointed to\nRowland’s statues. “Better or worse, remember this: I did those things!”\n he said.\n\nMrs. Hudson gazed at them vaguely, and Rowland said, “Remember it\nyourself!”\n\n“They are horribly good!” said Roderick.\n\nRowland solemnly shrugged his shoulders; it seemed to him that he\nhad nothing more to say. But as the others were going, a last light\npulsation of the sense of undischarged duty led him to address to\nRoderick a few words of parting advice. “You ‘ll find the Villa\nPandolfini very delightful, very comfortable,” he said. “You ought to\nbe very contented there. Whether you work or whether you loaf, it ‘s a\nplace for an artist to be happy in. I hope you will work.”\n\n“I hope I may!” said Roderick with a magnificent smile.\n\n“When we meet again, have something to show me.”\n\n“When we meet again? Where the deuce are you going?” Roderick demanded.\n\n“Oh, I hardly know; over the Alps.”\n\n“Over the Alps! You ‘re going to leave me?” Roderick cried.\n\nRowland had most distinctly meant to leave him, but his resolution\nimmediately wavered. He glanced at Mrs. Hudson and saw that her eyebrows\nwere lifted and her lips parted in soft irony. She seemed to accuse him\nof a craven shirking of trouble, to demand of him to repair his\ncruel havoc in her life by a solemn renewal of zeal. But Roderick’s\nexpectations were the oddest! Such as they were, Rowland asked himself\nwhy he should n’t make a bargain with them. “You desire me to go with\nyou?” he asked.\n\n“If you don’t go, I won’t--that ‘s all! How in the world shall I get\nthrough the summer without you?”\n\n“How will you get through it with me? That ‘s the question.”\n\n“I don’t pretend to say; the future is a dead blank. But without you it\n‘s not a blank--it ‘s certain damnation!”\n\n“Mercy, mercy!” murmured Mrs. Hudson.\n\nRowland made an effort to stand firm, and for a moment succeeded. “If I\ngo with you, will you try to work?”\n\nRoderick, up to this moment, had been looking as unperturbed as if the\ndeep agitation of the day before were a thing of the remote past. But at\nthese words his face changed formidably; he flushed and scowled, and all\nhis passion returned. “Try to work!” he cried. “Try--try! work--work! In\nGod’s name don’t talk that way, or you ‘ll drive me mad! Do you suppose\nI ‘m trying not to work? Do you suppose I stand rotting here for the fun\nof it? Don’t you suppose I would try to work for myself before I tried\nfor you?”\n\n“Mr. Mallet,” cried Mrs. Hudson, piteously, “will you leave me alone\nwith this?”\n\nRowland turned to her and informed her, gently, that he would go with\nher to Florence. After he had so pledged himself he thought not at all\nof the pain of his position as mediator between the mother’s resentful\ngrief and the son’s incurable weakness; he drank deep, only, of the\nsatisfaction of not separating from Mary Garland. If the future was a\nblank to Roderick, it was hardly less so to himself. He had at moments\na lively foreboding of impending calamity. He paid it no especial\ndeference, but it made him feel indisposed to take the future into his\naccount. When, on his going to take leave of Madame Grandoni, this lady\nasked at what time he would come back to Rome, he answered that he was\ncoming back either never or forever. When she asked him what he meant,\nhe said he really could n’t tell her, and parted from her with much\ngenuine emotion; the more so, doubtless, that she blessed him in a quite\nloving, maternal fashion, and told him she honestly believed him to be\nthe best fellow in the world.\n\nThe Villa Pandolfini stood directly upon a small grass-grown piazza,\non the top of a hill which sloped straight from one of the gates of\nFlorence. It offered to the outer world a long, rather low facade,\ncolored a dull, dark yellow, and pierced with windows of various sizes,\nno one of which, save those on the ground floor, was on the same level\nwith any other. Within, it had a great, cool, gray cortile, with high,\nlight arches around it, heavily-corniced doors, of majestic altitude,\nopening out of it, and a beautiful mediaeval well on one side of it.\nMrs. Hudson’s rooms opened into a small garden supported on immense\nsubstructions, which were planted on the farther side of the hill, as\nit sloped steeply away. This garden was a charming place. Its south wall\nwas curtained with a dense orange vine, a dozen fig-trees offered you\ntheir large-leaved shade, and over the low parapet the soft, grave\nTuscan landscape kept you company. The rooms themselves were as high as\nchapels and as cool as royal sepulchres. Silence, peace, and security\nseemed to abide in the ancient house and make it an ideal refuge for\naching hearts. Mrs. Hudson had a stunted, brown-faced Maddalena, who\nwore a crimson handkerchief passed over her coarse, black locks and tied\nunder her sharp, pertinacious chin, and a smile which was as brilliant\nas a prolonged flash of lightning. She smiled at everything in life,\nespecially the things she did n’t like and which kept her talent for\nmendacity in healthy exercise. A glance, a word, a motion was sufficient\nto make her show her teeth at you like a cheerful she-wolf. This\ninexpugnable smile constituted her whole vocabulary in her dealings with\nher melancholy mistress, to whom she had been bequeathed by the late\noccupant of the apartment, and who, to Rowland’s satisfaction,\npromised to be diverted from her maternal sorrows by the still\ndeeper perplexities of Maddalena’s theory of roasting, sweeping, and\nbed-making.\n\nRowland took rooms at a villa a trifle nearer Florence, whence in\nthe summer mornings he had five minutes’ walk in the sharp, black,\nshadow-strip projected by winding, flower-topped walls, to join his\nfriends. The life at the Villa Pandolfini, when it had fairly defined\nitself, was tranquil and monotonous, but it might have borrowed from\nexquisite circumstance an absorbing charm. If a sensible shadow rested\nupon it, this was because it had an inherent vice; it was feigning a\nrepose which it very scantily felt. Roderick had lost no time in giving\nthe full measure of his uncompromising chagrin, and as he was the\ncentral figure of the little group, as he held its heart-strings all in\nhis own hand, it reflected faithfully the eclipse of his own genius. No\none had ventured upon the cheerful commonplace of saying that the change\nof air and of scene would restore his spirits; this would have had,\nunder the circumstances, altogether too silly a sound. The change in\nquestion had done nothing of the sort, and his companions had, at least,\nthe comfort of their perspicacity. An essential spring had dried up\nwithin him, and there was no visible spiritual law for making it flow\nagain. He was rarely violent, he expressed little of the irritation and\nennui that he must have constantly felt; it was as if he believed that\na spiritual miracle for his redemption was just barely possible, and was\ntherefore worth waiting for. The most that one could do, however, was\nto wait grimly and doggedly, suppressing an imprecation as, from time to\ntime, one looked at one’s watch. An attitude of positive urbanity toward\nlife was not to be expected; it was doing one’s duty to hold one’s\ntongue and keep one’s hands off one’s own windpipe, and other people’s.\nRoderick had long silences, fits of profound lethargy, almost of\nstupefaction. He used to sit in the garden by the hour, with his head\nthrown back, his legs outstretched, his hands in his pockets, and his\neyes fastened upon the blinding summer sky. He would gather a dozen\nbooks about him, tumble them out on the ground, take one into his lap,\nand leave it with the pages unturned. These moods would alternate with\nhours of extreme restlessness, during which he mysteriously absented\nhimself. He bore the heat of the Italian summer like a salamander, and\nused to start off at high noon for long walks over the hills. He often\nwent down into Florence, rambled through her close, dim streets, and\nlounged away mornings in the churches and galleries. On many of these\noccasions Rowland bore him company, for they were the times when he\nwas most like his former self. Before Michael Angelo’s statues and the\npictures of the early Tuscans, he quite forgot his own infelicities, and\npicked up the thread of his old aesthetic loquacity. He had a particular\nfondness for Andrea del Sarto, and affirmed that if he had been a\npainter he would have taken the author of the Madonna del Sacco for his\nmodel. He found in Florence some of his Roman friends, and went down on\ncertain evenings to meet them. More than once he asked Mary Garland to\ngo with him into town, and showed her the things he most cared for. He\nhad some modeling clay brought up to the villa and deposited in a room\nsuitable for his work; but when this had been done he turned the key in\nthe door and the clay never was touched. His eye was heavy and his hand\ncold, and his mother put up a secret prayer that he might be induced\nto see a doctor. But on a certain occasion, when her prayer became\narticulate, he had a great outburst of anger and begged her to know,\nonce for all, that his health was better than it had ever been. On\nthe whole, and most of the time, he was a sad spectacle; he looked so\nhopelessly idle. If he was not querulous and bitter, it was because he\nhad taken an extraordinary vow not to be; a vow heroic, for him, a vow\nwhich those who knew him well had the tenderness to appreciate. Talking\nwith him was like skating on thin ice, and his companions had a constant\nmental vision of spots designated “dangerous.”\n\nThis was a difficult time for Rowland; he said to himself that he would\nendure it to the end, but that it must be his last adventure of the\nkind. Mrs. Hudson divided her time between looking askance at her son,\nwith her hands tightly clasped about her pocket-handkerchief, as if she\nwere wringing it dry of the last hour’s tears, and turning her eyes\nmuch more directly upon Rowland, in the mutest, the feeblest, the most\nintolerable reproachfulness. She never phrased her accusations, but he\nfelt that in the unillumined void of the poor lady’s mind they loomed\nup like vaguely-outlined monsters. Her demeanor caused him the acutest\nsuffering, and if, at the outset of his enterprise, he had seen, how\ndimly soever, one of those plaintive eye-beams in the opposite scale,\nthe brilliancy of Roderick’s promises would have counted for little.\nThey made their way to the softest spot in his conscience and kept it\nchronically aching. If Mrs. Hudson had been loquacious and vulgar, he\nwould have borne even a less valid persecution with greater fortitude.\nBut somehow, neat and noiseless and dismally lady-like, as she sat\nthere, keeping her grievance green with her soft-dropping tears, her\ndispleasure conveyed an overwhelming imputation of brutality. He felt\nlike a reckless trustee who has speculated with the widow’s mite, and is\nhaunted with the reflection of ruin that he sees in her tearful eyes. He\ndid everything conceivable to be polite to Mrs. Hudson, and to treat her\nwith distinguished deference. Perhaps his exasperated nerves made him\novershoot the mark, and rendered his civilities a trifle peremptory. She\nseemed capable of believing that he was trying to make a fool of her;\nshe would have thought him cruelly recreant if he had suddenly\ndeparted in desperation, and yet she gave him no visible credit for his\nconstancy. Women are said by some authorities to be cruel; I don’t know\nhow true this is, but it may at least be pertinent to remark that Mrs.\nHudson was very much of a woman. It often seemed to Rowland that he\nhad too decidedly forfeited his freedom, and that there was something\npositively grotesque in a man of his age and circumstances living in\nsuch a moral bondage.\n\nBut Mary Garland had helped him before, and she helped him now--helped\nhim not less than he had assured himself she would when he found himself\ndrifting to Florence. Yet her help was rendered in the same unconscious,\nunacknowledged fashion as before; there was no explicit change in their\nrelations. After that distressing scene in Rome which had immediately\npreceded their departure, it was of course impossible that there should\nnot be on Miss Garland’s part some frankness of allusion to Roderick’s\nsad condition. She had been present, the reader will remember, during\nonly half of his unsparing confession, and Rowland had not seen her\nconfronted with any absolute proof of Roderick’s passion for Christina\nLight. But he knew that she knew far too much for her happiness;\nRoderick had told him, shortly after their settlement at the Villa\nPandolfini, that he had had a “tremendous talk” with his cousin. Rowland\nasked no questions about it; he preferred not to know what had passed\nbetween them. If their interview had been purely painful, he wished\nto ignore it for Miss Garland’s sake; and if it had sown the seeds of\nreconciliation, he wished to close his eyes to it for his own--for the\nsake of that unshaped idea, forever dismissed and yet forever present,\nwhich hovered in the background of his consciousness, with a hanging\nhead, as it were, and yet an unshamed glance, and whose lightest motions\nwere an effectual bribe to patience. Was the engagement broken? Rowland\nwondered, yet without asking. But it hardly mattered, for if, as was\nmore than probable, Miss Garland had peremptorily released her cousin,\nher own heart had by no means recovered its liberty. It was very certain\nto Rowland’s mind that if she had given him up she had by no means\nceased to care for him passionately, and that, to exhaust her charity\nfor his weaknesses, Roderick would have, as the phrase is, a long row to\nhoe. She spoke of Roderick as she might have done of a person suffering\nfrom a serious malady which demanded much tenderness; but if Rowland\nhad found it possible to accuse her of dishonesty he would have said now\nthat she believed appreciably less than she pretended to in her victim’s\nbeing an involuntary patient. There are women whose love is care-taking\nand patronizing, and who rather prefer a weak man because he gives them\na comfortable sense of strength. It did not in the least please Rowland\nto believe that Mary Garland was one of these; for he held that such\nwomen were only males in petticoats, and he was convinced that Miss\nGarland’s heart was constructed after the most perfect feminine model.\nThat she was a very different woman from Christina Light did not at all\nprove that she was less a woman, and if the Princess Casamassima had\ngone up into a high place to publish her disrelish of a man who lacked\nthe virile will, it was very certain that Mary Garland was not a person\nto put up, at any point, with what might be called the princess’s\nleavings. It was Christina’s constant practice to remind you of the\ncomplexity of her character, of the subtlety of her mind, of her\ntroublous faculty of seeing everything in a dozen different lights. Mary\nGarland had never pretended not to be simple; but Rowland had a theory\nthat she had really a more multitudinous sense of human things, a more\ndelicate imagination, and a finer instinct of character. She did you the\nhonors of her mind with a grace far less regal, but was not that faculty\nof quite as remarkable an adjustment? If in poor Christina’s strangely\ncommingled nature there was circle within circle, and depth beneath\ndepth, it was to be believed that Mary Garland, though she did not amuse\nherself with dropping stones into her soul, and waiting to hear them\nfall, laid quite as many sources of spiritual life under contribution.\nShe had believed Roderick was a fine fellow when she bade him farewell\nbeneath the Northampton elms, and this belief, to her young, strenuous,\nconcentrated imagination, had meant many things. If it was to grow cold,\nit would be because disenchantment had become total and won the battle\nat each successive point.\n\nMiss Garland had even in her face and carriage something of the\npreoccupied and wearied look of a person who is watching at a sick-bed;\nRoderick’s broken fortunes, his dead ambitions, were a cruel burden to\nthe heart of a girl who had believed that he possessed “genius,” and\nsupposed that genius was to one’s spiritual economy what full pockets\nwere to one’s domestic. And yet, with her, Rowland never felt, as\nwith Mrs. Hudson, that undercurrent of reproach and bitterness toward\nhimself, that impertinent implication that he had defrauded her of\nhappiness. Was this justice, in Miss Garland, or was it mercy? The\nanswer would have been difficult, for she had almost let Rowland feel\nbefore leaving Rome that she liked him well enough to forgive him an\ninjury. It was partly, Rowland fancied, that there were occasional\nlapses, deep and sweet, in her sense of injury. When, on arriving\nat Florence, she saw the place Rowland had brought them to in their\ntrouble, she had given him a look and said a few words to him that\nhad seemed not only a remission of guilt but a positive reward.\nThis happened in the court of the villa--the large gray quadrangle,\noverstretched, from edge to edge of the red-tiled roof, by the soft\nItalian sky. Mary had felt on the spot the sovereign charm of the\nplace; it was reflected in her deeply intelligent glance, and Rowland\nimmediately accused himself of not having done the villa justice. Miss\nGarland took a mighty fancy to Florence, and used to look down wistfully\nat the towered city from the windows and garden. Roderick having now no\npretext for not being her cicerone, Rowland was no longer at liberty, as\nhe had been in Rome, to propose frequent excursions to her. Roderick’s\nown invitations, however, were not frequent, and Rowland more than once\nventured to introduce her to a gallery or a church. These expeditions\nwere not so blissful, to his sense, as the rambles they had taken\ntogether in Rome, for his companion only half surrendered herself to her\nenjoyment, and seemed to have but a divided attention at her command.\nOften, when she had begun with looking intently at a picture, her\nsilence, after an interval, made him turn and glance at her. He usually\nfound that if she was looking at the picture still, she was not seeing\nit. Her eyes were fixed, but her thoughts were wandering, and an image\nmore vivid than any that Raphael or Titian had drawn had superposed\nitself upon the canvas. She asked fewer questions than before, and\nseemed to have lost heart for consulting guide-books and encyclopaedias.\nFrom time to time, however, she uttered a deep, full murmur of\ngratification. Florence in midsummer was perfectly void of travelers,\nand the dense little city gave forth its aesthetic aroma with a larger\nfrankness, as the nightingale sings when the listeners have departed.\nThe churches were deliciously cool, but the gray streets were stifling,\nand the great, dove-tailed polygons of pavement as hot to the tread as\nmolten lava. Rowland, who suffered from intense heat, would have found\nall this uncomfortable in solitude; but Florence had never charmed him\nso completely as during these midsummer strolls with his preoccupied\ncompanion. One evening they had arranged to go on the morrow to the\nAcademy. Miss Garland kept her appointment, but as soon as she appeared,\nRowland saw that something painful had befallen her. She was doing her\nbest to look at her ease, but her face bore the marks of tears. Rowland\ntold her that he was afraid she was ill, and that if she preferred to\ngive up the visit to Florence he would submit with what grace he might.\nShe hesitated a moment, and then said she preferred to adhere to their\nplan. “I am not well,” she presently added, “but it ‘s a moral malady,\nand in such cases I consider your company beneficial.”\n\n“But if I am to be your doctor,” said Rowland, “you must tell me how\nyour illness began.”\n\n“I can tell you very little. It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to\nme, for the first time in her life. And now I am already better!”\n\nI mention this incident because it confirmed an impression of Rowland’s\nfrom which he had derived a certain consolation. He knew that Mrs.\nHudson considered her son’s ill-regulated passion for Christina Light a\nvery regrettable affair, but he suspected that her manifest compassion\nhad been all for Roderick, and not in the least for Mary Garland. She\nwas fond of the young girl, but she had valued her primarily, during the\nlast two years, as a kind of assistant priestess at Roderick’s shrine.\nRoderick had honored her by asking her to become his wife, but that poor\nMary had any rights in consequence Mrs. Hudson was quite incapable\nof perceiving. Her sentiment on the subject was of course not very\nvigorously formulated, but she was unprepared to admit that Miss Garland\nhad any ground for complaint. Roderick was very unhappy; that was\nenough, and Mary’s duty was to join her patience and her prayers to\nthose of his doting mother. Roderick might fall in love with whom he\npleased; no doubt that women trained in the mysterious Roman arts were\nonly too proud and too happy to make it easy for him; and it was very\npresuming in poor, plain Mary to feel any personal resentment. Mrs.\nHudson’s philosophy was of too narrow a scope to suggest that a mother\nmay forgive where a mistress cannot, and she thought herself greatly\naggrieved that Miss Garland was not so disinterested as herself. She was\nready to drop dead in Roderick’s service, and she was quite capable\nof seeing her companion falter and grow faint, without a tremor of\ncompassion. Mary, apparently, had given some intimation of her belief\nthat if constancy is the flower of devotion, reciprocity is the\nguarantee of constancy, and Mrs. Hudson had rebuked her failing faith\nand called it cruelty. That Miss Garland had found it hard to reason\nwith Mrs. Hudson, that she suffered deeply from the elder lady’s\nsoftly bitter imputations, and that, in short, he had companionship\nin misfortune--all this made Rowland find a certain luxury in his\ndiscomfort.\n\nThe party at Villa Pandolfini used to sit in the garden in the evenings,\nwhich Rowland almost always spent with them. Their entertainment was in\nthe heavily perfumed air, in the dim, far starlight, in the crenelated\ntower of a neighboring villa, which loomed vaguely above them in the\nwarm darkness, and in such conversation as depressing reflections\nallowed. Roderick, clad always in white, roamed about like a restless\nghost, silent for the most part, but making from time to time a brief\nobservation, characterized by the most fantastic cynicism. Roderick’s\ncontributions to the conversation were indeed always so fantastic that,\nthough half the time they wearied him unspeakably, Rowland made an\neffort to treat them humorously. With Rowland alone Roderick talked a\ngreat deal more; often about things related to his own work, or about\nartistic and aesthetic matters in general. He talked as well as ever,\nor even better; but his talk always ended in a torrent of groans and\ncurses. When this current set in, Rowland straightway turned his back\nor stopped his ears, and Roderick now witnessed these movements with\nperfect indifference. When the latter was absent from the star-lit\ncircle in the garden, as often happened, Rowland knew nothing of his\nwhereabouts; he supposed him to be in Florence, but he never learned\nwhat he did there. All this was not enlivening, but with an even,\nmuffled tread the days followed each other, and brought the month\nof August to a close. One particular evening at this time was most\nenchanting; there was a perfect moon, looking so extraordinarily large\nthat it made everything its light fell upon seem small; the heat was\ntempered by a soft west wind, and the wind was laden with the odors of\nthe early harvest. The hills, the vale of the Arno, the shrunken river,\nthe domes of Florence, were vaguely effaced by the dense moonshine; they\nlooked as if they were melting out of sight like an exorcised vision.\nRowland had found the two ladies alone at the villa, and he had sat with\nthem for an hour. He felt absolutely hushed by the solemn splendor of\nthe scene, but he had risked the remark that, whatever life might yet\nhave in store for either of them, this was a night that they would never\nforget.\n\n“It ‘s a night to remember on one’s death-bed!” Miss Garland exclaimed.\n\n“Oh, Mary, how can you!” murmured Mrs. Hudson, to whom this savored\nof profanity, and to whose shrinking sense, indeed, the accumulated\nloveliness of the night seemed to have something shameless and defiant.\n\nThey were silent after this, for some time, but at last Rowland\naddressed certain idle words to Miss Garland. She made no reply, and he\nturned to look at her. She was sitting motionless, with her head pressed\nto Mrs. Hudson’s shoulder, and the latter lady was gazing at him through\nthe silvered dusk with a look which gave a sort of spectral solemnity to\nthe sad, weak meaning of her eyes. She had the air, for the moment, of\na little old malevolent fairy. Miss Garland, Rowland perceived in an\ninstant, was not absolutely motionless; a tremor passed through her\nfigure. She was weeping, or on the point of weeping, and she could not\ntrust herself to speak. Rowland left his place and wandered to another\npart of the garden, wondering at the motive of her sudden tears. Of\nwomen’s sobs in general he had a sovereign dread, but these, somehow,\ngave him a certain pleasure. When he returned to his place Miss Garland\nhad raised her head and banished her tears. She came away from Mrs.\nHudson, and they stood for a short time leaning against the parapet.\n\n“It seems to you very strange, I suppose,” said Rowland, “that there\nshould be any trouble in such a world as this.”\n\n“I used to think,” she answered, “that if any trouble came to me I would\nbear it like a stoic. But that was at home, where things don’t speak to\nus of enjoyment as they do here. Here it is such a mixture; one does n’t\nknow what to choose, what to believe. Beauty stands there--beauty such\nas this night and this place, and all this sad, strange summer, have\nbeen so full of--and it penetrates to one’s soul and lodges there, and\nkeeps saying that man was not made to suffer, but to enjoy. This place\nhas undermined my stoicism, but--shall I tell you? I feel as if I were\nsaying something sinful--I love it!”\n\n“If it is sinful, I absolve you,” said Rowland, “in so far as I have\npower. We are made, I suppose, both to suffer and to enjoy. As you say,\nit ‘s a mixture. Just now and here, it seems a peculiarly strange one.\nBut we must take things in turn.”\n\nHis words had a singular aptness, for he had hardly uttered them when\nRoderick came out from the house, evidently in his darkest mood. He\nstood for a moment gazing hard at the view.\n\n“It ‘s a very beautiful night, my son,” said his mother, going to him\ntimidly, and touching his arm.\n\nHe passed his hand through his hair and let it stay there, clasping\nhis thick locks. “Beautiful?” he cried; “of course it ‘s beautiful!\nEverything is beautiful; everything is insolent, defiant, atrocious with\nbeauty. Nothing is ugly but me--me and my poor dead brain!”\n\n“Oh, my dearest son,” pleaded poor Mrs. Hudson, “don’t you feel any\nbetter?”\n\nRoderick made no immediate answer; but at last he spoke in a different\nvoice. “I came expressly to tell you that you need n’t trouble\nyourselves any longer to wait for something to turn up. Nothing will\nturn up! It ‘s all over! I said when I came here I would give it a\nchance. I have given it a chance. Have n’t I, eh? Have n’t I, Rowland?\nIt ‘s no use; the thing ‘s a failure! Do with me now what you please. I\nrecommend you to set me up there at the end of the garden and shoot me.”\n\n“I feel strongly inclined,” said Rowland gravely, “to go and get my\nrevolver.”\n\n“Oh, mercy on us, what language!” cried Mrs. Hudson.\n\n“Why not?” Roderick went on. “This would be a lovely night for it, and I\nshould be a lucky fellow to be buried in this garden. But bury me alive,\nif you prefer. Take me back to Northampton.”\n\n“Roderick, will you really come?” cried his mother.\n\n“Oh yes, I ‘ll go! I might as well be there as anywhere--reverting to\nidiocy and living upon alms. I can do nothing with all this; perhaps I\nshould really like Northampton. If I ‘m to vegetate for the rest of my\ndays, I can do it there better than here.”\n\n“Oh, come home, come home,” Mrs. Hudson said, “and we shall all be safe\nand quiet and happy. My dearest son, come home with your poor mother!”\n\n“Let us go, then, and go quickly!”\n\nMrs. Hudson flung herself upon his neck for gratitude. “We ‘ll go\nto-morrow!” she cried. “The Lord is very good to me!”\n\nMary Garland said nothing to this; but she looked at Rowland, and her\neyes seemed to contain a kind of alarmed appeal. Rowland noted it with\nexultation, but even without it he would have broken into an eager\nprotest.\n\n“Are you serious, Roderick?” he demanded.\n\n“Serious? of course not! How can a man with a crack in his brain be\nserious? how can a muddlehead reason? But I ‘m not jesting, either; I\ncan no more make jokes than utter oracles!”\n\n“Are you willing to go home?”\n\n“Willing? God forbid! I am simply amenable to force; if my mother\nchooses to take me, I won’t resist. I can’t! I have come to that!”\n\n“Let me resist, then,” said Rowland. “Go home as you are now? I can’t\nstand by and see it.”\n\nIt may have been true that Roderick had lost his sense of humor, but he\nscratched his head with a gesture that was almost comical in its effect.\n“You are a queer fellow! I should think I would disgust you horribly.”\n\n“Stay another year,” Rowland simply said.\n\n“Doing nothing?”\n\n“You shall do something. I am responsible for your doing something.”\n\n“To whom are you responsible?”\n\nRowland, before replying, glanced at Miss Garland, and his glance made\nher speak quickly. “Not to me!”\n\n“I ‘m responsible to myself,” Rowland declared.\n\n“My poor, dear fellow!” said Roderick.\n\n“Oh, Mr. Mallet, are n’t you satisfied?” cried Mrs. Hudson, in the tone\nin which Niobe may have addressed the avenging archers, after she had\nseen her eldest-born fall. “It ‘s out of all nature keeping him here.\nWhen we ‘re in a poor way, surely our own dear native land is the place\nfor us. Do leave us to ourselves, sir!”\n\nThis just failed of being a dismissal in form, and Rowland bowed his\nhead to it. Roderick was silent for some moments; then, suddenly, he\ncovered his face with his two hands. “Take me at least out of this\nterrible Italy,” he cried, “where everything mocks and reproaches and\ntorments and eludes me! Take me out of this land of impossible beauty\nand put me in the midst of ugliness. Set me down where nature is coarse\nand flat, and men and manners are vulgar. There must be something\nawfully ugly in Germany. Pack me off there!”\n\nRowland answered that if he wished to leave Italy the thing might be\narranged; he would think it over and submit a proposal on the morrow.\nHe suggested to Mrs. Hudson, in consequence, that she should spend the\nautumn in Switzerland, where she would find a fine tonic climate, plenty\nof fresh milk, and several pensions at three francs and a half a day.\nSwitzerland, of course, was not ugly, but one could not have everything.\n\nMrs. Hudson neither thanked him nor assented; but she wept and packed\nher trunks. Rowland had a theory, after the scene which led to these\npreparations, that Mary Garland was weary of waiting for Roderick to\ncome to his senses, that the faith which had bravely borne his manhood\ncompany hitherto, on the tortuous march he was leading it, had begun\nto believe it had gone far enough. This theory was not vitiated by\nsomething she said to him on the day before that on which Mrs. Hudson\nhad arranged to leave Florence.\n\n“Cousin Sarah, the other evening,” she said, “asked you to please leave\nus. I think she hardly knew what she was saying, and I hope you have not\ntaken offense.”\n\n“By no means; but I honestly believe that my leaving you would\ncontribute greatly to Mrs. Hudson’s comfort. I can be your hidden\nprovidence, you know; I can watch you at a distance, and come upon the\nscene at critical moments.”\n\nMiss Garland looked for a moment at the ground; and then, with sudden\nearnestness, “I beg you to come with us!” she said.\n\nIt need hardly be added that after this Rowland went with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. The Princess Casamassima\n\nRowland had a very friendly memory of a little mountain inn, accessible\nwith moderate trouble from Lucerne, where he had once spent a blissful\nten days. He had at that time been trudging, knapsack on back, over half\nSwitzerland, and not being, on his legs, a particularly light weight,\nit was no shame to him to confess that he was mortally tired. The inn\nof which I speak presented striking analogies with a cow-stable; but\nin spite of this circumstance, it was crowded with hungry tourists.\nIt stood in a high, shallow valley, with flower-strewn Alpine meadows\nsloping down to it from the base of certain rugged rocks whose outlines\nwere grotesque against the evening sky. Rowland had seen grander places\nin Switzerland that pleased him less, and whenever afterwards he wished\nto think of Alpine opportunities at their best, he recalled this grassy\nconcave among the mountain-tops, and the August days he spent there,\nresting deliciously, at his length, in the lee of a sun-warmed boulder,\nwith the light cool air stirring about his temples, the wafted odors of\nthe pines in his nostrils, the tinkle of the cattle-bells in his ears,\nthe vast progression of the mountain shadows before his eyes, and a\nvolume of Wordsworth in his pocket. His face, on the Swiss hill-sides,\nhad been scorched to within a shade of the color nowadays called\nmagenta, and his bed was a pallet in a loft, which he shared with a\nGerman botanist of colossal stature--every inch of him quaking at an\nopen window. These had been drawbacks to felicity, but Rowland hardly\ncared where or how he was lodged, for he spent the livelong day under\nthe sky, on the crest of a slope that looked at the Jungfrau. He\nremembered all this on leaving Florence with his friends, and he\nreflected that, as the midseason was over, accommodations would be more\nample, and charges more modest. He communicated with his old friend the\nlandlord, and, while September was yet young, his companions established\nthemselves under his guidance in the grassy valley.\n\nHe had crossed the Saint Gothard Pass with them, in the same carriage.\nDuring the journey from Florence, and especially during this portion\nof it, the cloud that hung over the little party had been almost\ndissipated, and they had looked at each other, in the close contiguity\nof the train and the posting-carriage, without either accusing or\nconsoling glances. It was impossible not to enjoy the magnificent\nscenery of the Apennines and the Italian Alps, and there was a tacit\nagreement among the travelers to abstain from sombre allusions. The\neffect of this delicate compact seemed excellent; it ensured them a\nweek’s intellectual sunshine. Roderick sat and gazed out of the window\nwith a fascinated stare, and with a perfect docility of attitude. He\nconcerned himself not a particle about the itinerary, or about any\nof the wayside arrangements; he took no trouble, and he gave none. He\nassented to everything that was proposed, talked very little, and led\nfor a week a perfectly contemplative life. His mother rarely removed\nher eyes from him; and if, a while before, this would have extremely\nirritated him, he now seemed perfectly unconscious of her observation\nand profoundly indifferent to anything that might befall him. They spent\na couple of days on the Lake of Como, at a hotel with white porticoes\nsmothered in oleander and myrtle, and the terrace-steps leading down\nto little boats with striped awnings. They agreed it was the earthly\nparadise, and they passed the mornings strolling through the perfumed\nalleys of classic villas, and the evenings floating in the moonlight in\na circle of outlined mountains, to the music of silver-trickling\noars. One day, in the afternoon, the two young men took a long stroll\ntogether. They followed the winding footway that led toward Como, close\nto the lake-side, past the gates of villas and the walls of vineyards,\nthrough little hamlets propped on a dozen arches, and bathing their feet\nand their pendant tatters in the gray-green ripple; past frescoed walls\nand crumbling campaniles and grassy village piazzas, and the mouth\nof soft ravines that wound upward, through belts of swinging vine and\nvaporous olive and splendid chestnut, to high ledges where white chapels\ngleamed amid the paler boskage, and bare cliff-surfaces, with their\nsun-cracked lips, drank in the azure light. It all was confoundingly\npicturesque; it was the Italy that we know from the steel engravings in\nold keepsakes and annuals, from the vignettes on music-sheets and\nthe drop-curtains at theatres; an Italy that we can never confess to\nourselves--in spite of our own changes and of Italy’s--that we have\nceased to believe in. Rowland and Roderick turned aside from the little\npaved footway that clambered and dipped and wound and doubled beside\nthe lake, and stretched themselves idly beneath a fig-tree, on a grassy\npromontory. Rowland had never known anything so divinely soothing as the\ndreamy softness of that early autumn afternoon. The iridescent mountains\nshut him in; the little waves, beneath him, fretted the white pebbles at\nthe laziest intervals; the festooned vines above him swayed just visibly\nin the all but motionless air.\n\nRoderick lay observing it all with his arms thrown back and his hands\nunder his head. “This suits me,” he said; “I could be happy here and\nforget everything. Why not stay here forever?” He kept his position for\na long time and seemed lost in his thoughts. Rowland spoke to him, but\nhe made vague answers; at last he closed his eyes. It seemed to Rowland,\nalso, a place to stay in forever; a place for perfect oblivion of the\ndisagreeable. Suddenly Roderick turned over on his face, and buried it\nin his arms. There had been something passionate in his movement; but\nRowland was nevertheless surprised, when he at last jerked himself back\ninto a sitting posture, to perceive the trace of tears in his eyes.\nRoderick turned to his friend, stretching his two hands out toward the\nlake and mountains, and shaking them with an eloquent gesture, as if his\nheart was too full for utterance.\n\n“Pity me, sir; pity me!” he presently cried. “Look at this lovely world,\nand think what it must be to be dead to it!”\n\n“Dead?” said Rowland.\n\n“Dead, dead; dead and buried! Buried in an open grave, where you lie\nstaring up at the sailing clouds, smelling the waving flowers, and\nhearing all nature live and grow above you! That ‘s the way I feel!”\n\n“I am glad to hear it,” said Rowland. “Death of that sort is very near\nto resurrection.”\n\n“It ‘s too horrible,” Roderick went on; “it has all come over me here\ntremendously! If I were not ashamed, I could shed a bushel of tears. For\none hour of what I have been, I would give up anything I may be!”\n\n“Never mind what you have been; be something better!”\n\n“I shall never be anything again: it ‘s no use talking! But I don’t know\nwhat secret spring has been touched since I have lain here. Something\nin my heart seemed suddenly to open and let in a flood of beauty and\ndesire. I know what I have lost, and I think it horrible! Mind you,\nI know it, I feel it! Remember that hereafter. Don’t say that he\nwas stupefied and senseless; that his perception was dulled and his\naspiration dead. Say that he trembled in every nerve with a sense of\nthe beauty and sweetness of life; that he rebelled and protested and\nshrieked; that he was buried alive, with his eyes open, and his heart\nbeating to madness; that he clung to every blade of grass and every\nway-side thorn as he passed; that it was the most horrible spectacle you\never witnessed; that it was an outrage, a murder, a massacre!”\n\n“Good heavens, man, are you insane?” Rowland cried.\n\n“I never have been saner. I don’t want to be bad company, and in this\nbeautiful spot, at this delightful hour, it seems an outrage to break\nthe charm. But I am bidding farewell to Italy, to beauty, to honor, to\nlife! I only want to assure you that I know what I lose. I know it in\nevery pulse of my heart! Here, where these things are all loveliest, I\ntake leave of them. Farewell, farewell!”\n\nDuring their passage of the Saint Gothard, Roderick absented himself\nmuch of the time from the carriage, and rambled far in advance, along\nthe huge zigzags of the road. He displayed an extraordinary activity;\nhis light weight and slender figure made him an excellent pedestrian,\nand his friends frequently saw him skirting the edge of plunging chasms,\nloosening the stones on long, steep slopes, or lifting himself against\nthe sky, from the top of rocky pinnacles. Mary Garland walked a great\ndeal, but she remained near the carriage to be with Mrs. Hudson. Rowland\nremained near it to be with Miss Garland. He trudged by her side up that\nmagnificent ascent from Italy, and found himself regretting that the\nAlps were so low, and that their trudging was not to last a week. She\nwas exhilarated; she liked to walk; in the way of mountains, until\nwithin the last few weeks, she had seen nothing greater than Mount\nHolyoke, and she found that the Alps amply justified their reputation.\nRowland knew that she loved nature, but he was struck afresh with the\nvivacity of her observation of it, and with her knowledge of plants and\nstones. At that season the wild flowers had mostly departed, but a few\nof them lingered, and Miss Garland never failed to espy them in their\noutlying corners. They interested her greatly; she was charmed when\nthey were old friends, and charmed even more when they were new. She\ndisplayed a very light foot in going in quest of them, and had soon\ncovered the front seat of the carriage with a tangle of strange\nvegetation. Rowland of course was alert in her service, and he gathered\nfor her several botanical specimens which at first seemed inaccessible.\nOne of these, indeed, had at first appeared easier of capture than his\nattempt attested, and he had paused a moment at the base of the little\npeak on which it grew, measuring the risk of farther pursuit. Suddenly,\nas he stood there, he remembered Roderick’s defiance of danger and of\nMiss Light, at the Coliseum, and he was seized with a strong desire to\ntest the courage of his companion. She had just scrambled up a grassy\nslope near him, and had seen that the flower was out of reach. As he\nprepared to approach it, she called to him eagerly to stop; the thing\nwas impossible! Poor Rowland, whose passion had been terribly starved,\nenjoyed immensely the thought of having her care, for three minutes,\nwhat became of him. He was the least brutal of men, but for a moment he\nwas perfectly indifferent to her suffering.\n\n“I can get the flower,” he called to her. “Will you trust me?”\n\n“I don’t want it; I would rather not have it!” she cried.\n\n“Will you trust me?” he repeated, looking at her.\n\nShe looked at him and then at the flower; he wondered whether she would\nshriek and swoon, as Miss Light had done. “I wish it were something\nbetter!” she said simply; and then stood watching him, while he began to\nclamber. Rowland was not shaped for an acrobat, and his enterprise\nwas difficult; but he kept his wits about him, made the most of narrow\nfoot-holds and coigns of vantage, and at last secured his prize.\nHe managed to stick it into his buttonhole and then he contrived to\ndescend. There was more than one chance for an ugly fall, but he evaded\nthem all. It was doubtless not gracefully done, but it was done, and\nthat was all he had proposed to himself. He was red in the face when\nhe offered Miss Garland the flower, and she was visibly pale. She had\nwatched him without moving. All this had passed without the knowledge\nof Mrs. Hudson, who was dozing beneath the hood of the carriage. Mary\nGarland’s eyes did not perhaps display that ardent admiration which\nwas formerly conferred by the queen of beauty at a tournament; but they\nexpressed something in which Rowland found his reward. “Why did you do\nthat?” she asked, gravely.\n\nHe hesitated. He felt that it was physically possible to say, “Because\nI love you!” but that it was not morally possible. He lowered his pitch\nand answered, simply, “Because I wanted to do something for you.”\n\n“Suppose you had fallen,” said Miss Garland.\n\n“I believed I would not fall. And you believed it, I think.”\n\n“I believed nothing. I simply trusted you, as you asked me.”\n\n“Quod erat demonstrandum!” cried Rowland. “I think you know Latin.”\n\nWhen our four friends were established in what I have called their\ngrassy valley, there was a good deal of scrambling over slopes both\ngrassy and stony, a good deal of flower-plucking on narrow ledges, a\ngreat many long walks, and, thanks to the lucid mountain air, not a\nlittle exhilaration. Mrs. Hudson was obliged to intermit her suspicions\nof the deleterious atmosphere of the old world, and to acknowledge the\nedifying purity of the breezes of Engelthal. She was certainly more\nplacid than she had been in Italy; having always lived in the country,\nshe had missed in Rome and Florence that social solitude mitigated by\nbushes and rocks which is so dear to the true New England temperament.\nThe little unpainted inn at Engelthal, with its plank partitions, its\nmilk-pans standing in the sun, its “help,” in the form of angular young\nwomen of the country-side, reminded her of places of summer sojourn\nin her native land; and the beautiful historic chambers of the Villa\nPandolfini passed from her memory without a regret, and without having\nin the least modified her ideal of domiciliary grace. Roderick had\nchanged his sky, but he had not changed his mind; his humor was still\nthat of which he had given Rowland a glimpse in that tragic explosion on\nthe Lake of Como. He kept his despair to himself, and he went doggedly\nabout the ordinary business of life; but it was easy to see that his\nspirit was mortally heavy, and that he lived and moved and talked simply\nfrom the force of habit. In that sad half-hour among the Italian olives\nthere had been such a fierce sincerity in his tone, that Rowland\nbegan to abdicate the critical attitude. He began to feel that it was\nessentially vain to appeal to the poor fellow’s will; there was no will\nleft; its place was an impotent void. This view of the case indeed was\noccasionally contravened by certain indications on Roderick’s part of\nthe power of resistance to disagreeable obligations: one might still\nhave said, if one had been disposed to be didactic at any hazard,\nthat there was a method in his madness, that his moral energy had its\nsleeping and its waking hours, and that, in a cause that pleased it, it\nwas capable of rising with the dawn. But on the other hand, pleasure, in\nthis case, was quite at one with effort; evidently the greatest bliss in\nlife, for Roderick, would have been to have a plastic idea. And then, it\nwas impossible not to feel tenderly to a despair which had so ceased to\nbe aggressive--not to forgive a great deal of apathy to a temper\nwhich had so unlearned its irritability. Roderick said frankly that\nSwitzerland made him less miserable than Italy, and the Alps seemed less\nto mock at his enforced leisure than the Apennines. He indulged in\nlong rambles, generally alone, and was very fond of climbing into dizzy\nplaces, where no sound could overtake him, and there, flinging himself\non the never-trodden moss, of pulling his hat over his eyes and lounging\naway the hours in perfect immobility. Rowland sometimes walked with\nhim; though Roderick never invited him, he seemed duly grateful for his\nsociety. Rowland now made it a rule to treat him like a perfectly sane\nman, to assume that all things were well with him, and never to allude\nto the prosperity he had forfeited or to the work he was not doing. He\nwould have still said, had you questioned him, that Roderick’s condition\nwas a mood--certainly a puzzling one. It might last yet for many a weary\nhour; but it was a long lane that had no turning. Roderick’s blues would\nnot last forever. Rowland’s interest in Miss Garland’s relations with\nher cousin was still profoundly attentive, and perplexed as he was on\nall sides, he found nothing transparent here. After their arrival at\nEngelthal, Roderick appeared to seek the young girl’s society more than\nhe had done hitherto, and this revival of ardor could not fail to set\nhis friend a-wondering. They sat together and strolled together, and\nMiss Garland often read aloud to him. One day, on their coming to\ndinner, after he had been lying half the morning at her feet, in the\nshadow of a rock, Rowland asked him what she had been reading.\n\n“I don’t know,” Roderick said, “I don’t heed the sense.” Miss Garland\nheard this, and Rowland looked at her. She looked at Roderick sharply\nand with a little blush. “I listen to Mary,” Roderick continued,\n“for the sake of her voice. It ‘s distractingly sweet!” At this Miss\nGarland’s blush deepened, and she looked away.\n\nRowland, in Florence, as we know, had suffered his imagination to\nwander in the direction of certain conjectures which the reader may deem\nunflattering to Miss Garland’s constancy. He had asked himself whether\nher faith in Roderick had not faltered, and that demand of hers which\nhad brought about his own departure for Switzerland had seemed almost\nequivalent to a confession that she needed his help to believe. Rowland\nwas essentially a modest man, and he did not risk the supposition that\nMiss Garland had contrasted him with Roderick to his own advantage; but\nhe had a certain consciousness of duty resolutely done which allowed\nitself to fancy, at moments, that it might be not illogically rewarded\nby the bestowal of such stray grains of enthusiasm as had crumbled away\nfrom her estimate of his companion. If some day she had declared, in a\nsudden burst of passion, that she was outwearied and sickened, and that\nshe gave up her recreant lover, Rowland’s expectation would have gone\nhalf-way to meet her. And certainly if her passion had taken this course\nno generous critic would utterly condemn her. She had been neglected,\nignored, forsaken, treated with a contempt which no girl of a fine\ntemper could endure. There were girls, indeed, whose fineness, like that\nof Burd Helen in the ballad, lay in clinging to the man of their love\nthrough thick and thin, and in bowing their head to all hard usage. This\nattitude had often an exquisite beauty of its own, but Rowland deemed\nthat he had solid reason to believe it never could be Mary Garland’s.\nShe was not a passive creature; she was not soft and meek and grateful\nfor chance bounties. With all her reserve of manner she was proud and\neager; she asked much and she wanted what she asked; she believed in\nfine things and she never could long persuade herself that fine things\nmissed were as beautiful as fine things achieved. Once Rowland passed an\nangry day. He had dreamed--it was the most insubstantial of dreams--that\nshe had given him the right to believe that she looked to him to\ntransmute her discontent. And yet here she was throwing herself back\ninto Roderick’s arms at his lightest overture, and playing with his own\nhalf fearful, half shameful hopes! Rowland declared to himself that\nhis position was essentially detestable, and that all the philosophy\nhe could bring to bear upon it would make it neither honorable nor\ncomfortable. He would go away and make an end of it. He did not go away;\nhe simply took a long walk, stayed away from the inn all day, and on his\nreturn found Miss Garland sitting out in the moonlight with Roderick.\n\nRowland, communing with himself during the restless ramble in question,\nhad determined that he would at least cease to observe, to heed, or\nto care for what Miss Garland and Roderick might do or might not do\ntogether. Nevertheless, some three days afterward, the opportunity\npresenting itself, he deliberately broached the subject with Roderick.\nHe knew this was inconsistent and faint-hearted; it was indulgence\nto the fingers that itched to handle forbidden fruit. But he said to\nhimself that it was really more logical to be inconsistent than the\nreverse; for they had formerly discussed these mysteries very candidly.\nWas it not perfectly reasonable that he should wish to know the sequel\nof the situation which Roderick had then delineated? Roderick had made\nhim promises, and it was to be expected that he should ascertain how\nthe promises had been kept. Rowland could not say to himself that if\nthe promises had been extorted for Mary Garland’s sake, his present\nattention to them was equally disinterested; and so he had to admit\nthat he was indeed faint-hearted. He may perhaps be deemed too narrow\na casuist, but we have repeated more than once that he was solidly\nburdened with a conscience.\n\n“I imagine,” he said to Roderick, “that you are not sorry, at present,\nto have allowed yourself to be dissuaded from making a final rupture\nwith Miss Garland.”\n\nRoderick eyed him with the vague and absent look which had lately become\nhabitual to his face, and repeated “Dissuaded?”\n\n“Don’t you remember that, in Rome, you wished to break your engagement,\nand that I urged you to respect it, though it seemed to hang by so\nslender a thread? I wished you to see what would come of it? If I am not\nmistaken, you are reconciled to it.”\n\n“Oh yes,” said Roderick, “I remember what you said; you made it a\nkind of personal favor to yourself that I should remain faithful. I\nconsented, but afterwards, when I thought of it, your attitude greatly\namused me. Had it ever been seen before?--a man asking another man to\ngratify him by not suspending his attentions to a pretty girl!”\n\n“It was as selfish as anything else,” said Rowland. “One man puts his\nselfishness into one thing, and one into another. It would have utterly\nmarred my comfort to see Miss Garland in low spirits.”\n\n“But you liked her--you admired her, eh? So you intimated.”\n\n“I admire her profoundly.”\n\n“It was your originality then--to do you justice you have a great deal,\nof a certain sort--to wish her happiness secured in just that fashion.\nMany a man would have liked better himself to make the woman he admired\nhappy, and would have welcomed her low spirits as an opening for\nsympathy. You were awfully queer about it.”\n\n“So be it!” said Rowland. “The question is, Are you not glad I was\nqueer? Are you not finding that your affection for Miss Garland has a\npermanent quality which you rather underestimated?”\n\n“I don’t pretend to say. When she arrived in Rome, I found I did n’t\ncare for her, and I honestly proposed that we should have no humbug\nabout it. If you, on the contrary, thought there was something to be\ngained by having a little humbug, I was willing to try it! I don’t see\nthat the situation is really changed. Mary Garland is all that she ever\nwas--more than all. But I don’t care for her! I don’t care for anything,\nand I don’t find myself inspired to make an exception in her favor. The\nonly difference is that I don’t care now, whether I care for her or not.\nOf course, marrying such a useless lout as I am is out of the question\nfor any woman, and I should pay Miss Garland a poor compliment to assume\nthat she is in a hurry to celebrate our nuptials.”\n\n“Oh, you ‘re in love!” said Rowland, not very logically. It must be\nconfessed, at any cost, that this assertion was made for the sole\npurpose of hearing Roderick deny it.\n\nBut it quite failed of its aim. Roderick gave a liberal shrug of his\nshoulders and an irresponsible toss of his head. “Call it what you\nplease! I am past caring for names.”\n\nRowland had not only been illogical, he had also been slightly\ndisingenuous. He did not believe that his companion was in love; he\nhad argued the false to learn the true. The true was that Roderick was\nagain, in some degree, under a charm, and that he found a healing virtue\nin Mary’s presence, indisposed though he was to admit it. He had said,\nshortly before, that her voice was sweet to his ear; and this was a\npromising beginning. If her voice was sweet it was probable that her\nglance was not amiss, that her touch had a quiet magic, and that her\nwhole personal presence had learned the art of not being irritating.\nSo Rowland reasoned, and invested Mary Garland with a still finer\nloveliness.\n\nIt was true that she herself helped him little to definite conclusions,\nand that he remained in puzzled doubt as to whether these happy touches\nwere still a matter of the heart, or had become simply a matter of the\nconscience. He watched for signs that she rejoiced in Roderick’s renewed\nacceptance of her society; but it seemed to him that she was on her\nguard against interpreting it too largely. It was now her turn--he\nfancied that he sometimes gathered from certain nameless indications of\nglance and tone and gesture--it was now her turn to be indifferent, to\ncare for other things. Again and again Rowland asked himself what these\nthings were that Miss Garland might be supposed to care for, to the\ninjury of ideal constancy; and again, having designated them, he divided\nthem into two portions. One was that larger experience, in general,\nwhich had come to her with her arrival in Europe; the vague sense, borne\nin upon her imagination, that there were more things one might do with\none’s life than youth and ignorance and Northampton had dreamt of; the\nrevision of old pledges in the light of new emotions. The other was the\nexperience, in especial, of Rowland’s--what? Here Rowland always paused,\nin perfect sincerity, to measure afresh his possible claim to the young\ngirl’s regard. What might he call it? It had been more than civility and\nyet it had been less than devotion. It had spoken of a desire to serve,\nbut it had said nothing of a hope of reward. Nevertheless, Rowland’s\nfancy hovered about the idea that it was recompensable, and his\nreflections ended in a reverie which perhaps did not define it, but\nat least, on each occasion, added a little to its volume. Since Miss\nGarland had asked him as a sort of favor to herself to come also to\nSwitzerland, he thought it possible she might let him know whether he\nseemed to have effectively served her. The days passed without her doing\nso, and at last Rowland walked away to an isolated eminence some\nfive miles from the inn and murmured to the silent rocks that she was\nungrateful. Listening nature seemed not to contradict him, so that,\non the morrow, he asked the young girl, with an infinitesimal touch of\nirony, whether it struck her that his deflection from his Florentine\nplan had been attended with brilliant results.\n\n“Why, we are delighted that you are with us!” she answered.\n\nHe was anything but satisfied with this; it seemed to imply that she had\nforgotten that she had solemnly asked him to come. He reminded her\nof her request, and recalled the place and time. “That evening on the\nterrace, late, after Mrs. Hudson had gone to bed, and Roderick being\nabsent.”\n\nShe perfectly remembered, but the memory seemed to trouble her. “I am\nafraid your kindness has been a great charge upon you,” she said. “You\nwanted very much to do something else.”\n\n“I wanted above all things to oblige you, and I made no sacrifice. But\nif I had made an immense one, it would be more than made up to me by any\nassurance that I have helped Roderick into a better mood.”\n\nShe was silent a moment, and then, “Why do you ask me?” she said. “You\nare able to judge quite as well as I.”\n\nRowland blushed; he desired to justify himself in the most veracious\nmanner. “The truth is,” he said, “that I am afraid I care only in the\nsecond place for Roderick’s holding up his head. What I care for in the\nfirst place is your happiness.”\n\n“I don’t know why that should be,” she answered. “I have certainly\ndone nothing to make you so much my friend. If you were to tell me you\nintended to leave us to-morrow, I am afraid that I should not venture\nto ask you to stay. But whether you go or stay, let us not talk of\nRoderick!”\n\n“But that,” said Rowland, “does n’t answer my question. Is he better?”\n\n“No!” she said, and turned away.\n\nHe was careful not to tell her that he intended to leave them. One day,\nshortly after this, as the two young men sat at the inn-door watching\nthe sunset, which on that evening was very striking and lurid, Rowland\nmade an attempt to sound his companion’s present sentiment touching\nChristina Light. “I wonder where she is,” he said, “and what sort of a\nlife she is leading her prince.”\n\nRoderick at first made no response. He was watching a figure on\nthe summit of some distant rocks, opposite to them. The figure was\napparently descending into the valley, and in relief against the crimson\nscreen of the western sky, it looked gigantic. “Christina Light?”\n Roderick at last repeated, as if arousing himself from a reverie. “Where\nshe is? It ‘s extraordinary how little I care!”\n\n“Have you, then, completely got over it?”\n\nTo this Roderick made no direct reply; he sat brooding a while. “She ‘s\na humbug!” he presently exclaimed.\n\n“Possibly!” said Rowland. “But I have known worse ones.”\n\n“She disappointed me!” Roderick continued in the same tone.\n\n“Had she, then, really given you hopes?”\n\n“Oh, don’t recall it!” Roderick cried. “Why the devil should I think\nof it? It was only three months ago, but it seems like ten years.”\n His friend said nothing more, and after a while he went on of his\nown accord. “I believed there was a future in it all! She pleased\nme--pleased me; and when an artist--such as I was--is pleased, you\nknow!” And he paused again. “You never saw her as I did; you never heard\nher in her great moments. But there is no use talking about that! At\nfirst she would n’t regard me seriously; she chaffed me and made light\nof me. But at last I forced her to admit I was a great man. Think of\nthat, sir! Christina Light called me a great man. A great man was what\nshe was looking for, and we agreed to find our happiness for life in\neach other. To please me she promised not to marry till I gave her\nleave. I was not in a marrying way myself, but it was damnation to think\nof another man possessing her. To spare my sensibilities, she promised\nto turn off her prince, and the idea of her doing so made me as happy as\nto see a perfect statue shaping itself in the block. You have seen how\nshe kept her promise! When I learned it, it was as if the statue had\nsuddenly cracked and turned hideous. She died for me, like that!” And\nhe snapped his fingers. “Was it wounded vanity, disappointed desire,\nbetrayed confidence? I am sure I don’t know; you certainly have some\nname for it.”\n\n“The poor girl did the best she could,” said Rowland.\n\n“If that was her best, so much the worse for her! I have hardly thought\nof her these two months, but I have not forgiven her.”\n\n“Well, you may believe that you are avenged. I can’t think of her as\nhappy.”\n\n“I don’t pity her!” said Roderick. Then he relapsed into silence, and\nthe two sat watching the colossal figure as it made its way downward\nalong the jagged silhouette of the rocks. “Who is this mighty man,”\n cried Roderick at last, “and what is he coming down upon us for? We are\nsmall people here, and we can’t undertake to keep company with giants.”\n\n“Wait till we meet him on our own level,” said Rowland, “and perhaps he\nwill not overtop us.”\n\n“For ten minutes, at least,” Roderick rejoined, “he will have been a\ngreat man!” At this moment the figure sank beneath the horizon line\nand became invisible in the uncertain light. Suddenly Roderick said, “I\nwould like to see her once more--simply to look at her.”\n\n“I would not advise it,” said Rowland.\n\n“It was her beauty that did it!” Roderick went on. “It was all her\nbeauty; in comparison, the rest was nothing. What befooled me was to\nthink of it as my property! And I had made it mine--no one else had\nstudied it as I had, no one else understood it. What does that stick of\na Casamassima know about it at this hour? I should like to see it just\nonce more; it ‘s the only thing in the world of which I can say so.”\n\n“I would not advise it,” Rowland repeated.\n\n“That ‘s right, dear Rowland,” said Roderick; “don’t advise! That ‘s no\nuse now.”\n\nThe dusk meanwhile had thickened, and they had not perceived a figure\napproaching them across the open space in front of the house. Suddenly\nit stepped into the circle of light projected from the door and windows,\nand they beheld little Sam Singleton stopping to stare at them. He was\nthe giant whom they had seen descending along the rocks. When this was\nmade apparent Roderick was seized with a fit of intense hilarity--it was\nthe first time he had laughed in three months. Singleton, who carried\na knapsack and walking-staff, received from Rowland the friendliest\nwelcome. He was in the serenest possible humor, and if in the way of\nluggage his knapsack contained nothing but a comb and a second shirt, he\nproduced from it a dozen admirable sketches. He had been trudging over\nhalf Switzerland and making everywhere the most vivid pictorial notes.\nThey were mostly in a box at Interlaken, and in gratitude for Rowland’s\nappreciation, he presently telegraphed for his box, which, according to\nthe excellent Swiss method, was punctually delivered by post. The nights\nwere cold, and our friends, with three or four other chance sojourners,\nsat in-doors over a fire of logs. Even with Roderick sitting moodily in\nthe outer shadow they made a sympathetic little circle, and they turned\nover Singleton’s drawings, while he perched in the chimney-corner,\nblushing and grinning, with his feet on the rounds of his chair. He had\nbeen pedestrianizing for six weeks, and he was glad to rest awhile at\nEngelthal. It was an economic repose, however, for he sallied forth\nevery morning, with his sketching tools on his back, in search of\nmaterial for new studies. Roderick’s hilarity, after the first evening,\nhad subsided, and he watched the little painter’s serene activity with a\ngravity that was almost portentous. Singleton, who was not in the secret\nof his personal misfortunes, still treated him with timid frankness as\nthe rising star of American art. Roderick had said to Rowland, at\nfirst, that Singleton reminded him of some curious little insect with a\nremarkable mechanical instinct in its antennae; but as the days went by\nit was apparent that the modest landscapist’s unflagging industry grew\nto have an oppressive meaning for him. It pointed a moral, and Roderick\nused to sit and con the moral as he saw it figured in Singleton’s bent\nback, on the hot hill-sides, protruding from beneath his white umbrella.\nOne day he wandered up a long slope and overtook him as he sat at work;\nSingleton related the incident afterwards to Rowland, who, after giving\nhim in Rome a hint of Roderick’s aberrations, had strictly kept his own\ncounsel.\n\n“Are you always like this?” said Roderick, in almost sepulchral accents.\n\n“Like this?” repeated Singleton, blinking confusedly, with an alarmed\nconscience.\n\n“You remind me of a watch that never runs down. If one listens hard one\nhears you always--tic-tic, tic-tic.”\n\n“Oh, I see,” said Singleton, beaming ingenuously. “I am very equable.”\n\n“You are very equable, yes. And do you find it pleasant to be equable?”\n\nSingleton turned and grinned more brightly, while he sucked the water\nfrom his camel’s-hair brush. Then, with a quickened sense of his\nindebtedness to a Providence that had endowed him with intrinsic\nfacilities, “Oh, delightful!” he exclaimed.\n\nRoderick stood looking at him a moment. “Damnation!” he said at last,\nsolemnly, and turned his back.\n\nOne morning, shortly after this, Rowland and Roderick took a long walk.\nThey had walked before in a dozen different directions, but they had not\nyet crossed a charming little wooded pass, which shut in their valley\non one side and descended into the vale of Engelberg. In coming from\nLucerne they had approached their inn by this path, and, feeling that\nthey knew it, had hitherto neglected it in favor of untrodden ways. But\nat last the list of these was exhausted, and Rowland proposed the walk\nto Engelberg as a novelty. The place is half bleak and half pastoral; a\nhuge white monastery rises abruptly from the green floor of the valley\nand complicates its picturesqueness with an element rare in Swiss\nscenery. Hard by is a group of chalets and inns, with the usual\nappurtenances of a prosperous Swiss resort--lean brown guides in baggy\nhomespun, lounging under carved wooden galleries, stacks of alpenstocks\nin every doorway, sun-scorched Englishmen without shirt-collars. Our two\nfriends sat a while at the door of an inn, discussing a pint of wine,\nand then Roderick, who was indefatigable, announced his intention of\nclimbing to a certain rocky pinnacle which overhung the valley, and,\naccording to the testimony of one of the guides, commanded a view of the\nLake of Lucerne. To go and come back was only a matter of an hour, but\nRowland, with the prospect of his homeward trudge before him, confessed\nto a preference for lounging on his bench, or at most strolling a trifle\nfarther and taking a look at the monastery. Roderick went off alone, and\nhis companion after a while bent his steps to the monasterial church. It\nwas remarkable, like most of the churches of Catholic Switzerland, for\na hideous style of devotional ornament; but it had a certain cold and\nmusty picturesqueness, and Rowland lingered there with some tenderness\nfor Alpine piety. While he was near the high-altar some people came in\nat the west door; but he did not notice them, and was presently engaged\nin deciphering a curious old German epitaph on one of the mural tablets.\nAt last he turned away, wondering whether its syntax or its theology was\nthe more uncomfortable, and, to this infinite surprise, found himself\nconfronted with the Prince and Princess Casamassima.\n\nThe surprise on Christina’s part, for an instant, was equal, and at\nfirst she seemed disposed to turn away without letting it give place to\na greeting. The prince, however, saluted gravely, and then Christina, in\nsilence, put out her hand. Rowland immediately asked whether they were\nstaying at Engelberg, but Christina only looked at him without speaking.\nThe prince answered his questions, and related that they had been\nmaking a month’s tour in Switzerland, that at Lucerne his wife had been\nsomewhat obstinately indisposed, and that the physician had recommended\na week’s trial of the tonic air and goat’s milk of Engelberg. The\nscenery, said the prince, was stupendous, but the life was terribly\nsad--and they had three days more! It was a blessing, he urbanely added,\nto see a good Roman face.\n\nChristina’s attitude, her solemn silence and her penetrating gaze\nseemed to Rowland, at first, to savor of affectation; but he presently\nperceived that she was profoundly agitated, and that she was afraid of\nbetraying herself. “Do let us leave this hideous edifice,” she said;\n“there are things here that set one’s teeth on edge.” They moved slowly\nto the door, and when they stood outside, in the sunny coolness of the\nvalley, she turned to Rowland and said, “I am extremely glad to see\nyou.” Then she glanced about her and observed, against the wall of the\nchurch, an old stone seat. She looked at Prince Casamassima a moment,\nand he smiled more intensely, Rowland thought, than the occasion\ndemanded. “I wish to sit here,” she said, “and speak to Mr.\nMallet--alone.”\n\n“At your pleasure, dear friend,” said the prince.\n\nThe tone of each was measured, to Rowland’s ear; but that of Christina\nwas dry, and that of her husband was splendidly urbane. Rowland\nremembered that the Cavaliere Giacosa had told him that Mrs. Light’s\ncandidate was thoroughly a prince, and our friend wondered how he\nrelished a peremptory accent. Casamassima was an Italian of the\nundemonstrative type, but Rowland nevertheless divined that, like other\nprinces before him, he had made the acquaintance of the thing called\ncompromise. “Shall I come back?” he asked with the same smile.\n\n“In half an hour,” said Christina.\n\nIn the clear outer light, Rowland’s first impression of her was that she\nwas more beautiful than ever. And yet in three months she could hardly\nhave changed; the change was in Rowland’s own vision of her, which that\nlast interview, on the eve of her marriage, had made unprecedentedly\ntender.\n\n“How came you here?” she asked. “Are you staying in this place?”\n\n“I am staying at Engelthal, some ten miles away; I walked over.”\n\n“Are you alone?”\n\n“I am with Mr. Hudson.”\n\n“Is he here with you?”\n\n“He went half an hour ago to climb a rock for a view.”\n\n“And his mother and that young girl, where are they?”\n\n“They also are at Engelthal.”\n\n“What do you do there?”\n\n“What do you do here?” said Rowland, smiling.\n\n“I count the minutes till my week is up. I hate mountains; they depress\nme to death. I am sure Miss Garland likes them.”\n\n“She is very fond of them, I believe.”\n\n“You believe--don’t you know? But I have given up trying to imitate Miss\nGarland,” said Christina.\n\n“You surely need imitate no one.”\n\n“Don’t say that,” she said gravely. “So you have walked ten miles this\nmorning? And you are to walk back again?”\n\n“Back again to supper.”\n\n“And Mr. Hudson too?”\n\n“Mr. Hudson especially. He is a great walker.”\n\n“You men are happy!” Christina cried. “I believe I should enjoy the\nmountains if I could do such things. It is sitting still and having them\nscowl down at you! Prince Casamassina never rides. He only goes on a\nmule. He was carried up the Faulhorn on a litter.”\n\n“On a litter?” said Rowland.\n\n“In one of those machines--a chaise a porteurs--like a woman.”\n\nRowland received this information in silence; it was equally unbecoming\nto either relish or deprecate its irony.\n\n“Is Mr. Hudson to join you again? Will he come here?” Christina asked.\n\n“I shall soon begin to expect him.”\n\n“What shall you do when you leave Switzerland?” Christina continued.\n“Shall you go back to Rome?”\n\n“I rather doubt it. My plans are very uncertain.”\n\n“They depend upon Mr. Hudson, eh?”\n\n“In a great measure.”\n\n“I want you to tell me about him. Is he still in that perverse state of\nmind that afflicted you so much?”\n\nRowland looked at her mistrustfully, without answering. He was\nindisposed, instinctively, to tell her that Roderick was unhappy; it was\npossible she might offer to help him back to happiness. She immediately\nperceived his hesitation.\n\n“I see no reason why we should not be frank,” she said. “I should think\nwe were excellently placed for that sort of thing. You remember that\nformerly I cared very little what I said, don’t you? Well, I care\nabsolutely not at all now. I say what I please, I do what I please! How\ndid Mr. Hudson receive the news of my marriage?”\n\n“Very badly,” said Rowland.\n\n“With rage and reproaches?” And as Rowland hesitated again--“With silent\ncontempt?”\n\n“I can tell you but little. He spoke to me on the subject, but I stopped\nhim. I told him it was none of his business, or of mine.”\n\n“That was an excellent answer!” said Christina, softly. “Yet it was a\nlittle your business, after those sublime protestations I treated you\nto. I was really very fine that morning, eh?”\n\n“You do yourself injustice,” said Rowland. “I should be at liberty now\nto believe you were insincere.”\n\n“What does it matter now whether I was insincere or not? I can’t\nconceive of anything mattering less. I was very fine--is n’t it true?”\n\n“You know what I think of you,” said Rowland. And for fear of being\nforced to betray his suspicion of the cause of her change, he took\nrefuge in a commonplace. “Your mother, I hope, is well.”\n\n“My mother is in the enjoyment of superb health, and may be seen\nevery evening at the Casino, at the Baths of Lucca, confiding to every\nnew-comer that she has married her daughter to a pearl of a prince.”\n\nRowland was anxious for news of Mrs. Light’s companion, and the natural\ncourse was frankly to inquire about him. “And the Cavaliere Giacosa is\nwell?” he asked.\n\nChristina hesitated, but she betrayed no other embarrassment. “The\nCavaliere has retired to his native city of Ancona, upon a pension, for\nthe rest of his natural life. He is a very good old man!”\n\n“I have a great regard for him,” said Rowland, gravely, at the same time\nthat he privately wondered whether the Cavaliere’s pension was paid\nby Prince Casamassima for services rendered in connection with his\nmarriage. Had the Cavaliere received his commission? “And what do you\ndo,” Rowland continued, “on leaving this place?”\n\n“We go to Italy--we go to Naples.” She rose and stood silent a moment,\nlooking down the valley. The figure of Prince Casamassima appeared in\nthe distance, balancing his white umbrella. As her eyes rested upon it,\nRowland imagined that he saw something deeper in the strange expression\nwhich had lurked in her face while he talked to her. At first he had\nbeen dazzled by her blooming beauty, to which the lapse of weeks had\nonly added splendor; then he had seen a heavier ray in the light of her\neye--a sinister intimation of sadness and bitterness. It was the outward\nmark of her sacrificed ideal. Her eyes grew cold as she looked at her\nhusband, and when, after a moment, she turned them upon Rowland, they\nstruck him as intensely tragical. He felt a singular mixture of sympathy\nand dread; he wished to give her a proof of friendship, and yet it\nseemed to him that she had now turned her face in a direction where\nfriendship was impotent to interpose. She half read his feelings,\napparently, and she gave a beautiful, sad smile. “I hope we may never\nmeet again!” she said. And as Rowland gave her a protesting look--“You\nhave seen me at my best. I wish to tell you solemnly, I was sincere! I\nknow appearances are against me,” she went on quickly. “There is a great\ndeal I can’t tell you. Perhaps you have guessed it; I care very little.\nYou know, at any rate, I did my best. It would n’t serve; I was beaten\nand broken; they were stronger than I. Now it ‘s another affair!”\n\n“It seems to me you have a large chance for happiness yet,” said\nRowland, vaguely.\n\n“Happiness? I mean to cultivate rapture; I mean to go in for bliss\nineffable! You remember I told you that I was, in part, the world’s and\nthe devil’s. Now they have taken me all. It was their choice; may they\nnever repent!”\n\n“I shall hear of you,” said Rowland.\n\n“You will hear of me. And whatever you do hear, remember this: I was\nsincere!”\n\nPrince Casamassima had approached, and Rowland looked at him with a\ngood deal of simple compassion as a part of that “world” against which\nChristina had launched her mysterious menace. It was obvious that he\nwas a good fellow, and that he could not, in the nature of things, be\na positively bad husband; but his distinguished inoffensiveness only\ndeepened the infelicity of Christina’s situation by depriving her\ndefiant attitude of the sanction of relative justice. So long as she had\nbeen free to choose, she had esteemed him: but from the moment she was\nforced to marry him she had detested him. Rowland read in the young\nman’s elastic Italian mask a profound consciousness of all this; and\nas he found there also a record of other curious things--of pride, of\ntemper, of bigotry, of an immense heritage of more or less aggressive\ntraditions--he reflected that the matrimonial conjunction of his two\ncompanions might be sufficiently prolific in incident.\n\n“You are going to Naples?” Rowland said to the prince by way of\nconversation.\n\n“We are going to Paris,” Christina interposed, slowly and softly.\n“We are going to London. We are going to Vienna. We are going to St.\nPetersburg.”\n\nPrince Casamassima dropped his eyes and fretted the earth with the point\nof his umbrella. While he engaged Rowland’s attention Christina turned\naway. When Rowland glanced at her again he saw a change pass over her\nface; she was observing something that was concealed from his own eyes\nby the angle of the church-wall. In a moment Roderick stepped into\nsight.\n\nHe stopped short, astonished; his face and figure were jaded, his\ngarments dusty. He looked at Christina from head to foot, and then,\nslowly, his cheek flushed and his eye expanded. Christina returned his\ngaze, and for some moments there was a singular silence. “You don’t look\nwell!” Christina said at last.\n\nRoderick answered nothing; he only looked and looked, as if she had been\na statue. “You are no less beautiful!” he presently cried.\n\nShe turned away with a smile, and stood a while gazing down the valley;\nRoderick stared at Prince Casamassima. Christina then put out her hand\nto Rowland. “Farewell,” she said. “If you are near me in future,\ndon’t try to see me!” And then, after a pause, in a lower tone, “I was\nsincere!” She addressed herself again to Roderick and asked him some\ncommonplace about his walk. But he said nothing; he only looked at\nher. Rowland at first had expected an outbreak of reproach, but it was\nevident that the danger was every moment diminishing. He was forgetting\neverything but her beauty, and as she stood there and let him feast upon\nit, Rowland was sure that she knew it. “I won’t say farewell to you,”\n she said; “we shall meet again!” And she moved gravely away. Prince\nCasamassima took leave courteously of Rowland; upon Roderick he bestowed\na bow of exaggerated civility. Roderick appeared not to see it; he\nwas still watching Christina, as she passed over the grass. His eyes\nfollowed her until she reached the door of her inn. Here she stopped and\nlooked back at him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Switzerland\n\nOn the homeward walk, that evening, Roderick preserved a silence which\nRowland allowed to make him uneasy. Early on the morrow Roderick,\nsaying nothing of his intentions, started off on a walk; Rowland saw\nhim striding with light steps along the rugged path to Engelberg. He was\nabsent all day and he gave no account of himself on his return. He said\nhe was deadly tired, and he went to bed early. When he had left the room\nMiss Garland drew near to Rowland.\n\n“I wish to ask you a question,” she said. “What happened to Roderick\nyesterday at Engelberg?”\n\n“You have discovered that something happened?” Rowland answered.\n\n“I am sure of it. Was it something painful?”\n\n“I don’t know how, at the present moment, he judges it. He met the\nPrincess Casamassima.”\n\n“Thank you!” said Miss Garland, simply, and turned away.\n\nThe conversation had been brief, but, like many small things, it\nfurnished Rowland with food for reflection. When one is looking for\nsymptoms one easily finds them. This was the first time Mary Garland had\nasked Rowland a question which it was in Roderick’s power to answer,\nthe first time she had frankly betrayed Roderick’s reticence. Rowland\nventured to think it marked an era.\n\nThe next morning was sultry, and the air, usually so fresh at those\naltitudes, was oppressively heavy. Rowland lounged on the grass a while,\nnear Singleton, who was at work under his white umbrella, within view of\nthe house; and then in quest of coolness he wandered away to the rocky\nridge whence you looked across at the Jungfrau. To-day, however, the\nwhite summits were invisible; their heads were muffled in sullen clouds\nand the valleys beneath them curtained in dun-colored mist. Rowland had\na book in his pocket, and he took it out and opened it. But his page\nremained unturned; his own thoughts were more importunate. His interview\nwith Christina Light had made a great impression upon him, and he was\nhaunted with the memory of her almost blameless bitterness, and of all\nthat was tragic and fatal in her latest transformation. These things\nwere immensely appealing, and Rowland thought with infinite impatience\nof Roderick’s having again encountered them. It required little\nimagination to apprehend that the young sculptor’s condition had\nalso appealed to Christina. His consummate indifference, his supreme\ndefiance, would make him a magnificent trophy, and Christina had\nannounced with sufficient distinctness that she had said good-by to\nscruples. It was her fancy at present to treat the world as a garden of\npleasure, and if, hitherto, she had played with Roderick’s passion on\nits stem, there was little doubt that now she would pluck it with an\nunfaltering hand and drain it of its acrid sweetness. And why the\ndeuce need Roderick have gone marching back to destruction? Rowland’s\nmeditations, even when they began in rancor, often brought him peace;\nbut on this occasion they ushered in a quite peculiar quality of unrest.\nHe felt conscious of a sudden collapse in his moral energy; a current\nthat had been flowing for two years with liquid strength seemed at last\nto pause and evaporate. Rowland looked away at the stagnant vapors on\nthe mountains; their dreariness seemed a symbol of the dreariness which\nhis own generosity had bequeathed him. At last he had arrived at the\nuttermost limit of the deference a sane man might pay to other people’s\nfolly; nay, rather, he had transgressed it; he had been befooled on a\ngigantic scale. He turned to his book and tried to woo back patience,\nbut it gave him cold comfort and he tossed it angrily away. He pulled\nhis hat over his eyes, and tried to wonder, dispassionately, whether\natmospheric conditions had not something to do with his ill-humor. He\nremained for some time in this attitude, but was finally aroused from\nit by a singular sense that, although he had heard nothing, some one had\napproached him. He looked up and saw Roderick standing before him on the\nturf. His mood made the spectacle unwelcome, and for a moment he felt\nlike uttering an uncivil speech. Roderick stood looking at him with an\nexpression of countenance which had of late become rare. There was an\nunfamiliar spark in his eye and a certain imperious alertness in his\ncarriage. Confirmed habit, with Rowland, came speedily to the front.\n“What is it now?” he asked himself, and invited Roderick to sit down.\nRoderick had evidently something particular to say, and if he remained\nsilent for a time it was not because he was ashamed of it.\n\n“I would like you to do me a favor,” he said at last. “Lend me some\nmoney.”\n\n“How much do you wish?” Rowland asked.\n\n“Say a thousand francs.”\n\nRowland hesitated a moment. “I don’t wish to be indiscreet, but may I\nask what you propose to do with a thousand francs?”\n\n“To go to Interlaken.”\n\n“And why are you going to Interlaken?”\n\nRoderick replied without a shadow of wavering, “Because that woman is to\nbe there.”\n\nRowland burst out laughing, but Roderick remained serenely grave. “You\nhave forgiven her, then?” said Rowland.\n\n“Not a bit of it!”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Neither do I. I only know that she is incomparably beautiful, and that\nshe has waked me up amazingly. Besides, she asked me to come.”\n\n“She asked you?”\n\n“Yesterday, in so many words.”\n\n“Ah, the jade!”\n\n“Exactly. I am willing to take her for that.”\n\n“Why in the name of common sense did you go back to her?”\n\n“Why did I find her standing there like a goddess who had just stepped\nout of her cloud? Why did I look at her? Before I knew where I was, the\nharm was done.”\n\nRowland, who had been sitting erect, threw himself back on the grass and\nlay for some time staring up at the sky. At last, raising himself, “Are\nyou perfectly serious?” he asked.\n\n“Deadly serious.”\n\n“Your idea is to remain at Interlaken some time?”\n\n“Indefinitely!” said Roderick; and it seemed to his companion that the\ntone in which he said this made it immensely well worth hearing.\n\n“And your mother and cousin, meanwhile, are to remain here? It will soon\nbe getting very cold, you know.”\n\n“It does n’t seem much like it to-day.”\n\n“Very true; but to-day is a day by itself.”\n\n“There is nothing to prevent their going back to Lucerne. I depend upon\nyour taking charge of them.”\n\nAt this Rowland reclined upon the grass again; and again, after\nreflection, he faced his friend. “How would you express,” he asked, “the\ncharacter of the profit that you expect to derive from your excursion?”\n\n“I see no need of expressing it. The proof of the pudding is in the\neating! The case is simply this. I desire immensely to be near Christina\nLight, and it is such a huge refreshment to find myself again desiring\nsomething, that I propose to drift with the current. As I say, she has\nwaked me up, and it is possible something may come of it. She makes me\nfeel as if I were alive again. This,” and he glanced down at the inn, “I\ncall death!”\n\n“That I am very grateful to hear. You really feel as if you might do\nsomething?”\n\n“Don’t ask too much. I only know that she makes my heart beat, makes me\nsee visions.”\n\n“You feel encouraged?”\n\n“I feel excited.”\n\n“You are really looking better.”\n\n“I am glad to hear it. Now that I have answered your questions, please\nto give me the money.”\n\nRowland shook his head. “For that purpose, I can’t!”\n\n“You can’t?”\n\n“It ‘s impossible. Your plan is rank folly. I can’t help you in it.”\n\nRoderick flushed a little, and his eye expanded. “I will borrow what\nmoney I can, then, from Mary!” This was not viciously said; it had\nsimply the ring of passionate resolution.\n\nInstantly it brought Rowland to terms. He took a bunch of keys from\nhis pocket and tossed it upon the grass. “The little brass one opens my\ndressing-case,” he said. “You will find money in it.”\n\nRoderick let the keys lie; something seemed to have struck him; he\nlooked askance at his friend. “You are awfully gallant!”\n\n“You certainly are not. Your proposal is an outrage.”\n\n“Very likely. It ‘s a proof the more of my desire.”\n\n“If you have so much steam on, then, use it for something else. You say\nyou are awake again. I am delighted; only be so in the best sense. Is\nn’t it very plain? If you have the energy to desire, you have also the\nenergy to reason and to judge. If you can care to go, you can also care\nto stay, and staying being the more profitable course, the inspiration,\non that side, for a man who has his self-confidence to win back again,\nshould be greater.”\n\nRoderick, plainly, did not relish this simple logic, and his eye grew\nangry as he listened to its echo. “Oh, the devil!” he cried.\n\nRowland went on. “Do you believe that hanging about Christina Light will\ndo you any good? Do you believe it won’t? In either case you should keep\naway from her. If it won’t, it ‘s your duty; and if it will, you can get\non without it.”\n\n“Do me good?” cried Roderick. “What do I want of ‘good’--what should I\ndo with ‘good’? I want what she gives me, call it by what name you will.\nI want to ask no questions, but to take what comes and let it fill the\nimpossible hours! But I did n’t come to discuss the matter.”\n\n“I have not the least desire to discuss it,” said Rowland. “I simply\nprotest.”\n\nRoderick meditated a moment. “I have never yet thought twice of\naccepting a favor of you,” he said at last; “but this one sticks in my\nthroat.”\n\n“It is not a favor; I lend you the money only under compulsion.”\n\n“Well, then, I will take it only under compulsion!” Roderick exclaimed.\nAnd he sprang up abruptly and marched away.\n\nHis words were ambiguous; Rowland lay on the grass, wondering what they\nmeant. Half an hour had not elapsed before Roderick reappeared, heated\nwith rapid walking, and wiping his forehead. He flung himself down and\nlooked at his friend with an eye which expressed something purer than\nbravado and yet baser than conviction.\n\n“I have done my best!” he said. “My mother is out of money; she is\nexpecting next week some circular notes from London. She had only ten\nfrancs in her pocket. Mary Garland gave me every sou she possessed in\nthe world. It makes exactly thirty-four francs. That ‘s not enough.”\n\n“You asked Miss Garland?” cried Rowland.\n\n“I asked her.”\n\n“And told her your purpose?”\n\n“I named no names. But she knew!”\n\n“What did she say?”\n\n“Not a syllable. She simply emptied her purse.”\n\nRowland turned over and buried his face in his arms. He felt a movement\nof irrepressible elation, and he barely stifled a cry of joy. Now,\nsurely, Roderick had shattered the last link in the chain that bound\nMary to him, and after this she would be free!... When he turned about\nagain, Roderick was still sitting there, and he had not touched the keys\nwhich lay on the grass.\n\n“I don’t know what is the matter with me,” said Roderick, “but I have an\ninsurmountable aversion to taking your money.”\n\n“The matter, I suppose, is that you have a grain of wisdom left.”\n\n“No, it ‘s not that. It ‘s a kind of brute instinct. I find it extremely\nprovoking!” He sat there for some time with his head in his hands and\nhis eyes on the ground. His lips were compressed, and he was evidently,\nin fact, in a state of profound irritation. “You have succeeded in\nmaking this thing excessively unpleasant!” he exclaimed.\n\n“I am sorry,” said Rowland, “but I can’t see it in any other way.”\n\n“That I believe, and I resent the range of your vision pretending to\nbe the limit of my action. You can’t feel for me nor judge for me, and\nthere are certain things you know nothing about. I have suffered, sir!”\n Roderick went on with increasing emphasis. “I have suffered damnable\ntorments. Have I been such a placid, contented, comfortable man this\nlast six months, that when I find a chance to forget my misery, I should\ntake such pains not to profit by it? You ask too much, for a man who\nhimself has no occasion to play the hero. I don’t say that invidiously;\nit ‘s your disposition, and you can’t help it. But decidedly, there are\ncertain things you know nothing about.”\n\nRowland listened to this outbreak with open eyes, and Roderick, if\nhe had been less intent upon his own eloquence, would probably have\nperceived that he turned pale. “These things--what are they?” Rowland\nasked.\n\n“They are women, principally, and what relates to women. Women for\nyou, by what I can make out, mean nothing. You have no imagination--no\nsensibility!”\n\n“That ‘s a serious charge,” said Rowland, gravely.\n\n“I don’t make it without proof!”\n\n“And what is your proof?”\n\nRoderick hesitated a moment. “The way you treated Christina Light. I\ncall that grossly obtuse.”\n\n“Obtuse?” Rowland repeated, frowning.\n\n“Thick-skinned, beneath your good fortune.”\n\n“My good fortune?”\n\n“There it is--it ‘s all news to you! You had pleased her. I don’t say\nshe was dying of love for you, but she took a fancy to you.”\n\n“We will let this pass!” said Rowland, after a silence.\n\n“Oh, I don’t insist. I have only her own word for it.”\n\n“She told you this?”\n\n“You noticed, at least, I suppose, that she was not afraid to speak. I\nnever repeated it, not because I was jealous, but because I was curious\nto see how long your ignorance would last if left to itself.”\n\n“I frankly confess it would have lasted forever. And yet I don’t\nconsider that my insensibility is proved.”\n\n“Oh, don’t say that,” cried Roderick, “or I shall begin to suspect--what\nI must do you the justice to say that I never have suspected--that you\nare a trifle conceited. Upon my word, when I think of all this, your\nprotest, as you call it, against my following Christina Light seems\nto me thoroughly offensive. There is something monstrous in a man’s\npretending to lay down the law to a sort of emotion with which he is\nquite unacquainted--in his asking a fellow to give up a lovely woman for\nconscience’ sake, when he has never had the impulse to strike a blow for\none for passion’s!”\n\n“Oh, oh!” cried Rowland.\n\n“All that ‘s very easy to say,” Roderick went on; “but you must remember\nthat there are such things as nerves, and senses, and imagination, and\na restless demon within that may sleep sometimes for a day, or for six\nmonths, but that sooner or later wakes up and thumps at your ribs till\nyou listen to him! If you can’t understand it, take it on trust, and let\na poor imaginative devil live his life as he can!”\n\nRoderick’s words seemed at first to Rowland like something heard in a\ndream; it was impossible they had been actually spoken--so supreme an\nexpression were they of the insolence of egotism. Reality was never so\nconsistent as that! But Roderick sat there balancing his beautiful\nhead, and the echoes of his strident accent still lingered along the\nhalf-muffled mountain-side. Rowland suddenly felt that the cup of his\nchagrin was full to overflowing, and his long-gathered bitterness surged\ninto the simple, wholesome passion of anger for wasted kindness. But\nhe spoke without violence, and Roderick was probably at first far from\nmeasuring the force that lay beneath his words.\n\n“You are incredibly ungrateful,” he said. “You are talking arrogant\nnonsense. What do you know about my sensibilities and my imagination?\nHow do you know whether I have loved or suffered? If I have held my\ntongue and not troubled you with my complaints, you find it the most\nnatural thing in the world to put an ignoble construction on my silence.\nI loved quite as well as you; indeed, I think I may say rather better. I\nhave been constant. I have been willing to give more than I received. I\nhave not forsaken one mistress because I thought another more beautiful,\nnor given up the other and believed all manner of evil about her because\nI had not my way with her. I have been a good friend to Christina Light,\nand it seems to me my friendship does her quite as much honor as your\nlove!”\n\n“Your love--your suffering--your silence--your friendship!” cried\nRoderick. “I declare I don’t understand!”\n\n“I dare say not. You are not used to understanding such things--you are\nnot used to hearing me talk of my feelings. You are altogether too\nmuch taken up with your own. Be as much so as you please; I have always\nrespected your right. Only when I have kept myself in durance on purpose\nto leave you an open field, don’t, by way of thanking me, come and call\nme an idiot.”\n\n“Oh, you claim then that you have made sacrifices?”\n\n“Several! You have never suspected it?”\n\n“If I had, do you suppose I would have allowed it?” cried Roderick.\n\n“They were the sacrifices of friendship and they were easily made; only\nI don’t enjoy having them thrown back in my teeth.”\n\nThis was, under the circumstances, a sufficiently generous speech; but\nRoderick was not in the humor to take it generously. “Come, be more\ndefinite,” he said. “Let me know where it is the shoe has pinched.”\n\nRowland frowned; if Roderick would not take generosity, he should have\nfull justice. “It ‘s a perpetual sacrifice,” he said, “to live with a\nperfect egotist.”\n\n“I am an egotist?” cried Roderick.\n\n“Did it never occur to you?”\n\n“An egotist to whom you have made perpetual sacrifices?” He repeated\nthe words in a singular tone; a tone that denoted neither exactly\nindignation nor incredulity, but (strange as it may seem) a sudden\nviolent curiosity for news about himself.\n\n“You are selfish,” said Rowland; “you think only of yourself and believe\nonly in yourself. You regard other people only as they play into your\nown hands. You have always been very frank about it, and the thing\nseemed so mixed up with the temper of your genius and the very structure\nof your mind, that often one was willing to take the evil with the good\nand to be thankful that, considering your great talent, you were no\nworse. But if one believed in you, as I have done, one paid a tax upon\nit.”\n\nRoderick leaned his elbows on his knees, clasped his hands together, and\ncrossed them, shadewise, over his eyes. In this attitude, for a\nmoment, he sat looking coldly at his friend. “So I have made you very\nuncomfortable?” he went on.\n\n“Extremely so.”\n\n“I have been eager, grasping, obstinate, vain, ungrateful, indifferent,\ncruel?”\n\n“I have accused you, mentally, of all these things, with the exception\nof vanity.”\n\n“You have often hated me?”\n\n“Never. I should have parted company with you before coming to that.”\n\n“But you have wanted to part company, to bid me go my way and be\nhanged!”\n\n“Repeatedly. Then I have had patience and forgiven you.”\n\n“Forgiven me, eh? Suffering all the while?”\n\n“Yes, you may call it suffering.”\n\n“Why did you never tell me all this before?”\n\n“Because my affection was always stronger than my resentment; because\nI preferred to err on the side of kindness; because I had, myself, in a\nmeasure, launched you in the world and thrown you into temptations; and\nbecause nothing short of your unwarrantable aggression just now could\nhave made me say these painful things.”\n\nRoderick picked up a blade of long grass and began to bite it; Rowland\nwas puzzled by his expression and manner. They seemed strangely cynical;\nthere was something revolting in his deepening calmness. “I must have\nbeen hideous,” Roderick presently resumed.\n\n“I am not talking for your entertainment,” said Rowland.\n\n“Of course not. For my edification!” As Roderick said these words there\nwas not a ray of warmth in his brilliant eye.\n\n“I have spoken for my own relief,” Rowland went on, “and so that you\nneed never again go so utterly astray as you have done this morning.”\n\n“It has been a terrible mistake, then?” What his tone expressed was not\nwillful mockery, but a kind of persistent irresponsibility which Rowland\nfound equally exasperating. He answered nothing.\n\n“And all this time,” Roderick continued, “you have been in love? Tell me\nthe woman.”\n\nRowland felt an immense desire to give him a visible, palpable pang.\n“Her name is Mary Garland,” he said.\n\nApparently he succeeded. The surprise was great; Roderick colored as he\nhad never done. “Mary Garland? Heaven forgive us!”\n\nRowland observed the “us;” Roderick threw himself back on the turf. The\nlatter lay for some time staring at the sky. At last he sprang to his\nfeet, and Rowland rose also, rejoicing keenly, it must be confessed, in\nhis companion’s confusion.\n\n“For how long has this been?” Roderick demanded.\n\n“Since I first knew her.”\n\n“Two years! And you have never told her?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“You have told no one?”\n\n“You are the first person.”\n\n“Why have you been silent?”\n\n“Because of your engagement.”\n\n“But you have done your best to keep that up.”\n\n“That ‘s another matter!”\n\n“It ‘s very strange!” said Roderick, presently. “It ‘s like something in\na novel.”\n\n“We need n’t expatiate on it,” said Rowland. “All I wished to do was to\nrebut your charge that I am an abnormal being.”\n\nBut still Roderick pondered. “All these months, while I was going on! I\nwish you had mentioned it.”\n\n“I acted as was necessary, and that ‘s the end of it.”\n\n“You have a very high opinion of her?”\n\n“The highest.”\n\n“I remember now your occasionally expressing it and my being struck with\nit. But I never dreamed you were in love with her. It ‘s a pity she does\nn’t care for you!”\n\nRowland had made his point and he had no wish to prolong the\nconversation; but he had a desire to hear more of this, and he remained\nsilent.\n\n“You hope, I suppose, that some day she may?”\n\n“I should n’t have offered to say so; but since you ask me, I do.”\n\n“I don’t believe it. She idolizes me, and if she never were to see me\nagain she would idolize my memory.”\n\nThis might be profound insight, and it might be profound fatuity.\nRowland turned away; he could not trust himself to speak.\n\n“My indifference, my neglect of her, must have seemed to you horrible.\nAltogether, I must have appeared simply hideous.”\n\n“Do you really care,” Rowland asked, “what you appeared?”\n\n“Certainly. I have been damnably stupid. Is n’t an artist supposed to be\na man of perceptions? I am hugely disgusted.”\n\n“Well, you understand now, and we can start afresh.”\n\n“And yet,” said Roderick, “though you have suffered, in a degree, I\ndon’t believe you have suffered so much as some other men would have\ndone.”\n\n“Very likely not. In such matters quantitative analysis is difficult.”\n\nRoderick picked up his stick and stood looking at the ground.\n“Nevertheless, I must have seemed hideous,” he repeated--“hideous.” He\nturned away, scowling, and Rowland offered no contradiction.\n\nThey were both silent for some time, and at last Roderick gave a heavy\nsigh and began to walk away. “Where are you going?” Rowland then asked.\n\n“Oh, I don’t care! To walk; you have given me something to think\nof.” This seemed a salutary impulse, and yet Rowland felt a nameless\nperplexity. “To have been so stupid damns me more than anything!”\n Roderick went on. “Certainly, I can shut up shop now.”\n\nRowland felt in no smiling humor, and yet, in spite of himself, he could\nalmost have smiled at the very consistency of the fellow. It was egotism\nstill: aesthetic disgust at the graceless contour of his conduct, but\nnever a hint of simple sorrow for the pain he had given. Rowland let\nhim go, and for some moments stood watching him. Suddenly Mallet became\nconscious of a singular and most illogical impulse--a desire to stop\nhim, to have another word with him--not to lose sight of him. He called\nhim and Roderick turned. “I should like to go with you,” said Rowland.\n\n“I am fit only to be alone. I am damned!”\n\n“You had better not think of it at all,” Rowland cried, “than think in\nthat way.”\n\n“There is only one way. I have been hideous!” And he broke off and\nmarched away with his long, elastic step, swinging his stick. Rowland\nwatched him and at the end of a moment called to him. Roderick stopped\nand looked at him in silence, and then abruptly turned, and disappeared\nbelow the crest of a hill.\n\nRowland passed the remainder of the day uncomfortably. He was half\nirritated, half depressed; he had an insufferable feeling of having been\nplaced in the wrong, in spite of his excellent cause. Roderick did not\ncome home to dinner; but of this, with his passion for brooding away the\nhours on far-off mountain sides, he had almost made a habit. Mrs. Hudson\nappeared at the noonday repast with a face which showed that Roderick’s\ndemand for money had unsealed the fountains of her distress. Little\nSingleton consumed an enormous and well-earned dinner. Miss Garland,\nRowland observed, had not contributed her scanty assistance to her\nkinsman’s pursuit of the Princess Casamassima without an effort. The\neffort was visible in her pale face and her silence; she looked so ill\nthat when they left the table Rowland felt almost bound to remark upon\nit. They had come out upon the grass in front of the inn.\n\n“I have a headache,” she said. And then suddenly, looking about at the\nmenacing sky and motionless air, “It ‘s this horrible day!”\n\nRowland that afternoon tried to write a letter to his cousin Cecilia,\nbut his head and his heart were alike heavy, and he traced upon the\npaper but a single line. “I believe there is such a thing as being too\nreasonable. But when once the habit is formed, what is one to do?” He\nhad occasion to use his keys and he felt for them in his pocket; they\nwere missing, and he remembered that he had left them lying on the\nhill-top where he had had his talk with Roderick. He went forth in\nsearch of them and found them where he had thrown them. He flung\nhimself down in the same place again; he felt indisposed to walk. He\nwas conscious that his mood had vastly changed since the morning;\nhis extraordinary, acute sense of his rights had been replaced by the\nfamiliar, chronic sense of his duties. Only, his duties now seemed\nimpracticable; he turned over and buried his face in his arms. He lay\nso a long time, thinking of many things; the sum of them all was that\nRoderick had beaten him. At last he was startled by an extraordinary\nsound; it took him a moment to perceive that it was a portentous growl\nof thunder. He roused himself and saw that the whole face of the sky had\naltered. The clouds that had hung motionless all day were moving from\ntheir stations, and getting into position, as it were, for a battle. The\nwind was rising; the sallow vapors were turning dark and consolidating\ntheir masses. It was a striking spectacle, but Rowland judged best to\nobserve it briefly, as a storm was evidently imminent. He took his way\ndown to the inn and found Singleton still at his post, profiting by the\nlast of the rapidly-failing light to finish his study, and yet at the\nsame time taking rapid notes of the actual condition of the clouds.\n\n“We are going to have a most interesting storm,” the little painter\ngleefully cried. “I should like awfully to do it.”\n\nRowland adjured him to pack up his tools and decamp, and repaired to\nthe house. The air by this time had become portentously dark, and the\nthunder was incessant and tremendous; in the midst of it the lightning\nflashed and vanished, like the treble shrilling upon the bass. The\ninnkeeper and his servants had crowded to the doorway, and were looking\nat the scene with faces which seemed a proof that it was unprecedented.\nAs Rowland approached, the group divided, to let some one pass from\nwithin, and Mrs. Hudson came forth, as white as a corpse and trembling\nin every limb.\n\n“My boy, my boy, where is my boy?” she cried. “Mr. Mallet, why are you\nhere without him? Bring him to me!”\n\n“Has no one seen Mr. Hudson?” Rowland asked of the others. “Has he not\nreturned?”\n\nEach one shook his head and looked grave, and Rowland attempted to\nreassure Mrs. Hudson by saying that of course he had taken refuge in a\nchalet.\n\n“Go and find him, go and find him!” she cried, insanely. “Don’t stand\nthere and talk, or I shall die!” It was now as dark as evening, and\nRowland could just distinguish the figure of Singleton scampering\nhomeward with his box and easel. “And where is Mary?” Mrs. Hudson went\non; “what in mercy’s name has become of her? Mr. Mallet, why did you\never bring us here?”\n\nThere came a prodigious flash of lightning, and the limitless tumult\nabout them turned clearer than midsummer noonday. The brightness lasted\nlong enough to enable Rowland to see a woman’s figure on the top of\nan eminence near the house. It was Mary Garland, questioning the lurid\ndarkness for Roderick. Rowland sprang out to interrupt her vigil, but in\na moment he encountered her, retreating. He seized her hand and hurried\nher to the house, where, as soon as she stepped into the covered\ngallery, Mrs. Hudson fell upon her with frantic lamentations.\n\n“Did you see nothing,--nothing?” she cried. “Tell Mr. Mallet he must go\nand find him, with some men, some lights, some wrappings. Go, go, go,\nsir! In mercy, go!”\n\nRowland was extremely perturbed by the poor lady’s vociferous folly, for\nhe deemed her anxiety superfluous. He had offered his suggestion with\nsincerity; nothing was more probable than that Roderick had found\nshelter in a herdsman’s cabin. These were numerous on the neighboring\nmountains, and the storm had given fair warning of its approach. Miss\nGarland stood there very pale, saying nothing, but looking at him. He\nexpected that she would check her cousin’s importunity. “Could you find\nhim?” she suddenly asked. “Would it be of use?”\n\nThe question seemed to him a flash intenser than the lightning that was\nraking the sky before them. It shattered his dream that he weighed in\nthe scale! But before he could answer, the full fury of the storm was\nupon them; the rain descended in sounding torrents. Every one fell back\ninto the house. There had been no time to light lamps, and in the little\nuncarpeted parlor, in the unnatural darkness, Rowland felt Mary’s hand\nupon his arm. For a moment it had an eloquent pressure; it seemed to\nretract her senseless challenge, and to say that she believed, for\nRoderick, what he believed. But nevertheless, thought Rowland, the cry\nhad come, her heart had spoken; her first impulse had been to sacrifice\nhim. He had been uncertain before; here, at least, was the comfort of\ncertainty!\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that the certainty in question did little\nto enliven the gloom of that formidable evening. There was a noisy\ncrowd about him in the room--noisy even with the accompaniment of the\ncontinual thunder-peals; lodgers and servants, chattering, shuffling,\nand bustling, and annoying him equally by making too light of the\ntempest and by vociferating their alarm. In the disorder, it was some\ntime before a lamp was lighted, and the first thing he saw, as it was\nswung from the ceiling, was the white face of Mrs. Hudson, who was being\ncarried out of the room in a swoon by two stout maid-servants, with Mary\nGarland forcing a passage. He rendered what help he could, but when they\nhad laid the poor woman on her bed, Miss Garland motioned him away.\n\n“I think you make her worse,” she said.\n\nRowland went to his own chamber. The partitions in Swiss mountain-inns\nare thin, and from time to time he heard Mrs. Hudson moaning, three\nrooms off. Considering its great fury, the storm took long to expend\nitself; it was upwards of three hours before the thunder ceased. But\neven then the rain continued to fall heavily, and the night, which had\ncome on, was impenetrably black. This lasted till near midnight. Rowland\nthought of Mary Garland’s challenge in the porch, but he thought even\nmore that, although the fetid interior of a high-nestling chalet may\noffer a convenient refuge from an Alpine tempest, there was no possible\nmusic in the universe so sweet as the sound of Roderick’s voice. At\nmidnight, through his dripping window-pane, he saw a star, and he\nimmediately went downstairs and out into the gallery. The rain had\nceased, the cloud-masses were dissevered here and there, and several\nstars were visible. In a few minutes he heard a step behind him, and,\nturning, saw Miss Garland. He asked about Mrs. Hudson and learned that\nshe was sleeping, exhausted by her fruitless lamentations. Miss Garland\nkept scanning the darkness, but she said nothing to cast doubt on\nRoderick’s having found a refuge. Rowland noticed it. “This also have I\nguaranteed!” he said to himself. There was something that Mary wished to\nlearn, and a question presently revealed it.\n\n“What made him start on a long walk so suddenly?” she asked. “I saw him\nat eleven o’clock, and then he meant to go to Engelberg, and sleep.”\n\n“On his way to Interlaken?” Rowland said.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, under cover of the darkness.\n\n“We had some talk,” said Rowland, “and he seemed, for the day, to have\ngiven up Interlaken.”\n\n“Did you dissuade him?”\n\n“Not exactly. We discussed another question, which, for the time,\nsuperseded his plan.”\n\nMiss Garland was silent. Then--“May I ask whether your discussion was\nviolent?” she said.\n\n“I am afraid it was agreeable to neither of us.”\n\n“And Roderick left you in--in irritation?”\n\n“I offered him my company on his walk. He declined it.”\n\nMiss Garland paced slowly to the end of the gallery and then came back.\n“If he had gone to Engelberg,” she said, “he would have reached the\nhotel before the storm began.”\n\nRowland felt a sudden explosion of ferocity. “Oh, if you like,” he\ncried, “he can start for Interlaken as soon as he comes back!”\n\nBut she did not even notice his wrath. “Will he come back early?” she\nwent on.\n\n“We may suppose so.”\n\n“He will know how anxious we are, and he will start with the first\nlight!”\n\nRowland was on the point of declaring that Roderick’s readiness to throw\nhimself into the feelings of others made this extremely probable; but he\nchecked himself and said, simply, “I expect him at sunrise.”\n\nMiss Garland bent her eyes once more upon the irresponsive darkness, and\nthen, in silence, went into the house. Rowland, it must be averred, in\nspite of his resolution not to be nervous, found no sleep that night.\nWhen the early dawn began to tremble in the east, he came forth again\ninto the open air. The storm had completely purged the atmosphere, and\nthe day gave promise of cloudless splendor. Rowland watched the early\nsun-shafts slowly reaching higher, and remembered that if Roderick\ndid not come back to breakfast, there were two things to be taken\ninto account. One was the heaviness of the soil on the mountain-sides,\nsaturated with the rain; this would make him walk slowly: the other\nwas the fact that, speaking without irony, he was not remarkable for\nthrowing himself into the sentiments of others. Breakfast, at the inn,\nwas early, and by breakfast-time Roderick had not appeared. Then Rowland\nadmitted that he was nervous. Neither Mrs. Hudson nor Miss Garland had\nleft their apartment; Rowland had a mental vision of them sitting there\npraying and listening; he had no desire to see them more directly. There\nwere a couple of men who hung about the inn as guides for the ascent of\nthe Titlis; Rowland sent each of them forth in a different direction,\nto ask the news of Roderick at every chalet door within a morning’s\nwalk. Then he called Sam Singleton, whose peregrinations had made him an\nexcellent mountaineer, and whose zeal and sympathy were now unbounded,\nand the two started together on a voyage of research. By the time\nthey had lost sight of the inn, Rowland was obliged to confess that,\ndecidedly, Roderick had had time to come back.\n\nHe wandered about for several hours, but he found only the sunny\nstillness of the mountain-sides. Before long he parted company with\nSingleton, who, to his suggestion that separation would multiply their\nresources, assented with a silent, frightened look which reflected too\nvividly his own rapidly-dawning thought. The day was magnificent; the\nsun was everywhere; the storm had lashed the lower slopes into a deeper\nflush of autumnal color, and the snow-peaks reared themselves against\nthe near horizon in glaring blocks and dazzling spires. Rowland made his\nway to several chalets, but most of them were empty. He thumped at their\nlow, foul doors with a kind of nervous, savage anger; he challenged the\nstupid silence to tell him something about his friend. Some of these\nplaces had evidently not been open in months. The silence everywhere\nwas horrible; it seemed to mock at his impatience and to be a conscious\nsymbol of calamity. In the midst of it, at the door of one of the\nchalets, quite alone, sat a hideous cretin, who grinned at Rowland over\nhis goitre when, hardly knowing what he did, he questioned him. The\ncreature’s family was scattered on the mountain-sides; he could give\nRowland no help to find them. Rowland climbed into many awkward\nplaces, and skirted, intently and peeringly, many an ugly chasm and\nsteep-dropping ledge. But the sun, as I have said, was everywhere; it\nillumined the deep places over which, not knowing where to turn next,\nhe halted and lingered, and showed him nothing but the stony Alpine\nvoid--nothing so human even as death. At noon he paused in his quest and\nsat down on a stone; the conviction was pressing upon him that the worst\nthat was now possible was true. He suspended his search; he was afraid\nto go on. He sat there for an hour, sick to the depths of his soul.\nWithout his knowing why, several things, chiefly trivial, that had\nhappened during the last two years and that he had quite forgotten,\nbecame vividly present to his mind. He was aroused at last by the sound\nof a stone dislodged near by, which rattled down the mountain. In a\nmoment, on a steep, rocky slope opposite to him, he beheld a figure\ncautiously descending--a figure which was not Roderick. It was\nSingleton, who had seen him and began to beckon to him.\n\n“Come down--come down!” cried the painter, steadily making his own way\ndown. Rowland saw that as he moved, and even as he selected his foothold\nand watched his steps, he was looking at something at the bottom of the\ncliff. This was a great rugged wall which had fallen backward from\nthe perpendicular, and the descent, though difficult, was with care\nsufficiently practicable.\n\n“What do you see?” cried Rowland.\n\nSingleton stopped, looked across at him and seemed to hesitate; then,\n“Come down--come down!” he simply repeated.\n\nRowland’s course was also a steep descent, and he attacked it so\nprecipitately that he afterwards marveled he had not broken his neck.\nIt was a ten minutes’ headlong scramble. Half-way down he saw something\nthat made him dizzy; he saw what Singleton had seen. In the gorge below\nthem a vague white mass lay tumbled upon the stones. He let himself go,\nblindly, fiercely. Singleton had reached the rocky bottom of the ravine\nbefore him, and had bounded forward and fallen upon his knees. Rowland\novertook him and his own legs collapsed. The thing that yesterday was\nhis friend lay before him as the chance of the last breath had left it,\nand out of it Roderick’s face stared upward, open-eyed, at the sky.\n\nHe had fallen from a great height, but he was singularly little\ndisfigured. The rain had spent its torrents upon him, and his clothes\nand hair were as wet as if the billows of the ocean had flung him upon\nthe strand. An attempt to move him would show some hideous fracture,\nsome horrible physical dishonor; but what Rowland saw on first looking\nat him was only a strangely serene expression of life. The eyes were\ndead, but in a short time, when Rowland had closed them, the whole\nface seemed to awake. The rain had washed away all blood; it was as if\nViolence, having done her work, had stolen away in shame. Roderick’s\nface might have shamed her; it looked admirably handsome.\n\n“He was a beautiful man!” said Singleton.\n\nThey looked up through their horror at the cliff from which he had\napparently fallen, and which lifted its blank and stony face above\nhim, with no care now but to drink the sunshine on which his eyes were\nclosed, and then Rowland had an immense outbreak of pity and anguish. At\nlast they spoke of carrying him back to the inn. “There must be three or\nfour men,” Rowland said, “and they must be brought here quickly. I have\nnot the least idea where we are.”\n\n“We are at about three hours’ walk from home,” said Singleton. “I will\ngo for help; I can find my way.”\n\n“Remember,” said Rowland, “whom you will have to face.”\n\n“I remember,” the excellent fellow answered. “There was nothing I could\never do for him in life; I will do what I can now.”\n\nHe went off, and Rowland stayed there alone. He watched for seven long\nhours, and his vigil was forever memorable. The most rational of men was\nfor an hour the most passionate. He reviled himself with transcendent\nbitterness, he accused himself of cruelty and injustice, he would\nhave lain down there in Roderick’s place to unsay the words that had\nyesterday driven him forth on his lonely ramble. Roderick had been fond\nof saying that there are such things as necessary follies, and Rowland\nwas now proving it. At last he grew almost used to the dumb exultation\nof the cliff above him. He saw that Roderick was a mass of hideous\ninjury, and he tried to understand what had happened. Not that it helped\nhim; before that confounding mortality one hypothesis after another\nfaltered and swooned away. Roderick’s passionate walk had carried him\nfarther and higher than he knew; he had outstayed, supposably, the first\nmenace of the storm, and perhaps even found a defiant entertainment\nin watching it. Perhaps he had simply lost himself. The tempest had\novertaken him, and when he tried to return, it was too late. He\nhad attempted to descend the cliff in the darkness, he had made the\ninevitable slip, and whether he had fallen fifty feet or three hundred\nlittle mattered. The condition of his body indicated the shorter fall.\nNow that all was over, Rowland understood how exclusively, for two\nyears, Roderick had filled his life. His occupation was gone.\n\nSingleton came back with four men--one of them the landlord of the inn.\nThey had formed a sort of rude bier of the frame of a chaise a porteurs,\nand by taking a very round-about course homeward were able to follow a\ntolerably level path and carry their burden with a certain decency. To\nRowland it seemed as if the little procession would never reach the inn;\nbut as they drew near it he would have given his right hand for a longer\ndelay. The people of the inn came forward to meet them, in a little\nsilent, solemn convoy. In the doorway, clinging together, appeared the\ntwo bereaved women. Mrs. Hudson tottered forward with outstretched hands\nand the expression of a blind person; but before she reached her son,\nMary Garland had rushed past her, and, in the face of the staring,\npitying, awe-stricken crowd, had flung herself, with the magnificent\nmovement of one whose rights were supreme, and with a loud, tremendous\ncry, upon the senseless vestige of her love.\n\nThat cry still lives in Rowland’s ears. It interposes, persistently,\nagainst the reflection that when he sometimes--very rarely--sees her,\nshe is unreservedly kind to him; against the memory that during the\ndreary journey back to America, made of course with his assistance,\nthere was a great frankness in her gratitude, a great gratitude in her\nfrankness. Miss Garland lives with Mrs. Hudson, at Northampton, where\nRowland visits his cousin Cecilia more frequently than of old. When he\ncalls upon Miss Garland he never sees Mrs. Hudson. Cecilia, who, having\nher shrewd impression that he comes to see Miss Garland as much as to\nsee herself, does not feel obliged to seem unduly flattered, calls him,\nwhenever he reappears, the most restless of mortals. But he always says\nto her in answer, “No, I assure you I am the most patient!”"
