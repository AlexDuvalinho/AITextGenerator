Otherwise they would have remained scattered and hidden\nindefinitely in the hands of various collectors.  They will be found\nextraordinarily interesting in their self-revelation, and some, indeed,\nare so intimate and personal that one understands why Stevenson withheld\nthem from all eyes save his own.  The love-poems in particular, though\nthey are of very unequal merit, possess in common a really affecting\nsincerity.  That Stevenson should have preserved these poems through all\nthe vicissitudes of his wandering life shows how dearly he must have\nvalued them; and shows, too, I think, beyond any contradiction, that he\nmeant they should be ultimately published.\n\n                                                           LLOYD OSBOURNE.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n                                                          PAGE\nPRAYER                                                       1\nLO!

IN THINE HONEST EYES I READ\n\n\n   LO! in thine honest eyes I read\n   The auspicious beacon that shall lead,\n   After long sailing in deep seas,\n   To quiet havens in June ease.\n\n   Thy voice sings like an inland bird\n   First by the seaworn sailor heard;\n   And like road sheltered from life’s sea\n   Thine honest heart is unto me.\n\n\n\n\nTHOUGH DEEP INDIFFERENCE SHOULD DROWSE\n\n\n   THOUGH deep indifference should drowse\n   The sluggish life beneath my brows,\n   And all the external things I see\n   Grow snow-showers in the street to me,\n   Yet inmost in my stormy sense\n   Thy looks shall be an influence.\n\n   Though other loves may come and go\n   And long years sever us below,\n   Shall the thin ice that grows above\n   Freeze the deep centre-well of love?\n   No, still below light amours, thou\n   Shalt rule me as thou rul’st me now.\n\n   Year following year shall only set\n   Fresh gems upon thy coronet;\n   And Time, grown lover, shall delight\n   To beautify thee in my sight;\n   And thou shalt ever rule in me\n   Crowned with the light of memory.\n\n\n\n\nMY HEART, WHEN FIRST THE BLACK-BIRD SINGS\n\n\n   MY heart, when first the blackbird sings,\n      My heart drinks in the song:\n   Cool pleasure fills my bosom through\n      And spreads each nerve along.\n\n   My bosom eddies quietly,\n      My heart is stirred and cool\n   As when a wind-moved briar sweeps\n      A stone into a pool\n\n   But unto thee, when thee I meet,\n      My pulses thicken fast,\n   As when the maddened lake grows black\n      And ruffles in the blast.\n\n\n\n\nI DREAMED OF FOREST ALLEYS FAIR\n\n\nI.\n\n\n   I DREAMED of forest alleys fair\n      And fields of gray-flowered grass,\n   Where by the yellow summer moon\n      My Jenny seemed to pass.\n\n   I dreamed the yellow summer moon,\n      Behind a cedar wood,\n   Lay white on fields of rippling grass\n      Where I and Jenny stood.\n\n   I dreamed—but fallen through my dream,\n      In a rainy land I lie\n   Where wan wet morning crowns the hills\n      Of grim reality.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n   I am as one that keeps awake\n      All night in the month of June,\n   That lies awake in bed to watch\n      The trees and great white moon.\n\n   For memories of love are more\n      Than the white moon there above,\n   And dearer than quiet moonshine\n      Are the thoughts of her I love.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n   Last night I lingered long without\n      My last of loves to see.\n   Alas! the moon-white window-panes\n      Stared blindly back on me.\n\n   To-day I hold her very hand,\n      Her very waist embrace—\n   Like clouds across a pool, I read\n      Her thoughts upon her face.\n\n   And yet, as now, through her clear eyes\n      I seek the inner shrine—\n   I stoop to read her virgin heart\n      In doubt if it be mine—\n\n   O looking long and fondly thus,\n      What vision should I see?\n   No vision, but my own white face\n      That grins and mimics me.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n   Once more upon the same old seat\n      In the same sunshiny weather,\n   The elm-trees’ shadows at their feet\n      And foliage move together.\n\n   The shadows shift upon the grass,\n      The dial point creeps on;\n   The clear sun shines, the loiterers pass,\n      As then they passed and shone.\n\n   But now deep sleep is on my heart,\n      Deep sleep and perfect rest.\n   Hope’s flutterings now disturb no more\n      The quiet of my breast.\n\n\n\n\nST. MARTIN’S SUMMER\n\n\n   AS swallows turning backward\n      When half-way o’er the sea,\n   At one word’s trumpet summons\n      They came again to me—\n   The hopes I had forgotten\n      Came back again to me.\n\n   I know not which to credit,\n      O lady of my heart!\n   Your eyes that bade me linger,\n      Your words that bade us part—\n   I know not which to credit,\n      My reason or my heart.\n\n   But be my hopes rewarded,\n      Or be they but in vain,\n   I have dreamed a golden vision,\n      I have gathered in the grain—\n   I have dreamed a golden vision,\n      I have not lived in vain.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n\n   MY first gift and my last, to you\n   I dedicate this fascicle of songs—\n   The only wealth I have:\n   Just as they are, to you.\n\n   I speak the truth in soberness, and say\n   I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes,\n   Had rather hear you praise\n   This bosomful of songs\n\n   Than that the whole, hard world with one consent,\n   In one continuous chorus of applause\n   Poured forth for me and mine\n   The homage of ripe praise.\n\n   I write the finis here against my love,\n   This is my love’s last epitaph and tomb.\n   Here the road forks, and I\n   Go my way, far from yours.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD CHIMÆRAS, OLD RECEIPTS\n\n\n   THE old Chimæras, old receipts\n      For making “happy land,”\n   The old political beliefs\n      Swam close before my hand.\n\n   The grand old communistic myths\n      In a middle state of grace,\n   Quite dead, but not yet gone to Hell,\n      And walking for a space,\n\n   Quite dead, and looking it, and yet\n      All eagerness to show\n   The Social-Contract forgeries\n      By Chatterton—Rousseau—\n\n   A hundred such as these I tried,\n      And hundreds after that,\n   I fitted Social Theories\n      As one would fit a hat!\n\n   Full many a marsh-fire lured me on,\n      I reached at many a star,\n   I reached and grasped them and behold—\n      The stump of a cigar!\n\n   All through the sultry sweltering day\n      The sweat ran down my brow,\n   The still plains heard my distant strokes\n      That have been silenced now.\n\n   This way and that, now up, now down,\n      I hailed full many a blow.\n   Alas! beneath my weary arm\n      The thicket seemed to grow.\n\n   I take the lesson, wipe my brow\n      And throw my axe aside,\n   And, sorely wearied, I go home\n      In the tranquil eventide.\n\n   And soon the rising moon, that lights\n      The eve of my defeat,\n   Shall see me sitting as of yore\n      By my old master’s feet.\n\n\n\n\nPRELUDE\n\n\n   BY sunny market-place and street\n   Wherever I go my drum I beat,\n   And wherever I go in my coat of red\n   The ribbons flutter about my head.\n\n   I seek recruits for wars to come—\n   For slaughterless wars I beat the drum,\n   And the shilling I give to each new ally\n   Is hope to live and courage to die.\n\n   I know that new recruits shall come\n   Wherever I beat the sounding drum,\n   Till the roar of the march by country and town\n   Shall shake the tottering Dagons down.\n\n   For I was objectless as they\n   And loitering idly day by day;\n   But whenever I heard the recruiters come,\n   I left my all to follow the drum.\n\n\n\n\nTHE VANQUISHED KNIGHT\n\n\n   I HAVE left all upon the shameful field,\n      Honour and Hope, my God, and all but life;\n   Spurless, with sword reversed and dinted shield,\n      Degraded and disgraced, I leave the strife.\n\n   From him that hath not, shall there not be taken\n      E’en that he hath, when he deserts the strife?\n   Life left by all life’s benefits forsaken,\n      O keep the promise, Lord, and take the life.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE COMMISSIONERS OF NORTHERN LIGHTS\n\n\n   I SEND to you, commissioners,\n   A paper that may please ye, sirs\n   (For troth they say it might be worse\n         An’ I believe’t)\n   And on your business lay my curse\n         Before I leav’t.\n\n   I thocht I’d serve wi’ you, sirs, yince,\n   But I’ve thocht better of it since;\n   The maitter I will nowise mince,\n         But tell ye true:\n   I’ll service wi’ some ither prince,\n         An’ no wi’ you.\n\n   I’ve no been very deep, ye’ll think,\n   Cam’ delicately to the brink\n   An’ when the water gart me shrink\n         Straucht took the rue,\n   An’ didna stoop my fill to drink—\n         I own it true.\n\n   I kent on cape and isle, a light\n   Burnt fair an’ clearly ilka night;\n   But at the service I took fright,\n         As sune’s I saw,\n   An’ being still a neophite\n         Gaed straucht awa’.\n\n   Anither course I now begin,\n   The weeg I’ll cairry for my sin,\n   The court my voice shall echo in,\n         An’—wha can tell?—\n   Some ither day I may be yin\n         O’ you mysel’.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RELIC TAKEN, WHAT AVAILS THE SHRINE?\n\n\n   THE relic taken, what avails the shrine?\n   The locket, pictureless?  O heart of mine,\n   Art thou not worse than that,\n   Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat?\n\n   Her image nestled closer at my heart\n   Than cherished memories, healed every smart\n   And warmed it more than wine\n   Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine.\n\n   This was the little weather gleam that lit\n   The cloudy promontories—the real charm was\n   That gilded hills and woods\n   And walked beside me thro’ the solitudes.\n\n   The sun is set.  My heart is widowed now\n   Of that companion-thought.  Alone I plough\n   The seas of life, and trace\n   A separate furrow far from her and grace.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE SHELTERED GARDEN GROUND\n\n\n   ABOUT the sheltered garden ground\n      The trees stand strangely still.\n   The vale ne’er seemed so deep before,\n      Nor yet so high the hill.\n\n   An awful sense of quietness,\n      A fulness of repose,\n   Breathes from the dewy garden-lawns,\n      The silent garden rows.\n\n   As the hoof-beats of a troop of horse\n      Heard far across a plain,\n   A nearer knowledge of great thoughts\n      Thrills vaguely through my brain.\n\n   I lean my head upon my arm,\n      My heart’s too full to think;\n   Like the roar of seas, upon my heart\n      Doth the morning stillness sink.\n\n\n\n\nAFTER READING “ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA”\n\n\n   AS when the hunt by holt and field\n      Drives on with horn and strife,\n   Hunger of hopeless things pursues\n      Our spirits throughout life.\n\n   The sea’s roar fills us aching full\n      Of objectless desire—\n   The sea’s roar, and the white moon-shine,\n      And the reddening of the fire.\n\n   Who talks to me of reason now?\n      It would be more delight\n   To have died in Cleopatra’s arms\n      Than be alive to-night.\n\n\n\n\nI KNOW NOT HOW, BUT AS I COUNT\n\n\n   I KNOW not how, but as I count\n      The beads of former years,\n   Old laughter catches in my throat\n      With the very feel of tears.\n\n\n\n\nSPRING SONG\n\n\n   THE air was full of sun and birds,\n      The fresh air sparkled clearly.\n   Remembrance wakened in my heart\n      And I knew I loved her dearly.\n\n   The fallows and the leafless trees\n      And all my spirit tingled.\n   My earliest thought of love, and Spring’s\n      First puff of perfume mingled.\n\n   In my still heart the thoughts awoke,\n      Came lone by lone together—\n   Say, birds and Sun and Spring, is Love\n      A mere affair of weather?\n\n\n\n\nTHE SUMMER SUN SHONE ROUND ME\n\n\n   THE summer sun shone round me,\n      The folded valley lay\n   In a stream of sun and odour,\n      That sultry summer day.\n\n   The tall trees stood in the sunlight\n      As still as still could be,\n   But the deep grass sighed and rustled\n      And bowed and beckoned me.\n\n   The deep grass moved and whispered\n      And bowed and brushed my face.\n   It whispered in the sunshine:\n      “The winter comes apace.”\n\n\n\n\nYOU LOOKED SO TEMPTING IN THE PEW\n\n\n   YOU looked so tempting in the pew,\n      You looked so sly and calm—\n   My trembling fingers played with yours\n      As both looked out the Psalm.\n\n   Your heart beat hard against my arm,\n      My foot to yours was set,\n   Your loosened ringlet burned my cheek\n      Whenever they two met.\n\n   O little, little we hearkened, dear,\n      And little, little cared,\n   Although the parson sermonised,\n      The congregation stared.\n\n\n\n\nLOVE’S VICISSITUDES\n\n\n   AS Love and Hope together\n      Walk by me for a while,\n   Link-armed the ways they travel\n      For many a pleasant mile—\n   Link-armed and dumb they travel,\n      They sing not, but they smile.\n\n   Hope leaving, Love commences\n      To practise on the lute;\n   And as he sings and travels\n      With lingering, laggard foot,\n   Despair plays obligato\n      The sentimental flute.\n\n   Until in singing garments\n      Comes royally, at call—\n   Comes limber-hipped Indiff’rence\n      Free stepping, straight and tall—\n   Comes singing and lamenting,\n      The sweetest pipe of all.\n\n\n\n\nDUDDINGSTONE\n\n\n   WITH caws and chirrupings, the woods\n      In this thin sun rejoice.\n   The Psalm seems but the little kirk\n      That sings with its own voice.\n\n   The cloud-rifts share their amber light\n      With the surface of the mere—\n   I think the very stones are glad\n      To feel each other near.\n\n   Once more my whole heart leaps and swells\n      And gushes o’er with glee;\n   The fingers of the sun and shade\n      Touch music stops in me.\n\n   Now fancy paints that bygone day\n      When you were here, my fair—\n   The whole lake rang with rapid skates\n      In the windless winter air.\n\n   You leaned to me, I leaned to you,\n      Our course was smooth as flight—\n   We steered—a heel-touch to the left,\n      A heel-touch to the right.\n\n   We swung our way through flying men,\n      Your hand lay fast in mine:\n   We saw the shifting crowd dispart,\n      The level ice-reach shine.\n\n   I swear by yon swan-travelled lake,\n      By yon calm hill above,\n   I swear had we been drowned that day\n      We had been drowned in love.\n\n\n\n\nSTOUT MARCHES LEAD TO CERTAIN ENDS\n\n\n   STOUT marches lead to certain ends,\n   We seek no Holy Grail, my friends—\n   That dawn should find us every day\n   Some fraction farther on our way.\n\n   The dumb lands sleep from east to west,\n   They stretch and turn and take their rest.\n   The cock has crown in the steading-yard,\n   But priest and people slumber hard.\n\n   We two are early forth, and hear\n   The nations snoring far and near.\n   So peacefully their rest they take,\n   It seems we are the first awake!\n\n   —Strong heart! this is no royal way,\n   A thousand cross-roads seek the day;\n   And, hid from us, to left and right,\n   A thousand seekers seek the light.\n\n\n\n\nAWAY WITH FUNERAL MUSIC\n\n\n   AWAY with funeral music—set\n      The pipe to powerful lips—\n   The cup of life’s for him that drinks\n      And not for him that sips.\n\n\n\n\nTO SYDNEY\n\n\n   NOT thine

too, O friend, have steeled my heart\n   Boldly to choose the better part,\n   To leave the beaten ways of art,\n      And wholly free\n   To dare, beyond the scanty chart,\n      The deeper sea.\n\n   All vain restrictions left behind,\n   Frail bark! I loose my anchored mind\n   And large, before the prosperous wind\n      Desert the strand—\n   A new Columbus sworn to find\n      The morning land.\n\n   Nor too ambitious, friend.  To thee\n   I own my weakness.

Weary head,\n   Take now thy rest; eyes, close; for no more me\n      Shall hopes untried elate, or ruined vex.\n\n   For thus on love I waited; thus for love\n      Strained all my senses eagerly and long;\n      Thus for her coming ever trimmed my song;\n   Till in the far skies coloured as a dove,\n   A bird gold-coloured flickered far and fled\n      Over the pathless waterwaste for me;\n      And with spread hands I watched the bright bird flee\n   And waited, till before me she dropped dead.\n      O golden bird in these dove-coloured skies\n      How long I sought, how long with wearied eyes\n   I sought, O bird, the promise of thy flight!\n      And now the morn has dawned, the morn has died,\n   The day has come and gone; and once more night\n      About my lone life settles, wild and wide.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUNTARY\n\n\n   HERE in the quiet eve\n   My thankful eyes receive\n         The quiet light.\n   I see the trees stand fair\n   Against the faded air,\n   And star by star prepare\n         The perfect night.\n\n   And in my bosom, lo!\n   Content and quiet grow\n         Toward perfect peace.\n   And now when day is done,\n   Brief day of wind and sun,\n   The pure stars, one by one,\n         Their troop increase.\n\n   Keen pleasure and keen grief\n   Give place to great relief:\n         Farewell my tears!\n   Still sounds toward me float;\n   I hear the bird’s small note,\n   Sheep from the far sheepcote,\n         And lowing steers.\n\n   For lo! the war is done,\n   Lo, now the battle won,\n         The trumpets still.\n   The shepherd’s slender strain,\n   The country sounds again\n   Awake in wood and plain,\n         On haugh and hill.\n\n   Loud wars and loud loves cease.\n   I welcome my release;\n         And hail once more\n   Free foot and way world-wide.\n   And oft at eventide\n   Light love to talk beside\n         The hostel door.\n\n\n\n\nON NOW, ALTHOUGH THE YEAR BE DONE\n\n\n   ON now, although the year be done,\n      Now, although the love be dead,\n         Dead and gone;\n   Hear me, O loved and cherished one,\n      Give me still the hand that led,\n         Led me on.\n\n\n\n\nIN THE GREEN AND GALLANT SPRING\n\n\n   IN the green and gallant Spring,\n   Love and the lyre I thought to sing,\n   And kisses sweet to give and take\n   By the flowery hawthorn brake.\n\n   Now is russet Autumn here,\n   Death and the grave and winter drear,\n   And I must ponder here aloof\n   While the rain is on the roof.\n\n\n\n\nDEATH, TO THE DEAD FOR EVERMORE\n\n\n   DEATH, to the dead for evermore\n   A King, a God, the last, the best of friends—\n   Whene’er this mortal journey ends\n   Death, like a host, comes smiling to the door;\n   Smiling, he greets us, on that tranquil shore\n   Where neither piping bird nor peeping dawn\n   Disturbs the eternal sleep,\n   But in the stillness far withdrawn\n   Our dreamless rest for evermore we keep.\n\n   For as from open windows forth we peep\n   Upon the night-time star beset\n   And with dews for ever wet;\n   So from this garish life the spirit peers;\n   And lo! as a sleeping city death outspread,\n   Where breathe the sleepers evenly; and lo!\n   After the loud wars, triumphs, trumpets, tears\n   And clamour of man’s passion, Death appears,\n   And we must rise and go.\n\n   Soon are eyes tired with sunshine; soon the ears\n   Weary of utterance, seeing all is said;\n   Soon, racked by hopes and fears,\n   The all-pondering, all-contriving head,\n   Weary with all things, wearies of the years;\n   And our sad spirits turn toward the dead;\n   And the tired child, the body, longs for bed.\n\n\n\n\nTO CHARLES BAXTER\n\n\n_On the death of their common friend_, _Mr. John Adam_, _Clerk of court_.\n\n   OUR Johnie’s deid.

A great and aching heart;\n   Wrung hands; and silence; and a long despair.\n   Life—what is life?  Upon a moorland bare\n   To see love coming and see love depart.\n\n\n\n\nSOON OUR FRIENDS PERISH\n\n\n         SOON our friends perish,\n         Soon all we cherish\n   Fades as days darken—goes as

night long\n      In a perplexed forest, comes at length\n   In the first hours, about the matin song,\n      And when the sun uprises in his strength,\n   To the fringed margin of the wood, and sees,\n      Gazing afar before him, many a mile\n   Of falling country, many fields and trees,\n      And cities and bright streams and far-off Ocean’s smile:\n\n   I, O Melampus, halting, stand at gaze:\n      I, liberated, look abroad on life,\n   Love, and distress, and dusty travelling ways,\n      The steersman’s helm, the surgeon’s helpful knife,\n   On the lone ploughman’s earth-upturning share,\n      The revelry of cities and the sound\n   Of seas, and mountain-tops aloof in air,\n      And of the circling earth the unsupported round:\n\n   I, looking, wonder: I, intent, adore;\n      And, O Melampus, reaching forth my hands\n   In adoration, cry aloud and soar\n      In spirit, high above the supine lands\n   And the low caves of mortal things, and flee\n      To the last fields of the universe untrod,\n   Where is no man, nor any earth, nor sea,\n      And the contented soul is all alone with God.\n\n\n\n\nSTRANGE ARE THE WAYS OF MEN\n\n\n   STRANGE are the ways of men,\n      And strange the ways of God!\n   We tread the mazy paths\n      That all our fathers trod.\n\n   We tread them undismayed,\n      And undismayed behold\n   The portents of the sky,\n      The things that were of old.\n\n   The fiery stars pursue\n      Their course in heav’n on high;\n   And round the ‘leaguered town,\n      Crest-tossing heroes cry.\n\n   Crest-tossing heroes cry;\n      And martial fifes declare\n   How small, to mortal minds,\n      Is merely mortal care.\n\n   And to the clang of steel\n      And cry of piercing flute\n   Upon the azure peaks\n      A God shall plant his foot:\n\n   A God in arms shall stand,\n      And seeing wide and far\n   The green and golden earth,\n      The killing tide of war,\n\n   He, with uplifted arm,\n      Shall to the skies proclaim\n   The gleeful fate of man,\n      The noble road to fame!\n\n\n\n\nTHE WIND BLEW SHRILL AND SMART\n\n\n         THE wind blew shrill and smart,\n         And the wind awoke my heart\n   Again to go a-sailing o’er the sea,\n         To hear the cordage moan\n         And the straining timbers groan,\n   And to see the flying pennon lie a-lee.\n\n         O sailor of the fleet,\n         It is time to stir the feet!\n   It’s time to man the dingy and to row!\n         It’s lay your hand in mine\n         And it’s empty down the wine,\n   And it’s drain a health to death before we go!\n\n         To death, my lads, we sail;\n         And it’s death that blows the gale\n   And death that holds the tiller as we ride.\n         For he’s the king of all\n         In the tempest and the squall,\n   And the ruler of the Ocean wild and wide!\n\n\n\n\nMAN SAILS THE DEEP AWHILE\n\n\n   MAN sails the deep awhile;\n         Loud runs the roaring tide;\n         The seas are wild and wide;\n   O’er many a salt, o’er many a desert mile,\n         The unchained breakers ride,\n         The quivering stars beguile.\n\n   Hope bears the sole command;\n         Hope, with unshaken eyes,\n         Sees flaw and storm arise;\n   Hope, the good steersman, with unwearying hand,\n         Steers, under changing skies,\n         Unchanged toward the land.\n\n   O wind that bravely blows!\n         O hope that sails with all\n         Where stars and voices call!\n   O ship undaunted that forever goes\n         Where God, her admiral,\n         His battle signal shows!\n\n   What though the seas and wind\n         Far on the deep should whelm\n         Colours and sails and helm?\n   There, too, you touch that port that you designed—\n         There, in the mid-seas’ realm,\n         Shall you that haven find.\n\n   Well hast thou sailed: now die,\n         To die is not to sleep.\n         Still your true course you keep,\n   O sailor soul, still sailing for the sky;\n         And fifty fathom deep\n         Your colours still shall fly.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COCK’S CLEAR VOICE INTO THE CLEARER AIR\n\n\n   THE cock’s clear voice into the clearer air\n      Where westward far I roam,\n   Mounts with a thrill of hope,\n      Falls with a sigh of home.\n\n   A rural sentry, he from farm and field\n      The coming morn descries,\n   And, mankind’s bugler, wakes\n      The camp of enterprise.\n\n   He sings the morn upon the westward hills\n      Strange and remote and wild;\n   He sings it in the land\n      Where once I was a child.\n\n   He brings to me dear voices of the past,\n      The old land and the years:\n   My father calls for me,\n      My weeping spirit hears.\n\n   Fife, fife, into the golden air, O bird,\n      And sing the morning in;\n   For the old days are past\n      And new days begin.\n\n\n\n\nNOW WHEN THE NUMBER OF MY YEARS\n\n\n   NOW when the number of my years\n      Is all fulfilled, and I\n      From sedentary life\n      Shall rouse me up to die,\n         Bury me low and let me lie\n         Under the wide and starry sky.\n         Joying to live, I joyed to die,\n         Bury me low and let me lie.\n\n   Clear was my soul, my deeds were free,\n      Honour was called my name,\n      I fell not back from fear\n      Nor followed after fame.\n         Bury me low and let me lie\n         Under the wide and starry sky.\n         Joying to live, I joyed to die,\n         Bury me low and let me lie.\n\n   Bury me low in valleys green\n      And where the milder breeze\n      Blows fresh along the stream,\n      Sings roundly in the trees—\n         Bury me low and let me lie\n         Under the wide and starry sky.\n         Joying to live, I joyed to die,\n         Bury me low and let me lie.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT MAN MAY LEARN, WHAT MAN MAY DO\n\n\n   WHAT man may learn, what man may do,\n   Of right or wrong of false or true,\n   While, skipper-like, his course he steers\n   Through nine and twenty mingled years,\n   Half misconceived and half forgot,\n   So much I know and practise not.\n\n   Old are the words of wisdom, old\n   The counsels of the wise and bold:\n   To close the ears, to check the tongue,\n   To keep the pining spirit young;\n   To act the right, to say the true,\n   And to be kind whate’er you do.\n\n   Thus we across the modern stage\n   Follow the wise of every age;\n   And, as oaks grow and rivers run\n   Unchanged in the unchanging sun,\n   So the eternal march of man\n   Goes forth on an eternal plan.\n\n\n\n\nSMALL IS THE TRUST WHEN LOVE IS GREEN\n\n\n   SMALL is the trust when love is green\n      In sap of early years;\n   A little thing steps in between\n      And kisses turn to tears.\n\n   Awhile—and see how love be grown\n      In loveliness and power!\n   Awhile, it loves the sweets alone,\n      But next it loves the sour.\n\n   A little love is none at all\n      That wanders or that fears;\n   A hearty love dwells still at call\n      To kisses or to tears.\n\n   Such then be mine, my love to give,\n      And such be yours to take:—\n   A faith to hold, a life to live,\n      For lovingkindness’ sake:\n\n   Should you be sad, should you be gay,\n      Or should you prove unkind,\n   A love to hold the growing way\n      And keep the helping mind:—\n\n   A love to turn the laugh on care\n      When wrinkled care appears,\n   And, with an equal will, to share\n      Your losses and your tears.\n\n\n\n\nKNOW YOU THE RIVER NEAR TO GREZ\n\n\n   KNOW you the river near to Grez,\n      A river deep and clear?\n   Among the lilies all the way,\n   That ancient river runs to-day\n      From snowy weir to weir.\n\n   Old as the Rhine of great renown,\n      She hurries clear and fast,\n   She runs amain by field and town\n   From south to north, from up to down,\n      To present on from past.\n\n   The love I hold was borne by her;\n      And now, though far away,\n   My lonely spirit hears the stir\n   Of water round the starling spur\n      Beside the bridge at Grez.\n\n   So may that love forever hold\n      In life an equal pace;\n   So may that love grow never old,\n   But, clear and pure and fountain-cold,\n      Go on from grace to grace.\n\n\n\n\nIT’S FORTH ACROSS THE ROARING FOAM\n\n\n   IT’S forth across the roaring foam, and on towards the west,\n   It’s many a lonely league from home, o’er many a mountain crest,\n   From where the dogs of Scotland call the sheep around the fold,\n   To where the flags are flying beside the Gates of Gold.\n\n   Where all the deep-sea galleons ride that come to bring the corn,\n   Where falls the fog at eventide and blows the breeze at morn;\n   It’s there that I was sick and sad, alone and poor and cold,\n   In yon distressful city beside the Gates of Gold.\n\n   I slept as one that nothing knows; but far along my way,\n   Before the morning God rose and planned the coming day;\n   Afar before me forth he went, as through the sands of old,\n   And chose the friends to help me beside the Gates of Gold.\n\n   I have been near, I have been far, my back’s been at the wall,\n   Yet aye and ever shone the star to guide me through it all:\n   The love of God, the help of man, they both shall make me bold\n   Against the gates of darkness as beside the Gates of Gold.\n\n\n\n\nAN ENGLISH BREEZE\n\n\n   UP with the sun, the breeze arose,\n   Across the talking corn she goes,\n   And smooth she rustles far and wide\n   Through all the voiceful countryside.\n\n   Through all the land her tale she tells;\n   She spins, she tosses, she compels\n   The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails\n   And all the trees in all the dales.\n\n   God calls us, and the day prepares\n   With nimble, gay and gracious airs:\n   And from Penzance to Maidenhead\n   The roads last night He watered.\n\n   God calls us from inglorious ease,\n   Forth and to travel with the breeze\n   While, swift and singing, smooth and strong\n   She gallops by the fields along.\n\n\n\n\nAS IN THEIR FLIGHT THE BIRDS OF SONG\n\n\n   AS in their flight the birds of song\n   Halt here and there in sweet and sunny dales,\n   But halt not overlong;\n   The time one rural song to sing\n   They pause; then following bounteous gales\n   Steer forward on the wing:\n   Sun-servers they, from first to last,\n   Upon the sun they wait\n   To ride the sailing blast.\n\n   So he awhile in our contested state,\n   Awhile abode, not longer, for his Sun—\n   Mother we say, no tenderer name we know—\n   With whose diviner glow\n   His early days had shone,\n   Now to withdraw her radiance had begun.\n   Or lest a wrong I say, not she withdrew,\n   But the loud stream of men day after day\n   And great dust columns of the common way\n   Between them grew and grew:\n   And he and she for evermore might yearn,\n   But to the spring the rivulets not return\n   Nor to the bosom comes the child again.\n\n   And he (O may we fancy so!),\n   He, feeling time forever flow\n   And flowing bear him forth and far away\n   From that dear ingle where his life began\n   And all his treasure lay—\n   He, waxing into man,\n   And ever farther, ever closer wound\n   In this obstreperous world’s ignoble round,\n   From that poor prospect turned his face away.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PIPER\n\n\n   AGAIN I hear you piping, for I know the tune so well,—\n      You rouse the heart to wander and be free,\n   Tho’ where you learned your music, not the God of song can tell,\n      For you pipe the open highway and the sea.\n   O piper, lightly footing, lightly piping on your way,\n      Tho’ your music thrills and pierces far and near,\n   I tell you you had better pipe to someone else to-day,\n      For you cannot pipe my fancy from my dear.\n\n   You sound the note of travel through the hamlet and the town;\n      You would lure the holy angels from on high;\n   And not a man can hear you, but he throws the hammer down\n      And is off to see the countries ere he die.\n   But now no more I wander, now unchanging here I stay;\n      By my love, you find me safely sitting here:\n   And pipe you ne’er so sweetly, till you pipe the hills away,\n      You can never pipe my fancy from my dear.\n\n\n\n\nTO MRS. MACMARLAND\n\n\n   IN Schnee der Alpen—so it runs\n      To those divine accords—and here\n   We dwell in Alpine snows and suns,\n      A motley crew, for half the year:\n   A motley crew, we dwell to taste—\n      A shivering band in hope and fear—\n   That sun upon the snowy waste,\n      That Alpine ether cold and clear.\n\n   Up from the laboured plains, and up\n      From low sea-levels, we arise\n   To drink of that diviner cup\n      The rarer air, the clearer skies;\n   For, as the great, old, godly King\n      From mankind’s turbid valley cries,\n   So all we mountain-lovers sing:\n      I to the hills will lift mine eyes.\n\n   The bells that ring, the peaks that climb,\n      The frozen snow’s unbroken curd\n   Might yet revindicate in rhyme\n      The pauseless stream, the absent bird.\n   In vain—for to the deeps of life\n      You, lady, you my heart have stirred;\n   And since you say you love my life,\n      Be sure I love you for the word.\n\n   Of kindness, here I nothing say—\n      Such loveless kindnesses there are\n   In that grimacing, common way,\n      That old, unhonoured social war.\n   Love but my dog and love my love,\n      Adore with me a common star—\n   I value not the rest above\n      The ashes of a bad cigar.\n\n\n\n\nTO MISS CORNISH\n\n\n   THEY tell me, lady, that to-day\n      On that unknown Australian strand—\n   Some time ago, so far away—\n      Another lady joined the band.\n   She joined the company of those\n      Lovelily dowered, nobly planned,\n   Who, smiling, still forgive their foes\n      And keep their friends in close command.\n\n   She, lady, as I learn, was one\n      Among the many rarely good;\n   And destined still to be a sun\n      Through every dark and rainy mood:—\n   She, as they told me, far had come,\n      By sea and land, o’er many a rood:—\n   Admired by all, beloved by some,\n      She was yourself, I understood.\n\n   But, compliment apart and free\n      From all constraint of verses, may\n   Goodness and honour, grace and glee,\n      Attend you ever on your way—\n   Up to the measure of your will,\n      Beyond all power of mine to say—\n   As she and I desire you still,\n      Miss Cornish, on your natal day.\n\n\n\n\nTALES OF ARABIA\n\n\n   YES, friend, I own these tales of Arabia\n   Smile not, as smiled their flawless originals,\n      Age-old but yet untamed, for ages\n      Pass and the magic is undiminished.\n\n   Thus, friend, the tales of the old Camaralzaman,\n   Ayoub, the Slave of Love, or the Calendars,\n      Blind-eyed and ill-starred royal scions,\n      Charm us in age as they charmed in childhood.\n\n   Fair ones, beyond all numerability,\n   Beam from the palace, beam on humanity,\n      Bright-eyed, in truth, yet soul-less houris\n      Offering pleasure and only pleasure.\n\n   Thus they, the venal Muses Arabian,\n   Unlike, indeed, the nobler divinities,\n      Greek Gods or old time-honoured muses,\n      Easily proffer unloved caresses.\n\n   Lost, lost, the man who mindeth the minstrelsy;\n   Since still, in sandy, glittering pleasances,\n      Cold, stony fruits, gem-like but quite in-\n      Edible, flatter and wholly starve him.\n\n\n\n\nBEHOLD, AS GOBLINS DARK OF MIEN\n\n\n   BEHOLD, as goblins dark of mien\n      And portly tyrants dyed with crime\n   Change, in the transformation scene,\n      At Christmas, in the pantomime,\n\n   Instanter, at the prompter’s cough,\n      The fairy bonnets them, and they\n   Throw their abhorred carbuncles off\n      And blossom like the flowers in May.\n\n   —So mankind, to angelic eyes,\n      So, through the scenes of life below,\n   In life’s ironical disguise,\n      A travesty of man, ye go:\n\n   But fear not: ere the curtain fall,\n      Death in the transformation scene\n   Steps forward from her pedestal,\n      Apparent, as the fairy Queen;\n\n   And coming, frees you in a trice\n      From all your lendings—lust of fame,\n   Ungainly virtue, ugly vice,\n      Terror and tyranny and shame.\n\n   So each, at last himself, for good\n      In that dear country lays him down,\n   At last beloved and understood\n      And pure in feature and renown.\n\n\n\n\nSTILL I LOVE TO RHYME\n\n\n   STILL I love to rhyme, and still more, rhyming, to wander\n      Far from the commoner way;\n   Old-time trills and falls by the brook-side still do I ponder,\n      Dreaming to-morrow to-day.\n\n   Come here, come, revive me, Sun-God, teach me, Apollo,\n      Measures descanted before;\n   Since I ancient verses, I emulous follow,\n      Prints in the marbles of yore.\n\n   Still strange, strange, they sound in old-young raiment invested,\n      Songs for the brain to forget—\n   Young song-birds elate to grave old temples benested\n      Piping and chirruping yet.\n\n   Thoughts?  No thought has yet unskilled attempted to flutter\n      Trammelled so vilely in verse;\n   He who writes but aims at fame and his bread and his butter,\n      Won with a groan and a curse.\n\n\n\n\nLONG TIME I LAY IN LITTLE EASE\n\n\n   LONG time I lay in little ease\n      Where, placed by the Turanian,\n   Marseilles, the many-masted, sees\n      The blue Mediterranean.\n\n   Now songful in the hour of sport,\n      Now riotous for wages,\n   She camps around her ancient port,\n      As ancient of the ages.\n\n   Algerian airs through all the place\n      Unconquerably sally;\n   Incomparable women pace\n      The shadows of the alley.\n\n   And high o’er dark and graving yard\n      And where the sky is paler,\n   The golden virgin of the guard\n      Shines, beckoning the sailor.\n\n   She hears the city roar on high,\n      Thief, prostitute, and banker;\n   She sees the masted vessels lie\n      Immovably at anchor.\n\n   She sees the snowy islets dot\n      The sea’s immortal azure,\n   And If, that castellated spot,\n      Tower, turret, and embrasure.\n\n\n\n\nFLOWER GOD, GOD OF THE SPRING\n\n\n   FLOWER god, god of the spring, beautiful, bountiful,\n   Cold-dyed shield in the sky, lover of versicles,\n      Here I wander in April\n      Cold, grey-headed; and still to my\n   Heart, Spring comes with a bound, Spring the deliverer,\n   Spring, song-leader in woods, chorally resonant;\n      Spring, flower-planter in meadows,\n      Child-conductor in willowy\n   Fields deep dotted with bloom, daisies and crocuses:\n   Here that child from his heart drinks of eternity:\n      O child, happy are children!\n      She still smiles on their innocence,\n   She, dear mother in God, fostering violets,\n   Fills earth full of her scents, voices and violins:\n      Thus one cunning in music\n      Wakes old chords in the memory:\n   Thus fair earth in the Spring leads her performances.\n   One more touch of the bow, smell of the virginal\n      Green—one more, and my bosom\n      Feels new life with an ecstasy.\n\n\n\n\nCOME, MY BELOVED, HEAR FROM ME\n\n\n   COME, my beloved, hear from me\n   Tales of the woods or open sea.\n   Let our aspiring fancy rise\n   A wren’s flight higher toward the skies;\n   Or far from cities, brown and bare,\n   Play at the least in open air.\n   In all the tales men hear us tell\n   Still let the unfathomed ocean swell,\n   Or shallower forest sound abroad\n   Below the lonely stars of God;\n   In all, let something still be done,\n   Still in a corner shine the sun,\n   Slim-ankled maids be fleet of foot,\n   Nor man disown the rural flute.\n   Still let the hero from the start\n   In honest sweat and beats of heart\n   Push on along the untrodden road\n   For some inviolate abode.\n   Still, O beloved, let me hear\n   The great bell beating far and near—\n   The odd, unknown, enchanted gong\n   That on the road hales men along,\n   That from the mountain calls afar,\n   That lures a vessel from a star,\n   And with a still, aerial sound\n   Makes all the earth enchanted ground.\n   Love, and the love of life and act\n   Dance, live and sing through all our furrowed tract;\n   Till the great God enamoured gives\n   To him who reads, to him who lives,\n   That rare and fair romantic strain\n   That whoso hears must hear again.\n\n\n\n\nSINCE YEARS AGO FOR EVERMORE\n\n\n   SINCE years ago for evermore\n   My cedar ship I drew to shore;\n   And to the road and riverbed\n   And the green, nodding reeds, I said\n   Mine ignorant and last farewell:\n   Now with content at home I dwell,\n   And now divide my sluggish life\n   Betwixt my verses and my wife:\n   In vain; for when the lamp is lit\n   And by the laughing fire I sit,\n   Still with the tattered atlas spread\n   Interminable roads I tread.\n\n\n\n\nENVOY FOR “A CHILD’S GARDEN OF VERSES”\n\n\n   WHETHER upon the garden seat\n   You lounge with your uplifted feet\n   Under the May’s whole Heaven of blue;\n   Or whether on the sofa you,\n   No grown up person being by,\n   Do some soft corner occupy;\n   Take you this volume in your hands\n   And enter into other lands,\n   For lo! (as children feign) suppose\n   You, hunting in the garden rows,\n   Or in the lumbered attic, or\n   The cellar—a nail-studded door\n   And dark, descending stairway found\n   That led to kingdoms underground:\n   There standing, you should hear with ease\n   Strange birds a-singing, or the trees\n   Swing in big robber woods, or bells\n   On many fairy citadels:\n\n   There passing through (a step or so—\n   Neither mamma nor nurse need know!)\n   From your nice nurseries you would pass,\n   Like Alice through the Looking-Glass\n   Or Gerda following Little Ray,\n   To wondrous countries far away.\n   Well, and just so this volume can\n   Transport each little maid or man\n   Presto from where they live away\n   Where other children used to play.\n   As from the house your mother sees\n   You playing round the garden trees,\n   So you may see if you but look\n   Through the windows of this book\n   Another child far, far away\n   And in another garden play.\n   But do not think you can at all,\n   By knocking on the window, call\n   That child to hear you.  He intent\n   Is still on his play-business bent.\n   He does not hear, he will not look,\n   Nor yet be lured out of this book.\n   For long ago, the truth to say,\n   He has grown up and gone away;\n   And it is but a child of air\n   That lingers in the garden there.\n\n\n\n\nFOR RICHMOND’S GARDEN WALL\n\n\n   WHEN Thomas set this tablet here,\n   Time laughed at the vain chanticleer;\n   And ere the moss had dimmed the stone,\n   Time had defaced that garrison.\n   Now I in turn keep watch and ward\n   In my red house, in my walled yard\n   Of sunflowers, sitting here at ease\n   With friends and my bright canvases.\n   But hark, and you may hear quite plain\n   Time’s chuckled laughter in the lane.\n\n\n\n\nHAIL, GUEST, AND ENTER FREELY!\n\n\n   HAIL, guest, and enter freely!

Five years back,\n   When you first girded for this arduous track,\n   And under various whimsical pretexts\n   Endowed another with your damned defects,\n   Could you have dreamed in your despondent vein\n   That the kind God would make your path so plain?\n   Non nobis, domine!

and to your perch aloof,\n   Where Balzac all in yellow dressed\n   And the dear Webster of the west\n   Encircle the prepotent throne\n   Of Shakespeare and of Calderon,\n   Shall climb an upstart.\n\n   There with these\n   You shall give ear to breaking seas\n   And windmills turning in the breeze,\n   A distant undetermined din\n   Without;

voice perhaps the child may hear;\n   And, pitying, you may turn your view\n   On that poor father whom you never knew.\n\n   Alas! alone he sits, who then,\n   Immortal among mortal men,\n   Sat hand

The whole year’s sweat and study,\n      And the whole year’s sowing time,\n   Comes now to the perfect harvest,\n      And ripens now into rhyme.\n   For we that sow in the Autumn,\n      We reap our

That little top-knot, white and red,\n   That quaintly crowns your graceful head,\n      No bigger than a flower,\n   Is set with such a witching art,\n   Is so provocatively smart,\n   I’d like to wear it on my heart,\n      An order for an hour!\n\n   O graceful housemaid, tall and fair,\n   I love your shy imperial air,\n   And always loiter on the stair\n      When you are going by.\n   A

 TO all that love the far and blue:\n      Whether, from dawn to eve, on foot\n   The fleeing corners ye pursue,\n      Nor weary of the vain pursuit;\n   Or whether down the singing stream,\n      Paddle in hand, jocund ye shoot,\n   To splash beside the splashing bream\n      Or anchor by the willow root:\n\n   Or, bolder, from the narrow shore\n      Put forth, that cedar ark to steer,\n   Among the seabirds and the roar\n      Of the great sea, profound and clear;\n   Or, lastly if in heart ye roam,\n      Not caring to do else, and hear,\n   Safe sitting by the fire at home,\n      Footfalls in Utah or Pamere:\n\n   Though long the way, though hard to bear\n      The sun and rain, the dust and dew;\n   Though still attainment and despair\n      Inter the old, despoil the new;\n

grown great and staid,\n   And in long raiment wondrously arrayed,\n   She may take pleasure with a smile to know\n   How she delighted men-folk long ago.\n   For her long after, then, this tale I tell\n   Of the two fans and fairy Rosabelle.\n   Hot was the day; her weary sire and I\n   Sat in our chairs companionably nigh,\n   Each with a headache sat her sire and I.\n\n   Instant the hostess waked: she viewed the scene,\n   Divined the giants’ languor by their mien,\n   And with hospitable care\n   Tackled at once an Atlantean chair.\n   Her pigmy stature scarce attained the seat—\n   She dragged it where she would, and with her feet\n   Surmounted; thence, a Phaeton launched, she crowned\n   The vast plateau of the piano, found\n   And culled a pair of fans; wherewith equipped,\n   Our mountaineer back to the level slipped;\n   And being landed, with considerate eyes,\n   Betwixt her elders dealt her double prize;\n   The small to me, the greater to her sire.\n   As painters now advance and now retire\n   Before the growing canvas, and anon\n   Once more approach and put the climax on:\n   So she awhile withdrew, her piece she viewed—\n   For half a moment half supposed it good—\n   Spied her mistake, nor sooner spied than ran\n   To remedy; and with the greater fan,\n   In gracious better thought, equipped the guest.\n\n   From ill to well, from better on to best,\n   Arts move; the homely, like the plastic kind;\n   And high ideals fired that infant mind.\n   Once more she backed, once more a space apart\n   Considered and reviewed her work of art:\n   Doubtful at first, and gravely yet awhile;\n   Till all her features blossomed in a smile.\n   And the child, waking at the call of bliss,\n   To each she ran, and took and gave a kiss.\n\n\n\n\nNOW BARE TO THE BEHOLDER’S EYE\n\n\n   NOW bare to the beholder’s eye\n   Your late denuded bindings lie,\n   Subsiding slowly where they fell,\n   A disinvested citadel;\n   The obdurate corset, Cupid’s foe,\n   The Dutchman’s breeches frilled below.\n   Those that the lover notes to note,\n   And white and crackling petticoat.\n\n   From these, that on the ground repose,\n   Their lady lately re-arose;\n   And laying by the lady’s name,\n   A living woman re-became.\n   Of her, that from the public eye\n   They do enclose and fortify,\n   Now, lying scattered as they fell,\n   An indiscreeter tale they tell:\n   Of that more soft and secret her\n   Whose daylong fortresses they were,\n   By fading warmth, by lingering print,\n   These now discarded scabbards hint.\n\n   A twofold change the ladies know:\n   First, in the morn the bugles blow,\n   And they, with floral hues and scents,\n   Man their beribboned battlements.\n   But let the stars appear, and they\n   Shed inhumanities away;\n   And from the changeling fashion see,\n   Through comic and through sweet degree,\n   In nature’s toilet unsurpassed,\n   Forth leaps the laughing girl at last.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOUR-TREE DEN\n\n\n

Year by year\n   The narrowing toil grows closer round his feet;\n   With disenchanting touch rude-handed time\n   The unlovely web discloses, and strange fear\n   Leads him at last to eld’s inclement seat,\n   The bitter north of life—a frozen clime.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n   As Daniel, bird-alone, in that far land,\n   Kneeling in fervent prayer, with heart-sick eyes\n   Turned thro’ the casement toward the westering skies;\n   Or as untamed Elijah, that red brand\n   Among the starry prophets; or that band\n   And company of Faithful sanctities\n   Who in all times, when persecutions rise,\n   Cherish forgotten creeds with fostering hand:\n   Such do ye seem to me, light-hearted crew,\n   O turned to friendly arts with all your will,\n   That keep a little chapel sacred still,\n   One rood of Holy-land in this bleak earth\n   Sequestered still (our homage surely due!)\n   To the twin Gods of mirthful wine and mirth.\n\n   About my fields, in the broad sun\n   And blaze of noon, there goeth one,\n   Barefoot and robed in blue, to scan\n   With the hard eye of the husbandman\n   My harvests and my cattle.  Her,\n   When even puts the birds astir\n   And day has set in the great woods,\n   We seek, among her garden roods,\n   With bells and cries in vain: the while\n   Lamps, plate, and the decanter smile\n   On the forgotten board.  But she,\n   Deaf, blind, and prone on face and knee,\n   Forgets time, family, and feast,\n   And digs like a demented beast.\n\n   Tall as a guardsman, pale as the east at dawn,\n   Who strides in strange apparel on the lawn?\n   Rails for his breakfast? routs his vassals out\n   (Like boys escaped from school) with song and shout?\n   Kind and unkind, his Maker’s final freak,\n   Part we deride the child, part dread the antique!\n   See where his gang, like frogs, among the dew\n   Crouch at their duty, an unquiet crew;\n   Adjust their staring kilts; and their swift eyes\n   Turn still to him who sits to supervise.\n   He in the midst, perched on a fallen tree,\n   Eyes them at labour; and, guitar on knee,\n   Now ministers alarm, now scatters joy,\n   Now twangs a halting chord, now tweaks a boy.\n   Thorough in all, my resolute vizier\n   Plays both the despot and the volunteer,\n   Exacts with fines obedience to my laws,\n   And for his music, too, exacts applause.\n\n   The Adorner of the uncomely—those\n   Amidst whose tall battalions goes\n   Her pretty person out and in\n   All day with an endearing din,\n   Of censure and encouragement;\n   And when all else is tried in vain\n   See her sit down and weep again.\n   She weeps to conquer;\n   She varies on her grenadiers\n   From satire up to girlish tears!\n\n   Or rather to behold her when\n   She plies for me the unresting pen,\n   And when the loud assault of squalls\n   Resounds upon the roof and walls,\n   And the low thunder growls and I\n   Raise my dictating voice on high.\n\n   What glory for a boy of ten\n   Who now must three gigantic men\n   And two enormous, dapple grey\n   New Zealand pack-horses array\n   And lead, and wisely resolute\n   Our day-long business execute\n   In the far shore-side town.  His soul\n   Glows in his bosom like a coal;\n   His innocent eyes glitter again,\n   And his hand trembles on the rein.\n   Once he reviews his whole command,\n   And chivalrously planting hand\n   On hip—a borrowed attitude—\n   Rides off downhill into the wood.\n\n   I meanwhile in the populous house apart\n   Sit snugly chambered, and my silent art\n   Uninterrupted, unremitting ply\n   Before the dawn, by morning lamplight, by\n   The glow of smelting noon, and when the sun\n   Dips past my westering hill and day is done;\n   So, bending still over my trade of words,\n   I hear the morning and the evening birds,\n   The morning and the evening stars behold;\n   So there apart I sit as once of old\n   Napier in wizard Merchiston; and my\n   Brown innocent aides in home and husbandry\n   Wonder askance.  What ails the boss? they ask.\n   Him, richest of the rich, an endless task\n   Before the earliest birds or servants stir\n   Calls and detains him daylong prisoner?\n   He whose innumerable dollars hewed\n   This cleft in the boar and devil-haunted wood,\n   And bade therein, from sun to seas and skies,\n   His many-windowed, painted palace rise\n   Red-roofed, blue-walled, a rainbow on the hill,\n   A wonder in the forest glade: he still,\n\n   Unthinkable Aladdin, dawn and dark,\n   Scribbles and scribbles, like a German clerk.\n   We see the fact, but tell, O tell us why?\n   My reverend washman and wise butler cry.\n   Meanwhile at times the manifold\n   Imperishable perfumes of the past\n   And coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast:\n   And I remember the white rime, the loud\n   Lamplitten city, shops, and the changing crowd;\n   And I remember home and the old time,\n   The winding river, the white moving rhyme,\n   The autumn robin by the river-side\n   That pipes in the grey eve.\n\n   The old lady (so they say), but I\n   Admire your young vitality.\n   Still brisk of foot, still busy and keen\n   In and about and up and down.\n\n   I hear you pass with bustling feet\n   The long verandahs round, and beat\n   Your bell, and “Lotu!  Lotu!” cry;\n   Thus calling our queer company,\n   In morning or in evening dim,\n   To prayers and the oft mangled hymn.\n\n   All day you watch across the sky\n   The silent, shining cloudlands ply,\n   That, huge as countries, swift as birds,\n   Beshade the isles by halves and thirds,\n   Till each with battlemented crest\n   Stands anchored in the ensanguined west,\n   An Alp enchanted.  All the day\n   You hear the exuberant wind at play,\n   In vast, unbroken voice uplift,\n   In roaring tree, round whistling clift.\n\n\n\n\nAIR OF DIABELLI’S\n\n\n   CALL it to mind, O my love.\n   Dear were your eyes as the day,\n   Bright as the day and the sky;\n   Like the stream of gold and the sky above,\n   Dear were your eyes in the grey.\n   We have lived, my love, O, we have lived, my love!\n   Now along the silent river, azure\n   Through the sky’s inverted image,\n   Softly swam the boat that bore our love,\n   Swiftly ran the shallow of our love\n   Through the heaven’s inverted image,\n   In the reedy mazes round the river.\n   See along the silent river,\n\n   See of old the lover’s shallop steer.\n   Berried brake and reedy island,\n   Heaven below and only heaven above.\n   Through the sky’s inverted image\n   Swiftly swam the boat that bore our love.\n   Berried brake and reedy island,\n   Mirrored flower and shallop gliding by.\n   All the earth and all the sky were ours,\n   Silent sat the wafted lovers,\n   Bound with grain and watched by all the sky,\n   Hand to hand and eye to . . . eye.\n\n   Days of April, airs of Eden,\n   Call to mind how bright the vanished angel hours,\n   Golden hours of evening,\n   When our boat drew homeward filled with flowers.\n   O darling, call them to mind; love the past, my love.\n   Days of April, airs of Eden.\n   How the glory died through golden hours,\n   And the shining moon arising;\n   How the boat drew homeward filled with flowers.\n   Age and winter close us slowly in.\n\n   Level river, cloudless heaven,\n   Islanded reed mazes, silver weirs;\n   How the silent boat with silver\n   Threads the inverted forest as she goes,\n   Broke the trembling green of mirrored trees.\n   O, remember, and remember\n   How the berries hung in garlands.\n\n   Still in the river see the shallop floats.\n   Hark!

She, the flower of girls,\n   Outshone the light of Erythræan pearls;\n   The teeth of India that with polish glow,\n   The untouched lilies or the morning snow.\n   Her tresses did gold-dust outshine\n   And fair hair of women of the Rhine.\n   Compared to her the peacock seemed not fair,\n   The squirrel lively, or the phoenix rare;\n   Her on whose pyre the smoke still hovering waits;\n   Her whom the greedy and unequal fates\n   On the sixth dawning of her natal day,\n   My child-love and my playmate—snatcht away.\n\n\n\n\nAD PISCATOREM\n\n\n   FOR these are sacred fishes all\n   Who know that lord that is the lord of all;\n   Come to the brim and nose the friendly hand\n   That sways and can beshadow all the land.\n   Nor only so, but have their names, and come\n   When they are summoned by the Lord of Rome.\n   Here once his line an impious Lybian threw;\n   And as with tremulous reed his prey he drew,\n   Straight, the light failed him.\n   He groped, nor found the prey that he had ta’en.\n   Now as a warning to the fisher clan\n   Beside the lake he sits, a beggarman.\n   Thou, then, while still thine innocence is pure,\n   Flee swiftly, nor presume to set thy lure;\n   Respect these fishes, for their friends are great;\n   And in the waters empty all thy bait.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n          BILLING AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, GUILDFORD, ENGLAND."
